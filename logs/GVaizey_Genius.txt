Parsing [sent. 1 len. 27]: Title : The Daughters of a Genius Author : Mrs. George de Horne Vaizey THE DAUGHTERS OF A GENIUS , BY MRS GEORGE DE HORNE VAIZEY .
Parsing [sent. 2 len. 3]: CHAPTER ONE .
Parsing [sent. 3 len. 3]: UNKNOWN COUSINS .
Parsing [sent. 4 len. 9]: `` What is your letter , my dear ?
Parsing [sent. 5 len. 4]: You seem annoyed .
Parsing [sent. 6 len. 41]: _ No _ bad news , I hope , '' said the master of Chedworth Manor , looking across the table to where his wife eat behind the urn , frowning over the sheet which she held in her hand .
Parsing [sent. 7 len. 24]: She was a handsome , well-preserved woman , with aquiline features , thin lips , and eyes of a pale , indefinite blue .
Parsing [sent. 8 len. 18]: She looked up as he spoke , then threw down the letter with a sigh of impatience .
Parsing [sent. 9 len. 9]: `` Oh , bad news , of course !
Parsing [sent. 10 len. 17]: When did we ever return from a holiday without finding something of the sort awaiting us ?
Parsing [sent. 11 len. 6]: It 's from Stephen Charrington .
Parsing [sent. 12 len. 23]: He says he would have written before , but heard that we were abroad , and did not know where to direct .
Parsing [sent. 13 len. 4]: Edgar is dead .
Parsing [sent. 14 len. 14]: He died a fortnight ago , and the funeral was on Friday week .
Parsing [sent. 15 len. 25]: I never knew a man who married improvidently and had a huge family who did _ not _ die before he reached middle age .
Parsing [sent. 16 len. 13]: It seems a judgment on them ; and here is another instance .
Parsing [sent. 17 len. 5]: Forty-nine his last birthday !
Parsing [sent. 18 len. 13]: He ought to have lived for another twenty years at least . ''
Parsing [sent. 19 len. 33]: Mrs Loftus spoke with an air of injury which seemed to imply that the deceased gentleman had died out of pure perversity , and her husband knitted his brows in disapproving fashion .
Parsing [sent. 20 len. 30]: Even after twenty-five years of married life his wife 's heartless selfishness could give him a twinge of shocked surprise when , as now , it was obtrusively displayed .
Parsing [sent. 21 len. 34]: He himself made no claims to philanthropy , but one expected some natural feeling from a woman ; and with all his faults , Edgar Charrington had had close claim on her sympathy .
Parsing [sent. 22 len. 14]: `` He was your brother , my dear , '' he said dryly .
Parsing [sent. 23 len. 17]: `` I suppose the poor fellow would not have died if he could have helped it .
Parsing [sent. 24 len. 22]: We have not seen anything of him for a long time , but he used to be a most attractive fellow .
Parsing [sent. 25 len. 9]: I thought he would have made his mark .
Parsing [sent. 26 len. 32]: Never met a man with so many gifts -- painting , music , writing ; he used to take them up in turn , and do equally well in each . ''
Parsing [sent. 27 len. 6]: `` But excel in nothing !
Parsing [sent. 28 len. 31]: That was the undoing of Edgar ; he had not the application to keep to one thing at a time , but must always be flying off to something new .
Parsing [sent. 29 len. 18]: That disastrous marriage was like a millstone round his neck , and practically doomed him to failure .
Parsing [sent. 30 len. 11]: Oh , I know what you are going to say .
Parsing [sent. 31 len. 56]: There was nothing against Elma ; and you admired her , of course , because she was pretty and helpless ; but I shall always maintain that it was practically suicide for Edgar , with his Bohemian nature , to many a penniless girl , with no influence to help him on in the world .
Parsing [sent. 32 len. 13]: How they have managed to live at all I ca n't imagine .
Parsing [sent. 33 len. 15]: He never confided in me , and I made a point of not inquiring .
Parsing [sent. 34 len. 28]: To tell the truth , I lived in dread of his wanting to borrow money , and one has enough to do with one 's own claims .
Parsing [sent. 35 len. 25]: I think he was offended because we never invited the children , for I have scarcely heard from him for the last five years .
Parsing [sent. 36 len. 31]: Really , it was too great an experiment I ca n't imagine what they must be like , brought up in that little village , with next to no education .
Parsing [sent. 37 len. 8]: Social savages , I should say . ''
Parsing [sent. 38 len. 7]: `` How many children were there ?
Parsing [sent. 39 len. 11]: I 've forgotten how they come after the first two .
Parsing [sent. 40 len. 36]: Stephen and Philippa visited us once long ago , and I remember thinking her an uncommonly handsome child , with a spirit of her own , which will probably stand her in good stead now .
Parsing [sent. 41 len. 7]: The boy was not so interesting .
Parsing [sent. 42 len. 9]: How many are there besides these two ? ''
Parsing [sent. 43 len. 8]: `` Oh , I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 44 len. 2]: Dozens !
Parsing [sent. 45 len. 15]: There was always a baby , I remember , '' returned Mrs Loftus impatiently .
Parsing [sent. 46 len. 23]: `` Goodness knows what is to become of them now that they are left orphans , with practically no means of support .
Parsing [sent. 47 len. 8]: Stephen seems quite bewildered with the responsibility .
Parsing [sent. 48 len. 26]: He says he is anxious to see us , as his father 's nearest relations , and to consult with us as to the future .
Parsing [sent. 49 len. 9]: I think we had better decline all responsibility .
Parsing [sent. 50 len. 20]: It is a thankless task to interfere with other people 's business , and young folks are so opinionated .
Parsing [sent. 51 len. 33]: I shall write a letter of sympathy , and say that , as I know so little of their circumstances and surroundings , I do not feel myself competent to advise . ''
Parsing [sent. 52 len. 17]: `` Just as you please , my dear ; but you must speak for yourself alone .
Parsing [sent. 53 len. 12]: I shall certainly have a chat with the poor young fellow .
Parsing [sent. 54 len. 50]: It is the least we can do , and I am only sorry I was not back in time to attend the funeral I am afraid we behaved shabbily to poor Edgar while he was alive , and I should have liked to pay him some respect in death .
Parsing [sent. 55 len. 4]: This is Monday .
Parsing [sent. 56 len. 31]: I must attend to one or two affairs here , but I 'll run down to Leabourne towards the end of the week , and put up at the inn .
Parsing [sent. 57 len. 16]: Tell Stephen I 'll write later on and say when he may expect me . ''
Parsing [sent. 58 len. 18]: Mr Loftus pushed his chair back from the table , and tossed his serviette on a chair .
Parsing [sent. 59 len. 17]: He looked decidedly ruffled in temper , and injured and sorry for himself into the bargain .
Parsing [sent. 60 len. 26]: If there was one thing he disliked more than another , it was to have anything approaching a dissension with the members of his household .
Parsing [sent. 61 len. 59]: `` Peace at all price '' had been the motto of a character kindly enough , yet lacking the necessary strength to make a stand for the right , and already he was beginning to doubt his own wisdom , and to reflect sorrowfully how much less trouble it would have involved to have taken Gertrude 's advice .
Parsing [sent. 62 len. 41]: Half-way down the table he stopped short , with a sudden softening of the face , and laid his hands caressingly on the shoulders of a pale , languid-looking girl who had been a passive listener to the late conversation .
Parsing [sent. 63 len. 16]: `` You had better write too , and sympathise with your poor cousins , Avice .
Parsing [sent. 64 len. 22]: You would n't like it , would you , if _ you _ were to lose your poor old father ? ''
Parsing [sent. 65 len. 34]: The girl smiled at him affectionately enough , but made no response until the door had closed , when she turned to her mother with an expression of real anxiety upon her face .
Parsing [sent. 66 len. 10]: `` Shall I have to wear mourning , mother !
Parsing [sent. 67 len. 6]: Will it be necessary ? ''
Parsing [sent. 68 len. 4]: `` Cer-tainly not !
Parsing [sent. 69 len. 9]: I should not dream of such a thing .
Parsing [sent. 70 len. 33]: It is quite out of fashion nowadays for any but the nearest relations , and it would be a sin to put aside all those lovely French frocks until they were out-of-date .
Parsing [sent. 71 len. 28]: It would be different if we lived in the same place ; but you are not in the least likely to come in contact with your cousins .
Parsing [sent. 72 len. 32]: I ca n't think what has made your father take up this attitude all of a sudden ; but if he insists upon going to Leabourne I shall certainly go too .
Parsing [sent. 73 len. 25]: He is so carried away by the impulse of the moment that there is no knowing to what mad plan he might commit himself .
Parsing [sent. 74 len. 25]: The best thing your cousins can do will be to stay quietly where they are and take in paying guests to make ends meet .
Parsing [sent. 75 len. 23]: Quite good people do that nowadays ; and with so many girls they would not need much extra service in the house .
Parsing [sent. 76 len. 24]: From what Stephen says , I fear they have some notion of coming up to town , but that I shall strongly denounce .
Parsing [sent. 77 len. 12]: Most rash and improvident for them , and uncomfortable for us .
Parsing [sent. 78 len. 38]: They would , no doubt , expect us to take them up and introduce them to our friends , and would be offended when they discovered that we had no intention of doing anything of the kind .
Parsing [sent. 79 len. 14]: Much better stay where they are and work among their old friends . ''
Parsing [sent. 80 len. 9]: `` I should like to see Philippa again .
Parsing [sent. 81 len. 16]: It 's an age since she was here , but I remember her quite well .
Parsing [sent. 82 len. 7]: She was so lively and amusing !
Parsing [sent. 83 len. 16]: And there is another girl just my age , with a pretty , uncommon name .
Parsing [sent. 84 len. 5]: Faith , is it ?
Parsing [sent. 85 len. 4]: No ; Hope .
Parsing [sent. 86 len. 21]: Uncle Edgar sent me a little sketch of her on my birthday years ago , and it was so pretty !
Parsing [sent. 87 len. 16]: I 'd rather like to know my cousins , mother , if they were presentable .
Parsing [sent. 88 len. 10]: It 's so lonely being an only child . ''
Parsing [sent. 89 len. 20]: Mrs Loftus looked at her daughter , and something like a quiver passed across the hardness of her face .
Parsing [sent. 90 len. 54]: Avice was her darling , her idol , the only creature on earth whom she really loved ; and every now and again a spasm of alarm gripped her heart as she noted the languid speech and movement , the fragile form , and pallid complexion which distinguished the girl from her companions .
Parsing [sent. 91 len. 44]: Everything within the power of love and money had been done to make her strong and happy , yet she continued listless and ailing , seeming to regard the very amusements provided for her as so many penalties to be endured with resignation .
Parsing [sent. 92 len. 21]: Something must be wrong -- and very wrong -- to make a girl of twenty-one assume so unnatural an attitude .
Parsing [sent. 93 len. 24]: The mother checked a sigh half-way , and said caressingly : `` There is no reason for you to be dull , dearest .
Parsing [sent. 94 len. 12]: I am always ready to invite any one you may fancy .
Parsing [sent. 95 len. 13]: Surely , with all your friends , you need not be alone .
Parsing [sent. 96 len. 5]: What about Truda Bennett !
Parsing [sent. 97 len. 25]: If you like liveliness you could hardly improve upon her ; and The Knoll is a nice house for you to visit in return .
Parsing [sent. 98 len. 12]: Shall I write and ask her to come next week ! ''
Parsing [sent. 99 len. 23]: `` No , thank you , dear , I 'd rather not Truda is very nice , but she tires me out .
Parsing [sent. 100 len. 15]: She dislikes being quiet , and cares only for rushing about all day long .
Parsing [sent. 101 len. 16]: She does n't amuse _ me _ ; I have to amuse _ her _ .
Parsing [sent. 102 len. 22]: The nice thing about relations would be that one would not have to be on ceremony with them all the time .
Parsing [sent. 103 len. 35]: Could n't I go down with you to Leabourne next week , mother , and see what the girls were like , and if I should care to invite one of them here . ''
Parsing [sent. 104 len. 19]: `` You could , of course ; but I strongly advise you to do nothing of the sort .
Parsing [sent. 105 len. 34]: Your uncle Edgar has been dead only a fortnight , remember , and though I do n't think he was an especially devoted father , the children will naturally be upset and distressed .
Parsing [sent. 106 len. 31]: It would be very dull for you with the girls weeping , and your father and Stephen discussing money matters , and ten to one a dreary , uncomfortable inn .
Parsing [sent. 107 len. 13]: Better stay at home , and let me bring back a report .
Parsing [sent. 108 len. 32]: In any case you wo n't care to invite one of them here until the first few months are over and she is able to go about and make herself agreeable .
Parsing [sent. 109 len. 15]: It would be depressing to have her about in her first deep black . ''
Parsing [sent. 110 len. 6]: `` Oh dear , yes !
Parsing [sent. 111 len. 6]: I could n't stand that .
Parsing [sent. 112 len. 37]: I 'd rather be alone than have any one in low spirits , '' agreed Avice fervently , the idea that she herself might possibly help to cheer and console never dawning on her self-engrossed brain .
Parsing [sent. 113 len. 23]: `` You say that the girls must be savages , mother , but I should think they can hardly help being interesting .
Parsing [sent. 114 len. 27]: Aunt Elma was a beauty , and Uncle Edgar was a genius -- and some of them , at least , must have inherited his gifts .
Parsing [sent. 115 len. 11]: Why do you say he was not a devoted father ?
Parsing [sent. 116 len. 13]: From my vague recollection he seemed very proud of the children . ''
Parsing [sent. 117 len. 40]: `` Oh yes , he was proud enough ; but they worried him when they were young , and as they grew older I think he felt that they criticised him and realised how he had wasted his opportunities .
Parsing [sent. 118 len. 26]: He was devoted to Elma , for she worshipped him meekly all her life , and was convinced that no such genius had ever existed .
Parsing [sent. 119 len. 5]: Your father is right .
Parsing [sent. 120 len. 24]: I never knew a more brilliant young man than Edgar was at twenty-one ; but what is there to show for it now ?
Parsing [sent. 121 len. 28]: A few songs , two or three novels and volumes of poetry , and a number of pictures and sketches which he was ashamed even to sign !
Parsing [sent. 122 len. 25]: He was always growing discouraged , turning from one thing to another , and lowering his standard to meet the taste of the market .
Parsing [sent. 123 len. 27]: His songs became more and more clap-trap and commonplace , his stories more sensational , his pictures of the cheaply-pretty order which sell at provincial exhibitions .
Parsing [sent. 124 len. 38]: I believe at the bottom of his heart he realised his downfall , and when Elma died , and he had not her adoring admiration to keep up his faith in himself , he fretted himself ill .
Parsing [sent. 125 len. 33]: The last time I saw him he was a wreck -- mentally and physically -- and I fancy those girls must have had a trying time of it before the end . ''
Parsing [sent. 126 len. 3]: CHAPTER TWO .
Parsing [sent. 127 len. 4]: STEPHEN 'S CONFESSION .
Parsing [sent. 128 len. 40]: Stephen Charrington had expressed a wish to consult with his aunt and uncle less from any preconceived intention than from a feeling of helplessness which took possession of him as he penned the news of his father 's death .
Parsing [sent. 129 len. 57]: It had seemed to him at the moment that the advice of any one older and wiser than himself would be of value in deciding plans for the future , but no sooner was the letter irretrievably on its way than he began to tremble at the prospect of telling Philippa of what he had done .
Parsing [sent. 130 len. 24]: Philippa had been left co-trustee with himself , and she was not a young woman who would meekly be put on one side .
Parsing [sent. 131 len. 35]: What she thought , she said ; what she willed , she accomplished ; and anything like interference was to her as the brandishing of a red rag in the face of a bull .
Parsing [sent. 132 len. 42]: Stephen resolved to wait for a favourable opportunity before breaking the news of the intended visit , and to introduce it casually in the midst of a general conversation , when there would be less chance of a `` scene . ''
Parsing [sent. 133 len. 47]: On Tuesday he decided to speak on Wednesday ; on Wednesday there seemed abundant reason why he should postpone the disclosure until Thursday ; on Thursday his uncle 's note arrived announcing his arrival on the following day , and there could be no longer delay .
Parsing [sent. 134 len. 25]: Stephen betook himself to the morning-room , where his sisters sat in conclave , and hid himself behind a newspaper , awaiting his opportunity .
Parsing [sent. 135 len. 25]: Despite the gloominess of the autumn day and the mournful nature of the work on hand , the scene was far from being doleful .
Parsing [sent. 136 len. 50]: To begin with , the background was pretty -- a long , low apartment , half studio , half workroom , its walls washed a rich crimson hue , and covered with unmounted sketches , plaster casts on brackets , and a hundred quaint , artistic odds and ends .
Parsing [sent. 137 len. 20]: Against this background the four sisters made an interesting group as they busied themselves with the sewing on hand .
Parsing [sent. 138 len. 60]: There was no money forthcoming to pay dressmaking bills , and little enough to buy material , so it was necessary to use up what was in the house -- to turn and twist and remake , and cover over , and patch together -- an occupation which involved no little ingenuity in addition to the mere manual labour .
Parsing [sent. 139 len. 48]: Philippa stood by the table , the big cutting-out scissors in her hands ; a handsome girl with clearly cut aquiline features , and dark hair which rippled back in a soft , smoke-like mass , and was coiled gracefully together on the nape of her neck .
Parsing [sent. 140 len. 32]: Her shoulders were broad and square , and had a trick of broadening still further in dignified , self-assertive fashion when their owner was annoyed or wished to exercise her authority .
Parsing [sent. 141 len. 44]: Madge always declared that she looked at Philippa 's shoulders when she wished to see how the wind blew ; but then Madge was so daring and inconsequent in her remarks that no one paid much attention to what _ she _ said !
Parsing [sent. 142 len. 26]: Behold her now , running seams on the old-fashioned treadle machine , with bent back and long , pointed chin poked forward over the needle .
Parsing [sent. 143 len. 57]: As often as not a jerk of the hands or an erratic movement of the feet would be followed by a jar , a knot , a breaking of the thread ; and when this occurred Madge would clench both fists together and mouth dumb anathemas , the while she rolled tragic eyes to the ceiling .
Parsing [sent. 144 len. 45]: If there was one thing on earth which she detested more than another , it was plain sewing ; but this morning she had gallantly volunteered to do the machining , and machine she would , no matter what tortures it might cost her !
Parsing [sent. 145 len. 40]: She was a little scrap of a thin , starved-looking creature , with a long , narrow face , plain features , and just the prettiest , happiest , most lovable pair of hazel eyes you can possibly imagine .
Parsing [sent. 146 len. 25]: Even to-day they looked happy , for there was a certain transparency and twinkling light in the iris which seemed independent of varying moods .
Parsing [sent. 147 len. 73]: Madge was eighteen , and was going to be an artist and have pictures hung on the line in the Academy or know the reason why , and in her opinion her time would have been much more profitably employed daubing in the attic than doing dull , useful work downstairs ; but , as has been said , there are occasions when personal inclinations have to be laid in the dust .
Parsing [sent. 148 len. 22]: Theo sat by herself , unpicking a coloured lining from a black grenadine dress , with an expression of tragic despair .
Parsing [sent. 149 len. 44]: It was not that she sorrowed for her father more deeply than her sisters , but it was Theo 's nature to revel in emotion and deliberately to work herself up to the height of rejoicing or down to the depths of despair .
Parsing [sent. 150 len. 43]: She was a tall , graceful girl , with a face which was decidedly interesting if not regularly pretty , and her broad forehead and deep-set eyes seemed to portray a greater brain-power than that possessed by the rest of the family .
Parsing [sent. 151 len. 34]: Theo had written stories for her own amusement since the age of ten , and was even now engaged upon a full-fledged novel with which she hoped to burst upon an astonished world .
Parsing [sent. 152 len. 60]: It seemed a horrible , ghoul-like proceeding to examine her own feelings in order to be able to depict what Veronica , her heroine , should feel in the hour of her desolation ; and she was disgusted with herself because , despite all resolutions , she had been mentally taking notes during the whole of the past week .
Parsing [sent. 153 len. 46]: Now , as she sat unpicking the pretty pink lining and casting it ruthlessly on one side , her busy brain was weaving a simile by which it appeared that all the brightness of life was left behind and nothing remained but blackness and desolation .
Parsing [sent. 154 len. 31]: By Philippa 's side -- adviser , assistant , and architect-in-chief -- stood golden-haired Hope , sweet as her name , and all unselfish anxiety for the good of others .
Parsing [sent. 155 len. 53]: Her white forehead was wrinkled with the strain of trying to induce two yards of silk to do duty for three , and she stood at attention , staring down at the pattern spread over the black folds , and rubbing her chin in solemn calculation as she discussed the knotty point .
Parsing [sent. 156 len. 31]: `` If I were to make the yoke of something else , and let the silk come from the arm-holes only , do you think we could manage it then ?
Parsing [sent. 157 len. 26]: There is some of that old black velvet that could be used for the yoke , and it could be made to look very nice .
Parsing [sent. 158 len. 15]: I am afraid we could n't match this silk even if we tried . ''
Parsing [sent. 159 len. 12]: `` Do n't want to try , '' said Philippa shortly .
Parsing [sent. 160 len. 8]: `` Spent quite enough as it is .
Parsing [sent. 161 len. 23]: Well , we shall either have to do it that way or make the sleeves of another material to match the skirt .
Parsing [sent. 162 len. 8]: -- Theo , it 's for you .
Parsing [sent. 163 len. 7]: Which would you rather have ? ''
Parsing [sent. 164 len. 7]: `` Do n't care at all .
Parsing [sent. 165 len. 44]: Make it as you please ; I take no interest in the matter , '' replied Theo , turning her head elaborately in an opposite direction and speaking in a tone of implied rebuke , which brought a flash into Philippa 's eyes .
Parsing [sent. 166 len. 11]: `` Then you _ ought _ to take an interest !
Parsing [sent. 167 len. 15]: How are we to get on if no one will say what she wants ?
Parsing [sent. 168 len. 29]: We want to do our best for you , and it 's not much trouble just to say what you like , and help us to decide . ''
Parsing [sent. 169 len. 9]: Theo looked round at that , and lo !
Parsing [sent. 170 len. 7]: her eyes were full of tears .
Parsing [sent. 171 len. 18]: `` I think it 's hateful to think of clothes at all , '' she cried passionately .
Parsing [sent. 172 len. 12]: `` What does it matter _ how _ they are made ?
Parsing [sent. 173 len. 17]: Make me a sack if you like ; it will make no difference to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 174 len. 13]: `` Yes , dear , it will ; you are mistaken there .
Parsing [sent. 175 len. 32]: We shall have to wear these things for a long time , and the day will come when it would worry you very much to wear what you did not like .
Parsing [sent. 176 len. 54]: I know you feel no interest just now , but it would be really unselfish to rouse yourself enough to consider the question and help us with our work , '' said Hope , the peacemaker , speaking just in time to stop Philippa 's sharp retort and so avert the threatened storm .
Parsing [sent. 177 len. 30]: Theo , the emotional , was always ready to be swayed by a soft word ; besides , she adored Hope , and was especially sensitive to her wishes .
Parsing [sent. 178 len. 27]: So the black skirt was dropped to the floor , and she came forward obediently to discuss the important question of sleeves _ versus _ yokes .
Parsing [sent. 179 len. 27]: It was wonderful how particular she became when once her attention was aroused , and what precise instructions she had to give concerning shape and size .
Parsing [sent. 180 len. 48]: Madge dropped her chin until it looked longer than ever , and exchanged a sly glance with Philippa ; for if the two middle girls paired together , the eldest and youngest had a wonderful sympathy of feeling , and rarely failed to understand an unspoken message .
Parsing [sent. 181 len. 19]: `` Very well , then ; _ that 's _ settled , '' said Theo , in conclusion .
Parsing [sent. 182 len. 45]: `` And when it is done you need n't trouble to make anything more for me , for if there is any chance of going to London before winter I would rather wait and get what I want when we can shop in comfort .
Parsing [sent. 183 len. 23]: Did you see Mr Matthews to-day , Stephen , and tell him that this house might be to let at Michaelmas ? ''
Parsing [sent. 184 len. 3]: Poor Stephen !
Parsing [sent. 185 len. 13]: He quaked behind his newspaper , knowing that his hour had come .
Parsing [sent. 186 len. 33]: `` No-o , not to-day , '' he said feebly ; and then Madge must needs fall upon him in her turn , and cry : `` Oh Steve , how foolish !
Parsing [sent. 187 len. 37]: We told you he was looking at the Masons ' house last week , and if you put off seeing him he may take it before he knows there is a chance of getting this one .
Parsing [sent. 188 len. 6]: You really must go to-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 189 len. 16]: If we let him slip , goodness knows when we may find another tenant . ''
Parsing [sent. 190 len. 12]: Stephen put down the newspaper and braced himself for the fray .
Parsing [sent. 191 len. 29]: After all , he was the eldest of the family , the man and master , and it was cowardice to shrink from what a girl might say !
Parsing [sent. 192 len. 15]: `` I ca n't see him to-morrow , for I shall be otherwise engaged .
Parsing [sent. 193 len. 35]: I have had a letter from Uncle Loftus to say that he and Aunt Gertrude are coming down to-morrow to talk over arrangements with us and give us their advice as to the future .
Parsing [sent. 194 len. 36]: When I wrote to them last week I said I should be grateful if they would help us in this way , and it is good of them to come so far on our account .
Parsing [sent. 195 len. 5]: Uncle writes most kindly .
Parsing [sent. 196 len. 5]: He seems really interested .
Parsing [sent. 197 len. 10]: I think we have misjudged him in the past .
Parsing [sent. 198 len. 23]: At any rate , his wife was father 's nearest relative , and it seemed right that they should be consulted . ''
Parsing [sent. 199 len. 2]: Silence .
Parsing [sent. 200 len. 33]: The three girls looked fearfully at Philippa , and Philippa studied _ her _ pattern with an air of elaborate carelessness , making dainty snicks at the silk with the cutting-out scissors .
Parsing [sent. 201 len. 17]: `` And for how long , may I ask , have you invited them to stay ?
Parsing [sent. 202 len. 31]: It may be necessary to make a few preparations , and as the house is hardly in a state to receive visitors , we had better begin at once . ''
Parsing [sent. 203 len. 16]: `` They are not coming here ; they are to put up at the inn .
Parsing [sent. 204 len. 6]: Now , Phil , come !
Parsing [sent. 205 len. 7]: do n't take it like that .
Parsing [sent. 206 len. 12]: Honestly , I never intended to do anything behind your back .
Parsing [sent. 207 len. 28]: I was so worried and puzzled when I wrote that I said on the impulse of the moment that I wished they would give us their help .
Parsing [sent. 208 len. 23]: I did not tell you about it , for , to tell the truth , I never expected that they would come .
Parsing [sent. 209 len. 29]: Surely you feel , as I do , that we are ignorant and inexperienced , and would be the better for advice from people who know the world .
Parsing [sent. 210 len. 13]: You are a sensible girl ; I am sure you agree . ''
Parsing [sent. 211 len. 38]: `` I do n't think it is a question of understanding the world so much as understanding _ us _ and our circumstances , '' said Philippa , standing up suddenly and facing him with kindling eyes .
Parsing [sent. 212 len. 35]: She seemed about to add something sharp and stinging , but controlled herself with a visible effort , and said quietly , `` You should not have done this without consulting me , Steve .
Parsing [sent. 213 len. 13]: If we have to work together there must be confidence between us .
Parsing [sent. 214 len. 5]: But let that pass .
Parsing [sent. 215 len. 9]: I do n't want to make unnecessary difficulties .
Parsing [sent. 216 len. 10]: We have enough as it is , goodness knows !
Parsing [sent. 217 len. 48]: I should welcome any advice that came from a reliable source , but the Loftus connection have shown so plainly of late years that they wished to have nothing to do with us , that I ca n't say their opinion will have any weight with me .
Parsing [sent. 218 len. 16]: They are selfish , worldly creatures , who only think of their own convenience . ''
Parsing [sent. 219 len. 14]: `` Even so , my dear , they may be useful to us .
Parsing [sent. 220 len. 19]: Worldly wisdom is an ingredient which has been conspicuous by its absence in our family up till now .
Parsing [sent. 221 len. 68]: It is time we made a reform , '' said Steve , with a tinge of bitterness in his voice ; for it is a heavy burden for a young fellow of twenty-five to find himself saddled with the responsibility of an impecunious young family , and it was difficult to subdue a feeling of resentment as he remembered the careless _ regime _ of the past .
Parsing [sent. 222 len. 48]: `` When it comes to the final decision you and I must give the casting votes , but it would be an ease to my mind , at least , if a man of the world like Uncle Loftus approved of what we were going to do .
Parsing [sent. 223 len. 5]: Come now , Phil !
Parsing [sent. 224 len. 6]: it would to you too .
Parsing [sent. 225 len. 32]: If the worst came to the worst , and our venture proved a failure , it would be a comfort to you to feel that you had not acted alone . ''
Parsing [sent. 226 len. 16]: `` I do n't think anything could comfort me then , '' said Philippa sadly .
Parsing [sent. 227 len. 15]: She leant against the table and snapped unconsciously at the air with the scissors .
Parsing [sent. 228 len. 31]: `` If it will be any satisfaction to you , Steve , I am glad that they are coming ; but , honestly , they wo n't alter my decision .
Parsing [sent. 229 len. 28]: I have thought and thought until my brain feels like a jelly , but there seems no way out of the tangle but the one we propose .
Parsing [sent. 230 len. 28]: If Uncle Loftus tries to dissuade me , I shall be obliged to tell him that in this matter I consider my own judgment better than his .
Parsing [sent. 231 len. 10]: How can he decide what is best for us ?
Parsing [sent. 232 len. 10]: What does he know of our characters and possibilities ?
Parsing [sent. 233 len. 7]: We are not like other families .
Parsing [sent. 234 len. 18]: We may be less amiable and worthy in many respects , but we _ are _ cleverer .
Parsing [sent. 235 len. 13]: It is n't conceited to say so , for it 's true .
Parsing [sent. 236 len. 19]: We have inherited father 's gifts , and ought to be able to do something with our lives .
Parsing [sent. 237 len. 53]: Other girls might be content to stodge along and never see anything of the world , and teach the doctor 's children , and marry the curates , and be as poor as Job all their lives , but -- '' '' ` But that 's not me nor you ! ' ''
Parsing [sent. 238 len. 25]: quoted Madge vigorously , stopping the machine with the usual jar and snap , and tossing her determined chin with an air of defiance .
Parsing [sent. 239 len. 9]: `` I wo n't stodge for any one .
Parsing [sent. 240 len. 68]: If fifty aunts and a hundred uncles came and sat in rows round the room , and besought me to be a good little girl and stay where I was , I 'd snap my fingers in their faces and tell them that I had to live my own life , and I 'd take jolly good care that I lived it in my own way . ''
Parsing [sent. 241 len. 4]: `` Madge ! ''
Parsing [sent. 242 len. 3]: `` Sorry !
Parsing [sent. 243 len. 6]: Did n't mean to interfere .
Parsing [sent. 244 len. 13]: Thought you might like to know my sentiments -- that 's all .
Parsing [sent. 245 len. 21]: Keep me out of the room when the Loftuses are here if you do n't wish them to hear home-truths .
Parsing [sent. 246 len. 56]: I do n't mince my words when I 'm roused , as some of you know to your cost I 'll shake hands with them when they come , and say good-bye when they go , and they will say to each other as they drive away , ` Plain , heavy-looking girl that youngest !
Parsing [sent. 247 len. 12]: They will never be able to do anything with her . '
Parsing [sent. 248 len. 5]: Ha , ha ! ''
Parsing [sent. 249 len. 25]: and Madge laughed in a mocking , derisive fashion , which brought an answering flicker of amusement to the anxious faces of her companions .
Parsing [sent. 250 len. 60]: It was evident that she fully expected an hour to come when her relatives would be stupefied to discover the genius of the age in the `` plain , heavy-looking girl '' whom they had despised , and it said volumes for her attainments that the prospect seemed within range of possibility to more than one of her audience .
Parsing [sent. 251 len. 10]: Theo , however , had an objection to make .
Parsing [sent. 252 len. 20]: `` I think you are very foolish if you do anything of the kind , '' she said severely .
Parsing [sent. 253 len. 24]: `` We ought to make the best of ourselves , not the worst , if we want them to agree to our plan .
Parsing [sent. 254 len. 42]: They know that we are poor and have lived in the country all our lives , and I suppose they imagine that we are great , awkward , clownish creatures who know nothing about society or how things should be done .
Parsing [sent. 255 len. 6]: I vote we surprise them .
Parsing [sent. 256 len. 57]: Let 's all put on our nicest things , and make the house look its very , very best , and prepare a _ chic _ little luncheon , and give them coffee afterwards ; and let them see that we do n't require any patronage , and are quite able to take care of ourselves .
Parsing [sent. 257 len. 16]: I 'm sure that 's the best plan ; is n't it , Phil ? ''
Parsing [sent. 258 len. 10]: `` I do n't know , I 'm sure .
Parsing [sent. 259 len. 5]: Go your own ways .
Parsing [sent. 260 len. 15]: You want to appear better than you are ; Madge wants to appear worse .
Parsing [sent. 261 len. 10]: I 'm going to be myself -- horribly myself !
Parsing [sent. 262 len. 11]: I do n't feel that I can pretend one bit .
Parsing [sent. 263 len. 16]: It 's all very well for you ; you are only standing on the ramparts .
Parsing [sent. 264 len. 31]: I have to go down and fight the battle , '' cried poor Philippa dismally , and Hope 's arm stole round her waist with a close , encouraging pressure .
Parsing [sent. 265 len. 20]: Hope was so sorry for every one in turn that she had no time to be sorry for herself .
Parsing [sent. 266 len. 12]: `` It will soon be over , '' she whispered fondly .
Parsing [sent. 267 len. 6]: `` Cheer up , Phil !
Parsing [sent. 268 len. 12]: By this time to-morrow they will have come and gone . ''
Parsing [sent. 269 len. 3]: CHAPTER THREE .
Parsing [sent. 270 len. 4]: A FAMILY CONCLAVE .
Parsing [sent. 271 len. 22]: Mr and Mrs Loftus arrived by the morning train , and drove up to The Cottage in the ancient village fly .
Parsing [sent. 272 len. 29]: Uncle Edward wore a black band round his hat ; Aunt Gertrude an elaborately trimmed black gown , which had obviously _ not _ been bought for mourning .
Parsing [sent. 273 len. 30]: They stared curiously at the house as they approached , and from behind the blind in the front bedroom four pairs of eyes stared even more curiously at them .
Parsing [sent. 274 len. 8]: `` Thin lips and a sharp nose !
Parsing [sent. 275 len. 5]: Face like a hatchet .
Parsing [sent. 276 len. 12]: No love lost between _ us _ , my dear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 277 len. 4]: cried Madge shrewdly .
Parsing [sent. 278 len. 8]: `` Nice old fellow , Uncle Edward !
Parsing [sent. 279 len. 14]: Looks as if he would be kind if he had the chance . ''
Parsing [sent. 280 len. 6]: `` Is n't she smart ?
Parsing [sent. 281 len. 19]: She has taken the flowers out of an ordinary bonnet to make us think she is in mourning .
Parsing [sent. 282 len. 33]: I could swear there were once pink roses where that jet is now , '' said Theo of the sharp eyes , the while she glanced complacently at her own careful toilet .
Parsing [sent. 283 len. 10]: `` I am glad I dressed up the drawing-room .
Parsing [sent. 284 len. 7]: Do n't hurry down , Phil .
Parsing [sent. 285 len. 19]: Let them have time to look round and realise that we do n't live in a hovel . ''
Parsing [sent. 286 len. 24]: `` I suppose I ought to fly to meet them at the door , but I do n't feel in the least inclined .
Parsing [sent. 287 len. 6]: Now Steve is going out .
Parsing [sent. 288 len. 5]: He looks so nervous !
Parsing [sent. 289 len. 11]: I 'm sure he wishes that he had not written .
Parsing [sent. 290 len. 12]: Do you think Aunt Gertrude looks more determined than I do ?
Parsing [sent. 291 len. 9]: I expect we shall have an awful battle .
Parsing [sent. 292 len. 16]: You must come down with me , girls , and be introduced before we begin .
Parsing [sent. 293 len. 21]: I wish my heart would n't thud ; I do n't want to give myself away by looking nervous . ''
Parsing [sent. 294 len. 43]: Then came a quick review before the glass , a creeping downstairs , and the entrance of four girls , one after the other , to greet the unknown relatives as they stood in the middle of the low , sunny-windowed drawing-room .
Parsing [sent. 295 len. 84]: Mrs Loftus put up her _ pince-nez _ and stared at each in turn -- Philippa , stately and dignified ; pretty , soft-eyed Hope ; Theo , with her air of distinction and clever , interesting face ; Madge of the long , sagacious chin and quick , light movements -- and even as she looked she realised that these were no nonentities , but young women who would insist upon having a definite vote in the matter of their own destiny .
Parsing [sent. 296 len. 71]: They sat down and talked company talk , the little handmaid appeared and offered light refreshments to the travellers , Uncle Loftus made complimentary remarks , and everything was quite proper and orthodox , just like a scene in a book , until presently Stephen began to fidget and glance at the clock , and Philippa looked at her uncle and said , `` Shall we have our talk now ?
Parsing [sent. 297 len. 30]: The girls will leave us alone for an hour , and Stephen will tell you exactly what our position is , and what we are thinking of doing . ''
Parsing [sent. 298 len. 8]: `` Perhaps it would be as well .
Parsing [sent. 299 len. 31]: I am feeling so tired after the journey that I should like to go to bed early this evening , and have ordered dinner at the inn at seven o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 300 len. 8]: I hope that is convenient to you .
Parsing [sent. 301 len. 22]: I did n't know what your arrangements might be , or whether it would be convenient to have us here . ''
Parsing [sent. 302 len. 5]: `` Whichever you prefer .
Parsing [sent. 303 len. 60]: We hoped you would spend the evening with us , but I can quite understand that you must be tired , '' said Philippa , resolutely avoiding meeting Theo 's eye lest she should be obliged to smile at the thought of the wasted culinary efforts over which that poor victim had been groaning the whole of the morning .
Parsing [sent. 304 len. 44]: Then the door closed , the two men automatically moved their chairs nearer the table , and Stephen nervously began his story : `` You know , of course , that my father was in bad health for some years before he died .
Parsing [sent. 305 len. 26]: His work was of the kind which was peculiarly dependent on health , for he had the artistic temperament and could do nothing to order .
Parsing [sent. 306 len. 15]: He was in chronic low spirits , and had not the energy to compose .
Parsing [sent. 307 len. 34]: In former years he made a very fair income ; though , of course , it was always uncertain , and he could never tell from month to month what would come in .
Parsing [sent. 308 len. 20]: Sometimes he made a hit , and one or two of his songs bring in a fair royalty still .
Parsing [sent. 309 len. 37]: He was able to save a little , now and again , but the last two years he was constantly having to draw on his capital , until we find that there is practically none left .
Parsing [sent. 310 len. 11]: There is , however , an insurance which is intact .
Parsing [sent. 311 len. 41]: It seems that on his marriage my mother 's people insisted on this as a provision for her in the event of his death ; and as the premiums were paid up some years ago , it has not lapsed .
Parsing [sent. 312 len. 40]: It amounts to two thousand pounds , and is left to Philippa and myself in trust for the family , with full discretion to use it as seems best to us for our mutual benefit and advancement in life .
Parsing [sent. 313 len. 7]: There are six of us altogether .
Parsing [sent. 314 len. 37]: My brother Barnard is still at school , but we have given notice for him to leave at the end of the term , as he is sixteen , and must begin to work for himself .
Parsing [sent. 315 len. 13]: Two thousand pounds is not a large provision for six people . ''
Parsing [sent. 316 len. 27]: Mrs Loftus drew in her lips and stared fixedly at a corner of the ceiling ; her husband drummed upon the table and looked unaffectedly distressed .
Parsing [sent. 317 len. 6]: `` So bad as that !
Parsing [sent. 318 len. 4]: Tut , tut !
Parsing [sent. 319 len. 8]: Sorry to hear it -- sorry indeed .
Parsing [sent. 320 len. 4]: And this house ?
Parsing [sent. 321 len. 12]: You have made it very pretty -- charming little bijou residence .
Parsing [sent. 322 len. 7]: Is the house your own ? ''
Parsing [sent. 323 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 324 len. 28]: We have it at a very low rental in consideration of the improvements which father made from time to time , but it is not our own .
Parsing [sent. 325 len. 24]: We think we should have no difficulty in letting it ; for , as you say , it is pretty in its way .
Parsing [sent. 326 len. 34]: In fact , we know of a possible tenant already , and I think it quite likely that he may take the lease from us at Michaelmas if we decide to move . ''
Parsing [sent. 327 len. 27]: There was a rustle of silken skirts as Mrs Loftus sat upright in her chair and gave a short preliminary cough before entering into the conversation .
Parsing [sent. 328 len. 15]: `` But if you get it cheaply , why should you move at all ?
Parsing [sent. 329 len. 9]: I think it would be a fatal mistake .
Parsing [sent. 330 len. 27]: Living must be very cheap in this out-of-the-world place ; and you have a garden , I see , which must keep you supplied with vegetables .
Parsing [sent. 331 len. 20]: If you kept fowls you might sell the eggs , and make a little extra money in that way .
Parsing [sent. 332 len. 13]: Quite a number of people go in for poultry-farming in these days .
Parsing [sent. 333 len. 7]: There is nothing _ infra dig .
Parsing [sent. 334 len. 4]: _ about it .
Parsing [sent. 335 len. 31]: I was saying to your uncle as we came down that it was quite likely that you could get paying guests if you went to work in the right way .
Parsing [sent. 336 len. 17]: Many people prefer living in the country in summer-time , and you could quote reasonable terms .
Parsing [sent. 337 len. 26]: Then there must surely be some teaching to be found in the neighbourhood , which would employ the girls who were not needed at home .
Parsing [sent. 338 len. 37]: Really I think , with a hundred a year assured , besides what you earn -- you are in a solicitor 's office , I believe , Stephen -- you might get along very comfortably . ''
Parsing [sent. 339 len. 36]: Philippa 's eyes flashed , but her lips twitched at the same time , for it was too absurd to hear a stranger settling the destinies of a family in this swift , casual fashion .
Parsing [sent. 340 len. 39]: She dared not meet Stephen 's eye ; and even Mr Loftus seemed conscious of something wrong , for he said testily : `` Not so quick , my dear ; not so quick , if you please !
Parsing [sent. 341 len. 14]: We have not heard what plans Stephen and Philippa have made for themselves .
Parsing [sent. 342 len. 27]: -- I should like to hear your own ideas ; for , of course , you have thought over the matter from all points of view .
Parsing [sent. 343 len. 9]: Let us hear what are your plans . ''
Parsing [sent. 344 len. 16]: The brother and sister looked at one another , and there was a dead silence .
Parsing [sent. 345 len. 6]: Stephen was afraid to speak .
Parsing [sent. 346 len. 11]: Philippa was anxious not to monopolise the role of leader .
Parsing [sent. 347 len. 18]: She waited a full moment , but when she began there was no hesitation in her voice .
Parsing [sent. 348 len. 13]: `` We intend to go up to London to seek our fortunes .
Parsing [sent. 349 len. 34]: I agree with Aunt Gertrude that if we stayed here we should be able to earn enough money to provide bread-and-butter , and for the time being it would be the easier course .
Parsing [sent. 350 len. 20]: But we do n't want to think of the present only ; we want to provide for the future .
Parsing [sent. 351 len. 27]: I believe -- and Stephen agrees with me -- that if we settle here now it will practically mean vegetating for the rest of our lives .
Parsing [sent. 352 len. 28]: He will remain in the same sleepy office , where if he worked for twenty years he could never gain more than a few hundreds a year .
Parsing [sent. 353 len. 10]: Barney would come home and go into the bank .
Parsing [sent. 354 len. 27]: There is no other place to put him , and he is too lively and high-spirited a boy to trust by himself in a big town .
Parsing [sent. 355 len. 6]: Then there are the girls .
Parsing [sent. 356 len. 14]: They are all clever , and father was very particular about their training .
Parsing [sent. 357 len. 31]: He realised that he himself had made a mistake in trying too many things at once , so he made them each choose one hobby and stick to that alone .
Parsing [sent. 358 len. 4]: Hope is musical .
Parsing [sent. 359 len. 21]: She plays charmingly , can read music as easily as a book , and has already had one song published .
Parsing [sent. 360 len. 18]: She ought to study harmony under a clever master , and hear plenty of really good music .
Parsing [sent. 361 len. 17]: Father said that that was what she wanted most of all -- to hear good music .
Parsing [sent. 362 len. 27]: She has gone through the drudgery ; what she needs now is confidence and style ; but it is impossible to give it to her here .
Parsing [sent. 363 len. 5]: Theo wishes to write .
Parsing [sent. 364 len. 15]: She is always scribbling , and father thought she would do well some day .
Parsing [sent. 365 len. 24]: There are one or two editors in London who knew him , and who would take an interest in her for his sake .
Parsing [sent. 366 len. 12]: She has a narrow life here , with very few friends .
Parsing [sent. 367 len. 14]: It would be the best training for her to have more varied experience .
Parsing [sent. 368 len. 5]: Madge is an artist .
Parsing [sent. 369 len. 15]: It is her ambition in life to go to a studio and work hard .
Parsing [sent. 370 len. 16]: She is very original , and has already quite a distinctive style of her own .
Parsing [sent. 371 len. 19]: Father was very proud of her , and used to say she was the cleverest of the family .
Parsing [sent. 372 len. 19]: Now that he is gone there is no one within miles who can help her with her work .
Parsing [sent. 373 len. 26]: It seems to me a very sad thing to turn these girls into governesses and household drudges when they have real gifts to cultivate . ''
Parsing [sent. 374 len. 7]: `` Quite so -- quite so .
Parsing [sent. 375 len. 31]: I can understand your feelings ; but you must n't be angry with me , my dear , if I say that you must allow some discount for sisterly partiality .
Parsing [sent. 376 len. 21]: You think your sisters geniuses , but whether the public will agree with you is a very different question . ''
Parsing [sent. 377 len. 39]: Uncle Loftus was beginning to feel vaguely uncomfortable , and to scent a coming request for a loan of money , to be repaid at that indefinite period when the aforesaid geniuses should be recognised by the world .
Parsing [sent. 378 len. 60]: He was a good-natured man , and was quite ready to help these pretty , attractive nieces by an occasional present of a dress or a five-pound note ; but his recollection of school bills paid for his own daughter made him shrink from the prospect of finishing the education of three ambitious and aspiring young `` women . ''
Parsing [sent. 379 len. 26]: `` Music and pictures are at a discount in these hard times , and half the artists , by their own account , are starving .
Parsing [sent. 380 len. 13]: A poor fellow brought me a couple of water-colours only last month .
Parsing [sent. 381 len. 13]: Wanted fifteen pounds for them , but was thankful to take five .
Parsing [sent. 382 len. 6]: Very good pictures , too !
Parsing [sent. 383 len. 18]: I do n't pretend to understand these things , but they look very well in my smoke-room .
Parsing [sent. 384 len. 30]: As for story-writing , there are half-a-dozen stars who make a fortune in literature , but the vast majority of authors have a hard fight to earn a living .
Parsing [sent. 385 len. 24]: Many of them fail altogether and throw it up in despair , like that poor poet fellow -- Chatterton , was n't it ?
Parsing [sent. 386 len. 6]: I never can remember names .
Parsing [sent. 387 len. 30]: Women are n't made to fight their way , especially country girls , as you are , who have no idea of life in a great world like London .
Parsing [sent. 388 len. 19]: Depend upon it , my dear , you would be far happier and safer where you are . ''
Parsing [sent. 389 len. 7]: `` For the present -- yes .
Parsing [sent. 390 len. 5]: I said so myself .
Parsing [sent. 391 len. 43]: If we go to town we shall have a hard fight for the first few years ; but we have faith to believe that we should succeed in the end , and we would rather fight our battles while we are young .
Parsing [sent. 392 len. 49]: If _ you _ were beginning life , Uncle Loftus , would you be content to settle down to lifelong obscurity and poverty , or would you feel that , come what might , you must go down into the arena and win a crown for yourself ? ''
Parsing [sent. 393 len. 13]: Philippa threw back her head and looked at him with challenging eyes .
Parsing [sent. 394 len. 48]: So young , so brave , so ignorant , poor child , of the real meaning of the fight which lay before her , what wonder that the man 's heart softened , and that he laid his hand on hers with a quick movement of sympathy .
Parsing [sent. 395 len. 22]: Mrs Loftus spied the movement with her cold blue eyes , and hastened to turn on the tap of cold common-sense .
Parsing [sent. 396 len. 20]: `` Perhaps you will kindly tell us in plain words exactly what it is that you intend to do .
Parsing [sent. 397 len. 21]: Your ideas sound very charming and romantic , but I do not understand how they are to be carried out .
Parsing [sent. 398 len. 18]: Education is a costly business , and it is your duty to save rather than to spend .
Parsing [sent. 399 len. 19]: How can you reconcile the need of earning money with the programme which you have drawn out ? ''
Parsing [sent. 400 len. 11]: `` I do n't try , '' said Philippa boldly .
Parsing [sent. 401 len. 7]: `` I know it is impossible .
Parsing [sent. 402 len. 69]: You will think our scheme very daring , Aunt Gertrude , but in plain words it is this : to take a flat in town in as central a position as we can afford , and to invest our capital in apprenticing Barney to a firm where he would have a chance of getting on , and in giving the girls the lessons and opportunities which they require .
Parsing [sent. 403 len. 50]: We know quite well that we could not possibly do this on our tiny income , but we believe that it is the wisest way of using our capital , and that the time will come when we shall be thankful that we had the courage to do it .
Parsing [sent. 404 len. 60]: Th-that 's all ; that 's our scheme , '' faltered Philippa , feeling that she had launched a bombshell , indeed , as her uncle fell back in his chair overcome with amazement , and her aunt raised protesting eyes to the ceiling as though calling Heaven to witness that she was no party to this mad folly .
Parsing [sent. 405 len. 16]: `` And -- er -- Stephen would , of course , give up his situation !
Parsing [sent. 406 len. 15]: He would -- er -- hope to find more lucrative employment in London ? ''
Parsing [sent. 407 len. 19]: she inquired , with a thinly veiled satire which roused the head of the family to dignified response .
Parsing [sent. 408 len. 9]: `` I have every reason to do so .
Parsing [sent. 409 len. 17]: In that respect at least we should not be reckoning in the dark , Aunt Gertrude .
Parsing [sent. 410 len. 35]: The solicitor 's office here is but a small branch of an important one in the City , and my chief has been anxious for some time that I should remove to the head-office .
Parsing [sent. 411 len. 28]: He realised that there could be no promotion for me here , and has been a most kind friend -- anxious to help us in every way .
Parsing [sent. 412 len. 27]: So far I have refused to move , for I like a country life , and -- '' `` He does n't like it a bit .
Parsing [sent. 413 len. 44]: He longs to go to town , but he stayed with us because he knew we could n't do without him , '' cried Philippa , with a loving glance , at which Stephen flushed and darkly scowled an order to be silent .
Parsing [sent. 414 len. 31]: Mr Loftus thought the byplay very pretty and creditable to both the actors , but his business instinct had been shocked , and he felt it his duty to protest .
Parsing [sent. 415 len. 5]: `` Spend your capital !
Parsing [sent. 416 len. 5]: Break into your capital !
Parsing [sent. 417 len. 14]: My dear girl , that is against all laws of prudence and business .
Parsing [sent. 418 len. 21]: I really -- as you have asked my advice -- I really could not sanction such a step as that .
Parsing [sent. 419 len. 20]: Your income , taking everything together , will not amount to over three hundred a year , I suppose ?
Parsing [sent. 420 len. 2]: No !
Parsing [sent. 421 len. 4]: I thought not .
Parsing [sent. 422 len. 60]: Well then , remember that you would have to pay a high London rent , to feed and clothe six people , exclusive of a servant , to pay coals and gas , and constant travelling to and fro , and a hundred extra expenses , before you begin to think of lessons and concert-going and payment of premiums .
Parsing [sent. 423 len. 21]: It would cost you at least twice as much , and I doubt if you could do it on that .
Parsing [sent. 424 len. 6]: Consider what you are doing .
Parsing [sent. 425 len. 19]: It is a risk which I could never sanction -- a big risk , a serious risk . ''
Parsing [sent. 426 len. 12]: `` I believe in risks , '' cried Philippa gallantly . ''
Parsing [sent. 427 len. 30]: ` There is a tide in the affairs of men ' -- Risk -- deliberate , thoughtful risk -- is only another name for courage and enterprise and faith .
Parsing [sent. 428 len. 16]: What would become of the world if no one was willing to take a risk ?
Parsing [sent. 429 len. 24]: What battle would be won if soldiers did not risk everything -- health , limbs , life itself -- to overcome the enemy !
Parsing [sent. 430 len. 27]: We know it is a risk ; we have faced it with our eyes open ; but we feel it is the right thing to do .
Parsing [sent. 431 len. 11]: It is our chance ; we ought to take it .
Parsing [sent. 432 len. 57]: We are not acting thoughtlessly or lightly ; we mean to work hard , and to ask God to help us and give us strength not to be discouraged -- '' `` We are not going to squander our capital , uncle , '' said Stephen ; `` we are going to _ invest _ it .
Parsing [sent. 433 len. 34]: Surely if you can equip six people with the means of getting on in the world , it is a better return for money than a wretched three and a half per cent .
Parsing [sent. 434 len. 38]: We mean to practise every possible economy in food and dress and amusements , and to be extravagant in one way only : the girls shall have no second-rate masters ; Barney shall have a good start .
Parsing [sent. 435 len. 29]: They realise the responsibility which we are taking upon ourselves , and are prepared to work hard and shorten the period of probation as much as possible . ''
Parsing [sent. 436 len. 8]: `` Yes , yes -- of course !
Parsing [sent. 437 len. 17]: Young things are always eager for change , and are ready to promise anything in advance .
Parsing [sent. 438 len. 11]: But suppose they _ do n't _ make their way ?
Parsing [sent. 439 len. 7]: Suppose your scheme is a failure ?
Parsing [sent. 440 len. 37]: The money is left to you and to Philippa to spend as you think wise for the good of the family , so that legally there would be no claim upon you for what was gone .
Parsing [sent. 441 len. 15]: But you might find yourself in a most unpleasant position , all the same .
Parsing [sent. 442 len. 30]: If you spend it all within the next few years , Barnard may think himself ill-used when he grows up and feels the need of a few hundred pounds .
Parsing [sent. 443 len. 35]: The girls may want a trifle to buy a trousseau , or help in other ways , and may blame you for influencing them when they were too young to know their own minds .
Parsing [sent. 444 len. 20]: Do you ever think , my dears , of what would happen if your scheme were to fail ? ''
Parsing [sent. 445 len. 5]: Did she ever think !
Parsing [sent. 446 len. 3]: Poor Philippa !
Parsing [sent. 447 len. 19]: How many scores -- nay , hundreds -- of times had the nightmare seized her in its grip !
Parsing [sent. 448 len. 32]: How often had she lain awake shuddering with dread , seeing the workhouse loom large in the foreground , and the reproachful faces of brothers and sisters turned mutely upon her !
Parsing [sent. 449 len. 33]: She shivered even now , and clasped her hands beneath the tablecloth ; but she showed a brave face to the enemy , and refused to be cast down in his presence .
Parsing [sent. 450 len. 17]: `` It is no use beginning a fight with the expectation of being beaten , uncle .
Parsing [sent. 451 len. 11]: I should have no courage left if I did that .
Parsing [sent. 452 len. 37]: I have enough faith in my brothers and sisters to believe that they will not reproach us , whatever happens ; and at the worst we could come back and try your plan in the country .
Parsing [sent. 453 len. 29]: We are strong and capable , and could always earn enough to live on , even if we had to separate and go out as cooks and housemaids .
Parsing [sent. 454 len. 10]: I am not in the least afraid of starving .
Parsing [sent. 455 len. 16]: We shall manage to keep ourselves without either asking or expecting help from outsiders . ''
Parsing [sent. 456 len. 8]: `` Come , come , my dear !
Parsing [sent. 457 len. 10]: there is such a thing as being too independent .
Parsing [sent. 458 len. 17]: What is the use of relations if they ca n't help each other at a pinch ?
Parsing [sent. 459 len. 17]: If you are really determined to try this scheme we must help you all we can .
Parsing [sent. 460 len. 23]: You must come to see us when we are in town , and we may be able to give you useful introductions .
Parsing [sent. 461 len. 15]: Avice will be pleased to make your acquaintance , and so shall we all .
Parsing [sent. 462 len. 19]: -- We must do what we can for Edgar 's children , must n't we , mamma ? ''
Parsing [sent. 463 len. 28]: `` I can not promise anything which would be an encouragement to what appears to me a piece of preposterous folly , '' said Mrs Loftus coldly .
Parsing [sent. 464 len. 22]: `` It is flying in the face of Providence to leave a comfortable home and deliberately court danger in this fashion .
Parsing [sent. 465 len. 25]: With your inexperience you will be ruined before a year is over , and who is to pay your debts I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 466 len. 17]: You ca n't expect any help from us if you act in defiance of our wishes .
Parsing [sent. 467 len. 42]: If you had already made up your minds , as appears to be the case , I must say it was very inconsiderate to inflict this long journey upon your uncle and myself for the mere farce of asking our opinion .
Parsing [sent. 468 len. 13]: -- We had better get back to the hotel now , Edward .
Parsing [sent. 469 len. 13]: I am tired , and shall be glad of a rest . ''
Parsing [sent. 470 len. 32]: Mr Loftus rose obediently and followed his wife 's lead to the door , but on his way he managed to whisper a few conciliatory words into Philippa 's burning ear .
Parsing [sent. 471 len. 11]: `` Take no notice , my dear -- no notice !
Parsing [sent. 472 len. 11]: Your aunt is hasty , but she will come round .
Parsing [sent. 473 len. 26]: I will see you again this evening when she has gone to bed , and to-morrow we will both come up again before we leave .
Parsing [sent. 474 len. 18]: Ca n't approve , you know -- ca n't approve ; but you are a brave girl .
Parsing [sent. 475 len. 4]: You mean well .
Parsing [sent. 476 len. 6]: Wish you good luck ! ''
Parsing [sent. 477 len. 13]: Philippa 's eyes swept over him with an expression of magnanimous superiority .
Parsing [sent. 478 len. 9]: `` Poor little down-trodden , trembling worm ! ''
Parsing [sent. 479 len. 6]: she was saying to herself .
Parsing [sent. 480 len. 19]: `` Afraid to assert yourself and be your natural self for fear of what a woman might say !
Parsing [sent. 481 len. 8]: Oh , if I were a man !
Parsing [sent. 482 len. 11]: Oh , if I were your husband , my dear !
Parsing [sent. 483 len. 20]: I 'd keep you in order ; I 'd tell you straight out what I thought of you . ''
Parsing [sent. 484 len. 9]: Then aloud : `` Good-afternoon , Aunt Gertrude !
Parsing [sent. 485 len. 4]: Mind the door-step .
Parsing [sent. 486 len. 3]: So awkward !
Parsing [sent. 487 len. 10]: _ Hope _ you will not be too tired .
Parsing [sent. 488 len. 5]: _ Good-bye _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 489 len. 21]: The door closed , and brother and sister drew back and gazed at one another with bright , excited eyes .
Parsing [sent. 490 len. 4]: `` Well ? ''
Parsing [sent. 491 len. 3]: queried one .
Parsing [sent. 492 len. 8]: `` Well , '' answered the other .
Parsing [sent. 493 len. 29]: Then came the rush of feet on the floor , and down hurried the girls , one after the other , questioning , staring , agape with curiosity .
Parsing [sent. 494 len. 12]: `` Well -- well -- well -- what did they say ?
Parsing [sent. 495 len. 4]: Were they furious ?
Parsing [sent. 496 len. 4]: Were they amiable ?
Parsing [sent. 497 len. 7]: Did you stick to your point ?
Parsing [sent. 498 len. 5]: Are they coming again ?
Parsing [sent. 499 len. 4]: What is decided ?
Parsing [sent. 500 len. 4]: Tell us quickly !
Parsing [sent. 501 len. 6]: Tell us at once ! ''
Parsing [sent. 502 len. 11]: `` It is quite decided , '' said Stephen gravely .
Parsing [sent. 503 len. 8]: `` We are going to London . ''
Parsing [sent. 504 len. 18]: He put his arm round his sister 's waist , and looked down at her with admiration .
Parsing [sent. 505 len. 7]: `` Phil , you were glorious !
Parsing [sent. 506 len. 16]: You convinced _ me _ , at least , if you failed with the others .
Parsing [sent. 507 len. 7]: My last lingering doubt has disappeared .
Parsing [sent. 508 len. 9]: I 'll begin preparations this very day . ''
Parsing [sent. 509 len. 8]: `` Here endeth the first volume ! ''
Parsing [sent. 510 len. 4]: chanted Madge shrilly .
Parsing [sent. 511 len. 22]: `` Now for excitement ; now for romance ; now for the third volume , with its honour and glory ! ''
Parsing [sent. 512 len. 7]: But Philippa shivered and was silent .
Parsing [sent. 513 len. 34]: The moment of reaction had come , and in her heart she said : `` But the second volume lies between , and in the second volume are all the trials and difficulties .
Parsing [sent. 514 len. 19]: Oh , it may be a long , long fight before we get to the happy ending ! ''
Parsing [sent. 515 len. 3]: CHAPTER FOUR .
Parsing [sent. 516 len. 3]: THE REMOVAL .
Parsing [sent. 517 len. 8]: Two months later the plunge was taken .
Parsing [sent. 518 len. 33]: The Charrington family said good-bye to their picturesque country home , and established themselves in the top flat of a massive red building in the picturesque district of the Tottenham Court Road .
Parsing [sent. 519 len. 44]: With one exception the rooms were small ; there was no passage to speak of ; the coal-cellar was in pleasing proximity to the drawing-room door ; the view consisted of a forest of chimney-stacks , and the air was thick with smuts .
Parsing [sent. 520 len. 38]: When Philippa made her first survey of the premises she felt that she was indeed coming down in the world ; but when she heard the rent demanded she changed her mind with a shock of surprise .
Parsing [sent. 521 len. 6]: It was preposterous -- incredible !
Parsing [sent. 522 len. 17]: The price of a palace rather than of a sooty tenement midway between earth and sky !
Parsing [sent. 523 len. 34]: For that price in the country one could have a tennis-lawn , and a stable , and a pretty flower and vegetable garden , to say nothing of a roomy and comfortable house .
Parsing [sent. 524 len. 53]: Off went Miss Charrington with her head in the air , but two long days of search brought her to the sad conviction that she would have to change her attitude with regard to London prices , and that the agent had been right in speaking of the flat as unusually cheap .
Parsing [sent. 525 len. 36]: She did not dare to take it , however , without a family consultation ; so she secured the option for a couple of days , and went home with the story of her wanderings .
Parsing [sent. 526 len. 33]: The girls howled in unison at the mention of the rent , but , like their sister , were obliged to come round to the conclusion that the money must be paid .
Parsing [sent. 527 len. 22]: `` It is really and truly the best thing I could find in a central position , '' said Philippa sadly .
Parsing [sent. 528 len. 26]: `` The question is -- ought we to give up the idea of living in town , and take a little house in the suburbs ?
Parsing [sent. 529 len. 17]: If we went out in an unfashionable direction we could get one for half the cost .
Parsing [sent. 530 len. 16]: I asked the agent , and he said there were any number to be had .
Parsing [sent. 531 len. 32]: They run them up in a few months -- rows and rows of them -- quite nice , compact little houses , with all modern conveniences -- '' `` I know !
Parsing [sent. 532 len. 8]: Thank you , '' interrupted Theo haughtily .
Parsing [sent. 533 len. 41]: `` I 've seen them from the train -- hundreds of them -- exactly alike , with sunflowers in the front garden , and the washing in the back , and such nice , sociable neighbours over the palings ! ''
Parsing [sent. 534 len. 17]: `` It 's all very well , Theo , but can we afford to be snobbish ?
Parsing [sent. 535 len. 16]: We shall have to pocket our pride , and save every penny-piece that is possible .
Parsing [sent. 536 len. 18]: If the house would be cheaper -- '' `` I 'm not so sure that it would .
Parsing [sent. 537 len. 10]: It is different for a man and his wife .
Parsing [sent. 538 len. 20]: But you must remember that we should have four , perhaps five railway contracts to add to the rent .
Parsing [sent. 539 len. 28]: Our great object is to be near our work , and we might almost as well stay where we are as bury ourselves in an out-of-the-way suburb .
Parsing [sent. 540 len. 49]: If we go to the flat , Madge will be almost next door to the Slade School , the boys can come home for lunch , and Hope and I will be near libraries and concerts , and have some chance of picking up odd pieces of work .
Parsing [sent. 541 len. 7]: Suppose I go in for journalism ?
Parsing [sent. 542 len. 28]: How am I to be in the hum of things when I live a dozen miles away , and have probably a bad service of trains ? ''
Parsing [sent. 543 len. 10]: `` Suppose I get accompanying to do at concerts ?
Parsing [sent. 544 len. 24]: I intend to call on some of the lady professionals who sing father 's songs and ask them to give me a chance .
Parsing [sent. 545 len. 62]: I shall have to get used to going about by myself at night , but it would be nice to be in a central position , and not have _ too _ far to go , '' said Hope wistfully ; and her eldest sister , looking at her golden locks and sweet pink-and-white face , came to a sudden determination .
Parsing [sent. 546 len. 7]: `` We will take the flat .
Parsing [sent. 547 len. 9]: It 's no use doing things by halves .
Parsing [sent. 548 len. 13]: We must hope to save the money in travelling expenses and lunches .
Parsing [sent. 549 len. 12]: I will write to the agent and settle it to-night . ''
Parsing [sent. 550 len. 20]: So the flat was taken , and the question of furniture was the next to come upon the tapis .
Parsing [sent. 551 len. 39]: For the larger articles there could be no accommodation ; they must be sold for what they would bring ; but even without them there was an incredible number of possessions with which it seemed impossible to part .
Parsing [sent. 552 len. 40]: Curtains were faded , carpets so darned and mended as to be incapable of removal , but Edgar Charrington had been picking up artistic treasures all his life , and the rooms were crowded with quaint , old-world furniture .
Parsing [sent. 553 len. 20]: There was a Chinese cabinet , shaped like a pagoda , with coloured Chinese figures standing in the niches .
Parsing [sent. 554 len. 53]: It would take up more room than could be spared , but who could bear to part with it , remembering the fascination of those figures to the infant mind , the later joy of turning over the contents of the daintily fitting drawers , and sniffing the sweet , musty odour ?
Parsing [sent. 555 len. 18]: There was an oak-framed picture of a church , with a real clock fitted into the steeple .
Parsing [sent. 556 len. 21]: A place for that must be found somewhere , or life would be robbed of one of its oldest associations .
Parsing [sent. 557 len. 42]: There was a black silhouette picture of Great-great-aunt Martha riding on a pillion ; and another of Grandfather and Grandmother Charrington , with a family of six little Charringtons , clad in _ decollete _ dresses , spencers , and pantaloons .
Parsing [sent. 558 len. 15]: What Goth or Vandal could find it in his heart to part with them ?
Parsing [sent. 559 len. 33]: There was a collection of old china , of pewter , of old beaten silver ; and such stacks of pictures , framed and unframed , as were quite alarming to count .
Parsing [sent. 560 len. 8]: `` What shall we do with them ?
Parsing [sent. 561 len. 18]: Shall we pack half away in chests and ask the vicar to store them in his loft ?
Parsing [sent. 562 len. 12]: He would be only too glad to keep them for us .
Parsing [sent. 563 len. 9]: It seems absurd to take such a collection .
Parsing [sent. 564 len. 31]: The place will look like a museum , '' cried Philippa , in despair ; but the idea seemed to commend itself rather than otherwise to her ambitious young sisters .
Parsing [sent. 565 len. 15]: `` Just what it ought to look , as a temple of the Muses .
Parsing [sent. 566 len. 11]: No use pretending to be artistic against a commonplace background .
Parsing [sent. 567 len. 19]: Let us make our rooms as striking , and unusual , and ` ancestory ' as we can .
Parsing [sent. 568 len. 14]: I hate a house that looks as if it had been furnished yesterday .
Parsing [sent. 569 len. 25]: When people come to call , they will : have a pretty good idea of what we are by looking round our rooms . ''
Parsing [sent. 570 len. 12]: `` But who is to come , you dear little snob ?
Parsing [sent. 571 len. 4]: We know nobody .
Parsing [sent. 572 len. 19]: I 'm afraid the arrival of the Charrington family wo n't make much stir in the great Metropolis .
Parsing [sent. 573 len. 35]: I can tell you I felt a lone , lorn creature , walking about those crowded streets , and thinking that not a single soul knew me or cared whether I lived or died .
Parsing [sent. 574 len. 43]: As for Aunt Loftus , she may come once , perhaps , to pay a formal call , but we sha 'n' t be troubled with her after that ; and I should be sorry to count upon uncle 's promised introductions .
Parsing [sent. 575 len. 9]: We shall be left severely to ourselves . ''
Parsing [sent. 576 len. 37]: `` I am going up to London to know and be known , and I am not going to be left alone for anybody , '' cried Madge , tossing her head with a consequential air .
Parsing [sent. 577 len. 12]: `` Seclusion may suit some people , but not this child .
Parsing [sent. 578 len. 14]: I 'm going to make friends , and have a real good time .
Parsing [sent. 579 len. 35]: I think I shall start a _ salon _ , like that Madame de Thingummy in Paris , and make our house the resort of all the learned and celebrated people of the day .
Parsing [sent. 580 len. 14]: I 've read about her in magazines , and it sounds quite easy .
Parsing [sent. 581 len. 55]: You do n't need to be pretty , nor rich , nor to live in a big house ; all you have to do is to announce that you are at home on certain evenings , and give cups of coffee , and be very vivacious , and talk , and make people laugh .
Parsing [sent. 582 len. 13]: _ You _ can give the coffee , and I 'll talk !
Parsing [sent. 583 len. 15]: There 's never any difficulty in that ; the trouble is to be quiet .
Parsing [sent. 584 len. 40]: Wait until you see Cabinet Ministers , and Presidents of the Academy , and celebrated authors all driving up to our door , and toiling up hundreds of steps on purpose to enjoy the fascinations of my society ! ''
Parsing [sent. 585 len. 8]: `` Very well ; I 'll wait .
Parsing [sent. 586 len. 9]: It will be good exercise for my patience .
Parsing [sent. 587 len. 29]: For my own part , I have resigned myself to single blessedness , staying at home cooking dinners and darning stockings while you are out making your fortunes .
Parsing [sent. 588 len. 20]: I shall be too busy to be lonely ; and if you earn money , I shall save it .
Parsing [sent. 589 len. 16]: We ca n't _ all _ be fascinating society leaders , '' said Philippa cruelly .
Parsing [sent. 590 len. 41]: She was so devoted to Madge , so tempted to applaud all that she said and did , that as a pure matter of conscience she felt bound to snub her now and then , just to show her impartiality !
Parsing [sent. 591 len. 33]: It had very little effect , however , for Miss Madge was too sharp not to see through the pretence , and refused to be in the least impressed by her strictures .
Parsing [sent. 592 len. 37]: What a comfort the girl was in the weeks which followed , when the burden of responsibility seemed to weigh ever more and more heavily on the shoulders of the two young heads of the family !
Parsing [sent. 593 len. 39]: Hope was always ready with sympathy , Theo with dramatic invectives against the cruelty of fate , but Madge met difficulties with a laugh and a jest , and the sound thereof was as sunshine in the house .
Parsing [sent. 594 len. 46]: In some respects fortune favoured the adventurers at the start , for Stephen 's firm made no difficulty about his removal , while Mr Matthews snapped at the offer of the house , and even promised to buy the fixtures `` at a valuation . ''
Parsing [sent. 595 len. 6]: But here the disappointments began .
Parsing [sent. 596 len. 80]: Philippa instantly made a valuation on her own account , and added generously to the total in consideration of those manifold odds and ends which accumulate in households of thirty years ' standing , but which are hardly worth the cost of cartage to pastures new : oddments of glass and china , of tin and iron and earthenware ; mouldy volumes which no one will read ; chairs minus a leg , rusty fire-irons , and damaged ornaments .
Parsing [sent. 597 len. 16]: `` With a little glue and patching you might make good things of them yet .
Parsing [sent. 598 len. 6]: Five pounds at the least !
Parsing [sent. 599 len. 6]: No ; say seven pounds .
Parsing [sent. 600 len. 12]: Seven pounds added to forty-five -- over fifty pounds in all !
Parsing [sent. 601 len. 16]: That ought to pay for the removal and leave something over for carpets and blinds .
Parsing [sent. 602 len. 15]: Thank goodness , I can mark _ that _ expense off the list ! ''
Parsing [sent. 603 len. 3]: sighed Philippa .
Parsing [sent. 604 len. 9]: But alas for the frailty of human hopes !
Parsing [sent. 605 len. 59]: The valuer 's estimate came to exactly a third of the sum expected , while one and all the dealers refused to bid for the valuable collection of antiquities , so that in the end a cart had to be hired to convey the whole to the village schoolroom , to be sold at a coming rummage sale !
Parsing [sent. 606 len. 23]: Scarcely had poor Philippa recovered from this blow than the estimate from the furniture remover arrived to cast her down once more .
Parsing [sent. 607 len. 12]: She screamed aloud when her eye lighted on the horrible total .
Parsing [sent. 608 len. 6]: But what could one do ?
Parsing [sent. 609 len. 18]: The things must be moved , and the firm in question had been recommended for its economy .
Parsing [sent. 610 len. 52]: It was appalling to think of the inroads into capital which would be made before the real life in town could begin ; and Philippa needed all her courage when the hour came to say good-bye to the old home , and go forth to prepare the flat for its inmates .
Parsing [sent. 611 len. 12]: Madge was to accompany her , as a matter of course .
Parsing [sent. 612 len. 20]: It had been so certain that she would be chosen as helper that the matter was not even discussed .
Parsing [sent. 613 len. 57]: Hope and Theo took refuge at the vicarage , Steve with a bachelor friend ; Barney was to remain at school until the half-term ; and Madge decreed that no one was to approach the flat until all preparations were finished , and the artistic beauty of the whole ready to burst upon the enraptured sight .
Parsing [sent. 614 len. 53]: Philippa thought of the chimney-pots , and the soot , and the narrow passages , and the weary flight of stairs , coldly clean , with bottles of fire-extinguisher ranged on the wall at each landing , to remind the dwellers on the top story of the peril in which they lived !
Parsing [sent. 615 len. 43]: She thought of the narrow , begrimed windows , of the cheap fireplaces , and the saffron paper in the sitting-room , and felt it her painful duty to undeceive the young enthusiast lest the blow might fall too heavily upon her .
Parsing [sent. 616 len. 22]: But Madge refused to be cast down , and went through the ordeal of the first inspection with an undaunted smile .
Parsing [sent. 617 len. 5]: `` My hat ! ''
Parsing [sent. 618 len. 60]: she exclaimed as she peered out of the first window and beheld the roof-scape in all the beauty of a drizzling autumn rain ; and though the expression was neither lady-like nor elegant , nor in the least degree appropriate , it yet had a quaint , whimsical sound which made Philippa laugh and draw a breath of relief .
Parsing [sent. 619 len. 3]: `` Yes !
Parsing [sent. 620 len. 5]: I told you so .
Parsing [sent. 621 len. 8]: I did n't exaggerate , you see .
Parsing [sent. 622 len. 8]: Cheerful and comprehensive , is n't it ?
Parsing [sent. 623 len. 5]: This is the dining-room .
Parsing [sent. 624 len. 14]: Not much room to spare when you have the table in the middle .
Parsing [sent. 625 len. 14]: I do n't know if we can get it in at all . ''
Parsing [sent. 626 len. 21]: `` If we ca n't we 'll dine at small tables like a restaurant -- far more _ chic _ .
Parsing [sent. 627 len. 11]: Not a bad little den when it is dressed up .
Parsing [sent. 628 len. 5]: Jolly cosy in winter .
Parsing [sent. 629 len. 15]: When summer comes I shall live up on the leads and make a roof-garden .
Parsing [sent. 630 len. 7]: Is there any way out ? ''
Parsing [sent. 631 len. 9]: `` Do n't know , I 'm sure .
Parsing [sent. 632 len. 7]: Come and look at the bedrooms .
Parsing [sent. 633 len. 33]: We can have first choice , I suppose , as I 'm the eldest ; but if you do n't mind , I 'd like the girls to be at the front .
Parsing [sent. 634 len. 28]: You could hardly imagine that the one at the side could be smaller and more dreary , but it is ; and Theo would be so wretched !
Parsing [sent. 635 len. 13]: Do you think we could possibly get our things in here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 636 len. 12]: Madge stood prospecting the small square box with a ruminating gaze .
Parsing [sent. 637 len. 20]: `` Bed there -- dressing-table there -- wash-stand there -- chest of -- No ; ca n't be done .
Parsing [sent. 638 len. 17]: We shall have to do without a dressing-table , and use the top of the bureau .
Parsing [sent. 639 len. 31]: We can manage all right that way ; but you will always have to get up first , and make way for me while I have my last little snooze .
Parsing [sent. 640 len. 21]: It will be good practice for our tempers , for we really dare n't quarrel in such very close quarters .
Parsing [sent. 641 len. 10]: Let 's look at the sitting-room for a change .
Parsing [sent. 642 len. 9]: You said that was a decent size . ''
Parsing [sent. 643 len. 13]: `` Oh yes -- quite ; and a pretty shape , too .
Parsing [sent. 644 len. 7]: Do n't you like the shape !
Parsing [sent. 645 len. 13]: Do n't you think that rounded window is sweet in the corner ?
Parsing [sent. 646 len. 21]: It would make a dear , quiet little nook if it were curtained off ; would n't it dear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 647 len. 45]: cried the eldest sister , anxious to divert the artist 's eyes from the saffron paper , with the aggressive roses and the gilded leaves , which was in such disastrously good condition that the company could not really be expected to replace it .
Parsing [sent. 648 len. 20]: `` Yes ; I 'll sit in there when I 'm engaged , and let the cord go free .
Parsing [sent. 649 len. 10]: A very good room , with plenty of possibilities .
Parsing [sent. 650 len. 7]: Nothing square and stiff about it .
Parsing [sent. 651 len. 24]: That corner would do charmingly for the cabinet ; and we will fit in shelves for the china in that funny little niche .
Parsing [sent. 652 len. 22]: We must keep the middle of the floor as clear as possible , for I shall want space for my receptions .
Parsing [sent. 653 len. 5]: _ Philippa Charrington _ !
Parsing [sent. 654 len. 20]: Do you mean to look me in the face and say that you are responsible for this paper ? ''
Parsing [sent. 655 len. 9]: `` No , no -- of course not .
Parsing [sent. 656 len. 6]: The last tenant left it .
Parsing [sent. 657 len. 12]: I begged hard for another , but it was no use .
Parsing [sent. 658 len. 26]: Make the best of it just now , there 's a dear , and perhaps in a year or so we may get another . ''
Parsing [sent. 659 len. 41]: `` We are going to have another before the week is out , '' declared Madge ; and when her sister protested , `` Look here , '' she said sturdily , `` let us come to a clear understanding .
Parsing [sent. 660 len. 32]: We made up our minds to make this move and to face the cost , and we are not going to spoil the house for the sake of a few pounds .
Parsing [sent. 661 len. 17]: Before we have done with putting things in order we shall have a dozen unexpected expenses .
Parsing [sent. 662 len. 26]: Things wo n't fit and will have to be altered ; we shall have to buy little fixings , and have workmen in and out .
Parsing [sent. 663 len. 17]: If you are going to groan over every sixpence we shall have a dismal old time .
Parsing [sent. 664 len. 23]: Make up your mind to pay and be cheerful , since you 've got to pay whether you like it or not .
Parsing [sent. 665 len. 4]: About this wall-paper !
Parsing [sent. 666 len. 26]: I suppose there are some families who could live in peace and happiness staring at yellow cabbages , but we are not one of them .
Parsing [sent. 667 len. 16]: We inherit artistic fastidiousness , and should hate them worse every day of our lives .
Parsing [sent. 668 len. 24]: When we ca n't afford to go out for amusements , is n't it our duty to make home as attractive as possible ?
Parsing [sent. 669 len. 29]: When we shall spend a round hundred over the removal , is it worth while to spoil our best room for the sake of an extra sovereign ? ''
Parsing [sent. 670 len. 13]: `` You ca n't possibly -- '' `` Yes , I can .
Parsing [sent. 671 len. 42]: I can buy a self-coloured paper for next to nothing -- a pretty soft blue , I think , to make a good background for the pictures -- and hang it myself , to save the expense of the workman . ''
Parsing [sent. 672 len. 10]: `` You ca n't possibly -- '' `` Nonsense !
Parsing [sent. 673 len. 18]: I did my own room at home , and there 's no matching about a plain paper .
Parsing [sent. 674 len. 12]: I could not face Theo with that atrocity on the walls .
Parsing [sent. 675 len. 11]: And besides , think of my _ salon _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 676 len. 5]: `` Oh , well !
Parsing [sent. 677 len. 14]: have it your own way , '' Philippa cried , with affected disgust .
Parsing [sent. 678 len. 43]: It was impossible not to feel more interest in the room now that it could be imagined in its pretty new dress , and the discussion of how it should be arranged and decorated occupied an hour out of a dreary wait .
Parsing [sent. 679 len. 36]: The sisters had slept the night before at a boarding-house , and had hurried to the flat directly after breakfast , so as to be ready to receive the furniture at ten o'clock as agreed .
Parsing [sent. 680 len. 48]: At eleven o'clock there was no sign of the vans ; but no one expects furniture-vans to be punctual within an hour or two , and until noon the girls managed to possess themselves in patience , and to find amusement in wandering from room to room .
Parsing [sent. 681 len. 11]: But when one o'clock drew near the matter became serious .
Parsing [sent. 682 len. 27]: They had brought a tea-basket with them , but there were no chairs on which to sit , no table to hold the cups and saucers .
Parsing [sent. 683 len. 28]: They were growing tired , and were longing to get to work while daylight lasted , and to have a bed to sleep on before night fell .
Parsing [sent. 684 len. 39]: It was two o'clock before the first van arrived , and seven before the men departed , leaving the two young mistresses to thread their way between stacks of furniture , unopened crates , and boxes of luggage .
Parsing [sent. 685 len. 46]: There was no room for a servant to sleep in the flat , and the charwoman who was engaged to help could not come until the following day , so it was hopeless to try to do more than get one bedroom in tolerable order .
Parsing [sent. 686 len. 38]: By Hope 's forethought the necessary blankets and linen had been packed in one box and plainly labelled , so preparations were soon made , and by eight o'clock the tired workers were already longing for bed .
Parsing [sent. 687 len. 50]: Downstairs in the basement was a public dining-room where dinner could be obtained for a shilling a head ; but they were too dishevelled and footsore to feel inclined to appear in public , so they refreshed themselves instead with more tea , more cakes , more dried-up sandwiches .
Parsing [sent. 688 len. 29]: Philippa leant back in her chair and sighed heavily as she looked first at her roughened hands , then at the hopeless disorder by which she was surrounded .
Parsing [sent. 689 len. 22]: `` I used to dream , '' she said slowly -- `` I used to dream of coming up to London .
Parsing [sent. 690 len. 40]: Father seemed so often on the eve of doing something great , and I used to imagine what it would be like if the book really turned out as he expected , or the picture made his name famous .
Parsing [sent. 691 len. 30]: He would have brought us to town , and we should have been rich , and every one would have wanted to know us -- '' `` I know !
Parsing [sent. 692 len. 16]: So have I. ` Beautiful Miss Charringtons -- the rage of the London season . '
Parsing [sent. 693 len. 11]: That 's the kind of thing , is n't it ?
Parsing [sent. 694 len. 18]: I 'm not beautiful , of course , but I 'm vivacious -- that 's my point .
Parsing [sent. 695 len. 18]: I can _ espiegle _ fifty times better than Hope , though she is such a darling .
Parsing [sent. 696 len. 23]: You are very handsome , Phil , when you look pleasant ; and Theo has the air of a princess in disguise .
Parsing [sent. 697 len. 6]: We are an interesting family .
Parsing [sent. 698 len. 12]: It seems hard lines that the world should not know us .
Parsing [sent. 699 len. 20]: We do seem slightly -- just a little -- what you might call _ cornered _ up here . ''
Parsing [sent. 700 len. 5]: `` We do indeed .
Parsing [sent. 701 len. 14]: Oh , it is different -- so different from what I expected ! ''
Parsing [sent. 702 len. 31]: faltered poor , tired Philippa , with a sob ; and then of a sudden her fears and dreads caught her in a grip from which there was no escape .
Parsing [sent. 703 len. 39]: She looked round the strange , unlovely room , through the bare window at the great city , lurid and threatening in the light of many lamps , and trembled at the thought of what she had done .
Parsing [sent. 704 len. 70]: She had been as a mother to these children , and she had brought them away from their peaceful home to face a thousand trials , a thousand difficulties : Stephen , constitutionally despondent , to be burdened with fresh responsibilities ; the girls , ardent and credulous , to be ready prey for unscrupulous acquaintances ; Barney , pining for mischief , to a swift and certain ruin !
Parsing [sent. 705 len. 19]: Her face blanched ; she held out her hands to her sister with a gesture of terrified appeal .
Parsing [sent. 706 len. 9]: `` Madge , Madge , I 'm frightened !
Parsing [sent. 707 len. 7]: Suppose it is all a mistake !
Parsing [sent. 708 len. 22]: Suppose we fail , and all the money goes , and we are left penniless and alone in this great wilderness !
Parsing [sent. 709 len. 41]: I have read of it so often : people come up hoping to make their fortunes , and the time passes , and they move into smaller and smaller rooms -- and no work comes -- and they fall ill .
Parsing [sent. 710 len. 5]: It is my doing !
Parsing [sent. 711 len. 4]: I persuaded Stephen .
Parsing [sent. 712 len. 24]: Oh Madge , if it 's all a mistake , you will believe I did it for the best , wo n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 713 len. 7]: I was not thinking of myself .
Parsing [sent. 714 len. 13]: It would have been easier for me to stay where we were .
Parsing [sent. 715 len. 15]: You will not blame me if the money goes and there is none left ?
Parsing [sent. 716 len. 9]: Promise that you will never blame me . ''
Parsing [sent. 717 len. 19]: But Madge lay back in her chair and folded her arms out of reach of the trembling hands .
Parsing [sent. 718 len. 7]: `` I will , though ! ''
Parsing [sent. 719 len. 4]: she replied bluntly .
Parsing [sent. 720 len. 23]: `` I 'll make an awful row ; and quite right , too , for it _ will _ be your fault .
Parsing [sent. 721 len. 24]: If you lose heart the very first night , and fall to crying and groaning , how do you expect to get on ?
Parsing [sent. 722 len. 27]: If _ you _ get low in your mind , Steve will be indigo , and Hope and Theo will have no spirit left in them .
Parsing [sent. 723 len. 62]: As for me , I 'm not _ going _ to fail , nor fall ill , nor starve , nor throw myself over London Bridge , nor anything else interesting or melodramatic I 've always longed to come up to town , and now that I am here I am going to enjoy myself in the best way I can .
Parsing [sent. 724 len. 29]: It is ripping to work hard when you feel you are getting on , and a little taste of success now and then will be a wonderful fillip .
Parsing [sent. 725 len. 38]: There must be some compensations for being poor , and I mean to find them out , and see if I ca n't get as much fun for sixpence as Avice Loftus does for a sovereign . ''
Parsing [sent. 726 len. 17]: `` I -- I believe you will , '' said Philippa , with a feeble laugh .
Parsing [sent. 727 len. 31]: `` You must n't think me a coward , Madge ; I could be brave for myself ; but it is the awful feeling of responsibility that weighs upon me .
Parsing [sent. 728 len. 16]: All this day I have been saying to myself , ` Now we are here .
Parsing [sent. 729 len. 6]: What is the next step ?
Parsing [sent. 730 len. 9]: What ought we to do next ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 731 len. 9]: `` Go to bed , I should say .
Parsing [sent. 732 len. 24]: You look as if you needed it , '' came the curt rejoinder ; and at that Philippa was obliged to laugh outright .
Parsing [sent. 733 len. 9]: `` Oh , Mr Dick , Mr Dick !
Parsing [sent. 734 len. 5]: your common-sense is invaluable .
Parsing [sent. 735 len. 9]: Come along , then ; let us go .
Parsing [sent. 736 len. 19]: We shall need all the rest we can get to prepare us for our hard work to-morrow . ''
Parsing [sent. 737 len. 3]: CHAPTER FIVE .
Parsing [sent. 738 len. 3]: FIRST IMPRESSIONS .
Parsing [sent. 739 len. 42]: A week after the girls had taken possession of the flat Stephen joined them , and spent his evenings carpentering , hanging up pictures , and laying carpets , as a pleasant relaxation after a day 's work in the City .
Parsing [sent. 740 len. 48]: He had been unpleasantly surprised to discover that , though the firm for which he worked was of long standing and first-class position , its offices were by no means so large or so comfortable as those which he had left behind in the little country town .
Parsing [sent. 741 len. 44]: The room in which he worked was so dark that the gas seemed to be burning all day long ; the windows looked out on a narrow side-street ; there was a continual roar of traffic , a rumbling from the trains underground .
Parsing [sent. 742 len. 14]: His head ached , and he found it impossible to concentrate his thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 743 len. 48]: But when the long day came to an end , there was a certain exhilaration in walking home through the crowded streets , in looking at historic scenes , and feeling that one was an inmate of the greatest city , of the capital of the world !
Parsing [sent. 744 len. 32]: Every evening , too , the flat looked more home-like , as suitable resting-places were discovered for the old furniture , and the familiar pictures smiled a welcome from the walls .
Parsing [sent. 745 len. 33]: Madge 's paper-hanging had been a success of which she was justly proud , and the little dining-room looked both pretty and cosy when the curtains were drawn and the lamps lighted .
Parsing [sent. 746 len. 63]: The girls were tired but cheerful , and had always amusing little anecdotes to relate as gleanings from the day 's work ; the workmen , the charwoman , the porter at the door downstairs , were all so different from the country-folk to whom they had been accustomed ; and imitation of the Cockney accent proved an unfailing source of delight .
Parsing [sent. 747 len. 43]: Madge cultivated special sentences with a view to impressing her sisters on their arrival , and when they drove up to the door , insisted upon `` p ` ying the keb '' with a vehemence which left them speechless with consternation .
Parsing [sent. 748 len. 35]: Hope and Theo were conveyed upstairs flight after flight -- for the lift had not yet been introduced into these unfashionable mansions -- and when at last they could go no farther , lo !
Parsing [sent. 749 len. 44]: there was an open door , a blaze of light sending forth a welcome , and the new home all ready to receive them , even to the very tea on the table , and hot water in the basins in the bedrooms .
Parsing [sent. 750 len. 56]: It was delightful to meet again , to have the first meal in the new home , to feel that the step so long contemplated was an accomplished fact ; and if a certain amount of disillusion had to be endured , the new-comers had enough good feeling to notice only what they could admire .
Parsing [sent. 751 len. 39]: Dark though it was , it was scarcely seven o'clock when the evening meal was finished ; and in the state of pent-up excitement in which the travellers found themselves , it seemed impossible to stay quietly indoors .
Parsing [sent. 752 len. 10]: `` Could n't we _ do _ something ? ''
Parsing [sent. 753 len. 4]: asked Hope wistfully .
Parsing [sent. 754 len. 17]: `` I feel like a caged lion shut up here , knowing that London lies outside .
Parsing [sent. 755 len. 12]: We need not go to bed for three hours at least .
Parsing [sent. 756 len. 3]: Oh Steve !
Parsing [sent. 757 len. 30]: the top of an omnibus -- a drive along the streets , with all the lights -- past Saint Paul 's and the Abbey , and along the Embankment .
Parsing [sent. 758 len. 5]: Could we do it ?
Parsing [sent. 759 len. 11]: Oh , do you think we might do it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 760 len. 28]: The eager voice and pleading eyes raised a general laugh of amusement , and even the prudent Stephen could find no objection to so innocent a request .
Parsing [sent. 761 len. 13]: `` Well , really , I think we might rise to that .
Parsing [sent. 762 len. 17]: Put on warm coats , and we will lock the door behind us and sally forth .
Parsing [sent. 763 len. 21]: An omnibus to Saint Paul 's , and another to Victoria Station , and back the best way we can .
Parsing [sent. 764 len. 15]: I do n't know the ropes yet , but we shall easily find out .
Parsing [sent. 765 len. 24]: It will do Phil and Madge good , too , for they have hardly stirred out of the flat this last fortnight . ''
Parsing [sent. 766 len. 6]: No sooner said than done .
Parsing [sent. 767 len. 51]: It was astonishing how quickly hats and jackets were donned , and in a quarter of an hour 's time the four girls were fearfully clambering up the narrow steps leading to the top of a `` City '' ` bus , and taking their seats on the foremost benches .
Parsing [sent. 768 len. 40]: Hope took an outside place , but begged to change seats before she had driven a hundred yards ; at every turn and crossing her heart died within her , and she seemed to look death in the face .
Parsing [sent. 769 len. 28]: She hung on to Philippa 's arm and groaned incessantly , but when asked if she would like to return home , `` Oh no , no !
Parsing [sent. 770 len. 17]: I love it , '' she cried , and groaned again , more fearfully than before .
Parsing [sent. 771 len. 49]: The other occupants of the benches stared with curious gaze at the five young people , whose animation was in such marked contrast to their own phlegmatic calm ; and Theo studied them in her turn , making up little romances concerning them , as her nature was .
Parsing [sent. 772 len. 14]: `` That fat dark man is married to the little woman in blue .
Parsing [sent. 773 len. 16]: She was left an orphan , and he was a friend of her father 's .
Parsing [sent. 774 len. 23]: He offered to marry her , and she was lonely and sad , and did n't care very much what she did .
Parsing [sent. 775 len. 21]: He is very kind to her ; he is carrying all the parcels ; but her heart is n't satisfied .
Parsing [sent. 776 len. 23]: She stares before her all the time , and never speaks ... The girl with the pearl beads serves in a shop .
Parsing [sent. 777 len. 21]: She is going home to a suburb , and her ` young man ' will meet her at the station .
Parsing [sent. 778 len. 20]: They are going to have a little shop together , and she is thinking how she will manage it .
Parsing [sent. 779 len. 7]: How she does turn and twist !
Parsing [sent. 780 len. 11]: Her hair is like a great turban round her head .
Parsing [sent. 781 len. 27]: She would be pretty if she would not spoil herself so ... That poor , sad-looking young fellow has just had notice to leave his situation .
Parsing [sent. 782 len. 10]: He is thinking how he can tell his wife .
Parsing [sent. 783 len. 14]: He will put his arms round her , and they will cry together .
Parsing [sent. 784 len. 23]: She will kiss him and say , ` For better , for worse , dear ; for richer , for poorer . '
Parsing [sent. 785 len. 7]: Her voice will be like music .
Parsing [sent. 786 len. 12]: He will look at her , and his face will shine .
Parsing [sent. 787 len. 3]: Oh dear !
Parsing [sent. 788 len. 5]: I am crying myself .
Parsing [sent. 789 len. 3]: How stupid !
Parsing [sent. 790 len. 24]: I 'll write an article -- ` On a City ` Bus ' -- a character sketch , short and strong and dramatic .
Parsing [sent. 791 len. 7]: Where shall I send it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 792 len. 39]: She went off into a reverie , turning over in her mind the names of different papers and magazines , planning , wondering , weaving dreams , while the omnibus made its way down Holborn towards the Viaduct .
Parsing [sent. 793 len. 8]: Madge and Steve were chattering gaily together .
Parsing [sent. 794 len. 18]: Hope sat with clasped hands , gazing eagerly ahead for the first glimpse of the majestic dome .
Parsing [sent. 795 len. 44]: Tired Philippa blinked at the rows of lamps , the flaring advertisements , and gaily lighted saloons , and wished that the drive would last for hours , so that she might sit still and feel the refreshing night-air play upon her brow .
Parsing [sent. 796 len. 52]: She groaned when the stoppage came and Madge pulled her impatiently by the arm ; and had nothing but yawns to mingle with her sisters ' ecstasies as they stood at the corner of the Churchyard , and gazed and gazed until it seemed that they would never tear themselves away .
Parsing [sent. 797 len. 23]: Hope was hearing in imagination the swell of the great organ , the reed-like sweetness of the voices of the white-robed choristers .
Parsing [sent. 798 len. 28]: Madge was already painting a picture of the great edifice by night , the twinkling lights beneath , the vast outline losing itself mysteriously in the clouds .
Parsing [sent. 799 len. 14]: Theo was trembling , and biting her lips to keep back the tears .
Parsing [sent. 800 len. 18]: To her it was not a building at all ; it was a sign -- a symbol !
Parsing [sent. 801 len. 47]: The wide steps were not empty -- she saw on them the blaze of great national pageants ; the wide nave was filled with happy faces , with black-robed women who wept and wrung their hands ; in her ears was the tramp of armed men .
Parsing [sent. 802 len. 10]: She shivered and drew her cloak closely round her .
Parsing [sent. 803 len. 21]: When the next omnibus for Victoria came along she took a surreptitious opportunity of flicking the drops from her eyelashes .
Parsing [sent. 804 len. 9]: Some day she would write about this too !
Parsing [sent. 805 len. 19]: Oh , what wealth of subjects , what capital , what inspiration in this wonderful , throbbing world !
Parsing [sent. 806 len. 20]: And then Stephen tapped her on the shoulder and cried a well-known name : `` Fleet Street , Theo !
Parsing [sent. 807 len. 6]: Allow me to introduce you .
Parsing [sent. 808 len. 8]: Your special beat , my dear . ''
Parsing [sent. 809 len. 4]: `` My publishers !
Parsing [sent. 810 len. 6]: Where are my publishers ! ''
Parsing [sent. 811 len. 24]: cried Theo loudly , as though she expected to see the heads of the great firms ranged in a body to greet her .
Parsing [sent. 812 len. 18]: The other occupants of the benches overheard her words , and gazed upon her with becoming awe .
Parsing [sent. 813 len. 7]: This was evidently a distinguished author !
Parsing [sent. 814 len. 22]: Note her well -- consider her features , so that she may be recognised by the portraits in the shop windows !
Parsing [sent. 815 len. 14]: Philippa smiled whimsically at the thought that already Theo had made an impression .
Parsing [sent. 816 len. 14]: What further triumphs or humiliations had this Fleet Street in store for her ?
Parsing [sent. 817 len. 8]: Well , it was a wonderful drive !
Parsing [sent. 818 len. 28]: If Saint Paul 's had been impressive , what about that glorious pile of buildings at Westminster , and the first glimpse of the river by night !
Parsing [sent. 819 len. 25]: It was like a dream -- a wonderful dream -- in which the imagined glories of the world passed in review before the eyes .
Parsing [sent. 820 len. 47]: That night the girls were in the clouds , lifted far above mercenary anxieties ; but they came back to earth again next morning when their boxes had been unpacked and stored away , and they were confronted with the all-important question of the next move .
Parsing [sent. 821 len. 22]: When lunch was over silence fell suddenly upon the little room , and four pairs of eyes met in solemn conclave .
Parsing [sent. 822 len. 22]: `` I -- er -- I shall go round to the Slade School and make inquiries , '' said Madge quickly .
Parsing [sent. 823 len. 14]: `` We are settled down now , and must lose no more time .
Parsing [sent. 824 len. 14]: I shall ask what is the very first day I can join . ''
Parsing [sent. 825 len. 16]: `` I shall write to Mr Hammond , the editor of the _ Casket _ .
Parsing [sent. 826 len. 19]: His firm publish books as well as the magazine , and he took most of father 's things .
Parsing [sent. 827 len. 35]: I shall ask him if he can see me for ten minutes , as I am thinking of devoting myself to literature as a profession , and should be grateful for his advice . ''
Parsing [sent. 828 len. 37]: `` I -- er -- I am going to pay a call at Hampstead , '' said Hope , trying to look confident and self-possessed , but flushing a tell-tale pink all over her delicate face .
Parsing [sent. 829 len. 18]: `` You remember the name of Miss Minnie Caldecott , who sings some of father 's songs ?
Parsing [sent. 830 len. 16]: I found one of her cards , and she is at home every Tuesday afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 831 len. 16]: I thought if I went early I might see her before any one else arrived .
Parsing [sent. 832 len. 22]: I have been working at that new song ever since you left , Phil , and it _ is _ pretty !
Parsing [sent. 833 len. 37]: It 's the best thing I have written , and if she took a fancy to it , and promised to sing it at concerts , it would be so much easier to find a publisher .
Parsing [sent. 834 len. 17]: If I can summon courage I shall ask her to let me accompany her as well .
Parsing [sent. 835 len. 27]: If I could sell a few songs , and make a little money by playing accompaniments , it would help to pay for my lessons . ''
Parsing [sent. 836 len. 3]: Poor Hope !
Parsing [sent. 837 len. 24]: She looked at once so frightened , so eager , and so pretty that her sisters broke into a simultaneous murmur of sympathy .
Parsing [sent. 838 len. 12]: `` I 'll go with you , '' said Philippa quickly .
Parsing [sent. 839 len. 13]: `` You must have some one to support you , poor dear !
Parsing [sent. 840 len. 15]: And how -- oh , how are we going to find our way ? ''
Parsing [sent. 841 len. 6]: `` Ask the porter downstairs .
Parsing [sent. 842 len. 18]: We shall have to go about alone , so the sooner we puzzle it out the better .
Parsing [sent. 843 len. 7]: Yes , do come , Phil !
Parsing [sent. 844 len. 19]: If you do n't , I shall probably run away as soon as I 've rung the bell .
Parsing [sent. 845 len. 11]: Will she be very formidable , do you think ? ''
Parsing [sent. 846 len. 9]: Philippa did not know , could not conjecture .
Parsing [sent. 847 len. 12]: Professional singers existed for her only on the programmes of concerts .
Parsing [sent. 848 len. 16]: She had never heard one more celebrated than Miss James , the singing-mistress from Coventry .
Parsing [sent. 849 len. 26]: Sometimes , she believed , they were paid fabulous prices for singing ; but Minnie Caldecott did not seem to come in the first rank .
Parsing [sent. 850 len. 13]: Perhaps she , like themselves , was struggling to make her name .
Parsing [sent. 851 len. 33]: The girls found their way to Hampstead with wonderfully little trouble ; but it was more difficult to find Mayfield Rood , and they wandered about for half-an-hour before discovering its whereabouts .
Parsing [sent. 852 len. 38]: It was not an attractive situation ; neither was the house a palatial residence ; and though Miss Caldecott was `` at home '' as usual , the costume of the servant-maid left much to be desired .
Parsing [sent. 853 len. 38]: She led the way down a narrow entrance-hall , and showed the visitors into a room at the back of the house , saying that Miss Caldecott would be with them in a few minutes ' time .
Parsing [sent. 854 len. 39]: It was barely half-past three , yet two lamps were already burning under elaborate pink shades , and there was a profusion of flowers on the mantelpiece and on the small tables with which the floor was crowded .
Parsing [sent. 855 len. 42]: The piano stood open , with a litter of torn sheets on the top , and there were photographs -- photographs everywhere -- of extraordinary-looking people , who all seemed to write their names underneath with fat quill-pens and many dashes .
Parsing [sent. 856 len. 49]: The lady with the little ring in the middle of her forehead was `` Mabs ; '' the one swinging in a hammock was `` Bella ; '' `` Fanny '' smirked from a bower of palms , and wore ropes and ropes of pearls round her neck .
Parsing [sent. 857 len. 15]: There was a framed photograph on the wall with a signature like the rest .
Parsing [sent. 858 len. 43]: From across the room Hope recognised a familiar name , and was about to rise to study it close at hand , when swish-swish came the rustle of silken skirts , the door opened , and Miss Caldecott herself made her appearance .
Parsing [sent. 859 len. 3]: CHAPTER SIX .
Parsing [sent. 860 len. 5]: HOPE 'S FIRST VENTURE .
Parsing [sent. 861 len. 45]: Miss Caldecott was tall and stout , had wavy hair and arched eyebrows , and wore a slightly _ decollete _ gown of blue silk , a trifle soiled if you looked at it in a critical spirit , but wonderfully elaborate and becoming .
Parsing [sent. 862 len. 20]: The broad , beaming face was young , and but for its undue size would have been strikingly pretty .
Parsing [sent. 863 len. 31]: She looked at the sisters , showing her straight , white teeth in the most friendly of smiles , and squeezed Hope 's hand until she winced with the pain .
Parsing [sent. 864 len. 9]: `` How do you do , dear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 865 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 866 len. 7]: `` How d'do , dear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 867 len. 3]: to Philippa .
Parsing [sent. 868 len. 8]: `` Wretched day , is n't it ?
Parsing [sent. 869 len. 7]: So good of you to come !
Parsing [sent. 870 len. 5]: Sit down and rest .
Parsing [sent. 871 len. 12]: I always flop on the sofa the moment I come in .
Parsing [sent. 872 len. 9]: So tiring dragging about , is n't it ?
Parsing [sent. 873 len. 5]: But you are thin .
Parsing [sent. 874 len. 9]: Wait until you get fat like me . ''
Parsing [sent. 875 len. 18]: Her shoulders shook ; her eyes danced ; the dimples dipped in her round , pink cheeks .
Parsing [sent. 876 len. 24]: Philippa and Hope were obliged to laugh in sympathy , but it was very embarrassing ; she evidently mistook them for old friends .
Parsing [sent. 877 len. 10]: Hope cleared her throat and began the rehearsed explanation .
Parsing [sent. 878 len. 12]: `` I am Hope Charrington , and this is my sister .
Parsing [sent. 879 len. 10]: You knew my father -- by name at least .
Parsing [sent. 880 len. 10]: You used to sing some of his songs . ''
Parsing [sent. 881 len. 11]: Miss Caldecott looked blank ; then she began to laugh .
Parsing [sent. 882 len. 8]: It appeared that she was always laughing .
Parsing [sent. 883 len. 10]: `` Then I did n't know you after all !
Parsing [sent. 884 len. 23]: Heaps of people come to see me , and I 've the silliest memory -- always forget what I ought to remember .
Parsing [sent. 885 len. 9]: Does n't make much difference , does it ?
Parsing [sent. 886 len. 7]: I know you _ now _ .
Parsing [sent. 887 len. 9]: Sung your father 's songs , did I ?
Parsing [sent. 888 len. 2]: Charrington !
Parsing [sent. 889 len. 2]: Charrington !
Parsing [sent. 890 len. 4]: Do n't remember .
Parsing [sent. 891 len. 10]: What were they called , do you know ? ''
Parsing [sent. 892 len. 5]: Hope 's heart sank .
Parsing [sent. 893 len. 18]: She had expected the name to act as an open-sesame , and it was not even recognised .
Parsing [sent. 894 len. 25]: `` One was ` A Song of Summer , ' '' she said slowly , `` and another ` Into the Night . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 895 len. 3]: `` La-la-la-La !
Parsing [sent. 896 len. 2]: Ta-ta-ta-Ta !
Parsing [sent. 897 len. 9]: Refrain went like that , did n't it ?
Parsing [sent. 898 len. 3]: I remember .
Parsing [sent. 899 len. 7]: Pretty change in the second verse .
Parsing [sent. 900 len. 8]: High G sustained in the last bar .
Parsing [sent. 901 len. 12]: I used to bless him when I came to that note .
Parsing [sent. 902 len. 8]: And he is dead , you say ?
Parsing [sent. 903 len. 4]: What a pity .
Parsing [sent. 904 len. 5]: So clever , too !
Parsing [sent. 905 len. 4]: Do you compose ?
Parsing [sent. 906 len. 7]: You have a musical face . ''
Parsing [sent. 907 len. 7]: Here was a lead , indeed !
Parsing [sent. 908 len. 15]: Hope flushed with eagerness , and her voice broke with a little nervous tremor .
Parsing [sent. 909 len. 28]: Miss Caldecott was so friendly , so open , so far removed from being formidable that it was impossible to believe that she could refuse her request .
Parsing [sent. 910 len. 7]: `` Oh yes , I do .
Parsing [sent. 911 len. 12]: That 's what I came to speak to you about to-day .
Parsing [sent. 912 len. 18]: We have come up to London to try to find work , for we are very poor .
Parsing [sent. 913 len. 29]: As you had liked father 's songs , I was going to ask if you would be so very , very kind as to try one of mine .
Parsing [sent. 914 len. 7]: I have it with me now .
Parsing [sent. 915 len. 34]: Messrs Holding and Co. published one for me before , and if you liked this , and would promise to sing it , they would be so much more willing to accept it .
Parsing [sent. 916 len. 9]: It is very bold of me to ask .
Parsing [sent. 917 len. 12]: I am horribly nervous , but you are so kind . ''
Parsing [sent. 918 len. 8]: Miss Caldecott laughed and shook her head .
Parsing [sent. 919 len. 12]: `` Not in business matters , dear , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 920 len. 12]: `` I have to keep my wits about me in business .
Parsing [sent. 921 len. 13]: If you knew the shoals of things I have sent to me !
Parsing [sent. 922 len. 7]: But I hate to say no .
Parsing [sent. 923 len. 10]: Got the song with you , do you say ?
Parsing [sent. 924 len. 16]: Strum it over , like a dear , and let me hear how it goes .
Parsing [sent. 925 len. 8]: Sing it too , if you can .
Parsing [sent. 926 len. 8]: I 've got a horrid cold . ''
Parsing [sent. 927 len. 4]: Hope rose eagerly .
Parsing [sent. 928 len. 17]: She had been prepared for this , and was less nervous in playing than in speaking .
Parsing [sent. 929 len. 38]: The piano was delightful ; she was tingling to make the most of her opportunity , and played the introductory bars with a dainty finish which brought Miss Caldecott 's eyes upon her with an appreciatory flash .
Parsing [sent. 930 len. 25]: She listened in silence to the first verse , nodding her head to and fro , then turned to Philippa with another beaming smile .
Parsing [sent. 931 len. 9]: `` Nice little pipe , has n't she ?
Parsing [sent. 932 len. 6]: Sweet and simple like herself .
Parsing [sent. 933 len. 3]: I say !
Parsing [sent. 934 len. 13]: it would n't go far in the Albert Hall , would it ?
Parsing [sent. 935 len. 7]: Let me try a verse . ''
Parsing [sent. 936 len. 23]: She put down her hands on either side , lifted herself from her low chair , and went over to the piano .
Parsing [sent. 937 len. 6]: `` What are the words ?
Parsing [sent. 938 len. 6]: Oh , I can see .
Parsing [sent. 939 len. 16]: Fire away , then , and I 'll see what I can make of it .
Parsing [sent. 940 len. 16]: `` Pack clouds away , and welcome day -- With night we 'll banish sorrow .
Parsing [sent. 941 len. 6]: `` Funny words , dear !
Parsing [sent. 942 len. 8]: Where did you get hold of them ?
Parsing [sent. 943 len. 17]: It 's not bad , you know -- not half bad -- what I call graceful .
Parsing [sent. 944 len. 14]: Let 's try again , and go on to the next verse . ''
Parsing [sent. 945 len. 12]: This time she drew herself up and sang with careful attention .
Parsing [sent. 946 len. 25]: The full , rich tones of her voice flooded the room , and Hope thrilled with delight at the sound of her own creation .
Parsing [sent. 947 len. 26]: Never -- no , never -- had she imagined that it could be so charming ; and the last verse was the prettiest of all .
Parsing [sent. 948 len. 16]: Surely if Miss Caldecott liked the beginning , she would be enraptured with the end !
Parsing [sent. 949 len. 4]: But , alas !
Parsing [sent. 950 len. 24]: at the conclusion of the second verse Miss Caldecott crossed the room and threw herself on the sofa , with a resounding yawn .
Parsing [sent. 951 len. 6]: `` Thanks awfully , dear .
Parsing [sent. 952 len. 5]: How clever of you !
Parsing [sent. 953 len. 5]: It really is sweet .
Parsing [sent. 954 len. 12]: Does n't quite suit my voice , though , does it ?
Parsing [sent. 955 len. 8]: And I do n't like those accidentals .
Parsing [sent. 956 len. 12]: They are tricky , and I 'm such a careless creature .
Parsing [sent. 957 len. 8]: Where did you pick up the words ?
Parsing [sent. 958 len. 21]: I do n't know the author , but you can tell him from me that he ca n't write songs .
Parsing [sent. 959 len. 6]: Not at all catchy words .
Parsing [sent. 960 len. 9]: He 'll have to do better than that .
Parsing [sent. 961 len. 16]: Do n't sit perched up there any more , dear ; you look so uncomfortable .
Parsing [sent. 962 len. 15]: There 'll be some other people coming presently , and we 'll have tea .
Parsing [sent. 963 len. 9]: I bought some lovely cakes from Buzzard 's .
Parsing [sent. 964 len. 24]: Always make a bit of a splash on my at-home afternoons , you know , for it 's the only entertaining I do .
Parsing [sent. 965 len. 14]: I 'm in digs here , and very bad they are , too .
Parsing [sent. 966 len. 6]: But what can one do ?
Parsing [sent. 967 len. 13]: They do n't send for me at the Albert Hall , dear .
Parsing [sent. 968 len. 28]: It 's a shame , for I could do ever so much better than some of those old , worn-out things who only trade on a name .
Parsing [sent. 969 len. 19]: My voice is fresh , and a jolly good one , too , though I say it myself .
Parsing [sent. 970 len. 9]: Where are _ you _ living , dear ?
Parsing [sent. 971 len. 5]: In this neighbourhood ? ''
Parsing [sent. 972 len. 3]: Philippa replied .
Parsing [sent. 973 len. 15]: Hope was too disappointed , too cast down , to be able to speak .
Parsing [sent. 974 len. 17]: Miss Caldecott had seemed so pleased ; the song had sounded so charming from her lips .
Parsing [sent. 975 len. 23]: At one minute acceptance had seemed certain ; at the next the subject was waved aside , and apparently dismissed from consideration .
Parsing [sent. 976 len. 25]: She pressed her lips together and stared at the mantelpiece , with its bank of chrysanthemums in cream-jars , its photographs of becurled beauties .
Parsing [sent. 977 len. 35]: Philippa was talking about the flat , and removal expenses generally , and Miss Caldecott was lavishing floods of sympathy upon her , and abuse upon those who had disappointed or thwarted her plans .
Parsing [sent. 978 len. 11]: `` Wretched , good-for-nothing things , the pack of them !
Parsing [sent. 979 len. 8]: But you are so near Maple 's .
Parsing [sent. 980 len. 15]: Why do n't you go to Maple and let him do the whole thing ?
Parsing [sent. 981 len. 2]: Expense !
Parsing [sent. 982 len. 2]: Bills !
Parsing [sent. 983 len. 5]: Oh , bother bills !
Parsing [sent. 984 len. 9]: You can let them run , you know .
Parsing [sent. 985 len. 5]: _ I _ do !
Parsing [sent. 986 len. 16]: If I want a thing I get it , and think about the bill afterwards .
Parsing [sent. 987 len. 6]: Do you like this tea-gown ?
Parsing [sent. 988 len. 8]: I bought it at the autumn sales .
Parsing [sent. 989 len. 4]: Such a bargain !
Parsing [sent. 990 len. 9]: I have to spend a fortune in clothes .
Parsing [sent. 991 len. 19]: What would you advise me to get for this winter , for really swell affairs , you know ?
Parsing [sent. 992 len. 9]: I go to a good many private receptions .
Parsing [sent. 993 len. 7]: I got some patterns this morning .
Parsing [sent. 994 len. 7]: I look so huge in white !
Parsing [sent. 995 len. 9]: What would you think of yellow -- eh ?
Parsing [sent. 996 len. 6]: Blue is so ordinary . ''
Parsing [sent. 997 len. 13]: `` Really , I -- really , I do n't know . ''
Parsing [sent. 998 len. 33]: Philippa thought it was better to laugh outright than in a covert manner , so she laughed as she spoke , and Miss Caldecott joined in the strain with the greatest good-humour .
Parsing [sent. 999 len. 16]: `` I 'm sure you have good taste , dear ; you look so stylish .
Parsing [sent. 1000 len. 11]: I never wear black myself ; it makes me doleful .
Parsing [sent. 1001 len. 13]: I do get doleful sometimes , though you would n't think it .
Parsing [sent. 1002 len. 12]: I live all alone , and sometimes business gets so slack .
Parsing [sent. 1003 len. 17]: I get plenty of suburban work , but I do n't come to the front somehow .
Parsing [sent. 1004 len. 5]: Ca n't think why .
Parsing [sent. 1005 len. 18]: My voice is far better than that Marah Bryce 's , whom they all rave about nowadays .
Parsing [sent. 1006 len. 7]: Have you heard her lately ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1007 len. 45]: Philippa felt relieved to be able to reply in the negative , and Miss Caldecott enlarged at great length on the personal deformities , mental blemishes , and vocal limitations of her rival , even condescending to imitate her rendering of a favourite song .
Parsing [sent. 1008 len. 8]: `` High-flown rubbish , I call it !
Parsing [sent. 1009 len. 16]: Something like that song of yours , '' she said blandly , turning to Hope .
Parsing [sent. 1010 len. 8]: `` You might offer it to her .
Parsing [sent. 1011 len. 7]: Far more her style than mine .
Parsing [sent. 1012 len. 11]: Do n't you say I sent you , though . ''
Parsing [sent. 1013 len. 9]: `` Thank you , '' said Hope softly .
Parsing [sent. 1014 len. 10]: `` I think I should hardly like to venture .
Parsing [sent. 1015 len. 14]: I do n't know her at all , so it 's quite different .
Parsing [sent. 1016 len. 63]: You knew our name at least , and I thought -- I hoped -- '' Despite herself , Hope 's voice broke with a little quiver of disappointment , for she had counted so much on this woman 's help ; and if she refused , what could be expected from a stranger on whom she had no possible claim for sympathy ?
Parsing [sent. 1017 len. 19]: Her face looked so drawn and pale that Miss Caldecott 's good-nature could not look at it unmoved .
Parsing [sent. 1018 len. 8]: `` What 's the matter , dear ?
Parsing [sent. 1019 len. 2]: Disappointed !
Parsing [sent. 1020 len. 8]: Hateful of me , is n't it ?
Parsing [sent. 1021 len. 12]: But I could n't sing that song even to please you .
Parsing [sent. 1022 len. 19]: I 'll tell you what we will do , though ; you shall write another especially for me .
Parsing [sent. 1023 len. 25]: Mezzo-soprano , you know ; I do n't mind a G now and then , but do n't let me have them too often .
Parsing [sent. 1024 len. 29]: And be sure to give me a catchy refrain -- something the people want to move their feet to at the end of the second verse -- see ?
Parsing [sent. 1025 len. 7]: Then the words must be domestic .
Parsing [sent. 1026 len. 22]: I want a song badly , to sing down Clapham way and places like that , for charities and subscription concerts .
Parsing [sent. 1027 len. 11]: Let me see -- something about children , I think .
Parsing [sent. 1028 len. 6]: Nothing fetches them like children !
Parsing [sent. 1029 len. 34]: First verses , major , ` Happily homeward the children go ; ' and about their little troubles , you know , and their little fears , little smiles , and little tears .
Parsing [sent. 1030 len. 2]: There !
Parsing [sent. 1031 len. 4]: that 's rhyme .
Parsing [sent. 1032 len. 8]: I believe I could write it myself .
Parsing [sent. 1033 len. 24]: Then comes the refrain -- a little swing to it , a little lilt -- the same words for the first two verses .
Parsing [sent. 1034 len. 9]: Oh , you know the kind of thing !
Parsing [sent. 1035 len. 19]: Something to make the mothers cry , and the papas rush off to buy the song next morning .
Parsing [sent. 1036 len. 7]: Nothing draws so well as children .
Parsing [sent. 1037 len. 46]: And you might change to the minor key at the third verse , and point a moral : we are all children , life 's a journey , and we shall grow tired , too , and fall asleep at the end of our day .
Parsing [sent. 1038 len. 2]: There !
Parsing [sent. 1039 len. 10]: Never say I did n't give you an idea .
Parsing [sent. 1040 len. 17]: You write that for me , and we 'll make a fortune out of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1041 len. 4]: `` Thank you .
Parsing [sent. 1042 len. 7]: Oh , how kind you are !
Parsing [sent. 1043 len. 5]: I see it exactly .
Parsing [sent. 1044 len. 7]: I 'll try my very beat .
Parsing [sent. 1045 len. 16]: It is so very , very good of you to give me the chance ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1046 len. 5]: Miss Caldecott yawned wearily .
Parsing [sent. 1047 len. 9]: `` So close , is n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1048 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 1049 len. 7]: `` I hate this muggy weather .
Parsing [sent. 1050 len. 17]: Some people say it 's good for the complexion , but I do n't believe it .
Parsing [sent. 1051 len. 7]: I use that new American powder .
Parsing [sent. 1052 len. 5]: Have you tried it ?
Parsing [sent. 1053 len. 5]: There 's the bell !
Parsing [sent. 1054 len. 7]: I expect it is the Elliotts .
Parsing [sent. 1055 len. 7]: They said they were coming . ''
Parsing [sent. 1056 len. 21]: `` Then perhaps we ought to -- We have stayed a long time already , '' said Philippa , rising .
Parsing [sent. 1057 len. 13]: `` Thank you so very much for seeing us at all . ''
Parsing [sent. 1058 len. 10]: `` Oh , wo n't you wait for tea ?
Parsing [sent. 1059 len. 66]: Good-bye , dear , '' cried Miss Caldecott all in one breath , and without waiting for a reply to her question ; and the sisters went out into the narrow passage , to squeeze their way post three tall , smartly dressed girls who were engaged in arranging their veils and pulling out their fringes before the little strip of mirror in the hat-stand .
Parsing [sent. 1060 len. 19]: They walked down the street in silence , turned the corner , and exchanged bright , amused glances .
Parsing [sent. 1061 len. 8]: `` Our first introduction into professional circles !
Parsing [sent. 1062 len. 8]: How very , very funny she was !
Parsing [sent. 1063 len. 14]: How many times did she call us ` dear , ' I wonder ?
Parsing [sent. 1064 len. 8]: Not very formidable , was she ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1065 len. 10]: `` But , oh , what a lovely voice !
Parsing [sent. 1066 len. 5]: So rich and full !
Parsing [sent. 1067 len. 44]: I suppose it is because she has not had a thorough musical education that she has n't come to the front , and because she is n't quite -- quite -- But it is a shame to criticise , '' cried loyal Hope .
Parsing [sent. 1068 len. 6]: `` How kind she was !
Parsing [sent. 1069 len. 13]: How perfectly sweet of her to ask me to write that song !
Parsing [sent. 1070 len. 12]: Phil , Phil , do n't you think I am fortunate !
Parsing [sent. 1071 len. 10]: Do n't you think it 's a good beginning ?
Parsing [sent. 1072 len. 27]: I have an idea for the song already , and she is almost sure to take it ; it is as good as a commission . ''
Parsing [sent. 1073 len. 41]: Philippa looked at the shining eyes , and could not endure to breathe discouragement ; but in her heart of hearts she reflected that she should be sorry indeed to place any reliance upon the promises of Miss Minnie Caldecott .
Parsing [sent. 1074 len. 3]: CHAPTER SEVEN .
Parsing [sent. 1075 len. 4]: A PRIVATE READING .
Parsing [sent. 1076 len. 51]: Theo was pressed into the service to write the words of the song for Miss Caldecott , and composed a graceful little ditty which was sufficiently touching even to the spinster mind , and might safely be trusted to melt the hearts of parents `` in the front rows . ''
Parsing [sent. 1077 len. 28]: The task kept her happy and occupied while waiting for the answer to her letter , and Mr Hammond was both prompt and kind in his reply .
Parsing [sent. 1078 len. 21]: `` I shall be happy to give what help I can to your father 's daughter , '' he wrote .
Parsing [sent. 1079 len. 26]: `` He always appeared to me to have a very special gift , and I regretted that he did not cultivate it to the full .
Parsing [sent. 1080 len. 35]: I hope that you have inherited his powers , but at the same time I feel it my duty to beg you to earnestly consider the matter before deciding on your life 's work .
Parsing [sent. 1081 len. 43]: Many young people seem to imagine that they can ` take up literature ' as they would typewriting or clerical work , which is a vast mistake , and it would be cruel to encourage you unless you possess the inherent qualifications .
Parsing [sent. 1082 len. 30]: Would it not be better for the aiding of my judgment if , before coming to see me , you forwarded some _ short _ MS for my perusal ?
Parsing [sent. 1083 len. 45]: The time at my disposal is limited , but I will contrive to read anything you send before , say , Monday next , when I shall be pleased to see you at any time that may be convenient between eleven and one . ''
Parsing [sent. 1084 len. 23]: The letter was read aloud at the breakfast-table , and the audience commented on it with the candour which distinguishes family conclaves .
Parsing [sent. 1085 len. 4]: `` Very sensible !
Parsing [sent. 1086 len. 6]: Short and to the point .
Parsing [sent. 1087 len. 12]: How can he tell what sort of rubbish you write ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1088 len. 3]: said Steve .
Parsing [sent. 1089 len. 12]: `` Hope you notice the dash under the ` short ' !
Parsing [sent. 1090 len. 9]: No chance for your novel , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 1091 len. 17]: He does n't see himself sitting down to read hundreds of pages of your appalling fist .
Parsing [sent. 1092 len. 8]: Grows more like lattice-work every day ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1093 len. 4]: Philippa cried severely .
Parsing [sent. 1094 len. 10]: `` I can just imagine what he is like !
Parsing [sent. 1095 len. 11]: A proper little person , with a shiny bald head .
Parsing [sent. 1096 len. 7]: Fancy writing love-scenes for his inspection !
Parsing [sent. 1097 len. 4]: My hat ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1098 len. 10]: and Madge lengthened her chin in an expressive grimace .
Parsing [sent. 1099 len. 15]: `` The worst of it is , I do n't know what to send .
Parsing [sent. 1100 len. 9]: I have nothing short that 's good enough .
Parsing [sent. 1101 len. 10]: It ought to be striking , arresting , original .
Parsing [sent. 1102 len. 32]: I -- I want an idea , '' cried poor Theo , staring frantically at the coffee-cups , and wrinkling her brow until she looked ten years older on the spot .
Parsing [sent. 1103 len. 12]: `` It 's finding a subject that is the hardest part .
Parsing [sent. 1104 len. 11]: I love the writing when I 'm once well started .
Parsing [sent. 1105 len. 11]: I ca n't possibly send anything before next week . ''
Parsing [sent. 1106 len. 5]: `` Do n't try .
Parsing [sent. 1107 len. 10]: Take your time , and do your very best .
Parsing [sent. 1108 len. 19]: Send a letter to say you will forward a MS in the course of the next few weeks .
Parsing [sent. 1109 len. 23]: It 's important that you should send your best work , and you ca n't write happily with a feeling of hurry .
Parsing [sent. 1110 len. 14]: It must be a story , of course , not an article . ''
Parsing [sent. 1111 len. 56]: `` Mind you have a nice hero : six feet high -- broad shoulders -- big moustache -- '' `` No , no ; clean shaven -- clean shaven , with a firm , determined chin ; big feet and hands , quick-tempered , but too sweet for anything to the girl he loves . ''
Parsing [sent. 1112 len. 33]: `` Make her slim and willowy , with grey eyes ; rather wistful-looking , not exactly pretty , but with ` a way with her ' that simply mows 'em down ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1113 len. 9]: `` Give her some spirit , mind ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1114 len. 5]: cried Madge once more .
Parsing [sent. 1115 len. 18]: `` I hate your mawkish heroines -- sort of creature you would call ` The Maiden . '
Parsing [sent. 1116 len. 87]: Do n't call her ` The Maiden , ' Theo , if you wish me to buy a copy ; and whatever you do , I pray and beseech you , do n't write in the present tense : ` I am leaning against a stile ; the roses are falling in heavy clusters by my side ; the rays of the sun are pouring on my uncovered head and turning to gold the wayward curls which refuse to lie straight despite all my efforts . '
Parsing [sent. 1117 len. 9]: Do n't you know the kind of thing !
Parsing [sent. 1118 len. 16]: I feel inclined to throw a book in the fire when it begins like that .
Parsing [sent. 1119 len. 13]: Do n't let your heroine have ` wayward curls , ' Theo .
Parsing [sent. 1120 len. 14]: Do n't let her have ` little tendrils wandering over her brow . '
Parsing [sent. 1121 len. 47]: Do n't say in every chapter that ` she had never looked more lovely ; ' and for goodness ' sake do n't let the husband and wife behave like idiots , and quarrel all the time , though they are really expiring of love ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1122 len. 5]: `` Well , really !
Parsing [sent. 1123 len. 4]: Any more instructions ?
Parsing [sent. 1124 len. 30]: It 's a pity you do n't write the whole thing while you are about it , '' said Theo testily as she pushed her choir from the table .
Parsing [sent. 1125 len. 20]: The family had grown to dread the times when Theo was settling on a plot for a new story .
Parsing [sent. 1126 len. 22]: She was so restless ; she wandered about in such an aimless manner ; she looked so thoroughly worried and unhappy .
Parsing [sent. 1127 len. 30]: Sometimes the girls would try to help her with suggestions , and then she would listen with a forbearing smile , and say , `` Oh , thank you !
Parsing [sent. 1128 len. 9]: Yes , it 's _ very _ good .
Parsing [sent. 1129 len. 23]: I should think a capital story might be made out of it , but somehow it does n't appeal to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1130 len. 39]: At other times , when they were never thinking of helping , and were engaged in what seemed the most ordinary conversation , Theo would suddenly clap her hands and cry , `` Oh , that will do !
Parsing [sent. 1131 len. 2]: Good !
Parsing [sent. 1132 len. 9]: _ Now _ I 've got it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1133 len. 26]: and rush excitedly from the room , leaving her sisters to discuss what in the world they had said that could possibly suggest a romance .
Parsing [sent. 1134 len. 16]: Verily , an author in the household was a difficult person with whom to deal !
Parsing [sent. 1135 len. 38]: For the next few days Theo sat alone in her room making futile efforts at a beginning , going out for long walks along the crowded streets , or sitting shivering on the seats in the Park .
Parsing [sent. 1136 len. 49]: In deference to her condition , Hope kept away from the piano while she was at home ; but no sooner was the door closed behind her than she flew to try the effect of the new song , and to alter and re-alter the more troublesome bars .
Parsing [sent. 1137 len. 27]: She must practise , too , for with the hope of public work before her it would never do to lose execution and flexibility of finger .
Parsing [sent. 1138 len. 17]: Already she was making arrangements for lessons in harmony , and her time seemed filling up .
Parsing [sent. 1139 len. 52]: In the energy which distinguishes all beginnings , Hope practised scales and exercises for a good three hours one Saturday afternoon , and towards the end of the time was much exercised to account for the meaning of a thumping noise that seemed to rise from the ground beneath her feet .
Parsing [sent. 1140 len. 9]: She stopped playing ; the noise stopped also .
Parsing [sent. 1141 len. 9]: She began again ; the noise was repeated .
Parsing [sent. 1142 len. 28]: Philippa , summoned to decide whether or no they were the proud possessors of a unique sort of echo , immediately arrived at a more prosaic explanation .
Parsing [sent. 1143 len. 9]: `` It 's some one knocking from underneath .
Parsing [sent. 1144 len. 14]: It must be the Hermit , that bachelor creature who lives just below .
Parsing [sent. 1145 len. 7]: He wants you to stop . ''
Parsing [sent. 1146 len. 5]: `` What cheek ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1147 len. 3]: cried Hope .
Parsing [sent. 1148 len. 44]: She was , as a rule , discreet and punctilious in her language , but there are points upon which the meekest among us are keenly sensitive , and when it came to interference with her practising , propriety flew to the winds .
Parsing [sent. 1149 len. 7]: `` What _ hateful _ cheek !
Parsing [sent. 1150 len. 7]: What right has he to interfere !
Parsing [sent. 1151 len. 7]: Has he hired the whole building ?
Parsing [sent. 1152 len. 16]: Does he think we are going to consult _ him _ about what we do ?
Parsing [sent. 1153 len. 5]: What next , indeed ?
Parsing [sent. 1154 len. 14]: I 'll try chromatics now , and see how he will like them .
Parsing [sent. 1155 len. 2]: Cheek !
Parsing [sent. 1156 len. 4]: Abominable cheek ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1157 len. 39]: She went to work more vigorously than ever , and Philippa thought it prudent to refrain from interference , but contented herself with hurrying preparations for tea ; and for the time being there was no more knocking .
Parsing [sent. 1158 len. 14]: Presumably the chromatics had reduced the listener to a condition of helpless despair .
Parsing [sent. 1159 len. 21]: On the third evening Theo made her appearance wearing her best fichu , and with a face wreathed in smiles .
Parsing [sent. 1160 len. 7]: `` I 've got it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1161 len. 15]: she announced ; and there was no need to ask to what she referred .
Parsing [sent. 1162 len. 22]: The tension was over for the time being , and the young author worked up her subject with the usual enjoyment .
Parsing [sent. 1163 len. 42]: When the story was finished the girls begged for a private reading ; a request against which , as a rule , the author steadily set her face , so that , as usual , the first response was a refusal .
Parsing [sent. 1164 len. 5]: `` I ca n't .
Parsing [sent. 1165 len. 5]: It is too cold-blooded .
Parsing [sent. 1166 len. 12]: The members of one 's own family are too painfully critical .
Parsing [sent. 1167 len. 13]: I 'd rather face a dozen editors than you three girls . ''
Parsing [sent. 1168 len. 21]: `` Very unkind of you , then ; that 's all I have to say , '' said Philippa severely .
Parsing [sent. 1169 len. 32]: `` You know how interested we are ; and if we _ are _ critical , surely it 's better to discuss faults with us than to let them go uncorrected .
Parsing [sent. 1170 len. 20]: This is a special story , and in consideration of our anxiety -- '' `` Oh , well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1171 len. 13]: said Theo unwillingly , `` I 'll read it if you like .
Parsing [sent. 1172 len. 14]: Get your sewing , and do n't stare at me all the time .
Parsing [sent. 1173 len. 5]: It 's quite short .
Parsing [sent. 1174 len. 9]: You wo n't like it , I expect .
Parsing [sent. 1175 len. 8]: Let me sit near the lamp . ''
Parsing [sent. 1176 len. 31]: She was evidently nervous , and her voice was decidedly shaky for the first few pages ; but after that she forgot herself , and read with expression and power .
Parsing [sent. 1177 len. 45]: If one of the girls moved , she looked up with a frown ; and when Madge groaned and clasped her hands over her heart at a particularly touching part of the love-story , she stopped short and fixed her with a basilisk glare .
Parsing [sent. 1178 len. 30]: It was a story of a truly modern type , which , so to speak , began at the end and worked slowly but surely back to the beginning .
Parsing [sent. 1179 len. 38]: It was by no means certain , too , what the heroine did , or why she did it ; and if one had been sceptically minded , one would have doubted whether the author knew herself .
Parsing [sent. 1180 len. 14]: Hope was puzzled , Madge engrossed and curious ; Philippa was frankly bored .
Parsing [sent. 1181 len. 21]: Her own nature was straightforward and outspoken , and she had no patience with what seemed to be wilful obtuseness .
Parsing [sent. 1182 len. 26]: Her attention waned as a Martha-like anxiety seized her in its grip ; her eyes wandered to the clock , and her brow grew furrowed .
Parsing [sent. 1183 len. 11]: Alas for the trials of the author in the household !
Parsing [sent. 1184 len. 60]: At the very moment when Theo was preparing to deliver the crucial sentence on which hung the whole construction of the plot -- in that thrilling moment wherein she paused and drew breath , the better to deliver it with due emphasis and dramatic effect -- an anxious voice claimed precedence and cried loudly : '' _ Hope _ !
Parsing [sent. 1185 len. 5]: It 's after five .
Parsing [sent. 1186 len. 11]: _ Did _ you remember to order the fish ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1187 len. 11]: It was too much for flesh and blood to endure .
Parsing [sent. 1188 len. 44]: Up bounced Theo ; down dashed the MS on the table ; bang went the door after her departing figure as she fled to her bedroom for refuge , while the two younger sisters stared across the room with eyes large with reproach .
Parsing [sent. 1189 len. 7]: `` Phil , how could you ?
Parsing [sent. 1190 len. 3]: How cruel !
Parsing [sent. 1191 len. 6]: At the most exciting point !
Parsing [sent. 1192 len. 9]: How _ could _ you do it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1193 len. 15]: `` I 'm sorry , '' said Philippa ; and she really looked it .
Parsing [sent. 1194 len. 27]: `` I did n't mean to vex her ; but Steve will be home in less than an hour , and there is only cold meat .
Parsing [sent. 1195 len. 8]: I was so anxious about the fish .
Parsing [sent. 1196 len. 7]: Was there much more to read ?
Parsing [sent. 1197 len. 17]: You might finish it , and then we can tell her what we think of it .
Parsing [sent. 1198 len. 10]: I do n't like it ; do you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1199 len. 10]: `` It 's clever , '' said Madge decidedly .
Parsing [sent. 1200 len. 6]: `` It 's atrociously clever .
Parsing [sent. 1201 len. 10]: I 'm dying to know how it ends . ''
Parsing [sent. 1202 len. 28]: But when the MS was finished Madge 's curiosity remained unsatisfied , for what happened to the heroine was as uncertain as everything else in her career .
Parsing [sent. 1203 len. 33]: Theo did not make her appearance again until dinner was on the table , when she came into the room with her head in the air and her lip curled in disdain .
Parsing [sent. 1204 len. 23]: `` I have to live with these poor , grovelling worms , but at least I need not associate with them ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1205 len. 11]: So said her expression as plainly as words could speak .
Parsing [sent. 1206 len. 46]: She had , however , reckoned without her sense of humour , which , fortunately for her readers , was particularly acute ; and no sooner was the cover removed from the belated fish than her lips began to twitch and her eyes to twinkle .
Parsing [sent. 1207 len. 48]: Her cheeks grew red , her shoulders heaved , and finally out came a great burst of laughter ; and there she sat , rocking to and fro in her chair , gasping out short , strangled sentences , with her hands gripped convulsively over her heart .
Parsing [sent. 1208 len. 3]: `` Oh-h !
Parsing [sent. 1209 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 1210 len. 6]: Have you ordered the fish ?
Parsing [sent. 1211 len. 5]: The _ fish _ !
Parsing [sent. 1212 len. 14]: Oh , a prophet -- is not a prophet -- _ Fish _ !
Parsing [sent. 1213 len. 3]: Oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1214 len. 16]: `` Might make a joke somehow about fish and Jonah , might n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1215 len. 22]: said Madge , laughing , scarcely less heartily , in the relief of seeing Theo 's descent from her high horse .
Parsing [sent. 1216 len. 18]: `` I ca n't quite see how it is to be done , but it has possibilities .
Parsing [sent. 1217 len. 17]: I finished reading your story , my dear , and I feel inclined to shake you .
Parsing [sent. 1218 len. 15]: Why could n't you make a happy ending while you were about it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1219 len. 5]: `` Too commonplace ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1220 len. 5]: said the author scornfully .
Parsing [sent. 1221 len. 19]: `` You did n't expect me to make them ` live happily ever after , ' did you ?
Parsing [sent. 1222 len. 11]: I have n't quite descended to that , I hope .
Parsing [sent. 1223 len. 10]: Well , what do you think of it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1224 len. 15]: `` I do n't like it nearly so well as some of your others .
Parsing [sent. 1225 len. 28]: I was sorry that I interrupted you , dear ; but I am afraid it was because I did n't like it , '' confessed Philippa honestly .
Parsing [sent. 1226 len. 21]: `` I loved that pretty little story about the poor governess and the rich lover who came home from Australia .
Parsing [sent. 1227 len. 15]: Do send that to Mr Hammond ; it is really very much nicer . ''
Parsing [sent. 1228 len. 4]: `` Nicer ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1229 len. 3]: repeated Theo .
Parsing [sent. 1230 len. 4]: `` Pretty ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1231 len. 8]: Her voice rang with an incredulous disdain .
Parsing [sent. 1232 len. 8]: `` I want something strong and powerful .
Parsing [sent. 1233 len. 9]: Hope , what do _ you _ think ?
Parsing [sent. 1234 len. 8]: Do n't you like it either ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1235 len. 11]: Hope wrinkled her brows , and looked puzzled and distressed .
Parsing [sent. 1236 len. 6]: `` I ca n't decide .
Parsing [sent. 1237 len. 5]: It 's so queer !
Parsing [sent. 1238 len. 22]: Does it really mean that she marries him in the end , or that she refuses him because she loves him ?
Parsing [sent. 1239 len. 13]: I keep thinking and thinking , and it is so confusing . ''
Parsing [sent. 1240 len. 46]: `` It is the most maddening story I ever read , '' chimed in Madge decisively , `` for it tells you nothing that you want to know , and it makes you want to know so much that you can hardly live for suspense .
Parsing [sent. 1241 len. 21]: You ought to hate that exasperating girl , and yet you feel that life is not worth living without her .
Parsing [sent. 1242 len. 24]: I will say for you , my dear , that you have achieved the most worrying , unsatisfactory muddle I can possibly imagine .
Parsing [sent. 1243 len. 10]: I believe I shall dream of it to-night . ''
Parsing [sent. 1244 len. 4]: `` Hurrah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1245 len. 7]: cried Theo -- `` hurrah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1246 len. 19]: and she tossed her bread in the air , and caught it again with a wave of triumph .
Parsing [sent. 1247 len. 7]: `` I _ am _ pleased !
Parsing [sent. 1248 len. 15]: I wo n't alter a single word , but will send it off to-night .
Parsing [sent. 1249 len. 29]: If Hope keeps worrying about it while she is awake , and Madge dreams of it while she is asleep , I do n't want any higher praise .
Parsing [sent. 1250 len. 24]: Never mind if the impression is painful ; it _ is _ an impression , and that 's the great object of story-telling .
Parsing [sent. 1251 len. 4]: Thank you both .
Parsing [sent. 1252 len. 6]: I 'm so relieved . ''
Parsing [sent. 1253 len. 4]: `` Humph ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1254 len. 34]: muttered Philippa shortly , and added something under her breath about `` executions making a painful impression , if you come to that ; '' which the others judiciously affected not to hear .
Parsing [sent. 1255 len. 53]: Phil had her own grievance by this time , for it is not pleasant to have one 's criticisms overlooked as beneath consideration , and to be calmly ignored by artistic striplings as a good , commonplace creature who can not be expected to rise to the intellectual level of her companions .
Parsing [sent. 1256 len. 44]: Like all housekeepers , Philippa experienced moments of weariness and revolt against the everlasting `` trivial round '' -- moments of longing for a more interesting life-work -- and at such times the attitude of her younger sisters made her lot doubly hard .
Parsing [sent. 1257 len. 31]: She struggled against the temptation to say something sharp and cutting , and Stephen , watching her face from the other end of the table , divined the hidden thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 1258 len. 61]: He was not a brilliant nor , to outsiders , a particularly interesting young fellow , but just one of those kindly , single-hearted men who are born to make some woman 's life safe and happy ; and as , so far , Philippa was his lady-love , he could not rest while that shadow was on her brow .
Parsing [sent. 1259 len. 35]: Before they went to bed he made an excuse to call her into the dining-room , and to lead the conversation in such a direction as would invite her to give him her confidence .
Parsing [sent. 1260 len. 12]: `` It is a little hard , is n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1261 len. 4]: she said wistfully .
Parsing [sent. 1262 len. 18]: `` You saw how Theo ignored my criticism , and the others never even seemed to notice .
Parsing [sent. 1263 len. 34]: I work for them all day long , keeping the house comfortable and mending their things , to set them free for their own work , and I am only despised for it .
Parsing [sent. 1264 len. 18]: It makes me mad , Steve ; and , worse still , it makes me sad . ''
Parsing [sent. 1265 len. 6]: `` Poor old girl ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1266 len. 4]: said Stephen softly .
Parsing [sent. 1267 len. 13]: He leant his elbows on the mantelpiece and ruffled his hair nervously .
Parsing [sent. 1268 len. 47]: If Philippa had been his wife he would have taken her in his arms and spoken all that was in his heart , but a man feels an embarrassment in `` letting himself go '' before a sister not known in the nearer and dearer relationship .
Parsing [sent. 1269 len. 42]: He wanted to say that the woman who makes a home has achieved a greater and nobler work than the one who produces a mere book or picture , and that in his eyes at least she is first and best .
Parsing [sent. 1270 len. 21]: But he had a horror of appearing sentimental , and what he really said was : `` Horribly bad form !
Parsing [sent. 1271 len. 4]: Upsetting young cubs !
Parsing [sent. 1272 len. 26]: They will get a little of the starch knocked out of them when they find what a poor place they take among the rest . ''
Parsing [sent. 1273 len. 9]: `` Oh , I do n't want that !
Parsing [sent. 1274 len. 24]: I want them to succeed , '' cried Philippa quickly ; and then she began to laugh and to look herself once more .
Parsing [sent. 1275 len. 28]: `` We are like a nice , prosaic old father and mother , Steve , whose children are so alarmingly clever that we are half-afraid of them .
Parsing [sent. 1276 len. 9]: I am glad you are ordinary like myself .
Parsing [sent. 1277 len. 18]: You would n't be half such a strength to me if you were a genius too . ''
Parsing [sent. 1278 len. 6]: `` Poor old girl ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1279 len. 17]: said Stephen again , and let his hand drop on her shoulder with a helpful grip .
Parsing [sent. 1280 len. 38]: He did not say that she could trust him to stand by her always , and to uphold her in every difficulty , but she understood the unspoken promise , and went to bed soothed and comforted .
Parsing [sent. 1281 len. 34]: Theo 's MS was posted to Mr Hammond , and in due course an answer was received containing no reference to the story , but simply naming an hour for the proposed interview .
Parsing [sent. 1282 len. 28]: The young author tried to read signs of increased deference and respect for her attainments between the lines , but even her optimism failed in the attempt .
Parsing [sent. 1283 len. 28]: She grew nervous as the time approached , and looked decidedly pale as she partook of a strengthening cup of cocoa before dressing for the important expedition .
Parsing [sent. 1284 len. 9]: `` What are you going to wear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1285 len. 12]: Madge inquired , and the author curled her lip in disdain .
Parsing [sent. 1286 len. 7]: `` My dear , how ridiculous !
Parsing [sent. 1287 len. 5]: As if it mattered !
Parsing [sent. 1288 len. 24]: Do you suppose for one moment that it will make any difference to Mr Hammond whether I look charming or a perfect fright !
Parsing [sent. 1289 len. 26]: Are you so innocent as to believe that he would accept a story that he did n't like from the greatest beauty on earth ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1290 len. 4]: `` Humph ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1291 len. 4]: said Madge reflectively .
Parsing [sent. 1292 len. 9]: `` The heart of man is desperately wicked !
Parsing [sent. 1293 len. 20]: Not _ that _ story , perhaps , but he would be much more willing to look at another .
Parsing [sent. 1294 len. 9]: Take my advice and put on your toque .
Parsing [sent. 1295 len. 15]: A girl never loses anything by making herself attractive when dealing with a man .
Parsing [sent. 1296 len. 25]: I have never met any editors , but I have reason to suppose that they are not different from the rest of mankind . ''
Parsing [sent. 1297 len. 6]: `` Nineteen , and country-bred !
Parsing [sent. 1298 len. 12]: Where did your worldly wisdom come from , my dear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1299 len. 10]: cried Theo , holding up her hands in astonishment .
Parsing [sent. 1300 len. 30]: But she wore her toque all the same , and took off her veil three times over because one little curl refused to lie exactly in the right place .
Parsing [sent. 1301 len. 16]: She desired , above all things , to arouse Mr Hammond 's interest and sympathy .
Parsing [sent. 1302 len. 9]: The first visit to a publisher 's office !
Parsing [sent. 1303 len. 24]: It was a nervous occasion , and Theo walked once , twice , thrice past the dreaded door before summoning courage to enter .
Parsing [sent. 1304 len. 47]: A board on the wall informed her that she must mount to the third story , so she raised her skirts , ascended a narrow and not too clean staircase , and stood outside a door labelled `` Office , '' wondering what to do next .
Parsing [sent. 1305 len. 18]: Neither knocker nor bell was to be seen ; what , then , was she to do ?
Parsing [sent. 1306 len. 34]: If she tapped on the pane and waited for the door to be opened , she would appear humble and amateurish ; if she entered unannounced , it would seem bold and presumptuous .
Parsing [sent. 1307 len. 59]: She determined to err rather on the side of overrating her own importance , hoping thereby to prove the truth of the old adage ; so , turning the handle with a firm hand , she walked into the office , and found herself confronted by -- a small and shabby boy , perched on a high stool !
Parsing [sent. 1308 len. 7]: All this fuss about a child !
Parsing [sent. 1309 len. 42]: Theo 's indignation lent an added haughtiness to her manner as she demanded to see the editor of the _ Casket _ , and Jack-in-office stared at her curiously , up and down , down and up , before he replied .
Parsing [sent. 1310 len. 32]: His expression seemed to imply that he had seen her like before , and that he more than suspected a MS tied with blue ribbon was hidden skilfully beneath her coat .
Parsing [sent. 1311 len. 7]: `` Have you an appointment ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1312 len. 45]: he asked severely ; and though Theo affected a smile of superiority , she felt an inward conviction that without that same appointment she would have been compelled to make her way to Mr Hammond 's presence over the dead body of his vassal .
Parsing [sent. 1313 len. 47]: As it was , he carried away her card , and came back almost immediately to escort her to the editor 's room , where he pointed to a chair , and remarked encouragingly that Mr Hammond would be disengaged in a few minutes ' time .
Parsing [sent. 1314 len. 39]: Theo threw a glance at her reflection in a dusty mirror , and seated herself with much the same tremulous sinking of heart as that with which she was accustomed to settle herself in the dentist 's chair .
Parsing [sent. 1315 len. 30]: On the desk before her lay a litter of papers and proofs ; her eye fell absently on the slip nearest to herself , and lightened into eager interest .
Parsing [sent. 1316 len. 34]: Here was a treat indeed , for what she saw was the next month 's instalment of a powerful serial as to the termination of which the sisters had frequently and hotly debated .
Parsing [sent. 1317 len. 26]: A sentence here , a sentence there , gave the needed clues , and she smiled with mischievous delight at the advantage she had gained .
Parsing [sent. 1318 len. 27]: That evening she would lead the conversation to the Count and his lady , and would give graphic prophecies of the next stage in their adventures .
Parsing [sent. 1319 len. 23]: Even the conversations she would foretell , so that when the new number arrived her character of wizard would be fully established .
Parsing [sent. 1320 len. 27]: The interesting prospect dispelled her nervousness , and she was smiling to herself in bright , natural fashion when the door opened and Mr Hammond appeared .
Parsing [sent. 1321 len. 30]: The editor was short and dark , middle-aged , and carelessly dressed ; an undignified little figure , on whom the literary aspirant looked with instant lightening of heart .
Parsing [sent. 1322 len. 47]: `` I 'm not afraid of _ him _ , '' she told herself ; but the thought was no sooner formed than revoked ; for Mr Hammond spoke , and at the first sound of his voice he became aloof , formidable -- a personage !
Parsing [sent. 1323 len. 46]: He greeted the girl kindly enough , but Theo felt strangely humbled as she faced him , and realised with painful clearness that she was a girl , a tyro , and that this man was accustomed to associate with the master-minds of his day .
Parsing [sent. 1324 len. 24]: Her complacency about the `` worrying '' story fell from her like a cloak , and she awaited his verdict with sickening suspense .
Parsing [sent. 1325 len. 17]: `` It is kind of you to see me ; I know you are very busy .
Parsing [sent. 1326 len. 12]: I sent you a MS , as you asked for one .
Parsing [sent. 1327 len. 8]: I suppose you -- received it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1328 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1329 len. 17]: Mr Hammond 's face gave no clue as to his opinion of the masterpiece in question .
Parsing [sent. 1330 len. 18]: `` I am pleased to see you , and to give you any help in my power .
Parsing [sent. 1331 len. 16]: As I said in my note , I had a great admiration for your father .
Parsing [sent. 1332 len. 16]: And so you have determined to settle in town and enter the great arena ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1333 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 1334 len. 11]: We are very poor , and must work for ourselves .
Parsing [sent. 1335 len. 36]: I have been writing for my own amusement ever since I was a child , and if it were possible to make a livelihood in that way I should like it better than anything else .
Parsing [sent. 1336 len. 16]: I would rather live on half the money and do the work I love . ''
Parsing [sent. 1337 len. 18]: She looked appealingly at the impassive face , but no approval of her prospective renunciation was forthcoming .
Parsing [sent. 1338 len. 25]: Mr Hammond merely bent his head in grave assent and remarked : `` Literature is a good crutch , but a very inefficient staff .
Parsing [sent. 1339 len. 31]: If you have no private means , and are seeking for a profession which is to be your entire support , you would be wiser to go in for millinery .
Parsing [sent. 1340 len. 10]: Brain-work is uncertain , trying , and badly paid .
Parsing [sent. 1341 len. 17]: Even at the best an author 's spell of popularity is short-lived in these degenerate days .
Parsing [sent. 1342 len. 20]: A new writer comes along with a fresh trick , and the old friend is promptly forgotten and despised .
Parsing [sent. 1343 len. 27]: For the sake of L.S.D. he is compelled to write twice as much as he ought to do , and so dooms himself even more completely .
Parsing [sent. 1344 len. 23]: In millinery , I should suppose , experience adds to capacity , and the demand for bonnets is a happy certainty . ''
Parsing [sent. 1345 len. 14]: This time it was the editor who smiled and Theo who was unresponsive .
Parsing [sent. 1346 len. 14]: She was deeply offended , and hope had sunk to the lowest ebb .
Parsing [sent. 1347 len. 22]: Surely if Mr Hammond had found any merit in her story he would not have humiliated her by such a suggestion .
Parsing [sent. 1348 len. 12]: She lowered her eyes , and trifled nervously with her furs .
Parsing [sent. 1349 len. 18]: `` Then you think -- after reading my story -- you think I have no chance ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1350 len. 9]: `` No ; I do n't say that .
Parsing [sent. 1351 len. 10]: That depends entirely upon -- '' `` Yes ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1352 len. 11]: Mr Hammond looked at her with a kindly pity . ''
Parsing [sent. 1353 len. 11]: _ Upon how much heart-breaking you can stand _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1354 len. 4]: he said solemnly .
Parsing [sent. 1355 len. 52]: `` The apprenticeship which you will have to serve is weeks , months -- it may be even years -- of steady , persistent , unsuccessful work ; weary disappointment after weary disappointment ; nothing to show for your labour but a drawer full of dog-eared papers which nobody will accept .
Parsing [sent. 1356 len. 39]: Realise what it means , and ask yourself if you have strength to bear it ; if you have sufficient courage and self-confidence to work on undaunted , and find fresh inspiration in the midst of defeat . ''
Parsing [sent. 1357 len. 19]: He looked at her gravely , and Theo lifted her head and returned the look with flashing eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1358 len. 14]: `` If I had the prospect of success in the end -- yes !
Parsing [sent. 1359 len. 6]: a hundred times , yes !
Parsing [sent. 1360 len. 6]: I am not a child .
Parsing [sent. 1361 len. 12]: I do n't expect to make a name in a day .
Parsing [sent. 1362 len. 17]: You can judge better than I. Is there a chance for me if I work hard ?
Parsing [sent. 1363 len. 9]: Have I a gift which is worth cultivating ?
Parsing [sent. 1364 len. 17]: You promised to tell me the truth , and I ask it of you now . ''
Parsing [sent. 1365 len. 13]: Then for the first time Mr Hammond gave a hint of encouragement .
Parsing [sent. 1366 len. 21]: He smiled whimsically , as at an amusing recollection , and studied the girl 's face with a new interest .
Parsing [sent. 1367 len. 9]: `` Oh yes ; you have the faculty .
Parsing [sent. 1368 len. 12]: It is there ; there is no doubt it is there .
Parsing [sent. 1369 len. 24]: I read your story , and with all its faults it escapes the two unpardonable crimes -- it is neither dull nor commonplace .
Parsing [sent. 1370 len. 34]: I do n't pretend to say that you will be a great writer , but when you have learned your trade you will probably be able to place your stories with little difficulty .
Parsing [sent. 1371 len. 24]: Study style ; study the best masters ; do n't think any time wasted that is given to cultivating pure , forcible English .
Parsing [sent. 1372 len. 21]: Study the people around you , and write of what you _ know _ , not of what you imagine .
Parsing [sent. 1373 len. 23]: It is difficult to describe an emotion which one has never felt , or a life in which one has no part .
Parsing [sent. 1374 len. 24]: Study the magazines also , and note what style is adopted by each , the length of story taken , and so on .
Parsing [sent. 1375 len. 21]: These things are but the technicalities of the profession , but the mastery of them will save you needless disappointments .
Parsing [sent. 1376 len. 35]: When a MS is returned for the sixth time , put it away for a month , then read it over in a critical spirit , and try to discover wherein the fault lies .
Parsing [sent. 1377 len. 13]: A little altering and rewriting may make it a marketable article . ''
Parsing [sent. 1378 len. 8]: `` Y-es , '' said Theo faintly .
Parsing [sent. 1379 len. 44]: That `` sixth time '' fell sadly on her ear , for it was one thing to assert that she did not expect to win in a day , and quite another to hear repeated failure predicted in that cool , unemotional fashion .
Parsing [sent. 1380 len. 55]: She wondered if Mr Hammond would refer to her story in any more definite fashion , and seeing that he began to play with the papers on his desk , as if to intimate that the `` five minutes '' were drawing to a close , she summoned courage to put a direct question .
Parsing [sent. 1381 len. 17]: `` And the MS that I sent you , Mr Hammond -- was it pretty good ?
Parsing [sent. 1382 len. 57]: Do you think it suitable for -- er -- for -- '' Her courage failed as he looked up in grave inquiry , and she dared not say `` the _ Casket _ , '' as she had intended ; but Mr Hammond finished her sentence , as if he had not divined the unspoken word .
Parsing [sent. 1383 len. 3]: `` Publication !
Parsing [sent. 1384 len. 8]: There would be no harm in trying .
Parsing [sent. 1385 len. 16]: I have read many less interesting stories , though it bears the mark of inexperience .
Parsing [sent. 1386 len. 25]: Try some of the smaller papers , like the _ Companion _ ; and , if necessary , cut it down to their length .
Parsing [sent. 1387 len. 11]: I have it here in this drawer , I think .
Parsing [sent. 1388 len. 5]: Yes -- thank you .
Parsing [sent. 1389 len. 7]: Pleased to have seen you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1390 len. 9]: Theo rose to her feet a-smart with mortification .
Parsing [sent. 1391 len. 37]: To be recommended to the _ Companion _ , and advised to cut down her masterpiece for the approval of its twopenny-halfpenny editor , was humiliation indeed for the would-be contributor to the _ Casket _ .
Parsing [sent. 1392 len. 28]: She followed Mr Hammond to the door , and held out her hand in silence , her only desire being to end the painful interview at once .
Parsing [sent. 1393 len. 25]: But the smitten look on the young face , the sudden collapse of the former audacious complacency , were too marked to pass unnoticed .
Parsing [sent. 1394 len. 36]: The editor looked at her , and recalled his own youth , when a kind word was as a magic wand , and a harsh one shut the door so hopelessly against a cherished dream .
Parsing [sent. 1395 len. 8]: He gave her hand an encouraging pressure .
Parsing [sent. 1396 len. 13]: `` You have the stuff in you ; you have the stuff !
Parsing [sent. 1397 len. 24]: Work hard , and when you have served your apprenticeship come back to me , and I 'll help you all I can .
Parsing [sent. 1398 len. 12]: Send me one MS in three months -- one , remember .
Parsing [sent. 1399 len. 11]: If you send more I sha 'n' t read them .
Parsing [sent. 1400 len. 15]: When one is accepted you will have reached the first rung of the ladder .
Parsing [sent. 1401 len. 7]: No , do n't thank me !
Parsing [sent. 1402 len. 24]: I will accept nothing from you , nor from any one else , that does not deserve a place on its own merits .
Parsing [sent. 1403 len. 3]: Good-morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 1404 len. 22]: His eyes fell on the roll of paper in her hand , and he pointed to it with an outstretched finger .
Parsing [sent. 1405 len. 16]: `` Do n't -- er -- do n't overdo it , '' he said meaningly .
Parsing [sent. 1406 len. 10]: `` Do n't try to be too clever . ''
Parsing [sent. 1407 len. 14]: Then the door shut , and Theo groped her way down the stairs .
Parsing [sent. 1408 len. 15]: Her cheeks were crimson ; she beat the banisters savagely with the paper roll .
Parsing [sent. 1409 len. 15]: Jack-in-office looked out of his open door and grinned to himself in amused understanding .
Parsing [sent. 1410 len. 11]: He had seen `` them '' look like that before .
Parsing [sent. 1411 len. 3]: CHAPTER EIGHT .
Parsing [sent. 1412 len. 3]: VISITORS ARRIVE .
Parsing [sent. 1413 len. 20]: Theo 's pride made her represent the interview with Mr Hammond in its most favourable light to her sisters .
Parsing [sent. 1414 len. 34]: He was satisfied that she had the makings of a successful author , was anxious to consider MSS from time to time , and had suggested a likely home for the present story .
Parsing [sent. 1415 len. 28]: The future , in fact , was assured , but a period of probation must necessarily elapse while she served what he called her `` apprenticeship . ''
Parsing [sent. 1416 len. 45]: The girls appeared duly impressed , and Theo felt with satisfaction that this verdict from a high authority would go far towards procuring for her that respect and admiration which it is so difficult to obtain from the members of one 's own family .
Parsing [sent. 1417 len. 27]: `` He advises me to read a great deal , to study the styles of the best masters , and to write only what I know .
Parsing [sent. 1418 len. 8]: I think that is rather a mistake .
Parsing [sent. 1419 len. 34]: If one possesses the literary instinct , it must surely be possible to project one 's self , as it were , into the place of another , and so create an environment .
Parsing [sent. 1420 len. 16]: How can one be expected to experience personally the whole gamut of human emotions ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1421 len. 24]: `` Cast your ruminating eye upon me , my love , '' said Madge suavely , pointing with a thin forefinger to herself .
Parsing [sent. 1422 len. 59]: Behind Theo 's back she had been occupied in rolling her eyes and waving her hands in dramatic illustration of the other 's high-flown phrases , so that Hope had rushed to the window to stare at the chimney-pots , while Philippa had dropped her needle on the floor and grovelled on all-fours in order to redeem it .
Parsing [sent. 1423 len. 22]: The two returned to their seats with expressions of preternatural gravity , while Madge continued to declaim her offers of help .
Parsing [sent. 1424 len. 5]: `` Study my character !
Parsing [sent. 1425 len. 9]: It is full of rich and unexpected qualities .
Parsing [sent. 1426 len. 26]: When you get to an _ impasse _ , ask my advice , and I 'll tell you how I should behave in the circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 1427 len. 23]: Though young in years I am old in wisdom , and you would go far before you discovered a better preceptor . ''
Parsing [sent. 1428 len. 6]: Theo laughed with good-natured disdain .
Parsing [sent. 1429 len. 7]: `` Old in experience , indeed !
Parsing [sent. 1430 len. 12]: Poor little country mouse , what do you know of life ?
Parsing [sent. 1431 len. 9]: You have never even been in love . ''
Parsing [sent. 1432 len. 9]: `` Oh , have n't I , though !
Parsing [sent. 1433 len. 11]: Shows how little you know , '' cried Madge darkly .
Parsing [sent. 1434 len. 15]: `` I have never been out of it since I was eight years old .
Parsing [sent. 1435 len. 7]: The first one was Tommy Egerton .
Parsing [sent. 1436 len. 13]: Do you remember those Egertons who took The Chase for a year ?
Parsing [sent. 1437 len. 21]: Tommy was the little boy who wore a fawn coat with a sealskin collar , and dear little brown gaiters .
Parsing [sent. 1438 len. 5]: I doted on him !
Parsing [sent. 1439 len. 18]: And one day his mother brought him to call , and I had on a soiled pinafore .
Parsing [sent. 1440 len. 5]: Oh , my feelings !
Parsing [sent. 1441 len. 18]: I consider that my character has been warped for life by the humiliation I endured that afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 1442 len. 34]: Then there was that freckled boy who used to send me valentines : -- `` The rose is red , the violet blue , And sugar 's sweet , and so are you .
Parsing [sent. 1443 len. 21]: `` Dear , dear , how bashful I felt the first time I met him after that special valentine arrived !
Parsing [sent. 1444 len. 13]: Then there was the curate who spoke through his ` dose . '
Parsing [sent. 1445 len. 10]: That was the love that was born of pity !
Parsing [sent. 1446 len. 28]: Every one abused him , so there arose in my heart that almost maternal tenderness and compassion which is inseparable from the love of every good woman .
Parsing [sent. 1447 len. 3]: Ahem ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1448 len. 27]: Madge glanced up with dancing eyes , then grew grave again and added slowly , `` And now there 's that student at the Slade School .
Parsing [sent. 1449 len. 17]: I asked him some questions the other day , and he was _ so _ kind !
Parsing [sent. 1450 len. 6]: He has a lovely chin .
Parsing [sent. 1451 len. 8]: I expect we shall be great friends .
Parsing [sent. 1452 len. 9]: Look at Philippa growing pale with anxiety . ''
Parsing [sent. 1453 len. 12]: `` It 's all very well , '' cried Philippa irritably .
Parsing [sent. 1454 len. 25]: `` I like young men myself , and wish we knew many more than we do , but we _ must _ be careful .
Parsing [sent. 1455 len. 28]: I hope you girls will not make any friends until you have had time to judge whether they are the sort of people we ought to know .
Parsing [sent. 1456 len. 7]: I do n't want to preach .
Parsing [sent. 1457 len. 4]: I hate preaching .
Parsing [sent. 1458 len. 35]: It is very hard to be in the position when it falls to me to say all the disagreeable things , but , situated as we are , we can hardly be too particular .
Parsing [sent. 1459 len. 33]: We want to make friends who will be a help to us , not a hindrance , and whose influence can never be hurtful to Barney when he is with us . ''
Parsing [sent. 1460 len. 40]: The mention of Barney brought a smile to each face , followed by sighs of anxiety , for it was impossible not to realise that the reckless , high-spirited boy would be a care as well as a pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 1461 len. 33]: Stephen was already looking out for a suitable opening in the City , and , with Philippa 's consent , had written to Mr Loftus to ask his assistance in the search .
Parsing [sent. 1462 len. 44]: As an influential shareholder in many large concerns it was likely that he would be able to find a situation , and his kindness of heart made it seem probable that he would put himself to some trouble on the boy 's behalf .
Parsing [sent. 1463 len. 50]: So far no letter had been received in reply ; but one afternoon about five o'clock the electric bell sounded through the little flat , and Hope ran to open the door to save trouble to the one small servant who was wrestling with preparations for the evening meal .
Parsing [sent. 1464 len. 54]: She thought it might possibly be the postman with a letter from Miss Caldecott to say how delighted she was with the new song ; but instead she found herself confronted by two life-size fashion-plates and , hidden away behind flowing skirts and ruffling chiffons , one small and dejected lord of creation !
Parsing [sent. 1465 len. 4]: The Loftus trio !
Parsing [sent. 1466 len. 93]: Aunt Loftus come to pay her first call , on the very occasion when Mary had set fire to the pretty lampshade , so that the smell of burning pervaded the air , and a naked `` chimney '' took the place of rosy frills ; when Philippa had felt too tired to change her morning-blouse , and naughty Madge had taken advantage of an idle hour to wash her hair , and was even now stretched before the fire in all the glory of a dressing-gown too old to be spoiled !
Parsing [sent. 1467 len. 35]: Hope was speechless with consternation , but with the drawing-room distant about two yards from the front-door escape was hopeless , and she was obliged to introduce the visitors with what composure she might .
Parsing [sent. 1468 len. 31]: To the credit of their breeding , be it said , Philippa and Madge rose nobly to the occasion , and welcomed the unwelcome guests without either apology or confusion .
Parsing [sent. 1469 len. 31]: Madge smiled sweetly through her wisps of hair , and discussed the weather in orthodox fashion , before sailing out of the room to clothe herself in more suitable attire .
Parsing [sent. 1470 len. 35]: Hope was proud of her sisters , and unselfishly annoyed that she should appear to better advantage than they ; for she had dressed early after her return from a wet and tiring walk .
Parsing [sent. 1471 len. 18]: She met her cousin 's curious gaze , and sat down beside her with a friendly smile .
Parsing [sent. 1472 len. 5]: `` You are Avice .
Parsing [sent. 1473 len. 9]: I have so often wondered about you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1474 len. 5]: `` You are Hope .
Parsing [sent. 1475 len. 11]: I have a picture of you as a little girl .
Parsing [sent. 1476 len. 5]: It is so pretty !
Parsing [sent. 1477 len. 8]: You have n't changed a bit . ''
Parsing [sent. 1478 len. 9]: `` Oh , oh , you should n't !
Parsing [sent. 1479 len. 10]: But how nice of you , all the same !
Parsing [sent. 1480 len. 18]: I love compliments , '' confessed pretty Hope , blushing in bewitching fashion between gratification and embarrassment .
Parsing [sent. 1481 len. 18]: She looked at Avice in her turn , and decided that she was not at all pretty .
Parsing [sent. 1482 len. 7]: But , oh , what clothes !
Parsing [sent. 1483 len. 7]: What a dream of a hat !
Parsing [sent. 1484 len. 11]: What distracting ruffles and laces peeping from between the sables !
Parsing [sent. 1485 len. 7]: What twinkling lights of diamond brooches !
Parsing [sent. 1486 len. 34]: She paused for a moment to do obeisance before a vision of herself clad in similar garments , then continued , with a smile , `` I am so glad to meet you !
Parsing [sent. 1487 len. 24]: It feels lonely to be absolutely without friends in this great London , and so far we know no one at all . ''
Parsing [sent. 1488 len. 12]: `` You are the musical one , are n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1489 len. 4]: Avice asked curiously .
Parsing [sent. 1490 len. 19]: `` You are all geniuses , father says , and determined to make a name in the world .
Parsing [sent. 1491 len. 5]: Have you begun work ?
Parsing [sent. 1492 len. 8]: What have you done so far ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1493 len. 6]: Hope smiled with pardonable satisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 1494 len. 14]: `` Well , really , I think we have made a good start .
Parsing [sent. 1495 len. 24]: Theo has interviewed one of the most influential editors in Fleet Street , and has been asked to send MSS to his paper .
Parsing [sent. 1496 len. 23]: Madge has sent in her two show-pictures to the Slade School , and is to begin regular work there at the half-term .
Parsing [sent. 1497 len. 27]: Meantime she is studying the different exhibitions and collections , and , as she says , picking up ` quite valuable hints ' from old masters .
Parsing [sent. 1498 len. 5]: She is so amusing !
Parsing [sent. 1499 len. 12]: She comes home every evening with absurd accounts of her adventures .
Parsing [sent. 1500 len. 50]: Most people would find it rather dull spending a whole day at the National Gallery , for instance , but Madge has the faculty of finding amusement wherever she goes , and , even apart from the pictures , has a dozen little histories and romances to recount . ''
Parsing [sent. 1501 len. 8]: `` Y-es , '' assented Avice flatly .
Parsing [sent. 1502 len. 48]: She herself had little sense of humour , and was by no means prepossessed by the plain , elf-like figure of her youngest cousin Hope , on the contrary , was graceful and charming , and had been already mentally adopted as the friend of the future .
Parsing [sent. 1503 len. 9]: `` What are _ you _ doing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1504 len. 29]: she asked , with an interest which could not fail to be flattering , and Hope moved her chair a trifle closer with an impulse of girlish confidence .
Parsing [sent. 1505 len. 10]: `` Oh , I am getting on so well !
Parsing [sent. 1506 len. 18]: I have had my first lesson in harmony , and my master is so kind and encouraging .
Parsing [sent. 1507 len. 19]: He seems to think that I know a great deal already , and his work is so interesting .
Parsing [sent. 1508 len. 23]: In the mornings I study and practise , and in the afternoons I try to hear as much music as I can .
Parsing [sent. 1509 len. 21]: I go to cheap seats at concerts and recitals , or to service at the Abbey or Saint Paul 's .
Parsing [sent. 1510 len. 3]: And fancy !
Parsing [sent. 1511 len. 28]: I have had a commission to write a song for a professional -- a real professional -- a lady who sings at concerts all over the country .
Parsing [sent. 1512 len. 11]: You may know her name -- Miss Minnie Caldecott . ''
Parsing [sent. 1513 len. 16]: Yes , Avice knew it quite well , and was duly impressed by the news .
Parsing [sent. 1514 len. 28]: She passed it on to her mother , who was sitting silently criticising the details of the room , while her husband talked to the older girls .
Parsing [sent. 1515 len. 19]: She also appeared impressed , and expressed a desire to hear Hope perform one of her own compositions .
Parsing [sent. 1516 len. 61]: Accordingly the piano was opened , and the girl sang , not one song , but two , so that her relations might appreciate the variety of her style : first the graceful and would-be classical setting to the words which Miss Minnie had despised , and then the more taking , if less high-class , `` domestic '' ditty .
Parsing [sent. 1517 len. 30]: Mrs Loftus had little of the maternal instinct in her composition , but even her hard face softened as Hope 's fresh voice sang the sweet , simple words .
Parsing [sent. 1518 len. 6]: Uncle Loftus cried `` Bravo !
Parsing [sent. 1519 len. 3]: bravo ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1520 len. 7]: and Avice opened wide surprised eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1521 len. 14]: Mrs Loftus put up her eyeglasses and examined the singer in critical fashion .
Parsing [sent. 1522 len. 10]: So young ; so pretty ; so exceptionally gifted !
Parsing [sent. 1523 len. 21]: Really , the girl would be a useful addition to an evening 's entertainment or a house-party in the country .
Parsing [sent. 1524 len. 45]: She made a mental note that Hope was the `` presentable '' member of the family , then rose to take her departure , murmuring society nothings as she shook hands with Philippa , and checking Avice 's farewell words with a warning frown .
Parsing [sent. 1525 len. 11]: `` Oh yes , we must arrange to meet again .
Parsing [sent. 1526 len. 7]: I will look over our list .
Parsing [sent. 1527 len. 17]: Do n't make any plans to-day , dear ; you are so overdone with engagements . ''
Parsing [sent. 1528 len. 44]: She rustled to the door , followed by her obedient spouse , who was allowed no time to speak , but instead delivered himself of a succession of mysterious nods and smiles , which left the girls in a state of amused mystification .
Parsing [sent. 1529 len. 56]: The explanation was , however , speedily forthcoming , for ten minutes had not elapsed after the departure of the three when a second bell sounded , and there stood Mr Loftus , erect and self-confident , a man on his own account , with no overwhelming feminine element to keep him in the background .
Parsing [sent. 1530 len. 9]: `` Back again like a bad penny ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1531 len. 4]: he cried jocosely .
Parsing [sent. 1532 len. 18]: `` Just a word to say to you , my dears -- a word in your ears .
Parsing [sent. 1533 len. 16]: Put the ladies into the carriage , and went on ` to my club . '
Parsing [sent. 1534 len. 4]: He , he !
Parsing [sent. 1535 len. 5]: Useful things , clubs !
Parsing [sent. 1536 len. 6]: About that boy , now .
Parsing [sent. 1537 len. 25]: Do n't approve of your spending capital -- never approved of that , you know -- but pleased to help you all the same .
Parsing [sent. 1538 len. 4]: Edgar 's children .
Parsing [sent. 1539 len. 2]: Yes !
Parsing [sent. 1540 len. 7]: Ought to give you a lift .
Parsing [sent. 1541 len. 4]: Fifteen -- eh ?
Parsing [sent. 1542 len. 14]: Young to leave school , but ca n't be helped , I suppose .
Parsing [sent. 1543 len. 20]: Was speaking to Spence the other day -- most influential man -- thinks he might take him in there .
Parsing [sent. 1544 len. 2]: Eh ?
Parsing [sent. 1545 len. 10]: Insurance office -- huge place -- hundreds of clerks .
Parsing [sent. 1546 len. 4]: Spence is manager .
Parsing [sent. 1547 len. 6]: Always taking in new fellows .
Parsing [sent. 1548 len. 10]: What do you think of that -- eh ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1549 len. 45]: `` Please sit down , uncle , '' said Philippa , greatly puzzled by the short , jerky sentences ; and , so far as she could judge of the proposal , thinking about as badly of it as it was possible to do .
Parsing [sent. 1550 len. 39]: `` It is very kind of you to remember Barney , and we are most anxious to find him an opening , but I do n't know that insurance -- and such a number of clerks , too !
Parsing [sent. 1551 len. 22]: Would not a boy be likely to be lost among them , and drudge on year after year without promotion ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1552 len. 14]: `` In an ordinary way , yes ; but this would be different .
Parsing [sent. 1553 len. 17]: I 'm on the Board , you see -- on the Board -- chairman last year .
Parsing [sent. 1554 len. 5]: Spence a personal friend .
Parsing [sent. 1555 len. 11]: Could help him on if he stuck to his work .
Parsing [sent. 1556 len. 29]: Do n't know the boy , but if Spence took a fancy to him , there is n't a man in town who has more in his power .
Parsing [sent. 1557 len. 5]: Peculiar man , Spence !
Parsing [sent. 1558 len. 20]: Difficult temper -- autocratic ; but if he takes a fancy , there 's nothing he wo n't do .
Parsing [sent. 1559 len. 13]: Barney , now -- what kind of a boy is Barney ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1560 len. 10]: `` All kinds , '' replied Philippa , smiling .
Parsing [sent. 1561 len. 36]: She felt perfectly satisfied that Mr Spence _ would _ take a fancy to Barney , but whether that young gentleman would `` stick '' to his work was another and a very different question .
Parsing [sent. 1562 len. 18]: `` He is a very handsome boy , Uncle Loftus , and full of fun and mischief .
Parsing [sent. 1563 len. 12]: He is clever , but I 'm afraid not too industrious .
Parsing [sent. 1564 len. 26]: We hope that he will settle down and realise that he has his way to make ; but he is young , as you say .
Parsing [sent. 1565 len. 10]: Mr Spence might not have patience with him . ''
Parsing [sent. 1566 len. 14]: `` Oh , Spence would have nothing to do with him at first .
Parsing [sent. 1567 len. 11]: He would have to obey the head of his department .
Parsing [sent. 1568 len. 9]: Send Stephen to me to talk it over .
Parsing [sent. 1569 len. 19]: Men understand business ; girls , you know -- pretty girls like you -- think only of bonnets .
Parsing [sent. 1570 len. 10]: That 's it , Hope , is n't it ?
Parsing [sent. 1571 len. 5]: Quite right , too .
Parsing [sent. 1572 len. 20]: Get a becoming one , my dear , and come and see me in it when it is bought .
Parsing [sent. 1573 len. 6]: Now I must be off .
Parsing [sent. 1574 len. 16]: Glad to have seen you all Pretty little nest at the top of the tree !
Parsing [sent. 1575 len. 6]: Hope it may be prophetic .
Parsing [sent. 1576 len. 7]: Hard on my legs , though .
Parsing [sent. 1577 len. 5]: Stiff in the knees .
Parsing [sent. 1578 len. 18]: Not so young as I was , my dears -- not so young as I was . ''
Parsing [sent. 1579 len. 37]: He went toddling out of the door , smiling and chuckling to himself , and as he descended the staircase the echo of disjointed phrases reached the girls ' ears : `` Top of the tree !
Parsing [sent. 1580 len. 4]: Ha , ha !
Parsing [sent. 1581 len. 7]: Not so young as I was .
Parsing [sent. 1582 len. 4]: Prophetic -- eh !
Parsing [sent. 1583 len. 6]: Hope it is prophetic . ''
Parsing [sent. 1584 len. 6]: `` Poor little mannikin ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1585 len. 4]: said Philippa pitifully .
Parsing [sent. 1586 len. 9]: `` I feel like a mother to him .
Parsing [sent. 1587 len. 18]: He dare n't even be kind in his wife 's presence , he is so kept down .
Parsing [sent. 1588 len. 13]: How I do detest to see women snub their husbands and fathers !
Parsing [sent. 1589 len. 21]: When I marry I intend to look up to my husband and think him the finest man in the world .
Parsing [sent. 1590 len. 21]: I 'd rather be ruled by some one stronger and wiser than myself than have it all my own way .
Parsing [sent. 1591 len. 23]: _ My _ husband is going to be master of his own house , or I 'll know the reason why . ''
Parsing [sent. 1592 len. 81]: She was leaning over the banisters as she spoke , listening to the departing footsteps of the `` mannikin '' as he trotted along the stone entrance-hall ; but as she finished speaking she drew back with a gasp of dismay , for a cadaverous countenance was raised to hers from the landing immediately beneath , and the tenant who had objected to Hope 's practising stood for a moment buttoning his coat , then slowly took his way downstairs .
Parsing [sent. 1593 len. 26]: With one bound , as it seemed , the girls were back in their own sitting-room , confronting each other with horrified , scarlet faces .
Parsing [sent. 1594 len. 5]: `` The Hermit ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1595 len. 14]: `` The author creature who writes all day and sits up all night .
Parsing [sent. 1596 len. 9]: Do you suppose he _ heard _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1597 len. 3]: `` Heard !
Parsing [sent. 1598 len. 13]: My dear , he has ears ; how could he help it ?
Parsing [sent. 1599 len. 25]: If you _ will _ air your ideas as to your future husband on the landing of public buildings , what can you expect ?
Parsing [sent. 1600 len. 3]: Never mind .
Parsing [sent. 1601 len. 17]: Perhaps it 's just as well that you should understand each other from the first . ''
Parsing [sent. 1602 len. 8]: `` Do n't be vulgar , Madge .
Parsing [sent. 1603 len. 13]: That kind of joke is in the worst possible taste . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 1604 len. 3]: ` Pologise !
Parsing [sent. 1605 len. 7]: My vulgar nature , I suppose .
Parsing [sent. 1606 len. 7]: _ Did n't _ he stare ?
Parsing [sent. 1607 len. 5]: He looks shockingly ill .
Parsing [sent. 1608 len. 18]: I should say his nerves were overstrained , and he would n't be too pleasant a companion .
Parsing [sent. 1609 len. 8]: I hope he wo n't call . ''
Parsing [sent. 1610 len. 21]: `` People never call in London , child , unless they have some sort of introduction or a mutual friend .
Parsing [sent. 1611 len. 14]: Besides , the porter told me that the Hermit is quite a celebrity .
Parsing [sent. 1612 len. 7]: Why should he call upon us ?
Parsing [sent. 1613 len. 18]: He writes articles for the reviews , and long , learned books which no one can understand .
Parsing [sent. 1614 len. 9]: I will never try to , for one .
Parsing [sent. 1615 len. 13]: I hope I may never , never see his face again ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1616 len. 40]: cried Philippa , in a sudden outburst of passion , for it was really most trying to discover a strange man playing the part of audience on the one occasion on which she had `` let herself go . ''
Parsing [sent. 1617 len. 28]: Stephen called upon Mr Loftus as suggested , was taken to interview the eccentric Mr Spence , and eventually decided to accept the offered opening for Barney .
Parsing [sent. 1618 len. 44]: It was not exactly the position which he would have chosen , but beggars can not be choosers , and his uncle 's influence , backed by a personal introduction to the manager , seemed to hold out a reasonable chance of promotion .
Parsing [sent. 1619 len. 37]: At the worst , the experience would give the boy some knowledge of office life , and prevent his running wild over London , getting into fresh mischief with every hour , as his custom was .
Parsing [sent. 1620 len. 11]: The half-term arrived , and with it Mr Barnard himself .
Parsing [sent. 1621 len. 23]: The lad drove up in a hansom , and smiled patronisingly upon the sisters assembled to welcome him in the bare entrance-hall .
Parsing [sent. 1622 len. 31]: He was nearly as tall as Philippa herself , and very like her in appearance , though his sparkling face lacked as yet her characteristic strength and earnestness of expression .
Parsing [sent. 1623 len. 23]: So far , indeed , life had appeared one huge joke to Barney , and his radiant spirits had suffered no eclipse .
Parsing [sent. 1624 len. 46]: He allowed himself to be kissed and hugged by one sister after another , and was then escorted up the stone staircase with all the honours of a returned hero , the while his bright eyes roved from side to side in search of adventure .
Parsing [sent. 1625 len. 27]: He tested the banister , calculated its length from top to bottom , and offered to race Madge down with a handicap of half a minute .
Parsing [sent. 1626 len. 38]: He pointed to the bottles of fire-extinguishers ranged on each landing , and cried genially , `` We 'll start an alarm of fire one night , and watch the Johnnies rush out and smash 'em ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1627 len. 48]: Then seeing the words , '' _ Do not knock unless absolutely necessary _ , '' printed on a card nailed to the `` Hermit 's '' door , he lingered behind to give such a resounding rat-tat-tat to the knocker as woke the echoes to life .
Parsing [sent. 1628 len. 18]: The girls scuttled upstairs like so many frightened mice ; but what was the good of that ?
Parsing [sent. 1629 len. 32]: They could not hide the noise of their footsteps , and once in the precincts of their own flat they one and all fell upon Barney , covering him with reproaches .
Parsing [sent. 1630 len. 4]: How could he ?
Parsing [sent. 1631 len. 4]: How dared he ?
Parsing [sent. 1632 len. 11]: It was rude , ungentlemanly , unfair to his sisters .
Parsing [sent. 1633 len. 14]: He must never -- no , never -- do such a thing again !
Parsing [sent. 1634 len. 7]: `` Well , scarcely ever ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1635 len. 5]: cried the beaming culprit .
Parsing [sent. 1636 len. 10]: `` So this is the rabbit-warren , is it !
Parsing [sent. 1637 len. 6]: What a rummy little show !
Parsing [sent. 1638 len. 7]: When will the feed be ready ?
Parsing [sent. 1639 len. 6]: I 'm dying of hunger .
Parsing [sent. 1640 len. 15]: Hope you 've slain a jolly big calf while you were about it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1641 len. 95]: When the `` calf '' appeared , and the reunited family seated themselves round the dining-room table , Barney wished to bet some one `` a tanner '' that without leaving his chair he could ring the bell , poke the fire , pull up the blind , and put a plate on the sideboard ; and proceeding to give practical illustration of his words , overbalanced himself , grazed his head against a corner of the bookcase , and made an ugly stain upon the wall-paper with the contents of his overturned plate .
Parsing [sent. 1642 len. 7]: `` Really , Barney -- really !
Parsing [sent. 1643 len. 7]: That 's not at all amusing .
Parsing [sent. 1644 len. 36]: I do n't feel in the _ least _ inclined to laugh , '' protested Philippa severely ; but she belied the truth of her words by smiling lovingly on the culprit throughout the meal .
Parsing [sent. 1645 len. 17]: It was easy to see who was going to be master of _ that _ flat !
Parsing [sent. 1646 len. 3]: CHAPTER NINE .
Parsing [sent. 1647 len. 4]: AN ANONYMOUS LETTER .
Parsing [sent. 1648 len. 47]: Barney 's infectious spirits were a godsend to his sisters , who , truth to tell , were beginning to experience a reaction from their first elation , and to realise how many weary rungs of the ladder had to be ascended before success was gained .
Parsing [sent. 1649 len. 50]: Theo felt that she was condescending sadly when she sent off her MS to the editor of a threepenny magazine ; but that gentleman evidently differed from her opinion , for he sent it back again with admirable promptitude , with only a printed rejection by way of criticism .
Parsing [sent. 1650 len. 36]: Hope received no answer from Miss Minnie Caldecott , and Madge found herself ranked with other new-comers in the antique room at the Slade School , and treated with patronising disdain by the older pupils .
Parsing [sent. 1651 len. 44]: These latter worked `` in the life , '' and had merry little lunches together in the corridors , while she ate sandwiches in the dreary cloak-room in the basement , and sadly reflected that she was not the genius she had imagined .
Parsing [sent. 1652 len. 32]: Her talent lay in caricature and bright original design , and pray how was she to have a chance of exhibiting these gifts in a copy of the Venus de Milo ?
Parsing [sent. 1653 len. 31]: The probabilities of earning money seemed to retreat into the dim distance , and poor Philippa realised as much , and sighed more and more heavily over the weekly bills .
Parsing [sent. 1654 len. 23]: It was a relief to all to listen to Barney 's merry voice , and to sun themselves in his radiant presence .
Parsing [sent. 1655 len. 44]: The account of his luncheon in town was a daily amusement ; for he had strongly objected to coming home in the middle of the day , and had finally been allowed the lordly sum of eight-pence by the head of the exchequer .
Parsing [sent. 1656 len. 28]: `` It is twice as much as your return fare in the Tube , so I calculate that would be about the cost of your lunch here .
Parsing [sent. 1657 len. 38]: If you go to the right places , Steve says , you can get quite a comfortable meal for eight-pence -- a plate of warm , nourishing soup , or a cup of chocolate and sandwiches . ''
Parsing [sent. 1658 len. 29]: So spoke Philippa in her wisdom , but Barney was too much of a schoolboy to condescend to warm and nourishing diet while sweetmeats were within his reach .
Parsing [sent. 1659 len. 65]: On a chill and rainy day he would make a selection of three custard-tarts and a bottle of lemonade , or a cold mince-pie , a slice of plum-cake , and a glass of milk ; after which exploit he would return home in the best of health and spirits , to eat at one meal as much as his four sisters put together .
Parsing [sent. 1660 len. 61]: As to his business experiences , Barney was curiously reticent , but he pronounced the office `` not bad sport , '' talked of the heads of departments by their Christian names , alluded to the manager as `` Old Waxworks , '' and was so uncomplaining about the long confinement that Philippa cherished the fondest hopes of his success .
Parsing [sent. 1661 len. 30]: The boy had settled down far better than she had expected , and if he were a trifle uproarious at home , it was not to be wondered at .
Parsing [sent. 1662 len. 30]: Before his arrival Hope had played favourite classics for the amusement of her sisters during the evening , but Master Barney had little patience with such a tame performance .
Parsing [sent. 1663 len. 39]: He preferred to hear popular street ditties , coached Hope in the airs in a loud , cracked treble , and insisted on a chorus , as often as not throwing in a step-dance by way of improvement .
Parsing [sent. 1664 len. 24]: From time to time one of his sisters would offer a mild protest : `` Do n't , Barney -- do n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1665 len. 7]: `` Barney , be quiet ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1666 len. 28]: Whereupon Barney would give a louder stamp than before , or , by way of reply , elegantly wave a foot over the head of the protester .
Parsing [sent. 1667 len. 42]: On one of these convivial occasions there sounded once again that eloquent echo from below ; but the performer was happily unconscious , and his sisters , rolling meaning eyes , exerted every device to divert his attention in another direction .
Parsing [sent. 1668 len. 38]: Well they knew that if Mr Barney once grasped the nature of the message his energy would increase tenfold , and he would dance until he dropped , if only to prove his free and independent spirit !
Parsing [sent. 1669 len. 11]: Then one evening came the formal opening of the war .
Parsing [sent. 1670 len. 20]: At an unorthodox hour of the night the letter-box clanked , and an undirected note fell into the box .
Parsing [sent. 1671 len. 25]: Philippa read it , and grew pale with anger ; Madge read it , and grew flaming red ; Hope cried , `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 1672 len. 3]: oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1673 len. 10]: and Theo tossed her head like a tragedy queen .
Parsing [sent. 1674 len. 51]: The note was short and to the point ; it bore neither address nor signature : `` If the occupants of flat Number 10 would have the consideration to remember the existence of their neighbours , it would add greatly to the comfort of the other dwellers in the mansions .
Parsing [sent. 1675 len. 16]: Such establishments could not continue to exist if rowdiness and horseplay were permitted without protest .
Parsing [sent. 1676 len. 22]: It is sincerely to be hoped that the matter may be remedied before appeal be necessary to those in authority . ''
Parsing [sent. 1677 len. 5]: `` Anonymous , too !
Parsing [sent. 1678 len. 13]: As if we did not know perfectly well who wrote it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1679 len. 7]: Philippa cried , with curling lip .
Parsing [sent. 1680 len. 6]: `` Cranky , sallow-faced wretch !
Parsing [sent. 1681 len. 15]: He ought to live in a den , and not among ordinary flesh-and-blood mortals .
Parsing [sent. 1682 len. 8]: _ I 'll _ write an answer !
Parsing [sent. 1683 len. 8]: _ I 'll _ settle him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1684 len. 22]: `` He banged on the ceiling one day when I was practising , '' chimed in Hope , with smouldering resentment .
Parsing [sent. 1685 len. 16]: `` It is n't as if I were a schoolgirl and could n't play . ''
Parsing [sent. 1686 len. 12]: `` Thinks we make too much noise , does he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1687 len. 4]: murmured Barney thoughtfully .
Parsing [sent. 1688 len. 4]: `` Sweet innocent !
Parsing [sent. 1689 len. 8]: He does n't know he is born .
Parsing [sent. 1690 len. 15]: Wait a bit until I have really given my mind to the subject . ''
Parsing [sent. 1691 len. 12]: `` No , no ; none of that now , Barney !
Parsing [sent. 1692 len. 19]: If we live in a flat we are bound to keep within bounds , '' interrupted Stephen anxiously .
Parsing [sent. 1693 len. 24]: He reviewed the past fortnight , and was bound to acknowledge that the writer of the note had some just ground for complaint .
Parsing [sent. 1694 len. 13]: `` I am afraid we have been rather noisy since you arrived .
Parsing [sent. 1695 len. 30]: -- But perhaps you can explain in your reply , Phil , that there have been -- er -- special circumstances -- er -- not likely to occur again .
Parsing [sent. 1696 len. 4]: Smooth him down .
Parsing [sent. 1697 len. 10]: Great mistake to quarrel with one 's neighbours . ''
Parsing [sent. 1698 len. 23]: Philippa looked her brother over , her head erect , her shoulders squared in the defiant manner he had learned to know .
Parsing [sent. 1699 len. 19]: She made no reply in words , but he understood full well what was meant by that look .
Parsing [sent. 1700 len. 55]: If he were prepared to give in meekly , she was not ; if he would not fight for the rights of the family , she would do it for him ; and it would not be to-day nor to-morrow either that she would write an apology in response to so audacious a complaint .
Parsing [sent. 1701 len. 89]: All that evening Philippa sat with pursed-up lips , composing and revising an answer which should be at once haughty , sarcastic , and to the point ; and no sooner was Stephen safely out of the way next morning than it was written , submitted to Theo for professional revision , and safely deposited in the `` Hermit 's '' letter-box : `` Miss Charrington is in receipt of an anonymous letter , the source of which , however , she is at no lose to decide .
Parsing [sent. 1702 len. 37]: She agrees with the writer that forbearance and consideration are necessary where several tenants live beneath the same roof , but she would impress upon his notice that such consideration should be mutual and not one-sided .
Parsing [sent. 1703 len. 18]: It is unreasonable to expect a large and still young family '' -- -LSB- `` Still young !
Parsing [sent. 1704 len. 17]: he wo n't like that -- it implies that he is so old himself ! '' -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 1705 len. 51]: -- `` to live in a condition of absolute inaction ; and repeated and varied complaints '' -- -LSB- `` That means the rapping on the ceiling '' -RSB- -- `` are at least as disagreeable to its members as their musical efforts appear to be to their neighbour . ''
Parsing [sent. 1706 len. 61]: `` That ought to settle him for some time to come , '' cried the girls complacently ; and when by chance they met the `` Hermit '' on the stairs they stared at him beneath haughtily contracted brows , and held their skirts well to the side , lest by chance they should brush against him as they passed .
Parsing [sent. 1707 len. 19]: November was half-way through when a second letter arrived to introduce a little excitement into the daily routine .
Parsing [sent. 1708 len. 21]: It bore the postmark of a small Norfolk township , on the borders of which Mr Loftus had his shooting-box .
Parsing [sent. 1709 len. 21]: It was addressed to Hope , and was of an import which brought a flush of excitement to her cheeks .
Parsing [sent. 1710 len. 5]: Her `` Ohs ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1711 len. 5]: and `` Ahs ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1712 len. 72]: of surprise were aggravatingly uninstructive , and in the end Madge took forcible possession of the sheet , and glancing over it rapidly , read out the sentences in slow , sententious accents : `` My dear Hope , -- As the address will show , we are staying in Norfolk , and I write to ask if you would pay us a visit from Monday next to Tuesday the 30th .
Parsing [sent. 1713 len. 52]: We expect to have several big shoots during the week , and as you are distinctly the most presentable of the family , and your musical abilities can be usefully employed in providing free amusement for my guests , I think you will be quite a valuable addition to our house-party .
Parsing [sent. 1714 len. 32]: You will find the 11:15 a convenient train , and we will send to the station to meet you , if we have no better use for the carriages . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 1715 len. 5]: _ Madge _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1716 len. 5]: cried Hope , aghast .
Parsing [sent. 1717 len. 7]: `` What an extraordinary letter ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1718 len. 11]: gasped Philippa , too much stunned by surprise to protest .
Parsing [sent. 1719 len. 6]: `` Give it to me .
Parsing [sent. 1720 len. 5]: Let me see . ''
Parsing [sent. 1721 len. 18]: Madge handed it over , with a shrug of the shoulders and a slow , whimsical smile .
Parsing [sent. 1722 len. 17]: `` Oh , well , '' she admitted , `` that 's not a literal rendering .
Parsing [sent. 1723 len. 11]: I read between the lines and found the true meaning .
Parsing [sent. 1724 len. 9]: Aunt Loftus is all politeness , of course .
Parsing [sent. 1725 len. 14]: ` You do n't look strong -- would be better for a change .
Parsing [sent. 1726 len. 9]: Can leave London more easily than your sisters .
Parsing [sent. 1727 len. 9]: Be sure to bring plenty of music . '
Parsing [sent. 1728 len. 12]: But my reading is the right one , all the same .
Parsing [sent. 1729 len. 2]: Bah !
Parsing [sent. 1730 len. 2]: Sickening !
Parsing [sent. 1731 len. 26]: If you want to be mean , _ be _ mean , and do n't try to wrap it up in the form of philanthropy .
Parsing [sent. 1732 len. 20]: _ I _ might be as ill as _ I _ liked , but I should never be asked .
Parsing [sent. 1733 len. 8]: Your face is your fortune , Hope .
Parsing [sent. 1734 len. 13]: Make the most of it before you grow old and ugly . ''
Parsing [sent. 1735 len. 6]: `` I wo n't go .
Parsing [sent. 1736 len. 31]: I shall write and refuse , '' said Hope quickly ; for she had noticed a shadow fall across Theo 's face , and divined the reason of its presence .
Parsing [sent. 1737 len. 30]: Theo would not grudge her a pleasure , but from a professional point of view , could not help wishing that the invitation had fallen to her own share .
Parsing [sent. 1738 len. 32]: Life at a shooting-box would be a new experience , a useful background for future stories ; and the guests would supply the young author with the opportunity of valuable character-study .
Parsing [sent. 1739 len. 37]: Unfortunately Theo 's talent was not of value to a hostess , and she was conscious that her chance of an invitation to her uncle 's shooting-box was not much greater than that of Madge herself .
Parsing [sent. 1740 len. 32]: For a moment she was silent , battling against a host of conflicting emotions ; then she said bravely : `` You must go , Hope ; it is your duty .
Parsing [sent. 1741 len. 28]: You may meet people who will take an interest in you and be able to help you on , and we ca n't afford to lose opportunities .
Parsing [sent. 1742 len. 28]: You can take your own compositions , and sing them whenever you have a chance ; it will be quite an advertisement in a small way . ''
Parsing [sent. 1743 len. 26]: `` It seems mean to pay a visit with an idea of making something out of it , '' said Hope , with a sigh .
Parsing [sent. 1744 len. 9]: `` That is the worst of being poor .
Parsing [sent. 1745 len. 15]: The money question seems eternally hovering in the background , whatever one may do .
Parsing [sent. 1746 len. 30]: I shall enjoy seeing Avice , of course ; and if I can really help Aunt Loftus , it will be comforting to feel that the advantage is mutual .
Parsing [sent. 1747 len. 8]: I wonder -- What about clothes ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1748 len. 10]: `` That is just what I have been thinking .
Parsing [sent. 1749 len. 21]: We ca n't afford anything new just now , for the bills are to heavy , '' replied Philippa sadly .
Parsing [sent. 1750 len. 21]: `` We can only bestow our united treasures upon you , dear , and make you as smart as possible .
Parsing [sent. 1751 len. 29]: You shall have mother 's old lace for your evening-frock ; but be careful of it , for if you damage it you need never face me again !
Parsing [sent. 1752 len. 13]: It is going to trim my wedding-dress one of these days . ''
Parsing [sent. 1753 len. 16]: `` When the lordly male arrives before whom she is to grovel in the dust !
Parsing [sent. 1754 len. 9]: You shall have my feather boa , too .
Parsing [sent. 1755 len. 34]: It will hide the shabby front of your jacket ; '' and Theo sighed , for the feather boa was the pride of her wardrobe , and represented months of saving and self-denial .
Parsing [sent. 1756 len. 29]: It was none of your thin , lanky wisps , but a really handsome boa , with a bloom on the feathers like that on a hot-house grape .
Parsing [sent. 1757 len. 18]: Theo was fastidious , and would rather do without a thing altogether than accept a poor imitation .
Parsing [sent. 1758 len. 16]: She thought of her reduced appearance without the beloved fluffiness , and heaved another sigh .
Parsing [sent. 1759 len. 9]: `` Nothing to offer you , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 1760 len. 34]: My wardrobe is of so limited a character that if I gave anything away I should have to stay in bed until it was returned , '' cried Madge cheerfully in her turn .
Parsing [sent. 1761 len. 37]: `` Accept my blessing , and my earnest hope that the head of a great musical publishing house may be among the guests , and will recognise in you the coming genius of the day . ''
Parsing [sent. 1762 len. 8]: `` So likely , is n't it ?
Parsing [sent. 1763 len. 9]: That sort of thing happens only in novels .
Parsing [sent. 1764 len. 35]: The house will probably be full of sporting men , who do n't know one composer from another , but who find it enlivening to listen to a ` tune ' in the evening .
Parsing [sent. 1765 len. 9]: Oh , if Minnie Caldecott would only write !
Parsing [sent. 1766 len. 14]: I look out for that letter every morning , but it never comes .
Parsing [sent. 1767 len. 15]: Do you think I might send a little note to jog her memory ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1768 len. 5]: `` Certainly I do .
Parsing [sent. 1769 len. 17]: I should think she was the sort of woman who needed a good deal of jogging .
Parsing [sent. 1770 len. 26]: Say that you are anxious to know whether she wishes to secure the song , as , if not , you will offer it elsewhere .
Parsing [sent. 1771 len. 9]: There is nothing like appearing confident and unperturbed .
Parsing [sent. 1772 len. 37]: I am sorry you are going away , Hope , for I wanted you to sit for me as fair Rosamond in the picture I have to show to get permission to draw in the life-room .
Parsing [sent. 1773 len. 13]: I 'll have to send in an old one , I suppose .
Parsing [sent. 1774 len. 15]: Look over these for me , and tell me which you like best . ''
Parsing [sent. 1775 len. 22]: Hope turned over the sketches in the portfolio , smiling with sisterly pleasure as she recognised one old favourite after another .
Parsing [sent. 1776 len. 37]: It seemed incredible to her partiality that Madge should not have immediately ranked as a genius among the students of the school , for surely there was something peculiarly original in the treatment of these figures !
Parsing [sent. 1777 len. 16]: She held out a sheet towards her sisters , and cried eagerly , `` There !
Parsing [sent. 1778 len. 5]: That is my choice .
Parsing [sent. 1779 len. 8]: What do you think of that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1780 len. 10]: `` Good -- suggestive -- full of atmosphere ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1781 len. 30]: pronounced Theo in her most professional manner ; while Philippa put her head on one side , and in all innocence of heart launched a bombshell into their midst .
Parsing [sent. 1782 len. 9]: `` Would n't it make a good poster ?
Parsing [sent. 1783 len. 17]: Does n't it look exactly like some of the posters you see upon the hoardings ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1784 len. 35]: It was seldom indeed that a speech of Philippa 's could wound her faithful friend and admirer , but this time the arrow went home , and Madge 's thin cheek flushed with displeasure .
Parsing [sent. 1785 len. 26]: She gathered together the scattered sketches in silence , keeping her head rigorously turned aside , while Hope made strenuous efforts to redeem the situation .
Parsing [sent. 1786 len. 9]: `` Well , really , so it does !
Parsing [sent. 1787 len. 9]: They say poster-painting is quite an art nowadays .
Parsing [sent. 1788 len. 28]: I hear it pays so well that many artists would be thankful to take it up , if it were not that it requires a special talent .
Parsing [sent. 1789 len. 8]: Personally I hope it will be cultivated .
Parsing [sent. 1790 len. 17]: It would be so delightful to see the old eyesores replaced by really artistic pictures . ''
Parsing [sent. 1791 len. 3]: In vain !
Parsing [sent. 1792 len. 9]: Madge remained silent , red , and angry .
Parsing [sent. 1793 len. 30]: Poster-painting may be admirable in its way , but when a student dreams of becoming a female Leighton or Alma Tadema , the alternative is not welcomed with enthusiasm .
Parsing [sent. 1794 len. 48]: Philippa reflected sadly that another unfortunate remark was scored against her ; but Madge was of too happy a disposition to harbour a grudge , and in half-an-hour 's time the grievance was dismissed from her mind , and she was once more her own sunny self .
Parsing [sent. 1795 len. 34]: When Barney returned home that evening he joined in the general chorus of lament at Hope 's departure , though his sorrow flowed from a somewhat different source from that of his sisters .
Parsing [sent. 1796 len. 6]: `` What a fag ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1797 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 1798 len. 16]: `` Now that old Hermit Johnny will think that we are quiet because he complained .
Parsing [sent. 1799 len. 22]: I wish to goodness I had taken up the flute ; I would tootle all the evening for his amusement . ''
Parsing [sent. 1800 len. 19]: He sat for a while gazing at the ceiling in deep reflection , then slapped his knee ecstatically .
Parsing [sent. 1801 len. 19]: `` There 's a fellow in the office who belongs to the London Scottish and has a bigpipe .
Parsing [sent. 1802 len. 19]: I say , would n't it make the Hermit sit up if I borrowed it and practised reels !
Parsing [sent. 1803 len. 8]: McGregor would n't lend it , though .
Parsing [sent. 1804 len. 15]: He is a stingy beast who will never do a fellow a good turn .
Parsing [sent. 1805 len. 7]: I have a score against him !
Parsing [sent. 1806 len. 21]: Well , cheer up , Hope ; I 'll do my best to fill your place while you 're away .
Parsing [sent. 1807 len. 17]: I 'll find some way of keeping our friend alive , or I 'm mistaken . ''
Parsing [sent. 1808 len. 7]: `` Barney dear -- Barney ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1809 len. 4]: murmured Philippa softly .
Parsing [sent. 1810 len. 8]: Barney smiled at her with indulgent tenderness .
Parsing [sent. 1811 len. 10]: `` Keep your hair on , old lady ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1812 len. 37]: he said encouragingly ; and Philippa could only gasp and pant beneath his bear-like hug , and declare that never -- no , never -- had she met such an unmanageable , disrespectful , vulgar boy !
Parsing [sent. 1813 len. 3]: CHAPTER TEN .
Parsing [sent. 1814 len. 3]: THE SHANTY .
Parsing [sent. 1815 len. 45]: A week later Hope travelled down to Norfolk with the united fineries of the family in her box , a mind stored with good advice from the stock of worldly wisdom of her sisters , and a heart filled with mingled expectation and foreboding .
Parsing [sent. 1816 len. 48]: It was the first time in her life that she had paid a visit on her own account , and she realised , with a shock of surprise , what a child she remained in spite of her three-and-twenty years , and how unlimited was her inexperience !
Parsing [sent. 1817 len. 42]: Now that she was really on her way and it was too late to turn back , she sat aghast at her temerity in daring to face a houseful of strangers , and trembled at the ordeal of appearing before them .
Parsing [sent. 1818 len. 22]: She would arrive at the station at half-past four ; after that would follow a drive of , say , half-an-hour .
Parsing [sent. 1819 len. 20]: If she arrived at the house at five o'clock , would tea be over , or only in progress ?
Parsing [sent. 1820 len. 11]: Would the men have returned from their day 's sport ?
Parsing [sent. 1821 len. 39]: Would many guests be present to whom she must be introduced , and who would all want to know if she were tired , if the train had been punctual , if she had had a comfortable journey ?
Parsing [sent. 1822 len. 11]: Would there be any girls in the party besides herself ?
Parsing [sent. 1823 len. 12]: And if so , would they be very superior and fashionable !
Parsing [sent. 1824 len. 23]: Would Avice be friendly and affectionate , or too much taken up with her duties to waste time on insignificant Hope Charrington !
Parsing [sent. 1825 len. 21]: All these and a thousand other questions occupied Hope 's busy brain till she reached the end of her journey .
Parsing [sent. 1826 len. 30]: Insignificant Hope Charrington looked , if the truth were told , anything but insignificant as she took her place in the high dogcart that was waiting at the station .
Parsing [sent. 1827 len. 39]: As she drove through the little country town , more than one admiring glance was cast upon the pretty young lady whose golden hair and pink-and-white complexion showed to such advantage against the severe black of her attire .
Parsing [sent. 1828 len. 19]: Tired shop assistants gazed at her through the shop windows , and sighed with envy as they looked .
Parsing [sent. 1829 len. 35]: It must be so nice to be a lady and have nothing to do but enjoy one 's self , and look pretty , and never know an anxious thought all one 's days ?
Parsing [sent. 1830 len. 48]: That lovely young lady , for instance , was going to stay at The Shanty , where there was already a houseful of guests : handsome men ready to fall in love at a moment 's notice ; girls over whom the new-comer would reign as queen !
Parsing [sent. 1831 len. 31]: Her luggage was no doubt following in the cart : box upon box of fineries ; different dresses for every day in the week ; jewel-cases full of glittering gems !
Parsing [sent. 1832 len. 78]: So much for imagination , while in reality poor Hope was clenching her hands to keep from trembling , hoping with all her might that the one black silk evening-dress would not be a mass of creases when unpacked ; wondering if it were possible that where she was going she would meet a friend who might be able to help her to earn some money -- a little money to put towards those terrible household expenses .
Parsing [sent. 1833 len. 52]: Ten minutes ' drive and they had loft the town behind them ; another ten minutes and the lodge gates of The Shanty came in sight ; three minutes more and Hope was stepping inside an entrance-hall lined with fine old tapestries , and stretching the whole length of the house .
Parsing [sent. 1834 len. 24]: The sound of voices came to her ear , but she could not locate them until she had walked half-way down the hall .
Parsing [sent. 1835 len. 37]: Then a deep recess came in view on the right-hand side -- a recess as big as an ordinary room -- wherein a dozen people sat round a blazing fire , drinking tea with leisurely enjoyment .
Parsing [sent. 1836 len. 14]: At sight of the new-comer there was a general pause in the conversation .
Parsing [sent. 1837 len. 29]: Mrs Loftus rustled forward to greet her ; Avice smiled and extended a languid hand ; and Uncle Loftus murmured jocosely , `` Hope on , Hope ever !
Parsing [sent. 1838 len. 10]: So here you are , my dear -- eh !
Parsing [sent. 1839 len. 5]: Glad to see you .
Parsing [sent. 1840 len. 7]: Have a cup of tea ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1841 len. 6]: `` Sit here , Hope .
Parsing [sent. 1842 len. 38]: Let me introduce you , '' said her aunt ; and Hope listened confusedly to a long list of names , bowed automatically from time to time , then thankfully subsided into a seat in a corner .
Parsing [sent. 1843 len. 47]: There were two ladies present besides her aunt and cousin -- one elderly and prosaic matron , and one young and sparkling brunette , who was busily occupied flirting with three men at the same time , and seemed capable of adding indefinitely to their number .
Parsing [sent. 1844 len. 39]: For the rest , there were men in shooting-coats and leather gaiters -- old men , middle-aged men , young men , all bronzed and healthy , and remarkably well satisfied with themselves and their day 's sport .
Parsing [sent. 1845 len. 11]: Hope studied them shyly as she nibbled at her scone .
Parsing [sent. 1846 len. 28]: The buzz of conversation had begun again by this time , and as her presence was apparently forgotten , she was at leisure to pursue her investigations .
Parsing [sent. 1847 len. 13]: The stout , grey man was the husband of the prosaic lady .
Parsing [sent. 1848 len. 39]: The merry little man with the round bald head and the short legs was evidently an intimate of the family , for he threw fresh logs on the fire , and even dared to chaff Mrs Loftus herself .
Parsing [sent. 1849 len. 51]: The fair youth with the eyeglass was only pretending to be captivated by Miss Brunette ; the older man with the fair hair was seriously smitten ; the tall , distinguished-looking personage with the haughty eyelids and drooping moustache had the air of being bored by everything and every one .
Parsing [sent. 1850 len. 15]: Hope looked at him critically , with a view to describing him to Theo .
Parsing [sent. 1851 len. 8]: `` He would make a splendid hero .
Parsing [sent. 1852 len. 46]: Dark features , sharply cut ; two horizontal lines in his forehead ; lazy eyes that give a flash now and then , and show that he could be active enough if he chose ; a square chin ; and such great , wide shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 1853 len. 20]: He looks quite different from the other men ; and yet I do n't know why he should . ''
Parsing [sent. 1854 len. 23]: She looked him critically up and down , and her eyes , travelling upwards again , found his studying her in return .
Parsing [sent. 1855 len. 69]: It might have been an embarrassing discovery , but before it had time to become so the man who was different from other men had strolled across the hall , taken possession of the seat by her side , and was inquiring if she felt tired after her journey , in a tone which seemed to imply that he took not the faintest possible interest in her reply .
Parsing [sent. 1856 len. 37]: `` A little tired , '' said Hope prosaically , conscious that if Madge had been in her place she would have been ready with a vivacious retort which would have broken the ice of formality .
Parsing [sent. 1857 len. 10]: She felt quite unable to frame such a retort .
Parsing [sent. 1858 len. 20]: Instead she said simply , `` I am not particularly fond of railway travelling , and I dislike changes .
Parsing [sent. 1859 len. 17]: I never feel that I can settle down comfortably when there is a change before me .
Parsing [sent. 1860 len. 22]: Even if it is two hours ahead , I can not determine to undo a rug and make myself comfortable . ''
Parsing [sent. 1861 len. 4]: `` No ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1862 len. 29]: said Mr Merrilies ; and once again his voice sounded so flat and uninterested that she wished she had not been so explicit in setting forth her feelings .
Parsing [sent. 1863 len. 25]: She allowed herself to be helped to a second cup of tea , then relapsed into silence , waiting patiently for a fresh lead .
Parsing [sent. 1864 len. 26]: The other men were discussing the day 's sport , and presently her companion must needs report on `` the bag '' in his turn .
Parsing [sent. 1865 len. 36]: `` We have been over the Tansy Woods to-day , seven of us , and the bag was two hundred and fifteen pheasants , a brace of partridges , thirty hares , and ninety-five rabbits .
Parsing [sent. 1866 len. 8]: Pretty fair , is n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1867 len. 11]: `` I do n't know , '' said Hope simply .
Parsing [sent. 1868 len. 7]: `` I know nothing about shooting .
Parsing [sent. 1869 len. 20]: Neither my father nor brother was a sportsman , so I can not judge what is bad or good .
Parsing [sent. 1870 len. 7]: It seems a tremendous number . ''
Parsing [sent. 1871 len. 32]: She looked so pretty and so winsome as she glanced at him with her childlike eyes that his face relaxed from its set lines , and he smiled in involuntary friendliness .
Parsing [sent. 1872 len. 30]: `` A few years ago it would have been a record day , a day to put in the papers , but now it is nothing at all extraordinary .
Parsing [sent. 1873 len. 20]: In shooting , as in everything else , the standard has risen , and we are less easily satisfied .
Parsing [sent. 1874 len. 15]: It is an age of great expectations ; do n't you think so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1875 len. 38]: `` I do n't know , '' said Hope again ; but her brow clouded , and presently she asked in an anxious little voice , `` Do you really think the standard has risen in everything !
Parsing [sent. 1876 len. 27]: Would it be more difficult to do well in -- er -- in any profession , for instance , than it was a dozen years ago !
Parsing [sent. 1877 len. 9]: Would you have to be much cleverer ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1878 len. 6]: `` Oh dear , yes !
Parsing [sent. 1879 len. 4]: certainly you would .
Parsing [sent. 1880 len. 7]: It is a different thing altogether .
Parsing [sent. 1881 len. 24]: A dozen years ago people were easily pleased , and ready to make allowances , but nothing short of perfection satisfies us nowadays .
Parsing [sent. 1882 len. 20]: The days of the amateur are past ; even professionals need constant study to maintain their high standard . ''
Parsing [sent. 1883 len. 8]: `` Y-es , '' assented Hope faintly .
Parsing [sent. 1884 len. 38]: She thought of her poor little songs , of Theo 's `` worrying '' story , and Madge 's poster-like pictures , and felt a sinking of heart that took away her appetite for scones and plum-cake .
Parsing [sent. 1885 len. 26]: She and her sisters had thought themselves geniuses at dear little Leabourne , but three months ' experience of London had brought a bitter disillusionment .
Parsing [sent. 1886 len. 32]: She stared at the ground , and Mr Merrilies in his turn stared at her charming profile , and sighed to think that the prettiest girls were generally the most stupid .
Parsing [sent. 1887 len. 18]: He was unfeignedly relieved when Avice came forward to take her cousin upstairs to dress for dinner .
Parsing [sent. 1888 len. 59]: The room which had been set apart for Hope was one of the smallest and least handsomely furnished in the house , as became the abode of a poor relation ; but it looked attractive enough , all the same , with a bright little fire burning in the grate and the curtains drawn cosily over the windows .
Parsing [sent. 1889 len. 25]: Hope 's box had already been unpacked , and as there could be no question of `` What will you wear for dinner ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1890 len. 13]: there lay the black silk on the bed , solid and sober .
Parsing [sent. 1891 len. 6]: Avice glanced at it carelessly .
Parsing [sent. 1892 len. 10]: `` Oh yes , that will do very well .
Parsing [sent. 1893 len. 28]: We shall be quite alone , '' she said , with a nod ; then leant against the mantelpiece and smiled at her cousin with languid friendliness .
Parsing [sent. 1894 len. 43]: She gave the impression of wishing to be really kind , but of lacking the energy to put her intention into effect ; as a matter of fact , the girl was too anaemic to feel keen interest in anything or anybody .
Parsing [sent. 1895 len. 8]: `` Sure you have all you want ?
Parsing [sent. 1896 len. 17]: If you require anything just ring , and it will be brought to you at once .
Parsing [sent. 1897 len. 12]: You need n't be downstairs for an hour and a half .
Parsing [sent. 1898 len. 14]: There are some books over there if you would like to read . ''
Parsing [sent. 1899 len. 11]: `` Could n't you stay and talk to me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1900 len. 40]: asked Hope shyly ; but Avice thought not -- thought she had better lie down -- thought there would be plenty of time to talk another day , and glided listlessly away , leaving the new-comer chilled and disappointed .
Parsing [sent. 1901 len. 57]: A little reading ; a home letter written with a `` detaily '' description of journey , arrival , and first impressions ; a careful if simple toilet , made short work of the hour and a half 's waiting , and Hope stopped shyly out of her room to find her way along the corridor .
Parsing [sent. 1902 len. 42]: Half-way down a door creaked , a pair of dark eyes peered cautiously forth , followed by the whole of a curly dark head , and Miss Brunette 's voice accosted her with the ease and geniality of an old acquaintance .
Parsing [sent. 1903 len. 5]: `` There you are !
Parsing [sent. 1904 len. 11]: I have been looking out for you for an age !
Parsing [sent. 1905 len. 14]: Do come and lace up my dress , there 's a kind creature !
Parsing [sent. 1906 len. 21]: I have rung the bell three times over , but I suppose it is broken , as nobody has appeared .
Parsing [sent. 1907 len. 15]: I did n't bring a maid with me this time ; did you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1908 len. 3]: `` I ?
Parsing [sent. 1909 len. 3]: A maid !
Parsing [sent. 1910 len. 34]: I never possessed such a thing in my life , '' cried Hope , laughing ; at which Miss Brunette stared , looked her critically up and down , and affected to frown .
Parsing [sent. 1911 len. 3]: `` Really ?
Parsing [sent. 1912 len. 9]: But then it does n't matter to you .
Parsing [sent. 1913 len. 18]: You are one of those exasperating people who ca n't help looking nice , whatever they do .
Parsing [sent. 1914 len. 13]: I _ did _ bless you when you walked in this afternoon !
Parsing [sent. 1915 len. 24]: If there is one thing that makes me wild , it is to have a better-looking girl than myself staying in a house .
Parsing [sent. 1916 len. 30]: I have had it all my own way here so far , for Avice is too lazy to count , but now I shall have to play second fiddle .
Parsing [sent. 1917 len. 8]: Men are so silly about pretty faces .
Parsing [sent. 1918 len. 7]: Do you think I am pretty ?
Parsing [sent. 1919 len. 2]: Honestly ?
Parsing [sent. 1920 len. 21]: Yes , most people do ; but , to tell you a dead secret , it is all a mistake .
Parsing [sent. 1921 len. 23]: I am really barely good-looking , but I give an impression of prettiness by my vivacity and strict attention to business . ''
Parsing [sent. 1922 len. 15]: Hope laughed , and the two girls chattered gaily together over the belated toilet .
Parsing [sent. 1923 len. 17]: When it was finished Truda Bennett slid her hand through Hope 's arm in friendly confidence .
Parsing [sent. 1924 len. 10]: `` You are a dear , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 1925 len. 5]: `` I like you .
Parsing [sent. 1926 len. 15]: When you came in I thought you were bound to be slow and proper .
Parsing [sent. 1927 len. 9]: I always mistrust fair girls with blue eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1928 len. 19]: Nine times out of ten they are deadly uninteresting ; but I can see you are an exception .
Parsing [sent. 1929 len. 21]: I will try not to be jealous of you , if you will promise not to flirt with Ralph Merrilies .
Parsing [sent. 1930 len. 15]: I 'm especially interested in him ; so play fair , wo n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 1931 len. 8]: You may have all the others . ''
Parsing [sent. 1932 len. 6]: `` How wholesale of you !
Parsing [sent. 1933 len. 7]: Are you sure you mean it ?
Parsing [sent. 1934 len. 18]: From what I have seen , I should imagine you would hardly be satisfied with one . ''
Parsing [sent. 1935 len. 31]: In dealing with such a very outspoken young lady , it seemed best to reply in the same strain , but Hope marvelled inwardly at the eccentricities of human nature .
Parsing [sent. 1936 len. 28]: Imagine -- just imagine -- being `` interested '' in somebody , and confiding the fact to a stranger the very first time one spoke to her !
Parsing [sent. 1937 len. 28]: It would be difficult enough to speak of it even to Theo , her lifelong friend and companion ; but to a stranger -- it was incredible !
Parsing [sent. 1938 len. 36]: She studied the girl 's dark face with curious eyes as they walked downstairs , while the men gathered round the fireplace below , watched them as they approached , and admired the pretty picture .
Parsing [sent. 1939 len. 29]: They made a charming contrast -- the sparkling brunette in her amber draperies , and the tall figure in the black dress , with the sweet pink-and-white face .
Parsing [sent. 1940 len. 48]: Directly after dinner Mrs Loftus sent Hope to the piano , and the girl sat down unaffectedly , and played several pieces in succession , to the complete satisfaction of the company , who apparently found it much more agreeable to discourse to music than without it .
Parsing [sent. 1941 len. 53]: Mr Merrilies , indeed , did stroll across the room , to stand by her side and say `` Thank you '' at the conclusion , as if he meant what he said ; but from a general point of view the performance was a failure , and Mrs Loftus felt disappointed .
Parsing [sent. 1942 len. 31]: Hope had been invited with the especial intent of providing amusement for her guests , and if she failed to do so there was really no reason for her presence .
Parsing [sent. 1943 len. 14]: `` Sing something to us , Hope , '' said Mrs Loftus imperiously .
Parsing [sent. 1944 len. 8]: `` Sing some of your own songs .
Parsing [sent. 1945 len. 25]: -- Miss Charrington has composed some charming little things , '' she explained to the company at large , who murmured politely in response .
Parsing [sent. 1946 len. 3]: `` Compose ?
Parsing [sent. 1947 len. 5]: How wonderful of you !
Parsing [sent. 1948 len. 9]: How do you manage to do it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1949 len. 54]: queried Truda eagerly , while the fair youth pulled his moustache and looked at Hope as if she were a wild animal escaped from the Zoo , and Uncle Loftus began humming what he fondly supposed to be the air of `` The Song of Sleep '' to his companion on the sofa .
Parsing [sent. 1950 len. 44]: Plainly , the best thing to do was to begin at once before the situation grew more embarrassing , so Hope broke into the accompaniment of song number one , a simple but taking little production which had been published two years before .
Parsing [sent. 1951 len. 19]: It was greeted with applause , so spontaneous and genuine that it could not fail to be inspiriting .
Parsing [sent. 1952 len. 35]: Hope forgot to be nervous , and sang `` Pack Clouds Away '' in her best style , sweetly , smoothly , and with that distinctness of enunciation which is so rare a charm .
Parsing [sent. 1953 len. 49]: More applause followed , more exclamations of appreciation , more queries as to how she did it , and then Uncle Loftus must needs begin humming again , and put in a request for `` The sleepy one , you know -- the one you wrote to order .
Parsing [sent. 1954 len. 12]: That is the gem of the collection , in my opinion .
Parsing [sent. 1955 len. 13]: We should like to hear the sleepy one , my dear . ''
Parsing [sent. 1956 len. 76]: Now , as it happened , Hope was by no means anxious to grant this request , for the idea which Miss Caldecott had so slightly suggested had appealed very strongly to her sensitive nature , and she had put into it her best work , with the hope that when listening to it its hearers might feel something of the same thrill , the same earnestness , which she had experienced in its composition .
Parsing [sent. 1957 len. 43]: She had never been able to go through it unmoved , and it seemed almost sacrilege to sing it in this room full of noisy strangers , who would miss its point , and at best pronounce it `` sweetly pretty . ''
Parsing [sent. 1958 len. 24]: She tried to protest , to declare that she had already monopolised the piano too long , but it was of no avail .
Parsing [sent. 1959 len. 13]: The more she hung back , the more eager became her audience .
Parsing [sent. 1960 len. 29]: `` The sooner begun , the sooner it 's done , '' she said to herself , with a sigh of resignation , and began to sing forthwith .
Parsing [sent. 1961 len. 43]: Theo had clothed the idea in simple and touching words , and Hope had seconded her with something akin to inspiration ; the last few lines , with their subtle change of key , containing an effect at once charming and pathetic .
Parsing [sent. 1962 len. 46]: `` So to us all comes the end of the day , '' Bang Hope softly -- so softly that the crackle of the firewood sounded loudly in the ears of the listeners : `` So to us all comes the end of the day .
Parsing [sent. 1963 len. 35]: When our playmates are lost , and our toys cast away ; Tired children of earth , when the shadows fall deep , The Father in Heaven will grant to us -- sleep ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1964 len. 29]: The pause before the last word gave to it an added emphasis , and Hope let her hands fall on her lap with a sigh of pent-up emotion .
Parsing [sent. 1965 len. 19]: Her eyes were bright with unshed tears ; but there were no signs of emotion in the audience .
Parsing [sent. 1966 len. 6]: `` How sweetly pretty ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1967 len. 14]: cried Truda in the very accents which the singer had heard in imagination .
Parsing [sent. 1968 len. 4]: `` I say !
Parsing [sent. 1969 len. 8]: Quite touching , is n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1970 len. 8]: said the youth with the fair moustache .
Parsing [sent. 1971 len. 12]: There was a babel of `` Thanks -- thanks awfully ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1972 len. 15]: and Aunt Loftus said graciously , `` You must be tired , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 1973 len. 5]: Come and sit down .
Parsing [sent. 1974 len. 9]: We must really give you a rest . ''
Parsing [sent. 1975 len. 31]: For five minutes afterwards Hope was the centre of an admiring throng , and tasted the bitter-sweet of an applause which failed to appreciate the true merit of her work .
Parsing [sent. 1976 len. 59]: It was pleasant enough , so far as it went , but it left a disappointed ache behind , and she was not sorry when Truda asserted her rights , and by means of a trick with a lead pencil , a piece of paper , and a hand-glass succeeded once more in gathering the company round herself .
Parsing [sent. 1977 len. 24]: Hope remained on the outside of the circle , a little tired after her exertions , and thankful for a moment 's breathing-space .
Parsing [sent. 1978 len. 21]: As she stood she became conscious of a steady gaze levelled upon her from the other end of the room .
Parsing [sent. 1979 len. 30]: Mr Merrilies had not taken up a position with the other men , but was leaning against the mantelpiece , studying her face with a grave , intent questioning .
Parsing [sent. 1980 len. 46]: For a moment each looked deep into the other 's eyes ; the rest of the figures in the room seemed to fade away , and these two saw each other as they really were , shorn of all the pretence and artificiality of society .
Parsing [sent. 1981 len. 21]: `` It is true , '' he said to himself : `` her mind is as lovely as her face .
Parsing [sent. 1982 len. 29]: She could not have composed that song -- she could not have sung it as she did -- if she were not everything that is sweet and good .
Parsing [sent. 1983 len. 4]: _ Hope _ !
Parsing [sent. 1984 len. 38]: I wonder -- I wonder if -- at last -- '' He raised his arm from the mantelpiece and walked forward to join the group by the table , while Hope shrank still farther into the shadow .
Parsing [sent. 1985 len. 12]: Her cheeks flushed , her heart beat with an unaccustomed quickening .
Parsing [sent. 1986 len. 17]: `` I believe , '' she said to herself -- `` I believe he understood ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1987 len. 3]: CHAPTER ELEVEN .
Parsing [sent. 1988 len. 3]: NEW FRIENDSHIPS .
Parsing [sent. 1989 len. 21]: Three days passed , and Hope thoroughly enjoyed the novel experience of life in a crowded and constantly changing household .
Parsing [sent. 1990 len. 52]: Certain of the guests were fixtures , among whom were numbered Truda Bennett , Mr Merrilies , and the fair and facetious Reggie Blake ; but for the rest , every day saw fresh arrivals , fresh departures , all involving a certain amount of extra work to the busy servants .
Parsing [sent. 1991 len. 39]: Hope could not help realising the truth of Madge 's shrewd surmise that she had been asked to make herself of use , for her aunt did not foil to claim her services a dozen times a day .
Parsing [sent. 1992 len. 39]: She arranged the flowers , decorated the dinner-table , answered business letters , made up and unpacked parcels , and , in short , discharged all the little duties which ordinarily fall upon the daughter of the house .
Parsing [sent. 1993 len. 56]: The work kept her more or less separate from the rest of the party , and there were occasions when she listened longingly to the bursts of laughter which sounded from the hall or from the billiard-room when on a wet day the resourceful Truda organised a billiard tournament for the entertainment of the men .
Parsing [sent. 1994 len. 43]: But for the most part she was delighted to be of use , to watch her aunt 's hard manner gradually soften into something closely approaching affection , and to receive from time to time one of her cousin 's rare caresses .
Parsing [sent. 1995 len. 56]: Avice never offered to take any part in the work , but the listless eyes noted more than was imagined ; and looking back over the day 's history , Hope often realised that it was to a quiet word or suggestion from Avice 's lips that she owed what little pleasure came her way .
Parsing [sent. 1996 len. 40]: With Mr Merrilies she had few opportunities of conversation , for he was out shooting all day long ; and in the evening Truda claimed him for her own , and allowed him no chance of leaving her side .
Parsing [sent. 1997 len. 23]: She had dozens of what she called `` parlour tricks , '' and every evening produced some new device to attract attention .
Parsing [sent. 1998 len. 38]: Now it was a ring slung on a piece of string , which must be separated without undoing the knot ; now a feat of balancing ; now some marvellous thought-reading , carefully prearranged with a confederate .
Parsing [sent. 1999 len. 39]: She was a young person whom it was impossible to ignore , who systematically made herself the centre of attraction , laughing , talking at the pitch of her voice , and gesticulating with her little ringed hands .
Parsing [sent. 2000 len. 36]: Hope felt a curious fascination in watching Mr Merrilies ' expression as he passively played the part of assistant , and asked herself curiously if he returned Truda 's feeling of `` especial interest '' .
Parsing [sent. 2001 len. 4]: Impossible to say .
Parsing [sent. 2002 len. 33]: His inscrutable face was no index to his feelings , but if he showed no special pleasure in being thus singled out , he at least made no effort to escape it .
Parsing [sent. 2003 len. 46]: In spite of the warning which she had received , Hope could not help feeling more interest in this man than in any other member of the party ; and she realised , with a little thrill of satisfaction , that the interest was mutual .
Parsing [sent. 2004 len. 54]: If she took advantage of an unobserved moment to study him , he lost no opportunity of watching her in return , and the knowledge that his dark eyes were fixed on her as she talked , and sang , and moved about the room filled her with a new and delightful self-consciousness .
Parsing [sent. 2005 len. 57]: Now , Hope was a warm-hearted girl , and , as was only natural , had given many a thought to the lover of the future ; but it never occurred to her that there was any danger in the interest which she felt in Ralph Merrilies , or in her intense consciousness of his presence .
Parsing [sent. 2006 len. 48]: She deluded herself into the belief that she was less cordially disposed to him than to any other member of the party , for she had been warned that another girl considered him her individual property , and was by no means willing to share his attentions .
Parsing [sent. 2007 len. 25]: So it came to pass that she kept quietly in the background , and had little or nothing to say to Truda 's cavalier .
Parsing [sent. 2008 len. 29]: On the third evening of Hope 's stay at The Shanty the sportsmen came home unusually tired , and for once Truda 's after-dinner tricks failed to entertain .
Parsing [sent. 2009 len. 27]: The men had no inclination to exert their minds or their muscles either , and turning to Hope , begged her for `` a tune . ''
Parsing [sent. 2010 len. 24]: `` The worst of Miss Charrington , '' sighed Reggie Blake regretfully , `` is that she is so painfully classical and superior .
Parsing [sent. 2011 len. 23]: She never condescends to play a piece whose composer has n't seven syllables to his name and a sneeze in the middle .
Parsing [sent. 2012 len. 28]: They are very clever and all that sort of thing , do n't you know , but I always wonder when the tune is going to begin .
Parsing [sent. 2013 len. 4]: Squeak , squeak !
Parsing [sent. 2014 len. 8]: in the treble ; bang , bang !
Parsing [sent. 2015 len. 34]: in the bass ; a rolling like heavy machinery , and all sorts of jerks and breaks when you are least expecting them : that is what you call a ` Gigue . '
Parsing [sent. 2016 len. 26]: A bit of a scale repeated over and over again like the tune the old cow died of : that is a ` Fugue . '
Parsing [sent. 2017 len. 12]: I 've a musical sister at home , so I know .
Parsing [sent. 2018 len. 34]: Now , I do n't pretend to be classical ; I like a good , rousing air -- something that makes you want to stamp your feet and beat time with your head .
Parsing [sent. 2019 len. 8]: Look at Miss Charrington laughing at me !
Parsing [sent. 2020 len. 20]: I suppose as a matter of fact you do n't _ know _ any airs , Miss Charrington ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2021 len. 12]: `` I have a schoolboy brother , '' answered Hope demurely .
Parsing [sent. 2022 len. 34]: She wheeled round on the music-stool and looked at him with dancing eyes ; and when Hope looked mischievous , it was something very well worth seeing in those days of young womanhood .
Parsing [sent. 2023 len. 57]: `` I blush to say , '' she said slowly -- though as a matter of fact she did not blush at all , but looked particularly beaming and complacent -- `` I blush to say that there is not a single tune at present performed upon the barrel-organs with which I am not intimately acquainted .
Parsing [sent. 2024 len. 24]: I shall be happy to accompany you , and to coach you in the words , whenever you feel inclined to perform . ''
Parsing [sent. 2025 len. 3]: `` Hurrah !
Parsing [sent. 2026 len. 3]: Good business !
Parsing [sent. 2027 len. 5]: Will you really ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2028 len. 18]: cried Reggie , jumping to his feet and hurrying across to the piano , abeam with delight .
Parsing [sent. 2029 len. 12]: `` Can you manage ` Mrs ` Enry ` Awkins ' ?
Parsing [sent. 2030 len. 14]: That is my stock song , and I sing it wherever I go .
Parsing [sent. 2031 len. 19]: -- Mrs Loftus , you are dying to hear me sing ` Mrs ` Enry ` Awkins ' ?
Parsing [sent. 2032 len. 5]: I know you are .
Parsing [sent. 2033 len. 23]: -- Let 's tune up at once , Miss Charrington ; and a chorus , mind -- a rousing old chorus ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2034 len. 21]: Every one was laughing , and looking of a sudden bright and animated ; no one was sleepy any longer .
Parsing [sent. 2035 len. 31]: There was a secondary accompaniment of chuckles as Reggie screwed up his thin , ugly face into the most comical of grimaces and half-sang , half-recited the celebrated coster love-song .
Parsing [sent. 2036 len. 48]: Hope 's spirited playing made him sing his best , and her clear voice started the chorus with such spirit that presently every one was taking part , tentatively at first , then with quickly growing ardour , until at last the volume of sound became overpowering .
Parsing [sent. 2037 len. 20]: Uncle Loftus bellowed himself hoarse in his corner , and even his wife 's lips moved in sympathetic echo .
Parsing [sent. 2038 len. 23]: At the conclusion of the song there was an outburst of applause and laughter which made the performer beside himself with delight .
Parsing [sent. 2039 len. 35]: `` To think , '' he cried , `` that we have wasted our time over Wagner and Grieg , and all those foreign Johnnies , when we might have had music like this !
Parsing [sent. 2040 len. 15]: I 'll sing every night ; and we must work up some more choruses .
Parsing [sent. 2041 len. 14]: Mrs Loftus , have you any Gilbert and Sullivan operas in the house ?
Parsing [sent. 2042 len. 10]: Could n't we have a try at them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2043 len. 5]: Why not , indeed ?
Parsing [sent. 2044 len. 6]: No sooner said than done .
Parsing [sent. 2045 len. 33]: Out came the operas from the music cabinet , and as half-a-dozen voices urged the claims of half-a-dozen favourites , there was plainly nothing to be done but take each in turn .
Parsing [sent. 2046 len. 86]: The chorus was by way of being a scratch combination -- one treble ; one alto , who had to accompany as well as sing , and also to put in all the high notes , because the treble declared that she could not possibly `` go '' above F ; two tenors , by no means as correct as they might have been ; and an army of heavy , dragging bass -- but what was lacking in ability was made up by fervour .
Parsing [sent. 2047 len. 36]: Mr Merrilies did not sing , but he volunteered to turn over the pages , and seating himself by Hope 's side , watched her face for the signal which was to guide his inexperience .
Parsing [sent. 2048 len. 54]: At first this signal was a quick glance at his face , but as time went on this was replaced by a nod of the head or an upward jerk of the hand -- for there was something in the expression of those watchful eyes which was embarrassing to meet at close quarters .
Parsing [sent. 2049 len. 60]: They talked quietly together between the choruses , while the different parts were wrangling loudly , each laying the blame upon the other , and calling attention to his own superior performance : and it was not in girl nature to be ignorant of the fact that Ralph seemed far less concerned about the music than her own comfort .
Parsing [sent. 2050 len. 44]: The lamp was moved because it dazzled her eyes ; the book was raised to a more convenient angle ; a door was closed to avoid a draught ; and all in a quiet , unobtrusive manner that made the attention doubly acceptable .
Parsing [sent. 2051 len. 32]: Members of large families are not accustomed to have their wishes gratified almost before they are realised , and are all the more ready to appreciate such consideration from a stranger .
Parsing [sent. 2052 len. 73]: Hope played , and sang , and instructed -- gave leads , banged insistently upon notes which the singers rendered flat instead of sharp , and even finished a tenor solo which had hopelessly come to grief -- until hand and voice and head alike ached with fatigue ; but still the insatiable chorus clamoured for more , remembering another and another favourite which it would be a sin to leave untried .
Parsing [sent. 2053 len. 14]: `` You are tired , '' said a low voice in her ear .
Parsing [sent. 2054 len. 33]: `` You shall not play any longer ; '' and before she had time to protest , Ralph Merrilies had risen from his seat and closed the book with a determined hand .
Parsing [sent. 2055 len. 7]: `` It is nearly eleven o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 2056 len. 11]: Do you realise how long you have kept Miss Charrington ?
Parsing [sent. 2057 len. 7]: She has surely earned a rest .
Parsing [sent. 2058 len. 16]: Do come and sit down , Miss Charrington ; your back must need support . ''
Parsing [sent. 2059 len. 9]: `` Better come upstairs with me , Hope .
Parsing [sent. 2060 len. 23]: I am just going , '' said Avice , rising from the sofa and slipping her hand through her cousin 's arm .
Parsing [sent. 2061 len. 48]: The singers , contrite at their own lack of consideration , busied themselves putting away the music , and gathered into little groups round the piano , so that Mr Merrilies and the two girls were alone in their corner , and their conversation was not overheard .
Parsing [sent. 2062 len. 58]: `` I am afraid we have been very selfish , '' he said , looking at Hope 's tired face ; `` but the music has been such a pleasure that we have gone on and on without noticing the time , and Miss Charrington was too good-natured to remind us that she was growing tired . ''
Parsing [sent. 2063 len. 33]: `` Hope never thinks of herself , '' said Avice quietly ; and the colour flamed into Hope 's white cheeks and her blue eyes brightened with pleasure at this unexpected tribute .
Parsing [sent. 2064 len. 18]: Avice -- Avice the languid , the undemonstrative -- to praise her aloud , and in company !
Parsing [sent. 2065 len. 26]: She was too much taken aback to protest in the conventional way , but she noticed that Mr Merrilies looked even more pleased than herself .
Parsing [sent. 2066 len. 29]: He smiled at Avice with a new interest in his eyes , and said quickly : `` In that case it is our duty to look after her .
Parsing [sent. 2067 len. 10]: I should suggest fresh air in the first place .
Parsing [sent. 2068 len. 14]: How is it that she never joins us at our out-of-door luncheons ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2069 len. 15]: `` She stays at home to help mother ; but she shall come to-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 2070 len. 24]: I will bring her , '' replied Avice in a voice that for once was not languid , but quite brisk and decided .
Parsing [sent. 2071 len. 5]: Wonders would never cease !
Parsing [sent. 2072 len. 33]: Could it be that friendship for a girl of her own age was about to rouse the listless Avice to an active interest in the life which was going on around her !
Parsing [sent. 2073 len. 3]: CHAPTER TWELVE .
Parsing [sent. 2074 len. 4]: A SHOOTING LUNCHEON .
Parsing [sent. 2075 len. 24]: It was with the exultation of a child on a holiday that Hope prepared to start for the picnic lunch the next day .
Parsing [sent. 2076 len. 25]: Hitherto she had watched the departure of the other ladies with a spasm of not unnatural envy , but now she was going herself .
Parsing [sent. 2077 len. 31]: The day was bright and mild , and it was so pleasant to drive in the open behind Pipeclay , the little white pony which was Avice 's special favourite .
Parsing [sent. 2078 len. 40]: Truda had driven on ahead with the luncheon-baskets , accompanied by a young married lady who was the latest addition to the house-party , so the two cousins were alone , and could talk together without fear of interruption .
Parsing [sent. 2079 len. 28]: Hope was all brightness and animation , for she was experiencing at that moment a mysterious lightness of heart which made her see everything through rose-coloured spectacles .
Parsing [sent. 2080 len. 42]: She admired everything -- the grey stretches of the landscape , the outline of the trees against the skies , the tumble-down cottages by the roadside -- while Avice listened to her animated talk with a wistful smile on her face .
Parsing [sent. 2081 len. 7]: `` You enjoy everything , Hope .
Parsing [sent. 2082 len. 6]: How do you manage it ?
Parsing [sent. 2083 len. 18]: I wish I knew your secret , for to me it all seems so stale and uninteresting .
Parsing [sent. 2084 len. 25]: I do not believe there is anything in the world which would make me so bright and happy as you seem this morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 2085 len. 4]: `` Nothing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2086 len. 5]: `` No -- nothing .
Parsing [sent. 2087 len. 46]: I enjoy some things more than others , of course ; but , honestly , for me the happiest moment of the day is when I lie down in bed and feel that for eight hours at least I need do nothing but rest . ''
Parsing [sent. 2088 len. 5]: `` Poor darling ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2089 len. 8]: cried Hope sympathetically -- `` poor darling !
Parsing [sent. 2090 len. 10]: That is a matter of health , of course .
Parsing [sent. 2091 len. 22]: But , Avice , do n't you think that perhaps if you -- '' `` Yes ; if I what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2092 len. 10]: Hope knitted her brows and looked distressed and nervous .
Parsing [sent. 2093 len. 56]: `` Oh , I do n't want to preach , but perhaps if you had something to do -- if you did not think quite so much of -- I mean to say that if one is feeling weak and listless , and has nothing to do , one goes on feeling worse and worse .
Parsing [sent. 2094 len. 24]: But if one gets interested -- '' `` Yes , I know what you mean ; but how is one to get interested ?
Parsing [sent. 2095 len. 5]: That is the question .
Parsing [sent. 2096 len. 24]: I am not clever like you , and have no hobbies to occupy my mind , and I get so bored with myself .
Parsing [sent. 2097 len. 8]: Mother wo n't let me help her .
Parsing [sent. 2098 len. 40]: She thinks I am too delicate ; and , apart from that , she is quick and I am slow , and it would fidget her to see me droning through what she could do in half the time .
Parsing [sent. 2099 len. 14]: It is all very well to say , ` Have an interest . '
Parsing [sent. 2100 len. 14]: Everything that seems new and exciting to you here is stale to me .
Parsing [sent. 2101 len. 35]: I am sick to death of living in public as we do , entertaining one set of visitors after another , who all say the same things and amuse themselves in the same way .
Parsing [sent. 2102 len. 20]: I am not strong enough to go out ` slumming ' or visiting hospitals , as some girls do .
Parsing [sent. 2103 len. 18]: Where would _ you _ find your interest if you were in my place , Hope ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2104 len. 12]: `` I 'd find it somewhere , '' said Hope sturdily .
Parsing [sent. 2105 len. 24]: `` You have plenty of money and plenty of time , and there must be a hundred ways of putting them to account .
Parsing [sent. 2106 len. 23]: I -- I think I would try to help girls who are alone in the world and struggling to make their living .
Parsing [sent. 2107 len. 69]: We are all together , and have enough money to keep us from actual want , but I can imagine how _ awful _ it must be for girls who are all alone , with no one to help them if they fall ill ; whose lives are one long , colourless struggle , with never a ray of brightness or pleasure from Monday morning until Saturday night .
Parsing [sent. 2108 len. 11]: Could you not think of some way of helping them ?
Parsing [sent. 2109 len. 5]: What could you do ?
Parsing [sent. 2110 len. 7]: I know ; I have it !
Parsing [sent. 2111 len. 44]: There is that sweet little lodge with no one living in it but old George and his wife , and she was lamenting to me only yesterday that her daughters were married , and there were no young folks left in the house .
Parsing [sent. 2112 len. 38]: Why should you not furnish two rooms upstairs , and invite poor shop assistants and girl-clerks to come down for their holidays , two at a time , so that they would be companions for each other ?
Parsing [sent. 2113 len. 30]: It would be so easy to manage , for you need not think of expense ; and Mrs Moss would wait upon them , while you provided their amusements .
Parsing [sent. 2114 len. 31]: You could go round with Pipeclay and take them out for drives ; you could lend them books and papers , and have them up to the house to tea .
Parsing [sent. 2115 len. 29]: They would confide their joys and troubles to you , and tell you about their ` friends , ' and write letters to you when they went home .
Parsing [sent. 2116 len. 12]: When they married , you could help to provide the trousseaux .
Parsing [sent. 2117 len. 22]: And when the first little girls were born they would be called after you , and you would knit their socks .
Parsing [sent. 2118 len. 43]: They would be brought up to love you because you had been kind to their mothers , and it would be the dream of their lives to be asked down to see all the places of which they had heard so much .
Parsing [sent. 2119 len. 30]: In a dozen homes all over the country people would be blessing you , and looking upon you as the good fairy who had brought them health and happiness .
Parsing [sent. 2120 len. 7]: Oh Avice , you lucky girl !
Parsing [sent. 2121 len. 10]: What would I give to have such a chance ?
Parsing [sent. 2122 len. 12]: I would begin to-morrow -- to-day -- this very afternoon ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2123 len. 12]: `` Well , '' said Avice reflectively -- `` well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2124 len. 32]: It was not in her nature to be enthusiastic like her cousin , but she smiled as if the idea found favour in her sight , and her dull eyes brightened .
Parsing [sent. 2125 len. 8]: `` It _ does _ sound nice .
Parsing [sent. 2126 len. 10]: I suppose I could do it if I liked .
Parsing [sent. 2127 len. 12]: Mother would n't mind , and Mrs Moss would be delighted .
Parsing [sent. 2128 len. 55]: She is one of those women who are never so happy as when they are nursing some one ; and she would coddle the girls from morning till night , and give them beaten-up eggs and black-currant Jelly for their throats , and her celebrated cough mixture made out of nine ` ingrediencies ' !
Parsing [sent. 2129 len. 9]: I really will think about it , Hope .
Parsing [sent. 2130 len. 7]: I believe it would be interesting .
Parsing [sent. 2131 len. 16]: Would you help me to furnish the rooms and make them pretty and artistic ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2132 len. 3]: `` Rather !
Parsing [sent. 2133 len. 13]: I adore buying things -- when some one else has to pay .
Parsing [sent. 2134 len. 51]: We would have one room blue , and one pink , with white paint and dear little white beds , and bookcases full of nice books , and comfy wicker chairs by the window , where the girls could sit and read , and rest their poor , tired backs .
Parsing [sent. 2135 len. 15]: And I would be your town agent , and look out for likely subjects .
Parsing [sent. 2136 len. 74]: If I were in a shop and saw a poor , anaemic-looking girl , I could find out her circumstances from the manager or head of the department ; and if she had no one to look after her , and was living in the shop , or in poky little lodgings , I could send on her name to you , and you would invite her to come here for the holidays .
Parsing [sent. 2137 len. 12]: Oh , you are going to do it , my dear !
Parsing [sent. 2138 len. 9]: You 'll _ have _ to do it !
Parsing [sent. 2139 len. 11]: I 'll give you no peace till you do . ''
Parsing [sent. 2140 len. 7]: `` I 'll think about it .
Parsing [sent. 2141 len. 28]: I ca n't decide things in a moment ; but I would like to work with you , Hope , and it does n't sound too formidable .
Parsing [sent. 2142 len. 14]: I really think I could arrange a pleasant holiday for the girls . ''
Parsing [sent. 2143 len. 41]: `` I really think you might , '' agreed Hope , laughing ; and then suddenly came a halloa of welcome , and over the fence appeared one head after another as the shooting party rose to receive the new-comers .
Parsing [sent. 2144 len. 45]: Truda and Mrs Inglis had arrived some ten minutes earlier , and luncheon was laid on a cloth under the shelter of the hedge , mackintosh sheets being spread upon the ground , on which the guests could sit without fear of rheumatic consequences .
Parsing [sent. 2145 len. 48]: A few yards away the beaters were already refreshing themselves with Irish stew and copious draughts of beer , while from the hampers had come forth all manner of tempting viands , to which the sportsmen did ample justice , the while they protested at such dainties .
Parsing [sent. 2146 len. 7]: `` Mrs Loftus spoils us altogether .
Parsing [sent. 2147 len. 11]: I do n't approve of luxuries at a shooting lunch .
Parsing [sent. 2148 len. 18]: We are getting too soft as a nation ; that is what is the matter with us .
Parsing [sent. 2149 len. 14]: It would be a lot better if we went back to simpler ways .
Parsing [sent. 2150 len. 16]: -- Cut me a chunk more of that galantine , that 's a good fellow .
Parsing [sent. 2151 len. 17]: A _ chunk _ , I said ; cut it thicker , ca n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2152 len. 25]: and Reggie Blake bent forward to superintend the carver 's movements with an anxiety of expression which evoked a hearty laugh from his companions .
Parsing [sent. 2153 len. 45]: Mrs Nash , the new-comer , was offering `` a handsome wife and ten thousand a year , '' in the shape of the lost roll upon a plate , to an old bachelor of sixty , who appeared much delighted at the prospect .
Parsing [sent. 2154 len. 42]: Truda was playing tunes on the rim of her tumbler ; Avice had actually a tinge of colour in her checks ; and Hope sat perched on a cushion , looking down on them all like a queen on her throne .
Parsing [sent. 2155 len. 34]: Before the meal had begun she had found herself seated uncomfortably between two of the least interesting of the sportsmen ; but she had hardly time to realise her disappointment before -- presto !
Parsing [sent. 2156 len. 5]: the scene was changed .
Parsing [sent. 2157 len. 31]: Mr Merrilies had strolled towards the pony-cart , and returned with an armful of cushions , which he placed on the ground close to where he himself had been sitting .
Parsing [sent. 2158 len. 4]: `` There ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2159 len. 12]: he said ; `` those are for you , Miss Charrington .
Parsing [sent. 2160 len. 25]: You have evidently not mastered the art of lunching comfortably on the ground , and we shall have to break you in by degrees .
Parsing [sent. 2161 len. 7]: Let me take your plate . ''
Parsing [sent. 2162 len. 26]: Thus in the most open and natural fashion the change was effected which was fraught with so much satisfaction to the two people most concerned .
Parsing [sent. 2163 len. 46]: It was so much pleasanter than the old position , thought innocent Hope -- the view was more extended , more beautiful , more sunny and cheerful ; and to judge from his unusual animation , Ralph Merrilies was of the same mind as herself .
Parsing [sent. 2164 len. 31]: There was no chance of private conversation ; but there are occasions when the most commonplace phrases become interesting and the very passing of the mustard is a thrilling incident !
Parsing [sent. 2165 len. 27]: When lunch was over the ladies agreed to walk a little way with the men , leaving the carts to pick them up at another point .
Parsing [sent. 2166 len. 34]: Once again Hope found herself carried off by Ralph Merrilies , and guided by such a circuitous path that the other members of the party were soon ahead and safely out of hearing .
Parsing [sent. 2167 len. 39]: For a time they talked of matters connected with the day 's sport , but gradually the conversation took a more personal tone , and Hope found Mr Merrilies confiding details of his life to her attentive ears .
Parsing [sent. 2168 len. 77]: It appeared that his parents were dead , and that he owned an estate in Hampshire , where he lived in much luxury , and greater boredom , during such portions of the year as he was not visiting or risking his life abroad in search of adventure ; that he was , in short , one of those wealthy , idle men of whom she had often read , but whom she had never met .
Parsing [sent. 2169 len. 19]: As for him , he was charmed by her naive interest and curiosity concerning himself and his doings .
Parsing [sent. 2170 len. 52]: She asked for a description of the house , of his housekeeper-aunt 's appearance , character , and attainments ; she wondered how he employed himself all day , suggested improvements in his grounds , and was much concerned to hear of a fire among the stacks at the home farm .
Parsing [sent. 2171 len. 24]: Then he adroitly led the conversation to herself , beginning with a reference to the subject in which she appeared most deeply interested .
Parsing [sent. 2172 len. 9]: `` I suppose you amuse yourself with music .
Parsing [sent. 2173 len. 18]: As you sing and play and compose , you have plenty of variety to keep you going .
Parsing [sent. 2174 len. 30]: The worst of possessing so many talents is , that they are so much appreciated by other people that they want to work you to death for their amusement .
Parsing [sent. 2175 len. 6]: Last night , for instance !
Parsing [sent. 2176 len. 25]: It was too bad to keep you at the piano all evening , and treat you as though you were a professional accompanist . ''
Parsing [sent. 2177 len. 38]: `` I wish I was , '' sighed Hope wistfully ; and when her companion looked at her with a start of surprise , `` That is what I want to be , '' she added simply .
Parsing [sent. 2178 len. 32]: `` I have to earn my living in some way , and neither my voice nor my playing is good enough for public performances ; but I _ can _ accompany .
Parsing [sent. 2179 len. 17]: I should be thankful if any one _ would _ hire me for the purpose . ''
Parsing [sent. 2180 len. 9]: Ralph Merrilies looked at her in silent astonishment .
Parsing [sent. 2181 len. 25]: He had taken for granted that , as the niece of the wealthy Mr Loftus , Hope Charrington occupied the same position in society .
Parsing [sent. 2182 len. 23]: Man-like , he had noticed none of the signs of poverty in her attire which were plain as print to feminine eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2183 len. 11]: What if her attire was always of the simplest description ?
Parsing [sent. 2184 len. 12]: She invariably looked better than any other girl in the room .
Parsing [sent. 2185 len. 43]: If one solitary dress did duty every evening , a new arrangement of laces transformed it in his eyes ; and if she wore no jewels , the round white throat and arms looked all the better for their lack of adornment .
Parsing [sent. 2186 len. 17]: It gave him a shock of surprise to hear her speak of making her own livelihood .
Parsing [sent. 2187 len. 8]: `` Do you really mean that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2188 len. 24]: he asked gravely ; and in reply Hope gave him a short biographical sketch , which explained the present position of the family .
Parsing [sent. 2189 len. 33]: `` So you see I am responsible for a share of our expenses , '' she said in conclusion , `` and it is not so easy to earn as I expected .
Parsing [sent. 2190 len. 50]: I thought I should have little difficulty in getting songs published , but I find it is very difficult indeed ; and even if I sold one or two in the year , they would bring in very little , so I must find something that is more certain .
Parsing [sent. 2191 len. 33]: I should make a good accompanist , for I can read at sight and transpose as I go , and know when to humour a singer and when to pull him up .
Parsing [sent. 2192 len. 9]: But the difficulty is to find an opening .
Parsing [sent. 2193 len. 13]: I do hope that I may not be reduced to giving lessons !
Parsing [sent. 2194 len. 18]: That would be a real trial of patience , and the prospect is so hopelessly limited . ''
Parsing [sent. 2195 len. 9]: `` Oh , you must not give lessons !
Parsing [sent. 2196 len. 18]: That would never do , '' said Ralph , drawing his brows together in a disapproving frown .
Parsing [sent. 2197 len. 15]: That she should need to work at all was an idea still disagreeably new .
Parsing [sent. 2198 len. 8]: `` You speak of becoming an accompanist .
Parsing [sent. 2199 len. 6]: What does that mean exactly !
Parsing [sent. 2200 len. 20]: Is there an opening for accompaniment playing , apart from taking a more prominent place in a programme ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2201 len. 4]: `` Oh yes .
Parsing [sent. 2202 len. 22]: Professionals often insist upon having their own accompanists , for it is so easy for a stranger to spoil their effects .
Parsing [sent. 2203 len. 8]: Even among amateurs they are occasionally required .
Parsing [sent. 2204 len. 62]: Suppose a lady gets up a concert for charity , or gives a musical ` At Home , ' or has private theatricals , it is an immense help to have some one who can play for all the performers alike , improvise a few bars if things go wrong , and fill up awkward gaps by appropriate ` selections . '
Parsing [sent. 2205 len. 22]: That is the work which would suit me best , if I could make a start and become fairly well-known . ''
Parsing [sent. 2206 len. 4]: `` I see .
Parsing [sent. 2207 len. 31]: Yes , as you explain it , there certainly is an opening in that direction ; but forgive me for saying that the position seems too subordinate for your talent .
Parsing [sent. 2208 len. 7]: Why should you not sing yourself ?
Parsing [sent. 2209 len. 22]: You would be better paid , and it seems to me that you are very well fitted to do so . ''
Parsing [sent. 2210 len. 8]: Hope shook her head with pathetic candour .
Parsing [sent. 2211 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 2212 len. 7]: My voice is not strong enough .
Parsing [sent. 2213 len. 48]: I am a fair amateur , but most people can find friends to sing for them quite as well as I could do ; and if they hire professionals at all , they want something better -- a beautiful voice like Minnie Caldecott 's , for instance .
Parsing [sent. 2214 len. 24]: As you said yourself the day I arrived , it is a fastidious age , and mediocrity can not hope for success . ''
Parsing [sent. 2215 len. 6]: `` Did I say that ?
Parsing [sent. 2216 len. 6]: What a singularly unhappy remark !
Parsing [sent. 2217 len. 20]: You must forgive it , please , because of course I had no idea what was in your mind .
Parsing [sent. 2218 len. 18]: I do n't think , however , that you ought to use the word ` mediocre . '
Parsing [sent. 2219 len. 8]: It is more a question of appropriateness .
Parsing [sent. 2220 len. 38]: Your voice may not be suited for big entertainments -- and , to speak quite frankly , I can hardly imagine your facing such an ordeal -- but surely there are quieter ways of setting to work .
Parsing [sent. 2221 len. 10]: What about children , now -- children 's parties ?
Parsing [sent. 2222 len. 26]: My little nieces have a party every year , and it is a serious business to find a change from the everlasting conjurer and magic-lantern .
Parsing [sent. 2223 len. 14]: Could you not find some songs which they would like to hear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2224 len. 25]: He looked at her inquiringly , and Hope stood still in the middle of the lane and stared at him with kindling eyes . ''
Parsing [sent. 2225 len. 5]: _ Children _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2226 len. 12]: she whispered beneath her breath -- '' _ children _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2227 len. 42]: It was the prettiest thing in the world to see the different emotions chase each other over the sweet face : surprise first , and puzzled questioning ; then the gradual dawning of an idea , the flush of radiant triumph .
Parsing [sent. 2228 len. 5]: `` Children 's parties !
Parsing [sent. 2229 len. 6]: Oh , what an idea !
Parsing [sent. 2230 len. 16]: What a brilliant , brilliant ideal Mr Merrilies , how can I ever thank you ?
Parsing [sent. 2231 len. 37]: I do n't know why I did not think of it myself , for it is the very thing I should love above all others ; and I believe I could make it a success . ''
Parsing [sent. 2232 len. 21]: She turned and began to walk rapidly forward , waving her hands and unfolding her programme with characteristic Charrington enthusiasm .
Parsing [sent. 2233 len. 12]: `` I know what I will do -- I know exactly .
Parsing [sent. 2234 len. 15]: I will tell them a story , and sing descriptive little songs at intervals .
Parsing [sent. 2235 len. 36]: Theo shall write the words and share in the profits ; and the songs shall be set to well-known airs , for children love what they know , and would enjoy joining in the choruses .
Parsing [sent. 2236 len. 7]: Oh , it will be charming !
Parsing [sent. 2237 len. 32]: -- a new fairy tale introducing all the dear old characters -- the Giant who lives alone in his Castle , and eats up every one who comes in his way .
Parsing [sent. 2238 len. 4]: ` Fe-fo-fum ! '
Parsing [sent. 2239 len. 18]: that shall be his song -- ` Fe-fo-fum , I smell the blood of an Englishman ! '
Parsing [sent. 2240 len. 11]: Ca n't you hear the deep chords in the bass ?
Parsing [sent. 2241 len. 49]: Then there must be the Prince , of course , and the most beautiful Princess that ever was seen -- '' `` With golden hair and dark-blue eyes , '' put in the listener , with a look in his eyes that passed unnoticed by his excited companion .
Parsing [sent. 2242 len. 29]: `` Yes , yes ; and -- and a wicked fairy who was not asked to the christening , and a good fairy who undid all her spells .
Parsing [sent. 2243 len. 7]: Theo will bring them all in .
Parsing [sent. 2244 len. 19]: I will write to her this very night , for there is not a minute to be lost .
Parsing [sent. 2245 len. 23]: I shall have no difficulty in setting the songs to music , and should not feel a scrap nervous singing to children .
Parsing [sent. 2246 len. 4]: Deal little souls !
Parsing [sent. 2247 len. 16]: What fun it will be watching their faces and hearing them join in the choruses !
Parsing [sent. 2248 len. 7]: Oh , what a charming ideal !
Parsing [sent. 2249 len. 13]: Do you really think any one would allow me to try ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2250 len. 14]: `` I will give you your first engagement now , at this moment !
Parsing [sent. 2251 len. 22]: My sister will be only too eager to secure you ; and she will tell her friends of the new idea .
Parsing [sent. 2252 len. 29]: I shall say that your fee is rather high , but that at all costs you must be engaged if she wishes the party to be a success .
Parsing [sent. 2253 len. 22]: You must charge a good deal , you know , or people wo n't think half so much of you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2254 len. 8]: Hope looked at him with shy delight .
Parsing [sent. 2255 len. 4]: `` Must I ?
Parsing [sent. 2256 len. 5]: I should like that .
Parsing [sent. 2257 len. 18]: Mr Merrilies , I am so grateful to you that I do n't know what to say .
Parsing [sent. 2258 len. 8]: You have made me feel so happy .
Parsing [sent. 2259 len. 15]: If I get on at all , it will be all your doing . ''
Parsing [sent. 2260 len. 9]: `` It will be nothing of the kind .
Parsing [sent. 2261 len. 18]: I simply mentioned the word children , and you pounced upon it and evolved the whole scheme .
Parsing [sent. 2262 len. 14]: There is no gratitude due to me , '' declared Ralph Merrilies sturdily .
Parsing [sent. 2263 len. 29]: At that moment voices broke upon the ear , and turning a corner , they saw the three remaining ladies of the party walking back to meet them .
Parsing [sent. 2264 len. 26]: Avice came forward to ask Mr Merrilies some question about the carriage , while Truda turned to Hope and studied her face with gloomy eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2265 len. 6]: `` You look very jubilant .
Parsing [sent. 2266 len. 9]: What is the matter with you to-day ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2267 len. 8]: `` I 've got an idea ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2268 len. 3]: `` Goodness !
Parsing [sent. 2269 len. 4]: Is that all ?
Parsing [sent. 2270 len. 6]: I 've got hundreds . ''
Parsing [sent. 2271 len. 29]: She fell a few steps behind the others , and added resentfully , `` You have managed to keep him pretty well to yourself , at any rate .
Parsing [sent. 2272 len. 11]: He has n't spoken a word to me all day .
Parsing [sent. 2273 len. 10]: I do n't call that keeping your promise . ''
Parsing [sent. 2274 len. 3]: CHAPTER THIRTEEN .
Parsing [sent. 2275 len. 4]: PRICKINGS OF CONSCIENCE .
Parsing [sent. 2276 len. 30]: Truda was very silent all the way home ; in plain words , she sulked , and refused to give more than monosyllabic replies to Hope 's gentle overtures .
Parsing [sent. 2277 len. 36]: When the house was reached she pleaded headache -- that convenient cloak for every feminine ill , from a heartache to had temper -- and retired to her room for the remainder of the afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 2278 len. 42]: Hope went into the empty library and wrote a long letter home , telling all about her new plans , asking Theo 's co-operation , and sending a list of certain points to which she wished special attention to be given .
Parsing [sent. 2279 len. 54]: She wrote with interest , it is true , but with none of the elation which she had known an hour earlier ; for at the back of her mind lay a consciousness that something disagreeable lay before her -- a painful situation to be faced so soon as leisure should be hers .
Parsing [sent. 2280 len. 44]: When later on she sat before her bedroom fire , in the interval before dressing for dinner , she stared into the heart of the glowing coals and thrashed out the subject -- quietly , sweetly , fairly , as her nature was .
Parsing [sent. 2281 len. 27]: Truda was annoyed , and considered that she had been unfairly treated , in that another had monopolised something to which she possessed a prior claim .
Parsing [sent. 2282 len. 41]: After that first very candid statement she had naturally relied on the loyalty of the girl in whom she had confided , and although no actual promise had been given , that girl had also considered herself bound in honour .
Parsing [sent. 2283 len. 5]: Had she kept faith ?
Parsing [sent. 2284 len. 55]: For the most part Hope could honestly answer in the affirmative , but looking back over the last few days , she acknowledged that she had been sufficiently `` off guard '' to allow herself to be monopolised without protest , and so had engrossed the lion 's share of Ralph Merrilies ' attention .
Parsing [sent. 2285 len. 5]: _ Without protest _ !
Parsing [sent. 2286 len. 15]: The blood rushed over Hope 's face at the misleading sound of the words .
Parsing [sent. 2287 len. 24]: There had been no thought of protest -- no wish for it -- nothing but purest delight and satisfaction in being thus monopolised .
Parsing [sent. 2288 len. 24]: So far from feeling any dismay , her heart had given a leap of triumph each time he had come to her side .
Parsing [sent. 2289 len. 5]: What did this mean ?
Parsing [sent. 2290 len. 11]: Did it -- could it possibly be falling in love ?
Parsing [sent. 2291 len. 18]: Was she beginning to care more for Ralph Merrilies than for any man whom she had known ?
Parsing [sent. 2292 len. 24]: She mentally placed the image of one masculine friend after the other beside this acquaintance of a week 's standing , and lo !
Parsing [sent. 2293 len. 25]: they were as nothing -- their weal or woe touched her not at all , compared with the lightest interest of this comparative stranger .
Parsing [sent. 2294 len. 6]: _ Beginning _ to care !
Parsing [sent. 2295 len. 23]: She cared already -- cared with all her heart -- cared more than she had even known it was possible to care .
Parsing [sent. 2296 len. 15]: Realising this , Hope grew frightened , and clasped trembling hands in her lap .
Parsing [sent. 2297 len. 19]: What madness was it , what will-o ' - the-wisp , for which she had bartered her peace ?
Parsing [sent. 2298 len. 51]: She , Hope Charrington , poor , insignificant , friendless , and he the owner of a fine estate , handsome , distinguished , influential , with the _ entree _ into any society which he desired to affect , the world a playground over which to roam at will !
Parsing [sent. 2299 len. 31]: With such a choice before him , such a stage on which to play his life , how was it possible that he could cast a thought in her direction ?
Parsing [sent. 2300 len. 40]: What attention he had paid her had been but that which a man would naturally show towards any girl who happened to be to him -- for the time at least -- the most interesting member of a house-party .
Parsing [sent. 2301 len. 62]: Hope did not delude herself that Ralph had any penchant for the lively Truda , but since the two moved in the same circle , and had many opportunities of meeting , it was possible that in time to come he might return the girl 's fancy ; in any case she could not be the one to stand between them .
Parsing [sent. 2302 len. 11]: `` I 'll go home , '' decided Hope drearily .
Parsing [sent. 2303 len. 35]: `` My time is up on Tuesday , and though I know Avice will beg me to stay longer , this children 's entertainment will be a good excuse for getting back to town .
Parsing [sent. 2304 len. 27]: I 'll keep out of his way as much as possible until I go , and forget all about him when I step into the train .
Parsing [sent. 2305 len. 3]: Ten days !
Parsing [sent. 2306 len. 4]: Only ten days !
Parsing [sent. 2307 len. 13]: It must be easy enough to forget a little time like that .
Parsing [sent. 2308 len. 15]: It would be cowardly to let ten days interfere with one 's life . ''
Parsing [sent. 2309 len. 37]: She was very quiet that evening , very subdued all next day , and so much engrossed in helping her aunt that she was hardly seen by the rest of the guests until evening came round .
Parsing [sent. 2310 len. 56]: That she had been missed was evident , but while the other men loudly regretted her absence , and plied her with tiresome questions as to its cause , Ralph was silent , watching her face with an anxious glance , and attending to her comfort with even more than his usual quietly unobtrusive care .
Parsing [sent. 2311 len. 50]: Hope felt that he had divined a secret trouble , and she was sure of it the next morning after breakfast , when , Mrs Loftus having sent her into the library to write some notes , he suddenly remembered his own correspondence and followed her into the room .
Parsing [sent. 2312 len. 65]: Hope would have settled down to work at once , but she could not be so ungracious as to refuse to help in his search for some mislaid articles , and in the middle of commonplaces another question was put , suddenly , briefly , but with an earnestness of manner which showed what was his real purpose in following her to the library .
Parsing [sent. 2313 len. 11]: `` You are not yourself ; something is troubling you .
Parsing [sent. 2314 len. 7]: Have you had bad news ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2315 len. 13]: Hope fell back a pace and looked at him with startled eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2316 len. 17]: Before his earnest scrutiny ordinary denials became impossible ; she could answer nothing but the truth .
Parsing [sent. 2317 len. 14]: `` Not bad news -- no ; but something troubles me a little .
Parsing [sent. 2318 len. 11]: Please take no notice ; it will pass away . ''
Parsing [sent. 2319 len. 11]: `` Is it nothing in which I can help ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2320 len. 17]: A faint smile flitted across Hope 's charming face , and she shook her golden head .
Parsing [sent. 2321 len. 29]: `` You are very kind , but -- '' `` If I can help at any time , in any way , will you give me the opportunity ?
Parsing [sent. 2322 len. 14]: Will you believe that nothing could possibly give me so much pleasure ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2323 len. 37]: He stepped towards her as he spoke ; but even as he did so there came from without the sound of Truda 's voice , loud and insistent , approaching nearer and nearer to the room .
Parsing [sent. 2324 len. 45]: With a shiver of dismay , Hope realised that in another moment the door might be thrown open and a _ tete-a-tete _ discovered , which , however innocent in reality , would certainly have a romantic appearance in the eyes of a beholder .
Parsing [sent. 2325 len. 16]: She broke into a forced laugh and turned aside to seat herself at the desk .
Parsing [sent. 2326 len. 6]: `` Oh , thank you !
Parsing [sent. 2327 len. 17]: You _ have _ helped me already by your charming suggestion about the children 's entertainment .
Parsing [sent. 2328 len. 20]: I have written to my sister , and hope to find the story ready when I get home . ''
Parsing [sent. 2329 len. 49]: Even to her own ears the reply sounded curt and ungracious , an obvious turning aside from the point at issue , and Ralph showed that he felt the same by saying no more , and leaving the room as soon as he had written a short note .
Parsing [sent. 2330 len. 36]: It was painful to be obliged to appear ungracious , but painful things have to be done occasionally , and Hope longed for the day to arrive that would put an end to her suffering .
Parsing [sent. 2331 len. 56]: Avice pleaded hard for an extension of her stay , and could only be pacified by the promise of a longer visit in spring , when the lodge rooms were to be furnished and the new scheme inaugurated by which she was to play the part of fairy godmother to less fortunate girls than herself .
Parsing [sent. 2332 len. 43]: That was one good thing that seemed likely to arise from this visit , and it was some compensation to Hope to receive her cousin 's affectionate embrace at parting , and to hear her say , `` Goodbye , sweet Hope .
Parsing [sent. 2333 len. 9]: Do n't forget me among all your duties .
Parsing [sent. 2334 len. 29]: We shall be in town again in a fortnight , and I sha 'n' t be content unless you come at least once a week to see me .
Parsing [sent. 2335 len. 8]: You have done me lots of good .
Parsing [sent. 2336 len. 17]: I 'll try -- I really will try -- to think more of other people . ''
Parsing [sent. 2337 len. 19]: That sent Hope away with a thankful heart , and with courage to go through the farewells downstairs .
Parsing [sent. 2338 len. 23]: Her new friends seemed sorry to say good-bye , but it was not a sorrow that would imperil their peace of mind .
Parsing [sent. 2339 len. 28]: Truda had received a longed-for invitation to a country-house in the neighbourhood , and was in the highest of spirits , and Mr Merrilies was not present .
Parsing [sent. 2340 len. 51]: Hope wondered if she were not to see him to say good-bye , but when she stepped out of the carriage on to the platform of the little station , a tall figure appeared within the threshold of the waiting-room , and Ralph Merrilies himself stepped forward to meet her .
Parsing [sent. 2341 len. 14]: `` I thought I would walk home this way and see you off .
Parsing [sent. 2342 len. 4]: Are you alone !
Parsing [sent. 2343 len. 15]: Will you come in here beside the fire or walk up and down ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2344 len. 37]: Hope glanced at the clock , found she had still five minutes to wait , and decided that it would be less embarrassing to move about than to remain within the confines of that little room .
Parsing [sent. 2345 len. 29]: `` I shall have to sit still for the next three hours , so I think I will walk about , please , if you do n't mind .
Parsing [sent. 2346 len. 15]: I hope you will have good sport this afternoon , and to-morrow at Benckley .
Parsing [sent. 2347 len. 14]: Did Miss Bennett tell you she had received her invitation for next week ?
Parsing [sent. 2348 len. 22]: She is quite excited about it , for so many of Aunt Emma 's guests seem to be going on there .
Parsing [sent. 2349 len. 12]: You are one of the number , are n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2350 len. 24]: `` I think not I left it indefinite , and I rather fancy I shall write to say that I must go home .
Parsing [sent. 2351 len. 11]: I thought of leaving The Shanty to-morrow or Saturday . ''
Parsing [sent. 2352 len. 26]: He was silent for a moment , his eyes on the ground ; then he said suddenly , `` You will give me your address ?
Parsing [sent. 2353 len. 23]: I must have it for my sister , who will want to write to you about the date of her party . ''
Parsing [sent. 2354 len. 6]: `` Yes , of course .
Parsing [sent. 2355 len. 7]: Thank you so much for remembering .
Parsing [sent. 2356 len. 21]: I have not a card in my purse , but our number is ten -- Number 10 Whately Mansions . ''
Parsing [sent. 2357 len. 16]: `` And may I -- will you allow me to come to see you sometimes ?
Parsing [sent. 2358 len. 16]: I am often in town , and it would give me so much pleasure ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2359 len. 24]: He did not look at her as he spoke , and Hope was thankful that he did not see her flush of dismay .
Parsing [sent. 2360 len. 25]: She had never anticipated such a request , and was terrified by a suggestion that would make all her good resolutions of no effect .
Parsing [sent. 2361 len. 33]: During every hour of the last three days she had congratulated herself that her time of probation was short , and that with her return home would come back peace and contentment .
Parsing [sent. 2362 len. 35]: What prospect of recovery could there be , what chance of work well done , if the expectation of Ralph 's coming was ever before her as the one great possibility of the day ?
Parsing [sent. 2363 len. 6]: And what would Truda say ?
Parsing [sent. 2364 len. 18]: The thought that she might perhaps be endangering Truda 's happiness nerved her to boldness of speech .
Parsing [sent. 2365 len. 20]: `` You are very kind , but we are business women , and our sitting-rooms are our work-rooms also .
Parsing [sent. 2366 len. 14]: I fear we must deny ourselves the pleasure of visitors yet awhile . ''
Parsing [sent. 2367 len. 19]: She cost a hurried glance at the clock to see how many of the five minutes still remained .
Parsing [sent. 2368 len. 3]: Only one !
Parsing [sent. 2369 len. 37]: The porter was carrying her box to the farther end of the station , a group of rustics were strolling out of the ticket-office , and Mr Merrilies was saying quietly : `` Art is long .
Parsing [sent. 2370 len. 15]: You find , as do all her disciples , that she demands undivided allegiance .
Parsing [sent. 2371 len. 12]: I shall look forward to hearing the result of your labours .
Parsing [sent. 2372 len. 5]: Here is your train .
Parsing [sent. 2373 len. 15]: You would like the small bag in the carriage , would n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2374 len. 37]: There was a note in his voice which gave Hope actual pain to hear , and the remembrance of his set white face was not a pleasant one for her to carry away on her journey .
Parsing [sent. 2375 len. 3]: CHAPTER FOURTEEN .
Parsing [sent. 2376 len. 3]: HOME AGAIN .
Parsing [sent. 2377 len. 13]: The little flat looked bright and cheery when the traveller reached home .
Parsing [sent. 2378 len. 43]: A new lampshade had replaced the one which Mary had burned , sixpence-worth of flowers were displayed to the utmost advantage against a background of dried fern , and the three sisters were beaming with joy at the return of their peacemaker .
Parsing [sent. 2379 len. 51]: They asked questions steadily for an hour on end , and even then were far from being satisfied ; for , though Hope smiled and declared that she had had `` a lovely time , '' they were vaguely conscious of the difference which she herself felt only too surely .
Parsing [sent. 2380 len. 45]: Hitherto home had meant the centre of interest , and its walls had practically bounded the world ; now her heart was a wanderer , and at every pause in the conversation roved away to that distant spot where it had found fresh anchorage .
Parsing [sent. 2381 len. 27]: Fortunately for the keeping of her secret , the girls were enthusiastic on the subject of the children 's entertainment , and encouragingly sanguine of success .
Parsing [sent. 2382 len. 59]: Theo had finished writing the story , and read it aloud after dinner to an appreciative audience , who unanimously decided that she must give her attention to children 's stories forthwith , since nothing more poetically graceful , and at the same time interesting and exciting , could be wished to while away the children 's hour .
Parsing [sent. 2383 len. 43]: Hope was humming over the refrain of a chorus , and trying to decide which of two well-known airs would be more suitable , when Madge drew a sheet of paper from a portfolio and held it towards her with conscious pride .
Parsing [sent. 2384 len. 12]: `` My share in the Amalgamated Sisters ' Enterprise , Limited !
Parsing [sent. 2385 len. 29]: I never like to be out of a good thing , so , though I was not asked , I determined to have a finger in the pie .
Parsing [sent. 2386 len. 20]: You will want some sort of advertisement to take round to entertainment agencies , and to distribute among friends .
Parsing [sent. 2387 len. 5]: There you are ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2388 len. 22]: There Hope was indeed , for Madge was never more happy than when she could give full play to her fancy .
Parsing [sent. 2389 len. 42]: For years past she had amused herself by designing artistic programmes for the small bazaars and concerts that had taken place at her country home , so that she had experience as well as interest to help her on this occasion .
Parsing [sent. 2390 len. 30]: Hope grew quite pink with pleasure and embarrassment as she looked down the sheet and tried to realise that she herself was the performer of whom it spoke . ''
Parsing [sent. 2391 len. 8]: _ Tell me a story _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2392 len. 37]: ran the heading , in quaint , uneven lettering ; while immediately underneath came a sketch of two children , a boy and a girl , with hands outstretched as though they were offering the petition .
Parsing [sent. 2393 len. 34]: Madge had copied the figures from an old sketch , altering only the dress to suit the occasion ; and a dainty little pair they made , most eloquent in their dumb entreaty .
Parsing [sent. 2394 len. 42]: Beneath came more lettering , setting forth that Miss Hope Charrington , the children 's entertainer , was prepared to give her charming recitals at Christmas parties , bazaars , or charity gatherings for the sum of two guineas an hour .
Parsing [sent. 2395 len. 36]: A waving , ribbon-like border edged the sheet , held up at the corners by four characters dear to the childish heart -- the Prince , the Princess , the Fairy , and the Giant .
Parsing [sent. 2396 len. 6]: `` Madge , you darling !
Parsing [sent. 2397 len. 5]: How perfectly lo-ovely ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2398 len. 6]: gasped Hope , in delight .
Parsing [sent. 2399 len. 13]: `` So clever , so dainty , so -- so beautifully professional !
Parsing [sent. 2400 len. 8]: But oh , _ dare _ I ?
Parsing [sent. 2401 len. 5]: ` Charming recital ' !
Parsing [sent. 2402 len. 7]: Suppose it is a terrible failure .
Parsing [sent. 2403 len. 6]: ` Children 's entertainer ' !
Parsing [sent. 2404 len. 10]: I have never entertained any one in my life .
Parsing [sent. 2405 len. 8]: Suppose I were to break down . ''
Parsing [sent. 2406 len. 5]: `` Practice makes perfect .
Parsing [sent. 2407 len. 11]: Of course , you will have to try your hand .
Parsing [sent. 2408 len. 21]: The vicar of Saint Giles 's called on us yesterday , and asked if we would help in the parish .
Parsing [sent. 2409 len. 26]: I asked -- just as a feeler -- if he would like a treat for the school children , and he snatched at the idea .
Parsing [sent. 2410 len. 26]: You are to let him know what you can do ; and if you run the blockade of his street-arabs you need fear no longer .
Parsing [sent. 2411 len. 19]: _ They _ wo n't pretend to be amused if they are not , that is certain . ''
Parsing [sent. 2412 len. 14]: `` It will be pleasant for me if they hoot in the middle !
Parsing [sent. 2413 len. 15]: But I 'll put my feelings in my pocket and do my very best .
Parsing [sent. 2414 len. 46]: I must do _ something _ with my life , and I am determined that nervousness sha 'n' t stand in my way ; '' and Hope sighed once more -- the short , stabbing little sigh that had come so often since her return .
Parsing [sent. 2415 len. 49]: When the sisters retired to bed that evening Theo chatted pleasantly about ordinary matters until the gas was put out ; then she stretched out an arm , and asked in a tenderer tone than was often heard from her lips : `` What is it , deary !
Parsing [sent. 2416 len. 5]: What is the trouble ?
Parsing [sent. 2417 len. 6]: Can you tell me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2418 len. 10]: `` Oh Theo , how did you know ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2419 len. 5]: cried poor Hope guiltily .
Parsing [sent. 2420 len. 11]: `` I thought I had hidden it so well . ''
Parsing [sent. 2421 len. 44]: And then out it came -- the poor little love-story , that was hardly a love-story at all , but only a `` might have been ; '' the happiness of those few days , the awakening , the bitter wrench of parting .
Parsing [sent. 2422 len. 30]: The soft voice trembled as it came to the end of the story , and a little sob was swallowed with the last words : `` He was hurt !
Parsing [sent. 2423 len. 7]: I could see he was hurt .
Parsing [sent. 2424 len. 18]: There was a sort of strained look on his face as he stood looking after the train .
Parsing [sent. 2425 len. 10]: Oh Theo , do you think I did right ?
Parsing [sent. 2426 len. 10]: Do you think I have made a mistake ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2427 len. 10]: Theo 's arm pressed tenderly against the heaving shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 2428 len. 43]: `` I think , '' she said quietly -- `` I think you did what seemed to you best at the time , and what was very hard to do ; and that , having done it , you must not regret .
Parsing [sent. 2429 len. 17]: When you have chosen the narrow way , dear , you must not look back . ''
Parsing [sent. 2430 len. 20]: `` No , '' said Hope faintly ; `` but still -- I ca n't -- help -- regretting .
Parsing [sent. 2431 len. 18]: It is cowardly , Theo , but he was so -- I liked him so very much .
Parsing [sent. 2432 len. 17]: Do you think it is all over -- that I shall never see him again ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2433 len. 16]: `` He can see you at his sister 's next month if he wishes to .
Parsing [sent. 2434 len. 11]: Try to put him out of your mind until then .
Parsing [sent. 2435 len. 15]: Work hard , and let off steam to me when you feel particularly blue .
Parsing [sent. 2436 len. 17]: This new plan is going to be a success ; I feel convinced of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2437 len. 30]: Theo was too prudent to give more definite comfort , but when by herself she laughed scornfully at the idea that a solitary refusal could discourage a true lover .
Parsing [sent. 2438 len. 40]: If this Mr Merrilies had been simply attracted by a pretty face , and was likely to forget the fancy as quickly as it was formed , why , then , the less Hope thought of him the better .
Parsing [sent. 2439 len. 14]: But the artless narrative had given Theo a different impression of his feelings .
Parsing [sent. 2440 len. 66]: Dear , modest Hope had no idea of her own winsome charm , but her sister felt it impossible that a man of taste could live in the same house , learn the unselfish sweetness of her disposition , share in her light-hearted gaiety , and watch the different emotions flit over her face as she sang , and still call his heart his own .
Parsing [sent. 2441 len. 26]: `` If he is a thousand times all she thinks him , he is not good enough for Hope , '' she told herself proudly .
Parsing [sent. 2442 len. 25]: `` But oh , what a comfort it would be if she married happily , and had no need to fight for her bread !
Parsing [sent. 2443 len. 16]: She is too sensitive to bear the ` heart-breaking ' that is my apprenticeship . ''
Parsing [sent. 2444 len. 15]: The slow tears rose in Theo 's eyes and trickled on to the pillow .
Parsing [sent. 2445 len. 13]: The `` worrying story '' had been returned for the third time .
Parsing [sent. 2446 len. 8]: It was looking quite dog-eared and shabby !
Parsing [sent. 2447 len. 3]: CHAPTER FIFTEEN .
Parsing [sent. 2448 len. 4]: ENTER THE HERMIT .
Parsing [sent. 2449 len. 27]: The next morning Hope and Theo seated themselves at the piano , and tried over the songs which were to be included in the musical recital .
Parsing [sent. 2450 len. 39]: The words had been written to fit certain tunes , but on singing them over little hitches and awkwardnesses were discovered , which made it necessary to reconstruct certain lines or introduce a new word for an old .
Parsing [sent. 2451 len. 43]: As Philippa sat darning stockings in the dining-room , she smiled to herself at the sound of the disconnected snatches of song and the monotonous repetition of airs which were in such strange contrast to the classical music in which Hope delighted .
Parsing [sent. 2452 len. 75]: All the same , the refrains were very catching ; and when the `` Giant 's Song '' was practised in its turn , Philippa found herself instinctively swelling the chorus , and emphasising the last words of the lines in merry , schoolgirl fashion : `` Whether he be alive , or whether he be _ dead _ , I 'll have his _ bones _ to make my _ bread _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2453 len. 56]: At lunch-time author and composer made their appearance , rather blue as to complexion and red as to fingertips -- for the luxury of a fire in the drawing-room could not be indulged in before three o'clock at the earliest -- but jubilantly pleased with themselves , and with the improvements which they had accomplished .
Parsing [sent. 2454 len. 38]: The next thing on the programme was to have a number of circulars lithographed for distribution , and for these Hope proposed to arrange that very afternoon , Madge accompanying her , the better to give instructions .
Parsing [sent. 2455 len. 17]: `` I can pay for them out of uncle 's present , '' she explained smilingly .
Parsing [sent. 2456 len. 25]: `` He drove down to the lodge with me , and slipped a note in my bag in his usual fussy , disconnected fashion .
Parsing [sent. 2457 len. 16]: ` Something to pay your fare , my dear -- just to pay your fare !
Parsing [sent. 2458 len. 7]: Serious thing to live upon capital !
Parsing [sent. 2459 len. 14]: Must n't allow you to be out of pocket by visiting us . '
Parsing [sent. 2460 len. 38]: I thought it would be a couple of sovereigns just to cover expenses , and forgot to open the envelope until just now when I was getting ready for lunch and wanted something out of the bag .
Parsing [sent. 2461 len. 14]: Then I came across it , and what do you think I found ?
Parsing [sent. 2462 len. 4]: A ten-pound note !
Parsing [sent. 2463 len. 10]: Was n't it sweet of the little mannikin ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2464 len. 4]: `` Very decent .
Parsing [sent. 2465 len. 6]: Fancy your forgetting about it !
Parsing [sent. 2466 len. 33]: I should have torn it open the moment his back was turned , '' cried Madge in amazement , while Hope sighed at the remembrance of how her thoughts had been occupied .
Parsing [sent. 2467 len. 21]: It was a relief to be up and doing , and she started on the important expedition directly after lunch .
Parsing [sent. 2468 len. 46]: Theo turned out also in search of adventure , while the busy housekeeper toiled away at her basket of mending , building castles in the air about that happy time when her fledglings would be full-grown geniuses , and poverty and anxiety known no more .
Parsing [sent. 2469 len. 27]: Three o'clock struck , and almost at the same moment came the sound of the electric bell to startle Philippa in the midst of her dreams .
Parsing [sent. 2470 len. 28]: In response to the summons the little maid went to the door , and a man 's voice was heard inquiring if Miss Charrington was at home .
Parsing [sent. 2471 len. 23]: Philippa gasped in dismay , and offered up a mental prayer that Mary would remember to show the visitor into the drawing-room .
Parsing [sent. 2472 len. 12]: But Mary had no intention of doing anything of the kind .
Parsing [sent. 2473 len. 34]: Of experience she had none , but her sense of fitness told her that when a gentleman wished to see the missus he should be shown into her presence as speedily as possible .
Parsing [sent. 2474 len. 44]: She opened the door of the dining-room for about the space of six inches , peered round the corner , announced , `` Here 's a gentleman , '' and promptly retired to her lair , leaving the stranger standing on the mat .
Parsing [sent. 2475 len. 38]: Philippa groaned in spirit over her own negligence , vowed that not another day should elapse before Mary was instructed in the art of introducing visitors , and walked forward to discover the identity of the stranger .
Parsing [sent. 2476 len. 2]: Alas !
Parsing [sent. 2477 len. 33]: the first glance brought a prevision of trouble ; she saw before her the stooping form , the thin , cadaverous face of the `` Hermit , '' occupant of Number 9 .
Parsing [sent. 2478 len. 26]: He bowed , she bowed , invited him into the room by a wave of the hand , and stood before him in questioning silence .
Parsing [sent. 2479 len. 47]: Seen close at hand , the Hermit was younger and less austere than he had appeared from a distance ; his features , though emaciated , were delicately moulded , and the eyes that looked out of the hollow caverns were bright and alert with life .
Parsing [sent. 2480 len. 59]: It was the face of a man whose body was the slave of his brain -- a man who forgot his meals in the interest of work ; who turned day into night , and persistently ignored physical ills -- a striking contrast to the girl beside him , with her glowing cheeks and tall , well-developed figure .
Parsing [sent. 2481 len. 8]: `` You wished to see me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2482 len. 8]: asked Philippa , to end the silence .
Parsing [sent. 2483 len. 20]: The Hermit coughed nervously , and turning his hat to and fro , nicked the dust from the brim .
Parsing [sent. 2484 len. 7]: `` I -- er -- yes .
Parsing [sent. 2485 len. 12]: I came to the conclusion that a personal interview was necessary .
Parsing [sent. 2486 len. 21]: I have tried -- er -- other means of protest , but , as you are aware , without success .
Parsing [sent. 2487 len. 43]: The case in point is -- er -- briefly this , that I can not any longer submit to the annoyance which I have suffered since you have taken possession of this flat , and by which my work is seriously interrupted .
Parsing [sent. 2488 len. 26]: The ordinary noise of a household I must of course , endure , but that is a different thing from wilful , intentional disturbance . ''
Parsing [sent. 2489 len. 3]: `` Wilful !
Parsing [sent. 2490 len. 3]: Intentional ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2491 len. 18]: Philippa 's cheeks grew rosy red , and she squared her shoulders in her old determined fashion .
Parsing [sent. 2492 len. 35]: All the danger-signals were flying , and if any members of the family had been present they would have given little indeed for the chances of the stranger in the battle which loomed ahead .
Parsing [sent. 2493 len. 32]: `` I think you can hardly mean to insult me by insinuating that we have deliberately tried to annoy a neighbour , however wanting in courtesy we may have found him .
Parsing [sent. 2494 len. 39]: I presume the immediate reason of this complaint was the music this morning ; but I may remind you that for the last ten days the piano has not been opened , as my sister was from home .
Parsing [sent. 2495 len. 22]: Does it not strike you as somewhat unreasonable to complain if a neighbour plays the piano once in a fortnight ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2496 len. 26]: `` I was not aware that the interval had been so long ; but even so , there ought to be moderation in all things .
Parsing [sent. 2497 len. 54]: People who live in these establishments ought to remember that , however gratifying to their own tastes it may be to sing comic songs for hours at a stretch '' -- the thin lips curved into a barely concealed sneer -- `` it may be a most painful penance for their neighbours . ''
Parsing [sent. 2498 len. 14]: `` Even so , I am afraid it was necessary in this case .
Parsing [sent. 2499 len. 20]: My sisters were not practising for their own amusement ; strange to say , they also were at work .
Parsing [sent. 2500 len. 31]: It is not necessary to go into details , but I can assure you that what they were doing was as important to them as your studies are to yourself .
Parsing [sent. 2501 len. 15]: You misjudged them altogether if you supposed they wore performing for your edification . ''
Parsing [sent. 2502 len. 25]: `` I am sorry if I have made a mistake ; though , of course , this was only one occasion out of many .
Parsing [sent. 2503 len. 99]: As a matter of fact I did not intend to speak of music primarily , but of the other noises , which are more difficult to explain : a constant tapping outside my study window , for instance , which has a most trying effect on the nerves , and has made connected thought impossible every evening during the last week ; and an extraordinary jarring sound which wakes me out of sleep before it is light , so that not only is my day 's work marred , but my nights are disturbed into the bargain . ''
Parsing [sent. 2504 len. 15]: Philippa rested her hands on the table and stared at him with distended eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2505 len. 5]: Was the man mad ?
Parsing [sent. 2506 len. 37]: Was he one of those morbid creatures who develop hallucinations in their lonely hours , and who , having once become possessed of an idea , proceed to nurse and coddle it into a full-grown mania ?
Parsing [sent. 2507 len. 15]: She tried to keep calm and cool , but her voice vibrated with indignation .
Parsing [sent. 2508 len. 19]: `` And do you seriously mean to tell me that you believe _ us _ to be responsible !
Parsing [sent. 2509 len. 28]: Do you blame _ us _ because something has gone wrong with your window-frame , or because the noises in the street disturb you in the morning ?
Parsing [sent. 2510 len. 5]: They disturb me too .
Parsing [sent. 2511 len. 21]: I can rarely sleep after five o'clock , but I have certainly never dreamt of blaming you for the fact .
Parsing [sent. 2512 len. 28]: You can not possibly mean that you think -- '' `` I do more than think : I am as sure as it is possible to be .
Parsing [sent. 2513 len. 19]: It is no ordinary street noise which wakens me , but something much nearer , and more jarring .
Parsing [sent. 2514 len. 31]: It appears to be immediately outside my window , and it happens once each morning -- and only once -- sometimes at five , sometimes later , sometimes earlier still .
Parsing [sent. 2515 len. 27]: With regard to the tapping , it has never happened before ; and so far as I am aware , nothing is wrong with my window .
Parsing [sent. 2516 len. 22]: I believe , as I said before , that both these noises are the result of intention , not accident . ''
Parsing [sent. 2517 len. 12]: Philippa looked at him steadily with her bright , dark eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2518 len. 36]: `` And suppose , '' she said quietly -- `` suppose I tell you in return that you are entirely mistaken , and that we have nothing to do with either one or the other .
Parsing [sent. 2519 len. 3]: What then ?
Parsing [sent. 2520 len. 8]: Will you refuse to believe me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2521 len. 17]: The two stared at one another in silence , like combatants measuring strength for a fight .
Parsing [sent. 2522 len. 21]: It was the man whose eyes were the first to fall , the man who first showed signs of relenting .
Parsing [sent. 2523 len. 22]: `` Of course , if you give me your word , Miss Charrington , I am bound to take it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2524 len. 26]: `` Then I give you my word , Mr Neil , that we are absolutely innocent of annoying you in the way you describe . ''
Parsing [sent. 2525 len. 18]: The Hermit bowed , laid his hat on the table , and fumbled nervously with his coat .
Parsing [sent. 2526 len. 14]: `` I can only say that the matter is most mysterious and annoying .
Parsing [sent. 2527 len. 40]: Perhaps , however , you will be willing to promise that in other respects you will be more considerate for the future , so that I may be able to work with less disturbance from the noise overhead ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2528 len. 35]: `` I am afraid I can not see my way to giving any such promise , for I fail to see how we _ can _ be quieter without interfering with our own duties .
Parsing [sent. 2529 len. 21]: I have three sisters , and music is the profession by which one of them hopes to make a living .
Parsing [sent. 2530 len. 12]: If she gave up practising it would seriously injure her prospects .
Parsing [sent. 2531 len. 18]: The others are busy all day long , and naturally wish for a little relaxation at night .
Parsing [sent. 2532 len. 50]: Although you give us no credit for consideration , I may tell you that we are constantly calling our young brother to order in case he should disturb you , but I should not feel it right to make home dull and cheerless by forbidding any noise whatever . ''
Parsing [sent. 2533 len. 33]: `` It does not occur to you that under those circumstances you are hardly the right tenants for a flat , but ought to be in a house of your own ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2534 len. 56]: `` It occurs to me that we are the best judges of our own actions , '' returned Philippa icily , fighting down the wild longing that arose , even as she spoke , for a place of their own -- a nest , however small , where they might dwell in peace and freedom .
Parsing [sent. 2535 len. 35]: `` You are not the only tenant , Mr Neil , who has to endure disagreeables from his neighbours ; we also might find ground for complaint , if we wished to be disagreeable .
Parsing [sent. 2536 len. 28]: My sisters sleep above your study , and they say you keep poking the fire until two in the morning and waking them up with a start .
Parsing [sent. 2537 len. 44]: Then , too , you have a hanging lamp or chandelier which you push up , and which makes a most unpleasant noise ; and in the autumn evenings you smoked strong cigars on your balcony until we were poisoned with the smell .
Parsing [sent. 2538 len. 42]: Oh , there are a thousand things which I could mention , '' cried Philippa -- though in truth she would have been puzzled to add one more complaint to her list -- `` but I would not stoop to it !
Parsing [sent. 2539 len. 13]: It is too miserably petty and degrading to be everlastingly picking quarrels .
Parsing [sent. 2540 len. 7]: I am sick of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2541 len. 8]: `` Not more heartily than I am .
Parsing [sent. 2542 len. 34]: I have lived in these buildings for nearly ten years and have only once before made a complaint -- which , I may remark , was met in a very different spirit . ''
Parsing [sent. 2543 len. 23]: The Hermit was evidently growing ruffled in his turn , and could not resist a parting shot before he left the room .
Parsing [sent. 2544 len. 37]: `` As I said before , I should be sorry to have to complain at headquarters , but I do not intend to have my comfort ruined by new-comers who have no claim on the establishment .
Parsing [sent. 2545 len. 25]: If it becomes impossible for us both to live under one roof , I have little doubt who would be asked to remain . ''
Parsing [sent. 2546 len. 4]: He was gone .
Parsing [sent. 2547 len. 19]: The door closed behind him , and Philippa sank into a chair with a sudden feeling of collapse .
Parsing [sent. 2548 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 2549 len. 3]: oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2550 len. 20]: she cried , and her hands went up to her head , and her breath grew short and strangled .
Parsing [sent. 2551 len. 30]: All her pride and independence were swept aside by the remembrance of those last pregnant words : `` Impossible for us both -- little doubt in whose favour ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2552 len. 23]: Suppose -- oh , suppose , the Hermit complained to the committee , and she were served with a notice to quit !
Parsing [sent. 2553 len. 19]: Suppose , with one set of bills barely settled , she were called upon to incur a second !
Parsing [sent. 2554 len. 24]: With characteristic Charrington impetuosity she beheld ruin stalk towards her , and the faces of brothers and sisters filled with a pale reproach .
Parsing [sent. 2555 len. 16]: Her head dropped forward on to the table ; the tears rolled down her cheeks .
Parsing [sent. 2556 len. 53]: She was just about to indulge in the luxury of a good cry , when suddenly there was a sound in the room , an exclamation of distress , and there stood the Hermit , picking up the hat which still lay on the table , and murmuring disconnected sentences of explanation .
Parsing [sent. 2557 len. 6]: `` I forgot my hat .
Parsing [sent. 2558 len. 12]: The door was still open ; I forgot to shut it .
Parsing [sent. 2559 len. 8]: I turned back -- _ Crying _ !
Parsing [sent. 2560 len. 25]: I hope that I -- that nothing that I have said -- I should be most distressed -- '' Philippa stared at him helplessly .
Parsing [sent. 2561 len. 23]: Her impulse was to deny the suggestion with scorn , but how was that possible with the tears rolling down her cheeks ?
Parsing [sent. 2562 len. 25]: She tried to control herself , to steady her voice sufficiently to reply , but the floodgates were open and could not be restrained .
Parsing [sent. 2563 len. 39]: An agony of dread seized her lest she should humiliate herself still further , and , pointing to the door with childlike helplessness , she sobbed out a pitiful `` Please , go -- please , go ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2564 len. 8]: and buried her face in her hands .
Parsing [sent. 2565 len. 14]: The Hermit crept back to his room , but he could not work .
Parsing [sent. 2566 len. 18]: Between himself and his books rose the vision of a girl 's face , tremulous and tearful .
Parsing [sent. 2567 len. 10]: The dark eyes looked into his with pathetic reproach .
Parsing [sent. 2568 len. 15]: He called himself a brute and a coward for having dared to distress her .
Parsing [sent. 2569 len. 3]: CHAPTER SIXTEEN .
Parsing [sent. 2570 len. 4]: THE CULPRIT DISCOVERED .
Parsing [sent. 2571 len. 39]: Acting on the rule of all good housewives , Philippa breathed no word of the unpleasant incident of the afternoon until dinner was over , and the workers had been fed and rested after their day 's labours .
Parsing [sent. 2572 len. 40]: Stephen , it is true , noted the pucker on her brow , and questioned her dumbly across the table ; but she frowned a warning , and eagerly questioned the girls as to the success of their expedition .
Parsing [sent. 2573 len. 48]: The circulars , it appeared , were promised in a week 's time ; and pending their arrival Hope had called on the vicar on the way home , and arranged to give her first performance to the members of his infant class on the following Monday .
Parsing [sent. 2574 len. 50]: She had confided to him her anxiety to rehearse her entertainment , and he had laughingly promised to find her occupation for as many nights as she liked to give , either in his own parish or in those neighbouring ones which were even more in need of help .
Parsing [sent. 2575 len. 25]: `` So you will gain experience and do good at the same time -- a most agreeable arrangement , '' said Philippa , smiling .
Parsing [sent. 2576 len. 35]: `` The next thing is to buy yourself a really smart frock with the remainder of Uncle Loftus 's cheque , so that you may be ready for the social engagements when they come .
Parsing [sent. 2577 len. 28]: You have nothing suitable , and in this case it is a duty to be provided with the prettiest and most becoming gown you can find . ''
Parsing [sent. 2578 len. 11]: `` That 's the sort of duty I should like .
Parsing [sent. 2579 len. 21]: I could be a martyr to it if I had the chance , '' cried Madge , with a sigh .
Parsing [sent. 2580 len. 16]: `` No mortal being knows how it harrows my artistic soul to wear ugly clothes .
Parsing [sent. 2581 len. 20]: I sometimes feel inclined to kneel down and , do obeisance before the dresses in the Bond Street shops .
Parsing [sent. 2582 len. 8]: And they look so lovely just now !
Parsing [sent. 2583 len. 34]: I 've had a horrible temptation sometimes to ask for things to be sent on approval , just for the pleasure of trying them on and seeing how I look in them . ''
Parsing [sent. 2584 len. 23]: `` Do you think it is an honourable thing to send for things that you have no earthly intention of buying ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2585 len. 16]: asked Philippa the literal , with a solemn air , which delighted her mischievous sister .
Parsing [sent. 2586 len. 15]: `` No , I do n't ; I think it 's a mean trick .
Parsing [sent. 2587 len. 6]: But I 'm so dull !
Parsing [sent. 2588 len. 10]: I want to do something reckless for a change .
Parsing [sent. 2589 len. 47]: You need n't alarm yourself , Philippa ; if I wrote asking for a selection of Court dresses to be sent on approval to an address off the Tottenham Court Road , they would n't pay much attention to the order , I 'm afraid . ''
Parsing [sent. 2590 len. 30]: Theo thought not , indeed ; while Hope looked pained and penitent , and said , `` I seem to have all the changes -- all the good things .
Parsing [sent. 2591 len. 10]: I suppose I ought to dress for the part .
Parsing [sent. 2592 len. 8]: But remember the ` Amalgamated Sisters ' !
Parsing [sent. 2593 len. 11]: Whatever I gain must be divided in equal shares . ''
Parsing [sent. 2594 len. 24]: `` If you want excitement , it is a pity you were n't at home this afternoon , Madge , '' said Philippa .
Parsing [sent. 2595 len. 21]: Dinner was over by this time , and she felt free to unburden her mind and receive the longed-for sympathy .
Parsing [sent. 2596 len. 18]: `` I had an adventure all to myself , and found it more exciting than I liked .
Parsing [sent. 2597 len. 26]: The Hermit called , and Mary announced him in her own original fashion -- that is to say , left him standing on the mat .
Parsing [sent. 2598 len. 15]: He came to lodge some more complaints , and we had a row royal .
Parsing [sent. 2599 len. 14]: I think he is mad , for he made the most extraordinary statements .
Parsing [sent. 2600 len. 24]: But he is worse than mad ; he is dangerous , and means to complain and get us turned out if he can .
Parsing [sent. 2601 len. 36]: There is not the slightest ground for his complaints , but he is an old tenant and we are new , and it is only natural that his word should be taken before ours . ''
Parsing [sent. 2602 len. 15]: `` Do n't worry yourself about that old girl , '' said Stephen kindly .
Parsing [sent. 2603 len. 44]: `` I have not the slightest fear of being turned out Neighbours in flats are constantly having these little frictions , and the authorities must turn a deaf ear to complaints if they wish to succeed or to have any peace in life .
Parsing [sent. 2604 len. 23]: I 'll go down some night and talk to the old fellow , and see if I can bring him to reason .
Parsing [sent. 2605 len. 13]: We have been so quiet , too , since Hope went away .
Parsing [sent. 2606 len. 11]: What on earth did he find to grumble about ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2607 len. 10]: `` Oh , my dear , the wildest fancies !
Parsing [sent. 2608 len. 54]: He did n't like Hope practising the children 's songs this morning , and was blightingly superior about her taste ; but the worst grievance is that there is a tapping at his study window which gets on his nerves , and that something wakes him up every morning before it is light .
Parsing [sent. 2609 len. 18]: It sounds too ridiculous to be true , but he actually supposed that we were responsible . ''
Parsing [sent. 2610 len. 6]: `` What utter folly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2611 len. 39]: began Stephen angrily ; but the next moment he stopped short , and with one accord four pairs of eyes followed his towards the corner of the room where Barney sat -- shaking , red-faced , apoplectic . ''
Parsing [sent. 2612 len. 5]: _ Barney _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2613 len. 11]: cried the head of the house in a terrible voice .
Parsing [sent. 2614 len. 8]: `` What is the meaning of this ?
Parsing [sent. 2615 len. 13]: Do you mean to say that this is _ your _ doing ?
Parsing [sent. 2616 len. 9]: Have you had any hand in this business ?
Parsing [sent. 2617 len. 6]: Speak up this moment . ''
Parsing [sent. 2618 len. 8]: `` I should think I had ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2619 len. 3]: cried Barney .
Parsing [sent. 2620 len. 6]: `` Both hands in it !
Parsing [sent. 2621 len. 21]: Did n't I vow when Hope went away that I would find some plan of keeping the old fellow occupied ?
Parsing [sent. 2622 len. 23]: I flatter myself that I hit on something original this time , and secured a fine effect with next to no trouble .
Parsing [sent. 2623 len. 23]: The tapping was made by a little lead weight hung on the end of a string fastened outside the girls ' window .
Parsing [sent. 2624 len. 28]: It swung about in the air , just at the top of his panes , and when there was a breeze , tapped away like a machine .
Parsing [sent. 2625 len. 15]: I fastened it up one day , and left it to do its work .
Parsing [sent. 2626 len. 11]: It 's there still , if you choose to look .
Parsing [sent. 2627 len. 7]: The waking-up business was more difficult .
Parsing [sent. 2628 len. 30]: I found out , by watching the lights at night , that he slept beneath my room , and I borrowed an alarum from a fellow in the office .
Parsing [sent. 2629 len. 15]: I told him why I wanted it , and he nearly died with laughing .
Parsing [sent. 2630 len. 22]: I set it for different hours , and lowered it down by a cord so that it lay against the pane .
Parsing [sent. 2631 len. 32]: I left my window open , and when it went off it woke me too , and I hopped out of bed and pulled it up before he opened his window .
Parsing [sent. 2632 len. 23]: It was too dark for him to see anything , but I could hear him muttering to himself in a tearing rage .
Parsing [sent. 2633 len. 35]: It came off splendidly , but I 'm not sorry to give up that part of the business , for it was jolly cold getting out of bed and standing by that open window .
Parsing [sent. 2634 len. 27]: It is n't good enough in this weather ; '' and Barney doubled himself up in another burst of laughter at the success of his plot .
Parsing [sent. 2635 len. 23]: For once nobody joined in the chorus ; the girls were dumb and horrified , while Stephen was filled with righteous indignation .
Parsing [sent. 2636 len. 13]: `` Stop laughing this moment , sir , '' he cried sternly .
Parsing [sent. 2637 len. 17]: `` You have done mischief enough ; do n't make it worse by triumphing over it .
Parsing [sent. 2638 len. 28]: If you have not enough consideration for your sisters to teach you how to behave , I must find some other way of keeping you in order .
Parsing [sent. 2639 len. 17]: I wo n't have the peace of the house ruined and Philippa worried to death . ''
Parsing [sent. 2640 len. 15]: `` Leave him to me , please , Steve , '' said Philippa quietly .
Parsing [sent. 2641 len. 25]: She walked forward until she stood immediately before Barney , and the smile faded from the boy 's lips as he saw her face .
Parsing [sent. 2642 len. 38]: She was not flushed as he had often seen her under the stress of passing irritation , but white -- deadly white -- with a look in her eyes before which his own fell to the ground .
Parsing [sent. 2643 len. 14]: `` You have made me tell a lie , '' she said slowly .
Parsing [sent. 2644 len. 5]: `` Do you hear ?
Parsing [sent. 2645 len. 16]: I gave Mr Neil my word that we had had no part in these annoyances .
Parsing [sent. 2646 len. 19]: He did not want to believe me , but I made him ; I gave him my word .
Parsing [sent. 2647 len. 19]: I will not wait a minute before going to him and apologising for saying what was not true .
Parsing [sent. 2648 len. 3]: Get up !
Parsing [sent. 2649 len. 5]: Come downstairs with me .
Parsing [sent. 2650 len. 23]: You shall tell him the whole story as you have told it to us , and ask his pardon like a gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 2651 len. 5]: Are you coming ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2652 len. 36]: Barney scowled and looked at her darkly ; he opened his lips to say that he would do nothing of the kind , but Philippa looked at him again , and the words died away .
Parsing [sent. 2653 len. 22]: She walked to the door , and he marched after her ; she held it open , and he passed through .
Parsing [sent. 2654 len. 18]: They stood together before the Hermit 's door , and Philippa pressed her fingers on the bell .
Parsing [sent. 2655 len. 3]: CHAPTER SEVENTEEN .
Parsing [sent. 2656 len. 2]: REHEARSALS .
Parsing [sent. 2657 len. 48]: Half-an-hour passed by , fraught with the deepest suspense and anxiety to the waiting party in Number 10 ; then Philippa 's step was heard running up the stairs , and in she came , white no longer , but smiling , rosy , abeam with complacency .
Parsing [sent. 2658 len. 6]: `` Where is Barney ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2659 len. 41]: cried four voices eagerly ; and she seated herself before the fire , crossed her hands on her lap , and regarded her audience with the prospective satisfaction of one who knows that she is about to make a sensation .
Parsing [sent. 2660 len. 21]: `` Barney , '' she said slowly , `` is enjoying himself so much that he refused to come away !
Parsing [sent. 2661 len. 9]: He is invited to stay for the evening .
Parsing [sent. 2662 len. 17]: He is at present employed in helping Mr Neil to catalogue specimens for his microscope . ''
Parsing [sent. 2663 len. 4]: `` Wh-at ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2664 len. 21]: gasped Stephen incredulously , while Theo caught hold of her sister by the shoulders and gave her an impatient shake .
Parsing [sent. 2665 len. 6]: `` Phil , be sensible !
Parsing [sent. 2666 len. 4]: Tell it properly .
Parsing [sent. 2667 len. 19]: Begin at the moment when you knocked at the door , and go right through to the end .
Parsing [sent. 2668 len. 6]: Now then , begin ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2669 len. 32]: `` We-ll , '' drawled Philippa comfortably , `` I rang , and a boy came to the door -- I do n't think there is a woman on the premises .
Parsing [sent. 2670 len. 15]: Mr Neil heard our voices , and came out to see what was wanted .
Parsing [sent. 2671 len. 26]: He took us into his room , which is all books and litter , and a great big microscope on a stand by the window .
Parsing [sent. 2672 len. 14]: Do n't ask me what I said , for I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 2673 len. 11]: I only remember his face looking so startled and sorry .
Parsing [sent. 2674 len. 19]: He is really very nice-looking , you know ; and he wears a velvet coat Barney behaved well .
Parsing [sent. 2675 len. 16]: He said , ` I 'm sorry , sir , if I have annoyed you .
Parsing [sent. 2676 len. 7]: It was only a joke . '
Parsing [sent. 2677 len. 16]: And Mr Neil said , ` All right , my boy , that is settled .
Parsing [sent. 2678 len. 9]: We wo n't say anything more about it .
Parsing [sent. 2679 len. 7]: Are you interested in microscopes ! '
Parsing [sent. 2680 len. 23]: After that we went over to the stand , and he explained what he was doing , and showed us the workings .
Parsing [sent. 2681 len. 5]: It was very exciting .
Parsing [sent. 2682 len. 18]: Barney was in raptures , and I was quite horrified to find how long we had stayed .
Parsing [sent. 2683 len. 21]: He was as nice and kind as he could be , and I believe it is the beginning of peace .
Parsing [sent. 2684 len. 8]: Oh , my dears , such dust !
Parsing [sent. 2685 len. 8]: I longed for a brush and shovel .
Parsing [sent. 2686 len. 22]: No wonder he looks ill , living alone in that dreary place , with only a boy to attend to him .
Parsing [sent. 2687 len. 7]: I believe he is starved . ''
Parsing [sent. 2688 len. 18]: `` He is a real good sort , anyway , to behave so well to that boy .
Parsing [sent. 2689 len. 21]: I 'll call on him some night , and perhaps we can return his kindness by asking him here occasionally .
Parsing [sent. 2690 len. 17]: I am glad peace is settled , but I am not done with Mr Barney yet .
Parsing [sent. 2691 len. 16]: He must promise me to give up these foolish tricks , '' said Stephen severely .
Parsing [sent. 2692 len. 20]: He himself had never played a trick in his life , and could not imagine wherein the fun lay .
Parsing [sent. 2693 len. 36]: When Barney came upstairs an hour later he was taken into the dining-room and lectured in solemn , elder-brotherly fashion ; and being in the highest of spirits , obediently promised all that was desired .
Parsing [sent. 2694 len. 26]: `` I sha 'n' t want to rag him any more , because , you see , we shall be pals , '' he explained .
Parsing [sent. 2695 len. 38]: `` He wants me to go down whenever I feel inclined , and that will be pretty often ; because , though the girls are bricks , a man does like another man to talk to sometimes .
Parsing [sent. 2696 len. 5]: He 's terrifically clever !
Parsing [sent. 2697 len. 20]: You should see all the things he has made himself -- little mechanical businesses that you ca n't buy .
Parsing [sent. 2698 len. 14]: He is going to let me watch him when he is at work .
Parsing [sent. 2699 len. 25]: I fancy he felt a bit bad when Phil ate humble-pie , and wants to make up by being extra amiable and friendly . ''
Parsing [sent. 2700 len. 36]: It was just as well that the Hermit had been conciliated , for in the days which followed Hope was constantly practising her songs and reciting her story to an imaginary audience in the drawing-room .
Parsing [sent. 2701 len. 23]: Mary , sweeping the tiny hall , would open her eyes in amazement as a voice cried dramatically : `` Fairy Godmother !
Parsing [sent. 2702 len. 3]: Fairy Godmother !
Parsing [sent. 2703 len. 7]: can you not help me now ?
Parsing [sent. 2704 len. 11]: I 'm so lonely up here in this deserted tower .
Parsing [sent. 2705 len. 11]: Is the spell not broken yet , dear Godmother ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2706 len. 11]: And the fairy answered : `` Patience , Princess Chrystal !
Parsing [sent. 2707 len. 7]: Wait but a few hours longer .
Parsing [sent. 2708 len. 61]: To-morrow morn , as the sun creeps round the corner of the poplar tree , look out of your casement window , and you will see '' -- Mary was all agape to know what the Princess Chrystal would see , but Philippa came bustling out of the dining-room and , half-laughing , half-frowning , sent her about her work .
Parsing [sent. 2709 len. 33]: Later on a message-boy who was waiting for an answer to a note grew quite pale with agitation as an unseen giant hissed out , `` To your knees , rash youth !
Parsing [sent. 2710 len. 19]: Before another hour is past you shall be chained in the lowest dungeon beneath the castle moat ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2711 len. 39]: It was really quite alarming , and the message-boy informed his companions who were waiting for him in the road below that there was a lunatic upstairs , who was raging and carrying on `` somethink krool . ''
Parsing [sent. 2712 len. 45]: The first performance was a nervous occasion , and Hope realised the full difficulty of the task which she had undertaken when she stood upon the platform of the mission-room vainly trying to gain a hearing from a crowd of noisy , excited children .
Parsing [sent. 2713 len. 50]: Appeal was useless , but at length the happy idea struck her to begin with a song ; so down she sat at the piano , struck up a lively air , and gave the first verse with such spirit and go that at the word `` Chorus ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2714 len. 10]: there was quite a creditable attempt at the refrain .
Parsing [sent. 2715 len. 25]: After that it was comparatively easy to keep the attention which she had gained , although she had rarely before experienced such tiring work .
Parsing [sent. 2716 len. 54]: For a first attempt the performance was a distinct success -- ay , more than a success -- for it proved the existence of many weak spots , demanded more prominence for dramatic incidents , and proved that , given time and experience , she need not fear the most critical juvenile audience .
Parsing [sent. 2717 len. 42]: Twice more did Hope give a performance of the fairy play before the long-delayed circulars were ready , and she started forth on the difficult work of distribution , with Madge as companion , guide , and administrator of much-needed courage .
Parsing [sent. 2718 len. 36]: Any girl who has tried to earn her own living will have discovered how different becomes the demeanour of those in authority when the supposed customer turns out to be herself in need of help .
Parsing [sent. 2719 len. 34]: It is a painful revelation , and the moral which it teaches us is , to be gracious to other poor suppliants if it ever comes to our turn to be in authority .
Parsing [sent. 2720 len. 51]: Madge had made a list of those entertainment bureaux where tickets can be obtained for theatres and concerts , and arrangements made for drawing-room entertainments ; but when the first of these establishments was reached Hope made three successive bolts post the door before she could be induced to enter .
Parsing [sent. 2721 len. 32]: Her embarrassment was greatly increased by the fact that several other people were in the shop , ready to listen and to stare with curious eyes as she mumbled her request .
Parsing [sent. 2722 len. 48]: The assistant ran his eye carelessly over the leaflet -- Madge 's masterpiece , printed regardless of expense on thick rough paper with torn edges -- did not think there was any demand for that sort of thing ; was afraid it was not in their line .
Parsing [sent. 2723 len. 37]: No , did not object to keeping the advertisement ; would put it on the stand if there was room ; and before the girls had turned aside , had flicked it carelessly into a drawer .
Parsing [sent. 2724 len. 38]: Hope was trembling , crimson of cheek , and inclined to turn tail and make a short cut for home ; but Madge 's chin was in the air , and her face set in determined lines .
Parsing [sent. 2725 len. 4]: `` Snob ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2726 len. 19]: she cried scornfully ; `` working himself , and despising others because they try to do the same .
Parsing [sent. 2727 len. 9]: Dear Hope , do n't look so doleful .
Parsing [sent. 2728 len. 15]: You surely wo n't let yourself be discouraged by a worm like that . ''
Parsing [sent. 2729 len. 9]: `` Oh , it is so hateful ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2730 len. 5]: murmured poor Hope tremulously .
Parsing [sent. 2731 len. 13]: `` Suppose they _ all _ treat us in the same way .
Parsing [sent. 2732 len. 17]: You know very well , Madge , that that circular will never see the light . ''
Parsing [sent. 2733 len. 9]: `` Oh , wo n't it , though ?
Parsing [sent. 2734 len. 45]: It shall be up on that board before a week is over , '' returned Madge obstinately ; and when breathlessly questioned how and why , she answered imperturbably , `` Have n't the slightest idea , but I 'll find out a way .
Parsing [sent. 2735 len. 20]: Cheer up now , and for goodness ' sake do n't look as if you were ashamed of yourself .
Parsing [sent. 2736 len. 51]: I 'd send you home and go the round myself if we could exchange faces for the occasion , but if you will only perk up you can do far better than I. Look smiling and self-possessed , and as if you were rather conferring than asking a favour . ''
Parsing [sent. 2737 len. 9]: It was admirable advice , but , alas !
Parsing [sent. 2738 len. 11]: Hope was not the girl to carry it into effect .
Parsing [sent. 2739 len. 37]: Her cheeks would flush ; her voice _ would _ shake ; she looked so unmistakably the amateur that , in spite of her charming appearance , she met with but scant success wherever she went .
Parsing [sent. 2740 len. 27]: No one actually refused her circular , but the manner of its acceptance was so lukewarm and careless that it would have depressed the stoutest heart .
Parsing [sent. 2741 len. 42]: Even Madge looked downcast when home was reached , but she was smiling again by dinner-time ; and what was more , Philippa and Theo were smiling too , with a mischievous enjoyment which seemed strangely unsympathetic to the crushed adventurer .
Parsing [sent. 2742 len. 32]: For several days no explanation was forthcoming ; then came an afternoon when housekeeper and author arrayed themselves in all the splendour they possessed and sallied forth on a mysterious errand .
Parsing [sent. 2743 len. 36]: Hope wondered , questioned , and was amiably snubbed for her pains ; but at five o'clock back came two flushed , triumphant conspirators , only too eager to tell the tale of their adventures .
Parsing [sent. 2744 len. 55]: `` We have been working for you , my dear , '' cried Phil , nodding cheery encouragements at the dear , pretty sister who had grown to look so pathetically pale and wistful of late ; `` but the idea came from Madge , so you have to thank her most of all .
Parsing [sent. 2745 len. 20]: Well , we sallied forth , and went the round of the shops where you had left your circulars .
Parsing [sent. 2746 len. 16]: Theo took one direction , I took another , and we met at the Stores .
Parsing [sent. 2747 len. 20]: The first shop I went into was empty , and I had quite a long talk with the man .
Parsing [sent. 2748 len. 14]: I wanted to know what entertainment he could provide for a juvenile party .
Parsing [sent. 2749 len. 13]: He suggested a magic-lantern -- cinematograph -- Punch and Judy -- conjurer .
Parsing [sent. 2750 len. 14]: I looked profoundly bored , and drawled out , ` So terribly commonplace !
Parsing [sent. 2751 len. 8]: Have you nothing _ new _ ? '
Parsing [sent. 2752 len. 32]: He declared there was nothing else , and I was feeling very baffled and angry , when suddenly he remembered your circular , and began searching for it in a drawer .
Parsing [sent. 2753 len. 24]: I regarded it with judicial calm , thought the terms rather high , but on the whole was much taken with the idea .
Parsing [sent. 2754 len. 38]: The difficulty , of course , was to withdraw without settling anything definitely ; but some other people came in , and I murmured polite nothings about ` thinking it over , ' and beat a retreat .
Parsing [sent. 2755 len. 26]: At the next place my pumping failed , for the wretch had forgotten all about you , or had thrown your circular into the fire .
Parsing [sent. 2756 len. 29]: You must send him another with a polite reminder of his promise to find you engagements , ` subject , of course , to the usual commission . '
Parsing [sent. 2757 len. 20]: Number three had actually pinned you up on the board , beside the Performing Brothers and the Negro Troupe .
Parsing [sent. 2758 len. 15]: He ought to have been an author , for he had a beautiful imagination !
Parsing [sent. 2759 len. 15]: When I inquired about you he waxed quite enthusiastic about your abilities and popularity .
Parsing [sent. 2760 len. 22]: I regarded him more in joy than in anger , and hoped he embroidered as eloquently to all his customers . ''
Parsing [sent. 2761 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 2762 len. 3]: oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2763 len. 5]: cried Hope , aghast .
Parsing [sent. 2764 len. 12]: She was torn in twain between elation and pangs of conscience .
Parsing [sent. 2765 len. 8]: `` How sweet of you , Phil !
Parsing [sent. 2766 len. 11]: But -- do you think it is quite right ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2767 len. 4]: `` Why not ?
Parsing [sent. 2768 len. 25]: Does not every unknown author implore his friends to ask for his books at their libraries and express untold surprise because they are unknown ?
Parsing [sent. 2769 len. 11]: Why should not we advertise you in your turn ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2770 len. 19]: `` You must be boomed , my dear , or you may wait for ever for an engagement .
Parsing [sent. 2771 len. 44]: I was even more bold than Phil , '' confessed Theo , `` for I purposely hung about until other people went into the shop , and then spoke in such a loud voice that they were obliged to hear what I said .
Parsing [sent. 2772 len. 19]: They seemed quite interested , and I left one lady reading the circular and asking questions about you .
Parsing [sent. 2773 len. 28]: In another shop I said in an anxious voice , ` I _ hope _ she will be able to come to me when I want her .
Parsing [sent. 2774 len. 15]: Will it be necessary to engage her a _ long _ time ahead ? '
Parsing [sent. 2775 len. 22]: The man looked as solemn as an owl , and said , ` Well , madam , it would be wise .
Parsing [sent. 2776 len. 13]: There is sure to be a rush in the Christmas holidays . '
Parsing [sent. 2777 len. 7]: What do you think of that ?
Parsing [sent. 2778 len. 12]: Wo n't it be exciting when the letters come in ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2779 len. 50]: There was no doubt about that , but unfortunately no letters arrived ; and the weeks passed by , and the Christmas holidays began , and not a mother in the whole Metropolis expressed the slightest desire to engage the services of the `` children 's charming entertainer . ''
Parsing [sent. 2780 len. 59]: Hope 's wistful look each time that the postman 's knock came to the door moved her sisters to fresh efforts on her behalf , and an ingeniously worded inquiry was despatched for publication in the pages of a popular fashion magazine : `` Can any lady recommend a new form of entertainment for a children 's party ?
Parsing [sent. 2781 len. 8]: No lanterns , conjurers , or marionettes .
Parsing [sent. 2782 len. 6]: Early answer much appreciated . ''
Parsing [sent. 2783 len. 45]: An early answer was , in fact , in readiness from the hour when the inquiry was posted , wherein Theo was prepared to certify that , having heard Miss Hope Charrington 's entertainment -LRB- at the mission-room of Saint Paul 's Church ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 2784 len. 15]: , she was able most enthusiastically to recommend it to all mothers and guardians .
Parsing [sent. 2785 len. 2]: Alas !
Parsing [sent. 2786 len. 38]: the all-important inquiry was one of many more `` unavoidably delayed through want of space , '' and how to reply to an advertisement which had never appeared was a problem which baffled even Madge 's ingenuity .
Parsing [sent. 2787 len. 34]: `` I shall go to see Minnie Caldecott this afternoon , '' announced Hope one Tuesday morning when the post had produced nothing more inspiring than a couple of circulars and a coal-bill .
Parsing [sent. 2788 len. 21]: `` I ca n't sit here any longer doing nothing , and it is evidently no use writing to her .
Parsing [sent. 2789 len. 10]: I have not even heard if the song arrived .
Parsing [sent. 2790 len. 16]: Would any one like to come with me and get a peep into professional life ?
Parsing [sent. 2791 len. 4]: -- Theo ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2792 len. 9]: `` Yes , '' said the author quickly .
Parsing [sent. 2793 len. 14]: `` It will be ` copy , ' and I want it badly .
Parsing [sent. 2794 len. 29]: I have quite a stock of heroes and heroines on hand -- fascinating creatures , every one -- but I ca n't think what to do with them !
Parsing [sent. 2795 len. 8]: Perhaps one might be a public singer .
Parsing [sent. 2796 len. 9]: I 've given her a lovely voice already .
Parsing [sent. 2797 len. 19]: I 'll come , Hope , and make a study of the lady while you discuss business . ''
Parsing [sent. 2798 len. 50]: A few hours later , therefore , behold the two sisters seated in the warm , flower-scented little room , where the portraits of becurled ladies still smirked from the walls , and the presiding goddess dispensed tea , and kept up a stream of cheerful , inconsequent babble .
Parsing [sent. 2799 len. 33]: She appeared overjoyed to see her visitors , kissed them effusively , addressed Hope affectionately as `` Miss What 's - your-name , '' and declared that she remembered her quite well .
Parsing [sent. 2800 len. 23]: `` You brought me a song with ridiculous words ; and you have all come up to town to make your fortunes .
Parsing [sent. 2801 len. 9]: It is n't too easy , is it ?
Parsing [sent. 2802 len. 34]: I 'm supposed to be one of the lucky ones , but it is the solemn truth , my dears , that there are only a few pounds between myself and the workhouse .
Parsing [sent. 2803 len. 26]: It is a hand-to-mouth business , and what with cabs and gloves , there is precious little to be made out of these suburban engagements .
Parsing [sent. 2804 len. 11]: I shall have to get married one of these days .
Parsing [sent. 2805 len. 21]: There is one man now -- that is his portrait on the mantelpiece -- the one with the big nose !
Parsing [sent. 2806 len. 32]: He has been worrying me for years , and I tell him the first time I get a really bad cold on my chest I 'll marry him then and there .
Parsing [sent. 2807 len. 10]: I could never stand the expense of an illness .
Parsing [sent. 2808 len. 6]: Look at that girl laughing !
Parsing [sent. 2809 len. 11]: It is your sister , is n't it , dear ?
Parsing [sent. 2810 len. 5]: What is her name !
Parsing [sent. 2811 len. 2]: Theo !
Parsing [sent. 2812 len. 6]: I say , how toney !
Parsing [sent. 2813 len. 7]: Are you clever too , Theo ?
Parsing [sent. 2814 len. 6]: What is your line ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2815 len. 6]: `` I -- write ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2816 len. 21]: replied Theo , shrinking in anticipation of the question which is fraught with so much humiliation to the would-be author .
Parsing [sent. 2817 len. 56]: Of course , Miss Caldecott would instantly want to know what she had written and where it could be found , and then how agonising to be obliged to explain that ; with the exception of a few stories in a village paper , not a word of her writing had yet appeared in print !
Parsing [sent. 2818 len. 26]: Hope came to the rescue with a reply which was at once tactful and diplomatic , since it turned the conversation into the desired channel .
Parsing [sent. 2819 len. 9]: `` I have been keeping her busy lately .
Parsing [sent. 2820 len. 17]: She has been writing children 's stories for an entertainment which I am hoping to give .
Parsing [sent. 2821 len. 19]: I brought one of the advertisements to show you , as I thought you might be interested . ''
Parsing [sent. 2822 len. 46]: The undisguised yawn with which Miss Caldecott greeted this announcement was the reverse of encouraging ; but she read the circular with increasing interest , pronounced the idea to be `` rattling good , '' and wanted to know who was responsible for the design .
Parsing [sent. 2823 len. 48]: `` I 'll have a programme got up like that some day , '' she declared ; but she yawned again when the girls expatiated on the skill of their artist-sister , and interrupted with another question : `` Have you written any more songs lately ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2824 len. 30]: Hope looked at her gravely , and found it impossible to keep a tinge of reproach out of her voice as she replied , `` Why , of course !
Parsing [sent. 2825 len. 5]: You know I have .
Parsing [sent. 2826 len. 21]: I have been waiting for weeks to hear what you thought of the one I wrote especially for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2827 len. 4]: `` Gracious ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2828 len. 10]: ejaculated Miss Caldecott ; `` I never got it .
Parsing [sent. 2829 len. 29]: I remember now that you _ did _ write to me about it , but I get so many letters that I forget half what 's in them .
Parsing [sent. 2830 len. 8]: I 've never seen it , anyway .
Parsing [sent. 2831 len. 10]: Perhaps it is in that cupboard with the newspapers .
Parsing [sent. 2832 len. 26]: That is my bogy-hole , and if I have n't time to open things I stick them in there , and forget all about them .
Parsing [sent. 2833 len. 15]: You can look if you like , dear ; I 'm too lazy . ''
Parsing [sent. 2834 len. 55]: There was an air of dignified displeasure in the manner in which Hope crossed the room to avail herself of this permission ; but Miss Caldecott drank her tea in blissful unconsciousness , and when the MS was discovered , wrapped in an unopened covering , exclaimed cheerily : `` Think of that now !
Parsing [sent. 2835 len. 13]: It would have lain there till doomsday if you had n't looked .
Parsing [sent. 2836 len. 8]: Do you want me to hear it ?
Parsing [sent. 2837 len. 24]: Strum it over , then , my dear ; but I give you notice that I 'm full up for this season . ''
Parsing [sent. 2838 len. 9]: `` But -- but it was a commission !
Parsing [sent. 2839 len. 23]: You _ asked _ me to write it , '' cried Hope , stung into retort by the keenness of her disappointment .
Parsing [sent. 2840 len. 20]: `` Do n't you remember saying you wanted a domestic song about children , to make the mothers cry ?
Parsing [sent. 2841 len. 14]: You suggested the words yourself , and we carried out your idea . ''
Parsing [sent. 2842 len. 8]: `` I suggested it , did I ?
Parsing [sent. 2843 len. 5]: How clever of me !
Parsing [sent. 2844 len. 18]: I suppose I saw you were disappointed , dear , and wanted to let you down easily .
Parsing [sent. 2845 len. 15]: I hate being disagreeable , but I never thought you would take it seriously .
Parsing [sent. 2846 len. 2]: Here !
Parsing [sent. 2847 len. 5]: let me see it .
Parsing [sent. 2848 len. 13]: I can tell in a moment if it is any good . ''
Parsing [sent. 2849 len. 26]: She rose , and standing by the piano , glanced over the pages once or twice , then motioned to Hope to play the accompaniment .
Parsing [sent. 2850 len. 21]: The next moment the rich , melodious tones filled the room , and Theo held her breath in rapturous enjoyment .
Parsing [sent. 2851 len. 17]: What a glorious organ of a voice -- how sweet , how full , how true !
Parsing [sent. 2852 len. 7]: What a melting tenderness of expression !
Parsing [sent. 2853 len. 14]: What skill in seizing on effective phrases and bringing them delicately into prominence !
Parsing [sent. 2854 len. 25]: If her eyes had been shut , what a lovely , spirituelle vision she would have pictured as the owner of this wonderful voice !
Parsing [sent. 2855 len. 4]: But , alas !
Parsing [sent. 2856 len. 45]: there stood Minnie Caldecott , flushed , fat , and tousled , enveloped in the blue silk tea-gown , which was beginning to show decided signs of age -- as far removed from spirituality as it was possible for a human creature to be .
Parsing [sent. 2857 len. 18]: She sang the song to its last note , and nodded her head approvingly at its conclusion .
Parsing [sent. 2858 len. 10]: `` It is not at all bad , dear .
Parsing [sent. 2859 len. 6]: Quite a fetching little song !
Parsing [sent. 2860 len. 12]: I could make them howl over that , could n't I ?
Parsing [sent. 2861 len. 11]: And it is different from anything I have on hand .
Parsing [sent. 2862 len. 16]: I might find room for it sometimes , if we could agree about other things .
Parsing [sent. 2863 len. 9]: What was your idea as to terms ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2864 len. 6]: `` Oh , thank you !
Parsing [sent. 2865 len. 5]: You ore too kind .
Parsing [sent. 2866 len. 10]: I did not think of charging you at all .
Parsing [sent. 2867 len. 20]: It would be an advertisement for me if you sang it , and that would be sufficient payment . ''
Parsing [sent. 2868 len. 49]: Hope was fully convinced that she was acting in a generous manner , and Theo agreed with this conclusion , so that it came as a shock to both when Miss Caldecott burst into a peal of laughter , and cried loudly , `` Bless your innocent heart !
Parsing [sent. 2869 len. 13]: I meant , what are you going to pay _ me _ ?
Parsing [sent. 2870 len. 15]: Did n't you know that we were always paid for taking up a song ?
Parsing [sent. 2871 len. 11]: That is why we sing such rubbish half the time .
Parsing [sent. 2872 len. 15]: I 'm a business woman , and ca n't afford to work for nothing .
Parsing [sent. 2873 len. 37]: I 'd like to oblige you , dear , and it 's a useful little song in its way -- I believe I could do something with it -- but I must have my commission . ''
Parsing [sent. 2874 len. 15]: `` Then I am afraid it is no use discussing the subject any longer .
Parsing [sent. 2875 len. 13]: I can not afford to pay anything , '' said Hope quietly .
Parsing [sent. 2876 len. 34]: She had turned very white , but her manner was calm and collected , and she rolled up the song with an air of finality which showed that she meant what she said .
Parsing [sent. 2877 len. 24]: `` Perhaps another day , when we are better off -- '' `` Charmed to see you , dear , at any time .
Parsing [sent. 2878 len. 35]: But you 'll never get on in the world if you do n't pay out a bit at first ; or if you _ do _ , it will be a mighty slow process .
Parsing [sent. 2879 len. 39]: You think I 'm a wretch , no doubt , but I dare say if the truth were known I 'm as hard up as you are yourself ; and I have no rich friends to help me .
Parsing [sent. 2880 len. 13]: You _ have _ , and you ought to make them useful .
Parsing [sent. 2881 len. 15]: Now , I 'll tell you what I _ will _ do for you !
Parsing [sent. 2882 len. 35]: You mention my name when you hear of any one giving a reception , and every time you get me an engagement I 'll sing your song , and you shall play the accompaniment .
Parsing [sent. 2883 len. 26]: That would help us both , and I 'll do as much for you if I hear of any children 's parties coming off . ''
Parsing [sent. 2884 len. 37]: Hope 's thanks were very sweetly expressed , but disappointment was still the predominating feeling , and when the sisters found themselves in the street they exchanged a rueful glance under the light of a lamp .
Parsing [sent. 2885 len. 15]: `` It seems as if no one wanted us , '' sighed Hope sadly .
Parsing [sent. 2886 len. 20]: `` Whatever we try to do , there are a thousand people who do it a thousand times better .
Parsing [sent. 2887 len. 11]: I wonder if we shall _ ever _ succeed . ''
Parsing [sent. 2888 len. 16]: `` As Mr Hammond said , it depends upon how much heart-breaking we can stand .
Parsing [sent. 2889 len. 18]: We never shall if we lose heart before six months are over , '' said Theo sturdily .
Parsing [sent. 2890 len. 26]: `` Cheer up , old girl ; those letters will be arriving soon , and then you will be too busy to be depressed . ''
Parsing [sent. 2891 len. 6]: Hope sighed and was silent .
Parsing [sent. 2892 len. 25]: The ache at her heart made disappointment harder to bear , and Miss Caldecott 's offer of help seemed at present of little value .
Parsing [sent. 2893 len. 53]: Aunt Loftus might , indeed , be willing to engage the services of a professional , but there was no one else of whom such a favour could be asked , and the reflection brought an added sense of friendlessness to the tired girl as she walked home through the crowded streets .
Parsing [sent. 2894 len. 10]: It is always the darkest hour before the dawn .
Parsing [sent. 2895 len. 50]: So says the proverb , and in this instance it was fully justified , for no sooner had the girls passed the Hermit 's door than Philippa and Mudge flew to meet them , each waving a letter in her hand and keeping up a loud , excited chatter .
Parsing [sent. 2896 len. 6]: `` For you , Hope !
Parsing [sent. 2897 len. 3]: At last !
Parsing [sent. 2898 len. 5]: Here they come ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2899 len. 6]: `` A coat of arms .
Parsing [sent. 2900 len. 4]: Such lovely paper !
Parsing [sent. 2901 len. 4]: Beautiful writing . ''
Parsing [sent. 2902 len. 9]: `` Mine is from one of the agencies .
Parsing [sent. 2903 len. 8]: Application from a client , no doubt .
Parsing [sent. 2904 len. 6]: Be quick -- be quick !
Parsing [sent. 2905 len. 8]: We are dying to read them . ''
Parsing [sent. 2906 len. 10]: `` Why did n't you open them , then ?
Parsing [sent. 2907 len. 10]: It is your business as well as mine . ''
Parsing [sent. 2908 len. 58]: Hope opened the agency letter first , and shuddered dramatically at the intelligence that a certain Mrs Annesley would be glad to engage her services for the evening of December the 27th ; then came the turn of the second letter , and her sisters saw the pale cheeks deepen into rose as she read its contents .
Parsing [sent. 2909 len. 24]: `` It is from a Mrs Welsby , in Belgrave Square , a sister of the Mr Merrilies who was at The Shanty .
Parsing [sent. 2910 len. 15]: He has told her about me , and she wants me for the 29th .
Parsing [sent. 2911 len. 16]: I -- I think I shall take a berth on an Atlantic liner and emigrate .
Parsing [sent. 2912 len. 6]: I dare n't face it .
Parsing [sent. 2913 len. 14]: I shall make an idiot of myself ; I know I shall . ''
Parsing [sent. 2914 len. 4]: `` All right .
Parsing [sent. 2915 len. 12]: If you do n't go -- _ I shall _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2916 len. 3]: cried Madge .
Parsing [sent. 2917 len. 22]: `` I can sing too -- in a fashion -- and that money would be remarkably useful to us just now .
Parsing [sent. 2918 len. 12]: Choose between yourself and me ; that is the position . ''
Parsing [sent. 2919 len. 42]: There was no sympathy forthcoming for Hope 's nervousness ; on the contrary , she was made to feel that it was her duty to overcome any such feeling , and to do her best for the sake of the family .
Parsing [sent. 2920 len. 3]: Happy girl !
Parsing [sent. 2921 len. 34]: her chance had come , while others were still waiting their turn ; it was they who were in need of pity , not one to whom a longed-for opportunity had been given .
Parsing [sent. 2922 len. 16]: Hope listened , assented , and let no further word of dread pass her lips .
Parsing [sent. 2923 len. 27]: In truth , after the first shock was over , she forgot everything but one absorbing question -- would Ralph be at Mrs Welsby 's party ?
Parsing [sent. 2924 len. 9]: Would she be able to speak to him ?
Parsing [sent. 2925 len. 22]: Would his face lighten at the sight of her , as it had done during that happy fortnight at The Shanty ?
Parsing [sent. 2926 len. 34]: At one moment she longed passionately to meet him ; at the next she almost wished him absent , since it would be doubly difficult to be natural and unconstrained beneath his scrutiny .
Parsing [sent. 2927 len. 3]: CHAPTER EIGHTEEN .
Parsing [sent. 2928 len. 4]: MEETING AND PARTING .
Parsing [sent. 2929 len. 16]: And so the weeks went by , and the eventful evening came round at last .
Parsing [sent. 2930 len. 44]: Hope attired herself in the white dress in which she looked charming enough to enrapture any audience , seated herself in a cab , and drove away through the crowded streets , a poor little trembling Columbus going forth to discover new worlds !
Parsing [sent. 2931 len. 52]: At Belgrave Square an awning was erected over the doorway , a babel of noise filled the air , and the big rooms were crowded with dainty little forms dancing about on long white legs , and groups of boys in Eton jackets standing by themselves and looking bored and superior .
Parsing [sent. 2932 len. 33]: Mrs Welsby rustled forward to meet Hope with a glance and a smile , which made the girl 's heart leap with painful remembrance , and seemed unfeignedly rejoiced at her arrival .
Parsing [sent. 2933 len. 12]: `` Oh , Miss Charrington , so charmed to see you !
Parsing [sent. 2934 len. 15]: We have been playing games for an hour , and I am quite exhausted .
Parsing [sent. 2935 len. 7]: What exacting little wretches they are !
Parsing [sent. 2936 len. 21]: I will take them into the drawing-room and get them seated ; and will you begin at once , please ?
Parsing [sent. 2937 len. 12]: I have really come to the end of my resources . ''
Parsing [sent. 2938 len. 48]: She was so smiling and friendly that Hope 's shyness disappeared on the spot , and she helped to marshal the children to their seats , and took her stand on the little platform by the piano as the last few rows of chairs were being filled .
Parsing [sent. 2939 len. 32]: A hasty glance around had discovered no sign of Mr Merrilies ; but his absence , bitter disappointment though it was , brought an increase of self-confidence for the task ahead .
Parsing [sent. 2940 len. 77]: Experience in the mission-rooms had shown that not a moment must be lost in engaging wandering attention , so no sooner had the last little white frock taken her seat than she clapped her hands to call for silence , and looking smilingly around , began her story : `` Once upon a very long time ago there lived a king and queen , who had the most beautiful little princess daughter that was ever seen .
Parsing [sent. 2941 len. 58]: Her true name was Marie Theresa Louisa Alberta Maud Victoria Patricia Josephine , but as it was a very busy country , where the people were always going to war and having discussions among themselves , no one had time to call her by so many names , except on Sundays and bank holidays and Christmas Day .
Parsing [sent. 2942 len. 27]: On ordinary working days she was called Princess Chrystal , because her eyes were so clear and sparkling and her laugh like a chime of bells .
Parsing [sent. 2943 len. 25]: She had seven fairy godmothers , and they all came to her christening , and brought her the most wonderful presents you can imagine .
Parsing [sent. 2944 len. 45]: I am going to sing you a song which tells all about the godmothers and their presents , and I want you to listen very carefully to the first verse , and to join in the chorus when I hold up my hand . ''
Parsing [sent. 2945 len. 50]: She stepped down from the platform to seat herself at the piano , and even the superior gentlemen in Eton jackets were obliged to join in with the rest when they discovered that the words were set to the well-known rollicking tune of `` Seven Little Nigger Boys . ''
Parsing [sent. 2946 len. 26]: Though the story began in the orthodox fashion , its development was decidedly original , and the numerous songs and choruses prevented attention from wandering .
Parsing [sent. 2947 len. 58]: When it came to the turn of the Giant with his `` Fe-fo-fum , '' the boys in the back rows stamped with their feet to emphasise the words , and it was the prettiest thing in the world to see Hope shaking with laughter even as she sang , and nodding encouragement with her golden head .
Parsing [sent. 2948 len. 5]: `` Pretty dear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2949 len. 17]: said the hostess to some one who stood well back in the shadow of the doorway .
Parsing [sent. 2950 len. 9]: `` How _ blase _ you men are !
Parsing [sent. 2951 len. 12]: The idea of describing her to me in that callous manner !
Parsing [sent. 2952 len. 11]: I could sit and look at her all night . ''
Parsing [sent. 2953 len. 23]: `` Very pleasant for you ; but , if I might make a suggestion , this must be tiring work for her .
Parsing [sent. 2954 len. 15]: When Princess Chrystal is safely married I 'll take her downstairs and administer refreshment .
Parsing [sent. 2955 len. 30]: As I suggested this entertainment , I am anxious to hear how it is catching on , and I have n't seen her since she left The Shanty . ''
Parsing [sent. 2956 len. 18]: Mrs Welsby looked up keenly , but the dark face beside her was as inscrutable as ever .
Parsing [sent. 2957 len. 39]: It was not like Ralph to trouble himself about a girl , still less to volunteer excuses for his actions , and she watched curiously to see the meeting between the pair at the conclusion of the story-telling .
Parsing [sent. 2958 len. 4]: `` You ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2959 len. 26]: cried Hope , in astonishment , as she made her way past the applauding children and came out into the refreshing coolness of the hall .
Parsing [sent. 2960 len. 13]: She stood still , looking at him with wide , startled eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2961 len. 6]: `` I never saw you .
Parsing [sent. 2962 len. 8]: I thought you were not here . ''
Parsing [sent. 2963 len. 24]: `` I kept out of sight on purpose , in case it might make you nervous to see some one whom you knew .
Parsing [sent. 2964 len. 18]: Now , will you come downstairs and let me get you some refreshment after your arduous labours !
Parsing [sent. 2965 len. 9]: I am sure you must need it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2966 len. 7]: Hope looked round with uncertain glance .
Parsing [sent. 2967 len. 14]: `` I -- I think I do , but will it be right ?
Parsing [sent. 2968 len. 9]: Do you think I _ ought _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2969 len. 3]: `` Right !
Parsing [sent. 2970 len. 2]: Ought !
Parsing [sent. 2971 len. 8]: Miss Charrington , what do you mean ?
Parsing [sent. 2972 len. 17]: Take my arm now , at any rate , and explain when you are comfortably seated .
Parsing [sent. 2973 len. 13]: A matter of conscience can not be discussed in this deafening noise .
Parsing [sent. 2974 len. 20]: There is a grandfather 's chair in the corner of the dining-room , which I can confidently recommend . ''
Parsing [sent. 2975 len. 34]: It was like a revival of old times to be waited upon with such care and consideration , and being ordered not to speak a word until she had been fed and rested .
Parsing [sent. 2976 len. 13]: Hope sipped her wine and ate sandwiches in a dream of happiness .
Parsing [sent. 2977 len. 21]: Mr Merrilies had not forgotten her question , however , and presently she found herself called upon for an explanation .
Parsing [sent. 2978 len. 30]: `` I 'm so new to this business that I do n't quite know ` my place , ' '' she said , smiling at him in mischievous fashion .
Parsing [sent. 2979 len. 10]: `` Last Tuesday I had my first social engagement .
Parsing [sent. 2980 len. 26]: I arrived at the hour appointed , and found that the children were dancing , and that a conjurer was engaged as well as myself .
Parsing [sent. 2981 len. 32]: We waited our turn together , the conjurer and I , in a dreary little room , with a dreary little gas fire that sent all its warmth up the chimney .
Parsing [sent. 2982 len. 18]: We waited nearly an hour and no one came near us , and it was very cold .
Parsing [sent. 2983 len. 25]: We talked and talked , and he showed me tricks to keep up my spirits , for he saw how nervous I was . ''
Parsing [sent. 2984 len. 11]: Reggie Blake would have said , `` Happy conjurer ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2985 len. 9]: but Ralph Merrilies was not given to compliments .
Parsing [sent. 2986 len. 17]: He knitted his brows and inquired brusquely : `` What sort of a fellow was he ?
Parsing [sent. 2987 len. 5]: A decent sort ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2988 len. 9]: `` At first I thought he was detestable .
Parsing [sent. 2989 len. 21]: He was not , to put it mildly , _ quite _ a gentleman , and he was very familiar .
Parsing [sent. 2990 len. 59]: I was stiff and haughty for a few minutes , and then I began to reflect that , after all , we were in the same position , trying to earn our living , and that if I snubbed him I should be as great a snob as the woman who had cared so little for our comfort .
Parsing [sent. 2991 len. 17]: I was quite nice after that , and he really was a dear little vulgar thing .
Parsing [sent. 2992 len. 47]: He had an invalid wife at home -- and he spoke so tenderly of her -- and two little conjurer boys who knew his tricks almost as well as he did himself , and a delicate daughter , for whom I have plans in the future .
Parsing [sent. 2993 len. 27]: We exchanged addresses , and he volunteered to find me engagements , and thought we might do a very good ` j' int business . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 2994 len. 31]: Hope laughed at the remembrance , but Ralph frowned more fiercely than before , and bending forward with his chin supported on his hands , stared fixedly at her face .
Parsing [sent. 2995 len. 19]: `` I hate to hear of your having such experiences -- of your having to work at all .
Parsing [sent. 2996 len. 8]: I wish I had never suggested it .
Parsing [sent. 2997 len. 13]: Do you mean to say you _ enjoy _ it yourself ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2998 len. 39]: `` I enjoy it very much when I am well started , and see all the dear little faces looking at me ; but I hate it beforehand , and am , oh , so frightened and nervous !
Parsing [sent. 2999 len. 7]: And I love getting the money .
Parsing [sent. 3000 len. 23]: I paid a coal-bill yesterday with my very own earnings , and I never enjoyed anything more in all my life ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3001 len. 23]: He pressed his lips together and was silent , and when he spoke again it was to start an entirely new subject .
Parsing [sent. 3002 len. 9]: `` How are you going home to-night ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3003 len. 5]: `` In a four-wheeler .
Parsing [sent. 3004 len. 12]: I shall get the man to whistle for one presently . ''
Parsing [sent. 3005 len. 4]: `` Alone ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3006 len. 4]: `` Of course .
Parsing [sent. 3007 len. 18]: I am a working woman , Mr Merrilies ; I have to take care of myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 3008 len. 13]: `` Well , there is no need to-night , at any rate .
Parsing [sent. 3009 len. 11]: I shall go with you and see you safely home .
Parsing [sent. 3010 len. 16]: If you wo n't let me come inside , I shall sit on the box .
Parsing [sent. 3011 len. 8]: It is for you to decide . ''
Parsing [sent. 3012 len. 53]: The pale , disconcerted glance which the girl turned on him in reply would have depressed a more confident lover than himself ; for the suggestion had awakened Hope to the danger of her position , and filled her tender conscience with dread lest she had already been disloyal to her vow .
Parsing [sent. 3013 len. 26]: How much she would have enjoyed the prolonged _ tete-a-tete _ can be well imagined , but there were half-a-dozen reasons which made it unadvisable .
Parsing [sent. 3014 len. 47]: Mrs Welsby would naturally prefer her brother to remain until the end of the evening ; it would be discourteous to accept his escort and still refuse an invitation to the flat ; yet such an invitation once granted might mean unlimited suffering in the future !
Parsing [sent. 3015 len. 44]: Hope was still hesitating over a reply , when a reprieve came in the shape of a summons from her hostess , who beckoned to her brother from the doorway , and cried pleadingly , `` Ralph , can you possibly go upstairs ?
Parsing [sent. 3016 len. 20]: The conjurer wants to begin , and the children are scrambling over the chairs in the most hopeless fashion .
Parsing [sent. 3017 len. 12]: Do go to the rescue , like a good fellow . ''
Parsing [sent. 3018 len. 18]: The `` good fellow 's '' expression was the reverse of amiable as he prepared to obey .
Parsing [sent. 3019 len. 34]: A low `` I 'll see you later , then ; that is settled , '' reached Hope 's ears ; then Mrs Welsby rustled forward and took possession of the vacant seat .
Parsing [sent. 3020 len. 50]: In the five minutes ' conversation which followed Mrs Welsby was all that was gracious and charming , but Hope had an uncomfortable conviction that she was not altogether pleased with the _ tete-a-tete _ which she had interrupted , and that she herself was being very closely scrutinised .
Parsing [sent. 3021 len. 7]: And then came an unexpected blow .
Parsing [sent. 3022 len. 32]: After the usual compliments , and a promise to recommend the entertainment to her friends , Mrs Welsby said blandly : `` And now we must not detain you any longer .
Parsing [sent. 3023 len. 11]: You look tired , and must be longing to rest .
Parsing [sent. 3024 len. 37]: I am going to ask you to do me a favour -- to take charge of a little girl who is crying to go home , and who will not be sent for for another hour .
Parsing [sent. 3025 len. 23]: It would not be much out of your way , and you would be in time to stop the carriage from coming .
Parsing [sent. 3026 len. 16]: I will send for your cloak , and John shall whistle for a four-wheeler . ''
Parsing [sent. 3027 len. 10]: Poor Hope -- poor , miserable , deluded Hope !
Parsing [sent. 3028 len. 51]: A minute before she had been so wise , so prudent , so satisfied that she preferred to decline Ralph 's offer ; but now that escape was made easy , a wave of bitter disappointment , of wild , incredulous rebellion , took the place of the former calm .
Parsing [sent. 3029 len. 25]: She searched desperately for an excuse , an evasion , but short of confessing the previous engagement , there was nothing to be said .
Parsing [sent. 3030 len. 52]: Theo would have been equal to the occasion ; Madge would even have enjoyed it ; but Hope found herself murmuring polite acquiescence , and five minutes later was driving away from the door , as miserable a young woman as could be found in the length and breadth of London .
Parsing [sent. 3031 len. 18]: The little girl was still crying weakly ; the big girl hugged her and cried in sympathy .
Parsing [sent. 3032 len. 16]: `` He will think I did it on purpose , '' she sobbed to herself .
Parsing [sent. 3033 len. 12]: `` He will never want to speak to me again . ''
Parsing [sent. 3034 len. 23]: Ten minutes later Ralph Merrilies asked his sister the whereabouts of Miss Charrington , for whom he had been searching in vain .
Parsing [sent. 3035 len. 25]: `` She has gone home , '' was the calm reply : `` drove off in a cab directly after you went upstairs . ''
Parsing [sent. 3036 len. 49]: The glance which accompanied the reply was keenly observant ; for , though Mrs Welsby was less worldly-minded than most women of her class , it did not coincide with her plans that her brother should fall in love with a girl who was working for her living .
Parsing [sent. 3037 len. 33]: She wondered if he would show signs of disappointment ; but Ralph had his feelings well under control , and gave no visible signs of the blow which her words had inflicted .
Parsing [sent. 3038 len. 6]: `` The second time ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3039 len. 6]: he said sternly to himself .
Parsing [sent. 3040 len. 5]: `` The second rebuff .
Parsing [sent. 3041 len. 9]: That ought to be enough for any fellow .
Parsing [sent. 3042 len. 13]: Poor little girl , her life is hard enough as it is .
Parsing [sent. 3043 len. 12]: I 'm a brute if I worry her any longer . ''
Parsing [sent. 3044 len. 3]: CHAPTER NINETEEN .
Parsing [sent. 3045 len. 3]: SHADOWS AHEAD .
Parsing [sent. 3046 len. 22]: A year after the Charringtons had taken possession of their flat , the girls sat in conclave and reviewed the situation .
Parsing [sent. 3047 len. 62]: Philippa `` submitted '' her accounts with the usual unpleasant results ; for those who had nothing to do with the management were horrified at their amount , groaned over the total sum , and wondered `` how it had gone , '' until the goaded housekeeper was fain to turn the tables and inquire into the doings of her critics .
Parsing [sent. 3048 len. 19]: That brought them quickly enough to their knees , for in truth the report was far from rose-coloured .
Parsing [sent. 3049 len. 13]: `` I have made a decided improvement , '' said Theo dryly .
Parsing [sent. 3050 len. 16]: `` My manuscripts are now refused with a written acknowledgment instead of a printed slip .
Parsing [sent. 3051 len. 13]: In two cases I have even been asked to submit further efforts .
Parsing [sent. 3052 len. 22]: I worked for nearly a month on one story for Mr Hammond , and he said it was ` crude . '
Parsing [sent. 3053 len. 23]: I wrote another in one afternoon , and he said it was ` charming , but not suitable for his magazine . '
Parsing [sent. 3054 len. 20]: I have sent it to three other editors since then , and the unanimity of opinion is most impressive .
Parsing [sent. 3055 len. 14]: I gathered together all my rejected addresses and offered them to a publisher .
Parsing [sent. 3056 len. 28]: He said that volumes of short stories had been overdone , and that -- except in a few exceptional cases -- they were not publishing any more .
Parsing [sent. 3057 len. 23]: I was determined to earn money _ somehow _ , so I turned to children 's stories and paragraphs for penny papers .
Parsing [sent. 3058 len. 18]: I get a sovereign each for the stories , and five shillings a page for the paragraphs .
Parsing [sent. 3059 len. 21]: I wrote an article on ` Advice to Young Authors , ' and it was accepted on its first journey .
Parsing [sent. 3060 len. 22]: I also perpetrated a penny novelette , with detailed descriptions of the heroine 's frocks , and an earl for hero .
Parsing [sent. 3061 len. 14]: The editor accepted it , and corrected my English according to his lights .
Parsing [sent. 3062 len. 15]: I _ cringed _ over the printed copy , and blushed to my ears .
Parsing [sent. 3063 len. 22]: Altogether I have amassed seventeen pounds -- minus , of course , my expenses and the fortune expended on stamps ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3064 len. 14]: `` I wish I had done as well , '' said Hope sadly .
Parsing [sent. 3065 len. 22]: She was as pretty as ever , but her face was thinner and the mischievous dimples came more rarely into sight .
Parsing [sent. 3066 len. 26]: `` I had eight ` social engagements ' during the Christmas holidays , for four of which I have to thank my friend the conjurer .
Parsing [sent. 3067 len. 10]: Then my market was practically closed for another year .
Parsing [sent. 3068 len. 37]: Minnie Caldecott sang my song at Aunt Loftus 's reception , and again at the Welsby 's , and the publisher printed it ` as sung by Miss Minnie Caldecott , ' just as I wished .
Parsing [sent. 3069 len. 18]: They would not pay anything down , but promised a royalty if the sales exceeded five hundred .
Parsing [sent. 3070 len. 10]: Last time I inquired they had sold forty-eight copies .
Parsing [sent. 3071 len. 3]: Oh dear !
Parsing [sent. 3072 len. 17]: I got some transposing and copying to do , which paid rather better than making matches .
Parsing [sent. 3073 len. 53]: I swallowed mountains of pride and prejudice and advertised myself as an instructor of youth -- the one thing I had always vowed I would not do -- and I have one pupil with warts on her fingers , who snores all the while she is torturing the ` Village Blacksmith . '
Parsing [sent. 3074 len. 25]: I -- I always thought I was amiable before , but I have felt -- I 've felt _ murderous _ to that child !
Parsing [sent. 3075 len. 39]: I have earned nineteen pounds , Philippa , spent five on my dress , three on my cloak , over two on cabs and gloves ; grand total for a year 's effort -- ten pounds sterling ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3076 len. 27]: `` I 've not made a cent , but I 've done my best , and saints can do no more , '' cried Madge breezily .
Parsing [sent. 3077 len. 34]: `` I designed Christmas-cards and composed sensible verses to be printed on them ; not the -- `` May all your life be bright and gay , As cloudless as a summer day !
Parsing [sent. 3078 len. 17]: `` Kind of business , but reasonable good wishes which had some chance of being fulfilled .
Parsing [sent. 3079 len. 40]: The first firm kept them for months , and could not be induced to return them until I had written four times , and the second said that it was too late in the season to consider new designs .
Parsing [sent. 3080 len. 22]: I have sent headings and initial letters to magazines , and have had heaps of compliments , but nothing more substantial .
Parsing [sent. 3081 len. 38]: I have likewise had heaps of snubs at the Slade , but I bob up again like a cork after each fresh dousing , and am more determined than ever to get on and make a name .
Parsing [sent. 3082 len. 16]: The mistake we have made is in being too proud to begin at the beginning .
Parsing [sent. 3083 len. 28]: Hope is the most humble-minded of the family ; but she expected to become well-known in one season , and to sell her song by the hundreds .
Parsing [sent. 3084 len. 19]: Theo wanted to write for the _ Casket _ , and I hoped to be exhibiting before now .
Parsing [sent. 3085 len. 14]: We must crawl down , and be content to drudge before we soar .
Parsing [sent. 3086 len. 17]: My serious studies leave much to be desired , but I can caricature with the best .
Parsing [sent. 3087 len. 35]: The other day I amused myself in the lunch hour by drawing the pupils in the life , and one of the girls ' carried off the sketch and stuck it on her easel .
Parsing [sent. 3088 len. 31]: Just then in came Pepper , as we call him -- he is so horribly stinging and bitter in his criticisms -- and walked straight up to look at it .
Parsing [sent. 3089 len. 5]: Oh , my heart !
Parsing [sent. 3090 len. 22]: He was quite silent , but I saw his shoulders shaking , and when he turned round his face was red .
Parsing [sent. 3091 len. 7]: ` Whose work is this ? '
Parsing [sent. 3092 len. 38]: he asked ; and I suppose guilt was written large on my expressive features , for he came up to me and said , ` I shall have to inflict a punishment for this , Miss Charrington .
Parsing [sent. 3093 len. 15]: I can not have my pupils ridiculed and their work interrupted in this manner .
Parsing [sent. 3094 len. 20]: The punishment is -- that you draw a caricature of me on the other side of the sheet ! '
Parsing [sent. 3095 len. 22]: `` He put the paper on my easel , and all the girls giggled and peered round to witness my collapse .
Parsing [sent. 3096 len. 15]: But I was n't going to be floored by a little thing like that .
Parsing [sent. 3097 len. 24]: He stuck his hands in his pockets and stood opposite me , and I set to work to draw him then and there .
Parsing [sent. 3098 len. 36]: He was easy to caricature , for he has a curious , sheep-dog kind of face , with two deep lines running down from the nose , humped-up shoulders , and a mop of hair .
Parsing [sent. 3099 len. 25]: It really was like him , and what I call a _ polite _ caricature , so that his feelings should n't be hurt .
Parsing [sent. 3100 len. 31]: He tried to look solemn when I gave it to him , but his lips twitched , and he walked straight out of the room and took it with him .
Parsing [sent. 3101 len. 25]: Next day , when he was abusing my drawing as usual , he said , ` You had better caricature your subjects at once .
Parsing [sent. 3102 len. 17]: You will make far more out of them in that way than in any other . '
Parsing [sent. 3103 len. 17]: That was quite a compliment coming from Pepper , and I 've taken it to heart .
Parsing [sent. 3104 len. 24]: After much cogitation I have evolved an idea which , with Theo 's co-operation , I am going to put into action forthwith .
Parsing [sent. 3105 len. 28]: I sha 'n' t tell you what it is until I see how I succeed , but I do n't mind confessing that it is hardly high-class .
Parsing [sent. 3106 len. 12]: We might call it the lowest rung of the ladder . ''
Parsing [sent. 3107 len. 6]: `` Be careful , deary .
Parsing [sent. 3108 len. 12]: Do n't do anything that you would be sorry for afterwards .
Parsing [sent. 3109 len. 34]: Promise me to be careful , '' pleaded the anxious housekeeper ; and Madge promised gaily , and carried Theo away into another room to talk over the new idea without further delay .
Parsing [sent. 3110 len. 47]: Hope sat still , gazing into the fire with wistful eyes ; and Philippa , watching her anxiously , wondered , as she had often done of late , if it were only the strain of money-making which had brought such sadness into the sweet face .
Parsing [sent. 3111 len. 70]: Hope had told her nothing of Ralph Merrilies ; and indeed there was little to tell , for , with the exception of two occasions when she had met him at her uncle 's house and exchanged a few commonplace sentences , he had practically dropped out of her life since the evening when he had offered his escort and had been treated with such apparent rudeness in response .
Parsing [sent. 3112 len. 29]: Hope had given over telling herself that a fortnight 's acquaintance could not possibly influence a lifetime , for the impression was too strong to be reasoned away .
Parsing [sent. 3113 len. 32]: The picture of the strong , dark face was imprinted on her brain ; in every moment of leisure her thoughts drifted back to Ralph as the needle to the pole .
Parsing [sent. 3114 len. 18]: The longing to see him again was sometimes so strong as to be an actual physical pain .
Parsing [sent. 3115 len. 49]: Now , as she sat staring into the fire , she was reviewing her life , telling herself that love was a thing forbidden , and pondering on what remained , until , Philippa 's fixed gaze attracting her attention , she looked up with a flickering smile .
Parsing [sent. 3116 len. 7]: `` I was thinking , Phil .
Parsing [sent. 3117 len. 7]: Our talk has made me think .
Parsing [sent. 3118 len. 20]: I have worked so hard this last year , and the result is so poor -- so unsatisfactory ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3119 len. 38]: She rose , and coming close to Philippa 's side , took hold of her hand and cried , with sudden passion , `` Phil , I ca n't do it -- I ca n't go on !
Parsing [sent. 3120 len. 38]: I could _ give _ my life , I could work for nothing , gladly and cheerfully , if it were for some noble end , but I ca n't sell it for a mess of pottage !
Parsing [sent. 3121 len. 34]: I ca n't go on smiling and acting and trampling on my feelings , and associating with Minnie Caldecott and her friends for the sake of what I can make out of them .
Parsing [sent. 3122 len. 10]: And I ca n't earn enough to help you .
Parsing [sent. 3123 len. 6]: I am only a burden .
Parsing [sent. 3124 len. 17]: I want to give it up , Phil , and devote my life to doing good .
Parsing [sent. 3125 len. 18]: I want to enter a home for deaconesses , and be trained for work among the poor .
Parsing [sent. 3126 len. 43]: There is no question of money there , for you get barely enough to live in the plainest way , but I should be doing some good in the world -- '' `` Sit down , Hope , '' said Philippa quietly .
Parsing [sent. 3127 len. 20]: She waited in silence until the trembling hand lay quietly on her own , and then began her reply .
Parsing [sent. 3128 len. 15]: `` I know a girl who went to pay a visit at a country-house .
Parsing [sent. 3129 len. 40]: It was , on the face of it , merely a pleasure visit , but while there she managed to rouse a very selfish girl to the consciousness that there were other needs in the world besides her own .
Parsing [sent. 3130 len. 32]: Later on she gave real hard work to the carrying out of a scheme which she had suggested , and which has put fresh life into many tired workers this summer .
Parsing [sent. 3131 len. 23]: I know a girl who has three quick-tempered , sharp-tongued sisters , and who keeps peace among them by her sweet influence .
Parsing [sent. 3132 len. 39]: I know a girl who can make home cheerful by the exercise of her talent , and so keep a young brother happy and occupied many times when he would otherwise be roaming about in search of amusement .
Parsing [sent. 3133 len. 27]: He is only a boy , but he thinks himself a man , and he is so easily -- so easily influenced for good or bad !
Parsing [sent. 3134 len. 32]: If that girl left her home , and her sisters ' lives were made more difficult , and that poor boy went astray , would she be ` doing good ' ?
Parsing [sent. 3135 len. 13]: Would she be doing the duty that lay at her hand ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3136 len. 5]: `` Oh Phil ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3137 len. 24]: gasped Hope , dismayed ; but now Philippa in her turn was roused , and squared her shoulders in her old determined fashion .
Parsing [sent. 3138 len. 29]: `` I ca n't think what has come to girls nowadays that they must take for granted that good work must needs be without their own four walls .
Parsing [sent. 3139 len. 22]: Charity begins at home , and _ I _ call it treachery to forsake your relations when they need your help .
Parsing [sent. 3140 len. 18]: If you go away , and anything happens to Barney -- '' `` Phil , do n't !
Parsing [sent. 3141 len. 6]: I ca n't bear it .
Parsing [sent. 3142 len. 27]: Of course I will stay if you need me ; and it comforts me more than anything else to feel that I _ can _ help .
Parsing [sent. 3143 len. 17]: You are not -- not _ anxious _ about Barney , are you , dear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3144 len. 6]: `` Yes , I am .
Parsing [sent. 3145 len. 19]: I hate to put it into words , but perhaps it is better that we should consult together .
Parsing [sent. 3146 len. 42]: The boy is changed ; sometimes there is a look upon his face which I ca n't bear to see -- a worried , miserable , _ shamed _ look , as if there were something he was trying to hide .
Parsing [sent. 3147 len. 22]: He keeps asking for money , too , and at last I summoned up courage and refused to give any more .
Parsing [sent. 3148 len. 25]: I thought he would have been angry , but he only stared at me fixedly and said , ` You 'd better , Philippa !
Parsing [sent. 3149 len. 9]: You will be sorry if you refuse . '
Parsing [sent. 3150 len. 30]: Perhaps it was cowardly of me , but I was frightened and gave him what he asked ; but I spoke very plainly to him , all the same .
Parsing [sent. 3151 len. 29]: I said , ` Remember , Barney , that every unnecessary shilling you spend means extra anxiety and worry to me , and extra self-denial to the girls .
Parsing [sent. 3152 len. 10]: We expect you to help , not to hinder .
Parsing [sent. 3153 len. 18]: If you really love us you can not have the heart to be extravagant just now . '
Parsing [sent. 3154 len. 14]: He looked miserable , but he did not offer to return the money .
Parsing [sent. 3155 len. 26]: I have given him no more since then , but he must get it _ somewhere _ , for he spends far more than Steve .
Parsing [sent. 3156 len. 25]: He had half-a-dozen new ties in his drawer , and is always going to the theatre , and buying little things for his room .
Parsing [sent. 3157 len. 30]: I do n't like to speak to Steve , for the truth is , he does n't understand Barney , and does more harm than good by his interference .
Parsing [sent. 3158 len. 11]: But , Hope , you and I must work together .
Parsing [sent. 3159 len. 11]: We must save our boy before it is too late .
Parsing [sent. 3160 len. 12]: We must not allow him to get into bad ways . ''
Parsing [sent. 3161 len. 5]: `` Poor Barney ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3162 len. 4]: sighed Hope sadly .
Parsing [sent. 3163 len. 15]: `` It must be a hard life for him down in that dreary office .
Parsing [sent. 3164 len. 12]: We have wondered that he stuck to his work so well .
Parsing [sent. 3165 len. 8]: We wo n't scold him , Phil .
Parsing [sent. 3166 len. 10]: Boys wo n't stand being scolded by their sisters .
Parsing [sent. 3167 len. 52]: We will just make home as bright as we can , and make a point of consulting him and asking his help , so that he may feel like a man , poor darling -- a man who has women depending on him , and must keep straight for their sake .
Parsing [sent. 3168 len. 14]: We 'll appeal to the best in him by showing our trust . ''
Parsing [sent. 3169 len. 8]: Philippa looked at her with shining eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3170 len. 11]: `` Oh Hope , and you wanted to leave us !
Parsing [sent. 3171 len. 12]: Bless you , dear , you _ are _ a help !
Parsing [sent. 3172 len. 36]: I was feeling so cross and bitter , inclined to snap off the poor boy 's head , though my heart was breaking for him all the time ; but yours is the right way .
Parsing [sent. 3173 len. 8]: You are right and I am wrong .
Parsing [sent. 3174 len. 12]: We will begin to-night and see what we can do . ''
Parsing [sent. 3175 len. 40]: When Barney returned from town an hour or two later Hope looked at him with opened eyes , and felt a pang of remorse for the selfishness which had blinded her to the change in the boy 's face .
Parsing [sent. 3176 len. 27]: The once smooth forehead showed a faint network of lines ; his glance had lost its candour , his radiant self-confidence was replaced by nervous uncertainty .
Parsing [sent. 3177 len. 59]: He sat down quietly , casting a quick , almost furtive glance at Philippa 's face ; but when she smiled gaily in response , when she pressed dainties upon him and called him `` old boy '' in her old loving tones , his relief and pleasure found vent in one of his old bursts of merriment .
Parsing [sent. 3178 len. 29]: He laughed and sang , danced up and down the room , and chattered incessantly , and as if he had never known a care in his life .
Parsing [sent. 3179 len. 10]: `` I had a rowing from old Waxworks to-day .
Parsing [sent. 3180 len. 13]: I expect I shall get sacked soon , '' he announced complacently .
Parsing [sent. 3181 len. 11]: `` The head of our department is such a muff !
Parsing [sent. 3182 len. 20]: He ca n't see a joke , and spends half his time telling tales of me to the boss .
Parsing [sent. 3183 len. 17]: Now , Waxworks , with all his faults , has quite a decent sense of humour .
Parsing [sent. 3184 len. 15]: I tried him pretty high one day , and he really behaved uncommonly well .
Parsing [sent. 3185 len. 38]: I was at the telephone when he came out of his private room and said , ` Oh Charrington , just telephone home for me that I am bringing two of the directors to dinner to-night . '
Parsing [sent. 3186 len. 15]: I said , ` Yes , sir , ' and rang up at once .
Parsing [sent. 3187 len. 65]: Of course , I expected him to go back to his room , so after I had given the message , ` Two directors coming to dinner to-night , ' I dropped the tube and added a little warning on my own behalf for the benefit of the clerks : ` _ Do n't _ -- _ have _ -- _ hash _ ! '
Parsing [sent. 3188 len. 41]: They were all so jolly sober about it that I looked round to see what was up , and there was every man Jack of them scribbling for his life , while old Waxworks stood at his door looking on .
Parsing [sent. 3189 len. 29]: I tell you I felt pretty sick ; but he just glared at me for a moment , and then went into his room and shut the door .
Parsing [sent. 3190 len. 10]: My private opinion is that he wanted to laugh .
Parsing [sent. 3191 len. 48]: One of the fellows told me that he quite snubbed Young -- that 's our head -- when he complained of my vaulting over the desks -- waved his hand , and said , with his grandest roll , ` Your manager has been young himself ! '
Parsing [sent. 3192 len. 21]: I expect Young had it in for me worse than ever after that , and to-day he had his chance .
Parsing [sent. 3193 len. 32]: He was out of the room , and it was beastly dull , so I proposed getting up a statue gallery , and posed the fellows standing up on their stools .
Parsing [sent. 3194 len. 20]: We had the Three Graces , with their arms entwined , and their legs sticking up in the air .
Parsing [sent. 3195 len. 13]: Ulysses meeting What 's - her-name -- Penelope , was n't it ?
Parsing [sent. 3196 len. 18]: -- and hugging her round the waist , and all sorts of heathen Johnnies wrestling and fighting .
Parsing [sent. 3197 len. 38]: Then the other fellows got scared and went back to their desks , and I was doing ` Ajax defying the lightning ' in fine style , when Young came sneaking in and found me at it .
Parsing [sent. 3198 len. 21]: He told the boss , and the boss sent for me , and jawed for a quarter of an hour .
Parsing [sent. 3199 len. 14]: ` Willing to make excuses for youthful spirits , but must enforce discipline .
Parsing [sent. 3200 len. 3]: Repeated complaints .
Parsing [sent. 3201 len. 5]: Friend of your uncle .
Parsing [sent. 3202 len. 3]: Very sorry .
Parsing [sent. 3203 len. 6]: Give you another chance . '
Parsing [sent. 3204 len. 8]: You know the kind of thing . ''
Parsing [sent. 3205 len. 4]: `` Bar-ney ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3206 len. 7]: cried the four sisters in chorus .
Parsing [sent. 3207 len. 9]: But Barney only laughed and shrugged his shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 3208 len. 6]: `` What 's the odds ?
Parsing [sent. 3209 len. 10]: I 'm sick of the whole show , anyway .
Parsing [sent. 3210 len. 19]: If he thinks I am going to spend my life making out policies he is jolly well mistaken .
Parsing [sent. 3211 len. 22]: It 's bad enough as it is ; I should go cracked if I could n't have a little fun . ''
Parsing [sent. 3212 len. 19]: The lines came back to his forehead as he spoke , and Philippa regarded him in pained self-reproach .
Parsing [sent. 3213 len. 18]: This bright , adventurous spirit was never intended by nature to be chained to an office desk .
Parsing [sent. 3214 len. 14]: No wonder that he chafed at confinement , and occasionally broke the bounds .
Parsing [sent. 3215 len. 56]: If circumstances would have allowed it , he would have made a resourceful middy , a soldier who would have done good work for his country ; but circumstances had not allowed it , and here once more was the round peg in the square hole , here once more the inevitable failure and disappointment .
Parsing [sent. 3216 len. 37]: Surely there is no greater wrong that can be done to a young man , no surer way of driving him into temptation , than to set him a lifelong task which he despises and abhors .
Parsing [sent. 3217 len. 40]: Philippa determined to consult the Hermit , who was by this time a regular Sunday-night visitor at the flat , and whose understanding of the boy 's nature made him a more valuable adviser than the staid elder brother .
Parsing [sent. 3218 len. 15]: Perhaps Mr Neil might be able to suggest a way out of the difficulty .
Parsing [sent. 3219 len. 33]: For the next few days Theo and Madge took their walks abroad together , and when at home remained shut up in the drawing-room together , whence came peals of mysterious laughter .
Parsing [sent. 3220 len. 21]: Sheets of cardboard were smuggled to and fro , and finally taken out of the house and never brought back .
Parsing [sent. 3221 len. 21]: In their place , however , appeared two bright half-sovereigns , displayed with huge pride on Madge 's outstretched palm .
Parsing [sent. 3222 len. 5]: `` First fruits ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3223 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 3224 len. 8]: `` The foundations of a mighty fortune !
Parsing [sent. 3225 len. 21]: I have set up in the advertising business , my dears , and am very well satisfied with my beginning .
Parsing [sent. 3226 len. 20]: Oh , I am going to explain ; just give me time and you shall hear all about it .
Parsing [sent. 3227 len. 25]: You may remember , Phil , that you once advised me to try poster-painting , and that I was mortally offended at the suggestion .
Parsing [sent. 3228 len. 29]: I remembered it , though , and when Pepper advised me to go in for caricature , it seemed as if the two things might be worked together .
Parsing [sent. 3229 len. 54]: I was afraid it was no use trying anything big as a start , so I have been parading unfashionable thoroughfares this last week , looking out for shops which advertise their wares in the window , studying the said wares , and composing something really striking and original to attract the passers-by .
Parsing [sent. 3230 len. 32]: There was one pastry-cook 's where they had a printed cord in the window which pleased me very much -- ` Mutton pies -- as good as mother makes 'em ! '
Parsing [sent. 3231 len. 61]: The inventor of that advertisement would , I was sure , be able to appreciate my efforts ; so I drew a picture of a dinner-table , with a fat , motherly old dear cutting up pies at one end , while the different crowned heads of Europe sat round the table , elbowing each other for the first chance .
Parsing [sent. 3232 len. 14]: You should have seen the delight of the proprietor when I exhibited it .
Parsing [sent. 3233 len. 19]: He called his wife , and she came out of the little parlour , and shrieked with laughter .
Parsing [sent. 3234 len. 31]: They wanted to know what I charged for it , and I said boldly , ` Ten shillings ; and in a couple of years it will be ten pounds .
Parsing [sent. 3235 len. 17]: I am just starting in this business , so I am charging a nominal price . '
Parsing [sent. 3236 len. 31]: They whispered together , and asked if I could n't make it seven-and-six ; but I was firm , and they were glad enough to secure it at the price .
Parsing [sent. 3237 len. 5]: That was number one .
Parsing [sent. 3238 len. 17]: Number two was a failure , though I thought the sketch was the best of all .
Parsing [sent. 3239 len. 16]: The man was hard up , I think , and could n't afford the money .
Parsing [sent. 3240 len. 26]: The third was a sweet-shop , for which I illustrated a rhyme of Theo 's , with figures of the ` Shock-headed Peter ' type .
Parsing [sent. 3241 len. 19]: There was a nice old body in charge , who was not by any means an easy prey .
Parsing [sent. 3242 len. 39]: She did not believe that the picture would bring her any fresh custom , but I persuaded her to try it for a couple of days , and saw it safely pasted on the window before we left .
Parsing [sent. 3243 len. 33]: When we went back she confessed that there had been crowds of children about the window when the schools came out , and ` supposed she had better keep it now . '
Parsing [sent. 3244 len. 6]: That 's the second half-sovereign .
Parsing [sent. 3245 len. 36]: And you need n't look nervous , Phil , for I assure you I never met with greater politeness ; the assistants in the fashionable entertainment bureaux might learn a lesson from my mutton-pie gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 3246 len. 23]: Besides , it has shown me that I _ can _ do it , and I 'll be more ambitious next time .
Parsing [sent. 3247 len. 23]: I 'll show you the sketch that the tobacconist refused , to give you an idea of the style of thing . ''
Parsing [sent. 3248 len. 32]: She ran into her bedroom , and brought back a narrow sheet of paper on which was depicted a race-course , dotted over with the strangest , most comical of figures .
Parsing [sent. 3249 len. 28]: The headpieces of old Toby pipes peered forth from the necks of rotund tobacco-jars , which were crowned with cocked hats , as represented by well-filled pouches .
Parsing [sent. 3250 len. 27]: Short-stemmed pipes did service for arms , long-stemmed pipes for the wide-spread legs , and it was really astonishing how life-like and animated the figures appeared .
Parsing [sent. 3251 len. 69]: With one exception , however , the combatants were in a very sad case , tumbling , fainting , falling to the ground , standing still with bowl-like hands pressed to their hearts , while the winner pressed nearer and nearer to the goal , and on that winner 's corpulent figure was inscribed the eloquent and touching legend , `` Banks 's tobacco leads the way ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3252 len. 35]: `` The name , of course , can be altered to suit the exigencies of the situation , '' said Madge dryly ; and at that Barney burst into a roar of delighted laughter .
Parsing [sent. 3253 len. 5]: `` Good old Madge !
Parsing [sent. 3254 len. 5]: Well done , you !
Parsing [sent. 3255 len. 41]: That 's a rattling good picture , and you will sell it yet I tell you what ; there 's a little shop that I patronise sometimes on my way home , where I really think they might have it .
Parsing [sent. 3256 len. 27]: They sell newspapers and tobacco and so-called stationery , and the man is an enterprising sort of fellow , who would take up a new idea .
Parsing [sent. 3257 len. 16]: I 'll write down the address , and you might call in some day . ''
Parsing [sent. 3258 len. 5]: `` Good old Barney !
Parsing [sent. 3259 len. 5]: Good for you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3260 len. 5]: replied Madge in return .
Parsing [sent. 3261 len. 29]: It was a simple enough suggestion , frankly made and as frankly accepted ; neither brother nor sister suspected to what weighty consequences it was to give rise .
Parsing [sent. 3262 len. 3]: CHAPTER TWENTY .
Parsing [sent. 3263 len. 3]: THE DISCOVERY .
Parsing [sent. 3264 len. 31]: Over a week elapsed before Madge was able to carry out Barney 's suggestion and offer the race-course advertisement to the tobacconist who had been mentioned as a likely purchaser .
Parsing [sent. 3265 len. 40]: As a preliminary measure she thought it wise to prospect the shop itself to see if it boasted any speciality which could be introduced into the sketch , and also to study the neighbourhood in search of further customers .
Parsing [sent. 3266 len. 24]: When the first sketch had been touched up , and two more executed , she sallied forth to try her fate once more .
Parsing [sent. 3267 len. 21]: She was less fortunate this time than on her first expedition , inasmuch as she met with two decided refusals .
Parsing [sent. 3268 len. 49]: The tobacconist came last on the list , and Madge 's thin face shone with the light of battle as she stepped across his threshold ; for hers was one of the fortunate natures which holds the more firmly to its purpose when face to face with difficulty .
Parsing [sent. 3269 len. 49]: To return home without one single sheaf to flourish was not to be thought of for a moment ; by cajolery , tact , or insistence , this last chance must be turned into a success , and a bright half-sovereign transferred from the till to her purse .
Parsing [sent. 3270 len. 29]: It was already late in the afternoon , the gas was lit , and the master of the shop was sitting behind his counter reading an evening newspaper .
Parsing [sent. 3271 len. 53]: He looked up in astonishment as Madge entered , for his clientele was almost exclusively masculine , and there was something about this quiet , black-robed girl which made him rise hastily and put on his best manners , as he inquired with what he could have the pleasure of serving her .
Parsing [sent. 3272 len. 45]: She was a lady -- not a pretty lady , yet there was something very taking about the way in which she smiled and said frankly : `` Well , do you know , I want _ you _ to be my customer to-day !
Parsing [sent. 3273 len. 37]: I have heard that you are enterprising and fond of taking up new ideas , and I have drawn a picture advertisement which I thought you might like to buy to paste in your window . ''
Parsing [sent. 3274 len. 7]: The man looked dubious and disappointed .
Parsing [sent. 3275 len. 32]: `` I hardly think '' -- he began uncertainly ; but Madge was already unrolling her paper , and what living tobacconist could have withstood the picture that was then revealed !
Parsing [sent. 3276 len. 29]: This one , at least , was profoundly impressed ; but when the money question was approached he showed a shocking ignorance of the value of artistic efforts .
Parsing [sent. 3277 len. 32]: `` If you ` ad said ` arf-a-crown , now , '' he said sadly ; and then Madge thought it was time to cease cajolery and show a firm front .
Parsing [sent. 3278 len. 64]: She spoke to him seriously on the subject of an artist 's education -- of its duration , its cost , its difficulties ; she hinted at a reputation which would be seriously injured by the receipt of silver coins , and gave him to understand that the day was near at hand when the sketch might be resold at a fabulous profit .
Parsing [sent. 3279 len. 31]: The bargaining was continued for a considerable time , but Madge was sharp enough to see where she could afford to be firm , and would not concede a point .
Parsing [sent. 3280 len. 20]: In the end the tobacconist sighed and succumbed , but not without making a stipulation on his own side .
Parsing [sent. 3281 len. 33]: There were one or two trifling additions which he wished made to the advertisement , and these Madge offered to do then and there if he could accommodate her with a table .
Parsing [sent. 3282 len. 41]: There was no room in the tiny shop , but he looked towards the half-open door which led into the room behind , and whistled a summons , in response to which a thin , sad-faced woman made her appearance .
Parsing [sent. 3283 len. 15]: `` Mother , will you give this young lady a seat in the parlour ?
Parsing [sent. 3284 len. 34]: She 's got a drawing here that you will like to see , and there are one or two little things she is going to put in to make it better still . ''
Parsing [sent. 3285 len. 40]: `` Come in , miss , '' said the woman curiously ; and Madge walked into a little oven of a room , which was , however , clean and tidy , and not without a certain homely charm .
Parsing [sent. 3286 len. 40]: The pictures on the walls were almost without exception prints of racing horses , and while the tobacconist 's wife examined her sketch , Madge studied these prints with interest , and could not resist remarking on their number .
Parsing [sent. 3287 len. 10]: `` You must be very fond of horses . ''
Parsing [sent. 3288 len. 6]: `` My husband is ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3289 len. 16]: The woman spoke shortly , and in a tone which made Madge regret her thoughtlessness .
Parsing [sent. 3290 len. 15]: The thin face grew lined and troubled ; her voice sank to a whisper .
Parsing [sent. 3291 len. 6]: `` I hate 'em ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3292 len. 3]: she whispered .
Parsing [sent. 3293 len. 8]: `` I hate the sight of 'em .
Parsing [sent. 3294 len. 8]: They have been the ruin of us .
Parsing [sent. 3295 len. 10]: We used to be in quite a big way .
Parsing [sent. 3296 len. 7]: We 've come down and down .
Parsing [sent. 3297 len. 10]: I do n't know what will happen next . ''
Parsing [sent. 3298 len. 11]: Madge murmured sympathetically and bent her head over her work .
Parsing [sent. 3299 len. 29]: All unwillingly she had touched upon the family skeleton , and it was difficult to know how to offer consolation when the offender himself was within hearing distance .
Parsing [sent. 3300 len. 25]: She worked steadily at her sketch , while the woman sat down to her sewing , and for several moments the silence was unbroken .
Parsing [sent. 3301 len. 16]: Then came the tinkle of the little bell , and two customers entered the shop .
Parsing [sent. 3302 len. 31]: Madge heard a request for tobacco and a sporting paper , but she was in the middle of some fine printing and did not lift her head from her sheet .
Parsing [sent. 3303 len. 15]: The proprietor was evidently weighing out the tobacco while his customers studied the paper .
Parsing [sent. 3304 len. 22]: Suddenly one of them spoke in a reproachful voice : `` You were wrong about Friday 's race , Mr Edwards .
Parsing [sent. 3305 len. 6]: Brownie was not in it !
Parsing [sent. 3306 len. 11]: You have not been fortunate in your tips lately . ''
Parsing [sent. 3307 len. 6]: `` Jolly bad tips ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3308 len. 22]: cried another voice , at the sound of which Madge 's pencil slipped from her hand and rolled across the table .
Parsing [sent. 3309 len. 20]: She bent forward to rescue it , casting at the same time a lightning glance through the half-opened door .
Parsing [sent. 3310 len. 32]: The two customers were still standing before the counter , the younger of the two speaking in hot , excited tones : `` I wish I had never taken your advice .
Parsing [sent. 3311 len. 9]: It 's been a bad business for me .
Parsing [sent. 3312 len. 10]: I 've lost five pounds this last fortnight . ''
Parsing [sent. 3313 len. 30]: `` I wish _ I _ had got off with five pounds , sir , '' sighed the tobacconist ; and his wife echoed the sigh with hopeless resignation .
Parsing [sent. 3314 len. 29]: Then the bell jingled once more , the customers left the shop , and five minutes later Madge pushed back her chair and prepared to follow their example .
Parsing [sent. 3315 len. 13]: `` Bless me , miss , you _ are _ white ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3316 len. 5]: cried the woman anxiously .
Parsing [sent. 3317 len. 6]: `` Have you turned faint ?
Parsing [sent. 3318 len. 17]: Sit down , my dear , and I 'll make you a cup of tea . ''
Parsing [sent. 3319 len. 22]: `` Thank you , you are very kind , but I shall be all right when I get into the air .
Parsing [sent. 3320 len. 10]: The room -- the room is rather warm . ''
Parsing [sent. 3321 len. 51]: Madge gave a nickering smile , pulled herself together , and went through the concluding interview with the shopman with creditable composure ; but once outside in the street , and lost in the deadliest of all solitudes -- a London crowd -- her agitation could no longer be restrained .
Parsing [sent. 3322 len. 3]: Oh Barney !
Parsing [sent. 3323 len. 22]: beloved Benjamin of the family -- radiant , clear-eyed child -- honest , fearless boy -- have you come to this ?
Parsing [sent. 3324 len. 4]: Betting , Barney !
Parsing [sent. 3325 len. 55]: Losing five pounds in a fortnight -- throwing it away with both hands -- while at home Philippa sat sewing -- sewing from morning to night -- mending , turning , contriving , to save a penny -- while Steve became old before his time , and Hope grew pale and thin with anxiety .
Parsing [sent. 3326 len. 18]: A rush of colour flooded Madge 's cheeks , and the indignant blood tingled in her veins .
Parsing [sent. 3327 len. 12]: Then came a sudden terrifying thought before which she paled again .
Parsing [sent. 3328 len. 9]: _ Where had Barney got this money _ ?
Parsing [sent. 3329 len. 33]: It was impossible that he could have saved it out of his pittance of a salary ; the home exchequer could not furnish it ; then how had he come by it ?
Parsing [sent. 3330 len. 23]: Madge walked along the busy streets pondering on this question , and on another equally important -- her own course of action .
Parsing [sent. 3331 len. 44]: If she could save her sisters from this painful discovery , if she could bring Barney to a sense of his wrong-doing , and pay off his debts by her own work , Madge felt that she would not have lived in vain .
Parsing [sent. 3332 len. 38]: It did not matter how hard she had to work ; she would sit up half the night gladly -- gladly ; and her experience had been so encouraging as to justify her in more ambitious flights .
Parsing [sent. 3333 len. 39]: She would set to work at once on a design for a nursery frieze which had been in contemplation for some time past , offer it to a West End firm , and boldly ask a good price .
Parsing [sent. 3334 len. 13]: If only Barney would be frank , and confess the whole truth !
Parsing [sent. 3335 len. 36]: She reviewed his conduct for the last few weeks , and realised that , with the exception of one outburst of spirits , the boy had been preoccupied , silent , inclined to be irritable .
Parsing [sent. 3336 len. 26]: She studied his face throughout the evening which followed , and was startled at what it told , even as Hope had been before her .
Parsing [sent. 3337 len. 23]: It was not until the house was quiet , and Barney had retired to his room , that Madge found her opportunity .
Parsing [sent. 3338 len. 28]: Then she knocked softly at the door , was told to come in , and entered , to find Barney hastily covering up a bundle of papers .
Parsing [sent. 3339 len. 25]: The action , the glimpse at the papers which showed them so surely to be tradesmen 's bills , fired Madge with fresh indignation .
Parsing [sent. 3340 len. 16]: She looked fixedly at the boy , and he returned her gaze with surprised inquiry .
Parsing [sent. 3341 len. 3]: `` Well !
Parsing [sent. 3342 len. 6]: What do you want ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3343 len. 13]: `` I want a little conversation with you apart from the rest .
Parsing [sent. 3344 len. 39]: I was in that tobacconist 's shop this afternoon when you came in , Barney -- that is to say , I was in the room behind the shop putting a few last touches to my sketch . ''
Parsing [sent. 3345 len. 4]: `` Well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3346 len. 14]: `` The door was open , and I heard what you said . ''
Parsing [sent. 3347 len. 30]: Barney sat down on a chair , stretched out his legs , stuck his hands in his pockets , and looked at her with an air of insolent calm .
Parsing [sent. 3348 len. 28]: The worried , downcast air which he had worn on her entrance disappeared as if by magic ; his face was hard , stubborn , and defiant .
Parsing [sent. 3349 len. 10]: `` Well -- and what if you did ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3350 len. 6]: `` What if I did ?
Parsing [sent. 3351 len. 37]: You can ask me that , when by your own confession you are betting and gambling , and leading a double life -- when you are throwing away money which is needed for daily bread ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3352 len. 13]: `` I never threw away any of your money , did I ?
Parsing [sent. 3353 len. 16]: You mind your own business , Madge , and leave me to mind mine . ''
Parsing [sent. 3354 len. 16]: `` It is my business to look after you and keep you out of mischief .
Parsing [sent. 3355 len. 8]: Where did you get that five pounds ?
Parsing [sent. 3356 len. 24]: It is bad enough that you should have lost it , but did you get it honestly , in the first place ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3357 len. 10]: `` You 'd better be careful what you say .
Parsing [sent. 3358 len. 11]: You are not talking to a thief , remember ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3359 len. 9]: `` How am I to know that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3360 len. 4]: cried Madge wildly .
Parsing [sent. 3361 len. 19]: `` If a man begins to bet , one can never tell to what he may sink next .
Parsing [sent. 3362 len. 14]: And how could a boy like you have such a sum to spare ?
Parsing [sent. 3363 len. 8]: Where did you get it , Barney ?
Parsing [sent. 3364 len. 14]: Wherever you got it , it must be paid back at once . ''
Parsing [sent. 3365 len. 5]: There was no reply .
Parsing [sent. 3366 len. 13]: Barney folded his arms , and set his lips in sullen determination .
Parsing [sent. 3367 len. 25]: The question was repeated , to be ignored once more , when the tide of the girl 's indignation could no longer be restrained .
Parsing [sent. 3368 len. 3]: `` Coward !
Parsing [sent. 3369 len. 2]: Despicable !
Parsing [sent. 3370 len. 21]: To see your sisters slaving for a pittance , and to be content to be a shame and a burden !
Parsing [sent. 3371 len. 23]: If you can not work , at least you might try to be a man , and not disgrace our name . ''
Parsing [sent. 3372 len. 12]: Bitter words -- bitter words I what need to repeat them ?
Parsing [sent. 3373 len. 45]: The girl had worked herself into a frenzy of anger , and hardly realised what she was saying , and the boy eat still and listened -- the boy of seventeen , who all his life had been the spoiled darling of the household .
Parsing [sent. 3374 len. 23]: Ten minutes before the stress of accumulated troubles was upon him , and he had been wrestling with an agony of repentance .
Parsing [sent. 3375 len. 38]: A kiss from Philippa , a soft word from Hope , would have brought him to his knees in a flood of penitent tears ; but the lash of Madge 's words hardened his heart within him .
Parsing [sent. 3376 len. 36]: He made no attempt to stop the torrent of reproach , but when at last she came to a pause he rose slowly , and standing at his full height , looked down upon her .
Parsing [sent. 3377 len. 15]: `` If you have quite finished , will you kindly leave my room ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3378 len. 24]: He pointed to the door as he spoke , and there was a look on his face which Madge had never seen before .
Parsing [sent. 3379 len. 28]: Barney the boy was dead : Barney the man confronted her with haggard face , and spoke in a tone of authority which she dared not disobey .
Parsing [sent. 3380 len. 22]: She turned towards the door , murmuring disjointed words of warning : `` If you will not tell , I must .
Parsing [sent. 3381 len. 9]: Philippa -- she will have to know . ''
Parsing [sent. 3382 len. 10]: `` There is no necessity to disturb Philippa to-night .
Parsing [sent. 3383 len. 17]: In the morning , no doubt , she will hear that -- and other things ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3384 len. 44]: There was an ominous sound in those last three words which chilled Madge with a sense of trouble to come , but the door was closed against her even as they were spoken , and she crept back to bed shivering and dismayed .
Parsing [sent. 3385 len. 32]: Perhaps if she had been gentler , more conciliating -- if she had fought with the weapons of love instead of anger -- she would not have been so signally defeated .
Parsing [sent. 3386 len. 31]: Like many another quick-tempered sister , Madge 's anger ended in self-reproach , and when too late she would have given the world to withdraw her bitter , pitiless words .
Parsing [sent. 3387 len. 4]: CHAPTER TWENTY ONE .
Parsing [sent. 3388 len. 3]: DARK DAYS .
Parsing [sent. 3389 len. 29]: The next morning , when the four sisters were seated at breakfast , Steve entered and stationed himself before the fire to read a long , business-looking letter .
Parsing [sent. 3390 len. 24]: His exclamations of dismay as he read roused the girls ' attention , but Steve did not reply -- to their eager questioning .
Parsing [sent. 3391 len. 26]: With set face he handed them the letter , and one by one they read the unwelcome intelligence , and swelled the chorus of sighs .
Parsing [sent. 3392 len. 7]: Barney was dismissed from his situation !
Parsing [sent. 3393 len. 36]: The manager wrote a courteous explanatory letter to the effect that an inexcusable escapade -- the last of a long series -- made it necessary for the lad 's connection with the office to cease .
Parsing [sent. 3394 len. 50]: He regretted this conclusion , not only from the fact that his old friend Mr Loftus would have cause for disappointment , but also , he might add , for the sake of the boy himself , who had many good points and was a favourite among his companions .
Parsing [sent. 3395 len. 26]: If he might be pardoned for making a suggestion , an office desk was hardly the right position for a youth of so much spirit .
Parsing [sent. 3396 len. 12]: Given more congenial work , he would no doubt do better .
Parsing [sent. 3397 len. 17]: It was a kindly letter , and one which made its import as palatable as possible .
Parsing [sent. 3398 len. 14]: Philippa sighed , and said , `` Just what I have been thinking !
Parsing [sent. 3399 len. 17]: It was too hard on the boy to expect him to settle to that humdrum life .
Parsing [sent. 3400 len. 12]: Perhaps this is the best thing that could have happened . ''
Parsing [sent. 3401 len. 15]: But Steve was not disposed to take such a lenient view of the matter .
Parsing [sent. 3402 len. 25]: `` If Barney had told us honestly that he could not stand it , we would have done our best to find another opening .
Parsing [sent. 3403 len. 21]: But to be dismissed like this -- to be turned away at an hour 's notice -- it is disgraceful !
Parsing [sent. 3404 len. 10]: Uncle Loftus will have every right to be angry .
Parsing [sent. 3405 len. 6]: ` An inexcusable escapade ' !
Parsing [sent. 3406 len. 10]: What can that refer to , I wonder ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3407 len. 23]: Theo covered her lips with her hands , for even at that moment she could not restrain a smile at the recollection .
Parsing [sent. 3408 len. 6]: `` I think I know .
Parsing [sent. 3409 len. 8]: Barney told me the night before last .
Parsing [sent. 3410 len. 20]: One of the clerks bought an alarm and left it on his desk while he went out to lunch .
Parsing [sent. 3411 len. 24]: He had previously announced that he was going to meet his fiancee in town , and take her to a concert after dinner .
Parsing [sent. 3412 len. 13]: Barney got hold of the alarm and set it for nine o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 3413 len. 23]: He knew the poor creatures would be sitting in cheap seats , and that there would be no cloak-room for their things .
Parsing [sent. 3414 len. 28]: The man would put the clock in his hat under the seat , and at the appointed time , _ Cr-r-r-r-r _ , off it would go !
Parsing [sent. 3415 len. 9]: He would not be able to stop it .
Parsing [sent. 3416 len. 17]: I asked Barney last night what had happened , but he would not tell me much .
Parsing [sent. 3417 len. 11]: I suppose he was in low spirits about his dismissal .
Parsing [sent. 3418 len. 37]: The alarm had gone off in the midst of a classical concerto , and the people around had been so cross that the clerk had to rush out with it as fast as he could go .
Parsing [sent. 3419 len. 15]: He was very angry , and went straight to the manager to complain . ''
Parsing [sent. 3420 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 3421 len. 2]: oh !
Parsing [sent. 3422 len. 4]: how naughty ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3423 len. 3]: cried Philippa .
Parsing [sent. 3424 len. 22]: Hope was laughing softly to herself , but Phil looked at Steve 's stern face and dared not show any amusement .
Parsing [sent. 3425 len. 8]: `` Where _ is _ Barney ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3426 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 3427 len. 16]: `` Perhaps he does not like to come in until we have read our letters .
Parsing [sent. 3428 len. 9]: Call him , Theo dear , will you !
Parsing [sent. 3429 len. 7]: His breakfast will be cold . ''
Parsing [sent. 3430 len. 34]: Theo stepped across the narrow passage and tapped at the door of Barney 's room , waited a moment , opened it gently , then came running back , all scared and breathless .
Parsing [sent. 3431 len. 6]: `` He is not there !
Parsing [sent. 3432 len. 8]: The bed has not been slept in .
Parsing [sent. 3433 len. 9]: Oh Phil , what does it mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3434 len. 11]: But she knew what it meant ; they all knew .
Parsing [sent. 3435 len. 7]: There was no need for explanation .
Parsing [sent. 3436 len. 14]: Together they crushed into the little room and looked around with haggard eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3437 len. 40]: Theo had a dreary sense of having been through it all before ; and indeed it was an old , old story , even to the torn-up papers on the hearth and the letter of farewell on the dressing-table .
Parsing [sent. 3438 len. 58]: It was addressed to Philippa , and she read it aloud , with short , gasping breaths : '' ` I have lost my situation , and have got into debt , and lost money betting on races , and the best thing I can do is to take myself off and not trouble you any longer .
Parsing [sent. 3439 len. 15]: -- I ca n't stay here to be a shame and a burden . '
Parsing [sent. 3440 len. 6]: -- -LSB- Oh Barney ! -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 3441 len. 26]: -- ` If you and Steve will pay off my bills , you can look upon the money as my share in what was left .
Parsing [sent. 3442 len. 11]: I will never trouble you for any more . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 3443 len. 37]: Here came a great dash as if the writer had intended to end the letter , but at the bottom of the sheet were a few words scribbled in uncertain letters : `` Good-bye , Phil .
Parsing [sent. 3444 len. 11]: I 'll try to keep straight for your sake . ''
Parsing [sent. 3445 len. 19]: Philippa looked up ; agony was written on her face , but her first words were of thanksgiving .
Parsing [sent. 3446 len. 4]: `` Thank God !
Parsing [sent. 3447 len. 13]: He is alive and well ; he will do himself no harm .
Parsing [sent. 3448 len. 4]: My poor boy !
Parsing [sent. 3449 len. 11]: We must find him and bring him home again . ''
Parsing [sent. 3450 len. 4]: `` Betting ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3451 len. 3]: echoed Steve .
Parsing [sent. 3452 len. 3]: `` Debts !
Parsing [sent. 3453 len. 6]: I ca n't understand it .
Parsing [sent. 3454 len. 19]: We kept him supplied with pocket-money ; he had a comfortable home ; what more did he want ?
Parsing [sent. 3455 len. 33]: I do n't wonder he was ashamed to face us , but it is a cowardly thing to run away from the consequences of his wrong-doing and bring fresh anxiety upon us .
Parsing [sent. 3456 len. 10]: I would n't have believed it of Barney . ''
Parsing [sent. 3457 len. 6]: `` It is my fault !
Parsing [sent. 3458 len. 14]: Blame me ; I drove him to it , '' said Madge desperately .
Parsing [sent. 3459 len. 34]: Her sisters stared at her in amazement , while she told the history of the last afternoon and evening , omitting nothing , extenuating nothing , repeating her bitter words with unflinching honesty .
Parsing [sent. 3460 len. 34]: Only her face betrayed the inward agony of remorse , but that was eloquent enough , and when she had finished not one of her hearers had the heart to utter a reproach .
Parsing [sent. 3461 len. 28]: Philippa looked appealingly at Steve , as if asking what could be done next ; but for once the set face refused her comfort in her need .
Parsing [sent. 3462 len. 30]: Stephen could be trusted to do what was right , but his search would lack the inspiration which would come from a thorough understanding of the boy 's character .
Parsing [sent. 3463 len. 44]: `` And I 'm only a woman ; I have n't the knowledge that a man would have , '' sighed poor Phil to herself ; then she stretched out her hands and cried sharply , `` I want to see the Hermit .
Parsing [sent. 3464 len. 6]: Barney liked him so much !
Parsing [sent. 3465 len. 26]: They used to talk together ; he will know best what was in the boy 's mind , and be able to help us . ''
Parsing [sent. 3466 len. 18]: `` I 'll bring him up , '' said Steve , and turned straightway to the door .
Parsing [sent. 3467 len. 27]: He , too , was eager for a man 's advice -- a calm , masculine judgment -- to temper the discussion with these distracted girls .
Parsing [sent. 3468 len. 26]: Relief was apparent in his manner when he followed the Hermit into the dining-room five minutes later , and summoned his sisters to meet him .
Parsing [sent. 3469 len. 6]: `` Barney has gone ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3470 len. 16]: said Philippa simply as she put her hand into the one outstretched to meet it .
Parsing [sent. 3471 len. 43]: Then as she met the grave tenderness of the gaze that was turned upon her , for the first time she broke down and sobbed out a wild appeal : `` Oh , find him for me -- find him for me !
Parsing [sent. 3472 len. 12]: He has run away , and it is all my fault .
Parsing [sent. 3473 len. 33]: I brought him to this terrible city , and shut him up in an office all day long ; and Barney is such a restless creature ; he ca n't endure confinement .
Parsing [sent. 3474 len. 25]: If he got into trouble here , when we were all near him , what will Income of him now when he is alone ?
Parsing [sent. 3475 len. 7]: Oh , find him for me !
Parsing [sent. 3476 len. 24]: Bring him back -- '' `` I will , Miss Philippa , if it is humanly possible , '' replied the Hermit gravely .
Parsing [sent. 3477 len. 26]: And then Madge 's story was retold , and the question raised again as to how Barney had come into possession of so much money .
Parsing [sent. 3478 len. 16]: `` I can account for some of it at least , '' Mr Neil said .
Parsing [sent. 3479 len. 20]: `` I saw that the boy was troubled , and found out that he was in need of money .
Parsing [sent. 3480 len. 11]: Eventually he asked me for the loan of five pounds .
Parsing [sent. 3481 len. 16]: I said , ` My boy , you must not begin borrowing at your age .
Parsing [sent. 3482 len. 15]: It is a bad habit , and I wo n't encourage you in it .
Parsing [sent. 3483 len. 35]: But I had made up my mind to give you a cheque for a Christmas present ; and you shall have it in advance , if that would be a help to you . '
Parsing [sent. 3484 len. 19]: He said it would , and I gave him the five pounds for which he had asked . ''
Parsing [sent. 3485 len. 8]: `` It was not right of you .
Parsing [sent. 3486 len. 2]: No !
Parsing [sent. 3487 len. 7]: you should not have done it .
Parsing [sent. 3488 len. 9]: It was leading the boy into temptation . ''
Parsing [sent. 3489 len. 23]: Philippa spoke in tones of strong reproach ; but though Mr Neil 's face was troubled , it was in nowise repentant .
Parsing [sent. 3490 len. 54]: `` I have been a boy in an office myself , Miss Philippa , '' he said gently , `` for two years -- two long , miserable years -- and I know -- forgive me for saying so -- that there is an even greater temptation in being too short of money .
Parsing [sent. 3491 len. 34]: When a lad gets his first taste of independence it goes hard with him if he can not indulge in the little luxuries which his companions enjoy ; and the shops seem irresistible .
Parsing [sent. 3492 len. 22]: I hoped that by means of my gift Barney might be able to pay off his debts and start afresh . ''
Parsing [sent. 3493 len. 26]: `` You have been very generous and very forgiving , Mr Neil , '' said Steve ; `` and we are much indebted to you .
Parsing [sent. 3494 len. 8]: But what can we do this morning ?
Parsing [sent. 3495 len. 20]: I must get to the office as soon as I can , for there are already two men away .
Parsing [sent. 3496 len. 15]: It wo n't do for me to lose my berth into the bargain . ''
Parsing [sent. 3497 len. 29]: Steve spoke with a tinge of bitterness , for in truth he found himself in a painful position -- the position of the elder brother in the parable .
Parsing [sent. 3498 len. 57]: He had never got into debt , nor betted , nor failed in a single instance in his duty to his sisters , and it was a little hard to realise , as he did this morning , that to each one of the four -- Phil included -- the curly-headed prodigal was dearer than himself .
Parsing [sent. 3499 len. 18]: He looked at the Hermit , and asked anxiously , `` Can you come with me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3500 len. 10]: `` It is what I was about to propose .
Parsing [sent. 3501 len. 16]: I am my own master , and can give all my time to the search .
Parsing [sent. 3502 len. 36]: We had better go to the office first , and try to discover who was the companion of the tobacconist 's shop ; then if we get a clue I will follow it up . ''
Parsing [sent. 3503 len. 30]: `` Right , '' said Steve , and went into the little hall , to find Hope already brushing the coat which she had taken down from its peg .
Parsing [sent. 3504 len. 37]: She helped him to put it on , turned down the collar at the back , and let her hand rest against his neck as she murmured a few low words : `` Dear old Steve !
Parsing [sent. 3505 len. 8]: What should we do without you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3506 len. 18]: It was always Hope 's way to divine a wound and lay a healing hand upon it .
Parsing [sent. 3507 len. 18]: The two men went straight to the insurance office , and interviewed the manager in his room .
Parsing [sent. 3508 len. 32]: `` Waxworks , '' as Barney had irreverently dubbed him , was unaffectedly grieved to hear of the boy 's flight , and repentant of his own share in the catastrophe .
Parsing [sent. 3509 len. 10]: `` I liked the lad , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3510 len. 8]: `` One could not help liking him .
Parsing [sent. 3511 len. 35]: If I had consulted my own wishes only I should have lectured him and let him stay on , but in a big place like this it is necessary to keep a firm hand .
Parsing [sent. 3512 len. 15]: I had overlooked several breaches of discipline , and it could not go on .
Parsing [sent. 3513 len. 26]: He must be found , of course ; and then , if you take my advice , you will let him live an out-of-door life .
Parsing [sent. 3514 len. 4]: Send him abroad .
Parsing [sent. 3515 len. 12]: He is just the type that is wanted in the colonies .
Parsing [sent. 3516 len. 17]: Now I 'll send for Young , and you can question him as you please . ''
Parsing [sent. 3517 len. 31]: Mr Young , however , had no light to throw upon the subject ; neither had Barney 's special companions among the clerks , who were interviewed in their turn .
Parsing [sent. 3518 len. 27]: The lad had left the office alone , so that the identity of his companion still remained a mystery , which the tobacconist alone could solve .
Parsing [sent. 3519 len. 39]: The two therefore made their way to the little shop , where Madge 's sketch was displayed in all its glory in the window , but neither brother nor friend had the heart to laugh at it to-day .
Parsing [sent. 3520 len. 24]: The tinkling bell announced their entrance to the proprietor , and they lost no time in telling him the object of their visit .
Parsing [sent. 3521 len. 33]: Two young gentlemen had been in the habit of visiting his shop and asking his advice on racing matters , their last call happening the night before , somewhere about five o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 3522 len. 25]: The younger of the two was tall , dark , and handsome ; for private reasons his friends were anxious to interview his companion .
Parsing [sent. 3523 len. 8]: Who was he , and where employed ?
Parsing [sent. 3524 len. 9]: Did the man know or did he not ?
Parsing [sent. 3525 len. 23]: He professed utter ignorance , but there was a slyness on his face which did not escape the notice of his questioners .
Parsing [sent. 3526 len. 34]: A number of gentlemen came to his shop ; sometimes they did happen to talk of a race if it was near at hand ; but he never inquired a customer 's name .
Parsing [sent. 3527 len. 6]: Gentlemen would n't like it .
Parsing [sent. 3528 len. 13]: Could n't say for certain that he remembered the two just mentioned .
Parsing [sent. 3529 len. 5]: `` The man lies .
Parsing [sent. 3530 len. 22]: We will waste no more time on him , '' said the Hermit sternly as he turned away from the door .
Parsing [sent. 3531 len. 24]: `` Go back to your office , Charrington , and leave me to see the police and put an advertisement in the papers .
Parsing [sent. 3532 len. 24]: That is all that we can do at the moment , though I shall not rest until I have tracked that unknown friend .
Parsing [sent. 3533 len. 14]: He will probably be able to tell us more than any one else .
Parsing [sent. 3534 len. 14]: I 'll think out a plan of action for the next few days .
Parsing [sent. 3535 len. 25]: This is my business as well as yours ; for the boy has been like a young brother to me this last year . ''
Parsing [sent. 3536 len. 34]: ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Looking back on the days which followed Barney 's disappearance , the Charringtons were often puzzled to understand how they endured the strain and suspense , and marvelled at their own composure .
Parsing [sent. 3537 len. 60]: Day after day the Hermit continued his search , and came home weary and disappointed ; day by day Philippa listened to his report with a steady face , and abated not one of her usual efforts for the comfort of the household , while the three younger sisters set their teeth and went on doggedly with their work .
Parsing [sent. 3538 len. 70]: `` If we were actresses or public singers we should have to keep our appointments , and smile and look cheerful ; if we were clerks or teachers we should have to turn out as usual , and be patient and forbearing ; if we were shop assistants we should have to stand on our feet all day long , and be polite , however much we were aggravated .
Parsing [sent. 3539 len. 50]: We are poor things if we call ourselves working women and then indulge our feelings like any fine lady , '' Theo had said sternly to two drooping figures who sat by the fire gazing at idle fingers , and she had no need to speak a second time .
Parsing [sent. 3540 len. 42]: In the temporary eclipse of Madge 's bright spirits , Theo had taken upon herself to be the cheery , inspiring member of the family , which role shook her out of the old self-engrossed groove , and suited her well .
Parsing [sent. 3541 len. 36]: Now , as she went into her room and sat down at her desk , her heart swelled with a sense of joy and gratitude for the talent which had been entrusted to her care .
Parsing [sent. 3542 len. 62]: She took up her manuscript and set to work with none of the difficulty and hesitation which often hampered her progress : the thoughts crowded into her brain ; the right word came of itself and did not need to be sought ; the difficult point was overcome , and she laughed with delight at the wittiness of her own dialogue .
Parsing [sent. 3543 len. 30]: Here , then , was a discovery , that even sorrow had its compensation , since it brought with it fresh understanding , earnestness , and delicacy of touch .
Parsing [sent. 3544 len. 19]: When she went in to lunch , the light on her face made her sisters look and wonder .
Parsing [sent. 3545 len. 17]: `` No need to ask how you have fared to-day , Theo , '' Hope said .
Parsing [sent. 3546 len. 23]: `` I do n't know who your characters are at the moment , but they have been good children this morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 3547 len. 12]: `` Could n't be better , '' said the author brightly .
Parsing [sent. 3548 len. 11]: `` So charmingly alive , and saying such witty things !
Parsing [sent. 3549 len. 24]: It is a curious delusion , but when I do my best work I always feel as if some one else suggested it .
Parsing [sent. 3550 len. 24]: I was sad enough in my own heart to-day , but as I wrote a little sprite seemed to whisper in my ear .
Parsing [sent. 3551 len. 7]: The good things _ came _ !
Parsing [sent. 3552 len. 6]: I did n't create them .
Parsing [sent. 3553 len. 30]: I suppose the really great writers often feel like that I am quite sure that when they read over their books they are astounded at their own cleverness . ''
Parsing [sent. 3554 len. 12]: `` It must be a very -- a very agreeable sensation .
Parsing [sent. 3555 len. 12]: I have never been the least little bit surprised at mine .
Parsing [sent. 3556 len. 15]: I tried to work , too , but I did n't get on well .
Parsing [sent. 3557 len. 38]: You two girls make me ashamed of myself , but I think sometimes that I was never meant to be a public character , '' sighed Hope , wrinkling her forehead in her pretty , wistful fashion .
Parsing [sent. 3558 len. 14]: `` I do n't seem to have the faculty of earning money . ''
Parsing [sent. 3559 len. 15]: `` Because nature intended some one else to make it for you , darling !
Parsing [sent. 3560 len. 26]: You are one of the dear , frightened , humble little creatures who need a big strong man to stand between them and the world .
Parsing [sent. 3561 len. 9]: I do hope you will marry , Hope !
Parsing [sent. 3562 len. 10]: Do , please , the first chance you get .
Parsing [sent. 3563 len. 17]: You 'd be ever so much happier , and it would be so agreeable for us .
Parsing [sent. 3564 len. 18]: Marry a rich man who lives in the country , and send us hampers every week ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3565 len. 4]: cried unsuspecting Madge .
Parsing [sent. 3566 len. 34]: It seemed natural enough to the others that Hope should blush at the suggestion ; only Theo understood the meaning of that blush , and the train of thought which suggested the reply .
Parsing [sent. 3567 len. 12]: `` I think I shall go to see Avice this afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 3568 len. 19]: I promised Steve that I would call before the end of the week if we had no news .
Parsing [sent. 3569 len. 25]: He does n't want uncle to hear about Barney in town ; he might be annoyed that we had not told him ourselves . ''
Parsing [sent. 3570 len. 44]: When Hope saw her aunt 's face , however , she knew at a glance that she was too late with her news , and sat meekly listening to the tirade which followed , thankful that she was the listener instead of Philippa .
Parsing [sent. 3571 len. 29]: Her gentleness was her best weapon , however ; for , having said her say , Mrs Loftus began to soften and to regret having spoken so strongly .
Parsing [sent. 3572 len. 30]: Argument or contradiction would have incensed her still further ; but how could one go on scolding a pretty , timid creature who merely sat still and looked miserable ?
Parsing [sent. 3573 len. 19]: She paused , frowned , and finally asked the amount of the debts which Barney had left behind .
Parsing [sent. 3574 len. 16]: `` Everything , I mean -- the whole sum for which you are liable . ''
Parsing [sent. 3575 len. 14]: `` I think , perhaps -- I 'm afraid nearly t-twenty pounds ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3576 len. 32]: The gasp with which Hope replied was for the magnitude of the sum mentioned ; the echoing gasp from the other side of the fireplace was for an exactly opposite reason .
Parsing [sent. 3577 len. 6]: `` Only twenty pounds ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3578 len. 10]: cried Avice ; `` the price of a gown !
Parsing [sent. 3579 len. 8]: The poor boy ran away for that !
Parsing [sent. 3580 len. 21]: Hope dear , I will pay it myself ; I will give it to you this afternoon before you go .
Parsing [sent. 3581 len. 12]: You sha 'n' t be worried about it any more . ''
Parsing [sent. 3582 len. 8]: `` It is paid already , dear .
Parsing [sent. 3583 len. 7]: Steve saw to that at once .
Parsing [sent. 3584 len. 23]: You are very kind , but Barney would not like it , and we have a good deal of money still left .
Parsing [sent. 3585 len. 9]: Philippa drew it out of the bank . ''
Parsing [sent. 3586 len. 15]: `` You will be in the workhouse soon , '' Mrs Loftus prophesied cheerfully .
Parsing [sent. 3587 len. 17]: `` I never heard anything more mad than to spend your capital as you are doing .
Parsing [sent. 3588 len. 15]: Just think of the inroads you must have made into it this year ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3589 len. 15]: `` I 'd rather not , Aunt Loftus , if you do n't mind .
Parsing [sent. 3590 len. 24]: It is always the first step which costs , but we have made a start , and hope to do wonders next year .
Parsing [sent. 3591 len. 16]: At the worst I shall avoid the workhouse by throwing myself on Avice 's mercy .
Parsing [sent. 3592 len. 17]: -- You would have me down at the lodge , would n't you , dear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3593 len. 37]: The glance exchanged between the two cousins was full of confidence and affection , and Avice 's voice had a new ring of animation as she replied : `` I should like to have you always .
Parsing [sent. 3594 len. 3]: Oh Hope !
Parsing [sent. 3595 len. 19]: I _ do _ enjoy shopping now , and seeing the girls who were with us in summer .
Parsing [sent. 3596 len. 23]: Mother is quite scandalised because we talk so much , but being with them does me more good than I can say .
Parsing [sent. 3597 len. 16]: And the conjurer 's daughter is going to be married -- to a magic-lantern man !
Parsing [sent. 3598 len. 11]: I thought of having them down for their honeymoon . ''
Parsing [sent. 3599 len. 53]: `` Avice is far more interested in that engagement than she is in Truda Bennett 's ; and she is to be one of Truda 's bridesmaids , too , '' said Mrs Loftus in a puzzled tone as she pushed back her chair and rose from her place before the tea-table .
Parsing [sent. 3600 len. 20]: Hope rose too , with an impulse of escape , and bent down to pick up muff and gloves .
Parsing [sent. 3601 len. 33]: Her heart had given a great leap of fear , and was beating in heavy throbs , but she said savagely to herself , `` You _ sha 'n' t _ blush !
Parsing [sent. 3602 len. 8]: You sha 'n' t look startled ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3603 len. 9]: and turned an unmoved face to her aunt .
Parsing [sent. 3604 len. 5]: `` Miss Bennett engaged !
Parsing [sent. 3605 len. 7]: I did n't , know . ''
Parsing [sent. 3606 len. 19]: `` You ca n't have used your eyes , then , when you were with us last year .
Parsing [sent. 3607 len. 4]: They flirted shockingly !
Parsing [sent. 3608 len. 9]: It ought to have been announced long ago .
Parsing [sent. 3609 len. 15]: By the way , Hope , we go down to The Shanty next week .
Parsing [sent. 3610 len. 11]: You had better come with us for a little visit .
Parsing [sent. 3611 len. 20]: I meant to write and ask you , and you look pale -- as if you needed a change .
Parsing [sent. 3612 len. 11]: We shall be almost the same party as before . ''
Parsing [sent. 3613 len. 8]: `` Dear aunty , I ca n't .
Parsing [sent. 3614 len. 19]: It is good of you to think of it , but I could n't leave home just now .
Parsing [sent. 3615 len. 18]: I should be so anxious and troubled that I should be of no use to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3616 len. 8]: `` You must come later , then .
Parsing [sent. 3617 len. 16]: It will be all the same to us , but the others will be disappointed .
Parsing [sent. 3618 len. 19]: Truda asks after you continually , and Ralph Merrilies said he looked forward to some more delightful music .
Parsing [sent. 3619 len. 9]: I wish you could come , Hope . ''
Parsing [sent. 3620 len. 22]: `` He wanted to meet me , then , '' said Hope drearily to herself as she took her way home .
Parsing [sent. 3621 len. 30]: `` It 's just as I always thought : he cared for me only as a friend , and was kind to me because I was poor and friendless .
Parsing [sent. 3622 len. 11]: He must have grown fond of Truda , after all .
Parsing [sent. 3623 len. 7]: She is so bright and amusing !
Parsing [sent. 3624 len. 24]: I suppose she showed him tricks and made him laugh ; and he is so serious himself that he needs some one cheerful .
Parsing [sent. 3625 len. 11]: I hope he will be very , very happy . ''
Parsing [sent. 3626 len. 13]: Her eyes smarted suddenly , and a sob swelled in her throat .
Parsing [sent. 3627 len. 12]: `` But oh , I wish I had never met him !
Parsing [sent. 3628 len. 8]: I wish I was not so wretched !
Parsing [sent. 3629 len. 15]: Truda had so many other things , and I could have made him happy .
Parsing [sent. 3630 len. 16]: It is hateful of me , but I believe I should make a nicer wife .
Parsing [sent. 3631 len. 9]: I should have been so good to him !
Parsing [sent. 3632 len. 3]: Oh Ralph !
Parsing [sent. 3633 len. 3]: Ralph ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3634 len. 5]: Alas , poor Hope !
Parsing [sent. 3635 len. 24]: She pulled down her thick veil , and cried quietly behind its shelter as she wended her way home through the busy streets .
Parsing [sent. 3636 len. 4]: CHAPTER TWENTY TWO .
Parsing [sent. 3637 len. 4]: AN UNEXPECTED CLUE .
Parsing [sent. 3638 len. 11]: Ten days passed by and brought no news of Barney .
Parsing [sent. 3639 len. 31]: Steve devoted every spare moment to the search , the Hermit was unremitting in his efforts , but with the best will in the world they proved but poor detectives .
Parsing [sent. 3640 len. 30]: The tobacconist remained stubbornly uncommunicative , and as Madge would not have recognised Barney 's companion if she had seen him , it was little use watching the shop .
Parsing [sent. 3641 len. 34]: The insurance clerks were interviewed again and again , but Barney had been prudent in one respect at least -- he had not breathed a word of his betting transactions in the office .
Parsing [sent. 3642 len. 57]: He had vaguely mentioned `` a friend of mine '' -- `` a fellow I know , '' but had given no names , and the consensus of opinion was that he must have picked up acquaintances in the luncheon hour , when , boy-like , he was fond of wandering about from place to place .
Parsing [sent. 3643 len. 39]: The Hermit lunched diligently in all the principal restaurants in the neighbourhood of the office , and made a point of entering into conversation with his companions , but he failed to meet any one who remembered Barney .
Parsing [sent. 3644 len. 7]: `` I am at a standstill .
Parsing [sent. 3645 len. 9]: I do n't know what to do next .
Parsing [sent. 3646 len. 37]: I am afraid there is very little of the Sherlock Holmes about me , Miss Philippa , '' he said dejectedly on the tenth afternoon , as he detailed the history of the day 's search .
Parsing [sent. 3647 len. 39]: It had become a custom for him to come upstairs to tell his story and to be refreshed with tea and scones , and the girls welcomed his advent as a break in the long , anxious day .
Parsing [sent. 3648 len. 40]: So far he had brought no good news , but while he was devoting so much time to their service , they felt bound to cheer him for his disappointments , and the effort was good for themselves also .
Parsing [sent. 3649 len. 47]: `` Never mind ; if you were Sherlock Holmes you would n't be yourself , and you are a much pleasanter neighbour as you are , '' replied Philippa as she lifted the little copper kettle from its stand and poured the water into the teapot .
Parsing [sent. 3650 len. 33]: She kept her face turned aside so that he might not see the disappointment written upon it , and reminded herself for the hundredth time that she could afford to be patient .
Parsing [sent. 3651 len. 11]: Had not Barney promised to keep straight for her sake ?
Parsing [sent. 3652 len. 39]: Perhaps , after all , this separation from home might teach him its value as no amount of petting and spoiling would have done , and on his return he would show a gentler , more disciplined spirit .
Parsing [sent. 3653 len. 15]: Philippa would never allow herself to believe that this absence was more than temporary .
Parsing [sent. 3654 len. 22]: She handed the plate of home-made scones to the Hermit , smiling the while with some of her old mischievous brightness .
Parsing [sent. 3655 len. 4]: `` Hungry ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3656 len. 6]: `` I had steak to-day .
Parsing [sent. 3657 len. 26]: I find , on the whole , that steak suits me best , '' replied the Hermit , screwing up his eyes in judicial fashion .
Parsing [sent. 3658 len. 14]: `` It 's so tough that it takes a long time to despatch .
Parsing [sent. 3659 len. 11]: Then , again , it takes ten minutes to prepare .
Parsing [sent. 3660 len. 22]: I calculate that I can while away a good half-hour on a plate of steak , to say nothing of after-courses .
Parsing [sent. 3661 len. 37]: In this way I get several changes of companions , and I manage to work round the conversation until I can bring in Barney 's name , and inquire if they happen to have met him .
Parsing [sent. 3662 len. 12]: I am getting quite skilled in the exigencies of small-talk . ''
Parsing [sent. 3663 len. 10]: `` Poor thing , and you hate it so !
Parsing [sent. 3664 len. 23]: It is noble of you to persevere as you do , for I am sure there is nothing you dislike more . ''
Parsing [sent. 3665 len. 10]: `` No , no ; do n't say that .
Parsing [sent. 3666 len. 6]: It is good for me .
Parsing [sent. 3667 len. 22]: I have studied books too much , and men too little , in my life -- to my own great loss .
Parsing [sent. 3668 len. 24]: Before you took me in hand a year ago I was a veritable hermit , and the old habits cling about me still .
Parsing [sent. 3669 len. 26]: I feel terribly rusty among all those bright , alert young fellows , and they treat me as if I belonged to a different species .
Parsing [sent. 3670 len. 13]: Do you -- do you notice anything pedantic in my manner ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3671 len. 40]: All four girls were in the room , but it was to Philippa that he addressed the question ; he had a way of looking at her when he spoke , of which the girl herself was gratefully conscious .
Parsing [sent. 3672 len. 36]: Theo and Madge -- even Hope herself -- had a way of treating her with affectionate patronage as a dear , kind , preoccupied Martha who could not be expected to understand their higher flights .
Parsing [sent. 3673 len. 28]: She had suffered beneath this treatment , and was delighted that these fledglings should now see in what estimation she was held by a scholar of repute .
Parsing [sent. 3674 len. 12]: `` You are the _ kindest _ man I ever met .
Parsing [sent. 3675 len. 52]: There is no one else among our friends who would jeopardise his digestion by eating tough steak day after day in the hope of doing us a service , '' she cried , deftly evading a direct answer , which , if honest , must needs have been in the affirmative .
Parsing [sent. 3676 len. 15]: Theo 's hand advanced cautiously and gave a meaning pressure to Madge 's elbow .
Parsing [sent. 3677 len. 11]: Madge stared into space , with wooden stolidity of feature .
Parsing [sent. 3678 len. 18]: Hope looked wistfully from Philippa to the hermit , from the Hermit back to Philippa once more .
Parsing [sent. 3679 len. 17]: Then suddenly came the sound of the electric bell , followed by a silence of expectation .
Parsing [sent. 3680 len. 9]: It might portend a letter or a telegram .
Parsing [sent. 3681 len. 7]: It might be even Barney himself !
Parsing [sent. 3682 len. 50]: Mary opened the door , and some one entered the tiny passage to an accompaniment of gasps and groans and rustlings of silken skirts ; the air became laden with scent , and a second after Minnie Caldecott staggered into the room and sank down on the nearest chair .
Parsing [sent. 3683 len. 6]: `` Where is your lift ?
Parsing [sent. 3684 len. 14]: You horrible girls , what do you mean by not having a lift ?
Parsing [sent. 3685 len. 7]: I 'm _ dead _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3686 len. 55]: she announced tragically , fanning herself with the ends of a chiffon boa , and puffing and blowing in quite an alarming fashion , until , suddenly catching sight of the Hermit at the other end of the room , she sat up straight in her chair and recovered her breath with remarkable celerity .
Parsing [sent. 3687 len. 32]: The Charrington girls had never before seen the fair Minnie in the presence of a member of the opposite sex , and the scene which followed filled them with delighted amusement .
Parsing [sent. 3688 len. 48]: The lady elaborately prepared herself for the fray , set her hat at a more becoming angle , pulled out the little curls under the veil , and while ostensibly addressing herself to her friends , sent fascinating glances across the room with her big blue eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3689 len. 20]: The man hunched his shoulders , screwed up his brows , and looked helplessly miserable and ill at ease .
Parsing [sent. 3690 len. 26]: He would have given the world to escape , but the buxom figure barred the way , and he lacked the courage to pass by .
Parsing [sent. 3691 len. 15]: There was nothing for it but to sit still until she chose to depart .
Parsing [sent. 3692 len. 16]: `` Well , I 'm thankful I have found you at home after that climb .
Parsing [sent. 3693 len. 20]: You must think twice before you go out , when you live in a bird 's nest like this .
Parsing [sent. 3694 len. 17]: I nearly turned back , but I wanted particularly to see you about some business . ''
Parsing [sent. 3695 len. 14]: She caught Hope 's eager glance , and shook her head in reply .
Parsing [sent. 3696 len. 7]: `` Nothing for you , dear .
Parsing [sent. 3697 len. 6]: No more songs just now .
Parsing [sent. 3698 len. 3]: I say !
Parsing [sent. 3699 len. 6]: you _ are _ white .
Parsing [sent. 3700 len. 5]: What 's the matter ?
Parsing [sent. 3701 len. 6]: Have you been ill ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3702 len. 5]: `` Not ill exactly .
Parsing [sent. 3703 len. 9]: We have had an anxious time lately . ''
Parsing [sent. 3704 len. 50]: Hope could not bring herself to speak of Barney to Minnie Caldecott , and her cheeks grew pink even as she spoke , for she knew that she was using the boy 's disappearance as a cloak behind which to hide the real trouble which was sapping her strength .
Parsing [sent. 3705 len. 29]: Miss Caldecott nodded her head , however , as though she understood all about the matter , and said cheerfully : `` Still trying to make your fortune !
Parsing [sent. 3706 len. 21]: Better give it up , my dear , and follow my example : I 'm going to be married . ''
Parsing [sent. 3707 len. 23]: She threw a deprecatory glance at the Hermit , as though condoling with him on his own late arrival on the scene .
Parsing [sent. 3708 len. 11]: `` Told you I should come to that before long !
Parsing [sent. 3709 len. 68]: Fact is , the public is getting tired of me and running after newer singers , and I must do something to improve my position , so the day is fixed for the third week in January ; and on the fifteenth of December Minnie Caldecott gives a grand farewell concert , when all her friends in the profession will give their services for her benefit . ''
Parsing [sent. 3710 len. 7]: `` How kind of them ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3711 len. 3]: said Hope .
Parsing [sent. 3712 len. 9]: `` I hope you will be very happy .
Parsing [sent. 3713 len. 10]: But are you really going to retire so soon ?
Parsing [sent. 3714 len. 22]: Your voice is so fresh still -- you are so young -- '' The bride-elect laughed her large , hearty laugh .
Parsing [sent. 3715 len. 10]: `` How old should you think I was ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3716 len. 23]: she inquired ; and this time she addressed the Hermit in such a marked manner that he could not choose but reply .
Parsing [sent. 3717 len. 38]: He looked annoyed , however , and the pedantic manner was at its height as he said shortly , `` I am afraid I must confess that I have not thought about the subject at all . ''
Parsing [sent. 3718 len. 5]: `` Think now ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3719 len. 12]: said Minnie , staring at him with her wide blue eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3720 len. 31]: She was like a big baby , Madge reflected -- a huge wax doll -- just as smooth and pink-and-white and chubby -- just as vacant and soulless in expression .
Parsing [sent. 3721 len. 5]: `` Out with it !
Parsing [sent. 3722 len. 32]: Do n't be afraid , '' she cried ; and the Hermit , thus goaded , ventured a leap in the dark : `` I should say somewhere about thirty . ''
Parsing [sent. 3723 len. 10]: Miss Caldecott turned a horrified face towards her friends .
Parsing [sent. 3724 len. 14]: `` Well , _ he _ does n't know how to pay compliments .
Parsing [sent. 3725 len. 5]: -- Thirty , indeed !
Parsing [sent. 3726 len. 18]: I 'm only twenty-nine , and in the profession we always knock off at least five years .
Parsing [sent. 3727 len. 9]: No , I am not going to retire .
Parsing [sent. 3728 len. 9]: I know a trick worth two of that .
Parsing [sent. 3729 len. 57]: A few months later there will be another concert -- ` first appearance since her marriage ' -- and a year or two after that a second farewell ; but I want to make a big splash with this first one , and it occurred to me the other day that you might help me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3730 len. 15]: Her eyes wandered round the room until they rested on Madge 's thin face .
Parsing [sent. 3731 len. 8]: `` You are the one I want .
Parsing [sent. 3732 len. 11]: You designed that swell leaflet for your sister 's entertainment .
Parsing [sent. 3733 len. 20]: Do n't you think it would be a good chance for you to do one for me now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3734 len. 6]: Madge looked at her quizzically .
Parsing [sent. 3735 len. 42]: The Charringtons had learned by this time that , in spite of her beaming good-nature , Miss Caldecott was a keen business woman , and that in dealing with her it was necessary to look well after one 's own interests .
Parsing [sent. 3736 len. 49]: `` I am not certain that I can undertake any fresh orders just now ; I am so busy with my advertisements , '' Madge replied grandiloquently , glancing at the table in the window on which lay the roll of the nursery frieze , now approaching completion .
Parsing [sent. 3737 len. 28]: As she had expected , Miss Caldecott insisted upon seeing it , and went into raptures over a spirited rendering of `` Hi Diddle , Diddle . ''
Parsing [sent. 3738 len. 57]: The cat was evidently of Cheshire origin , to judge from its bland and benign expression ; the cow was in the act of drawing itself together for the fateful leap , while the moon rolled apprehensive eyes towards it , and the little dog clasped its fore-legs over its heart in an ecstasy of amusement .
Parsing [sent. 3739 len. 15]: In the distance a gentlemanly-looking dish was dragging a swooning spoon in its wake .
Parsing [sent. 3740 len. 57]: It was very funny , very clever , very original ; for Madge , like Theo , had been working at high pressure , and had been inspired to do her best in the hope of paying off a part at least of Barney 's debts , and thereby giving a sop to her troubled conscience .
Parsing [sent. 3741 len. 45]: `` I am not quite sure who shall have it , Mason 's or Fearing 's , '' she said languidly , mentioning the two largest West End furnishers , in reply to Miss Caldecott 's inquiry as to the destination of the design .
Parsing [sent. 3742 len. 15]: `` It depends , of course , upon which makes the highest offer . ''
Parsing [sent. 3743 len. 34]: She turned her head cautiously to grimace at her sisters , and beheld the Hermit wreathed in smiles , nodding encouragement , waving his hand as if imploring her to keep it up .
Parsing [sent. 3744 len. 50]: His delight , contrasted with the baffled expression on Minnie 's chubby face , proved almost too much , for Madge 's composure , but she busied herself with covering up the sketches , and presently returned to her seat , and smiled with bland patronage upon her visitor .
Parsing [sent. 3745 len. 11]: `` And now -- er -- about this concert ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3746 len. 36]: `` Herman is going to sing , and Marie Ross , and -- '' Miss Caldecott reeled off the names of half-a-dozen well-known artistes , checking them on her fingers with an air of triumph .
Parsing [sent. 3747 len. 10]: `` They are all _ giving _ their services .
Parsing [sent. 3748 len. 13]: My dear , it would be the finest advertisement you could have .
Parsing [sent. 3749 len. 25]: Make up something original and striking in the way of a programme , and they will all be eating out their hearts with jealousy .
Parsing [sent. 3750 len. 15]: You do n't know what we are in the profession , but I do .
Parsing [sent. 3751 len. 31]: And you may take it from me that every one of them will determine on the spot that she will have something even better when it comes to her turn .
Parsing [sent. 3752 len. 10]: You will have your name printed in the corner .
Parsing [sent. 3753 len. 37]: I will crack you up as the coming artist , and they will all be running after you , and giving you more commissions than you can take -- '' `` On the same terms ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3754 len. 4]: queried Madge blandly .
Parsing [sent. 3755 len. 14]: `` Because if so , I hardly see where the artist comes in .
Parsing [sent. 3756 len. 11]: There must be reciprocity in these things , Miss Caldecott .
Parsing [sent. 3757 len. 7]: I can not work for nothing .
Parsing [sent. 3758 len. 24]: Now , for instance , if you were going to sing Hope 's song -- '' Miss Caldecott looked shocked at the suggestion .
Parsing [sent. 3759 len. 9]: `` My dear girl , it 's impossible .
Parsing [sent. 3760 len. 20]: I 'm booming three songs for publishers just now , and get half-a-guinea apiece every time I sing them .
Parsing [sent. 3761 len. 22]: That is what Hope should do : get some firm to push her things , and pay for having them sung .
Parsing [sent. 3762 len. 11]: She will never make a name until she does . ''
Parsing [sent. 3763 len. 21]: `` Just so ; but as she is young and unknown , they do n't feel inclined to help her .
Parsing [sent. 3764 len. 19]: It would help matters considerably if you would give ` The Song of Sleep ' at your concert .
Parsing [sent. 3765 len. 23]: You might possibly lose ten-and-sixpence , but , on the other hand , my charge for an illustrated programme is five guineas !
Parsing [sent. 3766 len. 10]: You would have the best of the bargain . ''
Parsing [sent. 3767 len. 15]: In the silence which followed the Hermit 's chuckle of delight was distinctly audible .
Parsing [sent. 3768 len. 29]: Minnie looked at him sharply , nodded her head as if in sympathy with his enjoyment , and cried laughingly : '' _ She 'll _ get on !
Parsing [sent. 3769 len. 5]: No fear for her !
Parsing [sent. 3770 len. 12]: Knows how to look after herself , and her sister too .
Parsing [sent. 3771 len. 26]: Very well , then , it shall be an encore ; but you must do your best for me , mind -- something very fetching .
Parsing [sent. 3772 len. 16]: If you could give a hint of a wedding it would be a good idea .
Parsing [sent. 3773 len. 15]: I do n't want the audience to think I am retiring through old age .
Parsing [sent. 3774 len. 5]: Thirty , indeed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3775 len. 31]: and she threw an indignant glance at the Hermit , the while Madge laughed , and suggested : `` Wedding-bells , and a wreath of orange-blossoms as a bordering ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3776 len. 5]: `` Yes , yes !
Parsing [sent. 3777 len. 4]: Just the thing !
Parsing [sent. 3778 len. 25]: Bring the sketch to show me , and we can consult about it together , for I really ca n't manage these stairs again .
Parsing [sent. 3779 len. 10]: I 'm so pleased it 's all settled ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3780 len. 43]: She rose as she spoke , and prepared to take her leave , but as she did so her eye fell on the row of photographs on the chimneypiece , and she walked forward to examine them in her usual free-and-easy fashion .
Parsing [sent. 3781 len. 4]: `` Family pictures !
Parsing [sent. 3782 len. 11]: There is Hope -- not half pretty enough , though .
Parsing [sent. 3783 len. 8]: That was your father , I suppose .
Parsing [sent. 3784 len. 7]: So clever , was n't he !
Parsing [sent. 3785 len. 15]: By the way , how is that young brother of yours getting on ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3786 len. 26]: If a thunderbolt had fallen through the roof , the occupants of the room could hardly have been more startled than by this simple question .
Parsing [sent. 3787 len. 35]: This was Miss Caldecott 's first visit to the flat ; Barney 's name had never been mentioned in her presence ; how , then , did she come to know of his existence ?
Parsing [sent. 3788 len. 33]: The shadow which had been pushed aside for a few minutes now returned more heavily than ever , and the pale , tense faces of the four girls startled the innocent questioner .
Parsing [sent. 3789 len. 6]: `` What is the matter ?
Parsing [sent. 3790 len. 5]: What have I said ?
Parsing [sent. 3791 len. 9]: Nothing to worry you , have I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3792 len. 12]: `` We are in trouble about our brother , Miss Caldecott .
Parsing [sent. 3793 len. 23]: He has -- disappeared , '' said Philippa , resting both hands on the back of a chair to hide their trembling .
Parsing [sent. 3794 len. 14]: `` Do you mind telling us how you came to know him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3795 len. 17]: `` But I do n't know him ; only heard his name casually from a friend .
Parsing [sent. 3796 len. 7]: Handsome boy , is n't he ?
Parsing [sent. 3797 len. 18]: -- musical -- sings comic songs and dances break-downs -- up to all sorts of fun ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3798 len. 6]: `` Yes , yes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3799 len. 25]: cried the sisters in concert , and the Hermit drew near , forgetting his embarrassment in his anxiety to hear what might be told .
Parsing [sent. 3800 len. 37]: The five pairs of eyes were fixed hungrily on the silly , pretty face , and even as they looked they saw it change , soften into sympathy , and grow sweet and earnest and womanly .
Parsing [sent. 3801 len. 10]: `` And he has run away , has he ?
Parsing [sent. 3802 len. 15]: And you are sitting at home waiting for him , and breaking your hearts .
Parsing [sent. 3803 len. 4]: Poor little girls !
Parsing [sent. 3804 len. 16]: Would n't it be lovely if I helped you to find him , after all ?
Parsing [sent. 3805 len. 10]: Now , I 'll tell you all I know .
Parsing [sent. 3806 len. 28]: I had some friends in the other night , and one of the men was turning over my songs and found ` The Song of Sleep . '
Parsing [sent. 3807 len. 19]: We laughed about it a good deal , for I told him it was half my own composition .
Parsing [sent. 3808 len. 40]: He noticed the name -- Hope Charrington -- and said he knew a young fellow of that name ; who was one of the most amusing boys he had ever met , and could sing a rattling comic song .
Parsing [sent. 3809 len. 22]: He is musical , this man I am speaking of , and is fond of having little singsongs at his rooms .
Parsing [sent. 3810 len. 34]: I asked one or two questions , found out that it must be your brother , and told Jim I would warn you that he was not a fit companion for a lad .
Parsing [sent. 3811 len. 37]: Oh , I was only in fun ; there 's no real harm in Jim , but he is in rather a fast , betting set , and I have a young brother of my own .
Parsing [sent. 3812 len. 31]: I know how I should feel about it I determined to give you a hint next time we met , and I _ did _ remember , did n't I ?
Parsing [sent. 3813 len. 10]: I am so glad I did n't forget ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3814 len. 17]: The look of elation which accompanied the last words brought a smile to Hope 's face .
Parsing [sent. 3815 len. 39]: She had reason to know Miss Caldecott 's powers of forgetting , and it argued a wonderful amount of interest that she should have , remembered Barney in the midst of the exciting preparations for her benefit concert .
Parsing [sent. 3816 len. 20]: She slipped her hand through the plump arm and pressed it gently , while Philippa asked half-a-dozen breathless questions .
Parsing [sent. 3817 len. 7]: `` How long ago was that ?
Parsing [sent. 3818 len. 6]: Have you heard nothing since ?
Parsing [sent. 3819 len. 6]: Where had he met Barney ?
Parsing [sent. 3820 len. 8]: Is he in an insurance office ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3821 len. 3]: `` Insurance ?
Parsing [sent. 3822 len. 7]: No , that is not it .
Parsing [sent. 3823 len. 14]: He has quite a good berth somewhere -- shipping office , I think .
Parsing [sent. 3824 len. 9]: Their ships go out to the Cape . ''
Parsing [sent. 3825 len. 32]: She drew her breath sharply as she finished her sentence , and , to judge by the startled look which went round , the same thought had flashed through every mind .
Parsing [sent. 3826 len. 2]: Shipping !
Parsing [sent. 3827 len. 8]: Ships that went out to the Cape !
Parsing [sent. 3828 len. 12]: What better means by which to frustrate the most diligent search ?
Parsing [sent. 3829 len. 53]: Barney had always had a craving for the sea , and if this unknown `` Jim '' had influence in his office , and felt himself even indirectly responsible for the trouble in which the boy found himself , what more likely than that he would help him to a fresh start ?
Parsing [sent. 3830 len. 18]: `` I should n't wonder one bit if that is the explanation , '' cried Minnie triumphantly .
Parsing [sent. 3831 len. 23]: `` Two to one he has gone off in one of their boats ; and a very good thing if he has .
Parsing [sent. 3832 len. 14]: Nothing knocks the nonsense out of a boy like a good long voyage .
Parsing [sent. 3833 len. 20]: He 'll be so thankful to get back that he will settle down to anything you like to mention .
Parsing [sent. 3834 len. 11]: Got into trouble , I suppose , before he went ?
Parsing [sent. 3835 len. 7]: Nothing serious , I hope . ''
Parsing [sent. 3836 len. 30]: She had shown herself so kind and sympathetic that Philippa could not refuse to reply , and Minnie listened to the story of Barney 's debts with indulgent sympathy .
Parsing [sent. 3837 len. 9]: `` And so he ran away from them .
Parsing [sent. 3838 len. 13]: Just what I have longed to do myself a dozen times over .
Parsing [sent. 3839 len. 17]: Now , you will want to see Jim , and hear what he has to say .
Parsing [sent. 3840 len. 24]: I shall be passing near his lodgings on my way home , and if Mr -- er -- Neil , is n't it ?
Parsing [sent. 3841 len. 13]: -- likes to come with me , we might interview him together .
Parsing [sent. 3842 len. 12]: He gets home by half-past five , as a rule . ''
Parsing [sent. 3843 len. 34]: She looked coquettishly at the Hermit , who was immediately seized with a paroxysm of embarrassment , twitched nervous fingers , and looked as supremely miserable as if his last hour had come .
Parsing [sent. 3844 len. 32]: With the energy of despair he managed to blurt out a few words to the effect that -- `` Stephen -- Mr Charrington -- home presently -- like to be present .
Parsing [sent. 3845 len. 17]: After dinner , perhaps -- could go together if Miss Caldecott kindly -- left address . ''
Parsing [sent. 3846 len. 14]: `` Well , _ he _ does n't know how to flirt ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3847 len. 21]: Minnie exclaimed blightingly five minutes later as she and Hope stood in the little hall for a few parting words .
Parsing [sent. 3848 len. 9]: `` Ca n't understand a man like that .
Parsing [sent. 3849 len. 6]: No patience with him either .
Parsing [sent. 3850 len. 11]: No relation of yours , I hope , dear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3851 len. 20]: `` None whatever ; but , oh Minnie , you should not want to flirt when you are engaged !
Parsing [sent. 3852 len. 22]: I do hope you are not going to be married just because you are tired and discouraged and need a rest .
Parsing [sent. 3853 len. 15]: I do trust you are not making a mistake , '' cried Hope earnestly .
Parsing [sent. 3854 len. 16]: `` Are you quite sure you care for hint , and can be happy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3855 len. 5]: Miss Caldecott laughed lightly .
Parsing [sent. 3856 len. 28]: `` My dear , '' she said , `` if I look thirty in my best new veil , it is more than time I was married .
Parsing [sent. 3857 len. 11]: And I am so tired of paying my own bills !
Parsing [sent. 3858 len. 15]: Jack is very well off , and I intend to make his money fly .
Parsing [sent. 3859 len. 17]: It will be a new experience to spend money that some one else has earned . ''
Parsing [sent. 3860 len. 41]: She paused , looked for a moment into Hope 's wistful face , and added impulsively , `` If you will promise faithfully never to tell Jack if you should meet him , I 'll let you into a secret .
Parsing [sent. 3861 len. 5]: I 'm frightfully happy !
Parsing [sent. 3862 len. 10]: I 've been in love with him for years .
Parsing [sent. 3863 len. 38]: It was difficult to make up my mind when I had been my own mistress for so long , but now that I _ have _ given in , I would n't go back for the world .
Parsing [sent. 3864 len. 17]: It is nice to be loved and taken care of -- far nicer than being independent .
Parsing [sent. 3865 len. 12]: You will find that out for yourself some day soon . ''
Parsing [sent. 3866 len. 9]: `` Dear Minnie , I am so glad !
Parsing [sent. 3867 len. 15]: I do congratulate you with all my heart ; and ` Jack ' too .
Parsing [sent. 3868 len. 13]: You will make such a nice , cheerful , good-tempered wife ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3869 len. 22]: cried Hope bravely ; whereat Miss Minnie indulged in an elephantine byplay of bashfulness , and ran rustling down the staircase .
Parsing [sent. 3870 len. 6]: `` An appalling woman ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3871 len. 19]: the Hermit was reiterating in the drawing-room ; but none of the sisters would agree with this denunciation .
Parsing [sent. 3872 len. 19]: `` She does n't wear her heart on her sleeve ; neither do we , '' maintained Hope .
Parsing [sent. 3873 len. 14]: `` She is ever so much nicer when you know her well . ''
Parsing [sent. 3874 len. 9]: `` She shows great perspicuity in her judgment .
Parsing [sent. 3875 len. 14]: Did you hear her say that I was sure to get on ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3876 len. 12]: cried Madge ; and Theo smiled as at a pleasant recollection .
Parsing [sent. 3877 len. 15]: `` Did you notice how her face softened when we spoke of our trouble ?
Parsing [sent. 3878 len. 13]: Her lips drooped , and her eyes grew so soft and liquid .
Parsing [sent. 3879 len. 10]: My next heroine shall have eyes like that . ''
Parsing [sent. 3880 len. 31]: `` And if she helps us to find Barney , '' sighed Philippa softly , `` I shall bless the name of Minnie Caldecott as long as I live . ''
Parsing [sent. 3881 len. 4]: CHAPTER TWENTY THREE .
Parsing [sent. 3882 len. 2]: REJOICINGS .
Parsing [sent. 3883 len. 48]: It can be imagined with what eagerness Steve was greeted on his return from the City that evening , how he was hurried through his dinner , and despatched forthwith , in company with the Hermit , to interview `` Jim , '' otherwise Mr James Matthews .
Parsing [sent. 3884 len. 28]: The time of waiting seemed unbearably long , but when the two men returned it was at once evident that they were the bearers of good news .
Parsing [sent. 3885 len. 34]: The companion of the newspaper shop had been found at last , while Barney himself was now on his way to the Cape , working for his passage in the capacity of steward !
Parsing [sent. 3886 len. 14]: Briefly , the tale which Mr Matthews had to tell was as follows .
Parsing [sent. 3887 len. 30]: He had made the boy 's acquaintance in a luncheon-bar , had been attracted by his breezy , high spirits , and taken some pains to arrange further meetings .
Parsing [sent. 3888 len. 39]: The two had attended theatres and concerts together , and finally Barney had visited his new friend in his rooms , and become the confidant of certain betting transactions in which he was in the habit of indulging .
Parsing [sent. 3889 len. 93]: The boy had begun to bet on his own account , had been unlucky , and had called at the shipping office one day , declaring himself in trouble at home , and anxious to get out of the country for a time at least Mr Matthews told him that his only chance was to ship as a steward , and Barney , being not only willing but eager , was sent to wait his turn at Southampton , and had been fortunate in finding an opening three days after his arrival .
Parsing [sent. 3890 len. 25]: `` Jim , '' as Miss Caldecott had called him , appeared to be a good-natured , easy-going individual with little sense of responsibility .
Parsing [sent. 3891 len. 61]: When sternly questioned by Steve as to whether he considered it right to encourage a boy of seventeen to bet , he smilingly declared that `` every one did it -- even the little office-boys put their coppers on the races ; '' and refused altogether to acknowledge that he should have consulted Barney 's friends before sending him abroad .
Parsing [sent. 3892 len. 12]: `` But you were the very people he wanted to avoid .
Parsing [sent. 3893 len. 12]: There is no need to worry yourself , my good sir .
Parsing [sent. 3894 len. 39]: He has signed for the round voyage , and you will see him back in a couple of months , all the better for having to rough it a bit and finding out what hard work means . ''
Parsing [sent. 3895 len. 21]: This was his opinion , and , on the whole , Barney 's brother and sisters were inclined to agree .
Parsing [sent. 3896 len. 38]: After the suspense of the past weeks it was a blessed relief to hear definite news , and , with a good ship and a good captain , there was little fear of the boy 's safety .
Parsing [sent. 3897 len. 49]: There was just a chance that letters written at once might arrive at Capetown before the vessel sailed on her homeward voyage , and Philippa was already rehearsing loving messages , when Madge cried eagerly : `` Ca n't we _ do _ something to celebrate the occasion ?
Parsing [sent. 3898 len. 9]: Not to-night , I mean , but to-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 3899 len. 16]: We have been in the depths for so long that we need a little festivity .
Parsing [sent. 3900 len. 10]: I 'm _ tired _ of being miserable ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3901 len. 46]: She felt a passing wonder as to the moaning of Hope 's quick frown , but Theo chimed in with an eager assent , and even the grave Steve stretched himself , as if throwing off a burden , and looked pleased at the suggestion .
Parsing [sent. 3902 len. 13]: `` I believe we should all be the better for a change .
Parsing [sent. 3903 len. 19]: There has been too much work and too little play lately to be good for any of us .
Parsing [sent. 3904 len. 15]: The question is , what can we do that is cheap and exciting ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3905 len. 9]: Madge 's grimace was the reverse of approving .
Parsing [sent. 3906 len. 15]: `` The greatest change we could have would be to be expensive and lazy .
Parsing [sent. 3907 len. 27]: It is not my idea of pleasure to stand shivering in a queue for a couple of hours , and hunt for omnibuses after a performance .
Parsing [sent. 3908 len. 24]: I want to see how the other people live -- the people who toil not , neither wear their last year 's clothes !
Parsing [sent. 3909 len. 60]: I should like to dine at the Carlton , and sit in the hall after dinner watching the coming and going -- the pretty girls in their fashion-plate cloaks , and the old ladies in sables and diamonds , going out to theatres and evening receptions -- and watch the flirtations , and listen to Theo making up stories .
Parsing [sent. 3910 len. 17]: It would be so good for us both ; we should get lots of ideas . ''
Parsing [sent. 3911 len. 22]: `` I 'm afraid '' -- began Steve the prudent , but the Hermit did not give him time to finish .
Parsing [sent. 3912 len. 16]: `` I will engage a table at the Carlton to-morrow morning , '' he cried .
Parsing [sent. 3913 len. 10]: `` You shall all come and dine with me .
Parsing [sent. 3914 len. 6]: It is a capital idea .
Parsing [sent. 3915 len. 13]: I 'm very much obliged to Miss Madge for suggesting it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3916 len. 8]: Polite murmurs of dissent greeted this speech .
Parsing [sent. 3917 len. 20]: Steve cried , `` No , no , my dear fellow ; we could n't think of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3918 len. 20]: Philippa blushed , and declared , `` You must n't , Mr Neil ; you really must n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 3919 len. 11]: But the Hermit was firm and would brook no refusal .
Parsing [sent. 3920 len. 25]: `` It is impossible for me to entertain at home , and it is quite time that you dined with me for a change .
Parsing [sent. 3921 len. 12]: I have been your guest for about fifty Sunday-night suppers . ''
Parsing [sent. 3922 len. 16]: `` Cold roast beef and beetroot in winter ; cold lamb and mint-sauce in summer !
Parsing [sent. 3923 len. 24]: There is an appalling lack of variety in the menus of an English household , '' said Madge , with an expressive grimace .
Parsing [sent. 3924 len. 20]: `` When I am married I shall make a point of serving my loved one with constant surprises . ''
Parsing [sent. 3925 len. 11]: `` You will find it more difficult than painting pictures .
Parsing [sent. 3926 len. 25]: What is one to do in winter , when poultry is so dear and none of the nice spring things have come in ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3927 len. 59]: queried the dear , literal Martha , looking straight at the Hermit as she spoke , as if asking him to vindicate her housekeeping abilities ; the which he proceeded to do with a zeal untempered by knowledge , while Hope studied his face with anxious eyes , and Madge sat silent , a monument of long-chinned solemnity .
Parsing [sent. 3928 len. 68]: No further objections were made to the Hermit 's invitation -- which , in truth , was too tempting to be refused -- and the next morning was spent in hunting up old fineries , turning ribbons , washing laces , and sewing them on again in as near an imitation of the latest Parisian fashion as could be obtained with insufficient quantities and ` prentice fingers .
Parsing [sent. 3929 len. 15]: `` To think that it is eighteen months since I wore an evening-dress ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3930 len. 4]: sighed Madge tragically .
Parsing [sent. 3931 len. 21]: `` Do you remember how I talked of holding a _ salon _ for all the greatest intellects in London !
Parsing [sent. 3932 len. 24]: It is rather a come-down to reflect that the Hermit is the only youngish man who has crossed this threshold since we came .
Parsing [sent. 3933 len. 26]: And he is no good to me either , for '' -- She looked round the room to make sure that Philippa was not present .
Parsing [sent. 3934 len. 10]: `` I 'll tell you a secret , Theo .
Parsing [sent. 3935 len. 36]: He is -- not falling -- he could not do anything so precipitate -- but _ crawling _ in love with Phil ; but he will never find it out unless somebody tells him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3936 len. 9]: `` I 'll tell you another stale item .
Parsing [sent. 3937 len. 19]: Phil is crawling in love with him too ; but wild horses would n't make her confess it .
Parsing [sent. 3938 len. 50]: If he ever winds himself up to proposing , she will refuse him for the sake of the family and never say a word about it , but only snap off our heads , and grow so cross and cantankerous that there will be no living with her . ''
Parsing [sent. 3939 len. 4]: This from Theo .
Parsing [sent. 3940 len. 26]: The other ungrateful sister shrugged her shoulders and exclaimed , `` What a nuisance it is when people _ will _ make martyrs of themselves !
Parsing [sent. 3941 len. 50]: Now , it would really be very nice if Phil lived on the next landing , and could run in and out half-a-dozen times a day ; and though the Hermit is not my passion , he is a worthy old thing , and would make a devoted husband .
Parsing [sent. 3942 len. 20]: It strikes me , my dear , that you and I will have to take this matter in hand .
Parsing [sent. 3943 len. 7]: It is no use asking Hope .
Parsing [sent. 3944 len. 15]: She has grown so proper lately that I am quite afraid of her . ''
Parsing [sent. 3945 len. 11]: `` Oh no , we wo n't ask Hope ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3946 len. 4]: said Theo quickly .
Parsing [sent. 3947 len. 24]: `` But really it would be rather fun to see what we could do -- as good as a story in real life .
Parsing [sent. 3948 len. 13]: The first step is to make them aware of their own feelings .
Parsing [sent. 3949 len. 9]: But how is it to be done ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3950 len. 6]: `` We might try jealousy .
Parsing [sent. 3951 len. 16]: How would it be if I flirted with him violently under her very eyes ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3952 len. 37]: `` He would be horribly bored , without understanding in the least what you were trying to do , and Phil would forbid him the house in case you were blighted in your youthful affections . ''
Parsing [sent. 3953 len. 25]: `` Should we take him aside , then , and drop a casual hint of the curate who proposed to her in Leabourne ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3954 len. 26]: `` My dear , he would take fright on the moment and consider it his duty to stand aside in favour of a better man .
Parsing [sent. 3955 len. 14]: He is so absurdly quixotic that he would positively enjoy immolating himself . ''
Parsing [sent. 3956 len. 7]: `` What about pity , then ?
Parsing [sent. 3957 len. 19]: Snub Phil violently in his presence , and confide to her in secret that his cough sounds consumptive !
Parsing [sent. 3958 len. 19]: That would make them sorry for each other , you see , and rouse a desire to help .
Parsing [sent. 3959 len. 21]: They would sympathise , and grow sentimental , and -- '' `` It might do , '' said Theo thoughtfully .
Parsing [sent. 3960 len. 19]: `` Really , Madge , you ought to write instead of me ; you are far more inventive .
Parsing [sent. 3961 len. 6]: My only idea is propinquity .
Parsing [sent. 3962 len. 32]: Impress upon Phil that the Hermit is her best counsellor in all matters concerning Barney , and advise her to talk things over quietly with him when Steve is not present .
Parsing [sent. 3963 len. 27]: The Hermit has about as much worldly wisdom as a babe in arms , and consequently would be immensely flattered by being asked to impart it .
Parsing [sent. 3964 len. 27]: He will repeat all her suggestions with an air of wisdom , and Phil will dote upon him for helping her to her own way . ''
Parsing [sent. 3965 len. 5]: `` Propinquity does it !
Parsing [sent. 3966 len. 18]: We will be as innocent as cherubs , and have smashing headaches when he comes to call .
Parsing [sent. 3967 len. 32]: Also , it might be well to take a more active share in the housekeeping department , in order to show Phil that she is not so indispensable as she imagines .
Parsing [sent. 3968 len. 9]: We must be cruel to be kind . ''
Parsing [sent. 3969 len. 25]: Theo 's shoulders shook with laughter , and just at that moment in marched Philippa herself , looking round with an air of surprise .
Parsing [sent. 3970 len. 11]: `` What is the matter with you two this morning !
Parsing [sent. 3971 len. 10]: You are giggling like a couple of schoolgirls . ''
Parsing [sent. 3972 len. 12]: `` We are so excited at the prospect of this evening !
Parsing [sent. 3973 len. 13]: What have _ you _ been so busy about in your room ?
Parsing [sent. 3974 len. 5]: Writing to Barney ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3975 len. 15]: `` N-not just lately , '' faltered Phil , and blushed in guilty fashion .
Parsing [sent. 3976 len. 41]: As a matter of fact she had been trying experiments in hairdressing , and studying her profile to see which arrangement gave the best effect to -- er -- to any one who happened to be seated by her side !
Parsing [sent. 3977 len. 11]: `` How ore you getting on with your work ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3978 len. 36]: she asked , eager to change the subject , when Madge held up the venerable chiffon bodice on which she had been sewing `` applications '' of lace , and regarded it with critical approval .
Parsing [sent. 3979 len. 12]: `` Subdued elegance is to be the keynote of my costume .
Parsing [sent. 3980 len. 6]: I shall wear no jewels !
Parsing [sent. 3981 len. 18]: I do n't think it is in good taste for a young girl to wear valuable diamonds .
Parsing [sent. 3982 len. 10]: What do you think of the arrangement of lace ?
Parsing [sent. 3983 len. 19]: Exact copy of one of Lady Godiva 's dinner-dresses as drawn in last week 's _ Queen _ .
Parsing [sent. 3984 len. 18]: Would n't it be thrilling if I were mistaken for her and written about in the papers ?
Parsing [sent. 3985 len. 15]: The only drop of bitterness in my cup is the want of an evening-cloak .
Parsing [sent. 3986 len. 14]: It does give one away so horribly to go in a golf-cape ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3987 len. 9]: `` No one will know you , dear .
Parsing [sent. 3988 len. 8]: No one will look at you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3989 len. 12]: `` Do you mean that for comfort , may I ask ?
Parsing [sent. 3990 len. 9]: I _ want _ to be looked at .
Parsing [sent. 3991 len. 36]: ` 'T is sad to think no eye will watch for us , and grow brighter when we come , ' '' quoted Madge in sentimental accents , which made Philippa giggle in her turn .
Parsing [sent. 3992 len. 16]: Then for some mysterious reason she blushed again , and strolled over towards the window .
Parsing [sent. 3993 len. 6]: `` Hot , dear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3994 len. 4]: queried Madge blandly .
Parsing [sent. 3995 len. 12]: `` Room rather warm , perhaps -- too big fire . ''
Parsing [sent. 3996 len. 13]: `` So extravagant , too , on a mild day like this !
Parsing [sent. 3997 len. 20]: I really must speak to Mary about using so much coal , '' said Theo , with a frown .
Parsing [sent. 3998 len. 19]: She went on with her sewing , apparently unconscious of the wide-eyed amazement with which Philippa regarded her .
Parsing [sent. 3999 len. 19]: The skies were going to fall indeed when Miss Theo troubled herself about an item of domestic economy !
Parsing [sent. 4000 len. 21]: There was something rather pathetic about the glee with which the four sisters made their toilets a few hours later .
Parsing [sent. 4001 len. 35]: The night 's entertainment , which would have seemed so tame and ordinary to most girls of their age , appeared a very frenzy of excitement after their year of hard work and privation .
Parsing [sent. 4002 len. 41]: They laughed and chattered like so many magpies , ran about from room to room in lace petticoats and pretty low bodices , and sat in turns before the dining-room fire , while Hope -- happy possessor of natural curls !
Parsing [sent. 4003 len. 35]: -- heated irons and waved and crimped with such artistic skill that , as Madge gleefully declared , the three heads were ` transformations ' indeed -- far more like toupees than natural growth .
Parsing [sent. 4004 len. 53]: Philippa wore her mother 's lace , which gave a regal air to the old black silk dress ; Hope was lovely , as usual , in her professional white ; Madge 's `` subdued elegance '' proved exceedingly becoming ; but Theo was distinctly the most imposing figure of the four .
Parsing [sent. 4005 len. 101]: She possessed the Frenchwoman 's talent for putting on her clothes and adding those little touches which go so far towards making an effective whole , and her sisters exclaimed with surprised admiration as she came rustling into the drawing-room , a chaplet of violets crowning the graceful head , and a couple of black feathers fastened jauntily at the side of the low corsage by a paste buckle , which looked exactly like a family heirloom , and not in the least as if it had been unpicked from the side of a felt hat but ten minutes before .
Parsing [sent. 4006 len. 39]: Thrown over her shoulders , too , was quite a vision in the way of evening-cloaks , manufactured out of a summer cape , a lace collar , and the beloved feather boa tacked on as an edging .
Parsing [sent. 4007 len. 52]: The cape was unlined , and far too thin a covering for a winter evening ; but , girl-like , Theo declared that she was `` broiled , '' and insisted that suffocation would be the result of wearing the nice , warm , ugly shawl which Philippa pressed upon her .
Parsing [sent. 4008 len. 33]: The Hermit came upstairs in his dress-clothes , bearing in his hands four immaculate white camellias , which had seemed to his old-fashioned notions appropriate offerings to present to his girl guests .
Parsing [sent. 4009 len. 17]: It was sweet of him to have thought of flowers at all , but -- camellias !
Parsing [sent. 4010 len. 38]: Theo thanked her stars for the violets which she was already wearing , and dashed from the room to warn Madge , who promptly stole the chrysanthemums from the dinner-table and pinned them in a conspicuous position .
Parsing [sent. 4011 len. 46]: Hope , of course , was too gentle to refuse what had been meant so kindly ; while as for Philippa , to judge by her ejaculations of delight , it would appear that nothing under the sun could have given her so much pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 4012 len. 30]: They drove away from the door in a couple of four-wheelers , two happy , smiling girls on either back seat , faced by a hungry , dress-coated man .
Parsing [sent. 4013 len. 37]: The dinner was everything that fancy had painted it : all sorts of delightful things to eat , disguised under French names , and looking so pretty that it seemed a sin to disturb the dishes .
Parsing [sent. 4014 len. 35]: Music , lights , interesting people all around , at whom it was a pleasure to look , and who looked back in their turn , as if equally pleased by what they saw .
Parsing [sent. 4015 len. 23]: Steve grew quite frisky in his enjoyment , and Philippa and the Hermit became delightfully and unconsciously absorbed in their own conversation .
Parsing [sent. 4016 len. 35]: The little party lingered over dessert , loath to leave so interesting a position , but the settees in the hall were presently discovered to afford an even better vantage-ground for observing their neighbours .
Parsing [sent. 4017 len. 13]: Steve came over and demanded a place beside his three younger sisters .
Parsing [sent. 4018 len. 13]: `` Neil is submitting the synopsis of his next book to Phil .
Parsing [sent. 4019 len. 27]: You seem much jollier over here , '' he said innocently , and the girls watched Philippa 's absorbed face in an ecstasy of admiration . ''
Parsing [sent. 4020 len. 9]: _ Does n't _ she do it well ?
Parsing [sent. 4021 len. 19]: Who would think , to look at her , that the very title is beyond her comprehension ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4022 len. 18]: They turned aside to hide their smiles , and became once more absorbed in their old occupation .
Parsing [sent. 4023 len. 57]: Fascinating groups of people appeared at every moment , and it was no use deciding that you would have your next new dress made exactly like this one , and making surreptitious sketches on the back of the menu card , for it was no sooner lost to sight than another appeared fifty times more distracting .
Parsing [sent. 4024 len. 11]: `` I do feel a worm among them all ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4025 len. 28]: grumbled Madge ; but when Steve considerately offered to take her home , she said , `` Thank you , dear ; I 'm enjoying it dreadfully .
Parsing [sent. 4026 len. 9]: I would n't go for _ worlds _ .
Parsing [sent. 4027 len. 22]: -- Hope , there is a girl over there to the right who is staring at you with all her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4028 len. 12]: Pretend to look after this man and you 'll see her .
Parsing [sent. 4029 len. 9]: There -- by the lady in blue . ''
Parsing [sent. 4030 len. 32]: Hope looked , exclaimed in surprise , and the next moment she and the strange girl had risen and walked forward to meet each other in the middle of the hall .
Parsing [sent. 4031 len. 10]: `` Miss Bennett , is it really you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4032 len. 4]: `` Hope Charrington !
Parsing [sent. 4033 len. 7]: The idea of meeting you here !
Parsing [sent. 4034 len. 10]: I 've so often wanted to see you again !
Parsing [sent. 4035 len. 11]: Sit down here and talk to me for a minute .
Parsing [sent. 4036 len. 5]: Are those your sisters ?
Parsing [sent. 4037 len. 20]: They are not like you -- not so pretty ; but the one with the violets looks very smart .
Parsing [sent. 4038 len. 17]: You are thin , but you are one of those horrid creatures who always look nice .
Parsing [sent. 4039 len. 7]: What do you think of me ?
Parsing [sent. 4040 len. 5]: Do I look worn ?
Parsing [sent. 4041 len. 20]: Brides always look wrecks ; and I vowed I would n't , but I 'm tired to death already .
Parsing [sent. 4042 len. 9]: I 've come up to buy my clothes .
Parsing [sent. 4043 len. 7]: It 's to be in February .
Parsing [sent. 4044 len. 7]: You heard , of course ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4045 len. 5]: `` Avice told me .
Parsing [sent. 4046 len. 6]: I must congratulate you now .
Parsing [sent. 4047 len. 9]: I suppose you are very happy ? '' ''
Parsing [sent. 4048 len. 6]: _ He _ is ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4049 len. 4]: laughed Truda meaningly .
Parsing [sent. 4050 len. 6]: `` Quite daft about me !
Parsing [sent. 4051 len. 19]: You met him , of course , down at The Shanty , and he liked you awfully much .
Parsing [sent. 4052 len. 22]: We have often talked of you , and arranged to have you down when we have a party to entertain . ''
Parsing [sent. 4053 len. 6]: Hope smiled with stiff lips .
Parsing [sent. 4054 len. 12]: He had liked her `` awfully much , '' had he ?
Parsing [sent. 4055 len. 18]: So much that he had wished to have her as a visitor when Truda was his wife !
Parsing [sent. 4056 len. 23]: Oh , what a fool , fool , fool she had been to imagine for a moment that he had really cared !
Parsing [sent. 4057 len. 12]: `` You will live in the country , I suppose ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4058 len. 12]: she remarked ; and again Truda laughed and wagged her head .
Parsing [sent. 4059 len. 36]: `` He thinks we will , and I am very meek and submissive _ note _ , but I 'll have a town-house before a year is over ; you see if I do n't !
Parsing [sent. 4060 len. 18]: What is the use of all my lovely clothes in a poky little bit of a village ?
Parsing [sent. 4061 len. 8]: Would you like to see my dresses ?
Parsing [sent. 4062 len. 17]: I 'll take you with me to the dressmaker 's some day if you like . ''
Parsing [sent. 4063 len. 15]: `` Thank you , but I am afraid I could not spare the time .
Parsing [sent. 4064 len. 11]: It is very kind of you to ask me . ''
Parsing [sent. 4065 len. 7]: `` Oh , not a bit !
Parsing [sent. 4066 len. 13]: It would have amused me and been a day off for mamma .
Parsing [sent. 4067 len. 11]: Still writing songs and giving story-telling entertainments , are you ?
Parsing [sent. 4068 len. 8]: Oh , I heard all about it .
Parsing [sent. 4069 len. 12]: I was bothered to death to find engagements for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4070 len. 16]: Truda lay back in her chair and looked curiously into the fair , troubled face .
Parsing [sent. 4071 len. 9]: `` Seen anything of Ralph Merrilies lately ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4072 len. 18]: Hope 's embarrassment was swallowed up in surprise at so casual a reference to a future husband .
Parsing [sent. 4073 len. 15]: `` No , '' she said emphatically -- `` not for nearly six months .
Parsing [sent. 4074 len. 18]: I never meet him except at my aunt 's house , and I go there very seldom .
Parsing [sent. 4075 len. 11]: He does not call on us in our flat . ''
Parsing [sent. 4076 len. 6]: `` I wonder why not .
Parsing [sent. 4077 len. 11]: He was awfully smitten with you ; and was n't .
Parsing [sent. 4078 len. 5]: I furious about it ?
Parsing [sent. 4079 len. 21]: He had been quite attentive to me before you came , and then he had eyes for no one else .
Parsing [sent. 4080 len. 12]: I believe I was quite jealous of you , dear . ''
Parsing [sent. 4081 len. 8]: `` You had no reason to be .
Parsing [sent. 4082 len. 10]: You feel that now , do n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4083 len. 12]: said Hope gently , and Truda gave a complacent little laugh .
Parsing [sent. 4084 len. 9]: `` Oh , I do n't mind now .
Parsing [sent. 4085 len. 9]: He may care as much as he likes .
Parsing [sent. 4086 len. 16]: Reggie is a good little soul ; I 'm quite satisfied with him . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 4087 len. 5]: _ Reggie _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4088 len. 10]: `` Reggie , of course -- Charles Reginald Blake .
Parsing [sent. 4089 len. 6]: Who else should it be ?
Parsing [sent. 4090 len. 23]: Hope Charrington , you _ do n't _ mean to tell me that you imagined -- '' `` Of course I did !
Parsing [sent. 4091 len. 6]: It 's your own fault .
Parsing [sent. 4092 len. 9]: You told me -- do n't you remember ?
Parsing [sent. 4093 len. 27]: -- you told me yourself that you liked him , and warned me -- '' For once Truda had the grace to blush and look discomfited .
Parsing [sent. 4094 len. 15]: `` Oh well , of course , there was always _ some one _ .
Parsing [sent. 4095 len. 25]: I was rather smitten , but I could not go on caring for a man who had the bad taste to prefer another girl .
Parsing [sent. 4096 len. 7]: And Reggie has been so faithful !
Parsing [sent. 4097 len. 15]: He used to send me chocolates when I was at school in Brighton . ''
Parsing [sent. 4098 len. 13]: `` He is a dear little man -- so amiable and cheery .
Parsing [sent. 4099 len. 18]: There will be quite a competition between you as to who shall play off a trick first .
Parsing [sent. 4100 len. 10]: I hope you will ask me down some day .
Parsing [sent. 4101 len. 31]: You _ will _ be a merry couple , '' cried Hope , with such a heart-whole laugh as had not been heard from her for many a long day .
Parsing [sent. 4102 len. 6]: Miss Bennett regarded her curiously .
Parsing [sent. 4103 len. 6]: `` How pleased you seem !
Parsing [sent. 4104 len. 8]: Oh yes , I 'll ask you .
Parsing [sent. 4105 len. 16]: But perhaps you may be '' -- her eyes twinkled -- `` previously engaged . ''
Parsing [sent. 4106 len. 4]: CHAPTER TWENTY FOUR .
Parsing [sent. 4107 len. 7]: ALL 'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL .
Parsing [sent. 4108 len. 52]: One dark December morning Theo found a letter lying on her plate on the breakfast-table ; not the long , white envelope addressed in her own writing , which her soul abhorred , but a business-looking epistle , stamped on which was the magic name of _ The Casket Magazine _ .
Parsing [sent. 4109 len. 37]: She gulped , tore open the envelope , and read the golden news : `` I have read with much interest your original little story , and have pleasure in accepting it for the magazine . ''
Parsing [sent. 4110 len. 13]: `` Your original little story -- have pleasure in accepting it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4111 len. 13]: Theo gulped again , and laughed with the tears in her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4112 len. 11]: Oh , how often she had dreamt of this moment !
Parsing [sent. 4113 len. 17]: How she had longed for it , and sickened with dread lest it should never come !
Parsing [sent. 4114 len. 17]: She turned a radiant face upon her sisters , and waved her letter in the air .
Parsing [sent. 4115 len. 3]: `` Hurrah !
Parsing [sent. 4116 len. 3]: At last !
Parsing [sent. 4117 len. 4]: From Mr Hammond !
Parsing [sent. 4118 len. 12]: He has accepted my story , and calls it very original .
Parsing [sent. 4119 len. 8]: A story in the _ Casket _ !
Parsing [sent. 4120 len. 7]: Girls , do you realise it ?
Parsing [sent. 4121 len. 19]: Do you realise how you are honoured by sitting at the same table with _ me _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4122 len. 17]: She laughed again , in tremulous fashion , and Madge bowed elaborately , coffee-cup in hand .
Parsing [sent. 4123 len. 7]: `` Your health , my dear !
Parsing [sent. 4124 len. 5]: I look towards you !
Parsing [sent. 4125 len. 7]: You have done it this time .
Parsing [sent. 4126 len. 20]: To be a contributor to the _ Casket _ is like being hung on the line in the Academy .
Parsing [sent. 4127 len. 12]: Sha 'n' t I brag about you at the Slade ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4128 len. 8]: `` It is simply splendid , dear .
Parsing [sent. 4129 len. 11]: I do hope they will put your name to it .
Parsing [sent. 4130 len. 16]: It will be so disappointing if they do n't , '' said Philippa the tactless .
Parsing [sent. 4131 len. 17]: She was overflowing with sympathy with Theo in her success , and yet , poor dear !
Parsing [sent. 4132 len. 50]: she must needs call attention to the one existing drawback ; for the _ Casket _ was as conservative as it was high-class -- scorned to invite popularity by illustrations or artistic cover , and more often than not left a blank opposite the titles of stories and articles .
Parsing [sent. 4133 len. 27]: It was at such moments as these that Theo felt that she could endure with resignation Philippa 's speedy marriage and departure from the home circle .
Parsing [sent. 4134 len. 58]: Only five minutes since she had heard the wonderful news , and already a little cloud came floating across the brightness of the sky ; for it was little use appearing in the best magazine of the day if no one knew of it but yourself , and an admiring public remained in ignorance of your name .
Parsing [sent. 4135 len. 13]: `` How _ horrid _ of you to suggest such a thing !
Parsing [sent. 4136 len. 15]: You might let me enjoy myself when I can , '' she cried irritably .
Parsing [sent. 4137 len. 21]: `` You are a perfect wet blanket , Philippa -- always sitting on us , and depreciating what we do .
Parsing [sent. 4138 len. 16]: It is too bad -- spoiling my pleasure when I have waited so long . ''
Parsing [sent. 4139 len. 3]: `` I !
Parsing [sent. 4140 len. 14]: _ I _ spoil your pleasure -- _ I _ depreciate you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4141 len. 10]: Philippa was fairly gasping with surprise and wounded feeling .
Parsing [sent. 4142 len. 10]: `` When I slave for you all day long !
Parsing [sent. 4143 len. 19]: When I take everything off your hands , so that you may give your time to your work !
Parsing [sent. 4144 len. 11]: When it is through me you are here at all !
Parsing [sent. 4145 len. 22]: You cruel , ungrateful girl , how can you have the heart to speak to me in such a way ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4146 len. 14]: `` I 'm sure I do n't want you to slave for me .
Parsing [sent. 4147 len. 16]: I am quite capable of doing my own mending , if you refer to that .
Parsing [sent. 4148 len. 24]: I should _ like _ to take more share in the housekeeping , but you are so jealous if any one interferes . ''
Parsing [sent. 4149 len. 3]: `` Jealous !
Parsing [sent. 4150 len. 4]: Oh , oh !
Parsing [sent. 4151 len. 3]: Jealous ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4152 len. 4]: repeated Philippa dramatically .
Parsing [sent. 4153 len. 8]: Her eyes were beginning to grow tearful .
Parsing [sent. 4154 len. 28]: Theo 's dark brows met in an ominous frown ; there were all the signs of a row royal , when Hope came flying to the rescue .
Parsing [sent. 4155 len. 11]: `` Girls , girls , _ be quiet _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4156 len. 13]: she cried , banging her fist on the table in imperative fashion .
Parsing [sent. 4157 len. 15]: `` You shall _ not _ quarrel when we ought to be so happy !
Parsing [sent. 4158 len. 22]: This is the best success we have had , and it would be disgraceful to spoil it by quarrelling like babies .
Parsing [sent. 4159 len. 23]: You are both to blame , so no apologies are needed , but for goodness ' sake smile and look pleasant . ''
Parsing [sent. 4160 len. 10]: `` I 'm sure I am only too willing .
Parsing [sent. 4161 len. 14]: I want to smile if I am allowed , '' said Theo gloomily .
Parsing [sent. 4162 len. 11]: `` I 'm sure I do n't want to quarrel .
Parsing [sent. 4163 len. 27]: Perhaps I had better go away and leave you to yourselves , since I am such a wet blanket , '' sniffed Philippa into her pocket-handkerchief .
Parsing [sent. 4164 len. 22]: Madge gave Hope a warning kick under the table , and began to chatter as unconcernedly as if nothing had occurred .
Parsing [sent. 4165 len. 28]: `` You can always write ` Contributor to the _ Casket , etc _ , ' beneath your name on the back of your MSS , Theo .
Parsing [sent. 4166 len. 17]: No need to mention that the _ et cetera _ means the _ Penny Penman _ !
Parsing [sent. 4167 len. 31]: And if you intimate to all whom it may concern that you write anonymously for the _ Casket _ , you may get credit for half-a-dozen stories instead of one .
Parsing [sent. 4168 len. 17]: I wonder what they will pay you for it , and how soon it will appear .
Parsing [sent. 4169 len. 7]: Wo n't the Hermit be impressed ?
Parsing [sent. 4170 len. 10]: He says it is the only magazine worth reading .
Parsing [sent. 4171 len. 20]: Do knock at the door and tell him , Phil , as you go out for your shopping . ''
Parsing [sent. 4172 len. 33]: Wily Madge wished to offer a sop to each of the combatants , and had the satisfaction of seeing Philippa smile faintly , and the complacent expression return to Theo 's face .
Parsing [sent. 4173 len. 20]: `` I knew it was a splendid story when I sent it off , '' said the author modestly .
Parsing [sent. 4174 len. 18]: `` Ten pounds at least , I should think , as it is such a first-class magazine .
Parsing [sent. 4175 len. 15]: It took me less than four days , with all the correction and rewriting .
Parsing [sent. 4176 len. 12]: Ten pounds a week ; how much is that a year ?
Parsing [sent. 4177 len. 23]: If I earned five hundred a year it would make a difference in our exchequer , would n't it , Phil ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4178 len. 38]: The olive branch was held out with a smile , and as Philippa checked herself on the verge of remarking that it would be difficult to sell a story a week , peace was restored once more .
Parsing [sent. 4179 len. 21]: The housekeeper went about her duties , and the author experienced that alternate elation and depression which follows artistic success .
Parsing [sent. 4180 len. 43]: She had created something of real merit and power ; that was a thrilling reflection , but quickly following came the dreary certainty that virtue had gone out of her , and she would never be able to do so well again .
Parsing [sent. 4181 len. 21]: She hastened to her desk , hoping to disprove the dread by writing something better still ; but , alas !
Parsing [sent. 4182 len. 27]: her heroine sulked persistently , refused to be cajoled into conversation , and after being dragged through half-a-dozen pages , was promptly condemned to the flames .
Parsing [sent. 4183 len. 20]: It appeared that even when one had begun to ascend the ladder there was imminent danger of falling off !
Parsing [sent. 4184 len. 45]: Years later , when Theo had made a name for herself as an author of power and originality , she used to look back on that morning and smile at her own ignorance in having supposed for a moment that the battle was won .
Parsing [sent. 4185 len. 19]: It was only begun , and it was a battle which had to be waged to the end .
Parsing [sent. 4186 len. 43]: There could be no sitting down and congratulating one 's self on victory ; no relaxation of care and study , for each fresh success brought its onus of responsibility , and made it more imperative for her to maintain her best .
Parsing [sent. 4187 len. 45]: There were times when she thought wearily of Mr Hammond 's suggestion of `` the bonnet-shop , '' and realised that millinery would have been easier end more remunerative , but there was never an hour when she regretted her choice of a career .
Parsing [sent. 4188 len. 20]: It seemed to her that no other work could be so absorbing -- such a constant refuge from self .
Parsing [sent. 4189 len. 43]: Fortune had evidently made up her mind to smile upon the Charrington sisters this Christmas-tide , for Minnie Caldecott approved enthusiastically of the design for her concert programme , and the nursery frieze found a purchaser the first time it was exhibited .
Parsing [sent. 4190 len. 67]: Madge had summoned courage to show the latter to `` Pepper '' on its completion , when he found a dozen faults , and made huge pencil-markings to illustrate his meaning , the while the artist writhed in agony ; but finally he turned up trumps in the most delightful manner by giving her an introduction to the firm with whom she finally transacted her bargain .
Parsing [sent. 4191 len. 46]: Judging from the experiences of the past few months , she had a future before her in this particular branch of her art , and might in time make a comfortable income ; but it was not in the least the work she had coveted .
Parsing [sent. 4192 len. 21]: She burned to create great subjects on great canvases -- to paint with strong , lurid brush -- and lo !
Parsing [sent. 4193 len. 18]: it appeared that it was her mission to design pretty leaflets and comic pictures for the nursery .
Parsing [sent. 4194 len. 30]: It was a blow , but Madge had the good sense to realise that it is better to excel in humble work than to struggle painfully after the unattainable .
Parsing [sent. 4195 len. 34]: As for Hope , she sang and danced about the house with a sudden return to her old light spirits , which puzzled two sisters , and furnished valuable copy to a third .
Parsing [sent. 4196 len. 27]: The short interview with Truda Bennett had made everything rose-coloured again , though in truth it was a trifle exasperating to remember Mrs Loftus 's invitation .
Parsing [sent. 4197 len. 48]: Oh , to think that even now she might have been at The Shanty , with no secret promise to hinder her enjoyment of Ralph 's society ; that they might have been walking together along the country lanes ; sitting side by side in the evenings !
Parsing [sent. 4198 len. 10]: `` That tonic has given you quite a colour .
Parsing [sent. 4199 len. 29]: I shall try it myself , '' said Philippa , looking up from her stocking-basket to admire the sweet pink-and-white face at the opposite side of the table .
Parsing [sent. 4200 len. 17]: `` Mr Neil was saying the other day that so few town girls have any colour .
Parsing [sent. 4201 len. 22]: I have lost mine with sitting so much in the house , but I might try what a bottle would do .
Parsing [sent. 4202 len. 11]: It only costs a shilling at that wholesale chemist 's .
Parsing [sent. 4203 len. 26]: I do look such a faded old creature beside you , Hope ; and , after all , I am only two years older ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4204 len. 10]: Hope laughed -- a delightfully scornful , reassuring laugh .
Parsing [sent. 4205 len. 7]: `` Faded old creature , indeed !
Parsing [sent. 4206 len. 15]: when we were only remarking this week that you were looking handsomer than ever .
Parsing [sent. 4207 len. 5]: And happier , too .
Parsing [sent. 4208 len. 17]: That 's because Barney will be home so soon ; is n't it , dear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4209 len. 4]: `` Of course .
Parsing [sent. 4210 len. 7]: What else should it be ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4211 len. 16]: said Philippa ; and , to do her justice , she spoke in all sincerity .
Parsing [sent. 4212 len. 83]: Theo 's suggestion that she should consult the Hermit as to Barney 's future had been accepted with an unmoved face , and put into immediate execution ; and as a result of the conference a letter was even now on its way to Mr Neil 's younger brother in Canada , asking if it would be possible to receive the boy as a pupil on his large farm and ranch , and train him for future work on his own account .
Parsing [sent. 4213 len. 38]: Philippa shed bitter tears at the thought of parting from her boy , but the Hermit insisted that it was the right thing to do , though he was much perturbed at the sight of her distress .
Parsing [sent. 4214 len. 14]: `` I seem fated to make you cry , '' he said miserably .
Parsing [sent. 4215 len. 8]: `` Do you remember that first time !
Parsing [sent. 4216 len. 22]: I shall never forget your face , all streaming with tears , and with such a miserable , helpless expression ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4217 len. 17]: `` I must have looked very -- ugly , '' said Philippa , with a sob .
Parsing [sent. 4218 len. 33]: She reflected that by the same course of reasoning she must look ugly now , and dried her eyes with remarkable promptness , while the Hermit sat in admiration of her fortitude .
Parsing [sent. 4219 len. 39]: If Barney was to be at home for a short time only , his sisters were determined to make that time as happy as possible , so that his recollections should carry with them no sting of reproach .
Parsing [sent. 4220 len. 42]: In conclave together they agreed that the dear boy would be embarrassed and depressed , and that all means must be taken to convince him of their full and free forgiveness , and to put him at his ease once more .
Parsing [sent. 4221 len. 12]: `` I shall go to meet him , '' Philippa said .
Parsing [sent. 4222 len. 17]: `` It will be less trying for him than having to see us all at once .
Parsing [sent. 4223 len. 41]: And I am going to put up new curtains in his room -- he hated those old moreen atrocities -- and make it look bright and cheerful , as if it had been kept ready for him all the time .
Parsing [sent. 4224 len. 31]: I 'm going to be so busy this week , I do n't know how I shall get through all I want to do in the way of preparation . ''
Parsing [sent. 4225 len. 4]: Alas for Philippa !
Parsing [sent. 4226 len. 24]: her work during the next few days was to lie in bed and burn and shiver with an attack of the prevalent influenza .
Parsing [sent. 4227 len. 23]: Hope acted nurse , and Theo said blandly , `` Do n't worry , dear ; I will look after the house .
Parsing [sent. 4228 len. 18]: I know exactly what to do '' -- a statement which the invalid received with undisguised incredulity .
Parsing [sent. 4229 len. 21]: `` Shell make an awful mess of it , '' she sighed ; but Theo had no intention of failing .
Parsing [sent. 4230 len. 40]: She was a clever , capable girl , who could do most things well if she chose to give them her attention ; and , as we know , she had a special reason for displaying her housekeeping powers .
Parsing [sent. 4231 len. 41]: She put aside her writing for the time being , studied the cookery-book and the shop windows in the morning , and in the afternoon enveloped herself in a huge white apron and put into practice what she had learned .
Parsing [sent. 4232 len. 67]: All old housekeepers are apt to get into a rut and supply the same dishes over and over again , and Philippa was no exception to the rule , so it happened that the very novelty of Theo 's menus commanded success , and the invalid was constantly assured that she need not hurry out of bed , since all was going on swimmingly without her .
Parsing [sent. 4233 len. 42]: If she shed tears at the intelligence , it was put down to the depression which was a part of the illness , and she was urged to take a cup of Theo 's beef-tea -- `` Such excellent beef-tea ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4234 len. 16]: -- or to take some of Theo 's jelly -- `` Wonderfully good jelly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4235 len. 6]: -- by way of restorative .
Parsing [sent. 4236 len. 10]: There could be no going to meet Barney now .
Parsing [sent. 4237 len. 26]: The most she could do was to crawl out of bed an hour before he was expected and look on feebly at the final preparations .
Parsing [sent. 4238 len. 78]: She searched for a dozen deficiencies -- hoping , if the truth were told , to see tangible proofs of her absence -- but all was orderly , dainty , and appropriate : the best china on the table , flowers in the vases , the fatted chickens roasting in the oven , and Barney 's favourite pudding all ready to be served , with its whipped cream ornamented in professional style with candied cherries and angelica .
Parsing [sent. 4239 len. 12]: `` You must sit still in that easy-chair , poor darling !
Parsing [sent. 4240 len. 27]: _ I 'll _ carve , '' said Theo kindly ; but Philippa felt much more inclined to snap than to be grateful for her consideration .
Parsing [sent. 4241 len. 36]: She hated to be out of her usual place on this evening of all others , and to be obliged to play the part of spectator while Theo issued orders for the prodigal 's reception .
Parsing [sent. 4242 len. 12]: `` Madge , you must chatter as hard as you can .
Parsing [sent. 4243 len. 19]: You are always bragging about your powers of conversation ; now let us see what you can do .
Parsing [sent. 4244 len. 7]: There must be no awkward pauses .
Parsing [sent. 4245 len. 14]: It does n't matter what you say , but say _ something _ .
Parsing [sent. 4246 len. 44]: -- Hope , you had better run to the door and meet him first -- no one could be afraid of _ you _ -- and sit next to Steve at table , and stamp on his toes if he makes improving remarks .
Parsing [sent. 4247 len. 11]: There will be plenty of time for that later on .
Parsing [sent. 4248 len. 8]: We must n't spoil the first evening .
Parsing [sent. 4249 len. 23]: We wo n't let Barney linger over the greetings , but hurry him off to his own room to prepare for dinner .
Parsing [sent. 4250 len. 10]: It shall be served the moment he comes back .
Parsing [sent. 4251 len. 14]: It is so much less formidable to talk when one is eating ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4252 len. 25]: She had thought of everything -- all the little niceties of consideration which Phil herself had planned but had not yet put into words .
Parsing [sent. 4253 len. 42]: She could think of no objection which would have been reasonable to advance , but made a feeble plea to be allowed to be first at the door , when Theo cried loudly , `` My dear , with that face !
Parsing [sent. 4254 len. 12]: You would frighten the poor boy into running away again ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4255 len. 10]: and there was plainly no more to be said .
Parsing [sent. 4256 len. 11]: At six o'clock Barney 's train was due at Waterloo .
Parsing [sent. 4257 len. 40]: It was calculated that he would reach home before the half-hour , and soon after the quarter Theo set the front-door ajar , and the four sisters sat trembling with excitement , straining their ears for the first footstep .
Parsing [sent. 4258 len. 30]: Steve and the Hermit were to bring the boy home from the station , and Philippa thought pitifully of his embarrassment as he sat opposite the two solemn faces .
Parsing [sent. 4259 len. 43]: This home-coming must be an awful ordeal , despite the letters of encouragement and forgiveness which had been sent to Madeira , and again to Southampton , and for her own part she dreaded to see the bright face clouded and ashamed .
Parsing [sent. 4260 len. 25]: The moments passed and no one spoke ; it was half-past six -- twenty-five minutes to seven -- and still Barney did not come .
Parsing [sent. 4261 len. 52]: The invalid shivered and drew her shawl more closely round her ; Theo poked the fire and swept the grate clear of ashes ; Hope was in the act of leaving the room to peer over the banisters , when a sound from below startled all four sisters into instant attention .
Parsing [sent. 4262 len. 35]: It was a sound with which they were all familiar ; perhaps the last sound in the world which they expected to hear at that moment -- a burst of merry , boyish laughter .
Parsing [sent. 4263 len. 4]: `` Bar-ney ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4264 len. 7]: gasped Phil in an incredulous whisper .
Parsing [sent. 4265 len. 21]: The other girls stood like so many statues , frozen into the position in which the sound had reached them .
Parsing [sent. 4266 len. 22]: The leaping footsteps drew nearer and nearer , a voice called out , `` Avast , there , my hearties ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4267 len. 30]: and a big , bronzed fellow threw open the door , and seizing each sister in turn , swung her off her feet in the ardour of his greeting .
Parsing [sent. 4268 len. 36]: Madge 's embrace was every whit as loving as that given to her sisters ; for Barney had forgotten that he had left her in anger , forgotten her bitter words , as , alas !
Parsing [sent. 4269 len. 11]: he seemed to have forgotten his own folly and wrong-doing .
Parsing [sent. 4270 len. 39]: There was no need for Theo 's elaborate precautions ; the truant was as absolutely , transparently at his ease as if he had been out for half-an-hour 's stroll , instead of a voyage across the world .
Parsing [sent. 4271 len. 38]: It was his sisters who sat silent and embarrassed through the meal which followed , while he ate three helpings of chicken and pudding , and discoursed in picturesque fashion on a life on the ocean wave .
Parsing [sent. 4272 len. 58]: Steve , always anxious to improve an occasion , had many questions to ask concerning the distant lands which had been visited ; but though Barney could converse fluently enough on the iniquities of the sailors or the idiosyncrasies of the passengers on whom he had waited , he was but a poor hand at useful information .
Parsing [sent. 4273 len. 32]: What he approved was `` ripping , '' what he disliked was `` tommy rot , '' but these descriptions were hardly satisfactory from a geographic or climatic point of view .
Parsing [sent. 4274 len. 27]: By nine o'clock Philippa was wan and spent , and went off to bed , trying in vain to reason away the ache at her heart .
Parsing [sent. 4275 len. 15]: It was all so different -- so very different from what she had expected !
Parsing [sent. 4276 len. 34]: She did not want to see her boy broken in spirit , but this unabashed assurance frightened her , as indicating a deeper carelessness and lack of moral fibre than she had suspected .
Parsing [sent. 4277 len. 56]: It seemed incredible that Barney should show no sign of regret for the anxiety which he had caused ; yet , on the other hand , what was the sense of writing that bygones were bygones , and all offences forgiven and forgotten , and then of lamenting because she was taken at her word !
Parsing [sent. 4278 len. 44]: Philippa tossed restlessly on her pillow , and being weak and tired , cried steadily from the time she lay down until some one came into the room with her next dose of medicine , and turned up the gas over the mantelpiece .
Parsing [sent. 4279 len. 36]: `` Do n't , Hope , '' she cried weakly ; but it was not Hope , but Barney himself , who raised her head on his arm and held the glass to her lips .
Parsing [sent. 4280 len. 7]: `` Now then , old lady !
Parsing [sent. 4281 len. 23]: I 'm no end of a good nurse nowadays , so I thought I had better come and look after you myself .
Parsing [sent. 4282 len. 18]: There was an old Johnny coming home from the Cape , in one of the deck-cabins . ''
Parsing [sent. 4283 len. 15]: He stopped suddenly , and Philippa knew that he had noticed her tear-stained eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4284 len. 28]: `` He was very bad , and I had to dose him every hour , '' he concluded lamely , then bent over her with curious gaze .
Parsing [sent. 4285 len. 8]: `` What have you been crying about ?
Parsing [sent. 4286 len. 6]: About _ me _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4287 len. 7]: `` I 'm -- not well .
Parsing [sent. 4288 len. 17]: It has upset me seeing you again , and thinking of all that has happened . ''
Parsing [sent. 4289 len. 20]: `` Was it that that made you ill to start with -- my going off , I mean ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4290 len. 54]: It was a curious change of feeling to have taken place in a couple of hours , but Philippa actually found herself wishing that she could answer in the affirmative , and casting about in her mind for some honest reply which would yet lay some burden of responsibility upon those careless shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 4291 len. 24]: `` I have been laid up only a week , but I think I was run down by all the strain and suspense .
Parsing [sent. 4292 len. 18]: We had a terrible fortnight -- '' Barney frowned and drew his hand away from the coverlet .
Parsing [sent. 4293 len. 9]: `` So had I. I was beastly sick .
Parsing [sent. 4294 len. 9]: It is all right , though , Phil .
Parsing [sent. 4295 len. 11]: I 've brought home enough money to pay you back .
Parsing [sent. 4296 len. 7]: I got some rattling good tips .
Parsing [sent. 4297 len. 21]: That old Johnny I told you of -- '' `` Oh Barney , Barney , it was not the money !
Parsing [sent. 4298 len. 29]: I never thought of the money , '' cried Phil , with such a wail of despair as brought the boy 's eyes upon her with startled questioning .
Parsing [sent. 4299 len. 23]: The two faces confronted each other , so like , yet so unlike , and the boy flushed darkly through his tan .
Parsing [sent. 4300 len. 15]: `` Well , you need n't have worried about -- _ that _ either .
Parsing [sent. 4301 len. 7]: I told you I would remember .
Parsing [sent. 4302 len. 13]: I gave my promise , and I -- kept it , Phil .
Parsing [sent. 4303 len. 10]: There were lots of things I wanted to do .
Parsing [sent. 4304 len. 21]: It was awfully dull not being able to go about with the other fellows , but I kept my word .
Parsing [sent. 4305 len. 10]: And I wanted to spend the money , too .
Parsing [sent. 4306 len. 19]: There was the ` cutest little monkey you ever saw , trained to do all sorts of tricks .
Parsing [sent. 4307 len. 32]: It was jolly hard lines not being able to bring it home as a present to you girls , but I thought under the circumstances it might be bad form . ''
Parsing [sent. 4308 len. 7]: `` Oh Barney , Barney ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4309 len. 14]: cried Philippa , laughing uncontrollably even as the tears rolled down her cheeks .
Parsing [sent. 4310 len. 36]: It was such balm in Gilead to know that the promise had been kept ; it was so ridiculously , inimitably like Barney that he should mix up monkeys with the story of his repentance .
Parsing [sent. 4311 len. 33]: `` I 'm so very , very thankful for everything , '' she whispered ; `` for the things you did n't do , and -- the monkey that did n't come .
Parsing [sent. 4312 len. 5]: Kiss me , Barney .
Parsing [sent. 4313 len. 12]: I shall get well quickly now that you are back . ''
Parsing [sent. 4314 len. 47]: Barney did as he was asked , not once , but many times over , and kept his big fingers clasped closely round hers while he asked anxiously : `` You wo n't want to send me back to an office , will you , Phil ?
Parsing [sent. 4315 len. 12]: The Hermit has been telling me about his brother in Canada .
Parsing [sent. 4316 len. 15]: That 's the sort of thing I should like if it could be arranged .
Parsing [sent. 4317 len. 8]: It will be beastly leaving home again .
Parsing [sent. 4318 len. 16]: I never knew it was such a thundering nice place until I left this time .
Parsing [sent. 4319 len. 17]: But it is my only chance ; I should never do any good in the City .
Parsing [sent. 4320 len. 13]: You will let me go , wo n't you , Phil ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4321 len. 10]: `` Yes , Barney , '' said Philippa sadly .
Parsing [sent. 4322 len. 25]: `` It is the hardest thing you could ask me , but if it is for your good I must not think of myself .
Parsing [sent. 4323 len. 37]: You shall go , dear , as soon as an opening is found ; and we will give you as complete an outfit as can be bought , but after that we can do no more .
Parsing [sent. 4324 len. 13]: You will have to stand by yourself and fight your own battles .
Parsing [sent. 4325 len. 30]: There will be no home open if you run away from your work , and no stupid old sister to spoil you and give you a fresh start . ''
Parsing [sent. 4326 len. 26]: The smile with which Barney regarded her was at once charming and pathetic -- so full of warm-hearted affection , so radiantly complacent and assured .
Parsing [sent. 4327 len. 35]: `` Canada is not far off ; it would be as good as being in England , for it is under the old flag , and the people are so jolly loyal and brave .
Parsing [sent. 4328 len. 29]: I could come back every two or three years , and when I get a home of my own you will have to come out and visit me .
Parsing [sent. 4329 len. 28]: Do n't you worry , old girl ; I 'll get on like a house on fire , and I promise you to keep out of mischief .
Parsing [sent. 4330 len. 21]: There will be no chance of getting into it , for one thing , away out in the wilds . ''
Parsing [sent. 4331 len. 12]: `` Oh Barney , Barney , do n't be so sure !
Parsing [sent. 4332 len. 19]: There will be difficulties and temptations wherever you go , and you must be prepared to meet them .
Parsing [sent. 4333 len. 12]: Do n't be content to promise _ me _ , dear .
Parsing [sent. 4334 len. 14]: Promise yourself -- the strong , good man you were meant to be .
Parsing [sent. 4335 len. 16]: Promise God , Barney , and ask Him to help you to stand fast . ''
Parsing [sent. 4336 len. 20]: It was not Philippa 's habit to preach , and the fact gave additional weight to her solemn words .
Parsing [sent. 4337 len. 13]: Barney looked awed and impressed , and thoroughly uncomfortable into the bargain .
Parsing [sent. 4338 len. 30]: `` All right , Phil , I 'll remember , '' he said softly ; but the next moment he discovered that she looked tired , and hurried away .
Parsing [sent. 4339 len. 43]: Philippa heard him go into his own room , and presently the sound of his voice reached her ears , raised in happy strains : `` Jack 's the boy , when girls are sad , To kiss their tears away . ''
Parsing [sent. 4340 len. 45]: He had been serious for five minutes on end , and the strain was evidently too much for his constitution ; but Philippa lay awake far into the night , talking to God about her boy , asking His help where she had failed .
Parsing [sent. 4341 len. 19]: It was the truest of all comforts to feel that the far-off country was still near to Him .
Parsing [sent. 4342 len. 41]: Fortunately for all concerned , the letter from the Hermit 's brother proved in every respect satisfactory , for the Loftus family washed their hands of Barney , going out of their way to refuse help before it was asked .
Parsing [sent. 4343 len. 53]: The ` mannikin ' would , no doubt , have acted differently had he been permitted , but his wife told him sternly that he could not allow _ all _ his friends to be victimised by that dreadful boy , when he said , `` Yes , my dear -- yes !
Parsing [sent. 4344 len. 8]: No , my dear -- no ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4345 len. 8]: and collapsed , as his custom was .
Parsing [sent. 4346 len. 30]: The Charringtons were hardly disappointed , for they had learned long ago that -- except where Hope was concerned -- it was useless to expect sympathy from Aunt Loftus .
Parsing [sent. 4347 len. 45]: Avice 's affection for Hope made her a welcome guest , and she was frequently asked to fill a vacant place at a dinner-table , or presented with a ticket for an afternoon concert which she would not otherwise have been able to afford .
Parsing [sent. 4348 len. 43]: It was at such a concert that Hope 's next meeting with Ralph Merrilies took place , and through all her embarrassment she noticed the glance exchanged between him and Avice as he seated himself in the vacant stall by her side .
Parsing [sent. 4349 len. 26]: There was no surprise in her cousin 's languid eyes , but something very , very like triumph at the completion of a well-laid scheme .
Parsing [sent. 4350 len. 12]: Could it be possible that the seat had been designedly reserved ?
Parsing [sent. 4351 len. 64]: As we all know , well-bred people never dream of whispering or talking at classical concerts , and Hope 's devotion to her programme was so continual and absorbing that her next-door neighbour could study her profile at his ease , and wonder if there was another girl in the world who had such long eyelashes and such a sweet , winsome mouth .
Parsing [sent. 4352 len. 41]: The interval seemed a long time in coming , but it came at last , and then Avice gave Ralph another eloquent glance and carried off her mother to speak to some friends at the other side of the hall .
Parsing [sent. 4353 len. 37]: The occupants of stalls to right and left were also moving about and chattering together , and to the two who were left seated there was a sense of solitude in the midst of a crowd .
Parsing [sent. 4354 len. 7]: `` Was n't it beautiful ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4355 len. 8]: asked Hope , still studying her programme .
Parsing [sent. 4356 len. 4]: `` Very ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4357 len. 13]: replied Ralph ; but they were not referring to the same subject .
Parsing [sent. 4358 len. 22]: He rested his arm on the back of the seat and said softly : `` Never mind that programme just now .
Parsing [sent. 4359 len. 4]: Talk to me .
Parsing [sent. 4360 len. 8]: I have n't seen you for months .
Parsing [sent. 4361 len. 13]: Mrs Loftus told me that you refused her invitation to The Shanty .
Parsing [sent. 4362 len. 10]: I had been hoping to meet you there . ''
Parsing [sent. 4363 len. 28]: `` And I was sorry not to go , but we were in trouble at the time , and I felt I ought to stay at home .
Parsing [sent. 4364 len. 8]: Did you have a good time ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4365 len. 4]: `` Fairly so .
Parsing [sent. 4366 len. 5]: It suffered from contrast .
Parsing [sent. 4367 len. 13]: It was amusing to meet Miss Bennett in her new role . ''
Parsing [sent. 4368 len. 13]: `` I met her a few weeks ago at the Carlton . ''
Parsing [sent. 4369 len. 7]: `` So she told me . ''
Parsing [sent. 4370 len. 18]: There was a meaning expression in his voice which made the blood rush into Hope 's face .
Parsing [sent. 4371 len. 13]: He bent nearer to her , his eyes fixed earnestly on hers .
Parsing [sent. 4372 len. 7]: `` What made you think that ?
Parsing [sent. 4373 len. 16]: What made you imagine for a moment that she could be engaged to met . ''
Parsing [sent. 4374 len. 14]: `` I ca n't tell you , '' replied Hope , truthfully enough .
Parsing [sent. 4375 len. 19]: She stared down at the programme , and became intently occupied in plaiting its cover between her fingers .
Parsing [sent. 4376 len. 26]: `` I knew it was some one whom I had met at The Shanty , and I took for granted that it was you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4377 len. 20]: `` You ca n't truthfully tell me that you thought I was in love with her last year ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4378 len. 4]: `` N-no . ''
Parsing [sent. 4379 len. 17]: `` Did it ever strike you that I was in love with some one else ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4380 len. 15]: The elbow moved its position and encroached on the corner of her own chair .
Parsing [sent. 4381 len. 11]: `` Hope , I want you to answer a question .
Parsing [sent. 4382 len. 31]: Did you refuse to let me call upon you in town because you knew I loved you , and thought it was impossible to care for me in return ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4383 len. 14]: The grey eyes were lifted at that with an air of startled disclaimer .
Parsing [sent. 4384 len. 6]: `` Oh no , no !
Parsing [sent. 4385 len. 5]: Quite the contrary ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4386 len. 4]: cried Hope eagerly .
Parsing [sent. 4387 len. 35]: The next moment confusion seized her as she recognised the inference , but the words were spoken beyond recall , and Ralph 's glowing face showed that he was not likely to forget them .
Parsing [sent. 4388 len. 4]: `` You darling !
Parsing [sent. 4389 len. 7]: Hope , do you mean it ?
Parsing [sent. 4390 len. 11]: Have we been misunderstanding each other all this time ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4391 len. 28]: He stretched his hand towards hen , then hurriedly drew it back as an old lady put up her _ pince-nez _ to regard him from afar .
Parsing [sent. 4392 len. 5]: `` Hang these people !
Parsing [sent. 4393 len. 6]: What a nuisance they are !
Parsing [sent. 4394 len. 9]: I 'll tell you a secret , Hope .
Parsing [sent. 4395 len. 27]: I fell in love with you that very first evening while you were singing your little song , and I 've been uncommonly miserable ever since .
Parsing [sent. 4396 len. 3]: Well ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4397 len. 6]: `` Well -- what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4398 len. 12]: `` One expects some response to a statement like that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4399 len. 8]: Hope gave a soft , contented laugh .
Parsing [sent. 4400 len. 15]: `` I -- liked you too , and I have been _ wretched _ !
Parsing [sent. 4401 len. 8]: What made you come here to-day ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4402 len. 26]: `` Truda told me about your interview , and volunteered the intelligence that you seemed relieved to discover that I was not the happy man .
Parsing [sent. 4403 len. 25]: She spoke to Avice too , I imagine , for I was asked to join you this afternoon in a very marked manner . ''
Parsing [sent. 4404 len. 20]: So Truda had repented her jealous exactions , and had tried to undo the mischief which they had wrought .
Parsing [sent. 4405 len. 25]: That was generous of her , but Hope blushed with a discomfited air as she said : `` I thought I pretended so beautifully !
Parsing [sent. 4406 len. 7]: I thought no one could guess .
Parsing [sent. 4407 len. 9]: There is something else I want to explain .
Parsing [sent. 4408 len. 25]: That evening last winter when you wanted to see me home -- it was not my fault that I disappeared before you came back .
Parsing [sent. 4409 len. 21]: Mrs Welsby asked me to take charge of a little girl , and sent me off in a cab . ''
Parsing [sent. 4410 len. 4]: `` Humph ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4411 len. 7]: exclaimed Mrs Welsby 's brother dryly .
Parsing [sent. 4412 len. 18]: `` What a comfort it would be if people attended to their own business in this world !
Parsing [sent. 4413 len. 7]: And were you sorry , Hope ?
Parsing [sent. 4414 len. 5]: Were you disappointed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4415 len. 46]: `` I cried , '' said Hope simply ; and once again Ralph Merrilies looked round at the other occupants of the stalls and breathed a wish that they were at any other part of the world than just that inhabited by Hope and himself .
Parsing [sent. 4416 len. 31]: At the conclusion of the interval Avice came back to her seat , and looking shyly around , found the answer to her question in two flushed , radiant faces .
Parsing [sent. 4417 len. 9]: `` I 'm so glad , Hope ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4418 len. 16]: she whispered , pressing her cousin 's hand beneath the shelter of that useful programme .
Parsing [sent. 4419 len. 8]: `` It is just what I wanted .
Parsing [sent. 4420 len. 10]: I helped you a little , did n't I ?
Parsing [sent. 4421 len. 7]: I asked him on purpose . ''
Parsing [sent. 4422 len. 16]: `` I shall love you for it all my life , '' said Hope shyly .
Parsing [sent. 4423 len. 21]: `` So shall I , '' said Ralph ; `` but -- why did n't you do it sooner ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4424 len. 42]: Two hours later Hope ascended the stairs leading to the little flat , having dismissed an unwilling lover who had been anxious to introduce himself to his future sisters-in-law and fix the date of his wedding without a moment 's delay .
Parsing [sent. 4425 len. 27]: She tried hard to control her features as she entered the dining-room , and to look less ridiculously happy , but it was of no avail .
Parsing [sent. 4426 len. 27]: The girls gaped at her in astonishment as she stood blushing and smiling before them , and Madge cried severely : `` What is the matter !
Parsing [sent. 4427 len. 10]: You look mightily pleased with yourself , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 4428 len. 13]: What mischief have _ you _ been up to this afternoon ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4429 len. 16]: `` Please , '' said Hope humbly , `` I 've been getting engaged ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4430 len. 11]: and the scene which followed approached delirium in its excitement .
Parsing [sent. 4431 len. 14]: `` And to think that I did not even know his name ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4432 len. 25]: Philippa exclaimed when a hundred questions had been asked and answered , and Hope had been kissed and hugged to her heart 's content .
Parsing [sent. 4433 len. 9]: `` You _ were _ quiet about it !
Parsing [sent. 4434 len. 19]: How did you manage to get along without some one to comfort you all these long months ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4435 len. 21]: `` Theo knew , '' said Hope ; and at that a little frown showed itself on Philippa 's forehead .
Parsing [sent. 4436 len. 44]: It was a blow to her vanity to find that another had been chosen before herself , and though she made no comment , she was filled with a yearning for a closer sympathy and appreciation than she received in the home circle .
Parsing [sent. 4437 len. 35]: `` Sometimes I feel as if I had come to the end of my work , '' she said wistfully to the Hermit when he came upstairs during the evening to congratulate the bride-elect .
Parsing [sent. 4438 len. 25]: `` When Barney goes abroad and Hope marries we shall be a very small family , and Theo is growing so clever at housekeeping .
Parsing [sent. 4439 len. 12]: When I was ill they got on quite well without me .
Parsing [sent. 4440 len. 15]: It seems as if the time had come when I was no longer needed .
Parsing [sent. 4441 len. 8]: It makes me feel quite sad ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4442 len. 7]: `` You must not feel that .
Parsing [sent. 4443 len. 18]: Er -- er -- _ fresh _ duties may arise , '' stammered the Hermit in consolation .
Parsing [sent. 4444 len. 14]: Madge looked at them across the room , and dropped her sagacious chin .
Parsing [sent. 4445 len. 37]: `` At this rate , '' she said to herself -- `` at this precipitate rate -- they will be finding out what they want in the course of the next three or four years ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4446 len. 3]: The End .
