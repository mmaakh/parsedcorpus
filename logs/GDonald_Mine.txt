Parsing [sent. 21 len. 7]: CHAPTER I. HOW COME THEY THERE ?
Parsing [sent. 22 len. 24]: The room was handsomely furnished , but such as I would quarrel with none for calling common , for it certainly was uninteresting .
Parsing [sent. 23 len. 29]: Not a thing in it had to do with genuine individual choice , but merely with the fashion and custom of the class to which its occupiers belonged .
Parsing [sent. 24 len. 63]: It was a dining-room , of good size , appointed with all the things a dining-room `` ought '' to have , mostly new , and entirely expensive -- mirrored sideboard in oak ; heavy chairs , just the dozen , in fawn-coloured morocco seats and backs -- the dining-room , in short , of a London-house inhabited by rich middle-class people .
Parsing [sent. 25 len. 27]: A big fire blazed in the low round-backed grate , whose flashes were reflected in the steel fender and the ugly fire-irons that were never used .
Parsing [sent. 26 len. 36]: A snowy cloth of linen , finer than ordinary , for there was pride in the housekeeping , covered the large dining-table , and a company , evidently a family , was eating its breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 27 len. 7]: But how come these people THERE ?
Parsing [sent. 28 len. 204]: For , supposing my reader one of the company , let him rise from the well-appointed table -- its silver , bright as the complex motions of butler 's elbows can make it ; its china , ornate though not elegant ; its ham , huge , and neither too fat nor too lean ; its game-pie , with nothing to be desired in composition , or in flavour natural or artificial ; -- let him rise from these and go to the left of the two windows , for there are two opposite each other , the room having been enlarged by being built out : if he be such a one as I would have for a reader , might I choose -- a reader whose heart , not merely his eye , mirrors what he sees -- one who not merely beholds the outward shows of things , but catches a glimpse of the soul that looks out of them , whose garment and revelation they are ; -- if he be such , I say , he will stand , for more than a moment , speechless with something akin to that which made the morning stars sing together .
Parsing [sent. 29 len. 18]: He finds himself gazing far over western seas , while yet the sun is in the east .
Parsing [sent. 30 len. 29]: They lie clear and cold , pale and cold , broken with islands scattering thinner to the horizon , which is jagged here and there with yet another .
Parsing [sent. 31 len. 14]: The ocean looks a wild , yet peaceful mingling of lake and land .
Parsing [sent. 32 len. 42]: Some of the islands are green from shore to shore , of low yet broken surface ; others are mere rocks , with a bold front to the sea , one or two of them strange both in form and character .
Parsing [sent. 33 len. 48]: Over the pale blue sea hangs the pale blue sky , flecked with a few cold white clouds that look as if they disowned the earth they had got so high -- though none the less her children , and doomed to descend again to her bosom .
Parsing [sent. 34 len. 39]: A keen little wind is out , crisping the surface of the sea in patches -- a pretty large crisping to be seen from that height , for the window looks over hill above hill to the sea .
Parsing [sent. 35 len. 26]: Life , quiet yet eager , is all about ; the solitude itself is alive , content to be a solitude because it is alive .
Parsing [sent. 36 len. 32]: Its life needs nothing from beyond -- is independent even of the few sails of fishing boats that here and there with their red brown break the blue of the water .
Parsing [sent. 37 len. 78]: If my reader , gently obedient to my thaumaturgy , will now turn and cross to the other window , let him as he does so beware of casting a glance on his right towards the place he has left at the table , for the room will now look to him tenfold commonplace , so that he too will be inclined to ask , `` How come these and their belongings HERE -- just HERE ? ''
Parsing [sent. 38 len. 9]: -- let him first look from the window .
Parsing [sent. 39 len. 48]: There he sees hills of heather rolling away eastward , at middle distance beginning to rise into mountains , and farther yet , on the horizon , showing snow on their crests -- though that may disappear and return several times before settling down for the winter .
Parsing [sent. 40 len. 53]: It is a solemn and very still region -- not a PRETTY country at all , but great -- beautiful with the beauties of colour and variety of surface ; while , far in the distance , where the mountains and the clouds have business together , its aspect rises to grandeur .
Parsing [sent. 41 len. 52]: To his first glance probably not a tree will be discoverable ; the second will fall upon a solitary clump of firs , like a mole on the cheek of one of the hills not far off , a hill steeper than most of them , and green to the top .
Parsing [sent. 42 len. 19]: Is my reader seized with that form of divine longing which wonders what lies over the nearest hill ?
Parsing [sent. 43 len. 35]: Does he fancy , ascending the other side to its crest , some sweet face of highland girl , singing songs of the old centuries while yet there was a people in these wastes ?
Parsing [sent. 44 len. 11]: Why should he imagine in the presence of the actual ?
Parsing [sent. 45 len. 8]: why dream when the eyes can see ?
Parsing [sent. 46 len. 22]: He has but to return to the table to reseat himself by the side of one of the prettiest of girls !
Parsing [sent. 47 len. 26]: She is fair , yet with a glowing tinge under her fairness which flames out only in her eyes , and seldom reddens her skin .
Parsing [sent. 48 len. 25]: She has brown hair with just a suspicion of red and no more , and a waviness that turns to curl at the ends .
Parsing [sent. 49 len. 28]: She has a good forehead , arched a little , not without a look of habitation , though whence that comes it might be hard to say .
Parsing [sent. 50 len. 24]: There are no great clouds on that sky of the face , but there is a soft dimness that might turn to rain .
Parsing [sent. 51 len. 53]: She has a straight nose , not too large for the imperfect yet decidedly Greek contour ; a doubtful , rather straight , thin-lipped mouth , which seems to dissolve into a bewitching smile , and reveals perfect teeth -- and a good deal more to the eyes that can read it .
Parsing [sent. 52 len. 16]: When the mouth smiles , the eyes light up , which is a good sign .
Parsing [sent. 53 len. 27]: Their shape is long oval -- and their colour when unlighted , much that of an unpeeled almond ; when she smiles , they grow red .
Parsing [sent. 54 len. 14]: She has an object in life which can hardly be called a mission .
Parsing [sent. 55 len. 17]: She is rather tall , and quite graceful , though not altogether natural in her movements .
Parsing [sent. 56 len. 18]: Her dress gives a feathery impression to one who rather receives than notes the look of ladies .
Parsing [sent. 57 len. 53]: She has a good hand -- not the doll hand so much admired of those who can judge only of quantity and know nothing of quality , but a fine sensible hand , -- the best thing about her : a hand may be too small just as well as too large .
Parsing [sent. 58 len. 4]: Poor mother earth !
Parsing [sent. 59 len. 29]: what a load of disappointing women , made fit for fine things , and running all to self and show , she carries on her weary old back !
Parsing [sent. 60 len. 9]: From all such , good Lord deliver us !
Parsing [sent. 61 len. 11]: -- except it be for our discipline or their awaking .
Parsing [sent. 62 len. 25]: Near her at the breakfast table sits one of aspect so different , that you could ill believe they belonged to the same family .
Parsing [sent. 63 len. 19]: She is younger and taller -- tall indeed , but not ungraceful , though by no means beautiful .
Parsing [sent. 64 len. 18]: She has all the features that belong to a face -- among them not a good one .
Parsing [sent. 65 len. 2]: Stay !
Parsing [sent. 66 len. 54]: I am wrong : there were in truth , dominant over the rest , TWO good features -- her two eyes , dark as eyes well could be without being all pupil , large , and rather long like her sister 's until she looked at you , and then they opened wide .
Parsing [sent. 67 len. 21]: They did not flash or glow , but were full of the light that tries to see -- questioning eyes .
Parsing [sent. 68 len. 52]: They were simple eyes -- I will not say without arriere pensee , for there was no end of thinking faculty , if not yet thought , behind them , -- but honest eyes that looked at you from the root of eyes , with neither attack nor defence in them .
Parsing [sent. 69 len. 39]: If she was not so graceful as her sister , she was hardly more than a girl , and had a remnant of that curiously lovely mingling of grace and clumsiness which we see in long-legged growing girls .
Parsing [sent. 70 len. 53]: I will give her the advantage of not being further described , except so far as this -- that her hair was long and black , that her complexion was dark , with something of a freckly unevenness , and that her hands were larger and yet better than her sister 's .
Parsing [sent. 71 len. 48]: There is one truth about a plain face , that may not have occurred to many : its ugliness accompanies a condition of larger undevelopment , for all ugliness that is not evil , is undevelopment ; and so implies the larger material and possibility of development .
Parsing [sent. 72 len. 32]: The idea of no countenance is yet carried out , and this kind will take more developing for the completion of its idea , and may result in a greater beauty .
Parsing [sent. 73 len. 76]: I would therefore advise any young man of aspiration in the matter of beauty , to choose a plain woman for wife -- IF THROUGH HER PLAINNESS SHE IS YET LOVELY IN HIS EYES ; for the loveliness is herself , victorious over the plainness , and her face , so far from complete and yet serving her loveliness , has in it room for completion on a grander scale than possibly most handsome faces .
Parsing [sent. 74 len. 34]: In a handsome face one sees the lines of its coming perfection , and has a glimpse of what it must be when finished : few are prophets enough for a plain face .
Parsing [sent. 75 len. 27]: A keen surprise of beauty waits many a man , if he be pure enough to come near the transfiguration of the homely face he loved .
Parsing [sent. 76 len. 15]: This plain face was a solemn one , and the solemnity suited the plainness .
Parsing [sent. 77 len. 33]: It was not specially expressive -- did not look specially intelligent ; there was more of latent than operative power in it -- while her sister 's had more expression than power .
Parsing [sent. 78 len. 14]: Both were lady-like ; whether they were ladies , my reader may determine .
Parsing [sent. 79 len. 22]: There are common ladies and there are rare ladies ; the former MAY be countesses ; the latter MAY be peasants .
Parsing [sent. 80 len. 45]: There were two younger girls at the table , of whom I will say nothing more than that one of them looked awkward , promised to be handsome , and was apparently a good soul ; the other was pretty , and looked pert .
Parsing [sent. 81 len. 37]: The family possessed two young men , but they were not here ; one was a partner in the business from which his father had practically retired ; the other was that day expected from Oxford .
Parsing [sent. 82 len. 38]: The mother , a woman with many autumnal reminders of spring about her , sat at the head of the table , and regarded her queendom with a smile a little set , perhaps , but bright .
Parsing [sent. 83 len. 32]: She had the look of a woman on good terms with her motherhood , with society , with the universe -- yet had scarce a shadow of assumption on her countenance .
Parsing [sent. 84 len. 31]: For if she felt as one who had a claim upon things to go pleasantly with her , had she not put in her claim , and had it acknowledged ?
Parsing [sent. 85 len. 41]: Her smile was a sweet white-toothed smile , true if shallow , and a more than tolerably happy one -- often irradiating THE GOVERNOR opposite -- for so was the head styled by the whole family from mother to chit .
Parsing [sent. 86 len. 23]: He was the only one at the table on whose countenance a shadow -- as of some end unattained -- was visible .
Parsing [sent. 87 len. 28]: He had tried to get into parliament , and had not succeeded ; but I will not presume to say that was the source of the shadow .
Parsing [sent. 88 len. 38]: He did not look discontented , or even peevish ; there was indeed a certain radiance of success about him-only above the cloudy horizon of his thick , dark eyebrows , seemed to hang a thundery atmosphere .
Parsing [sent. 89 len. 27]: His forehead was large , but his features rather small ; he had , however , grown a trifle fat , which tended to make up .
Parsing [sent. 90 len. 17]: In his youth he must have been very nice-looking , probably too pretty to be handsome .
Parsing [sent. 91 len. 32]: In good health and when things went well , as they had mostly done with him , he was sweet-tempered ; what he might be in other conditions was seldom conjectured .
Parsing [sent. 92 len. 15]: But was that a sleeping thunder-cloud , or only the shadow of his eyebrows ?
Parsing [sent. 93 len. 43]: He had a good opinion of himself-on what grounds I do not know ; but he was rich , and I know no better ground ; I doubt if there is any more certain soil for growing a good opinion of oneself .
Parsing [sent. 94 len. 23]: Certainly , the more you try to raise one by doing what is right and worth doing , the less you succeed .
Parsing [sent. 95 len. 36]: Mr. Peregrine Palmer had finished his breakfast , and sat for a while looking at nothing in particular , plunged in deep thought about nothing at all , while the girls went on with theirs .
Parsing [sent. 96 len. 68]: He was a little above the middle height , and looked not much older than his wife ; his black hair had but begun to be touched with silver ; he seemed a man without an atom of care more than humanity counts reasonable ; his speech was not unlike that of an Englishman , for , although born in Glasgow , he had been to Oxford .
Parsing [sent. 97 len. 52]: He spoke respectfully to his wife , and with a pleasant playfulness to his daughters ; his manner was nowise made to order , but natural enough ; his grammar was as good as conversation requires ; everything was respectable about him-and yet-he was one remove at least from a gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 98 len. 12]: Something hard to define was lacking to that idea of perfection .
Parsing [sent. 99 len. 39]: Mr. Peregrine Palmer 's grandfather had begun to make the family fortune by developing a little secret still in a remote highland glen , which had acquired a reputation for its whisky , into a great superterrene distillery .
Parsing [sent. 100 len. 22]: Both he and his son made money by it , and it had `` done well '' for Mr. Peregrine also .
Parsing [sent. 101 len. 17]: With all three of them the making of money had been the great calling of life .
Parsing [sent. 102 len. 22]: They were diligent in business , fervent in spirit , serving Mammon , and founding claim to consideration on the fact .
Parsing [sent. 103 len. 27]: Neither Jacob nor John Palmer 's worst enemy had ever called him a hypocrite : neither had been suspected of thinking to serve Mammon and God .
Parsing [sent. 104 len. 24]: Both had gone regularly to church , but neither had taught in a Sunday school , or once gone to a week-day sermon .
Parsing [sent. 105 len. 9]: Peregrine had built a church and a school .
Parsing [sent. 106 len. 19]: He did not now take any active part in the distillery , but worked mainly in money itself .
Parsing [sent. 107 len. 78]: Jacob , the son of a ship-chandler in Greenock , had never thought about gentleman or no gentleman ; but his son John had entertained the difference , and done his best to make a gentleman of Peregrine ; and neither Peregrine nor any of his family ever doubted his father 's success ; and if he had not quite succeeded , I would have the blame laid on Peregrine and not on either father or grandfather .
Parsing [sent. 108 len. 42]: For a man to GROW a gentleman , it is of great consequence that his grandfather should have been an honest man ; but if a man BE a gentleman , it matters little what his grandfather or grandmother either was .
Parsing [sent. 109 len. 31]: Nay -- if a man be a gentleman , it is of the smallest consequence , except for its own sake , whether the world counts him one or not .
Parsing [sent. 110 len. 27]: Mr. Peregrine Palmer rose from the table with a merry remark on the prolongation of the meal by his girls , and went towards the door .
Parsing [sent. 111 len. 8]: `` Are you going to shoot ? ''
Parsing [sent. 112 len. 4]: asked his wife .
Parsing [sent. 113 len. 4]: `` Not to-day .
Parsing [sent. 114 len. 10]: But I am going to look after my guns .
Parsing [sent. 115 len. 21]: I daresay they 've got them all right , but there 's nothing like seeing to a thing yourself ! ''
Parsing [sent. 116 len. 28]: Mr. Palmer had this virtue , and this very gentlemanlike way -- that he always gave his wife as full an answer as he would another lady .
Parsing [sent. 117 len. 8]: He was not given to marital brevity .
Parsing [sent. 118 len. 17]: He was there for the grouse-shooting -- not exactly , only `` as it were . ''
Parsing [sent. 119 len. 24]: He did not care VERY much about the sport , and had he cared nothing , would have been there all the same .
Parsing [sent. 120 len. 48]: Other people , in what he counted his social position , shot grouse , and he liked to do what other people did , for then he felt all right : if ever he tried the gate of heaven , it would be because other people did .
Parsing [sent. 121 len. 58]: But the primary cause of his being so far in the north was the simple fact that he had had the chance of buying a property very cheap -- a fine property of mist and cloud , heather and rock , mountain and moor , and with no such reputation for grouse as to enhance its price .
Parsing [sent. 122 len. 26]: `` My estate '' sounded well , and after a time of good preserving he would be able to let it well , he trusted .
Parsing [sent. 123 len. 53]: No sooner was it bought than his wife and daughters were eager to visit it ; and the man of business , perceiving it would cost him much less if they passed their autumns there instead of on the continent , proceeded at once to enlarge the house and make it comfortable .
Parsing [sent. 124 len. 24]: If they should never go a second time , it would , with its perfect appointments , make the shooting there more attractive !
Parsing [sent. 125 len. 7]: They had arrived the day before .
Parsing [sent. 126 len. 39]: The journey had been fatiguing , for a great part of it was by road ; but they were all in splendid health , and not too tired to get up at a reasonable hour the next day .
Parsing [sent. 127 len. 3]: CHAPTER II .
Parsing [sent. 128 len. 7]: A SHORT GLANCE OVER THE SHOULDER .
Parsing [sent. 129 len. 20]: Mr. Peregrine was the first of the Palmer family to learn that there was a Palmer coat of arms .
Parsing [sent. 130 len. 11]: He learned it at college , and on this wise .
Parsing [sent. 131 len. 42]: One day a fellow-student , who pleased himself with what he called philology , remarked that his father must have been a hit of a humorist to name him Peregrine : -- `` except indeed it be a family name ! ''
Parsing [sent. 132 len. 3]: he added .
Parsing [sent. 133 len. 11]: `` I never thought about it , '' said Peregrine .
Parsing [sent. 134 len. 11]: `` I do n't quite know what you mean . ''
Parsing [sent. 135 len. 12]: The fact was he had no glimmer of what he meant .
Parsing [sent. 136 len. 9]: `` Nothing profound , '' returned the other .
Parsing [sent. 137 len. 10]: `` Only do n't you see Peregrine means pilgrim ?
Parsing [sent. 138 len. 34]: It is the same as the Italian pellegrino , from the Latin , peregrinus , which means one that goes about the fields , -- what in Scotland you call a LANDLOUPER . ''
Parsing [sent. 139 len. 20]: `` Well , but , '' returned Peregrine , hesitatingly , `` I do n't find myself much wiser .
Parsing [sent. 140 len. 13]: Peregrine means a pilgrim , you say , but what of that ?
Parsing [sent. 141 len. 8]: All names mean something , I suppose !
Parsing [sent. 142 len. 7]: It do n't matter much . ''
Parsing [sent. 143 len. 9]: `` What is your coat of arms ? ''
Parsing [sent. 144 len. 7]: `` I do n't know . ''
Parsing [sent. 145 len. 10]: `` Why did your father call you Peregrine ? ''
Parsing [sent. 146 len. 8]: `` I do n't know that either .
Parsing [sent. 147 len. 9]: I suppose because he liked the name . ''
Parsing [sent. 148 len. 9]: `` Why should he have liked it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 149 len. 12]: continued the other , who was given to the Socratic method .
Parsing [sent. 150 len. 13]: `` I know no more than the man in the moon . ''
Parsing [sent. 151 len. 8]: `` What does your surname mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 152 len. 11]: `` Something to do with palms , I suppose . ''
Parsing [sent. 153 len. 4]: `` Doubtless . ''
Parsing [sent. 154 len. 17]: `` You see I do n't go in for that kind of thing like you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 155 len. 34]: `` Any man who cares about the cut of his coat , might have a little curiosity about the cut of his name : it sits to him a good deal closer ! ''
Parsing [sent. 156 len. 16]: `` That is true -- so close that you ca n't do anything with it .
Parsing [sent. 157 len. 12]: I ca n't pull mine off however you criticize it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 158 len. 8]: `` You can change it any day .
Parsing [sent. 159 len. 8]: Would you like to change it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 160 len. 10]: `` No , thank you , Mr. Stokes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 161 len. 4]: returned Peregrine dryly .
Parsing [sent. 162 len. 13]: `` I did n't mean with mine , '' growled the other .
Parsing [sent. 163 len. 16]: `` My name is an historical one too -- but that is not in question .
Parsing [sent. 164 len. 14]: -- Do you know your crest ought to be a hairy worm ? ''
Parsing [sent. 165 len. 4]: `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 166 len. 8]: `` Do n't you know the palmer-worm ?
Parsing [sent. 167 len. 10]: It got its name where you got yours ! ''
Parsing [sent. 168 len. 10]: `` Well , we all come from Adam ! ''
Parsing [sent. 169 len. 3]: `` What !
Parsing [sent. 170 len. 5]: worms and all ? ''
Parsing [sent. 171 len. 3]: `` Surely .
Parsing [sent. 172 len. 9]: We 're all worms , the parson says .
Parsing [sent. 173 len. 12]: Come , put me through ; it 's time for lunch .
Parsing [sent. 174 len. 12]: Or , if you prefer , let me burst in ignorance .
Parsing [sent. 175 len. 6]: I do n't mind . ''
Parsing [sent. 176 len. 9]: `` Well , then , I will explain .
Parsing [sent. 177 len. 26]: The palmer was a pilgrim : when he came home , he carried a palm-branch to show he had been to the holy land . ''
Parsing [sent. 178 len. 13]: `` Did the hairy worm go to the holy land too ? ''
Parsing [sent. 179 len. 18]: `` He is called a palmer-worm because he has feet enough to go any number of pilgrimages .
Parsing [sent. 180 len. 17]: But you are such a land-louper , you ought to blazon two hairy worms saltier-wise . ''
Parsing [sent. 181 len. 7]: `` I do n't understand . ''
Parsing [sent. 182 len. 18]: `` Why , your name , interpreted to half an ear , is just PILGRIM PILGRIM ! ''
Parsing [sent. 183 len. 10]: `` I wonder if my father meant it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 184 len. 18]: `` That I can not even guess at , not having the pleasure of knowing your father .
Parsing [sent. 185 len. 10]: But it does look like a paternal joke ! ''
Parsing [sent. 186 len. 34]: His friend sought out for him the coat and crest of the Palmers ; but for the latter , strongly recommended a departure : the fresh family-branch would suit the worm so well !
Parsing [sent. 187 len. 18]: -- his crest ought to be two worms crossed , tufted , the tufts ouched in gold .
Parsing [sent. 188 len. 13]: It was not heraldic language , but with Peregrine passed well enough .
Parsing [sent. 189 len. 17]: Still he did not take to the worms , but contented himself with the ordinary crest .
Parsing [sent. 190 len. 26]: He was henceforth , however , better pleased with his name , for he fancied in it something of the dignity of a doubled surname .
Parsing [sent. 191 len. 33]: His first glance at his wife was because she crossed the field of his vision ; his second glance was because of her beauty ; his third because her name was SHELLEY .
Parsing [sent. 192 len. 34]: It is marvellous how whimsically sentimental commonplace people can be where their own interesting personality is concerned : her name he instantly associated with SCALLOP-SHELL , and began to make inquiry about her .
Parsing [sent. 193 len. 21]: Learning that her other name was Miriam , one also of the holy land -- `` A most remarkable coincidence !
Parsing [sent. 194 len. 8]: -- a mere coincidence of course ! ''
Parsing [sent. 195 len. 5]: he said to himself .
Parsing [sent. 196 len. 16]: `` Evidently that is the woman destined to be the companion of my pilgrimage ! ''
Parsing [sent. 197 len. 20]: When their first child was born , the father was greatly exercised as to a fitting name for him .
Parsing [sent. 198 len. 18]: He turned up an old botany book , and sought out the scientific names of different palms .
Parsing [sent. 199 len. 60]: CHAMAEROPS would not do , for it was a dwarf-palm ; BORASSUS might do , seeing it was a boy -- only it stood for a FAN-PALM ; CORYPHA would not be bad for a girl , only it was the name of a heathen goddess , and would not go well with the idea of a holy palmer .
Parsing [sent. 200 len. 28]: COCOA , PHOENIX , and ARECA , one after the other , went in at his eyes and through his head ; none of them pleased him .
Parsing [sent. 201 len. 24]: His wife , however , who in her smiling way had fallen in with his whim , helped him out of his difficulty .
Parsing [sent. 202 len. 36]: She was the daughter of nonconformist parents in Lancashire , and had been encouraged when a child to read a certain old-fashioned book called The Pilgrim 's Progress , which her husband had never seen .
Parsing [sent. 203 len. 17]: He did not read it now , but accepting her suggestion , named the boy Christian .
Parsing [sent. 204 len. 23]: When a daughter came , he would have had her Christiana , but his wife persuaded him to be content with Christina .
Parsing [sent. 205 len. 11]: They named their second son Valentine , after Mr. Valiant-for-truth .
Parsing [sent. 206 len. 20]: Their second daughter was Mercy ; and for the third and fourth , Hope and Grace seemed near enough .
Parsing [sent. 207 len. 29]: So the family had a cool glow of puritanism about it , while nothing was farther from the thoughts of any of them than what their names signified .
Parsing [sent. 208 len. 53]: All , except the mother , associated them with the crusades for the rescue of the sepulchre of the Lord from the pagans ; not a thought did one of them spend on the rescue of a live soul from the sepulchre of low desires , mean thoughts , and crawling selfishness .
Parsing [sent. 209 len. 3]: CHAPTER III .
Parsing [sent. 210 len. 6]: THE GIRLS ' FIRST WALK .
Parsing [sent. 211 len. 78]: The Governor , Peregrine and Palmer as he was , did not care about walking at any time , not even when he HAD to do it because other people did ; the mother , of whom there would have been little left had the sweetness in her moral , and the house-keeping in her practical nature , been subtracted , had things to see to within doors : the young people must go out by themselves !
Parsing [sent. 212 len. 9]: They put on their hats , and issued .
Parsing [sent. 213 len. 43]: The temperature was keen , though it was now nearly the middle of August , by which time in those northern regions the earth has begun to get a little warm : the house stood high , and the atmosphere was thin .
Parsing [sent. 214 len. 29]: There was a certain sense of sadness in the pale sky and its cold brightness ; but these young people felt no cold , and perceived no sadness .
Parsing [sent. 215 len. 25]: The air was exhilarating , and they breathed deep breaths of a pleasure more akin to the spiritual than they were capable of knowing .
Parsing [sent. 216 len. 32]: For as they gazed around them , they thought , like Hamlet 's mother in the presence of her invisible husband , that they saw all there was to be seen .
Parsing [sent. 217 len. 21]: They did not know nature : in the school to which they had gone they patronized instead of revering her .
Parsing [sent. 218 len. 24]: She wrought upon them nevertheless after her own fashion with her children , unheedful whether they knew what she was about or not .
Parsing [sent. 219 len. 33]: The mere space , the mere height from which they looked , the rarity of the air , the soft aspiration of earth towards heaven , made them all more of children .
Parsing [sent. 220 len. 78]: But not one of them being capable of enjoying anything by herself , together they were unable to enjoy much ; and , like the miser who , when he can not much enjoy his money , desires more , began to desire more company to share in the already withering satisfaction of their new possession -- to help them , that is , to get pleasure out of it , as out of a new dress .
Parsing [sent. 221 len. 28]: It is a good thing to desire to share a good thing , but it is not well to be unable alone to enjoy a good thing .
Parsing [sent. 222 len. 12]: It is our enjoyment that should make us desirous to share .
Parsing [sent. 223 len. 15]: What is there to share if the thing be of no value in itself ?
Parsing [sent. 224 len. 10]: To enjoy alone is to be able to share .
Parsing [sent. 225 len. 14]: No participation can make that of value which in itself is of none .
Parsing [sent. 226 len. 29]: It is not love alone but pride also , and often only pride , that leads to the desire for another to be present with us in possession .
Parsing [sent. 227 len. 27]: The girls grew weary of the show around them because it was so quiet , so regardless of their presence , so moveless , so monotonous .
Parsing [sent. 228 len. 32]: Endless change was going on , but it was too slow for them to see ; had it been rapid , its motions were not of a kind to interest them .
Parsing [sent. 229 len. 26]: Ere half an hour they had begun to think with regret of Piccadilly and Regent street -- for they had passed the season in London .
Parsing [sent. 230 len. 12]: There is a good deal counted social which is merely gregarious .
Parsing [sent. 231 len. 33]: Doubtless humanity is better company than a bare hill-side ; but not a little depends on how near we come to the humanity , and how near we come to the hill .
Parsing [sent. 232 len. 89]: I doubt if one who could not enjoy a bare hill-side alone , would enjoy that hill-side in any company ; if he thought he did , I suspect it would be that the company enabled him , not to forget himself in what he saw , but to be more pleasantly aware of himself than the lone hill would permit him to be ; -- for the mere hill has its relation to that true self which the common self is so anxious to avoid and forget .
Parsing [sent. 233 len. 50]: The girls , however , went on and on , led mainly by the animal delight of motion , the two younger making many a diversion up the hill on the one side , and down the hill on the other , shrieking at everything fresh that pleased them .
Parsing [sent. 234 len. 22]: The house they had just left stood on the projecting shoulder of a hill , here and there planted with firs .
Parsing [sent. 235 len. 43]: Of the hardy trees there was a thicket at the back of the house , while toward the south , less hardy ones grew in the shrubbery , though they would never , because of the sea-breezes , come to any height .
Parsing [sent. 236 len. 25]: The carriage-drive to the house joined two not very distant points on the same road , and there was no lodge at either gate .
Parsing [sent. 237 len. 17]: It was a rough , country road , a good deal rutted , and seldom repaired .
Parsing [sent. 238 len. 23]: Opposite the gates rose the steep slope of a heathery hill , along the flank of which the girls were now walking .
Parsing [sent. 239 len. 22]: On their right lay a piece of rough moorland , covered with heather , patches of bracken , and coarse grass .
Parsing [sent. 240 len. 14]: A few yards to the right , it sank in a steep descent .
Parsing [sent. 241 len. 31]: Such was the disposition of the ground for some distance along the road -- on one side the hill , on the other a narrow level , and abrupt descent .
Parsing [sent. 242 len. 43]: As they advanced they caught sight of a ruin rising above the brow of the descent : the two younger darted across the heather toward it ; the two elder continued their walk along the road , gradually descending towards a valley .
Parsing [sent. 243 len. 13]: `` I wonder what we shall see round the corner there ! ''
Parsing [sent. 244 len. 9]: said Mercy , the younger of the two .
Parsing [sent. 245 len. 10]: `` The same over again , I suppose ! ''
Parsing [sent. 246 len. 3]: answered Christina .
Parsing [sent. 247 len. 8]: `` What a rough road it is !
Parsing [sent. 248 len. 9]: I 've twice nearly sprained my ankle ! ''
Parsing [sent. 249 len. 36]: `` I was thinking of what I saw the other day in somebody 's travels -- about his interest in every turn of the road , always looking for what was to come next . ''
Parsing [sent. 250 len. 12]: `` Time enough when it comes , in my opinion ! ''
Parsing [sent. 251 len. 3]: rejoined Christina .
Parsing [sent. 252 len. 30]: For she was like any other mirror -- quite ready to receive what was thrown upon her , but incapable of originating anything , almost incapable of using anything .
Parsing [sent. 253 len. 65]: As they descended , and the hill-side , here covered with bracken and boulders , grew higher and higher above them , the valley , in front and on the right , gradually opened , here and there showing a glimpse of a small stream that cantered steadily toward the sea , now tumbling over a rock , now sullen in a brown pool .
Parsing [sent. 254 len. 25]: Arriving at length at a shoulder of the hill round which the road turned , a whole mile of the brook lay before them .
Parsing [sent. 255 len. 54]: It came down a narrow valley , with scraps of meadow in the bottom ; but immediately below them the valley was of some width , and was good land from side to side , where green oats waved their feathery grace , and the yellow barley was nearly ready for the sickle .
Parsing [sent. 256 len. 17]: No more than the barren hill , however , had the fertile valley anything for them .
Parsing [sent. 257 len. 11]: Their talk was of the last ball they were at .
Parsing [sent. 258 len. 55]: The sisters were about as good friends as such negative creatures could be ; and they would be such friends all their lives , if on the one hand neither of them grew to anything better , and on the other no jealousy , or marked difference of social position through marriage , intervened .
Parsing [sent. 259 len. 34]: They loved each other , if not tenderly , yet with the genuineness of healthy family-habit -- a thing not to be despised , for it keeps the door open for something better .
Parsing [sent. 260 len. 22]: In itself it is not at all to be reckoned upon , for habit is but the merest shadow of reality .
Parsing [sent. 261 len. 22]: Still it is not a small thing , as families go , if sisters and brothers do not dislike each other .
Parsing [sent. 262 len. 16]: They were criticizing certain of the young men they had met at the said ball .
Parsing [sent. 263 len. 25]: Being , in their development , if not in their nature , commonplace , what should they talk about but clothes or young men ?
Parsing [sent. 264 len. 21]: And why , although an excellent type of its kind , should I take the trouble to record their conversation ?
Parsing [sent. 265 len. 47]: To read , it might have amused me -- or even interested , as may a carrot painted by a Dutchman ; but were I a painter , I should be sorry to paint carrots , and the girls ' talk is not for my pen .
Parsing [sent. 266 len. 13]: At the same time I confess myself incapable of doing it justice .
Parsing [sent. 267 len. 45]: When one is annoyed at the sight of things meant to be and not beautiful , there is danger of not giving them even the poor fair-play they stand in so much the more need of that it can do so little for them .
Parsing [sent. 268 len. 10]: But now they changed the subject of their talk .
Parsing [sent. 269 len. 24]: They had come to a point of the road not far from the ruin to which the children had run across the heather .
Parsing [sent. 270 len. 5]: `` Look , Chrissy !
Parsing [sent. 271 len. 7]: It IS an old castle ! ''
Parsing [sent. 272 len. 3]: said Mercy .
Parsing [sent. 273 len. 11]: `` I wonder whether it is on our land ! ''
Parsing [sent. 274 len. 9]: `` Not much to be proud of ! ''
Parsing [sent. 275 len. 4]: replied the other .
Parsing [sent. 276 len. 13]: `` It is nothing but the walls of a square house ! ''
Parsing [sent. 277 len. 8]: `` Not just a common square house !
Parsing [sent. 278 len. 10]: Look at that pepper-pot on one of the corners !
Parsing [sent. 279 len. 14]: -- I wonder how it is all the old castles get deserted ! ''
Parsing [sent. 280 len. 6]: `` Because they are old .
Parsing [sent. 281 len. 12]: It 's well to desert them before they tumble down . ''
Parsing [sent. 282 len. 13]: `` But they would n't tumble down if they were n't neglected .
Parsing [sent. 283 len. 5]: Think of Warwick castle !
Parsing [sent. 284 len. 7]: Stone does n't rot like wood !
Parsing [sent. 285 len. 9]: Just see the thickness of those walls ! ''
Parsing [sent. 286 len. 7]: `` Yes , they are thick !
Parsing [sent. 287 len. 9]: But stone too has its way of rotting .
Parsing [sent. 288 len. 10]: Westminster palace is wearing through , flake by flake .
Parsing [sent. 289 len. 11]: The weather will be at the lords before long . ''
Parsing [sent. 290 len. 13]: `` That 's what Valentine would call a sign of the times .
Parsing [sent. 291 len. 11]: I say , what a radical he is , Chrissy !
Parsing [sent. 292 len. 3]: -- Look !
Parsing [sent. 293 len. 10]: the old place is just like an empty egg-shell !
Parsing [sent. 294 len. 20]: I know , if it had been mine , I would n't have let it come to that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 295 len. 24]: `` You say so because it never was yours : if it had been , you would know how uncomfortable it was ! ''
Parsing [sent. 296 len. 51]: `` I should like to know , '' said Mercy , after a little pause , during which they stood looking at the ruin , `` whether the owners leave such places because they get fastidious and want better , or because they are too poor to keep them up !
Parsing [sent. 297 len. 18]: At all events a man must be poor to SELL the house that belonged to his ancestors !
Parsing [sent. 298 len. 14]: -- It must be miserable to grow poor after being used to plenty !
Parsing [sent. 299 len. 10]: -- I wonder whose is the old place ! ''
Parsing [sent. 300 len. 10]: `` Oh , the governor 's , I suppose !
Parsing [sent. 301 len. 8]: He has all hereabout for miles . ''
Parsing [sent. 302 len. 7]: `` I hope it is ours !
Parsing [sent. 303 len. 9]: I SHOULD like to build it up again !
Parsing [sent. 304 len. 8]: I would live in it myself ! ''
Parsing [sent. 305 len. 16]: `` I 'm afraid the governor wo n't advance your share for that purpose ! ''
Parsing [sent. 306 len. 7]: `` I love old things ! ''
Parsing [sent. 307 len. 3]: said Mercy .
Parsing [sent. 308 len. 15]: `` I believe you take your old doll to bed with you yet ! ''
Parsing [sent. 309 len. 3]: rejoined Christina .
Parsing [sent. 310 len. 8]: `` I am different to you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 311 len. 21]: she continued , with Frenchified grammar ; `` I like things as new as ever I can have them ! ''
Parsing [sent. 312 len. 15]: `` I like new things well enough , Chrissy -- you know I do !
Parsing [sent. 313 len. 4]: It is natural .
Parsing [sent. 314 len. 10]: The earth herself has new clothes once a year .
Parsing [sent. 315 len. 11]: It is but once a year , I grant ! ''
Parsing [sent. 316 len. 11]: `` Often enough for an old granny like her ! ''
Parsing [sent. 317 len. 7]: `` Look what a pretty cottage !
Parsing [sent. 318 len. 9]: -- down there , half-way to the burn !
Parsing [sent. 319 len. 7]: It 's like an English cottage !
Parsing [sent. 320 len. 24]: Those we saw as we came along were either like a piece of the earth , or so white as to look ghastly !
Parsing [sent. 321 len. 14]: This one looks neat and comfortable , and has trees about it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 322 len. 49]: The ruin , once a fortified house and called a castle , stood on a sloping root or spur that ran from the hill down to the bank of the stream , where it stopped abruptly with a steep scaur , at whose foot lay a dark pool .
Parsing [sent. 323 len. 72]: On the same spur , half-way to the burn , stood a low , stone-built , thatched cottage , with a little grove about it , mostly of the hardy , contented , musical fir -- a tree that would seem to have less regard to earthly prosperity than most , and looks like a pilgrim and a stranger : not caring much , it thrives where other trees can not .
Parsing [sent. 324 len. 26]: There might have been a hundred of them , mingled , in strangest contrast , with a few delicate silver birches , about the cottage .
Parsing [sent. 325 len. 27]: It stood toward the east side of the sinking ridge , which had a steep descent , both east and west , to the fields below .
Parsing [sent. 326 len. 15]: The slopes were green with sweet grass , and apparently smooth as a lawn .
Parsing [sent. 327 len. 58]: Not far from where the cottage seemed to rest rather than rise or stand , the burn rushed right against the side of the spur , as if to go straight through it , but turned abruptly , and flowed along the side to the end of it , where its way to the sea was open .
Parsing [sent. 328 len. 45]: On the point of the ridge were a few more firs : except these , those about the cottage , the mole on the hill-cheek , and the plantation about the New House , up or down was not a tree to be seen .
Parsing [sent. 329 len. 8]: The girls stood for a moment looking .
Parsing [sent. 330 len. 8]: `` It 's really quite pretty ! ''
Parsing [sent. 331 len. 5]: said Christina with condescension .
Parsing [sent. 332 len. 18]: `` It has actually something of what one misses here so much -- a certain cosy look !
Parsing [sent. 333 len. 5]: Tidy it is too !
Parsing [sent. 334 len. 20]: As you say , Mercy , it might be in England -- only for the poverty of its trees .
Parsing [sent. 335 len. 9]: -- And oh those wretched bare hills ! ''
Parsing [sent. 336 len. 11]: she added , as she turned away and moved on .
Parsing [sent. 337 len. 22]: `` Wait till the heather is quite out : then you will have colour to make up for the bareness . ''
Parsing [sent. 338 len. 35]: `` Tell true now , Mercy : that you are Scotch need not keep you from speaking the truth : -- do n't you think heather just -- well -- just a leetle magentaish ?
Parsing [sent. 339 len. 9]: -- not a colour to be altogether admired ?
Parsing [sent. 340 len. 11]: -- just a little vulgar , do n't you know ?
Parsing [sent. 341 len. 13]: The fashion has changed so much within the last few years ! ''
Parsing [sent. 342 len. 20]: `` No , I do n't think so ; and if I did I should be ashamed of it .
Parsing [sent. 343 len. 21]: I suppose poor old mother Earth ought to go to the pre-Raphaelites to be taught how to dress herself ! ''
Parsing [sent. 344 len. 16]: Mercy spoke with some warmth , but Christina was not sufficiently interested to be cross .
Parsing [sent. 345 len. 5]: She made no answer .
Parsing [sent. 346 len. 20]: They were now at the part of the road which crossed the descending spur as it left the hill-side .
Parsing [sent. 347 len. 12]: Here they stopped again , and looked down the rocky slope .
Parsing [sent. 348 len. 53]: There was hardly anything green betwixt them and the old ruin -- little but stones on a mass of rock ; but immediately beyond the ruin the green began : there it seemed as if a wave of the meadow had risen and overflowed the spur , leaving its turf behind it .
Parsing [sent. 349 len. 47]: Catching sight of Hope and Grace as they ran about the ruin , they went to join them , the one drawn by a vague interest in the exuviae of vanished life , the other by mere curiosity to see inside the care-worn , protesting walls .
Parsing [sent. 350 len. 51]: Through a gap that might once have been a door , they entered the heart of the sad unhoping thing dropt by the Past on its way to oblivion : nothing looks so unlike life as a dead body , nothing so unfit for human dwelling as a long-forsaken house .
Parsing [sent. 351 len. 34]: Finding in one corner a broken stair , they clambered up to a gap in the east wall ; and as they reached it , heard the sound of a horse 's feet .
Parsing [sent. 352 len. 3]: Looking down .
Parsing [sent. 353 len. 12]: the road , they saw a gig approaching with two men .
Parsing [sent. 354 len. 16]: It had reached a part not so steep , and was coming at a trot .
Parsing [sent. 355 len. 4]: `` Why ! ''
Parsing [sent. 356 len. 8]: exclaimed Christina , `` there 's Val !
Parsing [sent. 357 len. 8]: -- and some one with him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 358 len. 39]: `` I heard the governor say to mamma , '' returned Mercy , `` that Val was going to bring a college friend with him , -- ` for a pop at the grouse , ' he said .
Parsing [sent. 359 len. 9]: I wonder what he will be like ! ''
Parsing [sent. 360 len. 11]: `` He 's a good-big-looking fellow , '' said Christina .
Parsing [sent. 361 len. 4]: They drew nearer .
Parsing [sent. 362 len. 12]: `` You might have said a big , good-looking fellow ! ''
Parsing [sent. 363 len. 3]: rejoined Mercy .
Parsing [sent. 364 len. 6]: `` He really is handsome !
Parsing [sent. 365 len. 15]: -- Now mind , Mercy , I was the first to discover it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 366 len. 3]: said Christina .
Parsing [sent. 367 len. 6]: `` Indeed you were not !
Parsing [sent. 368 len. 12]: -- At least I was the first to SAY it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 369 len. 3]: returned Mercy .
Parsing [sent. 370 len. 21]: `` But you will take him all to yourself anyhow , and I am sure I do n't care ! ''
Parsing [sent. 371 len. 12]: Yet the girls were not vulgar -- they were only common .
Parsing [sent. 372 len. 18]: They did and said vulgar things because they had not the sensitive vitality to shrink from them .
Parsing [sent. 373 len. 23]: They had not been well taught -- that is roused to LIVE : in the family was not a breath of aspiration .
Parsing [sent. 374 len. 13]: There was plenty of ambition , that is , aspiration turned hell-ward .
Parsing [sent. 375 len. 38]: They thought themselves as far from vulgar as any lady in any land , being in this vulgar -- that they despised the people they called vulgar , yet thought much of themselves for not being vulgar .
Parsing [sent. 376 len. 33]: There was little in them the world would call vulgar ; but the world and its ways are vulgar ; its breeding will not pass with the ushers of the high countries .
Parsing [sent. 377 len. 30]: The worst in that of these girls was a FAST , disagreeable way of talking , which they owed to a certain governess they had had for a while .
Parsing [sent. 378 len. 6]: They hastened to the road .
Parsing [sent. 379 len. 5]: The gig came up .
Parsing [sent. 380 len. 22]: Valentine threw the reins to his companion , jumped out , embraced his sisters , and seemed glad to see them .
Parsing [sent. 381 len. 40]: Had he met them after a like interval at home , he would have given them a cooler greeting ; but he had travelled so many miles that they seemed not to have met for quite a long time .
Parsing [sent. 382 len. 18]: `` My friend , Mr. Sercombe , '' he said , jerking his head toward the gig .
Parsing [sent. 383 len. 17]: Mr. Sercombe raised his POT-LID -- the last fashion in head-gear -- and acquaintance was made .
Parsing [sent. 384 len. 15]: `` We 'll drive on , Sercombe , '' said Valentine , jumping up .
Parsing [sent. 385 len. 13]: `` You see , Chris , we 're half dead with hunger !
Parsing [sent. 386 len. 11]: Do you think we shall find anything to eat ? ''
Parsing [sent. 387 len. 36]: `` Judging by what we left at breakfast , '' replied Christina , `` I should say you will find enough for -- one of you ; but you had better go and see . ''
Parsing [sent. 388 len. 3]: CHAPTER IV .
Parsing [sent. 389 len. 6]: THE SHOP IN THE VILLAGE .
Parsing [sent. 390 len. 7]: Two or three days have passed .
Parsing [sent. 391 len. 48]: The sun had been set for an hour , and the night is already rather dark notwithstanding the long twilight of these northern regions , for a blanket of vapour has gathered over the heaven , and a few stray drops have begun to fall from it .
Parsing [sent. 392 len. 34]: A thin wind now and then wakes , and gives a feeble puff , but seems immediately to change its mind and resolve not to blow , but let the rain come down .
Parsing [sent. 393 len. 34]: A drearier-looking spot for human abode it would be difficult to imagine , except it were as much of the sandy Sahara , or of the ashy , sage-covered waste of western America .
Parsing [sent. 394 len. 30]: A muddy road wound through huts of turf -- among them one or two of clay , and one or two of stone , which were more like cottages .
Parsing [sent. 395 len. 18]: Hardly one had a window two feet square , and many of their windows had no glass .
Parsing [sent. 396 len. 21]: In almost all of them the only chimney was little more than a hole in the middle of the thatch .
Parsing [sent. 397 len. 40]: This rendered the absence of glass in the windows not so objectionable ; for , left without ordered path to its outlet , the smoke preferred a circuitous route , and lingered by the way , filling the air .
Parsing [sent. 398 len. 22]: Peat-smoke , however , is both wholesome and pleasant , nor was there mingled with it any disagreeable smell of cooking .
Parsing [sent. 399 len. 31]: Outside were no lamps ; the road was unlighted save by the few rays that here and there crept from a window , casting a doubtful glimmer on the mire .
Parsing [sent. 400 len. 32]: One of the better cottages sent out a little better light , though only from a tallow candle , through the open upper half of a door horizontally divided in two .
Parsing [sent. 401 len. 30]: Except by that same half-door , indeed , little light could enter the place , for its one window was filled with all sorts of little things for sale .
Parsing [sent. 402 len. 24]: Small and inconvenient for the humblest commerce , this was not merely the best , it was the only shop in the hamlet .
Parsing [sent. 403 len. 15]: There were two persons in it , one before and one behind the counter .
Parsing [sent. 404 len. 12]: The latter was a young woman , the former a man .
Parsing [sent. 405 len. 41]: He was leaning over the counter -- whether from weariness , listlessness , or interest in his talk with the girl behind , it would not have been easy , in the dim light and deep shadow , to say .
Parsing [sent. 406 len. 20]: He seemed quite at home , yet the young woman treated him with a marked , though unembarrassed respect .
Parsing [sent. 407 len. 56]: The candle stood to one side of them upon the counter , making a ghastly halo in the damp air ; and in the light puff that occasionally came in at the door , casting the shadow of one of a pair of scales , now on this now on that of the two faces .
Parsing [sent. 408 len. 46]: The young woman was tall and dark , with a large forehead : -- so much could be seen ; but the sweetness of her mouth , the blueness of her eyes , the extreme darkness of her hair , were not to be distinguished .
Parsing [sent. 409 len. 6]: The man also was dark .
Parsing [sent. 410 len. 23]: His coat was of some rough brown material , probably dyed and woven in the village , and his kilt of tartan .
Parsing [sent. 411 len. 17]: They were more than well worn -- looked even in that poor light a little shabby .
Parsing [sent. 412 len. 11]: On his head was the highland bonnet called a glengarry .
Parsing [sent. 413 len. 23]: His profile was remarkable -- hardly less than grand , with a certain aquiline expression , although the nose was not roman .
Parsing [sent. 414 len. 14]: His eyes appeared very dark , but in the daylight were greenish hazel .
Parsing [sent. 415 len. 45]: Usually he talked with the girl in Gaelic , but was now speaking English , a far purer English than that of most English people , though with something of the character of book-English as distinguished from conversation-English , and a very perceptible accent .
Parsing [sent. 416 len. 13]: `` And when was it you heard from Lachlan , Annie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 417 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 418 len. 43]: After a moment 's pause , during which she had been putting away things in a drawer of the counter -- not so big as many a kitchen dresser -- `` Last Thursday it was , sir , '' answered the girl .
Parsing [sent. 419 len. 12]: `` You know we hear every month , sometimes oftener . ''
Parsing [sent. 420 len. 7]: `` Yes ; I know that .
Parsing [sent. 421 len. 10]: -- I hope the dear fellow is well ? ''
Parsing [sent. 422 len. 10]: `` He is quite well and of good hope .
Parsing [sent. 423 len. 12]: He says he will soon come and see us now . ''
Parsing [sent. 424 len. 9]: `` And take you away , Annie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 425 len. 23]: `` Well , sir , '' returned Annie , after a moment 's hesitation , `` he does not SAY so ! ''
Parsing [sent. 426 len. 22]: `` If he did not mean it , he would be a rascal , and I should have to kill him .
Parsing [sent. 427 len. 9]: But my life on Lachlan 's honesty ! ''
Parsing [sent. 428 len. 6]: `` Thank you , sir .
Parsing [sent. 429 len. 9]: He would lay down his for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 430 len. 11]: `` Not if you said to him , DO N'T !
Parsing [sent. 431 len. 6]: - eh , Annie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 432 len. 8]: `` But he would , Macruadh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 433 len. 8]: returned the young woman , almost angrily .
Parsing [sent. 434 len. 8]: `` Are not you his chief ? ''
Parsing [sent. 435 len. 12]: `` Ah , that is all over now , my girl !
Parsing [sent. 436 len. 11]: There are no chiefs , and no clans any more !
Parsing [sent. 437 len. 24]: The chiefs that need not , yet sell their land like Esau for a mess of pottage -- and their brothers with it !
Parsing [sent. 438 len. 24]: And the Sasunnach who buys it , claims rights over them that never grew on the land or were hid in its caves !
Parsing [sent. 439 len. 33]: Thank God , the poor man is not their slave , but he is the worse off , for they will not let him eat , and he has nowhere to go .
Parsing [sent. 440 len. 10]: My heart is like to break for my people .
Parsing [sent. 441 len. 11]: Sometimes I feel as if I would gladly die . ''
Parsing [sent. 442 len. 5]: `` Oh , sir !
Parsing [sent. 443 len. 6]: do n't say that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 444 len. 10]: expostulated the young woman , and her voice trembled .
Parsing [sent. 445 len. 16]: `` Every heart in Glenruadh is glad when it goes well with the Macruadh . ''
Parsing [sent. 446 len. 37]: `` Yes , yes ; I know you all love my father 's son and my uncle 's nephew ; but how can it go well with the Macruadh when it goes ill with his clan ?
Parsing [sent. 447 len. 22]: There is no way now for a chief to be the father of his people ; we are all poor together !
Parsing [sent. 448 len. 8]: My uncle -- God rest his soul !
Parsing [sent. 449 len. 20]: -- they managed it so , I suppose , as to persuade him there was no help for it !
Parsing [sent. 450 len. 19]: Well , a man must be an honest man , even if there be no way but ruin !
Parsing [sent. 451 len. 25]: God knows , as we 've all heard my father say a hundred times from the pulpit , there 's no ruin but dishonesty !
Parsing [sent. 452 len. 17]: For poverty and hard work , he 's a poor creature would crouch for those ! ''
Parsing [sent. 453 len. 14]: `` He who well goes down hill , holds his head up ! ''
Parsing [sent. 454 len. 8]: said Annie , and a pause followed .
Parsing [sent. 455 len. 16]: `` There are strangers at the New House , we hear , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 456 len. 16]: `` From a distance I saw some young ladies , and one or two men .
Parsing [sent. 457 len. 10]: I do n't desire to see more of them .
Parsing [sent. 458 len. 11]: God forbid I should wish them any manner of harm !
Parsing [sent. 459 len. 16]: but -- I hardly understand myself -- I do n't like to see them there .
Parsing [sent. 460 len. 7]: I am afraid it is pride .
Parsing [sent. 461 len. 26]: They are rich , I hear , so we shall not be troubled with attention from them ; they will look down upon us . ''
Parsing [sent. 462 len. 8]: `` Look down on the Macruadh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 463 len. 12]: exclaimed Annie , as if she could not believe her ears .
Parsing [sent. 464 len. 9]: `` Not that I should heed that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 465 len. 4]: he went on .
Parsing [sent. 466 len. 18]: `` A cock on the barn-ridge looks down on you , and you do n't feel offended !
Parsing [sent. 467 len. 10]: What I do dread is looking down on them .
Parsing [sent. 468 len. 16]: There is something in me that can hate , Annie , and I fear it .
Parsing [sent. 469 len. 24]: There is something about the land -- I do n't care about money , but I feel like a miser about the land !
Parsing [sent. 470 len. 67]: -- I do n't mean ANY land ; I should n't care to buy land unless it had once been ours ; but what came down to me from my own people -- with my own people upon it -- I would rather turn the spigot of the molten gold and let it run down the abyss , than a rood of that slip from me !
Parsing [sent. 471 len. 17]: I feel it even a disgrace to have lost what of it I never had ! ''
Parsing [sent. 472 len. 16]: `` Indeed , Macruadh , '' said Annie , `` it 's a hard time !
Parsing [sent. 473 len. 8]: There is no money in the country !
Parsing [sent. 474 len. 10]: And fast the people are going after Lachlan ! ''
Parsing [sent. 475 len. 9]: `` I shall miss you , Annie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 476 len. 12]: `` You are very kind to us all , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 477 len. 8]: `` Are you not all my own !
Parsing [sent. 478 len. 13]: And you have to take care of for Lachlan 's sake besides .
Parsing [sent. 479 len. 25]: He left you solemnly to my charge -- as if that had been necessary , the foolish fellow , when we are foster-brothers ! ''
Parsing [sent. 480 len. 5]: Again came a pause .
Parsing [sent. 481 len. 16]: `` Not a gentleman-farmer left from one end of the strath to the other ! ''
Parsing [sent. 482 len. 6]: said the chief at length .
Parsing [sent. 483 len. 21]: `` When Ian is at home , we feel just like two old turkey-cocks left alone in the yard ! ''
Parsing [sent. 484 len. 16]: `` Say two golden eagles , sir , on the cliff of the rock . ''
Parsing [sent. 485 len. 11]: `` Do n't compare us to the eagle , Annie .
Parsing [sent. 486 len. 7]: I do not love the bird .
Parsing [sent. 487 len. 19]: He is very proud and greedy and cruel , and never will know the hand that tames him .
Parsing [sent. 488 len. 21]: He is the bird of the monarch or the earl , not the bird of the father of his people .
Parsing [sent. 489 len. 13]: But he is beautiful , and I do not kill him . ''
Parsing [sent. 490 len. 12]: `` They shot another , the female bird , last week !
Parsing [sent. 491 len. 6]: All the birds are going !
Parsing [sent. 492 len. 14]: Soon there will be nothing but the great sheep and the little grouse .
Parsing [sent. 493 len. 11]: The capercailzie 's gone , and the ptarmigan 's gone !
Parsing [sent. 494 len. 10]: -- Well , there 's a world beyond ! ''
Parsing [sent. 495 len. 8]: `` Where the birds go , Annie ?
Parsing [sent. 496 len. 7]: -- Well , it may be !
Parsing [sent. 497 len. 30]: But the ptarmigan 's not gone yet , though there are not many ; and for the capercailzie -- only who that loves them will be here to see !
Parsing [sent. 498 len. 18]: -- But do you really think there is a heaven for all God 's creatures , Annie ?
Parsing [sent. 499 len. 4]: Ian does . ''
Parsing [sent. 500 len. 16]: `` I do n't know what I said to make you think so , sir !
Parsing [sent. 501 len. 8]: When the heart aches the tongue mistakes .
Parsing [sent. 502 len. 10]: But how is my lady , your mother ? ''
Parsing [sent. 503 len. 10]: `` Pretty well , thank you -- wonderfully cheerful .
Parsing [sent. 504 len. 9]: It is time I went home to her .
Parsing [sent. 505 len. 20]: Lachlan would think I was playing him false , and making love to you on my own account ! ''
Parsing [sent. 506 len. 4]: `` No fear !
Parsing [sent. 507 len. 7]: He would know better than that !
Parsing [sent. 508 len. 26]: He would know too , if she was not belonging to Lachlan , her father 's daughter would not let her chief humble himself . ''
Parsing [sent. 509 len. 11]: `` You 're one of the old sort , Annie !
Parsing [sent. 510 len. 3]: Good night .
Parsing [sent. 511 len. 21]: Mind you tell Lachlan I never miss a chance of looking in to see how you are getting on . ''
Parsing [sent. 512 len. 4]: `` I will .
Parsing [sent. 513 len. 6]: Good night , Macruadh . ''
Parsing [sent. 514 len. 15]: They shook hands over the counter , and the young chief took his departure .
Parsing [sent. 515 len. 23]: As he stood up , he showed a fine-made , powerful frame , over six feet in height , and perfectly poised .
Parsing [sent. 516 len. 42]: With a great easy stride he swept silently out of the shop ; nor from gait any more than look would one have thought he had been all day at work on the remnant of property he could call his own .
Parsing [sent. 517 len. 87]: To a cit it would have seemed strange that one sprung from innumerable patriarchal ancestors holding the land of the country , should talk so familiarly with a girl in a miserable little shop in a most miserable hamlet ; it would have seemed stranger yet that such a one should toil at the labour the soul of a cit despises ; but stranger than both it would seem to him , if he saw how such a man is tempted to look down upon HIM .
Parsing [sent. 518 len. 17]: If less CLEVERNESS is required for country affairs , they leave the more room for thinking .
Parsing [sent. 519 len. 34]: There are great and small in every class ; here and there is a ploughman that understands Burns , here and there a large-minded shopkeeper , here and there perhaps an unselfish duke .
Parsing [sent. 520 len. 51]: Doubtless most of the youth 's ancestors would likewise have held such labour unworthy of a gentleman , and would have preferred driving to their hills a herd of lowland cattle ; but this , the last Macruadh , had now and then a peep into the kingdom of heaven .
Parsing [sent. 521 len. 3]: CHAPTER V .
Parsing [sent. 522 len. 3]: THE CHIEF .
Parsing [sent. 523 len. 31]: The Macruadh strode into the dark , and down the village , wasting no time in picking his way -- thence into the yet deeper dark of the moorland hills .
Parsing [sent. 524 len. 26]: The rain was beginning to come down in earnest , but he did not heed it ; he was thoroughbred , and feared no element .
Parsing [sent. 525 len. 32]: An umbrella was to him a ludicrous thing : how could a little rain -- as he would have called it had it come down in torrents -- hurt any one !
Parsing [sent. 526 len. 67]: The Macruadh , as the few who yet held by the sore-frayed , fast-vanishing skirt of clanship , called him , was the son of the last minister of the parish-a godly man , who lived that which he could ill explain , and was immeasurably better than those parts of his creed which , from a sense of duty , he pushed to the front .
Parsing [sent. 527 len. 30]: For he held devoutly by the root of which he spoke too little , and it supplied much sap to his life and teaching -- out of the pulpit .
Parsing [sent. 528 len. 43]: He was a genial , friendly , and by nature even merry man , always ready to share what he had , and making no show of having what he had not , either in wisdom , knowledge , or earthly goods .
Parsing [sent. 529 len. 36]: His father and brother had been owners of the property and chiefs of the clan , much beloved by the poor of it , and not a little misunderstood by most of the more nourishing .
Parsing [sent. 530 len. 29]: For a great hunger after larger means , the ambition of the mammon-ruled world , had arisen in the land , and with it a rage for emigration .
Parsing [sent. 531 len. 84]: The uncle of the present Macruadh did all he could to keep his people at home , lived on a couple of hundreds a year himself , and let many of his farms to his gentlemen-tacksmen , as they were called , at lower rents ; but it was unavailing ; one after another departed , until his land lay in a measure waste , and he grew very poor , mourning far more over his clan and his country than his poverty .
Parsing [sent. 532 len. 71]: In more prosperous times he had scraped together a little money , meaning it , if he could but avoid spending it in his old age , for his brother , who must soon succeed him ; for he was himself a bachelor -- the result of a romantic attachment and sorrow in his youth ; but he lent it to a company which failed , and so lost it .
Parsing [sent. 533 len. 26]: At length he believed himself compelled , for the good of his people , to part with all but a mere remnant of the property .
Parsing [sent. 534 len. 26]: From the man to whom he sold it , Mr. Peregrine Palmer bought it for twice the money , and had still a good bargain .
Parsing [sent. 535 len. 62]: But the hopes of the laird were disappointed : in the sheep it fed , and the grouse it might be brought to breed , lay all its value in the market ; there was no increase in the demand for labour ; and more and more of the peasantry emigrated , or were driven to other parts of the country .
Parsing [sent. 536 len. 26]: Such was the present treatment of the land , causing human life to ebb from it , and working directly counter to the creative God .
Parsing [sent. 537 len. 64]: The laird retired to the humble cottage of his brother the pastor , just married rather late in life -- where every comfort love could give waited for him ; but the thought that he could have done better for his people by retaining the land soon wore him out ; and having made a certain disposition of the purchase-money , he died .
Parsing [sent. 538 len. 10]: What remained of the property came to the minister .
Parsing [sent. 539 len. 33]: As for the chieftainship , that had almost died before the chief ; but , reviving by union with the reverence felt for the minister , it took thereafter a higher form .
Parsing [sent. 540 len. 49]: When the minister died , the idea of it transmitted to his son was of a peculiarly sacred character ; while in the eyes of the people , the authority of the chief and the influence of the minister seemed to meet reborn in Alister notwithstanding his youth .
Parsing [sent. 541 len. 38]: In himself he was much beloved , and in love the blessed rule , blessed where understood , holds , that to him that hath shall be given , he only who has being fit to receive .
Parsing [sent. 542 len. 21]: The love the people bore to his father , both pastor and chief , crowned head and heart of Alister .
Parsing [sent. 543 len. 18]: Scarce man or woman of the poor remnant of the clan did not love the young Macruadh .
Parsing [sent. 544 len. 7]: On his side was true response .
Parsing [sent. 545 len. 53]: With a renewed and renovating conscience , and a vivid sense that all things had to be made new , he possessed an old strong heart , clinging first to his father and mother , and then to the shadow even of any good thing that had come floating down the ages .
Parsing [sent. 546 len. 106]: Call it a dream , a wild ideal , a foolish fancy -- call it what you please , he was filled with the notion of doing something in his own person and family , having the remnant of the clan for the nucleus of his endeavour , to restore to a vital reality , let it be of smallest extent , that most ancient of governments , the patriarchal , which , all around , had rotted into the feudal , in its turn rapidly disintegrating into the mere dust and ashes of the kingdom of the dead , over which Mammon reigns supreme .
Parsing [sent. 547 len. 65]: There may have been youthful presumption and some folly in the notion , but it sprang neither from presumption nor folly , but from simple humanity , and his sense of the responsibility he neither could nor would avoid , as the person upon whom had devolved the headship , however shadowy , of a house , ruinous indeed , but not yet razed .
Parsing [sent. 548 len. 13]: The castle on the ridge stood the symbol of the family condition .
Parsing [sent. 549 len. 17]: It had , however , been a ruin much longer than any one alive could remember .
Parsing [sent. 550 len. 38]: Alister 's uncle had lived in a house on the spot where Mr. Peregrine Palmer 's now stood ; the man who bought it had pulled it down to build that which Mr. Palmer had since enlarged .
Parsing [sent. 551 len. 51]: It was but a humble affair -- a great cottage in stone , much in the style of that in which the young chief now lived -- only six times the size , with the one feature indispensable to the notion of a chief 's residence , a large hall .
Parsing [sent. 552 len. 28]: Some would say it was but a huge kitchen ; but it was the sacred place of the house , in which served the angel of hospitality .
Parsing [sent. 553 len. 34]: THERE was always plenty to eat and drink for any comer , whether he had `` claim '' or not : the question of claim where was need , was not thought of .
Parsing [sent. 554 len. 54]: When the old house had to make room for the new , the staves of the last of its half-pipes of claret , one of which used always to stand on tap amidst the peat-smoke , yielded its final ministration to humanity by serving to cook a few meals for mason and carpenter .
Parsing [sent. 555 len. 77]: The property of Clanruadh , for it was regarded as clan-property BECAUSE belonging to the chief , stretched in old time away out of sight in all directions -- nobody , in several , could tell exactly how far , for the undrawn boundary lines lay in regions of mist and cloud , in regions stony , rocky , desert , to which a red deer , not to say a stray sheep , rarely ascended .
Parsing [sent. 556 len. 24]: At one time it took in a portion at least of every hill to be seen from the spot where stood the ruin .
Parsing [sent. 557 len. 91]: The chief had now but a small farm , consisting of some fair soil on the slope of a hill , and some very good in the valley on both sides of the burn ; with a hill-pasture that was not worth measuring in acres , for it abounded in rocks , and was prolific in heather and ling , with patches of coarse grass here and there , and some extent of good high-valley grass , to which the small black cattle and black-faced sheep were driven in summer .
Parsing [sent. 558 len. 32]: Beyond periodical burnings of the heather , this uplifted portion received no attention save from the mist , the snow , the rain , the sun , and the sweet air .
Parsing [sent. 559 len. 24]: A few grouse and black game bred on it , and many mountain-hares , with martens , wild cats , and other VERMIN .
Parsing [sent. 560 len. 67]: But so tender of life was the Macruadh that , though he did not spare these last , he did not like killing even a fox or a hooded crow , and never shot a bird for sport , or would let another shoot one , though the poorest would now and then beg a bird or two from him , sure of having their request .
Parsing [sent. 561 len. 29]: It seemed to him as if the creatures were almost a part of his clan , of which also he had to take care against a greedy world .
Parsing [sent. 562 len. 47]: But as the deer and the birds ranged where they would , it was not much he could do for them -- as little almost as for the men and women that had gone over the sea , and were lost to their country in Canada .
Parsing [sent. 563 len. 28]: Regret , and not any murmur , stirred the mind of Alister Macruadh when he thought of the change that had passed on all things around him .
Parsing [sent. 564 len. 37]: He had been too well taught for grumbling -- least of all at what was plainly the will of the Supreme -- inasmuch as , however man might be to blame , the thing was there .
Parsing [sent. 565 len. 14]: Personal regrets he had none beyond those of family feeling and transmitted SENTIMENT .
Parsing [sent. 566 len. 118]: He was able to understand something of the signs of the times , and saw that nothing could bring back the old way -- saw that nothing comes back -- at least in the same form ; saw that there had been much that ought not to come back , and that , if patriarchal ways were ever to return , they must rise out of , and be administered upon loftier principles -- must begin afresh , and be wrought out afresh from the bosom of a new Abraham , capable of so bringing up his children that a new development of the one natural system , of government should be possible with and through them .
Parsing [sent. 567 len. 54]: Perhaps even now , in the new country to which so many of his people were gone , some shadowy reappearance of the old fashion might have begun to take shape on a higher level , with loftier aims , and in circumstances holding out fewer temptations to the evils of the past !
Parsing [sent. 568 len. 69]: Alister could not , at his years , have generated such thoughts but for the wisdom that had gone before him -- first the large-minded speculation of his father , who was capable even of discarding his prejudices where he saw they might mislead him ; and next , the response of his mother to the same : she was the only one who entirely understood her husband .
Parsing [sent. 569 len. 9]: Isobel Macruadh was a woman of real thinking-power .
Parsing [sent. 570 len. 60]: Her sons being but boys when their father died , she at once took the part of mediator between the mind of the father and that of his sons ; and besides guiding them on the same principles , often told them things their father had said , and talked with them of things they had heard him say .
Parsing [sent. 571 len. 71]: One of the chief lessons he left them wrought well for the casting out of all with which the feudal system had debased the patriarchal ; and the poverty shared with the clan had powerfully helped : it was spoken against the growing talionic regard of human relations -- that , namely , the conditions of a bargain fulfilled on both sides , all is fulfilled between the bargaining parties .
Parsing [sent. 572 len. 27]: `` In the possibility of any bargain , '' he had said , `` are involved eternal conditions : there is relationship -- there is brotherhood .
Parsing [sent. 573 len. 31]: Even to give with a denial of claim , to be kind under protest , is an injury , is charity without the love , is salt without the saltness .
Parsing [sent. 574 len. 26]: If we spent our lives in charity we should never overtake neglected claims -- claims neglected from the very beginning of the relations of men .
Parsing [sent. 575 len. 39]: If a man say , ' I have not been unjust ; I owed the man nothing ; ' he sides with Death -- says with the typical murderer , ` Am I my brother 's keeper ? '
Parsing [sent. 576 len. 10]: builds the tombs of those his fathers slew . ''
Parsing [sent. 577 len. 36]: In the bosom of young Alister Macruadh , the fatherly relation of the strong to the weak survived the disappearance of most of the outward signs of clan-kindred : the chieftainship was SUBLIMED in him .
Parsing [sent. 578 len. 20]: The more the body of outer fact died , the stronger grew in him the spirit of the relation .
Parsing [sent. 579 len. 53]: As some savage element of a race will reappear in an individual of it after ages of civilization , so may good old ways of thinking and feeling , modes long gone out of fashion and practice , survive and revive modified by circumstance , in an individual of a new age .
Parsing [sent. 580 len. 54]: Such a one will see the customs of his ancestors glorified in the mists of the past ; what is noble in them will appeal to all that is best in his nature , spurring the most generous of his impulses , and stirring up the conscience that would be void of offence .
Parsing [sent. 581 len. 72]: When the operative force of such regards has been fostered by the teaching of a revered parent ; when the influences he has left behind are nourished and tended , with thorough belief and devoted care , by her who shared his authority in life , and now bears alone the family sceptre , there can be no bound set to their possible potency in a mind of high spiritual order .
Parsing [sent. 582 len. 48]: The primary impulse became with Alister a large portion of his religion : he was the shepherd of the much ravaged and dwindled Macruadh-fold ; it was his church , in which the love of the neighbour was intensified in the love of the relation and dependent .
Parsing [sent. 583 len. 14]: To aid and guard this his flock , was Alister 's divine service .
Parsing [sent. 584 len. 30]: It was associated with a great dislike of dogma , originating in the recoil of the truth within him from much that was commonly held and taught for true .
Parsing [sent. 585 len. 18]: Call the thing enthusiasm or what you will , so you believe it there , and genuine .
Parsing [sent. 586 len. 51]: It was only towards the poor of a decayed clan he had opportunity of exercising the cherished relation ; almost all who were not poor had emigrated before the lands were sold ; and indeed it was only the poor who set store by their unity with the old head .
Parsing [sent. 587 len. 40]: Not a few of the clan , removed elsewhither , would have smiled degenerate , and with scorn in their amusement , at the idea of Alister 's clinging to any supposed reality in the position he could claim .
Parsing [sent. 588 len. 40]: Among such nevertheless were several who , having made money by trade , would each have been glad enough to keep up old traditions , and been ready even to revive older , had the headship fallen to him .
Parsing [sent. 589 len. 76]: But in the hands of a man whom , from the top of their wealth , they regarded as but a poor farmer , they forgot all about it -- along with a few other more important and older-world matters ; for where Mammon gets in his foot , he will soon be lord of the house , and turn not merely Rank , his rival demon , out of doors , but God himself .
Parsing [sent. 590 len. 63]: Alister indeed lived in a dream ; he did not know how far the sea of hearts had ebbed , leaving him alone on the mount of his vision ; but he dreamed a dream that was worth dreaming ; comfort and help flowed from it to those about him , nor did it fail to yield his own soul refreshment also .
Parsing [sent. 591 len. 15]: All dreams are not false ; some dreams are truer than the plainest facts .
Parsing [sent. 592 len. 23]: Fact at best is but a garment of truth , which has ten thousand changes of raiment woven in the same loom .
Parsing [sent. 593 len. 36]: Let the dreamer only do the truth of his dream , and one day he will realize all that was worth realizing in it -- and a great deal more and better than it contained .
Parsing [sent. 594 len. 42]: Alister had no far-reaching visions of anything to come out of his ; he had , like the true man he was , only the desire to live up to his idea of what the people looked up to in him .
Parsing [sent. 595 len. 24]: The one thing that troubled him was , that his uncle , whom he loved so dearly , should have sold the land .
Parsing [sent. 596 len. 16]: Doubtless there was pride mingled with his devotion , and pride is an evil thing .
Parsing [sent. 597 len. 11]: Still it was a human and not a devilish pride .
Parsing [sent. 598 len. 83]: I would not be misunderstood as defending pride , or even excusing it in any shape ; it is a thing that must be got rid of at all costs ; but even for evil we must speak the truth ; and the pride of a good man , evil as it is , and in him more evil than in an evil man , yet can not be in itself such a bad thing as the pride of a bad man .
Parsing [sent. 599 len. 16]: The good man would at once recognize and reject the pride of a bad man .
Parsing [sent. 600 len. 15]: A pride that loves can not be so bad as a pride that hates .
Parsing [sent. 601 len. 38]: Yet if the good man do not cast out his pride , it will sink him lower than the bad man 's , for it will degenerate into a worse pride than that of any bad man .
Parsing [sent. 602 len. 8]: Each must bring its own divinely-ordained consequence .
Parsing [sent. 603 len. 67]: There is one other point in the character of the Macruadh which I must mention ere I pass on ; in this region , and at this time , it was a great peculiarity , one that yielded satisfaction to few of the clan , and made him even despised in the strath : he hated whisky , and all the drinking customs associated with it .
Parsing [sent. 604 len. 64]: In this he was not original ; he had not come to hate it from noting the degradation and crime that attended it , or that as poverty grew , drunkenness grew , men who had used it in moderation taking more and more as circumstances became more adverse , turning sadness into slavery : he had been brought up to hate it .
Parsing [sent. 605 len. 81]: His father , who , as a clergyman doing his endeavour for the welfare of his flock , found himself greatly thwarted by its deadening influences , rendering men callous not only to the special vice itself , but to worse vices as well , had banished it from his table and his house ; while the mother had from their very childhood instilled a loathing of the national weakness and its physical means into the minds of her sons .
Parsing [sent. 606 len. 33]: In her childhood she had seen its evils in her own father : by no means a drunkard , he was the less of a father because he did as others did .
Parsing [sent. 607 len. 30]: Never an evening passed without his drinking his stated portion of whisky-toddy , growing more and more subject to attacks of had temper , with consequent injustice and unkindness .
Parsing [sent. 608 len. 40]: The recollection may have made her too sweeping in her condemnation of the habit , but I doubt it ; and anyhow a habit is not a man , and we need not much condemn that kind of injustice .
Parsing [sent. 609 len. 25]: We need not be tender over a habit which , though not all bad , yet leads to endless results that are all bad .
Parsing [sent. 610 len. 11]: I would follow such to its grave without many tears !
Parsing [sent. 611 len. 33]: Isobel Macruadh was one of those rare women who preserve in years the influence gained in youth ; and the thing that lay at the root of the fact was her justice .
Parsing [sent. 612 len. 40]: For though her highland temper would occasionally burst out in hot flame , everyone knew that if she were in the wrong , she would see it and say it before any one else would tell her of it .
Parsing [sent. 613 len. 26]: This justice it was , ready against herself as for another , that fixed the influence which her goodness and her teaching of righteousness gained .
Parsing [sent. 614 len. 11]: Her eldest child , a girl , died in infancy .
Parsing [sent. 615 len. 14]: Alister and Ian were her whole earthly family , and they worshipped her .
Parsing [sent. 616 len. 3]: CHAPTER VI .
Parsing [sent. 617 len. 4]: WORK AND WAGE .
Parsing [sent. 618 len. 21]: Alister strode through the night , revolving no questions hard to solve , though such were not strangers to him .
Parsing [sent. 619 len. 28]: He had not been to a university like his brother , but he had had a good educational beginning -- who ever had more than a beginning ?
Parsing [sent. 620 len. 81]: -- chiefly from his father , who for his time and opportunity was even a learned man -- and better , a man who knew what things were worth a man 's human while , and what were not : he could and did think about things that a man must think about or perish ; and his son Alister had made himself able to think about what he did not know , by doing the thing he did know .
Parsing [sent. 621 len. 51]: But now , as he walked , fighting with the wind , his bonnet of little shelter pulled down on his forehead , he was thinking mostly of Lachlan his foster-brother , whose devotion had done much to nourish in him the sense that he was head of the clan .
Parsing [sent. 622 len. 17]: He had not far to go to reach his home -- about a couple of miles .
Parsing [sent. 623 len. 26]: He had left the village a quarter of the way behind him , when through the darkness he spied something darker yet by the roadside .
Parsing [sent. 624 len. 42]: Going up to it , he found an old woman , half sitting , half standing , with a load of peats in a creel upon her back , unable , apparently , for the moment at least , to proceed .
Parsing [sent. 625 len. 13]: Alister knew at once by her shape and posture who she was .
Parsing [sent. 626 len. 7]: `` Ah , mistress Conal ! ''
Parsing [sent. 627 len. 21]: he said , `` I am sorry to see you resting on such a night so near your own door .
Parsing [sent. 628 len. 17]: It means you have filled your creel too full , and tired yourself too much . ''
Parsing [sent. 629 len. 11]: `` I am not too much tired , Macruadh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 630 len. 28]: returned the old woman , who was proud and cross-tempered , and had a reputation for witchcraft , which did her neither much good nor much harm .
Parsing [sent. 631 len. 21]: `` Well , whether you are tired or not , I believe I am the stronger of the two ! ''
Parsing [sent. 632 len. 9]: `` Small doubt of that , Alister ! ''
Parsing [sent. 633 len. 7]: said mistress Conal with a sigh .
Parsing [sent. 634 len. 15]: `` Then I will take your creel , and you will soon be home .
Parsing [sent. 635 len. 3]: Come along !
Parsing [sent. 636 len. 10]: It is going to be a wild night ! ''
Parsing [sent. 637 len. 28]: So saying he took the rope from the neck of the old woman right gently , and threw the creel with a strong swing over his shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 638 len. 23]: This dislodged a few of the topmost of the peats which the poor old thing had been a long way to fetch .
Parsing [sent. 639 len. 13]: She heard them fall , and one of them struck her foot .
Parsing [sent. 640 len. 9]: She started up , almost in a rage .
Parsing [sent. 641 len. 3]: `` Sir !
Parsing [sent. 642 len. 2]: sir !
Parsing [sent. 643 len. 4]: my peats ! ''
Parsing [sent. 644 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 645 len. 24]: `` What would you be throwing away the good peats into the dark for , letting that swallow them they should swallow ! ''
Parsing [sent. 646 len. 80]: These words , as all that passed between them , were spoken neither in Scotch nor English , but in Gaelic -- which , were I able to write it down , most of my readers would no more understand than they would Phoenician : we must therefore content ourselves with what their conversation comes to in English , which , if deficient compared with Gaelic in vowel-sounds , yet serves to say most things capable of being said .
Parsing [sent. 647 len. 34]: `` I am sorry , mistress Conal ; but we 'll not be losing them , '' returned the laird gently , and began to feel about the road for the fallen peats .
Parsing [sent. 648 len. 16]: `` How many were there , do you think , of them that fell ? ''
Parsing [sent. 649 len. 9]: he asked , rising after a vain search .
Parsing [sent. 650 len. 7]: `` How should I be knowing !
Parsing [sent. 651 len. 13]: But I am sure there would be nigh six of them ! ''
Parsing [sent. 652 len. 36]: answered the woman , in a tone of deep annoyance -- nor was it much wonder ; they were precious to the cold , feeble age that had gone so far to fetch so few .
Parsing [sent. 653 len. 20]: The laird again stooped his long back , and searched and searched , feeling on all sides around him .
Parsing [sent. 654 len. 5]: He picked up three .
Parsing [sent. 655 len. 13]: Not another , after searching for several minutes , could he find .
Parsing [sent. 656 len. 18]: `` I 'm thinking that must be all of them , but I find only three ! ''
Parsing [sent. 657 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 658 len. 8]: `` Come , let us go home !
Parsing [sent. 659 len. 17]: You must not make your cough worse for one or two peats , perhaps none ! ''
Parsing [sent. 660 len. 8]: `` Three , Macruadh , three ! ''
Parsing [sent. 661 len. 31]: insisted the old woman in wavering voice , broken by coughing ; for , having once guessed six , she was not inclined to lower her idea of her having .
Parsing [sent. 662 len. 5]: `` Well , well !
Parsing [sent. 663 len. 10]: we 'll count them when we get home ! ''
Parsing [sent. 664 len. 14]: said Alister , and gave his hand to her to help her up .
Parsing [sent. 665 len. 27]: She yielded grumbling , and , bowed still though relieved from her burden , tottered by his side along the dark , muddy , wind-and-rain-haunted road .
Parsing [sent. 666 len. 12]: `` Did you see my niece to-night at the shop ? ''
Parsing [sent. 667 len. 22]: she asked ; for she was proud of being so nearly related to those who kept the shop of the hamlet .
Parsing [sent. 668 len. 20]: `` That I did , '' answered the chief ; and a little talk followed about Lachlan in Canada .
Parsing [sent. 669 len. 53]: No one could have perceived from the way in which the old woman accepted his service , and the tone in which she spoke to him while he bent under her burden , that she no less than loved her chief ; but everybody only smiled at mistress Conal 's rough speech .
Parsing [sent. 670 len. 25]: That night , ere she went to bed , she prayed for the Macruadh as she never prayed for one of her immediate family .
Parsing [sent. 671 len. 47]: And if there was a good deal of superstition mingled with her prayer , the main thing in it was genuine , that is , the love that prompted it ; and if God heard only perfect prayers , how could he be the prayer-hearing God ?
Parsing [sent. 672 len. 26]: Her dwelling stood but a stone 's - throw from the road , and presently they turned up to it by a short steep ascent .
Parsing [sent. 673 len. 31]: It was a poor hut , mostly built of turf ; but turf makes warm walls , impervious to the wind , and it was a place of her own !
Parsing [sent. 674 len. 38]: -- that is , she had it to herself , a luxury many can not even imagine , while to others to he able to be alone at will seems one of the original necessities of life .
Parsing [sent. 675 len. 122]: Even the Lord , who probably had not always a room to himself in the poor houses he staid at , could not do without solitude ; therefore not unfrequently spent the night in the open air , on the quiet , star-served hill : there even for him it would seem to have been easier to find an entrance into that deeper solitude which , it is true , he did not need in order to find his Father and his God , but which apparently he did need in order to come into closest contact with him who was the one joy of his life , whether his hard life on earth , or his blessed life in heaven .
Parsing [sent. 676 len. 93]: The Macruadh set down the creel , and taking out peat after peat , piled them up against the wall , where already a good many waited their turn to be laid on the fire ; for , as the old woman said , she must carry a few when she could , and get ahead with her store ere the winter came , or she would soon be devoured : there was a death that always prowled about old people , she said , watching for the fire to go out .
Parsing [sent. 677 len. 27]: Many of the Celts are by nature poets , and mistress Conal often spoke in a manner seldom heard from the lips of a lowland woman .
Parsing [sent. 678 len. 55]: The common forms of Gaelic are more poetic than those of most languages , and could have originated only with a poetic people , while mistress Conal was by no means an ordinary type of her people ; maugre her ill temper and gruffness , she thought as well as spoke like a poetess .
Parsing [sent. 679 len. 20]: This , conjoined with the gift of the second sight , had helped to her reputation as a witch .
Parsing [sent. 680 len. 11]: As the chief piled the peats , he counted them .
Parsing [sent. 681 len. 20]: She sat watching him and them from a stone that made part of a rude rampart to the hearth .
Parsing [sent. 682 len. 9]: `` I told you so , Macruadh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 683 len. 18]: she said , the moment she saw his hand return empty from the bottom of the creel .
Parsing [sent. 684 len. 10]: `` I was positive there should be three more !
Parsing [sent. 685 len. 14]: -- But what 's on the road is not with the devil . ''
Parsing [sent. 686 len. 7]: `` I am very sorry ! ''
Parsing [sent. 687 len. 13]: said the chief , who thought it wiser not to contradict her .
Parsing [sent. 688 len. 35]: He would have searched his sporan for a coin to make up to her for the supposed loss of her peats ; but he knew well enough there was not a coin in it .
Parsing [sent. 689 len. 80]: He shook hands with her , bade her good night , and went , closing the door carefully behind him against a great gust of wind that struggled to enter , threatening to sweep the fire she was now blowing at with her wrinkled , leather-like lips , off the hearth altogether -- a thing that had happened before , to the danger of the whole building , itself of the substance burning in the middle of its floor .
Parsing [sent. 690 len. 19]: The Macruadh ran down the last few steep steps of the path , and jumped into the road .
Parsing [sent. 691 len. 22]: Through the darkness came the sound of one springing aside with a great start , and the click of a gun-lock .
Parsing [sent. 692 len. 6]: `` Who goes there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 693 len. 6]: cried a rather tremulous voice .
Parsing [sent. 694 len. 9]: `` The Macruadh , '' answered the chief .
Parsing [sent. 695 len. 6]: The utterance apparently conveyed nothing .
Parsing [sent. 696 len. 9]: `` Do you belong to these parts ? ''
Parsing [sent. 697 len. 4]: said the voice .
Parsing [sent. 698 len. 26]: A former Macruadh might have answered , `` No ; these parts belong to me ; '' Alister curtly replied , `` I do . ''
Parsing [sent. 699 len. 8]: `` Here then , my good fellow !
Parsing [sent. 700 len. 21]: take my game-bag , and carry it as far as the New House -- if you know where I mean .
Parsing [sent. 701 len. 8]: I will give you a shilling . ''
Parsing [sent. 702 len. 18]: One moment the chief spent in repressing a foolish indignation ; the next he spent in reflection .
Parsing [sent. 703 len. 50]: Had he seen how pale and tired was the youth with the gun , he would have offered to carry his bag for him ; to offer and to be asked , however , most people find different ; and here the offer of payment added to the difficulty .
Parsing [sent. 704 len. 34]: But the word SHILLING had raised the vision of the old woman in her lonely cottage , brooding over the loss , real or imaginary mattered nothing , of her three far-borne peats .
Parsing [sent. 705 len. 24]: What a happy night , through all the wind and the rain , would a silver shilling under her chaff pillow give her !
Parsing [sent. 706 len. 13]: The thought froze the chief 's pride , and warmed his heart .
Parsing [sent. 707 len. 11]: What right had he to deny her such a pleasure !
Parsing [sent. 708 len. 6]: It would cost him nothing !
Parsing [sent. 709 len. 9]: It would even bring him a little amusement !
Parsing [sent. 710 len. 16]: The chief of Clanruadh carrying his game-bag for a Sasunnach fellow to earn a shilling !
Parsing [sent. 711 len. 11]: the idea had a touch of humorous consolation in it .
Parsing [sent. 712 len. 32]: I will not assert the consolation strong enough to cast quite out a certain feeling of shame that mingled with his amusement -- a shame which -- is it not odd !
Parsing [sent. 713 len. 14]: -- he would not have felt had his sporan been full of sovereigns .
Parsing [sent. 714 len. 36]: But the shame was not altogether a shameful one ; a fanciful fear of degrading the chieftainship , and a vague sense of the thing being an imposition , had each a part in it .
Parsing [sent. 715 len. 18]: There could be nothing dishonest , however , in thus earning a shilling for poor mistress Conal !
Parsing [sent. 716 len. 25]: `` I will carry your bag , '' he said , `` but I must have the shilling first , if you please . ''
Parsing [sent. 717 len. 4]: `` Oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 718 len. 4]: rejoined Valentine Palmer .
Parsing [sent. 719 len. 7]: `` You do not trust me !
Parsing [sent. 720 len. 9]: How then am I to trust you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 721 len. 4]: `` Sir ! ''
Parsing [sent. 722 len. 17]: exclaimed Alister -- and , again finding himself on the point of being foolish , laughed .
Parsing [sent. 723 len. 15]: `` I will pay you when the job is done , '' said Valentine .
Parsing [sent. 724 len. 18]: `` That is quite fair , but it does not suit my purpose , '' returned Alister .
Parsing [sent. 725 len. 20]: They were walking along the road side by side , but each could scarcely see anything of the other .
Parsing [sent. 726 len. 11]: The sportsman was searching his pockets to find a shilling .
Parsing [sent. 727 len. 22]: He succeeded , and , groping , put it in Alister 's hand , with the words -- `` All right !
Parsing [sent. 728 len. 6]: it is only a shilling !
Parsing [sent. 729 len. 4]: There it is !
Parsing [sent. 730 len. 13]: But it is not yours yet : here is the bag ! ''
Parsing [sent. 731 len. 11]: Alister took the bag , turned , and ran back .
Parsing [sent. 732 len. 4]: `` Hillo ! ''
Parsing [sent. 733 len. 3]: cried Valentine .
Parsing [sent. 734 len. 27]: But Alister had disappeared , and as soon as he turned up the soft path to the cottage , his steps became inaudible through the wind .
Parsing [sent. 735 len. 35]: He opened the door , went in , laid the shilling on the back of the old woman 's hand , and without a word hurried out again , and down to the road .
Parsing [sent. 736 len. 32]: The stranger was some distance ahead , tramping wearily on through the darkness , and grumbling at his folly in bribing a fellow with a shilling to carry off his game-bag .
Parsing [sent. 737 len. 4]: Alister overtook him .
Parsing [sent. 738 len. 10]: `` Oh , here you are after all ! ''
Parsing [sent. 739 len. 3]: exclaimed Valentine .
Parsing [sent. 740 len. 13]: `` I thought you had made off with work and wages both !
Parsing [sent. 741 len. 8]: What did you do it for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 742 len. 15]: `` I wanted to give the shilling to an old woman close by . ''
Parsing [sent. 743 len. 7]: `` Your mother -- eh ? ''
Parsing [sent. 744 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 745 len. 5]: `` Your grandmother ? ''
Parsing [sent. 746 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 747 len. 6]: `` SOME relation then ! ''
Parsing [sent. 748 len. 4]: insisted the stranger .
Parsing [sent. 749 len. 16]: `` Doubtless , '' answered the laird , and Valentine thought him a surly fellow .
Parsing [sent. 750 len. 6]: They walked on in silence .
Parsing [sent. 751 len. 23]: The youth could hardly keep up with Alister , who thought him ill bred , and did not care for his company .
Parsing [sent. 752 len. 9]: `` Why do you walk so fast ? ''
Parsing [sent. 753 len. 3]: said Valentine .
Parsing [sent. 754 len. 12]: `` Because I want to get home , '' replied Alister .
Parsing [sent. 755 len. 11]: `` But I paid you to keep me company ! ''
Parsing [sent. 756 len. 9]: `` You paid me to carry your bag .
Parsing [sent. 757 len. 10]: I will leave it at the New House . ''
Parsing [sent. 758 len. 7]: His coolness roused the weary youth .
Parsing [sent. 759 len. 5]: `` You rascal ! ''
Parsing [sent. 760 len. 17]: he said ; `` you keep alongside of me , or I 'll pepper you . ''
Parsing [sent. 761 len. 9]: As he spoke , he shifted his gun .
Parsing [sent. 762 len. 20]: But Alister had already , with a few long strides , put a space of utter darkness between them .
Parsing [sent. 763 len. 21]: He had taken the shilling , and must carry the bag , but did not feel bound to personal attendance .
Parsing [sent. 764 len. 20]: At the same time he could not deny there was reason in the man 's unwillingness to trust him .
Parsing [sent. 765 len. 11]: What had he about him to give him in pledge ?
Parsing [sent. 766 len. 21]: Nothing but his watch , his father 's , a gift of THE PRINCE to the head of the family !
Parsing [sent. 767 len. 13]: -- he could not profane that by depositing it for a game-bag !
Parsing [sent. 768 len. 20]: He must yield to his employer , moderate his pace , and move side by side with the Sasunnach !
Parsing [sent. 769 len. 8]: Again they walked some distance in silence .
Parsing [sent. 770 len. 16]: Alister began to discover that his companion was weary , and his good heart spoke .
Parsing [sent. 771 len. 11]: `` Let me carry your gun , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 772 len. 6]: `` See you damned ! ''
Parsing [sent. 773 len. 8]: returned Valentine , with an angry laugh .
Parsing [sent. 774 len. 10]: `` You fancy your gun protects your bag ? ''
Parsing [sent. 775 len. 5]: `` I do . ''
Parsing [sent. 776 len. 22]: The same instant the gun was drawn , with swift quiet force , through the loop of his arm from behind .
Parsing [sent. 777 len. 30]: Feeling himself defenceless , he sprang at the highlander , but he eluded him , and in a moment was out of his reach , lost in the darkness .
Parsing [sent. 778 len. 31]: He heard the lock of one barrel snap : it was not loaded ; the second barrel went off , and he gave a great jump , imagining himself struck .
Parsing [sent. 779 len. 11]: The next instant the gun was below his arm again .
Parsing [sent. 780 len. 10]: `` It will be lighter to carry now ! ''
Parsing [sent. 781 len. 15]: said the Macruadh ; `` but if you like I will take it . ''
Parsing [sent. 782 len. 6]: `` Take it , then .
Parsing [sent. 783 len. 3]: But no !
Parsing [sent. 784 len. 21]: -- By Jove , I wish there was light enough to see what sort of a rascal you look ! ''
Parsing [sent. 785 len. 8]: `` You are not very polite ! ''
Parsing [sent. 786 len. 6]: `` Mind your own politeness .
Parsing [sent. 787 len. 10]: I was never so roughly served in my life !
Parsing [sent. 788 len. 11]: -- by a fellow too that had taken my money !
Parsing [sent. 789 len. 32]: If I knew where to find a magistrate in this beastly place , -- '' `` You would tell him I emptied your gun because you threatened me with it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 790 len. 10]: `` You were going off with my bag ! ''
Parsing [sent. 791 len. 18]: `` Because I undertook to carry your bag , was I bound to endure your company ? ''
Parsing [sent. 792 len. 4]: `` Alister ! ''
Parsing [sent. 793 len. 9]: said a quiet voice out of the darkness .
Parsing [sent. 794 len. 26]: The highlander started , and in a tone strangely tremulous , yet with a kind of triumph in it , answered -- `` Ian ! ''
Parsing [sent. 795 len. 22]: The one word said , he stood still , but as in the act to run , staring into the darkness .
Parsing [sent. 796 len. 19]: The next moment he flung down the game-bag , and two men were in each other 's arms .
Parsing [sent. 797 len. 9]: `` Where are you from , Ian ? ''
Parsing [sent. 798 len. 13]: said the chief at length , in a voice broken with gladness .
Parsing [sent. 799 len. 31]: All Valentine understood of the question , for it was in Gaelic , was its emotion , and he scorned a fellow to show the least sign of breaking down .
Parsing [sent. 800 len. 10]: `` Straight from Moscow , '' answered the new-comer .
Parsing [sent. 801 len. 7]: `` How is our mother ? ''
Parsing [sent. 802 len. 9]: `` Well , Ian , thank God ! ''
Parsing [sent. 803 len. 11]: `` Then , thank God , all is well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 804 len. 10]: `` What brought you home in such haste ? ''
Parsing [sent. 805 len. 16]: `` I had a bad dream about my mother , and was a little anxious .
Parsing [sent. 806 len. 14]: There was more reason too , which I will tell you afterwards . ''
Parsing [sent. 807 len. 8]: `` What were you doing in Moscow ?
Parsing [sent. 808 len. 6]: Have you a furlough ? ''
Parsing [sent. 809 len. 10]: `` No ; I am a sort of deserter .
Parsing [sent. 810 len. 14]: I would have thrown up my commission , but had not a chance .
Parsing [sent. 811 len. 18]: In Moscow I was teaching in a school to keep out of the way of the police .
Parsing [sent. 812 len. 11]: But I will tell you all by and by . ''
Parsing [sent. 813 len. 22]: The voice was low , veiled , and sad ; the joy of the meeting rippled through it like a brook .
Parsing [sent. 814 len. 23]: The brothers had forgotten the stranger , and stood talking till the patience of Valentine was as much exhausted as his strength .
Parsing [sent. 815 len. 11]: `` Are you going to stand there all night ? ''
Parsing [sent. 816 len. 5]: he said at last .
Parsing [sent. 817 len. 32]: `` This is no doubt very interesting to you , but it is rather a bore to one who can neither see you , nor understand a word you say . ''
Parsing [sent. 818 len. 12]: `` Is the gentleman a friend of yours , Alister ? ''
Parsing [sent. 819 len. 3]: asked Ian .
Parsing [sent. 820 len. 4]: `` Not exactly .
Parsing [sent. 821 len. 24]: -- But he is a Sasunnach , '' he concluded in English , `` and we ought not to be speaking Gaelic . ''
Parsing [sent. 822 len. 10]: `` I beg his pardon , '' said Ian .
Parsing [sent. 823 len. 7]: `` Will you introduce me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 824 len. 12]: `` It is impossible ; I do not know his name .
Parsing [sent. 825 len. 12]: I never saw him , and do n't see him now .
Parsing [sent. 826 len. 8]: But he insists on my company . ''
Parsing [sent. 827 len. 7]: `` That is a great compliment .
Parsing [sent. 828 len. 4]: How far ? ''
Parsing [sent. 829 len. 7]: `` To the New House . ''
Parsing [sent. 830 len. 15]: `` I paid him a shilling to carry my bag , '' said Valentine .
Parsing [sent. 831 len. 17]: `` He took the shilling , and was going to walk off with my bag ! ''
Parsing [sent. 832 len. 4]: `` Well ? ''
Parsing [sent. 833 len. 4]: `` Well indeed !
Parsing [sent. 834 len. 5]: Not at all well !
Parsing [sent. 835 len. 17]: How was I to know -- '' `` But he did n't -- did he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 836 len. 13]: said Ian , whose voice seemed now to tingle with amusement . ''
Parsing [sent. 837 len. 8]: -- Alister , you were wrong . ''
Parsing [sent. 838 len. 12]: It was an illogical face-about , but Alister responded at once .
Parsing [sent. 839 len. 9]: `` I know it , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 840 len. 12]: `` The moment I heard your voice , I knew it .
Parsing [sent. 841 len. 33]: -- How is it , Ian , '' -- here he fell back into Gaelic -- `` that when you are by me , I know what is right so much quicker ?
Parsing [sent. 842 len. 6]: I do n't understand it .
Parsing [sent. 843 len. 16]: I meant to do right , but -- '' `` But your pride got up .
Parsing [sent. 844 len. 18]: Alister , you always set out well -- nobly -- and then comes the devil 's turn !
Parsing [sent. 845 len. 10]: Then you begin to do as if you repented !
Parsing [sent. 846 len. 10]: You do n't carry the thing right straight out .
Parsing [sent. 847 len. 15]: I hate to see the devil make a fool of a man like you !
Parsing [sent. 848 len. 16]: Do YOU not know that in your own country you owe a stranger hospitality ? ''
Parsing [sent. 849 len. 6]: `` My own country ! ''
Parsing [sent. 850 len. 6]: echoed Alister with a groan .
Parsing [sent. 851 len. 18]: `` Yes , your own country -- and perhaps more yours than it was your grandfather 's !
Parsing [sent. 852 len. 14]: You know who said , ` The meek shall inherit the earth ' !
Parsing [sent. 853 len. 24]: If it be not ours in God 's way , I for one would not care to call it mine another way . ''
Parsing [sent. 854 len. 8]: -- Here he changed again to English .
Parsing [sent. 855 len. 15]: -- `` But we must not keep the gentleman standing while we talk ! ''
Parsing [sent. 856 len. 5]: `` Thank you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 857 len. 3]: said Valentine .
Parsing [sent. 858 len. 11]: `` The fact is , I 'm dead beat . ''
Parsing [sent. 859 len. 11]: `` Have you anything I could carry for you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 860 len. 3]: asked Ian .
Parsing [sent. 861 len. 7]: `` No , I thank you .
Parsing [sent. 862 len. 5]: -- Yes ; there !
Parsing [sent. 863 len. 9]: if you do n't mind taking my gun ?
Parsing [sent. 864 len. 8]: -- you speak like a gentleman ! ''
Parsing [sent. 865 len. 9]: `` I will take it with pleasure . ''
Parsing [sent. 866 len. 9]: He took the gun , and they started .
Parsing [sent. 867 len. 42]: `` If you choose , Alister , '' said his brother , once more in Gaelic , `` to break through conventionalities , you must not expect people to allow you to creep inside them again the moment you please . ''
Parsing [sent. 868 len. 10]: But the young fellow 's fatigue had touched Alister .
Parsing [sent. 869 len. 8]: `` Are you a big man ? ''
Parsing [sent. 870 len. 10]: he said , taking Valentine gently by the arm .
Parsing [sent. 871 len. 24]: `` Not so big as you , I 'll lay you a sovereign , '' answered Valentine , wondering why he should ask .
Parsing [sent. 872 len. 6]: `` Then look here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 873 len. 17]: said Alister ; `` you get astride my shoulders , and I 'll carry you home .
Parsing [sent. 874 len. 15]: I believe you 're hungry , and that takes the pith out of you !
Parsing [sent. 875 len. 28]: -- Come , '' he went on , perceiving some sign of reluctance in the youth , `` you 'll break down if you walk much farther !
Parsing [sent. 876 len. 5]: -- Here , Ian !
Parsing [sent. 877 len. 15]: you take the bag ; you can manage that and the gun too ! ''
Parsing [sent. 878 len. 44]: Valentine murmured some objection ; but the brothers took the thing so much as a matter of course , and he felt so terribly exhausted -- for he had lost his way , and been out since the morning -- that he yielded .
Parsing [sent. 879 len. 47]: Alister doubled himself up on his heels ; Valentine got his weary legs over his stalwart shoulders ; the chief rose with him as if he had been no heavier than mistress Conal 's creel , and bore him along much relieved in his aching limbs .
Parsing [sent. 880 len. 52]: So little was the chief oppressed by his burden , that he and his brother kept up a stream of conversation , every now and then forgetting their manners and gliding off into Gaelic , but as often recollecting themselves , apologizing , and starting afresh upon the path of English .
Parsing [sent. 881 len. 50]: Long before they reached the end of their journey , Valentine , able from his perch to listen in some measure of ease , came to understand that he had to do , not with rustics , but , whatever their peculiarities , with gentlemen of a noteworthy sort .
Parsing [sent. 882 len. 48]: The brothers , in the joy of their reunion , talked much of things at home and abroad , avoiding things personal and domestic as often as they spoke English ; but when they saw the lights of the New House , a silence fell upon them .
Parsing [sent. 883 len. 11]: At the door , Alister set his burden carefully down .
Parsing [sent. 884 len. 4]: `` There ! ''
Parsing [sent. 885 len. 16]: he said with a laugh , `` I hope I have earned my shilling ! ''
Parsing [sent. 886 len. 21]: `` Ten times over , '' answered Valentine ; `` but I know better now than offer to pay you .
Parsing [sent. 887 len. 9]: I thank you with all my heart . ''
Parsing [sent. 888 len. 23]: The door opened , Ian gave the gun and the bag to the butler , and the brothers bade Valentine good night .
Parsing [sent. 889 len. 8]: Valentine had a strange tale to tell .
Parsing [sent. 890 len. 28]: Sercombe refused to accept his conclusions : if he had offered the men half a crown apiece , he said , they would have pocketed the money .
Parsing [sent. 891 len. 3]: CHAPTER VII .
Parsing [sent. 892 len. 4]: MOTHER AND SON .
Parsing [sent. 893 len. 15]: The sun was shining bright , and the laird was out in his fields .
Parsing [sent. 894 len. 22]: His oats were nearly ready for the scythe , and he was judging where he had best begin to cut them .
Parsing [sent. 895 len. 30]: His fields lay chiefly along the banks of the stream , occupying the whole breadth of the valley on the east side of the ridge where the cottage stood .
Parsing [sent. 896 len. 43]: On the west side of the ridge , nearly parallel to , and not many yards from it , a small brook ran to join the stream : this was a march betwixt the chief 's land and Mr. Peregrine Palmer 's .
Parsing [sent. 897 len. 10]: Their respective limit was not everywhere so well defined .
Parsing [sent. 898 len. 12]: The air was clear and clean , and full of life .
Parsing [sent. 899 len. 5]: The wind was asleep .
Parsing [sent. 900 len. 39]: A consciousness of work approaching completion filled earth and air -- a mood of calm expectation , as of a man who sees his end drawing nigh , and awaits the saving judgment of the father of spirits .
Parsing [sent. 901 len. 47]: There was no song of birds -- only a crow from the yard , or the cry of a blackcock from the hill ; the two streams were left to do all the singing , and they did their best , though their water was low .
Parsing [sent. 902 len. 34]: The day was of the evening of the year ; in the full sunshine was present the twilight and the coming night , but there was a sense of readiness on all sides .
Parsing [sent. 903 len. 16]: The fruits of the earth must be housed ; that alone remained to be done .
Parsing [sent. 904 len. 30]: When the laird had made up his mind , he turned towards the house -- a lowly cottage , more extensive than many farmhouses , but looking no better .
Parsing [sent. 905 len. 43]: It was well built , with an outside wall of rough stone and lime , and another wall of turf within , lined in parts with wood , making it as warm a nest as any house of the size could be .
Parsing [sent. 906 len. 16]: The door , picturesque with abundant repair , opened by a latch into the kitchen .
Parsing [sent. 907 len. 64]: For long years the floor of the kitchen had been an earthen one , with the fire on a hearth in the middle of it , as in all the cottages ; and the smoke rose into the roof , keeping it very dry and warm , if also very sooty , and thence into the air through a hole in the middle .
Parsing [sent. 908 len. 47]: But some ten years before this time , Alister and Ian , mere lads , had built a chimney outside , and opening the wall , removed the hearth to it -- with the smoke also , which now had its own private way to liberty .
Parsing [sent. 909 len. 46]: They then paved the floor with such stones as they could find , in the fields and on the hill , sufficiently flat and smooth on one side , and by sinking them according to their thickness , managed to get a tolerably even surface .
Parsing [sent. 910 len. 45]: Many other improvements followed ; and although it was a poor place still , it would at the time of Dr. Johnson 's visit to the highlands have been counted a good house , not to be despised by unambitious knight or poor baronet .
Parsing [sent. 911 len. 26]: Nor was the time yet over , when ladies and gentlemen , of all courtesy and good breeding , might be found in such houses .
Parsing [sent. 912 len. 39]: In the kitchen a deal-dresser , scoured white , stood under one of the tiny windows , giving light enough for a clean-souled cook -- and what window-light would ever be enough for one of a different sort ?
Parsing [sent. 913 len. 25]: There were only four panes in it , but it opened and closed with a button , and so was superior to many windows .
Parsing [sent. 914 len. 31]: There was a larger on the opposite side , which at times in the winter nights when the cold was great , they filled bodily with a barricade of turf .
Parsing [sent. 915 len. 15]: Here , in the kitchen , the chief takes his meals with his lady-mother .
Parsing [sent. 916 len. 19]: She and Ian have just finished their breakfast , and gone to the other end of the house .
Parsing [sent. 917 len. 8]: The laird broke his fast long ago .
Parsing [sent. 918 len. 20]: A fire is burning on the hearth -- small , for the mid-day-meal is not yet on its way .
Parsing [sent. 919 len. 35]: Everything is tidy ; the hearth is swept up , and the dishes are washed : the barefooted girl is reaching the last of them to its place on the rack hehind the dresser .
Parsing [sent. 920 len. 26]: She is a red-haired , blue-eyed Celt , with a pretty face , and a refinement of motion and speech rarer in some other peasantries .
Parsing [sent. 921 len. 13]: The chief enters , and takes from the wall an old-fashioned gun .
Parsing [sent. 922 len. 16]: He wants a bird or two , for Ian 's home-coming is a great event .
Parsing [sent. 923 len. 32]: `` I saw a big stag last night down by the burn , sir , '' said the girl , `` feeding as if he had been the red cow . ''
Parsing [sent. 924 len. 15]: `` I do n't want him to-day , Nancy , '' returned her master .
Parsing [sent. 925 len. 7]: `` Had he big horns ? ''
Parsing [sent. 926 len. 17]: `` Great horns , sir ; but it was too dark to count the tines . ''
Parsing [sent. 927 len. 5]: `` When was it ?
Parsing [sent. 928 len. 8]: Why did you not tell me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 929 len. 22]: `` I thought it was morning , sir , and when I got up it was the middle of the night .
Parsing [sent. 930 len. 15]: The moon was so shiny that I went to the door and looked out .
Parsing [sent. 931 len. 12]: Just at the narrow leap , I saw him plain . ''
Parsing [sent. 932 len. 13]: `` If you should see him again , Nancy , scare him .
Parsing [sent. 933 len. 15]: I do n't want the Sasunnachs at the New House to see him . ''
Parsing [sent. 934 len. 11]: `` Had n't you better take him yourself , Macruadh ?
Parsing [sent. 935 len. 10]: He would make fine hams for the winter ! ''
Parsing [sent. 936 len. 30]: `` Mind your own business , Nancy , and hold your tongue , '' said the chief , with a smile that took all the harshness from the words .
Parsing [sent. 937 len. 11]: `` Do n't you tell any one you saw him .
Parsing [sent. 938 len. 12]: For what you know he may be the big stag ! ''
Parsing [sent. 939 len. 11]: `` Sure no one would kill HIM , sir ! ''
Parsing [sent. 940 len. 5]: answered the girl aghast .
Parsing [sent. 941 len. 5]: `` I hope not .
Parsing [sent. 942 len. 18]: But get the stoving-pot ready , Nancy ; I 'm going to find a bird or two .
Parsing [sent. 943 len. 15]: Lest I should not succeed , have a couple of chickens at hand . ''
Parsing [sent. 944 len. 11]: `` Sir , the mistress has commanded them already . ''
Parsing [sent. 945 len. 19]: `` That is well ; but do not kill them except I am not back in time . ''
Parsing [sent. 946 len. 7]: `` I understand , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 947 len. 54]: Macruadh knew the stag as well as the horse he rode , and that his habit had for some time been to come down at night and feed on the small border of rich grass on the south side of the burn , between it and the abrupt heathery rise of the hill .
Parsing [sent. 948 len. 39]: For there the burn ran so near the hill , and the ground was so covered with huge masses of grey rock , that there was hardly room for cultivation , and the bank was left in grass .
Parsing [sent. 949 len. 18]: The stalking of the stag was the passion of the highlander in that part of the country .
Parsing [sent. 950 len. 35]: He cared little for shooting the grouse , black or red , and almost despised those whose ambition was a full bag of such game ; he dreamed day and night of killing deer .
Parsing [sent. 951 len. 20]: The chief , however , was in this matter more of a man without being less of a highlander .
Parsing [sent. 952 len. 52]: He loved the deer so much , saw them so much a part of the glory of mountain and sky , sunshine and storm , that he liked to see them living , not dead , and only now and then shot one , when the family had need of it .
Parsing [sent. 953 len. 40]: He felt himself indeed almost the father of the deer as well as of his clan , and mourned greatly that he could do so little now , from the limited range of his property , to protect them .
Parsing [sent. 954 len. 59]: His love for live creatures was not quite equal to that of St. Francis , for he had not conceived the thought of turning wolf or fox from the error of his ways ; but even the creatures that preyed upon others he killed only from a sense of duty , and with no pleasure in their death .
Parsing [sent. 955 len. 13]: The heartlessness of the common type of sportsman was loathsome to him .
Parsing [sent. 956 len. 84]: When there was not much doing on the farm , he would sometimes be out all night with his gun , it is true , but he would seldom fire it , and then only at some beast of prey ; on the hill-side or in the valley he would lie watching the ways and doings of the many creatures that roam the night -- each with its object , each with its reasons , each with its fitting of means to ends .
Parsing [sent. 957 len. 25]: One of the grounds of his dislike to the new possessors of the old land was the raid he feared upon the wild animals .
Parsing [sent. 958 len. 22]: The laird gone , I will take my reader into the PARLOUR , as they called in English their one sitting-room .
Parsing [sent. 959 len. 20]: Shall I first tell him what the room was like , or first describe the two persons in it ?
Parsing [sent. 960 len. 77]: Led up to a picture , I certainly should not look first at the frame ; but a description is a process of painting rather than a picture ; and when you can not see the thing in one , but must take each part by itself , and in your mind get it into relation with the rest , there is an advantage , I think , in having a notion of the frame first .
Parsing [sent. 961 len. 44]: For one thing , you can not see the persons without imagining their surroundings , and if those should be unfittingly imagined , they interfere with the truth of the persons , and you may not be able to get them right after .
Parsing [sent. 962 len. 18]: The room , then , was about fifteen feet by twelve , and the ceiling was low .
Parsing [sent. 963 len. 42]: On the white walls hung a few frames , of which two or three contained water-colours -- not very good , but not displeasing ; several held miniature portraits -- mostly in red coats , and one or two a silhouette .
Parsing [sent. 964 len. 16]: Opposite the door hung a target of hide , round , and bossed with brass .
Parsing [sent. 965 len. 36]: Alister had come upon it in the house , covering a meal-barrel , to which service it had probably been put in aid of its eluding a search for arms after the battle of Culloden .
Parsing [sent. 966 len. 27]: Never more to cover man 's food from mice , or his person from an enemy , it was raised to the WALHALLA of the parlour .
Parsing [sent. 967 len. 75]: Under it rested , horizontally upon two nails , the sword of the chief -- a long and broad ANDREW FERRARA , with a plated basket-hilt ; beside it hung a dirk -- longer than usual , and fine in form , with a carved hilt in the shape of an eagle 's head and neck , and its sheath , whose leather was dry and flaky with age , heavily mounted in silver .
Parsing [sent. 968 len. 24]: Below these was a card-table of marquetry with spindle-legs , and on it a work-box of ivory , inlaid with silver and ebony .
Parsing [sent. 969 len. 21]: In the corner stood a harp , an Erard , golden and gracious , not a string of it broken .
Parsing [sent. 970 len. 18]: In the middle of the room was a small square table , covered with a green cloth .
Parsing [sent. 971 len. 23]: An old-fashioned easy chair stood by the chimney ; and one sat in it whom to see was to forget her surroundings .
Parsing [sent. 972 len. 21]: In middle age she is still beautiful , with the rare beauty that shines from the root of the being .
Parsing [sent. 973 len. 49]: Her hair is of the darkest brown , almost black ; her eyes are very dark , and her skin is very fair , though the soft bloom , as of reflected sunset , is gone from her cheek , and her hair shows lines of keen silver .
Parsing [sent. 974 len. 47]: Her features are fine , clear , and regular -- the chin a little strong perhaps , not for the size , but the fineness of the rest ; her form is that of a younger woman ; her hand and foot are long and delicate .
Parsing [sent. 975 len. 15]: A more refined and courteous presence could not have been found in the island .
Parsing [sent. 976 len. 24]: The dignity of her carriage nowise marred its grace , or betrayed the least consciousness ; she looked dignified because she was dignified .
Parsing [sent. 977 len. 30]: That form of falsehood which consists in assuming the look of what one fain would be , was , as much as any other , impossible to Isobel Macruadh .
Parsing [sent. 978 len. 20]: She wore no cap ; her hair was gathered in a large knot near the top of her head .
Parsing [sent. 979 len. 20]: Her gown was of a dark print ; she had no ornament except a ring with a single ruby .
Parsing [sent. 980 len. 10]: She was working a bit of net into lace .
Parsing [sent. 981 len. 24]: She could speak Gaelic as well as any in the glen -- perhaps better ; but to her sons she always spoke English .
Parsing [sent. 982 len. 22]: To them indeed English was their mother-tongue , in the sense that English only came addressed to themselves from her lips .
Parsing [sent. 983 len. 19]: There were , she said , plenty to teach them Gaelic ; she must see to their English .
Parsing [sent. 984 len. 35]: The one window of the parlour , though not large , was of tolerable size ; but little light entered , so shaded was it with a rose-tree in a pot on the sill .
Parsing [sent. 985 len. 28]: By the wall opposite was a couch , and on the couch lay Ian with a book in his hand -- a book in a strange language .
Parsing [sent. 986 len. 28]: His mother and he would sometimes be a whole morning together and exchange no more than a word or two , though many a look and smile .
Parsing [sent. 987 len. 13]: It seemed enough for each to be in the other 's company .
Parsing [sent. 988 len. 10]: There was a quite peculiar hond between the two .
Parsing [sent. 989 len. 51]: Like so many of the young men of that country , Ian had been intended for the army ; but there was in him this much of the spirit of the eagle he resembled , that he passionately loved freedom , and had almost a gypsy 's delight in wandering .
Parsing [sent. 990 len. 29]: When he left college , he became tutor in a Russian family of distinction , and after that accepted a commission in the household troops of the Czar .
Parsing [sent. 991 len. 39]: But wherever he went , he seemed , as he said once to his mother , almost physically aware of a line stretching between him and her , which seemed to vibrate when he grew anxious about her .
Parsing [sent. 992 len. 16]: The bond between him and his brother was equally strong , but in feeling different .
Parsing [sent. 993 len. 32]: Between him and Alister it was a cable ; between him and his mother a harpstring ; in the one case it was a muscle , in the other a nerve .
Parsing [sent. 994 len. 9]: The one retained , the other drew him .
Parsing [sent. 995 len. 29]: Given to roaming as he was , again and again he returned , from pure love-longing , to what he always felt as the PROTECTION of his mother .
Parsing [sent. 996 len. 25]: It was protection indeed he often had sought -- protection from his own glooms , which nothing but her love seemed able to tenuate .
Parsing [sent. 997 len. 22]: He was tall -- if an inch above six feet be tall , but not of his brother 's fine proportion .
Parsing [sent. 998 len. 15]: He was thin , with long slender fingers and feet like his mother 's .
Parsing [sent. 999 len. 24]: His small , strong bones were covered with little more than hard muscle , but every motion of limb or body was grace .
Parsing [sent. 1000 len. 55]: At times , when lost in thought and unconscious of movement , an observer might have imagined him in conversation with some one unseen , towards whom he was carrying himself with courtesy : plain it was that courtesy with him was not a graft upon the finest stock , but an essential element .
Parsing [sent. 1001 len. 44]: His forehead was rather low , freckled , and crowned with hair of a foxy red ; his eyes were of the glass-gray or green loved of our elder poets ; his nose was a very eagle in itself -- large and fine .
Parsing [sent. 1002 len. 76]: He more resembled the mask of the dead Shakspere than any other I have met , only in him the proportions were a little exaggerated ; his nose was a little too large , and his mouth a little too small for the mask ; but the mingled sweetness and strength in the curves of the latter prevented the impression of weakness generally given by the association of such a nose and such a mouth .
Parsing [sent. 1003 len. 20]: On his short upper lip was a small light moustache , and on his face not a hair more .
Parsing [sent. 1004 len. 19]: In rest his countenance wore a great calmness , but a calmness that might seem rooted in sadness .
Parsing [sent. 1005 len. 51]: While the mother might , more than once in a day , differ to fault-finding from her elder-born -- whom she admired , notwithstanding , as well as loved , from the bottom of her heart -- she was never KNOWN to say a word in opposition to the younger .
Parsing [sent. 1006 len. 11]: It was even whispered that she was afraid of him .
Parsing [sent. 1007 len. 42]: It was not so ; but her reverence for Ian was such that , even when she felt bound not to agree with him , she seldom had the confidence that , differing from HIM , she was in the right .
Parsing [sent. 1008 len. 39]: Sometimes in the middle of the night she would slip like a ghost into the room where he lay , and sit by his bed till the black cock , the gray cock , the red cock crew .
Parsing [sent. 1009 len. 23]: The son might be awake all the time , and the mother suspect him awake , yet no word pass between them .
Parsing [sent. 1010 len. 9]: She would rise and go as she came .
Parsing [sent. 1011 len. 22]: Her feeling for her younger son was like that of Hannah for her eldest -- intensest love mixed with strangest reverence .
Parsing [sent. 1012 len. 14]: But there were vast alternations and inexplicable minglings in her thoughts of him .
Parsing [sent. 1013 len. 37]: At one moment she would regard him as gifted beyond his fellows for some great work , at another be filled with a horrible fear that he was in rebellion against the God of his life .
Parsing [sent. 1014 len. 60]: Doubtless mothers are far too ready to think THEIR sons above the ordinary breed of sons : self , unpossessed of God , will worship itself in its offspring ; yet the sons whom HOLY mothers have regarded as born to great things and who have passed away without sign , may have gone on toward their great things .
Parsing [sent. 1015 len. 77]: Whether this mother thought too much of her son or not , there were questions moving in his mind which she could not have understood -- even then when he would creep to her bed in the morning to forget in her arms the terrible dreams of the night , or when at evening he would draw his little stool to her knee , unable or unwilling to enjoy his book anywhere but by her side .
Parsing [sent. 1016 len. 42]: What gave him his unconscious power over his mother , was , first , the things he said , and next , the things he did not say ; for he seemed to her to dwell always in a rich silence .
Parsing [sent. 1017 len. 49]: Yet throughout was she aware of a something between them , across which they could not meet ; and it was in part her distress at the seeming impossibility of effecting a spiritual union with her son , that made her so desirous of personal proximity to him .
Parsing [sent. 1018 len. 32]: Such union is by most thinking people presumed impossible without consent of opinion , and this mistake rendered her unable to FEEL near him , to be at home with him .
Parsing [sent. 1019 len. 41]: If she had believed that they understood each other , that they were of like OPINION , she would not have been half so unhappy when he went away , would not have longed half so grievously for his return .
Parsing [sent. 1020 len. 21]: Ian on his part understood his mother , but knew she did not understand him , and was therefore troubled .
Parsing [sent. 1021 len. 35]: Hence it resulted that always after a time came the hour -- which never came to her -- when he could endure proximity without oneness no longer , and would suddenly announce his departure .
Parsing [sent. 1022 len. 58]: And after a day or two of his absence , the mother would be doubly wretched to find a sort of relief in it , and would spend wakeful nights trying to oust it as the merest fancy , persuading herself that she was miserable , and nothing but miserable , in the loss of her darling .
Parsing [sent. 1023 len. 21]: Naturally then she would turn more to Alister , and his love was a strengthening tonic to her sick motherhood .
Parsing [sent. 1024 len. 7]: He was never jealous of either .
Parsing [sent. 1025 len. 11]: Their love for each other was to him a love .
Parsing [sent. 1026 len. 23]: He too would mourn deeply over his brother 's departure , but it became at once his business to comfort his mother .
Parsing [sent. 1027 len. 49]: And while she had no suspicion of the degree to which he suffered , it drew her with fresh love to her elder born , and gave her renewal of the quiet satisfaction in him that was never absent , when she saw how he too missed Ian .
Parsing [sent. 1028 len. 16]: Their mutual affection was indeed as true and strong as a mother could desire it .
Parsing [sent. 1029 len. 44]: `` If such love , '' she said to herself , `` had appeared in the middle of its history instead of now at its close , the transmitted affection would have been enough to bind the clan together for centuries more ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1030 len. 29]: It was with a prelusive smile that shone on the mother 's heart like the opening of heaven , that Ian lowered his book to answer her question .
Parsing [sent. 1031 len. 22]: She had said -- `` Did you not feel the cold very much at St. Petersburg last winter , Ian ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1032 len. 12]: `` Yes , mother , at times , '' he answered .
Parsing [sent. 1033 len. 17]: `` But everybody wears fur ; the peasant his sheep-skin , the noble his silver fox .
Parsing [sent. 1034 len. 7]: They have to fight the cold !
Parsing [sent. 1035 len. 8]: Nose and toes are in constant danger .
Parsing [sent. 1036 len. 14]: Did I never tell you what happened to me once in that way ?
Parsing [sent. 1037 len. 9]: I do n't think I ever did ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1038 len. 10]: `` You never tell me anything , Ian ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1039 len. 12]: said his mother , looking at him with a loving sadness .
Parsing [sent. 1040 len. 27]: `` I was suddenly stopped in the street by what I took for an unheard-of insult : I actually thought my great proboscis was being pulled !
Parsing [sent. 1041 len. 25]: If I had been as fiery as Alister , the man would have found his back , and I should have lost my nose .
Parsing [sent. 1042 len. 38]: Without the least warning a handful of snow was thrust in my face , and my nose had not even a chance of snorting with indignation , it found itself so twisted in every direction at once !
Parsing [sent. 1043 len. 89]: But I have a way , in any sudden occurrence , of feeling perplexed enough to want to be sure before doing anything , and if it has sometimes hindered me from what was expedient , it has oftener saved me from what would have been wrong : in another instant I was able to do justice to the promptitude of a fellow Christian for the preservation of my nose , already whitening in frosty death : he was rubbing it hard with snow , the orthodox remedy !
Parsing [sent. 1044 len. 26]: My whole face presently sharpened into one burning spot , and taking off my hat , I thanked the man for his most kind attention .
Parsing [sent. 1045 len. 34]: He pointed out to me that time spent in explaining the condition of my nose , would have been pure loss : the danger was pressing , and he attacked it at once !
Parsing [sent. 1046 len. 19]: I was indeed entirely unconscious of the state of my beak -- the worst symptom of any ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1047 len. 15]: `` I trust , Ian , you will not go back to Russia ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1048 len. 12]: said his mother , after a little more talk about frost-biting .
Parsing [sent. 1049 len. 11]: `` Surely there is work for you at home ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1050 len. 10]: `` What can I do at home , mother ?
Parsing [sent. 1051 len. 19]: You have no money to buy me a commission , and I am not much good at farm-work .
Parsing [sent. 1052 len. 12]: Alister says I am not worth a horseman 's wages ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1053 len. 16]: `` You could find teaching at home ; or you could go into the church .
Parsing [sent. 1054 len. 17]: We might manage that , for you would only have to attend the divinity classes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1055 len. 3]: `` Mother !
Parsing [sent. 1056 len. 20]: would you put me into one of the priests ' offices that I may eat a piece of bread ?
Parsing [sent. 1057 len. 24]: As for teaching , there are too many hungry students for that : I could not take the bread out of their mouths !
Parsing [sent. 1058 len. 19]: And in truth , mother , I could not endure it -- except it were required of me .
Parsing [sent. 1059 len. 17]: I can live on as little as any , but it must be with some liberty .
Parsing [sent. 1060 len. 20]: I have surely inherited the spirit of some old sea-rover , it is so difficult for me to rest !
Parsing [sent. 1061 len. 8]: I am a very thistle-down for wandering !
Parsing [sent. 1062 len. 8]: I must know how my fellow-creatures live !
Parsing [sent. 1063 len. 18]: I should like to BE one man after another -- each for an hour or two ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1064 len. 16]: `` Your father used to say there was much Norse blood in the family . ''
Parsing [sent. 1065 len. 7]: `` There it is , mother !
Parsing [sent. 1066 len. 7]: I can not help it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1067 len. 21]: `` I do n't like your holding the Czar 's commission , Ian -- somehow I do n't like it !
Parsing [sent. 1068 len. 6]: He is a tyrant ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1069 len. 12]: `` I am going to throw it up , mother . ''
Parsing [sent. 1070 len. 7]: `` I am glad of that !
Parsing [sent. 1071 len. 8]: How did you ever get it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1072 len. 12]: `` Oddly enough , through the man that pulled my nose .
Parsing [sent. 1073 len. 38]: I had a chance afterwards of doing him a good turn , which he was most generous in acknowledging ; and as he belonged to the court , I had the offer of a lieutenant 's commission .
Parsing [sent. 1074 len. 7]: The Scotch are in favour . ''
Parsing [sent. 1075 len. 13]: A deep cloud had settled on the face of the young man .
Parsing [sent. 1076 len. 25]: The lady looked at him for a moment with keenest mother-eyes , suppressed a deep sigh , and betook herself again to her work .
Parsing [sent. 1077 len. 16]: Ere she thought how he might take it , another question broke from her lips .
Parsing [sent. 1078 len. 17]: `` What sort of church had you to go to in St. Petersburg , Ian ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1079 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 1080 len. 23]: Ian was silent a moment , thinking how to be true , and not hurt her more than could not be helped .
Parsing [sent. 1081 len. 21]: `` There are a thousand places of worship there , mother , '' he returned , with a curious smile .
Parsing [sent. 1082 len. 6]: `` Any presbyterian place ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1083 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 1084 len. 9]: `` I believe so , '' he replied .
Parsing [sent. 1085 len. 11]: `` Ian , you have n't given up praying ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1086 len. 17]: `` If ever I prayed , mother , I certainly have not given it up . ''
Parsing [sent. 1087 len. 6]: `` Ever prayed , Ian !
Parsing [sent. 1088 len. 12]: When a mere child you prayed like an aged Christian ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1089 len. 11]: `` Ah , mother , that was a sad pity !
Parsing [sent. 1090 len. 11]: I asked for things of which I felt no need !
Parsing [sent. 1091 len. 5]: I was a hypocrite !
Parsing [sent. 1092 len. 11]: I ought to have prayed like a little child ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1093 len. 24]: The mother was silent : she it was who had taught him to pray thus -- making him pray aloud in her hearing !
Parsing [sent. 1094 len. 6]: and this was the result !
Parsing [sent. 1095 len. 6]: The premature blossom had withered !
Parsing [sent. 1096 len. 5]: she said to herself .
Parsing [sent. 1097 len. 11]: But it was no blossom , only a muslin flower !
Parsing [sent. 1098 len. 10]: `` Then you did n't go to church ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1099 len. 5]: she said at length .
Parsing [sent. 1100 len. 11]: `` Not often , mother dear , '' he answered .
Parsing [sent. 1101 len. 22]: `` When I do go , I like to go to the church of the country I happen to be in .
Parsing [sent. 1102 len. 14]: Going to church and praying to God are not the same thing . ''
Parsing [sent. 1103 len. 8]: `` Then you do say your prayers ?
Parsing [sent. 1104 len. 15]: Oh , do not tell me you never bow down before your maker ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1105 len. 18]: `` Shall I tell you where I think I did once pray to God , mother ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1106 len. 14]: he said , after a little pause , anxious to soothe her suffering .
Parsing [sent. 1107 len. 12]: `` At least I did think then that I prayed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1108 len. 3]: he added .
Parsing [sent. 1109 len. 16]: `` It was not this morning , then , before you left your chamber ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1110 len. 24]: `` No , mother , '' answered Ian ; `` I did not pray this morning , and I never say prayers . ''
Parsing [sent. 1111 len. 10]: The mother gave a gasp , but answered nothing .
Parsing [sent. 1112 len. 5]: Ian went on again .
Parsing [sent. 1113 len. 22]: `` I should like to tell you , mother , about that time when I am almost sure I prayed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1114 len. 19]: `` I should like to hear about it , '' she answered , with strangest minglings of emotion .
Parsing [sent. 1115 len. 43]: At one and the same instant she felt parted from her son by a gulf into which she must cast herself to find him , and that he stood on a height of sacred experience which she never could hope to climb .
Parsing [sent. 1116 len. 11]: `` Oh for his father to talk to him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1117 len. 5]: she said to herself .
Parsing [sent. 1118 len. 12]: He was a power on her soul which she almost feared .
Parsing [sent. 1119 len. 18]: If he were to put forth his power , might he not drag her down into unbelief ?
Parsing [sent. 1120 len. 14]: It was the first time they had come so close in their talk .
Parsing [sent. 1121 len. 11]: The moment his mother spoke out , Ian had responded .
Parsing [sent. 1122 len. 59]: He was anxious to be open with her so far as he could , and forced his natural taciturnity , the prime cause of which was his thoughtfulness : it was hard to talk where was so much thinking to be done , so little time to do it in , and so little progress made by it !
Parsing [sent. 1123 len. 16]: But wherever he could keep his mother company , there he would not leave her !
Parsing [sent. 1124 len. 38]: Just as he opened his mouth , however , to begin his narration , the door of the room also opened , flung wide by the small red hand of Nancy , and two young ladies entered .
Parsing [sent. 1125 len. 3]: CHAPTER VIII .
Parsing [sent. 1126 len. 4]: A MORNING CALL .
Parsing [sent. 1127 len. 50]: Had Valentine known who the brothers were , or where they lived , he would before now have called to thank them again for their kindness to him ; but he imagined they had some distance to go after depositing him , and had not yet discovered his mistake .
Parsing [sent. 1128 len. 11]: The visit now paid had nothing to do with him .
Parsing [sent. 1129 len. 47]: The two elder girls , curious about the pretty cottage , had come wandering down the spur , or hill-toe , as far as its precincts -- if precincts they may be called where was no fence , only a little grove and a less garden .
Parsing [sent. 1130 len. 21]: Beside the door stood a milk-pail and a churn , set out to be sweetened by the sun and wind .
Parsing [sent. 1131 len. 38]: It was very rural , they thought , and very homely , but not so attractive as some cottages in the south : -- it indicated a rusticity honoured by the most unceremonious visit from its superiors .
Parsing [sent. 1132 len. 32]: Thus without hesitation concluding , Christina , followed by Mercy , walked in at the open door , found a barefooted girl in the kitchen , and spoke pleasantly to her .
Parsing [sent. 1133 len. 44]: She , in simple hospitality forgetting herself , made answer in Gaelic ; and , never doubting the ladies had come to call upon her mistress , led the way , and the girls , without thinking , followed her to the parlour .
Parsing [sent. 1134 len. 9]: As they came , they had been talking .
Parsing [sent. 1135 len. 73]: Had they been in any degree truly educated , they would have been quite capable of an opinion of their own , for they had good enough faculties ; but they had never been really taught to read ; therefore , with the utmost confidence , they had been passing judgment upon a book from which they had not gathered the slightest notion as to the idea or intention of the writer .
Parsing [sent. 1136 len. 36]: Christina was of that numerous class of readers , who , if you show one thing better or worse than another , will without hesitation report that you love the one and hate the other .
Parsing [sent. 1137 len. 61]: If you say , for instance , that it is a worse and yet more shameful thing for a man to break his wife 's heart by systematic neglect , than to strike her and be sorry for it , such readers give out that you approve of wife-beating , and perhaps write to expostulate with you on your brutality .
Parsing [sent. 1138 len. 30]: If you express pleasure that a poor maniac should have succeeded in escaping through the door of death from his haunting demon , they accuse you of advocating suicide .
Parsing [sent. 1139 len. 19]: But Mercy was not yet afloat on the sea of essential LIE whereon Christina swung to every wave .
Parsing [sent. 1140 len. 50]: One question they had been discussing was , whether the hero of the story was worthy the name of lover , seeing he deferred offering his hand to the girl because she told her mother a FIB to account for her being with him in the garden after dark .
Parsing [sent. 1141 len. 23]: `` It was cowardly and unfair , '' said Christina : `` was it not for HIS sake she did it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1142 len. 11]: Mercy did not think to say `` WAS IT ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1143 len. 5]: as she well might .
Parsing [sent. 1144 len. 40]: `` Do n't you see , Chrissy , '' she said , `` he reasoned this way : ` If she tell her mother a lie , she may tell me a lie some day too ! ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1145 len. 47]: So indeed the youth did reason ; but it occurred to neither of his critics to note the fact that he would not have minded the girl 's telling her mother the lie , if he could have been certain she would never tell HIM one !
Parsing [sent. 1146 len. 43]: In regard to her hiding from him certain passages with another gentleman , occurring between this event and his proposal , Christina judged he had no right to know them , and if he had , their concealment was what he deserved .
Parsing [sent. 1147 len. 73]: When the girl , who would have thought it rude to ask their names -- if I mistake not , it was a point in highland hospitality to entertain without such inquiry -- led the way to the parlour , they followed expecting they did not know what : they had heard of the cowhouse , the stable , and even the pigsty , being under the same roof in these parts !
Parsing [sent. 1148 len. 72]: When the opening door disclosed `` lady '' Macruadh , every inch a chieftain 's widow , their conventional breeding failed them a little ; though incapable of recognizing a refinement beyond their own , they were not incapable of feeling its influence ; and they had not yet learned how to be rude with propriety in unproved circumstances -- still less how to be gracious without a moment 's notice .
Parsing [sent. 1149 len. 47]: But when a young man sprang from a couch , and the stately lady rose and advanced to receive them , it was too late to retreat , and for a moment they stood abashed , feeling , I am glad to say , like intruders .
Parsing [sent. 1150 len. 17]: The behaviour of the lady and gentleman , however , speedily set them partially at ease .
Parsing [sent. 1151 len. 51]: The latter , with movements more than graceful , for they were gracious , and altogether free of scroll-pattern or Polonius-flourish , placed chairs , and invited them to be seated , and the former began to talk as if their entrance were the least unexpected thing in the world .
Parsing [sent. 1152 len. 50]: Leaving them to explain their visit or not as they saw fit , she spoke of the weather , the harvest , the shooting ; feared the gentlemen would be disappointed : the birds were quite healthy , but not numerous -- they had too many enemies to multiply !
Parsing [sent. 1153 len. 32]: asked if they had seen the view from such and such a point ; -- in short , carried herself as one to whom cordiality to strangers was an easy duty .
Parsing [sent. 1154 len. 8]: But she was not taken with them .
Parsing [sent. 1155 len. 59]: Her order of civilization was higher than theirs ; and the simplicity as well as old-fashioned finish of her consciousness recoiled a little -- though she had not experience enough of a certain kind to be able at once to say what it was in the manner and expression of the young ladies that did not please her .
Parsing [sent. 1156 len. 41]: Mammon , gaining more and more of the upper hand in all social relations , has done much to lower the PETITE as well as the GRANDE MORALE of the country -- the good breeding as well as the honesty .
Parsing [sent. 1157 len. 18]: Unmannerliness with the completest self-possession , is a poor substitute for stiffness , a poorer for courtesy .
Parsing [sent. 1158 len. 25]: Respect and graciousness from each to each is of the very essence of Christianity , independently of rank , or possession , or relation .
Parsing [sent. 1159 len. 14]: A certain roughness and rudeness have usurped upon the intercourse of the century .
Parsing [sent. 1160 len. 24]: It comes of the spread of imagined greatness ; true greatness , unconscious of itself , can not find expression other than gracious .
Parsing [sent. 1161 len. 29]: In the presence of another , a man of true breeding is but faintly aware of his own self , and keenly aware of the other 's self .
Parsing [sent. 1162 len. 44]: Before the human -- that bush which , however trodden and peeled , yet burns with the divine presence -- the man who thinks of the homage due to him , and not of the homage owing by him , is essentially rude .
Parsing [sent. 1163 len. 23]: Mammon is slowly stifling and desiccating Rank ; both are miserable deities , but the one is yet meaner than the other .
Parsing [sent. 1164 len. 50]: Unrefined families with money are received with open arms and honours paid , in circles where a better breeding than theirs has hitherto prevailed : this , working along with the natural law of corruption where is no aspiration , has gradually caused the deterioration of which I speak .
Parsing [sent. 1165 len. 56]: Courtesy will never regain her former position , but she will be raised to a much higher ; like Duty she will be known as a daughter of the living God , `` the first stocke father of gentilnes ; '' for in his neighbour every man will see a revelation of the Most High .
Parsing [sent. 1166 len. 41]: Without being able to recognize the superiority of a woman who lived in a cottage , the young ladies felt and disliked it ; and the matron felt the commonness of the girls , without knowing what exactly it was .
Parsing [sent. 1167 len. 21]: The girls , on the other hand , were interested in the young man : he looked like a gentleman !
Parsing [sent. 1168 len. 36]: Ian was interested in the young women : he thought they were shy , when they were only `` put out , '' and wished to make them comfortable -- in which he quickly succeeded .
Parsing [sent. 1169 len. 52]: His unconsciously commanding air in the midst of his great courtesy , roused their admiration , and they had not been many minutes in his company ere they were satisfied that , however it was to be accounted for , the young man was in truth very much of a gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 1170 len. 20]: It was an unexpected discovery of northern produce , and `` the estate '' gathered interest in their eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1171 len. 18]: Christina did the greater part of the talking , hut both did their best to be agreeable .
Parsing [sent. 1172 len. 38]: Ian saw quite as well as his mother what ordinary girls they were , but , accustomed to the newer modes in manner and speech , he was not shocked by movements and phrases that annoyed her .
Parsing [sent. 1173 len. 15]: The mother apprehended fascination , and was uneasy , though far from showing it .
Parsing [sent. 1174 len. 25]: When they rose , Ian attended them to the door , leaving his mother anxious , for she feared he would accompany them home .
Parsing [sent. 1175 len. 11]: Till he returned , she did not resume her seat .
Parsing [sent. 1176 len. 27]: The girls took their way along the ridge in silence , till the ruin was between them and the cottage , when they burst into laughter .
Parsing [sent. 1177 len. 25]: They were ladies enough not to laugh till out of sight , but not ladies enough to see there was nothing to laugh at .
Parsing [sent. 1178 len. 7]: `` A harp , too ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1179 len. 3]: said Christina .
Parsing [sent. 1180 len. 31]: `` Mercy , I believe we are on the top of mount Ararat , and have this very moment left the real Noah 's ark , patched into a cottage !
Parsing [sent. 1181 len. 6]: Who CAN they be ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1182 len. 17]: `` Gentlefolk evidently , '' said Mercy , '' -- perhaps old-fashioned people from Inverness . ''
Parsing [sent. 1183 len. 10]: `` The young man must have been to college !
Parsing [sent. 1184 len. 37]: -- In the north , you know , '' continued Christina , thinking with pride that her brother was at Oxford , `` nothing is easier than to get an education , such as it is !
Parsing [sent. 1185 len. 8]: It costs in fact next to nothing .
Parsing [sent. 1186 len. 16]: Ploughmen send their sons to St. Andrew 's and Aberdeen to make gentlemen of them !
Parsing [sent. 1187 len. 3]: Fancy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1188 len. 11]: `` You must allow this case a successful one ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1189 len. 11]: `` I did n't mean HIS father was a ploughman !
Parsing [sent. 1190 len. 4]: That is impossible !
Parsing [sent. 1191 len. 12]: Besides , I heard him call that very respectable person MOTHER !
Parsing [sent. 1192 len. 18]: She is not a ploughman 's wife , but evidently a lady of the middle class . ''
Parsing [sent. 1193 len. 15]: Christina did not count herself or her people to belong to the middle class .
Parsing [sent. 1194 len. 62]: How it was it is not quite easy to say -- perhaps the tone of implied contempt with which the father spoke of the lower classes , and the quiet negation with which the mother would allude to shopkeepers , may have had to do with it -- but the young people all imagined themselves to belong to the upper classes !
Parsing [sent. 1195 len. 23]: It was a pity there was no title in the family -- but any of the girls might well marry a coronet !
Parsing [sent. 1196 len. 23]: There were indeed persons higher than they ; a duke was higher ; the queen was higher -- but that was pleasant !
Parsing [sent. 1197 len. 12]: it was nice to have a few to look up to !
Parsing [sent. 1198 len. 55]: On anyone living in a humble house , not to say a poor cottage , they looked down , as the case might be , with indifference or patronage ; they little dreamed how , had she known all about them , the respectable person in the cottage would have looked down upon THEM !
Parsing [sent. 1199 len. 35]: At the same time the laugh in which they now indulged was not altogether one of amusement ; it was in part an effort to avenge themselves of a certain uncomfortable feeling of rebuke .
Parsing [sent. 1200 len. 11]: `` I will tell you my theory , Mercy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1201 len. 4]: Christina went on .
Parsing [sent. 1202 len. 15]: `` The lady is the widow of an Indian officer -- perhaps a colonel .
Parsing [sent. 1203 len. 30]: Some of their widows are left very poor , though , their husbands having been in the service of their country , they think no small beer of themselves !
Parsing [sent. 1204 len. 41]: The young man has a military air which he may have got from his father ; or he may be an officer himself : young officers are always poor ; that 's what makes them so nice to flirt with .
Parsing [sent. 1205 len. 9]: I wonder whether he really IS an officer !
Parsing [sent. 1206 len. 19]: We 've actually called upon the people , and come away too , without knowing their names ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1207 len. 11]: `` I suppose they 're from the New House ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1208 len. 33]: said Ian , returning after he had bowed the ladies from the threshold , with the reward of a bewitching smile from the elder , and a shy glance from the younger .
Parsing [sent. 1209 len. 9]: `` Where else could they be from ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1210 len. 16]: returned his mother ; '' -- come to make our poor country yet poorer ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1211 len. 7]: `` They 're not English ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1212 len. 4]: `` Not they !
Parsing [sent. 1213 len. 7]: -- vulgar people from Glasgow ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1214 len. 12]: `` I think you are too hard on them , mother !
Parsing [sent. 1215 len. 6]: They are not exactly vulgar .
Parsing [sent. 1216 len. 23]: I thought , indeed , there was a sort of gentleness about them you do not often meet in Scotch girls ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1217 len. 35]: `` In the lowlands , I grant , Ian ; but the daughter of the poorest tacksman of the Macruadhs has a manner and a modesty I have seen in no Sasunnach girl yet .
Parsing [sent. 1218 len. 6]: Those girls are bold ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1219 len. 6]: `` Self-possessed , perhaps ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1220 len. 3]: said Ian .
Parsing [sent. 1221 len. 13]: Upon the awkwardness he took for shyness , had followed a reaction .
Parsing [sent. 1222 len. 44]: It was with the young ladies a part of good breeding , whatever mistake they made , not to look otherwise than contented with themselves : having for a moment failed in this principle , they were eager to make up for it .
Parsing [sent. 1223 len. 17]: `` Girls are different from what they used to be , I fancy , mother ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1224 len. 4]: added Ian thoughtfully .
Parsing [sent. 1225 len. 8]: `` The world changes very fast ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1226 len. 5]: said the mother sadly .
Parsing [sent. 1227 len. 31]: She was thinking , like Rebecca , if her sons took a fancy to these who were not daughters of the land , what good would her life do her .
Parsing [sent. 1228 len. 43]: `` Ah , mother dear , '' said Ian , `` I have never '' -- and as he spoke the cloud deepened on his forehead -- `` seen more than one woman whose ways and manners reminded me of you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1229 len. 7]: `` And what was she ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1230 len. 8]: the mother asked , in pleased alarm .
Parsing [sent. 1231 len. 18]: But she almost repented the question when she saw how low the cloud descended on his countenance .
Parsing [sent. 1232 len. 6]: `` A princess , mother .
Parsing [sent. 1233 len. 27]: She is dead , '' he answered , and turning walked so gently from the room that it was impossible for his mother to detain him .
Parsing [sent. 1234 len. 3]: CHAPTER IX .
Parsing [sent. 1235 len. 2]: ME .
Parsing [sent. 1236 len. 2]: SERCOMBE .
Parsing [sent. 1237 len. 16]: The next morning , soon after sunrise , the laird began to cut his barley .
Parsing [sent. 1238 len. 20]: Ian would gladly have helped , but Alister had a notion that such labour was not fit for him .
Parsing [sent. 1239 len. 20]: `` I had a comical interview this morning , '' said the chief , entering the kitchen at dinner-time .
Parsing [sent. 1240 len. 28]: `` I was out before my people , and was standing by the burn-side near the foot-bridge , when I heard somebody shouting , and looked up .
Parsing [sent. 1241 len. 24]: There was a big English fellow in gray on the top of the ridge , with his gun on his shoulder , hollo-ing .
Parsing [sent. 1242 len. 9]: I knew he was English by his hollo-ing .
Parsing [sent. 1243 len. 24]: It was plain it was to me , but not choosing to be at his beck and call , I took no heed .
Parsing [sent. 1244 len. 6]: ` Hullo , you there !
Parsing [sent. 1245 len. 4]: wake up ! '
Parsing [sent. 1246 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 1247 len. 9]: ` What should I wake up for ? '
Parsing [sent. 1248 len. 3]: I returned .
Parsing [sent. 1249 len. 6]: ` To carry my bag .
Parsing [sent. 1250 len. 10]: You do n't seem to have anything to do !
Parsing [sent. 1251 len. 9]: I 'll give you five shillings . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 1252 len. 15]: `` You see to what you expose yourself by your unconventlonalities , Alister ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1253 len. 8]: said his brother , with rnock gravity .
Parsing [sent. 1254 len. 22]: `` It was not the fellow we carried home the other night , Ian ; it was one twice his size .
Parsing [sent. 1255 len. 13]: It would take all I have to carry HIM as far ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1256 len. 12]: `` The other must have pointed you out to him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1257 len. 14]: `` It was much too dark for him to know me again ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1258 len. 7]: `` You forget the hall-lamp ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1259 len. 3]: said Ian .
Parsing [sent. 1260 len. 9]: `` Ah , yes , to be sure !
Parsing [sent. 1261 len. 5]: I had forgotten ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1262 len. 3]: answered Alister .
Parsing [sent. 1263 len. 52]: `` To tell the truth , I thought , when I took his shilling , he would never know me from Nebuchadnezzar : that is the one thing I am ashamed of in the affair -- I did in the dark what perhaps I should not have done in the daylight !
Parsing [sent. 1264 len. 16]: -- I do n't mean I would not have carried him and his bag too !
Parsing [sent. 1265 len. 7]: I refer only to the shilling !
Parsing [sent. 1266 len. 28]: Now , of course , I will hold my face to it ; but I thought it better to be short with a fellow like that . ''
Parsing [sent. 1267 len. 5]: `` Well ? '' ''
Parsing [sent. 1268 len. 10]: ` You 'll want prepayment , no doubt ! '
Parsing [sent. 1269 len. 11]: he went on , putting his hand in his pocket .
Parsing [sent. 1270 len. 16]: Those Sasunnach fellows think every highlandman keen as a hawk after their dirty money ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1271 len. 12]: `` They have but too good reason in some parts ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1272 len. 4]: said the mother .
Parsing [sent. 1273 len. 19]: `` It is not so bad here yet , but there is a great difference in that respect .
Parsing [sent. 1274 len. 7]: The old breed is fast disappearing .
Parsing [sent. 1275 len. 30]: What with the difficulty of living by the hardest work , and the occasional chance of earning a shilling easily , many have turned both idle and greedy . ''
Parsing [sent. 1276 len. 12]: `` That 's for you and your shilling , Alister ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1277 len. 3]: said Ian .
Parsing [sent. 1278 len. 31]: `` I confess , '' returned Alister , `` if I had foreseen what an idea of the gentlemen of the country I might give , I should have hesitated .
Parsing [sent. 1279 len. 11]: But I have n't begun to be ashamed yet ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1280 len. 6]: `` Ashamed , Alister ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1281 len. 3]: cried Ian .
Parsing [sent. 1282 len. 15]: `` What does it matter what a fellow like that thinks of you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1283 len. 9]: `` And mistress Conal has her shilling ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1284 len. 4]: said the mother .
Parsing [sent. 1285 len. 32]: `` If the thing was right , '' pursued Ian , `` no harm can come of it ; if it was not right , no end of harm may come .
Parsing [sent. 1286 len. 16]: Are you sure it was good for mistress Conal to have that shilling , Alister ?
Parsing [sent. 1287 len. 20]: What if it be drawing away her heart from him who is watching his old child in her turf-hut ?
Parsing [sent. 1288 len. 14]: What if the devil be grinning at her from , that shilling ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1289 len. 3]: `` Ian !
Parsing [sent. 1290 len. 21]: if God had not meant her to have the shilling , he would not have let Alister earn it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1291 len. 13]: `` Certainly God can take care of her from a shilling ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1292 len. 11]: said Ian , with one of his strangely sweet smiles .
Parsing [sent. 1293 len. 10]: `` I was only trying Alister , mother . ''
Parsing [sent. 1294 len. 45]: `` I confess I did not like the thought of it at first , '' resumed Mrs. Macruadh ; `` but it was mere pride ; for when I thought of your father , I knew he would have been pleased with Alister . ''
Parsing [sent. 1295 len. 30]: `` Then , mother , I am glad ; and I do n't care what Ian , or any Sasunnach under the sun , may think of me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1296 len. 19]: `` But you have n't told us , '' said Ian , `` how the thing ended . ''
Parsing [sent. 1297 len. 30]: `` I said to the fellow , '' resumed Alister , `` that I had my shearing to do , and had n't the time to go with him .
Parsing [sent. 1298 len. 9]: ` Is this your season for sheep-shearing ? '
Parsing [sent. 1299 len. 3]: said he .
Parsing [sent. 1300 len. 24]: ` We call cutting the corn shearing , ' I answered , ` because in these parts we use the reaping hook . '
Parsing [sent. 1301 len. 10]: ` That is a great waste of labour ! '
Parsing [sent. 1302 len. 3]: he returned .
Parsing [sent. 1303 len. 17]: I did not tell him that some of our land would smash his machines like toys .
Parsing [sent. 1304 len. 4]: ` How ? '
Parsing [sent. 1305 len. 3]: I asked .
Parsing [sent. 1306 len. 11]: ` It costs so much more , ' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1307 len. 9]: ` But it feeds so many more ! '
Parsing [sent. 1308 len. 3]: I replied .
Parsing [sent. 1309 len. 21]: ` Oh yes , of course , if you do n't want the farmer to make a living ! ' '
Parsing [sent. 1310 len. 11]: I manage to make a living , ' I said .
Parsing [sent. 1311 len. 8]: ` Then you are the farmer ? '
Parsing [sent. 1312 len. 8]: ` So it would appear . ' '
Parsing [sent. 1313 len. 31]: I beg your pardon ; I thought -- ' ` You thought I was an idle fellow , glad of an easy job to keep the life in me ! '
Parsing [sent. 1314 len. 17]: ` You were deuced glad of a job the other night , they tell me ! '
Parsing [sent. 1315 len. 5]: ` So I was .
Parsing [sent. 1316 len. 28]: I wanted a shilling for a poor woman , and had n't one to give her without going home a mile and a half for it ! '
Parsing [sent. 1317 len. 27]: By this time he had come down , and I had gone a few steps to meet him ; I did not want to seem unfriendly .
Parsing [sent. 1318 len. 12]: ` Upon my word , it was very good of you !
Parsing [sent. 1319 len. 9]: The old lady ought to be grateful ! '
Parsing [sent. 1320 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 1321 len. 29]: ` So ought we all , ' I answered , ' -- I to your friend for the shilling , and he to me for taking his bag .
Parsing [sent. 1322 len. 22]: He did me one good turn for my poor woman , and I did him another for his poor leg ! '
Parsing [sent. 1323 len. 7]: ` So you 're quits ! '
Parsing [sent. 1324 len. 3]: said he .
Parsing [sent. 1325 len. 22]: ` Not at all , ' I answered ; ` on the contrary , we are under mutual obligation . ' '
Parsing [sent. 1326 len. 7]: I do n't see the difference !
Parsing [sent. 1327 len. 9]: -- Hillo , there 's a hare ! '
Parsing [sent. 1328 len. 9]: And up went his gun to his shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 1329 len. 6]: ` None of that ! '
Parsing [sent. 1330 len. 9]: I cried , and knocked up the barrel .
Parsing [sent. 1331 len. 7]: ` What do you mean ? '
Parsing [sent. 1332 len. 6]: he roared , looking furious .
Parsing [sent. 1333 len. 14]: ` Get out of the way , or I 'll shoot you . '
Parsing [sent. 1334 len. 8]: ` Murder as well as poaching ! '
Parsing [sent. 1335 len. 3]: I said .
Parsing [sent. 1336 len. 4]: ` Poaching ! '
Parsing [sent. 1337 len. 3]: he shouted .
Parsing [sent. 1338 len. 19]: ` That rabbit is mine , ' I answered ; ' I will not have it killed . '
Parsing [sent. 1339 len. 3]: ` Cool !
Parsing [sent. 1340 len. 8]: -- on Mr. Palmer 's land ! '
Parsing [sent. 1341 len. 3]: said he .
Parsing [sent. 1342 len. 14]: ` The land is mine , and I am my own gamekeeper ! '
Parsing [sent. 1343 len. 3]: I rejoined .
Parsing [sent. 1344 len. 7]: ` You look like it ! '
Parsing [sent. 1345 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 1346 len. 7]: ` You go after your birds !
Parsing [sent. 1347 len. 18]: -- not in this direction though , ' I answered , and turned and left him . ''
Parsing [sent. 1348 len. 8]: `` You were rough with him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1349 len. 3]: said Ian .
Parsing [sent. 1350 len. 9]: `` I did lose my temper rather . ''
Parsing [sent. 1351 len. 10]: `` It was a mistake on his part . ''
Parsing [sent. 1352 len. 27]: `` I expected to hear him fire , '' Alister continued , `` for there was the rabbit he took for a hare lurching slowly away !
Parsing [sent. 1353 len. 15]: I 'm glad he did n't : I always feel bad after a row !
Parsing [sent. 1354 len. 12]: -- Can a conscience ever get too fastidious , Ian ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1355 len. 15]: `` The only way to find that out is always to obey it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1356 len. 13]: `` So long as it agrees with the Bible , Ian ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1357 len. 4]: interposed the mother .
Parsing [sent. 1358 len. 24]: `` The Bible is a big book , mother , and the things in it are of many sorts , '' returned Ian .
Parsing [sent. 1359 len. 13]: `` The Lord did not go with every thing in it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1360 len. 3]: `` Ian !
Parsing [sent. 1361 len. 2]: Ian !
Parsing [sent. 1362 len. 8]: I am shocked to hear you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1363 len. 9]: `` It is the truth , mother . ''
Parsing [sent. 1364 len. 9]: `` What WOULD your father say ! '' ''
Parsing [sent. 1365 len. 18]: ` He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 1366 len. 19]: Ian rose from the table , knelt by his mother , and laid his head on her shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 1367 len. 25]: She was silent , pained by his words , and put her arm round him as if to shelter him from the evil one .
Parsing [sent. 1368 len. 29]: Homage to will and word of the Master , apart from the acceptance of certain doctrines concerning him , was in her eyes not merely defective but dangerous .
Parsing [sent. 1369 len. 35]: To love the Lord with the love of truest obedience ; to believe him the son of God and the saver of men with absolute acceptance of the heart , was far from enough !
Parsing [sent. 1370 len. 6]: it was but sentimental affection !
Parsing [sent. 1371 len. 35]: A certain young preacher in Scotland some years ago , accused by an old lady of preaching works , took refuge in the Lord 's sermon on the mount : `` Ow ay ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1372 len. 19]: answered the partisan , `` but he was a varra yoong mon whan he preacht that sermon ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1373 len. 21]: Alister rose and went : there was to him something specially sacred in the communion of his mother and brother .
Parsing [sent. 1374 len. 15]: Heartily he held with Ian , but shrank from any difference with his mother .
Parsing [sent. 1375 len. 53]: For her sake he received Sunday after Sunday in silence what was to him a bushel of dust with here and there a bit of mouldy bread in it ; but the mother did not imagine any great coincidence of opinion between her and Alister any more than between her and Ian .
Parsing [sent. 1376 len. 24]: She had not the faintest notion how much genuine faith both of them had , or how it surpassed her own in vitality .
Parsing [sent. 1377 len. 47]: But while Ian seemed to his brother , who knew him best , hardly touched with earthly stain , Alister , notwithstanding his large and dominant humanity , was still in the troublous condition of one trying to do right against a powerful fermentation of pride .
Parsing [sent. 1378 len. 19]: He held noblest principles ; but the sediment of generations was too easily stirred up to cloud them .
Parsing [sent. 1379 len. 26]: He was not quite honest in his attitude towards some of his ancestors , judging them far more leniently than he would have judged others .
Parsing [sent. 1380 len. 19]: He loved his neighbour , but his neighbour was mostly of his own family or his own clan .
Parsing [sent. 1381 len. 41]: He MIGHT have been unjust for the sake of his own -- a small fault in the eyes of the world , but a great fault indeed in a nature like his , capable of being so much beyond it .
Parsing [sent. 1382 len. 58]: For , while the faults of a good man can not be such evil things as the faults of a bad man , they are more blameworthy , and greater faults than the same would be in a bad man : we must not confuse the guilt of the person with the abstract evil of the thing .
Parsing [sent. 1383 len. 16]: Ian was one of those blessed few who doubt in virtue of a larger faith .
Parsing [sent. 1384 len. 53]: While its roots were seeking a deeper soil , it could not show so fast a growth above ground , He doubted most about the things he loved best , while he devoted the energies of a mind whose keenness almost masked its power , to discover possible ways of believing them .
Parsing [sent. 1385 len. 21]: To the wise his doubts would have been his best credentials ; they were worth tenfold the faith of most .
Parsing [sent. 1386 len. 13]: It was truth , and higher truth , he was always seeking .
Parsing [sent. 1387 len. 22]: The sadness which coloured his deepest individuality , only one thing could ever remove -- the conscious presence of the Eternal .
Parsing [sent. 1388 len. 12]: This is true of all sadness , but Ian knew it .
Parsing [sent. 1389 len. 10]: He overtook Alister on his way to the barley-field .
Parsing [sent. 1390 len. 27]: `` I have been trying to find out wherein lay the falseness of the position in which you found yourself this morning , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1391 len. 45]: `` There could be nothing wrong in doing a small thing for its reward any more than a great one ; where I think you went wrong was in ASSUMING your social position afterwards : you should have waited for its being accorded you .
Parsing [sent. 1392 len. 11]: There was no occasion to be offended with the man .
Parsing [sent. 1393 len. 17]: You ought to have seen how you must look to him , and given him time .
Parsing [sent. 1394 len. 21]: I do n't perceive why you should be so gracious to old mistress Conal , and so hard upon him .
Parsing [sent. 1395 len. 33]: Certainly you would not speak as he did to any man , but he has been brought up differently ; he is not such a gentleman as you can not help being .
Parsing [sent. 1396 len. 22]: In a word , you ought to have treated him as an inferior , and been more polite to him . ''
Parsing [sent. 1397 len. 3]: CHAPTER X .
Parsing [sent. 1398 len. 3]: THE PLOUGH-BULLS .
Parsing [sent. 1399 len. 38]: Partly , it may be , from such incidents at the outset of their acquaintance , there was for some time no further meeting betwixt any of the chief 's family and that of the new laird .
Parsing [sent. 1400 len. 12]: There was indeed little to draw them together except common isolation .
Parsing [sent. 1401 len. 49]: Valentine would have been pleased to show gratitude to his helpers on that stormy night , but after his sisters ' account of their call , he felt not only ashamed , which was right , but ashamed to show his shame , which was a fresh shame .
Parsing [sent. 1402 len. 42]: The girls on their part made so much of what they counted the ridiculous elements of their `` adventure , '' that , natural vengeance on their untruthfulness , they came themselves to see in it almost only what was ridiculous .
Parsing [sent. 1403 len. 29]: In the same spirit Mr. Sercombe recounted his adventure with Alister , which annoyed his host , who had but little acquaintance with the boundaries of his land .
Parsing [sent. 1404 len. 45]: From the additional servants they had hired in the vicinity , the people of the New House gathered correct information concerning the people at the cottage , but the honour in which they were held only added to the ridicule they associated with them .
Parsing [sent. 1405 len. 15]: On the other side also there was little inclination towards a pursuit of intercourse .
Parsing [sent. 1406 len. 38]: Mrs. Macruadh , from Nancy 's account and the behaviour of the girls , divined the explanation of their visit ; and , as their mother did not follow it up , took no notice of it .
Parsing [sent. 1407 len. 44]: In the mind of Mercy , however , lurked a little thorn , with the bluntest possible sting of suspicion , every time she joined in a laugh at the people of the cottage , that she was not quite just to them .
Parsing [sent. 1408 len. 23]: The shooting , such as it was , went on , the sleeping and the eating , the walking and the talking .
Parsing [sent. 1409 len. 45]: Long letters were written from the New House to female friends -- letters with the flourishes if not the matter of wit , and funny tales concerning the natives , whom , because of their poor houses and unintelligibility , they represented as semi-savages .
Parsing [sent. 1410 len. 23]: The young men went back to Oxford ; and the time for the return of the family to civilization seemed drawing nigh .
Parsing [sent. 1411 len. 61]: It happened about this time , however , that a certain speculation in which Mr. Peregrine Palmer was very materially interested , failed utterly , depriving him of the consciousness of a good many thousands , and producing in him the feeling of a lady of moderate means when she loses her purse : he must save it off something !
Parsing [sent. 1412 len. 33]: For though he spent freely , he placed a great value on money -- as well he might , seeing it gave him all the distinction which before everything else he prized .
Parsing [sent. 1413 len. 24]: He did not know what a poor thing it is to be distinguished among men , therefore did not like losing his thousands .
Parsing [sent. 1414 len. 43]: Having by failure sinned against Mammon , he must do something to ease the money-conscience that ruled his conduct ; and the first thing that occurred to him was , to leave his wife and daughters where they were for the winter .
Parsing [sent. 1415 len. 45]: None of them were in the least delicate ; his wife professed herself fond of a country life ; it would give the girls a good opportunity for practice , drawing , and study generally , and he would find them a suitable governess !
Parsing [sent. 1416 len. 9]: He talked the matter over with Mrs. Palmer .
Parsing [sent. 1417 len. 11]: She did not mind much , and would not object .
Parsing [sent. 1418 len. 20]: He would spend Christmas with them , he said , and bring down Christian , and perhaps Mr. Sercombe .
Parsing [sent. 1419 len. 8]: The girls did not like the idea .
Parsing [sent. 1420 len. 18]: It was so cold in the country in winter , and the snow would be so deep !
Parsing [sent. 1421 len. 7]: they would be starved to death !
Parsing [sent. 1422 len. 17]: But , of course -- if the governor had made up his mind to be cruel !
Parsing [sent. 1423 len. 5]: The thing was settled .
Parsing [sent. 1424 len. 7]: It was only for one winter !
Parsing [sent. 1425 len. 20]: It would be a new experience for them , and they would enjoy their next SEASON all the more !
Parsing [sent. 1426 len. 18]: The governor had promised to send them down new furs , and a great boxful of novels !
Parsing [sent. 1427 len. 13]: He did not apprise them that he meant to sell their horses .
Parsing [sent. 1428 len. 5]: Their horses were his !
Parsing [sent. 1429 len. 21]: He was an indulgent father and did not stint them , but he was not going to ask their leave !
Parsing [sent. 1430 len. 13]: At the same time he had not the courage to tell them .
Parsing [sent. 1431 len. 30]: He took his wife with him as far as Inverness for a day or two , that she might lay in a good stock of everything antagonistic to cold .
Parsing [sent. 1432 len. 15]: When father and mother were gone from the house , the girls felt LARKY .
Parsing [sent. 1433 len. 36]: They had no wish to do anything they would not do if their parents were at home , but they had some sense of relief in the thought that they could do whatever they liked .
Parsing [sent. 1434 len. 39]: A more sympathetic historian might say , and I am nowise inclined to contradict him , that it was only the reaction from the pain of parting , and the instinct to make the best of their loneliness .
Parsing [sent. 1435 len. 66]: However it was , the elder girls resolved on a walk to the village , to see what might be seen , and in particular the young woman at the shop , of whom they had heard their brother and Mr. Sercombe speak with admiration , qualified with the remark that she was so proper they could hardly get a civil word out of her .
Parsing [sent. 1436 len. 11]: She was in fact too scrupulously polite for their taste .
Parsing [sent. 1437 len. 19]: It was a bright , pleasant , frosty morning , perfectly still , with an air like wine .
Parsing [sent. 1438 len. 8]: The harvest had vanished from the fields .
Parsing [sent. 1439 len. 14]: The sun shone on millions of tiny dew-suns , threaded on forsaken spider-webs .
Parsing [sent. 1440 len. 12]: A few small , white , frozen clouds flecked the sky .
Parsing [sent. 1441 len. 19]: The purple heather was not yet gone , and not any snow had yet fallen in the valley .
Parsing [sent. 1442 len. 28]: The burn was large , for there had been a good deal of rain , but it was not much darker than its usual brown of smoke-crystal .
Parsing [sent. 1443 len. 5]: They tripped gaily along .
Parsing [sent. 1444 len. 26]: If they had little spiritual , they had much innocent animal life , which no great disappointments or keen twinges of conscience had yet damped .
Parsing [sent. 1445 len. 13]: They were hut human kittens -- and not of the finest breed .
Parsing [sent. 1446 len. 33]: As they crossed the root of the spur , and looked down on the autumn fields to the east of it , they spied something going on which they did not understand .
Parsing [sent. 1447 len. 27]: Stopping , and gazing more intently , they beheld what seemed a contest between man and beast , but its nature they could not yet distinguish .
Parsing [sent. 1448 len. 22]: Gradually it grew plain that two of the cattle of the country , wild and shaggy , were rebelling against control .
Parsing [sent. 1449 len. 67]: They were in fact two young bulls , of the small black highland breed , accustomed to gallop over the rough hills , jumping like goats , which Alister had set himself the task of breaking to the plough -- by no means an easy one , or to be accomplished single-handed by any but a man of some strength , and both persistence and patience .
Parsing [sent. 1450 len. 46]: In the summer he had lost a horse , which he could ill afford to replace : if he could make these bulls work , they would save him the price of the horse , would cost less to keep , and require less attention !
Parsing [sent. 1451 len. 87]: He bridled them by the nose , not with rings through the gristle , but with nose-bands of iron , bluntly spiked inside , against which they could not pull hard without pain , and had made some progress , though he could by no means trust them yet : every now and then a fit of mingled wildness and stubbornness would seize them , and the contest would appear about to begin again from the beginning ; but they seldom now held out very long .
Parsing [sent. 1452 len. 48]: The nose-band of one of them had come off , Alister had him by a horn in each hand , and a fierce struggle was going on between them , while the other was pulling away from his companion as if determined to take to the hills .
Parsing [sent. 1453 len. 42]: It was a good thing for them that share and coulter were pretty deep in the ground , to the help of their master ; for had they got away , they would have killed , or at least disabled themselves .
Parsing [sent. 1454 len. 55]: Presently , however , he had the nose-band on , and by force and persuasion together got the better of them ; the staggy little furies gave in ; and quickly gathering up his reins , he went back to the plough-stilts , where each hand held at once a handle and a rein .
Parsing [sent. 1455 len. 32]: With energetic obedience the , little animals began to pull -- so vigorously that it took nearly all the chief 's strength to hold at once his plough and his team .
Parsing [sent. 1456 len. 16]: It was something of a sight to the girls after a long dearth of events .
Parsing [sent. 1457 len. 26]: Many things indeed upon which they scarce cast an eye when they came , they were now capable of regarding with a little feeble interest .
Parsing [sent. 1458 len. 43]: Nor , although ignorant of everything agricultural , were they quite unused to animals ; having horses they called their own , they would not unfrequently go to the stables to give their orders , or see that they were carried out .
Parsing [sent. 1459 len. 53]: They waited for some time hoping the fight would begin again , and drew a little nearer ; then , as by common consent , left the road , passed the ruin , ran down the steep side of the ridge , and began to toil through the stubble towards the ploughman .
Parsing [sent. 1460 len. 37]: A sharp straw would every now and then go through a delicate stocking , and the damp soil gathered in great lumps on their shoes , but they plodded on , laughing merrily as they went .
Parsing [sent. 1461 len. 27]: The Macruadh was meditating the power of the frost to break up the clods of the field , when he saw the girls close to him .
Parsing [sent. 1462 len. 43]: He pulled in his cattle , and taking off his bonnet with one hand while the other held both reins -- `` Excuse me , ladies , '' he said ; `` my animals are young , and not quite broken . ''
Parsing [sent. 1463 len. 25]: They were not a little surprised at such a reception , and were driven to conclude that the man must be the laird himself .
Parsing [sent. 1464 len. 22]: They had heard that he cultivated his own land , but had not therefore imagined him labouring in his own person .
Parsing [sent. 1465 len. 30]: In spite of the blindness produced by their conventional training , vulgarly called education , they could not fail to perceive something in the man worthy of their regard .
Parsing [sent. 1466 len. 37]: Before them , on the alert toward his cattle , but full of courtesy , stood a dark , handsome , weather-browned man , with an eagle air , not so pronounced as his brother 's .
Parsing [sent. 1467 len. 22]: His hair was long , and almost black , -- in thick , soft curls over a small , well-set head .
Parsing [sent. 1468 len. 34]: His glance had the flash that comes of victorious effort , and his free carriage was that of one whom labour has nowise subdued , whose every muscle is instinct with ready life .
Parsing [sent. 1469 len. 36]: True even in trifles , he wore the dark beard that nature had given him ; disordered by the struggle with his bulls , it imparted a certain wild look that contrasted with his speech .
Parsing [sent. 1470 len. 57]: Christina forgot that the man was a labourer like any other , but noted that he did not manifest the least embarrassment in their presence , or any consciousness of a superfluity of favour in their approach : she did not know that neither would his hired servant , or the poorest member of his clan .
Parsing [sent. 1471 len. 36]: It was said of a certain Sutherland clan that they were all gentlemen , and of a certain Argyll clan that they were all poets ; of the Macruadhs it was said they were both .
Parsing [sent. 1472 len. 30]: As to Mercy , the first glance of the chiefs hazel eyes , looking straight into hers with genial respect , went deeper than any look had yet penetrated .
Parsing [sent. 1473 len. 11]: Ladies in Alister 's fields were not an everyday sight .
Parsing [sent. 1474 len. 28]: Hardly before had his work been enlivened by such a presence ; and the joy of it was in his eyes , though his behaviour was calm .
Parsing [sent. 1475 len. 55]: Christina thought how pleasant it would be to have him for a worshipping slave -- so interpenetrated with her charms that , like Una 's lion , he would crouch at her feet , come and go at her pleasure , live on her smiles , and be sad when she gave him none .
Parsing [sent. 1476 len. 16]: She would make a gentleman of him , then leave him to dream of her !
Parsing [sent. 1477 len. 29]: It would be a pleasant and interesting task in the dullness of their winter 's banishment , with the days so short and the nights so unendurably long !
Parsing [sent. 1478 len. 5]: The man was handsome !
Parsing [sent. 1479 len. 6]: -- she would do it !
Parsing [sent. 1480 len. 13]: -- and would proceed at once to initiate the conquest of him !
Parsing [sent. 1481 len. 42]: The temptation to patronize not unfrequently presents an object for the patronage superior to the would-be patron ; for the temptation is one to which slight persons chiefly are exposed ; it affords an outlet for the vague activity of self-importance .
Parsing [sent. 1482 len. 16]: Few have learned that one is of no value except to God and other men .
Parsing [sent. 1483 len. 26]: Miss Palmer worshipped herself , and therefore would fain be worshipped -- so dreamed of a friendship de haut en bas with the country fellow .
Parsing [sent. 1484 len. 17]: She put on a smile -- no difficult thing , for she was a good-natured girl .
Parsing [sent. 1485 len. 7]: It looked to Alister quite natural .
Parsing [sent. 1486 len. 15]: It was nevertheless , like Hamlet 's false friends , `` sent for . ''
Parsing [sent. 1487 len. 7]: `` Do you like ploughing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1488 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 1489 len. 22]: Had she known the manners of the country , she would have added `` laird , '' or `` Macruadh . ''
Parsing [sent. 1490 len. 22]: `` Yes I do , '' Alister answered ; `` but I should plough all the same if I did not .
Parsing [sent. 1491 len. 7]: It has to be done . ''
Parsing [sent. 1492 len. 9]: `` But why should YOU do it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1493 len. 10]: `` Because I must , '' laughed the laird .
Parsing [sent. 1494 len. 6]: What ought she to answer ?
Parsing [sent. 1495 len. 12]: Should she condole with the man because he had to work ?
Parsing [sent. 1496 len. 6]: It did not seem prudent !
Parsing [sent. 1497 len. 6]: She would try another tack !
Parsing [sent. 1498 len. 9]: `` You had some trouble with your oxen !
Parsing [sent. 1499 len. 12]: We saw it from the road , and were quite frightened .
Parsing [sent. 1500 len. 8]: I hope you are not hurt . ''
Parsing [sent. 1501 len. 15]: `` There was no danger of that , '' answered Alister with a smile .
Parsing [sent. 1502 len. 7]: `` What wild creatures they are !
Parsing [sent. 1503 len. 9]: Ai n't it rather hard work for them ?
Parsing [sent. 1504 len. 6]: They are so small ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1505 len. 13]: `` They are as strong as horses , '' answered the laird .
Parsing [sent. 1506 len. 10]: `` I have had my work to break them !
Parsing [sent. 1507 len. 12]: Indeed , I can hardly say I have done it yet !
Parsing [sent. 1508 len. 13]: they would very much like to run their horns into me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1509 len. 7]: `` Then it MUST be dangerous !
Parsing [sent. 1510 len. 11]: It shows that they were not meant to work ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1511 len. 14]: `` They were meant to work if I can make them work . ''
Parsing [sent. 1512 len. 8]: `` Then you approve of slavery ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1513 len. 11]: said Mercy She hardly knew what made her oppose him .
Parsing [sent. 1514 len. 27]: As yet she bad no opinions of her own , though she did catch a thought sometimes , when it happened to come within her reach .
Parsing [sent. 1515 len. 6]: Alister smiled a curious smile .
Parsing [sent. 1516 len. 18]: `` I should , '' he said , `` if the right people were made slaves of .
Parsing [sent. 1517 len. 23]: I would take shares in a company of Algerine pirates to rid the social world of certain types of the human ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1518 len. 7]: The girls looked at each other .
Parsing [sent. 1519 len. 4]: `` Sharp ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1520 len. 5]: said Christina to herself .
Parsing [sent. 1521 len. 10]: `` What sorts would you have them take ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1522 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 1523 len. 10]: `` Idle men in particular , '' answered Alister .
Parsing [sent. 1524 len. 13]: `` Would you not have them take idle ladies as well ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1525 len. 15]: `` I would see first how they behaved when the men were gone . ''
Parsing [sent. 1526 len. 23]: `` You believe , then , '' said Mercy , `` we have a right to make the lower animals work ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1527 len. 12]: `` I think it is our duty , '' answered Alister .
Parsing [sent. 1528 len. 28]: `` At all events , if we do not , we must either kill them off by degrees , or cede them this world , and emigrate .
Parsing [sent. 1529 len. 14]: But even that would be a bad thing for my little bulls there !
Parsing [sent. 1530 len. 18]: It is not so many years since the last wolf was killed -- here , close by !
Parsing [sent. 1531 len. 14]: and if the dogs turned to wolves again , where would they be ?
Parsing [sent. 1532 len. 15]: The domestic animals would then have wild beasts instead of men for their masters !
Parsing [sent. 1533 len. 13]: To have the world a habitable one , man must rule . ''
Parsing [sent. 1534 len. 10]: `` Men are nothing but tyrants to them ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1535 len. 3]: said Christina .
Parsing [sent. 1536 len. 8]: `` Most are , I admit . ''
Parsing [sent. 1537 len. 21]: Ere he could prevent her , she had walked up to the near bull , and begun to pat him .
Parsing [sent. 1538 len. 21]: He poked a sharp wicked horn sideways at her , catching her cloak on it , and grazing her arm .
Parsing [sent. 1539 len. 6]: She started back very white .
Parsing [sent. 1540 len. 7]: Alister gave him a terrible tug .
Parsing [sent. 1541 len. 13]: The beast shook his head , and began to paw the earth .
Parsing [sent. 1542 len. 14]: `` It wont do to go near him , '' he said . ''
Parsing [sent. 1543 len. 14]: -- But you need n't be afraid ; he ca n't touch you .
Parsing [sent. 1544 len. 12]: That iron band round his nose has spikes in it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1545 len. 5]: `` Poor fellow ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1546 len. 15]: said Christina ; `` it is no wonder he should be out of temper !
Parsing [sent. 1547 len. 7]: It must hurt him dreadfully ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1548 len. 19]: `` It does hurt him when he pulls against it , but not when he is quiet . ''
Parsing [sent. 1549 len. 7]: `` I call it cruel ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1550 len. 5]: `` I do not .
Parsing [sent. 1551 len. 18]: The fellow knows what is wanted of him -- just as well as any naughty child . ''
Parsing [sent. 1552 len. 11]: `` How can he when he has no reason ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1553 len. 8]: `` Oh , has n't he ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1554 len. 12]: `` Animals have no reason ; they have only instinct ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1555 len. 14]: `` They have plenty of reason -- more than many men and women .
Parsing [sent. 1556 len. 14]: They are not so far off us as pride makes most people think !
Parsing [sent. 1557 len. 18]: It is only those that do n't know them that talk about the instinct of animals ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1558 len. 7]: `` Do you know them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1559 len. 17]: `` Pretty well for a man ; but they 're often too much for me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1560 len. 11]: `` Anyhow that poor thing does not know better . ''
Parsing [sent. 1561 len. 27]: `` He knows enough ; and if he did not , would you allow him to do as he pleased because he did n't know better ?
Parsing [sent. 1562 len. 13]: He wanted to put his horn into you a moment ago ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1563 len. 24]: `` Still it must be hard to want very much to do a thing , and not be able to do it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1564 len. 3]: said Mercy .
Parsing [sent. 1565 len. 27]: `` I used to feel as if I could tear my old nurse to pieces when she would n't let me do as I wanted ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1566 len. 3]: said Christina .
Parsing [sent. 1567 len. 13]: `` I suppose you do whatever you please now , ladies ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1568 len. 5]: `` No , indeed .
Parsing [sent. 1569 len. 16]: We wanted to go to London , and here we are for the winter ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1570 len. 8]: `` And you think it hard ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1571 len. 7]: `` Yes , we do . ''
Parsing [sent. 1572 len. 14]: `` And so , from sympathy , you side with my cattle ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1573 len. 6]: `` Well -- yes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1574 len. 18]: `` You think I have no right to keep them captive , and make them work ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1575 len. 9]: `` None at all , '' said Christina .
Parsing [sent. 1576 len. 11]: `` Then it is time I let them go ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1577 len. 8]: Alister made for the animals ' heads .
Parsing [sent. 1578 len. 5]: `` No , no !
Parsing [sent. 1579 len. 5]: please do n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1580 len. 15]: cried both the girls , turning , the one white , the other red .
Parsing [sent. 1581 len. 11]: `` Certainly not if you do not wish it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1582 len. 7]: answered Alister , staying his step .
Parsing [sent. 1583 len. 21]: `` If I did , however , you would be quite safe , for they would not come near me .
Parsing [sent. 1584 len. 23]: They would be off up that hill as hard as they could tear , jumping everything that came in their way . ''
Parsing [sent. 1585 len. 12]: `` Is it not very dull here in the winter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1586 len. 23]: asked Christina , panting a little , but trying to look as if she had known quite well he was only joking .
Parsing [sent. 1587 len. 9]: `` I do not find it dull . ''
Parsing [sent. 1588 len. 17]: `` Ah , but you are a man , and can do as you please ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1589 len. 21]: `` I never could do as I pleased , and so I please as I do , '' answered Alister .
Parsing [sent. 1590 len. 9]: `` I do not quite understand you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1591 len. 22]: `` When you can not do as you like , the best thing is to like what you have to do .
Parsing [sent. 1592 len. 13]: One 's own way is not to be had in this world .
Parsing [sent. 1593 len. 14]: There 's a better , though , which is to be had ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1594 len. 21]: `` I have heard a parson talk like that , '' said Mercy , `` but never a layman ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1595 len. 12]: `` My father was a parson as good as any layman .
Parsing [sent. 1596 len. 18]: He would have laid me on my back in a moment -- here as I stand ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1597 len. 9]: said Alister , drawing himself to his height .
Parsing [sent. 1598 len. 14]: He broke suddenly into Gaelic , addressing the more troublesome of the bulls .
Parsing [sent. 1599 len. 42]: No better pleased to stand still than to go on , he had fallen to digging at his neighbour , who retorted with the horn convenient , and presently there was a great mixing of bull and harness and cloddy earth .
Parsing [sent. 1600 len. 10]: Turning quickly towards them , Alister dropped a rein .
Parsing [sent. 1601 len. 32]: In a moment the plough was out of the furrow , and the bulls were straining every muscle , each to send the other into the wilds of the unseen creation .
Parsing [sent. 1602 len. 22]: Alister sprang to their heads , and taking them by their noses forced them back into the line of the furrow .
Parsing [sent. 1603 len. 24]: Christina , thinking they had broken loose , fled ; but there was Mercy with the reins , hauling with all her might !
Parsing [sent. 1604 len. 8]: `` Thank you , thank you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1605 len. 8]: said the laird , laughing with pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 1606 len. 8]: `` You are a friend indeed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1607 len. 3]: `` Mercy !
Parsing [sent. 1608 len. 2]: Mercy !
Parsing [sent. 1609 len. 8]: come away directly , '' cried Christina .
Parsing [sent. 1610 len. 7]: But Mercy did not heed her .
Parsing [sent. 1611 len. 20]: The laird took the reins , and administering a blow each to the animals , made them stand still .
Parsing [sent. 1612 len. 40]: There are tender-hearted people who virtually ohject to the whole scheme of creation ; they would neither have force used nor pain suffered ; they talk as if kindness could do everything , even where it is not felt .
Parsing [sent. 1613 len. 15]: Millions of human beings but for suffering would never develop an atom of affection .
Parsing [sent. 1614 len. 11]: The man who would spare DUE suffering is not wise .
Parsing [sent. 1615 len. 16]: It is folly to conclude a thing ought not to be done because it hurts .
Parsing [sent. 1616 len. 37]: There are powers to be born , creations to be perfected , sinners to be redeemed , through the ministry of pain , that could be born , perfected , redeemed , in no other way .
Parsing [sent. 1617 len. 11]: But Christina was neither wise nor unwise after such fashion .
Parsing [sent. 1618 len. 25]: She was annoyed at finding the laird not easily to be brought to her feet , and Mercy already advanced to his good graces .
Parsing [sent. 1619 len. 16]: She was not jealous of Mercy , for was she not beautiful and Mercy plain ?
Parsing [sent. 1620 len. 19]: but Mercy had by her PLUCK secured an advantage , and the handsome ploughman looked at her admiringly !
Parsing [sent. 1621 len. 30]: Partly therefore because she was not pleased with him , partly that she thought a little outcry would be telling , -- `` Oh , you wicked man ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1622 len. 12]: she cried , `` you are hurting the poor brutes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1623 len. 11]: `` No more than is necessary , '' he answered .
Parsing [sent. 1624 len. 6]: `` You are cruel ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1625 len. 7]: `` Good morning , ladies . ''
Parsing [sent. 1626 len. 23]: He just managed to take off his bonnet , for the four-legged explosions at the end of his plough were pulling madly .
Parsing [sent. 1627 len. 19]: He slackened his reins , and away it went , like a sharp knife through a Dutch cheese .
Parsing [sent. 1628 len. 9]: `` You 've made him quite cross ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1629 len. 3]: said Mercy .
Parsing [sent. 1630 len. 9]: `` What a brute of a man ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1631 len. 3]: said Christina .
Parsing [sent. 1632 len. 22]: She never restrained herself from teasing cat or puppy for her amusement -- did not even mind hurting it a little .
Parsing [sent. 1633 len. 13]: Those capable of distinguishing between the qualities of resembling actions are few .
Parsing [sent. 1634 len. 12]: There are some who will regard Alister as capable of vivisection .
Parsing [sent. 1635 len. 34]: On one occasion when the brothers were boys , Alister having lost his temper in the pursuit of a runaway pony , fell upon it with his fists the moment he caught it .
Parsing [sent. 1636 len. 22]: Ian put himself between , and received , without word or motion , more than one blow meant for the pony .
Parsing [sent. 1637 len. 8]: `` Donal was only in fun ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1638 len. 13]: he said , as soon as Alister 's anger had spent itself .
Parsing [sent. 1639 len. 11]: `` Father would never have punished him like that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1640 len. 14]: Alister was ashamed , and never again was guilty of such an outbreak .
Parsing [sent. 1641 len. 25]: From that moment he began the serious endeavour to subjugate the pig , tiger , mule , or whatever animal he found in himself .
Parsing [sent. 1642 len. 28]: There remained , however , this difference between them -- that Alister punished without compunction , while Ian was sorely troubled at having to cause any suffering .
Parsing [sent. 1643 len. 3]: CHAPTER XI .
Parsing [sent. 1644 len. 3]: THE FIR-GROVE .
Parsing [sent. 1645 len. 44]: As the ladies went up the ridge , regarded in the neighbourhood as the chief 's pleasure-ground where nobody went except to call upon the chief , they must , having mounted it lower down than where they descended , pass the cottage .
Parsing [sent. 1646 len. 30]: The grove of birch , mountain-ash , and fir which surrounded it , was planted quite irregularly , and a narrow foot-path went winding through it to the door .
Parsing [sent. 1647 len. 34]: Against one of the firs was a rough bench turned to the west , and seated upon it they saw Ian , smoking a formless mass of much defiled sea-foam , otherwise meer-schaum .
Parsing [sent. 1648 len. 10]: He rose , uncovered , and sat down again .
Parsing [sent. 1649 len. 33]: But Christina , who regarded it as a praiseworthy kindness to address any one beneath her , not only returned his salutation , but stopped , and said , `` Good morning !
Parsing [sent. 1650 len. 19]: We have been learning how they plough in Scotland , but I fear we annoyed the ploughman . ''
Parsing [sent. 1651 len. 28]: `` Fergus does sometimes LOOK surly , '' said Ian , rising again , and going to her ; `` he has bad rheumatism , poor fellow !
Parsing [sent. 1652 len. 18]: And then he ca n't speak a word of English , and is ashamed of it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1653 len. 10]: `` The man we saw spoke English very well .
Parsing [sent. 1654 len. 8]: Is Fergus your brother 's name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1655 len. 17]: `` No ; my brother 's name is Alister -- that is Gaelic for Alexander . ''
Parsing [sent. 1656 len. 17]: `` He was ploughing with two wild little oxen , and could hardly manage them . ''
Parsing [sent. 1657 len. 19]: `` Then it must have been Alister -- only , excuse me , he could manage them perfectly .
Parsing [sent. 1658 len. 9]: Alister could break a pair of buffaloes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1659 len. 19]: `` He seemed rather vexed , and I thought it might be that we made the creatures troublesome .
Parsing [sent. 1660 len. 17]: -- I do not mean he was rude -- only a little rough to us . ''
Parsing [sent. 1661 len. 8]: Ian smiled , and waited for more .
Parsing [sent. 1662 len. 15]: `` He did not like to be told he was hard on the animals .
Parsing [sent. 1663 len. 12]: I only said the poor things did not know better ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1664 len. 6]: `` Ah -- I see !
Parsing [sent. 1665 len. 21]: -- He understands animals so well , he does n't like to be meddled with in his management of them .
Parsing [sent. 1666 len. 21]: I daresay he told you that , if they did n't know better , he had to teach them better !
Parsing [sent. 1667 len. 6]: They are troublesome little wretches .
Parsing [sent. 1668 len. 14]: -- Yes , I confess he is a little touchy about animals ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1669 len. 12]: Somehow Christina felt herself rebuked , and did not like it .
Parsing [sent. 1670 len. 21]: He had almost told her that , if she had quarrelled with his ploughman-brother , the fault must be hers !
Parsing [sent. 1671 len. 26]: `` But indeed , Captain Macruadh , '' she said -- for the people called him captain , `` I am not ignorant about animals !
Parsing [sent. 1672 len. 13]: We have horses of our own , and know all about them .
Parsing [sent. 1673 len. 8]: -- Do n't we , Mercy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1674 len. 18]: `` Yes , '' said Mercy ; `` they take apples and sugar from our hands . ''
Parsing [sent. 1675 len. 16]: `` And you would have the chief 's bulls tamed with apples and sugar ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1676 len. 5]: returned Ian , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 1677 len. 12]: `` But the horses were tamed before ever you saw them !
Parsing [sent. 1678 len. 28]: If you had taken them wild , or even when they were foals , and taught them everything , then you would know a little about them .
Parsing [sent. 1679 len. 7]: An acquaintance is not a friendship !
Parsing [sent. 1680 len. 32]: My brother loves animals and understands them almost like human beings ; he understands them better than some human beings , for the most cunning of the animals are yet simple .
Parsing [sent. 1681 len. 17]: He knows what they are thinking when I can not read a word of their faces .
Parsing [sent. 1682 len. 67]: I remember one terrible night , winters ago -- there had been a blinding drift on and off during the day , and my father and mother were getting anxious about him -- how he came staggering in , and fell on the floor , and a great lump in his plaid on his back began to wallow about , and forth crept his big colley !
Parsing [sent. 1683 len. 33]: They had been to the hills to look after a few sheep , and the poor dog was exhausted , and Alister carried him home at the risk of his life . ''
Parsing [sent. 1684 len. 14]: `` A valuable animal , I do n't doubt , '' said Christina .
Parsing [sent. 1685 len. 15]: `` He had been , but was no more what the world calls valuable .
Parsing [sent. 1686 len. 14]: He was an old dog almost past work -- but the wisest creature !
Parsing [sent. 1687 len. 12]: Poor fellow , he never recovered that day on the hills !
Parsing [sent. 1688 len. 26]: A week or so after , we buried him -- in the hope of a blessed resurrection , '' added Ian , with a smile .
Parsing [sent. 1689 len. 17]: The girls looked at each other as much as to say , `` Good heavens ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1690 len. 19]: He caught the look , but said nothing , for he saw they had `` no understanding . ''
Parsing [sent. 1691 len. 64]: The brothers believed most devoutly that the God who is present at the death-bed of the sparrow does not forget the sparrow when he is dead ; for they had been taught that he is an unchanging God ; `` and , '' argued Ian , `` what God remembers , he thinks of , and what he thinks of , IS . ''
Parsing [sent. 1692 len. 13]: But Ian knew that what misses the heart falls under the feet !
Parsing [sent. 1693 len. 30]: A man is bound to SHARE his best , not to tumble his SEED-PEARLS into the feeding-trough , to break the teeth of them that are there at meat .
Parsing [sent. 1694 len. 23]: He had but lifted a corner to give them a glimpse of the Life eternal , and the girls thought him ridiculous !
Parsing [sent. 1695 len. 27]: The human caterpillar that has not yet even begun to sicken with the growth of her psyche-wings , is among the poorest of the human animals !
Parsing [sent. 1696 len. 9]: But Christina was not going to give in !
Parsing [sent. 1697 len. 14]: Her one idea of the glory of life was the subjugation of men .
Parsing [sent. 1698 len. 15]: As if moved by a sudden impulse , she went close up to him .
Parsing [sent. 1699 len. 59]: `` Do not be angry with me , '' she said , almost coaxingly , but with a visible mingling of boldness and shyness , neither of them quite assumed ; for , though conscious of her boldness , she was not frightened ; and there was something in the eagle-face that made it easy to look shy .
Parsing [sent. 1700 len. 9]: `` I did not mean to be rude .
Parsing [sent. 1701 len. 5]: I am sorry . ''
Parsing [sent. 1702 len. 10]: `` You mistake me , '' he said gently .
Parsing [sent. 1703 len. 13]: `` I only wanted you to know you misjudged my brother . ''
Parsing [sent. 1704 len. 19]: `` Then , if you have forgiven me , you will let me sit for a few minutes !
Parsing [sent. 1705 len. 12]: I am SO tired with walking in the sticky earth ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1706 len. 18]: `` Do , pray , sit down , '' responded Ian heartily , and led the way .
Parsing [sent. 1707 len. 20]: But she sank gracefully at the foot of the next fir , while Mercy sat down on the bench .
Parsing [sent. 1708 len. 28]: `` Do go on with your pipe , '' she said , looking up as she arranged her dress ; `` I am quite used to smoke .
Parsing [sent. 1709 len. 10]: Papa would smoke in church if he dared ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1710 len. 3]: `` Chrissy !
Parsing [sent. 1711 len. 10]: You KNOW he NEVER smokes in the drawing-room ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1712 len. 5]: cried Mercy , scandalized .
Parsing [sent. 1713 len. 12]: `` I have seen him -- when mamma was away . ''
Parsing [sent. 1714 len. 13]: Ian began to be a little more interested in the plain one .
Parsing [sent. 1715 len. 13]: But what must his mother think to see them sitting there together !
Parsing [sent. 1716 len. 6]: He could not help it !
Parsing [sent. 1717 len. 16]: if ladies chose to sit down , it was not for him to forbid them !
Parsing [sent. 1718 len. 11]: And there WAS a glimmer of conscience in the younger !
Parsing [sent. 1719 len. 13]: Most men believe only what they find or imagine possible to themselves .
Parsing [sent. 1720 len. 36]: They may be sure of this , that there are men so different from them that no judgment they pass upon them is worth a straw , simply because it does not apply to them .
Parsing [sent. 1721 len. 12]: I assert of Ian that neither beauty nor intellect attracted him .
Parsing [sent. 1722 len. 16]: Imagination would entice him , but the least lack of principle would arrest its influence .
Parsing [sent. 1723 len. 15]: The simplest manifestation of a live conscience would draw him more than anything else .
Parsing [sent. 1724 len. 21]: I do not mean the conscience that proposes questions , but the conscience that loves right and turns from wrong .
Parsing [sent. 1725 len. 13]: Notwithstanding the damsel 's invitation , he did not resume his pipe .
Parsing [sent. 1726 len. 26]: He was simple , but not free and easy -- too sensitive to the relations of life to be familiar upon invitation with any girl .
Parsing [sent. 1727 len. 30]: If she was not one with whom to hold real converse , it was impossible to blow dandelions with her , and talk must confine itself to the commonplace .
Parsing [sent. 1728 len. 30]: After gentlest assays to know what was possible , the result might be that he grew courteously playful , or drew back , and confined himself to the formal .
Parsing [sent. 1729 len. 34]: In the conversation that followed , he soon found the younger capable of being interested , and , having seen much in many parts of the world , had plenty to tell her .
Parsing [sent. 1730 len. 29]: Christina smiled sweetly , taking everything with over-gentle politeness , but looking as if all that interested her was , that there they were , talking about it .
Parsing [sent. 1731 len. 29]: Provoked at last by her persistent lack of GENUINE reception , Ian was tempted to try her with something different : perhaps she might be moved to horror !
Parsing [sent. 1732 len. 7]: Any feeling would be a FIND !
Parsing [sent. 1733 len. 17]: He thought he would tell them an adventure he had read in a book of travels .
Parsing [sent. 1734 len. 34]: In Persia , alone in a fine moonlit night , the traveller had fallen asleep on his horse , but woke suddenly , roused by something frightful , he did not know what .
Parsing [sent. 1735 len. 15]: The evil odour all about him explained , however , his bewilderment and terror .
Parsing [sent. 1736 len. 57]: Presently he was bumped on this side , then bumped on that ; first one knee , then the other , would be struck ; now the calf of one leg was caught , now the calf of the other ; then both would be caught at once , and he shoved nearly over his pommel .
Parsing [sent. 1737 len. 22]: His horse was very uneasy , but could ill help himself in the midst of a moving mass of uncertain objects .
Parsing [sent. 1738 len. 59]: The traveller for a moment imagined himself in a boat on the sea , with a huge quantity of wrecked cargo floating around him , whence came the frequent collisions he was undergoing ; but he soon perceived that the vague shapes were boxes , pannierwise on the backs of mules , moving in caravan along the desert .
Parsing [sent. 1739 len. 36]: Of not a few the lids were broken , of some gone altogether , revealing their contents -- the bodies of good Mussulmans , on their way to the consecrated soil of Mecca for burial .
Parsing [sent. 1740 len. 56]: Carelessly shambled the mules along , stumbling as they jogged over the uneven ground , their boxes tilting from side to side , sorely shaken , some of them , in frustration of dying hopes , scattering their contents over the track -- for here and there a mule carried but a wreck of coffins .
Parsing [sent. 1741 len. 22]: On and on over the rough gravelly waste , under the dead cold moon , weltered the slow stream of death !
Parsing [sent. 1742 len. 19]: `` You may be sure , '' concluded Ian , `` he made haste out of the ruck !
Parsing [sent. 1743 len. 37]: But it was with difficulty he got clear , happily to windward -- then for an hour sat motionless on his horse , watching through the moonlight the long dark shadow flitting toward its far-off goal .
Parsing [sent. 1744 len. 25]: When at length he could no longer descry it , he put his horse to his speed -- but not to overtake it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1745 len. 17]: As he spoke , Mercy 's eyes grew larger and larger , never leaving his face .
Parsing [sent. 1746 len. 9]: She had at least imagination enough for that !
Parsing [sent. 1747 len. 10]: Christina curled her pretty lip , and looked disgusted .
Parsing [sent. 1748 len. 14]: The one at a horrible tale was horrified , the other merely disgusted !
Parsing [sent. 1749 len. 14]: The one showed herself capable of some reception ; the other did not .
Parsing [sent. 1750 len. 10]: `` Something might be done with that girl ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1751 len. 3]: thought Ian .
Parsing [sent. 1752 len. 8]: `` Did he see their faces ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1753 len. 3]: drawled Christina .
Parsing [sent. 1754 len. 12]: Mercy was silent , but her eyes remained fixed on him .
Parsing [sent. 1755 len. 15]: It was Ian 's telling , more than the story , that impressed her .
Parsing [sent. 1756 len. 13]: `` I do n't think he mentions them , '' answered Ian .
Parsing [sent. 1757 len. 26]: `` But shall I tell you , '' he went on , `` what seems to me the most unpleasant thing about the business ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1758 len. 7]: `` Do , '' said Christina .
Parsing [sent. 1759 len. 20]: `` It is that the poor ghosts should see such a disagreeable fuss made with their old clothes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1760 len. 3]: Christina smiled .
Parsing [sent. 1761 len. 15]: `` Do you think ghosts see what goes on after they are dead ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1762 len. 3]: asked Mercy .
Parsing [sent. 1763 len. 18]: `` The ghosts are not dead , '' said Ian , `` and I ca n't tell .
Parsing [sent. 1764 len. 18]: But I am inclined to think some ghosts have to stay a while and look on . ''
Parsing [sent. 1765 len. 10]: `` What would be the good of that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1766 len. 3]: returned Mercy .
Parsing [sent. 1767 len. 23]: `` Perhaps to teach them the little good they were in , or got out of the world , '' he answered .
Parsing [sent. 1768 len. 22]: `` To have to stick to a thing after it is dead , is terrible , but may teach much . ''
Parsing [sent. 1769 len. 11]: `` I do n't understand you , '' said Mercy .
Parsing [sent. 1770 len. 8]: `` The world is not dead ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1771 len. 6]: `` Better and better ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1772 len. 5]: thought Ian with himself .
Parsing [sent. 1773 len. 6]: `` The girl CAN understand !
Parsing [sent. 1774 len. 20]: -- A thing is always dead to you when you have done with it , '' he answered her .
Parsing [sent. 1775 len. 33]: `` Suppose you had a ball-dress crumpled and unsightly -- the roses on it withered , and the tinsel shining hideously through them -- would it not be a dead dress ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1776 len. 6]: `` Yes , indeed . ''
Parsing [sent. 1777 len. 42]: `` Then suppose , for something you had done , or for something you would not stop being , you had to wear that ball-dress till something came about -- you would be like the ghosts that can not get away .
Parsing [sent. 1778 len. 22]: -- Suppose , when you were old and wrinkled , -- '' `` You are very amusing , Captain Macruadh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1779 len. 8]: said Christina , with a bell-like laugh .
Parsing [sent. 1780 len. 5]: But Ian went on .
Parsing [sent. 1781 len. 18]: `` Some stories tell us of ghosts with the same old wrinkled faces in which they died .
Parsing [sent. 1782 len. 54]: The world and its uses over , they are compelled to haunt it still , seeing how things go but taking no share in them beholding the relief their death is to all , feeling they have lost their chance of beauty , and are fixed in ugliness , having wasted being itself !
Parsing [sent. 1783 len. 35]: They are like a man in a miserable dream , in which he can do nothing , but in which he must stay , and go dreaming , dreaming on without hope of release .
Parsing [sent. 1784 len. 17]: To be in a world and have nothing to do with it , must be awful !
Parsing [sent. 1785 len. 11]: A little more imagination would do some people good ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1786 len. 5]: `` No , please !
Parsing [sent. 1787 len. 7]: -- no more for me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1788 len. 8]: said Christina , laughing as she rose .
Parsing [sent. 1789 len. 4]: Mercy was silent .
Parsing [sent. 1790 len. 23]: Though she had never really thought about anything herself , she did not doubt that certain people were in earnest about something .
Parsing [sent. 1791 len. 37]: She knew that she ought to be good , and she knew she was not good ; how to be good she did not know , for she had never set herself , to be good .
Parsing [sent. 1792 len. 41]: She sometimes wished she were good ; but there are thousands of wandering ghosts who would be good if they might without taking trouble : the kind of goodness they desire would not be worth a life to hold it .
Parsing [sent. 1793 len. 24]: Fear is a wholesome element in the human economy ; they are merely silly who would banish it from all association with religion .
Parsing [sent. 1794 len. 34]: True , there is no religion in fear ; religion is love , and love casts out fear ; but until a man has love , it is well he should have fear .
Parsing [sent. 1795 len. 18]: So long as there are wild beasts about , it is better to be afraid than secure .
Parsing [sent. 1796 len. 34]: The vague awe ready to assail every soul that has not found rest in its source , readier the more honest the soul , had for the first time laid hold of Mercy .
Parsing [sent. 1797 len. 13]: The earnest face of the speaker had most to do with it .
Parsing [sent. 1798 len. 9]: She had never heard anybody talk like that !
Parsing [sent. 1799 len. 33]: The lady of the house appeared , asking , with kind dignity , if they would not take some refreshment : to a highlander hospitality is a law where not a passion .
Parsing [sent. 1800 len. 5]: Christina declined the offer .
Parsing [sent. 1801 len. 3]: `` Thanks !
Parsing [sent. 1802 len. 17]: we were only a little tired , and are quite rested now , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 1803 len. 9]: `` How beautifully sheltered your house is ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1804 len. 28]: `` On the side of the sea , yes , '' answered Mrs. Macruadh ; `` but not much on the east where we want it most .
Parsing [sent. 1805 len. 8]: The trees are growing , however ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1806 len. 15]: When the sisters were out of sight of the cottage -- `` Well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1807 len. 16]: remarked Christina , `` he 's a nice young man too , is he not ?
Parsing [sent. 1808 len. 4]: Exceedingly well bred !
Parsing [sent. 1809 len. 6]: And what taste he has !
Parsing [sent. 1810 len. 8]: He knows how to amuse ladies ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1811 len. 5]: Mercy did not answer .
Parsing [sent. 1812 len. 9]: `` I never heard anything so disgusting ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1813 len. 3]: pursued Christina .
Parsing [sent. 1814 len. 17]: `` But , '' suggested Mercy , `` you like to READ horrid stories , Chrissy !
Parsing [sent. 1815 len. 6]: You said so only yesterday !
Parsing [sent. 1816 len. 18]: And there was nothing in what he told us that ought n't to be spoken about . ''
Parsing [sent. 1817 len. 3]: `` What !
Parsing [sent. 1818 len. 21]: -- not those hideous coffins -- and the bodies dropping out of them -- all crawling , no doubt ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1819 len. 8]: `` That is your own , Chrissy !
Parsing [sent. 1820 len. 11]: You KNOW he did not go so far as that !
Parsing [sent. 1821 len. 26]: If Colonel Webberly had told you the story , you would have called it charming -- in fun , of course , I mean ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1822 len. 9]: But Christina never liked the argumentum ad feminam .
Parsing [sent. 1823 len. 5]: `` I would not !
Parsing [sent. 1824 len. 7]: You know I would not ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1825 len. 3]: she exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 1826 len. 15]: `` I do believe the girl has fallen in love with the horrid man !
Parsing [sent. 1827 len. 13]: Of the two , I declare , I like the ploughman better .
Parsing [sent. 1828 len. 18]: I am sorry I happened to vex him ; he is a good stupid sort of fellow !
Parsing [sent. 1829 len. 7]: I ca n't bear this man !
Parsing [sent. 1830 len. 19]: How horribly he fixed his eyes on you when he was talking that rubbish about the ball-dress ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1831 len. 9]: `` He was anxious to make himself understood .
Parsing [sent. 1832 len. 15]: I know he made me think I must mind what I was about ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1833 len. 5]: `` Oh , nonsense !
Parsing [sent. 1834 len. 18]: We did n't come into this wilderness to be preached to by a lay John the Baptist !
Parsing [sent. 1835 len. 7]: He is an ill-bred fellow ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1836 len. 17]: She would not have said so much against him , had not Mercy taken his part .
Parsing [sent. 1837 len. 22]: Mercy rarely contradicted her sister , but even this brief passage with a real man had roused the justice in her .
Parsing [sent. 1838 len. 14]: `` I do n't agree with you , Chrissy , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 1839 len. 12]: `` He seems to me VERY MUCH of a gentleman ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1840 len. 30]: She did not venture to say all she felt , not choosing to be at absolute variance , and the threatened quarrel blew over like a shower in spring .
Parsing [sent. 1841 len. 41]: But some sort of impression remained from the words of Ian on the mind of Mercy , for the next morning she read a chapter in the book of Genesis , and said a prayer her mother had taught her .
Parsing [sent. 1842 len. 3]: CHAPTER XII .
Parsing [sent. 1843 len. 4]: AMONG THE HILLS .
Parsing [sent. 1844 len. 40]: When Mr. and Mrs. Palmer reached Inverness , they found they could spend a few days there , one way and another , to good purpose , for they had friends to visit as well as shopping to do .
Parsing [sent. 1845 len. 39]: Mr. Palmer 's affairs calling him to the south were not immediately pressing , and their sojourn extended itself to a full week of eight days , during which the girls were under no rule but their own .
Parsing [sent. 1846 len. 27]: Their parents regarded them as perfectly to be trusted , nor were the girls themselves aware of any reason why they should not be so regarded .
Parsing [sent. 1847 len. 79]: The window of Christina 's bedroom overlooked a part of the road between the New House and the old castle ; and she could see from it all the ridge as far as the grove that concealed the cottage : if now they saw more of the young men their neighbours , and were led farther into the wilds , thickets , or pasturage of their acquaintance , I can not say she had no hand in it .
Parsing [sent. 1848 len. 30]: She was depressed by a sense of failure ; the boor , as she called him , was much too thick-skinned for any society but that of his bulls !
Parsing [sent. 1849 len. 30]: and she had made no progress with the Valentine any more than with the Orson ; he was better pleased with her ugly sister than with her beautiful self !
Parsing [sent. 1850 len. 46]: She would have given neither of tie men another thought , but that there was no one else with whom to do any of that huckster business called flirting , which to her had just harm enough in it to make it interesting to her .
Parsing [sent. 1851 len. 17]: She was one of those who can imagine beauty nor enjoyment in a thing altogether right .
Parsing [sent. 1852 len. 37]: She took it for granted that bad and beautiful were often one ; that the pleasures of the world owed their delight to a touch , a wash , a tincture of the wicked in them .
Parsing [sent. 1853 len. 19]: Such have so many crooked lines in themselves that they fancy nature laid down on lines of crookedness .
Parsing [sent. 1854 len. 18]: They think the obliquity the beauty of the campanile , the blurring the charm of the sketch .
Parsing [sent. 1855 len. 11]: I tread on delicate ground -- ground which , alas !
Parsing [sent. 1856 len. 37]: many girls tread boldly , scattering much feather-bloom from the wings of poor Psyche , gathering for her hoards of unlovely memories , and sowing the seed of many a wish that they had done differently .
Parsing [sent. 1857 len. 17]: They can not pass over such ground and escape having their nature more or less vulgarized .
Parsing [sent. 1858 len. 25]: I do not speak of anything counted wicked ; it is only gambling with the precious and lovely things of the deepest human relation !
Parsing [sent. 1859 len. 44]: If a girl with such an experience marry a man she loves -- with what power of loving may be left such a one -- will she not now and then remember something it would be joy to discover she had but dreamed ?
Parsing [sent. 1860 len. 34]: will she be able always to forget certain cabinets in her brain which `` it would not do '' to throw open to the husband who thinks her simple as well as innocent ?
Parsing [sent. 1861 len. 24]: Honesty and truth , God 's essentials , are perhaps more lacking in ordinary intercourse between young men and women than anywhere else .
Parsing [sent. 1862 len. 13]: Greed and selfishness are as busy there as in money-making and ambition .
Parsing [sent. 1863 len. 23]: Thousands on both sides are constantly seeking more than their share -- more also than they even intend to return value for .
Parsing [sent. 1864 len. 28]: Thousands of girls have been made sad for life by the speeches of a man careful all the time to SAY nothing that amounted to a pledge !
Parsing [sent. 1865 len. 57]: I do not forget that many a woman who would otherwise have been worth little , has for her sorrow found such consolation that she has become rich before God ; these words hold nevertheless : `` It must needs be that offences come , but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1866 len. 24]: On a morning two days later , Christina called Mercy , rather imperiously , to get ready at once for their usual walk .
Parsing [sent. 1867 len. 8]: She obeyed , and they set out .
Parsing [sent. 1868 len. 13]: Christina declared she was perishing with cold , and they walked fast .
Parsing [sent. 1869 len. 24]: By and by they saw on the road before them the two brothers walking slow ; one was reading , the other listening .
Parsing [sent. 1870 len. 20]: When they came nearer they descried in Alister 's hand a manuscript volume ; Ian carried an old-fashioned fowling-piece .
Parsing [sent. 1871 len. 21]: It was a hard frost , which was perhaps the cause of Alister 's leisure so early in the day .
Parsing [sent. 1872 len. 14]: Hearing the light steps of the girls behind them , the men turned .
Parsing [sent. 1873 len. 8]: The laird was the first to speak .
Parsing [sent. 1874 len. 77]: The plough and the fierce bulls not there to bewilder their judgment , the young women immediately discovered their perception in the matter of breeding to be less infallible than they had imagined it : no well bred woman could for a moment doubt the man before them a gentleman -- though his carriage was more courteous and more natural than is often seen in a Mayfair drawing-room , and his English , a little old-fashioned .
Parsing [sent. 1875 len. 12]: Ian was at once more like and more unlike other people .
Parsing [sent. 1876 len. 22]: His manner was equally courteous , but notably stiffer : he was as much at his ease , but more reserved .
Parsing [sent. 1877 len. 16]: To use a figure , he did not step out so far to meet them .
Parsing [sent. 1878 len. 5]: They walked on together .
Parsing [sent. 1879 len. 14]: `` You are a little earlier than usual this morning , ladies ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1880 len. 4]: remarked the chief .
Parsing [sent. 1881 len. 11]: `` How do you know that , Mr. Macruadh ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1882 len. 3]: rejoined Christina .
Parsing [sent. 1883 len. 17]: `` I often see you pass -- and till now always at the same hour . ''
Parsing [sent. 1884 len. 10]: `` And yet we have never met before ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1885 len. 22]: `` The busy and the '' -- he hesitated a moment -- `` unbusy seldom meet , '' said the chief .
Parsing [sent. 1886 len. 10]: `` Why do n't you say the IDLE ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1887 len. 3]: suggested Christina .
Parsing [sent. 1888 len. 8]: `` Because that would be rude . ''
Parsing [sent. 1889 len. 7]: `` Why would it be rude ?
Parsing [sent. 1890 len. 12]: Most people , suppose , are more idle than busy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1891 len. 17]: `` IDLE is a word of blame ; I had no right to use it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1892 len. 17]: `` I should have taken you for one of those who always speak their minds ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1893 len. 18]: `` I hope I do when it is required , and I have any to speak . ''
Parsing [sent. 1894 len. 9]: `` You prefer judging with closed doors ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1895 len. 11]: The chief was silent : he did not understand her .
Parsing [sent. 1896 len. 13]: Did she want him to say he did not think them idle ?
Parsing [sent. 1897 len. 12]: or , if they were , that they were quite right ?
Parsing [sent. 1898 len. 54]: `` I think it hard , '' resumed Christina , with a tone of injury , almost of suffering , in her voice , `` that we should be friendly and open with people , and they all the time thinking of us in a way it would be rude to tell us !
Parsing [sent. 1899 len. 17]: It is enough to make one vow never to speak to -- to anybody again ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1900 len. 7]: Alister turned and looked at her .
Parsing [sent. 1901 len. 5]: What could she mean ?
Parsing [sent. 1902 len. 32]: `` You ca n't think it hard , '' he said , `` that people should not tell you what they think of you the moment they first see you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1903 len. 16]: `` They might at least tell us what they mean by calling us idle ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1904 len. 7]: `` I said NOT BUSY . ''
Parsing [sent. 1905 len. 10]: `` Is EVERYBODY to blame that is idle ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1906 len. 3]: persisted Christina .
Parsing [sent. 1907 len. 14]: `` Perhaps my brother will answer you that question , '' said Alister .
Parsing [sent. 1908 len. 37]: `` If my brother and I tell you honestly what we thought of you when first we saw you , '' said Ian , `` will you tell us honestly what you thought of us ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1909 len. 24]: The girls cast an involuntary glance at each other , and when their eyes met , could not keep them from looking conscious .
Parsing [sent. 1910 len. 25]: A twitching also at the corners of Mercy 's mouth showed they had been saying more than they would care to be cross-questioned upon .
Parsing [sent. 1911 len. 10]: `` Ah , you betray yourselves , ladies ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1912 len. 3]: Ian said .
Parsing [sent. 1913 len. 21]: `` It is all very well to challenge us , but you are not prepared to lead the way ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1914 len. 9]: `` Girls are never allowed to lead ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1915 len. 3]: said Christina .
Parsing [sent. 1916 len. 13]: `` The men are down on them the moment they dare ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1917 len. 12]: `` I am not that way inclined , '' answered Ian .
Parsing [sent. 1918 len. 15]: `` If man or woman lead TO anything , success will justify the leader .
Parsing [sent. 1919 len. 7]: I will propose another thing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1920 len. 6]: `` What is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1921 len. 3]: asked Christina .
Parsing [sent. 1922 len. 35]: `` To agree that , when we are about to part , with no probability of meeting again in this world , we shall speak out plainly what we think of each other ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1923 len. 10]: `` But that will be such a time ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1924 len. 3]: said Christina .
Parsing [sent. 1925 len. 21]: `` In a world that turns quite round every twenty-four hours , it may be a very short time ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1926 len. 19]: `` We shall be coming every summer , though I hope not to stay through another winter ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1927 len. 10]: `` Changes come when they are least expected ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1928 len. 19]: `` We can not know , '' said Alister , `` that we shall never meet again ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1929 len. 9]: `` There the probability will be enough . ''
Parsing [sent. 1930 len. 26]: `` But how can we come to a better -- I mean a FAIRER opinion of each other , when we meet so seldom ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1931 len. 4]: asked Mercy innocently .
Parsing [sent. 1932 len. 20]: `` This is only the second time we have met , and already we are not quite strangers ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1933 len. 3]: said Christina .
Parsing [sent. 1934 len. 30]: `` On the other hand , '' said Alister , `` we have been within call for more than two months , and this is our second meeting ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1935 len. 9]: `` Well , who has not called ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1936 len. 3]: said Christina .
Parsing [sent. 1937 len. 6]: The young men were silent .
Parsing [sent. 1938 len. 19]: They did not care to discuss the question as to which mother was to blame in the matter .
Parsing [sent. 1939 len. 58]: They were now in the bottom of the valley , had left the road , and were going up the side of the burn , often in single file , Alister leading , and Ian bringing up the rear , for the valley was thickly strewn with lumps of gray rock , of all shapes and sizes .
Parsing [sent. 1940 len. 38]: They seemed to have rolled down the hill on the other side of the burn , but there was no sign of their origin : the hill was covered with grass below , and with heather above .
Parsing [sent. 1941 len. 29]: Such was the winding of the way among the stones -- for path there was none -- that again and again no one of them could see another .
Parsing [sent. 1942 len. 26]: The girls felt the strangeness of it , and began to experience , without knowing it , a little of the power of solitary places .
Parsing [sent. 1943 len. 13]: After walking thus for some distance , they found their leader halted .
Parsing [sent. 1944 len. 25]: `` Here we have to cross the burn , '' he said , `` and go a long way up the other side . ''
Parsing [sent. 1945 len. 10]: `` You want to be rid of us ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1946 len. 3]: said Christina .
Parsing [sent. 1947 len. 9]: `` By no means , '' replied Alister .
Parsing [sent. 1948 len. 10]: `` We are delighted to have you with us .
Parsing [sent. 1949 len. 15]: But we must not let you get tired before turning to go back . ''
Parsing [sent. 1950 len. 18]: `` If you really do not mind , we should like to go a good deal farther .
Parsing [sent. 1951 len. 21]: I want to see round the turn there , where another hill comes from behind and closes up the view .
Parsing [sent. 1952 len. 17]: We have n't anybody to go with us , and have seen nothing of the country .
Parsing [sent. 1953 len. 39]: The men wo n't take us shooting ; and mamma is always so afraid we lose ourselves , or fall down a few precipices , or get into a bog , or be eaten by wild beasts ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1954 len. 18]: `` If this frost last , we shall have time to show you something of the country .
Parsing [sent. 1955 len. 7]: I see you can walk ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1956 len. 21]: `` We can walk well enough , and should so like to get to the top of a mountain ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1957 len. 7]: `` For the crossing then ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1958 len. 25]: said Alister , and turning to the burn , jumped and re-jumped it , as if to let them see how to do it .
Parsing [sent. 1959 len. 43]: The bed of the stream was at the spot narrowed by two rocks , so that , though there was little of it , the water went through with a roar , and a force to take a man off his legs .
Parsing [sent. 1960 len. 27]: It was too wide for the ladies , and they stood eyeing it with dismay , fearing an end to their walk and the pleasant companionship .
Parsing [sent. 1961 len. 22]: `` Do not be frightened , ladies , '' said Alister : `` it is not too wide for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1962 len. 12]: `` You have the advantage of us in your dress ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1963 len. 3]: said Christina .
Parsing [sent. 1964 len. 14]: `` I will get you over quite safe , '' returned the chief .
Parsing [sent. 1965 len. 12]: Christina looked as if she could not trust herself to him .
Parsing [sent. 1966 len. 9]: `` I will try , '' said Mercy .
Parsing [sent. 1967 len. 26]: `` Jump high , '' answered Alister , as he sprang again to the other side , and held out his hand across the chasm .
Parsing [sent. 1968 len. 10]: `` I can neither jump high nor far ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1969 len. 3]: said Mercy .
Parsing [sent. 1970 len. 8]: `` Do n't be in a hurry .
Parsing [sent. 1971 len. 21]: I will take you -- no , not by the hand ; that might slip -- but by the wrist .
Parsing [sent. 1972 len. 18]: Do not think how far you can jump ; all you have to do is to jump .
Parsing [sent. 1973 len. 9]: Only jump as high as you can . ''
Parsing [sent. 1974 len. 16]: Mercy could not help feeling frightened -- the water rushed so fast and loud below .
Parsing [sent. 1975 len. 11]: `` Are you sure you can get me over ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1976 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 1977 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1978 len. 7]: `` Then I will jump . ''
Parsing [sent. 1979 len. 18]: She sprang , and Alister , with a strong pull on her arm , landed her easily .
Parsing [sent. 1980 len. 14]: `` It is your turn now , '' he said , addressing Christina .
Parsing [sent. 1981 len. 10]: She was rather white , but tried to laugh .
Parsing [sent. 1982 len. 13]: `` I -- I -- I do n't think I can ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1983 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 1984 len. 11]: `` It is really nothing , '' persuaded the chief .
Parsing [sent. 1985 len. 18]: `` I am sorry to be a coward , but I fear I was born one . ''
Parsing [sent. 1986 len. 20]: `` Some feelings nobody can help , '' said Ian , `` but nobody need give way to them .
Parsing [sent. 1987 len. 53]: One of the bravest men I ever knew would always start aside if the meanest little cur in the street came barking at him ; and yet on one occasion , when the people were running in all directions , he took a mad dog by the throat , and held him .
Parsing [sent. 1988 len. 4]: Come , Alister !
Parsing [sent. 1989 len. 16]: you take her by one arm and I will take her by the other . ''
Parsing [sent. 1990 len. 25]: The chief sprang to her side , and the moment she felt the grasp of the two men , she had the needful courage .
Parsing [sent. 1991 len. 33]: The three jumped together , and all were presently walking merrily along the other bank , over the same kind of ground , in single file -- Ian bringing up the rear .
Parsing [sent. 1992 len. 13]: The ladies were startled by a gun going off close behind them .
Parsing [sent. 1993 len. 21]: `` I beg your pardon , '' said Ian , `` but I could not let the rascal go . ''
Parsing [sent. 1994 len. 7]: `` What have you killed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1995 len. 4]: his brother asked .
Parsing [sent. 1996 len. 13]: `` Only one of my own family -- a red-haired fellow ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1997 len. 16]: answered Ian , who had left the path , and was going up the hill .
Parsing [sent. 1998 len. 22]: The girls looked , but saw nothing , and following him a few yards , came to him behind a stone .
Parsing [sent. 1999 len. 5]: `` Goodness gracious ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2000 len. 15]: exclaimed Christina , with horror in her tone , `` it 's a fox !
Parsing [sent. 2001 len. 11]: -- Is it possible you have shot a fox ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2002 len. 4]: The men laughed .
Parsing [sent. 2003 len. 6]: `` And why not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2004 len. 14]: asked Alister , as if he had no idea what she could mean .
Parsing [sent. 2005 len. 12]: `` Is the fox a sacred animal in the south ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2006 len. 8]: `` It 's worse than poaching ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2007 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 2008 len. 4]: `` Hardly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2009 len. 3]: returned Alister .
Parsing [sent. 2010 len. 24]: `` No doubt you may get a good deal of fun out of Reynard , but you ca n't make game of him !
Parsing [sent. 2011 len. 12]: Why -- you look as if you had lost a friend !
Parsing [sent. 2012 len. 19]: I admire his intellect , but we ca n't afford to feed it on chickens and lambs . ''
Parsing [sent. 2013 len. 7]: `` But to SHOOT him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2014 len. 4]: `` Why not ?
Parsing [sent. 2015 len. 7]: We do not respect him here .
Parsing [sent. 2016 len. 22]: He is a rascal , to be sure , but then he has no money , and consequently no friends ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2017 len. 6]: `` He has many friends !
Parsing [sent. 2018 len. 16]: What WOULD Christian or Mr. Sercombe say to shooting , actually shooting a fox ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2019 len. 12]: `` You treat him as if he were red gold ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2020 len. 4]: said the chief .
Parsing [sent. 2021 len. 11]: `` We build temples neither to Reynard nor Mammon here .
Parsing [sent. 2022 len. 12]: We leave the men of the south to worship them ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2023 len. 8]: `` They do n't worship them ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2024 len. 3]: said Mercy .
Parsing [sent. 2025 len. 26]: `` Do they not respect the rich man because he is rich , and look down on the poor man because he is poor ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2026 len. 3]: said Ian .
Parsing [sent. 2027 len. 27]: `` Though the rich be a wretch , they think him grand ; though the poor man be like Jesus Christ , they pity him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2028 len. 10]: `` And should n't the poor be pitied ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2029 len. 3]: said Christina .
Parsing [sent. 2030 len. 8]: `` Not except they need pity . ''
Parsing [sent. 2031 len. 10]: `` Is it not pitiable to be poor ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2032 len. 5]: `` By no means .
Parsing [sent. 2033 len. 23]: It is pitiable to be wretched -- and that , I venture to suspect , the rich are oftener than the poor .
Parsing [sent. 2034 len. 24]: -- But as to master Reynard there -- instead of shooting him , what would you have had us do with him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2035 len. 9]: `` Hunt him , to be sure . ''
Parsing [sent. 2036 len. 8]: `` Would he like that better ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2037 len. 10]: `` What he would like is not the question .
Parsing [sent. 2038 len. 7]: The sport is the thing . ''
Parsing [sent. 2039 len. 18]: `` That will show you why he is not sacred here : we do not hunt him .
Parsing [sent. 2040 len. 16]: It would be impossible to hunt this country ; you could not ride the ground .
Parsing [sent. 2041 len. 17]: Besides , there are such multitudes of holes , the hounds would scarcely have a chance .
Parsing [sent. 2042 len. 16]: No ; the only dog to send after the fellow is a leaden one . ''
Parsing [sent. 2043 len. 6]: `` There 's another ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2044 len. 11]: exclaimed the chief ; '' -- there , sneaking away !
Parsing [sent. 2045 len. 10]: -- and your gun not loaded , Ian ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2046 len. 7]: `` I am so glad ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2047 len. 3]: said Christina .
Parsing [sent. 2048 len. 9]: `` He at least will escape you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2049 len. 14]: `` And some poor lamb in the spring wo n't escape him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2050 len. 3]: returned Alister .
Parsing [sent. 2051 len. 9]: `` Lambs are meant to be eaten ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2052 len. 3]: said Christina .
Parsing [sent. 2053 len. 17]: `` Yes ; but a lamb might think it hard to feed such a creature ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2054 len. 23]: `` If the fox is of no good in the world , '' said Mercy , `` why was he made ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2055 len. 14]: `` He ca n't be of no good , '' answered the chief .
Parsing [sent. 2056 len. 17]: `` What if some things are , just that we may get rid of them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2057 len. 13]: `` COULD they be made just to be got rid of ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2058 len. 20]: `` I said -- that WE might get rid of them : there is all the difference in that .
Parsing [sent. 2059 len. 17]: The very first thing men had to do in the world was to fight beasts . ''
Parsing [sent. 2060 len. 35]: `` I think I see what you mean , '' said Mercy : `` if there had been no wild beasts to fight with , men would never have grown able for much ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2061 len. 9]: `` That is it , '' said Alister .
Parsing [sent. 2062 len. 6]: `` They were awful beasts !
Parsing [sent. 2063 len. 16]: and they had poor weapons to fight them with -- neither guns nor knives ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2064 len. 29]: `` And who knows , '' suggested Ian , `` what good it may be to the fox himself to make the best of a greedy life ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2065 len. 15]: `` But what is the good to us of talking about such things ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2066 len. 3]: said Christina .
Parsing [sent. 2067 len. 7]: `` They 're not interesting ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2068 len. 14]: The remark silenced the brothers : where indeed could be use without interest ?
Parsing [sent. 2069 len. 43]: But Mercy , though she could hardly have said she found the conversation VERY interesting , felt there was something in the men that cared to talk about such things , that must be interesting if she could only get at it .
Parsing [sent. 2070 len. 11]: They were not like any other men she had met !
Parsing [sent. 2071 len. 28]: Christina 's whole interest in men was the admiration she looked for and was sure of receiving from them ; Mercy had hitherto found their company stupid .
Parsing [sent. 2072 len. 3]: CHAPTER XIII .
Parsing [sent. 2073 len. 3]: THE LAKE .
Parsing [sent. 2074 len. 18]: Silence lasted until they reached the shoulder of the hill that closed the view up the valley .
Parsing [sent. 2075 len. 30]: As they rounded it , the sun went behind a cloud , and a chill wind , as if from a land where dwelt no life , met them .
Parsing [sent. 2076 len. 23]: The hills stood back , and they were on the shore of a small lake , out of which ran the burn .
Parsing [sent. 2077 len. 21]: They were very desolate-looking hills , with little heather , and that bloomless , to hide their hard gray bones .
Parsing [sent. 2078 len. 30]: Their heads were mostly white with frost and snow ; their shapes had little beauty ; they looked worn and hopeless , ugly and sad -- and so cold !
Parsing [sent. 2079 len. 22]: The water below was slaty gray , in response to the gray sky above : there seemed no life in either .
Parsing [sent. 2080 len. 17]: The hearts of the girls sank within them , and all at once they felt tired .
Parsing [sent. 2081 len. 19]: In the air was just one sign of life : high above the lake wheeled a large fish-hawk .
Parsing [sent. 2082 len. 4]: `` Look ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2083 len. 16]: said Alister pointing ; `` there is the osprey that lives here with his wife !
Parsing [sent. 2084 len. 10]: He is just going to catch a fish ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2085 len. 24]: He had hardly spoken when the bird , with headlong descent , shot into the water , making it foam up all about .
Parsing [sent. 2086 len. 17]: He reappeared with a fish in his claws , and flew off to find his mate .
Parsing [sent. 2087 len. 9]: `` Do you know the very bird ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2088 len. 3]: asked Mercy .
Parsing [sent. 2089 len. 6]: `` I know him well .
Parsing [sent. 2090 len. 23]: He and his wife have built on that conical rock you see there in the middle of the water many years . ''
Parsing [sent. 2091 len. 8]: `` Why have you never shot him ?
Parsing [sent. 2092 len. 7]: He would look well stuffed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2093 len. 3]: said Christina .
Parsing [sent. 2094 len. 43]: She little knew the effect of her words ; the chief HATED causeless killing ; and to hear a lady talk of shooting a high-soaring creature of the air as coolly as of putting on her gloves , was nauseous to him .
Parsing [sent. 2095 len. 10]: Ian gave him praise afterwards for his unusual self-restraint .
Parsing [sent. 2096 len. 14]: But it was a moment or two ere he had himself in hand .
Parsing [sent. 2097 len. 16]: `` Do you not think he looks much better going about God 's business ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2098 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 2099 len. 16]: `` Perhaps ; but he is not yours ; you have not got him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2100 len. 7]: `` Why should I have him ?
Parsing [sent. 2101 len. 13]: He seems , indeed , the more mine the higher he goes .
Parsing [sent. 2102 len. 13]: A dead stuffed thing -- how could that be mine at all ?
Parsing [sent. 2103 len. 15]: Alive , he seems to soar in the very heaven of my soul ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2104 len. 10]: `` You showed the fox no such pity ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2105 len. 3]: remarked Mercy .
Parsing [sent. 2106 len. 11]: `` I never killed a fox to HAVE him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2107 len. 3]: answered Alister .
Parsing [sent. 2108 len. 7]: `` The osprey does no harm .
Parsing [sent. 2109 len. 25]: He eats only fish , and they are very plentiful ; he never kills birds or hares , or any creature on the land .
Parsing [sent. 2110 len. 21]: I do not see how any one could wish to kill the bird , except from mere love of destruction !
Parsing [sent. 2111 len. 12]: Why should I make a life less in the world ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2112 len. 14]: `` There would be more lives of fish -- would there not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2113 len. 3]: said Mercy .
Parsing [sent. 2114 len. 21]: `` I do n't want you to shoot the poor bird ; I only want to hear your argument ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2115 len. 13]: The chief could not immediately reply , Ian came to his rescue .
Parsing [sent. 2116 len. 11]: `` There are qualities in life , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2117 len. 19]: `` One can not think the fish-life so fine , so full of delight as the bird-life ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2118 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 2119 len. 23]: But , '' said Mercy , `` have the fishes not as good a right to their life as the birds ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2120 len. 13]: `` Both have the right given them by the maker of them .
Parsing [sent. 2121 len. 27]: The osprey was made to eat the fish , and the fish , I hope , get some good of being eaten by the osprey . ''
Parsing [sent. 2122 len. 16]: `` Excuse me , Captain Macruadh , but that seems to me simple nonsense ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2123 len. 3]: said Christina .
Parsing [sent. 2124 len. 8]: `` I hope it is true . ''
Parsing [sent. 2125 len. 16]: `` I do n't know about being true , but it must be nonsense . ''
Parsing [sent. 2126 len. 10]: `` It must seem so to most people . ''
Parsing [sent. 2127 len. 9]: `` Then why do you say it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2128 len. 9]: `` Because I hope it is true . ''
Parsing [sent. 2129 len. 11]: `` Why should you wish nonsense to be true ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2130 len. 9]: `` What is true can not be nonsense .
Parsing [sent. 2131 len. 14]: It looks nonsense only to those that take no interest in the matter .
Parsing [sent. 2132 len. 9]: Would it be nonsense to the fishes ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2133 len. 32]: `` It does seem hard , '' said Mercy , `` that the poor harmless things should be gobbled up by a creature pouncing down upon them from another element ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2134 len. 13]: `` As the poor are gobbled up everywhere by the rich ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2135 len. 7]: `` I do n't believe that .
Parsing [sent. 2136 len. 10]: The rich are very kind to the poor . ''
Parsing [sent. 2137 len. 34]: `` I beg your pardon , '' said Ian , `` but if you know no more about the rich than you do about the fish , I can hardly take your testimony .
Parsing [sent. 2138 len. 12]: The fish are the most carnivorous creatures in the world . ''
Parsing [sent. 2139 len. 8]: `` Do they eat each other ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2140 len. 4]: `` Hardly that .
Parsing [sent. 2141 len. 10]: Only the cats of Kilkenny can do that . ''
Parsing [sent. 2142 len. 8]: `` I used a common phrase ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2143 len. 20]: `` You did , and I am rude : the phrase must bear the blame for both of us .
Parsing [sent. 2144 len. 15]: But the fish are even cannibals -- eating the young of their own species !
Parsing [sent. 2145 len. 12]: They are the most destructive of creatures to other lives . ''
Parsing [sent. 2146 len. 34]: `` I suppose , '' said Mercy , `` to make one kind of creature live on another kind , is the way to get the greatest good for the greatest number ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2147 len. 20]: `` That doctrine , which seems to content most people , appears to me a poverty-stricken and selfish one .
Parsing [sent. 2148 len. 14]: I can admit nothing but the greatest good to every individual creature . ''
Parsing [sent. 2149 len. 13]: `` Do n't you think we had better be going , Mercy ?
Parsing [sent. 2150 len. 27]: It has got quite cold ; I am afraid it will rain , '' said Christina , drawing her cloak round her with a little shiver .
Parsing [sent. 2151 len. 9]: `` I am ready , '' answered Mercy .
Parsing [sent. 2152 len. 7]: The brothers looked at each other .
Parsing [sent. 2153 len. 39]: They had come out to spend the day together , but they could not leave the ladies to go home alone ; having brought them across the burn , they were bound to see them over it again !
Parsing [sent. 2154 len. 14]: An imperceptible sign passed between them , and Alister turned to the girls .
Parsing [sent. 2155 len. 15]: `` Come then , '' he said , `` we will go back ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2156 len. 10]: `` But you were not going home yet ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2157 len. 3]: said Mercy .
Parsing [sent. 2158 len. 13]: `` Would you have us leave you in this wild place ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2159 len. 9]: `` We shall find our way well enough .
Parsing [sent. 2160 len. 7]: The burn will guide us . ''
Parsing [sent. 2161 len. 21]: `` Yes ; but it will not jump over you ; it will leave you to jump over it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2162 len. 7]: `` I forgot the burn ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2163 len. 3]: said Christina .
Parsing [sent. 2164 len. 8]: `` Which way were you going ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2165 len. 16]: asked Mercy , looking all around for road or pathway over the encircling upheaved wildernesses .
Parsing [sent. 2166 len. 8]: `` This way , '' answered Ian .
Parsing [sent. 2167 len. 4]: `` Good-bye . ''
Parsing [sent. 2168 len. 8]: `` Then you are not coming ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2169 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 2170 len. 9]: My brother will take care of you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2171 len. 10]: He went straight as an arrow up the hill .
Parsing [sent. 2172 len. 7]: They stood and watched him go .
Parsing [sent. 2173 len. 16]: At what seemed the top , he turned and waved his cap , then vanished .
Parsing [sent. 2174 len. 4]: Christina felt disappointed .
Parsing [sent. 2175 len. 38]: She did not much care for either of the very peculiar young men , but any company was better than none ; a man was better than a woman ; and two men were better than one !
Parsing [sent. 2176 len. 23]: If these were not equal to admiring her as she deserved , what more remunerative labour than teaching them to do so ?
Parsing [sent. 2177 len. 18]: The thing that chiefly disappointed her in them was , that they had so little small talk .
Parsing [sent. 2178 len. 10]: It was so stupid to be always speaking sense !
Parsing [sent. 2179 len. 3]: always polite !
Parsing [sent. 2180 len. 3]: always courteous !
Parsing [sent. 2181 len. 18]: -- `` Two sir Charles Grandisons , '' she said , `` are two too many ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2182 len. 31]: And indeed the History of Sir Charles Grandison had its place in the small library free to them from childhood ; but Christina knew nothing of him except by hearsay .
Parsing [sent. 2183 len. 26]: The young men had been brought up in a solemn school -- had learned to take life as a serious and lovely and imperative thing .
Parsing [sent. 2184 len. 30]: Not the less , upon occasions of merry-making , would they frolic like young colts even yet , and that without the least reaction or sense of folly afterwards .
Parsing [sent. 2185 len. 61]: At the same time , although Ian had in the village from childhood the character , especially in the workshops of the carpenter , weaver , and shoemaker , of being ` full of humour , he was in himself always rather sad , being perplexed with many things : his humour was but the foam of his troubled sea .
Parsing [sent. 2186 len. 16]: Christina was annoyed besides that Mercy seemed not indifferent to the opinion of the men .
Parsing [sent. 2187 len. 25]: It was from pure inexperience of the man-world , she said to herself , that the silly child could see anything interesting in them !
Parsing [sent. 2188 len. 28]: GENTLEMEN she must allow them -- but of such an old-fashioned type as to be gentlemen but by courtesy -- not gentlemen in the world 's count !
Parsing [sent. 2189 len. 13]: She was of the world ; they of the north of Scotland !
Parsing [sent. 2190 len. 12]: All day Mercy had been on their side and against her !
Parsing [sent. 2191 len. 16]: It might be from sheer perversity , but she had never been like that before !
Parsing [sent. 2192 len. 13]: She must take care she did not make a fool of herself !
Parsing [sent. 2193 len. 11]: It might end in some unhappiness to the young goose !
Parsing [sent. 2194 len. 11]: Assuredly neither her father nor mother would countenance the thing !
Parsing [sent. 2195 len. 8]: She must throw herself into the breach !
Parsing [sent. 2196 len. 11]: But which of them was she taking a fancy to ?
Parsing [sent. 2197 len. 39]: She was not so anxious about her sister , however , as piqued that she had not herself gathered one expression of homage , surprised one look of admiration , seen one sign of incipient worship in either .
Parsing [sent. 2198 len. 9]: Of the two she liked better the ploughman !
Parsing [sent. 2199 len. 18]: The other was more a man of the world -- but he was not of her world !
Parsing [sent. 2200 len. 12]: With him she was a stranger in a very strange land !
Parsing [sent. 2201 len. 18]: Christina 's world was a very small one , and in its temple stood her own image .
Parsing [sent. 2202 len. 6]: Ian belonged to the universe .
Parsing [sent. 2203 len. 9]: He was a gentleman of the high court .
Parsing [sent. 2204 len. 15]: Wherever he might go throughout God 's worlds , he would be at home .
Parsing [sent. 2205 len. 11]: How could there be much attraction between Christina and him ?
Parsing [sent. 2206 len. 15]: Alister was more talkative on the way back than he had been all day .
Parsing [sent. 2207 len. 33]: Christina thought the change caused by having them , or rather her , to himself alone ; but in reality it sprang from the prospect of soon rejoining his brother without them .
Parsing [sent. 2208 len. 42]: Some of the things he said , Mercy found well worth hearing ; and an old Scotch ballad which he repeated , having learned it of a lowland nurse , appeared to her as beautiful as it was wild and strange .
Parsing [sent. 2209 len. 13]: For Christina , she despised the Scotch language : it was vulgar !
Parsing [sent. 2210 len. 42]: Had Alister informed her that Beowulf , `` the most important of all the relics of the Pagan Anglo-Saxon , is written in undeniable Scotch , the English of the period , '' it would have made no difference to Christina !
Parsing [sent. 2211 len. 4]: Why should it ?
Parsing [sent. 2212 len. 30]: She had never yet cared for any book beyond the novels of a certain lady which , to speak with due restraint , do not tend to profitable thought .
Parsing [sent. 2213 len. 29]: At the same time , it was not for the worst in them that she liked them ; she did not understand them well enough to see it .
Parsing [sent. 2214 len. 37]: But there was ground to fear that , when she came to understand , shocked at first , she would speedily get accustomed to it , and at length like them all the better for it .
Parsing [sent. 2215 len. 62]: In Mercy 's unawakened soul , echoed now and then a faint thrill of response to some of the things Alister said , and , oftener , to some of the verses he repeated ; and she would look up at him when he was silent , with an unconscious seeking glance , as if dimly aware of a beneficent presence .
Parsing [sent. 2216 len. 41]: Alister was drawn by the honest gaze of her yet undeveloped and homely countenance , with its child-look in process of sublimation , whence the woman would glance out and vanish again , leaving the child to give disappointing answers .
Parsing [sent. 2217 len. 27]: There was something in it of the look a dog casts up out of his beautiful brown eyes into the mystery of his master 's countenance .
Parsing [sent. 2218 len. 22]: She was on the edge of coming awake ; all was darkness about her , but something was pulling at her !
Parsing [sent. 2219 len. 22]: She had never known before that a lady might be lovely in a ballad as well as in a beautiful gown !
Parsing [sent. 2220 len. 29]: Finding himself so listened to , though the listener was little more than a child , the heart of the chief began to swell in his great bosom .
Parsing [sent. 2221 len. 7]: Like a child he was pleased .
Parsing [sent. 2222 len. 20]: The gray day about him grew sweet ; its very grayness was sweet , and of a silvery sheen .
Parsing [sent. 2223 len. 38]: When they arrived at the burn , and , easily enough from that side , he had handed them across , he was not quite so glad to turn from them as he had expected to be .
Parsing [sent. 2224 len. 6]: `` Are you going ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2225 len. 14]: said Christina with genuine surprise , for she had not understood his intention .
Parsing [sent. 2226 len. 11]: `` The way is easy now , '' he answered .
Parsing [sent. 2227 len. 29]: `` I am sorry to leave you , but I have to join Ian , and the twilight will be flickering down before I reach the place . ''
Parsing [sent. 2228 len. 9]: `` And there will be no moon ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2229 len. 14]: said Mercy : `` how will you get home through the darkness ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2230 len. 11]: `` We do not mean to come home to-night . ''
Parsing [sent. 2231 len. 12]: `` Oh , then , you are going to friends ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2232 len. 16]: `` No ; we shall be with each other -- not a soul besides . ''
Parsing [sent. 2233 len. 12]: `` There ca n't surely be a hotel up there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2234 len. 21]: Alister laughed as he answered , `` There are more ways than one of spending a night on the hills .
Parsing [sent. 2235 len. 41]: If you look from a window -- in that direction , '' he said , pointing , `` the last thing before you go to bed , you will see that at least we shall not perish with cold . ''
Parsing [sent. 2236 len. 25]: He sprang again over the burn , and with a wave of his bonnet , went , like Ian , straight up the hill .
Parsing [sent. 2237 len. 42]: The girls stood for some time watching him climb as if he had been going up a flight of stairs , until he stood clear against the sky , when , with another wave of his bonnet , he too disappeared .
Parsing [sent. 2238 len. 16]: Mercy did not forget to look from her window in the direction Alister had indicated .
Parsing [sent. 2239 len. 60]: There was no room to mistake what he meant , for through the dark ran a great opening to the side of a hill , somewhere in the night , where glowed and flamed , reddening the air , a huge crescent of fire , slowly climbing , like a column of attack , up toward the invisible crest .
Parsing [sent. 2240 len. 7]: `` What does it mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2241 len. 5]: she said to herself .
Parsing [sent. 2242 len. 17]: `` Why do they make such a bonfire -- with nobody but themselves to enjoy it ?
Parsing [sent. 2243 len. 17]: What strange men -- out by themselves in the dark night , on the cold hill !
Parsing [sent. 2244 len. 8]: What can they be doing it for ?
Parsing [sent. 2245 len. 8]: I hope they have something to eat !
Parsing [sent. 2246 len. 8]: I SHOULD like to hear them talk !
Parsing [sent. 2247 len. 9]: I wonder what they are saying about US !
Parsing [sent. 2248 len. 8]: I am certain we bored them ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2249 len. 38]: The brothers did speak of them , and readily agreed in some notion of their characters ; but they soon turned to other things , and there passed a good deal that Mercy could not have followed .
Parsing [sent. 2250 len. 39]: What would she , for instance , have made of Alister 's challenge to his brother to explain the metaphysical necessity for the sine , tangent , and secant of an angle belonging to its supplement as well ?
Parsing [sent. 2251 len. 50]: When the ladies overtook them in the morning , Alister was reading , from an old manuscript volume of his brother 's which he had found in a chest , a certain very early attempt at humour , and now they disputed concerning it as they watched the fire .
Parsing [sent. 2252 len. 24]: It had abundance of faults , and in especial lacked suture , but will serve to show something of lan 's youthful ingenium .
Parsing [sent. 2253 len. 4]: TO A VAGRANT .
Parsing [sent. 2254 len. 11]: Gentle vagrant , stumping over Several verdant fields of clover !
Parsing [sent. 2255 len. 5]: Subject of unnumbered knockings !
Parsing [sent. 2256 len. 18]: Tattered ' coat and ragged stockings , Slouching hat and roving eye , Tell of SETTLED vagrancy !
Parsing [sent. 2257 len. 13]: Wretched wanderer , can it be The poor laws have leaguered thee ?
Parsing [sent. 2258 len. 41]: Hear ` st thou , in thy thorny den , Tramp of rural policemen , Inly fancying , in thy rear Coats of blue and buttons clear , While to meet thee , in the van Stalks some vengeful alderman ?
Parsing [sent. 2259 len. 14]: -- Each separate sense bringing a notion Of forms that teach thee locomotion !
Parsing [sent. 2260 len. 103]: Beat and battered altogether , By fellow-men , by wind and weather ; Hounded on through fens and bogs , Chased by men and bit by dogs : And , in thy weakly way of judging , So kindly taught the art of trudging ; Or , with a moment 's happier lot , Pitied , pensioned , and forgot -- Cutty-pipe thy regium donum ; Poverty thy summum bonum ; Thy frigid couch a sandstone stratum ; A colder grave thy ultimatum ; Circumventing , circumvented ; In short , excessively tormented , Everything combines to scare Charity 's dear pensioner !
Parsing [sent. 2261 len. 18]: -- Say , vagrant , can ` st thou grant to me A slice of thy philosophy ?
Parsing [sent. 2262 len. 40]: Haply , in thy many trudgings , Having found unchallenged lodgings , Thy thoughts , unused to saddle-crupper , Ambling no farther than thy supper -- Thou , by the light of heaven-lit taper , Mendest thy prospective paper !
Parsing [sent. 2263 len. 45]: Then , jolly pauper , stitch till day ; Let not thy roses drop away , Lest , begrimed with muddy matter , Thy body peep from every tatter , And men -- a charitable dose -- Should physic thee with food and clothes !
Parsing [sent. 2264 len. 4]: Nursling of adversity !
Parsing [sent. 2265 len. 12]: 'T is thy glory thus to be Sinking fund of raggery !
Parsing [sent. 2266 len. 16]: Thus to scrape a nation 's dishes , And fatten on a few good wishes !
Parsing [sent. 2267 len. 24]: Or , on some venial treason bent , Frame thyself a government , For thy crest a brirnless hat , Poverty 's aristocrat !
Parsing [sent. 2268 len. 11]: Nonne habeam te tristem , Planet of the human system ?
Parsing [sent. 2269 len. 57]: Comet lank and melancholic -- Orbit shocking parabolic -- Seen for a little in the sky Of the world of sympathy -- Seldom failing when predicted , Coming most when most restricted , Dragging a nebulous tail with thee Of hypothetic vagrancy -- Of vagrants large , and vagrants small , Vagrants scarce visible at all !
Parsing [sent. 2270 len. 5]: Matchless oracle of woe !
Parsing [sent. 2271 len. 4]: Anarchy in embryo !
Parsing [sent. 2272 len. 5]: Strange antipodes of bliss !
Parsing [sent. 2273 len. 4]: Parody on happiness !
Parsing [sent. 2274 len. 6]: Baghouse of the great creation !
Parsing [sent. 2275 len. 39]: Subject meet for strangulation , By practice tutored to condense The cautious inquiry for pence , And skilful , with averted eye , To hide thy latent roguery -- Lo , on thy hopes I clap a stopper !
Parsing [sent. 2276 len. 8]: Vagrant , thou shalt have no copper !
Parsing [sent. 2277 len. 14]: Gather thy stumps , and get thee hence , Unwise solicitor of pence !
Parsing [sent. 2278 len. 48]: Alister , who all but worshipped Ian , and cherished every scrap from his pen , had not until quite lately seen this foolish production , as Ian counted it , and was delighted with it , as he would have been had it been much worse .
Parsing [sent. 2279 len. 33]: Ian was vexed that he should like it , and now spent the greater part of an hour trying to show him how very bad in parts , even senseless it was .
Parsing [sent. 2280 len. 24]: Profusion of epithets without applicability , want of continuity , purposelessness , silliness , heartlessness -- were but a few of his denunciations .
Parsing [sent. 2281 len. 47]: Alister argued it was but a bit of fun , and that anybody that knew Ian , knew perfectly he would never amuse himself with a fellow without giving him something , but it was in vain ; Ian was bent on showing it altogether unworthy .
Parsing [sent. 2282 len. 29]: So , not to waste the night , they dropped the dispute , and by the light of the blazing heather , turned to a chapter of Boethius .
Parsing [sent. 2283 len. 3]: CHAPTER XIV .
Parsing [sent. 2284 len. 3]: THE WOLVES .
Parsing [sent. 2285 len. 39]: My readers may remember that Ian was on the point of acquainting his mother with an important event in his spiritual history , when they were interrupted by the involuntary call of the girls from the New House .
Parsing [sent. 2286 len. 69]: The mother , as will readily be believed , remained desirous of listening to her son 's story , though dreading it would not be of a kind to give her much satisfaction ; but partly from preventions -- favoured , it must be confessed by Ian , and yet more from direct avoidance on his part , the days passed without her hearing anything more of it .
Parsing [sent. 2287 len. 53]: Ian had in truth almost repented his offer of the narrative : a certain vague assurance that it would not be satisfactory to her , had grown upon him until he felt it unkind to lay before her an experience whose narration would seem to ask a sympathy she could not give .
Parsing [sent. 2288 len. 11]: But the mother was unable to let the thing rest .
Parsing [sent. 2289 len. 10]: More than by interest she was urged by anxiety .
Parsing [sent. 2290 len. 45]: In spite of her ungodlike theories of God , it was impossible she could be in despair about her noble Ian ; still , her hope was at best founded on the uncovenanted mercies of God , not on the security of his bond !
Parsing [sent. 2291 len. 53]: She did not believe that God was doing and would do his best for every man ; therefore she had no assurance that he would bring down the pride of Ian , and compel his acceptance of terms worthy of an old Roman father , half law-circumventing lawyer , half heartless tyrant .
Parsing [sent. 2292 len. 42]: But her longing to hear what her son had proposed telling her , was chiefly inspired by the hope of getting nearer to him , of closer sympathy becoming possible between them through her learning more clearly what his views were .
Parsing [sent. 2293 len. 61]: She constantly felt as if walking along the side of a thick hedge , with occasional thinnesses through which now and then she gained a ghostly glimpse of her heart 's treasure gliding along the other side -- close to her , yet so far that , when they spoke , they seemed calling across a gulf of dividing darkness .
Parsing [sent. 2294 len. 56]: Therefore , the night after that spent by her sons on the hill , all having retired some two hours before , the mother , finding herself unable to sleep , rose as she had often done ere now , and stole to the door of the little room under the thatch where Ian lay .
Parsing [sent. 2295 len. 19]: Listening , and judging him awake , she went softly in , and sat down by his bedside .
Parsing [sent. 2296 len. 33]: There had been such occasions on which , though son as well as mother was wide awake , neither spoke a word ; but this time the mother could not be silent .
Parsing [sent. 2297 len. 20]: `` You never told me , Ian , the story you began about something that made you pray ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2298 len. 19]: Ian saw he could not now draw back without causing , her more trouble than would the narration .
Parsing [sent. 2299 len. 13]: `` Are you sure you will not take cold mother dear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2300 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 2301 len. 29]: `` I am warmly clad , my son ; and my heart , more than I can tell you , is longing to hear all about it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2302 len. 19]: `` I am afraid you will not find my story so interesting as you expect , mother ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2303 len. 20]: `` What concerns you is more interesting to me than anything else in the whole world , Ian . ''
Parsing [sent. 2304 len. 9]: `` Not more than God , mother ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2305 len. 3]: said Ian .
Parsing [sent. 2306 len. 5]: The mother was silent .
Parsing [sent. 2307 len. 8]: She was as honest as her sons .
Parsing [sent. 2308 len. 88]: The question , dim-lucent , showed her , if but in shadow , something of the truth concerning herself -- not so that she could grasp it , for she saw it as in a glimmer , a fluctuating , vanishing flash -- namely , that she cared more about salvation than about God -- that , if she could but keep her boy out of hell , she would be content to live on without any nearer approach to him in whom she had her being !
Parsing [sent. 2309 len. 14]: God was to her an awe , not a ceaseless , growing delight !
Parsing [sent. 2310 len. 40]: There are centuries of paganism yet in many lovely Christian souls -- paganism so deep , therefore so little recognized , that their earnest endeavour is to plant that paganism ineradicably in the hearts of those dearest to them .
Parsing [sent. 2311 len. 24]: As she did not answer , Ian was afraid she was hurt , and thought it better to begin his story at once .
Parsing [sent. 2312 len. 39]: `` It was one night in the middle of winter -- last winter , near Moscow , '' he began , `` and the frost was very bitter -- the worst night for cold I have ever known .
Parsing [sent. 2313 len. 15]: I had gone with a companion into the depth of a great pine forest .
Parsing [sent. 2314 len. 29]: On our way , the cold grew so intense , that we took refuge at a little public-house , frequented by peasants and persons of the lowest ranks .
Parsing [sent. 2315 len. 17]: On entering I saw a scene which surpassed all for interest I had ever before witnessed .
Parsing [sent. 2316 len. 24]: The little lonely house was crammed with Russian soldiers , fierce-looking fellows , and I daresay their number formed our protection from violence .
Parsing [sent. 2317 len. 14]: Many of them were among the finest looking fellows I have ever seen .
Parsing [sent. 2318 len. 33]: They were half drunk , and were dancing and singing with the wildest gesticulations and grimaces ; but such singing for strange wildness and harmony combined I had never before listened to .
Parsing [sent. 2319 len. 35]: One would keep up a solo for some minutes , when the whole company would join in a sort of chorus , dancing frantically about , but with the most perfect regularity of movement .
Parsing [sent. 2320 len. 26]: One of them came up to me and with a low bow begged me in the name of the rest to give them some money .
Parsing [sent. 2321 len. 45]: I accordingly gave them a silver ruble , upon which the whole party set up a shout , surrounded me , and in a moment a score of brawny fellows had lifted me in the air , where I was borne along in triumph .
Parsing [sent. 2322 len. 33]: I took off my cap and gave three hip-hip-hurrahs as loud as my lungs could bawl , whereupon , with the profoundest expressions of gratitude , I was lowered from my elevation .
Parsing [sent. 2323 len. 39]: One of them then who seemed to be the spokesman of the rest , seized me in his arms and gave me a hearty kiss on the cheek , on which I took my departure amid universal acclamation .
Parsing [sent. 2324 len. 35]: -- But all that 's not worth telling you about ; it was not for that I began -- only the scene came up so clear before me that it drew me aside . ''
Parsing [sent. 2325 len. 48]: `` I do n't need to tell you , Ian , '' said his mother , with shining eyes , `` that if it were only what you had to eat on the most ordinary day of your life , it would be interesting to me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2326 len. 33]: `` Thank you , mother dear ; I seem to know that without being told ; but I could never talk to you about anything that was not interesting to myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 2327 len. 4]: Here he paused .
Parsing [sent. 2328 len. 6]: He would rather have stopped .
Parsing [sent. 2329 len. 9]: `` Go on , go on , Ian .
Parsing [sent. 2330 len. 7]: I am longing to hear . ''
Parsing [sent. 2331 len. 7]: `` Well -- where was I ?
Parsing [sent. 2332 len. 78]: -- We left at the inn our carriage and horses , and went with our guns far into the forest -- all of straight , tall pines , up and up ; and the Little island-like tops of them , which , if there be a breath of wind , are sure to be swaying about like the motion of a dream , were as still as the big frosty stars in the deep blue overhead . ''
Parsing [sent. 2333 len. 18]: `` What did you want in such a lonely place at that time of the night ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2334 len. 4]: asked the mother .
Parsing [sent. 2335 len. 65]: She sat with firm-closed lips , and wide , night-filled eyes looking at her son , the fear of love in her beautiful face -- a face more beautiful than any other that son had yet seen , fit window for a heart so full of refuge to look out of ; and he knew how she looked though the darkness was between them .
Parsing [sent. 2336 len. 9]: `` Wolves , mother , '' he answered .
Parsing [sent. 2337 len. 3]: She shuddered .
Parsing [sent. 2338 len. 35]: She was a great reader in the long winter nights , and had read terrible stories of wolves -- the last of which in Scotland had been killed not far from where they sat .
Parsing [sent. 2339 len. 12]: `` What did you want with the wolves , Ian ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2340 len. 3]: she faltered .
Parsing [sent. 2341 len. 7]: `` To kill them , mother .
Parsing [sent. 2342 len. 25]: I never liked killing animals any more than Alister ; but even he destroys the hooded crow ; and wolves are yet fairer game .
Parsing [sent. 2343 len. 40]: They are the out-of-door devils of that country , and I fancy devils do go into them sometimes , as they did once into the poor swine : they are the terror of all who live near the forests .
Parsing [sent. 2344 len. 50]: `` There was no moon -- only star-light ; but whenever we came to any opener space , there was light enough from the snow to see all about ; there was light indeed from the snow all through the forest , but the trees were thick and dark .
Parsing [sent. 2345 len. 33]: Far away , somewhere in the mystery of the black wood , we could now and then hear a faint howling : it came from the red throats of the wolves . ''
Parsing [sent. 2346 len. 9]: `` You are frightening me , Ian ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2347 len. 16]: said the mother , as if they had been two children telling each other tales .
Parsing [sent. 2348 len. 19]: `` Indeed , mother , they are very horrible when they hunt in droves , ravenous with hunger .
Parsing [sent. 2349 len. 20]: To kill one of them , if it be but one , is to do something for your kind .
Parsing [sent. 2350 len. 61]: And just at that time I was oppressed with the feeling that I had done and was doing nothing for my people -- my own humans ; and not knowing anything else I could at the moment attempt , I resolved to go and kill a wolf or two : they had killed a poor woman only two nights before .
Parsing [sent. 2351 len. 20]: `` As soon as we could after hearing the noise of them , we got up into two trees .
Parsing [sent. 2352 len. 31]: It took us some time to discover two that were fit for our purpose , and we did not get them so near each other as we should have liked .
Parsing [sent. 2353 len. 52]: It was rather anxious work too until we found them , for if we encountered on foot a pack of those demons , we could be but a moment or two alive : killing one , ten would be upon us , and a hundred more on the backs of those .
Parsing [sent. 2354 len. 46]: But we hoped they would smell us up in the trees , and search for us , when we should be able to give account of a few of them at least : we had double-barrelled guns , and plenty of powder and ball . ''
Parsing [sent. 2355 len. 17]: `` But how could you endure the cold -- at night -- and without food ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2356 len. 11]: `` No , mother ; we did not try that !
Parsing [sent. 2357 len. 9]: We had plenty to eat in our pockets .
Parsing [sent. 2358 len. 17]: My companion had a bottle of vodki , and -- '' `` What is that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2359 len. 6]: asked the mother with suspicion .
Parsing [sent. 2360 len. 16]: `` A sort of raw spirit -- horrible stuff -- more like spirits of wine .
Parsing [sent. 2361 len. 11]: They say it does not hurt in such cold . ''
Parsing [sent. 2362 len. 6]: `` But , Ian ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2363 len. 11]: cried the mother , and seemed unable to say more .
Parsing [sent. 2364 len. 9]: `` Do n't be frightened , mother ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2365 len. 8]: said Ian , with a merry laugh .
Parsing [sent. 2366 len. 14]: `` Surely you do not imagine _ I _ would drink such stuff !
Parsing [sent. 2367 len. 14]: True , I had my bottle , but it was full of tea .
Parsing [sent. 2368 len. 18]: The Russians drink enormous quantities of tea -- though not so strong as you make it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2369 len. 12]: `` Go on , then , Ian ; go on . ''
Parsing [sent. 2370 len. 19]: `` We sat a long time , and there was no sign of the wolves coming near us .
Parsing [sent. 2371 len. 13]: It was very cold , but our furs kept in our warmth .
Parsing [sent. 2372 len. 33]: By and by I fell asleep -- which was not dangerous so long as I kept warm , and I thought the cold must wake me before it began to numb me .
Parsing [sent. 2373 len. 33]: And as ' I slept I dreamed ; but my dream did not change the place ; the forest , the tree I was in , all my surroundings were the same .
Parsing [sent. 2374 len. 18]: I even dreamed that I came awake , and saw everything about me just as it was .
Parsing [sent. 2375 len. 33]: I seemed to open my eyes , and look about me on the dazzling snow from my perch : I was in a small tree on the border of a little clearing .
Parsing [sent. 2376 len. 26]: `` Suddenly , out of the wood to my left , issued something , running fast , but with soundless feet , over the snow .
Parsing [sent. 2377 len. 17]: I doubted in my dream whether the object were a live thing or only a shadow .
Parsing [sent. 2378 len. 23]: It came nearer , and I saw it was a child , a little girl , running as if for her life .
Parsing [sent. 2379 len. 52]: She came straight to the tree I sat in , and when close to it , but without a moment 's halt , looked up , and I saw a sweet little face , white with terror -- which somehow seemed , however , not for herself , but for me .
Parsing [sent. 2380 len. 44]: I called out after her to stop , and I would take her into the tree beside me , where the wolves could not reach her ; but she only shook her head , and ran on over the clearing into the forest .
Parsing [sent. 2381 len. 22]: Among the holes I watched the fleeting shape appear and disappear and appear again , until I saw it no more .
Parsing [sent. 2382 len. 16]: Then first I heard another kind of howl from the wolves -- that of pursuit .
Parsing [sent. 2383 len. 40]: It strengthened and swelled , growing nearer and nearer , till at last , through the stillness of the night and the moveless forest and the dead snow , came to my ear a kind of soft rushing sound .
Parsing [sent. 2384 len. 9]: I do n't know how to describe it .
Parsing [sent. 2385 len. 35]: The rustle of dry leaves is too sharp ; it was like a very soft heavy rain on a window -- a small dull padding padding : it was the feet of the wolves .
Parsing [sent. 2386 len. 18]: They came nearer and grew louder and louder , but the noise was still muffled and soft .
Parsing [sent. 2387 len. 11]: Their howling , however , was now loud and horrid .
Parsing [sent. 2388 len. 50]: I suppose they can not help howling ; if they could , they would have too much power over poor creatures , coming upon them altogether at unawares ; but as it is , they tell , whether they will or no , that they are upon the way .
Parsing [sent. 2389 len. 38]: At length , dark as a torrent of pitch , out of the forest flowed a multitude of obscure things , and streamed away , black over the snow , in the direction the child had taken .
Parsing [sent. 2390 len. 27]: They passed close to the foot of my tree , but did not even look up , flitting by like a shadow whose substance was unseen .
Parsing [sent. 2391 len. 15]: Where the child had vanished they also disappeared : plainly they were after her !
Parsing [sent. 2392 len. 9]: `` It was only a dream , mother !
Parsing [sent. 2393 len. 26]: do n't be so frightened , '' interrupted lan , for here his mother gave a little cry , almost forgetting what the narration was .
Parsing [sent. 2394 len. 17]: `` Then first , '' he went on , `` I seemed to recover my self-possession .
Parsing [sent. 2395 len. 41]: I saw that , though I must certainly be devoured by the wolves , and the child could not escape , I had no choice but go down and follow , do what I could , and die with her .
Parsing [sent. 2396 len. 26]: Down I was the same instant , running as I had never run before even in a dream , along the track of the wolves .
Parsing [sent. 2397 len. 35]: As I ran , I heard their howling , but it seemed so far off that I could not hope to be in time to kill one of them ere they were upon her .
Parsing [sent. 2398 len. 20]: Still , by their howling , it did not appear they had reached her , and I ran on .
Parsing [sent. 2399 len. 31]: Their noise grew louder and louder , but I seemed to run miles and miles , wondering what spell was upon me that I could not come up with them .
Parsing [sent. 2400 len. 13]: All at once the clamour grew hideous , and I saw them .
Parsing [sent. 2401 len. 30]: They were gathered round a tree , in a clearing just like that I had left , and were madly leaping against it , but ever falling back baffled .
Parsing [sent. 2402 len. 26]: I looked up : in the top of the tree sat the little girl , her white face looking down upon them with a smile .
Parsing [sent. 2403 len. 8]: All the terror had vanished from it .
Parsing [sent. 2404 len. 25]: It was still white as the snow , but like the snow was radiating a white light through the dark foliage of the fir .
Parsing [sent. 2405 len. 15]: I see it often , mother , so clear that I could paint it .
Parsing [sent. 2406 len. 7]: I was enchanted at the sight .
Parsing [sent. 2407 len. 24]: But she was not in safety yet , and I rushed into the heap of wolves , striking and stabbing with my hunting-knife .
Parsing [sent. 2408 len. 14]: I got to the tree , and was by her in a moment .
Parsing [sent. 2409 len. 20]: But as I took the child in my arms I woke , and knew that it was a dream .
Parsing [sent. 2410 len. 24]: I sat in my own tree , and up against the stem of it broke a howling , surging black wave of wolves .
Parsing [sent. 2411 len. 12]: They leaped at the tree-bole as a rock-checked billow would leap .
Parsing [sent. 2412 len. 15]: My gun was to my shoulder in a moment , and blazed among them .
Parsing [sent. 2413 len. 5]: Howls of death arose .
Parsing [sent. 2414 len. 12]: Their companions fell upon the wounded , and ate them up .
Parsing [sent. 2415 len. 24]: The tearing and yelling at the foot of the tree was like the tumult of devils full of hate and malice and greed .
Parsing [sent. 2416 len. 19]: Then for the first time I thought whether such creatures might not be the open haunts of demons .
Parsing [sent. 2417 len. 33]: I do not imagine that , when those our Lord drove out of the man asked permission to go into the swine , they desired anything unheard of before in the demon-world .
Parsing [sent. 2418 len. 102]: I think they were not in the way of going into tame animals ; but , as they must go out of the man , as they greatly dreaded the abyss of the disembodied , and as no ferocious animals fit to harbour them were near , they begged leave to go into such as were accessible , though unsuitable ; whereupon the natural consequence followed : their presence made the poor swine miserable even to madness , and with the instinct of so many maniacs that in death alone lies their deliverance , they rushed straight into the loch . ''
Parsing [sent. 2419 len. 8]: `` It may be so , Ian !
Parsing [sent. 2420 len. 14]: But I want to hear how you got away from the wolves . ''
Parsing [sent. 2421 len. 42]: `` I fired and fired ; and still they kept rushing on the tree-hole , heaping themselves against it , those behind struggling up on the backs of those next it , in a storm of rage and hunger and jealousy .
Parsing [sent. 2422 len. 52]: Not a few who had just helped to eat some of their fellows , were themselves eaten in turn , and not a scrap of them left ; but it was a large pack , and it would have taken a long time to kill enough to satisfy those that remained .
Parsing [sent. 2423 len. 22]: I killed and killed until my ammunition was gone , and then there was nothing for it but await the light .
Parsing [sent. 2424 len. 26]: When the morning began to dawn , they answered its light with silence , and turning away swept like a shadow back into the wood .
Parsing [sent. 2425 len. 24]: Strange to tell , I heard afterwards that a child had been killed by them in the earlier part of that same night .
Parsing [sent. 2426 len. 23]: But even now sometimes , as I lie awake , I grow almost doubtful whether the whole was not a hideous dream .
Parsing [sent. 2427 len. 32]: `` Not the less for that was what I went through between the time my powder came to an end and the dawn of the morning , a real spiritual fact .
Parsing [sent. 2428 len. 43]: `` In the midst of the howling I grew so sleepy that the horrible noise itself seemed to lull me while it kept me awake , and I fell into a kind of reverie with which my dream came back and mingled .
Parsing [sent. 2429 len. 87]: I seemed to be sitting in the tree with the little shining girl , and she was my own soul ; and all the wrong things I had in me , and all the wrong things I had done , with all the weaknesses and evil tendencies of my nature , whether mine by fault or by inheritance , had taken shape , and , in the persons of the howling wolves below , were besieging me , to get at me , and devour me .
Parsing [sent. 2430 len. 6]: Suddenly my soul was gone .
Parsing [sent. 2431 len. 46]: Above were the still , bright stars , shining unmoved ; beneath was the white , betraying snow , and the howling wolves ; away through the forest was fleeting , ever fleeting , my poor soul , in the likeness of a white-faced child !
Parsing [sent. 2432 len. 25]: All at once came a great stillness , as of a desert place , where breathed nor life of man nor life of beast .
Parsing [sent. 2433 len. 15]: I was alone , frightfully alone -- alone as I had never been before .
Parsing [sent. 2434 len. 37]: The creatures at the foot of the tree were still howling , but their cry sounded far away and small ; they were in some story I had been reading , not anywhere in my life !
Parsing [sent. 2435 len. 10]: I was left and lost -- left by whom ?
Parsing [sent. 2436 len. 5]: -- lost by whom ?
Parsing [sent. 2437 len. 14]: -- in the waste of my own being , without stay or comfort .
Parsing [sent. 2438 len. 35]: I looked up to the sky ; it was infinite -- yet only a part of myself , and much too near to afford me any refuge from the desert of my lost self .
Parsing [sent. 2439 len. 19]: It came down nearer ; the limitless space came down , and clasped me , and held me .
Parsing [sent. 2440 len. 22]: It came close to me -- as if I had been a shape off which all nature was taking a mould .
Parsing [sent. 2441 len. 8]: I was at once everything and nothing .
Parsing [sent. 2442 len. 10]: I can not tell you how frightful it was !
Parsing [sent. 2443 len. 14]: In agony I cried to God , with a cry of utter despair .
Parsing [sent. 2444 len. 35]: I can not say whether I may believe that he answered me ; I know this , that a great quiet fell upon me -- but a quiet as of utter defeat and helplessness .
Parsing [sent. 2445 len. 37]: Then again , I can not tell how , the quiet and the helplessness melted away into a sense of God -- a feeling as if great space all about me was God and not emptiness .
Parsing [sent. 2446 len. 7]: Wolf nor sin could touch me !
Parsing [sent. 2447 len. 11]: I was a wide peace -- my very being peace !
Parsing [sent. 2448 len. 34]: And in my mind -- whether an echo from the Bible , I do not know -- were the words : -- ` I , even I , am he that comforteth thee .
Parsing [sent. 2449 len. 8]: I am God , thy saviour ! '
Parsing [sent. 2450 len. 20]: Whereas I had seemed all alone , I was with God , the only withness man can really share !
Parsing [sent. 2451 len. 22]: I lifted my eyes ; morning was in the east , and the wolves were slinking away over the snow . ''
Parsing [sent. 2452 len. 12]: How to receive the strange experience the mother did not know .
Parsing [sent. 2453 len. 12]: She ought to say something , for she sorely questioned it !
Parsing [sent. 2454 len. 25]: Not a word had he spoken belonging to the religion in which she had brought him up , except two -- SIN and GOD !
Parsing [sent. 2455 len. 9]: There was nothing in it about the atonement !
Parsing [sent. 2456 len. 20]: She did not see that it was a dream , say rather a vision , of the atonement itself .
Parsing [sent. 2457 len. 14]: To Ian her interpretation of the atonement seemed an everlasting and hopeless severance .
Parsing [sent. 2458 len. 38]: The patience of God must surely be far more tried by those who would interpret him , than by those who deny him : the latter speak lies against him , the former speak lies for him !
Parsing [sent. 2459 len. 42]: Yet all the time the mother felt as in the presence of some creature of a higher world -- one above the ordinary race of men -- whom the powers of evil had indeed misled , but perhaps not finally snared .
Parsing [sent. 2460 len. 27]: She little thought how near she was to imagining that good may come out of evil -- that there is good which is not of God !
Parsing [sent. 2461 len. 38]: She did not yet understand that salvation lies in being one with Christ , even as the branch is one with the vine ; -- that any salvation short of knowing God is no salvation at all .
Parsing [sent. 2462 len. 26]: What moment a man feels that he belongs to God utterly , the atonement is there , the son of God is reaping his harvest .
Parsing [sent. 2463 len. 51]: The good mother was not , however , one of those conceited , stiff-necked , power-loving souls who have been the curse and ruin of the church in all ages ; she was but one of those in whom reverence for its passing form dulls the perception of unchangeable truth .
Parsing [sent. 2464 len. 35]: They shut up God 's precious light in the horn lantern of human theory , and the lantern casts such shadows on the path to the kingdom as seem to dim eyes insurmountable obstructions .
Parsing [sent. 2465 len. 33]: For the sake of what they count revealed , they refuse all further revelation , and what satisfies them is merest famine to the next generation of the children of the kingdom .
Parsing [sent. 2466 len. 29]: Instead of God 's truth they offer man 's theory , and accuse of rebellion against God such as can not live on the husks they call food .
Parsing [sent. 2467 len. 6]: But ah , home-hungry soul !
Parsing [sent. 2468 len. 40]: thy God is not the elder brother of the parable , but the father with the best robe and the ring -- a God high above all thy longing , even as the heavens are high above the earth .
Parsing [sent. 2469 len. 3]: CHAPTER XV .
Parsing [sent. 2470 len. 5]: THE GULF THAT DIVIDED .
Parsing [sent. 2471 len. 16]: When Ian ceased , a silence deep as the darkness around , fell upon them .
Parsing [sent. 2472 len. 39]: To Ian , the silence seemed the very voice of God , clear in the darkness ; to the mother it was a darkness interpenetrating the darkness ; it was a great gulf between her and her boy .
Parsing [sent. 2473 len. 13]: She must cry to him aloud , but what should she cry ?
Parsing [sent. 2474 len. 24]: If she did not , an opportunity , perhaps the last , on which hung eternal issues , would be gone for ever !
Parsing [sent. 2475 len. 19]: Each moment 's delay was a disobedience to her conscience , a yielding to love 's sinful reluctance !
Parsing [sent. 2476 len. 21]: With `` sick assay '' she heaved at the weight on her heart , but not a word would come .
Parsing [sent. 2477 len. 16]: If Ian would but speak again , and break the spell of the terrible stillness !
Parsing [sent. 2478 len. 12]: She must die in eternal wrong if she did not speak !
Parsing [sent. 2479 len. 6]: But no word would come .
Parsing [sent. 2480 len. 7]: Something in her would not move .
Parsing [sent. 2481 len. 26]: It was not in her brain or her lips or her tongue , for she knew all the time she could speak if she would .
Parsing [sent. 2482 len. 12]: The caitiff will was not all on the side of duty !
Parsing [sent. 2483 len. 7]: She was not FOR the truth !
Parsing [sent. 2484 len. 9]: -- could she then be OF the truth ?
Parsing [sent. 2485 len. 15]: She did not suspect a divine reluctance to urge that which was not good .
Parsing [sent. 2486 len. 28]: Not always when the will works may we lay hold of it in the act : somehow , she knew not how , she heard herself speaking .
Parsing [sent. 2487 len. 11]: `` Are you sure it was God , Ian ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2488 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 2489 len. 22]: The voice she heard was weak and broken , reedy and strained , like the voice of one all but dead .
Parsing [sent. 2490 len. 17]: `` No , mother , '' answered Ian , `` but I hope it was . ''
Parsing [sent. 2491 len. 14]: `` Hopes , my dear hoy , are not to be trusted . ''
Parsing [sent. 2492 len. 16]: `` That is true , mother ; and yet we are saved by hope . ''
Parsing [sent. 2493 len. 8]: `` We are saved by faith . ''
Parsing [sent. 2494 len. 8]: `` I do not doubt it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2495 len. 6]: `` You rejoice my heart .
Parsing [sent. 2496 len. 6]: But faith in what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2497 len. 8]: `` Faith in God , mother . ''
Parsing [sent. 2498 len. 8]: `` That will not save you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2499 len. 8]: `` No , but God will . ''
Parsing [sent. 2500 len. 11]: `` The devils believe in God , and tremble . ''
Parsing [sent. 2501 len. 16]: `` I believe in the father of Jesus Christ , and do not tremble . ''
Parsing [sent. 2502 len. 11]: `` You ought to tremble before an unreconciled God . ''
Parsing [sent. 2503 len. 8]: `` Like the devils , mother ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2504 len. 8]: `` Like a sinful child of Adam .
Parsing [sent. 2505 len. 25]: Whatever your fancies , Ian , God will not hear you , except you pray to him in the name of his Son . ''
Parsing [sent. 2506 len. 11]: `` Mother , would you take my God from me ?
Parsing [sent. 2507 len. 13]: Would you blot him out of the deeps of the universe ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2508 len. 3]: `` Ian !
Parsing [sent. 2509 len. 4]: are you mad ?
Parsing [sent. 2510 len. 11]: What frightful things you would lay to my charge ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2511 len. 11]: `` Mother , I would gladly -- oh how gladly !
Parsing [sent. 2512 len. 20]: perish for ever , to save God from being the kind of God you would have me believe him .
Parsing [sent. 2513 len. 13]: I love God , and will not think him other than good .
Parsing [sent. 2514 len. 38]: Rather than believe he does not hear every creature that cries to him , whether he knows Jesus Christ or not , I would believe there was no God , and go mourning to my grave . ''
Parsing [sent. 2515 len. 11]: `` That is not the doctrine of the gospel . ''
Parsing [sent. 2516 len. 28]: `` It is , mother : Jesus himself says , ` Every one that hath heard and learned of the Father , cometh unto me . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 2517 len. 13]: `` Why then do you not come to him , Ian ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2518 len. 14]: `` I do come to him ; I come to him every day .
Parsing [sent. 2519 len. 7]: I believe in nobody but him .
Parsing [sent. 2520 len. 15]: He only makes the universe worth being , or any life worth living ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2521 len. 9]: `` Ian , I can NOT understand you !
Parsing [sent. 2522 len. 20]: If you believe like that about him , -- '' `` I do n't believe ABOUT him , mother !
Parsing [sent. 2523 len. 5]: I believe in him .
Parsing [sent. 2524 len. 6]: He is my life . ''
Parsing [sent. 2525 len. 8]: `` We will not dispute about words !
Parsing [sent. 2526 len. 20]: The question is , do you place your faith for salvation in the sufferings of Christ for you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2527 len. 7]: `` I do not , mother .
Parsing [sent. 2528 len. 13]: My faith is in Jesus himself , not in his sufferings . ''
Parsing [sent. 2529 len. 14]: `` Then the anger of God is not turned away from you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2530 len. 23]: `` Mother , I say again -- I love God , and will not believe such things of him as you say .
Parsing [sent. 2531 len. 17]: I love him so that I would rather lose him than believe so of him . ''
Parsing [sent. 2532 len. 13]: `` Then you do not accept the Bible as your guide ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2533 len. 14]: `` I do , mother , for it tells me of Jesus Christ .
Parsing [sent. 2534 len. 13]: There is no such teaching as you say in the Bible . ''
Parsing [sent. 2535 len. 10]: `` How little you know your New Testament ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2536 len. 9]: `` I do n't know my New Testament !
Parsing [sent. 2537 len. 9]: It is the only book I do know !
Parsing [sent. 2538 len. 5]: I read it constantly !
Parsing [sent. 2539 len. 11]: It is the only thing I could not live without !
Parsing [sent. 2540 len. 9]: -- No , I do not mean that !
Parsing [sent. 2541 len. 7]: I COULD do without my Testament !
Parsing [sent. 2542 len. 8]: Christ would BE all the same ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2543 len. 5]: `` Oh , Ian !
Parsing [sent. 2544 len. 2]: Ian !
Parsing [sent. 2545 len. 21]: and yet you will not give Christ the glory of satisfying divine justice by his suffering for your sins ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2546 len. 24]: `` Mother , to say that the justice of God is satisfied with suffering , is a piece of the darkness of hell .
Parsing [sent. 2547 len. 28]: God is willing to suffer , and ready to inflict suffering to save from sin , but no suffering is satisfaction to him or his justice . ''
Parsing [sent. 2548 len. 11]: `` What do you mean by his justice then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2549 len. 13]: `` That he gives you and me and everybody fair play . ''
Parsing [sent. 2550 len. 13]: The homeliness of the phrase offended the moral ear of the mother .
Parsing [sent. 2551 len. 13]: `` How dare you speak lightly of HIM in my hearing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2552 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 2553 len. 16]: `` Because I will speak for God even to the face of my mother ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2554 len. 3]: answered Ian .
Parsing [sent. 2555 len. 16]: `` He is more to me than you , mother -- ten times more . ''
Parsing [sent. 2556 len. 20]: `` You speak against God , Ian , '' she rejoined , calmed by the feeling she had roused .
Parsing [sent. 2557 len. 5]: `` No , mother .
Parsing [sent. 2558 len. 14]: He speaks against God who says he does things that are not good .
Parsing [sent. 2559 len. 12]: It does not make a thing good to call it good .
Parsing [sent. 2560 len. 15]: I speak FOR him when I say lie can not but give fair play .
Parsing [sent. 2561 len. 30]: He knows he put rue where I was sure to sin ; he will not condemn me because I have sinned ; he leaves me to do that myself .
Parsing [sent. 2562 len. 30]: He will condemn me only if I do not turn away from sin , for he has made me able to turn from it , and I do . ''
Parsing [sent. 2563 len. 12]: `` He will forgive sin only for Christ 's sake . ''
Parsing [sent. 2564 len. 17]: `` He forgives it for his own name 's sake , his own love 's sake .
Parsing [sent. 2565 len. 30]: There is no such word as FOR CHRIST 'S SAKE in the New Testament -- except where Paul prays us for Christ 's sake to be reconciled to God .
Parsing [sent. 2566 len. 15]: It is in the English New Testament , but not in the Greek . ''
Parsing [sent. 2567 len. 22]: `` Then you do not believe that the justice of God demands the satisfaction of the sinner 's endless punishment ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2568 len. 5]: `` I do not .
Parsing [sent. 2569 len. 13]: Nothing can satisfy the justice of God but justice in his creature .
Parsing [sent. 2570 len. 20]: The justice of God is the love of what is right , and the doing of what is right .
Parsing [sent. 2571 len. 21]: Eternal misery in the name of justice could satisfy none but a demon whose bad laws had been broken . ''
Parsing [sent. 2572 len. 32]: `` I grant you that no amount of suffering on the part of the wicked could SATISFY justice ; but it is the Holy One who suffers for our sins ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2573 len. 5]: `` Oh , mother !
Parsing [sent. 2574 len. 8]: JUSTICE do wrong for its own satisfaction !
Parsing [sent. 2575 len. 5]: Did Jesus DESERVE punishment ?
Parsing [sent. 2576 len. 13]: If not , then to punish him was to wrong him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2577 len. 27]: `` But he was willing ; he consented ; '' `` He yielded to injustice -- but the injustice was man 's , not God 's .
Parsing [sent. 2578 len. 23]: If Justice , insisted on punishent , it would at least insist on the guilty , not the innocent , being punished !
Parsing [sent. 2579 len. 15]: it would revolt from the idea of the innocent being punished for the guilty !
Parsing [sent. 2580 len. 16]: Mind , I say BEING PUNISHED , not SUFFERING : that is another thing altogether .
Parsing [sent. 2581 len. 26]: It is an eternal satisfaction to love to suffer for the guilty , but not to justice that innocence should be punished for the guilty .
Parsing [sent. 2582 len. 26]: The whole idea of such atonement is the merest subterfuge , a figment of the paltry human intellect to reconcile difficulties of its own invention .
Parsing [sent. 2583 len. 29]: Once , when Alister had done something wrong , my father said , ` He must be punished -- except some one will be punished for him ! '
Parsing [sent. 2584 len. 33]: I offered to take his place , partly that it seemed expected of me , partly that I was moved by vanity , and partly that I foresaw what would follow . ''
Parsing [sent. 2585 len. 7]: `` And what did follow ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2586 len. 25]: asked the mother , to whom the least word out of the past concerning her husband , was like news from the world beyond .
Parsing [sent. 2587 len. 24]: At the same time it seemed almost an offence that one of his sons should know anything about him she did not know .
Parsing [sent. 2588 len. 12]: `` He scarcely touched me , mother , '' answered Ian .
Parsing [sent. 2589 len. 18]: `` The thing taught me something very different from what he had meant to teach by it .
Parsing [sent. 2590 len. 31]: That he failed to carry out his idea of justice helped me afterwards to see that God could not have done it either , for that it was not justice .
Parsing [sent. 2591 len. 29]: Some perception of this must have lain at the root of the heresy that Jesus did not suffer , but a cloud-phantom took his place on the cross .
Parsing [sent. 2592 len. 14]: Wherever people speculate instead of obeying , they fall into endless error . ''
Parsing [sent. 2593 len. 5]: `` You graceless boy !
Parsing [sent. 2594 len. 13]: Do you dare to say your father speculated instead of obeying ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2595 len. 8]: cried the mother , hot with indignation .
Parsing [sent. 2596 len. 5]: `` No , mother .
Parsing [sent. 2597 len. 19]: It was not my father who invented that way of accounting for the death of our Lord . ''
Parsing [sent. 2598 len. 6]: `` He believed it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2599 len. 19]: `` He accepted it , saturated with the tradition of the elders before he could think for himself .
Parsing [sent. 2600 len. 8]: He does not believe it now . ''
Parsing [sent. 2601 len. 10]: `` But why then should Christ have suffered ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2602 len. 17]: `` It is the one fact that explains to me everything , '' said Ian . ''
Parsing [sent. 2603 len. 11]: -- But I am not going to talk about it .
Parsing [sent. 2604 len. 17]: So long as your theory satisfies you , mother , why should I show you mine ?
Parsing [sent. 2605 len. 67]: When it no longer satisfies you , when it troubles you as it has troubled me , and as I pray God it may trouble you , when you feel it stand between you and the best love you could give God , then I will share my very soul with you -- tell you thoughts which seem to sublimate my very being in adoration . ''
Parsing [sent. 2606 len. 24]: `` I do not see what other meaning you can put upon the statement that he was a sacrifice for our sins . ''
Parsing [sent. 2607 len. 21]: `` Had we not sinned he would never have died ; and he died to deliver us from our sins .
Parsing [sent. 2608 len. 25]: He against whom was the sin , became the sacrifice for it ; the Father suffered in the Son , for they are one .
Parsing [sent. 2609 len. 29]: But if I could see no other explanation than yours , I would not , could not accept it -- for God 's sake I would not . ''
Parsing [sent. 2610 len. 20]: `` How can you say you believe in Christ , when you do not believe in the atonement ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2611 len. 8]: `` It is not so , mother .
Parsing [sent. 2612 len. 22]: I do not believe what you mean by the atonement ; what God means by it , I desire to accept .
Parsing [sent. 2613 len. 42]: But we are never told to believe in the atonement ; we are told to believe in Christ -- and , mother , in the name of the great Father who hears me speak , I do believe in him . ''
Parsing [sent. 2614 len. 17]: `` How can you , when you do not believe what God says about him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2615 len. 4]: `` I do .
Parsing [sent. 2616 len. 13]: God does not say those things about him you think he says .
Parsing [sent. 2617 len. 14]: They are mere traditions , not the teaching of those who understood him .
Parsing [sent. 2618 len. 18]: But I might believe all about him quite correctly , and yet not believe in him . ''
Parsing [sent. 2619 len. 12]: `` What do you call believing in him , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2620 len. 15]: `` Obeying him , mother -- to say it as shortly as I can .
Parsing [sent. 2621 len. 26]: I try to obey him in the smallest things he says -- only there are no small things he says -- and so does Alister .
Parsing [sent. 2622 len. 20]: I strive to be what he would have me , nor do I hold anything else worth my care .
Parsing [sent. 2623 len. 35]: Let a man trust in his atonement to absolute assurance , if he does not do the things he tells him -- the very things he said -- he does not believe in him .
Parsing [sent. 2624 len. 30]: He may be a good man , but he has not yet heard enough and learned enough of the Father to be sent to Jesus to learn more . ''
Parsing [sent. 2625 len. 33]: `` Then I do not believe in him , '' said the mother , with a strange , sad gentleness -- for his words awoke an old anxiety never quite at rest .
Parsing [sent. 2626 len. 4]: Ian was silent .
Parsing [sent. 2627 len. 14]: The darkness seemed to deepen around them , and the silence grew keen .
Parsing [sent. 2628 len. 6]: The mother began to tremble .
Parsing [sent. 2629 len. 19]: `` GOD KNOWS , '' said Ian at length , and again the broken silence closed around them .
Parsing [sent. 2630 len. 9]: It was between God and his mother now !
Parsing [sent. 2631 len. 20]: Unwise counsellors will persuade the half crazy doubter in his own faith , to believe that he does believe !
Parsing [sent. 2632 len. 35]: -- how much better to convince him that his faith is a poor thing , that he must rise and go and do the thing that Jesus tells him , and so believe indeed !
Parsing [sent. 2633 len. 29]: When will men understand that it is neither thought nor talk , neither sorrow for sin nor love of holiness that is required of them , but obedience !
Parsing [sent. 2634 len. 8]: To BE and to OBEY are one .
Parsing [sent. 2635 len. 17]: A cold hand grasping her heart , the mother rose , and went from the room .
Parsing [sent. 2636 len. 11]: The gulf seemed now at last utterly , hopelessly impassable !
Parsing [sent. 2637 len. 12]: She had only feared it before ; she knew it now !
Parsing [sent. 2638 len. 37]: She did not see that , while she believed evil things of God , and none the less that she called them good , oneness was impossible between her and any being in God 's creation .
Parsing [sent. 2639 len. 23]: The poor mother thought herself broken-hearted , and lay down too sick to know that she was trembling from head to foot .
Parsing [sent. 2640 len. 61]: Such was the hold , such the authority of traditional human dogma on her soul -- a soul that scorned the notion of priestly interposition between God and his creature -- that , instead of glorifying God that she had given birth to such a man , she wept bitterly because he was on the broad road to eternal condemnation .
Parsing [sent. 2641 len. 27]: But as she lay , now weeping , now still and cold with despair , she found that for some time she had not been thinking .
Parsing [sent. 2642 len. 7]: But she had not been asleep !
Parsing [sent. 2643 len. 10]: Whence then was this quiet that was upon her ?
Parsing [sent. 2644 len. 10]: Something had happened , though she knew of nothing !
Parsing [sent. 2645 len. 12]: There was in her as it were a moonlight of peace !
Parsing [sent. 2646 len. 7]: `` Can it be God ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2647 len. 5]: she said to herself .
Parsing [sent. 2648 len. 37]: No more than Ian could she tell whether it was God or not ; but from that night she had an idea in her soul by which to reach after `` the peace of God . ''
Parsing [sent. 2649 len. 58]: She lifted up her heart in such prayer as she had never prayed before ; and slowly , imperceptibly awoke in her the feeling that , if she was not believing aright , God would not therefore cast her off , but would help her to believe as she ought to believe : was she not willing ?
Parsing [sent. 2650 len. 38]: Therewith she began to feel as if the gulf betwixt her and Ian were not so wide as she had supposed ; and that if it were , she would yet hope in the Son of Man .
Parsing [sent. 2651 len. 34]: Doubtless he was in rebellion against God , seeing he would question his ways , and refuse to believe the word he had spoken , but surely something might be done for him !
Parsing [sent. 2652 len. 28]: The possibility had not yet dawned upon her that there could be anything in the New Testament but those doctrines against which the best in him revolted .
Parsing [sent. 2653 len. 20]: She little suspected the glory of sky and earth and sea eternal that would one day burst upon her !
Parsing [sent. 2654 len. 33]: that she would one day see God not only good but infinitely good -- infinitely better than she had dared to think him , fearing to image him better than he was !
Parsing [sent. 2655 len. 16]: Mortal , she dreaded being more just than God , more pure than her maker !
Parsing [sent. 2656 len. 8]: `` I will go away to-morrow ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2657 len. 5]: said Ian to himself .
Parsing [sent. 2658 len. 9]: `` I am only a pain to her .
Parsing [sent. 2659 len. 10]: She will come to see things better without me !
Parsing [sent. 2660 len. 11]: I can not live in her sight any longer now !
Parsing [sent. 2661 len. 9]: I will go , and come again . ''
Parsing [sent. 2662 len. 7]: His heart broke forth in prayer .
Parsing [sent. 2663 len. 53]: `` O God , let my mother see that thou art indeed true-hearted ; that thou dost not give us life by parings and subterfuges , but abundantly ; that thou dost not make men in order to assert thy dominion over them , but that they may partake of thy life .
Parsing [sent. 2664 len. 46]: O God , have pity when I can not understand , and teach me as thou wouldst the little one whom , if thou wert an earthly father amongst us as thy son was an earthly son , thou wouldst carry about in thy arms .
Parsing [sent. 2665 len. 97]: When pride rises in me , and I feel as if I ought to be free and walk without thy hand ; when it looks as if a man should be great in himself , nor need help from God ; then think thou of me , and I shall know that I can not live or think without the self-willing life ; that thou art because thou art , I am because thou art ; that I am deeper in thee than my life , thou more to my being than that being to itself .
Parsing [sent. 2666 len. 9]: Was not that Satan 's temptation , Father ?
Parsing [sent. 2667 len. 23]: Did he not take self for the root of self in him , when God only is the root of all self ?
Parsing [sent. 2668 len. 7]: And he has not repented yet !
Parsing [sent. 2669 len. 20]: Is it his thought coming up in me , flung from the hollow darkness of his soul into mine ?
Parsing [sent. 2670 len. 10]: Thou knowest , when it comes I am wretched .
Parsing [sent. 2671 len. 5]: I love it not .
Parsing [sent. 2672 len. 10]: I would have thee lord and love over all .
Parsing [sent. 2673 len. 20]: But I can not understand : how comes it to look sometimes as if indeinpendence must be the greater ?
Parsing [sent. 2674 len. 10]: A lie can not be greater than the truth !
Parsing [sent. 2675 len. 9]: I do not understand , but thou dost .
Parsing [sent. 2676 len. 25]: I can not see my foundations ; I can not dig up the roots of my being : that would be to understand creation !
Parsing [sent. 2677 len. 15]: Will the Adversary ever come to see that thou only art grand and beautiful ?
Parsing [sent. 2678 len. 14]: How came he to think to be greater by setting up for himself ?
Parsing [sent. 2679 len. 10]: How was it that it looked so to him ?
Parsing [sent. 2680 len. 15]: How is it that , not being true , it should ever look so ?
Parsing [sent. 2681 len. 17]: There must be an independence that thou lovest , of which this temptation is the shadow !
Parsing [sent. 2682 len. 8]: That must be how ` Satan fell !
Parsing [sent. 2683 len. 10]: -- for the sake of not being a slave !
Parsing [sent. 2684 len. 9]: -- that he might be a free being !
Parsing [sent. 2685 len. 11]: Ah , Lord , I see how it all comes !
Parsing [sent. 2686 len. 27]: It is because we are not near enough to thee to partake of thy liberty that we want a liberty of our own different from thine !
Parsing [sent. 2687 len. 27]: We do not see that we are one with thee , that thy glory is our glory , that we can have none but in thee !
Parsing [sent. 2688 len. 24]: that we are of thy family , thy home , thy heart , and what is great for thee is great for us !
Parsing [sent. 2689 len. 15]: that man 's meanness is to want to be great out of his Father !
Parsing [sent. 2690 len. 23]: Without thy eternity in us we are so small that we think ourselves great , and are thus miserably abject and contemptible .
Parsing [sent. 2691 len. 5]: Thou only art true !
Parsing [sent. 2692 len. 5]: thou only art noble !
Parsing [sent. 2693 len. 7]: thou wantest no glory for selfishness !
Parsing [sent. 2694 len. 13]: thou doest , thou art , what thou requirest of thy children !
Parsing [sent. 2695 len. 44]: I know it , for I see it in Jesus , who casts the contempt of obedience upon the baseness of pride , who cares only for thee and for us , never thinking of himself save as a gift to give us !
Parsing [sent. 2696 len. 6]: O lovely , perfect Christ !
Parsing [sent. 2697 len. 8]: with my very life I worship thee !
Parsing [sent. 2698 len. 6]: Oh , pray , Christ !
Parsing [sent. 2699 len. 26]: make me and my brother strong to be the very thing thou wouldst have us , as thy brothers , the children of thy Father .
Parsing [sent. 2700 len. 16]: Thou art our perfect brother -- perfect in love , in courage , in tenderness !
Parsing [sent. 2701 len. 4]: Amen , Lord !
Parsing [sent. 2702 len. 2]: Good-night !
Parsing [sent. 2703 len. 5]: I am thine . ''
Parsing [sent. 2704 len. 28]: He was silent for a few moments , then resumed : `` Lord , thou knowest whither my thoughts turn the moment I cease praying to thee .
Parsing [sent. 2705 len. 13]: I dared not think of her , but that I know thee .
Parsing [sent. 2706 len. 13]: But for thee , my heart would be as water within me !
Parsing [sent. 2707 len. 12]: Oh , take care of her , come near to her !
Parsing [sent. 2708 len. 16]: Thou didst send her where she could not learn fast -- but she did learn .
Parsing [sent. 2709 len. 13]: And now , God , I do not know where she is !
Parsing [sent. 2710 len. 28]: Thou only of all in this world knowest , for to thee she lives though gone from my sight and knowledge -- in the dark to me .
Parsing [sent. 2711 len. 19]: Pray , Father , let her know that thou art near her , and that I love her .
Parsing [sent. 2712 len. 20]: Thou hast made me love her by taking her from me : thou wilt give her to me again !
Parsing [sent. 2713 len. 27]: In this hope I will live all my days , until thou takest me also ; for to hope mightily is to believe well in thee .
Parsing [sent. 2714 len. 7]: I will hope in thee infinitely .
Parsing [sent. 2715 len. 5]: Amen , Father ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2716 len. 3]: CHAPTER XVI .
Parsing [sent. 2717 len. 4]: THE CLAN CHRISTMAS .
Parsing [sent. 2718 len. 21]: By slow degrees , with infinite subdivisions and apparent reversals of change , the autumn had passed into winter indeed .
Parsing [sent. 2719 len. 64]: Cloud above , mire below , mist and rain all between , made up many days ; only , like the dreariest life , they were broken through and parted , lest they should seem the universe itself , by such heavenly manifestations , such gleams and glimpses of better , as come into all lives , all winters , all evil weathers .
Parsing [sent. 2720 len. 30]: What is loosed on earth is loosed first in heaven : we have often shared of heaven , when we thought it but a softening of earth 's hardness .
Parsing [sent. 2721 len. 15]: Every relief is a promise , a pledge as well as a passing meal .
Parsing [sent. 2722 len. 14]: The frost at length had brought with it brightness and persuasion and rousing .
Parsing [sent. 2723 len. 28]: In the fields it was swelling and breaking the clods ; and for the heart of man , it did something to break up that clod too .
Parsing [sent. 2724 len. 11]: A sense of friendly pleasure filled all the human creatures .
Parsing [sent. 2725 len. 15]: The children ran about like wild things ; the air seemed to intoxicate them .
Parsing [sent. 2726 len. 27]: The mother went out walking with the girls , and they talked of their father and Christian and Mr. Sercombe , who were all coming together .
Parsing [sent. 2727 len. 11]: For some time they saw nothing of their next neighbours .
Parsing [sent. 2728 len. 38]: They had made some attempts at acquaintance with the people of the glen , but unhappily were nowise courteous enough for their ideas of good breeding , and offended both their pride and their sense of propriety .
Parsing [sent. 2729 len. 39]: The manners and address of these northern peasants were blameless -- nearly perfect indeed , like those of the Irish , and in their own houses beyond criticism ; those of the ladies conventional where not rudely condescending .
Parsing [sent. 2730 len. 37]: If Mistress Conal was an exception to the rest of the clan , even she would be more civil to a stranger than to her chief whom she loved -- until the stranger gave her offence .
Parsing [sent. 2731 len. 28]: And if then she passed to imprecation , she would not curse like an ordinary woman , but like a poetess , gaining rather than losing dignity .
Parsing [sent. 2732 len. 23]: She would rise to the evil occasion , no hag , but a largely-offended sibyl , whom nothing thereafter should ever appease .
Parsing [sent. 2733 len. 10]: To forgive was a virtue unknown to Mistress Conal .
Parsing [sent. 2734 len. 17]: Its more than ordinary difficulty in forgiving is indeed a special fault of the Celtic character .
Parsing [sent. 2735 len. 13]: -- This must not however be confounded with a desire for revenge .
Parsing [sent. 2736 len. 11]: The latter is by no means a specially Celtic characteristic .
Parsing [sent. 2737 len. 8]: Resentment and vengeance are far from inseparable .
Parsing [sent. 2738 len. 35]: The heart that surpasses in courtesy , except indeed that courtesy , be rooted in love divine , must , when treated with discourtesy , experience the worse revulsion , feel the bitterer indignation .
Parsing [sent. 2739 len. 43]: But many a Celt would forgive , and forgive thoroughly and heartily , with his enemy in his power , who , so long as he remained beyond his reach , could not even imagine circumstances in which they might be reconciled .
Parsing [sent. 2740 len. 19]: To a Celt the summit of wrong is a slight , but apology is correspondingly potent with him .
Parsing [sent. 2741 len. 15]: Mistress Conal , however , had not the excuse of a specially courteous nature .
Parsing [sent. 2742 len. 57]: Christina and Mercy , calling upon her one morning , were not ungraciously received , but had the misfortune to remark , trusting to her supposed ignorance of English , upon the dirtiness of her floor , they themselves having imported not a little of the moisture that had turned its surface into a muddy paste .
Parsing [sent. 2743 len. 36]: She said nothing , but , to the general grudge she bore the possessors of property once belonging to her clan , she now added a personal one ; the offence lay cherished and smouldering .
Parsing [sent. 2744 len. 34]: Had the chief offended her , she would have found a score of ways to prove to herself that he meant nothing ; but she desired no mitigation of the trespass of strangers .
Parsing [sent. 2745 len. 18]: The people at the New House did not get on very well with any of the clan .
Parsing [sent. 2746 len. 33]: In the first place , they were regarded not merely as interlopers , but almost as thieves of the property -- though in truth it had passed to them through other hands .
Parsing [sent. 2747 len. 42]: In the second place , a rumour had got about that they did not behave with sufficient respect to the chief 's family , in the point of whose honour the clan was the more exacting because of their common poverty .
Parsing [sent. 2748 len. 19]: Hence the inhabitants of the glen , though they were of course polite , showed but little friendliness .
Parsing [sent. 2749 len. 56]: But the main obstacle to their reception was in themselves : the human was not much developed in them ; they understood nothing of their own beings ; they had never had any difficulty with themselves : -- how could they understand others , especially in circumstances and with histories so different from their own !
Parsing [sent. 2750 len. 31]: They had not a notion how poor people feel , still less poor people poorer than before -- or how they regard the rich who have what they have lost .
Parsing [sent. 2751 len. 51]: They did not understand any huftian feeling -- not even the silliness they called LOVE -- a godless , mindless affair , fit only for the doll-histories invented by children : they had a feeling , or a feeling had them , till another feeling came and took its place .
Parsing [sent. 2752 len. 42]: When a feeling was there , they felt as if it would never go ; when it was gone , they felt as if it had never been ; when it returned , they felt as if it had never gone .
Parsing [sent. 2753 len. 37]: They seldom came so near anything as to think about it , never put a question to themselves as to how a thing affected them , or concerning the phenomena of its passage through their consciousness !
Parsing [sent. 2754 len. 49]: There is a child-eternity of soul that needs to ask nothing , because it understands everything : the ways of the spirit are open to it ; but where a soul does not understand , and has to learn , how is it to do so without thinking ?
Parsing [sent. 2755 len. 26]: They knew nothing of labour , nothing of danger , nothing of hunger , nothing of cold , nothing of sickness , nothing of loneliness .
Parsing [sent. 2756 len. 19]: The realities of life , in their lowest forms as in their highest , were far from them .
Parsing [sent. 2757 len. 73]: If they had nearly gone through life instead of having but entered upon it , they would have had some ground for thinking themselves unfairly dealt with ; for to be made , and then left to be worthless , unfit even for damnation , might be suspected for hard lines ; but there is One who takes a perfect interest in his lowliest creature , and will not so spare it .
Parsing [sent. 2758 len. 39]: They were girls notwithstanding who could make themselves agreeable , and passed for clever -- Christina because she could give a sharp answer , and sing a drawingroom-song , Mercy because as yet she mostly held her tongue .
Parsing [sent. 2759 len. 31]: That there was at the same time in each of them the possibility of being developed into something of inestimable value , is merely to say that they were human .
Parsing [sent. 2760 len. 9]: The days passed , and Christmas drew near .
Parsing [sent. 2761 len. 4]: The gentlemen arrived .
Parsing [sent. 2762 len. 9]: There was family delight and a bustling reception .
Parsing [sent. 2763 len. 72]: It is amazing -- it shows indeed how deep and divine , how much beyond the individual self are the family affections -- that such gladness breaks forth in the meeting of persons who , within an hour or so of the joyous welcome , self getting the better of the divine , will begin to feel bored , and will each lay the blame of the disappointment on the other .
Parsing [sent. 2764 len. 38]: Coats were pulled off ; mufflers were unwound ; pretty hands were helping ; strong hands were lifting and carrying ; every room was bright with a great fire ; tea was refused , and dinner welcomed .
Parsing [sent. 2765 len. 45]: After dinner came the unpacking of great boxes ; and in the midst of the resultant pleasure , the proposal came to be made -- none but Christina knew how -- that the inhabitants of the cottage should be invited to dinner on Christmas-eve .
Parsing [sent. 2766 len. 16]: It was carried at once , and the next afternoon a formal invitation was sent .
Parsing [sent. 2767 len. 10]: At the cottage it caused conference , no discussion .
Parsing [sent. 2768 len. 49]: The lady of the New House had not called with her girls , it was true ; but then neither had the lady of the castle -- for that was the clanspeople 's name for the whole ridge on which the cottage stood -- called on the new-comers !
Parsing [sent. 2769 len. 9]: If there was offence , it was mutual !
Parsing [sent. 2770 len. 53]: The unceremonious invitation MIGHT indicate that it was not thought necessary to treat them as persons who knew the ways of society ; on the other hand , if it meant that they were ready to throw aside formalities and behave heartily , it would be wrong not to meet them half-way !
Parsing [sent. 2771 len. 32]: They resolved therefore to make a counter-proposal ; and if the invitation came of neighbourliness , and not of imagined patronage , they would certainly meet it in a friendly spirit !
Parsing [sent. 2772 len. 104]: Answer was returned , sealed with no mere crest but with a coat of arms , to the effect that it had been the custom since time forgotten for the chief to welcome his people and friends without distinction on Christmas-eve , and the custom could not be broken ; but if the ladies and gentlemen of the New House would favour them with their com - company on the occasion , to dine and dance , the chief and his family would gratefully accept any later offer of hospitality Mr. and Mrs. Peregrine Palmer might do them , the honour to send .
Parsing [sent. 2773 len. 31]: This reply gave occasion to a good deal of talk at the New House , not entirely of a sort which the friends of the chief would have enjoyed hearing .
Parsing [sent. 2774 len. 33]: Frequent were the bursts of laughter from the men at the assumption of the title of CHIEF by a man with no more land than he could just manage to live upon .
Parsing [sent. 2775 len. 70]: The village they said , and said truly , in which the greater number of HIS PEOPLE lived , was not his at all -- not a foot of the ground on which it stood , not a stone or sod of which it was built -- but belonged to a certain Canadian , who was about to turn all his territory around and adjacent into a deer forest !
Parsing [sent. 2776 len. 54]: They could not see that , if there had ever been anything genuine in the patriarchal relation , the mere loss of the clan-property could no more cause the chieftainship to cease , than could the loss of the silver-hilted Andrew Ferrara , handed down from father to son for so many generations .
Parsing [sent. 2777 len. 39]: There are dull people , and just as many clever people , who look upon customs of society as on laws of nature , and judge the worth of others by their knowledge or ignorance of the same .
Parsing [sent. 2778 len. 22]: So doing they disable themselves from understanding the essential , which is , like love , the fulfilling of the law .
Parsing [sent. 2779 len. 39]: A certain Englishman gave great offence in an Arab tent by striding across the food placed for the company on the ground : would any Celt , Irish or Welsh , have been guilty of such a blunder ?
Parsing [sent. 2780 len. 12]: But there was not any overt offence on the present occasion .
Parsing [sent. 2781 len. 73]: They called it indeed a cool proposal that THEY should put off their Christmas party for that of a ploughman in shabby kilt and hob-nailed shoes ; but on their amused indignation supervened the thought that they were in a wild part of the country , where it would be absurd to expect the SAVOIR VIVRE of the south , and it would be amusing to see the customs of the land .
Parsing [sent. 2782 len. 30]: By suggestion and seeming response , the clever Christina , unsuspected even of Mercy , was the motive power to bring about the acceptance of the chief 's invitation .
Parsing [sent. 2783 len. 42]: A friendly answer was returned : they would not go to dinner , they said , as it was their custom also to dine at home on Christmas-eve ; but they would dine early , and spend the evening with them .
Parsing [sent. 2784 len. 17]: To the laird the presence of the lowland girls promised a great addition to the merry-making .
Parsing [sent. 2785 len. 43]: During the last thirty years , all the gentlemen-farmers of the clan , and most of the humbler tacksmen as well , had vanished , and there was a wide intellectual space between all those left and the family of the chief .
Parsing [sent. 2786 len. 27]: Often when Ian was away , would Alister , notwithstanding his love to his people and their entire response , have felt lonely but for labour .
Parsing [sent. 2787 len. 105]: There being in the cottage no room equal to the reception of a large company , and the laird receiving all the members of the clan -- `` poor , '' I was going to say , `` and rich , '' but there were no rich -- as well as any neighbour or traveller who chose to appear , the father of the present chief had had good regard to the necessities of entertainment in the construction of a new barn : companionship , large feasting , and dancing , had been even more considered than the storing and threshing of his corn .
Parsing [sent. 2788 len. 40]: There are in these days many who will mock ; but for my part I am proud of a race whose social relations are the last upon which they will retrench , whose latest yielded pleasure is their hospitality .
Parsing [sent. 2789 len. 48]: It is a common feeling that only the WELL-TO-DO have a right to be hospitable : the ideal flower of hospitality is almost unknown to the rich ; it can hardly be grown save in the gardens of the poor ; it is one of their beatitudes .
Parsing [sent. 2790 len. 19]: Means in Glenruadh had been shrinking for many years , but the heart of the chief never shrank .
Parsing [sent. 2791 len. 24]: His dwelling dwindled from a castle to a house , from a house to a cottage ; but the hospitality did not dwindle .
Parsing [sent. 2792 len. 52]: As the money vanished , the show diminished ; the place of entertainment from a hall became a kitchen , from a kitchen changed to a barn ; but the heart of the chief was the same ; the entertainment was but little altered , the hospitality not in the least .
Parsing [sent. 2793 len. 20]: When things grow hard , the first saving is generally off others ; the Macruadh 's was off himself .
Parsing [sent. 2794 len. 15]: The land was not his , save as steward of the grace of God !
Parsing [sent. 2795 len. 29]: Let it not be supposed he ran in debt : with his mother at the head , or rather the heart of affairs , that could not be .
Parsing [sent. 2796 len. 17]: She was not one to regard as hospitality a readiness to share what you have not !
Parsing [sent. 2797 len. 43]: Little did good Doctor Johnson suspect the shifts to which some of the highland families he visited were driven -- not to feed , but to house him : and housing in certain conditions of society is the large half of hospitality .
Parsing [sent. 2798 len. 38]: Where he did not find his quarters comfortable , he did not know what crowding had to be devised , what inconveniences endured by the family , that he might have what ease and freedom were possible .
Parsing [sent. 2799 len. 22]: Be it in stone hall or thatched cottage , the chief must entertain the stranger as well as befriend his own !
Parsing [sent. 2800 len. 21]: This was the fulfilling of his office -- none the less that it had descended upon him in evil times .
Parsing [sent. 2801 len. 118]: That seldom if ever had a chief been Christian enough or strong enough to fill to the full the relation of father of his people , was nothing against the ideal fact in the existent relation ; it was rather for it : now that the chieftainship had come to a man with a large notion of what it required of him , he was the more , not the less ready to aim at the mark of the idea ; he was not the more easily to be turned aside from a true attempt to live up to his calling , that many had yielded and were swept along bound slaves in the triumph of Mammon !
Parsing [sent. 2802 len. 19]: He looked on his calling as entirely enough to fill full the life that would fulfil the calling .
Parsing [sent. 2803 len. 26]: It was ambition enough for him to be the head of his family , with the highest of earthly relations to realize toward its members .
Parsing [sent. 2804 len. 20]: As to the vulgar notion of a man 's obligation to himself , he had learned to despise it .
Parsing [sent. 2805 len. 4]: `` Eubbish ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2806 len. 4]: Ian would say .
Parsing [sent. 2807 len. 7]: `` I owe my self nothing .
Parsing [sent. 2808 len. 14]: What has my self ever done for me , but lead me wrong ?
Parsing [sent. 2809 len. 27]: What but it has come between me and my duty -- between me and my very Father in heaven -- between me and my fellow man !
Parsing [sent. 2810 len. 33]: The fools of greed would persuade that a man has no right to waste himself in the low content of making and sharing a humble living ; he ought to make money !
Parsing [sent. 2811 len. 9]: make a figure in the world , forsooth !
Parsing [sent. 2812 len. 3]: be somebody !
Parsing [sent. 2813 len. 7]: ` Dwell among the people ! '
Parsing [sent. 2814 len. 7]: such would say : ` Bah !
Parsing [sent. 2815 len. 6]: Let them look after themselves !
Parsing [sent. 2816 len. 22]: If they can not pay their rents , others will ; what is it to you if the rents are paid ?
Parsing [sent. 2817 len. 21]: Send them about their business ; turn the land into a deer-forest or a sheep-farm , and clear them out !
Parsing [sent. 2818 len. 5]: They have no rights !
Parsing [sent. 2819 len. 19]: A man is bound to the children of his body begotten ; the people are nothing to him !
Parsing [sent. 2820 len. 18]: A man is not his brother 's keeper -- except when he has got him in prison !
Parsing [sent. 2821 len. 13]: And so on , in the name of the great devil ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2822 len. 81]: Whether there was enough in Alister to have met and overcome the spirit of the world , had he been brought up at Oxford or Cambridge , I have not to determine ; there was that in him at least which would have come to , repent bitterly had he yielded ; but brought up as he was , he was not only able to entertain the exalted idea presented to him , but to receive and make it his .
Parsing [sent. 2823 len. 40]: With joy he recognized the higher dignity of the shepherd of a few poor , lean , wool-torn human sheep , than of the man who stands for himself , however `` spacious in the possession of dirt . ''
Parsing [sent. 2824 len. 38]: He who holds dead land a possession , and living souls none of his , needs wake no curse , for he is in the very pit of creation , a live outrage on the human family .
Parsing [sent. 2825 len. 41]: If Alister Macruadh was not in the highest grade of Christianity , he was on his way thither , for he was doing the work that was given him to do , which is the first condition of all advancement .
Parsing [sent. 2826 len. 28]: He had much to learn yet , but he was one who , from every point his feet touched , was on the start to go further .
Parsing [sent. 2827 len. 11]: The day of the holy eve rose clear and bright .
Parsing [sent. 2828 len. 12]: Snow was on the hills , and frost in the valley .
Parsing [sent. 2829 len. 43]: There had been a time when at this season great games were played between neighbour districts or clans , but here there were no games now , because there were so few men ; the more active part fell to the women .
Parsing [sent. 2830 len. 51]: Mistress Macruadh was busy all day with her helpers , preparing a dinner of mutton , and beef , and fowls , and red-deer ham ; and the men soon gave the barn something of the aspect of the old patriarchal hall for which it was no very poor substitute .
Parsing [sent. 2831 len. 41]: A long table , covered with the finest linen , was laid for all comers ; and when the guests took their places , they needed no arranging ; all knew their standing , and seated themselves according to knowledge .
Parsing [sent. 2832 len. 31]: Two or three small farmers took modestly the upper places once occupied by immediate relatives of the chief , for of the old gentry of the clan there were none .
Parsing [sent. 2833 len. 13]: But all were happy , for their chief was with them still .
Parsing [sent. 2834 len. 14]: Their reverence was none the less that they were at home with him .
Parsing [sent. 2835 len. 17]: They knew his worth , and the roughest among them would mind what the Macruadh said .
Parsing [sent. 2836 len. 82]: They knew that he feared nothing ; that he was strong as the red stag after which the clan was named ; that , with genuine respect for every man , he would at the least insolence knock the fellow down ; that he was the best shot , the best sailor , the best ploughman in the clan : I would have said THE BEST SWORDSMAN , but that , except Ian , there was not another left to it .
Parsing [sent. 2837 len. 23]: Not many of them , however , understood how much he believed that he had to give an account of his people .
Parsing [sent. 2838 len. 12]: He was far from considering such responsibility the clergyman 's only .
Parsing [sent. 2839 len. 34]: Again and again had he expostulated with some , to save them from the slow gaping hell of drink , and in one case , he had reason to hope , with success .
Parsing [sent. 2840 len. 34]: As they sat at dinner , it seemed to the young fellow who , with his help , had so far been victorious , that the chief scarcely took his eyes off him .
Parsing [sent. 2841 len. 51]: One might think there was small danger where the hostess allowed nothing beyond water and milk but small ale ; the chief , however , was in dread lest he should taste even that , and caught one moment the longing look he threw at the jug as it passed .
Parsing [sent. 2842 len. 34]: He rose and went down the table , speaking to this one and that , but stopped behind the lad , and putting his arm round his shoulders , whispered in his ear .
Parsing [sent. 2843 len. 22]: The youth looked up in his face with a solemn smile : had not the chief embraced him before them all !
Parsing [sent. 2844 len. 13]: He was only a shepherd-lad , but his chief cared for him !
Parsing [sent. 2845 len. 48]: In the afternoon the extemporized tables were cleared away , candles were fixed in rough sconces along the walls , not without precaution against fire , and the floor was rubbed clean -- for the barn was floored throughout with pine , in parts polished with use .
Parsing [sent. 2846 len. 34]: The walls were already covered with the plaids of the men and women , each kept in place by a stone or two on the top of the wall where the rafters rested .
Parsing [sent. 2847 len. 22]: In one end was a great heap of yellow oat-straw , which , partly levelled , made a most delightful divan .
Parsing [sent. 2848 len. 40]: What with the straw , the plaids , the dresses , the shining of silver ornaments , and the flash of here and there a cairngorm or an amethyst , there was not a little colour in the barn .
Parsing [sent. 2849 len. 21]: Some of the guests were poorly but all were decently attired , and the shabbiest behaved as ladies and gentlemen .
Parsing [sent. 2850 len. 36]: The party from the New House walked through the still , star-watched air , with the motionless mountains looking down on them , and a silence around , which they never suspected as a presence .
Parsing [sent. 2851 len. 14]: The little girls were of the company , and there was much merriment .
Parsing [sent. 2852 len. 22]: Foolish compliments were not wanting , offered chiefly on the part of Mr. Sercombe , and accepted on that of Christina .
Parsing [sent. 2853 len. 53]: The ladies , under their furs and hoods , were in their best , with all the jewels they could wear at once , for they had heard that highlanders have a passion for colour , and that poor people are always best pleased when you go to them in your finery .
Parsing [sent. 2854 len. 10]: The souls of these Sasunnachs were full of THINGS .
Parsing [sent. 2855 len. 51]: They made a fine show as they emerged from the darkness of their wraps into the light of the numerous candles ; nor did the approach of the widowed chieftainess to receive them , on the arm of Alister , with Ian on her other side , fail in dignity .
Parsing [sent. 2856 len. 104]: The mother was dressed in a rich , matronly black silk ; the chief was in the full dress of his clan -- the old-fashioned coat of the French court , with its silver buttons and ruffles of fine lace , the kilt of Macruadh tartan in which red predominated , the silver-mounted sporan -- of the skin and adorned with the head of an otter caught with , the bare hands of one of his people , and a silver-mounted dirk of length unusual , famed for the beauty of both hilt and blade ; Ian was similarly though less showily clad .
Parsing [sent. 2857 len. 28]: When she saw the stately dame advancing between her sons , one at least of her visitors felt a doubt whether their condescension would be fully appreciated .
Parsing [sent. 2858 len. 43]: As soon as their reception was over , the piper -- to the discomfort of Mr. Sercombe 's English ears -- began his invitation to the dance , and in a few moments the floor was , in a tumult of reels .
Parsing [sent. 2859 len. 30]: The girls , unacquainted with their own country 's dances , preferred looking on , and after watching reel and strathspey for some time , altogether declined attempting either .
Parsing [sent. 2860 len. 72]: But by and by it was the turn of the clanspeople to look on while the lady of the house and her sons danced a quadrille or two with their visitors ; after which the chief and his brother pairing with the two elder girls , the ladies were astonished to find them the best they had ever waltzed with , although they did not dance quite in the London way .
Parsing [sent. 2861 len. 38]: Ian 's dancing , Christina said , was French ; Mercy said all she knew was that the chief took the work and left her only the motion : she felt as in a dream of flying .
Parsing [sent. 2862 len. 23]: Before the evening was over , the young men had so far gained on Christina that Mr. Sercombe looked a little commonplace .
Parsing [sent. 2863 len. 3]: CHAPTER XVII .
Parsing [sent. 2864 len. 5]: BETWEEN DANCING AND SUPPER .
Parsing [sent. 2865 len. 16]: The dancing began about six o'clock , and at ten it was time for supper .
Parsing [sent. 2866 len. 33]: It was readjr , but there was no room for it except the barn ; the dancing therefore had to cease for a while , that the table might again be covered .
Parsing [sent. 2867 len. 22]: The ladies put on their furs and furry boots and gloves , and went out into the night with the rest .
Parsing [sent. 2868 len. 43]: The laird and Christina started together , but , far from keeping at her side , Alister went and came , now talking to this couple , now to that , and adding to the general pleasure with every word he spoke .
Parsing [sent. 2869 len. 20]: Ian and Mercy walked together , and as often as the chief left her side , Christina joined them .
Parsing [sent. 2870 len. 40]: Mrs. Palmer stayed with their hostess ; her husband took the younger children by the hand ; Mr. Sercombe and Christian sauntered along in the company , talking now to one , now to another of the village girls .
Parsing [sent. 2871 len. 86]: All through the evening Christina and Mercy noted how instantly the word of the chief was followed in the smallest matter , and the fact made its impression on them ; for undeveloped natures in the presence of a force , revere it as POWER -- understanding by POWER , not the strength to create , to harmonize , to redeem , to discover the true , to suffer with patience ; but the faculty of having things one 's own vulgar , self-adoring way .
Parsing [sent. 2872 len. 31]: Ian had not proposed to Mercy that they should walk together ; but when the issuing crowd had broken into twos and threes , they found themselves side by side .
Parsing [sent. 2873 len. 14]: The company took its way along the ridge , and the road eastward .
Parsing [sent. 2874 len. 35]: The night was clear , and like a great sapphire frosted with topazes -- reminding Ian that , solid as is the world under our feet , it hangs in the will of God .
Parsing [sent. 2875 len. 10]: Mercy and he walked for some time in silence .
Parsing [sent. 2876 len. 37]: It was a sudden change from the low barn , the dull candles , and the excitement of the dance , to the awful space , the clear pure far-off lights , and the great stillness .
Parsing [sent. 2877 len. 7]: Both felt it , though differently .
Parsing [sent. 2878 len. 11]: There was in both of them the quest after peace .
Parsing [sent. 2879 len. 23]: It is not the banished demon only that wanders seeking rest , but souls upon souls , and in ever growing numbers .
Parsing [sent. 2880 len. 8]: The world and Hades swarm with them .
Parsing [sent. 2881 len. 22]: They long after a repose that is not mere cessation of labour : there is a positive , an active rest .
Parsing [sent. 2882 len. 18]: Mercy was only beginning to seek it , and that without knowing what it was she needed .
Parsing [sent. 2883 len. 16]: Ian sought it in silence with God ; she in crepitant intercourse with her kind .
Parsing [sent. 2884 len. 76]: Naturally ready to fall into gloom , but healthy enough to avoid it , she would rush at anything to do -- not to keep herself from thinking , for she had hardly begun to think , but to escape that heavy sense of non-existence , that weary and restless want which is the only form life can take to the yet unliving , those who have not yet awakened and arisen from the dead .
Parsing [sent. 2885 len. 81]: She was a human chicken that had begun to be aware of herself , but had not yet attacked the shell that enclosed her : because it was transparent , and she could see life about her , she did not know that she was in a shell , or that , if she did not put forth the might of her own life , she was sealing herself up , a life in death , in her antenatal coffin .
Parsing [sent. 2886 len. 32]: Many who think themselves free have never yet even seen the shell that imprisons them -- know nothing of the liberty wherewith the Lord of our life would set them free .
Parsing [sent. 2887 len. 15]: Men fight many a phantom when they ought to be chipping at their shells .
Parsing [sent. 2888 len. 7]: `` Thou art the dreamer ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2889 len. 9]: they cry to him who would wake them .
Parsing [sent. 2890 len. 13]: `` See how diligent we are to get on in the world !
Parsing [sent. 2891 len. 13]: We labour as if we should never go out of it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2892 len. 24]: What they call the world is but their shell , which is all the time killing the infant Christ that houses with them .
Parsing [sent. 2893 len. 13]: Ian looked up to the sky , and breathed a deep breath .
Parsing [sent. 2894 len. 14]: Mercy looked up in his face , and saw his strangely beautiful smile .
Parsing [sent. 2895 len. 11]: `` What are you thinking of , Captain Macruadh ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2896 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 2897 len. 42]: `` I was thinking , '' he answered , `` that perhaps up THERE '' -- he waved his arm wide over his head -- `` might he something like room ; hut I doubt it , I doubt it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2898 len. 6]: Naturally , Mercy was puzzled .
Parsing [sent. 2899 len. 20]: The speech sounded quite mad , and yet he could not be mad , he had danced so well !
Parsing [sent. 2900 len. 10]: She took comfort that her father was close behind .
Parsing [sent. 2901 len. 22]: `` Did you never feel , '' he resumed , `` as if you could not anyhow get room enough ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2902 len. 11]: `` No , '' answered Mercy , `` never . ''
Parsing [sent. 2903 len. 16]: Ian fell a thinking how to wake in her a feeling of what he meant .
Parsing [sent. 2904 len. 32]: He had perceived that one of the first elements in human education is the sense of space -- of which sense , probably , the star-dwelt heaven is the first awakener .
Parsing [sent. 2905 len. 76]: He believed that without the heavens we could not have learned the largeness in things below them , could not , for instance , have felt the mystery of the high-ascending gothic roof -- for without the greater we can not interpret the less ; and he thought that to have the sense of largeness developed might be to come a little nearer to the truth of things , to the recognition of spiritual relations .
Parsing [sent. 2906 len. 10]: `` Did you ever see anything very big ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2907 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 2908 len. 12]: `` I suppose London is as big as most things ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2909 len. 7]: she answered , after a moment .
Parsing [sent. 2910 len. 8]: `` Did you ever see London ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2911 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 2912 len. 10]: `` We generally live there half the year . ''
Parsing [sent. 2913 len. 31]: `` Pardon me ; I did not ask if you had ever been to London , '' said Ian ; `` I asked if you had ever seen London . ''
Parsing [sent. 2914 len. 10]: `` I know the west end pretty well . ''
Parsing [sent. 2915 len. 11]: `` Did it ever strike you as very large ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2916 len. 16]: `` Perhaps not ; but the west end is only a part of London . ''
Parsing [sent. 2917 len. 15]: `` Did you ever see London from the top of St. Paul 's ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2918 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 2919 len. 14]: `` Did you ever see it from the top of Hampstead heath ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2920 len. 18]: `` I have been there several times , but I do n't remember seeing London from it .
Parsing [sent. 2921 len. 11]: We do n't go to London for the sights . ''
Parsing [sent. 2922 len. 9]: `` Then you have not seen London ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2923 len. 4]: Mercy was annoyed .
Parsing [sent. 2924 len. 34]: Ian did not notice that she was , else perhaps he would not have gone on -- which would have been a pity , for a little annoyance would do her no harm .
Parsing [sent. 2925 len. 24]: At the same time the mood was not favourable to receiving any impression from the region of the things that are not seen .
Parsing [sent. 2926 len. 4]: A pause followed .
Parsing [sent. 2927 len. 33]: `` It is so delightful , '' said Ian at length , `` to come out of the motion and the heat and the narrowness into the still , cold greatness ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2928 len. 15]: `` You seemed to be enjoying yourself pretty well notwithstanding , Captain Macruadh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2929 len. 8]: `` What made you think so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2930 len. 10]: he asked , turning to her with a smile .
Parsing [sent. 2931 len. 39]: `` You were so merry -- not with me -- you think me only a stupid lowland girl ; but the other young persons you danced with , laughed very much at things you said to them . ''
Parsing [sent. 2932 len. 10]: `` You are right ; I did enjoy myself .
Parsing [sent. 2933 len. 21]: As often as one comes near a simple human heart , one 's own heart finds a little room . ''
Parsing [sent. 2934 len. 20]: Ere she knew , Mercy had said -- `` And you did n't find any room with me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2935 len. 22]: With the sound of her words her face grew hot , as with a furnace-blast , even in the frosty night-air .
Parsing [sent. 2936 len. 13]: She would have covered what she had said , but only stammered .
Parsing [sent. 2937 len. 23]: Ian turned , and looking at her , said with a gentle gravity -- `` You must not be offended with me !
Parsing [sent. 2938 len. 6]: I must answer you truly .
Parsing [sent. 2939 len. 22]: -- You do not give me room : have you not just told me you never longed for any yourself ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2940 len. 8]: `` One ought to be independent ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2941 len. 7]: said Mercy , a little nettled .
Parsing [sent. 2942 len. 7]: `` Are you sure of that ?
Parsing [sent. 2943 len. 11]: What is called independence may really be want of sympathy .
Parsing [sent. 2944 len. 12]: That would indicate a kind of loneliness anything but good . ''
Parsing [sent. 2945 len. 12]: `` I wish you would find a less disagreeable companion then !
Parsing [sent. 2946 len. 12]: -- one that would at least be as good as nobody !
Parsing [sent. 2947 len. 13]: I am sorry I do n't know how to give you room .
Parsing [sent. 2948 len. 6]: I would if I could .
Parsing [sent. 2949 len. 5]: Tell me how . ''
Parsing [sent. 2950 len. 16]: Again Ian turned to her : was it possible there were tears in her voice ?
Parsing [sent. 2951 len. 10]: But her black eyes were flashing in the starlight !
Parsing [sent. 2952 len. 8]: `` Did you ever read Zanoni ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2953 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 2954 len. 7]: `` I never heard of it .
Parsing [sent. 2955 len. 5]: What is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2956 len. 8]: `` A romance of Bulwer 's . ''
Parsing [sent. 2957 len. 13]: `` My father wo n't let us read anything of Bulwer 's .
Parsing [sent. 2958 len. 8]: Does he write very wicked books ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2959 len. 31]: `` The one I speak of , '' said Ian , `` is not wicked , though it is full of rubbish , and its religion is very false . ''
Parsing [sent. 2960 len. 19]: Whether Mercy meant to take her revenge on him with consciously bad logic , I am in doubt .
Parsing [sent. 2961 len. 4]: `` Captain Macruadh !
Parsing [sent. 2962 len. 4]: you astonish me !
Parsing [sent. 2963 len. 8]: A Scotchman speak so of religion ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2964 len. 10]: `` I spoke of the religion in that book .
Parsing [sent. 2965 len. 18]: I said it was false -- which is the same as saying it was not religion . ''
Parsing [sent. 2966 len. 9]: `` Then religion is not all true ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2967 len. 29]: `` All true religion is true , '' said Ian , inclined to laugh like one that thought to catch an angel , and had clutched a bat !
Parsing [sent. 2968 len. 28]: `` I was going on to say that , though the religion and philosophy of the book were rubbish , the story was fundamentally a grand conception .
Parsing [sent. 2969 len. 33]: It puzzles me to think how a man could start with such an idea , and work it out so well , and yet be so lacking both in insight and logic .
Parsing [sent. 2970 len. 22]: It is wonderful how much of one portion of our nature may be developed along with so little of another ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2971 len. 8]: `` What is the story about ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2972 len. 3]: asked Mercy .
Parsing [sent. 2973 len. 68]: `` What I may call the canvas of it , speaking as if it were a picture , is the idea that the whole of space is full of life ; that , as the smallest drop of water is crowded with monsters of hideous forms and dispositions , so is what we call space full of living creatures , -- '' `` How horrible ! '' ''
Parsing [sent. 2974 len. 7]: -- not all monsters , however .
Parsing [sent. 2975 len. 30]: There are among them creatures not altogether differing from us , but differing much from each other , -- '' `` As much as you and I ? '' ''
Parsing [sent. 2976 len. 23]: -- some of them lovely and friendly , others frightful in their beauty and malignity , -- '' `` What nonsense ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2977 len. 9]: `` Why do you call it nonsense ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2978 len. 9]: `` How could anything beautiful be frightful ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2979 len. 9]: `` I ought not to have said BEAUTIFUL .
Parsing [sent. 2980 len. 14]: But the frightfullest face I ever saw ought to have been the finest .
Parsing [sent. 2981 len. 14]: When the lady that owned it spoke to me , I shivered . ''
Parsing [sent. 2982 len. 10]: `` But anyhow the whole thing is nonsense ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2983 len. 7]: `` How is it nonsense ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2984 len. 9]: `` Because there are no such creatures . ''
Parsing [sent. 2985 len. 7]: `` How do you know that ?
Parsing [sent. 2986 len. 13]: Another may have seen them though you and I never did ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2987 len. 8]: `` You are making game of me !
Parsing [sent. 2988 len. 11]: You think to make me believe anything you choose ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2989 len. 11]: `` Will you tell me something you do believe ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2990 len. 14]: `` That you may prove immediately that I do not believe it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2991 len. 12]: she retorted , with more insight than he had expected . ''
Parsing [sent. 2992 len. 8]: -- You are not very entertaining ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2993 len. 13]: `` Would you like me to tell you a story then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2994 len. 7]: `` Will it be nonsense ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2995 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 2996 len. 9]: `` I should like a little nonsense . ''
Parsing [sent. 2997 len. 17]: `` You are an angel of goodness , and as wise as you are lovely ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2998 len. 3]: said Ian .
Parsing [sent. 2999 len. 23]: She turned upon him , and opened wide at him her great black eyes , in which were mingled defiance and question .
Parsing [sent. 3000 len. 9]: `` Your reasoning is worthy of your intellect .
Parsing [sent. 3001 len. 30]: When you dance , '' he went on , looking very solemn , `` your foot would not bend the neck of a daisy asleep in its rosy crown .
Parsing [sent. 3002 len. 31]: The west wind of May haunts you with its twilight-odours ; and when you waltz , so have I seen the waterspout gyrate on the blue floor of the Mediterranean .
Parsing [sent. 3003 len. 21]: Your voice is as the harp of Selma ; and when you look out of your welkin eyes -- no !
Parsing [sent. 3004 len. 5]: there I am wrong !
Parsing [sent. 3005 len. 3]: Allow me !
Parsing [sent. 3006 len. 7]: -- ah , I thought so !
Parsing [sent. 3007 len. 5]: -- dark as Erebus !
Parsing [sent. 3008 len. 5]: -- But what ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3009 len. 27]: For Mercy , perceiving at last that he was treating her like the silliest of small girls , lost her patience , and burst into tears .
Parsing [sent. 3010 len. 7]: `` You are dreadfully rude ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3011 len. 3]: she sobbed .
Parsing [sent. 3012 len. 6]: Ian was vexed with himself .
Parsing [sent. 3013 len. 13]: `` You asked me to talk nonsense to you , Miss Mercy !
Parsing [sent. 3014 len. 12]: I attempted to obey you , and have done it stupidly .
Parsing [sent. 3015 len. 8]: But at least it was absolute nonsense !
Parsing [sent. 3016 len. 14]: Shall I make up for it by telling you a pretty story ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3017 len. 8]: `` Anything to put away that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3018 len. 7]: answered Mercy , trying to smile .
Parsing [sent. 3019 len. 45]: He began at once , and told her a wonderful tale -- told first after this fashion by Bob of the Angels , at a winter-night gathering of the women , as they carded and spun their wool , and reeled their yarn together .
Parsing [sent. 3020 len. 36]: It was one well-known in the country , but Rob had filled it after his fancy with imaginative turns and spiritual hints , unappreciable by the tall child of seventeen walking by Ian 's side .
Parsing [sent. 3021 len. 21]: There was not among the maidens of the poor village one who would not have understood it better than she .
Parsing [sent. 3022 len. 22]: It took her fancy notwithstanding , partly , perhaps , from its unlikeness to any story she had ever heard before .
Parsing [sent. 3023 len. 31]: Her childhood had been starved on the husks of new fairy-tales , all invention and no imagination , than which more unnourishing food was never offered to God 's children .
Parsing [sent. 3024 len. 40]: The story Ian told her under that skyful of stars , was as Rob of the Angels had dressed it for the clan matrons and maidens , only altered a very little for the ears of the lowland girl .

Parsing [sent. 3049 len. 6]: THE STORY TOLD BY IAN .
Parsing [sent. 3050 len. 27]: `` There was once a woman whose husband was well to do , but he died and left her , and then she sank into poverty .
Parsing [sent. 3051 len. 36]: She did her best ; but she had a large family , and work was hard to find , and hard to do when it was found , and hardly paid when it was done .
Parsing [sent. 3052 len. 19]: Only hearts of grace can understand the struggles of the poor -- with everything but God against them !
Parsing [sent. 3053 len. 26]: But she trusted in God , and said whatever he pleased must be right , whether he sent it with his own hand or not .
Parsing [sent. 3054 len. 82]: `` Now , whether it was that she could not find them enough to eat , or that she could not keep them warm enough , I do not know ; I do not think it was that they had not gladness enough , which is as necessary for young things as food and air and sun , for it is wonderful on how little a child can be happy ; but whatever was the cause , they began to die .
Parsing [sent. 3055 len. 28]: One after the other sickened and lay down , and did not rise again ; and for a time her life was just a waiting upon death .
Parsing [sent. 3056 len. 34]: She would have wanted to die herself , but that there was always another to die first ; she had to see them all safe home before she dared wish to go herself .
Parsing [sent. 3057 len. 39]: But at length the last of them was gone , and then when she had no more to provide for , the heart of work went out of her : where was the good of working for herself !
Parsing [sent. 3058 len. 7]: there was no interest in it !
Parsing [sent. 3059 len. 54]: But she knew it was the will of God she should work and eat until he chose to take her back to himself ; so she worked on for her living while she would much rather have worked for her dying ; and comforted herself that every day brought death a day nearer .
Parsing [sent. 3060 len. 44]: Then she fell ill herself , and could work no more , and thought God was going to let her die ; for , able to win her bread no longer , surely she was free to lie down and wait for death !
Parsing [sent. 3061 len. 58]: But just as she was going to her bed for the last time , she bethought herself that she was bound to give her neighbour the chance of doing a good deed : and felt that any creature dying at her door without letting her know he was in want , would do her a great wrong .
Parsing [sent. 3062 len. 26]: She saw it was the will of God that she should beg , so put on her clothes again , and went out to beg .
Parsing [sent. 3063 len. 13]: It was sore work , and she said so to the priest .
Parsing [sent. 3064 len. 27]: But the priest told her she need not mind , for our Lord himself lived by the kindness of the women who went about with him .
Parsing [sent. 3065 len. 41]: They knew he could not make a living for his own body and a living for the souls of so many as well , and the least they could do was to keep him alive who was making them alive .
Parsing [sent. 3066 len. 26]: She said that was very true ; but he was all the time doing everything for everybody , and she was doing nothing for anybody .
Parsing [sent. 3067 len. 55]: The priest was a wise man , and did not tell her how she had , since ever he knew her , been doing the work of God in his heart , helping him to believe and trust in God ; so that in fact , when he was preaching , she was preaching .
Parsing [sent. 3068 len. 40]: He did not tell her that , I say , for he was jealous over her beauty , and would have Christ 's beloved sheep enter his holy kingdom with her wool white , however torn it might be .
Parsing [sent. 3069 len. 82]: So he left her to think she was nobody at all ; and told her that , whether she was worth keeping alive or not , whether she was worth begging for or not , whether it was a disgrace or an honour to beg , all was one , for it was the will of God that she should beg , and there was no word more to be said , and no thought more to be thought about it .
Parsing [sent. 3070 len. 20]: To this she heartily agreed , and did beg -- enough to keep her alive , and no more .
Parsing [sent. 3071 len. 27]: `` But at last she saw she must leave that part of the country , and go back to the place her husband took her from .
Parsing [sent. 3072 len. 35]: For the people about her were very poor , and she thought it hard on them to have to help a stranger like her ; also her own people would want her to bury .
Parsing [sent. 3073 len. 56]: For you must know that in the clans , marriage was thought to be dissolved by death , so far at least as the body was concerned ; therefore the body of a dead wife was generally carried back to the burial place of her own people , there to be gathered to her fathers .
Parsing [sent. 3074 len. 15]: So the woman set out for her own country , begging her way thither .
Parsing [sent. 3075 len. 45]: Nor had she any difficulty , for there were not a few poor people on her way , and the poor are the readiest to help the poor , also to know whether a person is one that ought to be helped or not .
Parsing [sent. 3076 len. 16]: `` One night she came to a farm house where a rich miserly farmer dwelt .
Parsing [sent. 3077 len. 40]: She knew about him , and had not meant to stop there , but she was weary , and the sun went down as she reached his gate , and she felt as if she could go no farther .
Parsing [sent. 3078 len. 20]: So she went up to the door and knocked , and asked if she could have a nights lodging .
Parsing [sent. 3079 len. 12]: The woman who opened to her went and asked the farmer .
Parsing [sent. 3080 len. 30]: Now the old man did not like hospitality , and in particular to such as stood most in need of it ; he did not enjoy throwing away money !
Parsing [sent. 3081 len. 46]: At the same time , however , he was very fond of hearing all the country rumours ; and he thought with himself he would buy her news with a scrap of what was going , and a shake-down at the foot of the wall .
Parsing [sent. 3082 len. 10]: So he told his servant to bring her in .
Parsing [sent. 3083 len. 30]: `` He received her not unkindly , for he wanted her to talk ; and he let her have a share of the supper , such as it was .
Parsing [sent. 3084 len. 38]: But not until he had asked every question about everybody he could think of , and drawn her own history from her as well , would he allow her to have the rest she so much needed .
Parsing [sent. 3085 len. 19]: `` Now it was a poor house , like most in the country , and nearly without partitions .
Parsing [sent. 3086 len. 45]: The old man had his warm box-bed , and slept on feathers where no draught could reach him , and the poor woman had her bed of short rumpled straw on the earthen floor at the foot of the wall in the coldest corner .
Parsing [sent. 3087 len. 29]: Yet the heart of the man had been moved by her story , for , without dwelling on her sufferings , she had been honest in telling it .
Parsing [sent. 3088 len. 22]: He had indeed , ere he went to sleep , thanked God that he was so much better off than she .
Parsing [sent. 3089 len. 36]: For if he did not think it the duty of the rich man to share with his neighbours , he at least thought it his duty to thank God for his being richer than they .
Parsing [sent. 3090 len. 50]: `` Now it may well seem strange that such a man should be privileged to see a vision ; but we do read in the Bible of a prophet who did not even know his duty to an ass , so that the ass had to teach it him .
Parsing [sent. 3091 len. 15]: And the man alone saw the vision ; the woman saw nothing of it .
Parsing [sent. 3092 len. 26]: But she did not require to see any vision , for she had truth in the inward parts , which is better than all visions .
Parsing [sent. 3093 len. 58]: The vision was on this wise : -- In the middle of the night the man came wide awake , and looking out of his bed , saw the door open , and a light come in , burning like a star , of a faint rosy colour , unlike any light he had ever before seen .
Parsing [sent. 3094 len. 17]: Another and another came in , and more yet , until he counted six of them .
Parsing [sent. 3095 len. 24]: They moved near the floor , but he could not see clearly what sort of little creatures they were that were carrying them .
Parsing [sent. 3096 len. 63]: They went up to the woman 's bed , and walked slowly round it in a hovering kind of a way , stopping , and moving up and down , and going on again ; and when they had done this three times , they went slowly out of the door again , stopping for a moment several times as they went .
Parsing [sent. 3097 len. 40]: `` He fell asleep , and waking not very early , was surprised to see his guest still on her hard couch -- as quiet as any rich woman , he said to himself , on her feather bed .
Parsing [sent. 3098 len. 26]: He woke her , told her he wondered she should sleep so far into the morning , and narrated the curious vision he had had .
Parsing [sent. 3099 len. 23]: ` Does not that explain to you , ' she said , ` how it is that I have slept so long ?
Parsing [sent. 3100 len. 11]: Those were my dead children you saw come to me .
Parsing [sent. 3101 len. 20]: They died young , without any sin , and God lets them come and comfort their poor sinful mother .
Parsing [sent. 3102 len. 8]: I often see them in my dreams .
Parsing [sent. 3103 len. 24]: If , when I am gone , you will look at my bed , you will find every straw laid straight and smooth .
Parsing [sent. 3104 len. 10]: That is what they were doing last night . '
Parsing [sent. 3105 len. 48]: Then she gave him thanks for good fare and good rest , and took her way to her own , leaving the farmer better pleased with himself than he had been for a long time , partly because there had been granted him a vision from heaven .
Parsing [sent. 3106 len. 17]: `` At last the woman died , and was carried by angels into Abraham 's bosom .
Parsing [sent. 3107 len. 19]: She was now with her own people indeed , that is , with God and all the good .
Parsing [sent. 3108 len. 40]: The old farmer did not know of her death till a long time after ; but it was upon the night she died , as near as he could then make out , that he dreamed a wonderful dream .
Parsing [sent. 3109 len. 37]: He never told it to any but the priest from whom he sought comfort when he lay dying ; and the priest did not tell it till after everybody belonging to the old man was gone .
Parsing [sent. 3110 len. 47]: This was the dream : -- `` He was lying awake in his own bed , as he thought , in the dark night , when the poor woman came in at the door , having in her hand a wax candle , but not alight .
Parsing [sent. 3111 len. 10]: He said to her , ` You extravagant woman !
Parsing [sent. 3112 len. 8]: where did you get that candle ? '
Parsing [sent. 3113 len. 34]: She answered , ` It was put into my hand when I died , with the word that I was to wander till I found a fire at which to light it . '
Parsing [sent. 3114 len. 4]: ` There ! '
Parsing [sent. 3115 len. 10]: said he , ` there 's the rested fire !
Parsing [sent. 3116 len. 9]: Blow and get a light , poor thing !
Parsing [sent. 3117 len. 13]: It shall never be said I refused a body a light ! '
Parsing [sent. 3118 len. 30]: She went to the hearth , and began to blow at the smouldering peat ; but , for all she kept trying , she could not light her candle .
Parsing [sent. 3119 len. 31]: The old man thought it was because she was dead , not because he was dead in sin , and losing his patience , cried , ` You foolish woman !
Parsing [sent. 3120 len. 11]: have n't you wit enough left to light a candle ?
Parsing [sent. 3121 len. 10]: It 's small wonder you came to beggary ! '
Parsing [sent. 3122 len. 22]: Still she went on trying , but the more she tried , the blacker grew the peat she was blowing at .
Parsing [sent. 3123 len. 34]: It would indeed blaze up at her breath , but the moment she brought the candle near it to catch the flame , it grew black , and each time blacker than before .
Parsing [sent. 3124 len. 3]: ` Tut !
Parsing [sent. 3125 len. 24]: give me the candle , ' cried the farmer , springing out of bed ; ' I will light it for you ! '
Parsing [sent. 3126 len. 25]: But as he stretched out his hand to take it , the woman disappeared , and he saw that the fire was dead out .
Parsing [sent. 3127 len. 8]: ` Here 's a fine business ! '
Parsing [sent. 3128 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 3129 len. 10]: ` How am I to get a light ? '
Parsing [sent. 3130 len. 9]: For he was miles from the next house .
Parsing [sent. 3131 len. 12]: And with that he turned to go back to his bed .
Parsing [sent. 3132 len. 13]: When he came near it , he saw somebody lying in it .
Parsing [sent. 3133 len. 3]: ` What !
Parsing [sent. 3134 len. 10]: has the carline got into my very bed ? '
Parsing [sent. 3135 len. 18]: he cried , and went to drive her out of the bed and out of the house .
Parsing [sent. 3136 len. 31]: But when he came close , he saw it was himself lying there , and knew that at least he was out of the body , if not downright dead .
Parsing [sent. 3137 len. 28]: The next moment he found himself on the moor , following the woman , some distance before him , with her unlighted candle still in her hand .
Parsing [sent. 3138 len. 30]: He walked as fast as he could to get up with her , hut could not ; he called after her , but she did not seem to hear .
Parsing [sent. 3139 len. 25]: `` When first he set out , he knew every step of the ground , but by and by he ceased to know it .
Parsing [sent. 3140 len. 14]: The moor stretched out endlessly , and the woman walked on and on .
Parsing [sent. 3141 len. 10]: Without a thought of turning back , he followed .
Parsing [sent. 3142 len. 15]: At length he saw a gate , seemingly in the side of a hill .
Parsing [sent. 3143 len. 20]: The woman knocked , and by the time it opened , he was near enough to hear what passed .
Parsing [sent. 3144 len. 25]: It was a grave and stately , but very happy-looking man that opened it , and he knew at once it was St. Peter .
Parsing [sent. 3145 len. 12]: When he saw the woman , he stooped and kissed her .
Parsing [sent. 3146 len. 35]: The same moment a light shone from her , and the old man thought her candle was lighted at last ; but presently he saw it was her head that gave out the shining .
Parsing [sent. 3147 len. 43]: And he heard her say , ' I pray you , St. Peter , remember the rich tenant of Balmacoy ; he gave me shelter one whole night , and would have let me light my candle but I could not . '
Parsing [sent. 3148 len. 28]: St. Peter answered , ` His fire was not fire enough to light your candle , and the bed he gave you was of short straw ! '
Parsing [sent. 3149 len. 31]: ` True , St. Peter , ' said the woman , ` but he gave me some supper , and it is hard for a rich man to be generous !
Parsing [sent. 3150 len. 24]: You may say the supper was not very good , but at least it was more than a cup of cold water ! '
Parsing [sent. 3151 len. 6]: ` Yes , verily ! '
Parsing [sent. 3152 len. 36]: answered the saint , ` but he did not give it you because you loved God , or because you were in need of it , but because he wanted to hear your news . '
Parsing [sent. 3153 len. 23]: Then the woman was sad , for she could not think of anything more to say for the poor old rich man .
Parsing [sent. 3154 len. 34]: And St. Peter saw that she was sad , and said , ` But if he die to-night , he shall have a place inside the gate , because you pray for him .
Parsing [sent. 3155 len. 6]: He shall lie there ! '
Parsing [sent. 3156 len. 21]: And he pointed to just such a bed of short crumpled straw as she had lain upon in his house .
Parsing [sent. 3157 len. 16]: But she said , ` St. Peter , you ought to be ashamed of yourself !
Parsing [sent. 3158 len. 13]: Is that the kind of welcome to give a poor new-dead man ?
Parsing [sent. 3159 len. 15]: Where then would he have lain if I had not prayed for him ? '
Parsing [sent. 3160 len. 12]: ` In the dog-kennel outside there , ' answered St. Peter .
Parsing [sent. 3161 len. 21]: ` Oh , then , please , let me go back and warn him what comes of loving money ! '
Parsing [sent. 3162 len. 3]: she pleaded .
Parsing [sent. 3163 len. 30]: ` That is not necessary , ' he replied ; ` the man is hearing every word you and I are this moment saying to each other . ' '
Parsing [sent. 3164 len. 6]: I am so glad ! '
Parsing [sent. 3165 len. 12]: rejoined the woman ; ` it will make him repent . '
Parsing [sent. 3166 len. 13]: ` He will not be a straw the better for it ! '
Parsing [sent. 3167 len. 4]: answered the saint .
Parsing [sent. 3168 len. 36]: ` He thinks now that he will do differently , and perhaps when he wakes will think so still ; but in a day or two he will mock at it as a foolish dream .
Parsing [sent. 3169 len. 19]: To gather money will seem to him common sense , and to lay up treasure in heaven nonsense .
Parsing [sent. 3170 len. 16]: A bird in the hand will be to him worth ten in the heavenly bush .
Parsing [sent. 3171 len. 32]: And the end will be that he will not get the straw inside the gate , and there will be many worse places than the dog-kennel too good for him ! '
Parsing [sent. 3172 len. 6]: With that he woke . ''
Parsing [sent. 3173 len. 7]: ` What an odd dream ! '
Parsing [sent. 3174 len. 6]: he said to himself . '
Parsing [sent. 3175 len. 10]: I had better mind what I am about ! '
Parsing [sent. 3176 len. 20]: So he was better that day , eating and drinking more freely , and giving more to his people .
Parsing [sent. 3177 len. 30]: But the rest of the week he was worse than ever , trying to save what he had that day spent , and so he went on growing worse .
Parsing [sent. 3178 len. 23]: When he found himself dying , the terror of his dream came upon him , and he told all to the priest .
Parsing [sent. 3179 len. 9]: But the priest could not comfort him . ''
Parsing [sent. 3180 len. 61]: By the time the story was over , to which Mercy had listened without a word , they were alone in the great starry night , on the side of a hill , with the snow high above them , and the heavens above the snow , and the stars above the heavens , and God above and below everything .
Parsing [sent. 3181 len. 6]: Only Ian felt his presence .
Parsing [sent. 3182 len. 7]: Mercy had not missed him yet .
Parsing [sent. 3183 len. 13]: She did not see much in the tale : how could she ?
Parsing [sent. 3184 len. 13]: It was very odd , she thought , but not very interesting .
Parsing [sent. 3185 len. 12]: She had expected a tale of clan-feud , or a love-story !
Parsing [sent. 3186 len. 16]: Yet the seriousness of her companion in its narration had made some impression upon her .
Parsing [sent. 3187 len. 22]: `` They told me you were an officer , '' she said , `` but I see you are a clergyman !
Parsing [sent. 3188 len. 11]: Do you tell stories like that from the pulpit ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3189 len. 15]: `` I am a soldier , '' answered Ian , `` not a clergyman .
Parsing [sent. 3190 len. 15]: But I have heard my father tell such a story from the pulpit . ''
Parsing [sent. 3191 len. 12]: Ian imagined himself foiled in his attempt to interest the maiden .
Parsing [sent. 3192 len. 10]: If he was , it would not be surprising .
Parsing [sent. 3193 len. 24]: He had not the least desire to commend HIMSELF to the girl ; and he would not talk rubbish even to a child .
Parsing [sent. 3194 len. 12]: There is sensible and senseless nonsense , good absurdity and bad .
Parsing [sent. 3195 len. 19]: As Mercy recounted to her sister the story Ian had told her , it certainly was silly enough .
Parsing [sent. 3196 len. 16]: She had retained but the withered stalk and leaves ; the strange flower was gone .
Parsing [sent. 3197 len. 14]: Christina judged it hardly a story for a gentleman to tell a lady .
Parsing [sent. 3198 len. 21]: They returned almost in silence to find the table laid , a plentiful supper spread , and the company seated .
Parsing [sent. 3199 len. 16]: After supper came singing of songs , saying of ballads , and telling of tales .
Parsing [sent. 3200 len. 34]: I know with what in - credulity many highlanders will read of a merry-making in their own country at which no horn went round , no punch-bowl was filled and emptied without stint !
Parsing [sent. 3201 len. 20]: But the clearer the brain , the better justice is done to the more etherial wine of fthe soul .
Parsing [sent. 3202 len. 37]: Of several of the old songs Christina begged the tunes , but was disappointed to find that , as she could not take them down , so the singers of them could not set them down .
Parsing [sent. 3203 len. 8]: In the tales she found no interest .
Parsing [sent. 3204 len. 75]: The hostess sang to her harp , and made to revering listeners eloquent music , for her high clear tones had not yet lost their sweetness , and she had some art to come in aid of her much feeling : loud murmurs of delight , in the soft strange tongue of the songs themselves , followed the profound silence with which they were heard , but Christina wondered what there was to applaud .
Parsing [sent. 3205 len. 26]: She could not herself sing without accompaniment , and when she left , it was with a regretful feeling that she had not distinguished herself .
Parsing [sent. 3206 len. 60]: Naturally , as they went home , the guests from the New House had much fun over the queer fashions and poverty -- stricken company , the harp and the bagpipes , the horrible haggis , the wild minor songs , and the unintelligible stories and jokes ; but the ladies agreed that the Macruadh was a splendid fellow .
Parsing [sent. 3207 len. 7]: CHAPTER II ROB OF THE ANGELS .
Parsing [sent. 3208 len. 27]: Among the peasantry assembled at the feast , were two that had neither danced , nor seated themselves at the long table where all were welcome .
Parsing [sent. 3209 len. 11]: Mercy wondered what might be the reason of their separation .
Parsing [sent. 3210 len. 76]: Her first thought was that they must be somehow , she could not well imagine how , in lower position than any of the rest -- had perhaps offended against the law , perhaps been in prison , and so the rest would not keep company with them ; or perhaps they were beggars who did not belong to the clan , and therefore , although fed , were not allowed to eat with it !
Parsing [sent. 3211 len. 45]: But she soon saw she must be wrong in each conjecture ; for if there was any avoiding , it was on the part of the two : every one , it was clear , was almost on the alert to wait upon them .
Parsing [sent. 3212 len. 36]: They seemed indeed rather persons of distinction than outcasts ; for it was with something like homage , except for a certain coaxing tone in the speech of the ministrants , that they were attended .
Parsing [sent. 3213 len. 14]: They had to help themselves to nothing ; everything was carried to them .
Parsing [sent. 3214 len. 55]: Now one , now another , where all were guests and all were servants , would rise from the table to offer them something , or see what they would choose or might be in want of , while they partook with the same dignity and self-restraint that was to be noted in all .
Parsing [sent. 3215 len. 26]: The elder was a man about five-and-fifty , tall and lean , with a wiry frame , dark grizzled hair , and a shaven face .
Parsing [sent. 3216 len. 64]: His dress , which was in the style of the country , was very poor , but decent ; only his plaid was large and thick , and bright compared with the rest of his apparel : it was a present he had had from his clan-some giving the wool , and others the labour in carding , dyeing , and weaving it .
Parsing [sent. 3217 len. 16]: He carried himself like a soldier-which he had never been , though his father had .
Parsing [sent. 3218 len. 21]: His eyes were remarkably clear and keen , and the way he used them could hardly fail to attract attention .
Parsing [sent. 3219 len. 44]: Every now and then they would suddenly fix themselves with a gaze of earnest inquiry , which would either grow to perception , or presently melt away and let his glance go gently roving , ready to receive , but looking for nothing .
Parsing [sent. 3220 len. 14]: His face was very brown and healthy , with marked and handsome features .
Parsing [sent. 3221 len. 21]: Its expression seemed at first a little severe , but soon , to reading eyes , disclosed patience and tenderness .
Parsing [sent. 3222 len. 26]: At the same time there was in it a something indescribably unlike the other faces present-and indeed his whole person and carriage were similarly peculiar .
Parsing [sent. 3223 len. 20]: Had Mercy , however , spent on him a little more attention , the peculiarity would have explained itself .
Parsing [sent. 3224 len. 40]: She would have seen that , although everybody spoke to him , he never spoke in reply -- only made signs , sometimes with his lips , oftener with hand or head : the man was deaf and dumb .
Parsing [sent. 3225 len. 29]: But such was the keenness of his observation that he understood everything said to him by one he knew , and much from the lips of a stranger .
Parsing [sent. 3226 len. 15]: His companion was a youth whose age it would have been difficult to guess .
Parsing [sent. 3227 len. 12]: He looked a lad , and was not far from thirty .
Parsing [sent. 3228 len. 27]: His clothing was much like his father 's -- poor enough , yet with the air of being a better suit than that worn every day .
Parsing [sent. 3229 len. 25]: He was very pale and curiously freckled , with great gray eyes like his father 's , which had however an altogether different expression .
Parsing [sent. 3230 len. 34]: They looked dreamy , and seemed almost careless of what passed before them , though now and then a certain quick , sharp turn of the head showed him not devoid of attention .
Parsing [sent. 3231 len. 9]: The relation between the two was strangely interesting .
Parsing [sent. 3232 len. 7]: Day and night they were inseparable .
Parsing [sent. 3233 len. 56]: Because the father was deaf , the son gave all his attention to the sounds of the world ; his soul sat in his ears , ever awake , ever listening ; while such was his confidence in his father 's sight , that he scarcely troubled himself to look where he set his feet .
Parsing [sent. 3234 len. 16]: His expression also was peculiar , partly from this cause , mainly from a deeper .
Parsing [sent. 3235 len. 24]: It was a far-away look , which a common glance would have taken to indicate that he was `` not all there . ''
Parsing [sent. 3236 len. 35]: In a lowland parish he would have been regarded as little better than a gifted idiot ; in the mountains he was looked upon as a seer , one in communion with higher powers .
Parsing [sent. 3237 len. 45]: Whether his people were of this opinion from being all fools together , and therefore unable to know a fool , or the lowland authorities would have been right in taking charge of him , let him who pleases judge or misjudge for himself .
Parsing [sent. 3238 len. 26]: What his own thought of him came out in the name they gave him : `` Rob of the Angels , '' they called him .
Parsing [sent. 3239 len. 14]: He was nearly a foot shorter than his father , and very thin .
Parsing [sent. 3240 len. 33]: Some said he looked always cold ; but I think that came of the wonderful peace on his face , like the quiet of a lake over which lies a thin mist .
Parsing [sent. 3241 len. 23]: Never was stronger or fuller devotion manifested by son to father than by Rob of the Angels to Hector of the Stags .
Parsing [sent. 3242 len. 8]: His filial love and faith were perfect .
Parsing [sent. 3243 len. 34]: While they were together , he was in his own calm elysium ; when they were apart , which was seldom for more than a few minutes , his spirit seemed always waiting .
Parsing [sent. 3244 len. 29]: I believe his notions of God his father , and Hector his father , were strangely mingled -- the more perhaps that the two fathers were equally silent .
Parsing [sent. 3245 len. 24]: It would have been a valuable revelation to some theologians to see in those two what & lti > love </i> might mean .
Parsing [sent. 3246 len. 27]: So gentle was Rob of the Angels , that all the women , down to the youngest maid-child , gave him a compassionate , mother-like love .
Parsing [sent. 3247 len. 55]: He had lost his mother when he was an infant ; the father had brought him up with his own hand , and from the moment of his mother 's departure had scarce let him out of his sight ; but the whole woman-remnant of the clan was as a mother to the boy .
Parsing [sent. 3248 len. 60]: And from the first they had so talked to him of his mother , greatly no doubt through the feeling that from his father he could learn nothing of her , that now his mother seemed to him everywhere : he could not see God ; why should not his mother be there though he could not see her !
Parsing [sent. 3249 len. 7]: No wonder the man was peaceful !
Parsing [sent. 3250 len. 63]: Many would be inclined to call the two but poachers and vagabonds -- vagabonds because they lived in houses not quite made with hands , for they had several dwellings that were mostly caves -- which yet they contrived to make warm and comfortable ; and poachers because they lived by the creatures which God scatters on his hills for his humans .
Parsing [sent. 3251 len. 35]: Let those who inherit or purchase , avenge the breach of law ; but let them not wonder when those who are disinherited and sold , cry out against the breach of higher law !
Parsing [sent. 3252 len. 49]: The land here had never , partly from the troubles besetting its owners , but more from their regard for the poor , of the clan , been with any care preserved ; little notice was ever taken of what game was killed , or who killed it .
Parsing [sent. 3253 len. 31]: At the same time any wish of the chief with regard to the deer , of which Rob 's father for one knew every antlered head , was rigidly respected .
Parsing [sent. 3254 len. 46]: As to the parts which became the property of others-the boundaries between were not very definite , and sale could ill change habits , especially where owners were but beginning to bestir themselves about the deer , or any of the wild animals called game .
Parsing [sent. 3255 len. 13]: Hector and Rob led their life with untroubled conscience and easy mind .
Parsing [sent. 3256 len. 103]: In a world of the devil , where the justification of existence lay in money on the one side , and work for money on the other , there could be no justification of the existence of these men ; but this world does not belong to the devil , though it may often seem as if it did , and father and son lived and enjoyed life , as in a manner so to a decree unintelligible to him who , without his money and its consolations , would know himself in the hell he has not yet recog - nized .
Parsing [sent. 3257 len. 144]: Neither of them could read or write ; neither of them had a penny laid by for wet weather ; neither of them would leave any memory beyond their generation ; the will of neither would be laid up in Doctors ' Commons ; neither of the two would leave on record a single fact concerning one of the animals whose ways and habits they knew better than any other man in the highlands ; that they were nothing , and worth nothing to anybody -- even to themselves , would have been the judgment of most strangers concerning them ; but God knew what a life of unspeakable pleasures it was that he had given them-a life the change from which to the life beyond , would scarce be distracting : neither would find himself much out of doors when he died .
Parsing [sent. 3258 len. 57]: To Bob of the Angels tow could Abraham 's bosom feel strange , accustomed to lie night after night , star-melted and soft-breathing , or snow-ghastly and howling , with his head on -- the bosom of Hector of the Stags-an Abraham who could as ill do without his Isaac , as his Isaac without him !
Parsing [sent. 3259 len. 14]: The father trusted his son 's hearing as implicitly as his own sight .
Parsing [sent. 3260 len. 50]: When he saw a certain look come on his face , he would drop on the instant , and crouch as still as if he had ears and knew what noise was , watching Kob 's face for news of some sound wandering through the vast of the night .
Parsing [sent. 3261 len. 26]: It seemed at times , however , as if either he was not quite deaf , or he had some gift that went toward compensation .
Parsing [sent. 3262 len. 13]: To all motion about him he was sensitive as no other man .
Parsing [sent. 3263 len. 24]: I am afraid to say from how far off the solid earth would convey to him the vibration of a stag 's footstep .
Parsing [sent. 3264 len. 19]: Bob sometimes thought his cheek must feel the wind of a sound to which his ear was irresponsive .
Parsing [sent. 3265 len. 28]: Beyond a doubt he was occasionally aware of the proximity of an animal , and knew what animal it was , of which Rob had no intimation .
Parsing [sent. 3266 len. 22]: His being , corporeal and spiritual , seemed , to the ceaseless vibrations of the great globe , a very seismograph .
Parsing [sent. 3267 len. 26]: Often would he make his sign to Kob to lay his ear on the ground and listen , when no indication had reached the latter .
Parsing [sent. 3268 len. 15]: I suspect the exceptional development in him of some sense rudimentary in us all .
Parsing [sent. 3269 len. 14]: He had the keenest eyes in Glenruadh , and was a dead shot .
Parsing [sent. 3270 len. 8]: Even the chief was not his equal .
Parsing [sent. 3271 len. 15]: Yet he never stalked a deer , never killed anything , for mere sport .
Parsing [sent. 3272 len. 29]: I am not certain he never had , but for Rob of the Angels , he had the deep-rooted feeling of his chief in regard to the animals .
Parsing [sent. 3273 len. 41]: What they wanted for food , they would kill ; but it was not much they needed , for seldom can two men have lived on less , and they had positively not a greed of any kind between them .
Parsing [sent. 3274 len. 47]: If their necessity was meal or potatoes , they would carry grouse or hares down the glen , or arrange with some farmer 's wife , perhaps Mrs. Macruadh herself , for the haunches of a doe ; but they never killed from pleasure in killing .
Parsing [sent. 3275 len. 50]: Of creatures destructive to game they killed enough to do far more than make up for all the game they took ; and for the skins of ermine and stoat and fox and otter they could always get money 's worth ; money itself they never sought or had .
Parsing [sent. 3276 len. 38]: If the little birds be regarded as earning the fruit and seed they devour by the grubs and slugs they destroy , then Hector of the Stags and Rob of the Angels also thoroughly earned their food .
Parsing [sent. 3277 len. 20]: When a trustworthy messenger was wanted , and Rob was within reach , he was sure to be employed .
Parsing [sent. 3278 len. 12]: But not even then were his father and he quite parted .
Parsing [sent. 3279 len. 21]: Hector would shoulder his gun , and follow in the track of his fleet-footed son till he met him returning .
Parsing [sent. 3280 len. 12]: For what was life to Hector but to be with Rob !
Parsing [sent. 3281 len. 12]: Was his Mary 's son to go about the world unattended !
Parsing [sent. 3282 len. 23]: He had a yet stronger feeling than any of the clan that his son was not of the common race of mortals .
Parsing [sent. 3283 len. 43]: To Hector also , after their own fashion , would Rob of the Angels tell the tales that suggested the name his clanspeople gave him -- wonderful tales of the high mountain-nights , the actors in them for the most part angels .
Parsing [sent. 3284 len. 72]: Whether Rob believed he had intercourse with such beings , heard them speak , and saw them , do the things he reported , I can not tell : it may be that , like any other poet of good things , he but saw and believed the things his tales meant , the things with which he represented the angels as dealing , and concerning which he told their sayings .
Parsing [sent. 3285 len. 40]: To the eyes of those who knew him , Rob seemed just the sort of person with whom the angels might be well pleased to hold converse : was he not simplicity itself , truth , generosity , helpfulness ?
Parsing [sent. 3286 len. 24]: Did he not , when a child , all but lose his life in the rescue of an idiot from the swollen burn ?
Parsing [sent. 3287 len. 27]: Did he not , when a boy , fight a great golden eagle on its nest , thinking to deliver the lamb it had carried away ?
Parsing [sent. 3288 len. 42]: Knowing his father in want of a new bonnet , did not Rob with his bare hands seize an otter at the mouth of its hole , and carry it home , laughing merrily over the wounds it had given him ?
Parsing [sent. 3289 len. 18]: His voice had in it a strangely peculiar tone , making it seem not of this world .
Parsing [sent. 3290 len. 32]: Especially after he had been talking for some time , it would appear to come from far away , not from the lips of the man looking you in the face .
Parsing [sent. 3291 len. 19]: It was wonderful with what solemnity of speech , and purity of form he would tell his tales .
Parsing [sent. 3292 len. 30]: So much in solitude with his dumb father , his speech might well be unlike the speech of other men ; but whence the impression of cultivation it produced ?
Parsing [sent. 3293 len. 30]: When the Christmas party broke up , most of the guests took the road toward the village , the chief and his brother accompanying them part of the way .
Parsing [sent. 3294 len. 34]: Of these were Rob and his father , walking hand in hand , Hector looking straight before him , Rob gazing up into the heavens , as if holding counsel with the stars .
Parsing [sent. 3295 len. 10]: `` Are you seeing any angels , Rob ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3296 len. 7]: asked a gentle girl of ten .
Parsing [sent. 3297 len. 16]: `` Well , and I 'm not sure , '' answered Rob of the Angels .
Parsing [sent. 3298 len. 11]: `` Sure you can tell whether you see anything ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3299 len. 8]: `` Oh , yes , I see !
Parsing [sent. 3300 len. 17]: but it is not easy to tell what will be an angel and what will not .
Parsing [sent. 3301 len. 25]: There 's so much all blue up there , it might be full of angels and none of us see one of them ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3302 len. 18]: `` Do tell us what you see , Rob , dear Rob , '' said the girl .
Parsing [sent. 3303 len. 9]: `` Well , and I will tell you .
Parsing [sent. 3304 len. 12]: I think I see many heads close together , talking . ''
Parsing [sent. 3305 len. 12]: `` And can you hear what they will be saying ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3306 len. 6]: `` Some of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3307 len. 11]: `` Tell me , do tell me-some-just a little . ''
Parsing [sent. 3308 len. 35]: `` Well then , they are saying , one to the other -- not very plain , but I can hear -- they are saying , ' I wonder when people will be good !
Parsing [sent. 3309 len. 21]: It would be so easy , if only they would mean it , and begin when they are little ! '
Parsing [sent. 3310 len. 16]: That 's what they are saying as they look down on us walking along . ''
Parsing [sent. 3311 len. 10]: `` That will be good advice , Rob ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3312 len. 6]: said one of the women .
Parsing [sent. 3313 len. 41]: `` And , '' he resumed , `` they are saying now -- at least that is what it sounds to me -- ' I wish women were as good as they were when they were little girls ! ' ''
Parsing [sent. 3314 len. 11]: `` Now I know they are not saying that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3315 len. 4]: remarked the woman .
Parsing [sent. 3316 len. 10]: `` How should the angels trouble themselves about us !
Parsing [sent. 3317 len. 20]: Rob , dear , confess you are making it up , because the child would be asking you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3318 len. 14]: Rob made no answer , but some saw him smile a curious smile .
Parsing [sent. 3319 len. 15]: Rob would never defend anything he had said , or dispute anything another said .
Parsing [sent. 3320 len. 10]: After a moment or two , he spoke again .
Parsing [sent. 3321 len. 21]: `` Shall I be telling you what I heard them saying to each other this last night of all ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3322 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 3323 len. 8]: `` Yes , do , do ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3324 len. 13]: `` It was upon Dorrachbeg ; and there were two of them .
Parsing [sent. 3325 len. 21]: They were sitting together in the moon -- in the correi on the side of the hill over the village .
Parsing [sent. 3326 len. 26]: I was lying in a bush near them , for I could not sleep , and came out , and the night was not cold .
Parsing [sent. 3327 len. 20]: Now I would never be so bad-mannered as to listen where persons did not want me to hear . ''
Parsing [sent. 3328 len. 11]: `` What were they like , Rob , dear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3329 len. 4]: interrupted the girl .
Parsing [sent. 3330 len. 52]: `` That does not matter much , '' answered Rob ; `` but they were white , and their eyes not so white , but brighter ; for so many sad things go in at their eyes when they come down to the earth , that it makes them dark . ''
Parsing [sent. 3331 len. 13]: `` How could they be brighter and darker both at once ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3332 len. 7]: asked the girl , very pertinently .
Parsing [sent. 3333 len. 10]: `` I will tell you , '' answered Rob .
Parsing [sent. 3334 len. 52]: `` The dark things that go in at their eyes , they have to burn them in the fire of faith ; and it is the fire of that burning that makes their eyes bright ; it is the fire of their faith burning up the sad things they see . ''
Parsing [sent. 3335 len. 5]: `` Oh , yes !
Parsing [sent. 3336 len. 5]: I understand now ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3337 len. 4]: said the girl .
Parsing [sent. 3338 len. 11]: `` And what were their clothes like , Rob ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3339 len. 17]: `` When you see the angels , you do n't think much about their clothes . ''
Parsing [sent. 3340 len. 8]: `` And what were they saying ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3341 len. 23]: `` I spoke first -- the moment I saw them , for I was not sure they knew that I was there .
Parsing [sent. 3342 len. 11]: I said , ' I am here , gentlemen . '
Parsing [sent. 3343 len. 11]: ` Yes , we know that , ' they answered .
Parsing [sent. 3344 len. 10]: ` Are you far from home , gentlemen ? '
Parsing [sent. 3345 len. 3]: I asked .
Parsing [sent. 3346 len. 12]: ` It is all one for that , ' they answered .
Parsing [sent. 3347 len. 38]: ` Well , ' said I , ` it is true , gentlemen , for you seem as much at home here on the side of Dorrachbeg , as if it was a hill in paradise ! '
Parsing [sent. 3348 len. 11]: ` And how do you know it is not ? '
Parsing [sent. 3349 len. 3]: said they .
Parsing [sent. 3350 len. 19]: ` Because I see people do upon it as they would not in paradise , ' I answered .
Parsing [sent. 3351 len. 4]: ` Ah ! '
Parsing [sent. 3352 len. 18]: said one of them , ` the hill may be in paradise , and the people not !
Parsing [sent. 3353 len. 10]: But you can not understand these things . ' '
Parsing [sent. 3354 len. 36]: I think I do , ' I said ; ` but surely , if you did let them know they were on a hill in paradise , they would not do as they do ! '
Parsing [sent. 3355 len. 25]: ` It would be no use telling them , ' said he ; ` but , oh , how they spoil the house ! '
Parsing [sent. 3356 len. 17]: ` Are the red deer , and the hares , and the birds in paradise ? '
Parsing [sent. 3357 len. 3]: I asked .
Parsing [sent. 3358 len. 5]: ` Certain sure ! '
Parsing [sent. 3359 len. 3]: he answered .
Parsing [sent. 3360 len. 7]: ` Do they know it ? '
Parsing [sent. 3361 len. 21]: said I. ` No , it is not necessary for them ; but they will know it one day . '
Parsing [sent. 3362 len. 13]: ` You do not mind your little brother asking you questions ? '
Parsing [sent. 3363 len. 3]: I said .
Parsing [sent. 3364 len. 16]: ` Ask a hundred , if you will , little brother , ' he replied .
Parsing [sent. 3365 len. 12]: ` Then tell me why you are down here to-night . '
Parsing [sent. 3366 len. 31]: ` My friend and I came out for a walk , and we thought we would look to see when the village down there will have to be reaped . '
Parsing [sent. 3367 len. 7]: ` What do you mean ? '
Parsing [sent. 3368 len. 3]: I said .
Parsing [sent. 3369 len. 53]: ` You can not see what we see , ' they answered ; ` but a human place is like a flower , or a field of corn , and grows ripe , or wo n't grow ripe , and then some of us up there have to sharpen our sickles . '
Parsing [sent. 3370 len. 4]: ` What ! '
Parsing [sent. 3371 len. 21]: said I , for a great fear came upon me , ` they are not wicked people down there ! '
Parsing [sent. 3372 len. 13]: ` No , not very wicked , but slow and dull . '
Parsing [sent. 3373 len. 23]: Then I could say nothing more for a while , and they did not speak either , but sat looking before them .
Parsing [sent. 3374 len. 11]: ` Can you go and come as you please ? '
Parsing [sent. 3375 len. 5]: I asked at length .
Parsing [sent. 3376 len. 13]: ` Yes , just as we are sent , ' they answered .
Parsing [sent. 3377 len. 21]: ` Would you not like better to go and come of yourselves , as my father and I do ? '
Parsing [sent. 3378 len. 3]: I said .
Parsing [sent. 3379 len. 32]: ` No , ' answered both of them , and something in their one voice almost frightened me ; ` it is better than everything to go where we are sent .
Parsing [sent. 3380 len. 27]: If we had to go and come at our own will , we should be miserable , for we do not love our own will . '
Parsing [sent. 3381 len. 8]: ` Not love your own will ? '
Parsing [sent. 3382 len. 8]: ` No , not at all ! '
Parsing [sent. 3383 len. 4]: ` Why ? '
Parsing [sent. 3384 len. 13]: ` Because there is one -- oh , ever so much better !
Parsing [sent. 3385 len. 29]: When you and your father are quite good , you will not be left to go and come at your own will any more than we are . '
Parsing [sent. 3386 len. 14]: And I cried out , and said , ` Oh , dear angel !
Parsing [sent. 3387 len. 5]: you frighten me ! '
Parsing [sent. 3388 len. 50]: And he said , ` That is because you are only a man , and not a -- ' Now I am not sure of the word he said next ; bat I think it was CHRISTIAN ; and I do not quite know what the word meant . ''
Parsing [sent. 3389 len. 7]: `` Oh , Rob , dear !
Parsing [sent. 3390 len. 5]: everybody knows that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3391 len. 4]: exclaimed the girl .
Parsing [sent. 3392 len. 6]: But Rob said no more .
Parsing [sent. 3393 len. 52]: While he was talking , Alister had come up behind him , with Annie of the shop , and he said -- `` Rob , my friend , I know what you mean , and I want to hear the rest of it : what did the angels say next ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3394 len. 51]: `` They said , '' answered Rob , '' -- ` Was it your will set you on this beautiful hill , with all these things to love , with such air to breathe , such a father as you 've got , and such grand deer about you ? '
Parsing [sent. 3395 len. 7]: ` No , ' I answered .
Parsing [sent. 3396 len. 30]: ` Then , ' said the angel , ` there must be a better will than yours , for you would never have even thought of such things ! '
Parsing [sent. 3397 len. 12]: ` How could I , when I was n't made ? '
Parsing [sent. 3398 len. 8]: said I. ` There it is ! '
Parsing [sent. 3399 len. 8]: he returned , and said no more .
Parsing [sent. 3400 len. 19]: I looked up , and the moon was shining , and there were no angels on the stone .
Parsing [sent. 3401 len. 20]: But a little way off was my father , come out to see what had become of me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3402 len. 14]: `` Now did you really see and hear all that , Rob ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3403 len. 3]: said Alister .
Parsing [sent. 3404 len. 58]: Rob smiled a beautiful smile -- with something in it common people would call idiotic -- stopped and turned , took the chief 's hand , and carried it to his lips ; but not a word more would he speak , and soon they came where the path of the two turned away over the hill .
Parsing [sent. 3405 len. 12]: `` Will you not come and sleep at our house ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3406 len. 6]: said one of the company .
Parsing [sent. 3407 len. 6]: But they made kindly excuse .
Parsing [sent. 3408 len. 13]: `` The hill-side would miss us ; we are expected home ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3409 len. 55]: said Rob -- and away they climbed to their hut , a hollow in a limestone rock , with a front wall of turf , there to sleep side by side till the morning came , or , as Rob would have said , `` till the wind of the sun woke them . ''
Parsing [sent. 3410 len. 39]: Rob of the Angels made songs , and would sing one sometimes ; but they were in Gaelic , and the more poetic a thing , the more inadequate at least , if not stupid is its translation .
Parsing [sent. 3411 len. 24]: He had all the old legends of the country in his head , and many stories of ghosts and of the second sight .
Parsing [sent. 3412 len. 96]: These stories he would tell exactly as he had heard them , showing he believed every word of them ; but with such of the legends as were plainly no other than poetic inventions , he would take what liberties he pleased -- and they lost nothing by it ; for he not only gave them touches of fresh interest , but sent glimmering through them hints of something higher , of which ordinary natures perceived nothing , while others were dimly aware of a loftier intent : according to his listeners was their hearing .
Parsing [sent. 3413 len. 32]: In Rob 's stories , as in all the finer work of genius , a man would find as much as , and no more than , he was capable of .
Parsing [sent. 3414 len. 12]: Ian 's opinion of Rob was even higher than Alister 's .
Parsing [sent. 3415 len. 18]: `` What do you think , Ian , of the stories Rob of the Angels tells ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3416 len. 8]: asked Alister , as they walked home .
Parsing [sent. 3417 len. 21]: `` That the Lord has chosen the weak things of the world to confound the mighty , '' answered Ian .
Parsing [sent. 3418 len. 3]: `` Tut !
Parsing [sent. 3419 len. 5]: Rob confounds nobody . ''
Parsing [sent. 3420 len. 9]: `` He confounds me , '' returned Ian .
Parsing [sent. 3421 len. 9]: `` Does he believe what he tells ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3422 len. 16]: `` He believes all of it that is to be believed , '' replied Ian .
Parsing [sent. 3423 len. 9]: `` You are as bad as he ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3424 len. 3]: rejoined Alister .
Parsing [sent. 3425 len. 13]: `` There is no telling , sometimes , what you mean ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3426 len. 18]: `` Tell me this , Alister : can a thing be believed that is not true ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3427 len. 6]: `` Yes , certainly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3428 len. 6]: `` I say , NO .
Parsing [sent. 3429 len. 10]: Can you eat that which is not bread ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3430 len. 14]: `` I have seen a poor fellow gnawing a stick for hunger ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3431 len. 3]: answered Alister .
Parsing [sent. 3432 len. 5]: `` Yes , gnawing !
Parsing [sent. 3433 len. 6]: but gnawing is not eating .
Parsing [sent. 3434 len. 8]: Did the poor fellow eat the stick ?
Parsing [sent. 3435 len. 5]: That is just it !
Parsing [sent. 3436 len. 17]: Many a man will gnaw at a lie all his life , and perish of want .
Parsing [sent. 3437 len. 20]: I mean LIE , of course , the real lie -- a thing which is in its nature false .
Parsing [sent. 3438 len. 21]: He may gnaw at it , he may even swallow it , but I deny that he can believe it .
Parsing [sent. 3439 len. 22]: There is not that in it which can be believed ; at most it can but be supposed to be true .
Parsing [sent. 3440 len. 5]: Belief is another thing .
Parsing [sent. 3441 len. 26]: Truth is alone the correlate of belief , just as air is for the lungs , just as form and colour are for the sight .
Parsing [sent. 3442 len. 14]: A lie can no more be believed than carbonic acid can be breathed .
Parsing [sent. 3443 len. 32]: It goes into the lungs , true , and a lie goes into the mind , but both kill ; the one is not BREATHED , the other is not BELIEVED .
Parsing [sent. 3444 len. 53]: The thing that is not true can not find its way to the home of faith ; if it could , it would be at once rejected with a loathing beyond utterance ; to a pure soul , which alone can believe , nothing is so loathsome as a pretence of truth .
Parsing [sent. 3445 len. 7]: A lie is a pretended truth .
Parsing [sent. 3446 len. 11]: If there were no truth there could be no lie .
Parsing [sent. 3447 len. 22]: As the devil upon God , the very being of a lie depends on that whose opposite and enemy it is .
Parsing [sent. 3448 len. 16]: But tell me , Alister , do you believe the parables of our Lord ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3449 len. 7]: `` With all my heart . ''
Parsing [sent. 3450 len. 22]: `` Was there any real person in our Lord 's mind when he told that one about the unjust judge ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3451 len. 16]: `` I do not suppose there was ; but there were doubtless many such . ''
Parsing [sent. 3452 len. 15]: `` Many who would listen to a poor woman because she plagued them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3453 len. 24]: `` Well , it does not matter ; what the story teaches is true , and that was what he wanted believed . ''
Parsing [sent. 3454 len. 4]: `` Just so .
Parsing [sent. 3455 len. 31]: The truth in the parables is what they mean , not what they say ; and so it is , I think , with Rob of the Angels ' stories .
Parsing [sent. 3456 len. 10]: He believes all that can be believed of them .
Parsing [sent. 3457 len. 38]: At the same time , to a mind so simple , the spirit of God must have freer entrance than to ours -- perhaps even teaches the man by what we call THE MAN 'S OWN WORDS .
Parsing [sent. 3458 len. 21]: His words may go before his ideas -- his higher ideas at least -- his ideas follow after his words .
Parsing [sent. 3459 len. 33]: As the half-thoughts pass through his mind -- who can say how much generated by himself , how much directly suggested by the eternal thought in which his spirit lives and breathes !
Parsing [sent. 3460 len. 7]: -- he drinks and is refreshed .
Parsing [sent. 3461 len. 76]: I am convinced that nowhere so much as in the highest knowledge of all -- what the people above count knowledge -- will the fulfilment of the saying of our Lord , `` Many first shall be last , and the last first , '' cause astonishment ; that a man who has been leader of the age 's opinion , may be immeasurably behind another whom he would have shut up in a mad-house .
Parsing [sent. 3462 len. 35]: Depend upon it , things go on in the soul of that Rob of the Angels which the angels , whether they come to talk with him or not , would gladly look into .
Parsing [sent. 3463 len. 14]: Of such as he the angels may one day be the pupils . ''
Parsing [sent. 3464 len. 4]: A silence followed .
Parsing [sent. 3465 len. 21]: `` Do you think the young ladies of the New House could understand Rob of the Angels , Ian ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3466 len. 5]: at length asked Alister .
Parsing [sent. 3467 len. 5]: `` Not a bit .
Parsing [sent. 3468 len. 11]: I tried the younger , and she is the best .
Parsing [sent. 3469 len. 10]: -- They could if they would wake up . ''
Parsing [sent. 3470 len. 9]: `` You might say that of anybody ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3471 len. 58]: `` Yes ; but there is this among other differences -- that some people do not wake up , because they want a new brain first , such as they will get when they die , perhaps ; while others do not wake up , because their whole education has been a rocking of them to sleep .
Parsing [sent. 3472 len. 23]: And there is this difference between the girls , that the one is full of herself , and the other is not .
Parsing [sent. 3473 len. 13]: The one has a close , the other an open mind . ''
Parsing [sent. 3474 len. 36]: `` And yet , '' said Alister , `` if they heard you say so , the open mind would imagine itself the close , and the close never doubt it was the open ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3475 len. 7]: CHAPTER III AT THE NEW HOUSE .
Parsing [sent. 3476 len. 42]: The ladies of the New House were not a little surprised the next day when , as they sat waiting their guests , the door of the drawing-room opened , and they saw the young highlanders enter in ordinary evening dress .
Parsing [sent. 3477 len. 15]: The plough-driving laird himself looked to Christina very much like her patterns of Grosvenor-square .
Parsing [sent. 3478 len. 43]: It was long since he had worn his dress-coat , and it was certainly a little small for his more fully developed frame , but he carried himself as straight as a rush , and was nowise embarrassed with hands or feet .
Parsing [sent. 3479 len. 26]: His hands were brown and large , but they were well shaped , and not ashamed of themselves , being as clean as his heart .
Parsing [sent. 3480 len. 34]: Out of his hazel eyes , looking in the candle-light nearly as dark as Mercy 's , went an occasional glance which an emergency might at once develop into a look of command .
Parsing [sent. 3481 len. 64]: For Ian , he would have attracted attention anywhere , if only from his look of quiet UNSELFNESS , and the invariable grace of the movement that broke his marked repose ; but his entertainers would doubtless have honoured him more had they understood that his manner was just the same and himself as much at home in the grandest court of Europe .
Parsing [sent. 3482 len. 9]: The elder ladies got on together pretty well .
Parsing [sent. 3483 len. 91]: The widow of the chief tried to explain to her hostess the condition of the country and its people ; the latter , though knowing little and caring less about relations beyond those of the family and social circle , nor feeling any purely human responsibility , was yet interested enough to be able to seem more interested than she was ; while her sweet smile and sweet manners were very pleasing to one who seldom now had the opportunity of meeting a woman so much on her own level .
Parsing [sent. 3484 len. 10]: The gentlemen , too , were tolerably comfortable together .
Parsing [sent. 3485 len. 11]: Both Alister and Ian had plenty of talk and anecdote .
Parsing [sent. 3486 len. 30]: The latter pleased the ladies with descriptions of northern ways and dresses and manners -- perhaps yet more with what pleased the men also , tales of wolf-and bear-shooting .
Parsing [sent. 3487 len. 26]: But it seemed odd that , when the talk turned upon the home-shooting called sport , both Alister and Ian should sit in unsmiling silence .
Parsing [sent. 3488 len. 26]: There was in Ian a certain playfulness , a subdued merriment , which made Mercy doubt her ears after his seriousness of the night before .
Parsing [sent. 3489 len. 26]: Life seemed to flash from him on all sides , occasionally in a keen stroke of wit , oftener in a humorous presentation of things .
Parsing [sent. 3490 len. 20]: His brother alone could see how he would check the witticism on his very lips lest it should hurt .
Parsing [sent. 3491 len. 34]: It was in virtue of his tenderness toward everything that had life that he was able to give such narratives of what he had seen , such descriptions of persons he had met .
Parsing [sent. 3492 len. 48]: When he told a story , it was with such quiet participation , manifest in the gleam of his gray eyes , in the smile that hovered like the very soul of Psyche about his lips , that his hearers enjoyed the telling more than the tale .
Parsing [sent. 3493 len. 15]: Even the chief listened with eagerness to every word that fell from his brother .
Parsing [sent. 3494 len. 44]: The ladies took note that , while the manners of the laird and his mother were in a measure old-fashioned , those of Ian were of the latest : with social custom , in its flow of change , he seemed at home .
Parsing [sent. 3495 len. 43]: But his ease never for a moment degenerated into the free-and-easy , the dry rot of manners ; there was a stateliness in him that dominated the ease , and a courtesy that would not permit frendliness to fall into premature familiarity .
Parsing [sent. 3496 len. 19]: He was at ease with his fellows because he respected them , and courteous because he loved them .
Parsing [sent. 3497 len. 23]: The ladies withdrew , and with their departure came the time that tests the man whether he be in truth a gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 3498 len. 21]: In the presence of women the polish that is not revelation but concealment preserves itself only to vanish with them .
Parsing [sent. 3499 len. 23]: How would not some women stand aghast to hear but a specimen of the talk of their heroes at such a time !
Parsing [sent. 3500 len. 24]: It had been remarked throughout the dinner that the highlanders took no wine ; but it was supposed they were reserving their powers .
Parsing [sent. 3501 len. 26]: When they now passed decanter and bottle and jug without filling their glasses , it gave offence to the very soul of Mr. Peregrine Palmer .
Parsing [sent. 3502 len. 76]: The bettered custom of the present day had not then made progress enough to affect his table ; he was not only fond of a glass of good wine , but had the ambition of the cellar largely developed ; he would fain be held a connaisseur in wines , and kept up a good stock of distinguished vintages , from which he had brought of such to Glenruadh as would best bear the carriage .
Parsing [sent. 3503 len. 28]: Having no aspiration , there was room in him for any number of petty ambitions ; and it vexed him not to reap the harvest of recognition .
Parsing [sent. 3504 len. 20]: `` But of course , '' he said to himself , `` no highlander understands anything but whisky ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3505 len. 13]: `` You do n't mean you 're a teetotaler , Macruadh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3506 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 3507 len. 24]: `` No , '' answered the chief ; `` I do not call myself one ; but I never drink anything strong . ''
Parsing [sent. 3508 len. 5]: `` Not on Christmas-day ?
Parsing [sent. 3509 len. 25]: Of course you make an exception at times ; and if at any time , why not on the merriest day of the year ?
Parsing [sent. 3510 len. 7]: You are under no pledge ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3511 len. 25]: `` If that were a reason , '' returned Alister , laughing , `` it would rather be one for becoming pledged immediately . ''
Parsing [sent. 3512 len. 7]: `` Well , you surprise me !
Parsing [sent. 3513 len. 4]: And highlanders too !
Parsing [sent. 3514 len. 18]: I thought better of all highlanders ; they have the reputation of good men at the bottle !
Parsing [sent. 3515 len. 16]: You make me sorry to have brought my wine where it meets with no consideration .
Parsing [sent. 3516 len. 21]: -- Mr. Ian , you are a man of the world : you will not refuse to pledge me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3517 len. 7]: `` I must , Mr. Palmer !
Parsing [sent. 3518 len. 41]: The fact is , my brother and I have seen so much evil come of the drinking habits of the country , which always get worse in a time of depression , that we dare not give in to them .
Parsing [sent. 3519 len. 33]: My father , who was clergyman of the parish before he became head of the clan , was of the same mind before us , and brought us up not to drink .
Parsing [sent. 3520 len. 11]: Throughout a whole Siberian winter I kept the rule . ''
Parsing [sent. 3521 len. 9]: `` And got frost-bitten for your pains ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3522 len. 9]: `` And found myself nothing the worse . ''
Parsing [sent. 3523 len. 12]: `` It 's mighty good of you , no doubt ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3524 len. 12]: said the host , with a curl of his shaven lip .
Parsing [sent. 3525 len. 15]: `` You can hardly call that good which does not involve any self-denial ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3526 len. 3]: remarked Alister .
Parsing [sent. 3527 len. 17]: `` Well , '' said Mr. Peregrine Palmer , `` what IS the world coming to ?
Parsing [sent. 3528 len. 11]: All the pith is leaking out of our young men .
Parsing [sent. 3529 len. 14]: In another generation we shall have neither soldiers nor sailors nor statesmen ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3530 len. 12]: `` On what do you found such a sad conclusion ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3531 len. 3]: inquired Ian .
Parsing [sent. 3532 len. 11]: `` On the growth of asceticism in the young men .
Parsing [sent. 3533 len. 46]: Believe me , it is necessary to manhood that men when they are young should drink a little , gamble a little , and sow a few wild oats -- as necessary as that a nation should found itself by the law of the strongest .
Parsing [sent. 3534 len. 13]: How else can we look for the moderation to follow with responsibilities ?
Parsing [sent. 3535 len. 34]: The vices that are more than excusable in the young , are very properly denied to the married man ; the law for him is not the same as for the young man .
Parsing [sent. 3536 len. 22]: I do not plead for license , you see ; but it will never do for young men to turn ascetics !
Parsing [sent. 3537 len. 26]: Let the clergy do as they please ; they are hardly to be counted men ; at least their calling is not a manly one !
Parsing [sent. 3538 len. 32]: Depend upon it , young men who do not follow the dictates of nature -- while they are young , I mean -- will never make any mark in the world !
Parsing [sent. 3539 len. 25]: They dry up like a nut , brain and all , and have neither spirit , nor wit , nor force of any kind .
Parsing [sent. 3540 len. 4]: Nature knows best !
Parsing [sent. 3541 len. 22]: When I was a young man , -- '' `` Pray spare us confession , Mr. Palmer , '' said Ian .
Parsing [sent. 3542 len. 33]: `` In our case your doctrine does not enter willing ears , and I should be sorry anything we might feel compelled to say , should have the appearance of personality . ''
Parsing [sent. 3543 len. 12]: `` Do you suppose I should heed anything you said ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3544 len. 12]: cried the host , betraying the bad blood in his breeding .
Parsing [sent. 3545 len. 18]: `` Is it manners here to prevent a man from speaking his mind at his own table ?
Parsing [sent. 3546 len. 9]: I say a saint is not a man !
Parsing [sent. 3547 len. 27]: A fellow that will neither look at a woman nor drink his glass , is not cut out for man 's work in the world ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3548 len. 20]: Like a sledge-hammer came the fist of the laird on the table , that the crystal danced and rang .
Parsing [sent. 3549 len. 5]: `` My God ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3550 len. 9]: he exclaimed , and rose in hugest indignation .
Parsing [sent. 3551 len. 14]: Ian laid his hand on his arm , and he sat down again .
Parsing [sent. 3552 len. 20]: `` There may be some misunderstanding , Alister , '' said Ian , `` between us and our host !
Parsing [sent. 3553 len. 25]: -- Pray , Mr. Palmer , let us understand each other : do you believe God made woman to be the slave of man ?
Parsing [sent. 3554 len. 14]: Can you believe he ever made a woman that she might be dishonoured ?
Parsing [sent. 3555 len. 11]: -- that a man might caress and despise her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3556 len. 24]: `` I know nothing about God 's intentions ; all I say is , we must obey the laws of our nature . ''
Parsing [sent. 3557 len. 11]: `` Is conscience then not a law of our nature ?
Parsing [sent. 3558 len. 10]: Or is it below the level of our instincts ?
Parsing [sent. 3559 len. 11]: Must not the lower laws be subject to the higher ?
Parsing [sent. 3560 len. 31]: It is a law -- for ever broken , yet eternal -- that a man is his brother 's keeper : still more must he be his sister 's keeper .
Parsing [sent. 3561 len. 15]: Therein is involved all civilization , all national as well as individual growth . ''
Parsing [sent. 3562 len. 8]: Mr. Peregrine Palmer smiled a contemptuous smile .
Parsing [sent. 3563 len. 20]: The other young men exchanged glances that seemed to say , `` The governor knows what 's what ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3564 len. 39]: `` Such may be the popular feeling in this out-of-the-way spot , '' said Mr. Peregrine Palmer , `` and no doubt it is very praiseworthy , but the world is not of your opinion , gentlemen . ''
Parsing [sent. 3565 len. 29]: `` The world has got to come to our opinion , '' said the laird -- at which the young men of the house broke into a laugh .
Parsing [sent. 3566 len. 8]: `` May we join the ladies ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3567 len. 5]: said Ian , rising .
Parsing [sent. 3568 len. 28]: `` By all means , '' answered the host , with a laugh meant to be good-humoured ; `` they are the fittest company for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3569 len. 48]: As the brothers went up the stair , they heard their host again holding forth ; but they would not have been much edified by the slight change of front he had made -- to impress on the young men the necessity of moderation in their pleasures .
Parsing [sent. 3570 len. 44]: There are two opposite classes related by a like unbelief -- those who will not believe in the existence of the good of which they have apprehended no approximate instance , and those who will not believe in the existence of similar evil .
Parsing [sent. 3571 len. 45]: I tell the one class , there are men who would cast their very being from them rather than be such as they ; and the other , that their shutting of their eyes is no potent reason for the shutting of my mouth .
Parsing [sent. 3572 len. 34]: There are multitudes delicate as they , who are compelled to meet evil face to face , and fight with it the sternest of battles : on their side may I be found !
Parsing [sent. 3573 len. 19]: What the Lord knew and recognized , I will know and recognize too , be shocked who may .
Parsing [sent. 3574 len. 15]: I spare them , however , any more of the talk at that dinner-table .
Parsing [sent. 3575 len. 14]: Only let them take heed lest their refinement involve a very bad selfishness .
Parsing [sent. 3576 len. 9]: Cursed be the evil thing , not ignored !
Parsing [sent. 3577 len. 18]: Mrs. Palmer , sweet-smiled and clear-eyed , never showed the least indignation at her husband 's doctrines .
Parsing [sent. 3578 len. 12]: I fear she was devoid of indignation on behalf of others .
Parsing [sent. 3579 len. 15]: Very far are such from understanding the ways of the all-pardoning , all-punishing Father !
Parsing [sent. 3580 len. 20]: The three from the cottage were half-way home ere the gentlemen of the New House rose from their wine .
Parsing [sent. 3581 len. 15]: Then first the mother sought an explanation of the early departure they had suggested .
Parsing [sent. 3582 len. 14]: `` Something went wrong , sons : what was it she said ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3583 len. 19]: `` I do n't like the men , mother ; nor does Ian , '' answered Alister gloomily .
Parsing [sent. 3584 len. 9]: `` Take care you are not unjust ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3585 len. 3]: she replied .
Parsing [sent. 3586 len. 19]: `` You would not have liked Mr. Palmer 's doctrine any better than we did , mother . ''
Parsing [sent. 3587 len. 6]: `` What was it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3588 len. 9]: `` We would rather not tell you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3589 len. 12]: `` It was not fit for a woman to hear . ''
Parsing [sent. 3590 len. 7]: `` Then do not tell me .
Parsing [sent. 3591 len. 8]: I trust you to defend women . ''
Parsing [sent. 3592 len. 9]: `` In God 's name we will ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3593 len. 3]: said Alister .
Parsing [sent. 3594 len. 12]: `` There is no occasion for an oath , Alister ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3595 len. 4]: said his mother .
Parsing [sent. 3596 len. 8]: `` Alister meant it very solemnly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3597 len. 3]: said Ian .
Parsing [sent. 3598 len. 15]: `` Yes ; but it was not necessary -- least of all to me .
Parsing [sent. 3599 len. 33]: The name of our Lord God should lie a precious jewel in the cabinet of our hearts , to be taken out only at great times , and with loving awe . ''
Parsing [sent. 3600 len. 34]: `` I shall be careful , mother , '' answered Alister ; `` but when things make me sorry , or glad , or angry , I always think of God first ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3601 len. 17]: `` I understand you ; but I fear taking the name of God in vain . ''
Parsing [sent. 3602 len. 11]: `` It shall not be in vain , mother ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3603 len. 4]: said the laird .
Parsing [sent. 3604 len. 12]: `` Must it be a breach with our new neighbours ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3605 len. 4]: asked the mother .
Parsing [sent. 3606 len. 7]: `` It will depend on them .
Parsing [sent. 3607 len. 12]: The thing began because we would not drink with them . ''
Parsing [sent. 3608 len. 9]: `` You did not make any remark ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3609 len. 12]: `` Not until our host 's remarks called for our reasons .
Parsing [sent. 3610 len. 17]: By the way , I should like to know how the man made his money . ''
Parsing [sent. 3611 len. 3]: CHAPTER IV .
Parsing [sent. 3612 len. 3]: THE BROTHERS .
Parsing [sent. 3613 len. 29]: Events , then , because of the deeper things whence they came , seemed sorely against any cordial approach of the old and the new houses of Glenruadh .
Parsing [sent. 3614 len. 114]: But there was a sacred enemy within the stronghold of Mr. Peregrine Palmer , and that enemy forbade him to break with the young highlanders notwithstanding the downright mode in which they had expressed their difference with him : he felt , without knowing it , ashamed of the things he had uttered ; they were not such as he would wish proclaimed from the house-tops out of the midst of which rose heavenward the spire of the church he had built ; neither did the fact that he would have no man be wicked on Sundays , make him feel quite right in urging young men to their swing on other days .
Parsing [sent. 3615 len. 31]: Christian and Sercombe could not but admire the straightforwardness of the brothers ; their conventionality could not prevent them from feeling the dignity with which they acted on their convictions .
Parsing [sent. 3616 len. 13]: The quixotic young fellows ought not to be cut for their behaviour !
Parsing [sent. 3617 len. 14]: They could not court their society , but would treat them with consideration !
Parsing [sent. 3618 len. 12]: Things could not well happen to bring them into much proximity !
Parsing [sent. 3619 len. 20]: What had taken place could not definitely influence the ideas , feelings , or opinions of the young ladies .
Parsing [sent. 3620 len. 25]: Their father would sooner have had his hand cut off than any word said over that fuliginous dessert reach the ears of his daughters .
Parsing [sent. 3621 len. 30]: Is it not an absolute damnation of certain evil principles , that many men would be flayed alive rather than let those they love know that they hold them ?
Parsing [sent. 3622 len. 36]: But see the selfishness of such men : each looks with scorn on the woman he has done his part to degrade , but not an impure breath must reach the ears of HIS children !
Parsing [sent. 3623 len. 10]: Another man 's he will send to the devil !
Parsing [sent. 3624 len. 51]: Mr. Palmer did , however , communicate something of the conversation to his wife ; and although she had neither the spirit , nor the insight , nor the active purity , to tell him he was in the wrong , she did not like the young highlanders the worse .
Parsing [sent. 3625 len. 22]: She even thought it a pity the world should have been so made that they could not be in the right .
Parsing [sent. 3626 len. 65]: It is wonderful how a bird of the air will carry a matter , and some vaguest impression of what had occurred alighted on the minds of the elder girls -- possibly from hints supposed unintelligible , passing between Mr. Sercombe and Christian : something in the social opinions of the two highlanders made those opinions differ much from the opinions prevailing in society !
Parsing [sent. 3627 len. 49]: Now even Mercy had not escaped some notion of things of which the air about her was full ; and she felt the glow of a conscious attraction towards men -- somehow , she did not know how -- like old-fashioned knights errant in their relations to women .
Parsing [sent. 3628 len. 13]: The attachment between the brothers was unusual both in kind and degree .
Parsing [sent. 3629 len. 44]: Alister regarded Ian as his better self , through whom to rise above himself ; Ian looked up to his brother as the head of the family , uniting in himself all ancestral claims , the representative of an ordered and harmonious commonwealth .
Parsing [sent. 3630 len. 14]: He saw in Alister virtues and powers he did not recognize in himself .
Parsing [sent. 3631 len. 30]: His love blossomed into the deeper devotion that he only had been sent to college : he was bound to share with his elder brother what he had learned .
Parsing [sent. 3632 len. 19]: So Alister got more through Ian than he would have got at the best college in the world .
Parsing [sent. 3633 len. 40]: For Ian was a born teacher , and found intensest delight , not in imparting knowledge -- that is a comparatively poor thing -- but in leading a mind up to see what it was before incapable of seeing .
Parsing [sent. 3634 len. 17]: It was part of the same gift that he always knew when he had not succeeded .
Parsing [sent. 3635 len. 21]: In Alister he found a wonderful docility -- crossed indeed with a great pride , against which he fought sturdily .
Parsing [sent. 3636 len. 53]: It is not a good sign of any age that it should find it hard to believe in such simplicity and purity as that of these young men ; it is perhaps even a worse sign of our own that we should find it difficult to believe in such love between men .
Parsing [sent. 3637 len. 34]: I am sure of this , that a man incapable of loving another man with hearty devotion , can not be capable of loving a woman as a woman ought to be loved .
Parsing [sent. 3638 len. 10]: From each other these two kept positively nothing secret .
Parsing [sent. 3639 len. 57]: Alister had a great love of music , which however had had little development except from the study of the violin , with the assistance of a certain poor enough performer in the village , and what criticism his brother could afford him , who , not himself a player , had heard much good music .
Parsing [sent. 3640 len. 19]: But Alister was sorely hampered by the fact that his mother could not bear the sound of it .
Parsing [sent. 3641 len. 70]: The late chief was one of the few clergymen who played the violin ; and at the first wail of the old instrument in the hands of his son , his widow was seized with such a passion of weeping , that Alister took the utmost care she should never hear it again , always carrying it to some place too remote for the farthest-travelling tones to reach her .
Parsing [sent. 3642 len. 16]: But this was not easy , for sound will travel very far among the hills .
Parsing [sent. 3643 len. 48]: At times he would take it to the room behind Annie 's shop , at times to the hut occupied by Hector of the Stags : there he would not excruciate his host at least , and Rob of the Angels would endure anything for his chief .
Parsing [sent. 3644 len. 42]: The place which he most preferred was too distant to be often visited ; but there , soon after Christmas , the brothers now resolved to have a day together , a long talk , and a conference with the violin .
Parsing [sent. 3645 len. 19]: On a clear frosty morning in January they set out , provided for a night and two days .
Parsing [sent. 3646 len. 32]: The place was upon an upland pasture-ground , yet in their possession : no farm was complete without a range in some high valley for the sheep and cattle in summer .
Parsing [sent. 3647 len. 26]: On the north of this valley stood a bare hilltop , whose crest was a limestone rock , rising from the heather about twenty feet .
Parsing [sent. 3648 len. 48]: Every summer they had spent weeks of their boyhood with the shepherds , in the society of this hill , and one day discovered in its crest a shallow cave , to which thereafter they often took their food , and the book they were reading together .
Parsing [sent. 3649 len. 32]: There they read the English Ossian , troubled by no ignorant unbelief ; and there they made Gaelic songs , in which Alister excelled , while Ian did better in English .
Parsing [sent. 3650 len. 20]: When Ian was at home in the university-vacations , they were fonder than ever of going to the hill .
Parsing [sent. 3651 len. 27]: There Ian would pour out to Alister of the fullness of his gathered knowledge , and there and then they made their first acquaintance with Shakspere .
Parsing [sent. 3652 len. 33]: Ian had bought some dozen of his plays , in smallest compass and cleanest type , at a penny a piece , and how they revelled in them the long summer evenings !
Parsing [sent. 3653 len. 41]: Ian had bought also , in a small thick volume , the poems of Shelley : these gave them not only large delight , but much to talk about , for they were quite capable of encountering his vague philosophy .
Parsing [sent. 3654 len. 30]: Then they had their Euclid and Virgil -- and even tried their mental teeth upon Dante , but found the Commedia without notes too hard a nut for them .
Parsing [sent. 3655 len. 19]: Every fresh spring , Ian brought with him fresh books , and these they read in their cave .
Parsing [sent. 3656 len. 19]: But I must not forget the cave itself , which also shared in the progress of its troglodytes .
Parsing [sent. 3657 len. 29]: The same week in which they first ate and read in it , they conceived and began to embody the idea of developing the hollow into a house .
Parsing [sent. 3658 len. 65]: Foraging long ago in their father 's library for mental pabulum , they had come upon Belzoni 's quarto , and had read , with the avidity of imaginative boys , the tale of his discoveries , taking especial delight in his explorations of the tombs of the kings in the rocks of Beban el Malook : these it was that now suggested excavation .
Parsing [sent. 3659 len. 20]: They found serviceable tools about the place at home , and the rock was not quite of the hardest .
Parsing [sent. 3660 len. 36]: Not a summer , for the last seventeen years , had passed without a good deal being done , Alister working alone when Ian was away , and the cave had now assumed notable dimensions .
Parsing [sent. 3661 len. 23]: It was called by the people uamh an ceann , the cave of the chief , and regarded as his country house .
Parsing [sent. 3662 len. 49]: All around it was covered with snow throughout the winter and spring , and supplied little to the need of man beyond the blessed air , and a glorious vision of sea and land , mountain and valley , falling water , gleaming lake , and shadowy cliff .
Parsing [sent. 3663 len. 34]: Crossing the wide space where so lately they had burned the heather that the sheep might have its young shoots in the spring , the brothers stood , and gazed around with delight .
Parsing [sent. 3664 len. 9]: `` There is nothing like this anywhere ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3665 len. 3]: said Ian .
Parsing [sent. 3666 len. 9]: `` Do you mean nothing so beautiful ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3667 len. 3]: asked Alister .
Parsing [sent. 3668 len. 16]: `` No ; I mean just what I say : there is nothing like it .
Parsing [sent. 3669 len. 31]: I do not care a straw whether one scene be more or less beautiful than another ; what I do care for is -- its individual speech to my soul .
Parsing [sent. 3670 len. 10]: I feel towards visions of nature as towards writers .
Parsing [sent. 3671 len. 30]: If a book or a prospect produces in my mind a mood that no other produces , then I feel it individual , original , real , therefore precious .
Parsing [sent. 3672 len. 32]: If a scene or a song play upon the organ of my heart as no other scene or song could , why should I ask at all whether it be beautiful ?
Parsing [sent. 3673 len. 20]: A bare hill may be more to me than a garden of Damascus , but I love them both .
Parsing [sent. 3674 len. 31]: The first question as to any work of art is whether it puts the willing soul into any mood at all peculiar ; the second , what that mood is .
Parsing [sent. 3675 len. 56]: It matters to me little by whom our Ossian was composed , and it matters nothing whoever may in his ignorance declare that there never was an Ossian any more than a Homer : here is a something that has power over my heart and soul , works upon them as not anything else does .
Parsing [sent. 3676 len. 47]: I do not ask whether its power be great or small ; it is enough that it is a peculiar power , one by itself ; that it puts my spiritual consciousness in a certain individual condition , such in character as nothing else can occasion .
Parsing [sent. 3677 len. 16]: Either a man or a nation must have felt to make me so feel . ''
Parsing [sent. 3678 len. 24]: They were now climbing the last slope of the hill on whose top stood their playhouse , dearer now than in their boyhood .
Parsing [sent. 3679 len. 34]: Alister occasionally went there for a few hours ' solitude , and Ian would write there for days at a time , but in general when they visited the place it was together .
Parsing [sent. 3680 len. 8]: Alister unlocked the door and they entered .
Parsing [sent. 3681 len. 25]: Unwilling to spend labour on the introductory , they had made the first chamber hardly larger than the room required for opening the door .
Parsing [sent. 3682 len. 21]: Immediately within , another door opened into a room of about eight feet by twelve , with two small windows .
Parsing [sent. 3683 len. 28]: Its hearth was a projection from the floor of the live stone ; and there , all ready for lighting , was a large pile of peats .
Parsing [sent. 3684 len. 19]: The chimney went up through the rock , and had been the most difficult part of their undertaking .
Parsing [sent. 3685 len. 25]: They had to work it much wider than was necessary for the smoke , and then to reduce its capacity with stone and lime .
Parsing [sent. 3686 len. 11]: Now and then it smoked , but peat-smoke is sweet .
Parsing [sent. 3687 len. 31]: The first thing after lighting the fire , was to fill their kettle , for which they had to take off the snow-lid of a small spring near at hand .
Parsing [sent. 3688 len. 15]: Then they made a good meal of tea , mutton-ham , oatcakes and butter .
Parsing [sent. 3689 len. 33]: The only seats in the room were a bench in each of two of the walls , and a chair on each side of the hearth , all of the live rock .
Parsing [sent. 3690 len. 23]: From this opened two rooms more -- one a bedroom , with a bed in the rock-wall , big enough for two .
Parsing [sent. 3691 len. 11]: Dry heather stood thick between the mattress and the stone .
Parsing [sent. 3692 len. 40]: The third room , of which they intended making a parlour , was not yet more than half excavated ; and there , when they had rested a while , they began to bore and chip at the stone .
Parsing [sent. 3693 len. 28]: Their progress was slow , for the grain was close : never , even when the snow above was melting , had the least moisture come through .
Parsing [sent. 3694 len. 16]: For a time they worked and talked : both talked better when using their hands .
Parsing [sent. 3695 len. 31]: Then Alister stopped , and played while Ian went on ; Ian stopped next , and read aloud from a manuscript he had brought , while his brother again worked .
Parsing [sent. 3696 len. 15]: But first he gave Alister the history of what he was going to read .
Parsing [sent. 3697 len. 43]: It was suggested , he said , by that strange poem of William Mayne 's , called `` The Dead Man 's Moan , '' founded on the silly notion that the man himself is buried , and not merely his body .
Parsing [sent. 3698 len. 43]: `` I wish I were up to straught my banes , And drive frae my face the cauld , dead air ; I wish I were up , that the friendly rains Micht wash the dark mould frae my tangled hair ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3699 len. 27]: quoted Ian , and added , `` I thought I should like to follow out the idea , and see what ought to come of it .
Parsing [sent. 3700 len. 34]: I therefore supposed a person seized by something of the cataleptic kind , from which he comes to himself still in the body , but unable to hold communication with the outer world .
Parsing [sent. 3701 len. 10]: He thinks therefore that he is dead and buried .
Parsing [sent. 3702 len. 42]: Recovering from his first horror , he reflects that , as he did not make himself think and feel , nor can cease to think and feel if he would , there must be somewhere -- and where but within himself ?
Parsing [sent. 3703 len. 35]: -- the power by which he thinks and feels , a power whose care it must be , for it can belong to no other , to look after the creature he has made .
Parsing [sent. 3704 len. 27]: Then comes to him the prayer of Job , ` Oh that thou wouldst hide me in the grave till thy anger with me was past !
Parsing [sent. 3705 len. 19]: Then wouldst thou desire to see again the work of thy hands , the creature thou hadst made !
Parsing [sent. 3706 len. 11]: Then wouldst thou call , and I would answer . '
Parsing [sent. 3707 len. 24]: So grandly is the man comforted thereby , that he breaks out in a dumb song of triumph over death and the grave .
Parsing [sent. 3708 len. 15]: As its last tone dies in him , a kiss falls upon his lips .
Parsing [sent. 3709 len. 34]: It is the farewell of the earth ; the same moment he bursts the bonds and rises above the clouds of the body , and enters into the joy of his Lord . ''
Parsing [sent. 3710 len. 27]: Having thus prepared Alister to hear without having to think as well as attend , which is not good for poetry , Ian read his verses .
Parsing [sent. 3711 len. 24]: I will not trouble my reader with them ; I am sure he would not think so well of them as did Alister .
Parsing [sent. 3712 len. 16]: What Ian desired was sympathy , not admiration , but from Alister he had both .
Parsing [sent. 3713 len. 29]: Few men would care to hear the talk of those two , for they had no interest in anything that did not belong to the reality of things .
Parsing [sent. 3714 len. 14]: To them the things most men count real , were the merest phantasms .
Parsing [sent. 3715 len. 14]: They sought what would not merely last , but must go on growing .
Parsing [sent. 3716 len. 23]: At strife with all their known selfishness , they were growing into strife with all the selfishness in them as yet unknown .
Parsing [sent. 3717 len. 31]: There was for them no question of choice ; they MUST choose what was true ; they MUST choose life ; they MUST NOT walk in the way of death .
Parsing [sent. 3718 len. 12]: They were very near to agreeing about EVERYthing they should ask .
Parsing [sent. 3719 len. 31]: Few men are capable of understanding such love as theirs , of understanding the love of David and Jonathan , of Shakspere to W. H. , of Tennyson and Hallam .
Parsing [sent. 3720 len. 33]: Every such love , nevertheless , is a possession of the race ; what has once been is , in possibility to come , as well as in fact that has come .
Parsing [sent. 3721 len. 18]: A solitary instance of anything great is enough to prove it human , yea necessary to humanity .
Parsing [sent. 3722 len. 65]: I have wondered whether the man in whom such love is possible , may not spring of an altogether happy conjunction of male and female -- a father and mother who not only loved each other , but were of the same mind in high things , of the same lofty aims in life , so that their progeny came of their true man-and-woman-hood .
Parsing [sent. 3723 len. 29]: If any unaccountable disruption or discord of soul appear in a man , it is worth while to ask whether his father and mother were of one aspiration .
Parsing [sent. 3724 len. 42]: Might not the fact that their marriage did not go deep enough , that father and mother were not of one mind , only of one body , serve to account for the rude results of some marriages of personable people ?
Parsing [sent. 3725 len. 16]: At the same time we must not forget the endless and unfathomable perpetuations of ancestry .
Parsing [sent. 3726 len. 19]: But however these things may be , those two men , brothers born , were also brothers willed .
Parsing [sent. 3727 len. 11]: They ceased quarrying , and returned to the outer room .
Parsing [sent. 3728 len. 22]: Ian betook himself to drawing figures on one of the walls , with the intention of carving them in dipped relief .
Parsing [sent. 3729 len. 17]: Alister proceeded to take their bedding from before the fire , and prepare for the night .
Parsing [sent. 3730 len. 3]: CHAPTER V .
Parsing [sent. 3731 len. 3]: THE PRINCESS .
Parsing [sent. 3732 len. 41]: While they were thus busied , Ian , with his face to the wall , in the dim light of the candle by which he was making his first rough sketches , began the story of his flight from Russia .
Parsing [sent. 3733 len. 29]: Long ere he ended , Alister came close behind him , and there stood , his bosom heaving with emotion , his eyes burning with a dry fire .
Parsing [sent. 3734 len. 11]: Ian was perfectly composed , his voice quiet and low .
Parsing [sent. 3735 len. 29]: I will not give his tale in the first person ; and will tell of it only as much as I think it necessary my reader should know .
Parsing [sent. 3736 len. 20]: Having accepted a commission of the Czar , he was placed in a post of trust in the palace .
Parsing [sent. 3737 len. 24]: In one apartment of it , lived an imperial princess , the burden of whose rank had not even the alleviation of society .
Parsing [sent. 3738 len. 43]: Her disclosure of a sympathy with oppressed humanity had wakened a doubt as to her politics , and she was virtually a prisoner , restricted to a corner of the huge dwelling , and allowed to see hardly any but her women .
Parsing [sent. 3739 len. 17]: Her father had fallen into disgrace before her , and her mother was dead of grief .
Parsing [sent. 3740 len. 11]: All around her were spies , and love was nowhere .
Parsing [sent. 3741 len. 18]: Gladly would she have yielded every rag of her rank , to breathe the air of freedom .
Parsing [sent. 3742 len. 18]: To be a peasant girl on her father 's land , would be a life of rapture !
Parsing [sent. 3743 len. 12]: She knew little of the solace books might have given her .
Parsing [sent. 3744 len. 57]: With a mind capable of rapid development , she had been ill taught except in music ; and that , alone , can not do much for spiritual development ; it can not enable the longing , the aspiration it rouses , to understand itself ; it can not lead back to its own eternal source .
Parsing [sent. 3745 len. 61]: She knew no one in whom to trust , or from whom to draw comfort ; her confessor was a man of the world , incapable of leading her to any fountain of living water ; she had no one to tell her of God and his fatherhood , the only and perfect refuge from the divine miseries of loneliness .
Parsing [sent. 3746 len. 39]: A great corridor went from end to end of one of the wings of the palace , and from this corridor another passage led toward the apartment of the princess , consisting of some five or six rooms .
Parsing [sent. 3747 len. 31]: At certain times of the day , Ian had to be at the beginning of the corridor , at the head of a huge stair with a spacious hall-like landing .
Parsing [sent. 3748 len. 16]: Along the corridor few passed , for the attendants used a back stair and passages .
Parsing [sent. 3749 len. 46]: As he sat in the recess of a large window , where stood a table and chair for his use , Ian one morning heard a cry -- whence , he never knew -- and darted along the corridor , thinking assistance might be wanted .
Parsing [sent. 3750 len. 22]: When about halfway down , he saw a lady enter , near the end of it , and come slowly along .
Parsing [sent. 3751 len. 11]: He stood aside , respectfully waiting till she should pass .
Parsing [sent. 3752 len. 16]: Her eyes were on the ground , but as she came near she raised them .
Parsing [sent. 3753 len. 16]: The sadness of them went to his heart , and his soul rushed into his .
Parsing [sent. 3754 len. 18]: The princess , I imagine , had never before met such an expression , and misunderstood it .
Parsing [sent. 3755 len. 58]: Lonely , rejected , too helpless even to hope , it seemed full of something she had all her life been longing for -- a soul to be her refuge from the wind , her covert from the tempest , her shadow as of a great rock in the weary land where no one cared for her .
Parsing [sent. 3756 len. 7]: She stood and gazed at him .
Parsing [sent. 3757 len. 19]: Ian at once perceived who she must be , and stood waiting for some expression of her pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 3758 len. 21]: But she appeared fascinated ; her eyes remained on his , for they seemed to her to be promising help .
Parsing [sent. 3759 len. 17]: Her fascination fascinated him , and for some moments they stood thus , regarding each other .
Parsing [sent. 3760 len. 8]: Ian felt he must break the spell .
Parsing [sent. 3761 len. 21]: It was her part to speak , his to obey , but he knew the danger of the smallest suspicion .
Parsing [sent. 3762 len. 30]: If she was a princess and he but a soldier on guard , she was a woman and he was a man : he was there to protect her !
Parsing [sent. 3763 len. 10]: `` How may I serve your imperial highness ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3764 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 3765 len. 15]: She was silent yet a moment , then said , `` Your name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3766 len. 4]: He gave it .
Parsing [sent. 3767 len. 5]: `` Your nation ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3768 len. 4]: He stated it .
Parsing [sent. 3769 len. 7]: `` When are you here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3770 len. 6]: He told her his hours .
Parsing [sent. 3771 len. 17]: `` I will see you again , '' she said , and turned and went back .
Parsing [sent. 3772 len. 13]: From that moment she loved him , and thought he loved her .
Parsing [sent. 3773 len. 20]: But , though he would willingly have died for her , he did not love her as she thought .
Parsing [sent. 3774 len. 8]: Alister wondered to hear him say so .
Parsing [sent. 3775 len. 34]: At such a moment , and heart-free , Alister could no more have helped falling in love with her than he could help opening his eyes when the light shone on their lids .
Parsing [sent. 3776 len. 30]: Ian , with a greater love for his kind than even Alister , and with a tenderness for womankind altogether infinite , was not ready to fall in love .
Parsing [sent. 3777 len. 46]: Accessible indeed he was to the finest of Nature 's witcheries ; ready for the response as of summer lightnings from opposing horizons ; all aware of loveliest difference , of refuge and mysterious complement ; but he was not prone to fall in love .
Parsing [sent. 3778 len. 17]: The princess , knowing the ways of the house , contrived to see him pretty often .
Parsing [sent. 3779 len. 43]: He talked to her of the hest he knew ; he did what he could to lighten her loneliness by finding her books and music ; best of all , he persuaded her -- without difficulty -- to read the New Testament .
Parsing [sent. 3780 len. 60]: In their few minutes of conference , he tried to show her the Master of men as he showed himself to his friends ; but their time together was always so short , and their anxiety for each other so great , seeing that discovery would be ruin to both , that they could not go far with anything .
Parsing [sent. 3781 len. 11]: At length came an occasion when at parting they embraced .
Parsing [sent. 3782 len. 8]: How it was Ian could not tell .
Parsing [sent. 3783 len. 16]: He blamed himself much , but Alister thought it might not have been his fault .
Parsing [sent. 3784 len. 20]: The same moment he was aware that he did not love her and that he could not turn back .
Parsing [sent. 3785 len. 39]: He was ready to do anything , everything in honour ; yet felt false inasmuch as he had given her ground for believing that he felt towards her as he could not help seeing she felt towards him .
Parsing [sent. 3786 len. 26]: Had it been in his power to order his own heart , he would have willed to love , and so would have loved her .
Parsing [sent. 3787 len. 16]: But the princess doubted nothing , and the change that passed upon her was wonderful .
Parsing [sent. 3788 len. 15]: The power of human love is next to the power of Grod 's love .
Parsing [sent. 3789 len. 52]: Like a flower long repressed by cold , she blossomed so suddenly in the sunshine of her bliss , that Ian greatly dreaded the suspicion which the too evident alteration might arouse : the plain , ordinary-looking young woman with fine eyes , began to put on the robes of beauty .
Parsing [sent. 3790 len. 47]: A softest vapour of rose , the colour of the east when sundown sets it dreaming of sunrise , tinged her cheek ; it grew round like that of a girl ; and ere two months were gone , she looked years younger than her age .
Parsing [sent. 3791 len. 60]: But Ian could never be absolutely open with her ; while she , poor princess , happy in her ignorance of the shows of love , and absorbed in the joy of its great deliverance , jealoused nothing of restraint , nothing of lack , either in his words or in the caresses of which he was religiously sparing .
Parsing [sent. 3792 len. 26]: He was haunted by the dread of making her grieve who had already grieved so much , and was but just risen from the dead .
Parsing [sent. 3793 len. 41]: One evening they met as usual in the twilight ; in five minutes the steps of the man would be heard coming to light the lamps of the corridor , his guard would be over , and he must retire .
Parsing [sent. 3794 len. 26]: Few words passed , but they parted with more of lingering tenderness than usual , and the princess put a little packet in his hand .
Parsing [sent. 3795 len. 91]: The same night his only friend in the service entered his room hurriedly , and urged immediate flight : something had been , or was imagined to be discovered , through which his liberty , perhaps his life , was compromised ; he must leave at once by a certain coach which would start in an hour : there was but just time to disguise him ; he must make for a certain port on the Baltic , and there lie concealed until a chance of getting away turned up !
Parsing [sent. 3796 len. 3]: Ian refused .
Parsing [sent. 3797 len. 12]: He feared nothing , had done nothing to be ashamed of !
Parsing [sent. 3798 len. 12]: What was it to him if they did take his life !
Parsing [sent. 3799 len. 8]: he could die as well as another !
Parsing [sent. 3800 len. 18]: Anxious about the princess , he persisted in his refusal , and the coach went without him .
Parsing [sent. 3801 len. 8]: Every passenger in that coach was murdered .
Parsing [sent. 3802 len. 12]: He saw afterward the signs of their fate in the snow .
Parsing [sent. 3803 len. 33]: In the middle of the night , a company of men in masks entered his room , muffled his head , and hurried him into a carriage , which drove rapidly away .
Parsing [sent. 3804 len. 27]: When it stopped , he thought he had arrived at some prison , but soon found himself in another carriage , with two of the police .
Parsing [sent. 3805 len. 28]: He could have escaped had he been so minded , but he could do nothing for the princess , and did not care what became of him .
Parsing [sent. 3806 len. 35]: At a certain town his attendants left him , with the assurance that if he did not make haste out of the country , he would find they had not lost sight of him .
Parsing [sent. 3807 len. 21]: But instead of obeying , he disguised himself , and took his way to Moscow , where he had friends .
Parsing [sent. 3808 len. 10]: Thence he wrote to his friend at St. Petersburg .
Parsing [sent. 3809 len. 13]: Not many letters passed ere he learned that the princess was dead .
Parsing [sent. 3810 len. 24]: She had been placed in closer confinement , her health gave way , and by a rapid decline she had gained her freedom .
Parsing [sent. 3811 len. 26]: All the night through , not closing their eyes till the morning , the brothers , with many intervals of thoughtful silence , lay talking .
Parsing [sent. 3812 len. 39]: `` I am glad to think , '' said Alister , after one of these silences , `` you do not suffer so much , Ian , as if you had been downright in love with her . ''
Parsing [sent. 3813 len. 21]: `` I suffer far more , '' answered Ian with a sigh ; `` and I ought to suffer more .
Parsing [sent. 3814 len. 20]: It breaks my heart to think she had not so much from me as she thought she had . ''
Parsing [sent. 3815 len. 6]: They were once more silent .
Parsing [sent. 3816 len. 9]: Alister was full of trouble for his brother .
Parsing [sent. 3817 len. 6]: Ian at length spoke again .
Parsing [sent. 3818 len. 14]: `` Alister , '' he said , `` I must tell you everything !
Parsing [sent. 3819 len. 6]: I know the truth now .
Parsing [sent. 3820 len. 12]: If I wronged her , she is having her revenge ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3821 len. 14]: By his tone Alister seemed through the darkness to see his sad smile .
Parsing [sent. 3822 len. 8]: He was silent , and Alister waited .
Parsing [sent. 3823 len. 11]: `` She did not know much , '' Ian resumed .
Parsing [sent. 3824 len. 65]: `` I thought at first she had nothing but good manners and a good heart ; but the moment the sun of another heart began to shine on her , the air of another 's thought to breathe upon her , the room of another soul to surround her , she began to grow ; and what more could God intend or man desire ?
Parsing [sent. 3825 len. 20]: As I told you , she grew beautiful , and what sign of life is equal to that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3826 len. 18]: `` But I want to know what you mean by her having her revenge on you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3827 len. 3]: said Alister .
Parsing [sent. 3828 len. 23]: `` Whether I loved her then or not , and I believe I did , beyond a doubt I love her now .
Parsing [sent. 3829 len. 28]: It needed only to be out of sight of her , and see other women beside the memory of her , to know that I loved her .
Parsing [sent. 3830 len. 8]: -- Alister , I LOVE HER ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3831 len. 7]: repeated Ian with a strange exaltation .
Parsing [sent. 3832 len. 6]: `` Oh , Ian ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3833 len. 10]: groaned Alister ; `` how terrible for you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3834 len. 8]: `` Alister , you dear fellow ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3835 len. 12]: returned Ian , `` can you understand no better than that ?
Parsing [sent. 3836 len. 9]: Do you not see I am happy now ?
Parsing [sent. 3837 len. 24]: My trouble was that I did not love her -- not that she loved me , but that I did not love her !
Parsing [sent. 3838 len. 10]: Now we shall love each other for ever ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3839 len. 10]: `` How do you know that , Ian ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3840 len. 8]: `` By knowing that I love her .
Parsing [sent. 3841 len. 24]: If I had not come to know that , I could not have said to myself I would love her for ever . ''
Parsing [sent. 3842 len. 10]: `` But you ca n't marry her , Ian !
Parsing [sent. 3843 len. 11]: The Lord said there would be no marrying there ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3844 len. 13]: `` Did he say there would be no loving there , Alister ?
Parsing [sent. 3845 len. 28]: Most people seem to fancy he did , for how else could they forget the dead as they do , and look so little for their resurrection ?
Parsing [sent. 3846 len. 14]: Few can be said really to believe in any hereafter worth believing in .
Parsing [sent. 3847 len. 28]: How many go against the liking of the dead the moment they are gone-behave as if they were nowhere , and could never call them to account !
Parsing [sent. 3848 len. 19]: Their plans do not recognize their existence ; the life beyond is no factor in their life here .
Parsing [sent. 3849 len. 43]: If God has given me a hope altogether beyond anything I could have generated for myself , beyond all the likelihoods and fulfilments around me , what can I do but give him room to verify it -- what but look onward !
Parsing [sent. 3850 len. 51]: Some people 's bodies get so tired that they long for the rest of the grave ; it is my soul that gets tired , and I know the grave can give that no rest ; I look for the rest of more life , more strength , more love .
Parsing [sent. 3851 len. 47]: But God is not shut up in heaven , neither is there one law of life there and another here ; I desire more life here , and shall have it , for what is needful for this world is to be had in this world .
Parsing [sent. 3852 len. 14]: In proportion as I become one with God , I shall have it .
Parsing [sent. 3853 len. 44]: This world never did seem my home ; I have never felt quite comfortable in it ; I have yet to find , and shall find the perfect home I have not felt this world , even my mother 's bosom to be .
Parsing [sent. 3854 len. 10]: Nature herself is not lovely enough to satisfy me .
Parsing [sent. 3855 len. 25]: Nor can it be that I am beside myself , seeing I care only for the will of God , not for my own .
Parsing [sent. 3856 len. 13]: For what is madness but two or more wills in one body ?
Parsing [sent. 3857 len. 26]: Does not the ` Bible itself tell us that we are pilgrims and strangers in the world , that here we have no abiding city ?
Parsing [sent. 3858 len. 16]: It is but a place to which we come to be made ready for another .
Parsing [sent. 3859 len. 23]: Yet I am sure those who regard it as their home , are not half so well pleased with it as I .
Parsing [sent. 3860 len. 7]: They are always grumbling at it .
Parsing [sent. 3861 len. 6]: ` What wretched weather ! '
Parsing [sent. 3862 len. 3]: they say .
Parsing [sent. 3863 len. 7]: ` What a cursed misfortune ! '
Parsing [sent. 3864 len. 3]: they cry .
Parsing [sent. 3865 len. 6]: ` What abominable luck ! '
Parsing [sent. 3866 len. 3]: they protest .
Parsing [sent. 3867 len. 15]: Health is the first thing , they say , and can not find it .
Parsing [sent. 3868 len. 23]: They complain that their plans are thwarted , and when they succeed , that they do not yield the satisfaction they expected .
Parsing [sent. 3869 len. 13]: Yet they mock at him who says he seeks a better country !
Parsing [sent. 3870 len. 10]: -- But I am keeping you awake , Alister !
Parsing [sent. 3871 len. 6]: I will talk no more .
Parsing [sent. 3872 len. 7]: You must go to sleep ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3873 len. 18]: `` It is better than any sleep to hear you talk , Ian , '' returned Alister .
Parsing [sent. 3874 len. 10]: `` What a way you are ahead of me !
Parsing [sent. 3875 len. 6]: I do love this world !
Parsing [sent. 3876 len. 31]: When I come to die , it will tear my heart to think that this cave which you and I have dug out together , must pass into other hands !
Parsing [sent. 3877 len. 21]: I love every foot of the earth that remains to us -- every foot that has been taken from us .
Parsing [sent. 3878 len. 31]: When I stand on the top of this rock , and breathe the air of this mountain , I bless God we have still a spot to call our own .
Parsing [sent. 3879 len. 31]: It is quite a different thing from the love of mere land ; I could not feel the same toward any , however beautiful , that I had but bought .
Parsing [sent. 3880 len. 24]: This , our own old land , I feel as if I loved in something the same way as I love my mother .
Parsing [sent. 3881 len. 32]: Often in the hot summer-days , lying on my face in the grass , I have kissed the earth as if it were a live creature that could return my caresses !
Parsing [sent. 3882 len. 24]: The long grass is a passion to me , and next to the grass I love the heather , not the growing corn .
Parsing [sent. 3883 len. 29]: I am a fair farmer , I think , but I would rather see the land grow what it pleased , than pass into the hands of another .
Parsing [sent. 3884 len. 9]: Place is to me sacred almost as body .
Parsing [sent. 3885 len. 35]: There is at least something akin between the love we bear to the bodies of our friends , and that we bear to the place in which we were born and brought up . ''
Parsing [sent. 3886 len. 9]: `` That is all very true , Alister .
Parsing [sent. 3887 len. 11]: I understand your feeling perfectly ; I have it myself .
Parsing [sent. 3888 len. 30]: But we must be weaned , I say only weaned , from that kind of thing ; we must not love the outside as if it were the inside !
Parsing [sent. 3889 len. 44]: Everything comes that ' we may know the sender-of whom it is a symbol , that is , a far-off likeness of something in him ; and to him it must lead us-the self-existent , true , original love , the making love .
Parsing [sent. 3890 len. 8]: But I have felt all you say .
Parsing [sent. 3891 len. 31]: I used to lie in bed and imagine the earth alive and carrying me on her back , till I fell asleep longing to see the face of my nurse .
Parsing [sent. 3892 len. 9]: Once , the fancy turned into a dream .
Parsing [sent. 3893 len. 26]: I will try to recall a sonnet I made the same night , before the dream came : it will help you to understand it .
Parsing [sent. 3894 len. 9]: I was then about nineteen , I believe .
Parsing [sent. 3895 len. 24]: I did not care for it enough to repeat it to you , and I fear we shall find it very bad . ''
Parsing [sent. 3896 len. 98]: Stopping often to recall and rearrange words and lines , Ian completed at last the following sonnet : -- `` She set me on my feet with steady hand , Among the crowding marvels on her face , Bidding me rise , and run a strong man 's race ; Swathed mo in circumstance 's swaddling band ; Fed me with her own self ; then bade me stand MYself entire , -- while she was but a place Hewn for my dwelling from the midst of space , A something better than HER sea or land .
Parsing [sent. 3897 len. 4]: Nay , Earth !
Parsing [sent. 3898 len. 52]: thou bearest me upon thy back , Like a rough nurse , and I can almost feel A touch of kindness in thy bands of steel , Although I can not see thy face , and track An onward purpose shining through its black , Instinct with prophecy of future weal .
Parsing [sent. 3899 len. 3]: `` There !
Parsing [sent. 3900 len. 9]: It is not much , is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3901 len. 6]: `` It is beautiful ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3902 len. 3]: protested Alister .
Parsing [sent. 3903 len. 25]: `` It is worth nothing , '' said Ian , `` except between you and me-and that it will make you understand my dream .
Parsing [sent. 3904 len. 6]: That I shall never forget .
Parsing [sent. 3905 len. 12]: When a dream does us good we do n't forget it .
Parsing [sent. 3906 len. 32]: `` I thought I was home on the back of something great and strong-I could not tell what ; it might be an elephant or a great eagle or a lion .
Parsing [sent. 3907 len. 18]: It went sweeping swiftly along , the wind of its flight roaring past me in a tempest .
Parsing [sent. 3908 len. 6]: I began to grow frightened .
Parsing [sent. 3909 len. 12]: Where could this creature of such awful speed be carrying me ?
Parsing [sent. 3910 len. 10]: I prayed to God to take care of me .
Parsing [sent. 3911 len. 22]: The head of the creature turned to me , and I saw the face of a woman , grand and beautiful .
Parsing [sent. 3912 len. 12]: Never with my open eyes have I seen such a face !
Parsing [sent. 3913 len. 27]: And I knew it was the face of this earth , and that I had never seen it before because she carries us upon her back .
Parsing [sent. 3914 len. 37]: When I woke , I knew that all the strangest things in life and history must one day come together in a beautiful face of loving purpose , one of the faces of the living God .
Parsing [sent. 3915 len. 25]: The very mother of the Lord did not for a long time understand him , and only through sorrow came to see true glory .
Parsing [sent. 3916 len. 38]: Alister , if we were right with God , we could see the earth vanish and never heave a sigh ; God , of whom it was but a shimmering revelation , would still be ours ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3917 len. 21]: In the morning they fell asleep , and it was daylight , late in the winter , when Alister rose .
Parsing [sent. 3918 len. 27]: He roused the fire , asleep all through the night , and prepared their breakfast of porridge and butter , tea , oat-cake , and mutton-ham .
Parsing [sent. 3919 len. 45]: When it was nearly ready , he woke Ian , and when they had eaten , they read together a portion of the Bible , that they might not forget , and start the life of the day without trust in the life-causing God .
Parsing [sent. 3920 len. 31]: `` All that is not rooted in him , '' Ian would say , `` all hope or joy that does not turn its face upward , is an idolatry .
Parsing [sent. 3921 len. 12]: Our prayers must rise that our thoughts may follow them . ''
Parsing [sent. 3922 len. 25]: The portion they read contained the saying of the Lord that we must forsake all and follow him if we would be his disciples .
Parsing [sent. 3923 len. 42]: `` I am sometimes almost terrified , '' said Ian , `` at the scope of the demands made upon me , at the perfection of the self-abandonment required of me ; yet outside of such absoluteness can be no salvation .
Parsing [sent. 3924 len. 16]: In God we live every commonplace as well as most exalted moment of our being .
Parsing [sent. 3925 len. 28]: To trust in him when no need is pressing , when things seem going right of themselves , may be harder than when things seem going wrong .
Parsing [sent. 3926 len. 38]: At no time is there any danger except in ourselves , and the only danger is of trusting in something else than the living God , and so getting , as it were , outside of God .
Parsing [sent. 3927 len. 18]: Oh Alister , take care you do not love the land more than the will of God !
Parsing [sent. 3928 len. 17]: Take care you do not love even your people more than the will of God . ''
Parsing [sent. 3929 len. 32]: They spent the day on the hill-top , and as there was no sign of storm , remained till the dark night , when the moon came to light them home .
Parsing [sent. 3930 len. 25]: `` Perhaps when we are dead , '' said Alister as they went , `` we may be allowed to corne here again sometimes !
Parsing [sent. 3931 len. 25]: Only we shall not be able to quarry any further , and there is pain in looking on what can not go on . ''
Parsing [sent. 3932 len. 29]: `` It may be a special pleasure , '' returned Ian , `` in those new conditions , to look into such a changeless cabinet of the past .
Parsing [sent. 3933 len. 27]: When we are one with our life , so that no prayer can be denied , there will be no end to the lovely possibilities . ''
Parsing [sent. 3934 len. 24]: `` So I have the people I love , I think I could part with all things else , even the land ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3935 len. 3]: said Alister .
Parsing [sent. 3936 len. 12]: `` Be sure we shall not have to part with THEM .
Parsing [sent. 3937 len. 107]: We shall yet walk , I think , with our father as of old , where the setting sun sent the shadows of the big horse-gowans that glowed in his red level rays , trooping eastward , as if they would go round the world to meet the sun that had banished them , and die in his glory ; the wind of the twilight will again breathe about us like a thought of the living God haunting our goings , and watching to help us ; the stars will yet call to us out of the great night , ` Love and be fearless . '
Parsing [sent. 3938 len. 5]: ` Be independent ! '
Parsing [sent. 3939 len. 42]: cries the world from its ' great Bible of the Belly ; - says the Lord of men , ` Seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness , and all these things shall be added unto you . '
Parsing [sent. 3940 len. 6]: Our dependence is our eternity .
Parsing [sent. 3941 len. 15]: We can not live on bread alone ; we need every word of God .
Parsing [sent. 3942 len. 16]: We can not live on air alone ; we need an atmosphere of living souls .
Parsing [sent. 3943 len. 15]: Should we be freer , Alister , if we were independent of each other ?
Parsing [sent. 3944 len. 17]: When I am out in the world , my heart is always with mother and you .
Parsing [sent. 3945 len. 29]: We must be constantly giving ourselves away , we must dwell in houses of infinite dependence , or sit alone in the waste of a godless universe . ''
Parsing [sent. 3946 len. 19]: It was a rough walk in the moonlight over the hills , but full of a rare delight .
Parsing [sent. 3947 len. 41]: And while they walked the mother was waiting them , with the joy of St. John , of the Saviour , of God himself in her heart , the joy of beholding how the men she loved loved each other .
Parsing [sent. 3948 len. 3]: CHAPTER VI .
Parsing [sent. 3949 len. 4]: THE TWO PAIRS .
Parsing [sent. 3950 len. 24]: The next morning , on the way to the village , the brothers overtook Christina and Mercy , and they walked along together .
Parsing [sent. 3951 len. 27]: The young men felt inclined to be the more friendly with the girls , that the men of their own family were so unworthy of them .
Parsing [sent. 3952 len. 43]: A man who does not respect a woman because she is a woman , can not have thorough respect for his own mother , protest as he pleases : he is incapable of it , and can not know his own incapacity .
Parsing [sent. 3953 len. 27]: Alas for girls in a family where the atmosphere of vile thinking , winnowed by the carrion wings of degraded and degrading judgments , infolds them !
Parsing [sent. 3954 len. 24]: One of the marvels of the world is , that , with such fathers and brothers , there are so few wicked women .
Parsing [sent. 3955 len. 34]: Type of the greater number stands Ophelia , poor , weak , and not very refined , yet honest , and , in all her poverty , immeasurably superior to father and brother .
Parsing [sent. 3956 len. 47]: Christina 's condescension had by this time dwindled almost to the vanishing-point , and her talk was in consequence more natural : the company , conversation , and whole atmosphere of the young men , tended to wake in the girls what was best and sweetest .
Parsing [sent. 3957 len. 41]: Reality appeals at once to the real , opens the way for a soul to emerge from the fog of the commonplace , the marsh of platitude , the Sahara of lies , into the colour and air of life .
Parsing [sent. 3958 len. 16]: The better things of humanity often need the sun of friendship to wile them out .
Parsing [sent. 3959 len. 42]: A girl , well-bred , tolerably clever , and with some genius of accommodation , will appear to a man possessed of a hundred faculties of which she knows nothing ; but his belief will help to rouse them in her .
Parsing [sent. 3960 len. 37]: A young man will see an angel where those who love her best see only a nice girl ; but he sees not merely what she might be , but what one day she must be .
Parsing [sent. 3961 len. 23]: Christina had been at first rather taken with the ploughman , but she turned her masked batteries now mainly on the soldier .
Parsing [sent. 3962 len. 33]: During the dinner she had noted how entirely Ian was what she chose to call a man of the world ; and it rendered him in her eyes more worthy of conquest .
Parsing [sent. 3963 len. 14]: Besides , as elder sister , must she not protect the inexperienced Mercy ?
Parsing [sent. 3964 len. 7]: What is this passion for subjugation ?
Parsing [sent. 3965 len. 5]: this hunger for homage ?
Parsing [sent. 3966 len. 18]: Is it of hell direct , or what is there in it of good to begin with ?
Parsing [sent. 3967 len. 57]: Apparently it takes possession of such women as have set up each herself for the object of her worship : she can not then rest from the effort to bring as many as possible to worship at the same shrine ; and to this end will use means as deserving of the fire as any witchcraft .
Parsing [sent. 3968 len. 14]: Christina stopped short with a little cry , and caught Ian 's arm .
Parsing [sent. 3969 len. 21]: `` I beg your pardon , '' she said , `` but I can not bear it a moment longer !
Parsing [sent. 3970 len. 9]: Something in my boot hurts me so ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3971 len. 31]: She limped to the road-side , sat down , accepted the service of Ian to unlace her boot , and gave a sigh of relief when he pulled it off .
Parsing [sent. 3972 len. 19]: He inverted and shook it , then searched and found a nail which must have hurt her severely .
Parsing [sent. 3973 len. 10]: But how to get rid of the cruel projection !
Parsing [sent. 3974 len. 15]: Ian 's slender hand could but just reach with its finger-tips the haunted spot .
Parsing [sent. 3975 len. 14]: In vain he tried to knock it down against a stone put inside .
Parsing [sent. 3976 len. 5]: Alister could suggest nothing .
Parsing [sent. 3977 len. 16]: But Mistress Conal 's cottage was near : they might there find something to help !
Parsing [sent. 3978 len. 26]: Only Christina could not be left behind , and how was she to walk in a silk stocking over a road frozen hard as glass ?
Parsing [sent. 3979 len. 14]: The chief would have carried her , but she would not let him .
Parsing [sent. 3980 len. 16]: Ian therefore shod her with his Glengarry bonnet , tying it on with his handkerchief .
Parsing [sent. 3981 len. 35]: There was much merriment over the extemporized shoe , mingled with apologetic gratitude from Christina , who , laughing at her poulticed foot , was yet not displeased at its contrast with the other .
Parsing [sent. 3982 len. 19]: When the chief opened the door of the cottage , there was no one to be seen within .
Parsing [sent. 3983 len. 24]: The fire was burning hot and flameless ; a three-footed pot stood half in it ; other sign of presence they saw none .
Parsing [sent. 3984 len. 26]: As Alister stooped searching for some implement to serve their need , in shot a black cat , jumped over his back , and disappeared .
Parsing [sent. 3985 len. 22]: The same instant they heard a groan , and then first discovered the old woman in bed , seemingly very ill .
Parsing [sent. 3986 len. 6]: Ian went up to her .
Parsing [sent. 3987 len. 12]: `` What is the matter with you , Mistress Conal ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3988 len. 12]: he asked , addressing her in English because of the ladies .
Parsing [sent. 3989 len. 24]: But in reply she poured out a torrent of Gaelic , which seemed to the girls only grumbling , but was something stronger .
Parsing [sent. 3990 len. 18]: Thereupon the chief went and spoke to her , but she was short and sullen with him .
Parsing [sent. 3991 len. 8]: He left her to resume his search .
Parsing [sent. 3992 len. 8]: `` Let alone , '' she cried .
Parsing [sent. 3993 len. 16]: `` When that nail leaves her brog , it will be for your heart . ''
Parsing [sent. 3994 len. 6]: Ian sought to soothe her .
Parsing [sent. 3995 len. 10]: `` She will bring misery on you all ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3996 len. 3]: she insisted .
Parsing [sent. 3997 len. 11]: `` You have a hammer somewhere , I know ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3998 len. 11]: said Alister , as if he had not heard her .
Parsing [sent. 3999 len. 12]: `` She shall be finding no help in MY house ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4000 len. 7]: answered the old woman in English .
Parsing [sent. 4001 len. 8]: `` Very well , Mistress Conal ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4002 len. 20]: returned the chief ; `` the lady can not walk home ; I shall have to carry her ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4003 len. 5]: `` God forbid ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4004 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 4005 len. 8]: `` Go and fetch a wheelbarrow . ''
Parsing [sent. 4006 len. 18]: `` Mistress Conal , there is nothing for it but carry her home in my arms ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4007 len. 8]: `` Give me the cursed brog then .
Parsing [sent. 4008 len. 7]: I will draw the nail . ''
Parsing [sent. 4009 len. 40]: But the chief would not yield the boot ; he went out and searched the hill-side until he found a smooth stone of suitable size , with which and a pair of tongs , he beat down the nail .
Parsing [sent. 4010 len. 12]: Christina put on the boot , and they left the place .
Parsing [sent. 4011 len. 21]: The chief stayed behind the rest for a moment , but the old woman would not even acknowledge his presence .
Parsing [sent. 4012 len. 9]: `` What a rude old thing she is !
Parsing [sent. 4013 len. 9]: This is how she always treats us ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4014 len. 3]: said Christina .
Parsing [sent. 4015 len. 10]: `` Have you done anything to offend her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4016 len. 3]: asked Alister .
Parsing [sent. 4017 len. 7]: `` Not that we know of .
Parsing [sent. 4018 len. 8]: We ca n't help being lowlanders ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4019 len. 22]: `` She no doubt bears you a grudge , '' said Ian , `` for having what once belonged to us .
Parsing [sent. 4020 len. 8]: I am sorry she is so unfriendly .
Parsing [sent. 4021 len. 11]: It is not a common fault with our people . ''
Parsing [sent. 4022 len. 5]: `` Poor old thing !
Parsing [sent. 4023 len. 6]: what does it matter ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4024 len. 3]: said Christina .
Parsing [sent. 4025 len. 16]: A woman 's hate was to her no more than the barking of a dog .
Parsing [sent. 4026 len. 20]: They had not gone far , before the nail again asserted itself ; it had been but partially subjugated .
Parsing [sent. 4027 len. 5]: A consultation was held .
Parsing [sent. 4028 len. 24]: It resulted in this , that Mercy and the chief went to fetch another pair of boots , while Ian remained with Christina .
Parsing [sent. 4029 len. 10]: They seated themselves on a stone by the roadside .
Parsing [sent. 4030 len. 14]: The sun clouded over , a keen wind blew , and Christina shivered .
Parsing [sent. 4031 len. 12]: There was nothing for it but go back to the cottage .
Parsing [sent. 4032 len. 16]: The key was in the door , Ian turned it , and they went in .
Parsing [sent. 4033 len. 8]: Certainly this time no one was there .
Parsing [sent. 4034 len. 12]: The old woman so lately groaning on her bed had vanished .
Parsing [sent. 4035 len. 17]: Ian made up the fire , and did what he could for his companion 's comfort .
Parsing [sent. 4036 len. 35]: She was not pleased with the tone of his attentions , but the way she accepted them made her appear more pleased than Ian cared for , and he became colder and more polite .
Parsing [sent. 4037 len. 57]: Piqued by his indifference , she took it nevertheless with a sweetness which belonged to her nature as God made it , not as she had spoiled it ; and even such a butterfly as she , felt the influence of a man like Ian , and could not help being more natural in his presence .
Parsing [sent. 4038 len. 29]: His truth elicited what there was of hers ; the trae being drew to the surface what there was of true in the being that was not true .
Parsing [sent. 4039 len. 27]: The longer she was in his company , the more she was pleased with him , and the more annoyed with her failure in pleasing him .
Parsing [sent. 4040 len. 28]: It is generally more or less awkward when a young man and maiden between whom is no convergent rush of spiritual currents , find themselves alone together .
Parsing [sent. 4041 len. 73]: Ian was one of the last to feel such awkwardness , but he thought his companion felt it ; he did his best , therefore , to make her forget herself and him , telling her story after story which she could not but find the more interesting that for the time she was quieted from self , and placed in the humbler and healthier position of receiving the influence of another .
Parsing [sent. 4042 len. 67]: For one moment , as he was narrating a hair 's - breadth escape he had had from a company of Tartar soldiers by the friendliness of a young girl , the daughter of a Siberian convict , she found herself under the charm of a certain potency of which he was himself altogether unconscious , but which had carried away hearts more indifferent than hers .
Parsing [sent. 4043 len. 27]: In the meantime , Alister and Mercy were walking toward the New House , and , walking , were more comfortable than those that sat waiting .
Parsing [sent. 4044 len. 26]: Mercy indeed had not much to say , but she was capable of asking a question worth answering , and of understanding not a little .
Parsing [sent. 4045 len. 23]: Thinking of her walk with Ian on Christmas day , -- `` Would you mind telling me something about your brother ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4046 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 4047 len. 11]: `` What would you like to know about him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4048 len. 3]: asked Alister .
Parsing [sent. 4049 len. 12]: `` Anything you care to tell me , '' she answered .
Parsing [sent. 4050 len. 58]: Now there was nothing pleased Alister better than talking about Ian ; and he talked so that Mercy could not help feeling what a brother he must be himself ; while on his part Alister was delighted with the girl who took such an interest in Ian : for Ian 's sake he began to love Mercy .
Parsing [sent. 4051 len. 20]: He had never yet been what is called in love -- had little opportunity indeed of falling in love .
Parsing [sent. 4052 len. 54]: His breeding had been that of a gentleman , and notwithstanding the sweetness and gentleness of the maidens of his clan , there were differences which had as yet proved sufficient to prevent the first approaches of love , though , once entertained , they might have added to the depth of it .
Parsing [sent. 4053 len. 60]: At the same time it was by no means impossible for Alister to fall in love with even an uneducated girl -- so-called ; neither would he , in that case , have felt any difficulty about marrying her ; but the fatherly relation in which he stood toward his clan , had tended rather to prevent the thing .
Parsing [sent. 4054 len. 20]: Many a youth falls to premature love-making , from the lack in his daily history of the womanly element .
Parsing [sent. 4055 len. 14]: Matrons in towns should be exhorted to make of their houses a refuge .
Parsing [sent. 4056 len. 26]: Too many mothers are anxious for what they count the welfare of their own children , and care nothing for the children of other women !
Parsing [sent. 4057 len. 30]: But can we wonder , when they will wallow in mean - nesses to save their own from poverty and health , and damn them into comfort and decay .
Parsing [sent. 4058 len. 13]: Alister told Mercy how Ian and he used to spend their boyhood .
Parsing [sent. 4059 len. 32]: He recounted some of their adventures in hunting and herding and fishing , and even in going to and from school , a distance of five miles , in all weathers .
Parsing [sent. 4060 len. 52]: Then he got upon the poetry of the people , their legends , their ballads and their songs ; and at last came to the poetry of the country itself -- the delights of following the plough , the whispers and gleams of nature , her endless appeal through every sense .
Parsing [sent. 4061 len. 20]: The mere smell of the earth in a spring morning , he said , always made him praise God .
Parsing [sent. 4062 len. 17]: `` Everything we have , '' he went on , `` must be shared with God .
Parsing [sent. 4063 len. 9]: That is the notion of the Jewish thank-offering .
Parsing [sent. 4064 len. 17]: Ian says the greatest word in the universe is ONE ; the next greatest , ALL .
Parsing [sent. 4065 len. 20]: They are but the two ends of a word to us unknowable -- God 's name for himself . ''
Parsing [sent. 4066 len. 44]: Mercy had read Mrs. Barbauld 's Hymns , and they had been something to her ; but most of the little poetry she had read was only platitude sweetened with sound ; she had never read , certainly never understood a real poem .
Parsing [sent. 4067 len. 18]: Who can tell what a nature may prove , after feeding on good food for a while ?
Parsing [sent. 4068 len. 11]: The queen bee is only a better fed working bee .
Parsing [sent. 4069 len. 44]: Who can tell what it may prove when it has been ploughed with the plough of suffering , when the rains of sorrow , the frosts of pain , and the winds of poverty have moistened and swelled and dried its fallow clods ?
Parsing [sent. 4070 len. 18]: Mercy had not such a sweet temper as her sister , but she was not so selfish .
Parsing [sent. 4071 len. 15]: She was readier to take offence , perhaps just because she was less self-satisfied .
Parsing [sent. 4072 len. 7]: Before long they might change places .
Parsing [sent. 4073 len. 12]: A little dew from the eternal fountain was falling upon them .
Parsing [sent. 4074 len. 26]: Christina was beginning to be aware that a certain man , neither rich nor distinguished nor ambitious , had yet a real charm for her .
Parsing [sent. 4075 len. 14]: Not that for a moment she would think seriously of such a man !
Parsing [sent. 4076 len. 6]: That would he simply idiotic !
Parsing [sent. 4077 len. 23]: But it would be very nice to have a little innocent flirtation with him , or perhaps a `` Platonic friendship ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4078 len. 7]: -- her phrase , not mine .
Parsing [sent. 4079 len. 34]: What could she have to do with Plato , who , when she said I , was aware only of a neat bundle of foolish desires , not the God at her heart !
Parsing [sent. 4080 len. 22]: Mercy , on the other hand , was being drawn to the big , strong , childlike heart of the chief .
Parsing [sent. 4081 len. 21]: There is always , notwithstanding the gulf of unlikeness between them , an appeal from the childish to the childlike .
Parsing [sent. 4082 len. 22]: The childish is but the shadow of the childlike , and shadows are little like the things from which they fall .
Parsing [sent. 4083 len. 21]: But to what save the heavenly shall the earthly appeal in its sore need , its widowhood , its orphanage ?
Parsing [sent. 4084 len. 11]: with what shall the childish take refuge but the childlike ?
Parsing [sent. 4085 len. 8]: to what shall ignorance cry but wisdom ?
Parsing [sent. 4086 len. 11]: Mercy felt no restraint with the chief as with Ian .
Parsing [sent. 4087 len. 16]: His great , deep , yet refined and musical laugh , set her at ease .
Parsing [sent. 4088 len. 23]: Ian 's smile , with its shim -- mering eternity , was no more than the moon on a rain-pool to Mercy .
Parsing [sent. 4089 len. 15]: The moral health of the chief made an atmosphere of conscious safety around her .
Parsing [sent. 4090 len. 13]: By the side of no other man had she ever felt so .
Parsing [sent. 4091 len. 10]: With him she was at home , therefore happy .
Parsing [sent. 4092 len. 9]: She was already growing under his genial influence .
Parsing [sent. 4093 len. 10]: Every being has such influence who is not selfish .
Parsing [sent. 4094 len. 35]: When Christina was re-shod , and they were leaving the cottage , Ian , happening to look behind him , spied the black cat perched on the edge of the chimney in the smoke .
Parsing [sent. 4095 len. 24]: `` Look at her , '' he said , `` pretending innocence , when she has been watching you all the time ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4096 len. 6]: Alister took up a stone .
Parsing [sent. 4097 len. 15]: `` Do n't hurt her , '' said Ian , and he dropped it .
Parsing [sent. 4098 len. 3]: CHAPTER VII .
Parsing [sent. 4099 len. 4]: AN CABRACH MOR .
Parsing [sent. 4100 len. 15]: I have already said that the young men had not done well as hunters .
Parsing [sent. 4101 len. 19]: They had neither experience nor trustworthy attendance : none of the chief 's men would hunt with them .
Parsing [sent. 4102 len. 25]: They looked on them as intruders , and those who did not share in their chiefs dislike to useless killing , yet respected it .
Parsing [sent. 4103 len. 32]: Neither Christian nor Sercombe had yet shot a single stag , and the time was drawing nigh when they must return , the one to Glasgow , the other to London .
Parsing [sent. 4104 len. 26]: To have no proof of prowess to display was humbling to Sercombe ; he must show a stag 's head , or hide his own !
Parsing [sent. 4105 len. 31]: He resolved , therefore , one of the next moonlit nights , to stalk by himself a certain great , wide-horned stag , of whose habits he had received information .
Parsing [sent. 4106 len. 25]: At Oxford , where Valentine made his acquaintance , Sercombe belonged to a fast set , but had distinguished himself notwithstanding as an athlete .
Parsing [sent. 4107 len. 32]: He was a great favourite with a few , not the best of the set , and admired by many for his confidence , his stature , and his regular features .
Parsing [sent. 4108 len. 50]: These latter wore , however , a self-assertion which of others made him much disliked : a mean thing in itself , it had the meanest origin -- the ability , namely , to spend money , for he was the favourite son of a rich banker in London .
Parsing [sent. 4109 len. 35]: He knew nothing of the first business of life -- self-restraint , had never denied himself anything , and but for social influences would , in manhood as infancy , have obeyed every impulse .
Parsing [sent. 4110 len. 41]: He was one of the merest slaves in the universe , a slave in his very essence , for he counted wrong to others freedom for himself , and the rejection of the laws of his own being , liberty .
Parsing [sent. 4111 len. 31]: The most righteous interference was insolence ; his likings were his rights , and any devil that could whisper him a desire , might do with him as he pleased .
Parsing [sent. 4112 len. 20]: From such a man every true nature shrinks with involuntary recoil , and a sick sense of the inhuman .
Parsing [sent. 4113 len. 41]: But I have said more of him already than my history requires , and more than many a reader , partaking himself of his character to an unsuspected degree , will believe ; for such men can not know themselves .
Parsing [sent. 4114 len. 29]: He had not yet in the eyes of the world disgraced himself : it takes a good many disgraceful things to bring a rich man to outward disgrace .
Parsing [sent. 4115 len. 26]: His sole attendant when shooting was a clever vagabond lad belonging to nowhere in particular , and living by any crook except the shepherd 's .
Parsing [sent. 4116 len. 33]: From him he heard of the great stag , and the spots which in the valleys he frequented , often scraping away the snow with his feet to get at the grass .
Parsing [sent. 4117 len. 26]: He did not inform him that the animal was a special favourite with the chief of Clanruadh , or that the clan looked upon him .
Parsing [sent. 4118 len. 19]: as their live symbol , the very stag represented as crest to the chief 's coat of arms .
Parsing [sent. 4119 len. 20]: It was the same Nancy had reported to her master as eating grass on the burn-side in the moonlight .
Parsing [sent. 4120 len. 14]: Christian and Sercombe had stalked him day after day , but without success .
Parsing [sent. 4121 len. 19]: And now , with one poor remaining hope , the latter had determined to stalk him at night .
Parsing [sent. 4122 len. 111]: To despoil him of his life , his glorious rush over the mountain side , his plunge into the valley , and fierce strain up the opposing hill ; to see that ideal of strength , suppleness , and joyous flight , lie nerveless and flaccid at his feet ; to be able to call the thicket-like antlers of the splendid animal his own , was for the time the one ambition of Hilary Sercombe ; for he was of the brood of Mephistopheles , the child of darkness , whose delight lies in undoing what God has done -- the nearest that any evil power can come to creating .
Parsing [sent. 4123 len. 25]: There was , however , a reason for the failure of the young hunters beyond lack of skill and what they called their ill-luck .
Parsing [sent. 4124 len. 29]: Hector of the Stags was awake ; his keen , everywhere-roving eyes were upon them , seconded by the keen , all-hearkening ears of Bob of the Angels .
Parsing [sent. 4125 len. 54]: They had discovered that the two men had set their hearts on the big stag , an cabrach mor by right of excellence , and every time they were out after him , Hector too was out with his spy-glass , the gift of an old sea-faring friend , searching the billowy hills .
Parsing [sent. 4126 len. 62]: While , the southrons would be toiling along to get the wind of him unseen , for the old stag 's eyes were as keen as his velvety nose , the father and son would be lying , perhaps close at hand , perhaps far away on some hill-side of another valley , watching now the hunters , now the stag .
Parsing [sent. 4127 len. 20]: For love of the Macruadh , and for love of the stag , they had constituted themselves his guardians .
Parsing [sent. 4128 len. 95]: Again and again when one of them thought he was going to have a splendid chance -- perhaps just as , having reached a rock to which he had been making his weary way over stones and bogs like Satan through chaos , and raised himself with weary slowness , he peeped at last over the top , and lo , there he was , well within range , quietly feeding , nought between the great pumping of his big joyous heart and the hot bullet but the brown skin behind his left shoulder !
Parsing [sent. 4129 len. 64]: -- a distant shot would forestall the nigh one , a shot for life , not death , and the stag , knowing instantly by wondrous combination of sense and judgment in what quarter lay the danger , would , without once looking round , measure straight a hundred yards of hillocks and rocks between the sight-taking and the pulling of the trigger .
Parsing [sent. 4130 len. 77]: Another time it would be no shot , but the bark of a dog , the cry of a moorfowl , or a signal from watching hind that started him ; for the creatures understand each the other 's cries , and when an animal sees one of any sort on the watch to warn covey or herd or flock of its own kind , it will itself keep no watch , but feed in security .
Parsing [sent. 4131 len. 47]: To Christian and Sercombe it seemed as if all the life in the glen were in conspiracy to frustrate their hearts ' desire ; and the latter at least grew ever the more determined to kill the great stag : he had begun to hate him .
Parsing [sent. 4132 len. 32]: The sounds that warned the stag were by no means always what they seemed , those of other wild animals ; they were often hut imitations by Bob of the Angels .
Parsing [sent. 4133 len. 28]: I fear the animal grew somewhat bolder and less careful from the assurance thus given him that he was watched over , and cultivated a little nonchalance .
Parsing [sent. 4134 len. 75]: Not a moment , however , did he neglect any warning from quarter soever , but from peaceful feeder was instantaneously wind-like fleer , his great horns thrown back over his shoulders , and his four legs just touching the ground with elastic hoof , or tucking themselves almost out of sight as he skipped rather than leaped over rock and gully , stone and bush -- whatever lay betwixt him and larger room .
Parsing [sent. 4135 len. 24]: Great joy it was to his two guardians to see him , and great game to watch the motions of his discomfited enemies .
Parsing [sent. 4136 len. 15]: For the sake of an cabrach Hector and Bob would go hungry for hours .
Parsing [sent. 4137 len. 36]: But they never imagined the luxurious Sasunnach , incapable , as they thought , of hardship or sustained fatigue , would turn from his warm bed to stalk the lordly animal betwixt snow and moon .
Parsing [sent. 4138 len. 13]: One night , Hector of the Stags found he could not sleep .
Parsing [sent. 4139 len. 17]: It was not for cold , for the night was for the season a mild one .
Parsing [sent. 4140 len. 22]: The snow indeed lay deep around their dwelling , but they owed not a little of its warmth to the snow .
Parsing [sent. 4141 len. 29]: It drifted up all about it , and kept off the terrible winds that swept along the side of the hill , like sharp swift scythes of death .
Parsing [sent. 4142 len. 51]: They were in the largest and most comfortable of their huts -- a deepish hollow in the limestone rock , lined with turf , and with wattles filled in with heather , the tops outward ; its front a thick wall of turf , with a tolerable door of deal .
Parsing [sent. 4143 len. 12]: It was indeed so snug as to be far from airy .
Parsing [sent. 4144 len. 41]: Here they kept what little store of anything they had -- some dried fish and venison ; a barrel of oat-meal , seldom filled full ; a few skins of wild creatures , and powder , ball , and shot .
Parsing [sent. 4145 len. 30]: After many fruitless attempts to catch the still fleeting vapour sleep , raising himself at last on his elbow , Hector found that Rob was not by his side .
Parsing [sent. 4146 len. 24]: He too had been unable to sleep , and at last discovered that he was uneasy about something-what , he could not tell .
Parsing [sent. 4147 len. 6]: He rose and went out .
Parsing [sent. 4148 len. 32]: The moon was shining very clear , and as there was much snow , the night , if not so bright as day , was yet brighter than many a day .
Parsing [sent. 4149 len. 42]: The moon , the snow , the mountains , all dreaming awake , seemed to Rob the same as usual ; but presently he fancied the hillside opposite had come nearer than usual : there must be a reason for that !
Parsing [sent. 4150 len. 14]: He searched every yard of it with keenest gaze , but saw nothing .
Parsing [sent. 4151 len. 44]: They were high above Glenruadh , and commanded parts of it : late though it was , Rob thought he saw some light from the New House , which itself he could not see , reflected from some shadowed evergreen in the shrubbery .
Parsing [sent. 4152 len. 29]: He was thinking some one might be ill , and he ought to run down and See whether a messenger was wanted , when his father joined him .
Parsing [sent. 4153 len. 18]: He had brought his telescope , and immediately began to sweep the moonlight on the opposite hill .
Parsing [sent. 4154 len. 20]: In a moment he touched Rob on the shoulder , and handed him the telescope , pointing with it .
Parsing [sent. 4155 len. 16]: Rob looked and saw a dark speck on the snow , moving along the hill-side .
Parsing [sent. 4156 len. 6]: It was the big stag .
Parsing [sent. 4157 len. 36]: Now and then he would stop to snuff and search for a mouthful , but was evidently making for one of his feeding-places -- most likely that by the burn on the chief 's land .
Parsing [sent. 4158 len. 3]: The light !
Parsing [sent. 4159 len. 5]: could it imply danger ?
Parsing [sent. 4160 len. 26]: He had heard the young men were going to leave : were they about to attempt a last assault on the glory of the glen ?
Parsing [sent. 4161 len. 16]: He pointed out to his father the dim light in the shadow of the house .
Parsing [sent. 4162 len. 26]: Hector turned his telescope thitherward , immediately gave the glass to Bob , went into the hut , and came out again with his gun .
Parsing [sent. 4163 len. 21]: They had not gone far when they lost sight of the stag , but they held on towards the castle .
Parsing [sent. 4164 len. 39]: At every point whence a peep could be had in the direction of the house , they halted to reconnoitre : if enemies were abroad , they must , if possible , get and keep sight of them .
Parsing [sent. 4165 len. 42]: They did not stop for more than a glance , however , but made for the valley as fast as they could walk : the noise of running feet would , on such a still night , be heard too far .
Parsing [sent. 4166 len. 18]: The whole way , without sound uttered , father and son kept interchanging ideas on the matter .
Parsing [sent. 4167 len. 48]: From thorough acquaintance with the habits of the animal , they were pretty certain he was on his way to the haunt aforementioned : if he got there , he would be safe ; it was the chiefs ground , and no one would dare touch him .
Parsing [sent. 4168 len. 36]: But he was not yet upon it , and was in danger ; while , if he should leave the spot in any westward direction , he would almost at once be out of sanctuary !
Parsing [sent. 4169 len. 41]: If they found him therefore at his usual feed , and danger threatening , they must scare him eastward ; if no peril seemed at hand , they would watch him a while , that he might feed in safety .
Parsing [sent. 4170 len. 35]: Swift and all but soundless on their quiet brogs they paced along : to startle the deer while the hunter was far off , might be to drive him within range of his shot .
Parsing [sent. 4171 len. 27]: They reached the root of the spur , and approached the castle ; immediately beyond that , they would be in sight of the feeding ground .
Parsing [sent. 4172 len. 22]: But they were yet behind it when Rob of the Angels bounded forward in terror at the sound of a gun .
Parsing [sent. 4173 len. 15]: His father , however , who was in front , was off before him .
Parsing [sent. 4174 len. 32]: Neither hearing anything , nor seeing Rob , he knew that a shot had been fired , and , caution being now useless , was in a moment at full speed .
Parsing [sent. 4175 len. 17]: The smoke of the shot hung white in the moonlight over the end of the ridge .
Parsing [sent. 4176 len. 19]: No red bulk shadowed the green pasture , no thicket of horns went shaking about over the sod .
Parsing [sent. 4177 len. 41]: No lord of creation , but an enemy of life , stood regarding his work , a tumbled heap of death , yet saying to himself , like God when he made the world , `` It is good . ''
Parsing [sent. 4178 len. 33]: The noble creature lay disformed on the grass ; shot through the heart he had leaped high in the air , fallen with his head under him , and broken his neck .
Parsing [sent. 4179 len. 10]: Rage filled the heart of Hector of the Stags .
Parsing [sent. 4180 len. 20]: He could not curse , but he gave a roar like a wild beast , and raised his gun .
Parsing [sent. 4181 len. 13]: But Rob of the Angels caught it ere it reached his shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 4182 len. 19]: He yielded it , and , with another roar like a lion , bounded bare-handed upon the enemy .
Parsing [sent. 4183 len. 14]: He took the descent in three leaps , and the burn in one .
Parsing [sent. 4184 len. 31]: It was not merely that the enemy had killed an cabrach mor , the great stag of their love ; he had killed him on the chief 's own land !
Parsing [sent. 4185 len. 16]: under the very eyes of the man whose business it was to watch over him !
Parsing [sent. 4186 len. 6]: It was an offence unpardonable !
Parsing [sent. 4187 len. 11]: an insult as well as a wrong to his chief !
Parsing [sent. 4188 len. 14]: In the fierce majesty of righteous wrath he threw himself on the poacher .
Parsing [sent. 4189 len. 15]: Sercombe met him with a blow straight from the shoulder , and he dropped .
Parsing [sent. 4190 len. 14]: Rob of the Angels , close behind him , threw down the gun .
Parsing [sent. 4191 len. 11]: The devil all but got into Rob of the Angels .
Parsing [sent. 4192 len. 15]: His knife flashed pale in the moonlight , and he darted on the Sasunnach .
Parsing [sent. 4193 len. 83]: It would then have gone ill with the bigger man , for Bob was lithe as a snake , swift not only to parry and dodge but to strike ; he could not have reached the body of his antagonist , but Sercombe 's arm would have had at least one terrible gash from his skean-dhu , sharp as a razor , had not , at the moment , from the top of the ridge come the stern voice of the chief .
Parsing [sent. 4194 len. 38]: Rob 's knife , like Excalibur from the hand of Sir Bedivere , `` made lightnings in the splendour of the moon , '' as he threw it from him , and himself down by his father .
Parsing [sent. 4195 len. 8]: Then Hector came to himself and rose .
Parsing [sent. 4196 len. 32]: Rob rose also ; and his father , trembling with excitement , stood grasping his arm , for he saw the stalwart form of his chief on the ridge above them .
Parsing [sent. 4197 len. 22]: Alister had been waked by the gun , and at the roar of his friend Hector , sprang from his bed .
Parsing [sent. 4198 len. 20]: When he saw his beloved stag dead on his pasture , he came down the ridge like an avalanche .
Parsing [sent. 4199 len. 25]: Sercombe stood on his defence , wondering what devil was to pay , but beginning to think he might be in some wrong box .
Parsing [sent. 4200 len. 35]: He had taken no trouble to understand the boundaries between Mr. Peregrine Palmer 's land and that of the chief , and had imagined himself safe on the south side of the big burn .
Parsing [sent. 4201 len. 17]: Alister gazed speechless for a moment on the slaughtered stag , and heaved a great sigh .
Parsing [sent. 4202 len. 19]: `` Mr. Sercombe , '' he said , `` I would rather you had shot my best horse !
Parsing [sent. 4203 len. 13]: Are you aware , sir , that you are a poacher ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4204 len. 12]: `` I had supposed the appellation inapplicable to a gentleman ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4205 len. 7]: answered Sercombe , with entire coolness .
Parsing [sent. 4206 len. 12]: `` But by all means take me before a magistrate . ''
Parsing [sent. 4207 len. 8]: `` You are before a magistrate . ''
Parsing [sent. 4208 len. 27]: `` All I have to answer then is , that I should not have shot the animal had I not believed myself within my rights . ''
Parsing [sent. 4209 len. 17]: `` On that point , and on this very ground , I instructed you myself ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4210 len. 4]: said the chief .
Parsing [sent. 4211 len. 6]: `` I misunderstood you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4212 len. 25]: `` Say rather you had not the courtesy to heed what I told you-had not faith enough to take the word of a gentleman !
Parsing [sent. 4213 len. 10]: And for this my poor stag has suffered ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4214 len. 14]: He stood for some moments in conflict with himself , then quietly resumed .
Parsing [sent. 4215 len. 17]: `` Of course , Mr. Sercombe , I have no intention of pushing the matter ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4216 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 4217 len. 7]: `` I should hope not ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4218 len. 4]: returned Sercombe scornfully .
Parsing [sent. 4219 len. 14]: `` I will pay whatever you choose to set on the brute . ''
Parsing [sent. 4220 len. 27]: It would be hard to say which was less agreeable to the chief-to have his stag called a brute , or be offered blood-money for him .
Parsing [sent. 4221 len. 9]: `` Stag Ruadh priced like a bullock ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4222 len. 23]: he said , with a slow smile , full of sadness ; '' -- the pride of every child in the strath !
Parsing [sent. 4223 len. 14]: Not a gentleman in the county would have shot Clanruadh 's deer ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4224 len. 14]: Sercombe was by this time feeling uncomfortable , and it made him angry .
Parsing [sent. 4225 len. 6]: He muttered something about superstition .
Parsing [sent. 4226 len. 23]: `` He was taken when a calf , '' the chief went on , `` and given to a great-aunt of mine .
Parsing [sent. 4227 len. 29]: But when he grew up , he took to the hills again , and was known by his silver collar till he managed to rid himself of it .
Parsing [sent. 4228 len. 24]: He shall he buried where he lies , and his monument shall tell how the stranger Sasunnach served the stag of Clanruadh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4229 len. 26]: `` Why the deuce did n't you keep the precious monster in a paddock , and let people know him for a tame animal ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4230 len. 3]: sneered Sercombe .
Parsing [sent. 4231 len. 6]: `` My poor Euadh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4232 len. 11]: said the chief ; `` he was no tame animal !
Parsing [sent. 4233 len. 19]: He as well as I would have preferred the death you have given him to such a fate .
Parsing [sent. 4234 len. 6]: He lived while he lived !
Parsing [sent. 4235 len. 8]: I thank you for his immediate transit .
Parsing [sent. 4236 len. 6]: Shot right through the heart !
Parsing [sent. 4237 len. 11]: Had you maimed him I should have been angrier . ''
Parsing [sent. 4238 len. 22]: Sercombe felt flattered , and , attributing the chief 's gentleness to a desire to please him , began to condescend .
Parsing [sent. 4239 len. 9]: `` Well , come now , Macruadh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4240 len. 10]: he began ; but the chief turned from him .
Parsing [sent. 4241 len. 18]: Hector stood with his arm on Rob 's shoulder , and the tears rolling down his cheeks .
Parsing [sent. 4242 len. 15]: He would not have wept but that the sobs of his son shook him .
Parsing [sent. 4243 len. 30]: `` Rob of the Angels , '' Alister said in their mother-tongue , `` you must make an apology to the Sasunnach gentleman for drawing the knife on him .
Parsing [sent. 4244 len. 15]: That was wrong , if he had killed all the deer in Benruadh . ''
Parsing [sent. 4245 len. 16]: `` It was not for that , Macruadh , '' answered Rob of the Angels .
Parsing [sent. 4246 len. 21]: `` It was because he struck my father , and laid a better man than himself on the grass . ''
Parsing [sent. 4247 len. 7]: The chief turned to the Englishman .
Parsing [sent. 4248 len. 12]: `` Did the old man strike you , Mr. Sercombe ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4249 len. 6]: `` No , by Jove !
Parsing [sent. 4250 len. 8]: I took a little care of that !
Parsing [sent. 4251 len. 15]: If he had , I would have broke every bone in his body ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4252 len. 9]: `` Why did you strike him then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4253 len. 8]: `` Because he rushed at me . ''
Parsing [sent. 4254 len. 10]: `` It was his duty to capture a poacher !
Parsing [sent. 4255 len. 13]: -- But you did not know he was deaf and dumb ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4256 len. 7]: Alister added , as some excuse .
Parsing [sent. 4257 len. 8]: `` The deaf makes no difference ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4258 len. 3]: protested Bob .
Parsing [sent. 4259 len. 16]: `` Hector of the Stags does not fight with his hands like a woman ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4260 len. 10]: `` Well , what 's done is done ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4261 len. 3]: laughed Sercombe .
Parsing [sent. 4262 len. 10]: `` It was n't a bad shot anyhow ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4263 len. 13]: `` You have little to plume yourself upon , Mr. Sercombe ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4264 len. 4]: said the chief .
Parsing [sent. 4265 len. 26]: `` You are a good shot , but you need not have been so frightened at an old man as to knock him down ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4266 len. 7]: `` Come , come , Macruadh !
Parsing [sent. 4267 len. 4]: enough 's enough !
Parsing [sent. 4268 len. 8]: It 's time to drop this ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4269 len. 3]: returned Sercombe .
Parsing [sent. 4270 len. 10]: `` I ca n't stand much more of it !
Parsing [sent. 4271 len. 8]: -- Take ten pounds for the head !
Parsing [sent. 4272 len. 4]: -- Come ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4273 len. 22]: The chief made one great stride towards him , but turned away , and said , `` Come along , Rob !
Parsing [sent. 4274 len. 14]: Tell your father you must not go up the hill again to-night . ''
Parsing [sent. 4275 len. 21]: `` No , sir , '' answered Bob ; `` there 's nothing now to go up the hill for !
Parsing [sent. 4276 len. 4]: Poor old Buadh !
Parsing [sent. 4277 len. 6]: God rest his soul ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4278 len. 4]: `` Amen ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4279 len. 19]: responded the chief ; `` but say rather , ` God give him room to run ! ' ''
Parsing [sent. 4280 len. 3]: `` Amen !
Parsing [sent. 4281 len. 4]: It is better .
Parsing [sent. 4282 len. 15]: -- But , '' added Kob , `` we must watch by the body .
Parsing [sent. 4283 len. 27]: The foxes and hooded crows are gathering already -- I hear them on the hills ; and I saw a sea-eagle as white as silver yesterday !
Parsing [sent. 4284 len. 14]: We can not leave Ruadh till he is iznder God 's plaid ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4285 len. 17]: `` Then one of you come and fetch food and fire , '' said the chief .
Parsing [sent. 4286 len. 9]: `` I will be with you early . ''
Parsing [sent. 4287 len. 14]: Father and son communicated in silence , and Rob went with the chief .
Parsing [sent. 4288 len. 17]: `` They worship the stag , these peasants , as the old Egyptians the bull ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4289 len. 11]: said Sercombe to himself , walking home full of contempt .
Parsing [sent. 4290 len. 3]: CHAPTER VIII .
Parsing [sent. 4291 len. 5]: THE STAG 'S HEAD .
Parsing [sent. 4292 len. 15]: Alister went straight to his brother 's room , his heart bursting with indignation .
Parsing [sent. 4293 len. 26]: It was some time before Ian could get the story from him in plain consecution ; every other moment he would diverge into fierce denunciations .
Parsing [sent. 4294 len. 13]: `` Had n't you better tell your master what has happened ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4295 len. 5]: at length said Ian .
Parsing [sent. 4296 len. 16]: `` He ought to know why you curse one of your fellows so bitterly . ''
Parsing [sent. 4297 len. 4]: Alister was dumb .
Parsing [sent. 4298 len. 7]: For a moment he looked aghast .
Parsing [sent. 4299 len. 4]: `` Ian ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4300 len. 13]: he said : `` You think he wants to be told anything ?
Parsing [sent. 4301 len. 10]: I always thought you believed in his divinity ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4302 len. 4]: `` Ah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4303 len. 8]: returned Ian , `` but do you ?
Parsing [sent. 4304 len. 17]: How am I to imagine it , when you go on like that in his hearing ?
Parsing [sent. 4305 len. 9]: Is it so you acknowledge his presence ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4306 len. 5]: `` Oh , Ian !
Parsing [sent. 4307 len. 31]: you do n't know how it tortures me to think of that interloper , the low brute , killing the big stag , the Macruadh stag-and on my land too !
Parsing [sent. 4308 len. 11]: I feel as if I could tear him in pieces .
Parsing [sent. 4309 len. 12]: But for him I would have killed him on the spot !
Parsing [sent. 4310 len. 16]: It is hard if I may not let off my rage even to you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4311 len. 41]: `` Let it off to him , Alister ; he will give you fairer play than your small brother ; he understands you better than I. '' `` But I could not let it off to him that way ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4312 len. 9]: `` Then that is not a good way .
Parsing [sent. 4313 len. 26]: The justice that , even in imagination , would tear and destroy and avenge , may be justice , but it is devil 's justice .
Parsing [sent. 4314 len. 20]: Come , begin now , and tell me all quietly-as if you had read it in a book . ''
Parsing [sent. 4315 len. 12]: `` Word for word , then , with all the imprecations !
Parsing [sent. 4316 len. 18]: `` returned Alister , a little cooler ; and Ian was soon in possession of the story .
Parsing [sent. 4317 len. 10]: `` Now what do you think , Ian ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4318 len. 40]: said the chief , ending a recital true to the very letter , and in a measure calm , but at various points revealing , by the merest dip of the surface , the boiling of the floods beneath .
Parsing [sent. 4319 len. 14]: `` You must send him the head , Alister , '' answered Ian .
Parsing [sent. 4320 len. 10]: `` Send-what-who-I do n't understand you , Ian ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4321 len. 6]: returned the chief , bewildered .
Parsing [sent. 4322 len. 9]: `` Oh , well , never mind ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4323 len. 3]: said Ian .
Parsing [sent. 4324 len. 9]: `` You will think of it presently ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4325 len. 18]: And therewith he turned his face to the wall , as if he would go to sleep .
Parsing [sent. 4326 len. 89]: It had been a thing understood betwixt the brothers , and that from so far back in the golden haze of childhood that the beginning of it was out of sight , that , the moment one of them turned his back , not a word more was to be said , until he who thus dropped the subject , chose to resume it : to break this unspoken compact would have been to break one of the strands in the ancient bond of their most fast brotherhood .
Parsing [sent. 4327 len. 26]: Alister therefore went at once to his room , leaving Ian loving him hard , and praying for him with his face to the wall .
Parsing [sent. 4328 len. 26]: He went as one knowing well the storm he was about to encounter , but never before had he had such a storm to meet .
Parsing [sent. 4329 len. 18]: He closed the door , and sat down on the side of his bed like one stunned .
Parsing [sent. 4330 len. 70]: He did not doubt , yet could hardly allow he believed , that Ian , his oracle , had in verity told him to send the antlers of his cabrach mor , the late live type of his ancient crest , the pride of Clanruadh , to the vile fellow of a Sasunnach who had sent out into the deep the joyous soul of the fierce , bare mountains .
Parsing [sent. 4331 len. 28]: There were rushings to and fro in the spirit of Alister , wild and terrible , even as those in the Valley of the Shadow of Death .
Parsing [sent. 4332 len. 19]: He never closed his eyes , but fought with himself all the night , until the morning broke .
Parsing [sent. 4333 len. 8]: Could this thing be indeed his duty ?
Parsing [sent. 4334 len. 18]: And if not his duty , was he called to do it from mere bravado of goodness ?
Parsing [sent. 4335 len. 14]: How frightfully would not such an action be misunderstood by such a man !
Parsing [sent. 4336 len. 15]: What could he take it for but a mean currying of favour with him !
Parsing [sent. 4337 len. 10]: Why should he move to please such a fellow !
Parsing [sent. 4338 len. 7]: Ian was too hard upon him !
Parsing [sent. 4339 len. 10]: The more he yielded , the more Ian demanded !
Parsing [sent. 4340 len. 10]: Every time it was something harder than the last !
Parsing [sent. 4341 len. 11]: And why did he turn his face to the wall ?
Parsing [sent. 4342 len. 9]: Was he not fit to be argued with !
Parsing [sent. 4343 len. 10]: Was he one that would not listen to reason !
Parsing [sent. 4344 len. 9]: He had never known Ian ungenerous till now !
Parsing [sent. 4345 len. 17]: But all the time there lay at his door a thing calling out to be done !
Parsing [sent. 4346 len. 15]: The thing he did not like was always the thing he had to do !
Parsing [sent. 4347 len. 10]: he grumbled ; but this thing he hated doing !
Parsing [sent. 4348 len. 4]: It was abominable !
Parsing [sent. 4349 len. 2]: What !
Parsing [sent. 4350 len. 35]: send the grand head , with its horns spread wide like a half-moon , and leaning -- like oaks from a precipice -- send it to the man that made it a dead thing !
Parsing [sent. 4351 len. 2]: Never !
Parsing [sent. 4352 len. 7]: It must not be left behind !
Parsing [sent. 4353 len. 11]: It must go to the grave with the fleet limbs !
Parsing [sent. 4354 len. 25]: and over it should rise a monument , at sight of which every friendly highlandman would say , Feiich an cabracli mor de Clanruadli !
Parsing [sent. 4355 len. 28]: What a mockery of fate to be exposed for ever to the vulgar Cockney gaze , the trophy of a fool , whose boast was to kill !
Parsing [sent. 4356 len. 5]: Such a noble beast !
Parsing [sent. 4357 len. 5]: Such a mean man !
Parsing [sent. 4358 len. 14]: To mutilate his remains for the pride of the wretch who killed him !
Parsing [sent. 4359 len. 5]: It was too horrible !
Parsing [sent. 4360 len. 14]: He thought and thought-until at last he lay powerless to think any more .
Parsing [sent. 4361 len. 17]: But it is not always the devil that enters in when a man ceases to think .
Parsing [sent. 4362 len. 3]: God forbid !
Parsing [sent. 4363 len. 16]: The cessation of thought gives opportunity for setting the true soul thinking from another quarter .
Parsing [sent. 4364 len. 16]: Suddenly Alister remembered a conversation he had had with Ian a day or two before .
Parsing [sent. 4365 len. 47]: He had been saying to Ian that he could not understand what Jesus meant when he said , `` Whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek , turn to him the other also ; '' and was dissatisfied with the way Ian had answered him .
Parsing [sent. 4366 len. 12]: `` You must explain it to yourself , '' Ian said .
Parsing [sent. 4367 len. 19]: He replied , `` If I could do that , I should not have to ask you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4368 len. 28]: `` There are many things , '' Ian rejoined , '' -- arithmetic is one -- that can be understood only in the doing of them . ''
Parsing [sent. 4369 len. 13]: `` But how can I do a thing without understanding it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4370 len. 3]: objected Alister .
Parsing [sent. 4371 len. 27]: `` When you have an opportunity of doing this very thing , '' said Ian , `` do it , and see what will follow ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4372 len. 37]: At the time he thought Ian was refusing to come to the point , and was annoyingly indefinite and illogical ; but now it struck him that here was the opportunity of which he had spoken .
Parsing [sent. 4373 len. 5]: `` I see ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4374 len. 5]: he said to himself .
Parsing [sent. 4375 len. 14]: `` It is not want of understanding that is in the way now !
Parsing [sent. 4376 len. 13]: A thing can not look hateful and reasonable at the same moment !
Parsing [sent. 4377 len. 11]: This may be just the sort of thing Jesus meant !
Parsing [sent. 4378 len. 25]: Even if I be in the right , I have a right to yield my right -- and to HIM I will yield it .
Parsing [sent. 4379 len. 22]: That was why Ian turned his face to the wall : he wanted me to discover that here was my opportunity !
Parsing [sent. 4380 len. 27]: How but in the name of Jesus Christ could he have dared tell me to forgive Ruadh 's death by sending his head to his murderer !
Parsing [sent. 4381 len. 6]: It has to be done !
Parsing [sent. 4382 len. 7]: I 've got to do it !
Parsing [sent. 4383 len. 14]: Here is my chance of turning the other cheek and being hurt again !
Parsing [sent. 4384 len. 11]: What can come of it is no business of mine !
Parsing [sent. 4385 len. 11]: To return evil is just to do a fresh evil !
Parsing [sent. 4386 len. 9]: It MAY make the man ashamed of himself !
Parsing [sent. 4387 len. 20]: It can not hurt the stag ; it only hurts my pride , and I owe my pride nothing !
Parsing [sent. 4388 len. 18]: Why should not the fellow have what satisfaction he may -- something to show for his shot !
Parsing [sent. 4389 len. 7]: He shall have the head . ''
Parsing [sent. 4390 len. 28]: Thereupon rushed into his heart the joy of giving up , of deliverance from self ; and pity , to leaven his contempt , awoke for Sercombe .
Parsing [sent. 4391 len. 33]: No sooner had he yielded his pride , than he felt it possible to love the man -- not for anything he was , but for what he might and must be .
Parsing [sent. 4392 len. 23]: `` God let the man kill the stag , '' he said ; `` I will let him have the head . ''
Parsing [sent. 4393 len. 51]: Again and yet again swelled afresh the tide of wrath and unwillingness , making him feel as if he could not carry out his resolve ; but all the time he knew the thing was as good as done -- absolutely determined , so that nothing could turn it aside .
Parsing [sent. 4394 len. 14]: `` To yield where one may , is the prerogative of liberty ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4395 len. 5]: he said to himself .
Parsing [sent. 4396 len. 14]: `` God only can give ; who would be his child must yield !
Parsing [sent. 4397 len. 29]: Abroad in the fields of air , as Paul and the love of God make me hope , what will the wind-battling Ruadh care for his old head !
Parsing [sent. 4398 len. 32]: Would he not say , ` Let the man have it ; my hour was come , or the Some One would not have let him kill me ! ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4399 len. 40]: Thus argued the chief while the darkness endured -- and as soon as the morning began to break , rose , took spade and pick and great knife , and went where Hector and Rob were watching the slain .
Parsing [sent. 4400 len. 5]: It was bitterly cold .
Parsing [sent. 4401 len. 11]: The burn crept silent under a continuous bridge of ice .
Parsing [sent. 4402 len. 7]: The grass-blades were crisp with frost .
Parsing [sent. 4403 len. 11]: The ground was so hard it met iron like iron .
Parsing [sent. 4404 len. 22]: He sent the men to get their breakfast from Nancy : none but himself should do the last offices for Ruadh !
Parsing [sent. 4405 len. 18]: With skilful hand he separated and laid aside the head -- in sacrifice to the living God .
Parsing [sent. 4406 len. 12]: Then the hard earth rang with mighty blows of the pickaxe .
Parsing [sent. 4407 len. 38]: The labour was severe , and long ere the grave was deep enough , Hector and Rob had returned ; but the chief would not get out of it to give them any share in the work .
Parsing [sent. 4408 len. 24]: When he laid hold of the body , they did not offer to help him ; they understood the heart of their chief .
Parsing [sent. 4409 len. 35]: Not without a last pang that he could not lay the head beside it , he began to shovel in the frozen clods , and then at length allowed them to take a part .
Parsing [sent. 4410 len. 20]: When the grave was full , they rolled great stones upon it , that it might not be desecrated .
Parsing [sent. 4411 len. 28]: Then the chief went back to his room , and proceeded to prepare the head , that , as the sacrifice , so should be the gift .
Parsing [sent. 4412 len. 13]: `` I suppose he would like glass eyes , the ruffian ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4413 len. 14]: he muttered to himself , `` but I will not have the mockery .
Parsing [sent. 4414 len. 23]: I will fill the sockets and sew up the eyelids , and the face shall be as of one that sleeps . ''
Parsing [sent. 4415 len. 28]: Haying done all , and written certain directions for temporary treatment , which he tied to an ear , he laid the head aside till the evening .
Parsing [sent. 4416 len. 52]: All the day long , not a word concerning it passed between the brothers ; but when evening came , Alister , with a blue cotton handkerchief in his hand , hiding the head as far as the roots of the huge horns , asked Ian to go for a walk .
Parsing [sent. 4417 len. 8]: They went straight to the New House .
Parsing [sent. 4418 len. 15]: Alister left the head at the door , with his compliments to Mr. Sercombe .
Parsing [sent. 4419 len. 26]: As soon as they were out of sight of the house , Ian put his arm through his brother 's , but did not speak .
Parsing [sent. 4420 len. 11]: `` I know now about turning the other cheek ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4421 len. 4]: said Alister . ''
Parsing [sent. 4422 len. 5]: -- Poor Euadh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4423 len. 21]: `` Leave him to the God that made the great head and nimble feet of him , '' said Ian .
Parsing [sent. 4424 len. 19]: `` A God that did not care for what he had made , how should we believe in !
Parsing [sent. 4425 len. 18]: but he who cares for the dying sparrow , may be trusted with the dead stag . ''
Parsing [sent. 4426 len. 9]: `` Truly , yes , '' returned Alister .
Parsing [sent. 4427 len. 33]: `` Let us sit down , '' said Ian , `` and I will sing you a song I made last night ; I could not sleep after you left me . ''
Parsing [sent. 4428 len. 21]: Without reply , Alister took a stone by the wayside , and Ian one a couple of yards from him .
Parsing [sent. 4429 len. 5]: This was his song .
Parsing [sent. 4430 len. 4]: LOVE 'S HISTORY .
Parsing [sent. 4431 len. 33]: Love , the baby , Toddled out to pluck a flower ; One said , `` No , sir ; '' one said , `` Maybe , At the evening hour ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4432 len. 26]: Love , the boy , Joined the boys and girls at play ; But he left them half his joy Ere the close of day .
Parsing [sent. 4433 len. 26]: Love , the youth , Roamed the country , lightning-laden ; But he hurt himself , and , sooth , Many a man and maiden !
Parsing [sent. 4434 len. 25]: Love , the man , Sought a service all about ; But he would not take their plan , So they cast him out .
Parsing [sent. 4435 len. 24]: Love , the aged , Walking , bowed , the shadeless miles , Bead a volume many-paged , Full of tears and smiles .
Parsing [sent. 4436 len. 25]: Love , the weary , Tottered down the shelving road : At its foot , lo , night the starry Meeting him from God !
Parsing [sent. 4437 len. 7]: `` Love , the holy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4438 len. 23]: Sang a music in her dome , Sang it softly , sang it slowly , '' -- Love is coming home ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4439 len. 26]: Ere the week was out , there stood above the dead stag a growing cairn , to this day called Carn a ' cabrach mor .
Parsing [sent. 4440 len. 16]: It took ten men with levers to roll one of the boulders at its base .
Parsing [sent. 4441 len. 10]: Men still cast stones upon it as they pass .
Parsing [sent. 4442 len. 60]: The next morning came a note to the cottage , in which Sercombe thanked the Macruadh for changing his mind , and said that , although he was indeed glad to have secured such a splendid head , he would certainly have stalked another deer , had he known the chief set such store by the one in question .
Parsing [sent. 4443 len. 44]: It was handed to Alister as he sat at his second breakfast with his mother and Ian : even in winter he was out of the house by six o'clock , to set his men to work , and take his own share .
Parsing [sent. 4444 len. 33]: He read to the end of the first page with curling lip ; the moment he turned the leaf , he sprang from his seat with an exclamation that startled his mother .
Parsing [sent. 4445 len. 4]: `` The hound !
Parsing [sent. 4446 len. 14]: -- I beg my good dogs ' pardon , one and all ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4447 len. 4]: he cried . ''
Parsing [sent. 4448 len. 7]: -- Look at this , Ian !
Parsing [sent. 4449 len. 9]: See what comes of taking your advice ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4450 len. 22]: `` My dear fellow , I gave you no advice that had the least regard to the consequence of following it !
Parsing [sent. 4451 len. 13]: That was the one thing you had nothing to do with . ''
Parsing [sent. 4452 len. 14]: `` READA , '' insisted Alister , as he pranced about the room .
Parsing [sent. 4453 len. 16]: `` No , do n't read the letter ; it 's not worth , reading .
Parsing [sent. 4454 len. 8]: Look at the paper in it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4455 len. 11]: Ian looked , and saw a cheque for ten pounds .
Parsing [sent. 4456 len. 6]: He burst into loud laughter .
Parsing [sent. 4457 len. 6]: `` Poor Ruadh 's horns !
Parsing [sent. 4458 len. 12]: they 're hardly so long as their owner 's ears ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4459 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 4460 len. 7]: `` I told you so ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4461 len. 4]: cried the chief .
Parsing [sent. 4462 len. 5]: `` No , Alister !
Parsing [sent. 4463 len. 8]: You never suspected such a donkey ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4464 len. 8]: `` What is it all about ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4465 len. 4]: asked the mother .
Parsing [sent. 4466 len. 31]: `` The wretch who shot Ruadh , '' replied Alister , '' -- to whom I gave his head , all to please Ian , -- '' `` Alister ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4467 len. 3]: said Ian .
Parsing [sent. 4468 len. 8]: The chief understood , and retracted . ''
Parsing [sent. 4469 len. 26]: -- no , not to please Ian , but to do what Ian showed me was right : -- I believe it was my duty !
Parsing [sent. 4470 len. 6]: -- I hope it was !
Parsing [sent. 4471 len. 14]: -- here 's the murdering fellow sends me a cheque for ten pounds !
Parsing [sent. 4472 len. 18]: -- I told you , Ian , he offered me ten pounds over the dead body ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4473 len. 24]: `` I daresay the poor fellow was sorely puzzled what to do , and appealed to everybody in the house for advice ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4474 len. 16]: `` You take the cheque to represent the combined wisdom of the New House ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4475 len. 9]: `` You must have puzzled them all ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4476 len. 3]: persisted Ian .
Parsing [sent. 4477 len. 19]: `` How could people with no principle beyond that of keeping to a bargain , understand you otherwise !
Parsing [sent. 4478 len. 27]: First , you perform an action such persons think degrading : you carry a fellow 's bag for a shilling , and then himself for nothing !
Parsing [sent. 4479 len. 34]: Next , in the very fury of indignation with a man for killing the finest stag in the country on your meadow , you carry him home the head with your own hands !
Parsing [sent. 4480 len. 18]: It all comes of that unlucky divine motion of yours to do good that good may come !
Parsing [sent. 4481 len. 15]: That shilling of Mistress Conal 's is at the root of it all ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4482 len. 8]: Ian laughed again , and right heartily .
Parsing [sent. 4483 len. 14]: The chief was too angry to enter into the humour of the thing .
Parsing [sent. 4484 len. 14]: `` Upon my word , Ian , it is too bad of you !
Parsing [sent. 4485 len. 6]: What ARE you laughing at ?
Parsing [sent. 4486 len. 14]: It would become you better to tell me what I am to do !
Parsing [sent. 4487 len. 11]: Am I free to break the rascal 's bones ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4488 len. 12]: `` Assuredly not , after that affair with the bag ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4489 len. 7]: `` Oh , damn the bag !
Parsing [sent. 4490 len. 9]: -- I beg your pardon , mother . ''
Parsing [sent. 4491 len. 11]: `` Am I to believe my ears , Alister ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4492 len. 8]: `` What does it matter , mother ?
Parsing [sent. 4493 len. 8]: What harm can it do the bag ?
Parsing [sent. 4494 len. 9]: I wished no evil to any creature ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4495 len. 8]: `` It was the more foolish . ''
Parsing [sent. 4496 len. 7]: `` I grant it , mother .
Parsing [sent. 4497 len. 16]: But you do n't know what a relief it is sometimes to swear a little !
Parsing [sent. 4498 len. 18]: -- You are quite wrong , Ian ; it all comes of giving him the head ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4499 len. 11]: `` You wish you had not given it him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4500 len. 4]: `` No ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4501 len. 9]: growled Alister , as from a pent volcano .
Parsing [sent. 4502 len. 10]: `` You will break my ears , Alister ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4503 len. 21]: cried the mother , unable to keep from laughing at the wrath in which he went straining through the room .
Parsing [sent. 4504 len. 37]: `` Think of it , '' insisted Ian : `` a man like could not think otherwise without a revolution of his whole being to which the change of the leopard 's spots would he nothing .
Parsing [sent. 4505 len. 33]: -- What you meant , after all , was not cordiality ; it was only generosity ; to which his response , his countercheck friendly , was an order for ten pounds !
Parsing [sent. 4506 len. 8]: -- All is right between you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4507 len. 19]: `` Now , really , Ian , you must not go on teasing your elder brother so ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4508 len. 4]: said the mother .
Parsing [sent. 4509 len. 7]: Alister laughed , and ceased fuming .
Parsing [sent. 4510 len. 9]: `` But I must answer the brute ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4511 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 4512 len. 10]: `` What am I to say to him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4513 len. 25]: `` That you are much obliged , '' replied Ian , `` and will have the cheque framed and hung in the hall . ''
Parsing [sent. 4514 len. 5]: `` Come , come !
Parsing [sent. 4515 len. 6]: no more of that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4516 len. 12]: `` Well , then , let me answer the letter . ''
Parsing [sent. 4517 len. 9]: `` That is just what I wanted ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4518 len. 16]: Ian sat down at his mother 's table , and this is what he wrote .
Parsing [sent. 4519 len. 23]: `` Dear sir , -- My brother desires me to return the cheque which you unhappily thought it right to send him .
Parsing [sent. 4520 len. 20]: Humanity is subject to mistake , but I am sorry for the individual who could so misunderstand his courtesy .
Parsing [sent. 4521 len. 17]: I have the honour to remain , sir , your obedient servant , Ian Macruadh . ''
Parsing [sent. 4522 len. 31]: As Ian guessed , the matter had been openly discussed at the New House ; and the money was sent with the approval of all except the two young ladies .
Parsing [sent. 4523 len. 19]: They had seen the young men in circumstances more favourable to the understanding of them by ordinary people .
Parsing [sent. 4524 len. 10]: `` Why did n't the chief write himself ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4525 len. 3]: said Christian .
Parsing [sent. 4526 len. 22]: `` Oh , '' replied Sercombe , `` his little brother had been to school , and could write better ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4527 len. 6]: Christina and Mercy exchanged glances .
Parsing [sent. 4528 len. 26]: `` I will tell you , '' Mercy said , `` why Mr. lau answered the note : the chief had done with you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4529 len. 25]: `` Or , '' suggested Christina , `` the chief was in such a rage that he would write nothing but a challenge . ''
Parsing [sent. 4530 len. 8]: `` I wish to goodness he had !
Parsing [sent. 4531 len. 15]: It would have given me the chance of giving the clodhopper a lesson . ''
Parsing [sent. 4532 len. 16]: `` For sending you the finest stag 's head and horns in the country ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4533 len. 3]: remarked Mercy .
Parsing [sent. 4534 len. 6]: `` I shot the stag !
Parsing [sent. 4535 len. 10]: Perhaps you do n't believe I shot him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4536 len. 5]: `` Indeed I do !
Parsing [sent. 4537 len. 8]: No one else would have done it .
Parsing [sent. 4538 len. 8]: The chief would have died sooner ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4539 len. 9]: `` I 'm sick of your chief ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4540 len. 3]: said Christian .
Parsing [sent. 4541 len. 11]: `` A pretty chief without a penny to bless himself !
Parsing [sent. 4542 len. 13]: A chief , and glad of the job of carrying a carpet-bag !
Parsing [sent. 4543 len. 11]: You 'll be calling him MY LORD , next ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4544 len. 18]: `` He may at least write BARONET after his name when he pleases , '' returned Mercy .
Parsing [sent. 4545 len. 7]: `` Why do n't he then ?
Parsing [sent. 4546 len. 5]: A likely story ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4547 len. 24]: `` Because , '' answered Christina , `` both his father and himself were ashamed of how the first baronet got his title .
Parsing [sent. 4548 len. 29]: It had to do with the sale of a part of the property , and they counted the land the clan 's as well as the chief 's .
Parsing [sent. 4549 len. 33]: They regarded it as an act of treachery to put the clan in the power of a stranger , and the chief looks on the title as a brand of shame . ''
Parsing [sent. 4550 len. 12]: `` I do n't question the treachery , '' said Christian .
Parsing [sent. 4551 len. 7]: `` A highlander is treacherous . ''
Parsing [sent. 4552 len. 38]: Christina had asked a friend in Glasgow to find out for her anything known among the lawyers concerning the Macruadhs , and what she had just recounted was a part of the information she had thereby received .
Parsing [sent. 4553 len. 7]: Thenceforward silence covered the whole transaction .
Parsing [sent. 4554 len. 15]: Sercombe neither returned the head , sent an apology , nor recognized the gift .
Parsing [sent. 4555 len. 9]: That he had shot the stag was enough !
Parsing [sent. 4556 len. 39]: But these things wrought shaping the idea of the brothers in the minds of the sisters , and they were beginning to feel a strange confidence in them , such as they had never had in men before .
Parsing [sent. 4557 len. 23]: A curious little halo began to shimmer about the heads of the young men in the picture-gallery of the girls ' fancy .
Parsing [sent. 4558 len. 33]: Not the less , however , did they regard them as enthusiasts , unfitted to this world , incapable of self-protection , too good to live -- in a word , unpractical !
Parsing [sent. 4559 len. 35]: Because a man would live according to the laws of his being as well as of his body , obeying simple , imperative , essential human necessity , his fellows forsooth call him UNPRACTICAL !
Parsing [sent. 4560 len. 22]: Of the idiotic delusions of the children of this world , that of being practical is one of the most ludicrous .
Parsing [sent. 4561 len. 17]: Here is a translation , made by Ian , of one of Alister 's Gaelic songs .
Parsing [sent. 4562 len. 5]: THE SUN 'S DAUGHTER .
Parsing [sent. 4563 len. 46]: A bright drop of water In the gold tire Of a sun 's daughter Was laughing to her sire ; And from all the flowers about , That never toiled or spun , The soul of each looked out , Clear laughing to the sun .
Parsing [sent. 4564 len. 9]: I saw them unfolding Their hearts every one !
Parsing [sent. 4565 len. 8]: Every soul holding Within it the sun !
Parsing [sent. 4566 len. 20]: But all the sun-mirrors Vanished anon ; And their flowers , mere starers , Grew dry in the sun .
Parsing [sent. 4567 len. 11]: `` My soul is but water , Shining and gone !
Parsing [sent. 4568 len. 16]: She is but the daughter , '' I said , `` of the sun ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4569 len. 72]: My soul sat her down In a deep-shaded gloom ; Her glory was flown , Her earth was a tomb , Till night came and caught her , And then out she shone ; And I knew her no daughter Of that shining sun -- Till night came down and taught her Of a glory yet unknown ; And I knew my soul the daughter Of a sun behind the sun .
Parsing [sent. 4570 len. 30]: Back , back to him that wrought her My soul shall haste and run ; Straight back to him , his daughter , To the sun behind the sun .
Parsing [sent. 4571 len. 3]: CHAPTER IX .
Parsing [sent. 4572 len. 5]: ANNIE OF THE SHOP .
Parsing [sent. 4573 len. 26]: At the dance in the chief 's barn , Sercombe had paired with Annie of the shop oftener than with any other of the girls .
Parsing [sent. 4574 len. 53]: That she should please him at all , was something in his favour , for she was a simple , modest girl , with the nicest feeling of the laws of intercourse , the keenest perception both of what is in itself right , and what is becoming in the commonest relation .
Parsing [sent. 4575 len. 31]: She understood by a fine moral instinct what respect was due to her , and what respect she ought to show , and was therefore in the truest sense well-bred .
Parsing [sent. 4576 len. 50]: There are women whom no change of circumstances would cause to alter even their manners a hair 's - breadth : such are God 's ladies ; there are others in whom any outward change will reveal the vulgarity of a nature more conscious of claim than of obligation .
Parsing [sent. 4577 len. 22]: I need not say that Sercomhe , though a man of what is called education , was but conventionally a gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 4578 len. 32]: If in doubt whether a man be a gentleman or not , hear him speak to a woman he regards as his inferior : his very tone will probably betray him .
Parsing [sent. 4579 len. 17]: A true gentleman , that is a true man , will be the more carefully respectful .
Parsing [sent. 4580 len. 34]: Sercombe was one of those who regard themselves as respectable because they are prudent ; whether they are human , and their brother and sister 's keeper , they have never asked themselves .
Parsing [sent. 4581 len. 18]: To some minds neither innocent nor simple , there is yet something attractive in innocence and simplicity .
Parsing [sent. 4582 len. 49]: Perhaps it gives them a pleasing sense of their superiority -- a background against which to rejoice in their liberty , while their pleasure in it helps to obscure the gulf between what the man would fain hold himself to be , and what in reality he is .
Parsing [sent. 4583 len. 47]: There is no spectre so terrible as the unsuspected spectre of a man 's own self ; it is noisome enough to the man who is ever trying to better it : what must it appear to the man who sees it for the first time !
Parsing [sent. 4584 len. 21]: Sercombe 's self was ugly , and he did not know it ; he thought himself an exceptionally fine fellow .
Parsing [sent. 4585 len. 21]: No one knows what a poor creature he is but the man who makes it his business to be true .
Parsing [sent. 4586 len. 23]: The only mistake worse than thinking well of himself , is for a man to think God takes no interest in him .
Parsing [sent. 4587 len. 25]: One evening , sorely in lack of amusement , Sercombe wandered out into a star-lit night , and along the road to the village .
Parsing [sent. 4588 len. 15]: There he went into the general shop , where sat Annie behind the counter .
Parsing [sent. 4589 len. 66]: Now the first attention he almost always paid a woman , that is when he cared and dared , was a compliment -- the fungus of an empty head or a false heart ; but with Annie he took no such initiative liberty , and she , accustomed to respectful familiarity from the chief and his brother , showed no repugnance to his friendly approach .
Parsing [sent. 4590 len. 31]: `` Upon my word , Miss Annie , '' said Sercombe , venturing at length a little , `` you were the best dancer on the floor that night ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4591 len. 6]: `` Oh , Mr. Sercombe !
Parsing [sent. 4592 len. 18]: how can you say so -- with such dancers as the young ladies of your party ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4593 len. 3]: returned Annie .
Parsing [sent. 4594 len. 18]: `` They dance well , '' he returned , `` but not so well as you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4595 len. 18]: `` It all depends on the dance -- whether you are used to it or not . ''
Parsing [sent. 4596 len. 6]: `` No , by Jove !
Parsing [sent. 4597 len. 31]: If you had a lesson or two such as they have been having all their lives , you would dance out of their sight in the twinkling of an eye .
Parsing [sent. 4598 len. 36]: If I had you for a partner every night for a month , you would dance better than any woman I have ever seen -- off the stage -- any lady , that is . ''
Parsing [sent. 4599 len. 15]: The grosser the flattery , the surer with a country girl , he thought .
Parsing [sent. 4600 len. 34]: But there was that in his tone , besides the freedom of sounding her praises in her own ears , which was unpleasing to Annie 's ladyhood , and she held her peace .
Parsing [sent. 4601 len. 13]: `` Come out and have a turn , '' he said thereupon .
Parsing [sent. 4602 len. 6]: `` It is lovely star-light .
Parsing [sent. 4603 len. 8]: Have you had a walk to-day ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4604 len. 19]: `` No , I have not , '' answered Annie , casting how to get rid of him .
Parsing [sent. 4605 len. 12]: `` You wrong your beauty by keeping to the house . ''
Parsing [sent. 4606 len. 35]: `` My beauty , '' said Annie , flushing , `` may look after itself ; I have nothing to do with it -- neither , excuse me , sir , have you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4607 len. 14]: `` Why , who has a right to be offended with the truth !
Parsing [sent. 4608 len. 32]: A man ca n't help seeing your face is as sweet as your voice , and your figure , as revealed by your dancing , a match for the two ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4609 len. 16]: `` I will call my mother , '' said Annie , and left the shop .
Parsing [sent. 4610 len. 10]: Sercombe did not believe she would , and waited .
Parsing [sent. 4611 len. 9]: He took her departure for a mere coquetry .
Parsing [sent. 4612 len. 32]: But when a rather grim , handsome old woman appeared , asking him -- it took the most of her English -- `` What would you be wanting , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4613 len. 16]: as if he had just come into the shop , he found himself awkwardly situated .
Parsing [sent. 4614 len. 66]: He answered , with more than his usual politeness , that , having had the pleasure of dancing with her daughter at the chief 's hall , he had taken the liberty of looking in to inquire after her health ; whereupon , perplexed , the old woman in her turn called Annie , who came at once , but kept close to her mother .
Parsing [sent. 4615 len. 39]: Sercombe began to tell them about a tour he had made in Canada , for he had heard they had friends there ; but the mother did not understand him , and Annie more and more disliked him .
Parsing [sent. 4616 len. 40]: He soon saw that at least he had better say nothing more about a walk , and took himself off , not a little piqued at repulse from a peasant-girl in the most miserable shop he had ever entered .
Parsing [sent. 4617 len. 14]: Two days after , he went again -- this time to buy tobacco .
Parsing [sent. 4618 len. 33]: Annie was short with him , but he went yet again and yet sooner : these primitive people objected to strangers , he said ; accustomed to him she would be friendly !
Parsing [sent. 4619 len. 15]: he would not rest until he had gained some footing of favour with her !
Parsing [sent. 4620 len. 8]: Annie grew heartily offended with the man .
Parsing [sent. 4621 len. 31]: She also feared what might be said if he kept coming to the shop -- where Mistress Conal had seen him more than once , and looked poison at him .
Parsing [sent. 4622 len. 35]: For her own sake , for the sake of Lachlan , and for the sake of the chief , she resolved to make the young father of the ancient clan acquainted with her trouble .
Parsing [sent. 4623 len. 26]: It was on the day after his rejection of the ten-pound note that she found her opportunity , for the chief came to see her .
Parsing [sent. 4624 len. 10]: `` Was he rude to you , Annie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4625 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 4626 len. 22]: `` No , sir -- too polite , I think : he must have seen I did not want his company .
Parsing [sent. 4627 len. 10]: -- I shall feel happier now you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 4628 len. 12]: `` I will see to it , '' said the chief .
Parsing [sent. 4629 len. 15]: `` I hope it will not put you to any trouble , sir ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4630 len. 9]: `` What am I here for , Annie !
Parsing [sent. 4631 len. 6]: Are you not my clanswoman !
Parsing [sent. 4632 len. 6]: Is not Lachlan my foster-brother !
Parsing [sent. 4633 len. 12]: -- He will trouble you no more , I think . ''
Parsing [sent. 4634 len. 51]: As Alister walked home , he met Sercombe , and after a greeting not very cordial on either side , said thus : `` I should be obliged to you , Mr. Sercombe , if you would send for anything you want , instead of going to the shop yourself .
Parsing [sent. 4635 len. 28]: Annie Macruadh is not the sort of girl you may have found in such a position , and you would not wish to make her uncomfortable ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4636 len. 30]: Sercombe was , ashamed , I think ; for the refuge of the fool when dissatisfied with himself , is offence with his neighbour , and Sercombe was angry .
Parsing [sent. 4637 len. 11]: `` Are you her father -- or her lover ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4638 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 4639 len. 18]: `` She has a right to my protection -- and claims it , '' rejoined Alister quietly .
Parsing [sent. 4640 len. 3]: `` Protection !
Parsing [sent. 4641 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 4642 len. 11]: -- What the devil would you protect her from ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4643 len. 8]: `` From you , Mr. Sercombe . ''
Parsing [sent. 4644 len. 7]: `` Protect her , then . ''
Parsing [sent. 4645 len. 4]: `` I will .
Parsing [sent. 4646 len. 20]: Force yourself on that young woman 's notice again , and you will have to do with me . ''
Parsing [sent. 4647 len. 3]: They parted .
Parsing [sent. 4648 len. 4]: Alister went home .
Parsing [sent. 4649 len. 7]: Sercombe went straight to the shop .
Parsing [sent. 4650 len. 49]: He was doing what he could to recommend himself to Christina ; but whether from something antagonistic between them , or from unwillingness on her part to yield her position of advantage and so her liberty , she had not given him the encouragement he thought he deserved .
Parsing [sent. 4651 len. 29]: He believed himself in love with her , and had told her so ; but the truest love such a man can feel , is a poor thing .
Parsing [sent. 4652 len. 23]: He admired , and desired , and thought he loved her beauty , and that he called being in love with HER !
Parsing [sent. 4653 len. 28]: He did not think much about her money , but had she then been brought to poverty , he would at least have hesitated about marrying her .
Parsing [sent. 4654 len. 38]: In the family he was regarded as her affianced , although she did not treat him as such , but merely went on bewitching him , pleased that at least he was a man of the world .
Parsing [sent. 4655 len. 47]: While one is yet only IN LOVE , the real person , the love-capable , lies covered with the rose-leaves of a thousand sleepy-eyed dreams , and through them come to the dreamer but the barest hints of the real person of whom is the dream .
Parsing [sent. 4656 len. 35]: A thousand fancies fly out , approach , and cross , but never meet ; the man and the woman are pleased , not with each other , but each with the fancied other .
Parsing [sent. 4657 len. 68]: The merest common likings are taken for signs of a wonderful sympathy , of a radical unity -- of essential capacity , therefore , of loving and being loved ; at a hundred points their souls seem to touch , but their contacts are the merest brushings as of insect-antennae ; the real man , the real woman , is all the time asleep under the rose-leaves .
Parsing [sent. 4658 len. 45]: Happy is the rare fate of the true -- to wake and come forth and meet in the majesty of the truth , in the image of God , in their very being , in the power of that love which alone is being .
Parsing [sent. 4659 len. 38]: They love , not this and that about each other , but each the very other -- a love as essential to reality , to truth , to religion , as the love of the very God .
Parsing [sent. 4660 len. 30]: Where such love is , let the differences of taste , the unfitnesses of temperament be what they may , the two must by and by be thoroughly one .
Parsing [sent. 4661 len. 18]: Sercombe saw no reason why a gentleman should not amuse himself with any young woman he pleased .
Parsing [sent. 4662 len. 7]: What was the chief to him !
Parsing [sent. 4663 len. 6]: He was not his chief !
Parsing [sent. 4664 len. 25]: If he was a big man in the eyes of his little clan , he was nothing much in the eyes of Hilary Sercombe .
Parsing [sent. 4665 len. 5]: CHAPTER X THE ENCOUNTER .
Parsing [sent. 4666 len. 18]: Annie came again to her chief , with the complaint that Mr. Sercombe persisted in his attentions .
Parsing [sent. 4667 len. 7]: Alister went to see her home .
Parsing [sent. 4668 len. 13]: They had not gone far when Sercombe overtook them , and passed .
Parsing [sent. 4669 len. 28]: The chief told Annie to go on , and called after him , `` I must have a word or two with you , Mr. Sercombe ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4670 len. 15]: He turned and came up with long steps , his hands in his coat-pockets .
Parsing [sent. 4671 len. 11]: `` I warned you to leave that girl alone ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4672 len. 4]: said the chief .
Parsing [sent. 4673 len. 18]: `` And I warn you now , '' rejoined Sercombe , `` to leave me alone ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4674 len. 11]: `` I am bound to take care of her . ''
Parsing [sent. 4675 len. 7]: `` And I of myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 4676 len. 7]: `` Not at her expense ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4677 len. 6]: `` At yours then ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4678 len. 24]: answered Sercombe , provoking an encounter , to which he was the more inclined that he saw Ian coming slowly up the ridge .
Parsing [sent. 4679 len. 16]: `` It was your deliberate intention then to forget the caution I gave you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4680 len. 8]: said the chief , restraining his anger .
Parsing [sent. 4681 len. 16]: `` I make a point of forgetting what I do not think worth remembering . ''
Parsing [sent. 4682 len. 6]: `` I forget nothing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4683 len. 6]: `` I congratulate you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4684 len. 13]: `` And I mean to assist your memory , Mr. Sercombe . ''
Parsing [sent. 4685 len. 5]: `` Mr. Macruadh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4686 len. 44]: returned Sercombe , `` if you expect me not to open my lips to any hussy in the glen without your leave , -- '' His speech was cut short by a box on the ear from the open hand of the chief .
Parsing [sent. 4687 len. 25]: He would not use his fist without warning , but such a word applied to any honest woman of his clan demanded instant recognition .
Parsing [sent. 4688 len. 23]: Sercomhe fell back a step , white with rage , then darting forward , struck straight at the front of his adversary .
Parsing [sent. 4689 len. 19]: Alister avoided the blow , but soon found himself a mere child at such play with the Englishman .
Parsing [sent. 4690 len. 19]: He had not again touched Sercombe , and was himself bleeding fast , when Ian came up running .
Parsing [sent. 4691 len. 4]: `` Damn you !
Parsing [sent. 4692 len. 4]: come on ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4693 len. 18]: cried Sercombe when he saw him ; `` I can do the precious pair of you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4694 len. 4]: `` Stop ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4695 len. 27]: cried Ian , laying hold of his brother from behind , pinning his arms to his sides , wheeling him round , and taking his place .
Parsing [sent. 4696 len. 11]: `` Give over , Alister , '' he went on .
Parsing [sent. 4697 len. 22]: `` You ca n't do it , and I wo n't see you punished when it is he that deserves it .
Parsing [sent. 4698 len. 10]: Go and sit there , and look on . ''
Parsing [sent. 4699 len. 10]: `` YOU ca n't do it , Ian ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4700 len. 3]: returned Alister .
Parsing [sent. 4701 len. 6]: `` It is my business .
Parsing [sent. 4702 len. 6]: One blow in will serve .
Parsing [sent. 4703 len. 14]: He jumps about like a goat that I ca n't hit him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4704 len. 8]: `` You are blind with blood ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4705 len. 16]: said Ian , in a tone that gave Sercombe expectation of too easy a victory .
Parsing [sent. 4706 len. 10]: `` Sit down there , I tell you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4707 len. 10]: `` Mind , I do n't give in ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4708 len. 13]: said Alister , but turning went to the bank at the roadside .
Parsing [sent. 4709 len. 19]: `` If he speak once again to Annie , I swear I will make him repent it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4710 len. 4]: Sercombe laughed insultingly .
Parsing [sent. 4711 len. 20]: `` Mr. Sercombe , '' said Ian , `` had we not better put off our bout till to-morrow ?
Parsing [sent. 4712 len. 6]: You have fought already ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4713 len. 11]: `` Damn you for a coward , come on ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4714 len. 14]: `` Would you not like to take your breath for a moment ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4715 len. 11]: `` I have all I am likely to need . ''
Parsing [sent. 4716 len. 30]: `` It is only fair , '' persisted Ian , `` to warn you that you will not find my knowledge on the level of my brother 's ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4717 len. 15]: `` Shut up , '' said Sercombe savagely , `` and come on . ''
Parsing [sent. 4718 len. 28]: For a few rounds Ian seemed to Alister to be giving Sercombe time to recover his wind ; to Sercombe he seemed to be saving his own .
Parsing [sent. 4719 len. 15]: He stood to defend , and did not attempt to put in a blow .
Parsing [sent. 4720 len. 23]: `` Mr. Sercombe , '' he said at length , `` you can not serve me as you did my brother . ''
Parsing [sent. 4721 len. 7]: `` I see that well enough .
Parsing [sent. 4722 len. 4]: Come on ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4723 len. 15]: `` Will you give your word to leave Annie of the shop alone ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4724 len. 7]: Sercombe answered with a scornful imprecation .
Parsing [sent. 4725 len. 15]: `` I warn you again , I am no novice in this business ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4726 len. 3]: said Ian .
Parsing [sent. 4727 len. 11]: Sercombe struck out , but did not reach his antagonist .
Parsing [sent. 4728 len. 8]: The fight lasted but a moment longer .
Parsing [sent. 4729 len. 33]: As his adversary drew back from a failed blow , Alister saw Ian 's eyes flash , and his left arm shoot out , as it seemed , to twice its length .
Parsing [sent. 4730 len. 13]: Sercombe neither reeled nor staggered but fell supine , and lay motionless .
Parsing [sent. 4731 len. 10]: The brothers were by his side in a moment .
Parsing [sent. 4732 len. 7]: `` I struck too hard ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4733 len. 3]: said Ian .
Parsing [sent. 4734 len. 11]: `` Who can think about that in a fight ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4735 len. 3]: returned Alister .
Parsing [sent. 4736 len. 15]: `` I could have helped it well enough , and a better man would .
Parsing [sent. 4737 len. 25]: Something shot through me -- I hope it was n't hatred ; I am sure it was anger -- and the man went down !
Parsing [sent. 4738 len. 9]: What if the devil struck the blow ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4739 len. 6]: `` Nonsense , Ian ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4740 len. 14]: said Alister , as they raised Sercombe to carry him to the cottage .
Parsing [sent. 4741 len. 14]: `` It was pure indignation , and nothing to blame in it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4742 len. 11]: `` I wish I could be sure of that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4743 len. 13]: They had not gone far before he began to come to himself .
Parsing [sent. 4744 len. 7]: `` What are you about ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4745 len. 6]: he said feebly but angrily .
Parsing [sent. 4746 len. 6]: `` Set me down . ''
Parsing [sent. 4747 len. 4]: They did so .
Parsing [sent. 4748 len. 12]: He staggered to the road-side , and leaned against the bank .
Parsing [sent. 4749 len. 8]: `` What 's been the row ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4750 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 4751 len. 6]: `` Oh , I remember !
Parsing [sent. 4752 len. 12]: -- Well , you 've had the best of it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4753 len. 20]: He held out his hand in a vague sort of way , and the gesture invaded their soft hearts .
Parsing [sent. 4754 len. 5]: Each took the hand .
Parsing [sent. 4755 len. 14]: `` I was all right about the girl though , '' said Sercombe .
Parsing [sent. 4756 len. 10]: `` I did n't mean her any harm . ''
Parsing [sent. 4757 len. 33]: `` I do n't think you did , '' answered Alister ; `` and I am sure you could have done her none ; but the girl did not like it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4758 len. 27]: `` There is not a girl of the clan , or in the neighbourhood , for whom my brother would not have done the same . ''
Parsing [sent. 4759 len. 3]: said Ian .
Parsing [sent. 4760 len. 9]: `` You 're a brace of woodcocks ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4761 len. 3]: cried Sercombe .
Parsing [sent. 4762 len. 12]: `` It 's well you 're not out in the world .
Parsing [sent. 4763 len. 11]: You would be in hot water from morning to night !
Parsing [sent. 4764 len. 14]: I ca n't think how the devil you get on at all ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4765 len. 4]: `` Get on !
Parsing [sent. 4766 len. 3]: Where ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4767 len. 6]: asked Ian with a smile .
Parsing [sent. 4768 len. 4]: `` Come now !
Parsing [sent. 4769 len. 11]: You ai n't such fools as you want to look !
Parsing [sent. 4770 len. 14]: A man must make a place for himself somehow in the world ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4771 len. 13]: He rose , and they walked in the direction of the cottage .
Parsing [sent. 4772 len. 13]: `` There is a better thing than that , '' said Ian !
Parsing [sent. 4773 len. 4]: `` What ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4774 len. 9]: `` To get clean out of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4775 len. 3]: `` What !
Parsing [sent. 4776 len. 5]: cut your throats ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4777 len. 21]: `` I meant that to get out of the world clean was better than to get on in it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4778 len. 7]: `` I do n't understand you .
Parsing [sent. 4779 len. 16]: I do n't choose to think the man that thrashed me a downright idiot ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4780 len. 3]: growled Sercombe .
Parsing [sent. 4781 len. 19]: `` What you call getting on , '' rejoined Ian , `` we count not worth a thought .
Parsing [sent. 4782 len. 5]: Look at our clan !
Parsing [sent. 4783 len. 9]: it is a type of the world itself .
Parsing [sent. 4784 len. 5]: Everything is passing away .
Parsing [sent. 4785 len. 9]: We believe in the kingdom of heaven . ''
Parsing [sent. 4786 len. 5]: `` Come , come !
Parsing [sent. 4787 len. 12]: fellows like you must know well enough that 's all bosh !
Parsing [sent. 4788 len. 13]: Nobody nowadays -- nobody with any brains -- believes such rot ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4789 len. 33]: `` We believe in Jesus Christ , '' said Ian , `` and are determined to do what he will have us do , and take our orders from nobody else . ''
Parsing [sent. 4790 len. 8]: `` I do n't understand you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4791 len. 7]: `` I know you do n't .
Parsing [sent. 4792 len. 15]: You can not until you set about changing your whole way of life . ''
Parsing [sent. 4793 len. 6]: `` Oh , be damned !
Parsing [sent. 4794 len. 4]: what an idea !
Parsing [sent. 4795 len. 7]: a sneaking , impossible idea ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4796 len. 18]: `` As to its being an impossible idea , we hold it , and live by it .
Parsing [sent. 4797 len. 12]: How absurd it must seem to you , I know perfectly .
Parsing [sent. 4798 len. 22]: But we do n't live in your world , and you do not even see the lights of ours . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 4799 len. 10]: ` There is a world beyond the stars ' !
Parsing [sent. 4800 len. 34]: -- Well , there may be ; I know nothing about it ; I only know there is one on this side of them , -- a very decent sort of world too !
Parsing [sent. 4801 len. 10]: I mean to make the best of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4802 len. 8]: `` And have not begun yet ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4803 len. 5]: `` Indeed I have !
Parsing [sent. 4804 len. 5]: I deny myself nothing .
Parsing [sent. 4805 len. 10]: I live as I was made to live . ''
Parsing [sent. 4806 len. 29]: `` If you were not made to obey your conscience or despise yourself , you are differently made from us , and no communication is possible between us .
Parsing [sent. 4807 len. 18]: We must wait until what differences a man from a beast make its appearance in you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4808 len. 6]: `` You are polite ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4809 len. 19]: `` You have spoken of us as you think ; now we speak of you as we think .
Parsing [sent. 4810 len. 28]: Taking your representation of yourself , you are in the condition of the lower animals , for you claim inclination as the law of your life . ''
Parsing [sent. 4811 len. 10]: `` My beast is better than your man ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4812 len. 13]: `` You mean you get more of the good of life ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4813 len. 3]: `` Right !
Parsing [sent. 4814 len. 4]: I do . ''
Parsing [sent. 4815 len. 8]: The brothers exchanged a look and smile .
Parsing [sent. 4816 len. 24]: `` But suppose , '' resumed Ian , `` the man we have found in us should one day wake up in you !
Parsing [sent. 4817 len. 17]: Suppose he should say , ` Why did you make a beast of me ? ' !
Parsing [sent. 4818 len. 12]: It will not be easy for you to answer him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4819 len. 6]: `` That 's all moonshine !
Parsing [sent. 4820 len. 8]: Things are as you take them . ''
Parsing [sent. 4821 len. 27]: `` So said Lady Macbeth till she took to walking in her sleep , and could n't get rid of the smell of the blood ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4822 len. 5]: Sercombe said no more .
Parsing [sent. 4823 len. 12]: He was silent with disgust at the nonsense of it all .
Parsing [sent. 4824 len. 8]: They reached the door of the cottage .
Parsing [sent. 4825 len. 7]: Alister invited him to walk in .
Parsing [sent. 4826 len. 10]: He drew back , and would have excused himself .
Parsing [sent. 4827 len. 13]: `` You had better lie down a while , '' said Alister .
Parsing [sent. 4828 len. 12]: `` You shall come to my room , '' said Ian .
Parsing [sent. 4829 len. 7]: `` We shall meet nobody . ''
Parsing [sent. 4830 len. 8]: Sercombe yielded , for he felt queer .
Parsing [sent. 4831 len. 17]: He threw himself on Ian 's bed , and in a few minutes was fast asleep .
Parsing [sent. 4832 len. 18]: When he woke , he had a cup of tea , and went away little the worse .
Parsing [sent. 4833 len. 10]: The laird could not show himself for several days .
Parsing [sent. 4834 len. 8]: After this Annie had no further molestation .
Parsing [sent. 4835 len. 42]: But indeed the young men 's time was almost up -- which was quite as well , for Annie of the shop , after turning a corner of the road , had climbed the hill-side , and seen all that passed .
Parsing [sent. 4836 len. 30]: The young ladies , hearing contradictory statements , called upon Annie to learn the truth , and the intercourse with her that followed was not without influence on them .
Parsing [sent. 4837 len. 42]: Through Annie they saw further into the character of the brothers , who , if they advocated things too fine for the world the girls had hitherto known , DID things also of which it would by no means have approved .
Parsing [sent. 4838 len. 11]: They valued that world and its judgment not a straw !
Parsing [sent. 4839 len. 3]: CHAPTER XI .
Parsing [sent. 4840 len. 3]: A LESSON .
Parsing [sent. 4841 len. 32]: All the gentlemen at the New House left it together , and its ladies were once more abandoned to the society of Nature , who said little to any of them .
Parsing [sent. 4842 len. 30]: For , though she recognized her grandchildren , and did what she could for them , it was now time they should make some move towards acquaintance with her .
Parsing [sent. 4843 len. 16]: A point comes when she must stand upon her dignity , for it is great .
Parsing [sent. 4844 len. 38]: If you would hear her wonderful tales , or see her marvellous treasures , you must not trifle with her ; you must not talk as if you could rummage her drawers and cahinets as you pleased .
Parsing [sent. 4845 len. 38]: You must believe in her ; you must reverence her ; else , although she is everywhere about the house , you may not meet her from the beginning of one year to the end of another .
Parsing [sent. 4846 len. 50]: To allude to any aspect of nature in the presence of the girls was to threaten to bore them ; and I heartily confess to being bored myself with common talk about scenery ; but these ladies appeared unaware of the least expression on the face of their grand-mother .
Parsing [sent. 4847 len. 50]: Doubtless they received some good from the aspect of things -- that they could not help ; there Grannie 's hidden , and therefore irresistible power was in operation ; but the moment they had their thoughts directed to the world around them , they began to gape inwardly .
Parsing [sent. 4848 len. 36]: Even the trumpet and shawm of her winds , the stately march of her clouds , and the torrent-rush of her waters , were to them poor facts , no vaguest embodiment of truths eternal .
Parsing [sent. 4849 len. 21]: It was small wonder then that verse of any worth should be to them but sounding brass and clanging cymbals .
Parsing [sent. 4850 len. 35]: What they called society , its ways and judgments , its decrees and condemnations , its fashions and pomps and shows , false , unjust , ugly , was nearly all they cared for .
Parsing [sent. 4851 len. 24]: The truth of things , without care for which man or woman is the merest puppet , had hitherto been nothing to them .
Parsing [sent. 4852 len. 7]: To talk of Nature was sentimental .
Parsing [sent. 4853 len. 10]: To talk of God was both irreverent and ill-bred .
Parsing [sent. 4854 len. 12]: Wordsworth was an old woman ; St. Paul an evangelical churchman .
Parsing [sent. 4855 len. 30]: They saw no feature of any truth , but , like all unthinkers , wrapped the words of it in their own foolishness , and then sneered at them .
Parsing [sent. 4856 len. 31]: They were too much of ladies , however , to do it disagreeably ; they only smiled at the foolish neighbour who believed things they were too sensible to believe .
Parsing [sent. 4857 len. 25]: It must , however , be said for them , that they had not yet refused anything worth believing -- as presented to them .
Parsing [sent. 4858 len. 13]: They had not yet actually looked upon any truth and refused it .
Parsing [sent. 4859 len. 21]: They were indeed not yet true enough in themselves to suspect the presence of either a truth or a falsehood .
Parsing [sent. 4860 len. 23]: A thaw came , and the ways were bad , and they found the time hang yet heavier on their unaided hands .
Parsing [sent. 4861 len. 34]: An intercourse by degrees established itself between Mrs. Macruadh and the well-meaning , handsome , smiling Mrs. Palmer , and rendered it natural for the girls to go rather frequently to the cottage .
Parsing [sent. 4862 len. 21]: They made themselves agreeable to the mother , and subject to the law of her presence showed to better advantage .
Parsing [sent. 4863 len. 85]: With their love of literature , it was natural also that the young men should at such times not only talk about books , but occasionally read for their entertainment from some favourite one ; so that now , for the first time in their lives , the young ladies were brought under direct teaching of a worthy sort -- they had had but a mockery of it at school and church -- and a little light began to soak through their unseeking eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4864 len. 69]: Among many others , however , less manifest , one obstruction to their progress lay in the fact that Christina , whose percep in some directions was quick enough , would always make a dart at the comical side of anything that could be comically turned , so disturbing upon occasion the whole spiritual atmosphere about some delicate epiphany : this to both Alister and Ian was unbearable .
Parsing [sent. 4865 len. 26]: She offended chiefly in respect of Wordsworth -- who had not humour enough always to perceive what seriously meant expression might suggest a ludicrous idea .
Parsing [sent. 4866 len. 44]: One time , reading from the Excursion , Ian came to the verse -- not to be found , I think , in later editions -- `` Perhaps it is not he but some one else '' : -- `` Awful idea ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4867 len. 15]: exclaimed Christina , with sepulchral tone ; '' -- ` some one else ! '
Parsing [sent. 4868 len. 4]: Think of it !
Parsing [sent. 4869 len. 5]: It makes me shudder !
Parsing [sent. 4870 len. 8]: Who might it not have been ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4871 len. 14]: Ian closed the book , and persistently refused to read more that day .
Parsing [sent. 4872 len. 46]: Another time he was reading , in illustration of something , Wordsworth 's poem , `` To a Skylark , '' the earlier of the two with that title : when he came to the unfortunate line , -- `` Happy , happy liver ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4873 len. 12]: -- `` Oh , I am glad to know that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4874 len. 3]: cried Christina .
Parsing [sent. 4875 len. 20]: `` I always thought the poor lark must have a bad digestion -- he was up so early ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4876 len. 12]: Ian refused to finish the poem , although Mercy begged hard .
Parsing [sent. 4877 len. 52]: The next time they came , he proposed to `` read something in Miss Palmer 's style , '' and taking up a volume of Hood , and avoiding both his serious and the best of his comic poems , turned to two or three of the worst he could find .
Parsing [sent. 4878 len. 33]: After these he read a vulgar rime about an execution , pretending to be largely amused , making flat jokes of his own , and sometimes explaining elaborately where was no occasion .
Parsing [sent. 4879 len. 4]: `` Ian ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4880 len. 16]: said his mother at length ; `` have you bid farewell to your senses ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4881 len. 27]: `` No , mother , '' he answered ; `` what I am doing is the merest consequence of the way you brought us up . ''
Parsing [sent. 4882 len. 8]: `` I do n't understand that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4883 len. 3]: she returned .
Parsing [sent. 4884 len. 15]: `` You always taught us to do the best we could for our visitors .
Parsing [sent. 4885 len. 15]: So when I fail to interest them , I try to amuse them . ''
Parsing [sent. 4886 len. 12]: `` But you need not make a fool of yourself ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4887 len. 25]: `` It is better to make a fool of myself , than let Miss Palmer make a fool of -- a great man ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4888 len. 24]: `` Mr. Ian , '' said Christina , `` it is not of yourself but of me you have been making a fool .
Parsing [sent. 4889 len. 6]: -- I deserved it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4890 len. 8]: she added , and burst into tears .
Parsing [sent. 4891 len. 23]: `` Miss Palmer , '' said Ian , `` I will drop my foolishness , if you will drop your fun . ''
Parsing [sent. 4892 len. 8]: `` I will , '' answered Christina .
Parsing [sent. 4893 len. 19]: And Ian read them the poem beginning -- `` Three years she grew in sun and shower . ''
Parsing [sent. 4894 len. 28]: Scoffing at what is beautiful , is not necessarily a sign of evil ; it may only indicate stupidity or undevelopment : the beauty is not perceived .
Parsing [sent. 4895 len. 9]: But blame is often present in prolonged undevelopment .
Parsing [sent. 4896 len. 21]: Surely no one habitually obeying his conscience would long be left without a visit from some shape of the beautiful !
Parsing [sent. 4897 len. 3]: CHAPTER XII .
Parsing [sent. 4898 len. 2]: NATURE .
Parsing [sent. 4899 len. 11]: The girls had every liberty ; their mother seldom interfered .
Parsing [sent. 4900 len. 26]: Herself true to her own dim horn-lantern , she had confidence in the discretion of her daughters , and looked for no more than discretion .
Parsing [sent. 4901 len. 34]: Hence an amount of intercourse was possible between them and the young men , which must have speedily grown to a genuine intimacy had they inhabited even a neighbouring sphere of conscious life .
Parsing [sent. 4902 len. 17]: Almost unknown to herself , however , a change for the better had begun in Mercy .
Parsing [sent. 4903 len. 29]: She had not yet laid hold of , had not yet perceived any truth ; but she had some sense of the blank where truth ought to be .
Parsing [sent. 4904 len. 27]: It was not a sense that truth was lacking ; it was only a sense that something was not in her which was in those men .
Parsing [sent. 4905 len. 55]: A nature such as hers , one that had not yet sinned against the truth , was not one long to frequent such a warm atmosphere of live truth , without approach to the hour when it must chip its shell , open its eyes , and acknowledge a world of duty around it .
Parsing [sent. 4906 len. 62]: One lovely star-lit night of keen frost , the two mothers were sitting by a red peat-fire in the little drawing-room of the cottage , and Ian was talking to the girls over some sketches he had made in the north , when the chief came in , bringing with him an air of sharp exhilaration , and proposed a walk .
Parsing [sent. 4907 len. 10]: `` Come and have a taste of star-light ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4908 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 4909 len. 13]: The girls rose at once , and were ready in a minute .
Parsing [sent. 4910 len. 25]: The chief was walking between the two ladies , and Ian was a few steps in front , his head bent as in thought .
Parsing [sent. 4911 len. 24]: Suddenly , Mercy saw him spread out his arms toward the starry vault , with his face to its serrated edge of mountain-tops .
Parsing [sent. 4912 len. 18]: The feeling , almost the sense of another presence awoke in her , and as quickly vanished .
Parsing [sent. 4913 len. 8]: The thought , IS HE A PANTHEIST ?
Parsing [sent. 4914 len. 4]: took its place .
Parsing [sent. 4915 len. 11]: Had she not surprised him in an act of worship ?
Parsing [sent. 4916 len. 19]: In that wide outspreading of the lifted arms , was he not worshipping the whole , the Pan ?
Parsing [sent. 4917 len. 11]: Sky and stars and mountains and sea were his God !
Parsing [sent. 4918 len. 21]: She walked aghast , forgetful of a hundred things she had heard him say that might have settled the point .
Parsing [sent. 4919 len. 29]: She had , during the last day or two , been reading an article in which PANTHEISM was once and again referred to with more horror than definiteness .
Parsing [sent. 4920 len. 12]: Recovering herself a little , she ventured approach to the subject .
Parsing [sent. 4921 len. 36]: `` Macruadh , '' she said , `` Mr. Ian and you often say things about NATURE that I can not understand : I wish you would tell me what you mean by it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4922 len. 5]: `` By what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4923 len. 3]: asked Alister .
Parsing [sent. 4924 len. 7]: `` By NATURE '' answered Mercy .
Parsing [sent. 4925 len. 58]: `` I heard Mr. Ian say , for instance , the other night , that he did not like Nature to take liberties with him ; you said she might take what liberties with you she pleased ; and then you went on talking so that I could not understand a word either of you said ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4926 len. 33]: While she spoke , Ian had turned and rejoined them , and they were now walking in a line , Mercy between the two men , and Christina on Ian 's right .
Parsing [sent. 4927 len. 19]: The brothers looked at each other : it would be hard to make her understand just that example !
Parsing [sent. 4928 len. 8]: Something more rudimentary must prepare the way !
Parsing [sent. 4929 len. 27]: Silence fell for a moment , and then Ian said -- `` We mean by nature every visitation of the outside world through our senses . ''
Parsing [sent. 4930 len. 8]: `` More plainly , please Mr. Ian !
Parsing [sent. 4931 len. 25]: You can not imagine how stupid I feel when you are talking your thinks , as once I heard a child call them . ''
Parsing [sent. 4932 len. 28]: `` I mean by nature , then , all that you see and hear and smell and taste and feel of the things round about you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4933 len. 18]: `` If that be all you mean , why should you make it seem so difficult ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4934 len. 7]: `` But that is not all .
Parsing [sent. 4935 len. 16]: We mean the things themselves only for the sake of what they say to us .
Parsing [sent. 4936 len. 46]: As our sense of smell brings us news of fields far off , so those fields , or even the smell only that comes from them , tell us of things , meanings , thoughts , intentions beyond them , and embodied in them . ''
Parsing [sent. 4937 len. 14]: `` And that is why you speak of Nature as a person ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4938 len. 3]: asked Mercy .
Parsing [sent. 4939 len. 9]: `` Whatever influences us must be a person .
Parsing [sent. 4940 len. 66]: But God is the only real person , being in himself , and without help from anybody ; and so we talk even of the world which is but his living garment , as if that were a person ; and we call it SHE as if it were a woman , because so many of God 's loveliest influences come to us through her .
Parsing [sent. 4941 len. 11]: She always seems to me a beautiful old grandmother . ''
Parsing [sent. 4942 len. 5]: `` But there now !
Parsing [sent. 4943 len. 21]: when you talk of her influences , and the liberties she takes , I do not know what you mean .
Parsing [sent. 4944 len. 20]: She seems to do and he something to you which certainly she does not and is not to me .
Parsing [sent. 4945 len. 10]: I can not tell what to make of it .
Parsing [sent. 4946 len. 42]: I feel just as when our music-master was talking away about thorough bass : I could not get hold , head or tail , of what the man was after , and we all agreed there was no sense in it .
Parsing [sent. 4947 len. 13]: Now I begin to suspect there must have been too much ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4948 len. 9]: `` There is no fear of her ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4949 len. 5]: said Ian to himself .
Parsing [sent. 4950 len. 11]: `` My heart told me the truth about her ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4951 len. 4]: thought Alister jubilant .
Parsing [sent. 4952 len. 8]: `` Now we shall have talk ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4953 len. 18]: `` I think I can let you see into it , Miss Mercy , '' said Ian .
Parsing [sent. 4954 len. 57]: `` Imagine for a moment how it would be if , instead of having a roof like ` this most excellent canopy the air , this brave o'erhanging , this majestical roof , fretted with golden fire , ' -- '' `` Are you making the words , or saying them out of a book ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4955 len. 3]: interrupted Mercy .
Parsing [sent. 4956 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 4957 len. 6]: you do n't know Hamlet ?
Parsing [sent. 4958 len. 19]: How rich I should feel myself if I had the first reading of it before me like you !
Parsing [sent. 4959 len. 43]: -- But imagine how different it would have been if , instead of such a roof , we had only clouds , hanging always down , like the flies in a theatre , within a yard or two of our heads ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4960 len. 18]: Mercy was silent for a moment , then said , `` It would be horribly wearisome . ''
Parsing [sent. 4961 len. 7]: `` It would indeed be wearisome !
Parsing [sent. 4962 len. 15]: But how do you think it would affect your nature , your being ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4963 len. 12]: Mercy held the peace which is the ignorant man 's wisdom .
Parsing [sent. 4964 len. 13]: `` We should have known nothing of astronomy , '' said Christina .
Parsing [sent. 4965 len. 26]: `` True ; and the worst would have been , that the soul would have had no astronomy -- no notion of heavenly things . ''
Parsing [sent. 4966 len. 9]: `` There you leave me out again ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4967 len. 3]: said Mercy .
Parsing [sent. 4968 len. 32]: `` I mean , '' said Ian , `` that it would have had no sense of outstretching , endless space , no feeling of heights above , and depths beneath .
Parsing [sent. 4969 len. 13]: The idea of space would not have come awake in it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4970 len. 5]: `` I understand ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4971 len. 3]: said Christina .
Parsing [sent. 4972 len. 16]: `` But I do not see that we should have been much the worse off .
Parsing [sent. 4973 len. 12]: Why should we have the idea of more than we want ?
Parsing [sent. 4974 len. 18]: So long as we have room , I do not see what space matters to us ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4975 len. 17]: `` Ah , but when the soul wakes up , it needs all space for room !
Parsing [sent. 4976 len. 11]: A limit of thousands of worlds will not content it .
Parsing [sent. 4977 len. 12]: Mere elbow-room will not do when the soul wakes up ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4978 len. 11]: `` Then my soul is not waked up yet ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4979 len. 6]: rejoined Christina with a laugh .
Parsing [sent. 4980 len. 21]: Ian did not reply , and Christina felt that he accepted the proposition , absurd as it seemed to herself .
Parsing [sent. 4981 len. 13]: `` But there is far more than that , '' he resumed .
Parsing [sent. 4982 len. 20]: `` What notion could you have had of majesty , if the heavens seemed scarce higher than the earth ?
Parsing [sent. 4983 len. 17]: what feeling of the grandeur of him we call God , of his illimitation in goodness ?
Parsing [sent. 4984 len. 11]: For space is the body to the idea of liberty .
Parsing [sent. 4985 len. 32]: Liberty is -- God and the souls that love ; these are the limitless room , the space , in which thoughts , the souls of things , have their being .
Parsing [sent. 4986 len. 35]: If there were no holy mind , then no freedom , no spiritual space , therefore no thoughts ; just as , if there were no space , there could be no things . ''
Parsing [sent. 4987 len. 15]: Ian saw that not even Alister was following him , and changed his key .
Parsing [sent. 4988 len. 16]: `` Look up , '' he said , `` and tell me what you see .
Parsing [sent. 4989 len. 9]: -- What is the shape over us ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4990 len. 10]: `` It is a vault , '' replied Christina .
Parsing [sent. 4991 len. 9]: `` A dome -- is it not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4992 len. 3]: said Mercy .
Parsing [sent. 4993 len. 19]: `` Yes ; a vault or a dome , recognizable at the moment mainly by its shining points .
Parsing [sent. 4994 len. 23]: This dome we understand to be the complement or completing part of a correspondent dome on the other side of the world .
Parsing [sent. 4995 len. 20]: It follows that we are in the heart of a hollow sphere of loveliest blue , spangled with light .
Parsing [sent. 4996 len. 10]: Now the sphere is the one perfect geometrical form .
Parsing [sent. 4997 len. 12]: Over and round us then we have the one perfect shape .
Parsing [sent. 4998 len. 37]: I do not say it is put there for the purpose of representing God ; I say it is there of necessity , because of its nature , and its nature is its relation to God .
Parsing [sent. 4999 len. 36]: It is of God 's thinking ; and that half-sphere above men 's heads , with influence endlessly beyond the reach of their consciousness , is the beginning of all revelation of him to men .
Parsing [sent. 5000 len. 6]: They must begin with that .
Parsing [sent. 5001 len. 35]: It is the simplest as well as most external likeness of him , while its relation to him goes so deep that it represents things in his very nature that nothing else could . ''
Parsing [sent. 5002 len. 9]: `` You bewilder me , '' said Mercy .
Parsing [sent. 5003 len. 7]: `` I can not follow you .
Parsing [sent. 5004 len. 10]: I am not fit for such high things ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5005 len. 32]: `` I will go on ; you will soon begin to see what I mean : I know what you are fit for better than you do yourself , Miss Mercy .
Parsing [sent. 5006 len. 16]: -- Think then how it would be if this blue sky were plainly a solid .
Parsing [sent. 5007 len. 28]: Men of old believed it a succession of hollow spheres , one outside the other ; it is hardly a wonder they should have had little gods .
Parsing [sent. 5008 len. 30]: No matter how high the vault of the inclosing sphere ; limited at all it could not declare the glory of God , it could only show his handiwork .
Parsing [sent. 5009 len. 59]: In our day it is a sphere only to the eyes ; it is a foreshortening of infinitude that it may enter our sight ; there is no imagining of a limit to it ; it is a sphere only in this , that in no one direction can we come nearer to its circumference than in another .
Parsing [sent. 5010 len. 52]: This infinitive sphere , I say then , or , if you like it better , this spheric infinitude , is the only figure , image , emblem , symbol , fit to begin us to know God ; it is an idea incomprehensible ; we can only believe in it .
Parsing [sent. 5011 len. 72]: In like manner God can not by searching be found out , can not be grasped by any mind , yet is ever before us , the one we can best know , the one we must know , the one we can not help knowing ; for his end in giving us being is that his humblest creature should at length possess himself , and be possessed by him . ''
Parsing [sent. 5012 len. 15]: `` I think I begin , '' said Mercy -- and said no more .
Parsing [sent. 5013 len. 26]: `` If it were not for the outside world , '' resumed Ian , `` we should have no inside world to understand things by .
Parsing [sent. 5014 len. 24]: Least of all could we understand God without these millions of sights and sounds and scents and motions , weaving their endless harmonies .
Parsing [sent. 5015 len. 19]: They come out from his heart to let us know a little of what is in it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5016 len. 6]: Alister had been listening hard .
Parsing [sent. 5017 len. 36]: He could not originate such things , but he could understand them ; and his delight in them proved them his own , although his brother had sunk the shaft that laid open their lode .
Parsing [sent. 5018 len. 13]: `` I never heard you put a thing better , Ian ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5019 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 5020 len. 27]: `` You gentlemen , '' said Mercy , `` seem to have a place to think in that I do n't know how to get into !
Parsing [sent. 5021 len. 14]: Could you not open your church-door a little wider to let me in ?
Parsing [sent. 5022 len. 10]: There must be room for more than two ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5023 len. 23]: She was looking up at Alister , not so much afraid of him ; Ian was to her hardly of this world .
Parsing [sent. 5024 len. 29]: In her eyes Alister saw something that seemed to reflect the starlight ; but it might have been a luminous haze about the waking stars of her soul !
Parsing [sent. 5025 len. 25]: `` My brother has always been janitor to me , '' replied Alister ; `` I do not know how to open any door .
Parsing [sent. 5026 len. 29]: But here no door needs to be opened ; you have just to step straight into the temple of nature , among all the good people worshipping . ''
Parsing [sent. 5027 len. 3]: `` There !
Parsing [sent. 5028 len. 9]: that is what I was afraid of ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5029 len. 9]: cried Mercy : `` you are pantheists ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5030 len. 8]: `` Bless my soul , Mercy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5031 len. 10]: exclaimed Christina ; `` what do you mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5032 len. 7]: `` Yes , '' answered Ian .
Parsing [sent. 5033 len. 31]: `` If to believe that not a lily can grow , not a sparrow fall to the ground without our Father , be pantheism , Alister and I are pantheists .
Parsing [sent. 5034 len. 19]: If by pantheism you mean anything that would not fit with that , we are not pantheists . ''
Parsing [sent. 5035 len. 15]: `` Why should we trouble about religion more than is required of us ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5036 len. 3]: interposed Christina .
Parsing [sent. 5037 len. 5]: `` Why indeed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5038 len. 3]: returned Ian .
Parsing [sent. 5039 len. 9]: `` But then how much is required ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5040 len. 18]: `` You require far more than my father , and he is good enough for me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5041 len. 21]: `` The Master says we are to love God with all our hearts and souls and strength and mind . ''
Parsing [sent. 5042 len. 14]: `` That was in the old law , Ian , '' said Alister .
Parsing [sent. 5043 len. 5]: `` You are right .
Parsing [sent. 5044 len. 10]: Jesus only justified it -- and did it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5045 len. 13]: `` How then can you worship in the temple of Nature ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5046 len. 3]: said Mercy .
Parsing [sent. 5047 len. 6]: `` Just as he did .
Parsing [sent. 5048 len. 19]: It is Nature 's temple , mind , for the worship of God , not of herself ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5049 len. 10]: `` But how am I to get into it ?
Parsing [sent. 5050 len. 9]: That is what I want to know . ''
Parsing [sent. 5051 len. 33]: `` The innermost places of the temple are open only to such as already worship in a greater temple ; but it has courts into which any honest soul may enter . ''
Parsing [sent. 5052 len. 11]: `` You would n't set me to study Wordsworth ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5053 len. 6]: `` By no means . ''
Parsing [sent. 5054 len. 29]: `` I am glad of that -- though there must be more in him than I see , or you could n't care for him so much ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5055 len. 16]: `` Some of Nature 's lessons you must learn before you can understand them . ''
Parsing [sent. 5056 len. 16]: `` Can you call it learning a lesson if you do not understand it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5057 len. 8]: `` Yes -- to a certain extent .
Parsing [sent. 5058 len. 13]: Did you learn at school to work the rule of three ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5059 len. 12]: `` Yes ; and I was rather fond of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5060 len. 7]: `` Did you understand it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5061 len. 9]: `` I could work sums in it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5062 len. 27]: `` Did you see how it was that setting the terms down so , and working out the rule , must give you a true answer .
Parsing [sent. 5063 len. 30]: Did you perceive that it was safe to buy or sell , to build a house , or lay out a garden , by the rule of three ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5064 len. 5]: `` I did not .
Parsing [sent. 5065 len. 6]: I do not yet . ''
Parsing [sent. 5066 len. 13]: `` Then one may so far learn a lesson without understanding it !
Parsing [sent. 5067 len. 13]: All do , more or less , in Dame Nature 's school .
Parsing [sent. 5068 len. 15]: Not a few lessons must be so learned in order to be better learned .
Parsing [sent. 5069 len. 27]: Without being so learned first , it is not possible to understand them ; the scholar has not facts enough about the things to understand them .
Parsing [sent. 5070 len. 26]: Keats 's youthful delight in Nature was more intense even than Wordsworth 's , but he was only beginning to understand her when he died .
Parsing [sent. 5071 len. 19]: Shelley was much nearer understanding her than Keats , but he was drowned before he did understand her .
Parsing [sent. 5072 len. 8]: Wordsworth was far before either of them .
Parsing [sent. 5073 len. 30]: At the same time , presumptuous as it may appear , I believe there are regions to be traversed , beyond any point to which Wordsworth leads us . ''
Parsing [sent. 5074 len. 8]: `` But how am I to begin ?
Parsing [sent. 5075 len. 4]: Do tell me .
Parsing [sent. 5076 len. 10]: Nothing you say helps me in the least . ''
Parsing [sent. 5077 len. 20]: `` I have all the time been leading you toward the door at which you want to go in .
Parsing [sent. 5078 len. 16]: It is not likely , however , that it will open to you at once .
Parsing [sent. 5079 len. 15]: I doubt if it will open to you at all except through sorrow . ''
Parsing [sent. 5080 len. 9]: `` You are a most encouraging master ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5081 len. 8]: said Christina , with a light laugh .
Parsing [sent. 5082 len. 27]: `` It was Wordsworth 's bitter disappointment in the outcome of the French revolution , '' continued Ian , `` that opened the door to him .
Parsing [sent. 5083 len. 21]: Yet he had gone through the outer courts of the temple with more understanding than any who immediately preceded him .
Parsing [sent. 5084 len. 11]: -- Will you let me ask you a question ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5085 len. 6]: `` You frighten me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5086 len. 3]: said Mercy .
Parsing [sent. 5087 len. 7]: `` I am sorry for that .
Parsing [sent. 5088 len. 8]: We will talk of something else . ''
Parsing [sent. 5089 len. 21]: `` I am not afraid of what you may ask me ; I am frightened at what you tell me .
Parsing [sent. 5090 len. 15]: I fear to go on if I must meet Sorrow on the way ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5091 len. 12]: `` You make one think of some terrible secret society ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5092 len. 3]: said Christina .
Parsing [sent. 5093 len. 16]: `` Tell me then , Miss Mercy , is there anything you love very much ?
Parsing [sent. 5094 len. 12]: I do n't say any PERSON , but any THING . ''
Parsing [sent. 5095 len. 7]: `` I love some animals . ''
Parsing [sent. 5096 len. 8]: `` An animal is not a thing .
Parsing [sent. 5097 len. 16]: It is possible to love animals and not the nature of which we are speaking .
Parsing [sent. 5098 len. 16]: You might love a dog dearly , and never care to see the sun rise !
Parsing [sent. 5099 len. 12]: -- Tell me , did any flower ever make you cry ?
Parsing [sent. 5100 len. 18]: `` No , '' answered Mercy , with a puzzled laugh ; `` how could it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5101 len. 26]: `` Did any flower ever make you a moment later in going to bed , or a moment earlier in getting out of it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5102 len. 6]: `` No , certainly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5103 len. 12]: `` In that direction , then , I am foiled ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5104 len. 15]: `` You would not really have me cry over a flower , Mr. Ian ?
Parsing [sent. 5105 len. 9]: Did ever a flower make you cry yourself ?
Parsing [sent. 5106 len. 4]: Of course not !
Parsing [sent. 5107 len. 11]: it is only silly women that cry for nothing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5108 len. 16]: `` I would rather not bring myself in at present , '' answered Ian smiling .
Parsing [sent. 5109 len. 11]: `` Do you know how Chaucer felt about flowers ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5110 len. 10]: `` I never read a word of Chaucer . ''
Parsing [sent. 5111 len. 9]: `` Shall I give you an instance ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5112 len. 4]: `` Please . ''
Parsing [sent. 5113 len. 25]: `` Chaucer was a man of the world , a courtier , more or less a man of affairs , employed by Edward III .
Parsing [sent. 5114 len. 18]: in foreign business of state : you can not mistake him for an effeminate or sentimental man !
Parsing [sent. 5115 len. 47]: He does not anywhere , so far as I remember , say that ever he cried over a flower , but he shows a delight in some flowers so delicate and deep that it must have a source profounder than that of most people 's tears .
Parsing [sent. 5116 len. 26]: When we go back I will read you what he says about the daisy ; but one more general passage I think I could repeat .
Parsing [sent. 5117 len. 8]: There are animals in it too ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5118 len. 11]: `` Pray let us hear it , '' said Christina .
Parsing [sent. 5119 len. 86]: He spoke the following stanzas -- not quite correctly , but supplying for the moment 's need where he could not recall : -- A gardein saw I , full of blosomed bowis , Upon a river , in a grene mede , There as sweetnesse evermore inough is , With floures white , blewe , yelowe , and rede , And cold welle streames , nothing dede , That swommen full of smale fishes light , With finnes rede , and scales silver bright .
Parsing [sent. 5120 len. 69]: On every bough the birdes heard I sing , With voice of angell , in hir armonie , That busied hem , hir birdes forth to bring , The little pretty conies to hir play gan hie , And further all about I gan espie , The dredeful roe , the buck , the hart , and hind , Squirrels , and beastes small , of gentle kind .
Parsing [sent. 5121 len. 63]: Of instruments of stringes in accorde , Heard I so play , a ravishing swetnesse , That God , that maker is of all and Lorde , Ne heard never better , as I gesse , Therewith a wind , unneth it might be lesse , Made in the leaves grene a noise soft , Accordant to the foules song on loft .
Parsing [sent. 5122 len. 67]: The aire of the place so attempre was , That never was ther grevance of hot ne cold , There was eke every noisome spice and gras , Ne no man may there waxe sicke ne old , Yet was there more joy o thousand fold , Than I can tell or ever could or might , There is ever clere day , and never night .
Parsing [sent. 5123 len. 34]: He modernized them also a little in repeating them , so that his hearers missed nothing through failing to understand the words : how much they gained , it were hard to say .
Parsing [sent. 5124 len. 24]: `` It reminds one , '' commented Ian , `` of Dante 's paradise on the top of the hill of purgatory . ''
Parsing [sent. 5125 len. 15]: `` I do n't know anything about Dante either , '' said Mercy regretfully .
Parsing [sent. 5126 len. 8]: `` There is plenty of time ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5127 len. 3]: said Ian .
Parsing [sent. 5128 len. 10]: `` But there is so much to learn ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5129 len. 7]: returned Mercy in a hopeless tone .
Parsing [sent. 5130 len. 9]: `` That is the joy of existence ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5131 len. 3]: Ian replied .
Parsing [sent. 5132 len. 15]: `` We are not bound to know ; we are only bound to learn .
Parsing [sent. 5133 len. 16]: -- But to return to my task : a man may really love a flower .
Parsing [sent. 5134 len. 61]: In another poem Chaucer tells us that such is his delight in his books that no other pleasure can take him from them -- Save certainly , when that the month of May Is comen , and that I heare the foules sing , And that the floures ginnen for to spring , Farwell my booke , and my devotion !
Parsing [sent. 5135 len. 11]: Poor people love flowers ; rich people admire them . ''
Parsing [sent. 5136 len. 20]: `` But , '' said Mercy , `` how can one love a thing that has no life ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5137 len. 49]: Ian could have told her that whatever grows must live ; he could further have told her his belief that life can not be without its measure of consciousness ; but it would have led to more difficulty , and away from the end he had in view .
Parsing [sent. 5138 len. 24]: He felt also that no imaginable degree of consciousness in it was commensurate with the love he had himself for almost any flower .
Parsing [sent. 5139 len. 32]: His answer to Mercy 's question was this : -- `` The flowers come from the same heart as man himself , and are sent to be his companions and ministers .
Parsing [sent. 5140 len. 12]: There is something divinely magical , because profoundly human in them .
Parsing [sent. 5141 len. 24]: In some at least the human is plain ; we see a face of childlike peace and confidence that appeals to our best .
Parsing [sent. 5142 len. 24]: Our feeling for many of them doubtless owes something to childish associations ; but how did they get their hold of our childhood ?
Parsing [sent. 5143 len. 9]: Why did they enter our souls at all ?
Parsing [sent. 5144 len. 17]: They are joyous , inarticulate children , come with vague messages from the father of all .
Parsing [sent. 5145 len. 26]: If I confess that what they say to me sometimes makes me weep , how can I call my feeling for them anything but love ?
Parsing [sent. 5146 len. 16]: The eternal thing may have a thousand forms of which we know nothing yet ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5147 len. 31]: Mercy felt Ian must mean something she ought to like , if only she knew what it was ; but he had not yet told her anything to help her !
Parsing [sent. 5148 len. 24]: He had , however , neither reached his end nor lost his way ; he was leading her on -- gently and naturally .
Parsing [sent. 5149 len. 21]: `` I did not mean , '' he resumed , `` that you must of necessity begin with the flowers .
Parsing [sent. 5150 len. 14]: I was only inquiring whether at that point you were nearer to Nature .
Parsing [sent. 5151 len. 10]: -- Tell me -- were you ever alone ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5152 len. 4]: `` Alone ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5153 len. 6]: repeated Mercy , thinking . ''
Parsing [sent. 5154 len. 10]: -- Surely everybody has been many times alone ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5155 len. 11]: `` Could you tell when last you were alone ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5156 len. 8]: She thought , but could not tell .
Parsing [sent. 5157 len. 21]: `` What I want to ask you , '' said Ian , `` is -- did you ever feel alone ?
Parsing [sent. 5158 len. 9]: Did you ever for a moment inhabit loneliness ?
Parsing [sent. 5159 len. 21]: Did it ever press itself upon you that there was nobody near -- that if you called nobody would hear ?
Parsing [sent. 5160 len. 22]: You are not alone while you know that you can have a fellow creature with you the instant you choose . ''
Parsing [sent. 5161 len. 13]: `` I hardly think I was ever alone in that way . ''
Parsing [sent. 5162 len. 38]: `` Then what I would have you do , '' continued Ian , `` is -- to make yourself alone in one of Nature 's withdrawing-rooms , and seat yourself in one of Grannie 's own chairs .
Parsing [sent. 5163 len. 10]: -- I am coming to the point at last !
Parsing [sent. 5164 len. 15]: -- Upon a day when the weather is fine , go out by yourself .
Parsing [sent. 5165 len. 15]: Tell no one where you are going , or that you are going anywhere .
Parsing [sent. 5166 len. 4]: Climb a hill .
Parsing [sent. 5167 len. 19]: If you can not get to the top of it , go high on the side of it .
Parsing [sent. 5168 len. 5]: No book , mind !
Parsing [sent. 5169 len. 9]: nothing to fill your thinking-place from auother 's !
Parsing [sent. 5170 len. 35]: People are always saying ' I think , ' when they are not thinking at all , when they are at best only passing the thoughts of others whom they do not even know .
Parsing [sent. 5171 len. 26]: `` When you have got quite alone , when you do not even know the nearest point to anybody , sit down and be lonely .
Parsing [sent. 5172 len. 40]: Look out on the loneliness , the wide world round you , and the great vault over you , with the lonely sun in the middle of it ; fold your hands in your lap , and be still .
Parsing [sent. 5173 len. 7]: Do not try to think anything .
Parsing [sent. 5174 len. 17]: Do not try to call up any feeling or sentiment or sensation ; just be still .
Parsing [sent. 5175 len. 17]: By and by , it may be , you will begin to know something of Nature .
Parsing [sent. 5176 len. 64]: I do not know you well enough to be sure about it ; but if you tell me afterwards how you fared , I shall then know you a little better , and perhaps be able to tell you whether Nature will soon speak to you , or not until , as Henry Vaughan says , some veil be broken in you . ''
Parsing [sent. 5177 len. 12]: They were approaching the cottage , and little more was said .
Parsing [sent. 5178 len. 22]: They found Mrs. Palmer prepared to go , and Mercy was not sorry : she had had enough for a while .
Parsing [sent. 5179 len. 21]: She was troubled at the thought that perhaps she was helplessly shut out from the life inhabited by the brothers .
Parsing [sent. 5180 len. 13]: When she lay down , her own life seemed dull and poor .
Parsing [sent. 5181 len. 34]: These men , with all their kindness , respect , attention , and even attendance upon them , did not show them the homage which the men of their own circle paid them !
Parsing [sent. 5182 len. 8]: `` They will never miss us ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5183 len. 5]: she said to herself .
Parsing [sent. 5184 len. 19]: `` They will go on with their pantheism , or whatever it is , all the same ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5185 len. 17]: But they should not say she was one of those who talk but will not do !
Parsing [sent. 5186 len. 7]: That scorn she could not bear !
Parsing [sent. 5187 len. 31]: All the time , however , the thing seemed to savour more of spell or cast of magic than philosophy : the means enjoined were suggestive of a silent incantation !
Parsing [sent. 5188 len. 3]: CHAPTER XIII .
Parsing [sent. 5189 len. 3]: GRANNY ANGRY .
Parsing [sent. 5190 len. 20]: It must not be supposed that all the visiting was on the part of those of the New House .
Parsing [sent. 5191 len. 11]: The visits thence were returned by both matron and men .
Parsing [sent. 5192 len. 16]: But somehow there was never the same freedom in the house as in the cottage .
Parsing [sent. 5193 len. 25]: The difference did not lie in the presence of the younger girls : they were well behaved , friendly , and nowise disagreeable children .
Parsing [sent. 5194 len. 29]: Doubtless there was something in the absence of books : it was of no use to jump up when a passage occurred ; help was not at hand .
Parsing [sent. 5195 len. 25]: But it was more the air of the place , the presence of so many common-place things , that clogged the wheels of thought .
Parsing [sent. 5196 len. 33]: Neither , with all her knowledge of the world and all her sweetness , did Mrs. Palmer understand the essentials of hospitality half so well as the widow of the late minister-chief .
Parsing [sent. 5197 len. 14]: All of them liked , and confessed that they liked the cottage best .
Parsing [sent. 5198 len. 9]: Even Christina felt something lacking in their reception .
Parsing [sent. 5199 len. 17]: She regretted that the house was not grand enough to show what they were accustomed to .
Parsing [sent. 5200 len. 43]: Mrs. Palmer seldom understood the talk , and although she sat looking persistently content , was always haunted with a dim feeling that her hushand would not be hest pleased at so much intercourse between his rich daughters and those penniless country-fellows .
Parsing [sent. 5201 len. 6]: But what could she do !
Parsing [sent. 5202 len. 14]: the place where he had abandoned them was so dull , so solitary !
Parsing [sent. 5203 len. 6]: the girls must not mope !
Parsing [sent. 5204 len. 20]: Christina would wither up without amusement , and then good-bye to her beauty and all that depended upon it !
Parsing [sent. 5205 len. 32]: In the purity of her motherhood , she more than liked the young men : happy mother she would think herself , were her daughters to marry such men as these !
Parsing [sent. 5206 len. 14]: The relations between them and their mother delighted her : they were one !
Parsing [sent. 5207 len. 5]: their hearts were together !
Parsing [sent. 5208 len. 5]: they understood each other !
Parsing [sent. 5209 len. 10]: She could never have such bliss with her sons !
Parsing [sent. 5210 len. 30]: Never since she gave them birth had she had one such look from either of hers as she saw pass every now and then from these to their mother !
Parsing [sent. 5211 len. 15]: It would be like being born again to feel herself loved in that way !
Parsing [sent. 5212 len. 23]: For any danger to the girls , she thought with a sigh how soon in London they would forget the young highlanders .
Parsing [sent. 5213 len. 10]: Was there no possibility of securing one of them ?
Parsing [sent. 5214 len. 10]: What chance was there of Mercy 's marrying well !
Parsing [sent. 5215 len. 6]: she was so decidedly plain !
Parsing [sent. 5216 len. 24]: Was the idea of marrying her into an old and once powerful family like that of the Macruadh , to her husband inconceivable ?
Parsing [sent. 5217 len. 14]: Could he not restore its property as the dowry of his unprized daughter !
Parsing [sent. 5218 len. 9]: it would be to him but a trifle !
Parsing [sent. 5219 len. 17]: -- and he could stipulate that the chief should acknowledge the baronetcy and use his title !
Parsing [sent. 5220 len. 31]: Mercy would then be a woman of consequence , and Peregrine would have the Bible-honour of being the repairer of the breach , the restorer of paths to dwell in !
Parsing [sent. 5221 len. 54]: -- Such were some of the thoughts that would come and go in the brain of the mother as she sat ; nor were they without a share in her readiness to allow her daughters to go out with the young men : she had an unquestioning conviction of their safety with them .
Parsing [sent. 5222 len. 22]: The days went by , and what to Christina had seemed imprisonment , began to look like some sort of liberty .
Parsing [sent. 5223 len. 23]: She had scarce come nearer to sympathy with those whose society consoled her , but their talk had ceased to sound repulsive .
Parsing [sent. 5224 len. 16]: She was infinitely more than a well-modelled waxflower , and yet hardly a growing plant .
Parsing [sent. 5225 len. 10]: More was needed to wake her than friends awake .
Parsing [sent. 5226 len. 21]: It is wonderful how long the sleeping may go with the waking , and not discover any difference between them .
Parsing [sent. 5227 len. 8]: But Grannie Nature was about to interfere .
Parsing [sent. 5228 len. 6]: The spring drew gently on .
Parsing [sent. 5229 len. 12]: It would be long ere summer was summer enough to show .
Parsing [sent. 5230 len. 33]: There seemed more of the destructive in the spring itself than of the genial -- cold winds , great showers , days of steady rain , sudden assaults of hail and sleet .
Parsing [sent. 5231 len. 52]: Still it was spring , and at length , one fine day with a bright sun , snow on the hills , and clouds in the east , but no sign of any sudden change , the girls went out for a walk , and took the younger girls with them .
Parsing [sent. 5232 len. 32]: A little way up the valley , out of sight of the cottage , a small burn came down its own dell to join that which flowed through the chiefs farm .
Parsing [sent. 5233 len. 17]: Its channel was wide , but except in time of rain had little water in it .
Parsing [sent. 5234 len. 28]: About half a mile up its course it divided , or rather the channel did , for in one of its branches there was seldom any water .
Parsing [sent. 5235 len. 32]: At the fork was a low rocky mound , with an ancient ruin of no great size-three or four fragments of thick walls , within whose plan grew a slender birch-tree .
Parsing [sent. 5236 len. 54]: Thither went the little party , wandering up the stream : the valley was sheltered ; no wind but the south could reach it ; and the sun , though it could not make it very warm , as it looked only aslant on its slopes , yet lighted both sides of it .
Parsing [sent. 5237 len. 30]: Great white clouds passed slowly across the sky , with now and then a nearer black one threatening rain , but a wind overhead was carrying them quickly athwart .
Parsing [sent. 5238 len. 34]: Ian had seen the ladies pass , but made no effort to overtake them , although he was bound in the same direction : he preferred sauntering along with a book of ballads .
Parsing [sent. 5239 len. 32]: Suddenly his attention was roused by a peculiar whistle , which he knew for that of Hector of the Stags : it was one of the few sounds he could make .
Parsing [sent. 5240 len. 41]: Three times it was hurriedly repeated , and ere the third was over , Ian had discovered Hector high on a hill on the opposite side of the burn , waving his arms , and making eager signs to him .
Parsing [sent. 5241 len. 8]: He stopped and set himself to understand .
Parsing [sent. 5242 len. 32]: Hector was pointing with energy , but it was impossible to determine the exact direction : all that Ian could gather was , that his presence was wanted somewhere farther on .
Parsing [sent. 5243 len. 15]: He resumed his walk therefore at a rapid pace , whereupon Hector pointed higher .
Parsing [sent. 5244 len. 51]: There on the eastern horizon , towards the north , almost down upon the hills , Ian saw a congeries of clouds in strangest commotion , such as he had never before seen in any home latitude -- a mass of darkly variegated vapours manifesting a peculiar and appalling unrest .
Parsing [sent. 5245 len. 16]: It seemed tormented by a gyrating storm , twisting and contorting it with unceasing change .
Parsing [sent. 5246 len. 34]: Now the gray came writhing out , now the black came bulging through , now a dirty brown smeared the ashy white , and now the blue shone calmly out from eternal distances .
Parsing [sent. 5247 len. 19]: At the season he could hardly think it a thunderstorm , and stood absorbed in the unusual phenomenon .
Parsing [sent. 5248 len. 24]: But again , louder and more hurried , came the whistling , and again he saw Hector gesticulating , more wildly than before .
Parsing [sent. 5249 len. 49]: Then he knew that someone must be in want of help or succour , and set off running as hard as he could : he saw Hector keeping him in sight , and watching to give him further direction : perhaps the ladies had got into some difficulty !
Parsing [sent. 5250 len. 49]: When he arrived at the opening of the valley just mentioned , Hector 's gesticulations made it quite plain it was up there he must go ; and as soon as he entered it , he saw that the cloudy turmoil was among the hills at its head .
Parsing [sent. 5251 len. 25]: With that he began to suspect the danger the hunter feared , and almost the same instant heard the merry voices of the children .
Parsing [sent. 5252 len. 25]: Running yet faster , he came in sight of them on the other side of the stream , -- not a moment too soon .
Parsing [sent. 5253 len. 10]: The valley was full of a dull roaring sound .
Parsing [sent. 5254 len. 23]: He called to them as he ran , and the children saw and came running down toward him , followed by Mercy .
Parsing [sent. 5255 len. 18]: She was not looking much concerned , for she thought it only the grumbling of distant thunder .
Parsing [sent. 5256 len. 25]: But Ian saw , far up the valley , what looked like a low brown wall across it , and knew what it was .
Parsing [sent. 5257 len. 4]: `` Mercy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5258 len. 26]: he cried , `` run up the side of the hill directly ; you will be drowned -- swept away if you do not . ''
Parsing [sent. 5259 len. 23]: She looked incredulous , and glanced up the hill-side , but carne on as if to cross the burn and join him .
Parsing [sent. 5260 len. 31]: `` Do as I tell you , '' he cried , in a tone which few would have ventured to disregard , and turning darted across the channel toward her .
Parsing [sent. 5261 len. 31]: Mercy did not wait his coming , but took the children , each by a hand , and went a little way up the hill that immediately bordered the stream .
Parsing [sent. 5262 len. 3]: `` Farther !
Parsing [sent. 5263 len. 3]: farther ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5264 len. 6]: cried Ian as he ran .
Parsing [sent. 5265 len. 6]: `` Where is Christina ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5266 len. 9]: `` At the ruin , '' she answered .
Parsing [sent. 5267 len. 5]: `` Good heavens ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5268 len. 16]: exclaimed Ian , and darted off , crying , `` Up the hill with you !
Parsing [sent. 5269 len. 5]: up the hill ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5270 len. 15]: Christina was standing by the birch-tree in the ruin , looking down the burn .
Parsing [sent. 5271 len. 16]: She had heard Ian calling , and saw him running , but suspected no danger .
Parsing [sent. 5272 len. 14]: `` Come ; come directly ; for God 's sake , come ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5273 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 5274 len. 7]: `` Look up the burn ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5275 len. 8]: he added , seeing her hesitate bewildered .
Parsing [sent. 5276 len. 19]: She turned , looked , and came running to him , down the channel , white with terror .
Parsing [sent. 5277 len. 5]: It was too late .
Parsing [sent. 5278 len. 21]: The charging water , whose front rank was turf , and hushes , and stones , was almost upon her .
Parsing [sent. 5279 len. 35]: The solid matter had retarded its rush , but it was now on the point of dividing against the rocky mound , to sweep along both sides , and turn it into an island .
Parsing [sent. 5280 len. 39]: Ian bounded to her in the middle of the channel , caught her by the arm , and hurried her back to the mound as fast as they could run : it was the highest ground immediately accessible .
Parsing [sent. 5281 len. 37]: As they reached it , the water broke with a roar against its rocky base , rose , swelled -- and in a moment the island was covered with a brown , seething , swirling flood .
Parsing [sent. 5282 len. 9]: `` Where 's Mercy and the children ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5283 len. 10]: gasped Christina , as the water rose upon her .
Parsing [sent. 5284 len. 6]: `` Safe , safe ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5285 len. 3]: answered Ian .
Parsing [sent. 5286 len. 9]: `` We must get to the ruin ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5287 len. 12]: The water was halfway up his leg , and rising fast .
Parsing [sent. 5288 len. 6]: Their danger was but beginning .
Parsing [sent. 5289 len. 16]: Would the old walls , in greater part built without mortar , stand the rush ?
Parsing [sent. 5290 len. 11]: If a tree should strike them , they hardly would !
Parsing [sent. 5291 len. 26]: If the flood came from a waterspout , it would soon be over -- only how high it might first rise , who could tell !
Parsing [sent. 5292 len. 25]: Such were his thoughts as they struggled to the ruin , and stood up at the end of a wall parallel with the current .
Parsing [sent. 5293 len. 13]: The water was up to Christina 's waist , and very cold .
Parsing [sent. 5294 len. 23]: Here out of the rush , however , she recovered her breath in a measure , and showed not a little courage .
Parsing [sent. 5295 len. 13]: Ian stood between her and the wall , and held her fast .
Parsing [sent. 5296 len. 29]: The torrent came round the end of the wall from both sides , but the encounter and eddy of the two currents rather pushed them up against it .
Parsing [sent. 5297 len. 8]: Without it they could not have stood .
Parsing [sent. 5298 len. 13]: The chief danger to Christina , however , was from the cold .
Parsing [sent. 5299 len. 21]: With the water so high on her body , and flowing so fast , she could not long resist it !
Parsing [sent. 5300 len. 19]: Ian , therefore , took her round the knees , and lifted her almost out of the water .
Parsing [sent. 5301 len. 18]: `` Put your arms up , '' he said , `` and lay hold of the wall .
Parsing [sent. 5302 len. 15]: Do n't mind blinding me ; my eyes are of little use at present .
Parsing [sent. 5303 len. 9]: There -- put your feet in my hands .
Parsing [sent. 5304 len. 11]: Do n't be frightened ; I can hold you . ''
Parsing [sent. 5305 len. 9]: `` I ca n't help being frightened ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5306 len. 3]: she panted .
Parsing [sent. 5307 len. 12]: `` We are in God 's arms , '' returned Ian .
Parsing [sent. 5308 len. 7]: `` He is holding us . ''
Parsing [sent. 5309 len. 11]: `` Are you sure we shall not be drowned ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5310 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 5311 len. 20]: `` No ; but I am sure the water can not take us out of God 's arms . ''
Parsing [sent. 5312 len. 8]: This was not much comfort to Christina .
Parsing [sent. 5313 len. 19]: She did not know anything about God -- did not believe in him any more than most people .
Parsing [sent. 5314 len. 22]: She knew God 's arms only as the arms of Ian -- and THEY comforted her , for she FELT them !
Parsing [sent. 5315 len. 15]: How many of us actually believe in any support we do not immediately feel ?
Parsing [sent. 5316 len. 8]: in any arms we do not see ?
Parsing [sent. 5317 len. 40]: But every help I from God ; Ian 's help was God 's help ; and though to believe in Ian was not to believe in God , it was a step on the road toward believing in God .
Parsing [sent. 5318 len. 26]: He that believeth not in the good man whom he hath seen , how shall he believe in the God whom he hath not seen ?
Parsing [sent. 5319 len. 18]: She began to feel a little better ; the ghastly choking at her heart was almost gone .
Parsing [sent. 5320 len. 8]: `` I shall break your arms ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5321 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 5322 len. 29]: `` You are not very heavy , '' he answered ; `` and though I am not so strong as Alister , I am stronger than most men .
Parsing [sent. 5323 len. 15]: With the help of the wall I can hold you a long time . ''
Parsing [sent. 5324 len. 21]: How was it that , now first in danger , self came less to the front with her than usual ?
Parsing [sent. 5325 len. 13]: It was that now first she was face to face with reality .
Parsing [sent. 5326 len. 12]: Until this moment her life had been an affair of unrealities .
Parsing [sent. 5327 len. 16]: Her selfishness had thinned , as it were vaporized , every reality that approached her .
Parsing [sent. 5328 len. 23]: Solidity is not enough to teach some natures reality ; they must hurt themselves against the solid ere they realize its solidity .
Parsing [sent. 5329 len. 71]: Small reality , small positivity of existence has water to a dreaming soul , half consciously gazing through half shut eyes at the soft river floating away in the moonlight : Christina was shivering in its grasp on her person , its omnipresence to her skin ; its cold made her gasp and choke ; the push and tug of it threatened to sweep her away like a whelmed log !
Parsing [sent. 5330 len. 61]: It is when we are most aware of the FACTITUDE of things , that we are most aware of our need of God , and most able to trust in him ; when most aware of their presence , the soul finds it easiest to withdraw from them , and seek its safety with the maker of it and them .
Parsing [sent. 5331 len. 35]: The recognition of inexorable reality in any shape , or kind , or way , tends to rouse the soul to the yet more real , to its relations with higher and deeper existence .
Parsing [sent. 5332 len. 17]: It is not the hysterical alone for whom the great dash of cold water is good .
Parsing [sent. 5333 len. 14]: All who dream life instead of living it , require some similar shock .
Parsing [sent. 5334 len. 15]: Of the kind is every disappointment , every reverse , every tragedy of life .
Parsing [sent. 5335 len. 41]: The true in even the lowest kind , is of the truth , and to be compelled to feel even that , is to be driven a trifle nearer to the truth of being , of creation , of God .
Parsing [sent. 5336 len. 31]: Hence this sharp contact with Nature tended to make Christina less selfish : it made her forget herself so far as to care for her helper as well as herself .
Parsing [sent. 5337 len. 33]: It must be remembered , however , that her selfishness was not the cultivated and ingrained selfishness of a long life , but that of an uneducated , that is undeveloped nature .
Parsing [sent. 5338 len. 31]: Her being had not degenerated by sinning against light known as light ; it had not been consciously enlightened at all ; it had scarcely as yet begun to grow .
Parsing [sent. 5339 len. 9]: It was not lying dead , only unawaked .
Parsing [sent. 5340 len. 47]: I would not be understood to imply that she was nowise to blame -- but that she was by no means so much to blame as one who has but suspected the presence of a truth , and from selfishness or self-admiration has turned from it .
Parsing [sent. 5341 len. 37]: She was to blame wherever she had not done as her conscience had feebly told her ; and she had not made progress just because she had neglected the little things concerning which she had promptings .
Parsing [sent. 5342 len. 32]: There are many who do not enter the kingdom of heaven just because they will not believe the tiny key that is handed them , fit to open its hospitable gate .
Parsing [sent. 5343 len. 16]: `` Oh , Mr. Ian , if you should be drowned for my sake ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5344 len. 6]: she faltered with white lips .
Parsing [sent. 5345 len. 10]: `` You should not have come to me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5346 len. 13]: `` I would not wish a better death , '' said Ian .
Parsing [sent. 5347 len. 11]: `` How can you talk so coolly about it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5348 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 5349 len. 26]: `` Well , '' he returned , `` what better way of going out of the world is there than by the door of help ?
Parsing [sent. 5350 len. 14]: No man cares much about what the idiots of the world call life !
Parsing [sent. 5351 len. 12]: What is it whether we live in this room or another ?
Parsing [sent. 5352 len. 15]: The same who sent us here , sends for us out of here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5353 len. 7]: `` Most men care very much !
Parsing [sent. 5354 len. 6]: You are wrong there ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5355 len. 11]: `` I do n't call those who do , men !
Parsing [sent. 5356 len. 5]: They are only children !
Parsing [sent. 5357 len. 26]: I know many men who would no more cleave to this life than a butterfly would fold his wings and creep into his deserted chrysalis-case .
Parsing [sent. 5358 len. 15]: I do care to live -- tremendously , but I do n't mind where .
Parsing [sent. 5359 len. 20]: He who made this room so well worth living in , may surely be trusted with the next ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5360 len. 12]: `` I ca n't quite follow you , '' stammered Christina .
Parsing [sent. 5361 len. 5]: `` I am sorry .
Parsing [sent. 5362 len. 6]: Perhaps it is the cold .
Parsing [sent. 5363 len. 13]: I ca n't feel my hands , I am so cold . ''
Parsing [sent. 5364 len. 13]: `` Leave the wall , and put your arms round my neck .
Parsing [sent. 5365 len. 13]: The change will rest me , and the water is already falling !
Parsing [sent. 5366 len. 10]: It will go as rapidly as it came ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5367 len. 8]: `` How do you know that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5368 len. 25]: `` It has sunk nearly a foot in the last fifteen minutes : I have been carefully watching it , you may be sure !
Parsing [sent. 5369 len. 23]: It must have been a waterspout , and however much that may bring , it pours it out all at once . ''
Parsing [sent. 5370 len. 4]: `` Oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5371 len. 20]: said Christina , with a tremulous joyfulness ; `` I thought it would go on ever so long ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5372 len. 9]: `` We shall get out of it alive !
Parsing [sent. 5373 len. 8]: -- God 's will be done ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5374 len. 7]: `` Why do you say that ?
Parsing [sent. 5375 len. 13]: Do n't you really mean we are going to be saved ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5376 len. 15]: `` Would you want to live , if he wanted you to die ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5377 len. 21]: `` Oh , but you forget , Mr. Ian , I am not ready to die , like you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5378 len. 3]: sobbed Christina .
Parsing [sent. 5379 len. 26]: `` Do you think anything could make it better for you to stop here , after God thought it better for you to go ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5380 len. 9]: `` I dare not think about it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5381 len. 23]: `` Be sure God will not take you away , if it be better for you to live here a little longer .
Parsing [sent. 5382 len. 36]: But you will have to go sometime ; and if you contrived to live after God wanted you to go , you would find yourself much less ready when the time came that you must .
Parsing [sent. 5383 len. 24]: But , my dear Miss Palmer , no one can be living a true life , to whom dying is a terror . ''
Parsing [sent. 5384 len. 4]: Christina was silent .
Parsing [sent. 5385 len. 5]: He spoke the truth !
Parsing [sent. 5386 len. 6]: She was not worth anything !
Parsing [sent. 5387 len. 14]: How grand it was to look death in the face with a smile !
Parsing [sent. 5388 len. 43]: If she had been no more than the creature she had hitherto shown herself , not all the floods of the deluge could have made her think or feel thus : her real self , her divine nature had begun to wake .
Parsing [sent. 5389 len. 43]: True , that nature was as yet no more like the divine , than the drowsy , arm-stretching , yawning child is like the merry elf about to spring from his couch , full of life , of play , of love .
Parsing [sent. 5390 len. 21]: She had no faith in God yet , but it was much that she felt she was not worth anything .
Parsing [sent. 5391 len. 17]: You are right : it was odd to hold such a conversation at such a time !
Parsing [sent. 5392 len. 7]: But Ian was an odd man .
Parsing [sent. 5393 len. 20]: He actually believed that God was nearer to him than his own consciousness , yet desired communion with him !
Parsing [sent. 5394 len. 21]: and that Jesus Christ knew what he said when he told his disciples that the Father cared for his sparrows .
Parsing [sent. 5395 len. 15]: Only one human being witnessed their danger , and he could give no help .
Parsing [sent. 5396 len. 29]: Hector of the Stags had crossed the main valley above where the torrent entered it , and coming over the hill , saw with consternation the flood-encompassed pair .
Parsing [sent. 5397 len. 31]: If there had been help in man , he could have brought none ; the raging torrent blocked the way both to the village and to the chief 's house .
Parsing [sent. 5398 len. 13]: He could only stand and gaze with his heart in his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 5399 len. 16]: Beyond the stream lay Mercy on the hillside , with her face in the heather .
Parsing [sent. 5400 len. 10]: Frozen with dread , she dared not look up .
Parsing [sent. 5401 len. 18]: Had she moved but ten yards , she would have seen her sister in Ian 's arms .
Parsing [sent. 5402 len. 26]: The children sat by her , white as death , with great lumps in their throats , and the silent tears rolling down their cheeks .
Parsing [sent. 5403 len. 11]: It was the first time death had come near them .
Parsing [sent. 5404 len. 10]: A sound of sweeping steps came through the heather .
Parsing [sent. 5405 len. 12]: They looked up : there was the chief striding toward them .
Parsing [sent. 5406 len. 17]: The flood had come upon him at work in his fields , whelming his growing crops .
Parsing [sent. 5407 len. 15]: He had but time to unyoke his bulls , and run for his life .
Parsing [sent. 5408 len. 16]: The bulls , not quite equal to the occasion , were caught and swept away .
Parsing [sent. 5409 len. 28]: They were found a week after on the hills , nothing the worse , and nearly as wild as when first the chief took them in hand .
Parsing [sent. 5410 len. 48]: The cottage was in no danger ; and Nancy got a horse and the last of the cows from the farm-yard on to the crest of the ridge , against which the burn rushed roaring , just as the water began to invade the cowhouse and stable .
Parsing [sent. 5411 len. 52]: The moment he reached the ridge , the chief set out to look for his brother , whom he knew to be somewhere up the valley ; and having climbed to get an outlook , saw Mercy and the girls , from whose postures he dreaded that something had befallen them .
Parsing [sent. 5412 len. 21]: The girls uttered a cry of welcome , and the chief answered , but Mercy did not lift her head .
Parsing [sent. 5413 len. 16]: `` Mercy , '' said Alister softly , and kneeling laid his hand on her .
Parsing [sent. 5414 len. 16]: She turned to him such a face of blank misery as filled him with consternation .
Parsing [sent. 5415 len. 6]: `` What has happened ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5416 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 5417 len. 9]: She tried to speak , but could not .
Parsing [sent. 5418 len. 6]: `` Where is Christina ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5419 len. 4]: he went on .
Parsing [sent. 5420 len. 12]: She succeeded in bringing out the one word `` ruin . ''
Parsing [sent. 5421 len. 7]: `` Is anybody with her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5422 len. 4]: `` Ian . ''
Parsing [sent. 5423 len. 4]: `` Oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5424 len. 12]: he returned cheerily , as if then all would be right .
Parsing [sent. 5425 len. 32]: But a pang shot through his heart , and it was as much for himself as for Mercy that he went on : `` But God is with them , Mercy .
Parsing [sent. 5426 len. 11]: If he were not , it would be bad indeed !
Parsing [sent. 5427 len. 9]: Where he is , all is well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5428 len. 17]: She sat up , and putting out her hand , laid it in his great palm .
Parsing [sent. 5429 len. 9]: `` I wish I could believe that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5430 len. 13]: she said ; `` but you know people ARE drowned sometimes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5431 len. 5]: `` Yes , surely !
Parsing [sent. 5432 len. 11]: but if God be with them what does it matter !
Parsing [sent. 5433 len. 17]: It is no worse than when a mother puts her baby into a big bath . ''
Parsing [sent. 5434 len. 17]: `` It is cruel to talk like that to me when my sister is drowning ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5435 len. 14]: She gave a stifled shriek , and threw herself again on her face .
Parsing [sent. 5436 len. 68]: `` Mercy , '' said the chief -- and his voice trembled a little , `` you do not love your sister more than I love my brother , and if he be drowned I shall weep ; but I shall not be miserable as if a mocking devil were at the root of it , and not one who loves them better than we ever shall .
Parsing [sent. 5437 len. 13]: But come ; I think we shall find them somehow alive yet !
Parsing [sent. 5438 len. 25]: Ian knows what to do in an emergency ; and though you might not think it , he is a very strong man . ''
Parsing [sent. 5439 len. 22]: She rose immediately , and taking like a child the hand he offered her , went up the hill with him .
Parsing [sent. 5440 len. 14]: The girls ran before them , and presently gave a scream of joy .
Parsing [sent. 5441 len. 5]: `` I see Chrissy !
Parsing [sent. 5442 len. 5]: I see Chrissy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5443 len. 3]: cried one .
Parsing [sent. 5444 len. 3]: `` Yes !
Parsing [sent. 5445 len. 4]: there she is !
Parsing [sent. 5446 len. 6]: I see her too ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5447 len. 4]: cried the other .
Parsing [sent. 5448 len. 6]: Alister hurried up with Mercy .
Parsing [sent. 5449 len. 4]: There was Christina !
Parsing [sent. 5450 len. 7]: She seemed standing on the water !
Parsing [sent. 5451 len. 5]: Mercy burst into tears .
Parsing [sent. 5452 len. 7]: `` But where 's Ian ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5453 len. 19]: she said , when she had recovered herself a little ; `` I do n't see him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5454 len. 10]: `` He is there though , all right ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5455 len. 3]: answered Alister .
Parsing [sent. 5456 len. 15]: `` Do n't you see his hands holding her out of the water ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5457 len. 13]: And with that he gave a great shout : -- `` Ian !
Parsing [sent. 5458 len. 2]: Ian !
Parsing [sent. 5459 len. 6]: hold on , old boy !
Parsing [sent. 5460 len. 5]: I 'm coming ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5461 len. 19]: Ian heard him , and was filled with terror , but had neither breath nor strength to answer .
Parsing [sent. 5462 len. 31]: Along the hillside went Alister bounding like a deer , then turning sharp , shot headlong down , dashed into the torrent -- and was swept away like a cork .
Parsing [sent. 5463 len. 11]: Mercy gave a scream , and ran down the hill .
Parsing [sent. 5464 len. 9]: He was not carried very far , however .
Parsing [sent. 5465 len. 21]: In a moment or two he had recovered himself , and crept out gasping and laughing , just below Mercy .
Parsing [sent. 5466 len. 5]: Ian did not move .
Parsing [sent. 5467 len. 21]: He was so benumbed that to change his position an inch would , he well knew , be to fall .
Parsing [sent. 5468 len. 8]: And now Hector began to behave oddly .
Parsing [sent. 5469 len. 14]: He threw a stone , which went in front of Ian and Christina .
Parsing [sent. 5470 len. 10]: Then he threw another , which went behind them .
Parsing [sent. 5471 len. 18]: Then he threw a third , and Christina felt her hat caught by a bit of string .
Parsing [sent. 5472 len. 21]: She drew it toward her as fast as numbness would permit , and found at the end a small bottle .
Parsing [sent. 5473 len. 15]: She managed to get it uncorked , and put it to Ian 's lips .
Parsing [sent. 5474 len. 11]: He swallowed a mouthful , and made her take some .
Parsing [sent. 5475 len. 17]: Hector stood on one side , the chief on the other , and watched the proceeding .
Parsing [sent. 5476 len. 9]: `` What would mother say , Alister ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5477 len. 7]: cried Ian across the narrowing water .
Parsing [sent. 5478 len. 54]: In the joy of hearing his voice , Alister rushed again into the torrent ; and , after a fierce struggle , reached the mound , where he scrambled up , and putting his arms round Ian 's legs with a shout , lifted the two at once like a couple of babies .
Parsing [sent. 5479 len. 3]: `` Come !
Parsing [sent. 5480 len. 4]: come , Alister !
Parsing [sent. 5481 len. 6]: do n't be silly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5482 len. 3]: said Ian .
Parsing [sent. 5483 len. 6]: `` Set me down ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5484 len. 8]: `` Give me the girl then . ''
Parsing [sent. 5485 len. 5]: `` Take her ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5486 len. 12]: Christina turned on him a sorrowful gaze as Alister took her .
Parsing [sent. 5487 len. 7]: `` I have killed you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5488 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 5489 len. 13]: `` You have done me the greatest favour , '' he replied .
Parsing [sent. 5490 len. 4]: `` What ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5491 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 5492 len. 5]: `` Accepted help . ''
Parsing [sent. 5493 len. 5]: She burst out crying .
Parsing [sent. 5494 len. 8]: She had not shed a tear before .
Parsing [sent. 5495 len. 20]: `` Get on the top of the wall , Ian , out of the wet , '' said Alister .
Parsing [sent. 5496 len. 17]: `` You ca n't tell what the water may have done to the foundations , Alister !
Parsing [sent. 5497 len. 8]: I would rather not break my leg !
Parsing [sent. 5498 len. 11]: It is so frozen it would never mend again ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5499 len. 23]: As they talked , the torrent had fallen so much , that Hector of the Stags came wading from the other side .
Parsing [sent. 5500 len. 12]: A few minutes more , and Alister carried Christina to Mercy .
Parsing [sent. 5501 len. 17]: `` Now , '' he said , setting her down , `` you must walk . ''
Parsing [sent. 5502 len. 16]: Ian could not cross without Hector 's help ; he seemed to have no legs .
Parsing [sent. 5503 len. 9]: They set out at once for the cottage .
Parsing [sent. 5504 len. 10]: `` How will your crops fare , Alister ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5505 len. 3]: asked Ian .
Parsing [sent. 5506 len. 19]: `` Part will be spoiled , '' replied the chief ; `` part not much the worse . ''
Parsing [sent. 5507 len. 33]: The torrent had rushed half-way up the ridge , then swept along the flank of it , and round the end in huge bulk , to the level on the other side .
Parsing [sent. 5508 len. 8]: The water lay soaking into the fields .
Parsing [sent. 5509 len. 5]: The valley was desolated .
Parsing [sent. 5510 len. 18]: What green things had not been uprooted or carried away with the soil , were laid flat .
Parsing [sent. 5511 len. 22]: Everywhere was mud , and scattered all over were lumps of turf , with heather , brushwood , and small trees .
Parsing [sent. 5512 len. 13]: But it was early in the year , and there was hope !
Parsing [sent. 5513 len. 35]: I will spare the description of the haste and hurrying to and fro in the little house -- the blowing of fires , the steaming pails and blankets , the hot milk and tea !
Parsing [sent. 5514 len. 14]: Mrs. Macruadh rolled up her sleeves , and worked like a good housemaid .
Parsing [sent. 5515 len. 27]: Nancy shot hither and thither on her bare feet like a fawn -- you could not say she ran , and certainly she did not walk .
Parsing [sent. 5516 len. 31]: Alister got Ian to bed , and rubbed him with rough towels -- himself more wet than he , for he had been rolled over and over in the torrent .
Parsing [sent. 5517 len. 9]: Christina fell asleep , and slept many hours .
Parsing [sent. 5518 len. 21]: When she woke , she said she was quite well ; but it was weeks before she was like herself .
Parsing [sent. 5519 len. 11]: I doubt if ever she was quite as strong again .
Parsing [sent. 5520 len. 14]: For some days Ian confessed to an aching in his legs and arms .
Parsing [sent. 5521 len. 22]: It was the cold of the water , he said ; but Alister insisted it was from holding Christina so long .
Parsing [sent. 5522 len. 9]: `` Water could not hurt a highlander ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5523 len. 3]: said Alister .
Parsing [sent. 5524 len. 4]: CHAPTER XIV CHANGE .
Parsing [sent. 5525 len. 31]: Christina walked home without difficulty , but the next day did not leave her bed , and it was a fortnight before she was able to be out of doors .
Parsing [sent. 5526 len. 16]: When Ian and she met , her manner was not quite the same as before .
Parsing [sent. 5527 len. 6]: She seemed a little timid .
Parsing [sent. 5528 len. 43]: As she shook hands with him her eyes fell ; and when they looked up again , as if ashamed of their involuntary retreat , her face was rosy ; but the slight embarrassment disappeared as soon as they began to talk .
Parsing [sent. 5529 len. 20]: No affectation or formality , however , took its place : in respect of Ian her falseness was gone .
Parsing [sent. 5530 len. 39]: The danger she had been in , and her deliverance through the voluntary sharing of it by Ian , had awaked the simpler , the real nature of the girl , hitherto buried in impressions and their responses .
Parsing [sent. 5531 len. 29]: She had lived but as a mirror meant only to reflect the outer world : something of an operative existence was at length beginning to appear in her .
Parsing [sent. 5532 len. 6]: She was growing a woman .
Parsing [sent. 5533 len. 15]: And the first stage in that growth is to become as a little child .
Parsing [sent. 5534 len. 18]: The child , however , did not for some time show her face to any but Ian .
Parsing [sent. 5535 len. 11]: In his presence Christina had no longer self-assertion or wile .
Parsing [sent. 5536 len. 16]: Without seeking his notice she would yet manifest an almost childish willingness to please him .
Parsing [sent. 5537 len. 6]: It was no sudden change .
Parsing [sent. 5538 len. 31]: She had , ever since their adventure , been haunted , both awake and asleep , by his presence , and it had helped her to some discoveries regarding herself .
Parsing [sent. 5539 len. 35]: And the more she grew real , the nearer , that is , that she came to being a PERSON , the more she came under the influence of his truth , his reality .
Parsing [sent. 5540 len. 13]: It is only through live relation to others that any individuality crystallizes .
Parsing [sent. 5541 len. 9]: `` You saved my life , Ian ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5542 len. 9]: she said one evening for the tenth time .
Parsing [sent. 5543 len. 12]: `` It pleased God you should live , '' answered Ian .
Parsing [sent. 5544 len. 19]: `` Then you really think , '' she returned , `` that God interfered to save us ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5545 len. 16]: `` No , I do not ; I do n't think he ever interferes . ''
Parsing [sent. 5546 len. 23]: `` Mr. Sercombe says everything goes by law , and God never interferes ; my father says he does interfere sometimes . ''
Parsing [sent. 5547 len. 15]: `` Would you say a woman interfered in the management of her own house ?
Parsing [sent. 5548 len. 13]: Can one be said to interfere where he is always at work ?
Parsing [sent. 5549 len. 33]: He is the necessity of the universe , ever and always doing the best that can be done , and especially for the individual , for whose sake alone the cosmos exists .
Parsing [sent. 5550 len. 17]: If we had been drowned , we should have given God thanks for saving us . ''
Parsing [sent. 5551 len. 8]: `` I do not understand you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5552 len. 28]: `` Should we not have given thanks to find ourselves lifted out of the cold rushing waters , in which we felt our strength slowly sinking ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5553 len. 6]: `` But you said DROWNED !
Parsing [sent. 5554 len. 14]: How could we have thanked God for deliverance if we were drowned ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5555 len. 3]: `` What !
Parsing [sent. 5556 len. 20]: -- not when we found ourselves above the water , safe and well , and more alive than ever ?
Parsing [sent. 5557 len. 23]: Would it not be a dreadful thing to lie tossed for centuries under the sea-waves to which the torrent had borne us ?
Parsing [sent. 5558 len. 26]: Ah , how few believe in a life beyond , a larger life , more awake , more earnest , more joyous than this ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5559 len. 8]: `` Oh , _ I _ do !
Parsing [sent. 5560 len. 20]: but that is not what one means by LIFE ; that is quite a different kind of thing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5561 len. 12]: `` How do you make out that it is so different ?
Parsing [sent. 5562 len. 17]: If I am I , and you are you , how can it be very different ?
Parsing [sent. 5563 len. 17]: The root of things is individuality , unity of idea , and persistence depends on it .
Parsing [sent. 5564 len. 35]: God is the one perfect individual ; and while this world is his and that world is his , there can be no inconsistency , no violent difference , between there and here . ''
Parsing [sent. 5565 len. 23]: `` Then you must thank God for everything -- thank him if you are drowned , or burnt , or anything ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5566 len. 6]: `` Now you understand me !
Parsing [sent. 5567 len. 8]: That is precisely what I mean . ''
Parsing [sent. 5568 len. 18]: `` Then I can never be good , for I could never bring myself to that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5569 len. 13]: `` You can not bring yourself to it ; no one could .
Parsing [sent. 5570 len. 7]: But we must come to it .
Parsing [sent. 5571 len. 11]: I believe we shall all be brought to it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5572 len. 4]: `` Never me !
Parsing [sent. 5573 len. 7]: I should not wish it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5574 len. 29]: `` You do not wish it ; but you may be brought to wish it ; and without it the end of your being can not be reached .
Parsing [sent. 5575 len. 21]: No one , of course , could ever give thanks for what he did not know or feel as good .
Parsing [sent. 5576 len. 11]: But what IS good must come to be felt good .
Parsing [sent. 5577 len. 21]: Can you suppose that Jesus at any time could not thank his Father for sending him into the world ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5578 len. 15]: `` You speak as if we and he were of the same kind ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5579 len. 38]: `` He and we are so entirely of the same kind , that there is no bliss for him or for you or for me but in being the loving obedient child of the one Father . ''
Parsing [sent. 5580 len. 5]: `` You frighten me !
Parsing [sent. 5581 len. 20]: If I can not get to heaven any other way than that , I shall never get there . ''
Parsing [sent. 5582 len. 17]: `` You will get there , and you will get there that way and no other .
Parsing [sent. 5583 len. 17]: If you could get there any other way , it would be to be miserable . ''
Parsing [sent. 5584 len. 14]: `` Something tells me you speak the truth ; but it is terrible !
Parsing [sent. 5585 len. 7]: I do not like it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5586 len. 4]: `` Naturally . ''
Parsing [sent. 5587 len. 8]: She was on the point of crying .
Parsing [sent. 5588 len. 24]: They were alone in the drawing-room of the cottage , but his mother might enter any moment , and Ian said no more .
Parsing [sent. 5589 len. 28]: It was not a drawing toward the things of peace that was at work in Christina : it was an urging painful sense of separation from Ian .
Parsing [sent. 5590 len. 32]: She had been conscious of some antipathy even toward him , so unlike were her feelings , thoughts , judgments , to his : this feeling had changed to its opposite .
Parsing [sent. 5591 len. 32]: A meeting with Ian was now to Christina the great event of day or week ; but Ian , in love with the dead , never thought of danger to either .
Parsing [sent. 5592 len. 31]: One morning she woke from a sound and dreamless sleep , and getting out of bed , drew aside the curtains , looked out , and then opened her window .
Parsing [sent. 5593 len. 6]: It was a lovely spring-morning .
Parsing [sent. 5594 len. 11]: The birds were singing loud in the fast greening shrubbery .
Parsing [sent. 5595 len. 6]: A soft wind was blowing .
Parsing [sent. 5596 len. 21]: It came to her , and whispered something of which she understood only that it was both lovely and sad .
Parsing [sent. 5597 len. 30]: The sun , but a little way up , was shining over hills and cone-shaped peaks , whose shadows , stretching eagerly westward , were yet ever shortening eastward .
Parsing [sent. 5598 len. 42]: His light was gentle , warm , and humid , as if a little sorrowful , she thought , over his many dead children , that he must call forth so many more to the new life of the reviving year .
Parsing [sent. 5599 len. 89]: Suddenly as she gazed , the little clump of trees against the hillside stood as she had never seen it stand before -- as if the sap in them were no longer colourless , but red with human life ; nature was alive with a presence she had never seen before ; it was instinct with a meaning , an intent , a soul ; the mountains stood against the sky as if reaching upward , knowing something , waiting for something ; over all was a glory .
Parsing [sent. 5600 len. 29]: The change was far more wondrous than from winter to summer ; it was not as if a dead body , but a dead soul had come alive .
Parsing [sent. 5601 len. 5]: What could it mean ?
Parsing [sent. 5602 len. 31]: Had the new aspect come forth to answer this glow in her heart , or was the glow in her heart the reflection of this new aspect of the world ?
Parsing [sent. 5603 len. 31]: She was ready to cry aloud , not with joy , not from her feeling of the beauty , but with a SENSATION almost , hitherto unknown , therefore nameless .
Parsing [sent. 5604 len. 54]: It was a new and marvellous interest in the world , a new sense of life in herself , of life in everything , a recognition of brother-existence , a life-contact with the universe , a conscious flash of the divine in her soul , a throb of the pure joy of being .
Parsing [sent. 5605 len. 11]: She was nearer God than she had ever been before .
Parsing [sent. 5606 len. 44]: But she did not know this -- might never in this world know it ; she understood nothing of what was going on in her , only felt it go on ; it was not love of God that was moving in her .
Parsing [sent. 5607 len. 37]: Yet she stood in her white dress like one risen from the grave , looking in sweet bliss on a new heaven and a new earth , made new by the new opening of her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 5608 len. 36]: To save man or woman , the next thing to the love of God is the love of man or woman ; only let no man or woman mistake the love of love for love !
Parsing [sent. 5609 len. 24]: She started , grew white , stood straight up , grew red as a sunset : -- was it -- could it be ?
Parsing [sent. 5610 len. 7]: -- `` Is this love ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5611 len. 12]: she said to herself , and for minutes she hardly moved .
Parsing [sent. 5612 len. 4]: It was love .
Parsing [sent. 5613 len. 20]: Whether love was in her or not , she was in love -- and it might get inside her .
Parsing [sent. 5614 len. 11]: She hid her face in her hands , and wept .
Parsing [sent. 5615 len. 36]: With what opportunities I have had of studying , I do not say UNDERSTANDING , the human heart , I should not have expected such feeling from Christina -- and she wondered at it herself .
Parsing [sent. 5616 len. 11]: Till a child is awake , how tell his mood ?
Parsing [sent. 5617 len. 12]: -- until a woman is awaked , how tell her nature ?
Parsing [sent. 5618 len. 4]: Who knows himself ?
Parsing [sent. 5619 len. 10]: -- and how then shall he know his neighbour ?
Parsing [sent. 5620 len. 15]: For who can know anything except on the supposition of its remaining the same ?
Parsing [sent. 5621 len. 18]: and the greatest change of all , next to being born again , is beginning to love .
Parsing [sent. 5622 len. 55]: The very faculty of loving had been hitherto repressed in the soul of Christina -- by poor education , by low family and social influences , by familiarity with the worship of riches , by vanity , and consequent hunger after the attentions of men ; but now at length she was in love .
Parsing [sent. 5623 len. 21]: At breakfast , though she was silent , she looked so well that her mother complimented her on her loveliness .
Parsing [sent. 5624 len. 23]: Had she been more of a mother , she might have seen cause for anxiety in this fresh bourgeoning of her beauty .
Parsing [sent. 5625 len. 3]: CHAPTER XV .
Parsing [sent. 5626 len. 3]: LOVE ALLODIAL .
Parsing [sent. 5627 len. 74]: While the chief went on in his humble way , enjoying life and his lowly position ; seeming , in the society of his brother , to walk the outer courts of heaven ; and , unsuspicious of the fact , growing more and more in love with the ill educated , but simple , open , and wise Mercy , a trouble was gathering for him of which he had no presentiment .
Parsing [sent. 5628 len. 36]: We have to be delivered from the evils of which we are unaware as well as from those we hate ; and the chief had to be set free from his unconscious worship of Mammon .
Parsing [sent. 5629 len. 137]: He did not worship Mammon by yielding homage to riches ; he did not make a man 's money his pedestal ; had he been himself a millionaire , he would not have connived at being therefore held in honour ; but , ever consciously aware of the deteriorating condition of the country , and pitifully regarding the hundred and fifty souls who yet looked to him as their head , often turning it over in his mind how to shepherd them should things come to a crisis , his abiding , ever-recurring comfort was the money from the last sale of the property , accumulating ever since , and now to be his in a very few years : he always thought , I say , first of this money and not first of God .
Parsing [sent. 5630 len. 19]: He imagined it an inexhaustible force , a power with which for his clan he could work wonders .
Parsing [sent. 5631 len. 20]: It is the common human mistake to think of money as a force and not as a mere tool .
Parsing [sent. 5632 len. 31]: But he never thought of it otherwise than as belonging to the clan ; never imagined the least liberty to use it save in the direct service of his people .
Parsing [sent. 5633 len. 20]: And all the time , the very shadow of this money was disappearing from the face of the earth !
Parsing [sent. 5634 len. 50]: It had scarcely been deposited where the old laird judged it as safe as in the Bank of England , when schemes and speculations were initiated by the intrusted company which brought into jeopardy everything it held , and things had been going from bad to worse ever since .
Parsing [sent. 5635 len. 94]: Nothing of this was yet known , for the directors had from the first carefully muffled up the truth , avoiding the least economy lest it should be interpreted as hinting at any need of prudence ; living in false show with the very money they were thus lying away , warming and banqueting their innocent neighbours with fuel and wine stolen from their own cellars ; and working worse wrong and more misery under the robe of imputed righteousness , that is , respectability , than could a little army of burglars .
Parsing [sent. 5636 len. 61]: Unawares to a trusting multitude , the vacant eyes of loss were drawing near to stare them out of hope and comfort ; and annihilation had long closed in upon the fund which the chief regarded as the sheet-anchor of his clan : he trusted in Mammon , and Mammon had played him one of his rogue 's - tricks .
Parsing [sent. 5637 len. 44]: The most degrading wrong to ourselves , and the worst eventual wrong to others , is to trust in any thing or person but the living God : it was an evil thing from which the chief had sore need to be delivered .
Parsing [sent. 5638 len. 35]: Even those who help us we must regard as the loving hands of the great heart of the universe , else we do God wrong , and will come to do them wrong also .
Parsing [sent. 5639 len. 18]: And there was more yet of what we call mischief brewing in another quarter to like hurt .
Parsing [sent. 5640 len. 28]: Mr. Peregrine Palmer was not now so rich a man as when he bought his highland property ; also he was involved in affairs of doubtful result .
Parsing [sent. 5641 len. 32]: It was natural , therefore , that he should begin to think of the said property not merely as an ornament of life , but as something to fall back upon .
Parsing [sent. 5642 len. 13]: He feared nothing , however , more unpleasant than a temporary embarrassment .
Parsing [sent. 5643 len. 12]: Had not his family been in the front for three generations !
Parsing [sent. 5644 len. 9]: Had he not a vested right in success !
Parsing [sent. 5645 len. 27]: Had he not a claim for the desire of his heart on whatever power it was that he pictured to himself as throned in the heavens !
Parsing [sent. 5646 len. 68]: It never came into his head that , seeing there were now daughters in the family , it might he worth the while of that Power to make a poor man of him for their sakes ; or that neither he , his predecessors , nor his sons , had ever come near enough to anything human to be fit for having their pleasures taken from them .
Parsing [sent. 5647 len. 28]: But what I have to do with is the new aspect his Scotch acres now put on : he must see to making the best of them !
Parsing [sent. 5648 len. 8]: and that best would be a deer-forest !
Parsing [sent. 5649 len. 12]: He and his next neighbour might together effect something worth doing !
Parsing [sent. 5650 len. 33]: Therefore all crofters or villagers likely to trespass must be got rid of -- and first and foremost the shepherds , for they had endless opportunities of helping themselves to a deer .
Parsing [sent. 5651 len. 17]: Where there were sheep there must be shepherds : they would make a clearance of both !
Parsing [sent. 5652 len. 54]: The neighbour referred to , a certain Mr. Brander , who had made his money by sharp dealing in connection with a great Russian railway , and whom Mr. Peregrine Palmer knew before in London , had enlightened him on many things , and amongst others on the shepherds ' passion for deer-stalking .
Parsing [sent. 5653 len. 43]: Being in the company of the deer , he said , the whole day , and the whole year through , they were thoroughly acquainted with their habits , and were altogether too much both for the deer and for their owners .
Parsing [sent. 5654 len. 52]: A shepherd would take the barrel of his gun from the stock , and thrust it down his back , or put it in a hollow crook , and so convey it to the vicinity of some spot frequented by a particular animal , to lie hidden there for his opportunity .
Parsing [sent. 5655 len. 29]: In the hills it was impossible to tell with certainty whence came the sound of a shot ; and no rascal of them would give information concerning another !
Parsing [sent. 5656 len. 16]: In short , there was no protecting the deer without uprooting and expelling the peasantry !
Parsing [sent. 5657 len. 39]: The village of the Clanruadh was on Mr. Brander 's land , and was dependent in part on the produce of small pieces of ground , the cultivators of which were mostly men with other employment as well .
Parsing [sent. 5658 len. 18]: Some made shoes of the hides , others cloth and clothes of the wool of the country .
Parsing [sent. 5659 len. 20]: Some were hinds on neighbouring farms , but most were shepherds , for there was now very little tillage .
Parsing [sent. 5660 len. 48]: Almost all the land formerly cultivated had been given up to grass and sheep , and not a little of it was steadily returning to that state of nature from which it had been reclaimed , producing heather , ling , blueberries , cnowperts , and cranberries .
Parsing [sent. 5661 len. 38]: The hamlet was too far from the sea for much fishing , but some of its inhabitants would join relatives on the coast and go fishing with them , when there was nothing else to be done .
Parsing [sent. 5662 len. 107]: But many of those who looked to the sea for help had lately come through a hard time , in which they would have died but for the sea-weed and shellfish the shore afforded them ; yet such was their spirit of independence that a commission appointed to inquire into their necessity , found scarcely one willing to acknowledge any want : such was the class of men and women now doomed , at the will of two common-minded , greedy men , to expulsion from the houses and land they had held for generations , and loved with a love unintelligible to their mean-souled oppressors .
Parsing [sent. 5663 len. 37]: Ian , having himself learned the lesson that , so long as a man is dependent on anything earthly , he is not a free man , was very desirous to have his brother free also .
Parsing [sent. 5664 len. 33]: He could not be satisfied to leave the matter where , on their way home that night from THE TOMB , as they called their cave-house , their talk had left it .
Parsing [sent. 5665 len. 53]: Alister 's love of the material world , of the soil of his ancestral acres , was , Ian plainly saw , not yet one with the meaning and will of God : he was not yet content that the home of his fathers should fare as the father of fathers pleased .
Parsing [sent. 5666 len. 20]: He was therefore on the outlook for the right opportunity of having another talk with him on the subject .
Parsing [sent. 5667 len. 23]: That those who are trying to be good are more continuously troubled than the indifferent , has for ages been a puzzle .
Parsing [sent. 5668 len. 36]: `` I saw the wicked spreading like a green bay tree , '' says king David ; and he was far from having fathomed the mystery when he got his mind at rest about it .
Parsing [sent. 5669 len. 11]: Is it not simply that the righteous are worth troubling ?
Parsing [sent. 5670 len. 11]: that they are capable of receiving good from being troubled ?
Parsing [sent. 5671 len. 13]: As a man advances , more and more is required of him .
Parsing [sent. 5672 len. 21]: A wrong thing in the good man becomes more and more wrong as he draws nearer to freedom from it .
Parsing [sent. 5673 len. 22]: His friends may say how seldom he offends ; but every time he offends , he is the more to blame .
Parsing [sent. 5674 len. 27]: Some are allowed to go on because it would be of no use to stop them yet ; nothing would yet make them listen to wisdom .
Parsing [sent. 5675 len. 33]: There must be many who , like Dives , need the bitter contrast between the good things of this life and the evil things of the next , to wake them up .
Parsing [sent. 5676 len. 33]: In this life they are not only fools , and insist on being treated as fools , but would have God consent to treat them as if he too had no wisdom !
Parsing [sent. 5677 len. 36]: The laird was one in whom was no guile , but he was far from perfect : any man is far from perfect whose sense of well-being could be altered by any change of circumstance .
Parsing [sent. 5678 len. 28]: A man unable to do without this thing or that , is not yet in sight of his perfection , therefore not out of sight of suffering .
Parsing [sent. 5679 len. 21]: They who do not know suffering , may well doubt if they have yet started on the way TO BE .
Parsing [sent. 5680 len. 34]: If clouds were gathering to burst in fierce hail on the head of the chief , it was that he might be set free from yet another of the cords that bound him .
Parsing [sent. 5681 len. 34]: He was like a soaring eagle from whose foot hung , trailing on the earth , the line by which his tyrant could at his will pull him back to his inglorious perch .
Parsing [sent. 5682 len. 11]: To worship truly is to treat according to indwelling worth .
Parsing [sent. 5683 len. 21]: The highest worship of Nature is to worship toward it , as David and Daniel worshipped toward the holy place .
Parsing [sent. 5684 len. 22]: But even the worship of Nature herself might be an ennobling idolatry , so much is the divine present in her .
Parsing [sent. 5685 len. 48]: There is an intense , almost sensuous love of Nature , such as the chief confessed to his brother , which is not only one with love to the soul of Nature , but tends to lift the soul of man up to the lord of Nature .
Parsing [sent. 5686 len. 27]: To love the soul of Nature , however , does not secure a man from loving the body of Nature in the low Mammon-way of possession .
Parsing [sent. 5687 len. 30]: A man who loves the earth even as the meek love it , may also love it in a way hostile to such possession of it as is theirs .
Parsing [sent. 5688 len. 25]: The love of possessing as property , must , unchecked , come in time to annihilate in a man the inheritance of the meek .
Parsing [sent. 5689 len. 45]: A few acres of good valley-land , with a small upland pasturage , and a space of barren hill-country , had developed in the chief a greater love of the land as a possession than would have come of entrance upon an undiminished inheritance .
Parsing [sent. 5690 len. 19]: He clave to the ground remaining to him , as to the last remnant of a vanishing good .
Parsing [sent. 5691 len. 20]: One day the brothers were lying on the westward slope of the ridge , in front of the cottage .
Parsing [sent. 5692 len. 32]: A few sheep , small , active , black-faced , were feeding around them : it was no use running away , for the chief 's colley was lying beside him !
Parsing [sent. 5693 len. 35]: The laird every now and then buried his face in the short sweet mountain-grass-like that of the clowns in England , not like the rich sown grass on the cultivated bank of the burn .
Parsing [sent. 5694 len. 26]: `` I believe I love the grass , '' he said , `` as much , Ian , as your Chaucer loved the daisy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5695 len. 10]: `` Hardly so much , I should think ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5696 len. 3]: returned Ian .
Parsing [sent. 5697 len. 8]: `` Why do you think so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5698 len. 15]: `` I doubt if grass can be loved so much as a flower . ''
Parsing [sent. 5699 len. 5]: `` Why not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5700 len. 14]: `` Because the one is a mass , the other an individual . ''
Parsing [sent. 5701 len. 5]: `` I understand . ''
Parsing [sent. 5702 len. 24]: `` I have a fear , Alister , that you are in danger of avarice , '' said Ian , after a pause .
Parsing [sent. 5703 len. 5]: `` Avarice , Ian !
Parsing [sent. 5704 len. 6]: What can you mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5705 len. 27]: `` You are as free , Alister , from the love of money , as any man I ever knew , but that is not enough .
Parsing [sent. 5706 len. 13]: Did you ever think of the origin of the word AVARICE ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5707 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 5708 len. 22]: `` It comes -- at least it seems to me to come -- from the same root as the verb HAVE .
Parsing [sent. 5709 len. 40]: It is the desire to call THINGS ours -- the desire of company which is not of our kind -- company such as , if small enough , you would put in your pocket and carry about with you .
Parsing [sent. 5710 len. 42]: We call the holding in the hand , or the house , or the pocket , or the power , HAVING ; but things so held can not really be HAD ; HAVING is but an illusion in regard to THINGS .
Parsing [sent. 5711 len. 33]: It is only what we can be WITH that we can really possess -- that is , what is of our kind , from God to the lowest animal partaking of humanity .
Parsing [sent. 5712 len. 24]: A love can never be lost ; it is a possession ; but who can take his diamond ring into the somewhere beyond ?
Parsing [sent. 5713 len. 7]: -- it is not a possession .
Parsing [sent. 5714 len. 17]: God only can be ours perfectly ; nothing called property can be ours at all . ''
Parsing [sent. 5715 len. 29]: `` I know it -- with my head at least , '' said Alister ; `` but I am not sure how you apply it to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 5716 len. 13]: `` You love your country -- do n't you , Alister ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5717 len. 5]: `` I do . ''
Parsing [sent. 5718 len. 11]: `` What do you mean by LOVING YOUR COUNTRY ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5719 len. 10]: `` It is hard to say all at once .
Parsing [sent. 5720 len. 22]: The first thing that comes to me is , that I would rather live in it than in any other . ''
Parsing [sent. 5721 len. 16]: `` Would you care to vaunt your country at the expense of any other ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5722 len. 21]: `` Not if it did not plainly excel -- and even then it might be neither modest nor polite ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5723 len. 17]: `` Would you feel bound to love a man more because he was a fellow-countryman ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5724 len. 13]: `` Other things being equal , I could not help it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5725 len. 10]: `` Other things not being equal , -- ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5726 len. 14]: `` I should love the best man best -- Scotsman or negro . ''
Parsing [sent. 5727 len. 9]: `` That is as I thought of you .
Parsing [sent. 5728 len. 27]: For my part , my love for my own people has taught me to love every man , be his colour or country what it may .
Parsing [sent. 5729 len. 21]: The man whose patriotism is not leading him in that direction has not yet begun to be a true patriot .
Parsing [sent. 5730 len. 20]: Let him go to St. Paul and learn , or stay in his own cellar and be an idiot .
Parsing [sent. 5731 len. 28]: -- But now , from loving our country , let us go down the other way : -- Do you love the highlands or the lowlands best ?
Parsing [sent. 5732 len. 11]: You love the highlands , of course , you say .
Parsing [sent. 5733 len. 8]: And what district do you like best ?
Parsing [sent. 5734 len. 3]: Our own .
Parsing [sent. 5735 len. 3]: What parish ?
Parsing [sent. 5736 len. 4]: Your father 's .
Parsing [sent. 5737 len. 6]: What part of the parish ?
Parsing [sent. 5738 len. 11]: Why this , where at this moment we are lying .
Parsing [sent. 5739 len. 38]: Now let me ask , have you , by your love for this piece of the world , which you will allow me to call ours , learned to love the whole world in like fashion ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5740 len. 7]: `` I can not say so .
Parsing [sent. 5741 len. 30]: I do not think we can love the whole world in the same way as our own part of it -- the part where we were born and bred !
Parsing [sent. 5742 len. 10]: It is a portion of our very being . ''
Parsing [sent. 5743 len. 38]: `` If your love to what we call our own land is a love that can not spread , it seems to me of a questionable kind -- of a kind involving the false notion of HAVING ?
Parsing [sent. 5744 len. 23]: The love that is eternal is alone true , and that is the love of the essential , which is the universal .
Parsing [sent. 5745 len. 40]: We love indeed individuals , even to their peculiarities , but only BECAUSE of what lies under and is the life of them -- what they share with every other , the eternal God-born humanity WHICH IS THE PERSON .
Parsing [sent. 5746 len. 8]: Without this humanity where were your friend ?
Parsing [sent. 5747 len. 13]: Mind , I mean no abstraction , but the live individual humanity .
Parsing [sent. 5748 len. 9]: Do you see what I am driving at ?
Parsing [sent. 5749 len. 23]: I would extend my love of the world to all the worlds ; my love of humanity to all that inhabit them .
Parsing [sent. 5750 len. 43]: I want , from being a Scotsman , to be a Briton , then a European , then a cosmopolitan , then a dweller of the universe , a lover of all the worlds I see , and shall one day know .
Parsing [sent. 5751 len. 30]: In the face of such a hope , I find my love for this ground of my father 's -- not indeed less than before , but very small .
Parsing [sent. 5752 len. 17]: It has served its purpose in having begun in me love of the revelation of God .
Parsing [sent. 5753 len. 18]: Wherever I see the beauty of the Lord , that shall be to me his holy temple .
Parsing [sent. 5754 len. 34]: Our Lord was sent first to the lost sheep of the house of Israel : - how would you bear to be told that he loved them more than Africans or Scotsmen ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5755 len. 8]: `` I could not bear it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5756 len. 43]: `` Then , Alister , do you not see that the love of our mother earth is meant to be but a beginning ; and that such love as yours for the land belongs to that love of things which must perish ?
Parsing [sent. 5757 len. 30]: You seem to me not to allow it to blossom , but to keep it a hard bud ; and a bud that will not blossom is a coffin .
Parsing [sent. 5758 len. 31]: A flower is a completed idea , a thought of God , a creature whose body is most perishable , bat whose soul , its idea , can not die .
Parsing [sent. 5759 len. 17]: With the idea of it in you , the withering of the flower you can bear .
Parsing [sent. 5760 len. 8]: The God in it is yours always .
Parsing [sent. 5761 len. 22]: Every spring you welcome the daisy anew ; every time the primrose departs , it grows more dear by its death .
Parsing [sent. 5762 len. 31]: I say there must be a better way of loving the ground on which we were born , than that whence the loss of it would cause us torture . ''
Parsing [sent. 5763 len. 9]: Alister listened as to a prophecy of evil .
Parsing [sent. 5764 len. 35]: `` Rather than that cottage and those fields should pass into the hands of others , '' he said , almost fiercely , `` I would see them sunk in a roaring tide ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5765 len. 8]: Ian rose , and walked slowly away .
Parsing [sent. 5766 len. 9]: Alister lay clutching the ground with his hands .
Parsing [sent. 5767 len. 13]: For a passing moment Ian felt as if he had lost him .
Parsing [sent. 5768 len. 20]: `` Lord , save him from this demon-love , '' he said , and sat down among the pines .
Parsing [sent. 5769 len. 10]: In a few minutes , Alister came to him .
Parsing [sent. 5770 len. 47]: `` You can not mean , Ian , '' he said-and his face was white through all its brown , `` that I am to think no more of the fields of my fathers than of any other ground on the face of the earth ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5771 len. 38]: `` Think of them as the ground God gave to our fathers , which God may see fit to take from us again , and I shall be content -- for the present , '' answered Ian .
Parsing [sent. 5772 len. 12]: `` Do not be vexed with me , '' cried Alister .
Parsing [sent. 5773 len. 27]: `` I want to think as well as do what is right ; but you can not know how I feel or you would spare me .
Parsing [sent. 5774 len. 11]: I love the very stones and clods of the land !
Parsing [sent. 5775 len. 37]: The place is to me as Jerusalem to the Jews : -- you know what the psalm says : -- Thy saints take pleasure in her stones , Her very dust to them is dear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5776 len. 19]: `` They loved their land as theirs , '' said Ian , `` and have lost it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5777 len. 11]: `` I know I must be cast out of it !
Parsing [sent. 5778 len. 32]: I know I must die and go from it ; but I shall come back and wander about the fields and the hills with you and our father and mother ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5779 len. 9]: `` And how about horse and dog ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5780 len. 15]: asked Ian , willing to divert his thoughts for a moment , `` Well !
Parsing [sent. 5781 len. 20]: Daoimean and Luath are so good that I ` do n't see why I should not have them ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5782 len. 7]: `` No more do I ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5783 len. 3]: responded Ian .
Parsing [sent. 5784 len. 25]: `` We may be sure God will either let you have them , or show you reason to content you for not having them .
Parsing [sent. 5785 len. 23]: No love of any thing is to be put in the same thought-pocket with love for the poorest creature that has life .
Parsing [sent. 5786 len. 21]: But I am sometimes not a little afraid lest your love for the soil get right in to your soul .
Parsing [sent. 5787 len. 8]: We are here but pilgrims and strangers .
Parsing [sent. 5788 len. 17]: God did not make the world to be dwelt in , but to be journeyed through .
Parsing [sent. 5789 len. 13]: We must not love it as he did not mean we should .
Parsing [sent. 5790 len. 22]: If we do , he may have great trouble and we much hurt ere we are set free from that love .
Parsing [sent. 5791 len. 20]: Alister , would you willingly walk out of the house to follow him up and down for ever ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5792 len. 36]: `` I do n't know about willingly , '' replied Alister , `` but if I were sure it was he calling me , I am sure I would walk out and follow him . ''
Parsing [sent. 5793 len. 26]: `` What if your love of house and lands prevented you from being sure , when he called you , that it was he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5794 len. 6]: `` That would be terrible !
Parsing [sent. 5795 len. 8]: But he would not leave me so .
Parsing [sent. 5796 len. 10]: He would not forsake me in my ignorance ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5797 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 5798 len. 15]: Having to take you from everything , he would take everything from you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5799 len. 6]: Alister went into the house .
Parsing [sent. 5800 len. 16]: He did not know how much of the worldly mingled with the true in him .
Parsing [sent. 5801 len. 56]: He loved his people , and was unselfishly intent on helping them to the utmost ; but the thought that he was their chief was no small satisfaction to him ; and if the relation between them was a grand one , self had there the more soil wherein to spread its creeping choke-grass roots .
Parsing [sent. 5802 len. 13]: In like manner , his love of nature nourished the parasite possession .
Parsing [sent. 5803 len. 50]: He had but those bare hill-sides , and those few rich acres , yet when , from his ejrry on the hill-top , he looked down among the valleys , his heart would murmur within him , `` From my feet the brook flows gurgling to water my fields !
Parsing [sent. 5804 len. 9]: The wild moors around me feed my sheep !
Parsing [sent. 5805 len. 8]: Yon glen is full of my people !
Parsing [sent. 5806 len. 17]: `` Even with the pure smell of the earth , mingled the sense of its possession .
Parsing [sent. 5807 len. 62]: When , stepping from his cave-house , he saw the sun rise on the out - stretched grandeur of the mountain-world , and felt the earth a new creation as truly as when Adam first opened his eyes on its glory , his heart would give one little heave more at the thought that a portion of it was his own .
Parsing [sent. 5808 len. 12]: But all is man 's only because it is God 's .
Parsing [sent. 5809 len. 35]: The true possession of anything is to see and feel in it what God made it for ; and the uplifting of the soul by that knowledge , is the joy of true having .
Parsing [sent. 5810 len. 9]: The Lord had no land of his own .
Parsing [sent. 5811 len. 35]: He did not care to have it , any more than the twelve legions of angels he would not pray for : his pupils must not care for things he did not care for .
Parsing [sent. 5812 len. 17]: He had no place to lay his head in-had not even a grave of his own .
Parsing [sent. 5813 len. 15]: For want of a boat he had once to walk the rough Galilean sea .
Parsing [sent. 5814 len. 26]: True , he might have gone with the rest , but he had to stop behind to pray : he could not do without that .
Parsing [sent. 5815 len. 17]: Once he sent a fish to fetch him money , but only to pay a tax .
Parsing [sent. 5816 len. 22]: He had even to borrow the few loaves and little fishes from a boy , to feed his five thousand with .
Parsing [sent. 5817 len. 29]: The half-hour which Alister spent in the silence of his chamber , served him well : a ray as of light polarized entered his soul in its gloom .
Parsing [sent. 5818 len. 18]: He returned to Ian , who had been all the time walking up and down the ridge .
Parsing [sent. 5819 len. 8]: `` You are right , Ian ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5820 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 5821 len. 7]: `` I do love the world !
Parsing [sent. 5822 len. 14]: If I were deprived of what I hold , I should doubt God !
Parsing [sent. 5823 len. 21]: I fear , oh , I fear , Ian , he is going to take the land from me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5824 len. 12]: `` We must never fear the will of God , Alister !
Parsing [sent. 5825 len. 21]: We are not right until we can pray heartily , not say submissively , ` Thy will be done ! '
Parsing [sent. 5826 len. 10]: We have not one interest , and God another .
Parsing [sent. 5827 len. 21]: When we wish what he does not wish , we are not more against him than against our real selves .
Parsing [sent. 5828 len. 25]: We are traitors to the human when we think anything but the will of God desirable , when we fear our very life . ''
Parsing [sent. 5829 len. 13]: It was getting toward summer , and the days were growing longer .
Parsing [sent. 5830 len. 11]: `` Let us spend a night in the tomb ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5831 len. 13]: said Ian ; and they fixed a day in the following week .
Parsing [sent. 5832 len. 3]: CHAPTER XVI .
Parsing [sent. 5833 len. 5]: MEECY CALLS ON GEANNIE .
Parsing [sent. 5834 len. 56]: Although the subject did not again come up , Mercy had not forgotten what Ian had said about listening for the word of Nature , and had resolved to get away the first time she could , and see whether Grannie , as Ian had called her , would have anything to do with her .
Parsing [sent. 5835 len. 18]: It were hard to say what she expected -- something half magical rather than anything quite natural .
Parsing [sent. 5836 len. 30]: The notions people have of spiritual influence are so unlike the facts , that , when it begins they never recognize it , but imagine something common at work .
Parsing [sent. 5837 len. 25]: When the Lord came , those who were looking for him did not know him : -- was he not a man like themselves !
Parsing [sent. 5838 len. 9]: did they not know his father and mother !
Parsing [sent. 5839 len. 22]: It was a fine spring morning when Mercy left the house to seek an interview with Nature somewhere among the hills .
Parsing [sent. 5840 len. 19]: She took a path she knew well , and then struck into a sheep-track she had never tried .
Parsing [sent. 5841 len. 30]: Up and up she climbed , nor spent a thought on the sudden changes to which at that season , and amongst those hills , the weather is subject .
Parsing [sent. 5842 len. 32]: With no anxiety as to how she might fare , she was yet already not without some awe : she was at length on her pilgrimage to the temple of Isis !
Parsing [sent. 5843 len. 17]: Not until she was beyond sight of any house , did she begin to feel alone .
Parsing [sent. 5844 len. 12]: It was a new sensation , and of a mingled sort .
Parsing [sent. 5845 len. 30]: But the slight sense of anxiety and fear that made part of it , was soon overpowered by something not unlike the exhilaration of a child escaped from school .
Parsing [sent. 5846 len. 21]: This grew and grew until she felt like a wild thing that had been caught , and had broken loose .
Parsing [sent. 5847 len. 20]: Now first , almost , she seemed to have begun to live , for now first was she free !
Parsing [sent. 5848 len. 17]: She might lie in the heather , walk in the stream , do as she pleased !
Parsing [sent. 5849 len. 13]: No one would interfere with her , no one say Do n't !
Parsing [sent. 5850 len. 23]: She felt stronger and fresher than ever in her life ; and the farther she went , the greater grew the pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 5851 len. 33]: The little burn up whose banks , now the one and now the other , she was walking , kept on welcoming her unaccustomed feet to the realms of solitude and liberty .
Parsing [sent. 5852 len. 30]: For ever it seemed coming to meet her , hasting , running steep , as if straight out of the heaven to which she was drawing nearer and nearer .
Parsing [sent. 5853 len. 17]: The wind woke now and then , and blew on her for a moment , as .
Parsing [sent. 5854 len. 24]: if tasting her , to see what this young Psyche was that had floated up into the wild thin air of the hills .
Parsing [sent. 5855 len. 26]: The incessant meeting of the brook made it a companion to her although it could not go her way , and was always leaving her .
Parsing [sent. 5856 len. 39]: But it kept her from the utter loneliness she sought ; for loneliness is imperfect while sound is by , especially a sing-sound , and the brook was one of Nature 's self -- playing song -- instruments .
Parsing [sent. 5857 len. 36]: But she came at length to a point where the ground was too rough to let her follow its path any more , and turning from it , she began to climb a steep ridge .
Parsing [sent. 5858 len. 30]: The growing and deepening silence as she went farther and farther from the brook , promised the very place for her purpose on the top of the heathery ridge .
Parsing [sent. 5859 len. 23]: But when she reached it and looked behind her , lo , the valley she had left lay at her very feet !
Parsing [sent. 5860 len. 9]: The world had rushed after and caught her !
Parsing [sent. 5861 len. 8]: She had not got away from it !
Parsing [sent. 5862 len. 6]: It was like being enchanted !
Parsing [sent. 5863 len. 28]: She thought she was leaving it far behind , but the nature she sought to escape that she might find Nature , would not let her go !
Parsing [sent. 5864 len. 25]: It kept following her as if to see that she fell into no snare , neither was too sternly received by the loftier spaces .
Parsing [sent. 5865 len. 24]: She could distinguish one of the laird 's men , ploughing in the valley below : she knew him by his red waistcoat !
Parsing [sent. 5866 len. 29]: Almost fiercely she turned and made for the next ridge : it would screen her from the world she had left ; it should not spy upon her !
Parsing [sent. 5867 len. 11]: The danger of losing her way back never suggested itself .
Parsing [sent. 5868 len. 34]: She had not learned that the look of things as you go , is not their look when you turn to go back ; that with your attitude their mood will have altered .
Parsing [sent. 5869 len. 18]: Nature is like a lobster-pot : she lets you easily go on , but not easily return .
Parsing [sent. 5870 len. 22]: When she gained the summit of the second ridge , she looked abroad on a country of which she knew nothing .
Parsing [sent. 5871 len. 10]: It was like the face of an utter stranger .
Parsing [sent. 5872 len. 4]: Not far beyond .
Parsing [sent. 5873 len. 15]: rose yet another ridge : she must see how the world looked from that !
Parsing [sent. 5874 len. 22]: On and on she went , crossing ridge after ridge , but no place invited her to stay and be still .
Parsing [sent. 5875 len. 34]: She found she was weary , and spying in the midst of some short heather a great stone , sat down , and gave herself up to the rest that stole upon her .
Parsing [sent. 5876 len. 32]: Though the sun was warm , the air was keen , and , hot with climbing , she turned her face to it , and drank in its refreshing with delight .
Parsing [sent. 5877 len. 40]: She looked around ; not a trace of humanity was visible-nothing but brown and gray and green hills , with the clear sky over her head , and in the north a black cloud creeping up from the horizon .
Parsing [sent. 5878 len. 25]: Another sense than that of rest awoke in her ; now first in her life the sense of loneliness absolute began to possess her .
Parsing [sent. 5879 len. 50]: And therewith suddenly descended upon her a farther something she had never known ; it was as if the loneliness , or what is the same thing , the presence of her own being without another to qualify and make it reasonable and endurable , seized and held her .
Parsing [sent. 5880 len. 19]: The silence gathered substance , grew as it were solid , and closing upon her , imprisoned her .
Parsing [sent. 5881 len. 47]: Was it not rather that the Soul of Nature , unprevented , unthwarted by distracting influences , found a freer entrance to hers , but she , not yet in harmony with it , felt its con - tact as alien-as bondage therefore and not liberty ?
Parsing [sent. 5882 len. 25]: She was nearer than ever she had been to knowing the presence of the God who is always nearer to us than aught else .
Parsing [sent. 5883 len. 30]: Yea , something seemed , through the very persistence of its silence , to say to her at last , and keep saying , `` Here I am ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5884 len. 13]: She looked behind her in sudden terror : 110 form was there .
Parsing [sent. 5885 len. 41]: She sent out her gaze to the horizon : the huge waves of the solid earth stood up against the sky , sinking so slowly she could not see them sink : they stood mouldering away , biding their time .
Parsing [sent. 5886 len. 35]: They were of those `` who only stand and wait , '' fulfilling the will of him who set them to crumble till the hour of the new heavens and the new earth arrive .
Parsing [sent. 5887 len. 14]: There was no visible life between her and the great silent mouldering hills .
Parsing [sent. 5888 len. 32]: On her right hand lay a blue segment of the ever restless sea , but so far that its commotion seemed a yet deeper rest than that of the immovable hills .
Parsing [sent. 5889 len. 15]: She sat and sat , but nothing came , nothing seemed coming to her .
Parsing [sent. 5890 len. 12]: The hope Ian had given her was not to be fulfilled !
Parsing [sent. 5891 len. 7]: For here there was no revelation !
Parsing [sent. 5892 len. 11]: She was not of the kind Nature could speak to !
Parsing [sent. 5893 len. 42]: She began to grow uncomfortable -- to feel as if she had done something wrong -- as if she was a child put into the corner -- a corner of the great universe , to learn to be sorry for something .
Parsing [sent. 5894 len. 8]: Certainly something was wrong with her-but what ?
Parsing [sent. 5895 len. 7]: Why did she feel so uncomfortable ?
Parsing [sent. 5896 len. 9]: Was she so silly as mind being alone ?
Parsing [sent. 5897 len. 11]: There was nothing in these mountains that would hurt her !
Parsing [sent. 5898 len. 15]: The red deer were ^ sometimes dangerous , but none were even within sight !
Parsing [sent. 5899 len. 9]: Yet something like fear was growing in her !
Parsing [sent. 5900 len. 6]: Why should she be afraid ?
Parsing [sent. 5901 len. 32]: Everything about her certainly did look strange , as if she had nothing to do with it , and it had nothing to do with her ; but that was all !
Parsing [sent. 5902 len. 6]: Ian Macruadh must be wrong !
Parsing [sent. 5903 len. 31]: How could there be any such bond as he said between Nature and the human heart , when the first thing she felt when alone with her , was fear !
Parsing [sent. 5904 len. 7]: The world was staring at her !
Parsing [sent. 5905 len. 14]: She was the centre of a fixed , stony regard from all sides !
Parsing [sent. 5906 len. 15]: The earth , and the sea , and the sky , were watching her !
Parsing [sent. 5907 len. 6]: She did not like it !
Parsing [sent. 5908 len. 9]: She would rise and shake off the fancy !
Parsing [sent. 5909 len. 13]: But she did not rise ; something held her to her thinking .
Parsing [sent. 5910 len. 37]: Just so she would , when a child in the dark , stand afraid to move lest the fear itself , lying in wait like a tigress , should at her first motion pounce upon her .
Parsing [sent. 5911 len. 6]: The terrible , persistent silence !
Parsing [sent. 5912 len. 6]: -- would nothing break it !
Parsing [sent. 5913 len. 55]: And there was in herself a response to it -- something that was in league with it , and kept telling her that things were not all right with her ; that she ought not to be afraid , yet had good reason for being afraid ; that she knew of no essential safety .
Parsing [sent. 5914 len. 25]: There must be some refuge , some impregnable hiding-place , for the thing was a necessity , and she ought to know of it !
Parsing [sent. 5915 len. 19]: There must be a human condition of never being afraid , of knowing nothing to be afraid of !
Parsing [sent. 5916 len. 37]: She wondered whether , if she were quite good , went to church twice every Sunday , and read her bible every morning , she would come not to be afraid of-she did not know what .
Parsing [sent. 5917 len. 13]: It would be grand to have no fear of person or thing !
Parsing [sent. 5918 len. 16]: She was sometimes afraid of her own father , even when she knew no reason !
Parsing [sent. 5919 len. 11]: How that mountain with the horn kept staring at her !
Parsing [sent. 5920 len. 5]: It was all nonsense !
Parsing [sent. 5921 len. 4]: She was silly !
Parsing [sent. 5922 len. 13]: She would get up and go home : it must be time !
Parsing [sent. 5923 len. 9]: But things were not as they should be !
Parsing [sent. 5924 len. 6]: Something was required of her !
Parsing [sent. 5925 len. 9]: Was it God wanting her to do something ?
Parsing [sent. 5926 len. 11]: She had never thought whether he required anything of her !
Parsing [sent. 5927 len. 7]: She must be a better girl !
Parsing [sent. 5928 len. 13]: Then she would have God with her , and not be afraid !
Parsing [sent. 5929 len. 15]: And all the time it was God near her that was making her unhappy .
Parsing [sent. 5930 len. 48]: For , as the Son of Man came not to send peace on the earth but a sword , so the first visit of God to the human soul is generally in a cloud of fear and doubt , rising from the soul itself at his approach .
Parsing [sent. 5931 len. 23]: The sun is the cloud-dispeller , yet often he must look through a fog if he would visit the earth at all .
Parsing [sent. 5932 len. 14]: The child , not being a son , does not know his father .
Parsing [sent. 5933 len. 20]: He may know he is what is called a father ; what the word means he does not know .
Parsing [sent. 5934 len. 23]: How then should he understand when the father comes to deliver him from his paltry self , and give him life indeed !
Parsing [sent. 5935 len. 5]: She tried to pray .
Parsing [sent. 5936 len. 9]: She said , `` Oh G -- od !
Parsing [sent. 5937 len. 8]: forgive me , and make me good .
Parsing [sent. 5938 len. 7]: I want to be good ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5939 len. 4]: Then she rose .
Parsing [sent. 5940 len. 27]: She went some little way without thinking where she was going , and then found she did not even know from what direction she had come .
Parsing [sent. 5941 len. 21]: A sharp new fear , quite different from the former , now shot through her heart : she was lost !
Parsing [sent. 5942 len. 10]: She had told no one she was going anywhere !
Parsing [sent. 5943 len. 12]: No one would have a notion where to look for her !
Parsing [sent. 5944 len. 14]: She had been beginning to feel hungry , but fear drove hunger away .
Parsing [sent. 5945 len. 11]: All she knew was that she must not stay there .
Parsing [sent. 5946 len. 18]: Here was nowhere ; walking on she might come somewhere -- that is , among human beings !
Parsing [sent. 5947 len. 18]: So out she set on her weary travel from no-where to somewhere , giving Nature little thanks .
Parsing [sent. 5948 len. 36]: She did not suspect that her grandmother had been doing anything for her by the space around her , or that now , by the tracklessness , the lostness , she was doing yet more .
Parsing [sent. 5949 len. 30]: On and on she walked , climbing the one hillside and descending the other , going she knew not whither , hardly hoping she drew one step nearer home .
Parsing [sent. 5950 len. 9]: All at once her strength went from her .
Parsing [sent. 5951 len. 6]: She sat down and cried .
Parsing [sent. 5952 len. 17]: But with her tears came the thought how the chief and his brother talked of God .
Parsing [sent. 5953 len. 18]: She remembered she had heard in church that men ought to cry to God in their troubles .
Parsing [sent. 5954 len. 35]: Broken verses of a certain psalm came to her , saying God delivered those who cried to him even from things they had brought on themselves , and she had been doing nothing wrong !
Parsing [sent. 5955 len. 22]: She tried to trust in him , but could not : he was as far from her as the blue heavens !
Parsing [sent. 5956 len. 24]: True , it bent over all , but its one great eye was much too large to see the trouble she was in !
Parsing [sent. 5957 len. 20]: What did it matter to the blue sky if she fell down and withered up to bones and dust !
Parsing [sent. 5958 len. 20]: She well might-for here no foot of man might pass till she was a thing terrible to look at !
Parsing [sent. 5959 len. 17]: If there was nobody where seemed to be nothing , how fearfully empty was the universe !
Parsing [sent. 5960 len. 10]: Ah , if she had God for her friend !
Parsing [sent. 5961 len. 29]: What if he was her friend , and she had not known it because she never spoke to him , never asked him to do anything for her ?
Parsing [sent. 5962 len. 20]: It was horrible to think it could be a mere chance whether she got home , or died there !
Parsing [sent. 5963 len. 6]: She would pray to God !
Parsing [sent. 5964 len. 9]: She would ask him to take her home !
Parsing [sent. 5965 len. 8]: A wintery blast came from the north .
Parsing [sent. 5966 len. 14]: The black cloud had risen , and was now spreading over the zenith .
Parsing [sent. 5967 len. 11]: Again the wind came with an angry burst and snarl .
Parsing [sent. 5968 len. 11]: Snow carne swept upon it in hard sharp little pellets .
Parsing [sent. 5969 len. 9]: She started up , and forgot to pray .
Parsing [sent. 5970 len. 26]: Some sound in the wind or some hidden motion of memory all at once let loose upon her another fear , which straight was agony .
Parsing [sent. 5971 len. 27]: A rumour had reached the New House the night before , that a leopard had broken from a caravan , and got away to the hills .
Parsing [sent. 5972 len. 29]: It was but a rumour ; some did not believe it , and the owners contradicted it , but a party had set out with guns and dogs .
Parsing [sent. 5973 len. 4]: It was true !
Parsing [sent. 5974 len. 4]: it was true !
Parsing [sent. 5975 len. 10]: There was the terrible creature crouching behind that stone !
Parsing [sent. 5976 len. 21]: He was in every clump of heather she passed , swinging his tail , and ready to spring upon her !
Parsing [sent. 5977 len. 20]: He must be hungry by this time , and there was nothing there for him to eat but her !
Parsing [sent. 5978 len. 39]: By and by , however , she was too cold to be afraid , too cold to think , and presently , half-frozen and faint for lack of food , was scarce able to go a step farther .
Parsing [sent. 5979 len. 21]: She saw a great rock , sank down in the shelter of it , and in a minute was asleep .
Parsing [sent. 5980 len. 12]: She slept for some time , and woke a little refreshed .
Parsing [sent. 5981 len. 9]: The wonder is that she woke at all .
Parsing [sent. 5982 len. 12]: It was dark , and her first consciousness was ghastly fear .
Parsing [sent. 5983 len. 11]: The wind had ceased , and the storm was over .
Parsing [sent. 5984 len. 5]: Little snow had fallen .
Parsing [sent. 5985 len. 20]: The stars were all out overhead , and the great night was round her , enclosing , watching her .
Parsing [sent. 5986 len. 12]: She tried to rise , and could just move her limbs .
Parsing [sent. 5987 len. 15]: Had she fallen asleep again , she would not have lived through the night .
Parsing [sent. 5988 len. 20]: But it is idle to talk of what would have been ; nothing could have been but what was .
Parsing [sent. 5989 len. 11]: Mercy wondered afterwards that she did not lose her reason .
Parsing [sent. 5990 len. 13]: She must , she thought , have been trusting somehow in God .
Parsing [sent. 5991 len. 5]: It was terribly dreary .
Parsing [sent. 5992 len. 9]: Sure never one sorer needed God 's help !
Parsing [sent. 5993 len. 18]: And what better reason could there be for helping her than that she so sorely needed it !
Parsing [sent. 5994 len. 20]: Perhaps God had let her walk into this trouble that she might learn she could not do without him !
Parsing [sent. 5995 len. 8]: She -- would try to be good !
Parsing [sent. 5996 len. 15]: How terrible was the world , with such wide spaces and nobody in them !
Parsing [sent. 5997 len. 18]: And all the time , though she did not know it , she was sobbing and weeping .
Parsing [sent. 5998 len. 13]: The black silence was torn asunder by the report of a gun .
Parsing [sent. 5999 len. 21]: She started up with a strange mingling of hope and terror , gave a loud cry , and sank senseless .
Parsing [sent. 6000 len. 7]: The leopard would be upon her !
Parsing [sent. 6001 len. 6]: Her cry was her deliverance .
Parsing [sent. 6002 len. 3]: CHAPTER XVII .
Parsing [sent. 6003 len. 4]: IN THE TOMB .
Parsing [sent. 6004 len. 56]: The brothers had that same morning paid their visit to the tomb , and there spent the day after their usual fashion , intending to go home the same night , and as the old moon was very late in rising , to take the earlier and rougher part of the way in the twilight .
Parsing [sent. 6005 len. 25]: Just as they were setting out , however , what they rightly judged a passing storm came on , and they delayed their departure .
Parsing [sent. 6006 len. 39]: By the time the storm was over , it was dark , and there was no use in hurrying ; they might as well stop a while , and have the moon the latter part of the way .
Parsing [sent. 6007 len. 50]: When at length they were again on the point of starting , they thought they heard something like sounds of distress , but the darkness making search difficult and unsatisfactory , the chief thought of firing his gun , when Mercy 's cry guided them to where she lay .
Parsing [sent. 6008 len. 25]: Alister 's heart , at sight of her , and at the thought of what she must have gone through , nearly stood still .
Parsing [sent. 6009 len. 28]: They carried her in , laid her on the bed , and did what they could to restore her , till she began to come to herself .
Parsing [sent. 6010 len. 33]: Then they left her , that she might not see them without preparation , and sat down by the fire in the outer room , leaving the door open between the two .
Parsing [sent. 6011 len. 8]: `` I see how it is ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6012 len. 3]: said Alister .
Parsing [sent. 6013 len. 21]: `` You remember , Ian , what you said to her about giving Nature an opportunity of exerting her influence ?
Parsing [sent. 6014 len. 17]: Mercy has been following your advice , and has lost her way among the hills ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6015 len. 8]: `` That was so long ago ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6016 len. 4]: returned Ian thoughtfully .
Parsing [sent. 6017 len. 10]: `` Yes-when the weather was not fit for it .
Parsing [sent. 6018 len. 12]: It is not fit now , but she has ventured ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6019 len. 7]: `` I believe you are right !
Parsing [sent. 6020 len. 9]: I thought there was some reality in her !
Parsing [sent. 6021 len. 12]: - But she must not hear us talking about her ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6022 len. 41]: When Mercy came to herself , she thought at first that she lay where she had fallen , but presently perceived that she was covered , and had something hot at her feet : was she in her own bed ?
Parsing [sent. 6023 len. 24]: was it all a terrible dream , that she might know what it was to be lost , and think of God ? .
Parsing [sent. 6024 len. 13]: She put out her arm : her hand went against cold stone .
Parsing [sent. 6025 len. 26]: The dread thought rushed in-that she was buried-was lying in her grave-to lie there till the trumpet should sound , and the dead be raised .
Parsing [sent. 6026 len. 18]: She was not horrified ; her first feeling was gladness that she had prayed before she died .
Parsing [sent. 6027 len. 47]: She had been taught at church that an hour might come when it would be of no use to pray-the hour of an unbelieving death : it was of no use to pray now , but her prayer before she died might be of some avail !
Parsing [sent. 6028 len. 43]: She wondered that she was not more frightened , for in sooth it was a dreary prospect before her : long and countless years must pass ere again she heard the sound of voices , again saw the light of the sun !
Parsing [sent. 6029 len. 40]: She was half awake and half dreaming ; the faintness of her swoon yet upon her , the repose following her great weariness , and the lightness of her brain from want of food , made her indifferent-almost happy .
Parsing [sent. 6030 len. 11]: She could lie so a long time , she thought .
Parsing [sent. 6031 len. 15]: At length she began to hear sounds , and they were of human voices .
Parsing [sent. 6032 len. 8]: She had companions then in the grave !
Parsing [sent. 6033 len. 11]: she was not doomed to a solitary waiting for judgment !
Parsing [sent. 6034 len. 10]: She must be in some family-vault , among strangers .
Parsing [sent. 6035 len. 18]: She hoped they were nice people : it was very desirable to be buried with nice people !
Parsing [sent. 6036 len. 7]: Then she saw a reddish light .
Parsing [sent. 6037 len. 8]: It was a fire -- far off !
Parsing [sent. 6038 len. 7]: Was she in the bad place ?
Parsing [sent. 6039 len. 15]: Were those shapes two demons , waiting till she had got over her dying ?
Parsing [sent. 6040 len. 16]: She listened : -- `` That will divide her between us , '' said one .
Parsing [sent. 6041 len. 18]: `` Yes , '' answered the other ; `` there will be no occasion to cut it !
Parsing [sent. 6042 len. 8]: `` What dreadful thing could they mean ?
Parsing [sent. 6043 len. 9]: But surely she had heard their voices before !
Parsing [sent. 6044 len. 9]: She tried to speak , but could not .
Parsing [sent. 6045 len. 8]: `` We must come again soon ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6046 len. 3]: said one .
Parsing [sent. 6047 len. 15]: `` At this rate it will take a life-time to carve the tomb . ''
Parsing [sent. 6048 len. 12]: `` If we were but at the roof of it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6049 len. 4]: said the other .
Parsing [sent. 6050 len. 23]: `` I long to tackle the great serpent of eternity , and lay him twining and coiling and undulating all over it !
Parsing [sent. 6051 len. 34]: I dream about those tombs before ever they were broken into-royally furnished in the dark , waiting for the souls to come back to their old , brown , dried up bodies ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6052 len. 25]: Here one of them rose and came toward her , growing bigger and blacker as he came , until he stood by the bedside .
Parsing [sent. 6053 len. 13]: He laid his hand on her wrist , and felt her pulse .
Parsing [sent. 6054 len. 4]: It was Ian !
Parsing [sent. 6055 len. 23]: She could not see his face for there was no light on it , but she knew his shape , his movements !
Parsing [sent. 6056 len. 4]: She was saved !
Parsing [sent. 6057 len. 16]: He saw her wide eyes , two great spiritual nights , gazing up at him .
Parsing [sent. 6058 len. 11]: `` All , you are better , Miss Mercy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6059 len. 4]: lie said cheerily .
Parsing [sent. 6060 len. 9]: `` Now you shall have some tea ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6061 len. 16]: Something inside her was weeping for joy , but her outer self was quite still .
Parsing [sent. 6062 len. 13]: She tried again to speak , and uttered a few inarticulate sounds .
Parsing [sent. 6063 len. 19]: Then came Alister on tip-toe , and they stood both by the bedside , looking down on her .
Parsing [sent. 6064 len. 10]: `` I shall be all right presently ! '' '
Parsing [sent. 6065 len. 7]: she managed at length to say .
Parsing [sent. 6066 len. 10]: `` I am so glad I 'm not dead !
Parsing [sent. 6067 len. 7]: I thought I was dead ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6068 len. 14]: `` You would soon have been if we had not found you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6069 len. 3]: replied Alister .
Parsing [sent. 6070 len. 10]: `` Was it you that fired the gun ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6071 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 6072 len. 7]: `` I was so frightened ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6073 len. 9]: `` It saved your life , thank God !
Parsing [sent. 6074 len. 7]: for then you cried out . ''
Parsing [sent. 6075 len. 10]: `` Fright was your door out of fear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6076 len. 3]: said Ian .
Parsing [sent. 6077 len. 9]: `` I thought it was the leopard ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6078 len. 15]: `` I did bring my gun because of the leopard , '' said Alister .
Parsing [sent. 6079 len. 9]: `` It was true about him then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6080 len. 6]: `` He is out . ''
Parsing [sent. 6081 len. 9]: `` And now it is quite dark ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6082 len. 25]: `` It does n't signify ; we 'll take a lantern ; I 've got my gun , and Ian has his dirk ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6083 len. 8]: `` Where are you going then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6084 len. 6]: asked Mercy , still confused .
Parsing [sent. 6085 len. 7]: `` Home , of course . ''
Parsing [sent. 6086 len. 8]: `` Oh , yes , of course !
Parsing [sent. 6087 len. 9]: I will get up in a minute . ''
Parsing [sent. 6088 len. 11]: `` There is plenty of time , '' said Ian .
Parsing [sent. 6089 len. 10]: `` You must eat something before you get up .
Parsing [sent. 6090 len. 14]: We , have nothing but oat-cakes , I am sorry to say ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6091 len. 10]: `` I think you promised me some tea ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6092 len. 3]: said Mercy .
Parsing [sent. 6093 len. 8]: `` I do n't feel hungry . ''
Parsing [sent. 6094 len. 7]: `` You shall have the tea .
Parsing [sent. 6095 len. 7]: When did you eat last ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6096 len. 6]: `` Not since breakfast . ''
Parsing [sent. 6097 len. 11]: `` It is a marvel you are able to speak !
Parsing [sent. 6098 len. 9]: You must try to eat some oat-cake . ''
Parsing [sent. 6099 len. 14]: `` I wish I had n't taken that last slice of deer-ham ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6100 len. 5]: said Alister , ruefully .
Parsing [sent. 6101 len. 12]: `` I will eat if I can , '' said Mercy .
Parsing [sent. 6102 len. 30]: They brought her a cup of tea and some pieces of oat-cake ; then , having lighted her a candle , they left her , and closed the door .
Parsing [sent. 6103 len. 25]: She sipped her tea , managed to eat a little of the dry but wholesome food , and found herself capable of getting up .
Parsing [sent. 6104 len. 6]: It was the strangest bedroom !
Parsing [sent. 6105 len. 3]: she thought .
Parsing [sent. 6106 len. 9]: Everything was cut out of the live rock .
Parsing [sent. 6107 len. 8]: The dressing-table might have been a sarcophagus !
Parsing [sent. 6108 len. 12]: She kneeled by the bedside , and tried to thank God .
Parsing [sent. 6109 len. 6]: Then she opened the door .
Parsing [sent. 6110 len. 9]: The chief rose at the sound of it .
Parsing [sent. 6111 len. 21]: `` I 'm sorry , '' he said , `` that we have no woman to wait on you . ''
Parsing [sent. 6112 len. 9]: `` I want nothing , thank you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6113 len. 16]: answered Mercy , feeling very weak and ready to cry , but restraining her tears .
Parsing [sent. 6114 len. 9]: `` What a curious house this is ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6115 len. 23]: `` It is a sort of doll 's house my brother and I have been at work upon for nearly fifteen years .
Parsing [sent. 6116 len. 22]: We meant , when summer was come , to ask you all to spend a day with us up here . ''
Parsing [sent. 6117 len. 45]: `` Whhen first we went to work on it , '' said Ian , `` we used to tell each other tales in which it bore a large share , and Alister 's were generally about a lost princess taking refuge in it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6118 len. 9]: `` And now it is come true ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6119 len. 3]: said Alister .
Parsing [sent. 6120 len. 9]: `` What an escape I have had ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6121 len. 12]: `` I do not like to hear you say that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6122 len. 3]: returned Ian .
Parsing [sent. 6123 len. 11]: `` You have been taken care of all the time .
Parsing [sent. 6124 len. 27]: If you had died in the cold , it would not have been because God had forgotten you ; you would not have been lost . ''
Parsing [sent. 6125 len. 18]: `` I wanted to know , '' said Mercy , `` whether Nature would speak to me .
Parsing [sent. 6126 len. 6]: It was of no use !
Parsing [sent. 6127 len. 7]: She never came near me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6128 len. 16]: `` I think she must have come without your knowing her , '' answered Ian .
Parsing [sent. 6129 len. 25]: `` But we shall have a talk about that afterwards , when you are quite rested ; we must prepare for home now . ''
Parsing [sent. 6130 len. 14]: Mercy 's heart sank within her -- she felt so weak and sleepy !
Parsing [sent. 6131 len. 12]: How was she to go back over all that rough mountain-way !
Parsing [sent. 6132 len. 12]: But she dared not ask to be left-with the leopard about !
Parsing [sent. 6133 len. 8]: He might come down the wide chimney !
Parsing [sent. 6134 len. 13]: She soon found that the brothers had never thought of her walking .
Parsing [sent. 6135 len. 8]: They wrapt her in Ian 's plaid .
Parsing [sent. 6136 len. 62]: Then they took the chiefs , which was very strong , and having folded it twice lengthwise , drew each an end of it over his shoulders , letting it hang in a loop between them : in this loop they made her seat herself , and putting each as arm behind her , tried how they could all get on .
Parsing [sent. 6137 len. 15]: After a few shiftings and accommodations , they found the plan likely to answer .
Parsing [sent. 6138 len. 16]: So they locked the door , and left the fire glowing on the solitary hearth .
Parsing [sent. 6139 len. 15]: To Mercy it was the strangest journey -- an experience never to be forgotten .
Parsing [sent. 6140 len. 12]: The tea had warmed her , and the air revived her .
Parsing [sent. 6141 len. 18]: It was not very cold , for only now and then blew a little puff of wind .
Parsing [sent. 6142 len. 26]: The stars were brilliant overhead , and the wide void of the air between her and the earth below seemed full of wonder and mystery .
Parsing [sent. 6143 len. 25]: Now and then she fancied some distant sound the cry of the leopard : he might be coming nearer and nearer as they went !
Parsing [sent. 6144 len. 37]: but it rather added to the eerie witchery of the night , making it like a terrible story read in the deserted nursery , with the distant noise outside of her brothers and sisters at play .
Parsing [sent. 6145 len. 13]: The motion of her progress by and by became pleasant to her .
Parsing [sent. 6146 len. 28]: Sometimes her feet would brush the tops of the heather ; but when they came to rocky ground , they always shortened the loop of the plaid .
Parsing [sent. 6147 len. 49]: To Mercy 's inner ear came the sound of words she had heard at church : `` He shall give his angels charge over thee , and in their hands they shall bear thee up , lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone . ''
Parsing [sent. 6148 len. 10]: Were not these two men God 's own angels !
Parsing [sent. 6149 len. 26]: They scarcely spoke , except when they stopped to take breath , but went on and on with a steady , rhythmic , silent trudge .
Parsing [sent. 6150 len. 24]: Up and down the rough hill , and upon the hardly less rough hill-road , they had enough ado to heed their steps .
Parsing [sent. 6151 len. 16]: Now and then they would let her walk a little way , but not far .
Parsing [sent. 6152 len. 16]: She was neither so strong nor so heavy as a fat deer , they said .
Parsing [sent. 6153 len. 35]: They were yet high among the hills , when the pale , withered , waste shred of the old moon rose above the upheaved boat-like back of one of the battlements of the horizon-rampart .
Parsing [sent. 6154 len. 44]: With disconsolate face , now lost , now found again , always reappearing where Mercy had not been looking for her , she accompanied them the rest of their journey , and the witch-like creature brought out the whole character of the night .
Parsing [sent. 6155 len. 23]: Booked in her wonderful swing , Mercy was not always quite sure that she was not dreaming the strangest , pleasantest dream .
Parsing [sent. 6156 len. 66]: Were they not fittest for a dream , this star and moon beset night-this wind that now and then blew so eerie and wild , yet did not wake her-this gulf around , above , and beneath her , through which she was borne as if she had indeed died , and angels were carrying her through wastes of air to some unknown region afar ?
Parsing [sent. 6157 len. 16]: Except when she brushed the heather , she forgot that the earth was near her .
Parsing [sent. 6158 len. 29]: The arms around her were the arms of men and not angels , but how far above this lower world dwelt the souls that moved those strong limbs !
Parsing [sent. 6159 len. 9]: What a small creature she was beside them !
Parsing [sent. 6160 len. 9]: how unworthy of the labour of their deliverance !
Parsing [sent. 6161 len. 28]: Her awe of the one kept growing ; the other she could trust with heart as well as brain ; she could never be afraid of him !
Parsing [sent. 6162 len. 11]: To the chief she turned to shadow her from Ian .
Parsing [sent. 6163 len. 33]: When they came to the foot of the path leading up to Mistress Conal 's cottage , there , although it was dark night , sat the old woman on a stone .
Parsing [sent. 6164 len. 15]: `` It 's a sorrow you are carrying home with you , chief ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6165 len. 5]: she said in Gaelic .
Parsing [sent. 6166 len. 10]: `` As well have saved a drowning man ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6167 len. 16]: She did not rise or move , but spoke like one talking by the fireside .
Parsing [sent. 6168 len. 12]: `` The drowning man has to be saved , mother ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6169 len. 22]: answered the chief , also in Gaelic ; `` and the sorrow in your way has to be taken with you .
Parsing [sent. 6170 len. 8]: It wo n't let you pass ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6171 len. 7]: `` True , my son ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6172 len. 16]: said the woman ; `` but it makes the heart sore that sees it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6173 len. 15]: - `` Thank you for the warning then , but welcome the sorrow ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6174 len. 3]: he returned .
Parsing [sent. 6175 len. 5]: `` Good night . ''
Parsing [sent. 6176 len. 9]: `` Good night , chiefs sons both ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6177 len. 3]: she replied .
Parsing [sent. 6178 len. 8]: `` You 're your father 's anyway !
Parsing [sent. 6179 len. 21]: Did he not one night bring home a frozen fox in his arms , to warm him by his fire !
Parsing [sent. 6180 len. 11]: But when he had warmed him-lie turned him out ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6181 len. 25]: It was quite clear when last they looked at the sky , but the moment they left her , it began to rain heavily .
Parsing [sent. 6182 len. 68]: So fast did it rain , that the men , fearing for Mercy , turned off the road , and went down a steep descent , to make straight across their own fields for the cottage ; and just as they reached the bottom of the descent , although they had come all the rough way hitherto without slipping or stumbling -- once , the chief fell .
Parsing [sent. 6183 len. 37]: He rose in consternation ; but finding that Mercy , upheld by Ian , had simply dropped on her feet , and taken no hurt , relieved himself by un - sparing abuse of his clumsiness .
Parsing [sent. 6184 len. 16]: Mercy laughed merrily , resumed her place in the plaid , and closed her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 6185 len. 29]: She never saw where they were going , for she opened them again only when they stopped a little as they turned into the fir-clump before the door .
Parsing [sent. 6186 len. 6]: `` Where are we ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6187 len. 14]: she asked ; but for answer they carried her straight into the house .
Parsing [sent. 6188 len. 16]: `` We have brought you to our mother instead of yours , '' said Alister .
Parsing [sent. 6189 len. 18]: `` To get wet would have been the last straw on the back of such a day .
Parsing [sent. 6190 len. 13]: We will let them know at once that you are safe . ''
Parsing [sent. 6191 len. 35]: Lady Macruadh , as the highlanders generally called her , made haste to receive the poor girl with that sympathetic pity which , of all good plants , flourishes most in the Celtic heart .
Parsing [sent. 6192 len. 33]: Mercy 's mother had come to her in consternation at her absence , and the only comfort she could give her was the suggestion that she had fallen in with her sons .
Parsing [sent. 6193 len. 24]: She gave her a warm bath,-put her to bed , and then made her eat , so preparing her for a healthful sleep .
Parsing [sent. 6194 len. 14]: And she did sleep , but dreamed of darkness and snow and leopards .
Parsing [sent. 6195 len. 34]: As men were out searching in all directions , Alister , while Ian went to the New House , lighted a beacon on the top of the old castle to bring them back .
Parsing [sent. 6196 len. 25]: By the time Ian had persuaded Mrs. Palmer to leave Mercy in his mother 's care for the night , it was blazing beautifully .
Parsing [sent. 6197 len. 19]: In the morning it was found that Mercy had a bad cold , and could not be moved .
Parsing [sent. 6198 len. 26]: But the cottage , small as it was , had more than one guest-chamber , and Mrs. Macruadh was delighted to have her to nurse .

Parsing [sent. 6224 len. 14]: THE FAREWELL WHAT 'S MINE 'S MINE CHAPTER I AT A HIGH SCHOOL .
Parsing [sent. 6225 len. 46]: When Mercy was able to go down to the drawing-room , she found the evenings pass as never evenings passed before ; and during the day , although her mother and Christina came often to see her , she had time and quiet for thinking .
Parsing [sent. 6226 len. 40]: And think she must ; for she found herself in a region of human life so different from any she had hitherto entered , that in no other circumstances would she have been able to recognize even its existence .
Parsing [sent. 6227 len. 12]: Everything said or done in it seemed to acknowledge something understood .
Parsing [sent. 6228 len. 37]: Life went on with a continuous lean toward something rarely mentioned , plainly uppermost ; it embodied a tacit reference of everything to some code so thoroughly recognized that occasion for alluding to it was unfrequent .
Parsing [sent. 6229 len. 14]: Its inhabitants appeared to know things which her people did not even suspect .
Parsing [sent. 6230 len. 31]: The air of the brothers especially was that of men at their ease yet ready to rise -- of men whose loins were girded , alert for an expected call .
Parsing [sent. 6231 len. 30]: Under their influence a new idea of life , and the world , and the relations of men and things , began to grow in the mind of Mercy .
Parsing [sent. 6232 len. 28]: There was a dignity , almost grandeur , about the simple life of the cottage , and the relation of its inmates to all they came near .
Parsing [sent. 6233 len. 25]: No one of them seemed to live for self , but each to be thinking and caring for the others and for the clan .
Parsing [sent. 6234 len. 100]: She awoke to see that manners are of the soul ; that such as she had hitherto heard admired were not to be compared with the simple , almost peasant-like dignity and courtesy of the chief ; that the natural grace , accustomed ease , and cultivated refinement of Ian 's carriage , came out in attention and service to the lowly even more than in converse with his equals ; while his words , his gestures , his looks , every expression born of contact , witnessed a directness and delicacy of recognition she could never have imagined .
Parsing [sent. 6235 len. 48]: The moment he began to speak to another , he seemed to pass out of himself , and sit in the ears of the other to watch his own words , lest his thoughts should take such sound or shape as might render them unwelcome or weak .
Parsing [sent. 6236 len. 46]: If they were not to be pleasant words , they should yet be no more unpleasant than was needful ; they should not hurt save in the nature of that which they bore ; the truth should receive no injury by admixture of his personality .
Parsing [sent. 6237 len. 20]: He heard with his own soul , and was careful over the other soul as one of like kind .
Parsing [sent. 6238 len. 35]: So delicately would he initiate what might be communion with another , that to a nature too dull or selfish to understand him , he gave offence by the very graciousness of his approach .
Parsing [sent. 6239 len. 41]: It was through her growing love to Alister that Mercy became able to understand Ian , and perceived at length that her dread , almost dislike of him at first , was owing solely to her mingled incapacity and unworthiness .
Parsing [sent. 6240 len. 26]: Before she left the cottage , it was spring time in her soul ; it had begun to put forth the buds of eternal life .
Parsing [sent. 6241 len. 54]: Such buds are not unfrequently nipped ; but even if they are , if a dull , false , commonplace frost close in , and numb the half wakened spirit back into its wintry sleep , that sleep will ever after be haunted with some fainting airs of the paradise those buds prophesied .
Parsing [sent. 6242 len. 70]: In Mercy 's case they were to grow into spiritual eyes -- to open and see , through all the fogs and tumults of this phantom world , the light and reality of the true , the spiritual world everywhere around her -- as the opened eyes of the servant of the prophet saw the mountains of Samaria full of horses of fire and chariots of fire around him .
Parsing [sent. 6243 len. 33]: Every throb of true love , however mingled with the foolish and the false , is a bourgeoning of the buds of the life eternal -- ah , how far from leaves !
Parsing [sent. 6244 len. 6]: how much farther from flowers .
Parsing [sent. 6245 len. 24]: Ian was high above her , so high that she shrank from him ; there seemed a whole heaven of height between them .
Parsing [sent. 6246 len. 28]: It would fill her with a kind of despair to see him at times sit lost in thought : he was where she could never follow him !
Parsing [sent. 6247 len. 37]: He was in a world which , to her childish thought , seemed not the world of humanity ; and she would turn , with a sense of both seeking and finding , to the chief .
Parsing [sent. 6248 len. 21]: She imagined he felt as she did , saw between his brother and him a gulf he could not cross .
Parsing [sent. 6249 len. 17]: She did not perceive this difference , that Alister knew the gulf had to be crossed .
Parsing [sent. 6250 len. 32]: At such a time , too , she had seen his mother regarding him with a similar expression of loss , but with a mingling of anxiety that was hers only .
Parsing [sent. 6251 len. 41]: It was sweet to Mercy to see in the eyes of Alister , and in his whole bearing toward his younger brother , that he was a learner like herself , that they were scholars together in Ian 's school .
Parsing [sent. 6252 len. 19]: A hunger after something beyond her , a something she could not have described , awoke in her .
Parsing [sent. 6253 len. 14]: She needed a salvation of some kind , toward which she must grow !
Parsing [sent. 6254 len. 53]: She needed a change which she could not understand until it came -- a change the greatest in the universe , but which , man being created with the absolute necessity for it , can be no violent transformation , can be only a grand process in the divine idea of development .
Parsing [sent. 6255 len. 24]: She began to feel a mystery in the world , and in all the looks of it -- a mystery because a meaning .
Parsing [sent. 6256 len. 77]: She saw a jubilance in every sunrise , a sober sadness in every sunset ; heard a whispering of strange secrets in the wind of the twilight ; perceived a consciousness of unknown bliss in the song of the lark ; -- and was aware of a something beyond it all , now and then filling her with wonder , and compelling her to ask , `` What does it , what can it mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6257 len. 44]: Not once did she suspect that Nature had indeed begun to deal with her ; not once suspect , although from childhood accustomed to hear the name of Love taken in vain , that love had anything to do with these inexplicable experiences .
Parsing [sent. 6258 len. 19]: Let no one , however , imagine he explains such experiences by suggesting that she was in love !
Parsing [sent. 6259 len. 13]: That were but to mention another mystery as having introduced the former .
Parsing [sent. 6260 len. 18]: For who in heaven or on earth has fathomed the marvel betwixt the man and the woman ?
Parsing [sent. 6261 len. 18]: Least of all the man or the woman who has not learned to regard it with reverence .
Parsing [sent. 6262 len. 34]: There is more in this love to uplift us , more to condemn the lie in us , than in any other inborn drift of our being , except the heavenly tide Godward .
Parsing [sent. 6263 len. 11]: From it flow all the other redeeming relations of life .
Parsing [sent. 6264 len. 26]: It is the hold God has of us with his right hand , while death is the hold he has of us with his left .
Parsing [sent. 6265 len. 21]: Love and death are the two marvels , yea the two terrors -- but the one goal of our history .
Parsing [sent. 6266 len. 20]: It was love , in part , that now awoke in Mercy a hunger and thirst after heavenly things .
Parsing [sent. 6267 len. 22]: This is a direction of its power little heeded by its historians ; its earthly side occupies almost all their care .
Parsing [sent. 6268 len. 32]: Because lovers are not worthy of even its earthly aspect , it palls upon them , and they grow weary , not of love , but of their lack of it .
Parsing [sent. 6269 len. 18]: The want of the heavenly in it has caused it to perish : it had no salt .
Parsing [sent. 6270 len. 13]: From those that have not is taken away that which they have .
Parsing [sent. 6271 len. 8]: Love without religion is the plucked rose .
Parsing [sent. 6272 len. 10]: Religion without love -- there is no such thing .
Parsing [sent. 6273 len. 35]: Religion is the bush that bears all the roses ; for religion is the natural condition of man in relation to the eternal facts , that is the truths , of his own being .
Parsing [sent. 6274 len. 13]: To live is to love ; there is no life but love .
Parsing [sent. 6275 len. 17]: What shape the love puts on , depends on the persons between whom is the relation .
Parsing [sent. 6276 len. 46]: The poorest love with religion , is better , because truer , therefore more lasting , more genuine , more endowed with the possibility of persistence -- that is , of infinite development , than the most passionate devotion between man and woman without it .
Parsing [sent. 6277 len. 24]: Thus together in their relation to Ian , it was natural that Mercy and the chief should draw yet more to each other .
Parsing [sent. 6278 len. 20]: Mercy regarded Alister as a big brother in the same class with herself , but able to help her .
Parsing [sent. 6279 len. 5]: Quickly they grew intimate .
Parsing [sent. 6280 len. 47]: In the simplicity of his large nature , the chief talked with Mercy as openly as a boy , laying a heart bare to her such that , if the world had many like it , the kingdom of heaven would be more than at hand .
Parsing [sent. 6281 len. 24]: He talked as to an old friend in perfect understanding with him , from whom he had nothing to gain or to fear .
Parsing [sent. 6282 len. 44]: There was never a compliment on the part of the man , and never a coquetry on the part of the girl -- a dull idea to such as without compliment or coquetry could hold no intercourse , having no other available means .
Parsing [sent. 6283 len. 31]: Mercy had never like her sister cultivated the woman 's part in the low game ; and her truth required but the slightest stimulus to make her incapable of it .
Parsing [sent. 6284 len. 29]: With such a man as Alister she could use only a simplicity like his ; not thus to meet him would have been to decline the honouring friendship .
Parsing [sent. 6285 len. 51]: Dark and plain , though with an interesting face and fine eyes , she had received no such compliments as had been showered upon her sister ; it was an unspoiled girl , with a heart alive though not yet quite awake , that was brought under such good influences .
Parsing [sent. 6286 len. 16]: What better influences for her , for any woman , than those of unselfish men ?
Parsing [sent. 6287 len. 13]: what influences so good for any man as those of unselfish women ?
Parsing [sent. 6288 len. 46]: Every man that hears and learns of a worthy neighbour , comes to the Father ; every man that hath heard and learned of the Father comes to the Lord ; every man that comes to the Lord , he leads back to the Father .
Parsing [sent. 6289 len. 20]: To hear Ian speak one word about Jesus Christ , was for a true man to be thenceforth truer .
Parsing [sent. 6290 len. 43]: To him the Lord was not a theological personage , but a man present in the world , who had to be understood and obeyed by the will and heart and soul , by the imagination and conscience of every other man .
Parsing [sent. 6291 len. 22]: If what Ian said was true , this life was a serious affair , and to be lived in downright earnest !
Parsing [sent. 6292 len. 15]: If God would have his creatures mind him , she must look to it !
Parsing [sent. 6293 len. 6]: She pondered what she heard .
Parsing [sent. 6294 len. 24]: But she went always to Alister to have Ian explained ; and to hear him talk of Ian , revealed Alister to her .
Parsing [sent. 6295 len. 19]: When Mercy left the cottage , she felt as if she were leaving home to pay a visit .
Parsing [sent. 6296 len. 8]: The rich house was dull and uninteresting .
Parsing [sent. 6297 len. 35]: She found that she had immediately to put in practice one of the lessons she had learned -- that the service of God is the service of those among whom he has sent us .
Parsing [sent. 6298 len. 16]: She tried therefore to be cheerful , and even to forestall her mother 's wishes .
Parsing [sent. 6299 len. 15]: But life was harder than hitherto -- so much more was required of her .
Parsing [sent. 6300 len. 20]: The chief was falling thoroughly in love with Mercy , but it was some time before he knew it .
Parsing [sent. 6301 len. 29]: With a heart full of tenderness toward everything human , he knew little of love special , and was gradually sliding into it without being aware of it .
Parsing [sent. 6302 len. 7]: How little are we our own !
Parsing [sent. 6303 len. 12]: Existence is decreed us ; love and suffering are appointed us .
Parsing [sent. 6304 len. 22]: We may resist , we may modify ; but we can not help loving , and we can not help dying .
Parsing [sent. 6305 len. 9]: We need God to keep us from hating .
Parsing [sent. 6306 len. 30]: Great in goodness , yea absolutely good , God must be , to have a right to make us -- to compel our existence , and decree its laws !
Parsing [sent. 6307 len. 10]: Without his choice the chief was falling in love .
Parsing [sent. 6308 len. 14]: The woman was sent him ; his heart opened and took her in .
Parsing [sent. 6309 len. 13]: Relation with her family was not desirable , but there she was !
Parsing [sent. 6310 len. 7]: Ian saw , but said nothing .
Parsing [sent. 6311 len. 6]: His mother saw it too .
Parsing [sent. 6312 len. 9]: `` Nothing good will come of it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6313 len. 13]: she said , with a strong feeling of unfitness in the thing .
Parsing [sent. 6314 len. 21]: `` Everything will come of it , mother , that God would have come of it , '' answered Ian .
Parsing [sent. 6315 len. 24]: `` She is an honest , good girl , and whatever comes of it must be good , whether pleasant or not . ''
Parsing [sent. 6316 len. 5]: The mother was silent .
Parsing [sent. 6317 len. 22]: She believed in God , but not so thoroughly as to abjure the exercise of a subsidiary providence of her own .
Parsing [sent. 6318 len. 24]: The more people trust in God , the less will they trust their own judgments , or interfere with the ordering of events .
Parsing [sent. 6319 len. 25]: The man or woman who opposes the heart 's desire of another , except in aid of righteousness , is a servant of Satan .
Parsing [sent. 6320 len. 17]: Nor will it avail anything to call that righteousness which is of Self or of Mammon .
Parsing [sent. 6321 len. 23]: `` There is no action in fretting , '' Ian would say , `` and not much in the pondering of consequences .
Parsing [sent. 6322 len. 19]: True action is the doing of duty , come of it heartache , defeat , or success . ''
Parsing [sent. 6323 len. 9]: `` You are a fatalist , Ian ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6324 len. 6]: said his mother one day .
Parsing [sent. 6325 len. 15]: `` Mother , I am ; the will of God is my fate ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6326 len. 3]: answered Ian .
Parsing [sent. 6327 len. 17]: `` He shall do with me what he pleases ; and I will help him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6328 len. 10]: She took him in her arms and kissed him .
Parsing [sent. 6329 len. 24]: She hoped God would not he strict with him , for might not the very grandeur of his character be rooted in rebellion ?
Parsing [sent. 6330 len. 9]: Might not some figs grow on some thistles ?
Parsing [sent. 6331 len. 14]: At length came the paternal summons for the Palmers to go to London .
Parsing [sent. 6332 len. 13]: For a month the families had been meeting all but every day .
Parsing [sent. 6333 len. 41]: The chief had begun to look deep into the eyes of the girl , as if searching there for some secret joy ; and the girl , though she drooped her long lashes , did not turn her head away .
Parsing [sent. 6334 len. 44]: And now separation , like death , gave her courage , and when they parted , Mercy not only sustained Alister 's look , but gave him such a look in return that he felt no need , no impulse to say anything .
Parsing [sent. 6335 len. 14]: Their souls were satisfied , for they knew they belonged to each other .
Parsing [sent. 6336 len. 6]: CHAPTER II A TERRIBLE DISCOVERY .
Parsing [sent. 6337 len. 29]: So entirely were the chief and his family out of the world , that they had not yet a notion of the worldly relations of Mr. Peregrine Palmer .
Parsing [sent. 6338 len. 17]: But the mother thought it high time to make inquiry as to his position and connections .
Parsing [sent. 6339 len. 38]: She had an old friend in London , the wife of a certain vice-chancellor , with whom she held an occasional correspondence , and to her she wrote , asking if she knew anything of the family .
Parsing [sent. 6340 len. 17]: Mrs. Macruadh was nowise free from the worldliness that has regard to the world 's regard .
Parsing [sent. 6341 len. 34]: She would not have been satisfied that a daughter in law of hers should come of people distinguished for goodness and greatness of soul , if they were , for instance , tradespeople .
Parsing [sent. 6342 len. 47]: She would doubtless have preferred the daughter of an honest man , whatever his position , to the daughter of a scoundrel , even if he chanced to be a duke ; but she would not have been content with the most distinguished goodness by itself .
Parsing [sent. 6343 len. 63]: Walking after Jesus , she would have drawn to the side of Joanna rather than Martha or Mary ; and I fear she would have condescended -- just a little -- to Mary Magdalen : repentance , however perfect , is far from enough to satisfy the worldy squeamishness of not a few high-principled people who do not know what repentance means .
Parsing [sent. 6344 len. 20]: Mrs. Macruadh was anxious to know that the girl was respectable , and so far worthy of her son .
Parsing [sent. 6345 len. 22]: The idea of such an inquiry would have filled Mercy 's parents with scornful merriment , as a thing ludicrous indeed .
Parsing [sent. 6346 len. 79]: People in THEIR position , who could do this and that , whose name stood so high for this and that , who knew themselves well bred , who had one relation an admiral , another a general , and a marriage-connection with some of the oldest families in the country -- that one little better than a yeoman , a man who held the plough with his own big hands , should enquire into THEIR social standing !
Parsing [sent. 6347 len. 17]: Was not Mr. Peregrine Palmer prepared to buy him up the moment he required to sell !
Parsing [sent. 6348 len. 24]: Was he not rich enough to purchase an earl 's daughter for his son , and an earl himself for his beautiful Christina !
Parsing [sent. 6349 len. 8]: The thing would have seemed too preposterous .
Parsing [sent. 6350 len. 18]: The answer of the vice-chancellor 's lady burst , nevertheless , like a bombshell in the cottage .
Parsing [sent. 6351 len. 51]: It was to this effect : -- The Palmers were known , if not just in the best , yet in very good society ; the sons bore sign of a defective pedigree , but the one daughter out was , thanks to her mother , fit to go anywhere .
Parsing [sent. 6352 len. 66]: For her own part , wrote the London correspondent , she could not help smelling the grains : in Scotland a distiller , Mr. Peregrine Palmer had taken to brewing in England -- was one of the firm Pulp and Palmer , owning half the public-houses in London , therefore high in the regard of the English nobility , if not actually within their circle .
Parsing [sent. 6353 len. 10]: -- Thus far the satirical lady of the vice-chancellor .
Parsing [sent. 6354 len. 9]: Horror fell upon the soul of the mother .
Parsing [sent. 6355 len. 13]: The distiller was to her as the publican to the ancient Jew .
Parsing [sent. 6356 len. 34]: No dealing in rags and marine stores , no scraping of a fortune by pettifogging , chicane , and cheating , was to her half so abominable as the trade of a brewer .
Parsing [sent. 6357 len. 20]: Worse yet was a brewer owning public-houses , gathering riches in half-pence wet with beer and smelling of gin .
Parsing [sent. 6358 len. 15]: The brewer was to her a moral pariah ; only a distiller was worse .
Parsing [sent. 6359 len. 22]: As she read , the letter dropped from her hands , and she threw them up in unconscious appeal to heaven .
Parsing [sent. 6360 len. 30]: She saw a vision of bloated men and white-faced women , drawing with trembling hands from torn pockets the money that had bought the wide acres of the Clanruadh .
Parsing [sent. 6361 len. 13]: To think of the Macruadh marrying the daughter of such a man !
Parsing [sent. 6362 len. 52]: In society few questions indeed were asked ; everywhere money was counted a blessed thing , almost however made ; none the less the damnable fact remained , that certain moneys were made , not in furthering the well-being of men and women , but in furthering their sin and degradation .
Parsing [sent. 6363 len. 89]: The mother of the chief saw that , let the world wink itself to blindness , let it hide the roots of the money-plant in layer upon layer of social ascent , the flower for which an earl will give his daughter , has for the soil it grows in , not the dead , but the diseased and dying , of loathsome bodies and souls of God 's men and women and children , which the grower of it has helped to make such as they are .
Parsing [sent. 6364 len. 18]: She was hot , she was cold ; she started up and paced hurriedly about the room .
Parsing [sent. 6365 len. 10]: Her son the son in law of a distiller !
Parsing [sent. 6366 len. 6]: the husband of his daughter !
Parsing [sent. 6367 len. 8]: The idea was itself abhorrence and contempt !
Parsing [sent. 6368 len. 30]: Was he not one of the devil 's fishers , fishing the sea of the world for the souls of men and women to fill his infernal ponds withal !
Parsing [sent. 6369 len. 12]: His money was the fungous growth of the devil 's cellars .
Parsing [sent. 6370 len. 17]: How would the brewer or the distiller , she said , appear at the last judgment !
Parsing [sent. 6371 len. 18]: How would her son hold up his head , if he cast in his lot with theirs !
Parsing [sent. 6372 len. 7]: But that he would never do !
Parsing [sent. 6373 len. 7]: Why should she be so perturbed !
Parsing [sent. 6374 len. 13]: in this matter at least there could be no difference between them !
Parsing [sent. 6375 len. 14]: Her noble Alister would be as much shocked as herself at the news !
Parsing [sent. 6376 len. 13]: Could the woman be a lady , grown on such a hothed !
Parsing [sent. 6377 len. 4]: Yet , alas !
Parsing [sent. 6378 len. 10]: love could tempt far -- could subdue the impossible !
Parsing [sent. 6379 len. 12]: She could not rest ; she must find one of them !
Parsing [sent. 6380 len. 13]: Not a moment longer could she remain alone with the terrible disclosure .
Parsing [sent. 6381 len. 18]: If Alister was in love with the girl , he must get out of it at once !
Parsing [sent. 6382 len. 18]: Never again would she enter the Palmers ' gate , never again set foot on their land !
Parsing [sent. 6383 len. 7]: The thought of it was unthinkable !
Parsing [sent. 6384 len. 12]: She would meet them as if she did not see them !
Parsing [sent. 6385 len. 12]: But they should know her reason -- and know her inexorable !
Parsing [sent. 6386 len. 24]: She went to the edge of the ridge , and saw Ian sitting with his book on the other side of the burn .
Parsing [sent. 6387 len. 12]: She called him to her , and handed him the letter .
Parsing [sent. 6388 len. 14]: He took it , read it through , and gave it her back .
Parsing [sent. 6389 len. 4]: `` Ian ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6390 len. 13]: she exclaimed , `` have you nothing to say to that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6391 len. 19]: `` I beg your pardon , mother , '' he answered : `` I must think about it .
Parsing [sent. 6392 len. 7]: Why should it trouble you so !
Parsing [sent. 6393 len. 16]: It is painfully annoying , but we have come under no obligation to them ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6394 len. 7]: `` No ; but Alister ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6395 len. 13]: `` You can not doubt Alister will do what is right ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6396 len. 10]: `` He will do what he thinks right ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6397 len. 9]: `` Is not that enough , mother ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6398 len. 19]: `` No , '' she answered angrily ; `` he must do the thing that is right . ''
Parsing [sent. 6399 len. 8]: `` Whether he knows it or not ?
Parsing [sent. 6400 len. 10]: Could he do the thing he thought wrong ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6401 len. 4]: She was silent .
Parsing [sent. 6402 len. 25]: `` Mother dear , '' resumed lan , `` the only Way to get at what IS right is to do what seems right .
Parsing [sent. 6403 len. 11]: Even if we mistake there is no other way ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6404 len. 10]: `` You would do evil that good may come !
Parsing [sent. 6405 len. 5]: Oh , Ian ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6406 len. 29]: `` No , mother ; evil that is not seen to be evil by one willing and trying to do right , is not counted evil to him .
Parsing [sent. 6407 len. 26]: It is evil only to the person who either knows it to be evil , or does not care whether it be or not . ''
Parsing [sent. 6408 len. 7]: `` That is dangerous doctrine ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6409 len. 55]: `` I will go farther , mother , and say , that for Alister to do what you thought right , if he did not think it right himself -- even if you were right and he wrong -- would be for him to do wrong , and blind himself to the truth . ''
Parsing [sent. 6410 len. 22]: `` A man may be to blame that he is not able to see the truth , '' said the mother .
Parsing [sent. 6411 len. 26]: `` That is very true , but hardly such a man as Alister , who would sooner die than do the thing he believed wrong .
Parsing [sent. 6412 len. 17]: But why should you take it for granted that Alister will think differently from you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6413 len. 9]: `` We do n't always think alike . ''
Parsing [sent. 6414 len. 22]: `` In matters of right and wrong , I never knew him or me think differently from you , mother ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6415 len. 10]: `` He is very fond of the girl ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6416 len. 4]: `` And justly .
Parsing [sent. 6417 len. 15]: I never saw one more in earnest , or more anxious to learn . ''
Parsing [sent. 6418 len. 11]: `` She might well be teachable to such teachers ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6419 len. 20]: `` I do n't see that she has ever sought to commend herself to either of us , mother .
Parsing [sent. 6420 len. 17]: I believe her heart just opened to the realities she had never had shown her before .
Parsing [sent. 6421 len. 16]: Come what may , she will never forget the things we have talked about . ''
Parsing [sent. 6422 len. 9]: `` Nothing would make me trust her ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6423 len. 4]: `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6424 len. 10]: `` She comes of an ' abominable breed . ''
Parsing [sent. 6425 len. 20]: `` Is it your part , mother , to make her suffer for the sins of her fathers ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6426 len. 7]: `` I make her suffer ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6427 len. 27]: `` Certainly , mother -- by changing your mind toward her , and suspecting her , the moment you learn cause to condemn her father . ''
Parsing [sent. 6428 len. 12]: `` The sins of the fathers are visited on the children !
Parsing [sent. 6429 len. 8]: -- You will not dispute that ? '
Parsing [sent. 6430 len. 19]: `` I will grant more -- that the sins of the fathers are often reproduced in the children .
Parsing [sent. 6431 len. 20]: But it is nowhere said , ` Thou shalt visit the sins of the fathers on the children . '
Parsing [sent. 6432 len. 8]: God puts no vengeance into our hands .
Parsing [sent. 6433 len. 15]: I fear you are in danger of being unjust to the girl , mother !
Parsing [sent. 6434 len. 15]: -- but then you do not know her so well as we do ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6435 len. 5]: `` Of course not !
Parsing [sent. 6436 len. 11]: Every boy understands a woman better than his mother ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6437 len. 9]: `` The thing is exceedingly annoying , mother !
Parsing [sent. 6438 len. 10]: Let us go and find Alister at once ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6439 len. 15]: `` He will take it like a man of sense , I trust ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6440 len. 4]: `` He will .
Parsing [sent. 6441 len. 14]: It will trouble him terribly , but he will do as he ought .
Parsing [sent. 6442 len. 27]: Give him time and I do n't believe there is a man in the world to whom the right comes out clearer than to Alister . ''
Parsing [sent. 6443 len. 8]: The mother answered only with a sigh .
Parsing [sent. 6444 len. 23]: `` Many a man , '' remarked Ian , `` has been saved through what men call an unfortunate love affair ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6445 len. 16]: `` Many a man has been lost by having his own way in one ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6446 len. 4]: rejoined the mother .
Parsing [sent. 6447 len. 22]: `` As to LOST , I would not make up my mind about that for a few centuries or so ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6448 len. 4]: returned lan . ''
Parsing [sent. 6449 len. 17]: A man may be allowed his own way for the discipline to result from it . ''
Parsing [sent. 6450 len. 16]: `` I trust , lan , you will not encourage him in any folly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6451 len. 18]: `` I shall have nothing to do but encourage him in his first resolve , mother ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6452 len. 7]: CHAPTER III HOW ALISTER TOOK IT .
Parsing [sent. 6453 len. 13]: They could not find Alister , who had gone to the smithy .
Parsing [sent. 6454 len. 8]: It was tea-time before he came home .
Parsing [sent. 6455 len. 13]: As soon as he entered , his mother handed him the letter .
Parsing [sent. 6456 len. 36]: He read it without a word , laid it on the table beside his plate , and began to drink his tea , his eyes gleaming with a strange light , lan kept silence also .
Parsing [sent. 6457 len. 17]: Mrs. Macruadh cast a quick glance , now at the one , now at the other .
Parsing [sent. 6458 len. 12]: She was in great anxiety , and could scarce restrain herself .
Parsing [sent. 6459 len. 21]: She knew her boys full of inbred dignity and strong conscience , but was nevertheless doubtful how they would act .
Parsing [sent. 6460 len. 22]: They could not feel as she felt , else would the hot blood of their race have at once boiled over !
Parsing [sent. 6461 len. 21]: Had she searched herself she might have discovered a latent dread that they might be nearer the right than she .
Parsing [sent. 6462 len. 24]: Painfully she watched them , half conscious of a traitor in her bosom , judging the world 's judgment and not God 's .
Parsing [sent. 6463 len. 27]: Her sons seemed on the point of concluding as she would not have them conclude : they would side with the young woman against their mother !
Parsing [sent. 6464 len. 24]: The reward of parents who have tried to be good , may be to learn , with a joyous humility from their children .
Parsing [sent. 6465 len. 17]: Mrs. Macruadh was capable of learning more , and was now going to have a lesson .
Parsing [sent. 6466 len. 15]: When Alister pushed back his chair and rose , she could refrain no longer .
Parsing [sent. 6467 len. 9]: She could not let him go in silence .
Parsing [sent. 6468 len. 12]: She must understand something of what was passing in his mind !
Parsing [sent. 6469 len. 11]: `` What do you think of THAT , Alister ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6470 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 6471 len. 23]: He turned to her with a faint smile , and answered , `` I am glad to know it , mother . ''
Parsing [sent. 6472 len. 5]: `` That is good .
Parsing [sent. 6473 len. 9]: I was afraid it would hurt you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6474 len. 17]: `` Seeing the thing is so , I am glad to be made aware of it .
Parsing [sent. 6475 len. 14]: The information itself you can not expect me to be pleased with ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6476 len. 8]: `` No , indeed , my son !
Parsing [sent. 6477 len. 7]: I am very sorry for you .
Parsing [sent. 6478 len. 20]: After being so taken with the young woman , -- '' Alister looked straight in his mother 's face .
Parsing [sent. 6479 len. 23]: `` You do not imagine , mother , '' he said , `` it will make any difference as to Mercy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6480 len. 7]: `` Not make any difference ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6481 len. 4]: echoed Mrs. Macruadh .
Parsing [sent. 6482 len. 12]: `` What is it possible you can mean , Alister ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6483 len. 28]: The anger that glowed in her dark eyes made her look yet handsomer , proving itself not a mean , though it might be a misplaced anger .
Parsing [sent. 6484 len. 18]: `` Is she different , mother , from what she was before you had the letter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6485 len. 11]: `` You did not then know what she was ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6486 len. 9]: `` Just as well as I do now .
Parsing [sent. 6487 len. 15]: I have no reason to think she is not what I thought her . ''
Parsing [sent. 6488 len. 11]: `` You thought her the daughter of a gentleman ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6489 len. 3]: `` Hardly .
Parsing [sent. 6490 len. 14]: I thought her a lady , and such I think her still . ''
Parsing [sent. 6491 len. 11]: `` Then you mean to go on with it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6492 len. 21]: `` Mother dear , '' said Alister , taking her by the hand , `` give ine a little time .
Parsing [sent. 6493 len. 28]: Not that I am in any doubt -- but the news has been such a blow to me that -- '' `` It must have been ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6494 len. 5]: said the mother . ''
Parsing [sent. 6495 len. 26]: -- that I am afraid of answering you out of the soreness of my pride , and Ian says the Truth is never angry . ''
Parsing [sent. 6496 len. 18]: `` I am quite willing you should do nothing in a hurry , '' said the mother .
Parsing [sent. 6497 len. 26]: She did not understand that he feared lest , in his indignation for Mercy , he should answer his mother as her son ought not .
Parsing [sent. 6498 len. 10]: `` I will take time , '' he replied .
Parsing [sent. 6499 len. 10]: `` And here is lan to help me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6500 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 6501 len. 8]: if only your father were here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6502 len. 7]: `` He may be , mother !
Parsing [sent. 6503 len. 13]: Anyhow I trust I shall do nothing he would not like ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6504 len. 20]: `` He would sooner see son of his marry the daughter of a cobbler than of a brewer ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6505 len. 8]: `` So would I , mother ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6506 len. 3]: said Alister .
Parsing [sent. 6507 len. 23]: `` I too , '' said lan , `` would much prefer that my sister-in-law 's father were not a brewer . ''
Parsing [sent. 6508 len. 32]: `` I suppose you are splitting some hair , lan , but I do n't see it , '' remarked his mother , who had begun to gather a little hope .
Parsing [sent. 6509 len. 14]: `` You will be back by supper-time , Alister , I suppose ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6510 len. 5]: `` Certainly , mother .
Parsing [sent. 6511 len. 9]: We are only going to the village . ''
Parsing [sent. 6512 len. 4]: The brothers went .
Parsing [sent. 6513 len. 12]: `` I knew everything you were thinking , '' said lan .
Parsing [sent. 6514 len. 7]: `` Of course you did ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6515 len. 3]: answered Alister .
Parsing [sent. 6516 len. 8]: `` But I am very sorry ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6517 len. 5]: `` So am I !
Parsing [sent. 6518 len. 7]: It is a terrible bore ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6519 len. 4]: A pause followed .
Parsing [sent. 6520 len. 10]: Alister burst into a laugh that was not merry .
Parsing [sent. 6521 len. 40]: `` It makes me think of the look on my father 's face , '' he said , `` once at the market , as he was putting in his pocket a bunch of more than usually dirty bank-notes .
Parsing [sent. 6522 len. 20]: The look seemed almost to be making apology that he was rny father -- the notes were SO DIRTY !
Parsing [sent. 6523 len. 11]: ` They 're better than they look , lad ! '
Parsing [sent. 6524 len. 4]: he said . ''
Parsing [sent. 6525 len. 10]: `` What ARE you thinking of , Alister ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6526 len. 16]: `` Of nothing you are not thinking of , lan , I hope in God !
Parsing [sent. 6527 len. 11]: Mr. Palmer 's money is worse than it looks . ''
Parsing [sent. 6528 len. 11]: `` You frightened me for a moment , Alister ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6529 len. 8]: `` How could I , lan ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6530 len. 8]: `` It was but a nervo-mechanical fright .
Parsing [sent. 6531 len. 13]: I knew well enough you could mean nothing I should not like .
Parsing [sent. 6532 len. 9]: But I see trouble ahead , Alister ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6533 len. 15]: `` We shall be called a pack of fools , but what of that !
Parsing [sent. 6534 len. 18]: We shall be told the money itself was clean , however dirty the hands that made it !
Parsing [sent. 6535 len. 4]: The money-grubs ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6536 len. 16]: `` I would rather see you hanged , than pocketing a shilling of it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6537 len. 6]: `` Of course you would !
Parsing [sent. 6538 len. 23]: But the man who could pocket it , will be relieved to find it is only his daughter I care about . ''
Parsing [sent. 6539 len. 11]: `` There will be difficulty , Alister , I fear .
Parsing [sent. 6540 len. 9]: How much have you said to Mercy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6541 len. 8]: `` I have SAID nothing definite . ''
Parsing [sent. 6542 len. 6]: `` But she understands ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6543 len. 8]: `` I think -- I hope so .
Parsing [sent. 6544 len. 13]: -- Do n't you think Christina is much improved , lan ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6545 len. 7]: `` She is more pleasant . ''
Parsing [sent. 6546 len. 9]: `` She is quite attentive to you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6547 len. 11]: `` She is pleased with me for saving her life .
Parsing [sent. 6548 len. 17]: She does not like me -- and I have just arrived at not disliking her . ''
Parsing [sent. 6549 len. 10]: `` There is a great change on her ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6550 len. 12]: `` I doubt if there is any IN her though ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6551 len. 14]: `` She may be only amusing herself with us in this outlandish place !
Parsing [sent. 6552 len. 11]: Mercy , I am sure , is quite different ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6553 len. 10]: `` I would trust her with anything , Alister .
Parsing [sent. 6554 len. 11]: That girl would die for the man she loved ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6555 len. 25]: `` I would rather have her love , though we should never meet in this world , than the lands of my fathers ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6556 len. 8]: `` What will you do then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6557 len. 19]: `` I will go to Mr. Palmer , and say to him : ` Give me your daughter .
Parsing [sent. 6558 len. 15]: I am a poor man , but we shall have enough to live upon .
Parsing [sent. 6559 len. 9]: I believe she will be happy . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 6560 len. 18]: `` I will answer for him : ' I have the greatest regard for you , Macruadh .
Parsing [sent. 6561 len. 30]: You are a gentleman , and that you are poor is not of the slightest consequence ; Mercy 's dowry shall be worthy the lady of a chief ! '
Parsing [sent. 6562 len. 7]: -- What then , Alister ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6563 len. 19]: `` Fathers that love money must be glad to get rid of their daughters without a. dowry ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6564 len. 21]: `` Yes , perhaps , when they are misers , or money is scarce , or wanted for something else .
Parsing [sent. 6565 len. 28]: But when a poor man of position wanted to marry his daughter , a parent like Mr. Palmer would doubtless regard her dowry as a good investment .
Parsing [sent. 6566 len. 11]: You must not think to escape that way , Alister !
Parsing [sent. 6567 len. 7]: What would you answer him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6568 len. 25]: `` I would say , ` My dear sir , ' -- I may say ` My dear sir , ' may I not ?
Parsing [sent. 6569 len. 9]: there is something about the man I like !
Parsing [sent. 6570 len. 9]: -- ' I do not want your money .
Parsing [sent. 6571 len. 7]: I will not have your money .
Parsing [sent. 6572 len. 14]: Give me your daughter , and my soul will bless you . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 6573 len. 24]: `` Suppose he should reply , ' Do you think I am going to send my daughter from my house like a beggar ?
Parsing [sent. 6574 len. 7]: No , no , my boy !
Parsing [sent. 6575 len. 7]: she must carry something with her !
Parsing [sent. 6576 len. 14]: If beggars married beggars , the world would be full of beggars ! '
Parsing [sent. 6577 len. 8]: -- what would you say then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6578 len. 15]: `` I would tell him I had conscientious scruples about taking his money . ''
Parsing [sent. 6579 len. 19]: `` He would tell you you were a fool , and not to be trusted with a wife .
Parsing [sent. 6580 len. 8]: ` Who ever heard such rubbish ! '
Parsing [sent. 6581 len. 4]: he would say .
Parsing [sent. 6582 len. 5]: ` Scruples , indeed !
Parsing [sent. 6583 len. 6]: You must get over them !
Parsing [sent. 6584 len. 5]: What are they ? '
Parsing [sent. 6585 len. 8]: -- What would you say then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6586 len. 36]: `` If it came to that , I should have no choice but tell him I had insuperable objections to the way his fortune was made , and could not consent to share it . ''
Parsing [sent. 6587 len. 25]: `` He would protest himself insulted , and swear , if his money was not good enough for you , neither was his daughter .
Parsing [sent. 6588 len. 4]: What then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6589 len. 8]: `` I would appeal to Mercy . ''
Parsing [sent. 6590 len. 6]: `` She is too young .
Parsing [sent. 6591 len. 16]: It would be sad to set one of her years at variance with her family .
Parsing [sent. 6592 len. 12]: I almost think I would rather you ran away with her .
Parsing [sent. 6593 len. 32]: It is a terrible thing to go into a house and destroy the peace of those relations which are at the root of all that is good in the world . ''
Parsing [sent. 6594 len. 5]: `` I know it !
Parsing [sent. 6595 len. 4]: I know it !
Parsing [sent. 6596 len. 5]: That is my trouble !
Parsing [sent. 6597 len. 18]: I am not afraid of Mercy 's courage , and I am sure she would hold out .
Parsing [sent. 6598 len. 15]: I am certain nothing would make her marry the man she did not love .
Parsing [sent. 6599 len. 16]: But to turn the house into a hell about her -- I shrink from that !
Parsing [sent. 6600 len. 18]: -- Do you count it necessary to provide against every contingency before taking the first step ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6601 len. 6]: `` Indeed I do not !
Parsing [sent. 6602 len. 6]: The first step is enough .
Parsing [sent. 6603 len. 11]: When that step has landed us , we start afresh .
Parsing [sent. 6604 len. 14]: But of all things you must not lose your temper with the man .
Parsing [sent. 6605 len. 13]: However despicable his money , you are his suitor for his daughter !
Parsing [sent. 6606 len. 14]: And he may possibly not think you half good enough for her . ''
Parsing [sent. 6607 len. 13]: `` That would be a grand way out of the difficulty ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6608 len. 4]: `` How ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6609 len. 13]: `` It would leave me far freer to deal with her . ''
Parsing [sent. 6610 len. 3]: `` Perhaps .
Parsing [sent. 6611 len. 19]: And in any case , the more we can honestly avoid reference to his money , the better .
Parsing [sent. 6612 len. 9]: We are not called on to rebuke . ''
Parsing [sent. 6613 len. 26]: `` Small is my inclination to allude to it -- so long as not a stiver of it seeks to cross to the Macruadh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6614 len. 7]: `` That is fast as fate .
Parsing [sent. 6615 len. 39]: But there is another thing , Alister : I fear lest you should ever forget that her birth and her connections are no more a part of the woman 's self than her poverty or her wealth . ''
Parsing [sent. 6616 len. 7]: `` I know it , Ian .
Parsing [sent. 6617 len. 7]: I will not forget it . ''
Parsing [sent. 6618 len. 11]: `` There must never be a word concerning them ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6619 len. 7]: `` Nor a thought , Ian !
Parsing [sent. 6620 len. 12]: In God 's name I will be true to her . ''
Parsing [sent. 6621 len. 11]: They found Annie of the shop in a sad way .
Parsing [sent. 6622 len. 34]: She had just had a letter from Lachlan , stating that he had not been well for some time , and that there was little prospect of his being able to fetch her .
Parsing [sent. 6623 len. 23]: He prayed her therefore to go out to him ; and had sent money to pay her passage and her mother 's .
Parsing [sent. 6624 len. 7]: `` When do you go ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6625 len. 4]: asked the chief .
Parsing [sent. 6626 len. 20]: `` My mother fears the voyage , and is very unwilling to turn her back on her own country .
Parsing [sent. 6627 len. 14]: But oh , if Lachlan die , and me not with him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6628 len. 6]: She could say no more .
Parsing [sent. 6629 len. 11]: `` He shall not die for want of you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6630 len. 4]: said the laird .
Parsing [sent. 6631 len. 9]: `` I will talk to your mother . ''
Parsing [sent. 6632 len. 7]: He went into the room behind .
Parsing [sent. 6633 len. 6]: Ian remained in the shop .
Parsing [sent. 6634 len. 10]: `` Of course you must go , Annie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6635 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 6636 len. 8]: `` Indeed , sir , I must !
Parsing [sent. 6637 len. 11]: But how to persuade my mother I do not know !
Parsing [sent. 6638 len. 10]: And I can not leave her even for Lachlan .
Parsing [sent. 6639 len. 31]: No one would nurse him more tenderly than she ; but she has a horror of the salt water , and what she most dreads is being buried in it .
Parsing [sent. 6640 len. 9]: She imagines herself drowning to all eternity ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6641 len. 8]: `` My brother will persuade her . ''
Parsing [sent. 6642 len. 7]: `` I hope so , sir .
Parsing [sent. 6643 len. 7]: I was just coming to him !
Parsing [sent. 6644 len. 31]: I should never hold up my head again -- in this world or the next -- either if I did not go , or if I went without my mother !
Parsing [sent. 6645 len. 24]: Aunt Conal told me , about a month since , that I was going a long journey , and would never come back .
Parsing [sent. 6646 len. 19]: I asked her if I was to die on the way , but she would not answer me .
Parsing [sent. 6647 len. 20]: Anyhow I 'm not fit to be his wife , if I 'm not ready to die for him !
Parsing [sent. 6648 len. 30]: Some people think it wrong to marry anybody going to die , but at the longest , you know , sir , you must part sooner than you would !
Parsing [sent. 6649 len. 8]: Not many are allowed to die together !
Parsing [sent. 6650 len. 22]: -- You do n't think , do you , sir , that marriages go for nothing in the other world ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6651 len. 17]: She spoke with a white face and brave eyes , and Ian was glad at heart .
Parsing [sent. 6652 len. 12]: `` I do not , Annie , '' he answered . ''
Parsing [sent. 6653 len. 10]: ` The gifts of God are without repentance . '
Parsing [sent. 6654 len. 15]: He did not give you and Lachlan to each other to part you again !
Parsing [sent. 6655 len. 23]: Though you are not married yet , it is all the same so long as you are true to each other . ''
Parsing [sent. 6656 len. 14]: `` Thank you , sir ; you always make me feel strong ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6657 len. 7]: Alister came from the back room .
Parsing [sent. 6658 len. 17]: `` I think your mother sees it not quite so difficult now , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 6659 len. 13]: The next time they went , they found them preparing to go .
Parsing [sent. 6660 len. 22]: Now Ian had nearly finished the book he was writing about Russia , and could not begin another all at once .
Parsing [sent. 6661 len. 55]: He must not stay at home doing nothing , and he thought that , as things were going from bad to worse in the highlands , he might make a voyage to Canada , visit those of his clan , and see what ought to be done for such as must soon follow them .
Parsing [sent. 6662 len. 20]: He would presently have a little money in his possession , and believed he could not spend it better .
Parsing [sent. 6663 len. 26]: He made up his mind therefore to accompany Annie and her mother , which resolve overcame the last of the old woman 's lingering reluctance .
Parsing [sent. 6664 len. 49]: He did not like leaving Alister at such a critical point in his history ; but he said to himself that a man might be helped too much ; arid it might come that he and Mercy were in as much need of a refuge as the clan .
Parsing [sent. 6665 len. 40]: I can not say NO worldly pride mingled in the chief 's contempt for the distiller 's money ; his righteous soul was not yet clear of its inherited judgments as to what is dignified and what is not .
Parsing [sent. 6666 len. 21]: He had in him still the prejudice of the landholder , for ages instinctive , against both manufacture and trade .
Parsing [sent. 6667 len. 35]: Various things had combined to foster in him also the belief that trade at least was never free from more or less of unfair dealing , and was therefore in itself a low pursuit .
Parsing [sent. 6668 len. 28]: He had not argued that nothing the Father of men has decreed can in its nature be contemptible , but must be capable of being nobly done .
Parsing [sent. 6669 len. 32]: In the things that some one must do , the doer ranks in God 's sight , and ought to rank among his fellow-men , according to how he does it .
Parsing [sent. 6670 len. 16]: The higher the calling the more contemptible the man who therein pursues his own ends .
Parsing [sent. 6671 len. 31]: The humblest calling , followed on the principles of the divine caller , is a true and divine calling , be it scavenging , handicraft , shop-keeping , or book-making .
Parsing [sent. 6672 len. 19]: Oh for the day when God and not the king shall be regarded as the fountain of honour .
Parsing [sent. 6673 len. 28]: But the Macruadh looked upon the calling of the brewer or distiller as from the devil : he was not called of God to brew or distil !
Parsing [sent. 6674 len. 14]: From childhood his mother had taught him a horror of gain by corruption .
Parsing [sent. 6675 len. 71]: She had taught , and he had learned , that the poorest of all justifications , the least fit to serve the turn of gentleman , logician , or Christian , was -- `` If I do not touch this pitch , another will ; there will be just as much harm done ; AND ANOTHER INSTEAD OF ME WILL HAVE THE BENEFIT ; therefore it can not defile me .
Parsing [sent. 6676 len. 12]: -- Offences must come , therefore I will do them ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6677 len. 14]: `` Imagine our Lord in the brewing trade instead of the carpentering ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6678 len. 4]: she would say .
Parsing [sent. 6679 len. 40]: That better beer was provided by the good brewer would not go far for brewer or drinker , she said : it mattered little that , by drinking good beer , the drunkard lived to be drunk the oftener .
Parsing [sent. 6680 len. 38]: A brewer might do much to reduce drinking ; but that would be to reduce a princely income to a modest livelihood , and to content himself with the baker 's daughter instead of the duke 's !
Parsing [sent. 6681 len. 19]: It followed that the Macruadh would rather have robbed a church than touched Mr. Peregrine Palmer 's money .
Parsing [sent. 6682 len. 19]: To rifle the tombs of the dead would have seemed to him pure righteousness beside sharing in that .
Parsing [sent. 6683 len. 15]: He could give Mercy up ; he could NOT take such money with her !
Parsing [sent. 6684 len. 49]: Much as he loved her , separate as he saw her , clearly as she was to him a woman undefiled and straight from God , it was yet a trial to him that she should be the daughter of a person whose manufacture and trade were such .
Parsing [sent. 6685 len. 43]: After much consideration , it was determined in the family conclave , that Ian should accompany the two women to Canada , note how things were going , and conclude what had best be done , should further exodus be found necessary .
Parsing [sent. 6686 len. 38]: As , however , there had come better news of Lachlan , and it was plain he was in no immediate danger , they would not , for several reasons , start before the month of September .
Parsing [sent. 6687 len. 14]: A few of the poorest of the clan resolved to go with them .
Parsing [sent. 6688 len. 24]: Partly for their sakes , partly because his own provision would be small , Ian would take his passage also in the steerage .
Parsing [sent. 6689 len. 4]: CHAPTER IV LOVE .
Parsing [sent. 6690 len. 8]: Christina went back to London considerably changed .
Parsing [sent. 6691 len. 28]: Her beauty was greater far , for there was a new element in it -- a certain atmosphere of distances and shadows gave mystery to her landscape .
Parsing [sent. 6692 len. 21]: Her weather , that is her mood , was now subject to changes which to many made her more attractive .
Parsing [sent. 6693 len. 26]: Fits of wild gaiety alternated with glooms , through which would break flashes of feline playfulness , where pat and scratch were a little mixed .
Parsing [sent. 6694 len. 27]: She had more admirers than ever , for she had developed points capable of interesting men of somewhat higher development than those she had hitherto pleased .
Parsing [sent. 6695 len. 14]: At the same time she was more wayward and imperious with her courtiers .
Parsing [sent. 6696 len. 49]: Gladly would she have thrown all the flattery once so coveted into the rag-bag of creation , to have one approving smile from the grave-looking , gracious man , whom she knew happier , wandering alone over the hills , than if she were walking by his side .
Parsing [sent. 6697 len. 33]: For an hour she would persuade herself that he cared for her a little ; the next she would comfort herself with the small likelihood of his meeting another lady in Glenruadh .
Parsing [sent. 6698 len. 27]: But then he had been such a traveller , had seen so much of the great world , that perhaps he was already lost to her !
Parsing [sent. 6699 len. 42]: It seemed but too probable , when she recalled the sadness with which he seemed sometimes overshadowed : it could not be a religious gloom , for when he spoke of God his face shone , and his words were strong !
Parsing [sent. 6700 len. 40]: I think she mistook a certain gravity , like that of the Merchant of Venice , for sorrowfulness ; though doubtless the peculiarity of his loss , as well as the loss itself , did sometimes make him sad .
Parsing [sent. 6701 len. 31]: She had tried on him her little arts of subjugation , but the moment she began to love him , she not only saw their uselessness , but hated them .
Parsing [sent. 6702 len. 40]: Her repellent behaviour to her admirers , and her occasional excitement and oddity , caused her mother some anxiety , but as the season came to a close , she grew gayer , and was at times absolutely bewitching .
Parsing [sent. 6703 len. 26]: The mother wished to go northward by degrees , paying visits on the way ; but her plan met with no approbation from the girls .
Parsing [sent. 6704 len. 36]: Christina longed for the presence and voice of Ian in the cottage-parlour , Mercy for a hill-side with the chief ; both longed to hear them speak to each other in their own great way .
Parsing [sent. 6705 len. 49]: And they talked so of the delights of their highland home , that the mother began to feel the mountains , the sea , and the islands , drawing her to a land of peace , where things went well , and the world knew how to live .
Parsing [sent. 6706 len. 16]: But the stormiest months of her life were about to pass among those dumb mountains !
Parsing [sent. 6707 len. 20]: After a long and eager journey , the girls were once more in their rooms at the New House .
Parsing [sent. 6708 len. 21]: Mercy went to her window , and stood gazing from it upon the mountain-world , faint-lighted by the northern twilight .
Parsing [sent. 6709 len. 41]: She might have said with Portia : -- `` This night methinks is but the daylight sick ; It looks a little paler : 't is a day , Such as the day is when the sun is hid . ''
Parsing [sent. 6710 len. 34]: She could see the dark bulk of the hills , sharpened to a clear edge against the pellucid horizon , but with no colour , and no visible featuring of their great fronts .
Parsing [sent. 6711 len. 29]: When the sun rose , it would reveal innumerable varieties of surface , by the mottling of endless shadows ; now all was smooth as an unawakened conscience .
Parsing [sent. 6712 len. 135]: By the shape of a small top that rose against the greenish sky betwixt the parting lines of two higher hills , where it seemed to peep out over the marge into the infinite , as a little man through the gap between the heads of taller neighbours , she knew the roof of THE TOMB ; and she thought how , just below there , away as it seemed in the high-lifted solitudes of heaven , she had lain in the clutches of death , all the time watched and defended by the angel of a higher life who had been with her ever since first she came to Glenruadh , waking her out of such a stupidity , such a non-existence , as now she could scarce see possible to human being .
Parsing [sent. 6713 len. 50]: It was true her waking had been one with her love to that human East which first she saw as she opened her eyes , and whence first the light of her morning had flowed -- the man who had been and was to her the window of God !
Parsing [sent. 6714 len. 8]: But why should that make her doubt ?
Parsing [sent. 6715 len. 31]: God made man and woman to love each other : why should not the waking to love and the waking to truth come together , seeing both were of God ?
Parsing [sent. 6716 len. 24]: If the chief were never to speak to her again , she would never go back from what she had learned of him !
Parsing [sent. 6717 len. 25]: If she ever became careless of truth and life and God , it would but show that she had never truly loved the chief !
Parsing [sent. 6718 len. 34]: As she stood gazing on the hill-top , high landmark of her history , she felt as if the earth were holding her up toward heaven , an offering to the higher life .
Parsing [sent. 6719 len. 27]: The hill grew an altar of prayer on which her soul was lying , dead until taken up into life by the arms of the Father .
Parsing [sent. 6720 len. 7]: A deep content pervaded her heart .
Parsing [sent. 6721 len. 22]: She turned with her weight of peace , lay down , and went to sleep in the presence of her Life .
Parsing [sent. 6722 len. 38]: Christina looked also from her window , but her thoughts were not like Mercy 's , for her heart was mainly filled , not with love of Ian , but with desire that Ian should love her .
Parsing [sent. 6723 len. 16]: She longed to be his queen -- the woman of all women he had seen .
Parsing [sent. 6724 len. 17]: The sweet repose of the sleeping world wrought in her -- not peace , but weakness .
Parsing [sent. 6725 len. 25]: Her soul kept leaning towards Ian ; she longed for his arms to start out the alien nature lying so self-satisfied all about her .
Parsing [sent. 6726 len. 15]: To her the presence of God took shape as an emptiness -- an absence .
Parsing [sent. 6727 len. 18]: The resting world appeared to her cold , unsympathetic , heedless ; its peace was but heartlessness .
Parsing [sent. 6728 len. 23]: The soft pellucid chrysolite of passive heavenly thought , was a merest arrangement , a common fact , meaning nothing to her .
Parsing [sent. 6729 len. 24]: She was hungry , not merely after bliss , but after distinction in bliss ; not after growth , but after acknowledged superiority .
Parsing [sent. 6730 len. 45]: She needed to learn that she was nobody -- that if the world were peopled with creatures like her , it would be no more worth sustaining than were it a world of sand , of which no man could build even a hut .
Parsing [sent. 6731 len. 15]: Still , by her need of another , God was laying hold of her .
Parsing [sent. 6732 len. 42]: As by the law is the knowledge of sin , so by love is selfishness rampantly roused -- to be at last , like death , swallowed up in victory -- the victory of the ideal self that dwells in God .
Parsing [sent. 6733 len. 23]: All night she dreamed sad dreams of Ian in the embrace of a lovely woman , without word or look for her .
Parsing [sent. 6734 len. 14]: She woke weeping , and said to herself that it could not be .
Parsing [sent. 6735 len. 8]: He COULD not be taken from her !
Parsing [sent. 6736 len. 5]: it was against nature !
Parsing [sent. 6737 len. 11]: Soul , brain , and heart , claimed him hers !
Parsing [sent. 6738 len. 20]: How could another possess what , in the testimony of her whole consciousness , was hers and hers alone !
Parsing [sent. 6739 len. 15]: Love asserts an innate and irreversible right of profoundest property in the person loved .
Parsing [sent. 6740 len. 14]: It is an instinct -- but how wrongly , undivinely , falsely interpreted !
Parsing [sent. 6741 len. 5]: Hence so many tears !
Parsing [sent. 6742 len. 22]: Hence a law of nature , deep written in the young heart , seems often set utterly at nought by circumstance !
Parsing [sent. 6743 len. 20]: But the girl in her dejection and doubt , was worth far more than in her content and confidence .
Parsing [sent. 6744 len. 38]: She was even now the richer by the knowledge of sorrow , and she was on the way to know that she needed help , on the way to hate herself , to become capable of loving .
Parsing [sent. 6745 len. 18]: Life could never be the same to her , and the farther from the same the better !
Parsing [sent. 6746 len. 22]: The beauty came down in the morning pale and dim and white-lipped , like a flower that had had no water .
Parsing [sent. 6747 len. 18]: Mercy was fresh and rosy , with a luminous mist of loveliness over her plain unfinished features .
Parsing [sent. 6748 len. 12]: Already had they begun to change in the direction of beauty .
Parsing [sent. 6749 len. 23]: Christina 's eyes burned ; in Mercy 's shone something of the light by which a soul may walk and not stumble .
Parsing [sent. 6750 len. 24]: In the eyes of both was expectation , in the eyes of the one confident , in the eyes of the other anxious .
Parsing [sent. 6751 len. 18]: As soon as they found themselves alone together , eyes sought eyes , and met in understanding .
Parsing [sent. 6752 len. 19]: They had not made confidantes of each other , each guessed well , and was well guessed at .
Parsing [sent. 6753 len. 8]: They did not speculate ; they understood .
Parsing [sent. 6754 len. 17]: In like manner , Mercy and Alister understood each other , but not Christina and Ian .
Parsing [sent. 6755 len. 10]: Neither of these knew the feelings of the other .
Parsing [sent. 6756 len. 23]: Without a word they rose , put on their hats , left the house , and took the road toward the valley .
Parsing [sent. 6757 len. 25]: About half-way to the root of the ridge , they came in sight of the ruined castle ; Mercy stopped with a little cry .
Parsing [sent. 6758 len. 3]: `` Look !
Parsing [sent. 6759 len. 3]: Chrissy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6760 len. 5]: she said , pointing .
Parsing [sent. 6761 len. 38]: On the corner next them , close by the pepper-pot turret , sat the two men , in what seemed to loving eyes a dangerous position , but to the mountaineers themselves a comfortable coin of vantage .
Parsing [sent. 6762 len. 13]: The girls thought , `` They are looking out for us ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6763 len. 10]: but Ian was there only because Alister was there .
Parsing [sent. 6764 len. 6]: The men waved their bonnets .
Parsing [sent. 6765 len. 6]: Christina responded with her handkerchief .
Parsing [sent. 6766 len. 18]: The men disappeared from their perch , and were with the ladies before they reached the ridge .
Parsing [sent. 6767 len. 17]: There was no embarrassment on either side , though a few cheeks were rosier than usual .
Parsing [sent. 6768 len. 13]: To the chief , Mercy was far beyond his memory of her .
Parsing [sent. 6769 len. 24]: Not her face only , but her every movement bore witness to a deeper pleasure , a greater freedom in life than before .
Parsing [sent. 6770 len. 11]: `` Why were you in such a dangerous place ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6771 len. 3]: asked Christina .
Parsing [sent. 6772 len. 13]: `` We were looking out for you , '' answered Alister . ''
Parsing [sent. 6773 len. 13]: From there we could see you the moment you came out . ''
Parsing [sent. 6774 len. 12]: `` Why did n't you come and meet us then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6775 len. 10]: `` Because we wanted to watch you coming . ''
Parsing [sent. 6776 len. 3]: `` Spies !
Parsing [sent. 6777 len. 12]: -- I hope , Mercy , we were behaving ourselves properly !
Parsing [sent. 6778 len. 9]: I had no idea we were watched ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6779 len. 16]: `` We thought you had quarrelled ; neither said a word to the other . ''
Parsing [sent. 6780 len. 8]: Mercy looked up ; Christina looked down .
Parsing [sent. 6781 len. 10]: `` Could you hear us at that height ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6782 len. 3]: asked Mercy .
Parsing [sent. 6783 len. 14]: `` How could we when there was not a word to hear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6784 len. 10]: `` How did you know we were silent ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6785 len. 15]: `` We might have known by the way you walked , '' replied Alister .
Parsing [sent. 6786 len. 20]: `` But if you had spoken we should have heard , for sound travels far among the mountains ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6787 len. 10]: `` Then I think it was a shame ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6788 len. 3]: said Christina .
Parsing [sent. 6789 len. 16]: `` How could you tell that we might not object to your hearing us ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6790 len. 8]: `` We never thought of that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6791 len. 3]: said Alister .
Parsing [sent. 6792 len. 6]: `` I am very sorry .
Parsing [sent. 6793 len. 9]: We shall certainly not be guilty again ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6794 len. 13]: `` What men you are for taking everything in downright earnest ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6795 len. 22]: cried Christina ; '' -- as if we could have anything to say we should wish YOU not to hear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6796 len. 13]: She pat a little emphasis on the YOU , hut not much .
Parsing [sent. 6797 len. 16]: Alister heard it as if Mercy had said it , and smiled a pleased smile .
Parsing [sent. 6798 len. 40]: `` It will be a glad day for the world , '' he said , `` when secrecy is over , and every man may speak out the thing that is in him , without danger of offence ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6799 len. 36]: In her turn , Christina heard the words as if spoken with reference to Ian though not by him , and took them to hint at the difficulty of saying what was in his heart .
Parsing [sent. 6800 len. 41]: She had such an idea of her superiority because of her father 's wealth and fancied position , that she at once concluded Ian dreaded rejection with scorn , for it was not even as if he were the chief .
Parsing [sent. 6801 len. 37]: However poor , Alister was at least the head of a family , and might set SIR before , and BARONET after his name -- not that her father would think that much of a dignity !
Parsing [sent. 6802 len. 21]: -- but no younger son of whatever rank , would be good enough for her in her father 's eyes !
Parsing [sent. 6803 len. 27]: At the same time she had a choice as well as her father , and he should find she too had a will of her own !
Parsing [sent. 6804 len. 13]: `` But was it not a dangerous place to be in ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6805 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 6806 len. 8]: `` It is a little crumbly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6807 len. 4]: confessed Ian . ''
Parsing [sent. 6808 len. 19]: -- That reminds me , Alister , we must have a bout at the old walls before long !
Parsing [sent. 6809 len. 40]: -- Ever since Alister was ten years old , '' he went on in explanation to Christina , `` he and I have been patching and pointing at the old hulk -- the stranded ship of our poor fortunes .
Parsing [sent. 6810 len. 34]: I showed you , did I not , the ship in our coat of arms -- the galley at least , in which , they say , we arrived at the island ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6811 len. 6]: `` Yes , I remember .
Parsing [sent. 6812 len. 18]: -- But you do n't mean you do mason 's work as well as everything else ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6813 len. 3]: exclaimed Christina .
Parsing [sent. 6814 len. 13]: `` Come ; we will show you , '' said the chief .
Parsing [sent. 6815 len. 9]: `` What do you do it for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6816 len. 5]: The brothers exchanged glances .
Parsing [sent. 6817 len. 29]: `` Would you count it sufficient reason , '' returned Ian , `` that we desired to preserve its testimony to the former status of our family ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6818 len. 11]: A pang of pleasure shot through the heart of Christina .
Parsing [sent. 6819 len. 15]: Passion is potent to twist in its favour whatever can possibly be so twisted .
Parsing [sent. 6820 len. 9]: Here was an indubitable indication of his thoughts !
Parsing [sent. 6821 len. 20]: He must make the most of himself , set what he could against the overwhelming advantages on her side !
Parsing [sent. 6822 len. 22]: In the eyes of a man of the world like her father , an old name was nothing beside new money !
Parsing [sent. 6823 len. 10]: still an old castle was always an old castle !
Parsing [sent. 6824 len. 18]: and that he cared about it for her sake made it to her at least worth something !
Parsing [sent. 6825 len. 11]: Ere she could give an answer , Ian went on .
Parsing [sent. 6826 len. 21]: `` But in truth , '' he said , `` we have always had a vague hope of its resurrection .
Parsing [sent. 6827 len. 11]: The dream of our boyhood was to rebuild the castle .
Parsing [sent. 6828 len. 12]: Every year it has grown more hopeless , and keeps receding .
Parsing [sent. 6829 len. 32]: But we have come to see how little it matters , and content ourselves with keeping up , for old love 's sake , what is left of the ruin . ''
Parsing [sent. 6830 len. 11]: `` How do you get up on the walls ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6831 len. 3]: asked Mercy .
Parsing [sent. 6832 len. 9]: `` Ah , that is a secret ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6833 len. 3]: said Ian .
Parsing [sent. 6834 len. 9]: `` Do tell us , '' pleaded Christina .
Parsing [sent. 6835 len. 18]: `` If you want very much to know , -- '' answered Ian , a little doubtfully .
Parsing [sent. 6836 len. 8]: `` I do , I do ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6837 len. 10]: `` Then I suppose we must tell you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6838 len. 10]: Yet more confirmation to the passion-prejudiced ears of Christina !
Parsing [sent. 6839 len. 23]: `` There is a stair , '' Ian went on , `` of which no one but our two selves knows anything .
Parsing [sent. 6840 len. 19]: Such stairs are common in old houses -- far commoner than people in towns have a notion of .
Parsing [sent. 6841 len. 23]: But there would not have been much of it left by this time , if we had n't taken care of it .
Parsing [sent. 6842 len. 36]: We were little fellows when we began , and it needed much contrivance , for we were not able to unseat the remnants of the broken steps , and replace them with new ones . ''
Parsing [sent. 6843 len. 10]: `` Do show it us , '' begged Christina .
Parsing [sent. 6844 len. 16]: `` We will keep it , '' said Alister , `` for some warm twilight .
Parsing [sent. 6845 len. 6]: Morning is not for ruins .
Parsing [sent. 6846 len. 7]: Yon mountain-side is calling to us .
Parsing [sent. 6847 len. 7]: Will you come , Mercy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6848 len. 5]: `` Oh yes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6849 len. 10]: cried Christina ; `` that will be much better !
Parsing [sent. 6850 len. 4]: Come , Mercy !
Parsing [sent. 6851 len. 12]: You are up to a climb , I am sure ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6852 len. 13]: `` I ought to be , after such a long rest . ''
Parsing [sent. 6853 len. 10]: `` You may have forgotten how to climb ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6854 len. 3]: said Alister .
Parsing [sent. 6855 len. 11]: `` I dreamed too much of the hills for that !
Parsing [sent. 6856 len. 15]: And always the noise of London was changed into the rush of waters . ''
Parsing [sent. 6857 len. 10]: They had dropped a little behind the other pair .
Parsing [sent. 6858 len. 10]: `` Did you always climb your dream-hills alone ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6859 len. 3]: asked Alister .
Parsing [sent. 6860 len. 13]: She answered him with just a lift of her big dark eyes .
Parsing [sent. 6861 len. 26]: They walked slowly down the road till they came to Mrs. Conal 's path , passed her door unassailed , and went up the hill .
Parsing [sent. 6862 len. 6]: CHAPTER V PASSION AND PATIENCE .
Parsing [sent. 6863 len. 22]: It was a glorious morning , and as they climbed , the lightening air made their spirits rise with their steps .
Parsing [sent. 6864 len. 32]: Great masses of cloud hung beyond the edge of the world , and here and there towered foundationless in the sky -- huge tumulous heaps of white vapour with gray shadows .
Parsing [sent. 6865 len. 23]: The sun was strong , and poured down floods of light , but his heat was deliciously tempered by the mountain atmosphere .
Parsing [sent. 6866 len. 38]: There was no wind -- only an occasional movement as if the air itself were breathing -- just enough to let them feel they moved in no vacuum , but in the heart of a gentle ocean .
Parsing [sent. 6867 len. 25]: They came to the hut I have already described as the one chiefly inhabited by Hector of the Stags and Bob of the Angels .
Parsing [sent. 6868 len. 6]: It commanded a rare vision .
Parsing [sent. 6869 len. 8]: In every direction rose some cone-shaped hill .
Parsing [sent. 6870 len. 30]: The world lay in coloured waves before them , wild , rugged , and grand , with sheltering spots of beauty between , and the shine of lowly waters .
Parsing [sent. 6871 len. 30]: They tapped at the door of the hut , but there was no response ; they lifted the latch -- it had no lock -- and found neither within .
Parsing [sent. 6872 len. 45]: Alister and Mercy wandered a little higher , to the shadow of a great stone ; Christina went inside the hut and looked from its door upon the world ; Ian leaned against the side of it , and looked up to the sky .
Parsing [sent. 6873 len. 14]: Suddenly a few great drops fell -- it was hard to say whence .
Parsing [sent. 6874 len. 37]: The scattered clouds had been drawing a little nearer the sun , growing whiter as they approached him , and more had ascended from the horizon into the middle air , blue sky abounding between them .
Parsing [sent. 6875 len. 23]: A swift rain , like a rain of the early summer , began to fall , and grew to a heavy shower .
Parsing [sent. 6876 len. 33]: They were glorious drops that made that shower ; for the sun shone , and every drop was a falling gem , shining , sparkling like a diamond , as it fell .
Parsing [sent. 6877 len. 23]: It was a bounteous rain , coming from near the zenith , and falling in straight lines direct from heaven to earth .
Parsing [sent. 6878 len. 24]: It wanted but sound to complete its charm , and that the bells of the heather gave , set ringing by the drops .
Parsing [sent. 6879 len. 22]: The heaven was filled with blue windows , and the rain seemed to come from them rather than from the clouds .
Parsing [sent. 6880 len. 75]: Into the rain rose the heads of the mountains , each clothed in its surplice of thin mist ; they seemed rising on tiptoe heavenward , eager to drink of the high-born comfort ; for the rain comes down , not upon the mown grass only , but upon the solitary and desert places also , where grass will never be -- `` the playgrounds of the young angels , '' Bob called them .
Parsing [sent. 6881 len. 17]: `` Do come in , '' said Christina ; `` you will get quite wet ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6882 len. 5]: He turned towards her .
Parsing [sent. 6883 len. 8]: She stepped back , and he entered .
Parsing [sent. 6884 len. 15]: Like one a little weary , he sat down on Hector 's old chair .
Parsing [sent. 6885 len. 7]: `` Is anything the matter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6886 len. 7]: asked Christina , with genuine concern .
Parsing [sent. 6887 len. 20]: She saw that he was not quite like himself , that there was an unusual expression on his face .
Parsing [sent. 6888 len. 7]: He gave a faint apologetic smile .
Parsing [sent. 6889 len. 29]: `` As I stood there , '' he answered , `` a strange feeling came over me -- a foreboding , I suppose you would call it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6890 len. 21]: He paused ; Christina grew pale , and said , `` Wo n't you tell me what it was ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6891 len. 24]: `` It was an odd kind of conviction that the next time I stood there , it would not be in the body .
Parsing [sent. 6892 len. 10]: -- I think I shall not come back . ''
Parsing [sent. 6893 len. 5]: `` Come back ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6894 len. 14]: echoed Christina , fear beginning to sip at the cup of her heart .
Parsing [sent. 6895 len. 7]: `` Where are you going ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6896 len. 9]: `` I start for Canada next week . ''
Parsing [sent. 6897 len. 16]: She turned deadly white , and put out her hands , feeling blindly after support .
Parsing [sent. 6898 len. 6]: Ian started to his feet .
Parsing [sent. 6899 len. 8]: `` We have tired you out ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6900 len. 18]: he said in alarm , and took her by both hands to place her in the chair .
Parsing [sent. 6901 len. 6]: She did not hear him .
Parsing [sent. 6902 len. 30]: The world had grown dark about her , a hissing noise was in her ears , and she would have fallen had he not put his arm round her .
Parsing [sent. 6903 len. 13]: The moment she felt supported , she began to come to herself .
Parsing [sent. 6904 len. 13]: There was no pretence , however , no coquetry in her faintness .
Parsing [sent. 6905 len. 28]: Neither was it aught but misery and affection that made her lay her head on Ian 's shoulder , and burst into a violent fit of weeping .
Parsing [sent. 6906 len. 39]: Unused to real emotion , familiar only with the poverty-stricken , false emotion of conquest and gratified vanity , when the real emotion came she did not know how to deal with it , and it overpowered her .
Parsing [sent. 6907 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 6908 len. 3]: oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6909 len. 15]: she cried at length between her sobs , `` I am ashamed of myself !
Parsing [sent. 6910 len. 6]: I ca n't help it !
Parsing [sent. 6911 len. 6]: I ca n't help it !
Parsing [sent. 6912 len. 7]: What will you think of me !
Parsing [sent. 6913 len. 6]: I have disgraced myself ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6914 len. 35]: Ian had been far from any suspicion of the state of things , but he had had too much sorrowful experience to be able to keep his unwilling eyes closed to this new consternation .
Parsing [sent. 6915 len. 34]: The cold shower seemed to flood his soul ; the bright drops descending with such swiftness of beauty , instinct with sun-life , turned into points of icy steel that pierced his heart .
Parsing [sent. 6916 len. 7]: But he must not heed himself !
Parsing [sent. 6917 len. 6]: he must speak to her !
Parsing [sent. 6918 len. 12]: He must say something through the terrible shroud that infolded them !
Parsing [sent. 6919 len. 22]: `` You are as safe with me , '' he faltered , '' -- as safe as with your mother ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6920 len. 5]: `` I believe it !
Parsing [sent. 6921 len. 31]: I know it , '' she answered , still sobbing , but looking up with an expression of genuine integrity such as he had never seen on her face before .
Parsing [sent. 6922 len. 7]: `` But I AM sorry ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6923 len. 4]: she went on .
Parsing [sent. 6924 len. 18]: `` It is very weak , and very , very un -- un -- womanly of me !
Parsing [sent. 6925 len. 9]: But it came upon me all at once !
Parsing [sent. 6926 len. 8]: If I had only had some warning !
Parsing [sent. 6927 len. 10]: Oh , why did you not tell me before ?
Parsing [sent. 6928 len. 9]: Why did you not prepare me for it ?
Parsing [sent. 6929 len. 15]: You might have known what it would be to hear it so suddenly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6930 len. 7]: More and more aghast grew Ian !
Parsing [sent. 6931 len. 6]: What was to be done ?
Parsing [sent. 6932 len. 6]: What was to be said ?
Parsing [sent. 6933 len. 18]: What was left for a man to do , when a woman laid her soul before him ?
Parsing [sent. 6934 len. 13]: Was there nothing but a lie to save her from bitterest humiliation ?
Parsing [sent. 6935 len. 35]: To refuse any woman was to Ian a hard task ; once he had found it impossible to refuse even where he could not give , and had let a woman take his soul !
Parsing [sent. 6936 len. 8]: Thank God , she took it indeed !
Parsing [sent. 6937 len. 13]: he yielded himself perfectly , and God gave him her in return !
Parsing [sent. 6938 len. 9]: But that was once , and for ever !
Parsing [sent. 6939 len. 7]: It could not be done again !
Parsing [sent. 6940 len. 7]: `` I am very sorry ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6941 len. 18]: he murmured ; and the words and their tone sent a shiver through the heart of Christina .
Parsing [sent. 6942 len. 21]: But now that she had betrayed her secret , the pent up tide of her phantasy rushed to the door .
Parsing [sent. 6943 len. 4]: She was reckless .
Parsing [sent. 6944 len. 33]: Used to everything her own way , knowing nothing of disappointment , a new and ill understood passion dominating her , she let everything go and the torrent sweep her with it .
Parsing [sent. 6945 len. 22]: Passion , like a lovely wild beast , had mastered her , and she never thought of trying to tame it .
Parsing [sent. 6946 len. 4]: It was herself !
Parsing [sent. 6947 len. 15]: there was not enough of her outside the passion to stand up against it !
Parsing [sent. 6948 len. 25]: She began to see the filmy eyed Despair , and had neither experience to deal with herself , nor reticence enough to keep silence .
Parsing [sent. 6949 len. 19]: `` If you speak to me like that , '' she cried , `` my heart will break !
Parsing [sent. 6950 len. 7]: -- Must you go away ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6951 len. 10]: `` Dear Miss Palmer , -- '' faltered Ian .
Parsing [sent. 6952 len. 4]: `` Oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6953 len. 13]: she ejaculated , with a world of bitterness in the protest . ''
Parsing [sent. 6954 len. 8]: -- do let us be calm ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6955 len. 3]: continued Ian .
Parsing [sent. 6956 len. 15]: `` We shall not come to anything if we lose ourselves this way ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6957 len. 11]: The WE and the US gave her a little hope .
Parsing [sent. 6958 len. 8]: `` How can I be calm ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6959 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 6960 len. 8]: `` I am not cold-hearted like you !
Parsing [sent. 6961 len. 18]: -- You are going away , and I shall never see you again to all eternity ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6962 len. 6]: She burst out weeping afresh .
Parsing [sent. 6963 len. 14]: `` Do love me a little before you go , '' she sobbed .
Parsing [sent. 6964 len. 22]: `` You gave me my life once , but that does not make it right to take it from me again !
Parsing [sent. 6965 len. 11]: It only gives you a right to its best ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6966 len. 26]: `` God knows , '' said Ian , `` if my life could serve you , I should count it a small thing to yield !
Parsing [sent. 6967 len. 7]: -- But this is idle talk !
Parsing [sent. 6968 len. 7]: A man must not pretend anything !
Parsing [sent. 6969 len. 7]: We must not be untrue ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6970 len. 9]: She fancied he did not believe in her .
Parsing [sent. 6971 len. 4]: `` I know !
Parsing [sent. 6972 len. 3]: I know !
Parsing [sent. 6973 len. 7]: you may well distrust me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6974 len. 3]: she returned .
Parsing [sent. 6975 len. 9]: `` I have often behaved abominably to you !
Parsing [sent. 6976 len. 7]: But indeed I am true now !
Parsing [sent. 6977 len. 8]: I dare not tell you a lie .
Parsing [sent. 6978 len. 18]: To you I MUST speak the truth , for I love you with my whole soul . ''
Parsing [sent. 6979 len. 4]: Ian stood dumb .
Parsing [sent. 6980 len. 13]: His look of consternation and sadness brought her to herself a little .
Parsing [sent. 6981 len. 7]: `` What have I done ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6982 len. 17]: she cried , and drawing back a pace , stood looking at him , and trembling .
Parsing [sent. 6983 len. 7]: `` I am disgraced for ever !
Parsing [sent. 6984 len. 19]: I have told a man I love him , and he leaves me to the shame of it !
Parsing [sent. 6985 len. 8]: He will not save me from it !
Parsing [sent. 6986 len. 11]: he will not say one word to take it away !
Parsing [sent. 6987 len. 8]: Where is your generosity , Ian ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6988 len. 7]: `` I must be true ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6989 len. 18]: said Ian , speaking as if to himself , and in a voice altogether unlike his own .
Parsing [sent. 6990 len. 7]: `` You will not love me !
Parsing [sent. 6991 len. 4]: You hate me !
Parsing [sent. 6992 len. 4]: You despise me !
Parsing [sent. 6993 len. 7]: But I will not live rejected !
Parsing [sent. 6994 len. 11]: He brushes me like a feather from his coat ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6995 len. 13]: `` Hear me , '' said Ian , trying to recover himself .
Parsing [sent. 6996 len. 13]: `` Do not think me insensible -- '' `` Oh , yes !
Parsing [sent. 6997 len. 4]: I know ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6998 len. 25]: cried Christina yet more bitterly ; '' -- INSENSIBLE TO THE HONOUR _ I _ DO YOU , and all that world of nothing !
Parsing [sent. 6999 len. 6]: -- Pray use your victory !
Parsing [sent. 7000 len. 5]: Lord it over me !
Parsing [sent. 7001 len. 8]: I am the weed under your foot !
Parsing [sent. 7002 len. 8]: I beg you will not spare me !
Parsing [sent. 7003 len. 9]: Speak out what you think of me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7004 len. 5]: Ian took her hand .
Parsing [sent. 7005 len. 18]: It trembled as if she would pull it away , and her eyes flashed an angry fire .
Parsing [sent. 7006 len. 12]: She looked more nearly beautiful than ever he had seen her !
Parsing [sent. 7007 len. 7]: His heart was like to break .
Parsing [sent. 7008 len. 17]: He drew her to the chair , and taking a stool , sat down beside her .
Parsing [sent. 7009 len. 36]: Then , with a voice that gathered strength as he proceeded , he said : -- `` Let me speak to you , Christina Palmer , as in the presence of him who made us !
Parsing [sent. 7010 len. 19]: To pretend I loved you would be easier than to bear the pain of giving you such pain .
Parsing [sent. 7011 len. 35]: Were I selfish enough , I could take much delight in your love ; but I scorn the unmanliness of accepting gold and returning silver : my love is not mine to give . ''
Parsing [sent. 7012 len. 20]: It was some relief to her proud heart to imagine he would have loved her had he been free .
Parsing [sent. 7013 len. 6]: But she did not speak .
Parsing [sent. 7014 len. 42]: `` If I thought , '' pursued Ian , `` that I had , by any behaviour of mine , been to blame for this , -- '' There he stopped , lest he should seem to lay blame on her .
Parsing [sent. 7015 len. 21]: -- `` I think , '' he resumed , `` I could help you if you would listen to me .
Parsing [sent. 7016 len. 30]: Were I in like trouble with you , I would go into my room , and shut the door , and tell my Father in heaven everything about it .
Parsing [sent. 7017 len. 4]: Ah , Christina !
Parsing [sent. 7018 len. 25]: if you knew him , you would not break your heart that a man did not love you just as you loved him . ''
Parsing [sent. 7019 len. 50]: Had not her misery been so great , had she not also done the thing that humbled her before herself , Christina would have been indignant with the man who refused her love and dared speak to her of religion ; but she was now too broken for resentment .
Parsing [sent. 7020 len. 45]: The diamond rain was falling , the sun was shining in his vaporous strength , and the great dome of heaven stood fathomless above the pair ; but to Christina the world was black and blank as the gloomy hut in which they sat .
Parsing [sent. 7021 len. 75]: When first her love blossomed , she saw the world open ; she looked into its heart ; she saw it alive -- saw it burning with that which made the bush alive in the desert of Horeb -- the presence of the living God ; now , the vision was over , the desert was dull and dry , the bush burned no more , the glowing lava had cooled to unsightly stone !
Parsing [sent. 7022 len. 10]: There was no God , nor any man more !
Parsing [sent. 7023 len. 13]: Time had closed and swept the world into the limbo of vanity !
Parsing [sent. 7024 len. 16]: For a time she sat without thought , as it were in a mental sleep .
Parsing [sent. 7025 len. 18]: She opened her eyes , and the blank of creation stared into the very heart of her .
Parsing [sent. 7026 len. 7]: The emptiness and loneliness overpowered her .
Parsing [sent. 7027 len. 29]: Hardly aware of what she was doing , she slid to her knees at Ian 's feet , crying , `` Save me , save me , Ian !
Parsing [sent. 7028 len. 5]: I shall go mad !
Parsing [sent. 7029 len. 3]: Pardon me !
Parsing [sent. 7030 len. 4]: Help me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7031 len. 18]: `` All a man may be to his sister , I am ready to be to you .
Parsing [sent. 7032 len. 18]: I will write to you from Canada ; you can answer me or not as you please .
Parsing [sent. 7033 len. 28]: My heart cries out to me to take you in my arms and comfort you , but I must not ; it would not comfort you . ''
Parsing [sent. 7034 len. 9]: `` You do not despise me , then ?
Parsing [sent. 7035 len. 7]: -- Oh , thank you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7036 len. 4]: `` Despise you !
Parsing [sent. 7037 len. 8]: -- no more than my dead sister !
Parsing [sent. 7038 len. 14]: I would cherish you as I would her were she in like sorrow .
Parsing [sent. 7039 len. 19]: I would die to save you this grief -- except indeed that I hope much from it . ''
Parsing [sent. 7040 len. 16]: `` Forget all about me , '' said Christina , summoning pride to her aid .
Parsing [sent. 7041 len. 7]: `` I will not forget you .
Parsing [sent. 7042 len. 12]: It is impossible , nor would I if I could . ''
Parsing [sent. 7043 len. 15]: `` You forgive me then , and will not think ill of me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7044 len. 5]: `` How forgive trust ?
Parsing [sent. 7045 len. 6]: Is that an offence ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7046 len. 8]: `` I have lost your good opinion !
Parsing [sent. 7047 len. 8]: How could I degrade myself so ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7048 len. 13]: `` On the contrary , you are fast gaining iuy good opinion .
Parsing [sent. 7049 len. 10]: You have begun to be a true woman ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7050 len. 30]: `` What if it should be only for -- '' `` Whatever it may have been for , now you have tasted truth you will not turn back ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7051 len. 24]: `` Now I know you do not care for me , I fear I shall soon sink back into my old self ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7052 len. 20]: `` I do care for you , Christina , and you will not sink back into your old self .
Parsing [sent. 7053 len. 29]: God means you to be a strong , good woman -- able , with the help he will give you , to bear grief in a great-hearted fashion .
Parsing [sent. 7054 len. 31]: Believe me , you and I may come nearer each other in the ages before us by being both true , than is possible in any other way whatever . ''
Parsing [sent. 7055 len. 15]: `` I am miserable at the thought of what you must think of me !
Parsing [sent. 7056 len. 15]: Everybody would say I had done a shameless thing in confessing my love ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7057 len. 13]: `` I am not in the way of thinking as everybody thinks .
Parsing [sent. 7058 len. 15]: There is little justice , and less sympathy , to be had from everybody .
Parsing [sent. 7059 len. 14]: I would think and judge and feel as the one , my Master .
Parsing [sent. 7060 len. 9]: Be sure you are safe with me . ''
Parsing [sent. 7061 len. 8]: `` You will not tell anybody ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7062 len. 7]: `` You must trust me . ''
Parsing [sent. 7063 len. 6]: `` I beg your pardon !
Parsing [sent. 7064 len. 6]: I have offended you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7065 len. 6]: `` Not in the least .
Parsing [sent. 7066 len. 9]: But I will bind myself by no promises .
Parsing [sent. 7067 len. 22]: I am bound already to be as careful over you as if you were the daughter of my father and mother .
Parsing [sent. 7068 len. 17]: Your confession , instead of putting you in my power , makes me your servant . ''
Parsing [sent. 7069 len. 7]: By this time Christina was calm .
Parsing [sent. 7070 len. 21]: There was a great load on her heart , but somehow she was aware of the possibility of carrying it .
Parsing [sent. 7071 len. 32]: She looked up gratefully in Ian 's face , already beginning to feel for him a reverence which made it easier to forego the right to put her arms round him .
Parsing [sent. 7072 len. 26]: And therewith awoke in her the first movement of divine relationship -- rose the first heave of the child-heart toward the source of its being .
Parsing [sent. 7073 len. 8]: It appeared in the form of resistance .
Parsing [sent. 7074 len. 13]: Complaint against God is far nearer to God than indifference about him .
Parsing [sent. 7075 len. 31]: `` Ian Macruadh , '' said Christina solemnly , and she looked him in the eyes as she said it , `` how can you believe there is a God ?
Parsing [sent. 7076 len. 18]: If there were , would he allow such a dreadful thing to befall one of his creatures ?
Parsing [sent. 7077 len. 6]: How am I to blame ?
Parsing [sent. 7078 len. 7]: I could not help it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7079 len. 13]: `` I see in it his truth and goodness toward his child .
Parsing [sent. 7080 len. 8]: And he will let you see it .
Parsing [sent. 7081 len. 9]: The thing is between him and you . ''
Parsing [sent. 7082 len. 22]: `` It will be hard to convince me it is either good or loving to make anyone suffer like this ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7083 len. 22]: protested Christina , her hand unconsciously pressed on her heart ; '' -- and all the disgrace of it too ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7084 len. 4]: she added bitterly .
Parsing [sent. 7085 len. 14]: `` I will not allow there is any disgrace , '' returned Ian .
Parsing [sent. 7086 len. 15]: `` But I will not try to con vince you of anything about God .
Parsing [sent. 7087 len. 4]: I can not .
Parsing [sent. 7088 len. 5]: You must know him .
Parsing [sent. 7089 len. 12]: I only say I believe in him with all my heart .
Parsing [sent. 7090 len. 35]: You must ask him to explain himself to you , and not take it for granted , because he has done what you do not like , that he has done you a wrong .
Parsing [sent. 7091 len. 25]: Whether you seek him or not , he will do you justice ; but he can not explain himself except you seek him . ''
Parsing [sent. 7092 len. 6]: `` I think I understand .
Parsing [sent. 7093 len. 10]: Believe me , I am willing to understand . ''
Parsing [sent. 7094 len. 8]: A few long seconds of silence followed .
Parsing [sent. 7095 len. 6]: Christina came a little nearer .
Parsing [sent. 7096 len. 7]: She was still on her knees .
Parsing [sent. 7097 len. 20]: `` Will you kiss me once , '' she said , `` as you would a little child ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7098 len. 8]: `` In the name of God ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7099 len. 11]: answered lan , and stooping kissed her gently and tenderly .
Parsing [sent. 7100 len. 5]: `` Thank you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7101 len. 20]: she said ; '' -- and now the rain is over , let us join Mercy and the chief .
Parsing [sent. 7102 len. 10]: I hope they have not got very wet ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7103 len. 9]: `` Alister will have taken care of that .
Parsing [sent. 7104 len. 9]: There is plenty of shelter about here . ''
Parsing [sent. 7105 len. 36]: They left the cottage , drew the door close , and through the heather , sparkling with a thousand rain-drops , the sun shining hotter than ever through the rain-mist , went up the hill .
Parsing [sent. 7106 len. 32]: They found the other pair sheltered by the great stone , which was not only a shadow from the heat , but sloped sufficiently to be a covert from the rain .
Parsing [sent. 7107 len. 17]: They did not know it had ceased ; perhaps they did not know it had rained .
Parsing [sent. 7108 len. 46]: On a fine morning of the following week , the emigrants began the first stage of their long journey ; the women in two carts , with their small impedimenta , the men walking -- Ian with them , a stout stick in his hand .
Parsing [sent. 7109 len. 7]: They were to sail from Greenock .
Parsing [sent. 7110 len. 14]: Ian and Christina met several times before he left , but never alone .
Parsing [sent. 7111 len. 30]: No conference of any kind , not even of eyes , had been sought by Christina , and Ian had resolved to say nothing more until he reached Canada .
Parsing [sent. 7112 len. 45]: Thence he would write things which pen and ink would say better and carry nearer home than could speech ; and by that time too the first keenness of her pain would have dulled , and left her mind more capable of receiving them .
Parsing [sent. 7113 len. 12]: He was greatly pleased with the gentle calm of her behaviour .
Parsing [sent. 7114 len. 11]: No one else could have seen any difference toward himself .
Parsing [sent. 7115 len. 22]: He read in her carriage that of a child who had made a mistake , and was humbled , not vexed .
Parsing [sent. 7116 len. 22]: Her mother noted that her cheek was pale , and that she seemed thoughtful ; but farther she did not penetrate .
Parsing [sent. 7117 len. 14]: To Ian it was plain that she had set herself to be reasonable .
Parsing [sent. 7118 len. 5]: CHAPTER VI LOVE GLOOMING .
Parsing [sent. 7119 len. 18]: Ian , the light of his mother 's eyes , was gone , and she felt forsaken .
Parsing [sent. 7120 len. 26]: Alister was too much occupied with Mercy to feel his departure as on former occasions , yet he missed him every hour of the day .
Parsing [sent. 7121 len. 23]: Mercy and he met , but not for some time in open company , as Christina refused to go near the cottage .
Parsing [sent. 7122 len. 7]: Things were ripening to a change .
Parsing [sent. 7123 len. 33]: Alister 's occupation with Mercy , however , was far from absorption ; the moment Ian was gone , he increased his attention to his mother , feeling she had but him .
Parsing [sent. 7124 len. 12]: But his mother was not quite the same to him now .
Parsing [sent. 7125 len. 30]: At times she was even more tender ; at other times she seemed to hold him away from her , as one with whom she was not in sympathy .
Parsing [sent. 7126 len. 42]: The fear awoke in him that she might so speak to some one of the Palmers as to raise an insuperable barrier between the families ; and this fear made him resolve to come at once to an understanding with Mercy .
Parsing [sent. 7127 len. 58]: The resulting difficulties might be great ; he felt keenly the possible alternative of his loss of Mercy , or Mercy 's loss of her family ; but the fact that he loved her gave him a right to tell her so , and made it his duty to lay before her the probability of an obstacle .
Parsing [sent. 7128 len. 35]: That his mother did not like the alliance had to be braved , for a man must leave father and mother and cleave to his wife -- a saying commonly by male presumption inverted .
Parsing [sent. 7129 len. 29]: Mercy 's love he believed such that she would , without a thought , leave the luxury of her father 's house for the mere plenty of his .
Parsing [sent. 7130 len. 22]: That it would not be to descend but to rise in the true social scale he would leave her to discover .
Parsing [sent. 7131 len. 52]: Had he known what Mr. Palmer was , and how his money had been made , he would neither have sought nor accepted his acquaintance , and it would no more have been possible to fall in love with one of his family than to covet one of his fine horses .
Parsing [sent. 7132 len. 22]: But that which might , could , would , or should have been , affected in no way that which was .
Parsing [sent. 7133 len. 42]: He had entered in ignorance , by the will of God , into certain relations with `` the young woman , '' as his mother called her , and those relations had to be followed to their natural and righteous end .
Parsing [sent. 7134 len. 61]: Talking together over possibilities , Mr. Peregrine Palmer had agreed with his wife that , Mercy being so far from a beauty , it might not be such a bad match , would not at least be one to be ashamed of , if she did marry the impoverished chief of a highland clan with a baronetcy in his pocket .
Parsing [sent. 7135 len. 39]: Having bought the land cheap , he could afford to let a part , perhaps even the whole of it , go back with his daughter , thus restoring to its former position an ancient and honourable family .
Parsing [sent. 7136 len. 35]: The husband of his younger daughter would then be head of one of the very few highland families yet in possession of their ancestral acres -- a distinction he would owe to Peregrine Palmer !
Parsing [sent. 7137 len. 15]: It was a pleasant thought to the kindly , consequential , common little man .
Parsing [sent. 7138 len. 21]: Mrs. Palmer , therefore , when the chief called upon her , received him with more than her previous cordiality .
Parsing [sent. 7139 len. 30]: His mother would have been glad to see him return from his call somewhat dejected ; he entered so radiant and handsome , that her heart sank within her .
Parsing [sent. 7140 len. 37]: Was she actually on the point of being allied through the child of her bosom to a distiller and brewer -- a man who had grown rich on the ruin of thousands of his fellow countrymen ?
Parsing [sent. 7141 len. 11]: To what depths might not the most ancient family sink !
Parsing [sent. 7142 len. 21]: For any poverty , she said to herself , she was prepared -- but how was she to endure disgrace !
Parsing [sent. 7143 len. 21]: Alas for the clan , whose history was about to cease -- smothered in the defiling garment of ill-gotten wealth !
Parsing [sent. 7144 len. 8]: Miserable , humiliating close to ancient story !
Parsing [sent. 7145 len. 44]: She had no doubt as to her son 's intention , although he had said nothing ; she KNEW that his refusal of dower would be his plea in justification ; but would that deliver them from the degrading approval of the world ?
Parsing [sent. 7146 len. 30]: How many , if they ever heard of it , would believe that the poor , high-souled Macruadh declined to receive a single hundred from his father-in-law 's affluence !
Parsing [sent. 7147 len. 25]: That he took his daughter poor as she was born -- his one stipulation that she should be clean from her father 's mud !
Parsing [sent. 7148 len. 29]: For one to whom there would even be a chance of stating the truth of the matter , a hundred would say , `` That 's your plan !
Parsing [sent. 7149 len. 8]: The only salvation for your shattered houses !
Parsing [sent. 7150 len. 28]: Point them up well with the bird-lime of the brewer , the quack , or the money-lender , and they 'll last till doom ` sday ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7151 len. 6]: Thus bitterly spoke the mother .
Parsing [sent. 7152 len. 20]: She brooded and scorned , raged inwardly , and took to herself dishonour , until evidently she was wasting .
Parsing [sent. 7153 len. 19]: The chief 's heart was troubled ; could it be that she doubted his strength to resist temptation ?
Parsing [sent. 7154 len. 11]: He must make haste and have the whole thing settled !
Parsing [sent. 7155 len. 12]: And first of all speak definitely to Mercy on the matter !
Parsing [sent. 7156 len. 22]: He had appointed to meet her the same evening , and went long before the hour to watch for her appearing .
Parsing [sent. 7157 len. 33]: He climbed the hill , and lay down in the heather whence he could see the door of the New House , and Mercy the moment she should come out of it .
Parsing [sent. 7158 len. 16]: He lay there till the sun was down , and the stars began to appear .
Parsing [sent. 7159 len. 28]: At length -- and even then it was many minutes to the time -- he saw the door open , and Mercy walk slowly to the gate .
Parsing [sent. 7160 len. 8]: He rose and went down the hill .
Parsing [sent. 7161 len. 21]: She saw him , watched him descending , and the moment he reached the road , went to meet him .
Parsing [sent. 7162 len. 18]: They walked slowly down the road , without a word spoken , until they felt themselves alone .
Parsing [sent. 7163 len. 7]: `` You look so lovely ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7164 len. 4]: said the chief .
Parsing [sent. 7165 len. 9]: `` In the twilight , I suppose ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7166 len. 3]: said Mercy .
Parsing [sent. 7167 len. 23]: `` Perhaps ; you are a creature of the twilight , or the night rather , with your great black eyes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7168 len. 12]: `` I do n't like you to speak to me so !
Parsing [sent. 7169 len. 5]: You never did before !
Parsing [sent. 7170 len. 7]: You know I am not lovely !
Parsing [sent. 7171 len. 6]: I am very plain ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7172 len. 6]: She was evidently not pleased .
Parsing [sent. 7173 len. 12]: `` What have I done to vex you , Mercy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7174 len. 3]: he rejoined .
Parsing [sent. 7175 len. 12]: `` Why should you mind my saying what is true ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7176 len. 13]: She bit her lip , and could hardly speak to answer him .
Parsing [sent. 7177 len. 32]: Often in London she had been morally sickened by the false rubbish talked to her sister , and had boasted to herself that the chief had never paid her a compliment .
Parsing [sent. 7178 len. 6]: Now he had done it !
Parsing [sent. 7179 len. 8]: She took her hand from his arm .
Parsing [sent. 7180 len. 9]: `` I think I will go home ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7181 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 7182 len. 7]: Alister stopped and turned to her .
Parsing [sent. 7183 len. 25]: The last gleam of the west was reflected from her eyes , and all the sadness of the fading light seemed gathered into them .
Parsing [sent. 7184 len. 5]: `` My child ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7185 len. 24]: he said , all that was fatherly in the chief rising at the sight , `` who has been making you unhappy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7186 len. 13]: `` You , '' she answered , looking him in the face .
Parsing [sent. 7187 len. 3]: `` How ?
Parsing [sent. 7188 len. 6]: I do not understand ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7189 len. 8]: he returned , gazing at her bewildered .
Parsing [sent. 7190 len. 28]: `` You have just paid me a compliment -- a thing you never did before -- a thing I never heard before from any but a fool !
Parsing [sent. 7191 len. 8]: How could you say I was beautiful !
Parsing [sent. 7192 len. 7]: You know I am not beautiful !
Parsing [sent. 7193 len. 16]: It breaks my heart to think you could say what you did n't believe ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7194 len. 4]: `` Mercy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7195 len. 52]: answered the chief , `` if I said you were beautiful , and to my eyes you were not , it would yet be true ; for to my heart , which sees deeper than my eyes , you are more beautiful than any other ever was or ever will be .
Parsing [sent. 7196 len. 28]: I know you are not beautiful in the world 's meaning , but you are very lovely -- and it was lovely I said you were ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7197 len. 7]: `` Lovely because you love me ?
Parsing [sent. 7198 len. 7]: Is that what you meant ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7199 len. 7]: `` Yes , that and more .
Parsing [sent. 7200 len. 17]: Your eyes are beautiful , and your hair is beautiful , and your expression is lovely .
Parsing [sent. 7201 len. 34]: But I am not flattering you -- I am not even paying you compliments , for those things are not yours ; God made them , and has given them to me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7202 len. 16]: She put her hand in his arm again , and there was no more love-making .
Parsing [sent. 7203 len. 35]: `` But Mercy , '' said the chief , when they had walked some distance without speaking , `` do you think you could live here always , and never see London again ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7204 len. 12]: `` I would not care if London were scratched out . ''
Parsing [sent. 7205 len. 13]: `` Could you be content to be a farmer 's wife ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7206 len. 17]: `` If he was a very good farmer , '' she answered , looking up archly .
Parsing [sent. 7207 len. 16]: `` Am I a good enough farmer , then , to serve your turn ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7208 len. 10]: `` Good enough if I were ten times better .
Parsing [sent. 7209 len. 9]: Do you really mean it , Macruadh ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7210 len. 6]: `` With all my heart .
Parsing [sent. 7211 len. 12]: Only there is one thing I am very anxious about . ''
Parsing [sent. 7212 len. 6]: `` What is that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7213 len. 10]: `` How your father will take my condition . ''
Parsing [sent. 7214 len. 23]: `` He will allow , I think , that it is good enough for me -- and more than I deserve . ''
Parsing [sent. 7215 len. 20]: `` That is not what I mean ; it is that I have a certain condition to make . ''
Parsing [sent. 7216 len. 8]: `` Else you wo n't marry me ?
Parsing [sent. 7217 len. 4]: That seems strange !
Parsing [sent. 7218 len. 13]: Of course I will do anything you would wish me to do !
Parsing [sent. 7219 len. 4]: A condition ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7220 len. 14]: she repeated , ponderingly , with just a little dissatisfaction in the tone .
Parsing [sent. 7221 len. 7]: Alister wondered she was not angry .
Parsing [sent. 7222 len. 11]: But she trusted him too well to take offence readily .
Parsing [sent. 7223 len. 12]: `` Yes , '' he rejoined , `` a real condition !
Parsing [sent. 7224 len. 23]: Terms belong naturally to the giver , not the petitioner ; I hope with all my heart it will not offend him .
Parsing [sent. 7225 len. 10]: It will not offend you , I think . ''
Parsing [sent. 7226 len. 25]: `` Let me hear your condition , '' said Mercy , looking at him curiously , her honest eyes shining in the faint light .
Parsing [sent. 7227 len. 25]: `` I want him to let me take you just as you are , without a shilling of his money to spoil the gift .
Parsing [sent. 7228 len. 9]: I want you in and for yourself . ''
Parsing [sent. 7229 len. 20]: `` I dare not think you one who would rather not be obliged to his wife for anything ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7230 len. 3]: said Mercy .
Parsing [sent. 7231 len. 8]: `` That can not be it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7232 len. 9]: She spoke with just a shadow of displeasure .
Parsing [sent. 7233 len. 5]: He did not answer .
Parsing [sent. 7234 len. 20]: He was in great dread of hurting her , and his plain reason could not fail to hurt her .
Parsing [sent. 7235 len. 31]: `` Well , '' she resumed , as he did not reply , `` there are fathers , I daresay , who would not count that a hard condition ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7236 len. 19]: `` Of course your father will not like the idea of your marrying so poor a man ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7237 len. 20]: `` If he should insist on your having something with me , you will not refuse , will you ?
Parsing [sent. 7238 len. 7]: Why should you mind it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7239 len. 4]: Alister was silent .
Parsing [sent. 7240 len. 9]: The thing had already begun to grow dreadful !
Parsing [sent. 7241 len. 8]: How could he tell her his reasons !
Parsing [sent. 7242 len. 7]: Was it necessary to tell her ?
Parsing [sent. 7243 len. 17]: If he had to explain , it must be to her father , not to her !
Parsing [sent. 7244 len. 19]: How , until absolutely compelled , reveal the horrible fact that her father was despised by her lover !
Parsing [sent. 7245 len. 11]: She might believe it her part to refuse such love !
Parsing [sent. 7246 len. 8]: He trembled lest she should urge him .
Parsing [sent. 7247 len. 16]: But Mercy , thinking she had been very bold already , also held her peace .
Parsing [sent. 7248 len. 33]: They tried to talk about other things , but with little success , and when they parted , it was with a sense on both sides that something had got between them .
Parsing [sent. 7249 len. 19]: The night through Mercy hardly slept for trying to discover what his aversion to her dowry might mean .
Parsing [sent. 7250 len. 25]: No princedom was worth contrasting with poverty and her farmer-chief , but why should not his love be able to carry her few thousands ?
Parsing [sent. 7251 len. 20]: It was impossible his great soul should grudge his wife 's superiority in the one poor trifle of money !
Parsing [sent. 7252 len. 9]: Was not the whole family superior to money !
Parsing [sent. 7253 len. 12]: Had she , alas , been too confident in their greatness ?
Parsing [sent. 7254 len. 17]: Must she be brought to confess that their grand ways had their little heart of pride ?
Parsing [sent. 7255 len. 13]: Did they not regard themselves as the ancient aristocracy of the country !
Parsing [sent. 7256 len. 6]: Yes , it must be !
Parsing [sent. 7257 len. 11]: The chief despised the origin of her father 's riches !
Parsing [sent. 7258 len. 29]: But , although so far in the direction of the fact , she had no suspicion of anything more than landed pride looking down upon manufacture and trade .
Parsing [sent. 7259 len. 15]: She suspected no moral root of even a share in the chief 's difficulty .
Parsing [sent. 7260 len. 6]: Naturally , she was offended .
Parsing [sent. 7261 len. 16]: How differently Christina would have met the least hint of a CONDITION , she thought .
Parsing [sent. 7262 len. 12]: She had been too ready to show and confess her love !
Parsing [sent. 7263 len. 14]: Had she stood off a little , she might have escaped this humiliation !
Parsing [sent. 7264 len. 7]: But would that have been honest ?
Parsing [sent. 7265 len. 9]: Must she not first of all be true ?
Parsing [sent. 7266 len. 13]: Was the chief , whatever his pride , capable of being ungenerous ?
Parsing [sent. 7267 len. 11]: Questions like these kept coming and going throughout the night .
Parsing [sent. 7268 len. 12]: Hither and thither went her thoughts , refusing to be controlled .
Parsing [sent. 7269 len. 15]: The morning came , the sun rose , and she could not find rest .
Parsing [sent. 7270 len. 56]: She had come to see how ideally delightful it was just to wait God 's will of love , yet , in this her first trouble , she actually forgot to think of God , never asked him to look after the thing for her , never said , `` Thy will be done ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7271 len. 24]: And when at length weariness overpowered her , fell asleep like a heathen , without a word from her heart to the heart .
Parsing [sent. 7272 len. 5]: Alister missed Ian sorely .
Parsing [sent. 7273 len. 14]: He prayed to God , but was too troubled to feel him near .
Parsing [sent. 7274 len. 15]: Trouble imagined may seem easy to meet ; trouble actual is quite another thing !
Parsing [sent. 7275 len. 26]: His mother , perhaps , was to have her desire ; Mercy , perhaps , would not marry a man who disapproved of her family !
Parsing [sent. 7276 len. 11]: Between them already was what could not be talked about !
Parsing [sent. 7277 len. 10]: He could not set free his heart to her !
Parsing [sent. 7278 len. 29]: When Mercy woke , the old love was awake also ; let Alister 's reason be what it might , it was not for her to resent it !
Parsing [sent. 7279 len. 23]: The life he led was so much grander than a life spent in making money , that he must feel himself superior !
Parsing [sent. 7280 len. 26]: Throned in the hearts , and influencing the characters of men , was he not in a far nobler position than money could give him ?
Parsing [sent. 7281 len. 14]: From her night of doubt and bitterness Mercy issued more loving and humble .
Parsing [sent. 7282 len. 18]: What should she be now , she said to herself , if Alister had not taught her ?
Parsing [sent. 7283 len. 12]: He had been good to her as never father or brother !
Parsing [sent. 7284 len. 5]: She would trust him !
Parsing [sent. 7285 len. 6]: She would believe him right !
Parsing [sent. 7286 len. 6]: Had he hurt her pride ?
Parsing [sent. 7287 len. 9]: It was well her pride should be hurt !
Parsing [sent. 7288 len. 6]: Her mind was at rest .
Parsing [sent. 7289 len. 16]: But Alister must continue in pain and dread until he had spoken to her father .
Parsing [sent. 7290 len. 21]: Knowing then the worst , he might use argument with Mercy ; the moment for that was not yet come !
Parsing [sent. 7291 len. 19]: If he consented that his daughter should leave him undowered , an explanation with Mercy might be postponed .
Parsing [sent. 7292 len. 55]: When the honour of her husband was more to her than the false credit of her family , when she had had time to understand principles which , born and brought up as she had been , she might not yet be able to see into , then it would be time to explain !
Parsing [sent. 7293 len. 13]: One with him , she would see things as he saw them !
Parsing [sent. 7294 len. 11]: Till her father came , he would avoid the subject !
Parsing [sent. 7295 len. 40]: All the morning he was busy in the cornyard -- with his hands in preparing new stances for ricks , with his heart in try ing to content himself beforehand with whatever fate the Lord might intend for him .
Parsing [sent. 7296 len. 14]: As yet he was more of a Christian philosopher than a philosophical Christian .
Parsing [sent. 7297 len. 47]: The thing most disappointing to him he would treat as the will of God for him , and try to make up his mind to it , persuading himself it was the right and best thing -- as if he knew it the will of God .
Parsing [sent. 7298 len. 29]: He was thus working in the region of supposition , and not of revealed duty ; in his own imagination , and not in the will of God .
Parsing [sent. 7299 len. 21]: If this should not prove the will of God concerning him , then he was spending his strength for nought .
Parsing [sent. 7300 len. 48]: There is something in the very presence and actuality of a thing to make one able to bear it ; but a man may weaken himself for bearing what God intends him to bear , by trying to bear what God does not intend him to bear .
Parsing [sent. 7301 len. 25]: The chief was forestalling the morrow like an unbeliever -- not without some moral advantage , I dare say , but with spiritual loss .
Parsing [sent. 7302 len. 12]: We have no right to school ourselves to an imaginary duty .
Parsing [sent. 7303 len. 25]: When we do not know , then what he lays upon us is NOT TO KNOW , and to be content not to know .
Parsing [sent. 7304 len. 23]: The philosopher is he who lives in the thought of things , the Christian is he who lives in the things themselves .
Parsing [sent. 7305 len. 34]: The philosopher occupies himself with Grod 's decree , the Christian with God 's will ; the philosopher with what God may intend , the Christian with what God wants HIM TO DO .
Parsing [sent. 7306 len. 11]: The laird looked up and there were the young ladies !
Parsing [sent. 7307 len. 16]: It was the first time Christina had come nigh the cottage since Ian 's departure .
Parsing [sent. 7308 len. 21]: `` Can you tell me , Macruadh , '' she said , `` what makes Mrs. Conal so spiteful always ?
Parsing [sent. 7309 len. 21]: When we bade her good morning a few minutes ago , she overwhelmed us with a torrent of abuse ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7310 len. 10]: `` How did you know it was abuse ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7311 len. 17]: `` We understand enough of Gaelic to know it was not exactly blessing us she was .
Parsing [sent. 7312 len. 14]: It is not necessary to know cat-language to distinguish between purring and spitting !
Parsing [sent. 7313 len. 6]: What harm have we done ?
Parsing [sent. 7314 len. 17]: Her voice was fierce , and her eyes were like two live peats flaming at us !
Parsing [sent. 7315 len. 6]: Do speak to her . ''
Parsing [sent. 7316 len. 9]: `` It would be of no use ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7317 len. 10]: `` Where 's the good of being chief then ?
Parsing [sent. 7318 len. 24]: I do n't ask you to make the old woman civil , but I think you might keep her from insulting your friends !
Parsing [sent. 7319 len. 10]: I begin to think your chiefdom a sham ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7320 len. 14]: `` I doubt indeed if it reaches to the tongues of the clan !
Parsing [sent. 7321 len. 9]: But let us go and tell my mother .
Parsing [sent. 7322 len. 11]: She may be able to do something with her ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7323 len. 12]: Christina went into the cottage ; the chief drew Mercy back .
Parsing [sent. 7324 len. 25]: `` What do you think the first duty of married people , Mercy -- to each other , I mean , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 7325 len. 12]: `` To be always what they look , '' answered Mercy .
Parsing [sent. 7326 len. 8]: `` Yes , but I mean actively .
Parsing [sent. 7327 len. 13]: What is it their first duty to do towards each other ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7328 len. 10]: `` I ca n't answer that without thinking . ''
Parsing [sent. 7329 len. 17]: `` Is it not each to help the other to do the will of God ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7330 len. 15]: `` I would say YES if I were sure I really meant it . ''
Parsing [sent. 7331 len. 9]: `` You will mean it one day . ''
Parsing [sent. 7332 len. 10]: `` Are you sure God will teach me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7333 len. 14]: `` I think he cares more to do that than anything else . ''
Parsing [sent. 7334 len. 8]: `` More than to save us ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7335 len. 15]: `` What is saving but taking us out of the dark into the light ?
Parsing [sent. 7336 len. 14]: There is no salvation but to know God and grow like him . ''
Parsing [sent. 7337 len. 6]: CHAPTER VII A GENEROUS DOWRY .
Parsing [sent. 7338 len. 23]: The only hope of the chief 's mother was in what the girl 's father might say to her son 's proposal .
Parsing [sent. 7339 len. 21]: Would not his pride revolt against giving his daughter to a man who would not receive his blessing in money ?
Parsing [sent. 7340 len. 14]: Mr. Peregrine Palmer arrived , and the next day Alister called upon him .
Parsing [sent. 7341 len. 19]: Not unprepared for the proposal of the chief , Mercy 's father had nothing to urge against it .
Parsing [sent. 7342 len. 20]: Her suitor 's name was almost an historical one , for it stood high in the home-annals of Scotland .
Parsing [sent. 7343 len. 49]: And the new laird , who had always a vague sense of injury in the lack of an illustrious pedigree of his own to send forward , was not un willing that a man more justly treated than himself should supply the SOLATIUM to his daughter 's children .
Parsing [sent. 7344 len. 16]: He received the Macruadh , therefore , if a little pompously , yet with kindness .
Parsing [sent. 7345 len. 13]: And the moment they were seated Alister laid his request before him .
Parsing [sent. 7346 len. 20]: `` Mr. Palmer , '' he said , `` I come to ask the hand of your daughter Mercy .
Parsing [sent. 7347 len. 21]: I have not much beyond myself to offer her , but I can tell you precisely what there is . ''
Parsing [sent. 7348 len. 10]: Mr. Peregrine Palmer sat for a moment looking important .
Parsing [sent. 7349 len. 11]: He seemed to see much to ponder in the proposal .
Parsing [sent. 7350 len. 39]: `` Well , Macruadh , '' he said at length , hesitating with hum and with haw , `` the thing is -- well , to speak the truth , you take me a good deal by surprise !
Parsing [sent. 7351 len. 13]: I do not know how the thing may appear to Mrs. Palmer .
Parsing [sent. 7352 len. 25]: And then the girl herself , you will allow , ought , in a free country , to have a word in the matter !
Parsing [sent. 7353 len. 27]: WE give our girls absolute liberty ; their own hearts must guide them -- that is , where there is no serious exception to be taken .
Parsing [sent. 7354 len. 14]: Honestly , it is not the kind of match we should have chosen !
Parsing [sent. 7355 len. 46]: It is not as if things were with you now as once , when the land was all your own , and -- and -- you -- pardon me , I am a father -- did not have to work with your own hands ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7356 len. 82]: Had he been there on any other errand the chief would have stated his opinion that it was degrading to a man to draw income from anything he would count it degrading to put his own hand to ; but there was so much he might be compelled to say to the displeasure of Mr. Palmer while asking of him the greatest gift he had to bestow , that he would say nothing unpalatable which he was not compelled to say .
Parsing [sent. 7357 len. 31]: `` My ancestors , '' he answered , willing to give the objection a pleasant turn , `` would certainly have preferred helping themselves to the produce of lowland fields !
Parsing [sent. 7358 len. 20]: My great-great-grandfather , scorning to ask any man for his daughter , carried her off without a word ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7359 len. 17]: I am glad the peculiarity has not shown itself hereditary , '' said Mr. Palmer laughing .
Parsing [sent. 7360 len. 21]: `` But if I have little to offer , I expect nothing with her , '' said the chief abruptly .
Parsing [sent. 7361 len. 7]: `` I want only herself ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7362 len. 8]: `` A very loverly mode of speaking !
Parsing [sent. 7363 len. 27]: But it is needless to say no daughter of mine shall leave me without a certainty , one way or the other , of suitable maintenance .
Parsing [sent. 7364 len. 22]: You know the old proverb , Macruadh , -- ` When poverty comes in at the door , ' -- ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7365 len. 16]: `` There is hardly a question of poverty in the sense the proverb intends ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7366 len. 5]: answered the chief smiling .
Parsing [sent. 7367 len. 4]: `` Of course !
Parsing [sent. 7368 len. 3]: Of course !
Parsing [sent. 7369 len. 16]: At the same time you can not keep the wolf too far from the door .
Parsing [sent. 7370 len. 24]: I would not , for my part , care to say I had given my daughter to a poor farmer in the north .
Parsing [sent. 7371 len. 15]: Two men , it is , I believe , you employ , Macruadh ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7372 len. 7]: The chief answered with a nod .
Parsing [sent. 7373 len. 49]: `` I have other daughters to settle -- not to mention my sons , '' pursued the great little man , '' -- but -- but I will find a time to talk the matter over with Mrs. Palmer , and see what I can do for you .
Parsing [sent. 7374 len. 22]: Meanwhile you may reckon you have a friend at court ; all I have seen makes me judge well of you .
Parsing [sent. 7375 len. 36]: Where we do not think alike , I can yet say for you that your faults lean to virtue 's side , and are such as my daughter at least will be no loser by .
Parsing [sent. 7376 len. 6]: Good morning , Macruadh . ''
Parsing [sent. 7377 len. 27]: Mr. Peregrine Palmer rose ; and the chief , perplexed and indignant , but anxious not to prejudice , his very doubtful cause , rose also .
Parsing [sent. 7378 len. 13]: `` You scarcely understand me , Mr. Palmer , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 7379 len. 31]: `` On the possibility of being honoured with your daughter 's hand , you must allow me to say distinctly beforehand , that I must decline receiving anything with her .
Parsing [sent. 7380 len. 12]: When will you allow me to wait upon you again ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7381 len. 5]: `` I will write .
Parsing [sent. 7382 len. 4]: Good morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 7383 len. 15]: The interview was certainly not much to the assuagement of the chief 's anxiety .
Parsing [sent. 7384 len. 43]: He went home with the feeling that he had submitted to be patronized , almost insulted by a paltry fellow whose consequence rested on his ill-made money -- a man who owed everything to a false and degrading appetite in his neighbours !
Parsing [sent. 7385 len. 23]: Nothing could have made him put up with him but the love of Mercy , his dove in a crow 's nest !
Parsing [sent. 7386 len. 14]: But it would be all in vain , for he could not lie !
Parsing [sent. 7387 len. 30]: Truth , indeed , if not less of a virtue , was less of a heroism in the chief than in most men , for he COULD NOT lie .
Parsing [sent. 7388 len. 31]: Had he been tempted to try , he would have reddened , stammered , broken down , with the full shame , and none of the success of a falsehood .
Parsing [sent. 7389 len. 20]: For a week , he heard nothing ; there seemed small anxiety to welcome him into the Palmer family !
Parsing [sent. 7390 len. 5]: Then came a letter .
Parsing [sent. 7391 len. 34]: It implied , almost said that some difficulty had been felt as to his reception by EVERY member of the family -- which the chief must himself see to have been only natural !
Parsing [sent. 7392 len. 83]: But while money was of no con sequence to Mr. Palmer , it was of the greatest consequence that his daughter should seem to make a good match ; therefore , as only in respect of POSITION was the alliance objectionable , he had concluded to set that right , and in giving him his daughter , to restore the chief 's family to its former dignity , by making over to him the Clanruadh property now in his possession by purchase .
Parsing [sent. 7393 len. 26]: While he thus did his duty by his daughter , he hoped the Macruadh would accept the arrangement as a mark of esteem for himself .
Parsing [sent. 7394 len. 55]: Two conditions only he would make -- the first , that , as long as he lived , the shooting should be Mr. Palmer 's , to use or to let , and should extend over the whole estate ; the second , that the chief should assume the baronetcy which belonged to him .
Parsing [sent. 7395 len. 23]: My reader will regard the proposition as not ungenerous , however much the money value of the land lay in the shooting .
Parsing [sent. 7396 len. 17]: As Alister took leave of his mother for the night , he gave her the letter .
Parsing [sent. 7397 len. 34]: She took it , read it slowly , laughed angrily , smiled scornfully , wept bitterly , crushed it in her hand , and walked up to her room with her head high .
Parsing [sent. 7398 len. 20]: All the time she was preparing for her bed , she was talking in her spirit with her husband .
Parsing [sent. 7399 len. 35]: When she lay down she became a mere prey to her own thoughts , and was pulled , and torn , and hurt by them for hours ere she set herself to rule them .
Parsing [sent. 7400 len. 12]: For the first time in her life she distrusted her son .
Parsing [sent. 7401 len. 9]: She did not know what he would do !
Parsing [sent. 7402 len. 10]: The temptation would surely be too strong for him !
Parsing [sent. 7403 len. 44]: Two good things were set over against one evil thing -- an evil thing , however , with which nobody would associate blame , an evil thing which would raise him high in the respect of everyone whose respect was not worth having !
Parsing [sent. 7404 len. 30]: -- the woman he loved and the land of his ancestors on the one side , and only the money that bought the land for him on the other !
Parsing [sent. 7405 len. 6]: -- would he hold out ?
Parsing [sent. 7406 len. 13]: He must take the three together , or have none of them !
Parsing [sent. 7407 len. 9]: Her fear for him grew and possessed her .
Parsing [sent. 7408 len. 6]: She grew cold as death .
Parsing [sent. 7409 len. 15]: Why did he give her the letter , and go without saying a word ?
Parsing [sent. 7410 len. 9]: She knew well the arguments he would adduce !
Parsing [sent. 7411 len. 12]: Henceforward and for ever there would be a gulf between them !
Parsing [sent. 7412 len. 13]: The poor religion he had would never serve to keep him straight !
Parsing [sent. 7413 len. 11]: What was it but a compromise with pride and self-sufficiency !
Parsing [sent. 7414 len. 7]: It could bear no such strain !
Parsing [sent. 7415 len. 21]: He acknowledged God , but not God reconciled in Christ , only God such as unregenerate man would have him !
Parsing [sent. 7416 len. 15]: And when Ian came home , he would be sure to side with Alister !
Parsing [sent. 7417 len. 21]: There was but one excuse for the poor boy -- and that a miserable one : the blinding of love !
Parsing [sent. 7418 len. 28]: Yes there was more excuse than that : to be lord of the old lands , with the old clan growing and gathering again about its chief !
Parsing [sent. 7419 len. 10]: It was a temptation fit to ruin an archangel !
Parsing [sent. 7420 len. 10]: What could he not do then for his people !
Parsing [sent. 7421 len. 9]: What could he not do for the land !
Parsing [sent. 7422 len. 15]: And for her , she might have her Ian always at home with her !
Parsing [sent. 7423 len. 13]: God forbid she should buy even such bliss at such a cost !
Parsing [sent. 7424 len. 37]: She was only thinking , she said to herself , how , if the thing had to be , she would make the best of it : she was bound as a mother to do that !
Parsing [sent. 7425 len. 9]: But the edge of the wedge was in .
Parsing [sent. 7426 len. 45]: She said to herself afterwards , that the enemy of her soul must have been lying in wait for her that night ; she almost believed in some bodily presence of him in her room : how otherwise could she account for her fall !
Parsing [sent. 7427 len. 25]: he must have been permitted to tempt her , because , in condemning evil , she had given way to contempt and worldly pride .
Parsing [sent. 7428 len. 6]: Her thoughts unchecked flowed forward .
Parsing [sent. 7429 len. 29]: They lingered brooding for a time on the joys that might be hers -- the joys of the mother of a chief over territory as well as hearts .
Parsing [sent. 7430 len. 13]: Then they stole round , and began to flow the other way .
Parsing [sent. 7431 len. 54]: Ere the thing had come she began to make the best of it for the sake of her son and the bond between them ; then she began to excuse it for the sake of the clan ; and now she began to justify it a little for the sake of the world !
Parsing [sent. 7432 len. 15]: Everything that could favour the acceptance of the offer came up clear before her .
Parsing [sent. 7433 len. 11]: The land was the same as it always had been !
Parsing [sent. 7434 len. 8]: it had never been in the distillery !
Parsing [sent. 7435 len. 8]: it had never been in the brew-house !
Parsing [sent. 7436 len. 17]: it was clean , whoever had transacted concerning it , through whatever hands it had passed !
Parsing [sent. 7437 len. 15]: A good cow was a good cow , had she been twenty times reaved !
Parsing [sent. 7438 len. 30]: For Mr. Palmer to give and Alister to take the land back , would be some amends to the nation , grievously injured in the money of its purchase !
Parsing [sent. 7439 len. 47]: The deed would restore to the redeeming and uplifting influence of her son many who were fast perishing from poverty and whisky ; for , their houses and crofts once more in the power of their chief , he would again be their landlord as well !
Parsing [sent. 7440 len. 12]: It would be a pure exercise of the law of compensation !
Parsing [sent. 7441 len. 41]: Hundreds who had gone abroad would return to replenish the old glens with the true national wealth -- with men and women , and children growing to be men and women , for the hour of their country 's need !
Parsing [sent. 7442 len. 9]: These were the true , the golden crops !
Parsing [sent. 7443 len. 34]: The glorious time she had herself seen would return , when Strathruadh could alone send out a regiment of the soldiers that may be defeated , but will not live to know it .
Parsing [sent. 7444 len. 9]: The dream of her boys would come true !
Parsing [sent. 7445 len. 19]: they would rebuild the old castle , and make it a landmark in the history of the highlands !
Parsing [sent. 7446 len. 102]: But while she stood elate upon this high-soaring peak of the dark mountains of ambition , sudden before her mind 's eye rose the face of her husband , sudden his voice was in her ear ; he seemed to stand above her in the pulpit , reading from the prophet Isaiah the four Woes that begin four contiguous chapters : -- `` Woe to the crown of pride , to the drunkards of Ephraim , whose glorious beauty is a fading flower , which are on the head of the fat valleys of them that are overcome with wine ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7447 len. 15]: -- `` Woe to Ariel , to Ariel , the city where David dwelt !
Parsing [sent. 7448 len. 18]: Add ye year to year ; let them kill sacrifices ; yet I will distress Ariel . ''
Parsing [sent. 7449 len. 43]: -- `` Woe to the rebellious children , saith the Lord , that take counsel , but not of me ; and that cover with a covering , but not of my spirit , that they may add sin to sin ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7450 len. 55]: -- '' Woe to them that go down to Egypt for help ; and stay on horses , and trust in chariots , because they are many ; and in horsemen , because they are very strong ; but they look not unto the holy one of Israel , neither seek the Lord ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7451 len. 27]: Then followed the words opening the next chapter : -- `` Behold , a king shall reign in righteousness , and princes shall rule in judgment .
Parsing [sent. 7452 len. 21]: And a man shall be as an hiding place from the wind , and a covert from the tempest . ''
Parsing [sent. 7453 len. 35]: All this , in solemn order , one woe after the other , she heard in the very voice of her husband ; in awful spiritual procession , they passed before her listening mind !
Parsing [sent. 7454 len. 12]: She grew cold as the dead , and shuddered and shivered .
Parsing [sent. 7455 len. 54]: She looked over the edge into the heart of a black gulf , into which she had been on the point of casting herself -- say rather , down whose side , searching for an easy descent , she had already slid a long way , when the voice from above recalled her !
Parsing [sent. 7456 len. 19]: She covered her face with her hands and wept -- ashamed before God , ashamed before her husband .
Parsing [sent. 7457 len. 14]: It was a shame unutterable that the thing should even have looked tempting !
Parsing [sent. 7458 len. 13]: She cried for forgiveness , rose , and sought Alister 's room .
Parsing [sent. 7459 len. 16]: Seldom since he was a man had she visited her elder son in his chamber .
Parsing [sent. 7460 len. 16]: She cherished for him , as chief , something of the reverence of the clan .
Parsing [sent. 7461 len. 14]: The same familiarity had never existed between them as between her and lan .
Parsing [sent. 7462 len. 16]: Now she was going to wake him , and hold a solemn talk with him .
Parsing [sent. 7463 len. 20]: Not a moment longer should he stand leaning over the gulf into which she had herself well nigh fallen !
Parsing [sent. 7464 len. 18]: She found him awake , and troubled , though not with an eternal trouble such as hers .
Parsing [sent. 7465 len. 12]: `` I thought I should find you asleep , Alister ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7466 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 7467 len. 10]: `` It was not very likely , mother ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7468 len. 4]: he answered gently .
Parsing [sent. 7469 len. 11]: `` You too have been tried with terrible thoughts ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7470 len. 22]: `` I have been tried , but ha ^ ly with terrible thoughts : I know that Mercy loves me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7471 len. 10]: `` Ah , my son , my dear son !
Parsing [sent. 7472 len. 7]: love itself is the terrible thing !
Parsing [sent. 7473 len. 13]: It has drawn many a man from the way of peace ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7474 len. 15]: `` Did it draw you and my father from the way of peace ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7475 len. 3]: asked Alister .
Parsing [sent. 7476 len. 7]: `` Not for a moment ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7477 len. 3]: she answered .
Parsing [sent. 7478 len. 11]: `` It made our steps firmer in the way . ''
Parsing [sent. 7479 len. 13]: `` Then why should you fear it will draw me from it ?
Parsing [sent. 7480 len. 18]: I hope I have never made you think I was not following my father and you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7481 len. 19]: `` Who knows what either of us might have done , with such a temptation as yours ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7482 len. 34]: `` Either you say , mother , that my father was not so good as I think him , or that he did what he did in his own strength ! '' '' '
Parsing [sent. 7483 len. 12]: Let him that thinketh ' -- you know the rest ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7484 len. 4]: rejoined the mother .
Parsing [sent. 7485 len. 14]: `` I do n't think I am tempted to anything just now . ''
Parsing [sent. 7486 len. 8]: `` There it is , you see !
Parsing [sent. 7487 len. 14]: -- the temptation so subtle that you do not suspect its character ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7488 len. 17]: `` I am confident my father would have done just as I mean to do ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7489 len. 9]: `` What do you mean to do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7490 len. 9]: `` Is it my own mother asks me ?
Parsing [sent. 7491 len. 11]: Does she distrust her husband and her son together ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7492 len. 21]: It began to dawn on the mother that she had fallen into her own temptation through distrust of her son .
Parsing [sent. 7493 len. 27]: Because she-distrusted him , she sought excuse for him , and excuse had turned to all but justification : she had given place to the devil !
Parsing [sent. 7494 len. 8]: But she must be sure about Alister !
Parsing [sent. 7495 len. 17]: She had had enough of the wiles of Satan : she must not trust her impressions !
Parsing [sent. 7496 len. 12]: The enemy might even now be bent on deceiving her afresh !
Parsing [sent. 7497 len. 34]: For a moment she kept silence , then said : -- `` It would be a grand thing to have the whole country-side your own again -- would n't it , Alister ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7498 len. 7]: `` It would , mother ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7499 len. 3]: he answered .
Parsing [sent. 7500 len. 13]: `` And have all your people quite under your own care ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7501 len. 10]: `` A grand thing , indeed , mother ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7502 len. 14]: `` How can you say then it is no temptation to you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7503 len. 7]: `` Because it is none . ''
Parsing [sent. 7504 len. 6]: `` How is that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7505 len. 17]: `` I would not have my clan under a factor of Satan 's , mother ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7506 len. 8]: `` I do not understand you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7507 len. 21]: `` What else should I be , if I accepted the oversight of them on terms of allegiance to him !
Parsing [sent. 7508 len. 7]: That was how he tempted Jesus .
Parsing [sent. 7509 len. 19]: I will not be the devil 's steward , to call any land or any people mine ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7510 len. 24]: His mother kissed him on the forehead , walked erect from the room , and went to her own to humble herself afresh .
Parsing [sent. 7511 len. 26]: In the morning , Alister took his dinner of bread and cheese in his pocket , and set out for the tomb on the hill-top .
Parsing [sent. 7512 len. 16]: There he remained until the evening , and wrote his answer , sorely missing Ian .
Parsing [sent. 7513 len. 34]: He hegged Mr. Peregrine Palmer to dismiss the idea of enriching him , thanked him for his great liberality , but declared himself entirely content , and determined not to change his position .
Parsing [sent. 7514 len. 12]: He could not and would not avail himself of his generosity .
Parsing [sent. 7515 len. 49]: Mr. Palmer , unable to suspect the reasons at work in the chief 's mind , pleased with the genuineness of his acknowledgment , and regarding him as a silly fellow who would quixotically outdo him in magnanimity , answered in a more familiar , almost jocular strain .
Parsing [sent. 7516 len. 55]: He must not be unreasonable , he said ; pride was no doubt an estimable weakness , but it might be carried too far ; men must act upon realities not fancies ; he must learn to have an eye to the main chance , and eschew heroics : what was life without money !
Parsing [sent. 7517 len. 17]: It was not as if he gave it grudgingly , for he made him heartily welcome .
Parsing [sent. 7518 len. 11]: The property was in truth but a flea-bite to him !
Parsing [sent. 7519 len. 28]: He hoped the Macruadh would live long to enjoy it , and make his father-in-law the great grandfather of chiefs , perpetuating his memory to ages unborn .
Parsing [sent. 7520 len. 26]: There was more to the same effect , void neither of eloquence nor of a certain good-heartedness , which the laird both recognized and felt .
Parsing [sent. 7521 len. 7]: It was again his painful turn .
Parsing [sent. 7522 len. 15]: He had now to make his refusal as positive as words could make it .
Parsing [sent. 7523 len. 32]: He said he was sorry to appear headstrong , perhaps uncivil and ungrateful , but he could not and would not accept anything beyond the priceless gift of Mercy 's hand .
Parsing [sent. 7524 len. 25]: Not even then did Peregrine Palmer divine that his offered gift was despised ; that idea was to him all but impossible of conception .
Parsing [sent. 7525 len. 13]: He read merely opposition , and was determined to have his way .
Parsing [sent. 7526 len. 27]: Next time he too wrote positively , though far from unkindly : -- the Macruadh must take the land with his daughter , or leave both !
Parsing [sent. 7527 len. 42]: The chief replied that he could not yield his claim to Mercy , for he loved her , and believed she loved him ; therefore begged Mr. Peregrine Palmer , of his generosity , to leave the decision with his daughter .
Parsing [sent. 7528 len. 25]: The next was a letter from Mercy , entreating Alister not to hurt her father by seeming to doubt the kindness of his intentions .
Parsing [sent. 7529 len. 42]: She assured him her father was not the man to interfere with his management of the estate , the shooting was all he cared about ; and if that was the difficulty , she imagined even that might be got over .
Parsing [sent. 7530 len. 31]: She ended praying that he would , for her sake , cease making much of a trifle , for such the greatest property in the world must be betwixt them .
Parsing [sent. 7531 len. 24]: No man , she said , could love a woman right , who would not be under the poorest obligation to her people !
Parsing [sent. 7532 len. 68]: The chief answered her in the tenderest way , assuring her that if the property had been hers he would only have blessed her for it ; that he was not making much ado about nothing ; that pride , or unwillingness to be indebted , had nothing to do with his determination ; that the thing was with him in very truth a matter of conscience .
Parsing [sent. 7533 len. 45]: He implored her therefore from the bottom of his heart to do her best to persuade her father -- if she would save him who loved her more than his own soul , from a misery God only could make him able to bear .
Parsing [sent. 7534 len. 4]: Mercy was bewildered .
Parsing [sent. 7535 len. 6]: She neither understood nor suspected .
Parsing [sent. 7536 len. 43]: She wrote again , saying her father was now thoroughly angry ; that she found herself without argument , the thing being incomprehensible to her as to her father ; that she could not see where the conscience of the thing lay .
Parsing [sent. 7537 len. 65]: Her terror was , that , if he persisted , she would be driven to think he did not care for her ; his behaviour she had tried in vain to reconcile with what he had taught her ; if he destroyed her faith in him , all her faith might go , and she be left without God as well as without him !
Parsing [sent. 7538 len. 21]: Then Alister saw that necessity had culminated , and that it was no longer possi ble to hold anything back .
Parsing [sent. 7539 len. 24]: Whatever other suffering he might cause her , Mercy must not be left to think him capable of sacrificing her to an absurdity !
Parsing [sent. 7540 len. 20]: She must know the truth of the matter , and how it was to him of the deepest conscience !
Parsing [sent. 7541 len. 54]: He must let her see that if he allowed her to persuade him , it would be to go about thenceforward consumed of self-contempt , a slave to the property , no more its owner than if he had stolen it , and in danger of committing suicide to escape hating his wife !
Parsing [sent. 7542 len. 34]: For the man without a tender conscience , can not imagine the state to which another may come , who carries one about with him , stinging and accusing him all day long .
Parsing [sent. 7543 len. 18]: So , out of a heart aching with very fullness , Alister wrote the truth to Mercy .
Parsing [sent. 7544 len. 89]: And Mercy , though it filled her with grief and shame , had so much love for the truth , and for the man who had waked that love , that she understood him , and loved him through all the pain of his words ; loved him the more for daring the risk of losing her ; loved him yet the more for cleaving to her while loathing the mere thought of sharing her wealth ; loved him most of all that he was immaculate in truth .
Parsing [sent. 7545 len. 23]: She carried the letter to her father 's room , laid it before him without a word , and went out again .
Parsing [sent. 7546 len. 10]: The storm gathered swiftly , and burst at once .
Parsing [sent. 7547 len. 25]: Not two minutes seemed to have passed when she heard his door open , and a voice of wrathful displeasure call out her name .
Parsing [sent. 7548 len. 10]: She returned -- in fear , but in fortitude .
Parsing [sent. 7549 len. 7]: Then first she knew her father !
Parsing [sent. 7550 len. 20]: -- for although wrath and injustice were at home in him , they seldom showed themselves out of doors .
Parsing [sent. 7551 len. 20]: He treated her as a willing party to an unspeakable insult from a highland boor to her own father .
Parsing [sent. 7552 len. 16]: To hand him such a letter was the same as to have written it herself !
Parsing [sent. 7553 len. 18]: She identified herself with the writer when she became the bearer of the mangy hound 's insolence !
Parsing [sent. 7554 len. 13]: He raged at Mercy as in truth he had never raged before .
Parsing [sent. 7555 len. 18]: If once she spoke to the fellow again , he would turn her out of the house !
Parsing [sent. 7556 len. 7]: She would have left the room .
Parsing [sent. 7557 len. 25]: He locked the door , set a chair before his writing table , and ordered her to sit there and write to his dictation .
Parsing [sent. 7558 len. 25]: But no power on earth or under it would have prevailed to make Mercy write as her own the words that were not hers .
Parsing [sent. 7559 len. 9]: `` You must excuse me , papa ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7560 len. 10]: she said in a tone unheard from her before .
Parsing [sent. 7561 len. 24]: This raising of the rampart of human dignity , crowned with refusal , between him and his own child , galled him afresh .
Parsing [sent. 7562 len. 8]: `` Then you shall be compelled ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7563 len. 11]: he said , with an oath through his clenched teeth .
Parsing [sent. 7564 len. 6]: Mercy stood silent and motionless .
Parsing [sent. 7565 len. 6]: `` Go to your room .
Parsing [sent. 7566 len. 15]: By heaven you shall stay there till you do as I tell you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7567 len. 8]: He was between her and the door .
Parsing [sent. 7568 len. 16]: `` You need not think to gain your point by obstinacy , '' he added .
Parsing [sent. 7569 len. 28]: `` I swear that not another word shall pass between you and that blockhead of a chief -- not if I have to turn watch-dog myself ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7570 len. 13]: He made way for her , but did not open the door .
Parsing [sent. 7571 len. 15]: She left the room too angry to cry , and went to her own .
Parsing [sent. 7572 len. 8]: Her fear of her father had vanished .
Parsing [sent. 7573 len. 12]: With Alister on her side she could stand against the world !
Parsing [sent. 7574 len. 6]: She went to her window .
Parsing [sent. 7575 len. 35]: She could not see the cottage from it , but she could see the ruin , and the hill of the crescent fire , on which she had passed through the shadow of death .
Parsing [sent. 7576 len. 27]: Gazing on the hill she remembered what Alister would have her do , and with her Father in heaven sought shelter from her father on earth .
Parsing [sent. 7577 len. 5]: CHAPTER VIII MISTRESS CONAL .
Parsing [sent. 7578 len. 44]: Mr. Peregrine Palmer 's generosity had in part rested on the idea of securing the estate against reverse of fortune , sufficiently possible though not expected ; while with the improvements almost in hand , the shooting would make him a large return .
Parsing [sent. 7579 len. 32]: He felt the more wronged by the ridiculous scruples of the chief -- in which after all , though he could not have said why , he did not quite believe .
Parsing [sent. 7580 len. 54]: It never occurred to him that , even had the land been so come by that the chief could accept a gift of it , he would , upon the discovery that it had been so secured from the donor 's creditors , at once have insisted on placing it at their disposal .
Parsing [sent. 7581 len. 31]: His wrath proceeded to vent itself in hastening the realization of his schemes of improvement , for he was well aware they would be worse than distasteful to the Macruadh .
Parsing [sent. 7582 len. 38]: Their first requirement was the removal of every peasant within his power capable of violating the sanctity of the deer forest into which he and his next neighbour had agreed to turn the whole of their property .
Parsing [sent. 7583 len. 47]: While the settlement of his daughter was pending , he had seen that the point might cause trouble unless previously understood between him and the chief ; but he never doubted the recovery of the land would reconcile the latter to the loss of the men .
Parsing [sent. 7584 len. 64]: Now he chuckled with wrathful chuckle to think how entirely he had him in his power for justifiable annoyance ; for he believed himself about to do nothing but good to THE COUNTRY in removing from it its miserable inhabitants , whom the sentimental indulgence of their so-called chief kept contented with their poverty , and with whom interference must now enrage him .
Parsing [sent. 7585 len. 8]: How he hated the whole wretched pack !
Parsing [sent. 7586 len. 33]: Mr. Palmer 's doing of good to the country consisted in making the land yield more money into the pockets of Mr. Brander and himself by feeding wild animals instead of men .
Parsing [sent. 7587 len. 39]: To tell such land-owners that they are simply running a tilt at the creative energy , can be of no use : they do not believe in God , however much they may protest and imagine they do .
Parsing [sent. 7588 len. 29]: The next day but one , he sent Mistress Conal the message that she must be out of her hut , goods and gear , within a fortnight .
Parsing [sent. 7589 len. 17]: He was not sure that the thing was legally correct , but he would risk it .
Parsing [sent. 7590 len. 18]: She might go to law if she would , but he would make a beginning with her !
Parsing [sent. 7591 len. 34]: The chief might take up her quarrel if he chose : nothing would please Mr. Palmer more than to involve him in a law-suit , clear him out , and send him adrift !
Parsing [sent. 7592 len. 16]: His money might be contemptible , but the chief should find it at least dangerous !
Parsing [sent. 7593 len. 8]: Contempt would not stave off a land-slip !
Parsing [sent. 7594 len. 69]: Mistress Conal , with a rage and scorn that made her feel every inch a witch , and accompanied by her black cat , which might or might not be the innocent animal the neighbours did not think him , hurried to the Macruadh , and informed him that `` the lowland thief '' had given her notice to quit the house of her fathers within a fortnight .
Parsing [sent. 7595 len. 10]: `` I fear much we can not help it !
Parsing [sent. 7596 len. 8]: the house is on his land ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7597 len. 5]: said the chief sorrowfully .
Parsing [sent. 7598 len. 5]: `` His land ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7599 len. 5]: echoed the old woman .
Parsing [sent. 7600 len. 11]: `` Is the nest of the old eagle his land ?
Parsing [sent. 7601 len. 11]: Can he make his heather white or his ptarmigan black ?
Parsing [sent. 7602 len. 12]: Will he dry up the lochs , and stay the rivers ?
Parsing [sent. 7603 len. 21]: Will he remove the mountains from their places , or cause the generations of men to cease from the earth ?
Parsing [sent. 7604 len. 5]: Defend me , chief !
Parsing [sent. 7605 len. 18]: I come to you for the help that was never sought in vain from the Macruadh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7606 len. 16]: `` What help I have is yours without the asking , '' returned the chief .
Parsing [sent. 7607 len. 12]: `` I can not do more than is in my power !
Parsing [sent. 7608 len. 18]: One thing only I can promise you -- that you shall lack neither food nor shelter . ''
Parsing [sent. 7609 len. 11]: `` My chief will abandon me to the wolf ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7610 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 7611 len. 3]: `` Never !
Parsing [sent. 7612 len. 11]: But I can only protect you , not your house .
Parsing [sent. 7613 len. 24]: He may have no right to turn you out at such short notice ; but it could only be a matter of weeks .
Parsing [sent. 7614 len. 23]: To go to law with him would but leave me without a roof to shelter you when your own was gone ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7615 len. 20]: `` The dead would have shown him into the dark , ere he turned me into the cold ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7616 len. 9]: she muttered , and turning , left him .
Parsing [sent. 7617 len. 6]: The chief was greatly troubled .
Parsing [sent. 7618 len. 15]: He had heard nothing of such an intention on the part of his neighbour .
Parsing [sent. 7619 len. 6]: Could it be for revenge ?
Parsing [sent. 7620 len. 11]: He had heard nothing yet of his answer to Mercy !
Parsing [sent. 7621 len. 35]: All he could do was to represent to Mr. Palmer the trouble the poor woman was in , and let him know that the proceeding threatened would render him very unpopular in the strath .
Parsing [sent. 7622 len. 10]: This he thought it best to do by letter .
Parsing [sent. 7623 len. 14]: It could not enrage Mr. Palmer more , but it enraged him afresh .
Parsing [sent. 7624 len. 45]: He vowed that the moment the time was up , out the old witch should go , neck and crop ; and with the help of Mr. Brander , provided men for the enforcement of his purpose who did not belong to the neighbourhood .
Parsing [sent. 7625 len. 25]: The chief kept hoping to hear from the New House , but neither his letter to Mercy nor to her father received any answer .
Parsing [sent. 7626 len. 14]: How he wished for lan to tell him what he ought to do !
Parsing [sent. 7627 len. 7]: His mother could not help him .
Parsing [sent. 7628 len. 9]: He saw nothing for it but wait events .
Parsing [sent. 7629 len. 10]: Day after day passed , and he heard nothing .
Parsing [sent. 7630 len. 27]: He would have tried to find out the state of things at the New House , but until war was declared that would not be right !
Parsing [sent. 7631 len. 31]: Mr. Palmer might be seeking how with dignity to move in the matter , for certainly the chief had placed him in a position yet more unpleasant than his own !
Parsing [sent. 7632 len. 5]: He must wait on !
Parsing [sent. 7633 len. 67]: The very day fortnight after the notice given , about three o'clock in the afternoon , came flying to the chief a ragged little urchin of the village , too breathless almost to make intelligible his news -- that there were men at Mistress Conal 's who would not go out of her house , and she and her old black cat were swearing at them .
Parsing [sent. 7634 len. 17]: The chief ran : could the new laird be actually unhousing the aged , helpless woman ?
Parsing [sent. 7635 len. 13]: It was the part of a devil and not of a man !
Parsing [sent. 7636 len. 16]: As he neared the place -- there were her poor possessions already on the roadside !
Parsing [sent. 7637 len. 31]: -- her one chair and stool , her bedding , her three-footed pot , her girdle , her big chest , all that she could call hers in the world !
Parsing [sent. 7638 len. 33]: and when he came in sight of the cottage , there she was being brought out of it , struggling , screaming , and cursing , in the grasp of two men !
Parsing [sent. 7639 len. 28]: Fierce in its glow was the torrent of Gaelic that rushed from the crater of her lips , molten in the volcanic depths of her indignant soul .
Parsing [sent. 7640 len. 56]: When one thinks of the appalling amount of rage exhausted by poor humans upon wrong , the energy of indignation , whether issued or suppressed , and how little it has done to right wrong , to draw acknowledgment or amends from self-satisfied insolence , he naturally asks what becomes of so much vital force .
Parsing [sent. 7641 len. 12]: Can it fare differently from other forces , and be lost ?
Parsing [sent. 7642 len. 30]: The energy of evil is turned into the mill-race of good ; but the wrath of man , even his righteous wrath , worketh not the righteousness of God !
Parsing [sent. 7643 len. 5]: What becomes of it ?
Parsing [sent. 7644 len. 22]: If it be not lost , and have but changed its form , in what shape shall we look for it ?
Parsing [sent. 7645 len. 10]: `` Set her down , '' cried the chief .
Parsing [sent. 7646 len. 9]: `` I will take care of her . ''
Parsing [sent. 7647 len. 41]: When she heard the voice of her champion , the old woman let go a cat-like screech of triumph , and her gliding Gaelic , smoothness itself in articulation , flowed yet firier in word , and fiercer in tone .
Parsing [sent. 7648 len. 36]: But the who were thus ejecting her -- hangers on of the sheriff-court in the county town , employed to give a colour of law to the doubtful proceeding -- did not know the chief .
Parsing [sent. 7649 len. 23]: `` Oh , we 'll set her down , '' answered one of them insolently , '' -- and glad enough too !
Parsing [sent. 7650 len. 15]: but we 'll have her on the public road with her sticks first ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7651 len. 29]: Infuriated by the man 's disregard of her chief , Mistress Conal struck her nails into his face , and with a curse he flung her from him .
Parsing [sent. 7652 len. 35]: She turned instantly on the other with the same argument ad hominem , and found herself staggering on her own weak limbs to a severe fall , when the chief caught and saved her .
Parsing [sent. 7653 len. 34]: She struggled hard to break from him and rush again into the hut , declaring she would not leave it if they burned her alive in it , but he held her fast .
Parsing [sent. 7654 len. 34]: There was a pause , for one or two who had accompanied the men employed , knew the chief , and their reluctance to go on with the ruthless deed in his presence .
Parsing [sent. 7655 len. 4]: influenced the rest .
Parsing [sent. 7656 len. 16]: Report of the ejection had spread , and the neighbours came running from the village .
Parsing [sent. 7657 len. 7]: A crowd seemed to be gathering .
Parsing [sent. 7658 len. 16]: Again and again Mistress Conal tried to escape from Alister and rush into the cottage .
Parsing [sent. 7659 len. 8]: `` You too , my chief ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7660 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 7661 len. 11]: `` You turned against the poor of your people ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7662 len. 10]: `` No , Mistress Conal , '' he answered .
Parsing [sent. 7663 len. 14]: `` I am too much your friend to let you kill yourself ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7664 len. 26]: `` We have orders , Macruadh , to set fire to the hovel , '' said one of the men , touching his hat respectfully .
Parsing [sent. 7665 len. 9]: `` They 'll roast my black one ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7666 len. 5]: shrieked the old woman .
Parsing [sent. 7667 len. 25]: `` Small fear for him , '' said a man 's voice from the little crowd , `` if half be true -- ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7668 len. 7]: Apparently the speaker dared no more .
Parsing [sent. 7669 len. 18]: `` Fire wo n't singe a hair of him , Mistress Conal , '' said another voice .
Parsing [sent. 7670 len. 12]: `` You know it ; he 's used to it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7671 len. 12]: `` Come along , and let 's get it over ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7672 len. 7]: cried the leader of the ejection-party .
Parsing [sent. 7673 len. 32]: `` It -- wo n't take many minutes once it 's well a going , and there 's fire enough on the hearth to set Ben Cruachan in a blaze ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7674 len. 8]: `` Is everything out of it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7675 len. 4]: demanded the chief .
Parsing [sent. 7676 len. 6]: `` All but her cat .
Parsing [sent. 7677 len. 20]: We 've done our best , sir , and searched everywhere , but he 's not to be found .
Parsing [sent. 7678 len. 7]: There 's nothing else left . ''
Parsing [sent. 7679 len. 7]: `` It 's a lie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7680 len. 4]: screamed Mistress Conal .
Parsing [sent. 7681 len. 19]: `` Is there not a great pile of peats , carried on my own back from the moss !
Parsing [sent. 7682 len. 5]: Ach , you robbers !
Parsing [sent. 7683 len. 8]: Would you burn the good peats ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7684 len. 28]: `` What good will the peats be to you , woman , '' said one of them not unkindly , `` when you have no hearth ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7685 len. 10]: She gave a loud wail , but checked it .
Parsing [sent. 7686 len. 13]: `` I will burn them on the road , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 7687 len. 12]: `` They will keep me a few hours from the dark !
Parsing [sent. 7688 len. 33]: When I die I will go straight up to God and implore his curse upon you , on your bed and board , your hands and tools , your body and soul .
Parsing [sent. 7689 len. 18]: May your every prayer be lost in the wide murk , and never come at his ears !
Parsing [sent. 7690 len. 6]: May -- '' `` Hush !
Parsing [sent. 7691 len. 3]: hush ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7692 len. 7]: interposed the chief with great gentleness .
Parsing [sent. 7693 len. 10]: `` You do not know what you are saying .
Parsing [sent. 7694 len. 13]: But you do know who tells us to forgive our enemies ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7695 len. 39]: `` It 's well for HIM to forgive , '' she screamed , `` sitting on his grand throne , and leaving me to be turned out of my blessed house , on to the cold road ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7696 len. 4]: `` Nannie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7697 len. 35]: said the chief , calling her by her name , `` because a man is unjust to you , is that a reason for you to be unjust to him who died for you ?
Parsing [sent. 7698 len. 19]: You know as well as he , that you will not be left out on the cold road .
Parsing [sent. 7699 len. 28]: He knows , and so do you , that while I have a house over my head , there is a warm corner in it for you !
Parsing [sent. 7700 len. 42]: And as for his sitting on his throne , you know that all these years he has been trying to take you up beside him , and ca n't get you to set your foot on the first step of it !
Parsing [sent. 7701 len. 8]: Be ashamed of yourself , Nannie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7702 len. 4]: She was silent .
Parsing [sent. 7703 len. 36]: `` Bring out her peats , '' he said , turning to the bystanders ; `` we have small need , with winter on the road , to waste any of God 's gifts ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7704 len. 3]: They obeyed .
Parsing [sent. 7705 len. 41]: But as they carried them out , and down to the road , the number of Mistress Conal 's friends kept growing , and a laying together of heads began , and a gathering of human fire under glooming eyebrows .
Parsing [sent. 7706 len. 4]: It looked threatening .
Parsing [sent. 7707 len. 27]: Suddenly Mistress Conal broke out in a wild yet awful speech , wherein truth indeed was the fuel , but earthly wrath supplied the prophetic fire .
Parsing [sent. 7708 len. 15]: Her friends suspended their talk , and her foes their work , to listen .
Parsing [sent. 7709 len. 23]: English is by no means equally poetic with the Gaelic , regarded as a language , and ill-serves to represent her utterance .
Parsing [sent. 7710 len. 22]: Much that seems natural in the one language , seems forced and unreal amidst the less imaginative forms of the other .
Parsing [sent. 7711 len. 19]: I will nevertheless attempt in English what can prove little better than an imitation of her prophetic outpouring .
Parsing [sent. 7712 len. 73]: It was like a sermon in this , that she began with a text : -- `` Woe unto them , '' she said -- and her voice sounded like the wind among the great stones of a hillside -- '' that join house to house , that lay field to field , till there be no place , that they may be placed alone in the midst of the earth ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7713 len. 38]: This woe she followed with woe upon woe , and curse upon curse , now from the Bible , now from some old poem of the country , and now from the bitterness of her own heart .
Parsing [sent. 7714 len. 56]: Then she broke out in purely native eloquence : -- `` Who art thou , O man , born of a woman , to say to thy brother , ` Depart from this earth : here is no footing for thee : all the room had been taken for me ere thou wast heard of !
Parsing [sent. 7715 len. 26]: What right hast thou in a world where I want room for the red deer , and the big sheep , and the brown cattle ?
Parsing [sent. 7716 len. 7]: Go up , thou infant bald-head !
Parsing [sent. 7717 len. 13]: Is there not room above , in the fields of the air ?
Parsing [sent. 7718 len. 9]: Is there not room below with the dead ?
Parsing [sent. 7719 len. 10]: Verily there is none here upon the earth ! '
Parsing [sent. 7720 len. 26]: Who art thou , I say , to speak thus to thy fellow , as if he entered the world by another door than thyself !
Parsing [sent. 7721 len. 12]: Because thou art rich , is he not also a man ?
Parsing [sent. 7722 len. 12]: -- a man made in the image of the same God ?
Parsing [sent. 7723 len. 6]: Who but God sent him ?
Parsing [sent. 7724 len. 17]: And who but God , save thy father was indeed the devil , hath sent thee ?
Parsing [sent. 7725 len. 9]: Thou hast to make room for thy brother !
Parsing [sent. 7726 len. 27]: What brother of thy house , when a child is born into it , would presume to say , ` Let him begone , and speedily !
Parsing [sent. 7727 len. 6]: I do not want him !
Parsing [sent. 7728 len. 7]: There is no room for him !
Parsing [sent. 7729 len. 8]: I require it all for myself ! '
Parsing [sent. 7730 len. 21]: Wilt thou say of any man , ` He is not my brother , ' when God says he is !
Parsing [sent. 7731 len. 12]: If thou say , ` Am I therefore his keeper ? '
Parsing [sent. 7732 len. 13]: God for that saying will brand thee with the brand of Cain .
Parsing [sent. 7733 len. 51]: Yea , the hour will come when those ye will not give room to breathe , will rise panting in the agony , yea fury of their need , and cry , ` If we may neither eat nor lie down by their leave , lo , we are strong !
Parsing [sent. 7734 len. 9]: let us take what they will not give !
Parsing [sent. 7735 len. 8]: If we die we but die ! '
Parsing [sent. 7736 len. 48]: Then shall there be blood to the knees of the fighting men , yea , to the horses ' bridles ; and the earth shall be left desolate because of you , foul feeders on the flesh and blood , on the bodies and souls of men !
Parsing [sent. 7737 len. 31]: In the pit of hell you will find room enough , but no drop of water ; and it will comfort you little that ye lived merrily among pining men !
Parsing [sent. 7738 len. 11]: Which of us has coveted your silver or your gold ?
Parsing [sent. 7739 len. 17]: Which of us has stretched out the hand to take of your wheat or your barley ?
Parsing [sent. 7740 len. 8]: All we ask is room to live !
Parsing [sent. 7741 len. 55]: But because ye would see the dust of the earth on the head of the poor , ye have crushed and straitened us till we are ready to cry out , ` God , for thy mercy 's sake , let us die , lest we be guilty of our own blood ! ' ''
Parsing [sent. 7742 len. 15]: A solitary man had come down the hill behind , and stood alone listening .
Parsing [sent. 7743 len. 8]: It was the mover of the wickedness .
Parsing [sent. 7744 len. 68]: In the old time the rights of the people in the land were fully recognized ; but when the chiefs of Clanruadh sold it , they could not indeed sell the rights that were not theirs , but they forgot to secure them for the help - less , and they were now in the grasp of the selfish and greedy , the devourers of the poor .
Parsing [sent. 7745 len. 33]: He did not understand a word the woman was saying , but he was pleased to look on her rage , and see the man who had insulted him suffer with her .
Parsing [sent. 7746 len. 46]: When he began to note the glances of lurid fire which every now and then turned upon him during Mistress Conal 's speech , he scorned the indication : such poor creatures dared venture nothing , he thought , against the mere appearance of law .
Parsing [sent. 7747 len. 49]: Under what he counted the chiefs contempt , he had already grown worse ; and the thought that perhaps the great world might one day look upon him with like contempt , wrought in him bitterly ; he had not the assurance of rectitude which makes contempt hurtless .
Parsing [sent. 7748 len. 14]: He was crueller now than before the chief 's letter to his daughter .
Parsing [sent. 7749 len. 13]: When Mistress Conal saw him , she addressed herself to him directly .
Parsing [sent. 7750 len. 14]: What he would have felt had he understood , I can not tell .
Parsing [sent. 7751 len. 23]: Never in this life did he know how the weak can despise the strong , how the poor can scorn the rich !
Parsing [sent. 7752 len. 4]: `` Worm ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7753 len. 19]: she said , `` uncontent with holding the land , eating the earth that another may not share !
Parsing [sent. 7754 len. 21]: the worms eat but what their bodies will hold , and thou canst devour but the fill of thy life !
Parsing [sent. 7755 len. 26]: The hour is at hand when the earth will swallow thee , and thy fellow worms will eat thee , as thou hast eaten men .
Parsing [sent. 7756 len. 15]: The possessions of thy brethren thou hast consumed , so that they are not !
Parsing [sent. 7757 len. 28]: The holy and beautiful house of my fathers , -- '' She spoke of her poor little cottage , but in the words lay spiritual fact . ''
Parsing [sent. 7758 len. 7]: -- mock not its poverty ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7759 len. 36]: she went on , as if forestalling contempt ; `` for is it not to me a holy house where the woman lay in the agony whence first I opened my eyes to the sun ?
Parsing [sent. 7760 len. 23]: Is it not a holy house where my father prayed morning and evening , and read the words of grace and comfort ?
Parsing [sent. 7761 len. 22]: Is it not to me sacred as the cottage at Nazareth to the poor man who lived there with his peasants ?
Parsing [sent. 7762 len. 22]: And is not that a beautiful house in which a woman 's ear did first listen to the words of love ?
Parsing [sent. 7763 len. 39]: Old and despised I am , but once I was younger than any of you , and ye will be old and decrepit as I , if the curse of God do not cut you off too soon .
Parsing [sent. 7764 len. 15]: My Alister would have taken any two of you and knocked your heads together .
Parsing [sent. 7765 len. 24]: He died fighting for his country ; and for his sake the voice of man 's love has never again entered my heart !
Parsing [sent. 7766 len. 12]: I knew a true man , and could be true also .
Parsing [sent. 7767 len. 8]: Would to God I were with him !
Parsing [sent. 7768 len. 12]: You man-trapping , land-reaving , house-burning Sasunnach , do your worst !
Parsing [sent. 7769 len. 5]: I care not . ''
Parsing [sent. 7770 len. 9]: She ceased , and the spell was broken .
Parsing [sent. 7771 len. 6]: `` Come , come ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7772 len. 7]: said one of the men impatiently .
Parsing [sent. 7773 len. 22]: `` Tom , you get a peat , and set it on the top of the wall , under the roof .
Parsing [sent. 7774 len. 6]: You , too , George !
Parsing [sent. 7775 len. 5]: -- and be quick .
Parsing [sent. 7776 len. 4]: Peats all around !
Parsing [sent. 7777 len. 7]: there are plenty on the hearth !
Parsing [sent. 7778 len. 7]: -- How 's the wind blowing ?
Parsing [sent. 7779 len. 25]: -- You , Henry , make a few holes in the wall here , outside , and we 'll set live peats in them .
Parsing [sent. 7780 len. 11]: It 's time there was an end to this ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7781 len. 16]: `` You 're right ; but there 's a better way to end it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7782 len. 18]: returned one of the clan , and gave him a shove that sent him to the ground .
Parsing [sent. 7783 len. 8]: `` Men , do your duty ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7784 len. 7]: cried Mr. Palmer from behind . ''
Parsing [sent. 7785 len. 12]: _ I _ am here -- to see you do it !
Parsing [sent. 7786 len. 6]: Never mind the old woman !
Parsing [sent. 7787 len. 16]: Of course she thinks it hard ; but hard things have got to be done !
Parsing [sent. 7788 len. 15]: it 's the way of the world , and all for the best . ''
Parsing [sent. 7789 len. 39]: `` Mr. Palmer , '' said another of the clan , `` the old woman has the right of you : she and hers have lived there , in that cottage , for nigh a hundred years . ''
Parsing [sent. 7790 len. 6]: `` She has no right .
Parsing [sent. 7791 len. 15]: If she thinks she has , let her go to the law for it .
Parsing [sent. 7792 len. 12]: In the meantime I choose to turn her off my land .
Parsing [sent. 7793 len. 22]: What 's mine 's mine , as I mean every man jack of you to know -- chief and beggar ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7794 len. 7]: The Macruadh walked up to him .
Parsing [sent. 7795 len. 26]: `` Pardon me , sir , '' he said : `` I doubt much if you have a legal right to disturb the poor woman .
Parsing [sent. 7796 len. 21]: She has never paid rent for her hut , and it has always been looked upon as her property . ''
Parsing [sent. 7797 len. 14]: `` Then the chief that sold it swindled both me and her ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7798 len. 8]: stammered Mr. Palmer , white with rage .
Parsing [sent. 7799 len. 38]: `` But as for you who call yourself a chief , you are the most insolent , ill-bred fellow I ever had to do with , and I have not another word to say to you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7800 len. 23]: A silence like that before a thunderstorm succeeded : not a man of the clan could for the moment trust his hearing .
Parsing [sent. 7801 len. 32]: But there is nothing the Celtic nature resents like rudeness : half a dozen at once of the Macruadhs rushed upon the insulter of their chief , intent on his punishment .
Parsing [sent. 7802 len. 19]: `` One of you touch him , '' cried Alister , `` and I will knock him down .
Parsing [sent. 7803 len. 9]: I would if he were my foster-brother ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7804 len. 8]: Each eager assailant stood like a block .
Parsing [sent. 7805 len. 8]: `` Finish your work , men ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7806 len. 4]: shouted Mr. Palmer .
Parsing [sent. 7807 len. 10]: To do him justice , he was no coward .
Parsing [sent. 7808 len. 15]: `` Clansmen , '' said the chief , `` let him have his way .
Parsing [sent. 7809 len. 20]: I do not see how to resist the wrong without bringing more evil upon us than we can meet .
Parsing [sent. 7810 len. 15]: We must leave it to him who says ` Vengeance is mine . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 7811 len. 12]: The Macruadhs murmured their obedience , and stood sullenly looking on .
Parsing [sent. 7812 len. 16]: The disseizors went into the hut , and carried out the last of the fuel .
Parsing [sent. 7813 len. 31]: Then they scooped holes in the turf walls , inside to leeward , outside to windward , and taking live peats from the hearth , put them in the holes .
Parsing [sent. 7814 len. 19]: A few minutes , and poor Nannie 's `` holy and beautiful house '' was a great fire .
Parsing [sent. 7815 len. 28]: When they began to apply the peats , Alister would at once have taken the old woman away , but he dreaded an outbreak , and lingered .
Parsing [sent. 7816 len. 22]: When the fire began to run up the roof , Mistress Conal broke from him , and darted to the door .
Parsing [sent. 7817 len. 13]: Every one rushed to seize her , Mr. Palmer with the rest .
Parsing [sent. 7818 len. 3]: `` Blackie !
Parsing [sent. 7819 len. 2]: Blackie !
Parsing [sent. 7820 len. 3]: Blackie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7821 len. 6]: she shrieked like a madwoman .
Parsing [sent. 7822 len. 66]: While the men encumbered each other in their endeavours to get her away , down shot the cat from the blazing roof , a fizz of fire in his black fur , his tail as thick as his neck , an infernal howling screech of hatred in his horrible throat , and , wild with rage and fear , flung himself straight upon Mr. Palmer .
Parsing [sent. 7823 len. 8]: A roar of delighted laughter burst forth .
Parsing [sent. 7824 len. 56]: He bawled out -- and his bawl was mingled with a scream -- to take the brute off him , and his own men hurried to his rescue ; but the fury-frantic animal had dug his claws and teeth into his face , and clung to him so that they had to choke him off .
Parsing [sent. 7825 len. 23]: The chief caught up Mistress Conal and carried her away : there was no danger of any one hurting Mr. Palmer now !
Parsing [sent. 7826 len. 18]: He bore her on one arm like a child , and indeed she was not much heavier .
Parsing [sent. 7827 len. 53]: But she kept her face turned and her eyes fixed on her burning home , and leaning over the shoulder of the chief , poured out , as he carried her farther and farther from the scene of the outrage , a flood of maledictory prophecy against the doers of the deed .
Parsing [sent. 7828 len. 33]: The laird said never a word , never looked behind him , while she , almost tumbling down his back as she cursed with outstretched arms , deafened him with her raging .
Parsing [sent. 7829 len. 22]: He walked steadily down the path to the road , where he stepped into the midst of her goods and chattels .
Parsing [sent. 7830 len. 13]: The sight of them diverted a little the current of her wrath .
Parsing [sent. 7831 len. 9]: `` Where are you going , Macruadh ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7832 len. 8]: she cried , as he walked on .
Parsing [sent. 7833 len. 14]: `` See you not my property lying to the hand of the thief ?
Parsing [sent. 7834 len. 13]: Know you not that the greedy Sasunnach will sweep everything away ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7835 len. 14]: `` I ca n't carry them and you too , Mistress Conal ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7836 len. 5]: said the chief gayly .
Parsing [sent. 7837 len. 6]: `` Set me down then .
Parsing [sent. 7838 len. 8]: Who ever asked you to carry me !
Parsing [sent. 7839 len. 8]: And where would you be carrying me ?
Parsing [sent. 7840 len. 8]: My place is with my things ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7841 len. 10]: `` Your place is with me , Mistress Conal !
Parsing [sent. 7842 len. 22]: I belong to you , and you belong to me , and I am taking you home to my mother . ''
Parsing [sent. 7843 len. 31]: At the word , silence fell , not on the lips , but on the soul of the raving prophetess : the chief she loved , his mother she feared .
Parsing [sent. 7844 len. 8]: `` Set me down , Macruadh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7845 len. 6]: she pleaded in gentle tone .
Parsing [sent. 7846 len. 9]: `` Do n't carry me to her empty-handed !
Parsing [sent. 7847 len. 29]: Set me down straight ; I will load my back with my goods , and bear them to my lady , and throw them at her feet . ''
Parsing [sent. 7848 len. 37]: `` As soon as we get to the cottage , '' said the chief , striding on with his reluctant burden , `` I will send up two men with wheelbarrows to bring them home . ''
Parsing [sent. 7849 len. 7]: `` HOME , said you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7850 len. 25]: cried the old woman , and burst into the tearless wailing of a child ; `` there is a home for me no more !
Parsing [sent. 7851 len. 24]: My house was all that was left me of my people , and it is your own that make a house a home !
Parsing [sent. 7852 len. 52]: In the long winter nights , when I sat by the fire and heard the wind howl , and the snow pat , pat like the small hands of my little brothers on the window , my heart grew glad within me , and the dead came back to my soul !
Parsing [sent. 7853 len. 19]: When I took the book , I heard the spirit of my father reading through my own lips !
Parsing [sent. 7854 len. 6]: And oh , my mother !
Parsing [sent. 7855 len. 4]: my mother ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7856 len. 7]: She ceased as if in despair .
Parsing [sent. 7857 len. 15]: `` Surely , Nannie , you will be at home with your chief ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7858 len. 3]: said Alister .
Parsing [sent. 7859 len. 20]: `` My house is your house now , and your dead will come to it and be welcome ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7860 len. 13]: `` It is their chief 's house , and they will ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7861 len. 4]: she returned hopefully .
Parsing [sent. 7862 len. 6]: `` They loved their chief .
Parsing [sent. 7863 len. 17]: -- Shall we not make a fine clan when we 're all gathered , we Macmadhs !
Parsing [sent. 7864 len. 13]: Man nor woman can say I did anything to disgrace it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7865 len. 25]: `` Lest we should disgrace it , '' answered the chief , `` we must bear with patience what is sent upon it . ''
Parsing [sent. 7866 len. 56]: He carried her into the drawing-room and told her story , then stood , to the delighted amusement of his mother , with his little old sister in his arms , waiting her orders , like a big boy carrying the baby , who now and then moaned a little , but did not speak .
Parsing [sent. 7867 len. 51]: Mrs. Macruadh called Nancy , and told her to bring the tea-tray , and then , get ready for Mistress Conal the room next Nancy 's own , that she might be near to wait on her ; and thither , when warmed and fed , the chief carried her .
Parsing [sent. 7868 len. 18]: But the terrible excitement had so thinned the mainspring of her time-watch , that it soon broke .
Parsing [sent. 7869 len. 7]: She did not live many weeks .
Parsing [sent. 7870 len. 14]: From the first she sank into great dejection , and her mind wandered .
Parsing [sent. 7871 len. 38]: She said her father never came to see her now ; that he was displeased with her for leaving the house ; and that she knew now she ought to have stayed and been burned in it .
Parsing [sent. 7872 len. 17]: The chief reminded her that she had no choice , but had been carried bodily away .
Parsing [sent. 7873 len. 17]: `` Yes , yes , '' she answered ; `` but they do not know that !
Parsing [sent. 7874 len. 8]: I must make haste and tell them !
Parsing [sent. 7875 len. 12]: Who can bear her own people to think ill of her !
Parsing [sent. 7876 len. 5]: -- I 'm coming !
Parsing [sent. 7877 len. 4]: I 'm coming !
Parsing [sent. 7878 len. 8]: I 'll tell you all about it !
Parsing [sent. 7879 len. 8]: I 'm an honest woman yet ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7880 len. 18]: Another thing troubled her sorely , for which she would hear no consolation ; Blackie had vanished !
Parsing [sent. 7881 len. 74]: -- whether he was killed at the time of his onslaught on Mr. Palmer , or was afterwards shot ; whether , disgusted with the treatment of his old home , or the memory of what he had there suffered , he had fled the strath , and gone to the wild cats among the hills , or back to the place which some averred he came from , no one could tell .
Parsing [sent. 7882 len. 51]: In her wanderings she talked more of her cat than of anything else , and would say things that with some would have gone far to justify the belief that the animal was by nature on familiar terms with the element which had yet driven him from his temporary home .
Parsing [sent. 7883 len. 22]: Nancy was more than uneasy at having the witch so near , but by no means neglected her duty to her .
Parsing [sent. 7884 len. 33]: One night she woke , and had for some time lain listening whether she stirred or not , when suddenly quavered through the dark the most horrible cat-cry she had ever heard .
Parsing [sent. 7885 len. 12]: In abject terror she covered her head , and lay shuddering .
Parsing [sent. 7886 len. 18]: The cry came again , and kept coming at regular intervals , but drawing nearer and nearer .
Parsing [sent. 7887 len. 9]: Its expression was of intense and increasing pain .
Parsing [sent. 7888 len. 70]: The creature whence it issued seemed to come close to the house , then with difficulty to scramble up on the roof , where it went on yowling , and screeching , and throwing itself about as if tying itself in knots , Nancy said , until at last it gave a great choking , gobbling scream , and fell to the ground , after which all was quiet .
Parsing [sent. 7889 len. 18]: Persuading herself it was only a cat , she tried to sleep , and at length succeeded .
Parsing [sent. 7890 len. 31]: When she woke in the morning , the first thing she did was to go out , fully expecting to find the cat lying at the foot of the wall .
Parsing [sent. 7891 len. 5]: No cat was there .
Parsing [sent. 7892 len. 12]: She went then as usual to attend to the old woman .
Parsing [sent. 7893 len. 7]: Mistress Conal was dead and cold .
Parsing [sent. 7894 len. 17]: The clan followed her body to the grave , and the black cat was never seen .
Parsing [sent. 7895 len. 5]: CHAPTER IX THE MARCHES .
Parsing [sent. 7896 len. 15]: It was plainly of no use for the chief to attempt mollifying Mr. Palmer .
Parsing [sent. 7897 len. 38]: So long as it was possible for him to be what he was , it must be impossible for him to understand the conscience that compelled the chief to refuse participation in the results of his life .
Parsing [sent. 7898 len. 21]: Where a man 's own conscience is content , how shall he listen to the remonstrance of another man 's !
Parsing [sent. 7899 len. 43]: But even if he could have understood that the offence was unavoidable , that would rather have increased than diminished the pain of the hurt ; as it was , the chief 's determination must seem to Mr. Palmer an unprovoked insult !
Parsing [sent. 7900 len. 23]: Thus reflecting , Alister tried all he could to be fair to the man whom he had driven to cut his acquaintance .
Parsing [sent. 7901 len. 15]: It was now a lonely time for Alister , lonelier than any ever before .
Parsing [sent. 7902 len. 57]: Ian was not within reach even by letter ; Mercy was shut up from him : he had not seen or heard from her since writing his explanation ; and his mother did not sympathize with his dearest earthly desire : she would be greatly relieved , yea heartily glad , if Mercy was denied him !
Parsing [sent. 7903 len. 52]: She loved Ian more than the chief , yet could have better borne to see him the husband of Mercy ; what was wanting to the equality of her love was in this regard more than balanced by her respect for the chief of the clan and head of the family .
Parsing [sent. 7904 len. 38]: Alister 's light was thus left to burn in very darkness , that it might burn the better ; for as strength is made perfect through weakness , so does the light , within grow by darkness .
Parsing [sent. 7905 len. 14]: It was the people that sat in darkness that saw a great light .
Parsing [sent. 7906 len. 37]: He was brought closer than ever to first principles ; had to think and judge more than ever of the right thing to do -- first of all , the right thing with regard to Mercy .
Parsing [sent. 7907 len. 35]: Of giving her up , there was of course no thought ; so long as she would be his , he was hers as entirely as the bonds of any marriage could make him !
Parsing [sent. 7908 len. 8]: But she owed something to her father !
Parsing [sent. 7909 len. 20]: and of all men the patriarchal chief was the last to dare interfere with the RIGHTS of a father .
Parsing [sent. 7910 len. 16]: BUT THEY MUST BE RIGHTS , not rights turned into , or founded upon wrongs .
Parsing [sent. 7911 len. 22]: With the first in acknowledging true , he would not be with the last even , in yielding to false rights !
Parsing [sent. 7912 len. 12]: The question was , what were the rights of a father ?
Parsing [sent. 7913 len. 42]: One thing was clear , that it was the duty , therefore the right of a father , to prevent his child from giving herself away before she could know what she did ; and Mercy was not yet of age .
Parsing [sent. 7914 len. 26]: That one woman might be capable of knowing at fifteen , and another not at fifty , left untouched the necessity for fixing a limit .
Parsing [sent. 7915 len. 30]: It was his own duty and right , on the other hand , to do what he could to prevent her from being in any way deceived concerning him .
Parsing [sent. 7916 len. 34]: It was essential that nothing should be done , resolved , or yielded , by the girl , through any misunderstanding he could forestall , or because of any falsehood he could frustrate .
Parsing [sent. 7917 len. 11]: He must therefore contrive to hold some communication with her !
Parsing [sent. 7918 len. 14]: First of all , however , he must learn how she was treated !
Parsing [sent. 7919 len. 18]: It was not only in fiction or the ancient clan-histories that tyrannical and cruel things were done !
Parsing [sent. 7920 len. 47]: A tragedy is even more a tragedy that it has not much diversity of incident , that it is acted in commonplace surroundings , and that the agents of it are commonplace persons -- fathers and mothers acting from the best of low or selfish motives .
Parsing [sent. 7921 len. 29]: Where either Mammon or Society is worshipped , in love , longing , or fear , there is room for any falsehood , any cruelty , any suffering .
Parsing [sent. 7922 len. 62]: There were several of the clan employed about the New House of whom Alister might have sought information ; but he was of another construction from the man of fashion in the old plays , whose first love-strategy is always to bribe the lady 's maid : the chief scorned to learn anything through those of a man 's own household .
Parsing [sent. 7923 len. 51]: He fired a gun , and ran up a flag on the old castle , which brought Rob of the Angels at full speed , and comforted the heart of Mercy sitting disconsolate at her window : it was her chiefs doing , and might have to do with her !
Parsing [sent. 7924 len. 32]: Having told Rob the state of matters between him and the New House -- `` I need not desire you , Rob , '' he concluded , `` to be silent !
Parsing [sent. 7925 len. 15]: You may of course let your father know , but never a soul besides .
Parsing [sent. 7926 len. 27]: From this moment , every hour your father does not actually need you , be somewhere on the hills where you can see the New House .
Parsing [sent. 7927 len. 12]: I want to learn first whether she goes out at all .
Parsing [sent. 7928 len. 10]: With the dark you must draw nearer the house .
Parsing [sent. 7929 len. 39]: But I will have no questioning of the servants or anyone employed about it ; I will never use a man 's pay to thwart his plans , nor yet make any man even unconsciously a traitor . ''
Parsing [sent. 7930 len. 21]: Rob understood and departed ; but before he had news for his master an event occurred which superseded his service .
Parsing [sent. 7931 len. 30]: The neighbours , Mr. Peregrine Palmer and Mr. Brander , had begun to enclose their joint estates for a deer-forest , and had engaged men to act as curators .
Parsing [sent. 7932 len. 49]: They were from the neighbourhood , but none of them belonged to Strathruadh , and not one knew the boundaries of the district they had to patrol ; nor indeed were the boundaries everywhere precisely determined : why should they be , where all was heather and rock ?
Parsing [sent. 7933 len. 34]: Until game-sprinkled space grew valuable , who would care whether this or that lump of limestone , rooted in the solid earth , were the actual property of the one or the other !
Parsing [sent. 7934 len. 13]: Either would make the other welcome to blast and cart it away !
Parsing [sent. 7935 len. 50]: There was just one person who knew all about the boundaries that was to be known ; he could not in places draw their lines with absolute assurance , but he had better grounds for his conclusions than anyone else could have ; this was Hector of the Stags .
Parsing [sent. 7936 len. 25]: For who so likely to understand them as he who knew the surface within them as well as the clay-floor of his own hut ?
Parsing [sent. 7937 len. 22]: If he did not everywhere know where the marchline fell , at least he knew perfectly where it ought to fall .
Parsing [sent. 7938 len. 105]: It happened just at this time that THE MISTRESS told Hector she would be glad of a deer , intending to cure part for winter use ; the next day , therefore , -- the first of Rob of the Angels ' secret service -- he stalked one across the hill-farm , got a shot at it near the cave-house , brought it down , and was busy breaking it , when two men who had come creeping up behind , threw themselves upon him , and managed , well for themselves , to secure him before he had a chance of defending himself .
Parsing [sent. 7939 len. 66]: Finding he was deaf and dumb , one of them knew who he must be , and would have let him go ; but the other , eager to ingratiate himself with the new laird , used such , argument to the contrary as prevailed with his companion , and they set out for the New House , Hector between them with his hands tied .
Parsing [sent. 7940 len. 22]: Annoyed and angry at being thus treated like a malefactor , he yet found amusement in the notion of their mistake .
Parsing [sent. 7941 len. 20]: But he found it awkward to be unable to use that readiest weapon of human defence , the tongue .
Parsing [sent. 7942 len. 21]: If only his EARS AND MOUTH , as he called Rob in their own speech , had been with him !
Parsing [sent. 7943 len. 36]: When he saw , however , where they were taking him , he was comforted , for Rob was almost certain to see him : wherever he was , he was watching the New House !
Parsing [sent. 7944 len. 17]: He went composedly along with them therefore , fuming and snorting , not caring to escape .
Parsing [sent. 7945 len. 23]: When Rob caught sight of the three , he could not think how it was that his father walked so unlike himself .
Parsing [sent. 7946 len. 31]: He could not be hurt , for his step was strong and steady as ever ; not the less was there something of the rhythm gone out of his motion !
Parsing [sent. 7947 len. 11]: there was `` a broken music '' in his gait !
Parsing [sent. 7948 len. 17]: He took the telescope which the chief had lent him , and turned it upon him .
Parsing [sent. 7949 len. 24]: Discovering then that his father 's hands were bound behind his back , fiercest indignation overwhelmed the soul of Rob of the Angels .
Parsing [sent. 7950 len. 7]: His father bound like a criminal !
Parsing [sent. 7951 len. 9]: -- his father , the best of men !
Parsing [sent. 7952 len. 6]: What could the devils mean ?
Parsing [sent. 7953 len. 11]: Ah , they were taking him to the New House !
Parsing [sent. 7954 len. 29]: He shut up his telescope , laid it down by a stone , and bounded to meet them , sharpening his knife on his hand as he went .
Parsing [sent. 7955 len. 40]: The moment they were near enough , signs , unintelligible to the keepers , began to pass between the father and son : Rob 's meant that he must let him pass unnoticed ; Hector 's that he understood .
Parsing [sent. 7956 len. 15]: So , with but the usual salutation of a stranger , Rob passed them .
Parsing [sent. 7957 len. 22]: The same moment he turned , and with one swift sweep of his knife , severed the bonds of his father .
Parsing [sent. 7958 len. 15]: The old man stepped back , and father and son stood fronting the enemy .
Parsing [sent. 7959 len. 18]: `` Now , '' said Eob , `` if you are honest men , stand to it !
Parsing [sent. 7960 len. 10]: How dared you bind Hector of the Stags ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7961 len. 15]: `` Because he is not an honest man , '' replied one of them .
Parsing [sent. 7962 len. 7]: Rob answered him with a blow .
Parsing [sent. 7963 len. 11]: The man made at him , but Hector stepped between .
Parsing [sent. 7964 len. 31]: `` Say that again of my father , '' cried Rob , `` who has no speech to defend himself , and I will drive my knife into you . ''
Parsing [sent. 7965 len. 9]: `` We are only doing our duty ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7966 len. 4]: said the other .
Parsing [sent. 7967 len. 22]: `` We came upon him there cutting up the deer he had just killed on the new laird 's land . ''
Parsing [sent. 7968 len. 18]: `` Who are you to say which is the stranger 's , and which the Macruadh 's ?
Parsing [sent. 7969 len. 16]: Neither my father nor I have ever seen the faces of you in the country !
Parsing [sent. 7970 len. 33]: Will you pretend to know the marches better than my father , who was born and bred in the heather , and knows every stone on the face of the hills ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7971 len. 14]: `` We ca n't help where he was born or what he knows !
Parsing [sent. 7972 len. 7]: he was on our land ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7973 len. 15]: `` He is the Macruadh 's keeper , and was on his own land .
Parsing [sent. 7974 len. 8]: You will get yourselves into trouble ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7975 len. 8]: `` We 'll take our chance ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7976 len. 7]: `` Take your man then ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7977 len. 40]: `` If he try to escape , I swear by the bones of my grandfather , '' said the more inimical of the two , inheritor of a clan-feud with the Macruadhs , `` I will shoot him . ''
Parsing [sent. 7978 len. 10]: Bob of the Angels burst into a scornful laugh .
Parsing [sent. 7979 len. 4]: `` You will !
Parsing [sent. 7980 len. 4]: will you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7981 len. 17]: `` I will not kill him ; I do n't want to be hanged for him !
Parsing [sent. 7982 len. 12]: but I will empty my shot-barrel into the legs of him !
Parsing [sent. 7983 len. 10]: So take your chance ; you are warned ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7984 len. 15]: They had Hector 's gun , and Rob had no weapon but his knife .
Parsing [sent. 7985 len. 14]: Nor was he inclined to use either now he had cooled a little .
Parsing [sent. 7986 len. 6]: He turned to his father .
Parsing [sent. 7987 len. 38]: The old man understood perfectly what had passed between them , and signed to Rob that he would go on to the New House , and Rob might run and let the chief know what had happened .
Parsing [sent. 7988 len. 30]: The same thing was in Rob 's mind , for he saw how it would favour the desires of his chief , bringing them all naturally about the place .
Parsing [sent. 7989 len. 15]: But he must first go with his father on the chance of learning something .
Parsing [sent. 7990 len. 11]: `` We will go with you , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 7991 len. 8]: `` We do n't want YOU ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7992 len. 7]: `` But I mean to go !
Parsing [sent. 7993 len. 12]: -- My father is not able to speak for himself ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7994 len. 6]: `` You know nothing . ''
Parsing [sent. 7995 len. 7]: `` I know what he knows .
Parsing [sent. 7996 len. 10]: The lie does not grow in our strath . ''
Parsing [sent. 7997 len. 9]: `` You crow high , my cock ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7998 len. 11]: `` No higher than I strike , '' answered Rob .
Parsing [sent. 7999 len. 40]: In the eyes of the men Rob was small and weak ; but there was something in him notwithstanding that looked dangerous , and , though far from cowards , they thought it as well to leave him alone .
Parsing [sent. 8000 len. 48]: Mercy at her window , where was her usual seat now , saw them coming , and instinctively connected their appearance with her father 's new measures of protection ; and when the men turned toward the kitchen , she ran down to learn what she could .
Parsing [sent. 8001 len. 10]: Rob greeted her with a smile as he entered .
Parsing [sent. 8002 len. 19]: `` I am going to fetch the Macruadh , '' he whispered , and turning went out again .
Parsing [sent. 8003 len. 20]: He told the chief that at the word her face lighted up as with the rise of the moon .
Parsing [sent. 8004 len. 19]: One of the maids went and told her master that they had got a poacher in the kitchen .
Parsing [sent. 8005 len. 24]: Mr. Palmer 's eyes lightened under his black brows when he saw the captive , whom he knew by sight and by report .
Parsing [sent. 8006 len. 28]: His men told him the story their own way , never hinting a doubt as to whose was the land on which the deer had been killed .
Parsing [sent. 8007 len. 8]: `` Where is the nearest magistrate ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8008 len. 6]: he inquired with grand severity .
Parsing [sent. 8009 len. 10]: `` The nearest is the Macruadh , sir ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8010 len. 18]: answered a highlander who had come from work in the garden to see what was going on .
Parsing [sent. 8011 len. 18]: `` I can not apply to him ; the fellow is one of his own men ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8012 len. 9]: `` The Macruadh does what is just ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8013 len. 4]: rejoined the man .
Parsing [sent. 8014 len. 7]: His master vouchsafed him no reply .
Parsing [sent. 8015 len. 15]: He would not show his wrath against the chief : it would be undignified !
Parsing [sent. 8016 len. 20]: `` Take him to the tool-house , and lock him up till I think what to do with him .
Parsing [sent. 8017 len. 6]: Bring me the key . ''
Parsing [sent. 8018 len. 13]: The butler led the way , and Hector followed between his captors .
Parsing [sent. 8019 len. 28]: They might have been showing him to his bed-room , so calm was he : Bob gone to fetch the chief , his imprisonment could not last !
Parsing [sent. 8020 len. 13]: -- and for the indignity , was he not in the right !
Parsing [sent. 8021 len. 13]: As Mr. Palmer left the kitchen , his eye fell on Mercy .
Parsing [sent. 8022 len. 16]: `` Go to your room , '' he said angrily , and turned from her .
Parsing [sent. 8023 len. 20]: She obeyed in silence , consoling herself that from her window she could see the arrival of the chief .
Parsing [sent. 8024 len. 16]: Nor had she watched long when she saw him coming along the road with Rob .
Parsing [sent. 8025 len. 9]: At the gate she lost sight of them .
Parsing [sent. 8026 len. 18]: Presently she heard voices in the hall , and crept down the stair far enough to hear .
Parsing [sent. 8027 len. 22]: `` I could commit you for a breach of the peace , Mr. Palmer , '' she heard the chief say .
Parsing [sent. 8028 len. 11]: `` You ought to have brought the man to me .
Parsing [sent. 8029 len. 8]: As a magistrate I order his release .
Parsing [sent. 8030 len. 14]: But I give my word he shall be forthcoming when legally required . ''
Parsing [sent. 8031 len. 7]: `` Your word is no bail .
Parsing [sent. 8032 len. 17]: The man was taken poaching ; I have him , and I will keep him . ''
Parsing [sent. 8033 len. 20]: `` Let me see him then , that I may learn from himself where he shot the deer . ''
Parsing [sent. 8034 len. 9]: `` He shall go before Mr. Brander . ''
Parsing [sent. 8035 len. 11]: `` Then I beg you will take him at once .
Parsing [sent. 8036 len. 6]: I will go with him .
Parsing [sent. 8037 len. 8]: But listen a moment , Mr. Palmer .
Parsing [sent. 8038 len. 22]: When this same man , my keeper , took your guest poaching on my ground , I let Mr. Sercombe go .
Parsing [sent. 8039 len. 11]: I could have committed him as you would commit Hector .
Parsing [sent. 8040 len. 10]: I ask you in return to let Hector go .
Parsing [sent. 8041 len. 22]: Being deaf and dumb , and the hills the joy of his life , confinement will be terrible to him . ''
Parsing [sent. 8042 len. 9]: `` I will do nothing of the kind .
Parsing [sent. 8043 len. 11]: You could never have committed a gentleman for a mistake .
Parsing [sent. 8044 len. 8]: This is quite a different thing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8045 len. 16]: `` It is a different thing , for Hector can not have made a mistake .
Parsing [sent. 8046 len. 16]: He could not have followed a deer on to your ground without knowing it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8047 len. 9]: `` I make no question of that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8048 len. 11]: `` He says he was not on your property . ''
Parsing [sent. 8049 len. 4]: `` Says ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8050 len. 10]: `` He is not a man to lie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8051 len. 4]: Mr. Palmer smiled .
Parsing [sent. 8052 len. 14]: `` Once more I pray you , let us see him together . ''
Parsing [sent. 8053 len. 8]: `` You shall not see him . ''
Parsing [sent. 8054 len. 11]: `` Then take him at once before Mr. Brander . ''
Parsing [sent. 8055 len. 9]: `` Mr. Brander is not at home . ''
Parsing [sent. 8056 len. 12]: `` Take him before SOME magistrate -- I care not who .
Parsing [sent. 8057 len. 6]: There is Mr. Chisholm ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8058 len. 13]: `` I will take him when and where it suits me . ''
Parsing [sent. 8059 len. 12]: `` Then as a magistrate I will set him at liberty .
Parsing [sent. 8060 len. 10]: I am sorry to make myself unpleasant to you .
Parsing [sent. 8061 len. 9]: Of all things I would have avoided it .
Parsing [sent. 8062 len. 10]: But I can not let the man suffer unjustly .
Parsing [sent. 8063 len. 7]: Where have you put him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8064 len. 9]: `` Where you will not find him . ''
Parsing [sent. 8065 len. 14]: `` He is one of my people ; I must have him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8066 len. 4]: `` Your people !
Parsing [sent. 8067 len. 8]: A set of idle , poaching fellows !
Parsing [sent. 8068 len. 20]: By heaven , the strath shall be rid of the pack of them before another year is out ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8069 len. 24]: `` While I have land in it with room for them to stand upon , the strath shall not be rid of them !
Parsing [sent. 8070 len. 6]: -- But this is idle !
Parsing [sent. 8071 len. 10]: Where have you put Hector of the Stags ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8072 len. 4]: Mr. Palmer laughed .
Parsing [sent. 8073 len. 5]: `` In safe keeping .
Parsing [sent. 8074 len. 10]: There is no occasion to be uneasy about him !
Parsing [sent. 8075 len. 28]: He shall have plenty to eat and drink , be well punished , and show the rest of the rascals the way out of the country ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8076 len. 7]: `` Then I must find him !
Parsing [sent. 8077 len. 5]: You compel me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8078 len. 30]: So saying , the chief , with intent to begin his search at the top of the house in the hope of seeing Mercy , darted up the stair .
Parsing [sent. 8079 len. 14]: She heard him coming , went a few steps higher , and waited .
Parsing [sent. 8080 len. 13]: On the landing he saw her , white , with flashing eyes .
Parsing [sent. 8081 len. 22]: Their hands clasped each other -- for a moment only , but the moment was of eternity , not of time .
Parsing [sent. 8082 len. 14]: `` You will find Hector in the tool-house , '' she said aloud .
Parsing [sent. 8083 len. 6]: `` You shameless hussey ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8084 len. 11]: cried her father , following the chief in a fury .
Parsing [sent. 8085 len. 6]: Mercy ran up the stair .
Parsing [sent. 8086 len. 8]: The chief turned and faced Mr. Palmer .
Parsing [sent. 8087 len. 10]: `` You have no business in my house ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8088 len. 10]: `` I have the right of a magistrate . ''
Parsing [sent. 8089 len. 6]: `` You have no right .
Parsing [sent. 8090 len. 6]: Leave it at once . ''
Parsing [sent. 8091 len. 7]: `` Allow me to pass . ''
Parsing [sent. 8092 len. 20]: `` You ought to be ashamed of yourself -- making a girl turn traitor to her own father ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8093 len. 20]: `` You ought to be proud of a daughter with the conscience and courage to turn against you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8094 len. 36]: The chief passed Mr. Palmer , and running down the stair , joined Rob of the Angels where he stood at the door in a group composed of the keepers and most of the servants .
Parsing [sent. 8095 len. 8]: `` Do you know the tool-house ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8096 len. 5]: he said to Rob .
Parsing [sent. 8097 len. 6]: `` Yes , Macruadh . ''
Parsing [sent. 8098 len. 6]: `` Lead the way then .
Parsing [sent. 8099 len. 6]: Your father is there . ''
Parsing [sent. 8100 len. 15]: `` On no account let them open the door , '' cried Mr. Palmer .
Parsing [sent. 8101 len. 12]: `` They may hold through it what communication they please . ''
Parsing [sent. 8102 len. 16]: `` You will not be saying much to a deaf man through inch boards ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8103 len. 7]: remarked the clansman from the garden .
Parsing [sent. 8104 len. 11]: Mr. Palmer hurried after them , and his men followed .
Parsing [sent. 8105 len. 11]: Alister found the door fast and solid , without handle .
Parsing [sent. 8106 len. 19]: He turned a look on his companion , and was about to run his weight against the lock .
Parsing [sent. 8107 len. 10]: `` It is too strong , '' said Rob .
Parsing [sent. 8108 len. 10]: `` Hector of the Stags must open it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8109 len. 4]: `` But how ?
Parsing [sent. 8110 len. 12]: You can not even let him know what you want ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8111 len. 35]: Rob gave a smile , and going up to the door , laid himself against it , as close as he could stand , with his face upon it , and so stood silent .
Parsing [sent. 8112 len. 33]: Mr. Palmer coming up with his attendants , all stood for a few moments in silence , wondering at Rob : he must be holding communication with his father -- but how ?
Parsing [sent. 8113 len. 18]: Sounds began inside -- first a tumbling of tools about , then an attack on the lock .
Parsing [sent. 8114 len. 3]: `` Come !
Parsing [sent. 8115 len. 2]: come !
Parsing [sent. 8116 len. 6]: this wo n't do ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8117 len. 8]: said Mr. Palmer , approaching the door .
Parsing [sent. 8118 len. 10]: `` Prevent it then , '' said the chief .
Parsing [sent. 8119 len. 27]: `` Do what you will you can not make him hear you , and while the door is between you , he can not see you !
Parsing [sent. 8120 len. 11]: If you do not open it , he will ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8121 len. 21]: `` Run , '' said Mr. Palmer to the butler ; `` you will find the key on my table !
Parsing [sent. 8122 len. 9]: I do n't want the lock ruined ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8123 len. 8]: But there was no stopping the thing !
Parsing [sent. 8124 len. 35]: Before the butler came back , the lock fell , the door opened , and out came Hector , wiping his brow with his sleeve , and looking as if he enjoyed the fun .
Parsing [sent. 8125 len. 5]: The keepers darted forward .
Parsing [sent. 8126 len. 5]: `` Stand off ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8127 len. 6]: said the chief stepping between .
Parsing [sent. 8128 len. 23]: `` I do n't want to hurt you , but if you attempt to lay hands on him , I will . ''
Parsing [sent. 8129 len. 25]: One of the men dodged round , and laid hold of Hector from behind ; the other made a move towards him in front .
Parsing [sent. 8130 len. 47]: Hector stood motionless for an instant , watching his chief , but when he saw him knock down the man before him , he had his own assailant by the throat in an instant , gave him a shake , and threw him beside his companion .
Parsing [sent. 8131 len. 10]: `` You shall suffer for this , Macruadh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8132 len. 25]: cried Mr. Palmer , coming close up to him , and speaking in a low , determined tone , carrying a conviction of unchangeableness .
Parsing [sent. 8133 len. 12]: `` Better leave what may not be the worst alone ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8134 len. 4]: returned the chief .
Parsing [sent. 8135 len. 44]: `` It is of no use telling you how sorry I am to have to make myself disagreeable to you ; but I give you fair warning that I will accept no refusal of the hand of your daughter from any but herself .
Parsing [sent. 8136 len. 47]: As you have chosen to break with me , I accept your declaration of war , and tell you plainly I will do all I can to win your daughter , never asking your leave in respect of anything I may think it well to do .
Parsing [sent. 8137 len. 13]: You will find there are stronger forces in the world than money .
Parsing [sent. 8138 len. 21]: Henceforward I hold myself clear of any personal obligation to you except as Mercy 's father and my enemy . ''
Parsing [sent. 8139 len. 11]: From very rage Mr. Palmer was incapable of answering him .
Parsing [sent. 8140 len. 22]: Alister turned from him , and in his excitement mechanically followed Rob , who was turning a corner of the house .
Parsing [sent. 8141 len. 33]: It was not the way to the gate , but Rob had seen Mercy peeping round that same corner -- anxious in truth about her father ; she feared nothing for Alister .
Parsing [sent. 8142 len. 11]: He came at once upon Mercy and Rob talking together .
Parsing [sent. 8143 len. 26]: Rob withdrew and joined his father a little way off ; they retired a few more paces , and stood waiting their chief 's orders .
Parsing [sent. 8144 len. 12]: `` How AM I to see you again , Mercy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8145 len. 5]: said the chief hurriedly .
Parsing [sent. 8146 len. 9]: `` Ca n't you think of some way ?
Parsing [sent. 8147 len. 4]: Think quick . ''
Parsing [sent. 8148 len. 58]: Now Mercy , as she sat alone at her window , had not unfrequently imagined the chief standing below on the walk , or just beyond in the belt of shrubbery ; and now once more in her mind 's eye suddenly seeing him there , she answered hurriedly , `` Come under my window to-night . ''
Parsing [sent. 8149 len. 10]: `` I do not know which it is . ''
Parsing [sent. 8150 len. 8]: `` You see it from the castle .
Parsing [sent. 8151 len. 9]: I will put a candle in it . ''
Parsing [sent. 8152 len. 5]: `` What hour ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8153 len. 6]: `` ANY time after midnight .
Parsing [sent. 8154 len. 9]: I will sit there till you come . ''
Parsing [sent. 8155 len. 15]: `` Thank you , '' said the chief , and departed with his attendants .
Parsing [sent. 8156 len. 21]: Mercy hastened into the house by a back door , but had to cross the hall to reach the stair .
Parsing [sent. 8157 len. 21]: As she ran up , her father came in at the front door , saw her , and called her .
Parsing [sent. 8158 len. 21]: She went down again to meet the tempest of his rage , which now broke upon her in gathered fury .
Parsing [sent. 8159 len. 21]: He called her a treacherous , unnatural child , with every name he thought bad enough to characterize her conduct .
Parsing [sent. 8160 len. 20]: Had she been to him as Began or Goneril , he could hardly have found worse names for her .
Parsing [sent. 8161 len. 11]: She stood pale , but looked him in the face .
Parsing [sent. 8162 len. 20]: Her mother came trembling as near as she dared , withered by her terror to almost twice her age .
Parsing [sent. 8163 len. 17]: Mr. Palmer in his fury took a step towards Mercy as if he would strike her .
Parsing [sent. 8164 len. 14]: Mercy did not move a muscle , but stood ready for the blow .
Parsing [sent. 8165 len. 37]: Then love overcame her fear , and the wife and mother threw herself between , her arms round her husband , as if rather to protect him from the deed than her daughter from its hurt .
Parsing [sent. 8166 len. 12]: `` Go to your room , Mercy , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 8167 len. 5]: Mercy turned and went .
Parsing [sent. 8168 len. 6]: She could not understand herself .
Parsing [sent. 8169 len. 34]: She used to be afraid of her father when she knew no reason ; now that all the bad in his nature and breeding took form and utterance , she found herself calm !
Parsing [sent. 8170 len. 19]: But the thing that quieted her was in reality her sorrow that he should carry himself so wildly .
Parsing [sent. 8171 len. 35]: What she thought was , if the mere sense of not being in the wrong made one able to endure so much , what must not the truth 's sake enable one to bear !
Parsing [sent. 8172 len. 11]: She sat down at her window to gaze and brood .
Parsing [sent. 8173 len. 29]: When her father cooled down , he was annoyed with himself , not that he had been unjust , but that he had behaved with so little dignity .
Parsing [sent. 8174 len. 21]: With brows black as evil , he sat degraded in his own eyes , resenting the degradation on his daughter .
Parsing [sent. 8175 len. 14]: Every time he thought of her , new rage arose in his heart .
Parsing [sent. 8176 len. 9]: He had been proud of his family autocracy .
Parsing [sent. 8177 len. 26]: So seldom had it been necessary to enforce his authority , that he never doubted his wishes had but to be known to be obeyed .
Parsing [sent. 8178 len. 16]: Born tyrannical , the characterless submission of his wife had nourished the tyrannical in him .
Parsing [sent. 8179 len. 66]: Now , all at once , a daughter , the ugly one , from whom no credit was to be looked for , dared to defy him for a clown figuring in a worn-out rag of chieftainship -- the musty fiction of a clan -- half a dozen shepherds , crofters , weavers , and shoemakers , not the shadow of a gentleman among them !
Parsing [sent. 8180 len. 33]: -- a man who ate brose , went with bare knees , worked like any hind , and did not dare offend his wretched relations by calling his paltry farm his own !
Parsing [sent. 8181 len. 35]: -- for the sake of such a fellow , with a highland twang that disgusted his fastidious ear , his own daughter made a mock of his authority , treated him as a nobody !
Parsing [sent. 8182 len. 20]: In his own house she had risen against him , and betrayed him to the insults of his enemy !
Parsing [sent. 8183 len. 25]: His conscious importance , partly from doubt in itself , boiled and fumed , bubbled and steamed in the caldron of his angry brain .
Parsing [sent. 8184 len. 14]: Not one , but many suns would go down upon such a wrath !
Parsing [sent. 8185 len. 14]: `` I wish I might never set eyes on the girl again ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8186 len. 6]: he said to his wife .
Parsing [sent. 8187 len. 18]: `` A small enough loss the sight of her would be , the ugly , common-looking thing !
Parsing [sent. 8188 len. 16]: I beg you will save me from it in future as much as you can .
Parsing [sent. 8189 len. 14]: She makes me feel as if I should go out of my mind !
Parsing [sent. 8190 len. 6]: -- so calm , forsooth !
Parsing [sent. 8191 len. 3]: so meek !
Parsing [sent. 8192 len. 3]: so self-sufficient !
Parsing [sent. 8193 len. 7]: -- oh , quite a saint !
Parsing [sent. 8194 len. 5]: -- and so strong-minded !
Parsing [sent. 8195 len. 19]: -- equal to throwing her father over for a fellow she never saw till a year ago ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8196 len. 21]: `` She shall have her dinner sent up to her as usual , '' answered his wife with a sigh .
Parsing [sent. 8197 len. 15]: `` But , really , Peregrine , my dear , you must compose yourself !
Parsing [sent. 8198 len. 10]: Love has driven many a woman to extremes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8199 len. 3]: `` Love !
Parsing [sent. 8200 len. 8]: Why should she love such a fellow ?
Parsing [sent. 8201 len. 8]: I see nothing in him to love !
Parsing [sent. 8202 len. 6]: WHY should she love him ?
Parsing [sent. 8203 len. 4]: Tell me that !
Parsing [sent. 8204 len. 20]: Give me one good reason for her folly , and I will forgive her -- do anything for her !
Parsing [sent. 8205 len. 9]: -- anything but let her have the rascal !
Parsing [sent. 8206 len. 5]: That I WILL NOT !
Parsing [sent. 8207 len. 20]: Take for your son-in-law an ape that loathes your money , calls it filthy lucre -- and means it !
Parsing [sent. 8208 len. 7]: Not if I can help it !
Parsing [sent. 8209 len. 8]: -- Do n't let me see her !
Parsing [sent. 8210 len. 7]: I shall come to hate her !
Parsing [sent. 8211 len. 17]: and that I would rather not ; a man must love and cherish his own flesh !
Parsing [sent. 8212 len. 8]: I shall go away , I must !
Parsing [sent. 8213 len. 23]: -- to get rid of the hateful face of the minx , with its selfrighteous , injured look staring at you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8214 len. 18]: `` If you do , you ca n't expect me to prevent her from seeing him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8215 len. 14]: `` Lock her up in the coal-hole -- bury her if you like !
Parsing [sent. 8216 len. 11]: I shall never ask what you have done with her !
Parsing [sent. 8217 len. 12]: Never to see her again is all I care about ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8218 len. 22]: `` Ah , if she were really dead , you would want to see her again -- after a while ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8219 len. 17]: `` I wish then she was dead , that I might want to see her again !
Parsing [sent. 8220 len. 6]: It wo n't be sooner !
Parsing [sent. 8221 len. 20]: Ten times rather than know her married to that beast , I would see her dead and buried ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8222 len. 6]: The mother held her peace .
Parsing [sent. 8223 len. 11]: He did not mean it , she said to herself .
Parsing [sent. 8224 len. 6]: It was only his anger !
Parsing [sent. 8225 len. 22]: But he did mean it ; at that moment he would with joy have heard the earth fall on her coffin .
Parsing [sent. 8226 len. 40]: Notwithstanding her faculty for shutting out the painful , her persistent self-assuring that it would blow over , and her confidence that things would by and by resume their course , Mrs. Palmer was in those days very unhappy .
Parsing [sent. 8227 len. 26]: The former quiet once restored , she would take Mercy in hand , and reasoning with her , soon persuade her to what she pleased !
Parsing [sent. 8228 len. 13]: It was her husband 's severity that had brought it to this !
Parsing [sent. 8229 len. 50]: The accomplice of her husband , she did not understand that influence works only between such as inhabit the same spiritual sphere : the daughter had been lifted into a region far above all the arguments of her mother -- arguments poor in life , and base in reach .
Parsing [sent. 8230 len. 4]: CHAPTER X MIDNIGHT .
Parsing [sent. 8231 len. 10]: Mercy sat alone but not lonely at her window .
Parsing [sent. 8232 len. 15]: A joy in her heart made her independent for the time of human intercourse .
Parsing [sent. 8233 len. 20]: Life at the moment was livable without it , for there was no bar between her and her lover .
Parsing [sent. 8234 len. 5]: The evening drew on .
Parsing [sent. 8235 len. 5]: They sent her food .
Parsing [sent. 8236 len. 25]: She forgot to eat it , and sat looking , till the lines of the horizon seemed grown into her mind like an etching .
Parsing [sent. 8237 len. 29]: She watched the slow dusk swell and gather -- with such delicate , soft-blending gradations in the birth of night as Edwin Waugh loves to seize and word-paint .
Parsing [sent. 8238 len. 42]: Through all its fine evanescent change of thought and feeling she watched unconsciously ; and the growth , death , and burial of that twilight were ever after a substratum to all the sadness and all the hope that visited her .
Parsing [sent. 8239 len. 56]: Through palest eastern rose , through silvery gold and golden green and brown , the daylight passed into the shadow of the light , and the stars , like hope in despair , began to show themselves where they always were , and the night came on , and deeper and deeper sank the silence .
Parsing [sent. 8240 len. 12]: Household sound expired , and no step came near her door .
Parsing [sent. 8241 len. 10]: Her father had given orders , and was obeyed .
Parsing [sent. 8242 len. 36]: Christina has stolen indeed from her own room and listened at hers , but hearing nor sound nor motion , had concluded it better for Mercy as well as safer for herself , to return .
Parsing [sent. 8243 len. 17]: So she sat the sole wakeful thing in the house , for even her father slept .
Parsing [sent. 8244 len. 17]: The earth had grown vague and dim , looking as it must look to the dead .
Parsing [sent. 8245 len. 23]: Its oppressive solidity , its obtrusive HERENESS , dissolved in the dark , it left the soul to live its own life .
Parsing [sent. 8246 len. 45]: She could still trace the meeting of earth and sky , each the evidence of the other , but the earth was content to be and not assert , and the sky lived only in the points of light that dotted its vaulted quiet .
Parsing [sent. 8247 len. 16]: Sound itself seemed asleep , and filling the air with the repose of its slumber .
Parsing [sent. 8248 len. 61]: Absolute silence the soul can not grasp ; therefore deepest silence seems ever , in Wordsworth 's lovely phrase , wandering into sound , for silence is but the thin shadow of harmony -- say rather creation 's ear agape for sound , the waiting matrix of interwoven melodies , the sphere-bowl standing empty for the wine of the spirit .
Parsing [sent. 8249 len. 47]: There may be yet another reason beyond its too great depth or height or strength , why we should be deaf to the spheral music ; it may be that the absolute perfection of its harmony can take to our ears but the shape of silence .
Parsing [sent. 8250 len. 8]: Content and patient , Mercy sat watching .
Parsing [sent. 8251 len. 31]: It was just past midnight , but she had not yet lighted a candle , when something struck the window as with the soft blow of a moth 's wing .
Parsing [sent. 8252 len. 7]: Her heart gave a great leap .
Parsing [sent. 8253 len. 4]: She listened breathless .
Parsing [sent. 8254 len. 3]: Nothing followed .
Parsing [sent. 8255 len. 19]: It must have been some flying night-thing , though surely too late in the year for a moth !
Parsing [sent. 8256 len. 4]: It came again !
Parsing [sent. 8257 len. 5]: She dared not speak .
Parsing [sent. 8258 len. 6]: She softly opened the window .
Parsing [sent. 8259 len. 22]: The darkness had thinned on the horizon , and the half-moon was lifting a corner above the edge of the world .
Parsing [sent. 8260 len. 27]: Something in the shrubbery answered her shine , and without rustle of branch , quiet as a ghost , the chief stepped into the open space .
Parsing [sent. 8261 len. 10]: Mercy leaned toward him and said , `` Hush !
Parsing [sent. 8262 len. 4]: speak low . ''
Parsing [sent. 8263 len. 14]: `` There is no need to say much , '' he answered . ''
Parsing [sent. 8264 len. 19]: I come only to tell you that , as man may , I am with you always . ''
Parsing [sent. 8265 len. 6]: `` How quietly you came !
Parsing [sent. 8266 len. 8]: I did not hear a sound ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8267 len. 12]: `` I have been two hours here in the shrubbery . ''
Parsing [sent. 8268 len. 9]: `` And I not once to suspect it !
Parsing [sent. 8269 len. 8]: You might have given me some hint !
Parsing [sent. 8270 len. 9]: A very small one would have been enough !
Parsing [sent. 8271 len. 9]: Why did you not let me know ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8272 len. 20]: `` It was not your hour ; it is twelve but now ; the moon comes to say so .
Parsing [sent. 8273 len. 38]: I came for the luxury of expectation , and the delight of knowing you better attended than you thought : you knew me with you in spirit ; I was with you in the body too ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8274 len. 5]: `` My chief ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8275 len. 4]: she said softly .
Parsing [sent. 8276 len. 16]: `` I shall always find you nearer and better than I was able to think !
Parsing [sent. 8277 len. 12]: I know I do not know how good you are . ''
Parsing [sent. 8278 len. 9]: `` I am good toward you , Mercy !
Parsing [sent. 8279 len. 5]: I love you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8280 len. 11]: A long silence , save of shining eyes , followed .
Parsing [sent. 8281 len. 8]: `` We are waiting for God ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8282 len. 5]: said Alister at length .
Parsing [sent. 8283 len. 9]: `` Waiting is loving , '' answered Mercy .
Parsing [sent. 8284 len. 10]: She leaned out , looking down to her heaven .
Parsing [sent. 8285 len. 14]: The moon had been climbing the sky , veiled in a little cloud .
Parsing [sent. 8286 len. 12]: The cloud vanished , and her light fell on the chief .
Parsing [sent. 8287 len. 9]: `` Have you been to a ball ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8288 len. 3]: said Mercy .
Parsing [sent. 8289 len. 5]: `` No , Mercy .
Parsing [sent. 8290 len. 13]: I doubt if there will be any dancing more in Strathruadh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8291 len. 10]: `` Then why are you in court dress ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8292 len. 22]: `` When should a Celt , who of all the world loves radiance and colour , put on his gay attire ?
Parsing [sent. 8293 len. 10]: For the multitude , or for the one ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8294 len. 4]: `` Thank you .
Parsing [sent. 8295 len. 5]: Is it a compliment ?
Parsing [sent. 8296 len. 13]: -- But after your love , everything fine seems only natural ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8297 len. 19]: `` In love there are no compliments ; truth only walks the sacred path between the two doors .
Parsing [sent. 8298 len. 17]: I will love you as my father loved my mother , and loves her still . ''
Parsing [sent. 8299 len. 9]: `` I do like to see you shining !
Parsing [sent. 8300 len. 14]: It was kind of you to dress for the moon and me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8301 len. 10]: `` Whoever loves the truth must love shining things !
Parsing [sent. 8302 len. 29]: God is the father of lights , even of the lights hid in the dark earth -- sapphires and rubies , and all the families of splendour . ''
Parsing [sent. 8303 len. 10]: `` I shall always see you like that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8304 len. 35]: `` There is one thing I want to say to you , Mercy : -- you will not think me indifferent however long I may be in proposing a definite plan for our future !
Parsing [sent. 8305 len. 7]: We must wait upon God ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8306 len. 12]: `` I shall think nothing you would not have me think .
Parsing [sent. 8307 len. 16]: A little while ago I might have dreamed anything , for I was fast asleep .
Parsing [sent. 8308 len. 8]: I was dead till you waked me .
Parsing [sent. 8309 len. 37]: If I were what girls call IN LOVE , I should be impatient to be with you ; but I love you much more than that , and do not need to be always with you .
Parsing [sent. 8310 len. 15]: You have made me able to think , and I can think about you !
Parsing [sent. 8311 len. 15]: I was but a child , and you made a woman of me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8312 len. 10]: `` God and Ian did , '' said Alister .
Parsing [sent. 8313 len. 16]: `` Yes , but through you , and I want to be worthy of you .
Parsing [sent. 8314 len. 38]: A woman to whom a man 's love was so little comfort that she pined away and died because she could not be married to him , would not be a wife worthy of my chief ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8315 len. 9]: `` Then you will always trust me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8316 len. 4]: `` I will .
Parsing [sent. 8317 len. 12]: When one really knows another , then all is safe ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8318 len. 9]: `` How many people do you know ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8319 len. 4]: asked the chief .
Parsing [sent. 8320 len. 17]: She thought a moment , and with a little laugh , replied , `` You . ''
Parsing [sent. 8321 len. 19]: `` Pardon me , Mercy , but I do want to know how your father treats you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8322 len. 10]: `` We will not talk about him , please .
Parsing [sent. 8323 len. 5]: He is my father !
Parsing [sent. 8324 len. 19]: -- and so far yours that you are bound to make what excuse you can for him . ''
Parsing [sent. 8325 len. 18]: `` That I am bound to do , if he were no father to either of us .
Parsing [sent. 8326 len. 10]: It is what God is always doing for us !
Parsing [sent. 8327 len. 10]: -- only he will never let us off . ''
Parsing [sent. 8328 len. 12]: `` He has had no one to teach him , Alister !
Parsing [sent. 8329 len. 14]: and has always been rich , and accustomed to have his own way !
Parsing [sent. 8330 len. 21]: I begin to think one punishment of making money in a wrong manner is to be prosperous in it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8331 len. 8]: `` I am sure you are right !
Parsing [sent. 8332 len. 12]: But will you be able to bear poverty , Mercy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8333 len. 19]: `` Yes , '' she answered , but so carelessly that she seemed to speak without having thought .
Parsing [sent. 8334 len. 10]: `` You do not know what poverty means ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8335 len. 3]: rejoined Alister .
Parsing [sent. 8336 len. 12]: `` We may have to endure much for our people ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8337 len. 11]: `` It means YOU any way , does it not ?
Parsing [sent. 8338 len. 13]: If you and poverty come together , welcome you and your friend !
Parsing [sent. 8339 len. 9]: -- I see I must confess a thing !
Parsing [sent. 8340 len. 11]: Do you remember telling me to read Julius Caesar ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8341 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 8342 len. 27]: `` Do you remember how Portia gave herself a wound , that she might prove to her husband she was able to keep a secret ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8343 len. 6]: `` Yes , surely ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8344 len. 43]: `` I have my meals in my room now , so I can do as I please , and I never eat the nice things dear mother always sends me , but potatoes , and porridge , and bread and milk . ''
Parsing [sent. 8345 len. 9]: `` What IS that for , Mercy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8346 len. 18]: `` To show you I am worthy of being poor -- able at least to be poor .
Parsing [sent. 8347 len. 19]: I have not once tasted anything VERY nice since the letter that made my father so angry . ''
Parsing [sent. 8348 len. 5]: `` You darling ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8349 len. 13]: Of all men a highlander understands independence of the KIND of food .
Parsing [sent. 8350 len. 32]: `` But , '' continued Alister , `` you need not go on with it ; I am quite convinced ; and we must take with thanksgiving what God gives us .
Parsing [sent. 8351 len. 9]: Besides , you have to grow yet ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8352 len. 3]: `` Alister !
Parsing [sent. 8353 len. 7]: and me like a May-pole ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8354 len. 20]: `` You are tall enough , but we are creatures of three dimensions , and need more than height .
Parsing [sent. 8355 len. 12]: You must eat , or you will certainly be ill ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8356 len. 6]: `` Oh , I eat !
Parsing [sent. 8357 len. 6]: But just as you please !
Parsing [sent. 8358 len. 17]: Only it would n't do me the least harm so long as you did n't mind !
Parsing [sent. 8359 len. 15]: It was as much to prove to myself I could , as to you !
Parsing [sent. 8360 len. 20]: But do n't you think it must he nearly time for people to wake from their first sleep ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8361 len. 13]: The same instant there was a little noise -- like a sob .
Parsing [sent. 8362 len. 18]: Mercy started , and when she looked again Alister had vanished -- as noiselessly as he came .
Parsing [sent. 8363 len. 9]: For a moment she sat afraid to move .
Parsing [sent. 8364 len. 17]: A wind came blowing upon her from the window : some one had opened her door !
Parsing [sent. 8365 len. 7]: What if it were her father !
Parsing [sent. 8366 len. 8]: She compelled herself to turn her head .
Parsing [sent. 8367 len. 5]: It was something white !
Parsing [sent. 8368 len. 5]: -- it was Christina !
Parsing [sent. 8369 len. 26]: She came to her through the shadow of the moonlight , put her arms round her , and pressed to her face a wet cheek .
Parsing [sent. 8370 len. 8]: For a moment or two neither spoke .
Parsing [sent. 8371 len. 9]: `` I heard a little , Mercy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8372 len. 3]: sobbed Christina .
Parsing [sent. 8373 len. 27]: `` Forgive me ; I meant no harm ; I only wanted to know if you were awake ; I was coming to see you . ''
Parsing [sent. 8374 len. 6]: `` Thank you , Chrissy !
Parsing [sent. 8375 len. 7]: That was good of you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8376 len. 6]: `` You are a dear !
Parsing [sent. 8377 len. 7]: -- and so is your chief !
Parsing [sent. 8378 len. 7]: I am sorry I scared him !
Parsing [sent. 8379 len. 17]: It made me so miserable to hear you so happy that I could not help it !
Parsing [sent. 8380 len. 9]: Would you mind forgiving me , dear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8381 len. 10]: `` I do n't mind your hearing a bit .
Parsing [sent. 8382 len. 13]: I am glad you should know how the chief loves me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8383 len. 8]: But you must be careful , dear !
Parsing [sent. 8384 len. 15]: Papa might pretend to take him for a robber , and shoot him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8385 len. 7]: `` Oh , no , Chrissy !
Parsing [sent. 8386 len. 7]: He would n't do that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8387 len. 8]: `` I would not be too sure !
Parsing [sent. 8388 len. 11]: I had n't an idea before what papa was like !
Parsing [sent. 8389 len. 11]: Oh what men are , and what they can be !
Parsing [sent. 8390 len. 10]: I shall never hold up my head again ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8391 len. 16]: With this incoherent speech , to Mercy 's astonishment and consternation she burst into tears .
Parsing [sent. 8392 len. 12]: Mercy tried to comfort her , but did not know how .
Parsing [sent. 8393 len. 35]: She had seen for some time that there was a difference in her , that something was the matter , and wondered whether she could be missing Ian , but it was merest surmise .
Parsing [sent. 8394 len. 7]: Perhaps now she would tell her !
Parsing [sent. 8395 len. 10]: She was weeping like a child on her shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 8396 len. 6]: Presently she began to tremble .
Parsing [sent. 8397 len. 27]: Mercy coaxed her into her bed , and undressing quickly , lay down beside her , and took her in her arms to make her warm .
Parsing [sent. 8398 len. 19]: Before the morning , with many breaks of sobbing and weeping , Christina had told Mercy her story .
Parsing [sent. 8399 len. 12]: `` I wish you would let me tell the chief ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8400 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 8401 len. 10]: `` He would know how to comfort you . ''
Parsing [sent. 8402 len. 5]: `` Thank you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8403 len. 9]: said Christina , with not a little indignation .
Parsing [sent. 8404 len. 27]: `` I forgot I was talking to a girl as good as married , who would not keep my secrets any more than her own ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8405 len. 29]: She would have arisen at once to go to her own room , and the night that had brought such joy to Mercy threatened to end very sadly .
Parsing [sent. 8406 len. 19]: She threw her arms round Christina 's waist , locked her hands together , and held her fast .
Parsing [sent. 8407 len. 8]: `` Hear me , Chrissy , darling !
Parsing [sent. 8408 len. 12]: I am a great big huge brute , '' she cried .
Parsing [sent. 8409 len. 7]: `` But I was only stupid .
Parsing [sent. 8410 len. 16]: I would not tell a secret of yours even to Alister -- not for worlds !
Parsing [sent. 8411 len. 18]: If I did , he would be nearer despising me than I should know how to bear .
Parsing [sent. 8412 len. 6]: I will not tell him .
Parsing [sent. 8413 len. 12]: Did I ever break my word to you , Chrissy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8414 len. 8]: `` No , never , Mercy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8415 len. 12]: responded Christina , and turning she put her arms round her .
Parsing [sent. 8416 len. 18]: `` Besides , '' she went on , `` why should I go to anyone for counsel ?
Parsing [sent. 8417 len. 9]: Could I have a better counsellor than Ian ?
Parsing [sent. 8418 len. 6]: Is he not my friend ?
Parsing [sent. 8419 len. 5]: Oh , he is !
Parsing [sent. 8420 len. 3]: he is !
Parsing [sent. 8421 len. 4]: he said so !
Parsing [sent. 8422 len. 5]: he said so ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8423 len. 8]: The words prefaced another storm of tears .
Parsing [sent. 8424 len. 21]: `` He is going to write to me , '' she sobbed , as soon as she could again speak .
Parsing [sent. 8425 len. 11]: `` Perhaps he will love you yet , Chrissy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8426 len. 13]: `` No , no ; he will never love me that way !
Parsing [sent. 8427 len. 12]: For goodness ' sake do n't hint at such a thing !
Parsing [sent. 8428 len. 17]: I should not be able to write a word to him , if I thought that !
Parsing [sent. 8429 len. 10]: I should feel a wolf in sheep 's clothing !
Parsing [sent. 8430 len. 8]: I have done with tricks and pretendings !
Parsing [sent. 8431 len. 17]: Ian shall never say to himself , ' I wish I had not trusted that girl !
Parsing [sent. 8432 len. 9]: I thought she was going to be honest !
Parsing [sent. 8433 len. 10]: But what 's bred in the bone -- ! '
Parsing [sent. 8434 len. 21]: I declare , Mercy , I should blush myself out of being to learn he thought of me like that !
Parsing [sent. 8435 len. 9]: I mean to be worthy of his friendship !
Parsing [sent. 8436 len. 11]: His friendship is better than any other man 's love !
Parsing [sent. 8437 len. 8]: I will be worthy of it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8438 len. 27]: The poor girl burst yet again into tears -- not so bitter as before , and ended them all at once with a kiss to Mercy .
Parsing [sent. 8439 len. 22]: `` For his sake , '' she said , `` I am going to take care of Alister and you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8440 len. 4]: `` Thank you !
Parsing [sent. 8441 len. 5]: thank you , Chrissy !
Parsing [sent. 8442 len. 10]: Only you must not do anything to offend papa !
Parsing [sent. 8443 len. 10]: It is hard enough on him as it is !
Parsing [sent. 8444 len. 36]: I can not give up the chief to please him , for he has been a father to my better self ; but we must do nothing to trouble him that we can help ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8445 len. 5]: CHAPTER XI SOMETHING STRANGE .
Parsing [sent. 8446 len. 9]: Alister did not feel inclined to go home .
Parsing [sent. 8447 len. 31]: The night was more like Mercy , and he lingered with the night , inhabiting the dream that it was Mercy 's house , and she in the next room .
Parsing [sent. 8448 len. 53]: He turned into the castle , climbed the broken steps , and sat on the corner of the wall , the blank hill before him , asleep standing , with the New House on its shoulder , and the moonlight reflected from Mercy 's window under which he had so lately stood .
Parsing [sent. 8449 len. 41]: He sat for an hour , and when he came down , was as much disinclined to go home as before : he could not rest in his chamber , with no Ian on the other side of its wall !
Parsing [sent. 8450 len. 30]: He went straying down the road , into the valley , along the burnside , up the steep beyond it , and away to the hill-farm and the tomb .
Parsing [sent. 8451 len. 21]: The moon was with him all the way , but she seemed thinking to herself rather than talking to him .
Parsing [sent. 8452 len. 17]: Why should the strange , burnt-out old cinder of a satellite be the star of lovers ?
Parsing [sent. 8453 len. 15]: The answer lies hid , I suspect , in the mysteries of light reflected .
Parsing [sent. 8454 len. 46]: He wandered along , careless of time , of moonset , star-shine , or sunrise , brooding on many things in the rayless radiance of his love , and by the time he reached the tomb , was weary with excitement and lack of sleep .
Parsing [sent. 8455 len. 17]: Taking the key from where it was cunningly hidden , he unlocked the door and entered .
Parsing [sent. 8456 len. 33]: He started back at sight of a gray-haired old man , seated on one of the stone chairs , and leaning sadly over the fireless hearth : it must be his uncle !
Parsing [sent. 8457 len. 29]: The same moment he saw it was a ray from the sinking moon , entering by the small , deep window , and shining feebly on the chair .
Parsing [sent. 8458 len. 17]: He struck a light , kindled the peats on the hearth , and went for water .
Parsing [sent. 8459 len. 26]: Returning from the well he found the house dark as before ; and there was the old man again , cowering over the extinguished fire !
Parsing [sent. 8460 len. 24]: The idea lasted but a moment ; once more the level light of the moon lay cold and gray upon the stone chair !
Parsing [sent. 8461 len. 14]: He tried to laugh at his fancifulness , but did not quite succeed .
Parsing [sent. 8462 len. 28]: Several times on the way up , he had thought of his old uncle : this must have given the shape to the moonlight and the stone !
Parsing [sent. 8463 len. 13]: He made many attempts to recall the illusion , but in vain .
Parsing [sent. 8464 len. 11]: He relighted the fire , and put on the kettle .
Parsing [sent. 8465 len. 36]: Going then for a book to read till the water boiled , he remembered a letter which , in the excitement of the afternoon , he had put in his pocket unread , and forgotten .
Parsing [sent. 8466 len. 53]: It was from the family lawyer in Glasgow , informing him that the bank in which his uncle had deposited the proceeds of his sale of the land , was in a state of absolute and irrecoverable collapse ; there was not the slightest hope of retrieving any portion of the wreck .
Parsing [sent. 8467 len. 27]: Alister did not jump up and pace the room in the rage of disappointment ; neither did he sit as one stunned and forlorn of sense .
Parsing [sent. 8468 len. 47]: He felt some bitterness in the loss of the hope of making up to his people for his uncle 's wrong ; but it was clear that if God had cared for his having the money , he would have cared that he should have it .
Parsing [sent. 8469 len. 27]: Here was an opportunity for absolute faith and contentment in the will that looks after all our affairs , the small as well as the great .
Parsing [sent. 8470 len. 23]: Those who think their affairs too insignificant for God 's regard , will justify themselves in lying crushed under their seeming ruin .
Parsing [sent. 8471 len. 26]: Either we live in the heart of an eternal thought , or we are the product and sport of that which is lower than we .
Parsing [sent. 8472 len. 7]: `` It was evil money ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8473 len. 20]: said the chief to himself ; `` it was the sale of a birthright for a mess of pottage !
Parsing [sent. 8474 len. 17]: I would have turned it back into the right channel , the good of my people !
Parsing [sent. 8475 len. 9]: but after all , what can money do ?
Parsing [sent. 8476 len. 13]: It was discontent with poverty that began the ruin of the highlands !
Parsing [sent. 8477 len. 30]: If the heads of the people had but lived pure , active , sober , unostentatious lives , satisfied to be poor , poverty would never have overwhelmed them !
Parsing [sent. 8478 len. 30]: The highlands would have made Scotland great with the greatness of men dignified by high-hearted contentment , and strong with the strength of men who could do without ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8479 len. 36]: Therewith it dawned upon Alister how , when he longed to help his people , his thoughts had always turned , not to God first , but to the money his uncle had left him .
Parsing [sent. 8480 len. 53]: He had trusted in a fancy -- no less a fancy when in his uncle 's possession than when cast into the quicksand of the bank ; for trust in money that is , is no less vain , and is farther from redress , than trust in money that is not .
Parsing [sent. 8481 len. 7]: In God alone can trust repose .
Parsing [sent. 8482 len. 14]: His heart had been so faithless that he did not know it was !
Parsing [sent. 8483 len. 43]: He thought he loved God as the first and last , the beginning , middle , and end of all things , and he had been trusting , not in God , but in uncertain riches , that is in vile Mammon !
Parsing [sent. 8484 len. 8]: It was a painful and humiliating discovery .
Parsing [sent. 8485 len. 20]: `` It was well , '' he said , `` that my false deity should be taken from me !
Parsing [sent. 8486 len. 15]: For my idolatry perhaps , a good gift has failed to reach my people !
Parsing [sent. 8487 len. 23]: I must be more to them than ever , to make up to them for their loss with better than money ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8488 len. 62]: He fell on his knees , and thanked God for the wind that had blown cold through his spirit , and slain at least one evil thing ; and when he rose , all that was left of his trouble was a lump in his throat , which melted away as he walked home through the morning air on the hills .
Parsing [sent. 8489 len. 34]: For he could not delay ; he must let his mother know their trouble , and , as one who had already received help from on high , help her to bear it !
Parsing [sent. 8490 len. 18]: If the messenger of Satan had buffeted him , he had but broken a way for strength !
Parsing [sent. 8491 len. 17]: But at first he could not enjoy as he was wont the glory of the morning .
Parsing [sent. 8492 len. 4]: It troubled him .
Parsing [sent. 8493 len. 24]: Would a single note in the song of the sons of the morning fail because God did or would not do a thing ?
Parsing [sent. 8494 len. 14]: Could God deserve less than thanks perfect from any one of his creatures ?
Parsing [sent. 8495 len. 27]: That man could not know God who thanked him but for what men call good things , nor took the evil as from the same love !
Parsing [sent. 8496 len. 10]: He scorned himself , and lifted up his heart .
Parsing [sent. 8497 len. 40]: As he reached the brow of his last descent , the sun rose , and with it his soul arose and shone , for its light was come , and the glory of the Lord was risen upon it .
Parsing [sent. 8498 len. 23]: `` Let God , '' he said , `` take from us what he will : himself he can only give ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8499 len. 7]: Joyful he went down the hill .
Parsing [sent. 8500 len. 8]: God was , and all was well !
Parsing [sent. 8501 len. 7]: CHAPTER XII THE POWER OF DARKNESS .
Parsing [sent. 8502 len. 14]: He found his mother at breakfast , wondering what had become of him .
Parsing [sent. 8503 len. 14]: `` Are you equal to a bit of bad news , mother ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8504 len. 6]: he asked with a smile .
Parsing [sent. 8505 len. 9]: The mother 's thoughts flew instantly to Ian .
Parsing [sent. 8506 len. 10]: `` Oh , it 's nothing about lan ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8507 len. 8]: said the chief , answering her look .
Parsing [sent. 8508 len. 17]: Its expression changed ; she hoped now it was some fresh obstacle between him and Mercy .
Parsing [sent. 8509 len. 12]: `` No , mother , it is not that either ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8510 len. 31]: said Alister , again answering her look -- with a sad one of his own , for the lack of his mother 's sympathy was the sorest trouble he had .
Parsing [sent. 8511 len. 15]: `` It is only that uncle 's money is gone -- all gone . ''
Parsing [sent. 8512 len. 25]: She sat silent for a moment , gave a little sigh , and said , `` Well , it will all be over soon !
Parsing [sent. 8513 len. 11]: In the meantime things are no worse than they were !
Parsing [sent. 8514 len. 6]: His will be done ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8515 len. 23]: `` I should have liked to make a few friends with the mammon of unrighteousness before we were turned out naked ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8516 len. 21]: `` We shall have plenty , '' answered the mother , '' -- God himself , and a few beside !
Parsing [sent. 8517 len. 17]: If you could make friends with the mammon , you can make friends without it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8518 len. 8]: `` Yes , that is happily true !
Parsing [sent. 8519 len. 27]: lan says it was only a lesson for the wise and prudent with money in their pockets -- a lesson suited to their limited reception ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8520 len. 7]: As they spoke , Nancy entered .
Parsing [sent. 8521 len. 18]: `` Please , laird , she said , `` Donal shoemaker is wanting to see you . ''
Parsing [sent. 8522 len. 12]: `` Tell him to come in , '' answered the chief .
Parsing [sent. 8523 len. 57]: Donal entered and stood up by the door , with his bonnet under his arm -- a little man with puckered face , the puckers radiating from or centering in the mouth , which he seemed to untie like a money-hag , and pull open by means of a smile , before he began to speak .
Parsing [sent. 8524 len. 15]: The chief shook hands with him , and asked how he could serve him .
Parsing [sent. 8525 len. 38]: `` It will not be to your pleasure to know , Macruadh , '' said Donal , humbly declining to sit , `` that I have received this day notice to quit my house and garden ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8526 len. 19]: The house was a turf-cottage , and the garden might grow two bushels and a half of potatoes .
Parsing [sent. 8527 len. 10]: `` Are you far behind with your rent ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8528 len. 8]: `` Not a quarter , Macruadh . ''
Parsing [sent. 8529 len. 8]: `` Then what does it mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8530 len. 29]: `` It means , sir , that Strathruadh is to be given to the red deer , and the son of man have nowhere to lay his head .
Parsing [sent. 8531 len. 36]: I am the first at your door with my sorrow , but before the day is over you will have -- '' Here he named four or five who had received like notice to quit .
Parsing [sent. 8532 len. 8]: `` It is a sad business ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8533 len. 5]: said the chief sorrowfully .
Parsing [sent. 8534 len. 8]: `` Is it law , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8535 len. 19]: `` It is not easy to say what is law , Donal ; certainly it is not gospel !
Parsing [sent. 8536 len. 29]: As a matter of course you will not be without shelter , so long as I may call stone or turf mine , but things are looking bad !
Parsing [sent. 8537 len. 13]: Things as well as souls are in God 's hands however ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8538 len. 26]: `` I learn from the new men on the hills , '' resumed Donal , `` that the new lairds have conspired to exterminate us .
Parsing [sent. 8539 len. 23]: They have discovered , apparently , that the earth was not made for man , but for rich men and beasts ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8540 len. 15]: Here the little man paused , and his insignificant face grew in expression grand .
Parsing [sent. 8541 len. 23]: `` But the day of the Lord will come , '' he went on , `` as a thief in the night .
Parsing [sent. 8542 len. 18]: Vengeance is his , and he will know where to give many stripes , and where few .
Parsing [sent. 8543 len. 11]: -- What would you have us do , laird ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8544 len. 11]: `` I will go with you to the village . ''
Parsing [sent. 8545 len. 9]: `` No , if you please , sir !
Parsing [sent. 8546 len. 23]: Better men will be at your door presently to put the same question , for they will do nothing without the Macruadh .
Parsing [sent. 8547 len. 33]: We are no more on your land , great is our sorrow , chief , but we are of your blood , you are our lord , and your will is ours .
Parsing [sent. 8548 len. 12]: You have been a nursing father to us , Macruadh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8549 len. 7]: `` I would fain be ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8550 len. 4]: answered the chief .
Parsing [sent. 8551 len. 36]: `` They will want to know whether these strangers have the right to turn us out ; and if they have not the right to disseize , whether we have not the right to resist .
Parsing [sent. 8552 len. 35]: If you would have us fight , and will head us , we will fall to a man -- for fall we must ; we can not think to stand before the redcoats . ''
Parsing [sent. 8553 len. 7]: `` No , no , Donal !
Parsing [sent. 8554 len. 21]: It is not a question of the truth ; that we should be bound to die for , of course .
Parsing [sent. 8555 len. 17]: It is only our rights that are concerned , and they are not worth dying for .
Parsing [sent. 8556 len. 16]: That would be mere pride , and denial of God who is fighting for us .
Parsing [sent. 8557 len. 12]: At least so it seems at the moment to me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8558 len. 16]: `` Some of us would fain fight and have done with it , sir ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8559 len. 33]: The chief could not help smiling with pleasure at the little man 's warlike readiness : he knew it was no empty boast ; what there was of him was good stuff .
Parsing [sent. 8560 len. 11]: `` You have a wife and children , Donal ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8561 len. 14]: he said ; `` what would become of them if you fell ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8562 len. 21]: `` My sister was turned out in the cold spring , '' answered Donal , `` and died in Glencalvu !
Parsing [sent. 8563 len. 9]: It would be better to die together ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8564 len. 43]: `` But , Donal , none of yours will die of cold , and I ca n't let you fight , because the wives and children would all come on my hands , and I should have too many for my meal !
Parsing [sent. 8565 len. 7]: No , we must not fight .
Parsing [sent. 8566 len. 28]: We may have a right to fight , I do not know ; but I am sure we have at least the right to abstain from fighting .
Parsing [sent. 8567 len. 19]: Do n't let us confound right and duty , Donal -- neither in thing nor in word ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8568 len. 11]: `` Will the law not help us , Macruadh ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8569 len. 9]: `` The law is such a slow coach !
Parsing [sent. 8570 len. 6]: our enemies are so rich !
Parsing [sent. 8571 len. 9]: and the lawyers have little love of righteousness !
Parsing [sent. 8572 len. 18]: Most of them would see the dust on our heads to have the picking of our bones !
Parsing [sent. 8573 len. 14]: Stick nor stone would be left us before anything came of it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8574 len. 24]: `` But , sir , '' said Donal , `` is it the part of brave men to give up their rights ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8575 len. 31]: `` No man can take from us our rights , '' answered the chief , `` but any man rich enough may keep us from getting the good of them .
Parsing [sent. 8576 len. 13]: I say again we are not bound to insist on our rights .
Parsing [sent. 8577 len. 21]: We may decline to do so , and that way leave them to God to look after for us . ''
Parsing [sent. 8578 len. 12]: `` God does not always give men their rights , sir !
Parsing [sent. 8579 len. 12]: I do n't believe he cares about our small matters ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8580 len. 15]: `` Nothing that God does not care about can be worth our caring about .
Parsing [sent. 8581 len. 12]: But , Donal , how dare you say what you do ?
Parsing [sent. 8582 len. 7]: Have you lived to all eternity ?
Parsing [sent. 8583 len. 8]: How do you know what you say ?
Parsing [sent. 8584 len. 7]: GOD DOES care for our rights .
Parsing [sent. 8585 len. 22]: A day is coming , as you have just said , when he will judge the oppressors of their brethren . ''
Parsing [sent. 8586 len. 13]: `` We shall be all dead and buried long before then ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8587 len. 7]: `` As he pleases , Donal !
Parsing [sent. 8588 len. 5]: He is my chief .
Parsing [sent. 8589 len. 13]: I will have what he wills , not what I should like !
Parsing [sent. 8590 len. 13]: A thousand years I will wait for my rights if he chooses .
Parsing [sent. 8591 len. 10]: I will trust him to do splendidly for me .
Parsing [sent. 8592 len. 13]: No ; I will have no other way than my chief 's !
Parsing [sent. 8593 len. 7]: He will set everything straight ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8594 len. 8]: `` You must be right , sir !
Parsing [sent. 8595 len. 22]: only I ca n't help wishing for the old times , when a man could strike a blow for himself ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8596 len. 49]: With all who came Alister held similar talk ; for though they were not all so warlike as the cobbler , they keenly felt the wrong that was done them , and would mostly , but for a doubt of its rectitude , have opposed force with force .
Parsing [sent. 8597 len. 11]: It would at least bring their case before the country !
Parsing [sent. 8598 len. 25]: `` The case is before a higher tribunal , '' answered the laird ; `` and one 's country is no incarnation of justice !
Parsing [sent. 8599 len. 25]: How could she be , made up mostly of such as do not love fair play except in the abstract , or for themselves !
Parsing [sent. 8600 len. 10]: The wise thing is to submit to wrong . ''
Parsing [sent. 8601 len. 43]: It is in ordering our own thoughts and our own actions , that we have first to stand up for the right ; our business is not to protect ourselves from our neighbour 's wrong , but our neighbour from our wrong .
Parsing [sent. 8602 len. 14]: This is to slay evil ; the other is to make it multiply .
Parsing [sent. 8603 len. 34]: A man who would pull out even a mote from his brother 's eye , must first pull out the beam from his own eye , must be righteous against his own selfishness .
Parsing [sent. 8604 len. 12]: That is the only way to wound the root of evil .
Parsing [sent. 8605 len. 18]: He who teaches his neighbour to insist on his rights , is not a teacher of righteousness .
Parsing [sent. 8606 len. 29]: He who , by fulfilling his own duties , teaches his neighbour to give every man the fair play he owes him , is a fellow-worker with God .
Parsing [sent. 8607 len. 26]: But although not a few of the villagers spoke in wrath and counselled resistance , not one of them rejoiced in the anticipation of disorder .
Parsing [sent. 8608 len. 38]: Heartily did Rob of the Angels insist on peace , but his words had the less force that he was puny in person , and , although capable of great endurance , unnoted for deeds of strength .
Parsing [sent. 8609 len. 40]: Evil birds carried the words of natural and righteous anger to the ears of the new laird ; no good birds bore the words of appeasement : he concluded after his kind that their chief countenanced a determined resistance .
Parsing [sent. 8610 len. 13]: On all sides the horizon was dark about the remnant of Clanruadh .
Parsing [sent. 8611 len. 19]: Poorly as they lived in Strathruadh , they knew no place else where they could live at all .
Parsing [sent. 8612 len. 16]: Separated , and so disabled from making common cause against want , they must perish !
Parsing [sent. 8613 len. 13]: But their horizon was not heaven , and God was beyond it .
Parsing [sent. 8614 len. 35]: It was a great comfort to the chief that in the matter of his clan his mother agreed with him altogether : to the last penny of their having they must help their people !
Parsing [sent. 8615 len. 19]: Those who feel as if the land were their own , do fearful wrong to their own souls !
Parsing [sent. 8616 len. 9]: What grandest opportunities of growing divine they lose !
Parsing [sent. 8617 len. 33]: Instead of being man-nobles , leading a sumptuous life until it no longer looks sumptuous , they might be God-nobles -- saviours of men , yielding themselves to and for their brethren !
Parsing [sent. 8618 len. 31]: What friends might they not make with the mammon of unrighteousness , instead of passing hence into a region where no doors , no arms will be open to them !
Parsing [sent. 8619 len. 18]: Things are ours that we may use them for all -- sometimes that we may sacrifice them .
Parsing [sent. 8620 len. 12]: God had but one precious thing , and he gave that !
Parsing [sent. 8621 len. 59]: The chief , although he saw that the proceedings of Mr. Palmer and Mr. Brander must have been determined upon while his relation to Mercy was yet undeclared , could not help imagining how differently it might have gone with his people , had he been married to Mercy , and in a good understanding with her father .
Parsing [sent. 8622 len. 16]: Had he crippled his reach toward men by the narrowness of his conscience toward God ?
Parsing [sent. 8623 len. 22]: So long as he did what seemed right , he must regret no consequences , even for the sake of others !
Parsing [sent. 8624 len. 9]: God would mind others as well as him !
Parsing [sent. 8625 len. 36]: Every sequence of right , even to the sword and fire , are God 's care ; he will justify himself in the eyes of the true , nor heed the judgment of the false .
Parsing [sent. 8626 len. 33]: One thing was clear -- that it would do but harm to beg of Mr. Palmer any pity for his people : it would but give zest to his rejoicing in iniquity !
Parsing [sent. 8627 len. 15]: Something nevertheless must be determined , and speedily , for winter was at hand .
Parsing [sent. 8628 len. 21]: The Macruadh had to consider not only the immediate accommodation of the ejected but how they were to be maintained .
Parsing [sent. 8629 len. 39]: Such was his difficulty that he began to long for such news from Ian as would justify an exodus from their own country , not the less a land of bondage , to a home in the wilderness .
Parsing [sent. 8630 len. 18]: But ah , what would then the land of his fathers without its people be to him !
Parsing [sent. 8631 len. 20]: It would be no more worthy the name of land , no longer fit to be called a possession !
Parsing [sent. 8632 len. 19]: He knew then that the true love of the land is one with the love of its people .
Parsing [sent. 8633 len. 20]: To live on it after they were gone , would be like making a home of the family mausoleum .
Parsing [sent. 8634 len. 30]: The rich `` pant after the dust of the earth on the head of the poor , '' but what would any land become without the poor in it ?
Parsing [sent. 8635 len. 36]: The poor are blessed because by their poverty they are open to divine influences ; they are the buckets set out to catch the rain of heaven ; they are the salt of the earth !
Parsing [sent. 8636 len. 21]: The poor are to be always with a nation for its best blessing , or for its condemnation and ruin .
Parsing [sent. 8637 len. 20]: The chief saw the valleys desolate of the men readiest and ablest to fight the battles of his country .
Parsing [sent. 8638 len. 49]: For the sake of greedy , low-minded fellows , the summons of her war-pipes would be heard in them no more , or would sound in vain among the manless rocks ; from sheilin , cottage , or clachan , would spring no kilted warriors with battle response !
Parsing [sent. 8639 len. 23]: The red deer and the big sheep had taken the place of men over countless miles of mountain and moor and strath !
Parsing [sent. 8640 len. 25]: His heart bled for the sufferings and wrongs of those whose ancestors died to keep the country free that was now expelling their progeny .
Parsing [sent. 8641 len. 19]: But the vengeance had begun to gather , though neither his generation nor ours has seen it break .
Parsing [sent. 8642 len. 16]: It must be that offences come , but woe unto them by whom they come !
Parsing [sent. 8643 len. 3]: CHAPTER XIII .
Parsing [sent. 8644 len. 4]: THE NEW STANCE .
Parsing [sent. 8645 len. 49]: The Macruadh cast his mind 's and his body 's eye too upon the small strip of ground on the west side of the castle-ridge , between it and the tiny tributary of the strath burn which was here the boundary between the lands of the two lairds .
Parsing [sent. 8646 len. 70]: The slope of the ridge on this side was not so steep , and before the rock sank into the alluvial soil of the valley , it became for a few yards nearly level -- sufficiently so , with a little smoothing and raising , to serve for a foundation ; while in front was a narrow but rich piece of ground , the bank of the little brook .
Parsing [sent. 8647 len. 24]: Before many days were over , men were at work there , in full sight of the upper windows of the New House .
Parsing [sent. 8648 len. 57]: It was not at first clear what they were about ; but soon began to rise , plain enough , the walls of cottages , some of stone , and some of turf ; Mr. Palmer saw a new village already in process of construction , to take the place of that about to be destroyed !
Parsing [sent. 8649 len. 16]: The despicable enemy had moved his camp , to pitch it under his very walls !
Parsing [sent. 8650 len. 9]: It filled him with the rage of defeat .
Parsing [sent. 8651 len. 15]: The poor man who scorned him was going to be too much for him !
Parsing [sent. 8652 len. 17]: Not yet was he any nearer to being placed alone in the midst of the earth .
Parsing [sent. 8653 len. 56]: He thought to have rid himself of all those hateful faces , full of their chiefs contempt , he imagined , ever eyeing him as an intruder on his own land ; but here instead was their filthy little hamlet of hovels growing like a fungus just under his nose , expressly to spite him !
Parsing [sent. 8654 len. 12]: Thinking to destroy it , he had merely sent for it !
Parsing [sent. 8655 len. 24]: When the wind was in the east , the smoke of their miserable cabins would be blown right in at his dining-room windows !
Parsing [sent. 8656 len. 6]: It was useless to expostulate !
Parsing [sent. 8657 len. 27]: That he would not like it was of course the chief 's first reason for choosing that one spot as the site of his new rookery !
Parsing [sent. 8658 len. 9]: The fellow had stolen a march upon him !
Parsing [sent. 8659 len. 17]: And what had he done beyond what was absolutely necessary for the improvement of his property !
Parsing [sent. 8660 len. 17]: The people were in his way , and he only wanted to get rid of them !
Parsing [sent. 8661 len. 12]: And here their chief had brought them almost into his garden !
Parsing [sent. 8662 len. 23]: Doubtless if his land had come near enough , he would have built his sty at the very gate of his shrubbery !
Parsing [sent. 8663 len. 12]: -- the fellow could not like having them so near himself !
Parsing [sent. 8664 len. 14]: He let his whole household see how annoying the thing was to him .
Parsing [sent. 8665 len. 11]: He never doubted it was done purely to irritate him .
Parsing [sent. 8666 len. 18]: Christina ventured the suggestion that Mr. Brander and not the chief was the author of the inconvenience .
Parsing [sent. 8667 len. 5]: What did that matter !
Parsing [sent. 8668 len. 3]: he returned .
Parsing [sent. 8669 len. 20]: What right had the chief , as she called him , to interfere between a landlord and his tenants ?
Parsing [sent. 8670 len. 38]: Christina hinted that , evicted by their landlord , they ceased to be his tenants , and even were he not their chief , he could not be said to interfere in giving help to the destitute .
Parsing [sent. 8671 len. 32]: Thereupon he burst at her in a way that terrified her , and she had never even been checked by him before , had often been impertinent to him without rebuke .
Parsing [sent. 8672 len. 29]: The man seemed entirely changed , but in truth he was no whit changed : things had but occurred capable of bringing out the facts of his nature .
Parsing [sent. 8673 len. 18]: Her mother , who had not dared to speak at the time , expostulated with her afterward .
Parsing [sent. 8674 len. 11]: `` Why should papa never be told the truth ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8675 len. 3]: objected Christina .
Parsing [sent. 8676 len. 34]: Her mother was on the point of replying , `` Because he will not hear it , '' but saw she owed it to her husband not to say so to his child .
Parsing [sent. 8677 len. 27]: Mercy said to herself , `` It is not to annoy my father he does it , but to do what he can for his people !
Parsing [sent. 8678 len. 18]: He does not even know how unpleasant it is to my father to have them so near !
Parsing [sent. 8679 len. 19]: It must be one of the punishments of riches that they make the sight of poverty so disagreeable !
Parsing [sent. 8680 len. 10]: To luxury , poverty is a living reproach . ''
Parsing [sent. 8681 len. 16]: She longed to see Alister : something might perhaps be done to mitigate the offence .
Parsing [sent. 8682 len. 11]: But her father would never consent to use her influence !
Parsing [sent. 8683 len. 5]: Perhaps her mother might !
Parsing [sent. 8684 len. 45]: She suggested therefore that Alister would do nothing for the sake of annoying her father , and could have no idea how annoying this thing was to him : if her mother would contrive her seeing him , she would represent it to him !
Parsing [sent. 8685 len. 23]: Mrs. Palmer was of Mercy 's opinion regarding the purity of Alister 's intent , and promised to think the matter over .
Parsing [sent. 8686 len. 23]: The next night her husband was going to spend at Mr. Brander 's : the project might be carried out in safety !
Parsing [sent. 8687 len. 6]: The thing should be done !
Parsing [sent. 8688 len. 21]: They would go together , in the hope of persuading the chief to change the site of his new village !
Parsing [sent. 8689 len. 25]: When it was dark they walked to the cottage , and knocking at the door , asked Nancy if the chief were at home .
Parsing [sent. 8690 len. 37]: The girl invited them to enter , though not with her usual cordiality ; but Mrs. Palmer declined , requesting her to let the chief know they were there , desirous of a word with him .
Parsing [sent. 8691 len. 32]: Alister was at the door in a moment , and wanted them to go in and see his mother , but an instant 's reflection made him glad of their refusal .
Parsing [sent. 8692 len. 12]: `` I am so sorry for all that has happened ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8693 len. 4]: said Mrs. Palmer .
Parsing [sent. 8694 len. 13]: `` You know I can have had nothing to do with it !
Parsing [sent. 8695 len. 23]: There is not a man I should like for a son-in-law better than yourself , Macruadh ; but I am helpless . ''
Parsing [sent. 8696 len. 19]: `` I quite understand , '' replied the chief , `` and thank you heartily for your kindness .
Parsing [sent. 8697 len. 10]: Is there anything I can do for you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8698 len. 13]: `` Mercy has something she wants to speak to you about . ''
Parsing [sent. 8699 len. 11]: `` It was so good of you to bring her !
Parsing [sent. 8700 len. 8]: -- What is it , Mercy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8701 len. 55]: Without the least hesitation , Mercy told him her father 's fancy that he was building the new village to spite him , seeing it could not be a pleasure to himself to have the smoke from its chimneys blowing in at door and windows as often as the wind was from the sea .
Parsing [sent. 8702 len. 15]: `` I am sorry but not surprised your father should think so , Mercy .
Parsing [sent. 8703 len. 13]: To trouble him is as much against my feelings as my interests .
Parsing [sent. 8704 len. 28]: And certainly it is for no convenience or comfort to ourselves , that my mother and I have determined on having the village immediately below us . ''
Parsing [sent. 8705 len. 38]: `` I thought , '' said Mercy , `` that if you knew how it vexed papa , you would -- But I am afraid it may be for some reason that can not be helped ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8706 len. 15]: `` Indeed it is ; I too am afraid it can not be helped !
Parsing [sent. 8707 len. 7]: I must think of my people !
Parsing [sent. 8708 len. 40]: You see , if I put them on the other side of the ridge , they would be exposed to the east wind -- and the more that every door and window would have to be to the east .
Parsing [sent. 8709 len. 11]: You know yourselves how bitterly it blows down the strath !
Parsing [sent. 8710 len. 29]: Besides , we should there have to build over good land much too damp to be healthy , every foot of which will be wanted to feed them !
Parsing [sent. 8711 len. 7]: There they are on the rock .
Parsing [sent. 8712 len. 29]: I might , of course , put them on the hillside , but I have no place so sheltered as here , and they would have no gardens .
Parsing [sent. 8713 len. 25]: And then it gives me an opportunity , such as chief never had before , of teaching them some things I could not otherwise .
Parsing [sent. 8714 len. 31]: Would it be reasonable , Mercy , to sacrifice the good of so many poor people to spare one rich man one single annoyance , which is yet no hurt ?
Parsing [sent. 8715 len. 5]: Would it be right ?
Parsing [sent. 8716 len. 18]: Ought I not rather to suffer the rise of yet greater obstacles between you and me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8717 len. 8]: `` Yes , Alister , yes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8718 len. 3]: cried Mercy .
Parsing [sent. 8719 len. 7]: `` You must not change anything .
Parsing [sent. 8720 len. 24]: I am only sorry my father can not be taught that you have no ill will to him in what you do . ''
Parsing [sent. 8721 len. 11]: `` I can not think it would make much difference .
Parsing [sent. 8722 len. 10]: He will never give you to me , Mercy .
Parsing [sent. 8723 len. 9]: But be true , and God will . ''
Parsing [sent. 8724 len. 11]: `` Would you mind letting the flag fly , Alister ?
Parsing [sent. 8725 len. 9]: I should have something to look at ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8726 len. 19]: `` I will ; and when I want particularly to see you , I will haul it down .
Parsing [sent. 8727 len. 18]: Then , if you hang a handkerchief from your window , I will come to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 8728 len. 5]: CHAPTER XIV THE PEAT-MOSS .
Parsing [sent. 8729 len. 35]: For the first winter the Clanruadh had not much to fear -- hardly more than usual : they had their small provision of potatoes and meal , and some a poor trifle of money .
Parsing [sent. 8730 len. 59]: But `` Lady Macruadh '' was anxious lest the new cottages should not be quite dry , and gave a general order that fires were to be burned in them for some time before they were occupied : for this they must use their present stock of dry peats , and more must be provided for the winter .
Parsing [sent. 8731 len. 21]: The available strength of the clan would be required to get the fresh stock under cover before the weather broke .
Parsing [sent. 8732 len. 24]: The peat-moss from which they cut their fuel , was at some distance from the castle , on the outskirts of the hill-farm .
Parsing [sent. 8733 len. 45]: It was the nearest moss to the glen , and the old chief , when he parted with so much of the land , took care to except it , knowing well that his remaining people could not without it live through a winter .
Parsing [sent. 8734 len. 57]: But as , of course , his brother , the minister , who succeeded him , and the present chieftain , had freely allowed all the tenants on the land sold to supply themselves from it as before , the notion had been generated that the moss was not part of the chief 's remaining property .
Parsing [sent. 8735 len. 125]: When the report was carried to Mr. Peregrine Palmer , that the tenants Mr. Brander and he were about to eject , and who were in consequence affronting him with a new hamlet on the very verge of his land , were providing themselves with a stock of fuel greatly in excess of what they had usually laid in for the winter -- that in fact they were cutting large quantities of peat , besides the turf for their new cottages ; without making the smallest inquiry , or suspecting for a moment that the proceeding might be justifiable , he determined , after a brief consultation with men who knew nothing but said anything , to put a stop to the supposed presumption .
Parsing [sent. 8736 len. 64]: A few of the peats cut in the summer had not yet been removed , not having dried so well as the rest , and the owners of some of these , two widows , went one day to fetch them home to the new village , when , as it happened , there were none of the clan besides in the moss .
Parsing [sent. 8737 len. 66]: They filled their creels , helped each other to get them on their backs , and were setting out on their weary tramp home , when up rose two of Mr. Palmer 's men , who had been watching them , cut their ropes and took their loads , emptied the peats into a moss-hag full of water , and threw the creels after them .
Parsing [sent. 8738 len. 33]: The poor women poured out their wrath on the men , telling them they would go straight to the chief , but were answered only with mockery of their chief and themselves .
Parsing [sent. 8739 len. 38]: They turned in despair , and with their outcry filled the hollows of the hills as they went , bemoaning the loss of their peats and their creels , and raging at the wrong they had received .
Parsing [sent. 8740 len. 88]: One of them , a characterless creature in the eyes of her neighbours , harmless , and always in want , had faith in her chief , for she had done nothing to make her ashamed , and would go to him at once : he had always a word and a smile and a hand-shake for her , she said ; the other , commonly called Craftie , was unwilling : her character did not stand high , and she feared the face of the Macruadh .
Parsing [sent. 8741 len. 8]: `` He does not like me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8742 len. 3]: said Craftie .
Parsing [sent. 8743 len. 20]: `` When a woman is in trouble , '' said the other , `` the Macruadh makes no questions .
Parsing [sent. 8744 len. 5]: You come with me !
Parsing [sent. 8745 len. 12]: He will be glad of something to do for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 8746 len. 16]: In her confidence she persuaded her companion , and together they went to the chief .
Parsing [sent. 8747 len. 25]: Having gathered courage to appear , Craftie needed none to speak : where that was the call , she was never slow to respond .
Parsing [sent. 8748 len. 18]: `` Craftie , '' said the chief , `` is what you are telling me true ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8749 len. 19]: `` Ask HER , '' answered Craftie , who knew that asseveration on her part was not all-convincing .
Parsing [sent. 8750 len. 13]: `` She speaks the truth , Macruadh , '' said the other .
Parsing [sent. 8751 len. 10]: `` I will take my oath to it . ''
Parsing [sent. 8752 len. 24]: `` Your word is enough , '' replied the chief , '' -- as Craftie knew when she brought you with her . ''
Parsing [sent. 8753 len. 19]: `` Please , laird , it was myself brought Craftie ; she was not willing to come ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8754 len. 19]: `` Craftie , '' said the chief , `` I wish I could make a friend of you !
Parsing [sent. 8755 len. 8]: But you know I ca n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8756 len. 21]: `` I do know it , Macruadh , and I am sorry for it , many is the good time !
Parsing [sent. 8757 len. 23]: But my door never had any latch , and the word is out before I can think to keep it back ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8758 len. 13]: `` And so you send another and another to back the first !
Parsing [sent. 8759 len. 4]: Ah , Craftie !
Parsing [sent. 8760 len. 13]: If purgatory do n't do something for you , then -- ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8761 len. 18]: `` Indeed and I hope I shall fall into it on my way farther , chief ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8762 len. 10]: said Craftie , who happened to be a catholic .
Parsing [sent. 8763 len. 23]: `` But now , '' resumed the chief , `` when will you be going for the rest of your peats ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8764 len. 26]: `` They 're sure to be on the watch for us ; and there 's no saying what they might n't do another time ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8765 len. 7]: was the indirect and hesitating answer .
Parsing [sent. 8766 len. 8]: `` I will go with you . ''
Parsing [sent. 8767 len. 10]: `` When you please , then , chief . ''
Parsing [sent. 8768 len. 22]: So the next day the poor women went again , and the chief went with them , their guard and servant .
Parsing [sent. 8769 len. 13]: If there were any on the watch , they did not appear .
Parsing [sent. 8770 len. 26]: The Macruadh fished out their creels , and put them to dry , then helped them to fill those they had borrowed for the occasion .
Parsing [sent. 8771 len. 23]: Returning , he carried now the one , now the other creel , so that one of the women was always free .
Parsing [sent. 8772 len. 22]: The new laird met them on the road , and recognized with a scornful pleasure the chief bending under his burden .
Parsing [sent. 8773 len. 12]: That was the fellow who would so fain be HIS son-in-law !
Parsing [sent. 8774 len. 13]: About this time Sercombe and Valentine came again to the New House .
Parsing [sent. 8775 len. 31]: Sercombe , although he had of late had no encouragement from Christina , was not therefore prepared to give her up , and came `` to press the siege . ''
Parsing [sent. 8776 len. 26]: He found the lady 's reception of him so far from cordial , however , that he could not but suspect some new adverse influence .
Parsing [sent. 8777 len. 37]: He saw too that Mercy was in disgrace ; and , as Ian was gone , concluded there must have been something between them : had the chief been `` trying it on with '' Christina ?
Parsing [sent. 8778 len. 9]: The brute was always getting in his way !
Parsing [sent. 8779 len. 14]: But some chance of serving him out was certain to turn , up !
Parsing [sent. 8780 len. 40]: For the first suitable day Alister had arranged an expedition from the village , with all the carts that could be got together , to bring home as many peats as horses and men and women could together carry .
Parsing [sent. 8781 len. 30]: The company was seen setting out , and report of it carried at once to Mr. Palmer ; for he had set watch on the doings of the clan .
Parsing [sent. 8782 len. 26]: Within half an hour he too set out with the messenger , accompanied by Sercombe , in grim delight at the prospect of a row .
Parsing [sent. 8783 len. 21]: Valentine went also , willing enough to see what would happen , though with no ill will toward the chief .
Parsing [sent. 8784 len. 25]: They were all furnished as for a day 's shooting , and expected to be joined by some of the keepers on their way .
Parsing [sent. 8785 len. 23]: The chief , in view of possible assault , had taken care that not one of his men should have a gun .
Parsing [sent. 8786 len. 13]: Even Hector of the Stags he requested to leave his at home .
Parsing [sent. 8787 len. 48]: They went in little groups , some about the creeping carts , in which were the older women and younger children , some a good way ahead , some scattered behind , but the main body attending the chief , who talked to them as they went .
Parsing [sent. 8788 len. 14]: They looked a very poor company , but God saw past their poverty .
Parsing [sent. 8789 len. 16]: The chief himself , save in size and strength , had not a flourishing appearance .
Parsing [sent. 8790 len. 19]: He was very thoughtful : much lay on his shoulders , and Ian was not there to help !
Parsing [sent. 8791 len. 29]: His clothes , all their clothes were shabby , with a crumpled , blown-about look -- like drifts , in their many faded colours , of autumnal leaves .
Parsing [sent. 8792 len. 44]: They had about them all a forgotten air -- looked thin and wan like a ghostly funeral to the second sight -- as if they had walked so long they had forgotten how to sleep , and the grave would not have them .
Parsing [sent. 8793 len. 49]: Except in their chief , there was nothing left of the martial glance and gait and show , once so notable in every gathering of the Clanruadh , when the men were all soldiers born , and the women were mothers , daughters , and wives of soldiers .
Parsing [sent. 8794 len. 89]: Their former stately grace had vanished from the women ; they were weather-worn and bowed with labour too heavy for their strength , too long for their endurance ; they were weak from lack of fit human food , from lack of hope , and the dreariness of the outlook , the ever gray spiritual horizon ; they were numbed with the cold that has ceased to be felt , the deadening sense of life as a weight to be borne , not a strength to rejoice in .
Parsing [sent. 8795 len. 20]: But they were not abject yet ; there was one that loved them -- their chief and their friend !
Parsing [sent. 8796 len. 34]: Below their level was a deeper depth , in which , alas , lie many of like heart and , passions with them , trodden into the mire by Dives and his stewards !
Parsing [sent. 8797 len. 21]: The carts were small , with puny horses , long-tailed and droop-necked , in harness of more rope than leather .
Parsing [sent. 8798 len. 40]: They had a look of old men , an aspect weirdly venerable , as of life and labour prolonged after due time , as of creatures kept from the grave and their last sleep to work a little longer .
Parsing [sent. 8799 len. 49]: Scrambling up the steep places they were like that rare sea-bird which , unable to fly for shortness of wing , makes of its beak a third leg , to help it up the cliff : these horses seemed to make fifth legs of their necks and noses .
Parsing [sent. 8800 len. 32]: The chief 's horses alone , always at the service of the clan , looked well fed , well kept , and strong , and the clan was proud of them .
Parsing [sent. 8801 len. 10]: `` And what news is there from Ian ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8802 len. 8]: asked an old man of his chief .
Parsing [sent. 8803 len. 13]: `` Not much news yet , but I hope for more soon .
Parsing [sent. 8804 len. 24]: It will be so easy to let you hear all his letters , when we can meet any moment in the barn ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8805 len. 16]: `` I fear he will be wanting us all to go after the rest ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8806 len. 6]: said one of the women .
Parsing [sent. 8807 len. 9]: `` There might be a worse thing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8808 len. 4]: answered her neighbour .
Parsing [sent. 8809 len. 13]: `` A worse thing than leave the hills where we were born ?
Parsing [sent. 8810 len. 3]: -- No !
Parsing [sent. 8811 len. 7]: There is no worse for me !
Parsing [sent. 8812 len. 14]: I trust in God I shall be buried where I grew up ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8813 len. 11]: `` Then you will leave the hills sure enough ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8814 len. 4]: said the chief .
Parsing [sent. 8815 len. 7]: `` Not so sure , Macruadh !
Parsing [sent. 8816 len. 11]: We shall rest in our graves till the resurrection ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8817 len. 5]: said an old man .
Parsing [sent. 8818 len. 9]: `` Only our bodies , '' returned Alister .
Parsing [sent. 8819 len. 12]: `` Well , and what will my body be but myself !
Parsing [sent. 8820 len. 10]: Much I would make of myself without my body !
Parsing [sent. 8821 len. 30]: I will stay with my body , and let my soul step about , waiting for me , and craving a shot at the stags with the big branches !
Parsing [sent. 8822 len. 13]: No , I wo n't be going from my own strath ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8823 len. 32]: `` You would not like to be left in it alone , with none but unfriendly Sasunnachs about you -- not one of your own people to close your eyes ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8824 len. 8]: `` Indeed it would not be pleasant .
Parsing [sent. 8825 len. 43]: But the winds would be the same ; and the hills would be the same ; and the smell of the earth would be the same ; and they would be our own worms that came crawling over me to eat me !
Parsing [sent. 8826 len. 21]: No ; I wo n't leave the strath till I die -- and I wo n't leave it then ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8827 len. 9]: `` That is very well , John ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8828 len. 48]: said the woman ; `` but if you were all day with your little ones -- all of them all day looking hunger in your face , you would think it a blessed country wherever it was that gave you bread to put in their mouths ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8829 len. 10]: `` And how to keep calling this home ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8830 len. 3]: said another .
Parsing [sent. 8831 len. 23]: `` Why , it will soon be everywhere a crime to set foot on a hill , for frightening of the deer !
Parsing [sent. 8832 len. 38]: I was walking last month in a part of the county I did not know , when I came to a wall that went out of my sight , seeming to go all round a big hill .
Parsing [sent. 8833 len. 18]: I said to myself , ` Is no poor man to climb to heaven any more ? '
Parsing [sent. 8834 len. 91]: And with that I came to a bill stuck on a post , which answered me ; for it said thus : ` Any well-dressed person , who will give his word not to leave the path , may have permission to go to the top of the hill , by applying to -- ' -- I forget the name of the doorkeeper , but sure he was not of God , seeing his door was not to let a poor man in , but to keep him out ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8835 len. 26]: `` They do well to starve us before they choke us : we might else fight when it comes to the air to breathe ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8836 len. 12]: `` Have patience , my sons , '' said the chief .
Parsing [sent. 8837 len. 8]: `` God will not forget us . ''
Parsing [sent. 8838 len. 8]: `` What better are we for that ?
Parsing [sent. 8839 len. 13]: It would be all the same if he did forget us ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8840 len. 9]: growled a young fellow shambling along without shoes .
Parsing [sent. 8841 len. 3]: `` Shame !
Parsing [sent. 8842 len. 3]: Shame ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8843 len. 4]: cried several voices .
Parsing [sent. 8844 len. 9]: `` Has not God left us the Macruadh ?
Parsing [sent. 8845 len. 9]: Does he not share everything with us ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8846 len. 14]: `` The best coat in the clan is on his own back ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8847 len. 12]: muttered the lad , careless whether he were heard or not .
Parsing [sent. 8848 len. 5]: `` You scoundrel ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8849 len. 11]: cried another ; `` yours is a warmer one ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8850 len. 10]: The chief heard all , and held his peace .
Parsing [sent. 8851 len. 9]: It was true he had the best coat !
Parsing [sent. 8852 len. 33]: `` I tell you what , '' said Donal shoemaker , `` if the chief give you the stick , not one of us will say it was more than you deserved !
Parsing [sent. 8853 len. 26]: If he will put it into my hands , not to defile his own , I will take and give it with all my heart .
Parsing [sent. 8854 len. 11]: Everybody knows you for the idlest vagabond in the village !
Parsing [sent. 8855 len. 15]: Why , the chief with his own hands works ten times as much ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8856 len. 19]: `` That 's how he takes the bread out of my mouth -- doing his work himself ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8857 len. 20]: rejoined the youth , who had been to Glasgow , and thought he had learned a thing or two .
Parsing [sent. 8858 len. 16]: The chief recovered from his impulse to pull off his coat and give it him .
Parsing [sent. 8859 len. 26]: `` I will make you an offer , my lad , '' he said instead : `` come to the farm and take my place .
Parsing [sent. 8860 len. 27]: For every fair day 's work you shall have a fair day 's wages , and , for every bit of idleness , a fair thrashing .
Parsing [sent. 8861 len. 5]: Do you agree ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8862 len. 34]: The youth pretended to laugh the thing off , but slunk away , and was seen no more till eating time arrived , and `` Lady Macruadh 's '' well-filled baskets were opened .
Parsing [sent. 8863 len. 14]: `` And who would n't see a better coat on his chief ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8864 len. 5]: cried the little tailor .
Parsing [sent. 8865 len. 13]: `` I would clip my own to make lappets for his ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8866 len. 5]: They reached the moss .
Parsing [sent. 8867 len. 52]: It lay in a fold of the hills , desert and dreary , full of great hollows and holes whence the peat had been taken , now filled with water , black and terrible , -- a land hideous by day , and at night full of danger and lonely horror .
Parsing [sent. 8868 len. 26]: Everywhere stood piles of peats set up to dry , with many openings through and through , windy drains to gather and remove their moisture .
Parsing [sent. 8869 len. 55]: Here and there was a tuft of dry grass , a bush of heather , or a few slender-stalked , hoary heads of CANNACH or cotton-grass ; it was a land of devoted desolation , doing nothing for itself , this bountiful store of life and warmth for the winter-sieged houses of the strath .
Parsing [sent. 8870 len. 6]: They went heartily to work .
Parsing [sent. 8871 len. 33]: They cut turf for their walls and peats for their fires ; they loaded the carts from the driest piles , and made new piles of the fresh wet peats they dug .
Parsing [sent. 8872 len. 41]: It was approaching noon , and some of the old women were getting the food out of `` my lady 's '' baskets , when over the nearest ridge beyond rose men to the number of seven , carrying guns .
Parsing [sent. 8873 len. 11]: Rob of the Angels was the first to spy them .
Parsing [sent. 8874 len. 15]: He pointed them out to his father , and presently they two disappeared together .
Parsing [sent. 8875 len. 35]: The rest went on with their work , but the chief could see that , stooping to their labour , they cast upward and sidelong glances at them , reading hostility in their approach .
Parsing [sent. 8876 len. 24]: Suddenly , as by common consent , they all ceased working , stood erect , and looked out like men on their guard .
Parsing [sent. 8877 len. 18]: But the chief making them a sign , they resumed their labour as if they saw nothing .
Parsing [sent. 8878 len. 16]: Mr. Peregrine Palmer had laid it upon himself to act with becoming calmness and dignity .
Parsing [sent. 8879 len. 71]: But it would amaze most people to be told how little their order is self-restraint , their regular conduct their own -- how much of the savage and how little of the civilized man goes to form their being -- how much their decent behaviour is owing to the moral pressure , like that of the atmosphere , of the laws and persons and habits and opinions that surround them .
Parsing [sent. 8880 len. 31]: Witness how many , who seemed respectable people at home , become vulgar , self - indulgent , ruffianly , cruel even , in the wilder parts of the colonies !
Parsing [sent. 8881 len. 33]: No man who has not , through restraint , learned not to need restraint , but be as well behaved among savages as in society , has yet become a true man .
Parsing [sent. 8882 len. 29]: No perfection of mere civilization kills the savage in a man : the savage is there all the time till the man pass through the birth from above .
Parsing [sent. 8883 len. 19]: Till then , he is no certain hiding-place from the wind , no sure covert from the tempest .
Parsing [sent. 8884 len. 14]: Mr. Palmer was in the worst of positions as to protection against himself .
Parsing [sent. 8885 len. 16]: Possessed of large property , he owed his position to evil and not to good .
Parsing [sent. 8886 len. 44]: Not only had he done nothing to raise those through whom he made his money , but the very making of their money his , was plunging them deeper and deeper in poverty and vice : his success was the ruin of many .
Parsing [sent. 8887 len. 39]: Yet was he full of his own imagined importance -- or had been full until now that he felt a worm at the root of his gourd -- the contempt of one man for his wealth and position .
Parsing [sent. 8888 len. 18]: Well might such a man hate such another -- and the more that his daughter loved him !
Parsing [sent. 8889 len. 44]: All the chief 's schemes and ways were founded on such opposite principles to his own that of necessity they annoyed him at every point , and , incapable of perceiving their true nature , he imagined his annoyance their object and end .
Parsing [sent. 8890 len. 23]: And now here was his enemy insolently daring , as Mr. Palmer fully believed , to trespass in person on his land !
Parsing [sent. 8891 len. 54]: Add to all this , that here Mr. Peregrine Palmer was in a place whose remoteness lightened the pressure of conventional restraints , while its wildness tended to rouse all the old savage in him -- its very look suggesting to the city-man its fitness for an unlawful deed for a lawful end .
Parsing [sent. 8892 len. 27]: Persons more RESPECTABLE than Mr. Palmer are capable of doing the most wicked and lawless things when their selfish sense of their own right is uppermost .
Parsing [sent. 8893 len. 21]: Witness the occasionally iniquitous judgments of country magistrates in their own interest -- how they drive law even to cruelty !
Parsing [sent. 8894 len. 15]: `` Are you not aware you are trespassing on my land , Macruadh ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8895 len. 18]: cried the new laird , across several holes full of black water which obstructed his nearer approach .
Parsing [sent. 8896 len. 24]: `` On the contrary , Mr. Palmer , '' replied the chief , `` I am perfectly aware that I am not ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8897 len. 14]: `` You have no right to cut peats there without my permission ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8898 len. 21]: `` I beg your pardon : you have no right to stand where you speak the words without my permission .
Parsing [sent. 8899 len. 7]: But you are quite welcome . ''
Parsing [sent. 8900 len. 21]: `` I am satisfied there is not a word of truth in what you say , '' rejoined Mr. Palmer .
Parsing [sent. 8901 len. 13]: `` I desire you to order your people away at once . ''
Parsing [sent. 8902 len. 7]: `` That I can not do .
Parsing [sent. 8903 len. 13]: It would be to require their consent to die of cold . ''
Parsing [sent. 8904 len. 5]: `` Let them die !
Parsing [sent. 8905 len. 10]: What are they to me -- or to anybody !
Parsing [sent. 8906 len. 19]: Order them off , or it will be the worse for them -- and for you too ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8907 len. 9]: `` Excuse me ; I can not . ''
Parsing [sent. 8908 len. 8]: `` I give you one more warning .
Parsing [sent. 8909 len. 9]: Go yourself , and they will follow . ''
Parsing [sent. 8910 len. 6]: `` I will not . ''
Parsing [sent. 8911 len. 10]: `` Go , or I will compel you . ''
Parsing [sent. 8912 len. 10]: As he spoke , he half raised his gun .
Parsing [sent. 8913 len. 6]: `` You dare not ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8914 len. 9]: said the chief , drawing himself up indignantly .
Parsing [sent. 8915 len. 19]: Together Mr. Palmer and Mr. Sercombe raised their guns to their shoulders , and one of them fired .
Parsing [sent. 8916 len. 26]: To give Mr. Palmer the benefit of a doubt , he was not quite at home with his gun , and would use a hair-trigger .
Parsing [sent. 8917 len. 31]: The same instant each found himself , breath and consciousness equally scant , floundering , gun and all , in the black bog water on whose edge he had stood .
Parsing [sent. 8918 len. 34]: There now stood Rob of the Angels , gazing after them into the depth , with the look of an avenging seraph , his father beside him , grim as a gratified Fate .
Parsing [sent. 8919 len. 57]: Such a roar of rage rose from the clansmen with the shot , and so many came bounding with sticks and spades over the rough ground , that the keepers , knowing , if each killed his two men , they would not after escape with their lives , judged it more prudent to wait orders .
Parsing [sent. 8920 len. 13]: Only Valentine came running in terror to the help of his father .
Parsing [sent. 8921 len. 20]: `` Do n't be frightened , '' said Rob ; `` we only wanted to wet their powder ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8922 len. 8]: `` But they 'll be drowned ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8923 len. 7]: cried the lad , almost weeping .
Parsing [sent. 8924 len. 8]: `` Not a hair of them ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8925 len. 3]: answered Bob .
Parsing [sent. 8926 len. 10]: `` We 'll have them out in a moment !
Parsing [sent. 8927 len. 21]: But please tell your men , if they dare to lift a gun , we 'll serve them the same .
Parsing [sent. 8928 len. 12]: It wets the horn , and it cools the man ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8929 len. 38]: A minute more , and the two men lay coughing and gasping on the crumbly bank , for in their utter surprizal they had let more of the nasty soft water inside than was good for them .
Parsing [sent. 8930 len. 9]: With his first breath Sercombe began to swear .
Parsing [sent. 8931 len. 22]: `` Drop that , sir , if you please , '' said Rob , `` or in you go again ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8932 len. 26]: He began to reply with a volley of oaths , but began only , for the same instant the black water was again choking him .
Parsing [sent. 8933 len. 29]: Might Hector of the Stags have had his way , he would have kept there the murderer of AN CABRACH MOR till he had to be dived for .
Parsing [sent. 8934 len. 22]: Rob on his part was determined he should not come out until he gave his word that he would not swear .
Parsing [sent. 8935 len. 3]: `` Come !
Parsing [sent. 8936 len. 3]: Come ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8937 len. 31]: gasped Sercombe at length , after many attempts to get out which , the bystanders easily foiled -- '' you do n't mean to drown me , do you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8938 len. 9]: `` We mean to drown your bad language .
Parsing [sent. 8939 len. 13]: Promise to use no more on this peat-moss , '' returned Rob .
Parsing [sent. 8940 len. 10]: `` Damn the promise you get from me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8941 len. 3]: he gasped .
Parsing [sent. 8942 len. 11]: `` Men must have patience with a suffering brother ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8943 len. 46]: remarked Bob , and seated himself , with a few words in Gaelic which drew a hearty laugh from the men about him , on a heap of turf to watch the unyielding flounder in the peat-hole , where there was no room to swim .
Parsing [sent. 8944 len. 33]: He had begun to think the man would drown in his contumacy , when his ears welcomed the despairing words -- `` Take me out , and I will promise anything . ''
Parsing [sent. 8945 len. 66]: He was scarcely able to move till one of the keepers gave him whisky , but in a few minutes he was crawling homeward after his host , who , parent of little streams , was doing his best to walk over rocks and through bogs with the help of Valentine 's arm , chattering rather than muttering something about `` proper legal fashion . ''
Parsing [sent. 8946 len. 24]: In the mean time the chief lay shot in the right arm and chest , but not dangerously wounded by the scattering lead .
Parsing [sent. 8947 len. 19]: He had lost a good deal of blood , and was faint -- a sensation new to him .
Parsing [sent. 8948 len. 28]: The women had done what they could , but that was only binding his arm , laying him in a dry place , and giving him water .
Parsing [sent. 8949 len. 14]: He would not let them recall the men till the enemy was gone .
Parsing [sent. 8950 len. 32]: When they knew what had happened they were in sad trouble -- Rob of the Angels especially that he had not been quick enough to prevent the firing of the gun .
Parsing [sent. 8951 len. 46]: The chief would have him get the shot out of his arm with his knife ; but Rob , instead , started off at full speed , running as no man else in the county could run , to fetch the doctor to the castle .
Parsing [sent. 8952 len. 29]: At the chief 's desire , they made a hurried meal , and then resumed the loading of the carts , preparing one of them for his transport .
Parsing [sent. 8953 len. 64]: When it was half full , they covered the peats with a layer of dry elastic turf , then made on that a bed of heather , tops uppermost ; and more to please them than that he could not walk , Alister consented to be laid on this luxurious invalid-carriage , and borne home over the rough roads like a disabled warrior .
Parsing [sent. 8954 len. 8]: They arrived some time before the doctor .
Parsing [sent. 8955 len. 6]: CHAPTER XV A DARING VISIT .
Parsing [sent. 8956 len. 55]: Mercy soon learned that some sort of encounter had taken place between her father 's shooting party and some of the clan ; also that the chief was hurt , but not in what manner -- for by silent agreement that was not mentioned : it might seem to put them in the wrong !
Parsing [sent. 8957 len. 13]: She had heard enough , however , to fill her with anxiety .
Parsing [sent. 8958 len. 20]: Her window commanding the ridge by the castle , she seated herself to watch that point with her opera-glass .
Parsing [sent. 8959 len. 31]: When the hill-party came from behind the ruin , she missed his tall figure amongst his people , and presently discovered him lying very white on one of the carts .
Parsing [sent. 8960 len. 8]: Her heart became as water within her .
Parsing [sent. 8961 len. 13]: But instant contriving how she could reach him , kept her up .
Parsing [sent. 8962 len. 23]: By and by Christina came to tell her she had just heard from one of the servants that the Macruadh was shot .
Parsing [sent. 8963 len. 15]: Mercy , having seen him alive , heard the frightful news with tolerable calmness .
Parsing [sent. 8964 len. 29]: Christina said she would do her best to discover before the morning how much he was hurt ; no one in the house seemed able to tell her !
Parsing [sent. 8965 len. 17]: Mercy , to avoid implicating her sister , held her peace as to her own intention .
Parsing [sent. 8966 len. 19]: As soon as it was dark she prepared to steal from the house , dreading nothing but prevention .
Parsing [sent. 8967 len. 78]: When her dinner was brought her , and she knew they were all safe in the dining-room , she drew her plaid over her head , and leaving her food untasted , stole half down the stair , whence watching her opportunity between the comings and goings of the waiting servants , she presently got away unseen , crept softly past the windows , and when out of the shrubbery , darted off at her full speed .
Parsing [sent. 8968 len. 17]: Her breath was all but gone when she knocked at the drawing-room door of the cottage .
Parsing [sent. 8969 len. 12]: It opened , and there stood the mother of her chief !
Parsing [sent. 8970 len. 47]: The moment Mrs. Macruadh saw her , leaving her no time to say a word , she bore down upon her like one vessel that would sink another , pushing her from the door , and pulling it to behind her , stern as righteous Fate .
Parsing [sent. 8971 len. 17]: Mercy was not going to be put down , however : she was doing nothing wrong !
Parsing [sent. 8972 len. 9]: `` How is the Macruadh , please ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8973 len. 5]: she managed to say .
Parsing [sent. 8974 len. 42]: `` Alive , but terribly hurt , '' answered his mother , and would have borne her out of the open door of the cottage , towards the latch of which she reached her hand while yet a yard from it .
Parsing [sent. 8975 len. 14]: Her action said , `` Why WILL Nancy leave the door open ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8976 len. 10]: `` Please , please , what is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8977 len. 7]: panted Mercy , standing her ground .
Parsing [sent. 8978 len. 7]: `` How is he hurt ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8979 len. 7]: She turned upon her almost fiercely .
Parsing [sent. 8980 len. 11]: `` This is what YOU have done for him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8981 len. 8]: she said , with right ungenerous reproach .
Parsing [sent. 8982 len. 22]: `` Your father fired at him , on my son 's own land , and shot him in the chest . ''
Parsing [sent. 8983 len. 7]: `` Is he in danger ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8984 len. 16]: gasped Mercy , leaning against the wall , and trembling so she could scarcely stand .
Parsing [sent. 8985 len. 9]: `` I fear he is in GREAT danger .
Parsing [sent. 8986 len. 8]: If only the doctor would come ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8987 len. 15]: `` You would n't mind my sitting in the kitchen till he does ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8988 len. 9]: whispered Mercy , her voice all but gone .
Parsing [sent. 8989 len. 7]: `` I could not allow it .
Parsing [sent. 8990 len. 15]: I will not connive at your coming here without the knowledge of your parents !
Parsing [sent. 8991 len. 16]: It is not at all a proper thing for a young lady to do ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8992 len. 8]: `` Then I will wait outside ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8993 len. 24]: said Mercy , her quick temper waking in spite of her anxiety : she had anticipated coldness , but not treatment like this !
Parsing [sent. 8994 len. 27]: `` There is one , I think , Mrs. Macruadh , '' she added , `` who will not find fault with me for it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8995 len. 14]: `` At least he will not tell you so for some time ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8996 len. 13]: The door had not been quite closed , and it opened noiselessly .
Parsing [sent. 8997 len. 19]: `` She does not mean me , mother , '' said Alister ; `` she means Jesus Christ .
Parsing [sent. 8998 len. 10]: He would say to you , LET HER ALONE .
Parsing [sent. 8999 len. 7]: He does not care for Society .
Parsing [sent. 9000 len. 13]: Its ways are not his ways , nor its laws his laws .
Parsing [sent. 9001 len. 5]: Come in , Mercy .
Parsing [sent. 9002 len. 18]: I am sorry my mother 's trouble about me should have made her inhospitable to you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9003 len. 17]: `` I can not come in , Alister , if she will not let me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9004 len. 3]: answered Mercy .
Parsing [sent. 9005 len. 6]: `` Pray walk in ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9006 len. 4]: said Mrs. Macruadh .
Parsing [sent. 9007 len. 23]: She would have passed Mercy , going toward the kitchen , but the TRANCE was narrow , and Mercy did not move .
Parsing [sent. 9008 len. 11]: `` You see , Alister , I can not ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9009 len. 3]: she insisted .
Parsing [sent. 9010 len. 10]: `` That would not please , would it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9011 len. 4]: she added reverently .
Parsing [sent. 9012 len. 18]: `` Tell me how you are , and I will go , and come again to-morrow . ''
Parsing [sent. 9013 len. 22]: Alister told her what had befallen , making little of the affair , and saying he suspected it was an accident .
Parsing [sent. 9014 len. 7]: `` Oh , thank you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9015 len. 9]: she said , with a sigh of relief .
Parsing [sent. 9016 len. 28]: `` I meant to sit by the castle wall till the doctor came ; but now I shall get back before they discover I am gone . ''
Parsing [sent. 9017 len. 21]: Without a word more , she turned and ran from the house , and reached her room unmissed and unseen .
Parsing [sent. 9018 len. 19]: The next was a dreary hour -- the most painful that mother and son had ever passed together .
Parsing [sent. 9019 len. 33]: The mother was all this time buttressing her pride with her grief , and the son was cut to the heart that he should have had to take part against his mother .
Parsing [sent. 9020 len. 29]: But when the doctor came at length , and the mother saw him take out his instruments , the pride that parted her from her boy melted away .
Parsing [sent. 9021 len. 7]: `` Forgive me , Alister ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9022 len. 12]: she whispered ; and his happy kiss comforted her repentant soul .
Parsing [sent. 9023 len. 27]: When the small operations were over , and Alister was in bed , she would have gone to let Mercy know all she could tell her .
Parsing [sent. 9024 len. 13]: But she must not : it would work mischief in the house !
Parsing [sent. 9025 len. 14]: She sat down by Alister 's bedside , and watched him all night .
Parsing [sent. 9026 len. 36]: He slept well , being in such a healthful condition of body that his loss of blood , and the presence of the few shot that could not be found , did him little harm .
Parsing [sent. 9027 len. 41]: He yielded to his mother 's entreaties to spend the morning in bed , but was up long before the evening in the hope of Mercy 's coming , confident that his mother would now be like herself to her .
Parsing [sent. 9028 len. 36]: She came ; the mother took her in her arms , and begged her forgiveness ; nor , having thus embraced her , could she any more treat her relation to her son with coldness .
Parsing [sent. 9029 len. 33]: If the girl was ready , as her conduct showed , to leave all for Alister , she had saved her soul alive , she was no more one of the enemy !
Parsing [sent. 9030 len. 35]: Thus was the mother repaid for her righteous education of her son : through him her pride received almost a mortal blow , her justice grew more discriminating , and her righteousness more generous .
Parsing [sent. 9031 len. 14]: In a few days the chief was out , and looking quite himself .
Parsing [sent. 9032 len. 5]: CHAPTER XVI THE FLITTING .
Parsing [sent. 9033 len. 60]: The time was drawing nigh when the warning of ejection would doubtless begin to be put in force ; and the chief hearing , through Rob of the Angels , that attempts were making to stir the people up , determined to render them futile : they must be a trick of the enemy to get them into trouble !
Parsing [sent. 9034 len. 39]: Taking counsel therefore with the best of the villagers , both women and men , he was confirmed in the idea that they had better all remove together , before the limit of the earliest notice was expired .
Parsing [sent. 9035 len. 27]: But his councillors agreed with him that the people should not be told to get themselves in readiness except at a moment 's notice to move .
Parsing [sent. 9036 len. 13]: In the meantime he pushed on their labour at the new village .
Parsing [sent. 9037 len. 77]: In the afternoon preceding the day on which certain of the clan were to be the first cast out of their homes , the chief went to the village , and going from house to house , told his people to have everything in order for flitting that very night , so that in the morning there should not be an old shoe left behind ; and to let no rumour of their purpose get abroad .
Parsing [sent. 9038 len. 25]: They would thus have a good laugh at the enemy , who was reported to have applied for military assistance as a precautionary measure .
Parsing [sent. 9039 len. 32]: His horses should be ready , and as soon as it was dark they would begin to cart and carry , and be snug in their new houses before the morning !
Parsing [sent. 9040 len. 10]: All agreed , and a tumult of preparation began .
Parsing [sent. 9041 len. 21]: `` Lady Macruadh '' came with help and counsel , and took the children in charge while the mothers bustled .
Parsing [sent. 9042 len. 18]: It was amazing how much had to be done to remove so small an amount of property .
Parsing [sent. 9043 len. 18]: The chief 's three carts were first laden ; then the men and women loaded each other .
Parsing [sent. 9044 len. 19]: The chief took on his hack the biggest load of all , except indeed it were Hector 's .
Parsing [sent. 9045 len. 59]: To and fro went the carts , and to and fro went the men and women , I know not how many journeys , upheld by companionship , merriment , hope , and the clan-mother 's plentiful provision of tea , coffee , milk , bread and butter , cold mutton and ham -- luxurious fare to all .
Parsing [sent. 9046 len. 81]: As the sun was rising they closed every door , and walked for the last time , laden with the last of their goods , out of the place of their oppression , leaving behind them not a cock to crow , a peat to burn , or a scrap that was worth stealing -- all removed in such order and silence that not one , even at the New House , had a suspicion of what was going on .
Parsing [sent. 9047 len. 93]: Mercy , indeed , as she sat looking from her window like Daniel praying toward Jerusalem , her constant custom now , even when there was no moon to show what lay before her , did think she heard strange sounds come faintly through the night from the valley below -- even thought she caught shadowy glimpses of a shapeless , gnome-like train moving along the road ; but she only wondered if the Highlands had suddenly gifted her with the second sight , and these were the brain-phantasms of coming events .
Parsing [sent. 9048 len. 16]: She listened and gazed , but could not be sure that she heard or saw .
Parsing [sent. 9049 len. 32]: When she looked out in the morning , however , she understood , for the castle-ridge was almost hidden in the smoke that poured from every chimney of the new village .
Parsing [sent. 9050 len. 25]: Her heart swelled with joy to think of her chief with all his people under his eyes , and within reach of his voice .
Parsing [sent. 9051 len. 26]: From her window they seemed so many friends gathered to comfort her solitude , or the camp of an army come to set her free .
Parsing [sent. 9052 len. 28]: Hector and Rob , with one or two more of the clan , hid themselves to watch those who came to evict the first of the villagers .
Parsing [sent. 9053 len. 5]: There were no military .
Parsing [sent. 9054 len. 20]: Two sheriff 's officers , a good many constables , and a few vagabonds , made up the party .
Parsing [sent. 9055 len. 46]: Rob 's keen eye enabled him to distinguish the very moment when first they began to be aware of something unusual about the place ; he saw them presently halt and look at each other as if the duty before them were not altogether CANNY .
Parsing [sent. 9056 len. 55]: At no time would there be many signs of life in the poor hamlet , but there would always be some sounds of handicraft , some shuttle or hammer going , some cries of children weeping or at play , some noises of animals , some ascending smoke , some issuing or entering shape !
Parsing [sent. 9057 len. 9]: They feared an ambush , a sudden onslaught .
Parsing [sent. 9058 len. 42]: Warily they stepped into the place , sharply and warily they looked about them in the street , slowly and with circumspection they opened door after door , afraid of what might be lurking behind to pounce upon them at unawares .
Parsing [sent. 9059 len. 28]: Only after searching every house , and discovering not the smallest sign of the presence of living creature , did they recognize their fool 's - errand .
Parsing [sent. 9060 len. 30]: And all the time there was the new village , smoking hard , under the very windows , as he chose himself to say , of its chief adversary !
Parsing [sent. 9061 len. 6]: CHAPTER XVII THE NEW VILLAGE .
Parsing [sent. 9062 len. 21]: The winter came down upon them early , and the chief and his mother had a sore time of it .
Parsing [sent. 9063 len. 21]: Well as they had known it before , the poverty of their people was far better understood by them now .
Parsing [sent. 9064 len. 27]: Unable to endure the sight of it , and spending more and more to meet it , they saw it impossible for them to hold out .
Parsing [sent. 9065 len. 49]: For a long time their succour had been draining if not exhausting the poor resources of the chief ; he had borne up in the hope of the money he was so soon to receive ; and now there was none , and the need greater than ever !
Parsing [sent. 9066 len. 44]: He was not troubled , for his faith was simple and strong ; but his faith made him the more desirous of doing his part for the coming deliverance : faith in God compels and enables a man to be fellow-worker with God .
Parsing [sent. 9067 len. 42]: He was now waiting the judgment of Ian concerning the prospects of the settlers in that part of Canada to which he had gone , hoping it might help him to some resolve in view of the worse difficulties at hand .
Parsing [sent. 9068 len. 21]: In the meantime the clan was more comfortable , and passed the winter more happily , than for many years .
Parsing [sent. 9069 len. 14]: First of all , they had access to the chief at any moment .
Parsing [sent. 9070 len. 36]: Then he had prepared a room in his own house where were always fire and light for such as would read what books he was able to lend them , or play at quiet games .
Parsing [sent. 9071 len. 8]: To them its humble arrangements were sumptuous .
Parsing [sent. 9072 len. 42]: And best of all , he would , in the long dark fore-nights , as the lowland Scotch call them , read aloud , at one time in Gaelic , at another in English , things that gave them great delight .
Parsing [sent. 9073 len. 15]: Donal shoemaker was filled with joy unutterable by the Rime of the Ancient Mariner .
Parsing [sent. 9074 len. 22]: If only this state of things could be kept up -- with Ian back , and Mercy married to the chief !
Parsing [sent. 9075 len. 4]: thought the mother .
Parsing [sent. 9076 len. 13]: But it was not to be ; that grew plainer every day .
Parsing [sent. 9077 len. 44]: Mr. Palmer would gladly have spent his winter elsewhere , leaving his family behind him ; but as things were , he could not leave them , and as certain other things were , he did not care to take them to London .
Parsing [sent. 9078 len. 38]: Besides , for them all to leave now , would be to confess defeat ; and who could tell what hurt to his forest might not follow in his absence from the cowardly hatred of the peasants !
Parsing [sent. 9079 len. 9]: He was resolved to see the thing out .
Parsing [sent. 9080 len. 18]: But above all , he must keep that worthless girl , Mercy , under his own eye !
Parsing [sent. 9081 len. 10]: `` That 's what comes of NOT drinking ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9082 len. 25]: he would say to himself ; `` a man grows as proud as Satan , and makes himself a curse to his neighbours ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9083 len. 11]: Then he would sigh like a man ill-used and disconsolate .
Parsing [sent. 9084 len. 32]: Both Mercy and the chief thought it better not to venture much , but they did occasionally contrive to meet for a few minutes -- by the help of Christina generally .
Parsing [sent. 9085 len. 27]: Twice only was Mercy 's handkerchief hung from the window , when her longing for his voice had grown almost too strong for her to bear .
Parsing [sent. 9086 len. 21]: The signal brought him both times through the wild wintry storm , joyous as a bird through the summer air .
Parsing [sent. 9087 len. 50]: Once or twice they met just outside the gate , Mercy flying like a snow-bird to the tryst , and as swiftly back through the keen blue frost , when her breath as she ran seemed to linger in the air like smoke , and threaten to betray her .
Parsing [sent. 9088 len. 22]: At length came the much desired letter from Ian , full of matter for the enabling of the chief 's decision .
Parsing [sent. 9089 len. 65]: Two things had long been clear to Alister -- that , even if the ground he had could keep his people alive , it certainly could not keep them all employed ; and that , if they went elsewhere , especially to any town , it might induce for many , and ensure for their children , a lamentable descent in the moral scale .
Parsing [sent. 9090 len. 12]: He was their shepherd , and must lose none of them !
Parsing [sent. 9091 len. 14]: therefore , first of all , he must not lose sight of them !
Parsing [sent. 9092 len. 55]: It was now clear also , that the best and most desirable thing was , that the poor remnant of the clan should leave their native country , and betake themselves where not a few of their own people , among them Lachlan and Annie , would welcome them to probable ease and comfort .
Parsing [sent. 9093 len. 15]: There he would buy land , settle with them , and build a village .
Parsing [sent. 9094 len. 23]: Some would cultivate the soil under their chief ; others would pursue their trades for the good of the community and themselves !
Parsing [sent. 9095 len. 28]: And now came once more the love of land face to face with the love of men , and in the chief 's heart paled before it .
Parsing [sent. 9096 len. 21]: For there was but one way to get the needful money : the last of the Macruadh property must go !
Parsing [sent. 9097 len. 34]: Not for one moment did it rouse a grudging thought in the chief : it was for the sake of the men and women and children whose lives would be required of him !
Parsing [sent. 9098 len. 19]: The land itself must yield , them wings to forsake it withal , and fly beyond the sea !
Parsing [sent. 9099 len. 49]: CHAPTER XVIII A FRIENDLY OFFER It was agreed between mother and son to submit the matter to Ian , and if he should , be of the same mind , at once to negotiate the sale of the land , in order to carry the clan to Canada .
Parsing [sent. 9100 len. 14]: They wrote therefore to Ian , and composed themselves to await his answer .
Parsing [sent. 9101 len. 42]: It was a sorrowful thing to Alister to seem for a moment to follow the example of the recreant chiefs whose defection to feudalism was the prelude to their treachery toward their people , and whose faithlessness had ruined the highlands .
Parsing [sent. 9102 len. 40]: But unlike Glengarry or `` Esau '' Reay , he desired to sell his land that he might keep his people , care for them , and share with them : his people safe , what mattered the acres !
Parsing [sent. 9103 len. 43]: Reflecting on the thing , he saw , in the case of Ian 's approval of the sale , no reason why he should not show friendliness where none was expected , and give Mr. Peregrine Palmer the first chance of purchase .
Parsing [sent. 9104 len. 50]: He thought also , with his usual hopefulness , that the time might come when the clan , laying its savings together , would be able to redeem its ancient homesteads , and then it might be an advantage that they were all in the possession of one man .
Parsing [sent. 9105 len. 10]: Such things had been , and might be again !
Parsing [sent. 9106 len. 16]: The Lord could bring again the captivity of Clanruahd as well as that of Zion !
Parsing [sent. 9107 len. 31]: Two months passed , and they had Ian 's answer -- when it was well on into the spring , and weather good for a sea-voyage was upon its way .
Parsing [sent. 9108 len. 33]: Because of the loss of their uncle 's money , and the good prospect of comfort in return for labour , hard but not killing , Ian entirely approved of the proposal .
Parsing [sent. 9109 len. 18]: From that moment the thing was no longer discussed , but how best to carry it out .
Parsing [sent. 9110 len. 26]: The chief assembled the clan in the barn , read his brother 's letter , and in a simple speech acquainted them with the situation .
Parsing [sent. 9111 len. 99]: He told them of the loss of the money to which he had looked for the power to aid them ; reminded them that there was neither employment nor subsistence enough on the land -- not even if his mother and he were to live like the rest of them , which if necessary they were quite prepared to do ; and stated his resolve to part with the remnant of it in order to provide the means of their migrating in a body to Canada , where not a few old friends were eager to welcome them .
Parsing [sent. 9112 len. 38]: There they would buy land , he said , of which every man that would cultivate it should have a portion enough to live upon , while those with trades should have every facility for following them .
Parsing [sent. 9113 len. 25]: All , he believed , would fare well in return for hard work , and they would be in the power of no man .
Parsing [sent. 9114 len. 53]: There was even a possibility , he hoped , that , if they lived and laboured well , they might one day buy back the home they had left ; or if not they , their sons and daughters might return from their captivity , and restore the house of their fathers .
Parsing [sent. 9115 len. 15]: If anyone would not go , he would do for him what seemed fair .
Parsing [sent. 9116 len. 58]: Donal shoemaker rose , unpuckered his face , slackened the purse-strings of his mouth , and said , `` Where my chief goes , I will go ; where my chief lives , I will live ; and where my chief is buried , God grant I may be buried also , with all my family ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9117 len. 16]: He sat down , covered his face with his hands , and wept and sobbed .
Parsing [sent. 9118 len. 14]: One voice rose from all present : `` We 'll go , Macruadh !
Parsing [sent. 9119 len. 4]: We 'll go !
Parsing [sent. 9120 len. 7]: Our chief is our home ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9121 len. 39]: The chief 's heart swelled with mingled gladness and grief , but he answered quietly , `` Then you must at once begin your preparations ; we ought not to be in a hurry at the last . ''
Parsing [sent. 9122 len. 10]: An immediate stir , movement , bustle , followed .
Parsing [sent. 9123 len. 19]: There was much talking , and many sunny faces , over which kept sweeping the clouds of sorrow .
Parsing [sent. 9124 len. 18]: The next morning the chief went to the New House , and desired to see Mr. Palmer .
Parsing [sent. 9125 len. 12]: He was shown into what the new laird called his study .
Parsing [sent. 9126 len. 20]: Mr. Palmer 's first thought was that he had come to call him to account for firing at him .
Parsing [sent. 9127 len. 11]: He neither spoke nor advanced a step to meet him .
Parsing [sent. 9128 len. 30]: The chief stood still some yards from him , and said as pleasantly as he could , -- `` You are surprised to see me , Mr. Palmer ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9129 len. 5]: `` I am . ''
Parsing [sent. 9130 len. 15]: `` I come to ask if you would like to buy my land ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9131 len. 4]: `` Already ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9132 len. 19]: said Mr. Palmer , cast on his enemy a glare of victory , and so stood regarding him .
Parsing [sent. 9133 len. 6]: The chief did not reply .
Parsing [sent. 9134 len. 4]: `` Well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9135 len. 4]: said Mr. Palmer .
Parsing [sent. 9136 len. 11]: `` I wait your answer , '' returned the chief .
Parsing [sent. 9137 len. 15]: `` Did it never strike you that insolence might be carried too far ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9138 len. 23]: `` I came for your sake more than my own , '' rejoined the chief , without even a shadow of anger .
Parsing [sent. 9139 len. 24]: `` I have no particular desire you should take the land , but thought it reasonable you should have the first offer . ''
Parsing [sent. 9140 len. 13]: `` What a dull ox the fellow must take me for ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9141 len. 7]: remarked the new laird to himself .
Parsing [sent. 9142 len. 12]: `` It 's all a dodge to get into the house !
Parsing [sent. 9143 len. 9]: As if he would sell ME his land !
Parsing [sent. 9144 len. 11]: Or could think I would hold any communication with him !
Parsing [sent. 9145 len. 4]: Buy his land !
Parsing [sent. 9146 len. 11]: It 's some trick , I 'll lay my soul !
Parsing [sent. 9147 len. 4]: The infernal scoundrel !
Parsing [sent. 9148 len. 6]: Such a mean-spirited wretch too !
Parsing [sent. 9149 len. 23]: Takes an ounce of shot in the stomach , and never says ` What the devil do you mean by it ? '
Parsing [sent. 9150 len. 11]: I do n't believe the savage ever felt it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9151 len. 37]: Something like this passed with thought 's own swiftness through the mind of Mr. Palmer , as he stood looking the chief from head to foot , yet in his inmost person feeling small before him .
Parsing [sent. 9152 len. 29]: `` If you can not at once make up your mind , '' said Alister , `` I will give you till to-morrow to think it over . ''
Parsing [sent. 9153 len. 32]: `` When you have learned to behave like a gentleman , '' answered the new laird , `` let me know , and I will refer you to my factor . ''
Parsing [sent. 9154 len. 7]: He turned and rang the hell .
Parsing [sent. 9155 len. 11]: Alister bowed , and did not wait for the servant .
Parsing [sent. 9156 len. 27]: It must be said for Mr. Palmer , however , that that morning Christina had positively refused to listen to a word more from Mr. Sercombe .
Parsing [sent. 9157 len. 10]: In the afternoon , Alister set out for London .
Parsing [sent. 9158 len. 5]: CHAPTER XIX ANOTHER EXPULSION .
Parsing [sent. 9159 len. 17]: Mr. Peregrine Palmer brooded more and more upon what he counted the contempt of the chief .
Parsing [sent. 9160 len. 9]: It became in him almost a fixed idea .
Parsing [sent. 9161 len. 43]: It had already sent out several suckers , and had , amongst others , developed the notion that he was despised by those from whom first of all he looked for the appreciation after which his soul thirsted -- his own family .
Parsing [sent. 9162 len. 15]: He grew therefore yet more moody , and his moodiness and distrust developed suspicion .
Parsing [sent. 9163 len. 20]: It is scarce credible what a crushing influence the judgment he pretended to scorn , thus exercised upon him .
Parsing [sent. 9164 len. 59]: It was not that he acknowledged in it the smallest justice ; neither was it that he cared altogether for what such a fanatical fool as the chief might think ; but he reflected that if one could so despise his money because of its source , there might be others , might be many who did so .
Parsing [sent. 9165 len. 56]: At the same time , had he been sure of the approbation of all the world beside , it would have troubled him not a little , in his thirst after recognition , that any gentleman , one of family especially , however old-fashioned and absurd he might be , should look down upon him .
Parsing [sent. 9166 len. 43]: His smouldering , causelessly excited anger , his evident struggle to throw off an oppression , and the fierce resentment of the chief 's judgment which he would now and then betray , revealed how closely the offence clung to his consciousness .
Parsing [sent. 9167 len. 62]: Flattering himself from her calmness that Mercy had got over her foolish liking for the `` boor , '' as he would not unfrequently style the chief , he had listened to the prayers of her mother , and submitted to her company at the dinner-table ; but he continued to treat her as one who had committed a shameful fault .
Parsing [sent. 9168 len. 21]: That evening , the great little man could hardly eat for recurrent wrathful memories of the interview of the morning .
Parsing [sent. 9169 len. 22]: Perhaps his most painful reflection was that he had not been quick enough to embrace the opportunity of annihilating his enemy .
Parsing [sent. 9170 len. 26]: Thunder lowered portentous in his black brows , and not until he had drunk several glasses of wine did a word come from his lips .
Parsing [sent. 9171 len. 9]: His presence was purgatory without the purifying element .
Parsing [sent. 9172 len. 15]: `` What do you think that fellow has been here about this morning ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9173 len. 5]: he said at length .
Parsing [sent. 9174 len. 5]: `` What fellow ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9175 len. 17]: asked his wife unnecessarily , for she knew what visitor had been shown into the study .
Parsing [sent. 9176 len. 22]: `` The highland fellow , '' he answered , `` that claims to do what he pleases on my property ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9177 len. 7]: Mercy 's face grew hot . ''
Parsing [sent. 9178 len. 12]: -- Came actually to offer me the refusal of his land !
Parsing [sent. 9179 len. 13]: -- the merest trick to get into the house -- confound him !
Parsing [sent. 9180 len. 22]: As much as told me , if I did not buy it off-hand , I should not have the chance again !
Parsing [sent. 9181 len. 6]: The cheek of the brute !
Parsing [sent. 9182 len. 32]: To dare show his face in my house after trifling with my daughter 's affections on the pretence that he could not marry a girl whose father was in trade ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9183 len. 26]: Mercy felt she would be false to the man she loved , and whom she knew to be true , if she did not speak .
Parsing [sent. 9184 len. 15]: She had no thought of defending him , but simply of witnessing to him .
Parsing [sent. 9185 len. 21]: `` I beg your pardon , papa , '' she said , `` but the Macruadh never trifled with me .
Parsing [sent. 9186 len. 11]: He loves me , and has not given me up .
Parsing [sent. 9187 len. 34]: If he told you he was going to part with his land , he is going to part with it , and came to you first because he must return good for evil .
Parsing [sent. 9188 len. 20]: I saw him from my window ride off as if he were going to meet the afternoon coach . ''
Parsing [sent. 9189 len. 20]: She would not have been allowed to say so much , had not her father been speechless with rage .
Parsing [sent. 9190 len. 11]: This was more than he or any man could bear !
Parsing [sent. 9191 len. 10]: He rose from the table , his eyes blazing .
Parsing [sent. 9192 len. 8]: `` Return ME good for evil ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9193 len. 22]: he exclaimed ; '' -- a beast who has done me more wrong than ever I did in all my life !
Parsing [sent. 9194 len. 18]: a scoundrel bumpkin who loses not an opportunity of insulting me as never was man insulted before !
Parsing [sent. 9195 len. 10]: You are an insolent , heartless , depraved girl !
Parsing [sent. 9196 len. 25]: -- ready to sacrifice yourself , body and soul , to a man who despises you and yours with the pride of a savage !
Parsing [sent. 9197 len. 13]: You hussey , I can scarce keep my hands off you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9198 len. 9]: He came toward her with a threatful stride .
Parsing [sent. 9199 len. 13]: She rose , pushed back her chair , and stood facing him .
Parsing [sent. 9200 len. 30]: `` Strike me , '' she said with a choking voice , `` if you will , papa ; but mamma knows I am not what you call me !
Parsing [sent. 9201 len. 42]: I should be false and cowardly if I did not speak the truth for the man to whom I owe '' -- she was going to say `` more than to any other human being , '' but she checked herself .
Parsing [sent. 9202 len. 32]: `` If the beggar is your god , '' said her father , and struck her on the cheek with his open hand , `` you can go to him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9203 len. 43]: He took her by the arm , and pushed her before him out of the room , and across the hall ; then opening the door , shoved her from him into the garden , and flung the door to behind her .
Parsing [sent. 9204 len. 29]: The rain was falling in torrents , the night was very dark , and when the door shut , she felt as if she had lost her eyesight .
Parsing [sent. 9205 len. 4]: It was terrible !
Parsing [sent. 9206 len. 10]: -- but , thank God , she was free !
Parsing [sent. 9207 len. 52]: Without a moment 's hesitation -- while her mother wept and pleaded , Christina stood burning with indignation , the two little ones sat white with open mouths , and the servants hurried about scared , but trying to look as if nothing had happened -- Mercy fled into the dark .
Parsing [sent. 9208 len. 51]: She stumbled into the shrubbery several times , but at last reached the gate , and while they imagined her standing before the house waiting to be let in , was running from it as from the jaws of the pit , in terror of a voice calling her back .
Parsing [sent. 9209 len. 26]: The pouring rain was sweet to her whole indignant person , and especially to the cheek where burned the brand of her father 's blow .
Parsing [sent. 9210 len. 19]: The way was deep in mud , and she slipped and fell more than once as she ran .
Parsing [sent. 9211 len. 40]: Mrs. Macruadh was sitting in the little parlour , no one but Nancy in the house , when the door opened , and in came the wild-looking girl , draggled and spent , and dropped kneeling at her feet .
Parsing [sent. 9212 len. 14]: Great masses of long black hair hung dripping with rain about her shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 9213 len. 20]: Her dress was torn and wet , and soiled with clay from the road and earth from the shrubbery .
Parsing [sent. 9214 len. 15]: One cheek was white , and the other had a red patch on it .
Parsing [sent. 9215 len. 6]: `` My poor child ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9216 len. 9]: cried the mother ; `` what has happened ?
Parsing [sent. 9217 len. 5]: Alister is away ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9218 len. 9]: `` I know that , '' panted Mercy .
Parsing [sent. 9219 len. 24]: `` I saw him go , but I thought you would take me in -- though you do not like me much ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9220 len. 9]: `` Not like you , my child ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9221 len. 5]: echoed the mother tenderly .
Parsing [sent. 9222 len. 5]: `` I love you !
Parsing [sent. 9223 len. 8]: Are you not my Alister 's choice ?
Parsing [sent. 9224 len. 22]: There are things I could have wished otherwise , but -- '' `` Well could I wish them otherwise too ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9225 len. 3]: interposed Mercy .
Parsing [sent. 9226 len. 43]: `` I do not wish another father ; and I am not quite able to wish he had n't struck me and put me out into the dark and the rain , but -- '' `` Struck you and put you out !
Parsing [sent. 9227 len. 3]: My child !
Parsing [sent. 9228 len. 8]: What did he do it for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9229 len. 18]: `` Perhaps I deserved it : it is difficult to know how to behave to a father !
Parsing [sent. 9230 len. 28]: A father is supposed to be one whom you not only love , as I do mine , but of whom you can be proud as well !
Parsing [sent. 9231 len. 19]: I ca n't be proud of mine , and do n't know quite how to behave to him .
Parsing [sent. 9232 len. 38]: Perhaps I ought to have held my peace , but when he said things that were not -- not correct about Alister , misinterpreting him altogether , I felt it cowardly and false to hold my tongue .
Parsing [sent. 9233 len. 13]: So I said I did not believe that was what Alister meant .
Parsing [sent. 9234 len. 16]: It is but a quarter of an hour ago , and it looks a fortnight !
Parsing [sent. 9235 len. 13]: I do n't think I quite know what I am saying ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9236 len. 22]: She ceased , laid her head on Mrs. Macruadh 's knee , then sank to the floor , and lay motionless .
Parsing [sent. 9237 len. 20]: All the compassion of the woman , all the protective pride of the chieftainess , woke in the mother .
Parsing [sent. 9238 len. 29]: She raised the girl in her arms , and vowed that not one of her house should set eyes on her again without the consent of her son .
Parsing [sent. 9239 len. 12]: He should see how his mother cared for what was his !
Parsing [sent. 9240 len. 18]: -- how wide her arms , how big her heart , to take in what he loved !
Parsing [sent. 9241 len. 20]: Dear to him , the daughter of the man she despised should be as the apple of her eye !
Parsing [sent. 9242 len. 31]: They would of course repent and want her back , but they should not have her ; neither should a sound of threat or demand reach the darling 's ears .
Parsing [sent. 9243 len. 13]: She should be in peace until Alister came to determine her future .
Parsing [sent. 9244 len. 14]: There was the mark of the wicked hand on the sweet sallow cheek !
Parsing [sent. 9245 len. 16]: She was not beautiful , but she would love her the more to make up !
Parsing [sent. 9246 len. 17]: Thank God , they had turned her out , and that made her free of them !
Parsing [sent. 9247 len. 12]: They should not have her again ; Alister should have her !
Parsing [sent. 9248 len. 9]: -- and from the hand of his mother !
Parsing [sent. 9249 len. 14]: She got her to bed , and sent for Rob of the Angels .
Parsing [sent. 9250 len. 42]: With injunctions to silence , she told him to fetch his father , and be ready as soon as possible to drive a cart to the chief 's cave , there to make everything comfortable for herself and Miss Mercy Palmer .
Parsing [sent. 9251 len. 20]: Mercy slept well , and as the day was breaking Mrs. Macruadh woke her and helped her to dress .
Parsing [sent. 9252 len. 27]: Then they walked together through the lovely spring morning to the turn of the valley-road , where a cart was waiting them , half-filled with oat-straw .
Parsing [sent. 9253 len. 21]: They got in , and were borne up and up at a walking-pace to the spot Mercy knew so well .
Parsing [sent. 9254 len. 28]: Never by swiftest coach had she enjoyed a journey so much as that slow crawl up the mountains in the rough springless cart of her ploughman lover !
Parsing [sent. 9255 len. 11]: She felt so protected , so happy , so hopeful .
Parsing [sent. 9256 len. 18]: Alister 's mother was indeed a hiding place from the wind , a covert from the tempest !
Parsing [sent. 9257 len. 16]: Having consented to be her mother , she could mother her no way but entirely .
Parsing [sent. 9258 len. 24]: An outcast for the sake of her Alister , she should have the warmest corner of her heart next to him and Ian !
Parsing [sent. 9259 len. 50]: Into the tomb they went , and found everything strangely comfortable -- the stone-floor covered with warm and woolly skins of black-faced sheep , a great fire glowing , plenty of provisions hung and stored , and the deaf , keen-eyed father with the swift keen-eared son for attendants .
Parsing [sent. 9260 len. 18]: `` You will not mind sharing your bed with me -- will you , my child ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9261 len. 10]: said Mrs. Macruadh : `` Our accommodation is scanty .
Parsing [sent. 9262 len. 8]: But we shall be safe from intrusion .
Parsing [sent. 9263 len. 11]: Only those two faithful men know where we are . ''
Parsing [sent. 9264 len. 8]: `` Mother will be terribly frightened ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9265 len. 3]: said Mercy .
Parsing [sent. 9266 len. 28]: `` I thought of that , and left a note with Nancy , telling her you were safe and well , but giving no hint of where .
Parsing [sent. 9267 len. 21]: I said that her dove had flown to my bosom for shelter , and there she should have it . ''
Parsing [sent. 9268 len. 7]: Mercy answered with a passionate embrace .
Parsing [sent. 9269 len. 6]: CHAPTER XX ALISTER 'S PRINCESS .
Parsing [sent. 9270 len. 9]: Ten peaceful days they spent in the cave-house .
Parsing [sent. 9271 len. 23]: It was cold outside , but the clear air of the hill-top was delicious , and inside it was warm and dry .
Parsing [sent. 9272 len. 17]: There were plenty of books , and Mercy never felt the time a moment too long .
Parsing [sent. 9273 len. 35]: The mother talked freely of her sons , and of their father , of the history of the clan , of her own girlhood , and of the hopes and intentions of her sons .
Parsing [sent. 9274 len. 10]: `` Will you go with him , Mercy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9275 len. 9]: she asked , laying her hand on hers .
Parsing [sent. 9276 len. 25]: `` I would rather be his servant , '' answered Mercy , `` than remain at home : there is no life there ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9277 len. 31]: `` There is life wherever there is the will to live -- that is , to do the thing that is given one to do , '' said the mother .
Parsing [sent. 9278 len. 20]: In writing she told Alister nothing of what had happened : he might hurry home without completing his business !
Parsing [sent. 9279 len. 31]: Undisturbed by fresh anxiety , he settled everything , parted with his property to an old friend of the family , and received what would suffice for his further intents .
Parsing [sent. 9280 len. 43]: He also chartered a vessel to take them over the sea , and to save weariness and expense , arranged for it to go northward as far as a certain bay on the coast , and there take the clan on board .
Parsing [sent. 9281 len. 27]: When at length he reached home , Nancy informed him that his mother was at the hill-house , and begged he would go there to her .
Parsing [sent. 9282 len. 22]: He was a good deal perplexed : she very seldom went there , and had never before gone for the night !
Parsing [sent. 9283 len. 9]: and it was so early in the season !
Parsing [sent. 9284 len. 5]: He set out immediately .
Parsing [sent. 9285 len. 24]: It was twilight when he reached the top of the hill , and no light shone from the little windows of the tomb .
Parsing [sent. 9286 len. 42]: That day Mercy had been amusing her protectress with imitations , in which kind she had some gift , of certain of her London acquaintance : when the mother heard her son 's approaching step , a thought came to her .
Parsing [sent. 9287 len. 3]: `` Here !
Parsing [sent. 9288 len. 3]: Quick ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9289 len. 17]: she said ; `` Put on my cap and shawl , and sit in this chair .
Parsing [sent. 9290 len. 7]: I will go into the bedroom .
Parsing [sent. 9291 len. 7]: Then do as you like . ''
Parsing [sent. 9292 len. 48]: When the chief entered , he saw the form of his mother , as he thought , bending over the peat-fire , which had sunk rather low : in his imagination he saw again the form of his uncle as on that night in the low moonlight .
Parsing [sent. 9293 len. 11]: She did not move , did not even look up .
Parsing [sent. 9294 len. 22]: He stood still for a moment ; a strange feeling possessed him of something not being as it ought to be .
Parsing [sent. 9295 len. 28]: But he recovered himself with an effort , and kneeling beside her , put his arms round her -- not a little frightened at her continued silence .
Parsing [sent. 9296 len. 10]: `` What is the matter , mother dear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9297 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 9298 len. 12]: `` Why have you come up to this lonely place ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9299 len. 27]: When first Mercy felt his arms , she could not have spoken if she would -- her heart seemed to grow too large for her body .
Parsing [sent. 9300 len. 43]: But in a moment or two she controlled herself , and was able to say -- sufficiently in his mother 's tone and manner to keep up the initiated misconception : `` They put me out of the house , Alister . ''
Parsing [sent. 9301 len. 9]: `` Put you out of the house ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9302 len. 12]: he returned , like one hearing and talking in a dream .
Parsing [sent. 9303 len. 9]: `` Who dared interfere with you , mother ?
Parsing [sent. 9304 len. 6]: Am I losing my senses ?
Parsing [sent. 9305 len. 10]: I seem not to understand my own words ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9306 len. 5]: `` Mr. Palmer . ''
Parsing [sent. 9307 len. 4]: `` Mr. Palmer !
Parsing [sent. 9308 len. 11]: Was it to him I sold the land in London ?
Parsing [sent. 9309 len. 11]: What could he have to do with you , mother ?
Parsing [sent. 9310 len. 14]: How did they allow him to come near the house in my absence ?
Parsing [sent. 9311 len. 5]: Oh , I see !
Parsing [sent. 9312 len. 20]: He came and worried you so about Mercy that you were glad to take refuge from him up here !
Parsing [sent. 9313 len. 6]: -- I understand now ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9314 len. 20]: He ended in a tone of great relief : he felt as if he had just recovered his senses .
Parsing [sent. 9315 len. 8]: `` No , that was not it .
Parsing [sent. 9316 len. 18]: But we are going so soon , there would have been no good in fighting it out .
Parsing [sent. 9317 len. 10]: We ARE going soon , are we not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9318 len. 9]: `` Indeed we are , please God ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9319 len. 10]: replied the chief , who had relapsed into bewilderment .
Parsing [sent. 9320 len. 11]: `` That is well -- for you more than anybody .
Parsing [sent. 9321 len. 19]: Would you believe it -- the worthless girl vows she will never leave her mother 's house ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9322 len. 12]: `` Ah , mother , YOU never heard her say so !
Parsing [sent. 9323 len. 7]: I know Mercy better than that !
Parsing [sent. 9324 len. 9]: She will leave it when I say COME .
Parsing [sent. 9325 len. 7]: But that wo n't be now .
Parsing [sent. 9326 len. 16]: I must wait , and come and fetch her when she is of age . ''
Parsing [sent. 9327 len. 9]: `` She is not worthy of you . ''
Parsing [sent. 9328 len. 13]: `` She is worthy of me if I were twenty times worthier !
Parsing [sent. 9329 len. 4]: Mother , mother !
Parsing [sent. 9330 len. 8]: What has turned you against us again ?
Parsing [sent. 9331 len. 10]: It is not like you to change about so !
Parsing [sent. 9332 len. 9]: I can not bear to find you changeable !
Parsing [sent. 9333 len. 14]: I should have sworn you were just the one to understand her perfectly !
Parsing [sent. 9334 len. 14]: I can not bear you should let unworthy reasons prejudice you against anyone !
Parsing [sent. 9335 len. 20]: -- If you say a word more against her , I will go and sit outside with the moon .
Parsing [sent. 9336 len. 35]: She is not up yet , but she will be presently -- and though she is rather old and silly , I shall find her much better company than you , mother dear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9337 len. 9]: He spoke playfully , but was grievously puzzled .
Parsing [sent. 9338 len. 9]: `` To whom are you talking , Alister ?
Parsing [sent. 9339 len. 7]: -- yourself or a ghost ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9340 len. 19]: Alister started up , and saw his mother coming from the bedroom with a candle in her hand !
Parsing [sent. 9341 len. 4]: He stood stupefied .
Parsing [sent. 9342 len. 14]: He looked again at the seated figure , still bending over the fire .
Parsing [sent. 9343 len. 8]: Who was it if not his mother ?
Parsing [sent. 9344 len. 22]: With a wild burst of almost hysteric laughter , Mercy sprang to her feet , and threw herself in his arms .
Parsing [sent. 9345 len. 19]: It was not the less a new bewilderment that it was an unspeakably delightful change from the last .
Parsing [sent. 9346 len. 6]: Was he awake or dreaming ?
Parsing [sent. 9347 len. 9]: Was the dream of his boyhood come true ?
Parsing [sent. 9348 len. 9]: or was he dreaming it on in manhood ?
Parsing [sent. 9349 len. 5]: It was come true !
Parsing [sent. 9350 len. 5]: The princess was arrived !
Parsing [sent. 9351 len. 11]: She was here in his cave to be his own !
Parsing [sent. 9352 len. 13]: A great calm and a boundless hope filled the heart of Alister .
Parsing [sent. 9353 len. 13]: The night was far advanced when he left them to go home .
Parsing [sent. 9354 len. 34]: Nor did he find his way home , but wandered all night about the tomb , making long rounds and still returning like an angel sent to hover and watch until the morning .
Parsing [sent. 9355 len. 48]: When he astonished them by entering as they sat at breakfast , and told them how he had passed the night , it thrilled Mercy 's heart to know that , while she slept and was dreaming about him , he was awake and thinking about her .
Parsing [sent. 9356 len. 16]: `` What is only dreaming in me , is thinking in you , Alister ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9357 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 9358 len. 64]: `` I was thinking , '' returned Alister , `` that as you did not know I was watching you , so , when we feel as if God were nowhere , he is watching over us with an eternal consciousness , above and beyond our every hope and fear , untouched by the varying faith and fluctuating moods of his children . ''
Parsing [sent. 9359 len. 33]: After breakfast he went to see the clergyman of the parish , who lived some miles away ; the result of which visit was that in a few days they were married .
Parsing [sent. 9360 len. 28]: First , however , he went once more to the New House , desiring to tell Mr. Palmer what had been and was about to be done .
Parsing [sent. 9361 len. 19]: He refused to see him , and would not allow his wife or Christina to go to him .
Parsing [sent. 9362 len. 15]: The wedding was solemnized at noon within the ruined walls of the old castle .
Parsing [sent. 9363 len. 29]: The withered remnant of the clan , with pipes playing , guns firing , and shouts of celebration , marched to the cave-house to fetch thence the bride .
Parsing [sent. 9364 len. 21]: When the ceremony was over , a feast was ready for all in the barn , and much dancing followed .
Parsing [sent. 9365 len. 143]: When evening came , with a half-moon hanging faint in the limpid blue , and the stars looking large through the mist of ungathered tears -- those of nature , not the lovers ; with a wind like the breath of a sleeping child , sweet and soft , and full of dreams of summer ; the mountains and hills asleep around them like a flock of day - wearied things , and haunted by the angels of Rob 's visions -- the lovers , taking leave only of the mother , stole away to walk through the heavenly sapphire of the still night , up the hills and over the rushing streams of the spring , to the cave of their rest -- no ill omen but lovely symbol to such as could see in the tomb the porch of paradise .
Parsing [sent. 9366 len. 14]: Where should true lovers make their bed but on the threshold of eternity !
Parsing [sent. 9367 len. 5]: CHAPTER XXI THE FAREWELL .

Parsing [sent. 9371 len. 8]: The chief arranged them in marching column .
Parsing [sent. 9372 len. 44]: Foremost went the pipes ; the chief , his wife , and his mother , came next ; Hector of the Stags , carrying the double-barrelled rifle the chief had given him , Rob of the Angels , and Donal shoemaker , followed .
Parsing [sent. 9373 len. 35]: Then came the women and children ; next , the carts , with a few , who could not walk , on the top of the baggage ; the men brought up the rear .

Parsing [sent. 9377 len. 38]: Mr. Peregrine Palmer kept his room , but Mrs. Palmer bade her daughter a loving farewell -- more relieved than she cared to show , that the cause of so much discomfort was going so far away .
Parsing [sent. 9378 len. 4]: The children wept .
Parsing [sent. 9379 len. 25]: Christina bade her sister good-bye with a hopeless , almost envious look : Mercy , who did not love him , would see Ian !

Parsing [sent. 9381 len. 35]: Kissing Mercy once more , she choked down a sob , and whispered , `` Give my love -- no , my heart , to Ian , and tell him I AM trying . ''

Parsing [sent. 9383 len. 10]: The pipes struck up ; the column moved on .
Parsing [sent. 9384 len. 37]: When they came to the corner which would hide from them their native strath , the march changed to a lament , and with the opening wail , all stopped and turned for a farewell look .
Parsing [sent. 9385 len. 32]: Men and women , the chief alone excepted , burst into weeping , and the sound of their lamentation went wandering through the hills with an adieu to every loved spot .
Parsing [sent. 9386 len. 21]: And this was what the pipes said : We shall never see you more , Never more , never more !
Parsing [sent. 9387 len. 41]: Till the sea be dry , and the world be bare , And the dews have ceased to fall , And the rivers have ceased to run , We shall never see you more , Never more , never more !
Parsing [sent. 9388 len. 19]: They stood and gazed , and the pipes went on lamenting , and the women went on weeping .
