Parsing [sent. 1 len. 13]: The Love Affairs of Pixie , by Mrs George de Horne Vaizey .
Parsing [sent. 2 len. 40]: Here we have yet again the lovable Pixie , the youngest child of the O'Shaughnessy family , who had all been brought up at Knock Castle , in Ireland , and about whom two previous books have been written .
Parsing [sent. 3 len. 39]: None of the family can quite get their minds round the fact that Pixie is now old enough to have affairs , and even to marry , especially as they are all aware how very plain she is .
Parsing [sent. 4 len. 6]: But Pixie has other ideas .
Parsing [sent. 5 len. 24]: She becomes engaged to Stanor Vaughan , a very good-looking young rising businessman , whose very rich but disabled uncle is his guardian .
Parsing [sent. 6 len. 22]: The uncle suggests that Stanor should go to America for a couple of years , to become a bit more mature .
Parsing [sent. 7 len. 21]: Meanwhile there is very nasty and sudden accident to little Jack , an angelic little boy , whom everybody adores .
Parsing [sent. 8 len. 4]: Will he survive ?
Parsing [sent. 9 len. 6]: Eventually Stanor returns to London .
Parsing [sent. 10 len. 19]: But things have sorted themselves out rather better than we would have thought after the first few chapters .
Parsing [sent. 11 len. 13]: This book was printed in a very heavy type on thinnish paper .
Parsing [sent. 12 len. 25]: It was a mistake to scan it on the default brightness setting , and it was very difficult to clean out all the misreads .
Parsing [sent. 13 len. 14]: There may yet be a few , but not many , I hope .
Parsing [sent. 14 len. 10]: These will be taken out eventually , I hope .
Parsing [sent. 15 len. 13]: THE LOVE AFFAIRS OF PIXIE , BY MRS GEORGE DE HORNE VAIZEY .
Parsing [sent. 16 len. 3]: CHAPTER ONE .
Parsing [sent. 17 len. 5]: THE QUESTION OF NOSES .
Parsing [sent. 18 len. 26]: When Pixie O'Shaughnessy had reached her twentieth birthday it was borne in upon her with the nature of a shock that she was not beautiful .
Parsing [sent. 19 len. 43]: Hitherto a buoyant and innocent self-satisfaction , coupled with the atmosphere of love and admiration by which she was surrounded in the family circle , had succeeded in blinding her eyes to the very obvious defects of feature which the mirror portrayed .
Parsing [sent. 20 len. 10]: But suddenly , sharply , her eyes were opened .
Parsing [sent. 21 len. 22]: `` Did it ever occur to you , Bridgie , my dear , that I 've grown-up _ plain _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 22 len. 55]: she demanded of her sister , Mrs Victor , as the two sat by the fire one winter afternoon , partaking luxuriously of strong tea and potato cakes , and at the sound of such a surprising question Mrs Victor started as if a crack of thunder had suddenly pealed through the quiet room .
Parsing [sent. 23 len. 13]: She stared in amazement ; her big , grey eyes widened dramatically .
Parsing [sent. 24 len. 24]: `` My good child , '' she demanded sternly , `` whatever made you think of asking such a preposterous question ? '' ''
Parsing [sent. 25 len. 8]: 'T was borne in on me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 26 len. 4]: sighed Pixie sadly .
Parsing [sent. 27 len. 33]: `` It 's the way with life ; ye go jog-trotting along , blind and cheerful , until suddenly ye bang your head against a wall , and your eyes are opened !
Parsing [sent. 28 len. 7]: 'T was the same with me .
Parsing [sent. 29 len. 12]: I looked at myself every day , but I never saw .
Parsing [sent. 30 len. 30]: Habit , my dear , blindfolded me like a bandage , and looking at good-looking people all day long it seemed only natural that I should look nice too .
Parsing [sent. 31 len. 31]: But this morning the sun shone , and I stood before the glass twisting about to try on my new hat , and , Bridgie , the truth was revealed !
Parsing [sent. 32 len. 6]: _ My nose _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 33 len. 10]: `` What 's the matter with your nose ? ''
Parsing [sent. 34 len. 4]: demanded Mrs Victor .
Parsing [sent. 35 len. 31]: Her own sweet , delicately cut face was flushed with anger , and she sat with stiffened back staring across the fireplace as if demanding compensation for a personal injury .
Parsing [sent. 36 len. 13]: Pixie sighed , and helped herself to another slice of potato cake .
Parsing [sent. 37 len. 5]: `` It scoops ! ''
Parsing [sent. 38 len. 4]: she said plaintively .
Parsing [sent. 39 len. 15]: `` As you love me , Bridgie , can you deny it scoops ? ''
Parsing [sent. 40 len. 27]: And as if to illustrate the truth of her words she twisted her head so as to present her little profile for her sister 's inspection .
Parsing [sent. 41 len. 8]: Truly it was not a classic outline !
Parsing [sent. 42 len. 64]: Sketched in bare outline it would have lacerated an artist 's eye , but then more things than line go to the making up a girlish face : there is youth , for instance , and a blooming complexion ; there is vivacity , and sweetness , and an intangible something which for want of a better name we call `` charm . ''
Parsing [sent. 43 len. 27]: Mrs Victor beheld all these attributes in her sister 's face , and her eyes softened as they looked , but her voice was still resentful .
Parsing [sent. 44 len. 6]: `` Of course it scoops .
Parsing [sent. 45 len. 7]: It always _ did _ scoop .
Parsing [sent. 46 len. 7]: I like it to scoop . ''
Parsing [sent. 47 len. 7]: `` I like them straight ! ''
Parsing [sent. 48 len. 3]: persisted Pixie .
Parsing [sent. 49 len. 13]: `` And it is n't as if it stopped at the nose .
Parsing [sent. 50 len. 16]: There 's my mouth -- '' Bridgie 's laugh had a tender , reminiscent ring .
Parsing [sent. 51 len. 7]: `` The Mammoth Cave of Kentucky !
Parsing [sent. 52 len. 8]: D'you remember the Major 's old name ?
Parsing [sent. 53 len. 9]: He was _ proud _ of your mouth .
Parsing [sent. 54 len. 9]: And you had no chin as a child .
Parsing [sent. 55 len. 17]: You ought to be thankful , Pixie , that you 've grown to a chin ! ''
Parsing [sent. 56 len. 10]: `` I am , '' cried Pixie with unction .
Parsing [sent. 57 len. 12]: `` It would be awful to slope down into your neck .
Parsing [sent. 58 len. 32]: All the same , me dear , if it was my eyes that were bigger , and my mouth that was smaller , it would be better for all concerned . ''
Parsing [sent. 59 len. 13]: She was silent for some moments , staring thoughtfully in the fire .
Parsing [sent. 60 len. 35]: From time to time she frowned , and from time to time she smiled ; Bridgie divined that a thought was working , and lay back in her seat , amusedly watching its development .
Parsing [sent. 61 len. 27]: `` There 's a place in Paris , '' continued Pixie thoughtfully at last , `` an institute sort of place , where they repair noses !
Parsing [sent. 62 len. 27]: You sort of go in , and they look at you , and there are models and drawings , and _ you choose your nose _ !
Parsing [sent. 63 len. 24]: The manager is an expert , and if you choose a wrong style he advises , and says another would suit you better .
Parsing [sent. 64 len. 43]: I 'd love a Greek one myself ; it 's so _ chic _ to float down straight from the forehead , but I expect he 'd advise a blend that would n't look too _ epatant _ with my other features .
Parsing [sent. 65 len. 12]: -- It takes a fortnight , and it does n't hurt .
Parsing [sent. 66 len. 15]: Your nose is gelatine , not bone ; and it costs fifty pounds . ''
Parsing [sent. 67 len. 5]: `` Wicked waste ! ''
Parsing [sent. 68 len. 18]: cried Mrs Victor , with all the fervour of a matron whose own nose is beyond reproach .
Parsing [sent. 69 len. 7]: `` Fifty pounds on a nose !
Parsing [sent. 70 len. 9]: I never heard of such foolish extravagance . ''
Parsing [sent. 71 len. 9]: `` Esmeralda paid eighty for a sealskin coat .
Parsing [sent. 72 len. 21]: A nose would last for life , while if a single moth got inside the brown paper -- whew ! ''
Parsing [sent. 73 len. 32]: Pixie waved her hands with the Frenchiness of gesture which was the outcome of an education abroad , and which made an amusing contrast with an Irish accent , unusually pronounced .
Parsing [sent. 74 len. 23]: `` I 'd think nothing of running over to Paris for a fortnight 's jaunt , and having the nose thrown in .
Parsing [sent. 75 len. 43]: Fancy me walking in on you all , before you 'd well realised I was away , smart and smiling with a profile like Clytie , or a sweet little acquiline , or a neat and wavey one , like your own .
Parsing [sent. 76 len. 7]: You would n't know me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 77 len. 6]: `` I should n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 78 len. 4]: said Bridgie eloquently .
Parsing [sent. 79 len. 7]: `` Now let 's pretend ! ''
Parsing [sent. 80 len. 24]: Pixie hitched her chair nearer to the fire , and placed her little feet on the fender with an air of intense enjoyment .
Parsing [sent. 81 len. 27]: In truth , tea-time , and the opportunity which it gave of undisturbed parleys with Bridgie , ranked as one of the great occasions of life .
Parsing [sent. 82 len. 43]: Every day there seemed something fresh and exciting to discuss , and the game of `` pretend '' made unfailing appeal to the happy Irish natures , but it was not often that such an original and thrilling topic came under discussion .
Parsing [sent. 83 len. 4]: A repaired nose !
Parsing [sent. 84 len. 15]: Pixie warmed to the theme with the zest of a skilled _ raconteur _ .
Parsing [sent. 85 len. 30]: ... `` You 'd be sitting here , and I 'd walk in in my hat and veil -- a new-fashioned scriggley veil , as a sort of screen .
Parsing [sent. 86 len. 4]: We 'd kiss .
Parsing [sent. 87 len. 55]: If it was a long kiss , you 'd feel the point , being accustomed to a button , and that would give it away , but I 'd make it short so you 'd notice nothing , and I 'd sit down with my back to the light , and we 'd talk .
Parsing [sent. 88 len. 11]: ` Take off your hat , ' you 'd say .
Parsing [sent. 89 len. 10]: ` In a moment , ' I 'd answer .
Parsing [sent. 90 len. 13]: ` Not yet , me dear , my hair 's untidy . '
Parsing [sent. 91 len. 20]: ` You look like a visitor , ' you 'd say , ` with your veil drawn down . '
Parsing [sent. 92 len. 12]: ` It 's a French one , ' I 'd say .
Parsing [sent. 93 len. 9]: ` It becomes me , does n't it ?
Parsing [sent. 94 len. 22]: Three francs fifty , ' and you 'd frown , and stare , and say , ` _ Does _ it ?
Parsing [sent. 95 len. 5]: I do n't know !
Parsing [sent. 96 len. 7]: You look -- different , Pixie .
Parsing [sent. 97 len. 9]: You do n't look -- yourself ! ' ''
Parsing [sent. 98 len. 14]: The real Pixie gurgled with enjoyment , and Bridgie Victor gurgled in response .
Parsing [sent. 99 len. 62]: `` Then I 'd protest , and ask what was the matter , and say if there _ was _ anything , it must be the veil , and if there _ was _ a change was n't it honestly for the better , and I 'd push up my veil and smile at you ; smile languidly across the room .
Parsing [sent. 100 len. 9]: I can see your face , poor darling !
Parsing [sent. 101 len. 30]: All scared and starey , while I turned round s-lowly , s-lowly , until I was sideways towards you , with me elegant Grecian nose ... '' Bridgie shuddered .
Parsing [sent. 102 len. 8]: `` I 'd not live through it !
Parsing [sent. 103 len. 6]: It would break my heart .
Parsing [sent. 104 len. 17]: With a Grecian nose you might be Patricia , but you could n't possibly be Pixie .
Parsing [sent. 105 len. 9]: It 's too horrible to think of ! ''
Parsing [sent. 106 len. 30]: But Pixie had in her nature a reserve of obstinacy , and in absolutely good-natured fashion could `` hang on '' to a point through any amount of discouragement .
Parsing [sent. 107 len. 21]: `` Now , since you mention it , that 's another argument in my favour , '' she said quickly .
Parsing [sent. 108 len. 23]: `` It 's hard on a girl of twenty to be bereft of her legal name because of incompatibility with her features .
Parsing [sent. 109 len. 18]: Now , with a Grecian nose -- '' Bridgie sat up suddenly , and cleared her throat .
Parsing [sent. 110 len. 23]: The time had come to remember her own position as married sister and guardian , and put a stop to frivolous imaginings .
Parsing [sent. 111 len. 24]: `` May I ask , '' she demanded clearly , `` exactly in what manner you would propose to raise the fifty pounds ?
Parsing [sent. 112 len. 32]: Your nose is your own to do what you like with -- or will be at the end of another year -- but -- '' `` The fifty pounds is n't !
Parsing [sent. 113 len. 8]: I know it , '' said Pixie .
Parsing [sent. 114 len. 42]: She did not sigh , as would have seemed appropriate at such a moment , but exhibited rather a cheerful and gratified air , as though her own poverty were an amusing peculiarity which added to the list of her attractions .
Parsing [sent. 115 len. 28]: `` Of course , my dear , nobody ever dreamt for a moment it could be _ done _ , but it 's always interesting to pretend .
Parsing [sent. 116 len. 27]: Do n't we amuse ourselves for hours pretending to be millionaires , when you 're all of a flutter about eighteen-pence extra in the laundry bill ?
Parsing [sent. 117 len. 15]: I wonder at _ you _ , Bridgie , pretending to be practical . ''
Parsing [sent. 118 len. 10]: `` I 'm sorry , '' said Bridgie humbly .
Parsing [sent. 119 len. 27]: A pang of conscience pierced her heart , for had it not been her own extravagance which had swelled the laundry bill by that terrible eighteen-pence ?
Parsing [sent. 120 len. 20]: Penitence engendered a more tender spirit , and she said gently -- `` We love your looks , Pixie .
Parsing [sent. 121 len. 9]: To us you seem lovely and beautiful . ''
Parsing [sent. 122 len. 6]: `` Bless your blind eyes !
Parsing [sent. 123 len. 5]: I know I do .
Parsing [sent. 124 len. 17]: But , '' added Pixie astonishingly , `` I was n't thinking of you ! '' ''
Parsing [sent. 125 len. 5]: _ Not _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 126 len. 56]: A moment followed of sheer , gaping surprise , for Bridgie Victor was so accustomed to the devotion of her young sister , so placidly , assured that the quiet family life furnished the girl with , everything necessary for her happiness , that the suggestion of an outside interest came as a shock . ''
Parsing [sent. 127 len. 5]: _ Not _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 128 len. 4]: she repeated blankly .
Parsing [sent. 129 len. 8]: `` Then -- then -- who ? ''
Parsing [sent. 130 len. 5]: `` My lovers ! ''
Parsing [sent. 131 len. 4]: replied Pixie calmly .
Parsing [sent. 132 len. 34]: ------------------------------------------------------------------------ And looking back through the years , it always seemed to Bridgie Victor that with the utterance of those words the life of Pixie O'Shaughnessy entered upon a new and absorbing phase .
Parsing [sent. 133 len. 3]: CHAPTER TWO .
Parsing [sent. 134 len. 6]: PIXIE 'S VIEWS ON MARRIAGE .
Parsing [sent. 135 len. 12]: Bridgie Victor sat gazing at her sister in a numb bewilderment .
Parsing [sent. 136 len. 38]: It was the first , the very first time that the girl had breathed a word concerning the romantic possibilities of her own life , and even Bridgie 's trained imagination failed to rise to the occasion .
Parsing [sent. 137 len. 2]: Pixie !
Parsing [sent. 138 len. 2]: Lovers !
Parsing [sent. 139 len. 2]: Lovers !
Parsing [sent. 140 len. 2]: Pixie !
Parsing [sent. 141 len. 12]: ... The juxtaposition of ideas was too preposterous to be grasped .
Parsing [sent. 142 len. 50]: Pixie was a child , the baby of the family , just a bigger , more entertaining baby to play with the tinies of the second generation , who treated her as one of themselves , and one and all scorned to bestow the title of `` aunt . ''
Parsing [sent. 143 len. 88]: There was a young Patricia in the nursery at Knock Castle , and a second edition in the Victor nursery upstairs ; but though the baptismal name of the little sister had been copied , not even the adoring mothers themselves would have dreamed of borrowing the beloved pet name , Pixie 's nose might not be to her approval ; it might even scoop -- to be perfectly candid , it _ did _ scoop -- but it had never yet been put out of joint .
Parsing [sent. 144 len. 30]: The one and only , the inimitable Pixie , she still lived enthroned in the hearts of her brothers and sisters , as something specially and peculiarly their own .
Parsing [sent. 145 len. 60]: So it was that a pang rent Bridgie 's heart at the realisation that the little sister was grown-up , was actually twenty years of age -- past twenty , going to be twenty-one in a few more months , and that the time was approaching when a stranger might have the audacity to steal her from the fold .
Parsing [sent. 146 len. 31]: To her own heart , Bridgie realised the likelihood of such a theft , and the naturalness thereof : outwardly , for Pixie 's benefit she appeared shocked to death .
Parsing [sent. 147 len. 4]: `` L-lovers ! ''
Parsing [sent. 148 len. 3]: gasped Bridgie .
Parsing [sent. 149 len. 3]: `` Lovers !
Parsing [sent. 150 len. 14]: Is it you , Pixie O'Shaughnessy , I hear talking of such things ?
Parsing [sent. 151 len. 8]: I 'm surprised ; I 'm shocked !
Parsing [sent. 152 len. 14]: I never could have believed you troubled your head about such matters . ''
Parsing [sent. 153 len. 10]: `` But I do , '' asserted Pixie cheerfully .
Parsing [sent. 154 len. 3]: `` Lots .
Parsing [sent. 155 len. 15]: Not to say _ trouble _ , exactly , for it 's most agreeable .
Parsing [sent. 156 len. 13]: I pretend about them , and decide what they 'll be like .
Parsing [sent. 157 len. 17]: When I see a man that takes my fancy , I add him to the list .
Parsing [sent. 158 len. 30]: Mostly they 're clean-shaved , but I saw one the other day with a beard -- '' She lifted a warning finger to stay Bridgie 's cry of protest .
Parsing [sent. 159 len. 24]: `` Not a straggler , but a naval one , short and trim ; and you would n't believe how becoming it was !
Parsing [sent. 160 len. 10]: I decided then to have one with a beard .
Parsing [sent. 161 len. 25]: And they are mostly tall and handsome , and rolling in riches , so that I can buy anything I like , nose included .
Parsing [sent. 162 len. 29]: But one must be poor and sad , because that , '' announced Pixie , in her most radiant fashion , `` would be good for my character .
Parsing [sent. 163 len. 10]: I 'd be sorry for him , the creature !
Parsing [sent. 164 len. 13]: And , as they say in books , ` twould soften me .
Parsing [sent. 165 len. 20]: Would you say honestly , now , Bridgie , that I 'm in _ need _ of softening ? ''
Parsing [sent. 166 len. 5]: `` I should not .
Parsing [sent. 167 len. 9]: I should say you were soft enough already .
Parsing [sent. 168 len. 6]: _ Too _ soft ! ''
Parsing [sent. 169 len. 5]: declared Bridgie sternly . ''
Parsing [sent. 170 len. 6]: ` Them , ' indeed !
Parsing [sent. 171 len. 7]: Plural , I 'll trouble you !
Parsing [sent. 172 len. 31]: Just realise , my child , that there are not enough men to go round , and do n't waste time making pictures of a chorus who will never appear .
Parsing [sent. 173 len. 27]: If you have _ one _ lover , it will be more than your share ; and it 's doubtful if you ever get that . ''
Parsing [sent. 174 len. 10]: `` I doubt it , '' maintained Pixie sturdily .
Parsing [sent. 175 len. 11]: `` I 'm plain , but I 've a way .
Parsing [sent. 176 len. 12]: You know yourself , me dear , I 've a way !
Parsing [sent. 177 len. 33]: ... I 'm afraid I 'll have lots ; and that 's the trouble of it , for as sure as you 're there , Bridgie , I 'll accept them all !
Parsing [sent. 178 len. 25]: ` Twould n't be in my heart to say no , with a nice man begging to be allowed to take care of me .
Parsing [sent. 179 len. 41]: I 'd love him on the spot for being so kind ; or if I did n't , and I saw him upset , it would seem only decent to comfort him , so ` twould end the same way .
Parsing [sent. 180 len. 51]: ... It breaks my heart when the girls refuse the nice man in books , and I always long to be able to run after him when he leaves the room -- ashy pale , with a nerve twitching beside his eye -- and ask him will I do instead !
Parsing [sent. 181 len. 20]: If I feel like that to another girl 's lover , what will I do to my own ? ''
Parsing [sent. 182 len. 4]: Bridgie stared aghast .
Parsing [sent. 183 len. 29]: Her brain was still reeling from the shock of hearing Pixie refer to the subject of lovers at all , and here was yet another problem looming ahead .
Parsing [sent. 184 len. 26]: With a loving grasp of her sister 's character , she realised that the protestations to which she had just listened embodied a real danger .
Parsing [sent. 185 len. 26]: Pixie had always been `` the soft-heartedest creature , '' who had never from her earliest years been known to refuse a plea for help .
Parsing [sent. 186 len. 25]: It would only be in keeping with her character if she accepted a suitor out of pure politeness and unwillingness to hurt his feelings .
Parsing [sent. 187 len. 52]: Bridgie was a happy wife , and for that very reason was determined that if care and guidance , if authority , and persuasion , and precept , and a judicious amount of influence could do it , Pixie should never be married , unless it were to the right man .
Parsing [sent. 188 len. 28]: She therefore adopted her elderly attitude once more , and said firmly -- `` It 's very wicked and misguided even to talk in such a way .
Parsing [sent. 189 len. 63]: When the time comes that a man asks you to marry him -- if it ever comes -- it will be your first and foremost duty to examine your own heart and see if you love him enough to live with him all his life , whether he is ill or well , or rich or poor , or happy or sad .
Parsing [sent. 190 len. 79]: You will have to decide whether you would be happier with him in trouble or free by yourself , and you 'd have to remember that it 's not always too easy managing a house , and -- and walking about half the night with a teething baby , and darning socks , when you want to go out , and wearing the same dress three years running , even if you love the man you 've married .
Parsing [sent. 191 len. 17]: Of course , some girls marry rich husbands -- like Esmeralda ; but that 's rare .
Parsing [sent. 192 len. 30]: Far more young couples begin as we did , with having to be careful about every shilling ; and that , my dear , is _ not _ agreeable !
Parsing [sent. 193 len. 25]: You need to be _ very _ fond of a man to make it worth while to go on short commons all your life .
Parsing [sent. 194 len. 18]: You need to think things over very carefully , before you accept an offer of marriage . ''
Parsing [sent. 195 len. 21]: Pixie sat listening , her head cocked to one side , with the air of a bright , intelligent bird .
Parsing [sent. 196 len. 19]: When Bridgie had finished speaking she sighed and knitted her brows , and stared thoughtfully into the fire .
Parsing [sent. 197 len. 27]: It was obvious that she was pondering over what had been said , and did not find herself altogether in agreement with the rules laid down .
Parsing [sent. 198 len. 35]: `` You mean , '' she said slowly , `` that I should have to think altogether of _ myself _ and what would suit _ Me _ and make _ me _ happy ?
Parsing [sent. 199 len. 11]: That 's strange , now ; that 's very strange !
Parsing [sent. 200 len. 51]: To bring a girl up all her life to believe it 's her duty in every small thing that comes along to put herself last and her family in front , and then when she 's a grown-up woman , and a man comes along who believes , poor thing !
Parsing [sent. 201 len. 29]: that she could help him and make him happy , _ then _ just at that moment you tell her to be selfish and think only of herself .
Parsing [sent. 202 len. 14]: ... 'T is not that way I 'll conduct my love affairs ! ''
Parsing [sent. 203 len. 4]: cried Pixie O'Shaughnessy .
Parsing [sent. 204 len. 10]: Her eyes met Bridgie 's , and flashed defiance .
Parsing [sent. 205 len. 22]: `` When I meet a man who needs me I 'll find my own happiness in helping _ him _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 206 len. 7]: `` Bless you , darling ! ''
Parsing [sent. 207 len. 4]: said Bridgie softly .
Parsing [sent. 208 len. 8]: `` I am quite sure you will .
Parsing [sent. 209 len. 22]: ... It 's a very , very serious time for a woman when the question of marriage comes into her life .
Parsing [sent. 210 len. 10]: You ca n't treat it _ too _ seriously .
Parsing [sent. 211 len. 26]: I have not thought of it so far in connection with you , but now that I do I 'll pray about it , Pixie !
Parsing [sent. 212 len. 16]: I 'll pray for you , that you may be guided to a right choice .
Parsing [sent. 213 len. 14]: You 'll pray that for yourself , wo n't you , dear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 214 len. 9]: `` I will , '' said Pixie quietly .
Parsing [sent. 215 len. 4]: `` I do .
Parsing [sent. 216 len. 10]: And for him -- the man I may marry .
Parsing [sent. 217 len. 11]: I 've prayed for him quite a long time . ''
Parsing [sent. 218 len. 9]: `` The ... the _ man _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 219 len. 10]: Bridgie was so surprised as to appear almost shocked .
Parsing [sent. 220 len. 11]: `` My dear , you do n't know him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 221 len. 10]: `` But he is alive , is n't he ?
Parsing [sent. 222 len. 12]: He must be , if I 'm going to marry him .
Parsing [sent. 223 len. 15]: Alive , and grown-up , and living , perhaps , not so far away .
Parsing [sent. 224 len. 29]: Perhaps he 's an orphan , Bridgie ; or if he has a home , perhaps he 's had to leave it and live in a strange town .
Parsing [sent. 225 len. 18]: ... Perhaps he 's in lodgings , going home every night to sit alone in a room .
Parsing [sent. 226 len. 14]: Perhaps he 's trying to be good , and finding it very hard .
Parsing [sent. 227 len. 17]: Perhaps there 's no one in all the world to pray for him but just me .
Parsing [sent. 228 len. 4]: _ Bridgie _ !
Parsing [sent. 229 len. 16]: If I 'm going to love him how can I _ not _ pray ? ''
Parsing [sent. 230 len. 18]: Mrs Victor rose hurriedly from her seat , and busied herself with the arrangement of the curtains .
Parsing [sent. 231 len. 29]: They were heavy velvet curtains , which at night-time drew round the whole of the large bay window which formed the end of the pretty , cosy room .
Parsing [sent. 232 len. 29]: Bridgie took especial pleasure in the effect of a great brass vase which , on its oaken pedestal , stood sharply outlined against the rich , dark folds .
Parsing [sent. 233 len. 29]: She moved its position now , moved it back into its original place , and touched the leaves of the chrysanthemum which stood therein with a caressing hand .
Parsing [sent. 234 len. 25]: Six years ' residence in a town had not sufficed to teach the one-time mistress of Knock Castle to be economical when purchasing flowers .
Parsing [sent. 235 len. 8]: `` I ca n't live without them .
Parsing [sent. 236 len. 11]: It 's not my fault if they are dear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 237 len. 16]: she would protest to her own conscience at the sight of the florist 's bill .
Parsing [sent. 238 len. 32]: And in truth , who could expect a girl to be content with a few scant blossoms when she had lived all her early age in the midst of prodigal plenty !
Parsing [sent. 239 len. 10]: In spring the fields had been white with snowdrops .
Parsing [sent. 240 len. 38]: Sylvia sent over small packing-cases every February , filled with hundreds and hundreds of little tight bunches of the spotless white flowers , and almost every woman of Bridgie 's acquaintance rejoiced with her on their arrival .
Parsing [sent. 241 len. 13]: After the snowdrops came on the wild daffodils and bluebells and primroses .
Parsing [sent. 242 len. 32]: They arrived in cases also , fragrant with the scent which was really no scent at all , but just the incarnation of everything fresh , and pure , and rural .
Parsing [sent. 243 len. 7]: Then came the blossoming of trees .
Parsing [sent. 244 len. 36]: Bridgie sighed whenever she thought of blossom , for that was one thing which would _ not _ pack ; and the want of greenery too , that was another cross to the city dweller .
Parsing [sent. 245 len. 40]: She longed to break off great branches of trees , and place them in corners of the room ; she longed to wander into the fields and pick handfuls of grasses , and honeysuckle , and prickly briar sprays .
Parsing [sent. 246 len. 14]: Who could blame her for taking advantage of what compensation lay within reach ?
Parsing [sent. 247 len. 23]: This afternoon , however , the contemplation of the tawny chrysanthemums displayed in the brass vase failed to inspire the usual joy .
Parsing [sent. 248 len. 26]: Bridgie 's eyes were bright indeed as she turned back into the room , but it was the sort of brightness which betokens tears repressed .
Parsing [sent. 249 len. 47]: She laid her hand on the little sister 's shoulders , and spoke in the deepest tone of her tender Irish voice -- `` What has been happening to you , my Pixie , all this time when I 've been treating you as a child ?
Parsing [sent. 250 len. 12]: Have you been growing up quietly into a little woman ? ''
Parsing [sent. 251 len. 13]: Pixie smiled up into her face -- a bright , unclouded smile .
Parsing [sent. 252 len. 13]: `` Faith , '' she said , radiantly , `` I believe .
Parsing [sent. 253 len. 4]: I have ! ''
Parsing [sent. 254 len. 3]: CHAPTER THREE .
Parsing [sent. 255 len. 3]: NEARLY TWENTY-ONE !
Parsing [sent. 256 len. 25]: Bridgie rang the bell to have the tea-things removed and a message sent to the nursery that the children might descend without further delay .
Parsing [sent. 257 len. 48]: It was still a few minutes before the orthodox hour , but the conversation had reached a point when a distraction would be welcome , and Jack and Patsie were invariably prancing with impatience from the moment when the smell of hot potato cakes ascended from below .
Parsing [sent. 258 len. 32]: They came with a rush , pattering down the staircase with a speed which made Bridgie gasp and groan , and bursting open the door entered the room at the double .
Parsing [sent. 259 len. 26]: Jack was five , and wore a blue tunic with an exceedingly long-waisted belt , beneath which could be discerned the hems of abbreviated knickers .
Parsing [sent. 260 len. 19]: Patricia was three , and wore a limp white frock reaching to the tips of little red shoes .
Parsing [sent. 261 len. 25]: She had long brown locks , and eyes of the true O'Shaughnessy grey , and was proudly supposed to resemble her beautiful aunt Joan .
Parsing [sent. 262 len. 13]: Jack was fair , with linty locks and a jolly brown face .
Parsing [sent. 263 len. 36]: His mouth might have been smaller and still attained a fair average in size , but for the time being his pretty baby teeth filled the cavern so satisfactorily , that no one could complain .
Parsing [sent. 264 len. 33]: Both children made straight for their mother , smothered her with `` Bunnie '' hugs , and then from the shelter of her arms cast quick , questioning glances across the fireplace .
Parsing [sent. 265 len. 30]: There was in their glance a keenness , a curiosity , almost amounting to _ awe _ , which would at once have arrested the attention of an onlooker .
Parsing [sent. 266 len. 59]: It was not in the least the smiling glance of recognition which is accorded to a member of the household on meeting again after one of the short separations of the day ; it resembled far more the half-nervous , half-pleasurable shrinking from an introduction to a stranger , about whom was wrapped a cloak of deepest mystery .
Parsing [sent. 267 len. 26]: As for Pixie herself she sat bolt upright in her seat , staring fixedly into space , and apparently unconscious of the children 's presence .
Parsing [sent. 268 len. 15]: Presently Jack took a tentative step forward , and Patsie followed in his wake .
Parsing [sent. 269 len. 26]: Half a yard from Pixie 's chair they stopped short with eager , craning faces , with bodies braced in readiness for a flying retreat .
Parsing [sent. 270 len. 4]: `` Pixie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 271 len. 3]: No answer .
Parsing [sent. 272 len. 7]: Still the rigid , immovable figure .
Parsing [sent. 273 len. 7]: Still the fixed and staring eye .
Parsing [sent. 274 len. 4]: `` P-ixie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 275 len. 21]: The eyes rolled ; a deep , hollow voice boomed forth -- `` I 'm _ not _ Pixie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 276 len. 5]: The expected had happened .
Parsing [sent. 277 len. 28]: They had known it was coming ; would have been bitterly disappointed if it had failed , nevertheless they writhed and capered as though overcome with amazement .
Parsing [sent. 278 len. 14]: `` P-ixie , Pixie , Who -- Are -- You -- Now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 279 len. 11]: `` I 'm a wild buffalo of the plains ! ''
Parsing [sent. 280 len. 58]: answered Pixie unexpectedly , and as a wild buffalo she comported herself for the next half-hour , ambling on hands and knees round the room , while the children wreathed her neck with impromptu garlands made of wools from their mother 's work-basket , and made votive offerings of sofa cushions , footstools , and india-rubber toys .
Parsing [sent. 281 len. 32]: In the midst of the uproar Bridgie jumped from her seat and flew to the door , her ears sharp as ever to hear the click of her husband 's latch-key .
Parsing [sent. 282 len. 34]: The greeting in the narrow hall was delightfully lover-like for a married couple of six years ' standing , and they entered the drawing-room arm-in-arm , smiling with a contentment charming to witness .
Parsing [sent. 283 len. 24]: Captain Victor was satisfied that no one in the world possessed such an altogether delightful specimen of womanhood as his `` bride . ''
Parsing [sent. 284 len. 51]: She was so sweet , so good , so unselfish , and in addition to these sterling qualities , she was so cheerful , so spontaneous , so unexpected , that it was impossible for life to grow dull and monotonous while she was at the head of the household .
Parsing [sent. 285 len. 34]: He acknowledged tenderly , and with a shrug of the shoulders to express resignation , that she _ might _ have been a cleverer housekeeper and just a thought more economical in expenditure !
Parsing [sent. 286 len. 30]: but considering her happy-go-lucky upbringing under the most thriftless of fathers , the darling really deserved more praise for what she accomplished than blame for what was left undone .
Parsing [sent. 287 len. 18]: Bridgie , on the contrary , considered that Dick worried his head ridiculously about ways and means .
Parsing [sent. 288 len. 38]: Not for the world and all that it contained would she have accused him of being _ mean _ : she merely shrugged _ her _ shoulders and reminded herself that he was English , poor thing !
Parsing [sent. 289 len. 47]: English people had a preference for seeing money visibly in their purses before they spent it , while she herself had been brought up in a cheerful confidence that it would `` turn up '' somehow to pay the bills which had been incurred in faith .
Parsing [sent. 290 len. 32]: Captain Victor displayed not the faintest astonishment at discovering his sister-in-law on all fours , nor did he appear overcome to be introduced to her as a buffalo of the plains .
Parsing [sent. 291 len. 22]: He smiled at her almost as tenderly as at his own babies , and said -- `` How do , Buff !
Parsing [sent. 292 len. 6]: Pleased to have met you .
Parsing [sent. 293 len. 22]: So kind of you to make hay in my drawing-room , '' which reproof brought Pixie quickly to her rightful position .
Parsing [sent. 294 len. 28]: That was another English characteristic of Dick Victor -- he hated disorder , and was not appreciative of uproar on his return from a day 's work .
Parsing [sent. 295 len. 47]: Therefore there were picture-books in waiting for his return , and after a few minutes parleying Pixie cajoled the children into the dining-room on the plea of a bigger and more convenient table for the display of their treasures , leaving the husband and wife alone .
Parsing [sent. 296 len. 18]: Dick lay back in his easy chair , and stretched himself with an involuntary sigh of relief .
Parsing [sent. 297 len. 36]: He was devoted to his children , but a quiet chat with Bridgie was the treat _ par excellence _ at this hour of the day when he was tired and in need of rest .
Parsing [sent. 298 len. 16]: He stretched out a hand towards her , and she stroked it with gentle fingers .
Parsing [sent. 299 len. 7]: `` Ye 're tired , dear .
Parsing [sent. 300 len. 9]: Will I get you a cup of tea ?
Parsing [sent. 301 len. 9]: It 's not long since it went out .
Parsing [sent. 302 len. 13]: If I poured some hot-water in the pot ... '' Dick shuddered .
Parsing [sent. 303 len. 10]: `` Thank you , ma'am , _ no _ !
Parsing [sent. 304 len. 20]: If I have any , I 'll have it fresh , but I do n't care about it to-day .
Parsing [sent. 305 len. 9]: It 's nice just to rest and talk .
Parsing [sent. 306 len. 7]: Anything happened to you to-day ? ''
Parsing [sent. 307 len. 5]: `` There always does .
Parsing [sent. 308 len. 24]: It 's the most exciting thing in the world to be the mistress of a household , '' said Bridgie , with relish .
Parsing [sent. 309 len. 51]: There were few days when Captain Victor was not treated to a history of accidents and contretemps on his return home , but unlike most husbands he rather anticipated than dreaded the recital , for Bridgie so evidently enjoyed it herself , taking a keen retrospective joy over past discomfitures .
Parsing [sent. 310 len. 38]: The Victor household had its own share of vicissitudes , more than its share perhaps , but through them all there survived a spirit of kindliness and good fellowship which took away more than half the strain .
Parsing [sent. 311 len. 45]: Maidservants arriving in moods of suspicion and antagonism found themselves unconsciously unarmed by the cheery , kindly young mistress , who administered praise more readily than blame , and so far from `` giving herself airs '' treated them with friendly kindliness and consideration .
Parsing [sent. 312 len. 57]: On the very rare occasions when a girl was poor-spirited enough to persist in her antagonism , off she went with a month 's money in her pocket , for the peace of her little home was the greatest treasure in the world to Bridgie Victor , and no hireling could be allowed to disturb it .
Parsing [sent. 313 len. 31]: The service in the little house might not be as mechanically perfect as in some others , the meals might vary in excellence , but that was a secondary affair .
Parsing [sent. 314 len. 21]: `` If a bad temper is a necessary accompaniment of a good cook , then -- give me herbs ! ''
Parsing [sent. 315 len. 17]: she would cry , shrugging her pretty shoulders , and her husband agreed -- with reservations !
Parsing [sent. 316 len. 43]: He was a very happy , a very contented man , and every day of his life he thanked God afresh for his happy home , for his children , for the greatest treasure of all , sweet Bridget , his wife !
Parsing [sent. 317 len. 29]: To-day , however , the disclosure had nothing to do with domestic revolutions , and Bridgie 's tone in making her announcement held an unusual note of tragedy .
Parsing [sent. 318 len. 6]: `` Dick , guess what !
Parsing [sent. 319 len. 5]: You 'll never guess !
Parsing [sent. 320 len. 5]: Pixie 's grown-up ! ''
Parsing [sent. 321 len. 15]: For a moment Captain Victor looked as was expected of him -- utterly bewildered .
Parsing [sent. 322 len. 35]: He lay back in his chair , his handsome face blank and expressionless , the while he stared steadily at his wife , and Bridgie stared back , her distress palpably mingled with complacence .
Parsing [sent. 323 len. 14]: Speak she would not , until Dick had given expression to his surprise .
Parsing [sent. 324 len. 25]: She sat still , therefore , shaking her head in a melancholy mandarin fashion , which had the undesired effect of restoring his complacence .
Parsing [sent. 325 len. 8]: `` My darling , what unnecessary woe !
Parsing [sent. 326 len. 33]: It 's astounding , I grant you ; one never expected such a feat of Pixie ; but the years _ will _ pass -- there 's no holding them , unfortunately .
Parsing [sent. 327 len. 9]: How old is she , by the way ?
Parsing [sent. 328 len. 9]: Seventeen , I suppose -- eighteen ? '' ''
Parsing [sent. 329 len. 8]: _ Twenty _ -- nearly twenty-one ! ''
Parsing [sent. 330 len. 17]: Bridgie 's tone was tragic , and Dick Victor in his turn looked startled and grave .
Parsing [sent. 331 len. 14]: He frowned , bit his lip , and stared thoughtfully across the room .
Parsing [sent. 332 len. 3]: `` Twenty-one ?
Parsing [sent. 333 len. 4]: Is it possible ?
Parsing [sent. 334 len. 4]: Grown-up , indeed !
Parsing [sent. 335 len. 9]: Bridgie , we should have realised this before .
Parsing [sent. 336 len. 17]: We have been so content with things as they were that we 've been selfishly blind .
Parsing [sent. 337 len. 13]: If Pixie is over twenty we have not been treating her fairly .
Parsing [sent. 338 len. 10]: We have treated her too much as a child .
Parsing [sent. 339 len. 13]: We ought to have entertained for her , taken her about . ''
Parsing [sent. 340 len. 15]: Bridgie sighed , and dropped her eyelids to hide the twinkle in her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 341 len. 36]: Like most husbands Dick preferred a quiet domestic evening at the end of a day abroad : like most wives Bridgie would have enjoyed a little diversion at the end of a day at home .
Parsing [sent. 342 len. 57]: Sweetly and silently for nearly half a dozen years she had subdued her preferences to his , feeling it at once her pleasure and her duty to do so , but now , if duty suddenly assumed the guise of a gayer , more sociable life , then most cheerfully would Irish Bridgie accept the change .
Parsing [sent. 343 len. 19]: `` I think , dear , '' she said primly , `` it _ would _ be wise .
Parsing [sent. 344 len. 14]: Esmeralda has said so many a time , but I took no notice .
Parsing [sent. 345 len. 24]: I never did take any notice of Esmeralda , but she was right this time , it appears , and I was wrong .
Parsing [sent. 346 len. 3]: Imagine it !
Parsing [sent. 347 len. 28]: Pixie began bemoaning that she was not pretty , and it was not herself she was grieving for , or you , or _ Me _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 348 len. 21]: -- Bridgie 's voice sounded a crescendo of amazement over that last pronoun -- `` but whom do you suppose ?
Parsing [sent. 349 len. 5]: You 'll never guess !
Parsing [sent. 350 len. 7]: Her future _ lovers _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 351 len. 51]: It was just another instance of the provokingness of man that at this horrible disclosure Dick threw himself back in his chair in a peal of laughter ; he laughed and laughed till the tears stood in his eyes , and Bridgie , despite herself , joined in the chorus .
Parsing [sent. 352 len. 32]: The juxtaposition of Pixie and lovers had proved just as startling to him as to his wife , but while she had been scandalised , he was frankly , whole-heartedly amused .
Parsing [sent. 353 len. 4]: `` Pixie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 354 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 355 len. 6]: `` Pixie with a lover !
Parsing [sent. 356 len. 11]: It would be about as easy to think of Patsie .
Parsing [sent. 357 len. 6]: Dear , quaint little Pixie !
Parsing [sent. 358 len. 9]: Who dares to say she is n't pretty ?
Parsing [sent. 359 len. 22]: Her funny little nose , her big , generous mouth are a hundred times more charming than the ordinary pretty face .
Parsing [sent. 360 len. 35]: I 'll tell you what it is , darling , '' -- he sobered suddenly ; -- `` Pixie 's lover , whoever he may be , will be an uncommonly lucky fellow ! ''
Parsing [sent. 361 len. 46]: Husband and wife sat in silence for some moments after this , hand in hand , as their custom was in hours of privacy , while the thoughts of each pursued the same subject -- Pixie 's opening life and their own duty towards it .
Parsing [sent. 362 len. 45]: On both minds was borne the unwilling realisation that their own home was not the ideal abode to afford the experience of life , the open intercourse with young people of her own age which it was desirable that the girl should now enjoy .
Parsing [sent. 363 len. 40]: As a means of adding to his income Captain Victor had accepted the position of adjutant to a volunteer corps in a northern city , and , as comparatively new residents , his list of acquaintances was but small .
Parsing [sent. 364 len. 88]: Esmeralda , or to speak more correctly , Joan , the second daughter of the O'Shaughnessy family , as the wife of the millionaire , Geoffrey Hilliard , possessed a beautiful country seat not sixty miles from town , while Jack , the eldest brother , had returned to the home of his fathers , Knock Castle , in Ireland , on the money which his wife had inherited from her father , after he had become engaged to her in her character of a penniless damsel .
Parsing [sent. 365 len. 38]: Jack was thankful all his life to remember that fact , though his easy-going Irish nature found nothing to worry about in the fact that the money was legally his wife 's , and not his own .
Parsing [sent. 366 len. 40]: Both Esmeralda as a society queen , and Sylvia as chatelaine of Knock , had opportunities of showing life to a young girl , with which Bridgie in her modest little home in a provincial town could not compete .
Parsing [sent. 367 len. 28]: Nevertheless , the heart of the tender elder sister was loath to part from her charge at the very moment when watchfulness and guidance were most important .
Parsing [sent. 368 len. 17]: She fought against the idea ; assured herself that there was time , plenty of time .
Parsing [sent. 369 len. 8]: What , after all , was twenty-one ?
Parsing [sent. 370 len. 19]: In two , three years one might talk about society ; in the meantime let the child be !
Parsing [sent. 371 len. 55]: And Captain Victor , in his turn , looked into the future , and saw his Bridgie left sisterless in this strange town , bereft all day long of the society of the sweetest and most understanding of companions , and he , too , sighed , and asked himself what was the hurry .
Parsing [sent. 372 len. 9]: Surely another year , a couple of years !
Parsing [sent. 373 len. 56]: And then , being _ one _ in reality as well as in name , the eyes of husband and wife met and lingered , and , as if at the sweep of an angel 's wing , the selfish thoughts fell away , and they faced their duty and accepted it once for all .
Parsing [sent. 374 len. 13]: Bridgie leaned her head on her husband 's shoulder and sighed thankfully .
Parsing [sent. 375 len. 11]: `` I have you , Dick , and the children !
Parsing [sent. 376 len. 8]: ` Twould be wicked to complain . ''
Parsing [sent. 377 len. 37]: And Dick murmured gruffly -- `` I want no one but you , '' and held her tightly in his arms , while Bridgie sniffed , and whimpered , like one of her own small children .
Parsing [sent. 378 len. 28]: `` But if P-ixie -- _ if _ Pixie is unhappy -- if any wretched man breaks Pixie 's heart -- '' `` He could n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 379 len. 5]: Dick Victor said firmly .
Parsing [sent. 380 len. 5]: `` No man could .
Parsing [sent. 381 len. 5]: That 's beyond them .
Parsing [sent. 382 len. 11]: Heart 's like Pixie 's do n't break , Honey !
Parsing [sent. 383 len. 19]: I do n't say they , may not ache at times , but breaking is a different matter .
Parsing [sent. 384 len. 15]: Your bantling is grown-up : you can keep her no longer beneath your wing .
Parsing [sent. 385 len. 22]: She must go out into the world , and work and suffer like the rest , but she 'll win through .
Parsing [sent. 386 len. 14]: Pixie the woman will be a finer creature than Pixie the child ! ''
Parsing [sent. 387 len. 44]: But Bridgie hid her face , and the tears rushed into her eyes , for hers was the mother 's heart which longed ever to succour and protect , and Pixie was the child whom a dying father had committed to her care .
Parsing [sent. 388 len. 8]: It was hard to let Pixie go .
Parsing [sent. 389 len. 3]: CHAPTER FOUR .
Parsing [sent. 390 len. 3]: THE INVITATION .
Parsing [sent. 391 len. 32]: The immediate consequence of the Pixie pronouncement was a correspondence between her two elder sisters , wherein Bridgie ate humble-pie , and Esmeralda rode the high horse after the manner born .
Parsing [sent. 392 len. 9]: `` You were right about Pixie , darling .
Parsing [sent. 393 len. 39]: It _ is _ dull for her here in this strange town , where we have _ so _ few friends ; and now that she is nearly twenty-one it does not seem right to shut her up .
Parsing [sent. 394 len. 20]: She ought to go about and see the world , and meet boys and girls of her own age .
Parsing [sent. 395 len. 25]: And so , dear , would it be convenient to you to have her for a few months until you go up to town ?
Parsing [sent. 396 len. 49]: Your life in the country will seem a whirl of gaiety after our monotonous jog-trot , and she has been so useful and diligent , helping me these last years with never a thought for her own enjoyment , that she deserves all the fun she can get .
Parsing [sent. 397 len. 21]: I am sad at parting from her , but if it 's for her good I 'll make the effort .
Parsing [sent. 398 len. 17]: She has two nice new frocks , and I could get her another for parties . ''
Parsing [sent. 399 len. 3]: Thus Bridgie .
Parsing [sent. 400 len. 32]: Esmeralda 's reply came by return -- the big , slanting writing , plentifully underlined -- '' _ At last _ , my dear , you have come to your senses .
Parsing [sent. 401 len. 22]: For a sweet-tempered person , you certainly have , as I 've told you before , a surprising amount of obstinacy .
Parsing [sent. 402 len. 22]: In future do try to believe that in matters of worldly wisdom I know best , and be ruled by me !
Parsing [sent. 403 len. 26]: `` Pixie can come at once -- the sooner the better , but for pity 's sake , my dear , spare me the frocks .
Parsing [sent. 404 len. 20]: Felice can run her up a few things to last until I have time to take her to town .
Parsing [sent. 405 len. 25]: If I am to take her about , she must be dressed to please _ me _ , and do _ me _ credit .
Parsing [sent. 406 len. 20]: `` We have people coming and going all the time , and I 'll be thankful to have her .
Parsing [sent. 407 len. 21]: I would n't say so for the world , Bridgie , but you _ have _ been selfish about Pixie !
Parsing [sent. 408 len. 58]: Never a bit of her have I had to myself ; she has come for the regular Christmas visits , of course , and sometimes in summer , but it 's always been with you and Dick and the children ; it 's only the leavings of attention she 's had to spare for any one else .
Parsing [sent. 409 len. 8]: Now my boys will have a chance !
Parsing [sent. 410 len. 14]: Perhaps she can keep them in order -- _ I _ ca n't !
Parsing [sent. 411 len. 30]: They are the pride and the shame , and the joy and the grief , and the sunshine and the -- thunder and lightning and earthquake of my life .
Parsing [sent. 412 len. 16]: Bridgie , did you ever think it would feel like that to be a mother ?
Parsing [sent. 413 len. 59]: I thought it would be all pure joy , but there 's a big ache mixed in -- `` Geoff was so naughty this morning , so disobedient and rude , and I prayed , Bridgie -- I shut myself in my room and prayed for patience , and then went down and spoke to him so sweetly .
Parsing [sent. 414 len. 8]: You 'd have loved to hear me .
Parsing [sent. 415 len. 27]: I said : ` If you want to grow up a good , wise man like father , you must learn to be gentle and polite .
Parsing [sent. 416 len. 11]: Did you ever hear father speak rudely to me ? '
Parsing [sent. 417 len. 28]: -- ` Oh , no , ' says he , quite simply , ` _ but I 've often heard you speak rudely to him _ ! '
Parsing [sent. 418 len. 13]: Now , what was a poor misguided mother to say to that ?
Parsing [sent. 419 len. 6]: Especially when it was True !
Parsing [sent. 420 len. 21]: You are never cross , so your youngsters can never corner you like that ; but I am -- often !
Parsing [sent. 421 len. 19]: Which proves that I need Pixie more than you do , and she 'd better hurry along . ''
Parsing [sent. 422 len. 19]: Pixie came lightly into the dining-room , just as Bridgie was reading the last words of the letter .
Parsing [sent. 423 len. 22]: She was almost invariably late for breakfast , a fact which was annoying to Captain Victor 's soldierly sense of punctuality .
Parsing [sent. 424 len. 19]: He looked markedly at the clock , and Pixie said genially , `` I apologise , me dear .
Parsing [sent. 425 len. 6]: The young need sleep ! ''
Parsing [sent. 426 len. 12]: Then she fell to work at her porridge with healthy enjoyment .
Parsing [sent. 427 len. 22]: She wore a blue serge skirt and a bright , red silk shirt , neatly belted by a strip of patent-leather .
Parsing [sent. 428 len. 30]: The once straggly locks were parted in the middle , and swathed round a little head which held itself jauntily aloft ; her eyes danced , her lips curved .
Parsing [sent. 429 len. 20]: It was a bare eight o'clock in the morning , a period when most people are languid and half-awake .
Parsing [sent. 430 len. 15]: But there was no languor about Pixie ; she looked intensely , brilliantly alive .
Parsing [sent. 431 len. 17]: A stream of vitality seemed to emanate from her little form and fill the whole room .
Parsing [sent. 432 len. 43]: The dog stirred on the rug and rose to his feet ; the canary hopped to a higher perch and began to sing ; Dick Victor felt an access of appetite , and helped himself to a second egg and more bacon .
Parsing [sent. 433 len. 16]: `` This is Wednesday , '' announced Pixie genially , `` and it 's fine .
Parsing [sent. 434 len. 5]: I love fine Wednesdays !
Parsing [sent. 435 len. 20]: It 's a habit from the old school-time , when they were half-holidays , and meant so , much .
Parsing [sent. 436 len. 11]: ... I wonder what nice thing will happen to-day . ''
Parsing [sent. 437 len. 7]: Husband and wife exchanged a glance .
Parsing [sent. 438 len. 36]: They knew and loved this habit of expecting happiness , and looking forward to the joys rather than the sorrows of the future , which had all her life , been characteristic of Pixie O'Shaughnessy .
Parsing [sent. 439 len. 43]: They realised that it was to this quality of mind , rather than to external happenings , that she owed her cheerful serenity , but this morning it was impossible not to wonder how she would view the proposed change of abode .
Parsing [sent. 440 len. 32]: `` I 've had a letter from Esmeralda , '' announced Bridgie baldly from behind the urn , and , quick as thought , Pixie 's sharp eyes searched her face .
Parsing [sent. 441 len. 7]: `` But that 's not nice .
Parsing [sent. 442 len. 7]: It 's given you a wrinkle .
Parsing [sent. 443 len. 15]: Take no notice , and she 'll write to-morrow to say she 's sorry .
Parsing [sent. 444 len. 19]: She 's got to worry or die , but there 's no reason why you should die too .
Parsing [sent. 445 len. 13]: Roll it up into spills , and forget all about it . ''
Parsing [sent. 446 len. 9]: `` I ca n't -- it 's important .
Parsing [sent. 447 len. 6]: And she 's not worrying .
Parsing [sent. 448 len. 27]: It 's very -- '' Bridgie paused for a moment , just one moment , to swallow that accusation of selfishness -- '' _ kind _ !
Parsing [sent. 449 len. 11]: Pixie darling , it 's about _ You _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 450 len. 4]: `` Me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 451 len. 11]: cried Pixie , and dropped her spoon with a clang .
Parsing [sent. 452 len. 18]: Bridgie had already pushed back her chair from the table ; Pixie pushed hers to follow suit .
Parsing [sent. 453 len. 40]: Such a prosaic affair as breakfast had plainly vanished from their thoughts , but Captain Victor had by no means forgotten , nor did it suit him to face emotional scenes to an accompaniment of bacon and eggs . ''
Parsing [sent. 454 len. 8]: _ After _ breakfast , please ! ''
Parsing [sent. 455 len. 47]: he cried , in what his wife described as his `` barracks '' voice , and which had the effect in this instance of making her turn on the tap of the urn so hurriedly that she had not had time to place her cup underneath .
Parsing [sent. 456 len. 5]: She blushed and frowned .
Parsing [sent. 457 len. 23]: Pixie deftly moved the toast-rack so as to conceal the damage , and proceeded to eat a hearty breakfast with undiminished appetite .
Parsing [sent. 458 len. 38]: It was not until Captain Victor had left the room to pay his morning visit to the nursery , that Bridgie again referred to her sister 's letter , and then her first words were of reproach .
Parsing [sent. 459 len. 32]: `` How you could sit there , Pixie , eating your breakfast , as calm as you please , when you knew there was news -- news that concerned yourself ! ''
Parsing [sent. 460 len. 10]: `` I was hungry , '' said Pixie calmly .
Parsing [sent. 461 len. 14]: `` And I love excitement ; it 's the breath of my nostrils .
Parsing [sent. 462 len. 14]: All the while I was making up stories , with myself as heroine .
Parsing [sent. 463 len. 16]: I 'm afraid it will be only disappointment I 'll feel when you tell me .
Parsing [sent. 464 len. 9]: Truth is so tame , compared to imagination .
Parsing [sent. 465 len. 7]: Besides , there was Dick ! ''
Parsing [sent. 466 len. 8]: She smiled a forbearing , elderly smile .
Parsing [sent. 467 len. 14]: `` You ca n't live in the house with Dick without learning self-control .
Parsing [sent. 468 len. 11]: He 's so -- '' `` He 's not ! ''
Parsing [sent. 469 len. 9]: contradicted Dick 's wife , with loyal fervour .
Parsing [sent. 470 len. 10]: `` Dick was quite right ; he always is .
Parsing [sent. 471 len. 14]: It was his parents who were to blame for making him English . ''
Parsing [sent. 472 len. 11]: She sighed , and stared reflectively out of the window .
Parsing [sent. 473 len. 17]: `` We ought to be thankful , Pixie , that we are Irish through and through .
Parsing [sent. 474 len. 50]: It means so much that English people ca n't even understand -- seeing jokes when they are sad , and happiness when they are bored and being poor and not caring , and miserable and forgetting , and interested , and excited -- '' `` Every single hour ! ''
Parsing [sent. 475 len. 10]: concluded Pixie deeply , and they laughed in concert .
Parsing [sent. 476 len. 39]: In the contemplation of the advantages of an Irish temperament they had come near forgetting the real subject of discussion , but the sight of the letter on the table before her recalled it to Bridgie 's remembrance .
Parsing [sent. 477 len. 25]: She straightened her back and assumed an air of responsibility , a natural dramatic instinct prompting her to play her part in appropriate fashion .
Parsing [sent. 478 len. 49]: `` Dick and I have been feeling , my dear , that as you are now really grown-up , you ought to be having a livelier time than we can give you in this strange town , and Esmeralda has been saying the same thing for years past .
Parsing [sent. 479 len. 33]: She feels we have been rather selfish in keeping you so much to ourselves , and thinks that it is her turn to have you to live with her for a time .
Parsing [sent. 480 len. 7]: We think so too , Pixie .
Parsing [sent. 481 len. 7]: Not for altogether , of course .
Parsing [sent. 482 len. 26]: For three or four months , say ; and then you might go over to Knock , and come back to us again for Christmas .
Parsing [sent. 483 len. 19]: Of course , darling , you understand that we do n't _ want _ you to go ! ''
Parsing [sent. 484 len. 7]: Pixie stared silently across the table .
Parsing [sent. 485 len. 15]: She had grown rather white , and her brows were knitted in anxious consideration .
Parsing [sent. 486 len. 43]: `` Bridget Victor , '' she said solemnly , `` is it the truth , the whole truth , and nothing but the truth you are telling me , or is it just an excuse to get me out of the way ?
Parsing [sent. 487 len. 68]: If there 's any trouble , or worry , or illness , or upset coming on , that you want to spare me because I 'm young , you 'd better know at once that it will only be the expense of the journey wasted , for on the very first breath of it I 'd fly back to you if it was across the world ! ''
Parsing [sent. 488 len. 15]: `` I know it , '' said Bridgie , and blinked back a tear .
Parsing [sent. 489 len. 45]: `` But it 's the whole truth , and nothing but the truth , Pixie , that we are the happiest , and the healthiest , and the contentedest little family in the country , and there 's no need to worry about us .
Parsing [sent. 490 len. 21]: We were thinking only of you , and you are free in this instance to think only of yourself . ''
Parsing [sent. 491 len. 6]: `` That 's agreeable ! ''
Parsing [sent. 492 len. 5]: was Pixie 's comment .
Parsing [sent. 493 len. 36]: The frown left her brow and she smiled , the wide lips parting to show brilliantly white little teeth , teeth very nearly as pretty and infantile as those belonging to the small Patsie upstairs .
Parsing [sent. 494 len. 27]: Beholding that smile , Bridgie had no doubt as to the verdict which she was about to hear , and suffered an unreasoning pang of disappointment .
Parsing [sent. 495 len. 28]: `` Then I 'll confess to you , my dear , '' continued Pixie affably , `` that I find myself just in the mood for excitement .
Parsing [sent. 496 len. 27]: So long as you are well there 's nothing on earth I 'd love so much at this moment as to go off on a junket .
Parsing [sent. 497 len. 26]: If Esmeralda wants to give me a good time , let the poor thing have her way -- _ I 'll _ not hinder her !
Parsing [sent. 498 len. 29]: I 'll go , and I 'll love it ; but I 'll not promise how long I shall stay -- all sorts of things may happen . ''
Parsing [sent. 499 len. 15]: `` Yes , '' said Bridgie dreamily , `` all sorts of things ! ''
Parsing [sent. 500 len. 11]: And so Pixie O'Shaughnessy went forth to meet her fate .
Parsing [sent. 501 len. 3]: CHAPTER FIVE .
Parsing [sent. 502 len. 4]: IN MARBLE HALLS .
Parsing [sent. 503 len. 44]: Mrs Geoffrey Hilliard , _ nee _ Joan O'Shaughnessy , was the second daughter of the family , and had been christened Esmeralda `` for short '' by the brothers and sisters of whom she had been alternately the pride and the trial .
Parsing [sent. 504 len. 38]: The fantastic name had an appropriateness so undeniable that even Joan 's husband had adopted it in his turn for use in the family circle , reserving the more dignified `` Joan '' for more ceremonious occasions .
Parsing [sent. 505 len. 60]: `` Esmeralda '' had been a beauty from her cradle , and would be a beauty if she lived to be a hundred , for her proud , restless features were perfectly chiselled , and her great grey eyes , with the long black lashes on the upper and lower lid , were as eloquent as they were lovely .
Parsing [sent. 506 len. 62]: When she was angry , they seemed to send out veritable flashes of fire ; when she was languid , the white lids drooped and the fringed eyelashes veiled them in a misty calm ; when she was loving , when she held her boys in her arms , or spoke a love word in her husband 's ear , ah !
Parsing [sent. 507 len. 15]: Then it was a joy indeed to behold the beauty of those limpid eyes !
Parsing [sent. 508 len. 20]: They `` melted '' indeed , not with tears , but with the very essence of tenderness and love .
Parsing [sent. 509 len. 16]: `` Esmeralda 's so nice that you could n't believe she was so horrid ! ''
Parsing [sent. 510 len. 21]: Pixie had declared once in her earlier years , and unfortunately there was still too much truth in the pronouncement .
Parsing [sent. 511 len. 34]: Seven years of matrimony , and the responsibility of two young sons , had failed to discipline the hasty , intolerant nature , although they had certainly deepened the inner longing for improvement .
Parsing [sent. 512 len. 26]: Joan devotedly loved her husband , but accepted as her right his loyal devotion , and felt bitterly aggrieved when his forbearance occasionally gave way .
Parsing [sent. 513 len. 29]: She adored her two small sons , and her theories on motherhood were so sweet and lofty that Bridgie , listening thereto , had been moved to tears .
Parsing [sent. 514 len. 13]: But in practice the theories were apt to go to the wall .
Parsing [sent. 515 len. 97]: To do Joan justice she would at any time have marched cheerfully to the stake if by so doing she could have saved her children from peril , but she was incapable of being patient during one long rainy afternoon , when confinement in the house had aroused into full play those mischievous instincts characteristic of healthy and spirited youngsters ; and if any one imagines that the two statements contradict each other , he has yet to learn that heroic heights of effort are easier of accomplishment than a steady jog-trot along a dull high-road .
Parsing [sent. 516 len. 18]: Joan Hilliard 's reflections on the coming of her younger sister were significant of her mental attitude .
Parsing [sent. 517 len. 6]: `` Pixie 's no trouble .
Parsing [sent. 518 len. 7]: She 's such an easy soul .
Parsing [sent. 519 len. 10]: She fits into corners and fills in the gaps .
Parsing [sent. 520 len. 6]: She 'll amuse the boys .
Parsing [sent. 521 len. 15]: It will keep them in good humour to have her to invent new games .
Parsing [sent. 522 len. 12]: She 'll keep Geoff company at breakfast when I 'm tired .
Parsing [sent. 523 len. 14]: I 'll get some of the duty visits over while she 's here .
Parsing [sent. 524 len. 28]: She 'll talk to the bores , and be so pleased at the sound of her own voice that she 'll never notice they do n't answer .
Parsing [sent. 525 len. 13]: And she 'll cheer me up when _ I 'm _ bored .
Parsing [sent. 526 len. 75]: And , of course , I 'll take her about -- '' Pixie 's amusement , it will be noticed , was but a secondary consideration to Joan 's own ease and comfort ; for though it may be a very enjoyable experience to be a society beauty and exchange poverty for riches , no one will be brave enough to maintain that such an experience is conducive to the growth of spiritual qualities .
Parsing [sent. 527 len. 20]: Sweet-hearted Bridgie might possibly have come unscathed through the ordeal , but Esmeralda was made of a different clay .
Parsing [sent. 528 len. 62]: Pixie started alone on the three hours ' journey , for the Victor household possessed no maid who could be spared , and husband and wife were both tied by home duties ; moreover , being a modern young woman , she felt perfectly competent to look after herself , and looked forward to the experience with pleasure rather than dread .
Parsing [sent. 529 len. 30]: Bridgie was inclined to be tearful at parting , and Pixie 's artistic sense prompted a similar display , but she found herself simply incapable of forcing a tear .
Parsing [sent. 530 len. 26]: `` It 's worse for you than for me , '' she confessed candidly , `` for you 've nothing to do , poor creature !
Parsing [sent. 531 len. 18]: But go home to cold mutton and darning , while I 'm off to novelty and adventure .
Parsing [sent. 532 len. 34]: That 's why the guests sometimes cry at a wedding , out of pity for themselves , because they ca n't go off on a honeymoon with a trousseau and an adoring groom .
Parsing [sent. 533 len. 22]: They pretend it 's sympathetic emotion , but it is n't ; it 's nothing in the world but selfish regret .
Parsing [sent. 534 len. 14]: ... Do n't cry , darling ; it makes me feel so mean .
Parsing [sent. 535 len. 16]: Think of the lovely _ tete-a-tete _ this will mean for Dick and you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 536 len. 7]: `` Yes -- in the evenings .
Parsing [sent. 537 len. 6]: I 'll love that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 538 len. 10]: confessed Bridgie , with the candour of her race .
Parsing [sent. 539 len. 33]: `` But oh , Pixie , the long , dull days , and no one to laugh with me at the jokes the English ca n't see , or to make pretend !
Parsing [sent. 540 len. 6]: -- '' `` Ah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 541 len. 12]: mourned Pixie deeply , `` I 'll miss that , too !
Parsing [sent. 542 len. 22]: The times we 've had , imagining a fortune arriving by the afternoon post , and spending it all before dinner !
Parsing [sent. 543 len. 10]: All the fun , and none of the trouble .
Parsing [sent. 544 len. 10]: But it 's dull , imagining all by oneself !
Parsing [sent. 545 len. 6]: And Dick 's no good .
Parsing [sent. 546 len. 7]: He calls it waste of time !
Parsing [sent. 547 len. 14]: I shall marry an Irishman , Bridgie , when my time comes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 548 len. 12]: `` Get into the train and do n't talk nonsense ! ''
Parsing [sent. 549 len. 4]: said Bridgie firmly .
Parsing [sent. 550 len. 33]: She felt it prophetic that on this eve of departure Pixie 's remarks should again touch on husbands and weddings , but not for the world would she have hinted as much .
Parsing [sent. 551 len. 40]: She glanced at the other occupant of the carriage -- a stout , middle-aged woman , and was on the point of inviting her chaperonage when a warning gleam in Pixie 's eyes silenced the words on her lips .
Parsing [sent. 552 len. 31]: So presently the train puffed out of the station , and Bridgie Victor turned sadly homewards even as Pixie seated herself with a bounce , and smiled complacently into space .
Parsing [sent. 553 len. 6]: `` That 's over ! ''
Parsing [sent. 554 len. 31]: she said to herself with a sigh of relief , glad as ever , to be done with painful things and able to look forward to the good to come .
Parsing [sent. 555 len. 30]: `` She thinks she 's miserable , the darling , but she 'll be as happy as a grig the moment she gets back to Dick and the children .
Parsing [sent. 556 len. 10]: That 's the worst of living with married sisters !
Parsing [sent. 557 len. 8]: They can manage so well without you .
Parsing [sent. 558 len. 34]: I 'd prefer some one who was frantic if I turned my back -- '' She smiled at the thought , and met an ingratiating smile upon the face of her travelling companion .
Parsing [sent. 559 len. 17]: The companion was stout and elderly , handsomely dressed , and evidently of a sociable disposition .
Parsing [sent. 560 len. 36]: It was the height of her ambition on a railway journey to meet another woman to whom she could shout confidences for hours upon end , but it was rarely that her sentiments were returned .
Parsing [sent. 561 len. 16]: Fate had been kind to her to-day in placing Pixie O'Shaughnessy in the same carriage .
Parsing [sent. 562 len. 11]: `` The young lady seemed quite distressed to leave you .
Parsing [sent. 563 len. 6]: Is she your sister ? ''
Parsing [sent. 564 len. 4]: `` She is .
Parsing [sent. 565 len. 8]: Do you think we are alike ? ''
Parsing [sent. 566 len. 17]: `` I -- I would n't go so far as to say _ alike _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 567 len. 15]: the large lady said blandly ; `` but there 's a _ look _ !
Parsing [sent. 568 len. 17]: As I always say , there 's no knowing where you are with a family likeness .
Parsing [sent. 569 len. 34]: My eldest girl -- May -- takes after her father ; Felicia , the youngest , is the image of myself ; yet they 've been mistaken for each other times and again .
Parsing [sent. 570 len. 8]: It 's a turn of the chin .
Parsing [sent. 571 len. 6]: -- Is she married ? ''
Parsing [sent. 572 len. 3]: `` Who ?
Parsing [sent. 573 len. 5]: Bridgie -- my sister ?
Parsing [sent. 574 len. 6]: Oh yes -- very much .
Parsing [sent. 575 len. 4]: Six years . ''
Parsing [sent. 576 len. 4]: `` Dear me !
Parsing [sent. 577 len. 5]: She looks so young !
Parsing [sent. 578 len. 5]: My May is twenty-seven .
Parsing [sent. 579 len. 9]: She has had her chances , of course .
Parsing [sent. 580 len. 4]: Any children ? ''
Parsing [sent. 581 len. 13]: `` Wh -- '' Pixie 's mind again struggled after the connection .
Parsing [sent. 582 len. 11]: `` Oh , two -- a boy and a girl .
Parsing [sent. 583 len. 23]: They are called , '' she added , with a benevolent consciousness of sparing further effort , `` Patrick and Patricia . ''
Parsing [sent. 584 len. 12]: `` Irish , evidently , '' the large lady decided shrewdly .
Parsing [sent. 585 len. 20]: `` Rather awkward , is n't it , about pet names , and laundry marks , and so forth ?
Parsing [sent. 586 len. 2]: However .
Parsing [sent. 587 len. 22]: ... And so you 've been paying her a visit , I suppose , and are returning to your home ? ''
Parsing [sent. 588 len. 11]: `` One of my homes , '' corrected Pixie happily .
Parsing [sent. 589 len. 5]: `` I have three .
Parsing [sent. 590 len. 6]: Two sisters and one brother .
Parsing [sent. 591 len. 8]: And they all like to have me .
Parsing [sent. 592 len. 6]: My parents are dead . ''
Parsing [sent. 593 len. 32]: Her tone showed that the loss referred to was of many years ' standing ; nevertheless , the stout lady hurriedly changed the conversation , as though fearful of painful reminiscences .
Parsing [sent. 594 len. 10]: `` I have been having a morning 's shopping .
Parsing [sent. 595 len. 22]: We live _ quite _ in the country , and I come to town every time I need a new gown .
Parsing [sent. 596 len. 13]: I have been arranging for one this morning , for a wedding .
Parsing [sent. 597 len. 9]: So difficult , when one has no ideas !
Parsing [sent. 598 len. 5]: I chose purple . ''
Parsing [sent. 599 len. 13]: Pixie cocked her head on one side and thoughtfully pursed her lips .
Parsing [sent. 600 len. 4]: `` Very nice !
Parsing [sent. 601 len. 11]: Yes , purple 's so -- _ portly _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 602 len. 18]: She surprised a puckering of the large lady 's face , and hastened to supplement the description .
Parsing [sent. 603 len. 19]: `` Portly , and -- er -- regal , and _ duchessy _ , do n't you think ?
Parsing [sent. 604 len. 20]: I met a duchess once -- she was rather like you -- and _ she _ wore purple ! ''
Parsing [sent. 605 len. 9]: The large lady expanded in a genial warmth .
Parsing [sent. 606 len. 16]: Her lips opened in a breathless question -- `` How was the bodice made ? ''
Parsing [sent. 607 len. 4]: Pixie reflected deeply .
Parsing [sent. 608 len. 9]: `` I ca n't exactly _ say _ !
Parsing [sent. 609 len. 6]: But it was years ago .
Parsing [sent. 610 len. 8]: It would be quite _ demode _ .
Parsing [sent. 611 len. 14]: For a wedding , of course , you must be up to date .
Parsing [sent. 612 len. 21]: Weddings make a fuss for months , and are so _ soon _ over -- I mean for the guests .
Parsing [sent. 613 len. 9]: They are not _ much _ fun . ''
Parsing [sent. 614 len. 9]: `` Where did you meet the Duchess ? ''
Parsing [sent. 615 len. 16]: `` Oh , at my sister 's -- the one I am going to now .
Parsing [sent. 616 len. 11]: In her town house , at a reception one afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 617 len. 51]: She had a purple dress with lace , and a Queen Victoria sort of bonnet with strings , and little white feathers sticking up in the front ; and she had a -- '' Pixie smiled into space with reminiscent enjoyment -- '' _ beautiful _ sense of humour ! ''
Parsing [sent. 618 len. 55]: The large lady looked deeply impressed , and , beginning at the topmost ribbon on Pixie 's hat , stared steadily downward to the tip of the little patent-leather shoe , evidently expecting to find points of unusual interest in the costume of a girl whose sister entertained a duchess in her town house .
Parsing [sent. 619 len. 20]: The train had rattled through a small hamlet and come out again into the open before she spoke again .
Parsing [sent. 620 len. 9]: `` Do you see many of them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 621 len. 3]: `` Which ?
Parsing [sent. 622 len. 2]: What ?
Parsing [sent. 623 len. 2]: Bonnets ?
Parsing [sent. 624 len. 2]: Feathers ?
Parsing [sent. 625 len. 12]: I do n't think I quite -- '' `` Duchesses ! ''
Parsing [sent. 626 len. 6]: said the large lady deeply .
Parsing [sent. 627 len. 31]: And Pixie , who still preserved her childish love of cutting a dash , fought with , and overcame an unworthy temptation to invent several such titles on the spot .
Parsing [sent. 628 len. 28]: `` Not -- many , '' she confessed humbly , `` But , you see , I 'm so young -- I 'm hardly ` out . '
Parsing [sent. 629 len. 15]: The sister with whom I 've been living has not been able to entertain .
Parsing [sent. 630 len. 8]: Where I 'm going it is different .
Parsing [sent. 631 len. 8]: I expect to be very gay . ''
Parsing [sent. 632 len. 6]: The large lady nodded brightly .
Parsing [sent. 633 len. 4]: `` Quite right !
Parsing [sent. 634 len. 3]: Quite right !
Parsing [sent. 635 len. 4]: Only young once .
Parsing [sent. 636 len. 5]: Laugh while you may .
Parsing [sent. 637 len. 9]: I like to see young things enjoying themselves .
Parsing [sent. 638 len. 13]: ... And then you 'll be getting engaged , and marrying . ''
Parsing [sent. 639 len. 44]: `` Oh , of course , '' assented Pixie , with an alacrity in such sharp contrast with the protests with which the modern girl sees fit to meet such prophecies , that the hearer was smitten not only with surprise but anxiety .
Parsing [sent. 640 len. 23]: An expression of real motherly kindliness shone in her eyes as she fixed them upon the girl 's small , radiant face .
Parsing [sent. 641 len. 30]: `` I hope it will be ` of course , ' dear , and that you may be very , very happy ; but it 's a serious question .
Parsing [sent. 642 len. 11]: I 'm an old-fashioned body , who believes in love .
Parsing [sent. 643 len. 24]: If it 's the real thing it _ lasts _ , and it 's about the only thing upon which you can count .
Parsing [sent. 644 len. 10]: Health comes and goes , and riches take wing .
Parsing [sent. 645 len. 25]: When I married Papa he was in tin-plates , and doing well , but owing to American treaties -LRB- you would n't understand ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 646 len. 13]: we had to put down servants and move into a smaller house .
Parsing [sent. 647 len. 20]: Now , if I 'd married him for money , how should I have felt _ then _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 648 len. 12]: Pixie wagged her head with an air of the deepest dejection .
Parsing [sent. 649 len. 18]: She was speculating as to the significance of tin-plates , but thought it tactful not to inquire .
Parsing [sent. 650 len. 39]: `` I hope -- '' she breathed deeply -- `` I hope the tin-plates -- '' and her companion gathered together her satchel and cloak in readiness for departure at the next station , nodding a cheerful reassurance .
Parsing [sent. 651 len. 11]: `` Oh , yes ; _ quite _ prosperous again !
Parsing [sent. 652 len. 5]: Have been for years .
Parsing [sent. 653 len. 5]: But it only shows .
Parsing [sent. 654 len. 8]: ... And Papa has attacks of gout .
Parsing [sent. 655 len. 31]: They are trying , my dear , to _ me _ , as well as to himself ; but if you love a man -- well , it comes easier .
Parsing [sent. 656 len. 6]: ... Here 's my station .
Parsing [sent. 657 len. 7]: So glad to have met you !
Parsing [sent. 658 len. 8]: I 'll remember about the purple . ''
Parsing [sent. 659 len. 28]: The train stopped , and the good lady alighted and passed through the wicket-gate , and her late companion watched her pass with a sentimental sigh . ''
Parsing [sent. 660 len. 16]: ` Ships that pass in the night , and signal each other in passing . '
Parsing [sent. 661 len. 11]: She took to me , and I took to her .
Parsing [sent. 662 len. 28]: She 'll talk about me all evening to May and Felicia , and the tin-plate Papa , and ten chances to one we 'll never meet again .
Parsing [sent. 663 len. 12]: ` It 's a sad world , my masters ! ' ''
Parsing [sent. 664 len. 13]: sighed Pixie , and dived in her bag for a chocolate support .
Parsing [sent. 665 len. 58]: The rest of the journey brought no companion so confidential , and Pixie was heartily glad to arrive at her destination , and as the train slackened speed to run into the station , to catch a glimpse of Esmeralda sitting straight and stately in a high cart ready to drive her visitor back to the Hall .
Parsing [sent. 666 len. 64]: Motors were very well in their way -- useful trainlets ready to call at one 's own door and whirl one direct to the place where one would be , but the girl who had hunted with her father since she was a baby of four years old was never _ so _ happy as when she was in command of a horse .
Parsing [sent. 667 len. 28]: As the new-comer climbed up into the high seat the beautiful face was turned towards her with a smile as sweet and loving as Bridgie 's own .
Parsing [sent. 668 len. 5]: `` Well , Pixie !
Parsing [sent. 669 len. 8]: Ah , dearie , this is good .
Parsing [sent. 670 len. 8]: I 've got you at last . ''
Parsing [sent. 671 len. 7]: `` Esmeralda , _ darling _ !
Parsing [sent. 672 len. 7]: What an angel you look ! ''
Parsing [sent. 673 len. 29]: `` Do n't kiss me in public , _ please _ , '' snapped Esmeralda , becoming prosaic with startling rapidity at the first hint of visible demonstration .
Parsing [sent. 674 len. 22]: She signalled to the groom , and off they went , trotting down the country lane in great contentment of spirits .
Parsing [sent. 675 len. 6]: `` How 's everybody ? ''
Parsing [sent. 676 len. 3]: asked Esmeralda .
Parsing [sent. 677 len. 3]: `` Well ?
Parsing [sent. 678 len. 4]: That 's right .
Parsing [sent. 679 len. 9]: You can tell me the details later on .
Parsing [sent. 680 len. 19]: Now , you have just to forget Bridgie for a bit , and think of _ Me _ .
Parsing [sent. 681 len. 22]: I 've wanted you for years , and I told Bridgie to her face she was selfish to keep you away .
Parsing [sent. 682 len. 24]: If I 'm not a good example , you can take example by my faults , and is n't that just as good ?
Parsing [sent. 683 len. 12]: And there 's so much that I want you to do .
Parsing [sent. 684 len. 13]: You always loved to help , did n't you , Pixie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 685 len. 24]: `` I did , '' assented Pixie , but the quick ears of the listener detected a hint of hesitation in the sound .
Parsing [sent. 686 len. 59]: The dark eyebrows arched in haughty questioning , and Pixie , no whit abashed , shrugged her shoulders and confessed with a laugh : `` But to tell you the truth , my dear , it was not so much for helping , as for having a good time for myself , that I started on this trip .
Parsing [sent. 687 len. 40]: Bridgie said I 'd been domestic long enough , and needed to play for a change , and there 's a well of something bubbling up inside me that longs , simply _ longs _ , for a vent .
Parsing [sent. 688 len. 27]: Of course , if one could combine the two ... '' Joan Hilliard looked silently into the girl 's bright face and made a mental comparison .
Parsing [sent. 689 len. 80]: She thought of the round of change and amusement which constituted her own life , and then of the little house in the northern city in which Pixie 's last years had been spent ; of the monotonous , if happy , round of duties , every day the same , from year 's end to year 's end , of the shortage of means , of friends , of opportunities , and a wave of compunction overwhelmed her .
Parsing [sent. 690 len. 18]: Esmeralda never did things by halves ; neither had she any false shame about confessing her faults .
Parsing [sent. 691 len. 12]: `` I 'm a selfish brute , '' she announced bluntly .
Parsing [sent. 692 len. 7]: `` I deserve to be punished .
Parsing [sent. 693 len. 14]: If I go on like this I _ shall _ be some day !
Parsing [sent. 694 len. 19]: I 'm always thinking of myself , when I 'm not in a temper with some one else .
Parsing [sent. 695 len. 18]: It 's an awful thing , Pixie , to be born into the world with a temper .
Parsing [sent. 696 len. 11]: And now , Geoff has inherited it from me . ''
Parsing [sent. 697 len. 11]: She sighed , shook the reins , and brightened resolutely .
Parsing [sent. 698 len. 15]: `` Never mind , you _ shall _ have a good time , darling !
Parsing [sent. 699 len. 30]: There 's a girl staying in the house now -- you 'll like her -- and two young men , and lots of people coming in and out . ''
Parsing [sent. 700 len. 8]: Pixie heaved a sigh of beatific content .
Parsing [sent. 701 len. 3]: `` To-night ?
Parsing [sent. 702 len. 3]: At once ?
Parsing [sent. 703 len. 15]: That 's what I love -- to tumble pell-mell into a whirl of dissipation .
Parsing [sent. 704 len. 7]: I never could bear to wait .
Parsing [sent. 705 len. 17]: I 'm pining to see Geoffrey and the boys , and all your wonderful new possessions .
Parsing [sent. 706 len. 23]: You must be happy , Esmeralda , to have so much , and be so well , and pretty , and rich .
Parsing [sent. 707 len. 8]: Are n't you just burstingly happy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 708 len. 5]: Joan did not answer .
Parsing [sent. 709 len. 19]: She stared ahead over the horse 's head with a strange , rapt look in the wonderful eyes .
Parsing [sent. 710 len. 24]: An artist would have loved to paint her at that moment , but it would not have been as a type of happiness .
Parsing [sent. 711 len. 33]: The expression spoke rather of struggle , of restlessness , and want -- a spiritual want which lay ever at the back of the excitement and glamour , clamouring to be filled .
Parsing [sent. 712 len. 15]: Pixie looked at her sister , just once , and then averted her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 713 len. 22]: Hers was the understanding which springs from love , and she realised that her simple question had struck a tender spot .
Parsing [sent. 714 len. 26]: Instead of waiting for an answer she switched the conversation to ordinary , impersonal topics , and kept it there until the house was reached .
Parsing [sent. 715 len. 22]: Tea was waiting in the large inner hall , and the girl visitor came forward to be introduced and shake hands .
Parsing [sent. 716 len. 31]: She was a slim , fair creature with masses of hair of a pale flaxen hue , swathed round her head , and held in place by large amber pins .
Parsing [sent. 717 len. 24]: Not a hair was out of place -- the effect was more like a bandage of pale brown silk than ordinary human locks .
Parsing [sent. 718 len. 28]: Her dress was made in the extreme of the skimpy fashion , and her little feet were encased in the most immaculate of silk shoes and stockings .
Parsing [sent. 719 len. 19]: She looked Pixie over in one quick , appraising glance , and Pixie stared back with widened eyes .
Parsing [sent. 720 len. 11]: `` My sister , Patricia O'Shaughnessy , '' declaimed Esmeralda .
Parsing [sent. 721 len. 13]: Whereupon the strange girl bowed and repeated , `` Miss Pat-ricia O'Shaughnessy .
Parsing [sent. 722 len. 25]: Pleased to meet you , '' in a manner which proclaimed her American birth as unmistakably as a flourish of the Stars and Stripes .
Parsing [sent. 723 len. 33]: Then tea was brought in , and two young men joined the party , followed by the host , Geoffrey Hilliard , who gave the warmest of welcomes to his little sister-in-law .
Parsing [sent. 724 len. 39]: His kiss , the grasp of his hand , spoke of a deeper feeling than one of mere welcome , and Pixie had an instant perception that Geoffrey , like his wife , felt in need of help .
Parsing [sent. 725 len. 56]: The first glance had shown him more worn and tired than a man should be who has youth , health , a beautiful wife , charming children , and more money than he knows how to spend ; but whatever hidden troubles might exist , they were not allowed to shadow this hour of meeting .
Parsing [sent. 726 len. 13]: `` Sure , and this is a sight for sore eyes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 727 len. 12]: he cried , with a would-be adaptation of an Irish accent .
Parsing [sent. 728 len. 12]: `` You 're welcome , Pixie -- a hundred times welcome .
Parsing [sent. 729 len. 10]: We 're overjoyed to see you , dear . ''
Parsing [sent. 730 len. 26]: Pixie beamed at him , with an attention somewhat diverted by the two young men who stared at her from a few yards ' distance .
Parsing [sent. 731 len. 49]: One was tall and fair , the other dark and thick set , and when Esmeralda swept forward to make the formal introductions it appeared that the first rejoiced in the name of Stanor Vaughan , and the second in the much more ordinary one of Robert Carr .
Parsing [sent. 732 len. 49]: `` My sister Patricia , '' once more announced Mrs Hilliard , and though the young men ascribed Pixie 's blush to a becoming modesty , it arose in reality from annoyance at the sound of the high-sounding title which had been so persistently dropped all her life .
Parsing [sent. 733 len. 12]: Surely Esmeralda was not going to insist upon `` Patricia ! ''
Parsing [sent. 734 len. 47]: For a few moments everybody remained standing , the men relating their experiences of the afternoon , while Esmeralda waited for some further additions to the tea-table , and Pixie 's quick-seeing eyes roamed here and there gathering impressions to be stored away for later use .
Parsing [sent. 735 len. 52]: She was too excited , too interested , to talk herself , but her ears were as quick as her eyes , and so it happened that she caught a fragment of conversation between Miss Ward and the tall Mr Vaughan , which was certainly not intended for her ears . ''
Parsing [sent. 736 len. 7]: ... A _ sister _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 737 len. 9]: he was repeating in tones of incredulous astonishment .
Parsing [sent. 738 len. 4]: `` A sister !
Parsing [sent. 739 len. 5]: But how extraordinarily unlike !
Parsing [sent. 740 len. 17]: She must have thrown in her own beauty to add to Mrs Hilliard 's share ! ''
Parsing [sent. 741 len. 6]: `` Oh , hush ! ''
Parsing [sent. 742 len. 6]: breathed the girl urgently . ''
Parsing [sent. 743 len. 6]: _ She heard _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 744 len. 16]: Stanor Vaughan lifted his head sharply and met Pixie 's watching eyes fixed upon him .
Parsing [sent. 745 len. 20]: His own glance was tense and shamed , but to his amazement hers was friendly , humorous , undismayed .
Parsing [sent. 746 len. 27]: There was no displeasure in her face , no hint of humiliation nor discomfiture -- nothing , it would appear , but serene , unruffled agreement .
Parsing [sent. 747 len. 51]: Stanor Vaughan had not a good memory : few events of his youth remained with him after middle life , but when he was an old , old man that moment still remained vivid , when , in the place of rebuke , he first met the radiance of Pixie .
Parsing [sent. 748 len. 7]: O'Shaughnessy 's broad , sweet smile .
Parsing [sent. 749 len. 3]: CHAPTER SIX .
Parsing [sent. 750 len. 8]: A TALK ABOUT MEN -- AND PICKLES .
Parsing [sent. 751 len. 32]: Stanor Vaughan was deputed to take Pixie in to dinner that evening , an arrangement which at the beginning of the meal appeared less agreeable to him than to his partner .
Parsing [sent. 752 len. 42]: He cast furtive glances at the small , plain , yet mysteriously attractive little girl , who was the sister of the beautiful Mrs Hilliard , the while she ate her soup , and found himself attacked by an unusual nervousness .
Parsing [sent. 753 len. 17]: He did n't know what to say : he did n't know how to say it .
Parsing [sent. 754 len. 31]: He had made a bad start , and he wished with all his heart that he could change places with Carr and `` rot '' with that jolly Miss Ward .
Parsing [sent. 755 len. 25]: All the same , he found himself curiously attracted by this small Miss O'Shaughnessy , and he puzzled his handsome head to discover why .
Parsing [sent. 756 len. 37]: There was no beauty in the little face , and , as a rule , Stanor , as he himself would have expressed it , had `` no use '' for a girl who was plain .
Parsing [sent. 757 len. 45]: What really attracted him was the happiness and serenity which shone in Pixie 's face , as light shines through the encircling glass , for to human creatures as to plants the great necessity of life is sun , and its attraction is supreme .
Parsing [sent. 758 len. 73]: Walk along a crowded street and watch the different faces of the men and women as they pass by -- grey faces , drab faces , white faces , yellow faces , faces sad and cross , and lined and dull , faces by the thousand blank of any expression at all , and then here and there , at rare , rare intervals , a _ live _ face that speaks .
Parsing [sent. 759 len. 39]: You spy it afar off -- a face with shining eyes , with lips curled ready for laughter , with arching brows , and tilted chin , and every little line and wrinkle speaking of _ life _ .
Parsing [sent. 760 len. 43]: That face is as a magnet to attract not only eyes , but hearts into the bargain ; the passers-by , rouse themselves from their lethargy to smile back in sympathy , and pass on their way wafting mental messages of affection .
Parsing [sent. 761 len. 10]: -- `` What a _ dear _ girl ! ''
Parsing [sent. 762 len. 19]: they cry , or `` woman , '' or `` man , '' as the case may be .
Parsing [sent. 763 len. 6]: `` What a charming face !
Parsing [sent. 764 len. 9]: I should like to know that girl . ''
Parsing [sent. 765 len. 28]: And the girl with the happy face goes on _ her _ way , all the happier for the kindly , thoughts by which she is pursued .
Parsing [sent. 766 len. 62]: When strangers were first introduced to Pixie O'Shaughnessy they invariably catalogued her as a plain-looking girl ; when they had known her for an hour they began to feel that they had been mistaken , and at the end of a week they would have been prepared to quarrel with their best friend if he had echoed their own first judgment .
Parsing [sent. 767 len. 11]: The charm of her personality soon overpowered the physical deficiency .
Parsing [sent. 768 len. 19]: Stanor Vaughan was as yet too young and prosperous to realise the real reason of Pixie 's attraction .
Parsing [sent. 769 len. 24]: He decided that it was attributable to her trim , jaunty little figure and the unusual fashion in which she dressed her hair .
Parsing [sent. 770 len. 32]: Also she wore a shade of bright flame-coloured silk which made a special appeal to his artistic eye , and he approved of the simple , graceful fashion of its cut .
Parsing [sent. 771 len. 11]: `` Looks as if she 'd had enough stuff ! ''
Parsing [sent. 772 len. 16]: he said to himself , with all a man 's dislike of the prevailing hobble .
Parsing [sent. 773 len. 28]: He pondered how to open the conversation , asking himself uneasily what punishment the girl would award him for his _ faux pas _ of the afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 774 len. 5]: Would she be haughty ?
Parsing [sent. 775 len. 13]: She did n't look the kind of little thing to be haughty !
Parsing [sent. 776 len. 7]: Would she be cold and aloof ?
Parsing [sent. 777 len. 18]: Somehow , glancing at the irregular , piquant little profile , he could not imagine her aloof .
Parsing [sent. 778 len. 4]: Would she snap ?
Parsing [sent. 779 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 780 len. 7]: Now he was not so certain .
Parsing [sent. 781 len. 43]: He saw distinct possibilities of snap , and then , just as he determined that he really must make the plunge and get it over , Pixie leaned confidentially toward him and said below her breath -- '' _ Please _ talk !
Parsing [sent. 782 len. 13]: Make a start -- any start -- and I 'll go on .
Parsing [sent. 783 len. 9]: ... It 's your place to begin . ''
Parsing [sent. 784 len. 20]: `` Er -- er -- '' stammered Stanor , and promptly forgot every subject of conversation under the sun .
Parsing [sent. 785 len. 23]: He stared back into the girl 's face , met her honest eyes , and was seized with an impulse of confession .
Parsing [sent. 786 len. 17]: `` Before I say anything else , I -- I ought to apologise , Miss O'Shaughnessy .
Parsing [sent. 787 len. 6]: I 'm most abominably ashamed .
Parsing [sent. 788 len. 33]: I 'm afraid you overheard my -- er -- er -- w-what I said to Miss Ward at tea -- '' `` Of course I heard , '' said Pixie , staring .
Parsing [sent. 789 len. 6]: `` What could you expect ?
Parsing [sent. 790 len. 11]: Not four yards away , and a great bass voice !
Parsing [sent. 791 len. 7]: I 'm not _ deaf _ .
Parsing [sent. 792 len. 9]: But there 's no need to feel sorry .
Parsing [sent. 793 len. 11]: I thought you put it very nicely , myself ! ''
Parsing [sent. 794 len. 4]: `` Nicely ! ''
Parsing [sent. 795 len. 6]: He stared in amaze . ''
Parsing [sent. 796 len. 4]: _ Nicely _ !
Parsing [sent. 797 len. 16]: How could you possibly -- '' `` You said I had given Esmeralda my share .
Parsing [sent. 798 len. 17]: I 'd never once looked at it in that way ; neither had any one else .
Parsing [sent. 799 len. 8]: And it 's _ so soothing _ .
Parsing [sent. 800 len. 20]: It gives me a sort of credit , do n't you see , as well as a pride . ''
Parsing [sent. 801 len. 35]: She was speaking honestly , transparently honestly ; it was impossible to doubt that , with her clear eyes beaming upon him , her lips curling back in laughter from her small white teeth .
Parsing [sent. 802 len. 20]: There was not one sign of rancour , of offence , of natural girlish vanity suffering beneath a blow .
Parsing [sent. 803 len. 5]: `` Good sport ! ''
Parsing [sent. 804 len. 19]: cried Stanor , in a voice , however , which could be heard by no one but himself .
Parsing [sent. 805 len. 23]: His embarrassment fell from him , but not his amazement ; _ that _ seemed to increase with each moment that passed .
Parsing [sent. 806 len. 24]: His glance lingered on Pixie 's face , the while he said incredulously -- `` It 's -- it 's wonderful of you .
Parsing [sent. 807 len. 18]: I 've known heaps of girls , but never one who would have taken it like that .
Parsing [sent. 808 len. 21]: You do n't seem to have a scrap of conceit -- '' `` Ex-cuse me , '' corrected Miss O'Shaughnessy .
Parsing [sent. 809 len. 37]: For the first time she seemed to be slightly ruffled , as though the supposition that she could be bereft of any quality , or experience common to her kind was distinctly hurtful to her pride .
Parsing [sent. 810 len. 6]: `` I _ have _ !
Parsing [sent. 811 len. 2]: Heaps !
Parsing [sent. 812 len. 8]: But it 's for the right things .
Parsing [sent. 813 len. 22]: I 've too much conceit to be conceited about things about which I 've no _ right _ to be conceited .
Parsing [sent. 814 len. 37]: I 'm only conceited about things about which I 'm -- '' `` Conceited enough to know are worth being jolly well conceited about , '' concluded Stanor , and they laughed together in merry understanding .
Parsing [sent. 815 len. 11]: `` That 's it , '' agreed Pixie , nodding .
Parsing [sent. 816 len. 52]: `` I used to be conceited about being plain , because it was so unusual in our family that it was considered quite distinguished , and my father used to boast at the hunt that he had the ugliest child in the county , though it was himself that said it .
Parsing [sent. 817 len. 20]: But , '' she gave the slightest , most ephemeral of sighs , `` I 've lived through that .
Parsing [sent. 818 len. 10]: I 'm conceited now about -- other things . ''
Parsing [sent. 819 len. 9]: `` Lots of them , I 'm sure .
Parsing [sent. 820 len. 20]: There must be lots , '' agreed Stanor , with a sincerity which condoned the banality of the speech .
Parsing [sent. 821 len. 38]: `` About your good nature for one thing , I should say , and your generosity in forgiving a blundering man , and your jolly disposition which makes you smile when another girl would have been wild .
Parsing [sent. 822 len. 34]: I can understand all those and a lot more , but , just as a matter of curiosity , I should like to know what are you conceited about _ most _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 823 len. 4]: Pixie O'Shaughnessy smiled .
Parsing [sent. 824 len. 14]: There was evidently no doubt in her own mind as to her reply .
Parsing [sent. 825 len. 12]: The slim figure straightened , the little head tilted in air .
Parsing [sent. 826 len. 18]: Quick and crisp came the reply -- `` I can make people do what I like ! ''
Parsing [sent. 827 len. 7]: `` Can you , though ! ''
Parsing [sent. 828 len. 4]: exclaimed Stanor blankly .
Parsing [sent. 829 len. 37]: The statement seemed to threaten a mysteriously personal application , and he relapsed into a ruminating silence , the while his companion employed herself cheerfully with her dinner and the looks and conversation of her companions .
Parsing [sent. 830 len. 29]: It was one of Pixie 's special gifts to be able to do at least three things at the same time with quite a fair amount of success .
Parsing [sent. 831 len. 33]: She could , for instance , write a business-like letter while carrying on an animated conversation with a friend , and keeping an eye on a small child tottering around the room .
Parsing [sent. 832 len. 28]: Brain , eyes , and limb were alike so alert that what to slower natures would have been impossible , to her involved no effort at all .
Parsing [sent. 833 len. 24]: Therefore , when about two minutes later Stanor opened his lips again to utter a short , urgent '' _ How _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 834 len. 69]: she had not the slightest difficulty in switching back to the subject , though she had been at the moment in the midst of an absorbing calculation as to the number of yards of lace on a dress of a lady farther down the table , and in drawing mental designs of the way it was put on , to enclose to Bridgie in her next letter home .
Parsing [sent. 835 len. 4]: `` How ? ''
Parsing [sent. 836 len. 12]: `` I _ understand _ them , '' said Pixie deeply .
Parsing [sent. 837 len. 23]: `` You can open any door if you have the key , but most people go on banging when it 's shut .
Parsing [sent. 838 len. 26]: I wait till I find my key , and then I keep it ready until the moment arrives when I wish to get in . ''
Parsing [sent. 839 len. 18]: Stanor 's broad shoulders gave an involuntary movement which might almost have been taken for a shiver .
Parsing [sent. 840 len. 12]: Once again he felt a mysterious conviction of a personal application .
Parsing [sent. 841 len. 20]: All his life long the phrase had rung in his ears , `` I do n't understand you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 842 len. 9]: `` If I could once understand you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 843 len. 19]: and for lack of that understanding there had been trouble and coldness between himself and his nearest relative .
Parsing [sent. 844 len. 16]: Proverbially he was difficult to understand ; and he had prided himself on the reputation .
Parsing [sent. 845 len. 16]: Who wanted to be a simple , transparent fellow , whom any one could lead ?
Parsing [sent. 846 len. 27]: This was the first time in his life that he had come into contact with a girl who announced herself an expert understander of human nature .
Parsing [sent. 847 len. 36]: He wondered vaguely what , given the initial success , Pixie would wish him to do , hesitated on the point of inquiry , thought better of it and turned the conversation to impersonal topics .
Parsing [sent. 848 len. 22]: After dinner Pixie sat on a sofa in the drawing-room enjoying a temporary _ tete-a-tete _ with the other girl visitor .
Parsing [sent. 849 len. 44]: Miss Ward 's hair was , if possible , smoother than ever , and she wore a velvet dress almost exactly matching it in shade , which seemed to Pixie 's unsophisticated eyes an extraordinarily sumptuous garment for a young girl to wear .
Parsing [sent. 850 len. 17]: Her eyes were brown , too -- bright , quick-glancing eyes full of interest and curiosity .
Parsing [sent. 851 len. 10]: When she spoke her nationality became once more conspicuous .
Parsing [sent. 852 len. 18]: `` Miss Pat-ricia O'Shaughnessy , I guess you and I have got to be real good friends !
Parsing [sent. 853 len. 14]: I 've been spoiling for another girl to enjoy this trip with me .
Parsing [sent. 854 len. 31]: If you 're having a good time , it makes it twice as good to have a girl to go shares , and compare notes , and share the jokes .
Parsing [sent. 855 len. 13]: You look to me as if you could enjoy a joke . ''
Parsing [sent. 856 len. 12]: `` I was brought up to them , '' Pixie affirmed .
Parsing [sent. 857 len. 7]: `` I could n't live without .
Parsing [sent. 858 len. 37]: There 's nothing to eat , nor to drink , nor to do , nor to have that I could n't give up at a pinch , but a sense of humour I -- must have !
Parsing [sent. 859 len. 13]: If you feel the same , we 're friends from this minute .
Parsing [sent. 860 len. 16]: ... Would you mind telling me as a start just exactly who you are ? ''
Parsing [sent. 861 len. 6]: Miss Ward 's face fell .
Parsing [sent. 862 len. 8]: Her white brows knitted in a frown .
Parsing [sent. 863 len. 10]: `` I 'm an Amurrican , '' she announced .
Parsing [sent. 864 len. 29]: `` Mr and Mrs Hilliard had an introduction to my people when they visited the States , and when I came over to Europe they invited me here .
Parsing [sent. 865 len. 15]: I 'm proud to death of being an Amurrican ; that 's of course !
Parsing [sent. 866 len. 6]: But there 's something else .
Parsing [sent. 867 len. 11]: You might as well know it first as last . ''
Parsing [sent. 868 len. 9]: She straightened herself and drew a fluttering breath .
Parsing [sent. 869 len. 6]: `` I 'm in trade !
Parsing [sent. 870 len. 9]: I 'm Ward 's Unrivalled Piquant Pickles ! ''
Parsing [sent. 871 len. 4]: `` Wh-what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 872 len. 23]: Pixie stammered in confusion , as well she might , for the announcement was unusual , to say the least of it .
Parsing [sent. 873 len. 3]: `` Pickles !
Parsing [sent. 874 len. 21]: Cauliflower , and cabbage , and little snippets of vegetables floating in piquant sauce , in fat , square bottles .
Parsing [sent. 875 len. 7]: I make them in my factory .
Parsing [sent. 876 len. 48]: If you went over to the States you 'd see my placards on every wall , and inside magazines , and on the back sheets of newspapers -- a big , fat man eating a plate of cold meat with Ward 's unrivalled piquants by his side .
Parsing [sent. 877 len. 13]: They used to be my father 's : now they 're mine .
Parsing [sent. 878 len. 9]: _ I _ am the Unrivalled Piquant Pickles .
Parsing [sent. 879 len. 5]: I run the factory .
Parsing [sent. 880 len. 8]: The profits grow more e-normous every year .
Parsing [sent. 881 len. 12]: There 's no other partners in it , only Me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 882 len. 33]: If at the beginning of her speech the speaker had made an affectation of humility , she certainly ended on a note of pride , and Pixie 's admiration was transparently evident .
Parsing [sent. 883 len. 6]: `` Think of that now !
Parsing [sent. 884 len. 9]: A whole factory , and pickles , too !
Parsing [sent. 885 len. 11]: I adore pickles , especially the fat , cauliflowery bits .
Parsing [sent. 886 len. 11]: And to see one 's own name on the hoardings !
Parsing [sent. 887 len. 7]: I 'd be so proud ! ''
Parsing [sent. 888 len. 7]: `` Honest Injun , you would ?
Parsing [sent. 889 len. 33]: You do n't feel proud and lofty because I 'm in trade , and had a grandfather who could n't read , while _ your _ ancestors have been grandees for centuries ?
Parsing [sent. 890 len. 10]: Many English people _ do _ , you know .
Parsing [sent. 891 len. 22]: They have a way of looking at me as if I were a hundred miles away , and stunted at that .
Parsing [sent. 892 len. 23]: And others who _ do _ receive me do n't trouble to hide that it 's for the sake of the dollars .
Parsing [sent. 893 len. 25]: A girl likes to be cared for for _ herself _ : she wants people should judge her by what she _ is _ .
Parsing [sent. 894 len. 14]: It 's a big handicap , Pat-ricia , to be too rich . ''
Parsing [sent. 895 len. 30]: `` I 'll take your word for it , me dear , having no experience , '' said Pixie graciously ; `` but I 'd like to be tried .
Parsing [sent. 896 len. 10]: As for caring -- no one could help it .
Parsing [sent. 897 len. 42]: I do already , and I 've only known you three hours , and Esmeralda said you were nice enough to be Irish , and it is n't the easiest thing in the world to please _ her _ fancy . ''
Parsing [sent. 898 len. 7]: `` She 's a beautiful princess .
Parsing [sent. 899 len. 10]: She 's been real sweet to me over here .
Parsing [sent. 900 len. 7]: I 'm crazy about her ! ''
Parsing [sent. 901 len. 17]: Honor affirmed in the slow , dragging voice which went so quaintly with her exaggerated language .
Parsing [sent. 902 len. 11]: `` But one Mrs Hilliard do n't make a world .
Parsing [sent. 903 len. 45]: You 've got to be just as good to me as you know how , Pat-ricia , for I 've got no one belonging to me on this side nearer than an elderly cousin , twice removed , and it 's a lonesome feeling .
Parsing [sent. 904 len. 41]: `` You see , it is n't only what people think of _ me _ , it 's the mean , suspicious feelings I 've gotten towards _ them _ , as the result of being brought up an heiress .
Parsing [sent. 905 len. 10]: If I could tell you all I 've endoored !
Parsing [sent. 906 len. 7]: The things I 've been told !
Parsing [sent. 907 len. 6]: The things I 've overheard !
Parsing [sent. 908 len. 20]: Twenty-three men have asked me to marry them , and there was n't an honest heart among the crowd .
Parsing [sent. 909 len. 48]: I 'm not a new-fashioned girl : I 'm made so 's I 'd love my own home ; but sure as fate I 'll die an old maid , for _ I _ run away from fortune-hunters , and the honest men run away from me .
Parsing [sent. 910 len. 39]: If a man happened to be poor and proud , it would be a pretty stiff undertaking to propose to the biggest pickle factory in the world , and I guess I do n't make it any easier .
Parsing [sent. 911 len. 68]: You see it 's like this : the more I 'm anxious that -- that , er -- er , '' she stammered uncertainly for a moment , then with forcible emphasis brought out a plural pronoun , '' _ they _ should care for me really and truly for _ myself _ , the more I think that they only think -- '' `` Exactly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 912 len. 5]: interrupted Pixie , nodding .
Parsing [sent. 913 len. 6]: `` I quite understand . ''
Parsing [sent. 914 len. 28]: And indeed she looked so exceedingly alert and understanding that Honor flushed all over her small , pale face , and made haste to change the conversation .
Parsing [sent. 915 len. 12]: `` How did you get on with your partner at dinner ?
Parsing [sent. 916 len. 5]: Pretty well , eh ?
Parsing [sent. 917 len. 22]: He can be real charming when he likes , and there 's no doubt but he 's good to look at .
Parsing [sent. 918 len. 28]: I 've met him quite a good deal since I 've been over here , for he 's been staying at several houses at the same time .
Parsing [sent. 919 len. 45]: From a European point of view , we seem quite old friends , and I 've a kind of fellow-feeling for him , poor boy , for he 's a sufferer from my complaint of being too well off for his own good . ''
Parsing [sent. 920 len. 16]: Pixie nodded several times without speaking , her lips pursed in knowing , elderly fashion .
Parsing [sent. 921 len. 27]: `` That accounts for it , '' she said , and when Honor queried eagerly as to her meaning , her reply had a blighting insinuation .
Parsing [sent. 922 len. 13]: `` I 'm accustomed to soldiers -- men who can fight . ''
Parsing [sent. 923 len. 7]: `` That 's not fair ! ''
Parsing [sent. 924 len. 4]: cried Honor sharply .
Parsing [sent. 925 len. 12]: She straightened herself and tilted her head at an aggressive angle .
Parsing [sent. 926 len. 6]: `` That 's not fair .
Parsing [sent. 927 len. 29]: I guess Stanor Vaughan and I have to go through our own military training , and it 's a heap more complicated than marching round a barrack yard !
Parsing [sent. 928 len. 31]: We 're bound to make our own weapons , and our enemies are the worst that 's made -- the sort that comes skulking along in the guise of friends .
Parsing [sent. 929 len. 32]: There are n't any bands playing , either , to cheer us along , and when we win there are no medals and honours , only maybe an aching heart ! ''
Parsing [sent. 930 len. 10]: She drew herself up with a startled little laugh .
Parsing [sent. 931 len. 3]: `` Mussy !
Parsing [sent. 932 len. 5]: Listen to me sermonising .
Parsing [sent. 933 len. 17]: -- I guess I 'd better get back to facts as fast as I know how .
Parsing [sent. 934 len. 29]: ... When I said Stanor was _ too _ well off , I did n't mean money exactly , but things are too easy for him all round .
Parsing [sent. 935 len. 45]: He 's handsome , and strong , and clever , and charming , and there 's an uncle in the background who plays fairy godfather and plans out his life ahead , so that he has nothing to worry about like other young men .
Parsing [sent. 936 len. 38]: He 's not an old uncle really : he 's almost young , but he had an accident as a boy which laid him up for quite a spell , and turned him into a shy recluse .
Parsing [sent. 937 len. 37]: Then when at last he recovered , he was lame , so of course he was cut off from active life , and I guess from what I 've heard that he 's sensitive about it .
Parsing [sent. 938 len. 41]: Anyway , he lives all alone , and has adopted Stanor as a kind of son , and fusses over him like a hen with one chick -- a bit more than the young man appreciates , I fancy . ''
Parsing [sent. 939 len. 4]: `` How fuss ?
Parsing [sent. 940 len. 5]: In what way ? ''
Parsing [sent. 941 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 942 len. 13]: Ambitious , do n't you know , '' Miss Ward explained vaguely .
Parsing [sent. 943 len. 27]: `` All the things he ever wanted to be and to do , and could n't , he is determined that Stanor shall do for him .
Parsing [sent. 944 len. 50]: He is clever , and studious , and serious , so he is set on it that the poor boy should be a book-worm , too , and put study before everything else , and have serious ideas on -- er -- er -- the responsibility of property . ''
Parsing [sent. 945 len. 11]: Honor frowned at the tips of her small satin shoes .
Parsing [sent. 946 len. 14]: `` Drains , you know , and cottages , and overcrowding the poor .
Parsing [sent. 947 len. 29]: Of course that kind of thing comes easy enough when you are thirty-five and lame , but poor Stanor is only twenty-four , and as handsome as paint .
Parsing [sent. 948 len. 17]: It 's difficult to be serious-minded at twenty-four , and patient with people who fuss ! ''
Parsing [sent. 949 len. 10]: Pixie knitted her brows with an air of perturbation .
Parsing [sent. 950 len. 11]: `` But I hope he is nice to his uncle .
Parsing [sent. 951 len. 21]: It would be so hard to be hurt in your body and hurt in your mind at the same time .
Parsing [sent. 952 len. 22]: It 's bad enough for him , poor creature , to have to sit still and live his life through another .
Parsing [sent. 953 len. 68]: His heart is not crippled , nor his mind , nor his will , and fancy , me dear , going on being patient , day after day , year after year , while your body held you back , and you longed , and could n't , and felt the spirit to move a mountain , and were obliged to lie still on a sofa ! ''
Parsing [sent. 954 len. 21]: Pixie bounced in a characteristic fashion on her own sofa corner , and whisked a minute pocket-handkerchief to her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 955 len. 13]: `` Excuse me , me dear , will you change the conversation ?
Parsing [sent. 956 len. 20]: I was always soft-hearted , but red eyes at a dinner party are not _ a la mode _ .
Parsing [sent. 957 len. 7]: ... Let 's talk about pickles !
Parsing [sent. 958 len. 5]: -- '' CHAPTER SEVEN .
Parsing [sent. 959 len. 4]: PIXIE IS DULL .
Parsing [sent. 960 len. 22]: Geoffrey Hilliard and his two guests entered the drawing-room , and Pixie 's eyes turned to greet them with a smile .
Parsing [sent. 961 len. 27]: She was longing to talk to each one of them in turns , and with her usual complacency was assured that each would reciprocate the wish .
Parsing [sent. 962 len. 46]: But the next moment brought with it a jar , for Geoffrey crossed the room to join his wife , and the two younger men made a bee-line for the chair by the _ other _ side of the sofa , whereon Honor sat ensconced !
Parsing [sent. 963 len. 53]: It was only a minute , less than a minute , before Stanor had established a lead , and Mr Carr 's deviation to the left was a triumph of smiling composure ; nevertheless , Pixie 's sharp eyes had seen and understood , and her heart felt a natural girlish pang .
Parsing [sent. 964 len. 28]: At twenty it is hard to accept with resignation the part of second fiddle , and Pixie 's generosity had its limits -- as whose has not ?
Parsing [sent. 965 len. 44]: She had looked at Honor 's pretty face and costly gown , had heard of her wealth and independence with the purest and most ungrudging pleasure , but when it became a case of superior popularity , that was a very different matter !
Parsing [sent. 966 len. 33]: Positively , it was quite an effort to twist her lips into a smile to greet Mr Carr , and it made matters no better to perceive the artificiality of his response .
Parsing [sent. 967 len. 35]: He was a man several years older than the handsome Stanor , and his type of face was so essentially legal that his profession as barrister could be guessed even before it was known .
Parsing [sent. 968 len. 25]: His chin was the most pronounced feature of the face -- it was really interesting to discover just how assertive a chin could be .
Parsing [sent. 969 len. 28]: It was a prominent , deeply indented specimen , which ascribed to itself so much power of expression that even the eyes themselves played a secondary part .
Parsing [sent. 970 len. 34]: The tilt of it , the droop of it , the aggressive tilt forward were each equally eloquent , and , one felt sure , must make equal appeal to a British jury .
Parsing [sent. 971 len. 48]: At this moment , however , there was no jury at hand -- only Pixie O'Shaughnessy , feeling very small and snubbed in her corner of the sofa , and robbed for the moment of her accustomed aplomb by the blighting consciousness that she was not wanted .
Parsing [sent. 972 len. 54]: Robert Carr 's chin was leaning very dejectedly forward ; he would have voted his companion a tongue-tied little bore if Stanor Vaughan had not taken the opportunity of a moment when his host was absent from the dining-room to recount her `` sporting '' forgiveness of his own _ faux pas _ .
Parsing [sent. 973 len. 7]: `` That 's the right sort .
Parsing [sent. 974 len. 6]: I like that girl ! ''
Parsing [sent. 975 len. 21]: had been Robert 's reply , and the good impression was strong enough to withstand a fair amount of discouragement .
Parsing [sent. 976 len. 76]: So he discoursed to Pixie on the subject of pictures , of which she knew nothing ; and she switched the conversation round to music , of which he knew less ; and she cast furtive glances of longing towards the other couple , who were laughing and chattering together with every appearance of enjoyment , and he kept his eyes rigorously averted , while his chin drooped ever lower and lower in growing depression .
Parsing [sent. 977 len. 40]: Later on the whole party played several rather foolish games , of which Pixie had never heard before , and in which she consequently did not shine , which was still another depressing circumstance to add to the list .
Parsing [sent. 978 len. 21]: When Esmeralda escorted her sister upstairs to bed she said blightingly , `` You were very dull to-night , Pixie .
Parsing [sent. 979 len. 8]: Were you shy , by any chance ?
Parsing [sent. 980 len. 15]: _ Please _ do n't be shy ; it 's such poor form ! ''
Parsing [sent. 981 len. 27]: which was not the most soothing night-cap in the world for a young woman who had privately made up her mind to take society by storm .
Parsing [sent. 982 len. 39]: Not since the first night in the dormitory at Holly House had Pixie felt so lone and lorn as she did when the door was shut , and she was left alone in the big , luxurious bedroom .
Parsing [sent. 983 len. 31]: She stood before a swing mirror , gazing at her own reflection , contrasting it with those of Esmeralda and Honor , and reflecting on her sister 's parting words .
Parsing [sent. 984 len. 27]: `` This , '' said she to herself , with melancholy resignation -- `` this is the sort of discipline that is good for the young !
Parsing [sent. 985 len. 20]: At this rate I 'll grow so chastened that they wo n't recognise me when I go home . ''
Parsing [sent. 986 len. 36]: For a whole , minute she stood mute and motionless , pondering over the prospect ; then the light danced back into her eyes , she shrugged her shoulders , and composedly began her undressing .
Parsing [sent. 987 len. 59]: The next day broke bright and warm , and after a leisurely breakfast the four visitors strolled about for an hour , looking at the dogs and horses and playing with the two small boys , who were making all the mischief they could on the cedar lawn , while their French nurse looked on with sympathetic enjoyment .
Parsing [sent. 988 len. 24]: Marie was quite a character in the household , and was admitted to a degree of intimacy rarely accorded to an English domestic .
Parsing [sent. 989 len. 28]: She was that somewhat unusual combination , a Parisian Protestant , but in other respects remained one of the most typically French creatures who was ever born .
Parsing [sent. 990 len. 31]: Meet her in any quarter of the world , in any nation , in any garb , and for no fraction of a moment could the beholder doubt her nationality .
Parsing [sent. 991 len. 52]: She was French in appearance , in expression , in movement , in thought , in character , and in deed ; lovable , intelligent , vivacious , easily irritated , but still more easily pleased , sharp of tongue , tender of heart , and full to overflowing with humour .
Parsing [sent. 992 len. 27]: In appearance Marie was small and slight , with a sallow complexion which was the bane of her life , black hair and beautiful white teeth .
Parsing [sent. 993 len. 17]: No one could call her handsome , but she had certainly an attraction of her own .
Parsing [sent. 994 len. 22]: This morning Pixie arrived upon the scene in time to overhear a typical conversation between the nurse and her two charges .
Parsing [sent. 995 len. 42]: Geoff , the elder of the two brothers , a handsome , imperious youngster , having overheard a chance remark as to his own likeness to his mother , was engaged in a rigorous cross-questioning of Marie , on the subject .
Parsing [sent. 996 len. 8]: `` Marie , am I beautiful ? ''
Parsing [sent. 997 len. 7]: `` Leetle boys are not beautiful .
Parsing [sent. 998 len. 9]: It is enough when they are good . ''
Parsing [sent. 999 len. 6]: `` My mother is beautiful .
Parsing [sent. 1000 len. 10]: Mr Carr says I am like my mother . ''
Parsing [sent. 1001 len. 9]: `` Ugly people can be like beautiful people .
Parsing [sent. 1002 len. 15]: How can a dirty little boy be like a _ belle grande dame _ ?
Parsing [sent. 1003 len. 4]: Regard thy hands !
Parsing [sent. 1004 len. 9]: Four times already have they been scrubbed . ''
Parsing [sent. 1005 len. 10]: `` My hands can be clean when I like .
Parsing [sent. 1006 len. 10]: I was talking of if I was beautiful . ''
Parsing [sent. 1007 len. 6]: `` Silence , miserable one !
Parsing [sent. 1008 len. 12]: The appearance is of no account , '' pronounced Marie boldly .
Parsing [sent. 1009 len. 10]: `` To be good is better than beauty . ''
Parsing [sent. 1010 len. 9]: Geoffrey drew his brows together in a frown .
Parsing [sent. 1011 len. 14]: He was displeased , and when he was displeased he made himself felt .
Parsing [sent. 1012 len. 26]: `` I should fink , Marie , '' he said deliberately , `` that you must be the goodest person in all the world . ''
Parsing [sent. 1013 len. 20]: The inference was plain , so plain that sensitive little Jack coloured up to the roots of his hair .
Parsing [sent. 1014 len. 25]: Jack was the sweetest and most lovable of children -- a flaxen-haired cherub , whose winning face and gentle ways made him universally beloved .
Parsing [sent. 1015 len. 29]: Among the children of the second generation he stood out pre-eminently , and every one of his aunts and uncles enshrined him in a special niche of affection .
Parsing [sent. 1016 len. 40]: Pixie had known many searchings of heart because of her own partiality , but was fain to console herself by the thought that Jack was even more like the beloved Bridgie than Bridgie 's own sturdy , commonplace son .
Parsing [sent. 1017 len. 25]: As for Jack , he loved everybody , Marie among the number , and , feeling her depreciated , rushed stutteringly to the rescue .
Parsing [sent. 1018 len. 6]: `` Oh , Geoff ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1019 len. 4]: he cried eagerly .
Parsing [sent. 1020 len. 5]: `` You sould n't !
Parsing [sent. 1021 len. 6]: You sould n't , Geoff !
Parsing [sent. 1022 len. 15]: I know somefing that 's uglier than Marie -- '' Geoff 's scowl deepened .
Parsing [sent. 1023 len. 14]: He might insinuate , but a barefaced putting into words outraged his feelings .
Parsing [sent. 1024 len. 28]: His eyes sent out flashes of lightning at the innocent little blunderer , but Marie 's eyes shone ; her face was one beam of tender amusement .
Parsing [sent. 1025 len. 8]: `` What then , _ cherie _ ?
Parsing [sent. 1026 len. 5]: Tell thy Marie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1027 len. 4]: `` M-monkeys ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1028 len. 3]: lisped Jack .
Parsing [sent. 1029 len. 34]: The roar of derision which greeted this consolatory statement brought the startled tears into Jack 's eyes , but Marie 's arms wrapped round him , and her voice cooed in his ear .
Parsing [sent. 1030 len. 4]: `` Little pigeon !
Parsing [sent. 1031 len. 3]: little cabbage !
Parsing [sent. 1032 len. 6]: Weep not , my darling !
Parsing [sent. 1033 len. 5]: Marie does not laugh .
Parsing [sent. 1034 len. 3]: Marie understands .
Parsing [sent. 1035 len. 4]: It is true !
Parsing [sent. 1036 len. 27]: The monkeys are more ugly than I. '' Pixie turned , to find Esmeralda standing beside her , her brows frowning , while her lips smiled .
Parsing [sent. 1037 len. 14]: She put her hand through her sister 's arm and drew her away .
Parsing [sent. 1038 len. 10]: `` Leave them alone ; Marie manages them best .
Parsing [sent. 1039 len. 5]: Poor , weeny Jack !
Parsing [sent. 1040 len. 6]: He meant so well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1041 len. 6]: She drew a long sigh .
Parsing [sent. 1042 len. 13]: `` Those two boys are just a newer edition of their parents .
Parsing [sent. 1043 len. 22]: Little Jack is Geoffrey over again -- just the same kind , patient , sensitive disposition ; and Geoff is me .
Parsing [sent. 1044 len. 19]: When he is in one of his moods it 's like looking at myself in a mental glass .
Parsing [sent. 1045 len. 35]: I 'm furious with him for showing me how hateful I can be , and at the same time I understand what he is feeling so well that my heart nearly breaks with sympathy .
Parsing [sent. 1046 len. 39]: It 's terrible to feel that one is showing a bad example to one 's own child , when one cares so much that at any moment one would be willingly flayed alive to do him good ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1047 len. 15]: `` Improve your example , me dear -- would n't that be simpler ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1048 len. 22]: cried Pixie , with an air of breezy common sense which was in startling contrast to the other 's tragic fervour .
Parsing [sent. 1049 len. 46]: There was a time for everything , Pixie reflected , and it did _ not _ seem a judicious moment for a hostess to indulge in heroics , what time the members of her house-party were advancing to meet her with faces wreathed in expectancy .
Parsing [sent. 1050 len. 34]: They made a goodly picture in the spring sunshine -- the little trim girl and the two tall men attired in the easy country kit which is so becoming to the Anglo-Saxon type .
Parsing [sent. 1051 len. 13]: The young hostess looked at them and gave a start of recollection .
Parsing [sent. 1052 len. 6]: `` Oh , of course !
Parsing [sent. 1053 len. 4]: I was forgetting .
Parsing [sent. 1054 len. 8]: ... We have been arranging a picnic .
Parsing [sent. 1055 len. 9]: Geoff has ordered the big car for eleven .
Parsing [sent. 1056 len. 15]: He is to drive us a twenty-mile spin to the beginning of Frame Woods .
Parsing [sent. 1057 len. 32]: The chauffeur will go on by train and meet us there , to take the car round by the high-road and meet us a few miles farther on with the hampers .
Parsing [sent. 1058 len. 27]: The woods are carpeted with primroses just now , so we shall enjoy the walk , and it will give us an appetite for lunch . ''
Parsing [sent. 1059 len. 8]: Pixie gave a little prance of jubilation .
Parsing [sent. 1060 len. 3]: `` Lovely !
Parsing [sent. 1061 len. 2]: Lovely !
Parsing [sent. 1062 len. 4]: I adore picnics !
Parsing [sent. 1063 len. 32]: We 'll gather , sticks to boil a kettle , to make tea , and boil eggs , like we used to do at home when any one had a birthday .
Parsing [sent. 1064 len. 14]: And the sticks always fell in , and the water got smoked ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1065 len. 20]: Honor and the two men had joined the sisters by this time , and stood looking on with amusement .
Parsing [sent. 1066 len. 20]: `` Miss O'Shaughnessy seems to appreciate smoked tea , '' said Stanor , and Pixie sturdily defended her position .
Parsing [sent. 1067 len. 9]: `` I do n't ; it 's hateful !
Parsing [sent. 1068 len. 25]: But you can have _ nice _ tea every day , of your life , and the game _ is _ worth the candle !
Parsing [sent. 1069 len. 79]: You can always pour it away and drink milk , and you 've had all the fun -- gathering the wood , and stoking , and looking at the smoke , and the blaze , and hearing the crackle , and smelling the dear , _ woody _ smell -- '' `` And blacking your hands , and spoiling your temper , and waiting for -- how many hours does it take for a watched kettle to boil ?
Parsing [sent. 1070 len. 10]: -- and in the end throwing away the result !
Parsing [sent. 1071 len. 9]: You 're easily pleased , Miss O'Shaughnessy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1072 len. 10]: `` I _ am _ , praise be ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1073 len. 22]: assented Pixie , with a fervour which brought four pairs of eyes upon her with a mingling of interest and admiration .
Parsing [sent. 1074 len. 48]: So far as features were concerned , it was a plain little face on which they gazed ; yet no one could have called it plain at that moment , for , it was irradiated by that rarest of all beauties , an expression of radiant contentment .
Parsing [sent. 1075 len. 58]: In comparison with that face those of the beholders appeared tired and discouraged , old before their time , by reason of drooping lips , puckered brows , and wrinkled foreheads ; and it was evident that they themselves were aware of the fact , and stood , as it were , as amateurs before a master .
Parsing [sent. 1076 len. 15]: Robert Carr poked forward his chin , and stared at her between narrowed eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1077 len. 37]: Handsome Stanor smiled approval , Honor slipped a little hand through her arm , and Esmeralda sighed and frowned , and said with a shrug -- `` Oh , we 've lived past that , Pixie !
Parsing [sent. 1078 len. 26]: Nowadays we take thermos bottles , and luncheon baskets , and hot-water dishes , and dine just as -- uninterestingly as we do at home !
Parsing [sent. 1079 len. 10]: English people would n't thank you for a scramble .
Parsing [sent. 1080 len. 22]: You must wait until you go back to Knock to Jack and Sylvia , and even there the infection is creeping .
Parsing [sent. 1081 len. 10]: Jack is developing quite a taste for luxury . ''
Parsing [sent. 1082 len. 6]: `` I like it myself .
Parsing [sent. 1083 len. 12]: Dear Mrs Hilliard , please let us have luxuries to-day ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1084 len. 25]: Stanor pleaded ; and Joan turned back to the house to superintend arrangements , while the four young people sauntered slowly about the grounds .
Parsing [sent. 1085 len. 38]: Honor 's hand still rested on Pixie 's arm , and her voice had a wistful tone as she said -- `` I 'd like to fix a picnic _ your _ way some time , Pat-ricia !
Parsing [sent. 1086 len. 8]: It would be a heap more fun .
Parsing [sent. 1087 len. 14]: It must be fine to be a large family and make believe together .
Parsing [sent. 1088 len. 15]: It 's a problem for an only child to make mischief all by itself .
Parsing [sent. 1089 len. 17]: ... Did you have real good times in that old castle with the funny name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1090 len. 5]: `` We did ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1091 len. 4]: affirmed Pixie eloquently .
Parsing [sent. 1092 len. 45]: `` There were so many of us , and so little to go round , that we were kept busy contriving and scheming the whole time , and , when _ that _ failed , falling back on imagination to fill in the gaps .
Parsing [sent. 1093 len. 16]: It 's more comfortable to be rich , but it 's not half so exciting .
Parsing [sent. 1094 len. 26]: When you have very few things , and wait an age for them , it 's thrilling beyond words when they _ do _ arrive .
Parsing [sent. 1095 len. 35]: When Bridgie re-covered the cushions in the drawing-room we all came to call in a string , and sat about on chairs , discussing the weather and studying the colour effects from different angles .
Parsing [sent. 1096 len. 13]: Then we turned on the light and pretended to be a party .
Parsing [sent. 1097 len. 11]: I suppose Esmeralda never _ notices _ a cushion ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1098 len. 25]: Pixie sighed , and Honor stared , and Robert Carr looked from one to the other , his thin lips twitching in sarcastic fashion .
Parsing [sent. 1099 len. 3]: CHAPTER EIGHT .
Parsing [sent. 1100 len. 6]: A LONG , LONG LETTER .
Parsing [sent. 1101 len. 37]: From Pixie O'Shaughnessy to Bridgie Victor : `` Not a moment have I had to write to you , Honey , since the first wee note , and I 've been here a whole three days .
Parsing [sent. 1102 len. 26]: It 's the most distracting thing in the world when you 've nothing to do , and takes up more time than you 'd believe .
Parsing [sent. 1103 len. 69]: I think of you all in the morning in the dear little house , every one bustling round , and only longing for more hands and legs to get along the quicker , while here we sit , the six of us , dawdling over breakfast , with not a thing to think of but how to waste the time until we can decently begin to eat again !
Parsing [sent. 1104 len. 56]: It is n't energetic , and it is n't useful , and it is n't wise , or noble , or improving , or anything of the kind , but I wo n't disguise from you , my dear , that , by way of a change , it 's exceedingly agreeable to the feelings .
Parsing [sent. 1105 len. 48]: `` In Esmeralda 's language , there is no one here at present , which means that there are three other visitors besides my important self , and , what is more , my dear , there 's a full-fledged romance being acted under my very eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1106 len. 4]: Here 's luck !
Parsing [sent. 1107 len. 12]: Are n't things kind to happen so conveniently for me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1108 len. 4]: _ Heroine _ .
Parsing [sent. 1109 len. 6]: Honor Ward , aged twenty-four .
Parsing [sent. 1110 len. 2]: Orphan .
Parsing [sent. 1111 len. 12]: Proprietress of Piquant Pickles Factory , Cheeving , Massachusetts , USA .
Parsing [sent. 1112 len. 22]: Honor , who is of fair and pleasing exterior , is spending a year in Europe visiting various friends and connections .
Parsing [sent. 1113 len. 28]: Honor is sensitive as to her enormous fortune , and suspects : -- '' _ Robert Carr , Hero in Chief _ , of being attracted thereby .
Parsing [sent. 1114 len. 11]: Robert Carr is a barrister engaged in climbing the ladder .
Parsing [sent. 1115 len. 27]: He loves Honor , but resents her attitude , and talks assiduously to : -- '' _ Patricia O'Shaughnessy _ , youngest scion of the house .
Parsing [sent. 1116 len. 12]: Patricia is plain , but fascinating , and of noble disposition .
Parsing [sent. 1117 len. 8]: She is anxious to reconcile the lovers .
Parsing [sent. 1118 len. 28]: The more so as she herself prefers the companionship of : -- '' _ Stanor Vaughan , Secondary Hero _ , a beauteous youth of fair estate .
Parsing [sent. 1119 len. 14]: Stanor being ardently in love with himself , does not return her passion .
Parsing [sent. 1120 len. 7]: He treats her with sisterly affection .
Parsing [sent. 1121 len. 10]: Patricia hides her chagrin beneath a mask of gaiety .
Parsing [sent. 1122 len. 10]: `` How 's that for a start , Honey ?
Parsing [sent. 1123 len. 5]: Pretty thrilling , eh ?
Parsing [sent. 1124 len. 8]: Do n't be anxious about the mask !
Parsing [sent. 1125 len. 39]: It 's so life-like that it deceives even myself into believing that it 's the genuine article , but when dramatic happenings are around , it is n't Pixie O'Shaughnessy who will stand aside and take no part !
Parsing [sent. 1126 len. 9]: `` On Wednesday we went for a picnic .
Parsing [sent. 1127 len. 27]: It was meant to be a picnic _ de luxe _ , but fate was kind to us , and it turned out very alfresco indeed .
Parsing [sent. 1128 len. 42]: We started in the big car , Geoffrey driving , and all sorts of good things piled up in hampers , and at an appointed place the chauffeur met us and took possession , while we walked on through the woods .
Parsing [sent. 1129 len. 55]: Such woods , Bridgie ; all sweet , and dim , and green , the trunks of the great old beeches standing up straight and tall like the pillars of a great cathedral , and sweet , innocent little primroses peeping up through the moss , and last year 's leaves crackling under foot .
Parsing [sent. 1130 len. 13]: Those primroses went straight to my head ; I felt quite fey .
Parsing [sent. 1131 len. 26]: `` Strictly , between me and your sisterly ear , I was _ very amusing indeed _ , and they all appreciated me very much !
Parsing [sent. 1132 len. 13]: And we laughed and talked , and finally began to sing . ''
Parsing [sent. 1133 len. 12]: ` You have a quite too beautiful voice , Miss O'Shaughnessy .
Parsing [sent. 1134 len. 13]: Wo n't you sing to us in the drawing-room to-night ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 1135 len. 6]: ` How sweet of you !
Parsing [sent. 1136 len. 11]: Really , I shall be _ too _ charmed ! '
Parsing [sent. 1137 len. 10]: -LRB- This is the orthodox fashionable manner of speaking .
Parsing [sent. 1138 len. 8]: Let us be fashionable or die ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 1139 len. 5]: `` We sang glees .
Parsing [sent. 1140 len. 58]: Esmeralda and I took contralto ; there was practically no treble , for Honor 's squeak was drowned fathoms deep ; Geoffrey and Mr Carr droned bass , and Stanor Vaughan took tenor , rather out of tune it 's true , but no man with that profile could be expected to condescend to _ bass _ !
Parsing [sent. 1141 len. 54]: We sang ` Come and _ see _ the daylight dawning , on the meadow far away , ' and Mr Carr said he must really make a point of going some day , and we 've planned an early walk for next week , if any one can wake up in time .
Parsing [sent. 1142 len. 56]: We roared ` All among the barley , ' until the primroses looked quite abashed , and turned into ` Good-night , good-night beloved , ' to soothe them down again , and we grew so intimate and festive , and they all said , ` What next , Miss O'Shaughnessy , what next ? '
Parsing [sent. 1143 len. 13]: Really , my dear , I was a _ succes fou _ .
Parsing [sent. 1144 len. 8]: `` But more is yet to come .
Parsing [sent. 1145 len. 61]: It was so lovely and we were enjoying ourselves so much , that we dallied about , and took extra little detours , so that it was nearly two o'clock when we arrived at the appointed spot , and imagine , my dear , our thwarted hunger and thirst , when not a vestige of a car could we behold !
Parsing [sent. 1146 len. 27]: It was no use _ waiting _ , because if all had gone right it should have been waiting for us for an hour at least .
Parsing [sent. 1147 len. 15]: So we held a council of war at the side of the road . ''
Parsing [sent. 1148 len. 4]: _ Esmeralda _ .
Parsing [sent. 1149 len. 11]: ` I shall give Dawson notice _ At Once _ !
Parsing [sent. 1150 len. 14]: He has made some stupid mistake , and gone to the wrong place .
Parsing [sent. 1151 len. 8]: I 've no patience with blunderers . '
Parsing [sent. 1152 len. 7]: -LRB- She has n't . -RRB- ''
Parsing [sent. 1153 len. 4]: _ Geoffrey _ .
Parsing [sent. 1154 len. 10]: ` Something may have gone wrong with the car .
Parsing [sent. 1155 len. 16]: Do n't blame the poor fellow till you are sure he deserves it . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 1156 len. 4]: _ Stanor _ .
Parsing [sent. 1157 len. 10]: ` I do n't care one rap about Dawson .
Parsing [sent. 1158 len. 5]: I want my lunch !
Parsing [sent. 1159 len. 6]: _ With _ the luxuries !
Parsing [sent. 1160 len. 12]: What price expectation _ now _ , Miss O'Shaughnessy ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 1161 len. 4]: _ Honor _ .
Parsing [sent. 1162 len. 17]: ` I 'm sorry to be disagreeable , but I 've a blister on my heel .
Parsing [sent. 1163 len. 26]: If it 's a case of walking back , I must bid you all a fond adieu and take to a forest life . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 1164 len. 5]: _ Robert Carr _ .
Parsing [sent. 1165 len. 18]: ` What can you expect if you start out on a country walk in ball-room slippers ? '
Parsing [sent. 1166 len. 56]: `` Honor said : ` They are n't , and , anyway , I do n't expect sympathy from _ you _ , ' and _ I _ said : ` Is n't there an opening into the road a little nearer the village where the car may be waiting all the time ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 1167 len. 17]: ` Mrs Dick , ' quoted Geoffrey , -- ` your common sense is invaluable ! '
Parsing [sent. 1168 len. 31]: and off he started in advance while we all trailed in the rear , along the dusty high-road this time , and not by any means in a singing mood .
Parsing [sent. 1169 len. 7]: Esmeralda stalked , and Honor limped .
Parsing [sent. 1170 len. 56]: She had n't done it a bit before , so it came on rather suddenly , and Stanor offered her his arm , and she hung upon it , and Mr Carr talked politics to me , and I tried to quote Dick 's remarks and appear intelligent , but it did n't come off .
Parsing [sent. 1171 len. 9]: `` It was a mile , and more .
Parsing [sent. 1172 len. 18]: It seemed like three , and when we arrived at the opening the car was not there .
Parsing [sent. 1173 len. 13]: We sat down against the dusty hedgerow and gave way to despair .
Parsing [sent. 1174 len. 23]: Here we were stranded five weary miles from our base , i.e. the hampers , and what were we going to do ?
Parsing [sent. 1175 len. 24]: Every one had a different suggestion , but the object of them all was the same -- _ get something to eat _ .
Parsing [sent. 1176 len. 15]: It 's humiliating how greedy people become when they are defrauded of a meal !
Parsing [sent. 1177 len. 61]: Dawson and the car were forgotten , everything was forgotten , and when I said that doctors were agreed that we ate too much , and an occasional starve was the most healthy thing that could happen , they looked coldly on me , and Stanor said doctors might keep their theories , but give him _ foie gras _ !
Parsing [sent. 1178 len. 24]: Finally we agreed to be scouts and go forth on a foraging expedition through the tiny village , seeking what we might devour .
Parsing [sent. 1179 len. 18]: Geoffrey was the scout-master , and we were to meet him at the second lamp-post and report .
Parsing [sent. 1180 len. 22]: `` There were half a dozen cottages , one shop , and a yard where they sold coal and fresh eggs .
Parsing [sent. 1181 len. 13]: So that meant a cottage each , and the stores thrown in .
Parsing [sent. 1182 len. 26]: Our orders were to knock on each door and stand close so as to have a good view of the interior when it was opened .
Parsing [sent. 1183 len. 46]: If it was a dirty interior we were to dissemble , and ask the way ; if it was clean , we were to say , ` Oh , if you please , we are stranded motorists , and do you supply plain teas ? '
Parsing [sent. 1184 len. 29]: In case of _ two _ being clean , the choice was to be left with the scout-master , who would decide between them with tact and discretion .
Parsing [sent. 1185 len. 9]: `` Bridgie , it _ was _ sport !
Parsing [sent. 1186 len. 28]: They were _ all _ clean , and they _ all _ supplied plain teas , but the astounding part was that no one could supply milk !
Parsing [sent. 1187 len. 18]: -LRB- Esmeralda says she has never yet raided an English cottage where they _ could _ . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 1188 len. 21]: And they all offered the same bill of fare -- tea with tinned milk , eggs , and spring onions !
Parsing [sent. 1189 len. 36]: We chose the biggest and airiest cottage , ordered eggs , looked haughtily at onions , adjourned to the village store and tried to discover some accessories among the rope , firewood , and linoleum .
Parsing [sent. 1190 len. 77]: There was tinned salmon , but Esmeralda said she objected to us dying on her hands , and loaf sugar , and treacle , and bull 's - eyes in a glass bottle , and gingerbread biscuits -LRB- but the snap had departed , and they were so soft that you could have rolled them in balls -RRB- , and some _ very _ strong-looking cheese , and rows of dried herrings packed in a box .
Parsing [sent. 1191 len. 50]: `` It was Hobson 's choice , so we bought a herring apiece , and insisted on having each one wrapped up in paper , and carrying it across the road in our own separate hands , and _ I _ bought a pound of bull 's - eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1192 len. 10]: They are such encouraging things on a long walk !
Parsing [sent. 1193 len. 9]: `` It was a _ delicious _ tea .
Parsing [sent. 1194 len. 59]: The milk was rather greasy and hard to mix , but if you did n't think about it , it tasted almost as good as real , the eggs were fresh , and the herrings so good that Stanor ran across the road for more , and we made time with bread and butter until they were cooked .
Parsing [sent. 1195 len. 39]: And we gave not a thought to the motor ; it was only when the sixth plate of bread and butter had been eaten to a crumb that we remembered the miles between us and the nearest station .
Parsing [sent. 1196 len. 27]: Five or six it was , nothing to trouble ordinary people , even if they would have preferred a comfortable car , but there was Honor !
Parsing [sent. 1197 len. 41]: She had slipped off her shoe under the table , and when she tried to put it on again it hurt so badly that she could hardly hobble across the room , and there was not a vehicle within miles .
Parsing [sent. 1198 len. 51]: `` We all fussed and wondered what could be done , except Mr Carr , who strolled calmly out of the house without a word , lighting a cigarette as he went , and after that Honor 's foot got so suddenly worse that the tears came to her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1199 len. 26]: Five minutes later when we were still fussing and settling nothing , back he came , and in his hands , what do you think ?
Parsing [sent. 1200 len. 14]: -- you 'd never guess -- a pair of men 's carpet slippers !
Parsing [sent. 1201 len. 42]: I remember in a dim , sub-conscious fashion having seen them hanging up in drab and crimson bunches from the ceiling of the shop , but it had never occurred to me that they were to _ wear _ ! '' ''
Parsing [sent. 1202 len. 8]: ` You can walk in these ! '
Parsing [sent. 1203 len. 27]: said Mr Carr coolly , and without waiting to hear Honor 's reply , he went down on his knees , and began unbuttoning her shoe .
Parsing [sent. 1204 len. 33]: She has the daintiest mite of a foot you ever saw -- it looked like a doll 's in his big , strong hand -- but she was n't a bit grateful .
Parsing [sent. 1205 len. 34]: There was a look on her face which sent all the others crowding to the door , but she glared at me to stay , and , being curious , I obeyed . ''
Parsing [sent. 1206 len. 15]: ` Mr Carr , ' says she , -- ` this is too much !
Parsing [sent. 1207 len. 27]: It is usual in my country for a man to ask a girl what she wants , before he takes it upon himself to dictate ! '
Parsing [sent. 1208 len. 8]: `` He went on unfastening the shoe .
Parsing [sent. 1209 len. 17]: `` Occasionally one meets people who do n't know what they _ do _ want ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1210 len. 10]: ` Well , I reckon I _ do _ .
Parsing [sent. 1211 len. 10]: And it do n't happen to be carpet slippers .
Parsing [sent. 1212 len. 6]: I 'd look a guy .
Parsing [sent. 1213 len. 10]: What are you taking off that shoe for anyway ?
Parsing [sent. 1214 len. 8]: That foot 's all right ! ' ''
Parsing [sent. 1215 len. 8]: ` It would n't be right long .
Parsing [sent. 1216 len. 12]: One flat shoe and one French heel make a poor pair .
Parsing [sent. 1217 len. 9]: You are going to wear both . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 1218 len. 7]: ` They 're miles too large .
Parsing [sent. 1219 len. 10]: They 'd fall off on the road . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 1220 len. 8]: ` Oh , no they wo n't .
Parsing [sent. 1221 len. 34]: I 'll take care of that , ' he said coolly , and took from his pocket two strong black bootlaces which he proceeded to criss-cross over the instep and round the ankles .
Parsing [sent. 1222 len. 20]: She sat quite still watching him , her eyes very bright , her hands twisted together on her lap .
Parsing [sent. 1223 len. 21]: When he had finished she put out her feet and stared at them -- they _ did _ look boats !
Parsing [sent. 1224 len. 8]: -- then she looked down at him .
Parsing [sent. 1225 len. 38]: He was still kneeling , and there was not a sound to be heard in that kitchen but the tick of the old clock and the beat , beat , beat of Pixie O'Shaughnessy 's heart . ''
Parsing [sent. 1226 len. 24]: ` Do n't you care , ' said she softly , ` a mite _ how _ -- I -- look ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 1227 len. 10]: ` Not a mite , ' says he coolly .
Parsing [sent. 1228 len. 10]: ` I care how you _ feel _ ! '
Parsing [sent. 1229 len. 62]: `` There was a look in his eyes which was not carpet slippers , far from it , and Honor leaped up and swept to the door with what was intended to be a haughty ` sweep , ' but the slippers pad-padded at each step in a sort of shuffle , which was the unhaughtiest thing you could possibly imagine .
Parsing [sent. 1230 len. 29]: Then Mr Carr gathered up the two tiny brown shoes and dusted them carefully with his handkerchief , and slipped one into each pocket of his Norfolk coat .
Parsing [sent. 1231 len. 43]: Honor never bothered about her shoes : I suppose you do n't when you own factories , but Mr Carr walked all the way with his hands in his pockets as if he had got something there that he liked to hold .
Parsing [sent. 1232 len. 24]: `` The children of the village followed us as we went , and called out , ` Hi , look at her feet !
Parsing [sent. 1233 len. 14]: Hi , Miss , is there room for me in them slippers ? '
Parsing [sent. 1234 len. 9]: as of course they would , bless them !
Parsing [sent. 1235 len. 11]: And I will say for her she took it smiling .
Parsing [sent. 1236 len. 19]: `` Two miles along the road the car met us , poor Dawson apoplectic with distress and confusion .
Parsing [sent. 1237 len. 33]: The engine had gone wrong , and he had had a terrible time getting it put right , and was distracted because he could find no way of sending on the hampers .
Parsing [sent. 1238 len. 23]: We tumbled in and whirled home in peace and safety , but some of us were glad it had not come before .
Parsing [sent. 1239 len. 13]: `` Do n't you wonder how I 've accomplished this mammoth letter ?
Parsing [sent. 1240 len. 76]: There are so many times a day in this house when one has to dress in something different , to do the next thing on the programme , and experience has proved that I change in about a quarter the time taken by the others , so down I sit and fill up the wait by scribbling a page or two more , and I hope , my dear , the result will amuse you .
Parsing [sent. 1241 len. 33]: `` I wear my best clothes all day long , eat indigestible food , go to bed late , get up later , and have Esmeralda 's maid to do my hair .
Parsing [sent. 1242 len. 37]: You 'd think it would need an effort to change into a fine lady all at once , but it does n't ; you just slip in , and feel like a sleek , stroked cat .
Parsing [sent. 1243 len. 12]: My dear , I was born to be a Society Belle !
Parsing [sent. 1244 len. 4]: `` Pixie . ''
Parsing [sent. 1245 len. 3]: CHAPTER NINE .
Parsing [sent. 1246 len. 3]: A RIFT .
Parsing [sent. 1247 len. 53]: `` Let me break it to you tenderly , '' said Mrs Hilliard to her guests at breakfast on the morning after the picnic , `` that on Thursday there is a bazaar , and that it 's no use any of you making plans for that day or the morning before .
Parsing [sent. 1248 len. 32]: The real reason why I invited you all just at this particular time is that you might assist , and be bright and pleasant and make my stall a success . ''
Parsing [sent. 1249 len. 23]: She smiled beguilingly as she spoke , and no one could be more beguiling than Joan when it suited her own purpose .
Parsing [sent. 1250 len. 30]: But her blandishments failed to propitiate her hearers , who one and all laid down knives and forks and fell back in their seats in attitudes expressive of dismay .
Parsing [sent. 1251 len. 4]: `` A bazaar .
Parsing [sent. 1252 len. 4]: _ Assist _ ?
Parsing [sent. 1253 len. 3]: What bazaar ?
Parsing [sent. 1254 len. 2]: Where ?
Parsing [sent. 1255 len. 3]: What for ?
Parsing [sent. 1256 len. 5]: This is too sudden !
Parsing [sent. 1257 len. 7]: Why were we not warned ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1258 len. 4]: Joan twinkled mischievously .
Parsing [sent. 1259 len. 9]: `` I was afraid you would run away .
Parsing [sent. 1260 len. 7]: People are so surly about bazaars .
Parsing [sent. 1261 len. 11]: It 's in the village ; for a parish nurse .
Parsing [sent. 1262 len. 24]: She 's new , and needs a cottage and furniture , and clothes and salary , and the money has to be found .
Parsing [sent. 1263 len. 20]: I wanted Geoffrey to give it right out , it 's so much simpler , but he would n't .
Parsing [sent. 1264 len. 12]: He thought it was right that other people should help . ''
Parsing [sent. 1265 len. 5]: Geoffrey Hilliard said nothing .
Parsing [sent. 1266 len. 54]: It was true that he thought it a wrong attitude for a whole parish to depend upon the gifts of one rich man , but an even stronger reason had been his desire to induce his wife to take some active interest in her poorer neighbours and to occupy herself on their behalf .
Parsing [sent. 1267 len. 69]: When Joan had unwillingly consented to take the principal stall at the bazaar , he had complacently expected a succession of committee meetings and sewing-bees , which would make a wholesome interest in a life spent too entirely in self-gratification ; but the weeks had passed by , and the bazaar was at hand , and so far he had observed no symptoms of work on its behalf .
Parsing [sent. 1268 len. 15]: He sat silently , waiting to glean information through the questioning of his guests .
Parsing [sent. 1269 len. 10]: `` I 've taken part in bazaars before now .
Parsing [sent. 1270 len. 7]: I 'm an expert at bazaars .
Parsing [sent. 1271 len. 24]: Bridgie has had part of a stall several times for things for the regiment ; but _ where is your work _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1272 len. 4]: demanded Pixie sternly .
Parsing [sent. 1273 len. 61]: `` When you take part in a bazaar it means every room crowded out with cushions and tidies , and mats and pincushions , and sitting up at nights , finishing off and sewing on prices , and days of packing up at the end , to say nothing of circulars and invitations , and your own aprons and caps .
Parsing [sent. 1274 len. 9]: I have n't noticed a bit of fuss .
Parsing [sent. 1275 len. 16]: How _ can _ you be going to have a bazaar without any fuss ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1276 len. 35]: She looked so accusingly at her sister as she spoke that the others laughed , but there was a hint of uneasiness in the manner in which Joan glanced at her husband before replying .
Parsing [sent. 1277 len. 6]: `` There is n't any .
Parsing [sent. 1278 len. 5]: Why should there be ?
Parsing [sent. 1279 len. 24]: Fancy work is n't my _ forte _ , and it would bore me to sobs _ living _ bazaar for months ahead .
Parsing [sent. 1280 len. 26]: I 've sent money to order ready-mades , and there are a pile of packing-cases stored away upstairs which will provide more than we want .
Parsing [sent. 1281 len. 14]: They _ ought _ to do , considering the money I 've spent !
Parsing [sent. 1282 len. 10]: I expect the things will be all right . ''
Parsing [sent. 1283 len. 9]: `` Have n't you _ looked _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1284 len. 22]: cried Pixie blankly , while Geoffrey flushed , shrugged his shoulders , and muttered a sarcastic `` Charity made easy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1285 len. 11]: which brought an answering flash into his wife 's eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1286 len. 21]: `` Is there anything particularly estimable in upsetting a whole house and wasting time in manufacturing fal-lals which nobody needs ?
Parsing [sent. 1287 len. 22]: I fail to see it , '' she retorted sharply , and Geoffrey shrugged again , his face grim and displeased .
Parsing [sent. 1288 len. 32]: It was not a pleasant moment for the listeners , and one and all were grateful to Stanor Vaughan for the easy volubility , with which he dashed to the rescue .
Parsing [sent. 1289 len. 12]: `` I 'll open the cases for you , Mrs Hilliard .
Parsing [sent. 1290 len. 18]: I 'm a nailer at opening cases ; ought to have been a furniture remover by profession .
Parsing [sent. 1291 len. 21]: Give me wood and nails , and a litter of straw and sawdust , and I 'm in my element .
Parsing [sent. 1292 len. 15]: Better take 'em down to the hall and unpack them there , I suppose ?
Parsing [sent. 1293 len. 5]: Safest plan with breakables .
Parsing [sent. 1294 len. 8]: Jolly good crockery you get from abroad !
Parsing [sent. 1295 len. 32]: I was at winter sports with my sister , and she fell in love with a green pottery cruse business , half a franc , and as big as your head .
Parsing [sent. 1296 len. 30]: I argued with her for an hour , but it was no good , buy it she would , and cuddled it in her arms the whole way home !
Parsing [sent. 1297 len. 17]: If you have any green cruses , Mrs Hilliard , I 'll buy a dozen ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1298 len. 16]: Esmeralda thanked him , and proceeded to explain her arrangements in a manner elaborately composed .
Parsing [sent. 1299 len. 16]: It appeared that she had displayed considerable ingenuity in the way of saving herself trouble .
Parsing [sent. 1300 len. 18]: `` I sent instructions to each place that every article was to be marked in plain figures .
Parsing [sent. 1301 len. 17]: We shall just have to translate them into English money and add on a little more .
Parsing [sent. 1302 len. 8]: It 's unnecessary to re-mark everything afresh .
Parsing [sent. 1303 len. 30]: I 've engaged a joiner to be at the hall ready to fix up any boards or shelves which we may need , and of course he 'll unpack .
Parsing [sent. 1304 len. 27]: There 's not the slightest reason for any one else to break his nails ; there will be enough work for us on the day . ''
Parsing [sent. 1305 len. 11]: `` Are we to be dressed up in fancy character ?
Parsing [sent. 1306 len. 21]: It 's all so sudden that I 'd like to know the worst at once , '' sighed Honor plaintively .
Parsing [sent. 1307 len. 41]: `` I 've been a Swiss maiden , and I 've been a Dolly Varden , and I 've been the Old Woman that lived in a Shoe , so I guess I can bear another turn of the screw .
Parsing [sent. 1308 len. 12]: But I look real sweet in my new blue gown . ''
Parsing [sent. 1309 len. 9]: `` Wear it , then , wear it .
Parsing [sent. 1310 len. 12]: It 's ridiculous dressing up in daylight in a village hall .
Parsing [sent. 1311 len. 10]: Let every one wear what suits them best . ''
Parsing [sent. 1312 len. 9]: `` Wait till you see my waistcoat ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1313 len. 18]: cried Stanor , and they rose from the table laughing , and breakfast was at an end .
Parsing [sent. 1314 len. 7]: Pixie made straight for the nursery .
Parsing [sent. 1315 len. 41]: She was jarred and troubled by the scene which had just taken place , all the more so as it was by no means the first occasion during her short visit when Geoffrey and Joan had unmistakably `` jarred . ''
Parsing [sent. 1316 len. 44]: In the old days at Knock Castle Esmeralda 's tantrums had been accepted as part of the daily life , but six years spent in the sunshine of Bridgie 's home made a difference between husband and wife seem something abnormal and shocking .
Parsing [sent. 1317 len. 6]: Imagine Dick sneering at Bridgie !
Parsing [sent. 1318 len. 10]: Imagine Bridgie snapping back and relapsing into haughty indifference !
Parsing [sent. 1319 len. 7]: The thing was preposterous , unthinkable !
Parsing [sent. 1320 len. 20]: Could that be the reason of Esmeralda 's unrest , that she and her husband had outgrown their love ?
Parsing [sent. 1321 len. 44]: Pixie felt it equally impossible at that moment to sit quietly alone , or to talk naturally to her fellow-guests , but experience had proved that the most absolutely certain method of getting out of herself was to court the society of children .
Parsing [sent. 1322 len. 33]: So she shut herself in the nursery with the two small boys , who took eery advantage of the unexpected treat without troubling their heads as to how it had come about .
Parsing [sent. 1323 len. 42]: Meantime the three guests started off on the usual morning peregrination of the grounds , and Joan followed her husband to his study , found him staring aimlessly out of the window , and accosted him in cold and biting tones .
Parsing [sent. 1324 len. 10]: `` Geoffrey , I wish to speak to you .
Parsing [sent. 1325 len. 35]: You are entitled to your own opinions , but the next time that you find them in opposition to mine I should be obliged if you would reserve your remarks until we are alone .
Parsing [sent. 1326 len. 29]: If you have no consideration for me , you might at least consider your guests ; it can not be agreeable for them to overhear our differences . ''
Parsing [sent. 1327 len. 5]: Geoffrey did not move .
Parsing [sent. 1328 len. 32]: He stood with his hands thrust deep into his pockets , his head drooping forward on his breast , an air of weariness and depression in every line of his figure .
Parsing [sent. 1329 len. 32]: For a minute there was silence , then he spoke , slowly , and with frequent breaks , as though considering each word as it came -- `` That is true .
Parsing [sent. 1330 len. 6]: -- I was to blame .
Parsing [sent. 1331 len. 10]: -- I should have waited , as you say .
Parsing [sent. 1332 len. 9]: -- It shall not occur again , Joan .
Parsing [sent. 1333 len. 4]: I apologise . ''
Parsing [sent. 1334 len. 5]: Esmeralda looked at him .
Parsing [sent. 1335 len. 11]: The fire died from her eyes , her lips trembled .
Parsing [sent. 1336 len. 21]: Quick to anger , she was equally quick to penitence , and a soft word could melt her hardest mood .
Parsing [sent. 1337 len. 19]: She made a very lovely picture at that moment , but her husband 's back was still turned .
Parsing [sent. 1338 len. 21]: He kept his head rigorously turned aside as he crossed to his desk and seated himself on his swivel chair .
Parsing [sent. 1339 len. 14]: `` I have ordered the car for eleven , as you wished . ''
Parsing [sent. 1340 len. 5]: `` Thank you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1341 len. 15]: Joan knew herself to be dismissed , but she had no intention of obeying .
Parsing [sent. 1342 len. 23]: For her impetuous nature half-measures did not exist , and a peace that was not peace with honour seemed unworthy the name .
Parsing [sent. 1343 len. 14]: She leaned over her husband 's desk , facing him with earnest eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1344 len. 3]: `` Geoffrey !
Parsing [sent. 1345 len. 6]: Why were you so cross ?
Parsing [sent. 1346 len. 4]: It was unreasonable .
Parsing [sent. 1347 len. 9]: I shall do quite well at my stall .
Parsing [sent. 1348 len. 33]: People are sick to death of cushions and cosies , but they will snap at my beautiful things from abroad , which they do n't often have a chance of buying . ''
Parsing [sent. 1349 len. 8]: `` I am sure of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1350 len. 7]: `` Then why -- why -- ?
Parsing [sent. 1351 len. 11]: What on earth put you into such a bait ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1352 len. 11]: Geoffrey put down his pen and drew a long sigh .
Parsing [sent. 1353 len. 20]: It was easy to see that he dreaded a discussion , and was most unwillingly drawn into its toils .
Parsing [sent. 1354 len. 23]: `` Since you ask me , Joan , I was disappointed that you had taken so little personal trouble over the affair .
Parsing [sent. 1355 len. 24]: I could have given the money easily enough ; when I refused I was thinking more of you than of any one else .
Parsing [sent. 1356 len. 32]: I hoped this bazaar might be the means of taking you out of yourself , of bringing you in contact with people whose lives are not altogether given up to self-indulgence .
Parsing [sent. 1357 len. 14]: Your one idea seems to have been to avoid such a course . ''
Parsing [sent. 1358 len. 32]: `` You would have liked me to have sewing meetings here as Mrs Ewart has at the vicarage : plain sewing from two to four , and then tea and buns .
Parsing [sent. 1359 len. 26]: You would have liked to see me sitting in the evening embroidering wild roses on tray cloths , and binding shaving-cases with blue ribbon ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1360 len. 9]: `` I would , '' said Geoffrey sturdily .
Parsing [sent. 1361 len. 24]: He did not smile , as he had been expected to do , but sat grim and grave , refusing to be cajoled .
Parsing [sent. 1362 len. 7]: Esmeralda 's anger mounted once more .
Parsing [sent. 1363 len. 14]: `` Then I call it stupid and bigoted , and I absolutely disagree .
Parsing [sent. 1364 len. 26]: If I 'm to waste my time , I 'll waste it in my own way , not in perpetrating atrocities to disfigure another home .
Parsing [sent. 1365 len. 18]: And I hate village sewing meetings and the dull , ugly frumps who go to them . ''
Parsing [sent. 1366 len. 17]: Mr Hilliard took up his pen , squared his elbows , and quietly began to write .
Parsing [sent. 1367 len. 13]: `` Geoffrey , ca n't you answer when I speak to you !
Parsing [sent. 1368 len. 11]: I 'm not a child to be cowed and snubbed !
Parsing [sent. 1369 len. 14]: I -- I hate you when you get into this superior mood ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1370 len. 21]: Geoffrey lifted his face -- was it the strong east light which made it suddenly appear so lined and worn ?
Parsing [sent. 1371 len. 14]: There was no anger in his face , only a very pitiful sadness .
Parsing [sent. 1372 len. 19]: `` I am afraid there are many moods in which you ` hate ' me , Esmeralda . ''
Parsing [sent. 1373 len. 22]: The look on his face , the sound of the old pet name were too much for the warm Irish heart .
Parsing [sent. 1374 len. 28]: In a moment his wife was on her knees beside him , holding his hands , pressing them to her lips , stroking them with caressing fingers .
Parsing [sent. 1375 len. 16]: `` Geoff , Geoff , it is n't true ; you know it is n't .
Parsing [sent. 1376 len. 9]: I always love you , I always did .
Parsing [sent. 1377 len. 6]: You know it is true .
Parsing [sent. 1378 len. 15]: I was ready to marry you when I thought you had n't a penny .
Parsing [sent. 1379 len. 7]: I wanted nothing but yourself . ''
Parsing [sent. 1380 len. 16]: `` I never forget it , '' said Geoffrey deeply ; `` I never can .
Parsing [sent. 1381 len. 19]: Sometimes -- sometimes I wish it had been true , it might have been better for us both .
Parsing [sent. 1382 len. 19]: ` All that riches can buy ' has not made a happy woman of you , Esmeralda . ''
Parsing [sent. 1383 len. 26]: He stroked back the hair from her broad , low brow , looking with troubled eyes at the fine lines which already marked its surface .
Parsing [sent. 1384 len. 38]: `` I can give my wife many treasures , but apparently not the thing she needs most of all -- the happiness which Dick Victor manages to provide for Bridgie on a few hundreds a year ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1385 len. 15]: `` Bridgie is Bridgie , and I 'm myself ; we were born different .
Parsing [sent. 1386 len. 18]: It 's not fair to compare us , and the advantages are not all on one side .
Parsing [sent. 1387 len. 21]: If she has not had my opportunities , she has escaped the temptations ; she might have grown selfish too .
Parsing [sent. 1388 len. 17]: Sometimes I hate money , Geoffrey ; it 's a millstone round one 's neck . ''
Parsing [sent. 1389 len. 4]: `` No ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1390 len. 5]: Geoffrey squared his shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 1391 len. 6]: `` It 's a lever .
Parsing [sent. 1392 len. 28]: I am glad to be rich ; my father worked hard for his money -- it was honourably gained , and I 'm proud to inherit it .
Parsing [sent. 1393 len. 37]: It is a responsibility , a heavy one , if you like , but one is bound to have responsibilities in life , and it 's a fine thing to have one which holds such possibilities .
Parsing [sent. 1394 len. 12]: I mean to bring up the boys to take that view .
Parsing [sent. 1395 len. 30]: But -- '' he paused heavily -- `` I 'd give it up to-morrow if it could purchase peace and tranquillity , a rest from this everlasting strain ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1396 len. 17]: Something tightened over Joan 's heart ; a chill as of fear passed through her blood .
Parsing [sent. 1397 len. 17]: Geoffrey spoke quietly , so sanely , with an unmistakable air of knowing his own mind .
Parsing [sent. 1398 len. 25]: And his manner was so cool , so detached , not one lover-like word or action had he vouchsafed in answer to her own .
Parsing [sent. 1399 len. 16]: A chill passed through Joan 's veins , the chill of dismay which presages disaster .
Parsing [sent. 1400 len. 25]: At that moment she divined the certainty of what she had never before even dimly imagined -- the waning of her husband 's love .
Parsing [sent. 1401 len. 33]: Like too many beautiful young wives , she had taken for granted that her place in her husband 's heart was established for life , independent of any effort to retain it .
Parsing [sent. 1402 len. 37]: She had not realised that love is a treasure which must needs be guarded with jealous care , that the delicate cord may be strained so thin that a moment may come when it reaches breaking-point .
Parsing [sent. 1403 len. 23]: That moment had not come yet ; surely , surely , it could not have come , but she felt the shadow .
Parsing [sent. 1404 len. 12]: `` Do n't you love me any more , Geoffrey ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1405 len. 4]: she asked faintly .
Parsing [sent. 1406 len. 18]: `` In spite of all my faults , do you love me still like you did ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1407 len. 43]: It was the inevitable ending to a dissension , the inevitable question which he had answered a hundred times , and if to-day there was a new tone in the voice which spoke it , Geoffrey was not sensitive enough to notice .
Parsing [sent. 1408 len. 12]: Few men would mark such differences in a moment of tension .
Parsing [sent. 1409 len. 12]: `` I love you , Joan , '' he answered wearily .
Parsing [sent. 1410 len. 15]: `` You are my wife ; but you 've rubbed off the bloom ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1411 len. 14]: ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Joan got up quietly from her knees and crossed to the door .
Parsing [sent. 1412 len. 46]: The voice within declared that Geoffrey would call her back , that he would leap after her and clasp her in his arms , as he had done a score of times in like circumstances , that he would implore forgiveness for his cruel words .
Parsing [sent. 1413 len. 26]: She walked slowly , pausing as she went to put a chair against the wall , to alter the position of a vase of flowers .
Parsing [sent. 1414 len. 11]: She reached the door and cast a swift glance behind .
Parsing [sent. 1415 len. 23]: Geoffrey had gone back to his writing ; his pen travelled swiftly across the page ; he did not raise his head .
Parsing [sent. 1416 len. 3]: CHAPTER TEN .
Parsing [sent. 1417 len. 6]: PIXIE GIVES JOAN A TONIC .
Parsing [sent. 1418 len. 22]: A romp with the children restored Pixie 's elastic spirits , and brought a revived wish for her friends ' society .
Parsing [sent. 1419 len. 38]: She leaned out of the window and beheld a game of tennis on in obvious need of a fourth player , waved gaily in response to a general beckoning , and tripped downstairs singing a glad refrain .
Parsing [sent. 1420 len. 23]: And then , in the corridor outside her boudoir , behold a pale and tragic Esmeralda summoning her with a dramatic hand .
Parsing [sent. 1421 len. 13]: Pixie flounced , and a quiver of indignation stiffened her small body .
Parsing [sent. 1422 len. 35]: A whole hour of a lovely spring morning had already been spent in struggling to overcome the depression caused by the scene at breakfast , and here was Joan obviously preparing a second edition .
Parsing [sent. 1423 len. 16]: Pixie was no niggard in sympathy , but for the moment she had other views .
Parsing [sent. 1424 len. 32]: Two charming young men were waiting without in the sunshine , and any ordinary human girl prefers the sunshine and masculine society , to a room indoors and an hysterical sister .
Parsing [sent. 1425 len. 15]: Therefore , being excessively human , Pixie flounced , and looked bored and impatient .
Parsing [sent. 1426 len. 11]: She entered the room and shut the door behind her .
Parsing [sent. 1427 len. 10]: `` What 's the matter _ now _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1428 len. 6]: The answer was sufficiently unexpected .
Parsing [sent. 1429 len. 23]: `` Pixie , if I die will you promise me faithfully to live here and take charge of my orphan boys ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1430 len. 6]: `` I will not ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1431 len. 4]: snapped Pixie sharply .
Parsing [sent. 1432 len. 24]: It was just what might have been expected for Esmeralda to picture her own tragic death as the result of a passing squall .
Parsing [sent. 1433 len. 24]: Quite possibly she had been sitting for the last hour picturing the stages of her own decline and the grief of the survivors .
Parsing [sent. 1434 len. 11]: Strong common sense was the best remedy she could have .
Parsing [sent. 1435 len. 12]: `` I hope to have my own home to look after .
Parsing [sent. 1436 len. 6]: And they are too spoiled .
Parsing [sent. 1437 len. 8]: I would n't undertake the charge . ''
Parsing [sent. 1438 len. 17]: `` Somebody , '' croaked Esmeralda deeply , `` somebody must look after my boys ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1439 len. 8]: `` Do n't you worry about that .
Parsing [sent. 1440 len. 5]: Geoffrey 'll marry again .
Parsing [sent. 1441 len. 10]: They always do when the children are young . ''
Parsing [sent. 1442 len. 11]: This was deliberate cruelty , but the strain was severe .
Parsing [sent. 1443 len. 14]: Stanor was standing , racket in hand , gazing up at the window .
Parsing [sent. 1444 len. 12]: The sunshine lit up his handsome face , his expectant smile .
Parsing [sent. 1445 len. 39]: Pixie gave another flounce and turned impatiently to meet the next lament ; but Esmeralda was silent , her hands were clasped on her knee , and tears -- _ real _ tears -- shone in her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1446 len. 37]: It was a rare thing for Joan to cry ; the easy tears which rose to her sisters ' eyes in response to any emotion , pleasurable or the reverse , these were not for her .
Parsing [sent. 1447 len. 23]: Looking back over the history of their lives , Pixie could count the number of times when she had seen Joan cry .
Parsing [sent. 1448 len. 13]: The outside world vanished from her memory in response to that appeal .
Parsing [sent. 1449 len. 3]: `` Esmeralda !
Parsing [sent. 1450 len. 4]: _ Darling _ !
Parsing [sent. 1451 len. 5]: You are not ill ?
Parsing [sent. 1452 len. 7]: You are not really suffering ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1453 len. 5]: Joan shook her head .
Parsing [sent. 1454 len. 13]: `` Quite strong , '' she murmured miserably ; `` too strong .
Parsing [sent. 1455 len. 11]: Only it seems impossible to live on in such misery .
Parsing [sent. 1456 len. 9]: It 's gone -- the mainspring , everything !
Parsing [sent. 1457 len. 6]: I ca n't drag along !
Parsing [sent. 1458 len. 9]: Thank God , Pixie , you are here !
Parsing [sent. 1459 len. 8]: I never could bottle up my feelings .
Parsing [sent. 1460 len. 12]: It 's Geoffrey -- he does n't love me any more .
Parsing [sent. 1461 len. 10]: I 'm not imagining it -- it 's true !
Parsing [sent. 1462 len. 6]: He told me himself . ''
Parsing [sent. 1463 len. 7]: `` What did he say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1464 len. 4]: demanded Pixie practically .
Parsing [sent. 1465 len. 31]: She displayed no dismay at the announcement , being used to her sister 's exaggerations , and feeling abundantly convinced in her own mind that this was but another example .
Parsing [sent. 1466 len. 24]: Geoffrey was cross this morning , but five days ' residence under his roof had abundantly demonstrated that his love was not dead .
Parsing [sent. 1467 len. 12]: `` Now , what exactly _ did _ he say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1468 len. 11]: she repeated , and Joan faltered out the dread words .
Parsing [sent. 1469 len. 11]: There was silence in the room for a long minute .
Parsing [sent. 1470 len. 11]: Then Pixie drew in her breath with a sharp intake .
Parsing [sent. 1471 len. 7]: `` The _ bloom _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1472 len. 4]: she repeated softly .
Parsing [sent. 1473 len. 7]: `` The _ bloom _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1474 len. 19]: The beautiful significance of the term seemed to occupy her mind to the exclusion of the personal application .
Parsing [sent. 1475 len. 49]: She had a vision of love as the apotheosis of human affection , a wondrous combination of kindliness , sympathy , courtesy , patience , unselfishness -- all these , _ and something more _ -- that mysterious , intangible quality which Geoffrey Hilliard had so aptly described .
Parsing [sent. 1476 len. 47]: Given `` the bloom , '' affection became idealised , patience a joy , and selfishness ceased to exist , since the well-being of another was preferred before one 's own ; courtesy and sympathy followed automatically , as attendant spirits who could not be separated .
Parsing [sent. 1477 len. 55]: Affection might exist , did often exist , in churlish , unlovely form , giving little happiness either to the giver or the recipient Love , the highest , was something infinitely precious , a treasure to be guarded with infinite care , lest in the stress of life its bloom should be destroyed .
Parsing [sent. 1478 len. 21]: Joan , looking with anxious inquiry in her sister 's face , read there an earnestness even exceeding her own .
Parsing [sent. 1479 len. 8]: `` Oh , _ no _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1480 len. 4]: cried Pixie strongly .
Parsing [sent. 1481 len. 9]: `` Not that , not that , Esmeralda .
Parsing [sent. 1482 len. 4]: Not the bloom .
Parsing [sent. 1483 len. 10]: It must n't go ; it 's too precious .
Parsing [sent. 1484 len. 4]: It means everything .
Parsing [sent. 1485 len. 10]: You must n't _ let _ it go ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1486 len. 11]: `` But I told you it _ had _ gone .
Parsing [sent. 1487 len. 6]: It 's too late . ''
Parsing [sent. 1488 len. 4]: `` No ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1489 len. 5]: Pixie shook her head .
Parsing [sent. 1490 len. 5]: `` I know better .
Parsing [sent. 1491 len. 11]: There 's time yet , if you 'll be warned .
Parsing [sent. 1492 len. 21]: Last night , when you were comforting Jack after his tumble , Geoffrey sat watching you as Dick watches Bridgie .
Parsing [sent. 1493 len. 13]: It ca n't be all gone , when he looks like that .
Parsing [sent. 1494 len. 25]: He has loved you , been proud of you , been patient with you for -- how long is it you have been married ?
Parsing [sent. 1495 len. 13]: Seven years , and you need a lot of patience , Esmeralda !
Parsing [sent. 1496 len. 20]: I suppose it 's come to this -- that you 've used up all the patience he has . ''
Parsing [sent. 1497 len. 25]: It said volumes for Joan 's penitence that she allowed such a statement to pass unchallenged , and even assented to it with meekness .
Parsing [sent. 1498 len. 7]: `` I suppose that 's it .
Parsing [sent. 1499 len. 10]: For the first few years it was all right .
Parsing [sent. 1500 len. 29]: When I got angry he only laughed ; then he began to get impatient himself , and this last year things have been going from bad to worse .
Parsing [sent. 1501 len. 36]: When he spoke straight out it was easier ; there was a row royal , and a grand ` make up ' at the end , but now he 's so cold and calm . ''
Parsing [sent. 1502 len. 21]: Esmeralda 's lip trembled at the remembrance of the scene downstairs of the averted figure writing stolidly at the desk .
Parsing [sent. 1503 len. 34]: She stared before her in silence for a dismal moment , then added sharply : `` And what in the world set him off at a tangent this morning , of all others ?
Parsing [sent. 1504 len. 46]: There have been dozens of times when I should have expected him to be furious , and he 's been as mild as a lamb ; and then of a sudden , when I was all innocent and unsuspicious , to flare up like that !
Parsing [sent. 1505 len. 8]: There 's no sense in it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1506 len. 9]: `` It 's always the way with men .
Parsing [sent. 1507 len. 25]: You ca n't reckon on them , '' announced Pixie , with the seasoned air of one who has endured three husbands at least .
Parsing [sent. 1508 len. 43]: `` Dick 's the same -- an angel of patience till just the moment when you 've made sure of him , and then in a moment he snaps off your head -- my head , I mean , never Bridgie 's .
Parsing [sent. 1509 len. 8]: There 's too much -- bloom . ''
Parsing [sent. 1510 len. 30]: She put her little head on one side and pursed her lips in thought , with the characteristic Pixie air which carried Joan back to the days of childhood .
Parsing [sent. 1511 len. 24]: `` Now , is n't it odd , Esmeralda , how people cultivate almost every good quality , and leave love to chance ?
Parsing [sent. 1512 len. 15]: They practise patience and unselfishness , but seem to think love is beyond control .
Parsing [sent. 1513 len. 8]: It comes , or -- it goes .
Parsing [sent. 1514 len. 5]: _ Tant mieux _ !
Parsing [sent. 1515 len. 5]: _ Tant pis _ !
Parsing [sent. 1516 len. 42]: My dear , if I married a husband who loved me as Geoffrey loved you , it would be the big work of my life to keep him at it , and I 'd expect it to _ be _ work !
Parsing [sent. 1517 len. 23]: You get nothing worth having without trouble , so why should you expect an exception for the very _ best _ thing ?
Parsing [sent. 1518 len. 8]: And the poor man deserves some encouragement .
Parsing [sent. 1519 len. 10]: _ I 'd give it to him _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1520 len. 9]: Joan 's lips twisted into a sad smile .
Parsing [sent. 1521 len. 22]: `` You understand a great deal , Pixie -- more than I do , it seems , even after seven years !
Parsing [sent. 1522 len. 9]: I never looked at things in that light .
Parsing [sent. 1523 len. 13]: I just expected Geoffrey to keep on adoring , whatever I did .
Parsing [sent. 1524 len. 8]: What made you think such things ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1525 len. 4]: `` Nature ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1526 len. 4]: said Pixie promptly .
Parsing [sent. 1527 len. 16]: `` And , my dear , I 'm clever at loving -- I always was .
Parsing [sent. 1528 len. 22]: It 's my only gift , and I _ have _ studied it just as other people study drawing and music .
Parsing [sent. 1529 len. 24]: What you have to do , Esmeralda , is to forget everything and every one else for a while , and comfort Geoffrey .
Parsing [sent. 1530 len. 11]: Do n't make a scene and worry the poor man .
Parsing [sent. 1531 len. 19]: Do n't make a grand programme of reformation , for that will put him off at the start .
Parsing [sent. 1532 len. 12]: Just begin to-night and be sweet to him for a change .
Parsing [sent. 1533 len. 13]: If you feel temper coming on , have it out on me !
Parsing [sent. 1534 len. 30]: I 'm used to you from a child , and if I get too much of it I can always run away and leave you ; Geoffrey ca n't .
Parsing [sent. 1535 len. 14]: It 's mean to take advantage of a man that 's bound . ''
Parsing [sent. 1536 len. 21]: `` If he _ wanted _ to go , '' began Joan haughtily , then subsided into tears and helplessness .
Parsing [sent. 1537 len. 3]: `` Pixie !
Parsing [sent. 1538 len. 2]: Pixie !
Parsing [sent. 1539 len. 5]: It 's so difficult !
Parsing [sent. 1540 len. 6]: What can I do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1541 len. 10]: `` D'you need _ me _ to tell you ?
Parsing [sent. 1542 len. 24]: Is n't it the _ easiest _ thing in the world to make love to your own husband , in your own house ?
Parsing [sent. 1543 len. 4]: Talk of propinquity !
Parsing [sent. 1544 len. 15]: Always ready , always handy , if you ca n't manage _ that _ !
Parsing [sent. 1545 len. 13]: My dear girl , the game 's in your own hands . ''
Parsing [sent. 1546 len. 9]: `` Can a leopard change its spots ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1547 len. 24]: `` We 're not talking of leopards ; we 're talking of women -- and they _ can _ bridle their tongues ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1548 len. 5]: Again Joan was silent .
Parsing [sent. 1549 len. 5]: _ Could she _ ?
Parsing [sent. 1550 len. 50]: A great martyrdom , or heroic effort , these she would have faced gladly , counting them a small price to pay for her husband 's love ; but then how to subdue hasty impulses , to keep a watch over her tongue -- this seemed beyond her strength .
Parsing [sent. 1551 len. 13]: And yet the treasure which was threatened was of such inestimable value .
Parsing [sent. 1552 len. 9]: It was impossible to contemplate life without it .
Parsing [sent. 1553 len. 41]: Human life is uncertain , and though she would not allow herself to dwell upon such a possibility , Joan had realised in her heart that a day might dawn when she would have to part from husband or son .
Parsing [sent. 1554 len. 43]: Death might come , she might have to say farewell to the dear human presence , but never , never had she imagined for a moment that she might be compelled to live on , having bidden farewell to _ love _ !
Parsing [sent. 1555 len. 58]: Geoffrey her lover , Geoffrey her husband , Geoffrey the father of her boys , was it a fact or a dreadful nightmare that he had sat , untouched by her appeal , and confessed that ... that ... Joan winced , unable to bear the repetition , and locked her hands more closely on her knee .
Parsing [sent. 1556 len. 7]: Pixie glanced furtively through the window .
Parsing [sent. 1557 len. 15]: Stanor had turned back to the tennis-ground and the three-handed game had been resumed .
Parsing [sent. 1558 len. 26]: She stifled a pang of disappointment and sat quietly waiting for further confidences , but presently Joan said quietly -- `` Thank you , Pixie .
Parsing [sent. 1559 len. 6]: Now -- will you go ?
Parsing [sent. 1560 len. 5]: I want to think .
Parsing [sent. 1561 len. 7]: You 've been very sweet . ''
Parsing [sent. 1562 len. 17]: `` More bracing than sweet , my dear ; but it was what you needed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1563 len. 33]: Pixie rose with an alacrity which the other was , fortunately , too preoccupied to notice , dropped a kiss on the lovely bent neck , and walked quickly from the room .
Parsing [sent. 1564 len. 26]: Joan had had the relief which her nature demanded of giving expression to her feelings ; now it was best that she should be alone .
Parsing [sent. 1565 len. 16]: Pixie had done her best to help , and now sunshine and Stanor were waiting !
Parsing [sent. 1566 len. 20]: In another five minutes she was playing tennis as whole-heartedly as though it were her only business in life .
Parsing [sent. 1567 len. 31]: Meanwhile Joan sat alone in her upstairs room , struggling with all the force of her ardent , undisciplined nature to brace herself for the struggle which lay before her .
Parsing [sent. 1568 len. 27]: Prayer had become of late a mechanical , stereotype repetition of phrases ; to-day there were no phrases -- hardly , indeed , any definite words .
Parsing [sent. 1569 len. 33]: In the extreme need of life she took refuge in that voiceless cry for help , that child-like opening of the heart which is the truest relationship between the soul and God .
Parsing [sent. 1570 len. 18]: She sat with closed eyes and lifted face , penitent , receptive , waiting to be blessed .
Parsing [sent. 1571 len. 14]: For the time being doubts were forgotten , everything seemed straight and plain .
Parsing [sent. 1572 len. 24]: Then , being Esmeralda , the wayward , the undisciplined , the mood of exultation faded , and depression held her once more .
Parsing [sent. 1573 len. 10]: The heavenly help and guidance seemed far-off and unreal .
Parsing [sent. 1574 len. 16]: She was seized with impetuous necessity to act at once , to act for herself .
Parsing [sent. 1575 len. 10]: Pixie 's proposals failed to satisfy her ardent desires .
Parsing [sent. 1576 len. 14]: To wait weeks or months for the reward she craved was beyond endurance .
Parsing [sent. 1577 len. 21]: She must contrive something big , something soon , something that would demonstrate to Geoffrey her anxiety to please him .
Parsing [sent. 1578 len. 9]: She racked her brain to find a way .
Parsing [sent. 1579 len. 7]: Poor , impatient , undisciplined Esmeralda !
Parsing [sent. 1580 len. 12]: How little she dreamed of the tragic consequences of that hour !
Parsing [sent. 1581 len. 3]: CHAPTER ELEVEN .
Parsing [sent. 1582 len. 5]: PIXIE TALKS ON LOVE .
Parsing [sent. 1583 len. 33]: The immediate cause of Geoffrey 's displeasure having been in connection with the bazaar , it appeared to Joan that it was in that connection also that she must make an amend .
Parsing [sent. 1584 len. 30]: He had complained that she had failed in interest and personal energy : by a supreme effort , then , she must demonstrate how his words had taken root .
Parsing [sent. 1585 len. 52]: It was the eleventh hour ; any one but an impulsive Irish woman would have realised the futility of organising any fresh feature , and would have contented herself with doing well what was already planned , but such tame methods were not for the woman who had been Esmeralda O'Shaughnessy .
Parsing [sent. 1586 len. 73]: She was accustomed to acting in haste ; at home , at Knock , the most extensive entertainments had been organised at a few hours ' notice , and how much easier it would be now with a staff of trained servants at her command and a purse full of money to buy the necessary accessories , instead of being obliged to manufacture all that was required out of ordinary household goods .
Parsing [sent. 1587 len. 51]: Joan heaved a sigh of regret for the memory of those gay old days when a sheet and a pillow-case had provided a fancy costume which had captivated Geoffrey at a glance , then knitted her brows afresh in the effort to think out some scheme appropriate to the occasion .
Parsing [sent. 1588 len. 23]: The vicar 's wife had lamented a lack of music which would afford variation from the prosaic business of buying and selling .
Parsing [sent. 1589 len. 17]: At the time Joan had suspected a hint , and had resolutely turned a deaf ear .
Parsing [sent. 1590 len. 35]: She hated singing to strangers , she hated singing in a building notably deficient in acoustic properties , she had not the faintest intention of victimising herself for the sake of a village throng .
Parsing [sent. 1591 len. 18]: But now , with the new impetus driving her on , nothing seemed too hard or distasteful .
Parsing [sent. 1592 len. 38]: The vicar 's wife should have her music -- music with such accessories as it had never entered her modest head to imagine , music which should be the feature _ par excellence _ of the bazaar .
Parsing [sent. 1593 len. 36]: Joan 's was a quick , inventive brain ; within half an hour she had mentally arranged her programme , made a list of the necessary accessories , and planned how they should be procured .
Parsing [sent. 1594 len. 29]: When the little party were again assembled for luncheon she was able to state her plans with an air of complete assurance which left them breathless with astonishment .
Parsing [sent. 1595 len. 19]: She had decided to provide two short concerts , one in the afternoon , one in the evening .
Parsing [sent. 1596 len. 12]: She would sing two songs ; Pixie should do the same .
Parsing [sent. 1597 len. 9]: They would all join in appropriate part songs .
Parsing [sent. 1598 len. 21]: By way of a climax the last number on the programme should be illustrated by a _ tableau vivant _ .
Parsing [sent. 1599 len. 32]: She proposed to write special words to a well-known air which , together with the tableau , should illustrate the benefits which the bazaar was destined to provide for the villagers .
Parsing [sent. 1600 len. 47]: The tableau should represent a scene in a cottage interior in which were grouped four figures -- a child suffering from an accident , a distraught mother , a helpless father , and in the background , bending beneficently over the patient , the parish nurse .
Parsing [sent. 1601 len. 16]: Esmeralda looked around for approval , and met the stare of blank and doubtful faces .
Parsing [sent. 1602 len. 15]: `` Er -- a bit lugubrious , is n't it , Mrs Hilliard ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1603 len. 20]: ventured Stanor at last , voicing the general impression so strongly that Esmeralda 's imagination instantly took another leap .
Parsing [sent. 1604 len. 49]: `` Certainly not , for I should have a second tableau to follow to show the happy convalescence -- child sitting up in bed , pale but smiling , nurse bringing in bunch of flowers , father and mother , with outstretched hands , pouring out thanks . ''
Parsing [sent. 1605 len. 5]: `` That 's better !
Parsing [sent. 1606 len. 7]: That 's more like it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1607 len. 9]: The murmur of approval passed down the table .
Parsing [sent. 1608 len. 11]: Pixie laid her head on one side in smiling consideration .
Parsing [sent. 1609 len. 32]: Yes , it would go ; arranged with Esmeralda 's skill and taste the scenes would be pretty and touching , especially when seen to the accompaniment of her beautiful voice .
Parsing [sent. 1610 len. 16]: The shortness of the time allowed for preparation troubled Pixie no more than her sister .
Parsing [sent. 1611 len. 10]: She smiled at Esmeralda and nodded a cheery encouragement .
Parsing [sent. 1612 len. 14]: `` I 'll be the distracted mother , and weep into my apron .
Parsing [sent. 1613 len. 9]: Honor will look a duck in a cap .
Parsing [sent. 1614 len. 9]: Who 's to be the little victim ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1615 len. 6]: `` Jack , of course .
Parsing [sent. 1616 len. 13]: He 'll look too sweet , '' said Jack 's proud mother .
Parsing [sent. 1617 len. 31]: `` Ca n't you imagine him , sitting up in bed with his curls peeping out beneath his bandages -- he must have bandages -- smiling like a little angel !
Parsing [sent. 1618 len. 7]: He 'd bring down the house .
Parsing [sent. 1619 len. 9]: The people would love to see him . ''
Parsing [sent. 1620 len. 8]: Then for the first time Geoffrey spoke .
Parsing [sent. 1621 len. 23]: So far he had listened to the conversation in a silence which both his wife and sister-in-law felt to be disappointingly unsympathetic .
Parsing [sent. 1622 len. 25]: Now his objections were put into words -- `` Is n't Jack rather young and -- er -- sensitive for such a public role ?
Parsing [sent. 1623 len. 16]: I should have thought that your concert would be complete without troubling about a tableau .
Parsing [sent. 1624 len. 12]: In any case , there are plenty of village children . ''
Parsing [sent. 1625 len. 7]: `` Not with Jack 's face .
Parsing [sent. 1626 len. 19]: He is sensitive , of course , but he 's not shy ; he 'd enjoy the excitement .
Parsing [sent. 1627 len. 14]: And we should be there ; he could come to no harm . ''
Parsing [sent. 1628 len. 6]: `` And the evening performance ?
Parsing [sent. 1629 len. 12]: Would you propose that he sat up for that also ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1630 len. 11]: Joan pressed her lips together in the struggle for patience .
Parsing [sent. 1631 len. 6]: Really Geoffrey was too bad !
Parsing [sent. 1632 len. 5]: What did he mean ?
Parsing [sent. 1633 len. 5]: What did he want ?
Parsing [sent. 1634 len. 24]: The whole scheme had been planned to give him pleasure , and here he was , silent , disapproving , throwing cold water .
Parsing [sent. 1635 len. 15]: The effort at restraint made her voice sound unnatural even in her own ears .
Parsing [sent. 1636 len. 37]: `` If we had the tableau in the afternoon , it would hardly do to leave it out in the evening -- the only time when the villagers themselves will be able to be present . ''
Parsing [sent. 1637 len. 27]: Before Geoffrey could reply the heel of Pixie 's shoe pressed firmly on his foot beneath the table , and a warning glance silenced his words .
Parsing [sent. 1638 len. 35]: A moment later , when the discussion of pros and cons waxed loud at the far end of the table , she whispered an explanation -- `` Do n't object , do n't argue .
Parsing [sent. 1639 len. 8]: It 's to _ please you _ !
Parsing [sent. 1640 len. 9]: You said she had taken no trouble . ''
Parsing [sent. 1641 len. 15]: Geoffrey Hilliard 's glance of comprehension had in it more of weariness than elation .
Parsing [sent. 1642 len. 26]: Pixie noting the fact , felt a rising of irritation , and mentally dubbed him ungracious and unreasonable , as Esmeralda had done before her .
Parsing [sent. 1643 len. 45]: Both failed to appreciate the fact that sudden spasms of energy were by no means an innovation in the family history , and what the tired man was really longing for was that ordered peace and tranquillity which form the English idea of home .
Parsing [sent. 1644 len. 34]: He made no further objections , however , and Joan threw herself whole-heartedly into her preparations , determined on a success which must win approval as by a _ tour de force _ .
Parsing [sent. 1645 len. 36]: The three days following were far from peaceful , but if the master of the house kept aloof from the stir and bustle , his guests threw themselves into it with every appearance of enjoyment .
Parsing [sent. 1646 len. 30]: Strains of music sounded from the drawing-room and mingled with the tap-tapping of hammers from an upper room where realistic scenery was being manufactured under Joan 's able supervision .
Parsing [sent. 1647 len. 35]: The new system of thoroughness demanded , moreover , that the stored-up cases should be opened , and the contents unpacked , dusted , and re-priced , a work in itself of many hours .
Parsing [sent. 1648 len. 19]: The four guests started thereon with equal vigour , but Honor took an early opportunity of slipping away .
Parsing [sent. 1649 len. 37]: She was tired , she had a headache , she must finish a book , there were half a dozen stock excuses , each one of which seemed to demand an instant adjournment to the garden .
Parsing [sent. 1650 len. 22]: She made the announcement in a high , clear drawl and sailed out of the room without leaving time for protest .
Parsing [sent. 1651 len. 47]: Whereupon Robert Carr attacked the work on hand with feverish zeal , worked like a nigger for five or ten minutes by the clock , and finally bolted out of the door , without , in his case , going through the form of an excuse .
Parsing [sent. 1652 len. 41]: Then the two workers who were left looked out of the window and beheld the truants seated at extreme ends of a garden seat , hardly speaking to each other , looking on the most stiff and formal of terms .
Parsing [sent. 1653 len. 20]: Stanor laughed at the sight , but Pixie 's practical mind could not reconcile itself to such contradictory behaviour .
Parsing [sent. 1654 len. 9]: `` Where 's the sense of it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1655 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 1656 len. 6]: `` Where 's the fun ?
Parsing [sent. 1657 len. 11]: To play truant to sit on a bench and sulk !
Parsing [sent. 1658 len. 25]: Would n't it be far more fun , now , to work up here with nice cheerful people like yourself and -- me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1659 len. 5]: But Stanor knew better .
Parsing [sent. 1660 len. 11]: `` Not a bit of it , '' he returned .
Parsing [sent. 1661 len. 23]: `` They 'd rather quarrel by themselves all day long than be happy with outsiders , even such fascinating people as ourselves .
Parsing [sent. 1662 len. 8]: It 's a symptom of the disease .
Parsing [sent. 1663 len. 19]: Of course , you have grasped the fact that they _ are _ suffering from a disease ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1664 len. 4]: `` I have .
Parsing [sent. 1665 len. 6]: I can use my eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1666 len. 6]: But _ why _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1667 len. 36]: cried Pixie , rounding on him with sudden energy , '' _ why _ , will you tell me , ca n't they be happy and comfortable and get engaged and be done with it ?
Parsing [sent. 1668 len. 32]: What 's the sense of pretending one thing when you mean another , and sulking and quarrelling when you might -- '' `` Quite so , '' assented Stanor , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 1669 len. 16]: `` Odd , is n't it ; but they _ will _ , you know .
Parsing [sent. 1670 len. 16]: Never any knowing what they _ will _ do when it takes them like that .
Parsing [sent. 1671 len. 9]: Besides , in this case there are complications .
Parsing [sent. 1672 len. 18]: Miss Ward has pots of money , and poor old Carr has nothing but what he makes .
Parsing [sent. 1673 len. 33]: He 'll get on all right -- a fellow with that chin is bound to get on -- but it takes time , and meantime it 's a bit of an impasse .
Parsing [sent. 1674 len. 52]: A fellow does n't mind his wife having _ some _ money -- it 's a good thing for her as well as for himself -- but when it comes to a pile like that -- well , if he has any self-respect , he simply ca n't do it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1675 len. 29]: `` If _ I _ had a pile , I 'd expect my lover to accept it from me as gladly as I 'd take it from him .
Parsing [sent. 1676 len. 16]: If he did n't , I should feel he did n't love me enough . ''
Parsing [sent. 1677 len. 7]: `` You 'd be wrong there .
Parsing [sent. 1678 len. 16]: He might love you enough to wish to save you from a jolly uncomfortable position .
Parsing [sent. 1679 len. 14]: It 's not right that a man should be dependent upon his wife .
Parsing [sent. 1680 len. 8]: Puts him in a false position . ''
Parsing [sent. 1681 len. 8]: `` Not if he really loved her .
Parsing [sent. 1682 len. 4]: How could it ?
Parsing [sent. 1683 len. 21]: He 'd realise then that in a life together there would be no ` yours ' or ` mine . '
Parsing [sent. 1684 len. 11]: It would all be ` _ ours _ . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 1685 len. 28]: Stanor lifted his head to look at her , and Pixie 's clear eyes met his in a full frank gaze which held no shadow of embarrassment .
Parsing [sent. 1686 len. 36]: Here was something quite new -- a girl who could speak about love to a young man without a trace of self-consciousness or flirtation , yet with an earnestness which demonstrated a keen personal interest .
Parsing [sent. 1687 len. 35]: Stanor had many girl friends with whom he had often discussed the subject , but invariably a certain amount of self-consciousness had crept in , which had shown itself alternately in cynicism or sentimentality .
Parsing [sent. 1688 len. 36]: Now , to his own amazement , he realised that _ he _ was the one to feel embarrassment , while Pixie confided her sentiments as placidly as if he had been a maiden aunt .
Parsing [sent. 1689 len. 45]: He stared at her as she stood before him , a trim , quaint little figure enveloped in a print overall , beneath which her feet appeared absurdly small and doll-like , and as he looked his heart gave a curious , unexpected leap .
Parsing [sent. 1690 len. 28]: He had felt that leap before , and the meaning of it was no mystery to him , though in this particular instance it was sufficiently astonishing .
Parsing [sent. 1691 len. 43]: Handsome , accomplished , the presumptive heir to a fortune , Stanor Vaughan had been a pet of society for the last half-dozen years , and being by nature susceptible to girlish charm had more than once imagined himself seriously in love .
Parsing [sent. 1692 len. 22]: There had been , for example , that beautiful blonde whose society had turned a summer holiday into a veritable idyll .
Parsing [sent. 1693 len. 50]: He had been on the verge of proposing to her when his uncle had suddenly summoned him home , and -- well , somehow the restless misery of the first few days had disappeared with surprising rapidity , the vision had grown dim , and finally faded from sight .
Parsing [sent. 1694 len. 21]: Again it had been a charming brunette , and this time he had been sure of himself , perfectly sure .
Parsing [sent. 1695 len. 38]: He was awaiting an opportunity to speak when again a summons had arrived , a pleasant one this time , since it took the form of an invitation to accompany his uncle on a prolonged continental tour .
Parsing [sent. 1696 len. 8]: There had been no time to think .
Parsing [sent. 1697 len. 12]: He had barely time to pack his bag and be off .
Parsing [sent. 1698 len. 10]: And at the end of a month , well !
Parsing [sent. 1699 len. 16]: He had begun to hesitate and doubt , and the episode ended like the first .
Parsing [sent. 1700 len. 27]: Curious , when he came to think about it , how the Runkle had in both cases played the part of _ deus ex machina _ .
Parsing [sent. 1701 len. 30]: It was coincidence , of course , pure coincidence , for the old fellow had not known the girls even by name , but it _ was _ odd !
Parsing [sent. 1702 len. 61]: As for his own part in the proceeding , both girls had been unusually charming specimens of the modern society girl , it was natural enough that he should have been impressed , but if it was really the fact that he was falling in love with this Irish Pixie , that was another , and a very different matter .
Parsing [sent. 1703 len. 33]: With a darting thought Stanor recalled his impressions on first meeting the girl a week before , and his own outspoken surprise at the insignificance of the sister of his beautiful hostess .
Parsing [sent. 1704 len. 22]: A plain , odd little creature , that had been the involuntary verdict , but almost immediately it had been amended .
Parsing [sent. 1705 len. 12]: Plain , but charming ; distinctly the little thing had charm !
Parsing [sent. 1706 len. 47]: Now , at the expiration of six days it had come to this , that his eyes no longer noted the faulty outline , but found a continual joy in watching the play of expression , the vivid life and interest of the sparkling little face .
Parsing [sent. 1707 len. 19]: This was the real thing at last , Stanor told himself : it must be the real thing !
Parsing [sent. 1708 len. 17]: Mingled with all his excitement and perturbation , he was conscious of a thrill of self-appreciation .
Parsing [sent. 1709 len. 19]: It was not every man of his age who would put beauty of character before that of feature .
Parsing [sent. 1710 len. 29]: He threw a deliberate _ empressement _ into his gaze , and said meaningly -- `` Your husband , Miss Pixie , will be a lucky man ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1711 len. 10]: `` He will so , '' agreed Pixie warmly .
Parsing [sent. 1712 len. 37]: She gave a soft , musical laugh as if the thought were a pleasant one to dwell on , but Stanor was sensitive enough to realise that his own image played no part in her dreams .
Parsing [sent. 1713 len. 17]: She took up her pen and returned to the scribbling of prices on small paper labels .
Parsing [sent. 1714 len. 9]: `` Russian lace , five shillings a yard .
Parsing [sent. 1715 len. 4]: Russian lacquer collar-box .
Parsing [sent. 1716 len. 8]: Do n't you hate that shiny red ?
Parsing [sent. 1717 len. 17]: Of course , when I talked of fortunes I was only putting myself in her place .
Parsing [sent. 1718 len. 4]: I 've nothing .
Parsing [sent. 1719 len. 5]: None of us have .
Parsing [sent. 1720 len. 15]: When My lover comes , there 'll be only -- _ Me _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1721 len. 22]: The words sounded modest enough , but there was a complacence in the tilt of the head which told another story .
Parsing [sent. 1722 len. 15]: Pixie O'Shaughnessy had no pity to waste on the man who should win herself .
Parsing [sent. 1723 len. 9]: Stanor 's lip twisted in a self-conscious smile .
Parsing [sent. 1724 len. 7]: The other girls had been rich .
Parsing [sent. 1725 len. 45]: He pondered for a moment , and then said suddenly -- `` I wonder , Miss Pixie , with your temperament , and -- er -- under the circumstances that you have not been fired with the modern craze to do something before now .
Parsing [sent. 1726 len. 23]: Girls nowadays do n't seem happy unless they have some work -- '' `` But I _ have _ , I have !
Parsing [sent. 1727 len. 8]: Did you think I was idle ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1728 len. 8]: She looked at him with reproachful eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1729 len. 6]: `` This is a holiday .
Parsing [sent. 1730 len. 32]: I 'm sampling luxury for a change , and I wo n't deny it 's agreeable , but at home all the year I 'm at work from morning to night .
Parsing [sent. 1731 len. 14]: I do n't know how to get _ through _ my work . ''
Parsing [sent. 1732 len. 10]: So she had a profession then , after all !
Parsing [sent. 1733 len. 20]: Stanor felt an amused conviction that whatever the post might be the little thing would fill it uncommonly well .
Parsing [sent. 1734 len. 24]: Small and child-like as she appeared , she yet carried with her that air of assurance which is the heritage of the capable .
Parsing [sent. 1735 len. 47]: It interested him to consider for a moment what particular role she had adopted , and more than one possibility had passed through his head before he put the question into words -- `` And what exactly _ do _ you do , Miss Pixie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1736 len. 6]: She stared at him blankly .
Parsing [sent. 1737 len. 24]: `` Now , if you 'd asked me to say what I do _ not _ do , it would have been easier .
Parsing [sent. 1738 len. 29]: Have you any sort of idea what it means to keep a home going with big ideas and little means , and a cook-general to thwart your efforts ?
Parsing [sent. 1739 len. 10]: If you have , you can imagine the list .
Parsing [sent. 1740 len. 74]: Dusting , sewing , mending , turning , making , _ un _ - making , helping Bridgie , amusing the children , soothing the servants , humouring Dick , making dresses , trimming hats , covering cushions , teaching the alphabet , practising songs , arranging flowers , watering plants , going to shops , making up parcels , writing notes , making -- '' Stanor held up his hands in protest .
Parsing [sent. 1741 len. 3]: `` Stop !
Parsing [sent. 1742 len. 5]: Have pity on me !
Parsing [sent. 1743 len. 5]: What an appalling list !
Parsing [sent. 1744 len. 6]: Is n't it nearly done ?
Parsing [sent. 1745 len. 5]: My ears are deafened !
Parsing [sent. 1746 len. 11]: I am overcome with the thought of such activity ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1747 len. 29]: Nevertheless the smile with which he regarded her was distinctly approving , for , like most men , he preferred domestic women who did not despise home work .
Parsing [sent. 1748 len. 29]: `` I 'll tell you what it is , '' he added warmly , `` Mrs Victor is like the other fellow -- jolly lucky to have you !
Parsing [sent. 1749 len. 17]: There are precious few girls who would give up their whole lives to a sister . ''
Parsing [sent. 1750 len. 8]: `` Bridgie is more than a sister .
Parsing [sent. 1751 len. 15]: She 's meant father and mother and home to me for over ten years .
Parsing [sent. 1752 len. 10]: My parents died when I was so young . ''
Parsing [sent. 1753 len. 4]: `` Like mine .
Parsing [sent. 1754 len. 9]: That 's a point of union between us .
Parsing [sent. 1755 len. 11]: My uncle has played the part of your Bridgie . ''
Parsing [sent. 1756 len. 8]: `` He has ; I know it .
Parsing [sent. 1757 len. 25]: He 's lame , '' answered Pixie swiftly , and was amazed at the heat with which the young fellow replied -- `` Lame ?
Parsing [sent. 1758 len. 4]: Who said so ?
Parsing [sent. 1759 len. 4]: Who told you ?
Parsing [sent. 1760 len. 12]: What does it matter if he _ is _ lame ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1761 len. 5]: `` Not one bit .
Parsing [sent. 1762 len. 6]: I was only -- sorry .
Parsing [sent. 1763 len. 15]: I did n't mean to be unkind or to repeat anything I should n't .
Parsing [sent. 1764 len. 6]: Why are you vexed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1765 len. 15]: He shrugged his shoulders , and snapped the scissors over a coil of string .
Parsing [sent. 1766 len. 5]: `` Oh , nothing .
Parsing [sent. 1767 len. 11]: Gets on one 's nerves a bit that 's all .
Parsing [sent. 1768 len. 24]: He 's such a fine fellow , he would have been such a brick , but that wretched lameness has spoiled it all .
Parsing [sent. 1769 len. 23]: Till he was eighteen he was as strong as a horse -- a fine , upstanding young giant he must have been .
Parsing [sent. 1770 len. 25]: Then came the accident -- pitched from his horse against a stone wall -- and for twelve solid years he lay on his back .
Parsing [sent. 1771 len. 17]: That made him only thirty , but you would never have believed it to see him .
Parsing [sent. 1772 len. 12]: He was a lot more like a man of fifty . ''
Parsing [sent. 1773 len. 17]: Pixie laid her pen on the table , and rested her chin in the clasped hands .
Parsing [sent. 1774 len. 8]: Her eyes looked very large and wistful .
Parsing [sent. 1775 len. 12]: `` Twelve years on one 's back would be pretty long .
Parsing [sent. 1776 len. 17]: One would live so fast _ inside _ all the while one 's body was idle .
Parsing [sent. 1777 len. 5]: ` Twould age you .
Parsing [sent. 1778 len. 25]: If it had happened when he was fifty , ` twould have been easier , but at eighteen one feels so lively and awake .
Parsing [sent. 1779 len. 14]: Anything , _ anything _ would seem better than to do just nothing !
Parsing [sent. 1780 len. 21]: To wake each morning and know there was nothing before one all the long hours , but to lie still !
Parsing [sent. 1781 len. 31]: Other people would get accustomed to it for you -- that would be one of the bits which would hurt the most -- for you 'd never be accustomed yourself .
Parsing [sent. 1782 len. 37]: And which would be worst , do you think -- the days when it was dull and the room was dark , or the days when the sun blazed , begging him to come out ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1783 len. 8]: Stanor shook himself with an involuntary shiver .
Parsing [sent. 1784 len. 5]: `` Do n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1785 len. 4]: he cried sharply .
Parsing [sent. 1786 len. 7]: `` Do n't talk like that !
Parsing [sent. 1787 len. 6]: What an imagination you have !
Parsing [sent. 1788 len. 21]: I 've been enough cut up about it , goodness knows , but I never realised all that it meant .
Parsing [sent. 1789 len. 3]: ... Well !
Parsing [sent. 1790 len. 15]: He is better now , so we need n't grouse about it any more .
Parsing [sent. 1791 len. 11]: It 's only that 's it 's left a mark !
Parsing [sent. 1792 len. 29]: He was turned in a moment from a boy into an old man -- his youth was killed , _ and he ca n't get it back _ !
Parsing [sent. 1793 len. 13]: That 's one reason why he 's so jolly anxious about me .
Parsing [sent. 1794 len. 36]: Like most fellows he sets an exaggerated value on the things he has missed himself , and it 's a craze with him to -- as he calls it -- ` safeguard my youth . '
Parsing [sent. 1795 len. 23]: He is trying to live his own lost days again through me , poor fellow , and it 's a poor game .
Parsing [sent. 1796 len. 15]: Outsiders take for granted that I 'm his heir , but that 's bosh .
Parsing [sent. 1797 len. 9]: Fellows of thirty-five do n't worry about heirs .
Parsing [sent. 1798 len. 36]: He has never mentioned the subject ; all he _ has _ done is to give me every chance in the way of education , and to promise me a good ` start off . '
Parsing [sent. 1799 len. 31]: I 'd have been ready to tackle serious work at once , but he is against a fellow having real responsibility until he 's had time to feel his feet .
Parsing [sent. 1800 len. 29]: I 've had to work , of course -- he 's keen on that ; but he 's keen on recreation , too , and freedom from responsibility .
Parsing [sent. 1801 len. 40]: He believes , poor chap , that if a fellow has freedom between twenty and thirty , he is better fitted to take up responsi -- '' Stanor stopped short suddenly , and the blood rushed to his cheeks .
Parsing [sent. 1802 len. 5]: `` I wonder ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1803 len. 9]: he repeated blankly ; `` I wonder ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1804 len. 35]: For the first time revelation had come home to him with a flash that his uncle 's interference in those two incipient love affairs had not been coincidence , but a deeply matured plan .
Parsing [sent. 1805 len. 31]: He recalled occasions when chance words had betrayed a surprising acquaintance with his own doings , the houses at which he visited , and the feminine members of those households .
Parsing [sent. 1806 len. 12]: Unsuspecting himself , he had doubtless betrayed more than he knew .
Parsing [sent. 1807 len. 18]: In more ways than one his uncle had determined to safeguard his freedom during these early years !
Parsing [sent. 1808 len. 5]: Stanor set his lips .
Parsing [sent. 1809 len. 21]: The discovery was no more pleasant to him than it would be to any other young man of his age .
Parsing [sent. 1810 len. 31]: A certain amount of `` management '' a fellow must be ready to accept from one who had been so generous a friend , but this was going too far .
Parsing [sent. 1811 len. 19]: The Runkle must be shown that in purely personal matters his nephew would allow no one to interfere !
Parsing [sent. 1812 len. 30]: The frown continued for several minutes , but finally gave place to a smile , for a consideration of the present position had led him to a comfortable conclusion .
Parsing [sent. 1813 len. 11]: The Runkle would be on a wrong tack this time !
Parsing [sent. 1814 len. 30]: If he scented any attraction among the members of Mrs Hilliard 's house-party , it would of a certainty be attributed to the pretty American heiress , Honor Ward .
Parsing [sent. 1815 len. 24]: No one would suspect for a moment that the fastidious Stanor Vaughan had been laid captive by a plain and penniless Irish Pixie !
Parsing [sent. 1816 len. 3]: CHAPTER TWELVE .
Parsing [sent. 1817 len. 3]: THE BAZAAR .
Parsing [sent. 1818 len. 25]: The morning of the bazaar was radiantly fine , so that one fear at least was banished from the hearts of the anxious stall-holders .
Parsing [sent. 1819 len. 10]: No excuse now for patrons living at a distance !
Parsing [sent. 1820 len. 10]: No room for written regrets , enclosing minute postal-orders .
Parsing [sent. 1821 len. 21]: Any one who wanted to come , _ could _ come , and woe betide the contents of their purse !
Parsing [sent. 1822 len. 70]: Mrs Hilliard 's stall was placed in the centre of the hall , and in accordance with her own directions had been made in the shape of a great round table , within the hollowed centre of which she and her girl helpers could be protected from the crowd , while without attendant sprites in the persons of the two young men hovered about ready to do their bidding .
Parsing [sent. 1823 len. 34]: Not a single article of needlework appeared upon the stall ; not a solitary pincushion , nor handkerchief sachet , nor nightdress bag , not even so much as an inoffensive tray cloth .
Parsing [sent. 1824 len. 41]: There was pottery from Portugal , and pottery from France , pottery from Switzerland in the shape of jam and marmalade jars , originally purchased for twopence apiece , and offered for sale at an alarming sacrifice for a shilling .
Parsing [sent. 1825 len. 31]: There were beads from Venice , and tiles from Holland , and fans from Spain , and a display of Venetian glass especially provided for the entrapment of county families .
Parsing [sent. 1826 len. 38]: There was dainty English china -LRB- on sale or return -RRB- , and flagons of Eau de Cologne , and white and blue Della Noblia plaques from Florence , and a dozen other dainty and perishable treasures .
Parsing [sent. 1827 len. 4]: `` Everything ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1828 len. 21]: exclaimed Pixie proudly , as she stood with arms akimbo to view the completed stall , `` everything can break !
Parsing [sent. 1829 len. 19]: Not one single thing that you could n't smash in a twinkling , and no bother about it .
Parsing [sent. 1830 len. 21]: It 's what I call a most _ considerate _ stall , the most considerate I 've ever seen ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1831 len. 13]: Esmeralda laughed with complacent understanding , but the two men stared aghast .
Parsing [sent. 1832 len. 20]: `` Is it the object of purchasers to get rid of their purchases as soon as they are made ?
Parsing [sent. 1833 len. 17]: Then why do they bother to -- '' `` It is , and they have to .
Parsing [sent. 1834 len. 33]: It 's expected of them , and they ca n't escape , but you need to be soft-hearted and live in a poor neighbourhood to understand the horror of the bazaar habit .
Parsing [sent. 1835 len. 11]: I 'll tell you a story to the point . ''
Parsing [sent. 1836 len. 12]: Pixie 's eyes danced , she preened herself for prospective enjoyment .
Parsing [sent. 1837 len. 33]: `` There was once a rich old lady , and she sent a pink satin cushion as a contribution to my sister Bridgie 's stall at a military bazaar three years ago .
Parsing [sent. 1838 len. 35]: 'T was a violent pink , with sprays of dog roses and a frill of yellow lace , and not a soul would look at it if they had been paid for the trouble .
Parsing [sent. 1839 len. 42]: 'T was tossed about the stall for two whole days , and on the third , just at the closing , the Colonel 's wife came in with five pounds in her pocket which had arrived by post for the cause .
Parsing [sent. 1840 len. 42]: She wandered about like a lost sheep from one stall to another , looking for anything that would be of any use to anybody in the world , and it was an ageing process to get rid of four pounds five .
Parsing [sent. 1841 len. 4]: Then she stuck .
Parsing [sent. 1842 len. 17]: In the whole room there was not one thing she 'd have been paid to buy .
Parsing [sent. 1843 len. 28]: `` And then 't was Bridgie 's chance , and she beguiled her with the cushion for fifteen shillings , saying the down itself was worth it .
Parsing [sent. 1844 len. 25]: So she bought it to make weight , and sent it to the Major 's wife , with her dear love , for Christmas .
Parsing [sent. 1845 len. 65]: The Major 's wife wore it on the sofa for a whole afternoon when the Colonel 's wife came to tea , and then packed it away in the spare room wardrobe till a young curate brought back a bride , and then she shook it up and ironed the lace and sent it , with all best wishes , for a wedding present .
Parsing [sent. 1846 len. 71]: The curate 's wife wore it for one afternoon , just in the same way , and then _ she _ packed it away , and when Christmas came round she said to her husband that the Colonel 's wife had been so kind and helpful , and would n't it be nice to make a slight return if it were within their means , and what about the cushion ?
Parsing [sent. 1847 len. 36]: So on the very next Christmas the Colonel 's wife got a nice fat parcel , and when it was opened , there , before her eyes -- '' `` Ha , ha ha ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1848 len. 8]: `` Ho , ho , ho ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1849 len. 61]: The two young men anticipated the point with roars of laughter , and Pixie whisked round to the other side of the stall to cock her head at a pyramid of green pottery , and move the principal pieces an inch to the right , a thought to the left , with intent to improve the _ coup d'oeil _ .
Parsing [sent. 1850 len. 45]: To the masculine eye it did not seem possible that such infinitesimal touches could have the slightest effect , but then bazaars are intended primarily for the entrapment of women , and Pixie knew very well that with them first impressions were all important .
Parsing [sent. 1851 len. 23]: Every shopkeeper realises as much , which is the reason why he labels his goods just a farthing beneath the ultimate shilling .
Parsing [sent. 1852 len. 46]: The feminine conscience might possibly shy at paying a whole three shillings for a bauble which could be done without , but , let the eye catch sight of an impressive _ Two _ , and the small eleven three-farthings is swallowed at a gulp !
Parsing [sent. 1853 len. 31]: At two o'clock the bazaar was formally opened in a ceremony which took exactly ten minutes , and was so dull that it appeared to have lasted a long half-hour .
Parsing [sent. 1854 len. 104]: Geoffrey Hilliard , as squire of the village , gave an elaborate explanation of the pressing need of a parish nurse , which his hearers already understood far better than he did himself ; the wife of a neighbouring squire said that she had found a parish nurse a great acquisition in her own village , and she had very much pleasure in declaring the bazaar open , and the vicar returned thanks to the neighbouring squire 's wife for her kindness in `` being present among us to-day , '' and then every one clapped feebly , and the bazaar had begun .
Parsing [sent. 1855 len. 37]: The few county people who were present sauntered round Esmeralda 's stall , bought trophies of china and glass , and promptly whirled away in their motors , feeling that they had nobly discharged a duty .
Parsing [sent. 1856 len. 31]: There was no denying the fact that it was a dull occasion , and an arduous one into the bargain for sales-women who wanted to get rid of their wares .
Parsing [sent. 1857 len. 40]: The hall was sparsely filled , and the good ladies who were present had come with a certain amount of money in their purses , and a fixed idea of the manner in which they intended to spend it .
Parsing [sent. 1858 len. 67]: They would pay for admission , they would pay for tea , they would pay for the concert -- conceivably they might even indulge in a second tea -- they would purchase buttonholes of hot-house flowers , patronise side shows , and possibly expend a few shillings at the grocery stall -LRB- `` Should have to buy them in any case , my dear ! '' -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 1859 len. 12]: but there the list of their expenditure came to an end .
Parsing [sent. 1860 len. 55]: Even when Honor and Pixie were driven out of their fastness , and walked boldly to and fro , hawking tempting selections from the stall , they met with but little success , for if there is no money left in the purse , the best will in the world can not produce it .
Parsing [sent. 1861 len. 19]: `` Would n't you like to buy this lovely little plaque of Della Robbia , from Florence ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1862 len. 10]: inquired Pixie genially of a group of portly matrons .
Parsing [sent. 1863 len. 7]: `` Reduced to seven and six .
Parsing [sent. 1864 len. 9]: Ten shillings at the beginning of the afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 1865 len. 6]: Less than cost price ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1866 len. 5]: `` Very pretty ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1867 len. 23]: murmured the ladies , and the portliest of them went a step further and added : '' _ And _ cheap ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1868 len. 10]: but no one showed the faintest disposition to buy .
Parsing [sent. 1869 len. 15]: `` It would look so well in the dark corner of the drawing-room ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1870 len. 20]: suggested Pixie , drawing a bow at a venture , and the three faces instantly became thoughtful and intent .
Parsing [sent. 1871 len. 5]: `` That 's true .
Parsing [sent. 1872 len. 5]: It might do that .
Parsing [sent. 1873 len. 5]: Does it hang ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1874 len. 29]: `` It is made to hang , '' Pixie exhibited the holes pierced in the china , `` but I should _ prefer _ it on a bracket !
Parsing [sent. 1875 len. 32]: A bracket nailed across a corner at just the right height , and the plaque put across it , so that you could see it from all parts of the room .
Parsing [sent. 1876 len. 7]: -- Is your drawing-room blue ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1877 len. 5]: `` Pale blue . ''
Parsing [sent. 1878 len. 4]: `` How charming !
Parsing [sent. 1879 len. 10]: It would just set off this darker shade . ''
Parsing [sent. 1880 len. 6]: `` Mine is not blue .
Parsing [sent. 1881 len. 5]: It is pink . ''
Parsing [sent. 1882 len. 7]: `` But think of the contrast !
Parsing [sent. 1883 len. 4]: Blue and pink !
Parsing [sent. 1884 len. 5]: What could be sweeter ?
Parsing [sent. 1885 len. 8]: It would look perfect against your walls !
Parsing [sent. 1886 len. 10]: Shall I make it up safely in a box ?
Parsing [sent. 1887 len. 8]: We have a special parcels department . ''
Parsing [sent. 1888 len. 16]: `` Not to-day , thank you , '' said the owner of the blue drawing-room .
Parsing [sent. 1889 len. 15]: `` I 'll think of it , '' said the owner of the pink .
Parsing [sent. 1890 len. 14]: The silent third asked tentatively : `` Could you make it five ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1891 len. 8]: The next group were more hopeless still .
Parsing [sent. 1892 len. 7]: They did n't like Della Robbia .
Parsing [sent. 1893 len. 12]: Common , they called it , that bright yellow and blue .
Parsing [sent. 1894 len. 16]: Pixie was informed that if she offered the plaque for nothing it would be declined .
Parsing [sent. 1895 len. 30]: She carried it dejectedly back to the stall , piled a tray with marmalade jars , gave it to Stanor to carry , and started off on another promenade .
Parsing [sent. 1896 len. 4]: `` Marmalade jars !
Parsing [sent. 1897 len. 4]: Fine marmalade jars !
Parsing [sent. 1898 len. 8]: Who will buy my marmalade jars ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1899 len. 63]: chanted the young man loudly , and the audience giggled , and listened with indulgent looks , even went so far as to finger the jars themselves , admire the design , and marvel how they could have been made for the price , but not a single one of the number had a vacancy for such an article in the home .
Parsing [sent. 1900 len. 76]: Even when Stanor suggested that the jars were not dedicated to marmalade alone , but might be used for jam , for honey , for syrup , the supply seemed ridiculously out of proportion to the demand , and half an hour 's exercise of his own pleading , seconded by Pixie 's beguilements , brought in a total result of three shillings , which , to say the least of it , seemed inadequate .
Parsing [sent. 1901 len. 20]: `` At this rate , '' said Esmeralda , `` we shall have a van-load to take home ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1902 len. 26]: Honor , seated dejectedly on an inverted packing-chest , discoursed in a thin , monotonous tone on the glories of charity sales in the States .
Parsing [sent. 1903 len. 28]: They were always crowded , it appeared ; policemen stood at the doors to prevent a crush ; the buying was in the nature of a competition .
Parsing [sent. 1904 len. 32]: Young girls offering wares for sale found themselves surrounded by throngs of millionaires , bidding against each other for the privilege of obtaining any article which she was pleased to offer .
Parsing [sent. 1905 len. 29]: Having accomplished a purchase , it became the overwhelming desire of the purchaser to present the article in question as a votive offering to the fair sales-woman herself .
Parsing [sent. 1906 len. 12]: ... Such a recital was hardly calculative to enliven the occasion .
Parsing [sent. 1907 len. 25]: Esmeralda frowned , and Pixie sighed , and for the first time in her existence doubted the entire superiority of being born a Briton .
Parsing [sent. 1908 len. 16]: She remembered her rebuffs with the Della Robbia plaque and thought wistfully of those millionaires !
Parsing [sent. 1909 len. 34]: The concert , however , was a success : the room was filled , the audience was appreciative , and lovely little Jack in the character of an invalid evoked storms of applause .
Parsing [sent. 1910 len. 41]: The spirits of the performers were improved by their success , but as the audience now cleared off rapidly on dinner intent , there seemed no reason why Geoffrey , Stanor , and Robert Carr should not follow their example .
Parsing [sent. 1911 len. 21]: The suggestion was made , Esmeralda vouchsafed a gracious permission , and went off herself to parley with another stall-holder .
Parsing [sent. 1912 len. 29]: The three men made for the door , with relief written on every line of their figures , and the two girls remained on duty seated on packing-cases .
Parsing [sent. 1913 len. 38]: `` At home in the States , '' remarked Honor severely , `` the men would not be _ paid _ to run off home to dine in comfort , leaving the girls alone to work . ''
Parsing [sent. 1914 len. 5]: `` On sandwiches ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1915 len. 10]: supplemented Pixie sadly , `` and stewed tea ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1916 len. 13]: She was hungry herself , and could have appreciated a well-cooked meal .
Parsing [sent. 1917 len. 14]: `` I 'd like to know some American men , '' she opined .
Parsing [sent. 1918 len. 27]: `` You must be longing to get back to them , as they are so much more appreciative and polite than our men over here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1919 len. 13]: Honor blushed , and regarded the points of her neat little shoes .
Parsing [sent. 1920 len. 38]: `` There are a great many things , Pat-ricia , '' she said slowly , `` that a girl ought to do if she were logical , and consistent , and acted up to what she preached .
Parsing [sent. 1921 len. 10]: But she is n't , and she do n't .
Parsing [sent. 1922 len. 56]: I 'm not in a mite of a hurry to get back ... '' ------------------------------------------------------------------------ The hall was packed to overflowing for the evening concert , additional chairs were placed down the aisles , and even after they were filled , a number of people had to be content with standing places at the back .
Parsing [sent. 1923 len. 38]: The performers peeping round the corner of the stage felt a mingling of nervousness and excitement , and vociferously instructed every one else to pull his or her self together , and do his or her best .
Parsing [sent. 1924 len. 34]: It soon became apparent , however , that the audience was indulgent to the point of boredom , applauding with consistency each item , good or bad , and demanding thereto an encore .
Parsing [sent. 1925 len. 29]: Esmeralda 's entrance brought down the house , Pixie 's Irish ditties evoked shouts of applause , and the part songs but narrowly escaped being turned into choruses .
Parsing [sent. 1926 len. 37]: It was , indeed , a village audience of the old-fashioned kind , assembled together in pleasant , friendly spirit , with the object of being amused , and determined that that object should be fulfilled .
Parsing [sent. 1927 len. 33]: The squire was a favourite , as he well deserved to be , and his beautiful wife was regarded with a fervent admiration , which her very aloofness had served to heighten .
Parsing [sent. 1928 len. 31]: Other ladies might call round at cottage doors , and talk intimately concerning book clubs , and Dorcas societies , but no one expected such condescension from Mrs Geoffrey Hilliard .
Parsing [sent. 1929 len. 36]: She whizzed along in her great green car , or cantered past on her tall brown horse , followed by a groom in livery , vouchsafing a gracious smile in return for bows and curtseys .
Parsing [sent. 1930 len. 17]: On Sundays she sat ensconced in the great square pew , a vision of stately beauty .
Parsing [sent. 1931 len. 51]: ... The good dames of the village felt it the great privilege of this evening to see the squire 's lady without her hat , with diamonds flashing at her throat , smiling , laughing , singing -- a goddess descended from her pedestal to make merry on their behalf .
Parsing [sent. 1932 len. 44]: And so at last in the midst of this simple happiness came the time for the last item on the programme -- that double tableau which every person in the hall was fated to remember , to the last day of his life !
Parsing [sent. 1933 len. 3]: CHAPTER THIRTEEN .
Parsing [sent. 1934 len. 3]: THE ACCIDENT .
Parsing [sent. 1935 len. 9]: The curtain drew up on the first tableau .
Parsing [sent. 1936 len. 39]: Joan sang appropriate words in the sweetest tones of her rich contralto voice , her eyes , like those of the audience , riveted on the face of the little invalid as he lay on his truckle bed .
Parsing [sent. 1937 len. 16]: White-cheeked , bandaged , reclining , the transformation in the child 's appearance was astounding .
Parsing [sent. 1938 len. 29]: Considered as a piece of stage-craft , Joan had every reason to congratulate herself on the result , but the mother 's heart felt a pang of dismay .
Parsing [sent. 1939 len. 6]: The representation was too life-like !
Parsing [sent. 1940 len. 15]: Just so would the darling look if the illness were real , not imaginary .
Parsing [sent. 1941 len. 10]: In the afternoon he had not looked so ghastly .
Parsing [sent. 1942 len. 10]: Was the double excitement too much for his strength ?
Parsing [sent. 1943 len. 21]: Joan 's eyes turned from the stage to the first row of seats , where her husband had his place .
Parsing [sent. 1944 len. 13]: Geoffrey looked worried ; his brows contracted as he watched his son .
Parsing [sent. 1945 len. 13]: Unconsciously Joan quickened the pace of the last verse of her song .
Parsing [sent. 1946 len. 22]: She was anxious to get to the second tableau , to see Jack sitting up , smiling , his eyes alert .
Parsing [sent. 1947 len. 4]: The curtain fell .
Parsing [sent. 1948 len. 12]: A low murmur from the audience swelled into somewhat forced applause .
Parsing [sent. 1949 len. 17]: The villagers also , Joan realised , had felt the scene to be almost too realistic .
Parsing [sent. 1950 len. 26]: Behind the scenes Honor as nurse and Pixie as mother propped the child 's back with cushions , and showered kisses on his white cheeks .
Parsing [sent. 1951 len. 8]: `` Smile , Jackey , smile ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1952 len. 3]: they cried .
Parsing [sent. 1953 len. 21]: `` Now you are a getting-well boy , and all the people will see you , and be so pleased !
Parsing [sent. 1954 len. 21]: Just once more , darling , and then away we go , driving off home to supper in the car .
Parsing [sent. 1955 len. 6]: Now a big smile ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1956 len. 4]: The curtain rose .
Parsing [sent. 1957 len. 18]: Jack smiled his sweet , baby smile , and the audience burst into cheers of hearty relief .
Parsing [sent. 1958 len. 24]: Every one was smiling -- not only the invalid , but also the mother , the father , the neat , complacent nurse .
Parsing [sent. 1959 len. 8]: Esmeralda 's voice swelled in glad content .
Parsing [sent. 1960 len. 21]: That last scene had been horrible ; never , never again would she attempt to simulate so dreadful a reality !
Parsing [sent. 1961 len. 13]: What a comfort to see the darling once more bonnie and smiling .
Parsing [sent. 1962 len. 12]: Half an hour more and he would be safe in bed .
Parsing [sent. 1963 len. 46]: The curtain fell , was lifted again in response to a storm of applause , the piano strummed out the first bars of `` God Save the King , '' and the audience , stumbling to their feet , began to join in the strain .
Parsing [sent. 1964 len. 44]: Suddenly , startlingly , a shriek rent the air , rising shrill above the heavy chorus of voices -- the piercing , treble shrieks of a young child , followed by loud cries for help and a stampede of feet behind the curtain .
Parsing [sent. 1965 len. 4]: The music ceased .
Parsing [sent. 1966 len. 48]: Geoffrey Hilliard and his wife rushed with one accord up the steps leading to the platform , the village doctor edged his way hurriedly through the crowded hall , the real parish nurse , wearing for the first time her new uniform , followed in his wake .
Parsing [sent. 1967 len. 13]: And still the treble shrieks continued -- the terrible , childish shrieks .
Parsing [sent. 1968 len. 10]: The women in the audience shivered and turned pale .
Parsing [sent. 1969 len. 5]: _ Master Jack _ !
Parsing [sent. 1970 len. 12]: And only a moment before he had been playing at sickness .
Parsing [sent. 1971 len. 8]: It was ill-work trifling with serious things .
Parsing [sent. 1972 len. 4]: The pretty lamb !
Parsing [sent. 1973 len. 5]: What could have happened ?
Parsing [sent. 1974 len. 19]: Behind the curtain all was horror and confusion , a ghastly nightmare exaggeration of the scene just depicted .
Parsing [sent. 1975 len. 27]: There on the same bed lay Jack , writhing in torture , the bandages charred and blackened , a terrible smell of burning in the air .
Parsing [sent. 1976 len. 24]: Bending over him in torment stood the real father and mother ; coming forward with calm , capable help came the veritable nurse .
Parsing [sent. 1977 len. 5]: How had it happened ?
Parsing [sent. 1978 len. 2]: How ?
Parsing [sent. 1979 len. 17]: By what terrible lapse of care had the precious child been allowed to fall into danger ?
Parsing [sent. 1980 len. 23]: The mother 's glance was fierce in its wrath and despair , but the explanation when it came was but too simple .
Parsing [sent. 1981 len. 21]: Jack had been bidden to sit still in bed until his clothes should be brought ; from the adjoining dressing-room .
Parsing [sent. 1982 len. 26]: But for a moment Pixie had left his side , but in that moment a child-like impatience and restlessness had asserted itself with fatal consequences .
Parsing [sent. 1983 len. 52]: Jack had leapt up , rushed to the table , clutched at a glass of milk placed ready for his own refreshment , and in so doing had brought his bandaged head across the flame of an open candle , one of the small `` properties '' of the cottage scene .
Parsing [sent. 1984 len. 43]: In an instant he was in flames ; he threw up his little arm and the sleeve of the nightshirt caught the blaze ; he ran shrieking to and fro , dodging pursuit , fighting , struggling , refusing to be held .
Parsing [sent. 1985 len. 48]: For a moment the beholders had been too aghast for action ; then Pixie leapt for the blankets , while Stanor overtook the child , tripped him up , wrapped and pressed and wrapped again ; unfolded with trembling hands -- It was no one 's fault .
Parsing [sent. 1986 len. 6]: No one could be blamed .
Parsing [sent. 1987 len. 15]: Jack was old enough to understand and obey , was proverbially docile and obedient .
Parsing [sent. 1988 len. 15]: Under the same circumstances at home he would have been left without a qualm .
Parsing [sent. 1989 len. 13]: The unusual circumstances had created an unusual restlessness not to be anticipated .
Parsing [sent. 1990 len. 39]: Even at that bitter moment Joan realised that if it was a question of blame , she herself was at fault in having allowed the child to take part in the tableau against her husband 's better judgment .
Parsing [sent. 1991 len. 29]: A smaller nature might have found relief in scattering blame wholesale , but there was a generosity in Irish Esmeralda 's nature which lifted her above the temptation .
Parsing [sent. 1992 len. 22]: In the midst of her anguish she spared a moment to comfort Pixie by a breathless `` Not your fault ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1993 len. 14]: before she became unconscious of everything but the moaning figure on the bed .
Parsing [sent. 1994 len. 12]: The treatment of Jack 's burns was completed with praiseworthy expedition .
Parsing [sent. 1995 len. 24]: The local chemist flew on winged feet to his shop in the village street , whence he brought back all that was required .
Parsing [sent. 1996 len. 110]: Nurse and doctor sent away the relatives , and worked with swift , tender fingers ; and presently a swathed , motionless figure was carried out to an impromptu ambulance , fitted up inside the great car , while the late audience stood massed together in the street , looking on silent and motionless -- silent as to speech , but from every heart in that crowd went up a cry to God , and every mother in the village knelt that night beside her bed and prayed with tears for the life of little Jack Hilliard , and for the support and comfort of his father and mother .
Parsing [sent. 1997 len. 39]: ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Jack lay motionless in the darkened room , a tiny form outlined beneath the bedclothes ; on the pillow was a swathe of bandages , with barely an inch between to show the small , scarred face .
Parsing [sent. 1998 len. 46]: The night before , with tossing curls , flushed cheeks , and curving coral lips , he had lain a picture of childish beauty , at sight of which his parents ' hearts had glowed with tenderness and pride as they paid their good-night visit .
Parsing [sent. 1999 len. 5]: `` He looks flushed .
Parsing [sent. 2000 len. 6]: All this rehearsing is exciting .
Parsing [sent. 2001 len. 29]: I shall be glad when the tableaux are over , '' Geoffrey had said , and Joan had whispered back ardently -- `` But so _ lovely _ !
Parsing [sent. 2002 len. 8]: If he looks like that to-morrow ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2003 len. 43]: And this was to-morrow ; and there on the bed lay Jack , shorn , blinded , tortured -- a marble image that moaned , and moaned ... Through the night telephone and telegraph had been busy summoning the most skilful aid .
Parsing [sent. 2004 len. 19]: Here at least was one blessing of wealth -- that the question of expense need never be considered .
Parsing [sent. 2005 len. 35]: This man for eyes , that man for skin , a third for shock to the nerves ; the cleverest nurses , the newest appliances -- the wonderful wires summoned them each in turn .
Parsing [sent. 2006 len. 36]: Throughout the night motor-cars whirled up the drive , tall men in top coats , nurses in cloaks and bonnets , dismantled and passed into the house , mysterious cases were hurried up back stairways .
Parsing [sent. 2007 len. 19]: Joan and her husband were banished from the sickroom , and sat in her boudoir awaiting the verdict .
Parsing [sent. 2008 len. 31]: It was the first time they had been alone together since the accident , and when the door closed behind them Joan glanced at her husband with a quivering fear .
Parsing [sent. 2009 len. 7]: His face was white and drawn .
Parsing [sent. 2010 len. 19]: He looked old , and bowed , and broken , but there was no anger in his face .
Parsing [sent. 2011 len. 3]: `` Geoffrey !
Parsing [sent. 2012 len. 7]: Will you ever forgive me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2013 len. 9]: For all answer he held out his arms .
Parsing [sent. 2014 len. 33]: The old look of love was in his eyes , the old beautiful softness ; there was no bitterness in his look , no anger , not the faintest shadow of blame .
Parsing [sent. 2015 len. 6]: `` Dearest , do n't !
Parsing [sent. 2016 len. 4]: We both suffer .
Parsing [sent. 2017 len. 5]: We must keep strong .
Parsing [sent. 2018 len. 7]: We must help each other . ''
Parsing [sent. 2019 len. 7]: `` Geoff , you warned me .
Parsing [sent. 2020 len. 7]: You said it would be bad .
Parsing [sent. 2021 len. 12]: It was against your wish ... It 's my fault ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2022 len. 12]: `` Darling , darling , do n't make it worse ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2023 len. 13]: He pressed her head against his shoulder with tender , soothing touches .
Parsing [sent. 2024 len. 7]: `` No one could have foreseen .
Parsing [sent. 2025 len. 13]: I feared for excitement only ; there was no thought of danger .
Parsing [sent. 2026 len. 8]: We have enough to bear , sweetheart .
Parsing [sent. 2027 len. 7]: Do n't torture yourself needlessly . ''
Parsing [sent. 2028 len. 16]: `` It 's my doing , it 's my punishment ; I brought it about .
Parsing [sent. 2029 len. 11]: I 've been cold , and selfish , and ungrateful .
Parsing [sent. 2030 len. 22]: I had so much I ought to have been so thankful , but I was discontented -- I made you wretched .
Parsing [sent. 2031 len. 44]: God gave me a chance -- '' she pushed him away with frenzied hands and paced wildly , up and down the room -- `` a chance of salvation by happiness , and I was too mean , too poor to take it .
Parsing [sent. 2032 len. 17]: Geoff , do you remember that poem of Stevenson 's , ` The Celestial Surgeon ' ?
Parsing [sent. 2033 len. 18]: They have been rinking in my head all night , those last lines , those dreadful lines .
Parsing [sent. 2034 len. 8]: I _ was _ ` obdurate . '
Parsing [sent. 2035 len. 33]: All the blessings which had been showered upon me left me dead ; it needed this ` darting pain ' to ` _ stab my dead heart wide awake _ ! ' ''
Parsing [sent. 2036 len. 20]: She repeated the words with an emphasis , a wildness which brought an additional furrow into Geoffrey 's brow .
Parsing [sent. 2037 len. 13]: He sighed heavily and sank down on a corner of the sofa .
Parsing [sent. 2038 len. 22]: All night long body and mind had been on the rack ; he was chill , faint , wearied to death .
Parsing [sent. 2039 len. 43]: The prospect of another hysterical scene was almost more than he could endure , yet through all his heart yearned over his wife , for he realised that , great as was his own sorrow , hers was still harder to bear .
Parsing [sent. 2040 len. 52]: He might reason with her till doomsday , he might prove over and again that for the night 's catastrophe she was as free from blame as himself , yet Esmeralda , being Esmeralda , would turn her back on reason and persist in turning the knife in her own wound .
Parsing [sent. 2041 len. 43]: Speech failed him ; but the voiceless prayer of his heart found an answer , for no words that he could have spoken could have appealed to his wife 's heart as did his silence and the helpless sorrow of his face .
Parsing [sent. 2042 len. 20]: She came running to him , fell at his feet , and laid her beautiful head upon his knee .
Parsing [sent. 2043 len. 15]: `` Geoff , it 's so hard , for I _ was _ trying !
Parsing [sent. 2044 len. 13]: In my own foolish way I was trying to please , you .
Parsing [sent. 2045 len. 22]: I may have been hasty , I may have been rash , but I _ did _ mean to do right .
Parsing [sent. 2046 len. 5]: -- I did try !
Parsing [sent. 2047 len. 15]: I 've loved you all the time , Geoff , but I was spoiled .
Parsing [sent. 2048 len. 7]: You were too good to me .
Parsing [sent. 2049 len. 10]: My nature was not fine enough to stand it .
Parsing [sent. 2050 len. 8]: I _ presumed _ on your love .
Parsing [sent. 2051 len. 6]: I imagined , vain fool !
Parsing [sent. 2052 len. 13]: that nothing could kill it , and then you opened my eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2053 len. 12]: _ You _ said yourself that I had worn you out .
Parsing [sent. 2054 len. 15]: -- It killed me , Geoff , to think you had grown tired ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2055 len. 11]: `` Joan , darling , let 's forget all that .
Parsing [sent. 2056 len. 39]: I 've been at fault too ; there were faults on both sides , but we have _ always _ loved each other ; the love was there just as surely as the sun is behind the clouds .
Parsing [sent. 2057 len. 19]: And now ... we _ need _ our love ... I -- I 'm worn out , dear .
Parsing [sent. 2058 len. 11]: I ca n't go through this if you fail me .
Parsing [sent. 2059 len. 7]: Bury the past , forget it .
Parsing [sent. 2060 len. 17]: You are my wife , I am your husband -- we _ need _ each other .
Parsing [sent. 2061 len. 5]: Our little child ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2062 len. 6]: They clung together , weeping .
Parsing [sent. 2063 len. 17]: In each mind was a great o'ershadowing dread , but the dread was not the same .
Parsing [sent. 2064 len. 13]: The father asked of himself -- Would the boy _ die _ ?
Parsing [sent. 2065 len. 13]: The mother -- Would he live , blinded , maimed , crippled ?
Parsing [sent. 2066 len. 12]: The door opened , a small face peered in and withdrew .
Parsing [sent. 2067 len. 20]: Pixie had seen the entwined arms , the heads pressed together , and realised that she was not needed .
Parsing [sent. 2068 len. 12]: She crept away , and sat alone watching the slow dawn .
Parsing [sent. 2069 len. 12]: The verdict of the specialists brought no lessening of the strain .
Parsing [sent. 2070 len. 22]: It was too soon to judge ; the shock was severe , and it was a question of strength holding out .
Parsing [sent. 2071 len. 8]: Too soon to talk about the eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2072 len. 5]: That must be left .
Parsing [sent. 2073 len. 23]: There were injuries , no doubt , but in the present condition of inflammation and collapse it was only possible to wait .
Parsing [sent. 2074 len. 21]: And to wait was , to the distracted mother , the most unbearable torture she could have had to endure .
Parsing [sent. 2075 len. 37]: The great house was quiet as the grave ; the three guests had departed , little Geoff had been carried away by the vicar 's wife to the refuge of her own full , healthful nursery .
Parsing [sent. 2076 len. 42]: The boy was shocked and silenced by the thought of his brother 's danger , but at five years of age a continuance of grief is as little to be expected as desired , and nothing could be left to chance .
Parsing [sent. 2077 len. 20]: A cry beneath the window , a sudden , unexpected noise might be sufficient to turn the frail balance .
Parsing [sent. 2078 len. 17]: Pixie was alone , more helplessly , achingly alone than she had been in her life .
Parsing [sent. 2079 len. 10]: The doors of the sickroom were closed against her .
Parsing [sent. 2080 len. 7]: Joan had no need of her .
Parsing [sent. 2081 len. 13]: Joan wanted Geoffrey -- Geoffrey , only -- Geoffrey alone to herself .
Parsing [sent. 2082 len. 9]: Even Bridgie 's telegraphed offer had been refused .
Parsing [sent. 2083 len. 4]: `` Not now !
Parsing [sent. 2084 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 2085 len. 25]: Do n't let her come -- later on , '' Esmeralda said , and turned restlessly away , impatient even of the slight interruption .
Parsing [sent. 2086 len. 49]: If it had been an ordinary , middle-class house , wherein sudden illness brings so much strain and upset , Pixie would have expended herself in service , and have found comfort in so doing , but in the great ordered house all moved like a well-oiled machine .
Parsing [sent. 2087 len. 26]: Meals appeared on the table at the ordinary hours , were carried away untouched , to be replaced by others equally tempting , equally futile .
Parsing [sent. 2088 len. 72]: Banks of flowers bloomed in the empty rooms , servants flitted about their duties ; there was no stir , no stress , no overwork , no need at all for a poor little sister-in-law ; nothing for her to do but wander disconsolately from room to room , from garden to garden , to weep alone , and pour out her tender heart in a passion of love and prayer .
Parsing [sent. 2089 len. 17]: `` Christ , there are so many little boys in your heaven -- leave us Jack !
Parsing [sent. 2090 len. 7]: God , have pity on Esmeralda !
Parsing [sent. 2091 len. 5]: She 's his mother .
Parsing [sent. 2092 len. 12]: ... _ Her beloved son ... Must he go _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2093 len. 8]: The silent house felt like a prison .
Parsing [sent. 2094 len. 12]: Pixie opened a side door and crept out into the garden .
Parsing [sent. 2095 len. 36]: The sun was shining cloudlessly , the scent of flowers hung on the air , the birds sang blithely overhead ; to a sorrowful heart there seemed something almost brutal in this indifference of Nature .
Parsing [sent. 2096 len. 20]: How could the sun shine when a little innocent human soul lay suffering cruel torture in that upper room ?
Parsing [sent. 2097 len. 28]: Pixie made her way to her favourite seat at the end of a long , straight path , bordered on each side by square-cut hedges of yew .
Parsing [sent. 2098 len. 50]: On the north side the great bush had grown to a height of eight or ten feet , with a width almost as great ; on the southern side the hedge was kept trimmed to a level of four feet , to allow a view of the sloping park .
Parsing [sent. 2099 len. 69]: For two hundred yards the path lay straight as a die between those grand old hedges ; occasionally a peacock strutted proudly along its length , trailing its tail over the gravel , and then the final touch of picturesqueness was given to the scene , but even the approach of an ordinary humdrum human had an effect of dignity , of importance , in such old-world surroundings .
Parsing [sent. 2100 len. 55]: It gratified Pixie 's keen sense of what it dramatically termed `` a situation '' to place herself in this point of vantage and act the part of audience ; and to-day , though no one more interesting than a gardener was likely to appear , she yet made instinctively for the accustomed place .
Parsing [sent. 2101 len. 35]: The sombre green of the yew was more in accord with her mood than the riot of blossom in the gardens beyond , and she was out of sight of those terrible upper windows .
Parsing [sent. 2102 len. 31]: At any moment , as it seemed , a hand from within might stretch out to lower those blinds ... Could one live through the moment that saw them fall ?
Parsing [sent. 2103 len. 19]: Pixie leaned back in her seat , and lived dreamily over the happenings of the last three days .
Parsing [sent. 2104 len. 39]: The morning after the accident the three visitors had made haste to pack , and depart in different directions -- Honor and Robert Carr to town , Stanor Vaughan to friends at the other side of the county .
Parsing [sent. 2105 len. 38]: Honor had relied on Robert 's escort , but he had hurried off by the nine o'clock train , excusing himself on the score of urgent business , which fact added largely to the girl 's depression .
Parsing [sent. 2106 len. 6]: It was four , o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 2107 len. 32]: All day long Pixie had been alone , unneeded , unobserved , for Joan refused to leave the nursery floor , even for meals , and Geoffrey remained by her side .
Parsing [sent. 2108 len. 27]: Looking back over the whole course of her life , the girl could not remember a time when she had been so utterly thrown on herself .
Parsing [sent. 2109 len. 17]: Always there had been some one at hand to love , to pity , to demand .
Parsing [sent. 2110 len. 55]: At school , at the time of her father 's death , there had been a bevy of dear girl friends -- saintly Margaret , spectacled Kate , Clara of the high forehead and long upper lip , Lottie , pretty and clever , each vieing with the other to minister to her needs .
Parsing [sent. 2111 len. 11]: Pixie followed in thought the history of each old friend .
Parsing [sent. 2112 len. 39]: Margaret had become a missionary and had sailed for far-off China , Clara was mistress in a High School , Lottie lived in India , married to a soldier husband , Kate was domiciled as governess in Scotland .
Parsing [sent. 2113 len. 14]: All were far away , all engrossed in new interests , new surroundings .
Parsing [sent. 2114 len. 35]: Later on , in Pixie 's own life , a lonely time had come when she had been sent to Paris , to finish her education in the home of the dear school Mademoiselle .
Parsing [sent. 2115 len. 24]: She had been lonely then , it is true -- homesick , homeland-sick , so sick that she had even contemplated running away .
Parsing [sent. 2116 len. 31]: But how good they had been to her ; -- Mademoiselle and her dear old father -- how wise , how tactful , above all , how _ kind _ !
Parsing [sent. 2117 len. 57]: Monsieur had died a few years before and gone to his last `` repose , '' and Mademoiselle -- marvellous and incredible fact -- Mademoiselle had married a grey-bearded , bald-headed personage whom her English visitor had mentally classed as a contemporary of '' _ mon pere _ '' and tottering on the verge of dotage .
Parsing [sent. 2118 len. 26]: It appeared , however , by after accounts , that he was barely fifty , which Dick Victor insisted was an age of comparative vigour .
Parsing [sent. 2119 len. 7]: `` Quite a suitable match ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2120 len. 12]: he had pronounced it , but Pixie obstinately withheld her approval .
Parsing [sent. 2121 len. 53]: Mademoiselle , as mademoiselle , would have been a regular visitor for life ; Madame , the wife of a husband exigent in disposition , and deeply distrustful of '' _ le mer _ '' must perforce stay dutifully at home in Paris , and was therefore lost to her English friends .
Parsing [sent. 2122 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 2123 len. 8]: The years -- what changes they brought !
Parsing [sent. 2124 len. 5]: What toll they demanded !
Parsing [sent. 2125 len. 15]: So many friends lost to sight , drifted afar by the stream of life .
Parsing [sent. 2126 len. 10]: So many changes , so _ many _ breaks .
Parsing [sent. 2127 len. 9]: _ What would the years bring next _ ?
Parsing [sent. 2128 len. 54]: Pixie shut her eyes and leaned back in her seat , and being young , and sad , and faint , and hungry , and very , very tired , Mother Nature came to her aid , and laying gentle fingers on the closed lids sealed them in sleep , her kindliest gift .
Parsing [sent. 2129 len. 31]: Pixie slept , and round the corner of this straight green hedge fate came marching towards her , with footsteps growing momentarily louder , and louder upon the gravel path .
Parsing [sent. 2130 len. 3]: CHAPTER FOURTEEN .
Parsing [sent. 2131 len. 5]: A PROPOSAL OF MARRIAGE .
Parsing [sent. 2132 len. 21]: Stanor Vaughan stood with his hands thrust deep into his pockets looking down upon Pixie 's pale , unconscious face .
Parsing [sent. 2133 len. 42]: He had motored thirty miles to hear the latest news of the little patient -- that was certainly _ one _ reason of his visit ; but a second had undoubtedly been to see once more the little patient 's aunt !
Parsing [sent. 2134 len. 40]: At the house he had been informed that Miss O'Shaughnessy was in the garden , and had tracked her without difficulty to her favourite seat , and now there she lay , poor , sweet , tired little soul !
Parsing [sent. 2135 len. 27]: With her head tilted back against the hedge , and the wee mites of hands crossed upon her lap -- an image of weariness and dejection .
Parsing [sent. 2136 len. 22]: Stanor Vaughan felt within him the stirrings of tenderness and pity with which a strong man regards weakness in any form .
Parsing [sent. 2137 len. 20]: Pixie was by nature such a jaunty little thing that it seemed doubly pathetic to see her so reduced .
Parsing [sent. 2138 len. 21]: A fellow wanted to take her up in his arms , and comfort her , and make her smile again .
Parsing [sent. 2139 len. 19]: A flush rose in Stanor 's cheeks as he recalled an incident of the night of the accident .
Parsing [sent. 2140 len. 30]: After the hurried return to the house , the three guests had sat alone , waiting in miserable suspense for the doctor 's verdict , but Pixie had disappeared .
Parsing [sent. 2141 len. 8]: No one knew where she had gone .
Parsing [sent. 2142 len. 22]: Honor searched for her in vain , and at last in an access of anxiety Stanor himself took up the quest .
Parsing [sent. 2143 len. 28]: He found her at last , perched on the wide window-seat of an upper window , but all his persuasions could not move her from her post .
Parsing [sent. 2144 len. 7]: `` Let me stay here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2145 len. 3]: she persisted .
Parsing [sent. 2146 len. 5]: `` It comforts me .
Parsing [sent. 2147 len. 13]: I can see -- I can see the _ lights _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2148 len. 14]: `` You mean the motor lamps as they come up the drive ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2149 len. 15]: `` No , '' she said simply , `` I mean the stars . ''
Parsing [sent. 2150 len. 26]: Stanor was as unimaginative as most men of his age , and his first impression was that the poor little thing was off her head .
Parsing [sent. 2151 len. 26]: He crept downstairs and rang for a basin of the good warm soup with which he and his companions had been provided an hour before .
Parsing [sent. 2152 len. 25]: When it was brought he carried the tray carefully up three long flights of stairs , and besought of Pixie to drink it forthwith .
Parsing [sent. 2153 len. 34]: She shook her head , and all his persuasions could not rouse her to the exertion ; but being an obstinate young man , he but set his lips and determined to succeed .
Parsing [sent. 2154 len. 42]: This time , however , he resorted to force instead of persuasion , for , having placed the tray on a corner of the sill , he filled the spoon with soup and held it determinedly to the girl 's lips .
Parsing [sent. 2155 len. 29]: Now , if she moved or made a fuss , the soup would assuredly be spilled , and no living girl would voluntarily pour soup over her frock !
Parsing [sent. 2156 len. 6]: But Pixie made no fuss .
Parsing [sent. 2157 len. 31]: Meekly , obediently as a little bird , she opened her lips , and swallowed , and swallowed again and again , until the bowl was emptied of its contents .
Parsing [sent. 2158 len. 35]: There was something so trustful and unconscious about the action that the young man felt the smart of tears in his eyes -- the first tears he had known for many a long year .
Parsing [sent. 2159 len. 26]: When the soup had been finished he went away again , and came back with a warm shawl which he had procured from a maid .
Parsing [sent. 2160 len. 37]: In wrapping it round the quiescent figure his hands had accidentally come in contact with hers , and finding them cold as ice , it seemed the natural thing to chafe them gently between his own .
Parsing [sent. 2161 len. 22]: Quite natural also Pixie appeared to find the action , for the cold little fingers had tightened affectionately round his own .
Parsing [sent. 2162 len. 16]: It was left to him to flush and feel embarrassed ; Pixie remained placidly unmoved .
Parsing [sent. 2163 len. 21]: The memory of those moments was vivid with Stanor as he stood this morning looking down on the sleeping girl .
Parsing [sent. 2164 len. 23]: All through the three days of separation her image had pursued him , and he had longed increasingly to see her again .
Parsing [sent. 2165 len. 25]: The tragic incidents of that long night had had more effect in strengthening his dawning love than many weeks of placid , uneventful lives .
Parsing [sent. 2166 len. 41]: It had brought them heart to heart , soul to soul ; all the little veneers and conventions of society had been thrust aside , and it seemed to him that the crisis had revealed her altogether sweet and true .
Parsing [sent. 2167 len. 44]: When a young man is brought suddenly face to face with death , when it is demonstrated before his eyes that the life of the youngest among us hangs upon a thread , he is in the mood to appreciate the higher qualities .
Parsing [sent. 2168 len. 26]: Stanor had told himself uneasily that he had been `` too slack , '' that he had not thought enough about `` these things . ''
Parsing [sent. 2169 len. 25]: The friends with whom he had consorted were mostly careless pleasure-lovers like himself , but this little girl was made of a finer clay .
Parsing [sent. 2170 len. 18]: To live with her would be an inspiration : she would `` pull a fellow together . ''
Parsing [sent. 2171 len. 32]: ... There was , however , to be quite honest , another and less worthy impetus which urged Stanor forward , but over this he preferred to draw a mental veil .
Parsing [sent. 2172 len. 56]: We are all guilty of the absurdity of posing for our own benefit , and Stanor , like the rest , preferred to believe himself actuated wholly by lofty motives rather than partially by the wounded pride of a young man who has just discovered that he has been `` managed '' by an elder !
Parsing [sent. 2173 len. 17]: He sat down on the seat beside Pixie , and laid his hand gently over hers .
Parsing [sent. 2174 len. 28]: They opened automatically to receive it ; even before she lifted her lids he felt the welcoming touch ; and felt it characteristic of her nature . ''
Parsing [sent. 2175 len. 5]: _ You _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2176 len. 12]: she cried gladly , `` Mr Vaughan , 't is you !
Parsing [sent. 2177 len. 6]: Oh , that 's nice !
Parsing [sent. 2178 len. 12]: Was I sleeping , that I did n't see you come ?
Parsing [sent. 2179 len. 8]: I thought I should never sleep again .
Parsing [sent. 2180 len. 5]: Jack ca n't sleep !
Parsing [sent. 2181 len. 9]: If he slept he might get well . ''
Parsing [sent. 2182 len. 11]: `` He is sleeping now , '' said Stanor quietly .
Parsing [sent. 2183 len. 26]: `` A man was sent to the lodge to answer all inquiries , so that there should not be even a crunch on the path .
Parsing [sent. 2184 len. 7]: He is sleeping soundly and well .
Parsing [sent. 2185 len. 13]: If he sleeps on -- '' Pixie nodded , her face aglow .
Parsing [sent. 2186 len. 6]: `` Oh , thank God !
Parsing [sent. 2187 len. 7]: _ How _ I thank Him !
Parsing [sent. 2188 len. 7]: Sleep will make all the difference .
Parsing [sent. 2189 len. 20]: ... Till now it 's been nothing but a moment 's nap and awake again , with a scream .
Parsing [sent. 2190 len. 8]: We 've _ agonised _ for sleep !
Parsing [sent. 2191 len. 24]: I could not have gone off so soundly if I had n't known , _ inside _ , that Jack was asleep too .
Parsing [sent. 2192 len. 15]: When you love anyone very , very much , what touches them touches you .
Parsing [sent. 2193 len. 6]: You ca n't keep apart .
Parsing [sent. 2194 len. 30]: You may n't always know it with your _ mind _ , but the best part of you , the part that feels , _ it _ knows ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2195 len. 20]: She smiled in his face with frank , glad eyes , but Stanor flushed and looked at the ground .
Parsing [sent. 2196 len. 15]: `` Should you know it , if _ I _ were unhappy , Pixie ?
Parsing [sent. 2197 len. 7]: I should know it about you .
Parsing [sent. 2198 len. 29]: I came this afternoon partly , mostly , because I knew how you 'd be feeling , and I thought , I hoped , that I might help .
Parsing [sent. 2199 len. 19]: Does it help you , Pixie , to have me sitting beside you , instead of being alone ?
Parsing [sent. 2200 len. 11]: Ought I to have come , or stayed away ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2201 len. 13]: `` I 'm glad you came ; I love to have you .
Parsing [sent. 2202 len. 16]: I 've been sad before this , but I 've never been sad by myself !
Parsing [sent. 2203 len. 34]: Esmeralda is n't my sister at this moment , she 's just Jack 's mother , and there 's only one person who can help her , and that is Jack 's father .
Parsing [sent. 2204 len. 7]: Later on ` twill change ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2205 len. 10]: A flash of joy lit up the white face .
Parsing [sent. 2206 len. 10]: `` Do you know what I 'm waiting for ?
Parsing [sent. 2207 len. 20]: If Jack lives , as soon as he 's conscious and out of pain he 'll send for me !
Parsing [sent. 2208 len. 21]: He 'll want me to tell him stories , and the stronger he grows the more stories he 'll want !
Parsing [sent. 2209 len. 13]: He 'll need me then -- they 'll all need me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2210 len. 8]: `` Of course they 'll need you .
Parsing [sent. 2211 len. 11]: Other people need you , Pixie , besides your relations .
Parsing [sent. 2212 len. 9]: Why do you always go back to them ?
Parsing [sent. 2213 len. 6]: I was speaking of myself .
Parsing [sent. 2214 len. 6]: _ I _ need you !
Parsing [sent. 2215 len. 12]: I 've felt all at sea without you these last days .
Parsing [sent. 2216 len. 9]: I never met a girl like you before .
Parsing [sent. 2217 len. 31]: Most girls are all one way or another -- so serious that they 're dull , or so empty-headed that it 's a waste of time to talk to them .
Parsing [sent. 2218 len. 29]: You -- you are such a festive little thing , Pixie ; a fellow could never be dull in your company , and yet you 're so good !
Parsing [sent. 2219 len. 16]: You have such sweet thoughts ; you are so unselfish , so kind . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 2220 len. 6]: _ Go _ on ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2221 len. 5]: cried Pixie urgently . ''
Parsing [sent. 2222 len. 6]: _ Go _ on ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2223 len. 11]: Her cheeks had flushed , her eyes sparkled with animation .
Parsing [sent. 2224 len. 23]: `` It 's the most reviving thing in the world to hear oneself praised , I could listen to it for hours .
Parsing [sent. 2225 len. 20]: In what particular way , now , would you say that I was ` _ sweet _ ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 2226 len. 26]: She peered at him , complacent , curious , blightingly unconscious of his emotions , and the young man felt a stirring of hot impatience .
Parsing [sent. 2227 len. 47]: Insinuation and innuendo were of no use where Pixie O'Shaughnessy was concerned ; an ordinary girl might scent a proposal afar off and amuse herself by an affectation of innocence , but nothing short of a plain declaration of love would convince Pixie of his sincerity .
Parsing [sent. 2228 len. 14]: `` Pixie , '' he said suddenly , `` look at me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2229 len. 20]: He took her hands in his , and drew her round so as to face him as they sat .
Parsing [sent. 2230 len. 11]: `` Look at me , Pixie , '' he repeated .
Parsing [sent. 2231 len. 6]: `` Look in my eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2232 len. 9]: Tell me , what do you see ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2233 len. 10]: Pixie looked , her own eyes wide and amazed .
Parsing [sent. 2234 len. 29]: Her fingers stirred within his hands with a single nervous twitch , and then lay still , while into her eyes crept an expression of wonder and awe .
Parsing [sent. 2235 len. 6]: `` I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 2236 len. 6]: -- I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 2237 len. 7]: ... What do I see ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2238 len. 5]: `` Love , Pixie !
Parsing [sent. 2239 len. 3]: My love .
Parsing [sent. 2240 len. 5]: My love for you .
Parsing [sent. 2241 len. 16]: ... I 've fallen in love with you , darling ; did n't you know ?
Parsing [sent. 2242 len. 12]: I knew it that last evening when we were together upstairs .
Parsing [sent. 2243 len. 26]: I 've known it better and better each day since ; and to-day I could n't stay away , I could n't wait any longer .
Parsing [sent. 2244 len. 10]: ... Pixie , do you love me too ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2245 len. 7]: `` Of course I love you .
Parsing [sent. 2246 len. 7]: How could I help it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2247 len. 4]: cried Pixie warmly .
Parsing [sent. 2248 len. 16]: Her fingers tightened round his with affectionate pressure , her eyes beamed encouragingly upon him .
Parsing [sent. 2249 len. 61]: Never could there have been a warmer , a more spontaneous response , and yet , strange to relate , its very ardour had a chilling effect , for Stanor , though young , was experienced enough to realise that it is not in this fashion that a girl receives a declaration of love from the man of her heart .
Parsing [sent. 2250 len. 55]: He himself had struggled with shyness and agitation ; he was conscious of flushed cheeks , of a hoarseness of voice , of the beating of pulses ; then surely a girl taken by surprise , faced suddenly , with the question of such enormous import , should not be less moved than he .
Parsing [sent. 2251 len. 14]: The words died upon his lips ; involuntarily his hands relaxed their grasp .
Parsing [sent. 2252 len. 25]: There was a moment of impossible impasse and strain before , with a realised effort , he forced himself to express a due delight .
Parsing [sent. 2253 len. 9]: `` That makes me very happy , Pixie .
Parsing [sent. 2254 len. 10]: I -- I was afraid you might not care .
Parsing [sent. 2255 len. 20]: I 'm not half good enough for you , I know that , but I 'll do my best .
Parsing [sent. 2256 len. 11]: I 'll do everything I can to make you happy .
Parsing [sent. 2257 len. 31]: I 'm not rich , you know , darling ; we should have to live on what I can make independently of the uncle , for he has peculiar views .
Parsing [sent. 2258 len. 10]: He does n't wish me to marry . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 2259 len. 5]: _ Marry _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2260 len. 4]: repeated Pixie deeply .
Parsing [sent. 2261 len. 17]: She sat bolt upright in her seat , her eyes suddenly alight with interest and excitement .
Parsing [sent. 2262 len. 24]: Incredible as it might appear , Stanor realised that this was the first moment when the idea of marriage had entered her brain .
Parsing [sent. 2263 len. 11]: `` Is it _ marrying _ you are talking about ?
Parsing [sent. 2264 len. 10]: You want _ me _ to marry you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2265 len. 6]: `` You funny little soul .
Parsing [sent. 2266 len. 6]: Of course I want it .
Parsing [sent. 2267 len. 9]: Why else should I talk about loving ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2268 len. 16]: `` I thought , '' she said sighing , `` it was just nice feeling !
Parsing [sent. 2269 len. 10]: It 's natural for people to love each other .
Parsing [sent. 2270 len. 13]: When they live together in the same house and come through trouble .
Parsing [sent. 2271 len. 7]: ... And we 're both attractive .
Parsing [sent. 2272 len. 13]: ... You do n't need to marry every one you love ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2273 len. 22]: `` I do , '' declared Stanor , `` when it 's a girl -- when it 's _ you _ !
Parsing [sent. 2274 len. 28]: I want to have you for my own , and keep you to myself , and how can I do that if you 're not my wife ?
Parsing [sent. 2275 len. 14]: If you love me , you must want to be with me too .
Parsing [sent. 2276 len. 12]: Do n't you , dear , do n't you wish it ?
Parsing [sent. 2277 len. 10]: Should n't you like to be my wife ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2278 len. 11]: Pixie tilted her head in her well-known attitude of consideration .
Parsing [sent. 2279 len. 9]: `` I -- I think I should ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2280 len. 4]: she pronounced judicially .
Parsing [sent. 2281 len. 17]: `` I liked you from the moment we met , and you 've a good disposition .
Parsing [sent. 2282 len. 6]: Dispositions are important in marriage .
Parsing [sent. 2283 len. 19]: And I 'm domestic ; you like domestic girls , and it 's convenient when you 're poor .
Parsing [sent. 2284 len. 15]: ... On how much a head would you expect me to keep house ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2285 len. 25]: But that was too much for Stanor 's endurance ; he seized her in his strong arms and shook her with a tender violence .
Parsing [sent. 2286 len. 14]: `` Pixie , you little witch , do n't be so blightingly matter-of-fact !
Parsing [sent. 2287 len. 9]: I 'm making you a declaration of love .
Parsing [sent. 2288 len. 8]: Kindly receive it in a suitable fashion .
Parsing [sent. 2289 len. 46]: ... A -- a fellow expects a girl to be a little -- er -- sentimental and poetic , and -- er -- overcome , do n't you know , not to begin at once to talk of _ how much a head _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2290 len. 9]: `` I 've never been proposed to before .
Parsing [sent. 2291 len. 9]: You must excuse me if I make mistakes .
Parsing [sent. 2292 len. 20]: I 'm quite willing to be sentimental ; I dote upon sentiment , '' declared Pixie in anxious propitiation .
Parsing [sent. 2293 len. 14]: ... `` Let 's go back to where you were talking about me !
Parsing [sent. 2294 len. 14]: Tell me _ exactly _ what it is that you most admire ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2295 len. 31]: Stanor had been hoping for a little adulation for himself , but he gallantly stifled his feelings and proceeded to offer the incense which he believed would be most acceptable .
Parsing [sent. 2296 len. 6]: `` Your character , darling .
Parsing [sent. 2297 len. 7]: Your sweet and tender heart ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2298 len. 9]: `` How nice , '' said Pixie flatly .
Parsing [sent. 2299 len. 21]: She sat silent for a moment and then ventured tentatively , '' _ Not _ my personal charm ? '' ''
Parsing [sent. 2300 len. 7]: _ And _ your personal charm .
Parsing [sent. 2301 len. 2]: Both !
Parsing [sent. 2302 len. 12]: You 've more personal charm than any girl I know . ''
Parsing [sent. 2303 len. 5]: This was something like !
Parsing [sent. 2304 len. 4]: Pixie beamed content .
Parsing [sent. 2305 len. 27]: At this moment she felt really `` engaged , '' and agreed rapturously with all the encomiums which she had heard given to this happy condition .
Parsing [sent. 2306 len. 7]: Success emboldened her to further flights .
Parsing [sent. 2307 len. 14]: `` The first time you met me you did n't admire me then !
Parsing [sent. 2308 len. 8]: My _ appearance _ , I mean !
Parsing [sent. 2309 len. 10]: You remember you said -- '' `` I did .
Parsing [sent. 2310 len. 2]: Yes !
Parsing [sent. 2311 len. 19]: But you were so sweet in forgiving me that I admired you instantly for _ that _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2312 len. 11]: cried Stanor , skilfully turning the subject to safer ground .
Parsing [sent. 2313 len. 24]: `` And when you 're my wife , Pixie , you will seem the most beautiful woman in the world in my eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2314 len. 27]: It is very unworldly of you to consent without asking more about my affairs , for I am a poor match for you , little one .
Parsing [sent. 2315 len. 21]: It takes years for a man to make a decent income in business , and I have so little experience .
Parsing [sent. 2316 len. 27]: My uncle has always promised to buy me a partnership in some good firm , but of course there would have to be some preliminary training .
Parsing [sent. 2317 len. 22]: And if he did not ... approve ... '' `` But he _ must _ approve ; we must make him .
Parsing [sent. 2318 len. 8]: We could n't marry without his consent .
Parsing [sent. 2319 len. 9]: He 's been so good to you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2320 len. 22]: `` He has , uncommonly good ; but when it comes to marrying , it 's a fellow 's own affair .
Parsing [sent. 2321 len. 14]: I shall go my own way ... '' `` He 's lame ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2322 len. 17]: `` Dear little girl , what has that to do with the case in point ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2323 len. 9]: `` Well , I think it has ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2324 len. 4]: persisted Pixie obstinately .
Parsing [sent. 2325 len. 6]: `` It has to me .
Parsing [sent. 2326 len. 24]: We must be nice to him , Stanor , and _ make _ him be pleased , whether he wants to or not .
Parsing [sent. 2327 len. 14]: ... Did you notice how naturally I called you ` Stanor ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2328 len. 4]: `` I did !
Parsing [sent. 2329 len. 16]: Could n't you manage to put something before it by way , of completion ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2330 len. 4]: `` Nice Stanor !
Parsing [sent. 2331 len. 3]: Handsome Stanor !
Parsing [sent. 2332 len. 8]: Clever , sensible , discriminating Stanor ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2333 len. 28]: `` Quite so , '' said the discriminating one dryly , `` but I should have liked -- '' Suddenly he burst into a ringing boyish laugh .
Parsing [sent. 2334 len. 14]: `` This is the _ rummiest _ proposal that was ever made ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2335 len. 4]: Pixie looked anxious .
Parsing [sent. 2336 len. 4]: `` Is it ?
Parsing [sent. 2337 len. 4]: ` Rum ' ?
Parsing [sent. 2338 len. 13]: What exactly does ` rum ' mean , applied to a proposal ?
Parsing [sent. 2339 len. 6]: It did n't sound approving .
Parsing [sent. 2340 len. 15]: It 's my very own proposal , and I wo n't have it abused .
Parsing [sent. 2341 len. 7]: I 've enjoyed it very much .
Parsing [sent. 2342 len. 25]: ... I think we shall be very happy , Stanor , when we are married and settled down in our own little house . ''
Parsing [sent. 2343 len. 13]: Stanor looked at her keenly , and as he looked he sighed .
Parsing [sent. 2344 len. 17]: `` Dear little Pixie , '' he said gently , `` I hope we shall ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2345 len. 3]: CHAPTER FIFTEEN .
Parsing [sent. 2346 len. 4]: ESMERALDA IS TROUBLED .
Parsing [sent. 2347 len. 4]: `` Engaged ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2348 len. 4]: cried Esmeralda shrilly .
Parsing [sent. 2349 len. 3]: `` Engaged !
Parsing [sent. 2350 len. 2]: You !
Parsing [sent. 2351 len. 4]: To Stanor Vaughan ?
Parsing [sent. 2352 len. 13]: Pixie O'Shaughnessy , I never heard such nonsense in my life . ''
Parsing [sent. 2353 len. 12]: `` Then you 've listened to an uncommon amount of sense .
Parsing [sent. 2354 len. 36]: I should not have thought it , to judge from your actions , '' returned Pixie , nettled , '' ` Twould be interesting to hear what strikes you as so ridiculous about it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2355 len. 40]: It was three days after Stanor 's unexpected visit with its momentous consequences , but in consideration of the anxiety of Jack 's parents , the news had been withheld until the boy had been pronounced out of danger .
Parsing [sent. 2356 len. 10]: Only this morning had the glad verdict been vouchsafed .
Parsing [sent. 2357 len. 33]: Jack would live ; given a steady , even improvement , with no unforeseen complications , he would live , and in a few weeks time be up and about once more .
Parsing [sent. 2358 len. 30]: The eye trouble would be more lasting , for the child was of a peculiarly sensitive nature , and the shock seemed inclined to localise itself in the eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2359 len. 21]: The sight itself would be saved , but for some years to come it would need the most careful tending .
Parsing [sent. 2360 len. 17]: He must wear darkened spectacles ; be forbidden to read ; be constantly under skilled care .
Parsing [sent. 2361 len. 37]: Given such precautions the sight would probably become normal in later years ... When the first verdict was given , the father , and mother clung to one another in an ecstasy of relief and thankfulness .
Parsing [sent. 2362 len. 37]: Throughout those last terrible days , when every conscious breath had carried with it a prayer , Joan had looked deep into her own soul and beheld with opened eyes the precipice on which she stood .
Parsing [sent. 2363 len. 62]: How far , how far she had travelled since those early married days , when , with her first-born in her arms , her highest ambition had been that she should be enabled so to train him that he should grow up , to be , in the words of the beautiful old phrase , `` A soldier of Christ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2364 len. 23]: Of late years she had had many ambitions for her boys , but they had been ambitions of the world , worldly .
Parsing [sent. 2365 len. 17]: The old faith had been gradually neglected and allowed to sink into the background of life .
Parsing [sent. 2366 len. 16]: In her own strength she had walked , in her own weakness she had failed .
Parsing [sent. 2367 len. 19]: Yet now , in default of punishment , goodness and mercy were once more to be her portion !
Parsing [sent. 2368 len. 22]: All the nobility in Joan 's nature rose up as she pledged herself afresh to a new -- a higher life !
Parsing [sent. 2369 len. 23]: Jack would live , their boy would live -- that was for days the one thought of which the parents were conscious .
Parsing [sent. 2370 len. 18]: For the father it was perfect joy , but for the mother there still remained a pang .
Parsing [sent. 2371 len. 21]: Only Esmeralda herself ever knew the anguish of grief which she endured on account of her baby 's altered looks .
Parsing [sent. 2372 len. 26]: Little Jack , with his angel face , his halo of curls , his exquisite , innocent eyes , had been a joy to behold .
Parsing [sent. 2373 len. 36]: Waking , sleeping , merry , sad -- at one and every moment , of his life the mere sight of him had been as an open sesame to the hearts of those who beheld .
Parsing [sent. 2374 len. 21]: The knife turned in his mother 's heart at the thought of _ Jack _ shorn , scarred , spectacled .
Parsing [sent. 2375 len. 10]: She dared not confide her grief to her husband .
Parsing [sent. 2376 len. 5]: He would not understand .
Parsing [sent. 2377 len. 4]: _ Looks _ !
Parsing [sent. 2378 len. 14]: What could looks matter , when the child had been delivered from death ?
Parsing [sent. 2379 len. 38]: Joan could see in imagination the expression on his face , hear the shocked tones of his voice ; she would not betray her feelings and risk a break of the new , sweet understanding between them .
Parsing [sent. 2380 len. 5]: All men were alike .
Parsing [sent. 2381 len. 10]: There were occasions when only another woman could understand .
Parsing [sent. 2382 len. 16]: Joan went upstairs to the empty nursery and found Marie weeping in her chair . ''
Parsing [sent. 2383 len. 4]: _ Petite lapin !
Parsing [sent. 2384 len. 3]: Petite cherie !
Parsing [sent. 2385 len. 4]: Petite ange _ !
Parsing [sent. 2386 len. 26]: Comfort thyself , Madame , '' she sobbed , `` we can have glasses like the young American -- she who visited Madame last year .
Parsing [sent. 2387 len. 7]: No rims hardly to be observed !
Parsing [sent. 2388 len. 15]: And the hair -- that will grow -- of a surety it will grow .
Parsing [sent. 2389 len. 12]: A little long upon the forehead , and _ voila _ !
Parsing [sent. 2390 len. 5]: The scar is hid .
Parsing [sent. 2391 len. 24]: ... A little care , Madame , a little patience , and he will be once more our _ petit amour _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2392 len. 16]: `` Marie , '' said her mistress firmly , `` looks are a secondary affair .
Parsing [sent. 2393 len. 15]: We ought to be too thankful to _ think _ of looks ! '' ''
Parsing [sent. 2394 len. 47]: _ C'est vrai _ , Madame , '' replied Marie demurely , '' _ C'est vrai _ , '' and Joan Hilliard went back to her room with a lightened heart , and determined to write at once to town to ask particulars concerning rimless spectacles .
Parsing [sent. 2395 len. 13]: And now here was Pixie , with this preposterous , ridiculous tale !
Parsing [sent. 2396 len. 14]: At sight of her young sister Joan had felt a pang of contrition .
Parsing [sent. 2397 len. 11]: She had forgotten all about her these last terrible days .
Parsing [sent. 2398 len. 3]: Poor girl !
Parsing [sent. 2399 len. 24]: She must have been terribly lonely , but that was the best of Pixie -- she was always ready to forgive and forget .
Parsing [sent. 2400 len. 19]: Joan kissed her warmly , murmured apologies , and inquired affectionately how the long days had been passed .
Parsing [sent. 2401 len. 7]: And then -- out it came !
Parsing [sent. 2402 len. 5]: `` Why ridiculous ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2403 len. 3]: echoed Joan .
Parsing [sent. 2404 len. 11]: `` My dear , how could it be anything else ?
Parsing [sent. 2405 len. 20]: Five days ago , when we were all together , there was n't a sign of such a thing .
Parsing [sent. 2406 len. 16]: Stanor was attracted by you , of course ; but he was not in love .
Parsing [sent. 2407 len. 8]: He was always cheerful , always merry .
Parsing [sent. 2408 len. 17]: How different from poor Robert , who is eating his heart out for Honor Ward ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2409 len. 19]: `` I hope , '' said Pixie deeply , `` that Stanor will always _ keep _ cheerful .
Parsing [sent. 2410 len. 11]: It wo n't be my fault if he does not .
Parsing [sent. 2411 len. 18]: No man shall ` eat his heart out ' for me if I can help it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2412 len. 6]: Joan glanced at her quickly .
Parsing [sent. 2413 len. 20]: She had caught the tone of pain in the beautiful voice , and softened to it with instant response .
Parsing [sent. 2414 len. 8]: `` Yes , dear , of course .
Parsing [sent. 2415 len. 24]: You 'd never flirt , you 're too honest , but , all the same , Pixie , I stick to my opinion .
Parsing [sent. 2416 len. 33]: I do n't believe for a moment that Stanor Vaughan is in love with you , and I 'm positively sure that _ you _ are not in love with him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2417 len. 17]: `` Can you look into my heart , Esmeralda , and see what is there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2418 len. 6]: `` Yes , I can .
Parsing [sent. 2419 len. 6]: In this instance I can .
Parsing [sent. 2420 len. 8]: Fifty times better than you can yourself .
Parsing [sent. 2421 len. 12]: You are pleased , you are flattered , you are interested .
Parsing [sent. 2422 len. 17]: You were miserable and lonely , -LRB- that 's my fault , for leaving you alone .
Parsing [sent. 2423 len. 12]: I do n't know what Bridgie will say to me ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 2424 len. 34]: and Stanor was sorry for you , you appealed to his chivalry , and you were just in the mood to be swept off your feet , without realising what it all meant .
Parsing [sent. 2425 len. 20]: Pixie , when you told me just now , you were quite calm , you never even blushed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2426 len. 20]: `` I do n't think , '' reflected Pixie thoughtfully , `` I ever blushed in my life . ''
Parsing [sent. 2427 len. 20]: It occurred to her uncomfortably that Stanor also had noticed the omission , and had felt himself defrauded thereby .
Parsing [sent. 2428 len. 12]: She wondered uneasily if one could _ learn _ to blush !
Parsing [sent. 2429 len. 33]: As for Esmeralda , the words carried her back in a rush to the dear days of childhood , when the little sister had been the pet and pride of the family .
Parsing [sent. 2430 len. 11]: Indeed , and Pixie had had no need to blush !
Parsing [sent. 2431 len. 36]: Her very failings had been twisted round to pose as so many assets in her favour , while her own happy self-confidence had instilled the belief that every one wanted her , every one appreciated .
Parsing [sent. 2432 len. 8]: What cause had Pixie O'Shaughnessy to blush ?
Parsing [sent. 2433 len. 4]: `` Mavourneen ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2434 len. 8]: cried Esmeralda tenderly , `` I know .
Parsing [sent. 2435 len. 28]: Thank God you 've never needed to blush or feel afraid , but , Pixie , when love comes , it 's different , everything is different !
Parsing [sent. 2436 len. 6]: It 's a new birth .
Parsing [sent. 2437 len. 23]: The old confidence goes , for it 's a new life that lies ahead , and one stands trembling on the brink .
Parsing [sent. 2438 len. 14]: ... If what you feel is the right thing , you 'll understand .
Parsing [sent. 2439 len. 15]: Pixie , dear , do I seem the wrong person to talk like this ?
Parsing [sent. 2440 len. 9]: You know how it has been with us .
Parsing [sent. 2441 len. 33]: We drifted apart -- Geoff and I -- so far apart that I thought ... I ca n't talk of it -- you know what I thought -- but , Pixie think !
Parsing [sent. 2442 len. 29]: If the feeling between us had not been the _ real _ thing , if we had married on affection only , where should we have been now ?
Parsing [sent. 2443 len. 50]: Geoffrey loved me so much that he bore with me , through all these years of strain , and when this great trouble came , he forgave me at once , forgave everything , blotted it right out , and thought of nothing but how to help me most .
Parsing [sent. 2444 len. 37]: A cloud had rolled up between us , but it was _ only _ a cloud , the love was there all the time , hidden , like the sun , ready to shine out again .
Parsing [sent. 2445 len. 32]: ... Oh , Pixie , dear , the right thing is so wonderful , so grand , that I ca n't let you miss it for the sake of a mistake .
Parsing [sent. 2446 len. 5]: You are so young .
Parsing [sent. 2447 len. 5]: You do n't understand .
Parsing [sent. 2448 len. 24]: Let me write to Stanor to-night and tell him it 's a mistake , that you did n't know your own mind ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2449 len. 23]: `` You may talk till doomsday , Esmeralda , '' said Pixie quietly , `` but I shall keep my word ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2450 len. 34]: Mentally Pixie had been deeply impressed by the other 's confidences , and not a little perturbed thereby , but it was against her sense of loyalty to allow such feelings to appear .
Parsing [sent. 2451 len. 30]: To her own heart she confessed that she was altogether without this strange sense of elation , this mysterious new birth which Esmeralda considered all important under the circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 2452 len. 23]: She was certainly happy , for with Stanor 's coming the cloud which had hovered over the house had begun to disperse .
Parsing [sent. 2453 len. 54]: She had opened her own eyes to the good news of Jack 's first sleep , and each day the improvement had continued , while Stanor motored over , to sit by her side , cheering her , saying loving , gentle things , building castles in the air of a life together .
Parsing [sent. 2454 len. 31]: ... Yes , she was _ very _ happy , but ... she had been happy before , there was nothing astoundingly , incredibly _ new _ in her sensations .
Parsing [sent. 2455 len. 26]: Pixie sent her thoughts back into the past , endeavouring to recall recollections of Joan 's engagement , of Bridgie 's , of Jack 's .
Parsing [sent. 2456 len. 14]: Yes , certainly they had all become exceedingly different under the new conditions .
Parsing [sent. 2457 len. 12]: She recalled in especial Bridgie 's face beneath her bridal veil .
Parsing [sent. 2458 len. 42]: Child as she herself had been at that time she had been arrested by that expression : nor had she been allowed to forget it , for from time to time during the last six years she had seen it again .
Parsing [sent. 2459 len. 8]: `` The _ shiny _ look ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2460 len. 8]: she had christened it in her thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 2461 len. 24]: Sweet and loving were Bridgie 's eyes for every soul that breathed , but that one particular look shone for one person alone !
Parsing [sent. 2462 len. 57]: Pixie 's heart contracted in a pang of longing ; it was almost like the pang she had felt in the drawing-room of Holly House on that dread afternoon when the news of her father 's death had been broken to her -- a pang of longing , a sore , sore feeling of something wanting .
Parsing [sent. 2463 len. 11]: She shivered , then drew herself together with indignant remembrance .
Parsing [sent. 2464 len. 6]: She was _ engaged _ !
Parsing [sent. 2465 len. 9]: What sentiments were these for an engaged girl ?
Parsing [sent. 2466 len. 16]: How could she feel a blank when still more love was added to her share ?
Parsing [sent. 2467 len. 15]: `` If you talk till doomsday , Esmeralda , I 'll keep my word .
Parsing [sent. 2468 len. 10]: Stanor loves me and says I can help him .
Parsing [sent. 2469 len. 15]: I said I would , and , me dear , _ I will _ !
Parsing [sent. 2470 len. 26]: We 've been through a lot of trouble this last week , is n't it a pity to try to make more for no good ?
Parsing [sent. 2471 len. 7]: My mind 's made up ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2472 len. 5]: Joan Hilliard was silent .
Parsing [sent. 2473 len. 15]: In her heart of hearts she realised that there was nothing more to say .
Parsing [sent. 2474 len. 4]: Pixie was Pixie .
Parsing [sent. 2475 len. 30]: As well try to move a mountain from its place , as persuade that sweet , loving , most loyal of creatures to draw back from a solemn pledge .
Parsing [sent. 2476 len. 21]: Something might be done with Stanor perhaps , or , failing Stanor , through that erratic person , his uncle .
Parsing [sent. 2477 len. 26]: She must consult with Geoffrey and Bridgie , together they might insist upon a period of waiting and separation before a definite engagement was announced .
Parsing [sent. 2478 len. 6]: Pixie was still under age .
Parsing [sent. 2479 len. 12]: Until her twenty-first birthday her guardians might safely demand a delay .
Parsing [sent. 2480 len. 25]: Joan knew that Stanor Vaughan had had passing fancies before now , and had little belief that the present entanglement would prove more lasting .
Parsing [sent. 2481 len. 18]: Circumstances had induced a special intimacy with Pixie , but when they were separated he would repent .
Parsing [sent. 2482 len. 8]: -- If he himself set Pixie free !
Parsing [sent. 2483 len. 28]: ... So far did Joan 's thoughts carry her , then , looking at the girl 's happy face , she felt a sharp pang of contrition .
Parsing [sent. 2484 len. 11]: `` Me dear , I want you to be happy !
Parsing [sent. 2485 len. 25]: If it makes you happy to marry Stanor , I 'll give you my blessing , and the finest trousseau that money can buy .
Parsing [sent. 2486 len. 13]: You 're young yet , and he has his way to make .
Parsing [sent. 2487 len. 29]: You 'll have to wait patiently , for a few years , until he can make a home , but it 's a happy time , being engaged .
Parsing [sent. 2488 len. 12]: I feel defrauded myself to have had so little of it .
Parsing [sent. 2489 len. 55]: Storing up things in a bottom drawer , and picking up old furniture at sales , and polishing it up so lovingly , thinking of where it is going , and letters coming and going , and looking forward to the time when he 'll come down next -- 't is a beautiful time .
Parsing [sent. 2490 len. 12]: Three or four years ought to pass like a trice ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2491 len. 11]: `` Besides leaving plenty of time to change your mind .
Parsing [sent. 2492 len. 8]: I know you , me dear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2493 len. 4]: cried Pixie shrewdly .
Parsing [sent. 2494 len. 6]: `` I see through you !
Parsing [sent. 2495 len. 27]: You 'll be relieved to hear that the date has not been mentioned , but you can start with the trousseau as soon as you please .
Parsing [sent. 2496 len. 27]: I 'll take it in quarterly instalments , and spin out the pleasure , besides sparing my friends the shock of seeing me suddenly turn grand .
Parsing [sent. 2497 len. 14]: My affianced suitor is coming to proffer a formal demand for my hand .
Parsing [sent. 2498 len. 15]: Will ye be kind to him now , and give him some tea ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2499 len. 9]: `` I will , '' said Joan readily .
Parsing [sent. 2500 len. 28]: To herself she added : `` We are all alike , we O'Shaughnessys , we will be led , but we will _ not _ be driven .
Parsing [sent. 2501 len. 8]: It 's no use appearing to object !
Parsing [sent. 2502 len. 11]: Things must just take their course ... '' CHAPTER SIXTEEN .
Parsing [sent. 2503 len. 6]: THE `` RUNKLE '' INTERVENES .
Parsing [sent. 2504 len. 27]: As little Jack continued to progress towards convalescence , the attention of the household became increasingly absorbed by the astounding fact of Pixie 's projected engagement .
Parsing [sent. 2505 len. 36]: Bridgie , detained at home by malapropos ailments on the part of the children , wrote urgent letters by daily posts , contradicting herself on every point saving one alone -- the advisability of delay .
Parsing [sent. 2506 len. 32]: Geoffrey Hilliard as host , Dick Victor as guardian , Jack , Pat , and Miles as brothers , proposed , seconded , and carried by acclamation the same waiting policy .
Parsing [sent. 2507 len. 33]: And no one who has the faintest knowledge of human nature will need to be told that such an attitude had the effect of rousing the youthful lovers to the liveliest impatience .
Parsing [sent. 2508 len. 8]: Stanor in particular was moved to rebellion .
Parsing [sent. 2509 len. 23]: His pride was hurt by so lukewarm a reception of his addresses , which was all the more disagreeable for being unexpected .
Parsing [sent. 2510 len. 31]: The Hilliards had shown so much friendship and hospitality to him as a friend , that he had taken for granted that they would welcome him in a closer relationship .
Parsing [sent. 2511 len. 34]: He was not a great _ parti _ it was true , but then by her own confession Pixie had no fortune of her own , and had been accustomed to modest means .
Parsing [sent. 2512 len. 46]: Stanor did not say to himself in so many words that he happened to possess an exceptionally handsome and popular personality , he refused even to frame a definite thought to that effect ; nevertheless the consciousness was there , and added to his chagrin .
Parsing [sent. 2513 len. 79]: Lounging along the country lanes , his hands thrust deep into his pockets , Stanor told himself that it was a disappointing old world : a fellow always imagined that when he got engaged he would have the time of his life ; in books a fellow was represented as walking upon air , in a condition of rapture too intense for belief -- it was disappointing to find his own experience fall so short of the ideal !
Parsing [sent. 2514 len. 12]: Sweet little Pixie , of course , was a beguiling creature .
Parsing [sent. 2515 len. 46]: Stanor would not admit any shortcomings in his _ fiancee _ , but he did allow himself to wonder tentatively if he had spoken too soon : if she were not , perhaps , a trifle young to understand the meaning of the new claim .
Parsing [sent. 2516 len. 37]: The daily interviews which he had been vouchsafed had been full of interest and charm , but they had not succeeded in stifling the doubt which had marred the first minutes of acceptance , for alas !
Parsing [sent. 2517 len. 20]: it was when Pixie was the most affectionate that her lover was most acutely conscious of the subtle want .
Parsing [sent. 2518 len. 19]: And then , as if there was not already enough worry and trouble , there was the Runkle .
Parsing [sent. 2519 len. 12]: ... The Runkle would be bound to put in his oar !
Parsing [sent. 2520 len. 36]: Stanor had delayed sending word of his engagement to the man who stood to him in the place of a father , silencing his conscience by the assertion that there was yet nothing to announce .
Parsing [sent. 2521 len. 30]: Until Pixie 's guardians came down from their present unnatural position , there might be an understanding , but there could not be said to be a formal engagement .
Parsing [sent. 2522 len. 13]: It was Pixie herself who finally forced him to dispatch the news .
Parsing [sent. 2523 len. 23]: It was Stanor 's first experience of arguing a point with a woman , and a most confusing experience he found it .
Parsing [sent. 2524 len. 61]: Pixie invariably agreed with every separate argument as he advanced it , saw eye to eye with him on each separate point , sympathised warmly with his scruples , and then at the very moment when she was expected to say `` yes '' to the final decision , said `` no , '' and stuck to it with conviction .
Parsing [sent. 2525 len. 40]: Questioned as to the reason of such inconsistency , she had only one excuse to plead , and she pled it so often and with such insistence that it seemed easier to give in than to continue the argument .
Parsing [sent. 2526 len. 9]: `` Yes , but he 's lame ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2527 len. 23]: came back automatically as the answer to every remonstrance , till Stanor shrugged his shoulders and sat down to write his letter .
Parsing [sent. 2528 len. 18]: Pixie _ was _ indeed , as the family had it , `` the soft-heartedest creature ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2529 len. 15]: He loved her for it , but none the less depression seized him anew .
Parsing [sent. 2530 len. 9]: Now there would be the Runkle to tackle !
Parsing [sent. 2531 len. 3]: More arguments !
Parsing [sent. 2532 len. 3]: More objections !
Parsing [sent. 2533 len. 49]: A fellow ought to be jolly happy when he was married , to make up for all the fuss and agitation which went before ... Stanor 's letter of announcement was short and to the point , for he was not in the mood to lapse into sentiment .
Parsing [sent. 2534 len. 54]: By return of post came the Runkle 's reply , short also , and non-committal -- nothing more , in fact , than the announcement that he preferred to discuss the matter in person , and would the following day arrive at a certain hotel , where he bade his nephew meet him .
Parsing [sent. 2535 len. 41]: Stanor therefore made his excuses to his hostess , packed his bag , and dispatched a letter of explanation to his _ fiancee _ , unconscious of the fact that she was at that very hour receiving information first hand .
Parsing [sent. 2536 len. 12]: It came about in the most natural , and simple fashion .
Parsing [sent. 2537 len. 45]: As Pixie , roaming the grounds bareheaded to gather a bouquet of wild flowers to present to the little invalid , emerged suddenly upon the drive , she found a tall , grey-coated stranger leaning against a tree in an attitude expressive of collapse .
Parsing [sent. 2538 len. 35]: He was very tall , and very thin ; the framework of his shoulders was high and broad , but from them the coat seemed to flap around a mere skeleton of a frame .
Parsing [sent. 2539 len. 39]: His hair was dark , his complexion pale , and leaning back with closed eyes he looked so alarmingly ill and spent , that , dropping the flowers to the ground , Pixie leaped forward to the rescue .
Parsing [sent. 2540 len. 5]: `` You 're ill .
Parsing [sent. 2541 len. 5]: ... Let me help !
Parsing [sent. 2542 len. 7]: There 's a seat close by .
Parsing [sent. 2543 len. 6]: ... Lean on me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2544 len. 53]: The stranger opened his eyes , and Pixie started as most people _ did _ start when they first looked into Stephen Glynn 's eyes , which were of that deep , intense blue which is romantically dubbed purple and fringed with dark lashes , which added still further to their depth .
Parsing [sent. 2545 len. 22]: They were sad eyes , tired eyes , eyes of an exceeding and pitiful beauty , eloquent of suffering and repression .
Parsing [sent. 2546 len. 23]: They looked out under dark , level brows , and with their intense earnestness of expression flooded the thin face with life .
Parsing [sent. 2547 len. 15]: As she met their gaze Pixie drew a quick , gasping breath of surprise .
Parsing [sent. 2548 len. 30]: The stranger in his turn looked surprised and startled ; he bent his head in involuntary salute , and glanced down at the tiny arm offered for his support .
Parsing [sent. 2549 len. 26]: Six foot two he stood in his stockinged feet , and there was this scrap of a girl offering her little doll-like arm for support !
Parsing [sent. 2550 len. 15]: His lips twitched , and Pixie pounced on the meaning with her usual agility .
Parsing [sent. 2551 len. 11]: `` But I 'm wiry , '' she announced proudly .
Parsing [sent. 2552 len. 12]: `` You would n't believe my strength till you try it .
Parsing [sent. 2553 len. 6]: Just for a few yards .
Parsing [sent. 2554 len. 8]: ... Round the corner by the oak-tree .
Parsing [sent. 2555 len. 5]: _ Please _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2556 len. 6]: `` You are too kind .
Parsing [sent. 2557 len. 24]: I am not ill , but the walk from the station is very steep and I found it tiring , that 's all .
Parsing [sent. 2558 len. 20]: I shall be glad to rest for a moment , but I assure you no help is needed . ''
Parsing [sent. 2559 len. 29]: He took a step forward as he spoke , a quick , halting step , and Pixie looking on , exclaimed sharply -- '' _ The Runkle _ !
Parsing [sent. 2560 len. 4]: Stanor 's Runkle !
Parsing [sent. 2561 len. 7]: It is _ You _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2562 len. 13]: The stranger looked down sharply , his dark brows puckering in astonishment .
Parsing [sent. 2563 len. 20]: `` I am Stephen Glynn -- ` The Runkle , ' as my nephew is pleased to call me .
Parsing [sent. 2564 len. 13]: But you -- you can not be -- '' Pixie nodded vehemently .
Parsing [sent. 2565 len. 6]: `` I _ am _ !
Parsing [sent. 2566 len. 4]: -- Pixie O'Shaughnessy .
Parsing [sent. 2567 len. 6]: Going to be your niece .
Parsing [sent. 2568 len. 8]: I made Stanor write to tell you .
Parsing [sent. 2569 len. 34]: -- '' They seated themselves on the bench under the oak-tree , and turning , faced each other in a long , curious silence , during which each face assumed a puzzled expression .
Parsing [sent. 2570 len. 10]: `` But you are younger than I expected ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2571 len. 3]: cried Pixie .
Parsing [sent. 2572 len. 22]: `` That is exactly what I was on the point of saying to _ you _ , '' returned Mr Glynn .
Parsing [sent. 2573 len. 17]: `` And yet we know exactly how old we both are -- twenty and thirty-five ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2574 len. 4]: Pixie continued volubly .
Parsing [sent. 2575 len. 18]: `` But you know how it is with young men -- they have no patience to explain !
Parsing [sent. 2576 len. 20]: You 'd be amused if you could see the image I 'd made of you in my own mind .
Parsing [sent. 2577 len. 10]: I expect 't was the same with yourself ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2578 len. 43]: `` It was , '' agreed Mr Glynn , and for a moment imagined that his disappointment was his own secret -- only for a moment , however , then Pixie tilted her head at him with a sideways nod of comprehension .
Parsing [sent. 2579 len. 17]: `` Knowing , of course , that I was a sister of the beautiful Mrs Hilliard !
Parsing [sent. 2580 len. 7]: No wonder you are disappointed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2581 len. 18]: The eyes smiled sympathy at him , and the wide lips parted in the friendliest of smiles .
Parsing [sent. 2582 len. 12]: `` You 'll like me better when you know me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2583 len. 32]: `` I -- I am quite sure , '' stammered Mr Glynn , and then drew himself up suddenly , as if doubtful if agreement were altogether polite under the circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 2584 len. 21]: Once more his lips twitched , and as their eyes met he and Pixie collapsed together into an irresistible laugh .
Parsing [sent. 2585 len. 18]: He laughed well , a rare and charming accomplishment , and Pixie regarded him with benign approval .
Parsing [sent. 2586 len. 8]: `` Quite romantic , is n't it ?
Parsing [sent. 2587 len. 40]: The noble kinsman journeying in state to demand the hand of the charming maid , falls ill of the perils of the way , and encounters a simple cottage maid gathering flowers , who succours the stranger in distress .
Parsing [sent. 2588 len. 6]: Their identity is then revealed .
Parsing [sent. 2589 len. 9]: ... I _ do _ love romances ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2590 len. 4]: cried Pixie gushingly .
Parsing [sent. 2591 len. 25]: `` And it 's much nicer having an interview out here than in a stuffy room ... Please , Mr Kinsman -- begin ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2592 len. 29]: He frowned , bit at his under lip , and moved restlessly on the seat , glancing once and again at the girl 's bright , unclouded face .
Parsing [sent. 2593 len. 23]: `` I 'm afraid , '' he began slowly , `` that the matter is not altogether as simple as you suppose .
Parsing [sent. 2594 len. 12]: Stanor is not in a position to marry without my consent .
Parsing [sent. 2595 len. 10]: I think he has not sufficiently appreciated this fact .
Parsing [sent. 2596 len. 28]: If he had consulted me in the first instance I should have endeavoured to prevent -- '' She turned her eyes upon him like a frightened child .
Parsing [sent. 2597 len. 32]: There was no trace of anger , nor wounded pride -- those he could have faced with ease -- but the simple shock of the young face smote on his heart .
Parsing [sent. 2598 len. 10]: `` I had not seen you , remember ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2599 len. 4]: he cried quickly .
Parsing [sent. 2600 len. 8]: `` My decision had no personal element .
Parsing [sent. 2601 len. 13]: I object at this stage to Stanor becoming engaged to -- anybody .
Parsing [sent. 2602 len. 12]: He has , no doubt , explained to you our relationship .
Parsing [sent. 2603 len. 13]: His parents being dead , I made myself responsible for his training .
Parsing [sent. 2604 len. 29]: He may have explained to you also my wish that for a few years he should be free to enjoy his youth without any sense of responsibility ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2605 len. 4]: Pixie nodded gravely .
Parsing [sent. 2606 len. 4]: `` He has .
Parsing [sent. 2607 len. 3]: I understood .
Parsing [sent. 2608 len. 47]: You had missed those years yourself , and knew they could never come back , so you gave them to him as a gift -- young , happy years without a care , that he could treasure up in his mind and remember all his life .
Parsing [sent. 2609 len. 6]: 'T was a big gift !
Parsing [sent. 2610 len. 22]: Stanor , and I are grateful to you -- '' Stephen Glynn looked at her : a long , thoughtful glance .
Parsing [sent. 2611 len. 19]: The programme which he had mapped out for his nephew had been unusual enough to attract much notice .
Parsing [sent. 2612 len. 25]: He had been alternately annoyed and amused by the criticism of his neighbours , all of whom seemed incapable of understanding his real motives .
Parsing [sent. 2613 len. 23]: It seemed a strange thing that it should be reserved for this slip of a girl to see into his inmost heart .
Parsing [sent. 2614 len. 19]: He was touched and impressed , but that `` Stanor and I '' hardened him to his task .
Parsing [sent. 2615 len. 4]: `` Thank you .
Parsing [sent. 2616 len. 6]: You _ do _ understand .
Parsing [sent. 2617 len. 32]: At the moment Stanor may perhaps be inclined to question the wisdom of my programme , but I think in after years he will , as you say , look back .
Parsing [sent. 2618 len. 18]: The fact remains , however , that he has not yet tackled the real business of life .
Parsing [sent. 2619 len. 37]: He has had , with my concurrence , plenty of change and variety , which I believe in the end will prove of service in his life 's work , and he has stood the test .
Parsing [sent. 2620 len. 12]: Many young fellows of his age would have abused their opportunities .
Parsing [sent. 2621 len. 6]: He has not done so .
Parsing [sent. 2622 len. 38]: My only disappointment has been that he has developed no definite taste , but has been content to flit from one fancy to the next , always carried away by the latest novelty on the horizon . ''
Parsing [sent. 2623 len. 16]: Once again she tilted her head and scanned him with her wide , clear eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2624 len. 8]: `` You mean _ Me _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2625 len. 4]: she said quickly .
Parsing [sent. 2626 len. 9]: `` I 'm the ` Latest Novelty ! '
Parsing [sent. 2627 len. 11]: You mean that he 'll change about me , too ?
Parsing [sent. 2628 len. 8]: Is n't that what you mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2629 len. 38]: `` My dear -- Miss O'Shaughnessy , '' -LRB- incredible though it appeared , Stephen had been on the verge of saying `` Pixie , '' pure and simple -RRB- `` you leap too hastily to conclusions .
Parsing [sent. 2630 len. 10]: I am afraid I must appear an odious person !
Parsing [sent. 2631 len. 21]: Believe me , I had no intention of rushing into the very heart of this matter as we have done .
Parsing [sent. 2632 len. 34]: My plan was to call upon your sister and explain to her my position -- '' '' 'T is not my sister 's business , 't is mine , '' interrupted Pixie firmly .
Parsing [sent. 2633 len. 23]: `` And it would be a waste of time talking to her , for she 'd agree with every word you said .
Parsing [sent. 2634 len. 11]: They do n't _ want _ me to be engaged .
Parsing [sent. 2635 len. 7]: They think I 'm too young .
Parsing [sent. 2636 len. 14]: If you have anything to say , say it to _ Me _ .
Parsing [sent. 2637 len. 11]: _ I 'm _ the person to be convinced . ''
Parsing [sent. 2638 len. 32]: She settled herself more comfortably as she spoke , turning towards him with one arm resting on the back of the bench , and her head leaning against the upturned hand .
Parsing [sent. 2639 len. 11]: The sun shone on her face through the flickering branches .
Parsing [sent. 2640 len. 21]: No , she was not pretty ; not in the least the sort of girl Stanor was accustomed to fancy .
Parsing [sent. 2641 len. 27]: Yet there was something extraordinarily attractive about the little face , with its clear eyes , its wide , generous mouth , its vivacity of expression .
Parsing [sent. 2642 len. 32]: Already , after a bare ten minutes ' acquaintance , Stephen Glynn so shrank from the prospect of hurting Pixie O'Shaughnessy that it required an effort to keep an unflinching front .
Parsing [sent. 2643 len. 31]: `` I agree with your people , '' he said resolutely , `` that you and Stanor are too young , and that this matter has been settled too hastily .
Parsing [sent. 2644 len. 22]: Apart from that , I should object to any engagement until he has proved his ability to work for a wife .
Parsing [sent. 2645 len. 17]: I have a position in view for him in a large mercantile house in New York .
Parsing [sent. 2646 len. 37]: After a couple of years ' experience there he would come back to the London house , and , if his work justified it , I am prepared to buy him a partnership in the firm .
Parsing [sent. 2647 len. 34]: He would then be his own master , free to do as he chose , but for these two years he must be free , with no other responsibility than this work . ''
Parsing [sent. 2648 len. 26]: `` You think , '' queried Pixie slowly , `` that I should interfere ... that he would do his work better without me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2649 len. 12]: `` It 's not a question of thinking , Miss O'Shaughnessy .
Parsing [sent. 2650 len. 7]: I am not content to think .
Parsing [sent. 2651 len. 21]: I want to make _ sure _ that Stanor will settle seriously to work and keep in the same mind .
Parsing [sent. 2652 len. 23]: He is a good fellow , a dear fellow , but , hitherto at least , he has not been stable . ''
Parsing [sent. 2653 len. 9]: `` He has never been engaged before ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2654 len. 4]: `` Not actually .
Parsing [sent. 2655 len. 13]: I have been forewarned in time to prevent matters reaching that length .
Parsing [sent. 2656 len. 12]: Twice over -- '' A small hand waved imperiously for silence .
Parsing [sent. 2657 len. 26]: `` I do n't _ think _ , '' said Pixie sternly , `` that you have any right to tell me things like that .
Parsing [sent. 2658 len. 13]: If Stanor wants me to know , he can tell me himself .
Parsing [sent. 2659 len. 5]: It 's his affair .
Parsing [sent. 2660 len. 8]: I am not at all curious . ''
Parsing [sent. 2661 len. 47]: She drew a fluttering breath , and stared down at the ground , and a silence followed during which Stephen was denouncing himself as a hard-hearted tyrant , when suddenly a minute voice spoke in his ear -- `` Were they -- _ pretty _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2662 len. 13]: It was impossible to resist the smile which twitched at his lips .
Parsing [sent. 2663 len. 26]: Unpleasant as was the nature of his errand , he , the most unsmiling of men , had already twice over been moved to merriment .
Parsing [sent. 2664 len. 18]: Stephen was reflecting on the incongruity of the fact , when Pixie again answered his unspoken retort .
Parsing [sent. 2665 len. 10]: `` It 's not curiosity , it 's interest .
Parsing [sent. 2666 len. 7]: _ Quite _ a different thing !
Parsing [sent. 2667 len. 44]: And even if they _ were _ , it 's much more serious when a man cares for a girl for her -- er -- mental attractions , because they go on getting better , instead of fading away like a pretty face .
Parsing [sent. 2668 len. 10]: It 's very difficult to know what is right .
Parsing [sent. 2669 len. 36]: ... I 've promised Stanor , and he has promised me , and it seems a poor way of showing that you know your own mind , to break your word at the beginning ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2670 len. 21]: `` I do n't ask you to break your word , Miss O'Shaughnessy ; only to hold it in abeyance .
Parsing [sent. 2671 len. 15]: I am speaking in Stanor 's interests , which we have equally at heart .
Parsing [sent. 2672 len. 8]: I know his character -- forgive me !
Parsing [sent. 2673 len. 31]: -- better than you can do , and I am asking you to help me in arranging a probation which I _ know _ to be wise under the circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 2674 len. 62]: Let him go to New York a free man ; let him work and show his mettle , and at the end of two years , if you are both of the same mind , I will give you every help in my power : but meantime there must be no engagement , no _ tie _ , no regular correspondence .
Parsing [sent. 2675 len. 7]: You must both be perfectly free .
Parsing [sent. 2676 len. 25]: I am sorry to appear hard-hearted , but these are my conditions , and I ca n't see my way to alter them . ''
Parsing [sent. 2677 len. 7]: `` Well -- why not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2678 len. 4]: cried Pixie unexpectedly .
Parsing [sent. 2679 len. 6]: `` What 's two years ?
Parsing [sent. 2680 len. 7]: They 'll pass in no time .
Parsing [sent. 2681 len. 5]: And men hate writing .
Parsing [sent. 2682 len. 13]: Stanor will be relieved not to have to bother about the mails .
Parsing [sent. 2683 len. 6]: He can do without letters .
Parsing [sent. 2684 len. 9]: He will know that I am waiting . ''
Parsing [sent. 2685 len. 12]: She held out her hand with a sudden , radiant smile .
Parsing [sent. 2686 len. 9]: `` And _ you _ will be pleased !
Parsing [sent. 2687 len. 12]: It is the least we can do to consider your wishes .
Parsing [sent. 2688 len. 35]: If I persuade Stanor -- if I send him away alone to work , '' the small fingers tightened ingratiatingly over his , `` you _ will _ like me , wo n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 2689 len. 11]: You will think of me as a real niece ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2690 len. 11]: Stephen Glynn 's deep blue eyes stared deeply into hers .
Parsing [sent. 2691 len. 47]: He did not deliberately intend to put his thoughts into speech ; if he had given himself a moment to think he would certainly not have done so , but so strong was the mental conviction that the words seemed to form themselves without his volition .
Parsing [sent. 2692 len. 7]: `` You do n't love him !
Parsing [sent. 2693 len. 33]: You could not face a separation so easily if you loved him as you should ... '' For the first time a flash of real anger showed itself on Pixie 's face .
Parsing [sent. 2694 len. 20]: Her features hardened ; the child disappeared and he caught a glimpse of the woman that was to be .
Parsing [sent. 2695 len. 10]: `` What right have you to say that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2696 len. 4]: she asked deeply .
Parsing [sent. 2697 len. 28]: `` You prove to me that it would be for Stanor 's good to wait , and then say I can not love him because I agree !
Parsing [sent. 2698 len. 22]: _ You _ love him , yet you can hurt him and bring him disappointment when you feel it is right .
Parsing [sent. 2699 len. 21]: I understood that , so I was not angry , but in return you might understand _ me _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2700 len. 5]: `` Forgive me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2701 len. 3]: cried Stephen .
Parsing [sent. 2702 len. 8]: `` I should not have said it .
Parsing [sent. 2703 len. 9]: You deserved a better return for your kindness .
Parsing [sent. 2704 len. 24]: I suppose I must seem very illogical , but it did not occur to me that the two cases were on a parallel .
Parsing [sent. 2705 len. 25]: The love of a _ fiancee _ is not as a rule as well balanced as that of an uncle , Miss O'Shaughnessy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2706 len. 12]: `` It _ ought _ to be , '' asserted Pixie .
Parsing [sent. 2707 len. 14]: `` It ought to be everything that another love is , and more !
Parsing [sent. 2708 len. 40]: A man 's future wife ought to be the person of all others to be reasonable , and unselfish , and logical where he is concerned , even if it means separation for a _ dozen _ years . ''
Parsing [sent. 2709 len. 3]: No answer .
Parsing [sent. 2710 len. 13]: Stephen gazed blankly into space as if unconscious of her words . ''
Parsing [sent. 2711 len. 7]: _ Ought n't _ she ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2712 len. 14]: `` Er -- theoretically , Miss O'Shaughnessy , she _ ought _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2713 len. 6]: `` Very well , then .
Parsing [sent. 2714 len. 18]: I am proud that I _ am _ , and so ought you to be , too .
Parsing [sent. 2715 len. 9]: ... It 's strange how I 'm misunderstood !
Parsing [sent. 2716 len. 67]: My family say the same thing -- Esmeralda , Geoffrey , Stanor himself , and it hurts , for no one before has ever doubted if I could love ... '' She was silent for a minute , twisting her fingers together in restless fashion , then looking suddenly into his face she asked : `` What do you know about it to be so sure ?
Parsing [sent. 2717 len. 10]: Have _ you _ ever been in love ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2718 len. 3]: Stephen flushed .
Parsing [sent. 2719 len. 3]: `` Never .
Parsing [sent. 2720 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 2721 len. 14]: I was -- My accident cut me off from all such things . ''
Parsing [sent. 2722 len. 5]: `` What a pity !
Parsing [sent. 2723 len. 8]: She would have helped you through . ''
Parsing [sent. 2724 len. 10]: She smiled into his eyes with a beautiful sweetness .
Parsing [sent. 2725 len. 23]: `` Well , Mr Glynn , if I am too reasonable to please you , perhaps Stanor will make up for it .
Parsing [sent. 2726 len. 14]: You may n't find it so easy to influence _ him _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 2727 len. 7]: `` I 'm sure of that .
Parsing [sent. 2728 len. 21]: I look forward to a stiff time , but if you are on my side we shall bring him round .
Parsing [sent. 2729 len. 16]: Now perhaps I had better continue my way to the house and see Mrs Hilliard .
Parsing [sent. 2730 len. 20]: This is pre-eminently your business , as you say , but still -- '' `` She 'll expect it !
Parsing [sent. 2731 len. 22]: Yes -- '' Pixie rose to her feet with an air of depression -- `` and she 'll _ crow _ !
Parsing [sent. 2732 len. 7]: They 'll _ all _ crow !
Parsing [sent. 2733 len. 23]: It 's what they wanted , and when you come and lay down an ultimatum , they 'll rejoice and triumph . ''
Parsing [sent. 2734 len. 10]: Her small face assumed an aspect of acute dejection .
Parsing [sent. 2735 len. 10]: `` That 's the worst of being the youngest .
Parsing [sent. 2736 len. 28]: ... It 's a trying thing when your family insist on sitting in committees about your own affairs , when you understand them so much better yourself .
Parsing [sent. 2737 len. 22]: I 'm not even supposed to understand the feelings of my own heart without a sister to translate them for me .
Parsing [sent. 2738 len. 23]: Should n't you think , now , a girl of twenty -- nearly twenty-one -- is old enough to know that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2739 len. 11]: `` I do n't think it is a foregone conclusion .
Parsing [sent. 2740 len. 36]: More things than years go to the formation of character , Miss O'Shaughnessy , and if you will allow me to say so , you seem to me very young for your age . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 2741 len. 11]: _ I _ always was , '' sighed Pixie sadly .
Parsing [sent. 2742 len. 9]: `` They 've said that all my life .
Parsing [sent. 2743 len. 13]: Some people always _ are _ young , and some are old .
Parsing [sent. 2744 len. 21]: There was a girl at school , middle-aged at thirteen , poor creature , and had been from her birth .
Parsing [sent. 2745 len. 25]: My sister Bridgie will never be more than seventeen if she lives to a hundred , and I mean myself to stick at twenty .
Parsing [sent. 2746 len. 36]: It does n't mean trying to look younger than you are , or being ashamed of your age , and silly , and frivolous : it 's just keeping your _ heart _ young ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2747 len. 24]: The man , who was young in years and old in heart , looked down at the girl with a very sad smile .
Parsing [sent. 2748 len. 34]: She spoke as if it were such an easy thing to do : he knew by bitter experience that under such circumstances as his own it was of all tasks the most difficult .
Parsing [sent. 2749 len. 83]: To stand aside during the best years ; to see the tide of life rush by , and have no part in the great enterprise ; and then to regain his powers when youth had passed , and the keen savour of youth had died down into a dull indifference ; to be dependent for love on the careless affection of a lad , -- how was it possible for a man to keep his heart warm in such circumstances as these ?
Parsing [sent. 2750 len. 31]: `` Life has been kind to you , '' he answered dryly , and Pixie flung him a quick retort -- `` I have been kind to _ it _ !
Parsing [sent. 2751 len. 12]: If I 'd chosen I might have found it hard enough .
Parsing [sent. 2752 len. 5]: We were always poor .
Parsing [sent. 2753 len. 25]: I never remember a time when I had n't to pretend and make up , because it was impossible to get what I wanted .
Parsing [sent. 2754 len. 52]: Then I was sent to school , and I hated going , and my father died when I was away , and they told me the news with not a soul belonging to me anywhere near , and I loved my father _ far _ more than other girls love theirs !
Parsing [sent. 2755 len. 6]: ... Then we left Knock .
Parsing [sent. 2756 len. 48]: ... If _ you 'd _ lived in a castle , and gone to a villa in a street , with a parlour in front and a dining-room behind looking out on the kitchen wall , _ you _ would n't talk about life being kind -- !
Parsing [sent. 2757 len. 27]: `` I was in France for years being educated , and not able to repine because it was a friend and she 'd taken me cheaply .
Parsing [sent. 2758 len. 65]: Perhaps you 'd say that was luck , and an advantage , and it _ was _ , but all the same it 's hard on a young thing to have to enjoy herself in a foreign language , and spend the holidays with a maiden lady and a snuffy old _ Pere _ , because there was n't enough money to come home .
Parsing [sent. 2759 len. 38]: Yes , '' concluded Pixie , with a smirk of satisfaction , `` I 've had my trials , and now I 'm to be crossed in love , and have my young lover rent from me .
Parsing [sent. 2760 len. 15]: ... You could n't have the audacity to call life easy after that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2761 len. 34]: Stephen tried valiantly to look sympathetic , but it was useless ; he was obliged to smile , and Pixie smiled with him , adding cheerily -- `` Anyway , it 's living !
Parsing [sent. 2762 len. 10]: ... And I do love it when things happen .
Parsing [sent. 2763 len. 12]: It 's so _ dreadfully _ interesting to be alive . ''
Parsing [sent. 2764 len. 18]: The man who was old before his time looked down upon the girl with a wistful glance .
Parsing [sent. 2765 len. 26]: Small as she was , insignificant as she had appeared at first sight , he had never seen any one more intensely , vitally alive .
Parsing [sent. 2766 len. 40]: Her tiny feet skimmed the ground , her tiny head reared itself jauntily on the slender neck , the brilliance of her smile , the embracing kindliness of her glance more than compensated for the plainness of her features .
Parsing [sent. 2767 len. 31]: Like most people who made the acquaintance of Pixie O'Shaughnessy , Stephen Glynn was already beginning to fall under her spell and marvel at the blindness of his first impression .
Parsing [sent. 2768 len. 26]: She was _ not _ plain ; she was _ not _ insignificant ; she was , on the contrary , unusually fascinating and attractive !
Parsing [sent. 2769 len. 14]: `` But she does not love him , '' Stephen repeated to himself .
Parsing [sent. 2770 len. 9]: `` She does not know what love means .
Parsing [sent. 2771 len. 27]: When she does -- when she has grown into a woman , and understands -- what a wife , what a companion she will make ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2772 len. 3]: CHAPTER SEVENTEEN .
Parsing [sent. 2773 len. 3]: THINKING ALIKE .
Parsing [sent. 2774 len. 27]: Pixie 's prophecy that her relatives would `` crow '' on hearing Mr Glynn 's ultimatum , was fulfilled in spirit , if not in letter .
Parsing [sent. 2775 len. 101]: Geoffrey and Joan Hilliard assumed their most staid and dignified airs for the important interview , referred to `` my sister Patricia '' with a deference worthy of a royal princess , and would have Stanor 's guardian to understand that the man was not born who was worthy to be her spouse ; all the same , as mortal young men went , they had nothing to say against Stanor Vaughan , and if time proved him to be in earnest , both in love and work , they would be graciously pleased to welcome him into the family .
Parsing [sent. 2776 len. 40]: Then , the business part of the interview being ended , the ambassador was invited to stay to lunch , and Esmeralda swept from the room , leaving the two men to a less formal colloquy over their cigarettes .
Parsing [sent. 2777 len. 29]: `` It 's a comfort to find that we think alike on this matter , '' began Geoffrey , holding out a match for his guest 's benefit .
Parsing [sent. 2778 len. 24]: `` I have felt rather guilty about it , for Pixie was left too much to herself during our little fellow 's illness .
Parsing [sent. 2779 len. 23]: She was in trouble herself , poor little soul , and , being lonely , was no doubt unduly susceptible to sympathy .
Parsing [sent. 2780 len. 37]: Neither my wife nor I suspected any attachment before the night of the boy 's accident , and if things had gone on in a normal way I doubt if the engagement would have come off .
Parsing [sent. 2781 len. 18]: Pixie is very young ; we have hardly accustomed ourselves to the idea that she is grown-up .
Parsing [sent. 2782 len. 20]: This is the first visit she had paid to us by herself , so that we feel responsible . ''
Parsing [sent. 2783 len. 8]: `` You are uncertain of her feelings ?
Parsing [sent. 2784 len. 18]: I had the same doubt myself , but when I said as much Miss O'Shaughnessy was indignant .
Parsing [sent. 2785 len. 10]: She insists that she does love the boy . ''
Parsing [sent. 2786 len. 4]: Geoffrey Hilliard laughed .
Parsing [sent. 2787 len. 17]: `` It would be difficult to find the person whom Pixie does _ not _ love .
Parsing [sent. 2788 len. 15]: He is handsome , and he was kind to her when she was lonely .
Parsing [sent. 2789 len. 11]: She loves him as she loves a dozen other friends .
Parsing [sent. 2790 len. 9]: But -- '' '' _ But _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2791 len. 5]: repeated Stephen Glynn eloquently .
Parsing [sent. 2792 len. 22]: He who had missed the greatest of earthly gifts yet realised enough of its mystery to join in that eloquent protest .
Parsing [sent. 2793 len. 15]: He smoked in silence for several moments , while his thoughts wandered backwards . ''
Parsing [sent. 2794 len. 10]: _ She would have helped you through _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2795 len. 30]: The echo of those words rang in his ears ; he heard again the musical tone of the soft Irish voice , saw again the sweet , deep glance .
Parsing [sent. 2796 len. 17]: Strange that those words had in the very moment of utterance uprooted the conviction of years !
Parsing [sent. 2797 len. 36]: Lying prisoner on his couch , he had been thankful , in a grim , embittered fashion which had belied the true meaning of the word , that love had not entered into his life .
Parsing [sent. 2798 len. 26]: It would have been but another cross to bear , since no woman could be expected to be faithful to a maimed and querulous invalid .
Parsing [sent. 2799 len. 28]: Now in a lightning flash he realised that there were women -- this Irish Pixie , for example -- whose love could triumphantly overcome such an ordeal .
Parsing [sent. 2800 len. 31]: _ She _ would have '' _ helped him through _ '' and , supported and cheered by her influence , his recovery would doubtless have been far more speedy .
Parsing [sent. 2801 len. 17]: He straightened himself , and said quickly -- `` Miss O'Shaughnessy would make a charming wife .
Parsing [sent. 2802 len. 29]: For Stanor 's sake I could not wish anything better than that she may be ready to fulfil her promise at the end of the two years . ''
Parsing [sent. 2803 len. 13]: `` There 's no doubt about that , '' said Geoffrey gravely .
Parsing [sent. 2804 len. 6]: `` She will be ready .
Parsing [sent. 2805 len. 34]: There 's more than a grain of obstinacy in Pixie 's nature -- very amiable obstinacy , no doubt , but it may be just as mischievous on such occasions as the present .
Parsing [sent. 2806 len. 23]: She has given her word and she 'll stick to it , even if she recognises that she has made a mistake .
Parsing [sent. 2807 len. 11]: We may talk , but it will have no effect .
Parsing [sent. 2808 len. 23]: Unless your nephew himself releases her , she will feel as much bound as if they had been married in Westminster Abbey .
Parsing [sent. 2809 len. 17]: It 's the way she 's made -- the most faithful little creature under the sun !
Parsing [sent. 2810 len. 56]: It will be our duty to protect her against herself , by making the young fellow understand that for her sake , almost more than his own , he must be honest , and not allow a mistaken sense of honour to urge him to repeat his proposal if his heart is not in it .
Parsing [sent. 2811 len. 15]: He could make Pixie his wife , but he could never make her happy .
Parsing [sent. 2812 len. 27]: The most cruel fate that could happen to that little soul would be to be married to a man who did not love her absolutely ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2813 len. 12]: Stephen Glynn nodded , his lips pressed together in grim determination .
Parsing [sent. 2814 len. 5]: `` He shall understand .
Parsing [sent. 2815 len. 15]: If I know Stanor , there will be no difficulty , in persuading him .
Parsing [sent. 2816 len. 16]: He is a good lad , but it is not in him to sacrifice himself .
Parsing [sent. 2817 len. 28]: I have been so anxious to secure him an unclouded youth that he is hardly to be blamed for putting his own interests in the foreground . ''
Parsing [sent. 2818 len. 22]: `` It 's a fault that many of us suffer from in the early twenties , '' said Geoffrey , lightly .
Parsing [sent. 2819 len. 40]: He thought the conversation had lasted long enough , and was glad when the sound of the gong came as an interruption and he could escort his guest to the dining-room , where the two ladies were already waiting .
Parsing [sent. 2820 len. 33]: Luncheon was a cheerful meal despite the somewhat difficult position of the diners , and Stephen Glynn felt the pang of the lonely as he absorbed the atmosphere of love and sympathy .
Parsing [sent. 2821 len. 35]: The beautiful hostess looked tired and worn , but her eyes brightened as she looked at her husband , and , in a quiet , unostentatious fashion , he watched incessantly over her comfort .
Parsing [sent. 2822 len. 58]: It was easy to see that the trial through which this husband and wife had passed had but riveted the bond between them and brought them into closest sympathy , while the little sister comported herself with a brisk cheeriness which was as far as possible removed from the attitude of the proverbial damsel crossed in love .
Parsing [sent. 2823 len. 20]: The time passed so pleasantly that the visitor was unfeignedly sorry when it was time to make his farewells .
Parsing [sent. 2824 len. 30]: Pixie ran upstairs for the small son and heir , who had by now returned home , and in her absence Stephen exchanged a few last words with Esmeralda .
Parsing [sent. 2825 len. 19]: `` I am immensely relieved and thankful that you and your husband feel with me in this matter .
Parsing [sent. 2826 len. 8]: And Miss O'Shaughnessy has been wonderfully forgiving !
Parsing [sent. 2827 len. 11]: She does not appear to bear me any rancour . ''
Parsing [sent. 2828 len. 9]: Esmeralda gave a short , impatient laugh . ''
Parsing [sent. 2829 len. 4]: _ Rancour _ !
Parsing [sent. 2830 len. 4]: _ Pixie _ !
Parsing [sent. 2831 len. 17]: You know very little of my sister , Mr Glynn , to suggest such a possibility .
Parsing [sent. 2832 len. 7]: She is incapable of rancour ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2833 len. 39]: Pixie returned at this moment , leading Geoff by the hand , and when the great car glided up to the door , she and the boy went out together to see the last of the departing guest .
Parsing [sent. 2834 len. 18]: Stephen stepped haltingly into the car , and leaned over the side to wave his own farewells .
Parsing [sent. 2835 len. 18]: Pixie smiled , and waved in reply , and the sun shone down on her uncovered face .
Parsing [sent. 2836 len. 59]: Stephen would have been thankful if he could have carried away that picture as a last impression , but as the car moved slowly from the door , she stepped back into the shadow of the porch , and he caught a last glimpse of her standing there , gazing after him with a grave , fixed gaze .
Parsing [sent. 2837 len. 3]: CHAPTER EIGHTEEN .
Parsing [sent. 2838 len. 7]: `` I WILL BE TRUE . ''
Parsing [sent. 2839 len. 51]: Stephen Glynn 's dreaded interview with his nephew was a typical example of the unexpectedness of events , for instead of the indignant opposition which he had feared , his proposition was listened to in silence , and accepted with an alacrity , which was almost more disconcerting than revolt .
Parsing [sent. 2840 len. 19]: In truth Stanor saw in the proposal an escape from what had proved a disappointing and humiliating position .
Parsing [sent. 2841 len. 29]: His pride had been hurt by the attitude of Pixie 's relatives , and he could not imagine himself visiting at their houses with any degree of enjoyment .
Parsing [sent. 2842 len. 34]: A dragging engagement in England would therefore be a trying experience to all concerned , and it seemed a very good way out of the difficulty to pass the time of waiting abroad .
Parsing [sent. 2843 len. 34]: From his own point of view , moreover , he was relieved not to begin his business life in London , where so far he had been free to pursue his pleasures only .
Parsing [sent. 2844 len. 62]: To be cooped up in a dull city office , while but a mile or two away his friends were taking part in the social functions of the season , would be an exasperating experience , whereas in New York he would be troubled by no such comparisons , but would find much to enjoy in the novelty of his surroundings .
Parsing [sent. 2845 len. 28]: Two years would soon pass , and at the end he would come home to an assured position , marry Pixie , and live happily ever after .
Parsing [sent. 2846 len. 42]: He sat gazing thoughtfully into space , the fingers of his right hand slowly stroking his chin , a picture of handsome , young manhood , while the deep blue eyes of Stephen Glynn watched him intently from across the room .
Parsing [sent. 2847 len. 27]: A long minute of silence ; then the two pairs of eyes met , and Stanor found himself flushing with a discomfort as acute as mysterious .
Parsing [sent. 2848 len. 17]: He straightened himself , and put a hasty question -- `` What does Pixie say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2849 len. 24]: `` Miss O'Shaughnessy was -- '' Stephen hesitated over the word -- `` she seemed to think that my wishes should have weight .
Parsing [sent. 2850 len. 11]: She will consent to anything that seems for your good .
Parsing [sent. 2851 len. 10]: She said that two years would quickly pass . ''
Parsing [sent. 2852 len. 3]: Stanor frowned .
Parsing [sent. 2853 len. 26]: The thought had passed through his own brain , but no man could approve of such sentiments on the part of a _ fiancee _ .
Parsing [sent. 2854 len. 19]: There was an edge of irritation in his voice -- `` Of course your wishes should be considered .
Parsing [sent. 2855 len. 11]: I do n't need any one to teach me that .
Parsing [sent. 2856 len. 13]: I am quite willing to go to America and do my best .
Parsing [sent. 2857 len. 19]: I shall be glad of the change , but it 's nonsense to talk of not being bound .
Parsing [sent. 2858 len. 6]: We _ are _ bound !
Parsing [sent. 2859 len. 14]: We need not correspond regularly , if you make a point of that .
Parsing [sent. 2860 len. 11]: I do n't think much of letters in any case .
Parsing [sent. 2861 len. 18]: Writing once a week , or once in two or three months , can make no difference .
Parsing [sent. 2862 len. 11]: There 's only _ one _ thing that counts ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2863 len. 4]: Stephen assented gravely .
Parsing [sent. 2864 len. 4]: `` Just so .
Parsing [sent. 2865 len. 31]: From what I have seen of Miss O'Shaughnessy , I realise that her only hope of happiness is to marry a man who can give her a whole-hearted love . ''
Parsing [sent. 2866 len. 39]: Stanor 's glance held a mingling of surprise and displeasure -- surprise that the Runkle should offer any opinion at all on matters sentimental ; displeasure , that any one should dictate to him concerning Pixie 's welfare .
Parsing [sent. 2867 len. 10]: He switched the conversation back to more practical matters .
Parsing [sent. 2868 len. 6]: `` When shall I start ?
Parsing [sent. 2869 len. 5]: The sooner the better .
Parsing [sent. 2870 len. 14]: If the post is open there is no object in wasting time . ''
Parsing [sent. 2871 len. 8]: His face lit up with sudden animation .
Parsing [sent. 2872 len. 4]: `` I say !
Parsing [sent. 2873 len. 12]: Could we manage it in a fortnight , should you think ?
Parsing [sent. 2874 len. 24]: Miss Ward is sailing by the ` Louisiana , ' and it would be topping if I could go by the same boat .
Parsing [sent. 2875 len. 9]: I might wire to-day about a berth . ''
Parsing [sent. 2876 len. 7]: `` Who is Miss Ward ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2877 len. 7]: `` Honor Ward -- an American .
Parsing [sent. 2878 len. 3]: Awfully jolly !
Parsing [sent. 2879 len. 6]: No end of an heiress !
Parsing [sent. 2880 len. 25]: I 've met her a good deal this year , and she was staying at the Hilliards ' at the time of the accident .
Parsing [sent. 2881 len. 12]: Awfully fond of Pixie , and a real good sort ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2882 len. 4]: He laughed shortly .
Parsing [sent. 2883 len. 20]: -- `` We _ ought _ to go out together , for we are mentally in the same boat .
Parsing [sent. 2884 len. 19]: She had intended to stay over the summer , but ... her romance has gone wrong too ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2885 len. 4]: `` Indeed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2886 len. 44]: Stephen was not interested in Miss Ward 's romance , but he made no objection to the sending of a wire to the Liverpool office of the steamship company , and before evening the berth was secured and Stanor 's departure definitely dated .
Parsing [sent. 2887 len. 39]: `` I 'll spend the rest of the time with Pixie , '' was Stanor 's first determination , but each hour that passed brought with it a recollection of some new duty which must needs be performed .
Parsing [sent. 2888 len. 90]: One can not leave one 's native land , even for a couple of years , without a goodly amount of preparation and leave-taking , and the time allotted to Pixie dwindled down to a few hasty visits of a few hours ' duration , when the lovers sat together in the peacock walk , and talked , and built castles in the air , and laughed , and sighed , and occasionally indulged in a little , mild sparring , as very youthful lovers are apt to do .
Parsing [sent. 2889 len. 12]: `` I must say you are uncommonly complacent about my going !
Parsing [sent. 2890 len. 63]: A fellow hardly expects the girl he 's engaged to , to be in such uproarious spirits just on the eve of their separation , '' Stanor would grumble suddenly at the end of one of his _ fiancee 's _ mirthful sallies , whereupon Pixie , her vanity hurt by his want of appreciation , would snap out a quick retort .
Parsing [sent. 2891 len. 26]: `` If I 'm sad you want me to be glad , and if I 'm glad you 're annoyed that I 'm not sad !
Parsing [sent. 2892 len. 6]: There 's no pleasing you !
Parsing [sent. 2893 len. 13]: You ought to be thankful that I 'm so strong and self-controlled .
Parsing [sent. 2894 len. 18]: ... Would it make it easier ; if I were hanging round your neck in hysterics ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2895 len. 6]: `` Oh , bar hysterics !
Parsing [sent. 2896 len. 20]: But a tear or two now and then ... Suppose it was Bridgie who was going instead of me ?
Parsing [sent. 2897 len. 10]: -- would you be as strong and self-controlled ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2898 len. 44]: `` If Bridgie were going I 'd ... I 'd jump -- '' In the midst of her passionate declaration Pixie drew herself up , shot a frightened glance , and concluded lamely , `` I 'd ... be very much distressed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2899 len. 11]: `` That 's not what you were going to say .
Parsing [sent. 2900 len. 22]: You were going to say that you 'd jump into the water and swim after her , or some such nonsense .
Parsing [sent. 2901 len. 37]: You can be perfectly cool and calm about _ my going _ , but when it comes to Bridgie -- '' `` If it 'll please you better , I 'll begin to howl this minute !
Parsing [sent. 2902 len. 19]: I do n't often , but when I do , it seems as if I could never stop .
Parsing [sent. 2903 len. 41]: I _ thought _ , '' Pixie added reproachfully , `` when a girl was engaged the man thought her perfect , and everything she did , and she sat listening while he sang her praises from morn to night .
Parsing [sent. 2904 len. 24]: But _ you _ find fault -- '' `` I do n't call it finding fault to wish you would show more feeling !
Parsing [sent. 2905 len. 16]: It 's the best sort of compliment , if you could only see it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2906 len. 18]: `` I like my compliments undiluted , not wrapped up in reproaches , like powder in jam .
Parsing [sent. 2907 len. 8]: Besides , you 're fairly complacent yourself !
Parsing [sent. 2908 len. 16]: I heard you telling Geoffrey that you expected to have a real good time . ''
Parsing [sent. 2909 len. 6]: `` And suppose I did ?
Parsing [sent. 2910 len. 4]: What about that ?
Parsing [sent. 2911 len. 12]: Would you prefer me to be lonely , and miserable ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2912 len. 7]: `` Oh _ dear _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2913 len. 9]: cried Pixie poignantly ; `` we 're quarrelling !
Parsing [sent. 2914 len. 5]: Whose fault was it ?
Parsing [sent. 2915 len. 4]: Was it mine ?
Parsing [sent. 2916 len. 6]: I 'm sorry , Stanor .
Parsing [sent. 2917 len. 8]: _ Do n't _ let 's quarrel !
Parsing [sent. 2918 len. 7]: I want you to be happy .
Parsing [sent. 2919 len. 11]: Could I love you if I did n't do that ?
Parsing [sent. 2920 len. 8]: I want it more than anything else .
Parsing [sent. 2921 len. 17]: Honor is coming to-morrow , and I shall ask her to look after you for me .
Parsing [sent. 2922 len. 18]: She knows so many people , and is so rich that she has the power to help .
Parsing [sent. 2923 len. 10]: She will be glad to have you so near .
Parsing [sent. 2924 len. 14]: _ Why _ is she going home so _ soon _ , Stanor ?
Parsing [sent. 2925 len. 17]: I thought -- '' `` So did we all , but it 's fallen through somehow .
Parsing [sent. 2926 len. 22]: I met Carr in town looking the picture of woe , but , naturally , he did n't vouchsafe any explanation .
Parsing [sent. 2927 len. 10]: Honor will probably unburden herself to you to-morrow . ''
Parsing [sent. 2928 len. 4]: `` She will .
Parsing [sent. 2929 len. 14]: If she does n't I shall ask her , '' said Pixie calmly .
Parsing [sent. 2930 len. 13]: `` I 'm crossed in love myself , so I can understand .
Parsing [sent. 2931 len. 18]: It 's no use trying to sympathise till you 've had a taste of the trouble yourself .
Parsing [sent. 2932 len. 17]: Has it ever occurred to you to notice the mad ways most people set about sympathising ?
Parsing [sent. 2933 len. 13]: Sticking needles all over you while they 're trying to be kind .
Parsing [sent. 2934 len. 18]: Sympathising is an art , you know , and you have to adapt it to each person .
Parsing [sent. 2935 len. 43]: Some like a little and some like a lot , and some like cheering up , and others want you to cry with them and make the worst of everything , and then it 's off their minds and they perk up .
Parsing [sent. 2936 len. 30]: Bridgie and I used to think sometimes of hiring ourselves out as professional sympathisers , for there seems such a lack of people who can do it properly . ''
Parsing [sent. 2937 len. 9]: `` Suppose you give me a demonstration now !
Parsing [sent. 2938 len. 13]: You have n't been too generous in that respect , Pixie . ''
Parsing [sent. 2939 len. 18]: Pixie looked at him , her head on one side , her eyes very intent and serious .
Parsing [sent. 2940 len. 74]: `` You do n't _ need _ it , '' she said simply , and Stanor looked hurt and discomfited , and cast about in his mind for a convincing retort which should prove beyond doubt the pathos of his position , failed to find it , and acknowledged unwillingly to himself that as a matter of fact he _ was _ very well satisfied with the way in which things were going .
Parsing [sent. 2941 len. 28]: Pixie was right -- she usually _ was _ right ; it might , perhaps , be more agreeable if on occasions she could be judiciously blind !
Parsing [sent. 2942 len. 41]: He adopted the pained and dignified air which experience had taught him was the surest method of softening Pixie 's heart , and in less than a minute she was hanging on his arm and contradicting all her former statements .
Parsing [sent. 2943 len. 25]: Stanor was very much in love as he travelled back to town that day , and the two years of waiting seemed unbearably long .
Parsing [sent. 2944 len. 19]: Perhaps , if he got on unusually well , the Runkle might be induced to shorten the probation .
Parsing [sent. 2945 len. 12]: He would sound him at the end of the first year .
Parsing [sent. 2946 len. 37]: The next day Honor Ward made a farewell visit to the Hall , and took lunch with the family in the panelled dining-room , where she had joined in many merry gatherings a few weeks before .
Parsing [sent. 2947 len. 38]: Pixie saw the brown eyes flash a quick glance at the place which had been allotted to Robert Carr , but except for that glance there was no sign of anything unusual in either looks or manner .
Parsing [sent. 2948 len. 30]: Honor was as neat , as composed , as assured in manner as in her happiest moments , and the flow of her conversation was in no wise moderated .
Parsing [sent. 2949 len. 43]: Her hurried departure was explained by a casual `` I guessed I 'd better , '' which Mr and Mrs Hilliard accepted as sufficient reason for a girl who had no ties , and more money than she knew how to use .
Parsing [sent. 2950 len. 12]: Even Pixie 's lynx-eyes failed to descry any sign of heart-break .
Parsing [sent. 2951 len. 44]: But when the meal was over and the two girls retired upstairs for a private chat , Honor 's jaunty manners fell from her like a cloak , and she crouched in a corner of the sofa , looking suddenly tired and worn .
Parsing [sent. 2952 len. 19]: For the moment , however , it was not of her own affairs that she elected to speak .
Parsing [sent. 2953 len. 45]: `` Pat-ricia , '' she began suddenly , turning her honey-coloured eyes on her friend 's face with a penetrating gaze , `` I guess this is about the last real talk you and I are going to get for a good long spell .
Parsing [sent. 2954 len. 10]: There 's no time for fluttering round the point .
Parsing [sent. 2955 len. 15]: What I 've got in my mind I 'm going to _ say _ !
Parsing [sent. 2956 len. 13]: What in the land made you get engaged to Stanor Vaughan ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2957 len. 10]: `` Because he asked me , of course ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2958 len. 14]: replied Pixie readily , and the American girl gave a shrug of impatience .
Parsing [sent. 2959 len. 18]: `` If another man had asked you , then , it would have been just the same .
Parsing [sent. 2960 len. 12]: You would have accepted him for , the same reason ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2961 len. 13]: Pixie 's head reared proudly ; her eyes sent out a flash .
Parsing [sent. 2962 len. 14]: `` That 's horrid , and you _ meant _ it to be !
Parsing [sent. 2963 len. 15]: I sha n't answer your questions if you 're going to be rude . ''
Parsing [sent. 2964 len. 9]: `` I 'm not rude , Patricia O'Shaughnessy .
Parsing [sent. 2965 len. 38]: You 're a real sweet girl , and I want you should be as happy as you deserve , which you certainly wo n't be if you do n't take the trouble to understand your own heart .
Parsing [sent. 2966 len. 33]: What 's all this nonsense about being bound and not bound , and waiting for two years without writing , he on one side of the ocean , and you on another ?
Parsing [sent. 2967 len. 41]: I can understand an old uncle proposing it -- it 's just the sort of scheme an old uncle _ would _ propose -- but it wo n't work out , Patricia , you take my word for that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2968 len. 22]: `` Thank you , my dear , I prefer to take my own ; and he 's _ not _ old .
Parsing [sent. 2969 len. 10]: He has the most beautiful eyes you ever beheld .
Parsing [sent. 2970 len. 19]: What do you suppose Stanor would say if he knew you were talking to me like this ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2971 len. 10]: `` I 'm not saying a word against Stanor !
Parsing [sent. 2972 len. 11]: Who could say a word against such an elegant creature ?
Parsing [sent. 2973 len. 35]: He 's been a good friend to me , and he 's going to make a first-rate man when he gets to work , and has something to think about besides his beautiful self .
Parsing [sent. 2974 len. 9]: America 'll knock the nonsense out of him .
Parsing [sent. 2975 len. 38]: At the end of two years , it will be another man who comes home , a _ man _ instead of a boy , just as you will probably be a woman instead of a girl .
Parsing [sent. 2976 len. 29]: It 's the most critical time in life , when that change is taking place , and you 'd better believe I know what I 'm talking about .
Parsing [sent. 2977 len. 40]: If I were in your place I 'd move mountains , Patricia , if mountains had to be moved , but I 'd make sure that the man I loved did n't go through it apart from me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2978 len. 39]: `` But if the mountain happened to be an uncle , and the uncle had done everything , and was willing to go on doing everything , and was older and wiser , and knew better than you ?
Parsing [sent. 2979 len. 18]: Oh , dearie me , '' concluded Pixie impatiently , '' _ everybody _ seems against me !
Parsing [sent. 2980 len. 24]: I 'm lectured and thwarted on every side , I 've not been brought up to it , and it 's most depressing .
Parsing [sent. 2981 len. 25]: And it 's not a bit of good , either ; it 's my own life , and I shall do as I like .
Parsing [sent. 2982 len. 8]: And what about yourself , me dear ?
Parsing [sent. 2983 len. 8]: You are very brave about lecturing me .
Parsing [sent. 2984 len. 8]: Suppose _ I _ take a turn !
Parsing [sent. 2985 len. 13]: Why are you going back to America and leaving Robert Carr behind ?
Parsing [sent. 2986 len. 9]: What have you been doing to him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2987 len. 13]: `` I asked him to marry me , and he refused . ''
Parsing [sent. 2988 len. 8]: Pixie sat stunned with surprise and consternation .
Parsing [sent. 2989 len. 50]: Honor 's voice had been flat and level as usual , not a break or quiver had broken its flow , but there was a pallor round the lips , a sudden sharpening of the features , which spoke eloquently enough , and smote the hearer to the heart .
Parsing [sent. 2990 len. 10]: `` Oh , me dear , forgive me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2991 len. 4]: she cried deeply .
Parsing [sent. 2992 len. 5]: `` I 'm ashamed .
Parsing [sent. 2993 len. 6]: Do n't say any more .
Parsing [sent. 2994 len. 8]: I 'd no right to ask . ''
Parsing [sent. 2995 len. 7]: `` I meant to tell you .
Parsing [sent. 2996 len. 9]: I 'd have told you in any case .
Parsing [sent. 2997 len. 10]: You guessed how it was when we were here .
Parsing [sent. 2998 len. 15]: You ca n't be in love like that and _ not _ show it .
Parsing [sent. 2999 len. 45]: -- I thought of him all day ; I dreamt of him all night ... when he was out of the room I was wretched ; when he came in I knew it by instinct ; before I could see him I knew it !
Parsing [sent. 3000 len. 16]: In a crowded room I could hear every word he said , see every movement .
Parsing [sent. 3001 len. 25]: ... When I was sitting alone , and heard his voice in the distance , my heart leapt -- it made me quite faint .
Parsing [sent. 3002 len. 9]: I _ loved _ him , Pixie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3003 len. 7]: Pixie sat staring with startled gaze .
Parsing [sent. 3004 len. 45]: She did not speak , and for a moment it seemed that her thoughts had wandered from the story on hand , for her eyes had an _ inward _ look , as though she were puzzling out a problem which concerned herself alone .
Parsing [sent. 3005 len. 20]: She started slightly as Honor again began to speak , and straightened herself with a quick air of attention .
Parsing [sent. 3006 len. 25]: `` Sometimes I thought he loved me too , but he was not the sort of man who would choose to marry an heiress .
Parsing [sent. 3007 len. 6]: My money stood between us .
Parsing [sent. 3008 len. 17]: So I ... I tried to make it easier by showing him ... how I felt .
Parsing [sent. 3009 len. 44]: When we went back to London he said good-bye , and refused my invitations , but I met him by accident , and , '' she straightened herself with a gesture of pride , `` I am not ashamed of what I did .
Parsing [sent. 3010 len. 27]: It would have been folly to sacrifice happiness for the sake of a convention ... I _ asked _ him -- '' `` And ? '' ''
Parsing [sent. 3011 len. 6]: _ He cared _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3012 len. 4]: Honor said softly .
Parsing [sent. 3013 len. 32]: `` I had my hour , Pixie , but it was _ only _ an hour , for at the end we got to business , and that wrecked it all .
Parsing [sent. 3014 len. 8]: I 've told you about my factory .
Parsing [sent. 3015 len. 35]: Over here in England , when people have looked at me through monocles , there _ have _ been times when I 've been ashamed of pickles , but at home I 'm proud !
Parsing [sent. 3016 len. 18]: Father started as a working lad , and built up that great business , brick by brick .
Parsing [sent. 3017 len. 29]: Three thousand ` hands ' are employed in the factory , but they were never ` hands ' to him , Patricia , they were _ souls _ !
Parsing [sent. 3018 len. 24]: He 'd been a working man himself , and there was not one thing in their lives he did n't know and understand .
Parsing [sent. 3019 len. 46]: One of the first things I can remember , right away back in my childhood , is being taken to a window to see those men stream past , and being told they were my friends and that I was to take care of them .
Parsing [sent. 3020 len. 51]: He had no airs , my pappa ; he never gave himself frills , or pretended to be anything different from what he was -- there was only one thing he was proud of , and that was that his men were the happiest and most contented in the States .
Parsing [sent. 3021 len. 20]: When he died he left me more than his money , he left me his _ men _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3022 len. 27]: Honor paused , her eyes bright with suppressed feeling , and Pixie , keen as ever to appreciate an emotional situation , drew a fluttering breath .
Parsing [sent. 3023 len. 5]: `` Yes , yes !
Parsing [sent. 3024 len. 3]: How beautiful !
Parsing [sent. 3025 len. 3]: How fine !
Parsing [sent. 3026 len. 12]: All those lives ... Honor , are n't you proud ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3027 len. 10]: `` I 've told you before , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 3028 len. 35]: The best part of me is proud and glad , but we 're pretty complex creatures , and I guess a big duty is bound to come up against a pleasure now and then .
Parsing [sent. 3029 len. 26]: At the moment I was speaking of , it was one man against three thousand , and the one man weighed down the scale . ''
Parsing [sent. 3030 len. 10]: `` But ... but I do n't understand . ''
Parsing [sent. 3031 len. 7]: Pixie puckered her brows in bewilderment .
Parsing [sent. 3032 len. 9]: `` Why could n't you have both ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3033 len. 8]: `` I thought I could , Patricia .
Parsing [sent. 3034 len. 26]: I calculated , as my work was full-fledged , and his had hardly begun , that he would be willing to come over with me .
Parsing [sent. 3035 len. 26]: It 's a pretty stiff proposition for a woman to run a big show like that , and I 'd have been glad of help .
Parsing [sent. 3036 len. 32]: _ He _ allowed I 'd have to sell up and keep house for him in England , and make a splash among the big-wigs to help him in his career .
Parsing [sent. 3037 len. 58]: He put it as politely as he knew how , but he made me understand that it was beneath his dignity to live in America and work in pickles , and he guessed if I sold out I could find a buyer who would look after the men as well as or better than I did myself .
Parsing [sent. 3038 len. 15]: So -- '' she waved her small white hands -- `` there we were !
Parsing [sent. 3039 len. 9]: He would n't , and I could n't !
Parsing [sent. 3040 len. 7]: That 's the truth , Patricia .
Parsing [sent. 3041 len. 6]: I could _ not _ !
Parsing [sent. 3042 len. 21]: I do n't dispute that another person might not manage as well as I , that 's not the question .
Parsing [sent. 3043 len. 25]: It 's my work , it 's my responsibility ; those men were left to _ me _ , and I ca n't desert .
Parsing [sent. 3044 len. 20]: So the dream 's over , my dear , and I 'm going back to real hard life . ''
Parsing [sent. 3045 len. 11]: Pixie nodded , the big tears standing in her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3046 len. 8]: `` I should have done the same .
Parsing [sent. 3047 len. 10]: He did n't love you _ enough _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 3048 len. 6]: Honor gave a quivering laugh .
Parsing [sent. 3049 len. 8]: `` He said the same of me .
Parsing [sent. 3050 len. 24]: Could n't seem to see any difference between the two ` give-ups ' ; but there _ is _ a difference , Patricia .
Parsing [sent. 3051 len. 12]: Well , my dear , that 's the end of it .
Parsing [sent. 3052 len. 15]: We said good-bye , and there 's no reason why we should meet again .
Parsing [sent. 3053 len. 19]: ... Our lives lie in different places , and it 's no use trying to join them . ''
Parsing [sent. 3054 len. 11]: `` Honor , dear , are you very unhappy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3055 len. 10]: Honor 's neat little features puckered in a grimace .
Parsing [sent. 3056 len. 25]: `` I would n't go so far as to say I feel exactly gay , Patricia , but do n't you worry about me .
Parsing [sent. 3057 len. 6]: I 'll come up smiling .
Parsing [sent. 3058 len. 23]: You would n't have me pine for the sake of a man who would n't have me when he got the chance ?
Parsing [sent. 3059 len. 13]: I guess Honor P Ward has too much grit for that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3060 len. 4]: Pixie nodded slowly .
Parsing [sent. 3061 len. 39]: `` But you must n't be too hard on him , Honor -- It 's natural to want to live in one 's own country , and he loves _ his _ work just as you do yours .
Parsing [sent. 3062 len. 26]: He 'll be a judge some day -- chins like that always _ do _ succeed -- and ambition means so much to a man .
Parsing [sent. 3063 len. 39]: You might have been pleased for your own sake ; but would you have thought more of _ him _ as a _ man _ if he 'd thrown it all up and lived on your pickles ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3064 len. 9]: Honor brought her eyebrows together in a frown .
Parsing [sent. 3065 len. 14]: `` Now , Pixie O'Shaughnessy , do n't you go taking his part !
Parsing [sent. 3066 len. 58]: I guess I 've got about as much sense of justice as most , and in a few months ' time I 'll see the matter in its right light , but for the moment I 'm injured , and I _ choose _ to feel injured ; and I expect my friends to feel injured too .
Parsing [sent. 3067 len. 16]: I 've offered myself to an Englishman , and he 's refused to have me .
Parsing [sent. 3068 len. 22]: There 's no getting ; away from that fact , and it 's not a soothing experience for a free-born American .
Parsing [sent. 3069 len. 11]: I 'm through with Englishmen from this time forth ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3070 len. 4]: `` Except Stanor !
Parsing [sent. 3071 len. 5]: Be kind to Stanor .
Parsing [sent. 3072 len. 16]: He 's always liked you , Honor , and he knows no one in America .
Parsing [sent. 3073 len. 18]: Promise me to be kind to Stanor , and see him as often as you can ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3074 len. 13]: Honor 's brown eyes searched Pixie 's face with a curious glance .
Parsing [sent. 3075 len. 19]: Then , rising from her chair , she crossed the room and kissed her warmly upon the cheek .
Parsing [sent. 3076 len. 9]: `` Yes , I 'll look after him .
Parsing [sent. 3077 len. 16]: I 'll do anything you want , and nothing you _ do n't _ want .
Parsing [sent. 3078 len. 8]: You can trust me , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 3079 len. 7]: Remember that , wo n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 3080 len. 10]: You 're a real sweet thing , Patricia ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3081 len. 6]: Pixie laughed with characteristic complacence .
Parsing [sent. 3082 len. 10]: `` Yes ; but why especially at this moment ?
Parsing [sent. 3083 len. 10]: I always _ am _ , are n't I ?
Parsing [sent. 3084 len. 12]: And how superfluous , me dear , to talk of trust ?
Parsing [sent. 3085 len. 8]: What have I got to trust ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3086 len. 25]: ------------------------------------------------------------------------ A fortnight later Geoffrey and Joan Hilliard , Stephen Glynn , and Pixie journeyed to Liverpool to see the last of the travellers .
Parsing [sent. 3087 len. 36]: The little party stood together on the deck of the great vessel , surrounded on every side by surge and bustle , but silent themselves with the silence which falls when the heart is full .
Parsing [sent. 3088 len. 32]: Travelling down to Liverpool they had been quite a merry party , and there had been no effort in keeping the conversation afloat ; but the last moments sealed their lips .
Parsing [sent. 3089 len. 30]: Honor drew a few yards apart with the elderly , kindly-faced maid who was her faithful attendant ; Stephen Glynn and the Hilliards strolled away in an opposite direction .
Parsing [sent. 3090 len. 7]: Pixie and her lover stood alone .
Parsing [sent. 3091 len. 10]: `` Well , little girl ... this is good-bye !
Parsing [sent. 3092 len. 11]: Do n't forget me , darling ... '' Pixie gulped .
Parsing [sent. 3093 len. 8]: `` Take care of yourself , Stanor .
Parsing [sent. 3094 len. 3]: Be happy !
Parsing [sent. 3095 len. 9]: ... I want you to be happy . ''
Parsing [sent. 3096 len. 7]: `` I shall be wretched ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3097 len. 4]: said Stanor hotly .
Parsing [sent. 3098 len. 6]: `` I 'm leaving you .
Parsing [sent. 3099 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 3100 len. 31]: Pixie -- '' He broke off suddenly as the last bell sounded its warning note , and bent to kiss her lips ; `` Good-bye , my little love ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3101 len. 47]: The tears poured down Pixie 's face as she turned aside , and Geoffrey Hilliard led her tenderly down the gangway on to the landing-stage , where they stood together , tightly jammed in the crowd which watched the great steamer slowly move into the stream .
Parsing [sent. 3102 len. 36]: Stanor and Honor were standing together leaning over the towering hull ; their faces were pale , but they were smiling bravely , and Pixie wiped away her own tears and waved an answering hand .
Parsing [sent. 3103 len. 28]: Esmeralda was holding her hand in a tender pressure ; Geoffrey on one side , and Stephen Glynn on the other were regarding her with anxious solicitude .
Parsing [sent. 3104 len. 12]: She smiled back with tremulous gratitude and gripped Esmeralda 's hand .
Parsing [sent. 3105 len. 20]: Though Stanor was going , there was still much left , so many people to care and be kind .
Parsing [sent. 3106 len. 9]: The great vessel quivered and moved slowly forward .
Parsing [sent. 3107 len. 35]: Honor drew a little white handkerchief from her bag and waved it in the air ; on all sides the action was repeated , accompanied by cries of farewell mingled with sounds of distress .
Parsing [sent. 3108 len. 33]: Pixie caught the sound of a sob , and craned forward to look in the face of a girl about her own age who stood on the other side of Stephen Glynn .
Parsing [sent. 3109 len. 36]: She wore a small , close-fitting cap , which left her face fully exposed as it strained towards that moving deck , and on the small white features was printed a very extremity of anguish .
Parsing [sent. 3110 len. 49]: She was not crying ; her glazed eyes showed no trace of tears , she seemed unconscious of the deep sobs which issued from her lips ; every nerve , every power was concentrated in the one effort to behold to the last possible moment one beloved face .
Parsing [sent. 3111 len. 29]: Instinctively Pixie 's eyes followed those of the girl 's , and beheld a man 's face gazing back , haggard , a-quiver , almost contorted with suffering .
Parsing [sent. 3112 len. 7]: The story was plain to read .
Parsing [sent. 3113 len. 11]: They also were lovers -- this man and this girl .
Parsing [sent. 3114 len. 21]: They also were facing years of separation , and the moment of parting held for them the bitterness of death .
Parsing [sent. 3115 len. 44]: Pixie O'Shaughnessy glanced from one to the other , and then thoughtfully , deliberately along the deck to the spot where stood her own lover , handsome Stanor , bending his head to overhear a remark from Honor , stroking his blonde moustache .
Parsing [sent. 3116 len. 27]: He looked dejected , depressed ; but compared with the depth of emotion on the other man 's face , such meagre expressions faded into nothingness .
Parsing [sent. 3117 len. 103]: The moment during which she gazed at his face held for Pixie the significance of years ; then once more her eyes returned to the girl by her side ... With every minute now the great vessel was slipping farther and farther from the stage ; the faces of her passengers would soon cease to be distinguishable ; in a few minutes they would be lost to sight , yet Pixie 's gaze remained riveted on the girl by her side , and on her own face was printed a mute dismay which one onlooker at least was quick to read . ''
Parsing [sent. 3118 len. 6]: _ She understands _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3119 len. 6]: Stephen Glynn said to himself .
Parsing [sent. 3120 len. 15]: `` That girl 's face has been an object lesson stronger than any words .
Parsing [sent. 3121 len. 6]: She understands the difference . ''
Parsing [sent. 3122 len. 34]: A moment later he met Pixie 's eyes , and realised afresh the truth of his diagnosis ; but she drew herself up with a sort of defiance , and turned sharply aside .
Parsing [sent. 3123 len. 24]: ------------------------------------------------------------------------ In the train returning to town Pixie sat mute and pallid , and was waited upon assiduously by her sister and brother .
Parsing [sent. 3124 len. 18]: To them it seemed natural enough that the poor child should collapse after the strain of parting .
Parsing [sent. 3125 len. 11]: Only one person understood the deepest reason of her distress .
Parsing [sent. 3126 len. 22]: He offered none of the conventional words of sympathy , and forebore to echo Esmeralda 's rosy pictures of the future .
Parsing [sent. 3127 len. 17]: It brought another pang to Pixie 's sore heart to realise that he _ understood _ .
Parsing [sent. 3128 len. 22]: `` But I will be true , '' she repeated to herself with insistent energy ; `` I will be true .
Parsing [sent. 3129 len. 7]: I have given my word . ''
Parsing [sent. 3130 len. 18]: She felt very tired and spent as she lay back in the corner of her cushioned seat .
Parsing [sent. 3131 len. 25]: On heart and brain was an unaccustomed weight ; her very limbs felt heavy and inert , as if the motive power had failed .
Parsing [sent. 3132 len. 7]: Virtue had gone out of her .
Parsing [sent. 3133 len. 21]: At the sight of that anguished face , the years of Pixie 's untroubled girlhood had come to an end .
Parsing [sent. 3134 len. 11]: Henceforth she was a woman , carrying her own burden .
Parsing [sent. 3135 len. 19]: `` But I will be true , '' she repeated gallantly ; `` I will be true ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3136 len. 3]: CHAPTER NINETEEN .
Parsing [sent. 3137 len. 4]: PIXIE SEEKS ADVICE .
Parsing [sent. 3138 len. 27]: A tall young man lay stretched upon a narrow bed which filled an entire wall of the one and only sitting-room in a diminutive London flat .
Parsing [sent. 3139 len. 23]: On the wall opposite was a fireplace and a small sideboard ; against the third wall stood a couple of upright chairs .
Parsing [sent. 3140 len. 10]: In the centre of the room stood a table .
Parsing [sent. 3141 len. 36]: A wicker arm-chair did duty for an invalid tray , and held a selection of pipes , books , and writing materials , also a bottle of medicine , and a plate of unappetising biscuits .
Parsing [sent. 3142 len. 33]: The young man took up one of the biscuits , nibbled a crumb from the edge , and aimed the remainder violently at a picture at the other end of the room .
Parsing [sent. 3143 len. 27]: It hit , and the biscuit broke into pieces , but the glass remained intact , a result which seemed far from satisfactory to the onlooker .
Parsing [sent. 3144 len. 51]: He fumbled impatiently for matches with which to light his pipe , touched the box with the tips of his outstretched fingers , and jerked it impatiently , whereupon it rolled on to the floor to a spot just a couple of inches beyond the utmost stretch of his arm .
Parsing [sent. 3145 len. 14]: There it lay -- obvious and aggravating , tempting , baffling , inaccessible .
Parsing [sent. 3146 len. 42]: Pipe and tobacco lay at hand to supply the soothing which he so sorely needed at the end of a lonely , suffering day , and for the want of that box they might as well have been a mile away !
Parsing [sent. 3147 len. 20]: A bell was within reach , but what use to ring that when no one was near to hear ?
Parsing [sent. 3148 len. 38]: The slovenly woman who called herself a working housekeeper found it necessary to sally forth each afternoon on long shopping expeditions , and during her absence her master had to fend for himself as best he might .
Parsing [sent. 3149 len. 45]: Dislocation of the knee was the young man 's malady , just a sharp , swift rush at cricket , a slip on the dry grass , and Pat O'Shaughnessy shuddered every time he thought of the hours and days which followed that fall .
Parsing [sent. 3150 len. 25]: He had asked to be taken home , for the tiny flat was a new possession , and as such dear to his heart .
Parsing [sent. 3151 len. 22]: And to his home they carried him , and there he had lain already for longer than he cared to think .
Parsing [sent. 3152 len. 56]: He had progressed to the point when he had been able to dismiss an excellent but uncongenial nurse , and manage with an hour 's assistance morning and night ; and what with reading the newspapers , smoking his pipe , and writing an occasional letter the first part of the day passed quickly enough .
Parsing [sent. 3153 len. 17]: Lunch was served at one o'clock on a papier-mache tray spread with a crumpled tray cloth .
Parsing [sent. 3154 len. 52]: It was a tepid , tasteless , unappetising meal , for the working housekeeper knew neither how to work nor to cook , and Pat invariably sent it away almost untasted ; yet every day he looked forward afresh to the advent of one o'clock and the appearance of the tray .
Parsing [sent. 3155 len. 24]: It was something to happen , something to do , a change from the reading , of which he was already getting tired .
Parsing [sent. 3156 len. 70]: But , after lunch , after he had wakened from the short siesta ; and realised that it was not yet three o'clock , and that six , seven hours still remained to be lived through before he could reasonably hope to settle for the night -- that was a dreary time indeed , and Pat , whose interests lay all outdoors , knew no means of lightening it .
Parsing [sent. 3157 len. 15]: For the first week of his confinement Pat had had a string of visitors .
Parsing [sent. 3158 len. 72]: The members of his cricket team had appeared to express sympathy and encouragement ; some of the men against whom he had been playing had also put in an appearance ; `` fellows '' had come up from `` the office , '' but in the busy life of London a man who goes _ on _ being ill is apt to find himself left alone before many weeks have passed .
Parsing [sent. 3159 len. 37]: There was only one man who never failed to put in an appearance at some hour of the day , and on that man 's coming Pat O'Shaughnessy this afternoon concentrated every power in his possession .
Parsing [sent. 3160 len. 18]: `` They say if you wish hard enough you can make a fellow do what you like .
Parsing [sent. 3161 len. 16]: If there 's any truth in it , Glynn ought to come along pretty soon .
Parsing [sent. 3162 len. 16]: How am I going to lie here all afternoon and stare at those miserable matches ?
Parsing [sent. 3163 len. 20]: That wretched woman might be buying the town ... wish to goodness she 'd fetch something fit to eat .
Parsing [sent. 3164 len. 34]: If that doctor fellow wo n't tell me to-morrow how much longer I have to lie here , I 'll -- I 'll get up and walk , just to spite him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3165 len. 11]: Pat jerked defiantly and immediately gave a groan of pain .
Parsing [sent. 3166 len. 8]: Not much chance of walking yet awhile !
Parsing [sent. 3167 len. 28]: He wriggled to the edge of the sofa , and made another unsuccessful stretch for the matchbox , but those baffling two inches refused to be mastered .
Parsing [sent. 3168 len. 63]: Pat looked around in a desperate search for help , seized a biscuit , and aimed it carefully for the farther edge of the box , which , hit at the right angle , might perhaps have been twitched nearer to the sofa , but though Pat had considerable skill in the art of throwing , he had no luck this afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 3169 len. 40]: Biscuit after biscuit was hurled with increasing violence , as temper suffered from the strain of failure , and each time the matchbox jumped still farther _ away _ , while another shower of biscuit crumbs bespattered the carpet .
Parsing [sent. 3170 len. 35]: Then at last when the plate was emptied , and the last hope gone , deliverance came at the sound of the opening of the front door , and a quick , well-known whistle .
Parsing [sent. 3171 len. 2]: Glynn !
Parsing [sent. 3172 len. 11]: No one else knew the secret of the hidden key .
Parsing [sent. 3173 len. 25]: Pat halloed loudly in response , and the next moment Stephen stood in the doorway , looking with bewildered eyes at the bespattered carpet .
Parsing [sent. 3174 len. 5]: `` What 's this ?
Parsing [sent. 3175 len. 4]: Playing Aunt Sally ?
Parsing [sent. 3176 len. 12]: Rather a wanton waste of biscuits , is n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3177 len. 7]: `` Try 'em , and see !
Parsing [sent. 3178 len. 4]: Soft as dough .
Parsing [sent. 3179 len. 12]: Give me that matchbox , Glynn , like a good soul .
Parsing [sent. 3180 len. 30]: It fell off my chair , and I 've been lying here pining for a smoke , and making pot shots of it , till I felt half mad .
Parsing [sent. 3181 len. 14]: -- If you only knew -- '' Stephen Glynn _ did _ know .
Parsing [sent. 3182 len. 23]: It was that knowledge which brought him regularly day by day to the little flat at the top of eighty odd stairs .
Parsing [sent. 3183 len. 33]: He walked across the room , his limp decidedly less in evidence through the passage of the years , reclaimed the matchbox , and seated himself on the edge of the couch .
Parsing [sent. 3184 len. 7]: `` Light up , old fellow !
Parsing [sent. 3185 len. 7]: It will do you good . ''
Parsing [sent. 3186 len. 8]: Pat struck the match and sucked luxuriously .
Parsing [sent. 3187 len. 10]: There was no need to make conversation to Glynn .
Parsing [sent. 3188 len. 9]: He was a comfortable fellow who always understood .
Parsing [sent. 3189 len. 34]: It was good to see him sitting there , to look at his fine , grave face , and realise that boredom was over , and the happiest hour of the day begun .
Parsing [sent. 3190 len. 14]: `` I say , Glynn , I _ made _ you , come !
Parsing [sent. 3191 len. 3]: Mesmerised you .
Parsing [sent. 3192 len. 14]: It drives a fellow crazy to be done by a couple of inches .
Parsing [sent. 3193 len. 20]: They say if you concentrate your thoughts -- '' `` I arranged this morning to call at five o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 3194 len. 14]: I should say by the look of things you had concentrated on biscuits .
Parsing [sent. 3195 len. 8]: ... Where 's that old woman ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3196 len. 3]: Glynn inquired .
Parsing [sent. 3197 len. 3]: `` Shopping .
Parsing [sent. 3198 len. 3]: Always is .
Parsing [sent. 3199 len. 11]: And never buys anything by the taste of the food .
Parsing [sent. 3200 len. 7]: You should have seen my lunch !
Parsing [sent. 3201 len. 11]: I 'll be a living skeleton at this rate . ''
Parsing [sent. 3202 len. 28]: Pat spoke laughingly , but the hearer frowned , and looked quickly at the sharpened face , on which weeks of solitary confinement had left their mark .
Parsing [sent. 3203 len. 10]: `` Why do n't you round into her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3204 len. 4]: `` Dare n't !
Parsing [sent. 3205 len. 10]: Might make off and leave me in the lurch .
Parsing [sent. 3206 len. 6]: They do , you know .
Parsing [sent. 3207 len. 5]: Fellows have told me .
Parsing [sent. 3208 len. 17]: Any one is better than no one at all when you are minus a leg . ''
Parsing [sent. 3209 len. 6]: `` And about that letter ?
Parsing [sent. 3210 len. 7]: The time limit runs out to-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 3211 len. 7]: You know what I threatened ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3212 len. 4]: Pat shrugged impatiently .
Parsing [sent. 3213 len. 6]: `` You and your threats !
Parsing [sent. 3214 len. 23]: What 's the sense in worrying when it 's got to _ end _ in worrying , and can do no good ?
Parsing [sent. 3215 len. 36]: I 've told you till I 'm tired -- the Hilliards are abroad , Dick Victor is down with rheumatism , and Bridgie makes sure he 's going to die every time his finger aches .
Parsing [sent. 3216 len. 23]: She 'd leave him if I died first , I suppose , but I would n't make too sure even of that .
Parsing [sent. 3217 len. 17]: ` Twould have finished her altogether to know that I was lying here all these weeks .
Parsing [sent. 3218 len. 3]: However ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3219 len. 16]: Pat shrugged again , `` you 've got your way , bad luck to you !
Parsing [sent. 3220 len. 27]: Bridgie wrote to ask me to run down over a Sunday , to cheer Victor , so there was nothing for it but to own up .
Parsing [sent. 3221 len. 11]: She 'll write me reams of advice and send embrocations .
Parsing [sent. 3222 len. 16]: Serve you jolly well right if I rubbed them on _ you _ instead ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3223 len. 9]: `` Fire away , I do n't mind !
Parsing [sent. 3224 len. 12]: Your muscles would be the better for a little exercise . ''
Parsing [sent. 3225 len. 18]: Stephen Glynn leaned back in his chair and looked affectionately at Pat 's dark , handsome face .
Parsing [sent. 3226 len. 28]: Twelve months before the two men had been introduced at a dinner following a big cricket match in which Pat had distinguished himself by a fine innings .
Parsing [sent. 3227 len. 52]: Stephen Glynn from his seat on the grand stand had applauded with the rest of the great audience , and looking at the printed card in his hand had wondered whether by chance P.D. O'Shaughnessy was any relation of the Irish Pixie to whom Stanor Vaughan had wished to be engaged .
Parsing [sent. 3228 len. 30]: The wonder changed to certainty a few hours later on as he was introduced to the young player , and met the gaze of his straight , dark eyes !
Parsing [sent. 3229 len. 61]: Pat was the handsomest of the three brothers , nevertheless it was not so much of beautiful Joan Hilliard that the beholder was reminded , at this moment , as of the younger sister , who had no beauty at all , for Esmeralda 's perfect features lacked the irradiation of kindliness and humour which characterised Pat and Pixie alike .
Parsing [sent. 3230 len. 37]: Stephen Glynn was not given to sudden fancies , but Pat O'Shaughnessy walked straight into his heart at that first meeting , and during the year which followed the acquaintance so begun had ripened into intimacy .
Parsing [sent. 3231 len. 63]: Stephen spent a great part of his time in chambers in town , where the young man became a welcome guest , and no sooner had Pat soared to the giddy height of possessing a flat of his own , and settled down as a householder , than the accident had happened which made him dependent on the visits of his friends .
Parsing [sent. 3232 len. 35]: Pat was aware of Stephen 's connection with his family , and more especially with Pixie , but after one brief reference the subject had been buried , though Pixie herself was frequently mentioned .
Parsing [sent. 3233 len. 24]: There was a portrait of her on Pat 's mantelpiece to which Stephen 's eyes often strayed during his visits to the flat .
Parsing [sent. 3234 len. 10]: Truth to tell it was not a flattering portrait .
Parsing [sent. 3235 len. 22]: Pixie was unfortunate so far as photography was concerned , since all her bad points were reproduced and her charm disappeared .
Parsing [sent. 3236 len. 26]: Stephen wondered if Stanor were gazing at the same photograph in New York , and if his imagination were strong enough to supply the want .
Parsing [sent. 3237 len. 7]: For himself he had no difficulty .
Parsing [sent. 3238 len. 52]: So vivid was his recollection that even as he looked the set face of the photograph seemed to flash into smiles ... `` Well , I am glad you have given in , '' he said , continuing his sentence after a leisurely pause , `` because my threat was real .
Parsing [sent. 3239 len. 16]: I should certainly have written to your people if you had n't done it yourself .
Parsing [sent. 3240 len. 11]: You are not being properly looked after , young man .
Parsing [sent. 3241 len. 13]: To put it bluntly , you are not having enough to eat .
Parsing [sent. 3242 len. 17]: When do you expect that obnoxious old female to come back and make tea ? '' ''
Parsing [sent. 3243 len. 14]: ` Deed , I 've given over expecting , '' said Pat despondently .
Parsing [sent. 3244 len. 18]: `` Most days I 'm ready to drink the teapot by the time she brings it in .
Parsing [sent. 3245 len. 21]: It 's a toss up if we _ get _ it at all to-day as she 's gone out . ''
Parsing [sent. 3246 len. 15]: Stephen rose to his tall height and stood smiling down at the tired face .
Parsing [sent. 3247 len. 9]: `` You shall have it , my boy .
Parsing [sent. 3248 len. 6]: I 'll make it myself .
Parsing [sent. 3249 len. 8]: It wo n't be the first time .
Parsing [sent. 3250 len. 9]: Have you any idea where the crocks live ?
Parsing [sent. 3251 len. 32]: I do n't want to upset -- '' Before he could complete his sentence , a thunderous knocking sounded at the front door , causing both hearers to start with astonishment .
Parsing [sent. 3252 len. 32]: So loud , so vigorous , so long continued was the assault , that the first surprise deepened into indignation , and Pat 's dark eyes sent out a threatening flash .
Parsing [sent. 3253 len. 8]: `` This is _ too _ strong !
Parsing [sent. 3254 len. 20]: Lost her key , I suppose , and expects me to crawl on all fours to let her in .
Parsing [sent. 3255 len. 13]: You go , Glynn , and send her straight here to me !
Parsing [sent. 3256 len. 10]: I 'll give her a bit of my mind .
Parsing [sent. 3257 len. 10]: I 'm just in the mood to do it .
Parsing [sent. 3258 len. 14]: Leaving me alone for hours and then knocking down my door -- ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3259 len. 36]: Stephen Glynn crossed the floor , his face set into an alarming sternness , for his irritation against his friend 's neglectful domestic had been growing for weeks , and this was the culminating point .
Parsing [sent. 3260 len. 30]: He seized the handle , turned it quietly , and jerked the door open with a disconcerting suddenness which had the effect of precipitating the new-comer into his arms .
Parsing [sent. 3261 len. 7]: `` Me _ dear _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3262 len. 26]: she cried rapturously , as she fell , but the same moment she was upright again , bolt upright , scorching him with disdainful glance .
Parsing [sent. 3263 len. 5]: `` It 's not !
Parsing [sent. 3264 len. 5]: -- Where am I ?
Parsing [sent. 3265 len. 13]: ... They _ said _ it was Mr O'Shaughnessy 's flat ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3266 len. 4]: `` It is !
Parsing [sent. 3267 len. 3]: It is !
Parsing [sent. 3268 len. 2]: Pixie !
Parsing [sent. 3269 len. 2]: Pixie !
Parsing [sent. 3270 len. 6]: Come in , come quick !
Parsing [sent. 3271 len. 14]: Oh , you blessed little simpleton , what 's the meaning of this ?
Parsing [sent. 3272 len. 7]: You 'd no business to come .
Parsing [sent. 3273 len. 7]: There 's no room for you .
Parsing [sent. 3274 len. 6]: I 'm nearly well now .
Parsing [sent. 3275 len. 16]: There 's no need -- I -- I -- oh , _ Pixie _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3276 len. 24]: and poor , tired , hungry Pat lay back weakly in his sister 's arms , and came perilously near subsiding into tears .
Parsing [sent. 3277 len. 53]: It had been hard work keeping up his pecker all these long weeks , it was so overwhelmingly home-like to see Pixie 's face , and listen to her deep mellow tones ... `` There 's _ got _ to be room , me dear , for I 've come to stay .
Parsing [sent. 3278 len. 8]: How dare you be ill by yourself ?
Parsing [sent. 3279 len. 18]: It 's a bad effect London has had on you to make you so close and secretive .
Parsing [sent. 3280 len. 2]: You !
Parsing [sent. 3281 len. 14]: Who yelled the roof down if you as much as scratched your finger !
Parsing [sent. 3282 len. 15]: We got the note this morning -- '' `` Glynn made me send it .
Parsing [sent. 3283 len. 9]: He 's been worrying at me for weeks .
Parsing [sent. 3284 len. 3]: Glynn ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3285 len. 8]: Pat raised his voice to a cry .
Parsing [sent. 3286 len. 5]: `` Where are you ?
Parsing [sent. 3287 len. 6]: Come in , you beggar .
Parsing [sent. 3288 len. 4]: It 's Pixie !
Parsing [sent. 3289 len. 4]: My sister Pixie .
Parsing [sent. 3290 len. 6]: Come and shake hands . ''
Parsing [sent. 3291 len. 18]: Stephen and Pixie advanced to meet each other , red in the face and bashful of eye .
Parsing [sent. 3292 len. 39]: The encounter at the door had been so momentary that she had hardly had time to recognise the pale face with the deep blue eyes , but for him the first note of her voice had been sufficient .
Parsing [sent. 3293 len. 10]: `` I -- I thought you were Pat ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3294 len. 11]: `` I -- I thought you were the cook . ''
Parsing [sent. 3295 len. 13]: She straightened at that , with a flash of half-resentful curiosity . ''
Parsing [sent. 3296 len. 4]: _ Why _ ?
Parsing [sent. 3297 len. 6]: Am I so like her ?
Parsing [sent. 3298 len. 13]: And do you always -- '' `` No , I do n't .
Parsing [sent. 3299 len. 2]: Never .
Parsing [sent. 3300 len. 21]: But to-day she was out and your brother wanted -- '' `` Oh , never mind , never mind ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3301 len. 12]: Pat was too greedy for attention to suffer a long explanation .
Parsing [sent. 3302 len. 6]: `` What does it matter ?
Parsing [sent. 3303 len. 17]: She 's a wretch , Pixie , and she goes out and leaves me to starve .
Parsing [sent. 3304 len. 15]: That good Samaritan was going to make tea when we heard your knock . ''
Parsing [sent. 3305 len. 9]: `` I 'll make it for you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3306 len. 41]: Pixie said smiling , but she seated herself by Pat 's side as she spoke , and slid her hand through his arm , as though realising that for the moment her presence was the most welcome of all refreshments .
Parsing [sent. 3307 len. 32]: She wore a smartly cut tweed coat and skirt , and a soft felt hat with a pheasant 's wing , and her brown shoes looked quite preposterously small and bright .
Parsing [sent. 3308 len. 30]: In some indefinable way she looked older and more responsible than the Pixie of two years before , and Stephen noticed the change and wondered as to its cause .
Parsing [sent. 3309 len. 33]: `` I think I will go now , '' he said hastily ; `` your sister will look after you , O'Shaughnessy , and you will have so much to talk about .
Parsing [sent. 3310 len. 6]: I 'll come again ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3311 len. 29]: But Pat was obstinate ; he insisted that his friend should stay on , and appealed to Pixie for support , which she gave with great good will .
Parsing [sent. 3312 len. 4]: `` Please do !
Parsing [sent. 3313 len. 10]: We 'll talk the better for having an audience .
Parsing [sent. 3314 len. 7]: Wo n't we now , Pat ?
Parsing [sent. 3315 len. 6]: We were always vain . ''
Parsing [sent. 3316 len. 5]: `` We were ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3317 len. 5]: Pat assented with unction .
Parsing [sent. 3318 len. 4]: `` Especially yourself .
Parsing [sent. 3319 len. 12]: Even as a child you played up to the gallery . ''
Parsing [sent. 3320 len. 12]: He took her hand and squeezed it tightly between his own .
Parsing [sent. 3321 len. 9]: `` Pixie , I ca n't believe it !
Parsing [sent. 3322 len. 8]: It 's too nice to be true .
Parsing [sent. 3323 len. 8]: And Bridgie , what does she say ?
Parsing [sent. 3324 len. 8]: Does she approve of your coming ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3325 len. 13]: `` She did one moment , and the next she did n't .
Parsing [sent. 3326 len. 27]: She was torn in pieces , the poor darling , wanting to come to you herself , and to stay with Dick at the same time .
Parsing [sent. 3327 len. 10]: You know what she is when Dick is ill !
Parsing [sent. 3328 len. 30]: His temperature has only to go up one point , to have her weeping about Homes for Soldiers ' Orphans , and pondering how she can get most votes .
Parsing [sent. 3329 len. 17]: He 's buried with military honours , poor Richard , every time he takes a cold .
Parsing [sent. 3330 len. 16]: So I was firm with her , and just packed my things and came off .
Parsing [sent. 3331 len. 16]: At my age , '' she straightened herself proudly , `` one must assert oneself !
Parsing [sent. 3332 len. 38]: I asked her what was the use of being twenty-two , and how she 'd have liked it herself if she 'd been thwarted at that age , and she gave in and packed up remedies . ''
Parsing [sent. 3333 len. 31]: Pixie picked up the brown leather bag which lay on the floor , and opening it , took out the contents in turns , and laid them on the sofa .
Parsing [sent. 3334 len. 9]: `` A tonic to build up the system .
Parsing [sent. 3335 len. 5]: Beef-juice , to ditto .
Parsing [sent. 3336 len. 9]: Embrocation to be applied to the injured part .
Parsing [sent. 3337 len. 3]: ... Tabloids .
Parsing [sent. 3338 len. 3]: Home-made cake .
Parsing [sent. 3339 len. 6]: ... Oh , that tea !
Parsing [sent. 3340 len. 4]: I 'd forgotten .
Parsing [sent. 3341 len. 16]: I 'll make it at once , and we 'll eat the cake now . ''
Parsing [sent. 3342 len. 9]: She jumped up and looked appealingly towards Stephen .
Parsing [sent. 3343 len. 8]: `` Will you show me the kitchen ?
Parsing [sent. 3344 len. 12]: I do n't know my way through these lordly fastnesses ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3345 len. 22]: They went out of the room together , while Pat called out an eager , `` Do n't be long ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3346 len. 10]: It was only a step into the tiny kitchen .
Parsing [sent. 3347 len. 23]: In another moment Stephen and Pixie stood within its portals , and she had closed the door behind with a careful hand .
Parsing [sent. 3348 len. 15]: Her face had sobered , and there was an anxious furrow in her forehead .
Parsing [sent. 3349 len. 8]: `` He looks _ ill _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3350 len. 4]: she said breathlessly .
Parsing [sent. 3351 len. 6]: `` Worse than I expected .
Parsing [sent. 3352 len. 7]: He said he was getting well .
Parsing [sent. 3353 len. 12]: Please tell me honestly -- Is it _ true _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3354 len. 7]: `` Perfectly true in one sense .
Parsing [sent. 3355 len. 13]: The knee is doing well , but his general health has suffered .
Parsing [sent. 3356 len. 16]: He has been lonely and underfed , and at the first there was considerable pain .
Parsing [sent. 3357 len. 22]: I did my best to make him write to you before , for he is not fit to be left alone .
Parsing [sent. 3358 len. 8]: That servant is lazy and inefficient . ''
Parsing [sent. 3359 len. 13]: Pixie glanced round the untidy room with her nose tilted high . ''
Parsing [sent. 3360 len. 18]: ` Twill be a healthful shock for her to come back and find a mistress in possession .
Parsing [sent. 3361 len. 29]: We 'll have a heart to heart talk to-morrow morning , '' she announced , with so quaint an assumption of severity that Stephen was obliged to laugh .
Parsing [sent. 3362 len. 22]: She laughed with him , struggling out of her coat , and looking round daintily for a place to lay it .
Parsing [sent. 3363 len. 7]: `` That nail on the door !
Parsing [sent. 3364 len. 7]: There 's not a clean spot .
Parsing [sent. 3365 len. 5]: Now for the kettle !
Parsing [sent. 3366 len. 8]: You fill it , while I rummage .
Parsing [sent. 3367 len. 10]: What 's the most unlikely place for the tea ?
Parsing [sent. 3368 len. 5]: It will be there .
Parsing [sent. 3369 len. 16]: She 's the sort of muddler who 'd leave it loose among the potatoes . ''
Parsing [sent. 3370 len. 7]: `` It 's in the caddy .
Parsing [sent. 3371 len. 7]: The brown box on the dresser .
Parsing [sent. 3372 len. 7]: I 've found it before . ''
Parsing [sent. 3373 len. 5]: `` The caddy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3374 len. 10]: Pixie looked quite annoyed at so obvious a find .
Parsing [sent. 3375 len. 7]: `` Oh , so it is .
Parsing [sent. 3376 len. 14]: Where 's the butter then , and the bread , and the sugar ?
Parsing [sent. 3377 len. 5]: Where 's the spoons ?
Parsing [sent. 3378 len. 7]: Where does she put the cloths ?
Parsing [sent. 3379 len. 10]: Rake out that bottom bar to make a draught .
Parsing [sent. 3380 len. 7]: Does he get feverish at nights ?
Parsing [sent. 3381 len. 21]: It 's a mercy I brought a cake , for I do n't believe there 's a _ thing _ .
Parsing [sent. 3382 len. 7]: Does he take it strong ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3383 len. 31]: She was bustling about as she spoke , opening and shutting drawers , standing on tip-toe to peer over kitchen shelves , lifting the lids of dishes upon the dresser .
Parsing [sent. 3384 len. 44]: One question succeeded fast upon another , but she did not trouble herself to wait for a reply , and Stephen , watching with a flickering smile , was quite nonplussed when at last she paused , as if expectant of an answer .
Parsing [sent. 3385 len. 6]: `` What strong ? '' ''
Parsing [sent. 3386 len. 4]: _ Tea _ !
Parsing [sent. 3387 len. 6]: What else could it be ?
Parsing [sent. 3388 len. 7]: We were talking of tea . ''
Parsing [sent. 3389 len. 6]: `` I beg your pardon .
Parsing [sent. 3390 len. 4]: So we were .
Parsing [sent. 3391 len. 23]: Yes , he does like it strong , and there 's only one set of cups , white with a gold rim .
Parsing [sent. 3392 len. 17]: There were two left the other day , but it 's quite possible they have disappeared .
Parsing [sent. 3393 len. 7]: She is a champion breaker . ''
Parsing [sent. 3394 len. 12]: `` We 'll have tumblers then , '' Pixie said briskly .
Parsing [sent. 3395 len. 25]: `` The nicest tea I ever had was at a seaside inn where we made it ourselves in a bedroom to save the expense .
Parsing [sent. 3396 len. 14]: Oh , _ here _ they are , and here 's the milk .
Parsing [sent. 3397 len. 8]: Now we sha n't be long ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3398 len. 28]: Then suddenly , standing before the cupboard door , and tilting her head over her shoulder , '' _ When did you hear from Stanor _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3399 len. 15]: she asked , in a still , altered voice which struck like a blow .
Parsing [sent. 3400 len. 30]: Stephen Glynn gave no outward sign of surprise , yet that sudden question had sent racing half a dozen pulses , as voicing the words in his own mind .
Parsing [sent. 3401 len. 8]: `` When did you hear from Stanor ?
Parsing [sent. 3402 len. 10]: _ What _ do you hear from Stanor ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3403 len. 29]: The first sight of the girl 's face had added intensity to the curiosity of years -- a curiosity which within the last months had changed into anxiety .
Parsing [sent. 3404 len. 8]: He hesitated before answering the simple question .
Parsing [sent. 3405 len. 7]: `` He does not write often .
Parsing [sent. 3406 len. 20]: We had a good deal of correspondence when he decided to stay in New York the extra six months .
Parsing [sent. 3407 len. 22]: He seems to have acclimatised wonderfully , and to be absorbed in his work , unusually absorbed for his age . ''
Parsing [sent. 3408 len. 8]: `` But that is what you wanted .
Parsing [sent. 3409 len. 12]: You must be pleased about that , '' Pixie said quietly .
Parsing [sent. 3410 len. 39]: She was arranging the cups and saucers on the tray , but she looked at him as she spoke , a straight , sweet look , which yet held so much sadness that it cut like a knife .
Parsing [sent. 3411 len. 15]: `` Miss O'Shaughnessy , '' he cried impetuously , `` can you forgive me ?
Parsing [sent. 3412 len. 7]: I took too much upon myself .
Parsing [sent. 3413 len. 15]: I did it for the best , but -- two years is too long .
Parsing [sent. 3414 len. 4]: One settles down .
Parsing [sent. 3415 len. 23]: It was a blow to me when he stayed on , for my own sake , and -- '' Pixie nodded gravely .
Parsing [sent. 3416 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 3417 len. 5]: We were both sorry .
Parsing [sent. 3418 len. 19]: We wanted of course to see him , but you should not blame him for loving his work .
Parsing [sent. 3419 len. 22]: You blamed him before because he was changeable ; now he has done so well , you must be proud . ''
Parsing [sent. 3420 len. 9]: She smiled at him with determined cheerfulness . ''
Parsing [sent. 3421 len. 6]: _ I _ am proud .
Parsing [sent. 3422 len. 12]: And it is not as if it were making him ill .
Parsing [sent. 3423 len. 6]: He finds time to play .
Parsing [sent. 3424 len. 24]: Honor Ward often writes and she tells me -- '' `` Miss Ward seems an adept at play , '' returned Stephen dryly .
Parsing [sent. 3425 len. 27]: In truth , the lavishness of the entertainments which Honor had planned during the past two years had called the attention of even the English papers .
Parsing [sent. 3426 len. 42]: Pixie had read aloud descriptions thereof in the journals in the northern town where Captain Victor was still stationed , and Bridgie listening thereto had exclaimed in horror : `` Special liveries for all the men-servants just for that one evening !
Parsing [sent. 3427 len. 3]: How wicked !
Parsing [sent. 3428 len. 89]: All that money for a few hours , when poor children are starving , and myself wanting a velvet coat ... '' At first Pixie had divined that Honor was trying to drown her sorrow in gaiety , and was even guilty of a girlish desire to `` show off '' before her former lover , but as the months grew into years it was impossible to read her letters and not realise that her enjoyment was real , not feigned , and that she had outgrown regret .
Parsing [sent. 3429 len. 41]: Yes , Honor was happy ; and to judge from her accounts Stanor was happy too , able even in his busiest days to spare time to join the revels , and , indeed , to help in their organisation .
Parsing [sent. 3430 len. 9]: `` Miss Ward is an adept at play .
Parsing [sent. 3431 len. 23]: I do n't approve of these gorgeous entertainments , '' said Stephen , and Pixie 's eyes lightened with a mischievous flash .
Parsing [sent. 3432 len. 9]: `` Seems to me you are never satisfied !
Parsing [sent. 3433 len. 10]: Now for myself nothing could be gorgeous enough ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3434 len. 11]: She held out a brown teapot with a broken spout .
Parsing [sent. 3435 len. 6]: `` The water 's boiling .
Parsing [sent. 3436 len. 10]: Pour it in please , and do n't splash !
Parsing [sent. 3437 len. 12]: I 'll carry it right in , for Pat is impatient .
Parsing [sent. 3438 len. 8]: We must n't keep him waiting . ''
Parsing [sent. 3439 len. 29]: She waited until the pot was safely on the tray , and then added a warning : `` Please do n't talk about -- things -- before Pat .
Parsing [sent. 3440 len. 11]: He 'd worry , but I 'd like your advice .
Parsing [sent. 3441 len. 11]: Another time , perhaps , when we are alone . ''
Parsing [sent. 3442 len. 14]: Her eyes met his , gravely beseeching , and he looked searchingly back .
Parsing [sent. 3443 len. 6]: Yes , she had suffered .
Parsing [sent. 3444 len. 11]: It was no longer the face of a light-hearted child .
Parsing [sent. 3445 len. 25]: Loyal as ever , Pixie would not listen to a word against her friend , but what secret was she hiding in her heart ?
Parsing [sent. 3446 len. 3]: CHAPTER TWENTY .
Parsing [sent. 3447 len. 4]: STEPHEN IS ANSWERED .
Parsing [sent. 3448 len. 28]: For three days after Pixie 's arrival Stephen Glynn absented himself from the flat , and on the fourth day found a stormy , welcome awaiting him .
Parsing [sent. 3449 len. 10]: `` Ah , Glynn , is that you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3450 len. 4]: drawled Pat coldly .
Parsing [sent. 3451 len. 13]: `` Hope you have n't inconvenienced yourself , do n't you know .
Parsing [sent. 3452 len. 17]: After so many _ duty _ visits you are evidently thankful to be rid of me .
Parsing [sent. 3453 len. 15]: _ Pray _ do n't put yourself out any more on my account . ''
Parsing [sent. 3454 len. 15]: Stephen shook hands with Pixie and seated himself beside the bed with undaunted composure .
Parsing [sent. 3455 len. 6]: `` Rubbish , old fellow !
Parsing [sent. 3456 len. 5]: And you know it .
Parsing [sent. 3457 len. 11]: If you have enjoyed my visits , so have I .
Parsing [sent. 3458 len. 39]: But of course now that Miss O'Shaughnessy -- '' `` If it 's myself that 's the obstacle I can stay in my room , but if you 've any pity on me , _ come _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3459 len. 3]: interrupted Pixie .
Parsing [sent. 3460 len. 29]: `` My life 's not worth living towards the end of the afternoon when Pat is watching the clock , and fidgeting for the ring of the bell .
Parsing [sent. 3461 len. 17]: I 'm only his sister , you see , and he wants a _ man _ !
Parsing [sent. 3462 len. 38]: I 'll stay out of the room if you 'd rather ; though I 'm not saying , '' she concluded demurely , `` that I would n't be glad of a change of society myself ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3463 len. 10]: `` It 's horribly dull for the poor girl !
Parsing [sent. 3464 len. 18]: She does n't like to leave me , and I do n't like her going about alone .
Parsing [sent. 3465 len. 19]: You might take her about a bit , Glynn , if you were n't so neglectful and unfriendly !
Parsing [sent. 3466 len. 26]: To-morrow 's Sunday , and she 's dying to go to the Abbey ... '' `` May I have the pleasure , Miss O'Shaughnessy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3467 len. 36]: cried Stephen promptly , and Pixie wrinkled her nose and said -- `` You could n't say anything else but yes , but I 'll not spite myself just for the sake of seeming proud .
Parsing [sent. 3468 len. 11]: Come and take me , and come back to lunch .
Parsing [sent. 3469 len. 7]: You 'll get a good one .
Parsing [sent. 3470 len. 10]: I 've made some changes in this establishment . ''
Parsing [sent. 3471 len. 27]: `` She telegraphed to the Hilliards ' housekeeper , and she sent off a kitchen-maid -- a broth of a girl who romps through the work .
Parsing [sent. 3472 len. 8]: And cooks -- You wait and see !
Parsing [sent. 3473 len. 10]: I lie and dream of the next meal ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3474 len. 7]: Pat chuckled , with restored equanimity .
Parsing [sent. 3475 len. 32]: `` But if I _ am _ living in the lap of luxury _ I 'm _ not going to be chucked by you , old fellow , '' he added .
Parsing [sent. 3476 len. 10]: `` The more one has the more one wants .
Parsing [sent. 3477 len. 18]: I 've grown to count on your afternoon visit , and it upsets me to go without .
Parsing [sent. 3478 len. 11]: My temperature has gone up every night from sheer aggravation .
Parsing [sent. 3479 len. 9]: Is n't that true now , Pixie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3480 len. 8]: `` More blame to , you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3481 len. 3]: said Pixie .
Parsing [sent. 3482 len. 62]: But her eyes met Stephen 's with an anxiety which was not in keeping with her tone , and , in truth , after four days ' absence the face on the pillow appeared to the onlooker , woefully drawn and white , Stephen registered a vow that Pat 's temperature should not rise again through any neglect of his own .
Parsing [sent. 3483 len. 10]: `` All right , Pat , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3484 len. 37]: `` I 'll come as usual , and if it 's inconvenient you can turn me out ; and if Miss O'Shaughnessy will accept me for an escort I 'll be proud to take her about .
Parsing [sent. 3485 len. 9]: We 'll begin with the Abbey to-morrow . ''
Parsing [sent. 3486 len. 11]: `` That 's all right ; I thought you would .
Parsing [sent. 3487 len. 17]: What 's the good of a prospective uncle if he ca n't make himself useful ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3488 len. 45]: It was the first time Pat had made any reference to Stanor Vaughan , for , like the rest of the family , his pride had been stung by the non-appearance of Pixie 's love , at the expiration of the prescribed two years .
Parsing [sent. 3489 len. 39]: Pat knew that occasional letters passed between the young couple , and that the understanding between them appeared unbroken , but it was a poor sort of lover who would voluntarily add to the term of his exile .
Parsing [sent. 3490 len. 40]: During the four days which Pixie had spent in the flat , almost every subject under the sun had been discussed but the one which presumably lay nearest the girl 's heart , and that had been consistently shunned .
Parsing [sent. 3491 len. 42]: It was only a desire to justify a claim on his friend 's services which had driven Pat to refer to the subject now , and he sincerely wished he had remained silent as he noted the effect of his words .
Parsing [sent. 3492 len. 8]: Stephen and Pixie stared steadily into space .
Parsing [sent. 3493 len. 24]: Neither spoke , neither smiled ; their fixed , blank eyes appeared to give the impression that they had not heard his words .
Parsing [sent. 3494 len. 22]: In another moment the silence would have become embarrassing had not Pixie rung the bell and given an order for tea .
Parsing [sent. 3495 len. 15]: `` Is this your first experience of living in a flat , Miss O'Shaughnessy ?
Parsing [sent. 3496 len. 14]: How do you like it , as far as you 've got ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3497 len. 31]: Stephen asked , with a valiant resolve to second Pixie 's efforts , and she turned her face towards him , slightly flushed , but frank and candid as ever .
Parsing [sent. 3498 len. 10]: `` I love it -- it 's so social !
Parsing [sent. 3499 len. 11]: You know everyone 's business as well as your own .
Parsing [sent. 3500 len. 18]: The floors are _ supposed _ to be sound-proof , but really they 're so many sounding-boards .
Parsing [sent. 3501 len. 19]: The couple above had a quarrel last night -- at the high points we could hear every word .
Parsing [sent. 3502 len. 30]: It was as good as a theatre , though , of course -- '' she lengthened her face with a pretence of gravity -- '' 't was very sad !
Parsing [sent. 3503 len. 13]: But they 've made it up to-day , because she 's singing .
Parsing [sent. 3504 len. 20]: She has one song that she sings a dozen times every day ... something about parting from a lover .
Parsing [sent. 3505 len. 23]: Pat says she 's been at it for months past -- ` _ Since _ we parted _ yester _ eve . '
Parsing [sent. 3506 len. 8]: ... She feels it , poor creature !
Parsing [sent. 3507 len. 28]: I suggested to Pat that we might board him , so that he might always be on the spot , and she would n't have to part .
Parsing [sent. 3508 len. 9]: He says it would be worth the money .
Parsing [sent. 3509 len. 15]: ... The lady below sings ` Come back to Erin ' by the hour .
Parsing [sent. 3510 len. 8]: She 's _ always _ singing it !
Parsing [sent. 3511 len. 40]: We thought of sending a polite note to say that we had given her request every consideration , but that owing to the unsettled condition of politics in that country we really did not see our way to move .
Parsing [sent. 3512 len. 8]: ... And they have anthracite stoves . ''
Parsing [sent. 3513 len. 7]: `` Why should n't they ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3514 len. 3]: Stephen asked .
Parsing [sent. 3515 len. 29]: He had greeted Pixie 's description with the delight of one who finds a painful situation suddenly irradiated by humour , but the anthracite stoves conveyed no meaning .
Parsing [sent. 3516 len. 11]: `` Why should n't they , if they choose ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3517 len. 5]: Pixie scowled disapproval . ''
Parsing [sent. 3518 len. 5]: _ So _ selfish !
Parsing [sent. 3519 len. 8]: Noise like earthquakes every time they rake .
Parsing [sent. 3520 len. 9]: I wake every morning thinking I 'm dead .
Parsing [sent. 3521 len. 8]: This morning I counted sixty separate rakes !
Parsing [sent. 3522 len. 22]: Now , here 's a problem for you , Mr Glynn -- How can you avenge yourself on an upstairs flatter ?
Parsing [sent. 3523 len. 28]: If it 's below : it 's quite easy -- you just bang with the poker ; but how can you do that on your own ceiling ?
Parsing [sent. 3524 len. 10]: 'T is no consolation to break the plaster ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3525 len. 36]: The tea was carried in as she spoke , and she rose to seat herself at the table , giving a friendly smile at the trim maid who had replaced the arrant `` housekeeper . ''
Parsing [sent. 3526 len. 6]: `` Hot scones , Moffatt ?
Parsing [sent. 3527 len. 8]: You _ do _ spoil us ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3528 len. 14]: she said cordially , and the girl left the room abeam with content .
Parsing [sent. 3529 len. 22]: `` She adores me -- all maids do , '' announced Pixie , with her complacent air well to the fore .
Parsing [sent. 3530 len. 9]: `` It 's the way I treat them .
Parsing [sent. 3531 len. 16]: My sister , now -- Bridgie Victor -- she 's a coward with her maids .
Parsing [sent. 3532 len. 39]: She lies awake half the night rehearsing the best ways of hinting that she 'd prefer pastry lighter than lead , after begging us all as a personal favour to eat it in case cook should be hurt .
Parsing [sent. 3533 len. 29]: When I have a house -- '' She stopped short and busied herself with her duties , and neither of her listeners questioned her further on the subject .
Parsing [sent. 3534 len. 16]: Tea was a merry meal , and Pat consumed the dainty fare with undisguised enjoyment .
Parsing [sent. 3535 len. 29]: `` That 's the pull of an accident , '' he declared , as he helped himself to a third scone , '' _ ye can eat _ !
Parsing [sent. 3536 len. 12]: It 's awful to think of poor beggars on a diet .
Parsing [sent. 3537 len. 15]: ... Let 's have muffins to-morrow , Pixie , _ swimming _ with butter .
Parsing [sent. 3538 len. 5]: Glynn 's coming ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3539 len. 6]: `` Do n't tempt me !
Parsing [sent. 3540 len. 17]: I am coming to lunch , but you wo n't want me to stay on . ''
Parsing [sent. 3541 len. 3]: `` Rubbish !
Parsing [sent. 3542 len. 5]: We _ do _ .
Parsing [sent. 3543 len. 13]: Stay for the whole day , and Pixie shall sing to us .
Parsing [sent. 3544 len. 16]: It 's the least she can do , if you take her to church . ''
Parsing [sent. 3545 len. 15]: Stephen looked at his hostess with a glance curiously compounded of dread and expectation .
Parsing [sent. 3546 len. 28]: Music was the passion of his life , so true a passion that it was torture to him to hear the travesties which passed under its name .
Parsing [sent. 3547 len. 38]: Bearing in mind the very small proportion of girls who could really sing , he wished that the proposal had never been made , since the result would probably mean a jarring episode in a delightful day .
Parsing [sent. 3548 len. 12]: `` But you have no piano , '' he said uncertainly .
Parsing [sent. 3549 len. 21]: `` How can -- '' `` It 's not a piano would stop me , if I wanted to sing .
Parsing [sent. 3550 len. 17]: I do n't need an accompaniment , '' Pixie declared , and Stephen shuddered in spirit .
Parsing [sent. 3551 len. 9]: Unaccompanied songs were terrible ordeals to the listeners .
Parsing [sent. 3552 len. 8]: Eyes as well as ears were tortured .
Parsing [sent. 3553 len. 7]: One never knew where to look !
Parsing [sent. 3554 len. 35]: He pondered as he drank his tea how the situation could be ameliorated , if not escaped , and reminded himself thankfully that if necessary he could hire a piano and send it in .
Parsing [sent. 3555 len. 18]: Then , looking up , he met Pat 's eyes fixed upon him with a quizzical smile .
Parsing [sent. 3556 len. 41]: Pat showed at times an uncomfortable faculty for , reading his friends ' thoughts , and Stephen realised that it was in force at this minute , and was thankful that at least it did not find vent in words .
Parsing [sent. 3557 len. 22]: Pixie 's happy complacence about her own powers was so far removed from ordinary conceit that he dreaded to wound it .
Parsing [sent. 3558 len. 20]: He therefore hastily changed the conversation , and avoided the subject of music for the rest of his call .
Parsing [sent. 3559 len. 32]: The next morning , after arranging for Pat 's comfort , Pixie retired to her eerie , and spent what appeared to the invalid an unconscionably long time over her toilette .
Parsing [sent. 3560 len. 53]: After the cheerful manner of flats , by slightly raising the voice it was easy to carry on a conversation with a person in an adjoining room , and Pat therefore favoured his sister with a statement that he `` expected to see something pretty fetching , after all this time ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3561 len. 3]: `` Ha !
Parsing [sent. 3562 len. 3]: Ha ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3563 len. 14]: cried Pixie in return , and her voice gave no hint of modesty .
Parsing [sent. 3564 len. 25]: Nevertheless , and for all his expectations , Pat gave a gasp of surprise when a few minutes later she sailed into the room .
Parsing [sent. 3565 len. 36]: She wore a coat and skirt of a soft , mouse-coloured velvet , very quiet and nondescript in hue , and the hat , with its curling brim , was covered with the same material .
Parsing [sent. 3566 len. 38]: So far , very douce and quiet ; but entirely round the hat , and curling gracefully over one side , was a magnificent ostrich plume , which was plainly the pride of its owner 's heart .
Parsing [sent. 3567 len. 23]: She tossed her head in answer to Pat 's uplifted hands , pirouetted round and round , and struck a telling attitude .
Parsing [sent. 3568 len. 3]: `` Yes !
Parsing [sent. 3569 len. 7]: _ Ai n't _ I smart ?
Parsing [sent. 3570 len. 7]: Me dear , regard the feather !
Parsing [sent. 3571 len. 29]: I 've longed for years to possess a scrumptious feather , and have talked by the hour , trying to convince Bridgie it was economical in the end .
Parsing [sent. 3572 len. 5]: But she would n't .
Parsing [sent. 3573 len. 17]: She said 't was expensive at the start , and she could n't see any further .
Parsing [sent. 3574 len. 7]: Sometimes she _ is _ dense .
Parsing [sent. 3575 len. 13]: She ca n't help it , poor creature , living with Dick !
Parsing [sent. 3576 len. 16]: However , Esmeralda did , and she bought it in Paris to match my coat .
Parsing [sent. 3577 len. 8]: It measures a yard , loved one !
Parsing [sent. 3578 len. 16]: And _ is n't _ it kind of it to turn blue at the end ?
Parsing [sent. 3579 len. 16]: That little touch of blue just behind my ear _ does _ set me off !
Parsing [sent. 3580 len. 5]: Honest Indian , Patrick !
Parsing [sent. 3581 len. 25]: If you did n't know better , and came suddenly into the room , would n't you think I was a pretty girl ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3582 len. 5]: `` I should ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3583 len. 22]: answered Pat ; but a moment later he added , with true brotherly candour , `` But you 're not . ''
Parsing [sent. 3584 len. 9]: `` All the more credit to me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3585 len. 4]: retorted Pixie glibly .
Parsing [sent. 3586 len. 29]: She lifted a chair which stood at the left of the fireplace , carried it to a similar position on the right , and seated herself upon it .
Parsing [sent. 3587 len. 7]: `` This side 's the best .
Parsing [sent. 3588 len. 17]: -- I must sit here , and let Mr Glynn see my splendour in full blast .
Parsing [sent. 3589 len. 7]: Wo n't he be pleased ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3590 len. 6]: `` He 'll never notice .
Parsing [sent. 3591 len. 53]: Glynn 's above hats , '' Pat maintained ; but , nevertheless , he could not take his own eyes off the dainty grey figure , with the piquant face smiling beneath the brim of the wide hat , and that fascinating little tip of blue ending the long , grey plume .
Parsing [sent. 3592 len. 19]: His admiration showed in his eyes , but he felt it his duty to be bracing in words .
Parsing [sent. 3593 len. 17]: `` I never thought I should live to see _ you _ conceited about clothes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3594 len. 11]: `` Ye _ do _ get these shocks in life .
Parsing [sent. 3595 len. 8]: It 's a sad old world ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3596 len. 15]: answered Pixie , and grimaced at him saucily , as she buttoned her glove .
Parsing [sent. 3597 len. 13]: And , after all , Stephen Glynn never did notice the feather .
Parsing [sent. 3598 len. 20]: For a ten-pound note he could not have described the next day a single article of Pixie 's attire .
Parsing [sent. 3599 len. 60]: He was aware , however , it was pleasant to walk about with Pixie O'Shaughnessy , and that passers-by seemed to envy him his post , and he was relieved that she was disfigured by none of the extremes of an ugly fashion ; and , after all , nine men out of ten rarely get beyond this point .
Parsing [sent. 3600 len. 30]: They sallied forth together , bidding Pat sleep all morning so as to be ready to talk all afternoon , and descended the gaunt stone stairs to the hall .
Parsing [sent. 3601 len. 13]: They walked quietly , but with enjoyment in each other 's company .
Parsing [sent. 3602 len. 40]: The usual crowd blocked the Abbey door , and Stephen and Pixie stood waiting under the statue of the `` third great Canning '' for some time , before at last they were escorted to seats in the nave .
Parsing [sent. 3603 len. 21]: The sermon , unfortunately , they could not hear , but the exquisite service was to both a deep delight .
Parsing [sent. 3604 len. 36]: Remembering the conversation of the night before , Stephen dreaded lest Pixie should be one of the mistaken ones who sing persistently through an elaborate choral service , thereby nullifying its effect for those around .
Parsing [sent. 3605 len. 49]: He was thankful to find that his fears were unnecessary , but once or twice in an unusually beautiful refrain he imagined that his ear caught the sound of a deep , rich note -- a soft echo of the strain itself , evoked by an irresistible impulse .
Parsing [sent. 3606 len. 22]: He looked inquiringly at his companion , but her head was bent and the brim of her hat concealed her face .
Parsing [sent. 3607 len. 42]: Her stillness , her reverence appealed to his heart , for it was easy to see that she was enjoying the music not as a mere concert , but , above all things , as an accompaniment to the words themselves .
Parsing [sent. 3608 len. 37]: One time , when he glanced at her as she rose from her knees , he surprised a glimmer of tears in her _ eyes _ , and the sight brought a stab to his heart .
Parsing [sent. 3609 len. 5]: Why should she cry ?
Parsing [sent. 3610 len. 21]: What was the reason of the air of repression and strain which from time to time flitted across her face ?
Parsing [sent. 3611 len. 7]: If it were Stanor 's doing .
Parsing [sent. 3612 len. 13]: ... Stephen frowned , and resolutely turned his attention to the service .
Parsing [sent. 3613 len. 45]: They came out of the Abbey to the majestic strains of the organ -- out of the dim , blurred light shining shaft-like across the glowing mosaic of gold , and marble , and great jewelled windows , into the hard , everyday world .
Parsing [sent. 3614 len. 36]: The pavements were crowded with pedestrians hurrying here and there ; restaurants had opened their doors , tobacco merchants and newspaper vendors were hard at work , and country-bred Pixie stared around in amazed disapproval .
Parsing [sent. 3615 len. 26]: They crossed the crowded thoroughfares and , led by Stephen , found quiet byways in which it was possible to talk in comparative comfort alone .
Parsing [sent. 3616 len. 16]: `` It was better even than I expected , and that 's saying so much !
Parsing [sent. 3617 len. 12]: It does one good to go to a service like that .
Parsing [sent. 3618 len. 8]: It 's so _ big _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3619 len. 7]: `` The -- the Abbey ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3620 len. 11]: queried Stephen vaguely , and Pixie gave a quick denial .
Parsing [sent. 3621 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 3622 len. 4]: _ No _ !
Parsing [sent. 3623 len. 7]: Not only the building -- everything !
Parsing [sent. 3624 len. 13]: There 's an atmosphere of peace , and dignity , and calm .
Parsing [sent. 3625 len. 8]: One gets away from littleness and quarrelling .
Parsing [sent. 3626 len. 29]: It 's so sad when people quarrel about religion , and one sect disputes with another ... '' `` It is indeed , '' replied Stephen , sighing .
Parsing [sent. 3627 len. 20]: `` The chances of conciliation would be so much greater if they fought with honey , not with gall .
Parsing [sent. 3628 len. 13]: ... The world needs kindness -- '' `` Oh , it does !
Parsing [sent. 3629 len. 9]: There is such sorrow , such pain ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3630 len. 17]: Pixie 's voice rang suddenly sharp , and a wave of emotion flitted over her face .
Parsing [sent. 3631 len. 24]: She raised her eyes to his , and said suddenly , in a voice of melting pathos : '' _ Her face _ !
Parsing [sent. 3632 len. 6]: ... That girl 's face !
Parsing [sent. 3633 len. 8]: All these years I 've never forgotten .
Parsing [sent. 3634 len. 9]: ... It 's lain _ here _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3635 len. 9]: She touched her heart with an eloquent finger .
Parsing [sent. 3636 len. 34]: `` All these years -- every night -- I 've prayed that they might meet ... '' She shook her head with a determined gesture , as though shaking off a haunting thought .
Parsing [sent. 3637 len. 23]: `` I could n't forget , you see , because -- it taught me ... things I had not understood -- ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3638 len. 8]: `` Yes , '' said Stephen dully .
Parsing [sent. 3639 len. 11]: For his life he could not have said another word .
Parsing [sent. 3640 len. 10]: He waited with dread to hear the next words .
Parsing [sent. 3641 len. 10]: `` But it was _ worth _ learning ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3642 len. 4]: Pixie said bravely .
Parsing [sent. 3643 len. 7]: `` I was glad to learn .
Parsing [sent. 3644 len. 9]: Love is such a big , big thing .
Parsing [sent. 3645 len. 12]: When it is given to you it 's a big responsibility .
Parsing [sent. 3646 len. 15]: You must not fail ; nothing in the world must make you fail ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3647 len. 5]: Stephen said no word .
Parsing [sent. 3648 len. 16]: The questions which had filled his brain for the last five days were answered now .
Parsing [sent. 3649 len. 8]: There was no more room for doubt .
Parsing [sent. 3650 len. 25]: Pixie O'Shaughnessy was ready and waiting to marry Stanor Vaughan at any time when it pleased him to come home and claim her promise .
Parsing [sent. 3651 len. 4]: CHAPTER TWENTY ONE .
Parsing [sent. 3652 len. 4]: A MUSICAL EVENING .
Parsing [sent. 3653 len. 27]: Pixie had recovered her spirits by the time that the flat was reached , but the invalid was discovered in a distinctly `` grumpy '' mood .
Parsing [sent. 3654 len. 28]: Like many enforced stay-at-homes , his unselfishness bore him gallantly over the point of speeding the parting guests , and expressing sincere good wishes for their enjoyment .
Parsing [sent. 3655 len. 78]: But the long , long hours spent alone , the contrast between their lot and his own , the rebellious longing to be up and doing , all these foes preyed upon the mind , and by the time that the voyagers returned , a cool , martyr-like greeting replaced the kindliness of the farewell , which was sad , and selfish , and unworthy , but let those suspend their judgment who have never been tried !
Parsing [sent. 3656 len. 3]: `` Really ?
Parsing [sent. 3657 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 3658 len. 8]: _ Quite _ well , thank you .
Parsing [sent. 3659 len. 5]: Did you really ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3660 len. 41]: ... The cold , clipped sentences fell like ice on the listeners ' ears , and Pixie , going out of the room , turned a swift glance at Stephen Glynn , and wrinkled her nose in an expressive grimace .
Parsing [sent. 3661 len. 15]: Somehow or other Stephen felt his spirits racing upward at sight of that grimace .
Parsing [sent. 3662 len. 31]: There was a suggestion of intimacy about it , amounting even to confidence : it denoted a _ camaraderie _ of spirit which was as flattering as it was delightful .
Parsing [sent. 3663 len. 38]: Pat , as usual , recovered his good humour at the sight of food , and thoroughly enjoyed the simple but well-cooked meal , while Pixie and Stephen tactfully avoided the subject of their morning 's excursion .
Parsing [sent. 3664 len. 13]: Time enough later on to describe the beauties of that Abbey service !
Parsing [sent. 3665 len. 8]: `` Moffatt is going out this afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 3666 len. 14]: A friend is to call for her and bring her back this evening .
Parsing [sent. 3667 len. 36]: It will be a change for the creature , '' announced Pixie when the meal was finished , and , meeting Pat 's eye , she added quickly , `` I 'll make tea . ''
Parsing [sent. 3668 len. 6]: `` What about supper ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3669 len. 4]: queried Pat sternly .
Parsing [sent. 3670 len. 21]: `` If there 's a meal in the week which I enjoy better than another it is Sunday night supper .
Parsing [sent. 3671 len. 11]: What 's going to happen about it to-night ? '' ''
Parsing [sent. 3672 len. 7]: ` Deed I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 3673 len. 4]: Do n't fuss !
Parsing [sent. 3674 len. 10]: It 's beyond me to think two meals ahead .
Parsing [sent. 3675 len. 5]: There 's cold meat .
Parsing [sent. 3676 len. 14]: ... I 'll rummage up something when it comes to the time . ''
Parsing [sent. 3677 len. 8]: Pat turned gloomily to his friend . ''
Parsing [sent. 3678 len. 10]: _ You 'd _ better be off , Glynn .
Parsing [sent. 3679 len. 16]: I asked you to stay for the day , but in view of unforeseen circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 3680 len. 13]: ... Pixie evidently puts Moffatt 's pleasure before our food . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 3681 len. 6]: _ I do _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3682 len. 4]: cried Pixie sturdily .
Parsing [sent. 3683 len. 18]: Stephen smiled , his bright , transforming smile , and said quickly -- `` I 'll stay !
Parsing [sent. 3684 len. 20]: I 'd like to , if you will just excuse me one moment while I telephone to my man .
Parsing [sent. 3685 len. 13]: You have a telephone , I think , in the basement ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3686 len. 3]: Pixie shuddered .
Parsing [sent. 3687 len. 38]: `` They have ; in an ice-box , where every draught that was ever born whirls around your feet , and if you speak loud enough , every maid in the place will hear what you say .
Parsing [sent. 3688 len. 8]: It 's quite diverting to listen ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3689 len. 79]: Stephen went off laughing , and Pixie shook up Pat 's pillows , bathed his hands , and kissed him several times on the tip of his nose , a proceeding which he considered offensive to his dignity , and then went off to change the crushable velvet skirt for a house dress of her favourite rose hue -- a quaint little garment made in a picturesque style , which had no connection whatever with the prevailing fashion .
Parsing [sent. 3690 len. 41]: When she returned to the sitting-room she seated herself on the floor beside the fire , and Pat , now entirely restored to equanimity and a little ashamed of his previous ill-humour , himself inquired about the morning 's experiences .
Parsing [sent. 3691 len. 28]: Like all the O'Shaughnessys he was intensely musical , and during his sojourn in London had taken every opportunity to hear all the good concerts within reach .
Parsing [sent. 3692 len. 32]: He now wanted to hear about the music in the Abbey , and especially of the anthem , and at the mention of it Pixie drew a deep sigh of enjoyment .
Parsing [sent. 3693 len. 16]: `` Oh , Pat , a boy sang ` Oh , for the wings ' !
Parsing [sent. 3694 len. 7]: If you could have heard it !
Parsing [sent. 3695 len. 19]: -- A clear , clear voice , so thrillingly sweet , soaring away up to that wonderful roof .
Parsing [sent. 3696 len. 8]: And he sang with such feeling . ''
Parsing [sent. 3697 len. 33]: ... She began softly humming the air , and Stephen knew then for a certainty whence had come those rich , soft notes which had come to his ears in the Abbey .
Parsing [sent. 3698 len. 10]: `` Sing it , Pixie , sing it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3699 len. 4]: cried Pat impatiently .
Parsing [sent. 3700 len. 12]: `` You promised , and it 's one of my favourites .
Parsing [sent. 3701 len. 8]: Go on ; I 'll accompany ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3702 len. 5]: Stephen looked round inquiringly .
Parsing [sent. 3703 len. 22]: No piano was in the room , no musical instrument of any kind , and Pat lay helpless upon his bed .
Parsing [sent. 3704 len. 8]: How , then , could he accompany ?
Parsing [sent. 3705 len. 37]: The O'Shaughnessy ingenuity had , however , overcome greater difficulties than this , and it was not the first time by many that Pat had hummed an effective and harmonious background to his sister 's songs .
Parsing [sent. 3706 len. 20]: As for Pixie , she opened her mouth and began to sing as simply and naturally as a bird .
Parsing [sent. 3707 len. 29]: She had a lovely voice , mezzo-soprano in range , and though she now kept it sweetly subdued , the hearer realised that it had also considerable power .
Parsing [sent. 3708 len. 46]: She sang as all true singers do -- as if the action gave to herself the purest joy , her head tilted slightly on one side , as if to listen more intently to each clear , sweet note as it fell from her lips .
Parsing [sent. 3709 len. 27]: ... '' _ Oh , for the wings , for the wings of a dove ; far away , far away would I roam _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 3710 len. 32]: ... The words blotted out for the hearers the gathering twilight in the prosaic little room ; far away , far away soared their thoughts to heights lofty and beautiful . ''
Parsing [sent. 3711 len. 19]: _ In the wilderness build me a nest , and remain there for ever at rest _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 3712 len. 19]: ... How had so young a thing learnt to put so wonderful a meaning into that last word ?
Parsing [sent. 3713 len. 40]: Pat 's rolling accompaniment swelled and sank ; now and again for a phrase he softly joined in the words , and in the concluding phrase still another voice joined in in a soft tenor note agreeable to hear .
Parsing [sent. 3714 len. 12]: Pixie 's eyes met Stephen 's with a glow of triumph .
Parsing [sent. 3715 len. 7]: `` He _ sings _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3716 len. 4]: she cried quickly .
Parsing [sent. 3717 len. 9]: `` Pat , he sings -- pure tenor !
Parsing [sent. 3718 len. 11]: Oh , what music we can have , what trios !
Parsing [sent. 3719 len. 5]: Is n't it delightful ?
Parsing [sent. 3720 len. 16]: You can have real concerts now , old man , without leaving the flat ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3721 len. 16]: `` It was a very beautiful solo , Miss O'Shaughnessy , '' said Stephen gravely .
Parsing [sent. 3722 len. 17]: He was still too much under the influence of the strain to think of future events .
Parsing [sent. 3723 len. 34]: As long as he lived he would remember to-day 's experience , and see before him the picture of Pixie O'Shaughnessy in her rose frock , with the firelight shining on her face .
Parsing [sent. 3724 len. 31]: Her unconsciousness had added largely to the charm of the moment , but now that the tension was relaxed there was a distinct air of complacence in her reply . ''
Parsing [sent. 3725 len. 10]: 'T is a gift ; we all have it .
Parsing [sent. 3726 len. 27]: The concerts we had at Knock , and every one playing a separate instrument , with not a thing to help us but our own hands !
Parsing [sent. 3727 len. 5]: I was the flute .
Parsing [sent. 3728 len. 21]: D'ye remember , Pat , the way I whistled a flute till ye all stopped to listen to me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3729 len. 9]: `` I do not , '' said Pat .
Parsing [sent. 3730 len. 25]: `` I was the ` cello myself , fiddling with a ruler on me own knees , double pedalling with _ two _ knees !
Parsing [sent. 3731 len. 7]: I had no thought for flutes .
Parsing [sent. 3732 len. 14]: Ye made the most noise , I 'll say that for ye ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3733 len. 34]: As usual in any discussion , brother and sister fell back to the brogue of their youth , which time and absence had softened to just an agreeable hint of an Irish accent .
Parsing [sent. 3734 len. 17]: Stephen smiled with amusement , and expressed a wish to hear the exhibition on another day .
Parsing [sent. 3735 len. 25]: `` But do sing us something else now , '' he said ; `` something worthy to come after ` The Wings . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 3736 len. 61]: And for the next hour , while the light waned till they could no longer see one another across the room , Pixie sang one beautiful strain after another , always in the same soft , restrained voice , which could neither disturb the neighbours above or below , nor be too strong for the size of the little room .
Parsing [sent. 3737 len. 28]: It was not show singing -- rather was it a series of `` tryings over , '' prefaced by `` Oh , do you know this ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3738 len. 10]: or `` Do n't you love that bit ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3739 len. 25]: so that each man felt at liberty to join in as the impulse took him , till at times all three were singing together .
Parsing [sent. 3740 len. 37]: The hours sped by with wonderful quickness , and when tea-time arrived Stephen insisted upon his right to help his hostess to clear away the meal , and when they returned to the sitting-room , lo !
Parsing [sent. 3741 len. 33]: Pat had fallen asleep , and there was nothing to do for it but to return to the kitchen , now immaculately clean and neat under the rule of the admirable Moffatt .
Parsing [sent. 3742 len. 38]: `` We might as well begin to think about supper , and forage around , '' Pixie suggested , but Stephen echoed her own dislike of thinking of meals too far ahead , and pled for delay .
Parsing [sent. 3743 len. 27]: `` It 's rather a strain to sit and look at cold meat for a solid hour at a stretch , do n't you think ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3744 len. 4]: he asked persuasively .
Parsing [sent. 3745 len. 7]: `` It would spoil my appetite .
Parsing [sent. 3746 len. 9]: Ca n't we just -- be quiet ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3747 len. 18]: `` You can , '' was Pixie 's candid answer ; `` I 'm going to write !
Parsing [sent. 3748 len. 24]: I 've the greediest family for letters ; do as I will , there 's never a time when somebody is n't grumbling !
Parsing [sent. 3749 len. 21]: Never mind me , if you want to smoke ; I approve of men smoking , it keeps them quiet .
Parsing [sent. 3750 len. 8]: Can I get you a book ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3751 len. 5]: Stephen shook his head .
Parsing [sent. 3752 len. 21]: Pat 's library did not appeal to his more literary taste , and he announced himself content without further employment .
Parsing [sent. 3753 len. 10]: `` Oh , well then , _ talk _ !
Parsing [sent. 3754 len. 25]: It wo n't disturb me , '' said Pixie easily ; `` I 'll just listen or not , according as it 's interesting .
Parsing [sent. 3755 len. 8]: I 'm accustomed to it with Bridgie .
Parsing [sent. 3756 len. 32]: If you want to set her tongue going , just sit down and begin to write ... '' Stephen , however , had no intention of taking advantage of the permission .
Parsing [sent. 3757 len. 30]: He was abundantly content to sit in his comfortable chair , enjoy his novel surroundings -LRB- how very cheerful and attractive a _ clean _ kitchen could be ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 3758 len. 17]: smoke his cigarette , and watch Pixie scribbling at fever pace over innumerable pages of notepaper .
Parsing [sent. 3759 len. 18]: There were frequent snatches of conversation , but invariably it was Pixie herself who led the way .
Parsing [sent. 3760 len. 11]: `` D'you illustrate your letters when you write them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3761 len. 6]: she asked at one time .
Parsing [sent. 3762 len. 5]: `` I always do !
Parsing [sent. 3763 len. 9]: Realistic , you know , and saves time .
Parsing [sent. 3764 len. 37]: At this present moment -- '' she drew back from the table , screwing up one eye , and holding aloft her pen in truly professional fashion -- `` I 'm drawing _ You _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3765 len. 6]: `` May I see ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3766 len. 4]: `` You may .
Parsing [sent. 3767 len. 19]: ... It 's not _ quite _ right about the chair legs , they get so mixed up .
Parsing [sent. 3768 len. 29]: Perspective never was my strong point , '' said Pixie , holding out a sheet and pointing to the masterpiece in question with the end of her pen .
Parsing [sent. 3769 len. 4]: `` There ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3770 len. 35]: Stephen looked and beheld a rough drawing of a preternaturally thin man , with preternatural large eyes , holding a cigarette in a hand joined to an arm which had evidently suffered severe dislocation .
Parsing [sent. 3771 len. 22]: It was the type of drawing affected by schoolboys and girls , yet it had a distinct cleverness of its own .
Parsing [sent. 3772 len. 40]: Despite the cart-wheel eyes and the skeleton frame there _ was _ a resemblance -- there was more than a resemblance , it was actually _ like _ , and Stephen acclaimed the fact by a shout of laughter .
Parsing [sent. 3773 len. 4]: `` I say !
Parsing [sent. 3774 len. 5]: Could I have it ?
Parsing [sent. 3775 len. 6]: It 's uncommonly good ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3776 len. 5]: Pixie shook her head .
Parsing [sent. 3777 len. 6]: `` It 's for Bridgie .
Parsing [sent. 3778 len. 6]: -- Ye notice the mouth ?
Parsing [sent. 3779 len. 9]: Did you know it twisted when you thought ?
Parsing [sent. 3780 len. 10]: Are n't they _ nice _ , narrow boots ?
Parsing [sent. 3781 len. 9]: I 'll do one for you another day .
Parsing [sent. 3782 len. 6]: ... Turn over the page !
Parsing [sent. 3783 len. 16]: There 's another of Pat , as he will look at the supper to-night . ''
Parsing [sent. 3784 len. 67]: The second drawing was even rougher than the first , but again the faculty for hitting off a likeness was displayed , for Pat , reclining on a bed sloping at a perilous angle towards the floor , gazed at a fragment of mutton-bone with drooping lids and peaking brows , which represented so precisely his expression when injured , that Stephen shouted once again . ''
Parsing [sent. 3785 len. 6]: _ Succes fou _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3786 len. 14]: commented Pixie jauntily , as she settled herself once more to her work .
Parsing [sent. 3787 len. 9]: `` Quite a gift , have n't I ?
Parsing [sent. 3788 len. 16]: Could n't do pretties to save my life , but I _ can _ caricature !
Parsing [sent. 3789 len. 10]: Now , please , _ do _ be quiet !
Parsing [sent. 3790 len. 33]: I must get on ... '' Half an hour later a loud rapping on the wall announced the awakening of the invalid , who was once more discovered in a fractious mood .
Parsing [sent. 3791 len. 3]: `` Asleep !
Parsing [sent. 3792 len. 2]: Nonsense !
Parsing [sent. 3793 len. 6]: For two minutes , perhaps .
Parsing [sent. 3794 len. 20]: How d'you suppose _ any _ fellow could sleep , with you two shrieking with laughter every two minutes !
Parsing [sent. 3795 len. 25]: If you choose to keep your jokes to yourself , all right , it 's nothing to me ; but it 's half-past seven .
Parsing [sent. 3796 len. 6]: ... Where 's supper ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3797 len. 22]: Even as he spoke another rap sounded on the front door -- a brisk , imperative rap which brooked no delay .
Parsing [sent. 3798 len. 28]: Pixie darted forward , imagining a surprise visit from the doctor , and found herself confronted by a man in black , standing sentinel over a hamper .
Parsing [sent. 3799 len. 8]: `` Mr O'Shaughnessy 's flat , madam ?
Parsing [sent. 3800 len. 23]: I have instructions from Mr Glynn -- '' `` All right , Saunders , bring it in , bring it in ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3801 len. 4]: cried Stephen quickly .
Parsing [sent. 3802 len. 18]: He met Pixie 's eyes , flushed , and stammered -- `` It 's ... supper ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3803 len. 4]: he said lamely .
Parsing [sent. 3804 len. 4]: `` I telephoned .
Parsing [sent. 3805 len. 13]: It seemed a good plan , and I thought that , Pat .
Parsing [sent. 3806 len. 9]: -- Do you _ mind _ ? '' ''
Parsing [sent. 3807 len. 5]: _ Mind _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3808 len. 5]: repeated Pixie , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 3809 len. 5]: `` Faith I do !
Parsing [sent. 3810 len. 23]: I mind very much ; but it 's the right way about ; it wo n't be cold mutton , after all !
Parsing [sent. 3811 len. 9]: I 'll have to draw another picture . ''
Parsing [sent. 3812 len. 21]: The man carried the hamper into the sitting-room , unpacked it deftly , and laid the contents on the table .
Parsing [sent. 3813 len. 23]: Soup , smoking hot from a thermos flask , chicken and salad , a shape of cream , and a fragrant pineapple .
Parsing [sent. 3814 len. 19]: Pat 's lips ceased to droop , his eyebrows to peak : his dark eyes lit with enjoyment .
Parsing [sent. 3815 len. 6]: `` Good old Glynn ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3816 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 3817 len. 6]: `` What a great idea !
Parsing [sent. 3818 len. 36]: Now let 's begin , and eat right through ... '' As he took part in the happy meal which followed , Stephen Glynn reflected that generosity in giving went also with generosity in receiving .
Parsing [sent. 3819 len. 17]: Pat and his sister would cheerfully give away their last penny to a friend in need .
Parsing [sent. 3820 len. 19]: It never occurred to them to show less readiness to accept when it came to their own turn .
Parsing [sent. 3821 len. 16]: Never was a surprise more happily planned ; never was a surprise more heartily enjoyed .
Parsing [sent. 3822 len. 4]: CHAPTER TWENTY TWO .
Parsing [sent. 3823 len. 4]: HE LOVED HER .
Parsing [sent. 3824 len. 8]: For the next week all went well .
Parsing [sent. 3825 len. 29]: Pat 's improvement , though slow , was so sure that a definite date was named on which he should be allowed to take his first few steps .
Parsing [sent. 3826 len. 46]: The doctor grimaced to Pixie as he gave this promise , as if to insinuate that the experiment would not be pleasant , but Pat was prepared -- in theory at least -- for anything and everything , if thereby he might regain his freedom .
Parsing [sent. 3827 len. 41]: Stephen Glynn paid daily visits to the flat , and , in addition , escorted Pixie to various `` sights '' of the great city , in which , to tell the honest truth , she showed but little interest .
Parsing [sent. 3828 len. 19]: Music was a passion with her , but of pictures she had no knowledge , and little appreciation .
Parsing [sent. 3829 len. 38]: The antiques in the National Gallery left her cold and bored , though she was full of interest in what seemed to her companion the most uninteresting men and women who were employed in copying the canvases .
Parsing [sent. 3830 len. 36]: When with the frankness of criticism which he had learned from herself he rallied her on this inconsistency , Pixie 's answer was characteristic -- `` One is dead , and the other 's alive .
Parsing [sent. 3831 len. 15]: The most uninteresting live person means more to me than a world of pictures .
Parsing [sent. 3832 len. 12]: That girl in the grey dress had tears in her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3833 len. 5]: ... Did you see ?
Parsing [sent. 3834 len. 5]: She looks so poor .
Parsing [sent. 3835 len. 14]: Perhaps she wants to sell her copy , and no one will buy !
Parsing [sent. 3836 len. 18]: There was a man talking to the fat woman next to her as we passed through before .
Parsing [sent. 3837 len. 8]: He was writing something in his pocket-book .
Parsing [sent. 3838 len. 17]: I believe he was buying the picture , and the poor grey girl felt so sad .
Parsing [sent. 3839 len. 17]: -- If Esmeralda were here , I 'd make her buy her copy , too . ''
Parsing [sent. 3840 len. 11]: `` It 's a very _ bad _ copy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3841 len. 3]: Stephen pronounced .
Parsing [sent. 3842 len. 17]: Then he looked down at the girl , and the transforming smile lit up his face .
Parsing [sent. 3843 len. 14]: `` All the same -- would I do instead of ` Esmeralda ' ?
Parsing [sent. 3844 len. 13]: I 'll buy it at once , if you wish it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3845 len. 12]: The grey eyes brightened , beamed , then clouded with uncertainty .
Parsing [sent. 3846 len. 3]: `` Really ?
Parsing [sent. 3847 len. 3]: Ought you ?
Parsing [sent. 3848 len. 4]: Are you sure ?
Parsing [sent. 3849 len. 11]: It may cost -- '' `` That 's my affair !
Parsing [sent. 3850 len. 5]: Leave that to me .
Parsing [sent. 3851 len. 9]: Would you like me to buy it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3852 len. 5]: `` I would ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3853 len. 44]: came back at once in the deepest tone of the eloquent Irish voice , and at that Stephen strode forward , his limp hardly observable on the wide , smooth floor , and came to a halt by the grey girl 's side .
Parsing [sent. 3854 len. 14]: Then followed what was to one spectator at least , a delightful scene .
Parsing [sent. 3855 len. 35]: The surprise on the grey girl 's face , the incredulity , the illimitable content , as the tall stranger made known his request , took out his pocket-book and handed her a card .
Parsing [sent. 3856 len. 26]: Emotional Pixie had the softness of tears in her own eyes as Stephen rejoined her , and they walked away together down the long room .
Parsing [sent. 3857 len. 15]: `` Well , '' he said smiling , `` on your head be it !
Parsing [sent. 3858 len. 21]: Now she 'll go on painting atrocities , and wasting good time , when she might be sweeping a floor !
Parsing [sent. 3859 len. 13]: It 's against my principles to encourage the desecration of art . ''
Parsing [sent. 3860 len. 9]: `` Why did you do it then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3861 len. 14]: Pixie demanded heartlessly , but next moment she smiled a beautiful smile . ''
Parsing [sent. 3862 len. 5]: _ I know _ !
Parsing [sent. 3863 len. 3]: Thank you !
Parsing [sent. 3864 len. 5]: Never mind about desecration .
Parsing [sent. 3865 len. 13]: Art can look after itself , and _ she _ ca n't !
Parsing [sent. 3866 len. 25]: And even if that particular picture is n't beautiful , you have given me another that is , the picture of her happy face !
Parsing [sent. 3867 len. 16]: I think , '' she concluded slowly , `` it 's going to help me .
Parsing [sent. 3868 len. 21]: -- It will be a contrast to turn , to , when I see -- _ that other _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3869 len. 66]: She sighed , as she invariably did , when referring to those moments on the Liverpool landing-stage , but she shook off the depression with a characteristic gesture , a defiant little shake not only of the head , but of the whole body , and cried briskly : `` Now let 's imagine what she does when she goes home with that cheque ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3870 len. 16]: At home in the little flat , music made part of every day 's programme .
Parsing [sent. 3871 len. 73]: Pixie , seated on the hearthrug , would sing Irish ballads in a voice of crooning sweetness , she and Pat would join in duets , occasionally Stephen was persuaded to join in a trio , and presently , as the performers became `` worked up '' to their task , they would recall one by one performances of bygone days , and perform them afresh for the delectation of their visitor .
Parsing [sent. 3872 len. 68]: Pixie whistled a bird-like accompaniment to Pat 's deep drone ; Pat , retiring bashfully beneath a sheet , whistled in his turn not only an air , but actually at the same time an accompaniment thereto , a soprano and contralto combination of sounds , so marvellous to hear that he was compelled to repeat the performance unmasked , before Stephen would believe in its authenticity .
Parsing [sent. 3873 len. 27]: Fired by the success of their efforts , combs were then produced , and , swathed in paper , turned into wind instruments of wondrous amenability .
Parsing [sent. 3874 len. 8]: Surprising effect of a duet upon combs !
Parsing [sent. 3875 len. 23]: Again , when towards the end of the week the repertoire gave out , and `` What shall we sing next ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3876 len. 27]: to fail of an answer , Pixie revived another old `` Knock '' accomplishment , which was neither more nor less than impromptu recitatives and choruses .
Parsing [sent. 3877 len. 21]: A bass recitative by Pat , on the theme -- '' _ And she went -- to find some mat-ches .
Parsing [sent. 3878 len. 11]: And there -- were -- none ... Tum-Tum _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3879 len. 29]: led the way to the liveliest of choruses , in which , goaded by outstretched fingers and flashing eyes , Stephen was forced to take his part . ''
Parsing [sent. 3880 len. 5]: _ There were none !
Parsing [sent. 3881 len. 7]: -- there were none _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3882 len. 7]: piped Pixie in the treble . ''
Parsing [sent. 3883 len. 11]: _ And she went -- and she went _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3884 len. 7]: rumbled Pat in the bass . ''
Parsing [sent. 3885 len. 3]: _ Matches !
Parsing [sent. 3886 len. 4]: Matches _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3887 len. 13]: fell from Stephen 's lips , on a repeated high tenor note .
Parsing [sent. 3888 len. 40]: Through ever-increasing intricacies and elaborations ran the chorus , until at last at a signal from the soprano it approached its close , the three singers proclaimed in unison that '' _ there -- were -- none _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3889 len. 12]: and promptly fell back in their seats in paroxysms of laughter .
Parsing [sent. 3890 len. 24]: In the course of the last twenty years , had he laughed as much as he had done within the last wonderful week ?
Parsing [sent. 3891 len. 30]: Stephen asked himself the question as he walked home the night after the singing of the `` Matches '' chorus , and there was little hesitation about the answer .
Parsing [sent. 3892 len. 17]: A week , ten days of unshadowed happiness and companionship , and then a cloud arose .
Parsing [sent. 3893 len. 16]: Pat was not _ well _ ; he grew worse ; he grew seriously ill .
Parsing [sent. 3894 len. 41]: The knee itself had done all that was expected of it , but the first attempt at walking , to which the poor fellow had looked forward as to a festival , proved in reality a painful and depressing experience .
Parsing [sent. 3895 len. 23]: Back in his bed , limp with pain and exhaustion , poor Pat realised his own weakness with a poignancy of disappointment .
Parsing [sent. 3896 len. 31]: He had expected to be able to walk at once , though not perhaps for any length of time , and these few stumbling steps had been a bitter revelation .
Parsing [sent. 3897 len. 16]: All these weeks of confinement and suffering , and now a long and dragging convalescence !
Parsing [sent. 3898 len. 9]: Pat 's heart swelled with bitterness and rebellion .
Parsing [sent. 3899 len. 55]: Despite the presence of Pixie and the constant visits of his friend , he was sick , sick to death of the one small room , and the monotonous indoor life , and as a young man successfully started in a young business , he longed with ardour to get back to his work .
Parsing [sent. 3900 len. 25]: The world looked very black to Pat O'Shaughnessy for the rest of that day , and atmospheric conditions did not help to cheer him .
Parsing [sent. 3901 len. 31]: It was raining , a slow , relentless rain , and in the air for days past had been a rawness , a chill which crept to the very bone .
Parsing [sent. 3902 len. 53]: Pixie drew the curtains over every chink , and hung a shawl over the end of Pat 's bed to still further screen him from draughts , but Pat was not in the mood to be coddled , and had that shawl whisked to the ground before one could say Jack Robinson .
Parsing [sent. 3903 len. 16]: He was curt and silent in his manner , and -- rare and significant sign !
Parsing [sent. 3904 len. 7]: -- partook of a fragmentary tea .
Parsing [sent. 3905 len. 34]: Nothing was right ; everything was wrong ; his patience was exhausted , and though he remained studiously polite to his friend , with his sister he unrestrainedly `` let himself go . ''
Parsing [sent. 3906 len. 7]: `` Do n't wriggle , Pixie !
Parsing [sent. 3907 len. 5]: ... Do n't shout !
Parsing [sent. 3908 len. 11]: -- Do n't tell us that story all over again .
Parsing [sent. 3909 len. 8]: ... Do n't lean against my bed .
Parsing [sent. 3910 len. 11]: ... Do n't sit between me and the fire ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3911 len. 36]: so on it went all through the afternoon , which as a rule was so cheery and peaceful , and if Pixie preserved a placid composure , Stephen Glynn was far from following her example .
Parsing [sent. 3912 len. 17]: He relapsed into a frigid silence , which added but another element to the general discomfort .
Parsing [sent. 3913 len. 38]: The final stroke came when Pixie lifted the despised shawl and attempted to wrap it round Pat 's shoulders , and was rudely repulsed , and told to mind her own business and not be a fool .
Parsing [sent. 3914 len. 22]: Then , with his air of _ grand seigneur _ , Stephen Glynn rose from his chair and made his adieux .
Parsing [sent. 3915 len. 32]: Cold as crystal was his manner as he extended his hand to the invalid on his bed , and Pixie followed him on to the little landing , apologetic and miserable .
Parsing [sent. 3916 len. 7]: `` You are going so soon ?
Parsing [sent. 3917 len. 14]: If you could stay and talk hard it might divert him from himself .
Parsing [sent. 3918 len. 7]: He _ needs _ diverting ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3919 len. 9]: `` I can not , '' Stephen declared .
Parsing [sent. 3920 len. 6]: `` It 's beyond me .
Parsing [sent. 3921 len. 18]: After all you have done -- after all your care , to speak to you so rudely !
Parsing [sent. 3922 len. 41]: -- '' He had passed through the front door of the flat , and Pixie stood within the threshold , her hand clasping the handle of the door , her face , tired and strained , raised to his own .
Parsing [sent. 3923 len. 6]: `` He did n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3924 len. 4]: she cried quickly .
Parsing [sent. 3925 len. 7]: `` Oh , he did n't .
Parsing [sent. 3926 len. 22]: It was n't Pat who spoke -- it was the pain , the pain , and the tiredness and the disappointment .
Parsing [sent. 3927 len. 6]: They force out the words .
Parsing [sent. 3928 len. 7]: Have n't you found that yourself ?
Parsing [sent. 3929 len. 8]: But his heart does n't mean them .
Parsing [sent. 3930 len. 12]: He 's all raw and hurting , and I worried him .
Parsing [sent. 3931 len. 8]: ... I should n't have done it !
Parsing [sent. 3932 len. 12]: You must be angry with me , not with Pat . ''
Parsing [sent. 3933 len. 9]: Stephen gave her a long , strange look .
Parsing [sent. 3934 len. 14]: `` I think I -- '' he began , and stopped short suddenly .
Parsing [sent. 3935 len. 4]: `` What ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3936 len. 10]: queried Pixie , and there was a long pause .
Parsing [sent. 3937 len. 8]: `` I -- do n't know ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3938 len. 18]: he answered dreamily then , and without a word of farewell turned away and descended the steps .
Parsing [sent. 3939 len. 5]: But he did know .
Parsing [sent. 3940 len. 27]: In the moment in which he had stood facing her while she pled her brother 's cause , the secret of his own heart was revealed .
Parsing [sent. 3941 len. 12]: Never under any circumstances could he be angry with Pixie O'Shaughnessy .
Parsing [sent. 3942 len. 36]: He loved her ; she was for him the one woman in the world ; with all the stored-up love of his empty life he loved her , and longed for her for his own .
Parsing [sent. 3943 len. 49]: That was the reason of his happiness during the past days , of the extraordinary new zest and interest in life which had filled his mind ; of his content in Pixie 's contentment , his anxiety for her anxiety , his furious resentment when she was abused .
Parsing [sent. 3944 len. 5]: And he loved her .
Parsing [sent. 3945 len. 39]: He loved her when she lapsed into her Irish brogue , and said `` Me dear '' ; he loved her when she assumed Frenchified airs , struck attitudes , and cried '' _ Ma foi _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3946 len. 62]: he loved her when she was sad , when she was glad , when she was youthful and mischievous , when she was serious and old , when she walked beside him in the street in the hat with the curling feather , when she sat on the hearthrug in her rose-hued dress crooning songs in her soft , sweet voice .
Parsing [sent. 3947 len. 39]: Always , and always , he loved her ; she had crept into his heart like a ray of sunshine lighting up unused rooms ; she had melted his coldness , as the south wind melts the frost .
Parsing [sent. 3948 len. 58]: He loved Pixie , and Pixie was going to marry Stanor Vaughan ... Stephen Glynn stepped shuddering into the clammy street , and away up on the fifth floor landing Pixie still stood motionless , holding the handle of that open door , repeating to herself dreamily that he would come back , he must come back !
Parsing [sent. 3949 len. 6]: He had never said good-bye !
Parsing [sent. 3950 len. 4]: CHAPTER TWENTY THREE .
Parsing [sent. 3951 len. 2]: COMPLICATIONS .
Parsing [sent. 3952 len. 16]: On the following afternoon Stephen Glynn failed to pay his daily visit to the flat .
Parsing [sent. 3953 len. 20]: After the revelation of the night before he had neither the strength nor the courage to encounter Pixie anew .
Parsing [sent. 3954 len. 35]: Little use to shut the stable door after the steed had flown , but he must at least have time to think , to face the future , and decide upon his own course .
Parsing [sent. 3955 len. 27]: And then at seven o'clock came the ring of the telephone , and Pixie 's voice speaking piteously in his ear -- `` Is it you ?
Parsing [sent. 3956 len. 3]: You yourself ?
Parsing [sent. 3957 len. 8]: Oh , why did n't you come ?
Parsing [sent. 3958 len. 6]: I was waiting for you .
Parsing [sent. 3959 len. 4]: I wanted you .
Parsing [sent. 3960 len. 4]: Pat 's ill !
Parsing [sent. 3961 len. 15]: He 's ill , and he wo n't let me send for the doctor .
Parsing [sent. 3962 len. 7]: Oh , do come round ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3963 len. 6]: `` I 'm coming ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3964 len. 9]: Stephen said , and hung up the receiver .
Parsing [sent. 3965 len. 9]: Pixie wanted him , that settled the matter .
Parsing [sent. 3966 len. 37]: In half an hour 's time his car stopped before the entrance to the flat , and the chauffeur was bidden to wait for further orders , while his master mounted the long flights of steps .
Parsing [sent. 3967 len. 24]: Pixie was seated beside the fire , and the glance of her eyes spoke of a warning which he was quick to understand .
Parsing [sent. 3968 len. 15]: Pat was not to suspect that his friend had been summoned on his behalf .
Parsing [sent. 3969 len. 19]: He turned towards the bed , and said lightly -- `` Sorry to be late , old man .
Parsing [sent. 3970 len. 4]: How goes it ?
Parsing [sent. 3971 len. 6]: Tried the walking again ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3972 len. 4]: `` This morning .
Parsing [sent. 3973 len. 2]: Yes .
Parsing [sent. 3974 len. 11]: But -- '' Pat shrugged wearily -- `` not since .
Parsing [sent. 3975 len. 11]: Got a head -- '' Stephen looked at him critically .
Parsing [sent. 3976 len. 17]: Bright eyes , flushed cheeks , shortened breath , all the danger signals to the fore .
Parsing [sent. 3977 len. 12]: `` Bit feverish , old man , that 's the trouble !
Parsing [sent. 3978 len. 6]: Exerting yourself too much perhaps .
Parsing [sent. 3979 len. 11]: Good thing I did n't come to tire you further .
Parsing [sent. 3980 len. 35]: Get that doctor fellow to give you something to cool you down , and give you a good night 's rest , and the little cherub will wake up bright as a button . ''
Parsing [sent. 3981 len. 5]: `` Sha n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3982 len. 3]: Pat cried .
Parsing [sent. 3983 len. 5]: `` No more doctors !
Parsing [sent. 3984 len. 7]: Sick of the sight of doctors !
Parsing [sent. 3985 len. 9]: What have doctors done for _ me _ ?
Parsing [sent. 3986 len. 12]: Chained here all these weeks , and worse at the end !
Parsing [sent. 3987 len. 7]: I can look after myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 3988 len. 9]: `` Taken your temperature by any chance ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3989 len. 6]: `` What 's the good ?
Parsing [sent. 3990 len. 10]: Do n't _ you _ start worrying , Glynn !
Parsing [sent. 3991 len. 9]: I 've had enough of it from Pixie .
Parsing [sent. 3992 len. 11]: I 'm not going to be worried with temperatures . ''
Parsing [sent. 3993 len. 10]: `` Do n't behave like a child , O'Shaughnessy .
Parsing [sent. 3994 len. 14]: No one wants to worry you with doctors if it can be helped .
Parsing [sent. 3995 len. 17]: I do n't wonder you are tired of them , but you ca n't run risks .
Parsing [sent. 3996 len. 23]: Take your temperature like a sensible fellow , and if it 's under a hundred , I 'll leave you in peace .
Parsing [sent. 3997 len. 11]: Otherwise I go downstairs this minute and telephone for Braithey .
Parsing [sent. 3998 len. 8]: Where 's the thermometer , Miss O'Shaughnessy ?
Parsing [sent. 3999 len. 8]: Now then , in with it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4000 len. 6]: Pat scowled , but submitted .
Parsing [sent. 4001 len. 21]: The glass tube was held between set lips , and a silence ensued which Stephen made no effort to break .
Parsing [sent. 4002 len. 29]: Pixie waited expectantly for him to join her , but he kept his position by the bed , without so much as turning his head in her direction .
Parsing [sent. 4003 len. 32]: And upon entering he had avoided her glance , had dropped her hand after the most perfunctory , clasp , and last night he had gone away without even saying good-night .
Parsing [sent. 4004 len. 27]: ... She had offended him : certainly she must have offended him , Pixie told herself , though _ how _ she was unable to think .
Parsing [sent. 4005 len. 15]: She stared into the fire , feeling tired , and sad , and discouraged .
Parsing [sent. 4006 len. 4]: `` Three minutes .
Parsing [sent. 4007 len. 6]: Yes , that 's enough .
Parsing [sent. 4008 len. 4]: Let me see !
Parsing [sent. 4009 len. 10]: I 'm getting quite clever with these puzzling things .
Parsing [sent. 4010 len. 3]: Ye-es ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4011 len. 20]: With a deft jerk of his wrist Stephen shook the thermometer , and returned it to it 's case .
Parsing [sent. 4012 len. 4]: `` Slightly up !
Parsing [sent. 4013 len. 7]: No escape for it , Pat .
Parsing [sent. 4014 len. 5]: Braithey must come ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4015 len. 7]: `` I wo n't see him .
Parsing [sent. 4016 len. 9]: I wo n't see him if he comes !
Parsing [sent. 4017 len. 10]: Look here , Glynn , it 's my affair !
Parsing [sent. 4018 len. 10]: Leave me alone , there 's a good fellow !
Parsing [sent. 4019 len. 14]: I can look after myself ... '' Stephen walked steadily to the door .
Parsing [sent. 4020 len. 10]: `` I 'll take good care you do n't .
Parsing [sent. 4021 len. 12]: That 's enough , Patrick , do n't waste your strength !
Parsing [sent. 4022 len. 20]: I 'm going downstairs to telephone , and if Braithey 's at home my car shall bring him round .
Parsing [sent. 4023 len. 6]: It 's waiting outside . ''
Parsing [sent. 4024 len. 25]: He disappeared , and the storm burst over Pixie 's head , but she bore it meekly , with a kind of stunned acceptance .
Parsing [sent. 4025 len. 7]: _ Everything _ seemed going wrong !
Parsing [sent. 4026 len. 14]: The sunny harmony of the last ten days had suddenly changed to gloom .
Parsing [sent. 4027 len. 12]: Pixie 's thoughts made a lightning review of those different days .
Parsing [sent. 4028 len. 9]: How perfectly , incredibly happy they had been !
Parsing [sent. 4029 len. 11]: Until this moment she had not fully realised their perfection .
Parsing [sent. 4030 len. 9]: `` Ah , now , Pat , stop !
Parsing [sent. 4031 len. 6]: Do n't worry , boy !
Parsing [sent. 4032 len. 6]: It 's not my head !
Parsing [sent. 4033 len. 24]: ... Wait till to-morrow and you 'll be better than ever , and think of the trouble it 'll give you to apologise .
Parsing [sent. 4034 len. 10]: ... It 's because we _ care _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4035 len. 15]: `` Wish to goodness you did n't then , '' cried the impenitent one .
Parsing [sent. 4036 len. 36]: However he might wish to apologise to-morrow , he was in no mood to begin to-night , but the pain in his head was so acute that by sheer exhaustion he was forced into silence .
Parsing [sent. 4037 len. 14]: Stephen did not return as had been expected after sending his telephone message .
Parsing [sent. 4038 len. 32]: He preferred , it appeared , to go on the car , and personally bring back the doctor , and half an hour later the two men entered the room together .
Parsing [sent. 4039 len. 16]: Then ensued the usual tapping and sounding , the enforced reiteration of `` Ah-ah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4040 len. 13]: the feeling of the pulse , the ignominious presentation of the tongue .
Parsing [sent. 4041 len. 32]: Pat went through the performance with the air of a martyr at the stake , sank back against the pillow when it was over , and hunched himself beneath the clothes .
Parsing [sent. 4042 len. 5]: `` That 's right !
Parsing [sent. 4043 len. 4]: That 's right !
Parsing [sent. 4044 len. 5]: Lie still and rest .
Parsing [sent. 4045 len. 9]: We 'll soon have you all right again .
Parsing [sent. 4046 len. 47]: Have a little nap if you can , while I give Miss O'Shaughnessy my instructions in the er -- er -- '' Doctor Braithey reminded himself in time that there _ was _ no second sitting-room , and concluded grandiloquently -- `` in the hall ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4047 len. 17]: They went out into the tiny passage , and Stephen and Pixie waited for the verdict .
Parsing [sent. 4048 len. 3]: `` Well !
Parsing [sent. 4049 len. 6]: The right lung is touched .
Parsing [sent. 4050 len. 6]: He has taken a chill .
Parsing [sent. 4051 len. 16]: Now we must see what we can do to prevent it from going farther . ''
Parsing [sent. 4052 len. 8]: He cast an inquiring glance at Pixie .
Parsing [sent. 4053 len. 8]: `` D'you know anything about poulticing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4054 len. 5]: `` Yes , everything !
Parsing [sent. 4055 len. 21]: I 've helped my sister with her children , and I brought the things ... '' `` That 's well !
Parsing [sent. 4056 len. 11]: Poultice him then , a fresh one every two hours .
Parsing [sent. 4057 len. 2]: Here !
Parsing [sent. 4058 len. 14]: You understand , in this position , '' he tapped himself in illustration .
Parsing [sent. 4059 len. 17]: `` I 'll send in medicines , and we 'll see how he is to-morrow morning .
Parsing [sent. 4060 len. 10]: If he is no better you 'll need help .
Parsing [sent. 4061 len. 10]: We 'll see about that when I call . ''
Parsing [sent. 4062 len. 25]: A few more words and he was gone , racing down the long stairway , while Stephen lingered behind with an air of uncertainty .
Parsing [sent. 4063 len. 11]: `` I -- suppose I can be of no use !
Parsing [sent. 4064 len. 14]: Pat ought to be quiet , and I 'm no hand at poulticing .
Parsing [sent. 4065 len. 9]: You are sure you can manage alone ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4066 len. 11]: Pixie nodded , struggling with a lump in her throat .
Parsing [sent. 4067 len. 8]: _ Why _ would n't he stay ?
Parsing [sent. 4068 len. 12]: Why did he so obviously not _ want _ to stay ?
Parsing [sent. 4069 len. 4]: `` I can .
Parsing [sent. 4070 len. 6]: It will be all right .
Parsing [sent. 4071 len. 6]: Moffatt will help me . ''
Parsing [sent. 4072 len. 12]: `` And to-morrow ... to-morrow you must get a nurse ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4073 len. 4]: `` No ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4074 len. 11]: cried Pixie with sudden energy , `` I will not .
Parsing [sent. 4075 len. 6]: I 'll have no stranger .
Parsing [sent. 4076 len. 6]: I 'll have Bridgie . ''
Parsing [sent. 4077 len. 24]: Her heart swelled at the sound of the beloved name ; she felt a helpless longing to cast herself on that faithful breast .
Parsing [sent. 4078 len. 5]: `` Bridgie must come .
Parsing [sent. 4079 len. 12]: There 's no room for a nurse in this tiny place .
Parsing [sent. 4080 len. 7]: Bridgie could share my room . ''
Parsing [sent. 4081 len. 11]: `` We 'll telegraph for her , '' Glynn said .
Parsing [sent. 4082 len. 22]: `` I will come round after breakfast , and if Pat is not quite himself , I 'll telegraph at once .
Parsing [sent. 4083 len. 9]: She could be with you by tea-time . ''
Parsing [sent. 4084 len. 6]: He was kind and considerate .
Parsing [sent. 4085 len. 17]: He was thoughtful for her comfort , ready to help by deed as well as word .
Parsing [sent. 4086 len. 34]: Pixie could not explain to herself wherein lay the want , but the reality of it gnawed at her heart , and darkened still further the hours of that long , anxious night .
Parsing [sent. 4087 len. 24]: Despite poultices , despite medicine , there was no doubt even to Pixie 's inexperienced eyes that Pat was worse the next morning .
Parsing [sent. 4088 len. 12]: His breathing was heavier , he was hotter , more restless .
Parsing [sent. 4089 len. 31]: Without waiting for Stephen she sent the little maid to telephone to the doctor , and through the same medium dispatched a summoning wire to Bridgie in her northern home .
Parsing [sent. 4090 len. 18]: The succeeding hours were filled with a nightmare-like struggle against odds which palpably increased with every hour .
Parsing [sent. 4091 len. 53]: Stephen came in and out , turned himself into a messenger to obtain everything that was needed , sent round a hamper of cooked dainties which would provide the small household for days to come , drove to the station to meet Bridgie and bring her to the flat , and oh !
Parsing [sent. 4092 len. 29]: the joy , the relief , the blessed consciousness of help , which came to nurse and patient alike at the sight of that sweet , fair face !
Parsing [sent. 4093 len. 71]: In one minute Bridgie had shed her hat and coat , in the second moment she was scorching herself by the fire , to remove all trace of chill before she approached the bedside , in the third she was sitting beside it -- calm , sweet , capable , with the air of having been there since the beginning of time , and intending to stay until the end .
Parsing [sent. 4094 len. 14]: For the next few days Pat had a sharp struggle for his life .
Parsing [sent. 4095 len. 22]: Pneumonia clutched him in its grip , and the sound of his painful breathing was heard all over the little flat .
Parsing [sent. 4096 len. 36]: There was a dreadful night when hope was well-nigh extinguished , when Stephen Glynn and the two sisters seemed to wrestle with the very angel of death , and Pat himself to face the end .
Parsing [sent. 4097 len. 7]: `` Shall I -- die ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4098 len. 15]: he gasped , and Bridgie 's answering smile seemed to hold an angelic sweetness .
Parsing [sent. 4099 len. 8]: `` I hope not , dear lad .
Parsing [sent. 4100 len. 22]: There 's so much work for you to do down here , but if you do -- it 's going home !
Parsing [sent. 4101 len. 8]: Mother 's there , and the Major !
Parsing [sent. 4102 len. 6]: They 'll welcome you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4103 len. 15]: But Pat was young , and the love of life was strong within him .
Parsing [sent. 4104 len. 20]: He had loved his parents , but still more at that moment he loved the thought of his work .
Parsing [sent. 4105 len. 12]: He fought for his life , and the fight was hard .
Parsing [sent. 4106 len. 49]: Into most lives there comes at times such a night as this ; a night of dark , illimitable hours , a night when the world and all its concerns withdraws itself to unmeasurable distance , and the division between life and the eternal grows thin and faint .
Parsing [sent. 4107 len. 10]: _ Would Pat live to see the morning _ ?
Parsing [sent. 4108 len. 13]: That was the question which to his sisters overwhelmed every other thought .
Parsing [sent. 4109 len. 16]: Afterwards , looking back , Pixie could recall certain incidents registered by the sub-conscious self .
Parsing [sent. 4110 len. 50]: Being gently forced into a chair ; being fed with cups of something hot and nourishing , placed suddenly in her hands by Stephen Glynn , always by Stephen , who seemed by his actions to regard her as a secondary invalid , to be tended with tenderest care .
Parsing [sent. 4111 len. 54]: Once , becoming suddenly conscious of his presence , as she stood in the kitchen preparing some necessary for the sick man , a growing fear burst into words , and she asked him pitifully -- _ how _ pitifully she herself could never know -- `` Was it _ my fault _ ?
Parsing [sent. 4112 len. 11]: Was there _ anything _ I could have done ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4113 len. 10]: `` No , dear , '' he said simply .
Parsing [sent. 4114 len. 8]: `` It is not your fault . ''
Parsing [sent. 4115 len. 11]: Pixie was certain that he had said `` dear . ''
Parsing [sent. 4116 len. 19]: The rhythm of it remained in her ears , that , and the deep gentleness of his tone .
Parsing [sent. 4117 len. 12]: He had been sorry for her , _ so _ sorry !
Parsing [sent. 4118 len. 14]: And he was so much older , and he was Stanor 's uncle .
Parsing [sent. 4119 len. 9]: Why should he not say `` dear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4120 len. 20]: Short and sharp was the attack , but by God 's mercy the crisis passed , and brought relief .
Parsing [sent. 4121 len. 22]: Weak as a child , but peaceful and quiet , Pat slept , and took his first steps back towards life .
Parsing [sent. 4122 len. 45]: At last the danger was over , and Pat 's natural vigour of constitution made the convalescence unusually quick , but even when he was comparatively well again , Bridgie refused in an altogether amazing and unprecedented manner to return to her beloved home .
Parsing [sent. 4123 len. 35]: She suggested not once , but many times in succession , that Pixie should return in her place to take the head of the household , but here Pat grew obstinate in his turn .
Parsing [sent. 4124 len. 2]: No !
Parsing [sent. 4125 len. 26]: Pixie had had all the dull work of nursing ; he was not going to allow her to return until she had had some fun .
Parsing [sent. 4126 len. 24]: And when he began to go out for walks , pray , who was going to accompany him , if Pixie went away ?
Parsing [sent. 4127 len. 17]: `` You 'd be off after her , the moment you saw me on my feet .
Parsing [sent. 4128 len. 11]: Do n't deny it , for I know better ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4129 len. 13]: Pat declared , and Bridgie blushed , and did not deny it .
Parsing [sent. 4130 len. 46]: Already she was pining for Dick and the children ; already counting the hours to her return , _ but _ ... Movement was evidently in the air ; perhaps it was caused by the bright , spring days which had replaced the former gloom .
Parsing [sent. 4131 len. 13]: Pat on his bed discussed a possible holiday before returning to work .
Parsing [sent. 4132 len. 10]: `` It might hurry things , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4133 len. 12]: `` What do you say , Pixie , seaside or country ?
Parsing [sent. 4134 len. 12]: Must go somewhere where there 's something to _ do _ !
Parsing [sent. 4135 len. 12]: Winter garden , concerts , bands , people to look at .
Parsing [sent. 4136 len. 6]: I want to be amused .
Parsing [sent. 4137 len. 11]: We 'll have a week somewhere , and blow expense .
Parsing [sent. 4138 len. 13]: You might come too , Glynn , and bring the car . ''
Parsing [sent. 4139 len. 23]: Glynn was sitting in his usual place beside the fire ; Bridgie was by the bed ; Pixie prone on the hearthrug .
Parsing [sent. 4140 len. 48]: During the last few days the invalid had been sufficiently strong to enjoy the society of his fellows , had even called upon Pixie to sing , and had apparently greatly enjoyed the hearing , though Bridgie seemed for once unappreciative , and had discouraged further efforts .
Parsing [sent. 4141 len. 33]: Now his mind had turned on to holidays , and he had made this direct appeal to Stephen , which seemed to find scant favour from two out of the three hearers .
Parsing [sent. 4142 len. 18]: Bridgie frowned , and stared at the carpet ; Stephen 's pale face showed a discomfited flush .
Parsing [sent. 4143 len. 9]: `` You shall have the car with pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 4144 len. 31]: It shall take you wherever you decide to go , and be at your service for as long as you please , but for myself , I must get home .
Parsing [sent. 4145 len. 15]: I -- I am not usually in town for so long at a time .
Parsing [sent. 4146 len. 12]: There are several things waiting attention which should not be delayed .
Parsing [sent. 4147 len. 26]: I must get back ... '' There was a dead silence , while each one of the three hearers realised the futility of the excuse .
Parsing [sent. 4148 len. 44]: Stephen 's estate was in the hands of a capable agent : an extra week 's absence could make little difference ; moreover , previous statements had made it plain that he had originally intended to stay for some considerable time in town .
Parsing [sent. 4149 len. 46]: Plain , therefore , as print , and impossible to misunderstand was the fact that he did not _ want _ to accompany his friends on their holiday ; that in addition he did not for the moment desire more of their company in town .
Parsing [sent. 4150 len. 19]: Bridgie raised her head : she was smiling , a bright , unaffected , _ relieved-looking _ smile .
Parsing [sent. 4151 len. 13]: `` There 's no end to the work on a big estate .
Parsing [sent. 4152 len. 31]: The Major -- my father -- used to say that every man was his own best bailiff , though he made a fine muddle of it himself , poor darling !
Parsing [sent. 4153 len. 8]: But my brother Jack agrees with him .
Parsing [sent. 4154 len. 17]: He 's educated Miles to look after the Irish property , and so does Geoffrey Hilliard .
Parsing [sent. 4155 len. 41]: ... It 's true he is away half his time -- '' At the best of times Bridgie was scarcely a special pleader , and to-day she seemed no sooner to make a statement than she contradicted it straight away .
Parsing [sent. 4156 len. 9]: She mumbled vaguely , and relapsed into silence .
Parsing [sent. 4157 len. 10]: `` Of course we wo n't take your car .
Parsing [sent. 4158 len. 10]: You will need it for your business excursions ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4159 len. 4]: Pat said icily .
Parsing [sent. 4160 len. 18]: `` We are very much indebted to you for letting us have the use of it here .
Parsing [sent. 4161 len. 14]: It 's been of great service , has n't it , Pixie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4162 len. 4]: `` It has !
Parsing [sent. 4163 len. 12]: I do n't know what we 'd have done without it .
Parsing [sent. 4164 len. 11]: We _ are _ grateful , '' agreed Pixie warmly .
Parsing [sent. 4165 len. 25]: Her voice out of all the four was the only one which rang true ; her eyes smiled across the room with unembarrassed friendliness .
Parsing [sent. 4166 len. 12]: Nevertheless Bridgie , looking on , felt a cramp of pain .
Parsing [sent. 4167 len. 9]: How much older Pixie had grown in appearance !
Parsing [sent. 4168 len. 24]: The lines of strain and repression over which she had sighed more than once before now had surely deepened during the last weeks !
Parsing [sent. 4169 len. 41]: Anxiety , no doubt , the strain of nursing -- Bridgie comforted herself as best she might , but no explanation could take away the pang which the mother heart feels at the sight of pain on a young face !
Parsing [sent. 4170 len. 17]: `` Come , Pixie , '' she said , rising , `` we 'll make tea !
Parsing [sent. 4171 len. 18]: I promised Pat potato cakes as soon as the doctor allowed them , and that 's to-day .
Parsing [sent. 4172 len. 6]: We 'll have a feast !
Parsing [sent. 4173 len. 20]: -- '' `` Leave them to themselves , '' she said confidingly to Pixie when the kitchen was reached .
Parsing [sent. 4174 len. 9]: `` They 'll shake down better without us .
Parsing [sent. 4175 len. 23]: Pat 's fractious ; he always was from a child when he was crossed , but the potato cakes will soothe him .
Parsing [sent. 4176 len. 7]: I 'm sorry for Mr Glynn .
Parsing [sent. 4177 len. 15]: Really , you know , dear , Pat 's _ exacting _ ! '' ''
Parsing [sent. 4178 len. 5]: ` Deed he is .
Parsing [sent. 4179 len. 11]: It 's no wonder he is tired of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4180 len. 13]: Bridgie needed no explanation as to the significance of that second he .
Parsing [sent. 4181 len. 19]: `` He 's been fussing about us for weeks , and now he 'll go home and rest .
Parsing [sent. 4182 len. 6]: It 's a good thing !
Parsing [sent. 4183 len. 11]: Will I mash the potatoes for you , Bridgie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4184 len. 17]: `` Thank you , darling , '' said Bridgie humbly , but her face remained troubled .
Parsing [sent. 4185 len. 18]: Once more , and with all her heart , she wished that Pixie were safe at home .
Parsing [sent. 4186 len. 30]: The rumble of men 's voices could be heard from the kitchen -- an amicable rumble it appeared to be , though with mysterious breaks from time to time .
Parsing [sent. 4187 len. 27]: Bridgie bustled in , tea-tray in hand , in the middle of one of these breaks , and surprised a look of sadness on each face .
Parsing [sent. 4188 len. 43]: She decided that Stephen was to depart forthwith , but such was not the case , since over tea he alluded to an old promise to take Pixie to the Temple , and included Bridgie in an invitation for the following Sunday .
Parsing [sent. 4189 len. 23]: `` And then I must be off -- on Monday -- or -- or perhaps on Tuesday , '' he said vaguely .
Parsing [sent. 4190 len. 7]: `` One day next week . ''
Parsing [sent. 4191 len. 20]: `` I leave on Monday too , '' said Bridgie , and ate her potato cake with recovered zest .
Parsing [sent. 4192 len. 4]: CHAPTER TWENTY FOUR .
Parsing [sent. 4193 len. 4]: HE LOVES YOU .
Parsing [sent. 4194 len. 42]: That evening Pat showed early signs of fatigue , and requested Bridgie to settle him for the night , bidding the while so marked a farewell to Pixie that she had no alternative but to retire forthwith to her own room .
Parsing [sent. 4195 len. 29]: Truth to tell she was not sorry , for sleep had been an uncertain quantity of late , and the prospect of a long undisturbed night was agreeable .
Parsing [sent. 4196 len. 54]: She dallied over her undressing , and when Bridgie joined her half an hour later , sat perched upon the bed , dressing-gowned , her hands clasped round her knees , watching with admiring eyes the picture of her sweet-faced sister seated before the dressing-table engaged in brushing out her long fair hair .
Parsing [sent. 4197 len. 12]: `` You 've a fine head of hair , me dear !
Parsing [sent. 4198 len. 5]: It 's wearing well .
Parsing [sent. 4199 len. 35]: ... D'you remember the day you and Esmeralda had the trick played on you about going to bed , and sat up half the night brushing and combing to tire out the other ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4200 len. 27]: `` I do so , '' answered Bridgie , but it was but a faint smile which she gave to the memory of that youthful joke .
Parsing [sent. 4201 len. 31]: She parted her hair with a sweep of the brush , and gazing at her sister between the long gold strands said suddenly , and earnestly , `` Pixie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4202 len. 5]: `` Me dear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4203 len. 9]: `` There 's something I want to say .
Parsing [sent. 4204 len. 8]: ... To-morrow Mr Glynn will be here .
Parsing [sent. 4205 len. 10]: Pat 's asked him to come back after church .
Parsing [sent. 4206 len. 15]: He is going away on Monday , so it will be the last time .
Parsing [sent. 4207 len. 7]: Be _ careful _ , darling !
Parsing [sent. 4208 len. 6]: Think what you 're about .
Parsing [sent. 4209 len. 18]: You do n't want to be unkind -- '' Pixie stared -- a stunned , incredulous stare .
Parsing [sent. 4210 len. 3]: `` Unkind !
Parsing [sent. 4211 len. 5]: To _ him _ !
Parsing [sent. 4212 len. 4]: Are you raving ?
Parsing [sent. 4213 len. 9]: What am I to be careful about ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4214 len. 10]: `` Oh -- oh -- _ everything _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4215 len. 10]: Bridgie 's breath came in a gasp of helplessness .
Parsing [sent. 4216 len. 26]: It had been difficult to speak , but a sense of duty had driven her on , and now it was too late to stop .
Parsing [sent. 4217 len. 12]: `` Do n't -- do n't talk to him so much .
Parsing [sent. 4218 len. 7]: Do n't look at him . ''
Parsing [sent. 4219 len. 17]: -LRB- Did Pixie realise how instinctively her eyes sought Stephen 's for sympathy and appreciation ? -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 4220 len. 11]: `` Do n't sit by the fire and sing . ''
Parsing [sent. 4221 len. 13]: A flush spread over Pixie 's cheek ; her eyes widened . ''
Parsing [sent. 4222 len. 4]: _ Why _ ?
Parsing [sent. 4223 len. 6]: Does n't he like it ?
Parsing [sent. 4224 len. 8]: Is n't it _ nice _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4225 len. 8]: `` Oh-oh , _ Pixie _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4226 len. 4]: cried Bridgie helplessly .
Parsing [sent. 4227 len. 23]: A vision rose before her of a little figure in a rose-coloured gown , of the firelight playing on the upturned face .
Parsing [sent. 4228 len. 15]: She heard again , the deep crooning notes which filled the room with sweetness .
Parsing [sent. 4229 len. 32]: To herself , a sister , the picture was full of charm -- what must it be to a lonely man , in love for the first time in thirty-five years ?
Parsing [sent. 4230 len. 41]: She rose from her chair and came across to the bed : face to face , within the stretch of an arm , the sisters waited in silence , while the clock on the mantelpiece ticked out a long minute .
Parsing [sent. 4231 len. 17]: `` Pixie , '' whispered Bridgie breathlessly , '' _ do n't you know _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4232 len. 4]: `` What ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4233 len. 14]: `` Do n't you know , Pixie , that he loves you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4234 len. 6]: `` Who loves me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4235 len. 4]: `` Stephen Glynn .
Parsing [sent. 4236 len. 10]: Oh , Pixie , did n't you see ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4237 len. 22]: The colour faded from Pixie 's face ; she threw out her hand as if to ward off a threatened danger .
Parsing [sent. 4238 len. 21]: There was a note almost of anger in her reply -- `` It 's not true ; it 's not !
Parsing [sent. 4239 len. 6]: It could n't be true .
Parsing [sent. 4240 len. 6]: ... He care for me !
Parsing [sent. 4241 len. 3]: For Me !
Parsing [sent. 4242 len. 6]: You 're mad , Bridgie !
Parsing [sent. 4243 len. 4]: You 're dreaming !
Parsing [sent. 4244 len. 15]: There 's nothing ... '' `` Oh , Pixie , there _ is _ !
Parsing [sent. 4245 len. 7]: I saw it the first evening .
Parsing [sent. 4246 len. 12]: I 'd have spoken before , but Pat was so ill .
Parsing [sent. 4247 len. 8]: Then I tried -- you know how .
Parsing [sent. 4248 len. 3]: I tried !
Parsing [sent. 4249 len. 6]: -- to send you away .
Parsing [sent. 4250 len. 17]: I knew that every day was making it harder for him , more difficult to forget .
Parsing [sent. 4251 len. 9]: I was so _ sorry _ for him !
Parsing [sent. 4252 len. 12]: Pixie , he is thirty-five , and has suffered so much .
Parsing [sent. 4253 len. 23]: It 's hard on a man when he gets to that age , and -- '' '' _ Do n't _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4254 len. 4]: cried Pixie sharply .
Parsing [sent. 4255 len. 16]: She thrust out her hand once more , and cowered as if from a blow .
Parsing [sent. 4256 len. 9]: `` Bridgie , I ca n't bear it !
Parsing [sent. 4257 len. 7]: Do n't torture me , Bridgie .
Parsing [sent. 4258 len. 8]: ... It _ is n't _ true !
Parsing [sent. 4259 len. 6]: You are making it up .
Parsing [sent. 4260 len. 21]: Ah , Bridgie , it 's because you love me yourself that you think every one must do the same !
Parsing [sent. 4261 len. 19]: He 's -- Stanor 's uncle ... Pat 's friend -- he was just kind like other friends .
Parsing [sent. 4262 len. 12]: ... He never said a word ... looked a look . ''
Parsing [sent. 4263 len. 37]: Suddenly , unexpectedly the blood flared in her face as memory took her back to the hour when she stood at the door of the flat and watched Stephen 's abrupt descent down the flagged stairway .
Parsing [sent. 4264 len. 9]: `` Oh , Bridgie , are ye sure ?
Parsing [sent. 4265 len. 6]: Are ye _ sure _ ?
Parsing [sent. 4266 len. 5]: How are ye sure ?
Parsing [sent. 4267 len. 8]: It 's so easy to be deceived !
Parsing [sent. 4268 len. 17]: Bridgie , you 've no _ right _ to say it if you are not sure .
Parsing [sent. 4269 len. 6]: I do n't believe you !
Parsing [sent. 4270 len. 18]: Nothing could make me believe unless he said -- '' `` Pixie , he has said ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4271 len. 21]: The words fell from Bridgie 's lips as though in opposition to her judgment she were compelled to speak them .
Parsing [sent. 4272 len. 44]: `` Pat was hurt that he was going ; he reproached him to-night after we left ; they had a discussion about it , and he said Stephen Glynn said that he dare n't stay , he dare n't see more of you .
Parsing [sent. 4273 len. 17]: ... Pat does not think he meant to say it , it just -- said itself !
Parsing [sent. 4274 len. 27]: And afterwards he set his lips , and put on his haughty air , and turned the conversation , and Pat dared not say another word .
Parsing [sent. 4275 len. 6]: But he had said enough .
Parsing [sent. 4276 len. 4]: ... His face !
Parsing [sent. 4277 len. 4]: ... his voice !
Parsing [sent. 4278 len. 11]: ... Pat did not believe he could feel so much .
Parsing [sent. 4279 len. 7]: He cares desperately , Pixie . ''
Parsing [sent. 4280 len. 20]: Pixie sat motionless -- so silent , so motionless , that not a breath seemed to stir her being .
Parsing [sent. 4281 len. 29]: Bridgie waited , her face full of motherly tenderness , but the silence was so long , so intense , that by degrees the tenderness changed into anxiety .
Parsing [sent. 4282 len. 45]: It was unlike emotional Pixie to face any crisis of life in silence ; the necessity to express herself had ever been her leading characteristic , so that lack of expression was of all things the most startling , in her sister 's estimation .
Parsing [sent. 4283 len. 20]: She stretched out her hand , and laid it on the bowed shoulder with a firm , strengthening touch .
Parsing [sent. 4284 len. 3]: `` Pixie !
Parsing [sent. 4285 len. 3]: Look up !
Parsing [sent. 4286 len. 4]: Speak to me !
Parsing [sent. 4287 len. 8]: What are you thinking , dear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4288 len. 21]: Pixie raised her face , a set face , which to the watching eyes seemed apiece with the former silence .
Parsing [sent. 4289 len. 21]: There seemed _ no _ expression on it ; it was a lifeless mask which had been swept of expression .
Parsing [sent. 4290 len. 31]: As the blank eyes looked into her own and the lips mechanically moved , Bridgie had the sensation of facing a stranger in the place of the beloved little sister .
Parsing [sent. 4291 len. 6]: `` I am honoured ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4292 len. 4]: said Pixie flatly .
Parsing [sent. 4293 len. 6]: `` I am honoured ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4294 len. 39]: She rose slowly from the bed , moving stiffly as though the mere physical effort were a strain , and passing by Bridgie 's inviting arms walked over to the dressing-table and began to loosen her own hair .
Parsing [sent. 4295 len. 7]: `` You have finished , Bridgie ?
Parsing [sent. 4296 len. 8]: I 'm not in your way ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4297 len. 13]: she asked quietly , and Bridgie faltered a weak `` No ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4298 len. 11]: and felt that the world was coming to an end .
Parsing [sent. 4299 len. 29]: Pixie silent ; Pixie dignified ; Pixie quietly but unmistakably holding her sister and guardian at arm 's length , this was an experience petrifying in its unexpectedness !
Parsing [sent. 4300 len. 25]: She had not spoken on the impulse of a moment ; for days past she had been nerving herself to open Pixie 's eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4301 len. 30]: At the bottom of her heart had lain a dawning hope that such an opening might not be in vain , for Pixie had never really loved Stanor Vaughan .
Parsing [sent. 4302 len. 54]: At the time of their engagement she had not even understood what love meant ; during the years of their separation there had been nothing but an occasional letter to preserve his image in her mind , and when the allotted two years were over , Stanor himself had voluntarily extended his exile .
Parsing [sent. 4303 len. 17]: Bridgie set her lips as she recalled a fact so hurtful to her sister 's dignity .
Parsing [sent. 4304 len. 15]: She heard again Pat 's voice , echoing the sentiments of her own heart .
Parsing [sent. 4305 len. 6]: `` Tell her , Bridgie !
Parsing [sent. 4306 len. 5]: She ought to know .
Parsing [sent. 4307 len. 10]: He 's worth a thousand of that other fellow .
Parsing [sent. 4308 len. 13]: Do n't let her throw away the substance for the shadow . ''
Parsing [sent. 4309 len. 28]: So she had spoken , and a new Pixie -- a Pixie she had never even imagined in dreams -- had listened , and made her reply .
Parsing [sent. 4310 len. 6]: `` I am honoured ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4311 len. 18]: she had said , and straightway , sweetly , courteously , irrevocably , had closed the subject .
Parsing [sent. 4312 len. 19]: Bridgie bent her head and plaited her hair in the two long ropes which made her nightly coiffure .
Parsing [sent. 4313 len. 36]: She was thankful of the employment , thankful of an excuse to hide her face ; she listened to the ticking of the clock upon the mantelpiece and asked herself what she should do next .
Parsing [sent. 4314 len. 31]: The incredible had come to pass , and she , Bridgie , sister , guardian , married woman , mother of a family , was nervous in Pixie 's presence !
Parsing [sent. 4315 len. 27]: Not for any bribe that could have been offered would she have ventured to hint at that hope which she and Pat had shared in common .
Parsing [sent. 4316 len. 14]: Suddenly through the little flat rang the sound of the postman 's knock .
Parsing [sent. 4317 len. 30]: The last of the many deliveries of the day had arrived , and Bridgie peeping out of the door spied a couple of white envelopes prone on the mat .
Parsing [sent. 4318 len. 24]: She crept out to get them , thankful of the diversion , and was overjoyed to behold on one her husband 's writing .
Parsing [sent. 4319 len. 18]: `` One for me , Pixie , and one for you -- an enclosure forwarded from home .
Parsing [sent. 4320 len. 8]: I 'm so glad to get mine .
Parsing [sent. 4321 len. 62]: It 's nice for the postmen in London to have Sundays free , but we country people _ do _ miss letters , '' she said glibly , as she handed Pixie her share of the spoil , and seated herself in the one comfortable chair which the room afforded , to enjoy to the full the welcome message from home .
Parsing [sent. 4322 len. 68]: Perhaps Dick had divined the double anxiety which was burdening his wife , perhaps he realised how long she would feel a Sunday without news , perhaps out of his own loneliness had arisen a need for words -- in any case , that special letter was the longest and , to Bridgie 's heart , the dearest which she had received since her departure from home .
Parsing [sent. 4323 len. 65]: He told her of the children , and of their latest sayings ; he told her of himself and his work ; he comforted her , where she needed comfort , cheered her , where she needed cheer , called her by the sweet love names which she most loved to hear , and held before her eyes the prospect of a swift return .
Parsing [sent. 4324 len. 37]: And Bridgie reading that letter thanked God for the thousandth time , because on her -- undeserving -- had been bestowed the greatest gift which a woman can receive -- the gift of a faithful love !
Parsing [sent. 4325 len. 60]: Ten minutes had passed before she had read and re-read her precious letter , but when she turned her head it was to find Pixie standing in the same position as that in which she had seen her last , gazing down upon a sheet of paper on which a few short lines were written in a masculine writing .
Parsing [sent. 4326 len. 25]: At Bridgie 's movement she raised her head , and spoke in a curiously low , level voice -- `` It is from Stanor .
Parsing [sent. 4327 len. 6]: He has sailed for home .
Parsing [sent. 4328 len. 22]: Honor Ward and a party of friends were crossing , and he decided at the last moment to come with them .
Parsing [sent. 4329 len. 9]: We shall see him on Thursday next . ''
Parsing [sent. 4330 len. 4]: CHAPTER TWENTY FIVE .
Parsing [sent. 4331 len. 4]: STANOR COMES BACK .
Parsing [sent. 4332 len. 5]: It was Thursday morning .
Parsing [sent. 4333 len. 25]: With the doctor 's permission Pat 's bed had been carried back to the minute apartment which was grandiloquently termed a `` dressing-room . ''
Parsing [sent. 4334 len. 45]: A sofa took its place in the dining-room , and with the aid of a stick he could walk from one refuge to another , and enjoy what -- after the confinement of the past months -- appeared quite an exciting variety of scene .
Parsing [sent. 4335 len. 41]: Bridgie Victor was still a joint occupant of the `` best '' bedroom , for since Pat refused to part with Pixie it was plainly the elder sister 's duty to stay on over the important meeting with Stanor Vaughan .
Parsing [sent. 4336 len. 17]: The modern girl scoffs at the idea of chaperonage , but the O'Shaughnessys were not modern .
Parsing [sent. 4337 len. 21]: Bridgie felt the impulse to protect , and Pixie 's piteous '' _ Stay _ with me , Bridgie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4338 len. 11]: marked the one moment of weakness which she had shown .
Parsing [sent. 4339 len. 34]: So Bridgie remained in London , comforted by the knowledge that her husband was well and her children in good hands , and seldom in her life had five days passed so slowly .
Parsing [sent. 4340 len. 46]: Sunday itself had seemed a week long , the atmosphere strained and unreal , each member of the little party talking to pass the time , uttering platitudes , and discussing every imaginable subject under the sun but just the one which filled every mind .
Parsing [sent. 4341 len. 37]: No need to bid Pixie to be discreet , to warn her not to sing , nor glance too frequently in a certain direction -- a talking automaton could not have shown less sign of feeling .
Parsing [sent. 4342 len. 61]: As for Stephen Glynn , the news of his nephew 's sudden return obviously came to him as a shock , but as a man of the world he was an adept in hiding his feelings , and though he curtailed his visit , so long as he was in the flat he exerted himself to preserve an ordinary demeanour .
Parsing [sent. 4343 len. 10]: His adieux also were of the most commonplace description .
Parsing [sent. 4344 len. 10]: `` It 's hardly worth while to say good-bye .
Parsing [sent. 4345 len. 11]: We shall meet , we shall certainly meet before long .
Parsing [sent. 4346 len. 37]: I will write to welcome Stanor , and you -- '' he held Pixie 's hand and looked down at her with an inquiring glance -- `` you will let me hear your -- news ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4347 len. 9]: `` I will , '' answered Pixie simply .
Parsing [sent. 4348 len. 32]: Bridgie would have given a fortune to be able to see what was in `` the child 's '' head at that moment , to know what she was really thinking .
Parsing [sent. 4349 len. 25]: The sisters walked together to the door , Pat , on his stick , bringing up the rear , and stood watching Stephen descend .
Parsing [sent. 4350 len. 35]: Once and again he looked up , smiled , and waved his hand , and as he did so his eyes had the same piteous glance which Pixie had noticed on their first meeting .
Parsing [sent. 4351 len. 26]: The expression of those upturned eyes hurt all three onlookers in different degrees , and sent them back to their little room with downcast looks .
Parsing [sent. 4352 len. 13]: `` Now he 'll bury himself in the country again and mope !
Parsing [sent. 4353 len. 12]: It 's been the making of him being here in town .
Parsing [sent. 4354 len. 10]: Goodness knows what will happen to him now ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4355 len. 24]: said Pat , dropping on to the couch with an impatient sigh , and Bridgie murmured softly -- `` The dear , man !
Parsing [sent. 4356 len. 4]: The dear man !
Parsing [sent. 4357 len. 9]: So hard for , him to be alone .
Parsing [sent. 4358 len. 9]: But you need n't be anxious , Pat .
Parsing [sent. 4359 len. 7]: He 's so _ good _ .
Parsing [sent. 4360 len. 6]: He 'll be looked after !
Parsing [sent. 4361 len. 22]: ... Do n't you think , now , his eyes are the least thing in the world like Dick 's ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4362 len. 7]: `` Not the least least ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4363 len. 13]: snapped Pixie , and that was her one contribution to the conversation .
Parsing [sent. 4364 len. 24]: And now it was Thursday -- Thursday afternoon , within an hour , of the time fixed by telegram for Stanor 's arrival .
Parsing [sent. 4365 len. 24]: Pat had elected to stay in bed , in consequence of what he called headache and his sisters translated as `` sulks . ''
Parsing [sent. 4366 len. 9]: He did n't want to see the fellow .
Parsing [sent. 4367 len. 8]: ... What was the fellow to him ?
Parsing [sent. 4368 len. 23]: Did n't know how the fellow had the face to turn up at all , after dawdling away an extra six months .
Parsing [sent. 4369 len. 24]: Hoped to goodness the fellow would make short work of it and be off , as he wanted to get up for dinner .
Parsing [sent. 4370 len. 24]: In her heart Bridgie agreed with each sentiment in turn , but she felt it her duty to be stern and bracing . ''
Parsing [sent. 4371 len. 10]: ` Deed , and I hope so , too !
Parsing [sent. 4372 len. 16]: Else I shall have to sit here , and you 're not the best company .
Parsing [sent. 4373 len. 26]: I 'm your guest , me dear -- if you have n't the heart to be civil ye might at least have the good manners !
Parsing [sent. 4374 len. 33]: My little Jack would never dr-eam -- '' `` Little prig he must be , then , '' mumbled Pat ; but the reproof went home , and he grumbled no more .
Parsing [sent. 4375 len. 59]: Just before the clock struck the hour Bridgie paid a flying visit to the little sitting-room to see that the tea-table was set , the kettle on the hob , the dish of hot scones on the brass stand in the fender , and everything ready to hand , so that no one need enter unless specially summoned .
Parsing [sent. 4376 len. 17]: She found Pixie standing gazing into the fire , and started with surprise and disappointment . ''
Parsing [sent. 4377 len. 7]: _ Pixie _ , your dress !
Parsing [sent. 4378 len. 5]: That dull old thing ?
Parsing [sent. 4379 len. 5]: Why not your pink ?
Parsing [sent. 4380 len. 7]: Me dear , you 've time .
Parsing [sent. 4381 len. 6]: ... There 's still time .
Parsing [sent. 4382 len. 8]: ... Run off and change it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4383 len. 6]: But Pixie shook her head .
Parsing [sent. 4384 len. 10]: `` Bridgie , _ do n't fuss _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4385 len. 20]: she said , and there was a note in her voice which checked the words on Bridgie 's lips .
Parsing [sent. 4386 len. 16]: She literally dared not say any more , but her heart was heavy with disappointment .
Parsing [sent. 4387 len. 76]: She had been so anxious that Pixie should look her best for this important interview , had been so complacently satisfied that the rose-coloured gown was as becoming as it could be , and now the aggravating , mysterious little thing had deliberately left it hanging in the wardrobe , and put on instead an old brown dress which had been a failure at the beginning , and was now well advanced in middle age .
Parsing [sent. 4388 len. 72]: One result of Pixie 's sojourn in Paris had been an acquired faculty for making the best of herself : she put on her clothes with care , she wore them `` with an air , '' she dressed her hair with neat precision , and then with a finger and thumb gave a tweak here , a pat there , which imparted to the final effect something piquant and attractive .
Parsing [sent. 4389 len. 38]: To-day it appeared as if that transforming touch had been forgotten , and Bridgie , looking on , felt that pang of distress which all motherly hearts experience when their nurslings show otherwise than at their best .
Parsing [sent. 4390 len. 11]: `` Are you not going to sit with Pat ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4391 len. 31]: inquired Pixie at the end of a pregnant silence , and at that very obvious hint Bridgie retired perforce , repeating gallantly to herself , `` Looks do n't matter !
Parsing [sent. 4392 len. 5]: Looks do n't matter !
Parsing [sent. 4393 len. 8]: They do n't matter a bit ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4394 len. 19]: and believing just as much of what she said as would any other young woman of her age .
Parsing [sent. 4395 len. 16]: Another ten minutes and the sound of the electric bell rang sharply round the flat .
Parsing [sent. 4396 len. 23]: The door opened and shut , and Moffatt , entering the sitting-room in advance , announced loudly -- `` Mr Vaughan ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4397 len. 11]: A tall , fair man entered with a rapid step .
Parsing [sent. 4398 len. 13]: Pixie looked at him , and felt a consciousness of unutterable strangeness .
Parsing [sent. 4399 len. 18]: This was not the man from whom she had parted on the deck of that ocean-bound steamer !
Parsing [sent. 4400 len. 18]: This man was older , broader ; the once lazy , laughter-loving eyes were keen and shrewd .
Parsing [sent. 4401 len. 15]: His shoulders also were padded into the exaggerated square , characteristic of American tailors .
Parsing [sent. 4402 len. 6]: `` Well -- Pixie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4403 len. 6]: Even the voice was strange .
Parsing [sent. 4404 len. 13]: It had absorbed the American accent , the American clip and drawl .
Parsing [sent. 4405 len. 14]: Pixie had the consciousness of struggling with stiffened features which refused to smile .
Parsing [sent. 4406 len. 6]: `` Well -- Stanor ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4407 len. 20]: He took her hand and held it in his , the while he stared down at her upturned face .
Parsing [sent. 4408 len. 15]: His brows contracted , as though what he saw was more painful than pleasant .
Parsing [sent. 4409 len. 15]: `` I guess you 've been having a bad time , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4410 len. 13]: `` I was sorry to hear your brother 's been sick . ''
Parsing [sent. 4411 len. 16]: `` He is better now , '' Pixie said , and gently withdrew her hand .
Parsing [sent. 4412 len. 16]: _ Two and a half years ' waiting , and this was the meeting _ !
Parsing [sent. 4413 len. 27]: She drew herself up , with the little air of dignity which she knew so well how to assume , and waved him to a seat .
Parsing [sent. 4414 len. 7]: `` Wo n't you sit down ?
Parsing [sent. 4415 len. 7]: I will give you some tea .
Parsing [sent. 4416 len. 11]: It is all ready , and the kettle is boiling .
Parsing [sent. 4417 len. 8]: When did you arrive in town ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4418 len. 5]: `` Two hours ago .
Parsing [sent. 4419 len. 17]: I went straight to my hotel to write some letters , and then came along here .
Parsing [sent. 4420 len. 8]: ... This is your brother 's apartment ?
Parsing [sent. 4421 len. 4]: Nice little place !
Parsing [sent. 4422 len. 9]: It 's good news that he is better !
Parsing [sent. 4423 len. 12]: Hard luck on him to be bowled over like that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4424 len. 26]: The accent , the intonation carried Pixie 's thoughts irresistibly towards another speaker , whose memory war associated with her own first meeting with Stanor .
Parsing [sent. 4425 len. 11]: On the spur of the moment she mentioned her name .
Parsing [sent. 4426 len. 6]: `` Where is Honor Ward ?
Parsing [sent. 4427 len. 8]: Is she in London , too ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4428 len. 15]: Stanor started ; over his features passed a quiver as of anxiety or dread .
Parsing [sent. 4429 len. 18]: He glanced across the fireplace , and the new keenness in his eyes became still more marked .
Parsing [sent. 4430 len. 5]: `` Er -- no !
Parsing [sent. 4431 len. 5]: She stopped half way .
Parsing [sent. 4432 len. 13]: Later on ... perhaps -- '' `` She is quite well ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4433 len. 6]: Again a moment 's hesitation .
Parsing [sent. 4434 len. 10]: `` Fairly well , only ... Very tired . ''
Parsing [sent. 4435 len. 14]: `` I do n't wonder she is tired ; she does so much .
Parsing [sent. 4436 len. 7]: Always rushing about after something new .
Parsing [sent. 4437 len. 9]: They seem very restless people in America . ''
Parsing [sent. 4438 len. 12]: `` They 're alive , anyway ; they do n't rust !
Parsing [sent. 4439 len. 19]: They 're bound to get the most that 's possible out of life , and they get it !
Parsing [sent. 4440 len. 21]: It shakes a fellow up to get out of the rut here and have a taste of their methods . ''
Parsing [sent. 4441 len. 12]: `` You like it -- better than _ home _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4442 len. 26]: Pixie paused , teapot in hand , to cast upon him a glance full of patriotic reproach , whereat he laughed and shrugged his shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 4443 len. 20]: `` Is n't home the place where one settles down , and which feels to be most congenial ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4444 len. 10]: `` You find America more congenial than England ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4445 len. 15]: He shrugged again , and the old gleam of laughter showed in his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4446 len. 19]: `` Now look here , is n't it bad luck to begin asking embarrassing questions straight away off ?
Parsing [sent. 4447 len. 10]: I hoped I was going to avoid this point !
Parsing [sent. 4448 len. 12]: If you must have the truth -- I _ do _ !
Parsing [sent. 4449 len. 5]: America suits me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4450 len. 13]: -- his smile was full of complacence -- `` I suit America .
Parsing [sent. 4451 len. 10]: That 's not by any means a sure thing .
Parsing [sent. 4452 len. 10]: Many Englishmen throw up the sponge and return home .
Parsing [sent. 4453 len. 15]: They ca n't adapt themselves , do n't _ want _ to adapt themselves .
Parsing [sent. 4454 len. 39]: In my case I had had no business experience in England , so I began with an open mind without prejudice , and -- it _ went _ : I like the life , I like the people .
Parsing [sent. 4455 len. 5]: I like the climate .
Parsing [sent. 4456 len. 20]: The climate is answerable for a lot of the extra energy which you over here call ` restlessness . '
Parsing [sent. 4457 len. 14]: You want to do just about twice as much beneath those skies ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4458 len. 9]: He cast an impatient glance towards the window .
Parsing [sent. 4459 len. 9]: `` It 's all so _ grey _ !
Parsing [sent. 4460 len. 14]: ... I 've had a headache straight on the last two days . ''
Parsing [sent. 4461 len. 12]: `` Tea 's ready now ; it will do you good .
Parsing [sent. 4462 len. 13]: There are hot scones in that dish , '' Pixie said quietly .
Parsing [sent. 4463 len. 18]: The greyness of the street seemed to have entered the room -- to have entered her heart .
Parsing [sent. 4464 len. 7]: It was _ all _ grey .
Parsing [sent. 4465 len. 23]: ... `` We knew , of course , that you _ must _ like it , when you stayed so long . ''
Parsing [sent. 4466 len. 11]: Now there was something which was _ not grey _ .
Parsing [sent. 4467 len. 30]: Stanor 's face flushed a painful red ; he looked at his cup , at the floor , in the fire , at anything but in Pixie 's face .
Parsing [sent. 4468 len. 8]: His voice was hard with repressed embarrassment .
Parsing [sent. 4469 len. 12]: `` Er -- just so ; you would , of course !
Parsing [sent. 4470 len. 6]: There was work on hand .
Parsing [sent. 4471 len. 7]: I waited to see it through .
Parsing [sent. 4472 len. 25]: When a man has spent two years in the same place so many claims arise , in social life as well as in work .
Parsing [sent. 4473 len. 14]: It is difficult for him to break away at a moment 's notice .
Parsing [sent. 4474 len. 8]: He is hardly his own master . ''
Parsing [sent. 4475 len. 7]: `` I 'm sure it is .
Parsing [sent. 4476 len. 13]: And when there was work you were quite right to stay on .
Parsing [sent. 4477 len. 12]: It would have been wrong to have left it unfinished . ''
Parsing [sent. 4478 len. 23]: Stanor , looked up sharply , met clear , honest eyes , which looked back into his without a trace of sarcasm .
Parsing [sent. 4479 len. 6]: She _ meant _ it !
Parsing [sent. 4480 len. 8]: Voice and look alike were transparently genuine .
Parsing [sent. 4481 len. 23]: At that moment she was essentially the Pixie of old , the Pixie to whom it came naturally to believe the best .
Parsing [sent. 4482 len. 23]: The flush on Stanor 's cheeks deepened as he realised the nature of the `` work '' which had made his excuse .
Parsing [sent. 4483 len. 11]: His voice deepened with the first real note of intimacy .
Parsing [sent. 4484 len. 8]: `` That 's like you , Pixie !
Parsing [sent. 4485 len. 4]: You always understood .
Parsing [sent. 4486 len. 8]: ... And now tell me about yourself .
Parsing [sent. 4487 len. 10]: What 's happened to you since I heard last ?
Parsing [sent. 4488 len. 7]: Six months ago , was it ?
Parsing [sent. 4489 len. 2]: No !
Parsing [sent. 4490 len. 3]: barely four .
Parsing [sent. 4491 len. 7]: Did n't you write for Christmas ?
Parsing [sent. 4492 len. 15]: Been jogging along as usual at home , playing games with the babies ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4493 len. 10]: `` Yes ; just jogging , '' said Pixie .
Parsing [sent. 4494 len. 9]: Then of a sudden her eyes flashed . ''
Parsing [sent. 4495 len. 20]: ` Over here ' we do n't find the ` best of life ' in a _ rush _ !
Parsing [sent. 4496 len. 12]: It comes to some of us quite satisfactorily in a jog !
Parsing [sent. 4497 len. 45]: ` I guess , ' as you say , that my life as been as much ` worth while ' as if I 'd spent it in a round of pink luncheons and green teas , as your American friends seem to do . ''
Parsing [sent. 4498 len. 22]: The unexpected happened , and , instead of protesting , Stanor sighed , and looked of a sudden grave and depressed .
Parsing [sent. 4499 len. 20]: `` You 're right there , Pixie ; that 's so , if you are built the right way !
Parsing [sent. 4500 len. 20]: But some of us -- '' He checked himself , and began afresh in a voice of enforced enthusiasm .
Parsing [sent. 4501 len. 3]: `` Well !
Parsing [sent. 4502 len. 20]: -- and then you came up here to nurse your brother , and found the Runkle already in possession .
Parsing [sent. 4503 len. 15]: I _ was _ surprised to read about that in your letter at Liverpool .
Parsing [sent. 4504 len. 11]: Odd , is n't it , how things come about ?
Parsing [sent. 4505 len. 10]: And how _ is _ the old fellow ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4506 len. 9]: Again Pixie 's eyes sent out a flash .
Parsing [sent. 4507 len. 19]: How was it that every fresh thing that Stanor said seemed to hurt her in a new place ?
Parsing [sent. 4508 len. 16]: `` Considering his great years and infirmities , the old fellow seems surprisingly well . ''
Parsing [sent. 4509 len. 8]: `` Halloo , what 's this ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4510 len. 5]: Stanor stared in surprise .
Parsing [sent. 4511 len. 9]: `` Said the wrong thing , have I ?
Parsing [sent. 4512 len. 5]: What have I said ?
Parsing [sent. 4513 len. 16]: He seems old , you know , if he is n't actually so in years .
Parsing [sent. 4514 len. 10]: I used to look upon him as a patriarch .
Parsing [sent. 4515 len. 9]: Not so much his looks as his character .
Parsing [sent. 4516 len. 7]: Such a sombre old beggar ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4517 len. 11]: `` He was n't sombre with _ us _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4518 len. 30]: Memory flashed back pictures of Stephen 's face as he sat in the arm-chair by the fire , listening to those impromptu concerts which had enlivened Pat 's convalescence .
Parsing [sent. 4519 len. 29]: Pixie saw him as he leaned forward in his chair , waving his hand baton-like , heard his voice , joining lustily in the `` Matches '' chorus .
Parsing [sent. 4520 len. 15]: In that very room -- in the very chair in which Stanor now sat .
Parsing [sent. 4521 len. 16]: ... What centuries seemed to have lolled by , between that day , and this !
Parsing [sent. 4522 len. 5]: `` Was n't he ?
Parsing [sent. 4523 len. 4]: That 's good !
Parsing [sent. 4524 len. 12]: I 'm glad to hear that , '' Stanor said perfunctorily .
Parsing [sent. 4525 len. 15]: `` It takes time , of course , to get out of invalid ways .
Parsing [sent. 4526 len. 16]: I shall have to be running down to see him one of these days . ''
Parsing [sent. 4527 len. 11]: `` Oh , of course ; he 'll expect you .
Parsing [sent. 4528 len. 12]: And then -- then you 'll begin your work over here .
Parsing [sent. 4529 len. 7]: In London , I suppose ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4530 len. 11]: `` I ... er ... the firm is in town .
Parsing [sent. 4531 len. 13]: There -- er -- there will be a lot to arrange . ''
Parsing [sent. 4532 len. 17]: Suddenly Stanor leaned forward , his elbows on his knees , his eyes searching her face .
Parsing [sent. 4533 len. 15]: `` Pixie , this is an odd sort of conversation for our first meeting !
Parsing [sent. 4534 len. 7]: ... We 've got wrong somehow .
Parsing [sent. 4535 len. 7]: ... Ca n't we get right ?
Parsing [sent. 4536 len. 6]: Why waste time on generalities .
Parsing [sent. 4537 len. 14]: ... Are you _ glad _ to see me back , Pixie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4538 len. 5]: `` I am ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4539 len. 9]: Pixie 's eyes gazed back without a flicker .
Parsing [sent. 4540 len. 11]: `` When I got your letter I was -- thankful !
Parsing [sent. 4541 len. 12]: I think it was -- time -- you came back . ''
Parsing [sent. 4542 len. 16]: `` Have you missed me , Pixie , while , I 've been away ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4543 len. 12]: Now she hesitated , but her eyes remained steady and candid .
Parsing [sent. 4544 len. 22]: `` It had been such a little time , you know ; and you had never stayed with us at home .
Parsing [sent. 4545 len. 22]: I could hardly _ miss _ you out of my life , but I ... _ thought _ of you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4546 len. 6]: `` Did you , Pixie ?
Parsing [sent. 4547 len. 6]: Did you , little Pixie ?
Parsing [sent. 4548 len. 10]: ... I wonder _ what _ you thought ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4549 len. 7]: Pixie did not answer that question .
Parsing [sent. 4550 len. 11]: The answer would have been too long , too complicated .
Parsing [sent. 4551 len. 14]: She smiled , a wistful little smile , and turned away her head .
Parsing [sent. 4552 len. 4]: Then Stanor rose .
Parsing [sent. 4553 len. 46]: She heard him rise , heard the chink of the tea-things on the tray as he pressed upon it in rising , heard his footsteps passing round the table towards her chair , heard in a sickening silence his summoning voice -- `` Pixie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4554 len. 4]: `` Stanor ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4555 len. 13]: They looked at each other ; -- white , strained , tense .
Parsing [sent. 4556 len. 9]: `` Pixie , will you marry me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4557 len. 8]: `` Yes , Stanor , I will .
Parsing [sent. 4558 len. 10]: If you want me ... '' CHAPTER TWENTY SIX .
Parsing [sent. 4559 len. 7]: `` WHAT HAVE I DONE ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4560 len. 15]: There was a moment 's silence , a moment which seemed like an hour .
Parsing [sent. 4561 len. 11]: Then Stanor spoke -- `` Thank you , Pixie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4562 len. 26]: He put his arms round her , made as if to kiss her cheek , but the small hands held him off with unexpected strength .
Parsing [sent. 4563 len. 4]: `` Not yet !
Parsing [sent. 4564 len. 3]: Not yet !
Parsing [sent. 4565 len. 8]: You have n't answered my question ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4566 len. 6]: `` What question ? '' ''
Parsing [sent. 4567 len. 8]: _ If you want me _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4568 len. 9]: The grey eyes were very near his own .
Parsing [sent. 4569 len. 10]: They seemed to search into his very soul . ''
Parsing [sent. 4570 len. 10]: _ Do _ you want me , Stanor ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4571 len. 7]: `` Pixie , what a question !
Parsing [sent. 4572 len. 10]: You ... you _ know _ the answer . ''
Parsing [sent. 4573 len. 7]: `` I think I do . ''
Parsing [sent. 4574 len. 9]: She nodded her head with a grave certainty .
Parsing [sent. 4575 len. 7]: `` I 'm sure I do .
Parsing [sent. 4576 len. 12]: ... You _ do n't _ want me , Stanor ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4577 len. 12]: He started at that , and his hands relaxed their hold .
Parsing [sent. 4578 len. 19]: The dull red flush mounted once more to his forehead , his lips twitched , and twitched again .
Parsing [sent. 4579 len. 16]: The man was suffering , and the marks of his pain were plain to read .
Parsing [sent. 4580 len. 8]: `` Why ... should you say that ?
Parsing [sent. 4581 len. 6]: Pixie , what is it ?
Parsing [sent. 4582 len. 8]: I explained about that extra six months .
Parsing [sent. 4583 len. 6]: ... You said you understood .
Parsing [sent. 4584 len. 16]: It was part of the agreement that we were not to write except on occasions .
Parsing [sent. 4585 len. 5]: Were my letters wrong ?
Parsing [sent. 4586 len. 6]: Did n't they please you ?
Parsing [sent. 4587 len. 9]: I was never a good hand at letter-writing .
Parsing [sent. 4588 len. 4]: Was that it ?
Parsing [sent. 4589 len. 4]: What was it ?
Parsing [sent. 4590 len. 14]: What have I done , Pixie , to make you doubt me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4591 len. 18]: `` I do n't think , '' said Pixie dreamily , `` you have done anything . ''
Parsing [sent. 4592 len. 24]: It seemed for a moment as if she had nothing more to say , then suddenly she asked another question : `` Stanor !
Parsing [sent. 4593 len. 26]: That day in Liverpool , on the landing-stage , did you notice a girl standing near me -- a girl with a fur cap ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4594 len. 5]: `` No , Pixie .
Parsing [sent. 4595 len. 9]: I noticed only one girl -- yourself ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4596 len. 25]: `` She was parting from a man -- her lover or husband -- who was leaning over the rail and looking down at her .
Parsing [sent. 4597 len. 8]: Stanor ... they ... _ cared _ !
Parsing [sent. 4598 len. 5]: They loved each other .
Parsing [sent. 4599 len. 13]: ... All these years I have had their faces in my heart .
Parsing [sent. 4600 len. 18]: I looked at them , and I looked at you , and I understood the difference ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4601 len. 8]: `` I was miserable enough , Pixie .
Parsing [sent. 4602 len. 13]: All men do not show their feelings in the same way . ''
Parsing [sent. 4603 len. 7]: `` I knew you were sorry .
Parsing [sent. 4604 len. 6]: I was sorry , too .
Parsing [sent. 4605 len. 7]: ... I 'm not blaming you .
Parsing [sent. 4606 len. 8]: I 've no right to blame you .
Parsing [sent. 4607 len. 12]: I have waited for you , and you 've come back .
Parsing [sent. 4608 len. 8]: You have asked me to marry you .
Parsing [sent. 4609 len. 3]: Stanor ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4610 len. 15]: She clasped his arms with her hands , her eyes intently gazing into his .
Parsing [sent. 4611 len. 10]: `` I 'll tell you the truth about myself .
Parsing [sent. 4612 len. 10]: -- I was a child when you went away .
Parsing [sent. 4613 len. 8]: I did n't know how to love .
Parsing [sent. 4614 len. 4]: Now I do !
Parsing [sent. 4615 len. 44]: If you love me , Stanor , with your whole heart and soul , more than any one in the world , more than _ anything _ in the world , then marry me , dear , and I 'll make you happy !
Parsing [sent. 4616 len. 63]: If you do n't ... if there is any doubt in your mind , if there is some one else who has grown nearer to you while you 've been away -- I should n't be angry , Stanor , only , '' her voice shook , a quiver passed over the upturned face , `` please tell me _ now _ !
Parsing [sent. 4617 len. 3]: Be honest !
Parsing [sent. 4618 len. 9]: It 's for all our lives , remember .
Parsing [sent. 4619 len. 10]: ... We 've no right to spoil our lives .
Parsing [sent. 4620 len. 12]: God gave them to us ; we 're responsible to Him .
Parsing [sent. 4621 len. 20]: _ It will _ spoil them , Stanor , if there 's not real , real love between us .
Parsing [sent. 4622 len. 22]: Now tell me ... look in my eyes and tell me , Stanor ... _ do _ you want me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4623 len. 7]: But he could not face her .
Parsing [sent. 4624 len. 24]: He wrenched himself free of her grasp , turned towards the mantelpiece , and with a groan buried his face in his hands .
Parsing [sent. 4625 len. 15]: `` Pixie , you ... you shame me ... you cover me with shame !
Parsing [sent. 4626 len. 12]: I ought to have known that I could not deceive you .
Parsing [sent. 4627 len. 10]: ... You are not the sort to be deceived .
Parsing [sent. 4628 len. 8]: ... It 's worse than you think .
Parsing [sent. 4629 len. 29]: ... When the temptation came , I could have kept out of the way ... she wanted me to keep away , but I would n't do it .
Parsing [sent. 4630 len. 29]: I followed her wherever she went -- I -- you 'd better know the whole truth , and then you 'll understand the kind of fellow I am .
Parsing [sent. 4631 len. 28]: It 's not my fault that I was n't married months ago , that you did n't read it in the papers without a word of preparation !
Parsing [sent. 4632 len. 10]: That 's what I wanted ... what I proposed .
Parsing [sent. 4633 len. 6]: It was she who refused .
Parsing [sent. 4634 len. 12]: It is her doing that I _ am _ here to-day .
Parsing [sent. 4635 len. 15]: She would have nothing to say to me till I had asked you first .
Parsing [sent. 4636 len. 61]: -- I wanted to stay on in America , settle down there , and keep out of the way -- '' He had spoken with his face hidden ; now , as he finished speaking , he remained in the same position , and not a sound came to his ears but the ticking of the clock in the corner .
Parsing [sent. 4637 len. 37]: He might have been alone in the room ; a miserable conviction seized him that he _ was _ alone , that between himself and the girl by his side there had arisen an impenetrable wall .
Parsing [sent. 4638 len. 29]: As for Pixie she had promised not to be angry , but it appeared to her at that moment that she had never before known what anger meant .
Parsing [sent. 4639 len. 30]: It burned within her -- a flame of indignation and wounded faith , a throwing back on herself of all the arduous mental battles of the last few days .
Parsing [sent. 4640 len. 18]: Never , even to herself , had Pixie acknowledged that she had learned to love Stephen Glynn .
Parsing [sent. 4641 len. 45]: That it hurt her to know of his love for her ; hurt intolerably to see him depart , were truths which could not be ignored , but while Stanor lived and was faithful it was impossible even to contemplate love for another man .
Parsing [sent. 4642 len. 28]: Pixie had enough knowledge of her own nature to realise that she could be happy in giving Stanor a happiness which he could only gain through her .
Parsing [sent. 4643 len. 29]: It was as natural to her to be happy as for a flower to lift its face in the sun , but for both the sun was needed .
Parsing [sent. 4644 len. 44]: A more introspective soul would have realised that there were degrees in happiness , and that she would be missing the best ; Pixie with characteristic simplicity accepted what seemed to her the right step , and shut her mind against vain regrets .
Parsing [sent. 4645 len. 8]: But -- Stanor did not want her .
Parsing [sent. 4646 len. 7]: He was _ not _ faithful .
Parsing [sent. 4647 len. 24]: He had had so little consideration for her feelings that he would have let her read of his marriage in a public print .
Parsing [sent. 4648 len. 11]: He had appeared now only at the command of another .
Parsing [sent. 4649 len. 16]: `` I think , '' said Pixie deeply , `` you are a cowardly man .
Parsing [sent. 4650 len. 12]: I am sorry for the girl you are going to marry .
Parsing [sent. 4651 len. 32]: She seems to have a conscience , but it would have been kinder of her if she had made you tell me the truth without first trying to spoil my life .
Parsing [sent. 4652 len. 31]: I suppose you _ would _ have married me if I had said ` yes , ' or was it only a form which you never intended to keep ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4653 len. 14]: `` You are hard on me , Pixie , but I deserve it .
Parsing [sent. 4654 len. 7]: I have no excuses to make .
Parsing [sent. 4655 len. 12]: My only comfort is that I have not ruined your happiness .
Parsing [sent. 4656 len. 26]: Like you , I have learnt my lesson , and I can see one thing clearly : You do n't love me , Pixie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4657 len. 17]: `` No , I do n't love you , but I have kept myself for you .
Parsing [sent. 4658 len. 10]: I have closed my heart to every other thought .
Parsing [sent. 4659 len. 13]: I _ would _ have loved you if you had needed me .
Parsing [sent. 4660 len. 14]: Nothing , nothing in the world could have made me deceive you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4661 len. 5]: `` I knew it !
Parsing [sent. 4662 len. 5]: We both knew it !
Parsing [sent. 4663 len. 10]: Honor said -- '' '' _ Honor _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4664 len. 6]: Pixie 's cry rang sharp .
Parsing [sent. 4665 len. 5]: `` Is it Honor ?
Parsing [sent. 4666 len. 4]: Honor Ward ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4667 len. 20]: Somehow the knowledge seemed an additional hurt ; she sat down on a chair and clasped her cold hands .
Parsing [sent. 4668 len. 31]: The brain flashed back memories of occasions dating back to the very beginning of Stanor 's life in America , when his name and Honor 's had been coupled together .
Parsing [sent. 4669 len. 28]: `` Honor Ward and I. '' `` Stanor Vaughan and I. '' ... Memories of an earlier occasion still when Honor had said with _ empressement _ .
Parsing [sent. 4670 len. 9]: `` You can trust me , Pixie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4671 len. 28]: Even then , had she foreseen what might happen -- even then , with her knowledge of her own character and Stanor 's , seen danger ahead ?
Parsing [sent. 4672 len. 9]: Well , Honor _ had _ been loyal !
Parsing [sent. 4673 len. 44]: From Stanor 's manner , even more than his words , it was obvious that had there been no impediment in the way as regards her own wishes , yet she had refused him , had sent him home to keep his troth .
Parsing [sent. 4674 len. 16]: After that first sharp moment Pixie had no coldness in her heart towards Honor Ward .
Parsing [sent. 4675 len. 29]: Stanor was talking , moving restlessly to and fro , telling the story of the past years in jerky , disconnected sentences , blaming himself , exonerating Honor .
Parsing [sent. 4676 len. 16]: The sound of his words penetrated to Pixie 's brain , but not the sense .
Parsing [sent. 4677 len. 16]: It seemed to her useless to listen ; there was nothing more to be said .
Parsing [sent. 4678 len. 12]: Suddenly she rose from her seat with an air of decision .
Parsing [sent. 4679 len. 8]: `` I think you had better go .
Parsing [sent. 4680 len. 11]: Bridgie , my sister -- Mrs Victor -- is here .
Parsing [sent. 4681 len. 9]: I would rather you did n't see her .
Parsing [sent. 4682 len. 11]: She will be angry ; they will all be angry .
Parsing [sent. 4683 len. 18]: They are fond of me , you see ; and they will think I have been humiliated .
Parsing [sent. 4684 len. 7]: I am _ not _ humiliated !
Parsing [sent. 4685 len. 18]: No one can humiliate me but myself ; but just at first they wo n't be reasonable .
Parsing [sent. 4686 len. 7]: ... Will you please go ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4687 len. 13]: `` Pixie , do n't think about me ... think of yourself !
Parsing [sent. 4688 len. 12]: I will leave it to you to tell your own story .
Parsing [sent. 4689 len. 14]: -- I have asked you to marry me , and you have refused .
Parsing [sent. 4690 len. 39]: ... Tell them that ... tell them that _ you _ refused , that it was _ your _ doing , not mine -- '' The glance of the grey eyes gave him a hot tingling of shame .
Parsing [sent. 4691 len. 11]: `` You do n't understand , '' said Pixie softly .
Parsing [sent. 4692 len. 12]: `` I am _ proud _ of being the faithful one !
Parsing [sent. 4693 len. 27]: You do n't understand ... '' She laid her hand on the door , but Stanor stopped her with another question -- `` And -- Honor ?
Parsing [sent. 4694 len. 7]: What shall I say to Honor ?
Parsing [sent. 4695 len. 7]: She thinks so much of you .
Parsing [sent. 4696 len. 8]: She 'll do nothing without your consent .
Parsing [sent. 4697 len. 17]: Some day when she comes to London ... will you ... see her , Pixie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4698 len. 5]: Pixie shook her head .
Parsing [sent. 4699 len. 12]: `` It would hurt us both , and do no good .
Parsing [sent. 4700 len. 5]: Give her my love .
Parsing [sent. 4701 len. 14]: As for you -- I ca n't give her what is not mine .
Parsing [sent. 4702 len. 17]: ... You belong to _ her _ , so there 's nothing more to be said .
Parsing [sent. 4703 len. 10]: ... I hope you will make her happy . ''
Parsing [sent. 4704 len. 7]: `` I will -- I will !
Parsing [sent. 4705 len. 17]: At this moment I seem to you an unmitigated scoundrel , but things will be different .
Parsing [sent. 4706 len. 7]: ... We shall settle in America .
Parsing [sent. 4707 len. 8]: I will help her with her work .
Parsing [sent. 4708 len. 5]: We 'll work together .
Parsing [sent. 4709 len. 15]: I 'd give my life for her ... I _ will _ give it !
Parsing [sent. 4710 len. 21]: I 'll make amends ... '' He stood still , waiting as if there were still more to be said .
Parsing [sent. 4711 len. 13]: `` My uncle will be angry , but it is his doing .
Parsing [sent. 4712 len. 16]: If it had not been for him , we should have been married years ago .
Parsing [sent. 4713 len. 12]: He should n't blame me for what he has brought about .
Parsing [sent. 4714 len. 5]: His is the blame .
Parsing [sent. 4715 len. 20]: If I see him -- _ when _ I see him -- can I say anything from you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4716 len. 17]: `` Tell him , '' said Pixie clearly , `` that I am grateful to him .
Parsing [sent. 4717 len. 8]: _ His is the praise _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4718 len. 4]: CHAPTER TWENTY SEVEN .
Parsing [sent. 4719 len. 4]: HONOR 'S LETTER .
Parsing [sent. 4720 len. 6]: Bridgie _ was _ angry .
Parsing [sent. 4721 len. 25]: It was rarely indeed that her placid nature was roused to wrath , but she did the thing thoroughly when she was about it .
Parsing [sent. 4722 len. 76]: In a flow of eloquence , worthy of Esmeralda herself , she revived incidents in Pixie 's life , dating from babyhood onwards , to prove to the chairs and tables , and any odd pieces of furniture which might happen to be listening , the blameless and beautiful character of the maid who had even been spurned -LRB- `` spurned '' was the word used -RRB- by a recreant unworthy the name of scoundrel .
Parsing [sent. 4723 len. 31]: She dived into the past , and pictured the feelings of those past and gone ; she projected herself into the future , and bequeathed a Corsican legacy of revenge .
Parsing [sent. 4724 len. 35]: She lavished blame on Joan , Geoffrey , herself , Jack and Sylvia , Pat and Miles , even the beloved Dick himself , and refused to hear a word in Honor 's defence .
Parsing [sent. 4725 len. 34]: The only person who came unscathed through the ordeal was Stephen Glynn , whom , it would appear , had absorbed in himself the wisdom which every one else had so shamefully lacked .
Parsing [sent. 4726 len. 6]: When Bridgie ended Pat began .
Parsing [sent. 4727 len. 30]: The news had had an unexpected effect , in rousing the invalid and restoring him to a feeling of health more powerfully than a hundred tonics could have done .
Parsing [sent. 4728 len. 29]: For the first time for weeks past he forgot himself and his woes , and behold a new man , with a strength and vitality astounding to witness .
Parsing [sent. 4729 len. 56]: Pat announced his intention of sallying forth and thrashing the beggar forthwith ; he dealt bitterly with the squeamishness of the English law with regard to duels , declared in the same breath that he could never have believed in the possibility of such behaviour , and that he had prophesied it from the first .
Parsing [sent. 4730 len. 15]: He adjured Pixie repeatedly , and with unction , to `` Buck up ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4731 len. 33]: and when the poor girl protested valiantly that she _ was _ bucking , immediately adjured her to be honest , for pity 's sake , and `` let herself go ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4732 len. 30]: An ordinary person would have found such a form of comfort far from soothing , but Pixie was an O'Shaughnessy herself , and it _ did _ soothe her .
Parsing [sent. 4733 len. 36]: She understood that Bridgie and Pat were relieving themselves by saying all that they felt , _ more _ than they felt , and that presently the storm would pass and the sun shine again .
Parsing [sent. 4734 len. 8]: By to-morrow all bitterness would have passed .
Parsing [sent. 4735 len. 50]: She sat in her chair and submitted meekly to be lectured and cajoled , wrapped in a shawl , provided with a footstool , ordered to bed , supplied with smelling-salts , and even -- tentatively -- with sal-volatile , but she made no attempt to still the storm .
Parsing [sent. 4736 len. 8]: She knew that it would be useless !
Parsing [sent. 4737 len. 50]: Finally Pat stumped off to his bedroom , to draft a rough copy of a letter intended to be the most scathing communication which had ever passed through the post ; and Bridgie , very white and shaken , seated herself on a chair by her sister 's side .
Parsing [sent. 4738 len. 14]: `` Pixie , dear -- I 'm afraid we 've not been helpful .
Parsing [sent. 4739 len. 13]: ... I lost my head , but it was such a shock .
Parsing [sent. 4740 len. 16]: -- I flew into a passion without hearing what you had to say for yourself .
Parsing [sent. 4741 len. 18]: ... Darling , tell me -- tell me honestly -- _ how do you feel _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4742 len. 41]: `` I feel -- '' Pixie raised both hands , and moved them up and down above her shoulders , as though balancing a heavy load -- `` as though a great ton weight had been rolled off my shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 4743 len. 3]: ... Bridgie !
Parsing [sent. 4744 len. 18]: You are angry ; I was angry too , but now I 've had time to think .
Parsing [sent. 4745 len. 21]: ... There have been two and a half years since he went away -- that 's about nine hundred days .
Parsing [sent. 4746 len. 3]: ... Bridgie !
Parsing [sent. 4747 len. 32]: If you only knew it -- there 's not been one day out of all that nine hundred when you had n't more cause to pity me than you have to-day !
Parsing [sent. 4748 len. 11]: -- '' Suddenly , passionately , she burst into tears .
Parsing [sent. 4749 len. 9]: ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Two days later Bridgie Victor returned home .
Parsing [sent. 4750 len. 21]: The need for chaperonage was over , and it was abundantly evident that Pixie was in no need of consolation .
Parsing [sent. 4751 len. 31]: The first shock of disillusionment over , it was pre-eminently relief that she felt -- relief from a bond which had weighed more and more heavily as time passed by .
Parsing [sent. 4752 len. 81]: If Stanor had come home , looking his old self , caring for her , depending on her as he had done during the days of their brief engagement , she would have been ready and willing to give him her life , but it had been a strange man who had entered the sitting-room of the little flat , a man with a strange face , and a strange voice , and a heart that belonged to another girl .
Parsing [sent. 4753 len. 27]: Pixie was _ free _ ; the bonds which had bound her were loosed , and with each hour that passed her liberty became more sweet .
Parsing [sent. 4754 len. 44]: She shared in her sister 's relief that the understanding with Stanor had been known to no one outside the family , for no human girl enjoys being pitied for such an experience , and Pixie had her own full share of conceit .
Parsing [sent. 4755 len. 30]: It was comforting to know that there would be no talk , no fuss ; that she could go her way , free from the consciousness of watching eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4756 len. 25]: On the morning of Bridgie 's departure two letters arrived by the first post , and were read in silence by their respective owners .
Parsing [sent. 4757 len. 30]: Bridgie 's was in a man 's handwriting , and the perusal of its lines brought a flush to her cheeks and the glimmer of tears to her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4758 len. 22]: She put it in her pocket when she had finished reading , and remained densely oblivious of her sister 's hints .
Parsing [sent. 4759 len. 7]: `` What does he say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4760 len. 4]: `` Who ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4761 len. 7]: `` Mr Glynn , of course .
Parsing [sent. 4762 len. 4]: Do n't pretend !
Parsing [sent. 4763 len. 6]: I know his writing . ''
Parsing [sent. 4764 len. 20]: `` He 's very ... very -- I do n't know exactly _ what _ he is , Pixie .
Parsing [sent. 4765 len. 12]: He is as we all were at first -- upset ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4766 len. 7]: `` What does he say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4767 len. 11]: `` Oh , er -- er -- the usual things .
Parsing [sent. 4768 len. 2]: Sorry .
Parsing [sent. 4769 len. 2]: Ashamed .
Parsing [sent. 4770 len. 23]: It 's so difficult for him , because , of course , in a certain sense it _ is _ his doing .
Parsing [sent. 4771 len. 14]: ... Naturally , he feels -- '' `` What does he say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4772 len. 12]: `` Pixie , _ do n't _ go on repeating that !
Parsing [sent. 4773 len. 4]: It 's stupid .
Parsing [sent. 4774 len. 7]: I 've _ told _ you !
Parsing [sent. 4775 len. 8]: And there 's a message for you .
Parsing [sent. 4776 len. 20]: He thanks you for _ your _ message , -LRB- I did n't know you had sent one ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 4777 len. 9]: and says it was ` like you . '
Parsing [sent. 4778 len. 6]: What did you say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4779 len. 7]: But Pixie did not enlighten her .
Parsing [sent. 4780 len. 12]: `` I think he ought to have written to me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4781 len. 4]: she said decisively .
Parsing [sent. 4782 len. 14]: `` After all , Bridgie , it is my business , not yours .
Parsing [sent. 4783 len. 9]: I thought he _ would _ write . ''
Parsing [sent. 4784 len. 7]: Bridgie had the grace to blush .
Parsing [sent. 4785 len. 12]: `` But just at first , dear , it is difficult .
Parsing [sent. 4786 len. 7]: -- He feels it so much .
Parsing [sent. 4787 len. 8]: It 's easier to a third person .
Parsing [sent. 4788 len. 25]: Later on , in a few months ' time , when things have settled down , he wants to come north to see us .
Parsing [sent. 4789 len. 11]: It will be easier then ... '' `` Oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4790 len. 19]: Pixie seemed of a sudden as eager to avoid the subject as she had been to continue it .
Parsing [sent. 4791 len. 15]: She handed her own letter across the table with a short `` From Honor !
Parsing [sent. 4792 len. 18]: You may read it , '' and thereby protected herself against the scrutiny of Bridgie 's eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4793 len. 29]: The sheet was covered with a large , straggling handwriting , and Pixie , reading it , had seemed to hear Honor 's very voice speaking to her .
Parsing [sent. 4794 len. 38]: `` My dear Patricia , -- I guess you may not want to hear from me , but I 'm bound to write , and maybe I can say a few things that will help us both .
Parsing [sent. 4795 len. 9]: You 're feeling pretty badly at the moment .
Parsing [sent. 4796 len. 28]: But I want you just to realise that I 've been feeling that way for a good year back , and to try to see both sides .
Parsing [sent. 4797 len. 20]: `` It began , Patricia , through our both feeling lone and lorn and trying to comfort each other .
Parsing [sent. 4798 len. 14]: You 'll recollect you _ asked _ me to be good to him !
Parsing [sent. 4799 len. 28]: Things went on all right for a spell , but before we knew where we were that friendship had got to be too important to us both .
Parsing [sent. 4800 len. 42]: There was n't a thought of disloyalty in it , Patricia , on his part or mine , and the very first time I had an inkling of what was happening I went off west for a tour of four months .
Parsing [sent. 4801 len. 24]: I presume it was too late by that time , for when I went home -LRB- I was bound to go home ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 4802 len. 8]: matters did n't seem to have mended .
Parsing [sent. 4803 len. 40]: After a while we had it out -- it was bound to come some time -- and I told Stanor straight he 'd either got to make a clean breast of things to you or never see me again .
Parsing [sent. 4804 len. 34]: Up till then , I guess , we 'd behaved as well as any two youngsters could have been expected to do under the circumstances , but after that things went to pieces .
Parsing [sent. 4805 len. 16]: He _ would n't _ tell , and he _ could n't _ keep away !
Parsing [sent. 4806 len. 6]: I 'm not defending Stanor .
Parsing [sent. 4807 len. 10]: He 's shown up pretty badly over this business .
Parsing [sent. 4808 len. 11]: He 's been weak , and obstinate , and dishonourable .
Parsing [sent. 4809 len. 19]: I do n't delude myself a mite , but , you see , Pixie , I love him !
Parsing [sent. 4810 len. 19]: It 's the real thing with both of us this time , and that makes a mighty difference .
Parsing [sent. 4811 len. 47]: I can see his faults and feel sorry about them , but it do n't make me love him any the less ; and if all my money were to pan out to-morrow he 'd be sorry , but he 'd love me just the same .
Parsing [sent. 4812 len. 26]: So there it was , Pixie -- and a wearing time I 've had of it , fighting against his wishes -- and my own !
Parsing [sent. 4813 len. 25]: In the end I decided to join some friends and come over to Europe , and leave him to think things over by himself .
Parsing [sent. 4814 len. 13]: Maybe I guessed he 'd follow and be forced to meet you .
Parsing [sent. 4815 len. 13]: It 's difficult to understand one 's own motives at these times .
Parsing [sent. 4816 len. 24]: Anyway , before I knew where I was he 'd taken a berth in the same boat , and -- here we are !
Parsing [sent. 4817 len. 11]: `` Stanor says you have grown-up , and look different .
Parsing [sent. 4818 len. 30]: You are both different after these years apart , and , anyway , it was a mistake from the beginning , Patricia , and would n't have worked out .
Parsing [sent. 4819 len. 26]: Now , _ we _ suit each other , and the life we are going to lead will bring out the best in us both !
Parsing [sent. 4820 len. 28]: He seems to you pretty contemptible at this moment , but there 's so many sides to one human creature , and that is only one side .
Parsing [sent. 4821 len. 19]: He 's got lots of others that are good and true -- `` Yesterday I had an ordeal .
Parsing [sent. 4822 len. 9]: I was introduced to the ` Runkle . '
Parsing [sent. 4823 len. 10]: Why did n't I know he was like that ?
Parsing [sent. 4824 len. 12]: He was quite courteous -- he could n't be anything else .
Parsing [sent. 4825 len. 9]: But his eyes , -LRB- what eyes ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 4826 len. 18]: made arches at me , as if to say , ` He prefers _ her _ ! '
Parsing [sent. 4827 len. 6]: and I felt frozen stiff .
Parsing [sent. 4828 len. 56]: Now I sha n't rest satisfied till that man 's my friend , but it will take time -- `` Pixie , we 're going to be married quite soon -- as soon as ever we can fix up the necessary formalities , spend a honeymoon in Switzerland , and get back to our work .
Parsing [sent. 4829 len. 37]: I do n't ask to see you -- just at the moment it would do no good , but could n't you just manage to send me a line to melt this stone in my heart ?
Parsing [sent. 4830 len. 11]: I 'd be so happy if it was n't there .
Parsing [sent. 4831 len. 19]: But it wo n't melt till I hear from you , that you understand , and you forgive !
Parsing [sent. 4832 len. 7]: `` Lovingly , -- Honor . ''
Parsing [sent. 4833 len. 14]: Bridgie read and sighed , folded the sheet carefully , and sighed again .
Parsing [sent. 4834 len. 13]: `` It 's so _ difficult _ , '' -- she began .
Parsing [sent. 4835 len. 6]: `` What is difficult ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4836 len. 13]: `` To be as angry with people as you would like ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4837 len. 4]: replied Bridgie unexpectedly .
Parsing [sent. 4838 len. 75]: `` You start by thinking that all the right is on your own side , and all the wrong on theirs , and that you 're a martyr and they are brutes , and that your case is proven and there 's not a word that could be said in their defence ; and then of a sudden -- '' she lifted the letter in her hand -- `` you get _ this _ !
Parsing [sent. 4839 len. 33]: And they _ have _ a side , and they are not brutes ; and instead of being angry you have to be -- you are forced into being -- sorry instead !
Parsing [sent. 4840 len. 5]: It does feel hard !
Parsing [sent. 4841 len. 32]: I did n't _ want _ to be sorry for Honor Ward ... '' `` I 'm not sorry for her , '' said Pixie softly , `` I 'm glad .
Parsing [sent. 4842 len. 7]: She 's going to be happy .
Parsing [sent. 4843 len. 17]: ... Bridgie , dear , what can I send her , for a wedding present ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4844 len. 4]: CHAPTER TWENTY EIGHT .
Parsing [sent. 4845 len. 5]: PIXIE FINDS HER HAPPINESS .
Parsing [sent. 4846 len. 40]: As soon as Pat had sufficiently recovered , he and Pixie travelled to Ireland to spend a few weeks in the old homestead , now blooming in fresh beauty under the management of Jack O'Shaughnessy and Sylvia his wife .
Parsing [sent. 4847 len. 80]: The great hall which had been of old so bare and desolate was now embellished with Turkey carpets and tapestried walls : so far as the eye could reach there was not one shabby , nor broken , nor patched-up article ; in sight ; the damp and fusty odour which had filled the great drawing-room , and which for years had been associated with State apartments in Pixie 's youthful mind , was a thing of the past .
Parsing [sent. 4848 len. 55]: Even in the chilliest weather the room remained warm , for electric radiators , cunningly hidden from sight , dispelled the damp , and were kept turned on night and day , `` whether they were needed , or whether they were not , '' to the delight and admiration of the Irish staff .
Parsing [sent. 4849 len. 22]: For pure extravagance , for pure pagan delight in extravagance , the Irishman _ and _ woman are hard to beat .
Parsing [sent. 4850 len. 36]: The very warmth and generosity of their nature makes it abhorrent to them to stint in any direction , which is one reason , out of many , for the prevailing poverty of the land .
Parsing [sent. 4851 len. 28]: Jack and Sylvia made delightful hosts , and it was a very happy and a very merry quartette which passed those spring days together in Knock Castle .
Parsing [sent. 4852 len. 34]: They were complete in themselves , and any suggestion of `` a party '' was instantly vetoed by the visitors , who announced their desire to remain `` just as we are . ''
Parsing [sent. 4853 len. 46]: Sylvia and Pixie rode or drove about the country , pulling up every half mile or so to chat with cottagers , who were all eager to see Miss Pixie , to invoke blessings on her head , and -- begging her honour 's pardon !
Parsing [sent. 4854 len. 16]: -- to sigh a sigh for the memory of the times that were no more .
Parsing [sent. 4855 len. 29]: On frequent occasions this same curious , and to English-bred Sylvia , inexplicable regret for the days of old was manifested by the dwellers on the country-side . ''
Parsing [sent. 4856 len. 8]: _ What did they want _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4857 len. 5]: she asked herself impatiently .
Parsing [sent. 4858 len. 14]: `` What could they wish for that had not already been done ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4859 len. 36]: Repaired cottages , improved sanitation , higher wages , perquisites without number -- since the new reign all these things had been bestowed upon these ungratefuls , and still they dared to regret the past !
Parsing [sent. 4860 len. 26]: Sylvia had not yet grasped the fact that her birth and upbringing made a chasm between herself and her tenants which no kindness could span .
Parsing [sent. 4861 len. 65]: They would burn her peat , waste her food , accept , and more or less waste again , all that she chose to bestow , but given a choice between the present days of plenty and the lean , bare years of the reign of the jovial `` Major '' and his brood , they would enthusiastically have acclaimed the latter 's return .
Parsing [sent. 4862 len. 62]: Occasionally something of the same spirit would manifest itself in the O'Shaughnessys themselves , as when Jack 's voice would take on an apologetic tone in telling his brother of some improvement in the estate , or Pixie gazing at the old Persian carpet in the dining-room would sigh regretfully , `` There _ used _ to be a hole ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4863 len. 27]: On such occasions Sylvia was sometimes forced to depart on a visit to the nursery and relieve her feelings by a stamp _ en route _ .
Parsing [sent. 4864 len. 41]: When she returned Jack 's twinkling eyes would search her face , and he would take an early opportunity of passing her chair and touching her with a caressing hand , and once more all would be peace and joy .
Parsing [sent. 4865 len. 30]: Jack and his wife heard from Pat 's lips all details as to Stanor Vaughan and his approaching marriage , but to Pixie herself the subject was never mentioned .
Parsing [sent. 4866 len. 9]: `` Anyway , she 's not fretting ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4867 len. 3]: said Jack .
Parsing [sent. 4868 len. 8]: `` Never saw her brighter and happier .
Parsing [sent. 4869 len. 7]: Bless her big , little heart !
Parsing [sent. 4870 len. 13]: I 'm thankful the fellow has taken himself out of her way .
Parsing [sent. 4871 len. 12]: She 'd never have given him up of her own accord .
Parsing [sent. 4872 len. 19]: We 've all been so happy in our marriages that we ca n't stand any second-bests for Pixie !
Parsing [sent. 4873 len. 14]: When are _ you _ going to settle down , old chap ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4874 len. 13]: `` Oh , about next June year , '' replied Pat calmly .
Parsing [sent. 4875 len. 8]: `` Always said I would about twenty-eight .
Parsing [sent. 4876 len. 12]: Nice time of year , too , for a honeymoon ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4877 len. 11]: `` But ... but ... '' Jack stammered in surprise .
Parsing [sent. 4878 len. 8]: `` Have you met the girl ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4879 len. 5]: `` My good man !
Parsing [sent. 4880 len. 2]: Dozens !
Parsing [sent. 4881 len. 6]: There 's no difficulty there .
Parsing [sent. 4882 len. 8]: Faith , I love them all ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4883 len. 4]: sighed handsome Pat .
Parsing [sent. 4884 len. 44]: Well , it was a happy holiday , but there was no sadness when it came to an end , for Pat was ready and eager to get back to work , and Pixie to the northern town which meant Bridgie and home .
Parsing [sent. 4885 len. 42]: Brother and sister parted with mutual protestations of gratitude and appreciation , and with several quite substantial castles in the air as regards future meetings , and within a few days both had settled down to the routine of ordinary life .
Parsing [sent. 4886 len. 7]: `` Pixie is just the same .
Parsing [sent. 4887 len. 46]: All this business has not altered her at all , '' Captain Victor said to his wife , and Bridgie smiled at him , the same sort of loving , indulgent smile which she bestowed on her small son when he guilelessly betrayed his ignorance .
Parsing [sent. 4888 len. 33]: _ She _ knew that Pixie _ had _ altered , felt the alteration every day of her life , in a subtle , indefinite manner which had escaped the masculine observation .
Parsing [sent. 4889 len. 59]: There was a certain expression which in quiet moments had been wont to settle on the young face , an expression of repression and strain , which now appeared to have departed for good , a certain reserve in touching upon any subject connected with love and marriage , which was now replaced by eager interest and sympathy .
Parsing [sent. 4890 len. 32]: Gradually , also , as the months rolled on there came moments when a very radiance of happiness shone out of the grey eyes , and trilled in the musical voice .
Parsing [sent. 4891 len. 20]: The time of Stephen Glynn 's visit was drawing near ; another week , and he would actually arrive .
Parsing [sent. 4892 len. 9]: What would be the result of that visit ?
Parsing [sent. 4893 len. 5]: Bridgie could not tell .
Parsing [sent. 4894 len. 45]: In a matter so important she dared not take any definite role , but in her prayers that week she implored the Divine Father to send to the dearly loved little sister that which He in His wisdom knew to be _ best _ .
Parsing [sent. 4895 len. 12]: And then , as usual , Pixie did the unexpected thing .
Parsing [sent. 4896 len. 55]: The sisters were sitting together at tea the day before Stephen was expected , when suddenly she looked across the room , and said as quietly and naturally as if she had been asking the time -- `` Do ye think now , Bridgie , that he will ask me to marry him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4897 len. 3]: Bridgie started .
Parsing [sent. 4898 len. 8]: Up to her cheeks flew the red .
Parsing [sent. 4899 len. 18]: It was she who was embarrassed , she who stammered and crumbled the hem of the tablecloth .
Parsing [sent. 4900 len. 9]: `` My dear , I do n't know !
Parsing [sent. 4901 len. 4]: How should I ?
Parsing [sent. 4902 len. 7]: How can I possibly know ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4903 len. 10]: `` I did n't ask you if you knew .
Parsing [sent. 4904 len. 9]: I asked if you _ thought _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 4905 len. 10]: `` I -- do n't know what to think .
Parsing [sent. 4906 len. 9]: ... I know what he _ wants _ !
Parsing [sent. 4907 len. 11]: But he is so sensitive , so humble about himself .
Parsing [sent. 4908 len. 19]: He thinks he is too old , and ... and his lameness -- he exaggerates things all round .
Parsing [sent. 4909 len. 21]: From what he said to me in that letter -- '' `` That letter you would n't show me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4910 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 4911 len. 6]: I could n't , Pixie !
Parsing [sent. 4912 len. 15]: It was in confidence , and besides , he said nothing _ definite _ .
Parsing [sent. 4913 len. 5]: It was only inferred .
Parsing [sent. 4914 len. 17]: It 's just because he idealises you so much that he thinks he is not worthy .
Parsing [sent. 4915 len. 32]: No one can tell what a man will do when it comes to the time , but what he _ means _ to do is evidently -- to say nothing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4916 len. 4]: `` Oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4917 len. 3]: said Pixie .
Parsing [sent. 4918 len. 22]: She nibbled a fragment of cake for a thoughtful moment , and then said calmly -- `` So now I know .
Parsing [sent. 4919 len. 5]: Thank you , Bridgie .
Parsing [sent. 4920 len. 10]: _ Please _ do n't say any more ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4921 len. 31]: `` No , darling , no , I wo n't ; only please just one thing -- it has puzzled me so much , and I have longed to know .
Parsing [sent. 4922 len. 26]: ... There 's never been any reserve between us -- you have confided in me so openly all your life till just these last years .
Parsing [sent. 4923 len. 15]: _ Why _ did n't you tell me you were unhappy about Stanor ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4924 len. 15]: `` How could I , me dear , when I might be his wife ?
Parsing [sent. 4925 len. 7]: It would n't have been loyal .
Parsing [sent. 4926 len. 12]: And it was n't unhappiness exactly , only -- a weight .
Parsing [sent. 4927 len. 41]: I was _ trying _ to keep on loving him , and hating myself for finding it difficult , but I knew if he came back loving me , and wanting me to help him , the weight would go .
Parsing [sent. 4928 len. 9]: But you see , he did n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4929 len. 14]: `` Pixie , dear , one should not need to _ try _ .
Parsing [sent. 4930 len. 11]: That sort of love ought to feel no strain . ''
Parsing [sent. 4931 len. 32]: `` If Stanor had needed me , I should have married him , '' Pixie said obstinately , `` but he did n't , and , me dear , excuse me !
Parsing [sent. 4932 len. 8]: It 's not the most agreeable subject .
Parsing [sent. 4933 len. 9]: ... Let 's talk of something else . ''
Parsing [sent. 4934 len. 14]: The next day Stephen Glynn arrived , and put up at an hotel .
Parsing [sent. 4935 len. 42]: An agricultural show which was being held in the town made an excuse for his visit ; it also made a vantage ground for daily excursions , and gave opportunities of securing _ tete-a-tete _ to those anxious to do so .
Parsing [sent. 4936 len. 35]: Pixie was conscious that several such opportunities had in Stephen 's case been of intent ignored and allowed to pass by , but never once did she doubt the motive which prompted such neglect .
Parsing [sent. 4937 len. 15]: From the moment of their meeting the consciousness of his love had enveloped her .
Parsing [sent. 4938 len. 27]: He might set a seal on his lips , but he could not control his eyes , and the wistfulness of that glance made Pixie brave .
Parsing [sent. 4939 len. 38]: Almost the first opportunity for undisturbed conversation came on the afternoon of the third day , when Stephen paid an unexpected call at the house to propose an expedition for the evening , and found Pixie alone .
Parsing [sent. 4940 len. 22]: She was sitting writing in the pretty , flower-decked room , where the French window opened wide to the garden beyond .
Parsing [sent. 4941 len. 38]: It was only a mite of a garden , not big enough for even a tennis-court , but so much love and ingenuity had been lavished on its arrangement that it had an astonishing air of space .
Parsing [sent. 4942 len. 30]: The flower-covered trellis at the end had an air of being there because it chose , and not in the least because it marked an arbitrary division of land .
Parsing [sent. 4943 len. 31]: The one big tree made an oasis of shade , and had a low circular seat round its trunk , and the flowers bloomed in grateful recognition of favours bestowed .
Parsing [sent. 4944 len. 15]: There are points in which the small garden has a pull over the large .
Parsing [sent. 4945 len. 74]: Its owner can , for instance , remember just how many blooms a special plant afforded last summer , and feel a glow of pride in the extra two of the present season ; she can water them herself , tie up their drooping heads , snip off the dead flowers , know them , and love them in an intimate , personal way which is impossible in the large , professionally-run gardens .
Parsing [sent. 4946 len. 43]: Bridgie 's garden this summer afternoon made a very charming background for the figure of Pixie in her white dress , with the jaunty blue band round her waist , and a little knot to match fastening her muslin Peter Pan collar .
Parsing [sent. 4947 len. 24]: She looked very young and fresh and dainty , and the wistful expression deepened on Stephen 's face as he looked at her .
Parsing [sent. 4948 len. 29]: For the first few minutes conversation was difficult , for the consciousness of being alone seemed rather to close the way to personal subjects than to open it .
Parsing [sent. 4949 len. 28]: Stephen was grave and distrait , Pixie embarrassed and nervous , but the real deep sympathy between them made it impossible that such an atmosphere should continue .
Parsing [sent. 4950 len. 30]: Before ten minutes had passed Pixie 's laugh had sounded with the characteristic gurgle which was the very embodiment of merriment , and Stephen was perforce laughing in response .
Parsing [sent. 4951 len. 11]: He had never been able to resist Pixie 's laugh .
Parsing [sent. 4952 len. 17]: Tea was brought in , and the young hostess did the honours with a pretty hospitality .
Parsing [sent. 4953 len. 29]: It was the first meal of which they had partaken _ a deux _ , and its homely intimacy brought back the wistful look into Stephen 's eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4954 len. 64]: Perhaps Pixie noticed it , perhaps a point had been reached when she felt it impossible to go on talking generalities ; in any case , she laid down her cup , straightened herself in her chair with an air of preparing for something big and momentous , and announced clearly -- `` I had a letter this morning from Honor Vaughan . ''
Parsing [sent. 4955 len. 9]: Stephen Glynn started , and his face hardened .
Parsing [sent. 4956 len. 11]: The subject was evidently unwelcome to the point of pain .
Parsing [sent. 4957 len. 9]: `` She writes to _ you _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4958 len. 6]: `` I write to her !
Parsing [sent. 4959 len. 5]: Of course she answers .
Parsing [sent. 4960 len. 8]: I was always fond of Honor . ''
Parsing [sent. 4961 len. 3]: `` Possibly .
Parsing [sent. 4962 len. 4]: Before her marriage .
Parsing [sent. 4963 len. 19]: As Stanor 's wife , however -- '' Pixie bent forward , looking him full in the face .
Parsing [sent. 4964 len. 10]: `` I have no quarrel with Stanor 's wife .
Parsing [sent. 4965 len. 8]: I was angry with _ him _ .
Parsing [sent. 4966 len. 11]: There was something in me which he hurt very much .
Parsing [sent. 4967 len. 32]: -- I think , '' she slightly shrugged her shoulder , and a flicker of a smile passed over her face , and was gone , '' 't was my pride !
Parsing [sent. 4968 len. 14]: It hurt to think he had been _ forced _ to come back .
Parsing [sent. 4969 len. 19]: If he 'd trusted me and told the truth it would have saved suffering for us -- all !
Parsing [sent. 4970 len. 15]: At the time I felt I could never forgive him , but that passed .
Parsing [sent. 4971 len. 29]: I do n't say I can ever think of him as I did before , as quite honest and true , but -- '' The smile flashed back .
Parsing [sent. 4972 len. 13]: `` Can _ you _ go on being angry , yourself ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4973 len. 22]: `` I -- do n't think , '' said Stephen slowly , `` that ` angry ' is the right word .
Parsing [sent. 4974 len. 21]: I 'm disappointed -- disappointed with a bitterness which has its root in ten long years of hope and effort .
Parsing [sent. 4975 len. 10]: Practically I have lived my life through that boy .
Parsing [sent. 4976 len. 16]: My great object and desire was to secure for him all that I had missed .
Parsing [sent. 4977 len. 30]: I had made no definite promises , it seemed wiser not , but in effect he was my heir , and all I have would have gone to him .
Parsing [sent. 4978 len. 5]: Now that 's over !
Parsing [sent. 4979 len. 14]: The future has been taken from me , as well as the past .
Parsing [sent. 4980 len. 5]: America has absorbed him .
Parsing [sent. 4981 len. 30]: He has already , through his wife , more money than he can use , and the role of an English country gentleman has lost its attractions for him .
Parsing [sent. 4982 len. 35]: There was a time in my first outburst of indignation when I should have felt it a relief to have had some power of retaliation , but , as you say , that passed .
Parsing [sent. 4983 len. 24]: ... He was the only person whom I could in any sense claim as my own , and -- I 've lost him !
Parsing [sent. 4984 len. 7]: He is independent of me now .
Parsing [sent. 4985 len. 9]: I can do no more for him . ''
Parsing [sent. 4986 len. 8]: The dark eyes were full of pain .
Parsing [sent. 4987 len. 14]: `` That is , after all , the thing that hurts the most .
Parsing [sent. 4988 len. 10]: The lad has faults , but I loved him .
Parsing [sent. 4989 len. 18]: I lived through him ; now I can do no more , and our lives fall apart .
Parsing [sent. 4990 len. 7]: There 's a big blank ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4991 len. 5]: Pixie did not answer .
Parsing [sent. 4992 len. 25]: Her face was very pale ; in her ears was a loud thudding noise , which seemed mysteriously to be inside her own breast .
Parsing [sent. 4993 len. 43]: `` As for his wife , she may be a good girl -- she appears to have behaved in an honourable fashion -- but to me it 's a new type , and I ca n't pretend that I 'm not prejudiced .
Parsing [sent. 4994 len. 9]: There is only one thing that is satisfactory .
Parsing [sent. 4995 len. 26]: The boy is honestly in love , even to the extent of abandoning his career to assist in the management of a pickle factory . ''
Parsing [sent. 4996 len. 24]: There was an inflection in the tone in which these last words were pronounced which brought Pixie 's eyes upon him in reproach .
Parsing [sent. 4997 len. 9]: `` They are very _ good _ pickles !
Parsing [sent. 4998 len. 26]: I ca n't see that making them is any less dignified than ` bulling ' and ` bearing ' cotton -- whatever that may mean !
Parsing [sent. 4999 len. 11]: -- Stanor used to write of it in his letters .
Parsing [sent. 5000 len. 22]: Honor 's father loved his workmen , and made her promise to go on looking after them as he had done .
Parsing [sent. 5001 len. 26]: She does n't need any more money ; it would be easier for her to retire and hand over the factory to some one else .
Parsing [sent. 5002 len. 22]: It 's for the men 's sake that she keeps it on , and to keep her promise to her father .
Parsing [sent. 5003 len. 10]: Mr Glynn , you _ must _ love Honor .
Parsing [sent. 5004 len. 19]: She 's good , and true , and honourable , and she 's -- Stanor 's wife ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5005 len. 5]: `` How could he ?
Parsing [sent. 5006 len. 5]: How could he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5007 len. 20]: Stephen rose impetuously , and began pacing up and down , a rare excitement growing in voice and manner .
Parsing [sent. 5008 len. 10]: `` When he could have had _ You _ !
Parsing [sent. 5009 len. 3]: ... Good ?
Parsing [sent. 5010 len. 2]: Yes !
Parsing [sent. 5011 len. 15]: She may be good -- I 'm not denying the girl 's good points .
Parsing [sent. 5012 len. 5]: She has behaved well .
Parsing [sent. 5013 len. 21]: She has her attractions -- Stanor evidently thinks her beautiful -- but -- _ he might have had You _ !
Parsing [sent. 5014 len. 33]: ... He has chosen this girl with her ordinary attractions , instead of _ your _ sweetness , _ your _ sunshine , _ your _ generosity , _ your _ kindness !
Parsing [sent. 5015 len. 13]: Your voice , Pixie ; your eyes ... Your _ love _ !
Parsing [sent. 5016 len. 8]: He was so blind ... so deaf .
Parsing [sent. 5017 len. 25]: ... The substance was his , and for a shadow -- a poor , faint shadow -- '' Pixie had risen in her turn .
Parsing [sent. 5018 len. 23]: Red as a rose she stood before him , with shrinking eyes , but hands held out in sweet , courageous invitation .
Parsing [sent. 5019 len. 31]: `` If ye think so much of me as all that , '' said the deep voice breathlessly , '' _ would n't ye like me for yourself _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5020 len. 28]: Ten minutes later the miracle , the wonder , was as marvellous as ever : as incredible to the man whose life was suddenly irradiated with sunshine .
Parsing [sent. 5021 len. 3]: `` Pixie !
Parsing [sent. 5022 len. 3]: Pixie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5023 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 5024 len. 4]: `` My youth !
Parsing [sent. 5025 len. 18]: ... Will you give it back to me , sweetheart -- the youth that I lost ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5026 len. 4]: `` Beloved ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5027 len. 16]: said Pixie , and her voice was as the swell of a deep organ note .
Parsing [sent. 5028 len. 6]: `` It was not lost .
Parsing [sent. 5029 len. 21]: It 's been waiting for you -- '' she touched her heart with an eloquent gesture -- `` here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5030 len. 3]: THE END .
