Parsing [sent. 1 len. 7]: The Pirate , by Captain Marryat .
Parsing [sent. 2 len. 19]: `` The Pirate '' was published in 1836 , the ninth book to flow from Marryat 's pen .
Parsing [sent. 3 len. 18]: It was created as an eBook in 1998 , by Nick Hodson , and reformatted in 2005 .
Parsing [sent. 4 len. 8]: THE PIRATE , BY CAPTAIN FREDERICK MARRYAT .
Parsing [sent. 5 len. 3]: CHAPTER ONE .
Parsing [sent. 6 len. 5]: THE BAY OF BISCAY .
Parsing [sent. 7 len. 52]: It was in the latter part of the month of June , of the year seventeen hundred and ninety something , that the angry waves of the Bay of Biscay were gradually subsiding , after a gale of wind as violent as it was unusual during that period of the year .
Parsing [sent. 8 len. 133]: Still they rolled heavily ; and , at times , the wind blew up in fitful , angry gusts , as if it would fain renew the elemental combat ; but each effort was more feeble , and the dark clouds which had been summoned to the storm , now fled in every quarter before the powerful rays of the sun , who burst their masses asunder with a glorious flood of light and heat ; and , as he poured down his resplendent beams , piercing deep into the waters of that portion of the Atlantic to which we now refer , with the exception of one object , hardly visible , as at creation , there was a vast circumference of water , bounded by the fancied canopy of heaven .
Parsing [sent. 9 len. 41]: We have said , with the exception of one object ; for in the centre of this picture , so simple , yet so sublime , composed of the three great elements , there was a remnant of the fourth .
Parsing [sent. 10 len. 45]: We say a remnant , for it was but the hull of a vessel , dismasted , water-logged , its upper works only floating occasionally above the waves , when a transient repose from their still violent undulation permitted it to reassume its buoyancy .
Parsing [sent. 11 len. 44]: But this was seldom ; one moment it was deluged by the seas , which broke as they poured over its gunwale ; and the next , it rose from its submersion , as the water escaped from the portholes at its sides .
Parsing [sent. 12 len. 33]: How many thousands of vessels -- how many millions of property -- have been abandoned , and eventually consigned to the all-receiving depths of the ocean , through ignorance or through fear !
Parsing [sent. 13 len. 12]: What a mine of wealth must lie buried in its sands !
Parsing [sent. 14 len. 54]: what riches lie entangled amongst its rocks , or remain suspended in its unfathomable gulf , where the compressed fluid is equal in gravity to that which it encircles , there to remain secured in its embedment from corruption and decay , until the destruction of the universe and the return of chaos !
Parsing [sent. 15 len. 36]: -- Yet , immense as the accumulated loss may be , the major part of it has been occasioned from an ignorance of one of the first laws of nature , that of specific gravity .
Parsing [sent. 16 len. 71]: The vessel to which we have referred was , to all appearance , in a situation of as extreme hazard as that of a drowning man clinging to a single rope-yarn ; yet , in reality , she was more secure from descending to the abyss below than many gallantly careering on the waters , their occupants dismissing all fear , and only calculating upon a quick arrival into port .
Parsing [sent. 17 len. 29]: The _ Circassian _ had sailed from New Orleans , a gallant and well-appointed ship , with a cargo , the major part of which consisted of cotton .
Parsing [sent. 18 len. 24]: The captain was , in the usual acceptation of the term , a good sailor ; the crew were hardy and able seamen .
Parsing [sent. 19 len. 53]: As they crossed the Atlantic , they had encountered the gale to which we have referred , were driven down into the Bay of Biscay , where , as we shall hereafter explain , the vessel was dismasted , and sprang a leak , which baffled all their exertions to keep under .
Parsing [sent. 20 len. 42]: It was now five days since the frightened crew had quitted the vessel in two of her boats , one of which had swamped , and every soul that occupied it had perished ; the fate of the other was uncertain .
Parsing [sent. 21 len. 26]: We said that the crew had deserted the vessel , but we did not assert that every existing being had been removed out of her .
Parsing [sent. 22 len. 21]: Had such been the case , we should not have taken up the reader 's time in describing inanimate matter .
Parsing [sent. 23 len. 25]: It is life that we portray , and life there still was in the shattered hull thus abandoned to the mockery of the ocean .
Parsing [sent. 24 len. 53]: In the _ caboose _ of the _ Circassian _ , that is , in the cooking-house secured on deck , and which fortunately had been so well fixed as to resist the force of the breaking waves , remained three beings -- a man , a woman , and a child .
Parsing [sent. 25 len. 109]: The two first mentioned were of that inferior race which have , for so long a period , been procured from the sultry Afric coast , to toil , but reap not for themselves ; the child which lay at the breast of the female was of European blood , now , indeed , deadly pale , as it attempted in vain to draw sustenance from its exhausted nurse , down whose sable cheeks the tears coursed , as she occasionally pressed the infant to her breast , and turned it round to leeward to screen it from the spray which dashed over them at each returning swell .
Parsing [sent. 26 len. 37]: Indifferent to all else , save her little charge , she spoke not , although she shuddered with the cold as the water washed her knees each time that the hull was careened into the wave .
Parsing [sent. 27 len. 23]: Cold and terror had produced a change in her complexion , which now wore a yellow , or sort of copper hue .
Parsing [sent. 28 len. 41]: The male , who was her companion , sat opposite to her upon the iron range which once had been the receptacle of light and heat , but was now but a weary seat to a drenched and worn-out wretch .
Parsing [sent. 29 len. 72]: He , too , had not spoken for many hours ; with the muscles of his face relaxed , his thick lips pouting far in advance of his collapsed cheeks , his high cheekbones prominent as budding horns , his eyes displaying little but their whites , he appeared to be an object of greater misery than the female , whose thoughts were directed to the infant and not unto herself .
Parsing [sent. 30 len. 19]: Yet his feelings were still acute , although his faculties appeared to be deadened by excess of suffering .
Parsing [sent. 31 len. 6]: `` Eh , me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 32 len. 19]: cried the negro woman faintly , after a long silence , her head falling back with extreme exhaustion .
Parsing [sent. 33 len. 32]: Her companion made no reply , but , roused at the sound of her voice , bent forward , slided open the door a little , and looked out to windward .
Parsing [sent. 34 len. 25]: The heavy spray dashed into his glassy eyes , and obscured his vision ; he groaned , and fell back into his former position .
Parsing [sent. 35 len. 8]: `` What you tink , Coco ? ''
Parsing [sent. 36 len. 20]: inquired the negress , covering up more carefully the child , as she bent her head down upon it .
Parsing [sent. 37 len. 18]: A look of despair , and a shudder from cold and hunger , were the only reply .
Parsing [sent. 38 len. 20]: It was then about eight o'clock in the morning , and the swell of the ocean was fast subsiding .
Parsing [sent. 39 len. 38]: At noon the warmth of the sun was communicated to them through the planks of the _ caboose _ , while its rays poured a small stream of vivid light through the chinks of the closed panels .
Parsing [sent. 40 len. 24]: The negro appeared gradually to revive ; at last he rose , and with some difficulty contrived again to slide open the door .
Parsing [sent. 41 len. 35]: The sea had gradually decreased its violence , and but occasionally broke over the vessel ; carefully holding on by the door-jambs , Coco gained the outside , that he might survey the horizon .
Parsing [sent. 42 len. 8]: `` What you see , Coco ? ''
Parsing [sent. 43 len. 20]: said the female , observing from the _ caboose _ that his eyes were fixed upon a certain quarter .
Parsing [sent. 44 len. 45]: `` So help me God , me tink me see something ; but ab so much salt water in um eye , me no see clear , '' replied Coco , rubbing away the salt which had crystallised on his face during the morning .
Parsing [sent. 45 len. 10]: `` What you tink um like , Coco ? ''
Parsing [sent. 46 len. 28]: `` Only one bit cloud , '' replied he , entering the _ caboose _ , and resuming his seat upon the grate with a heavy sigh .
Parsing [sent. 47 len. 6]: `` Eh , me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 48 len. 21]: cried the negress , who had uncovered the child to look at it , and whose powers were sinking fast .
Parsing [sent. 49 len. 20]: `` Poor lilly Massa Eddard , him look very bad indeed -- him die very soon , me fear .
Parsing [sent. 50 len. 9]: Look , Coco , no ab breath . ''
Parsing [sent. 51 len. 20]: The child 's head fell back upon the breast of its nurse , and life appeared to be extinct .
Parsing [sent. 52 len. 20]: `` Judy , you no ab milk for piccaninny ; suppose um ab no milk , how can live ?
Parsing [sent. 53 len. 2]: Eh !
Parsing [sent. 54 len. 22]: stop , Judy , me put lilly fingers in um mouth ; suppose Massa Eddard no dead , him pull . ''
Parsing [sent. 55 len. 17]: Coco inserted his finger into the child 's mouth , and felt a slight drawing pressure .
Parsing [sent. 56 len. 14]: `` Judy , '' cried Coco , `` Massa Eddard no dead yet .
Parsing [sent. 57 len. 12]: Try now , suppose you ab lilly drop oder side . ''
Parsing [sent. 58 len. 23]: Poor Judy shook her head mournfully , and a tear rolled down her cheek ; she was aware that nature was exhausted .
Parsing [sent. 59 len. 36]: `` Coco , '' said she , wiping her cheek with the back of her hand , `` me give me heart blood for Massa Eddard ; but no ab milk -- all gone . ''
Parsing [sent. 60 len. 21]: This forcible expression of love for the child , which was used by Judy , gave an idea to Coco .
Parsing [sent. 61 len. 20]: He drew his knife out of his pocket , and very coolly sawed to the bone of his fore-finger .
Parsing [sent. 62 len. 20]: The blood flowed and trickled down to the extremity , which he applied to the mouth of the infant .
Parsing [sent. 63 len. 36]: `` See , Judy , Massa Eddard suck -- him not dead , '' cried Coco , chuckling at the fortunate result of the experiment , and forgetting at the moment their almost hopeless situation .
Parsing [sent. 64 len. 31]: The child , revived by the strange sustenance , gradually recovered its powers , and in a few minutes it pulled at the finger with a certain degree of vigour .
Parsing [sent. 65 len. 14]: `` Look Judy , how Massa Eddard take it , '' continued Coco .
Parsing [sent. 66 len. 10]: `` Pull away , Massa Eddard , pull away .
Parsing [sent. 67 len. 15]: Coco ab ten finger , and take long while suck em all dry . ''
Parsing [sent. 68 len. 16]: But the child was soon satisfied , and fell asleep in the arms of Judy .
Parsing [sent. 69 len. 13]: `` Coco , suppose you go see again , '' observed Judy .
Parsing [sent. 70 len. 13]: The negro again crawled out , and again he scanned the horizon .
Parsing [sent. 71 len. 26]: `` So help me God , dis time me tink , Judy -- yes , so help me God , me see a ship ! ''
Parsing [sent. 72 len. 5]: cried Coco , joyfully .
Parsing [sent. 73 len. 4]: `` Eh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 74 len. 16]: screamed Judy , faintly , with delight : `` den Massa Eddard no die . ''
Parsing [sent. 75 len. 14]: `` Yes , so help me God -- he come dis way ! ''
Parsing [sent. 76 len. 75]: and Coco , who appeared to have recovered a portion of his former strength and activity , clambered on the top of the _ caboose _ , where he sat , cross-legged , waving his yellow handkerchief , with the hope of attracting the attention of those on board ; for he knew that it was very possible that an object floating little more than level with the water 's surface might escape notice .
Parsing [sent. 77 len. 47]: As it fortunately happened , the frigate , for such she was , continued her course precisely for the wreck , although it had not been perceived by the look-out men at the mast-heads , whose eyes had been directed to the line of the horizon .
Parsing [sent. 78 len. 55]: In less than an hour our little party were threatened with a new danger , that of being run over by the frigate , which was now within a cable 's length of them , driving the seas before her in one widely extended foam , as she pursued her rapid and impetuous course .
Parsing [sent. 79 len. 36]: Coco shouted to his utmost , and fortunately attracted the notice of the men who were on the bowsprit , stowing away the foretopmast-staysail , which had been hoisted up to dry after the gale .
Parsing [sent. 80 len. 6]: `` Starboard , hard ! ''
Parsing [sent. 81 len. 4]: was roared out .
Parsing [sent. 82 len. 63]: `` Starboard it is , '' was the reply from the quarterdeck , and the helm was shifted without inquiry , as it always is on board of a man-of-war , although , at the same time , it behoves people to be rather careful how they pass such an order , without being prepared with a subsequent and most satisfactory explanation .
Parsing [sent. 83 len. 68]: The topmast studding-sail flapped and fluttered , the foresail shivered , and the jib filled as the frigate rounded to , narrowly missing the wreck , which was now under the bows , rocking so violently in the white foam of the agitated waters , that it was with difficulty that Coco could , by clinging to the stump of the mainmast , retain his elevated position .
Parsing [sent. 84 len. 35]: The frigate shortened sail , hove to , and lowered down a quarter-boat , and in less than five minutes Coco , Judy , and the infant , were rescued from their awful situation .
Parsing [sent. 85 len. 47]: Poor Judy , who had borne up against all for the sake of the child , placed it in the arms of the officer who relieved them , and then fell back in a state of insensibility , in which condition she was carried on board .
Parsing [sent. 86 len. 68]: Coco , as he took his place in the stern-sheets of the boat , gazed wildly round him , and then broke out into peals of extravagant laughter , which continued without intermission , and were the only replies which he could give to the interrogatories of the quarter-deck , until he fell down in a swoon , and was entrusted to the care of the surgeon .
Parsing [sent. 87 len. 3]: CHAPTER TWO .
Parsing [sent. 88 len. 3]: THE BACHELOR .
Parsing [sent. 89 len. 64]: On the evening of the same day on which the child and the two negroes had been saved from the wreck by the fortunate appearance of the frigate , Mr Witherington , of Finsbury Square , was sitting alone in his dining-room wondering what could have become of the _ Circassian _ , and why he had not received intelligence of her arrival .
Parsing [sent. 90 len. 49]: Mr Witherington , as we said before , was alone ; he had his port and his sherry before him ; and although the weather was rather warm , there was a small fire in the grate , because , as Mr Witherington asserted , it looked comfortable .
Parsing [sent. 91 len. 96]: Mr Witherington having watched the ceiling of the room for some time , although there was certainly nothing new to be discovered , filled another glass of wine , and then proceeded to make himself more comfortable by unbuttoning three more buttons of his waistcoat , pushing his wig further off his head , and casting loose all the buttons at the knees of his breeches ; he completed his arrangements by dragging towards him two chairs within his reach , putting his legs on one , while he rested his arm on the other .
Parsing [sent. 92 len. 11]: And why was not Mr Witherington to make himself comfortable ?
Parsing [sent. 93 len. 14]: He had good health , a good conscience , and eight thousand a-year .
Parsing [sent. 94 len. 57]: Satisfied with all his little arrangements , Mr Witherington sipped his port wine , and putting down his glass again , fell back in his chair , placed his hands on his breast , interwove his fingers ; and in this most comfortable position recommenced his speculations as to the non-arrival of the _ Circassian _ .
Parsing [sent. 95 len. 17]: We will leave him to his cogitations while we introduce him more particularly to our readers .
Parsing [sent. 96 len. 57]: The father of Mr Witherington was a younger son of one of the oldest and proudest families in the West Riding of Yorkshire : he had his choice of the four professions allotted to younger sons whose veins are filled with patrician blood -- the army , the navy , the law , and the church .
Parsing [sent. 97 len. 103]: The army did not suit him , he said , as marching and counter-marching were not comfortable ; the navy did not suit him , as there was little comfort in gales of wind and mouldy biscuit : the law did not suit him , as he was not sure that he would be at ease with his conscience , which would not be comfortable ; the church was also rejected , as it was , with him , connected with the idea of a small stipend , hard duty , a wife and eleven children , which were anything but comfortable .
Parsing [sent. 98 len. 94]: Much to the horror of his family he eschewed all the liberal professions , and embraced the offer of an old backslider of an uncle , who proposed to him a situation in his banking-house , and a partnership as soon as he deserved it ; the consequence was , that his relations bade him an indignant farewell , and then made no further inquiries about him : he was as decidedly cut as one of the female branches of the family would have been had she committed a _ faux pas _ .
Parsing [sent. 99 len. 49]: Nevertheless , Mr Witherington senior stuck diligently to his business , in a few years was partner , and , at the death of the old gentleman , his uncle , found himself in possession of a good property , and every year coining money at his bank .
Parsing [sent. 100 len. 22]: Mr Witherington senior then purchased a house in Finsbury Square , and thought it advisable to look out for a wife .
Parsing [sent. 101 len. 68]: Having still much of the family pride in his composition , he resolved not to muddle the blood of the Witheringtons by any cross from Cateaton Street or Mincing Lane ; and , after a proper degree of research , he selected the daughter of a Scotch earl , who went to London with a bevy of nine in a Leith smack to barter blood for wealth .
Parsing [sent. 102 len. 55]: Mr Witherington being so unfortunate as to be the first comer , had the pick of the nine ladies by courtesy ; his choice was light-haired , blue-eyed , a little freckled , and very tall , by no means bad-looking , and standing on the list in the family Bible , Number Four .
Parsing [sent. 103 len. 59]: From this union Mr Witherington had issue ; first , a daughter , christened Moggy , whom we shall soon have to introduce to our readers as a spinster of forty-seven ; and second , Antony Alexander Witherington Esquire , whom we just now have left in a very comfortable position , and in a very brown study .
Parsing [sent. 104 len. 69]: Mr Witherington senior persuaded his son to enter the banking-house , and , as a dutiful son , he entered it every day ; but he did nothing more , having made the fortunate discovery that `` his father was born before him ; '' or , in other words , that his father had plenty of money , and would be necessitated to leave it behind him .
Parsing [sent. 105 len. 41]: As Mr Witherington senior had always studied comfort , his son had early imbibed the same idea , and carried his feelings , in that respect , to a much greater excess ; he divided things into comfortable and uncomfortable .
Parsing [sent. 106 len. 46]: One fine day , Lady Mary Witherington , after paying all the household bills , paid the debt of Nature ; that is , she died : her husband paid the undertaker 's bill , so it is to be presumed that she was buried .
Parsing [sent. 107 len. 16]: Mr Witherington senior shortly afterwards had a stroke of apoplexy , which knocked him down .
Parsing [sent. 108 len. 14]: Death , who has no feelings of honour , struck him when down .
Parsing [sent. 109 len. 67]: And Mr Witherington , after having laid a few days in bed , was by a second stroke laid in the same vault as Lady Mary Witherington : and Mr Witherington junior -LRB- our Mr Witherington -RRB- after deducting 40,000 pounds for his sister 's fortune , found himself in possession of a clear 8,000 pounds per annum , and an excellent house in Finsbury Square .
Parsing [sent. 110 len. 16]: Mr Witherington considered this a comfortable income , and he therefore retired altogether from business .
Parsing [sent. 111 len. 39]: During the lifetime of his parents he had been witness to one or two matrimonial scenes , which had induced him to put down matrimony as one of the things not comfortable : therefore he remained a bachelor .
Parsing [sent. 112 len. 42]: His sister Moggy also remained unmarried ; but whether it was from a very unprepossessing squint which deterred suitors , or from the same dislike to matrimony as her brother had imbibed , it is not in our power to say .
Parsing [sent. 113 len. 31]: Mr Witherington was three years younger than his sister ; and although he had for some time worn a wig , it was only because he considered it more comfortable .
Parsing [sent. 114 len. 28]: Mr Witherington 's whole character might be summed up in two words -- eccentricity and benevolence : eccentric he certainly was , as most bachelors usually are .
Parsing [sent. 115 len. 64]: Man is but a rough pebble without the attrition received from contact with the gentler sex : it is wonderful how the ladies pumice a man down to a smoothness which occasions him to roll over and over with the rest of his species , jostling but not wounding his neighbours , as the waves of circumstances bring him into collision with them .
Parsing [sent. 116 len. 109]: Mr Witherington roused himself from his deep reverie , and felt for the string connected with the bell-pull , which it was the butler 's duty invariably to attach to the arm of his master 's chair previous to his last exit from the dining-room ; for , as Mr Witherington very truly observed , it was very uncomfortable to be obliged to get up and ring the bell : indeed , more than once Mr Witherington had calculated the advantages and disadvantages of having a daughter about eight years old who could ring bells , air the newspapers , and cut the leaves of a new novel .
Parsing [sent. 117 len. 30]: When , however , he called to mind that she could not always remain at that precise age , he decided that the balance of comfort was against it .
Parsing [sent. 118 len. 15]: Mr Witherington , having pulled the bell again , fell into a brown study .
Parsing [sent. 119 len. 86]: Mr Jonathan , the butler , made his appearance ; but observing that his master was occupied , he immediately stopped at the door , erect , motionless , and with a face as melancholy as if he was performing mute at the porch of some departed peer of the realm ; for it is an understood thing , that the greater the rank of the defunct the longer must be the face , and , of course , the better must be the pay .
Parsing [sent. 120 len. 45]: Now , as Mr Witherington is still in profound thought , and Mr Jonathan will stand as long as a hackney-coach horse , we will just leave them as they are , while we introduce the brief history of the latter to our readers .
Parsing [sent. 121 len. 30]: Jonathan Trapp has served as foot_boy _ , which term , we believe , is derived from those who are in that humble capacity receiving a _ quantum suff .
Parsing [sent. 122 len. 76]: _ of the application of the feet of those above them to increase the energy of their service ; then as foot_man _ ; which implies that they have been promoted to the more agreeable right of administering instead of receiving the above dishonourable applications ; and lastly , for promotion could go no higher in the family , he had been raised to the dignity of butler in the service of Mr Witherington senior .
Parsing [sent. 123 len. 60]: Jonathan then fell in love , for butlers are guilty of indiscretions as well as their masters : neither he nor his fair flame , who was a lady 's maid in another family , notwithstanding that they had witnessed the consequences of this error in others , would take warning ; they gave warning , and they married .
Parsing [sent. 124 len. 67]: Like most butlers and ladies ' maids who pair off , they set up a public-house ; and it is but justice to the lady 's maid to say , that she would have preferred an eating-house , but was overruled by Jonathan , who argued , that although people would drink when they were not dry , they never would eat unless they were hungry .
Parsing [sent. 125 len. 81]: Now , although there was truth in the observation , this is certain , that business did not prosper : it has been surmised that Jonathan 's tall , lank , lean figure injured his custom , as people are but too much inclined to judge of the goodness of the ale by the rubicund face and rotundity of the landlord ; and therefore inferred that there could be no good beer where mine host was the picture of famine .
Parsing [sent. 126 len. 47]: There certainly is much in appearances in this world ; and it appears that , in consequence of Jonathan 's cadaverous appearance , he very soon appeared in the _ Gazette _ ; but what ruined Jonathan in one profession procured him immediate employment in another .
Parsing [sent. 127 len. 49]: An appraiser , upholsterer , and undertaker , who was called in to value the fixtures , fixed his eye upon Jonathan , and knowing the value of his peculiarly lugubrious appearance , and having a half-brother of equal height , offered him immediate employment as a mute .
Parsing [sent. 128 len. 68]: Jonathan soon forgot to mourn his own loss of a few hundreds in his new occupation of mourning the loss of thousands ; and his erect , stiff , statue-like carriage , and long melancholy face , as he stood at the portals of those who had entered the portals of the next world , were but too often a sarcasm upon the grief of the inheritors .
Parsing [sent. 129 len. 15]: Even grief is worth nothing in this trafficking world unless it be paid for .
Parsing [sent. 130 len. 11]: Jonathan buried many , and at last buried his wife .
Parsing [sent. 131 len. 24]: So far all was well ; but at last he buried his master , the undertaker , which was not quite so desirable .
Parsing [sent. 132 len. 53]: Although Jonathan wept not , yet did he express mute sorrow as he marshalled him to his long home , and drank to his memory in a pot of porter as he returned from the funeral , perched , with many others , like carrion crows on the top of the hearse .
Parsing [sent. 133 len. 21]: And now Jonathan was thrown out of employment from a reason which most people would have thought the highest recommendation .
Parsing [sent. 134 len. 14]: Every undertaker refused to take him , because they could not match him .
Parsing [sent. 135 len. 50]: In this unfortunate dilemma , Jonathan thought of Mr Witherington junior ; he had served and he had buried Mr Witherington his father , and Lady Mary his mother ; he felt that he had strong claims for such variety of services , and he applied to the bachelor .
Parsing [sent. 136 len. 50]: Fortunately for Jonathan , Mr Witherington 's butler-incumbent was just about to commit the same folly as Jonathan had done before , and Jonathan was again installed , resolving in his own mind to lead his former life , and have nothing more to do with ladies ' maids .
Parsing [sent. 137 len. 51]: But from habit Jonathan still carried himself as a mute on all ordinary occasions -- never indulging in an approximation to mirth , except when he perceived that his master was in high spirits , and then rather from a sense of duty than from any real hilarity of heart .
Parsing [sent. 138 len. 54]: Jonathan was no mean scholar for his station in life , and during his service with the undertaker , he had acquired the English of all the Latin mottoes which are placed upon the hatchments ; and these mottoes , when he considered them as apt , he was very apt to quote .
Parsing [sent. 139 len. 22]: We left Jonathan standing at the door ; he had closed it , and the handle still remained in his hand .
Parsing [sent. 140 len. 35]: `` Jonathan , '' said Mr Witherington , after a long pause -- `` I wish to look at the last letter from New York , you will find it on my dressing-table . ''
Parsing [sent. 141 len. 15]: Jonathan quitted the room without reply , and made his reappearance with the letter .
Parsing [sent. 142 len. 25]: `` It is a long time that I have been expecting this vessel , Jonathan , '' observed Mr Witherington , unfolding the letter .
Parsing [sent. 143 len. 28]: `` Yes , sir , a long while ; _ tempus fugit _ , '' replied the butler in a low tone , half shutting his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 144 len. 43]: `` I hope to God no accident has happened , '' continued Mr Witherington : `` my poor little cousin and her twins e ` en now that I speak , they may be all at the bottom of the sea . ''
Parsing [sent. 145 len. 23]: `` Yes , sir , '' replied the butler ; `` the sea defrauds many an honest undertaker of his profits . ''
Parsing [sent. 146 len. 8]: `` By the blood of the Witheringtons !
Parsing [sent. 147 len. 22]: I may be left without an heir , and shall be obliged to marry , which would be very uncomfortable . ''
Parsing [sent. 148 len. 15]: `` Very little comfort , '' echoed Jonathan -- `` my wife is dead .
Parsing [sent. 149 len. 5]: In caelo quies . ''
Parsing [sent. 150 len. 38]: `` Well , we must hope for the best ; but this suspense is anything but comfortable , '' observed Mr Witherington , after looking over the contents of the letter for at least the twentieth time .
Parsing [sent. 151 len. 30]: `` That will do , Jonathan ; I 'll ring for coffee presently ; '' and Mr Witherington was again alone and with his eyes fixed upon the ceiling .
Parsing [sent. 152 len. 97]: A cousin of Mr Witherington , and a very great favourite -LRB- for Mr Witherington , having a large fortune , and not having anything to do with business , was courted by his relations -RRB- , had , to a certain degree , committed herself ; that is to say , that , notwithstanding the injunctions of her parents , she had fallen in love with a young lieutenant in a marching regiment , whose pedigree was but respectable , and whose fortune was anything but respectable , consisting merely of a subaltern 's pay .
Parsing [sent. 153 len. 49]: Poor men , unfortunately , always make love better than those who are rich , because , having less to care about , and not being puffed up with their own consequence , they are not so selfish and think much more of the lady than of themselves .
Parsing [sent. 154 len. 57]: Young ladies , also , who fall in love , never consider whether there is sufficient `` to make the pot boil '' -- probably because young ladies in love lose their appetites , and , not feeling inclined to eat at that time , they imagine that love will always supply the want of food .
Parsing [sent. 155 len. 52]: Now , we will appeal to the married ladies whether we are not right in asserting that , although the collation spread for them and their friends on the day of the marriage is looked upon with almost loathing , they do not find their appetites return with interest soon afterwards .
Parsing [sent. 156 len. 24]: This was precisely the case with Cecilia , or rather , Cecilia Templemore , for she had changed her name the day before .
Parsing [sent. 157 len. 50]: It was also the case with her husband , who always had a good appetite , even during his days of courtship ; and the consequence was , that the messman 's account , for they lived in barracks , was , in a few weeks , rather alarming .
Parsing [sent. 158 len. 65]: Cecilia applied to her family , who very kindly sent her word that she might starve ; but , the advice neither suiting her nor her husband , she then wrote to her cousin Antony , who sent her word that he would be most happy to receive them at his table , and that they should take up their abode in Finsbury Square .
Parsing [sent. 159 len. 71]: This was exactly what they wished ; but still there was a certain difficulty ; Lieutenant Templemore 's regiment was quartered in a town in Yorkshire , which was some trifling distance from Finsbury Square ; and to be at Mr Witherington 's dinner-table at six p.m. , with the necessity of appearing at parade every morning at nine a.m. , was a dilemma not to be got out of .
Parsing [sent. 160 len. 64]: Several letters were interchanged upon this knotty subject : and at last it was agreed that Mr Templemore should sell out , and come up to Mr Witherington with his pretty wife : he did so , and found that it was much more comfortable to turn out at nine o'clock in the morning to a good breakfast than to a martial parade .
Parsing [sent. 161 len. 62]: But Mr Templemore had an honest pride and independence of character which would not permit him to eat the bread of idleness , and after a sojourn of two months in most comfortable quarters , without a messman 's bill , he frankly stated his feelings to Mr Witherington , and requested his assistance to procure for himself an honourable livelihood .
Parsing [sent. 162 len. 49]: Mr Witherington , who had become attached to them both , would have remonstrated , observing that Cecilia was his own cousin , and that he was a confirmed bachelor ; but , in this instance , Mr Templemore was firm , and Mr Witherington very unwillingly consented .
Parsing [sent. 163 len. 18]: A mercantile house of the highest respectability required a partner who could superintend their consignments to America .
Parsing [sent. 164 len. 23]: Mr Witherington advanced the sum required ; and , in a few weeks , Mr and Mrs Templemore sailed for New York .
Parsing [sent. 165 len. 30]: Mr Templemore was active and intelligent ; their affairs prospered ; and , in a few years , they anticipated a return to their native soil with a competence .
Parsing [sent. 166 len. 48]: But the autumn of the second year after their arrival proved very sickly ; the yellow fever raged ; and among the thousands who were carried off , Mr Templemore was a victim , about three weeks after his wife had been brought to bed of twins .
Parsing [sent. 167 len. 16]: Mrs Templemore rose from her couch a widow and the mother of two fine boys .
Parsing [sent. 168 len. 39]: The loss of Mr Templemore was replaced by the establishment with which he was connected , and Mr Witherington offered to his cousin that asylum which , in her mournful and unexpected bereavement , she so much required .
Parsing [sent. 169 len. 62]: In three months her affairs were arranged ; and with her little boys hanging at the breasts of two negro nurses , -- for no others could be procured who would undertake the voyage , -- Mrs Templemore , with Coco as male servant , embarked on board of the good ship _ Circassian _ , A1 , bound to Liverpool .
Parsing [sent. 170 len. 3]: CHAPTER THREE .
Parsing [sent. 171 len. 3]: THE GALE .
Parsing [sent. 172 len. 65]: Those who , standing on the pier , had witnessed the proud bearing of the _ Circassian _ as she gave her canvas to the winds , little contemplated her fate : still less did those on board ; for confidence is the characteristic of seamen , and they have the happy talent of imparting their confidence to whomsoever may be in their company .
Parsing [sent. 173 len. 16]: We shall pass over the voyage , confining ourselves to a description of the catastrophe .
Parsing [sent. 174 len. 46]: It was during a gale from the north-west , which had continued for three days , and by which the _ Circassian _ had been driven into the Bay of Biscay , that at about twelve o'clock at night , a slight lull was perceptible .
Parsing [sent. 175 len. 16]: The captain , who had remained on deck , sent down for the chief mate .
Parsing [sent. 176 len. 28]: `` Oswald , '' said Captain Ingram , `` the gale is breaking , and I think before morning we shall have had the worst of it .
Parsing [sent. 177 len. 19]: I shall lie down for an hour or two ; call me if there be any change . ''
Parsing [sent. 178 len. 26]: Oswald Bareth , a tall , sinewy-built , and handsome specimen of transatlantic growth , examined the whole circumference of the horizon before he replied .
Parsing [sent. 179 len. 53]: At last his eyes were steadily fixed to leeward : `` I 've a notion not , sir , '' said he ; `` I see no signs of clearing off to leeward : only a lull for relief , and a fresh hand at the bellows , depend upon it . ''
Parsing [sent. 180 len. 26]: `` We have now had it three days , '' replied Captain Ingram , `` and that 's the life of a summer gale . ''
Parsing [sent. 181 len. 20]: `` Yes , '' rejoined the mate ; `` but always provided that it do n't blow back again .
Parsing [sent. 182 len. 28]: I do n't like the look of it , sir ; and have it back we shall , as sure as there 's snakes in Virginny . ''
Parsing [sent. 183 len. 18]: `` Well , so be if so be , '' was the safe reply of the captain .
Parsing [sent. 184 len. 27]: `` You must keep a sharp look out , Bareth , and do n't leave the deck to call me ; send a hand down . ''
Parsing [sent. 185 len. 7]: The captain descended to his cabin .
Parsing [sent. 186 len. 61]: Oswald looked at the compass in the binnacle -- spoke a few words to the man at the helm -- gave one or two terrible kicks in the ribs to some of the men who were caulking -- sounded the pump-well -- put a fresh quid of tobacco into his cheek , and then proceeded to examine the heavens above .
Parsing [sent. 187 len. 31]: A cloud , much darker and more descending than the others , which obscured the firmament , spread over the zenith , and based itself upon the horizon to leeward .
Parsing [sent. 188 len. 36]: Oswald 's eye had been fixed upon it but a few seconds , when he beheld a small lambent gleam of lightning pierce through the most opaque part ; then another , and more vivid .
Parsing [sent. 189 len. 17]: Of a sudden the wind lulled , and the _ Circassian _ righted from her careen .
Parsing [sent. 190 len. 35]: Again the wind howled , and again the vessel was pressed down to her bearings by its force : again another flash of lightning , which was followed by a distant peal of thunder .
Parsing [sent. 191 len. 13]: `` Had the worst of it , did you say , captain ?
Parsing [sent. 192 len. 21]: I 've a notion that the worst is yet to come , '' muttered Oswald , still watching the heavens .
Parsing [sent. 193 len. 11]: `` How does she carry her helm , Matthew ? ''
Parsing [sent. 194 len. 6]: inquired Oswald , walking aft .
Parsing [sent. 195 len. 5]: `` Spoke a-weather . ''
Parsing [sent. 196 len. 18]: `` I 'll have the trysail off her , at any rate , '' continued the mate .
Parsing [sent. 197 len. 7]: `` Aft , there my lads !
Parsing [sent. 198 len. 6]: and lower down the trysail .
Parsing [sent. 199 len. 21]: Keep the sheet fast till it 's down , or the flogging will frighten the lady-passenger out of her wits .
Parsing [sent. 200 len. 17]: Well , if ever I own a craft , I 'll have no women on board .
Parsing [sent. 201 len. 7]: Dollars sha n't tempt me . ''
Parsing [sent. 202 len. 24]: The lightning now played in rapid forks ; and the loud thunder , which instantaneously followed each flash , proved its near approach .
Parsing [sent. 203 len. 31]: A deluge of slanting rain descended -- the wind lulled -- roared again -- then lulled -- shifted a point or two , and the drenched and heavy sails flapped .
Parsing [sent. 204 len. 9]: `` Up with the helm , Mat ! ''
Parsing [sent. 205 len. 26]: cried Oswald , as a near flash of lightning for a moment blinded , and the accompanying peal of thunder deafened , those on deck .
Parsing [sent. 206 len. 16]: Again the wind blew strong -- it ceased , and it was a dead calm .
Parsing [sent. 207 len. 37]: The sails hung down from the yards , and the rain descended in perpendicular torrents , while the ship rocked to and fro in the trough of the sea , and the darkness became suddenly intense .
Parsing [sent. 208 len. 8]: `` Down there , one of you !
Parsing [sent. 209 len. 9]: and call the captain , '' said Oswald .
Parsing [sent. 210 len. 5]: `` By the Lord !
Parsing [sent. 211 len. 5]: we shall have it .
Parsing [sent. 212 len. 11]: Main braces there , men , and square the yards .
Parsing [sent. 213 len. 3]: Be smart !
Parsing [sent. 214 len. 19]: That topsail should have been in , '' muttered the mate ; `` but I 'm not captain .
Parsing [sent. 215 len. 9]: Square away the yards , my lads ! ''
Parsing [sent. 216 len. 8]: continued he ; `` quick , quick !
Parsing [sent. 217 len. 10]: -- there 's no child 's play here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 218 len. 99]: Owing to the difficulty of finding and passing the ropes to each other , from the intensity of the darkness , and the deluge of rain which blinded them , the men were not able to execute the order of the mate so soon as it was necessary ; and before they could accomplish their task , or Captain Ingram could gain the deck , the wind suddenly burst upon the devoted vessel from the quarter directly opposite to that from which the gale had blown , taking her all a-back , and throwing her on her beam-ends .
Parsing [sent. 219 len. 61]: The man at the helm was hurled over the wheel ; while the rest , who were with Oswald at the main-bits , with the coils of ropes , and every other article on deck not secured , were rolled into the scuppers , struggling to extricate themselves from the mass of confusion and the water in which they floundered .
Parsing [sent. 220 len. 49]: The sudden revulsion awoke all the men below , who imagined that the ship was foundering ; and , from the only hatchway not secured , they poured up in their shirts with their other garments in their hands , to put them on -- if fate permitted .
Parsing [sent. 221 len. 12]: Oswald Bareth was the first who clambered up from to leeward .
Parsing [sent. 222 len. 11]: He gained the helm , which he put hard up .
Parsing [sent. 223 len. 12]: Captain Ingram and some of the seamen also gained the helm .
Parsing [sent. 224 len. 99]: It is the rendezvous of all good seamen in emergencies of this description : but the howling of the gale -- the blinding of the rain and salt spray -- the seas checked in their running by the shift of wind , and breaking over the ship in vast masses of water -- the tremendous peals of thunder -- and the intense darkness which accompanied these horrors , added to the inclined position of the vessel , which obliged them to climb from one part of the deck to another , for some time checked all profitable communication .
Parsing [sent. 225 len. 79]: Their only friend , in this conflict of the elements , was the lightning -LRB- unhappy , indeed , the situation in which lightning can be welcomed as a friend -RRB- ; but its vivid and forked flames , darting down upon every quarter of the horizon , enabled them to perceive their situation ; and , awful as it was , when momentarily presented to their sight , it was not so awful as darkness and uncertainty .
Parsing [sent. 226 len. 58]: To those who have been accustomed to the difficulties and dangers of a sea-faring life , there are no lines which speak more forcibly to the imagination , or prove the beauty and power of the Greek poet , than those in the noble prayer of Ajax : `` Lord of earth and air , O king !
Parsing [sent. 227 len. 3]: O father !
Parsing [sent. 228 len. 5]: hear my humble prayer .
Parsing [sent. 229 len. 44]: Dispel this cloud , that light of heaven restore ; Give me to see -- and Ajax asks no more , If Greece must perish -- we Thy will obey ; But _ let us perish in the face of day _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 230 len. 30]: Oswald gave the helm to two of the seamen , and with his knife cut adrift the axes , which were lashed round the mizen-mast in painted canvas covers .
Parsing [sent. 231 len. 22]: One he retained for himself , -- the others he put into the hands of the boatswain and the second mate .
Parsing [sent. 232 len. 50]: To speak so as to be heard was almost impossible , from the tremendous roaring of the wind ; but the lamp still burned in the binnacle , and by its feeble light Captain Ingram could distinguish the signs made by the mate , and could give his consent .
Parsing [sent. 233 len. 22]: It was necessary that the ship should be put before the wind ; and the helm had no power over her .
Parsing [sent. 234 len. 68]: In a short time the lanyards of the mizen rigging were severed , and the mizen-mast went over the side , almost unperceived by the crew on the other parts of the deck , or even those near , had it not been from blows received by those who were too close to it , from the falling of the topsail-sheets and the rigging about the mast .
Parsing [sent. 235 len. 19]: Oswald , with his companions , regained the binnacle , and for a little while watched the compass .
Parsing [sent. 236 len. 17]: The ship did not pay off , and appeared to settle down more into the water .
Parsing [sent. 237 len. 14]: Again Oswald made his signs , and again the captain gave his assent .
Parsing [sent. 238 len. 30]: Forward sprang the undaunted mate , clinging to the bulwark and belaying-pins , and followed by his hardy companions , until they had all three gained the main channels .
Parsing [sent. 239 len. 45]: Here , their exposure to the force of the breaking waves , and the stoutness of the ropes yielding but slowly to the blows of the axes , which were used almost under water , rendered the service one of extreme difficulty and danger .
Parsing [sent. 240 len. 23]: The boatswain was washed over the bulwark and dashed to leeward , where the lee-rigging only saved him from a watery grave .
Parsing [sent. 241 len. 15]: Unsubdued , he again climbed up to windward , rejoined and assisted his companions .
Parsing [sent. 242 len. 25]: The last blow was given by Oswald -- the lanyards flew through the dead-eyes -- and the tall mast disappeared in the foaming seas .
Parsing [sent. 243 len. 29]: Oswald and his companions hastened from their dangerous position , and rejoined the captain , who , with many of the crew , still remained near the wheel .
Parsing [sent. 244 len. 9]: The ship now slowly paid off and righted .
Parsing [sent. 245 len. 33]: In a few minutes she was flying before the gale , rolling heavily , and occasionally striking upon the wrecks of the masts , which she towed with her by the lee-rigging .
Parsing [sent. 246 len. 33]: Although the wind blew with as much violence as before , still it was not with the same noise , now that the ship was before the wind with her after-masts gone .
Parsing [sent. 247 len. 50]: The next service was to clear the ship of the wrecks of the masts ; but , although all now assisted , but little could be effected until the day had dawned , and even then it was a service of danger , as the ship rolled gunwale under .
Parsing [sent. 248 len. 52]: Those who performed the duty were slung in ropes , that they might not be washed away ; and hardly was it completed , when a heavy roll , assisted by a jerking heave from a sea which struck her on the chess-tree , sent the foremast over the starboard cathead .
Parsing [sent. 249 len. 11]: Thus was the _ Circassian _ dismasted in the gale .
Parsing [sent. 250 len. 3]: CHAPTER FOUR .
Parsing [sent. 251 len. 3]: THE LEAK .
Parsing [sent. 252 len. 23]: The wreck of the foremast was cleared from the ship ; the gale continued , but the sun shone brightly and warmly .
Parsing [sent. 253 len. 11]: The _ Circassian _ was again brought to the wind .
Parsing [sent. 254 len. 31]: All danger was now considered to be over , and the seamen joked and laughed as they were busied in preparing jury-masts to enable them to reach their destined port .
Parsing [sent. 255 len. 32]: `` I would n't have cared so much about this spree , '' said the boatswain , `` if it war n't for the mainmast ; it was such a beauty .
Parsing [sent. 256 len. 20]: There 's not another stick to be found equal to it in the whole length of the Mississippi . ''
Parsing [sent. 257 len. 3]: `` Bah !
Parsing [sent. 258 len. 57]: man , '' replied Oswald ; `` there 's as good fish in the sea as ever came out of it , and as good sticks growing as ever were felled ; but I guess we 'll pay pretty dear for our spars when we get to Liverpool , -- but that concerns the owners . ''
Parsing [sent. 259 len. 46]: The wind , which , at the time of its sudden change to the southward and eastward , had blown with the force of a hurricane , now settled into a regular strong gale , such as sailors are prepared to meet and laugh at .
Parsing [sent. 260 len. 19]: The sky was also bright and clear , and they had not the danger of a lee shore .
Parsing [sent. 261 len. 40]: It was a delightful change after a night of darkness , danger , and confusion and the men worked that they might get sufficient sail on the ship to steady her , and enable them to shape a course .
Parsing [sent. 262 len. 33]: `` I suppose now that we have the trysail on her forward , the captain will be for running for it , '' observed one who was busy turning in a dead-eye .
Parsing [sent. 263 len. 29]: `` Yes , '' replied the boatswain ; `` and with this wind on our quarter we sha n't want much sail , I 've a notion . ''
Parsing [sent. 264 len. 22]: `` Well , then , one advantage in losing your mast -- you have n't much trouble about the rigging . ''
Parsing [sent. 265 len. 37]: `` Trouble enough , though , Bill , when we get in , '' replied another , gruffly ; `` new lower rigging to parcel and sarve , and every block to turn in afresh . ''
Parsing [sent. 266 len. 14]: `` Never mind , longer in port -- I 'll get spliced . ''
Parsing [sent. 267 len. 14]: `` Why , how often do you mean to get spliced , Bill ?
Parsing [sent. 268 len. 14]: You 've a wife in every State , to my sartin knowledge . ''
Parsing [sent. 269 len. 12]: `` I ai n't got one at Liverpool , Jack . ''
Parsing [sent. 270 len. 27]: `` Well , you may take one there , Bill ; for you 've been sweet upon that nigger girl for these last three weeks . ''
Parsing [sent. 271 len. 16]: `` Any port in a storm , but she wo n't do for harbour duty .
Parsing [sent. 272 len. 45]: But the fact is , you 're all wrong there , Jack , its the babbies I likes -- I likes to see them both together , hanging at the niggers ' breasts , I always think of two spider-monkeys nursing two kittens . ''
Parsing [sent. 273 len. 13]: `` I knows the women , but I never knows the children .
Parsing [sent. 274 len. 19]: It 's just six of one and half-a-dozen of the other ; ai n't it , Bill ? ''
Parsing [sent. 275 len. 13]: `` Yes ; like two bright bullets out of the same mould .
Parsing [sent. 276 len. 15]: I say , Bill , did any of your wives ever have twins ? ''
Parsing [sent. 277 len. 18]: `` No ; nor I do n't intend , until the owners give us double pay . ''
Parsing [sent. 278 len. 48]: `` By-the-bye , '' interrupted Oswald , who had been standing under the weather bulk-head , listening to the conversation , and watching the work in progress , `` we may just as well see if she has made any water with all this straining and buffeting .
Parsing [sent. 279 len. 9]: By the Lord I never thought of that .
Parsing [sent. 280 len. 12]: Carpenter , lay down your adze and sound the well . ''
Parsing [sent. 281 len. 28]: The carpenter , who , notwithstanding the uneasiness of the dismasted vessel , was performing his important share of the work , immediately complied with the order .
Parsing [sent. 282 len. 32]: He drew up the rope-yarn , to which an iron rule had been suspended , and lowered down into the pump-well , and perceived that the water was dripping from it .
Parsing [sent. 283 len. 51]: Imagining that it must have been wet from the quantity of water shipped over all , the carpenter disengaged the rope-yarn from the rule , drew another from the junk lying on the deck , which the seamen were working up , and then carefully proceeded to plumb the well .
Parsing [sent. 284 len. 32]: He hauled it up , and , looking at it for some moments aghast , exclaimed , '' _ Seven feet _ of water in the hold , by God . ''
Parsing [sent. 285 len. 44]: If the crew of the _ Circassian _ , the whole of which were on deck , had been struck with an electric shock , the sudden change of their countenances could not have been greater than was produced by this appalling intelligence .
Parsing [sent. 286 len. 40]: Heap upon sailors every disaster , every danger which can be accumulated from the waves , the wind , the elements , or the enemy , and they will bear up against them with a courage amounting to heroism .
Parsing [sent. 287 len. 76]: All that they demand is , that the one plank `` between them and death '' is sound , and they will trust to their own energies , and will be confident in their own skill : but _ spring a leak _ and they are half paralysed ; and if it gain upon them they are subdued ; for when they find that their exertions are futile , they are little better than children .
Parsing [sent. 288 len. 13]: Oswald sprang to the pumps when he heard the carpenter 's report .
Parsing [sent. 289 len. 24]: `` Try again , Abel -- it can not be : cut away that line ; hand us here a dry rope-yarn . ''
Parsing [sent. 290 len. 16]: Once more the well was sounded by Oswald , and the result was the same .
Parsing [sent. 291 len. 40]: `` We must rig the pumps , my lads , '' said the mate , endeavouring to conceal his own fears ; `` half this water must have found its way in when she was on her beam-ends . ''
Parsing [sent. 292 len. 64]: This idea , so judiciously thrown out , was caught at by the seamen , who hastened to obey the order , while Oswald went down to acquaint the captain , who , worn out with watching and fatigue , had , now that danger was considered to be over , thrown himself into his cot to obtain a few hours ' repose .
Parsing [sent. 293 len. 15]: `` Do you think , Bareth , that we have sprung a leak ? ''
Parsing [sent. 294 len. 19]: said the captain , earnestly , `` She never could have taken in that quantity of water . ''
Parsing [sent. 295 len. 26]: `` Never , sir , '' replied the mate ; `` but she has been so strained , that she may have opened her top-sides .
Parsing [sent. 296 len. 8]: I trust it is no worse . ''
Parsing [sent. 297 len. 9]: `` What is your opinion , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 298 len. 57]: `` I am afraid that the wrecks of the masts have injured her : you may recollect how often we struck against them before we could clear ourselves of them ; once , particularly , the mainmast appeared to be right under her bottom , I recollect , and she struck very heavy on it . ''
Parsing [sent. 299 len. 21]: `` Well , it is God 's will : let us get on deck as fast as we can . ''
Parsing [sent. 300 len. 30]: When they arrived on deck , the carpenter walked up to the captain , and quietly said to him , '' _ Seven feet three , sir _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 301 len. 35]: The pumps were then in full action ; the men had divided , by the direction of the boatswain , and , stripped naked to the waist , relieved each other every two minutes .
Parsing [sent. 302 len. 8]: For half an hour they laboured incessantly .
Parsing [sent. 303 len. 45]: This was the half-hour of suspense : the great point to be ascertained was , whether she leaked through the top-sides , and had taken in the water during the second gale ; if so , there was every hope of keeping it under .
Parsing [sent. 304 len. 33]: Captain Ingram and the mate remained in silence near the capstan , the former with his watch in his hand , during the time that the sailors exerted themselves to the utmost .
Parsing [sent. 305 len. 30]: It was ten minutes past seven when the half hour had expired ; the well was sounded and the line carefully measured -- _ Seven feet six inches _ !
Parsing [sent. 306 len. 23]: So that the water had gained upon them , notwithstanding that they had plied the pumps to the utmost of their strength .
Parsing [sent. 307 len. 21]: A mute look of despair was exchanged among the crew , but it was followed up by curses and execrations .
Parsing [sent. 308 len. 10]: Captain Ingram remained silent , with his lips compressed .
Parsing [sent. 309 len. 9]: `` It 's all over with us ! ''
Parsing [sent. 310 len. 6]: exclaimed one of the men .
Parsing [sent. 311 len. 17]: `` Not yet , my lads ; we have one more chance , '' said Oswald .
Parsing [sent. 312 len. 57]: `` I 've a notion that the ship 's sides have been opened by the infernal straining of last night , and that she is now taking it in at the top-sides generally : if so , we have only to put her before the wind again , and have another good spell at the pumps .
Parsing [sent. 313 len. 24]: When no longer strained , as she is now with her broadside to the sea , she will close all up again . ''
Parsing [sent. 314 len. 28]: `` I should n't wonder if Mr Bareth is not right , '' replied the carpenter ; `` however , that 's my notion , too . ''
Parsing [sent. 315 len. 9]: `` And mine , '' added Captain Ingram .
Parsing [sent. 316 len. 6]: `` Come , my men !
Parsing [sent. 317 len. 12]: never say die while there 's a shot in the locker .
Parsing [sent. 318 len. 7]: Let 's try her again . ''
Parsing [sent. 319 len. 34]: And , to encourage the men , Captain Ingram threw off his coat and assisted at the first spell , while Oswald went to the helm and put the ship before the wind .
Parsing [sent. 320 len. 27]: As the _ Circassian _ rolled before the gale , the lazy manner in which she righted proved how much water there was in the hold .
Parsing [sent. 321 len. 23]: The seamen exerted themselves for a whole hour without intermission , and the well was again sounded -- _ eight feet _ !
Parsing [sent. 322 len. 41]: The men did not assert that they would pump no longer ; but they too plainly showed their intentions by each resuming in silence his shirt and jacket , which had been taken off at the commencement of his exertions .
Parsing [sent. 323 len. 10]: `` What 's to be done , Oswald ? ''
Parsing [sent. 324 len. 9]: said Captain Ingram , as they walked aft .
Parsing [sent. 325 len. 21]: `` You see the men will pump no longer : nor , indeed , would it be of any use .
Parsing [sent. 326 len. 5]: We are doomed . ''
Parsing [sent. 327 len. 34]: `` The _ Circassian _ is , sir , I am afraid , '' replied the mate : `` pumping is of no avail ; they could not keep her afloat till day-break .
Parsing [sent. 328 len. 24]: We must therefore , trust to our boats , which I believe to be all sound , and quit her before night . ''
Parsing [sent. 329 len. 11]: `` Crowded boats in such a sea as this ! ''
Parsing [sent. 330 len. 9]: replied Captain Ingram , shaking his head mournfully .
Parsing [sent. 331 len. 15]: `` Are bad enough , I grant ; but better than the sea itself .
Parsing [sent. 332 len. 52]: All we can do now is to try and keep the men sober , and if we can do so it will be better than to fatigue them uselessly ; they 'll want all their strength before they put foot again upon dry land -- if ever they are so fortunate .
Parsing [sent. 333 len. 7]: Shall I speak to them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 334 len. 28]: `` Do , Oswald , '' replied the captain ; `` for myself I care little , God knows ; but my wife -- my children ! ''
Parsing [sent. 335 len. 44]: `` My lads , '' said Oswald , going forward to the men , who had waited in moody silence the result of the conference -- `` as for pumping any longer it would be only wearing out your strength for no good .
Parsing [sent. 336 len. 19]: We must now look to our boats ; and a good boat is better than a bad ship .
Parsing [sent. 337 len. 29]: Still this gale and cross-running sea are rather too much for boats at present ; we had therefore better stick to the ship as long as we can .
Parsing [sent. 338 len. 39]: Let us set to with a will and get the boats ready , with provisions , water , and what may be needful , and then we must trust to God 's mercy and our own endeavours . ''
Parsing [sent. 339 len. 15]: `` No boat can stand this sea , '' observed one of the men .
Parsing [sent. 340 len. 24]: `` I 'm of opinion , as it 's to be a short life , it may as well be a merry one .
Parsing [sent. 341 len. 8]: What d'ye say , my lads ? ''
Parsing [sent. 342 len. 8]: continued he , appealing to the men .
Parsing [sent. 343 len. 80]: Several of the crew were of the same opinion : but Oswald , stepping forward , seized one of the axes which lay at the main-bits , and going up to the seaman who had spoken , looked him steadfastly in the face : -- `` Williams , '' said the mate , `` a short life it may be to all of us , but not a merry one ; the meaning of which I understand very well .
Parsing [sent. 344 len. 44]: Sorry I shall be to have your blood , or that of others , on my hands ; but as sure as there 's a heaven , I 'll cleave to the shoulder the first man who attempts to break into the spirit-room .
Parsing [sent. 345 len. 6]: You know I never joke .
Parsing [sent. 346 len. 4]: Shame upon you !
Parsing [sent. 347 len. 37]: Do you call yourselves men , when , for the sake of a little liquor now , you would lose your only chance of getting drunk every day as soon as we get on shore again ?
Parsing [sent. 348 len. 22]: There 's a time for all things ; and I 've a notion this is a time to be sober . ''
Parsing [sent. 349 len. 23]: As most of the crew sided with Oswald , the weaker party were obliged to submit , and the preparations were commenced .
Parsing [sent. 350 len. 14]: The two boats on the booms were found to be in good condition .
Parsing [sent. 351 len. 29]: One party was employed cutting away the bulwarks , that the boats might be launched over the side , as there were no means of hoisting them out .
Parsing [sent. 352 len. 6]: The well was again sounded .
Parsing [sent. 353 len. 15]: Nine feet of water in the hold , and the ship evidently settling fast .
Parsing [sent. 354 len. 37]: Two hours had now passed , and the gale was not so violent ; the sea , also , which at the change of wind had been cross , appeared to have recovered its regular run .
Parsing [sent. 355 len. 43]: All was ready ; the sailors , once at work again , had , in some measure , recovered their spirits , and were buoyed up with fresh hopes at the slight change in their favour from the decrease of the wind .
Parsing [sent. 356 len. 57]: The two boats were quite large enough to contain the whole of the crew and passengers ; but , as the sailors said among themselves -LRB- proving the kindness of their hearts -RRB- , `` What was to become of those two poor babbies , in an open boat for days and nights , perhaps ? ''
Parsing [sent. 357 len. 48]: Captain Ingram had gone down to Mrs Templemore , to impart to her their melancholy prospects ; and the mother 's heart , as well as the mother 's voice , echoed the words of the seamen , `` What will become of my poor babes ? ''
Parsing [sent. 358 len. 33]: It was not till nearly six o'clock in the evening that all was ready : the ship was slowly brought to the wind again , and the boats launched over the side .
Parsing [sent. 359 len. 25]: By this time the gale was much abated ; but the vessel was full of water , and was expected soon to go down .
Parsing [sent. 360 len. 26]: There is no time in which coolness and determination are more required than in a situation like the one which we have attempted to describe .
Parsing [sent. 361 len. 59]: It is impossible to know the precise moment at which a water-logged vessel , in a heavy sea , may go down : and its occupants are in a state of mental fever , with the idea of their remaining in her so late that she will suddenly submerge , and leave them to struggle in the waves .
Parsing [sent. 362 len. 22]: This feeling actuated many of the crew of the _ Circassian _ , and they had already retreated to the boats .
Parsing [sent. 363 len. 33]: All was arranged ; Oswald had charge of one boat , and it was agreed that the larger should receive Mrs Templemore and her children , under the protection of Captain Ingram .
Parsing [sent. 364 len. 31]: The number appointed to Oswald 's boat being completed , he shoved off , to make room for the other , and laid-to to leeward , waiting to keep company .
Parsing [sent. 365 len. 17]: Mrs Templemore came up with Captain Ingram , and was assisted by him into the boat .
Parsing [sent. 366 len. 100]: The nurse , with one child , was at last placed by her side ; Coco was leading Judy , the other nurse , with the remaining infant in her arms , and Captain Ingram , who had been obliged to go into the boat with the first child , was about to return to assist Judy with the other , when the ship gave a heavy pitch , and her forecastle was buried in the wave : at the same time the gunwale of the boat was stove by coming in contact with the side of the vessel .
Parsing [sent. 367 len. 9]: `` She 's down , by God ! ''
Parsing [sent. 368 len. 16]: exclaimed the alarmed seamen in the boat ; shoving off to escape from the vortex .
Parsing [sent. 369 len. 47]: Captain Ingram , who was standing on the boat 's thwarts to assist Judy , was thrown back into the bottom of the boat ; and , before he could extricate himself , the boat was separated from the ship , and had drifted to leeward .
Parsing [sent. 370 len. 5]: `` My child ! ''
Parsing [sent. 371 len. 9]: screamed the mother : `` my child ! ''
Parsing [sent. 372 len. 9]: `` Pull to again , my lads ! ''
Parsing [sent. 373 len. 8]: cried Captain Ingram , seizing the tiller .
Parsing [sent. 374 len. 52]: The men , who had been alarmed at the idea that the ship was going down , now that they saw that she was still afloat , got out the oars and attempted to regain her , but in vain -- they could not make head against the sea and wind .
Parsing [sent. 375 len. 25]: Further and further did they drift to leeward , notwithstanding their exertions ; while the frantic mother extended her arms , imploring and entreating .
Parsing [sent. 376 len. 19]: Captain Ingram , who had stimulated the sailors to the utmost , perceived that further attempts were useless .
Parsing [sent. 377 len. 4]: `` My child !
Parsing [sent. 378 len. 4]: my child ! ''
Parsing [sent. 379 len. 16]: screamed Mrs Templemore , standing up , and holding out her arms towards the vessel .
Parsing [sent. 380 len. 16]: At a sign from the captain , the head of the boat was veered round .
Parsing [sent. 381 len. 20]: The bereaved mother knew that all hope was gone , and she fell down in a state of insensibility .
Parsing [sent. 382 len. 3]: CHAPTER FIVE .
Parsing [sent. 383 len. 4]: THE OLD MAID .
Parsing [sent. 384 len. 66]: One morning , shortly after the disasters which we have described , Mr Witherington descended to his breakfast-room somewhat earlier than usual , and found his green morocco easy-chair already tenanted by no less a personage than William the footman , who , with his feet on the fender , was so attentively reading the newspaper that he did not hear his master 's entrance .
Parsing [sent. 385 len. 11]: `` By my ancestor , who fought on his stumps !
Parsing [sent. 386 len. 24]: but I hope you are quite comfortable , Mr William ; nay , I beg I may not disturb you , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 387 len. 17]: William , although as impudent as most of his fraternity , was a little taken aback .
Parsing [sent. 388 len. 21]: `` I beg your pardon , sir , but Mr Jonathan had not time to look over the paper . ''
Parsing [sent. 389 len. 17]: `` Nor is it required that he should , that I know of , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 390 len. 31]: `` Mr Jonathan says , sir , that it is always right to look over the _ deaths _ , that news of that kind may not shock you . ''
Parsing [sent. 391 len. 7]: `` Very considerate , indeed . ''
Parsing [sent. 392 len. 15]: `` And there is a story there , sir , about a shipwreck . ''
Parsing [sent. 393 len. 4]: `` A shipwreck !
Parsing [sent. 394 len. 4]: where , William ?
Parsing [sent. 395 len. 4]: God bless me !
Parsing [sent. 396 len. 5]: where is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 397 len. 28]: `` I am afraid it is the same ship you are so anxious about , sir , -- the -- I forget the name , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 398 len. 35]: Mr Witherington took the newspaper , and his eye soon caught the paragraph in which the rescue of the two negroes and child from the wreck of the _ Circassian _ was fully detailed .
Parsing [sent. 399 len. 6]: `` It is indeed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 400 len. 4]: exclaimed Mr Witherington .
Parsing [sent. 401 len. 9]: `` My poor Cecilia in an open boat !
Parsing [sent. 402 len. 19]: one of the boats was seen to go down , -- perhaps she 's dead -- merciful God !
Parsing [sent. 403 len. 4]: one boy saved .
Parsing [sent. 404 len. 4]: Mercy on me !
Parsing [sent. 405 len. 5]: where 's Jonathan ? ''
Parsing [sent. 406 len. 46]: `` Here , sir , '' replied Jonathan , very solemnly , who had just brought in the eggs , and now stood erect as a mute behind his master 's chair , for it was a case of danger , if not of death .
Parsing [sent. 407 len. 20]: `` I must go to Portsmouth immediately after breakfast -- sha n't eat though -- appetite all gone . ''
Parsing [sent. 408 len. 16]: `` People seldom do , sir , on these melancholy occasions , '' replied Jonathan .
Parsing [sent. 409 len. 16]: `` Will you take your own carriage , sir , or a mourning coach ? ''
Parsing [sent. 410 len. 16]: `` A mourning coach at fourteen miles an hour , with two pair of horses !
Parsing [sent. 411 len. 7]: Jonathan , you 're crazy . ''
Parsing [sent. 412 len. 23]: `` Will you please to have black silk hatbands and gloves for the coachman and servants who attend you , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 413 len. 5]: `` Confound your shop !
Parsing [sent. 414 len. 27]: no ; this is a resurrection , not a death ; it appears that the negro thinks only one of the boats went down . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 415 len. 15]: _ Mors omnia vincit _ , '' quoth Jonathan , casting up his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 416 len. 11]: `` Never you mind that ; mind your own business .
Parsing [sent. 417 len. 15]: That 's the postman 's knock -- see if there are any letters . ''
Parsing [sent. 418 len. 75]: There were several ; and amongst the others there was one from Captain Maxwell , of the _ Eurydice _ , detailing the circumstances already known , and informing Mr Witherington that he had despatched the two negroes and the child to his address by that day 's coach , and that one of the officers , who was going to town by the same conveyance , would see them safe to his house .
Parsing [sent. 419 len. 38]: Captain Maxwell was an old acquaintance of Mr Witherington -- had dined at his house in company with the Templemores , and therefore had extracted quite enough information from the negroes to know where to direct them .
Parsing [sent. 420 len. 8]: `` By the blood of my ancestors !
Parsing [sent. 421 len. 20]: they 'll be here to night , '' cried Mr Witherington ; `` and I have saved my journey .
Parsing [sent. 422 len. 6]: What is to be done ?
Parsing [sent. 423 len. 13]: better tell Mary to get rooms ready : d'ye hear , William ?
Parsing [sent. 424 len. 10]: beds for one little boy and two niggers . ''
Parsing [sent. 425 len. 21]: `` Yes , sir , '' replied William ; `` but where are the black people to be put ? ''
Parsing [sent. 426 len. 3]: `` Put !
Parsing [sent. 427 len. 17]: I do n't care ; one may sleep with cook , the other with Mary . ''
Parsing [sent. 428 len. 29]: `` Very well , sir , I 'll tell them , '' replied William , hastening away , delighted at the row which he anticipated in the kitchen .
Parsing [sent. 429 len. 25]: `` If you please , sir , '' observed Jonathan , `` one of the negroes is , I believe , a man . ''
Parsing [sent. 430 len. 7]: `` Well , what then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 431 len. 15]: `` Only , sir , the maids may object to sleep with him . ''
Parsing [sent. 432 len. 9]: `` By all the plagues of the Witheringtons !
Parsing [sent. 433 len. 19]: this is true ; well , you may take him , Jonathan -- you like that colour . ''
Parsing [sent. 434 len. 15]: `` Not in the dark , sir , '' replied Jonathan with a bow .
Parsing [sent. 435 len. 17]: `` Well , then , let them sleep together : so that affair is settled . ''
Parsing [sent. 436 len. 10]: `` Are they man and wife , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 437 len. 4]: said the butler .
Parsing [sent. 438 len. 7]: `` The devil take them both !
Parsing [sent. 439 len. 5]: how should I know ?
Parsing [sent. 440 len. 16]: Let me have my breakfast , and we 'll talk over the matter by-and-by . ''
Parsing [sent. 441 len. 57]: Mr Witherington applied to his eggs , and muffin , eating his breakfast as fast as he could , without knowing why ; but the reason was that he was puzzled and perplexed with the anticipated arrival , and longed to think quietly over the dilemma , for it was a dilemma to an old bachelor .
Parsing [sent. 442 len. 40]: As soon as he had swallowed his second cup of tea he put himself into his easy-chair , in an easy attitude , and was very soon soliloquising as follows : -- `` By the blood of the Witheringtons !
Parsing [sent. 443 len. 33]: what am I , an old bachelor , to do with a baby , and a wet-nurse as black as the ace of spades , and another black fellow in the bargain .
Parsing [sent. 444 len. 5]: Send him back again ?
Parsing [sent. 445 len. 30]: yes , that 's best : but the child -- woke every morning at five o'clock with its squalling -- obliged to kiss it three times a-day -- pleasant !
Parsing [sent. 446 len. 54]: -- and then that nigger of a nurse -- thick lips -- kissing child all day , and then holding it out to me -- ignorant as a cow -- if child has the stomach-ache she 'll cram a pepper-pod down its throat -- West India fashion -- children never without the stomach-ache !
Parsing [sent. 447 len. 7]: -- my poor , poor cousin !
Parsing [sent. 448 len. 13]: -- what has become of her and the other child , too ?
Parsing [sent. 449 len. 11]: -- wish they may pick her up , poor dear !
Parsing [sent. 450 len. 41]: and then she will come and take care of her own children -- do n't know what to do -- great mind to send for sister Moggy -- but she 's so fussy -- wo n't be in a hurry .
Parsing [sent. 451 len. 4]: Think again . ''
Parsing [sent. 452 len. 12]: Here Mr Witherington was interrupted by two taps at the door .
Parsing [sent. 453 len. 37]: `` Come in , '' said he ; and the cook , with her face as red as if she had been dressing a dinner for eighteen , made her appearance without the usual clean apron .
Parsing [sent. 454 len. 26]: `` If you please , sir , '' said she , curtseying , `` I will thank you to suit yourself with another cook . ''
Parsing [sent. 455 len. 16]: `` Oh , very well , '' replied Mr Witherington , angry at the interruption .
Parsing [sent. 456 len. 27]: `` And if you please , sir , I should like to go this very day -- indeed , sir , I shall not stay . ''
Parsing [sent. 457 len. 6]: `` Go to the devil !
Parsing [sent. 458 len. 24]: if you please , '' replied Mr Witherington , angrily ; `` but first go out and shut the door after you . ''
Parsing [sent. 459 len. 11]: The cook retired , and Mr Witherington was again alone .
Parsing [sent. 460 len. 13]: `` Confound the old woman -- what a huff she is in !
Parsing [sent. 461 len. 17]: wo n't cook for black people , I suppose -- yes , that 's it . ''
Parsing [sent. 462 len. 15]: Here Mr Witherington was again interrupted by a second double tap at the door .
Parsing [sent. 463 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 464 len. 8]: thought better of it , I suppose .
Parsing [sent. 465 len. 4]: Come in . ''
Parsing [sent. 466 len. 15]: It was not the cook , but Mary , the housemaid , that entered .
Parsing [sent. 467 len. 23]: `` If you please , sir , '' said she , whimpering , `` I should wish to leave my situation . ''
Parsing [sent. 468 len. 7]: `` A conspiracy , by heavens !
Parsing [sent. 469 len. 7]: Well , you may go . ''
Parsing [sent. 470 len. 14]: `` To-night , sir , if you please , '' answered the woman .
Parsing [sent. 471 len. 10]: `` This moment , for all I care ! ''
Parsing [sent. 472 len. 7]: exclaimed Mr Witherington in his wrath .
Parsing [sent. 473 len. 14]: The housemaid retired ; and Mr Witherington took some time to compose himself .
Parsing [sent. 474 len. 46]: `` Servants all going to the devil in this country , '' said he at last ; `` proud fools -- wo n't clean rooms after black people , I suppose -- yes , that 's it , confound them all , black and white !
Parsing [sent. 475 len. 13]: here 's my whole establishment upset by the arrival of a baby .
Parsing [sent. 476 len. 12]: Well , it is very uncomfortable -- what shall I do ?
Parsing [sent. 477 len. 6]: -- send for sister Moggy ?
Parsing [sent. 478 len. 10]: -- no , I 'll send for Jonathan . ''
Parsing [sent. 479 len. 12]: Mr Witherington rang the bell , and Jonathan made his appearance .
Parsing [sent. 480 len. 9]: `` What is all this , Jonathan ? ''
Parsing [sent. 481 len. 21]: said he ; `` cook angry -- Mary crying -- both going away -- what 's it all about ? ''
Parsing [sent. 482 len. 43]: `` Why , sir , they were told by William that it was your positive order that the two black people were to sleep with them ; and I believe he told Mary that the man was to sleep with her . ''
Parsing [sent. 483 len. 5]: `` Confound that fellow !
Parsing [sent. 484 len. 17]: he 's always at mischief ; you know , Jonathan , I never meant that . ''
Parsing [sent. 485 len. 19]: `` I thought not , sir , as it is quite contrary to custom , '' replied Jonathan .
Parsing [sent. 486 len. 19]: `` Well , then , tell them so , and let 's hear no more about it . ''
Parsing [sent. 487 len. 20]: Mr Witherington then entered into a consultation with his butler , and acceded to the arrangements proposed by him .
Parsing [sent. 488 len. 12]: The parties arrived in due time , and were properly accommodated .
Parsing [sent. 489 len. 33]: Master Edward was not troubled with the stomach-ache , neither did he wake Mr Witherington at five o'clock in the morning ; and , after all , it was not very uncomfortable .
Parsing [sent. 490 len. 82]: But , although things were not quite so uncomfortable as Mr Witherington had anticipated , still they were not comfortable ; and Mr Witherington was so annoyed by continual skirmishes with his servants , complaints from Judy , in bad English , of the cook , who , it must be owned , had taken a prejudice against her and Coco , occasional illness of the child , et cetera , that he found his house no longer quiet and peaceable .
Parsing [sent. 491 len. 44]: Three months had now nearly passed , and no tidings of the boats had been received ; and Captain Maxwell , who came up to see Mr Witherington , gave it as his decided opinion that they must have foundered in the gale .
Parsing [sent. 492 len. 54]: As , therefore , there appeared to be no chance of Mrs Templemore coming to take care of her child , Mr Witherington at last resolved to write to Bath , where his sister resided , and acquaint her with the whole story , requesting her to come and superintend his domestic concerns .
Parsing [sent. 493 len. 18]: A few days afterwards he received the following reply : -- '' _ Bath , August _ .
Parsing [sent. 494 len. 57]: `` My dear Brother Antony , `` Your letter arrived safe to hand on Wednesday last , and I must say that I was not a little surprised at its contents ; indeed , I thought so much about it that I revoked at Lady Betty Blabkin 's whist-party , and lost four shillings and sixpence .
Parsing [sent. 495 len. 23]: You say that you have a child at your house belonging to your cousin , who married in so indecorous a manner .
Parsing [sent. 496 len. 45]: I hope what you say is true ; but , at the same time , I know what bachelors are guilty of ; although , as Lady Betty says , it is better never to talk or even to hint about these improper things .
Parsing [sent. 497 len. 45]: I can not imagine why men should consider themselves , in an unmarried state , as absolved from that purity which maidens are so careful to preserve ; and so says Lady Betty , with whom I had a little conversation on the subject .
Parsing [sent. 498 len. 27]: As , however , the thing is done , she agrees with me that it is better to hush it up as well as we can .
Parsing [sent. 499 len. 47]: `` I presume that you do not intend to make the child your heir , which I should consider as highly improper ; and , indeed , Lady Betty tells me that the legacy-duty is ten per cent , and that it can not be avoided .
Parsing [sent. 500 len. 16]: However , I make it a rule never to talk about these sort of things .
Parsing [sent. 501 len. 52]: As for your request that I will come up and superintend your establishment , I have advised with Lady Betty on the subject , and she agrees with me that , for the honour of the family , it is better that I should come , as it will save appearances .
Parsing [sent. 502 len. 25]: You are in a peck of troubles , as most men are who are free-livers and are led astray by artful and alluring females .
Parsing [sent. 503 len. 17]: However , as Lady Betty says , ` the least said , the soonest mended . '
Parsing [sent. 504 len. 42]: `` I will , therefore , make the necessary arrangements for letting my house , and hope to join you in about ten days ; sooner , I can not , as I find that my engagements extend to that period .
Parsing [sent. 505 len. 97]: Many questions have already been put to me on this unpleasant subject ; but I always give but one answer , which is , that bachelors will be bachelors ; and that , at all events , it is not so bad as if you were a married man : for I make it a rule never to talk about , or even to hint about , these sort of things , for , as Lady Betty says , ` Men will get into scrapes , and the sooner things are hushed up the better . '
Parsing [sent. 506 len. 14]: So no more at present from your affectionate sister , `` Margaret Witherington .
Parsing [sent. 507 len. 3]: `` PS .
Parsing [sent. 508 len. 45]: Lady Betty and I both agree that you are very right in hiring two black people to bring the child into your house , as it makes the thing look _ foreign _ to the neighbours , and we can keep our own secrets .
Parsing [sent. 509 len. 28]: `` M.W. '' `` Now , by all the sins of the Witheringtons , if this is not enough to drive a man out of his senses !
Parsing [sent. 510 len. 7]: -- Confound the suspicious old maid !
Parsing [sent. 511 len. 10]: I 'll not let her come into this house .
Parsing [sent. 512 len. 12]: Confound Lady Betty , and all scandal-loving old tabbies like her !
Parsing [sent. 513 len. 4]: Bless me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 514 len. 23]: continued Mr Witherington , throwing the letter on the table with a deep sigh , `` this is anything but comfortable . ''
Parsing [sent. 515 len. 21]: But if Mr Witherington found it anything but comfortable at the commencement , he found it unbearable in the sequel .
Parsing [sent. 516 len. 32]: His sister Moggy arrived , and installed herself in the house with all the pomp and protecting air of one who was the saviour of her brother 's reputation and character .
Parsing [sent. 517 len. 53]: When the child was first brought down to her , instead of perceiving at once its likeness to Mr Templemore , which was very strong , she looked at it and at her brother 's face with her only eye , and shaking her finger , exclaimed -- `` Oh , Antony !
Parsing [sent. 518 len. 2]: Antony !
Parsing [sent. 519 len. 8]: and did you expect to deceive me ?
Parsing [sent. 520 len. 13]: -- the nose -- the mouth exact -- Antony , for shame !
Parsing [sent. 521 len. 6]: fie , for shame ! ''
Parsing [sent. 522 len. 18]: But we must hurry over the misery that Mr Witherington 's kindness and benevolence brought upon him .
Parsing [sent. 523 len. 20]: Not a day passed -- scarcely an hour , without his ears being galled with his sister 's insinuations .
Parsing [sent. 524 len. 44]: Judy and Coco were sent back to America ; the servants , who had remained so long in his service , gave warning one by one , and afterwards , were changed as often almost as there was a change in the moon .
Parsing [sent. 525 len. 32]: She ruled the house and her brother despotically ; and all poor Mr Witherington 's comfort was gone until the time arrived when Master Edward was to be sent to school .
Parsing [sent. 526 len. 27]: Mr Witherington then plucked up courage , and after a few stormy months drove his sister back to Bath , and once more found himself comfortable .
Parsing [sent. 527 len. 69]: Edward came home during the holidays , and was a great favourite ; but the idea had become current that he was the son of the old gentleman , and the remarks made were so unpleasant and grating to him , that he was not sorry , much as he was attached to the boy , when he declared his intention to choose the profession of a sailor .
Parsing [sent. 528 len. 42]: Captain Maxwell introduced him into the service ; and afterwards , when , in consequence of ill health and exhaustion , he was himself obliged to leave it for a time , he procured for his _ protege _ other ships .
Parsing [sent. 529 len. 47]: We must , therefore , allow some years to pass away , during which time Edward Templemore pursues his career , Mr Witherington grows older and more particular , and his sister Moggy amuses herself with Lady Betty 's remarks and her darling game of whist .
Parsing [sent. 530 len. 44]: During all this period no tidings of the boats , or of Mrs Templemore and her infant , had been heard ; it was therefore naturally conjectured that they had all perished , and they were remembered but as things that had been .
Parsing [sent. 531 len. 3]: CHAPTER SIX .
Parsing [sent. 532 len. 3]: THE MIDSHIPMAN .
Parsing [sent. 533 len. 67]: The weather side of the quarter-deck of H.M. frigate _ Unicorn _ was occupied by two very great personages : Captain Plumbton , commanding the ship , who was very great in width if not in height , taking much more than his allowance of the deck , if it were not that he was the proprietor thereof , and entitled to the lion 's share .
Parsing [sent. 534 len. 40]: Captain P was not more than four feet ten inches in height ; but then he was equal to that in girth : there was quite enough of him , if he had only been _ rolled out _ .
Parsing [sent. 535 len. 32]: He walked with his coat flying open , his thumbs stuck into the arm holes of his waistcoat , so as to throw his shoulders back and increase his horizontal dimensions .
Parsing [sent. 536 len. 17]: He also held his head well aft , which threw his chest and stomach well forward .
Parsing [sent. 537 len. 20]: He was the prototype of pomposity and good nature , and he strutted like an actor in a procession .
Parsing [sent. 538 len. 18]: The other personage was the first lieutenant , whom Nature had pleased to fashion in another mould .
Parsing [sent. 539 len. 18]: He was as tall as the captain was short -- as thin as his superior was corpulent .
Parsing [sent. 540 len. 46]: His long , lanky legs were nearly up to the captain 's shoulders ; and he bowed down over the head of his superior , as if he were the crane to hoist up , and the captain the bale of goods to be hoisted .
Parsing [sent. 541 len. 34]: He carried his hands behind his back , with two fingers twisted together ; and his chief difficulty appeared to be to reduce his own stride to the parrot march of the captain .
Parsing [sent. 542 len. 20]: His features were sharp and lean as was his body , and wore every appearance of a cross-grained temper .
Parsing [sent. 543 len. 18]: He had been making divers complaints of divers persons , and the captain had hitherto appeared imperturbable .
Parsing [sent. 544 len. 15]: Captain Plumbton was an even-tempered man , who was satisfied with a good dinner .
Parsing [sent. 545 len. 16]: Lieutenant Markitall was an odd-tempered man , who would quarrel with his bread and butter .
Parsing [sent. 546 len. 21]: `` Quite impossible , sir , '' continued the first-lieutenant , `` to carry on the duty without support . ''
Parsing [sent. 547 len. 35]: This oracular observation , which , from the relative forms of the two parties , descended as it were from above , was replied to by the captain with a `` Very true . ''
Parsing [sent. 548 len. 23]: `` Then , sir , I presume you will not object to my putting that man in the report for punishment ? ''
Parsing [sent. 549 len. 11]: `` I 'll think about it , Mr Markitall . ''
Parsing [sent. 550 len. 15]: This , with Captain Plumbton , was as much as to say , No .
Parsing [sent. 551 len. 18]: `` The young gentlemen , sir , I am sorry to say , are very troublesome . ''
Parsing [sent. 552 len. 10]: `` Boys always are , '' replied the captain .
Parsing [sent. 553 len. 21]: `` Yes sir : but the duty must be carried on , and I can not do without them . ''
Parsing [sent. 554 len. 10]: `` Very true -- midshipmen are very useful . ''
Parsing [sent. 555 len. 15]: `` But I am sorry to say , sir , that they are not .
Parsing [sent. 556 len. 22]: Now sir , there 's Mr Templemore ; I can do nothing with him -- he does nothing but laugh . ''
Parsing [sent. 557 len. 3]: `` Laugh !
Parsing [sent. 558 len. 11]: -- Mr Markitall , does he laugh at you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 559 len. 12]: `` Not exactly , sir ; but he laughs at everything .
Parsing [sent. 560 len. 48]: If I send him to the mast-head , he goes up laughing ; if I call him down , he comes down laughing ; if I find fault with him , he laughs the next minute : in fact , sir , he does nothing but laugh .
Parsing [sent. 561 len. 32]: I should particularly wish , sir , that you would speak to him , and see if any interference on your part -- '' `` Would make him cry -- eh ?
Parsing [sent. 562 len. 9]: better to laugh than cry in this world .
Parsing [sent. 563 len. 9]: Does he never cry , Mr Markitall ? ''
Parsing [sent. 564 len. 9]: `` Yes , sir , and very unseasonably .
Parsing [sent. 565 len. 80]: The other day , you may recollect , when you punished Wilson the marine , whom I appointed to take care of his chest and hammock , he was crying the whole time ; almost tantamount -- at least an indirect species of mutiny on his part , as it implied -- '' `` That the boy was sorry that his servant was punished ; I never flog a man but I 'm sorry myself , Mr Markitall . ''
Parsing [sent. 566 len. 36]: `` Well , I do not press the question of his crying -- that I might look over ; but his laughing , sir , I must beg that you will take notice of that .
Parsing [sent. 567 len. 11]: Here he is , sir , coming up the hatchway .
Parsing [sent. 568 len. 12]: Mr Templemore , the captain wishes to speak to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 569 len. 29]: Now the captain did not wish to speak to him , but , forced upon him as it was by the first-lieutenant , he could do no less .
Parsing [sent. 570 len. 48]: So Mr Templemore touched his hat , and stood before the captain , we regret to say , with such a good-humoured , sly , confiding smirk on his countenance , as at once established the proof of the accusation , and the enormity of the offence .
Parsing [sent. 571 len. 33]: `` So , sir , '' said Captain Plumbton , stopping in his perambulation , and squaring his shoulders still more , `` I find that you laugh at the first-lieutenant . ''
Parsing [sent. 572 len. 6]: `` I , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 573 len. 12]: replied the boy , the smirk expanding into a broad grin .
Parsing [sent. 574 len. 30]: `` Yes ; you , sir , '' said the first-lieutenant , now drawing up to his full height ; `` why you 're laughing now , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 575 len. 33]: `` I ca n't help it , sir -- it 's not my fault ; and I 'm sure it 's not yours , sir , '' added the boy , demurely .
Parsing [sent. 576 len. 24]: `` Are you aware , Edward -- Mr Templemore , I mean -- of the impropriety of disrespect to your superior officer ? ''
Parsing [sent. 577 len. 28]: `` I never laughed at Mr Markitall but once , sir , that I can recollect , and that was when he tumbled over the messenger . ''
Parsing [sent. 578 len. 13]: `` And why did you laugh at him then , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 579 len. 26]: `` I always do laugh when any one tumbles down , '' replied the lad ; `` I ca n't help it , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 580 len. 20]: `` Then , sir , I suppose you would laugh if you saw me rolling in the lee-scuppers ? ''
Parsing [sent. 581 len. 4]: said the captain .
Parsing [sent. 582 len. 4]: `` Oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 583 len. 32]: replied the boy , no longer able to contain himself , `` I 'm sure I should burst myself with laughing -- I think I see you now , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 584 len. 6]: `` Do you , indeed !
Parsing [sent. 585 len. 26]: I 'm very glad that you do not ; though I 'm afraid , young gentleman , you stand convicted by your own confession . ''
Parsing [sent. 586 len. 25]: `` Yes , sir , for laughing , if that is any crime ; but it 's not in the Articles of War . ''
Parsing [sent. 587 len. 9]: `` No , sir ; but disrespect is .
Parsing [sent. 588 len. 10]: You laugh when you go to the mast-head . ''
Parsing [sent. 589 len. 19]: `` But I obey the order , sir , immediately -- Do I not , Mr Markitall ? ''
Parsing [sent. 590 len. 29]: `` Yes , sir , you obey the order ; but , at the same time , your laughing proves that you do not mind the punishment . ''
Parsing [sent. 591 len. 8]: `` No more I do , sir .
Parsing [sent. 592 len. 18]: I spend half my time at the mast-head , and I 'm used to it now . ''
Parsing [sent. 593 len. 18]: `` But , Mr Templemore , ought you not to feel the disgrace of the punishment ? ''
Parsing [sent. 594 len. 6]: inquired the captain , severely .
Parsing [sent. 595 len. 14]: `` Yes , sir , if I felt I deserved it I should .
Parsing [sent. 596 len. 27]: I should not laugh , sir , if _ you _ sent me to the mast-head , '' replied the boy , assuming a serious countenance .
Parsing [sent. 597 len. 18]: `` You see , Mr Markitall , that he can be grave , '' observed the captain .
Parsing [sent. 598 len. 42]: `` I 've tried all I can to make him so , sir , '' replied the first-lieutenant ; `` but I wish to ask Mr Templemore what he means to imply by saying , ` when he deserves it . '
Parsing [sent. 599 len. 14]: Does he mean to say that I have ever punished him unjustly ? ''
Parsing [sent. 600 len. 38]: `` Yes , sir , '' replied the boy , boldly ; `` five times out of six , I am mast-headed for nothing -- and that 's the reason why I do not mind it . ''
Parsing [sent. 601 len. 6]: `` For nothing , sir !
Parsing [sent. 602 len. 7]: Do you call laughing nothing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 603 len. 40]: `` I pay every attention that I can to my duty , sir ; I always obey your orders ; I try all I can to make you pleased with me -- but you are always punishing me . ''
Parsing [sent. 604 len. 22]: `` Yes , sir , for laughing , and , what is worse , making the ship 's company laugh . ''
Parsing [sent. 605 len. 25]: `` They ` haul and hold ' just the same , sir -- I think they work all the better for being merry . ''
Parsing [sent. 606 len. 14]: `` And pray , sir , what business have you to think ? ''
Parsing [sent. 607 len. 8]: replied the first-lieutenant , now very angry .
Parsing [sent. 608 len. 36]: `` Captain Plumbton , as this young gentleman thinks proper to interfere with me and the discipline of the ship , I beg you will see what effect your punishing may have upon him . ''
Parsing [sent. 609 len. 36]: `` Mr Templemore , '' said the captain , `` you are , in the first place , too free in your speech , and , in the next place , too fond of laughing .
Parsing [sent. 610 len. 25]: There is , Mr Templemore , a time for all things -- a time to be merry , and a time to be serious .
Parsing [sent. 611 len. 11]: The quarter-deck is not a fit place for mirth . ''
Parsing [sent. 612 len. 15]: `` I 'm sure the gangway is not , '' shrewdly interrupted the boy .
Parsing [sent. 613 len. 27]: `` No -- you are right , nor the gangway ; but you may laugh on the forecastle , and when below with your messmates . ''
Parsing [sent. 614 len. 21]: `` No , sir , we may not ; Mr Markitall always sends out if he hears us laughing . ''
Parsing [sent. 615 len. 12]: `` Because , Mr Templemore , you 're always laughing . ''
Parsing [sent. 616 len. 26]: `` I believe I am , sir ; and if it 's wrong I 'm sorry to displease you , but I mean no disrespect .
Parsing [sent. 617 len. 53]: I laugh in my sleep -- I laugh when I awake -- I laugh when the sun shines -- I always feel so happy ; but though you do mast-head me , Mr Markitall , I should not laugh , but be very sorry , if any misfortune happened to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 618 len. 20]: `` I believe you would , boy -- I do indeed , Mr Markitall , '' said the captain .
Parsing [sent. 619 len. 44]: `` Well , sir , '' replied the first-lieutenant , `` as Mr Templemore appears to be aware of his error , I do not wish to press my complaint -- I have only to request that he will never laugh again . ''
Parsing [sent. 620 len. 26]: `` You hear , boy , what the first-lieutenant says ; it 's very reasonable , and I beg I may hear no more complaints .
Parsing [sent. 621 len. 25]: Mr Markitall , let me know when the foot of that foretopsail will be repaired -- I should like to shift it to-night . ''
Parsing [sent. 622 len. 12]: Mr Markitall went down under the half-deck to make the inquiry .
Parsing [sent. 623 len. 42]: `` And , Edward , '' said Captain Plumbton , as soon as the lieutenant was out of ear-shot , `` I have a good deal more to say to you upon this subject , but I have no time now .
Parsing [sent. 624 len. 21]: So come and dine with me -- at my table , you know , I allow laughing in moderation . ''
Parsing [sent. 625 len. 17]: The boy touched his hat , and with a grateful , happy countenance , walked away .
Parsing [sent. 626 len. 21]: We have introduced this little scene , that the reader may form some idea of the character of Edward Templemore .
Parsing [sent. 627 len. 32]: He was indeed the soul of mirth , good-humour , and kindly feelings towards others ; he even felt kindly towards the first-lieutenant , who persecuted him for his risible propensities .
Parsing [sent. 628 len. 27]: We do not say that the boy was right in laughing at all times , or that the first-lieutenant was wrong in attempting to check it .
Parsing [sent. 629 len. 35]: As the captain said , there is a time for all things , and Edward 's laugh was not always seasonable ; but it was his nature , and he could not help it .
Parsing [sent. 630 len. 42]: He was joyous as the May morning ; and thus he continued for years , laughing at everything -- pleased with everybody -- almost universally liked -- and his bold , free , and happy spirit unchecked by vicissitude or hardship .
Parsing [sent. 631 len. 84]: He served his time -- was nearly turned back when he was passing his examination for laughing , and then went laughing to sea again -- was in command of a boat at the cutting-out of a French corvette , and when on board was so much amused by the little French captain skipping about with his rapier , which proved fatal to many , that at last he received a pink from the little gentleman himself , which laid him on deck .
Parsing [sent. 632 len. 83]: For this affair , and in consideration of his wound , he obtained his promotion to the rank of lieutenant -- was appointed to a line-of-battle ship in the West Indies -- laughed at the yellow-fever -- was appointed to the tender of that ship , a fine schooner , and was sent to cruise for prize-money for the admiral , and promotion for himself , if he could , by any fortunate encounter , be so lucky as to obtain it .
Parsing [sent. 633 len. 3]: CHAPTER SEVEN .
Parsing [sent. 634 len. 4]: SLEEPER 'S BAY .
Parsing [sent. 635 len. 25]: On the western coast of Africa , there is a small bay , which has received more than one name from its occasional visitors .
Parsing [sent. 636 len. 71]: That by which it was designated by the adventurous Portuguese , who first dared to cleave the waves of the Southern Atlantic , has been forgotten with their lost maritime pre-eminence ; the name allotted to it by the woolly-headed natives of the coast has never , perhaps , been ascertained ; it is , however , marked down in some of the old English charts as Sleeper 's Bay .
Parsing [sent. 637 len. 81]: The mainland which , by its curvature , has formed this little dent on a coast possessing , and certainly at present requiring few harbours , displays , perhaps , the least inviting of all prospects ; offering to the view nothing but a shelving beach of dazzling white sand , backed with a few small hummocks beat up by the occasional fury of the Atlantic gales -- arid , bare , and without the slightest appearance of vegetable life .
Parsing [sent. 638 len. 49]: The inland prospect is shrouded over by a dense mirage , through which here and there are to be discovered the stems of a few distant palm-trees , so broken and disjoined by refraction that they present to the imagination anything but the idea of foliage or shade .
Parsing [sent. 639 len. 102]: The water in the bay is calm and smooth as the polished mirror ; not the smallest ripple is to be heard on the beach , to break through the silence of nature ; not a breath of air sweeps over its glassy surface , which is heated with the intense rays of a vertical noonday sun , pouring down a withering flood of light and heat : not a sea-bird is to be discovered wheeling on its flight , or balancing on its wings as it pierces the deep with its searching eye , ready to dart upon its prey .
Parsing [sent. 640 len. 40]: All is silence , solitude , and desolation , save that occasionally may be seen the fin of some huge shark , either sluggishly moving through the heated element , or stationary in the torpor of the mid-day heat .
Parsing [sent. 641 len. 51]: A site so sterile , so stagnant , so little adapted to human life , can not well be conceived , unless , by flying to extremes , we were to portray the chilling blast , the transfixing cold , and `` close-ribbed ice , '' at the frozen poles .
Parsing [sent. 642 len. 72]: At the entrance of this bay , in about three fathoms water , heedless of the spring cable which hung down as a rope which had fallen overboard , there floated , motionless as death , a vessel whose proportions would have challenged the unanimous admiration of those who could appreciate the merits of her build , had she been anchored in the most frequented and busy harbour of the universe .
Parsing [sent. 643 len. 128]: So beautiful were her lines , that you might almost have imagined her a created being that the ocean had been ordered to receive , as if fashioned by the Divine Architect , to add to the beauty and variety of His works ; for , from the huge leviathan to the smallest of the finny tribe -- from the towering albatross to the boding petrel of the storm -- where could be found , among the winged or finned frequenters of the ocean , a form more appropriate , more fitting , than this specimen of human skill , whose beautiful model and elegant tapering spars were now all that could be discovered to break the meeting lines of the firmament and horizon of the offing .
Parsing [sent. 644 len. 2]: Alas !
Parsing [sent. 645 len. 26]: she was fashioned , at the will of avarice , for the aid of cruelty and injustice , and now was even more nefariously employed .
Parsing [sent. 646 len. 23]: She had been a slaver -- she was now the far-famed , still more dreaded , pirate-schooner , the _ Avenger _ .
Parsing [sent. 647 len. 63]: Not a man-of-war which scoured the deep but had her instructions relative to this vessel , which had been so successful in her career of crime -- not a trader in any portion of the navigable globe but whose crew shuddered at the mention of her name , and the remembrance of the atrocities which had been practised by her reckless crew .
Parsing [sent. 648 len. 30]: She had been everywhere -- in the east , the west , the north , and the south , leaving a track behind her of rapine and of murder .
Parsing [sent. 649 len. 48]: There she lay in motionless beauty ; her low sides were painted black , with one small , narrow riband of red -- her raking masts were clean scraped -- her topmasts , her cross-trees , caps , and even running-blocks , were painted in pure white .
Parsing [sent. 650 len. 43]: Awnings were spread fore and aft to protect the crew from the powerful rays of the sun ; her ropes were hauled taut ; and in every point she wore the appearance of being under the control of seamanship and strict discipline .
Parsing [sent. 651 len. 43]: Through the clear smooth water her copper shone brightly ; and as you looked over her taffrail down into the calm blue sea , you could plainly discover the sandy bottom beneath her and the anchor which then lay under her counter .
Parsing [sent. 652 len. 28]: A small boat floated astern , the weight of the rope which attached her appearing , in the perfect calm , to draw her towards the schooner .
Parsing [sent. 653 len. 31]: We must now go on board , and our first cause of surprise will be the deception relative to the tonnage of the schooner , when viewed from a distance .
Parsing [sent. 654 len. 45]: Instead of a small vessel of about ninety tons , we discover that she is upwards of two hundred ; that her breadth of beam is enormous ; and that those spars , which appeared so light and elegant , are of unexpected dimensions .
Parsing [sent. 655 len. 91]: Her decks are of narrow fir planks , without the least spring or rise ; her ropes are of Manilla hemp , neatly secured to copper belaying-pins , and coiled down on the deck , whose whiteness is well contrasted with the bright green paint of her bulwarks ; her capstern and binnacles are cased in fluted mahogany , and ornamented with brass ; metal stanchions protect the skylights , and the bright muskets are arranged in front of the mainmast , while the boarding-pikes are lashed round the mainboom .
Parsing [sent. 656 len. 66]: In the centre of the vessel , between the fore and main masts , there is a long brass 32-pounder fixed upon a carriage revolving in a circle , and so arranged that in bad weather it can be lowered down and _ housed _ ; while on each side of her decks are mounted eight brass guns of smaller calibre and of exquisite workmanship .
Parsing [sent. 657 len. 61]: Her build proves the skill of the architect ; her fitting-out , a judgment in which nought has been sacrificed to , although everything has been directed by , taste ; and her neatness and arrangement , that , in the person of her commander , to the strictest discipline there is united the practical knowledge of a thorough seaman .
Parsing [sent. 658 len. 17]: How , indeed , otherwise could she have so long continued her lawless yet successful career ?
Parsing [sent. 659 len. 37]: How could it have been possible to unite a crew of miscreants , who feared not God nor man , most of whom had perpetrated foul murders , or had been guilty of even blacker iniquities ?
Parsing [sent. 660 len. 19]: It was because he who commanded the vessel was so superior as to find in her no rivalry .
Parsing [sent. 661 len. 51]: Superior in talent , in knowledge of his profession , in courage , and , moreover , in physical strength -- which in him was almost Herculean -- unfortunately he was also superior to all in villainy , in cruelty , and contempt of all injunctions , moral and Divine .
Parsing [sent. 662 len. 14]: What had been the early life of this person was but imperfectly known .
Parsing [sent. 663 len. 88]: It was undoubted that he had received an excellent education , and it was said that he was of an ancient border family on the banks of the Tweed : by what chances he had become a pirate -- by what errors he had fallen from his station in society , until he became an outcast , had never been revealed ; it was only known that he had been some years employed in the slave-trade previous to his seizing this vessel and commencing his reckless career .
Parsing [sent. 664 len. 51]: The name by which he was known to the crew of the pirate-vessel was `` Cain , '' and well had he chosen this appellation ; for , had not his hand for more than three years been against every man 's , and every man 's hand against his ?
Parsing [sent. 665 len. 34]: In person he was about six feet high , with a breadth of shoulders and of chest denoting the utmost of physical force which , perhaps , has ever been allotted to man .
Parsing [sent. 666 len. 30]: His features would have been handsome had they not been scarred with wounds ; and , strange to say , his eye was mild and of a soft blue .
Parsing [sent. 667 len. 59]: His mouth was well formed , and his teeth of a pearly white : the hair of his head was crisped and wavy , and his beard , which he wore , as did every person composing the crew of the pirate , covered the lower part of his face in strong , waving , and continued curls .
Parsing [sent. 668 len. 17]: The proportions of his body were perfect ; but from their vastness they became almost terrific .
Parsing [sent. 669 len. 104]: His costume was elegant , and well adapted to his form : linen trousers , and untanned yellow leather boots , such as are made at the Western Isles ; a broad-striped cotton shirt ; a red Cashmere shawl round his waist as a sash ; a vest embroidered in gold tissue , with a jacket of dark velvet , and pendant gold buttons , hanging over his left shoulder , after the fashion of the Mediterranean seamen ; a round Turkish skull-cap , handsomely embroidered ; a pair of pistols , and a long knife in his sash , completed his attire .
Parsing [sent. 670 len. 42]: The crew consisted in all of 165 men , of almost every nation ; but it was to be remarked that all those in authority were either Englishmen or from the northern countries ; the others were chiefly Spaniards and Maltese .
Parsing [sent. 671 len. 33]: Still there were Portuguese , Brazilians , negroes , and others , who made up the complement , which at the time we now speak of was increased by twenty-five additional hands .
Parsing [sent. 672 len. 54]: These were Kroumen , a race of blacks well known at present , who inhabit the coast near Cape Palmas , and are often employed by our men-of-war stationed on the coast to relieve the English seamen from duties which would be too severe to those who were not inured to the climate .
Parsing [sent. 673 len. 27]: They are powerful , athletic men , good sailors , of a happy , merry disposition , and , unlike other Africans , will work hard .
Parsing [sent. 674 len. 29]: Fond of the English , they generally speak the language sufficiently to be understood , and are very glad to receive a baptism when they come on board .
Parsing [sent. 675 len. 62]: The name first given them they usually adhere to as long as they live ; and you will now on the coast meet with a Blucher , a Wellington , a Nelson , etcetera , who will wring swabs , or do any other of the meanest description of work , without feeling that it is discreditable to sponsorials so grand .
Parsing [sent. 676 len. 52]: It is not to be supposed that these men had voluntarily come on board of the pirate ; they had been employed in some British vessels trading on the coast , and had been taken out of them when the vessels were burnt , and the Europeans of the crews murdered .
Parsing [sent. 677 len. 31]: They had received a promise of reward , if they did their duty ; but , not expecting it , they waited for the earliest opportunity to make their escape .
Parsing [sent. 678 len. 61]: The captain of the schooner is abaft with his glass in his hand , occasionally sweeping the offing in expectation of a vessel heaving in sight : the officers and crew are lying down , or lounging listlessly , about the decks , panting with the extreme heat , and impatiently waiting for the sea-breeze to fan their parched foreheads .
Parsing [sent. 679 len. 25]: With their rough beards and exposed chests , and their weather-beaten fierce countenances , they form a group which is terrible even in repose .
Parsing [sent. 680 len. 11]: We must now descend into the cabin of the schooner .
Parsing [sent. 681 len. 80]: The fittings-up of this apartment are simple : on each side is a standing bed-place ; against the after bulkhead is a large buffet , originally intended for glass and china , but now loaded with silver and gold vessels of every size and description , collected by the pirate from the different ships which he had plundered ; the lamps are also of silver , and evidently had been intended to ornament the shrine of some Catholic saint .
Parsing [sent. 682 len. 19]: In this cabin there are two individuals , to whom we shall now direct the reader 's attention .
Parsing [sent. 683 len. 28]: The one is a pleasant-countenanced , good-humoured Krouman , who had been christened `` Pompey the Great ; '' most probably on account of his large proportions .
Parsing [sent. 684 len. 39]: He wears a pair of duck trousers ; the rest of his body is naked , and presents a sleek , glossy skin , covering muscle , which an anatomist or a sculptor would have viewed with admiration .
Parsing [sent. 685 len. 23]: The other is a youth of eighteen , or thereabouts , with an intelligent , handsome countenance , evidently of European blood .
Parsing [sent. 686 len. 42]: There is , however , an habitually mournful cast upon his features : he is dressed much in the same way as we have described the captain , but the costume hangs more gracefully upon his slender , yet well-formed limbs .
Parsing [sent. 687 len. 63]: He is seated on a sofa , fixed in the fore part of the cabin , with a book in his hand , which occasionally he refers to , and then lifts his eyes from , to watch the motions of the Krouman , who is busy in the office of steward , arranging and cleaning the costly articles in the buffet .
Parsing [sent. 688 len. 26]: `` Massa Francisco , dis really fine ting , '' said Pompey , holding up a splendidly embossed tankard , which he had been rubbing .
Parsing [sent. 689 len. 18]: `` Yes , '' replied Francisco , gravely ; `` it is , indeed , Pompey . ''
Parsing [sent. 690 len. 9]: `` How Captain Cain came by dis ? ''
Parsing [sent. 691 len. 26]: Francisco shook his head , and Pompey put his finger up to his mouth , his eyes , full of meaning , fixed upon Francisco .
Parsing [sent. 692 len. 13]: At this moment the personage referred to was heard descending the companion-ladder .
Parsing [sent. 693 len. 15]: Pompey recommenced rubbing the silver , and Francisco dropped his eyes upon the book .
Parsing [sent. 694 len. 66]: What was the tie which appeared to bind the captain to this lad was not known ; but , as the latter had always accompanied , and lived together with him , it was generally supposed that he was the captain 's son ; and he was as often designated by the crew as young Cain as he was by his Christian name of Francisco .
Parsing [sent. 695 len. 26]: Still it was observed that latterly they had frequently been heard in altercation , and that the captain was very suspicious of Francisco 's movements .
Parsing [sent. 696 len. 34]: `` I beg I may not interrupt your conversation , '' said Cain , on entering the cabin ; `` the information you may obtain from a Krouman must be very important . ''
Parsing [sent. 697 len. 13]: Francisco made no reply , but appeared to be reading his book .
Parsing [sent. 698 len. 17]: Cain 's eyes passed from one to the other , as if to read their thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 699 len. 11]: `` Pray what were you saying , Mr Pompey ? ''
Parsing [sent. 700 len. 7]: `` Me say , Massa Captain ?
Parsing [sent. 701 len. 22]: me only tell young Massa dis very fine ting ; ask where you get him -- Massa Francisco no tell . ''
Parsing [sent. 702 len. 14]: `` And what might it be to you , you black scoundrel ? ''
Parsing [sent. 703 len. 42]: cried the captain , seizing the goblet , and striking the man with it a blow on the head which flattened the vessel , and at the same time felled the Krouman , powerful as he was , to the deck .
Parsing [sent. 704 len. 18]: The blood streamed , as the man slowly rose , stupefied and trembling from the violent concussion .
Parsing [sent. 705 len. 45]: Without saying a word , he staggered out of the cabin , and Cain threw himself on one of the lockers in front of the standing bed-place , saying , with a bitter smile , `` So much for your intimates , Francisco ! ''
Parsing [sent. 706 len. 26]: `` Rather , so much for your cruelty and injustice towards an unoffending man , '' replied Francisco , laying his book on the table .
Parsing [sent. 707 len. 24]: `` His question was an innocent one , -- for he knew not the particulars connected with the obtaining of that flagon . ''
Parsing [sent. 708 len. 12]: `` And you , I presume , do not forget them ?
Parsing [sent. 709 len. 46]: Well , be it so , young man ; but I warn you again -- as I have warned you often -- nothing but the remembrance of your mother has prevented me , long before this , from throwing your body to the sharks . ''
Parsing [sent. 710 len. 36]: `` What influence my mother 's memory may have over you , I know not ; I only regret that , in any way , she had the misfortune to be connected with you . ''
Parsing [sent. 711 len. 37]: `` She had the influence , '' replied Cain , `` which a woman must have over a man when they have for years swung in the same cot ; but that is wearing off fast .
Parsing [sent. 712 len. 29]: I tell you so candidly ; I will not -LSB- even -RSB- allow even her memory to check me , if I find you continue your late course .
Parsing [sent. 713 len. 30]: You have shown disaffection before the crew -- you have disputed my orders -- and I have every reason to believe that you are now plotting against me . ''
Parsing [sent. 714 len. 35]: `` Can I do otherwise than show my abhorrence , '' replied Francisco , `` when I witness such acts of horror , of cruelty -- cold-blooded cruelty , as lately have been perpetrated ?
Parsing [sent. 715 len. 7]: Why do you bring me here ?
Parsing [sent. 716 len. 8]: and why do you now detain me ?
Parsing [sent. 717 len. 15]: All I ask is , that you will allow me to leave the vessel .
Parsing [sent. 718 len. 13]: You are not my father ; you have told me so . ''
Parsing [sent. 719 len. 19]: `` No , I am not your father ; but -- you are your mother 's son . ''
Parsing [sent. 720 len. 31]: `` That gives you no right to have power over me , even if you had been married to my mother ; which -- '' `` I was not . ''
Parsing [sent. 721 len. 17]: `` I thank God ; for marriage with you would have been even greater disgrace . ''
Parsing [sent. 722 len. 4]: `` What ! ''
Parsing [sent. 723 len. 40]: cried Cain , starting up , seizing the young man by the neck , and lifting him off his seat as if he had been a puppet ; `` but no -- I can not forget your mother . ''
Parsing [sent. 724 len. 12]: Cain released Francisco , and resumed his seat on the locker .
Parsing [sent. 725 len. 49]: `` As you please , '' said Francisco , as soon as he had recovered himself ; `` it matters little whether I am brained by your own hand , or launched overboard as a meal for the sharks ; it will be but one more murder . ''
Parsing [sent. 726 len. 4]: `` Mad fool !
Parsing [sent. 727 len. 8]: why do you tempt me thus ? ''
Parsing [sent. 728 len. 13]: replied Cain , again starting up , and hastily quitting the cabin .
Parsing [sent. 729 len. 31]: The altercation which we have just described was not unheard on deck , as the doors of the cabin were open , and the skylight removed to admit the air .
Parsing [sent. 730 len. 12]: The face of Cain was flushed as he ascended the ladder .
Parsing [sent. 731 len. 41]: He perceived his chief mate standing by the hatchway , and many of the men , who had been slumbering abaft , with their heads raised on their elbows , as if they had been listening to the conversation below .
Parsing [sent. 732 len. 19]: `` It will never do , sir , '' said Hawkhurst , the mate , shaking his head .
Parsing [sent. 733 len. 17]: `` No , '' replied the captain ; `` not if he were my own son .
Parsing [sent. 734 len. 7]: But what is to be done ?
Parsing [sent. 735 len. 7]: -- he knows no fear . ''
Parsing [sent. 736 len. 7]: Hawkhurst pointed to the entering port .
Parsing [sent. 737 len. 21]: `` When I ask your advice , you may give it , '' said the captain , turning gloomily away .
Parsing [sent. 738 len. 12]: In the meantime , Francisco paced the cabin in deep thought .
Parsing [sent. 739 len. 21]: Young as he was , he was indifferent to death ; for he had no tie to render life precious .
Parsing [sent. 740 len. 17]: He remembered his mother , but not her demise ; that had been concealed from him .
Parsing [sent. 741 len. 22]: At the age of seven he had sailed with Cain in a slaver , and had ever since continued with him .
Parsing [sent. 742 len. 16]: Until lately , he had been led to suppose that the captain was his father .
Parsing [sent. 743 len. 52]: During the years that he had been in the slave-trade , Cain had devoted much time to his education ; it so happened that the only book which could be found on board of the vessel , when Cain first commenced teaching , was a Bible belonging to Francisco 's mother .
Parsing [sent. 744 len. 21]: Out of this book he learned to read ; and , as his education advanced , other books were procured .
Parsing [sent. 745 len. 55]: It may appear strange that the very traffic in which his reputed father was engaged did not corrupt the boy 's mind , but , accustomed to it from his infancy , he had considered these negroes as another species , -- an idea fully warranted by the cruelty of the Europeans towards them .
Parsing [sent. 746 len. 27]: There are some dispositions so naturally kind and ingenuous that even example and evil contact can not debase them : such was the disposition of Francisco .
Parsing [sent. 747 len. 44]: As he gained in years and knowledge , he thought more and more for himself , and had already become disgusted with the cruelties practised upon the unfortunate negroes , when the slave-vessel was seized upon by Cain and converted into a pirate .
Parsing [sent. 748 len. 25]: At first , the enormities committed had not been so great ; vessels had been seized and plundered , but life had been spared .
Parsing [sent. 749 len. 60]: In the course of crime , however , the descent is rapid : and as , from information given by those who had been released , the schooner was more than once in danger of being captured , latterly no lives had been spared ; and but too often the murders had been attended with deeds even more atrocious .
Parsing [sent. 750 len. 22]: Francisco had witnessed scenes of horror until his young blood curdled : he had expostulated to save , but in vain .
Parsing [sent. 751 len. 46]: Disgusted with the captain and the crew , and their deeds of cruelty , he had latterly expressed his opinions fearlessly , and defied the captain ; for , in the heat of an altercation , Cain had acknowledged that Francisco was not his son .
Parsing [sent. 752 len. 61]: Had any of the crew or officers expressed but a tithe of what had fallen from the bold lips of Francisco , they would have long before paid the forfeit of their temerity ; but there was a feeling towards Francisco which could not be stifled in the breast of Cain -- it was the feeling of association and habit .
Parsing [sent. 753 len. 24]: The boy had been his companion for years : and from assuetude had become , as it were , a part of himself .
Parsing [sent. 754 len. 61]: There is a principle in our nature which , even when that nature is most debased , will never leave us -- that of requiring something to love , something to protect and watch over : it is shown towards a dog , or any other animal , if it can not be lavished upon one of our own species .
Parsing [sent. 755 len. 23]: Such was the feeling which so forcibly held Cain towards Francisco ; such was the feeling which had hitherto saved his life .
Parsing [sent. 756 len. 44]: After having paced up and down for some time , the youth took his seat on the locker which the captain had quitted : his eye soon caught the head of Pompey , who looked into the cabin and beckoned with his finger .
Parsing [sent. 757 len. 35]: Francisco rose , and , taking up a flagon from the buffet which contained some spirits , walked to the door , and , without saying a word , handed it to the Krouman .
Parsing [sent. 758 len. 25]: `` Massa Francisco , '' whispered Pompey , `` Pompey say -- all Kroumen say -- suppose they run away , you go too ?
Parsing [sent. 759 len. 14]: Pompey say -- all Kroumen say -- suppose they try to kill you ?
Parsing [sent. 760 len. 9]: Nebber kill you while one Krouman alive . ''
Parsing [sent. 761 len. 28]: The negro then gently pushed Francisco back with his hand , as if not wishing to hear his answer , and hastened forward on the berth deck .
Parsing [sent. 762 len. 3]: CHAPTER EIGHT .
Parsing [sent. 763 len. 3]: THE ATTACK .
Parsing [sent. 764 len. 26]: In the meantime , the sea-breeze had risen in the offing , and was sweeping along the surface to where the schooner was at anchor .
Parsing [sent. 765 len. 29]: The captain ordered a man to the cross-trees , directing him to keep a good look-out , while he walked the deck in company with his first mate .
Parsing [sent. 766 len. 77]: `` She may not have sailed until a day or two later , '' said the captain , continuing the conversation ; `` I have made allowance for that , and , depend upon it , as she makes the eastern passage , we must soon fall in with her ; if she does not heave in sight this evening , by daylight I shall stretch out in the offing ; I know the Portuguese well .
Parsing [sent. 767 len. 26]: The sea-breeze has caught our craft : let them run up the inner jib , and see that she does not foul her anchor . ''
Parsing [sent. 768 len. 36]: It was now late in the afternoon , and dinner had been sent into the cabin ; the captain descended , and took his seat at the table with Francisco , who ate in silence .
Parsing [sent. 769 len. 49]: Once or twice the captain , whose wrath had subsided , and whose kindly feelings towards Francisco , checked for a time , had returned with greater force , tried , but in vain , to rally him to conversation , when '' _ Sail ho _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 770 len. 6]: was shouted from the mast-head .
Parsing [sent. 771 len. 9]: `` There she is , by God ! ''
Parsing [sent. 772 len. 21]: cried the captain , jumping from , and then , as if checking himself , immediately resuming , his seat .
Parsing [sent. 773 len. 19]: Francisco put his hand to his forehead , covering his eyes as his elbow leant upon the table .
Parsing [sent. 774 len. 28]: `` A large ship , sir ; we can see down to the second reef of her topsails , '' said Hawkhurst , looking down the skylight .
Parsing [sent. 775 len. 25]: The captain hastily swallowed some wine from a flagon , cast a look of scorn and anger upon Francisco , and rushed on deck .
Parsing [sent. 776 len. 7]: `` Be smart , lads ! ''
Parsing [sent. 777 len. 74]: cried the captain , after a few seconds ' survey of the vessel through his glass ; `` that 's her : furl the awnings , and run the anchor up to the bows : there 's more silver in that vessel , my lads , than your chests will hold : and the good saints of the churches at Goa will have to wait a little longer for their gold candlesticks . ''
Parsing [sent. 778 len. 32]: The crew were immediately on the alert ; the awnings were furled , and all the men , stretching aft the spring cable , walked the anchor up to the bows .
Parsing [sent. 779 len. 28]: In two minutes more the _ Avenger _ was standing out on the starboard tack , shaping her course so as to cut off the ill-fated vessel .
Parsing [sent. 780 len. 22]: The breeze freshened , and the schooner darted through the smooth water with the impetuosity of a dolphin after its prey .
Parsing [sent. 781 len. 38]: In an hour the hull of the ship was plainly to be distinguished ; but the sun was near to the horizon , and before they could ascertain what their force might be , daylight had disappeared .
Parsing [sent. 782 len. 44]: Whether the schooner had been perceived or not , it was impossible to say ; at all events , the course of the ship had not been altered , and if she had seen the schooner , she evidently treated her with contempt .
Parsing [sent. 783 len. 56]: On board the _ Avenger _ , they were not idle ; the long gun in the centre had been cleared from the incumbrances which surrounded it , the other guns had been cast loose , shot handed up , and everything prepared for action , with all the energy and discipline of a man-of-war .
Parsing [sent. 784 len. 22]: The chase had not been lost sight of , the eyes of the pirate-captain were fixed upon her through a night-glass .
Parsing [sent. 785 len. 35]: In about an hour more the schooner was within a mile of the ship , and now altered her course so as to range up within a cable 's length of her to leeward .
Parsing [sent. 786 len. 8]: Cain stood upon the gunwale and hailed .
Parsing [sent. 787 len. 6]: The answer was in Portuguese .
Parsing [sent. 788 len. 11]: `` Heave to , or I 'll sink you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 789 len. 7]: replied he in the same language .
Parsing [sent. 790 len. 24]: A general discharge from a broadside of carronades , and a heavy volley of muskets from the Portuguese , was the decided answer .
Parsing [sent. 791 len. 53]: The broadside , too much elevated to hit the low hull of the schooner , was still not without effect -- the foretopmast fell , the jaws of the main-gaff were severed , and a large proportion of the standing as well as the running rigging came rattling down on her decks .
Parsing [sent. 792 len. 20]: The volley of musketry was more fatal : thirteen of the pirates were wounded , some of them severely .
Parsing [sent. 793 len. 4]: `` Well done !
Parsing [sent. 794 len. 13]: John Portuguese , '' cried Hawkhurst : `` by the holy poker !
Parsing [sent. 795 len. 11]: I never gave you credit for so much pluck . ''
Parsing [sent. 796 len. 25]: `` Which they shall dearly pay for , '' was the cool reply of Cain , as he still remained in his exposed situation .
Parsing [sent. 797 len. 5]: `` Blood for blood !
Parsing [sent. 798 len. 44]: if I drink it , '' observed the second mate , as he looked at the crimson rivulet trickling down the fingers of his left hand from a wound in his arm -- `` just tie my handkerchief round this , Bill . ''
Parsing [sent. 799 len. 20]: In the interim , Cain had desired his crew to elevate their guns , and the broadside was returned .
Parsing [sent. 800 len. 34]: `` That will do , my lads : starboard ; ease off the boom-sheet ; let her go right round , Hawkhurst , -- we can not afford to lose our men . ''
Parsing [sent. 801 len. 12]: The schooner wore round , and ran astern of her opponent .
Parsing [sent. 802 len. 29]: The Portuguese on board the ship , imagining that the schooner , finding she had met with unexpected resistance , had sheered off , gave a loud cheer .
Parsing [sent. 803 len. 13]: `` The last you will ever give , my fine fellows ! ''
Parsing [sent. 804 len. 7]: observed Cain , with a sneer .
Parsing [sent. 805 len. 15]: In a few moments the schooner had run a mile astern of the ship .
Parsing [sent. 806 len. 47]: `` Now then , Hawkhurst , let her come too and about ; man the long gun , and see that every shot is pitched into her , while the rest of them get up a new foretopmast , and knot and splice the rigging . ''
Parsing [sent. 807 len. 58]: The schooner 's head was again turned towards the ship ; her position was right astern , about a mile distant or rather more ; the long 82-pounder gun amidships was now regularly served , every shot passing through the cabin-windows , or some other part of the ship 's stern , raking her fore and aft .
Parsing [sent. 808 len. 52]: In vain did the ship alter her course , and present her broadside to the schooner ; the latter was immediately checked in her speed , so as to keep the prescribed distance at which the carronades of the ship were useless , and the execution from the long gun decisive .
Parsing [sent. 809 len. 22]: The ship was at the mercy of the pirate ; and , as may be expected , no mercy was shown .
Parsing [sent. 810 len. 35]: For three hours did this murderous attack continue , when the gun , which , as before observed , was of brass , became so heated that the pirate-captain desired his men to discontinue .
Parsing [sent. 811 len. 63]: Whether the ship had surrendered or not it was impossible to say , as it was too dark to distinguish : while the long gun was served , the foretop-mast and main-gaff had been shifted , and all the standing and running rigging made good ; the schooner keeping her distance , and following in the wake of the ship until daylight .
Parsing [sent. 812 len. 55]: We must now repair on board of the ship ; she was an Indiaman ; one of the very few that occasionally are sent out by the Portuguese government to a country which once owned their undivided sway , but in which , at present , they hold but a few miles of territory .
Parsing [sent. 813 len. 34]: She was bound to Goa , and had on board a small detachment of troops , a new governor and his two sons , a bishop and his niece , with her attendant .
Parsing [sent. 814 len. 30]: The sailing of a vessel with such a freight was a circumstance of rare occurrence , and was , of course , generally bruited about long before her departure .
Parsing [sent. 815 len. 56]: Cain had , for some months , received all the necessary intelligence relative to her cargo and destination ; but , as usual with the Portuguese of the present day , delay upon delay had followed , and it was not until about three weeks previous that he had been assured of her immediate departure .
Parsing [sent. 816 len. 34]: He then ran down the coast to the bay we have mentioned , that he might intercept her ; and , as the event had proved , showed his usual judgment and decision .
Parsing [sent. 817 len. 77]: The fire of the schooner had been most destructive ; many of the Indiaman 's crew , as well as of the troops , had been mowed down one after another ; until at last , finding that all their efforts to defend themselves were useless , most of those who were still unhurt had consulted their safety , and hastened down to the lowest recesses of the hold to avoid the raking and destructive shot .
Parsing [sent. 818 len. 38]: At the time that the schooner had discontinued her fire to allow the gun to cool , there was no one on deck but the Portuguese captain and one old weatherbeaten seaman who stood at the helm .
Parsing [sent. 819 len. 116]: Below , in the orlop-deck , the remainder of the crew and the passengers were huddled together in a small space : some were attending to the wounded , who were numerous ; others were invoking the saints to their assistance ; the bishop , a tall , dignified person , apparently nearly sixty years of age , was kneeling in the centre of the group , which was dimly lighted by two or three lanterns , at one time in fervent prayer , at another , interrupted , that he might give absolution to those wounded men whose spirits were departing , and who were brought down and laid before him by their comrades .
Parsing [sent. 820 len. 53]: On one side of him knelt his orphan niece , a young girl of about seventeen years of age , watching his countenance as he prayed , or bending down with a look of pity and tearful eyes on her expiring countrymen , whose last moments were gladdened by his holy offices .
Parsing [sent. 821 len. 36]: On the other side of the bishop , stood the governor , Don Philip de Ribiera , and his two sons , youths in their prime , and holding commissions in the king 's service .
Parsing [sent. 822 len. 22]: There was melancholy on the brow of Don Ribiera ; he was prepared for , and he anticipated , the worst .
Parsing [sent. 823 len. 54]: The eldest son had his eyes fixed upon the sweet countenance of Teresa de Silva -- that very evening , as they walked together on the deck , had they exchanged their vows -- that very evening they had luxuriated in the present , and had dwelt with delightful anticipation on the future .
Parsing [sent. 824 len. 10]: But we must leave them and return on deck .
Parsing [sent. 825 len. 28]: The captain of the Portuguese ship had walked aft , and now went up to Antonio , the old seaman , who was standing at the wheel .
Parsing [sent. 826 len. 34]: `` I still see her with the glass , Antonio , and yet she has not fired for nearly two hours ; do you think any accident has happened to her long gun ?
Parsing [sent. 827 len. 10]: if so , we may have some chance . ''
Parsing [sent. 828 len. 5]: Antonio shook his head .
Parsing [sent. 829 len. 47]: `` We have but little chance , I am afraid , my captain ; I knew by the ring of the gun , when she fired it , that it was brass ; indeed , no schooner could carry a long iron gun of that calibre .
Parsing [sent. 830 len. 47]: Depend upon it , she only waits for the metal to cool and daylight to return : a long gun or two might have saved us ; but now , as she has the advantage of us in heels , we are at her mercy . ''
Parsing [sent. 831 len. 11]: `` What can she be -- a French privateer ? ''
Parsing [sent. 832 len. 43]: `` I trust it may be so ; and I have promised a silver candlestick to St. Antonio that it may prove no worse : we then may have some chance of seeing our homes again ; but I fear not . ''
Parsing [sent. 833 len. 15]: `` What , then , do you imagine her to be , Antonio ? ''
Parsing [sent. 834 len. 12]: `` The pirate which we have heard so much of . ''
Parsing [sent. 835 len. 5]: `` Jesu protect us !
Parsing [sent. 836 len. 13]: we must then sell our lives as dearly as we can . ''
Parsing [sent. 837 len. 20]: `` So I intend to do , my captain , '' replied Antonio , shifting the helm a spoke .
Parsing [sent. 838 len. 24]: The day broke , and showed the schooner continuing her pursuit at the same distance astern , without any apparent movement on board .
Parsing [sent. 839 len. 35]: It was not until the sun was some degrees above the horizon that the smoke was again seen to envelop her bows , and the shot crashed through the timbers of the Portuguese ship .
Parsing [sent. 840 len. 36]: The reason for this delay was , that the pirate waited till the sun was up to ascertain if there were any other vessels to be seen , previous to his pouncing on his quarry .
Parsing [sent. 841 len. 19]: The Portuguese captain went aft and hoisted his ensign , but no flag was shown by the schooner .
Parsing [sent. 842 len. 38]: Again whistled the ball , and again did it tear up the decks of the unfortunate ship : many of those who had re-ascended to ascertain what was going on , now hastily sought their former retreat .
Parsing [sent. 843 len. 25]: `` Mind the helm , Antonio , '' said the Portuguese captain ; `` I must go down and consult with the governor . ''
Parsing [sent. 844 len. 37]: `` Never fear , my captain ; as long as these limbs hold together , I will do my duty , '' replied the old man , exhausted as he was by long watching and fatigue .
Parsing [sent. 845 len. 20]: The captain descended to the orlop-deck , where he found the major part of the crew and passengers assembled .
Parsing [sent. 846 len. 30]: `` My lords , '' said he , addressing the governor and the bishop , `` the schooner has not shown any colours , although our own are hoisted .
Parsing [sent. 847 len. 9]: I am come down to know your pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 848 len. 20]: Defence we can make none ; and I fear that we are at the mercy of a pirate . ''
Parsing [sent. 849 len. 5]: `` A pirate ! ''
Parsing [sent. 850 len. 13]: ejaculated several , beating their breasts , and calling upon their saints .
Parsing [sent. 851 len. 60]: `` Silence , my good people , silence , '' quietly observed the bishop ; `` as to what it may be best to do , '' continued he , turning to the captain , `` I can not advise ; I am a man of peace , and unfit to hold a place in a council of war .
Parsing [sent. 852 len. 14]: Don Ribiera , I must refer the point to you and your sons .
Parsing [sent. 853 len. 18]: Tremble not , my dear Teresa ; are we not under the protection of the Almighty ? ''
Parsing [sent. 854 len. 8]: `` Holy Virgin , pity us ! ''
Parsing [sent. 855 len. 41]: `` Come , my sons , '' said Don Ribiera , `` we will go on deck and consult : let not any of the men follow us ; it is useless risking lives which may yet be valuable . ''
Parsing [sent. 856 len. 23]: Don Ribiera and his sons followed the captain to the quarter deck , and with him and Antonio they held a consultation .
Parsing [sent. 857 len. 78]: `` We have but one chance , '' observed the old man , after a time : `` let us haul down our colours as if in submission ; they will then range up alongside , and either board us from the schooner , or from their boats ; at all events , we shall find out what she is , and , if a pirate , we must sell our lives as dearly as we can .
Parsing [sent. 858 len. 32]: If , when we haul down the colours , she ranges up alongside , as I expect she will , let all the men be prepared for a desperate struggle . ''
Parsing [sent. 859 len. 23]: `` You are right , Antonio , '' replied the governor ; `` go aft captain , and haul down the colours !
Parsing [sent. 860 len. 9]: -- let us see what she does now .
Parsing [sent. 861 len. 5]: Down , my boys !
Parsing [sent. 862 len. 10]: and prepare the men to do their duty . ''
Parsing [sent. 863 len. 22]: As Antonio had predicted , so soon as the colours were hauled down , the schooner ceased firing and made sail .
Parsing [sent. 864 len. 55]: She ranged up on the quarter of the ship , and up to her main peak soared the terrific black flag ; her broadside was poured into the Indiaman , and before the smoke had cleared away there was a concussion from the meeting sides , and the bearded pirates poured upon her decks .
Parsing [sent. 865 len. 20]: The crew of the Portuguese , with the detachment of troops , still formed a considerable body of men .
Parsing [sent. 866 len. 23]: The sight of the black flag had struck ice into every heart , but the feeling was resolved into one of desperation .
Parsing [sent. 867 len. 8]: `` Knives , men , knives ! ''
Parsing [sent. 868 len. 15]: roared Antonio , rushing on to the attack , followed by the most brave .
Parsing [sent. 869 len. 6]: `` Blood for blood ! ''
Parsing [sent. 870 len. 13]: cried the second mate , aiming a blow at the old man .
Parsing [sent. 871 len. 33]: `` You have it , '' replied Antonio , as his knife entered the pirate 's heart , while , at the same moment , he fell and was himself a corpse .
Parsing [sent. 872 len. 15]: The struggle was deadly , but the numbers and ferocity of the pirates prevailed .
Parsing [sent. 873 len. 14]: Cain rushed forward followed by Hawkhurst , bearing down all who opposed them .
Parsing [sent. 874 len. 39]: With one blow from the pirate-captain , the head of Don Ribiera was severed to the shoulder ; a second struck down the eldest son , while the sword of Hawkhurst passed through the body of the other .
Parsing [sent. 875 len. 16]: The Portuguese captain had already fallen , and the men no longer stood their ground .
Parsing [sent. 876 len. 19]: A general massacre ensued , and the bodies were thrown overboard as fast as the men were slaughtered .
Parsing [sent. 877 len. 20]: In less than five minutes there was not a living Portuguese on the bloody decks of the ill-fated ship .
Parsing [sent. 878 len. 3]: CHAPTER NINE .
Parsing [sent. 879 len. 3]: THE CAPTURE .
Parsing [sent. 880 len. 19]: `` Pass the word for not a man to go below , Hawkhurst , '' said the pirate-captain .
Parsing [sent. 881 len. 14]: `` I have , sir ; and sentries are stationed at the hatchways .
Parsing [sent. 882 len. 8]: Shall we haul the schooner off ? ''
Parsing [sent. 883 len. 23]: `` No , let her remain ; the breeze is faint already : we shall have a calm in half an hour .
Parsing [sent. 884 len. 7]: Have we lost many men ? ''
Parsing [sent. 885 len. 22]: `` Only seven , that I can reckon ; but we have lost Wallace , '' -LRB- the second mate -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 886 len. 32]: `` A little promotion will do no harm , '' replied Cain ; `` take a dozen of our best men and search the ship , there are others alive yet .
Parsing [sent. 887 len. 37]: By-the-by , send a watch on board of the schooner ; she is left to the mercy of the Kroumen , and -- '' `` One who is better out of her , '' replied Hawkhurst .
Parsing [sent. 888 len. 12]: `` And those we find below -- '' continued the mate .
Parsing [sent. 889 len. 4]: `` Alive ! ''
Parsing [sent. 890 len. 46]: `` True ; we may else be puzzled where to find that portion of her cargo which suits us , '' said Hawkhurst , going down the hatchway to collect the men who were plundering on the main deck and in the captain 's cabin .
Parsing [sent. 891 len. 6]: `` Here , you Maltese !
Parsing [sent. 892 len. 4]: up , there !
Parsing [sent. 893 len. 19]: and look well round if there is anything in sight , '' said the captain , walking aft .
Parsing [sent. 894 len. 28]: Before Hawkhurst had collected the men and ordered them on board of the schooner , as usual in those latitudes , it had fallen a perfect calm .
Parsing [sent. 895 len. 9]: Where was Francisco during this scene of blood ?
Parsing [sent. 896 len. 10]: He had remained in the cabin of the schooner .
Parsing [sent. 897 len. 86]: Cain had more than once gone down to him , to persuade him to come on deck and assist at the boarding of the Portuguese , but in vain -- his sole reply to the threats and solicitations of the pirate was -- `` Do with me as you please -- I have made up my mind -- you know I do not fear death -- as long as I remain on board of this vessel , I will take no part in your atrocities .
Parsing [sent. 898 len. 21]: If you do respect my mother 's memory , suffer her son to seek an honest and honourable livelihood . ''
Parsing [sent. 899 len. 96]: The words of Francisco were ringing in the ears of Cain as he walked up and down on the quarter-deck of the Portuguese vessel , and , debased as he was , he could not help thinking that the youth was his equal in animal , and his superior in mental , courage -- he was arguing in his own mind upon the course he should pursue with respect to Francisco , when Hawkhurst made his appearance on deck , followed by his men , who dragged up six individuals who had escaped the massacre .
Parsing [sent. 900 len. 56]: These were the bishop ; his niece , a Portuguese girl ; her attendant ; the supercargo of the vessel ; a sacristan ; and a servant of the ecclesiastic ; they were hauled along the deck and placed in a row before the captain , who cast his eye upon them in severe scrutiny .
Parsing [sent. 901 len. 85]: The bishop and his niece looked round , the one proudly meeting the eye of Cain , although he felt that his hour was come ; the other carefully avoiding his gaze , and glancing round to ascertain whether there were any other prisoners , and if so , if her betrothed was amongst them ; but her eye discovered not what she sought -- it was met only by the bearded faces of the pirate-crew , and the blood which bespattered the deck .
Parsing [sent. 902 len. 8]: She covered her face with her hands .
Parsing [sent. 903 len. 15]: `` Bring that man forward , '' said Cain , pointing to the servant .
Parsing [sent. 904 len. 6]: `` Who are you . ''
Parsing [sent. 905 len. 10]: `` A servant of my lord the bishop . ''
Parsing [sent. 906 len. 5]: `` And you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 907 len. 4]: continued the captain .
Parsing [sent. 908 len. 12]: `` A poor sacristan attending upon my lord the bishop . ''
Parsing [sent. 909 len. 5]: `` And you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 910 len. 6]: cried he to a third .
Parsing [sent. 911 len. 8]: `` The supercargo of this vessel . ''
Parsing [sent. 912 len. 8]: `` Put him aside , Hawkhurst ! ''
Parsing [sent. 913 len. 8]: `` Do you want the others ? ''
Parsing [sent. 914 len. 4]: inquired Hawkhurst significantly .
Parsing [sent. 915 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 916 len. 19]: Hawkhurst gave a signal to some of the pirates , who led away the sacristan and the servant .
Parsing [sent. 917 len. 17]: A stifled shriek and a heavy plunge in the water were heard a few seconds after .
Parsing [sent. 918 len. 57]: During this time the pirate had been questioning the supercargo as to the contents of the vessel , and her stowage , when he was suddenly interrupted by one of the pirates , who in a hurried voice , stated that the ship had received several shot between wind and water , and was sinking fast .
Parsing [sent. 919 len. 53]: Cain , who was standing on the side of the carronade with his sword in his hand , raised his arm and struck the pirate a blow on the head with the hilt , which , whether intended or not , fractured his skull , and the man fell upon the deck .
Parsing [sent. 920 len. 6]: `` Take that , babbler !
Parsing [sent. 921 len. 18]: for your intelligence ; if these men are obstinate , we may have worked for nothing . ''
Parsing [sent. 922 len. 33]: The crew , who felt the truth of their captain 's remark , did not appear to object to the punishment inflicted , and the body of the man was dragged away .
Parsing [sent. 923 len. 18]: `` What mercy can we expect from those who show no mercy even to each other ? ''
Parsing [sent. 924 len. 10]: observed the bishop , lifting his eyes to heaven .
Parsing [sent. 925 len. 4]: `` Silence ! ''
Parsing [sent. 926 len. 30]: cried Cain , who now interrogated the supercargo as to the contents of the hold -- the poor man answered as well as he could -- `` the plate !
Parsing [sent. 927 len. 11]: the money for the troops -- where are they ? ''
Parsing [sent. 928 len. 34]: `` The money for the troops is in the spirit-room , but of the plate I know nothing ; it is in some of the cases belonging to my lord the bishop . ''
Parsing [sent. 929 len. 3]: `` Hawkhurst !
Parsing [sent. 930 len. 29]: down at once into the spirit-room , and see to the money ; in the mean time I will ask a few questions of this reverend father . ''
Parsing [sent. 931 len. 13]: `` And the supercargo -- do you want him any more ? ''
Parsing [sent. 932 len. 8]: `` No ; he may go . ''
Parsing [sent. 933 len. 66]: The poor man fell down on his knees in thankfulness at what he considered his escape : he was dragged away by the pirates , and , it is scarcely necessary to add that in a minute his body was torn to pieces by the sharks , who , scenting their prey from a distance , were now playing in shoals around the two vessels .
Parsing [sent. 934 len. 50]: The party on the quarter-deck were now -LRB- unperceived by the captain -RRB- joined by Francisco , who , hearing from the Krouman , Pompey , that there were prisoners still on board , and amongst them two females , had come over to plead the cause of mercy .
Parsing [sent. 935 len. 26]: `` Most reverend father , '' observed Cain , after a short pause , `` you have many articles of value in this vessel ? ''
Parsing [sent. 936 len. 36]: `` None , '' replied the bishop , `` except this poor girl ; she is , indeed , beyond price , and will , I trust , soon be an angel in heaven . ''
Parsing [sent. 937 len. 50]: `` Yet is this world , if what you preach be true , a purgatory which must be passed through previous to arriving there , and that girl may think death a blessing compared to what she may expect if you refuse to tell me what I would know .
Parsing [sent. 938 len. 18]: You have good store of gold and silver ornaments for your churches -- where are they ? ''
Parsing [sent. 939 len. 12]: `` They are among the packages intrusted to my care . ''
Parsing [sent. 940 len. 10]: `` How many may you have in all ? ''
Parsing [sent. 941 len. 9]: `` A hundred , if not more . ''
Parsing [sent. 942 len. 16]: `` Will you deign to inform me where I may find what I require ? ''
Parsing [sent. 943 len. 28]: `` The gold and silver are not mine , but are the property of that God to whom they have been dedicated , '' replied the bishop .
Parsing [sent. 944 len. 11]: `` Answer quickly ; no more subterfuge , good sir .
Parsing [sent. 945 len. 8]: Where is it to be found ? ''
Parsing [sent. 946 len. 42]: `` I will not tell , thou blood-stained man ; at least ; in this instance , there shall be disappointment , and the sea shall swallow up those earthly treasures to obtain which thou hast so deeply imbrued thy hands .
Parsing [sent. 947 len. 2]: Pirate !
Parsing [sent. 948 len. 10]: I repeat it , I will not tell . ''
Parsing [sent. 949 len. 9]: `` Seize that girl , my lads ! ''
Parsing [sent. 950 len. 16]: cried Cain ; `` she is yours , do with her as you please . ''
Parsing [sent. 951 len. 4]: `` Save me !
Parsing [sent. 952 len. 6]: oh , save me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 953 len. 10]: shrieked Teresa , clinging to the bishop 's robe .
Parsing [sent. 954 len. 9]: The pirates advanced and laid hold of Teresa .
Parsing [sent. 955 len. 16]: Francisco bounded from where he stood behind the captain , and dashed away the foremost .
Parsing [sent. 956 len. 6]: `` Are you men ? ''
Parsing [sent. 957 len. 8]: cried he , as the pirates retreated .
Parsing [sent. 958 len. 8]: `` Holy sir , I honour you .
Parsing [sent. 959 len. 2]: Alas !
Parsing [sent. 960 len. 12]: I can not save you , '' continued Francisco , mournfully .
Parsing [sent. 961 len. 6]: `` Yet will I try .
Parsing [sent. 962 len. 27]: On my knees -- by the love you bore my mother -- by the affection you once bore me -- do not commit this horrid deed .
Parsing [sent. 963 len. 4]: My lads ! ''
Parsing [sent. 964 len. 53]: continued Francisco , appealing to the pirates , `` join with me and entreat your captain ; ye are too brave , too manly , to injure the helpless and the innocent -- above all , to shed the blood of a holy man , and of this poor trembling maiden . ''
Parsing [sent. 965 len. 22]: There was a pause -- even the pirates appeared to side with Francisco , though none of them dared to speak .
Parsing [sent. 966 len. 20]: The muscles of the captain 's face quivered with emotion , but from what source could not be ascertained .
Parsing [sent. 967 len. 11]: At this moment the interest of the scene was heightened .
Parsing [sent. 968 len. 46]: The girl who attended upon Teresa , crouched on her knees with terror , had been casting her fearful eyes upon the men who composed the pirate-crew ; suddenly she uttered a scream of delight as she discovered among them one that she well knew .
Parsing [sent. 969 len. 18]: He was a young man , about twenty-five years of age , with little or no beard .
Parsing [sent. 970 len. 39]: He had been her lover in his more innocent days ; and she , for more than a year , had mourned him as dead , for the vessel in which he sailed had never been heard of .
Parsing [sent. 971 len. 21]: It had been taken by the pirate , and , to save his life , he had joined the crew .
Parsing [sent. 972 len. 3]: `` Filippo !
Parsing [sent. 973 len. 3]: Filippo ! ''
Parsing [sent. 974 len. 9]: screamed the girl , rushing into his arms .
Parsing [sent. 975 len. 3]: `` Mistress !
Parsing [sent. 976 len. 10]: it is Filippo ; and we are safe . ''
Parsing [sent. 977 len. 33]: Filippo instantly recognised her : the sight of her brought back to his memory his days of happiness and of innocence ; and the lovers were clasped in each other 's arms .
Parsing [sent. 978 len. 4]: `` Save them !
Parsing [sent. 979 len. 3]: spare them !
Parsing [sent. 980 len. 8]: -- by the spirit of my mother !
Parsing [sent. 981 len. 14]: I charge you , '' repeated Francisco , again appealing to the captain .
Parsing [sent. 982 len. 12]: `` May God bless thee , thou good young man ! ''
Parsing [sent. 983 len. 14]: said the bishop , advancing and placing his hand upon Francisco 's head .
Parsing [sent. 984 len. 20]: Cain answered not ; but his broad expanded chest heaved with emotion -- when Hawkhurst burst into the group .
Parsing [sent. 985 len. 20]: `` We are too late for the money , captain : the water is already six feet above it .
Parsing [sent. 986 len. 9]: We must now try for the treasure . ''
Parsing [sent. 987 len. 13]: This intelligence appeared to check the current of the captain 's feelings .
Parsing [sent. 988 len. 22]: `` Now , in one word , sir , '' said he to the bishop , `` where is the treasure ?
Parsing [sent. 989 len. 10]: Trifle not , or , by Heaven -- ! ''
Parsing [sent. 990 len. 18]: `` Name not Heaven , '' replied the bishop ; `` you have had my answer . ''
Parsing [sent. 991 len. 16]: The captain turned away , and gave some directions to Hawkhurst , who hastened below .
Parsing [sent. 992 len. 42]: `` Remove that boy , '' said Cain to the pirates , pointing to Francisco , `` Separate those two fools , '' continued he , looking towards Filippo and the girl , who were sobbing in each other 's arms .
Parsing [sent. 993 len. 4]: `` Never ! ''
Parsing [sent. 994 len. 3]: cried Filippo .
Parsing [sent. 995 len. 8]: `` Throw the girl to the sharks !
Parsing [sent. 996 len. 4]: Do you hear ?
Parsing [sent. 997 len. 7]: Am I to be obeyed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 998 len. 7]: cried Cain , raising his cutlass .
Parsing [sent. 999 len. 27]: Filippo started up , disengaged himself from the girl , and , drawing his knife , rushed towards the captain to plunge it in his bosom .
Parsing [sent. 1000 len. 24]: With the quickness of lightning the captain caught his uplifted hand , and , breaking his wrist , hurled him to the deck .
Parsing [sent. 1001 len. 4]: `` Indeed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1002 len. 7]: cried he , with a sneer .
Parsing [sent. 1003 len. 15]: `` You shall not separate us , '' said Filippo , attempting to rise .
Parsing [sent. 1004 len. 15]: `` I do not intend it , my good lad , '' replied Cain .
Parsing [sent. 1005 len. 11]: `` Lash them both together and launch them overboard . ''
Parsing [sent. 1006 len. 28]: This order was obeyed : for the pirates not only quailed before the captain 's cool courage , but were indignant that his life had been attempted .
Parsing [sent. 1007 len. 32]: There was little occasion to tie the unhappy pair together ; they were locked so fast in each other 's arms that it would have been impossible almost to separate them .
Parsing [sent. 1008 len. 16]: In this state they were carried to the entering-port , and cast into the sea .
Parsing [sent. 1009 len. 4]: `` Monster ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1010 len. 21]: cried the bishop , as he heard the splash , `` thou wilt have a heavy reckoning for this . ''
Parsing [sent. 1011 len. 15]: `` Now bring these forward , '' said Cain , with a savage voice .
Parsing [sent. 1012 len. 11]: The bishop and his niece were led to the gangway .
Parsing [sent. 1013 len. 10]: `` What dost thou see , good bishop ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1014 len. 28]: said Cain pointing to the discoloured water , and the rapid motion of the fins of the sharks , eager in the anticipation of a further supply .
Parsing [sent. 1015 len. 37]: `` I see ravenous creatures after their kind , '' replied the bishop , `` who will , in all probability , soon tear asunder those poor limbs ; but I see no monster like thyself .
Parsing [sent. 1016 len. 24]: Teresa , dearest , fear not ; there is a God , an avenging God ; as well as a rewarding one . ''
Parsing [sent. 1017 len. 15]: But Teresa 's eyes were closed -- she could not look upon the scene .
Parsing [sent. 1018 len. 38]: `` You have your choice ; first torture , and then your body to those sharks for your own portion : and as for the girl , this moment I hand her over to my crew . ''
Parsing [sent. 1019 len. 4]: `` Never ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1020 len. 13]: shrieked Teresa , springing from the deck and plunging into the wave .
Parsing [sent. 1021 len. 50]: There was a splash of contention , the lashing of tails , until the water was in a foam , and then the dark colour gradually cleared away , and nought was to be seen , but the pure blue wave and the still unsatisfied monsters of the deep .
Parsing [sent. 1022 len. 7]: `` The screws -- the screws !
Parsing [sent. 1023 len. 2]: quick !
Parsing [sent. 1024 len. 33]: we 'll have the secret from him , '' cried the pirate-captain , turning to his crew , who , villains as they were , had been shocked at this last catastrophe .
Parsing [sent. 1025 len. 5]: `` Seize him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1026 len. 6]: `` Touch him not ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1027 len. 13]: cried Francisco , standing on the hammock-netting ; `` touch him not !
Parsing [sent. 1028 len. 6]: if you are men . ''
Parsing [sent. 1029 len. 23]: Boiling with rage , Cain let go the arm of the bishop , drew his pistol , and levelled it at Francisco .
Parsing [sent. 1030 len. 37]: The bishop threw up the arm of Cain as he fired ; saw that he had missed his aim , and clasping his hands , raised his eyes to heaven in thankfulness at Francisco 's escape .
Parsing [sent. 1031 len. 26]: In this position he was collared by Hawkhurst , whose anger overcame his discretion , and who hurled him through the entering-port into the sea .
Parsing [sent. 1032 len. 5]: `` Officious fool ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1033 len. 12]: muttered Cain , when he perceived what the mate had done .
Parsing [sent. 1034 len. 19]: Then , recollecting himself , he cried , -- `` Seize that boy and bring him here . ''
Parsing [sent. 1035 len. 38]: One or two of the crew advanced to obey his orders ; but Pompey and the Kroumen , who had been attentive to what was going on , had collected round Francisco , and a scuffle ensued .
Parsing [sent. 1036 len. 36]: The pirates , not being very determined , nor very anxious to take Francisco , allowed him to be hurried away in the centre of the Kroumen , who bore him safely to the schooner .
Parsing [sent. 1037 len. 33]: In the meantime Hawkhurst , and the major part of the men on board of the ship , had been tearing up the hold to obtain the valuables , but without success .
Parsing [sent. 1038 len. 16]: The water had now reached above the orlop-deck , and all further attempts were unavailing .
Parsing [sent. 1039 len. 34]: The ship was settling fast , and it became necessary to quit her , and haul off the schooner ; that she might not be endangered by the vortex of the sinking vessel .
Parsing [sent. 1040 len. 40]: Cain and Hawkhurst , with their disappointed crew , returned on board the schooner , and before they had succeeded in detaching the two vessels a cable 's length the ship went down with all the treasure so coveted .
Parsing [sent. 1041 len. 37]: The indignation and rage which were expressed by the captain as he rapidly walked the deck in company with his first mate -- his violent gesticulation -- proved to the crew that there was mischief brewing .
Parsing [sent. 1042 len. 39]: Francisco did not return to the cabin ; he remained forward with the Kroumen , who , although but a small portion of the ship 's company , were known to be resolute and not to be despised .
Parsing [sent. 1043 len. 36]: It was also observed that all of them had supplied themselves with arms , and were collected forward , huddled together , watching every motion and manoeuvre , and talking rapidly in their own language .
Parsing [sent. 1044 len. 14]: The schooner was now steered to the north-westward under all press of sail .
Parsing [sent. 1045 len. 32]: The sun again disappeared , but Francisco returned not to the cabin -- he went below , surrounded by the Kroumen , who appeared to have devoted themselves to his protection .
Parsing [sent. 1046 len. 36]: Once during the night Hawkhurst summoned them on deck , but they obeyed not the order ; and to the expostulation of the boatswain 's mate , who came down , they made no reply .
Parsing [sent. 1047 len. 23]: But there were many of the pirates in the schooner who appeared to coincide with the Kroumen in their regard for Francisco .
Parsing [sent. 1048 len. 25]: There are shades of villainy in the most profligate of societies ; and among the pirate 's crew some were not yet wholly debased .
Parsing [sent. 1049 len. 43]: The foul murder of a holy man -- the cruel fate of the beautiful Teresa -- and the barbarous conduct of the captain towards Filippo and his mistress , were deeds of an atrocity to which even the most hardened were unaccustomed .
Parsing [sent. 1050 len. 22]: Francisco 's pleadings in behalf of mercy were at least no crime ; and yet they considered that Francisco was doomed .
Parsing [sent. 1051 len. 55]: He was a general favourite ; the worst-disposed of the pirates , with the exception of Hawkhurst , if they did not love him , could not forbear respecting him ; although at the same time they felt that if Francisco remained on board the power even of Cain himself would soon be destroyed .
Parsing [sent. 1052 len. 24]: For many months Hawkhurst , who detested the youth , had been most earnest that he should be sent out of the schooner .
Parsing [sent. 1053 len. 45]: Now he pressed the captain for his removal in any way , as necessary for their mutual safety , pointing out to Cain the conduct of the Kroumen , and his fears that a large proportion of the ship 's company were equally disaffected .
Parsing [sent. 1054 len. 24]: Cain felt the truth of Hawkhurst 's representation , and he went down to his cabin to consider upon what should be done .
Parsing [sent. 1055 len. 24]: It was past midnight , when Cain , worn out with the conflicting passions of the day , fell into an uneasy slumber .
Parsing [sent. 1056 len. 26]: His dreams were of Francisco 's mother -- she appeared to him pleading for her son , and Cain `` babbled in his sleep . ''
Parsing [sent. 1057 len. 34]: At this time Francisco , with Pompey , had softly crawled aft , that they might obtain , if they found the captain asleep , the pistols of Francisco , with some ammunition .
Parsing [sent. 1058 len. 16]: Pompey slipped in first , and started back when he heard the captain 's voice .
Parsing [sent. 1059 len. 7]: They remained at the cabin-door listening .
Parsing [sent. 1060 len. 21]: `` No , no , '' murmured Cain , `` he must die -- useless -- plead not , woman !
Parsing [sent. 1061 len. 14]: -- I know I murdered thee -- plead not , he dies ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1062 len. 30]: In one of the sockets of the silver lamp there was a lighted wick , the rays of which were sufficient to afford a dim view of the cabin .
Parsing [sent. 1063 len. 21]: Francisco , overhearing the words of Cain , stepped in , and walked up to the side of the bed .
Parsing [sent. 1064 len. 3]: `` Boy !
Parsing [sent. 1065 len. 21]: plead not , '' continued Cain , lying on his back and breathing heavily -- `` plead not -- woman !
Parsing [sent. 1066 len. 6]: -- to-morrow he dies . ''
Parsing [sent. 1067 len. 15]: A pause ensued , as if the sleeping man was listening to a reply .
Parsing [sent. 1068 len. 15]: `` Yes , as I murdered thee , so will I murder him . ''
Parsing [sent. 1069 len. 4]: `` Wretch ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1070 len. 18]: said Francisco , in a low , solemn voice , `` didst thou kill my mother ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1071 len. 8]: `` I did -- I did ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1072 len. 6]: responded Cain , still sleeping .
Parsing [sent. 1073 len. 5]: `` And why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1074 len. 19]: continued Francisco , who at this acknowledgment on the part of the sleeping captain was careless of discovery .
Parsing [sent. 1075 len. 12]: `` In my mood she vexed me , '' answered Cain .
Parsing [sent. 1076 len. 10]: `` Fiend ; thou hast then confessed it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1077 len. 64]: cried Francisco in a loud voice , which awoke the captain , who started up ; but before his senses were well recovered , or his eyes open so as to distinguish their forms , Pompey struck out the light , and all was darkness ; he then put his hand to Francisco 's mouth , and led him out of the cabin .
Parsing [sent. 1078 len. 5]: `` Who 's there ?
Parsing [sent. 1079 len. 6]: -- who 's there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1080 len. 3]: cried Cain .
Parsing [sent. 1081 len. 10]: The officer in charge of the deck hastened down .
Parsing [sent. 1082 len. 8]: `` Did you call , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1083 len. 4]: `` Call ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1084 len. 4]: repeated the captain .
Parsing [sent. 1085 len. 11]: `` I thought there was some one in the cabin .
Parsing [sent. 1086 len. 26]: I want a light -- that 's all , '' continued he , recovering himself , as he wiped the cold perspiration from his forehead .
Parsing [sent. 1087 len. 19]: In the meantime Francisco , with Pompey , had gained his former place of refuge with the Kroumen .
Parsing [sent. 1088 len. 44]: The feelings of the young man changed from agony to revenge ; his object in returning to the cabin to recover his weapons had been frustrated , but his determination now was to take the life of the captain if he possibly could .
Parsing [sent. 1089 len. 27]: The following morning the Kroumen again refused to work or go on deck ; and the state of affairs was reported by Hawkhurst to his chief .
Parsing [sent. 1090 len. 34]: The mate now assumed another tone : for he had sounded not the majority but the most steady and influential men on board , who , like himself , were veterans in crime .
Parsing [sent. 1091 len. 16]: `` It must be , sir ; or you will no longer command this vessel .
Parsing [sent. 1092 len. 8]: I am desired to say so . ''
Parsing [sent. 1093 len. 4]: `` Indeed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1094 len. 7]: replied Cain , with a sneer .
Parsing [sent. 1095 len. 10]: `` Perhaps you have already chosen my successor ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1096 len. 14]: Hawkhurst perceived that he had lost ground , and he changed his manner .
Parsing [sent. 1097 len. 37]: `` I speak but for yourself : if you do not command this vessel I shall not remain in her : if you quit her , I quit also ; and we must find another . ''
Parsing [sent. 1098 len. 11]: Cain was pacified , and the subject was not renewed .
Parsing [sent. 1099 len. 13]: `` Turn the hands up , '' at last said the captain .
Parsing [sent. 1100 len. 5]: The pirate-crew assembled aft .
Parsing [sent. 1101 len. 25]: `` My lads , I am sorry that our laws oblige me to make an example ; but mutiny and disaffection must be punished .
Parsing [sent. 1102 len. 56]: I am equally bound as yourselves by the laws which we have laid down for our guidance while we sail together ; and you may believe that in doing my duty in this instance I am guided by a sense of justice , and wish to prove to you that I am worthy to command .
Parsing [sent. 1103 len. 40]: Francisco has been with me since he was a child ; he has lived with me , and it is painful to part with him : but I am here to see that our laws are put in force .
Parsing [sent. 1104 len. 17]: He has been guilty of repeated mutiny and contempt , and -- he must die . ''
Parsing [sent. 1105 len. 3]: `` Death !
Parsing [sent. 1106 len. 3]: death ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1107 len. 14]: cried several of the pirates in advance : `` death and justice ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1108 len. 6]: `` No more murder ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1109 len. 6]: said several voices from behind .
Parsing [sent. 1110 len. 8]: `` Who 's that that speaks ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1111 len. 11]: `` Too much murder yesterday -- no more murder ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1112 len. 6]: shouted several voices at once .
Parsing [sent. 1113 len. 17]: `` Let the men come forward who speak , '' cried Cain with a withering look .
Parsing [sent. 1114 len. 6]: No one obeyed this order .
Parsing [sent. 1115 len. 8]: `` Down , then , my men !
Parsing [sent. 1116 len. 6]: and bring up Francisco . ''
Parsing [sent. 1117 len. 13]: The whole of the pirate-crew hastened below , but with different intentions .
Parsing [sent. 1118 len. 19]: Some were determined to seize Francisco , and hand him over to death -- others to protect him .
Parsing [sent. 1119 len. 18]: A confused noise was heard -- the shouts of '' _ Down and seize him _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1120 len. 9]: opposed to those of '' _ No murder !
Parsing [sent. 1121 len. 5]: No murder _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1122 len. 29]: Both parties had snatched up their arms ; those who sided with Francisco joined the Kroumen , whilst the others also hastened below to bring him on deck .
Parsing [sent. 1123 len. 20]: A slight scuffle ensued before they separated , and ascertained by the separation the strength of the contending parties .
Parsing [sent. 1124 len. 31]: Francisco , perceiving that he was joined by a large body , desired his men to follow him , went up the fore-ladder , and took possession of the forecastle .
Parsing [sent. 1125 len. 17]: The pirates on his side supplied him with arms , and Francisco stood forward in advance .
Parsing [sent. 1126 len. 30]: Hawkhurst , and those of the crew who sided with him , had retreated to the quarter-deck , and rallied round the captain , who leaned against the capstern .
Parsing [sent. 1127 len. 10]: They were then able to estimate their comparative strength .
Parsing [sent. 1128 len. 39]: The number , on the whole , preponderated in favour of Francisco ; but on the captain 's side were the older and more athletic of the crew , and , we may add , the more determined .
Parsing [sent. 1129 len. 30]: Still , the captain and Hawkhurst perceived the danger of their situation , and it was thought advisable to parley for the present , and wreak their vengeance hereafter .
Parsing [sent. 1130 len. 18]: For a few minutes there was a low consultation between both parties ; at last Cain advanced .
Parsing [sent. 1131 len. 37]: `` My lads , '' said he , addressing those who had rallied round Francisco , `` I little thought that a fire-brand would have been cast in this vessel to set us all at variance .
Parsing [sent. 1132 len. 18]: It was my duty , as your captain , to propose that our laws should be enforced .
Parsing [sent. 1133 len. 10]: Tell me now what is it that you wish .
Parsing [sent. 1134 len. 18]: I am only here as your captain , and to take the sense of the whole crew .
Parsing [sent. 1135 len. 30]: I have no animosity against that lad : I have loved him -- I have cherished him ; but like a viper , he has stung me in return .
Parsing [sent. 1136 len. 16]: Instead of being in arms against each other , ought we not to be united ?
Parsing [sent. 1137 len. 44]: I have , therefore , one proposal to make to you , which is this : let the sentence go by vote , or ballot , if you please ; and whatever the sentence may be , I shall be guided by it .
Parsing [sent. 1138 len. 6]: Can I say more ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1139 len. 34]: `` My lads , '' replied Francisco , when the captain had done speaking , `` I think it better that you should accept this proposal rather than that blood should be shed .
Parsing [sent. 1140 len. 44]: My life is of little consequence ; say , then , will you agree to the vote , and submit to those laws , which , as the captain says , have been laid down to regulate the discipline of the vessel ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1141 len. 54]: The pirates on Francisco 's side looked round among their party , and , perceiving that they were the most numerous , consented to the proposal ; but Hawkhurst stepped forward and observed : `` Of course the Kroumen can have no votes , as they do not belong to the vessel . ''
Parsing [sent. 1142 len. 33]: This objection was important , as they amounted to twenty-five , and , after that number was deducted , in all probability , Francisco 's adherents would have been in the minority .
Parsing [sent. 1143 len. 16]: The pirates , with Francisco , objected , and again assumed the attitude of defence .
Parsing [sent. 1144 len. 36]: `` One moment , '' said Francisco , stepping in advance ; `` before this point is settled , I wish to take the sense of all of you as to another of your laws .
Parsing [sent. 1145 len. 31]: I ask you , Hawkhurst , and all who are now opposed to me , whether you have not one law , which is _ Blood for blood _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1146 len. 11]: `` Yes -- yes , '' shouted all the pirates .
Parsing [sent. 1147 len. 19]: `` Then let your captain stand forward , and answer to my charge , if he dares . ''
Parsing [sent. 1148 len. 15]: Cain curled his lip in derision , and walked within two yards of Francisco .
Parsing [sent. 1149 len. 16]: `` Well , boy , I 'm here ; and what is your charge ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1150 len. 36]: `` First -- I ask you , Captain Cain , who are so anxious that the laws should be enforced , whether you acknowledge that ` Blood for blood ' is a just law ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1151 len. 19]: `` Most just : and , when shed , the party who revenges is not amenable . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 1152 len. 20]: 'T is well : then villain that thou art , answer -- Didst thou not murder my mother ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1153 len. 8]: Cain , at this accusation , started .
Parsing [sent. 1154 len. 12]: `` Answer the truth , or lie like a recreant ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1155 len. 3]: repeated Francisco .
Parsing [sent. 1156 len. 9]: `` Did you not murder my mother ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1157 len. 19]: The captain 's lips and the muscles of his face quivered , but he did not reply . ''
Parsing [sent. 1158 len. 7]: _ Blood for blood _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1159 len. 20]: cried Francisco , as he fired his pistol at Cain , who staggered , and fell on the deck .
Parsing [sent. 1160 len. 15]: Hawkhurst and several of the pirates hastened to the captain , and raised him .
Parsing [sent. 1161 len. 25]: `` She must have told him last night , '' said Cain , speaking with difficulty , as the blood flowed from the wound .
Parsing [sent. 1162 len. 20]: `` He told me so himself , '' said Francisco , turning round to those who stood by him .
Parsing [sent. 1163 len. 8]: Cain was taken down into the cabin .
Parsing [sent. 1164 len. 21]: On examination , his wound was not mortal , although his loss of blood had been rapid and very great .
Parsing [sent. 1165 len. 13]: In a few minutes Hawkhurst joined the party on the quarter deck .
Parsing [sent. 1166 len. 84]: He found that the tide had turned more in Francisco 's favour than he had expected ; the law of `` Blood for blood '' was held most sacred : indeed , it was but the knowledge that it was solemnly recognised , and that , if one pirate wounded another , the other was at liberty to take his life , without punishment , which prevented constant affrays between parties , whose knives would otherwise have been the answer to every affront .
Parsing [sent. 1167 len. 18]: It was a more debased law of duelling , which kept such profligate associates on good terms .
Parsing [sent. 1168 len. 29]: Finding , therefore , that this feeling predominated , even among those who were opposed to Francisco on the other question , Hawkhurst thought it advisable to parley .
Parsing [sent. 1169 len. 48]: `` Hawkhurst , '' said Francisco , `` I have but one request to make , which , if complied with , will put an end to this contention ; it is , that you will put me on shore at the first land that we make .
Parsing [sent. 1170 len. 24]: If you and your party engage to do this , I will desire those who support me to return to their obedience . ''
Parsing [sent. 1171 len. 16]: `` I grant it , '' replied Hawkhurst ; `` and so will the others .
Parsing [sent. 1172 len. 8]: Will you not , my men ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1173 len. 32]: `` Agreed -- agreed upon all sides , '' cried the pirates , throwing away their weapons , and mingling with each other , as if they had never been opposed .
Parsing [sent. 1174 len. 19]: There is an old saying , that there is honour amongst thieves ; and so it often proves .
Parsing [sent. 1175 len. 31]: Every man in the vessel knew that this agreement would be strictly adhered to ; and Francisco now walked the deck with as much composure as if nothing had occurred .
Parsing [sent. 1176 len. 38]: Hawkhurst , who was aware that he must fulfil his promise , carefully examined the charts when he went down below , came up and altered the course of the schooner two points more to the northward .
Parsing [sent. 1177 len. 24]: The next morning he was up at the mast-head nearly half an hour , when he descended , and again altered the course .
Parsing [sent. 1178 len. 40]: By nine o'clock a low sandy island appeared on the lee bow ; when within half a mile of it , he ordered the schooner to be hove to , and lowered down the small boat from the stern .
Parsing [sent. 1179 len. 7]: He then turned the hands up .
Parsing [sent. 1180 len. 23]: `` My lads , we must keep our promise , to put Francisco on shore at the first land which we made .
Parsing [sent. 1181 len. 5]: There it is ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1182 len. 30]: And a malicious smile played on the miscreant 's features as he pointed out to them the barren sand-bank , which promised nothing but starvation and a lingering death .
Parsing [sent. 1183 len. 42]: Several of the crew murmured ; but Hawkhurst was supported by his own party , and had , moreover , taken the precaution quietly to remove all the arms , with the exception of those with which his adherents were provided .
Parsing [sent. 1184 len. 20]: `` An agreement is an agreement ; it is what he requested himself , and we promised to perform .
Parsing [sent. 1185 len. 5]: Send for Francisco . ''
Parsing [sent. 1186 len. 31]: `` I am here , Hawkhurst ; and I tell you candidly , that , desolate as is that barren spot , I prefer it to remaining in your company .
Parsing [sent. 1187 len. 9]: I will bring my chest up immediately . ''
Parsing [sent. 1188 len. 18]: `` No -- no ; that was not a part of the agreement , '' cried Hawkhurst .
Parsing [sent. 1189 len. 22]: `` Every man here has a right to his own property : I appeal to the whole of the crew . ''
Parsing [sent. 1190 len. 19]: `` True -- true , '' replied the pirates ; and Hawkhurst found himself again in the minority .
Parsing [sent. 1191 len. 6]: `` Be it so . ''
Parsing [sent. 1192 len. 10]: The chest of Francisco was handed into the boat .
Parsing [sent. 1193 len. 6]: `` Is that all ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1194 len. 3]: cried Hawkhurst .
Parsing [sent. 1195 len. 14]: `` My lads , am I to have no provisions or water ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1196 len. 3]: inquired Francisco .
Parsing [sent. 1197 len. 7]: `` No , '' replied Hawkhurst .
Parsing [sent. 1198 len. 12]: `` Yes -- yes , '' cried most of the pirates .
Parsing [sent. 1199 len. 15]: Hawkhurst did not dare put it to the vote ; he turned sulkily away .
Parsing [sent. 1200 len. 15]: The Kroumen brought up two breakers of water , and some pieces of pork .
Parsing [sent. 1201 len. 19]: `` Here , massa , '' said Pompey , putting into Francisco 's hand a fishing-line with hooks .
Parsing [sent. 1202 len. 24]: `` Thank you , Pompey ; but I had forgot -- that book in the cabin -- you know which I mean . ''
Parsing [sent. 1203 len. 24]: Pompey nodded his head , and went below ; but it was some time before he returned , during which Hawkhurst became impatient .
Parsing [sent. 1204 len. 41]: It was a very small boat which had been lowered down ; it had a lug-sail and two pair of sculls in it , and was quite full when Francisco 's chest and the other articles had been put in .
Parsing [sent. 1205 len. 3]: `` Come !
Parsing [sent. 1206 len. 17]: I have no time to wait , '' said Hawkhurst ; `` in the boat ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1207 len. 16]: Francisco shook hands with many of the crew , and wished all of them farewell .
Parsing [sent. 1208 len. 30]: Indeed , now that they beheld the poor lad about to be cast on the desolate island , even those most opposed to him felt some emotions of pity .
Parsing [sent. 1209 len. 27]: Although they acknowledged that his absence was necessary , yet they knew his determined courage ; and with them that quality was always a strong appeal .
Parsing [sent. 1210 len. 15]: `` Who will row this lad ashore , and bring the boat off ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1211 len. 17]: `` Not I , '' replied one ; `` it would haunt me ever afterwards . ''
Parsing [sent. 1212 len. 12]: So they all appeared to think , for no one volunteered .
Parsing [sent. 1213 len. 6]: Francisco jumped into the boat .
Parsing [sent. 1214 len. 23]: `` There is no room for any one but me ; and I will row myself on shore , '' cried he .
Parsing [sent. 1215 len. 6]: `` Farewell , my lads !
Parsing [sent. 1216 len. 3]: farewell ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1217 len. 3]: `` Stop ?
Parsing [sent. 1218 len. 21]: not so ; he must not have the boat -- he may escape from the island , '' cried Hawkhurst .
Parsing [sent. 1219 len. 11]: `` And why should n't he , poor fellow ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1220 len. 4]: replied the men .
Parsing [sent. 1221 len. 8]: `` Let him have the boat . ''
Parsing [sent. 1222 len. 18]: `` Yes -- yes , let him have the boat ; '' and Hawkhurst was again overruled .
Parsing [sent. 1223 len. 11]: `` Here , Massa Francisco -- here de book . ''
Parsing [sent. 1224 len. 8]: `` What 's that , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1225 len. 12]: cried Hawkhurst , snatching the book out of Pompey 's hand .
Parsing [sent. 1226 len. 8]: `` Him , massa , Bible . ''
Parsing [sent. 1227 len. 6]: Francisco waited for the book .
Parsing [sent. 1228 len. 5]: `` Shove off ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1229 len. 3]: cried Hawkhurst .
Parsing [sent. 1230 len. 10]: `` Give me my book , Mr Hawkhurst ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1231 len. 4]: `` No ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1232 len. 19]: replied the malignant rascal , tossing the Bible over the taffrail ; `` he shall not have that .
Parsing [sent. 1233 len. 17]: I 've heard say that _ there is consolation in it for the afflicted _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 1234 len. 35]: Francisco shoved off his boat , and seizing his sculls , pushed astern , picked up the book , which still floated , and laid it to dry on the after-thwart of the boat .
Parsing [sent. 1235 len. 8]: He then pulled in for the shore .
Parsing [sent. 1236 len. 23]: In the meantime the schooner had let draw her fore-sheet , and had already left him a quarter of a mile astern .
Parsing [sent. 1237 len. 13]: Before Francisco had gained the sand-bank she was hull-down to the northward .
Parsing [sent. 1238 len. 3]: CHAPTER TEN .
Parsing [sent. 1239 len. 3]: THE SAND-BANK .
Parsing [sent. 1240 len. 24]: The first half hour that Francisco was on this desolate spot he watched the receding schooner : his thoughts were unconnected and vague .
Parsing [sent. 1241 len. 96]: Wandering through the various scenes which had passed on the decks of that vessel , and recalling to his memory the different characters of those on board of her , much as he had longed to quit her -- disgusted as he had been with those with whom he had been forced to associate -- still , as her sails grew fainter and fainter to his view , as she increased her distance , he more than once felt that even remaining on board of her would have been preferable to his present deserted lot .
Parsing [sent. 1242 len. 6]: `` No , no ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1243 len. 31]: exclaimed he , after a little further reflection , `` I had rather perish here , than continue to witness the scenes which I have been forced to behold . ''
Parsing [sent. 1244 len. 61]: He once more fixed his eyes upon her white sails , and then sat down on the loose sand , and remained in deep and melancholy reverie until the scorching heat reminded him of his situation ; he afterwards rose and turned his thoughts upon his present situation , and to what would be the measures most advisable to take .
Parsing [sent. 1245 len. 73]: He hauled his little boat still farther on the beach , and attached the painter to one of the oars , which he fixed deep in the sand ; he then proceeded to survey the bank , and found that but a small portion was uncovered at high water ; for trifling as was the rise of the tide , the bank was so low that the water flowed almost over it .
Parsing [sent. 1246 len. 27]: The most elevated part was not more than fifteen feet above high-water mark , and that was a small knoll of about fifty feet in circumference .
Parsing [sent. 1247 len. 59]: To this part he resolved to remove his effects : he returned to the boat , and having lifted out his chest , the water , the provisions , with the other articles which he had obtained , he dragged them up , one by one , until they were all collected at the spot he had chosen .
Parsing [sent. 1248 len. 22]: He then took out of the boat the oars and little sail , which , fortunately , had remained in her .
Parsing [sent. 1249 len. 49]: His last object , to haul the little boat up to the same spot , was one which demanded all his exertion ; but , after considerable fatigue , he contrived , by first lifting round her bow , and then her stern , to effect his object .
Parsing [sent. 1250 len. 18]: Tired and exhausted , he then repaired to one of the breakers of water and refreshed himself .
Parsing [sent. 1251 len. 20]: The heat , as the day advanced , had become intolerable ; but it stimulated him to fresh exertion .
Parsing [sent. 1252 len. 65]: He turned over the boat , and contrived that the bow and stern should rest upon two little hillocks , so as to raise it above the level of the sand beneath it two or three feet ; he spread out the sail from the keel above , with the thole-pins as pegs , so as to keep off the rays of the sun .
Parsing [sent. 1253 len. 56]: Dragging the breakers of water and the provisions underneath the boat , he left his chest outside ; and having thus formed for himself a sort of covering which would protect him from the heat of the day and the damp of the night , he crept in , to shelter himself until the evening .
Parsing [sent. 1254 len. 17]: Although Francisco had not been on deck , he knew pretty well whereabouts he then was .
Parsing [sent. 1255 len. 27]: Taking out a chart from his chest , he examined the coast to ascertain the probable distance which he might be from any prospect of succour .
Parsing [sent. 1256 len. 45]: He calculated that he was on one of a patch of sand-banks off the coast of Loango , and about seven hundred miles from the Isle of St. Thomas -- the nearest place where he might expect to fall in with a European face .
Parsing [sent. 1257 len. 34]: From the coast he felt certain that he could not be more than forty or fifty miles at the most ; but could he trust himself among the savage natives who inhabited it ?
Parsing [sent. 1258 len. 79]: He knew how ill they had been treated by Europeans ; for at that period , it was quite as common for the slave-trader to land and take away the inhabitants as slaves by force , as to purchase them in the more northern territories : still , he might be fortunate enough to fall in with some trader on the coast , as there were a few who still carried on a barter for gold-dust and ivory .
Parsing [sent. 1259 len. 28]: We do not know -- we can not conceive a situation much more deplorable than the one we have just described to have been that of Francisco .
Parsing [sent. 1260 len. 62]: Alone -- without a chance of assistance -- with only a sufficiency of food for a few days , and cut off from the rest of his fellow-creatures , with only so much _ terra firma _ as would prevent his being swallowed up by the vast , unfathomable ocean , into which the horizon fell on every side around him !
Parsing [sent. 1261 len. 8]: And his chance of escape how small !
Parsing [sent. 1262 len. 36]: Hundreds of miles from any from whom he might expect assistance , and the only means of reaching them a small boat -- a mere cockleshell , which the first rough gale would inevitably destroy .
Parsing [sent. 1263 len. 19]: Such , indeed , were the first thoughts of Francisco ; but he soon recovered from his despondency .
Parsing [sent. 1264 len. 57]: He was young , courageous , and buoyant with hope ; and there is a feeling of pride -- of trust in our own resources and exertions , which increases and stimulates us in proportion to our danger and difficulty ; it is the daring of the soul , proving its celestial origin and eternal duration .
Parsing [sent. 1265 len. 51]: So intense was the heat that Francisco almost panted for sufficient air to support life , as he lay under the shade of the boat during the whole of that day ; not a breath of wind disturbed the glassy wave -- all nature appeared hushed into one horrible calm .
Parsing [sent. 1266 len. 43]: It was not until the shades of night were covering the solitude that Francisco ventured forth from his retreat ; but he found little relief ; there was an unnatural closeness in the air -- a suffocation unusual even in those climes .
Parsing [sent. 1267 len. 31]: Francisco cast his eyes up to the vault of heaven , and was astonished to find that there were no stars visible -- a grey mist covered the whole firmament .
Parsing [sent. 1268 len. 29]: He directed his view downwards to the horizon , and that , too , was not to be defined ; there was a dark bank all around it .
Parsing [sent. 1269 len. 34]: He walked to the edge of the sand-bank ; there was not even a ripple -- the wide ocean appeared to be in a trance , in a state of lethargy or stupor .
Parsing [sent. 1270 len. 33]: He parted the hair from his feverish brow , and once more surveying the horrible , lifeless , stagnant waste , his soul sickened , and he cast himself upon the sand .
Parsing [sent. 1271 len. 14]: There he lay for many hours in a state bordering upon wild despair .
Parsing [sent. 1272 len. 25]: At last he recovered himself , and , rising to his knees , he prayed for strength and submission to the will of Heaven .
Parsing [sent. 1273 len. 26]: When he was once more upon his feet , and had again scanned the ocean , he perceived that there was a change rapidly approaching .
Parsing [sent. 1274 len. 43]: The dark bank on the horizon had now risen higher up ; the opaqueness was everywhere more dense ; and low murmurs were heard , as if there was wind stirring aloft , although the sea was still glassy as a lake .
Parsing [sent. 1275 len. 19]: Signs of some movement about to take place were evident , and the solitary youth watched and watched .
Parsing [sent. 1276 len. 23]: And now the sounds increased , and here and there a wild thread of air -- whence coming , who could tell ?
Parsing [sent. 1277 len. 19]: and as rapidly disappearing -- would ruffle , for a second , a portion of the stagnant sea .
Parsing [sent. 1278 len. 44]: Then came whizzing sounds and moans , and then the rumbling noise of distant thunder -- loud and louder yet -- still louder -- a broad black line is seen sweeping along the expanse of water -- fearful in its rapidity it comes !
Parsing [sent. 1279 len. 25]: -- and the hurricane burst , at once and with all its force , and all its terrific sounds , upon the isolated Francisco .
Parsing [sent. 1280 len. 70]: The first blast was so powerful and so unexpected that it threw him down , and prudence dictated to him to remain in that position , for the loose sand was swept off and whirled in such force as to blind and prevent his seeing a foot from him ; he would have crawled to the boat for security , but he knew not in which direction to proceed .
Parsing [sent. 1281 len. 34]: But this did not last ; for now the water was borne up upon the strong wings of the hurricane , and the sand was rendered firm by its saturation with the element .
Parsing [sent. 1282 len. 13]: Francisco felt that he was drenched , and he raised his head .
Parsing [sent. 1283 len. 88]: All he could discover was , that the firmament was mantled with darkness , horrible from its intensity , and that the sea was in one extended foam -- boiling everywhere , and white as milk -- but still smooth , as if the power of the wind had compelled it to be so ; but the water had encroached , and one half the sand-bank was covered with it , while over the other the foam whirled , each portion chasing the other with wild rapidity .
Parsing [sent. 1284 len. 43]: And now the windows of heaven were opened , and the rain , mingled with the spray caught up by the hurricane , was dashed and hurled upon the forlorn youth , who still lay where he had been first thrown down .
Parsing [sent. 1285 len. 91]: But of a sudden , a wash of water told him that he could remain there no longer : the sea was rising -- rising fast ; and before he could gain a few paces on his hands and knees , another wave , as if it chased him in its wrath , repeated the warning of his extreme danger , and he was obliged to rise on his feet and hasten to the high part of the sand-bank , where he had drawn up his boat and his provisions .
Parsing [sent. 1286 len. 15]: Blinded as he was by the rain and spray , he could distinguish nothing .
Parsing [sent. 1287 len. 27]: Of a sudden , he fell violently ; he had stumbled over one of the breakers of water , and his head struck against a sea-chest .
Parsing [sent. 1288 len. 8]: Where , then , was the boat ?
Parsing [sent. 1289 len. 4]: It was gone !
Parsing [sent. 1290 len. 14]: -- it must have been swept away by the fury of the wind .
Parsing [sent. 1291 len. 9]: Alas , then , all chance was over !
Parsing [sent. 1292 len. 28]: and , if not washed away by the angry waters , he had but to prolong his existence but a few days , and then to die .
Parsing [sent. 1293 len. 40]: The effect of the blow he had received on his forehead , with the shock of mind occasioned by the disappearance of the boat , overpowered him , and he remained for some time in a state of insensibility .
Parsing [sent. 1294 len. 35]: When Francisco recovered , the scene was again changed : the wide expanse was now in a state of wild and fearful commotion , and the water roared as loud as did the hurricane .
Parsing [sent. 1295 len. 51]: The whole sand-bank , with the exception of that part on which he stood , was now covered with tumultuous foam , and his place of refuge was occasionally invaded , when some vast mass , o'erlording the other waves , expended all its fury , even to his feet .
Parsing [sent. 1296 len. 5]: Francisco prepared to die !
Parsing [sent. 1297 len. 26]: But gradually the darkness of the heavens disappeared , and there was no longer a bank upon the horizon , and Francisco hoped -- alas !
Parsing [sent. 1298 len. 3]: hoped what ?
Parsing [sent. 1299 len. 104]: -- that he might be saved from the present impending death to be reserved for one still more horrible ; to be saved from the fury of the waves , which would swallow him up , and in a few seconds remove him from all pain and suffering , to perish for want of sustenance under a burning sun ; to be withered -- to be parched to death -- calling in his agony for water ; and as Francisco thought of this he covered his face with his hands , and prayed , `` Oh , God , thy will be done !
Parsing [sent. 1300 len. 14]: but in thy mercy , raise , still higher raise the waters ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1301 len. 8]: But the waters did not rise higher .
Parsing [sent. 1302 len. 28]: The howling of the wind gradually decreased , and the foaming seas had obeyed the Divine injunction -- they had gone so far , but no farther !
Parsing [sent. 1303 len. 49]: And the day dawned , and the sky cleared : and the first red tints , announcing the return of light and heat , had appeared on the broken horizon , when the eyes of the despairing youth were directed to a black mass on the tumultuous waters .
Parsing [sent. 1304 len. 50]: It was a vessel , with but one mast standing , rolling heavily , and running before the gale right on for the sand-bank where he stood ; her hull , one moment borne aloft and the next disappearing from his view in the hollow of the agitated waters .
Parsing [sent. 1305 len. 9]: `` She will be dashed to pieces ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1306 len. 9]: thought Francisco ; `` she will be lost !
Parsing [sent. 1307 len. 9]: -- they can not see the bank ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1308 len. 32]: And he would have made a signal to her , if he had been able , to warn her of her danger , forgetting at the time his own desolate situation .
Parsing [sent. 1309 len. 19]: As Francisco watched , the sun rose , bright and joyous over this scene of anxiety and pain .
Parsing [sent. 1310 len. 23]: On came the vessel , flying before the gale , while the seas chased her as if they would fain overwhelm her .
Parsing [sent. 1311 len. 18]: It was fearful to see her scud -- agonising to know that she was rushing to destruction .
Parsing [sent. 1312 len. 9]: At last he could distinguish those on board .
Parsing [sent. 1313 len. 24]: He waved his hand , but they perceived him not ; he shouted , but his voice was borne away by the gale .
Parsing [sent. 1314 len. 9]: On came the vessel , as if doomed .
Parsing [sent. 1315 len. 18]: She was within two cables ' length of the bank when those on board perceived their danger .
Parsing [sent. 1316 len. 5]: It was too late !
Parsing [sent. 1317 len. 18]: -- they had rounded her to -- another , and another wave hurled her towards the sand .
Parsing [sent. 1318 len. 3]: She struck !
Parsing [sent. 1319 len. 25]: -- her only remaining mast fell over the side , and the roaring waves hastened to complete their work of destruction and of death !
Parsing [sent. 1320 len. 3]: CHAPTER ELEVEN .
Parsing [sent. 1321 len. 3]: THE ESCAPE .
Parsing [sent. 1322 len. 19]: Francisco 's eyes were fixed upon the vessel , over which the sea now broke with terrific violence .
Parsing [sent. 1323 len. 21]: There appeared to be about eight or nine men on her deck , who sheltered themselves under the weather bulwarks .
Parsing [sent. 1324 len. 31]: Each wave , as it broke against her side and then dashed in foam over her , threw her , with a convulsive jerk , still further on the sand-bank .
Parsing [sent. 1325 len. 20]: At last she was so high up that their fury was partly spent before they dashed against her frame .
Parsing [sent. 1326 len. 89]: Had the vessel been strong and well built -- had she been a collier coasting the English shores -- there was a fair chance that she might have withstood the fury of the storm until it had subsided , and that by remaining on board , the crew might have survived : but she was of a very different mould , and , as Francisco justly surmised , an American brig , built for swift sailing , very sharp , and , moreover , very slightly put together .
Parsing [sent. 1327 len. 37]: Francisco 's eyes , as may easily be supposed , were never removed from the only object which could now interest him -- the unexpected appearance and imminent danger of his fellow-creatures at this desolate spot .
Parsing [sent. 1328 len. 58]: He perceived that two of the men went to the hatches , and slid them over to leeward : they then descended , and although the seas broke over the vessel , and a large quantity of water must have poured into her , the hatches were not put on again by those who remained on deck .
Parsing [sent. 1329 len. 38]: But in a few minutes this mystery was solved ; one after another , at first , and then by dozens , poured forth , out of the hold , the kidnapped Africans who composed her cargo .
Parsing [sent. 1330 len. 39]: In a short time the decks were covered with them : the poor creatures had been released by the humanity of two English sailors , that they might have the same chance with themselves of saving their lives .
Parsing [sent. 1331 len. 11]: Still , no attempt was made to quit the vessel .
Parsing [sent. 1332 len. 66]: Huddled together , like a flock of sheep , with the wild waves breaking over them , there they all remained , both European and African ; and as the heavy blows of the seas upon the sides of the vessel careened and shook her , they were seen to cling , in every direction , with no distinction between the captured and their oppressors .
Parsing [sent. 1333 len. 44]: But this scene was soon changed ; the frame of the vessel could no longer withstand the violence of the waves , and as Francisco watched , of a sudden it was seen to divide a-midships , and each portion to turn over .
Parsing [sent. 1334 len. 43]: Then was the struggle for life ; hundreds were floating on the raging element , and wrestling for existence , and the white foam of the ocean was dotted by the black heads of the negroes who attempted to gain the bank .
Parsing [sent. 1335 len. 30]: It was an awful , terrible scene , to witness so many at one moment tossed and dashed about by the waves -- so many fellow-beings threatened with eternity .
Parsing [sent. 1336 len. 51]: At one moment they were close to the beach , forced on to it by some tremendous wave ; at the next , the receding water and the undertow swept them all back ; and of the many who had been swimming one half had disappeared to rise no more .
Parsing [sent. 1337 len. 21]: Francisco watched with agony as he perceived that the number decreased , and that none had yet gained the shore .
Parsing [sent. 1338 len. 39]: At last he snatched up the haulyards of his boat 's sail which were near him , and hastened down to the spot to afford such succour as might be possible ; nor were his efforts in vain .
Parsing [sent. 1339 len. 59]: As the seas washed the apparently inanimate bodies on shore , and would then have again swept them away to return them in mockery , he caught hold of them and dragged them safe on the bank , and thus did he continue his exertions until fifteen of the bodies of the negroes were spread upon the beach .
Parsing [sent. 1340 len. 46]: Although exhausted and senseless , they were not dead , and long before he had dragged up the last of the number , many of those previously saved had , without any other assistance than the heat of the sun , recovered from their insensibility .
Parsing [sent. 1341 len. 57]: Francisco would have continued his task of humanity , but the parted vessel had now been riven into fragments by the force of the waves , and the whole beach was strewed with her timbers and her stores , which were dashed on shore by the waters , and then swept back again by the return .
Parsing [sent. 1342 len. 34]: In a short time the severe blows he received from these fragments disabled him from further exertion , and he sank exhausted on the sand ; indeed , all further attempts were useless .
Parsing [sent. 1343 len. 29]: All on board the vessel had been launched into the sea at the same moment , and those who were not now on shore were past all succour .
Parsing [sent. 1344 len. 33]: Francisco walked up to those who had been saved : he found twelve of them were recovered and sitting on their hams ; the rest were still in a state of insensibility .
Parsing [sent. 1345 len. 29]: He then went up to the knoll , where his chest and provisions had been placed , and , throwing himself down by them , surveyed the scene .
Parsing [sent. 1346 len. 18]: The wind had lulled , the sun shone brightly , and the sea was much less violent .
Parsing [sent. 1347 len. 43]: The waves had subsided , and , no longer hurried on by the force of the hurricane , broke majestically , and solemnly , but not with the wildness and force which , but a few hours before , they had displayed .
Parsing [sent. 1348 len. 47]: The whole of the beach was strewed with the fragments of the vessel , with spars and water-casks ; and at every moment was to be observed the corpse of a negro turning round and round in the froth of the wave , and then disappearing .
Parsing [sent. 1349 len. 97]: For an hour did he watch and reflect and then he walked again to where the men who had been rescued were sitting , not more than thirty yards from him ; they were sickly , emaciated forms , but belonging to a tribe who inhabited the coast , and who having been accustomed from their infancy to be all the day in the water , had supported themselves better than the other slaves , who had been procured from the interior , or the European crew of the vessel , all of whom had perished .
Parsing [sent. 1350 len. 29]: The Africans appeared to recover fast by the heat of the sun , so oppressive to Francisco , and were now exchanging a few words with each other .
Parsing [sent. 1351 len. 22]: The whole of them had revived , but those who were most in need of aid were neglected by the others .
Parsing [sent. 1352 len. 12]: Francisco made signs to them , but they understood him not .
Parsing [sent. 1353 len. 24]: He returned to the knoll , and pouring out water into a tin pan from the breaker , brought it down to them .
Parsing [sent. 1354 len. 24]: He offered it to one , who seized it eagerly ; water was a luxury seldom obtained in the hold of a slave-vessel .
Parsing [sent. 1355 len. 26]: The man drank deeply , and would have drained the cup , but Francisco prevented him , and held it to the lips of another .
Parsing [sent. 1356 len. 48]: He was obliged to refill it three times before they had all been supplied : he then brought them a handful of biscuit , and left them , for he reflected that , without some precautions , the whole sustenance would be seized by them and devoured .
Parsing [sent. 1357 len. 49]: He buried half a foot deep , and covered over with sand , the breakers of water and the provisions , and by the time he had finished this task , unperceived by the negroes , who still squatted together , the sun had sunk below the horizon .
Parsing [sent. 1358 len. 37]: Francisco had already matured his plans , which were , to form a raft out of the fragments of the vessel , and , with the assistance of the negroes , attempt to gain the mainland .
Parsing [sent. 1359 len. 31]: He lay down , for the second night , on this eventful spot of desolation , and commending himself to the Almighty protection , was soon in a deep slumber .
Parsing [sent. 1360 len. 46]: It was not until the powerful rays of the sun blazed on the eyes of the youth that he awoke , so tired had he been with the anxiety and fatigue of the preceding day , and the sleepless harrowing night which had introduced it .
Parsing [sent. 1361 len. 19]: He rose and seated himself upon his sea-chest : how different was the scene from that of yesterday !
Parsing [sent. 1362 len. 70]: Again the ocean slept , the sky was serene , and not a cloud to be distinguished throughout the whole firmament ; the horizontal line was clear , even , and well defined : a soft breeze just rippled over the dark blue sea , which now had retired to its former boundary , and left the sand-bank as extended as when first Francisco had been put on shore .
Parsing [sent. 1363 len. 67]: But here the beauty of the landscape terminated : the foreground was horrible to look upon ; the whole of the beach was covered with the timbers of the wreck , with water-casks , and other articles , in some parts heaped and thrown up one upon another ; and among them lay , jammed and mangled , the bodies of the many who had perished .
Parsing [sent. 1364 len. 32]: In other parts there were corpses thrown up high and dry , or still rolling and turning to the rippling wave : it was a scene of desolation and of death .
Parsing [sent. 1365 len. 47]: The negroes who had been saved were all huddled up together , apparently in deep sleep , and Francisco quitted his elevated position and walked down to the low beach , to survey the means which the disaster of others afforded him for his own escape .
Parsing [sent. 1366 len. 60]: To his great joy he found not only plenty of casks , but many of them full of fresh water , provisions also in sufficiency , and , indeed , everything that could be required to form a raft , as well as the means of support for a considerable time for himself and the negroes who had survived .
Parsing [sent. 1367 len. 20]: He then walked up to them and called to them , but they answered not , nor even moved .
Parsing [sent. 1368 len. 26]: He pushed them , but in vain ; and his heart beat quick , for he was fearful that they were dead from previous exhaustion .
Parsing [sent. 1369 len. 45]: He applied his foot to one of them , and it was not until he had used force , which in any other case he would have dispensed with , that the negro awoke from his state of lethargy and looked vacantly about him .
Parsing [sent. 1370 len. 21]: Francisco had some little knowledge of the language of the Kroumen , and he addressed the negro in that tongue .
Parsing [sent. 1371 len. 30]: To his great joy , he was answered in a language which , if not the same , had so great an affinity to it that communication became easy .
Parsing [sent. 1372 len. 28]: With the assistance of the negro , who used still less ceremony with his comrades , the remainder of them were awakened , and a palaver ensued .
Parsing [sent. 1373 len. 44]: Francisco soon made them understand that they were to make a raft and go back to their own country ; explaining to them that if they remained there , the water and provisions would soon be exhausted , and they would all perish .
Parsing [sent. 1374 len. 55]: The poor creatures hardly knew whether to consider him a supernatural being or not ; they talked among themselves ; they remarked at his having brought them fresh water the day before ; they knew that he did not belong to the vessel in which they had been wrecked , and they were puzzled .
Parsing [sent. 1375 len. 34]: Whatever might be their speculations , they had one good effect , which was , that they looked upon the youth as a superior and a friend , and most willingly obeyed him .
Parsing [sent. 1376 len. 27]: He led them up to the knoll , and , desiring them to scrape away the sand , supplied them again with fresh water and biscuit .
Parsing [sent. 1377 len. 24]: Perhaps the very supply , and the way in which it was given to them , excited their astonishment as much as anything .
Parsing [sent. 1378 len. 24]: Francisco ate with them , and , selecting from his sea-chest the few tools in his possession , desired them to follow him .
Parsing [sent. 1379 len. 73]: The casks were collected and rolled up ; the empty ones arranged for the raft : the spars were hauled up and cleared of the rigging , which was carefully separated for lashings ; the one or two sails which had been found rolled up on the spars were spread out to dry ; and the provisions and articles of clothing , which might be useful , laid together on one side .
Parsing [sent. 1380 len. 45]: The negroes worked willingly , and showed much intelligence : before the evening closed , everything which might be available was secured , and the waves now only tossed about lifeless forms , and the small fragments of timber which could not be serviceable .
Parsing [sent. 1381 len. 31]: It would occupy too much time were we to detail all the proceedings of Francisco and the negroes for the space of four days , during which they laboured hard .
Parsing [sent. 1382 len. 42]: Necessity is truly the mother of invention , and many were the ingenious resources of the party before they could succeed in forming a raft large enough to carry them and their provisions , with a mast and sail well secured .
Parsing [sent. 1383 len. 61]: At length it was accomplished ; and on the fifth day , Francisco and his men embarked ; and , having pushed clear of the bank with poles , they were at last able to hoist their sail to a fine breeze , and steer for the coast before the wind at the rate of about three miles an hour .
Parsing [sent. 1384 len. 48]: But it was not until they had gained half a mile from the bank that they were no longer annoyed by the dreadful smell arising from the putrefaction of so many bodies , for to bury them all would have been a work of too great time .
Parsing [sent. 1385 len. 33]: The last two days of their remaining on the island , the effluvia had become so powerful as to be a source of the greatest horror and disgust even to the negroes .
Parsing [sent. 1386 len. 48]: But before night when the raft was about eight leagues from the sand-bank , it fell calm , and continued so for the next day , when a breeze sprang up from the south-east , to which they trimmed their sail with their head to the northward .
Parsing [sent. 1387 len. 56]: This wind , and the course steered , sent them off from the land , but there was no help for it ; and Francisco felt grateful that they had such an ample supply of provisions and water as to enable them to yield to a few days ' contrary wind without danger of want .
Parsing [sent. 1388 len. 52]: But the breeze continued steady and fresh , and they were now crossing the Bight of Benin ; the weather was fine and the sea smooth ; the flying-fish rose in shoals , and dropped down into the raft , which still forced its way through the water to the northward .
Parsing [sent. 1389 len. 24]: Thus did Francisco and his negro crew remain for a fortnight floating on the wide ocean , without any object meeting their view .
Parsing [sent. 1390 len. 44]: Day after day it was the same dreary `` sky and water , '' and by the reckoning of Francisco they could not be far from the land , when , on the fifteenth day , they perceived two sails to the northward .
Parsing [sent. 1391 len. 46]: Francisco 's heart bounded with joy and gratitude to Heaven ; he had no telescope to examine them , but he steered directly for them , and , about dark , he made them out to be a ship and a schooner , hove to .
Parsing [sent. 1392 len. 43]: As Francisco scanned them , surmising what they might be , the sun set behind the two vessels , and after it had sunk below the horizon their forms were , for a few minutes , delineated with remarkable precision and clearness .
Parsing [sent. 1393 len. 6]: There could be no mistake .
Parsing [sent. 1394 len. 40]: Francisco felt convinced that the schooner was the _ Avenger _ ; and his first impulse was to run to the sweep with which they were steered , and put the head of the raft again to the northward .
Parsing [sent. 1395 len. 37]: A moment 's reflection determined him to act otherwise ; he lowered down his sail that he might escape observation , and watched the motions of the vessels during the few minutes of light which remained .
Parsing [sent. 1396 len. 28]: That the ship had been captured , and that her capture had been attended with the usual scene of outrage and violence , he had no doubt .
Parsing [sent. 1397 len. 32]: He was now about four miles from them , and just as they were vanishing from his straining eyes he perceived that the schooner had made all sail to the westward .
Parsing [sent. 1398 len. 53]: Francisco , feeling that he was then secure from being picked up by her , again hoisted his sail with the hope of reaching the ship , which , if not scuttled , he intended to remove on board of , and then make sail for the first port on the coast .
Parsing [sent. 1399 len. 28]: But hardly had the raft regained her way when the horizon was lighted up , and he perceived that the pirates had set fire to the vessel .
Parsing [sent. 1400 len. 55]: Then it was useless to proceed towards her ; and Francisco again thought of putting the head of the raft to the northward , when the idea struck him , knowing the character and cruelty of the pirates , that there might be some unfortunate people left on board to perish in the flames .
Parsing [sent. 1401 len. 30]: He therefore continued his course , watching the burning vessel ; the flames increased in violence , mounting up to the masts and catching the sails one after another .
Parsing [sent. 1402 len. 26]: The wind blew fresh , and the vessel was kept before the wind -- a circumstance that assured Francisco that there were people on board .
Parsing [sent. 1403 len. 48]: At first she appeared to leave the raft , but as her sails , one after another , were consumed by the element , so did she decrease her speed , and Francisco , in about an hour , was close to her and under her counter .
Parsing [sent. 1404 len. 114]: The ship was now one mass of fire from her bows to her mainmast ; a volume of flame poured from her main hold , rising higher than her lower masts , and ending in a huge mass of smoke carried by the wind ahead of her ; the quarter-deck was still free from fire , but the heat on it was so intense that those on board were all collected at the taffrail ; and there they remained , some violent , others in mute despair ; for the _ Avenger 's _ people , in their barbarity , had cut away and destroyed all the boats , to prevent their escape .
Parsing [sent. 1405 len. 56]: From the light thrown round the vessel , those on board had perceived the approach of Francisco to their rescue , and immediately that it was under the counter , and the sail lowered , almost all of them had descended by ropes , or the stern ladder , and gained a place in her .
Parsing [sent. 1406 len. 47]: In a few minutes , without scarcely an exchange of a word , they were all out of the brig , and Francisco pushed off just as the flames burst from the cabin-windows , darting out in a horizontal line like the tongues of fiery serpents .
Parsing [sent. 1407 len. 47]: The raft , now encumbered with twelve more persons , was then steered to the northward ; and as soon as those who had been saved had been supplied with some water , which they so much needed , Francisco obtained the intelligence which he desired .
Parsing [sent. 1408 len. 29]: The ship was from Carthagena , South America ; had sailed from thence to Lisbon with a Don Cumanos , who had large property up the Magdalen river .
Parsing [sent. 1409 len. 29]: He had wished to visit a part of his family at Lisbon , and from thence had sailed to the Canary Isles , where he also had property .
Parsing [sent. 1410 len. 48]: In their way from Lisbon to South America they had been beaten by stress of weather to the southward , and afterwards had been chased by the _ Avenger _ ; being a very fast sailer she had run down several degrees before she had been captured .
Parsing [sent. 1411 len. 76]: When the pirate took possession , and found that she had little or no cargo of value to them , for her hold was chiefly filled with furniture and other articles for the use of Don Cumanos , angry at their disappointment , they had first destroyed all their boats and then set fire to the vessel , taking care not to leave her until all chance of the fire being put out was hopeless .
Parsing [sent. 1412 len. 13]: And thus had these miscreants left innocent and unfortunate people to perish .
Parsing [sent. 1413 len. 26]: Francisco heard the narrative of Don Cumanos , and then informed him in what manner he had left the schooner , and his subsequent adventures .
Parsing [sent. 1414 len. 17]: Francisco was now very anxious to make the land , or obtain succour from some vessel .
Parsing [sent. 1415 len. 28]: The many who were now on board , and the time that he had already been at sea , obliged him to reduce the allowance of water .
Parsing [sent. 1416 len. 25]: Fortune favoured him after all his trials ; on the third day a vessel hove in sight , and they were seen by her .
Parsing [sent. 1417 len. 13]: She made sail for them , and took them all on board .
Parsing [sent. 1418 len. 35]: It was a schooner trafficking on the coast for gold-dust and ivory ; but the magnificent offers of Don Cumanos induced them to give up their voyage and run across the Atlantic to Carthagena .
Parsing [sent. 1419 len. 22]: To Francisco it was of little moment where he went , and in Don Cumanos he had found a sincere friend .
Parsing [sent. 1420 len. 27]: `` You have been my preserver , '' said the Spaniard , `` allow me to return the obligation -- come and live with me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1421 len. 33]: As Francisco was equally pleased with Don Cumanos , he accepted the offer ; they all arrived safely at Carthagena , and from thence proceeded to his estate on the Magdalen river .
Parsing [sent. 1422 len. 3]: CHAPTER TWELVE .
Parsing [sent. 1423 len. 3]: THE LIEUTENANT .
Parsing [sent. 1424 len. 29]: When we last mentioned Edward Templemore , we stated that he was a lieutenant of the admiral 's ship on the West India station , commanding the tender .
Parsing [sent. 1425 len. 42]: Now the name of the tender was the _ Enterprise _ : and it was singular that she was one of two schooners built at Baltimore , remarkable for their beauty and good qualities ; yet how different were their employments !
Parsing [sent. 1426 len. 42]: Both had originally been built for the slave-trade ; now one hoisted the English pennant , and cruised as the _ Enterprise _ ; the other threw out the black flag , and scoured the seas as the _ Avenger _ .
Parsing [sent. 1427 len. 37]: The _ Enterprise _ was fitted much in the same way as we have already described her sister vessel -- that is , with one long brass gun amidships , and smaller ones for her broadside .
Parsing [sent. 1428 len. 34]: But in the numbers of their crew there was a great disparity ; the _ Enterprise _ not being manned with more than sixty-five English sailors , belonging to the admiral 's ship .
Parsing [sent. 1429 len. 60]: She was employed , as most admirals ' tenders usually _ were _ , sometimes carrying a tender made for a supply of provisions , or a tender of services , if required , from the admiral ; or , if not particularly wanted , with the important charge of a tender _ billet-doux _ to some fair friend .
Parsing [sent. 1430 len. 10]: But this is a tender subject to touch upon .
Parsing [sent. 1431 len. 69]: In the meantime it must be understood that she had the same commission to sink , burn , and destroy , as all other of his Majesty 's vessels , if anything came in her way ; but as she usually carried despatches , the real importance of which were , of course , unknown , she was not to go out of her way upon such service .
Parsing [sent. 1432 len. 65]: Edward Templemore did , however , occasionally go a little out of his way , and had lately captured a very fine privateer after a smart action , for which he anticipated his promotion ; but the admiral thought him too young , and therefore gave the next vacancy to his own nephew , who , the admiral quite forgot , was much younger .
Parsing [sent. 1433 len. 136]: Edward laughed when he heard of it , upon his arrival at Port Royal ; and the admiral , who expected that he would make his appearance pouting with disappointment , when he came up to the Penn to report himself , was so pleased with his good humour that he made a vow that Templemore should have the next vacancy ; but this he also quite forgot , because Edward happened to be , at the time it occurred , on a long cruise , -- and `` out of sight out of mind '' is a proverb so well established , that it may be urged as an excuse for a person who had so many other things to think of as the admiral entrusted with the command of the West India station .
Parsing [sent. 1434 len. 38]: Lieutenant Templemore had , in consequence , commanded the _ Enterprise _ for nearly two years , and without grumbling ; for he was of a happy disposition , and passed a very happy sort of life .
Parsing [sent. 1435 len. 37]: Mr Witherington was very indulgent to him , and allowed him to draw liberally ; he had plenty of money for himself or for a friend who required it , and he had plenty of amusement .
Parsing [sent. 1436 len. 134]: Amongst other diversions , he had fallen most desperately in love ; for , in one of his trips to the Leeward Isles -LRB- so called from their being to windward -RRB- he had succoured a Spanish vessel , which had on board the new Governor of Porto Rico , with his family , and had taken upon himself to land them on that island in safety ; for which service the English admiral received a handsome letter , concluding with the moderate wish that his Excellency might live a thousand years , and Edward Templemore an invitation to go and see them whenever he might pass that way ; which , like most general invitations , was as much a compliment as the wish which wound up the letter to the admiral .
Parsing [sent. 1437 len. 58]: It did , however , so happen that the Spanish governor had a very beautiful and only daughter , carefully guarded by a duenna , and a monk who was the depository of all the sins of the governor 's establishment ; and it was with this daughter that Edward Templemore fell into the heresy of love .
Parsing [sent. 1438 len. 21]: She was , indeed , very beautiful ; and , like all her countrywomen , was ardent in her affection .
Parsing [sent. 1439 len. 45]: The few days that she was on board the schooner with her father , during the time that the _ Enterprise _ convoyed the Spanish vessel into port , were quite sufficient to ignite two such inflammable beings as Clara d'Alfarez and Edward Templemore .
Parsing [sent. 1440 len. 48]: The monk had been left on board of the leaky vessel ; there was no accommodation in the schooner for him or the duenna , and Don Felix de Maxos de Cobas de Manilla d'Alfarez was too busy with his cigar to pay attention to his daughter .
Parsing [sent. 1441 len. 33]: When they were landed , Edward Templemore was asked to their residence , which was not in the town , but at a lovely bay on the south side of the island .
Parsing [sent. 1442 len. 36]: The town mansion was appropriated to business and the ceremony of the court : it was too hot for a permanent abode , and the governor only went there for a few hours each day .
Parsing [sent. 1443 len. 40]: Edward Templemore remained a short time at the island , and at his departure received the afore-mentioned letter from the father to the English admiral , and an assurance of unalterable fidelity from the daughter to the English lieutenant .
Parsing [sent. 1444 len. 17]: On his return he presented the letter , and the admiral was satisfied with his conduct .
Parsing [sent. 1445 len. 82]: When ordered out to cruise , which he always was when there was nothing else to do , he submitted to the admiral whether , if he should happen to be near Porto Rico , he could not leave an answer to the Spanish governor 's letter ; and the admiral , who knew the value of keeping up a good understanding with foreign relations , took the hint , and gave him one to deliver , if _ convenient _ .
Parsing [sent. 1446 len. 52]: The second meeting was , as may be supposed , more cordial than the first on the part of the young lady ; not so , however , on the part of the duenna and holy friar , who soon found out that their charge was in danger from heretical opinions .
Parsing [sent. 1447 len. 25]: Caution became necessary ; and as secrecy adds a charm to an amour , Clara received a long letter and a telescope from Edward .
Parsing [sent. 1448 len. 44]: The letter informed her that , whenever he could , he would make his appearance in his schooner off the south of the island , and await a signal made by her at a certain window , acknowledging her recognition of his vessel .
Parsing [sent. 1449 len. 20]: On the night of that signal he would land in his boat and meet her at an appointed spot .
Parsing [sent. 1450 len. 39]: This was all very delightful ; and it so happened that Edward had four or five times contrived , during the last year , to meet Clara without discovery , and again and again to exchange his vows .
Parsing [sent. 1451 len. 33]: It was agreed between them that when he quitted the station , she would quit her father and her home , and trust her future happiness to an Englishman and a heretic .
Parsing [sent. 1452 len. 72]: It may be a matter of surprise to some of our readers that the admiral should not have discovered the frequent visits of the _ Enterprise _ to Porto Rico , as Edward was obliged to bring his log for examination every time that he returned ; but the admiral was satisfied with Edward 's conduct , and his anxiety to cruise when there was nothing else for him to do .
Parsing [sent. 1453 len. 18]: His logs were brought on shore to the admiral 's secretary , carefully rolled and sealed up .
Parsing [sent. 1454 len. 66]: The admiral 's secretary threw the packages on one side , and thought no more of the matter , and Edward had always a ready story to tell when he took his seat at the admiral 's dinner-table ; besides , he is a very unfit person to command a vessel who does not know how to write a log that will bear an investigation .
Parsing [sent. 1455 len. 16]: A certain latitude is always allowed in every degree of latitude as well as longitude .
Parsing [sent. 1456 len. 49]: The Enterprise had been despatched to Antigua , and Edward thought this an excellent opportunity to pay a visit to Clara d'Alfarez : he therefore , upon his return , hove to off the usual headland , and soon perceived the white curtain thrown out of the window .
Parsing [sent. 1457 len. 48]: `` There it is , sir , '' said one of the midshipmen who was near him -- for he had been there so often that the whole crew of the Enterprise were aware of his attachment -- `` She has shown her flag of truce . ''
Parsing [sent. 1458 len. 27]: `` A truce to your nonsense , Mr Warren , '' replied Edward , laughing ; `` how came you to know anything about it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1459 len. 29]: `` I only judge by cause and effect , sir ; and I know that I shall have to go on shore and wait for you tonight . ''
Parsing [sent. 1460 len. 21]: `` That 's not unlikely ; but let draw the foresheet ; we must now get behind the headland . ''
Parsing [sent. 1461 len. 33]: The youngster was right : that evening , a little before dark , he attended his commander on shore , the _ Enterprise _ lying to with a lantern at her peak .
Parsing [sent. 1462 len. 8]: `` Once more , dearest Clara ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1463 len. 17]: said Edward , as he threw off her long veil and pressed her in his arms .
Parsing [sent. 1464 len. 34]: `` Yes , Edward , once more -- but I am afraid only once more ; for my maid , Inez , has been dangerously ill , and has confessed to Friar Ricardo .
Parsing [sent. 1465 len. 23]: I fear much that , in her fright -LRB- for she thought that she was dying -RRB- , she has told all .
Parsing [sent. 1466 len. 6]: She is better now . ''
Parsing [sent. 1467 len. 10]: `` Why should you imagine so , Clara ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1468 len. 18]: `` Oh , you know not what a frightened fool that Inez is when she is ill !
Parsing [sent. 1469 len. 8]: Our religion is not like yours . ''
Parsing [sent. 1470 len. 18]: `` No , dear , it is not ; but I will teach you a better . ''
Parsing [sent. 1471 len. 11]: `` Hush , Edward , you must not say that .
Parsing [sent. 1472 len. 3]: Holy Virgin !
Parsing [sent. 1473 len. 7]: if Friar Ricardo should hear you !
Parsing [sent. 1474 len. 20]: I think that Inez must have told him , for he fixes his dark eyes upon me so earnestly .
Parsing [sent. 1475 len. 12]: Yesterday he observed to me that I had not confessed . ''
Parsing [sent. 1476 len. 10]: `` Tell him to mind his own business . ''
Parsing [sent. 1477 len. 17]: `` That is his business , and I was obliged to confess to him last night .
Parsing [sent. 1478 len. 17]: I told him a great many things , and then he asked if that was all .
Parsing [sent. 1479 len. 6]: His eyes went through me .
Parsing [sent. 1480 len. 15]: I trembled as I uttered an untruth , for I said it was . ''
Parsing [sent. 1481 len. 12]: `` I confess my sins but to my Maker , Clara !
Parsing [sent. 1482 len. 9]: and I confess my love but to you .
Parsing [sent. 1483 len. 7]: Follow my plan , dearest ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1484 len. 9]: `` I will half obey you , Edward .
Parsing [sent. 1485 len. 8]: I will not tell my love . ''
Parsing [sent. 1486 len. 18]: `` And sins you have none , Clara ; so you will obey me in all . ''
Parsing [sent. 1487 len. 11]: `` Hush , Edward , you must not say that .
Parsing [sent. 1488 len. 9]: We all have sins ; and , oh !
Parsing [sent. 1489 len. 17]: what a grievous sin they say it is to love you , who are a heretic !
Parsing [sent. 1490 len. 6]: Holy Virgin , pardon me !
Parsing [sent. 1491 len. 8]: but I could not help it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1492 len. 18]: `` If that is your only sin , dearest , I can safely give you absolution . ''
Parsing [sent. 1493 len. 13]: `` Nay , Edward , do n't joke , but hear me .
Parsing [sent. 1494 len. 26]: If Inez has confessed , they will look for me here , and we must not meet again -- at least not in this place .
Parsing [sent. 1495 len. 34]: You know the little bay behind the rock , it is not much farther off , and there is a cave where I can wait : another time it must be there . ''
Parsing [sent. 1496 len. 17]: `` It shall be there , dearest ; but is it not too near the beach ?
Parsing [sent. 1497 len. 18]: will you not be afraid of the men in the boat , who must see you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1498 len. 8]: `` But we can leave the beach .
Parsing [sent. 1499 len. 16]: It is Ricardo alone that I am in dread of , and the Donna Maria .
Parsing [sent. 1500 len. 3]: Merciful Heaven !
Parsing [sent. 1501 len. 17]: should my father know all , we should be lost -- be separated for ever ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1502 len. 16]: and Clara laid her forehead on Edward 's shoulder , as her tears fell fast .
Parsing [sent. 1503 len. 9]: `` There is nought to fear , Clara .
Parsing [sent. 1504 len. 2]: Hush !
Parsing [sent. 1505 len. 8]: I heard a rustling in those orange-trees .
Parsing [sent. 1506 len. 3]: Listen ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1507 len. 3]: `` Yes !
Parsing [sent. 1508 len. 3]: yes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1509 len. 11]: whispered Clara , hastily ; `` there is some one .
Parsing [sent. 1510 len. 2]: Away !
Parsing [sent. 1511 len. 6]: dear Edward , away ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1512 len. 12]: Clara sprang from his side , and hastened up the grove .
Parsing [sent. 1513 len. 27]: Edward made his retreat , and flying down the rocky and narrow path through the underwood , was soon on the beach and into his boat .
Parsing [sent. 1514 len. 17]: The _ Enterprise _ arrived at head quarters , and Edward reported himself to the admiral .
Parsing [sent. 1515 len. 26]: `` I have work for you , Mr Templemore , '' said the admiral ; `` you must be ready to proceed on service immediately .
Parsing [sent. 1516 len. 7]: We 've found your match . ''
Parsing [sent. 1517 len. 15]: `` I hope I may find her , sir , '' replied the lieutenant .
Parsing [sent. 1518 len. 27]: `` I hope so , too ; for , if you give a good account of her , it will put another swab on your shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 1519 len. 50]: The pirate schooner , which has so long infested the Atlantic , has been seen and chased off Barbadoes by the _ Amelia _ : but it appears that there is not a vessel in the squadron which can come near her unless it be the _ Enterprise _ .
Parsing [sent. 1520 len. 20]: She has since captured two West Indiamen , and was seen steering with them towards the coast of Guiana .
Parsing [sent. 1521 len. 19]: Now , I am going to give you thirty additional hands , and send you after her . ''
Parsing [sent. 1522 len. 16]: `` Thank you , sir , '' replied Edward , his countenance beaming with delight .
Parsing [sent. 1523 len. 9]: `` How soon will you be ready ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1524 len. 4]: inquired the admiral .
Parsing [sent. 1525 len. 7]: `` To-morrow morning , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 1526 len. 4]: `` Very good .
Parsing [sent. 1527 len. 35]: Tell Mr Hadley to bring me the order for the men and your sailing orders , and I will sign them ; but recollect , Mr Templemore , you will have an awkward customer .
Parsing [sent. 1528 len. 11]: Be prudent -- brave I know you to be . ''
Parsing [sent. 1529 len. 35]: Edward Templemore promised everything , as most people do in such cases ; and before the next evening the _ Enterprise _ was well in the offing , under a heavy press of sail .
Parsing [sent. 1530 len. 3]: CHAPTER THIRTEEN .
Parsing [sent. 1531 len. 3]: THE LANDING .
Parsing [sent. 1532 len. 34]: The property of Don Cumanos , to which he had retired with his family , accompanied by Francisco , extended from the mouth of , to many miles up , the Magdalen river .
Parsing [sent. 1533 len. 22]: It was a fine alluvial soil , forming one vast strip of rich meadow , covered with numerous herds of cattle .
Parsing [sent. 1534 len. 64]: The house was not a hundreds yards from the bank of the magnificent stream , and a small but deep creek ran up to the adjacent buildings ; for Don Cumanos had property even more valuable , being proprietor of a gold mine near the town of Jambrano , about eight miles farther up , and which mine had latterly become exceedingly productive .
Parsing [sent. 1535 len. 25]: The ore was brought down the river in boats , and smelted in the outhouses near the creek to which we have just referred .
Parsing [sent. 1536 len. 33]: It will be necessary to observe that the establishment of the noble Spaniard was numerous , consisting of nearly one hundred persons , employed in the smelting-house or attached to the household .
Parsing [sent. 1537 len. 40]: For some time Francisco remained here happy and contented ; he had become the confidential supervisor of Don Cumanos ' household , proved himself worthy of a trust so important , and was considered as one of the family .
Parsing [sent. 1538 len. 89]: One morning , as Francisco was proceeding down to the smelting-house to open the hatches of the small deck boats which had arrived from Jambrano with ore , and which were invariably secured with a padlock by the superintendent above , to which Don Cumanos had a corresponding key , one of the chief men informed him that a vessel had anchored off the mouth of the river the day before , and weighed again early that morning , and that she was now standing off and on .
Parsing [sent. 1539 len. 13]: `` From Carthagena , probably , beating up , '' replied Francisco .
Parsing [sent. 1540 len. 56]: `` Valga me Dios , if I know that , sir , '' said Diego , `` I should have thought nothing about it ; but Giacomo and Pedro , who went out to fish last night , as usual , instead of coming back before midnight , have not been heard of since . ''
Parsing [sent. 1541 len. 3]: `` Indeed !
Parsing [sent. 1542 len. 4]: that is strange .
Parsing [sent. 1543 len. 9]: Did they ever stay so long before ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1544 len. 16]: `` Never , sir ; and they have fished together now for seven years . ''
Parsing [sent. 1545 len. 20]: Francisco gave the key to the man , who opened the locks of the hatches , and returned it .
Parsing [sent. 1546 len. 6]: `` There she is ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1547 len. 25]: cried the man ; the head-sails making their appearance as the vessel opened to their view from the projecting point distant about four miles .
Parsing [sent. 1548 len. 18]: Francisco directed his eye towards her , and , without further remark , hastened to the house .
Parsing [sent. 1549 len. 28]: `` Well , Francisco , '' said Don Cumanos , who was stirring a small cup of chocolate , `` what 's the news this morning ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1550 len. 24]: `` The _ Nostra Senora del Carmen _ and the _ Aguilla _ have arrived , and I have just unlocked the hatches .
Parsing [sent. 1551 len. 20]: There is a vessel off the point which requires examination , and I have come for the telescope . ''
Parsing [sent. 1552 len. 4]: `` Requires examination !
Parsing [sent. 1553 len. 5]: Why , Francisco ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1554 len. 25]: `` Because Giacomo and Pedro , who went fishing last night , have not returned , and there are no tidings of them . ''
Parsing [sent. 1555 len. 5]: `` That is strange !
Parsing [sent. 1556 len. 10]: But how is this connected with the vessel ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1557 len. 34]: `` That I will explain as soon as I have had an examination of her , '' replied Francisco , who had taken up the telescope , and was drawing out the tube .
Parsing [sent. 1558 len. 20]: Francisco fixed the glass against the sill of the window , and examined the vessel some time in silence .
Parsing [sent. 1559 len. 3]: `` Yes !
Parsing [sent. 1560 len. 29]: by the living God , it is the _ Avenger _ , and no other , '' exclaimed he , as he removed the telescope from his eye .
Parsing [sent. 1561 len. 4]: `` Eh ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1562 len. 4]: cried Don Cumanos .
Parsing [sent. 1563 len. 20]: `` It is the pirate vessel -- the _ Avenger _ -- I 'll forfeit my life upon it !
Parsing [sent. 1564 len. 8]: Don Cumanos , you must be prepared .
Parsing [sent. 1565 len. 31]: I know that they have long talked of a visit to this quarter , and anticipate great booty , and they have those on board who know the coast well .
Parsing [sent. 1566 len. 24]: The disappearance of your two men convinces me that they sent up their boats last night to reconnoitre , and have captured them .
Parsing [sent. 1567 len. 38]: Torture will extract the information which the pirates require , and I have little doubt but that the attack will be made , when they learn how much bullion there is at present on your premises . ''
Parsing [sent. 1568 len. 29]: `` You may be right , '' replied Don Cumanos , thoughtfully ; `` that is , provided you are sure that it is the pirate vessel . ''
Parsing [sent. 1569 len. 6]: `` Sure , Don Cumanos !
Parsing [sent. 1570 len. 22]: I know every timber and plank in her ; there is not a rope nor a block but I can recognise .
Parsing [sent. 1571 len. 44]: At the distance of four miles , with such a glass as this , I can discover every little variety in her rigging from other craft , I will swear to her , '' repeated Francisco , once more looking through the telescope .
Parsing [sent. 1572 len. 9]: `` And if they attack , Francisco ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1573 len. 15]: `` We must defend ourselves , and , I trust , beat them off .
Parsing [sent. 1574 len. 11]: They will come in their boats , and at night .
Parsing [sent. 1575 len. 24]: If they were to run in the schooner by daylight and anchor abreast of us , we should have but a poor chance .
Parsing [sent. 1576 len. 15]: But they little think that I am here , and that they are recognised .
Parsing [sent. 1577 len. 11]: They will attack this night , I rather think . ''
Parsing [sent. 1578 len. 11]: `` And what do you then propose , Francisco ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1579 len. 30]: `` That we should send all the females away to Don Teodoro 's -- it is but five miles -- and call the men together as soon as possible .
Parsing [sent. 1580 len. 14]: We are strong enough to beat them off if we barricade the house .
Parsing [sent. 1581 len. 31]: They can not land more than from ninety to one hundred men , as some must remain in charge of the schooner ; and we can muster quite as many .
Parsing [sent. 1582 len. 18]: It may be as well to promise our men a reward if they do their duty . ''
Parsing [sent. 1583 len. 15]: `` That is all right enough ; and the bullion we have here . ''
Parsing [sent. 1584 len. 38]: `` Here we had better let it remain ; it will take too much time to remove it , and , besides , will weaken our force by the men who must be in charge of it .
Parsing [sent. 1585 len. 16]: The out-houses must be abandoned , and everything which is of consequence taken from them .
Parsing [sent. 1586 len. 9]: Fire them they will , in all probability .
Parsing [sent. 1587 len. 18]: At all events we have plenty of time before us , if we begin at once . ''
Parsing [sent. 1588 len. 27]: `` Well , Francisco , I shall make you commandant , and leave the arrangements to you , while I go and speak to Donna Isidora .
Parsing [sent. 1589 len. 26]: Send for the men and speak to them ; promise them rewards , and act as if you were ordering upon your own responsibility . ''
Parsing [sent. 1590 len. 18]: `` I trust I shall prove myself worthy of your confidence , sir , '' replied Francisco .
Parsing [sent. 1591 len. 4]: `` Carambo ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1592 len. 20]: exclaimed the old don , as he left the room ; `` but it is fortunate you are here .
Parsing [sent. 1593 len. 11]: We might all have been murdered in our beds . ''
Parsing [sent. 1594 len. 32]: Francisco sent for the head men of the establishment , and told them what he was convinced they would have to expect ; and he then explained to them his views .
Parsing [sent. 1595 len. 40]: The rest were all summoned ; and Francisco pointed out to them the little mercy they would receive if the pirates were not repulsed , and the rewards which were promised by Don Cumanos if they did their duty .
Parsing [sent. 1596 len. 23]: Spaniards are individually brave ; and , encouraged by Francisco , they agreed that they would defend the property to the last .
Parsing [sent. 1597 len. 26]: The house of Don Cumanos was well suited to resist an attack of this description , in which musketry only was expected to be employed .
Parsing [sent. 1598 len. 27]: It was a long parallelogram of stone walls , with a wooden veranda on the first floor , -- for it was only one story high .
Parsing [sent. 1599 len. 33]: The windows on the first story were more numerous , but at the basement there were but two , and no other opening but the door in the whole line of building .
Parsing [sent. 1600 len. 14]: It was of a composite architecture , between the Morisco and the Spanish .
Parsing [sent. 1601 len. 32]: If the lower part of the house , which was of stone , could be secured from entrance , the assailants would , of course , fight under a great disadvantage .
Parsing [sent. 1602 len. 59]: The windows below were the first secured by piling a heavy mass of stones in the interior of the rooms against them , rising to the ceiling from a base like the segment of a pyramid , extending to the opposite side of the chamber ; and every preparation was made for effectually barricading the door before night .
Parsing [sent. 1603 len. 26]: Ladders were then fixed to ascend to the veranda , which was rendered musket-proof nearly as high as its railings , to protect the men .
Parsing [sent. 1604 len. 47]: The Donna Isidora , and the women of the establishment , were , in the afternoon , despatched to Don Teodoro 's ; and , at the request of Francisco , joined to the entreaties of Donna Isidora , Don Cumanos was persuaded to accompany them .
Parsing [sent. 1605 len. 47]: The don called his men , and telling them that he left Francisco in command , expected them to do their duty ; and then shaking hands with him , the cavalcade was soon lost in the woods behind the narrow meadows which skirted the river .
Parsing [sent. 1606 len. 9]: There was no want of muskets and ammunition .
Parsing [sent. 1607 len. 19]: Some were employed casting bullets , and others in examining the arms which had long been laid by .
Parsing [sent. 1608 len. 57]: Before evening all was ready ; every man had received his arms and ammunition ; the flints had been inspected ; and Francisco had time to pay more attention to the schooner , which had , during the day , increased her distance from the land , but was now again standing in for the shore .
Parsing [sent. 1609 len. 20]: Half-an-hour before dusk , when within three miles , she wore round and put her head to the offing .
Parsing [sent. 1610 len. 33]: `` They 'll attack this night , '' said Francisco , `` I feel almost positive : their yards and stay-tackles are up , all ready for hoisting out the long-boat . ''
Parsing [sent. 1611 len. 24]: `` Let them come , senor ; we will give them a warm reception , '' replied Diego , the second in authority .
Parsing [sent. 1612 len. 10]: It was soon too dark to perceive the vessel .
Parsing [sent. 1613 len. 39]: Francisco and Diego ordered every man , but five , into the house ; the door was firmly barricaded , and some large pieces of rock , which had been rolled into the passage , piled against it .
Parsing [sent. 1614 len. 33]: Francisco then posted the five men down the banks of the river , at a hundred yards ' distance from each other , to give notice of the approach of the boats .
Parsing [sent. 1615 len. 22]: It was about ten o'clock at night , when Francisco and Diego descended the ladder and went to examine their outposts .
Parsing [sent. 1616 len. 36]: `` Senor , '' said Diego , as he and Francisco stood on the bank of the river , `` at what hour is it your idea that these villains will make their attempt ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1617 len. 7]: `` That is difficult to say .
Parsing [sent. 1618 len. 53]: If the same captain commands them who did when I was on board of her , it will not be until after the moon is down , which will not be till midnight ; but should it be any other who is in authority , they may not be so prudent . ''
Parsing [sent. 1619 len. 4]: `` Holy Virgin !
Parsing [sent. 1620 len. 12]: senor , were you ever on board of that vessel ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1621 len. 24]: `` Yes , Diego , I was , and for a long while , too ; but not with my own good will .
Parsing [sent. 1622 len. 14]: Had I not been on board I never should have recognised her . ''
Parsing [sent. 1623 len. 21]: `` Very true , senor ; then we may thank the saints that you have once been a pirate . ''
Parsing [sent. 1624 len. 47]: `` I hope that I never was that , Diego , '' replied Francisco , smiling ; `` but I have been a witness to dreadful proceedings on board of that vessel , at the remembrance of which , even now , my blood curdles . ''
Parsing [sent. 1625 len. 48]: To pass away the time , Francisco then detailed many scenes of horror to Diego which he had witnessed when on board of the _ Avenger _ ; and he was still in the middle of a narrative when a musket was discharged by the farthermost sentinel .
Parsing [sent. 1626 len. 6]: `` Hark , Diego ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1627 len. 22]: Another , and another , nearer and nearer to them , gave the signal that the boats were close at hand .
Parsing [sent. 1628 len. 36]: In a few minutes the men all came in , announcing that the pirates were pulling up the stream in three boats , and were less than a quarter of a mile from the landing-place .
Parsing [sent. 1629 len. 22]: `` Diego , go to the house with these men , and see that all is ready , '' said Francisco .
Parsing [sent. 1630 len. 20]: `` I will wait here a little longer ; but do not fire till I come to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1631 len. 15]: Diego and the men departed , and Francisco was left on the beach alone .
Parsing [sent. 1632 len. 28]: In another minute , the sound of the oars was plainly distinguishable , and Francisco 's ears were directed to catch , if possible , the voices .
Parsing [sent. 1633 len. 29]: `` Yes , '' thought he , `` you come with the intentions of murder and robbery ; but you will , through me , be disappointed . ''
Parsing [sent. 1634 len. 12]: As the boats approached , he heard the voice of Hawkhurst .
Parsing [sent. 1635 len. 37]: The signal muskets fired had told the pirates that they were discovered , and that , in all probability , they would meet with resistance ; silence was , therefore , no longer of any advantage .
Parsing [sent. 1636 len. 6]: `` Oars , my lads !
Parsing [sent. 1637 len. 4]: -- oars ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1638 len. 3]: cried Hawkhurst .
Parsing [sent. 1639 len. 12]: One boat ceased rowing , and soon afterwards the two others .
Parsing [sent. 1640 len. 40]: The whole of them were now plainly seen by Francisco , at the distance of about one cable 's length from where he stood ; and the clear still night carried the sound of their voices along the water .
Parsing [sent. 1641 len. 19]: `` Here is a creek , sir , '' said Hawkhurst , `` leading up to those buildings .
Parsing [sent. 1642 len. 34]: Would it not be better to land there , as , if they are not occupied , they will prove a protection to us if we have a hard fight for it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1643 len. 21]: `` Very true , Hawkhurst , '' replied a voice , which Francisco immediately recognised to be that of Cain .
Parsing [sent. 1644 len. 23]: `` He is alive , then , '' thought Francisco , `` and his blood is not yet upon my hands . ''
Parsing [sent. 1645 len. 8]: `` Give way , my lads ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1646 len. 3]: cried Hawkhurst .
Parsing [sent. 1647 len. 15]: The boats dashed up the creek , and Francisco hastened back to the house .
Parsing [sent. 1648 len. 31]: `` Now , my lads , '' said he , as he sprang up the ladder , `` you must be resolute ; we have to deal with desperate men .
Parsing [sent. 1649 len. 25]: I have heard the voices of the captain and the chief mate ; so there is no doubt as to its being the pirate .
Parsing [sent. 1650 len. 13]: The boats are up the creek and will land behind the out-buildings .
Parsing [sent. 1651 len. 25]: Haul up these ladders , and lay them fore and aft on the veranda ; and do not fire without taking a good aim .
Parsing [sent. 1652 len. 2]: Silence !
Parsing [sent. 1653 len. 5]: my men -- silence !
Parsing [sent. 1654 len. 5]: Here they come . ''
Parsing [sent. 1655 len. 13]: The pirates were now seen advancing from the out-buildings in strong force .
Parsing [sent. 1656 len. 38]: In the direction in which they came , it was only from the side of the veranda , at which not more than eight or ten men could be placed , that the enemy could be repulsed .
Parsing [sent. 1657 len. 28]: Francisco therefore gave orders that as soon as some of the men had fired they should retreat and load their muskets , to make room for others .
Parsing [sent. 1658 len. 27]: When the pirates had advanced halfway to the house , on the clear space between it and the outbuildings , Francisco gave the word to fire .
Parsing [sent. 1659 len. 49]: The volley was answered by another , and a shout from the pirates , who , with Hawkhurst and Cain at their head , now pressed on , but not until they had received a second discharge from the Spaniards , and the pirates had fired in return .
Parsing [sent. 1660 len. 34]: As the Spaniards could not at first fire a volley of more than a dozen muskets at a time , their opponents imagined their force to be much less than it really was .
Parsing [sent. 1661 len. 6]: They now made other arrangements .
Parsing [sent. 1662 len. 20]: They spread themselves in a semicircle in front of the veranda , and kept up a continued galling fire .
Parsing [sent. 1663 len. 46]: This was returned by the party under Francisco for nearly a quarter of an hour ; and as all the muskets were now called into action , the pirates found out that they had a more formidable enemy to cope with than they had anticipated .
Parsing [sent. 1664 len. 24]: It was now quite dark , and not a figure was to be distinguished , except by the momentary flashing of the fire-arms .
Parsing [sent. 1665 len. 24]: Cain and Hawkhurst , leaving their men to continue the attack , had gained the house , and a position under the veranda .
Parsing [sent. 1666 len. 48]: Examining the windows and door , there appeared but little chance of forcing an entrance ; but it immediately occurred to them that under the veranda their men would not be exposed , and that they might fire through the wooden floor of it upon those above .
Parsing [sent. 1667 len. 22]: Hawkhurst hastened away , and returned with about half the men , leaving the others to continue their attack as before .
Parsing [sent. 1668 len. 9]: The advantage of this manoeuvre was soon evident .
Parsing [sent. 1669 len. 40]: The musket-balls of the pirates pierced the planks , and wounded many of the Spaniards severely ; and Francisco was at last obliged to order his men to retreat into the house , and fire out of the windows .
Parsing [sent. 1670 len. 31]: But even this warfare did not continue ; for the supporting-pillars of the veranda being of wood , and very dry , they were set fire to by the pirates .
Parsing [sent. 1671 len. 15]: Gradually the flames wound round them , and their forked tongues licked the balustrade .
Parsing [sent. 1672 len. 12]: At last , the whole of the veranda was in flames .
Parsing [sent. 1673 len. 24]: This was a great advantage to the attacking party , who could now distinguish the Spaniards without their being so clearly seen themselves .
Parsing [sent. 1674 len. 6]: Many were killed and wounded .
Parsing [sent. 1675 len. 37]: The smoke and heat became so intense in the upper story that the men could no longer remain there ; and , by the advice of Francisco , they retreated to the basement of the house .
Parsing [sent. 1676 len. 10]: `` What shall we do now , senor ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1677 len. 8]: said Diego , with a grave face .
Parsing [sent. 1678 len. 4]: `` Do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1679 len. 14]: replied Francisco ; `` they have burnt the veranda , that is all .
Parsing [sent. 1680 len. 24]: The house will not take fire ; it is of solid stone : the roof indeed may ; but still here we are .
Parsing [sent. 1681 len. 14]: I do not see that they are more advanced than they were before .
Parsing [sent. 1682 len. 23]: As soon as the veranda has burnt down , we must return above , and commence firing again from the windows . ''
Parsing [sent. 1683 len. 5]: `` Hark , sir !
Parsing [sent. 1684 len. 7]: they are trying the door . ''
Parsing [sent. 1685 len. 23]: `` They may try a long while ; they should have tried the door while the veranda protected them from our sight .
Parsing [sent. 1686 len. 18]: As soon as it is burnt , we shall be able to drive them away from it .
Parsing [sent. 1687 len. 12]: I will go up again and see how things are . ''
Parsing [sent. 1688 len. 11]: `` No , senor ; it is of no use .
Parsing [sent. 1689 len. 12]: Why expose yourself now that the flames are so bright ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1690 len. 14]: `` I must go and see if that is the case , Diego .
Parsing [sent. 1691 len. 24]: Put all the wounded men in the north chamber , it will be the safest , and more out of the way . ''
Parsing [sent. 1692 len. 12]: Francisco ascended the stone staircase , and gained the upper story .
Parsing [sent. 1693 len. 13]: The rooms were filled with smoke , and he could distinguish nothing .
Parsing [sent. 1694 len. 7]: An occasional bullet whistled past him .
Parsing [sent. 1695 len. 15]: He walked towards the windows , and sheltered himself behind the wall between them .
Parsing [sent. 1696 len. 13]: The flames were not so violent , and the heat more bearable .
Parsing [sent. 1697 len. 20]: In a short time , a crash , and then another told him that the veranda had fallen in .
Parsing [sent. 1698 len. 6]: He looked through the window .
Parsing [sent. 1699 len. 26]: The mass of lighted embers had fallen down in front of the house , and had , for a time , driven away the assailants .
Parsing [sent. 1700 len. 34]: Nothing was left of the veranda but the burning ends of the joists fixed in the wall above the windows , and the still glowing remains of the posts which once supported it .
Parsing [sent. 1701 len. 27]: But the smoke from below now cleared away , and the discharge of one or two muskets told Francisco that he was perceived by the enemy .
Parsing [sent. 1702 len. 39]: `` The roof is safe , '' thought he , as he withdrew from the window ; `` and now I do not know whether the loss of the veranda may not prove a gain to us . ''
Parsing [sent. 1703 len. 13]: What were the intentions of the pirates it was difficult to ascertain .
Parsing [sent. 1704 len. 16]: For a time they had left off firing , and Francisco returned to his comrades .
Parsing [sent. 1705 len. 52]: The smoke had gradually cleared away , and they were able to resume their position above ; but as the pirates did not fire , they , of course , could do nothing , as it was only by the flashing of the muskets that the enemy was to be distinguished .
Parsing [sent. 1706 len. 27]: No further attempts were made at the door or windows below ; and Francisco in vain puzzled himself as to the intended plans of the assailants .
Parsing [sent. 1707 len. 9]: Nearly half an hour of suspense passed away .
Parsing [sent. 1708 len. 24]: Some of the Spaniards were of opinion that they had retreated to their boats and gone away , but Francisco knew them better .
Parsing [sent. 1709 len. 18]: All he could do was to remain above , and occasionally look out to discover their motions .
Parsing [sent. 1710 len. 27]: Diego , and one or two more , remained with him ; the other men were kept below , that they might be out of danger .
Parsing [sent. 1711 len. 4]: `` Holy Francis !
Parsing [sent. 1712 len. 10]: but this has been a dreadful night , senor !
Parsing [sent. 1713 len. 7]: How many hours until daylight ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1714 len. 3]: said Diego .
Parsing [sent. 1715 len. 25]: `` Two hours at least , I should think , '' replied Francisco ; `` but the affair will be decided before that . ''
Parsing [sent. 1716 len. 6]: `` The saints protect us !
Parsing [sent. 1717 len. 10]: See , senor , are they not coming ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1718 len. 21]: Francisco looked through the gloom , in the direction of the outbuildings , and perceived a group of men advancing .
Parsing [sent. 1719 len. 11]: A few moments and he could clearly make them out .
Parsing [sent. 1720 len. 18]: `` Yes , truly , Diego ; and they have made ladders , which they are carrying .
Parsing [sent. 1721 len. 7]: They intend to storm the windows .
Parsing [sent. 1722 len. 13]: Call them up ; and now we must fight hard indeed . ''
Parsing [sent. 1723 len. 32]: The Spaniards hastened up and filled the room above , which had three windows in the front , looking towards the river , and which had been sheltered by the veranda .
Parsing [sent. 1724 len. 9]: `` Shall we fire now , senor ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1725 len. 16]: `` No -- no : do not fire till your muzzles are at their hearts .
Parsing [sent. 1726 len. 14]: They can not mount more than two at a time at each window .
Parsing [sent. 1727 len. 30]: Recollect , my lads , that you must now fight hard , for your lives will not be spared ; they will show no quarter and no mercy . ''
Parsing [sent. 1728 len. 17]: The ends of the rude ladders now made their appearance above the sill of each window .
Parsing [sent. 1729 len. 19]: They had been hastily , yet firmly , constructed ; and were nearly as wide as the windows .
Parsing [sent. 1730 len. 13]: A loud cheer was followed by a simultaneous mounting of the ladders .
Parsing [sent. 1731 len. 17]: Francisco was at the centre window , when Hawkhurst made his appearance , sabre in hand .
Parsing [sent. 1732 len. 22]: He struck aside the musket aimed at him , and the ball whizzed harmless over the broad water of the river .
Parsing [sent. 1733 len. 31]: Another step , and he would have been in , when Francisco fired his pistol ; the ball entered the left shoulder of Hawkhurst , and he dropped his hold .
Parsing [sent. 1734 len. 20]: Before he could regain it , a Spaniard charged at him with a musket , and threw him back .
Parsing [sent. 1735 len. 23]: He fell , bearing down with him one or two of his comrades , who had been following him up the ladder .
Parsing [sent. 1736 len. 47]: Francisco felt as if the attack at that window was of little consequence after the fall of Hawkhurst , whose voice he had recognised ; and he hastened to the one on the left , as he had heard Cain encouraging his men in that direction .
Parsing [sent. 1737 len. 30]: He was not wrong in his conjecture ; Cain was at the window , attempting to force an entrance , but was opposed by Diego and other resolute men .
Parsing [sent. 1738 len. 20]: But the belt of the pirate-captain was full of pistols , and he had already fired three with effect .
Parsing [sent. 1739 len. 22]: Diego and the two best men were wounded , and the others who opposed him were alarmed at his giant proportions .
Parsing [sent. 1740 len. 23]: Francisco rushed to attack him ; but what was the force of so young a man against the Herculean power of Cain !
Parsing [sent. 1741 len. 58]: Still Francisco 's left hand was at the throat of the pirate , and the pistol was pointed in his right , when a flash of another pistol , fired by one who followed Cain , threw its momentary vivid light upon the features of Francisco , as he cried out , `` Blood for blood ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1742 len. 36]: It was enough ; the pirate captain uttered a yell of terror at the supposed supernatural appearance ; and he fell from the ladder in a fit among the still burning embers of the veranda .
Parsing [sent. 1743 len. 22]: The fall of their two chiefs , and the determined resistance of the Spaniards , checked the impetuosity of the assailants .
Parsing [sent. 1744 len. 16]: They hesitated ; and they at last retreated , bearing away with them their wounded .
Parsing [sent. 1745 len. 26]: The Spaniards cheered , and , led by Francisco , followed them down the ladders , and , in their turn , became the assailants .
Parsing [sent. 1746 len. 18]: Still the pirates ' retreat was orderly : they fired , and retired rank behind rank successively .
Parsing [sent. 1747 len. 27]: They kept the Spaniards at bay , until they had arrived at the boats ; when a charge was made , and a severe conflict ensued .
Parsing [sent. 1748 len. 18]: But the pirates had lost too many men , and , without their commander , felt dispirited .
Parsing [sent. 1749 len. 15]: Hawkhurst was still on his legs and giving his orders as coolly as ever .
Parsing [sent. 1750 len. 32]: He espied Francisco , and rushing at him , while the two parties were opposed muzzle to muzzle , seized him by his collar and dragged him in amongst the pirates .
Parsing [sent. 1751 len. 8]: `` Secure him at all events ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1752 len. 12]: cried Hawkhurst , as they slowly retreated and gained the out-houses .
Parsing [sent. 1753 len. 51]: Francisco was overpowered and hauled into one of the boats , all of which in a few minutes afterwards were pulling with all their might to escape from the muskets of the Spaniards , who followed the pirates by the banks of the river , annoying them in their retreat .
Parsing [sent. 1754 len. 3]: CHAPTER FOURTEEN .
Parsing [sent. 1755 len. 3]: THE MEETING .
Parsing [sent. 1756 len. 8]: The pirates returned to their vessel discomfited .
Parsing [sent. 1757 len. 35]: Those on board , who were prepared to hoist in ingots of precious metal , had to receive nought but wounded men , and many of their comrades had remained dead on the shore .
Parsing [sent. 1758 len. 7]: Their captain was melancholy and downcast .
Parsing [sent. 1759 len. 19]: Hawkhurst was badly wounded , and obliged to be carried below as soon as he came on board .
Parsing [sent. 1760 len. 37]: The only capture which they had made was their former associate Francisco , who , by the last words spoken by Hawkhurst as he was supported to his cabin was ordered to be put in irons .
Parsing [sent. 1761 len. 14]: The boats were hoisted in without noise , and a general gloom prevailed .
Parsing [sent. 1762 len. 25]: All sail was then made upon the schooner , and when day dawned she was seen by the Spaniards far away to the northward .
Parsing [sent. 1763 len. 57]: The report was soon spread through the schooner that Francisco had been the cause of their defeat ; and this was only a surmise , still , as they considered that had he not recognised the vessel the Spaniards would not have been prepared , they had good grounds for what had swelled into an assertion .
Parsing [sent. 1764 len. 37]: He became , therefore , to many of them , an object of bitter enmity , and they looked forward with pleasure to his destruction , which his present confinement they considered but the precursor of .
Parsing [sent. 1765 len. 3]: `` Hist !
Parsing [sent. 1766 len. 4]: Massa Francisco ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1767 len. 13]: said a low voice near to where Francisco sat on the chest .
Parsing [sent. 1768 len. 12]: Francisco turned round and beheld the Krouman , his old friend .
Parsing [sent. 1769 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 1770 len. 10]: Pompey , are you all still on board ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1771 len. 3]: said Francisco .
Parsing [sent. 1772 len. 3]: `` All !
Parsing [sent. 1773 len. 24]: no , '' replied the man , shaking his head ; `` some die -- some get away -- only four Kroumen left .
Parsing [sent. 1774 len. 9]: Massa Francisco , how you come back again ?
Parsing [sent. 1775 len. 5]: Everybody tink you dead .
Parsing [sent. 1776 len. 16]: I say no , not dead -- ab charm with him -- ab book . ''
Parsing [sent. 1777 len. 58]: `` If that was my charm , I have it still , '' replied Francisco , taking the Bible out of his vest ; for , strange to say , Francisco himself had a kind of superstition relative to that Bible , and had put it into his bosom previous to the attack made by the pirates .
Parsing [sent. 1778 len. 13]: `` Dat very good , Massa Francisco ; den you quite safe .
Parsing [sent. 1779 len. 9]: Here come Johnson -- he very bad man .
Parsing [sent. 1780 len. 5]: I go away . ''
Parsing [sent. 1781 len. 16]: In the meantime Cain had retired to his cabin with feelings scarcely to be analysed .
Parsing [sent. 1782 len. 6]: He was in a bewilderment .
Parsing [sent. 1783 len. 35]: Notwithstanding the wound he had received by the hand of Francisco , he would never have sanctioned Hawkhurst putting him on shore on a spot which promised nothing but a lingering and miserable death .
Parsing [sent. 1784 len. 71]: Irritated as he had been by the young man 's open defiance , he loved him -- loved him much more than he was aware of himself ; and when he had recovered sufficiently from his wound , and had been informed where Francisco had been sent on shore , he quarrelled with Hawkhurst , and reproached him bitterly and sternly , in language which Hawkhurst never forgot or forgave .
Parsing [sent. 1785 len. 14]: The vision of the starving lad haunted Cain , and rendered him miserable .
Parsing [sent. 1786 len. 35]: His affection for him , now that he was , as he supposed , lost for ever , increased with tenfold force ; and since that period Cain had never been seen to smile .
Parsing [sent. 1787 len. 20]: He became more gloomy , more ferocious than ever , and the men trembled when he appeared on deck .
Parsing [sent. 1788 len. 31]: The apparition of Francisco after so long an interval , and in such an unexpected quarter of the globe , acted , as we have before described , upon Cain .
Parsing [sent. 1789 len. 38]: When he was taken to the boat he was still confused in his ideas , and it was not until they were nearly on board that he perceived that this young man was indeed at his side .
Parsing [sent. 1790 len. 29]: He could have fallen on his neck and kissed him : for Francisco had become to him a capture more prized than all the wealth of the Indies .
Parsing [sent. 1791 len. 53]: But one pure , good feeling was unextinguished in the bosom of Cain ; stained with every crime -- with his hands so deeply imbrued in blood -- at enmity with all the rest of the world , that one feeling burnt bright and clear , and was not to be quenched .
Parsing [sent. 1792 len. 17]: It might have proved a beacon-light to steer him back to repentance and to good works .
Parsing [sent. 1793 len. 15]: But there were other feelings which also crowded upon the mind of the pirate-captain .
Parsing [sent. 1794 len. 8]: He knew Francisco 's firmness and decision .
Parsing [sent. 1795 len. 28]: By some inscrutable means , which Cain considered as supernatural , Francisco had obtained the knowledge , and had accused him , of his mother 's death .
Parsing [sent. 1796 len. 18]: Would not the affection which he felt for the young man be met with hatred and defiance ?
Parsing [sent. 1797 len. 9]: He was but too sure that it would .
Parsing [sent. 1798 len. 23]: And then his gloomy , cruel disposition would reassume its influence , and he thought of revenging the attack upon his life .
Parsing [sent. 1799 len. 30]: His astonishment at the reappearance of Francisco was equally great , and he trembled at the sight of him , as if he were his accusing and condemning spirit .
Parsing [sent. 1800 len. 23]: Thus did he wander from one fearful fancy to another , until he at last summoned up resolution to send for him .
Parsing [sent. 1801 len. 26]: A morose , dark man , whom Francisco had not seen when he was before in the schooner , obeyed the commands of the captain .
Parsing [sent. 1802 len. 14]: The irons were unlocked , and Francisco was brought down into the cabin .
Parsing [sent. 1803 len. 8]: The captain rose and shut the door .
Parsing [sent. 1804 len. 15]: `` I little thought to see you here , Francisco , '' said Cain .
Parsing [sent. 1805 len. 29]: `` Probably not , '' replied Francisco , boldly , `` but you have me again , in your power , and may now wreak your vengeance . ''
Parsing [sent. 1806 len. 29]: `` I feel none , Francisco ; nor would I have suffered you to have been put on shore as you were , had I known of it .
Parsing [sent. 1807 len. 33]: Even now that our expedition has failed through your means , I feel no anger towards you , although I shall have some difficulty in preserving you from the enmity of others .
Parsing [sent. 1808 len. 29]: Indeed , Francisco , I am glad to find that you are alive , and I have bitterly mourned your loss : '' and Cain extended his hand .
Parsing [sent. 1809 len. 10]: But Francisco folded his arms , and was silent .
Parsing [sent. 1810 len. 8]: `` Are you then so unforgiving ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1811 len. 4]: said the captain .
Parsing [sent. 1812 len. 10]: `` You know that I tell the truth . ''
Parsing [sent. 1813 len. 54]: `` I believe that you state the truth , Captain Cain , for you are too bold to lie ; and , as far as I am concerned , you have all the forgiveness you may wish ; but I can not take that hand ; nor are our accounts yet settled . ''
Parsing [sent. 1814 len. 6]: `` What would you more ?
Parsing [sent. 1815 len. 7]: Can not we be friends again ?
Parsing [sent. 1816 len. 10]: I do not ask you to remain on board .
Parsing [sent. 1817 len. 9]: You are free to go where you please .
Parsing [sent. 1818 len. 17]: Come , Francisco , take my hand , and let us forget what is past . ''
Parsing [sent. 1819 len. 15]: `` The hand that is imbrued with my mother 's blood , perhaps ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1820 len. 3]: exclaimed Francisco .
Parsing [sent. 1821 len. 4]: `` Never ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1822 len. 8]: `` Not so , by God ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1823 len. 3]: exclaimed Cain .
Parsing [sent. 1824 len. 12]: `` No , no ; not quite so bad as that .
Parsing [sent. 1825 len. 12]: In my mood I struck your mother ; I grant it .
Parsing [sent. 1826 len. 16]: I did not intend to injure her , but I did , and she died .
Parsing [sent. 1827 len. 10]: I will not lie -- that is the fact .
Parsing [sent. 1828 len. 23]: And it is also the fact that I wept over her , Francisco ; for I loved her as I do you .
Parsing [sent. 1829 len. 34]: `` It was a hasty , bitter blow , that , '' continued Cain , soliloquising , with his hand to his forehead , and unconscious of Francisco 's presence at the moment .
Parsing [sent. 1830 len. 15]: `` It made me what I am , for it made me reckless . ''
Parsing [sent. 1831 len. 26]: `` Francisco , '' said Cain , raising his head , `` I was bad , but I was no pirate when your mother lived .
Parsing [sent. 1832 len. 17]: There is a curse upon me : that which I love most I treat the worst .
Parsing [sent. 1833 len. 28]: Of all the world , I loved your mother most : yet did she from me receive much injury , and at last I caused her death .
Parsing [sent. 1834 len. 58]: Next to your mother , whose memory I at once revere and love , and tremble when I think of -LRB- and each night does she appear to me -RRB- , I have loved you , Francisco ; for you , like her , have an angel 's feelings : yet have I treated you as ill .
Parsing [sent. 1835 len. 9]: You thwarted me , and you were right .
Parsing [sent. 1836 len. 20]: Had you been wrong , I had not cared ; but you were right , and it maddened me .
Parsing [sent. 1837 len. 29]: Your appeals by day -- your mother 's in my dreams -- '' Francisco 's heart was softened ; if not repentance , there was at least contrition .
Parsing [sent. 1838 len. 10]: `` Indeed I pity you , '' replied Francisco .
Parsing [sent. 1839 len. 24]: `` You must do more , Francisco ; you must be friends with me , '' said Cain , again extending his hand .
Parsing [sent. 1840 len. 20]: `` I can not take that hand , it is too deeply dyed in blood , '' replied Francisco .
Parsing [sent. 1841 len. 12]: `` Well , well , so would have said your mother .
Parsing [sent. 1842 len. 55]: But hear me , Francisco , '' said Cain , lowering his voice to a whisper , lest he should be overheard ; `` I am tired of this life -- perhaps sorry for what I have done -- I wish to leave it -- have wealth in plenty concealed where others know not .
Parsing [sent. 1843 len. 21]: Tell me , Francisco , shall we both quit this vessel , and live together happily and without doing wrong ?
Parsing [sent. 1844 len. 7]: You shall share all , Francisco .
Parsing [sent. 1845 len. 10]: Say , now , does that please you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1846 len. 35]: `` Yes ; it pleases me to hear that you will abandon your lawless life , Captain Cain ; but share your wealth I can not , for how has it been gained ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1847 len. 16]: `` It can not be returned , Francisco ; I will do good with it .
Parsing [sent. 1848 len. 6]: I will indeed , Francisco .
Parsing [sent. 1849 len. 14]: I -- will -- repent ; '' and again the hand was extended .
Parsing [sent. 1850 len. 3]: Francisco hesitated .
Parsing [sent. 1851 len. 9]: `` I do , so help me God !
Parsing [sent. 1852 len. 9]: I _ do _ repent , Francisco ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1853 len. 4]: exclaimed the pirate-captain .
Parsing [sent. 1854 len. 23]: `` And I , as a Christian , do forgive you all , '' replied Francisco , taking the still extended hand .
Parsing [sent. 1855 len. 9]: `` May God forgive you , too ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1856 len. 4]: `` Amen ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1857 len. 14]: replied the pirate , solemnly , covering his face up in his hands .
Parsing [sent. 1858 len. 14]: In this position he remained some minutes , Francisco watching him in silence .
Parsing [sent. 1859 len. 30]: At last the face was uncovered , and , to the surprise of Francisco , a tear was on the cheek of Cain and his eyes suffused with moisture .
Parsing [sent. 1860 len. 29]: Francisco no longer waited for the hand to be extended ; he walked up to the captain , and taking him by the hand , pressed it warmly .
Parsing [sent. 1861 len. 7]: `` God bless you , boy !
Parsing [sent. 1862 len. 5]: God bless you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1863 len. 10]: said Cain ; `` but leave me now . ''
Parsing [sent. 1864 len. 11]: Francisco returned on deck with a light and grateful heart .
Parsing [sent. 1865 len. 31]: His countenance at once told those who were near him that he was not condemned , and many who dared not before take notice of him , now saluted him .
Parsing [sent. 1866 len. 27]: The man who had taken him out of irons looked round ; he was a creature of Hawkhurst , and he knew not how to act .
Parsing [sent. 1867 len. 17]: Francisco observed him , and , with a wave of the hand , ordered him below .
Parsing [sent. 1868 len. 36]: That Francisco was again in authority was instantly perceived , and the first proof of it was , that the new second mate reported to him that there was a sail on the weather bow .
Parsing [sent. 1869 len. 8]: Francisco took the glass to examine her .
Parsing [sent. 1870 len. 9]: It was a large schooner under all sail .
Parsing [sent. 1871 len. 30]: Not wishing that any one should enter the cabin but himself , he went down to the cabin-door , and knocked before he entered , and reported the vessel .
Parsing [sent. 1872 len. 33]: `` Thank you , Francisco ; you must take Hawkhurst 's duty for the present -- it shall not be for long ; and fear not that I shall make another capture .
Parsing [sent. 1873 len. 10]: I swear to you I will not , Francisco .
Parsing [sent. 1874 len. 42]: But this schooner -- I know very well what she is : she has been looking after us some time : and a week ago , Francisco , I was anxious to meet her , that I might shed more blood .
Parsing [sent. 1875 len. 14]: Now I will do all I can to avoid her , and escape .
Parsing [sent. 1876 len. 8]: I can do no more , Francisco .
Parsing [sent. 1877 len. 7]: I must not be taken . ''
Parsing [sent. 1878 len. 8]: `` There I can not blame you .
Parsing [sent. 1879 len. 19]: To avoid her will be easy , I should think ; the _ Avenger _ outsails everything . ''
Parsing [sent. 1880 len. 16]: `` Except , I believe , the _ Enterprise _ , which is a sister-vessel .
Parsing [sent. 1881 len. 3]: By heaven !
Parsing [sent. 1882 len. 51]: it 's a fair match , '' continued Cain , his feelings of combativeness returning for a moment ; `` and it will look like a craven to refuse the fight : but fear not , Francisco -- I have promised you , and I shall keep my word . ''
Parsing [sent. 1883 len. 13]: Cain went on deck , and surveyed the vessel through the glass .
Parsing [sent. 1884 len. 40]: `` Yes , it must be her , '' said he aloud , so as to be heard by the pirates ; `` she has been sent out by the admiral on purpose , full of his best men .
Parsing [sent. 1885 len. 8]: What a pity we are short-handed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1886 len. 14]: `` There 's enough of us , sir , '' observed the boatswain .
Parsing [sent. 1887 len. 32]: `` Yes , '' replied Cain , `` if there was anything but hard blows to be got ; but that is all , and I can not spare more men .
Parsing [sent. 1888 len. 4]: Ready about ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1889 len. 6]: continued he , walking aft .
Parsing [sent. 1890 len. 33]: The _ Enterprise _ , for she was the vessel in pursuit , was then about five miles distant , steering for the _ Avenger _ , who was on a wind .
Parsing [sent. 1891 len. 24]: As soon as the _ Avenger _ tacked , the _ Enterprise _ took in her topmast studding-sail , and hauled her wind .
Parsing [sent. 1892 len. 22]: This brought the _ Enterprise _ well on the weather-quarter of the _ Avenger _ , who now made all sail .
Parsing [sent. 1893 len. 46]: The pirates , who had had quite enough of fighting , and were not stimulated by the presence of Hawkhurst , or the wishes of their captain , now showed as much anxiety to avoid , as they usually did to seek , a combat .
Parsing [sent. 1894 len. 56]: At the first trial of sailing between the two schooners there was no perceptible difference ; for half an hour they both continued on a wind , and when Edward Templemore examined his sextant a second time , he could not perceive that he had gained upon the _ Avenger _ one cable 's length .
Parsing [sent. 1895 len. 18]: `` We will keep away half a point , '' said Edward to his second in command .
Parsing [sent. 1896 len. 13]: `` We can afford that , and still hold the weather-gage . ''
Parsing [sent. 1897 len. 27]: The _ Enterprise _ was kept away , and increased her speed : they neared the _ Avenger _ more than a quarter of a mile .
Parsing [sent. 1898 len. 19]: `` They are nearing us , '' observed Francisco ; `` we must keep away a point . ''
Parsing [sent. 1899 len. 27]: Away went the _ Avenger _ , and would have recovered her distance , but the _ Enterprise _ was again steered more off the wind .
Parsing [sent. 1900 len. 47]: Thus did they continue altering their course until the studding-sails below and aloft were set by both , and the position of the schooners was changed ; the _ Enterprise _ now being on the starboard instead of the larboard quarter of the _ Avenger _ .
Parsing [sent. 1901 len. 61]: The relative distance between the two schooners was , however , nearly the same , that is , about three miles and a half from each other ; and there was every prospect of a long and weary chase on the part of the _ Enterprise _ , who again kept away a point to near the _ Avenger _ .
Parsing [sent. 1902 len. 9]: Both vessels were now running to the eastward .
Parsing [sent. 1903 len. 31]: It was about an hour before dark that another sail hove in sight right a-head of the _ Avenger _ , and was clearly made out to be a frigate .
Parsing [sent. 1904 len. 42]: The pirates were alarmed at this unfortunate circumstance , as there was little doubt but that she would prove a British cruiser ; and , if not , they had equally reason to expect that she would assist in their capture .
Parsing [sent. 1905 len. 28]: She had evidently perceived the two schooners , and had made all sail , tacking every quarter of an hour so as to keep her relative position .
Parsing [sent. 1906 len. 34]: The _ Enterprise _ , who had also made out the frigate , to attract her attention , although not within range of the _ Avenger _ , commenced firing with her long-gun .
Parsing [sent. 1907 len. 10]: `` This is rather awkward , '' observed Cain .
Parsing [sent. 1908 len. 24]: `` It will be dark in less than an hour , '' observed Francisco ; `` and that is our only chance . ''
Parsing [sent. 1909 len. 5]: Cain reflected a minute .
Parsing [sent. 1910 len. 9]: `` Get the long-gun ready , my lads !
Parsing [sent. 1911 len. 31]: We will return her fire , Francisco , and hoist American colours ; that will puzzle the frigate at all events , and the night may do the rest . ''
Parsing [sent. 1912 len. 10]: The long-gun of the _ Avenger _ was ready .
Parsing [sent. 1913 len. 30]: `` I would not fire the long-gun , '' observed Francisco , `` it will show our force , and will give no reason for our attempt to escape .
Parsing [sent. 1914 len. 40]: Now , if we were to fire our broadside-guns , the difference of report between them and the one of large calibre fired by the other schooner would induce them to think that we are an American vessel . ''
Parsing [sent. 1915 len. 28]: `` Very true , '' replied Cain , `` and , as America is at peace with all the world , that our antagonist is a pirate .
Parsing [sent. 1916 len. 13]: Hold fast the long-gun , there ; and unship the starboard ports .
Parsing [sent. 1917 len. 9]: See that the ensign blows out clear . ''
Parsing [sent. 1918 len. 58]: The _ Avenger _ commenced firing an occasional gun from her broadside , the reports of which were hardly to be heard by those on board of the frigate ; while the long-gun of the _ Enterprise _ reverberated along the water , and its loud resonance was swept by the wind to the frigate to leeward .
Parsing [sent. 1919 len. 35]: Such was the state of affairs when the sun sank down in the wave , and darkness obscured the vessels from each other 's sight , except with the assistance of the night telescopes .
Parsing [sent. 1920 len. 12]: `` What do you propose to do , Captain Cain ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1921 len. 3]: said Francisco .
Parsing [sent. 1922 len. 13]: `` I have made up my mind to do a bold thing .
Parsing [sent. 1923 len. 28]: I will run down to the frigate , as if for shelter ; tell him that the other vessel is a pirate , and claim his protection .
Parsing [sent. 1924 len. 17]: Leave me to escape afterwards ; the moon will not rise till nearly one o'clock . ''
Parsing [sent. 1925 len. 27]: `` That will be a bold _ ruse _ , indeed ; but suppose you are once under her broadside , and she suspects you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1926 len. 9]: `` Then I will show her my heels .
Parsing [sent. 1927 len. 17]: I should care nothing for her and her broadside if the schooner was not here . ''
Parsing [sent. 1928 len. 21]: In an hour after dark the _ Avenger _ was close to the frigate , having steered directly for her .
Parsing [sent. 1929 len. 32]: She shortened sail gradually , as if she had few hands on board ; and , keeping his men out of sight , Cain ran under the stern of the frigate .
Parsing [sent. 1930 len. 4]: `` Schooner ahoy !
Parsing [sent. 1931 len. 7]: What schooner is that ? '' ''
Parsing [sent. 1932 len. 35]: _ Eliza of Baltimore _ , from Carthagena , '' replied Cain , rounding to under the lee of the man-of-war , and then continuing : `` That vessel in chase is a pirate .
Parsing [sent. 1933 len. 9]: Shall I send a boat on board ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1934 len. 9]: `` No ; keep company with us . ''
Parsing [sent. 1935 len. 11]: `` Ay , ay , sir , '' replied Cain .
Parsing [sent. 1936 len. 6]: `` Hands about ship ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1937 len. 24]: now resounded with the boatswain 's whistle on board of the frigate , and in a minute they were on the other tack .
Parsing [sent. 1938 len. 15]: The _ Avenger _ also tacked and kept close under the frigate 's counter .
Parsing [sent. 1939 len. 40]: In the meantime , Edward Templemore and those on board of the _ Enterprise _ who , by the course steered , had gradually neared them , perceiving the motions of the two other vessels , were quite puzzled .
Parsing [sent. 1940 len. 35]: At one time they thought they had made a mistake , and that it was not the pirate vessel ; at another they surmised that the crew had mutinied and surrendered to the frigate .
Parsing [sent. 1941 len. 19]: Edward hauled his wind , and steered directly for them , to ascertain what the real facts were .
Parsing [sent. 1942 len. 26]: The captain of the frigate , who had never lost sight of either vessel , was equally astonished at the boldness of the supposed pirate .
Parsing [sent. 1943 len. 12]: `` Surely the rascal does not intend to board us ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1944 len. 6]: said he to the first-lieutenant .
Parsing [sent. 1945 len. 36]: `` There is no saying , sir ; you know what a character he has : and some say there are three hundred men on board , which is equal to our ship 's company .
Parsing [sent. 1946 len. 30]: Or perhaps , sir , he will pass to windward of us , and give us a broadside , and be off in the wind 's eye again . ''
Parsing [sent. 1947 len. 18]: `` At all events we will have a broadside ready for him , '' replied the captain .
Parsing [sent. 1948 len. 13]: `` Clear away the starboard guns , and take out the tompions .
Parsing [sent. 1949 len. 7]: Pipe starboard watch to quarters . ''
Parsing [sent. 1950 len. 25]: The _ Enterprise _ closed with the frigate to windward , intending to run round her stern and bring to on the same tack .
Parsing [sent. 1951 len. 31]: `` He does not shorten sail yet , sir , '' said the first-lieutenant , as the schooner appeared skimming along about a cable 's length on their weather bow .
Parsing [sent. 1952 len. 22]: `` And she is full of men , sir , '' said the master , looking at her through the night-glass .
Parsing [sent. 1953 len. 8]: `` Fire a gun at her ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1954 len. 4]: said the captain .
Parsing [sent. 1955 len. 2]: Bang !
Parsing [sent. 1956 len. 25]: The smoke cleared away , and the schooner 's foretopsail , which she was in the act of clewing up , lay over side .
Parsing [sent. 1957 len. 21]: The shot had struck the foremast of the _ Enterprise _ , and cut it in two below the catharpings .
Parsing [sent. 1958 len. 13]: The _ Enterprise _ was , for the time , completely disabled .
Parsing [sent. 1959 len. 4]: `` Schooner ahoy !
Parsing [sent. 1960 len. 6]: What schooner is that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1961 len. 10]: `` His Majesty 's schooner _ Enterprise _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 1962 len. 9]: `` Send a boat on board immediately . ''
Parsing [sent. 1963 len. 8]: `` Ay , ay , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 1964 len. 6]: `` Turn the hands up ?
Parsing [sent. 1965 len. 4]: Shorten sail ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1966 len. 19]: The top-gallant and courses of the frigate were taken in , and the mainsail hove to the mast .
Parsing [sent. 1967 len. 11]: `` Signalman , whereabouts is that other schooner now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1968 len. 6]: `` The schooner , sir ?
Parsing [sent. 1969 len. 38]: On the quarter , '' replied the signalman , who with everybody else on board , was so anxious about the _ Enterprise _ , that they had neglected to watch the motions of the supposed American .
Parsing [sent. 1970 len. 20]: The man had replied at random , and he now jumped upon the signal-chests abaft to look for her .
Parsing [sent. 1971 len. 8]: But she was not to be seen .
Parsing [sent. 1972 len. 50]: Cain , who had watched all that passed between the other two vessels , and had been prepared to slip off at a moment 's warning , as soon as the gun was fired at the other schooner , had wore round and made all sail on a wind .
Parsing [sent. 1973 len. 18]: The night-glass discovered her half a mile astern ; and the _ ruse _ was immediately perceived .
Parsing [sent. 1974 len. 31]: The frigate filled and made sail , leaving Edward to return on board -- for there was no time to stop for the boat -- tacked , and gave chase .
Parsing [sent. 1975 len. 26]: But the _ Avenger _ was soon in the wind 's - eye of her ; and at daylight was no longer to be seen .
Parsing [sent. 1976 len. 35]: In the meantime , Edward Templemore had followed the frigate as soon as he could set sail on his vessel , indignant at his treatment , and vowing that he would demand a court-martial .
Parsing [sent. 1977 len. 13]: About noon the frigate rejoined him , when matters were fully explained .
Parsing [sent. 1978 len. 28]: Annoyed as they all felt at not having captured the pirate , it was unanimously agreed , that by his audacity and coolness he deserved to escape .
Parsing [sent. 1979 len. 27]: It was found that the mast of the _ Enterprise _ could be fished and scarfed , so as to enable her to continue her cruise .
Parsing [sent. 1980 len. 33]: The carpenters of the frigate were sent on board ; and in two days the injury was repaired , and Edward Templemore once more went in pursuit of the _ Avenger _ .
Parsing [sent. 1981 len. 3]: CHAPTER FIFTEEN .
Parsing [sent. 1982 len. 3]: THE MISTAKE .
Parsing [sent. 1983 len. 14]: The _ Avenger _ stood under a press of sail to the northward .
Parsing [sent. 1984 len. 43]: She had left her pursuers far behind ; and there was not a speck on the horizon , when , on the second morning , Francisco , who had resumed his berth in the captain 's cabin , went up on deck .
Parsing [sent. 1985 len. 30]: Notwithstanding the request of Cain , Francisco refused to take any part in the command of the schooner , considering himself as a passenger , or prisoner on parole .
Parsing [sent. 1986 len. 29]: He had not been on deck but a few minutes , when he observed the two Spanish fishermen belonging to the establishment of Don Cumanos conversing together forward .
Parsing [sent. 1987 len. 17]: Their capture had quite escaped his memory , and he went forward to speak to them .
Parsing [sent. 1988 len. 17]: Their surprise at seeing him was great , until Francisco informed them of what had passed .
Parsing [sent. 1989 len. 27]: They then recounted what had occurred to them , and showed their thumbs , which had been put into screws to torture from them the truth .
Parsing [sent. 1990 len. 23]: Francisco shuddered , but consoled them by promising that they should soon be at liberty , and return to their former master .
Parsing [sent. 1991 len. 13]: As Francisco returned from forward , he found Hawkhurst on the deck .
Parsing [sent. 1992 len. 8]: Their eyes met and flashed in enmity .
Parsing [sent. 1993 len. 37]: Hawkhurst was pale from loss of blood , and evidently suffering ; but he had been informed of the apparent reconciliation between Francisco and the captain , and he could no longer remain in his bed .
Parsing [sent. 1994 len. 35]: He knew , also , how the captain had avoided the combat with the _ Enterprise _ ; and something told him that there was a revolution of feeling in more than one point .
Parsing [sent. 1995 len. 20]: Suffering as he was , he resolved to be a spectator of what passed , and to watch narrowly .
Parsing [sent. 1996 len. 23]: For both Francisco and Cain he had imbibed a deadly hatred , and was watching for an opportunity to wreak his revenge .
Parsing [sent. 1997 len. 21]: At present they were too powerful ; but he felt that the time was coming when he might be triumphant .
Parsing [sent. 1998 len. 6]: Francisco passed Hawkhurst without speaking .
Parsing [sent. 1999 len. 17]: `` You are at liberty again , I see , '' observed Hawkhurst with a sneer .
Parsing [sent. 2000 len. 29]: `` I am not , at all events , indebted to you for it , '' replied Francisco , haughtily ; `` nor for my life either . ''
Parsing [sent. 2001 len. 26]: `` No , indeed ; but I believe that I am indebted to you for this bullet in my shoulder , '' replied the mate .
Parsing [sent. 2002 len. 10]: `` You are , '' replied Francisco , coolly .
Parsing [sent. 2003 len. 14]: `` And depend upon it the debt shall be repaid with usury . ''
Parsing [sent. 2004 len. 23]: `` I have no doubt of it , if ever it is in your power ; but I fear you not . ''
Parsing [sent. 2005 len. 13]: As Francisco made this reply , the captain came up the ladder .
Parsing [sent. 2006 len. 7]: Hawkhurst turned away and walked forward .
Parsing [sent. 2007 len. 32]: `` There is mischief in that man , Francisco , '' said the captain in an under-tone ; `` I hardly know whom to trust ; but he must be watched .
Parsing [sent. 2008 len. 33]: He is tampering with the men , and has been for some time ; not that it is of much consequence , if he does but remain quiet for a little while .
Parsing [sent. 2009 len. 33]: The command of this vessel he is welcome to very soon ; but if he attempts too early -- '' `` I have those I can trust to , '' replied Francisco .
Parsing [sent. 2010 len. 7]: `` Let us go below . ''
Parsing [sent. 2011 len. 19]: Francisco sent for Pompey the Krouman , and gave him his directions in the presence of the captain .
Parsing [sent. 2012 len. 30]: That night , to the surprise of all , Hawkhurst kept his watch ; and notwithstanding the fatigue , appeared every day to be rapidly recovering from his wound .
Parsing [sent. 2013 len. 17]: Nothing occurred for several days , during which the _ Avenger _ still continued her course .
Parsing [sent. 2014 len. 17]: What the captain 's intentions were did not transpire ; they were known only to Francisco .
Parsing [sent. 2015 len. 31]: `` We are very short of water , sir , '' reported Hawkhurst one morning : `` shall we have enough to last us to where we are going ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2016 len. 13]: `` How many days of full allowance have we on board ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2017 len. 9]: `` Not above twelve at the most . ''
Parsing [sent. 2018 len. 13]: `` Then we must go on half allowance , '' replied Cain .
Parsing [sent. 2019 len. 16]: `` The ship 's company wish to know where we are going , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 2020 len. 11]: `` Have they deputed you to ask the question ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2021 len. 22]: `` Not exactly , sir ; but I wish to know myself , '' replied Hawkhurst , with an insolent air .
Parsing [sent. 2022 len. 36]: `` Turn the hands up , '' replied Cain : `` as one of the ship 's company under my orders , you will , with the others , receive the information you require . ''
Parsing [sent. 2023 len. 8]: The crew of the pirate collected aft .
Parsing [sent. 2024 len. 28]: `` My lads , '' said Cain , `` I understand , from the first mate , that you are anxious to know where you are going ?
Parsing [sent. 2025 len. 47]: In reply , I acquaint you , that having so many wounded men on board , and so much plunder in the hold , I intend to repair to our rendezvous when we were formerly in this part of the world -- the _ Caicos _ .
Parsing [sent. 2026 len. 14]: Is there any other question you may wish to ask of me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2027 len. 23]: `` Yes , '' replied Hawkhurst ; `` we wish to know what your intentions are relative to that young man Francisco .
Parsing [sent. 2028 len. 43]: We have lost immense wealth ; we have now thirty men wounded in the hammocks , and nine we left dead on the shore ; and I have a bullet through my body , all of which has been occasioned by him .
Parsing [sent. 2029 len. 5]: We demand justice ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2030 len. 24]: Here Hawkhurst was supported by several of the pirates ; and there were many voices which repeated the cry of `` Justice ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2031 len. 4]: `` My men !
Parsing [sent. 2032 len. 14]: you demand justice , and you shall have it , '' replied Cain .
Parsing [sent. 2033 len. 17]: `` This lad you all know well ; I have brought him up from a child .
Parsing [sent. 2034 len. 22]: He has always disliked our mode of life , and has often requested to leave it , but has been refused .
Parsing [sent. 2035 len. 14]: He challenged me by our own laws , ` Blood for blood ! '
Parsing [sent. 2036 len. 21]: He wounded me ; but he was right in his challenge , and , therefore , I bear no malice .
Parsing [sent. 2037 len. 25]: Had I been aware that he was to have been sent on shore to die with hunger , I would not have permitted it .
Parsing [sent. 2038 len. 6]: What crime had he committed ?
Parsing [sent. 2039 len. 12]: None ; or , if any , it was against me .
Parsing [sent. 2040 len. 17]: He was then sentenced to death for no crime , and you yourselves exclaimed against it .
Parsing [sent. 2041 len. 6]: Is it not true ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2042 len. 13]: `` Yes -- yes , '' replied the majority of the pirates .
Parsing [sent. 2043 len. 18]: `` By a miracle he escapes , and is put in charge of another man 's property .
Parsing [sent. 2044 len. 12]: He is made a prisoner , and now you demand justice .
Parsing [sent. 2045 len. 5]: You shall have it .
Parsing [sent. 2046 len. 38]: Allowing that his life is forfeit for this offence , -- you have already sentenced him , and left him to death unjustly , and therefore are bound in justice to give his life in this instance .
Parsing [sent. 2047 len. 22]: I ask it , my men , not only as his right , but as a favour to your captain . ''
Parsing [sent. 2048 len. 9]: `` Agreed ; it 's all fair ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2049 len. 9]: exclaimed the majority of the pirate 's crew .
Parsing [sent. 2050 len. 40]: `` My men , I thank you , '' replied Cain ; `` and in return , as soon as we arrive at the Caicos , my share of the plunder on board shall be divided among you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2051 len. 25]: This last observation completely turned the tables in favour of the captain ; and those who had joined Hawkhurst now sided with the captain .
Parsing [sent. 2052 len. 6]: Hawkhurst looked like a demon .
Parsing [sent. 2053 len. 26]: `` Let those who choose to be bought off , take your money , '' replied he ; `` but _ I will not _ .
Parsing [sent. 2054 len. 14]: Blood for blood I will have ; and so I give you warning .
Parsing [sent. 2055 len. 13]: That lad 's life is mine , and have it I will !
Parsing [sent. 2056 len. 8]: Prevent me , if you can ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2057 len. 20]: continued the mate , holding up his clenched hand , and shaking it almost in the pirate-captain 's face .
Parsing [sent. 2058 len. 10]: The blood mantled even to the forehead of Cain .
Parsing [sent. 2059 len. 27]: One moment he raised himself to his utmost height , then seizing a hand spike , which lay near , he felled Hawkhurst to the deck .
Parsing [sent. 2060 len. 8]: `` Take that for your mutiny ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2061 len. 11]: exclaimed Cain , putting his foot on Hawkhurst 's neck .
Parsing [sent. 2062 len. 9]: `` My lads , I appeal to you .
Parsing [sent. 2063 len. 11]: Is this man worthy to be in command as mate ?
Parsing [sent. 2064 len. 6]: Is he to live ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2065 len. 3]: `` No !
Parsing [sent. 2066 len. 3]: no ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2067 len. 4]: cried the pirates .
Parsing [sent. 2068 len. 4]: `` Death ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2069 len. 4]: Francisco stepped forward .
Parsing [sent. 2070 len. 24]: `` My men , you have granted your captain one favour ; grant me another , which is the life of this man .
Parsing [sent. 2071 len. 21]: Recollect how often he has led you to conquest , and how brave and faithful he has been until now !
Parsing [sent. 2072 len. 15]: Recollect that he is suffering under his wound , which has made him irritable .
Parsing [sent. 2073 len. 30]: Command you he can not any longer , as he will never have the confidence of your captain ; but let him live , and quit the vessel . ''
Parsing [sent. 2074 len. 27]: `` Be it so , if you agree , '' replied Cain , looking at the men ; `` I do not seek his life . ''
Parsing [sent. 2075 len. 4]: The pirates consented .
Parsing [sent. 2076 len. 15]: Hawkhurst rose slowly from the deck , and was assisted below to his cabin .
Parsing [sent. 2077 len. 27]: The second mate was then appointed as the first , and the choice of the man to fill up the vacancy was left to the pirate-crew .
Parsing [sent. 2078 len. 17]: For three days after this scene all was quiet and orderly on board of the pirate .
Parsing [sent. 2079 len. 49]: Cain , now that he had more fully made up his mind how to act , imparted to Francisco his plans ; and his giving up to the men his share of the booty still on board was , to Francisco , an earnest of his good intentions .
Parsing [sent. 2080 len. 38]: A cordiality , even a kind of feeling which never existed before , was created between them ; but of Francisco 's mother , and the former events of his own life , the pirate never spoke .
Parsing [sent. 2081 len. 38]: Francisco more than once put questions on the subject ; the answer was , -- `` You shall know some of these days , Francisco , but not yet ; you would hate me too much ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2082 len. 24]: The _ Avenger _ was now clear of the English isles , and with light winds running down the shores of Porto Rico .
Parsing [sent. 2083 len. 56]: In the evening of the day on which they had made the land , the schooner was becalmed about three miles from the shore , and the new first mate proposed that he should land in the boat and obtain a further supply of water from a fall which they had discovered with the glasses .
Parsing [sent. 2084 len. 20]: As this was necessary , Cain gave his consent , and the boat quitted the vessel full of breakers .
Parsing [sent. 2085 len. 24]: Now it happened that the _ Avenger _ lay becalmed abreast of the country-seat of Don d'Alfarez , the governor of the island .
Parsing [sent. 2086 len. 50]: Clara had seen the schooner ; and , as usual , had thrown out the white curtain as a signal of recognition ; for there was no perceptible difference , even to a sailor , at that distance , between the _ Avenger _ and the _ Enterprise _ .
Parsing [sent. 2087 len. 21]: She had hastened down to the beach , and hurried into the cave , awaiting the arrival of Edward Templemore .
Parsing [sent. 2088 len. 19]: The pirate-boat landed at the very spot of rendezvous , and the mate leaped out of the boat .
Parsing [sent. 2089 len. 21]: Clara flew to receive her Edward , and was instantly seized by the mate , before she discovered her mistake .
Parsing [sent. 2090 len. 4]: `` Holy Virgin !
Parsing [sent. 2091 len. 7]: who and what are you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2092 len. 8]: cried she , struggling to disengage herself .
Parsing [sent. 2093 len. 12]: `` One who is very fond of a pretty girl ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2094 len. 8]: replied the pirate , still detaining her .
Parsing [sent. 2095 len. 7]: `` Unhand me , wretch ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2096 len. 3]: cried Clara .
Parsing [sent. 2097 len. 10]: `` Are you aware whom you are addressing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2098 len. 4]: `` Not I !
Parsing [sent. 2099 len. 10]: nor do I care , '' replied the pirate .
Parsing [sent. 2100 len. 20]: `` You will perhaps , sir , when you learn that I am the daughter of the governor ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2101 len. 7]: exclaimed Clara , pushing him away .
Parsing [sent. 2102 len. 3]: `` Yes !
Parsing [sent. 2103 len. 3]: by heavens !
Parsing [sent. 2104 len. 25]: you are right , pretty lady , I do care ; for a governor 's daughter will fetch a good ransom at all events .
Parsing [sent. 2105 len. 21]: So come , my lads , a little help here ; for she is as strong as a young mule .
Parsing [sent. 2106 len. 21]: Never mind the water , throw the beakers into the boat again : we have a prize worth taking ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2107 len. 24]: Clara screamed ; but she was gagged with a handkerchief and lifted into the boat , which immediately rowed back to the schooner .
Parsing [sent. 2108 len. 23]: When the mate came on board and reported his capture the pirates were delighted at the prospect of addition to their prize-money .
Parsing [sent. 2109 len. 44]: Cain could not , of course , raise any objections ; it would have been so different from his general practice , that it would have strengthened suspicions already set afloat by Hawkhurst , which Cain was most anxious just then to remove .
Parsing [sent. 2110 len. 27]: He ordered the girl to be taken down into the cabin , hoisted in the boat , and the breeze springing up again , made sail .
Parsing [sent. 2111 len. 32]: In the mean time Francisco was consoling the unfortunate Clara , and assuring her that she need be under no alarm , promising her the protection of himself and the captain .
Parsing [sent. 2112 len. 60]: The poor girl wept bitterly , and it was not until Cain came down into the cabin and corroborated the assurances of Francisco that she could assume any degree of composure ; but to find friends when she had expected every insult and degradation -- for Francisco had acknowledged that the vessel was a pirate -- was some consolation .
Parsing [sent. 2113 len. 12]: The kindness and attention of Francisco restored her to comparative tranquillity .
Parsing [sent. 2114 len. 50]: The next day she confided to him the reason of her coming to the beach , and her mistake with regard to the two vessels , and Francisco and Cain promised her that they would themselves pay her ransom , and not wait until she heard from her father .
Parsing [sent. 2115 len. 20]: To divert her thoughts Francisco talked much about Edward Templemore , and on that subject Clara could always talk .
Parsing [sent. 2116 len. 11]: Every circumstance attending the amour was soon known to Francisco .
Parsing [sent. 2117 len. 16]: But the _ Avenger _ did not gain her rendezvous as soon as she expected .
Parsing [sent. 2118 len. 27]: When to the northward of Porto Rico an English frigate bore down upon her , and the _ Avenger _ was obliged to run for it .
Parsing [sent. 2119 len. 37]: Before the wind is always a schooner 's worst point of sailing , and the chase was continued for three days before a fresh wind from the southward , until they had passed the Bahama Isles .
Parsing [sent. 2120 len. 20]: The pirates suffered much from want of water , as it was necessary still further to reduce their allowance .
Parsing [sent. 2121 len. 37]: The frigate was still in sight , although the _ Avenger _ had dropped her astern when the wind became light , and at last it subsided into a calm , which lasted two days more .
Parsing [sent. 2122 len. 48]: The boats of the frigate were hoisted out on the eve of the second day to attack the schooner , then distant five miles , when a breeze sprang up from the northward , and the schooner being then to windward , left the enemy hull down .
Parsing [sent. 2123 len. 29]: It was not until the next day that Cain ventured to run again to the southward to procure at one of the keys the water so much required .
Parsing [sent. 2124 len. 31]: At last it was obtained , but with difficulty and much loss of time , from the scantiness of the supply , and they again made sail for the Caicos .
Parsing [sent. 2125 len. 39]: But they were so much impeded by contrary winds and contrary currents that it was not until three weeks after they had been chased from Porto Rico that they made out the low land of their former rendezvous .
Parsing [sent. 2126 len. 39]: We must now return to Edward Templemore in the _ Enterprise _ , whom we left off the coast of South America in search of the _ Avenger _ , which had so strangely slipped through their fingers .
Parsing [sent. 2127 len. 27]: Edward had examined the whole coast , ran through the passage and round Trinidad , and then started off to the Leeward Isles in his pursuit .
Parsing [sent. 2128 len. 22]: He had spoken every vessel he met with without gaining any information , and had at last arrived off Porto Rico .
Parsing [sent. 2129 len. 116]: This was no time to think of Clara ; but , as it was not out of his way , he had run down the island , and as it was just before dark when he arrived off that part of the coast where the governor resided , he had hove to for a little while , and had examined the windows : but the signal of recognition was not made , and after waiting till dark he again made sail , mad with disappointment , and fearing that all had been discovered by the governor ; whereas the fact was , that he had only arrived two days after the forcible abduction of Clara .
Parsing [sent. 2130 len. 54]: Once more he directed his attention to the discovery of the pirate , and after a fortnight 's examination of the inlets and bays of the Island of St. Domingo without success , his provisions and water being nearly expended , he returned , in no very happy mood , to Port Royal .
Parsing [sent. 2131 len. 43]: In the mean time the disappearance of Clara had created the greatest confusion in Porto Rico , and upon the examination of her attendant , who was confronted by the friar and the duenna , the amour of her mistress was confessed .
Parsing [sent. 2132 len. 52]: The appearance of the _ Avenger _ off the coast on that evening confirmed their ideas that the Donna Clara had been carried off by the English lieutenant , and Don Alfarez immediately despatched a vessel to Jamaica , complaining of the outrage , and demanding the restoration of his daughter .
Parsing [sent. 2133 len. 23]: This vessel arrived at Port Royal a few days before the _ Enterprise _ , and the admiral was very much astonished .
Parsing [sent. 2134 len. 34]: He returned a very polite answer to Don Alfarez , promising an investigation immediately upon the arrival of the schooner , and to send a vessel with the result of the said investigation .
Parsing [sent. 2135 len. 15]: `` This is a pretty business , '' said the admiral to his secretary .
Parsing [sent. 2136 len. 21]: `` Young madcap , I sent him to look after a pirate and he goes after the governor 's daughter !
Parsing [sent. 2137 len. 20]: By the lord Harry , Mr Templemore , but you and I shall have an account to settle . ''
Parsing [sent. 2138 len. 22]: `` I can hardly believe it , sir , '' replied the secretary ; `` and yet it does look suspicious .
Parsing [sent. 2139 len. 16]: But on so short an acquaintance -- '' `` Who knows that , Mr Hadley ?
Parsing [sent. 2140 len. 21]: Send for his logs , and let us examine them ; he may have been keeping up the acquaintance . ''
Parsing [sent. 2141 len. 48]: The logs of the _ Enterprise _ were examined , and there were the fatal words -- Porto Rico , Porto Rico , bearing in every division of the compass , and in every separate cruise , nay , even when the schooner was charged with despatches .
Parsing [sent. 2142 len. 9]: `` Plain enough , '' said the admiral .
Parsing [sent. 2143 len. 12]: `` Confounded young scamp , to embroil me in this way !
Parsing [sent. 2144 len. 26]: Not that his marrying the girl is any business of mine ; but I will punish him for disobedience of orders , at all events .
Parsing [sent. 2145 len. 10]: Try him by a court-martial , by heavens ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2146 len. 19]: The secretary made no reply : he knew very well that the admiral would do no such thing .
Parsing [sent. 2147 len. 23]: `` The _ Enterprise _ anchored at daylight , sir , '' reported the secretary as the admiral sat down to breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 2148 len. 8]: `` And where 's Mr Templemore ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2149 len. 8]: `` He is outside in the veranda .
Parsing [sent. 2150 len. 19]: They have told him below of what he has been accused , and he swears it is false .
Parsing [sent. 2151 len. 16]: I believe him , sir , for he appears half mad at the intelligence . ''
Parsing [sent. 2152 len. 5]: `` Stop a moment .
Parsing [sent. 2153 len. 8]: Have you looked over his log ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2154 len. 5]: `` Yes , sir .
Parsing [sent. 2155 len. 36]: It appears that he was off Porto Rico on the 19th ; but the Spanish governor 's letter says that he was there on the 17th , and again made his appearance on the 19th .
Parsing [sent. 2156 len. 28]: I mentioned it to him , and he declares upon his honour that he was only there on the 19th , as stated in his log . ''
Parsing [sent. 2157 len. 13]: `` Well , let him come in and speak for himself . ''
Parsing [sent. 2158 len. 11]: Edward came in , in a state of great agitation .
Parsing [sent. 2159 len. 13]: `` Well , Mr Templemore , you have been playing pretty tricks !
Parsing [sent. 2160 len. 7]: What is all this , sir ?
Parsing [sent. 2161 len. 13]: Where is the girl , sir -- the governor 's daughter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2162 len. 29]: `` Where she is , sir , I can not pretend to say ; but I feel convinced that she has been carried off by the pirates . ''
Parsing [sent. 2163 len. 3]: `` Pirates !
Parsing [sent. 2164 len. 7]: Poor girl , I pity her !
Parsing [sent. 2165 len. 10]: -- and -- I pity you too , Edward .
Parsing [sent. 2166 len. 15]: Come , sit down here , and tell me all that has happened . ''
Parsing [sent. 2167 len. 22]: Edward knew the admiral 's character so well , that he immediately disclosed all that had passed between him and Clara .
Parsing [sent. 2168 len. 68]: He then stated how the _ Avenger _ had escaped him by deceiving the frigate , and the agreement made with Clara to meet for the future on the beach , and his conviction that the pirate schooner , so exactly similar in appearance to the _ Enterprise _ , must have preceded him at Porto Rico , and have carried off the object of his attachment .
Parsing [sent. 2169 len. 29]: Although Edward might have been severely taken to task , yet the admiral pitied him , and , therefore , said nothing about his visits to Porto Rico .
Parsing [sent. 2170 len. 36]: When breakfast was over he ordered the signal to be made for a sloop of war to prepare to weigh , and the _ Enterprise _ to be revictualled by the boats of the squadron .
Parsing [sent. 2171 len. 41]: `` Now , Edward , you and the _ Comus _ shall sail in company after this rascally pirate , and I trust you will give me a good account of her , and also of the governor 's daughter .
Parsing [sent. 2172 len. 6]: Cheer up , my boy !
Parsing [sent. 2173 len. 16]: depend upon it they will try for ransom before they do her any injury . ''
Parsing [sent. 2174 len. 65]: That evening the _ Enterprise _ and _ Comus _ sailed on their expedition , and having run by Porto Rico and delivered a letter to the governor , they steered to the northward , and early the next morning made the land of the Caicos , just as the _ Avenger _ had skirted the reefs and bore up for the narrow entrance .
Parsing [sent. 2175 len. 6]: `` There she is ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2176 len. 12]: exclaimed Edward ; `` there she is , by heavens ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2177 len. 17]: making the signal for the enemy , which was immediately answered by the _ Comus _ .
Parsing [sent. 2178 len. 3]: CHAPTER SIXTEEN .
Parsing [sent. 2179 len. 3]: THE CAICOS .
Parsing [sent. 2180 len. 39]: The small patch of islands called the Caicos , or Cayques , is situated about two degrees to the northward of Saint Domingo , and is nearly the southernmost of a chain which extends up to the Bahamas .
Parsing [sent. 2181 len. 60]: Most of the islands of this chain are uninhabited , but were formerly the resort of piratical vessels , -- the reefs and shoals with which they are all surrounded afforded them protection from their larger pursuers , and the passages through this dangerous navigation being known only to the pirates who frequented them , proved an additional security .
Parsing [sent. 2182 len. 64]: The largest of the Caicos islands forms a curve , like an opened horseshoe , to the southward , with safe and protected anchorage when once in the bay on the southern side ; but , previous to arriving at the anchorage , there are coral reefs , extending upwards of forty miles , through which it is necessary to conduct a vessel .
Parsing [sent. 2183 len. 19]: This passage is extremely intricate , but was well known to Hawkhurst , who had hitherto been pilot .
Parsing [sent. 2184 len. 37]: Cain was not so well acquainted with it and it required the greatest care in taking in the vessel , as , on the present occasion , Hawkhurst could not be called upon for this service .
Parsing [sent. 2185 len. 44]: The islands themselves -- for there were several of them -- were composed of coral rock ; a few cocoa-trees raised their lofty heads where there was sufficient earth for vegetation , and stunted brush-wood rose up between the interstices of the rocks .
Parsing [sent. 2186 len. 95]: But the chief peculiarity of the islands , and which rendered them suitable to those who frequented them , was the numerous caves with which the rocks were perforated , some above high-water mark , but the majority with the sea-water flowing in and out of them , in some cases merely rushing in , and at high-water filling deep pools , which were detached from each other when the tide receded , in others with a sufficient depth of water at all times to allow you to pull in with a large boat .
Parsing [sent. 2187 len. 33]: It is hardly necessary to observe how convenient the higher and dry caves were as receptacles for articles which were intended to be concealed until an opportunity occurred for disposing of them .
Parsing [sent. 2188 len. 50]: In our last chapter we stated that , just as the _ Avenger _ had entered the passage through the reefs , the _ Comus _ and _ Enterprise _ hove in sight and discovered her : but it will be necessary to explain the positions of the vessels .
Parsing [sent. 2189 len. 34]: The _ Avenger _ had entered the southern channel , with the wind from the southward , and had carefully sounded her way for about four miles , under little or no sail .
Parsing [sent. 2190 len. 54]: The _ Enterprise _ and _ Comus _ had been examining Turk 's Island , to the eastward of the Caicos , and had passed to the northward of it on the larboard tack , standing in for the northern point of the reef , which joined on to the great Caicos Island .
Parsing [sent. 2191 len. 33]: They were , therefore , in a situation to intercept the _ Avenger _ before she arrived at her anchorage , had it not been for the reefs that barred their passage .
Parsing [sent. 2192 len. 77]: The only plan which the English vessels could act upon was to beat to the southward , so as to arrive at the entrance of the passage , when the _ Enterprise _ would , of course , find sufficient water to follow the _ Avenger _ ; for , as the passage was too narrow to beat through , and the wind was from the southward , the _ Avenger _ could not possibly escape .
Parsing [sent. 2193 len. 39]: She was caught in a trap ; and all that she had to trust to was the defence which she might be able to make in her stronghold against the force which could be employed in the attack .
Parsing [sent. 2194 len. 38]: The breeze was fresh from the southward , and appeared inclined to increase , when the _ Comus _ and _ Enterprise _ made all sail , and worked , in short tacks , outside the reef .
Parsing [sent. 2195 len. 27]: On board the _ Avenger _ , the enemy and their motions were clearly distinguished , and Cain perceived that he was in an awkward dilemma .
Parsing [sent. 2196 len. 72]: That they would be attacked he had no doubt ; and although , at any other time , he would almost have rejoiced in such an opportunity of discomfiting his assailants , yet now he thought very differently , and would have sacrificed almost everything to have been able to avoid the rencontre , and be permitted quietly to withdraw himself from his associates , without the spilling of more blood .
Parsing [sent. 2197 len. 28]: Francisco was equally annoyed at this unfortunate collision ; but no words were exchanged between him and the pirate-captain during the time that they were on deck .
Parsing [sent. 2198 len. 34]: It was about nine o'clock , when having safely passed nearly half through the channel , that Cain ordered the kedge-anchor to be dropped , and sent down the people to their breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 2199 len. 19]: Francisco went down into the cabin , and was explaining their situation to Clara , when Cain entered .
Parsing [sent. 2200 len. 16]: He threw himself on the locker , and appeared lost in deep and sombre meditation .
Parsing [sent. 2201 len. 9]: `` What do you intend to do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2202 len. 3]: said Francisco .
Parsing [sent. 2203 len. 18]: `` I do not know ; I will not decide myself , Francisco , '' replied Cain .
Parsing [sent. 2204 len. 23]: `` If I were to act upon my own judgment , probably I should allow the schooner to remain where she is .
Parsing [sent. 2205 len. 73]: They can only attack in the boats , and , in such a case , I do not fear ; whereas , if we run right through , we allow the other schooner to follow us , without defending the passage ; and we may be attacked by her in the deep water inside , and overpowered by the number of men the two vessels will be able to bring against us .
Parsing [sent. 2206 len. 25]: On the other hand , we certainly may defend the schooner from the shore as well as on board ; but we are weak-handed .
Parsing [sent. 2207 len. 16]: I shall , however , call up the ship 's company and let them decide .
Parsing [sent. 2208 len. 15]: God knows , if left to me I would not fight at all . ''
Parsing [sent. 2209 len. 9]: `` Is there no way of escape ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2210 len. 3]: resumed Francisco .
Parsing [sent. 2211 len. 67]: `` Yes , we might abandon the schooner ; and this night , when they would not expect it , run with the boats through the channel between the great island and the north Cayque : but that I dare n't propose , and the men would not listen to it : indeed , I very much doubt if the enemy will allow us the time .
Parsing [sent. 2212 len. 25]: I knew this morning , long before we saw those vessels , that my fate would be decided before the sun went down . ''
Parsing [sent. 2213 len. 7]: `` What do you mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2214 len. 34]: `` I mean this , Francisco , '' said Cain ; `` that your mother , who always has visited me in my dreams whenever anything -LRB- dreadful now to think of ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 2215 len. 38]: was about to take place , appeared to me last night ; and there was sorrow and pity in her sweet face as she mournfully waved her hand , as if to summon me to follow her .
Parsing [sent. 2216 len. 5]: Yes , thank God !
Parsing [sent. 2217 len. 15]: she no longer looked upon me as for many years she has done . ''
Parsing [sent. 2218 len. 15]: Francisco made no answer ; and Cain again seemed to be lost in meditation .
Parsing [sent. 2219 len. 26]: After a little while Cain rose , and taking a small packet from one of the drawers , put it into the hands of Francisco .
Parsing [sent. 2220 len. 39]: `` Preserve that , '' said the pirate-captain ; `` should any accident happen to me , it will tell you who was your mother ; and it also contains directions for finding treasure which I have buried .
Parsing [sent. 2221 len. 8]: I leave everything to you , Francisco .
Parsing [sent. 2222 len. 22]: It has been unfairly obtained ; but you are not the guilty party , and there are none to claim it .
Parsing [sent. 2223 len. 6]: Do not answer me now .
Parsing [sent. 2224 len. 22]: You may find friends , whom you will make after I am gone , of the same opinion as I am .
Parsing [sent. 2225 len. 12]: I tell you again , be careful of that packet . ''
Parsing [sent. 2226 len. 14]: `` I see little chance of it availing me , '' replied Francisco .
Parsing [sent. 2227 len. 15]: `` If I live , shall I not be considered as a pirate ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2228 len. 12]: `` No , no ; you can prove the contrary . ''
Parsing [sent. 2229 len. 6]: `` I have my doubts .
Parsing [sent. 2230 len. 8]: But God 's will be done ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2231 len. 10]: `` Yes , God 's will be done ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2232 len. 5]: said Cain , mournfully .
Parsing [sent. 2233 len. 12]: `` I dared not have said that a month ago . ''
Parsing [sent. 2234 len. 11]: And the pirate-captain went on deck , followed by Francisco .
Parsing [sent. 2235 len. 27]: The crew of the _ Avenger _ were summoned aft , and called upon to decide as to the measures they considered to be most advisable .
Parsing [sent. 2236 len. 34]: They preferred weighing the anchor and running into the bay , where they would be able to defend the schooner , in their opinion , much better than by remaining where they were .
Parsing [sent. 2237 len. 40]: The crew of the pirate-schooner weighed the anchor and continued their precarious course : the breeze had freshened , and the water was in strong ripples , so that they could no longer see the danger beneath her bottom .
Parsing [sent. 2238 len. 21]: In the meantime , the sloop of war and _ Enterprise _ continued to turn to windward outside the reef .
Parsing [sent. 2239 len. 27]: By noon the wind had considerably increased , and the breakers now turned and broke in wild foam over the coral reefs , in every direction .
Parsing [sent. 2240 len. 24]: The sail was still more reduced on board the _ Avenger _ , and her difficulties increased from the rapidity of her motion .
Parsing [sent. 2241 len. 22]: A storm-jib was set , and the others hauled down yet even under this small sail she flew before the wind .
Parsing [sent. 2242 len. 13]: Cain stood at the bowsprit , giving his directions to the helmsman .
Parsing [sent. 2243 len. 13]: More than once they had grazed the rocks and were clear again .
Parsing [sent. 2244 len. 16]: Spars were towed astern , and every means resorted to , to check her way .
Parsing [sent. 2245 len. 17]: They had no guide but the breaking of the wild water on each side of them .
Parsing [sent. 2246 len. 20]: `` Why should not Hawkhurst , who knows the passage so well , be made to pilot us ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2247 len. 13]: said the boatswain to those who were near him on the forecastle .
Parsing [sent. 2248 len. 5]: `` To be sure !
Parsing [sent. 2249 len. 7]: let 's have him up ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2250 len. 14]: cried several of the crew ; and some of them went down below .
Parsing [sent. 2251 len. 13]: In a minute they reappeared with Hawkhurst , whom they led forward .
Parsing [sent. 2252 len. 18]: He did not make any resistance , and the crew demanded that he should pilot the vessel .
Parsing [sent. 2253 len. 8]: `` And suppose I will not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2254 len. 5]: said Hawkhurst , coolly .
Parsing [sent. 2255 len. 16]: `` Then you lose your passage , that 's all , '' replied the boatswain .
Parsing [sent. 2256 len. 10]: `` Is it not so , my lads ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2257 len. 8]: continued he , appealing to the crew .
Parsing [sent. 2258 len. 17]: `` Yes ; either take us safe in , or -- overboard , '' replied several .
Parsing [sent. 2259 len. 40]: `` I do not mind that threat , my lads , '' replied Hawkhurst ; `` you have all known me as a good man and true , and it 's not likely that I shall desert you now .
Parsing [sent. 2260 len. 31]: Well , since your captain there can not save you , I suppose I must ; but , '' exclaimed he , looking about him , `` how 's this ?
Parsing [sent. 2261 len. 8]: We are out of the passage already .
Parsing [sent. 2262 len. 16]: Yes -- and whether we can get into it again I can not tell . ''
Parsing [sent. 2263 len. 21]: `` We are not out of the passage , '' said Cain ; `` you know we are not . ''
Parsing [sent. 2264 len. 24]: `` Well , then , if the captain knows better than I , he had better take you through , '' rejoined Hawkhurst .
Parsing [sent. 2265 len. 21]: But the crew thought differently , and insisted that Hawkhurst , who well knew the channel , should take charge .
Parsing [sent. 2266 len. 12]: Cain retired aft , as Hawkhurst went out on the bowsprit .
Parsing [sent. 2267 len. 34]: `` I will do my best , my lads , '' said Hawkhurst `` but recollect , if we strike in trying to get into the right channel , do not blame me .
Parsing [sent. 2268 len. 40]: Starboard a little -- starboard yet -- steady , so -- there 's the true passage my lads , '' cried he , pointing to some smoother water between the breakers ; `` port a little -- steady . ''
Parsing [sent. 2269 len. 47]: But Hawkhurst , who knew that he was to be put on shore as soon as convenient , had resolved to lose the schooner , even if his own life were forfeited , and he was now running her out of the passage on the rocks .
Parsing [sent. 2270 len. 15]: A minute after he had conned her , she struck heavily again and again .
Parsing [sent. 2271 len. 37]: The third time she struck , she came broadside to the wind and heeled over : a sharp coral rock found its way through her slight timbers and planking , and the water poured in rapidly .
Parsing [sent. 2272 len. 14]: During this there was a dead silence on the part of the marauders .
Parsing [sent. 2273 len. 26]: `` My lads , '' said Hawkhurst , `` I have done my best , and now you may throw me overboard if you please .
Parsing [sent. 2274 len. 18]: It was not my fault , but his , '' continued he , pointing to the captain .
Parsing [sent. 2275 len. 36]: `` It is of little consequence whose fault it was , Mr Hawkhurst , '' replied Cain ; `` we will settle that point by-and-by ; at present we have too much on our hands .
Parsing [sent. 2276 len. 5]: Out boats , men !
Parsing [sent. 2277 len. 17]: as fast as you can , and let every man provide himself with arms and ammunition .
Parsing [sent. 2278 len. 3]: Be cool !
Parsing [sent. 2279 len. 20]: the schooner is fixed hard enough , and will not go down ; we shall save everything by-and-by . ''
Parsing [sent. 2280 len. 9]: The pirates obeyed the orders of the captain .
Parsing [sent. 2281 len. 10]: The three boats were hoisted out and lowered down .
Parsing [sent. 2282 len. 20]: In the first were placed all the wounded men and Clara d'Alfarez , who was assisted up by Francisco .
Parsing [sent. 2283 len. 30]: As soon as the men had provided themselves with arms , Francisco , to protect Clara , offered to take charge of her , and the boat shoved off .
Parsing [sent. 2284 len. 25]: The men-of-war had seen the _ Avenger _ strike on the rocks , and the preparations of the crew to take to their boats .
Parsing [sent. 2285 len. 59]: They immediately hove to , hoisted out and manned their own boats , with the hopes of cutting them off before they could gain the island and prepare for a vigorous defence ; for , although the vessels could not approach the reefs , there was sufficient water in many places for the boats to pass over them .
Parsing [sent. 2286 len. 32]: Shortly after Francisco , in the first boat , had shoved off from the _ Avenger _ , the boats of the men-of-war were darting through the surf to intercept them .
Parsing [sent. 2287 len. 28]: The pirates perceived this , and hastened their arrangements ; a second boat soon left her , and into that Hawkhurst leaped as it was shoving off .
Parsing [sent. 2288 len. 55]: Cain remained on board , going round the lower decks to ascertain if any of the wounded men were left ; he then quitted the schooner in the last boat and followed the others , being about a quarter of a mile astern of the second , in which Hawkhurst had secured his place .
Parsing [sent. 2289 len. 30]: At the time that Cain quitted the schooner , it was difficult to say whether the men-of-war 's boats would succeed in intercepting any of the pirate 's boats .
Parsing [sent. 2290 len. 55]: Both parties exerted themselves to their utmost ; and when the first boat , with Francisco and Clara , landed , the headmost of the assailants was not much more than half a mile from them ; but , shallow water intervening , there was a delay , which was favourable to the pirate .
Parsing [sent. 2291 len. 18]: Hawkhurst landed in his boat as the launch of the _ Comus _ fired her eighteen-pound carronade .
Parsing [sent. 2292 len. 49]: The last boat was yet two hundred yards from the beach , when another shot from the _ Comus 's _ launch , which had been unable hitherto to find a passage through the reef , struck her on the counter , and she filled and went down .
Parsing [sent. 2293 len. 6]: `` He is gone ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2294 len. 53]: exclaimed Francisco , who had led Clara to a cave , and stood at the mouth of it to protect her : `` they have sunk his boat -- no , he is swimming to the shore , and will be here soon , long before the English seamen can land . ''
Parsing [sent. 2295 len. 4]: This was true .
Parsing [sent. 2296 len. 62]: Cain was breasting the water manfully , making for a small cove nearer to where the boat was sunk than the one in which Francisco had landed with Clara and the wounded men , and divided from the other by a ridge of rocks which separated the sandy beach , and extended some way into the water before they were submerged .
Parsing [sent. 2297 len. 48]: Francisco could easily distinguish the pirate-captain from the other men , who also were swimming for the beach ; for Cain was far ahead of them , and as he gained nearer to the shore he was shut from Francisco 's sight by the ridge of rocks .
Parsing [sent. 2298 len. 15]: Francisco , anxious for his safety , climbed up the rocks and was watching .
Parsing [sent. 2299 len. 52]: Cain was within a few yards of the beach when there was the report of a musket ; the pirate-captain was seen to raise his body convulsively half out of the water -- he floundered -- the clear blue wave was discoloured -- he sank , and was seen no more .
Parsing [sent. 2300 len. 26]: Francisco darted forward from the rocks , and perceived Hawkhurst , standing beneath them with the musket in his hand , which he was recharging .
Parsing [sent. 2301 len. 4]: `` Villain ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2302 len. 11]: exclaimed Francisco , `` you shall account for this . ''
Parsing [sent. 2303 len. 10]: Hawkhurst had reprimed his musket and shut the pan .
Parsing [sent. 2304 len. 19]: `` Not to you , '' replied Hawkhurst , levelling his piece , and taking aim at Francisco .
Parsing [sent. 2305 len. 32]: The ball struck Francisco on the breast ; he reeled back from his position , staggered across the sand , gained the cave , and fell at the feet of Clara .
Parsing [sent. 2306 len. 6]: `` Oh , God ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2307 len. 10]: exclaimed the poor girl , `` are you hurt ?
Parsing [sent. 2308 len. 10]: who is there then , to protect me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2309 len. 36]: `` I hardly know , '' replied Francisco , faintly ; and , at intervals , `` I feel no wound , I feel stronger ; '' and Francisco put his hand to his heart .
Parsing [sent. 2310 len. 64]: Clara opened his vest , and found that the packet given to Francisco by Cain , and which he had deposited in his breast , had been struck by the bullet , which had done him no injury further than the violent concussion of the blow -- notwithstanding he was faint from the shock , and his head fell upon Clara 's bosom .
Parsing [sent. 2311 len. 17]: But we must relate the proceedings of those who were mixed up in this exciting scene .
Parsing [sent. 2312 len. 36]: Edward Templemore had watched from his vessel , with an eager and painful curiosity , the motions of the schooner -- her running on the rocks , and the subsequent actions of the intrepid marauders .
Parsing [sent. 2313 len. 79]: The long telescope enabled him to perceive distinctly all that passed , and his feelings were increased into a paroxysm of agony when his straining eyes beheld the white and fluttering habiliments of a female for a moment at the gunwale of the stranded vessel -- her descent , as it appeared to him , nothing loth , into the boat -- the arms held out to receive , and the extension of hers to meet those offered .
Parsing [sent. 2314 len. 5]: Could it be Clara ?
Parsing [sent. 2315 len. 18]: Where was the reluctance , the unavailing attempts at resistance , which should have characterised her situation ?
Parsing [sent. 2316 len. 38]: Excited by feelings which he dared not analyse , he threw down his glass , and seizing his sword , sprang into the boat , which was ready manned alongside , desiring the others to follow him .
Parsing [sent. 2317 len. 55]: For once , and the only time in his existence when approaching the enemy , did he feel his heart sink within him -- a cold tremor ran through his whole frame , and as he called to mind the loose morals and desperate habits of the pirates , horrible thoughts entered his imagination .
Parsing [sent. 2318 len. 44]: As he neared the shore , he stood up in the stern-sheets of the boat , pale , haggard , and with trembling lips ; and the intensity of his feelings would have been intolerable but for a more violent thirst for revenge .
Parsing [sent. 2319 len. 27]: He clenched his sword , while the quick throbs of his heart seemed , at every pulsation , to repeat to him his thoughts of blood !
Parsing [sent. 2320 len. 2]: blood !
Parsing [sent. 2321 len. 2]: blood !
Parsing [sent. 2322 len. 67]: He approached the small bay and perceived that there was a female at the mouth of the cave -- nearer and nearer , and he was certain that it was his Clara -- her name was on his lips when he heard the two shots fired one after another by Hawkhurst -- he saw the retreat and fall of Francisco -- when , madness to behold !
Parsing [sent. 2323 len. 24]: he perceived Clara rush forward , and there lay the young man supported by her , and with his head on her bosom .
Parsing [sent. 2324 len. 7]: Could he believe what he saw !
Parsing [sent. 2325 len. 7]: could she really be his betrothed !
Parsing [sent. 2326 len. 40]: Yes , there she was , supporting the handsome figure of a young man , and that man a pirate -- she had even put her hand into his vest , and was now watching over his reviving form .
Parsing [sent. 2327 len. 35]: Edward could bear no more : he covered his eyes , and now , maddened with jealousy , in a voice of thunder , he called out : `` Give way , my lads !
Parsing [sent. 2328 len. 8]: for your lives , give way ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2329 len. 49]: The gig was within half-a-dozen strokes of the oar from the beach , and Clara , unconscious of wrong , had just taken the packet of papers from Francisco 's vest , when Hawkhurst made his appearance from behind the rocks which separated the two little sandy coves .
Parsing [sent. 2330 len. 46]: Francisco had recovered his breath , and , perceiving the approach of Hawkhurst , he sprang upon his feet to recover his musket ; but , before he could succeed , Hawkhurst had closed in with him , and a short and dreadful struggle ensued .
Parsing [sent. 2331 len. 59]: It would soon have terminated fatally to Francisco , for the superior strength of Hawkhurst had enabled him to bear down the body of his opponent with his knee ; and he was fast strangling him by twisting his handkerchief round his throat , while Clara shrieked , and attempted in vain to tear the pirate from him .
Parsing [sent. 2332 len. 82]: As the prostrate Francisco was fast blackening into a corse , and the maiden screamed for pity , and became frantic in her efforts for his rescue , the boat dashed high up on the sand ; and , with the bound of a maddened tiger , Edward sprang upon Hawkhurst , tearing him down on his back , and severing his wrist with his sword-blade until his hold of Francisco was relaxed , and he wrestled in his own defence .
Parsing [sent. 2333 len. 8]: `` Seize him , my lads ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2334 len. 34]: said Edward , pointing with his left hand to Hawkhurst ; as with his sword directed to the body of Francisco he bitterly continued , '' _ This victim is mine _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2335 len. 23]: But whatever were his intentions , they were frustrated by Clara 's recognition , who shrieked out , `` My Edward ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2336 len. 14]: sprang into his arms , and was immediately in a state of insensibility .
Parsing [sent. 2337 len. 60]: The seamen who had secured Hawkhurst looked upon the scene with curious astonishment , while Edward waited with mingled feelings of impatience and doubt for Clara 's recovery : he wished to be assured by her that he was mistaken , and he turned again and again from her face to that of Francisco , who was fast recovering .
Parsing [sent. 2338 len. 14]: During this painful suspense , Hawkhurst was bound and made to sit down .
Parsing [sent. 2339 len. 3]: `` Edward !
Parsing [sent. 2340 len. 4]: dear Edward ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2341 len. 29]: said Clara , at last , in a faint voice , clinging more closely to him ; `` and am I then rescued by thee , dearest ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2342 len. 13]: Edward felt the appeal ; but his jealousy had not yet subsided .
Parsing [sent. 2343 len. 8]: `` Who is that , Clara ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2344 len. 4]: said he sternly .
Parsing [sent. 2345 len. 5]: `` It is Francisco .
Parsing [sent. 2346 len. 10]: No pirate , Edward , but my preserver . ''
Parsing [sent. 2347 len. 6]: `` Ha , ha ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2348 len. 15]: laughed Hawkhurst , with a bitter sneer , for he perceived how matters stood .
Parsing [sent. 2349 len. 10]: Edward Templemore turned towards him with an inquiring look .
Parsing [sent. 2350 len. 6]: `` Ha , ha ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2351 len. 13]: continued Hawkhurst ; `` why , he is the captain 's son !
Parsing [sent. 2352 len. 5]: No pirate , eh ?
Parsing [sent. 2353 len. 17]: Well , what will women not swear to , to save those they dote upon ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2354 len. 18]: `` If the captain 's son , '' said Edward , `` why were you contending ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2355 len. 11]: `` Because just now I shot his scoundrel father . ''
Parsing [sent. 2356 len. 4]: `` Edward ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2357 len. 34]: said Clara , solemnly , `` this is no time for explanation , but , as I hope for mercy , what I have said is true ; believe not the villain . ''
Parsing [sent. 2358 len. 54]: `` Yes , '' said Francisco , who was now sitting up , `` believe him when he says that he shot the captain , for that is true ; but , sir , if you value your own peace of mind , believe nothing to the prejudice of that young lady . ''
Parsing [sent. 2359 len. 28]: `` I hardly know what to believe , '' muttered Edward Templemore ; `` but , as the lady says , this is no time for explanation .
Parsing [sent. 2360 len. 47]: With your permission , madam , '' said he to Clara , `` my coxswain will see you in safety on board of the schooner , or the other vessel , if you prefer it ; my duty will not allow me to accompany you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2361 len. 54]: Clara darted a reproachful yet fond look on Edward , as , with swimming eyes , she was led by the coxswain to the boat , which had been joined by the launch of the _ Comus _ , the crew of which were , with their officers , wading to the beach .
Parsing [sent. 2362 len. 30]: The men of the gig remained until they had given Hawkhurst and Francisco in charge of the other seamen , and then shoved off with Clara for the schooner .
Parsing [sent. 2363 len. 52]: Edward Templemore gave one look at the gig as it conveyed Clara on board , and ordering Hawkhurst and Francisco to be taken to the launch , and a guard to be kept over them , went up , with the remainder of the men , in pursuit of the pirates .
Parsing [sent. 2364 len. 46]: During the scene we have described , the other boats of the men-of-war had landed on the island , and the _ Avenger 's _ crew , deprived of their leaders , and scattered in every direction , were many of them slain or captured .
Parsing [sent. 2365 len. 62]: In about two hours it was supposed that the majority of the pirates had been accounted for , and the prisoners being now very numerous , it was decided that the boats should return with them to the _ Comus _ , the captain of which vessel , as commanding officer , would then issue orders as to their future proceedings .
Parsing [sent. 2366 len. 41]: The captured pirates , when mustered on the deck of the _ Comus _ , amounted to nearly sixty , out of which number one-half were those who had been sent on shore wounded , and had surrendered without resistance .
Parsing [sent. 2367 len. 34]: Of killed there were fifteen ; and it was conjectured that as many more had been drowned in the boat when she was sunk by the shot from the carronade of the launch .
Parsing [sent. 2368 len. 35]: Although , by the account given by the captured pirates , the majority were secured , yet there was reason to suppose that some were still left on the island concealed in the caves .
Parsing [sent. 2369 len. 68]: As the captain of the _ Comus _ had orders to return as soon as possible , he decided to sail immediately for Port Royal with the prisoners , leaving the _ Enterprise _ to secure the remainder , if there were any , and recover anything of value which might be left in the wreck of the _ Avenger _ , and then to destroy her .
Parsing [sent. 2370 len. 12]: With the usual celerity of the service these orders were obeyed .
Parsing [sent. 2371 len. 89]: The pirates , among whom Francisco was included , were secured , the boats hoisted up , and in half an hour the _ Comus _ displayed her ensign , and made all sail on a wind , leaving Edward Templemore with the _ Enterprise _ , at the back of the reef , to perform the duties entailed upon him ; and Clara , who was on board of the schooner , to remove the suspicion and jealousy which had arisen in the bosom of her lover .
Parsing [sent. 2372 len. 3]: CHAPTER SEVENTEEN .
Parsing [sent. 2373 len. 3]: THE TRIAL .
Parsing [sent. 2374 len. 33]: In a week , the _ Comus _ arrived at Port Royal , and the captain went up to the Penn to inform the admiral of the successful result of the expedition .
Parsing [sent. 2375 len. 18]: `` Thank God , '' said the admiral , `` we have caught these villains at last !
Parsing [sent. 2376 len. 9]: A little hanging will do them no harm .
Parsing [sent. 2377 len. 10]: The captain , you say , was drowned ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2378 len. 37]: `` So it is reported , sir , '' replied Captain Manly ; `` he was in the last boat which left the schooner , and she was sunk by a shot from the launch . ''
Parsing [sent. 2379 len. 15]: `` I am sorry for that ; the death was too good for him .
Parsing [sent. 2380 len. 29]: However , we must make an example of the rest ; they must be tried by the Admiralty Court , which has the jurisdiction of the high seas .
Parsing [sent. 2381 len. 16]: Send them on shore , Manly , and we wash our hands of them . ''
Parsing [sent. 2382 len. 34]: `` Very good , sir : but there are still some left on the island , we have reason to believe ; and the _ Enterprise _ is in search of them . ''
Parsing [sent. 2383 len. 10]: `` By-the-by , did Templemore find his lady ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2384 len. 29]: `` Oh yes , sir ; and -- all 's right , I believe : but I had very little to say to him on the subject . ''
Parsing [sent. 2385 len. 4]: `` Humph ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2386 len. 4]: replied the admiral .
Parsing [sent. 2387 len. 8]: `` I am glad to hear it .
Parsing [sent. 2388 len. 14]: Well , send them on shore , Manly , to the proper authorities .
Parsing [sent. 2389 len. 17]: If any more be found , they must be hung afterwards when Templemore brings them in .
Parsing [sent. 2390 len. 19]: I am more pleased at having secured these scoundrels than if we had taken a French frigate . ''
Parsing [sent. 2391 len. 40]: About three weeks after this conversation , the secretary reported to the admiral that the _ Enterprise _ had made her number outside ; but that she was becalmed , and would not probably be in until the evening .
Parsing [sent. 2392 len. 22]: `` That 's a pity , '' replied the admiral ; `` for the pirates are to be tried this morning .
Parsing [sent. 2393 len. 10]: He may have more of them on board . ''
Parsing [sent. 2394 len. 30]: `` Very true , sir ; but the trial will hardly be over to-day : the judge will not be in court till one o'clock at the soonest . ''
Parsing [sent. 2395 len. 25]: `` It 's of little consequence , certainly ; as it is , there are so many that they must be hanged by divisions .
Parsing [sent. 2396 len. 19]: However , as he is within signal distance , let them telegraph ` Pirates now on trial . '
Parsing [sent. 2397 len. 14]: He can pull on shore in his gig , if he pleases . ''
Parsing [sent. 2398 len. 36]: It was about noon on the same day that the pirates , and among them Francisco , escorted by a strong guard , were conducted to the Court House , and placed at the bar .
Parsing [sent. 2399 len. 15]: The Court House was crowded to excess , for the interest excited was intense .
Parsing [sent. 2400 len. 27]: Many of them who had been wounded in the attack upon the property of Don Cumanos , and afterwards captured , had died in their confinement .
Parsing [sent. 2401 len. 39]: Still forty-five were placed at the bar ; and their picturesque costume , their bearded faces , and the atrocities which they had committed , created in those present a sensation of anxiety mingled with horror and indignation .
Parsing [sent. 2402 len. 15]: Two of the youngest amongst them had been permitted to turn king 's evidence .
Parsing [sent. 2403 len. 49]: They had been on board of the _ Avenger _ but a few months ; still their testimony as to the murder of the crews of three West India ships , and the attack upon the property of Don Cumanos , was quite sufficient to condemn the remainder .
Parsing [sent. 2404 len. 38]: Much time was necessarily expended in going through the forms of the court ; in the pirates answering to their various names ; and , lastly , in taking down the detailed evidence of the above men .
Parsing [sent. 2405 len. 27]: It was late when the evidence was read over to the pirates , and they were asked if they had anything to offer in their defence .
Parsing [sent. 2406 len. 16]: The question was repeated by the judge ; when Hawkhurst was the first to speak .
Parsing [sent. 2407 len. 27]: To save himself he could scarcely hope ; his only object was to prevent Francisco pleading his cause successfully , and escaping the same disgraceful death .
Parsing [sent. 2408 len. 374]: Hawkhurst declared that he had been some time on board the _ Avenger _ , but that he had been taken out of a vessel and forced to serve against his will , as could be proved by the captain 's son , who stood there -LRB- pointing to Francisco -RRB- , who had been in the schooner since her first fitting out : -- that he had always opposed the captain , who would not part with him , because he was the only one on board who was competent to navigate the schooner : that he had intended to rise against him , and take the vessel , having often stimulated the crew so to do ; and that , as the other men , as well as the captain 's son , could prove , if they chose , he actually was in confinement for that attempt when the schooner was entering the passage to the Caicos ; and that he was only released because he was acquainted with the passage , and threatened to be thrown overboard if he did not take her in ; that , at every risk , he had run her on the rocks ; and aware that the captain would murder him , he had shot Cain as he was swimming to the shore , as the captain 's son could prove ; for he had taxed him with it , and he was actually struggling with him for life , when the officers and boat 's crew separated them , and made them both prisoners : that he hardly expected that Francisco , the captain 's son , would tell the truth to save him , as he was his bitter enemy , and in the business at the Magdalen river , which had been long planned -LRB- for Francisco had been sent on shore under the pretence of being wrecked , but , in fact , to ascertain where the booty was , and to assist the pirates in their attack -RRB- , Francisco had taken the opportunity of putting a bullet through his shoulder , which was well known to the other pirates , and Francisco could not venture to deny .
Parsing [sent. 2409 len. 30]: He trusted that the court would order the torture to Francisco , and then he would probably speak the truth ; at all events , let him speak now .
Parsing [sent. 2410 len. 18]: When Hawkhurst had ceased to address the court , there was an anxious pause for some minutes .
Parsing [sent. 2411 len. 47]: The day was fast declining , and most parts of the spacious Court House were already deeply immersed in gloom ; while the light , sober , solemn , and almost sad , gleamed upon the savage and reckless countenances of the prisoners at the bar .
Parsing [sent. 2412 len. 21]: The sun had sunk down behind a mass of heavy yet gorgeous clouds , fringing their edges with molten gold .
Parsing [sent. 2413 len. 22]: Hawkhurst had spoken fluently and energetically , and there was an appearance of almost honesty in his coarse and deep-toned voice .
Parsing [sent. 2414 len. 38]: Even the occasional oaths with which his speech was garnished , but which we have omitted , seemed to be pronounced more in sincerity than in blasphemy , and gave a more forcible impression to his narrative .
Parsing [sent. 2415 len. 68]: We have said , that when he concluded there was a profound silence ; and amid the fast-falling shadows of the evening , those who were present began to feel , for the first time , the awful importance of the drama before them , the number of lives which were trembling upon the verge of existence , depending upon the single word of `` Guilty . ''
Parsing [sent. 2416 len. 39]: This painful silence , this harrowing suspense , was at last broken by a restrained sob from a female ; but owing to the obscurity involving the body of the court , her person could not be distinguished .
Parsing [sent. 2417 len. 25]: The wail of a woman so unexpected -- for who could there be of that sex interested in the fate of these desperate men ?
Parsing [sent. 2418 len. 35]: -- touched the heart of its auditors , and appeared to sow the first seeds of compassionate and humane feeling among those who had hitherto expressed and felt nothing but indignation towards the prisoners .
Parsing [sent. 2419 len. 45]: The judge upon the bench , the counsel at the bar , and the jury impannelled in their box , felt the force of the appeal ; and it softened down the evil impression created by the address of Hawkhurst against the youthful Francisco .
Parsing [sent. 2420 len. 36]: The eyes of all were now directed towards the one doubly accused -- accused not only by the public prosecutor , but even by his associate in crime , -- and the survey was favourable .
Parsing [sent. 2421 len. 91]: They acknowledged that he was one whose personal qualities might indeed challenge the love of woman in his pride , and her lament in his disgrace ; and as their regard was directed towards him , the sun , which had been obscured , now pierced through a break in the mass of clouds , and threw a portion of his glorious beams from a window opposite upon him , and him alone , while all the other prisoners who surrounded him were buried more or less in deep shadow .
Parsing [sent. 2422 len. 42]: It was at once evident that his associates were bold yet commonplace villains -- men who owed their courage , their only virtue perhaps , to their habits , to their physical organisation , or the influence of those around them .
Parsing [sent. 2423 len. 40]: They were mere human butchers , with the only adjunct that , now that the trade was to be exercised upon themselves , they could bear it with sullen apathy -- a feeling how far removed from true fortitude !
Parsing [sent. 2424 len. 28]: Even Hawkhurst , though more commanding than the rest , with all his daring mien and scowl of defiance , looked nothing more than a distinguished ruffian .
Parsing [sent. 2425 len. 35]: With the exception of Francisco , the prisoners had wholly neglected their personal appearance ; and in them the squalid and sordid look of the mendicant seemed allied with the ferocity of the murderer .
Parsing [sent. 2426 len. 58]: Francisco was not only an exception , but formed a beautiful contrast to the others ; and as the evening beams lighted up his figure , he stood at the bar , if not with all the splendour of a hero of romance , certainly a most picturesque and interesting personage , elegantly if not richly attired .
Parsing [sent. 2427 len. 42]: The low sobs at intervals repeated , as if impossible to be checked , seemed to rouse and call him to a sense of the important part which he was called upon to act in the tragedy there and then performing .
Parsing [sent. 2428 len. 65]: His face was pale , yet composed ; his mien at once proud and sorrowful : his eye was bright , yet his glance was not upon those in court , but far away , fixed , like an eagle 's , upon the gorgeous beams of the setting sun , which glowed upon him through the window that was in front of him .
Parsing [sent. 2429 len. 31]: At last the voice of Francisco was heard , and all in that wide court started at the sound -- deep , full , and melodious as the evening chimes .
Parsing [sent. 2430 len. 45]: The ears of those present had , in the profound silence , but just recovered from the harsh , deep-toned , and barbarous idiom of Hawkhurst 's address , when the clear , silvery , yet manly voice of Francisco , riveted their attention .
Parsing [sent. 2431 len. 35]: The jury stretched forth their heads , the counsel and all in court turned anxiously round towards the prisoner , even the judge held up his forefinger to intimate his wish for perfect silence .
Parsing [sent. 2432 len. 38]: `` My lord and gentlemen , '' commenced Francisco , `` when I first found myself in this degrading situation , I had not thought to have spoken or to have uttered one word in my defence .
Parsing [sent. 2433 len. 38]: He that has just now accused me has recommended the torture to be applied ; he has already had his wish , for what torture can be more agonising than to find myself where I now am ?
Parsing [sent. 2434 len. 117]: So tortured , indeed , have I been through a short yet wretched life , that I have often felt that anything short of self-destruction which would release me would be a blessing ; but within these few minutes I have been made to acknowledge that I have still feelings in unison with my fellow-creatures ; that I am not yet fit for death , and all too young , too unprepared to die : for who would not reluctantly leave this world while there is such a beauteous sky to love and look upon , or while there is one female breast who holds him innocent , and has evinced her pity for his misfortunes ?
Parsing [sent. 2435 len. 5]: Yes , my lord !
Parsing [sent. 2436 len. 27]: mercy , and pity , and compassion , have not yet fled from earth ; and therefore do I feel I am too young to die .
Parsing [sent. 2437 len. 4]: God forgive me !
Parsing [sent. 2438 len. 39]: but I thought they had -- for never have they been shown in those with whom by fate I have been connected ; and it has been from this conviction that I have so often longed for death .
Parsing [sent. 2439 len. 33]: And now may that righteous God who judges us not here , but hereafter , enable me to prove that I do not deserve an ignominious punishment from my fellow-sinners -- men !
Parsing [sent. 2440 len. 19]: `` My lord , I know not the subtleties of the laws , nor the intricacy of pleadings .
Parsing [sent. 2441 len. 37]: First , let me assert that I have never robbed ; but I have restored unto the plundered : I have never murdered ; but I have stood between the assassin 's knife and his victim .
Parsing [sent. 2442 len. 31]: For this have I been hated and reviled by my associates , and for this , is my life now threatened by those laws against which I never had offended .
Parsing [sent. 2443 len. 56]: The man who last addressed you has told you that I am the pirate-captain 's son ; it is the assertion of the only irreclaimable and utterly remorseless villain among those who now stand before you to be judged -- the assertion of one whose glory , whose joy , whose solace has been blood-shedding .
Parsing [sent. 2444 len. 30]: `` My lord , I had it from the mouth of the captain himself , previous to his murder by that man , that I was not his son .
Parsing [sent. 2445 len. 3]: His son !
Parsing [sent. 2446 len. 6]: thank God , not so .
Parsing [sent. 2447 len. 16]: Connected with him and in his power I was , most certainly and most incomprehensibly .
Parsing [sent. 2448 len. 32]: Before he died , he delivered me a packet that would have told me who I am ; but I have lost it , and deeply have I felt the loss .
Parsing [sent. 2449 len. 34]: One only fact I gained from him whom they would call my father , which is , that with his own hand he slew -- yes , basely slew -- my mother . ''
Parsing [sent. 2450 len. 21]: The address of Francisco was here interrupted by a low deep groan of anguish , which startled the whole audience .
Parsing [sent. 2451 len. 22]: It was now quite dark , and the judge ordered the court to be lighted previous to the defence being continued .
Parsing [sent. 2452 len. 21]: The impatience and anxiety of those present were shown in low murmurs of communication until the lights were brought in .
Parsing [sent. 2453 len. 6]: The word `` Silence ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2454 len. 16]: from the judge produced an immediate obedience , and the prisoner was ordered to proceed .
Parsing [sent. 2455 len. 15]: Francisco then continued his address , commencing with the remembrances of his earliest childhood .
Parsing [sent. 2456 len. 34]: As he warmed with his subject , he became more eloquent ; his action became energetical without violence ; and the pallid and modest youth gradually grew into the impassioned and inspired orator .
Parsing [sent. 2457 len. 20]: He recapitulated rapidly , yet distinctly and with terrible force , all the startling events in his fearful life .
Parsing [sent. 2458 len. 28]: There was truth in the tones of his voice , there was conviction in his animated countenance , there was innocence in his open and expressive brow .
Parsing [sent. 2459 len. 28]: All who heard believed ; and scarcely had he concluded his address , when the jury appeared impatient to rise and give their verdict in his favour .
Parsing [sent. 2460 len. 47]: But the judge stood up , and , addressing the jury , told them that it was his most painful duty to remind them that as yet they had heard but assertion , beautiful and almost convincing assertion truly ; but still it was not proof .
Parsing [sent. 2461 len. 4]: `` Alas ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2462 len. 28]: observed Francisco , `` what evidence can I bring forward , except the evidence of those around me at the bar , which will not be admitted ?
Parsing [sent. 2463 len. 9]: Can I recall the dead from the grave ?
Parsing [sent. 2464 len. 16]: Can I expect those who have been murdered to rise again to assert my innocence ?
Parsing [sent. 2465 len. 18]: Can I expect that Don Cumanos will appear from distant leagues to give evidence on my behalf ?
Parsing [sent. 2466 len. 18]: Alas he knows not how I am situated , or he would have flown to my succour .
Parsing [sent. 2467 len. 41]: No , no ; not even can I expect that the sweet Spanish maiden , the last to whom I offered my protection , will appear in such a place as this to meet the bold gaze of hundreds ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2468 len. 6]: `` She is here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2469 len. 36]: replied a manly voice ; and a passage was made through the crowd ; and Clara , supported by Edward Templemore , dressed in his uniform , was ushered into the box for the witnesses .
Parsing [sent. 2470 len. 19]: The appearance of the fair girl , who looked round her with alarm , created a great sensation .
Parsing [sent. 2471 len. 37]: As soon as she was sufficiently composed , she was sworn , and gave her evidence as to Francisco 's behaviour during the time that she was a prisoner on board of the _ Avenger _ .
Parsing [sent. 2472 len. 21]: She produced the packet which had saved the life of Francisco , and substantiated a great part of his defence .
Parsing [sent. 2473 len. 33]: She extolled his kindness and his generosity ; and when she had concluded , every one asked of himself , `` Can this young man be a pirate and a murderer ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2474 len. 10]: The reply was , `` It is impossible . ''
Parsing [sent. 2475 len. 20]: `` My lord , '' said Edward Templemore , `` I request permission to ask the prisoner a question .
Parsing [sent. 2476 len. 23]: When I was on board of the wreck of the _ Avenger _ , I found this book floating in the cabin .
Parsing [sent. 2477 len. 22]: I wish to ask the prisoner , whether , as that young lady has informed me , it is his ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2478 len. 7]: And Edward Templemore produced the Bible .
Parsing [sent. 2479 len. 9]: `` It is mine , '' replied Francisco .
Parsing [sent. 2480 len. 15]: `` May I ask you by what means it came into your possession ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2481 len. 15]: `` It is the only relic left of one who is now no more .
Parsing [sent. 2482 len. 15]: It was the consolation of my murdered mother ; it has since been mine .
Parsing [sent. 2483 len. 19]: Give it to me , sir ; I may probably need its support now more than ever . ''
Parsing [sent. 2484 len. 10]: `` Was your mother murdered , say you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2485 len. 8]: cried Edward Templemore , with much agitation .
Parsing [sent. 2486 len. 14]: `` I have already said so ; and I now repeat it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2487 len. 13]: The judge again rose , and recapitulated the evidence to the jury .
Parsing [sent. 2488 len. 96]: Evidently friendly to Francisco he was obliged to point out to them , that although the evidence of the young lady had produced much which might be offered in extenuation , and induce him to submit it to His Majesty , in hopes of his gracious pardon after condemnation , yet , that many acts in which the prisoner had been involved had endangered his life and no testimony had been brought forward to prove that he had not , at one time , acted with the pirates , although he might since have repented .
Parsing [sent. 2489 len. 34]: They would of course , remember that the evidence of the mate , Hawkhurst , was not of any value , and must dismiss any impression which it might have made against Francisco .
Parsing [sent. 2490 len. 41]: At the same time he had the unpleasant duty to point out , that the evidence of the Spanish lady was so far prejudicial , that it pointed out the good terms subsisting between the young man and the pirate-captain .
Parsing [sent. 2491 len. 52]: Much as he was interested in his fate , he must reluctantly remind the jury , that the evidence on the whole was not sufficient to clear the prisoner ; and he considered it their duty to return a verdict of _ guilty against all the prisoners at the bar _ .
Parsing [sent. 2492 len. 49]: `` My lord , '' said Edward Templemore , a few seconds after the judge had resumed his seat ; `` may not the contents of this packet , the seal of which I have not ventured to break , afford some evidence in favour of the prisoner ?
Parsing [sent. 2493 len. 18]: Have you any objection that it should be opened previous to the jury delivering their verdict ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2494 len. 17]: `` None , '' replied the judge : `` but what are its supposed contents ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2495 len. 20]: `` The contents , my lord , '' replied Francisco , `` are in the writing of the pirate-captain .
Parsing [sent. 2496 len. 25]: He delivered that packet into my hands previous to our quitting the schooner , stating that it would inform me who were my parents .
Parsing [sent. 2497 len. 23]: My lord , in my present situation I claim that packet , and refuse that its contents should be read in court .
Parsing [sent. 2498 len. 38]: If I am to die an ignominious death , at least those who are connected with me shall not have to blush at my disgrace , for the secret of my parentage shall die with me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2499 len. 19]: `` Nay -- nay ; be ruled by me , '' replied Edward Templemore , with much emotion .
Parsing [sent. 2500 len. 44]: `` In the narrative , the handwriting of which can be proved by the king 's evidence , there may be acknowledgment of all you have stated , and it will be received as evidence ; will it not , my lord ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2501 len. 38]: `` If the handwriting is proved , I should think it may , '' replied the judge , `` particularly as the lady was present when the packet was delivered , and heard the captain 's assertion .
Parsing [sent. 2502 len. 14]: Will you allow it to be offered as evidence , young man ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2503 len. 21]: `` No , my lord , '' replied Francisco ; `` unless I have permission first to peruse it myself .
Parsing [sent. 2504 len. 17]: I will not have its contents divulged , unless I am sure of an honourable acquittal .
Parsing [sent. 2505 len. 8]: The jury must deliver their verdict . ''
Parsing [sent. 2506 len. 39]: The jury turned round to consult , during which Edward Templemore walked to Francisco , accompanied by Clara , to entreat him to allow the packet to be opened ; but Francisco was firm against both their entreaties .
Parsing [sent. 2507 len. 13]: At last the foreman of the jury rose to deliver the verdict .
Parsing [sent. 2508 len. 18]: A solemn and awful silence prevailed throughout the court ; the suspense was painful to a degree .
Parsing [sent. 2509 len. 24]: `` My lord , '' said the foreman of the jury , `` our verdict is -- '' `` Stop , sir ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2510 len. 21]: said Edward Templemore as he clasped one arm round the astonished Francisco , and extended the other towards the foreman .
Parsing [sent. 2511 len. 5]: `` Stop , sir !
Parsing [sent. 2512 len. 4]: harm him not !
Parsing [sent. 2513 len. 7]: for he is my brother ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2514 len. 6]: `` And my preserver ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2515 len. 19]: cried Clara , kneeling on the other side of Francisco , and holding up her hands in supplication .
Parsing [sent. 2516 len. 22]: The announcement was electrical ; the foreman dropped into his seat ; the judge and whole court were in mute astonishment .
Parsing [sent. 2517 len. 25]: The dead silence was followed by confusion , to which , after a time , the judge in vain attempted to put a stop .
Parsing [sent. 2518 len. 23]: Edward Templemore , Clara , and Francisco , continued to form the same group ; and never was there one more beautiful .
Parsing [sent. 2519 len. 21]: And now that they were together , every one in court perceived the strong resemblance between the two young men .
Parsing [sent. 2520 len. 31]: Francisco 's complexion was darker than Edward 's from his constant exposure , from infancy , to a tropical sun ; but the features of the two were the same .
Parsing [sent. 2521 len. 29]: It was some time before the judge could obtain silence in the court ; and when it had been obtained , he was himself puzzled how to proceed .
Parsing [sent. 2522 len. 18]: Edward and Francisco , who had exchanged a few words , were now standing side by side .
Parsing [sent. 2523 len. 21]: `` My lord , '' said Edward Templemore , `` the prisoner consents that the packet shall be opened . ''
Parsing [sent. 2524 len. 21]: `` I do , '' said Francisco , mournfully ; `` although I have but little hope from its contents .
Parsing [sent. 2525 len. 2]: Alas !
Parsing [sent. 2526 len. 25]: now that I have everything to live for -- not that I cling to life , I feel as if every chance was gone !
Parsing [sent. 2527 len. 27]: The days of miracles have passed ; and nothing but the miracle of the reappearance of the pirate-captain from the grave can prove my innocence . ''
Parsing [sent. 2528 len. 14]: `` He reappears from the grave to prove thine innocence , Francisco ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2529 len. 25]: said a deep , hollow voice , which startled the whole court , and most of all Hawkhurst and the prisoners at the bar .
Parsing [sent. 2530 len. 20]: Still more did fear and horror distort their countenances when into the witness-box stalked the giant form of Cain .
Parsing [sent. 2531 len. 34]: But it was no longer the figure which we have described in the commencement of this narrative ; his beard had been removed , and he was pale , wan , and emaciated .
Parsing [sent. 2532 len. 28]: His sunken eyes , his hollow cheek , and a short cough , which interrupted his speech , proved that his days were nearly at a close .
Parsing [sent. 2533 len. 29]: `` My lord , '' said Cain , addressing the judge , `` I am the pirate Cain , and was the captain of the _ Avenger _ !
Parsing [sent. 2534 len. 5]: Still am I free !
Parsing [sent. 2535 len. 16]: I come here voluntarily , that I may attest the innocence of that young man !
Parsing [sent. 2536 len. 17]: As yet , my hand has not known the manacle , nor my feet the gyves !
Parsing [sent. 2537 len. 20]: I am not a prisoner , nor included in the indictment , and at present my evidence is good .
Parsing [sent. 2538 len. 41]: None know me in this court , except those whose testimony , as prisoners , is unavailing ; and therefore , to save that boy , and only to save him , I demand that I may be sworn . ''
Parsing [sent. 2539 len. 11]: The oath was administered , with more than usual solemnity .
Parsing [sent. 2540 len. 39]: `` My lord , and gentlemen of the jury , I have been in court since the commencement of the trial , and I declare that every word which Francisco has uttered in his own defence is true .
Parsing [sent. 2541 len. 56]: He is totally innocent of any act of piracy or murder ; the packet would , indeed , have proved as much : but in that packet there are secrets which I wished to remain unknown to all but Francisco ; and , rather than it should be opened , I have come forward myself .
Parsing [sent. 2542 len. 29]: How that young officer discovered that Francisco is his brother I know not ; but if he also is the son of Cecilia Templemore , it is true .
Parsing [sent. 2543 len. 7]: But the packet will explain all .
Parsing [sent. 2544 len. 43]: `` And now , my lords , that my evidence is received , I am content : I have done one good deed before I die , and I surrender myself , as a pirate and a foul murderer , to justice .
Parsing [sent. 2545 len. 37]: True , my life is nearly closed -- thanks to that villain there ; but I prefer that I should meet that death I merit , as an expiation of my many deeds of guilt . ''
Parsing [sent. 2546 len. 44]: Cain then turned to Hawkhurst , who was close to him , but the mate appeared to be in a state of stupor ; he had not recovered from his first terror , and still imagined the appearance of Cain to be supernatural .
Parsing [sent. 2547 len. 4]: `` Villain ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2548 len. 17]: exclaimed Cain , putting his mouth close to Hawkhurst 's ear ; `` doubly damned villain !
Parsing [sent. 2549 len. 11]: thou ` lt die like a dog , and unrevenged !
Parsing [sent. 2550 len. 11]: The boy is safe , and I 'm alive ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2551 len. 7]: `` Art thou really living ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2552 len. 8]: said Hawkhurst , recovering from his fear .
Parsing [sent. 2553 len. 15]: `` Yes , living -- yes , flesh and blood ; feel , wretch !
Parsing [sent. 2554 len. 24]: feel this arm , and be convinced : thou hast felt the power of it before now , '' continued Cain , sarcastically .
Parsing [sent. 2555 len. 11]: `` And now , my lord , I have done .
Parsing [sent. 2556 len. 6]: Francisco , fare thee well !
Parsing [sent. 2557 len. 10]: I loved thee , and have proved my love .
Parsing [sent. 2558 len. 38]: Hate not , then , my memory , and forgive me -- yes , forgive me when I 'm no more , '' said Cain , who then turned his eyes to the ceiling of the court-house .
Parsing [sent. 2559 len. 10]: -- `` Yes , there she is , Francisco !
Parsing [sent. 2560 len. 5]: -- there she is !
Parsing [sent. 2561 len. 77]: and see , '' cried he , extending both arms above his head , `` she smiles upon -- yes , Francisco , your sainted mother smiles and pardons -- '' The sentence was not finished ; for Hawkhurst , when Cain 's arms were upheld , perceived his knife in his girdle , and , with the rapidity of thought , he drew it out , and passed it through the body of the pirate-captain .
Parsing [sent. 2562 len. 14]: Cain fell heavily on the floor while the court was again in confusion .
Parsing [sent. 2563 len. 11]: Hawkhurst was secured , and Cain raised from the ground .
Parsing [sent. 2564 len. 8]: `` I thank thee , Hawkhurst ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2565 len. 39]: said Cain , in an expiring voice ; `` another murder thou hast to answer for : and you have saved me from the disgrace , not of the gallows , but of the gallows in thy company .
Parsing [sent. 2566 len. 7]: Francisco , boy , farewell ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2567 len. 8]: and Cain groaned deeply , and expired .
Parsing [sent. 2568 len. 23]: Thus perished the renowned pirate-captain , who in his life had shed so much blood , and whose death produced another murder .
Parsing [sent. 2569 len. 6]: `` Blood for blood ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2570 len. 18]: The body was removed ; and it now remained but for the jury to give their verdict .
Parsing [sent. 2571 len. 36]: All the prisoners were found guilty , with the exception of Francisco , who left the dock accompanied by his newly-found brother , and the congratulations of every individual who could gain access to him .
Parsing [sent. 2572 len. 3]: CHAPTER EIGHTEEN .
Parsing [sent. 2573 len. 2]: CONCLUSION .
Parsing [sent. 2574 len. 48]: Our first object will be to explain to the reader by what means Edward Templemore was induced to surmise that in Francisco , whom he considered as a rival , he had found a brother ; and also to account for the reappearance of the pirate Cain .
Parsing [sent. 2575 len. 53]: In pursuance of his orders , Edward Templemore had proceeded on board of the wreck of the _ Avenger _ ; and while his men were employed in collecting articles of great value which were on board of her , he had descended into the cabin , which was partly under water .
Parsing [sent. 2576 len. 21]: He had picked up a book floating near the lockers , and on examination found it to be a Bible .
Parsing [sent. 2577 len. 44]: Surprised at seeing such a book on board of a pirate , he had taken it with him when he returned to the _ Enterprise _ , and had shown it to Clara , who immediately recognised it as the property of Francisco .
Parsing [sent. 2578 len. 33]: The book was saturated with the salt water , and as Edward mechanically turned over the pages , he referred to the title-page to see if there was any name upon it .
Parsing [sent. 2579 len. 31]: There was not : but he observed that the blank or fly-leaf next to the binding had been pasted down , and that there was writing on the other side .
Parsing [sent. 2580 len. 31]: In its present state it was easily detached from the cover ; and then , to his astonishment , he read the name of Cecilia Templemore -- his own mother .
Parsing [sent. 2581 len. 48]: He knew well the history ; how he had been saved , and his mother and brother supposed to be lost ; and it may readily be imagined how great was his anxiety to ascertain by what means her Bible had come into the possession of Francisco .
Parsing [sent. 2582 len. 96]: He dared not think Francisco was his brother -- that he was so closely connected with one he still supposed to be a pirate : but the circumstance was possible ; and although he had intended to have remained a few days longer , he now listened to the entreaties of Clara , whose peculiar position on board was only to be justified by the peculiar position from which she had been rescued , and returning that evening to the wreck he set fire to her , and then made all sail for Port Royal .
Parsing [sent. 2583 len. 62]: Fortunately he arrived , as we have stated , on the day of the trial ; and as soon as the signal was made by the admiral he immediately manned his gig , and , taking Clara with him , in case her evidence might be of use , arrived at the Court House when the trial was about half over .
Parsing [sent. 2584 len. 41]: In our last chapter but one , we stated that Cain had been wounded by Hawkhurst , when he was swimming on shore , and had sunk ; the ball had entered his chest , and passed through his lungs .
Parsing [sent. 2585 len. 86]: The contest between Hawkhurst and Francisco , and their capture by Edward , had taken place on the other side of the ridge of rocks in the adjacent cove , and although Francisco had seen Cain disappear , and concluded that he was dead , it was not so ; he had again risen above the water , and dropping his feet and finding bottom , he contrived to crawl out , and wade into a cave adjacent , where he lay down to die .
Parsing [sent. 2586 len. 70]: But in this cave there was one of the _ Avenger 's _ boats , two of the pirates mortally wounded , and the four Kroumen , who had concealed themselves there with the intention of taking no part in the conflict , and , as soon as it became dark , of making their escape in the boat , which they had hauled up dry into the cave .
Parsing [sent. 2587 len. 12]: Cain staggered in , recovered the dry land ; and fell .
Parsing [sent. 2588 len. 30]: Pompey , the Krouman , perceiving his condition , went to his assistance and bound up his wound , and the stanching of the blood soon revived the pirate-captain .
Parsing [sent. 2589 len. 6]: The other pirates died unaided .
Parsing [sent. 2590 len. 47]: Although the island was searched in every direction , this cave , from the water flowing into it , escaped the vigilance of the British seamen ; and when they re-embarked , with the majority of the pirates captured , Cain and the Kroumen were undiscovered .
Parsing [sent. 2591 len. 61]: As soon as it was dark , Cain informed them of his intentions ; and although the Kroumen would probably have left him to his fate , yet , as they required his services to know how to steer to some other island , he was assisted into the stern-sheets , and the boat was backed out of the cave .
Parsing [sent. 2592 len. 31]: By the direction of Cain they passed through the passage between the great island and the northern Caique , and before daylight were far away from any chance of capture .
Parsing [sent. 2593 len. 64]: Cain had now to a certain degree recovered , and knowing that they were in the channel of the small traders , he pointed out to the Kroumen that , if supposed to be pirates , they would inevitably be punished , although not guilty , and that they must pass off as the crew of a small coasting-vessel which had been wrecked .
Parsing [sent. 2594 len. 29]: He then , with the assistance of Pompey , cut off his beard as close as he could , and arranged his dress in a more European style .
Parsing [sent. 2595 len. 15]: They had neither water nor provisions , and were exposed to a vertical sun .
Parsing [sent. 2596 len. 27]: Fortunately for them , and still more fortunately for Francisco , on the second day they were picked up by an American brig bound to Antigua .
Parsing [sent. 2597 len. 44]: Cain narrated his fictitious disasters , but said nothing about his wound , the neglect of which would certainly have occasioned his death a very few days after he appeared at the trial , had he not fallen by the malignity of Hawkhurst .
Parsing [sent. 2598 len. 44]: Anxious to find his way to Port Royal , for he was indifferent as to his own life , and only wished to save Francisco , he was overjoyed to meet a small schooner trading between the islands , bound to Port Royal .
Parsing [sent. 2599 len. 39]: In that vessel he obtained a passage for himself and the Kroumen , and had arrived three days previous to the trial , and during that time had remained concealed until the day that the Admiralty Court assembled .
Parsing [sent. 2600 len. 59]: It may be as well here to remark , that Cain 's reason for not wishing the packet to be opened was , that among the other papers relative to Francisco were directions for the recovery of the treasure which he had concealed , and which , of course , he wished to be communicated to Francisco alone .
Parsing [sent. 2601 len. 42]: We will leave the reader to imagine what passed between Francisco and Edward after the discovery of their kindred , and proceed to state the contents of the packet , which the twin-brothers now opened in the presence of Clara alone .
Parsing [sent. 2602 len. 14]: We must , however , condense the matter , which was very voluminous .
Parsing [sent. 2603 len. 61]: It stated that Cain , whose real name was Charles Osborne , had sailed in a fine schooner from Bilboa , for the coast of Africa , to procure a cargo of slaves ; and had been out about twenty-four hours when the crew perceived a boat apparently with no one in her , about a mile ahead of them .
Parsing [sent. 2604 len. 14]: The water was then smooth , and the vessel had but little way .
Parsing [sent. 2605 len. 19]: As soon as they came up with the boat , they lowered down their skiff to examine her .
Parsing [sent. 2606 len. 14]: The men sent in the skiff soon returned , towing the boat alongside .
Parsing [sent. 2607 len. 45]: Lying at the bottom of the boat were found several men almost dead , and reduced to skeletons ; and in the stern-sheets a negro woman , with a child at her breast , and a white female in the last state of exhaustion .
Parsing [sent. 2608 len. 46]: Osborne was then a gay and unprincipled man , but not a hardened villain and murderer , as he afterwards became ; he had compassion and feeling -- they were all taken on board the schooner : some recovered , others were too much exhausted .
Parsing [sent. 2609 len. 45]: Among those restored was Cecilia Templemore and the infant , who at first had been considered quite dead ; but the negro woman , exhausted by the demands of her nursling and her privations , expired as she was being removed from the boat .
Parsing [sent. 2610 len. 41]: A goat , that fortunately was on board , proved a substitute for the negress ; and before Osborne had arrived off the coast , the child had recovered its health and vigour , and the mother her extreme beauty .
Parsing [sent. 2611 len. 12]: We must now pass over a considerable portion of the narrative .
Parsing [sent. 2612 len. 14]: Osborne was impetuous in his passions , and Cecilia Templemore became his victim .
Parsing [sent. 2613 len. 29]: He had , indeed , afterwards quieted her qualms of conscience by a pretended marriage , when he arrived at the Brazils with his cargo of human flesh .
Parsing [sent. 2614 len. 57]: But that was little alleviation of her sufferings ; she who had been indulged in every luxury , who had been educated with the greatest care , was now lost for ever , an outcast from the society to which she could never hope to return , and associating with those she both dreaded and despised .
Parsing [sent. 2615 len. 32]: She passed her days and her nights in tears ; and had soon more cause for sorrow from the brutal treatment she received from Osborne , who had been her destroyer .
Parsing [sent. 2616 len. 61]: Her child was her only solace ; but for him , and the fear of leaving him to the demoralising influence of those about him , she would have laid down and died : but she lived for him -- for him attempted to recall Osborne from his career of increasing guilt -- bore meekly with reproaches and with blows .
Parsing [sent. 2617 len. 28]: At last Osborne changed his nefarious life for one of deeper guilt : he became a pirate , and still carried with him Cecilia and her child .
Parsing [sent. 2618 len. 70]: This was the climax of her misery : she now wasted from day to day , and grief would soon have terminated her existence , had it not been hastened by the cruelty of Cain , who , upon an expostulation on her part , followed up with a denunciation of the consequences of his guilty career , struck her with such violence that she sank under the blow .
Parsing [sent. 2619 len. 40]: She expired with a prayer that her child might be rescued from a life of guilt ; and when the then repentant Cain promised what he never did perform , she blessed him , too , before she died .
Parsing [sent. 2620 len. 36]: Such was the substance of the narrative , as far as it related to the unfortunate mother of these two young men , who , when they had concluded , sat hand-in-hand in mournful silence .
Parsing [sent. 2621 len. 42]: This , however , was soon broken by the innumerable questions asked by Edward of his brother , as to what he could remember of their ill-fated parent , which were followed up by the history of Francisco 's eventful life .
Parsing [sent. 2622 len. 21]: `` And the treasure , Edward , '' said Francisco ; `` I can not take possession of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2623 len. 26]: `` No , nor shall you either , '' replied Edward ; `` it belongs to the captors , and must be shared as prize-money .
Parsing [sent. 2624 len. 24]: You will never touch one penny of it , but I shall , I trust , pocket a very fair proportion of it !
Parsing [sent. 2625 len. 14]: However , keep this paper , as it is addressed to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2626 len. 78]: The admiral had been made acquainted with all the particulars of the eventful trial , and had sent a message to Edward , requesting that , as soon as he and his brother could make it convenient , he would be happy to see them at the Penn , as well as the daughter of the Spanish governor , whom he must consider as being under his protection during the time that she remained at Port Royal .
Parsing [sent. 2627 len. 23]: This offer was gladly accepted by Clara ; and on the second day after the trial they proceeded up to the Penn. .
Parsing [sent. 2628 len. 16]: Clara and Francisco were introduced , and apartments and suitable attendance provided for the former .
Parsing [sent. 2629 len. 32]: `` Templemore , '' said the admiral , `` I 'm afraid I must send you away to Porto Rico , to assure the governor of his daughter 's safety . ''
Parsing [sent. 2630 len. 24]: `` I would rather you would send some one else , sir , and I 'll assure her happiness in the meantime . ''
Parsing [sent. 2631 len. 3]: `` What !
Parsing [sent. 2632 len. 4]: by marrying her ?
Parsing [sent. 2633 len. 2]: Humph !
Parsing [sent. 2634 len. 8]: you 've a good opinion of yourself !
Parsing [sent. 2635 len. 10]: Wait till you 're a captain , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 2636 len. 19]: `` I hope I shall not have to wait long , sir , '' replied Edward , demurely .
Parsing [sent. 2637 len. 24]: `` By-the-bye , '' said the admiral , `` did you not say you have notice of treasure concealed in those islands ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2638 len. 10]: `` My brother has : I have not . ''
Parsing [sent. 2639 len. 7]: `` We must send for it .
Parsing [sent. 2640 len. 9]: I think we must send you , Edward .
Parsing [sent. 2641 len. 10]: Mr Francisco , you must go with him . ''
Parsing [sent. 2642 len. 26]: `` With pleasure , sir , '' replied Francisco , laughing ; `` but I think I 'd rather wait till Edward is a captain .
Parsing [sent. 2643 len. 10]: His wife and his fortune ought to come together .
Parsing [sent. 2644 len. 17]: I think I shall not deliver up my papers until the day of his marriage ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2645 len. 48]: `` Upon my word , '' said Captain Manly , `` I wish , Templemore , you had your commission , for there seems so much depending on it -- the young lady 's happiness , my share of the prize-money , and the admiral 's eighth .
Parsing [sent. 2646 len. 19]: Really , admiral , it becomes a common cause ; and I 'm sure he deserves it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2647 len. 73]: `` So do I , Manly , '' replied the admiral ; `` and to prove that I have thought so here comes Mr Hadley with it in his hand ; it only wants one little thing to complete it -- '' `` Which is your signature , admiral , I presume , '' replied Captain Manly , taking a pen full of ink , and presenting it to his senior officer .
Parsing [sent. 2648 len. 26]: `` Exactly , '' replied the admiral , scribbling at the bottom of the paper ; `` and now -- it does not want that .
Parsing [sent. 2649 len. 9]: Captain Templemore , I wish you joy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2650 len. 15]: Edward made a very low obeisance , as his flushed countenance indicated his satisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 2651 len. 43]: `` I can not give commissions , admiral , '' said Francisco , presenting a paper in return ; `` but I can give information -- and you will find it not unimportant -- for the treasure appears of great value . ''
Parsing [sent. 2652 len. 6]: `` God bless my soul !
Parsing [sent. 2653 len. 9]: Manly , you must start at daylight ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2654 len. 15]: exclaimed the admiral ; `` why , there is enough to load your sloop !
Parsing [sent. 2655 len. 2]: There !
Parsing [sent. 2656 len. 4]: -- read it !
Parsing [sent. 2657 len. 22]: -- and then I will write your orders , and enclose a copy of it , for fear of accident . ''
Parsing [sent. 2658 len. 27]: `` That was to have been my fortune , '' said Francisco , with a grave smile ; `` but I would not touch it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2659 len. 6]: `` Very right , boy !
Parsing [sent. 2660 len. 5]: -- a fine principle !
Parsing [sent. 2661 len. 13]: But we are not quite so particular , '' said the admiral .
Parsing [sent. 2662 len. 9]: `` Now , where 's the young lady ?
Parsing [sent. 2663 len. 11]: Let her know that dinner 's on the table . ''
Parsing [sent. 2664 len. 54]: A fortnight after this conversation , Captain Manly returned with the treasure ; and the Enterprise , commanded by another officer , returned from Porto Rico , with a letter from the governor in reply to one from the admiral , in which the rescue of his daughter by Edward had been communicated .
Parsing [sent. 2665 len. 43]: The letter was full of thanks to the admiral , and compliments to Edward ; and , what was of more importance , it sanctioned the union of the young officer with his daughter , with a dozen boxes of gold doubloons .
Parsing [sent. 2666 len. 46]: About six weeks after the above-mentioned important conversation , Mr Witherington , who had been reading a voluminous packet of letters in his breakfast-room in Finsbury Square , pulled his bell so violently that old Jonathan thought his master must be out of his senses .
Parsing [sent. 2667 len. 31]: This , however , did not induce him to accelerate his solemn and measured pace ; and he made his appearance at the door , as usual , without speaking .
Parsing [sent. 2668 len. 11]: `` Why do n't that fellow answer the bell ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2669 len. 4]: cried Mr Witherington .
Parsing [sent. 2670 len. 13]: `` I am here , sir , '' said Jonathan , solemnly .
Parsing [sent. 2671 len. 7]: `` Well , so you are !
Parsing [sent. 2672 len. 5]: but , confound you !
Parsing [sent. 2673 len. 9]: you come like the ghost of a butler !
Parsing [sent. 2674 len. 13]: -- But who do you think is coming here , Jonathan ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2675 len. 9]: `` I can not tell , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 2676 len. 5]: `` But I can !
Parsing [sent. 2677 len. 5]: -- you solemn old !
Parsing [sent. 2678 len. 5]: Edward 's coming here !
Parsing [sent. 2679 len. 6]: -- coming home directly ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2680 len. 13]: `` Is he to sleep in his old room , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2681 len. 5]: replied the imperturbable butler .
Parsing [sent. 2682 len. 3]: `` No !
Parsing [sent. 2683 len. 4]: the best bedroom !
Parsing [sent. 2684 len. 18]: Why , Jonathan , he is married -- he is made a captain -- Captain Templemore ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2685 len. 6]: `` Yes -- sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 2686 len. 14]: `` And he has found his brother , Jonathan ; his twin-brother ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2687 len. 6]: `` Yes -- sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 2688 len. 12]: `` His brother Francis -- that was supposed to be lost !
Parsing [sent. 2689 len. 15]: But it 's a long story , Jonathan -- and a very wonderful one !
Parsing [sent. 2690 len. 9]: his poor mother has long been dead ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2691 len. 6]: `` In caelo quies ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2692 len. 8]: said Jonathan , casting up his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2693 len. 10]: `` But his brother has turned up again . ''
Parsing [sent. 2694 len. 4]: `` Resurgam ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2695 len. 4]: said the butler .
Parsing [sent. 2696 len. 18]: `` They will be here in ten days -- so let everything be in readiness , Jonathan .
Parsing [sent. 2697 len. 6]: God bless my soul ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2698 len. 14]: continued the old gentleman , `` I hardly know what I 'm about .
Parsing [sent. 2699 len. 9]: It 's a Spanish girl , Jonathan ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2700 len. 7]: `` What is , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2701 len. 6]: `` What is , sir !
Parsing [sent. 2702 len. 17]: -- who , Captain Templemore 's wife ; and he was tried as a pirate ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2703 len. 6]: `` Who , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2704 len. 4]: `` Who sir !
Parsing [sent. 2705 len. 7]: why , Francis , his brother !
Parsing [sent. 2706 len. 10]: Jonathan , you 're a stupid old fellow ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2707 len. 10]: `` Have you any further commands , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2708 len. 5]: `` No -- no !
Parsing [sent. 2709 len. 11]: -- there -- that 'll do -- go away . ''
Parsing [sent. 2710 len. 44]: And in three weeks after this conversation , Captain and Mrs Templemore , and his brother Frank , were established in the house , to the great delight of Mr Witherington ; for he had long been tired of solitude and old Jonathan .
Parsing [sent. 2711 len. 36]: The twin-brothers were a comfort to him in his old age : they closed his eyes in peace -- they divided his blessing and his large fortune and thus ends our history of THE PIRATE !
