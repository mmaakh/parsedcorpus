Parsing [sent. 1 len. 5]: THOMAS WINGFOLD , CURATE .
Parsing [sent. 2 len. 6]: By George MacDonald , LL.D .
Parsing [sent. 3 len. 4]: IN THREE VOLUMES .
Parsing [sent. 4 len. 7]: VOL I. THOMAS WINGFOLD , CURATE .
Parsing [sent. 5 len. 5]: CHAPTER I. HELEN LINGARD .
Parsing [sent. 6 len. 45]: A swift , gray November wind had taken every chimney of the house for an organ-pipe , and was roaring in them all at once , quelling the more distant and varied noises of the woods , which moaned and surged like a sea .
Parsing [sent. 7 len. 9]: Helen Lingard had not been out all day .
Parsing [sent. 8 len. 57]: The morning , indeed , had been fine , but she had been writing a long letter to her brother Leopold at Cambridge , and had put off her walk in the neighbouring park till after luncheon , and in the meantime the wind had risen , and brought with it a haze that threatened rain .
Parsing [sent. 9 len. 40]: She was in admirable health , had never had a day 's illness in her life , was hardly more afraid of getting wet than a young farmer , and enjoyed wind , especially when she was on horseback .
Parsing [sent. 10 len. 75]: Yet as she stood looking from her window , across a balcony where shivered more than one autumnal plant that ought to have been removed a week ago , out upon the old-fashioned garden and meadows beyond , where each lonely tree bowed with drifting garments -- I was going to say , like a suppliant , but it was AWAY from its storming enemy -- she did not feel inclined to go out .
Parsing [sent. 11 len. 33]: That she was healthy was no reason why she should be unimpressible , any more than that good temper should be a reason for indifference to the behaviour of one 's friend .
Parsing [sent. 12 len. 70]: She always felt happier in a new dress , when it was made to her mind and fitted her body ; and when the sun shone she was lighter-hearted than when it rained : I had written MERRIER , but Helen was seldom merry , and had she been made aware of the fact , and questioned why , would have answered -- Because she so seldom saw reason .
Parsing [sent. 13 len. 43]: She was what all her friends called a sensible girl ; but , as I say , that was no reason why she should be an insensible girl as well , and be subject to none of the influences of the weather .
Parsing [sent. 14 len. 68]: She did feel those influences , and therefore it was that she turned away from the window with the sense , rather than the conviction , that the fireside in her own room was rendered even , more attractive by the unfriendly aspect of things outside and the roar in the chimney , which happily was not accompanied by a change in the current of the smoke .
Parsing [sent. 15 len. 31]: The hours between luncheon and tea are confessedly dull , but dulness is not inimical to a certain kind of comfort , and Helen liked to be that way comfortable .
Parsing [sent. 16 len. 14]: Nor had she ever yet been aware of self-rebuke because of the liking .
Parsing [sent. 17 len. 22]: Let us see what kind and degree of comfort she had in the course of an hour and a half attained .
Parsing [sent. 18 len. 20]: And in discovering this I shall be able to present her to my reader with a little more circumstance .
Parsing [sent. 19 len. 11]: She sat before the fire in a rather masculine posture .
Parsing [sent. 20 len. 102]: I would not willingly be rude , but the fact remains -- a posture in which she would not , I think , have sat for her photograph -- leaning back in a chintz-covered easy-chair , all the lines of direction about her parallel with the lines of the chair , her arms lying on its arms , and the fingers of each hand folded down over the end of each arm -- square , straight , right-angled , -- gazing into the fire , with something of the look of a sage , but one who has made no discovery .
Parsing [sent. 21 len. 32]: She had just finished the novel of the day , and was suffering a mild reaction -- the milder , perhaps , that she was not altogether satisfied with the consummation .
Parsing [sent. 22 len. 29]: For the heroine had , after much sorrow and patient endurance , at length married a man whom she could not help knowing to be not worth having .
Parsing [sent. 23 len. 46]: For the author even knew it , only such was his reading of life , and such his theory of artistic duty , that what it was a disappointment to Helen to peruse , it seemed to have been a comfort to him to write .
Parsing [sent. 24 len. 47]: Indeed , her dissatisfaction went so far that , although the fire kept burning away in perfect content before her , enhanced by the bellowing complaint of the wind in the chimney , she yet came nearer thinking than she had ever been in her life .
Parsing [sent. 25 len. 35]: Now thinking , especially to one who tries it for the first time , is seldom , or never , a quite comfortable operation , and hence Helen was very near becoming actually uncomfortable .
Parsing [sent. 26 len. 74]: She was even on the borders of making the unpleasant discovery that the business of life -- and that not only for North Pole expeditions , African explorers , pyramid-inspectors , and such like , but for every man and woman born into the blindness of the planet -- is to discover ; after which discovery there is little more comfort to be had of the sort with which Helen was chiefly conversant .
Parsing [sent. 27 len. 22]: But she escaped for the time after a very simple and primitive fashion , although it was indeed a narrow escape .
Parsing [sent. 28 len. 38]: Let me not be misunderstood , however , and supposed to imply that Helen was dull in faculty , or that she contributed nothing to the bubbling of the intellectual pool in the social gatherings at Glaston .
Parsing [sent. 29 len. 4]: Far from it .
Parsing [sent. 30 len. 48]: When I say that she came near thinking , I say more for her than any but the few who know what thinking is will understand , for that which chiefly distinguishes man from those he calls the lower animals is the faculty he most rarely exercises .
Parsing [sent. 31 len. 42]: True , Helen supposed she could think -- like other people , because the thoughts of other people had passed through her in tolerable plenty , leaving many a phantom conclusion behind ; but this was THEIR thinking , not hers .
Parsing [sent. 32 len. 77]: She had thought no more than was necessary now and then to the persuasion that she saw what a sentence meant , after which , her acceptance or rejection of what was contained in it , never more than lukewarm , depended solely upon its relation to what she had somehow or other , she could seldom have told how , come to regard as the proper style of opinion to hold upon things in general .
Parsing [sent. 33 len. 128]: The social matrix which up to this time had ministered to her development , had some relations with Mayfair , it is true , but scanty ones indeed with the universe ; so that her present condition was like that of the common bees , every one of which Nature fits for a queen , but its nurses , prevent from growing one by providing for it a cell too narrow for the unrolling of royalty , and supplying it with food not potent enough for the nurture of the ideal -- with this difference , however , that the cramped and stinted thing comes out , if no queen , then a working bee , and Helen , who might be both , was neither yet .
Parsing [sent. 34 len. 51]: If I were at liberty to mention the books on her table , it would give a few of my readers no small help towards the settling of her position in the `` valued file '' of the young women of her generation ; but there are reasons against it .
Parsing [sent. 35 len. 76]: She was the daughter of an officer , who , her mother dying when she was born , committed her to the care of a widowed aunt , and almost immediately left for India , where he rose to high rank , and somehow or other amassed a considerable fortune , partly through his marriage with a Hindoo lady , by whom he had one child , a boy some three years younger than Helen .
Parsing [sent. 36 len. 15]: When he died , he left his fortune equally divided between the two children .
Parsing [sent. 37 len. 10]: Helen was now three-and-twenty , and her own mistress .
Parsing [sent. 38 len. 39]: Her appearance suggested Norwegian blood , for she was tall , blue-eyed , and dark-haired -- but fair-skinned , with regular features , and an over still-some who did not like her said hard -- expression of countenance .
Parsing [sent. 39 len. 32]: No one had ever called her NELLY ; yet she had long remained a girl , lingering on the broken borderland after several of her school companions had become young matrons .
Parsing [sent. 40 len. 23]: Her drawing-master , a man of some observation and insight , used to say Miss Lingard would wake up somewhere about forty .
Parsing [sent. 41 len. 25]: The cause of her so nearly touching the borders of thought this afternoon , was , that she became suddenly aware of feeling bored .
Parsing [sent. 42 len. 29]: Now Helen was even seldomer bored than merry , and this time she saw no reason for it , neither had any person to lay the blame upon .
Parsing [sent. 43 len. 18]: She might have said it was the weather , but the weather had never done it before .
Parsing [sent. 44 len. 17]: Nor could it be want of society , for George Bascombe was to dine with them .
Parsing [sent. 45 len. 13]: So was the curate , but he did not count for much .
Parsing [sent. 46 len. 7]: Neither was she weary of herself .
Parsing [sent. 47 len. 52]: That , indeed , might be only a question of time , for the most complete egotist , Julius Caesar , or Napoleon Bonaparte , must at length get weary of his paltry self ; but Helen , from the slow rate of her expansion , was not old enough yet .
Parsing [sent. 48 len. 44]: Nor was she in any special sense wrapt up in herself : it was only that she had never yet broken the shell which continues to shut in so many human chickens , long after they imagine themselves citizens of the real world .
Parsing [sent. 49 len. 79]: Being somewhat bored then , and dimly aware that to be bored was out of harmony with something or other , Helen was on the verge of thinking , but , as I have said , escaped the snare in a very direct and simple fashion : she went fast asleep , and never woke till her maid brought her the cup of kitchen-tea from which the inmates of some houses derive the strength to prepare for dinner .
Parsing [sent. 50 len. 3]: CHAPTER II .
Parsing [sent. 51 len. 3]: THOMAS WINGFOLD .
Parsing [sent. 52 len. 22]: The morning , whose afternoon was thus stormy , had been fine , and the curate went out for a walk .
Parsing [sent. 53 len. 17]: Had it been just as stormy , however , he would have gone all the same .
Parsing [sent. 54 len. 41]: Not that he was a great walker , or , indeed , fond of exercise of any sort , and his walking , as an Irishman might say , was half sitting -- on stiles and stones and fallen trees .
Parsing [sent. 55 len. 28]: He was not in bad health , he was not lazy , or given to self-preservation , but he had little impulse to activity of any sort .
Parsing [sent. 56 len. 16]: The springs in his well of life did not seem to flow quite fast enough .
Parsing [sent. 57 len. 70]: He strolled through Osterfield park , and down the deep descent to the river , where , chilly as it was , he seated himself upon a large stone on the bank , and knew that he was there , and that he had to answer to Thomas Wingfold ; but why he was there , and why he was not called something else , he did not know .
Parsing [sent. 58 len. 46]: On each side of the stream rose a steeply-sloping bank , on which grew many fern-bushes , now half withered , and the sunlight upon them , this November morning , seemed as cold as the wind that blew about their golden and green fronds .
Parsing [sent. 59 len. 50]: Over a rocky bottom the stream went -- talking rather than singing -- down the valley towards the town , where it seemed to linger a moment to embrace the old abbey church , before it set out on its leisurely slide through the low level to the sea .
Parsing [sent. 60 len. 43]: Its talk was chilly , and its ripples , which came half from the obstructions in its channel below , and half from the wind that ruffled it above , were not smiles , but wrinkles rather -- even in the sunshine .
Parsing [sent. 61 len. 24]: Thomas felt cold himself , but the cold was of the sort that comes from the look rather than the feel of things .
Parsing [sent. 62 len. 34]: He did not , however , much care how he felt -- not enough , certainly , to have made him put on a great-coat : he was not deeply interested in himself .
Parsing [sent. 63 len. 25]: With his stick , a very ordinary bit of oak , he kept knocking pebbles into the water , and listlessly watching them splash .
Parsing [sent. 64 len. 83]: The wind blew , the sun shone , the water ran , the ferns waved , the clouds went drifting over his head , but he never looked up , or took any notice of the doings of Mother Nature at her house-work : everything seemed to him to be doing only what it had got to do , because it had got it to do , and not because it cared about it , or had any end in doing it .
Parsing [sent. 65 len. 34]: For he , like every other man , could read nature only by his own lamp , and this was very much how he had hitherto responded to the demands made upon him .
Parsing [sent. 66 len. 19]: His life had not been a very interesting one , although early passages in it had been painful .
Parsing [sent. 67 len. 33]: He had done fairly well at Oxford : it had been expected of him , and he had answered expectation ; he had not distinguished himself , nor cared to do so .
Parsing [sent. 68 len. 57]: He had known from the first that he was intended for the church , and had not objected , but received it as his destiny -- had even , in dim obedience , kept before his mental vision the necessity of yielding to the heights and hollows of the mould into which he was being thrust .
Parsing [sent. 69 len. 11]: But he had taken no great interest in the matter .
Parsing [sent. 70 len. 27]: The church was to him an ancient institution of such approved respectability that it was able to communicate it , possessing emoluments , and requiring observances .
Parsing [sent. 71 len. 53]: He had entered her service ; she was his mistress , and in return for the narrow shelter , humble fare , and not quite too shabby garments she allotted him , he would perform her hests -- in the spirit of a servant who abideth not in the house for ever .
Parsing [sent. 72 len. 29]: He was now six and twenty years of age , and had never dreamed of marriage , or even been troubled with a thought of its unattainable remoteness .
Parsing [sent. 73 len. 38]: He did not philosophize much upon life or his position in it , taking everything with a cold , hopeless kind of acceptance , and laying no claim to courage , devotion , or even bare suffering .
Parsing [sent. 74 len. 51]: He had a certain dull prejudice in favour of honesty , would not have told the shadow of a lie to be made Archbishop of Canterbury , and yet was so uninstructed in the things that constitute practical honesty that some of his opinions would have considerably astonished St. Paul .
Parsing [sent. 75 len. 28]: He liked reading the prayers , for the making of them vocal in the church was pleasant to him , and he had a not unmusical voice .
Parsing [sent. 76 len. 46]: He visited the sick -- with some repugnance , it is true , but without delay , and spoke to them such religious commonplaces as occurred to him , depending mainly on the prayers belonging to their condition for the right performance of his office .
Parsing [sent. 77 len. 14]: He never thought about being a gentleman , but always behaved like one .
Parsing [sent. 78 len. 42]: I suspect that at this time there lay somewhere in his mind , keeping generally well out of sight however , that is , below the skin of his consciousness , the unacknowledged feeling that he had been hardly dealt with .
Parsing [sent. 79 len. 21]: But at no time , even when it rose plainest , would he have dared to add -- by Providence .
Parsing [sent. 80 len. 15]: Had the temptation come , he would have banished it and the feeling together .
Parsing [sent. 81 len. 44]: He did not read much , browsed over his newspaper at breakfast with a polite curiosity , sufficient to season the loneliness of his slice of fried bacon , and took more interest in some of the naval intelligence than in anything else .
Parsing [sent. 82 len. 20]: Indeed it would have been difficult for himself even to say in what he did take a large interest .
Parsing [sent. 83 len. 68]: When leisure awoke a question as to how he should employ it , he would generally take up his Horace and read aloud one of his more mournful odes -- with such attention to the rhythm , I must add , as , although plentiful enough among scholars in respect of the dead letter , is rarely found with them in respect of the living vocal utterance .
Parsing [sent. 84 len. 85]: Nor had he now sat long upon his stone , heedless of the world 's preparations for winter , before he began repeating to himself the poet 's Æquam memento rebus in arduis , which he had been trying much , but with small success , to reproduce in similar English cadences , moved thereto in part by the success of Tennyson in his O mighty-mouthed inventor of harmonies -- a thing as yet alone in the language , so far as I know .
Parsing [sent. 85 len. 97]: It was perhaps a little strange that the curate should draw the strength of which he was most conscious from the pages of a poet whose hereafter was chiefly servicable to him -- in virtue of its unsubstantiality and poverty , the dreamlike thinness of its reality -- in enhancing the pleasures of the world of sun and air , cooling shade and songful streams , the world of wine and jest , of forms that melted more slowly from encircling arms , and eyes that did not so swiftly fade and vanish in the distance .
Parsing [sent. 86 len. 70]: Yet when one reflects but for a moment on the poverty-stricken expectations of Christians from their hereafter , I cease to wonder at Wingfold ; for human sympathy is lovely and pleasant , and if a Christian priest and a pagan poet feel much in the same tone concerning the affairs of a universe , why should they not comfort each other by sitting down together in the dust ?
Parsing [sent. 87 len. 36]: `` No hair it boots thee whether from Inachus Ancient descended , or , of the poorest born , Thy being drags , all bare and roofless -- Victim the same to the heartless Orcus .
Parsing [sent. 88 len. 38]: All are on one road driven ; for each of us The urn is tossed , and , later or earlier , The lot will drop and all be sentenced Into the boat of eternal exile . ''
Parsing [sent. 89 len. 77]: Having thus far succeeded with these two stanzas , Wingfold rose , a little pleased with himself , and climbed the bank above him , wading through mingled sun and wind and ferns -- so careless of their shivering beauty and their coming exile , that a watcher might have said the prospect of one day leaving behind him the shows of this upper world could have no part in the curate 's sympathy with Horace .
Parsing [sent. 90 len. 3]: CHAPTER III .
Parsing [sent. 91 len. 3]: THE DINERS .
Parsing [sent. 92 len. 44]: Mrs. Ramshorn , Helen 's aunt , was past the middle age of woman ; had been handsome and pleasing , had long ceased to be either ; had but sparingly recognised the fact , yet had recognised it , and felt aggrieved .
Parsing [sent. 93 len. 26]: Hence in part it was that her mouth had gathered that peevish and wronged expression which tends to produce a moral nausea in the beholder .
Parsing [sent. 94 len. 50]: If she had but known how much uglier in the eyes of her fellow-mortals her own discontent made her , than the severest operation of the laws of mortal decay could have done , she might have tried to think less of her wrongs and more of her privileges .
Parsing [sent. 95 len. 26]: As it was , her own face wronged her own heart , which was still womanly , and capable of much pity -- seldom exercised .
Parsing [sent. 96 len. 28]: Her husband had been dean of Halystone , a man of insufficient weight of character to have the right influence in the formation of his wife 's .
Parsing [sent. 97 len. 13]: He had left her tolerably comfortable as to circumstances , but childless .
Parsing [sent. 98 len. 38]: She loved Helen , whose even imperturbability had by mere weight , as it might seem , gained such a power over her that she was really mistress in the house without either of them knowing it .
Parsing [sent. 99 len. 51]: Naturally desirous of keeping Helen 's fortune in the family , and having , as I say , no son of her own , she had yet not far to look to find a cousin capable , as she might well imagine , of rendering himself acceptable to the heiress .
Parsing [sent. 100 len. 28]: He was the son of her younger sister , married , like herself , to a dignitary of the Church , a canon of a northern cathedral .
Parsing [sent. 101 len. 53]: This youth , therefore , Greorge Bascombe by name , whose visible calling at present was to eat his way to the bar , she often invited to Glaston ; and on this Friday afternoon he was on his way from London to spend the Saturday and Sunday with the two ladies .
Parsing [sent. 102 len. 63]: The cousins liked each other , had not had more of each other 's society than was favourable to their aunt 's designs , who was far too prudent to have made as yet any reference to them , and stood altogether in as suitable a relative position for falling in love with each other as Mrs. Ramshorn could well have desired .
Parsing [sent. 103 len. 34]: Her chief , almost her only uneasiness , arose from the important and but too evident fact , that Helen Lingard was not a girl of the sort to fall readily in love .
Parsing [sent. 104 len. 53]: That , however , was of no consequence , provided it did not come in the way of marrying her cousin , who , her aunt felt confident , was better fitted to rouse her dormant affections than any other youth she had ever seen , or was ever likely to see .
Parsing [sent. 105 len. 64]: Upon this occasion she had asked Thomas Wingfold to meet him , partly with the design that he should act as a foil to her nephew , partly in order to do her duty by the church , to which she felt herself belong not as a lay member , but in some undefined professional capacity , in virtue of her departed dean .
Parsing [sent. 106 len. 27]: Wingfold had but lately come to the parish , and , as he was merely curate , she had not been in haste to invite him .
Parsing [sent. 107 len. 31]: On the other hand , he was the only clergyman officiating in the abbey church , which was grand and old , with a miserable living and a non-resident rector .
Parsing [sent. 108 len. 51]: He , to do him justice , paid nearly the amount of the tithes in salary to his curate , and spent the rest on the church material , of which , for certain reasons , he retained the incumbency , the presentation to which belonged to his own family .
Parsing [sent. 109 len. 44]: The curate presented himself at the dinner-hour in Mrs. Ramshorn 's drawing-room , looking like any other gentleman , satisfied with his share in the administration of things , and affecting nothing of the professional either in dress , manner , or tone .
Parsing [sent. 110 len. 89]: Helen saw him for the first time in private life , and , as she had expected , saw nothing remarkable -- a man who looked about thirty , was a little over the middle height , and well enough constructed as men go , had a good forehead , a questionable nose , clear grey eyes , long , mobile , sensitive mouth , large chin , pale complexion , and straight black hair , and might have been a lawyer just as well as a clergyman .
Parsing [sent. 111 len. 81]: A keener , that is , a more interested eye than hers , might have discovered traces of suffering in the forms of the wrinkles which , as he talked , would now and then flit like ripples over his forehead ; but Helen 's eyes seldom did more than slip over the faces presented to her ; and had it been otherwise , who could be expected to pay much regard to Thomas Wingfold when George Bascombe was present ?
Parsing [sent. 112 len. 14]: There , indeed , stood a man by the corner of the mantelpiece !
Parsing [sent. 113 len. 54]: -- tall and handsome as an Apollo , and strong as the young Hercules , dressed in the top of the plainest fashion , self-satisfied , but not offensively so , good-natured , ready to smile , as clean in conscience , apparently , and as large in sympathy , as his shirt-front .
Parsing [sent. 114 len. 27]: Everybody who knew him , counted George Bascombe a genuine good fellow , and George himself knew little to the contrary , while Helen knew nothing .
Parsing [sent. 115 len. 34]: One who had only chanced to get a glimpse of her in her own room , as in imagination my reader has done , would hardly have recognised her again in the drawing-room .
Parsing [sent. 116 len. 43]: For in her own room she was but as she appeared to herself in her mirror -- dull , inanimate ; but in the drawing-room her reflection from living eyes and presences served to stir up what waking life was in her .
Parsing [sent. 117 len. 85]: When she spoke , her face dawned with a clear , although not warm light ; and although it must be owned that when it was at rest , the same over-stillness , amounting almost to dulness , the same seeming immobility , ruled as before , yet , even when she was not speaking , the rest was often broken by a smile -- a genuine one , for although there was much that was stiff , there was nothing artificial about Helen .
Parsing [sent. 118 len. 51]: Neither was there much of the artificial about her cousin ; for his good-nature , and his smile , and whatever else appeared upon him , were all genuine enough -- the only thing in this respect not quite satisfactory to the morally fastidious man being his tone in speaking .
Parsing [sent. 119 len. 52]: Whether he had caught it at the university , or amongst his father 's clerical friends , or in the professional society he now frequented , I can not tell , but it had been manufactured somewhere -- after a large , scrolly kind of pattern , sounding well-bred and dignified .
Parsing [sent. 120 len. 14]: I wonder how many speak with the voices that really belong to them .
Parsing [sent. 121 len. 39]: Plainly , to judge from the one Bascombe used , he was accustomed to lay down the law , but in gentlemanly fashion , and not as if he cared a bit about the thing in question himself .
Parsing [sent. 122 len. 31]: By the side of his easy carriage , his broad chest , and towering Greek-shaped head , Thomas Wingfold dwindled almost to vanishing -- in a word , looked nobody .
Parsing [sent. 123 len. 45]: And besides his inferiority in size and self-presentment , he had a slight hesitation of manner , which seemed to anticipate , if not to court , the subordinate position which most men , and most women too , were ready to assign him .
Parsing [sent. 124 len. 10]: He said , `` Do n't you think ? ''
Parsing [sent. 125 len. 93]: far oftener than `` I think '' and was always more ready to fix his attention upon the strong points of an opponent 's argument than to re-assert his own in slightly altered phrase like most men , or even in fresh forms like a few ; hence -- self-assertion , either modestly worn like a shirt of fine chain-armour , or gaunt and obtrusive like plates of steel , being the strength of the ordinary man -- what could the curate appear but defenceless , therefore weak , and therefore contemptible ?
Parsing [sent. 126 len. 37]: The truth is , he had less self-conceit than a mortal 's usual share , and was not yet possessed of any opinions interesting enough to himself to seem worth defending with any approach to vivacity .
Parsing [sent. 127 len. 84]: Bascombe and he bowed in response to their introduction with proper indifference , after a moment 's solemn pause exchanged a sentence or two which resembled an exercise in the proper use of a foreign language , and then gave what attention Englishmen are capable of before dinner to the two ladies -- the elder of whom , I may just mention , was dressed in black velvet with heavy Venetian lace , and the younger in black silk , with old Honiton .
Parsing [sent. 128 len. 10]: Neither of them did much towards enlivening the conversation .
Parsing [sent. 129 len. 58]: Mrs. Ramshorn , whose dinner had as yet gained in interest with her years , sat peevishly longing for its arrival , but cast every now and then a look of mild satisfaction upon her nephew , which , however , while it made her eyes sweeter , did not much alter the expression of her mouth .
Parsing [sent. 130 len. 22]: Helen improved , as she fancied , the arrangement of a few green-house flowers in an ugly vase on the table .
Parsing [sent. 131 len. 60]: At length the butler appeared , the curate took Mrs. Ramshorn , and the cousins followed -- making , in the judgment of the butler as he stood in the hall , and the housekeeper as she peeped from the baise-covered door that led to the still-room , as handsome a couple as mortal eyes need wish to see .
Parsing [sent. 132 len. 30]: They looked nearly of an age , the lady the more stately , the gentleman the more graceful , or , perhaps rather , ELEGANT , of the two .
Parsing [sent. 133 len. 3]: CHAPTER IV .
Parsing [sent. 134 len. 3]: THEIR TALK .
Parsing [sent. 135 len. 53]: During dinner , Bascombe had the talk mostly to himself , and rattled well , occasionally rebuked by his aunt for some remark which might to a clergyman appear objectionable ; nor as a partisan was she altogether satisfied with the curate that he did not seem inclined to take clerical exception .
Parsing [sent. 136 len. 41]: He ate his dinner , quietly responding to Bascombe 's sallies -- which had usually more of vivacity than keenness , more of good spirits than wit -- with a curious flickering smile , or a single word of agreement .
Parsing [sent. 137 len. 28]: It might have seemed that he was humouring a younger man , but the truth was , the curate had not yet seen cause for opposing him .
Parsing [sent. 138 len. 54]: How any friend could have come to send Helen poetry I can not imagine , but that very morning she had received by post a small volume of verse , which , although just out , and by an unknown author , had already been talked of in what are called literary circles .
Parsing [sent. 139 len. 28]: Wingfold had read some extracts from the book that same morning , and was therefore not quite unprepared when Helen asked him if he had seen it .
Parsing [sent. 140 len. 25]: He suggested that the poems , if the few lines he had seen made a fair sample , were rather of the wailful order .
Parsing [sent. 141 len. 79]: `` If there is one thing I despise more than another , '' said Bascombe , `` it is to hear a man , a fellow with legs and arms , pour out his griefs into the bosom of that most discreet of confidantes , Society , bewailing his hard fate , and calling upon youths and maidens to fill their watering-pots with tears , and with him water the sorrowful pansies and undying rue of the race .
Parsing [sent. 142 len. 7]: I believe I am quoting . ''
Parsing [sent. 143 len. 13]: `` I think you must be , George , '' said Helen .
Parsing [sent. 144 len. 15]: `` I never knew you venture so near the edge of poetry before . ''
Parsing [sent. 145 len. 15]: `` Ah , that is all you know of me , Miss Lingard ! ''
Parsing [sent. 146 len. 4]: returned Bascombe . ''
Parsing [sent. 147 len. 21]: -- And then , '' he resumed , turning again to Wingfold , `` what is it they complain of ?
Parsing [sent. 148 len. 23]: That some girls preferred a better man perhaps , or that a penny paper once told the truth of their poetry . ''
Parsing [sent. 149 len. 19]: `` Or it may be only that it is their humour to be sad , '' said Wingfold .
Parsing [sent. 150 len. 23]: `` But do n't you think , '' he continued , `` it is hardly worth while to be indignant with them ?
Parsing [sent. 151 len. 15]: Their verses are a relief to them , and do nobody any harm . ''
Parsing [sent. 152 len. 36]: `` They do all the boys and girls harm that read them , and themselves who write them more harm than anybody , confirming them in tearful habits , and teaching eyes unused to weep .
Parsing [sent. 153 len. 14]: I quote again , I believe , but from whom I am innocent .
Parsing [sent. 154 len. 22]: If I ever had a grief , I should have along with it the decency to keep it to myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 155 len. 23]: `` I do n't doubt you would , George , '' said his cousin , who seemed more playfully inclined than usual .
Parsing [sent. 156 len. 22]: `` But , '' she added , with a smile , `` would your silence be voluntary , or enforced ? ''
Parsing [sent. 157 len. 4]: `` What ! ''
Parsing [sent. 158 len. 16]: returned Bascombe , `` you think I could not plain my woes to the moon ?
Parsing [sent. 159 len. 8]: Why not I as well as another ?
Parsing [sent. 160 len. 11]: I could roar you as ` twere any nightingale . ''
Parsing [sent. 161 len. 12]: `` You have had your sorrows , then , George ? ''
Parsing [sent. 162 len. 24]: `` Never anything worse yet than a tailor 's bill , Helen , and I hope you wo n't provide me with any .
Parsing [sent. 163 len. 8]: I am not in love with decay .
Parsing [sent. 164 len. 47]: I remember a fellow at Trinity , the merriest of all our set at a wine-party , who , alone with his ink-pot , was for ever enacting the part of the unheeded poet , complaining of the hard hearts and tuneless ears of his generation .
Parsing [sent. 165 len. 73]: I went into his room once , and found him with the tears running down his face , a pot of stout half empty on the table , and his den all but opaque with tobacco-smoke , reciting , with sobs -- I had repeated the lines so often before they ceased to amuse me , that I can never forget them -- ` Heard ` st thou a quiver and clang ?
Parsing [sent. 166 len. 9]: In thy sleep did it make thee start ?
Parsing [sent. 167 len. 17]: 'T was a chord in twain that sprang -- But the lyre-shell was my heart . '
Parsing [sent. 168 len. 22]: He took a pull at the stout , laid his head on the table , and sobbed like a locomotive . ''
Parsing [sent. 169 len. 44]: `` But it 's not very bad -- not bad at all , so far as I see , '' said Helen , who had a woman 's weakness for the side attacked , in addition to a human partiality for fair play .
Parsing [sent. 170 len. 16]: `` No , not bad at all -- for absolute nonsense , '' said Bascombe .
Parsing [sent. 171 len. 11]: `` He had been reading Heine , '' said Wingfold .
Parsing [sent. 172 len. 9]: `` And burlesquing him , '' returned Bascombe .
Parsing [sent. 173 len. 24]: `` Fancy hearing one of the fellow 's heart-strings crack , and taking it for a string of his fiddle in the press !
Parsing [sent. 174 len. 9]: By the way , what are the heart-strings ?
Parsing [sent. 175 len. 6]: Have they any anatomical synonym ?
Parsing [sent. 176 len. 11]: But I have no doubt it was good poetry . ''
Parsing [sent. 177 len. 15]: `` Do you think poetry and common sense necessarily opposed to each other ? ''
Parsing [sent. 178 len. 3]: asked Wingfold .
Parsing [sent. 179 len. 18]: `` I confess a leaning to that opinion , '' replied Bascombe , with a half-conscious smile .
Parsing [sent. 180 len. 11]: `` What do you say of Horace , now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 181 len. 3]: suggested Wingfold .
Parsing [sent. 182 len. 18]: `` Unfortunately for me , you have mentioned the one poet for whom I have any respect .
Parsing [sent. 183 len. 12]: But what I like in him is just his common sense .
Parsing [sent. 184 len. 17]: He never cries over spilt milk , even if the jug be broken to the bargain .
Parsing [sent. 185 len. 15]: But common sense would be just as good in prose as in verse . ''
Parsing [sent. 186 len. 27]: `` Possibly ; but what we have of it in Horace would never have reached us but for the forms into which he has cast it .
Parsing [sent. 187 len. 10]: How much more enticing acorns in the cup are !
Parsing [sent. 188 len. 11]: I was watching two children picking them up to-day . ''
Parsing [sent. 189 len. 19]: `` That may be ; there have always been more children than grown men , '' returned Bascombe .
Parsing [sent. 190 len. 22]: `` For my part , I would sweep away all illusions , and get at the heart of the affair . ''
Parsing [sent. 191 len. 40]: `` But , '' said Wingfold , with the look of one who , as he tries to say it , is seeing a thing for the first time , `` does not the acorn-cup belong to the acorn ?
Parsing [sent. 192 len. 24]: May not some of what you call illusions , be the finer , or at least more ethereal qualities of the thing itself ?
Parsing [sent. 193 len. 13]: You do not object to music in church , for instance ? ''
Parsing [sent. 194 len. 69]: Bascombe was on the point of saying he objected to it nowhere except in church , but for his aunt 's sake , or rather for his own sake in his aunt 's eyes , he restrained himself , and uttered his feelings only in a peculiar smile , of import so mingled , that its meaning was illegible ere it had quivered along his lip and vanished .
Parsing [sent. 195 len. 19]: `` I am no metaphysician , '' he said , and Wingfold accepted the dismissal of the subject .
Parsing [sent. 196 len. 34]: Little passed between the two men over their wine ; and as neither of them cared to drink more than a couple of glasses , they soon rejoined the ladies in the drawing-room .
Parsing [sent. 197 len. 20]: Mrs. Ramshorn was taking her usual forty winks in her arm-chair , and their entrance did not disturb her .
Parsing [sent. 198 len. 7]: Helen was turning over some music .
Parsing [sent. 199 len. 16]: `` I am looking for a song for you , George , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 200 len. 24]: `` I want Mr. Wingfold to hear you sing , lest he should take you for a man of stone and lime . ''
Parsing [sent. 201 len. 10]: `` Never mind looking , '' returned her cousin .
Parsing [sent. 202 len. 11]: `` I will sing one you have never heard . ''
Parsing [sent. 203 len. 13]: And seating himself at the piano , he sang the following verses .
Parsing [sent. 204 len. 23]: They were his own , a fact he would probably have allowed to creep out , had they met with more sympathy .
Parsing [sent. 205 len. 12]: His voice was a full bass one , full of tone .
Parsing [sent. 206 len. 64]: `` Each man has his lampful , his lampful of oil ; He may dull its glimmer with sorrow and toil ; He may leave it unlit , and let it dry , Or wave it aloft , and hold it high : For mine , it shall burn with a fearless flame In the front of the darkness that has no name .
Parsing [sent. 207 len. 5]: `` Sunshine and Wind ?
Parsing [sent. 208 len. 5]: -- are ye there ?
Parsing [sent. 209 len. 2]: Ho !
Parsing [sent. 210 len. 2]: ho !
Parsing [sent. 211 len. 12]: Are ye comrades or lords , as ye shine and blow ?
Parsing [sent. 212 len. 6]: I care not , I !
Parsing [sent. 213 len. 15]: I will lift my head Till ye shine and blow on my grassy bed .
Parsing [sent. 214 len. 10]: See , brother Sun , I am shining too !
Parsing [sent. 215 len. 10]: Wind , I am living as well as you !
Parsing [sent. 216 len. 27]: `` Though the sun go out like a vagrant spark , And his daughter planets are left in the dark , I care not , I !
Parsing [sent. 217 len. 6]: For why should I care ?
Parsing [sent. 218 len. 10]: I shall be hurtless , nor here nor there .
Parsing [sent. 219 len. 22]: Sun and Wind , let us shine and shout , For the day draws nigh when we all go out ! ''
Parsing [sent. 220 len. 18]: `` I do n't like the song , '' said Helen , wrinkling her brows a little .
Parsing [sent. 221 len. 9]: `` It sounds -- well , heathenish . ''
Parsing [sent. 222 len. 31]: She would , I fear , have said nothing of the sort , being used to that kind of sound from her cousin , had not a clergyman been present .
Parsing [sent. 223 len. 28]: Yet she said it from no hypocrisy , but simple regard to his professional feelings , `` I sung it for Mr. Wingfold , '' returned Bascombe .
Parsing [sent. 224 len. 14]: `` It would have been a song after Horace 's own heart . ''
Parsing [sent. 225 len. 25]: `` Do n't you think , '' rejoined the curate , `` the defiant tone of your song would have been strange to him ?
Parsing [sent. 226 len. 19]: I confess that what I find chiefly attractive in Horace is his sad submission to the inevitable . ''
Parsing [sent. 227 len. 4]: `` Sad ? ''
Parsing [sent. 228 len. 3]: echoed Bascombe .
Parsing [sent. 229 len. 8]: `` Do n't you think so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 230 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 231 len. 15]: He makes the best of it , and as merrily as he can . ''
Parsing [sent. 232 len. 13]: `` AS HE CAN , I grant you , '' said Wingfold .
Parsing [sent. 233 len. 32]: Here Mrs. Ramshorn woke , and the subject was dropped , leaving Mr. Wingfold in some perplexity as to this young man and his talk , and what the phenomenon signified .
Parsing [sent. 234 len. 16]: Was heathenism after all secretly cherished , and about to become fashionable in English society ?
Parsing [sent. 235 len. 17]: He saw little of its phases , and for what he knew it might be so .
Parsing [sent. 236 len. 7]: Helen sat down to the piano .
Parsing [sent. 237 len. 12]: Her time was perfect , and she never blundered a note .
Parsing [sent. 238 len. 20]: She played well and woodenly , and had for her reward a certain wooden satisfaction in her own performance .
Parsing [sent. 239 len. 31]: The music she chose was good of its kind , but had more to do with the instrument than the feelings , and was more dependent upon execution than expression .
Parsing [sent. 240 len. 34]: Bascombe yawned behind his handkerchief , and Wingfold gazed at the profile of the player , wondering how , with such fine features and complexion , with such a fine-shaped and well-set head ?
Parsing [sent. 241 len. 10]: her face should be so far short of interesting .
Parsing [sent. 242 len. 9]: It seemed a face that had no story .
Parsing [sent. 243 len. 3]: CHAPTER V .
Parsing [sent. 244 len. 4]: A STAGGERING QUESTION .
Parsing [sent. 245 len. 10]: It was time the curate should take his leave .
Parsing [sent. 246 len. 12]: Bascombe would go out with him and have his last cigar .
Parsing [sent. 247 len. 11]: The wind had fallen , and the moon was shining .
Parsing [sent. 248 len. 37]: A vague sense of contrast came over Wingfold , and as he stepped on the pavement from the threshold of the high gates of wrought iron , he turned involuntarily and looked back at the house .
Parsing [sent. 249 len. 42]: It was of red brick , and flat-faced in the style of Queen Anne 's time , so that the light could do nothing with it in the way of shadow , and dwelt only on the dignity of its unpretentiousness .
Parsing [sent. 250 len. 41]: But aloft over its ridge the moon floated in the softest , loveliest blue , with just a cloud here and there to show how blue it was , and a sparkle where its blueness took fire in a star .
Parsing [sent. 251 len. 48]: It was autumn , almost winter , below , and the creepers that clung to the house waved in the now gentle wind like the straggling tresses of old age ; but above was a sky that might have overhung the last melting of spring into summer .
Parsing [sent. 252 len. 22]: At the end of the street rose the great square tower of the church , seeming larger than in the daylight .
Parsing [sent. 253 len. 35]: There was something in it all that made the curate feel there ought to be more -- as if the night knew something he did not ; and he yielded himself to its invasion .
Parsing [sent. 254 len. 35]: His companion having carefully lighted his cigar all round its extreme periphery , took it from his mouth , regarded its glowing end with a smile of satisfaction , and burst into a laugh .
Parsing [sent. 255 len. 25]: It was not a scornful laugh , neither was it a merry or a humorous laugh ; it was one of satisfaction and amusement .
Parsing [sent. 256 len. 15]: `` Let me have a share in the fun , '' said the curate .
Parsing [sent. 257 len. 28]: `` You have it , '' said his companion -- rudely , indeed , but not quite offensively , and put his cigar in his mouth again .
Parsing [sent. 258 len. 9]: Wingfold was not one to take umbrage easily .
Parsing [sent. 259 len. 21]: He was not important enough in his own eyes for that , but he did not choose to go farther .
Parsing [sent. 260 len. 30]: `` That 's a fine old church , '' he said , pointing to the dark mass invading the blue -- so solid , yet so clear in outline .
Parsing [sent. 261 len. 18]: `` I am glad the mason-work is to your mind , '' returned Bascombe , almost compassionately .
Parsing [sent. 262 len. 13]: `` It must be some satisfaction , perhaps consolation to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 263 len. 16]: Before he had thus concluded the sentence a little scorn had crept into his tone .
Parsing [sent. 264 len. 17]: `` You make some allusion which I do not quite apprehend , '' said the curate .
Parsing [sent. 265 len. 35]: `` Now , I am going to be honest with you , '' said Bascombe abruptly , and stopping , he turned towards his companion , and took the full-flavoured Havannah from his lips .
Parsing [sent. 266 len. 29]: `` I like you , '' he went on , `` for you seem reasonable ; and besides , a man ought to speak out what he thinks .
Parsing [sent. 267 len. 4]: So here goes !
Parsing [sent. 268 len. 15]: -- Tell me honestly -- do you believe one word of all that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 269 len. 14]: And he in his turn pointed in the direction of the great tower .
Parsing [sent. 270 len. 25]: The curate was taken by surprise and made no answer : it was as if he had received a sudden blow in the face .
Parsing [sent. 271 len. 17]: Recovering himself presently , however , he sought room to pass the question without direct encounter .
Parsing [sent. 272 len. 8]: `` How came the thing there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 273 len. 9]: he said , once more indicating the church-tower .
Parsing [sent. 274 len. 34]: `` By faith , no doubt , '' answered Bascombe , laughing , -- `` but not your faith ; no , nor the faith of any of the last few generations . ''
Parsing [sent. 275 len. 22]: `` There are more churches built now , ten times over , than in any former period of our history . ''
Parsing [sent. 276 len. 8]: `` True ; but of what sort ?
Parsing [sent. 277 len. 11]: All imitation -- never an original amongst them all ! ''
Parsing [sent. 278 len. 15]: `` If they had found out the right way , why change it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 279 len. 3]: `` Good !
Parsing [sent. 280 len. 35]: But it is rather ominous for the claim of a divine origin to your religion that it should be the only one thing that in these days takes the crab 's move -- backwards .
Parsing [sent. 281 len. 19]: You are indebted to your forefathers for your would-be belief , as well as for their genuine churches .
Parsing [sent. 282 len. 8]: You hardly know what your belief is .
Parsing [sent. 283 len. 19]: There is my aunt -- as good a specimen as I know of what you call a Christian !
Parsing [sent. 284 len. 55]: -- so accustomed is she to think and speak too after the forms of what you heard my cousin call heathenism , that she would never have discovered , had she been as wide awake as she was sound asleep , that the song I sung was anything but a good Christian ballad . ''
Parsing [sent. 285 len. 12]: `` Pardon me ; I think you are wrong there . ''
Parsing [sent. 286 len. 3]: `` What !
Parsing [sent. 287 len. 53]: did you never remark how these Christian people , who profess to believe that their great man has conquered death , and all that rubbish -- did you never observe the way they look if the least allusion is made to death , or the eternity they say they expect beyond it ?
Parsing [sent. 288 len. 14]: Do they not stare as if you had committed a breach of manners ?
Parsing [sent. 289 len. 22]: Religion itself is the same way : as much as you like about the church , but do n't mention Christ !
Parsing [sent. 290 len. 44]: At the same time , to do them justice , it is only of death in the abstract they decline to hear ; they will listen to the news of the death of a great and good man , without any such emotion .
Parsing [sent. 291 len. 17]: Look at the poetry of death -- I mean the way Christian poets write of it !
Parsing [sent. 292 len. 16]: A dreamless sleep they call it -- the bourne from whence , knows no waking .
Parsing [sent. 293 len. 8]: ` She is gone for ever ! '
Parsing [sent. 294 len. 7]: cries the mother over her daughter .
Parsing [sent. 295 len. 34]: And that is why such things are not to be mentioned , because in their hearts they have no hope , and in their minds no courage to face the facts of existence .
Parsing [sent. 296 len. 55]: We have n't the pluck of the old fellows , who , that they might look death himself in the face without dismay , accustomed themselves , even at their banquets , to the sight of his most loathsome handiwork , his most significant symbol -- and enjoyed their wine the better for it !
Parsing [sent. 297 len. 9]: -- your friend Horace , for instance . ''
Parsing [sent. 298 len. 16]: `` But your aunt now would never consent to such an interpretation of her opinions .
Parsing [sent. 299 len. 10]: Nor do I allow that it is fair . ''
Parsing [sent. 300 len. 30]: `` My dear sir , if there is one thing I pride myself upon , it is fair play , and I grant you at once she would not .
Parsing [sent. 301 len. 13]: But I am speaking , not of creeds , but of beliefs .
Parsing [sent. 302 len. 30]: And I assert that the forms of common Christian speech regarding death come nearer those of Horace than your saint , the old Jew , Saul of Tarsus . ''
Parsing [sent. 303 len. 49]: It did not occur to Wingfold that people generally speak from the surfaces , not the depths of their minds , even when those depths are moved ; nor yet that possibly Mrs. Ramshorn was not the best type of a Christian , even in his soft-walking congregation !
Parsing [sent. 304 len. 31]: In fact , nothing came into his mind with which to meet what Bascombe said -- the real force whereof he could not help feeling -- and he answered nothing .
Parsing [sent. 305 len. 10]: His companion followed his apparent yielding with fresh pressure .
Parsing [sent. 306 len. 28]: `` In truth , '' he said , `` I do not believe that YOU believe more than an atom here and there of what you profess .
Parsing [sent. 307 len. 14]: I am confident you have more good sense by a great deal . ''
Parsing [sent. 308 len. 56]: `` I am sorry to find that you place good sense above good faith , Mr. Bascombe ; but I am obliged by your good opinion , which , as I read it , amounts to this -- that I am one of the greatest humbugs you have the misfortune to be acquainted with . ''
Parsing [sent. 309 len. 3]: `` Ha !
Parsing [sent. 310 len. 2]: ha !
Parsing [sent. 311 len. 2]: ha !
Parsing [sent. 312 len. 11]: -- No , no ; I do n't say that .
Parsing [sent. 313 len. 40]: I know so well how to make allowance for the prejudices a man has inherited from foolish ancestors , and which have been instilled into him , as well , with his earliest nourishment , both bodily and mental .
Parsing [sent. 314 len. 76]: But -- come now -- I do love open dealing -- I am myself open as the day -- did you not take to the church as a profession , in which you might eat a piece of bread -- as somebody says in your own blessed Bible -- dry enough bread it may be , for the old lady is not over-generous to her younger children -- still a gentlemanly sort of livelihood ? ''
Parsing [sent. 315 len. 5]: Wingfold held his peace .
Parsing [sent. 316 len. 33]: It was incontestably with such a view that he had signed the articles and sought holy orders -- and that without a single question as to truth or reality in either act .
Parsing [sent. 317 len. 20]: `` Your silence is honesty , Mr. Wingfold , and I honour you for it , '' said Bascombe .
Parsing [sent. 318 len. 41]: `` It is an easy thing for a man in another profession to speak his mind , but silence such as yours , casting a shadow backward over your past , require courage : I honour you , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 319 len. 19]: As he spoke , he laid his hand on Wingfold 's shoulder with the grasp of an athlete .
Parsing [sent. 320 len. 12]: `` Can the sherry have anything to do with it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 321 len. 4]: thought the curate .
Parsing [sent. 322 len. 14]: The fellow was , or seemed to be , years younger than himself !
Parsing [sent. 323 len. 17]: It was an assurance unimaginable -- yet there it stood -- six feet of it good !
Parsing [sent. 324 len. 7]: He glanced at the church tower .
Parsing [sent. 325 len. 7]: It had not vanished in mist !
Parsing [sent. 326 len. 14]: It still made its own strong , clear mark on the eternal blue !
Parsing [sent. 327 len. 21]: `` I must not allow you to mistake my silence , Mr. Bascombe , '' he answered the same moment .
Parsing [sent. 328 len. 14]: `` It is not easy to reply to such demands all at once .
Parsing [sent. 329 len. 26]: It is not easy to say in times like these , and at a moment 's notice , what or how much a man believes .
Parsing [sent. 330 len. 33]: But whatever my answer might be had I time to consider it , my silence must at least not be interpreted to mean that I do NOT believe as my profession indicates .
Parsing [sent. 331 len. 11]: That , at all events , would be untrue . ''
Parsing [sent. 332 len. 27]: `` Then I am to understand , Mr. Wingfold , that you neither believe nor disbelieve the tenets of the church whose bread you eat ? ''
Parsing [sent. 333 len. 12]: said Bascombe , with the air of a reprover of sin .
Parsing [sent. 334 len. 41]: `` I decline to place myself between the horns of any such dilemma , '' returned Wingfold , who was now more than a little annoyed at his persistency in forcing his way within the precincts of another 's personality .
Parsing [sent. 335 len. 49]: `` It is but one more proof -- more than was necessary -- to convince me that the old system is a lie -- a lie of the worst sort , seeing it may prevail even to the self-deception of a man otherwise remarkable for honesty and directness .
Parsing [sent. 336 len. 7]: Good night , Mr. Wingfold . ''
Parsing [sent. 337 len. 12]: With lifted hats , but no hand-shaking , the men parted .
Parsing [sent. 338 len. 3]: CHAPTER VI .
Parsing [sent. 339 len. 6]: THE CURATE IN THE CHURCHYARD .
Parsing [sent. 340 len. 78]: Bascombe was chagrined to find that the persuasive eloquence with which he hoped soon to play upon the convictions of jurymen at his own sweet will , had not begotten even communicativenes , not to say confidence , in the mind of a parson who knew himself fooled , -- and partly that it gave him cause to doubt how far it might be safe to urge his attack in another and to him more important quarter .
Parsing [sent. 341 len. 15]: He had a passion for convincing people , this Hercules of the new world .
Parsing [sent. 342 len. 63]: He sauntered slowly back to his aunt 's , husbanding his cigar a little , and looking up at the moon now and then , -- not to admire the marvel of her shining , but to think yet again what a fit type of an effete superstition she was , in that she retained her power of fascination even in death .
Parsing [sent. 343 len. 17]: Wingfold walked slowly away , with his eyes on the ground gliding from under his footsteps .
Parsing [sent. 344 len. 18]: It was only eleven o'clock , but this the oldest part of the town seemed already asleep .
Parsing [sent. 345 len. 18]: They had not met a single person on their way , and hardly seen a lighted window .
Parsing [sent. 346 len. 41]: But he felt unwilling to go home , which at first he was fain to attribute to his having drunk a little more wine than was good for him , whence this feverishness and restlessness so strange to his experience .
Parsing [sent. 347 len. 54]: In the churchyard , on the other side of which his lodging lay , he turned aside from the flagged path and sat down upon a gravestone , where he was hardly seated ere he began to discover that it was something else than the wine which had made him feel so uncomfortable .
Parsing [sent. 348 len. 9]: What an objectionable young fellow that Bascombe was !
Parsing [sent. 349 len. 23]: -- presuming and arrogant to a degree rare , he hoped , even in a profession for which insolence was a qualification .
Parsing [sent. 350 len. 37]: What rendered it worse was that his good nature -- and indeed every one of his gifts , which were all of the popular order -- was subservient to an assumption not only self-satisfied but obtrusive !
Parsing [sent. 351 len. 36]: -- And yet -- and yet -- the objectionable character of his self-constituted judge being clear as the moon to the mind of the curate , was there not something in what he had said ?
Parsing [sent. 352 len. 51]: This much remained undeniable at least , that when the very existence of the church was denounced as a humbug in the hearing of one who ate her bread , and was her pledged servant , his very honesty had kept that man from speaking a word in her behalf !
Parsing [sent. 353 len. 15]: Something must be wrong somewhere : was it in him or in the church ?
Parsing [sent. 354 len. 10]: In him assuredly , whether in her or not .
Parsing [sent. 355 len. 47]: For had he not been unable to utter the simple assertion that he did believe the things which , as the mouthpiece of the church , he had been speaking in the name of the truth every Sunday -- would again speak the day after to-morrow ?
Parsing [sent. 356 len. 15]: And now the point was -- WHY could he not say he believed them ?
Parsing [sent. 357 len. 64]: He had never consciously questioned them ; he did not question them now ; and yet , when a forward , overbearing young infidel of a lawyer put it to him -- plump -- as if he were in the witness-box , or rather indeed in the dock -- did he believe a word of what the church had set him to teach ?
Parsing [sent. 358 len. 9]: -- a strange something -- was it honesty ?
Parsing [sent. 359 len. 12]: -- if so , how dishonest had he not hitherto been ?
Parsing [sent. 360 len. 5]: -- was it diffidence ?
Parsing [sent. 361 len. 12]: -- if so , how presumptuous his position in that church !
Parsing [sent. 362 len. 42]: -- this nondescript something seemed to raise a `` viewless obstruction '' in his throat , and , having thus rendered him the first moment incapable of speaking out like a man , had taught him the next -- had it ?
Parsing [sent. 363 len. 16]: -- to quibble -- `` like a priest '' the lawyer-fellow would doubtless have said !
Parsing [sent. 364 len. 32]: He must go home and study Paley -- or perhaps Butler 's Analogy -- he owed the church something , and ought to be able to strike a blow for her .
Parsing [sent. 365 len. 7]: Or would not Leighton be better ?
Parsing [sent. 366 len. 17]: Or a more modern writer -- say Neander , or Coleridge , or perhaps Dr. Liddon ?
Parsing [sent. 367 len. 22]: There were thousands able to fit him out for the silencing of such foolish men as this Bascombe of the shirt-front !
Parsing [sent. 368 len. 28]: Wingfold found himself filled with contempt , but the next moment was not sure whether this Bascombe or one Wingfold were the more legitimate object of it .
Parsing [sent. 369 len. 32]: One thing was undeniable -- his friends HAD put him into the priest 's office , and he had yielded to go , that he might eat a piece of bread .
Parsing [sent. 370 len. 39]: He had no love for it except by fits , when the beauty of an anthem , or the composition of a collect , awoke in him a faint consenting admiration , or a weak , responsive sympathy .
Parsing [sent. 371 len. 32]: Did he not , indeed , sometimes despise himself , and that pretty heartily , for earning his bread by work which any pious old woman could do better than he ?
Parsing [sent. 372 len. 30]: True , he attended to his duties ; not merely `` did church , '' but his endeavour also that all things should be done decently and in order .
Parsing [sent. 373 len. 86]: All the same it remained a fact that if Barrister Bascombe were to stand up and assert in full congregation -- as no doubt he was perfectly prepared to do -- that there was no God anywhere in the universe , the Rev. Thomas Wingfold could not , on the church 's part , prove to anybody that there was ; -- dared not , indeed , so certain would he be of discomfiture , advance a single argument on his side of the question .
Parsing [sent. 374 len. 9]: Was it even HIS side of the question ?
Parsing [sent. 375 len. 10]: Could he say he believed there was a God ?
Parsing [sent. 376 len. 51]: Or was not this all he knew -- that there was a church of England , which paid him for reading public prayers to a God in whom the congregation -- and himself -- were supposed by some to believe , by others , Bascombe , for instance , not ?
Parsing [sent. 377 len. 12]: These reflections were not pleasant , especially with Sunday so near .
Parsing [sent. 378 len. 35]: For what if there were hundreds , yes , thousands of books , triumphantly settling every question which an over-seething and ill-instructed brain might by any chance suggest , -- what could it boot ?
Parsing [sent. 379 len. 89]: -- how was a poor finite mortal , with much the ordinary faculty and capacity , and but a very small stock already stored , to set about reading , studying , understanding , mastering , appropriating the contents of those thousands of volumes necessary to the arming of him who , without pretending himself the mighty champion to seek the dragon in his den , might yet hope not to let the loathly worm swallow him , armour and all , at one gulp in the highway ?
Parsing [sent. 380 len. 11]: Add to this that -- thought of all most dismayful !
Parsing [sent. 381 len. 103]: -- he had himself to convince first , the worst dragon of all to kill , for bare honesty 's sake , in his own field ; while , all the time he was arming and fighting -- like the waves of the flowing tide in a sou ' - wester , Sunday came in upon Sunday , roaring on his flat , defenceless shore , Sunday behind Sunday rose towering , in awful perspective , away to the verge of an infinite horizon -- Sunday after Sunday of dishonesty and sham -- yes , hypocrisy , far worse than any idolatry .
Parsing [sent. 382 len. 42]: To begin now , and in such circumstances , to study the evidences of Christianity , were about as reasonable as to send a man , whose children were crying for their dinner , off to China to make his fortune !
Parsing [sent. 383 len. 83]: He laughed the idea to scorn , discovered that a gravestone in a November midnight was a cold chair for study , rose , stretched himself disconsolately , almost despairingly , looked long at the persistent solidity of the dark church and the waving line of its age-slackened ridge , which , like a mountain-range , shot up suddenly in the tower and ceased -- then turning away left the houses of the dead crowded all about the house of the resurrection .
Parsing [sent. 384 len. 17]: At the farther gate he turned yet again , and gazed another moment on the tower .
Parsing [sent. 385 len. 12]: Towards the sky it towered , and led his gaze upward .
Parsing [sent. 386 len. 35]: There still soared , yet rested , the same quiet night with its delicate heaps of transparent blue , its cool-glowing moon , its steely stars , and its something he did not understand .
Parsing [sent. 387 len. 21]: He went home a little quieter of heart , as if he had heard from afar something sweet and strange .
Parsing [sent. 388 len. 3]: CHAPTER VII .
Parsing [sent. 389 len. 3]: THE COUSINS .
Parsing [sent. 390 len. 17]: George Bascombe was a peculiar development of the present century , almost of the present generation .
Parsing [sent. 391 len. 20]: In the last century , beyond a doubt , the description of such a man would have been incredible .
Parsing [sent. 392 len. 15]: I do not mean that he was the worse or the better for that .
Parsing [sent. 393 len. 20]: There are types both of good and of evil which to the past would have been incredible because unintelligible .
Parsing [sent. 394 len. 80]: It is very hard sometimes for a tolerably honest man , as we have just seen in the case of Wingfold , to say what he believes , and it ought to be yet harder to say what another man does not believe ; therefore I shall presume no farther concerning Bascombe in this respect than to say that the thing he SEEMED most to believe was that he had a mission to destroy the beliefs of everybody else .
Parsing [sent. 395 len. 52]: Whence he derived this mission he would not have thought a reasonable question -- would have answered that , if any man knew any truth unknown to another , understood any truth better , or could present it more clearly than another , the truth itself was his commission of apostleship .
Parsing [sent. 396 len. 9]: And his stand was indubitably a firm one .
Parsing [sent. 397 len. 16]: Only there was the question -- whether his presumed commission was verily truth or no .
Parsing [sent. 398 len. 12]: It must be allowed that a good deal turns upon that .
Parsing [sent. 399 len. 49]: According to the judgment of some men who thought they knew him , Bascombe was as yet -- I will not say incapable of distinguishing , but careless of the distinction between -- not a fact and a law , perhaps , but a law and a truth .
Parsing [sent. 400 len. 44]: They said also that he inveighed against the beliefs of other people , without having ever seen more than a distorted shadow of those beliefs -- some of them he was not capable of seeing , they said -- only capable of denying .
Parsing [sent. 401 len. 56]: Now while he would have been perfectly justified , they said , in asserting that he saw no truth in the things he denied , was he justifiable in concluding that his not seeing a thing was a proof of its non-existence -- anything more , in fact , than a presumption against its existence ?
Parsing [sent. 402 len. 32]: or in denouncing every man who said he believed this or that which Bascombe did not believe , as either a knave or a fool , if not both in one ?
Parsing [sent. 403 len. 45]: He would , they said , judge anybody -- a Shakespeare , a Bacon , a Milton -- without a moment 's hesitation or a quiver of reverence -- judge men who , beside him , were as the living ocean to a rose-diamond .
Parsing [sent. 404 len. 13]: If he was armed in honesty , the rivets were of self-satisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 405 len. 11]: The suit , they allowed , was adamantine , unpierceable .
Parsing [sent. 406 len. 34]: That region of a man 's nature which has to do with the unknown was in Bascombe shut off by a wall without chink or cranny ; he was unaware of its existence .
Parsing [sent. 407 len. 34]: He had come out of the darkness , and was going back into the darkness ; all that lay between , plain and clear , he had to do with -- nothing more .
Parsing [sent. 408 len. 24]: He could not present to himself the idea of a man who found it impossible to live without some dealings with the supernal .
Parsing [sent. 409 len. 19]: To him a man 's imagination was of no higher calling than to amuse him with its vagaries .
Parsing [sent. 410 len. 45]: He did not know , apparently , that Imagination had been the guide to all the physical discoveries which he worshipped , therefore could not reason that perhaps she might be able to carry a glimmering light even into the forest of the supersensible .
Parsing [sent. 411 len. 28]: How far he was original in the views he propounded , will , to those who understand the times of which I write , be plain enough .
Parsing [sent. 412 len. 77]: The lively reception of another man 's doctrine , especially if it comes over water or across a few ages of semi-oblivion , and has to be gathered with occasional help from a dictionary , raises many a man , in his own esteem , to the same rank with its first propounder ; after which he will propound it so heartily himself as to forget the difference , and love it as his own child .
Parsing [sent. 413 len. 69]: It may seem strange that the son of a clergyman should take such a part in the world 's affairs , but one who observes will discover that , at college at least , the behaviour of sons of clergymen resembles in general as little as that of any , and less than that of most , the behaviour enjoined by the doctrines their fathers have to teach .
Parsing [sent. 414 len. 12]: The cause of this is matter of consideration for those fathers .
Parsing [sent. 415 len. 65]: In Bascombe 's case , it must be mentioned also that , instead of taking freedom from prejudice as a portion of the natural accomplishment of a gentleman , he prided himself upon it , and THEREFORE would often go dead against the things presumed to be held by THE CLOTH , long before he had begun to take his position as an iconoclast .
Parsing [sent. 416 len. 55]: Lest I should , however , tire my reader with the delineations of a character not of the most interesting , I shall , for the present , only add that Bascombe had persuaded himself , and without much difficulty , that he was one of the prophets of a new order of things .
Parsing [sent. 417 len. 31]: At Cambridge he had been so regarded by a few who had lauded him as a mighty foe to humbug -- and in some true measure he deserved the praise .
Parsing [sent. 418 len. 31]: Since then he had found a larger circle , and had even radiated of his light , such , as it was , from the centres of London editorial offices .
Parsing [sent. 419 len. 47]: But all I have to do with now is the fact that he had grown desirous to add his cousin , Helen Lingard , to the number of those who believed in him , and over whom , therefore , he exercised a prophet 's influence .
Parsing [sent. 420 len. 43]: No doubt it added much to the attractiveness of the intellectual game that the hunt was on the home grounds of such a proprietress as Helen -- a handsome , a gifted , and , above all , a ladylike young woman .
Parsing [sent. 421 len. 21]: To do Bascombe justice , the fact that she was an heiress also had very little weight in the matter .
Parsing [sent. 422 len. 36]: If he had ever had any thought of marrying her , that thought was not consciously present to him when first he became aware of his wish to convert her to his views of life .
Parsing [sent. 423 len. 26]: But , although he was not in love with her , he admired her , and believed he saw in her one that resembled himself .
Parsing [sent. 424 len. 27]: As to Helen , although she was no more conscious of cause of self-dissatisfaction than her cousin , she was not therefore positively self-satisfied like him .
Parsing [sent. 425 len. 9]: For that her mind was not active enough .
Parsing [sent. 426 len. 91]: If it seem , as it may , to some of my readers , difficult to believe that she should have come to her years without encountering any questions , giving life to any aspirations , or even forming any opinions that could rightly be called her own , I would remind them that she had always had good health , and that her intellectual faculties had been kept in full and healthy exercise , nor had once afforded the suspicion of a tendency towards artistic utterance in any direction .
Parsing [sent. 427 len. 37]: She was no mere dabbler in anything : in music , for instance , she had studied thorough bass , and studied it well ; yet her playing was such as I have already described it .
Parsing [sent. 428 len. 30]: She understood perspective , and could copy an etching , in pen and ink , to a hair 's - breadth , yet her drawing was hard and mechanical .
Parsing [sent. 429 len. 47]: She was pretty much at home in Euclid , and thoroughly enjoyed a geometric relation , but had never yet shown her English master the slightest pleasure in an analogy , or the smallest sympathy with any poetry higher than such as very properly delights schoolboys .
Parsing [sent. 430 len. 12]: Ten thousand things she knew without wondering at one of them .
Parsing [sent. 431 len. 17]: Any attempt to rouse her admiration , she invariably received with quiet intelligence but no response .
Parsing [sent. 432 len. 24]: Yet her drawing-master was convinced there lay a large soul asleep somewhere below the calm grey morning of that wide-awake yet reposeful intelligence .
Parsing [sent. 433 len. 79]: As far as she knew -- only she had never thought anything about it -- she was in harmony with creation animate and inanimate , and for what might or might not be above creation , or at the back , or the heart , or the mere root of it , how could she think about a something the idea of which had never yet been presented to her by love or philosophy , or even curiosity ?
Parsing [sent. 434 len. 38]: As for any influence from the public offices of religion , a contented soul may glide through them all for a long life , unstruck to the last , buoyant and evasive as a bee amongst hailstones .
Parsing [sent. 435 len. 39]: And now her cousin , unsolicited , was about to assume , if she should permit him , the unspiritual direction of her being , so that she need never be troubled from the quarter of the unknown .
Parsing [sent. 436 len. 44]: Mrs. Ramshorn 's house had formerly been the manor-house , and , although it now stood in an old street , with only a few yards of ground between it and the road , it had a large and ancient garden behind it .
Parsing [sent. 437 len. 26]: A large garden of any sort is valuable , but an ancient garden is invaluable , and this one had retained a very antique loveliness .
Parsing [sent. 438 len. 28]: The quaint memorials of its history lived on into the new , changed , unsympathetic time , and stood there , aged , modest , and unabashed .
Parsing [sent. 439 len. 60]: Yet not one of the family had ever cared for it on the ground of its old-fashionedness ; its preservation was owing merely to the fact that their gardener was blessed with a wholesome stupidity rendering him incapable of unlearning what his father , who had been gardener there before him , had had marvellous difficulty in teaching him .
Parsing [sent. 440 len. 16]: We do not half appreciate the benefits to the race that spring from honest dulness .
Parsing [sent. 441 len. 9]: The CLEVER people are the ruin of everything .
Parsing [sent. 442 len. 85]: Into this garden , Bascombe walked the next morning , after breakfast , and Helen , who , next to the smell of a fir-wood fire , honestly liked the odour of a good cigar , spying him from her balcony , which was the roof of the veranda , where she was trimming the few remaining chrysanthemums that stood outside the window of her room , ran down the little wooden stair that led from it to the garden , and joined him .
Parsing [sent. 443 len. 12]: Nothing could just at present have been more to his mind .
Parsing [sent. 444 len. 3]: CHAPTER VIII .
Parsing [sent. 445 len. 3]: THE GARDEN .
Parsing [sent. 446 len. 8]: `` Take a cigar , Helen ? ''
Parsing [sent. 447 len. 3]: said George .
Parsing [sent. 448 len. 17]: `` No , thank you , '' answered Helen ; `` I like it diluted . ''
Parsing [sent. 449 len. 16]: `` I do n't see why ladies should not have things strong as men . ''
Parsing [sent. 450 len. 9]: `` Not if they do n't want them .
Parsing [sent. 451 len. 22]: You ca n't enjoy everything -- I mean , one ca n't have the strong and the delicate both at once .
Parsing [sent. 452 len. 20]: I do n't believe a smoker can have the same pleasure in smelling a rose that I have . ''
Parsing [sent. 453 len. 13]: `` Is n't it a pity we never can compare sensations ? ''
Parsing [sent. 454 len. 21]: `` I do n't think it matters much : everyone would have to keep to his own after all . ''
Parsing [sent. 455 len. 7]: `` That 's good , Helen !
Parsing [sent. 456 len. 17]: If ever man try to humbug you , he will find he has lost his stirrups .
Parsing [sent. 457 len. 18]: If only there were enough like you left in this miserable old hulk of a creation ! ''
Parsing [sent. 458 len. 26]: It was an odd thing that when in the humour of finding fault , Bascombe would not unfrequently speak of the cosmos as a creation .
Parsing [sent. 459 len. 9]: He was himself unaware of the curious fact .
Parsing [sent. 460 len. 14]: `` You seem to have a standing quarrel with the creation , George !
Parsing [sent. 461 len. 24]: Yet one might think you had as little ground as most people to complain of your portion in it , '' said Helen .
Parsing [sent. 462 len. 13]: `` Well , you know , I do n't complain for myself .
Parsing [sent. 463 len. 11]: I do n't pretend to think I am specially ill-used .
Parsing [sent. 464 len. 6]: But I am not everybody .
Parsing [sent. 465 len. 13]: And then there 's such a lot of born-fools in it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 466 len. 12]: `` If they are born-fools they ca n't help it . ''
Parsing [sent. 467 len. 32]: `` That may be ; only it makes it none the pleasanter for other people ; but , unfortunately , they are not the only or the worst sort of fools .
Parsing [sent. 468 len. 10]: For one born-fool there are a thousand wilful ones .
Parsing [sent. 469 len. 21]: For one man that will honestly face an honest argument , there are ten thousand that will dishonestly shirk it .
Parsing [sent. 470 len. 19]: There 's that curate-fellow now -- Wingfold I think aunt called him -- look at him now ! ''
Parsing [sent. 471 len. 16]: `` I ca n't see much in him to rouse indignation , '' said Helen .
Parsing [sent. 472 len. 9]: `` He seems a very inoffensive man . ''
Parsing [sent. 473 len. 104]: `` I do n't call it inoffensive when a man sells himself to the keeping up of a system that -- '' Here Bascombe checked himself , remembering that a sudden attack upon what was , at least , the more was the pity , a time-honoured system , might rouse a woman 's prejudices ; and as Helen had already listened to a large amount of undermining remark without perceiving the direction of his tunnels , he resolved , before venturing an open assault , to make sure that those prejudices stood , lightly borne , over an abyss of seething objection .
Parsing [sent. 474 len. 51]: He had had his experiences as the prophet-pioneer of glad tidings to the nations , and had before now , although such weakness he could not anticipate in Helen , seen one whom he considered a most promising pupil , turned suddenly away in a storm of terror and disgust .
Parsing [sent. 475 len. 79]: `` What a folly is it now , '' he instantly resumed , leaving the general and attacking a particular , `` to think to make people good by promises and threats -- promises of a heaven that would bore the dullest among them to death , and threats of a hell the very idea of which , if only half conceived , would be enough to paralyse every nerve of healthy action in the human system ! ''
Parsing [sent. 476 len. 20]: `` All nations have believed in a future state , either of reward or punishment , '' objected Helen .
Parsing [sent. 477 len. 12]: `` Mere Brocken-spectres of their own approbation or disapprobation of themselves .
Parsing [sent. 478 len. 9]: And whither has it brought the race ? ''
Parsing [sent. 479 len. 12]: `` What then would you substitute for it , George ? ''
Parsing [sent. 480 len. 5]: `` Why substitute anything ?
Parsing [sent. 481 len. 18]: Ought not men be good to one another because they are made up of ones and others ?
Parsing [sent. 482 len. 13]: Do you or I need threats and promises to make us kind ?
Parsing [sent. 483 len. 12]: And what right have we to judge others worse than ourselves ?
Parsing [sent. 484 len. 45]: Mutual compassion , '' he went on , blowing out a mouthful of smoke and then swelling his big chest with a huge lungsful of air , `` might be sufficient to teach poor ephemerals kindness and consideration enough to last their time . ''
Parsing [sent. 485 len. 12]: `` But how would you bring such reflections to bear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 486 len. 5]: asked Helen , pertinently .
Parsing [sent. 487 len. 48]: `` I would reason thus : You must consider that you are but a part of the whole , and that whatever you do to hurt the whole , or injure any of its parts , will return upon you who form one of those parts . ''
Parsing [sent. 488 len. 17]: `` How would that influence the man whose favourite amusement is to beat his wife ! ''
Parsing [sent. 489 len. 9]: `` Not at all , I grant you .
Parsing [sent. 490 len. 19]: But that man is what he is from being born and bred under a false and brutal system .
Parsing [sent. 491 len. 60]: Having deluged his delicate brain with the poisonous fumes of adulterated liquor , and so roused all the terrors of a phantom-haunted imagination , he sees hostile powers above watching for his fall , and fiery ruin beneath gaping to receive him , and in pure despair acts like the madman the priests and the publicans have made him .
Parsing [sent. 492 len. 81]: Helen , '' continued Bascombe with solemnity , regarding her fixedly , `` to deliver the race from the horrors of such falsehoods , which by no means operate only on the vulgar and brutal , for to how many of the most refined and delicate of human beings are not their lives rendered bitter by the evil suggestions of lying systems -- I care not what they are called -- philosophy , religion , society , I care not ?
Parsing [sent. 493 len. 22]: -- to deliver men , I say , from such ghouls of the human brain , were indeed to have lived !
Parsing [sent. 494 len. 86]: and in the consciousness of having spent his life in the slaying of such dragons , a man may well go from the nameless past into the nameless future rejoicing , careless even if his poor length of days be shortened by his labours to leave blessing behind him , and , full of courage even in the moment of final dissolution , cast her mockery back into the face of mocking Life , and die her enemy , and the friend of Death ! ''
Parsing [sent. 495 len. 8]: George 's language was a little confused .
Parsing [sent. 496 len. 19]: Perhaps he mingled his ideas a little for Helen 's sake -- or rather for obscurity 's sake .
Parsing [sent. 497 len. 36]: Anyhow , the mournful touch in it was not his own , but taken from the poems of certain persons whose opinions resembled his , but floated on the surface of mighty and sad hearts .
Parsing [sent. 498 len. 27]: Tall , stately , comfortable Helen walked composedly by his side , softly shared his cigar , and thought what a splendid pleader he would make .
Parsing [sent. 499 len. 31]: Perhaps to her it sounded rather finer than it was , for its tone of unselfishness , the aroma of self-devotion that floated about it , pleased and attracted her .
Parsing [sent. 500 len. 60]: Was not here a youth in the prime of being and the dawn of success , handsome , and smoking the oldest of Havannahs , who , so far from being enamoured of his own existence , was anxious and careful about that of less favoured mortals , for whose welfare indeed he was willing to sacrifice his life ?
Parsing [sent. 501 len. 9]: -- nothing less could be what he meant .
Parsing [sent. 502 len. 25]: And how fine he looked as he said it , with his head erect , and his nostrils quivering like those of a horse !
Parsing [sent. 503 len. 8]: For his honesty , that was self-evident !
Parsing [sent. 504 len. 52]: Perhaps , had she been capable of looking into it , the self-evident honesty might have resolved itself into this -- that he thoroughly believed in himself ; that he meant what he said ; and that he offered her nothing he did not prize and cleave to as his own .
Parsing [sent. 505 len. 67]: To one who had read Darwin , and had chanced to see them as they walked in their steady , stately young life among the ancient cedars and clipped yews of the garden , with the rags and tatters of the ruined summer hanging over and around them , they must have looked as fine an instance of natural selection as the world had to show .
Parsing [sent. 506 len. 30]: And now in truth for the first time , with any shadow of purpose , that is , did the thought of Helen as a wife occur to Bascombe .
Parsing [sent. 507 len. 128]: She listened so well , was so ready to take what he presented to her , was evidently so willing to become a pupil , that he began to say to himself that here was the very woman made -- no , not made , that implied a maker -- but for him , without the MADE ; that is , if ever he should bring himself by marriage to limit the freedom to which man , the crown of the world , the blossom of nature , the cauliflower of the spine , was predestined or doomed , without will in himself or beyond himself , from an eternity of unthinking matter , ever producing what was better than itself in the prolific darkness of non-intent .
Parsing [sent. 508 len. 3]: CHAPTER IX .
Parsing [sent. 509 len. 3]: THE PARK .
Parsing [sent. 510 len. 45]: At the bottom of Mrs. Ramshorn 's garden was a deep sunk fence , which allowed a large meadow , a fragment of what had once been the manor-park , to belong , so far as the eye was concerned , to the garden .
Parsing [sent. 511 len. 32]: Nor was this all , for in the sunk fence was a door with a little tunnel , by which they could pass at once from the garden to the meadow .
Parsing [sent. 512 len. 51]: So , the day being wonderfully fine , Bascombe proposed to his cousin a walk in the park , the close-paling of which , with a small door in it , whereto Mrs. Ramshorn had the privilege of a key , was visible on the other side of the meadow .
Parsing [sent. 513 len. 23]: The two keys had but to be fetched from the house , and in a few minutes they were in the park .
Parsing [sent. 514 len. 59]: The turf was dry , the air was still , and although the woods were very silent , and looked mournfully bare , the grass drew nearer to the roots of the trees , and the sunshine filled them with streaks of gold , blending lovelily with the bright green of the moss that patched the older stems .
Parsing [sent. 515 len. 89]: Neither horses nor dogs say to themselves , I suppose , that the sunshine makes them glad , yet both are happier , after the rules of equine and canine existence , on a bright day : neither Helen nor George could have understood a poem of Keats -- not to say Wordsworth -- -LRB- I do not mean they would not have fancied they did -RRB- -- and yet the soul of nature that dwelt in these common shows did not altogether fail of influence upon them .
Parsing [sent. 516 len. 17]: `` I wonder what the birds do with themselves all the winter , '' said Helen .
Parsing [sent. 517 len. 15]: `` Eat berries , and make the best of it , '' answered George .
Parsing [sent. 518 len. 9]: `` I mean what becomes of them all .
Parsing [sent. 519 len. 8]: We see so few of them . ''
Parsing [sent. 520 len. 10]: `` About as many as you see in summer .
Parsing [sent. 521 len. 11]: Because you hear them you fancy you see them . ''
Parsing [sent. 522 len. 13]: `` But there is so little to hide them in winter . ''
Parsing [sent. 523 len. 11]: `` Little is wanted to hide our dusky creatures . ''
Parsing [sent. 524 len. 15]: `` They must have a hard time of it in frost and snow . ''
Parsing [sent. 525 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 526 len. 9]: I do n't know , '' returned George .
Parsing [sent. 527 len. 11]: `` They enjoy life on the whole , I believe .
Parsing [sent. 528 len. 18]: It ai n't such a very bad sort of a world as some people would have it .
Parsing [sent. 529 len. 16]: Nature is cruel enough in some of her arrangements , it ca n't be denied .
Parsing [sent. 530 len. 10]: She do n't scruple to carry out her plans .
Parsing [sent. 531 len. 62]: It is nothing to her that for the life of one great monster of a high-priest , millions upon millions of submissive little fishes should be sacrificed ; and then if anybody come within the teeth of her machinery , do n't she mangle him finely -- with her fevers and her agues and her convulsions and consumptions and what not ?
Parsing [sent. 532 len. 41]: But still , barring her own necessities , and the consequences of man 's ignorance and foolhardiness , she is on the whole rather a good-natured old woman , and scatters a deal of tolerably fair enjoyment around her . ''
Parsing [sent. 533 len. 24]: `` One WOULD think the birds must be happy in summer , at least , to hear them sing , '' corroborated Helen .
Parsing [sent. 534 len. 28]: `` Yes , or to see them stripping a hawthorn bush in winter -- always provided the cat or the hawk do n't get hold of them .
Parsing [sent. 535 len. 8]: With that nature does not trouble herself .
Parsing [sent. 536 len. 18]: Well , it 's soon over -- with all of us , and that 's a comfort .
Parsing [sent. 537 len. 33]: If men would only get rid of their cats and hawks , -- such as the fancy for instance , that all their suffering comes of the will of a malignant power !
Parsing [sent. 538 len. 15]: That is the kind of thing that makes the misery of the world ! ''
Parsing [sent. 539 len. 11]: `` I do n't quite see -- '' began Helen .
Parsing [sent. 540 len. 33]: `` We were talking about the birds in winter , '' interrupted George , careful not to swell too suddenly any of the air-bags with which he would float Helen 's belief .
Parsing [sent. 541 len. 23]: He knew wisely , and he knew how , to leave a hint to work while it was yet not half understood .
Parsing [sent. 542 len. 41]: By the time it was understood , it would have grown a little familiar : the supposed pup when it turned out a cub , would not be so terrible as if it had presented itself at once as leonate .
Parsing [sent. 543 len. 11]: And so they wandered across the park , talking easily .
Parsing [sent. 544 len. 33]: `` They 've got on a good way since I was here last , '' said George , as they came in sight of the new house the new earl was building .
Parsing [sent. 545 len. 15]: `` But they do n't seem much in a hurry with it either . ''
Parsing [sent. 546 len. 38]: `` Aunt says it is twenty years since the foundations were laid by the uncle of the present earl , '' said Helen ; `` and then for some reason or other the thing was dropped . ''
Parsing [sent. 547 len. 11]: `` Was there no house on the place before ? ''
Parsing [sent. 548 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 549 len. 11]: yes -- not much of a house , though . ''
Parsing [sent. 550 len. 11]: `` And they pulled it down , I suppose . ''
Parsing [sent. 551 len. 9]: `` No ; it stands there still . ''
Parsing [sent. 552 len. 4]: `` Where ? ''
Parsing [sent. 553 len. 21]: `` Down in the hollow there -- over those trees -- about the worst place they could have built in .
Parsing [sent. 554 len. 6]: Surely you have seen it !
Parsing [sent. 555 len. 11]: Poldie and I used to run all over it . ''
Parsing [sent. 556 len. 8]: `` No , I never saw it .
Parsing [sent. 557 len. 6]: Was it empty then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 558 len. 6]: `` Yes , or almost .
Parsing [sent. 559 len. 17]: I can remember some little attention paid to the garden , but none to the house .
Parsing [sent. 560 len. 8]: It is just falling slowly to pieces .
Parsing [sent. 561 len. 8]: Would you like to see it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 562 len. 47]: `` That I should , '' returned Bascombe , who was always ready for any new impression on his sensorium , and away they went to look at the old house of Glaston as it was called , after some greatly older and probably fortified place .
Parsing [sent. 563 len. 22]: In the hollow all the water of the park gathered to a lake before finding its way to the river Lythe .
Parsing [sent. 564 len. 20]: This lake was at the bottom of the old garden , and the house at the top of it .
Parsing [sent. 565 len. 19]: The garden was walled on the two sides , and the walls ran right down to the lake .
Parsing [sent. 566 len. 63]: There were wonderful legends current amongst the children of Glaston concerning that lake , its depth , and the creatures in it ; and one terrible story , which had been made a ballad of , about a lady drowned in a sack , whose ghost might still be seen when the moon was old , haunting the gardens and the house .
Parsing [sent. 567 len. 40]: Hence it came that none of them went near it , except those few whose appetites for adventure now and then grew keen enough to prevent their imaginations from rousing more fear than supplied the proper relish of danger .
Parsing [sent. 568 len. 11]: The house itself even those few never dared to enter .
Parsing [sent. 569 len. 10]: Not so had it been with Helen and Leopold .
Parsing [sent. 570 len. 23]: The latter had imagination enough to receive everything offered , but Helen was the leader , and she had next to none .
Parsing [sent. 571 len. 46]: In her childhood she had heard the tales alluded to from her nurses , but she had been to school since , and had learned not to believe them ; and certainly she was not one to be frightened at what she did not believe .
Parsing [sent. 572 len. 27]: So when Leopold came in the holidays , the place was one of their favoured haunts , and they knew every cubic yard in the house .
Parsing [sent. 573 len. 60]: `` Here , '' said Helen to her cousin , as she opened the door in a little closet , and showed a dusky room which had no window but a small one high up in the wall of a back staircase , `` here is one room into which I never could get Poldie without the greatest trouble .
Parsing [sent. 574 len. 17]: I gave it up at last , he always trembled so till he got out again .
Parsing [sent. 575 len. 16]: I will show you such a curious place at the other end of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 576 len. 38]: She led the way to a closet similar to that by which they had entered , and directed Bascombe how to raise a trap which filled all the floor of it so that it did not show .
Parsing [sent. 577 len. 17]: Under the trap was a sort of well , big enough to hold three upon emergency .
Parsing [sent. 578 len. 13]: `` If only they could contrive to breathe , '' said George .
Parsing [sent. 579 len. 5]: `` It looks ugly .
Parsing [sent. 580 len. 15]: If it had but a brain and a tongue it could tell tales . ''
Parsing [sent. 581 len. 7]: `` Come , '' said Helen .
Parsing [sent. 582 len. 21]: `` I do n't know how it is , but I do n't like the look of it myself now .
Parsing [sent. 583 len. 10]: Let us get into the open air again . ''
Parsing [sent. 584 len. 49]: Ascending from the hollow , and passing through a deep belt of trees that surrounded it , they came again to the open park , and by-and-by reached the road that led from the lodge to the new building , upon which they presently encountered a strange couple .
Parsing [sent. 585 len. 3]: CHAPTER X .
Parsing [sent. 586 len. 3]: THE DWARFS .
Parsing [sent. 587 len. 23]: The moment they had passed them , George turned to his cousin with a countenance which bore moral indignation mingled with disgust .
Parsing [sent. 588 len. 26]: The healthy instincts of the elect of his race were offended by the sight of such physical failures , such mockeries of humanity as those .
Parsing [sent. 589 len. 12]: The woman was little if anything over four feet in height .
Parsing [sent. 590 len. 23]: She was crooked , had a high shoulder , and walked like a crab , one leg being shorter than the other .
Parsing [sent. 591 len. 32]: Her companion walked quite straight , with a certain appearance of dignity which he neither assumed nor could have avoided , and which gave his gait the air of a march .
Parsing [sent. 592 len. 22]: He was not an inch taller than the woman , had broad , square shoulders , pigeon-breast , and invisible neck .
Parsing [sent. 593 len. 13]: He was twice her age , and they seemed father and daughter .
Parsing [sent. 594 len. 14]: They heard his breathing , loud with asthma , as they went by .
Parsing [sent. 595 len. 5]: `` Poor things ! ''
Parsing [sent. 596 len. 7]: said Helen , with cold kindness .
Parsing [sent. 597 len. 6]: `` It is shameful ! ''
Parsing [sent. 598 len. 10]: said George , in a tone of righteous anger .
Parsing [sent. 599 len. 9]: `` Such creatures have no right to existence .
Parsing [sent. 600 len. 5]: The horrid manakin ! ''
Parsing [sent. 601 len. 6]: `` But , George ! ''
Parsing [sent. 602 len. 17]: said Helen , in expostulation , `` the poor wretch ca n't help his deformity . ''
Parsing [sent. 603 len. 17]: `` No ; but what right had he to marry and perpetuate such odious misery ! ''
Parsing [sent. 604 len. 14]: `` You are too hasty : the young woman is his niece . ''
Parsing [sent. 605 len. 19]: `` She ought to have been strangled the moment she was born -- for the sake of humanity .
Parsing [sent. 606 len. 7]: Monsters ought not to live . ''
Parsing [sent. 607 len. 26]: `` Unfortunately they have all got mothers , '' said Helen ; and something in her face made him fear he had gone too far .
Parsing [sent. 608 len. 13]: `` Do n't mistake me , dear Helen , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 609 len. 43]: `` I would neither starve nor drown them after they had reached the faculty of resenting such treatment -- of the justice of which , '' he added , smiling , `` I am afraid it would be hard to convince them .
Parsing [sent. 610 len. 26]: But such people actually marry -- I have known cases , -- and that ought to be provided against by suitable enactments and penalties . ''
Parsing [sent. 611 len. 23]: `` And so , '' rejoined Helen , `` because they are unhappy already , you would heap unhappiness upon them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 612 len. 19]: `` Now , Helen , you must not be unfair to me any more than to your hunchbacks .
Parsing [sent. 613 len. 23]: It is the good of the many I seek , and surely that is better than the good of the few . ''
Parsing [sent. 614 len. 27]: `` What I object to is , that it should be at the expense of the few -- who are least able to bear it . ''
Parsing [sent. 615 len. 10]: `` The expense is trifling , '' said Bascombe .
Parsing [sent. 616 len. 55]: `` Grant that it would be better for society that no such -- or rather put it this way : grant that it would be well for each individual that goes to make up society that he were neither deformed , sickly , nor idiotic , and you mean the same that I do .
Parsing [sent. 617 len. 104]: A given space of territory under given conditions will always maintain a certain number of human beings ; therefore such a law as I propose would not mean that the number drawing the breath of heaven should , to take the instance before us in illustration , be two less , but that a certain two of them should not be such as he or she who passed now , creatures whose existence is a burden to them , but such as you and I , Helen , who may say without presumption that we are no disgrace to Nature 's handicraft . ''
Parsing [sent. 618 len. 5]: Helen was not sensitive .
Parsing [sent. 619 len. 9]: She neither blushed nor cast down her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 620 len. 28]: But his tenets , thus expounded , had nothing very repulsive in them so far as she saw , and she made no further objection to them .
Parsing [sent. 621 len. 69]: As they walked up the garden again , through the many lingering signs of a more stately if less luxurious existence than that of their generation , she was calmly listening to a lecture on the ground of law , namely , the resignation of certain personal rights for the securing of other and more important ones : she understood , was mildly interested , and entirely satisfied .
Parsing [sent. 622 len. 32]: They seated themselves in the summer-house , a little wooden room under the down-sloping boughs of a huge cedar , and pursued their conversation -- or rather Bascombe pursued his monologue .
Parsing [sent. 623 len. 30]: A lively girl would in all probability have been bored to death by him , but Helen was not a lively girl , and was not bored at all .
Parsing [sent. 624 len. 57]: Ere they went into the house she had heard , amongst a hundred other things of wisdom , his views concerning crime and punishment -- with which , good and bad , true and false , I shall not trouble my reader , except in regard to one point -- that of the obligation to punish .
Parsing [sent. 625 len. 7]: Upon this point he was severe .
Parsing [sent. 626 len. 35]: No person , he said , ought to allow any weakness of pity to prevent him from bringing to punishment the person who broke the laws upon which the well-being of the community depended .
Parsing [sent. 627 len. 24]: A man must remember that the good of the whole , and not the fate of the individual , was to be regarded .
Parsing [sent. 628 len. 38]: It was altogether a notable sort of tête-à-tête between two such perfect specimens of the race , and as at length they entered the house , they professed to each other to have much enjoyed their walk .
Parsing [sent. 629 len. 68]: Holding the opinions he did , Bascombe was in one thing inconsistent : he went to `` divine service '' on the Sunday with his aunt and cousin -- not to humour Helen 's prejudices , but those of Mrs. Ramshorn , who , belonging , as I have said , to the profession , had strong opinions as to the wickedness of not going to church .
Parsing [sent. 630 len. 38]: It was of no use , he said to himself , trying to upset her ideas , for to succeed would only be to make her miserable , and his design was to make the race happy .
Parsing [sent. 631 len. 59]: In the grand old Abbey , therefore , they heard together morning prayers , the Litany , and the Communion , all in one , after a weariful and lazy modern custom not yet extinct , and then a dull , sensible sermon , short , and tolerably well read , on the duty of forgiveness of injuries .
Parsing [sent. 632 len. 66]: I dare say it did most of the people present a little good , undefinable as the faint influences of starlight , to sit under that `` high embowed roof , '' within that vast artistic isolation , through whose mighty limiting the boundless is embodied , and we learn to feel the awful infinitude of the parent space out of which it is scooped .
Parsing [sent. 633 len. 34]: I dare also say that the tones of the mellow old organ spoke to something in many of the listeners that lay deeper far than the plummet of their self-knowledge had ever sounded .
Parsing [sent. 634 len. 73]: I think also that the prayers , the reading of which , in respect of intelligence , was admirable , were not only regarded as sacred utterances , but felt to be soothing influences by not a few of those who made not the slightest effort to follow them with their hearts ; and I trust that on the whole their church-going tended rather to make them better than to harden them .
Parsing [sent. 635 len. 73]: But as to the main point , the stirring up of the children of the Highest to lay hold of the skirts of their Father 's robe , the waking of the individual conscience to say I WILL ARISE , and the strengthening of the captive Will to break its bonds and stand free in the name of the eternal creating Freedom -- for nothing of that was there any special provision .
Parsing [sent. 636 len. 87]: This belonged , in the nature of things , to the sermon , in which , if anywhere , the voice of the indwelling Spirit might surely be heard -- out of his holy temple , if indeed that be the living soul of man , as St. Paul believed ; but there was no sign that the preacher regarded his office as having any such end , although in his sermon lingered the rudimentary tokens that such must have been the original intent of pulpit-utterance .
Parsing [sent. 637 len. 24]: On the way home , Bascombe made some objections to the discourse , partly to show his aunt that he had been attending .
Parsing [sent. 638 len. 48]: He admitted that one might forgive and forget what did not come within the scope of the law , but , as he had said to Helen before , a man was bound , he said , to punish the wrong which through him affected the community .
Parsing [sent. 639 len. 15]: `` George , '' said his aunt , `` I differ from you there .
Parsing [sent. 640 len. 12]: Nobody ought to go to the law to punish an injury .
Parsing [sent. 641 len. 16]: I would forgive ever so many before I would run the risk of the law .
Parsing [sent. 642 len. 19]: But as to FORGETTING an injury -- some injuries at least -- no , that I never would !
Parsing [sent. 643 len. 24]: -- And I do n't believe , let the young man say what he will , that that is required of anyone . ''
Parsing [sent. 644 len. 4]: Helen said nothing .
Parsing [sent. 645 len. 20]: She had no enemies to forgive , no wrongs worth remembering , and was not interested in the question .
Parsing [sent. 646 len. 9]: She thought it a very good sermon indeed .
Parsing [sent. 647 len. 50]: When Bascombe left for London in the morning , he carried with him the lingering rustle of silk , the odour of lavender , and a certain blueness , not of the sky , which seemed to have something behind it , as never did the sky to him .
Parsing [sent. 648 len. 47]: He had never met woman so worthy of being his mate , either as regarded the perfection of her form , or the hidden development of her brain -- evident in her capacity for the reception of truth , as his own cousin , Helen Lingard .
Parsing [sent. 649 len. 9]: Might not the relationship account for the fact ?
Parsing [sent. 650 len. 6]: Helen thought nothing to correspond .
Parsing [sent. 651 len. 8]: She considered George a fine manly fellow .
Parsing [sent. 652 len. 10]: What bold and original ideas he had about everything !
Parsing [sent. 653 len. 8]: Her brother was a baby to him !
Parsing [sent. 654 len. 11]: But then Leopold was such a love of a boy !
Parsing [sent. 655 len. 17]: Such eyes and such a smile were not to be seen on this side the world .
Parsing [sent. 656 len. 22]: Helen liked her cousin , was attached to her aunt , but loved her brother Leopold , and loved nobody else .
Parsing [sent. 657 len. 33]: His Hindoo mother , high of caste , had given him her lustrous eyes and pearly smile , which , the first moment she saw him , won his sister 's heart .
Parsing [sent. 658 len. 13]: He was then but eight years old , and she but eleven .
Parsing [sent. 659 len. 43]: Since then , he had been brought up by his father 's elder brother , who had the family estate in Yorkshire , but he had spent part of all his holidays with her , and they often wrote to each other .
Parsing [sent. 660 len. 66]: Of late indeed his letters had not been many , and a rumour had reached her that he was not doing quite satisfactorily at Cambridge , but she explained it away to the full contentment of her own heart , and went on building such castles as her poor aerolithic skill could command , with Leopold ever and always as the sharer of her self-expansion .
Parsing [sent. 661 len. 3]: CHAPTER XI .
Parsing [sent. 662 len. 5]: THE CURATE AT HOME .
Parsing [sent. 663 len. 54]: If we could arrive at the feelings of a fish of the northern ocean around which the waters suddenly rose to tropical temperature , and swarmed with strange forms of life , uncouth and threatening , we should have a fair symbol of the mental condition in which Thomas Wingfold now found himself .
Parsing [sent. 664 len. 23]: The spiritual fluid in which his being floated had become all at once more potent , and he was in consequence uncomfortable .
Parsing [sent. 665 len. 38]: A certain intermittent stinging , as if from the flashes of some moral electricity , had begun to pass in various directions through the crude and chaotic mass he called himself , and he felt strangely restless .
Parsing [sent. 666 len. 11]: It never occurred to him -- as how should it ?
Parsing [sent. 667 len. 80]: -- that he might have commenced undergoing the most marvellous of all changes , -- one so marvellous , indeed , that for a man to foreknow its result or understand what he was passing through , would be more strange than that a caterpillar should recognise in the rainbow-winged butterfly hovering over the flower at whose leaf he was gnawing , the perfected idea of his own potential self -- I mean the change of being born again .
Parsing [sent. 668 len. 30]: Nor were the symptoms such as would necessarily have suggested , even to a man experienced in the natural history of the infinite , that the process had commenced .
Parsing [sent. 669 len. 19]: A restless night followed his reflections in the churchyard , and he did not wake at all comfortable .
Parsing [sent. 670 len. 13]: Not that ever he had been in the way of feeling comfortable .
Parsing [sent. 671 len. 14]: To him life had not been a land flowing with milk and honey .
Parsing [sent. 672 len. 56]: He had had few smiles , and not many of those grasps of the hand which let a man know another man is near him in the battle -- for had it not been something of a battle , how could he have come to the age of six-and-twenty without being worse than he was ?
Parsing [sent. 673 len. 40]: He would not have said : `` All these have I kept from my youth up ; '' but I can say that for several of them he had shown fight , although only One knew anything of it .
Parsing [sent. 674 len. 21]: This morning , then , it was not merely that he did not feel comfortable : he was consciously uncomfortable .
Parsing [sent. 675 len. 8]: Things were getting too hot for him .
Parsing [sent. 676 len. 32]: That infidel fellow had poked several most awkward questions at him -- yes , into him , and a good many more had in him -- self arisen to meet them .
Parsing [sent. 677 len. 44]: Usually he lay a little while before he came to himself ; but this morning he came to himself at once , and not liking the interview , jumped out of bed as if he had hoped to leave himself there behind him .
Parsing [sent. 678 len. 44]: He had always scorned lying , until one day , when still a boy at school , he suddenly found that he had told a lie , after which he hated it -- yet now , if he was to believe -- ah !
Parsing [sent. 679 len. 2]: whom ?
Parsing [sent. 680 len. 14]: did not the positive fellow and his own conscience say the same thing ?
Parsing [sent. 681 len. 11]: -- his profession , his very life was a lie !
Parsing [sent. 682 len. 13]: the very bread he ate grew on the rank fields of falsehood !
Parsing [sent. 683 len. 9]: -- No , no ; it was absurd !
Parsing [sent. 684 len. 5]: it could not be !
Parsing [sent. 685 len. 13]: What had he done to find himself damned to such a depth ?
Parsing [sent. 686 len. 8]: Yet the thing must be looked to .
Parsing [sent. 687 len. 46]: He batht himself without remorse and never even shivered , though the water in his tub was bitterly cold , dressed with more haste than precision , hurried over his breakfast , neglected his newspaper , and took down a volume of early church history .
Parsing [sent. 688 len. 13]: But he could not read : the thing was hopeless -- utterly .
Parsing [sent. 689 len. 24]: With the wolves of doubt and the jackals of shame howling at his heels , how could he start for a thousand-mile race !
Parsing [sent. 690 len. 15]: For God 's sake give him a weapon to turn and face them with !
Parsing [sent. 691 len. 2]: Evidence !
Parsing [sent. 692 len. 51]: all of it that was to be had , was but such as one man received , another man refused ; and the popular acceptance was worth no more in respect of Christianity than of Mahometanism , for how many had given the subject at all better consideration than himself ?
Parsing [sent. 693 len. 16]: And there was Sunday with its wolves and jackals , and but a hedge between !
Parsing [sent. 694 len. 32]: He did not so much mind reading the prayers : he was not accountable for what was in them , although it was bad enough to stand up and read them .
Parsing [sent. 695 len. 30]: Happy thing he was not a dissenter , for then he would have had to pretend to pray from his own soul , which would have been too horrible !
Parsing [sent. 696 len. 6]: But there was the sermon !
Parsing [sent. 697 len. 19]: That at least was supposed to contain , or to be presented as containing , his own sentiments .
Parsing [sent. 698 len. 6]: Now what were his sentiments ?
Parsing [sent. 699 len. 10]: For the life of him he could not tell .
Parsing [sent. 700 len. 14]: Had he ANY sentiments , any opinions , any beliefs , any unbeliefs ?
Parsing [sent. 701 len. 61]: He had plenty of sermons -- old , yellow , respectable sermons , not lithographed , neither composed by mind nor copied out by hand unknown , but in the neat writing of his old D.D. uncle , so legible that he never felt it necessary to read them over beforehand -- just saw that he had the right one .
Parsing [sent. 702 len. 74]: A hundred and fifty-seven such sermons , the odd one for the year that began on a Sunday , of unquestionable orthodoxy , had his kind old uncle left him in his will , with the feeling probably that he was not only setting him up in sermons for life , but giving him a fair start as well in the race of which a stall in some high cathedral was the goal .
Parsing [sent. 703 len. 24]: For his own part he had never made a sermon , at least never one he had judged worth preaching to a congregation .
Parsing [sent. 704 len. 24]: He had rather a high idea , he thought , of preaching , and these sermons of his uncle he considered really excellent .
Parsing [sent. 705 len. 21]: Some of them , however , were altogether doctrinal , some very polemical : of such he must now beware .
Parsing [sent. 706 len. 53]: He would see of what kind was the next in order ; he would read it and make sure it contained nothing he was not , in some degree at least , prepared to hold his face to and defend -- if he could not absolutely swear he believed it purely true .
Parsing [sent. 707 len. 5]: He did as resolved .
Parsing [sent. 708 len. 13]: The first he took up was in defence of the Athanasian creed !
Parsing [sent. 709 len. 5]: That would not do .
Parsing [sent. 710 len. 4]: He tried another .
Parsing [sent. 711 len. 9]: That was upon the Inspiration of the Scriptures .
Parsing [sent. 712 len. 24]: He glanced through it -- found Moses on a level with St. Paul , and Jonah with St. John , and doubted greatly .
Parsing [sent. 713 len. 9]: There might be a sense -- but -- !
Parsing [sent. 714 len. 9]: No , he would not meddle with it .
Parsing [sent. 715 len. 14]: He tried a third : that was on the Authority of the Church .
Parsing [sent. 716 len. 5]: It would not do .
Parsing [sent. 717 len. 63]: He had read each of all these sermons , at least once , to a congregation , with perfect composure and following indifference , if not peace of mind , but now he could not come on one with which he was even in sympathy -- not to say one of which he was certain that it was more true than false .
Parsing [sent. 718 len. 34]: At last he took up the odd one -- that which could come into use but once in a week of years -- and this was the sermon Bascombe heard and commented upon .
Parsing [sent. 719 len. 49]: Having read it over , and found nothing to compromise him with his conscience , which was like an irritable man trying to find his way in a windy wood by means of a broken lantern , he laid all the rest aside and felt a little relieved .
Parsing [sent. 720 len. 108]: Wingfold had never neglected the private duty of a clergyman in regard of morning and evening devotions , but was in the habit of dressing and undressing his soul with the help of certain chosen contents of the prayer-book -- a somewhat circuitous mode of communicating with Him who was so near him , -- that is , if St. Paul was right in saying that he lived , and moved , and was , IN Him ; but that Saturday he knelt by his bedside at noon , and began to pray or try to pray as he had never prayed or tried to pray before .
Parsing [sent. 721 len. 23]: The perplexed man cried out within the clergyman , and pressed for some acknowledgment from God of the being he had made .
Parsing [sent. 722 len. 8]: But -- was it strange to tell ?
Parsing [sent. 723 len. 13]: or if strange , was it not the most natural result nevertheless ?
Parsing [sent. 724 len. 42]: -- almost the same moment he began to pray in this truer fashion , the doubt rushed up in him like a torrent-spring from the fountains of the great deep -- Was there -- could there be a God at all ?
Parsing [sent. 725 len. 10]: a real being who might actually hear his prayer ?
Parsing [sent. 726 len. 83]: In this crowd of houses and shops and churches , amidst buying and selling , and ploughing and praising and backbiting , this endless pursuit of ends and of means to ends , while yet even the wind that blew where it listed blew under laws most fixed , and the courses of the stars were known to a hair 's - breadth , -- was there -- could there be a silent invisible God working his own will in it all ?
Parsing [sent. 727 len. 20]: Was there a driver to that chariot whose multitudinous horses seemed tearing away from the pole in all directions ?
Parsing [sent. 728 len. 27]: and was he indeed , although invisible and inaudible , guiding that chariot , sure as the flight of a comet , straight to its goal ?
Parsing [sent. 729 len. 32]: Or was there a soul to that machine whose myriad wheels went grinding on and on , grinding the stars into dust , matter into man , and man into nothingness ?
Parsing [sent. 730 len. 73]: Was there -- could there be a living heart to the universe that did positively hear him -- poor , misplaced , dishonest , ignorant Thomas Wingfold , who had presumed to undertake a work he neither could perform nor had the courage to forsake , when out of the misery of the grimy little cellar of his consciousness he cried aloud for light and something to make a man of him ?
Parsing [sent. 731 len. 27]: For now that Thomas had begun to doubt like an honest being , every ugly thing within him began to show itself to his awakened probity .
Parsing [sent. 732 len. 29]: But honest and of good parentage as the doubts were , no sooner had they shown themselves than the wings of the ascending prayers fluttered feebly and failed .
Parsing [sent. 733 len. 26]: They sank slowly , fell , and lay as dead , while all the wretchedness of his position rushed back upon him with redoubled inroad .
Parsing [sent. 734 len. 62]: Here was a man who could not pray , and yet must go and read prayers and preach in the old attesting church , as if he too were of those who knew something of the secrets of the Almighty , and could bring out from his treasury , if not things new and surprising , then things old and precious !
Parsing [sent. 735 len. 18]: Ought he not to send round the bell-man to cry aloud that there would be no service ?
Parsing [sent. 736 len. 38]: But what right had he to lay his troubles , the burden of his dishonesty , upon the shoulders of them who faithfully believed , and who looked to him to break to them their daily bread ?
Parsing [sent. 737 len. 43]: And would not any attempt at a statement of the reasons he had for such an outrageous breach of all decorum be taken for a denial of those things concerning which he only desired most earnestly to know that they were true .
Parsing [sent. 738 len. 53]: For he had received from somewhere , he knew not how or whence , a genuine prejudice in favour of Christianity , while of those refractions and distorted reflexes of it which go by its name and rightly disgust many , he had had few of the tenets thrust upon his acceptance .
Parsing [sent. 739 len. 35]: Thus into the dark pool of his dull submissive life , the bold words of the unbeliever had fallen -- a dead stone perhaps , but causing a thousand motions in the living water .
Parsing [sent. 740 len. 71]: Question crowded upon question , and doubt upon doubt , until he could bear it no longer , and starting from the floor on which at last he had sunk prostrate , he rushed in all but involuntary haste from the house , and scarcely knew where he was until , in a sort , he came to himself some little distance from the town , wandering hurriedly in field-paths .
Parsing [sent. 741 len. 3]: CHAPTER XII .
Parsing [sent. 742 len. 3]: AN INCIDENT .
Parsing [sent. 743 len. 11]: It was a fair morning of All Hallows ' summer .
Parsing [sent. 744 len. 39]: The trees were nearly despoiled , but the grass was green , and there was a memory of spring in the low sad sunshine : even the sunshine , the gladdest thing in creation , is sad sometimes .
Parsing [sent. 745 len. 21]: There was no wind , nothing to fight with , nothing to turn his mind from its own miserable perplexities .
Parsing [sent. 746 len. 16]: How endlessly his position as a clergyman , he thought , added to his miseries !
Parsing [sent. 747 len. 54]: Had he been a man unpledged , he could have taken his own time to think out the truths of his relations ; as it was , he felt like a man in a coffin : out he must get , but had not room to make a single vigorous effort for freedom !
Parsing [sent. 748 len. 38]: It did not occur to him yet that , uupressed from without , his honesty unstung , he might have taken more time to find out where he was than would have been either honest or healthful .
Parsing [sent. 749 len. 43]: He came to a stile where his path joined another that ran both ways , and there seated himself , just as the same strange couple I have already described as met by Miss Lingard and Mr. Bascombe approached and went by .
Parsing [sent. 750 len. 33]: After they had gone a good way , he caught sight of something lying in the path , and going to pick it up , found it was a small manuscript volume .
Parsing [sent. 751 len. 12]: With the pleasurable instinct of service , he hastened after them .
Parsing [sent. 752 len. 10]: They heard him , and turning waited his approach .
Parsing [sent. 753 len. 22]: He took off his hat , and presenting the book to the young woman , asked if she had dropped it .
Parsing [sent. 754 len. 48]: Possibly , had they been ordinary people of the class to which they seemed to belong , he would not have uncovered to them , for he naturally shrunk from what might be looked upon as a display of courtesy , but their deformity rendered it imperative .
Parsing [sent. 755 len. 44]: Her face flushed so at sight of the book , that , in order to spare her uneasiness , Wingfold could not help saying with a smile , `` Do not be alarmed : I have not read one word of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 756 len. 22]: She returned his smile with much sweetness , and said -- `` I see I need not have been afraid . ''
Parsing [sent. 757 len. 15]: Her companion joined in thanks and apologies for having caused him so much trouble .
Parsing [sent. 758 len. 10]: Wingfold assured them it had been but a pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 759 len. 35]: It was far from a scrutinizing look with which he regarded them , but the interview left him with the feeling that their faces were refined and intelligent , and their speech was good .
Parsing [sent. 760 len. 75]: Again he lifted his rather shabby hat , the man responded with equal politeness in removing from a great grey head one rather better , and they turned from each other and went their ways , the sight of their malformation arousing in the curate no such questions as those with which it had agitated the tongue , if not the heart , of George Bascombe , to widen the scope of his perplexities .
Parsing [sent. 761 len. 36]: He had heard the loud breathing of the man , and seen the projecting eyes of the woman , but he never said to himself therefore that they were more hardly dealt with than he .
Parsing [sent. 762 len. 49]: Had such a thought occurred to him , he would have comforted the pain of his sympathy with the reflection that at least neither of them was a curate of the church of England who knew positively nothing of the foundation upon which that church professed to stand .
Parsing [sent. 763 len. 12]: How he got through the Sunday he never could have told .
Parsing [sent. 764 len. 13]: What times a man may get through -- he knows not how !
Parsing [sent. 765 len. 33]: As soon as it was over , it was all a mist -- from which gleamed or gloomed large the face of George Bascombe with its keen unbelieving eyes and scornful lips .
Parsing [sent. 766 len. 61]: All the time he was reading the prayers and lessons , all the time he was reading his uncle 's sermon , he had not only been aware of those eyes , but aware also of what lay behind them -- seeing and reading the reflex of himself in Bascombe 's brain ; but nothing more whatever could he recall .
Parsing [sent. 767 len. 20]: Like finger-posts dim seen , on a moorland journey , through the gathering fogs , Sunday after Sunday passed .
Parsing [sent. 768 len. 31]: I will not request my reader to accompany me across the confusions upon which was blowing that wind whose breath was causing a world to pass from chaos to cosmos .
Parsing [sent. 769 len. 49]: One who has ever gone through any experience of the kind himself , will be able to imagine it ; to one who has not , my descriptions would be of small service : he would but shrink from the representation as diseased and of no general interest .
Parsing [sent. 770 len. 26]: And he would be so far right , that the interest in such things must be most particular and individual , or none at all .
Parsing [sent. 771 len. 20]: The weeks passed and seemed to bring him no light , only increased earnestness in the search after it .
Parsing [sent. 772 len. 23]: Some assurance he must find soon , else he would resign his curacy , and look out for a situation as tutor .
Parsing [sent. 773 len. 13]: Of course all this he ought to have gone through long ago !
Parsing [sent. 774 len. 14]: But how can a man go through anything till his hour be come ?
Parsing [sent. 775 len. 38]: Saul of Tarsus was sitting at the feet of Gamaliel when our Lord said to his apostles -- `` Yea , the time cometh , that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth God service . ''
Parsing [sent. 776 len. 33]: Wingfold had all this time been skirting the wall of the kingdom of heaven without even knowing that there was a wall there , not to say seeing a gate in it .
Parsing [sent. 777 len. 43]: The fault lay with those who had brought him up to the church as to the profession of medicine , or the bar , or the drapery business -- as if it lay on one level of choice with other human callings .
Parsing [sent. 778 len. 34]: Nor were the honoured of the church who had taught him free from blame , who never warned him to put his shoes from off his feet for the holiness of the ground .
Parsing [sent. 779 len. 41]: But how were they to warn him , if they had sowed and reaped and gathered into barns on that ground , and had never discovered therein treasure more holy than libraries , incomes , and the visits of royalty ?
Parsing [sent. 780 len. 40]: As to visions of truth that make a man sigh with joy , and enlarge his heart with more than human tenderness -- how many of those men had ever found such treasure in the fields of the church ?
Parsing [sent. 781 len. 15]: How many of them knew save by hearsay whether there be any Holy Ghost !
Parsing [sent. 782 len. 22]: How then were they to warn other men from the dangers of following in their footsteps and becoming such as they ?
Parsing [sent. 783 len. 17]: Where , in a general ignorance and community of fault , shall we begin to blame ?
Parsing [sent. 784 len. 14]: Wingfold had no time to accuse anyone after the first gush of bitterness .
Parsing [sent. 785 len. 28]: He had to awake from the dead and cry for light , and was soon in the bitter agony of the cataleptic struggle between life and death .
Parsing [sent. 786 len. 35]: He thought afterwards , when the time had passed , that surely in this period of darkness he had been visited and upheld by a power whose presence and even influence escaped his consciousness .
Parsing [sent. 787 len. 12]: He knew not how else he could have got through it .
Parsing [sent. 788 len. 49]: Also he remembered that strange helps had come to him ; that the aspects of nature then wonderfully softened towards him , that then first he began to feel sympathy with her ways and shows , and to see in them all the working of a diffused humanity .
Parsing [sent. 789 len. 48]: He remembered how once a hawthorn bud set him weeping ; and how once , as he went miserable to church , a child looked up in his face and smiled , and how in the strength of that smile he had walked boldly to the lectern .
Parsing [sent. 790 len. 35]: He never knew how long he had been in the strange birth agony , in which the soul is as it were at once the mother that bears and the child that is born .
Parsing [sent. 791 len. 3]: CHAPTER XIII .
Parsing [sent. 792 len. 5]: A REPORT OF PROGRESS .
Parsing [sent. 793 len. 59]: In the meantime George Bascombe came and went ; every visit he showed clearer notions as to what he was for , and what he was against ; every visit he found Helen more worthy and desirable than theretofore , and flattered himself he made progress in the conveyance of his opinions and judgments over into her mind .
Parsing [sent. 794 len. 11]: His various accomplishments went far in aid of his design .
Parsing [sent. 795 len. 38]: There was hardly anything Helen could do that George could not do as well , and some he could do better , while there were many things George was at home in which were sealed to her .
Parsing [sent. 796 len. 11]: The satisfaction of teaching such a pupil he found great .
Parsing [sent. 797 len. 50]: When at length he began to make love to her , Helen found it rather agreeable than otherwise ; and , if there was a little more MAKING in it than some women would have liked , Helen was not sufficiently in love with him to detect its presence .
Parsing [sent. 798 len. 90]: Still the pleasure of his preference was such that it opened her mind with a favourable prejudice towards whatever in the shape of theory or doctrine he would have her receive ; and much that a more experienced mind would have rejected because of its evident results in practice , was by her accepted in the ignorance which confined her regard of his propositions to their intellectual relations , and prevented her from following them into their influences upon life , which would have reflected light upon their character .
Parsing [sent. 799 len. 26]: For life in its real sense was to her as yet little more definite and present than a dream that waits for the coming night .
Parsing [sent. 800 len. 40]: Hence , when her cousin at length ventured to attack even those doctrines which all women who have received a Christian education would naturally be expected to revere the most , she was able to listen to him unshocked .
Parsing [sent. 801 len. 72]: But she little thought , or he either , that it was only in virtue of what Christian teaching she had had that she was capable of appreciating what was grand in his doctrine of living for posterity without a hope of good result to self beyond the consciousness that future generations of perishing men and women would be a little more comfortable , and perhaps a little less faulty therefrom .
Parsing [sent. 802 len. 61]: She did not reflect , either , that no one 's theory concerning death is of much weight in his youth while life FEELS interminable , or that the gift of comfort during a life of so little value that the giver can part with it without regret , is scarcely one to be looked upon as a mighty benefaction .
Parsing [sent. 803 len. 12]: `` But truth is truth , '' George would have replied .
Parsing [sent. 804 len. 21]: What you profess to teach them might be a fact , but could never be a truth , I answer .
Parsing [sent. 805 len. 40]: And the veiy value which you falsely put upon facts you have learned to attribute to them from the supposed existence of something at the root of all facts -- namely , TRUTHS , or eternal laws of being .
Parsing [sent. 806 len. 31]: Still , if you believe that men will be happier from learning your discovery that there is no God , preach it , and prosper in proportion to its truth .
Parsing [sent. 807 len. 125]: No ; that from my pen would be a curse -- no , preach it not , I say , until you have searched all spaces of space , up and down , in greatness and smallness -- where I grant indeed , but you can not know , that you will not find him -- and all regions of thought and feeling , all the unknown mental universe of possible discovery -- preach it not until you have searched that also , I say , lest what you count a truth should prove to be no fact , and there should after all be somewhere , somehow , a very , living God , a Truth indeed , in whom is the universe .
Parsing [sent. 808 len. 49]: If you say , `` But I am convinced there is none , '' I answer -- You may be convinced that there is no God such as this or that in whom men imagine they believe , but you can not be convinced there is no God .
Parsing [sent. 809 len. 63]: Meantime George did not forget the present of this life in its future , continued particular about his cigars and his wine , ate his dinners with what some would call a good conscience and I would call a dull one , were I sure it was not a good digestion they really meant , and kept reading hard and to purpose .
Parsing [sent. 810 len. 10]: Matters as between the two made no rapid advance .
Parsing [sent. 811 len. 24]: George went on loving Helen more than any other woman , and Helen went on liking George next best to her brother Leopold .
Parsing [sent. 812 len. 68]: Whether it came of prudence , of which George possessed not a little , of coldness of temperament , or a pride that would first be sure of acceptance , I do not know , but he made no formal offer yet of handing himself over to Helen , and certainly Helen was in no haste to hear , more than he to utter , the irrevocable .
Parsing [sent. 813 len. 3]: CHAPTER XIV .
Parsing [sent. 814 len. 3]: JEREMY TAYLOR .
Parsing [sent. 815 len. 23]: One Tuesday morning , in the spring , the curate received by the local post the following letter dated from The Park-Gate .
Parsing [sent. 816 len. 36]: `` Respected Sir , `` An obligation on my part which you have no doubt forgotten gives me courage to address you on a matter which seems to me of no small consequence concerning yourself .
Parsing [sent. 817 len. 24]: You do not know me , and the name at the end of my letter will have for you not a single association .
Parsing [sent. 818 len. 9]: The matter itself must be its own excuse .
Parsing [sent. 819 len. 15]: `` I sat in a free seat at the Abbey church last Sunday morning .
Parsing [sent. 820 len. 37]: I had not listened long to the sermon ere I began to fancy I foresaw what was coming , and in a few minutes more I seemed to recognise it as one of Jeremy Taylor 's .
Parsing [sent. 821 len. 31]: When I came home , I found that the best portions of one of his sermons had , in the one you read , been wrought up with other material .
Parsing [sent. 822 len. 101]: `` If , sir , I imagined you to be one of such as would willingly have that regarded as their own which was better than they could produce , and would with contentment receive any resulting congratulations , I should feel that I was only doing you a wrong if I gave you a hint which might aid you in avoiding detection ; for the sooner the truth concerning such a one was known , and the judgment of society brought to bear upon it , the better for him , whether the result were justification or the contrary .
Parsing [sent. 823 len. 62]: But I have read that in your countenance and demeanour which convinces me that , however custom and the presence of worldly elements in the community to which you belong may have influenced your judgment , you require only to be set thinking of a matter , to follow your conscience with regard to whatever you may find involved in it .
Parsing [sent. 824 len. 22]: I have the honour to be , respected sir , `` Your obedient servant and well-wisher , `` Joseph Polwarth . ''
Parsing [sent. 825 len. 10]: Wingfold sat staring at the letter , slightly stunned .
Parsing [sent. 826 len. 39]: The feeling which first grew recognizable in the chaos it had caused , was vexation at having so committed himself ; the next , annoyance with his dead old uncle for having led him into such a scrape .
Parsing [sent. 827 len. 19]: There in the good doctor 's own handwriting lay the sermon , looking nowise different from the rest !
Parsing [sent. 828 len. 8]: Had he forgotten his marks of quotation ?
Parsing [sent. 829 len. 15]: Or to that sermon did he always have a few words of extempore introduction ?
Parsing [sent. 830 len. 13]: For himself he was as ignorant of Jeremy Taylor as of Zoroaster .
Parsing [sent. 831 len. 16]: It could not be that that was his uncle 's mode of making his sermons ?
Parsing [sent. 832 len. 12]: Was it possible they could all be pieces of literary mosaic ?
Parsing [sent. 833 len. 5]: It was very annoying .
Parsing [sent. 834 len. 46]: If the fact came to be known , it would certainly be said that he had attempted to pass off Jeremy Taylor 's for his own -- as if he would have the impudence to make the attempt , and with such a well-known writer !
Parsing [sent. 835 len. 15]: But what difference did it make whether the writer was well or ill known ?
Parsing [sent. 836 len. 13]: None , except as to the relative probabilities of escape and discovery !
Parsing [sent. 837 len. 16]: And should the accusation be brought against him , how was he to answer it ?
Parsing [sent. 838 len. 15]: By burdening the reputation of his departed uncle with the odium of the fault ?
Parsing [sent. 839 len. 18]: Was it worse in his uncle to use Jeremy Taylor than in himself to use his uncle ?
Parsing [sent. 840 len. 10]: Or would his remonstrants accept the translocation of blame ?
Parsing [sent. 841 len. 31]: Would the church-going or chapel-going inhabitants of Glaston remain mute when it came to be discovered that since his appointment he had not once preached a sermon of his own ?
Parsing [sent. 842 len. 25]: How was it that knowing all about it in the background of his mind , he had never come to think of it before ?
Parsing [sent. 843 len. 52]: It was true that , admirer of his uncle as he was , he had never imagined himself reaping any laurels from the credit of his sermons ; it was equally true however that he had not told a single person of the hidden cistern whence he drew his large discourse .
Parsing [sent. 844 len. 23]: But what could it matter to any man , so long as a good sermon was preached , where it came from ?
Parsing [sent. 845 len. 37]: He did not occupy the pulpit in virtue of his personality , but of his office , and it was not a place for the display of originality , but for dispensing the bread of life .
Parsing [sent. 846 len. 8]: -- From the stores of other people ?
Parsing [sent. 847 len. 23]: -- Yes , certainly -- if other people 's bread was better , and no one the worse for his taking it .
Parsing [sent. 848 len. 14]: `` For me , I have none , '' he said to himself .
Parsing [sent. 849 len. 10]: Why then should that letter have made him uncomfortable ?
Parsing [sent. 850 len. 8]: What had he to be ashamed of ?
Parsing [sent. 851 len. 9]: Why should he object to being found out ?
Parsing [sent. 852 len. 7]: What did he want to conceal ?
Parsing [sent. 853 len. 14]: Did not everybody know that very few clergymen really made their own sermons ?
Parsing [sent. 854 len. 38]: Was it not absurd , this mute agreement that , although all men knew to the contrary , it must appear to be taken for granted that a man 's sermons were of his own mental production ?
Parsing [sent. 855 len. 69]: Still more absurd as well as cruel was the way in which they sacrificed to the known falsehood by the contempt they poured upon any fellow the moment they were able to say of productions which never could have been his , that they were by this man or that man , or bought at this shop or that shop in Great Queen Street or Booksellers ' Row .
Parsing [sent. 856 len. 16]: After that he was an enduring object for the pointed finger of a mild scorn .
Parsing [sent. 857 len. 38]: It was nothing but the old Spartan game of -- steal as you will and enjoy as you can : you are nothing the worse ; but woe to you if you are caught in the act !
Parsing [sent. 858 len. 9]: There WAS something contemptible about the whole thing .
Parsing [sent. 859 len. 28]: He was a greater humbug than he had believed himself , for upon this humbug which he now found himself despising he had himself been acting diligently !
Parsing [sent. 860 len. 44]: It dawned upon him that , while there was nothing wrong in preaching his uncle 's sermons , there was evil in yielding to cast any veil , even the most transparent , over the fact that the sermons were not his own .
Parsing [sent. 861 len. 6]: CHAPTER XV THE PARK GATE .
Parsing [sent. 862 len. 25]: He had however one considerate , even friendly parishioner , it seemed , whom it became him at least to thank for his openness .
Parsing [sent. 863 len. 73]: He ceased to pace the room , sat down at his writing-table , and acknowledged Mr. Polwarth 's letter , expressing his obligation for its contents , and saying that he would do himself the honour of calling upon him that afternoon , in the hope of being allowed to say for himself what little could be said , and of receiving counsel in regard to the difficulty wherein he found himself .
Parsing [sent. 864 len. 64]: He sent the note by his land-lady 's boy , and as soon as he had finished his lunch , which meant his dinner , for he could no longer afford to dull his soul in its best time for reading and thinking , he set out to find Park Gate , which he took for some row of dwellings in the suburbs .
Parsing [sent. 865 len. 31]: Going in the direction pointed out , and finding he had left all the houses behind him , he stopped at the gate of Osterfield Park to make further inquiry .
Parsing [sent. 866 len. 47]: The door of the lodge was opened by one whom he took , for the first half second , to be a child , but recognized the next as the same young woman whose book he had picked up in the fields a few months before .
Parsing [sent. 867 len. 22]: He had never seen her since , but her deformity and her face together had made it easy to remember her .
Parsing [sent. 868 len. 33]: `` We have met before , '' he said , in answer to her courtesy and smile , `` and you must now do me a small favour if you can . ''
Parsing [sent. 869 len. 9]: `` I shall be most happy , sir .
Parsing [sent. 870 len. 8]: Please come in , '' she answered .
Parsing [sent. 871 len. 17]: `` I am sorry I can not at this moment , as I have an engagement .
Parsing [sent. 872 len. 14]: Can you tell me where Mr. Polwarth of the Park Gate lives ? ''
Parsing [sent. 873 len. 35]: The girl 's smile of sweetness changed to one of amusement as she repeated , in a gentle voice through which ran a thread of suffering , `` Come in , sir , please .
Parsing [sent. 874 len. 17]: My uncle 's name is Joseph Polwarth , and this is the gate to Osterfield Park .
Parsing [sent. 875 len. 8]: People know it as the Park-gate . ''
Parsing [sent. 876 len. 50]: The house was not one of those trim , modern park-lodges , all angles and peaks , which one sees everywhere now-a-days , but a low cottage , with a very thick , wig-like thatch , into which rose two astonished eyebrows over the stare of two half-awake dormer-windows .
Parsing [sent. 877 len. 24]: On the front of it were young leaves and old hips enough to show that in summer it must be covered with roses .
Parsing [sent. 878 len. 63]: Wingfold entered at once , and followed her through the kitchen , upon which the door immediately opened , a bright place , with stone floor , and shining things on the walls , to a neat little parlour , cozy and rather dark , with a small window to the garden behind , and a smell of last year 's roses .
Parsing [sent. 879 len. 21]: `` My uncle will be here in a few minutes , '' she said , placing a chair for him .
Parsing [sent. 880 len. 19]: `` I would have had a fire here , but my uncle always talks better amongst his books .
Parsing [sent. 881 len. 19]: He expected you , but my lord 's steward sent for him up to the new house . ''
Parsing [sent. 882 len. 14]: He took the chair she offered him , and sat down to wait .
Parsing [sent. 883 len. 42]: He had not much of the gift of making talk -- a questionable accomplishment , -- and he never could approach his so-called inferiors but as his equals , the fact being that in their presence he never felt any difference .
Parsing [sent. 884 len. 31]: Notwithstanding his ignorance of the lore of Christianity , Thomas Wingfold was , in regard to some things , gifted with what I am tempted to call a divine stupidity .
Parsing [sent. 885 len. 37]: Many of the distinctions and privileges after which men follow , and of the annoyances and slights over which they fume , were to the curate inappreciable : he did not and could not see them .
Parsing [sent. 886 len. 14]: `` So you are warders of the gate here , Miss Polwarth ? ''
Parsing [sent. 887 len. 29]: he said , assuming that to be her name , and rightly , when the young woman , who had for a moment left the room , returned .
Parsing [sent. 888 len. 20]: `` Yes , '' she answered , `` we have kept it now for about eight years , sir .
Parsing [sent. 889 len. 7]: -- It is no hard task .
Parsing [sent. 890 len. 18]: But I fancy there will be a little more to do when the house is finished . ''
Parsing [sent. 891 len. 14]: `` It is a long way for you to go to church . ''
Parsing [sent. 892 len. 17]: `` It would be , sir ; but I do not go , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 893 len. 6]: `` Your uncle does . ''
Parsing [sent. 894 len. 8]: `` Not very often , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 895 len. 22]: She left the door open and kept coming and going between the kitchen and the parlour , busy about house affairs .
Parsing [sent. 896 len. 13]: Wingfold sat and watched her as he had opportunity with growing interest .
Parsing [sent. 897 len. 42]: She had the full-sized head that is so often set on a small body , and it looked yet larger from the quantity of rich brown hair upon it -- hair which some ladies would have given their income to possess .
Parsing [sent. 898 len. 21]: Clearly too it gave pleasure to its owner , for it was becomingly as well as carefully and modestly dressed .
Parsing [sent. 899 len. 32]: Her face seemed to Wingfold more interesting every fresh peep he had of it , until at last he pronounced it to himself one of the sweetest he had ever seen .
Parsing [sent. 900 len. 36]: Its prevailing expression was of placidity , and something that was not contentment merely : I would term it satisfaction , were I sure that my reader would call up the very antipode of SELF-satisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 901 len. 15]: And yet there were lines of past and shadows of present suffering upon it .
Parsing [sent. 902 len. 74]: The only sign however that her poor crooked body was not at present totally forgotten , was a slight shy undulation that now and then flickered along the lines of her sensitive mouth , seeming to indicate a shadowy dim-defined thought , or rather feeling , of apology , as if she would disarm prejudice by an expression of sorrow that she could not help the pain and annoyance her unsightliness must occasion .
Parsing [sent. 903 len. 46]: Every feature in her thin face was good , and seemed , individually almost , to speak of a loving spirit , yet he could see ground for suspecting that keen expressions of a quick temper could be no strangers upon those delicately modelled forms .
Parsing [sent. 904 len. 17]: Her hands and feet were both as to size and shape those of a mere child .
Parsing [sent. 905 len. 25]: He was still studying her like a book which a boy reads by stealth , when with slow step her uncle entered the room .
Parsing [sent. 906 len. 8]: Wingfold rose and held out his hand .
Parsing [sent. 907 len. 23]: `` You are welcome , sir , '' said Polwarth , modestly , with the strong grasp of a small firm hand .
Parsing [sent. 908 len. 14]: `` Will you walk upstairs with me , where we shall be undisturbed ?
Parsing [sent. 909 len. 20]: My niece has , I hope , already made my apologies for not being at home to receive you .
Parsing [sent. 910 len. 34]: -- Rachel , my child , will you get us a cup of tea , and by the time it is ready we shall have got through our business , I daresay . ''
Parsing [sent. 911 len. 38]: The face of Wingfold 's host and new friend in expression a good deal resembled that of his niece , but bore traces of yet greater suffering -- bodily , and it might be mental as well .
Parsing [sent. 912 len. 32]: It did not look quite old enough for the whiteness of the plentiful hair that crowned it , and yet there was that in it which might account for the whiteness .
Parsing [sent. 913 len. 84]: His voice was a little dry and husky , streaked as it were with the asthma whose sounds made that big disproportioned chest seem like the cave of the east wind ; but it had a tone of dignity and decision in it , quite in harmony with both matter and style of his letter , and before Wingfold had followed him to the top of the steep narrow straight staircase , all sense of incongruity in him had vanished from his mind .
Parsing [sent. 914 len. 3]: CHAPTER XVI .
Parsing [sent. 915 len. 3]: THE ATTIC .
Parsing [sent. 916 len. 39]: The little man led the way into a tolerably large room , with down-sloping ceiling on both sides , lighted by a small window in the gable , near the fireplace , and a dormer window as well .
Parsing [sent. 917 len. 32]: The low walls , up to the slope , were filled with books ; books lay on the table , on the bed , on chairs , and in corners everywhere .
Parsing [sent. 918 len. 4]: `` Aha ! ''
Parsing [sent. 919 len. 32]: said Wingfold , as he entered and cast his eyes around , `` there is no room for surprise that you should have found me out so easily , Mr. Polwarth !
Parsing [sent. 920 len. 12]: Here you have a legion of detectives for such rascals . ''
Parsing [sent. 921 len. 103]: The little man turned , and for a moment looked at him with a doubtful and somewhat pained expression , as if he had not been prepared for such an entrance on a solemn question ; but a moment 's reading of the curate 's honest face , which by this time had a good deal more print upon it than would have been found there six months agone , sufficed ; the cloud melted into a smile , and he said cordially , `` It is very kind of you , sir , to take my presumption in such good part .
Parsing [sent. 922 len. 6]: Pray sit down , sir .
Parsing [sent. 923 len. 10]: You will find that chair a comfortable one . ''
Parsing [sent. 924 len. 4]: `` Presumption ! ''
Parsing [sent. 925 len. 3]: echoed Wingfold .
Parsing [sent. 926 len. 15]: `` The presumption was all on my part , and the kindness on yours .
Parsing [sent. 927 len. 13]: But you must first hear my explanation , such as it is .
Parsing [sent. 928 len. 41]: It makes the matter hardly a jot the better , only a man would not willingly look worse , or better either , than he is , and besides , we must understand each other if we would be friends .
Parsing [sent. 929 len. 35]: However unlikely it may seem to you , Mr. Polwarth , I really do share the common weakness of wanting to be taken exactly for what I am , neither more nor less . ''
Parsing [sent. 930 len. 23]: `` It is a noble weakness , and far enough from common , I am sorry to think , '' returned Polwarth .
Parsing [sent. 931 len. 20]: The curate then told the gate-keeper of his uncle 's legacy , and his own ignorance of Jeremy Taylor .
Parsing [sent. 932 len. 53]: `` But , '' he concluded , `` since you set me about it , my judgment has capsized itself , and it now seems to me worse to use my uncle 's sermons than to have used the bishop 's , which anyone might discover to be what they are . ''
Parsing [sent. 933 len. 20]: `` I see no harm in either , '' said Polwarth , `` provided only it be above board .
Parsing [sent. 934 len. 12]: I believe some clergymen think the only evil lies in detection .
Parsing [sent. 935 len. 24]: I doubt if they ever escape it , and believe the amount of successful deception in that kind to be very small indeed .
Parsing [sent. 936 len. 24]: Many in a congregation can tell , by a kind of instinct , whether a man be preaching his own sermons or not .
Parsing [sent. 937 len. 49]: But the worse evil appears to me to lie in the tacit understanding that a sermon must SEEM to be a man 's own , although all in the congregation know , and the would-be preacher knows that they know , that it is none of his . ''
Parsing [sent. 938 len. 128]: `` Then you mean , Mr. Polwarth , that I should solemnly acquaint my congregation next Sunday with the fact that the sermon I am about to read to them is one of many left me by my worthy uncle , Jonah Driftwood , D.D. , who , on his death-bed , expressed the hope that I should support their teaching by my example , for , having gone over them some ten or fifteen times in the course of his incumbency , and bettered each every time until he could do no more for it , he did not think , save by my example , I could carry further the enforcement of the truths they contained : -- shall I tell them all that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 939 len. 27]: Polwarth laughed , but with a certain seriousness in his merriment , which however took nothing from its genuineness , indeed seemed rather to add thereto .
Parsing [sent. 940 len. 17]: `` It would hardly be needful to enter so fully into particulars , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 941 len. 44]: `` It would be enough to let them know that you wished it understood between them and you , that you did not profess to teach them anything of yourself , but merely to bring to bear upon them the teaching of others .
Parsing [sent. 942 len. 24]: It would raise complaints and objections , doubtless ; but for that you must be prepared if you would do anything right . ''
Parsing [sent. 943 len. 19]: Wingfold was silent , thoughtful , saying to himself -- `` How straight an honest bow can shoot !
Parsing [sent. 944 len. 7]: -- But this involves something awful .
Parsing [sent. 945 len. 11]: To stand up in that pulpit and speak about myself !
Parsing [sent. 946 len. 21]: I who , even if I had any opinions , could never see reason for presenting them to other people !
Parsing [sent. 947 len. 11]: It 's my office , is it -- not me ?
Parsing [sent. 948 len. 11]: Then I wish my Office would write his own sermons .
Parsing [sent. 949 len. 9]: He can read the prayers well enough ! ''
Parsing [sent. 950 len. 27]: All his life , a little heave of pent-up humour would now and then shake his burden into a more comfortable position upon his bending shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 951 len. 6]: He gave a forlorn laugh .
Parsing [sent. 952 len. 88]: `` But , '' resumed the small man , `` have you never preached a sermon of your own thinking -- I do n't mean of your own making -- one that came out of the commentaries , which are , I am told , the mines whither some of our most noted preachers go to dig for their first inspirations -- but one that came out of your own heart -- your delight in something you had found out , or something you felt much ? ''
Parsing [sent. 953 len. 57]: `` No , '' answered Wingfold ; `` I have nothing , never had anything worth giving to another ; and it would seem to me very unreasonable to subject a helpless congregation to the blundering attempts of such a fellow to put into the forms of reasonable speech things he really knows nothing about . ''
Parsing [sent. 954 len. 29]: `` You must know about some things which it might do them good to be reminded of -- even if they know them already , '' said Polwarth .
Parsing [sent. 955 len. 50]: `` I can not imagine that a man who looks things in the face as you do , the moment they confront you , has not lived at all , has never met with anything in his history which has taught him something other people need to be taught .
Parsing [sent. 956 len. 54]: I profess myself a believer in preaching , and consider that in so far as the church of England has ceased to be a preaching church -- and I do n't call nine-tenths of what goes by the name of it PREACHING -- she has forgotten a mighty part of her high calling .
Parsing [sent. 957 len. 86]: Of course a man to whom no message has been personally given , has no right to take the place of a prophet -- and can not , save by more or less of simulation -- but there is room for teachers as well as prophets , and the more need of teachers that the prophets are so few ; and a man may right honestly be a clergyman who teaches the people , though he may possess none of the gifts of prophecy . ''
Parsing [sent. 958 len. 40]: `` I do not now see well how you are leading me , '' said Wingfold , considerably astonished at both the aptness and fluency with which a man in his host 's position was able to express himself .
Parsing [sent. 959 len. 11]: `` Pray , what do you mean by PROPHECY ? ''
Parsing [sent. 960 len. 26]: `` I mean what I take to be the sense in which St. Paul uses the word -- I mean the highest kind of preaching .
Parsing [sent. 961 len. 50]: But I will come to the point practically : a man , I say , who does not feel in his soul that he has something to tell his people , should straightway turn his energy to the providing of such food for them as he finds feed himself .
Parsing [sent. 962 len. 25]: In other words , if he has nothing new in his own treasure , let him bring something old out of another man 's .
Parsing [sent. 963 len. 53]: If his own soul is unfed , he can hardly be expected to find food for other people , and has no business in any pulpit , but ought to betake himself to some other employment -- whatever he may have been predestined to -- I mean , made fit for . ''
Parsing [sent. 964 len. 20]: `` Then do you intend that a man SHOULD make up his sermons from the books he reads ? ''
Parsing [sent. 965 len. 10]: `` Yes , if he can not do better .
Parsing [sent. 966 len. 24]: But then I would have him read -- not with his sermon in his eye , but with his people in his heart .
Parsing [sent. 967 len. 106]: Men in business and professions have so little time for reading or thinking -- and idle people have still less -- that their means of grace , as the theologians say , are confined to discipline without nourishment , whence their religion , if they have any , is often from mere atrophy but a skeleton ; and the office of preaching is , after all , to wake them up lest their sleep turn to death ; next , to make them hungry , and lastly , to supply that hunger ; and for all these things , the pastor has to take thought .
Parsing [sent. 968 len. 19]: If he feed not the flock of God , then is he an hireling and no shepherd . ''
Parsing [sent. 969 len. 25]: At this moment , Rachel entered with a small tea-tray : she could carry only little things , and a few at a time .
Parsing [sent. 970 len. 58]: She cast a glance of almost loving solicitude at the young man who now sat before her uncle with head bowed , and self-abasement on his honest countenance , then a look almost of expostulation at her uncle , as if interceding for a culprit , and begging the master not to be too hard upon him .
Parsing [sent. 971 len. 26]: But the little man smiled -- such a sweet smile of re-assurance , that her face returned at once to its prevailing expression of content .
Parsing [sent. 972 len. 21]: She cleared a place on the table , set down her tray , and went to bring cups and saucers .
Parsing [sent. 973 len. 3]: CHAPTER XVII .
Parsing [sent. 974 len. 4]: POLWARTH 'S PLAN .
Parsing [sent. 975 len. 24]: `` I think I understand you now , '' said Wingfold , after the little pause occasioned by the young woman 's entrance .
Parsing [sent. 976 len. 18]: `` You would have a man who can not be original , deal honestly in second-hand goods .
Parsing [sent. 977 len. 25]: Or perhaps rather , he should say to the congregation -- ` This is not home-made bread I offer you , but something better .
Parsing [sent. 978 len. 11]: I got it from this or that baker 's shop .
Parsing [sent. 979 len. 19]: I have eaten of it myself , and it has agreed well with me and done me good .
Parsing [sent. 980 len. 18]: If you chew it well , I do n't doubt you also will find it good . '
Parsing [sent. 981 len. 14]: -- Is that something like what you would have , Mr. Polwarth ? ''
Parsing [sent. 982 len. 8]: `` Precisely , '' answered the gate-keeper .
Parsing [sent. 983 len. 24]: `` But , '' he added , after a moment 's delay , `` I should be sorry if you stopped there . ''
Parsing [sent. 984 len. 5]: `` Stopped there ! ''
Parsing [sent. 985 len. 3]: echoed Wingfold .
Parsing [sent. 986 len. 10]: `` The question is whether I can begin there .
Parsing [sent. 987 len. 16]: You have no idea how ignorant I am -- how little I have read ! ''
Parsing [sent. 988 len. 11]: `` I have some idea of both , I fancy .
Parsing [sent. 989 len. 21]: I must have known considerably less than you at your age , for I was never at a university . ''
Parsing [sent. 990 len. 22]: `` But perhaps even then you had more of the knowledge which , they say , life only can give . ''
Parsing [sent. 991 len. 9]: `` I have it now at all events .
Parsing [sent. 992 len. 11]: But of that everyone has enough who lives his life .
Parsing [sent. 993 len. 26]: Those who gain no experience are those who shirk the king 's highway , for fear of encountering the Duty seated by the roadside . ''
Parsing [sent. 994 len. 17]: `` You ought to be a clergyman yourself , sir , '' said Wingfold , humbly .
Parsing [sent. 995 len. 22]: `` How is it that such as I -- '' Here he checked himself , knowing something of how it was .
Parsing [sent. 996 len. 21]: `` I hope I ought to be just what I am , neither more nor less , '' replied Polwarth .
Parsing [sent. 997 len. 33]: `` As to being a clergyman , Moses had a better idea about such things , at least so far as concerns outsides , than you seem to have , Mr. Wingfold .
Parsing [sent. 998 len. 28]: He would never have let a man who in size and shape is a mere mockery of the human , stand up to minister to the congregation .
Parsing [sent. 999 len. 36]: But if you will let me help you , I shall be most grateful ; for of late I have been oppressed with the thought that I serve no one but myself and my niece .
Parsing [sent. 1000 len. 16]: I am in mortal fear of growing selfish under the weight of my privileges . ''
Parsing [sent. 1001 len. 20]: A fit of asthmatic coughing seized him , and grew in severity until he seemed struggling for his life .
Parsing [sent. 1002 len. 43]: It was at the worst when his niece entered , but she showed no alarm , only concern , and did nothing but go up to him and lay her hand on his back between his shoulders till the fit was over .
Parsing [sent. 1003 len. 13]: The instant the convulsion ceased , its pain dissolved in a smile .
Parsing [sent. 1004 len. 14]: Wingfold uttered some lame expressions of regret that he should suffer so much .
Parsing [sent. 1005 len. 22]: `` It is really nothing to distress you , or me either , Mr. Wingfold , '' said the little man .
Parsing [sent. 1006 len. 16]: `` Shall we have a cup of tea , and then resume our talk ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1007 len. 54]: `` The fact , I find , Mr. Polwarth , '' said the curate , giving the result of what had been passing through his mind , and too absorbed in that to reply to the invitation , `` is , that I must not , and indeed can not give you half-confidences .
Parsing [sent. 1008 len. 45]: I will tell you all that troubles me , for it is plain that you know something of which I am ignorant , -- something which , I have great hopes , will turn out to be the very thing I need to know .
Parsing [sent. 1009 len. 4]: May I speak ?
Parsing [sent. 1010 len. 9]: Will you let me talk about myself ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1011 len. 34]: `` I am entirely at your service , Mr. Wingfold , '' returned Polwarth , and seeing the curate did not touch his tea , placed his own cup again on the table .
Parsing [sent. 1012 len. 36]: The young woman got down like a child from the chair upon which she had perched herself at the table , and with a kind look at Wingfold , was about to leave the room .
Parsing [sent. 1013 len. 9]: `` No , no , Miss Polwarth ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1014 len. 31]: said the curate , rising ; `` I shall not be able to go on if I feel that I have sent you away -- and your tea untouched too !
Parsing [sent. 1015 len. 9]: What a selfish and ungrateful fellow I am !
Parsing [sent. 1016 len. 12]: I did not even observe that you had given me tea !
Parsing [sent. 1017 len. 15]: But you would pardon me if you knew what I have been going through .
Parsing [sent. 1018 len. 19]: If you do n't mind staying , we can talk and drink our tea at the same time .
Parsing [sent. 1019 len. 18]: I am very fond of tea , when it is so good as I see yours is .
Parsing [sent. 1020 len. 16]: I only fear I may have to say some things that will shock you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1021 len. 22]: `` I will stay till then , '' replied Rachel , with a smile , and climbed again upon her chair .
Parsing [sent. 1022 len. 7]: `` I am not much afraid .
Parsing [sent. 1023 len. 27]: My uncle says things sometimes fit to make a Pharisee 's hair stand on his head , but somehow they make my heart burn inside me .
Parsing [sent. 1024 len. 7]: -- May I stop , uncle ?
Parsing [sent. 1025 len. 8]: -- I should like so much ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1026 len. 18]: `` Certainly , my child , if Mr. Wingfold will not feel your presence a restraint . ''
Parsing [sent. 1027 len. 11]: `` Not in the least , '' said the curate .
Parsing [sent. 1028 len. 15]: Miss Polwarth helped them to bread and butter , and a brief silence followed .
Parsing [sent. 1029 len. 27]: `` I was brought up to the church , '' said Wingfold at length , playing with his teaspoon , and looking down on the table .
Parsing [sent. 1030 len. 29]: `` It 's an awful shame such a thing should have been , but I do n't find out that anybody in particular was to blame for it .
Parsing [sent. 1031 len. 13]: Things are all wrong that way , in general , I doubt .
Parsing [sent. 1032 len. 87]: I pass my examinations with decency , distinguish myself in nothing , go before the bishop , am admitted a deacon , after a year am ordained a priest , and after another year or two of false preaching and of parish work , suddenly find myself curate in charge of a grand old abbey church ; but as to what the whole thing means in practical relation with myself as a human being , I am as ignorant as Simon Magus , without his excuse .
Parsing [sent. 1033 len. 5]: Do not mistake me .
Parsing [sent. 1034 len. 24]: I think I could stand an examination on the doctrines of the church , as contained in the articles , and prayer-book generally .
Parsing [sent. 1035 len. 20]: But for all they have done for me , I might as well have never heard of them . ''
Parsing [sent. 1036 len. 12]: `` Do n't be quite sure of that , Mr. Wingfold .
Parsing [sent. 1037 len. 17]: At least , they have brought you to inquire if there be anything in them . ''
Parsing [sent. 1038 len. 21]: `` Mr. Polwarth , '' returned Wingfold abruptly , `` I can not even prove there is a God ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1039 len. 23]: `` But the church of England exists for the sake of teaching Christianity , not proving that there is a God . ''
Parsing [sent. 1040 len. 8]: `` What is Christianity , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1041 len. 11]: `` God in Christ , and Christ in man . ''
Parsing [sent. 1042 len. 14]: `` What is the use of that if there be no God ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1043 len. 5]: `` None whatever . ''
Parsing [sent. 1044 len. 13]: `` Mr. Polwarth , can you prove there is a God ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1045 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 1046 len. 40]: `` Then if you do n't believe there is a God -- I do n't know what is to become of me , '' said the curate , in a tone of deep disappointment , and rose to go .
Parsing [sent. 1047 len. 46]: `` Mr. Wingfold , '' said the little man , with a smile and a deep breath as of delight at the thought that was moving in him , `` I know him in my heart , and he is all in all to me .
Parsing [sent. 1048 len. 21]: You did not ask whether I believed in him , but whether I could prove that there was a God .
Parsing [sent. 1049 len. 25]: As well ask a fly , which has not yet crawled about the world , if he can prove that it is round ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1050 len. 18]: `` Pardon me , and have patience with me , '' said Wingfold , resuming his seat .
Parsing [sent. 1051 len. 6]: `` I am a fool .
Parsing [sent. 1052 len. 10]: But it is life or death to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1053 len. 9]: `` I would we were all such fools !
Parsing [sent. 1054 len. 25]: -- But please ask me no more questions ; or ask me as many as you will , but expect no answers just yet .
Parsing [sent. 1055 len. 11]: I want to know more of your mind first . ''
Parsing [sent. 1056 len. 14]: `` Well , I will ask questions , but press for no answers .
Parsing [sent. 1057 len. 26]: -- If you can not prove there is a God , do you know for certain that such a one as Jesus Christ ever lived ?
Parsing [sent. 1058 len. 8]: Can it be proved with positive certainty ?
Parsing [sent. 1059 len. 29]: I say nothing of what they call the doctrines of Christianity , or the authority of the church , or the sacraments , or anything of that sort .
Parsing [sent. 1060 len. 11]: Such questions are at present of no interest to me .
Parsing [sent. 1061 len. 45]: And yet the fact that they do not interest me , were enough to prove me in as false and despicable a position as ever man found himself occupying -- as arrant a hypocrite and deceiver as any god-personating priest in the Delphic temple .
Parsing [sent. 1062 len. 29]: -- I had rather a man despised than excused me , Mr. Polwarth , for I am at issue with myself , and love not my past . ''
Parsing [sent. 1063 len. 9]: `` I shall do neither , Mr. Wingfold .
Parsing [sent. 1064 len. 9]: Go on , if you please , sir .
Parsing [sent. 1065 len. 12]: I am more deeply interested than I can tell you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1066 len. 42]: `` Some few months ago then , I met a young man who takes for granted the opposite of all that I had up to that time taken for granted , and which now I want to be able to prove .
Parsing [sent. 1067 len. 8]: He spoke with contempt of my profession .
Parsing [sent. 1068 len. 15]: I could not defend my profession , and of course had to despise myself .
Parsing [sent. 1069 len. 5]: I began to think .
Parsing [sent. 1070 len. 14]: I began to pray -- if you will excuse me for mentioning it .
Parsing [sent. 1071 len. 26]: My whole past life appeared like the figures that glide over the field of a camera obscura -- not an abiding fact in it all .
Parsing [sent. 1072 len. 12]: A cloud gathered about me , and hangs about me still .
Parsing [sent. 1073 len. 21]: I call , but no voice answers me out of the darkness , and at times I am in despair .
Parsing [sent. 1074 len. 46]: I would , for the love and peace of honesty , give up the profession , but I shrink from forsaking what I may yet possibly find -- though I fear , I fear -- to be as true as I wish to find it .
Parsing [sent. 1075 len. 39]: Something , I know not what , holds me to it -- some dim vague affection , possibly mere prejudice , aided by a love for music , and the other sweet sounds of our prayers and responses .
Parsing [sent. 1076 len. 29]: Nor would I willingly be supposed to deny what I dare not say -- indeed know not how to say I believe , not knowing what it is .
Parsing [sent. 1077 len. 25]: I should nevertheless have abandoned everything months ago , had I not felt bound by my agreement to serve my rector for a year .
Parsing [sent. 1078 len. 28]: You are the only one of the congregation who has shown me any humanity , and I beg of you to be my friend and help me .
Parsing [sent. 1079 len. 5]: What shall I do ?
Parsing [sent. 1080 len. 26]: After the avowal you have made , I may well ask you again , How am I to know that there is a God ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1081 len. 29]: `` It were a more pertinent question , sir , '' returned Polwarth , -- `` If there be a God , how am I to find him ?
Parsing [sent. 1082 len. 39]: -- And , as I hinted before , there is another question -- one you have already put -- more pertinent to your position as an English clergyman : Was there ever such a man as Jesus Christ ?
Parsing [sent. 1083 len. 21]: -- Those , I think , were your own words : what do you mean by SUCH a man ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1084 len. 12]: `` Such as he is represented in the New Testament . ''
Parsing [sent. 1085 len. 14]: `` From that representation , what description would you give of him now ?
Parsing [sent. 1086 len. 5]: What is that SUCH ?
Parsing [sent. 1087 len. 25]: What sort of person , supposing the story true , would you take this Jesus , from that story , to have been ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1088 len. 6]: Wingfold thought for a while .
Parsing [sent. 1089 len. 14]: `` I am a worse humbug than I fancied , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1090 len. 9]: `` I can not tell what he was .
Parsing [sent. 1091 len. 27]: My thoughts of him are so vague and indistinct that it would take me a long time to render myself able to answer your question . ''
Parsing [sent. 1092 len. 10]: `` Perhaps longer still than you think , sir .
Parsing [sent. 1093 len. 8]: It took me a very long time .
Parsing [sent. 1094 len. 5]: -- '' CHAPTER XVIII .
Parsing [sent. 1095 len. 3]: JOSEPH POLWARTH .
Parsing [sent. 1096 len. 30]: `` Shall I tell you , '' the gate-keeper went on , `` something of my life , in return of the confidence you have honoured me with ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1097 len. 13]: `` Nothing could be more to my mind , '' answered Wingfold .
Parsing [sent. 1098 len. 31]: `` And I trust , '' he added , `` it is no unworthy curiosity that makes me anxious to understand how you have come to know so much . ''
Parsing [sent. 1099 len. 16]: `` Indeed it is not that I know much , '' said the little man .
Parsing [sent. 1100 len. 14]: `` On the contrary I am the most ignorant person of my acquaintance .
Parsing [sent. 1101 len. 12]: You would be astonished to discover what I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 1102 len. 12]: But the thing is that I know what is worth knowing .
Parsing [sent. 1103 len. 25]: Yet I get not a crumb more than my daily bread by it -- I mean the bread by which the inner man lives .
Parsing [sent. 1104 len. 53]: The man who gives himself to making money , will seldom fail of becoming a rich man ; and it would be hard if a man who gave himself to find wherewithal to still the deepest cravings of his best self , should not be able to find that bread of life .
Parsing [sent. 1105 len. 65]: I tried to make a little money by book-selling once : I failed -- not to pay my debts , but to make the money ; I could not go into it heartily , or give it thought enough , so it was all right I should not succeed ; but what I did and do make my object , does not disappoint me .
Parsing [sent. 1106 len. 21]: `` My ancestors , as my name indicates , were of and in Cornwall , where they held large property .
Parsing [sent. 1107 len. 20]: Forgive the seeming boast -- it is but fact , and can reflect little enough on one like me .
Parsing [sent. 1108 len. 24]: Scorn and pain mingled with mighty hope is a grand prescription for weaning the heart from the judgments and aspirations of this world .
Parsing [sent. 1109 len. 40]: Later ancestors were , not many generations ago , the proprietors of this very property of Osterfield , which the uncle of the present Lord de Barre bought , and to which I , their descendant , am gate-keeper .
Parsing [sent. 1110 len. 15]: What with gambling , drinking , and worse , they deserved to lose it .
Parsing [sent. 1111 len. 17]: The results of their lawlessness are ours : we are what and where you see us .
Parsing [sent. 1112 len. 11]: With the inherited poison , the Father gave the antidote .
Parsing [sent. 1113 len. 32]: Rachel , my child , am I not right when I say that you thank God with me for having THUS visited the iniquities of the fathers upon the children ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1114 len. 27]: `` I do , uncle ; you know I do -- from the bottom of my heart , '' replied Rachel in a low tender voice .
Parsing [sent. 1115 len. 44]: A great solemnity came upon the spirit of Wingfold , and for a moment he felt as if he sat wrapt in a cloud of sacred marvel , beyond and around which lay a gulf of music too perfect to touch his sense .
Parsing [sent. 1116 len. 20]: But presently Polwarth resumed : `` My father was in appearance a remarkably fine man , tall and stately .
Parsing [sent. 1117 len. 8]: Of him I have little to say .
Parsing [sent. 1118 len. 14]: If he did not do well , my grandfather must be censured first .
Parsing [sent. 1119 len. 9]: He had a sister very like Rachel here .
Parsing [sent. 1120 len. 4]: Poor Aunt Lottie !
Parsing [sent. 1121 len. 10]: She was not so happy as my little one .
Parsing [sent. 1122 len. 19]: My brothers were all fine men like himself , yet they all died young except my brother Robert .
Parsing [sent. 1123 len. 17]: He too is dead now , thank God , and I trust he is in peace .
Parsing [sent. 1124 len. 14]: I had almost begun to fear with himself that he would never die .
Parsing [sent. 1125 len. 7]: And yet he was but fifty .
Parsing [sent. 1126 len. 12]: He left me my Rachel with her twenty pounds a year .
Parsing [sent. 1127 len. 19]: I have thirty of my own , and this cottage we have rent-free for attending to the gate .
Parsing [sent. 1128 len. 11]: I shall tell you more about my brother some day .
Parsing [sent. 1129 len. 13]: There are none of the family left now but myself and Rachel .
Parsing [sent. 1130 len. 11]: God in his mercy is about to let it cease .
Parsing [sent. 1131 len. 27]: `` I was sent to one of our smaller public schools -- mainly , I believe , because I was an eyesore to my handsome father .
Parsing [sent. 1132 len. 43]: There I made , I fancy , about as good a beginning as wretched health , and the miseries of a sensitive nature , ever conscious of exposure , without mother or home to hide its feebleness and deformity , would permit .
Parsing [sent. 1133 len. 9]: For then first I felt myself an outcast .
Parsing [sent. 1134 len. 25]: I was the butt of all the coarser-minded of my schoolfellows , and the kindness of some could but partially make up for it .
Parsing [sent. 1135 len. 52]: On the other hand , I had no haunting and irritating sense of wrong , such as I believe not a few of my fellows in deformity feel -- no burning indignation , or fierce impulse to retaliate on those who injured me , or on the society that scorned me .
Parsing [sent. 1136 len. 57]: The isolation that belonged to my condition wrought indeed to the intensifying of my individuality , but that again intensified my consciousness of need more than of wrong , until the passion blossomed almost into assurance , and at length I sought even with agony the aid to which my wretchedness seemed to have a right .
Parsing [sent. 1137 len. 27]: My longing was mainly for a refuge , for some corner into which I might creep , where I should be concealed and so at rest .
Parsing [sent. 1138 len. 27]: The sole triumph I coveted over my persecutors was to know that they could not find me -- that I had a friend stronger than they .
Parsing [sent. 1139 len. 21]: It is no wonder I should not remember when I began to pray , and hope that God heard me .
Parsing [sent. 1140 len. 21]: I used to fancy to myself that I lay in his hand and peeped through his fingers at my foes .
Parsing [sent. 1141 len. 20]: That was at night , for my deformity brought me one blessed comfort -- that I had no bedfellow .
Parsing [sent. 1142 len. 41]: This I felt at first as both a sad deprivation and a painful rejection , but I learned to pray the sooner for the loneliness , and the heartier from the solitude which was as a chamber with closed door .
Parsing [sent. 1143 len. 28]: `` I do not know what I might have taken to had I been made like other people , or what plans my mother cherished for me .
Parsing [sent. 1144 len. 39]: But it soon became evident , as time passed and I grew no taller but more mis-shapen , that to bring me up to a profession would be but to render my deformity the more painful to myself .
Parsing [sent. 1145 len. 35]: I spent , therefore , the first three years after I left school at home , keeping out of my father 's way as much as possible , and cleaving fast to my mother .
Parsing [sent. 1146 len. 15]: When she died , she left her little property between me and my brother .
Parsing [sent. 1147 len. 16]: He had been brought up to my father 's profession -- that of an engineer .
Parsing [sent. 1148 len. 23]: My father could not touch the principal of this money , but neither , while he lived , could we the interest .
Parsing [sent. 1149 len. 25]: I hardly know how I lived for the next three or four years -- it must have been almost on charity , I think .
Parsing [sent. 1150 len. 32]: My father was never at home , and but for the old woman who had been our only attendant all my life , I think very likely I should have starved .
Parsing [sent. 1151 len. 31]: I spent my time mostly in reading -- whatever I could lay my hands upon -- and that not carelessly , but with such reflection as I was capable of .
Parsing [sent. 1152 len. 71]: One thing I may mention , as showing how I was still carried in the same direction as before -- that , without any natural turn for handicraft , I constructed for myself a secret place of carpenter 's work in a corner of the garret , small indeed , but big enough for a couch on which I could lie , and a table as long as the couch .
Parsing [sent. 1153 len. 6]: That was all the furniture .
Parsing [sent. 1154 len. 20]: The walls were lined from top to bottom with books , mostly gathered from those lying about the house .
Parsing [sent. 1155 len. 19]: Cunningly was the entrance to this nest contrived : I doubt if anyone may have found it yet .
Parsing [sent. 1156 len. 21]: If some imaginative , dreamy boy has come upon it , what a find it must have been to him !
Parsing [sent. 1157 len. 7]: I could envy him the pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 1158 len. 13]: There I always went to say my prayers and read my bible .
Parsing [sent. 1159 len. 55]: But sometimes The Arabian Nights , or some other book of entrancing human invention , would come between , and make me neglect both , and then I would feel bad and forsaken ; -- for as yet I knew little of the heart to which I cried for shelter and warmth and defence .
Parsing [sent. 1160 len. 19]: `` Somewhere in this time at length , I began to feel dissatisfied , even displeased with myself .
Parsing [sent. 1161 len. 42]: At first the feeling was vague , altogether undefined -- a mere sense that I did not fit into things , that I was not what I ought to be , what was somehow and by the Authority required of me .
Parsing [sent. 1162 len. 20]: This went on , began to gather roots rather than send them out , grew towards something more definite .
Parsing [sent. 1163 len. 33]: I began to be aware that , heavy affliction as it was to be made so different from my fellows , my outward deformity was but a picture of my inward condition .
Parsing [sent. 1164 len. 5]: There nothing was right .
Parsing [sent. 1165 len. 34]: Many things which in theory I condemned , and in others despised , were yet a part of myself , or , at best , part of evil disease cleaving fast unto me .
Parsing [sent. 1166 len. 9]: I found myself envious and revengeful and conceited .
Parsing [sent. 1167 len. 16]: I discovered that I looked down on people whom I thought less clever than myself .
Parsing [sent. 1168 len. 27]: Once I caught myself scorning a young fellow to whose disadvantage I knew nothing , except that God had made him handsome enough for a woman .
Parsing [sent. 1169 len. 142]: All at once one day , with a sickening conviction it came upon me -- with one of those sudden slackenings of the cord of self-consciousness , in which it doubles back quivering , and seems to break , while the man for an instant beholds his individuality apart from himself , is generally frightened at it , and always disgusted -- a strange and indeed awful experience , which if it lasted longer than its allotted moment , might well drive a man mad who had no God to whom to offer back his individuality , in appeal against his double consciousness -- it was in one of these cataleptic fits of the spirit , I say , that I first saw plainly what a contemptible little wretch I was , and writhed in the bright agony of conscious worthlessness .
Parsing [sent. 1170 len. 44]: `` I now concluded that I had been nothing but a pharisee and a hypocrite , praying with a bad heart , and that God saw me just as detestable as I saw myself , and despised me and was angry with me .
Parsing [sent. 1171 len. 28]: I read my bible more diligently than ever for a time , found in it nothing but denunciation and wrath , and soon dropped it in despair .
Parsing [sent. 1172 len. 7]: I had already ceased to pray .
Parsing [sent. 1173 len. 9]: `` One day a little boy mocked me .
Parsing [sent. 1174 len. 23]: I flew into a rage , and , rendered by passion for the moment fleet and strong , pursued and caught him .
Parsing [sent. 1175 len. 26]: Whatever may be a man 's condition of defence against evil , I have learnt that he can not keep the good out of him .
Parsing [sent. 1176 len. 85]: When the boy found himself in my clutches , he turned on me a look of such terror that it disarmed me at once , and , confounded and distressed to see a human being in such abject fear , a state which in my own experience I knew to be horrible , ashamed also that it should be before such a one as myself , I would have let him go instantly , but that I could not without first having comforted him .
Parsing [sent. 1177 len. 45]: But not a word of mine could get into his ears , and I saw at length that he was so PRE-possessed , that every tone of kindness I uttered , sounded to him a threat : nothing would do but let him go .
Parsing [sent. 1178 len. 40]: The moment he found himself free , he fled headlong into the pond , got out again , ran home , and told , with perfect truthfulness I believe , though absolute inaccuracy , that I threw him in .
Parsing [sent. 1179 len. 50]: After this I tried to govern my temper , but found that the more I tried , the more even that I succeeded outwardly , that is , succeeded in suppressing the signs and deeds of wrath , the less could I keep down the wrath in my soul .
Parsing [sent. 1180 len. 30]: I then tried never to think about myself at all , and read and read -- not the bible -- more and more , in order to forget myself .
Parsing [sent. 1181 len. 49]: But ever through all my reading and thinking I was aware of the lack of harmony at the heart of me : I was not that which it was well to be ; I was not at peace ; I lacked ; was distorted ; I was sick .
Parsing [sent. 1182 len. 9]: Such were my feelings , not my reflections .
Parsing [sent. 1183 len. 19]: All that time is as the memory of an unlovely dream -- a dream of confusion and pain .
Parsing [sent. 1184 len. 32]: `` One evening , in the twilight , I lay alone in my little den , not thinking , but with mind surrendered and passive to what might come into it .
Parsing [sent. 1185 len. 8]: It was very hot -- indeed sultry .
Parsing [sent. 1186 len. 14]: My little skylight was open , but not a breath of air entered .
Parsing [sent. 1187 len. 58]: What preceded I do not know , but the face of the terrified boy rose before me , or in me rather , and all at once I found myself eagerly , painfully , at length almost in an agony , persuading him that I would not hurt him , but meant well and friendlily towards him .
Parsing [sent. 1188 len. 39]: Again I had just let him go in despair , when the sweetest , gentlest , most refreshing little waft of air came in at the window and just went BEING , hardly moving , over my forehead .
Parsing [sent. 1189 len. 20]: Its greeting was more delicate than even my mother 's kiss , and yet it cooled my whole body .
Parsing [sent. 1190 len. 61]: Now whatever , or whencesoever the link , if any be supposed needful to account for the fact , it kept below in the secret places of the springs , for I saw it not ; but the next thought of which I was aware was -- What if I misunderstood God the same way the boy had misunderstood me !
Parsing [sent. 1191 len. 21]: and the next thing was to take my New Testament from the shelf on which I had laid it aside .
Parsing [sent. 1192 len. 24]: `` Another evening of that same summer , I said to myself that I would begin at the beginning and read it through .
Parsing [sent. 1193 len. 23]: I had no definite idea in the resolve ; it seemed a good thing to do , and I would do it .
Parsing [sent. 1194 len. 15]: It would serve towards keeping up my connection in a way with THINGS ABOVE .
Parsing [sent. 1195 len. 17]: I began , but did not that night get through the first chapter of St. Matthew .
Parsing [sent. 1196 len. 45]: Conscientiously I read every word of the genealogy , but when I came to the twenty-third verse and read : ` Thou shalt call his name Jesus ; FOR HE SHALL SAVE HIS PEOPLE FROM THEIR SINS , ' I fell on my knees .
Parsing [sent. 1197 len. 16]: No system of theology had come between me and a common-sense reading of the book .
Parsing [sent. 1198 len. 24]: I did not for a moment imagine that to be saved from my sins meant to be saved from the punishment of them .
Parsing [sent. 1199 len. 10]: That would have been no glad tidings to me .
Parsing [sent. 1200 len. 27]: My sinfulness was ever before me , and often my sins too , and I loved them not , yet could not free myself of them .
Parsing [sent. 1201 len. 36]: They were in me and of me , and how was I to part myself from that which came to me with my consciousness , which asserted itself in me as one with my consciousness ?
Parsing [sent. 1202 len. 13]: I could not get behind myself so as to reach its root .
Parsing [sent. 1203 len. 27]: But here was news of one who came from behind that root itself to deliver me from that in me which made being a bad thing !
Parsing [sent. 1204 len. 5]: Ah , Mr. Wingfold !
Parsing [sent. 1205 len. 63]: what if , after all the discoveries made , and all the theories set up and pulled down , amid all the commonplaces men call common sense , notwithstanding all the over-powering and excluding self-assertion of things that are seen , ever crying , ` Here we are , and save us there is nothing : the Unseen is the Unreal ! '
Parsing [sent. 1206 len. 31]: -- what if , I say , notwithstanding all this , it should yet be that the strongest weapon a man can wield is prayer to one who made him !
Parsing [sent. 1207 len. 51]: What if the man who lifts up his heart to the unknown God even , be entering , amid the mockery of men who worship what they call natural law and science , into the region whence issues every law , and where the very material of science is born !
Parsing [sent. 1208 len. 22]: `` To tell you all that followed , if I could recall and narrate it in order , would take hours .
Parsing [sent. 1209 len. 14]: Suffice it that from that moment I was a student , a disciple .
Parsing [sent. 1210 len. 22]: Soon to me also came then the two questions : HOW DO I KNOW THAT THERE IS A GOD AT ALL ?
Parsing [sent. 1211 len. 16]: and -- HOW AM I TO KNOW THAT SUCH A MAN AS JESUS EVERY LIVED ?
Parsing [sent. 1212 len. 5]: I could answer neither .
Parsing [sent. 1213 len. 36]: But in the meantime I was reading the story -- was drawn to the man there presented -- and was trying to understand his being , and character , and principles of life and action .
Parsing [sent. 1214 len. 55]: And , to sum all in a word , many months had not passed ere I had forgotten to seek an answer to either question : they were in fact questions no longer : I had seen the man Christ Jesus , and in him had known the Father of him and of me .
Parsing [sent. 1215 len. 34]: My dear sir , no conviction can be got , or if it could be got , would be of any sufficing value , through that dealer in second-hand goods , the intellect .
Parsing [sent. 1216 len. 36]: If by it we could prove there is a God , it would be of small avail indeed : we must see him and know him , to know that he was not a demon .
Parsing [sent. 1217 len. 69]: But I know no other way of knowing that there is a God but that which reveals WHAT he is -- the only idea that could be God -- shows him in his own self-proving existence -- and that way is Jesus Christ as he revealed himself on earth , and as he is revealed afresh to every heart that seeks to know the truth concerning him . ''
Parsing [sent. 1218 len. 100]: A pause followed , a solemn one , and then again Polwarth spoke : `` Either the whole frame of existence , '' he said , `` is a wretched , miserable unfitness , a chaos with dreams of a world , a chaos in which the higher is for ever subject to the lower , or it is an embodied idea growing towards perfection in him who is the one perfect creative Idea , the Father of lights , who suffers himself that he may bring his many sons into the glory which is his own glory . ''
Parsing [sent. 1219 len. 3]: CHAPTER XIX .
Parsing [sent. 1220 len. 7]: THE CONCLUSION OF THE WHOLE MATTER .
Parsing [sent. 1221 len. 58]: `` But , '' said Wingfold -- `` only pray do not think I am opposing you ; I am in the straits you have left so far behind : how am I to know that I should not merely have wrought myself up to the believing of that which I should like to be true ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1222 len. 22]: `` Leave that question , my dear sir , until you know what that really is which you want to believe .
Parsing [sent. 1223 len. 37]: I do not imagine that you have more than the merest glimmer of the nature of that concerning which you , for the very reason that you know not what it is , most rationally doubt .
Parsing [sent. 1224 len. 30]: Is a man to refuse to withdraw his curtains lest some flash in his own eyes should deceive him with a vision of morning while yet it is night ?
Parsing [sent. 1225 len. 39]: The truth to the soul is as light to the eyes : you may be deceived , and mistake something else for light , but you can never fail to know the light when it really comes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1226 len. 9]: `` What then would you have of me ?
Parsing [sent. 1227 len. 8]: -- what am I to DO ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1228 len. 30]: said Wingfold , who , having found his master , was docile as a child , but had not laid firm enough hold upon what he had last said .
Parsing [sent. 1229 len. 82]: `` I repeat , '' said Polwarth , `` that the community whose servant you are was not founded to promulgate or defend the doctrine of the existence of a Deity , but to perpetuate the assertion of a man that he was the son and only revealer of the Father of men , a fact , if it be a fact , which precludes the question of the existence of a God , because it includes the answer to it .
Parsing [sent. 1230 len. 50]: Your business , therefore , even as one who finds himself in your unfortunate position as a clergyman , is to make yourself acquainted with that man : he will be to you nobody save in revealing , through knowledge of his inmost heart , the Father to you .
Parsing [sent. 1231 len. 21]: Take then your New Testament as if you had never seen it before , and read -- to find out .
Parsing [sent. 1232 len. 27]: If in him you fail to meet God , then go to your consciousness of the race , your metaphysics , your Plato , your Spinosa .
Parsing [sent. 1233 len. 33]: Till then , this point remains : there was a man who said he knew him , and that if you would give heed to him , you too should know him .
Parsing [sent. 1234 len. 59]: The record left of him is indeed scanty , yet enough to disclose what manner of man he was -- his principles , his ways of looking at things , his thoughts of his Father and his brethren and the relations between them , of man 's business in life , his destiny , and his hopes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1235 len. 20]: `` I see plainly , '' answered the curate , `` that what you say , I must do .
Parsing [sent. 1236 len. 15]: But how , while on duty as a clergyman , I DO NOT KNOW .
Parsing [sent. 1237 len. 109]: How am I , with the sense of the unreality of my position ever growing upon me , and my utter inability to supply the wants of the congregation , save from my uncle 's store of dry provender , which it takes me a great part of my time so to modify as , in using it , to avoid direct lying -- with all this pressing upon me , and making me restless and irritable and self-contemptuous , how AM I to set myself to such solemn work , wherein a man must surely be clear-eyed and single-hearted , if he would succeed in his quest ?
Parsing [sent. 1238 len. 8]: -- I must resign my curacy . ''
Parsing [sent. 1239 len. 6]: Mr. Polwarth thought a little .
Parsing [sent. 1240 len. 25]: `` It would be well , I think , to retain it for a time at least while you search , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1241 len. 17]: `` If you do not within a month see prospect of finding him , then resign .
Parsing [sent. 1242 len. 27]: In any case , your continuance in the service must depend on your knowledge of the lord of it , and his will concerning you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1243 len. 16]: `` May not a prejudice in favour of my profession blind and deceive me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1244 len. 16]: `` I think it will rather make YOU doubtful of conclusions that support it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1245 len. 31]: `` I will go and try , '' said Wingfold , rising ; `` but I fear I am not the man to make discoveries in such high regions . ''
Parsing [sent. 1246 len. 22]: `` You are the man to find what fits your own need if the thing be there , '' said Polwarth .
Parsing [sent. 1247 len. 95]: `` But to ease your mind for the task : I know pretty well some of our best English writers of the more practical and poetic sort in theology -- the two qualities go together -- and if you will do me the favour to come again to-morrow , I shall be able , I trust , to provide you wherewithal to feed your flock , free of that duplicity which , be it as common as the surplice , and as fully connived as laughed at by that flock , is yet duplicity .
Parsing [sent. 1248 len. 25]: There is no law that sermons shall be the preacher 's own , but there is an eternal law against all manner of humbug .
Parsing [sent. 1249 len. 5]: Pardon the word . ''
Parsing [sent. 1250 len. 23]: `` I will not attempt to thank you , '' said Wingfold , `` but I will do as you tell me .
Parsing [sent. 1251 len. 20]: You are the first real friend I have ever had -- except my brother , who is dead . ''
Parsing [sent. 1252 len. 13]: `` Perhaps you have had more friends than you are aware of .
Parsing [sent. 1253 len. 31]: You owe something to the man , for instance , who , with his outspoken antagonism , roused you first to a sense of what was lacking to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1254 len. 18]: `` I hope I shall be grateful to God for it some day , '' returned Wingfold .
Parsing [sent. 1255 len. 14]: `` I can not say that I feel much obligation to Mr. Bascombe .
Parsing [sent. 1256 len. 29]: And yet when I think of it , -- perhaps -- I do n't know -- what ought a man to be more grateful for than honesty ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1257 len. 32]: After a word of arrangement for next day the curate took his leave , assuredly with a stronger feeling of simple genuine respect than he had ever yet felt for man .
Parsing [sent. 1258 len. 32]: Rachel bade him good night with her fine eyes filled with tears , which suited their expression , for they always seemed to be looking through sorrow to something beyond it .
Parsing [sent. 1259 len. 43]: `` If this be a type of the way the sins of the fathers are visited upon the children , '' said the curate to himself , `` there must be more in the progression of history than political economy can explain .
Parsing [sent. 1260 len. 40]: It would drive us to believe in an economy wherein rather the well-being of the whole was the result of individual treatment , and not the well-being of the individual the result of the management of the whole ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1261 len. 17]: I will not count the milestones along the road on which Wingfold now began to journey .
Parsing [sent. 1262 len. 16]: Some of the stages , however , will appear in the course of my story .
Parsing [sent. 1263 len. 20]: When he came to any stiff bit of collar-work , the little man generally appeared with an extra horse .
Parsing [sent. 1264 len. 14]: Every day during the rest of that week he saw his new friends .
Parsing [sent. 1265 len. 3]: CHAPTER XX .
Parsing [sent. 1266 len. 4]: A STRANGE SERMON .
Parsing [sent. 1267 len. 35]: On the Sunday the curate walked across the churchyard to the morning prayer very much as if the bells , instead of ringing the people to church , had been tolling for his execution .
Parsing [sent. 1268 len. 22]: But if he was going to be hanged , he would at least die like a gentleman , confessing his sin .
Parsing [sent. 1269 len. 11]: Only he would it were bed-time , and all well .
Parsing [sent. 1270 len. 28]: He trembled so when he stood up to read that he could not tell whether or not he was speaking in a voice audible to the congregation .
Parsing [sent. 1271 len. 50]: But as his hour drew near , the courage to meet it drew near also , and when at length he ascended the pulpit stairs , he was able to cast a glance across the sea of heads to learn whether the little man was in the poor seats .
Parsing [sent. 1272 len. 10]: But he looked for the big head in vain .
Parsing [sent. 1273 len. 22]: When he read his text , it was to a congregation as listless and indifferent as it was wont to be .
Parsing [sent. 1274 len. 39]: He had not gone far , however , before that change of mental condition was visible in the faces before him , which a troop of horses would have shown by a general forward swivelling of the ears .
Parsing [sent. 1275 len. 9]: Wonderful to tell , they were actually listening .
Parsing [sent. 1276 len. 31]: But in truth it was no wonder , for seldom in any , and assuredly never in that church , had there been heard such an exordium to a sermon .
Parsing [sent. 1277 len. 13]: His text was -- `` Confessing your faults one to another . ''
Parsing [sent. 1278 len. 59]: Having read it with a return of the former trembling , and paused , his brain suddenly seemed for a moment to reel under a wave of extinction that struck it , then to float away upon it , and then to dissolve in it , as it interpenetrated its whole mass , annihilating thought and utterance together .
Parsing [sent. 1279 len. 36]: But with a mighty effort of the will , in which he seemed to come as near as man could come to the willing of his own existence , he recovered himself and went on .
Parsing [sent. 1280 len. 45]: To do justice to this effort , my reader must remember that he was a shy man , and that he knew his congregation but too well for an unsympathetic one -- whether from their fault or his own mattered little for the nonce .
Parsing [sent. 1281 len. 61]: It had been hard enough to make up his mind to the attempt when alone in his study , or rather , to tell the truth , in his chamber , but to carry out his resolve in the face of so many faces , and in spite of a cowardly brain , was an effort and a victory indeed .
Parsing [sent. 1282 len. 29]: Yet after all , upon second thoughts , I see that the true resolve was the victory , sweeping shyness and every other opposing weakness along with it .
Parsing [sent. 1283 len. 39]: But it wanted courage of yet another sort to make of his resolve a fact , and his courage , in that kind as well , had never yet been put to the test or trained by trial .
Parsing [sent. 1284 len. 81]: He had not been a fighting boy at school ; he had never had the chance of riding to hounds ; he had never been in a shipwreck , or a house on fire ; had never been waked from a sound sleep with a demand for his watch and money ; yet one who had passed creditably through all these trials , might still have carried a doubting conscience to his grave rather than face what Wingfold now confronted .
Parsing [sent. 1285 len. 19]: From the manuscript before him he read thus : '' ` Confess your faults one to another . '
Parsing [sent. 1286 len. 38]: -- This command of the apostle , my hearers , ought to justify me in doing what I fear some of you may consider almost as a breach of morals -- talking of myself in the pulpit .
Parsing [sent. 1287 len. 19]: But in the pulpit has a wrong been done , and in the pulpit shall it be confessed .
Parsing [sent. 1288 len. 42]: From Sunday to Sunday , standing on this spot , I have read to you , without word of explanation , as if they formed the message I had sought and found for you , the thoughts and words of another .
Parsing [sent. 1289 len. 36]: Doubtless they were better than any I could have given you from my own mind or experience , and the act had been a righteous one , had I told you the truth concerning them .
Parsing [sent. 1290 len. 9]: But that truth I did not tell you .
Parsing [sent. 1291 len. 35]: -- At last , through words of honest expostulation , the voice of a friend whose wounds are faithful , I have been aroused to a knowledge of the wrong I have been doing .
Parsing [sent. 1292 len. 6]: Therefore I now confess it .
Parsing [sent. 1293 len. 4]: I am sorry .
Parsing [sent. 1294 len. 7]: I will do so no more .
Parsing [sent. 1295 len. 48]: `` But , brethren , I have only a little garden on a bare hill-side , and it hath never yet borne me any fruit fit to offer for your acceptance ; also , my heart is troubled about many things , and God hath humbled me .
Parsing [sent. 1296 len. 45]: I beg of you , therefore , to bear with me for a little while , if , doing what is but lawful and expedient both , I break through the bonds of custom in order to provide you with food convenient for you .
Parsing [sent. 1297 len. 15]: Should I fail in this , I shall make room for a better man .
Parsing [sent. 1298 len. 78]: But for your bread of this day , I go gleaning openly in other men 's fields -- fields into which I could not have found my way , in time at least for your necessities , and where I could not have gathered such full ears of wheat , barley , and oats but for the more than assistance of the same friend who warned me of the wrong I was doing both you and myself .
Parsing [sent. 1299 len. 18]: Right ancient fields are some of them , where yet the ears lie thick for the gleaner .
Parsing [sent. 1300 len. 53]: To continue my metaphor : I will lay each handful before you with the name of the field where I gathered it ; and together they will serve to show what some of the wisest and best shepherds of the English flock have believed concerning the duty of confessing our faults . ''
Parsing [sent. 1301 len. 29]: He then proceeded to read the extracts which Mr. Polwarth had helped him to find -- and arrange , not chronologically , but after an idea of growth .
Parsing [sent. 1302 len. 25]: Each handful , as he called it , he prefaced with one or two words concerning him in whose field he had gleaned it .
Parsing [sent. 1303 len. 9]: His voice steadied and strengthened as he read .
Parsing [sent. 1304 len. 61]: Renewed contact with the minds of those vanished teachers gave him a delight which infused itself into the uttered words , and made them also joyful ; and if the curate preached to no one else in the congregation , certainly he preached to himself , and before it was done had entered into a thorough enjoyment of the sermon .
Parsing [sent. 1305 len. 45]: A few in the congregation were disappointed because they had looked for a justification and enforcement of the confessional , thinking the change in the curate could only have come from that portion of the ecclesiastical heavens towards which they themselves turned their faces .
Parsing [sent. 1306 len. 22]: A few others were scandalized at such an innovation on the part of a young man who was only a curate .
Parsing [sent. 1307 len. 25]: Many however declared that it was the most interesting sermon they had ever heard in their lives -- which perhaps was not saying much .
Parsing [sent. 1308 len. 8]: Mrs. Ramshorn made a class by herself .
Parsing [sent. 1309 len. 40]: Not having yet learned to like Wingfold , and being herself one of the craft , with a knowledge of not a few of the secrets of the clerical -- prison-house , shall I call it , or green-room ?
Parsing [sent. 1310 len. 20]: -- she was indignant with the presumptuous young man who degraded the pulpit to a level with the dock .
Parsing [sent. 1311 len. 5]: Who cared for him ?
Parsing [sent. 1312 len. 38]: What was it to a congregation of respectable people , many of them belonging to the first county families , that he , a mere curate , should have committed what he fancied a crime against them !
Parsing [sent. 1313 len. 13]: He should have waited until it had been laid to his charge .
Parsing [sent. 1314 len. 33]: Could n't he repent of his sins , whatever they were , without making a boast of them in the pulpit , and exposing them to the eyes of a whole congregation ?
Parsing [sent. 1315 len. 11]: She had known people make a stock-in-trade of their sins !
Parsing [sent. 1316 len. 26]: What was it to them whether the washy stuff he gave them by way of sermons was his own foolishness or some other noodle 's !
Parsing [sent. 1317 len. 20]: Nobody would have troubled himself to inquire into his honesty , if he had but held his foolish tongue .
Parsing [sent. 1318 len. 17]: Better men than he had preached other people 's sermons and never thought it worth mentioning .
Parsing [sent. 1319 len. 7]: And what worse were the people ?
Parsing [sent. 1320 len. 41]: The only harm lay in letting them know it ; that brought the profession into disgrace , and prevented the good the sermon would otherwise have done , besides giving the enemies of the truth a handle against the church .
Parsing [sent. 1321 len. 10]: And then such a thing to call a sermon !
Parsing [sent. 1322 len. 11]: As well take a string of blown eggs to market !
Parsing [sent. 1323 len. 22]: Thus she expatiated , half the way home , before either of her companions found an opportunity of saying a word .
Parsing [sent. 1324 len. 15]: `` I am sorry to differ from you , aunt , '' said Helen .
Parsing [sent. 1325 len. 10]: `` I thought the sermon a very interesting one .
Parsing [sent. 1326 len. 5]: He read beautifully . ''
Parsing [sent. 1327 len. 35]: `` For my part , '' said Bascombe , who was now a regular visitor from Saturdays to Mondays , `` I used to think the fellow a muff , but , by Jove !
Parsing [sent. 1328 len. 6]: I 've changed my mind .
Parsing [sent. 1329 len. 36]: If ever there was a plucky thing to do , that was one , and there ai n't many men , let me tell you , aunt , who would have the pluck for it .
Parsing [sent. 1330 len. 36]: -- It 's my belief , Helen , '' he went on , turning to her and speaking in a lower tone , `` I 've had the honour of doing that fellow some good .
Parsing [sent. 1331 len. 16]: I gave him my mind about honesty pretty plainly the first time I saw him .
Parsing [sent. 1332 len. 18]: And who can tell what may come next when a fellow once starts in the right way !
Parsing [sent. 1333 len. 9]: We shall have him with us before long .
Parsing [sent. 1334 len. 26]: I must look out for something for him , for of course he 'll be in a devil of a fix without his profession . ''
Parsing [sent. 1335 len. 13]: `` I am so glad you think with me , George ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1336 len. 3]: said Helen .
Parsing [sent. 1337 len. 14]: `` There was always something I was inclined to like about Mr. Wingfold .
Parsing [sent. 1338 len. 17]: Indeed I should have liked him quite if he had not been so painfully modest . ''
Parsing [sent. 1339 len. 33]: `` Notwithstanding his sheepishness , though , '' returned Bascombe , `` there was a sort of quiet self-satisfaction about him , and the way he always said Do n't you think ?
Parsing [sent. 1340 len. 42]: as if he were Socrates taking advantage of Mr. Green and softly guiding him into a trap , which I confess made me set him down as conceited ; but , as I say , I begin to change my mind .
Parsing [sent. 1341 len. 3]: By Jove !
Parsing [sent. 1342 len. 24]: he must have worked pretty hard too in the dust-bins to get together all those bits of gay rag and resplendent crockery ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1343 len. 13]: `` You heard him say he had help , '' said Helen .
Parsing [sent. 1344 len. 10]: `` No , I do n't remember that . ''
Parsing [sent. 1345 len. 15]: `` It came just after that pretty simile about gleaning in old fields . ''
Parsing [sent. 1346 len. 25]: `` I remember the simile , for I thought it a very absurd one -- as if fields would lie gleanable for generations ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1347 len. 12]: `` To be sure -- now you point it out ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1348 len. 3]: acquiesced Helen .
Parsing [sent. 1349 len. 12]: `` The grain would have sprouted and borne harvests a hundred .
Parsing [sent. 1350 len. 16]: If a man will use figures , he should be careful to give them legs .
Parsing [sent. 1351 len. 17]: I wonder whom he got to help him -- not the rector , I suppose ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1352 len. 5]: `` The rector ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1353 len. 64]: echoed Mrs. Ramshorn , who had been listening to the young people 's remarks with a smile of quiet scorn on her lip , thinking what an advantage was experience , even if it could not make up for the loss of youth and beauty -- `` The last man in the world to lend himself to such a miserable makeshift and pretence !
Parsing [sent. 1354 len. 57]: Without brains enough even to fancy himself able to write a sermon of his own , he flies to the dead , -- to their very coffins as it were -- and I will not say STEALS from them , for he does it openly , not having even shame enough to conceal his shame ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1355 len. 22]: `` I like a man to hold his face to what he does , or thinks either , '' said Bascombe .
Parsing [sent. 1356 len. 6]: `` Ah , George ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1357 len. 28]: returned his aunt , in tones of wisdom , `` by the time you have had my experience , you will have learned a little prudence . ''
Parsing [sent. 1358 len. 30]: Meantime , so far as his aunt was concerned , George did use prudence , for in her presence he did not hold his face to what he thought .
Parsing [sent. 1359 len. 11]: He said to himself it would do her no good .
Parsing [sent. 1360 len. 5]: She was so prejudiced !
Parsing [sent. 1361 len. 8]: and it might interfere with his visits .
Parsing [sent. 1362 len. 27]: -- She , for her part , never had the slightest doubt of his orthodoxy : was he not the son of a clergyman and canon ?
Parsing [sent. 1363 len. 8]: -- a grandson of the church herself ?
Parsing [sent. 1364 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXI .
Parsing [sent. 1365 len. 3]: A THUNDERBOLT .
Parsing [sent. 1366 len. 60]: Sometimes a thunderbolt , as men call it , will shoot from a clear sky ; and sometimes into the midst of a peaceful family , or a yet quieter individuality , without warning of gathered storm above , or lightest tremble of earthquake beneath , will fall a terrible fact , and from the moment everything is changed .
Parsing [sent. 1367 len. 21]: That family or that life is no more what it was -- probably never more can be what it was .
Parsing [sent. 1368 len. 17]: Better it ought to be , worse it may be -- which , depends upon itself .
Parsing [sent. 1369 len. 7]: But its spiritual weather is altered .
Parsing [sent. 1370 len. 14]: The air is thick with cloud , and can not weep itself clear .
Parsing [sent. 1371 len. 8]: There may come a gorgeous sunset though .
Parsing [sent. 1372 len. 30]: It were a truism for one who believes in God to say that such catastrophes , so rending , so frightful , never come but where they are needed .
Parsing [sent. 1373 len. 21]: The Power of Life is not content that they who live in and by him should live poorly and contemptibly .
Parsing [sent. 1374 len. 48]: If the presence of low thoughts which he repudiates , yet makes a man miserable , how must it be with him if they who live and move and have their being in him are mean and repulsive , or alienated through self-sufficiency and slowness of heart ?
Parsing [sent. 1375 len. 16]: I can not report much progress in Helen during the months of winter and spring .
Parsing [sent. 1376 len. 28]: But if one wakes at last , wakes at all , who shall dare cast the stone at him -- that he ought to have awaked sooner ?
Parsing [sent. 1377 len. 22]: What man who is awake will dare to say that he roused himself the first moment it became possible to him ?
Parsing [sent. 1378 len. 23]: The main and plain and worst , perhaps only condemnation is -- that when people do wake they do not get up .
Parsing [sent. 1379 len. 28]: At the same time , however , I can hardly doubt that Helen was keeping the law of a progress slow as the growth of an iron-tree .
Parsing [sent. 1380 len. 7]: Nothing had ever yet troubled her .
Parsing [sent. 1381 len. 17]: She had never been in love , could hardly be said to be in love now .
Parsing [sent. 1382 len. 30]: She went regularly to church , and I believe said her prayers night and morning -- yet felt no indignation at the doctrines and theories propounded by George Bascombe .
Parsing [sent. 1383 len. 43]: She regarded them as `` George 's ideas , '' and never cared to ask whether they were true or not , at the same time that they were becoming to her by degrees as like truth as falsehood can ever be .
Parsing [sent. 1384 len. 12]: For to the untruthful mind the false CAN seem the true .
Parsing [sent. 1385 len. 69]: Meantime she was not even capable of giving him the credit he deserved , in that , holding the opinions he held , he yet advocated a life spent for the community -- without , as I presume , deriving much inspiration thereto from what he himself would represent as the ground of all conscientious action , the consideration , namely , of its reaction upon its originator .
Parsing [sent. 1386 len. 63]: Still farther was it from entering the field of her vision that possibly some of the good which distinguished George 's unbelief from that of his brother ephemera of the last century , was owing to the deeper working of that leaven which he denounced as the poisonous root whence sprung all the evil diseases that gnawed at the heart of society .
Parsing [sent. 1387 len. 12]: One night she sat late , making her aunt a cap .
Parsing [sent. 1388 len. 45]: The one sign of originality in her was the character of her millinery , of which kind of creation she was fond , displaying therein both invention as to form , and perception as to effect , combined with lightness and deftness of execution .
Parsing [sent. 1389 len. 20]: She was desirous of completing it before the next morning , which was that of her aunt 's birthday .
Parsing [sent. 1390 len. 23]: They had had friends to dine with them who had stayed rather late , and it was now getting towards one o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 1391 len. 47]: But Helen was not easily tired , and was not given to abandoning what she had undertaken ; so she sat working away , and thinking , not of George Bascombe , but of one whom she loved better -- far better -- her brother Leopold .
Parsing [sent. 1392 len. 13]: But she was thinking of him not quite so comfortably as usual .
Parsing [sent. 1393 len. 25]: Certain anxieties she had ground for concerning him had grown stronger , for the time since she heard from him had grown very long .
Parsing [sent. 1394 len. 21]: All at once her work ceased , her hands were arrested , her posture grew rigid : she was listening .
Parsing [sent. 1395 len. 9]: HAD she heard a noise outside her window ?
Parsing [sent. 1396 len. 42]: My reader may remember that it opened on a balcony , which was at the same time the roof of a veranda that went along the back of the house , and had a stair at one end to the garden .
Parsing [sent. 1397 len. 19]: Helen was not easily frightened , and had stopped her needle only that she might listen the better .
Parsing [sent. 1398 len. 4]: She heard nothing .
Parsing [sent. 1399 len. 8]: Of course it was but a fancy !
Parsing [sent. 1400 len. 9]: Her hands went on again with their work .
Parsing [sent. 1401 len. 13]: -- But that was really very like a tap at the window !
Parsing [sent. 1402 len. 30]: And now her heart did beat a little faster , if not with fear , then with something very like it , in which perhaps some foreboding was mingled .
Parsing [sent. 1403 len. 19]: But she was not a woman to lay down her arms upon the inroad of a vague terror .
Parsing [sent. 1404 len. 34]: She quietly rose , and , saying to herself it must be one of the pigeons that haunted the balcony , laid her work on the table , and went to the window .
Parsing [sent. 1405 len. 31]: As she drew one of the curtains a little aside to peep , the tap was plainly and hurriedly though softly repeated , and at once she swept it back .
Parsing [sent. 1406 len. 26]: There was the dim shadow of a man 's head upon the blind , cast there by an old withered moon low in the west !
Parsing [sent. 1407 len. 39]: Perhaps it was something in the shape of the shadow that made her pull up the blind so hurriedly , and yet with something of the awe with which we take `` the face-cloth from the face . ''
Parsing [sent. 1408 len. 7]: Yes , there was a face !
Parsing [sent. 1409 len. 30]: -- frightful , not as that of a corpse , but as that of a spectre from whose soul the scars of his mortal end have never passed away .
Parsing [sent. 1410 len. 16]: Helen did not scream -- her throat seemed to close and her heart to cease .
Parsing [sent. 1411 len. 67]: But her eyes continued movelessly fixed on the face even after she knew it was the face of her brother , and the eyes of the face kept staring back into hers through the glass with such a look of concentrated eagerness that they seemed no more organs of vision , but caves of hunger , nor was there a movement of the lips towards speech .
Parsing [sent. 1412 len. 13]: The two gazed at each other for a moment of rigid silence .
Parsing [sent. 1413 len. 26]: The glass that separated them might have been the veil that divides those who call themselves the living from those whom they call the dead .
Parsing [sent. 1414 len. 18]: It was but a moment by the clock , though to the after-consciousness it seemed space immeasurable .
Parsing [sent. 1415 len. 24]: She came to herself , and slowly , noiselessly , though with tremulous hand , undid the sash , and opened the window .
Parsing [sent. 1416 len. 16]: Nothing divided them now , yet he stood as before , staring into her face .
Parsing [sent. 1417 len. 14]: Presently his lips began to move , but no words came from them .
Parsing [sent. 1418 len. 12]: In Helen , horror had already roused the instinct of secrecy .
Parsing [sent. 1419 len. 48]: She put out her two hands , took his face between them , and said in a hurried whisper , calling him by the pet name she had given him when a child , `` Come in , Poldie , and tell me all about it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1420 len. 7]: Her voice seemed to wake him .
Parsing [sent. 1421 len. 51]: Slowly , with the movements of one half paralyzed , he shoved and dragged himself over the windowsill , dropped himself on the floor inside , and lay there , looking up in her face like a hunted animal , that hoped he had found a refuge , but doubted .
Parsing [sent. 1422 len. 26]: Seeing him so exhausted , she turned from him to go and get some brandy , but a low cry of agony drew her back .
Parsing [sent. 1423 len. 33]: His head was raised from the floor and his hands were stretched out , while his face entreated her , as plainly as if he had spoken , not to leave him .
Parsing [sent. 1424 len. 23]: She knelt and would have kissed him , but he turned his face from her with an expression which seemed of disgust .
Parsing [sent. 1425 len. 16]: `` Poldie , '' she said , `` I MUST go and get you something .
Parsing [sent. 1426 len. 5]: Do n't be afraid .
Parsing [sent. 1427 len. 7]: They are all sound asleep . ''
Parsing [sent. 1428 len. 19]: The grasp with which he had clutched her dress relaxed , and his hand fell by his side .
Parsing [sent. 1429 len. 35]: She rose at once and went , creeping through the slumberous house , light and noiseless as a shadow , but with a heart that seemed not her own lying hard in her bosom .
Parsing [sent. 1430 len. 21]: As she went she had to struggle both to rouse and to compose herself , for she could not think .
Parsing [sent. 1431 len. 14]: An age seemed to have passed since she heard the clock strike twelve .
Parsing [sent. 1432 len. 22]: One thing was clear -- her brother had been doing something wrong , and dreading discovery , had fled to her .
Parsing [sent. 1433 len. 43]: The moment this conviction made itself plain to her , she drew herself up with the great deep breath of a vow , as strong as it was silent and undefined , that he should not have come to her in vain .
Parsing [sent. 1434 len. 56]: Silent-footed as a beast of prey , silent-handed as a thief , lithe in her movements , her eye flashing with the new-kindled instinct of motherhood to the orphan of her father , it was as if her soul had been suddenly raised to a white heat , which rendered her body elastic and responsive .
Parsing [sent. 1435 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXII .
Parsing [sent. 1436 len. 2]: LEOPOLD .
Parsing [sent. 1437 len. 15]: She re-entered her room with the gait of a new-born goddess treading the air .
Parsing [sent. 1438 len. 11]: Her brother was yet prostrate where she had left him .
Parsing [sent. 1439 len. 31]: He raised himself on his elbow , seized with trembling hand the glass she offered him , swallowed the brandy at a gulp , and sank again on the floor .
Parsing [sent. 1440 len. 46]: The next instant he sprang to his feet , cast a terrified look at the window , bounded to the door and locked it , then ran to his sister , threw his arms about her , and clung to her like a trembling child .
Parsing [sent. 1441 len. 10]: But ever his eyes kept turning to the window .
Parsing [sent. 1442 len. 21]: Though now twenty years of age , and at his full height , he was hardly so tall as Helen .
Parsing [sent. 1443 len. 44]: Swarthy of complexion , his hair dark as the night , his eyes large and lustrous , with what Milton calls `` quel sereno fulgor d' amabil nero , '' his frame nervous and slender , he looked compact and small beside her .
Parsing [sent. 1444 len. 28]: She did her utmost to quiet him , unconsciously using the same words and tones with which she had soothed his passions when he was a child .
Parsing [sent. 1445 len. 44]: All at once he raised his head and drew himself back from her arms with a look of horror , then put his hand over his eyes , as if her face had been a mirror and he had seen himself in it .
Parsing [sent. 1446 len. 11]: `` What is that on your wristband , Leopold ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1447 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 1448 len. 7]: `` Have you hurt yourself ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1449 len. 54]: The youth cast an indescribable look on his hand , but it was not that which turned Helen so deadly sick : with her question had come to her the ghastly suspicion that the blood she saw was not his , and she felt guilty of an unpardonable , wicked wrong against him .
Parsing [sent. 1450 len. 9]: But she would never , never believe it !
Parsing [sent. 1451 len. 11]: A sister suspect her only brother of such a crime !
Parsing [sent. 1452 len. 9]: Yet her arms dropped and let him go .
Parsing [sent. 1453 len. 42]: She stepped back a pace , and of themselves , as it were , her eyes went wandering and questioning all over him , and saw that his clothes were torn and soiled -- stained -- who could tell with what ?
Parsing [sent. 1454 len. 16]: He stood for a moment still and submissive to their search , with face downcast .
Parsing [sent. 1455 len. 42]: Then , suddenly flashing his eyes on her , he said , in a voice that seemed to force its way through earth that choked it back , `` Helen , I am a murderer , and they are after me .
Parsing [sent. 1456 len. 8]: They will be here before daylight . ''
Parsing [sent. 1457 len. 10]: He dropped on his knees , and clasped hers .
Parsing [sent. 1458 len. 4]: `` O sister !
Parsing [sent. 1459 len. 2]: sister !
Parsing [sent. 1460 len. 7]: save me , save me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1461 len. 8]: he cried in a voice of agony .
Parsing [sent. 1462 len. 13]: Helen stood without response , for to stand took all her strength .
Parsing [sent. 1463 len. 56]: How long she fought that horrible sickness , knowing that , if she moved an inch , turned from it a moment , yielded a hair 's - breadth , it would throw her senseless on the floor , and the noise of her fall would rouse the house , she never could even conjecture .
Parsing [sent. 1464 len. 41]: All was dark before her , as if her gaze had been on the underside of her coffin-lid , and her brain sank and swayed and swung in the coils of the white snake that was sucking at her heart .
Parsing [sent. 1465 len. 42]: At length the darkness thinned ; it grew a gray mist ; the face of her boy-brother glimmered up through it , like that of Dives in hell-fire to his guardian-angel as he hung lax-winged and faint in the ascending smoke .
Parsing [sent. 1466 len. 83]: The mist thinned , and at length she caught a glimmer of his pleading , despairing , self-horrified eyes : all the mother in her nature rushed to the aid of her struggling will ; her heart gave a great heave ; the blood ascended to her white brain , and flushed it with rosy life ; her body was once more reconciled and obedient ; her hand went forth , took his head between them , and pressed it against her .
Parsing [sent. 1467 len. 25]: `` Poldie , dear , '' she said , `` be calm and reasonable , and I will do all I can for you .
Parsing [sent. 1468 len. 5]: Here , take this .
Parsing [sent. 1469 len. 20]: -- And now , answer me one question '' `` You wo n't give me up , Helen ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1470 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 1471 len. 5]: I will not . ''
Parsing [sent. 1472 len. 7]: `` Swear it , Helen . ''
Parsing [sent. 1473 len. 7]: `` Ah , my poor Poldie !
Parsing [sent. 1474 len. 11]: is it come to this between you and me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1475 len. 7]: `` Swear it , Helen . ''
Parsing [sent. 1476 len. 11]: `` So help me God , I will not ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1477 len. 6]: returned Helen , looking up .
Parsing [sent. 1478 len. 24]: Leopold rose , and again stood quietly before her , but again with downbent head , like a prisoner about to receive sentence .
Parsing [sent. 1479 len. 21]: `` Do you mean what you said a moment since -- that the police are in search of you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1480 len. 7]: asked Helen , with forced calmness .
Parsing [sent. 1481 len. 5]: `` They must be .
Parsing [sent. 1482 len. 16]: They must have been after me for days -- I do n't know how many .
Parsing [sent. 1483 len. 6]: They will be here soon .
Parsing [sent. 1484 len. 12]: I ca n't think how I have escaped them so long .
Parsing [sent. 1485 len. 2]: Hark !
Parsing [sent. 1486 len. 9]: Is n't that a noise at the street-door ?
Parsing [sent. 1487 len. 5]: -- No , no .
Parsing [sent. 1488 len. 9]: -- There 's a shadow on the curtains !
Parsing [sent. 1489 len. 3]: -- No !
Parsing [sent. 1490 len. 13]: it 's my eyes ; they 've cheated me a thousand times .
Parsing [sent. 1491 len. 2]: Helen !
Parsing [sent. 1492 len. 17]: I did not try to hide her ; they must have found her long ago . ''
Parsing [sent. 1493 len. 5]: `` My God ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1494 len. 14]: cried Helen ; but checked the scream that sought to follow the cry .
Parsing [sent. 1495 len. 15]: `` There was an old shaft near , '' he went on , hurriedly .
Parsing [sent. 1496 len. 34]: `` If I had thrown her down that , they would never have found her , for there must be choke-damp at the bottom of it enough to kill a thousand of them .
Parsing [sent. 1497 len. 22]: But I could not bear the thought of sending the lovely thing down there -- even to save my life . ''
Parsing [sent. 1498 len. 25]: He was growing wild again ; but the horror had again laid hold upon Helen , and she stood speechless , staring at him .
Parsing [sent. 1499 len. 10]: `` Hide me -- hide me , Helen ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1500 len. 3]: he pleaded .
Parsing [sent. 1501 len. 8]: `` Perhaps you think I am mad .
Parsing [sent. 1502 len. 6]: Would to God I were !
Parsing [sent. 1503 len. 7]: Sometimes I think I must be .
Parsing [sent. 1504 len. 11]: But this I tell you is no madman 's fancy .
Parsing [sent. 1505 len. 15]: If you take it for that , you will bring me to the gallows .
Parsing [sent. 1506 len. 19]: So , if you will see me hanged , -- '' He sat down and folded his arms .
Parsing [sent. 1507 len. 3]: `` Hush !
Parsing [sent. 1508 len. 5]: Poldie , hush ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1509 len. 8]: cried Helen , in an agonized whisper .
Parsing [sent. 1510 len. 11]: `` I am only thinking what I can best do .
Parsing [sent. 1511 len. 45]: I can not hide you here , for if my aunt knew , she would betray you by her terrors ; and if she did not know , and those men came , she would help them to search every corner of the house .
Parsing [sent. 1512 len. 8]: Otherwise there might be a chance . ''
Parsing [sent. 1513 len. 26]: Again she was silent for a few moments ; then , seeming suddenly to have made up her mind , went softly to the door .
Parsing [sent. 1514 len. 7]: `` Do n't leave me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1515 len. 3]: cried Leopold .
Parsing [sent. 1516 len. 3]: `` Hush !
Parsing [sent. 1517 len. 3]: I must .
Parsing [sent. 1518 len. 7]: I know now what to do .
Parsing [sent. 1519 len. 9]: Be quiet here until I come back . ''
Parsing [sent. 1520 len. 13]: Slowly , cautiously , she unlocked it , and left the room .
Parsing [sent. 1521 len. 19]: In three or four minutes she returned , carrying a loaf of bread and a bottle of wine .
Parsing [sent. 1522 len. 7]: To her dismay Leopold had vanished .
Parsing [sent. 1523 len. 23]: Presently he came creeping out from under the bed , looking so abject that Helen could not help a pang of shame .
Parsing [sent. 1524 len. 29]: But the next moment the love of the sister , the tender compassion of the woman , returned in full tide , and swallowed up the unsightly thing .
Parsing [sent. 1525 len. 17]: The more abject he was , the more was he to be pitied and ministered to .
Parsing [sent. 1526 len. 22]: `` Here , Poldie , '' she said , `` you carry the bread , and I will take the wine .
Parsing [sent. 1527 len. 12]: You must eat something , or you will be ill . ''
Parsing [sent. 1528 len. 9]: As she spoke she locked the door again .
Parsing [sent. 1529 len. 17]: Then she put a dark shawl over her head , and fastened it under her chin .
Parsing [sent. 1530 len. 15]: Her white face shone out from it like the moon from a dark cloud .
Parsing [sent. 1531 len. 21]: `` Follow me , Poldie , '' she said , and putting out the candles , went to the window .
Parsing [sent. 1532 len. 15]: He obeyed without question , carrying the loaf she had put into his hands .
Parsing [sent. 1533 len. 18]: The window-sash rested on a little door ; she opened it , and stepped on the balcony .
Parsing [sent. 1534 len. 43]: As soon as her brother had followed her , she closed it again , drew down the sash , and led the way to the garden , and so , by the door in the sunk fence , out upon the meadows .
Parsing [sent. 1535 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXIII .
Parsing [sent. 1536 len. 3]: THE REFUGE .
Parsing [sent. 1537 len. 16]: The night was very dusky , but Helen knew perfectly the way she was going .
Parsing [sent. 1538 len. 14]: A strange excitement possessed her , and lifted her above all personal fear .
Parsing [sent. 1539 len. 26]: The instant she found herself in the open air , her faculties seemed to come preternaturally awake , and her judgment to grow quite cool .
Parsing [sent. 1540 len. 19]: She congratulated herself that there had been no rain , and the ground would not betray their steps .
Parsing [sent. 1541 len. 43]: There was enough of light in the sky to see the trees against it , and partly by their outlines she guided herself to the door in the park-paling , whence she went as straight as she could for the deserted house .
Parsing [sent. 1542 len. 34]: Remembering well her brother 's old dislike to the place , she said nothing of their destination ; but , when he suddenly stopped , she knew that it had dawned upon him .
Parsing [sent. 1543 len. 22]: For one moment he hung back , but a stronger and more definite fear lay behind , and he went on .
Parsing [sent. 1544 len. 39]: Emerging from the trees on the edge of the hollow , they looked down , but it was too dark to see the mass of the house , or the slightest gleam from the surface of the lake .
Parsing [sent. 1545 len. 24]: All was silent as a deserted churchyard , and they went down the slope as if it had been the descent to Hades .
Parsing [sent. 1546 len. 35]: Arrived at the wall of the garden , they followed its buttressed length until they came to a tall narrow gate of wrought iron , almost consumed with rust , and standing half open .
Parsing [sent. 1547 len. 32]: By this they passed into the desolate garden , whose misery in the daytime was like that of a ruined soul , but now hidden in the night 's black mantle .
Parsing [sent. 1548 len. 47]: Through the straggling bushes with their arms they forced and with their feet they felt their way to the front door of the house , the steps to which , from the effects of various floods , were all out of the level in different directions .
Parsing [sent. 1549 len. 20]: The door was unlocked as usual , needing only a strong push to open it , and they entered .
Parsing [sent. 1550 len. 6]: How awfully still it seemed !
Parsing [sent. 1551 len. 14]: -- much stiller than the open air , though that had seemed noiseless .
Parsing [sent. 1552 len. 13]: There was not a rat or a black beetle in the place .
Parsing [sent. 1553 len. 37]: They groped their way through the hall , and up the wide staircase , which gave not one crack in answer to their needlessly careful footsteps : not a soul was within a mile of them .
Parsing [sent. 1554 len. 23]: Helen had taken Leopold by the hand , and she now led him straight to the closet whence the hidden room opened .
Parsing [sent. 1555 len. 17]: He made no resistance , for the covering wings of the darkness had protection in them .
Parsing [sent. 1556 len. 11]: How desolate must the soul be that welcomes such protection !
Parsing [sent. 1557 len. 46]: But when , knowing that thence no ray could reach the outside , she struck a light , and the spot where he had so often shuddered was laid bare to his soul , he gave a cry and turned and would have rushed away .
Parsing [sent. 1558 len. 17]: Helen caught him , he yielded , and allowed her to lead him into the room .
Parsing [sent. 1559 len. 41]: There she lighted a candle , and as it came gradually alive , it shed a pale yellow light around , and revealed a bare chamber , with a bedstead and the remains of a moth-eaten mattress in a corner .
Parsing [sent. 1560 len. 19]: Leopold threw himself upon it , uttering a sound that more resembled a choked scream than a groan .
Parsing [sent. 1561 len. 40]: Helen sat down beside him , took his head on her lap , and sought to soothe him with such tender loving words as had never before found birth in her heart , not to say crossed her lips .
Parsing [sent. 1562 len. 20]: She took from her pocket a dainty morsel , and tried to make him eat , but in vain .
Parsing [sent. 1563 len. 10]: Then she poured him out a cupful of wine .
Parsing [sent. 1564 len. 17]: He drank it eagerly , and asked for more , which she would not give him .
Parsing [sent. 1565 len. 16]: But instead of comforting him , it seemed only to rouse him to fresh horror .
Parsing [sent. 1566 len. 41]: He clung to his sister as a child clings to the nurse who has just been telling him an evil tale , and ever his face would keep turning from her to the door with a look of frightful anticipation .
Parsing [sent. 1567 len. 47]: She consoled him with all her ingenuity , assured him that for the present he was perfectly safe , and , thinking it would encourage a sense of concealment , reminded him of the trap in the floor of the closet and the little chamber underneath .
Parsing [sent. 1568 len. 10]: But at that he started up with glaring eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1569 len. 3]: `` Helen !
Parsing [sent. 1570 len. 8]: I remember now , '' he cried .
Parsing [sent. 1571 len. 8]: `` I knew it at the time !
Parsing [sent. 1572 len. 11]: Do n't you know I never could endure the place ?
Parsing [sent. 1573 len. 29]: I foresaw , as plainly as I see you now , that one day I should be crouching here for safety with a hideous crime on my conscience .
Parsing [sent. 1574 len. 11]: I told you so , Helen , at the time .
Parsing [sent. 1575 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 1576 len. 8]: how could you bring me here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1577 len. 14]: He threw himself down again , and hid his face on her lap .
Parsing [sent. 1578 len. 24]: With a fresh inroad of dismay Helen thought he must be going mad , for this was the merest trick of his imagination .
Parsing [sent. 1579 len. 21]: Certainly he had always dreaded the place , but never a word of that sort had he said to her .
Parsing [sent. 1580 len. 24]: Yet there was a shadow of possible comfort in the thought -- for , what if the whole thing should prove an hallucination !
Parsing [sent. 1581 len. 12]: But whether real or not , she must have his story .
Parsing [sent. 1582 len. 10]: `` Come , dearest Poldie , darling brother ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1583 len. 14]: she said , `` you have not yet told me what it is .
Parsing [sent. 1584 len. 9]: What is the terrible thing you have done ?
Parsing [sent. 1585 len. 12]: I daresay it 's nothing so very bad after all ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1586 len. 8]: `` There 's the light coming ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1587 len. 14]: he said , in a dull hollow voice , '' -- The morning !
Parsing [sent. 1588 len. 7]: always the morning coming again ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1589 len. 9]: `` No , no , dear Poldie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1590 len. 3]: she returned .
Parsing [sent. 1591 len. 31]: `` There is no window here -- at least it only looks on the back stair , high above heads ; and the morning is a long way off . ''
Parsing [sent. 1592 len. 5]: `` How far ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1593 len. 12]: he asked , staring in her eyes -- `` twenty years ?
Parsing [sent. 1594 len. 8]: That was just when I was bom !
Parsing [sent. 1595 len. 19]: Oh that I could enter a second time into my mother 's womb , and never be born !
Parsing [sent. 1596 len. 9]: Why are we sent into this cursed world ?
Parsing [sent. 1597 len. 8]: I would God had never made it .
Parsing [sent. 1598 len. 5]: What was the good ?
Parsing [sent. 1599 len. 9]: Could n't he have let well alone ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1600 len. 4]: He was silent .
Parsing [sent. 1601 len. 7]: She must get him to sleep .
Parsing [sent. 1602 len. 34]: It was as if a second soul had been given her to supplement the first , and enable her to meet what would otherwise have been the exorbitant demands now made upon her .
Parsing [sent. 1603 len. 83]: With an effort of the will such as she could never before have even imagined , she controlled the anguish of her own spirit , and , softly stroking the head of the poor lad , which had again sought her lap , compelled herself to sing him for lullaby a song of which in his childhood he had been very fond , and with which , in all the importance of imagined motherhood , she had often sung him to sleep .
Parsing [sent. 1604 len. 8]: And the old influence was potent yet .
Parsing [sent. 1605 len. 22]: In a few minutes the fingers which clutched her hand relaxed , and she knew by his breathing that he slept .
Parsing [sent. 1606 len. 56]: She sat still as a stone , not daring to move , hardly daring breathe enough to keep her alive , lest she should rouse him from his few blessed moments of self-nothingness , during which the tide of the all-infolding ocean of peace was free to flow into the fire-torn cave of his bosom .
Parsing [sent. 1607 len. 45]: She sat motionless thus , until it seemed as if for very weariness she must drop in a heap on the floor , but that the aches and pains which went through her in all directions held her body together like ties and rivets .
Parsing [sent. 1608 len. 19]: She had never before known what weariness was , and now she knew it for all her life .
Parsing [sent. 1609 len. 30]: But like an irritant , her worn body clung about her soul and dulled it to its own grief , thus helping it to a pitiful kind of repose .
Parsing [sent. 1610 len. 42]: How long she sat thus she could not tell -- she had no means of knowing , but it seemed hours on hours , and yet , though the nights were now short , the darkness had not begun to thin .
Parsing [sent. 1611 len. 37]: But when she thought how little access the light had to that room , she began to grow uneasy lest she should be missed from her own , or seen on her way back to it .
Parsing [sent. 1612 len. 8]: At length some involuntary movement woke him .
Parsing [sent. 1613 len. 12]: He started to his feet with a look of wild gladness .
Parsing [sent. 1614 len. 12]: But there was scarcely time to recognise it before it vanished .
Parsing [sent. 1615 len. 10]: `` My God , it is true then ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1616 len. 3]: he shrieked .
Parsing [sent. 1617 len. 21]: `` O Helen , I dreamed that I was innocent -- that I had but dreamed I had done it .
Parsing [sent. 1618 len. 8]: Tell me that I 'm dreaming now .
Parsing [sent. 1619 len. 3]: Tell me !
Parsing [sent. 1620 len. 3]: tell me !
Parsing [sent. 1621 len. 10]: -- Tell me that I am no murderer ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1622 len. 29]: As he spoke , he seized her shoulder with a fierce grasp , and shook her as if trying to wake her from the silence of a lethargy .
Parsing [sent. 1623 len. 10]: `` I hope you are innocent , my darling .
Parsing [sent. 1624 len. 18]: But in any case I will do all I can to protect you , '' said Helen .
Parsing [sent. 1625 len. 19]: `` Only I shall never be able unless you control yourself sufficiently to let me go home . ''
Parsing [sent. 1626 len. 6]: `` No , Helen ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1627 len. 10]: he cried ; `` you must not leave me .
Parsing [sent. 1628 len. 9]: If you do , I shall go mad .
Parsing [sent. 1629 len. 6]: SHE will come instead . ''
Parsing [sent. 1630 len. 10]: Helen shuddered inwardly , but kept her outward composure .
Parsing [sent. 1631 len. 20]: `` If I stay with you , just think , dearest , what will happen , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 1632 len. 18]: `` I shall be missed , and all the country will be raised to look for me .
Parsing [sent. 1633 len. 13]: They will think I have been -- '' -- She checked herself .
Parsing [sent. 1634 len. 30]: `` And so you might be -- so might anyone , '' he cried , `` so long as I am loose -- like the Rajah 's man-eating horse .
Parsing [sent. 1635 len. 3]: O God !
Parsing [sent. 1636 len. 7]: It has come to this ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1637 len. 9]: And he hid his face in his hands .
Parsing [sent. 1638 len. 39]: `` And then you see , my Poldie , '' Helen went on as calmly as she could , `` they would come here and find us ; and I do n't know what might come next . ''
Parsing [sent. 1639 len. 7]: `` Yes , yes , Helen !
Parsing [sent. 1640 len. 5]: Go , go directly .
Parsing [sent. 1641 len. 33]: Leave me this instant , '' he said , hurriedly , and took her by the shoulders , as if he would push her from the room , but went on talking .
Parsing [sent. 1642 len. 18]: `` It must be , I know ; but when the light comes I shall go mad .
Parsing [sent. 1643 len. 25]: Would to God I might , for the day is worse than the darkness ; then I see my own black against the light .
Parsing [sent. 1644 len. 5]: Now go , Helen .
Parsing [sent. 1645 len. 14]: But you WILL come back to me as soon as ever you can ?
Parsing [sent. 1646 len. 12]: How shall I know when to begin to look for you ?
Parsing [sent. 1647 len. 5]: What o'clock is it ?
Parsing [sent. 1648 len. 9]: My watch has never been -- since -- .
Parsing [sent. 1649 len. 2]: Ugh !
Parsing [sent. 1650 len. 7]: the light will be here soon .
Parsing [sent. 1651 len. 9]: Helen , I know now what hell is .
Parsing [sent. 1652 len. 3]: -- Ah !
Parsing [sent. 1653 len. 3]: Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1654 len. 14]: -- As he spoke he had been feeling in one of his pockets .
Parsing [sent. 1655 len. 9]: -- `` I will not be taken alive .
Parsing [sent. 1656 len. 8]: -- Can you whistle , Helen ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1657 len. 11]: `` Yes , Poldie , '' answered Helen , trembling .
Parsing [sent. 1658 len. 9]: `` Do n't you remember teaching me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1659 len. 5]: `` Yes , yes .
Parsing [sent. 1660 len. 33]: -- Then , when you come near the house , whistle , and go on whistling , for if I hear a step without any whistling , I shall kill myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 1661 len. 8]: `` What have you got there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1662 len. 20]: she asked in renewed terror , noticing that he kept his hand in the breast pocket of his coat .
Parsing [sent. 1663 len. 10]: `` Only the knife , '' he answered calmly .
Parsing [sent. 1664 len. 13]: `` Give it to me , '' she said , calmly too .
Parsing [sent. 1665 len. 13]: He laughed , and the laugh was more terrible than any cry .
Parsing [sent. 1666 len. 15]: `` No ; I 'm not so green as that , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1667 len. 8]: `` My knife is my only friend !
Parsing [sent. 1668 len. 12]: Who is to take care of me when you are away ?
Parsing [sent. 1669 len. 2]: Ha !
Parsing [sent. 1670 len. 3]: ha ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1671 len. 14]: She saw that the comfort of the knife must not be denied him .
Parsing [sent. 1672 len. 33]: Nor did she fear any visit that might drive him to its use -- except indeed the police WERE to come upon him -- and then -- what better could he do ?
Parsing [sent. 1673 len. 3]: she thought .
Parsing [sent. 1674 len. 15]: `` Well , well , I will not plague you , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 1675 len. 22]: `` Lie down and I will cover you with my shawl , and you can fancy it my arms round you .
Parsing [sent. 1676 len. 13]: I will come to you as soon as ever I can . ''
Parsing [sent. 1677 len. 3]: He obeyed .
Parsing [sent. 1678 len. 10]: She spread her shawl over him and kissed him .
Parsing [sent. 1679 len. 11]: `` Thank you , Helen , '' he said quietly .
Parsing [sent. 1680 len. 14]: `` Pray to God to deliver you , dear , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 1681 len. 14]: `` He can do that only by killing me , '' he returned .
Parsing [sent. 1682 len. 7]: `` I will pray for that .
Parsing [sent. 1683 len. 7]: But do you go , Helen .
Parsing [sent. 1684 len. 12]: I will try to bear my misery for your sake . ''
Parsing [sent. 1685 len. 19]: He followed her from the room with eyes out of which looked the very demon of silent despair .
Parsing [sent. 1686 len. 11]: I will not further attempt to set forth his feelings .
Parsing [sent. 1687 len. 15]: The incredible , the impossible , had become a fact-AND HE WAS THE MAN .
Parsing [sent. 1688 len. 52]: He who knows the relief of waking from a dream of crime to the jubilation of recovered innocence , to the sunlight that blots out the thing as untrue , may by help of that conceive the misery of a delicate nature suddenly filled with the clear assurance of horrible guilt .
Parsing [sent. 1689 len. 15]: Such a misery no waking but one that annihilated the past could ever console .
Parsing [sent. 1690 len. 53]: Yes , there is yet an awaking -- if a man might but attain unto it -- an awaking into a region whose very fields are full of the harmony sovereign to console , not merely for having suffered -- that needs little consoling , but for having inflicted the deepest wrong .
Parsing [sent. 1691 len. 54]: The moment Helen was out of sight , Leopold drew a small silver box from an inner pocket , eyed it with the eager look of a hungry animal , took from it a portion of a certain something , put it in his mouth , closed his eyes , and lay still .
Parsing [sent. 1692 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXIV .
Parsing [sent. 1693 len. 5]: HELEN WITH A SECRET .
Parsing [sent. 1694 len. 16]: When Helen came out into the corridor , she saw that the day was breaking .
Parsing [sent. 1695 len. 29]: A dim , dreary light filled the dismal house , but the candle had prevented her from perceiving the little of it that could enter that room withdrawn .
Parsing [sent. 1696 len. 24]: A pang of fear shot to her soul , and like a belated spectre or a roused somnambulist she fled across the park .
Parsing [sent. 1697 len. 17]: It was all so like a horrible dream , from which she must wake in bed !
Parsing [sent. 1698 len. 11]: yet she knew there was no such hope for her .
Parsing [sent. 1699 len. 22]: Her darling lay in that frightful house , and if anyone should see her , it might be death to him .
Parsing [sent. 1700 len. 27]: But yet it was very early , and two hours would pass before any of the workmen would be on their way to the new house .
Parsing [sent. 1701 len. 17]: Yet , like a murderer shaken out of the earth by the light , she fled .
Parsing [sent. 1702 len. 38]: When she was safe in her own room , ere she could get into bed , she once more turned deadly sick , and next knew by the agonies of coming to herself that she had fainted .
Parsing [sent. 1703 len. 9]: A troubled , weary , EXCITED sleep followed .
Parsing [sent. 1704 len. 25]: She woke with many a start , as if she had sinned in sleeping , and instantly for very weariness , dozed off again .
Parsing [sent. 1705 len. 6]: How kind is weariness sometimes !
Parsing [sent. 1706 len. 19]: It is like the Father 's hand laid a little heavy on the heart to make it still .
Parsing [sent. 1707 len. 27]: But her dreams were full of torture , and even when she had no definite dream , she was haunted by the vague presence of blood .
Parsing [sent. 1708 len. 20]: It was considerably past her usual time for rising when at length she heard her maid in the room .
Parsing [sent. 1709 len. 22]: She got up wearily , but beyond the heaviest of hearts and a general sense of misery , nothing ailed her .
Parsing [sent. 1710 len. 7]: Nor even did her head ache .
Parsing [sent. 1711 len. 42]: But she had lived an age since she woke last ; and the wonder was , not that she felt so different , but that she should be aware of being the same person as before notwithstanding all that had passed .
Parsing [sent. 1712 len. 15]: Her business now was to keep herself from thinking until breakfast should be over .
Parsing [sent. 1713 len. 37]: She must hold the `` ebony box '' of last night close shut even from her own eyes , lest the demons of which it was full should rush out and darken the world about her .
Parsing [sent. 1714 len. 35]: She hurried to her bath for strength : the friendly water would rouse her to the present , make the past recede like a dream , and give her courage to face the future .
Parsing [sent. 1715 len. 13]: Her very body seemed defiled by the knowledge that was within it .
Parsing [sent. 1716 len. 2]: Alas !
Parsing [sent. 1717 len. 8]: how must poor Leopold feel , then !
Parsing [sent. 1718 len. 6]: But she must not think .
Parsing [sent. 1719 len. 31]: All the time she was dressing , her thoughts kept hovering round the awful thing like moths around a foul flame , from which she could not drive them away .
Parsing [sent. 1720 len. 55]: Ever and again she said to herself that she must not , yet ever and again she found herself peeping through the chinks of the thought-chamber at the terrible thing inside -- the form of which she could not see -- saw only the colour -- red , -- red mingled with ghastly whiteness .
Parsing [sent. 1721 len. 29]: In all the world , her best-loved , her brother , the child of her grandfather , was the only one who knew how that thing came there .
Parsing [sent. 1722 len. 52]: But while Helen 's being was in such tumult that she could never more be the cool , indifferent , self-contented person she had hitherto been , her old habits and forms of existence were now of endless help to the retaining of her composure and the covering of her secret .
Parsing [sent. 1723 len. 59]: A dim gleam of gladness woke in her at the sight of the unfinished cap , than which she could not have a better excuse for her lateness , and when she showed it to her aunt with the wish of many happy returns of the day , no second glance from Mrs. Ramshorn added to her uneasiness .
Parsing [sent. 1724 len. 12]: But oh , how terribly the time crept in its going !
Parsing [sent. 1725 len. 39]: for she dared not approach the deserted house while the daylight kept watching it like a dog ; and what if Leopold should have destroyed himself in the madness of his despair before she could go to him !
Parsing [sent. 1726 len. 9]: She had not a friend to help her .
Parsing [sent. 1727 len. 3]: George Bascombe ?
Parsing [sent. 1728 len. 9]: -- she shuddered at the thought of him .
Parsing [sent. 1729 len. 18]: With his grand ideas of duty , he would be for giving up Leopold that very moment !
Parsing [sent. 1730 len. 18]: Naturally the clergyman was the one to go to -- and Mr. Wingfold had himself done wrong .
Parsing [sent. 1731 len. 6]: But he had confessed it !
Parsing [sent. 1732 len. 15]: No -- he was a poor creature , and would not hold his tongue !
Parsing [sent. 1733 len. 22]: She shook at every knock at the door , every ring at the bell , lest it should be the police .
Parsing [sent. 1734 len. 25]: To be sure , he had been comparatively little there , and naturally they would seek him first at Goldswyre -- but where next ?
Parsing [sent. 1735 len. 6]: At Glaston , of course .
Parsing [sent. 1736 len. 21]: Every time a servant entered the room she turned away , lest her ears should make her countenance a traitor .
Parsing [sent. 1737 len. 18]: The police might be watching the house , and might follow her when she went to him !
Parsing [sent. 1738 len. 28]: With her opera-glass , she examined the meadow , then ran to the bottom of the garden , and lying down , peered over the sunk fence .
Parsing [sent. 1739 len. 9]: But not a human being was in sight .
Parsing [sent. 1740 len. 25]: Next she put on her bonnet , with the pretence of shopping , to see if there were any suspicious-looking persons in the street .
Parsing [sent. 1741 len. 23]: But she did not meet a single person unknown to her between her aunt 's door and Mr. Drew the linendraper 's .
Parsing [sent. 1742 len. 36]: There she bought a pair of gloves , and walked quietly back , passing the house , and going on to the Abbey , without meeting one person at whom she had to look twice .
Parsing [sent. 1743 len. 26]: All the time her consciousness was like a single intense point of light in the middle of a darkness it could do nothing to illuminate .
Parsing [sent. 1744 len. 75]: She knew nothing but that her brother lay in that horrible empty house , and that , if his words were not the ravings of a maniac , the law , whether it yet suspected him or not , was certainly after him , and if it had not yet struck upon his trail , was every moment on the point of finding it , and must sooner or later come up with him .
Parsing [sent. 1745 len. 14]: She MUST save him -- all that was left of him to save !
Parsing [sent. 1746 len. 9]: But poor Helen knew very little about saving .
Parsing [sent. 1747 len. 46]: One thing more she became suddenly aware of as she re-entered the house -- the possession of a power of dissimulation , of hiding herself , hitherto strange to her , for hitherto she had had nothing , hardly even a passing dislike to conceal .
Parsing [sent. 1748 len. 40]: The consciousness brought only exultation with it , for her nature was not yet delicate enough to feel the jar of the thought that neither words nor looks must any more be an index to what lay within her .
Parsing [sent. 1749 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXV .
Parsing [sent. 1750 len. 4]: A DAYLIGHT VISIT .
Parsing [sent. 1751 len. 6]: But she could not rest .
Parsing [sent. 1752 len. 17]: When would the weary day be over , and the longed-for rather than welcome night appear ?
Parsing [sent. 1753 len. 22]: Again she went into the garden , and down to the end of it , and looked out over the meadow .
Parsing [sent. 1754 len. 30]: Not a creature was in sight , except a red and white cow , a child gathering buttercups , and a few rooks crossing from one field to another .
Parsing [sent. 1755 len. 16]: It was a glorious day ; the sun seemed the very centre of conscious peace .
Parsing [sent. 1756 len. 71]: And now first , strange to say , Helen began to know the bliss of bare existence under a divine sky , in the midst of a divine air , the two making a divine summer , which throbbed with the presence of the creative spirit -- but as something apart from her now , something she had had , but had lost , which could never more be hers .
Parsing [sent. 1757 len. 17]: How could she ever be glad again , with such a frightful fact in her soul !
Parsing [sent. 1758 len. 19]: Away there beyond those trees lay her unhappy brother , in the lonely house , now haunted indeed .
Parsing [sent. 1759 len. 6]: Perhaps he lay there dead !
Parsing [sent. 1760 len. 16]: The horrors of the morning , or his own hand , might have slain him .
Parsing [sent. 1761 len. 6]: She must go to him .
Parsing [sent. 1762 len. 16]: She would defy the very sun , and go in the face of the universe .
Parsing [sent. 1763 len. 6]: Was he not her brother ?
Parsing [sent. 1764 len. 7]: -- Was there no help anywhere ?
Parsing [sent. 1765 len. 35]: no mantle for this sense of soul-nakedness that had made her feel as if her awful secret might be read a mile away , lying crimson and livid in the bottom of her heart .
Parsing [sent. 1766 len. 25]: She dared hardly think of it , lest the very act should betray the thing of darkness to the world of light around her .
Parsing [sent. 1767 len. 18]: Nothing but the atmosphere of another innocent soul could shield hers , and she had no friend .
Parsing [sent. 1768 len. 11]: What did people do when their brothers did awful deeds ?
Parsing [sent. 1769 len. 27]: She had heard of praying to God -- had indeed herself told her brother to pray , but it was all folly -- worse , priestcraft .
Parsing [sent. 1770 len. 11]: As if such things AND a God could exist together !
Parsing [sent. 1771 len. 36]: Yet , even with the thought of denial in her mind , she looked up , and gazed earnestly into the wide innocent mighty space , as if by searching she might find some one .
Parsing [sent. 1772 len. 6]: Perhaps she OUGHT to pray .
Parsing [sent. 1773 len. 17]: She could see no likelihood of a God , and yet something pushed her towards prayer .
Parsing [sent. 1774 len. 15]: What if all this had come upon her and Poldie because she never prayed !
Parsing [sent. 1775 len. 63]: If there were such horrible things in the world , although she had never dreamed of them -- if they could come so near her , into her very soul , making her feel like a murderess , might there not be a God also , though she knew nothing of his whereabouts or how to reach him and gain a hearing ?
Parsing [sent. 1776 len. 49]: Certainly if things went with such hellish possibilities at the heart of them , and there was no hand at all to restrain or guide or restore , the world was a good deal worse place than either the Methodists or the Positivists made it out to be .
Parsing [sent. 1777 len. 43]: In the form of feelings , not of words , hardly even of thoughts , things like these passed through her mind as she stood on the top of the sunk fence and gazed across the flat of sunny green before her .
Parsing [sent. 1778 len. 21]: She could almost have slain herself to be rid of her knowledge and the awful consciousness that was its result .
Parsing [sent. 1779 len. 27]: SHE would have found no difficulty in that line of Macbeth : -- `` To know my deed , ` twere best not know myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 1780 len. 10]: -- But all this time there was her brother !
Parsing [sent. 1781 len. 6]: She MUST go to him .
Parsing [sent. 1782 len. 11]: `` God hide me , '' she cried within her .
Parsing [sent. 1783 len. 21]: `` But how can he hide me , '' she thought , `` when I am hiding a murderer ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1784 len. 27]: `` O God , '' she cried again , and this time in an audible murmur , `` I am his sister , thou knowest ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1785 len. 15]: Then she turned , walked back to the house , and sought her aunt .
Parsing [sent. 1786 len. 22]: `` I have got a little headache , '' she said quite coolly , `` and I want a long walk .
Parsing [sent. 1787 len. 7]: Do n't wait luncheon for me .
Parsing [sent. 1788 len. 7]: It is such a glorious day !
Parsing [sent. 1789 len. 13]: I shall go by the Millpool road , and across the park .
Parsing [sent. 1790 len. 10]: Good-bye till tea , or perhaps dinner-time even . ''
Parsing [sent. 1791 len. 14]: `` Had n't you better have a ride and be back to luncheon ?
Parsing [sent. 1792 len. 36]: I sha n't want Jones to-day , '' said her aunt mournfully , who , although she had almost given up birthdays , thought her niece need not quite desert her on the disagreeable occasion .
Parsing [sent. 1793 len. 12]: `` I 'm not in tne humour for riding , aunt .
Parsing [sent. 1794 len. 9]: Nothing will do me good but a walk .
Parsing [sent. 1795 len. 10]: I shall put some luncheon in my bag . ''
Parsing [sent. 1796 len. 32]: She went quietly out by the front door , walked slowly , softly , statelily along the street and out of the town , and entered the park by the lodge-gate .
Parsing [sent. 1797 len. 69]: She saw Rachel at her work in the kitchen as she passed , and heard her singing in a low and weak but very sweet voice , which went to her heart like a sting , making the tall , handsome , rich lady envy the poor distorted atom who , through all the fogs of her winter , had yet something in her that sought such utterance .
Parsing [sent. 1798 len. 43]: But , indeed , if all her misery had been swept away like a dream , Helen might yet have envied the dwarf ten times more than she did now , had she but known how they stood compared with each other .
Parsing [sent. 1799 len. 46]: For the being of Helen to that of Rachel was as a single , untwined primary cell to a finished brain ; as the peeping of a chicken to the song of a lark -- I had almost said , to a sonata of Beethoven .
Parsing [sent. 1800 len. 61]: `` Good day , Rachel , '' she said , calling as she passed , in a kindly , even then rather condescending voice , through the open door , where a pail of water , just set down , stood rocking the sun on its heaving surface , and flashing it out again into the ocean of the light .
Parsing [sent. 1801 len. 57]: It seemed to poor Helen a squalid abode , but it was a home-like palace , and fairly furnished , in comparison with the suburban villa and shop-upholstery which typified the house of her spirit -- now haunted by a terrible secret walking through its rooms , and laying a bloody hand upon all their whitenesses .
Parsing [sent. 1802 len. 28]: There was no sound all the way as she went but the noise of the birds , and an occasional clank from the new building far away .
Parsing [sent. 1803 len. 33]: At last , with beating heart and scared soul , she was within the high garden-wall , making her way through the rank growth of weeds and bushes to the dismal house .
Parsing [sent. 1804 len. 16]: She entered trembling , and the air felt as if death had been before her .
Parsing [sent. 1805 len. 17]: Hardly would her limbs carry her , but with slow step she reached the hidden room .
Parsing [sent. 1806 len. 8]: He lay as she had left him .
Parsing [sent. 1807 len. 7]: Was he asleep , or dead ?
Parsing [sent. 1808 len. 11]: She crept near and laid her hand on his forehead .
Parsing [sent. 1809 len. 11]: He started to his feet in an agony of fright .
Parsing [sent. 1810 len. 11]: She soothed and reassured him as best she was able .
Parsing [sent. 1811 len. 15]: When the paroxysm relaxed -- `` You did n't whistle , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1812 len. 16]: `` No ; I forgot , '' answered Helen , shocked at her own carelessness .
Parsing [sent. 1813 len. 19]: `` But if I had , you would not have heard me : you were fast asleep . ''
Parsing [sent. 1814 len. 7]: `` A good thing I was !
Parsing [sent. 1815 len. 4]: And yet no !
Parsing [sent. 1816 len. 21]: I wish I had heard you , for then by this time I should have been beyond their reach . ''
Parsing [sent. 1817 len. 12]: Impulsively he showed her the short dangerous looking weapon he carried .
Parsing [sent. 1818 len. 18]: Helen stretched out her hand to take it , but he hurriedly replaced it in his pocket .
Parsing [sent. 1819 len. 16]: `` I will find some water for you to wash with , '' said Helen .
Parsing [sent. 1820 len. 14]: `` There used to be a well in the garden , I remember .
Parsing [sent. 1821 len. 8]: I have brought you a shirt . ''
Parsing [sent. 1822 len. 51]: With some difficulty she found the well , all but lost in matted weeds under an ivy-tod , and in the saucer of a flower-pot she carried him some water , and put the garment with the horrible spot in her bag , to take it away and destroy it .
Parsing [sent. 1823 len. 8]: Then she made him eat and drink .
Parsing [sent. 1824 len. 15]: He did whatever she told him , with a dull , yet doglike obedience .
Parsing [sent. 1825 len. 22]: His condition was much changed ; he had a stupefied look , and seemed only half awake to his terrible situation .
Parsing [sent. 1826 len. 28]: Yet he answered what questions she put to him even too readily -- with an indifferent matter-of-factness , indeed , more dreadful than any most passionate outburst .
Parsing [sent. 1827 len. 27]: But at the root of the apparent apathy lay despair and remorse , -- weary , like gorged and sleeping tigers far back in their dens .
Parsing [sent. 1828 len. 22]: Only the dull torpedo of misery was awake , lying motionless on the bottom of the deepest pool of his spirit .
Parsing [sent. 1829 len. 34]: The mood was favourable to the drawing of his story from him , but there are more particulars in the narrative I am now going to give than Helen at that time learned .
Parsing [sent. 1830 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXVI .
Parsing [sent. 1831 len. 4]: LEOPOLD 'S STORY .
Parsing [sent. 1832 len. 52]: While yet a mere boy , scarcely more than sixteen , Leopold had made acquaintance with the family of a certain manufacturer , who , having retired from business with a rapidly-gained fortune , had some years before purchased an estate a few miles from Goldswyre , his uncle 's place .
Parsing [sent. 1833 len. 35]: Their settling in the neighbourhood was not welcome to the old-fashioned , long-rooted family of the Lingards ; but although they had not called upon them , they could not help meeting them occasionally .
Parsing [sent. 1834 len. 34]: Leopold 's association with them commenced just after he had left Eton , between which time and his going up to Cambridge he spent a year in reading with his cousins ' tutor .
Parsing [sent. 1835 len. 16]: It was at a ball he first saw Emmeline , the eldest of the family .
Parsing [sent. 1836 len. 23]: She had but lately returned from a school at which from the first she had had for her bedfellow a black ewe .
Parsing [sent. 1837 len. 70]: It was not a place where any blackness under that of pitch was likely to attract notice , being one of those very ordinary and very common schools where everything is done that is done , first for manners , then for accomplishments , and lastly for information , leaving all the higher faculties and endowments of the human being as entirely unconsidered as if they had no existence .
Parsing [sent. 1838 len. 50]: Taste , feeling , judgment , imagination , conscience , are in such places left to look after themselves , and the considerations presented to them , and duties required of them as religious , are only fitted to lower still farther such moral standard as they may possess .
Parsing [sent. 1839 len. 89]: Schools of this kind send out , as their quota of the supply of mothers for the ages to come , young women who will consult a book of etiquette as to what is ladylike ; who always think what is the mode , never what is beautiful ; who read romances in which the wickedness is equalled only by the shallowness ; who write questions to weekly papers concerning points of behaviour , and place their whole , or chief delight in making themselves attractive to men .
Parsing [sent. 1840 len. 44]: Some such girls look lady-like and interesting , and many of them are skilled in the arts that meet their fullest development in a nature whose sense of existence is rounded by its own reflection in the mirror of self-consciousness falsified by vanity .
Parsing [sent. 1841 len. 85]: Once understood , they are for a sadness or a loathing , after the nature that understands them ; till then , they are to the beholder such as they desire to appear , while under the fair outside lies a nature whose vulgarity , if the most thorough of changes do not in the meantime supervene , will manifest itself hideously on the approach of middle age , that is , by the time when habituation shall have destroyed the restraints of diffidence .
Parsing [sent. 1842 len. 43]: Receiving ever fresh and best assurance of their own consequence in the attention and admiration of men , such girls are seldom capable of any real attachment , and the marvel is that so few of them comparatively disgrace themselves after marriage .
Parsing [sent. 1843 len. 118]: Whether it was the swarthy side of his nature , early ripened under the hot Indian sun , that found itself irresistibly drawn to the widening of its humanity in the flaxen fairness of Emmeline , or the Saxon element in him seeking back to its family -- it might indeed have been both , our nature admitting of such marvellous complexity in its unity , -- he fell in love with her , if not in the noblest yet in a very genuine , though at the same time very passionate way ; and as she had , to use a Scots proverb , a crop for all corn , his attentions were acceptable to her .
Parsing [sent. 1844 len. 67]: Had she been true-hearted enough to know anything of that love whose name was for ever suffering profanation upon her lips , she would , being at least a year and a half older than he , have been too much of a woman to encourage his approaches -- would have felt he was a boy and must not be allowed to fancy himself a man .
Parsing [sent. 1845 len. 16]: But to be just , he did look to English eyes older than he was .
Parsing [sent. 1846 len. 46]: And then he was very handsome , distinguished-looking , of a good family , which could in no sense be said of her , -- and with high connections -- at the same time a natural contrast to herself , and personally attractive to her .
Parsing [sent. 1847 len. 42]: The first moment she saw his great black eyes blaze , she accepted the homage , laid it on the altar of her self-worship , and ever after sought to see them lighted up afresh in worship of her only divinity .
Parsing [sent. 1848 len. 44]: To be feelingly aware of her power over him , to play upon him as on an instrument , to make his cheek pale or glow , his eyes flash or fill , as she pleased , was a game almost too delightful .
Parsing [sent. 1849 len. 69]: One of the most potent means for producing the humano-atmospheric play in which her soul thus rejoiced , and one whose operation was to none better known than to Emmeline , was jealousy , and for its generation she had all possible facilities -- for there could not be a woman in regard of whom jealousy was more justifiable on any ground except that of being worth it .
Parsing [sent. 1850 len. 69]: So far as it will reach , however , it must be remembered , in mitigation of judgment , that she had no gauge in herself equal to the representation of a tithe of the misery whose signs served to lift her to the very Paradise of falsehood : she knew not what she did , and possibly knowledge might have found in her some pity and abstinence .
Parsing [sent. 1851 len. 45]: But when a woman , in her own nature cold , takes delight in rousing passion , she will , selfishly confident in her own safety , go to strange lengths in kindling and fanning the flame which is the death of the other .
Parsing [sent. 1852 len. 27]: It is far from my intention to follow the disagreeable topic across the pathless swamp through which an elaboration of its phases would necessarily drag me .
Parsing [sent. 1853 len. 28]: Of morbid anatomy , save for the setting forth of cure , I am not fond , and here there is nothing to be said of cure .
Parsing [sent. 1854 len. 41]: What concerns me as a narrator is , that Emmeline consoled and irritated and re-consoled Leopold , until she had him her very slave , and the more her slave that by that time he knew something of her character .
Parsing [sent. 1855 len. 55]: The knowledge took from him what little repose she had left him ; he did no more good at school , and went to Cambridge with the conviction that the woman to whom he had given his soul , would be doing things in his absence the sight of which would drive him mad .
Parsing [sent. 1856 len. 39]: Yet somehow he continued to live , reassured now and then by the loving letters she wrote to him , and relieving his own heart while he fostered her falsehood by the passionate replies he made to them .
Parsing [sent. 1857 len. 74]: From a sad accident of his childhood , he had become acquainted with something of the influences of a certain baneful drug , to the use of which one of his attendants was addicted , and now at college , partly from curiosity , partly from a desire to undergo its effects , but chiefly in order to escape from ever-gnawing and passionate thought , he began to make EXPERIMENTS in its use .
Parsing [sent. 1858 len. 136]: Experiment called for repetition -- in order to verification , said the fiend , -- and repetition led first to a longing after its effects , and next to a mad appetite for the thing itself ; so that , by the time of which my narrative treats , he was on the verge of absolute slavery to its use , and in imminent peril of having to pass the rest of his life in alternations of ecstasy and agony , divided by dull spaces of misery , the ecstasies growing rarer and rarer , and the agonies more and more frequent , intense , and lasting ; until at length the dethroned Apollo found himself chained to a pillar of his own ruined temple , which the sirocco was fast filling with desert sand .
Parsing [sent. 1859 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXVII .
Parsing [sent. 1860 len. 5]: LEOPOLD 'S STORY CONCLUDED .
Parsing [sent. 1861 len. 33]: He knew from her letters that they were going to give a ball , at which as many as pleased should be welcome in fancy dresses , and masked if they chose .
Parsing [sent. 1862 len. 118]: The night before it he had a dream , under the influence of his familiar no doubt , which made him so miserable and jealous that he longed to see her as a wounded man longs for water , and the thought arose of going down to the ball , not exactly in disguise , for he had no mind to act a part , but masked so that he should not be recognised as uninvited , and should have an opportunity of watching Emmeline , concerning whose engagement with a young cavalry officer there had lately been reports , which , however , before his dream , had caused him less uneasiness than many such preceding .
Parsing [sent. 1863 len. 9]: The same moment the thought was a resolve .
Parsing [sent. 1864 len. 29]: I must mention that no one whatever knew the degree of his intimacy with Emmeline , or that he had any ground for considering her engaged to him .
Parsing [sent. 1865 len. 11]: Secrecy added much to the zest of Emmeline 's pleasures .
Parsing [sent. 1866 len. 18]: Everyone knew that he was a devoted admirer -- but therein to be classed with a host .
Parsing [sent. 1867 len. 22]: For concealment , he contented himself with a large travelling-cloak , a tall felt hat , and a black silk mask .
Parsing [sent. 1868 len. 43]: He entered the grounds with an arrival of guests , and knowing the place perfectly , contrived to see something of her behaviour , while he watched for an opportunity of speaking to her alone , -- a quest of unlikely success .
Parsing [sent. 1869 len. 17]: Hour after hour he watched , and all the time never spoke or was spoken to .
Parsing [sent. 1870 len. 48]: Those who are acquainted with the mode of operation of the drug to which I have referred , are aware that a man may be fully under its influences without betraying to the ordinary observer that he is in a condition differing from that of other men .
Parsing [sent. 1871 len. 81]: But , in the living dream wherein he walks , his feeling of time and of space is so enlarged , or perhaps , I rather think , so subdivided to the consciousness , that everything about him seems infinite both in duration and extent ; the action of a second has in it a multitudinous gradation of progress , and a line of space is marked out into millionths , of every one of which the consciousness takes note .
Parsing [sent. 1872 len. 158]: At the same time his senses are open to every impression from things around him , only they appear to him in a strangely exalted metamorphosis , the reflex of his own mental exaltation either in bliss or torture , while the fancies of a man mingle with the facts thus introduced and modify and are in turn modified by them ; whereby out of the chaos arises the mountain of an Earthly Paradise , whose roots are in the depths of hell ; and whether the man be with the divine air and the clear rivers and the thousand-hued flowers on the top , or down in the ice-lake with the tears frozen to hard lumps in the hollows of his eyes so that he can no more have even the poor consolation of weeping , is but the turning of a hair , so far at least as his will has to do with it .
Parsing [sent. 1873 len. 56]: The least intrusion of anything painful , of any jar that can not be wrought into the general harmony of the vision , will suddenly alter its character , and from the seventh heaven of speechless bliss the man may fall plumb down into gulfs of horrible and torturing , it may be loathsome imaginings .
Parsing [sent. 1874 len. 33]: Now Leopold had taken a dose of the drug on his journey , and it was later than usual , probably because of the motion , ere it began to take effect .
Parsing [sent. 1875 len. 75]: He had indeed ceased to look for any result from it , when all at once , as he stood amongst the laburnums and lilacs of a rather late spring , something seemed to burst in his brain , and that moment he was Endymion waiting for Diana in her interlunar grove , while the music of the spheres made the blossoms of a stately yet flowering forest , tremble all with conscious delight .
Parsing [sent. 1876 len. 12]: Emboldened by his new condition , he drew nigh the house .
Parsing [sent. 1877 len. 109]: They were then passing from the ball to the supper-room , and he found the tumult so distasteful to his mood of still ecstasy that he would not have entered had he not remembered that he had in his pocket a note ready if needful to slip into her hand , containing only the words , `` Meet me for one long minute at the circle , '' -- a spot well known to both : he threw his cloak Spanish fashion over his left shoulder , slouched his hat , and entering stood in a shadowy spot she must pass in going to or from the supper-room .
Parsing [sent. 1878 len. 32]: There he waited , with the note hid in his hand -- a long time , yet not a weary one , such visions of loveliness passed before his entranced gaze .
Parsing [sent. 1879 len. 27]: At length SHE also passed -- lovely as the Diana whose dress she had copied -- not quite so perfectly as she had abjured her manners .
Parsing [sent. 1880 len. 18]: She leaned trustingly on the arm of some one , but Leopold never even looked at him .
Parsing [sent. 1881 len. 15]: He slid the note into her hand , which hung ungloved as inviting confidences .
Parsing [sent. 1882 len. 54]: With an instinct quickened and sharpened tenfold by much practice , her fingers instantly closed upon it , but , not a muscle belonging to any other part of her betrayed the intrusion of a foreign body : I do not believe her heart gave one beat the more to the next minute .
Parsing [sent. 1883 len. 34]: She passed graceful on , her swan 's - neck shining ; and Leopold hastened out to one of the windows of the ball-room , there to feast his eyes upon her loveliness .
Parsing [sent. 1884 len. 108]: But when he caught sight of her whirling in the waltz with the officer of dragoons whose name he had heard coupled with hers , and saw her flash on him the light and power of eyes which were to him the windows of all the heaven he knew , as they swam together in the joy of the rhythm , of the motion , of the music , suddenly the whole frame of the dream wherein he wandered , trembled , shook , fell down into the dreary vaults that underlie all the airy castles that have other foundation than the will of the eternal Builder .
Parsing [sent. 1885 len. 38]: With the suddenness of the dark that follows the lightning , the music changed to a dissonant clash of multitudinous cymbals , the resounding clang of brazen doors , and the hundred-toned screams of souls in torture .
Parsing [sent. 1886 len. 136]: The same moment , from halls of infinite scope , where the very air was a soft tumult of veiled melodies ever and anon twisted into inextricable knots of harmony -- under whose skyey domes he swept upborne by chords of sound throbbing up against great wings mighty as thought yet in their motions as easy and subtle , he found himself lying on the floor of a huge vault , whose black slabs were worn into many hollows by the bare feet of the damned as they went and came between the chambers of their torture opening off upon every side , whence issued all kinds of sickening cries , and mingled with the music to which , with whips of steel , hellish executioners urged the dance whose every motion was an agony .
Parsing [sent. 1887 len. 11]: His soul fainted within him , and the vision changed .
Parsing [sent. 1888 len. 28]: When he came to himself , he lay on the little plot of grass amongst the lilacs and laburnums where he had asked Emmeline to meet him .
Parsing [sent. 1889 len. 32]: Fevered with jealousy and the horrible drug , his mouth was parched like an old purse , and he found himself chewing at the grass to ease its burning and drought .
Parsing [sent. 1890 len. 14]: But presently the evil thing resumed its sway and fancies usurped over facts .
Parsing [sent. 1891 len. 34]: He thought he was lying in an Indian jungle , close by the cave of a beautiful tigress , which crouched within , waiting the first sting of reviving hunger to devour him .
Parsing [sent. 1892 len. 56]: He could hear her breathing as she slept , but he was fascinated , paralyzed , and could not escape , knowing that , even if with mighty effort he succeeded in moving a finger , the motion would suffice to wake her , and she would spring upon him and tear him to pieces .
Parsing [sent. 1893 len. 24]: Years upon years passed thus , and he still lay on the grass in the jungle , and still the beautiful tigress slept .
Parsing [sent. 1894 len. 60]: But however far apart the knots upon the string of time may lie , they must pass : an angel in white stood over him , his fears vanished , the waving of her wings cooled him , and she was the angel whom he had loved and loved from all eternity , in whom was his ever-and-only rest .
Parsing [sent. 1895 len. 24]: She lifted him to his feet , gave him her hand , they walked away , and the tigress was asleep for ever .
Parsing [sent. 1896 len. 71]: For miles and miles , as it seemed to his exaltation , they wandered away into the woods , to wander in them for ever , the same violet blue , flashing with roseate stars , for ever looking in through the tree-tops , and the great leafy branches hushing , ever hushing them , as with the voices of child-watching mothers , into peace , whose depth is bliss .
Parsing [sent. 1897 len. 12]: `` Have you nothing to say now I am come ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1898 len. 4]: said the angel .
Parsing [sent. 1899 len. 6]: `` I have said all .
Parsing [sent. 1900 len. 10]: I am at rest , '' answered the mortal .
Parsing [sent. 1901 len. 16]: `` I am going to be married to Captain Hodges , '' said the angel .
Parsing [sent. 1902 len. 46]: And with the word , the forests of heaven vanished , and the halls of Eblis did not take their place : -- a worse hell was there -- the cold reality of an earth abjured , and a worthless maiden walking by his side .
Parsing [sent. 1903 len. 7]: He stood and turned to her .
Parsing [sent. 1904 len. 7]: The shock had mastered the drug .
Parsing [sent. 1905 len. 16]: They were only in the little wooded hollow , a hundred yards from the house .
Parsing [sent. 1906 len. 14]: The blood throbbed in his head as from the piston of an engine .
Parsing [sent. 1907 len. 10]: A horrid sound of dance-music was in his ears .
Parsing [sent. 1908 len. 38]: Emmeline , his own , stood in her white dress , looking up in his face , with the words just parted from her lips , `` I am going to be married to Captain Hodges . ''
Parsing [sent. 1909 len. 26]: The next moment she threw her arms round his neck , pulled his face to hers , and kissed him , and clung to him .
Parsing [sent. 1910 len. 5]: `` Poor Leopold ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1911 len. 25]: she said , and looked in his face with her electric battery at full power ; `` does it make him miserable , then ?
Parsing [sent. 1912 len. 19]: -- But you know it could not have gone on like this between you and me for ever !
Parsing [sent. 1913 len. 17]: It was very dear while it lasted , but it must come to an end . ''
Parsing [sent. 1914 len. 14]: Was there a glimmer of real pity and sadness in those wondrous eyes ?
Parsing [sent. 1915 len. 13]: She laughed -- was it a laugh of despair or of exultation ?
Parsing [sent. 1916 len. 9]: -- and hid her face on his bosom .
Parsing [sent. 1917 len. 9]: And what was it that awoke in Leopold ?
Parsing [sent. 1918 len. 9]: Had the drug resumed its power over him ?
Parsing [sent. 1919 len. 14]: Was it rage at her mockery , or infinite compassion for her despair ?
Parsing [sent. 1920 len. 14]: Would he slay a demon , or ransom a spirit from hateful bonds ?
Parsing [sent. 1921 len. 12]: Would he save a woman from disgrace and misery to come ?
Parsing [sent. 1922 len. 8]: or punish her for the vilest falsehood ?
Parsing [sent. 1923 len. 4]: Who can tell ?
Parsing [sent. 1924 len. 6]: for Leopold himself never could .
Parsing [sent. 1925 len. 32]: Whatever the feeling was , its own violence erased it from his memory , and left him with a knife in his hand , and Emmeline lying motionless at his feet .
Parsing [sent. 1926 len. 57]: It was a knife the Scotch highlanders call a skean-dhu , sharp-pointed as a needle , sharp-edged as a razor , and with one blow of it he had cleft her heart , and she never cried or laughed any more in that body whose charms she had degraded to the vile servitude of her vanity .
Parsing [sent. 1927 len. 24]: The next thing he remembered was standing on the edge of the shaft of a deserted coalpit , ready to cast himself down .
Parsing [sent. 1928 len. 24]: Whence came the change of resolve , he could not tell , but he threw in his cloak and mask , and fled .
Parsing [sent. 1929 len. 11]: The one thought in his miserable brain was his sister .
Parsing [sent. 1930 len. 13]: Having murdered one woman , he was fleeing to another for refuge .
Parsing [sent. 1931 len. 5]: Helen would save him .
Parsing [sent. 1932 len. 16]: How he had found his way to his haven , he had not an idea .
Parsing [sent. 1933 len. 34]: Searching the newspapers , Helen heard that a week had elapsed between the `` mysterious murder of a young lady in Yorkshire '' and the night on which he came to her window .
Parsing [sent. 1934 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXVIII .
Parsing [sent. 1935 len. 2]: SISTERHOOD .
Parsing [sent. 1936 len. 16]: `` Well , Poldie , after all I would rather be you than she ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1937 len. 12]: cried Helen indignantly , when she had learned the whole story .
Parsing [sent. 1938 len. 23]: It was far from the wisest thing to say , but she meant it , and clasped her brother to her bosom .
Parsing [sent. 1939 len. 37]: Straightway the poor fellow began to search for all that man could utter in excuse , nay in justification , not of himself , but of the woman he had murdered , appropriating all the blame .
Parsing [sent. 1940 len. 45]: But Helen had recognised in Emmeline the selfishness which is the essential murderer , nor did it render her more lenient towards her that the same moment , with a start of horror , she caught a transient glimpse of the same in herself .
Parsing [sent. 1941 len. 24]: But the discovery wrought in the other direction , and the tenderness she now lavished upon Leopold left all his hopes far behind .
Parsing [sent. 1942 len. 43]: Her brother 's sin had broken wide the feebly-flowing springs of her conscience , and she saw that in idleness and ease and drowsiness of soul , she had been forgetting and neglecting even the being she loved best in the universe .
Parsing [sent. 1943 len. 72]: In the rushing confluence of love , truth , and indignation , to atone for years of half-love , half-indifference , as the past now appeared to her , she would have spoiled him terribly , heaping on him caresses and assurances that he was far the less guilty and the more injured of the two ; but Leopold 's strength was exhausted , and he fell back in a faint .
Parsing [sent. 1944 len. 14]: While she was occupied with his restoration many things passed through her mind .
Parsing [sent. 1945 len. 78]: Amongst the rest she saw it would be impossible for her to look after him sufficiently where he was , that the difficulty of feeding him even would be great , that very likely he was on the borders of an illness , when he would require constant attention , that the danger of discovery was great -- in short , that some better measures must be taken for his protection and the possibility of her ministrations .
Parsing [sent. 1946 len. 9]: If she had but a friend to consult !
Parsing [sent. 1947 len. 5]: Ever that thought returned .
Parsing [sent. 1948 len. 2]: Alas !
Parsing [sent. 1949 len. 13]: she had none on whose counsel or discretion either she could depend .
Parsing [sent. 1950 len. 34]: When at length he opened his eyes , she told him she must leave him now , but when it was dark she would come again , and stay with him till dawn .
Parsing [sent. 1951 len. 19]: Feebly he assented , seeming but half aware of what she said , and again closed his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1952 len. 12]: While he lay thus , she gained possession of his knife .
Parsing [sent. 1953 len. 16]: It left its sheath behind it , and she put it naked in her pocket .
Parsing [sent. 1954 len. 76]: As she went from the room , feeling like a mother abandoning her child in a wolf-haunted forest , his eyes followed her to the door with a longing , wild , hungry look , and she felt the look following her still through the wood and across the park and into her chamber , while the knife in her pocket felt like a spellbound demon waiting his chance to work them both a mischief .
Parsing [sent. 1955 len. 49]: She locked her door and took it out , and as she put it carefully away , fearful lest any attempt to destroy it might lead to its discovery , she caught sight of her brother 's name engraved in full upon the silver mounting of the handle .
Parsing [sent. 1956 len. 11]: `` What if he had left it behind him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1957 len. 6]: she thought with a shudder .
Parsing [sent. 1958 len. 14]: But a reassuring strength had risen in her mind with Leopold 's disclosure .
Parsing [sent. 1959 len. 37]: More than once on her way home she caught herself reasoning that the poor boy had not been to blame at all -- that he could not help it -- that she had deserved nothing less .
Parsing [sent. 1960 len. 20]: Her conscience speedily told her that in consenting to such a thought , she herself would be a murderess .
Parsing [sent. 1961 len. 34]: Love her brother she must ; excuse him she might , for honest excuse is only justice ; but to uphold the deed would be to take the part of hell against heaven .
Parsing [sent. 1962 len. 33]: Still the murder did not , would not seem so frightful after she had heard the whole tale , and she found it now required far less effort to face her aunt .
Parsing [sent. 1963 len. 33]: If she was not the protectress of the innocent , she was of the grievously wronged , and the worst wrong done him was the crime he had been driven to do .
Parsing [sent. 1964 len. 51]: She lay down and slept until dinner time , woke refreshed , and sustained her part during the slow meal , neartened by the expectation of seeing her brother again and in circumstance of less anxiety when the friendly darkness had come , and all eyes but theirs were closed .
Parsing [sent. 1965 len. 42]: She talked to her aunt and a lady who dined with them as if she had the freest heart in the world ; the time passed ; the converse waned ; the hour arrived ; adieus were said ; drowsiness came .
Parsing [sent. 1966 len. 48]: All the world of Glaston was asleep ; the night on her nest was brooding upon the egg of to-morrow ; the moon was in darkness ; and the wind was blowing upon Helen 's hot forehead , as she slid like a thief across the park .
Parsing [sent. 1967 len. 20]: Her mind was in a tumult of mingled feelings , all gathered about the form of her precious brother .
Parsing [sent. 1968 len. 107]: One moment she felt herself ministering to the father she had loved so dearly , in protecting his son ; the next the thought of her father had vanished , and all was love for the boy whose memories filled the shadow of her childhood ; about whom she had dreamed night after night as he crossed the great sea to come to her ; who had crept into her arms timidly , and straightway turned into the daintiest merriest playmate ; who had charmed her even in his hot-blooded rages , when he rushed at her with whatever was in his hand at the moment .
Parsing [sent. 1969 len. 14]: Then she had laughed and dared him ; now she shuddered to remember .
Parsing [sent. 1970 len. 55]: Again , and this was the feeling that generally prevailed , she was a vessel overflowing with the mere woman-passion of protection : the wronged , abused , maddened , oppressed , hunted human thing was dependent upon her , and her alone , for any help or safety he was ever to find .
Parsing [sent. 1971 len. 28]: Sometimes it was the love of a mother for her sick child ; sometimes that of a tigress crouching over her wounded cub and licking its hurts .
Parsing [sent. 1972 len. 23]: All was coloured with admiration of his beauty and grace , and mingled with boundless pity for their sad overclouding and defeature !
Parsing [sent. 1973 len. 18]: Nor was the sense of wrong to herself in wrong to her own flesh and blood wanting .
Parsing [sent. 1974 len. 18]: The sum of all was a passionate devotion of her being to the service of her brother .
Parsing [sent. 1975 len. 24]: I suspect that at root the loves of the noble wife , the great-souled mother , and the true sister , are one .
Parsing [sent. 1976 len. 20]: Anyhow , they are all but glints on the ruffled waters of humanity of the one changeless enduring Light .
Parsing [sent. 1977 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXIX .
Parsing [sent. 1978 len. 3]: THE SICK-CHAMBER .
Parsing [sent. 1979 len. 37]: She had reached the little iron gate , which hung on one hinge only , and was lifting it from the ground to push it open , when sudden through the stillness came a frightful cry .
Parsing [sent. 1980 len. 6]: Had they found him already ?
Parsing [sent. 1981 len. 9]: Was it a life-and-death struggle going on within ?
Parsing [sent. 1982 len. 15]: For one moment she stood rooted ; the next she flew to the door .
Parsing [sent. 1983 len. 16]: When she entered the hall , however , the place was silent as a crypt .
Parsing [sent. 1984 len. 7]: Could it have been her imagination ?
Parsing [sent. 1985 len. 20]: Again , curdling her blood with horror , came the tearing cry , a sort of shout of agony .
Parsing [sent. 1986 len. 34]: All in the dark , she flew up the stair , calling him by name , fell twice , rose as if on wings , and flew again until she reached the room .
Parsing [sent. 1987 len. 7]: There all was silence and darkness .
Parsing [sent. 1988 len. 35]: With trembling hands she found her match-box and struck a light , uttering all the time every soothing word she could think of , while her heart quavered in momentary terror of another shriek .
Parsing [sent. 1989 len. 36]: It came just as the match flamed up in her fingers , and an answering shriek from her bosom tore its way through her clenched teeth , and she shuddered like one in an ague .
Parsing [sent. 1990 len. 20]: There sat her brother on the edge of the bedstead staring before him with fixed eyes and terror-stricken countenance .
Parsing [sent. 1991 len. 18]: He had not heard her enter , and saw neither the light nor her who held it .
Parsing [sent. 1992 len. 38]: She made haste to light the candle , with mighty effort talking to him still , in gasps and chokings , but in vain ; the ghastly face continued unchanged , and the wide-open eyes remained fixed .
Parsing [sent. 1993 len. 13]: She seated herself beside him , and threw her arms around him .
Parsing [sent. 1994 len. 16]: It was like embracing a marble statue , so moveless , so irresponsive was he .
Parsing [sent. 1995 len. 46]: But presently he gave a kind of shudder , the tension of his frame relaxed , and the soul which had been absorbed in its own visions , came forward to its windows , cast from them a fleeting glance , then dropped the curtains .
Parsing [sent. 1996 len. 8]: `` Is it you , Helen ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1997 len. 18]: he said , shuddering , as he closed his eyes and laid his head on her shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 1998 len. 9]: His breath was like that of a furnace .
Parsing [sent. 1999 len. 6]: His skin seemed on fire .
Parsing [sent. 2000 len. 9]: She felt his pulse : it was galloping .
Parsing [sent. 2001 len. 17]: He was in a fever -- brain-fever , probably , and what was she to do ?
Parsing [sent. 2002 len. 6]: A thought came to her .
Parsing [sent. 2003 len. 9]: Yes , it was the only possible thing .
Parsing [sent. 2004 len. 6]: She would take him home .
Parsing [sent. 2005 len. 24]: There , with the help of the household , she might have a chance of concealing him -- a poor one , certainly !
Parsing [sent. 2006 len. 18]: but here , how was she even to keep him to the house in his raving fits ?
Parsing [sent. 2007 len. 6]: `` Poldie , dear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2008 len. 10]: she said , `` you must come with me .
Parsing [sent. 2009 len. 24]: I am going to take you to my own room , where I can nurse you properly , and need not leave you .
Parsing [sent. 2010 len. 10]: Do you think you could walk as far ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2011 len. 3]: `` Walk !
Parsing [sent. 2012 len. 9]: Yes -- quite well : why not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2013 len. 46]: `` I am afraid you are going to be ill , Poldie ; but , however ill you may feel , you must promise me to try and make as little noise as you can , and never cry out if you can help it .
Parsing [sent. 2014 len. 26]: When I do like this , '' she went on , laying her finger on his lips , `` you must be silent altogether . ''
Parsing [sent. 2015 len. 35]: `` I will do whatever you tell me , Helen , if you will only promise not to leave me , and , when they come for me , to give me poison . ''
Parsing [sent. 2016 len. 17]: She promised , and made haste to obliterate every sign that the room had been occupied .
Parsing [sent. 2017 len. 10]: She then took his arm and led him out .
Parsing [sent. 2018 len. 49]: He was very quiet -- too quiet and submissive , she thought -- seemed sleepy , revived a little when they reached the open air , presently grew terrified , and kept starting and looking about him as they crossed the park , but never spoke a word .
Parsing [sent. 2019 len. 42]: By the door in the sunk fence they reached the garden , and were soon in Helen 's chamber , where she left him to get into bed while she went to acquaint her aunt of his presence in the house .
Parsing [sent. 2020 len. 35]: Hard and unreasonable , like most human beings , where her prejudices were concerned , she had , like all other women , sympathy with those kinds of suffering which by experience she understood .
Parsing [sent. 2021 len. 23]: Mental distress was beyond her , but for the solace of another 's pain she would even have endured a portion herself .
Parsing [sent. 2022 len. 59]: When therefore , she heard Helen 's story , how her brother had come to her window , that he was ill with brain-fever , as she thought , and talked wildly , she quite approved of her having put him to bed in her own room , and would have got up to help in nursing him .
Parsing [sent. 2023 len. 47]: But Helen persuaded her to have her night 's rest , and begged her to join with her in warning the servants not to mention his presence in the house , on the ground that it might get abroad that he was out of his mind .
Parsing [sent. 2024 len. 27]: They were all old and tolerably faithful , and Leopold had been from childhood such a favourite , that she hoped thus to secure their silence .
Parsing [sent. 2025 len. 16]: `` But , child , he must have the doctor , '' said her aunt .
Parsing [sent. 2026 len. 9]: `` Yes , but I will manage him .
Parsing [sent. 2027 len. 10]: What a good thing old Mr. Bird is gone !
Parsing [sent. 2028 len. 6]: He was such a gossip !
Parsing [sent. 2029 len. 11]: We must call in the new doctor , Mr. Faber .
Parsing [sent. 2030 len. 7]: I shall see that he understands .
Parsing [sent. 2031 len. 15]: He has his practice to make , and will mind what I say . ''
Parsing [sent. 2032 len. 15]: `` Why , child , you are as cunning as an old witch ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2033 len. 4]: said her aunt .
Parsing [sent. 2034 len. 11]: `` It is very awkward , '' she went on .
Parsing [sent. 2035 len. 12]: `` What miserable creatures men are -- from first to last !
Parsing [sent. 2036 len. 12]: Out of one scrape into another from babies to old men !
Parsing [sent. 2037 len. 8]: Would you believe it , my dear ?
Parsing [sent. 2038 len. 34]: -- your uncle , one of the best of men , and most exemplary of clergymen -- why , I had to put on his stockings for him every day he got up !
Parsing [sent. 2039 len. 13]: Not that my services stopped there either , I can tell you !
Parsing [sent. 2040 len. 11]: Latterly I wrote more than half his sermons for him .
Parsing [sent. 2041 len. 12]: He never would preach the same sermon twice , you see .
Parsing [sent. 2042 len. 22]: He made that a point of honour ; and the consequence was that at last he had to come to me .
Parsing [sent. 2043 len. 15]: His sermons were nothing the losers , I trust , or our congregation either .
Parsing [sent. 2044 len. 20]: I used the same commentaries he did , and you would hardly believe how much I enjoyed the work .
Parsing [sent. 2045 len. 5]: -- Poor dear boy !
Parsing [sent. 2046 len. 10]: we must do what we can for him . ''
Parsing [sent. 2047 len. 13]: `` I will call you if I find it necessary , aunt .
Parsing [sent. 2048 len. 18]: I must go to him now , for he can not bear me out of his sight .
Parsing [sent. 2049 len. 14]: Do n't please send for the doctor till I see you again . ''
Parsing [sent. 2050 len. 17]: When she got back to her room , to her great relief she found Leopold asleep .
Parsing [sent. 2051 len. 45]: The comfort of the bed after his terrible exhaustion and the hardships he had undergone , had combined with the drug under whose influences he had more or less been ever since first he appeared at Helen 's window , and he slept soundly .
Parsing [sent. 2052 len. 18]: But when he woke , he was in a high fever , and Mr. Faber was summoned .
Parsing [sent. 2053 len. 19]: He found the state of his patient such that no amount of wild utterance could have surprised him .
Parsing [sent. 2054 len. 26]: His brain was burning and his mind all abroad : he tossed from side to side and talked vehemently -- but even to Helen unintelligibly .
Parsing [sent. 2055 len. 105]: Mr. Faber had not attended medical classes and walked the hospitals without undergoing the influences of the unbelief prevailing in those regions , where , on the strength of a little knowledge of the human frame , cartloads of puerile ignorance and anile vulgarity , not to mention obscenity , are uttered in the name of truth by men who know nothing whatever of the things that belong to the deeper nature believed in by the devout and simple , and professed also by many who are perhaps yet farther from a knowledge of its affairs than those who thus treat them with contempt .
Parsing [sent. 2056 len. 26]: When therefore he came to practise in Glaston , he brought his quota of yeast into the old bottle of that ancient and slumberous town .
Parsing [sent. 2057 len. 30]: But as he had to gain for himself a practice , he was prudent enough to make no display of the cherished emptiness of his swept and garnished rooms .
Parsing [sent. 2058 len. 8]: I do not mean to blame him .
Parsing [sent. 2059 len. 53]: He did not fancy himself the holder of any Mephistophelean commission for the general annihilation of belief like George Bascombe , only one from nature 's bureau of ways and means for the cure of the ailing body -- which , indeed , to him , comprised all there was of humanity .
Parsing [sent. 2060 len. 37]: He had a cold , hard , business-like manner , which , however admirable on some grounds , destroyed any hope Helen had cherished of finding in him one to whom she might disclose her situation .
Parsing [sent. 2061 len. 18]: He proved himself both wise and skilful , yet it was weeks before Leopold began to mend .
Parsing [sent. 2062 len. 42]: By the time the fever left him , he was in such a prostrate condition , that it was very doubtful whether yet he could live , and Helen had had to draw largely even upon her fine stock of health .
Parsing [sent. 2063 len. 6]: Her ministration continued most exhausting .
Parsing [sent. 2064 len. 23]: Yet now she thought of her life as she had never thought of it before , namely as a thing of worth .
Parsing [sent. 2065 len. 16]: It had grown precious to her since it had become the stay of Leopold 's .
Parsing [sent. 2066 len. 47]: Notwithstanding the terrible state of suspense and horror in which she now lived , seeming to herself at times an actual sharer in her brother 's guilt , she would yet occasionally find herself exulting in the thought of being the guardian angel he called her .
Parsing [sent. 2067 len. 33]: Now that by his bedside hour plodded after hour in something of sameness and much of weariness , she yet looked back on her past as on the history of a slug .
Parsing [sent. 2068 len. 24]: During all the time she scarcely saw her cousin George , and indeed , she could hardly tell why , shrunk from him .
Parsing [sent. 2069 len. 39]: In the cold , bright , shadowless , north-windy day of his presence , there was little consolation to be gathered , and for strength -- to face him made a fresh demand upon the little she had .
Parsing [sent. 2070 len. 7]: Her physical being had certainly lost .
Parsing [sent. 2071 len. 50]: But the countenance which , after a long interval of absence , the curate at length one morning descried in the midst of the congregation , had , along with its pallor and look of hidden and suppressed trouble , gathered the expression of a higher order of existence .
Parsing [sent. 2072 len. 52]: Not that she had drawn a single consoling draught from any one of the wells of religion , or now sought the church for the sake of any reminder of something found precious : the great quiet place drew her merely with the offer of its two hours ' restful stillness .
Parsing [sent. 2073 len. 37]: The thing which had elevated her was simply the fact that , without any thought , not to say knowledge of him , she had yet been doing the will of the Heart of the world .
Parsing [sent. 2074 len. 38]: True she had been but following her instinct , and ministering -- not to humanity from an enlarged affection , but only to the one being she best loved in the world -- a small merit surely !
Parsing [sent. 2075 len. 50]: -- yet was it the beginning of the way of God , the lovely way , and therefore the face of the maiden had begun to shine with a light which no splendour of physical health , no consciousness of beauty , however just , could have kindled there .
Parsing [sent. 2076 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXX .
Parsing [sent. 2077 len. 5]: THE CURATE 'S PROGRESS .
Parsing [sent. 2078 len. 56]: The visits of Wingfold to the little people at the gate not only became frequent , but more and more interesting to him , and as his office occasioned few demands on his attention , Polwarth had plenty of time to give to one who sought instruction in those things which were his very passion .
Parsing [sent. 2079 len. 45]: He had never yet had any pupil but his niece , and to find another , and one whose soul was so eager after that of which he had such long-gathered store to dispense , was a keen , pure , and solemn delight .
Parsing [sent. 2080 len. 26]: It was that for which he had so often prayed -- an outlet for the living waters of his spirit into dry and thirsty lands .
Parsing [sent. 2081 len. 49]: He had not much faculty for writing , although now and then he would relieve his heart in verse ; and if he had a somewhat remarkable gift of discourse , to attempt public utterance would have been but a vain exposure of his person to vulgar mockery .
Parsing [sent. 2082 len. 50]: In Wingfold he had found a man docile and obedient , both thirsting after , and recognizant of the truth , and if he might but aid him in unsealing the well of truth in his own soul , the healing waters might from him flow far and near .
Parsing [sent. 2083 len. 55]: Not as the little Zacchæus who pieced his own shortness with the length of the sycamore tree , so to rise above his taller brethren and see Jesus , little Polwarth would lift tall Wingfold on his shoulders , first to see , and then cry aloud to his brethren who was at hand .
Parsing [sent. 2084 len. 84]: For two or three Sundays , the curate , largely assisted by his friend , fed his flock with his gleanings from other men 's harvests , and already , though it had not yet come to his knowledge , one consequence was , that complaints , running together , made a pool of discontent , and a semi-public meeting had been held , wherein was discussed , and not finally negatived , the propriety of communicating with the rector on the subject .
Parsing [sent. 2085 len. 39]: Some however held that , as the incumbent paid so little attention to his flock , it would be better to appeal to the bishop , and acquaint him with the destitution of that portion of his oversight .
Parsing [sent. 2086 len. 28]: But things presently took a new turn , at first surprising , soon alarming to some , and at length , to not a few , appalling .
Parsing [sent. 2087 len. 14]: Obedient to Polwarth 's instructions , Wingfold had taken to his New Testament .
Parsing [sent. 2088 len. 58]: At first , as he read and sought to understand , ever and anon some small difficulty , notably , foremost of all , the discrepancy in the genealogies -- I mention it merely to show the sort of difficulty I mean -- would insect-like shoot out of the darkness , and sting him in the face .
Parsing [sent. 2089 len. 55]: Some of these he pursued , encountered , crushed -- and found he had gained next to nothing by the victory ; and Polwarth soon persuaded him to let such , alone for the present , seeing they involved nothing concerning the man at a knowledge of whom it was his business to arrive .
Parsing [sent. 2090 len. 22]: But when it came to the perplexity caused by some of the sayings of Jesus himself , it was another matter .
Parsing [sent. 2091 len. 15]: He MUST understand these , he thought , or fail to understand the man .
Parsing [sent. 2092 len. 73]: Here Polwarth told him that , if , after all , he seemed to fail , he must conclude that possibly the meaning of the words was beyond him , and that the understanding of them depended on a more advanced knowledge of Jesns himself ; for , while words reveal the speaker , they must yet lie in the light of something already known of the speaker to be themselves intelligible .
Parsing [sent. 2093 len. 24]: Between the mind and the understanding of certain hard utterances , therefore , there must of necessity lie a gradation of easier steps .
Parsing [sent. 2094 len. 47]: And here Polwarth was tempted to give him a far more important , because more immediately practical hint , but refrained , from the dread of weakening , by PRESENTATION , the force of a truth which , in DISCOVERY , would have its full effect .
Parsing [sent. 2095 len. 33]: For he was confident that the curate , in the temper which was now his , must ere long come immediately upon the truth towards which he was tempted to point him .
Parsing [sent. 2096 len. 47]: On one occasion when Wingfold had asked him whether he saw the meaning of a certain saying of our Lord , Polwarth answered thus : `` I think I do , but whether I could at present make you see it , I can not tell .
Parsing [sent. 2097 len. 27]: I suspect it is one of those concerning which I have already said that you have yet to understand Jesus better before you can understand them .
Parsing [sent. 2098 len. 50]: Let me , just to make the nature of what I state clearer to you , ask you one question : tell me , if you can , what , primarily , did Jesus , from his own account of himself , come into the world to do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2099 len. 9]: `` To save it , '' answered Wingfold .
Parsing [sent. 2100 len. 11]: `` I think you are wrong , '' returned Polwarth .
Parsing [sent. 2101 len. 6]: `` Mind I said PRIMARILY .
Parsing [sent. 2102 len. 12]: You will yourself come to the same conclusion by and by .
Parsing [sent. 2103 len. 66]: Either our Lord was a phantom -- a heresy of potent working in the minds of many who would be fierce in its repudiation -- or he was a very man , uttering the heart of his life that it might become the life of his brethren ; and if so , an honest man can never ultimately fail of getting at what he means .
Parsing [sent. 2104 len. 21]: I have seen him described somewhere as a man dominated by the passion of humanity -- or something like that .
Parsing [sent. 2105 len. 14]: The description does not , to my mind , even shadow the truth .
Parsing [sent. 2106 len. 37]: Another passion , if such I may dare to call it , was the light of his life , dominating even that which would yet have been enough to make him lay down his life . ''
Parsing [sent. 2107 len. 5]: Wingfold went away pondering .
Parsing [sent. 2108 len. 78]: Though Polwarth read little concerning religion except the New Testament , he could yet have directed Wingfold to several books which might have lent him good aid in his quest after the real likeness of the man he sought ; but he greatly desired that on the soul of his friend the dawn should break over the mountains of Judæa -- the light , I mean , flow from the words themselves of the Son of Man .
Parsing [sent. 2109 len. 54]: Sometimes he grew so excited about his pupil and his progress , and looked so anxiously for the news of light in his darkness , that he could not rest at home , but would be out all day in the park -- praying , his niece believed , for the young parson .
Parsing [sent. 2110 len. 138]: And little did Wingfold suspect that , now and again when his lamp was burning far into the night because he struggled with some hard saying , the little man was going round and round the house , like one muttering charms , only they were prayers for his friend : ill satisfied with his own feeble affection , he would supplement it with its origin , would lay hold upon the riches of the Godhead , crying for his friend to `` the first stock-father of gentleness ; '' -- folly all , and fair subject of laughter to such as George Bascombe , if there be no God ; but as Polwarth , with his whole , healthy , holy soul believed there is a God -- it was for him but simple common sense .
Parsing [sent. 2111 len. 12]: Still no daybreak -- and now the miracles had grown troublesome !
Parsing [sent. 2112 len. 38]: Could Mr. Polwarth honestly say that he found no difficulty in believing things so altogether out of the common order of events , and so buried in the darkness and dust of antiquity that investigation was impossible ?
Parsing [sent. 2113 len. 13]: Mr. Polwarth could not say that he had found no such difficulty .
Parsing [sent. 2114 len. 78]: `` Then why should the weight of the story , '' said Wingfold , `` the weight of its proof , I mean , to minds like ours , coming so long after , and by their education incapacitated for believing in such things , in a time when the law of everything is searched into -- '' `` And as yet very likely as far from understood as ever , '' interposed but not interrupted Polwarth .
Parsing [sent. 2115 len. 21]: `` Why should the weight of its proof , I ask , be laid upon such improbable things as miracles ?
Parsing [sent. 2116 len. 13]: That they are necessarily improbable , I presume you will admit . ''
Parsing [sent. 2117 len. 21]: `` Having premised that I believe every one recorded , '' said Polwarth , `` I heartily admit their improbability .
Parsing [sent. 2118 len. 15]: But the WEIGHT of proof is not , and never was laid upon them .
Parsing [sent. 2119 len. 26]: Our Lord did not make much of them , and did them far more for the individual concerned than for the sake of the beholders .
Parsing [sent. 2120 len. 11]: I will not however talk to you about them now .
Parsing [sent. 2121 len. 30]: I will merely say that it is not through the miracles you will find the Lord , though , having found him , you will find him there also .
Parsing [sent. 2122 len. 12]: The question for you is not , Are the miracles true ?
Parsing [sent. 2123 len. 6]: but , Was Jesus true ?
Parsing [sent. 2124 len. 13]: Again I say , you must find him -- the man himself .
Parsing [sent. 2125 len. 29]: When you have found him , I may perhaps retort upon you the question -- Can you believe such improbable things as the miracles , Mr. Wingfold ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2126 len. 40]: The little man showed pretty plainly by the set of his lips that he meant to say no more , and again Wingfold had , with considerable dissatisfaction and no answer , to go back to his New Testament .
Parsing [sent. 2127 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXXI .
Parsing [sent. 2128 len. 6]: THE CURATE MAKES A DISCOVERY .
Parsing [sent. 2129 len. 141]: At length , one day , as he was working with a harmony , comparing certain passages between themselves , and as variedly given in the gospels , he fell into a half-thinking , half-dreaming mood , in which his eyes , for some time unconsciously , rested on the verse , `` Ye will not come unto me that ye might have life : '' it mingled itself with his brooding , and by and by , though yet he was brooding rather than meditating , the form of Jesus had gathered , in the stillness of his mental quiescence , so much of reality that at length he found himself thinking of him as of a true-hearted man , mightily in earnest to help his fellows , who could not get them to mind what he told them .
Parsing [sent. 2130 len. 4]: `` Ah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2131 len. 21]: said the curate to himself , `` if I had but seen him , would not I have minded him !
Parsing [sent. 2132 len. 22]: -- would I not have haunted his steps , with question upon question , until I got at the truth ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2133 len. 53]: Again the more definite thought vanished in the seething chaos of reverie , which dured unbroken for a time , -- until again suddenly rose from memory to consciousness and attention the words : `` Why call ye me Lord , Lord , and do not the things which I say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2134 len. 5]: `` Good God ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2135 len. 43]: he exclaimed , `` here am I bothering over words , and questioning about this and that , as if I were testing his fitness for a post I had to offer him , and he all the time claiming my obedience !
Parsing [sent. 2136 len. 39]: I can not even , on the spur of the moment at least , tell one thing he wants me to do ; and as to doing anything because he told me -- not once did I ever !
Parsing [sent. 2137 len. 18]: But then how am I to obey him until I am sure of his right to command ?
Parsing [sent. 2138 len. 15]: I just want to know whether I am to call him Lord or not .
Parsing [sent. 2139 len. 23]: No , that wo n't do either , for he says , Why even of yourselves judge ye not what is right ?
Parsing [sent. 2140 len. 26]: And do I not know -- have I ever even doubted that what he said we ought to do was the right thing to do ?
Parsing [sent. 2141 len. 74]: Yet here have I , all these years , been calling myself a Christian , ministering , forsooth , in the temple of Christ , as if he were a heathen divinity , who cared for songs and prayers and sacrifices , and can not honestly say I ever once in my life did a thing because he said so , although the record is full of his earnest , even pleading words !
Parsing [sent. 2142 len. 29]: I have NOT been an honest man , and how should a dishonest man be a judge over that man who said he was the Christ of God ?
Parsing [sent. 2143 len. 27]: Would it be any wonder if the things he uttered should be too high and noble to be by such a man recognized as truth ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2144 len. 39]: With this , yet another saying dawned upon , him : IF ANY MAN WILL DO HIS WILL , HE SHALL KNOW OF THE DOCTRINE , WHETHER IT BE OF GOD , OR WHETHER I SPEAK OF MYSELF .
Parsing [sent. 2145 len. 26]: He went into his closet and shut to the door -- came out again , and went straight to visit a certain grievous old woman .
Parsing [sent. 2146 len. 40]: The next open result was , that , on the following Sunday , a man went up into the pulpit who , for the first time in his life , believed he had something to say to his fellow-sinners .
Parsing [sent. 2147 len. 43]: It was not now the sacred spoil of the best of gleaning or catering that he bore thither with him , but the message given him by a light in his own inward parts , discovering therein the darkness and the wrong .
Parsing [sent. 2148 len. 39]: He opened no sermon-case , nor read words from any book , save , with trembling voice , these : `` WHY CALL YE ME LORD , LORD , AND DO NOT THE THINGS WHICH I SAY ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2149 len. 33]: I pause for a moment in my narrative to request the sympathy of such readers as may be capable of affording it , for a man whose honesty makes him appear egotistic .
Parsing [sent. 2150 len. 91]: When a man , finding himself in a false position , is yet anxious to do the duties of that position until such time as , if he should not in the meantime have verified it , and become able to fill it with honesty , he may honourably leave it , I think he may well be pardoned if , of inward necessity , he should refer to himself in a place where such reference may be either the greatest impiety , or the outcome of the truest devotion .
Parsing [sent. 2151 len. 34]: In him it was neither : it was honesty -- and absorption in the startled gaze of a love that believed it had caught a glimmer of the passing garment of the Truth .
Parsing [sent. 2152 len. 9]: Thus strengthened -- might I not say inspired ?
Parsing [sent. 2153 len. 30]: for what is the love of truth and the joy therein , if not a breathing into the soul of the breath of life from the God of truth ?
Parsing [sent. 2154 len. 71]: -- he looked round upon his congregation as he had never dared until now -- saw face after face , and knew it -- saw amongst the rest that of Helen Lingard , so sadly yet not pitifully altered , with a doubt if it could be she ; trembled a little with a new excitement , which one less modest or less wise might have taken -- how foolishly !
Parsing [sent. 2155 len. 51]: -- instead of the truth perceived , for the inspiration of the spirit ; and , sternly suppressing the emotion , said , `` My hearers , I come before you this morning to utter the first word of truth it has ever been given to ME to utter . ''
Parsing [sent. 2156 len. 8]: His hearers stared both mentally and corporeally .
Parsing [sent. 2157 len. 10]: `` Is he going to deny the Bible ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2158 len. 3]: said some .
Parsing [sent. 2159 len. 31]: -- `` It will be the last , '' said others , `` if the rector hear in time how you have been disgracing yourself and profaning his pulpit . ''
Parsing [sent. 2160 len. 27]: `` And , '' the curate went on , `` it would be as a fire in my bones did I attempt to keep it back .
Parsing [sent. 2161 len. 47]: `` In my room , three days ago , I was reading the strange story of the man who appeared in Palestine saying that he was the Son of God , and came upon those words of his which I have now read in your hearing .
Parsing [sent. 2162 len. 27]: At their sound the accuser , Conscience , awoke in my bosom , and asked , ` Doest thou the things he saith to thee ? '
Parsing [sent. 2163 len. 19]: And I thought with myself , -- ` Have I this day done anything he says to me ?
Parsing [sent. 2164 len. 12]: -- when did I do anything I had heard of him ?
Parsing [sent. 2165 len. 34]: Did I ever ' -- to this it came at last -- ` Did I ever , in all my life , do one thing because he said to me DO THIS ? '
Parsing [sent. 2166 len. 8]: And the answer was NO , NEVER .
Parsing [sent. 2167 len. 57]: Yet there I was , not only calling myself a Christian , but on the strength of my Christianity , it was to be presumed , living amongst you , and received by you , as your helper on the way to the heavenly kingdom -- a living falsehood , walking and talking amongst you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2168 len. 6]: `` What a wretch ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2169 len. 35]: said one man to himself , who made a large part of his living by the sale of under-garments whose every stitch was an untacking of the body from the soul of a seamstress .
Parsing [sent. 2170 len. 4]: `` Bah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2171 len. 3]: said some .
Parsing [sent. 2172 len. 10]: `` A hypocrite , by his own confession ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2173 len. 3]: said others .
Parsing [sent. 2174 len. 5]: `` Exceedingly improper ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2175 len. 4]: said Mrs. Ramshorn .
Parsing [sent. 2176 len. 7]: `` Unheard-of and most unclerical behaviour !
Parsing [sent. 2177 len. 8]: And actually to confess such paganism ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2178 len. 35]: For Helen , she waked up a little , began to listen , and wondered what he had been saying that a wind seemed to have blown rustling among the heads of the congregation .
Parsing [sent. 2179 len. 41]: `` Having made this confession , '' Wingfold proceeded , `` you will understand that whatever I now say , I say to and of myself as much as to and of any other to whom it may apply . ''
Parsing [sent. 2180 len. 44]: He then proceeded to show that faith and obedience are one and the same spirit , passing as it were from room to room in the same heart : what in the heart we call faith , in the will we call obedience .
Parsing [sent. 2181 len. 50]: He showed that the Lord refused absolutely the faith that found its vent at the lips in the worshipping words , and not at the limbs in obedient action -- which some present pronounced bad theology , while others said to themselves surely that at least was common sense .
Parsing [sent. 2182 len. 51]: For Helen , what she heard might be interesting to clergymen , or people like her aunt who had to do with such matters , but to her it was less than nothing and vanity , whose brother lay at home `` sick in heart and sick in head . ''
Parsing [sent. 2183 len. 21]: But hard thoughts of him could not stay the fountain of Wingfold 's utterance , which filled as it flowed .
Parsing [sent. 2184 len. 56]: Eager after a right presentation of what truth he saw , he dwelt on the mockery it would be of any man to call him the wisest , the best , the kindest , yea and the dearest of men , yet never heed either the smallest request or the most urgent entreaty he made .
Parsing [sent. 2185 len. 5]: `` A Socinian ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2186 len. 4]: said Mrs. Ramshorn .
Parsing [sent. 2187 len. 9]: `` There 's stuff in the fellow ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2188 len. 14]: said the rector 's churchwarden , who had been brought up a Wesleyan .
Parsing [sent. 2189 len. 17]: `` He 'd make a fellow fancy he did believe all his grandmother told him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2190 len. 3]: thought Bascombe .
Parsing [sent. 2191 len. 12]: As he went on , the awakened curate grew almost eloquent .
Parsing [sent. 2192 len. 6]: His face shone with earnestness .
Parsing [sent. 2193 len. 21]: Even Helen found her gaze fixed upon him , though she had not a notion what he was talking about .
Parsing [sent. 2194 len. 50]: He closed at length with these words : `` After the confession I have now made to you , a confession which I have also entreated everyone to whom it belongs to make to himself and his God , it follows that I dare not call myself a Christian .
Parsing [sent. 2195 len. 32]: How should such a one as I know anything about that which , if it be true at all , is the loftiest , the one all-absorbing truth in the universe ?
Parsing [sent. 2196 len. 31]: How should such a fellow as I '' -- he went on , growing scornful at himself in the presence of the truth -- `` judge of its sacred probabilities ?
Parsing [sent. 2197 len. 31]: or , having led such a life of simony , be heard when he declares that such a pretended message from God to men seems too good to be true ?
Parsing [sent. 2198 len. 15]: The things therein contained I declare good , yet went not and did them .
Parsing [sent. 2199 len. 17]: Therefore am I altogether out of court , and must not be heard in the matter .
Parsing [sent. 2200 len. 101]: `` No , my hearers , I call not myself a Christian , but I call everyone here who obeys the word of Jesus , who restrains anger , who declines judgment , who practises generosity , who loves his enemies , who prays for his slanderers , to witness my vow , that I will henceforth try to obey him , in the hope that he whom he called God and his Father , will reveal to him whom you call your Lord Jesus Christ , that into my darkness I may receive the light of the world ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2201 len. 6]: `` A professed infidel ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2202 len. 4]: said Mrs. Ramshorn .
Parsing [sent. 2203 len. 6]: `` A clever one too !
Parsing [sent. 2204 len. 20]: That was a fine trap he laid for us , to prove us all atheists as well as himself !
Parsing [sent. 2205 len. 13]: As if any mere mortal COULD obey the instructions of the Saviour !
Parsing [sent. 2206 len. 10]: He was divine ; we are but human ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2207 len. 29]: She might have added , `` And but poor creatures as such , '' but did not go so far , believing herself more than an average specimen .
Parsing [sent. 2208 len. 42]: But there was one shining face which , like a rising sun of love and light and truth , `` pillowed his chin , '' not `` on an orient wave , '' but on the book-board of a free seat .
Parsing [sent. 2209 len. 42]: The eyes of it were full of tears , and the heart behind it was giving that God and Father thanks , for this was more , far more than he had even hoped for , save in the indefinite future .
Parsing [sent. 2210 len. 34]: The light was no longer present as warmth or vivification alone , but had begun to shine as light in the heart of his friend , to whom now , praised be God !
Parsing [sent. 2211 len. 8]: the way lay open into all truth .
Parsing [sent. 2212 len. 54]: And when the words came , in a voice that once more trembled with emotion -- `` Now to God the Father , '' -- he bent down his face , and the poor , stunted , distorted frame and great grey head were grievously shaken with the sobs of a mighty gladness .
Parsing [sent. 2213 len. 23]: Truth in the inward parts looked out upon him from the face of one who stood before the people their self-denied teacher !
Parsing [sent. 2214 len. 6]: How would they receive it ?
Parsing [sent. 2215 len. 4]: It mattered not .
Parsing [sent. 2216 len. 10]: Those whom the Father had drawn , would hear .
Parsing [sent. 2217 len. 23]: Polwarth neither sought the curate in the vestry , waited for him at the church-door , nor followed him to his lodging .
Parsing [sent. 2218 len. 14]: He was not of those who compliment a man on his fine sermon .
Parsing [sent. 2219 len. 18]: How grandly careless are some men of the risk of ruin their praises are to their friends !
Parsing [sent. 2220 len. 7]: `` Let God praise him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2221 len. 13]: said Polwarth ; `` I will only dare to love him . ''
Parsing [sent. 2222 len. 11]: He would not toy with his friend 's waking Psyche .
Parsing [sent. 2223 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXXII .
Parsing [sent. 2224 len. 2]: HOPES .
Parsing [sent. 2225 len. 17]: It was the first Sunday Helen had gone to church since her brother came to her .
Parsing [sent. 2226 len. 49]: On the previous Sunday he had passed some crisis and begun to improve , and by the end of the week was so quiet , that longing for a change of atmosphere , and believing he might be left with the housekeeper , she had gone to church .
Parsing [sent. 2227 len. 21]: On her return she heard he was no worse , although he had `` been a-frettin ' after her . ''
Parsing [sent. 2228 len. 12]: She hurried to him as if he had been her baby .
Parsing [sent. 2229 len. 10]: `` What do you go to church for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2230 len. 20]: he asked , half-petulantly , like a spoilt child , with languid eyes whence the hard fire had vanished .
Parsing [sent. 2231 len. 9]: `` What 's the use of it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2232 len. 9]: He looked at her , waiting an answer .
Parsing [sent. 2233 len. 8]: `` Not much , '' replied Helen .
Parsing [sent. 2234 len. 9]: `` I like the quiet and the music .
Parsing [sent. 2235 len. 5]: That 's all . ''
Parsing [sent. 2236 len. 12]: He seemed disappointed , and lay still for a few moments .
Parsing [sent. 2237 len. 42]: `` In old times , '' he said at last , `` the churches used to be a refuge : I suppose that is why one ca n't help feeling as if some safety were to be got from them yet .
Parsing [sent. 2238 len. 10]: -- Was your cousin George there this morning ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2239 len. 12]: `` Yes , he went with us , '' answered Helen .
Parsing [sent. 2240 len. 8]: `` I should like to see him .
Parsing [sent. 2241 len. 8]: I want somebody to talk to . ''
Parsing [sent. 2242 len. 4]: Helen was silent .
Parsing [sent. 2243 len. 33]: She was more occupied however in answering to herself the question why she shrank so decidedly from bringing Bascombe into the sick-room , than in thinking what she should say to Leopold .
Parsing [sent. 2244 len. 93]: The truth was the truth , and why should she object to Leopold 's knowing , or at least being told as well as herself , that he need fear no punishment in the next world , whatever he might have to encounter in this ; that there was no frightful God who hated wrong-doing to be terrified at ; that even the badness of his own action need not distress him , for he and it would pass away as the blood he had shed had already vanished from the earth ?
Parsing [sent. 2245 len. 9]: Ought it not to encourage the poor fellow ?
Parsing [sent. 2246 len. 5]: -- But to what ?
Parsing [sent. 2247 len. 20]: To live on and endure his misery , or to put an end to it and himself at once ?
Parsing [sent. 2248 len. 21]: Or perhaps to plunge into vice that he might escape the consciousness of guilt and the dread of the law ?
Parsing [sent. 2249 len. 49]: I will not say that exactly such a train of thought as this passed through her mind , but of whatever sort it was , it brought her no nearer to a desire for the light of George Bascombe 's presence by the bedside of her guilty brother .
Parsing [sent. 2250 len. 34]: At the same time her partiality for her cousin made her justify his exclusion thus : `` George is so good himself , he is only fit for the company of good people .
Parsing [sent. 2251 len. 20]: He would not in the least understand my poor Poldie , and would be too hard upon him . ''
Parsing [sent. 2252 len. 43]: Since her brother 's appearance , in fact , she had seen very little of her cousin , and this not merely because her presence was so much required in the sick-chamber , but because she was herself unwilling to meet him .
Parsing [sent. 2253 len. 36]: She had felt , almost without knowing it , that his character was unsympathetic , and that his loud , cold good-nature could never recognise or justify such love as she bore to her brother !
Parsing [sent. 2254 len. 52]: Nor was this all ; for , remembering how he had upon one occasion expressed himself with regard to criminals , she feared even to look in his face , lest his keen , questioning , unsparing eye should read in her soul that she was the sister of a murderer .
Parsing [sent. 2255 len. 37]: Before this time however a hint of light had appeared in the clouds that enwrapped her and Leopold : she had begun to doubt whether he had really committed the crime of which he accused himself .
Parsing [sent. 2256 len. 34]: There had been no inquiry after him , except from his uncle , concerning his absence from Cambridge , for which his sudden attack of brain fever served as more than sufficient excuse .
Parsing [sent. 2257 len. 61]: That there had been such a murder , the newspapers left her no room to question -- but might not the relation in which he stood to the victim -- the horror of her death , the insidious approaches of the fever , and the influences of that hateful drug , have combined to call up an hallucination of blood-guiltiness ?
Parsing [sent. 2258 len. 84]: And what at length all but satisfied her of the truth of her conjecture was that , when he began to recover , Leopold seemed himself in doubt at times whether his sense of guilt had not its origin in some one or other of the many dreams which had haunted him throughout his illness , knowing only too well that it was long since dreams had become to him more real than the greater part of what was going on around him .
Parsing [sent. 2259 len. 48]: To this blurring and confusing of consciousness it probably contributed , that , in the first stages of the fever , he was under the influence of the same drug which had been working upon his brain up to the very moment when he committed the crime .
Parsing [sent. 2260 len. 112]: During the week the hope had almost settled into conviction ; and one consequence was that , although she was not a whit more inclined to introduce George Bascombe to the sick-chamber , she found herself not only equal , but no longer averse to meeting him ; and on the following Saturday , when he presented himself as usual , come to spend the Sunday , she listened to her aunt , and consented to go out with him for a ride -- in the evening , however , when Mrs. Rainshorn herself , who had shown Leopold great and genuine kindness , would be able to sit with him .
Parsing [sent. 2261 len. 32]: They therefore had dinner early , and Helen went again to her brother 's room , unwilling to leave him a moment until she gave up her charge to her aunt .
Parsing [sent. 2262 len. 11]: They had tea together , and Leopold was very quiet .
Parsing [sent. 2263 len. 27]: It is wonderful with what success the mind will accommodate itself , in its effort after peace , to the presence of the most torturing thought .
Parsing [sent. 2264 len. 27]: But Helen took this quietness for a sign of innocence , not knowing that the state of the feelings is neither test nor gauge of guilt .
Parsing [sent. 2265 len. 36]: The nearer perfection a character is , the louder is the cry of conscience at the appearance of fault ; and , on the other hand , the worst criminals have had the easiest minds .
Parsing [sent. 2266 len. 39]: Helen also was quiet , and fell into a dreamy mood , watching her brother , who every now and then turned on her a look of love and gratitude which moved her heart to its very depths .
Parsing [sent. 2267 len. 22]: Not until she heard the horses coming round from the stable , did she rise to go and change her dress .
Parsing [sent. 2268 len. 16]: `` I shall not be long away from you , Poldie , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 2269 len. 12]: `` Do not forget me , Helen , '' he returned .
Parsing [sent. 2270 len. 14]: `` If you forget me , an enemy will think of me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2271 len. 46]: His love comforted her , and yet further strengthened her faith in his innocence ; and it was with a kind of half-repose , timid , wavering , and glad , upon her countenance -- how different from the old , dull , wooden quiescence !
Parsing [sent. 2272 len. 10]: -- that she joined her cousin in the hall .
Parsing [sent. 2273 len. 19]: A moment , and he had lifted her to the saddle , and was mounted by her side .
Parsing [sent. 2274 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXXIII .
Parsing [sent. 2275 len. 3]: THE RIDE .
Parsing [sent. 2276 len. 36]: A soft west wind , issuing as from the heart of a golden vase filled with roses , met them the instant they turned out of the street , walking their horses towards the park-gate .
Parsing [sent. 2277 len. 16]: Something -- was it in the evening , or was it in his own soul ?
Parsing [sent. 2278 len. 30]: -- had prevailed to the momentary silencing of George Bascombe : -- it may have been but the influence of the cigar which Helen had begged him to finish .
Parsing [sent. 2279 len. 36]: Helen too was silent : she felt as if the low red sun , straight into which they seemed to be riding , blotted out her being in the level torrent of his usurping radiance .
Parsing [sent. 2280 len. 17]: Neither of them spoke a word until they had passed through the gate into the park .
Parsing [sent. 2281 len. 14]: It was a perfect English summer evening -- warm , but not sultry .
Parsing [sent. 2282 len. 64]: As they walked their horses up the carriage way , the sun went down , and as if he had fallen like a live coal into some celestial magazine of colour and glow , straightway blazed up a slow explosion of crimson and green in a golden triumph -- pure fire , the smoke and fuel gone , and the radiance alone left .
Parsing [sent. 2283 len. 51]: And now Helen received the second lesson of her initiation into the life of nature : she became aware that the whole evening was thinking around her , and as the dusk grew deeper and the night grew closer , the world seemed to have grown dark with its thinking .
Parsing [sent. 2284 len. 33]: Of late Helen had been driven herself to think -- if not deeply , yet intensely -- and so knew what it was like , and felt at home with the twilight .
Parsing [sent. 2285 len. 10]: They turned from the drive on to the turf .
Parsing [sent. 2286 len. 24]: Their horses tossed up their heads , and set off , unchecked , at a good pelting gallop , across the open park .
Parsing [sent. 2287 len. 14]: On Helen 's cheek the wind blew cooling , strong , and kind .
Parsing [sent. 2288 len. 74]: As if flowing from some fountain above , in an unseen unbanked river , down through the stiller ocean of the air , it seemed to bring to her a vague promise , almost a precognition , of peace -- which , however , only set her longing after something -- she knew not what -- something of which she only knew that it would fill the longing the wind had brought her .
Parsing [sent. 2289 len. 17]: The longing grew and extended -- went stretching on and on into an infinite of rest .
Parsing [sent. 2290 len. 79]: And as they still galloped , and the light-maddened colours sank into smoky peach , and yellow green , and blue gray , the something swelled and swelled in her soul , and pulled and pulled at her heart , until the tears were running down her face : for fear Bascombe should see them , she gave her horse the rein , and fled from him into the friendly dusk that seemed to grade time into eternity .
Parsing [sent. 2291 len. 17]: Suddenly she found herself close to a clump of trees , which overhung the deserted house .
Parsing [sent. 2292 len. 10]: She had made a great circuit without knowing it .
Parsing [sent. 2293 len. 14]: A pang shot to her heart , and her tears ceased to flow .
Parsing [sent. 2294 len. 14]: The night , silent with thought , held THAT also in its bosom !
Parsing [sent. 2295 len. 11]: She drew rein , turned , and waited for Bascombe .
Parsing [sent. 2296 len. 12]: `` What a chase you 've given me , Helen ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2297 len. 13]: he cried , while yet pounding away some score of yards off .
Parsing [sent. 2298 len. 10]: `` A wild-goose one you mean , cousin ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2299 len. 18]: `` It would have been if I had thought to catch you on this ancient cocktail . ''
Parsing [sent. 2300 len. 16]: `` Do n't abuse the old horse , George : he has seen better days .
Parsing [sent. 2301 len. 34]: I would gladly have mounted you more to your mind , but you know I could not -- except indeed I had given you my Fanny , and taken the old horse myself .
Parsing [sent. 2302 len. 6]: I have ridden him . ''
Parsing [sent. 2303 len. 16]: `` The lady ought always to be the better mounted , '' returned George coolly .
Parsing [sent. 2304 len. 36]: `` For my part , I much prefer it , because then I need not be anxious about whether I am boring her or not : if I am , she can run away . ''
Parsing [sent. 2305 len. 12]: `` You can not suppose I thought you a bore to-night .
Parsing [sent. 2306 len. 12]: A more sweetly silent gentleman none could wish for squire . ''
Parsing [sent. 2307 len. 9]: `` Then it was my silence bored you .
Parsing [sent. 2308 len. 12]: -- Shall I tell you what I was thinking about ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2309 len. 5]: `` If you like .
Parsing [sent. 2310 len. 20]: I was thinking how pleasant it would be to ride on and on into eternity , '' said Helen .
Parsing [sent. 2311 len. 20]: `` That feeling of continuity , '' returned George , `` is a proof of the painlessness of departure .
Parsing [sent. 2312 len. 38]: No one can ever know when he ceases to be , because then he is not ; and that is how some men come to fancy they feel as if they were going to live for ever .
Parsing [sent. 2313 len. 34]: But the worst of it is that they no sooner fancy it , than it seems to them a probable as well as delightful thing to go on and on and never cease .
Parsing [sent. 2314 len. 26]: This comes of the man 's having no consciousness of ceasing , and when one is comfortable , it always seems good to go on .
Parsing [sent. 2315 len. 18]: A child is never willing to turn from the dish of which he is eating to another .
Parsing [sent. 2316 len. 10]: It is more he wants , not another . ''
Parsing [sent. 2317 len. 12]: `` That is if he likes it , '' said Helen .
Parsing [sent. 2318 len. 16]: `` Everybody likes it , '' said George , '' -- more or less . ''
Parsing [sent. 2319 len. 13]: `` I am not so sure of EVERYbody , '' replied Helen .
Parsing [sent. 2320 len. 21]: `` Do you imagine that twisted little dwarf-woman that opened the gate for us is content with her lot ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2321 len. 17]: `` No , that is impossible -- while she sees you and remains what she is .
Parsing [sent. 2322 len. 7]: But I said nothing of contentment .
Parsing [sent. 2323 len. 55]: I was but thinking of the fools who , whether content or not , yet want to live for ever , and so , very conveniently , take their longing for immortality , which they call an idea innate in the human heart , for a proof that immortality is their rightful inheritance . ''
Parsing [sent. 2324 len. 16]: `` How then do you account for the existence and universality of the idea ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2325 len. 17]: asked Helen , who had happened lately to come upon some arguments on the other side .
Parsing [sent. 2326 len. 50]: But while she spoke thus indifferently she felt in her heart like one who wakes from a delicious swim in the fairest of rivers , to find that the clothes have slipped from the bed to the floor : -- that was all his river and all his swim !
Parsing [sent. 2327 len. 20]: `` I account for its existence as I have just said ; and for its universality by denying it .
Parsing [sent. 2328 len. 14]: It is NOT universal , for _ I _ have n't it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2329 len. 19]: `` At least you will not deny that men , even when miserable , shrink from dying ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2330 len. 12]: `` Anything , everything is unpleasant out of its due time .
Parsing [sent. 2331 len. 19]: I will allow , for the sake of argument , that the thought of dying is always unpleasant .
Parsing [sent. 2332 len. 4]: But wherefore so ?
Parsing [sent. 2333 len. 61]: Because , in the very act of thinking it , the idea must always be taken from the time that suits with it -- namely , its own time , when it will at length , and ought at length to come -- and placed in the midst of the lively present , with which assuredly it does not suit .
Parsing [sent. 2334 len. 9]: To life , death must be always hateful .
Parsing [sent. 2335 len. 29]: In the rush and turmoil of effort , how distasteful even the cave of the hermit -- let ever such a splendid view spread abroad before its mouth !
Parsing [sent. 2336 len. 31]: But when it comes it will be pleasant enough , for then its time will have come also -- the man will be prepared for it by decay and cessation .
Parsing [sent. 2337 len. 89]: If one were to tell me that he had that endless longing for immortality , of which hitherto I have only heard at second hand , I would explain it to him thus : -- Your life , I would say , not being yet complete , still growing , feels in itself the onward impulse of growth , and , unable to think of itself as other than complete , interprets that onward impulse as belonging to the time around it instead of the nature within it .
Parsing [sent. 2338 len. 68]: Or rather let me say , the man feels in himself the elements of more , and not being able to grasp the notion of his own completeness , which is so far from him , transposes the feeling of growth and sets it beyond himself , translating it at the same time into an instinct of duration , a longing after what he calls eternal life .
Parsing [sent. 2339 len. 37]: But when the man is complete , then comes decay and brings its own contentment with it -- as will also death , when it arrives in its own proper season of fulness and ripeness . ''
Parsing [sent. 2340 len. 6]: Helen said nothing in reply .
Parsing [sent. 2341 len. 38]: She thought her cousin very clever , but could not enjoy what he said -- not in the face of that sky , and in the yet lingering reflection of the feelings it had waked in her .
Parsing [sent. 2342 len. 16]: He might be right , but now at least she wanted no more of it .
Parsing [sent. 2343 len. 36]: She even felt as if she would rather cherish a sweet deception for the comfort of the moment in which the weaver 's shuttle flew , than take to her bosom a cold killing fact .
Parsing [sent. 2344 len. 9]: Such were indeed an unworthy feeling to follow !
Parsing [sent. 2345 len. 13]: Of all things let us have the truth -- even of fact !
Parsing [sent. 2346 len. 20]: But to deny what we can not prove , not even casts into our ice-house a spadeful of snow .
Parsing [sent. 2347 len. 13]: What if the warm hope denied should be the truth after all ?
Parsing [sent. 2348 len. 42]: What if it was the truth in it that drew the soul towards it by its indwelling reality , and its relations with her being , even while she took blame for suffering herself to be enticed by a sweet deception ?
Parsing [sent. 2349 len. 20]: Alas indeed for men if the life and the truth are not one , but fight against each other !
Parsing [sent. 2350 len. 43]: Surely it says something for the divine nature of him that denies the divine , when he yet cleaves to what he thinks the truth , although it denies the life , and blots the way to the better from every chart !
Parsing [sent. 2351 len. 11]: `` And what were you thinking of , George ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2352 len. 9]: said Helen , willing to change the subject .
Parsing [sent. 2353 len. 14]: `` I was thinking , '' he answered , `` let me see !
Parsing [sent. 2354 len. 3]: -- oh !
Parsing [sent. 2355 len. 13]: yes -- I was thinking of that very singular case of murder .
Parsing [sent. 2356 len. 9]: You must have seen it in the newspapers .
Parsing [sent. 2357 len. 18]: I have long had a doubt whether I were better fitted for a barrister or a detective .
Parsing [sent. 2358 len. 11]: I ca n't keep my mind off a puzzling case .
Parsing [sent. 2359 len. 30]: -- You must have heard of this one -- the girl they found lying in her ball-dress in the middle of a wood -- stabbed to the heart ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2360 len. 33]: `` I do remember something of it , '' answered Helen , gathering a little courage to put into her voice from the fact that her cousin could hardly see her face .
Parsing [sent. 2361 len. 10]: `` Then the murderer has not been discovered ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2362 len. 8]: `` That is the point of interest .
Parsing [sent. 2363 len. 6]: Not a trace of him !
Parsing [sent. 2364 len. 7]: Not a soul suspected even ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2365 len. 6]: Helen drew a deep breath .
Parsing [sent. 2366 len. 14]: `` Had it been in Rome , now , '' George went on .
Parsing [sent. 2367 len. 10]: `` But in a quiet country place in England !
Parsing [sent. 2368 len. 5]: The thing seems incredible !
Parsing [sent. 2369 len. 4]: So artistically done !
Parsing [sent. 2370 len. 4]: -- no struggle !
Parsing [sent. 2371 len. 18]: -- just one blow right to the heart , and the assassin gone as if by magic !
Parsing [sent. 2372 len. 5]: -- no weapon dropped !
Parsing [sent. 2373 len. 7]: -- nothing to give a clue !
Parsing [sent. 2374 len. 8]: The whole thing suggests a practised hand .
Parsing [sent. 2375 len. 10]: -- But why such a one for the victim ?
Parsing [sent. 2376 len. 18]: Had it been some false member of a secret society thus immolated , one could understand it .
Parsing [sent. 2377 len. 8]: But a merry girl at a ball !
Parsing [sent. 2378 len. 5]: -- it IS strange !
Parsing [sent. 2379 len. 11]: I SHOULD like to try the unravelling of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2380 len. 8]: `` Has nothing then been done ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2381 len. 21]: said Helen with a gasp , to hide which she moved in her saddle , as if readjusting her habit .
Parsing [sent. 2382 len. 8]: `` Oh , everything -- of course .
Parsing [sent. 2383 len. 39]: There was instant pursuit on the discovery of the body , but they seem to have got on the track of the wrong man -- or , indeed , for anything certain , of no man at all .
Parsing [sent. 2384 len. 76]: A coast-guardsman says that , on the night or rather morning in question , he was approaching a little cove on the shore , not above a mile from the scene of the tragedy , with an eye upon what seemed to be two fishermen preparing to launch their boat , when he saw a third man come running down the steep slope from the pastures above , and jump into the stern of it .
Parsing [sent. 2385 len. 17]: Ere he could reach the spot , they were off , and had hoisted two lugsails .
Parsing [sent. 2386 len. 20]: The moon was in the first of her last quarter , and gave light enough for what he reported .
Parsing [sent. 2387 len. 21]: But , when inquiries founded on this evidence were made , nothing whatever could be discovered concerning boat or men .
Parsing [sent. 2388 len. 20]: The next morning no fishing-boat was lacking , and no fisherman would confess to having gone from that cove .
Parsing [sent. 2389 len. 33]: The marks of the boat 's keel , and of the men 's feet , on the sand , if ever there were any , had been washed out by the tide .
Parsing [sent. 2390 len. 24]: It was concluded that the thing had been pre-arranged and provided for , and that the murderer had escaped , probably to Holland .
Parsing [sent. 2391 len. 23]: Thereupon telegrams were shot in all directions , but no news could be gathered of any suspicious landing on the opposite coast .
Parsing [sent. 2392 len. 14]: There the matter rests , or at least has rested for many weeks .
Parsing [sent. 2393 len. 16]: Neither parents , relatives , nor friends appear to have a suspicion of anyone . ''
Parsing [sent. 2394 len. 10]: `` Are there no conjectures as to motives ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2395 len. 13]: asked Helen , feeling with joy her power of dissimulation gather strength .
Parsing [sent. 2396 len. 6]: `` No end of them .
Parsing [sent. 2397 len. 29]: She was a beautiful creature , they say , sweet-tempered as a dove , and of course fond of admiration -- whence the conjectures all turn on jealousy .
Parsing [sent. 2398 len. 24]: The most likely thing seems , that she had some squire of low degree , of whom neither parents nor friends knew anything .
Parsing [sent. 2399 len. 22]: That they themselves suspect this , appears likely from their more than apathy with regard to the discovery of the villain .
Parsing [sent. 2400 len. 13]: I am strongly inclined to take the matter in hand myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 2401 len. 18]: `` We must get him out of the country as soon as possible , '' thought Helen .
Parsing [sent. 2402 len. 23]: `` I should hardly have thought it worthy of your gifts , George , '' she said , `` to turn police-man .
Parsing [sent. 2403 len. 15]: For my part , I should not relish hunting down any poor wretch . ''
Parsing [sent. 2404 len. 21]: `` The sacrifice of individual choice is a claim society has upon each of its members , '' returned Bascombe .
Parsing [sent. 2405 len. 20]: `` Every murderer hanged , or better , imprisoned for life , is a gain to the community . ''
Parsing [sent. 2406 len. 24]: Helen said no more , and presently turned homewards , on the plea that she must not be longer absent from her invalid .
Parsing [sent. 2407 len. 6]: END OF THE FIRST VOLUME .
Parsing [sent. 2408 len. 3]: VOL II .
Parsing [sent. 2409 len. 5]: THOMAS WINGFOLD , CURATE .
Parsing [sent. 2410 len. 7]: CHAPTER I. RACHEL AND HER UNCLE .
Parsing [sent. 2411 len. 12]: It was nearly dark when they arrived again at the lodge .
Parsing [sent. 2412 len. 7]: Rachel opened the gate for them .
Parsing [sent. 2413 len. 10]: Without even a THANK YOU , they rode out .
Parsing [sent. 2414 len. 38]: She stood for a moment gazing after them through the dusk , then turned with a sigh , and went into the kitchen , where her uncle sat by the fire with a book in his hand .
Parsing [sent. 2415 len. 15]: `` How I should like to be as well made as Miss Lingard ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2416 len. 14]: she said , seating herself by the lamp that stood on the deal-table .
Parsing [sent. 2417 len. 44]: `` It MUST be a fine thing to be strong and tall , and able to look this way and that without turning all your body along with your head , like the old man that gathers the leeches in Wordsworth 's poem .
Parsing [sent. 2418 len. 14]: And what it must be to sit on a horse as she does !
Parsing [sent. 2419 len. 15]: You should have seen her go flying like the very wind across the park !
Parsing [sent. 2420 len. 16]: You would have thought she and her horse were cut out of the same piece .
Parsing [sent. 2421 len. 8]: I 'm dreadfully envious , uncle . ''
Parsing [sent. 2422 len. 15]: `` No , my child ; I know you better than you do yourself .
Parsing [sent. 2423 len. 33]: There is a great difference between _ I _ WISH _ I _ WAS and _ I _ SHOULD LIKE TO BE -- as much as between a grumble and a prayer .
Parsing [sent. 2424 len. 9]: To be content is not to be satisfied .
Parsing [sent. 2425 len. 10]: No one ought to be satisfied with the imperfect .
Parsing [sent. 2426 len. 25]: It is God 's will that we should bear , and contentedly -- because in hope , looking for the redemption of the body .
Parsing [sent. 2427 len. 17]: And we know he has a ready servant who will one day set us free . ''
Parsing [sent. 2428 len. 8]: `` Yes , uncle ; I understand .
Parsing [sent. 2429 len. 16]: You know I enjoy life : how could I help it and you with me ?
Parsing [sent. 2430 len. 18]: But I do n't think I ever go through the churchyard without feeling a sort of triumph .
Parsing [sent. 2431 len. 7]: ` There 's for you ! '
Parsing [sent. 2432 len. 18]: I say sometimes to the little crooked shadow that creeps along by my side across the graves .
Parsing [sent. 2433 len. 11]: ` You 'll soon be caught and put inside ! '
Parsing [sent. 2434 len. 21]: -- But how am I to tell I may n't be crooked in the next world as well as this ?
Parsing [sent. 2435 len. 8]: That 's what troubles me at times .
Parsing [sent. 2436 len. 12]: There might be some necessity for it , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 2437 len. 19]: `` Then will there be patience to bear it there also ; that you may be sure of .
Parsing [sent. 2438 len. 6]: But I do not fear .
Parsing [sent. 2439 len. 30]: It were more likely that those who have not thanked God , but prided themselves that they were beautiful in this world , should be crooked in the next .
Parsing [sent. 2440 len. 11]: It would be like Dives and Lazarus , you know .
Parsing [sent. 2441 len. 14]: But God does what is best for them as well as for us .
Parsing [sent. 2442 len. 32]: We shall find one day that beauty and riches were the best thing for those to whom they were given , as deformity and poverty were the best for us . ''
Parsing [sent. 2443 len. 20]: `` I wonder what sort of person I should have been if I had had a straight spine ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2444 len. 4]: said Rachel laughing .
Parsing [sent. 2445 len. 17]: `` Hardly one so dear to your deformed uncle , '' said her companion in ugliness .
Parsing [sent. 2446 len. 15]: `` Then I 'm glad I am as I am , '' rejoined Rachel .
Parsing [sent. 2447 len. 37]: `` This conscious individuality of ours , '' said Polwarth , after a thoughtful silence , `` is to me an awful thing -- the one thing that seems in humanity like the onliness of God .
Parsing [sent. 2448 len. 33]: Mine terrifies me sometimes -- looking a stranger to me -- a limiting of myself -- a breaking in upon my existence -- like a volcanic outburst into the blue Sicilian air .
Parsing [sent. 2449 len. 24]: When it thus manifests itself , I find no refuge but the offering of it back to him who thought it worth making .
Parsing [sent. 2450 len. 22]: I say to him : ` Lord , it is thine , not mine ; -- see to it , Lord .
Parsing [sent. 2451 len. 14]: Thou and thy eternity are mine , Father of Jesus Christ . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 2452 len. 17]: He covered his eyes with his hands , and his lips grew white , and trembled .
Parsing [sent. 2453 len. 14]: Thought had turned into prayer , and both were silent for a space .
Parsing [sent. 2454 len. 7]: Rachel was the first to speak .
Parsing [sent. 2455 len. 12]: `` I think I understand , uncle , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 2456 len. 10]: `` I do n't mind being God 's dwarf .
Parsing [sent. 2457 len. 17]: But I would rather be made after his own image ; this ca n't be it .
Parsing [sent. 2458 len. 10]: I should like to be made over again . ''
Parsing [sent. 2459 len. 33]: `` And if the hope we are saved by be no mockery , if St. Paul was not the fool of his own radiant imaginings , you will be , my child .
Parsing [sent. 2460 len. 10]: -- But now let us forget our miserable bodies .
Parsing [sent. 2461 len. 25]: Come up to my room , and I will read you a few lines that came to me this morning in the park . ''
Parsing [sent. 2462 len. 11]: `` Wo n't you wait for Mr. Wingfold , uncle ?
Parsing [sent. 2463 len. 9]: He will be here yet , I think .
Parsing [sent. 2464 len. 7]: It ca n't be ten o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 2465 len. 14]: He always looks in on Saturdays as he goes home from his walk .
Parsing [sent. 2466 len. 11]: I should like you to read them to him too .
Parsing [sent. 2467 len. 10]: They will do him good , I know . ''
Parsing [sent. 2468 len. 18]: `` I would , my dear , willingly , if I thought he would care for them .
Parsing [sent. 2469 len. 8]: But I do n't think he would .
Parsing [sent. 2470 len. 7]: They are not good enough verses .
Parsing [sent. 2471 len. 21]: He has been brought up on Horace , and , I fear , counts the best poetry the neatest . ''
Parsing [sent. 2472 len. 21]: `` I think you must be mistaken there , uncle ; I have heard him talk delightfully about poetry . ''
Parsing [sent. 2473 len. 21]: `` You must excuse me if I am shy of reading my poor work to any but yourself , Rachel .
Parsing [sent. 2474 len. 46]: My heart was wo much in it , and the subject is so sacred -- '' `` I am sorry you should think your pearls too good to cast before Mr. Wingfold , uncle , '' said Rachel , with a touch of disappointed temper .
Parsing [sent. 2475 len. 21]: `` Nay , nay , child , '' returned Polwarth , `` that was not a good thing to say .
Parsing [sent. 2476 len. 34]: What gives me concern is , that there is so much of the rough dirty shell sticking about them , that to show them would be to wrong the truth in them . ''
Parsing [sent. 2477 len. 7]: Rachel seldom took long to repent .
Parsing [sent. 2478 len. 30]: She came slowly to her uncle , where he stood with the lamp in his hand , looking in his face with a heavenly contrition , and saying nothing .
Parsing [sent. 2479 len. 21]: When she reached him , she dropped on her knees , and kissed the hand that hung by his side .
Parsing [sent. 2480 len. 10]: Her temper was poor Rachel 's one sore-felt trouble .
Parsing [sent. 2481 len. 27]: Polwarth stooped and kissed her on the forehead , raised her , and leading her to the stair , stood aside to let her go first .
Parsing [sent. 2482 len. 19]: But when she had been naughty Rachel would never go before her uncle , and she drew back .
Parsing [sent. 2483 len. 12]: With a smile of intelligence he yielded and led the way .
Parsing [sent. 2484 len. 24]: But ere they had climbed to the top , Rachel heard Mr. Wingfold 's step , and went down again to receive him .
Parsing [sent. 2485 len. 3]: CHAPTER II .
Parsing [sent. 2486 len. 3]: A DREAM .
Parsing [sent. 2487 len. 46]: Invited to ascend , Wingfold followed Rachel to her uncle 's room , and there , whether guided by her or not , the conversation presently took such a turn that at length , of his own motion , Polwarth offered to read his verses .
Parsing [sent. 2488 len. 103]: From the drawer of his table he took a scratched and scored halfsheet , and -- not in the most melodious of voices , yet in one whose harshness and weakness could not cover a certain refinement of spiritual tenderness -- read as follows : Lord , hear my discontent : All blank I stand , A mirror polished by thy hand ; Thy sun 's beams flash and flame from me -- I can not help it : here I stand , there he ; To one of them I can not say -- Go , and on yonder water play .
Parsing [sent. 2489 len. 21]: Nor one poor ragged daisy can I fashion -- I do not make the words of this my limping passion .
Parsing [sent. 2490 len. 14]: If I should say : Now I will think a thought , Lo !
Parsing [sent. 2491 len. 37]: I must wait , unknowing , What thought in me is growing , Until the thing to birth is brought ; Nor know I then what next will come From out the gulf of silence dumb .
Parsing [sent. 2492 len. 48]: I am the door the thing did find To pass into the general mind ; I can not say I think -- I only stand upon the thought-well 's brink ; From darkness to the sun the water bubbles up -- I lift it in my cup .
Parsing [sent. 2493 len. 15]: Thou only thinkest -- I am thought ; Me and my thought thou thinkest .
Parsing [sent. 2494 len. 15]: Nought Am I but as a fountain spout From which thy water welleth out .
Parsing [sent. 2495 len. 11]: Thou art the only One , the All in all .
Parsing [sent. 2496 len. 26]: -- Yet when my soul on thee doth call And thou dost answer out of everywhere , I in thy allness have my perfect share .
Parsing [sent. 2497 len. 19]: While he read Rachel crept to his knee , knelt down , and laid her head upon it .
Parsing [sent. 2498 len. 47]: If we are but the creatures of a day , yet surely were the shadow-joys of this miserable pair not merely nobler in their essence , but finer to the soul 's palate than the shadow-joys of young Hercules Bascombe -- Helen and horses and all !
Parsing [sent. 2499 len. 30]: Poor Helen I can not use for comparison , for she had no joy , save indeed the very divine , though at present unblossoming one of sisterly love .
Parsing [sent. 2500 len. 40]: Still , and notwithstanding , if the facts of life are those of George Bascombe 's endorsing -- AND HE CAN PROVE IT -- let us by all means learn and accept them , be they the worst possible .
Parsing [sent. 2501 len. 47]: Meantime there are truths that ought to be facts , and until he has proved that there is no God , some of us will go feeling after him if haply we may find him , and in him the truths we long to find true .
Parsing [sent. 2502 len. 50]: Some of us perhaps think we have seen him from afar , but we only know the better that in the mood wherein such as Bascombe are , they will never find him -- which would no doubt be to them a comfort were it not for a laughter .
Parsing [sent. 2503 len. 20]: And if he be such as their idea of what we think him , they ARE better without him .
Parsing [sent. 2504 len. 29]: If , on the contrary , he be what some of us really think him , their not seeking him will not perhaps prevent him from finding them .
Parsing [sent. 2505 len. 106]: From likeness of nature , community of feeling , constant intercourse , and perfect confidence , Rachel understood her uncle 's verses with sufficient ease to enjoy them at once in part , and , for the rest , to go on thinking in the direction in which they would carry her ; but Wingfold , in whom honesty of disposition had blossomed at last into honesty of action , after fitting pause , during which no word was spoken , said : -- `` Mr. Polwarth , where verse is concerned , I am simply stupid : when read I can not follow it .
Parsing [sent. 2506 len. 10]: I did not understand the half of that poem .
Parsing [sent. 2507 len. 31]: I never have been a student of English verse , and indeed that part of my nature which has to do with poetry , has been a good deal neglected .
Parsing [sent. 2508 len. 12]: Will you let me take those verses home with me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2509 len. 23]: `` I can not do that , for they are not legible ; but I will copy them out for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2510 len. 8]: `` Will you give me them to-morrow ?
Parsing [sent. 2511 len. 7]: Shall you be at church ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2512 len. 19]: `` That shall be just as you please : would you rather have me there or not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2513 len. 11]: `` A thousand times rather , '' answered the curate .
Parsing [sent. 2514 len. 28]: `` To have one man there who knows what I mean better than I can say it , is to have a double soul and double courage .
Parsing [sent. 2515 len. 35]: -- But I came to-night mainly to tell you that I have been much puzzled this last week to know how I ought to regard the Bible -- I mean as to its inspiration .
Parsing [sent. 2516 len. 9]: What am I to say about it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2517 len. 7]: `` Those are two distinct things .
Parsing [sent. 2518 len. 14]: Why think of saying about it , before you have anything to say ?
Parsing [sent. 2519 len. 31]: For yourself , however , let me ask if you have not already found in the book the highest means of spiritual education and development you have yet met with ?
Parsing [sent. 2520 len. 11]: If so , may not that suffice for the present ?
Parsing [sent. 2521 len. 28]: It is the man Christ Jesus we have to know , and the Bible we have to use to that end -- not for theory or dogma .
Parsing [sent. 2522 len. 17]: -- I will tell you a strange dream I had once , not long ago . ''
Parsing [sent. 2523 len. 5]: Rachel 's face brightened .
Parsing [sent. 2524 len. 39]: She rose , got a little stool , and setting it down close by the chair on which her uncle was perched , seated herself at his feet , with her eyes on the ground , to listen .
Parsing [sent. 2525 len. 43]: `` About two years ago , '' said Polwarth , `` a friend sent me Tauchnitz 's edition of the English New Testament , which has the different readings of the three oldest known manuscripts translated at the foot of the page .
Parsing [sent. 2526 len. 52]: The edition was prepared chiefly for the sake of showing the results of the collation of the Sinaitic manuscript , the oldest of all , so named because it was found -- a few years ago , by Tischendorf -- in a monastery on Mount Sinai -- nowhere else than there !
Parsing [sent. 2527 len. 32]: I received it with such exultation as brought on an attack of asthma , and I could scarce open it for a week , but lay with it under my pillow .
Parsing [sent. 2528 len. 26]: When I did come to look at it , my main wonder was to find the differences from the common version so few and small .
Parsing [sent. 2529 len. 45]: Still there were some such as gave rise to a feeling far above mere interest -- one in particular , the absence of a word that had troubled me , not seeming like a word of our Lord , or consonant with his teaching .
Parsing [sent. 2530 len. 14]: I am unaware whether the passage has ever given rise to controversy . ''
Parsing [sent. 2531 len. 10]: `` May I ask what word it was ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2532 len. 5]: interrupted Wingfold , eagerly .
Parsing [sent. 2533 len. 10]: `` I will not say , '' returned Polwarth .
Parsing [sent. 2534 len. 18]: `` Not having troubled you , you would probably only wonder why it should have troubled me .
Parsing [sent. 2535 len. 37]: For my purpose in mentioning the matter , it is enough to say that I had turned with eagerness to the passage wherein it occurs , as given in two of the gospels in our version .
Parsing [sent. 2536 len. 39]: Judge my delight in discovering that in the one gospel the whole passage was omitted by the two oldest manuscripts , and in the other just the one word that had troubled me , by the same two .
Parsing [sent. 2537 len. 61]: I would not have you suppose me foolish enough to imagine that the oldest manuscript must be the most correct ; but you will at once understand the sense of room and air which the discovery gave me notwithstanding , and I mention it because it goes both to account for the dream that followed and to enforce its truth .
Parsing [sent. 2538 len. 20]: Pray do not however imagine me a believer in dreams more than in any other source of mental impressions .
Parsing [sent. 2539 len. 31]: If a dream reveal a principle , that principle is a revelation , and the dream is neither more NOR LESS valuable than a waking thought that does the same .
Parsing [sent. 2540 len. 7]: The truth conveyed is the revelation .
Parsing [sent. 2541 len. 26]: I do not deny that facts have been learned in dreams , but I would never call the communication of a mere fact a revelation .
Parsing [sent. 2542 len. 16]: Truth alone , beheld as such by the soul , is worthy of the name .
Parsing [sent. 2543 len. 13]: Facts , however , may themselves be the instruments of such revelation .
Parsing [sent. 2544 len. 21]: `` The dream I am now going to tell you was clearly enough led up to by my waking thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 2545 len. 79]: For I had been saying to myself ere I fell asleep : ` On the very Mount Sinai , that once burned with heavenly fire , and resounded with the thunder of a visible Presence , now old and cold , and swathed in the mists of legend and doubt , was discovered the most reverend , because most ancient record of the new dispensation which dethroned that mountain , and silenced the thunders of the pedagogue law !
Parsing [sent. 2546 len. 50]: Is it not possible that yet , in some ancient convent , insignificant to the eye of the traveller as modern Nazareth would be but for its ancient story , some one of the original gospel-manuscripts may lie , truthful and unblotted from the hand of the very evangelist ?
Parsing [sent. 2547 len. 6]: -- Oh lovely parchment ! '
Parsing [sent. 2548 len. 13]: I thought -- ` if eye of man might but see thee !
Parsing [sent. 2549 len. 9]: if lips of man might kiss thee ! '
Parsing [sent. 2550 len. 18]: and my heart swelled like the heart of a lover at the thought of such a boon .
Parsing [sent. 2551 len. 80]: -- Now , as you know , I live in a sort of live coffin here , '' continued the little man , striking his pigeon-breast , `` with a barrel-organ of discords in it , constantly out of order in one way or another ; and hence it comes that my sleep is so imperfect , and my dreams run more than is usual , as I believe , on in the direction of my last waking thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 2552 len. 15]: Well , that night , I dreamed thus : I was in a desert .
Parsing [sent. 2553 len. 9]: It was neither day nor night to me .
Parsing [sent. 2554 len. 10]: I saw neither sun , moon , nor stars .
Parsing [sent. 2555 len. 12]: A heavy , yet half-luminous cloud hung over the visible earth .
Parsing [sent. 2556 len. 44]: My heart was beating fast and high , for I was journeying towards a certain Armenian convent , where I had good ground for hoping I should find the original manuscript of the fourth gospel , the very handwriting of the apostle John .
Parsing [sent. 2557 len. 19]: That the old man did not write it himself , I never thought of that in my dream .
Parsing [sent. 2558 len. 40]: `` After I had walked on for a long , anything but weary time , I saw the level horizon line before me broken by a rock , as it seemed , rising from the plain of the desert .
Parsing [sent. 2559 len. 7]: I knew it was the monastery .
Parsing [sent. 2560 len. 27]: It was many miles away , and as I journeyed on it grew and grew , until it swelled huge as a hill against the sky .
Parsing [sent. 2561 len. 18]: At length I came up to the door , iron-clamped , deep-set in a low thick wall .
Parsing [sent. 2562 len. 5]: It stood wide open .
Parsing [sent. 2563 len. 19]: I entered , crossed a court , reached the door of the monastery itself , and again entered .
Parsing [sent. 2564 len. 62]: Every door to which I came stood open , but priest nor guide came to meet me , and I saw no man , and at length looked for none , but used my best judgment to get deeper and deeper into the building , for I scarce doubted that in its inmost penetralia I should find the treasure I sought .
Parsing [sent. 2565 len. 24]: At last I stood before a door hung with a curtain of rich workmanship , torn in the middle from top to bottom .
Parsing [sent. 2566 len. 10]: Through the rent I passed into a stone cell .
Parsing [sent. 2567 len. 7]: In the cell stood a table .
Parsing [sent. 2568 len. 8]: On the table was a closed book .
Parsing [sent. 2569 len. 6]: Oh how my heart beat !
Parsing [sent. 2570 len. 16]: Never but then have I known the feeling of utter preciousness in a thing possessed .
Parsing [sent. 2571 len. 21]: What doubts and fears would not this one lovely , oh unutterably beloved volume , lay at rest for ever !
Parsing [sent. 2572 len. 20]: How my eyes would dwell upon every stroke of every letter the hand of the dearest disciple had formed !
Parsing [sent. 2573 len. 10]: Nearly eighteen hundred years -- and there it lay !
Parsing [sent. 2574 len. 21]: -- and there WAS a man who DID hear the Master say the words , and did set them down !
Parsing [sent. 2575 len. 31]: I stood motionless , and my soul seemed to wind itself among the leaves , while my body stood like a pillar of salt , lost in its own gaze .
Parsing [sent. 2576 len. 32]: At last , with sudden daring , I made a step towards the table , and , bending with awe , stretched out my hand to lay it upon the book .
Parsing [sent. 2577 len. 31]: But ere my hand reached it , another hand , from the opposite side of the table , appeared upon it -- an old , blue-veined , but powerful hand .
Parsing [sent. 2578 len. 4]: I looked up .
Parsing [sent. 2579 len. 6]: There stood the beloved disciple !
Parsing [sent. 2580 len. 15]: His countenance was as a mirror which shone back the face of the Master .
Parsing [sent. 2581 len. 10]: Slowly he lifted the book , and turned away .
Parsing [sent. 2582 len. 39]: Then first I saw behind him as it were an altar whereon a fire of wood was burning , and a pang of dismay shot to my heart , for I knew what he was about to do .
Parsing [sent. 2583 len. 25]: He laid the book on the burning wood , and regarded it with a smile as it shrunk and shrivelled and smouldered to ashes .
Parsing [sent. 2584 len. 55]: Then he turned to me and said , while a perfect heaven of peace shone in his eyes : ` Son of man , the Word of God liveth and abideth for ever , not in the volume of the book , but in the heart of the man that in love obeyeth him .
Parsing [sent. 2585 len. 15]: And therewith I awoke weeping , but with the lesson of my dream . ''
Parsing [sent. 2586 len. 9]: A deep silence fell on the little company .
Parsing [sent. 2587 len. 14]: Then said Wingfold , `` I trust I have the lesson too . ''
Parsing [sent. 2588 len. 17]: He rose , shook hands with them , and , without another word , went home .
Parsing [sent. 2589 len. 3]: CHAPTER III .
Parsing [sent. 2590 len. 3]: ANOTHER SERMON .
Parsing [sent. 2591 len. 20]: It often seems to those in earnest about the right as if all things conspired to prevent their progress .
Parsing [sent. 2592 len. 32]: This of course is but an appearance , arising in part from this , that the pilgrim must be headed back from the side paths into which he is constantly wandering .
Parsing [sent. 2593 len. 42]: To Wingfold , however , it seemed that all things fell in to further his quest , which will not be so surprising if we remember that his was no intermittent repentant seeking , but the struggle of his whole energy .
Parsing [sent. 2594 len. 32]: And there are those who , in their very first seeking of it , are nearer to the kingdom of heaven than many who have for years believed themselves of it .
Parsing [sent. 2595 len. 77]: In the former there is more of the mind of Jesus , and when he calls them they recognize him at once and go after him ; while the others examine him from head to foot , and , finding him not sufficiently like the Jesus of their conception , turn their backs , and go to church , or chapel , or chamber , to kneel before a vague form mingled of tradition and fancy .
Parsing [sent. 2596 len. 40]: But the first shall be last , and the last first ; and there are from whom , be it penny or be it pound , what they have must be taken away because with them it lies useless .
Parsing [sent. 2597 len. 17]: For Wingfold , he soon found that his nature was being stirred to depths unsuspected before .
Parsing [sent. 2598 len. 70]: Hitherto nothing had ever roused him to genuine activity : his history not very happy ; his life not very interesting , his work not congenial , and paying itself in no satisfaction , his pleasures of a cold and common intellectual sort , -- he had dragged along , sustained , without the sense of its sustentation , by the germ within him of a slowly developing honesty .
Parsing [sent. 2599 len. 102]: But now that Conscience had got up into the guard 's seat , and Will had taken the reins , he found all his intellectual faculties in full play , keeping well together , heads up and traces tight , while the outrider Imagination , with his spotted dog Fancy , was always far ahead , but never beyond the sound of the guard 's horn ; and ever as they went , object after object hitherto beyond the radius of his interest , rose on the horizon of question , and began to glimmer in the dawn of human relation .
Parsing [sent. 2600 len. 81]: His first sermon is enough to show that he had begun to have thoughts of his own -- a very different thing from the entertaining of the thoughts of others , however well we may feed and lodge them -- thoughts which came to him not as things which sought an entrance , but as things that sought an exit -- cried for forms of embodiment that they might pass out of the infinite , and by incarnation become communicable .
Parsing [sent. 2601 len. 97]: The news of that strange first sermon had of course spread through the town , and the people came to church the next Sunday in crowds -- twice as many as the usual assembly -- some who went seldom , some who went nowhere , some who belonged to other congregations and communities -- mostly bent on witnessing whatever eccentricity the very peculiar young man might be guilty of next , but having a few among them who were sympathetically interested in seeing how far his call , if call it was , would lead him .
Parsing [sent. 2602 len. 12]: His second sermon was to the same purport as the first .
Parsing [sent. 2603 len. 52]: Preposing no text , he spoke to the following effect , and indeed the following are of the very words he uttered : `` The church wherein you now listen , my hearers , the pulpit wherein I now speak , stand here from of old in the name of Christianity .
Parsing [sent. 2604 len. 4]: What is Christianity ?
Parsing [sent. 2605 len. 33]: I know but one definition , the analysis of which , if the thing in question be a truth , must be the joyous labour of every devout heart to all eternity .
Parsing [sent. 2606 len. 21]: For Christianity does not mean what you think or what I think concerning Christ , but what IS OF Christ .
Parsing [sent. 2607 len. 31]: My Christianity , if ever I come to have any , will be what of Christ is in me ; your Christianity now is what of Christ is in you .
Parsing [sent. 2608 len. 41]: Last Sunday I showed you our Lord 's very words -- that he , and no other , was his disciple who did what he told him , -- and said therefore that I dared not call myself a disciple .
Parsing [sent. 2609 len. 30]: I say the same thing in saying now that I dare not call myself a Christian , lest I should offend him with my ` Lord , Lord ! '
Parsing [sent. 2610 len. 22]: Still it is , and I can not now help it , in the name of Christianity that I here stand .
Parsing [sent. 2611 len. 51]: I have , alas , with blameful and appalling thoughtlessness I subscribed my name , as a believer , to the Articles of the Church of England , with no better reason than that I was unaware of any dissent therefrom , and have been ordained one of her ministers .
Parsing [sent. 2612 len. 52]: The relations into which this has brought me I do not feel justified in severing at once , lest I should therein seem to deny that which its own illumination may yet show me to be true , and I desire therefore a little respite and room for thought and resolve .
Parsing [sent. 2613 len. 46]: But meantime it remains my business , as an honest man in the employment of the church , to do my best towards the setting forth of ` the claims of him upon whom that church is founded , and in whose name she exists .
Parsing [sent. 2614 len. 63]: As one standing on the outskirts of a listening Galilean crowd , a word comes now and then to my hungry ears and hungrier heart : I turn and tell it again to you -- not that ye have not heard it also , but that I may stir you up to ask yourselves : ` Do I then obey this word ?
Parsing [sent. 2615 len. 12]: Have I ever , have I once sought to obey it ?
Parsing [sent. 2616 len. 7]: Am I a pupil of Jesus ?
Parsing [sent. 2617 len. 6]: Am I a Christian ? '
Parsing [sent. 2618 len. 6]: Hear then of his words .
Parsing [sent. 2619 len. 12]: For me , they fill my heart with doubt and dismay .
Parsing [sent. 2620 len. 9]: `` The Lord says : Love your enemies .
Parsing [sent. 2621 len. 7]: Sayest thou , It is impossible ?
Parsing [sent. 2622 len. 23]: Then dost thou mock the word of him who said , I am the Truth , and has no part in him .
Parsing [sent. 2623 len. 9]: Sayest thou , Alas , I can not ?
Parsing [sent. 2624 len. 8]: Thou sayest true , I doubt not .
Parsing [sent. 2625 len. 19]: But hast thou tried whether he who made will not increase the strength put forth to obey him ?
Parsing [sent. 2626 len. 9]: `` The Lord says : Be ye perfect .
Parsing [sent. 2627 len. 36]: Dost thou then aim after perfection , or dost thou excuse thy wilful short-comings , and say , To err is human -- nor hopest that it may also be found human to grow divine ?
Parsing [sent. 2628 len. 18]: Then ask thyself , for thou hast good cause , whether thou hast any part in him .
Parsing [sent. 2629 len. 14]: `` The Lord said , Lay not up for yourselves treasures on earth .
Parsing [sent. 2630 len. 28]: My part is not now to preach against the love of money , but to ask you : Are you laying up for yourselves treasures on earth ?
Parsing [sent. 2631 len. 51]: As to what the command means , the honest heart and the dishonest must each settle in his own way ; but if your heart condemn you , what I have to say is , Call not yourselves Christians , but consider whether you ought not to become disciples indeed .
Parsing [sent. 2632 len. 49]: No doubt you can instance this , that , and the other man who does as you do , and of whom yet no man dreams of questioning the Christianity : it matters not a hair ; all that goes but to say that you are pagans together .
Parsing [sent. 2633 len. 10]: Do not mistake me : I judge you not .
Parsing [sent. 2634 len. 38]: I but ask you , as mouthpiece most unworthy of that Christianity in the name of which this building stands and we are met therein , to judge your own selves by the words of its founder .
Parsing [sent. 2635 len. 12]: `` The Lord said : Take no thought for your life .
Parsing [sent. 2636 len. 7]: Take no thought for the morrow .
Parsing [sent. 2637 len. 21]: Explain it as you may or can -- but ask yourselves -- Do I take no thought for my life ?
Parsing [sent. 2638 len. 9]: Do I take no thought for the morrow ?
Parsing [sent. 2639 len. 11]: and answer to yourselves whether or no ye are Christians .
Parsing [sent. 2640 len. 8]: `` The Lord says : Judge not .
Parsing [sent. 2641 len. 7]: Didst thou judge thy neighbour yesterday ?
Parsing [sent. 2642 len. 7]: Wilt thou judge him again to-morrow ?
Parsing [sent. 2643 len. 20]: Art thon judging him now in the very heart that within thy bosom sits hearing the words Judge not ?
Parsing [sent. 2644 len. 12]: Or wilt thou ask yet again -- Who is my neighbour ?
Parsing [sent. 2645 len. 19]: How then canst thou look to be of those that shall enter through the gates into the city ?
Parsing [sent. 2646 len. 49]: I tell thee not , for I profess not yet to know anything , but doth not thy own profession of Christianity counsel thee to fall upon thy face , and cry to him whom thou mockest , ' I am a sinful man , O Lord ' ?
Parsing [sent. 2647 len. 24]: `` The Lord said : All things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you , do ye even so to them .
Parsing [sent. 2648 len. 12]: Ye that buy and sell , do you obey this law ?
Parsing [sent. 2649 len. 5]: Examine yourselves and see .
Parsing [sent. 2650 len. 26]: Ye would that men should deal fairly by you ; do you deal fairly by them as ye would count fairness in them to you ?
Parsing [sent. 2651 len. 42]: -- If conscience makes you hang the head inwardly , however you sit with it erect in the pew , dare you add to your crime against the law and the prophets the insult to Christ of calling yourselves his disciples ?
Parsing [sent. 2652 len. 35]: `` Not every one that saith unto me , Lord , Lord , shall enter into the kingdom of heaven , but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven .
Parsing [sent. 2653 len. 16]: He will none but those who with him do the will of the Father . ''
Parsing [sent. 2654 len. 3]: CHAPTER IV .
Parsing [sent. 2655 len. 2]: NURSING .
Parsing [sent. 2656 len. 19]: I have of course given but the spine and ribs , as it were , of the sermon .
Parsing [sent. 2657 len. 7]: There is no place for more .
Parsing [sent. 2658 len. 21]: It is enough however to show that he came to the point -- and what can be better in preaching ?
Parsing [sent. 2659 len. 18]: Certainly he was making the best of the blunder that had led him up into that pulpit !
Parsing [sent. 2660 len. 57]: And on the other hand , whatever might be the various judgments and opinions of his hearers in respect of the sermon -- a thing about which the less any preacher allows himself to think the better -- many of them did actually feel that he had been preaching to them , which is saying much .
Parsing [sent. 2661 len. 88]: Even Mrs. Ramshorn was more silent than usual as they went home , and although -- not having acquainted herself , amongst others , with the sermons of Latimer -- she was profoundly convinced that such preaching was altogether contrary to the tradition , usage , and tone of the English Church , of which her departed dean remained to her the unimpeachable embodiment and type , the sole remark she made was , that Mr. Wingfold took quite too much pains to prove himself a pagan .
Parsing [sent. 2662 len. 10]: Mr. Bascombe was in the same mind as before .
Parsing [sent. 2663 len. 10]: `` I like the fellow , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2664 len. 15]: `` He says what he means , fair and full , and no shilly-shallying .
Parsing [sent. 2665 len. 10]: It 's all great rubbish , of course ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2666 len. 37]: And the widow of the dean of blessed memory had not a word to say in defence of the sermon , but , for her , let it go as the great rubbish he called it .
Parsing [sent. 2667 len. 106]: Indeed , not knowing the real mind of her nephew , she was nothing less than gratified to hear from him an opinion so comfortably hostile to that of this most uncomfortable of curates , whom you never could tell where to have , and whom never since he had confessed to wrong in the reading of his uncle 's sermons , and thus unwittingly cast a reproach upon the memory of him who had departed from the harassed company of deans militant to the blessed company of deans triumphant , had she invited to share at her table of the good things left behind .
Parsing [sent. 2668 len. 14]: `` Why do n't you ask him home to dinner , aunt ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2669 len. 11]: said Bascombe , after a pause unbroken by Mrs. Ramshorn .
Parsing [sent. 2670 len. 8]: `` Why should I , George ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2671 len. 4]: returned his aunt .
Parsing [sent. 2672 len. 17]: `` Has he not been abusing us all at a most ignorant and furious rate ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2673 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 2674 len. 15]: I did n't know , '' said the nephew , and held his peace .
Parsing [sent. 2675 len. 17]: Nor did the aunt perceive the sarcasm for the sake of pointing which he was silent .
Parsing [sent. 2676 len. 24]: But it was not lost , and George was paid in full by the flicker of a faint smile across Helen 's face .
Parsing [sent. 2677 len. 27]: As for Helen , the sermon had indeed laid a sort of feebly electrical hold upon her , the mere nervous influence of honesty and earnestness .
Parsing [sent. 2678 len. 38]: But she could not accuse herself of having ever made a prominent profession of Christianity , confirmation and communion notwithstanding ; and besides , had she not now all but abjured the whole thing in her heart ?
Parsing [sent. 2679 len. 24]: so that , if every word of what he said was true , not a word of it could be applied to her !
Parsing [sent. 2680 len. 34]: And what time had she to think about such far-away things as had happened eighteen centuries ago , when there was her one darling pining away with a black weight on his heart !
Parsing [sent. 2681 len. 51]: For , although Leopold was gradually recovering , a supreme dejection , for which his weakness was insufficient to account , prostrated his spirit , and at length drove Mr. Faber to ask Helen whether she knew of any disappointment or other source of mental suffering that could explain it .
Parsing [sent. 2682 len. 25]: She told him of the habit he had formed , and asked whether his being deprived of the narcotic might not be the cause .
Parsing [sent. 2683 len. 23]: He accepted the suggestion , and set himself , not without some success , to repair the injury the abuse had occasioned .
Parsing [sent. 2684 len. 24]: Still , although his physical condition plainly improved , the dejection continued , and Mr. Faber was thrown back upon his former conjecture .
Parsing [sent. 2685 len. 42]: Learning nothing , however , and yet finding that , as he advanced towards health , his dejection plainly deepened , he began at length to fear softening of the brain , but could discover no other symptom of such disease .
Parsing [sent. 2686 len. 57]: The earnestness of the doctor 's quest after a cause for what anyone might observe , added greatly to Helen 's uneasiness ; and besides , the fact itself began to undermine the hope of his innocence which had again sprung up and almost grown to assurance in the absence of any fresh contradiction from without .
Parsing [sent. 2687 len. 32]: Also , as his health returned , his sleep became more troubled ; he dreamed more , and showed by his increased agitation in his dreams that they were more painful .
Parsing [sent. 2688 len. 44]: In this respect his condition was at the worst always between two and three o'clock in the morning ; and having perceived this fact , Helen would never allow anyone except herself to sit up with him the first part of the night .
Parsing [sent. 2689 len. 21]: Increased anxiety and continued watching soon told upon her health yet more severely , and she lost appetite and complexion .
Parsing [sent. 2690 len. 48]: Still she slept well during the latter part of the morning , and it was in vain that aunt and doctor and nurse all expostulated with her upon the excess of her ministration : nothing should make her yield the post until her brother was himself again .
Parsing [sent. 2691 len. 25]: Nor was she without her reward , and that a sufficing one -- in the love and gratitude with which Leopold clung to her .
Parsing [sent. 2692 len. 51]: During the day also she spent every moment , except such as she passed in the open air , and at table with her aunt , by his bedside , reading and talking to him ; but as yet not a single allusion had been made to the frightful secret .
Parsing [sent. 2693 len. 55]: At length he was so much better that there was no longer need for anyone to sit up with him ; but then Helen had her bed put in the dressing-room , that at one o'clock she might be by his side , to sit there until three should be well over and gone .
Parsing [sent. 2694 len. 22]: Thus she gave up her whole life to him , and doubtless thereby gained much fresh interest in it for herself .
Parsing [sent. 2695 len. 55]: But the weight of the secret , and the dread of the law , were too much for her , and were gradually undermining that strength of dissimulation in which she had trusted , and which , in respect of cheerfulness , she had to exercise towards her brother as well as her aunt .
Parsing [sent. 2696 len. 31]: She struggled hard , for if those weak despairing eyes of his were to encounter weakness and despair in hers , madness itself would be at the door for both .
Parsing [sent. 2697 len. 52]: She had come nearly to the point of discovering that the soul is not capable of generating its own requirements , that it needs to be supplied from a well whose springs lie deeper than its own soil , in the infinite All , namely , upon which that soil rests .
Parsing [sent. 2698 len. 21]: Happy they who have found that those springs have an outlet in their hearts -- on the hill of prayer .
Parsing [sent. 2699 len. 14]: It was very difficult to lay her hands on reading that suited him .
Parsing [sent. 2700 len. 82]: Gifted with a glowing yet delicate eastern imagination , pampered and all but ruined , he was impatient of narratives of common life , whose current bore him to a reservoir and no sea ; while , on the other hand , some tales that seemed to Helen poverty-stricken flats of nonsense , or jumbles of false invention , would in her brother wake an interest she could not understand , appearing to afford him outlooks into regions to her unknown .
Parsing [sent. 2701 len. 12]: But from the moral element in any story he shrunk visibly .
Parsing [sent. 2702 len. 69]: She tried the German tales collected by the brothers Grimm , so popular with children of all ages ; but on the very first attempt she blundered into an awful one of murder and vengeance , in which , if the drawing was untrue , the colour was strong , and had to blunder clumsily out of it again , with a hot face and a cold heart .
Parsing [sent. 2703 len. 34]: At length she betook herself to the Thousand and One Nights , which she had never read , and found very dull , but which with Leopold served for what book could do .
Parsing [sent. 2704 len. 13]: In the rest of the house things went on much the same .
Parsing [sent. 2705 len. 29]: Old friends and their daughters called on Mrs. Ramshorn , and inquired after the invalid , and George Bascombe came almost every Saturday , and stayed till Monday .
Parsing [sent. 2706 len. 31]: But the moment the tide of her trouble began again to rise , Helen found herself less desirous of meeting one from whom she could hope neither help nor cheer .
Parsing [sent. 2707 len. 83]: It might be that future generations of the death-doomed might pass their poor life a little more comfortably that she had not been a bad woman , and she might be privileged to pass away from the world , as George taught her , without earning the curses of those that came after her ; but there was her precious brother lying before her with a horrible worm gnawing at his heart , and what to her were a thousand generations unborn !
Parsing [sent. 2708 len. 87]: Rather with Macbeth she might well `` wish the estate o ' the world were now undone '' -- most of all when , in the silent watches of the night , as she sat by the bedside of her beloved and he slept , his voice would come murmuring out of a dream , sounding so far away that it seemed as if his spirit only and not his lips had spoken the words , `` Oh Helen , darling , give me my knife .
Parsing [sent. 2709 len. 9]: Why will you not let me die ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2710 len. 7]: CHAPTER V. GLASTON AND THE CURATE .
Parsing [sent. 2711 len. 67]: Outside , the sun rose and set , never a crimson thread the less in the garment of his glory that the spirit of one of the children of the earth was stained with blood-guiltiness ; the moon came up and knew nothing of the matter ; the stars minded their own business ; and the people of Glaston were talking about their curate 's sermons .
Parsing [sent. 2712 len. 37]: Alas , it was about his sermons , and not the subject of them , that men talked , their interest mainly roused by their PECULIARITY , and what some called the oddity of the preacher .
Parsing [sent. 2713 len. 6]: What had come to him ?
Parsing [sent. 2714 len. 22]: He was not in the least like that for months after his appointment , and the change came all at once !
Parsing [sent. 2715 len. 16]: Yes -- it began with those extravagant notions about honesty in writing his own sermons !
Parsing [sent. 2716 len. 20]: It might have been a sunstroke , but it took him far too early in the year for that !
Parsing [sent. 2717 len. 11]: Softening of the brain it might be , poor fellow !
Parsing [sent. 2718 len. 8]: Was not excessive vanity sometimes a symptom ?
Parsing [sent. 2719 len. 4]: -- Poor fellow !
Parsing [sent. 2720 len. 4]: So said some .
Parsing [sent. 2721 len. 81]: But others said he was a clever fellow , and long-headed enough to know that that sort of thing attracted attention , and might open the way to a benefice , or at least an engagement in London , where eloquence was of more account than in a dead-and-alive country place like Glaston , from which the tide of grace had ebbed , leaving that great ship of the church , the Abbey , high and dry on the shore .
Parsing [sent. 2722 len. 11]: Others again judged him a fanatic -- a dangerous man .
Parsing [sent. 2723 len. 28]: Such did not all venture to assert that he had erred from the way , but what man was more dangerous than he who went too far ?
Parsing [sent. 2724 len. 54]: Possibly these forgot that the narrow way can hardly be one to sit down in comfortably , or indeed to be entered at all save by him who tries the gate with the intent of going all the way -- even should it lead up to the perfection of the Father in heaven .
Parsing [sent. 2725 len. 18]: `` But , '' they would in effect have argued , `` is not a fanatic dangerous ?
Parsing [sent. 2726 len. 13]: and is not an enthusiast always in peril of becoming a fanatic ?
Parsing [sent. 2727 len. 26]: -- Be his enthusiasm for what it may -- for Jesus Christ , for God himself , such a man is dangerous -- most dangerous !
Parsing [sent. 2728 len. 33]: There are so many things , comfortably settled like Presumption 's tubs upon their own bottoms , which such men would , if they could , at once upset and empty ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2729 len. 10]: Others suspected a Romanizing drift in the whole affair .
Parsing [sent. 2730 len. 24]: `` Wait until he gathers influence , '' they said , `` and a handful of followers , and then you 'll see !
Parsing [sent. 2731 len. 13]: They 'll be all back to Rome together in a month ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2732 len. 44]: As the wind took by the tail St. Peter 's cock on the church spire and whirled it about , so did the wind of words in Glaston rudely seize and flack hither and thither the spiritual reputation of Thomas Wingfold , curate .
Parsing [sent. 2733 len. 98]: And all the time , the young man was wrestling , his life in his hand , with his own unbelief ; while upon his horizon ever and anon rose the glimmer of a great aurora , or the glimpse of a boundless main -- if only he could have been sure they were no mirage of his own parched heart and hungry eye -- that they were thoughts in the mind of the Eternal , and THRERFORE had appeared in his , even as the Word was said to have become flesh and dwelt with men !
Parsing [sent. 2734 len. 53]: The next moment he would be gasping in that malarious exhalation from the marshes of his neglected heart -- the counter-fear , namely , that the word under whose potent radiance the world seemed on the verge of budding forth and blossoming as the rose , was TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE .
Parsing [sent. 2735 len. 33]: `` Yes , much too good , if there be no living , self-willing Good , '' said Polwarth one evening , in answer to the phrase just dropped from his lips .
Parsing [sent. 2736 len. 23]: `` But if there be such a God as alone could be God , can anything be too good to be true ?
Parsing [sent. 2737 len. 13]: -- too good for such a God as contented Jesus Christ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2738 len. 53]: At one moment he was ready to believe everything , even to that strangest , yet to me right credible miracle of the fish and the piece of money , and the next to doubt whether man had ever dared utter the words , `` I and the Father are one . ''
Parsing [sent. 2739 len. 57]: Tossed he was and tormented in spirit , calling even aloud sometimes to know if there was a God anywhere hearing his prayer , sure only of this , that whatever else any being might be , if he heard not prayer , he could not be the God for whom his soul cried and fainted .
Parsing [sent. 2740 len. 54]: Sometimes there came to him , it is true , what he would gladly have taken for an answer , but it was nothing more than the sudden descent of a kind of calmness on his spirit , which , for aught he could tell , might be but the calm of exhaustion .
Parsing [sent. 2741 len. 38]: His knees were sore with kneeling , his face white with thinking , his eyes dim with trouble ; for when once a man has set out to find God , he must find him or die .
Parsing [sent. 2742 len. 14]: This was the inside reality whose outcome set the public of Glaston babbling .
Parsing [sent. 2743 len. 65]: It was from this that George Bascombe magisterially pronounced him a hypochondriac , worrying his brain about things that had no existence -- as George himself could with confidence testify , not once having seen the sight of them , heard the sound of them , or imagined in his heart that they ought to be , or even that they might possibly be .
Parsing [sent. 2744 len. 10]: He pronounced indeed their existence inconsistent with his own .
Parsing [sent. 2745 len. 41]: The thought had never rippled the grey mass of his self-satisfied brain that perhaps there was more of himself than what he counted he himself yet knew , and that possibly these matters had a consistent relation with parts unknown .
Parsing [sent. 2746 len. 5]: Poor , poverty-stricken Wingfold !
Parsing [sent. 2747 len. 10]: -- actually craving for things beneath Bascombe 's notice !
Parsing [sent. 2748 len. 11]: actually crying for something higher and brighter than the moon !
Parsing [sent. 2749 len. 8]: How independent was George compared with Thomas !
Parsing [sent. 2750 len. 85]: -- content to live what he called his life , be a benefactor to men , chiefly in ridding their fancies of the goblins of aspiration , then die his death , and have done with the business ; while poor misguided , weak-brained , hypochondriacal Thomas could be contented with nothing less than the fulfilment of the promise of a certain man who perhaps never existed : `` The Father and I will come to him and make our abode with him . ''
Parsing [sent. 2751 len. 13]: Yet Thomas too had his weakness for the testimony of the senses .
Parsing [sent. 2752 len. 28]: If he did not , like George , refuse to believe without it , he yet could not help desiring signs and wonders that he might believe .
Parsing [sent. 2753 len. 46]: Of this the following poem was a result , and I give it the more willingly because it will show how the intellectual nature of the man had advanced , borne on the waves that burst from the fountains of the great deep below it .
Parsing [sent. 2754 len. 83]: O Lord , if on the wind , at cool of day , I heard one whispered word of mighty grace ; If through the darkness , as in bed I lay , But once had come a hand upon my face ; If but one sign that might not be mistook , Had ever been , since first thy face I sought , I should not now be doubting o'er a book , But serving thee with burning heart and thought .
Parsing [sent. 2755 len. 5]: So dreams that heart .
Parsing [sent. 2756 len. 36]: But to my heart I say , Turning my face to front the dark and wind : Such signs had only barred anew His way Into thee , longing heart , thee , wildered mind .
Parsing [sent. 2757 len. 45]: They asked the very Way , where lies the way ; The very Son , where is the Father 's face ; How he could show himself , if not in clay , Who was the lord of spirit , form , and space .
Parsing [sent. 2758 len. 67]: My being , Lord , will nevermore be whole Until thou come behind mine ears and eyes , Enter and fill the temple of my soul With perfect contact -- such a sweet surprise -- Such presence as , before it met the view , The prophet-fancy could not once foresee , Though every corner of the temple knew By very emptiness its need of thee .
Parsing [sent. 2759 len. 35]: When I keep ALL thy words , no favoured some -- Heedless of worldly winds or judgment 's tide , Then , Jesus , thou wilt with thy Father come -- O ended prayers !
Parsing [sent. 2760 len. 7]: -- and in my soul abide .
Parsing [sent. 2761 len. 4]: Ah long delay !
Parsing [sent. 2762 len. 7]: -- ah cunning , creeping sin !
Parsing [sent. 2763 len. 31]: I shall but fail and cease at length to try : O Jesus , though thou wilt not yet come in , Knock at my window as thou passest by .
Parsing [sent. 2764 len. 3]: CHAPTER VI .
Parsing [sent. 2765 len. 3]: THE LINEN-DRAPER .
Parsing [sent. 2766 len. 31]: But there was yet another class amongst those who on that second day heard the curate testify what honestly he might , and no more , concerning Jesus of Nazareth .
Parsing [sent. 2767 len. 15]: So far as he learned , however , that class consisted of one individual .
Parsing [sent. 2768 len. 43]: On the following Tuesday morning he went into the shop of the chief linen-draper of Glaston , for he was going to a funeral , and wanted a new pair of gloves that he might decline those which would be offered him .
Parsing [sent. 2769 len. 27]: A young woman waited on him , but Mr. Drew , seeing him from the other end of the shop , came and took her place .
Parsing [sent. 2770 len. 53]: When he was fitted , had paid for his purchase , and was turning to take his leave , the draper , with what appeared a resolution suddenly forced from hesitation , leaned over the counter and said : `` Would you mind walking up stairs for a few minutes , sir ?
Parsing [sent. 2771 len. 8]: I ask it as a great favour .
Parsing [sent. 2772 len. 10]: I want very much to speak to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2773 len. 55]: `` I shall be most happy , '' answered Wingfold -- conventionally , it must be allowed , for in reality he anticipated expostulation , and having in his public ministrations to do his duty against his own grain , he had no fancy for encountering other people 's grain as well in private .
Parsing [sent. 2774 len. 38]: Mr. Drew opened certain straits in the counter , and the curate followed him through them , then through a door , up a stair , and into a comfortable dining-room , which smelt strongly of tobacco .
Parsing [sent. 2775 len. 17]: There Mr. Drew placed for him a chair , and seated himself in front of him .
Parsing [sent. 2776 len. 44]: The linen-draper was a middle-aged , middle-sized , stoutish man , with plump rosy cheeks , keen black eyes , and features of the not uncommon pug-type , ennobled and harmonized by a genuine expression of kindly good-humour , and an excellent forehead .
Parsing [sent. 2777 len. 10]: His dark hair was a little streaked with gray .
Parsing [sent. 2778 len. 43]: His manner , which , in the shop , had been of the shop , that is , more deferential and would-be pleasing than Wingfold liked , settled as he took his seat into one more resembling that of a country gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 2779 len. 13]: It was courteous and friendly , but clouded with a little anxiety .
Parsing [sent. 2780 len. 34]: An uncomfortable pause following , Wingfold stumbled in with the question , `` I hope Mrs. Drew is well , '' without reflecting whether he had really ever heard of a Mrs. Drew .
Parsing [sent. 2781 len. 6]: The draper 's face flushed .
Parsing [sent. 2782 len. 16]: `` It is twenty years since I lost her , sir , '' he returned .
Parsing [sent. 2783 len. 10]: In his tone and manner there was something peculiar .
Parsing [sent. 2784 len. 14]: `` I beg your pardon , '' said Wingfold , with self-accusing sincerity .
Parsing [sent. 2785 len. 28]: `` I will be open with you sir , '' continued his host : `` she left me -- with another -- nearly twenty years ago . ''
Parsing [sent. 2786 len. 12]: `` I am ashamed of my inadvertence , '' rejoined Wingfold .
Parsing [sent. 2787 len. 21]: `` I have been such a short time here , and -- '' `` Do not mention it , sir .
Parsing [sent. 2788 len. 6]: How could you help it ?
Parsing [sent. 2789 len. 17]: Besides , it was not here the thing took place , but a hundred miles away .
Parsing [sent. 2790 len. 13]: I hope I should before long have referred to the fact myself .
Parsing [sent. 2791 len. 18]: But now I desire , if you will allow me , to speak of something different . ''
Parsing [sent. 2792 len. 11]: `` I am at your service , '' answered Wingfold .
Parsing [sent. 2793 len. 6]: `` Thank you , sir .
Parsing [sent. 2794 len. 17]: -- I was in your church last Sunday , '' resumed the draper after a pause .
Parsing [sent. 2795 len. 61]: `` I am not one of your regular hearers , sir ; but your sermon that day set me thinking , and instead of thinking less when Monday came , I have been thinking more and more ever since ; and when I saw you in the shop , I could not resist the sudden desire to speak to you .
Parsing [sent. 2796 len. 23]: If you have time , sir , I hope you will allow me to come to the point my own way ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2797 len. 19]: Wingfold assured him that his time was at his own disposal , and could not be better occupied .
Parsing [sent. 2798 len. 8]: Mr. Drew thanked him and went on .
Parsing [sent. 2799 len. 66]: `` Your sermon , I must confess , sir , made me uncomfortable -- no fault of yours , sir -- all my own -- though how much the fault is , I hardly know : use and custom are hard upon a man , sir , and you would have a man go by other laws than those of the world he lives in .
Parsing [sent. 2800 len. 16]: The earth is the Lord 's and the fulness thereof -- you will doubtless say .
Parsing [sent. 2801 len. 30]: That is over the Royal Exchange in London , I think ; but it is not the laws of the Lord that are specially followed inside for all that .
Parsing [sent. 2802 len. 22]: However , it is not with other people we have to do , but with ourselves -- as you will say .
Parsing [sent. 2803 len. 11]: Well then it is for myself I am troubled now .
Parsing [sent. 2804 len. 44]: Mr. Wingfold , sir , I am not altogether at ease in my own mind as to the way I have made my money -- what little money I have -- no great sum , but enough to retire upon when I please .
Parsing [sent. 2805 len. 27]: I would not have you think me worse than I am , but I am sincerely desirous of knowing what you would have me do . ''
Parsing [sent. 2806 len. 21]: `` My dear sir , '' returned Wingfold , `` I am the very last to look to for enlightenment .
Parsing [sent. 2807 len. 10]: I am as ignorant of business as any child .
Parsing [sent. 2808 len. 25]: I am not aware that I ever bought anything except books and clothes , or ever sold anything except a knife to a schoolfellow .
Parsing [sent. 2809 len. 32]: I had bought it the day before for half-a-crown , but there was a spot of rust on one of the blades , and therefore I parted with it for twopence .
Parsing [sent. 2810 len. 33]: The only thing I can say is : if you have been in the way of doing anything you are no longer satisfied with , do n't do it any more . ''
Parsing [sent. 2811 len. 10]: `` But just there comes my need of help .
Parsing [sent. 2812 len. 22]: You must do something with your business , and DO N'T DO IT , do n't tell me what to do .
Parsing [sent. 2813 len. 25]: Mind I do not confess to having done anything the trade would count inadmissible , or which is not done in the largest establishments .
Parsing [sent. 2814 len. 20]: What I now make a question of I learned in one of the most respectable of London houses . ''
Parsing [sent. 2815 len. 39]: `` You imply that a man in your line who would not do certain things the doing of which has contributed to the making of your fortune , would by the ordinary dealer be regarded as Quixotic ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2816 len. 33]: `` He would ; but that there may be such men I am bound to allow , for here am I wishing with all my heart that I had never done them .
Parsing [sent. 2817 len. 19]: Right gladly would I give up the money I have made by them to be rid of them .
Parsing [sent. 2818 len. 6]: I am unhappy about it .
Parsing [sent. 2819 len. 35]: But I should never have dared to confess it to you , sir , or , I believe , to anyone , but for the confession you made in the pulpit some time ago .
Parsing [sent. 2820 len. 11]: I was not there , but I heard of it .
Parsing [sent. 2821 len. 25]: I foolishly judged you unwise to accuse yourself before an unsympathizing public -- but here am I in consequence accusing myself to you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2822 len. 13]: `` To no unsympathising hearer , though , '' said the curate .
Parsing [sent. 2823 len. 68]: `` It made me want to go and hear you preach , '' pursued the draper ; `` for no one could say but it was plucky -- and we all like pluck , sir , '' he added , with a laugh that puckered his face , showed the whitest of teeth , and swept every sign of trouble from the half-globe of his radiant countenance .
Parsing [sent. 2824 len. 36]: `` Then you know sum and substance of what I can do for you , Mr. Drew : I can sympathize with you ; -- not a whit more or less am I capable of .
Parsing [sent. 2825 len. 31]: I am the merest beginner and dabbler in doing right myself , and have more need to ask you to teach me than to set up for teaching you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2826 len. 8]: `` That 's the beauty of you !
Parsing [sent. 2827 len. 12]: -- excuse me , sir , '' cried the draper triumphantly .
Parsing [sent. 2828 len. 30]: `` You do n't pretend to teach us anything , but you make us so uncomfortable that we go about ever after asking ourselves what we ought to do .
Parsing [sent. 2829 len. 37]: Till last Sunday , I had always looked upon myself as an honest man : let me see : it would be more correct to say I looked on myself as a man QUITE HONEST ENOUGH .
Parsing [sent. 2830 len. 14]: That I do not feel so now , is your doing , sir .
Parsing [sent. 2831 len. 31]: You said in your sermon last Sunday , and specially to business men : ` Do you do to your neighbour as you would have your neighbour do to you ?
Parsing [sent. 2832 len. 29]: If not , how can you suppose that the lord of Christians will acknowledge you as a disciple of his , that is , as a Christian ? '
Parsing [sent. 2833 len. 16]: Now I was even surer of being a Christian than of being an honest man .
Parsing [sent. 2834 len. 129]: You will hardly believe it , and what to think of it myself I now hardly know , but I had satisfied myself , more or less , that I had gone through all the necessary stages of being born again , and it is now many years since I was received into a Christian church -- dissenting of course , I mean ; for what I count the most important difference after all between church and dissent is that the one , right or wrong , requires for communion a personal profession of faith , and credible proof of conversion -- which I believed I gave them , and have been for years , I shame to say it , one of the deacons of that community .
Parsing [sent. 2835 len. 8]: But it shall not be for long .
Parsing [sent. 2836 len. 44]: To return to my story , however : I was indignant at being called upon from a church-pulpit to raise in myself the question whether or not I was a Christian ; -- for had I not put my faith in the -- ?
Parsing [sent. 2837 len. 21]: But I will avoid theology , for I have paid more regard to that than has proved good for me .
Parsing [sent. 2838 len. 40]: Suffice it to say that I was now driven from the tests of the theologians to try myself by the words of the Master : he must be the best theologian after all , must n't he , sir ?
Parsing [sent. 2839 len. 17]: -- and so there and then I tried the test of doing to your neighbour AS .
Parsing [sent. 2840 len. 43]: But I could NOT get it to work ; I could not see how to use it , and while I was trying how to make it apply , you were gone , and I lost all the rest of the sermon .
Parsing [sent. 2841 len. 66]: `` Now whether it was anything you had said coming back to me , I can not tell , but next day , that was yesterday , all at once , in the shop here , as I was serving Mrs. Ramshorn , the thought came to me : How would Jesus Christ have done if he had been a draper instead of a carpenter ?
Parsing [sent. 2842 len. 16]: When she was gone , I went up to my room to think about it .
Parsing [sent. 2843 len. 17]: And there it seemed -- that first I must know how he did as a carpenter .
Parsing [sent. 2844 len. 8]: But that we are told nothing about .
Parsing [sent. 2845 len. 8]: I could get no light upon that .
Parsing [sent. 2846 len. 11]: And so my thoughts turned again to the original question .
Parsing [sent. 2847 len. 12]: -- How would he have done had he been a draper ?
Parsing [sent. 2848 len. 26]: And , strange to say , I seemed to know far more about that than the other , and to have something to go upon .
Parsing [sent. 2849 len. 23]: In fact I had a sharp and decisive answer concerning several things of which I had dared to make a question . ''
Parsing [sent. 2850 len. 17]: `` The vision of the ideal woke the ideal in yourself , '' said Wingfold thoughtfully .
Parsing [sent. 2851 len. 28]: `` I do n't know that I quite understand that , '' returned Mr. Drew ; `` but the more I thought the more dissatisfied I became .
Parsing [sent. 2852 len. 25]: And , in a word , it has come to this , that I must set things right , or give up business . ''
Parsing [sent. 2853 len. 12]: `` That would be no victory , '' remarked the curate .
Parsing [sent. 2854 len. 17]: `` I know it , and shall not yield without a struggle , I promise you .
Parsing [sent. 2855 len. 57]: That same afternoon , taking the opportunity of having overheard one of them endeavouring to persuade an old farmer 's wife to her disadvantage , I called all my people , and told them that if ever I heard one of them do such a thing , I would turn him or her away at once .
Parsing [sent. 2856 len. 54]: But when I came to look at it , I saw how difficult it would be to convict of the breach of such a vague law ; and unfortunately too I had some time ago introduced the system of a small percentage to the sellers , making it their interest to force sales .
Parsing [sent. 2857 len. 15]: That however is easily rectified , and I shall see to it at once .
Parsing [sent. 2858 len. 19]: But I do wish I had a more definite law to follow than that of doing AS ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2859 len. 15]: `` Would not more light inside do as well as clearer law outside ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2860 len. 3]: suggested Wingfold .
Parsing [sent. 2861 len. 15]: `` How can I tell till I have had a chance of trying ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2862 len. 24]: returned the draper with a smile , which speedily vanished as he went on : `` Then again , there 's about profits !
Parsing [sent. 2863 len. 7]: How much ought I to take ?
Parsing [sent. 2864 len. 16]: Am I to do as others do , and always be ruled by the market ?
Parsing [sent. 2865 len. 18]: Am I bound to give my customers the advantage of any special bargain I may have made ?
Parsing [sent. 2866 len. 59]: And then again -- for I do a large wholesale business with the little country shops -- if I learn that one of my customers is going down hill , have I , or have I not , a right to pounce upon him , and make him pay me , to the detriment of his other creditors ?
Parsing [sent. 2867 len. 13]: There 's no end of questions , you see , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 2868 len. 15]: `` I am the worst possible man to ask , '' returned Wingfold again .
Parsing [sent. 2869 len. 24]: `` I might , from very ignorance , judge that wrong which is really right , or that right which is really wrong .
Parsing [sent. 2870 len. 26]: But one thing I begin to see , that before a man can do right by his neighbour , he must love him as himself .
Parsing [sent. 2871 len. 27]: Only I am such a poor scholar in these high things that , as you have just said , I can not pretend to teach anybody .
Parsing [sent. 2872 len. 26]: That sermon was but an appeal to men 's own consciences whether they kept the words of the Lord by whose name they called themselves .
Parsing [sent. 2873 len. 24]: Except in your case , Mr. Drew , I am not aware that one of the congregation has taken it to heart . ''
Parsing [sent. 2874 len. 13]: `` I am not sure of that , '' returned the draper .
Parsing [sent. 2875 len. 32]: `` Some talk amongst my own people has made me fancy that , perhaps , though talk be but froth , the froth may rise from some hot work down below .
Parsing [sent. 2876 len. 25]: Never man could tell from the quiet way I am talking to you , how much I have felt these few days past . ''
Parsing [sent. 2877 len. 26]: Wingfold looked him in the face : the earnestness of the man was plain in his eyes , and his resolve stamped on every feature .
Parsing [sent. 2878 len. 51]: The curate thought of Zacchaeus ; thought of Matthew at the receipt of custom ; thought with some shame of certain judgments concerning trade , and shopkeepers especially , that seemed somehow to have bred in him like creeping things -- for whence they had come he could not tell .
Parsing [sent. 2879 len. 101]: Now it was clear as day that -- always provided the man Christ Jesus can be and is with his disciples always to the end of the world -- a tradesman might just as soon have Jesus behind the counter with him , teaching him to buy and sell IN HIS NAME , that is , as he would have done it , as an earl riding over his lands might have him with him , teaching him how to treat his farmers and cottagers -- all depending on how the one did his trading and the other his earling .
Parsing [sent. 2880 len. 7]: A mere truism , is it ?
Parsing [sent. 2881 len. 23]: Yes , it is , and more is the pity ; for what is a truism , as most men count truisms ?
Parsing [sent. 2882 len. 102]: What is it but a truth that ought to have been buried long ago in the lives of men -- to send up for ever the corn of true deeds and the wine of loving kindness , -- but instead of being buried in friendly soil , is allowed to lie about , kicked hither and thither in the dry and empty garret of their brains , till they are sick of the sight and sound of it , and to be rid of the thought of it , declare it to be no living truth but only a lifeless truism !
Parsing [sent. 2883 len. 36]: Yet in their brain that truism must rattle until they shift it to its rightful quarters in their heart , where it will rattle no longer but take root and be a strength and loveliness .
Parsing [sent. 2884 len. 31]: Is a truth to cease to be uttered because no better form than that of some divine truism -- say of St. John Boanerges -- can be found for it ?
Parsing [sent. 2885 len. 40]: To the critic the truism is a sea-worn , foot-trodden pebble ; to the obedient scholar , a radiant topaz , which , as he polishes it with the dust of its use , may turn into a diamond .
Parsing [sent. 2886 len. 7]: `` Jesus buying and selling ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2887 len. 5]: said Wingfold to himself .
Parsing [sent. 2888 len. 5]: `` And why not ?
Parsing [sent. 2889 len. 27]: Did Jesus make chairs and tables , or boats perhaps , which the people of Nazareth wanted , without any admixture of trade in the matter ?
Parsing [sent. 2890 len. 5]: Was there no transaction ?
Parsing [sent. 2891 len. 7]: No passing of money between hands ?
Parsing [sent. 2892 len. 9]: Did they not pay his father for them ?
Parsing [sent. 2893 len. 31]: Was his Father 's way of keeping things going in the world , too vile for the hands of him whose being was delight in the will of that Father ?
Parsing [sent. 2894 len. 26]: No ; there must be a way of handling money that is noble as the handling of the sword in the hands of the patriot .
Parsing [sent. 2895 len. 22]: Neither the mean man who loves it , nor the faithless man who despises it , knows how to handle it .
Parsing [sent. 2896 len. 23]: The former is one who allows his dog to become a nuisance , the latter one who kicks him from his sight .
Parsing [sent. 2897 len. 25]: The noble man is he who so truly does the work given him to do that the inherent nobility of that work is manifest .
Parsing [sent. 2898 len. 50]: And the trader who trades nobly is nobler surely than the high-born who , if he carried the principles of his daily life into trade , would be as pitiful a sneak as any he that bows and scrapes falsely behind that altar of lies , his counter . ''
Parsing [sent. 2899 len. 25]: -- All flat truisms I know , but no longer such to Wingfold to whom they now for the first time showed themselves truths .
Parsing [sent. 2900 len. 44]: He had taken a kindly leave of the draper , promising to call again soon , and had reached the room-door on his way out , when he turned suddenly and said , `` Did you think to try praying , Mr. Drew ?
Parsing [sent. 2901 len. 91]: Men , whose minds , if I may venture to judge , seem to me , from their writings , of the very highest order , have really and positively believed that the loftiest activity of a man 's being lay in prayer to the unknown Father of that being , and that light in the inward parts was the certain consequence -- that , in very truth , not only did the prayer of the man find the ear of God , but the man himself found God Himself .
Parsing [sent. 2902 len. 23]: I have no right to an opinion , but I have a splendid hope that I shall one day find it true .
Parsing [sent. 2903 len. 15]: The Lord said a man must go on praying and not lose heart . ''
Parsing [sent. 2904 len. 20]: With the words he walked out , and the deacon thought of his many prayers at prayer-meetings and family-worships .
Parsing [sent. 2905 len. 43]: The words of a young man who seemed to have only just discovered that there was such a thing as prayer , who could not pretend to be sure about it , but hoped splendidly , made him ashamed of them all .
Parsing [sent. 2906 len. 3]: CHAPTER VII .
Parsing [sent. 2907 len. 2]: RACHEL .
Parsing [sent. 2908 len. 25]: Wingfold went straight to his friend Polwarth , and asked him if he would allow him to bring Mr. Drew some evening to tea .
Parsing [sent. 2909 len. 7]: `` You mean the linen-draper ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2910 len. 3]: asked Polwarth .
Parsing [sent. 2911 len. 9]: `` Certainly , if you wish it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2912 len. 11]: `` Some troubles are catching , '' said the curate .
Parsing [sent. 2913 len. 8]: `` Drew has caught my disease . ''
Parsing [sent. 2914 len. 8]: `` I am delighted to hear it .
Parsing [sent. 2915 len. 27]: It would be hard to catch a better , and it 's one a rich man , as they say he is , seldom does catch .
Parsing [sent. 2916 len. 12]: But I always liked his round , good-humoured , honest face .
Parsing [sent. 2917 len. 14]: If I remember rightly , he had a sore trial in his wife .
Parsing [sent. 2918 len. 14]: It is generally understood that she ran away with some fellow or other .
Parsing [sent. 2919 len. 11]: But that was before he came to live in Glaston .
Parsing [sent. 2920 len. 15]: -- Would you mind looking in upon Rachel for a few minutes , sir ?
Parsing [sent. 2921 len. 18]: She is not so well to-day , and has not been out of her own room . ''
Parsing [sent. 2922 len. 10]: `` With all my heart , '' answered Wingfold .
Parsing [sent. 2923 len. 11]: `` I am sorry to hear she is suffering . ''
Parsing [sent. 2924 len. 15]: `` She is always suffering more or less , '' said the little man .
Parsing [sent. 2925 len. 13]: `` But she enjoys life notwithstanding , as you may clearly see .
Parsing [sent. 2926 len. 23]: It is to her only a mitigated good , and that , I trust , for the sake of an unmitigated one .
Parsing [sent. 2927 len. 8]: -- Come this way , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 2928 len. 11]: He led the curate to the room next his own .
Parsing [sent. 2929 len. 12]: It was a humble little garret , but dainty with whiteness .
Parsing [sent. 2930 len. 26]: One who did not thoroughly know her , might have said it was like her life , colourless , but bright with innocence and peace .
Parsing [sent. 2931 len. 55]: The walls were white ; the boards of the uncarpeted floor were as white as scrubbing could make old deal ; the curtains of windows and bed were whiteness itself ; the coverlet was white ; so was the face that looked smiling over the top of it from the one low white pillow .
Parsing [sent. 2932 len. 30]: But although Wingfold knew that face so well , he almost started at the sight of it now : in the patience of its suffering it was positively lovely .
Parsing [sent. 2933 len. 43]: All that was painful to see was hidden ; the crooked little body lay at rest in the grave of the bed-clothes ; the soul rose from it , and looked , gracious with womanhood , in the eyes of the curate .
Parsing [sent. 2934 len. 50]: `` I can not give you my hand , '' she said smiling , as he went softly towards her , feeling like Moses when he put off his shoes , `` for I have such a pain in my arm , I can not well raise it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2935 len. 24]: The curate bowed reverentially , seated himself in a chair by her bedside , and , like a true comforter , said nothing .
Parsing [sent. 2936 len. 19]: `` Do n't be sorry for me , Mr. Wingfold , '' said her sweet voice at length .
Parsing [sent. 2937 len. 19]: `` The poor dwarfie , as the children call me , is not a creature to be pitied .
Parsing [sent. 2938 len. 61]: You do n't know how happy I am as I lie here , knowing my uncle is in the next room , and will come the moment I call him -- and that there is one nearer still , '' she added in a lower voice , almost in a whisper , `` whom I have n't even to call .
Parsing [sent. 2939 len. 15]: I am his , and he shall do with me just as he likes .
Parsing [sent. 2940 len. 86]: I fancy sometimes , when I have to lie still , that I am a little sheep , tied hands and feet -- I should have said all four feet , if I am a sheep '' -- and here she gave a little merry laugh -- `` lying on an altar -- the bed here -- burning away , in the flame of life , that consumes the deathful body -- burning , heart and soul and sense , up to the great Father .
Parsing [sent. 2941 len. 18]: -- Forgive me , Mr. Wingfold , for talking about myself , but you looked so miserable !
Parsing [sent. 2942 len. 12]: and I knew it was your kind heart feeling for me .
Parsing [sent. 2943 len. 16]: But I need not , for that , have gone on at such a rate .
Parsing [sent. 2944 len. 7]: I am ashamed of myself ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2945 len. 23]: `` On the contrary , I am exceedingly obliged to you for honouring me by talking so freely , '' said Wingfold .
Parsing [sent. 2946 len. 15]: `` It is a great satisfaction to find that suffering is not necessarily unhappiness .
Parsing [sent. 2947 len. 24]: I could be well content to suffer also , Miss Polwarth , if with the suffering I might have the same peace . ''
Parsing [sent. 2948 len. 28]: `` Sometimes I am troubled , '' she answered ; `` but generally I am in peace , and sometimes too happy to dare speak about it .
Parsing [sent. 2949 len. 39]: -- Would the persons you and my uncle were talking about the other day -- would they say all my pleasant as well as my painful thoughts came from the same cause -- vibrations in my brain ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2950 len. 4]: `` No doubt .
Parsing [sent. 2951 len. 25]: They would say , I presume , that the pleasant thoughts come from regular , and the unpleasant from irregular motions of its particles .
Parsing [sent. 2952 len. 9]: They must give the same origin to both .
Parsing [sent. 2953 len. 27]: Would you be willing to acknowledge that only your pleasant thoughts had a higher origin , and that your painful ones came from physical sources ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2954 len. 24]: Because of a headache and depression of spirits , Wingfold had been turning over similar questions in his own mind the night before .
Parsing [sent. 2955 len. 13]: `` I see , '' said the dwarfie -- `` I see .
Parsing [sent. 2956 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 2957 len. 24]: There are sad thoughts sometimes which in their season I would not lose , for I would have their influences with me always .
Parsing [sent. 2958 len. 23]: In their season they are better than a host of happy ones , and there is joy at the root of all .
Parsing [sent. 2959 len. 20]: But if they did come from physical causes , would it follow that they did not come from God ?
Parsing [sent. 2960 len. 18]: Is he not the God of the dying as well as the God of the living ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2961 len. 38]: `` If there be a God , Miss Polwarth , '' returned Wingfold eagerly , `` then is he God everywhere , and not a maggot can die any more than a Shakespeare be born without him .
Parsing [sent. 2962 len. 20]: He is either enough , that is , all in all , or he is not at all . ''
Parsing [sent. 2963 len. 21]: `` That is what I think -- because it is best : -- I can give no better reason . ''
Parsing [sent. 2964 len. 18]: `` If there be a God , there can be no better reason , '' said Wingfold .
Parsing [sent. 2965 len. 30]: This IF of Wingfold 's was , I need hardly now say , an IF of bare honesty , and came of no desire to shake an unthinking confidence .
Parsing [sent. 2966 len. 25]: Neither , had it been of the other sort , could it have shaken Rachel 's , for her confidence was full of thinking .
Parsing [sent. 2967 len. 23]: As little could it shock her , for she hardly missed a sentence that passed between her uncle and his new friend .
Parsing [sent. 2968 len. 44]: She made no reply , never imagining it her business to combat the doubts of a man whom she knew to be eager after the truth , and being guiltless of any tendency , because she believed , to condemn doubt as wicked .
Parsing [sent. 2969 len. 5]: A short silence followed .
Parsing [sent. 2970 len. 13]: `` How delightful it must be to feel well and strong ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2971 len. 5]: said Rachel at length .
Parsing [sent. 2972 len. 11]: `` I ca n't help often thinking of Miss Lingard .
Parsing [sent. 2973 len. 16]: It 's always Miss Lingard comes up to me when I think of such things .
Parsing [sent. 2974 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 2975 len. 10]: ai n't she beautiful and strong , Mr. Wingfold ?
Parsing [sent. 2976 len. 12]: -- and sits on her horse as straight as a rush !
Parsing [sent. 2977 len. 8]: It does one good to see her .
Parsing [sent. 2978 len. 9]: Just fancy me on a great tall horse !
Parsing [sent. 2979 len. 10]: What a bag of potatoes I should look ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2980 len. 72]: She burst into a merry laugh , and then came a few tears , which were not all of the merriment of which she let them pass as the consequence , remarking , as she wiped them away , `` But no one can tell , Mr. Wingfold , -- and I 'm sure Miss Lingard would be astonished to hear -- what pleasure I have while lying unable to move .
Parsing [sent. 2981 len. 13]: I suppose I benefit by what people call the law of compensation !
Parsing [sent. 2982 len. 6]: How I hate the word !
Parsing [sent. 2983 len. 34]: As if THAT was the way the Father of Jesus Christ did , and not his very best to get his children , elder brothers and prodigal sons , home to his heart !
Parsing [sent. 2984 len. 13]: You heard what my uncle said about dreams the other day ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2985 len. 7]: she resumed after a little pause .
Parsing [sent. 2986 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 2987 len. 11]: I thought it very sensible , '' replied the curate .
Parsing [sent. 2988 len. 13]: `` It all depends on the sort , do n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2989 len. 3]: said Rachel .
Parsing [sent. 2990 len. 12]: `` Some of mine I would not give for a library .
Parsing [sent. 2991 len. 14]: They make me grow , telling me things I should never learn otherwise .
Parsing [sent. 2992 len. 14]: I do n't mean any rubbish about future events , and such like .
Parsing [sent. 2993 len. 29]: Of all useless things a knowledge of the future seems to me the most useless , for what are you to do with a thing before it exists ?
Parsing [sent. 2994 len. 24]: Such a knowledge could only bewilder you as to the right way to take -- would make you see double instead of single .
Parsing [sent. 2995 len. 10]: That 's not the sort I mean at all .
Parsing [sent. 2996 len. 12]: -- You wo n't laugh at me , Mr. Wingfold ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2997 len. 10]: `` I can scarcely imagine anything less likely . ''
Parsing [sent. 2998 len. 12]: `` Then I do n't mind opening my toy-box to you .
Parsing [sent. 2999 len. 39]: -- In my dreams , for instance , I am sometimes visited by such a sense of freedom as fills me with a pure bliss unknown to my waking thoughts except as a rosy cloud on the horizon .
Parsing [sent. 3000 len. 34]: As if they were some heavenly corporation , my dreams present me , not with the freedom of some poor little city like London , but with the freedom of all space . ''
Parsing [sent. 3001 len. 52]: The curate sat and listened with wonder -- but with no sense of unfitness ; such speech and such thought suited well with the face that looked up from the low pillow with its lovely eyes -- for lovely they were , with a light that had both flash and force .
Parsing [sent. 3002 len. 41]: `` I do n't believe , '' she went on , `` that even Miss Lingard has more of the blessed sense of freedom and strength and motion when she is on horseback than I have when I am asleep .
Parsing [sent. 3003 len. 17]: The very winds of my dreams will make me so unspeakabably happy that I wake weeping .
Parsing [sent. 3004 len. 28]: Do not tell me it is gone then , for I continue so happy that I can hardly get to sleep again to hunt for more joy .
Parsing [sent. 3005 len. 14]: Do n't say it is an unreality -- for where does freedom lie ?
Parsing [sent. 3006 len. 8]: In the body or in the mind ?
Parsing [sent. 3007 len. 20]: What does it matter whether my body be lying still or moving from one spot of space to another ?
Parsing [sent. 3008 len. 14]: What is the good of motion but to produce the feeling of freedom ?
Parsing [sent. 3009 len. 18]: The feeling is everything , and if I have it , that is all that I want .
Parsing [sent. 3010 len. 15]: Bodily motion would indeed disturb it for me -- lay fetters on my spirit .
Parsing [sent. 3011 len. 53]: -- Sometimes , again , I dream of a new flower -- one never before beheld by mortal eye -- with some strange , wonderful quality in it , perhaps , that makes it a treasure , like that flower of Milton 's invention -- haemony -- in Comus , you know .
Parsing [sent. 3012 len. 57]: But one curious thing is that that strange quality will never be recalled in waking hours ; so that what it was I can never tell -- as if it belonged to other regions than the life of this world : I retain only the vaguest memory of its power , and marvel , and preciousness .
Parsing [sent. 3013 len. 38]: -- Sometimes it is a little poem or a song I dream of , or some strange musical instrument , perhaps like one of those I have seen angels with in a photograph from an old picture .
Parsing [sent. 3014 len. 16]: And somehow with the instrument always comes the knowledge of how to play upon it .
Parsing [sent. 3015 len. 58]: So you see , sir , as it has pleased God to send me into the world as crooked as a crab , and nearly as lame as a seal , it has pleased him also to give me the health and riches of the night to strengthen me for the pains and poverties of the day .
Parsing [sent. 3016 len. 21]: -- You rejoice in a beautiful thought when it comes to you , Mr. Wingfold -- do you not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3017 len. 15]: `` When it comes to me , '' answered Wingfold significantly -- almost petulantly .
Parsing [sent. 3018 len. 9]: Could it be that he envied the dwarf-girl ?
Parsing [sent. 3019 len. 14]: `` Then is the thought any worse because it comes in a shape ?
Parsing [sent. 3020 len. 18]: -- or is the feeling less of a feeling that it is born in a dream ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3021 len. 16]: `` I need no convincing , I admit all you say , '' returned Wingfold .
Parsing [sent. 3022 len. 9]: `` Why are you so silent , then ?
Parsing [sent. 3023 len. 21]: You make me think you are objecting inside to everything I am saying , '' rejoined Rachel with a smile .
Parsing [sent. 3024 len. 32]: `` Partly because I fear you are exciting yourself too much and will suffer in consequence , '' answered the curate , who had noted the rosy flush on her face .
Parsing [sent. 3025 len. 9]: The same moment her uncle re-entered the room .
Parsing [sent. 3026 len. 24]: `` I have been trying to convince Mr. Wingfold that there MAY be some good in dreaming , uncle , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 3027 len. 4]: `` Successfully ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3028 len. 3]: asked Polwarth .
Parsing [sent. 3029 len. 7]: `` Unnecessarily , '' interjected Wingfold .
Parsing [sent. 3030 len. 9]: `` I required for conviction only the facts .
Parsing [sent. 3031 len. 22]: Why should I suppose that , if there be a God , he is driven out of us by sleep ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3032 len. 55]: `` It is an awful thing , '' said Polwarth , `` to think -- that this feeble individuality of ours , the offspring of God 's individuality , should have some power , and even more will than power , to close its door against him , and keep house without him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3033 len. 9]: `` But what sort of a house ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3034 len. 3]: murmured Wingfold .
Parsing [sent. 3035 len. 33]: `` Yes , uncle , '' said Rachel ; `` but think how he keeps about us , haunting the doors and windows like the very wind , watching to get in !
Parsing [sent. 3036 len. 26]: And sometimes he makes of himself a tempest , that both doors and windows fly open , and he enters in fear and dismay . ''
Parsing [sent. 3037 len. 12]: The prophetic in the uncle was the poetic in the niece .
Parsing [sent. 3038 len. 31]: `` For you and me , uncle , '' she went on , `` he made the doors and windows so rickety that they COULD not keep him out . ''
Parsing [sent. 3039 len. 18]: `` Ye are the temples of the Holy Ghost , '' said the curate , almost unconsciously .
Parsing [sent. 3040 len. 9]: `` Some of us a little ruinous ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3041 len. 4]: rejoined the girl .
Parsing [sent. 3042 len. 24]: So full was her soul of a lively devotion that she took the liberties of a child of the house with sacred things .
Parsing [sent. 3043 len. 10]: `` But , Mr. Wingfold , '' she continued .
Parsing [sent. 3044 len. 22]: `` I must tell you one more curious thing about my dreams : I NEVER dream of being crooked and dwarfish .
Parsing [sent. 3045 len. 24]: I do n't dream that I am straight either ; I suppose I feel all right , and therefore never think about it .
Parsing [sent. 3046 len. 10]: That makes me fancy my soul must be straight .
Parsing [sent. 3047 len. 10]: -- Do n't you think so , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3048 len. 10]: `` Indeed I do , '' said Wingfold warmly .
Parsing [sent. 3049 len. 17]: `` I 'm afraid I shall be telling you some of my dreams some day . ''
Parsing [sent. 3050 len. 28]: `` We are rather given to that weakness , '' said Polwarth , -- `` so much so as to make me fear for our brains sometimes .
Parsing [sent. 3051 len. 12]: But a crooked rose-tree may yet bear a good rose . ''
Parsing [sent. 3052 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 3053 len. 17]: you are thinking of my poor father , uncle , I know , '' said Rachel .
Parsing [sent. 3054 len. 16]: `` His was a straight stem and a fine rose , only overblown , perhaps .
Parsing [sent. 3055 len. 42]: -- I do n't think I need be much afraid of that , for if I were to go out of my mind , I should not have strength to live -- unless indeed I knew God through all the madness .
Parsing [sent. 3056 len. 10]: I think my father did in a way . ''
Parsing [sent. 3057 len. 22]: `` It was quite plain he did , '' answered her uncle , `` and that in no feeble way either .
Parsing [sent. 3058 len. 27]: -- Some day I must tell you , '' -- here he turned to Wingfold -- `` about that brother of mine , Rachel 's father .
Parsing [sent. 3059 len. 22]: I should even like to show you a manuscript he left behind him -- surely one of the strangest ever written !
Parsing [sent. 3060 len. 24]: It would be well worth printing if that would ensure its falling into the hands of those who could read through the madness .
Parsing [sent. 3061 len. 25]: -- But we have talked quite long enough for your head , child ; I will take Mr. Wingfold into the next room . ''
Parsing [sent. 3062 len. 3]: CHAPTER VIII .
Parsing [sent. 3063 len. 3]: THE BUTTERFLY .
Parsing [sent. 3064 len. 18]: As Wingfold walked home that afternoon , he thought much of what he had heard and seen .
Parsing [sent. 3065 len. 44]: `` If there be a God , '' he said to himself , `` then all is well , for certainly he would not give being to such a woman , and then throw her aside as a failure , and forget her .
Parsing [sent. 3066 len. 17]: It is strange to see , though , how he permits his work to be thwarted .
Parsing [sent. 3067 len. 20]: To be the perfect God notwithstanding , he must be able to turn the very thwarting to higher furtherance .
Parsing [sent. 3068 len. 18]: Do n't we see something of the sort in life -- the vigorous nursed by the arduous ?
Parsing [sent. 3069 len. 30]: Is it presumptuous to imagine God saying to Rachel : ` Trust me , and bear , and I will do better for thee than thou canst think ? '
Parsing [sent. 3070 len. 19]: Certainly the one who most needs the comfort of such a faith , in this case HAS it .
Parsing [sent. 3071 len. 13]: I wish I could be as sure of him as Rachel Polwarth !
Parsing [sent. 3072 len. 23]: -- But then , '' he added , smiling to himself , `` she has had her crooked spine to help her !
Parsing [sent. 3073 len. 20]: It seems as if nothing less than the spiritual beholding of the Eternal will produce at least absolute belief .
Parsing [sent. 3074 len. 33]: And till then what better or indeed other proof can the less receive of the presence of the greater than the expansion of its own being under the influences of that greater ?
Parsing [sent. 3075 len. 45]: But my plague now is that the ideas of religion are so grand , and the things all around it in life so common-place , that they give the lie to each other from morning to night -- in my mind , I mean .
Parsing [sent. 3076 len. 5]: Which is the true ?
Parsing [sent. 3077 len. 20]: a loving , caring father , or the grinding of cruel poverty and the naked exposure to heedless chance ?
Parsing [sent. 3078 len. 31]: How is it that , while the former seems the only right , reasonable , and all-sufficing thing , it should yet come more naturally to believe in the latter ?
Parsing [sent. 3079 len. 36]: And yet , when I think of it , I never did come closer to believing in the latter than is indicated by terror of its possible truth -- so many things looked like it .
Parsing [sent. 3080 len. 15]: -- Then , what has nature in common with the Bible and its metaphysics ?
Parsing [sent. 3081 len. 12]: -- There I am wrong -- she has a thousand things .
Parsing [sent. 3082 len. 19]: The very wind on my face seems to rouse me to fresh effort after a pure healthy life !
Parsing [sent. 3083 len. 6]: Then there is the sunrise !
Parsing [sent. 3084 len. 8]: There is the snowdrop in the snow !
Parsing [sent. 3085 len. 5]: There is the butterfly !
Parsing [sent. 3086 len. 17]: There is the rain of summer , and the clearing of the sky after a storm !
Parsing [sent. 3087 len. 11]: There is the hen gathering her chickens under her wing !
Parsing [sent. 3088 len. 27]: -- I begin to doubt whether there be the common-place anywhere except in our own mistrusting nature , that will cast no care upon the Unseen .
Parsing [sent. 3089 len. 67]: It is with me , in regard to my better life , as it was with the disciples in regard to their bodily life , when they were for the time rendered incapable of understanding the words of our Lord by having forgotten to take bread in the boat : they were so afraid of being hungry that they could think of nothing but bread . ''
Parsing [sent. 3090 len. 26]: Such were some of the curate 's thoughts as he walked home , and they drove him to prayer , in which came more thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 3091 len. 33]: When he reached his room he sat down at his table , and wove and knotted and pieced together the following verses , venturing that easy yet perilous thing , a sonnet .
Parsing [sent. 3092 len. 52]: I give here its final shape , not its first or second : Methought I floated sightless , nor did know That I had ears until I heard the cry As of a mighty man in agony : `` How long , Lord , shall I lie thus foul and slow ?
Parsing [sent. 3093 len. 30]: The arrows of thy lightning through me go , And sting and torture me -- yet here I lie A shapeless mass that scarce can mould a sigh . ''
Parsing [sent. 3094 len. 21]: The darkness thinned ; I saw a thing below , Like sheeted corpse , a knot at head and feet .
Parsing [sent. 3095 len. 20]: Slow clomb the sun the mountains of the dead , And looked upon the world : the silence broke !
Parsing [sent. 3096 len. 4]: A blinding struggle !
Parsing [sent. 3097 len. 12]: then the thunderous beat Of great exulting pinions stroke on stroke !
Parsing [sent. 3098 len. 9]: And from that world a mighty angel fled .
Parsing [sent. 3099 len. 36]: But upon the heels of the sonnet came , as was natural , according to the law of reaction , a fresh and more appalling , because more self-assertive and verisimilous invasion of the commonplace .
Parsing [sent. 3100 len. 10]: What a foolish , unreal thing he had written !
Parsing [sent. 3101 len. 22]: He caught up his hat and stick and hurried out , thinking to combat the demon better in the open air .
Parsing [sent. 3102 len. 3]: CHAPTER IX .
Parsing [sent. 3103 len. 3]: THE COMMON-PLACE .
Parsing [sent. 3104 len. 11]: It was evening , and the air was still warm .
Parsing [sent. 3105 len. 27]: Pine Street was almost empty , save of the red sun , which blinded him so that wherever he looked he could only see great sunblots .
Parsing [sent. 3106 len. 37]: All but a few of the shops were closed , but amongst the few he was surprised to find that of his friend the linendraper , who had always been a strong advocate of early closing .
Parsing [sent. 3107 len. 14]: The shutters were up , however , though the door stood wide open .
Parsing [sent. 3108 len. 4]: He peeped in .
Parsing [sent. 3109 len. 25]: To his sun-blinded eyes the shop looked very dark , but he thought he saw Mr. Drew talking to some one , and entered .
Parsing [sent. 3110 len. 33]: He was right ; it was the draper himself , and a poor woman with a child on one arm , and a print dress she had just bought on the other .
Parsing [sent. 3111 len. 19]: The curate leaned against the counter , and waited until business should be over to address his friend .
Parsing [sent. 3112 len. 9]: `` Is Mr. Drew an embryonic angel ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3113 len. 9]: he half felt , half thought within himself .
Parsing [sent. 3114 len. 11]: `` Is this shop the chrysalis of a great psyche ?
Parsing [sent. 3115 len. 29]: Will the draper , with his round good-humoured face and puckering smile , ever spread thunderous wings and cleave the air up to the throne of God ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3116 len. 26]: `` I can not tell you how it goes against me to take that woman 's money , '' said the voice of the draper .
Parsing [sent. 3117 len. 21]: The curate woke up in the presence of the unwinged , and saw that the woman had left the shop .
Parsing [sent. 3118 len. 20]: `` I did let her have the print at cost-price , '' Mr. Drew went on , laughing merrily .
Parsing [sent. 3119 len. 10]: `` That was all I could venture on . ''
Parsing [sent. 3120 len. 7]: `` Where was the danger ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3121 len. 24]: `` Ah , you do n't know so well as I do the good of having some difficulty in getting what you need !
Parsing [sent. 3122 len. 28]: To ease the struggles of the poor , unless it be in sickness or absolute want , I have repeatedly proved to be a cruel kindness . ''
Parsing [sent. 3123 len. 15]: `` Then you do n't sell to the poor women at cost-price always ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3124 len. 10]: `` No -- only to the soldiers ' wives .
Parsing [sent. 3125 len. 13]: They have a very hard life of it , poor things ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3126 len. 9]: `` That is your custom , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3127 len. 17]: `` For the last ten years , but I do n't let them know it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3128 len. 16]: `` Is it for the soldiers ' wives you keep your shop open so late ?
Parsing [sent. 3129 len. 18]: I thought you were the great supporter of early closing in Glaston , '' said the curate .
Parsing [sent. 3130 len. 59]: `` I will tell you how it happened to-night , '' answered the draper , and as he spoke he turned round , not his long left ear upon the pivot of his skull , but his whole person upon the pivot of the counter -- to misuse the word pivot with Wordsworth -- and bolted the shop-door .
Parsing [sent. 3131 len. 37]: `` After the young men had put up the shutters and were gone , '' he said , returning to the counter , `` leaving me as usual to bolt the door , I fell a-thinking .
Parsing [sent. 3132 len. 36]: Outside , the street was full of sunlight , but only enough came in to show how gloomy the place was without more of it , and the back of the shop was nearly dark .
Parsing [sent. 3133 len. 20]: It was very still too -- so still that the silence seemed to have taken the shape of gloom .
Parsing [sent. 3134 len. 24]: Pardon me for talking in this unbusiness-like way : a man ca n't be a draper always ; he must be foolish sometimes .
Parsing [sent. 3135 len. 9]: Thirty years ago I used to read Tennyson .
Parsing [sent. 3136 len. 12]: I believe I was amongst the earliest of his admirers . ''
Parsing [sent. 3137 len. 4]: `` Foolish ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3138 len. 5]: echoed Wingfold , thoughtfully .
Parsing [sent. 3139 len. 23]: `` You see , '' the draper went on , `` there IS something solemn in the quiet after business is over .
Parsing [sent. 3140 len. 46]: Sometimes it 's more so , sometimes less ; but this night it came upon me that the shop felt like a chapel -- had the very air of one somehow , and so I fell a thinking , and forgot to shut the door .
Parsing [sent. 3141 len. 59]: How it began I do n't know , but my past life came up to me , and I remembered how , when I was a young man , I used to despise my father 's business , to which he was bringing me up , and feed my fancy with things belonging to higher walks in life .
Parsing [sent. 3142 len. 19]: Then I saw that must have been partly how I fell into the mistake of marrying Mrs. Drew .
Parsing [sent. 3143 len. 14]: She was the daughter of a doctor in our town , a widower .
Parsing [sent. 3144 len. 38]: He was in poor health , and unable to make much of his practice , so that when he died she was left destitute , and for that reason alone , I do believe , accepted me .
Parsing [sent. 3145 len. 21]: What followed you know : she went away with a man who used to travel for a large Manchester house .
Parsing [sent. 3146 len. 8]: I have never heard of her since .
Parsing [sent. 3147 len. 26]: `` After she left me , a sort of something which I think I may call the disease of self-preservation , laid hold upon me .
Parsing [sent. 3148 len. 15]: I must acknowledge that the loss of my wife was not altogether a misery .
Parsing [sent. 3149 len. 22]: She despised my trade , which drove me to defend it -- and the more bitterly that I also despised it .
Parsing [sent. 3150 len. 11]: There was therefore a good deal of strife between us .
Parsing [sent. 3151 len. 20]: I did not make allowance enough for the descent she had made from a professional father to a trade-husband .
Parsing [sent. 3152 len. 29]: I forgot that , if she was to blame for marrying me for bread , I was to blame for marrying her to enlarge myself with her superiority .
Parsing [sent. 3153 len. 42]: After she was gone , I was aware of a not unwelcome calm in the house , and in the emptiness of that calm came the demon of selfishness sevenfold into my heart , and took up his abode with me .
Parsing [sent. 3154 len. 25]: From that time I busied myself only about two things -- the safety of my soul , and a good provision for my body .
Parsing [sent. 3155 len. 31]: I joined the church I had occasion to mention to you before , sir , grew a little harder in my business dealings , and began to lay by money .
Parsing [sent. 3156 len. 31]: And so , ever since , have I been going on till I heard your sermon the other day , which I hope has waked me up to something better .
Parsing [sent. 3157 len. 23]: -- All this long story is but to let you understand how I was feeling when that woman came into the shop .
Parsing [sent. 3158 len. 22]: I told you how , in the dusk and the silence , it was as if I were in the chapel .
Parsing [sent. 3159 len. 8]: I found myself half-listening for the organ .
Parsing [sent. 3160 len. 64]: Then the verse of a hymn came into my mind -- I ca n't tell where or when I had met with it , but it had stuck to me : Let me stand ever at the door , And keep it from the entering sin , That so thy temple , walls and floor , Be pure for thee to enter in .
Parsing [sent. 3161 len. 32]: `` Now that , you see , is said of the temple of the heart ; but somehow things went rather cross-cut that evening -- they got muddled in my head .
Parsing [sent. 3162 len. 50]: It seemed as if I was the door-keeper of my shop , and at the same time as if my shop , spreading out and dimly vanishing in the sacred gloom , was the temple of the Holy Ghost , out of which I had to keep the sin .
Parsing [sent. 3163 len. 28]: And with the thought , a great awe fell upon me : could it be -- might it not be that God was actually in the place ?
Parsing [sent. 3164 len. 16]: -- that in the silence he was thinking -- in the gloom he was knowing ?
Parsing [sent. 3165 len. 23]: I laid myself over the counter , with my face in my hands , and went on half thinking , half praying .
Parsing [sent. 3166 len. 28]: All at once the desire arose burning in my heart : Would to God my house were in truth a holy place , haunted by his presence !
Parsing [sent. 3167 len. 6]: ` And wherefore not ? '
Parsing [sent. 3168 len. 14]: rejoined something within me -- heart or brain or something deeper than either .
Parsing [sent. 3169 len. 6]: ` Is thy work unholy ?
Parsing [sent. 3170 len. 5]: Are thy deeds base ?
Parsing [sent. 3171 len. 7]: Is thy buying or selling dishonest ?
Parsing [sent. 3172 len. 11]: Is it all for thyself and nothing for thy fellows ?
Parsing [sent. 3173 len. 7]: Is it not a lawful calling ?
Parsing [sent. 3174 len. 11]: Is it , or is it not , of God ?
Parsing [sent. 3175 len. 23]: If it be of God , and yet he be not present , then surely thy lawful calling thou followest unlawfully . ''
Parsing [sent. 3176 len. 12]: So there I was -- brought back to the old story .
Parsing [sent. 3177 len. 16]: And I said to myself , ` God knows I want to follow it lawfully .
Parsing [sent. 3178 len. 11]: Am I not even now seeking how to do so ?
Parsing [sent. 3179 len. 11]: But this , though true , did not satisfy me .
Parsing [sent. 3180 len. 15]: To follow it lawfully -- even in his sight -- no longer seemed enough .
Parsing [sent. 3181 len. 12]: -- Was there then no possibility of raising it to dignity ?
Parsing [sent. 3182 len. 18]: Did the business of Zacchaeus remain , after the visit of Jesus , a contemptible one still ?
Parsing [sent. 3183 len. 7]: Could not mine be made Christian ?
Parsing [sent. 3184 len. 26]: Was there no corner in the temple where a man might buy and sell and not be driven out by the whip of small cords ?
Parsing [sent. 3185 len. 25]: -- I heard a step in the shop , and lifting my head , saw a poor woman with a child in her arms .
Parsing [sent. 3186 len. 61]: Annoyed at being found in that posture , like one drunk or in despair ; annoyed also with myself for not having shut the door , with my usual first tendency to injustice a harsh word was trembling on my very lips , when suddenly something made me look round in a kind of maze on the dusky back shop .
Parsing [sent. 3187 len. 19]: A moment more and I understood : God was waiting to see what truth was in my words .
Parsing [sent. 3188 len. 19]: That is just how I felt it , and I hope I am not irreverent in saying so .
Parsing [sent. 3189 len. 27]: Then I saw that the poor woman looked frightened -- I suppose at my looks and gestures -- perhaps she thought me out of my mind .
Parsing [sent. 3190 len. 38]: I made haste and received her , and listened to her errand as if she had been a duchess -- say rather an angel of God , for such I felt her in my heart to be .
Parsing [sent. 3191 len. 35]: She wanted a bit of dark print with a particular kind of spot in it , which she had seen in the shop some months before , but had not been able to buy .
Parsing [sent. 3192 len. 13]: I turned over everything we had , and was nearly in despair .
Parsing [sent. 3193 len. 27]: At last , however , I found the very piece which had ever since haunted her fancy -- just enough of it left for a dress !
Parsing [sent. 3194 len. 29]: But all the time I sought it , I felt as if I were doing God service -- or at least doing something he wanted me to do .
Parsing [sent. 3195 len. 14]: It sounds almost ludicrous now , but -- '' `` God forbid ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3196 len. 3]: said Wingfold .
Parsing [sent. 3197 len. 12]: `` I 'm glad you do n't think so , sir .
Parsing [sent. 3198 len. 7]: I was afraid you would . ''
Parsing [sent. 3199 len. 21]: `` Had the thing been a trifle , I should still have said the same , '' returned the curate .
Parsing [sent. 3200 len. 31]: `` But who with any heart would call it -- a trifle to please the fancy of a poor woman , one who is probably far oftener vexed than pleased ?
Parsing [sent. 3201 len. 18]: She had been brooding over this dress -- you took trouble to content her with her desire .
Parsing [sent. 3202 len. 13]: Who knows what it may do for the growth of the woman ?
Parsing [sent. 3203 len. 15]: I know what you 've done for me by the story of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3204 len. 37]: `` She did walk out pleased-like , '' said the draper , '' -- and left me more pleased than she , -- and so grateful to her for coming -- you ca n't think ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3205 len. 35]: `` I begin to suspect , '' said the curate , after a pause , `` that the common transactions of life are the most sacred channels for the spread of the heavenly leaven .
Parsing [sent. 3206 len. 41]: There was ten times more of the divine in selling her that gown as you did , in the name of God , than in taking her into your pew and singing out of the same hymn-book with her . ''
Parsing [sent. 3207 len. 22]: `` I should be glad to do that next though , if I had the chance , '' said Mr. Drew .
Parsing [sent. 3208 len. 51]: `` You must not think , because he has done me so little good , that our minister is not a faithful preacher ; and , owing you more than heart can tell , sir , I like chapel better than church , and consider it nearer the right way .
Parsing [sent. 3209 len. 35]: I do n't mean to be a turncoat , and leave Drake for you , sir ; I must give up my deaconship , but I wo n't my pew or my subscription . ''
Parsing [sent. 3210 len. 19]: `` Quite right , Mr. Drew , '' said Wingfold ; `` that could do nothing but harm .
Parsing [sent. 3211 len. 12]: I have just been reading what our Lord says about proselytizing .
Parsing [sent. 3212 len. 4]: Good night . ''
Parsing [sent. 3213 len. 5]: CHAPTER X. HOME AGAIN .
Parsing [sent. 3214 len. 58]: The curate had entered the draper 's shop in the full blaze of sunset , but the demon of unbelief sat on his shoulders ; he could get no nearer his heart , but that was enough to make of the `` majestical roof fretted with golden fire ... a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours . ''
Parsing [sent. 3215 len. 54]: When he left the shop , the sun was far below the horizon , and the glory had faded out of the west ; but the demon had fled , and the brown feathers of the twilight were beautiful as the wings of the silver dove , sprung heavenwards from among the pots .
Parsing [sent. 3216 len. 50]: And as he went he reasoned with himself -- `` Either there is a God , and that God the perfect heart of truth and loveliness , or all poetry and art is but an unsown , unplanted , rootless flower , crowning a somewhat symmetrical heap of stones .
Parsing [sent. 3217 len. 48]: The man who sees no beauty in its petals , finds no perfume in its breath , may well accord it the parentage of the stones ; the man whose heart swells beholding it will be ready to think it has roots that reach below them . ''
Parsing [sent. 3218 len. 59]: The curate 's search , it will be remarked , had already widened greatly the sphere of his doubts ; but , the larger the field , the greater the chance of finding a marl-pit ; and , if there be such a thing as truth , every fresh doubt is yet another finger-post pointing towards its dwelling .
Parsing [sent. 3219 len. 26]: -- So talked the curate to himself , and , full in the face , rounding the corner of a street , met George Bascombe .
Parsing [sent. 3220 len. 62]: The young barrister held out his large hospitable hand at the full length of his arm , and spread abroad his wide chest to greet him , and they went through the ceremony of shaking hands , -- which , even in their case , I can not judge so degrading and hypocritical as the Latin nations seem to consider it .
Parsing [sent. 3221 len. 7]: Then Wingfold had the first word .
Parsing [sent. 3222 len. 24]: `` I have not yet had an opportunity of thanking you for the great service you have done me , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3223 len. 29]: `` I am glad to know I have such an honour ; but -- '' `` I mean , in opening my eyes to my true position . ''
Parsing [sent. 3224 len. 7]: `` Ah , my dear fellow !
Parsing [sent. 3225 len. 16]: I was sure you only required to have your attention turned in the right direction .
Parsing [sent. 3226 len. 3]: When -- ?
Parsing [sent. 3227 len. 3]: -- ah !
Parsing [sent. 3228 len. 21]: -- I -- I was on the verge of committing the solecism of asking you when you thought of resigning .
Parsing [sent. 3229 len. 2]: Ha !
Parsing [sent. 3230 len. 3]: ha ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3231 len. 17]: `` Not yet , '' replied Wingfold to the question thus at once withdrawn and put .
Parsing [sent. 3232 len. 31]: `` The more I look into the matter , the more reason I find for hoping it may be possible for me to -- to -- keep the appointment . ''
Parsing [sent. 3233 len. 4]: `` Oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3234 len. 53]: `` The further I inquire , the more am I convinced that , if not in a certain portion of what the church teaches , then nowhere else , and assuredly not in what you teach , shall I find anything by which life can either account for or justify itself . ''
Parsing [sent. 3235 len. 11]: `` But if what you find is not true ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3236 len. 10]: cried George , with a burst of semi-grand indignation .
Parsing [sent. 3237 len. 22]: `` But if what I find should be true , even though you should never be able to see it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3238 len. 4]: returned the curate .
Parsing [sent. 3239 len. 24]: And as if disjected by an explosion between them , the two men were ten paces asunder , each hurrying his own way .
Parsing [sent. 3240 len. 29]: `` If I ca n't prove there is a God , '' said Wingfold to himself , `` as little surely can he prove there is none . ''
Parsing [sent. 3241 len. 30]: But then came the thought -- `` The fellow will say that , there being no sign of a God , the burden of proof lies with me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3242 len. 29]: And therewith he saw how useless it would be to discuss the question with any one who , not seeing him , had no desire to see him .
Parsing [sent. 3243 len. 31]: `` No , '' he said , `` my business is not to prove to any other man that there is a God , but to find him for myself .
Parsing [sent. 3244 len. 18]: If I should find him , then will be time enough to think of showing him . ''
Parsing [sent. 3245 len. 16]: And with that his thoughts turned from Bascombe , and went back to the draper .
Parsing [sent. 3246 len. 34]: When he reached home , he took out his sonnet , but , after working at it for a little while , he found that he must ease his heart by writing another .
Parsing [sent. 3247 len. 13]: Here it is : Methought that in a solemn church I stood .
Parsing [sent. 3248 len. 23]: Its marble acres , worn with knees and feet , Lay spread from , door to door , from street to street .
Parsing [sent. 3249 len. 37]: Midway the form hung high upon the rood Of him who gave his life to be our good ; Beyond , priests flitted , bowed , and murmured meet Among the candles shining still and sweet .
Parsing [sent. 3250 len. 32]: Men came and went , and worshipped as they could , And still their dust a woman with her broom , Bowed to her work , kept sweeping to the door .
Parsing [sent. 3251 len. 34]: Then saw I , slow through all the pillared gloom , Across the church a silent figure come ; `` Daughter , '' it said , `` thou sweepest well my floor ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3252 len. 5]: It is the Lord !
Parsing [sent. 3253 len. 8]: I cried ; and saw no more .
Parsing [sent. 3254 len. 43]: I suppose , if one could so stop the throat of the blossom-buried nightingale , that , though he might breathe at will , he could no longer sing , he would drop from his bough , and die of suppressed song .
Parsing [sent. 3255 len. 27]: Perhaps some men so die -- I do not know ; it were better than to live , and to bore their friends with the insuppressible .
Parsing [sent. 3256 len. 55]: But , however this may be , the man who can utter himself to his own joy in any of the forms of human expression -- let him give thanks to God ; and , if he give not his verses to the printer , he will probably have cause to give thanks again .
Parsing [sent. 3257 len. 14]: To the man 's self , the utterance is not the less invaluable .
Parsing [sent. 3258 len. 6]: And so Wingfold found it .
Parsing [sent. 3259 len. 18]: He went out again , and into the churchyard , where he sat down on a stone .
Parsing [sent. 3260 len. 22]: `` How strange , '' he said to himself , `` that out of faith should have sprung that stone church !
Parsing [sent. 3261 len. 21]: A poor little poem now and then is all that stands for mine -- all that shows , that is !
Parsing [sent. 3262 len. 10]: But my heart does sometimes burn , within me .
Parsing [sent. 3263 len. 16]: If only I could be sure they were HIS words that set it burning ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3264 len. 3]: CHAPTER XI .
Parsing [sent. 3265 len. 3]: THE SHEATH .
Parsing [sent. 3266 len. 45]: `` Mr. Wingfold , '' said Polwarth one evening , the usual salutations over , taking what he commonly left to his friend -- the initiative , -- `` I want to tell you something I do n't wish even Rachel to hear . ''
Parsing [sent. 3267 len. 13]: He led the way to his room , and the curate followed .
Parsing [sent. 3268 len. 68]: Seated there , in the shadowy old attic , through the very walls of which the ivy grew , and into which , by the open window in the gable , from the infinite west , blew the evening air , carrying with it the precious scent of honeysuckle , to mingle with that of old books , Polwarth recounted and Wingfold listened to a strange adventure .
Parsing [sent. 3269 len. 16]: The trees hid the sky , and the little human nest was dark around them .
Parsing [sent. 3270 len. 28]: `` I am going to make a confidant of you , Mr. Wingfold , '' said the dwarf , with troubled face , and almost whispered word .
Parsing [sent. 3271 len. 33]: `` You will know how much I have already learned to trust you when I say that what I am about to confide to you plainly involves the secret of another . ''
Parsing [sent. 3272 len. 36]: His large face grew paler as he spoke , and something almost like fear grew in his eyes , but they looked straight into those of the curate , and his voice did not tremble .
Parsing [sent. 3273 len. 35]: `` One night , some weeks ago -- I can , if necessary , make myself certain of the date , -- I was -- no uncommon thing with me -- unable to sleep .
Parsing [sent. 3274 len. 68]: Sometimes , when such is my case , I lie as still and happy as any bird under the wing of its mother ; at other times I must get up and go out , for I take longings for air almost as a drunkard for wine , and that night nothing would serve my poor prisoned soul but more air through the bars of its lungs .
Parsing [sent. 3275 len. 9]: I rose , dressed , and went out .
Parsing [sent. 3276 len. 37]: `` It was a still , warm night , no moon , but plenty of star-light , the wind blowing as now , gentle and sweet and cool -- just the wind my lungs sighed for .
Parsing [sent. 3277 len. 24]: I got into the open park , avoiding the trees , and wandered on and on , without thinking where I was going .
Parsing [sent. 3278 len. 78]: The turf was soft under my feet , the dusk soft to my eyes , and the wind to my soul ; I had breath and room and leisure and silence and loneliness , and everything to make me more than usually happy ; and so I wandered on and on , neither caring nor looking whither I went : so long as the stars remained unclouded , I could find my way back when I pleased .
Parsing [sent. 3279 len. 23]: `` I had been out perhaps an hour , when through the soft air came a cry , apparently from far off .
Parsing [sent. 3280 len. 13]: There was something in the tone that seemed to me unusually frightful .
Parsing [sent. 3281 len. 19]: The bare sound made me shudder before I had time to say to myself it was a cry .
Parsing [sent. 3282 len. 21]: I turned my face in the direction of it , so far as I could judge , and went on .
Parsing [sent. 3283 len. 27]: I can not run , for , if I attempt it , I am in a moment unable even to walk -- from palpitation and choking .
Parsing [sent. 3284 len. 27]: `` I had not gone very far before I found myself approaching the hollow where stands the old house of Glaston , uninhabited for twenty years .
Parsing [sent. 3285 len. 25]: Was it possible , I thought , that the cry came from the house , and had therefore sounded farther off than it was ?
Parsing [sent. 3286 len. 16]: I stood and listened for a moment , but all seemed still as the grave .
Parsing [sent. 3287 len. 16]: I must go in , and see whether anyone was there in want of help .
Parsing [sent. 3288 len. 25]: You may well smile at the idea of my helping anyone , for what could I do if it came to a struggle ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3289 len. 20]: `` On the contrary , '' interrupted Wingfold , `` I was smiling with admiration of your pluck . ''
Parsing [sent. 3290 len. 43]: `` At least , '' resumed Polwarth , `` I have this advantage over some , that I can not be fooled with the fancy that this poor miserable body of mine is worth thinking of beside the smallest suspicion of duty .
Parsing [sent. 3291 len. 8]: What is it but a cracked jug ?
Parsing [sent. 3292 len. 24]: So down the slope I went , got into the garden , and made my way through the tangled bushes to the house .
Parsing [sent. 3293 len. 20]: I knew the place perfectly , for I had often wandered all over it , sometimes spending hours there .
Parsing [sent. 3294 len. 31]: `` Before I reached the door , however , I heard some one behind me in the garden , and instantly stepped into a thicket of gooseberry and currant bushes .
Parsing [sent. 3295 len. 18]: It is sometimes an advantage to be little -- the moment I stepped aside I was hidden .
Parsing [sent. 3296 len. 18]: That same moment the night seemed rent in twain by a most hideous cry from the house .
Parsing [sent. 3297 len. 28]: Ere I could breathe again after it , the tall figure of a woman rushed past me , tearing its way through the bushes towards the door .
Parsing [sent. 3298 len. 20]: I followed instantly , saw her run up the steps , and heard her open and shut the door .
Parsing [sent. 3299 len. 48]: I opened it as quietly as I could , but just as I stepped into the dark hall , came a third fearful cry , through the echoes of which in the empty house I heard the rush of hurried feet and trailing garments on the stair .
Parsing [sent. 3300 len. 37]: As I say I knew the house quite well , but my perturbation had so muddled the idea of it in my brain , that for a few seconds I had to consider how it lay .
Parsing [sent. 3301 len. 46]: The moment I recalled its plan , I made what haste I could , reached the top of the stair , and was hesitating which way to turn , when once more came the fearful cry , and set me trembling from head to foot .
Parsing [sent. 3302 len. 9]: I can not describe the horror of it .
Parsing [sent. 3303 len. 24]: It was as the cry of a soul in torture -- unlike any sound of the human voice I had ever before heard .
Parsing [sent. 3304 len. 23]: I shudder now at the recollection of it as it echoed through the house , clinging to the walls and driven along .
Parsing [sent. 3305 len. 33]: I was hurrying I knew not whither , for I had again lost all notion of the house , when I caught a glimpse of a light shining from under a door .
Parsing [sent. 3306 len. 21]: I approached it softly , and finding that door inside a small closet , knew at once where I was .
Parsing [sent. 3307 len. 48]: As I was in office on the ground , and it could hardly be any thing righteous that led to such an outcry in the house , which , although deserted , was still my master 's , I felt justified in searching further into the matter .
Parsing [sent. 3308 len. 18]: Laying my ear therefore against the door , I heard what was plainly a lady 's voice .
Parsing [sent. 3309 len. 22]: Right sweet and womanly it was , though full of pain -- even agony , I thought , but heroically suppressed .
Parsing [sent. 3310 len. 12]: She soothed , she expostulated , she condoled , she coaxed .
Parsing [sent. 3311 len. 14]: Mingled with hers was the voice of a youth , as it seemed .
Parsing [sent. 3312 len. 25]: It was wild , yet so low as sometimes to be all but inaudible , and not a word from either could I distinguish .
Parsing [sent. 3313 len. 34]: Hardly the less plain was it , however , that the youth spoke either in delirium or with something terrible on his mind , for his tones were those of one in despair .
Parsing [sent. 3314 len. 11]: I stood for a time bewildered , fascinated , terrified .
Parsing [sent. 3315 len. 15]: At length I grew convinced somehow that I had no right to be there .
Parsing [sent. 3316 len. 25]: Doubtless the man was in hiding , and where a man hides there must he reason , but was it any business of mine ?
Parsing [sent. 3317 len. 14]: I crept out of the house , and up to the higher ground .
Parsing [sent. 3318 len. 28]: There I drew deep breaths of the sweet night air -- so pure that it seemed to be washing the world clean for another day 's uses .
Parsing [sent. 3319 len. 11]: But I had no longer any pleasure in the world .
Parsing [sent. 3320 len. 26]: I went straight home , and to bed again -- but had brought little repose with me : I must do something -- but what ?
Parsing [sent. 3321 len. 15]: The only result certain to follow , was more trouble to the troubled already .
Parsing [sent. 3322 len. 11]: Might there not be innocent reasons for the questionable situation ?
Parsing [sent. 3323 len. 21]: -- Might not the man have been taken ill , and so suddenly that he could reach no other shelter ?
Parsing [sent. 3324 len. 26]: And the lady might be his wife , who had gone as soon as she could leave him to find help , but had failed .
Parsing [sent. 3325 len. 15]: There MUST be some simple explanation of the matter , however strange it showed !
Parsing [sent. 3326 len. 13]: I might , in the morning , be of service to them .
Parsing [sent. 3327 len. 15]: And partly comforted by the temporary conclusion , I got a little troubled sleep .
Parsing [sent. 3328 len. 20]: `` As soon as I had had a cup of tea , I set out for the old house .
Parsing [sent. 3329 len. 17]: I heard the sounds of the workmen 's hammers on the new one as I went .
Parsing [sent. 3330 len. 5]: All else was silence .
Parsing [sent. 3331 len. 25]: The day looked so honest and so clear of conscience that it was difficult to believe the night had shrouded such an awful meeting .
Parsing [sent. 3332 len. 32]: Yet , in the broad light of the forenoon , a cold shudder seized me when first I looked down on the slack ridges and broken roofs of the old house .
Parsing [sent. 3333 len. 38]: When I got into the garden I began to sing and knock the bushes about , then opened the door noisily , and clattered about in the hall and the lower rooms before going up the stair .
Parsing [sent. 3334 len. 26]: Along every passage and into every room I went , to give good warning ere I approached that in which I had heard the voices .
Parsing [sent. 3335 len. 12]: At length I stood at the door of it and knocked .
Parsing [sent. 3336 len. 5]: There was no answer .
Parsing [sent. 3337 len. 4]: I knocked again .
Parsing [sent. 3338 len. 4]: Still no answer .
Parsing [sent. 3339 len. 7]: I opened it and peeped in .
Parsing [sent. 3340 len. 6]: There was no one there !
Parsing [sent. 3341 len. 8]: An old bedstead was all I saw .
Parsing [sent. 3342 len. 52]: I searched every corner , but not one trace could I discover of human being having been there , except this behind the bed -- and it may have lain there as long as the mattress , which I remember since the first time I ever went into the house . ''
Parsing [sent. 3343 len. 44]: As he spoke Polwarth handed to the curate a small leather sheath , which , from its shape , could not have belonged to a pair of scissors , although neither of the men knew any sort of knife it would have fitted .
Parsing [sent. 3344 len. 13]: `` Would you mind taking care of it , Mr. Wingfold ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3345 len. 17]: the gate-keeper continued as the curate examined it ; `` I do n't like having it .
Parsing [sent. 3346 len. 26]: I ca n't even bear to think of it even in the house , and yet I do n't quite care to destroy it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3347 len. 17]: `` I do n't in the least mind taking charge of it , '' answered Wingfold .
Parsing [sent. 3348 len. 55]: Why was it that , as he said so , the face of Helen Lingard rose before his mind 's eye as he had now seen it twice in the congregation at the Abbey -- pale with an inward trouble as it seemed , large-eyed and worn -- so changed , yet so ennobled ?
Parsing [sent. 3349 len. 46]: Even then he had felt the deadening effect of its listlessness , and had had to turn away lest it should compel him to feel that he was but talking to the winds , or into a desert where dwelt no voice of human response .
Parsing [sent. 3350 len. 8]: Why should he think of her now ?
Parsing [sent. 3351 len. 35]: Was it that her troubled pallid face had touched him -- had set something near his heart a trembling , whether with merely human sympathy or with the tenderness of man for suffering woman ?
Parsing [sent. 3352 len. 24]: Certainly he had never till then thought of her with the slightest interest , and why should she come up to him now ?
Parsing [sent. 3353 len. 6]: Could it be that -- ?
Parsing [sent. 3354 len. 3]: Good heavens !
Parsing [sent. 3355 len. 6]: There was her brother ill !
Parsing [sent. 3356 len. 16]: And had not Faber said there seemed something unusual about the character of his illness ?
Parsing [sent. 3357 len. 6]: -- What could it mean ?
Parsing [sent. 3358 len. 37]: -- It was impossible of course -- but yet -- and yet -- `` Do you think , '' he said , `` we are in any way bound to inquire further into the affair ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3359 len. 21]: `` If I had thought so , I should not have left it unmentioned till now , '' answered Polwarth .
Parsing [sent. 3360 len. 28]: `` But without being busybodies , we might be prepared in case the thing should unfold itself , and put it in our power to be useful .
Parsing [sent. 3361 len. 10]: Meantime I have the relief of the confessional . ''
Parsing [sent. 3362 len. 3]: CHAPTER XII .
Parsing [sent. 3363 len. 2]: INVITATION .
Parsing [sent. 3364 len. 23]: As Wingfold walked back to his lodgings , he found a new element mingling with the varied matter of his previous inquiry .
Parsing [sent. 3365 len. 60]: Human suffering laid hold upon him -- neither as his own nor as that of humanity , but as that of men and women -- known or unknown , it mattered nothing : there were hearts in the world from whose agony broke terrible cries , hearts of which sad faces like that of Miss Lingard were the exponents .
Parsing [sent. 3366 len. 41]: Such hearts might be groaning and writhing in any of the houses he passed , and , even if he knew the hearts , and what the vampire that sucked their blood , he could do nothing for their relief .
Parsing [sent. 3367 len. 42]: Little indeed could he have imagined the life of such a comfort-guarded lady as Miss Lingard , exposed to the intrusion of any terror-waking monster , from the old ocean of chaos , into the quiet flow of its meadow-banked river !
Parsing [sent. 3368 len. 60]: And what multitudes must there not be in the world -- what multitudes in our island -- how many even in Glaston , whose hearts , lacerated by no remorse , overwhelmed by no crushing sense of guilt , yet knew their own bitterness , and had no friend radiant enough to make a sunshine in their shady places !
Parsing [sent. 3369 len. 12]: He fell into mournful mood over the troubles of his race .
Parsing [sent. 3370 len. 49]: Always a kind-hearted fellow , he had not been used to think about such things ; he had had troubles of his own , and had got through at least some of them ; people must have troubles , else would they grow unendurable for pride and insolence .
Parsing [sent. 3371 len. 58]: But now that he had begun to hope he saw a glimmer somewhere afar at the end of the darksome cave in which he had all at once discovered that he was buried alive , he began also to feel how wretched those must be who were groping on without even a hope in their dark eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3372 len. 66]: If he had never committed any crime , he had yet done wrong enough to understand the misery of shame and dishonour , and should he not find a loving human heart the heart of the world , would rejoice -- with what rejoicing might then be possible -- to accept George Bascombe 's theory , and drop into the jaws of darkness and cease .
Parsing [sent. 3373 len. 22]: How much more miserable then must those be who had committed some terrible crime , or dearly loved one who had !
Parsing [sent. 3374 len. 11]: What relief , what hope , what lightening for them !
Parsing [sent. 3375 len. 16]: What a breeding nest of vermiculate cares and pains was this human heart of ours !
Parsing [sent. 3376 len. 8]: Oh , surely it needed some refuge !
Parsing [sent. 3377 len. 21]: If no saviour had yet come , the tortured world of human hearts cried aloud for one with unutterable groaning !
Parsing [sent. 3378 len. 11]: What would Bascombe do if he had committed a murder ?
Parsing [sent. 3379 len. 10]: Or what could he do for one who had ?
Parsing [sent. 3380 len. 40]: If fable it were , it was at least a need -- invented one -- that of a Saviour to whom anyone might go , at any moment , without a journey , without letters or commendations or credentials !
Parsing [sent. 3381 len. 33]: And yet no : if it had been invented , it could hardly be by any one in the need , for such even now could hardly be brought to believe it .
Parsing [sent. 3382 len. 19]: Ill bested were the world indeed if there were no one beyond whose pardon crime could not go !
Parsing [sent. 3383 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 3384 len. 15]: but where was the good of pardon if still the conscious crime kept stinging ?
Parsing [sent. 3385 len. 17]: and who would wish one he loved to grow callous to the crime he had committed ?
Parsing [sent. 3386 len. 25]: Could one rejoice that his guilty friend had learned to laugh again , able at length to banish the memory of the foul thing ?
Parsing [sent. 3387 len. 25]: Would reviving self-content render him pleasant to the eyes , and his company precious in the wisdom that springs from the knowledge of evil ?
Parsing [sent. 3388 len. 32]: Would not that be the moment when he who had most assiduously sought to comfort him in his remorse , would first be tempted to withdraw his foot from his threshold ?
Parsing [sent. 3389 len. 127]: But if there was a God -- such a God as , according to the Christian story , had sent his own son into the world -- had given him to appear among us , clothed in the garb of humanity , the armour that can be pierced , to take all the consequences of being the god of obedience amongst the children of disobedience , engulfing their wrongs in his infinite forbearance , and winning them back , by slow and unpromising and tedious renewal , to the heart of his father , surely such a God would not have created them , knowing that some of them would sin sins from the horror of which in themselves all his devotion could not redeem them !
Parsing [sent. 3390 len. 35]: -- And as he thought thus , the words arose in his mind -- `` COME UNTO ME ALL YE THAT LABOUR AND ARE HEAVY LADEN , AND I WILL GIVE YOU REST . ''
Parsing [sent. 3391 len. 4]: His heart filled .
Parsing [sent. 3392 len. 5]: He pondered over them .
Parsing [sent. 3393 len. 13]: When he got home he sought and found them in the book .
Parsing [sent. 3394 len. 9]: -- Did a man ever really utter them ?
Parsing [sent. 3395 len. 22]: If a man did , either he was the most presumptuous of mortals , or HE COULD DO WHAT HE SAID .
Parsing [sent. 3396 len. 35]: If he could , then to have seen and distrusted that man , Wingfold felt , would have been to destroy in himself the believing faculty and become incapable of trusting for ever after .
Parsing [sent. 3397 len. 55]: And such a man must , in virtue of his very innocence , know that the worst weariness and the worst load is evil and crime , and must know himself able , in full righteousness , with no jugglery of oblivion or self-esteem , to take off the heavy load and give rest .
Parsing [sent. 3398 len. 38]: `` And yet , '' thought the curate , not without self-reproach , `` for one who will go to him to get the rest , a thousand will ask -- HOW CAN HE THEN DO IT ?
Parsing [sent. 3399 len. 11]: -- As if they should be fit to know ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3400 len. 3]: CHAPTER XIII .
Parsing [sent. 3401 len. 5]: A SERMON TO HELEN .
Parsing [sent. 3402 len. 45]: All the rest of the week his mind was full of thoughts like these , amid which ever arose the suffering face of Helen Lingard , bringing with it the still strengthening suspicion that behind it must lie some oppressive , perhaps terrible secret .
Parsing [sent. 3403 len. 26]: But he made no slightest movement towards the discovery of it , put not a single question in any direction for its confirmation or dissolution .
Parsing [sent. 3404 len. 35]: He would not look in at her windows , but what seeds of comfort he could find , he would scatter wide , and hope that some of them might fall into her garden .
Parsing [sent. 3405 len. 146]: When he raised his head on the Sunday from kneeling , with heart honest , devout , and neighbourly , in the pulpit before the sermon , and cast his eyes round his congregation , they rested first , for one moment and no more , upon the same pallid and troubled countenance whose reflection had so often of late looked out from the magic mirror of his memory ; the next , they flitted across the satisfied , healthy , handsome , clever face of her cousin , behind which plainly sat a conscience well-to-do , in an easy chair ; the third , they saw and fled the peevish autumnal visage of Mrs. Ramshorn ; the next , they roved a little , then rested on the draper 's good-humoured disc , on the white forehead of which brooded a cloud of thoughtfulness .
Parsing [sent. 3406 len. 18]: Last of all they sought the free seats , and found the faces of both the dwarfs .
Parsing [sent. 3407 len. 29]: It was the first time he had seen Rachel 's there , and it struck him that it expressed greater suffering than he had read in it before .
Parsing [sent. 3408 len. 14]: She ought rather to be in bed than in church , he thought .
Parsing [sent. 3409 len. 58]: But the same seemed the case with her uncle 's countenance also ; and with that came the conclusion that the pulpit was a wonderful watch-tower whence to study human nature ; that people lay bare more of their real nature and condition to the man in the pulpit than they know -- even before the sermon .
Parsing [sent. 3410 len. 34]: Their faces have fallen into the shape of their minds , for the church has an isolating as well as congregating power , and no passing emotion moulds them to an evanescent show .
Parsing [sent. 3411 len. 33]: When Polwarth spoke to a friend , the suffering melted in issuing radiance ; when he sat thus quiescent , patient endurance was the first thing to be read on his countenance .
Parsing [sent. 3412 len. 48]: This flashed through the curate 's mind in the moments ere he began to speak , and with it came afresh the feeling -- one that is , yet ought not to be sad -- that no one of all these hearts could give summer-weather to another .
Parsing [sent. 3413 len. 37]: The tears rose in his eyes as he gazed , and his heart swelled towards his own flesh and blood , as if his spirit would break forth in a torrent of ministering tenderness and comfort .
Parsing [sent. 3414 len. 12]: Then he made haste to speak lest he should become unable .
Parsing [sent. 3415 len. 18]: As usual his voice trembled at first , but rose into strength as his earnestness found way .
Parsing [sent. 3416 len. 50]: This is a good deal like what he said : `` The marvellous man who is reported to have appeared in Palestine , teaching and preaching , seems to have suffered far more from sympathy with the inward sorrows of his race than from pity for their bodily pains .
Parsing [sent. 3417 len. 15]: These last , could he not have swept from the earth with a word ?
Parsing [sent. 3418 len. 44]: and yet it seems to have been mostly , if not indeed always , only in answer to prayer that he healed them , and that for the sake of some deeper , some spiritual healing that should go with the bodily cure .
Parsing [sent. 3419 len. 23]: It could not be for the dead man whom he was about to call from the tomb , that his tears flowed .
Parsing [sent. 3420 len. 86]: What source could they have but compassion and pitiful sympathy for the sorrows of the dead man 's sisters and friends who had not the inward joy that sustained himself , and the thought of all the pains and heartaches of those that looked in the face of death -- the meanings of love -- torn generations , the blackness of bereavement that had stormed through the ever changing world of human hearts since first man had been made in the image of his Father ?
Parsing [sent. 3421 len. 22]: Yet are there far more terrible troubles than this death -- which I trust can only part , not keep apart .
Parsing [sent. 3422 len. 30]: There is the weight of conscious wrong being and wrong doing -- that is the gravestone that needs to be rolled away ere a man can rise to life .
Parsing [sent. 3423 len. 26]: Call to mind how Jesus used to forgive men 's sins , thus lifting from their hearts the crushing load that paralyzed all their efforts .
Parsing [sent. 3424 len. 40]: Recall the tenderness with which he received those from whom the religious of his day turned aside -- the repentant women who wept sore-hearted from very love , the publicans who knew they were despised because they were despicable .
Parsing [sent. 3425 len. 8]: With him they sought and found shelter .
Parsing [sent. 3426 len. 35]: He was their saviour from the storm of human judgment and the biting frost of public opinion , even when that opinion and that judgment were re-echoed by the justice of their own hearts .
Parsing [sent. 3427 len. 30]: He received them , and the life within them rose up , and the light shone -- the conscious light of light , despite even of shame and self-reproach .
Parsing [sent. 3428 len. 11]: If God be for us who can be against us ?
Parsing [sent. 3429 len. 27]: In his name they rose from the hell of their own hearts ' condemnation , and went forth to do the truth in strength and hope .
Parsing [sent. 3430 len. 9]: They heard and believed and obeyed his words .
Parsing [sent. 3431 len. 71]: And of all words that ever were spoken , were ever words gentler , tenderer , humbler , lovelier -- if true , or more arrogant , man-degrading , God-defying -- if false , than these , concerning which , as his , I now desire to speak to you : ` Come unto me , all ye that labour and are heavy-laden , and I will give you rest .
Parsing [sent. 3432 len. 29]: Take my yoke upon you , and learn of me ; for I am meek and lowly in heart : and ye shall find rest unto your souls .
Parsing [sent. 3433 len. 13]: For my yoke is easy , and my burden is light ' ?
Parsing [sent. 3434 len. 22]: `` Surely these words , could they but be heartily believed , are such as every human heart might gladly hear !
Parsing [sent. 3435 len. 26]: What man is there who has not had , has not now , or will not have to class himself amongst the weary and heavy-laden ?
Parsing [sent. 3436 len. 57]: Ye who call yourselves Christians profess to believe such rest is to be had , yet how many of you go bowed to the very earth , and take no single step towards him who says Come , lift not an eye to see whether a face of mercy may not be looking down upon you !
Parsing [sent. 3437 len. 22]: Is it that , after all , you do not believe there ever was such a man as they call Jesus ?
Parsing [sent. 3438 len. 5]: That can hardly be .
Parsing [sent. 3439 len. 32]: There are few so ignorant , or so wilfully illogical as to be able to disbelieve in the existence of the man , or that he spoke words to this effect .
Parsing [sent. 3440 len. 15]: Is it then that you are doubtful concerning the whole import of his appearance ?
Parsing [sent. 3441 len. 26]: In that case , were it but as a doubtful medicine , would it not be well to make some trial of the offer made ?
Parsing [sent. 3442 len. 19]: If the man said the words , he must have at least believed that he could fulfil them .
Parsing [sent. 3443 len. 23]: Who that knows anything of him at all can for a moment hold that this man spoke what he did not believe ?
Parsing [sent. 3444 len. 25]: The best of the Jews who yet do not believe in him , say of him that he was a good though mistaken man .
Parsing [sent. 3445 len. 24]: Will a man lie for the privilege of being despised and rejected of men , a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief ?
Parsing [sent. 3446 len. 35]: What but the confidence of truth could have sustained him when he knew that even those who loved him would have left him had they believed what he told them of his coming fate ?
Parsing [sent. 3447 len. 16]: -- But then : believing what he said , might he not have been mistaken ?
Parsing [sent. 3448 len. 27]: -- A man can hardly be mistaken as to whether he is at peace or not -- whether he has rest in his soul or not .
Parsing [sent. 3449 len. 29]: Neither I think can a man well be mistaken as to whence comes the peace he possesses , -- as to the well whence he draws his comfort .
Parsing [sent. 3450 len. 9]: The miser knows his comfort is his gold .
Parsing [sent. 3451 len. 20]: Was Jesus likely to be mistaken when he supposed himself to know that his comfort came from his God ?
Parsing [sent. 3452 len. 21]: Anyhow he believed that his peace came from his obedience -- from his oneness with the will of his Father .
Parsing [sent. 3453 len. 21]: Friends , if I had such peace as was plainly his , should I not know well whence it came ?
Parsing [sent. 3454 len. 38]: -- But I think I hear some one say : ` Doubtless the good man derived comfort from the thought of his Father , but might he not be mistaken in supposing there was any Father ? '
Parsing [sent. 3455 len. 17]: Hear me , my friends : I dare not say I know there is a Father .
Parsing [sent. 3456 len. 33]: I dare not even say I think , I can only say with my whole heart I hope we have indeed a Father in heaven ; but this man says HE KNOWS .
Parsing [sent. 3457 len. 9]: Am I to say he does not know ?
Parsing [sent. 3458 len. 23]: Can I , who know so much I would gladly have otherwise in myself , imagine him less honest than I am ?
Parsing [sent. 3459 len. 13]: If he tells me he knows , I am dumb and listen .
Parsing [sent. 3460 len. 24]: One I KNOW : THERE IS -- outweighs a whole creation of voices crying each I KNOW NOT , THEREFORE THERE IS NOT .
Parsing [sent. 3461 len. 37]: And observe it is his own , his own best he wants to give them -- no bribe to obedience to his will , but the assurance of bliss if they will do as he does .
Parsing [sent. 3462 len. 20]: He wants them to have peace -- HIS peace -- peace from the same source whence he has it .
Parsing [sent. 3463 len. 17]: For what does he mean by TAKE MY YOKE UPON YOU , AND LEARN OF ME ?
Parsing [sent. 3464 len. 17]: He does not mean WEAR THE YOKE I LAY UPON YOU , AND OBEY MY WORDS .
Parsing [sent. 3465 len. 48]: I do not say he might not have said so , or that he does not say what comes to the same thing at other times , but that is not what he says here -- that is not the truth he would convey in these words .
Parsing [sent. 3466 len. 58]: He means TAKE UPON YOU THE YOKE I WEAR ; LEARN TO DO AS I DO , WHO SUBMIT EVERYTHING AND REFER EVERYTHING TO THE WILL OF MY FATHER , YEA HAVE MY WILL ONLY IN THE CARRYING OUT OF HIS : BE MEEK AND LOWLY IN HEART , AND YE SHALL FIND REST UNTO YOUR SOULS .
Parsing [sent. 3467 len. 43]: With all the grief of humanity in his heart , in the face of the death that awaited him , he yet says , FOR MY YOKE , THE YOKE I WEAR , IS EASY , THE BURDEN I BEAR IS LIGHT .
Parsing [sent. 3468 len. 11]: What made that yoke easy , -- that burden light ?
Parsing [sent. 3469 len. 9]: That it was the will of the Father .
Parsing [sent. 3470 len. 64]: If a man answer : ` Any good man who believed in a God , might say as much , and I do not see how it can help me ; ' my reply is , that this man says , COME UNTO ME , AND I WILL GIVE YOU REST -- asserting the power to give perfect help to him that comes .
Parsing [sent. 3471 len. 19]: -- Does all this look far away , my friends , and very unlike the things about us ?
Parsing [sent. 3472 len. 20]: The things about you do not give you peace ; from something different you may hope to gain it .
Parsing [sent. 3473 len. 24]: And do not our souls themselves fall out with their surroundings , and cry for a nobler , better , more beautiful life ?
Parsing [sent. 3474 len. 48]: `` But some one will perhaps say : ` It is well ; but were I meek and lowly in heart as he of whom you speak , it could not touch MY trouble : that springs not from myself , but from one I love . '
Parsing [sent. 3475 len. 24]: I answer , if the peace be the peace of the Son of man , it must reach to every cause of unrest .
Parsing [sent. 3476 len. 17]: And if thou hadst it , would it not then be next door to thy friend ?
Parsing [sent. 3477 len. 19]: How shall he whom thou lovest receive it the most readily -- but through thee who lovest him ?
Parsing [sent. 3478 len. 12]: What if thy faith should be the next step to his ?
Parsing [sent. 3479 len. 74]: Anyhow , if this peace be not an all-reaching as well as a heart-filling peace ; if it be not a righteous and a lovely peace , and that in despite of all surrounding and opposing troubles , then it is not the peace of God , for that passeth all understanding : -- so at least say they who profess to know , and I desire to take them at their word .
Parsing [sent. 3480 len. 52]: If thy trouble be a trouble thy God can not set right , then either thy God is not the true God , or there is no true God , and the man who professed to reveal him led the one perfect life in virtue of his faith in a falsehood .
Parsing [sent. 3481 len. 11]: Alas for poor men and women and their aching hearts !
Parsing [sent. 3482 len. 89]: -- If it offend any of you that I speak of Jesus as THE MAN who professed to reveal God , I answer , that the man I see , and he draws me as with the strength of the adorable Truth ; but if in him I should certainly find the God for the lack of whose peace I and my brethren and sisters pine , then were heaven itself too narrow to hold my exultation , for in God himself alone could my joy find room .
Parsing [sent. 3483 len. 17]: `` Come then , sore heart , and see whether his heart can not heal thine .
Parsing [sent. 3484 len. 45]: He knows what sighs and tears are , and if he knew no sin in himself , the more pitiful must it have been to him to behold the sighs and tears that guilt wrung from the tortured hearts of his brethren and sisters .
Parsing [sent. 3485 len. 14]: Brothers , sisters , we MUST get rid of this misery of ours .
Parsing [sent. 3486 len. 5]: It is slaying us .
Parsing [sent. 3487 len. 17]: It is turning the fair earth into a hell , and our hearts into its fuel .
Parsing [sent. 3488 len. 16]: There stands the man , who says he knows : take him at his word .
Parsing [sent. 3489 len. 36]: Go to him who says in the might of his eternal tenderness and his human pity -- COME UNTO ME , ALL YE THAT LABOUR AND ARE HEAVY-LADEN , AND I WILL GIVE YOU REST .
Parsing [sent. 3490 len. 29]: TAKE MY YOKE UPON YOU , AND LEARN OF ME ; FOR I AM MEEK AND LOWLY IN HEART : AND YE SHALL FIND REST UNTO YOUR SOULS .
Parsing [sent. 3491 len. 12]: FOR MY YOKE IS EASY AND MY BURDEN IS LIGHT . ''
Parsing [sent. 3492 len. 3]: CHAPTER XIV .
Parsing [sent. 3493 len. 5]: A SERMON TO HIMSELF .
Parsing [sent. 3494 len. 50]: Long ere he thus came to a close , Wingfold was blind to all and every individuality before him -- felt only the general suffering of the human soul , and the new-born hope for it that lay in the story of the ideal man , the human God .
Parsing [sent. 3495 len. 14]: He did not see that Helen 's head was down on the book-board .
Parsing [sent. 3496 len. 5]: She was sobbing convulsively .
Parsing [sent. 3497 len. 22]: In some way the word had touched her , and had unsealed the fountain of tears , if not of faith .
Parsing [sent. 3498 len. 33]: Neither did he see the curl on the lip of Bascombe , or the glance of annoyance which , every now and then , he cast upon the bent head beside him .
Parsing [sent. 3499 len. 9]: `` What on earth are you crying about ?
Parsing [sent. 3500 len. 26]: It is all in the way of his business , you know , '' said Bascombe 's eyes , but Helen did not hear them .
Parsing [sent. 3501 len. 27]: One or two more in the congregation were weeping , and here and there shone a face in which the light seemed to prevent the tears .
Parsing [sent. 3502 len. 6]: Polwarth shone and Rachel wept .
Parsing [sent. 3503 len. 16]: For the rest , the congregation listened only with varying degrees of attention and indifference .
Parsing [sent. 3504 len. 22]: The larger portion looked as if neither Wingfold nor any other body ever meant anything -- at least in the pulpit .
Parsing [sent. 3505 len. 32]: The moment Wingfold reached the vestry , he hurried off the garments of his profession , sped from the Abbey , and all but ran across the church-yard to his lodging .
Parsing [sent. 3506 len. 66]: There he shut himself up in his chamber , fearful lest he should have said more than he had yet a right to say , and lest ebbing emotion should uncover the fact that he had been but `` fired by the running of his own wheels , '' and not inspired by the guide of `` the fiery-wheeled throne , the cherub Contemplation . ''
Parsing [sent. 3507 len. 30]: There , from the congregation , from the church , from the sermon , from the past altogether , he turned aside his face and would forget them quite .
Parsing [sent. 3508 len. 30]: What had he to do with the thing that was done , -- done with , and gone , either into the treasury or the lumber-room , of creation ?
Parsing [sent. 3509 len. 28]: Towards the hills of help he turned his face -- to the summits over whose tops he looked for the dayspring from on high to break forth .
Parsing [sent. 3510 len. 8]: If only Christ would come to him !
Parsing [sent. 3511 len. 81]: -- Do what he might , however , his thoughts WOULD wander back to the great gothic gulf into which he had been pouring out his soul , and the greater human gulfs that opened into the ancient pile , whose mouths were the faces that hid the floor beneath them -- until at length he was altogether vexed with himself for being interested in what he had done , instead of absorbed in what he had yet to do .
Parsing [sent. 3512 len. 26]: He left therefore his chamber , and placed himself at a side-table in his sitting-room , while his landlady prepared the other for his dinner .
Parsing [sent. 3513 len. 72]: She too had been at church that morning , whence it came that she moved about and set the things on the table with unusual softness , causing him no interruption while he wrote down a line here and there of what afterwards grew into the following verses -- born in the effort to forget the things that were behind , and reach forth after the things that lay before him .
Parsing [sent. 3514 len. 21]: Yes , Master , when thou comest thou shalt find A little faith on earth , if I am here !
Parsing [sent. 3515 len. 22]: Thou know ` st how oft I turn to thee my mind , How sad I wait until thy face appear !
Parsing [sent. 3516 len. 19]: Hast thou not ploughed my thorny ground full sore , And from it gathered many stones and sherds ?
Parsing [sent. 3517 len. 21]: Plough , plough and harrow till it needs no more -- Then sow thy mustard-seed , and send thy birds .
Parsing [sent. 3518 len. 43]: I love thee , Lord ; and if I yield to fears , Nor trust with triumph that pale doubt defies , Remember , Lord , 't is nigh two thousand years , And I have never seen thee with mine eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3519 len. 21]: And when I lift them from the wondrous tale , See , all about me has so strange a show !
Parsing [sent. 3520 len. 9]: Is that thy river running down the vale ?
Parsing [sent. 3521 len. 11]: Is that thy wind that through the pines doth blow ?
Parsing [sent. 3522 len. 37]: Couldst thou right verily appear again , The same who walked the paths of Palestine , And here in England teach thy trusting men , In church and field and house , with word and sign ?
Parsing [sent. 3523 len. 11]: Here are but lilies , sparrows , and the rest !
Parsing [sent. 3524 len. 12]: -- My hands on some dear proof would light and stay !
Parsing [sent. 3525 len. 21]: But my heart sees John leaning on thy breast , And sends them forth to do what thou dost say .
Parsing [sent. 3526 len. 3]: CHAPTER XV .
Parsing [sent. 3527 len. 2]: CRITICISM .
Parsing [sent. 3528 len. 6]: `` Extraordinary young man ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3529 len. 16]: exclaimed Mrs. Ramshorn as they left the church , with a sigh that expressed despair .
Parsing [sent. 3530 len. 9]: `` Is he an infidel or a fanatic ?
Parsing [sent. 3531 len. 7]: a Jesuit or a Socinian ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3532 len. 30]: `` If he would pay a little more attention to his composition , '' said Bascombe indifferently , `` he might in time make of himself a good speaker .
Parsing [sent. 3533 len. 49]: I am not at all sure there are not the elements of an orator in him , if he would only reflect a little on the fine relations between speech and passion , and learn of the best models how to play upon the feelings of a congregation .
Parsing [sent. 3534 len. 17]: I declare I do n't know , but he might make a great man of himself .
Parsing [sent. 3535 len. 44]: As long as he do n't finish his sentences however , jumbles his figures , and begins and ends abruptly without either exordium or peroration , he need n't look to make anything of a preacher -- and that seems his object . ''
Parsing [sent. 3536 len. 16]: `` If that be his object , he had better join the Methodists at once .
Parsing [sent. 3537 len. 13]: He would be a treasure to them , '' said Mrs. Ramshorn .
Parsing [sent. 3538 len. 9]: `` That is not his object , George .
Parsing [sent. 3539 len. 7]: How can you say so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3540 len. 10]: remarked Helen quietly , but with some latent indignation .
Parsing [sent. 3541 len. 11]: George smiled a rather unpleasant smile and held his peace .
Parsing [sent. 3542 len. 9]: Little more was said on the way home .
Parsing [sent. 3543 len. 22]: Helen went to take off her bonnet , but did not re-appear until she was called to their early Sunday dinner .
Parsing [sent. 3544 len. 70]: Now George had counted upon a turn in the garden with her before dinner , and was annoyed -- more , it is true , because of the emotion which he rightly judged the cause of her not joining him , than the necessity laid on him of eating his dinner without having first unburdened his mind ; but the latter fact also had its share in vexing him .
Parsing [sent. 3545 len. 61]: When she came into the drawing-room it was plain she had been weeping ; but , although they were alone , and would probably have to wait yet a few minutes before their aunt joined them , he resolved in his good nature to be considerate , and say nothing till after dinner , lest he should spoil her appetite .
Parsing [sent. 3546 len. 43]: When they rose from the table , she would have again escaped , but when George left his wine and followed her , she consented , at his urgent , almost expostulatory request , to walk once round the garden with him .
Parsing [sent. 3547 len. 28]: As soon as they were out of sight of the windows , he began -- in the tone of one whose love it is that prompts rebuke .
Parsing [sent. 3548 len. 49]: `` How COULD you , my dear Helen , have so little care of your health , already so much shaken with nursing your brother , as to yield your mind to the maundering of that silly ecclesiastic , and allow his false eloquence to untune your nerves !
Parsing [sent. 3549 len. 29]: Remember your health is the first thing -- positively the FIRST and foremost thing to be considered , both for your own sake and that of your friends .
Parsing [sent. 3550 len. 9]: Without health , what is anything worth ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3551 len. 33]: Helen made no answer , but she thought with herself there were two or three things for the sake of which she would willingly part with a considerable portion of her health .
Parsing [sent. 3552 len. 13]: Her cousin imagined her conscience-stricken , and resumed with yet greater confidence .
Parsing [sent. 3553 len. 101]: `` If you MUST go to church , you ought to prepare yourself beforehand by firmly impressing on your mind the fact that the whole thing is but part of a system -- part of a false system ; that the preacher has been brought up to the trade of religion , that it is his business , and that he must lay himself out to persuade people -- himself first of all if he can , but anyhow his congregation , of the truth of everything contained in that farrago of priestly absurdities -- called the Bible , forsooth !
Parsing [sent. 3554 len. 14]: as if there were no other book worthy to be mentioned beside it .
Parsing [sent. 3555 len. 54]: Think for a moment how soon , were it not for their churches and prayers and music and their tomfoolery of preaching , the whole precious edifice would topple about their ears , and the livelihood , the means of contentment and influence , would be gone from so many restless paltering spirits !
Parsing [sent. 3556 len. 23]: So what is left them but to play upon the hopes and fears and diseased consciences of men as they best can !
Parsing [sent. 3557 len. 3]: The idiot !
Parsing [sent. 3558 len. 13]: To tell a man when he is hipped to COME UNTO ME !
Parsing [sent. 3559 len. 2]: Bah !
Parsing [sent. 3560 len. 92]: Does the fool really expect any grown man or woman to believe in his or her brain that the man who spoke those words , if ever there was a man who spoke them , can at this moment anni domini '' -- George liked to be correct -- `` 1870 , hear whatever silly words the Rev. Mr. Wingfold , or any other human biped , may think proper to address to him with his face buried in his blankets by his bedside or in his surplice over the pulpit-bible ?
Parsing [sent. 3561 len. 38]: -- not to mention that they would have you believe , or be damned to all eternity , that every thought vibrated in the convolutions of your brain is known to him as well as to yourself !
Parsing [sent. 3562 len. 7]: The thing is really too absurd !
Parsing [sent. 3563 len. 2]: Ha !
Parsing [sent. 3564 len. 2]: ha !
Parsing [sent. 3565 len. 2]: ha !
Parsing [sent. 3566 len. 41]: The man died -- the death of a malefactor , they say ; and his body was stolen from his grave by his followers , that they might impose thousands of years of absurdity upon generations to come after them .
Parsing [sent. 3567 len. 43]: And now , when a fellow feels miserable , he is to cry to that dead man , who said of himself that he was meek and lowly in heart , and straightway the poor beggar shall find rest to his soul !
Parsing [sent. 3568 len. 22]: All I can say is that , if he find rest so , it will be the rest of an idiot !
Parsing [sent. 3569 len. 37]: Believe me , Helen , a good Havannah and a bottle of claret would be considerably more to the purpose ; -- for ladies , perhaps rather a cup of tea and a little Beethoven ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3570 len. 17]: Here he laughed , for the rush of his eloquence had swept away his bad humour .
Parsing [sent. 3571 len. 19]: `` But really , '' he went on , `` the whole is TOO absurd to talk about .
Parsing [sent. 3572 len. 14]: To go whining after an old Jew fable in these days of progress !
Parsing [sent. 3573 len. 14]: Why , what do you think is the last discovery about light ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3574 len. 57]: `` You will allow this much in excuse for their being so misled , '' returned Helen , with some bitterness , `` that the old fable pretends at least to provide help for sore hearts ; and except it be vivisection , I -- '' `` Do be serious , Helen , '' interrupted George .
Parsing [sent. 3575 len. 21]: `` I do n't object to joking , you know , but you are not joking in a right spirit .
Parsing [sent. 3576 len. 48]: This matter has to do with the well-being of the race ; and we MUST think of others , however your Jew-gospel , in the genuine spirit of the Hebrew of all time , would set everybody to the saving of his own wind-bubble of a soul .
Parsing [sent. 3577 len. 21]: Believe me , to live for others is the true way to lose sight of our own fancied sorrows . ''
Parsing [sent. 3578 len. 6]: Helen gave a deep sigh .
Parsing [sent. 3579 len. 3]: Fancied sorrows !
Parsing [sent. 3580 len. 14]: -- Yes , gladly indeed would she live for ONE other at least !
Parsing [sent. 3581 len. 9]: Nay more -- she would die for him .
Parsing [sent. 3582 len. 3]: But alas !
Parsing [sent. 3583 len. 15]: what would that do for one whose very being was consumed with grief ineffable !
Parsing [sent. 3584 len. 12]: -- She must speak , else he would read her heart .
Parsing [sent. 3585 len. 10]: `` There are real sorrows , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 3586 len. 8]: `` They are not all fancied . ''
Parsing [sent. 3587 len. 41]: `` There are very few sorrows , '' returned George , `` in which fancy does not bear a stronger proportion than even a woman of sense , while the fancy is upon her , will be prepared to admit .
Parsing [sent. 3588 len. 49]: I can remember bursts of grief when I was a boy , in which it seemed impossible anything should ever console me ; but in one minute all would be gone , and my heart , or my spleen , or my diaphragm , as merry as ever .
Parsing [sent. 3589 len. 25]: Believe that all is well , and you will find all will be well -- very tolerably well , that is , considering . ''
Parsing [sent. 3590 len. 36]: `` Considering that the well-being has to be divided and apportioned and accommodated to the various parts of such a huge whole , and that there is no God to look after the business ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3591 len. 27]: said Helen , who , according to the state of the tide in the sea of her trouble , resented or accepted her cousin 's teaching .
Parsing [sent. 3592 len. 9]: Few women are willing to believe in death .
Parsing [sent. 3593 len. 58]: Most of them love life , and are faithful to hope ; and I much doubt whether , if Helen had but had a taste of trouble to rouse the woman within her before her cousin conceived the wish of making her a proselyte , she would have turned even a tolerably patient ear to his instructions .
Parsing [sent. 3594 len. 46]: Yet it is strange to see how even noble women , with the divine gift of imagination , may be argued into unbelief in their best instincts by some small man , as common-place as clever , who beside them is as limestone to marble .
Parsing [sent. 3595 len. 47]: The knowing craft comes creeping up into the shadow of the rich galleon , and lo , with all her bountiful sails gleaming in the sun , the ship of God glides off in the wake of the felucca to the sweltering hollows betwixt the winds !
Parsing [sent. 3596 len. 13]: `` You perplex me , my dear cousin , '' said Bascombe .
Parsing [sent. 3597 len. 13]: `` It is plain your nursing has been too much for you .
Parsing [sent. 3598 len. 9]: You see everything with a jaundiced eye . ''
Parsing [sent. 3599 len. 11]: `` Thank you , Cousin George , '' said Helen .
Parsing [sent. 3600 len. 10]: `` You are even more courteous than usual . ''
Parsing [sent. 3601 len. 10]: She turned from him and went into the house .
Parsing [sent. 3602 len. 25]: Bascombe walked to the bottom of the garden and lighted his cigar , confessing to himself that for once he could not understand Helen .
Parsing [sent. 3603 len. 41]: -- Was it then only that he was ignorant of the awful fact that lay burrowing in her heart , or was he not ignorant also of the nature of that heart in which such a fact must so burrow ?
Parsing [sent. 3604 len. 15]: Was there anything in his system to wipe off that burning , torturing red ?
Parsing [sent. 3605 len. 20]: `` Such things must be : men who wrong society must suffer for the sake of that society . ''
Parsing [sent. 3606 len. 18]: But the red lay burning on the conscience of Helen too , and she had not murdered !
Parsing [sent. 3607 len. 59]: And for him who had , he gave society never a thought , but shrieked aloud in his dreams , and moaned and wept when he waked over the memory of the woman who had wronged him , and whom he had , if Bascombe was right , swept out of being like an aphis from a rose-leaf .
Parsing [sent. 3608 len. 3]: CHAPTER XVI .
Parsing [sent. 3609 len. 4]: A VANISHING GLIMMER .
Parsing [sent. 3610 len. 29]: Helen ran upstairs , dropped on her knees by her brother 's bedside , and fell into a fit of sobbing , which no tears came to relieve .
Parsing [sent. 3611 len. 3]: `` Helen !
Parsing [sent. 3612 len. 2]: Helen !
Parsing [sent. 3613 len. 19]: if you give way I shall go mad , '' said a voice of misery from the pillow .
Parsing [sent. 3614 len. 9]: She jumped up , wiping her dry eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3615 len. 22]: `` What a wicked , selfish , bad sister , bad nurse , bad everything , I am , Poldie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3616 len. 15]: she said , her tone ascending the steps of vocal indignation as she spoke .
Parsing [sent. 3617 len. 45]: `` But shall I tell you '' -- here she looked all about the chamber and into the dressing-room ere she proceeded -- `` shall I tell you , Poldie , what it is that makes me so -- I do n't know what ?
Parsing [sent. 3618 len. 14]: -- It is all the fault of the sermon I heard this morning .
Parsing [sent. 3619 len. 30]: It is the first sermon I ever really listened to in my life -- certainly the first I ever thought about again after I was out of the church .
Parsing [sent. 3620 len. 13]: Somehow or other of late Mr. Wingfold has been preaching so strangely !
Parsing [sent. 3621 len. 12]: but this is the first time I have cared to listen .
Parsing [sent. 3622 len. 33]: Do you know he preaches as if he actually believed the things he was saying , and not only that , but as if he expected to persuade you of them too !
Parsing [sent. 3623 len. 29]: I USED to think all clergymen believed them , but I doubt it now more than ever , for Mr. Wingfold speaks so differently and looks so different .
Parsing [sent. 3624 len. 25]: I never saw any clergyman look like that ; and I never saw such a change on a man as there is on him .
Parsing [sent. 3625 len. 9]: There must be something to account for it .
Parsing [sent. 3626 len. 27]: Could it be that he has himself really gone to -- as he says -- and found rest -- or something he had n't got before ?
Parsing [sent. 3627 len. 19]: But you wo n't know what I mean unless I tell you first what he was preaching about .
Parsing [sent. 3628 len. 25]: His text was : Come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden ; -- a common enough text , you know ?
Parsing [sent. 3629 len. 2]: Poldie !
Parsing [sent. 3630 len. 49]: but somehow it seemed fresh to him , and he made it look fresh to me , for I felt as if it had n't been intended for preaching about at all , but for going straight into people 's hearts its own self , without any sermon .
Parsing [sent. 3631 len. 48]: I think the way he did it was this : he first made us feel the sort of person that said the words , and then made us feel that he did say them , and so made us want to see what they could really mean .
Parsing [sent. 3632 len. 60]: But of course what made them so different to me , was '' -- here Helen did burst into tears , but she fought with her sobs , and went on -- `` was -- was -- that my heart is breaking for you , Poldie -- for I shall never see you smile again , my darling ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3633 len. 20]: She buried her face on his pillow , and Leopold uttered `` a great and exceeding bitter cry . ''
Parsing [sent. 3634 len. 23]: Her hand was on his mouth instantly , and her sobs ceased , while the tears kept flowing down her white face .
Parsing [sent. 3635 len. 34]: `` Just think , Poldie , '' she said , in a voice which she seemed to have borrowed in her need from some one else , '' -- just think a moment !
Parsing [sent. 3636 len. 39]: What if there should be some help in the great wide universe -- somewhere , for as wide as it is -- a heart that feels for us both , as my heart feels for you , Poldie !
Parsing [sent. 3637 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 3638 len. 2]: oh !
Parsing [sent. 3639 len. 6]: would n't it be grand ?
Parsing [sent. 3640 len. 13]: Would n't it be lovely to be at peace again , Poldie ?
Parsing [sent. 3641 len. 17]: If there should be somebody somewhere who could take this gnawing serpent from my heart ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3642 len. 8]: -- She pulled wildly at her dress .
Parsing [sent. 3643 len. 29]: -- '' ` Come unto me , ' he said , ` all ye that labour and are heavy laden , and I will give you rest . '
Parsing [sent. 3644 len. 9]: That 's what he said : -- oh !
Parsing [sent. 3645 len. 7]: if it could be true ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3646 len. 26]: `` Surely it is -- for you , best of sisters , '' cried Leopold ; `` but what has it to do with me ?
Parsing [sent. 3647 len. 2]: Nothing .
Parsing [sent. 3648 len. 8]: She is DEAD -- I killed her .
Parsing [sent. 3649 len. 27]: Even if God were to raise her to life again , HE could not make it that I did n't drive the knife into her heart !
Parsing [sent. 3650 len. 4]: Give ME rest !
Parsing [sent. 3651 len. 10]: -- why there 's the hand that did it !
Parsing [sent. 3652 len. 4]: O my God !
Parsing [sent. 3653 len. 4]: my God ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3654 len. 40]: cried the poor youth , and stared at his thin wasted hand , through which the light shone red , as at a conscious evil thing that had done the deed , and was still stained with its signs .
Parsing [sent. 3655 len. 43]: `` God CA N'T be very angry with you , Poldie , '' sobbed Helen , feeling about blindly in the dark forest of her thoughts for some herb of comfort , and offering any leaf upon which her hand fell first .
Parsing [sent. 3656 len. 11]: `` Then he ai n't fit to be God ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3657 len. 4]: cried Leopold fiercely .
Parsing [sent. 3658 len. 25]: `` I would n't have a word to say to a God that did n't cut a man in pieces for such a deed !
Parsing [sent. 3659 len. 8]: Oh Helen , she was so lovely !
Parsing [sent. 3660 len. 8]: -- and what is she now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3661 len. 18]: `` Surely if there were a God , he would do something to set it right somehow !
Parsing [sent. 3662 len. 23]: I know if I was God , Poldie , I should find some way of setting you up again , my darling .
Parsing [sent. 3663 len. 13]: You ai n't half as bad as you make yourself out . ''
Parsing [sent. 3664 len. 25]: `` You had better tell that to the jury , Helen , and see how they will take it , '' said Leopold contemptuously .
Parsing [sent. 3665 len. 5]: `` The jury ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3666 len. 4]: Helen almost screamed .
Parsing [sent. 3667 len. 9]: `` What do you mean , Poldie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3668 len. 4]: `` Well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3669 len. 18]: returned Leopold , in a tone of justification , but made no further answer to her question .
Parsing [sent. 3670 len. 38]: `` All God can do to set it right , '' he resumed , after a pause , `` is to damn me for ever and ever , as one of the blackest creatures in creation . ''
Parsing [sent. 3671 len. 10]: `` THAT I do n't believe , anyhow ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3672 len. 8]: returned Helen with equal vehemence and indefiniteness .
Parsing [sent. 3673 len. 16]: And for the first time , George Bascombe 's teachings were a comfort to her .
Parsing [sent. 3674 len. 8]: It was all nonsense about a God .
Parsing [sent. 3675 len. 30]: As to her brother 's misery , it had no source but that to which Shakespeare attributed the misery of Macbeth -- and who should know better than Shakespeare ?
Parsing [sent. 3676 len. 14]: -- the fear , namely , of people doing the like to himself !
Parsing [sent. 3677 len. 7]: But straightway thereupon -- horrible thought !
Parsing [sent. 3678 len. 7]: -- she found herself -- yes !
Parsing [sent. 3679 len. 18]: it was in her -- call it thought , or call it feeling , it was hers !
Parsing [sent. 3680 len. 10]: -- she found herself despising her poor crushed brother !
Parsing [sent. 3681 len. 4]: disgusted with him !
Parsing [sent. 3682 len. 23]: turning from him , not even in scorn of his weakness , but in anger at what he had brought upon her !
Parsing [sent. 3683 len. 59]: It was but a flash of the lightning of hell : one glance of his great , troubled , appealing , yet hopeless eyes , vague with the fogs that steamed up from the Phlegethon within him , was enough to turn her anger at him into hate of herself who had stabbed his angel in her heart .
Parsing [sent. 3684 len. 24]: Then in herself she knew that all murderers are not of Macbeth 's order , and that all remorse is not for oneself .
Parsing [sent. 3685 len. 18]: But where was the God to be found who could and MIGHT help in the wretched case ?
Parsing [sent. 3686 len. 7]: How were they to approach him ?
Parsing [sent. 3687 len. 8]: Or what could he do for them ?
Parsing [sent. 3688 len. 42]: Were such a being to assure Leopold that no hurt should come to him -- even that he thought little of the wrong that he had done -- would that make his crushed heart begin to swell again with fresh life ?
Parsing [sent. 3689 len. 22]: would that bring back Emmeline from the dark grave and the worms to the sunny earth and the speech of men ?
Parsing [sent. 3690 len. 17]: And whither , yet farther , he might have sent her , she dared not think .
Parsing [sent. 3691 len. 23]: And Leopold was not merely at strife with himself , but condemned to dwell with a self that was loathsome to him .
Parsing [sent. 3692 len. 19]: She no longer saw any glimmer of hope but such as lay in George 's doctrine of death .
Parsing [sent. 3693 len. 21]: If there was no helper who could clean hearts and revive the light of life , then welcome gaunt death !
Parsing [sent. 3694 len. 10]: let the grim-mouthed skeleton be crowned at every feast !
Parsing [sent. 3695 len. 3]: CHAPTER XVII .
Parsing [sent. 3696 len. 4]: LET US PRAY !
Parsing [sent. 3697 len. 29]: That was the sole chink in the prison where these two sat immured alone from their kind -- unless , indeed , the curate might know of another .
Parsing [sent. 3698 len. 22]: One thing Helen had ground for being certain of -- that the curate would tell them no more than he knew .
Parsing [sent. 3699 len. 19]: Even George Bascombe , who did not believe one thing he said , counted him an honest man !
Parsing [sent. 3700 len. 29]: Might she venture to consult him , putting the case as of a person who had done very wrong -- say stolen money or committed forgery or something ?
Parsing [sent. 3701 len. 17]: Might she not thus gather a little honey of comfort and bring it home to Leopold ?
Parsing [sent. 3702 len. 36]: Thinking thus and thus she sat silent ; and all the time the suffering eyes were fixed upon her face , looking for no comfort , but finding there all they ever had of rest .
Parsing [sent. 3703 len. 11]: `` Are you thinking about the sermon , Helen ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3704 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 3705 len. 13]: `` What was it you were telling me about it just now ?
Parsing [sent. 3706 len. 5]: Who preached it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3707 len. 9]: `` Mr. Wingfold , '' she answered listlessly .
Parsing [sent. 3708 len. 7]: `` Who is Mr. Wingfold ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3709 len. 8]: `` Our curate at the Abbey . ''
Parsing [sent. 3710 len. 9]: `` What sort of man is he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3711 len. 18]: `` Oh , a man somewhere about thirty -- a straightforward , ordinary kind of man . ''
Parsing [sent. 3712 len. 4]: `` Ah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3713 len. 35]: said Leopld -- then added after a moment -- `` I was hoping he might be an old man , with a grey head , like the brahmin who used to teach me Sanscrit .
Parsing [sent. 3714 len. 13]: -- I wish I had treated him better , poor old fellow !
Parsing [sent. 3715 len. 7]: and learned a little more . ''
Parsing [sent. 3716 len. 8]: `` What does it matter about Sanscrit ?
Parsing [sent. 3717 len. 9]: Why should you make troubles of trifles ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3718 len. 14]: said Helen , whose trials had at last begun to undermine her temper .
Parsing [sent. 3719 len. 20]: `` It was not of the Sanscrit , but the moonshee I was thinking , '' answered Leopold mildly .
Parsing [sent. 3720 len. 5]: `` You darling ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3721 len. 6]: cried Helen , already repentant .
Parsing [sent. 3722 len. 40]: But with the revulsion she felt that this state of things could not long continue -- she must either lose her senses , or turn into something hateful to herself : the strain was more than she could bear .
Parsing [sent. 3723 len. 21]: She MUST speak to somebody , and she would try whether she could not approach the subject with Mr. Wingfold .
Parsing [sent. 3724 len. 8]: But how was she to see him ?
Parsing [sent. 3725 len. 30]: It would be awkward to call upon him at his lodgings , and she must see him absolutely alone to dare a whisper of what was on her mind .
Parsing [sent. 3726 len. 33]: As she thus reflected , the thought of what people would say , were it remarked that she contrived to meet the curate , brought a shadow of scorn upon her face .
Parsing [sent. 3727 len. 30]: Leopold saw the expression , and , sensitive as an ailing woman , said , `` Helen , what HAVE I done to make you look like that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3728 len. 10]: `` How did I look , my Poldie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3729 len. 15]: she asked , turning on him eyes like brimming wells of love and tenderness .
Parsing [sent. 3730 len. 42]: `` Let me see , '' answered Leopold ; and after a moment 's thought replied , `` As Milton 's Satan might have looked if Mammon had counselled him to make off with the crown-jewels instead of declaring war . ''
Parsing [sent. 3731 len. 6]: `` Ah , Poldie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3732 len. 25]: cried Helen , delighted at the stray glance of sunshine , and kissing him as she spoke , `` you must really be better !
Parsing [sent. 3733 len. 7]: I 'll tell you what ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3734 len. 36]: she exclaimed joyfully , as a new thought struck her : `` As soon as you are able , we will set out for New York -- to pay Uncle Tom a visit of course !
Parsing [sent. 3735 len. 11]: but we shall never be seen or heard of again .
Parsing [sent. 3736 len. 23]: At New York we will change our names , cross to San Francisco , and from there sail for the Sandwich Islands .
Parsing [sent. 3737 len. 35]: Perhaps we may be able to find a little one to buy , just big enough for us two ; and you shall marry a nice native -- '' Her forced gaiety gave way .
Parsing [sent. 3738 len. 20]: She burst out weeping afresh , and throwing her arms round him , sobbed -- `` Poldie , Poldie !
Parsing [sent. 3739 len. 30]: you can pray : cry to God to help us somehow or other ; and if there be no God to hear us , then let us die together .
Parsing [sent. 3740 len. 10]: There are easy ways of it , Poldie . ''
Parsing [sent. 3741 len. 4]: `` Thank you !
Parsing [sent. 3742 len. 7]: thank you , sister dear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3743 len. 24]: he answered , pressing her to his bosom : `` that is the first word of real comfort you have spoken to me .
Parsing [sent. 3744 len. 12]: I shall not be afraid if you go with me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3745 len. 30]: It was indeed a comfort to both of them to remember that there was this alternative equally to the gallows and a long life of gnawing fear and remorse .
Parsing [sent. 3746 len. 12]: But it was only to be a last refuge of course .
Parsing [sent. 3747 len. 54]: Helen withdrew to the dressing-room , laid herself on her bed , and began to compass how to meet and circumvent the curate , so as by an innocent cunning to wile from him on false pretences what spiritual balm she might so gain for the torn heart and conscience of her brother .
Parsing [sent. 3748 len. 32]: There was no doubt it would be genuine , and the best to be had , seeing George Bascombe , who was honesty itself , judged the curate an honest man .
Parsing [sent. 3749 len. 8]: But how was it to be done ?
Parsing [sent. 3750 len. 7]: She could see only one way .
Parsing [sent. 3751 len. 21]: With some inconsistency , she resolved to cast herself on his generosity , and yet would not trust him entirely .
Parsing [sent. 3752 len. 15]: She did not go downstairs again , but had her tea with her brother .
Parsing [sent. 3753 len. 63]: In the evening her aunt went out to visit some of her pensioners , for it was one of Mrs. Ramshorn 's clerical duties to be kind to the poor -- a good deal at their expense , I am afraid -- and presently George came to the door of the sick-room to beg her to go down and sing to him .
Parsing [sent. 3754 len. 52]: Of course , in the house of a dean 's relict , no music except sacred must be heard on a Sunday ; but to have Helen sing it , George would condescend even to a hymn tune ; and there was Handel , for whom he professed a great admiration !
Parsing [sent. 3755 len. 5]: What mattered his subjects ?
Parsing [sent. 3756 len. 30]: He could but compose the sort of thing the court wanted of him , and in order to that , had to fuddle his brains first , poor fellow !
Parsing [sent. 3757 len. 6]: So said George at least .
Parsing [sent. 3758 len. 66]: That Leopold might not hear them talking outside his door , a thing which no invalid likes , Helen went downstairs with her cousin ; but although she had often sung from Handel for his pleasure , content to reproduce the bare sounds , and caring nothing about the feelings both they and the words represented , she positively refused this evening to gratify him .
Parsing [sent. 3759 len. 7]: She must go back to Leopold .
Parsing [sent. 3760 len. 23]: She would sing from The Creation if he liked , but nothing out of The Messiah would she or could she sing .
Parsing [sent. 3761 len. 64]: Perhaps she could herself hardly have told why , but George perceived the lingering influence of the morning 's sermon , and more vexed than he had ever yet been with her , for he could not endure her to cherish the least prejudice in favour of what he despised , he said he would overtake his aunt , and left the house .
Parsing [sent. 3762 len. 22]: The moment he was gone , she went to the piano , and began to sing , `` Comfort ye . ''
Parsing [sent. 3763 len. 14]: When she came to `` Come unto me , '' she broke down .
Parsing [sent. 3764 len. 45]: But with sudden resolution she rose , and , having opened every door between it and her brother , raised the top of the piano , and then sang , `` Come unto me , '' as she had never sung in her life .
Parsing [sent. 3765 len. 6]: Nor did she stop there .
Parsing [sent. 3766 len. 40]: At the distance of six of the wide-standing houses , her aunt and cousin heard her singing `` Thou didst not leave , '' with the tone and expression of a prophetess -- of a Maenad , George said .
Parsing [sent. 3767 len. 20]: She was still singing when he opened the door , but when they reached the drawing-room she was gone .
Parsing [sent. 3768 len. 7]: She was kneeling beside her brother .
Parsing [sent. 3769 len. 3]: CHAPTER XVIII .
Parsing [sent. 3770 len. 3]: TWO LETTERS .
Parsing [sent. 3771 len. 27]: The next morning , as Wingfold ate his breakfast by an open window looking across the churchyard , he received a letter by the local post .
Parsing [sent. 3772 len. 30]: It was as follows : -- `` Dear Mr. Wingfold , I am about to take an unheard-of liberty , but my reasons are such as make me bold .
Parsing [sent. 3773 len. 15]: The day may come when I shall be able to tell you them all .
Parsing [sent. 3774 len. 8]: Meantime I hope you can help me .
Parsing [sent. 3775 len. 30]: I want very much to ask your counsel upon a certain matter , and I can not beg you to call , for my aunt knows nothing of it .
Parsing [sent. 3776 len. 9]: Could you contrive a suitable way of meeting ?
Parsing [sent. 3777 len. 22]: You may imagine my necessity is grievous when I thus expose myself to the possible bitterness of my own after judgment .
Parsing [sent. 3778 len. 16]: But I must have confidence in the man who spoke as you did yesterday morning .
Parsing [sent. 3779 len. 13]: I am , dear Mr. Wingfold , sincerely yours , Helen Lingard .
Parsing [sent. 3780 len. 20]: `` P.S. -- I shall be walking along Pine Street from our end , at eleven o'clock to-morrow . ''
Parsing [sent. 3781 len. 10]: The curate was not taken with a great surprise .
Parsing [sent. 3782 len. 16]: But something like fear overshadowed him at finding his sermons come back upon him thus .
Parsing [sent. 3783 len. 22]: Was he , an unbelieving labourer , to go reaping with his blunt and broken sickle where the corn was ripest !
Parsing [sent. 3784 len. 11]: But he had no time to think about that now .
Parsing [sent. 3785 len. 17]: It was nearly ten o'clock , and she would be looking for her answer at eleven .
Parsing [sent. 3786 len. 43]: He had not to think long , however , before he saw what seemed a suitable plan to suggest ; whereupon he wrote as follows : `` Dear Miss Lingard , I need not say that I am entirely at your service .
Parsing [sent. 3787 len. 18]: But I am doubtful if the only way that occurs to me will commend itself to you .
Parsing [sent. 3788 len. 27]: I know what I am about to propose is safe , but you may not have sufficient confidence in my judgment to accept it as such .
Parsing [sent. 3789 len. 26]: `` Doubtless you have seen the two deformed persons , an uncle and niece , named Polwarth , who keep the gate of Osterfield Park .
Parsing [sent. 3790 len. 62]: I know them well , and , strange as it may seem , I must tell you , in order that you may partake of my confidence , that whatever change you may have observed in my public work is owing to the influence of those two , who have more faith in God than I have ever met with before .
Parsing [sent. 3791 len. 26]: It may not be amiss to mention also that , although poor and distorted , they are of gentle blood as well as noble nature .
Parsing [sent. 3792 len. 17]: With this preamble , I venture to propose that you should meet me at their cottage .
Parsing [sent. 3793 len. 30]: To them it would not appear at all strange that one of my congregation should wish to see me alone , and I know you may trust their discretion .
Parsing [sent. 3794 len. 26]: But while I write thus , with all confidence in you and in them , I must tell you that I have none in myself .
Parsing [sent. 3795 len. 15]: I feel both ashamed and perplexed that you should imagine any help in me .
Parsing [sent. 3796 len. 14]: Of all I know , I am the poorest creature to give counsel .
Parsing [sent. 3797 len. 36]: All I can say for myself is that I think I see a glimmer of light , and light is light , through whatever cranny , and into whatever poverty-stricken chamber , it may fall .
Parsing [sent. 3798 len. 7]: Whatever I see I will say .
Parsing [sent. 3799 len. 14]: If I can see nothing to help you , I will be silent .
Parsing [sent. 3800 len. 19]: And yet I may be able to direct you where to find what I can not give you .
Parsing [sent. 3801 len. 26]: If you accept my plan , and will appoint day and hour , I shall acquaint the Polwarths with the service we desire of them .
Parsing [sent. 3802 len. 14]: Should you object to it , I shall try to think of another .
Parsing [sent. 3803 len. 15]: I am , dear Miss Lingard , yours very truly , Thomas Wingfold . ''
Parsing [sent. 3804 len. 30]: He placed the letter between the pages of a pamphlet , took his hat and stick , and was walking down Pine Street as the Abbey clock struck eleven .
Parsing [sent. 3805 len. 30]: Midway he met Helen , shook hands with her , and , after an indifferent word or two , gave her the pamphlet , and bade her good morning .
Parsing [sent. 3806 len. 4]: Helen hurried home .
Parsing [sent. 3807 len. 25]: It had required all her self-command to look him in the face , and her heart beat almost painfully as she opened the letter .
Parsing [sent. 3808 len. 14]: She could not but be pleased -- even more than pleased with it .
Parsing [sent. 3809 len. 25]: If the secret had been her own , she thought she could have trusted him entirely ; but she must not expose poor Leopold .
Parsing [sent. 3810 len. 27]: By the next post the curate received a grateful answer , appointing the time , and expressing perfect readiness to trust those whom he had tried .
Parsing [sent. 3811 len. 26]: She was received at the cottage door by Rachel , who asked her to walk into the garden , where Mr. Wingfold was expecting her .
Parsing [sent. 3812 len. 11]: The curate led her to a seat overgrown with honeysuckle .
Parsing [sent. 3813 len. 3]: CHAPTER XIX .
Parsing [sent. 3814 len. 5]: ADVICE IN THE DARK .
Parsing [sent. 3815 len. 25]: It was some moments before either of them spoke , and it did not help Wingfold that she sat clouded by a dark-coloured veil .
Parsing [sent. 3816 len. 22]: At length he said , `` You must not fear to trust me because I doubt my ability to help you .
Parsing [sent. 3817 len. 10]: I can at least assure you of my sympathy .
Parsing [sent. 3818 len. 14]: The trouble I have myself had enables me to promise you that . ''
Parsing [sent. 3819 len. 30]: `` Can you tell me , '' she said , from behind more veils than that of lace , `` how to get rid of a haunting idea ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3820 len. 19]: `` That depends on the nature of the idea , I should imagine , '' answered the curate .
Parsing [sent. 3821 len. 23]: `` Such things sometimes arise merely from the state of the health , and there the doctor is the best help . ''
Parsing [sent. 3822 len. 14]: Helen shook her head , and smiled behind her veil a grievous smile .
Parsing [sent. 3823 len. 14]: The curate paused , but , receiving no assistance , ventured on again .
Parsing [sent. 3824 len. 36]: `` If it be a thought of something past and gone , for which nothing can be done , I think activity in one 's daily work must be the best aid to endurance . ''
Parsing [sent. 3825 len. 4]: `` Oh dear !
Parsing [sent. 3826 len. 4]: oh dear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3827 len. 18]: sighed Helen -- `` when one has no heart to endure , and hates the very sunlight !
Parsing [sent. 3828 len. 18]: -- You would n't talk about work to a man dying of hunger , would you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3829 len. 9]: `` I 'm not sure about that . ''
Parsing [sent. 3830 len. 8]: `` He would n't heed you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3831 len. 5]: `` Perhaps not . ''
Parsing [sent. 3832 len. 8]: `` What would you do then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3833 len. 15]: `` Give him some food , and try him again , I think . ''
Parsing [sent. 3834 len. 18]: `` Then give me some food -- some hope , I mean , and try me again .
Parsing [sent. 3835 len. 15]: Without that , I do n't care about duty or life or anything . ''
Parsing [sent. 3836 len. 28]: `` Tell me , then , what is the matter ; I MAY be able to hint at some hope , '' said Wingfold , very gently .
Parsing [sent. 3837 len. 9]: `` Do you call yourself a Christian ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3838 len. 25]: The question would to most people have sounded strange , abrupt , inquisitorial ; but to Helen it sounded not one of them all .
Parsing [sent. 3839 len. 7]: `` No , '' she answered .
Parsing [sent. 3840 len. 4]: `` Ah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3841 len. 11]: said the curate a little sadly , and went on .
Parsing [sent. 3842 len. 16]: `` Because then I could have said , you know where to go for comfort .
Parsing [sent. 3843 len. 34]: -- Might it not be well however to try if there is any to be had from him that said ` COME UNTO ME , AND I WILL GIVE YOU REST ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 3844 len. 8]: `` I can do nothing with that .
Parsing [sent. 3845 len. 15]: I have tried and tried to pray , but it is of no use .
Parsing [sent. 3846 len. 18]: There is such a weight on my heart that no power of mine can lift it up .
Parsing [sent. 3847 len. 18]: I suppose it is because I can not believe there is anyone hearing a word I say .
Parsing [sent. 3848 len. 43]: Yesterday , when I got alone in the park , I prayed aloud : I thought that perhaps , even if he might not be able to read what was in my heart , he might be able to hear my voice .
Parsing [sent. 3849 len. 26]: I was even foolish enough to wish I knew Greek , because perhaps he would understand me better if I were to pray in Greek .
Parsing [sent. 3850 len. 5]: My brain seems turning .
Parsing [sent. 3851 len. 6]: It is of no use !
Parsing [sent. 3852 len. 7]: There is no help anywhere ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3853 len. 11]: She tried hard , but could not prevent a sob .
Parsing [sent. 3854 len. 8]: And then came a burst of tears .
Parsing [sent. 3855 len. 11]: `` Will you not tell me something about it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3856 len. 8]: said the curate , yet more gently .
Parsing [sent. 3857 len. 13]: Oh , how gladly would he relieve her heart if he might !
Parsing [sent. 3858 len. 49]: `` Perhaps Jesus has begun to give you help , though you do not know it yet , '' he said , `` His help may be on the way to you , or even with you , only you do not recognize it for what it is .
Parsing [sent. 3859 len. 8]: I have known that kind of thing .
Parsing [sent. 3860 len. 13]: Tell me some fact or some feeling I can lay hold of .
Parsing [sent. 3861 len. 22]: Possibly there is something you ought to do and are not doing , and that is why you can not rest .
Parsing [sent. 3862 len. 17]: I think Jesus would give no rest except in the way of learning of him . ''
Parsing [sent. 3863 len. 16]: Helen 's sobs ceased , but what appeared to the curate a long silence followed .
Parsing [sent. 3864 len. 28]: At length she said , with faltering voice : `` Suppose it were a great wrong that had been done , and that was the unendurable thought ?
Parsing [sent. 3865 len. 13]: SUPPOSE , I say , that was what made me miserable ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3866 len. 17]: `` Then you must of course make all possible reparation , '' answered Wingfold at once .
Parsing [sent. 3867 len. 11]: `` But if none were possible -- what then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3868 len. 15]: Here the answer was not so plain , and the curate had to think .
Parsing [sent. 3869 len. 22]: `` At least , '' he said at length , `` you could confess the wrong , and ask forgiveness . ''
Parsing [sent. 3870 len. 28]: `` But if that also were impossible , '' said Helen , shuddering inwardly to find how near she drew to the edge of the awful fact .
Parsing [sent. 3871 len. 8]: Again the curate took time to reply .
Parsing [sent. 3872 len. 28]: `` I am endeavouring to answer your questions as well as I can , '' he said ; `` but it is hard to deal with generalities .
Parsing [sent. 3873 len. 17]: You see how useless , for that very reason , my answers have as yet been !
Parsing [sent. 3874 len. 30]: Still I have something more to say , and hesitate only because it may imply more confidence than I dare profess , and of all things I dread untruth .
Parsing [sent. 3875 len. 66]: But I am honest in this much at least , that I desire with true heart to find a God who will acknowledge me as his creature and make me his child , and if there be any God I am nearly certain he will do so ; for surely there can not be any other kind of God than the Father of Jesus Christ !
Parsing [sent. 3876 len. 65]: In the strength of this much of conscious truth I venture to say -- that no crime can be committed against a creature without being committed also against the creator of that creature ; therefore surely the first step for anyone who has committed such a crime must be to humble himself before God , confess the sin , and ask forgiveness and cleansing .
Parsing [sent. 3877 len. 59]: If there is anything in religion at all it must rest upon an actual individual communication between God and the creature he has made ; and if God heard the man 's prayer and forgave him , then the man would certainly know it in his heart and be consoled -- perhaps by the gift of humility . ''
Parsing [sent. 3878 len. 14]: `` Then you think confession to God is all that is required ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3879 len. 15]: `` If there be no one else wronged to whom confession can be made .
Parsing [sent. 3880 len. 55]: If the case were mine -- and sometimes I much fear that in taking holy orders I have grievously sinned -- I should then do just as I have done with regard to that -- cry to the living power which I think originated me , to set the matter right for me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3881 len. 11]: `` But if it could not be set right ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3882 len. 9]: `` Then to forgive and console me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3883 len. 3]: `` Alas !
Parsing [sent. 3884 len. 2]: alas !
Parsing [sent. 3885 len. 7]: that he will not hear of .
Parsing [sent. 3886 len. 8]: He would rather be punished than consoled .
Parsing [sent. 3887 len. 6]: I fear for his brain .
Parsing [sent. 3888 len. 8]: But indeed that might be well . ''
Parsing [sent. 3889 len. 36]: She had gone much farther than she had intended ; but the more doubtful help became , the more she was driven by the agony of a perishing hope to search the heart of Wingfold .
Parsing [sent. 3890 len. 5]: Again the curate pondered .
Parsing [sent. 3891 len. 34]: `` Are you sure , '' he said at length , `` that the person of whom you speak is not neglecting something he ought to do -- something he knows perhaps ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3892 len. 12]: He had come back to the same with which he started .
Parsing [sent. 3893 len. 10]: Through her veil he saw her turn deadly white .
Parsing [sent. 3894 len. 15]: Ever since Leopold said the word JURY , a ghastly fear had haunted Helen .
Parsing [sent. 3895 len. 12]: She pressed her hand on her heart and made no answer .
Parsing [sent. 3896 len. 20]: `` I speak from experience , '' the curate went on -- `` from what else could I speak ?
Parsing [sent. 3897 len. 22]: I know that so long as we hang back from doing what conscience urges , there is no peace for us .
Parsing [sent. 3898 len. 48]: I will not say our prayers are not heard , for Mr. Polwarth has taught me that the most precious answer prayer can have , lies in the growing strength of the impulse towards the dreaded duty , and in the ever sharper stings of the conscience .
Parsing [sent. 3899 len. 18]: I think I asked already whether there were no relatives to whom reparation could be made ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3900 len. 19]: `` Yes , yes , '' gasped Helen ; '' and I told you reparation was impossible . ''
Parsing [sent. 3901 len. 9]: Her voice had sunk almost to a groan .
Parsing [sent. 3902 len. 16]: `` But at least confession -- '' said Wingfold -- and started from his seat .
Parsing [sent. 3903 len. 3]: CHAPTER XX .
Parsing [sent. 3904 len. 2]: INTERCESSION .
Parsing [sent. 3905 len. 7]: A stifled cry had interrupted him .
Parsing [sent. 3906 len. 9]: Helen was pressing her handkerchief to her mouth .
Parsing [sent. 3907 len. 7]: She rose and ran from him .
Parsing [sent. 3908 len. 6]: Wingfold stood alarmed and irresolute .
Parsing [sent. 3909 len. 27]: She had not gone many steps , however , when her pace slackened , her knees gave way , and she dropped senseless on the grass .
Parsing [sent. 3910 len. 8]: Wingfold ran to the house for water .
Parsing [sent. 3911 len. 10]: Rachel hastened to her assistance , and Polwarth followed .
Parsing [sent. 3912 len. 11]: It was some time before they succeeded in reviving her .
Parsing [sent. 3913 len. 23]: When at length the colour began to return a little to her cheek , Polwarth dropped on his knees at her feet .
Parsing [sent. 3914 len. 21]: Wingfold in his ministrations was already kneeling on one side of her , and Rachel now kneeled on the other .
Parsing [sent. 3915 len. 35]: Then Polwarth said , in his low and husky , yet not altogether unmelodious voice , `` Life eternal , this lady of thine hath a sore heart and we can not help her .
Parsing [sent. 3916 len. 8]: Thou art Help , O mighty Love .
Parsing [sent. 3917 len. 10]: They who know thee best rejoice in thee most .
Parsing [sent. 3918 len. 60]: As thy sun that shines over our heads , as thy air that flows into our bodies , thou art above , around , and in us ; thou art in her heart : Oh speak to her there ; let her know thy will , and give her strength to do it , O Father of Jesus Christ !
Parsing [sent. 3919 len. 3]: Amen . ''
Parsing [sent. 3920 len. 38]: When Helen opened her eyes , she saw only the dark leaves of an arbutus over her , and knew nothing beyond a sense of utter misery and weakness , with an impulse to rise and run .
Parsing [sent. 3921 len. 47]: With an effort she moved her head a little , and then she saw the three kneeling forms , the clergyman with bowed head , and the two dwarfs with shining upturned faces : she thought she was dead and they were kneeling about her corpse .
Parsing [sent. 3922 len. 21]: Her head dropped with a weary sigh of relief , she lay passive , and heard the dwarf 's prayer .
Parsing [sent. 3923 len. 15]: Then she knew that she was not dead , and the disappointment was bitter .
Parsing [sent. 3924 len. 10]: But she thought of Leopold , and was consoled .
Parsing [sent. 3925 len. 24]: After a few minutes of quiet , they helped her into the house , and laid her on a sofa in the parlour .
Parsing [sent. 3926 len. 22]: `` Do n't be frightened , dear lady , '' said the little woman ; `` nobody shall come near you .
Parsing [sent. 3927 len. 11]: We will watch you as if you were the queen .
Parsing [sent. 3928 len. 11]: I am going to get some tea for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3929 len. 12]: But the moment she left the room , Helen got up .
Parsing [sent. 3930 len. 11]: She could not endure a moment longer in the place .
Parsing [sent. 3931 len. 38]: There was a demon at her brother 's ear , whispering to him to confess , to rid himself of his torture by the aid of the law : she must rush home and drive him away .
Parsing [sent. 3932 len. 40]: She took her hat in her hand , opened the door softly , and ere Rachel could say a word , had flitted through the kitchen , and was amongst the trees on the opposite side of the road .
Parsing [sent. 3933 len. 11]: Rachel ran to the garden to her uncle and Wingfold .
Parsing [sent. 3934 len. 11]: They looked at each other for a moment in silence .
Parsing [sent. 3935 len. 10]: `` I will follow her , '' said Wingfold .
Parsing [sent. 3936 len. 6]: `` She may faint again .
Parsing [sent. 3937 len. 8]: If she does I shall whistle . ''
Parsing [sent. 3938 len. 18]: He followed , and kept her in sight until she was safe in her aunt 's garden .
Parsing [sent. 3939 len. 8]: `` What IS to be done ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3940 len. 8]: he said , returning in great trouble .
Parsing [sent. 3941 len. 19]: `` I do not think I made any blunder , but there she is gone in tenfold misery !
Parsing [sent. 3942 len. 18]: I wish I could tell you what passed , but that of course I can not . ''
Parsing [sent. 3943 len. 9]: `` Of course not , '' returned Polwarth .
Parsing [sent. 3944 len. 24]: `` But the fact of her leaving yon so is no sign that you said the wrong thing , -- rather the contrary .
Parsing [sent. 3945 len. 37]: When people seek advice , it is too often in the hope of finding the adviser side with their second familiar self , instead of their awful first self , of which they know so little .
Parsing [sent. 3946 len. 5]: Do not be anxious .
Parsing [sent. 3947 len. 6]: You have done your best .
Parsing [sent. 3948 len. 8]: Wait for what will come next . ''
Parsing [sent. 3949 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXI .
Parsing [sent. 3950 len. 3]: HELEN ALONE .
Parsing [sent. 3951 len. 41]: Helen tottered to a little summer-house in the garden , which had been her best retreat since she had given her room to her brother , and there seated herself to regain breath and composure ere she went to him .
Parsing [sent. 3952 len. 19]: She had sought the door of Paradise , and the door of hell had been opened to her !
Parsing [sent. 3953 len. 32]: If the frightful idea which , she did not doubt , had already suggested itself to Leopold , should now be encouraged , there was nothing but black madness before her !
Parsing [sent. 3954 len. 6]: Her Poldie on the scaffold !
Parsing [sent. 3955 len. 4]: God in heaven !
Parsing [sent. 3956 len. 9]: Infinitely rather would she poison herself and him !
Parsing [sent. 3957 len. 40]: Then she remembered how pleased and consoled he had been when she said something about their dying together , and that reassured her a little : no , she was certain Leopold would never yield himself to public shame !
Parsing [sent. 3958 len. 16]: But she must take care that foolish , extravagant curate should not come near him .
Parsing [sent. 3959 len. 11]: There was no knowing to what he might persuade him !
Parsing [sent. 3960 len. 19]: Poor Poldie was so easily led by any show of nobility -- anything that looked grand or self-sacrificing !
Parsing [sent. 3961 len. 24]: Helen 's only knowledge of guilt came from the pale image of it lifted above her horizon by the refraction of her sympathy .
Parsing [sent. 3962 len. 24]: She did not know , perhaps never would understand the ghastly horror of conscious guilt , besides which there is no evil else .
Parsing [sent. 3963 len. 44]: Agonies of injury a man may endure , and , so far from being overwhelmed , rise above them tenfold a man , who , were he to awake to the self-knowledge of a crime , would sink into a heap of ruin .
Parsing [sent. 3964 len. 52]: Then indeed , if there be no God , or one that has not an infinite power of setting right that which has gone wrong with his work , then indeed welcome the faith , for faith it may then be called , of such as say there is no hereafter !
Parsing [sent. 3965 len. 49]: Helen did not know to what gulfs of personal shame , nay , to what summits of public execration , a man may be glad to flee for refuge from the fangs of home-born guilt -- if so be there is any refuge to be found in either .
Parsing [sent. 3966 len. 11]: And some kind of refuge there does seem to be .
Parsing [sent. 3967 len. 38]: Strange it is and true that in publicity itself lies some relief from the gnawing of the worm -- as if even a cursing humanity were a barrier of protection between the torn soul and its crime .
Parsing [sent. 3968 len. 10]: It flees to its kind for shelter from itself .
Parsing [sent. 3969 len. 18]: Hence , I imagine , in part , may the coolness of some criminals be accounted for .
Parsing [sent. 3970 len. 16]: Their quietness is the relief brought by confession -- even confession but to their fellows .
Parsing [sent. 3971 len. 22]: Is it that the crime seems then lifted a little from their shoulders , and its weight shared by the ace ?
Parsing [sent. 3972 len. 122]: Helen had hoped that the man who had spoken in public so tenderly , and at the same time so powerfully , of the saving heart of the universe , that would have no divisions of pride , no scatterings of hate , but of many would make one , would in private have spoken yet sweeter words of hope and consolation , which she might have carried home in gladness to her sick-souled brother , to comfort and strengthen him -- words of might to allay the burning of the poison within him , and make him feel that after all there was yet a place for him in the universe , and that he was no outcast of Gehenna .
Parsing [sent. 3973 len. 50]: But instead of such words of gentle might , like those of the man of whom he was so fond of talking , he had only spoken drearily of duty , hinting at a horror that would plunge the whole ancient family into a hell of dishonour and contempt !
Parsing [sent. 3974 len. 15]: It did indeed show what mere heartless windbags of effete theology those priests were !
Parsing [sent. 3975 len. 11]: Skeletons they were , and no human beings at all !
Parsing [sent. 3976 len. 4]: -- Her father !
Parsing [sent. 3977 len. 8]: -- the thought of him was distraction !
Parsing [sent. 3978 len. 3]: Her mother !
Parsing [sent. 3979 len. 31]: Oh , if Leopold had had her mother for his too , instead of the dark-skinned woman with the flashing eyes , he would never have brought this upon them !
Parsing [sent. 3980 len. 27]: It was all his mother 's fault -- the fault of her race -- and of the horrible drug her people had taught him to take !
Parsing [sent. 3981 len. 19]: And was he to go and confess it , and be tried for it , and be -- ?
Parsing [sent. 3982 len. 3]: Great God !
Parsing [sent. 3983 len. 15]: -- And here was the priest actually counselling what was worse than any suicide !
Parsing [sent. 3984 len. 32]: Suddenly , however , it occurred to her that the curate had had no knowledge of the facts of the case , and had therefore been compelled to talk at random .
Parsing [sent. 3985 len. 33]: It was impossible he should suspect the crime of which her brother had been guilty , and therefore could not know the frightful consequences of such a confession as he had counselled .
Parsing [sent. 3986 len. 31]: Had she not better then tell him all , and so gather from him some right and reasonable advice for the soothing of the agonies of her poor broken-winged angel ?
Parsing [sent. 3987 len. 3]: But alas !
Parsing [sent. 3988 len. 39]: what security had she that a man capable of such priestly sevei'ity and heartlessness -- her terrors made her thus inconsequent -- would not himself betray the all but innocent sufferer to the vengeance of justice so called ?
Parsing [sent. 3989 len. 8]: No ; she would venture no farther .
Parsing [sent. 3990 len. 32]: Sooner would she go to George Bascombe -- from whom she not only could look for no spiritual comfort , but whose theories were so cruel against culprits of all sorts !
Parsing [sent. 3991 len. 4]: Alas , alas !
Parsing [sent. 3992 len. 4]: she was alone !
Parsing [sent. 3993 len. 10]: absolutely alone in the great waste , death-eyed universe !
Parsing [sent. 3994 len. 30]: -- But for a man to talk so of the tenderness of Jesus Christ , and then serve her as the curate had done -- it was indeed shameless !
Parsing [sent. 3995 len. 12]: HE would never have treated a poor wretched woman like that !
Parsing [sent. 3996 len. 42]: -- And as she said thus to herself , again the words sounded in the ear of her heart : ` COME UNTO ME , ALL YE THAT LABOUR AND ARE HEAVY LADEN , AND I WILL GIVE YOU REST . '
Parsing [sent. 3997 len. 5]: Whence came the voice ?
Parsing [sent. 3998 len. 67]: From her memory , or from that inner chamber of the spirit which the one spirit-bearing spirit keeps for his own in every house that he builds -- alas so long in most human houses shut away from the rest of the rooms and forgotten , or recollected with uneasiness as a lumber-closet in which lie too many things that had better not be looked into ?
Parsing [sent. 3999 len. 25]: But what matter where the voice that had said them , so long as the words were true , and she might believe them !
Parsing [sent. 4000 len. 12]: -- Whatever is true CAN be believed of the true heart .
Parsing [sent. 4001 len. 58]: Ere she knew , Helen was on her knees , with her head on the chair , yet once more crying to the hearer of cries -- possible or impossible being she knew not in the least , but words reported of him had given birth to the cry -- to help her in her dire need .
Parsing [sent. 4002 len. 67]: Instead of any word , or thought even , coming to her that might be fancied an answer , she was scared from her knees by an approaching step -- that of the house-keeper come to look for her with the message from her aunt that Leopold was more restless than usual , not at all like himself , and she could do nothing with him .
Parsing [sent. 4003 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXII .
Parsing [sent. 4004 len. 4]: A HAUNTED SOUL .
Parsing [sent. 4005 len. 17]: Helen rose and hastened to her brother , with a heart of lead in her body .
Parsing [sent. 4006 len. 17]: She started when she saw him : some change had passed on him since the morning !
Parsing [sent. 4007 len. 14]: Was that eager look in his eyes a fresh access of the fever ?
Parsing [sent. 4008 len. 70]: That glimmer on his countenance , doubtful as the first of the morning , when the traveller knows not whether the light be in the sky or only in his brain , did look more like a dawn of his old healthful radiance than any fresh fire of madness ; but at the same time he appeared more wasted and pinched and death-like than she had yet seen him .
Parsing [sent. 4009 len. 25]: Or was it only in her eyes -- was she but reading in his face the agony she had herself gone through that day ?
Parsing [sent. 4010 len. 6]: `` Helen , Helen ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4011 len. 17]: he cried as she entered the room , `` come here , close to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 4012 len. 35]: She hastened to him , sat down on the bedside , took his hand , and looked as cheerfully as she could , yet it was but the more woefully , in his face .
Parsing [sent. 4013 len. 4]: `` Helen ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4014 len. 38]: he said again , and he spoke with a strange expression in his voice , for it seemed that of hope , `` I have been thinking all day of what you told me on Sunday . ''
Parsing [sent. 4015 len. 8]: `` What was that , Poldie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4016 len. 8]: asked Helen with a pang of fear .
Parsing [sent. 4017 len. 11]: `` Why , those words of course -- what else ?
Parsing [sent. 4018 len. 10]: You sang them to me afterwards , you know .
Parsing [sent. 4019 len. 10]: Helen , I should like to see Mr. Wingfold .
Parsing [sent. 4020 len. 13]: Do n't you think he might be able to do something ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4021 len. 9]: `` What sort of thing , Poldie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4022 len. 8]: she faltered , growing sick at heart .
Parsing [sent. 4023 len. 8]: -- Was this what came of praying !
Parsing [sent. 4024 len. 4]: she thought bitterly .
Parsing [sent. 4025 len. 16]: `` Something or other -- I do n't know what exactly , '' returned Leopold .
Parsing [sent. 4026 len. 6]: -- `` Oh Helen ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4027 len. 30]: he broke out with a cry , stifled by the caution that had grown habitual to both of them , `` is there no help of any kind anywhere ?
Parsing [sent. 4028 len. 22]: Surely Mr. Wingfold could tell me something -- comfort me somehow , if I were to tell him all about it !
Parsing [sent. 4029 len. 15]: I could trust the man that said such things as those you told me .
Parsing [sent. 4030 len. 4]: That I could !
Parsing [sent. 4031 len. 3]: -- Oh !
Parsing [sent. 4032 len. 19]: I wish I had n't run away , but had let them take me and hang me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4033 len. 6]: Helen felt herself grow white .
Parsing [sent. 4034 len. 14]: She turned away , and pretended to search for something she had dropped .
Parsing [sent. 4035 len. 22]: `` I do n't think he would be of the slightest use to you , '' she said , still stooping .
Parsing [sent. 4036 len. 15]: And she felt like a devil dragging the soul of her brother to hell .
Parsing [sent. 4037 len. 12]: But that was a foolish fancy , and must be resisted !
Parsing [sent. 4038 len. 9]: `` Not if I told him everything ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4039 len. 15]: Leopold hissed from between his teeth in the struggle to keep down a shriek .
Parsing [sent. 4040 len. 24]: `` No , not if you told him everything , '' she answered , and felt like a judge condemning him to death .
Parsing [sent. 4041 len. 9]: `` What is he there for then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4042 len. 14]: said Leopold indignantly , and turned his face to the wall and moaned .
Parsing [sent. 4043 len. 66]: Helen had not yet thought of asking herself whether her love to her brother was all clear love , and nowise mingled with selfishness -- whether in the fresh horror that day poured into the cup that had seemed already running over , it was of her brother only she thought , or whether threatened shame to herself had not a part in her misery .
Parsing [sent. 4044 len. 34]: But , as far as she was aware , she was quite honest in saying that the curate could not comfort him -- for what attempt even had he made to comfort her ?
Parsing [sent. 4045 len. 12]: What had he done but utter common-places and truisms about duty ?
Parsing [sent. 4046 len. 68]: And who could tell but -- indeed was she not certain that such a man , bringing the artillery of his fanaticism to bear upon her poor boy 's wild enthusiastic temperament , would speedily persuade him to make a reality of that terrible thing he had already thought of , that hideously impossible possibility which she dared not even allow to present itself before her imagination ?
Parsing [sent. 4047 len. 16]: So he lay and moaned , and she sat crushed and speechless with despairing misery .
Parsing [sent. 4048 len. 32]: All at once Leopold sat straight up , his eyes fixed and flaming , his face white : he looked like a corpse possessed by a spirit of fear and horror .
Parsing [sent. 4049 len. 55]: Helen 's heart swelled into her throat , the muscles of her face contracted with irresistible rigor , and she felt it grow exactly like his , while with wide eyes she stared at him , and he stared at something which lest she also should see , she dared not turn her head .
Parsing [sent. 4050 len. 19]: Surely , she thought afterwards , she must have been that moment in the presence of something unearthly !
Parsing [sent. 4051 len. 31]: Her physical being was wrenched from her control , and she must simply sit and wait until the power or influence , whichever it might be , should pass away .
Parsing [sent. 4052 len. 24]: How long it was ere it relaxed its hold she could not tell ; it could not have been long , she thought .
Parsing [sent. 4053 len. 32]: Suddenly the light sank from Leopold 's eyes , his muscles relaxed , he fell back motionless , apparently senseless , on the pillow , and she thought he was dead .
Parsing [sent. 4054 len. 25]: The same moment she was free ; the horror had departed from her own atmosphere too , and she made haste to restore him .
Parsing [sent. 4055 len. 29]: But in all she did for him , she felt like the executioner who gives restoratives to the wretch that has fainted on the rack or the wheel .
Parsing [sent. 4056 len. 17]: What right had SHE , she thought , to multiply to him his moments of torture ?
Parsing [sent. 4057 len. 51]: If the cruel power that had created him for such misery , whoever , whatever , wherever he might be , chose thus to torture him , was she , his only friend , out of the selfish affection he had planted in her , to lend herself his tool ?
Parsing [sent. 4058 len. 11]: Yet she hesitated not a single moment in her ministrations .
Parsing [sent. 4059 len. 49]: There is so much passes in us of which our consciousness takes no grasp , -- or but with such a flitting touch as scarcely to hand it over to the memory -- that I feel encouraged to doubt whether ever there was a man absolutely without hope .
Parsing [sent. 4060 len. 49]: That there have been , alas , are many , who are aware of no ground of hope , nay even who feel no glimmer in them of anything they can call hope , I know ; but I think in them all is an underlying unconscious hope .
Parsing [sent. 4061 len. 20]: I think that not one in all the world has more than a shadowy notion of what hopelessness means .
Parsing [sent. 4062 len. 8]: Perhaps utter hopelessness is the outer darkness .
Parsing [sent. 4063 len. 28]: At length Leopold opened his eyes , gave a terrified glance around , held out his arms to her , and drew her down upon his face .
Parsing [sent. 4064 len. 6]: `` I saw her ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4065 len. 24]: he said , in a voice that sounded as if it came from the grave , and she heard it in her heart .
Parsing [sent. 4066 len. 6]: `` Nonsense , dear Poldie !
Parsing [sent. 4067 len. 39]: it was all fancy -- nothing more , '' she returned , in a voice almost as hollow as his ; and the lightness of the words uttered in such a tone jarred dismayfully on her own ear .
Parsing [sent. 4068 len. 4]: `` Fancy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4069 len. 23]: he repeated ; `` I know what fancy is as well as any man or woman born : THAT was no fancy .
Parsing [sent. 4070 len. 13]: She stood there , by the wardrobe -- in the same dress !
Parsing [sent. 4071 len. 9]: -- her face as white as her dress !
Parsing [sent. 4072 len. 4]: And -- listen !
Parsing [sent. 4073 len. 18]: -- I will tell YOU -- I will soon satisfy you it COULD be no fancy . ''
Parsing [sent. 4074 len. 14]: -- Here he pushed her from him and looked straight in her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4075 len. 53]: -- `` I saw her back reflected in the mirror of the wardrobe-door , and '' -- here the fixed look of horror threatened to return upon his face , but he went on -- `` listen , -- there was a worm crawling on it , over her lovely white shoulder !
Parsing [sent. 4076 len. 2]: Ugh !
Parsing [sent. 4077 len. 8]: I saw it in the mirror ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4078 len. 32]: His voice had risen to a strangled shriek , his face was distorted , and he shook like a child on the point of yelling aloud in an agony of fear .
Parsing [sent. 4079 len. 65]: Helen clasped his face between her hands , and gathering courage from despair , if indeed that be a possible source of courage , and it is not gathered rather from the hidden hope of which I speak , and the love that will cleave and not forsake , she set her teeth , and said : `` Let her come then , Poldie !
Parsing [sent. 4080 len. 10]: I am with you , and I defy her !
Parsing [sent. 4081 len. 24]: She shall know that a sister 's love is stronger than the hate of a jilt -- even if you did kill her .
Parsing [sent. 4082 len. 15]: Before God , Poldie , I would after all rather be you than she .
Parsing [sent. 4083 len. 29]: Say what you will , she had herself to blame , and I do n't doubt did twenty worse things than you did when you killed her . ''
Parsing [sent. 4084 len. 20]: But Leopold seemed not to hear a word she said , and lay with his face to the wall .
Parsing [sent. 4085 len. 37]: At length he turned his head suddenly , and said , `` Helen , if you do n't let me see Mr. Wingfold , I shall go mad , and then everything will come out . ''
Parsing [sent. 4086 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXIII .
Parsing [sent. 4087 len. 3]: COMPELLED CONFIDENCE .
Parsing [sent. 4088 len. 18]: Helen flew to the dressing-room to hide her dismay , and there cast herself on the bed .
Parsing [sent. 4089 len. 16]: The gray Fate above , or the awful Demo-gorgon beneath , would have its way !
Parsing [sent. 4090 len. 25]: Whether it was a living Will or but the shadow of the events it seemed to order , it was too much for her .
Parsing [sent. 4091 len. 7]: She had no choice but yield .
Parsing [sent. 4092 len. 8]: She rose and returned to her brother .
Parsing [sent. 4093 len. 23]: `` I am going to find Mr. Wingfold , '' she said in a hoarse voice , as she took her hat .
Parsing [sent. 4094 len. 13]: `` Do n't be long then , Helen , '' returned Leopold .
Parsing [sent. 4095 len. 11]: `` I ca n't bear you out of my sight .
Parsing [sent. 4096 len. 10]: And do n't let aunt come into the room .
Parsing [sent. 4097 len. 15]: SHE might come again , you know , and then all would be out .
Parsing [sent. 4098 len. 9]: -- Bring him with you , Helen . ''
Parsing [sent. 4099 len. 11]: `` I will , '' answered Helen , and went .
Parsing [sent. 4100 len. 15]: The curate might have returned : she would seek him first at his lodging .
Parsing [sent. 4101 len. 7]: She cared nothing about appearances now .
Parsing [sent. 4102 len. 6]: It was a dull afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 4103 len. 10]: Clouds had gathered , and the wind was chilly .
Parsing [sent. 4104 len. 26]: It seemed to blow out of the church , which stood up cold and gray against the sky , filling the end of the street .
Parsing [sent. 4105 len. 9]: What a wretched , horrible world it was !
Parsing [sent. 4106 len. 46]: She approached the church , and entered the churchyard from which it rose like a rock from the Dead Sea -- a type of the true church , around whose walls lie the dead bodies of the old selves left behind by those who enter .
Parsing [sent. 4107 len. 19]: Helen would have envied the dead , who lay so still under its waves ; but , alas !
Parsing [sent. 4108 len. 20]: if Leopold was right , they but roamed elsewhere in their trouble , and were no better for dying .
Parsing [sent. 4109 len. 37]: She hurried across , and reached the house ; but Mr. Wingfold had not yet returned , and she hurried back across it again , to tell Leopold that she must go farther to find him .
Parsing [sent. 4110 len. 8]: The poor youth was already more composed .
Parsing [sent. 4111 len. 12]: What will not the vaguest hope sometimes do for a man !
Parsing [sent. 4112 len. 35]: Helen told him she had seen the curate in the park , when she was out in the morning , and he might be there still , or she might meet him coming back .
Parsing [sent. 4113 len. 8]: Leopold only begged her to make haste .
Parsing [sent. 4114 len. 8]: She took the road to the lodge .
Parsing [sent. 4115 len. 18]: She did not meet him , and it was with intense repugnance that she approached the gate .
Parsing [sent. 4116 len. 7]: `` Is Mr. Wingfold here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4117 len. 43]: she asked of Rachel , as if she had never spoken to her before ; and Rachel , turning paler at the sight of her , answered that he was in the garden with her uncle , and went to call him .
Parsing [sent. 4118 len. 29]: The moment he appeared she said , in a tone rendered by conflicting emotions inexplicable , and sounding almost rude , `` Will you come to my brother ?
Parsing [sent. 4119 len. 12]: He is very ill , and wants to see you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4120 len. 17]: `` Certainly , '' returned Wingfold ; `` I will go with you at once . ''
Parsing [sent. 4121 len. 29]: But in his heart he trembled at the thought of being looked to for consolation and counsel , and that apparently in a case of no ordinary kind .
Parsing [sent. 4122 len. 16]: Most likely he would not know what to say , or how to behave himself !
Parsing [sent. 4123 len. 24]: How different it would be if with all his heart he believed the grand lovely things recorded in the book of his profession !
Parsing [sent. 4124 len. 26]: Then indeed he might enter the chambers of pain and fear and guilt with the innocent confidence of a winged angel of comfort and healing !
Parsing [sent. 4125 len. 24]: But now the eyes of his understanding were blinded with the IFS and BUTS that flew swarming like black muscae wherever they turned .
Parsing [sent. 4126 len. 14]: Still he would -- nay , he must go and do his best .
Parsing [sent. 4127 len. 22]: They walked across the park to reach the house by the garden , and for some distance they walked in silence .
Parsing [sent. 4128 len. 39]: At length Helen said : `` You must not encourage my brother to talk much , if you please ; and you must not mind what he says ; he has had brain-fever , and sometimes talks strangely .
Parsing [sent. 4129 len. 30]: But on the other hand , if he fancy you do n't believe him , it will drive him wild -- so you must take care -- please . ''
Parsing [sent. 4130 len. 15]: Her voice was like that of a soul trying to speak with unproved lips .
Parsing [sent. 4131 len. 51]: `` Miss Lingard , '' said Wingfold , slowly and quietly -- and if his voice trembled , he only was aware of it , `` I can not see your face , therefore you must pardon me if I ask you -- are you quite honest with me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4132 len. 7]: Helen 's first feeling was anger .
Parsing [sent. 4133 len. 8]: She held her peace for a time .
Parsing [sent. 4134 len. 10]: Then she said , `` So , Mr. Wingfold !
Parsing [sent. 4135 len. 11]: -- that is the way you help the helpless ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4136 len. 15]: `` How can any man help without knowing what has to be helped ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4137 len. 4]: returned the curate .
Parsing [sent. 4138 len. 14]: `` The very being of his help depends upon his knowing the truth .
Parsing [sent. 4139 len. 28]: It is very plain you do not trust me , and equally impossible I should be of any service as long as the case is such . ''
Parsing [sent. 4140 len. 6]: Again Helen held her peace .
Parsing [sent. 4141 len. 17]: Resentment and dislike towards himself combined with terror of his anticipated counsel to render her speechless .
Parsing [sent. 4142 len. 26]: Her silence lasted so long that Wingfold came to the resolution of making a venture that had occurred to him more than once that morning .
Parsing [sent. 4143 len. 24]: Had he not been convinced that a soul was in dire misery , he would not have had recourse to the seeming cruelty .
Parsing [sent. 4144 len. 25]: `` Would this help to satisfy you that , whatever my advice may be worth , at least my discretion may be trusted ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4145 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 4146 len. 40]: They were at the moment passing through a little thicket in the park , where nobody could see them , and as he spoke , he took the knife-sheath from his pocket , and held it out to her .
Parsing [sent. 4147 len. 23]: She started like a young horse at something dead : she had never seen it , but the shape had an association .
Parsing [sent. 4148 len. 73]: She paled , retreated a step , with a drawing back of her head and neck and a spreading of her nostrils , stared for a moment , first at the sheath , then at the curate , gave a little moan , bit her under lip hard , held out her hand , but as if she were afraid to touch the thing , and said : `` What is it ?
Parsing [sent. 4149 len. 7]: Where did you find it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4150 len. 12]: She would have taken it , but Wingfold held it fast .
Parsing [sent. 4151 len. 10]: `` Give it me , '' she said imperatively .
Parsing [sent. 4152 len. 5]: `` It is mine .
Parsing [sent. 4153 len. 5]: I lost it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4154 len. 23]: `` There is something dark on the lining of it , '' said the curate , and looked straight into her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4155 len. 6]: She let go her hold .
Parsing [sent. 4156 len. 31]: But almost the same moment she snatched the sheath out of his hand and held it to her bosom , while her look of terror changed into one of defiance .
Parsing [sent. 4157 len. 8]: Wingfold made no attempt to recover it .
Parsing [sent. 4158 len. 12]: She put it in her pocket , and drew herself up .
Parsing [sent. 4159 len. 7]: `` What do you mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4160 len. 12]: she said , in a voice that was hard yet trembled .
Parsing [sent. 4161 len. 20]: She felt like one that sees the vultures gathering above him , and lifts a moveable finger in defence .
Parsing [sent. 4162 len. 21]: Then with sudden haughtiness both of gesture and word : `` You have been acting the spy , sir ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4163 len. 9]: `` No , '' returned the curate quietly .
Parsing [sent. 4164 len. 30]: `` The sheath was committed to my care by one whom certain facts that had come to his knowledge -- certain words he had overheard -- '' He paused .
Parsing [sent. 4165 len. 16]: She shook visibly , but still would hold what ground might yet be left her .
Parsing [sent. 4166 len. 11]: `` Why did you not give it me before ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4167 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 4168 len. 14]: `` In the public street , or in your aunt 's presence ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4169 len. 6]: `` You are cruel ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4170 len. 3]: she panted .
Parsing [sent. 4171 len. 5]: Her strength was going .
Parsing [sent. 4172 len. 7]: `` What do you know ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4173 len. 19]: `` Nothing so well as that I want to serve you , and you may trust me . ''
Parsing [sent. 4174 len. 9]: `` What do you mean to do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4175 len. 11]: `` My best to help you and your brother . ''
Parsing [sent. 4176 len. 7]: `` But to what end ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4177 len. 9]: `` To any end that is right . ''
Parsing [sent. 4178 len. 4]: `` But how ?
Parsing [sent. 4179 len. 9]: What would you tell him to do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4180 len. 14]: `` You must help me to discover what he ought to do . ''
Parsing [sent. 4181 len. 30]: `` Not -- '' she cried , clasping her hands and dropping on her knees before him , '' -- you WILL not tell him to give himself up ?
Parsing [sent. 4182 len. 13]: Promise me you will not , and I will tell you everything .
Parsing [sent. 4183 len. 9]: He shall do anything you please but that !
Parsing [sent. 4184 len. 5]: Anything but that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4185 len. 11]: Wingfold 's heart was sore at sight of her agony .
Parsing [sent. 4186 len. 31]: He would have raised her with soothing words of sympathy and assurance , but still she cried , `` Promise me you will not make him give himself up . ''
Parsing [sent. 4187 len. 8]: `` I dare not promise anything . ''
Parsing [sent. 4188 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 4189 len. 12]: `` I MUST do what I may see to be right .
Parsing [sent. 4190 len. 54]: Believe me , I have no wish to force myself into your confidence , but you have let me see that you are in great trouble and in need of help , and I should be unfaithful to my calling if I did not do my best to make you trust me . ''
Parsing [sent. 4191 len. 4]: A pause followed .
Parsing [sent. 4192 len. 10]: Helen rose despairingly , and they resumed their walk .
Parsing [sent. 4193 len. 39]: Just as they reached the door in the fence which would let them out upon the meadow in sight of the Manor-house , she turned to him and said , `` I will trust you , Mr. Wingfold .
Parsing [sent. 4194 len. 21]: I mean , I will take you to my brother , and he shall do as he thinks proper . ''
Parsing [sent. 4195 len. 11]: They passed out and walked across the meadow in silence .
Parsing [sent. 4196 len. 27]: In the passage under the fence , as she turned from closing the door behind them , she stood and pressed her hand to her side .
Parsing [sent. 4197 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 4198 len. 13]: Mr. Wingfold , '' she cried , `` my heart will break !
Parsing [sent. 4199 len. 7]: He has no one but me !
Parsing [sent. 4200 len. 14]: No one but me to be mother and sister and all to him !
Parsing [sent. 4201 len. 10]: He is NOT wicked -- my poor darling ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4202 len. 58]: She caught the curate by the arm with a grasp which left its mark behind it , and gazed appealingly into his face : in the dim tomb-like light , her wide-strained eyes , white agonized countenance , and trembling roseless lips made her look like one called back from death `` to speak of horrors . ''
Parsing [sent. 4203 len. 16]: `` Save him from madness , '' she said , in forced and unnatural utterance .
Parsing [sent. 4204 len. 11]: `` Save him from the remorse gnawing at his heart .
Parsing [sent. 4205 len. 14]: But do not , DO not counsel him to give himself up . ''
Parsing [sent. 4206 len. 28]: `` Would it not be better you should tell me about it , '' said the curate , `` and save him the pain and excitement ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4207 len. 14]: `` I will do so , if he wishes it , not otherwise .
Parsing [sent. 4208 len. 8]: Come ; we must not stay longer .
Parsing [sent. 4209 len. 10]: He can hardly bear me out of his sight .
Parsing [sent. 4210 len. 17]: I will leave you for one moment in the library , and then come to you .
Parsing [sent. 4211 len. 16]: If you should see my aunt , not a word of all this , please .
Parsing [sent. 4212 len. 17]: All she knows is that he has had brain-fever , and is recovering only very slowly .
Parsing [sent. 4213 len. 12]: I have never given her even a hint of anything worse .
Parsing [sent. 4214 len. 22]: Indeed , honestly , Mr. Wingfold , I am not at all certain he did do what he will tell you .
Parsing [sent. 4215 len. 9]: But there is his misery all the same .
Parsing [sent. 4216 len. 16]: Do have pity on us , and do n't be hard upon the poor boy .
Parsing [sent. 4217 len. 10]: He is but a boy -- only twenty . ''
Parsing [sent. 4218 len. 13]: `` May God be to me as I am to him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4219 len. 4]: said Wingfold solemnly .
Parsing [sent. 4220 len. 12]: Helen withdrew her entreating eyes , and let go his arm .
Parsing [sent. 4221 len. 11]: They went up into the garden and into the house .
Parsing [sent. 4222 len. 34]: Afterwards , Wingfold was astonished at his own calmness and decision in taking upon him -- almost , as it were , dragging to him -- this relation with Helen and her brother .
Parsing [sent. 4223 len. 39]: But he had felt that not to do so would be to abandon Helen to her grief , and that for her sake he must not hesitate to encounter whatever might have to be encountered in doing so .
Parsing [sent. 4224 len. 42]: Helen left him in the library , as she had said , and there he waited her return in a kind of stupor , unable to think , and feeling as if he were lost in a strange and anxious dream .
Parsing [sent. 4225 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXIV .
Parsing [sent. 4226 len. 3]: WILLING CONFIDENCE .
Parsing [sent. 4227 len. 17]: `` Come , '' said Helen , re-entering , and the curate rose and followed her .
Parsing [sent. 4228 len. 50]: The moment he turned the corner of the bed and saw the face on the pillow , he knew in his soul that Helen was right , and that that was no wicked youth who lay before him -- one , however , who might well have been passion-driven .
Parsing [sent. 4229 len. 18]: There was the dark complexion and the great soft yet wild eyes that came of tropical blood .
Parsing [sent. 4230 len. 23]: Had not Helen so plainly spoken of her brother , however , he would have thought he saw before him a woman .
Parsing [sent. 4231 len. 24]: The worn , troubled , appealing light that overflowed rather than shone from his eyes , went straight to the curate 's heart .
Parsing [sent. 4232 len. 57]: Wingfold had had a brother , the only being in the world he had ever loved tenderly ; he had died young , and a thin film of ice had since gathered over the well of his affections ; but now suddenly this ice broke and vanished , and his heart yearned over the suffering youth .
Parsing [sent. 4233 len. 40]: He had himself been crying to God , not seldom in sore trouble , and now , ere , as it seemed , he had himself been heard , here was a sad brother crying to him for help .
Parsing [sent. 4234 len. 71]: Nor was this all ; the reading of the gospel story had roused in his heart a strange yet most natural longing after the face of that man of whom he read such lovely things , and thence , unknown to himself , had come a reverence and a love for his kind , which now first sprang awake to his consciousness in the feeling that drew him towards Leopold .
Parsing [sent. 4235 len. 15]: Softly he approached the bed , his face full of tenderness and strong pity .
Parsing [sent. 4236 len. 27]: The lad , weak with protracted illness and mental torture , gave one look in his face , and stretched out both his arms to him .
Parsing [sent. 4237 len. 10]: How could the curate give him but a hand ?
Parsing [sent. 4238 len. 14]: He put his arms round him as if he had been a child .
Parsing [sent. 4239 len. 11]: `` I knew you would come , '' sobbed Lingard .
Parsing [sent. 4240 len. 10]: `` What else should I do but come ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4241 len. 3]: returned Wingfold .
Parsing [sent. 4242 len. 23]: `` I have seen you somewhere before , '' said Lingard -- `` in one of my dreams , I suppose . ''
Parsing [sent. 4243 len. 23]: Then , sinking his voice to a whisper , he added : `` Do you know you came in close behind HER ?
Parsing [sent. 4244 len. 11]: She looked round and saw you , and vanished ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4245 len. 11]: Wingfold did not even try to guess at his meaning .
Parsing [sent. 4246 len. 8]: `` Hush , my dear fellow ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4247 len. 22]: he said ; `` I must not let you talk wildly , or the doctor might forbid my seeing you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4248 len. 13]: `` I am not talking a bit wildly , '' returned Leopold .
Parsing [sent. 4249 len. 9]: `` I am as quiet as a mountain-top .
Parsing [sent. 4250 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 4251 len. 17]: when I AM wild -- if you saw me then , you might say so ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4252 len. 27]: Wingfold sat down on the side of the bed , and took the thin , hot hand next him in his own firm , cool one .
Parsing [sent. 4253 len. 15]: `` Come now , '' he said , `` tell me all about it .
Parsing [sent. 4254 len. 7]: Or shall your sister tell me ?
Parsing [sent. 4255 len. 10]: -- Come here , please , Miss Lingard . ''
Parsing [sent. 4256 len. 6]: `` No , no ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4257 len. 11]: cried Leopold hastily ; `` I will tell you myself .
Parsing [sent. 4258 len. 11]: My poor sister could not bear to tell it you .
Parsing [sent. 4259 len. 5]: It would kill her .
Parsing [sent. 4260 len. 27]: -- But how am I to know you will not get up and walk out the moment you have a glimpse of what is coming ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4261 len. 25]: `` I would as soon leave a child burning in the fire , and go out and shut the door , '' said Wingfold .
Parsing [sent. 4262 len. 14]: `` You can go now , Helen , '' said Lingard very quietly .
Parsing [sent. 4263 len. 9]: `` Why should you be tortured over again ?
Parsing [sent. 4264 len. 7]: You need n't mind leaving me .
Parsing [sent. 4265 len. 9]: Mr. Wingfold will take care of me . ''
Parsing [sent. 4266 len. 16]: Helen left the room , with one anxious look at her brother as she went .
Parsing [sent. 4267 len. 39]: Without a moment 's further delay , Leopold began , and in wonderfully direct and unbroken narrative , told the sad evil tale as he had formerly told it to his sister , only more consecutively and quietly .
Parsing [sent. 4268 len. 33]: Possibly his anxiety as to how the listener would receive it , served , by dividing him between two emotions , to keep the reuttered tale from overpowering him with freshened vividness .
Parsing [sent. 4269 len. 26]: All the time , he kept watching Wingfold 's face , the expressions of which the curate felt those eyes were reading like a book .
Parsing [sent. 4270 len. 36]: He was so well prepared , however , that no expression of surprise , no reflex of its ghastfulness met Leopold 's gaze , and he went on to the end without a pause even .
Parsing [sent. 4271 len. 34]: When he had finished , both sat silent , looking in each other 's eyes , Wingfold 's beaming with compassion , and Lingard 's glimmering with doubtful , anxious inquiry and appeal .
Parsing [sent. 4272 len. 18]: At length Wingfold said : `` And what do you think I can do for you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4273 len. 6]: `` I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 4274 len. 8]: I thought you could tell me something .
Parsing [sent. 4275 len. 7]: I can not live like this !
Parsing [sent. 4276 len. 17]: If I had but thought before I did it , and killed myself instead of her !
Parsing [sent. 4277 len. 8]: It would have done so much better !
Parsing [sent. 4278 len. 22]: Of course I should be in hell now , but that would be all right , and this is all wrong .
Parsing [sent. 4279 len. 14]: I have no right to be lying here and Emmeline in her grave .
Parsing [sent. 4280 len. 40]: I know I deserve to be miserable for ever and ever , and I do n't want not to be miserable -- that is all right -- but there is something in this wretchedness that I can not bear .
Parsing [sent. 4281 len. 12]: Tell me something to make me able to endure my misery .
Parsing [sent. 4282 len. 9]: That is what you can do for me .
Parsing [sent. 4283 len. 8]: I do n't want to go mad .
Parsing [sent. 4284 len. 23]: And what is worst of all , I have made my sister miserable , and I ca n't bear to see it .
Parsing [sent. 4285 len. 7]: She is wasting away with it .
Parsing [sent. 4286 len. 19]: And besides I fancy she loves George Bascombe -- and who would marry the sister of a murderer ?
Parsing [sent. 4287 len. 19]: And now she has begun to come to me again -- in the daytime -- I mean Emmeline !
Parsing [sent. 4288 len. 39]: -- or I have begun to see her again -- I do n't know which ; -- perhaps she is always there , only I do n't always see her -- and it do n't much matter which .
Parsing [sent. 4289 len. 9]: Only if other people were to see her !
Parsing [sent. 4290 len. 26]: -- While she is there nothing could persuade me I do not see her , but afterwards I am not so sure that I did .
Parsing [sent. 4291 len. 35]: And at night I keep dreaming the horrible thing over and over again ; and the agony is to think I shall never get rid of it , and never never feel clean again .
Parsing [sent. 4292 len. 22]: To be for ever and ever a murderer and people not know it , is more than I CAN bear . ''
Parsing [sent. 4293 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXV .
Parsing [sent. 4294 len. 5]: THE CURATE 'S COUNSEL .
Parsing [sent. 4295 len. 38]: Not seeing yet what he had to say , but knowing that scintillation the smallest is light , the curate let the talk take its natural course , and said the next thing that came to him .
Parsing [sent. 4296 len. 17]: `` How do you feel when you think that you may yet be found out ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4297 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 4298 len. 14]: `` At first I was more afraid of that than of anything else .
Parsing [sent. 4299 len. 16]: Then after that danger seemed past , I was afraid of the life to come .
Parsing [sent. 4300 len. 19]: That fear left me next , and now it is the thing itself that is always haunting me .
Parsing [sent. 4301 len. 16]: I often wish they would come and take me , and deliver me from myself .
Parsing [sent. 4302 len. 18]: It would be a comfort to have it all known , and never need to start again .
Parsing [sent. 4303 len. 13]: I think I could even bear to see her in the prison .
Parsing [sent. 4304 len. 24]: If it would annihilate the deed , or bring Emmeline back , I can not tell you how gladly I would be hanged .
Parsing [sent. 4305 len. 8]: I would , indeed , Mr. Wingfold .
Parsing [sent. 4306 len. 16]: I I hope you will believe me , though I do n't deserve it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4307 len. 16]: `` I do believe you , '' said the curate , and a silence followed .
Parsing [sent. 4308 len. 35]: `` There is but one thing I can say with confidence at this moment , '' he resumed : `` it is , that I am your friend , and will stand by you .
Parsing [sent. 4309 len. 36]: But the first part of friendship sometimes is to confess poverty , and I want to tell you that , of the very things concerning which I ought to know most , I knew least .
Parsing [sent. 4310 len. 32]: I have but lately begun to feel after God , and I dare not say that I have found him , but I think I know now where to find him .
Parsing [sent. 4311 len. 17]: And I do think , if we could find him , then we should find help .
Parsing [sent. 4312 len. 38]: All I can do for you now is only to be near you , and talk to you , and pray to God for you , that so together we may wait for what light may come .
Parsing [sent. 4313 len. 17]: -- Does anything ever look to you as if it would make you feel better ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4314 len. 15]: `` I have no right to feel better or take comfort from anything . ''
Parsing [sent. 4315 len. 8]: `` I am not sure about that .
Parsing [sent. 4316 len. 15]: -- Do you feel any better for having me come to see you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4317 len. 10]: `` Oh , yes , indeed I do ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4318 len. 14]: `` Well , there is no wrong in that , is there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4319 len. 6]: `` I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 4320 len. 15]: It seems a sneaking kind of thing : she has got none of it .
Parsing [sent. 4321 len. 24]: My sister makes excuses for me , but the moment I begin to listen to them I only feel the more horrid . ''
Parsing [sent. 4322 len. 12]: `` I have said nothing of that kind to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4323 len. 6]: `` No , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 4324 len. 11]: `` And yet you like to have me here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4325 len. 13]: `` Yes , indeed , sir , '' he answered , earnestly .
Parsing [sent. 4326 len. 14]: `` And it does not make you think less of your crime ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4327 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 4328 len. 31]: It makes me feel it worse than ever to see you sitting there , a clean , strong , innocent man , and think what I might have been . ''
Parsing [sent. 4329 len. 16]: `` Then the comfort you get from me does you no harm , at least .
Parsing [sent. 4330 len. 25]: If I were to find my company made you think with less hatred of your crime , I should go away that instant . ''
Parsing [sent. 4331 len. 11]: `` Thank you , sir , '' said Leopold humbly .
Parsing [sent. 4332 len. 6]: `` Oh , sir ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4333 len. 32]: he resumed after a little silence , '' -- to think that never more to all eternity shall I be able to think of myself as I used to think ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4334 len. 16]: `` Perhaps you used to think too much of yourself , '' returned the curate .
Parsing [sent. 4335 len. 32]: `` For the greatest fool and rascal in creation there is yet a worse condition , and that is -- not to know it , but think himself a respectable man .
Parsing [sent. 4336 len. 24]: As the event proves , though you would doubtless have laughed at the idea , you were then capable of committing a murder .
Parsing [sent. 4337 len. 43]: I have come to see -- at least I think I have -- that except a man has God dwelling in him , he may be , or may become , capable of any crime within the compass of human nature . ''
Parsing [sent. 4338 len. 13]: `` I do n't know anything about God , '' said Leopold .
Parsing [sent. 4339 len. 41]: `` I daresay I thought I did before this happened -- before I did it , I mean , '' he added in correction , '' -- but I know now that I do n't , and never did . ''
Parsing [sent. 4340 len. 6]: `` Ah , Leopold ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4341 len. 30]: said the curate , `` think , if my coming to you comforts you , what would it be to have him who made you always with you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4342 len. 7]: `` Where would be the good ?
Parsing [sent. 4343 len. 25]: I daresay he might forgive me , if I were to do this and that , but where would be the good of it ?
Parsing [sent. 4344 len. 12]: It would not take the thing off me one bit . ''
Parsing [sent. 4345 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 4346 len. 28]: now , '' said Wingfold , `` I fear you are thinking a little about your own disgrace and not only of the bad you have done .
Parsing [sent. 4347 len. 7]: Why should you not be ashamed ?
Parsing [sent. 4348 len. 10]: Why would you have the shame taken off you ?
Parsing [sent. 4349 len. 10]: Nay ; you must humbly consent to bear it .
Parsing [sent. 4350 len. 15]: Perhaps your shame is the hand of love washing the defilement from off you .
Parsing [sent. 4351 len. 15]: Let us keep our shame , and be made clean from the filth ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4352 len. 12]: `` I do n't know that I understand you , sir .
Parsing [sent. 4353 len. 8]: What do you mean by the defilement ?
Parsing [sent. 4354 len. 14]: Is it not to have done the deed that is the defilement ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4355 len. 31]: `` Is it not rather to have that in you , a part , or all but a part of your being , that makes you capable of doing it ?
Parsing [sent. 4356 len. 33]: If you had resisted and conquered , you would have been clean from it ; and now , if you repent and God comes to you , you will yet be clean .
Parsing [sent. 4357 len. 14]: Again I say , let us keep our shame and be made clean !
Parsing [sent. 4358 len. 13]: Shame is not defilement , though a mean pride persuades men so .
Parsing [sent. 4359 len. 17]: On the contrary , the man who is honestly ashamed has begun to be clean . ''
Parsing [sent. 4360 len. 10]: `` But what good would that do to Emmeline ?
Parsing [sent. 4361 len. 18]: It can not bring her up again to the bright world out of the dark grave . ''
Parsing [sent. 4362 len. 10]: `` Emmeline is not in the dark grave . ''
Parsing [sent. 4363 len. 8]: `` Where is she , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4364 len. 7]: he said with a ghastly look .
Parsing [sent. 4365 len. 7]: `` That I can not tell .
Parsing [sent. 4366 len. 22]: I only know that , if there be a God , she is in his hands , '' replied the curate .
Parsing [sent. 4367 len. 12]: The youth gazed on in his face and made no answer .
Parsing [sent. 4368 len. 21]: Wingfold saw that he had been wrong in trying to comfort him with the thought of God dwelling in him .
Parsing [sent. 4369 len. 14]: How was such a poor passionate creature to take that for a comfort ?
Parsing [sent. 4370 len. 19]: How was he to understand or prize the idea , who had his spiritual nature so all undeveloped ?
Parsing [sent. 4371 len. 6]: He would try another way .
Parsing [sent. 4372 len. 25]: `` Shall I tell you what seems to me sometimes the only one thing I want to help me out of my difficulties ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4373 len. 17]: `` Yes , please , sir , '' answered Leopold , as humbly as a child .
Parsing [sent. 4374 len. 20]: `` I think sometimes , if I could but see Jesus for one moment -- '' `` Ah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4375 len. 9]: cried Leopold , and gave a great sigh .
Parsing [sent. 4376 len. 13]: ` YOU would like to see him then , would you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4377 len. 7]: `` Oh , Mr. Wingfold ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4378 len. 13]: `` What would you say to him if you saw him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4379 len. 6]: `` I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 4380 len. 20]: I would fall down on my face and hold his feet lest he should go away from me . ''
Parsing [sent. 4381 len. 11]: `` Do you think then he could help you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4382 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 4383 len. 7]: He could make Emmeline alive again .
Parsing [sent. 4384 len. 9]: He could destroy what I have done . ''
Parsing [sent. 4385 len. 14]: `` But still , as you say , the crime would remain . ''
Parsing [sent. 4386 len. 24]: `` But , as you say , he could pardon that , and make me that I would never never sin again . ''
Parsing [sent. 4387 len. 13]: `` So you think the story about Jesus Christ is true ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4388 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 4389 len. 5]: Do n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4390 len. 9]: said Leopold with an amazed , half-frightened look .
Parsing [sent. 4391 len. 7]: `` Yes , indeed I do .
Parsing [sent. 4392 len. 30]: -- Then do you remember what he said to his disciples as he left them : ' I AM WITH YOU ALWAYS UNTO THE END OF THE WORLD ' ?
Parsing [sent. 4393 len. 20]: -- If that be true , then he can hear you just as well now as ever he could .
Parsing [sent. 4394 len. 31]: And when he was in the world , he said , ` COME UNTO ME ALL YE THAT LABOUR AND ARE HEAVY-LADEN , AND I WILL GIVE YOU REST . '
Parsing [sent. 4395 len. 33]: It is rest you want , my poor boy -- not deliverance from danger or shame , but rest -- such peace of mind as you had when you were a child .
Parsing [sent. 4396 len. 20]: If he can not give you that , I know not where or how it is to be had .
Parsing [sent. 4397 len. 28]: Do not waste time in asking yourself how he can do it : that is for him to understand , not you -- until it is done .
Parsing [sent. 4398 len. 16]: Ask him to forgive you and make you clean and set things right for you .
Parsing [sent. 4399 len. 23]: If he will not do it , then he is not the saviour of men , and was wrongly named Jesus . ''
Parsing [sent. 4400 len. 4]: The curate rose .
Parsing [sent. 4401 len. 6]: Leopold had hid his face .
Parsing [sent. 4402 len. 8]: When he looked again he was gone .
Parsing [sent. 4403 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXVI .
Parsing [sent. 4404 len. 2]: SLEEP .
Parsing [sent. 4405 len. 37]: As Wingfold came out of the room , which was near the stair , Helen rose from the top of it , where she had been sitting all the time he had been with her brother .
Parsing [sent. 4406 len. 15]: He closed the door gently behind him , and stepped softly along the landing .
Parsing [sent. 4407 len. 90]: A human soul in guilt and agony is an awful presence , but there was more than that in the hush of the curate : he felt as if he had left the physician of souls behind him at the bedside ; that a human being lay on the rack of the truth , but at his head stood one who watched his throes with the throbs of such a human heart as never beat in any bosom but his own , and the executioners were angels of light .
Parsing [sent. 4408 len. 19]: No wonder if with such a feeling in his breast Wingfold walked softly , and his face glistened !
Parsing [sent. 4409 len. 17]: He was not aware that the tears stood in his eyes , but Helen saw them .
Parsing [sent. 4410 len. 6]: `` You know all ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4411 len. 3]: she faltered .
Parsing [sent. 4412 len. 4]: `` I do .
Parsing [sent. 4413 len. 10]: Will you let me out by the garden again ?
Parsing [sent. 4414 len. 7]: I wish to be alone . ''
Parsing [sent. 4415 len. 16]: She led the way down the stair , and walked with him through the garden .
Parsing [sent. 4416 len. 5]: Wingfold did not speak .
Parsing [sent. 4417 len. 19]: `` You do n't think very badly of my poor brother , do you , Mr. Wingfold ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4418 len. 5]: said Helen , meekly .
Parsing [sent. 4419 len. 11]: `` It is a terrible fate , '' he returned .
Parsing [sent. 4420 len. 10]: `` I think I never saw a lovelier disposition .
Parsing [sent. 4421 len. 11]: I do hope his mind will soon be more composed .
Parsing [sent. 4422 len. 11]: I think he knows where alone he can find rest .
Parsing [sent. 4423 len. 88]: I am well aware how foolish that of which I speak seems to some minds , Miss Lingard ; but when a man is once overwhelmed in his own deeds , when they have turned into spectres to mock at him , when he loathes himself and turns with sickness from past , present , and future , I know but one choice left , and that is between the death your friend Mr. Bascombe preaches , and the life preached by Jesus , the crucified Jew .
Parsing [sent. 4424 len. 11]: Into the life I hope your brother will enter . ''
Parsing [sent. 4425 len. 12]: `` I am so glad you do n't hate him . ''
Parsing [sent. 4426 len. 4]: `` Hate him !
Parsing [sent. 4427 len. 9]: Who but a demon could hate him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4428 len. 12]: Helen lifted a grateful look from eyes that swam in tears .
Parsing [sent. 4429 len. 11]: The terror of his possible counsel for the moment vanished .
Parsing [sent. 4430 len. 10]: He could never tell him to give himself up !
Parsing [sent. 4431 len. 36]: `` But , as I told you , I am a poor scholar in these high matters , '' resumed the curate , `` and I want to bring Mr. Polwarth to see him . ''
Parsing [sent. 4432 len. 5]: `` The dwarf ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4433 len. 17]: exclaimed Helen , shuddering at the remembrance of what she had gone through at the cottage .
Parsing [sent. 4434 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 4435 len. 21]: That man 's soul is as grand and beautiful and patient as his body is insignificant and distorted and troubled .
Parsing [sent. 4436 len. 12]: He is the wisest and best man I have ever known .
Parsing [sent. 4437 len. 32]: `` I must ask Leopold , '' returned Helen , who , the better the man was represented , felt the more jealous and fearful of the advice he might give .
Parsing [sent. 4438 len. 14]: Her love and her conscience were not yet at one with each other .
Parsing [sent. 4439 len. 16]: They parted at the door from the garden , and she returned to the sick-room .
Parsing [sent. 4440 len. 7]: She paused , hesitating to enter .
Parsing [sent. 4441 len. 7]: All was still as the grave .
Parsing [sent. 4442 len. 42]: She turned the handle softly and peeped in : could it be that Wingfold 's bearing had communicated to her mind a shadow of the awe with which he had left the place where perhaps a soul was being born again ?
Parsing [sent. 4443 len. 5]: Leopold did not move .
Parsing [sent. 4444 len. 7]: Terror laid hold of her heart .
Parsing [sent. 4445 len. 16]: She stepped quickly in , and round the screen to the side of the bed .
Parsing [sent. 4446 len. 22]: There , to her glad surprise , he lay fast asleep , with the tears not yet dried upon his face .
Parsing [sent. 4447 len. 20]: Her heart swelled with some sense unknown before : was it rudimentary thankfulness to the Father of her spirit ?
Parsing [sent. 4448 len. 26]: As she stood gazing with the look of a mother over her sick child , he lifted his eyelids , and smiled a sad smile .
Parsing [sent. 4449 len. 10]: `` When did you come into the room ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4450 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 4451 len. 9]: `` A minute ago , '' she answered .
Parsing [sent. 4452 len. 11]: `` I did not hear you , '' he returned .
Parsing [sent. 4453 len. 8]: `` No , you were asleep . ''
Parsing [sent. 4454 len. 4]: `` Not I !
Parsing [sent. 4455 len. 8]: Mr. Wingfold is only just gone . ''
Parsing [sent. 4456 len. 12]: `` I have let him out on the meadow since . ''
Parsing [sent. 4457 len. 21]: Leopold stared , looked half alarmed , and then said , `` Did God make me sleep , Helen ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4458 len. 5]: She did not answer .
Parsing [sent. 4459 len. 32]: The light of a new hope in his eye , as if the dawn had begun at last to break over the dark mountains , was already reflected from her heart .
Parsing [sent. 4460 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 4461 len. 19]: Helen , '' he said , `` that IS a good fellow , SUCH a good fellow ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4462 len. 33]: A pang of jealousy , the first she had ever felt , shot to her heart : she had hitherto , since his trouble , been all in all to her Leopold !
Parsing [sent. 4463 len. 19]: Had the curate been a man she liked , she would not perhaps have minded it so much .
Parsing [sent. 4464 len. 16]: `` You will be able to do without me now , '' she said sadly .
Parsing [sent. 4465 len. 13]: `` I never could understand taking to people at first sight ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4466 len. 12]: `` Some people are made so , I suppose , Helen .
Parsing [sent. 4467 len. 10]: I know I took to you at first sight !
Parsing [sent. 4468 len. 77]: I shall never forget the first time I saw you -- when I came to this country a lonely little foreigner , -- and you , a great beautiful lady , for such you seemed to me , though you have told me since you were only a great gawky girl -- I know that could never have been -- you ran to meet me , and took me in your arms , and kissed me .
Parsing [sent. 4469 len. 18]: I was as if I had crossed the sea of death and found paradise in your bosom !
Parsing [sent. 4470 len. 20]: I am not likely to forget you for Mr. Wingfold , good and kind and strong as he is !
Parsing [sent. 4471 len. 11]: Even SHE could not make me forget you , Helen .
Parsing [sent. 4472 len. 16]: But neither you nor I can do without Mr. Wingfold any more , I fancy .
Parsing [sent. 4473 len. 7]: I wish you liked him better !
Parsing [sent. 4474 len. 7]: -- but you will in time .
Parsing [sent. 4475 len. 48]: You see he 's not one to pay young ladies compliments , as I have heard some parsons do ; and he may be a little -- no , not unpolished , not that -- that 's not what I mean -- but unornamental in his manners !
Parsing [sent. 4476 len. 44]: Only , you see , -- '' `` Only , you see , Poldie , '' interrupted Helen , with a smile , a rare thing between them , `` you know all about him , though you never saw him before . ''
Parsing [sent. 4477 len. 27]: `` That is true , '' returned Leopold ; `` but then he came to me with his door open , and let me walk in .
Parsing [sent. 4478 len. 11]: It does n't take long to know a man then .
Parsing [sent. 4479 len. 17]: He has n't got a secret like us , Helen , '' he added , sadly .
Parsing [sent. 4480 len. 9]: `` What did he say to you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4481 len. 19]: `` Much what he said to you from the pulpit the other day , I should think . ''
Parsing [sent. 4482 len. 5]: Then she was right !
Parsing [sent. 4483 len. 39]: For all his hardness and want of sympathy , the curate had yet had regard to her entreaties , and was not going to put any horrid notions about duty and self-sacrifice into the poor boy 's head !
Parsing [sent. 4484 len. 32]: `` He 's coming again to-morrow , '' added Leopold , almost gleefully , `` and then perhaps he will tell me more , and help me on a bit ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4485 len. 15]: `` Did he tell you he wants to bring a friend with him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4486 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 4487 len. 16]: `` I ca n't see the good of taking more people into our confidence . ''
Parsing [sent. 4488 len. 13]: `` Why should he not do what he thinks best , Helen ?
Parsing [sent. 4489 len. 14]: You do n't interfere with the doctor -- why should you with him ?
Parsing [sent. 4490 len. 37]: When a man is going to the bottom as fast as he can , and another comes diving after him -- it is n't for me to say how he is to take hold of me .
Parsing [sent. 4491 len. 15]: No , Helen ; when I trust , I trust out and out . ''
Parsing [sent. 4492 len. 12]: Helen sighed , thinking how ill that had worked with Emmeline .
Parsing [sent. 4493 len. 48]: Ever since George Bascombe had talked about the Polwarths that day they met him in the park , she had felt a sort of physical horror of them , as if they were some kind of unclean creature that ought not to be in existence at all .
Parsing [sent. 4494 len. 29]: But when Leopold uttered himself thus , she felt that the current of events had seized her , and that she could only submit to be carried along .
Parsing [sent. 4495 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXVII .
Parsing [sent. 4496 len. 3]: DIVINE SERVICE .
Parsing [sent. 4497 len. 10]: The next day the curate called again on Leopold .
Parsing [sent. 4498 len. 27]: But Helen happened to be otherwise engaged for a few minutes , and Mrs. Ramshorn to be in the sick-room when the servant brought his name .
Parsing [sent. 4499 len. 53]: With her jealousy of Wingfold 's teaching , she would not have admitted him , but Lingard made such loud protest when he heard her say `` Not at home , '' insisting on seeing him , that she had to give way , and tell the maid to show him up .
Parsing [sent. 4500 len. 34]: She HAD NO NOTION however of leaving him alone in the room with the invalid : who could tell what absurd and extravagant ideas he might not put into the boy 's head !
Parsing [sent. 4501 len. 18]: He might make him turn monk , or Socinian , or latter-day-saint , for what she knew !
Parsing [sent. 4502 len. 35]: So she sat , blocking up the sole small window in the youth 's dark dwelling that looked eastward , and damming back the tide of the dawn from his diseased and tormented soul .
Parsing [sent. 4503 len. 6]: Little conversation was therefore possible .
Parsing [sent. 4504 len. 40]: Still the face of his new friend was a comfort to Leopold , and ere he left him they had managed to fix an hour for next day , when they would not be thus foiled of their talk .
Parsing [sent. 4505 len. 12]: That same afternoon , Wingfold took the draper to see Polwarth .
Parsing [sent. 4506 len. 34]: Rachel was lying on the sofa in the parlour -- a poor little heap , looking more like a grave disturbed by efforts at a resurrection , than a form informed with humanity .
Parsing [sent. 4507 len. 17]: But she was cheerful and cordial , receiving Mr. Drew and accepted his sympathy most kindly .
Parsing [sent. 4508 len. 23]: `` We 'll see what God will do for me , '' she said in answer to a word from the curate .
Parsing [sent. 4509 len. 31]: Her whole bearing , now as always , was that of one who perfectly trusted a supreme spirit under whose influences lay even the rugged material of her deformed dwelling .
Parsing [sent. 4510 len. 31]: Polwarth allowed Wingfold to help him in getting tea , and the conversation , as will be the case where all are in earnest , quickly found the right channel .
Parsing [sent. 4511 len. 12]: It is not often in real life that such conversations occur .
Parsing [sent. 4512 len. 32]: Generally , in any talk worth calling conversation , every man has some point to maintain , and his object is to justify his own thesis and disprove his neighbour 's .
Parsing [sent. 4513 len. 45]: I will allow that he may primarily have adopted his thesis because of some sign of truth in it , but his mode of supporting it is generally such as to block up every cranny in his soul at which more truth might enter .
Parsing [sent. 4514 len. 50]: In the present case , unusual as it is for so many as three truth-loving men to come thus together on the face of this planet , here were three simply set on uttering truth they had seen , and gaining sight of truth as yet veiled from them .
Parsing [sent. 4515 len. 23]: I shall attempt only a general impression of the result of their evening 's intercourse , partly recording the utterances of Polwarth .
Parsing [sent. 4516 len. 43]: `` I have been trying hard to follow you , Mr. Polwarth , '' said the draper , after his host had for a while had the talk to himself , `` but I can not get a hold of your remarks .
Parsing [sent. 4517 len. 22]: One moment I think I have got the end of the clew , and the next find myself all abroad again .
Parsing [sent. 4518 len. 32]: Would you tell me what you mean by divine service , for I think you must use the phrase in some different sense from what I have been accustomed to ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4519 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 4520 len. 42]: I ought to remember , '' said Polwarth , `` that what has grown familiar to my mind from much solitary thinking , may not at once show itself to another , when presented in the forms of a foreign individuality .
Parsing [sent. 4521 len. 29]: I ought to have premised that , when I use the phrase , DIVINE SERVICE , I mean nothing whatever belonging to the church , or its observances .
Parsing [sent. 4522 len. 22]: I mean by it what it ought to mean -- the serving of God -- the doing of something for God .
Parsing [sent. 4523 len. 57]: Shall I make of the church in my foolish imaginations a temple of idolatrous worship by supposing that it is for the sake of supplying some need that God has , or of gratifying some taste in him , that I there listen to his word , say prayers to him , and sing his praises ?
Parsing [sent. 4524 len. 15]: Shall I be such a dull mule in the presence of the living Truth ?
Parsing [sent. 4525 len. 62]: Or , to use a homely simile , shall I be as the good boy of the nursery rhyme , who , seated in his corner of selfish complacency , regards the eating of his pie as a virtuous action , enjoys the contemplation of it , and thinks what a pleasant object he thus makes of himself to his parents ?
Parsing [sent. 4526 len. 45]: Shall I , to take a step farther , degrade the sanctity of the closet , hallowed in the words of Jesus , by shutting its door in the vain fancy of there doing something that God requires of me as a sacred OBSERVANCE ?
Parsing [sent. 4527 len. 63]: Shall I foolishly imagine that to put in exercise the highest and loveliest , the most entrancing privilege of existence , that of pouring forth my whole heart into the heart of him who is ACCOUNTABLE FOR me , who hath glorified me with his own image -- in my soul , gentlemen , sadly disfigured as it is in my body !
Parsing [sent. 4528 len. 13]: -- shall I say that THAT is to do anything for God ?
Parsing [sent. 4529 len. 15]: Was I serving my father when I ate the dinner he provided for me ?
Parsing [sent. 4530 len. 16]: Am I serving my God when I eat his bread and drink his wine ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4531 len. 24]: `` But , '' said Drew , `` is not God pleased that a man should pour out his soul to him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4532 len. 52]: `` Yes , doubtless ; but what would you think of a child who said , ' I am very useful to my father , for when I ask him for anything , or tell him I love him , it gives him -- oh , such pleasure ! ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4533 len. 10]: `` I should say he was an unendurable prig .
Parsing [sent. 4534 len. 10]: Better he had to be whipped for stealing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4535 len. 4]: said the curate .
Parsing [sent. 4536 len. 15]: `` There would be more hope of his future , '' returned Polwarth . ''
Parsing [sent. 4537 len. 44]: -- Is the child , '' he continued , `` who sits by his father 's knee and looks up into his father 's face , SERVING that father , because the heart of the father delights to look down upon his child ?
Parsing [sent. 4538 len. 33]: And shall the moment of my deepest repose and bliss , the moment when I serve myself with the very life of the universe , be called a serving of my God ?
Parsing [sent. 4539 len. 21]: It is communion with God ; he holds it with me , else never could I hold it with him .
Parsing [sent. 4540 len. 25]: I am as the foam-froth upon his infinite ocean , but of the water of the ocean is the bubble on its waves . ''
Parsing [sent. 4541 len. 30]: Not the eyes only , but the whole face of the man , which had grown of a pure , semi-transparent whiteness , appeared to Wingfold to emit light .
Parsing [sent. 4542 len. 62]: `` When my child would serve me , '' he went on , '' he spies out some need I have , springs from his seat at my knee , finds that which will meet my necessity , and is my eager , happy servant , of consequence in his own eyes inasmuch as he has done something for his father .
Parsing [sent. 4543 len. 23]: His seat by my knee is love , delight , well-being , peace -- not service , however pleasing in my eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4544 len. 15]: -- ` Why do you seat yourself at my knee , my son ? '
Parsing [sent. 4545 len. 8]: ` To please you , father . '
Parsing [sent. 4546 len. 7]: ` Nay then , my son !
Parsing [sent. 4547 len. 16]: go from me , and come again when it shall be to please thyself . '
Parsing [sent. 4548 len. 13]: -- ` Why do you cling to my chair , my daughter ?
Parsing [sent. 4549 len. 11]: ` Because I want to be near you , father .
Parsing [sent. 4550 len. 7]: It makes me so happy ! '
Parsing [sent. 4551 len. 19]: ` Come nearer still -- come to my bosom , my child , and be yet happier . '
Parsing [sent. 4552 len. 15]: -- Talk not of public worship as divine service ; it is a mockery .
Parsing [sent. 4553 len. 41]: Search the prophets and you will find the observances , fasts and sacrifices and solemn feasts , of the temple by them regarded with loathing and scorn , just because by the people they were regarded as DIVINE SERVICE . ''
Parsing [sent. 4554 len. 37]: `` But , '' said Mr. Drew , while Wingfold turned towards him with some anxiety lest he should break the mood of the little prophet , `` I ca n't help thinking I have you !
Parsing [sent. 4555 len. 57]: for how are poor creatures like us -- weak , blundering creatures , sometimes most awkward when best-intentioned -- how are we to minister to a perfect God -- perfect in wisdom , strength , and everything -- of whom Paul says that he is not worshipped with men 's hands as though he needed anything ?
Parsing [sent. 4556 len. 14]: I can not help thinking that you are fighting merely with a word .
Parsing [sent. 4557 len. 35]: Certainly , if the phrase ever was used in that sense , there is no meaning of the kind attached to it now : it stands merely for the forms of public worship . ''
Parsing [sent. 4558 len. 32]: `` Were there no such thing as Divine Service in the true sense of the word , then , indeed it would scarcely be worth while to quarrel with its misapplication .
Parsing [sent. 4559 len. 39]: But I assert that true and genuine service may be rendered to the living God ; and , for the development of the divine nature in man , it is necessary that he should do something for God .
Parsing [sent. 4560 len. 36]: Nor is it hard to discover how ; for God is in every creature that he has made , and in their needs he is needy , and in all their afflictions he is afflicted .
Parsing [sent. 4561 len. 18]: Therefore Jesus says that whatever is done to one of his little ones is done to him .
Parsing [sent. 4562 len. 50]: And if the soul of a man be the temple of the Spirit , then is the place of that man 's labour , his shop , his counting-house , his laboratory , the temple of Jesus Christ , where the spirit of the man is incarnate in work .
Parsing [sent. 4563 len. 5]: -- Mr. Drew ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4564 len. 28]: -- Here the gate-keeper stood up , and held out both his hands , palms upward , towards the draper on the other side of the table .
Parsing [sent. 4565 len. 5]: -- `` Mr. Drew !
Parsing [sent. 4566 len. 86]: your shop is the temple of your service where the Lord Christ , the only image of the Father is , or ought to be throned ; your counter is , or ought to be his altar ; and everything thereon laid , with intent of doing as well as you can for your neighbour , in the name of THE man Christ Jesus , is a true sacrifice offered to Him , a service done to the eternal creating Love of the universe . ''
Parsing [sent. 4567 len. 50]: The little prophet 's head as he stood , did not reach the level of the draper 's as he sat , but at this Drew dropped his head on his hands upon the table , as if bowed down by a weight of thought and feeling and worship .
Parsing [sent. 4568 len. 53]: `` I say not , '' Polwarth went on , `` that so doing you will grow a rich man , but I say that so doing you will be saved from growing too rich , and that you will be a fellow-worker with God for the salvation of his world . ''
Parsing [sent. 4569 len. 14]: `` I must live ; I can not give my goods away ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4570 len. 12]: murmured Mr. Drew , thinkingly , as one that sought enlightenment .
Parsing [sent. 4571 len. 19]: `` That would be to go direct against the order of his world , `` said Polwarth . ''
Parsing [sent. 4572 len. 64]: No ; a harder task is yours , Mr. Drew -- to make your business a gain to you , and at the same time to be not only what is commonly counted just , but interested in , and careful of , and caring for your neighbour , as a servant of the God of bounty who giveth to all men liberally .
Parsing [sent. 4573 len. 16]: Your calling is to do the best for your neighbour that you reasonably can . ''
Parsing [sent. 4574 len. 11]: `` But who is to fix what is reasonable ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4575 len. 3]: asked Drew .
Parsing [sent. 4576 len. 13]: `` The man himself , thinking in the presence of Jesus Christ .
Parsing [sent. 4577 len. 11]: There is a holy moderation which is of God . ''
Parsing [sent. 4578 len. 20]: `` There wo n't be many fortunes -- great fortunes -- made after that rule , Mr. Polwarth . ''
Parsing [sent. 4579 len. 5]: `` Very few . ''
Parsing [sent. 4580 len. 15]: `` Then do you say that no great fortunes have been righteously made ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4581 len. 11]: `` If RIGHTEOUSLY means AFTER THE FASHION OF JESUS CHRIST .
Parsing [sent. 4582 len. 26]: -- But I will not judge : that is for the God-enlightened conscience of the man himself to do -- not for his neighbour 's .
Parsing [sent. 4583 len. 11]: Why should I be judged by another man 's conscience ?
Parsing [sent. 4584 len. 58]: -- But you see , Mr. Drew , -- and this is what I was driving at -- that you have it in your power to SERVE God , through the needs of his children , all the working day , from morning to night , so long as there is a customer in your shop . ''
Parsing [sent. 4585 len. 15]: `` I do think you are right , sir , '' said the linen-draper .
Parsing [sent. 4586 len. 14]: `` I had a glimpse of the same thing the other night myself .
Parsing [sent. 4587 len. 25]: And yet it seems as if you spoke of a purely ideal state -- one that could not be realised in this world . ''
Parsing [sent. 4588 len. 30]: `` Purely ideal or not , one thing is certain : it will never be reached by one who is so indifferent to it as to believe it impossible .
Parsing [sent. 4589 len. 37]: Whether it may be reached in this world or not , that is a question of NO consequence ; whether a man has begun to REACH AFTER it , is of the utmost awfulness of import .
Parsing [sent. 4590 len. 27]: And should it be ideal , which I doubt , what else than the ideal have the followers of the ideal man to do with ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4591 len. 23]: `` Can a man reach anything ideal before he has God dwelling in him -- filling every cranny of his soul ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4592 len. 7]: asked the curate with shining eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4593 len. 13]: `` Nothing , I do most solemnly believe , '' answered Polwarth .
Parsing [sent. 4594 len. 47]: `` It weighs on me heavily sometimes , '' he resumed , after a pause , `` to think how far all but a few are from being able even to entertain the idea of the indwelling in them of the original power of their life .
Parsing [sent. 4595 len. 19]: True , God is in every man , else how could he live the life he does live ?
Parsing [sent. 4596 len. 25]: but that life God keeps alive for the hour when he shall inform the will , the aspiration , the imagination of the man .
Parsing [sent. 4597 len. 48]: When the man throws wide his door to the Father of his spirit , when his individual being is thus supplemented -- to use a poor miserable word -- with the individuality that originated it , then is the man a whole , healthy , complete existence .
Parsing [sent. 4598 len. 25]: Then indeed , and then only , will he do no wrong , think no wrong , love perfectly , and be right merry .
Parsing [sent. 4599 len. 21]: Then will he scarce think of praying , because God is in every thought and enters anew with every sensation .
Parsing [sent. 4600 len. 26]: Then will he forgive , and endure , and pour out his soul for the beloved who yet grope their way in doubt and passion .
Parsing [sent. 4601 len. 34]: Then every man will be dear and precious to him , even the worst , for in him also lies an unknown yearning after the same peace wherein he rests and loves . ''
Parsing [sent. 4602 len. 13]: He sat down suddenly , and a deep silence filled the room .
Parsing [sent. 4603 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXVIII .
Parsing [sent. 4604 len. 5]: A SHOP IN HEAVEN .
Parsing [sent. 4605 len. 20]: `` Uncle , '' said Rachel , `` may I read your visions of the shops in heaven ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4606 len. 6]: `` Oh no , Rachel .
Parsing [sent. 4607 len. 14]: You are not able to read to-night , '' said her uncle deprecatingly .
Parsing [sent. 4608 len. 8]: `` I think I am , uncle .
Parsing [sent. 4609 len. 6]: I should like to try .
Parsing [sent. 4610 len. 16]: It will let the gentlemen see what you WOULD think an ideal state of things .
Parsing [sent. 4611 len. 25]: -- It is something , Mr. Wingfold , my uncle once dictated to me , and I wrote down just as he said it .
Parsing [sent. 4612 len. 54]: He can always do better dictating than writing , but this time he was so ill with asthma that he could not talk much faster than I could write ; and yet to be so ill I never saw him show so little suffering ; his thinking seemed to make him forget it .
Parsing [sent. 4613 len. 9]: -- May n't I read it , uncle ?
Parsing [sent. 4614 len. 11]: I know the gentlemen would like to hear it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4615 len. 12]: `` That we should , '' said both men at once .
Parsing [sent. 4616 len. 24]: `` I will fetch it you then , '' said Polwarth , `` if you will tell me where to find it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4617 len. 23]: Rachel gave him the needful directions , and presently he brought a few sheets of paper , and handed them to her .
Parsing [sent. 4618 len. 13]: `` This is no dream , Mr. Wingfold , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4619 len. 15]: `` It is something I thought fairly out before I began to dictate it .
Parsing [sent. 4620 len. 25]: But the only fit form I could find for it was that of a vision -- like the Vision of Mirza , you know .
Parsing [sent. 4621 len. 14]: -- Now read , Rachel , and I will hold my tongue . ''
Parsing [sent. 4622 len. 11]: After a little arranging of the sheets , Rachel began .
Parsing [sent. 4623 len. 18]: She read not without difficulty , but her pleasure in what she read helped her through . ''
Parsing [sent. 4624 len. 36]: ` And now , said my guide to me , I will bring thee to a city of the righteous , and show thee how they buy and sell in this the kingdom of heaven .
Parsing [sent. 4625 len. 22]: So we journeyed a day and another day and half a day , and I was weary ere we arrived thither .
Parsing [sent. 4626 len. 36]: But when I saw the loveliness of the place , and drew in the healing air thereof , my weariness vanished as a dream of the night , and I said , IT IS WELL .
Parsing [sent. 4627 len. 35]: -- I may not now speak of the houses and the dress and the customs of the dwellers therein , save what may belong to the buying and selling of which I have spoken .
Parsing [sent. 4628 len. 78]: Gladly would I tell of the streams that went , some noiselessly gliding , others gurgling , some sweeping , some rushing and roaring , through every street , all issuing from one right plenteous fountain in the middle of the city , so that the ear was for ever filled with the sound of many waters all the day , ceasing when the night came , that silence might have its perfect work upon the soul .
Parsing [sent. 4629 len. 24]: Gladly too would I tell of the trees and flowers and grass that grew in every street along the banks of the rivers .
Parsing [sent. 4630 len. 6]: But I must withhold . ''
Parsing [sent. 4631 len. 104]: ` After I had , I know not for how long , refreshed my soul with what it was thus given , me to enjoy , -- for in all that country there is no such thing as haste , no darting from one thing to another , but a calm eternal progress in which unto the day the good thereof is sufficient -- one great noon-day , my conductor led me into a large place , such as we would call a shop here , although the arrangements were different , and an air of stateliness dwelt in and around the house .
Parsing [sent. 4632 len. 42]: It was filled with the loveliest silken and woollen stuffs , of all kinds and colours , a thousand delights to the eye -- and to the thought also , for here was endless harmony , and no discord . '' '
Parsing [sent. 4633 len. 60]: I stood in the midst , and my guide stood by me in silence ; for all the time I was in the country , he seldom spoke to me save when first I asked of him , and yet he never showed any weariness , and often a half-smile would dwell for a moment upon his countenance . ''
Parsing [sent. 4634 len. 76]: ` And first I watched the faces of them that sold ; and I could read therein -- for be it understood that , according to the degree of his own capacity , a man there could perfectly read the countenance of every neighbour , that is , unless it expressed something that was not in himself -- and I could read in them nothing of eagerness , only the calm of a concentrated ministration .
Parsing [sent. 4635 len. 44]: There was no seeking there , but a strength of giving , a business-like earnestness to supply lack , enlivened by no haste , and dulled by no weariness , brightened ever by the reflected content of those who found their wants supplied .
Parsing [sent. 4636 len. 31]: As soon as one buyer was contented they turned graciously to another , and gave ear until they perfectly understood with what object he had come to seek their aid .
Parsing [sent. 4637 len. 36]: Nor did their countenances change utterly as they turned away , for upon them lingered the satisfaction as of one who hath had a success , and by degrees melted into the supervening content . ''
Parsing [sent. 4638 len. 13]: ` Then I turned to watch the countenances of them that bought .
Parsing [sent. 4639 len. 14]: -- And there in like manner I saw no cupidity and no meanness .
Parsing [sent. 4640 len. 32]: They spake humbly , yet not because they sought a favour , but because they were humble , for with their humility was mingled the confidence of receiving that they sought .
Parsing [sent. 4641 len. 24]: And truly it was a pleasure to see how everyone knew what his desire was , making his choice readily and with decision .
Parsing [sent. 4642 len. 19]: I perceived also that everyone spoke not merely respectfully , but gratefully , to him who served him .
Parsing [sent. 4643 len. 31]: And at meeting and parting such kindly though brief greetings passed as made me wonder whether every inhabitant of such a mighty city could know every other that dwelt therein .
Parsing [sent. 4644 len. 21]: But I soon saw that it came not of individual knowledge , but of universal faith and all-embracing love . ''
Parsing [sent. 4645 len. 53]: ` And as I stood and watched , suddenly it came into my mind that I had never yet seen the coin of the country , and thereupon I kept my eyes upon a certain woman who bought silk , that when she paid for the same I might see the money .
Parsing [sent. 4646 len. 20]: But that which she had largely bought she took in her arms and carried away , and paid not .
Parsing [sent. 4647 len. 30]: Therefore I turned to watch another , who bought for a long journey , but when he carried away that he bought , neither did he pay any money .
Parsing [sent. 4648 len. 37]: And I said to myself , These are well-known persons , to whom it is more convenient to pay all at a certain season ; and I turned to a third who bought much fine linen .
Parsing [sent. 4649 len. 3]: But behold !
Parsing [sent. 4650 len. 4]: he paid not .
Parsing [sent. 4651 len. 31]: Then I began to observe again those that sold ; whereupon I thought with myself , How good must be the air of this land for the remembrance of things !
Parsing [sent. 4652 len. 19]: for these men write down nothing to keep on record the moneys men owe them on all sides .
Parsing [sent. 4653 len. 56]: And I looked and looked again and yet again , and stood long watching -- but so it was throughout the whole place , which thronged and buzzed and swarmed like the busiest of bee-hives -- no man paid , and no man had a book wherein to write that which the other owed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4654 len. 15]: ` Then I turned to my guide and said : How lovely is honesty !
Parsing [sent. 4655 len. 10]: and truly from what a labour it absolveth men !
Parsing [sent. 4656 len. 78]: for here I see every man keepeth in his mind his own debts , and not the debts of others , so that time is not spent in paying of small sums , neither in the keeping of account of such ; but he that buyeth counteth up , and doubtless when the day of reckoning arrives , each cometh and casteth the money he oweth into the merchant 's coffer , and both are satisfied . ''
Parsing [sent. 4657 len. 15]: ` Then my conductor smiled , and said , Watch yet a while . ''
Parsing [sent. 4658 len. 15]: ` And I did as he said unto me , and stood and watched .
Parsing [sent. 4659 len. 21]: But the same thing went on everywhere ; and I said to myself , Lo , I see nothing new !
Parsing [sent. 4660 len. 22]: -- Suddenly , at my side , a man dropped upon his knees , and bowed his head to the ground .
Parsing [sent. 4661 len. 25]: And those that stood nigh him dropped also upon their knees , and there arose a sound as of soft thunder ; and lo !
Parsing [sent. 4662 len. 18]: everyone in the place had dropped upon his knees , and spread his hands out before him .
Parsing [sent. 4663 len. 24]: Every voice and every noise was hushed , every movement had ceased , and I and my guide alone were left standing . ''
Parsing [sent. 4664 len. 21]: ` Then I whispered in his ear , It is the hour of prayer : shall we not kneel also ?
Parsing [sent. 4665 len. 25]: And my guide answered , No man in this city kneeleth because others do , and no man is judged if he kneeleth not .
Parsing [sent. 4666 len. 35]: If thou hast any grief or pain upon thee , then kneel ; if not , then love God in thy heart and be thankful , and kneel when thou goest into thy chamber .
Parsing [sent. 4667 len. 15]: Then said I , I will not kneel , but will watch and see .
Parsing [sent. 4668 len. 14]: -- It is well , said my guide ; and I stood . ''
Parsing [sent. 4669 len. 43]: ` For certain moments all was utter stillness -- every man and woman kneeling , with hands outstretched , save him who had first kneeled , and his hands hung by his sides and his head was still bowed to the earth .
Parsing [sent. 4670 len. 9]: At length he rose up , and lo !
Parsing [sent. 4671 len. 56]: his face was wet with tears ; and all the people rose also , and with a noise throughout the place ; and the man made a low obeisance to them that were nigh him , the which they returned with equal reverence , and then with downcast eyes he walked slowly from the shop .
Parsing [sent. 4672 len. 33]: The moment he was gone , the business of the place , without a word of remark on any side concerning what had passed , began again and went on as before .
Parsing [sent. 4673 len. 23]: People came and went , some more eager and outward , some more staid and inward , but all contented and cheerful .
Parsing [sent. 4674 len. 33]: At length a bell somewhere rang sweet and shrill , and after that no one entered the place , and what was in progress began to be led to a decorous conclusion .
Parsing [sent. 4675 len. 34]: In three or four minutes the floor was empty , and the people also of the shop had gone , each about his own affairs , without shutting door or window . '' '
Parsing [sent. 4676 len. 36]: I went out last with my guide , and we seated ourselves under a tree of the willow-kind on the bank of one of the quieter streams , and straightway I began to question him .
Parsing [sent. 4677 len. 70]: Tell me , sir , I said , the purport of what I have seen , for not yet have I understood how these happy people do their business and pass from hand to hand not a single coin I And he answered , Where greed and ambition and self-love rule , money must be : where there is neither greed nor ambition nor self-love , money is needless .
Parsing [sent. 4678 len. 21]: And I asked , Is it then by the same ancient mode of barter that they go about their affairs ?
Parsing [sent. 4679 len. 9]: Truly I saw no exchange of any sort .
Parsing [sent. 4680 len. 29]: -- Bethink thee , said my guide , if thou hadst gone into any other shop throughout the whole city , thou wouldst have seen the same thing .
Parsing [sent. 4681 len. 16]: I see not how that should make the matter plainer to me , I answered .
Parsing [sent. 4682 len. 28]: -- Where neither greed nor ambition nor selfishness reigneth , said my guide , there need and desire have free scope , for they work no evil .
Parsing [sent. 4683 len. 14]: -- But even now I understand you not , sir , I said .
Parsing [sent. 4684 len. 18]: -- Hear me then , answered my guide , for I will speak to thee more plainly .
Parsing [sent. 4685 len. 15]: Wherefore do men take money in their hands when they go where things are ?
Parsing [sent. 4686 len. 13]: -- Because they may not have the things without giving the money .
Parsing [sent. 4687 len. 20]: -- And where they may have things without giving money , there they take no money in their hands ?
Parsing [sent. 4688 len. 13]: -- Truly no , sir , if there be such a place .
Parsing [sent. 4689 len. 14]: -- Then such a place is this , and so is it here .
Parsing [sent. 4690 len. 15]: -- But how can men give of their goods and receive nought in return ?
Parsing [sent. 4691 len. 7]: -- By receiving everything in return .
Parsing [sent. 4692 len. 16]: Tell me , said my guide , why do men take money for their goods ?
Parsing [sent. 4693 len. 18]: -- That they may have wherewithal to go and buy other things which they need for themselves .
Parsing [sent. 4694 len. 47]: -- But if they also may go to this place or that place where the things are the which they need , and receive of those things without money and without price , is there then good cause why they should take money in their hands ?
Parsing [sent. 4695 len. 20]: -- Truly no , I answered ; and I begin , methinks , to see how the affair goeth .
Parsing [sent. 4696 len. 13]: Yet are there some things still whereupon I would gladly be resolved .
Parsing [sent. 4697 len. 45]: And first of all , how cometh it that men are moved to provide these and those goods for the supply of the wants of their neighbours , when they are drawn thereto by no want in themselves , and no advantage to themselves ?
Parsing [sent. 4698 len. 49]: -- Thou reasonest , said my guide , as one of thine own degree , who to the eyes of the full-born ever look like chrysalids , closed round in a web of their own weaving ; and who shall blame thee until thou thyself shinest within thyself ?
Parsing [sent. 4699 len. 21]: Understand that it is never advantage to himself that moveth a man in this kingdom to undertake this or that .
Parsing [sent. 4700 len. 20]: The thing that alone advantageth a man here is the thing which he doth without thought unto that advantage .
Parsing [sent. 4701 len. 10]: To your world , this world goeth by contraries .
Parsing [sent. 4702 len. 58]: The man here that doeth most service , that aideth others the most to the obtaining of their honest desires , is the man who standeth highest with the Lord of the place , and his reward and honour is , to be enabled to the spending of himself yet more for the good of his fellows .
Parsing [sent. 4703 len. 32]: There goeth a rumour amongst us even now that one shall ere long be ripe for the carrying of a message from the King to the spirits that are in prison .
Parsing [sent. 4704 len. 101]: Thinkest thou it is a less potent stirring up of thought and energy to desire and seek and find the things that will please the eye , and cheer the brain , and gladden the heart of the people of this great city , so that when one prayeth , ` Give me , friend , of thy loaves , ' a man may answer , ` Take of them , friend , as many as thou needest ' -- is that , I say , an incentive to diligence less potent than the desire to hoard or to excel ?
Parsing [sent. 4705 len. 18]: Is it not to share the bliss of God who hoardeth nothing , but ever giveth liberally ?
Parsing [sent. 4706 len. 45]: The joy of a man here is to enable another to lay hold upon that which is of his own kind and be glad and grow thereby -- doctrine strange and unbelievable to the man in whom the well of life is yet sealed .
Parsing [sent. 4707 len. 23]: Never have they been many at a time in the old world who could thus enter into the joy of their Lord .
Parsing [sent. 4708 len. 21]: And yet , if thou bethink thee , thou wilt perceive that such bliss is not unknown amongst thy fellows .
Parsing [sent. 4709 len. 36]: Knowest thou no musician who would find it joy enough for a night , to scale the tower of a hundred bells , and send the great meteors of music-light flying over the care-tortured city ?
Parsing [sent. 4710 len. 55]: Would everyone even of thy half-created race reason with himself and say : Truly it is in the night , and no one can see who it is that ministereth ; the sounds alone will go forth nor bear my image ; I shall reap no honour ; I will not rise and go ?
Parsing [sent. 4711 len. 36]: Thou knowest , I say , some in thy world who would not speak thus in their hearts , but would willingly consent to be as nothing , so to give life to their fellows .
Parsing [sent. 4712 len. 31]: In this city so is it with all -- in shop or workshop , in study or theatre , all seek to spend and be spent for the lovely all .
Parsing [sent. 4713 len. 22]: -- And I said , One thing tell me , sir -- how much a man may have for the asking .
Parsing [sent. 4714 len. 14]: -- What he will -- that is , what he can well use .
Parsing [sent. 4715 len. 9]: -- Who then shall be the judge thereof ?
Parsing [sent. 4716 len. 7]: -- Who but the man himself ?
Parsing [sent. 4717 len. 16]: -- What if he should turn to greed , and begin to hoard and spare ?
Parsing [sent. 4718 len. 18]: -- Sawest thou not the man this day because of whom all business ceased for a time ?
Parsing [sent. 4719 len. 25]: -- to that man had come a thought of accumulation instead of growth , and he dropped upon his knees in shame and terror .
Parsing [sent. 4720 len. 76]: And thou sawest how all business ceased , and straightway that of the shop was made what below they call a church ; for everyone hastened to the poor man 's help , the air was filled with praying breath , and the atmosphere of God-loving souls was around him ; the foul thought fled , and the man went forth glad and humble , and to-morrow he will return for that which he needeth .
Parsing [sent. 4721 len. 20]: If thou shouldst be present then , thou wilt see him more tenderly ministered unto than all the rest .
Parsing [sent. 4722 len. 9]: -- And if such a man prayed not ?
Parsing [sent. 4723 len. 33]: -- If such a man slept ere he repented , he would wake with hatred in his heart towards the city and everyone therein , and would straightway flee into the wilderness .
Parsing [sent. 4724 len. 103]: And the angel of the Lord would go out after him , and smite him with a word , and he would vanish from amongst us , and his life would be the life of one of those least of living things that are in your world born of the water ; and there must he grow up again , crawling through the channels of thousand-folded difference , from animal to animal , until at length a human brain be given him , and after generations he become once again capable of being born of the spirit into the kingdom of liberty .
Parsing [sent. 4725 len. 27]: Then shall all his past life open upon him , and in shame and dismay will he repent a thousand-fold , and will sin no more .
Parsing [sent. 4726 len. 21]: Such , at least , are thoughts of our wise men upon the matter ; but truly we know not .
Parsing [sent. 4727 len. 8]: -- It is good , I said .
Parsing [sent. 4728 len. 18]: But how are men guided as to what lies to them to provide for the general good ?
Parsing [sent. 4729 len. 22]: -- Every man doeth what thing he can , and the more his labour is desired , the more he rejoices .
Parsing [sent. 4730 len. 16]: -- If a man should desire that he could no where find in the city ?
Parsing [sent. 4731 len. 25]: -- Then would he straightway do his endeavour to provide that thing for all in the city who might after him desire the same .
Parsing [sent. 4732 len. 14]: -- Now , sir , methinks I know and understand , I answered .
Parsing [sent. 4733 len. 9]: And we rose and went farther . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 4734 len. 8]: `` I think that COULD be ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4735 len. 13]: said the curate , breaking the silence that followed when Rachel ceased .
Parsing [sent. 4736 len. 11]: `` Not in this world , '' said the draper .
Parsing [sent. 4737 len. 32]: `` To doubt that it COULD be , '' said the gatekeeper , `` would be to doubt whether the kingdom of heaven is a chimera or a divine idea . ''
Parsing [sent. 4738 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXIX .
Parsing [sent. 4739 len. 4]: POLWARTH AND LINGARD .
Parsing [sent. 4740 len. 39]: The morning after Wingfold 's second visit , Lingard , much to his sister 's surprise , partly to her pleasure , and somewhat to her consternation , asked for his clothes : he wanted to get up .
Parsing [sent. 4741 len. 46]: So little energy had he hitherto shown , so weak was he , and so frequent had been the symptoms of returning fever , that the doctor had not yet thought of advising more than an hour 's sitting while his bed was made comfortable .
Parsing [sent. 4742 len. 23]: And Helen had felt that she had him , if not safe , yet safer in bed than he could be elsewhere .
Parsing [sent. 4743 len. 13]: His wish to rise was a sign that he was getting better .
Parsing [sent. 4744 len. 20]: But could she wish him to get better , seeing every hour threatened to be an hour of torture ?
Parsing [sent. 4745 len. 29]: On the other hand , she could not but hope that , for the last day or so , his mind had been a little more at ease .
Parsing [sent. 4746 len. 24]: Assuredly the light in his eye was less troubled : perhaps he saw prospect of such mental quiet as might render life endurable .
Parsing [sent. 4747 len. 22]: He declined assistance , and Helen , having got him everything he required , left the room to wait within hearing .
Parsing [sent. 4748 len. 24]: It took him a long time to dress , but he had resolved to do it himself , and at length called Helen .
Parsing [sent. 4749 len. 14]: She found he looked worse in his clothes -- fearfully worn and white !
Parsing [sent. 4750 len. 14]: Ah , what a sad ghost he was of his former sunny self !
Parsing [sent. 4751 len. 51]: Helen turned her eyes from him , that he might not see how changed she thought him , and there were the trees in the garden and the meadows and the park beyond , bathing in the strength of the sun , betwixt the blue sky and the green earth !
Parsing [sent. 4752 len. 9]: `` What a hideous world it is ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4753 len. 5]: she said to herself .
Parsing [sent. 4754 len. 30]: She was not yet persuaded , like her cousin , that it was the best possible world -- only that , unfortunately , not much was possible in worlds .
Parsing [sent. 4755 len. 13]: `` Will you get me something , Helen , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4756 len. 19]: `` Mr. Wingfold will be here , and I want to be able to talk to him . ''
Parsing [sent. 4757 len. 23]: It was the first time he had asked for food , though he had seldom refused to take what she brought him .
Parsing [sent. 4758 len. 26]: She made him lie on the couch , and gave orders that , if Mr. Wingfold called , he should be shown up at once .
Parsing [sent. 4759 len. 14]: Leopold 's face brightened ; he actually looked pleased when his soup came .
Parsing [sent. 4760 len. 12]: When Wingfold was announced , he grew for a moment radiant .
Parsing [sent. 4761 len. 20]: Helen received the curate respectfully , but not very cordially : SHE could not make Leopold 's face shine !
Parsing [sent. 4762 len. 11]: `` Would your brother like to see Mr. Polwarth ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4763 len. 6]: asked the curate rather abruptly .
Parsing [sent. 4764 len. 12]: `` I will see anyone you would like me to see .
Parsing [sent. 4765 len. 18]: Mr. Wingfold , '' answered Liugard for himself , with a decision that clearly indicated returning strength .
Parsing [sent. 4766 len. 38]: `` But , Leopold , you know it is hardly to be desired , '' suggested Helen , `` that more persons -- '' `` I do n't know that , '' interrupted Leopold with strange expression .
Parsing [sent. 4767 len. 30]: `` Perhaps I had better tell you , Miss Lingard , '' said the curate , `` that it was Mr. Polwarth who found the thing I gave you .
Parsing [sent. 4768 len. 46]: After your visit , he could not fail to put things together , and had he been a common man , I should have judged it prudent to tell him for the sake of secrecy what I have told him for the sake of counsel .
Parsing [sent. 4769 len. 27]: I repeat in your brother 's hearing what I have said to you , that he is the wisest and best man I have ever known .
Parsing [sent. 4770 len. 14]: -- I left him in the meadow at the foot of the garden .
Parsing [sent. 4771 len. 15]: He is suffering to-day , and I wanted to save him the longer walk .
Parsing [sent. 4772 len. 15]: If you will allow me , I will go and bring him in . ''
Parsing [sent. 4773 len. 7]: `` Do , '' said Leopold .
Parsing [sent. 4774 len. 5]: `` Think , Helen !
Parsing [sent. 4775 len. 14]: -- If he is the wisest and best man Mr. Wingfold ever knew !
Parsing [sent. 4776 len. 9]: Tell him where to find the key . ''
Parsing [sent. 4777 len. 17]: `` I will go myself , '' she said -- with a yielding to the inevitable .
Parsing [sent. 4778 len. 20]: When she opened the door , there was the little man seated a few yards off on the grass .
Parsing [sent. 4779 len. 20]: He had plucked a cowslip and was looking into it so intently that he neither heard nor saw her .
Parsing [sent. 4780 len. 5]: `` Mr. Polwarth ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4781 len. 3]: said Helen .
Parsing [sent. 4782 len. 44]: He lifted his eyes , rose , and taking off his hat , said with a smile , `` I was looking in the cowslip for the spots which the fairy , in the Midsummer Night 's Dream , calls ` rubies . '
Parsing [sent. 4783 len. 10]: -- How is your brother , Miss Lingard ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4784 len. 23]: Helen answered with cold politeness , and led the way up the garden with considerably more stateliness of demeanour than was necessary .
Parsing [sent. 4785 len. 24]: When he followed her into the room , `` This is Mr. Polwarth , Leopold , '' said the curate , rising respectfully .
Parsing [sent. 4786 len. 27]: `` You may speak to him as freely as to me , and he is far more able to give you counsel than I am . ''
Parsing [sent. 4787 len. 13]: `` Would you mind shaking hands with me , Mr. Polwarth ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4788 len. 9]: said Leopold , holding out his shadowy hand .
Parsing [sent. 4789 len. 17]: Polwarth took it with the kindest of smiles , and held it a moment in his .
Parsing [sent. 4790 len. 13]: `` You think me an odd-looking creature -- do n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4791 len. 41]: he said ; `` but just because God made me so , I have been compelled to think about things I might otherwise have forgotten , and that is why Mr. Wingfold would have me come to see you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4792 len. 14]: The curate placed a chair for him , and the gate-keeper sat down .
Parsing [sent. 4793 len. 22]: Helen seated herself a little way off in the window , pretending , or hardly more , to hem a handkerchief .
Parsing [sent. 4794 len. 16]: Leopold 's big eyes went wandering from one to the other of the two men .
Parsing [sent. 4795 len. 9]: `` What a horrible world it is ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4796 len. 16]: was the thought that kept humming on like an evil insect in Helen 's heart .
Parsing [sent. 4797 len. 35]: `` I am sorry to see you suffer so much , '' said Leopold kindly , for he heard the laboured breath of the little man , and saw the heaving of his chest .
Parsing [sent. 4798 len. 12]: `` It does not greatly trouble me , '' returned Polwarth .
Parsing [sent. 4799 len. 28]: `` It is not my fault , you see , '' he added with a smile ; `` at least I do n't think it is . ''
Parsing [sent. 4800 len. 13]: `` You are happy to suffer without fault , '' said Leopold .
Parsing [sent. 4801 len. 18]: `` It is because it is just that my punishment seems greater than I can bear . ''
Parsing [sent. 4802 len. 11]: `` You need God 's forgiveness in your soul . ''
Parsing [sent. 4803 len. 14]: `` I do n't see how that should do anything for me . ''
Parsing [sent. 4804 len. 22]: `` I do not mean it would take away your suffering ; but it would make you able to bear it .
Parsing [sent. 4805 len. 9]: It would be fresh life in you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4806 len. 9]: `` I ca n't see why it should .
Parsing [sent. 4807 len. 10]: I ca n't feel that I have wronged God .
Parsing [sent. 4808 len. 18]: I have been trying to feel it , Mr. Wingfold , ever since you talked to me .
Parsing [sent. 4809 len. 18]: But I do n't know God , and I only feel what I have done to Emmeline .
Parsing [sent. 4810 len. 31]: If I said to God , ` Pardon me , ' and he said to me , ' I do pardon you , ' I should feel just the same .
Parsing [sent. 4811 len. 14]: What could that do to set anything right that I have set wrong ?
Parsing [sent. 4812 len. 35]: I am what I am , and what I ever shall be , and the injury which came from me , cleaves fast to her , and is my wrong wherever she is . ''
Parsing [sent. 4813 len. 8]: He hid his face in his hands .
Parsing [sent. 4814 len. 14]: `` What use CAN it be to torture the poor boy so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4815 len. 5]: said Helen to herself .
Parsing [sent. 4816 len. 6]: The two men sat silent .
Parsing [sent. 4817 len. 17]: Then Polwarth said : `` I doubt if there is any use in trying to feel .
Parsing [sent. 4818 len. 24]: And no amount of trying could enable you to imagine what God 's forgiveness is like to those that have it in them .
Parsing [sent. 4819 len. 12]: Tell me something more you do feel , Mr. Lingard . ''
Parsing [sent. 4820 len. 16]: `` I feel that I could kill myself to bring her back to life . ''
Parsing [sent. 4821 len. 18]: `` That is , you would gladly make amends for the wrong you have done her . ''
Parsing [sent. 4822 len. 15]: `` I would give my life , my soul , to do it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4823 len. 12]: `` And there is nothing you can do for it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4824 len. 5]: Helen began to tremble .
Parsing [sent. 4825 len. 10]: `` What is there that can be done ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4826 len. 3]: answered Leopold .
Parsing [sent. 4827 len. 26]: `` It does seem hard that a man should be made capable of doing things that he is not made capable of undoing again . ''
Parsing [sent. 4828 len. 8]: `` It is indeed a terrible thought !
Parsing [sent. 4829 len. 23]: And even the smallest wrong is , perhaps , too awful a thing for created being ever to set right again . ''
Parsing [sent. 4830 len. 11]: `` You mean it takes God to do that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4831 len. 5]: `` I do . ''
Parsing [sent. 4832 len. 15]: `` I do n't see how he ever could set some things right . ''
Parsing [sent. 4833 len. 38]: `` He would not be God if he could not or would not do for his creature what that creature can not do for himself , and must have done for him or lose his life . ''
Parsing [sent. 4834 len. 15]: `` Then he is n't God , for he ca n't help me . ''
Parsing [sent. 4835 len. 39]: `` Because you do n't see what can be done , you say God can do nothing -- which is as much as to say there can not be more within his scope than there is within yours !
Parsing [sent. 4836 len. 25]: One thing is clear , that , if he saw no more than what lies within your ken , he could not be God .
Parsing [sent. 4837 len. 17]: The very impossibility you see in the thing points to the region wherein God works . ''
Parsing [sent. 4838 len. 8]: `` I do n't quite understand you .
Parsing [sent. 4839 len. 6]: But it does n't matter .
Parsing [sent. 4840 len. 7]: It 's all a horrible mess .
Parsing [sent. 4841 len. 7]: I wish I was dead . ''
Parsing [sent. 4842 len. 45]: `` My dear sir , is it reasonable that because a being so capable of going wrong finds himself incapable of setting right , he should judge it useless to cry to that being who called him into being to come to his aid ?
Parsing [sent. 4843 len. 31]: -- and that in the face of the story -- if it were but an old legend , worn and disfigured -- that he took upon himself our sins ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4844 len. 5]: Leopold hung his head .
Parsing [sent. 4845 len. 38]: `` God needs no making up to him , '' the gate-keeper went on -- `` so far from it that he takes our sins on himself , that he may clear them out of the universe .
Parsing [sent. 4846 len. 26]: How could he say he took our sins upon him , if he could not make amends for them to those they had hurt ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4847 len. 4]: `` Ah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4848 len. 15]: cried Leopold , with a profound sigh , '' -- if that could be !
Parsing [sent. 4849 len. 9]: -- if he could really do that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4850 len. 11]: `` Why , of course he can do that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4851 len. 3]: said Polwarth .
Parsing [sent. 4852 len. 20]: `` What sort of watchmaker were he who could not set right the watches and clocks himself made ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4853 len. 10]: `` But the hearts of men and women ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4854 len. 10]: `` Which God does far more than make ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4855 len. 3]: interposed Polwarth .
Parsing [sent. 4856 len. 37]: `` That a being able to make another self-conscious being distinct from himself , should be able also to set right whatever that being could set wrong , seems to me to follow of simple necessity .
Parsing [sent. 4857 len. 51]: He might even , should that be fit , put the man himself in the way of making up for what he had done , or at least put it in his power to ask and receive a forgiveness that would set all right between him and the person wronged .
Parsing [sent. 4858 len. 39]: One of the painful things in the dogma of the endless loss of the wicked is that it leaves no room for the righteous to make up to them for the wrongs they did them in this life .
Parsing [sent. 4859 len. 32]: For the righteous do the wicked far more wrong than they think -- the righteous being all the time , in reality , the wealthy , and the wicked the poor .
Parsing [sent. 4860 len. 23]: But it is a blessed word that there are first that shall be last , and last that shall be first . ''
Parsing [sent. 4861 len. 3]: Helen stared .
Parsing [sent. 4862 len. 50]: This last sounded to her mere raving madness , and she thought how wrong she had been to allow such fanatics to gain power over her poor Leopold -- who sat before them whiter than ever , and with what she took for a wilder gleam in his eye .
Parsing [sent. 4863 len. 24]: `` Is there not the might of love , and all eternity for it to work in , to set things right ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4864 len. 3]: ended Polwarth .
Parsing [sent. 4865 len. 5]: `` O God ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4866 len. 10]: cried Leopold , `` if that might be true !
Parsing [sent. 4867 len. 20]: That would be a gift indeed -- the power to make up for the wrong I have done ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4868 len. 33]: He rose from the couch -- slowly , sedately , I had almost said formally , like one with a settled object , and stood erect , swaying a little from weakness .
Parsing [sent. 4869 len. 26]: `` Mr. Wingfold , '' he said , `` I want of you one more favour : will you take me to the nearest magistrate ?
Parsing [sent. 4870 len. 8]: I wish to give myself up . ''
Parsing [sent. 4871 len. 13]: Helen started up and came forward , paler than the sick man .
Parsing [sent. 4872 len. 4]: `` Mr. Wingfold !
Parsing [sent. 4873 len. 4]: Mr. Polwarth ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4874 len. 19]: she said , and turned from the one to the other , `` the boy is not himself .
Parsing [sent. 4875 len. 13]: You will never allow him to do such a mad thing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4876 len. 25]: `` It may be the right thing , '' said the curate to Leopold , `` but we must not act without consideration . ''
Parsing [sent. 4877 len. 35]: `` I have considered and considered it for days -- for weeks , '' returned Leopold ; `` but until this moment I never had the courage to resolve on the plainest of duties .
Parsing [sent. 4878 len. 66]: -- Helen , if I were to go up to the throne of God with the psalm in my mouth , and say to him , ` Against thee , thee only , have I sinned , ' it would be false ; for I have sinned against every man , woman , and child in England at least , and I will repudiate myself .
Parsing [sent. 4879 len. 27]: To the throne of God I want to go , and there is no way thither for me but through the gate of the law . ''
Parsing [sent. 4880 len. 4]: `` Leopold ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4881 len. 31]: pleaded Helen , as if for her own life with some hard judge , `` what good can it do to send another life after the one that is gone ?
Parsing [sent. 4882 len. 17]: It can not bring it back , or heal a single sorrow for its loss . ''
Parsing [sent. 4883 len. 24]: `` Except perhaps my own , '' said Leopold , in a feeble voice , but not the less in a determined tone .
Parsing [sent. 4884 len. 17]: `` Live till God send for you , '' persisted Helen , heedless of his words .
Parsing [sent. 4885 len. 32]: `` You can give your life to make up for the wrong you have done in a thousand better ways : that would be but to throw it in the dirt .
Parsing [sent. 4886 len. 11]: There is so much good waiting to be done ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4887 len. 6]: Leopold sank on the couch .
Parsing [sent. 4888 len. 22]: `` I am sitting down again , Helen , only because I am not able to stand , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4889 len. 5]: `` I WILL go .
Parsing [sent. 4890 len. 9]: Do n't talk to me about doing good !
Parsing [sent. 4891 len. 10]: Whatever I touched I should but smear with blood .
Parsing [sent. 4892 len. 12]: I want the responsibility of my own life taken off me .
Parsing [sent. 4893 len. 35]: I am like the horrible creature Frankenstein made -- one that has no right to existence -- and at the same time like the maker of it , who is accountable for that existence .
Parsing [sent. 4894 len. 14]: I am a blot on God 's creation that must be wiped off .
Parsing [sent. 4895 len. 21]: For this my strength is given back to me , and I am once more able to will and resolve .
Parsing [sent. 4896 len. 8]: You will find I can act too .
Parsing [sent. 4897 len. 17]: Helen , if you will indeed be my sister , you must NOT prevent me now .
Parsing [sent. 4898 len. 11]: I know it is hard upon you , awfully hard .
Parsing [sent. 4899 len. 18]: I know I am dragging your life down with mine , but I can not help it .
Parsing [sent. 4900 len. 30]: If I do n't do it , I shall but go out of one madness into another , ever a deeper , until the devils ca n't hold me .
Parsing [sent. 4901 len. 13]: Mr. Polwarth , is it not my duty to give myself up ?
Parsing [sent. 4902 len. 16]: Ought not the evil thing to be made manifest and swept out of the earth ?
Parsing [sent. 4903 len. 27]: Most people grant it a man 's first duty to take care of his life : that is the only thing I can do for mine .
Parsing [sent. 4904 len. 35]: It is now a filthy pool with a corpse in it : -- I would clean it out -- have the thing buried at least , though never forgotten -- never , never forgotten .
Parsing [sent. 4905 len. 18]: Then I shall die and go to God and see what he can do for me . ''
Parsing [sent. 4906 len. 11]: `` Why should you put it off till then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4907 len. 3]: said Polwarth .
Parsing [sent. 4908 len. 14]: `` Why not go to him at once and tell him all ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4909 len. 32]: As if it had been Samuel at the command of Eli , Leopold rose and crept feebly across the floor to the dressing-room , entered it , and closed the door .
Parsing [sent. 4910 len. 19]: Then Helen turned upon Wingfold with a face white as linen , and eyes flashing with troubled wrath .
Parsing [sent. 4911 len. 15]: The tigress-mother swelled in her heart , and she looked like a Maenad indeed .
Parsing [sent. 4912 len. 8]: `` Is this then your religion ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4913 len. 6]: she cried with quivering nostril .
Parsing [sent. 4914 len. 30]: `` Would he you dare to call your master have stolen into the house of a neighbour to play upon the weakness of a poor lad suffering from brain-fever ?
Parsing [sent. 4915 len. 16]: A fine trophy of your persuasive power and priestly craft you would make of him !
Parsing [sent. 4916 len. 13]: What is it to you whether he confesses his sins or not ?
Parsing [sent. 4917 len. 17]: If he confesses them to him you say is your God , is not that enough ?
Parsing [sent. 4918 len. 6]: For shame , gentlemen ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4919 len. 13]: She ceased , and stood trembling and flashing -- a human thunder-cloud .
Parsing [sent. 4920 len. 25]: Neither of the men cared to assert innocence , because , although they had not advised the step , they entirely approved of it .
Parsing [sent. 4921 len. 11]: A moment more , and her anger suddenly went out .
Parsing [sent. 4922 len. 26]: She burst into tears , and falling on her knees before the curate , begged and prayed like a child condemned to some frightful punishment .
Parsing [sent. 4923 len. 29]: It was terrible to Wingfold to see a woman in such an agony of prayer -- to one who would not grant it -- and that one himself .
Parsing [sent. 4924 len. 8]: In vain he sought to raise her .
Parsing [sent. 4925 len. 28]: `` If you do not save Leopold , I will kill myself , '' she cried , `` and my blood will be on your head . ''
Parsing [sent. 4926 len. 23]: `` The only way to save your brother is to strengthen him to do his duty , whatever that may be . ''
Parsing [sent. 4927 len. 9]: The hot fit of her mental fever returned .
Parsing [sent. 4928 len. 21]: She sprang to her feet , and her face turned again almost like that of a corpse with pale wrath .
Parsing [sent. 4929 len. 6]: `` Leave the house ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4930 len. 22]: she said , turning sharply upon Polwarth , who stood solemn and calm at Wingfold 's side , a step behind .
Parsing [sent. 4931 len. 11]: It was wonderful what an unconscious dignity radiated from him .
Parsing [sent. 4932 len. 14]: `` If my friend goes , I go too , '' said Wingfold .
Parsing [sent. 4933 len. 11]: `` But I must first tell your brother why . ''
Parsing [sent. 4934 len. 8]: He made a step towards the dressing-room .
Parsing [sent. 4935 len. 11]: But now came a fresh change of mood upon Helen .
Parsing [sent. 4936 len. 31]: She darted between him and the door , and stood there with such a look of humble entreaty as went to his very heart , and all but unmanned him .
Parsing [sent. 4937 len. 13]: Ah , how lovely she looked in the silent prayer of tears !
Parsing [sent. 4938 len. 14]: But not even her tears could turn Wingfold from what seemed his duty .
Parsing [sent. 4939 len. 14]: They could only bring answering tears from the depth of a tender heart .
Parsing [sent. 4940 len. 7]: She saw he would not flinch .
Parsing [sent. 4941 len. 17]: `` Then may God do to you as you have done to me and mine ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4942 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 4943 len. 4]: `` Amen ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4944 len. 6]: returned Wingfold and Polwarth together .
Parsing [sent. 4945 len. 17]: The door of the dressing-room opened , and out came Leopold , his white face shining .
Parsing [sent. 4946 len. 7]: `` God has heard me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4947 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 4948 len. 8]: `` How do you know that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4949 len. 12]: said his sister , in the hoarse accents of unbelieving despair .
Parsing [sent. 4950 len. 12]: `` Because he has made me strong to do my duty .
Parsing [sent. 4951 len. 26]: He has reminded me that another man may be accused of my crime , and now to conceal myself were to double my baseness . ''
Parsing [sent. 4952 len. 18]: `` It will be time enough to think of that when there is a necessity for it .
Parsing [sent. 4953 len. 18]: The thing you imagine may never happen , '' said Helen , in the same unnatural voice .
Parsing [sent. 4954 len. 37]: `` Leave it , '' cried Leopold , `` until an innocent man shall have suffered the torture and shame of a false accusation , that a guilty man may a little longer act the hypocrite !
Parsing [sent. 4955 len. 14]: No , Helen , I have not fallen so low as that yet .
Parsing [sent. 4956 len. 19]: Believe me , this is the only living hour I have had since I did the deed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4957 len. 27]: But as he spoke , the light died out of his face , and ere they could reach him he had fallen heavily on the floor .
Parsing [sent. 4958 len. 7]: `` You have killed him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4959 len. 22]: cried Helen , in a stifled shriek , for all the time she had never forgotten that her aunt might hear .
Parsing [sent. 4960 len. 13]: But the same moment she caught from his condition a lurid hope .
Parsing [sent. 4961 len. 23]: `` Go , I beg of you , '' she said -- `` by the window there , before my aunt comes .
Parsing [sent. 4962 len. 7]: She must have heard the fall .
Parsing [sent. 4963 len. 10]: There is the key of the door below . ''
Parsing [sent. 4964 len. 11]: The men obeyed , and left the house in silence .
Parsing [sent. 4965 len. 10]: It was some time before Leopold returned to consciousness .
Parsing [sent. 4966 len. 18]: He made no resistance to being again put to bed , where he lay in extreme exhaustion .
Parsing [sent. 4967 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXX .
Parsing [sent. 4968 len. 4]: THE STRONG MAN .
Parsing [sent. 4969 len. 15]: The next day he was much too exhausted and weak to talk about anything .
Parsing [sent. 4970 len. 23]: He took what his sister brought him , smiled his thanks , and once put up his hand and stroked her cheek .
Parsing [sent. 4971 len. 28]: But her heart was not gladdened by these signs of comparative composure , for what gave him quiet but the same that filled her with unspeakable horror ?
Parsing [sent. 4972 len. 14]: The day after that was Saturday , and George Bascombe came as usual .
Parsing [sent. 4973 len. 53]: The sound of his step in the hall made her dying hope once more flutter its wings : having lost the poor stay of the parson , from whom she had never expected much , she turned in her fresh despair to the cousin from whom she had never looked for anything .
Parsing [sent. 4974 len. 9]: But what was she to say to him ?
Parsing [sent. 4975 len. 30]: -- Nothing yet , she resolved ; but she would take him to see Leopold -- for was he not sure to hear that the parson had been admitted ?
Parsing [sent. 4976 len. 46]: She did not feel at all certain that she was doing right , but she would do it ; and if she left them together , possibly George might drop some good PRACTICAL advice , which , though spoken in ignorance , might yet tell .
Parsing [sent. 4977 len. 12]: George was such a healthy nature and such a sound thinker !
Parsing [sent. 4978 len. 47]: Was it not as ridiculous as horrible for any man to think he had a right to throw away his very existence , and bring disgrace upon his family as well , for a mere point of honour -- no , not honour , mere fastidiousness !
Parsing [sent. 4979 len. 23]: Leopold was better , and willing enough to see George , saying only , `` I would rather it were Mr. Wingfold .
Parsing [sent. 4980 len. 15]: But he ca n't come to-day , I suppose , to-morrow being Sunday . ''
Parsing [sent. 4981 len. 28]: George 's entrance brought with it a waft of breezy health , and a show of bodily vigour pleasant and refreshing to the heart of the invalid .
Parsing [sent. 4982 len. 23]: Kindness shone in his eyes , and his large , handsome hand was out as usual while he was yet yards away .
Parsing [sent. 4983 len. 13]: It swallowed up that of poor Leopold , and held it fast .
Parsing [sent. 4984 len. 8]: `` Come , come , old fellow !
Parsing [sent. 4985 len. 8]: What 's the meaning of this ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4986 len. 5]: he said right cheerily .
Parsing [sent. 4987 len. 18]: `` You ought to be ashamed of yourself -- lying in bed like this in such weather !
Parsing [sent. 4988 len. 19]: Why ai n't you riding in the park with Helen , instead of moping in this dark room ?
Parsing [sent. 4989 len. 23]: You 'll be as blind as the fish in the cave of Kentucky if you do n't get out of this directly !
Parsing [sent. 4990 len. 13]: We must see what we can do to get you up ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4991 len. 49]: He glanced round the room , saw that Helen had left it , and changed his tone to a lower and serious one : `` I say , my boy , you must have been playing old Harry with your constitution to bring yourself to such a pass !
Parsing [sent. 4992 len. 3]: By Jove !
Parsing [sent. 4993 len. 5]: this will never do !
Parsing [sent. 4994 len. 11]: You must turn over a new leaf , you know .
Parsing [sent. 4995 len. 7]: That sort of thing never pays .
Parsing [sent. 4996 len. 8]: The game 's not worth the candle .
Parsing [sent. 4997 len. 29]: Why , you 've been at death 's door , and life 's not so long that you can afford to play ducks and drakes with it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4998 len. 27]: Thus he talked , in expostulatory rattle , the very high-priest of social morality , for some , time before Leopold could get a word in .
Parsing [sent. 4999 len. 14]: But when he did , it turned the current into quite another channel .
Parsing [sent. 5000 len. 18]: An hour passed , and George reappeared in the drawing-room , where Helen was waiting for him .
Parsing [sent. 5001 len. 5]: He looked very grave .
Parsing [sent. 5002 len. 18]: `` I fear matters are worse with poor Leopold than I had imagined , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 5003 len. 8]: Helen gave a sad nod of acquiescence .
Parsing [sent. 5004 len. 26]: `` He 's quite off his head , '' continued George , '' -- telling me such an awful cock-and-bull story with the greatest gravity !
Parsing [sent. 5005 len. 32]: He WILL have it that he is a murderer -- the murderer of that very girl I was telling you about , you remember , -- '' `` Yes , yes !
Parsing [sent. 5006 len. 21]: I know , '' said Helen , as a faint gleam of reviving hope shot up from below her horizon .
Parsing [sent. 5007 len. 28]: George took the whole thing for a sick fancy , and who was likely to know better than he -- a lawyer , and skilled in evidence ?
Parsing [sent. 5008 len. 13]: Not a word would she say to interfere with such an opinion !
Parsing [sent. 5009 len. 14]: `` I hope you gave him a good talking-to , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 5010 len. 18]: `` Of course I did , '' he answered ; `` but it was of no use .
Parsing [sent. 5011 len. 7]: I see exactly how it is .
Parsing [sent. 5012 len. 35]: He gave me a full and circumstantial account of the affair , filling up all the gaps , it is true , but going only just as far as the newspapers supplied the skeleton .
Parsing [sent. 5013 len. 14]: How he got away , for instance , he could not tell me .
Parsing [sent. 5014 len. 10]: And now nothing will serve him but confess it !
Parsing [sent. 5015 len. 8]: He do n't care who knows it !
Parsing [sent. 5016 len. 8]: He 's as mad as a hatter !
Parsing [sent. 5017 len. 16]: -- I beg your pardon , Helen -- on that one point , I mean .
Parsing [sent. 5018 len. 12]: The moment I saw him I read madness in his eye !
Parsing [sent. 5019 len. 9]: -- What 's to be done now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5020 len. 12]: `` George , I look to you , '' said Helen .
Parsing [sent. 5021 len. 8]: `` Poor aunt is of no use .
Parsing [sent. 5022 len. 18]: Think what will become of her , if the unhappy boy should attempt to give himself up !
Parsing [sent. 5023 len. 15]: We should be the talk of the county -- of the whole country ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5024 len. 13]: `` Why did n't you tell me of this before , Helen ?
Parsing [sent. 5025 len. 11]: It must have been coming on for some time . ''
Parsing [sent. 5026 len. 11]: `` George , I did n't know what to do .
Parsing [sent. 5027 len. 17]: And I had heard you say such terrible things about the duty of punishing crime . ''
Parsing [sent. 5028 len. 6]: `` Good gracious , Helen !
Parsing [sent. 5029 len. 5]: where is your logic ?
Parsing [sent. 5030 len. 8]: What has crime to do with it !
Parsing [sent. 5031 len. 7]: Is down-right stark-staring madness a crime ?
Parsing [sent. 5032 len. 13]: Anyone with half an eye can see the boy is mad ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5033 len. 13]: Helen saw she had made a slip , and held her peace .
Parsing [sent. 5034 len. 14]: George went on : -- `` He ought to be shut up . ''
Parsing [sent. 5035 len. 3]: `` No !
Parsing [sent. 5036 len. 2]: no !
Parsing [sent. 5037 len. 3]: no ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5038 len. 12]: Helen almost screamed , and covered her face with her hands .
Parsing [sent. 5039 len. 10]: `` I 've done my best to persuade him .
Parsing [sent. 5040 len. 7]: But I will have another try .
Parsing [sent. 5041 len. 33]: That a fellow is out of his mind is no reason why he should be unassailable by good logic -- that is , if you take him on his own admissions . ''
Parsing [sent. 5042 len. 12]: `` I fear you will make nothing of him , George .
Parsing [sent. 5043 len. 18]: He is set upon it , and I do n't know what IS to be done . ''
Parsing [sent. 5044 len. 19]: George got up , went back to Leopold , and plied him with the very best of arguments .
Parsing [sent. 5045 len. 7]: But they were of no avail .
Parsing [sent. 5046 len. 30]: There was for him but one door out of hell , and that was the door of confession -- let what might lie on the other side of it .
Parsing [sent. 5047 len. 28]: `` Who knows , '' he said , `` but the law of a life for a life may have come of compassion for the murderer ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5048 len. 4]: `` Nonsense ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5049 len. 3]: said George .
Parsing [sent. 5050 len. 15]: `` It comes of the care of society over its own constituent parts . ''
Parsing [sent. 5051 len. 33]: `` Whatever it came from , I know this , '' returned Leopold , `` that , since I made up my mind to confess , I am a man again . ''
Parsing [sent. 5052 len. 4]: George was silent .
Parsing [sent. 5053 len. 12]: He found himself in that rare condition for him -- perplexity .
Parsing [sent. 5054 len. 14]: It would be most awkward if the thing came to be talked of !
Parsing [sent. 5055 len. 11]: Some would even be fools enough to believe the story !
Parsing [sent. 5056 len. 29]: Entire proof of madness would only make such set it down as the consequence -- or , if pity prevailed , then as the cause of the deed .
Parsing [sent. 5057 len. 19]: They might be compelled to shut him up , to avoid no end of the most frightful annoyances .
Parsing [sent. 5058 len. 12]: But Helen , he feared , would not consent to that .
Parsing [sent. 5059 len. 46]: And then his story was so circumstantial -- and therefore so far plausible -- that there was no doubt most magistrates would be ready at once to commit him for trial -- and then where would there be an end of the most offensive embarrassments !
Parsing [sent. 5060 len. 5]: Thus George reflected uneasily .
Parsing [sent. 5061 len. 8]: But at length an idea struck him .
Parsing [sent. 5062 len. 16]: `` Well , '' he said lightly , `` if you will , you will .
Parsing [sent. 5063 len. 14]: We must try to make it as easy for you as we can .
Parsing [sent. 5064 len. 10]: I will manage it , and go with you .
Parsing [sent. 5065 len. 10]: I know all about such things , you know .
Parsing [sent. 5066 len. 8]: But it wo n't do just to-day .
Parsing [sent. 5067 len. 25]: If you were to go before a magistrate , looking as you do now , he would not listen to a word you uttered .
Parsing [sent. 5068 len. 14]: He would only fancy you in a fever and send you to bed .
Parsing [sent. 5069 len. 51]: If you are quiet to-day -- let me see -- to-morrow is Sunday -- and if you are in the same mind on Monday , I will take you to Mr. Hooker -- he 's one of the county magistrates , and you shall make your statement to him . ''
Parsing [sent. 5070 len. 4]: `` Thank you .
Parsing [sent. 5071 len. 11]: -- I should like Mr. Wingfold to go too . ''
Parsing [sent. 5072 len. 4]: `` Soh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5073 len. 5]: said George to himself .
Parsing [sent. 5074 len. 9]: `` By all means , '' he answered .
Parsing [sent. 5075 len. 9]: `` We can take him with us . ''
Parsing [sent. 5076 len. 6]: He went again to Helen .
Parsing [sent. 5077 len. 12]: `` This is a most awkward business , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 5078 len. 4]: `` Poor girl !
Parsing [sent. 5079 len. 9]: what you must have gone through with him !
Parsing [sent. 5080 len. 5]: I had no idea !
Parsing [sent. 5081 len. 9]: But I see my way out of it .
Parsing [sent. 5082 len. 7]: Keep your mind easy , Helen .
Parsing [sent. 5083 len. 8]: I do see what I can do .
Parsing [sent. 5084 len. 16]: Only what 's the meaning of his wanting that fellow Wingfold to go with him ?
Parsing [sent. 5085 len. 17]: I should n't a bit wonder now if it all came of some of his nonsense !
Parsing [sent. 5086 len. 27]: At least , it may be that ass of a curate that has put confession in his head -- to save his soul , of course !
Parsing [sent. 5087 len. 9]: How did he come to see him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5088 len. 9]: `` The poor boy would see him . ''
Parsing [sent. 5089 len. 10]: `` What made him want to see him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5090 len. 5]: Helen held her peace .
Parsing [sent. 5091 len. 7]: She saw George suspected the truth .
Parsing [sent. 5092 len. 10]: `` Well , no matter , '' said George .
Parsing [sent. 5093 len. 11]: `` But one never knows what may come of things .
Parsing [sent. 5094 len. 8]: We ought always to look well ahead .
Parsing [sent. 5095 len. 20]: -- You had better go and lie down awhile , Helen ; you do n't seem quite yourself . ''
Parsing [sent. 5096 len. 12]: `` I am afraid to leave Leopold , '' she answered .
Parsing [sent. 5097 len. 11]: `` He will be telling aunt and everybody now . ''
Parsing [sent. 5098 len. 14]: `` That I will take care he does not , '' said George .
Parsing [sent. 5099 len. 10]: `` You go and lie down a while . ''
Parsing [sent. 5100 len. 66]: Helen 's strength had been sorely tried : she had borne up bravely to the last ; but now that she could do no more , and her brother had taken himself out of her hands , her strength had begun to give way , and , almost for the first time in her life , in daylight , she longed to go to bed .
Parsing [sent. 5101 len. 16]: Let George , or Wingfold , or who would , see to the wilful boy !
Parsing [sent. 5102 len. 7]: She had done what she could .
Parsing [sent. 5103 len. 24]: She gladly yielded to George 's suggestion , sought an unoccupied room , bolted the door , and threw herself upon the bed .
Parsing [sent. 5104 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXXI .
Parsing [sent. 5105 len. 4]: GEORGE AND LEOPOLD .
Parsing [sent. 5106 len. 14]: George went again to Leopold 's room , and sat down by him .
Parsing [sent. 5107 len. 23]: The youth lay with his eyes half closed , and a smile -- a faint sad one -- flickered over his face .
Parsing [sent. 5108 len. 14]: He was asleep : from infancy he had slept with his eyes open .
Parsing [sent. 5109 len. 4]: `` Emmeline ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5110 len. 12]: he murmured , in the tone of one who entreats forgiveness .
Parsing [sent. 5111 len. 5]: `` Strange infatuation ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5112 len. 12]: said George to himself : `` even his dreams are mad !
Parsing [sent. 5113 len. 3]: Good God !
Parsing [sent. 5114 len. 11]: there ca n't be anything in it -- can there ?
Parsing [sent. 5115 len. 13]: I begin to feel as if I were not quite safe myself .
Parsing [sent. 5116 len. 8]: Mad-doctors go mad themselves , they say .
Parsing [sent. 5117 len. 21]: I wonder what sort of floating sporule carries the infection -- reaching the brain by the nose , I fancy .
Parsing [sent. 5118 len. 23]: Or perhaps there is latent madness in us all , requiring only the presence of another madness to set it free . ''
Parsing [sent. 5119 len. 8]: Leopold was awake and looking at him .
Parsing [sent. 5120 len. 11]: `` Is it a very bad way of dying ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5121 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 5122 len. 8]: `` What is , old boy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5123 len. 4]: `` Hanging . ''
Parsing [sent. 5124 len. 24]: `` Yes , very bad -- choking , you know , '' answered George , who wanted to make the worst of it .
Parsing [sent. 5125 len. 24]: `` I thought the neck was broken and all was over , '' returned Leopold , with a slight tremor in his voice .
Parsing [sent. 5126 len. 18]: `` Yes , that 's how it ought to be ; but it fails so often ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5127 len. 21]: `` At least there 's no more hanging in public , and that 's a comfort , '' said Leopold .
Parsing [sent. 5128 len. 25]: `` What a queer thing , '' said George to himself , `` that a man should be ready to hang for an idea !
Parsing [sent. 5129 len. 33]: Why should he not do his best to enjoy what is left of the sunlight , seeing , as their own prophet says , the night cometh when no man can work ?
Parsing [sent. 5130 len. 17]: A few more whiffs of his cigar before it goes out , would hurt no one .
Parsing [sent. 5131 len. 23]: It is one thing to hang a murderer , and quite another to hang yourself if you happen to be the man .
Parsing [sent. 5132 len. 12]: But he 's stark raving mad , and must be humoured .
Parsing [sent. 5133 len. 7]: Dance upon nothing for an idea !
Parsing [sent. 5134 len. 12]: Well , it 's not without plenty of parallels in history !
Parsing [sent. 5135 len. 23]: -- I wonder whether his one idea would give way now , if it were brought to the actual test of hanging !
Parsing [sent. 5136 len. 16]: It is a pity it could n't be tried , just for experiment 's sake .
Parsing [sent. 5137 len. 8]: But a strait-waistcoat would be better . ''
Parsing [sent. 5138 len. 19]: Leopold 's acquaintance with George had been but small , and of his favourite theories he knew nothing .
Parsing [sent. 5139 len. 52]: But he had always known that he was not merely his sister 's cousin , but the trusted friend both of her and of her aunt ; and since he had come to know of his frequent visits , he had begun to believe him more to Helen than a friend .
Parsing [sent. 5140 len. 74]: Hence the moment he had made up his mind to confess , he was ready to trust George entirely , and although he was disappointed to find him receive his communication in a spirit so different from that of Wingfold and his friend , he felt no motion of distrust on that account , seeing Helen , who had been to him true as steel , took the same view of his resolution .
Parsing [sent. 5141 len. 20]: `` What would you do yourself then , George , if you had committed a crime like mine ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5142 len. 10]: he asked , after lying silent for a while .
Parsing [sent. 5143 len. 11]: None of George 's theories had greatly taxed his imagination .
Parsing [sent. 5144 len. 33]: He had not been in any habit of fancying himself in this or that situation -- and when he did , it was always in some pleasant one of victory or recognition .
Parsing [sent. 5145 len. 72]: Possible conditions of humanity other than pleasant , he had been content to regard from the outside , and come to logical conclusions concerning , without , as a German would say , thinking himself into them at all ; and it would have been to do the very idea of George Bascombe a wrong to imagine him entangled in any such net of glowing wire as a crime against society !
Parsing [sent. 5146 len. 34]: Therefore , although for most questions George had always an answer ready , for this he had none at hand , and required a moment , and but a moment , to think .
Parsing [sent. 5147 len. 31]: `` I would say to myself , '' he replied , '' ` What is done , is done , and is beyond my power to alter or help . '
Parsing [sent. 5148 len. 21]: And so I would be a man and bear it -- not a weakling , and let it crush me .
Parsing [sent. 5149 len. 5]: No , by Jove !
Parsing [sent. 5150 len. 7]: it should n't crush ME ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5151 len. 16]: `` Ah , but you have n't tried the weight of it , George ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5152 len. 3]: returned Leopold .
Parsing [sent. 5153 len. 5]: `` God forbid ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5154 len. 3]: said George .
Parsing [sent. 5155 len. 4]: `` God forbid !
Parsing [sent. 5156 len. 18]: indeed , '' rejoined Leopold ; `` but there 't is done for all his forbidding ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5157 len. 28]: `` What 's done is done , God or devil , and must be borne , I say , '' said Bascombe , stretching out his legs .
Parsing [sent. 5158 len. 14]: He was aware it sounded heartless , but how could he help it ?
Parsing [sent. 5159 len. 8]: What else was there to be said ?
Parsing [sent. 5160 len. 9]: `` But if you ca n't bear it ?
Parsing [sent. 5161 len. 11]: If it is driving you mad -- mad -- mad ?
Parsing [sent. 5162 len. 10]: If you must do something or kill yourself ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5163 len. 3]: cried Leopold .
Parsing [sent. 5164 len. 15]: `` You have n't done your best at trying yet , '' returned George .
Parsing [sent. 5165 len. 24]: `` But you are ill , and not very able to try , I daresay , and so we ca n't help it .
Parsing [sent. 5166 len. 18]: On Monday we shall go to Mr. Hooker , and see what he says to it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5167 len. 12]: He rose and went to get a book from the library .
Parsing [sent. 5168 len. 17]: On the stair he met the butler : Mr. Wingfold had called to see Mr. Lingard .
Parsing [sent. 5169 len. 8]: `` He ca n't see him to-day .
Parsing [sent. 5170 len. 56]: He is too much exhausted , '' said Bascombe ; and the curate left the house thoughtful and sorry , feeling as if a vulture had settled by the side of the youth -- a good-natured vulture , no doubt , but not the less one bent on picking out the eyes of his mind .
Parsing [sent. 5171 len. 17]: He walked away along the street towards the church with down-bent head , seeing no one .
Parsing [sent. 5172 len. 30]: He entered the churchyard , not looking whither he went : a lovely soul was in pain and peril , and he could not get near to help it .
Parsing [sent. 5173 len. 12]: They were giving it choke-damp to breathe , instead of mountain-air .
Parsing [sent. 5174 len. 26]: They were washing its sores with anodynes instead of laying them open with the knife of honesty , that they might be cleansed and healed .
Parsing [sent. 5175 len. 15]: He found himself stumbling among the level gravestones , and stopped and sat down .
Parsing [sent. 5176 len. 39]: He sat a while , seeming to think of nothing , his eyes resting on a little tuft of moss that shone like green gold in the sunlight on the shoulder of an awkward little cherub 's wing .
Parsing [sent. 5177 len. 23]: Ere long he found himself thinking how not the soul of Leopold , but that of Helen , was in chief danger .
Parsing [sent. 5178 len. 34]: Poor Leopold had the serpent of his crime to sting him alive , but Helen had the vampyre of an imperfect love to fan her asleep with the airs of a false devotion .
Parsing [sent. 5179 len. 13]: It was Helen he had to be anxious about more than Leopold .
Parsing [sent. 5180 len. 9]: He rose and walked back to the house .
Parsing [sent. 5181 len. 8]: `` Can I see Miss Lingard ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5182 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 5183 len. 11]: It was a maid who opened the door this time .
Parsing [sent. 5184 len. 12]: She showed him into the library , and went to inquire .
Parsing [sent. 5185 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXXII .
Parsing [sent. 5186 len. 4]: WINGFOLD AND HELEN .
Parsing [sent. 5187 len. 18]: When Helen lay down , she tried to sleep , but she could not even lie still .
Parsing [sent. 5188 len. 44]: For all her preference of George and his counsel , and her hope in the view he took of Leopold 's case , the mere knowledge that in the next room her cousin sat by her brother , made her anxious and restless .
Parsing [sent. 5189 len. 25]: At first it was the bare feeling that they were together -- the thing she had for so long taken such pains to prevent .
Parsing [sent. 5190 len. 31]: Next came the fear lest Leopold should succeed in persuading George that he was really guilty -- in which case , what would George , the righteous man , counsel ?
Parsing [sent. 5191 len. 42]: And last and chief of all , what hope of peace to Leopold could he in any of his counsel -- except indeed he led him up to the door of death , and urged him into the nothingness behind it ?
Parsing [sent. 5192 len. 15]: Then what if George should be wrong , and there WAS something behind it ?
Parsing [sent. 5193 len. 24]: Whatever sort of a something it might be , could the teaching of George be in the smallest measure a preparation for it ?
Parsing [sent. 5194 len. 40]: Were it not better , so far as the POSSIBILITY which remained untouched by any of George 's arguments was concerned , that Leopold should die believing after Mr. Wingfold 's fashion , and not disbelieving after George 's ?
Parsing [sent. 5195 len. 30]: If then there were nothing behind , he would be nothing the worse ; if there were , the curate might have in some sort prepared him for it .
Parsing [sent. 5196 len. 47]: And now first she began to feel that she was a little afraid of her cousin -- that she had yielded to his influence , or rather allowed him to assume upon the possession of influence , until she was aware of something that somewhere galled .
Parsing [sent. 5197 len. 17]: He was a very good fellow , but was he one fit to rule her life ?
Parsing [sent. 5198 len. 18]: Would her nature consent to look up to his always , if she were to marry him ?
Parsing [sent. 5199 len. 25]: But the thought only flitted like a cloud across the surface of her mind , for all her care was Leopold , and alas !
Parsing [sent. 5200 len. 14]: with him she was now almost angry , and it grieved her sorely .
Parsing [sent. 5201 len. 29]: All these feelings together had combined to form her mood , when her maid came to the door with the message that Mr. Wingfold was in the library .
Parsing [sent. 5202 len. 8]: She resolved at once to see him .
Parsing [sent. 5203 len. 13]: The curate 's heart trembled a little as he waited for her .
Parsing [sent. 5204 len. 41]: He was not quite sure that it was his business to tell her her duty -- yet something seemed to drive him to it : he could not bear the idea of her going on in the path of crookedness .
Parsing [sent. 5205 len. 60]: It is no easy matter for one man to tell another his duty in the simplest relations of life ; and here was a man , naturally shy and self-distrustful , daring to rebuke and instruct a woman , whose presence was mighty upon him , and whose influence was tenfold heightened by the suffering that softened her beauty !
Parsing [sent. 5206 len. 53]: She entered , troubled yet stately , doubtful , yet with a kind of half-trust in her demeanour , white , and blue-eyed , with pained mouth , and a droop of weariness and suffering in eyelids and neck -- a creature to be worshipped if only for compassion of dignified distress .
Parsing [sent. 5207 len. 45]: Thomas Wingfold 's nature was one more than usually bent towards helpfulness , but his early history , his lack of friends , of confidence , of convictions , of stand or aim in life , had hitherto prevented the outcome of that tendency .
Parsing [sent. 5208 len. 27]: But now , like issuing water , which , having found way , gathers force momently , the pent-up ministration of his soul was asserting itself .
Parsing [sent. 5209 len. 145]: Now that he understood more of the human heart , and recognised in this and that human countenance the bars of a cage through which peeped an imprisoned life , his own heart burned in him with the love of the helpless ; and if there was mingled therein anything of the ambition of benefaction , anything of the love of power , anything of self-recommendation , pride of influence , or desire to be a centre of good , and rule in a small kingdom of the aided and aiding , these marshy growths had the fairest chance of dying an obscure death ; for the one sun , potent on the wheat for life , and on the tares for death , is the face of Christ Jesus , and in that presence Wingfold lived more and more from day to day .
Parsing [sent. 5210 len. 39]: And now came Helen , who , more than anyone whose history he had yet learned -- more perhaps than even her brother , needed such help as he confidently hoped he knew now where she might find !
Parsing [sent. 5211 len. 90]: But when he saw her stand before him wounded and tearful and proud , regarding his behaviour in respect of her brother as cruel and heartless ; when he felt in his very soul that she was jealous of his influence , that she disliked and even despised him ; it was only with a strong effort he avoided assuming a manner correspondent to the idea of himself he saw reflected in her mind , and submitting himself , as it were , to be what she judged him .
Parsing [sent. 5212 len. 109]: When , however , by a pure effort of will , he rose above this weakness and looked her full and clear in the face , a new jealousy of himself arose : she stood there so lovely , so attractive , so tenfold womanly in her misery , that he found he must keep a stern watch upon himself , lest interest in her as a woman should trespass on the sphere of simple humanity , wherein with favouring distinction is recognized neither Jew nor Greek , prince nor peasant -- not even man or woman , only the one human heart that can love and suffer .
Parsing [sent. 5213 len. 77]: It aided him in this respect however , that his inherent modesty caused him to look up to Helen as to a suffering goddess , noble , grand , lovely , only ignorant of the one secret , of which he , haunting the steps of the Unbound Prometheus , had learned a few syllables , broken yet potent , which he would fain , could he find how , communicate in their potency to her .
Parsing [sent. 5214 len. 31]: And besides , to help her now looking upon him from the distant height of conscious superiority , he must persuade her to what she regarded as an unendurable degradation !
Parsing [sent. 5215 len. 24]: The circumstances assuredly protected him from any danger of offering her such expression of sympathy as might not have been welcome to her .
Parsing [sent. 5216 len. 32]: It is true that the best help a woman can get is from a right man -- equally true with its converse ; but let the man who ventures take heed .
Parsing [sent. 5217 len. 30]: Unless he is able to counsel a woman to the hardest thing that bears the name of duty , let him not dare give advice even to her asking .
Parsing [sent. 5218 len. 11]: Helen however had not come to ask advice of Wingfold .
Parsing [sent. 5219 len. 7]: She was in no such mood .
Parsing [sent. 5220 len. 27]: She was indeed weary of a losing strife , and only for a glimmer of possible help from her cousin , saw ruin inevitable before her .
Parsing [sent. 5221 len. 30]: But this revival of hope in George had roused afresh her indignation at the intrusion of Wingfold with what she chose to lay to his charge as unsought counsel .
Parsing [sent. 5222 len. 48]: At the same time , through all the indignation , terror , and dismay , something within her murmured audibly enough that the curate and not her cousin was the guide who could lead her brother where grew the herb of what peace might yet be had .
Parsing [sent. 5223 len. 21]: It was therefore with a sense of bewilderment , discord , and uncertainty , that she now entered the library .
Parsing [sent. 5224 len. 14]: Wingfold rose , made his obeisance , and advanced a step or two .
Parsing [sent. 5225 len. 18]: He would not offer a hand that might be unwelcome , and Helen did not offer hers .
Parsing [sent. 5226 len. 13]: She bent her neck graciously , and motioned him to be seated .
Parsing [sent. 5227 len. 13]: `` I hope Mr. Lingard is not worse , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 5228 len. 3]: Helen started .
Parsing [sent. 5229 len. 11]: Had anything happened while she had been away from him ?
Parsing [sent. 5230 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 5231 len. 7]: Why should he be worse ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5232 len. 3]: she answered .
Parsing [sent. 5233 len. 8]: `` Have they told you anything ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5234 len. 45]: `` I have heard nothing ; only as I was not allowed to see him , -- '' `` I left him with Mr. Bascombe half an hour ago , '' she said , willing to escape the imputation of having refused him admittance .
Parsing [sent. 5235 len. 6]: Wingfold gave an involuntary sigh .
Parsing [sent. 5236 len. 30]: `` You do not think that gentleman 's company desirable for my brother , I presume , '' she said with a smile so lustreless that it seemed bitter .
Parsing [sent. 5237 len. 21]: `` He wo n't do him any harm -- at least I do not think you need fear it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5238 len. 4]: `` Why not ?
Parsing [sent. 5239 len. 20]: No one in your profession can think his opinions harmless , and certainly he will not suppress them . ''
Parsing [sent. 5240 len. 32]: `` A man with such a weight on his soul as your brother carries , will not be ready to fancy it lightened by having lumps of lead thrown upon it .
Parsing [sent. 5241 len. 29]: An easy mind may take a shroud on its shoulders for wings , but when trouble comes and it wants to fly , then it knows the difference .
Parsing [sent. 5242 len. 10]: Leopold will not be misled by Mr. Bascombe . ''
Parsing [sent. 5243 len. 4]: Helen grew paler .
Parsing [sent. 5244 len. 14]: She would have him misled -- so far as not to betray himself .
Parsing [sent. 5245 len. 18]: `` I am far more afraid of your influence than of his , '' added the curate .
Parsing [sent. 5246 len. 13]: `` What bad influence do you suppose me likely to exercise ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5247 len. 8]: asked Helen , with a cold smile .
Parsing [sent. 5248 len. 18]: `` The bad influence of wishing him to act upon your conscience instead of his own . ''
Parsing [sent. 5249 len. 13]: `` Is my conscience then a worse one than Leopold 's ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5250 len. 14]: she asked , but as if she felt no interest in the answer .
Parsing [sent. 5251 len. 11]: `` It is not his , and that is enough .
Parsing [sent. 5252 len. 15]: His own and no other can tell him what he ought to do . ''
Parsing [sent. 5253 len. 11]: `` Why not leave him to it , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5254 len. 4]: she said bitterly .
Parsing [sent. 5255 len. 12]: `` That is what I want of you , Miss Lingard .
Parsing [sent. 5256 len. 15]: I would have you fear to touch the life of the poor youth . ''
Parsing [sent. 5257 len. 5]: `` Touch his life !
Parsing [sent. 5258 len. 9]: I would give him mine to save it .
Parsing [sent. 5259 len. 9]: YOU counsel him to throw it away . ''
Parsing [sent. 5260 len. 12]: `` Alas , what different meanings we put on the word !
Parsing [sent. 5261 len. 46]: You call the few years he may have to live in this world his life ; while I -- '' `` While you count it the millions of which yon know nothing , -- somewhere whence no one has ever returned to bring any news !
Parsing [sent. 5262 len. 16]: -- a wretched life at best if it be such as you represent it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5263 len. 16]: `` Pardon me , that is merely what you suppose I mean by the word .
Parsing [sent. 5264 len. 12]: I do not mean that ; I mean something altogether different .
Parsing [sent. 5265 len. 19]: When I spoke of his life , I thought nothing about here or there , now or then .
Parsing [sent. 5266 len. 40]: You will see what I mean if you think how the light came back to his eye and the colour to his cheek the moment he had made up his mind to do what had long seemed his duty .
Parsing [sent. 5267 len. 23]: When I saw him again that light was still in his eyes , and a feeble hope looked out of every feature .
Parsing [sent. 5268 len. 47]: Existence , from a demon-haunted vapor , had begun to change to a morning of spring ; life , the life of conscious well-being , of law and order and peace , had begun to dawn in obedience and self-renunciation ; his resurrection was at hand .
Parsing [sent. 5269 len. 28]: But you then , and now you and Mr. Bascombe , would stop this resurrection ; you would seat yourselves upon his gravestone to keep him down !
Parsing [sent. 5270 len. 4]: -- And why ?
Parsing [sent. 5271 len. 26]: -- Lest he , lest you , lest your family should be disgraced by letting him out of his grave to tell the truth . ''
Parsing [sent. 5272 len. 4]: `` Sir ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5273 len. 14]: cried Helen , indignantly drawing herself to her full height and something more .
Parsing [sent. 5274 len. 8]: Wingfold took one step nearer to her .
Parsing [sent. 5275 len. 40]: `` My calling is to speak the truth , '' he said : `` and I am bound to warn you that you will never be at peace in your own soul until you love your brother aright . ''
Parsing [sent. 5276 len. 6]: `` Love my brother ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5277 len. 4]: Helen almost screamed .
Parsing [sent. 5278 len. 8]: `` I would die for him . ''
Parsing [sent. 5279 len. 19]: `` Then at least let your pride die for him , '' said Wingfold , not without indignation .
Parsing [sent. 5280 len. 10]: Helen left the room , and Wingfold the house .
Parsing [sent. 5281 len. 28]: She had hardly shut the door , and fallen again upon the bed , when she began to know in her heart that the curate was right .
Parsing [sent. 5282 len. 21]: But the more she knew it , the less would she confess it even to herself : it was unendurable .
Parsing [sent. 5283 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXXIII .
Parsing [sent. 5284 len. 3]: A REVIEW .
Parsing [sent. 5285 len. 31]: The curate walked hurriedly home , and seated himself at his table , where yet lay his Greek Testament open at the passage he had been pondering for his sermon .
Parsing [sent. 5286 len. 2]: Alas !
Parsing [sent. 5287 len. 12]: all he had then been thinking with such fervour had vanished .
Parsing [sent. 5288 len. 12]: He knew his inspiring text , but the rest was gone .
Parsing [sent. 5289 len. 22]: Worst of all , feeling was gone with thought , and was , for the time at least , beyond recall .
Parsing [sent. 5290 len. 23]: Righteous as his anger was , it had ruffled the mirror of his soul till it could no longer reflect heavenly things .
Parsing [sent. 5291 len. 15]: He rose , caught up his New Testament , and went to the church-yard .
Parsing [sent. 5292 len. 29]: It was a still place , and since the pains of a new birth had come upon him , he had often sought the shelter of its calm .
Parsing [sent. 5293 len. 45]: A few yards from the wall of the rectory garden stood an old yew-tree , and a little nearer on one side was a small thicket of cypress ; between these and the wall was an ancient stone upon which he generally seated himself .
Parsing [sent. 5294 len. 12]: It had already begun to be called the curate 's chair .
Parsing [sent. 5295 len. 51]: Most imagined him drawn thither by a clerical love of gloom , but in that case he could scarcely have had such delight in seeing the sky through the dark foliage of the yew : he thought the parts so seen looked more divinely blue than any of the rest .
Parsing [sent. 5296 len. 43]: He would have admitted , however , that he found quiet , for the soul as well as the body , upon this edge of the world , this brink of the gulf that swallowed the ever-pouring ever-vanishing Niagara of human life .
Parsing [sent. 5297 len. 11]: On the stone he now seated himself and fell a-musing .
Parsing [sent. 5298 len. 41]: What a change had come upon him -- slow , indeed , yet how vast , since the night when he sat in the same churchyard indignant and uneasy with the words of Bascombe like hot coals in his heart !
Parsing [sent. 5299 len. 35]: He had been made ashamed of himself who had never thought much of himself , but the more he had lost of worthiness in his own eyes the more he had gained in worth .
Parsing [sent. 5300 len. 21]: And the more his poor satisfaction with himself had died out , the more the world had awaked around him .
Parsing [sent. 5301 len. 27]: For it must be remembered that a little conceit is no more to be endured than a great one , but must be swept utterly away .
Parsing [sent. 5302 len. 23]: Sky and wind and water and birds and trees said to him , `` Forget thyself and we will think of thee .
Parsing [sent. 5303 len. 28]: Sing no more to thyself thy foolish songs of decay , and we will all sing to thee of love and hope and faith and resurrection . ''
Parsing [sent. 5304 len. 31]: Earth and air had grown full of hints and sparkles and vital motions , as if between them and his soul an abiding community of fundamental existence had manifested itself .
Parsing [sent. 5305 len. 53]: He had never in the old days that were so near and yet seemed so far behind him , consciously cared for the sunlight : now even the shadows were marvellous in his eyes , and the glitter the golden weather-cock on the tower was like a cry of the prophet Isaiah .
Parsing [sent. 5306 len. 81]: High and alone in the clear blue air it swung , an endless warning to him that veers with the wind of the world , the words of men , the summer breezes of their praise , or the bitter blasts of their wintry blame ; it was no longer to him a cock of the winds , but a cock of the truth -- a Peter-cock , that crew aloud in golden shine its rebuke of cowardice and lying .
Parsing [sent. 5307 len. 48]: Never before had he sought acquaintance with the flowers that came dreaming up out of the earth in the woods and the lanes like a mist of loveliness , but the spring-time came in his own soul , and then he knew the children of the spring .
Parsing [sent. 5308 len. 46]: And as the joy of the reviving world found its way into the throats of the birds , so did the spring in his reviving soul find its way into the channels of thought and speech , and issue in utterance both rhythmic and melodious .
Parsing [sent. 5309 len. 26]: -- But not in any , neither in all of these things lay the chief sign and embodiment of the change he recognised in himself .
Parsing [sent. 5310 len. 81]: It was this : that , whereas in former times the name Christ had been to him little more than a dull theological symbol , the thought of him and of his thoughts was now constantly with him ; ever and anon some fresh light would break from the cloudy halo that enwrapped his grandeur ; ever was he growing more the Son of Man to his loving heart , ever more the Son of God to his aspiring spirit .
Parsing [sent. 5311 len. 29]: Testimony had merged almost in vision : he saw into , and partly understood the perfection it presented : he looked upon the face of God and lived .
Parsing [sent. 5312 len. 61]: Oftener and oftener , as the days passed , did it seem as if the man were by his side , and at times , in the stillness of the summer-eve , when he walked alone , it seemed almost , as thoughts of revealing arose in his heart , that the Master himself was teaching him in spoken words .
Parsing [sent. 5313 len. 18]: What need now to rack his soul in following the dim-seen , ever evanishing paths of metaphysics !
Parsing [sent. 5314 len. 69]: he had but to obey the prophet of life , the man whose being and doing and teaching were blended in one three-fold harmony , or rather , were the three-fold analysis of one white essence -- he had but to obey him , haunt his footsteps , and hearken after the sound of his spirit , and all truth would in healthy process be unfolded in himself .
Parsing [sent. 5315 len. 82]: What philosophy could carry him where Jesus would carry his obedient friends -- into his own peace , namely , far above all fear and all hate , where his soul should breathe such a high atmosphere of strength at once and repose , that he should love even his enemies , and that with no such love as condescendingly overlooks , but with the real , hearty , and self-involved affection that would die to give them the true life !
Parsing [sent. 5316 len. 2]: Alas !
Parsing [sent. 5317 len. 25]: how far was he from such perfection now -- from such a martyrdom , lovely as endless , in the consuming fire of God !
Parsing [sent. 5318 len. 23]: And at the thought , he fell from the heights of his contemplation -- but was caught in the thicket of prayer .
Parsing [sent. 5319 len. 18]: By the time he reached his lodging , the glow had vanished , but the mood remained .
Parsing [sent. 5320 len. 33]: He sat down and wrote the first sketch of the following verses , then found that his sermon had again drawn nigh , and was within the reach of his spiritual tentacles .
Parsing [sent. 5321 len. 31]: Father , I cry to thee for bread , With hungered longing , eager prayer ; Thou hear ` st , and givest me instead More hunger and a half-despair .
Parsing [sent. 5322 len. 6]: O Lord , how long ?
Parsing [sent. 5323 len. 31]: My days decline ; My youth is lapped in memories old ; I need not bread alone , but wine -- See , cup and hand to thee I hold .
Parsing [sent. 5324 len. 18]: And yet thou givest : thanks , O Lord , That still my heart with hunger faints !
Parsing [sent. 5325 len. 15]: The day will come when at thy board I sit forgetting all my plaints .
Parsing [sent. 5326 len. 35]: If rain must come and winds must blow , And I pore long o'er dim-seen chart , Yet , Lord , let not the hunger go , And keep the faintness at my heart .
Parsing [sent. 5327 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXXIV .
Parsing [sent. 5328 len. 5]: A SERMON TO LEOPOLD .
Parsing [sent. 5329 len. 19]: When the curate stood up to read , his eyes as of themselves sought Mrs. Ramshorn 's pew .
Parsing [sent. 5330 len. 21]: There sat Helen , with a look that revealed , he thought , more of determination and less of suffering .
Parsing [sent. 5331 len. 31]: Her aunt was by her side , cold and glaring , an ecclesiastical puss , ready to spring upon any small church-mouse that dared squeak in its own murine way .
Parsing [sent. 5332 len. 11]: Bascombe was not visible , and that was a relief .
Parsing [sent. 5333 len. 52]: For an unbelieving face , whether the dull dining countenance of a mayor , or the keen searching countenance of a barrister , is a sad bone in the throat of utterance , and has to be of set will passed over , and , if that may be , forgotten .
Parsing [sent. 5334 len. 45]: Wingfold tried hard to forget Mrs. Ramshorn 's , and one or two besides , and by the time he came to the sermon , thought of nothing but human hearts , their agonies , and him who came to call them to him .
Parsing [sent. 5335 len. 15]: `` I came not to call the righteous , but sinners to repentance . ''
Parsing [sent. 5336 len. 21]: `` Was it then of the sinners first our Lord thought ere he came from the bosom of the Father ?
Parsing [sent. 5337 len. 38]: Did the perfect will embrace in the all-atoning tenderness of the divine heart , the degraded , disfigured , defiled , distorted thing , whose angel is too blind ever to see the face of its Father ?
Parsing [sent. 5338 len. 34]: Through all the hideous filth of the charnel-house , which the passions had heaped upon her , did the Word recognise the bound , wing-lamed , feather-draggled Psyche , panting in horriblest torture ?
Parsing [sent. 5339 len. 38]: Did he have a desire to the work of his hands , the child of his father 's heart , and therefore , strong in compassion , speed to the painful rescue of hearts like his own ?
Parsing [sent. 5340 len. 18]: That purity arid defilement should thus meet across all the great dividing gulf of law and morals !
Parsing [sent. 5341 len. 7]: The friend of publicans and sinners !
Parsing [sent. 5342 len. 9]: Think : he was absolutely friendly with them !
Parsing [sent. 5343 len. 6]: was not shocked at them !
Parsing [sent. 5344 len. 7]: held up no hands of dismay !
Parsing [sent. 5345 len. 8]: Only they must do so no more .
Parsing [sent. 5346 len. 36]: `` If he were to come again , visibly , now , which do you think would come crowding around him in greater numbers -- the respectable church-goers , or the people from the slums ?
Parsing [sent. 5347 len. 5]: I do not know .
Parsing [sent. 5348 len. 5]: I dare not judge .
Parsing [sent. 5349 len. 43]: But the fact that the church draws so few of those that are despised , of those whom Jesus drew and to whom most expressly he came , gives ground for question as to how far the church is like her Lord .
Parsing [sent. 5350 len. 42]: Certainly many a one would find the way to the feet of the master , from whom the respectable church-goer , the pharisee of our time , and the priest who stands on his profession , would draw back with disgust .
Parsing [sent. 5351 len. 83]: And doubtless it would be in the religious world that a man like Jesus , who , without a professional education , a craftsman by birth and early training , uttered scarce a phrase endorsed by clerical use , or a word of the religious cant of the day , but taught in simplest natural forms the eternal facts of faith and hope and love , would meet with the chief and perhaps the only BITTER opponents of his doctrine and life .
Parsing [sent. 5352 len. 10]: `` But did our Lord not call the righteous ?
Parsing [sent. 5353 len. 51]: Did he not call honest men about him -- James and John and Simon -- sturdy fisher-folk , who faced the night and the storm , worked hard , fared roughly , lived honestly , and led good cleanly lives with father and mother , or with wife and children ?
Parsing [sent. 5354 len. 21]: I do not know that he said anything special to convince them that they were sinners before he called them .
Parsing [sent. 5355 len. 46]: But it is to be remarked that one of the first effects of his company upon Simon Peter was , that the fisherman grew ashamed of himself , and while ashamed was yet possessed with an impulse of openness and honesty no less than passionate .
Parsing [sent. 5356 len. 17]: The pure man should not be deceived as to what sort of company he was in !
Parsing [sent. 5357 len. 16]: ` Depart from me , for I am a sinful man , O Lord ! '
Parsing [sent. 5358 len. 24]: I would I could clearly behold with my mind 's eye what he then saw in Jesus that drew from him that cry !
Parsing [sent. 5359 len. 24]: fle knew him for the Messiah : what was the working of the carpenter upon the fisherman that satisfied him of the fact ?
Parsing [sent. 5360 len. 18]: Would the miracle have done it but for the previous talk from the boat to the people ?
Parsing [sent. 5361 len. 4]: I think not .
Parsing [sent. 5362 len. 37]: Anyhow St. Peter judged himself among the sinners , and we may be sure that if these fishers had been self-satisfied men , they would not have left all and gone after him who called them .
Parsing [sent. 5363 len. 16]: Still it would hardly seern that it was specially as sinners that he did so .
Parsing [sent. 5364 len. 75]: Again , did not men such as the Lord himself regarded as righteous come to him -- Nicodemus , Nathaniel , the young man who came running and kneeled to him , the scribe who was not far from the kingdom , the centurion , in whom he found more faith than in any Jew , he who had built a synagogue in Capernaum , and sculptured on its lintel the pot of manna ?
Parsing [sent. 5365 len. 15]: These came to him , and we know he was ready to receive them .
Parsing [sent. 5366 len. 56]: But he knew such would always come drawn of the Father ; they did not want much calling ; they were not so much in his thoughts therefore ; he was not troubled about them ; they were as the ninety and nine , the elder son at home , the money in the purse .
Parsing [sent. 5367 len. 22]: Doubtless they had much to learn , were not yet in the kingdom , but they were crowding about its door .
Parsing [sent. 5368 len. 18]: If I set it forth aright , I know not , but thus it looks to me .
Parsing [sent. 5369 len. 27]: And one thing I can not forget -- it meets me in the face -- that some at least , -- who knows if not all ?
Parsing [sent. 5370 len. 13]: -- of the purest of men have counted themselves the greatest sinners !
Parsing [sent. 5371 len. 48]: Neither can I forget that other saying of our Lord , a stumbling-block to many -- our Lord was not so careful as perhaps some would have had him , lest men should stumble at the truth -- The first shall be last and the last first .
Parsing [sent. 5372 len. 68]: While our Lord spoke the words : The time cometh that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth God service , even then was Saul of Tarsus at the feet of Gamaliel , preparing to do God that service ; but like one born out of due time , after all the rest he saw the Lord , and became the chief in labour and suffering .
Parsing [sent. 5373 len. 6]: Thus the last became first .
Parsing [sent. 5374 len. 61]: And I bethink me that the beloved disciple , who leaned on the bosom of the Lord , who was bolder to ask him than any -- with the boldness of love , he whom the meek and lowly called a Son of Thunder , was the last of all to rejoin the master in the mansions of his Father .
Parsing [sent. 5375 len. 11]: Last or first -- if only we are with him !
Parsing [sent. 5376 len. 18]: One thing is clear that in the order of the Lord 's business , first came sinners .
Parsing [sent. 5377 len. 27]: `` Who that reflects can fail to see this at least , that a crime brings a man face to face with the reality of things ?
Parsing [sent. 5378 len. 69]: He who knows himself a sinner -- I do not mean as one of the race -- the most self-righteous man will allow that as a man he is a sinner -- he to whom , in the words of the communion service , the remembrance of his sins is grievous , and the burden of them intolerable , knows in himself that he is a lost man .
Parsing [sent. 5379 len. 45]: He can no more hold up his head among his kind ; he can not look a woman or a child in the face ; he can not be left alone with the chaos of his thoughts , and the monsters it momently breeds .
Parsing [sent. 5380 len. 16]: The joys of his childhood , the delights of existence , are gone from him .
Parsing [sent. 5381 len. 12]: There dwells within him an ever present judgment and fiery indignation .
Parsing [sent. 5382 len. 26]: Such a man will start at the sound of pardon and peace , even as the camel of the desert at the scent of water .
Parsing [sent. 5383 len. 101]: Therefore surely is such a man nearer to the gate of the kingdom than he against whom the world has never wagged a tongue , who never sinned against a social custom even , and has as easy a conscience as the day he was born ; but who knows so little of himself that , while he thinks he is good enough , he carries within him the capacity and possibility of every cardinal sin , waiting only the special and fitting temptation which , like the match to the charged mine , shall set all in a roar !
Parsing [sent. 5384 len. 79]: Of this danger he knows nothing , never dreams of praying against it , takes his seat in his pew Sunday after Sunday with his family , nor ever murmurs Lead us not into temptation with the least sense that temptation is a frightful thing , but repeats and responds and listens in perfect self-satisfaction , doubting never that a world made up of such as he must be a pleasant sight in the eyes of the Perfect .
Parsing [sent. 5385 len. 23]: There are men who will never see what they are capable or in danger of until they have committed some fearful wrong .
Parsing [sent. 5386 len. 42]: Nay there are some for whom even that is not enough ; they must be found out by their fellow-men , and scorned in the eyes of the world , before they can or will admit or comprehend their own disgrace .
Parsing [sent. 5387 len. 8]: And there are worse still than these .
Parsing [sent. 5388 len. 21]: `` But a man may be oppressed by his sins , and hardly know what it is that oppresses him .
Parsing [sent. 5389 len. 14]: There is more of sin in our burdens than we are ourselves aware .
Parsing [sent. 5390 len. 12]: It needs not that we should have committed any grievous fault .
Parsing [sent. 5391 len. 73]: Do we recognize in ourselves that which needs to be set right , that of which we ought to be ashamed , something which , were we lifted above all worldly anxieties , would yet keep us uneasy , dissatisfied , take the essential gladness out of the sunlight , make the fair face of the earth indifferent to us , a trustful glance a discomposing look , and death a darkness ?
Parsing [sent. 5392 len. 39]: -- I say to the man who feels thus , whatever he may have done or left undone , he is not so far from the kingdom of heaven but that he may enter thereinto if he will .
Parsing [sent. 5393 len. 50]: `` And if there be here any soul withered up with dismay , torn with horrible wonder that he should have done the deed which he yet hath done , to him I say -- Flee from the self that hath sinned and hide thee with Christ in God .
Parsing [sent. 5394 len. 95]: Or if the words sound to thee as the words of some unknown tongue , and I am to thee as one that beateth the air , I say instead -- Call aloud in thy agony , that , if there be a God , he may hear the voice of his child , and put forth his hand and lay hold upon him , and rend from him the garment that clings and poisons and burns , squeeze the black drop from his heart , and set him weeping like a summer rain .
Parsing [sent. 5395 len. 28]: O blessed , holy , lovely repentance to which the Son of Man , the very root and man of men , hath come to call us !
Parsing [sent. 5396 len. 9]: Good it is , and I know it .
Parsing [sent. 5397 len. 24]: Come and repent with me , O heart wounded by thine own injustice and wrong , and together we will seek the merciful .
Parsing [sent. 5398 len. 19]: Think not about thy sin so as to make it either less or greater in thine own eyes .
Parsing [sent. 5399 len. 17]: Bring it to Jesus , and let him show thee how vile a thing it is .
Parsing [sent. 5400 len. 58]: And leave it to him to judge thee -- sure that he will judge thee justly , extenuating nothing , for he hath to cleanse thee utterly , and yet forgetting no smallest excuse that may cover the amazement of thy guilt , or witness for thee that not with open eyes didst thou do the deed .
Parsing [sent. 5401 len. 18]: At the last he cried , Father forgive them , for they know not what they do .
Parsing [sent. 5402 len. 21]: For his enemies the truth should be spoken , his first words when they had nailed him to the cross .
Parsing [sent. 5403 len. 48]: But again I say , let it be Christ that excuseth thee ; he will do it to more purpose than thou , and will not wrong thy soul by excusing thee a hair too much , or thy heart by excusing thee a hair too little .
Parsing [sent. 5404 len. 12]: `` I dreamed once that I had committed a terrible crime .
Parsing [sent. 5405 len. 20]: Carried beyond myself by passion , I knew not at the moment HOW evil was the thing I did .
Parsing [sent. 5406 len. 7]: But I knew it was evil .
Parsing [sent. 5407 len. 22]: And suddenly I became aware , when it was too late , of the nature of that which I had done .
Parsing [sent. 5408 len. 19]: The horror that came with the knowledge was of the things that belong only to the secret soul .
Parsing [sent. 5409 len. 33]: I was the same man as before I did it , yet was I now a man of whom my former self could not have conceived the possibility as dwelling within it .
Parsing [sent. 5410 len. 32]: The former self seemed now by contrast lovely in purity , yet out of that seeming purity this fearful , foul _ I _ of the present had just been born !
Parsing [sent. 5411 len. 17]: The face of my fellow-man was an avenging law , the face of a just enemy .
Parsing [sent. 5412 len. 11]: Where , how , should the frightful face be hidden ?
Parsing [sent. 5413 len. 20]: The conscious earth must take it into its wounded bosom , and that before the all-seeing daylight should come .
Parsing [sent. 5414 len. 22]: But it would come , and I should stand therein pointed at by every ray that shot through the sunny atmosphere !
Parsing [sent. 5415 len. 21]: `` The agony was of its own kind , and I have no word to tell what it was like .
Parsing [sent. 5416 len. 17]: An evil odour and a sickening pain combined , might be a symbol of the torture .
Parsing [sent. 5417 len. 51]: As is in the nature of dreams , possibly I lay but a little second on the rack , yet an age seemed shot through and through with the burning meshes of that crime , while , cowering and terror-stricken , I tossed about the loathsome fact in my mind .
Parsing [sent. 5418 len. 22]: I had DONE it , and from the done there was no escape : it was for evermore a thing done .
Parsing [sent. 5419 len. 9]: -- Came a sudden change : I awoke .
Parsing [sent. 5420 len. 26]: The sun stained with glory the curtains of my room , and the light of light darted keen as an arrow into my very soul .
Parsing [sent. 5421 len. 4]: Glory to God !
Parsing [sent. 5422 len. 4]: I was innocent !
Parsing [sent. 5423 len. 8]: The stone was rolled from my sepulchre .
Parsing [sent. 5424 len. 18]: With the darkness whence it had sprung , the cloud of my crime went heaving lurid away .
Parsing [sent. 5425 len. 13]: I was a creature of the light and not of the dark .
Parsing [sent. 5426 len. 23]: For me the sun shone and the wind blew ; for me the sea roared and the flowers sent up their odours .
Parsing [sent. 5427 len. 9]: For me the earth had nothing to hide .
Parsing [sent. 5428 len. 42]: My guilt was wiped away ; there was no red worm gnawing at my heart ; I could look my neighbour in the face , and the child of my friend might lay his hand in mine and not be defiled !
Parsing [sent. 5429 len. 15]: All day long the joy of that deliverance kept surging on in my soul .
Parsing [sent. 5430 len. 73]: `` But something yet more precious , more lovely than such an awaking , will repentance be to the sinner ; for after all it was but a dream of the night from which that set me free , and the spectre-deed that vanished had never had a place in the world of fact ; while the horror from which repentance delivers , is no dream , but a stubborn abiding reality .
Parsing [sent. 5431 len. 63]: Again , the vanishing vision leaves the man what he was before , still capable it may be of committing the crime from which he is not altogether clean to whom in his sleep it was possible : repentance makes of the man a new creature , one who has awaked from the sleep of sin to sleep that sleep no more .
Parsing [sent. 5432 len. 17]: The change in the one case is not for greatness comparable with that in the other .
Parsing [sent. 5433 len. 119]: The sun that awakes from the one sleep , is but the outward sun of our earthly life -- a glorious indeed and lovely thing , which yet even now is gathering a crust of darkness , blotting itself out and vanishing : the sun that awakes a man from the sleep of death is the living Sun that casts from his thought out into being that other sun , with the space wherein it holds planetary court -- the Father of lights , before whose shining in the inner world of truth eternal , even the deeds of vice become as spectral dreams , and , with the night of godlessness that engendered them , flee away .
Parsing [sent. 5434 len. 23]: `` But a man may answer and say to me -- ` Thou art but borne on the wings of thine imagination .
Parsing [sent. 5435 len. 30]: The fact of the crime remains , let a man tear out his heart in repentance , and no awaking can restore an innocence which is indeed lost . '
Parsing [sent. 5436 len. 35]: I answer : The words thou speakest are in themselves true , yet thy ignorance makes them false , Thou knowest not the power of God , nor what resurrection from the dead means .
Parsing [sent. 5437 len. 53]: What if , while it restored not thy former innocence , it brought thee a purity by the side of whose white splendour and inward preciousness , the innocence thou hadst lost was but a bauble , being but a thing that turned to dross in the first furnace of its temptation ?
Parsing [sent. 5438 len. 44]: Innocence is indeed priceless -- that innocence which God counteth innocence , but thine was a flimsy show , a bit of polished and cherished glass -- instead of which , if thou repentest , thou shalt in thy jewel-box find a diamond .
Parsing [sent. 5439 len. 44]: Is thy purity , O fair Psyche of the social world , upon whose wings no spattering shower has yet cast an earthy stain , and who knowest not yet whether there be any such thing as repentance or need of the same !
Parsing [sent. 5440 len. 49]: -- is thy purity to compare with the purity of that heavenly Psyche , twice born , who even now in the twilight-slumbers of heaven , dreams that she washes with her tears the feet of her Lord , and wipes them with the hairs of her head ?
Parsing [sent. 5441 len. 14]: O bountiful God , who wilt give us back even our innocence tenfold !
Parsing [sent. 5442 len. 28]: He can give an awaking that leaves the past of the soul ten times farther behind than ever waking from sleep left the dreams of the night .
Parsing [sent. 5443 len. 77]: `` If the potency of that awaking lay in the inrush of a new billow of life , fresh from its original source , carrying with it an enlargement of the whole nature and its every part , a glorification of every faculty , every sense even , so that the man , forgetting nothing of his past or its shame , should yet cry out in the joy of his second birth : ` Lo !
Parsing [sent. 5444 len. 29]: I am a new man ; I am no more he who did that awful and evil thing , for I am no more capable of doing it !
Parsing [sent. 5445 len. 10]: God be praised , for all is well ! '
Parsing [sent. 5446 len. 55]: -- would not such an awaking send the past afar into the dim distance of the first creation , and wrap the ill deed in the clean linen cloth of forgiveness , even as the dull creature of the sea rolls up the grain of intruding sand in the lovely garment of a pearl ?
Parsing [sent. 5447 len. 23]: Such an awaking means God himself in the soul , not disdaining closest vital company with the creature he foresaw and created .
Parsing [sent. 5448 len. 15]: And the man knows in full content that he is healed of his plague .
Parsing [sent. 5449 len. 49]: Nor would he willingly lose the scars which record its outbreak , for they tell him what he is without God , and set him ever looking to see that the door into the heavenly garden stands wide for God to enter the house when it pleases him .
Parsing [sent. 5450 len. 32]: And who can tell whether , in the train of such an awaking , may not follow a thousand opportunities and means of making amends to those whom he has injured ?
Parsing [sent. 5451 len. 43]: `` Nor must I fail to remind the man who has committed no grievous crime , that except he has repented of his evil self , and abjured all wrong , he is not safe from any , even the worst offence .
Parsing [sent. 5452 len. 49]: There was a time when I could not understand that he who loved not his brother was a murderer : now I see it to be no figure of speech , but , in the realities of man 's moral and spiritual nature , an absolute simple fact .
Parsing [sent. 5453 len. 17]: The murderer and the unloving sit on the same bench before the judge of eternal truth .
Parsing [sent. 5454 len. 42]: The man who loves not his brother , I do not say is at this moment capable of killing him , but if the natural working of his unlove be not checked , he will assuredly become capable of killing him .
Parsing [sent. 5455 len. 30]: Until we love our brother , yes , until we love our enemy , who is yet our brother , we contain within ourselves the undeveloped germ of murder .
Parsing [sent. 5456 len. 14]: And so with every sin in the tables or out of the tables .
Parsing [sent. 5457 len. 30]: There is not one in this congregation who has a right to cast a look of reproach at the worst felon who ever sat in the prisoners ' dock .
Parsing [sent. 5458 len. 9]: I speak no hyperbole , but simple truth .
Parsing [sent. 5459 len. 42]: We are very ready to draw in our minds a distinction between respectable sins -- human imperfections we call them , perhaps -- and disreputable vices , such as theft and murder ; but there is no such distinction in fact .
Parsing [sent. 5460 len. 22]: Many a thief is a better man than many a clergyman , and miles nearer to the gate of the kingdom .
Parsing [sent. 5461 len. 26]: The heavenly order goes upon other principles than ours , and there are first that shall be last , and last that shall be first .
Parsing [sent. 5462 len. 12]: Only , at the root of all human bliss lies repentance .
Parsing [sent. 5463 len. 47]: `` Come then at the call of the Water , the Healer , the Giver of repentance and light , the Friend of publicans and sinners , all ye on whom lies the weight of a sin , or the gathered heap of a thousand crimes .
Parsing [sent. 5464 len. 17]: He came to call such as you , that he might make you clear and clean .
Parsing [sent. 5465 len. 21]: He can not bear that you should live on in such misery , such badness , such blackness of darkness .
Parsing [sent. 5466 len. 14]: He would give you again your life , the bliss of your being .
Parsing [sent. 5467 len. 24]: He will not speak to you one word of reproach , except indeed you should aim at justifying yourselves by accusing your neighbour .
Parsing [sent. 5468 len. 29]: He will leave it to those who cherish the same sins in their hearts to cast stones at you : he who has no sin casts no stone .
Parsing [sent. 5469 len. 29]: Heartily he loves you , heartily he hates the evil in you -- so heartily that he will even cast you into the fire to burn you clean .
Parsing [sent. 5470 len. 10]: By making you clean he will give you rest .
Parsing [sent. 5471 len. 28]: If he upbraid , it will not be for past sin , but for the present little faith , holding out to him an acorn-cup to fill .
Parsing [sent. 5472 len. 69]: The rest of you keep aloof , if you will , until you shall have done some deed that compels you to cry out for deliverance ; but you that know yourselves sinners , come to him that he may work in you his perfect work , for he came not to call the righteous , but sinners , us , you and me , to repentance . ''

Parsing [sent. 5474 len. 3]: VOL III .
Parsing [sent. 5475 len. 3]: CHAPTER I .
Parsing [sent. 5476 len. 4]: AFTER THE SERMON .
Parsing [sent. 5477 len. 32]: As the sermon drew to a close , and the mist of his emotion began to disperse , individual faces of his audience again dawned out on the preacher 's ken .
Parsing [sent. 5478 len. 7]: Mr. Drew 's head was down .
Parsing [sent. 5479 len. 92]: As I have always said , certain things he had been taught in his youth , and had practised in his manhood , certain mean ways counted honest enough in the trade , had become to him , regarded from the ideal point of the divine in merchandize -- such a merchandize , namely , as the share the son of man might have taken in buying and selling , had his reputed father been a shop-keeper instead of a carpenter -- absolutely hateful , and the memory of them intolerable .
Parsing [sent. 5480 len. 51]: Nor did it relieve him much to remind himself of the fact , that he knew not to the full the nature of the advantages he took , for he knew that he had known them such as shrunk from the light , not coming thereto to be made manifest .
Parsing [sent. 5481 len. 66]: He was now doing his best to banish them from his business , and yet they were a painful presence to his spirit -- so grievous to be borne , that the prospect held out by the preacher of an absolute and final deliverance from them by the indwelling presence of the God of all living men and true merchants , was a blessedness unspeakable .
Parsing [sent. 5482 len. 23]: Small was the suspicion in the Abbey Church of Olaston that morning , that the well-known successful man of business was weeping .
Parsing [sent. 5483 len. 32]: Who could once have imagined another reason for the laying of that round , good-humoured , contented face down on the book-board , than pure drowsiness from lack of work-day interest !
Parsing [sent. 5484 len. 12]: Yet there was a human soul crying out after its birthright .
Parsing [sent. 5485 len. 9]: Oh , to be clean as a mountain-river !
Parsing [sent. 5486 len. 14]: clean as the air above the clouds , or on the middle seas !
Parsing [sent. 5487 len. 13]: as the throbbing aether that fills the gulf betwixt star and star !
Parsing [sent. 5488 len. 68]: -- nay , as the thought of the Son of Man himself , who , to make all things new and clean , stood up against the old battery of sin-sprung suffering , withstanding and enduring and stilling the recoil of the awful force wherewith his Father had launched the worlds , and given birth to human souls with wills that might become free as his own !
Parsing [sent. 5489 len. 92]: While Wingfold had been speaking in general terms , with the race in his mind 's , and the congregation in his body 's eye , he had yet thought more of one soul , with its one crime and its intolerable burden , than all the rest : Leopold was ever present to him , and while he strove to avoid absorption in a personal interest however justifiable , it was of necessity that the thought of the most burdened sinner he knew should colour the whole of his utterance .
Parsing [sent. 5490 len. 54]: At times indeed he felt as if he were speaking to him immediately -- and to him only ; at others , although then he saw her no more than him , that he was comforting the sister individually , in holding out to her brother the mighty hope of a restored purity .
Parsing [sent. 5491 len. 30]: And when once more his mind could receive the messages brought home by his eyes , he saw upon Helen 's face the red sunset of a rapt listening .
Parsing [sent. 5492 len. 46]: True it was already fading away , but the eyes had wept , the glow yet hung about cheek and forehead , and the firm mouth had forgotten itself into a tremulous form , which the stillness of absorption had there for the moment fixed .
Parsing [sent. 5493 len. 55]: But even already , although he could not yet read it upon her countenance , a snake had begun to lift its head from the chaotic swamp which runs a creek at least into every soul , the rudimentary desolation , a remnant of the time when the world was without form and void .
Parsing [sent. 5494 len. 20]: And the snake said : `` Why , then , did he not speak like that to my Leopold ?
Parsing [sent. 5495 len. 20]: Why did he not comfort him with such a good hope , well-becoming a priest of the gentle Jesus ?
Parsing [sent. 5496 len. 55]: Or , if he fancied he must speak of confession , why did he not speak of it in plain honest terms , instead of suggesting the idea of it so that the poor boy imagined it came from his own spirit , and must therefore be obeyed as the will of God ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5497 len. 37]: So said the snake , and by the time Helen had walked home with her aunt , the glow had sunk from her soul , and a gray wintry mist had settled down upon her spirit .
Parsing [sent. 5498 len. 111]: And she said to herself that if this last hope in George should fail her , she would not allow the matter to trouble her any farther ; she was a free woman , and as Leopold had chosen other counsellors , had thus declared her unworthy of confidence , and , after all that she had suffered and done for love of him , had turned away from her , she would put money in her purse , set out for France or Italy , and leave him to the fate , whatever it might be , which his new advisers and his own obstinacy might bring upon him .
Parsing [sent. 5499 len. 12]: Was the innocent bound to share the shame of the guilty ?
Parsing [sent. 5500 len. 6]: Had she not done enough ?
Parsing [sent. 5501 len. 16]: Would even her father require more of her than she had already done and endured ?
Parsing [sent. 5502 len. 112]: When , therefore , she went into Leopold 's room , and his eyes sought her from the couch , she took no notice that he had got up and dressed while she was at church ; and he knew that a cloud had come between them , and that after all she had borne and done for him , he and his sister were now farther apart , for the time at least , than when oceans lay betwixt their birth and their meeting ; and he found himself looking back with vague longing even to the terrible old house of Glaston , and the sharing of their agony therein .
Parsing [sent. 5503 len. 25]: His eyes followed her as she walked across to the dressing-room , and the tears rose and filled them , but he said nothing .
Parsing [sent. 5504 len. 113]: And the sister who , all the time of the sermon , had been filled with wave upon wave of wishing -- that Poldie could hear this , could hear that , could have such a thought to comfort him , such a lovely word to drive the horror from his soul , now cast on him a chilly glance , and said never a word of the things to which she had listened with such heavings of the spirit-ocean ; for she felt , with an instinct more righteous than her will , that they would but strengthen him in his determination to do whatever the teacher of them might approve .
Parsing [sent. 5505 len. 34]: As she repassed him to go to the drawing-room , she did indeed say a word of kindness ; but it was in a forced tone , and was only about his dinner !
Parsing [sent. 5506 len. 25]: His eyes over-flowed , but he shut his lips so tight that his mouth grew grim with determination , and no more tears came .
Parsing [sent. 5507 len. 112]: To the friend who joined her at the church-door , and , in George Bascombe 's absence , walked with them along Pine Street , Mrs. Ramshorn remarked that the curate was certainly a most dangerous man -- particularly for young people to hear -- he so confounded all the landmarks of right and wrong , representing the honest man as no better than the thief , and the murderer as no worse than anybody else -- teaching people in fact that the best thing they could do was to commit some terrible crime , in order thereby to attain to a better innocence than without it could ever be theirs .
Parsing [sent. 5508 len. 24]: How far she mistook , or how far she knew or suspected that she spoke falsely , I will not pretend to know .
Parsing [sent. 5509 len. 41]: But although she spoke as she did , there was something , either in the curate or in the sermon , that had quieted her a little , and she was less contemptuous in her condemnation of him than usual .
Parsing [sent. 5510 len. 75]: Happily both for himself and others , the curate was not one of those who cripple the truth and blind their own souls by some craven scruple Of thinking too precisely on the event -- A thought which , quartered , hath but one part wisdom , And ever three parts coward ; and hence , in proportion as he roused the honest , he gave occasion to the dishonest to cavil and condemn .
Parsing [sent. 5511 len. 17]: Imagine St. Paul having a prevision of how he would be misunderstood , AND HEEDING IT !
Parsing [sent. 5512 len. 14]: -- what would then have become of all those his most magnificent outbursts ?
Parsing [sent. 5513 len. 11]: And would any amount of apostolic carefulness have protected him ?
Parsing [sent. 5514 len. 16]: I suspect it would only have given rise to more vulgar misunderstandings and misrepresentations still .
Parsing [sent. 5515 len. 20]: To explain to him who loves not , is but to give him the more plentiful material for misinterpretation .
Parsing [sent. 5516 len. 23]: Let a man have truth in the inward parts , and out of the abundance of his heart let his mouth speak .
Parsing [sent. 5517 len. 51]: If then he should have ground to fear honest misunderstanding , let him preach again to enforce the truth for which he is jealous , and if it should seem to any that the two utterances need reconciling , let those who would have them consistent reconcile them for themselves .
Parsing [sent. 5518 len. 43]: The reason of George Bascombe 's absence from church that morning was , that , after an early breakfast , he had mounted Helen 's mare , and set out to call on Mr. Hooker before he should have gone to church .
Parsing [sent. 5519 len. 14]: Helen expected him back to dinner , and was anxiously looking for him .
Parsing [sent. 5520 len. 14]: So also was Leopold , but the hopes of the two were different .
Parsing [sent. 5521 len. 18]: At length the mare 's hoofs echoed through all Sunday Glaston , and presently George rode up .
Parsing [sent. 5522 len. 16]: The groom took his horse in the street , and he came into the drawing-room .
Parsing [sent. 5523 len. 6]: Helen hastened to meet him .
Parsing [sent. 5524 len. 6]: `` Well , George ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5525 len. 5]: she said , anxiously .
Parsing [sent. 5526 len. 8]: `` Oh , it 's all right !
Parsing [sent. 5527 len. 10]: -- will be at least , I am sure .
Parsing [sent. 5528 len. 13]: I will tell you all about it in the garden after dinner .
Parsing [sent. 5529 len. 16]: -- Aunt has the good sense never to interrupt us there , '' he added .
Parsing [sent. 5530 len. 26]: `` I 'll just run and show myself to Leopold : he must not suspect that I am of your party and playing him false .
Parsing [sent. 5531 len. 9]: Not that it is false , you know !
Parsing [sent. 5532 len. 20]: for two negatives make a positive , and to fool a mad-man is to give him fair play . ''
Parsing [sent. 5533 len. 9]: The words jarred sorely on Helen 's ear .
Parsing [sent. 5534 len. 43]: Bascombe hurried to Leopold , and informed him that he had seen Mr. Hooker , and that all was arranged for taking him over to his place on Tuesday morning , if by that time he should be able for the journey .
Parsing [sent. 5535 len. 6]: `` Why not to-morrow ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5536 len. 3]: said Leopold .
Parsing [sent. 5537 len. 7]: `` I am quite able . ''
Parsing [sent. 5538 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 5539 len. 9]: I told him you were not very strong .
Parsing [sent. 5540 len. 10]: And he wanted a run after the hounds to-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 5541 len. 11]: So we judged it better put off till Tuesday . ''
Parsing [sent. 5542 len. 10]: Leopold gave a sigh , and said no more .
Parsing [sent. 5543 len. 3]: CHAPTER II .
Parsing [sent. 5544 len. 5]: BASCOMBE AND THE MAGISTRATE .
Parsing [sent. 5545 len. 26]: After dinner , the cousins went to the summer-house , and there George gave Helen his report , revealing his plan and hope for Leopold .
Parsing [sent. 5546 len. 12]: `` Such fancies must be humoured , you know , Helen .
Parsing [sent. 5547 len. 14]: There is nothing to be gained by opposing them , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 5548 len. 14]: Helen looked at him with keen eyes , and he returned the gaze .
Parsing [sent. 5549 len. 26]: The confidence betwixt them was not perfect : each was doubtful as to the thought of the other , and neither asked what it was .
Parsing [sent. 5550 len. 10]: `` A fine old cock is Mr. Hooker ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5551 len. 54]: said Greorge ; `` a jolly , good-natured , brick-faced squire ; a tory of course , and a sound church-man ; as simple as a baby , and took everything I told him without a hint of doubt or objection ; -- just the sort of man I expected to find him !
Parsing [sent. 5552 len. 25]: When I mentioned my name , & c. , he found he had known my father , and that gave me a good start .
Parsing [sent. 5553 len. 52]: Then I lauded his avenue , and apologized for troubling him so early and on Sunday too , but said it was a pure work of mercy in which I begged his assistance -- as a magistrate , I added , lest he should fancy I had come after a subscription .
Parsing [sent. 5554 len. 36]: It was a very delicate case , I said , in which were concerned the children of a man of whom he had , I believed , at one time known something -- General Lingard .
Parsing [sent. 5555 len. 6]: ` To be sure ! '
Parsing [sent. 5556 len. 24]: he cried ; ` knew him very well ; a fine fellow -- but hasty , sir -- hasty in his temper ! '
Parsing [sent. 5557 len. 44]: I said I had never known him myself , but one of his children was my cousin ; the other was the child of his second wife , a Hindoo lady unfortunately , and it was about him I presumed to trouble him .
Parsing [sent. 5558 len. 89]: Then I plunged into the matter at once , telling him that Leopold had had violent brain-fever , brought on by a horrible drug , the use of which , if use I dare call it , he had learnt in India ; and that , although he had recovered from the fever , it was very doubtful if ever he would recover from the consequences of it , for that he had become the prey of a fixed idea , the hard deposit from a heated imagination .
Parsing [sent. 5559 len. 8]: ` And pray what is the idea ?
Parsing [sent. 5560 len. 4]: ` he asked .
Parsing [sent. 5561 len. 19]: ` Neither more nor less , ' I answered , ` than that he is a murderer ! '
Parsing [sent. 5562 len. 7]: -- ` God bless me ! '
Parsing [sent. 5563 len. 38]: he cried , somewhat to my alarm , for I had been making all this preamble to prejudice the old gentleman in the right direction , lest afterwards Leopold 's plausibility might be too much for him .
Parsing [sent. 5564 len. 80]: So I echoed the spirit of his exclamation , declaring it was one of the saddest things I had ever known , that a fellow of such sweet and gentle nature , one utterly incapable of unkindness , not to say violence , should be so possessed by misery and remorse for a phantom-deed , no more his than if he had dreamed it , a thing he not only did not do , but never could have done .
Parsing [sent. 5565 len. 98]: I had not yet however told him , I said , what was perhaps the saddest point in the whole sad story -- namely , that the attack had been brought on by the news of the actual murder of a lady to whom he had been passionately attached ; the horror of it had unhinged his reason , then turned and fastened upon his imagination ; so that he was now convinced beyond the reach of argument or even the clearest proof , that it was his own hand that drove the knife to her heart .
Parsing [sent. 5566 len. 56]: Then I recalled to his memory the case as reported , adding that the fact of the murderer 's prolonged evasion of justice , appeared , by some curious legerdemain of his excited fancy , if not to have suggested -- of that I was doubtful -- yet to have ripened his conviction of guilt .
Parsing [sent. 5567 len. 26]: Now nothing would serve him but he must give himself up , confess -- no , that was not a true word in his case !
Parsing [sent. 5568 len. 49]: -- accuse himself of the crime , and meet his fate on the gallows , -- ` in the hope , observe , my dear sir , ' I said , ` of finding her in the other world , and there making it up with her ! '
Parsing [sent. 5569 len. 7]: -- ` God bless me ! '
Parsing [sent. 5570 len. 11]: he cried again , in a tone of absolute horror .
Parsing [sent. 5571 len. 32]: And every now and then , while I spoke , he would ejaculate something ; and still as he listened his eyes grew more and more bloodshot with interest and compassion .
Parsing [sent. 5572 len. 7]: ` Ah , I see ! '
Parsing [sent. 5573 len. 14]: he said then ; ` you want to send him to a madhouse ?
Parsing [sent. 5574 len. 19]: -- Do n't do it , ' he continued , in a tone of expostulation , almost entreaty .
Parsing [sent. 5575 len. 4]: ` Poor boy !
Parsing [sent. 5576 len. 6]: He may get over it .
Parsing [sent. 5577 len. 7]: Let his friends look to him .
Parsing [sent. 5578 len. 9]: He has a sister , you say ? '
Parsing [sent. 5579 len. 57]: I quickly reassured him , telling him such was no one 's desire , and saying I would come to the point in a moment , only there was one thing more which had interested me greatly , as revealing how a brain in such a condition will befool itself , all but generating two individualities .
Parsing [sent. 5580 len. 26]: -- There I am afraid I put my foot in it , but he was far too simple to see it was cloven -- ha !
Parsing [sent. 5581 len. 2]: ha !
Parsing [sent. 5582 len. 21]: and I hastened to remark that , as a magistrate , he must have numberless opportunities of noting similar phenomena .
Parsing [sent. 5583 len. 77]: He waved his hand in deprecation , and I hastened to remark that , up to a certain point , whatever hint the newspapers had given , Leopold had expanded and connected with every other , but that at one part of the story I had found him entirely at fault : he could not tell what he did , where he went , or how he had felt , first after the deed was done .
Parsing [sent. 5584 len. 15]: He confessed all after that was a blank until he found himself in bed .
Parsing [sent. 5585 len. 85]: But when I told him something he had not seen -- which his worship might remember -- the testimony namely of the coast-guardsmen -- about the fishing-boat with the two men in it -- I had here to refresh his memory as to the whole of that circumstance -- and did so by handing him the newspaper containing it -- that was what I made you give me the paper for -- I have lost the thread of my sentence , but never mind .
Parsing [sent. 5586 len. 44]: I told him then something I have not told you yet , Helen , namely , that when I happened to allude to that portion of the story , Leopold started up with flashing eyes , and exclaimed , ` Now I remember !
Parsing [sent. 5587 len. 11]: It all comes back to me as clear as day .
Parsing [sent. 5588 len. 18]: I remember running down the hill , and jumping into the boat just as they shoved off .
Parsing [sent. 5589 len. 11]: I was exhausted , and fell down in the stern .
Parsing [sent. 5590 len. 20]: When I came to myself , the two men were forward : I saw their legs beneath the sails .
Parsing [sent. 5591 len. 18]: I thought they would be sure to give me up , and at once I slipped overboard .
Parsing [sent. 5592 len. 27]: The water revived me , but when I reached the shore , I fell down again , and lay there I do n't know how long .
Parsing [sent. 5593 len. 12]: Indeed I do n't remember anything more except very confusedly . '
Parsing [sent. 5594 len. 14]: That is what Leopold said , and what I now told Mr. Hooker .
Parsing [sent. 5595 len. 48]: Then at last I opened my mind to him as to wherein I ventured to ask his assistance ; and my petition was , that he would allow me to bring Leopold , and would let him go through the form of giving himself up to justice .
Parsing [sent. 5596 len. 24]: Especially I begged that he would listen to all he had to say , and give no sign that he doubted his story .
Parsing [sent. 5597 len. 35]: ` And then , sir , ' I concluded , ' I would leave it to you to do what we can not -- reconcile him to going home instead of to prison . '
Parsing [sent. 5598 len. 22]: `` He sat with his head on his hand for a while , as if pondering some weighty question of law .
Parsing [sent. 5599 len. 12]: Then he said suddenly : ` It is now almost church-time .
Parsing [sent. 5600 len. 7]: I will think the matter over .
Parsing [sent. 5601 len. 6]: You may rely upon me .
Parsing [sent. 5602 len. 15]: Will you take a seat in my pew and dine with us after ? '
Parsing [sent. 5603 len. 23]: I excused myself on the ground that I must return at once to poor Leopold , who was anxiously looking for me .
Parsing [sent. 5604 len. 28]: And you must forgive me , Helen , and not fancy me misusing Fanny , if I did yield to the temptation of a little longer ride .
Parsing [sent. 5605 len. 26]: I have scarcely more than walked her , with a canter now and then when we had the chance of a bit of turf . ''
Parsing [sent. 5606 len. 47]: Helen assured him with grateful eyes that she knew Fanny was as safe with him as with herself ; and she felt such a gush of gratitude follow the revival of hope , that she was nearer being in love with her cousin to ever before .
Parsing [sent. 5607 len. 40]: Her gratitude inwardly delighted George , and he thought the light in her blue eyes lovelier than ever ; but although strougly tempted , he judged it better to delay a formal confession until circumstances should be more comfortable .
Parsing [sent. 5608 len. 3]: CHAPTER III .
Parsing [sent. 5609 len. 3]: THE CONFESSION .
Parsing [sent. 5610 len. 14]: All that and the following day Leopold was in spirits for him wonderful .
Parsing [sent. 5611 len. 18]: On Monday night there came a considerable reaction ; he was dejected , worn , and weary .
Parsing [sent. 5612 len. 43]: Twelve o'clock the next day was the hour appointed for their visit to Mr. Hooker , and at eleven he was dressed and ready -- restless , agitated , and very pale , but not a whit less determined than at first .
Parsing [sent. 5613 len. 12]: A drive was the pretext for borrowing Mrs. Ramshorn 's carriage .
Parsing [sent. 5614 len. 9]: `` Why is Mr. Wingfold not coming ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5615 len. 11]: asked Lingard , anxiously , when it began to move .
Parsing [sent. 5616 len. 18]: `` I fancy we shall be quite as comfortable without him , Poldie , '' said Helen .
Parsing [sent. 5617 len. 7]: `` Did you expect him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5618 len. 8]: `` He promised to go with me .
Parsing [sent. 5619 len. 12]: But he has n't called since the time was fixed . ''
Parsing [sent. 5620 len. 9]: -- Here Helen looked out of the window .
Parsing [sent. 5621 len. 10]: -- `` I ca n't think why it is .
Parsing [sent. 5622 len. 22]: I can do my duty without him though , '' continued Leopold , `` and perhaps it is just as well .
Parsing [sent. 5623 len. 34]: -- Do you know , George , since I made up my mind , I have seen her but once , and that was last night , and only in a dream . ''
Parsing [sent. 5624 len. 33]: `` A state of irresolution is one peculiarly open to unhealthy impressions , '' said George , good-naturedly disposing of his long legs so that they should be out of the way .
Parsing [sent. 5625 len. 8]: Leopold turned from him to his sister .
Parsing [sent. 5626 len. 31]: `` The strange thing , Helen , '' he said , `` was that I did not feel the least afraid of her , or even abashed before her . '
Parsing [sent. 5627 len. 8]: I see you , ' I said .
Parsing [sent. 5628 len. 5]: ` Be at peace .
Parsing [sent. 5629 len. 15]: I am coming ; and you shall do to me what you will . '
Parsing [sent. 5630 len. 8]: And then -- what do you think ?
Parsing [sent. 5631 len. 5]: -- O my God !
Parsing [sent. 5632 len. 19]: she smiled one of her own old smiles , only sad too , very sad , and vanished .
Parsing [sent. 5633 len. 23]: I woke , and she seemed only to have just left the room , for there was a stir in the darkness .
Parsing [sent. 5634 len. 10]: -- Do you believe in ghosts , George ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5635 len. 14]: Leopold was not one of George 's initiated , I need hardly say .
Parsing [sent. 5636 len. 7]: `` No , '' answered Bascombe .
Parsing [sent. 5637 len. 6]: `` I do n't wonder .
Parsing [sent. 5638 len. 12]: I ca n't blame you , for neither did I once .
Parsing [sent. 5639 len. 12]: But just wait till you have made one , George ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5640 len. 5]: `` God forbid ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5641 len. 9]: exclaimed Bascombe , a second time forgetting himself .
Parsing [sent. 5642 len. 4]: `` Amen ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5643 len. 20]: said Leopold : `` for after that there 's no help but be one yourself , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 5644 len. 13]: `` If he would only talk like that to old Hooker ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5645 len. 3]: thought George .
Parsing [sent. 5646 len. 17]: `` It would go a long way to forestall any possible misconception of the case . ''
Parsing [sent. 5647 len. 17]: `` I ca n't think why Mr. Wingfold did not come yesterday , '' resumed Leopold .
Parsing [sent. 5648 len. 8]: `` I made sure he would . ''
Parsing [sent. 5649 len. 29]: `` Now , Poldie , you must n't talk , '' said Helen , `` or you 'll be exhausted before we get to Mr. Hooker 's . ''
Parsing [sent. 5650 len. 18]: `` She did not wish the non-appearance of the curate on Monday to be closely inquired into .
Parsing [sent. 5651 len. 15]: His company at the magistrate 's was by all possible means to be avoided .
Parsing [sent. 5652 len. 37]: George had easily persuaded Helen , more easily than he expected , to wait their return in the carriage , and the two men were shown into the library , where the magistrate presently joined them .
Parsing [sent. 5653 len. 19]: He would have shaken hands with Leopold as well as George , but the conscious felon drew back .
Parsing [sent. 5654 len. 12]: `` No , sir ; excuse me , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 5655 len. 28]: `` Hear what I have to tell you first ; and if after that you will shake hands with me , it will be a kindness indeed .
Parsing [sent. 5656 len. 5]: But you will not !
Parsing [sent. 5657 len. 5]: you will not ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5658 len. 41]: Worthy Mr. Hooker was overwhelmed with pity at sight of the worn sallow face with the great eyes , in which he found every appearance confirmatory of the tale wherewith Bascombe had filled and prejudiced every fibre of his judgment .
Parsing [sent. 5659 len. 20]: He listened in the kindest way while the poor boy forced the words of his confession from his throat .
Parsing [sent. 5660 len. 25]: But Leopold never dreamed of attributing his emotion to any other cause than compassion for one who had been betrayed into such a crime .
Parsing [sent. 5661 len. 32]: It was against his will , for he seemed now bent , even to unreason , on fighting every weakness , that he was prevailed upon to take a little wine .
Parsing [sent. 5662 len. 24]: Having ended , he sat silent , in the posture of one whose wrists are already clasped by the double bracelet of steel .
Parsing [sent. 5663 len. 52]: Now Mr. Hooker had thought the thing out in church on the Sunday ; and after a hard run at the tail of a strong fox over a rough country on the Monday , and a good sleep well into the morning of the Tuesday , could see no better way .
Parsing [sent. 5664 len. 6]: His device was simple enough .
Parsing [sent. 5665 len. 26]: `` My dear young gentleman , '' he said , `` I am very sorry for you , but I must do my duty . ''
Parsing [sent. 5666 len. 19]: `` That , sir , is what I came to you for , '' answered Leopold , humbly .
Parsing [sent. 5667 len. 9]: `` Then you must consider yourself my prisoner .
Parsing [sent. 5668 len. 24]: The moment you , are gone , I shall make notes of your deposition , and proceed to arrange for the necessary formalities .
Parsing [sent. 5669 len. 24]: As a mere matter of form , I shall take your own bail in a thousand pounds to surrender when called upon . ''
Parsing [sent. 5670 len. 20]: `` But I am not of age , and have n't got a thousand pounds , '' said Leopold .
Parsing [sent. 5671 len. 13]: `` Perhaps Mr. Hooker will accept my recognizance in the amount ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5672 len. 3]: said Bascombe .
Parsing [sent. 5673 len. 16]: `` Certainly , '' answered Mr. Hooker , and wrote something , which Bascombe signed .
Parsing [sent. 5674 len. 12]: `` You are very good , George , '' said Leopold .
Parsing [sent. 5675 len. 24]: `` But you know I ca n't run away if I would , '' he added with a pitiful attempt at a smile .
Parsing [sent. 5676 len. 15]: `` I hope you will soon be better , '' said the magistrate kindly .
Parsing [sent. 5677 len. 9]: `` Why such a wish , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5678 len. 15]: returned Leopold , almost reproachfully , and the good man stood abashed before him .
Parsing [sent. 5679 len. 15]: He thought of it afterwards , and was puzzled to know how it was .
Parsing [sent. 5680 len. 27]: `` You must hold yourself in readiness , '' he said , recovering himself with an effort , `` to give yourself up at any moment .
Parsing [sent. 5681 len. 28]: And , rememher , I shall call upon you when I please , every week , perhaps , or oftener , to see that you are safe .
Parsing [sent. 5682 len. 18]: Your aunt is an old friend of mine , and there will be no need of explanations .
Parsing [sent. 5683 len. 26]: This turns out to be no common case , and after hearing the whole , I do not hesitate to offer you my hand . ''
Parsing [sent. 5684 len. 15]: Leopold was overcome by his kindness , and withdrew speechless , but greatly relieved .
Parsing [sent. 5685 len. 60]: Several times during the course of his narrative , its apparent truthfulness and its circumstantiality went nigh to stagger Mr. Hooker ; but a glance at Bascombe 's face , with its half-amused smile , instantly set him right again , and he thought with dismay how near he had been to letting himself be fooled by a madman .
Parsing [sent. 5686 len. 33]: Again in the carriage , Leopold laid his head on Helen 's shoulder , and looked up in her face with such a smile as she had never seen on his before .
Parsing [sent. 5687 len. 28]: Certainly there was something in confession -- if only enthusiasts like Mr. Wingfold would not spoil all by pushing things to extremes and turning good into bad !
Parsing [sent. 5688 len. 63]: Leopold was yet such a child , had so little occupied himself with things about him , and had been so entirely taken up with his passion , and the poetry of existence unlawfully forced , that if his knowledge of the circumstances of Emmeline 's murder had depended on the newspapers , he would have remained in utter ignorance concerning them .
Parsing [sent. 5689 len. 33]: From the same causes he was so entirely unacquainted with the modes of criminal procedure , that the conduct of the magistrate never struck him as strange , not to say illegal .
Parsing [sent. 5690 len. 31]: And so strongly did he feel the good man 's kindness and sympathy , that his comfort from making a clean breast of it was even greater than he expected .
Parsing [sent. 5691 len. 9]: Before they reached home he was fast asleep .
Parsing [sent. 5692 len. 21]: When laid on his couch , he almost fell asleep again , and Helen saw him smile as he slept .
Parsing [sent. 5693 len. 3]: CHAPTER IV .
Parsing [sent. 5694 len. 3]: THE MASK .
Parsing [sent. 5695 len. 42]: But although such was George Bascombe 's judgment of Leopold , and such his conduct of his affair , he could not prevent the recurrent intrusion of the flickering doubt which had showed itself when first he listened to the story .
Parsing [sent. 5696 len. 55]: Amid all the wildness of the tale there was yet a certain air , not merely of truthfulness in the narrator -- that was not to be questioned -- but of verisimilitude in the narration , which had its effect , although it gave rise to no conscious exercise of discriminating or ponderating faculty .
Parsing [sent. 5697 len. 63]: Leopold 's air of conviction also , although of course that might well accompany the merest invention rooted in madness , yet had its force , persistently as George pooh-poohed it -- which he did the more strenuously from the intense , even morbid abhorrence of his nature to being taken in , and having to confess himself of unstable intellectual equilibrium .
Parsing [sent. 5698 len. 31]: Possibly this was not the only kind of thing in which the sensitiveness of a vanity he would himself have disowned , had rendered him unfit for perceiving the truth .
Parsing [sent. 5699 len. 31]: Nor do I know how much there may be to choose between the two shames -- that of accepting what is untrue , and that of refusing what is true .
Parsing [sent. 5700 len. 42]: The second time he listened to Leopold 's continuous narrative , the doubt returned with more clearness and less flicker : there was such a thing as being over-wise : might he not be taking himself in with his own incredulity ?
Parsing [sent. 5701 len. 8]: Ought he not to apply some test ?
Parsing [sent. 5702 len. 12]: And did Leopold 's story offer any means of doing so ?
Parsing [sent. 5703 len. 54]: -- One thing , he then found , had been dimly haunting his thoughts ever since he heard it : Leopold affirmed that he had thrown his cloak and mask down an old pit-shaft , close by the place of murder : if there was such a shaft , could it be searched ?
Parsing [sent. 5704 len. 39]: -- Recurring doubt at length so wrought upon his mind , that he resolved to make his holiday excursion to that neighbourhood , and there endeavour to gain what assurance of any sort might be to be had .
Parsing [sent. 5705 len. 18]: What end beyond his own possible satisfaction the inquiry was to answer he did not ask himself .
Parsing [sent. 5706 len. 48]: The restless spirit of the detective , so often conjoined with indifference to what is in its own nature true , was at work in him -- but that was not all : he must know the very facts , if possible , of whatever concerned Helen .
Parsing [sent. 5707 len. 21]: I shall not follow his proceedings closely : it is with their reaction upon Leopold that I have to do .
Parsing [sent. 5708 len. 17]: The house where the terrible thing took place was not far from a little moorland village .
Parsing [sent. 5709 len. 24]: There Bascombe found a small inn , where he took up his quarters , pretending to be a geologist out for a holiday .
Parsing [sent. 5710 len. 8]: He soon came upon the disused shaft .
Parsing [sent. 5711 len. 62]: The inn was a good deal frequented in the evenings by the colliers of the district -- a rough race , but not beyond the influences of such an address , mingled of self-assertion and good fellowship , as Bascombe brought to bear upon them , for he had soon perceived that amongst them he might find the assistance he wanted .
Parsing [sent. 5712 len. 24]: In the course of conversation , therefore , he mentioned the shaft , on which he pretended to have come in his rambles .
Parsing [sent. 5713 len. 26]: Remarking on the danger of such places , he learned that this one served for ventilation , and was still accessible below from other workings .
Parsing [sent. 5714 len. 69]: Thereafter he begged permission to go down one of the pits , on pretext of examining the coal-strata , and having secured for his guide one of the most intelligent of those whose acquaintance he had made at the inn , persuaded him , partly by expressions of incredulity because of the distance between , to guide him to the bottom of the shaft whose accessibility he maintained .
Parsing [sent. 5715 len. 34]: That they were going in the right direction , he had the testimony of the little compass he carried at his watch-chain , and at length he saw a faint gleam before him .
Parsing [sent. 5716 len. 37]: When at last he raised his head , wearily bent beneath the low roofs of the passages , and looked upwards , there was a star looking down at him out of the sky of day !
Parsing [sent. 5717 len. 30]: But George never wasted time in staring at what was above his head , and so began instantly to search about as if examining the indications of the strata .
Parsing [sent. 5718 len. 4]: Was it possible ?
Parsing [sent. 5719 len. 4]: Could it be ?
Parsing [sent. 5720 len. 16]: There was a piece of black something that was not coal , and seemed textile !
Parsing [sent. 5721 len. 13]: It was a half-mask , for there were the eye-holes in it !
Parsing [sent. 5722 len. 23]: He caught it up and hurried it into his bag -- not so quickly but that the haste set his guide speculating .
Parsing [sent. 5723 len. 9]: And Bascombe saw that the action was noted .
Parsing [sent. 5724 len. 16]: The man afterwards offered to carry his bag , but he would not allow him .
Parsing [sent. 5725 len. 23]: The next morning he left the place and returned to London , taking Glaston , by a detour , on his way .
Parsing [sent. 5726 len. 45]: A few questions to Leopold drew from him a description of the mask he had worn , entirely corresponding with the one George had found ; and at length he was satisfied that there was truth more than a little in Leopold 's confession .
Parsing [sent. 5727 len. 19]: It was not his business , however , he now said to himself , to set magistrates right .
Parsing [sent. 5728 len. 34]: True , he had set Mr. Hooker wrong in the first place , but he had done it in good faith , and how could he turn traitor to Helen and her brother ?
Parsing [sent. 5729 len. 20]: Besides , he was sure the magistrate himself would be anything but obliged to him for opening his eyes !
Parsing [sent. 5730 len. 27]: At the same time Leopold 's fanatic eagerness after confession might drive the matter further , and if so , it might become awkward for him .
Parsing [sent. 5731 len. 100]: He might be looked to for the defence , and were he not certain that his guide had marked his concealment of what he had picked up , he might have ventured to undertake it , for certainly it would have been a rare chance for a display of the forensic talent he believed himself to possess ; but as it was , the moment he was called to the bar -- which would be within a fortnight -- he would go abroad , say to Paris , and there , for twelve months or so , await events .
Parsing [sent. 5732 len. 33]: When he disclosed to Helen his evil success in the coalpit , it was but the merest film of a hope it destroyed , for she KNEW that her brother was guilty .
Parsing [sent. 5733 len. 18]: George and she now felt that they were linked by the possession of a common , secret .
Parsing [sent. 5734 len. 21]: But the cloak had been found a short time before , and was in the possession of Emmeline 's mother .
Parsing [sent. 5735 len. 12]: That mother was a woman of strong passions and determined character .
Parsing [sent. 5736 len. 39]: The first shock of the catastrophe over , her grief was almost supplanted by a rage for vengeance , in the compassing of which no doubt she vaguely imagined she would be doing something to right her daughter .
Parsing [sent. 5737 len. 29]: Hence the protracted concealment of the murderer was bitterness to her soul , and she vowed herself to discovery and revenge as the one business of her life .
Parsing [sent. 5738 len. 52]: In this her husband , a good deal broken by the fearful event , but still more by misfortunes of another kind which had begun to threaten him , offered her no assistance , and indeed felt neither her passion urge him , nor her perseverance hold him to the pursuit .
Parsing [sent. 5739 len. 26]: In the neighbourhood her mind was well known , and not a few found their advantage in supplying her passion with the fuel of hope .
Parsing [sent. 5740 len. 68]: Any hint of evidence , however small , the remotest suggestion even towards discovery , they would carry at once to her , for she was an open-handed woman , and in such case would give with a profusion that , but for the feeling concerned , would have been absurd , and did expose her to the greed of every lying mendicant within reach of her .
Parsing [sent. 5741 len. 59]: Not unnaturally , therefore , it had occurred to a certain collier to make his way to the bottom of the shaft , on the chance -- hardly of finding , but of being enabled to invent something worth reporting ; and there , to the very fooling of his barren expectation , he had found the cloak .
Parsing [sent. 5742 len. 41]: The mother had been over to Holland , where she had instituted unavailing inquiries in the villages along the coast and among the islands , and had been home but a few days when the cloak was carried to her .
Parsing [sent. 5743 len. 27]: In her mind it immediately associated itself with the costumes of the horrible ball , and at once she sought the list of her guests thereat .
Parsing [sent. 5744 len. 42]: It was before her at the very moment when the man , who had been Bascombe 's guide , sent in to request an interview , the result of which was to turn her attention for the time in another direction .
Parsing [sent. 5745 len. 11]: -- Who might the visitor to the mine have been ?
Parsing [sent. 5746 len. 35]: Little was to be gathered in the neighbourhood beyond the facts that the letters G. B. were on his carpet-bag , and that a scrap of torn envelope bore what seemed the letters mple .
Parsing [sent. 5747 len. 11]: She despatched the poor indications to an inquiry-office in London .
Parsing [sent. 5748 len. 5]: CHAPTER V. FURTHER DECISION .
Parsing [sent. 5749 len. 17]: The day after his confession to Mr. Hooker , a considerable re-action took place in Lingard .
Parsing [sent. 5750 len. 13]: He did not propose to leave his bed , and lay exhausted .
Parsing [sent. 5751 len. 7]: He said he had caught cold .
Parsing [sent. 5752 len. 28]: He coughed a little ; wondered why Mr. Wingfold did not come to see him , dozed a good deal , and often woke with a start .
Parsing [sent. 5753 len. 42]: Mrs. Ramshorn thought Helen ought to make him get up : nothing , she said , could be worse for him than lying in bed ; but Helen thought , even if her aunt were right , he must be humoured .
Parsing [sent. 5754 len. 21]: The following day Mr. Hooker called , inquired after him , and went up to his room to see him .
Parsing [sent. 5755 len. 144]: There he said all he could think of to make him comfortable ; repeated that certain preliminaries had to be gone through before the commencement of the prosecution ; said that while these went on , it was better he should be in his sister 's care than in prison , where , if he went at once , he most probably would die before the trial came on ; that in the meantime he was responsible for him ; that , although he had done quite right in giving himself up , he must not let what was done and could no more be helped , prey too much upon his mind , lest it should render him unable to give his evidence with proper clearness , and he should be judged insane and sent to Broadmoor , which would be frightful .
Parsing [sent. 5756 len. 37]: He ended by saying that he had had great provocation , and that he was certain the judge would consider it in passing sentence , only he must satisfy the jury there had been no premeditation .
Parsing [sent. 5757 len. 18]: `` I will not utter a word to excuse myself , Mr. Hooker , '' replied Leopold .
Parsing [sent. 5758 len. 22]: The worthy magistrate smiled sadly , and went away , if possible , more convinced of the poor lad 's insanity .
Parsing [sent. 5759 len. 41]: The visit helped Leopold over that day , but when the next also passed , and neither did Wingfold appear , nor any explanation of his absence reach him , he made up his mind to act again for himself .
Parsing [sent. 5760 len. 20]: The cause of the curate 's apparent neglect , though ill to find , was not far to seek .
Parsing [sent. 5761 len. 63]: On the Monday , he had , upon some pretext or other , been turned away ; on the Tuesday , he had been told that Mr. Lingard had gone for a drive ; on the Wednesday , that he was much too tired to be seen ; and thereupon had at length judged it better to leave things to right themselves .
Parsing [sent. 5762 len. 53]: If Leopold did not want to see him , it would be of no use by persistence to force his way to him ; while on the other hand , if he did want to see him , he felt convinced the poor fellow would manage to have his own way somehow .
Parsing [sent. 5763 len. 20]: The next morning after he had thus resolved , Leopold declared himself better , and got up and dressed .
Parsing [sent. 5764 len. 29]: He then lay on the sofa and waited as quietly as he could until Helen went out -- Mr , Faber insisting she should do so every day .
Parsing [sent. 5765 len. 31]: It was no madness , but a burning desire for life , coupled with an utter carelessness of that which is commonly called life , that now ruled his behaviour .
Parsing [sent. 5766 len. 28]: He tied his slippers on his feet , put on his smoking-cap , crept unseen from the house , and took the direction , of the Abbey .
Parsing [sent. 5767 len. 65]: The influence of the air -- by his weakness rendered intoxicating , the strange look of everything around him , the nervous excitement of every human approach , kept him up until he reached the churchyard , across which he was crawling , to find the curate 's lodging , when suddenly his brain seemed to go swimming away into regions beyond the senses .
Parsing [sent. 5768 len. 25]: He attempted to seat himself on a grave-stone , but lost consciousness , and fell at full length between that and the next one .
Parsing [sent. 5769 len. 27]: When Helen returned , she was horrified to find that he had gone -- when , or whither nobody knew : no one had missed him .
Parsing [sent. 5770 len. 28]: Her first fear was the river , but her conscience enlightened her , and her shame could not prevent her from seeking him at the curate 's .
Parsing [sent. 5771 len. 10]: In her haste she passed him where he lay .
Parsing [sent. 5772 len. 21]: Shown into the curate 's study , she gave a hurried glance around , and her anxiety became terror again .
Parsing [sent. 5773 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 5774 len. 13]: Mr. Wingfold , '' she cried , `` where is Leopold ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5775 len. 15]: `` I have not seen him , '' replied the curate , turning pale .
Parsing [sent. 5776 len. 11]: `` Then he has thrown himself in the river ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5777 len. 9]: cried Helen , and sank on a chair .
Parsing [sent. 5778 len. 7]: The curate caught up his hat .
Parsing [sent. 5779 len. 9]: `` You wait here , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 5780 len. 10]: `` I will go and look for him . ''
Parsing [sent. 5781 len. 21]: But Helen rose , and , without another word , they set off together , and again entered the churchyard .
Parsing [sent. 5782 len. 24]: As they hurried across it , the curate caught sight of something on the ground , and , springing forward , found Leopold .
Parsing [sent. 5783 len. 6]: `` He is dead ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5784 len. 15]: cried Helen , in an agony , when she saw him stop and stoop .
Parsing [sent. 5785 len. 27]: He looked dead indeed ; but what appalled her the most reassured Wingfold a little : blood had flowed freely from a cut on his eyebrow .
Parsing [sent. 5786 len. 50]: The curate lifted him , no hard task , out of the damp shadow , and laid him on the stone , which was warm in the sun , with his head on Helen 's lap , then ran to order the carriage , and hastened back with brandy .
Parsing [sent. 5787 len. 15]: They got a little into his mouth , but he could not swallow it .
Parsing [sent. 5788 len. 28]: Still it seemed to do him good , for presently he gave a deep sigh ; and just then they heard the carriage stop at the gate .
Parsing [sent. 5789 len. 43]: Wingfold took him up , carried him to it , got in with him in his arms , and held him on his knees until he reached the manor house , when he carried him upstairs and laid him on the sofa .
Parsing [sent. 5790 len. 18]: When they had brought him round a little , he undressed him and put him to bed .
Parsing [sent. 5791 len. 22]: `` Do not leave me , '' murmured Leopold , just as Helen entered the room , and she heard it .
Parsing [sent. 5792 len. 12]: Wingfold looked to her for the answer he was to make .
Parsing [sent. 5793 len. 13]: Her bearing was much altered : she was both ashamed and humbled .
Parsing [sent. 5794 len. 28]: `` Yes , Leopold , '' she said , `` Mr. Wingfold will , I am sure , stay with you as long as he can . ''
Parsing [sent. 5795 len. 10]: `` Indeed I will , '' assented the curate .
Parsing [sent. 5796 len. 11]: `` But I must run for Mr. Faber first . ''
Parsing [sent. 5797 len. 8]: `` How did I come here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5798 len. 22]: asked Leopold , opening his eyes large upon Helen after swallowing a spoonful of the broth she held to his lips .
Parsing [sent. 5799 len. 23]: But , before she could answer him , he turned sick , and by the time the doctor came was very feverish .
Parsing [sent. 5800 len. 19]: Faber gave the necessary directions , and Wingfold walked back with him to get his prescription made up .
Parsing [sent. 5801 len. 3]: CHAPTER VI .
Parsing [sent. 5802 len. 6]: THE CURATE AND THE DOCTOR .
Parsing [sent. 5803 len. 25]: `` There is something strange about that young man 's illness , '' said Faber , as soon as they had left the house .
Parsing [sent. 5804 len. 27]: `` I fancy you know more than you can tell , and if so , then I have committed no indiscretion in saying as much . ''
Parsing [sent. 5805 len. 21]: `` Perhaps it might be an indiscretion to acknowledge as much however , '' said the curate with a smile .
Parsing [sent. 5806 len. 5]: `` You are right .
Parsing [sent. 5807 len. 23]: I have not been long in the place , '' returned Faber , `` and you had no opportunity of testing me .
Parsing [sent. 5808 len. 21]: But I am indifferent honest as well as you , though I do n't go with you in everything . ''
Parsing [sent. 5809 len. 16]: `` People would have me believe you do n't go with me in anything . ''
Parsing [sent. 5810 len. 10]: `` They say as much -- do they ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5811 len. 6]: returned Faber with some annoyance .
Parsing [sent. 5812 len. 15]: `` I thought I had been careful not to trespass on your preserves . ''
Parsing [sent. 5813 len. 17]: `` As for preserves , I do n't know of any , '' answered the curate .
Parsing [sent. 5814 len. 23]: `` There is no true bird in the grounds that wo n't manage somehow to escape the snare of the fowler . ''
Parsing [sent. 5815 len. 46]: `` Well , '' said the doctor , `` I know nothing about God and all that kind of thing , but , though I do n't think I 'm a coward exactly either , I know I should like to have your pluck . ''
Parsing [sent. 5816 len. 13]: `` I have n't got any pluck , '' said the curate .
Parsing [sent. 5817 len. 11]: `` Tell that to the marines , '' said Faber .
Parsing [sent. 5818 len. 50]: `` I dare n't go and say what I think or do n't think , even in the bedroom of my least orthodox patient -- at least , if I do , I instantly repent it -- while you go on saying what you really believe Sunday after Sunday !
Parsing [sent. 5819 len. 21]: -- How you can believe it , I do n't know , and it 's no business of mine . ''
Parsing [sent. 5820 len. 8]: `` Oh yes , it is ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5821 len. 3]: returned Wingfold .
Parsing [sent. 5822 len. 33]: `` But as to the pluck , it may be a man 's duty to say in the pulpit what he would be just as wrong to say by a sick-bed . ''
Parsing [sent. 5823 len. 10]: `` That has nothing to do with the pluck !
Parsing [sent. 5824 len. 8]: That 's all I care about . ''
Parsing [sent. 5825 len. 13]: `` It has everything to do with what you take for pluck .
Parsing [sent. 5826 len. 8]: My pluck is only Don Worm . ''
Parsing [sent. 5827 len. 12]: `` I do n't know what you mean by that . ''
Parsing [sent. 5828 len. 17]: `` It 's Benedick 's name , in Much Ado about Nothing , for the conscience .
Parsing [sent. 5829 len. 9]: MY pluck is nothing but my conscience . ''
Parsing [sent. 5830 len. 19]: `` It 's a damned fine thing to have anyhow , whatever name you put upon it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5831 len. 3]: said Faber .
Parsing [sent. 5832 len. 19]: `` Excuse me if I find your epithet more amusing than apt , '' said Wingfold , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 5833 len. 10]: `` You are quite right , '' said Faber .
Parsing [sent. 5834 len. 5]: `` I apologize . ''
Parsing [sent. 5835 len. 77]: `` As to the pluck again , '' Wingfold resumed , '' -- if you think of this one fact -- that my whole desire is to believe in God , and that the only thing I can be sure of sometimes is that , if there be a God , none but an honest man will ever find him , you will not then say there is much pluck in my speaking the truth ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5836 len. 53]: `` I do n't see that that makes it a hair easier , in the face of such a set of gaping noodles as -- '' `` I beg your pardon : -- there is more lack of conscience than of brains in the Abbey of a Sunday , I fear . ''
Parsing [sent. 5837 len. 29]: `` Well , all I have to say is , I ca n't for the life of me see what you want to believe in a God for !
Parsing [sent. 5838 len. 15]: It seems to me the world would go rather better without any such fancy .
Parsing [sent. 5839 len. 19]: Look here now : there is young Spenser -- out there at Harwood -- a patient of mine .
Parsing [sent. 5840 len. 15]: His wife died yesterday -- one of the loveliest young creatures you ever saw .
Parsing [sent. 5841 len. 13]: The poor fellow is as bad about it as fellow can be .
Parsing [sent. 5842 len. 45]: Well , he 's one of your sort , and said to me the other day , just as you would have him , ` It 's the will of God , ' he said , ` and we must hold our peace . '
Parsing [sent. 5843 len. 21]: -- ` Do n't talk to me about God , ' I said , for I could n't stand it .
Parsing [sent. 5844 len. 42]: ` Do you mean to tell me that , if there was a God , he would have taken such a lovely creature as that away from her husband and her helpless infant , at the age of two and twenty ?
Parsing [sent. 5845 len. 8]: I scorn to believe it . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 5846 len. 9]: `` What did he say to that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5847 len. 15]: `` He turned as white as death , and said never a word . ''
Parsing [sent. 5848 len. 20]: `` Ah , you forgot that you were taking from him his only hope of seeing her again ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5849 len. 13]: `` I certainly did not think of that , '' said Faber .
Parsing [sent. 5850 len. 74]: `` Even then , '' resumed Wingfold , `` I should not say you were wrong , if you were prepared to add that you had searched every possible region of existence , and had found no God ; or that you had tried every theory man had invented , or even that you were able to invent yourself , and had found none of them consistent with the being of a God .
Parsing [sent. 5851 len. 29]: I do not say that then you would be right in your judgment , for another man , of equal weight , might have had a different experience .
Parsing [sent. 5852 len. 11]: I only say , I would not then blame you .
Parsing [sent. 5853 len. 41]: But you must allow it a very serious thing to assert as a conviction , without such grounds as the assertor has pretty fully satisfied himself concerning , what COULD only drive the sting of death ten times deeper . ''
Parsing [sent. 5854 len. 5]: The doctor was silent .
Parsing [sent. 5855 len. 37]: `` I doubt not you spoke in a burst of indignation ; but it seems to me the indignation of a man unaccustomed to ponder the things concerning which he expresses such a positive conviction . ''
Parsing [sent. 5856 len. 32]: `` You are wrong there , '' returned Faber ; `` for I was brought up in the straitest sect of the Pharisees , and know what I am saying . ''
Parsing [sent. 5857 len. 32]: `` The straitest sect of the Pharisees can hardly be the school in which to gather any such idea of a God as one could wish to be a reality . ''
Parsing [sent. 5858 len. 7]: `` They profess to know . ''
Parsing [sent. 5859 len. 17]: `` Is that any argument of weight , they and their opinions being what they are ?
Parsing [sent. 5860 len. 25]: -- If there be a God , do you imagine he would choose any strait sect under the sun to be his interpreters ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5861 len. 53]: `` But the question is not of the idea of a God , but of the existence of any , seeing , if he exists , he must be such as the human heart could never accept as God , inasmuch as he at least permits , if not himself enacts cruelty .
Parsing [sent. 5862 len. 18]: My argument to poor Spenser remains -- however unwise or indeed cruel it may have been . ''
Parsing [sent. 5863 len. 57]: `` I grant it a certain amount of force -- as much exactly as had gone to satisfy the children whom I heard the other day agreeing that Dr. Faber was a very cruel man , for he pulled out nurse 's tooth , and gave poor little baby such a nasty , nasty powder ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5864 len. 7]: `` Is that a fair parallel ?
Parsing [sent. 5865 len. 7]: I must look at it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5866 len. 6]: `` I think it is .
Parsing [sent. 5867 len. 34]: What you do is often unpleasant , sometimes most painful , but it does not follow that you are a cruel man , and a hurter instead of a healer of men . ''
Parsing [sent. 5868 len. 15]: `` I think there is a fault in the analogy , '' said Faber .
Parsing [sent. 5869 len. 22]: `` For here am I nothing but a slave to laws already existing , and compelled to work according to them .
Parsing [sent. 5870 len. 16]: It is not my fault therefore that the remedies I have to use are unpleasant .
Parsing [sent. 5871 len. 17]: But if there be a God , he has the matter in his own hands . ''
Parsing [sent. 5872 len. 22]: `` There is weight and justice in your argument , which may well make the analogy appear at first sight false .
Parsing [sent. 5873 len. 13]: But is there no theory possible that should make it perfect ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5874 len. 11]: `` I do not see how there should be any .
Parsing [sent. 5875 len. 34]: For , if you say God is under any such compulsion as I am under , then surely the house is divided against itself , and God is not God any more . ''
Parsing [sent. 5876 len. 41]: `` For my part , '' said the curate , `` I think I COULD believe in a God who did but his imperfect best : in one all power , and not all goodness , I could not believe .
Parsing [sent. 5877 len. 295]: But suppose that the design of God involved the perfecting of men as the CHILDREN OF GOD -- ' I said ye are gods , ' -- that he would have them partakers of his own blessedness in kind -- be as himself ; -- suppose his grand idea could not be contented with creatures perfect ONLY by his gift , so far as that should reach , and having no willing causal share in the perfection , that is , partaking not at all of God 's individuality and free-will and choice of good ; then suppose that suffering were the only way through which the individual could be set , in separate and self-individuality , so far apart from God , that it might WILL , and so become a partaker of his singleness and freedom ; -- and suppose that this suffering must be and had been initiated by God 's taking his share , and that the infinitely greater share ; -- suppose next , that God saw the germ of a pure affection , say in your friend and his wife , but saw also that it was a germ so imperfect and weak that it could not encounter the coming frosts and winds of the world without loss and decay , while , if they were parted now for a few years , it would grow and strengthen and expand , to the certainty of an infinitely higher and deeper and keener love through the endless ages to follow -- so that by suffering should come , in place of contented decline , abortion , and death , a troubled birth of joyous result in health and immortality ; -- suppose all this , and what then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5878 len. 26]: Faber was silent a moment , then answered , `` Your theory has but one fault : it is too good to be true . ''
Parsing [sent. 5879 len. 16]: `` My theory leaves plenty of difficulty , but has no such fault as that .
Parsing [sent. 5880 len. 14]: Why , what sort of a God would content you , Mr. Faber ?
Parsing [sent. 5881 len. 15]: The one idea is too bad , the other too good to be true .
Parsing [sent. 5882 len. 25]: Must you expand and pare until you get one exactly to the measure of yourself ere you can accept it as thinkable or possible ?
Parsing [sent. 5883 len. 15]: Why , a less God than that would not rest your soul a week .
Parsing [sent. 5884 len. 39]: The only possibility of believing in a God seems to me to lie in finding an idea of a God large enough , grand enough , pure enough , lovely enough to be fit to believe in . ''
Parsing [sent. 5885 len. 12]: `` And have you found such -- may I ask ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5886 len. 9]: `` I think I am finding such . ''
Parsing [sent. 5887 len. 4]: `` Where ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5888 len. 9]: `` In the man of the New Testament .
Parsing [sent. 5889 len. 20]: I have thought a little more about these things , I fancy , than you have , Mr. Faber .
Parsing [sent. 5890 len. 24]: I may come to be sure of something ; I do n't see how a man can ever be sure of NOTHING . ''
Parsing [sent. 5891 len. 28]: `` Do n't suppose me quite dumbfoundered , though I ca n't answer you off hand , '' said Mr. Faber , as they reached his door .
Parsing [sent. 5892 len. 21]: -- `` Come in with me , and I will make up the medicine myself ; it will save time .
Parsing [sent. 5893 len. 42]: There are a thousand difficulties , '' he resumed in the surgery , `` some of them springing from peculiar points that come before one of my profession , which I doubt if you would be able to meet so readily .
Parsing [sent. 5894 len. 8]: But about this poor fellow , Lingard .
Parsing [sent. 5895 len. 13]: You know Glaston gossip says he is out of his mind . ''
Parsing [sent. 5896 len. 18]: `` If I were you , Mr. Faber , I would not take pains to contradict it .
Parsing [sent. 5897 len. 21]: He is not out of his mind , but has such trouble in it as might well drive him out .
Parsing [sent. 5898 len. 12]: -- Do n't you even hint at that , though . ''
Parsing [sent. 5899 len. 8]: `` I understand , '' said Faber .
Parsing [sent. 5900 len. 29]: `` If doctor and minister did understand each other and work together , '' said Wingfold , `` I fancy a good deal more might be done . ''
Parsing [sent. 5901 len. 7]: `` I do n't doubt it .
Parsing [sent. 5902 len. 20]: -- What sort of fellow is that cousin of theirs -- Bascombe is his name , I believe ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5903 len. 30]: `` A man to suit you , I should think , '' said the curate ; `` a man with a most tremendous power of believing in nothing . ''
Parsing [sent. 5904 len. 6]: `` Come , come ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5905 len. 26]: returned the doctor , `` you do n't know half enough about me to tell what sort of man I should like or dislike . ''
Parsing [sent. 5906 len. 53]: `` Well , all I will say more of Bascombe is , that if he were not conceited he would be honest ; and if he were as honest as he believes himself , he would not be so ready to judge every one dishonest who does not agree with him . ''
Parsing [sent. 5907 len. 20]: `` I hope we may have another talk soon , '' said the doctor , searching for a cork .
Parsing [sent. 5908 len. 16]: `` Some day I will tell you a few things that may stagger you . ''
Parsing [sent. 5909 len. 16]: `` Likely enough : I am only learning to walk yet , '' said Wingfold .
Parsing [sent. 5910 len. 24]: `` But a man may stagger and not fall , and I am ready to hear anything you choose to tell me . ''
Parsing [sent. 5911 len. 12]: Faber handed him the bottle , and he took his leave .
Parsing [sent. 5912 len. 3]: CHAPTER VII .
Parsing [sent. 5913 len. 5]: HELEN AND THE CURATE .
Parsing [sent. 5914 len. 53]: Before the morning Leopold lay wound in the net of a low fever , almost as ill as ever , but with this difference , that his mind was far less troubled , and that even his most restless dreams no longer scared him awake to a still nearer assurance of misery .
Parsing [sent. 5915 len. 41]: And yet , many a time , as she watched by his side , it was excruciatingly plain to Helen that the stuff of which his dreams were made was the last process to the final execution of the law .
Parsing [sent. 5916 len. 17]: She thought she could follow it all in his movements and the expressions of his countenance .
Parsing [sent. 5917 len. 37]: At a certain point , the cold dew always appeared on his forehead , after which invariably came a smile , and he would be quiet until near morning , when the same signs again appeared .
Parsing [sent. 5918 len. 41]: Sometimes he would murmur prayers , and sometimes it seemed to Helen that he must fancy himself talking face to face with Jesus , for the look of blessed and trustful awe upon his countenance was amazing in its beauty .
Parsing [sent. 5919 len. 14]: For Helen herself , she was prey to a host of changeful emotions .
Parsing [sent. 5920 len. 59]: At one time she accused herself bitterly of having been the cause of the return of his illness ; the next a gush of gladness would swell her heart at the thought that now she had him at least safer for a while , and that he might die and so escape the whole crowd of horrible possibilities .
Parsing [sent. 5921 len. 42]: For George 's manipulation of the magistrate could but delay the disclosure of the truth ; even should no discovery be made , Leopold must at length suspect a trick , and that would at once drive him to fresh action .
Parsing [sent. 5922 len. 85]: But amongst the rest , a feeling which had but lately begun to indicate its far-off presence now threatened to bring with it a deeper and more permanent sorrow : it became more and more plain to her that she had taken the evil part against the one she loved best in the world ; that she had been as a Satan to him ; had driven him back , stood almost bodily in the way to turn him from the path of peace .
Parsing [sent. 5923 len. 116]: Whether the path he had sought to follow was the only one or not , it was the only one he knew ; and that it was at least A true one , was proved by the fact that he had already found in it the beginnings of the peace he sought ; while she , for the avoidance of shame and pity , for the sake of the family , as she had said to herself , had pursued a course which if successful , would at best have resulted in shutting him up , as in a madhouse , with his own inborn horrors , with vain remorse , and equally vain longing .
Parsing [sent. 5924 len. 31]: Her conscience , now that her mind was quieter , from the greater distance to which the threatening peril had again withdrawn , had taken the opportunity of speaking louder .
Parsing [sent. 5925 len. 29]: And she listened -- but still with one question ever presented : Why might he not appropriate the consolations of the gospel without committing the suicide of surrender ?
Parsing [sent. 5926 len. 21]: She could not see that confession was the very door of refuge and safety , towards which he must press .
Parsing [sent. 5927 len. 47]: George 's absence was now again a relief , and while she feared and shrank from the severity of Wingfold , she could not help a certain indiscribable sense of safety in his presence -- at least so long as Leopold was too ill to talk .
Parsing [sent. 5928 len. 48]: For the curate , he became more and more interested in the woman who could love so strongly , and yet not entirely , who suffered and must still suffer so much , and who a faith even no greater than his own might render comparatively blessed .
Parsing [sent. 5929 len. 21]: The desire to help her grew and grew in him , but he could see no way of reaching her .
Parsing [sent. 5930 len. 43]: And then he began to discover one peculiar advantage belonging to the little open chamber of the pulpit -- open not only or specially to heaven above , but to so many of the secret chambers of the souls of the congregation .
Parsing [sent. 5931 len. 81]: For what a man dares not , could not if he dared , and dared not if he could , say to another , even at the time and in the place fittest of all , he can say thence , open-faced before the whole congregation ; and the person in need thereof may hear it without umbrage , or the choking husk of individual application , irritating to the rejection of what truth may lie in it for him .
Parsing [sent. 5932 len. 26]: Would that our pulpits were all in the power of such men as by suffering know the human , and by obedience the divine heart !
Parsing [sent. 5933 len. 68]: Then would the office of instruction be no more mainly occupied by the press , but the faces of true men would everywhere be windows for the light of the Spirit to enter other men 's souls , and the voice of their words would follow with the forms of what truth they saw , and the power of the Lord would speed from heart to heart .
Parsing [sent. 5934 len. 21]: Then would men soon understand that not the form of even soundest words availeth anything , but a new creature .
Parsing [sent. 5935 len. 56]: When Wingfold was in the pulpit , then , he could speak as from the secret to the secret ; but elsewhere he felt , in regard to Helen , like a transport-ship filled with troops , which must go sailing around the shores of an invaded ally , in frustrate search for a landing .
Parsing [sent. 5936 len. 30]: Oh , to help that woman , that the light of life might go up in her heart , and her cheek bloom again with the rose of peace !
Parsing [sent. 5937 len. 35]: But not a word could he speak in her presence , for he heard everything be would have said as he thought it would sound to her , and therefore he had no utterance .
Parsing [sent. 5938 len. 74]: Is it an infirmity of certain kinds of men , or a wise provision for their protection , that the brightest forms the truth takes in their private cogitations seem to lose half their lustre and all their grace when uttered in the presence of an unreceptive nature , and they hear , as it were , their own voice reflected in a poor , dull , inharmonious echo , and are disgusted ?
Parsing [sent. 5939 len. 62]: But , on the other hand , ever in the pauses of the rushing , ever in the watery gleams of life that broke through the clouds and drifts of the fever , Leopold sought his friend , and , finding him , shone into a brief radiance , or , missing him , gloomed back into the land of visions .
Parsing [sent. 5940 len. 37]: The tenderness of the curate 's service , the heart that showed itself in everything he did , even in the turn and expression of the ministering hand , was a kind of revelation to Helen .
Parsing [sent. 5941 len. 44]: For while his intellect was hanging about the door , asking questions , and uneasily shifting hither and thither in its unloved perplexities , the spirit of the master had gone by it unseen , and entered into the chamber of his heart .
Parsing [sent. 5942 len. 26]: After preaching the sermon last recorded , there came a reaction of doubt and depression on the mind of the curate , greater than usual .
Parsing [sent. 5943 len. 9]: Had he not gone farther than his right ?
Parsing [sent. 5944 len. 10]: Had he not implied more conviction than was his ?
Parsing [sent. 5945 len. 49]: Words could not go beyond his satisfaction with what he found in the gospel , or the hopes for the range of his conscious life springing therefrom ; but was he not now making people suppose him more certain of the FACT of these things than he was ?
Parsing [sent. 5946 len. 59]: He was driven to console himself with the reflection that so long as he had had no such intention , even if he had been so carried away by the delight of his heart as to give such an impression , it mattered little : what was it to other people what he believed or how he believed ?
Parsing [sent. 5947 len. 14]: If he had not been untrue to himself , no harm would follow .
Parsing [sent. 5948 len. 18]: Was a man never to talk from the highest in him to the forgetting of the lower ?
Parsing [sent. 5949 len. 16]: Was a man never to be carried beyond himself and the regions of his knowledge ?
Parsing [sent. 5950 len. 15]: If so , then farewell poetry and prophecy -- yea , all grand discovery !
Parsing [sent. 5951 len. 18]: -- for things must be foreseen ere they can be realized -- apprehended ere they be comprehended .
Parsing [sent. 5952 len. 62]: This much he could say for himself , and no more , that he was ready to lay down his life for the mere CHANCE , if he might so use the word , of these things being true ; nor did he argue any devotion in that , seeing life without them would be to him a waste of unreality .
Parsing [sent. 5953 len. 42]: He could bear witness to no facts -- but to the truth , to the loveliness and harmony and righteousness and safety that he saw in the idea of the Son of Man -- as he read it in the story .
Parsing [sent. 5954 len. 43]: He dared not say what , in a time of persecution , torture might work upon him , but he felt right hopeful that , even were he base enough to deny him , any cock might crow him back to repentance .
Parsing [sent. 5955 len. 44]: At the same time he saw plain enough that even if he gave his body to be burned , it were no sufficing assurance of his Christianity : nothing could satisfy him of that less than the conscious presence of the perfect charity .
Parsing [sent. 5956 len. 17]: Without that he was still outside the kingdom , wandering in a dream around its walls .
Parsing [sent. 5957 len. 43]: Difficulties went on presenting themselves ; at times he would be overwhelmed in the tossing waves of contradiction and impossibility ; but still his head would come up into the air and he would get a breath before he went down again .
Parsing [sent. 5958 len. 25]: And with every fresh conflict , every fresh gleam of doubtful victory , the essential idea of the master looked more and more lovely .
Parsing [sent. 5959 len. 60]: And he began to see the working of his doubts on the growth of his heart and soul -- both widening and realizing his faith , and preventing it from becoming faith in an idea of God instead of in the living God -- the God beyond as well as in the heart that thought and willed and imagined .
Parsing [sent. 5960 len. 16]: He had much time for reflection as he sat silent by the bedside of Leopold .
Parsing [sent. 5961 len. 31]: Sometimes Helen would be sitting near , though generally when he arrived she went out for her walk , but never anything came to him he could utter to her .
Parsing [sent. 5962 len. 13]: And she was one of those who learn little from other people .
Parsing [sent. 5963 len. 13]: A change must pass upon her ere she could be rightly receptive .
Parsing [sent. 5964 len. 16]: Some vapour or other that clouded her being must be driven to the winds first .
Parsing [sent. 5965 len. 37]: Mrs. Ramshorn had become at least reconciled to the frequent presence of the curate , partly from the testimony of Helen , partly from the witness of her own eyes to the quality of his ministrations .
Parsing [sent. 5966 len. 100]: She was by no means one of the loveliest among women , yet she had a heart , and could appreciate some kinds of goodness which the arrogance of her relation to the church did not interfere to hide -- for nothing is so deadening to the divine as an habitual dealing with the outsides of holy things -- and she became half-friendly and quite courteous when she met the curate on the stair , and would now and then , when she thought of it , bring him a glass of wine as he sat by the bedside .
Parsing [sent. 5967 len. 3]: CHAPTER VIII .
Parsing [sent. 5968 len. 3]: AN EXAMINATION .
Parsing [sent. 5969 len. 13]: The acquaintance between the draper and the gate-keeper rapidly ripened into friendship .
Parsing [sent. 5970 len. 38]: Very generally , as soon as he had shut his shop , Drew would walk to the park-gate to see Polwarth ; and three times a week at least , the curate made one of the party .
Parsing [sent. 5971 len. 20]: Much was then talked , more was thought , and I venture to say , more yet was understood .
Parsing [sent. 5972 len. 16]: One evening the curate went earlier than usual , and had tea with the Polwarths .
Parsing [sent. 5973 len. 29]: `` Do you remember , '' he asked of his host , `` once putting to me the question what our Lord came into this world for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5974 len. 8]: `` I do , '' answered Polwarth .
Parsing [sent. 5975 len. 19]: `` And you remember I answered you wrong : I said it was to save the world . ''
Parsing [sent. 5976 len. 4]: `` I do .
Parsing [sent. 5977 len. 21]: But remember , I said _ primarily _ , for of course he did come to save the world . ''
Parsing [sent. 5978 len. 9]: `` Yes , just so you put it .
Parsing [sent. 5979 len. 23]: Well , I think I can answer the question correctly now , and in learning the true answer I have learned much .
Parsing [sent. 5980 len. 15]: Did he not come first of all to do the will of his Father ?
Parsing [sent. 5981 len. 24]: Was not his Father first with him always and in everything -- his fellow-men next -- for they were his Father 's ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5982 len. 14]: `` I need not say it -- you know that you are right .
Parsing [sent. 5983 len. 20]: Jesus is tenfold a real person to you -- is he not -- since you discovered that truth ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5984 len. 9]: `` I think so ; I hope so .
Parsing [sent. 5985 len. 41]: It does seem as if a grand simple reality had begun to dawn upon me out of the fog -- the form as of a man pure and simple , _ because _ the eternal son of the Father . ''
Parsing [sent. 5986 len. 24]: `` And now , may I not ask -- are you able to accept the miracles , things in themselves so improbable ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5987 len. 45]: `` If we suppose the question settled as to whether the man was what he said , then all that remains is to ask whether the works reported of him are consistent with what you can see of the character of the man . ''
Parsing [sent. 5988 len. 9]: `` And to you they seem -- ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5989 len. 7]: `` Some consistent , others not .
Parsing [sent. 5990 len. 10]: Concerning the latter I look for more light . ''
Parsing [sent. 5991 len. 11]: `` Meantime let me ask you a question about them .
Parsing [sent. 5992 len. 9]: What was the main object of miracles ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5993 len. 30]: `` One thing at least I have learned , Mr. Polwarth and that is , not to answer any question of yours in a hurry , '' said Wingfold .
Parsing [sent. 5994 len. 23]: `` I will , if you please , take this one home with me , and hold the light to it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5995 len. 19]: `` Do , '' said Polwarth , `` and you will find it return you the light threefold .
Parsing [sent. 5996 len. 21]: -- One word more , ere Mr. Drew comes : do you still think of giving up your curacy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5997 len. 13]: `` I have almost forgotten I ever thought of such a thing .
Parsing [sent. 5998 len. 32]: Whatever energies I may or may not have , I know one thing for certain , that I could not devote them to anything else I should think entirely worth doing .
Parsing [sent. 5999 len. 36]: Indeed nothing else seems interesting enough -- nothing to repay the labour , but the telling of my fellow-men about the one man who is the truth , and to know whom is the life .
Parsing [sent. 6000 len. 27]: Even if there be no hereafter , I would live my time believing in a grand thing that ought to be true if it is not .
Parsing [sent. 6001 len. 27]: No facts can take the place of truths , and if these be not truths , then is the loftiest part of our nature a waste .
Parsing [sent. 6002 len. 56]: Let me hold by the better than the actual , and fall into nothingness off the same precipice with Jesus and John and Paul and a thousand more , who were lovely in their lives , and with their death make even the nothingness into which they have passed like the garden of the Lord .
Parsing [sent. 6003 len. 32]: I will go further , Polwarth , and say , I would rather die for evermore believing as Jesus believed , than live for evermore believing as those that deny him .
Parsing [sent. 6004 len. 37]: If there be no God , I feel assured that existence is and could be but a chaos of contradictions , whence can emerge nothing worthy to be called a truth , nothing worth living for .
Parsing [sent. 6005 len. 11]: -- No , I will not give up my curacy .
Parsing [sent. 6006 len. 100]: I will teach that which IS good , even if there should be no God to make a fact of it , and I will spend my life on it , in the growing hope , which MAY become assurance , that there is indeed a perfect God , worthy of being the Father of Jesus Christ , and that it was BECAUSE they are true , that these things were lovely to me and to so many men and women , of whom some have died for them , and some would be yet ready to die . ''
Parsing [sent. 6007 len. 11]: `` I thank my God to hear you say so .
Parsing [sent. 6008 len. 11]: Nor will you stand still there , '' said Polwarth .
Parsing [sent. 6009 len. 8]: `` But here comes Mr. Drew ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6010 len. 3]: CHAPTER IX .
Parsing [sent. 6011 len. 2]: IMMORTALITY .
Parsing [sent. 6012 len. 6]: `` How goes business ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6013 len. 10]: said Polwarth , when the new-comer had seated himself .
Parsing [sent. 6014 len. 38]: `` That is hardly a question I look for from you , sir , '' returned the draper , smiling all over his round face , which looked more than ever like a moon of superior intelligence .
Parsing [sent. 6015 len. 17]: `` For me , I am glad to leave it behind me in the shop . ''
Parsing [sent. 6016 len. 11]: `` True business can never be left in any shop .
Parsing [sent. 6017 len. 16]: It is a care , white or black , that sits behind every horseman . ''
Parsing [sent. 6018 len. 31]: `` That is fact ; and with me it has just taken a new shape , '' said Drew , `` for I have come with quite a fresh difficulty .
Parsing [sent. 6019 len. 31]: Since I saw you last , Mr. Polwarth , a strange and very uncomfortable doubt has rushed in upon me , and I find myself altogether unfit to tackle it .
Parsing [sent. 6020 len. 14]: I have no weapons -- not a single argument of the least weight .
Parsing [sent. 6021 len. 46]: I wonder if it be a law of nature that no sooner shall a man get into a muddle with one thing , than a thousand other muddles shall come pouring in upon him , as if Muddle itself were going to swallow him up !
Parsing [sent. 6022 len. 84]: Here am I just beginning to get a little start in honester ways , when up comes the ugly head of the said doubt , swelling itself more and more to look like a fact -- namely , that after this world there is nothing for us -- nothing at all to be had anyhow -- that as we came so we go -- into life , out of life -- that , having been nothing before , we shall be nothing after !
Parsing [sent. 6023 len. 27]: The flowers come back in the spring , and the corn in the autumn , but they ai n't the same flowers or the same corn .
Parsing [sent. 6024 len. 13]: They 're just as different as the new generations of men . ''
Parsing [sent. 6025 len. 11]: `` There 's no pretence that we come back either .
Parsing [sent. 6026 len. 17]: We only think we do n't go into the ground , but away somewhere else . ''
Parsing [sent. 6027 len. 8]: `` You ca n't prove that . ''
Parsing [sent. 6028 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 6029 len. 11]: `` And you do n't know anything about it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6030 len. 11]: `` Not much -- but enough , I think . ''
Parsing [sent. 6031 len. 23]: `` Why , even those that profess to believe it , scoff at the idea of an apparition -- a ghost ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6032 len. 16]: `` That 's the fault of the ghosts , I suspect -- or their reporters .
Parsing [sent. 6033 len. 8]: I do n't care about them myself .
Parsing [sent. 6034 len. 22]: I prefer the tale of one who , they say , rose again , and brought his body with him . ''
Parsing [sent. 6035 len. 10]: `` Yes ; but he was only one ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6036 len. 16]: `` Except two or three whom , they say , he brought to life . ''
Parsing [sent. 6037 len. 10]: `` Still there are but three or four . ''
Parsing [sent. 6038 len. 19]: `` To tell you the truth , I do not care much to argue the point with you .
Parsing [sent. 6039 len. 21]: -- It is by no means a matter of the FIRST importance whether we live for ever or not . ''
Parsing [sent. 6040 len. 5]: `` Mr. Polwarth ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6041 len. 28]: exclaimed the draper in such astonishment mingled with horror , as proved he was not in immediate danger of becoming an advocate of the doctrine of extinction .
Parsing [sent. 6042 len. 24]: The gate-keeper smiled what , but for a peculiar expression of undefinable good in it , might have been called a knowing smile .
Parsing [sent. 6043 len. 39]: `` Suppose a thing were in itself not worth having , '' he said , `` would it be any great enhancement of it as a gift to add the assurance that the possession of it was eternal !
Parsing [sent. 6044 len. 71]: Most people think it a fine thing to have a bit of land to call their own and leave to their children ; but suppose a stinking and undrainable swamp , full of foul springs -- what consolation would it be to the proprietor of that to know , while the world lasted , not a human being would once dispute its possession with any fortunate descendant holding it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6045 len. 13]: The draper only stared , but his stare was a thorough one .
Parsing [sent. 6046 len. 28]: The curate sat waiting , with both amusement and interest , for what would follow : he saw the direction in which the little man was driving .
Parsing [sent. 6047 len. 6]: `` You astonish me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6048 len. 9]: said Mr. Drew , recovering his mental breath .
Parsing [sent. 6049 len. 14]: `` How can you compare God 's gift to such a horrible thing !
Parsing [sent. 6050 len. 8]: Where should we be without life ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6051 len. 14]: Rachel burst out laughing , and the curate could not help joining her .
Parsing [sent. 6052 len. 44]: `` Mr. Drew , '' said Polwarth , half merrily , `` are you going to help me drag my chain out of its weary length , or are you too much shocked at the doubtful condition of its links to touch them ?
Parsing [sent. 6053 len. 12]: I promise you the last shall be of bright gold . ''
Parsing [sent. 6054 len. 23]: `` I beg your pardon , '' said the draper ; `` I might have known you did n't mean it . ''
Parsing [sent. 6055 len. 14]: `` On the contrary , I mean everything I say and that literally .
Parsing [sent. 6056 len. 11]: Perhaps I do n't mean everything you fancy I mean .
Parsing [sent. 6057 len. 18]: -- Tell me then , would life be worth having on any and every possible condition ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6058 len. 5]: `` Certainly not . ''
Parsing [sent. 6059 len. 33]: `` You know some , I dare say , who would be glad to be rid of life such as it is , and such as they suppose it must continue ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6060 len. 6]: `` I do n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 6061 len. 5]: `` I do . ''
Parsing [sent. 6062 len. 12]: `` I have already understood that everybody clung to life . ''
Parsing [sent. 6063 len. 16]: `` Most people do ; everybody certainly does not : Job , for instance . ''
Parsing [sent. 6064 len. 10]: `` They say that is but a poem . ''
Parsing [sent. 6065 len. 5]: `` BUT a poem !
Parsing [sent. 6066 len. 19]: EVEN a poem -- a representation true not of this or that individual , but of the race !
Parsing [sent. 6067 len. 22]: There ARE such persons as would gladly be rid of life , and in their condition all would feel the same .
Parsing [sent. 6068 len. 33]: Somewhat similar is the state of those who profess unbelief in the existence of God : none of them expect , and few of them seem to wish to live for ever !
Parsing [sent. 6069 len. 10]: -- At least , so I am told . ''
Parsing [sent. 6070 len. 25]: `` That is no wonder , '' said the draper ; '' -- if they do n't believe in God , I mean . ''
Parsing [sent. 6071 len. 7]: `` Then there I have you !
Parsing [sent. 6072 len. 17]: There you allow life to be not worth having , if on certain evil conditions . ''
Parsing [sent. 6073 len. 8]: `` I admit it , then . ''
Parsing [sent. 6074 len. 17]: `` And I repeat that to prove life endless is a matter of the FIRST importance .
Parsing [sent. 6075 len. 8]: And I will go a little farther .
Parsing [sent. 6076 len. 21]: -- Does it follow that life is worth having because a man would like to have it for ever ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6077 len. 18]: `` I should say so ; who should be a better judge than the man himself ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6078 len. 9]: `` Let us look at it a moment .
Parsing [sent. 6079 len. 59]: Suppose -- we will take a strong case -- suppose a man whose whole delight is in cruelty , and who has such plentiful opportunity of indulging the passion that he finds it well with him -- such a man would of course desire such a life to endure for ever : is such a life worth having ?
Parsing [sent. 6080 len. 11]: were it well that man should be immortally cruel ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6081 len. 6]: `` Not for others . ''
Parsing [sent. 6082 len. 11]: `` Still less , I say , for himself . ''
Parsing [sent. 6083 len. 18]: `` In the judgment of others , doubtless ; but to himself he would be happy . ''
Parsing [sent. 6084 len. 70]: `` Call his horrible satisfaction happiness then , and leave aside the fact that in its own nature it is a horror , and not a bliss : a time must come , when , in the exercise of his delight , he shall have destroyed all life besides , and made himself alone with himself in an empty world : will he then find life worth having ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6085 len. 10]: `` Then he ought to live for punishment . ''
Parsing [sent. 6086 len. 43]: `` With that we have nothing to do now , but there you have given me an answer to my question , whether a man 's judgment that his life is worth having , proves immortality a thing to be desired . ''
Parsing [sent. 6087 len. 4]: `` I have .
Parsing [sent. 6088 len. 5]: I understand now . ''
Parsing [sent. 6089 len. 23]: `` It follows that there is something of prior importance to the possession of immortality : -- what is that something ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6090 len. 13]: `` I suppose that the immortality itself should be worth possessing . ''
Parsing [sent. 6091 len. 18]: `` Yes ; that the life should be such that it were well it should be endless .
Parsing [sent. 6092 len. 11]: -- And what then if it be not such ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6093 len. 15]: `` The question then would be whether it could not be made such . ''
Parsing [sent. 6094 len. 5]: `` You are right .
Parsing [sent. 6095 len. 14]: -- And wherein consists the essential inherent worthiness of a life as life ?
Parsing [sent. 6096 len. 17]: -- The only perfect idea of life is -- a unit , self-existent , and creative .
Parsing [sent. 6097 len. 8]: That is God , the only one .
Parsing [sent. 6098 len. 134]: But to this idea , in its kind , must every life , to be complete as life , correspond ; and the human correspondence to self-existence is , that the man should round and complete himself by taking into himself that origin ; by going back and in his own will adopting his origin , rooting therein afresh in the exercise of his own freedom and in all the energy of his own self-roused will ; in other words -- that the man say `` I will be after the will of the creating _ I _ ; '' that he see and say with his whole being that to will the will of God in himself and for himself and concerning himself , is the highest possible condition of a man .
Parsing [sent. 6099 len. 33]: Then has he completed his cycle by turning back upon his history , laying hold of his cause , and willing his own being in the will of the only I AM .
Parsing [sent. 6100 len. 12]: This is the rounding , re-creating , unifying of the man .
Parsing [sent. 6101 len. 16]: This is religion , and all that gathers not with this , scatters abroad . ''
Parsing [sent. 6102 len. 32]: `` And then , '' said Drew , with some eagerness , `` lawfully comes the question , ` Shall I , or shall I not live for ever ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 6103 len. 14]: `` Pardon me ; I think not , '' returned the little prophet .
Parsing [sent. 6104 len. 12]: `` I think rather we have done with it for ever .
Parsing [sent. 6105 len. 18]: The man with life so in himself , will not dream of asking whether he shall live .
Parsing [sent. 6106 len. 42]: It is only in the twilight of a half-life , holding in it at once much wherefore it should desire its own continuance , and much that renders it unworthy of continuance , that the doubtful desire of immortality can arise .
Parsing [sent. 6107 len. 42]: -- Do you remember '' -- here Polwarth turned to Wingfold -- `` my mentioning to you once a certain manuscript of strange interest -- to me at least and Rachel -- which a brother of mine left behind him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6108 len. 12]: `` I remember it perfectly , '' answered the curate . ''
Parsing [sent. 6109 len. 36]: `` It seems so to mingle with all I ever think on this question , that I should much like , if you gentlemen would allow me , to read some extracts from it . ''
Parsing [sent. 6110 len. 28]: Nothing could have been heartier than the assurance of both the men that they could but be delighted to listen to anything he chose to give them .
Parsing [sent. 6111 len. 60]: `` I must first tell you , however , '' said Polwarth , `` merely to protect you from certain disturbing speculations , otherwise sure to present themselves , that my poor brother was mad , and that what I now read portions of seemed to him no play of the imagination , but a record of absolute fact .
Parsing [sent. 6112 len. 43]: Some parts are stranger and less intelligible than others , but through it all there is abundance of intellectual movement , and what seems to me a wonderful keenness to perceive the movements and arrest the indications of an imagined consciousness . ''
Parsing [sent. 6113 len. 19]: As he spoke , the little man was opening a cabinet in which he kept his precious things .
Parsing [sent. 6114 len. 31]: He brought from it a good-sized quarto volume , neatly bound in morocco , with gilt edges , which he seemed to handle not merely with respect but with tenderness .
Parsing [sent. 6115 len. 18]: The heading of the next chapter is my own , and does not belong to the manuscript .
Parsing [sent. 6116 len. 13]: CHAPTER X. PASSAGES FROM THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF THE WANDERING JEW . '' '
Parsing [sent. 6117 len. 37]: I have at length been ill , very ill , once more , and for many reasons foreign to the weightiest , which I had forgotten , I had hoped that I was going to die .
Parsing [sent. 6118 len. 10]: But therein I am as usual deceived and disappointed .
Parsing [sent. 6119 len. 23]: That I have been out of my mind I know , by having returned to the real knowledge of what I am .
Parsing [sent. 6120 len. 24]: The conscious present has again fallen together and made a whole with the past , and that whole is my personal identity . ''
Parsing [sent. 6121 len. 39]: ` How I broke loose from the bonds of a madness , which , after so many and heavy years of uninterrupted sanity , had at length laid hold upon me , I will now relate . '' '
Parsing [sent. 6122 len. 38]: I had , as I have said , been very ill -- with some sort of fever that had found fit rooting in a brain overwearied , from not having been originally constructed to last so long .
Parsing [sent. 6123 len. 23]: Whether it came not of an indwelling demon , or a legion of demons , I can not tell -- God knows .
Parsing [sent. 6124 len. 7]: Surely I was as one possessed .
Parsing [sent. 6125 len. 17]: I was mad , whether for years , or but for moments -- who can tell ?
Parsing [sent. 6126 len. 4]: I can not .
Parsing [sent. 6127 len. 44]: Verily it seems for many years ; but , knowing well the truth concerning the relations of time in him that dreameth and waketh from his dream , I place no confidence in the testimony of the impressions left upon my seeming memory .
Parsing [sent. 6128 len. 18]: I can however trust it sufficiently as to the character of the illusions that then possessed me .
Parsing [sent. 6129 len. 14]: I imagined myself an Englishman called Polwarth , of an ancient Cornish family .
Parsing [sent. 6130 len. 34]: Indeed , I had in my imagination , as Polwarth , gone through the history , every day of it , with its sunrise and sunset , of more than half a lifetime .
Parsing [sent. 6131 len. 83]: I had a brother who was deformed and a dwarf , and a daughter who was like him ; and the only thing , throughout the madness , that approached a consciousness of my real being and history , was the impression that these things had come upon me because of a certain grievous wrong I had at one time committed , which wrong , however , I had quite forgotten -- and could ill have imagined in its native hideousness . ''
Parsing [sent. 6132 len. 71]: ` But one morning , just as I woke , after a restless night filled with dreams , I was aware of a half-embodied shadow in my mind -- whether thought or memory or imagination , I could not tell : and the strange thing was , that it darkly radiated from it the conviction that I must hold and identify it , or be for ever lost to myself .
Parsing [sent. 6133 len. 53]: Therefore , with all the might of my will to retain the shadow , and all the energy of my recollection to recall that of which it was the vague shadow , I concentrated the whole power of my spiritual man upon the phantom thought , to fix and retain it . ''
Parsing [sent. 6134 len. 13]: ` Everyone knows what it is to hunt such a formless fact .
Parsing [sent. 6135 len. 24]: Evanescent as a rainbow , its whole appearance , from the first , is that of a thing in the act of vanishing .
Parsing [sent. 6136 len. 25]: It is a thing that was known , but , from the moment consciousness turned its lantern upon it , began to become invisible .
Parsing [sent. 6137 len. 77]: For a time , during the close pursuit that follows , it seems only to be turning corner after corner to evade the mind 's eye , but behind every corner it leaves a portion of itself ; until at length , although when finally can not be told , it is gone so utterly that the mind remains aghast in the perplexity of the doubt whether ever there was a thought there at all . ''
Parsing [sent. 6138 len. 37]: ` Throughout my delusion of an English existence , I had been tormented in my wakings with such thought-phantoms , and ever had I followed them , as an idle man may follow a flitting marsh-fire .
Parsing [sent. 6139 len. 74]: Indeed , I had grown so much interested in the phenomenon and its possible indications that I had invented various theories to account for them , some of which seemed to myself original and ingenious , while the common idea that they are vague reminiscences of a former state of being , I had again and again examined , and as often entirely rejected , as in no way tenable or verisimilar . ''
Parsing [sent. 6140 len. 31]: ` But upon the morning to which I have referred , I succeeded , for the first time , in fixing , capturing , identifying the haunting , fluttering thing .
Parsing [sent. 6141 len. 10]: That moment the bonds of my madness were broken .
Parsing [sent. 6142 len. 6]: My past returned upon me .
Parsing [sent. 6143 len. 27]: I had but to think in any direction , and every occurrence , with time and place and all its circumstance , rose again before me .
Parsing [sent. 6144 len. 74]: The awful fact of my own being once more stood bare -- awful always -- tenfold more awful after such a period of blissful oblivion thereof : I was , I had been , I am now , as I write , the man so mysterious in crime , so unlike all other men in his punishment , known by various names in various lands -- here in England as the Wandering Jew .
Parsing [sent. 6145 len. 7]: Ahasuerus was himself again , alas !
Parsing [sent. 6146 len. 6]: -- himself and no other .
Parsing [sent. 6147 len. 13]: Wife , daughter , brother vanished , and returned only in dreams .
Parsing [sent. 6148 len. 16]: I was and remain the wanderer , the undying , the repentant , the unforgiven .
Parsing [sent. 6149 len. 3]: O heart !
Parsing [sent. 6150 len. 4]: O weary feet !
Parsing [sent. 6151 len. 21]: O eyes that have seen and never more shall see , until they see once and are blinded for ever !
Parsing [sent. 6152 len. 45]: Back upon my soul rushes the memory of my deed , like a storm of hail mingled with fire , flashing through every old dry channel , that it throbs and writhes anew , scorched at once and torn with the poisonous burning . ''
Parsing [sent. 6153 len. 3]: CHAPTER XI .
Parsing [sent. 6154 len. 5]: THE WANDERING JEW . ''
Parsing [sent. 6155 len. 35]: ` It was a fair summer-morning in holy Jerusalem , and I sat and wrought at my trade , for I sewed a pair of sandals for the feet of the high priest Caiaphas .
Parsing [sent. 6156 len. 33]: And I wrought diligently , for it behoved me to cease an hour ere set of sun , for it was the day of preparation for the eating of the Passover . ''
Parsing [sent. 6157 len. 58]: ` Now all that night there had been a going to and fro in the city , for the chief priests and their followers had at length laid hands upon him that was called Jesus , whom some believed to be the Messiah , and others , with my fool-self amongst them , an arch-impostor and blasphemer .
Parsing [sent. 6158 len. 35]: For I was of the house of Caiaphas , and heartily did desire that the man my lord declared a deceiver of the people , should meet with the just reward of his doings .
Parsing [sent. 6159 len. 21]: Thus I sat and worked , and thought and rejoiced ; and the morning passed and the noon came . ''
Parsing [sent. 6160 len. 50]: ` It was a day of sultry summer , and the street burned beneath the sun , and I sat in the shadow and looked out upon the glare ; and ever I wrought at the sandals of my lord , with many fine stitches , in cunning workmanship .
Parsing [sent. 6161 len. 19]: All had been for some time very still , when suddenly I thought I heard a far-off tumult .
Parsing [sent. 6162 len. 31]: And soon came the idle children , who ever run first that they be not swallowed up of the crowd ; and they ran and looked behind as they ran .
Parsing [sent. 6163 len. 48]: And after them came the crowd , crying and shouting , and swaying hither and thither ; and in the midst of it arose the one arm of a cross , beneath the weight of which that same Jesus bent so low that I saw him not .
Parsing [sent. 6164 len. 60]: Truly , said I , he hath not seldom borne heavier burdens in the workshop of his father the Galilean , but now his sins and his idleness have found him , and taken from him his vigour ; for he that despiseth the law shall perish , while they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength .
Parsing [sent. 6165 len. 33]: For I was wroth with the man who taught the people to despise the great ones that administered the law , and give honour to the small ones who only kept it .
Parsing [sent. 6166 len. 57]: Besides , he had driven my father 's brother from the court of the Gentiles with a whip , which truly hurt him not outwardly , but stung him to the soul ; and yet that very temple which he pretended thus to honour , he had threatened to destroy and build again in three days !
Parsing [sent. 6167 len. 52]: Such were the thoughts of my heart ; and when I learned from the boys that it was in truth Jesus of Nazareth who passed on his way to Calvary to be crucified , my heart leaped within me at the thought that the law had at length overtaken the malefactor .
Parsing [sent. 6168 len. 23]: I laid down the sandal and my awl , and rose and went forth and stood in the front of my shop .
Parsing [sent. 6169 len. 22]: And Jesus drew nigh , and as he passed , lo , the end of the cross dragged upon the street .
Parsing [sent. 6170 len. 25]: And one in the crowd came behind , and lifted it up and pushed therewith , so that Jesus staggered and had nigh fallen .
Parsing [sent. 6171 len. 29]: Then would be fain have rested the arm of the cross on the stone by which I was wont to go up into my shop from the street .
Parsing [sent. 6172 len. 21]: But I cried out , and drove him thence , saying scornfully , `` Go on Jesus ; go on .
Parsing [sent. 6173 len. 10]: Truly thou restest not on stone of mine ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6174 len. 51]: Then turned he his eyes upon me , and said , `` I go indeed , but thou goest not ; '' and therewith he rose again under the weight of the cross , and staggered on , '' ` And I followed in the crowd to Calvary . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 6175 len. 18]: Here the reader paused and said , `` I can give you but a few passages now .
Parsing [sent. 6176 len. 8]: You see it is a large manuscript .
Parsing [sent. 6177 len. 19]: I will therefore choose some of those that bear upon the subject of which we have been talking .
Parsing [sent. 6178 len. 19]: A detailed account of the crucifixion follows here , which I could not bring myself to read aloud .
Parsing [sent. 6179 len. 26]: The eclipse is in it , and the earthquake , and the white faces of the risen dead gleaming through the darkness about the cross .
Parsing [sent. 6180 len. 49]: It ends thus : '' ` And all the time , I stood not far from the foot of the cross , nor dared go nearer , for around it were his mother and they that were with her , and my heart was sore for her also .
Parsing [sent. 6181 len. 39]: And I would have withdrawn my foot from the place where I stood , and gone home to weep , but something , I know not what , held me there as it were rooted to the ground .
Parsing [sent. 6182 len. 8]: At length the end was drawing near .
Parsing [sent. 6183 len. 46]: He opened his mouth and spake to his mother and the disciple who stood by her , but truly I know not what he said , for as his eyes turned from them , they looked upon me , and my heart died within me .
Parsing [sent. 6184 len. 44]: He said nought , but his eyes had that in them that would have slain me with sorrow , had not death , although I knew it not , already shrunk from my presence , daring no more come nigh such a malefactor .
Parsing [sent. 6185 len. 44]: -- Oh Death , how gladly would I build thee a temple , set thee in a lofty place , and worship thee with the sacrifice of vultures on a fire of dead men 's bones , wouldst thou but hear my cry !
Parsing [sent. 6186 len. 9]: -- But I rave again in my folly !
Parsing [sent. 6187 len. 4]: God forgive me .
Parsing [sent. 6188 len. 15]: All the days of my appointed time will I wait until my change come .
Parsing [sent. 6189 len. 26]: -- With that look -- a well of everlasting tears in my throbbing brain -- my feet were unrooted , and I fled . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 6190 len. 13]: Here the reader paused again , and turned over many leaves . ''
Parsing [sent. 6191 len. 92]: ` And ever as I passed at night through the lands , when I came to a cross by the wayside , thereon would I climb , and , winding my arms about its arms and my feet about its stem , would there hang in the darkness or the moon , in rain or hail , in wind or snow or frost , until my sinews gave way , and my body dropped , and I knew no more until I found myself lying at its foot in the morning .
Parsing [sent. 6192 len. 21]: For , ever in such case , I lay without sense until again the sun shone upon me . '' '
Parsing [sent. 6193 len. 51]: ... And if ever the memory of that look passed from me , then , straightway I began to long for death , and so longed until the memory and the power of the look came again , and with the sorrow in my soul came the patience to live .
Parsing [sent. 6194 len. 73]: And truly , although I speak of forgetting and remembering , such motions of my spirit in me were not as those of another man ; in me they are not measured by the scale of men 's lives ; they are not of years , but of centuries ; for the seconds of my life are ticked by a clock whose pendulum swings through an arc of motionless stars . '' '
Parsing [sent. 6195 len. 9]: ... Once I had a vision of Death .
Parsing [sent. 6196 len. 63]: Methinks it must have been a precursive vapour of the madness that afterwards infolded me , for I know well that there is not one called Death , that he is but a word needful to the weakness of human thought and the poverty of human speech ; that he is a no-being , and but a change from that which is .
Parsing [sent. 6197 len. 11]: -- I had a vision of Death , I say .
Parsing [sent. 6198 len. 61]: And it was on this wise : '' ' I was walking over a wide plain of sand , like Egypt , so that ever and anon I looked around me to see if nowhere , from the base of the horizon , the pyramids cut their triangle out of the blue night of heaven ; but I saw none .
Parsing [sent. 6199 len. 20]: The stars came down and sparkled on the dry sands , and all was waste , and wide desolation .
Parsing [sent. 6200 len. 34]: The air also was still as the air of a walled-up tomb , where there are but dry bones , and not even the wind of an evil vapour that rises from decay .
Parsing [sent. 6201 len. 23]: And through the dead air came ever the low moaning of a distant sea , towards which my feet did bear me .
Parsing [sent. 6202 len. 20]: I had been journeying thus for years , and in their lapse it had grown but a little louder .
Parsing [sent. 6203 len. 11]: -- Suddenly I was aware that I was not alone .
Parsing [sent. 6204 len. 14]: A dim figure strode beside me , vague , but certain of presence .
Parsing [sent. 6205 len. 24]: And I feared him not , seeing that which men fear the most was itself that which by me was the most desired .
Parsing [sent. 6206 len. 10]: So I stood and turned and would have spoken .
Parsing [sent. 6207 len. 16]: But the shade that seemed not a shadow , went on and regarded me not .
Parsing [sent. 6208 len. 15]: Then I also turned again towards the moaning of the sea and went on .
Parsing [sent. 6209 len. 3]: And lo !
Parsing [sent. 6210 len. 24]: the shade which had gone before until it seemed but as a vapour among the stars , was again by my side walking .
Parsing [sent. 6211 len. 56]: And I said , and stood not , but walked on : Thou shade that art not a shadow , seeing there shineth no sun or moon , and the stars are many , and the one slayeth the shadow of the other , what art thou , and wherefore goest thou by my side ?
Parsing [sent. 6212 len. 22]: Think not to make me afraid , for I fear nothing in the universe but that which I love the best .
Parsing [sent. 6213 len. 11]: -- I spake of the eyes of the Lord Jesus .
Parsing [sent. 6214 len. 48]: -- Then the shade that seemed no shadow answered me and spake and said : Little knowest thou what I am , seeing the very thing thou sayest I am not , that I am , and nought else , and there is no other but me .
Parsing [sent. 6215 len. 80]: I am Shadow , the shadow , the only shadow -- none such as those from which the light hideth in terror , yet like them , for life hideth from me and turneth away , yet if life were not , neither were I , for I am nothing ; and yet again , as soon as anything is , there am I , and needed no maker , but came of myself , for I am Death .
Parsing [sent. 6216 len. 3]: -- Ha !
Parsing [sent. 6217 len. 2]: Death !
Parsing [sent. 6218 len. 37]: I cried , and would have cast myself before him with outstretched arms of worshipful entreaty ; but lo , there was a shadow upon the belt of Orion , and no shadow by my side !
Parsing [sent. 6219 len. 13]: and I sighed , and walked on towards the ever moaning sea .
Parsing [sent. 6220 len. 9]: Then again the shadow was by my side .
Parsing [sent. 6221 len. 26]: And again I spake and said : Thou thing of flitting and return , I despise thee , for thou wilt not abide the conflict .
Parsing [sent. 6222 len. 21]: And I would have cast myself upon him and wrestled with him there , for defeat and not for victory .
Parsing [sent. 6223 len. 9]: But I could not lay hold upon him .
Parsing [sent. 6224 len. 16]: Thou art a powerless nothing , I cried ; I will not even defy thee .
Parsing [sent. 6225 len. 15]: -- Thou wouldst provoke me , said the shadow ; but it availeth not .
Parsing [sent. 6226 len. 6]: I can not be provoked .
Parsing [sent. 6227 len. 40]: Truly , I am but a shadow , yet know I my own worth , for I am the Shadow of the Almighty , and where he is , there am I -- Thou art nothing , I said .
Parsing [sent. 6228 len. 10]: -- Nay , nay , I am not Nothing .
Parsing [sent. 6229 len. 14]: Thou , nor any man -- God only knoweth what that word meaneth .
Parsing [sent. 6230 len. 52]: I am but the shadow of Nothing , and when THOU sayest NOTHING , thou meanest only me ; but what God meaneth when he sayeth NOTHING -- the nothing without him , that nothing which is no shadow but the very substance of Unbeing -- no created soul can know .
Parsing [sent. 6231 len. 7]: -- Then art thou not Death ?
Parsing [sent. 6232 len. 3]: I asked .
Parsing [sent. 6233 len. 21]: -- I am what thou thinkest of when thou sayest Death , he answered , but I am not Death .
Parsing [sent. 6234 len. 5]: -- Alas , then !
Parsing [sent. 6235 len. 33]: why comest thou to me in the desert places , for I did think thou wast Death indeed , and couldst take me unto thee so that I should be no more .
Parsing [sent. 6236 len. 30]: -- That is what death can not do for thee , said the shadow ; none but he that created thee can cause that thou shouldst be no more .
Parsing [sent. 6237 len. 10]: Thou art until he will that thou be not .
Parsing [sent. 6238 len. 24]: I have heard it said amongst the wise that , hard as it is to create , it is harder still to uncreate .
Parsing [sent. 6239 len. 6]: Truly I can not tell .
Parsing [sent. 6240 len. 11]: But wouldst thou be uncreated by the hand of Death ?
Parsing [sent. 6241 len. 11]: Wouldst thou have thy no-being the gift of a shadow ?
Parsing [sent. 6242 len. 35]: -- Then I thought of the eyes of the Lord Jesus , and the look he cast upon me , and I said , No : I would not be carried away of Death .
Parsing [sent. 6243 len. 14]: I would be fulfilled of Life , and stand before God for ever .
Parsing [sent. 6244 len. 18]: Then once again the belt of Orion grew dim , and I saw the shadow no more .
Parsing [sent. 6245 len. 28]: And yet did I long for Death , for I thought he might bring me to those eyes , and the pardon that lay in them . ''
Parsing [sent. 6246 len. 73]: ` But again , as the years went on , and each brought less hope than that before it , I forgot the look the Lord had cast upon me , and in the weariness of the life that was mortal and yet would not cease , in the longing after the natural end of that which against nature endured , I began to long even for the end of being itself .
Parsing [sent. 6247 len. 34]: And in a city of the Germans , I found certain men of my own nation who said unto me : Fear not , Ahasuerus ; there is no life beyond the grave .
Parsing [sent. 6248 len. 12]: Live on until thy end come , and cease thy complaints .
Parsing [sent. 6249 len. 24]: Who is there among us who would not gladly take upon him thy judgment , and live until he was weary of living ?
Parsing [sent. 6250 len. 11]: -- Yea , but to live after thou art weary ?
Parsing [sent. 6251 len. 3]: I said .
Parsing [sent. 6252 len. 45]: But they heeded me not , answering me and saying : Search thou the Scriptures , even the Book of the Law , and see if thou find there one leaf of this gourd of a faith that hath sprung up in a night .
Parsing [sent. 6253 len. 20]: Verily , this immortality is but a flash in the brain of men that would rise above their fate .
Parsing [sent. 6254 len. 18]: Sayeth Moses , or sayeth Job , or sayeth David or Daniel a word of the matter ?
Parsing [sent. 6255 len. 12]: And I listened unto them , and became of their mind .
Parsing [sent. 6256 len. 47]: But therewithal the longing after death returned with tenfold force and I rose up and girt my garment about me , and went forth once more to search for him whom I now took for the porter of the gate of eternal silence and unfelt repose .
Parsing [sent. 6257 len. 39]: And I said unto myself as I walked : What in the old days was sweeter when I was weary with my labour at making of shoes , than to find myself dropping into the death of sleep !
Parsing [sent. 6258 len. 28]: how much sweeter then must it not be to sink into the sleepiest of sleeps , the father-sleep , the mother-bosomed death of nothingness and unawaking rest !
Parsing [sent. 6259 len. 35]: Then shall all this endless whir of the wheels of thought and desire be over ; then welcome the night whose darkness doth not seethe , and which no morning shall ever stir ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6260 len. 44]: ` And wherever armies were drawing nigh , each to the other , and the day of battle was near , thither I flew in hot haste , that I might be first upon the field , and ready to welcome hottest peril .
Parsing [sent. 6261 len. 26]: I fought not , for I would not slay those that counted it not the good thing to be slain , as I counted it .
Parsing [sent. 6262 len. 33]: But had the armies been of men that loved death like me , how had I raged among them then , even as the angel Azrael to give them their sore-desired rest !
Parsing [sent. 6263 len. 31]: for I loved and hated not my kind , and would diligently have mown them down out of the stinging air of life into the soft balm of the sepulchre .
Parsing [sent. 6264 len. 23]: But what they sought not , and I therefore would not give , that searched I after the more eagerly for myself .
Parsing [sent. 6265 len. 34]: And my sight grew so keen that , when yet no bigger than a mote in the sunbeam , I could always descry the vulture-scout , hanging aloft over the field of destiny .
Parsing [sent. 6266 len. 21]: Then would I hasten on and on , until a swoop would have brought him straight on my head . ''
Parsing [sent. 6267 len. 33]: ` And with that a troop of horsemen , horses and men mad with living fear , came with a level rush towards the spot where I sat , faint with woe .
Parsing [sent. 6268 len. 26]: And I sprang up , and bounded to meet them , throwing my arms aloft and shouting , as one who would turn a herd .
Parsing [sent. 6269 len. 29]: And like a wave of the rising tide before a swift wind , a wave that sweeps on and breaks not , they came hard-buffeting over my head .
Parsing [sent. 6270 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 6271 len. 6]: that was a torrent indeed !
Parsing [sent. 6272 len. 21]: -- a thunderous succession of solid billows , alive , hurled along by the hurricane-fear in the heart of them !
Parsing [sent. 6273 len. 22]: For one moment only I felt and knew what I lay beneath , and then for a time there was nothing .
Parsing [sent. 6274 len. 37]: -- I woke in silence , and thought I was dying , that I had all but passed across the invisible line between , and in a moment there would be for evermore nothing and nothing .
Parsing [sent. 6275 len. 10]: Then followed again an empty space as it seemed .
Parsing [sent. 6276 len. 17]: And now I am dead and gone , I said , and shall wander no more .
Parsing [sent. 6277 len. 19]: And with that came the agony of hell , for , lo , still _ I _ THOUGHT !
Parsing [sent. 6278 len. 8]: And I said to myself , Alas !
Parsing [sent. 6279 len. 3]: O God !
Parsing [sent. 6280 len. 62]: for , notwithstanding I no more see or hear or taste or smell or touch , and my body hath dropped from me , still am I Ahasuerus , the Wanderer , and must go on and on and on , blind and deaf , through the unutterable wastes that know not the senses of man -- nevermore to find rest !
Parsing [sent. 6281 len. 2]: Alas !
Parsing [sent. 6282 len. 24]: death is not death , seeing he slayeth but the leathern bottle , and spilleth not the wine of life upon the earth .
Parsing [sent. 6283 len. 2]: Alas !
Parsing [sent. 6284 len. 2]: alas !
Parsing [sent. 6285 len. 6]: for I can not die !
Parsing [sent. 6286 len. 21]: And with that a finger twitched , and I shouted aloud for joy : I was yet in the body !
Parsing [sent. 6287 len. 31]: And I sprang to my feet jubilant , and , lame and bruised and broken-armed , tottered away after Death , who yet might hold the secret of eternal repose .
Parsing [sent. 6288 len. 17]: I was alive , but yet there was hope , for Death was yet before me !
Parsing [sent. 6289 len. 29]: I was alive , but I had not died , and who could tell but I might yet find the lovely night that hath neither clouds nor stars !
Parsing [sent. 6290 len. 16]: I had not passed into the land of the dead and found myself yet living !
Parsing [sent. 6291 len. 17]: The wise men of my nation in the city of the Almains might yet be wise !
Parsing [sent. 6292 len. 14]: And for an hour I rejoiced , and was glad greatly . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 6293 len. 3]: CHAPTER XII .
Parsing [sent. 6294 len. 4]: THE WANDERING JEW .
Parsing [sent. 6295 len. 10]: `` It was midnight , and sultry as hell .
Parsing [sent. 6296 len. 8]: All day not a breath had stirred .
Parsing [sent. 6297 len. 18]: The country through which I passed was level as the sea that had once flowed above it .
Parsing [sent. 6298 len. 29]: My heart had almost ceased to beat , and I was weary as the man who is too weary to sleep outright , and labours in his dreams .
Parsing [sent. 6299 len. 7]: I slumbered and yet walked on .
Parsing [sent. 6300 len. 20]: My blood flowed scarce faster than the sluggish water in the many canals I crossed on my weary way .
Parsing [sent. 6301 len. 15]: And ever I thought to meet the shadow that was and was not death .
Parsing [sent. 6302 len. 6]: But this was no dream .
Parsing [sent. 6303 len. 24]: Just on the stroke of midnight , I came to the gate of a large city , and the watchers let me pass .
Parsing [sent. 6304 len. 55]: Through many an ancient and lofty street I wandered , like a ghost in a dream , knowing no one , and caring not for myself , and at length reached an open space where stood a great church , the cross upon whose spire seemed bejewelled with the stars upon which it dwelt .
Parsing [sent. 6305 len. 11]: And in my soul I said , O Lord Jesus !
Parsing [sent. 6306 len. 20]: and went up to the base of the tower , and found the door thereof open to my hand .
Parsing [sent. 6307 len. 17]: Then with my staff I ascended the winding stairs , until I reached the open sky .
Parsing [sent. 6308 len. 16]: And the stairs went still winding , on and on , up towards the stars .
Parsing [sent. 6309 len. 26]: And with my staff I ascended , and arose into the sky , until I stood at the foot of the cross of stone . ''
Parsing [sent. 6310 len. 4]: ` Ay me !
Parsing [sent. 6311 len. 23]: how the centuries without haste , without rest , had glided along since I stood by the cross of dishonour and pain !
Parsing [sent. 6312 len. 36]: And God had not grown weary of his life yet , but I had grown so weary in my very bones that weariness was my element , and I had ceased almost to note it .
Parsing [sent. 6313 len. 20]: And now , high-uplifted in honour and worship over every populous city , stood the cross among the stars !
Parsing [sent. 6314 len. 43]: I scrambled up the pinnacles , and up on the carven stem of the cross , for my sinews were as steel , and my muscles had dried and hardened until they were as those of the tiger or the great serpent .
Parsing [sent. 6315 len. 53]: So I climbed , and lifted up myself until I reached the great arms of the cross , and over them I flung my arms , as was my wont , and entwined the stem with my legs , and there hung , three hundred feet above the roofs of the houses .
Parsing [sent. 6316 len. 23]: And as I hung the moon rose and cast the shadow of me Ahasuerus upon the cross , up against the Pleiades .
Parsing [sent. 6317 len. 35]: And as if dull Nature were offended thereat , nor understood the offering of my poor sacrifice , the clouds began to gather , like the vultures -- no one could have told whence .
Parsing [sent. 6318 len. 27]: From all sides around they rose , and the moon was blotted out , and they gathered and rose until they met right over the cross .
Parsing [sent. 6319 len. 53]: And when they closed , then the lightning brake forth , and the thunder with it , and it flashed and thundered above and around and beneath me , so that I could not tell which voice belonged to which arrow , for all were mingled in one great confusion and uproar .
Parsing [sent. 6320 len. 85]: And the people in the houses below heard the sound of the thunder , and they looked from their windows , and they saw the storm raving and flashing about the spire , which stood the heart of the agony , and they saw something hang there , even upon its cross , in the form of a man , and they came from their houses , and the whole space beneath was filled with people , who stood gazing up at the marvel .
Parsing [sent. 6321 len. 3]: A MIRACLE !
Parsing [sent. 6322 len. 3]: A MIRACLE !
Parsing [sent. 6323 len. 27]: they cried ; and truly it was no miracle -- it was only me Ahasuerus , the wanderer taking thought concerning his crime against the crucified .
Parsing [sent. 6324 len. 49]: Then came a great light all about me , such light for shining as I had never before beheld , and indeed I saw it not all with my eyes , but the greater part with my soul , which surely is the light of the eyes themselves .
Parsing [sent. 6325 len. 43]: And I said to myself , Doubtless the Lord is at hand , and he cometh to me as late to the blessed Saul of Tarsus , who was NOT the chief of sinners , but I -- Ahasuerus , the accursed .
Parsing [sent. 6326 len. 78]: And the thunder burst like the bursting of a world in the furnace of the sun ; and whether it was that the lightning struck me , or that I dropped , as was my custom , outwearied from the cross , I know not , but thereafter I lay at its foot among the pinnacles , and when the people looked again , the miracle was over , and they returned to their houses and slept .
Parsing [sent. 6327 len. 57]: And the next day , when I sought the comfort of the bath , I found upon my side the figure of a cross , and the form of a man hanging thereupon as I had hung , depainted in a dark colour as of lead plain upon the flesh of my side over my heart .
Parsing [sent. 6328 len. 6]: Here was a miracle indeed !
Parsing [sent. 6329 len. 14]: but verily I knew not whether therefrom to gather comfort or despair . ''
Parsing [sent. 6330 len. 29]: ` And it was night as I went into a village among the mountains , through the desert places of which I had all that day been wandering .
Parsing [sent. 6331 len. 12]: And never before had my condition seemed to me so hopeless .
Parsing [sent. 6332 len. 66]: There was not one left upon the earth who had ever seen me knowing me , and although there went a tale of such a man as I , yet faith had so far vanished from the earth that for a thing to be marvellous , however just , was sufficient reason wherefore no man , to be counted wise , should believe the same .
Parsing [sent. 6333 len. 16]: For the last fifty years I had found not one that would receive my testimony .
Parsing [sent. 6334 len. 88]: For when I told them the truth concerning myself , saying as I now say , and knowing the thing for true -- that I was Ahasuerus whom the Word had banished from his home in the regions governed of Death , shutting against him the door of the tomb that he should not go in , every man said I was mad , and would hold with me no manner of communication , more than if I had been possessed with a legion of swine-loving demons .
Parsing [sent. 6335 len. 17]: Therefore was I cold at heart , and lonely to the very root of my being .
Parsing [sent. 6336 len. 17]: And thus it was with me that midnight as I entered the village among the mountains .
Parsing [sent. 6337 len. 20]: -- Now all therein slept , so even that not a dog barked at the sound of my footsteps .
Parsing [sent. 6338 len. 65]: But suddenly , and my soul yet quivers with dismay at the remembrance , a yell of horror tore its way from the throat of every sleeper at once , and shot into every cranny of the many-folded mountains , that my soul knocked shaking against the sides of my body , and I also shrieked aloud with the keen terror of the cry .
Parsing [sent. 6339 len. 25]: For surely there was no sleeper there , man , woman , or child , who yelled not aloud in an agony of fear .
Parsing [sent. 6340 len. 45]: And I knew that it could only be because of the unseen presence in their street of the outcast , the homeless , the loveless , the wanderer for ever , who had refused a stone to his maker whereon to rest his cross .
Parsing [sent. 6341 len. 12]: Truly I know not whence else could have come that cry .
Parsing [sent. 6342 len. 29]: And I looked to see that all the inhabitants of the village should rush out upon me , and go for to slay the unslayable in their agony .
Parsing [sent. 6343 len. 14]: But the cry passed , and after the cry came again the stillness .
Parsing [sent. 6344 len. 47]: And for very dread lest yet another such cry should enter my ears , and turn my heart to a jelly , I did hasten my steps to leave the dwellings of the children of the world , and pass out upon the pathless hills again .
Parsing [sent. 6345 len. 28]: But as I turned and would have departed , the door of a house opened over against where I stood ; and as it opened , lo !
Parsing [sent. 6346 len. 32]: a sharp gust of wind from the mountains swept along the street , and out into the wind came running a girl , clothed only in the garment of the night .
Parsing [sent. 6347 len. 50]: And the wind blew upon her , and by the light of the moon I saw that her hands and her feet were rough and brown , as of one that knew labour and hardship , but yet her body was dainty and fair , and moulded in loveliness .
Parsing [sent. 6348 len. 65]: Her hair blew around her like a rain cloud , so that it almost blinded her , and truly she had much ado to clear it from her face , as a half-drowned man would clear from his face the waters whence he hath been lifted ; and like two stars of light from amidst the cloud gazed forth the eyes of the girl .
Parsing [sent. 6349 len. 27]: And she looked upon me with the courage of a child , and she said unto me , Stranger , knowest thou wherefore was that cry ?
Parsing [sent. 6350 len. 14]: Was it thou who did so cry in our street in the night ?
Parsing [sent. 6351 len. 28]: And I answered her and said , Verily not I , maiden , but I too heard the cry , and it shook my soul within me .
Parsing [sent. 6352 len. 27]: -- What seemed it unto thee like , she asked , for truly I slept , and know only the terror thereof and not the sound ?
Parsing [sent. 6353 len. 24]: And I said , It seemed unto me that every soul in the village cried out at once in some dream of horror .
Parsing [sent. 6354 len. 29]: -- I cried not out , she said ; for I slept and dreamed , and my dream was such that I know verily I cried not out .
Parsing [sent. 6355 len. 9]: And the maiden was lovely in her innocence .
Parsing [sent. 6356 len. 28]: And I said : And was thy dream such , maiden , that thou wouldst not refuse but wouldst tell it to an old man like me ?
Parsing [sent. 6357 len. 54]: And with that the wind came down from the mountain like a torrent of wolves , and it laid hold upon me and swept me from the village , and I fled before it , and could not stay my steps until I got me into the covert of a hollow rock . ''
Parsing [sent. 6358 len. 12]: ` And scarce had I turned in thither when , lo !
Parsing [sent. 6359 len. 19]: thither came the maiden also , flying in my footsteps , and driven of the self-same mighty wind .
Parsing [sent. 6360 len. 14]: And I turned in pity and said , Fear not , my child .
Parsing [sent. 6361 len. 20]: Here is but an old man with a sore and withered heart , and he will not harm thee .
Parsing [sent. 6362 len. 17]: -- I fear thee not , she answered , else would I not have followed thee .
Parsing [sent. 6363 len. 34]: -- Thou didst not follow me of thine own inclining , I said , but the wind that came from the mountains and swept me before it , did bear thee after me .
Parsing [sent. 6364 len. 21]: -- Truly I know of no wind , she said , but the wind of my own following of thee .
Parsing [sent. 6365 len. 7]: Wherefore didst thou flee from me ?
Parsing [sent. 6366 len. 3]: -- Nay !
Parsing [sent. 6367 len. 9]: but wherefore didst thou follow me , maiden ?
Parsing [sent. 6368 len. 17]: -- That I might tell thee my dream to the which thou didst desire to hearken .
Parsing [sent. 6369 len. 4]: For , lo !
Parsing [sent. 6370 len. 52]: as I slept I dreamed that a man came unto me and said , Behold , I am the unresting and undying one , and my burden is greater than I can bear , for Death who befriendeth all is my enemy , and will not look upon me in peace .
Parsing [sent. 6371 len. 29]: And with that came the cry , and I awoke , and ran out to see whence came the cry , and found thee alone in the street .
Parsing [sent. 6372 len. 22]: And as God liveth , such as was the man in my dream , such art thou in my waking sight .
Parsing [sent. 6373 len. 19]: -- Not the less must I ask thee again , I said , wherefore didst thou follow me ?
Parsing [sent. 6374 len. 10]: -- That I may comfort thee , she answered .
Parsing [sent. 6375 len. 13]: -- And how thinkest thou to comfort one whom God hath forsaken ?
Parsing [sent. 6376 len. 32]: -- That can not be , she said , seeing that in a vision of the night he sent thee unto me , and so now hath sent me unto thee .
Parsing [sent. 6377 len. 12]: Therefore will I go with thee , and minister unto thee .
Parsing [sent. 6378 len. 35]: -- Bethink thee well what thou doest , I said ; and before thou art fully resolved , sit thee down by me in this cave , that I may tell thee my tale .
Parsing [sent. 6379 len. 12]: And straightway she sat down , and I told her all .
Parsing [sent. 6380 len. 10]: And ere I had finished the sun had risen .
Parsing [sent. 6381 len. 19]: -- Then art thou now alone , said the maiden , and hast no one to love thee ?
Parsing [sent. 6382 len. 14]: -- No one , I answered , man , woman , or child .
Parsing [sent. 6383 len. 49]: -- Then will I go with thee , for I know neither father nor mother , and no one hath power over me , for I keep goats on the mountains for wages , and if thou wilt but give me bread to eat I will serve thee .
Parsing [sent. 6384 len. 12]: And a great love arose in my heart to the maiden .
Parsing [sent. 6385 len. 23]: And I left her in the cave , and went to the nearest city , and returned thence with garments and victuals .
Parsing [sent. 6386 len. 7]: And I loved the maiden greatly .
Parsing [sent. 6387 len. 48]: And although my age was then marvellous being over and above a thousand and seven hundred years , yet found she my person neither pitiful nor uncomely , for I was still in body even such as when the Lord Jesus spake the word of my doom .
Parsing [sent. 6388 len. 10]: And the damsel loved me , and was mine .
Parsing [sent. 6389 len. 10]: And she was as the apple of mine eye .
Parsing [sent. 6390 len. 21]: And the world was no more unto me as a desert , but it blossomed as the rose of Sharon .
Parsing [sent. 6391 len. 43]: And although I knew every city upon it , and every highway and navigable sea , yet did all become to me fresh and new because of the joy which the damsel had in beholding its kingdoms and the glories thereof . ''
Parsing [sent. 6392 len. 96]: ` And it came to pass that my heart grew proud within me , and I said to myself that I was all-superior to other men , for Death could not touch me ; that I was a marvel upon the face of the world ; and in this yet more above all men that had ever lived , that at such an age as mine I could yet gain the love , yea , the absolute devotion , of such an one as my wife , who never wearied of my company and conversation .
Parsing [sent. 6393 len. 37]: So I took to me even the free grace of love as my merit unto pride , and laid it not to the great gift of God and the tenderness of the heart of my beloved .
Parsing [sent. 6394 len. 39]: Like Satan in Heaven I was uplifted in the strength and worthiness and honour of my demon-self , and my pride went not forth in thanks , for I gloried not in my God , but in Ahasuerus .
Parsing [sent. 6395 len. 38]: Then the thought smote me like an arrow of lightning : She will die , and thou shalt live -- live -- live -- and as he hath delayed , so will he yet delay his coming .
Parsing [sent. 6396 len. 13]: And as Satan from the seventh heaven , I fell prone . ''
Parsing [sent. 6397 len. 17]: ` Then my spirit began again to revive within me , and I said , Lo !
Parsing [sent. 6398 len. 58]: I have yet many years of her love ere she dieth , and when she is gone , I shall yet have the memory of my beloved to be with me , and cheer me , and bear me up , for I may never again despise that which she hath loved as she hath loved me .
Parsing [sent. 6399 len. 51]: And yet again a thought smote me , and it was as an arrow of the lightning , and its barb was the truth : But she will grow old , it said , and will wither before thy face , and be as the waning moon in the heavens .
Parsing [sent. 6400 len. 9]: And my heart cried out in an agony .
Parsing [sent. 6401 len. 35]: But my will sought to comfort my heart , and said , Cry not out , for , in spite of old age as in spite of death , I will love her still .
Parsing [sent. 6402 len. 156]: Then something began to writhe within me , and to hiss out words that gathered themselves unto this purpose : But she will grow unlovely , and wrinkled , and dark of hue , and the shape of her body will vanish , and her form be unformed , and her eyes will grow small and dim , and creep back into her head , and her hair will fall from her , and she shall be as the unsightly figure of Death with a skin drawn over his unseemly bones ; and the damsel of thy love , with the round limbs and the flying hair , and the clear eyes out of which looketh a soul clear as they , will be nowhere -- nowhere , for evermore , for thou wilt not be able to believe that she it is who standeth before thee : how will it be with thee then ?
Parsing [sent. 6403 len. 19]: And what mercy is his who hath sent thee a growing loss in the company of this woman ?
Parsing [sent. 6404 len. 13]: Thereupon I rose in the strength of my agony and went forth .
Parsing [sent. 6405 len. 40]: And I said nothing unto my wife , but strode to the foot of the great mountain , whose entrails were all aglow , and on whose sides grew the palm and the tree-bread and the nut of milk .
Parsing [sent. 6406 len. 18]: And I climbed the mountain , nor once looked behind me , but climbed to the top .
Parsing [sent. 6407 len. 13]: And there for one moment I stood in the stock-dullness of despair .
Parsing [sent. 6408 len. 29]: And beneath me was the great fiery gulf , outstretched like a red lake skinned over with black ice , through the cracks wherein shone the blinding fire .
Parsing [sent. 6409 len. 49]: Every moment here and there a great liquid bubbling would break through the crust , and make a wallowing heap upon the flat , then sink again , leaving an open red well-pool of fire whence the rays shot up like flame , although flame there was none .
Parsing [sent. 6410 len. 21]: It lay like the back of some huge animal upheaved out of hell , which was wounded and bled fire .
Parsing [sent. 6411 len. 72]: -- Now , in the last year of my long sojourn , life had again , because of the woman that loved me , become precious unto me , and more than once had I laughed as I caught myself starting back from some danger in a crowded street , for the thing was new to me , so utterly had the care of my life fallen into disuse with me .
Parsing [sent. 6412 len. 66]: But now again in my misery I thought no more of danger , but went stalking and sliding down the sindery slope of the huge fire-cup , and out upon the lake of molten earth -- molten as when first it shot from the womb of the sun , of whose ardour , through all the millions of years , it had not yet cooled .
Parsing [sent. 6413 len. 33]: And as once St. Peter on the stormy water to find the Lord of Life , so walked I on the still lake of fire , caring neither for life nor death .
Parsing [sent. 6414 len. 44]: For my heart was withered to the roots by the thought of the decay of her whom I had loved ; for would not then her very presence every hour be causing me to forget the beauty that had once made me glad ?
Parsing [sent. 6415 len. 57]: -- I had walked some ten furlongs , and passed the middle of the lake , when suddenly I bethought me that she would marvel whither I had gone , and set out to seek me , and something might befall her , and I should lose my rose ere its leaves had begun to drop .
Parsing [sent. 6416 len. 22]: And I turned and strode again in haste across the floor of black heat , broken and seamed with red light .
Parsing [sent. 6417 len. 3]: And lo !
Parsing [sent. 6418 len. 41]: as I neared the midst of the lake , a form came towards me , walking in the very footsteps I had left behind me , nor had I to look again to know the gracious motion of my beloved .
Parsing [sent. 6419 len. 42]: And the black ice broke at her foot , and the fire shone up on her face , and it was lovely as an angel of God , and the glow of her love outshone the glow of the nether fire .
Parsing [sent. 6420 len. 39]: And I called not to stay her foot , for I judged that the sooner she was with me , the sooner would she be in safety , for I knew how to walk thereon better than she .
Parsing [sent. 6421 len. 102]: And my heart sang a song within me in praise of the love of woman , but I thought only of the love of my woman to me , whom the fires of hell could not hold back from him who was worthy of her love ; and my heart sent the song up to my lips ; but , as the first word arose , sure itself a red bubble from the pit of glowing hell , the black crust burst up between us , and a great hillock of seething , slow-spouting , slow-falling , mad red fire arose .
Parsing [sent. 6422 len. 22]: For a moment or two the molten mound bubbled and wallowed , then sank -- and I saw not my wife .
Parsing [sent. 6423 len. 48]: Headlong I plunged into the fiery pool at my feet , and the clinging torture hurt me not , and I caught her in my arms , and rose to the surface , and crept forth , and shook the fire from mine eyes , and lo !
Parsing [sent. 6424 len. 16]: I held to my bosom but as the fragment of a cinder of the furnace .
Parsing [sent. 6425 len. 20]: And I laughed aloud in my madness , and the devils below heard me , and laughed yet again .
Parsing [sent. 6426 len. 3]: O Age !
Parsing [sent. 6427 len. 3]: O Decay !
Parsing [sent. 6428 len. 17]: I cried , see how I triumph over thee : what canst thou do to this ?
Parsing [sent. 6429 len. 19]: And I flung the cinder from me into the pool , and plunged again into the grinning fire .
Parsing [sent. 6430 len. 41]: But it cast me out seven times , and the seventh time I turned from it , and rushed out of the valley of burning , and threw myself on the mountain-side in the moonlight , and awoke mad . ''
Parsing [sent. 6431 len. 17]: ` And what I had then said in despair , I said yet again in thankfulness .
Parsing [sent. 6432 len. 3]: O Age !
Parsing [sent. 6433 len. 3]: O Decay !
Parsing [sent. 6434 len. 24]: I cried , what canst thou now do to destroy the image of her which I bear nested in my heart of hearts ?
Parsing [sent. 6435 len. 10]: That at least is safe , I thank God .
Parsing [sent. 6436 len. 21]: And from that hour I never more believed that I should die when at length my body dropped from me .
Parsing [sent. 6437 len. 29]: If the thought came , it came as a fear , and not as a thing concerning which a man may say I would or I would not .
Parsing [sent. 6438 len. 52]: For a mighty hope had arisen within me that yet I should stand forgiven in the eyes of him that was crucified , and that in token of his forgiveness he would grant me to look again , but in peace , upon the face of her that had loved me .
Parsing [sent. 6439 len. 29]: O mighty Love , who can tell to what heights of perfection thou mayest yet rise in the bosom of the meanest who followeth the Crucified ! ' ''
Parsing [sent. 6440 len. 3]: CHAPTER XIII .
Parsing [sent. 6441 len. 2]: REMARKS .
Parsing [sent. 6442 len. 13]: Polwarth closed the manuscript , and for a time no one spoke .
Parsing [sent. 6443 len. 25]: `` The man who wrote that book , '' said Wingfold , `` could not have been all out of his right mind . ''
Parsing [sent. 6444 len. 29]: `` I must confess to you , '' returned Polwarth , `` that I have chosen some of the more striking passages -- only some of them however .
Parsing [sent. 6445 len. 37]: One thing is pretty clear -- that , granted the imagined conditions , within that circle the writer is sane enough -- as sane at least as the Wandering Jew himself could well have been . ''
Parsing [sent. 6446 len. 13]: `` Could you trust me with the manuscript , Mr. Polwarth ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6447 len. 4]: said the curate .
Parsing [sent. 6448 len. 12]: `` Willingly , '' said Polwarth , handing it to him .
Parsing [sent. 6449 len. 11]: `` And I may carry it home with me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6450 len. 4]: `` Certainly . ''
Parsing [sent. 6451 len. 10]: `` I shall take right good care of it .
Parsing [sent. 6452 len. 11]: Are there any further memorials of struggle with unbelief ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6453 len. 24]: `` Yes , there are some ; for mood and not conviction must , in such a mind , often rule the hour .
Parsing [sent. 6454 len. 25]: Sometimes he can believe ; sometimes he can not : he is a great man indeed who can always rise above his own moods !
Parsing [sent. 6455 len. 22]: There is one passage I specially remember in which after his own fashion he treats of the existence of a God .
Parsing [sent. 6456 len. 14]: You will know the one I mean when you come to it . ''
Parsing [sent. 6457 len. 8]: `` It is indeed a treasure ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6458 len. 14]: said the curate , taking the book and regarding it with prizing eyes .
Parsing [sent. 6459 len. 11]: In his heart he was thinking of Leopold and Helen .
Parsing [sent. 6460 len. 20]: And while he thus regarded the book , he was himself regarded of the gray luminous eyes of Rachel .
Parsing [sent. 6461 len. 80]: What shone from those eyes may have been her delight at hearing him so speak of the book , for the hand that wrote it was that of her father ; but there was a lingering in her gaze , not unmixed with questioning , and a certain indescribable liquidity in its light , reminding one of the stars as seen through a clear air from which the dew settles thick , that might have made a mother anxious .
Parsing [sent. 6462 len. 22]: Alas for many a woman whose outward form is ungainly -- she has a full round heart under the twisted ribs !
Parsing [sent. 6463 len. 7]: Why then should I say alas ?
Parsing [sent. 6464 len. 11]: Were it better that the heart were like the shape ?
Parsing [sent. 6465 len. 13]: or are such as Rachel forgotten before the God of the sparrows ?
Parsing [sent. 6466 len. 121]: No , surely ; but he who most distinctly believes that from before the face of God every sorrow shall vanish , that they that sow in tears shall reap in joy , that death is but a mist that for a season swathes the spirit , and that , ever as the self-seeking vanishes from love , it groweth more full of delight -- even he who with all his heart believes this , may be mournful over the aching of another heart while yet it lasts ; and he who looks for his own death as his resurrection , may yet be sorrowful at every pale sunset that reminds him of the departure of the beloved before him .
Parsing [sent. 6467 len. 44]: The curate rose and took his departure , but the light of the gaze that had rested upon him lingered yet on the countenance of Rachel , and a sad half-smile hung over the motions of the baby-like fingers that knitted so busily .
Parsing [sent. 6468 len. 26]: The draper followed the curate , and Polwarth went up to his own room : he never could keep off his knees for long together .
Parsing [sent. 6469 len. 29]: And as soon as she was alone , Rachel 's hands dropped on her lap , her eyes closed , and her lips moved with solemn sweet motions .
Parsing [sent. 6470 len. 19]: If there was a hearing ear open to that little house , oh surely those two were blessed !
Parsing [sent. 6471 len. 29]: If not , then kind death was yet for a certainty drawing nigh -- only , what if in deep hell there should be yet a deeper hell ?
Parsing [sent. 6472 len. 26]: And until slow Death arrive , what loving heart can bear the load that stupid Chance or still more stupid Fate has heaped upon it ?
Parsing [sent. 6473 len. 38]: Yet had I rather be crushed beneath the weight of mine , and die with my friends in the moaning of eternal farewells , than live like George Bascombe to carry lightly his little bag of content .
Parsing [sent. 6474 len. 38]: A cursed confusion indeed is the universe , if it be no creation , but the helpless unhelpable thing such men would have us believe it -- the hotbed mother of the children of an iron Necessity .
Parsing [sent. 6475 len. 22]: Can any damnation be worse than this damning into an existence from which there is no refuge but a doubtful death ?
Parsing [sent. 6476 len. 11]: Drew overtook Wingfold , and they walked together into Glaston .
Parsing [sent. 6477 len. 7]: `` Was n't that splendid ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6478 len. 4]: said the draper .
Parsing [sent. 6479 len. 17]: `` Hath not God chosen the weak things of the world to confound the mighty ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6480 len. 4]: returned the curate .
Parsing [sent. 6481 len. 20]: `` Even through the play of a mad-man 's imagination , the spirit of a sound mind may speak .
Parsing [sent. 6482 len. 17]: Did you not find in it some stuff that would shape into answers to your questions ?
Parsing [sent. 6483 len. 66]: `` I ought to have done so , I dare say , '' answered the draper , `` but to tell the truth , I was so taken up with the wild story , and the style of the thing , and the little man 's way of reading it , that I never thought of what I was full of when I came . ''
Parsing [sent. 6484 len. 12]: They parted at the shop , and the curate went on .
Parsing [sent. 6485 len. 3]: CHAPTER XIV .
Parsing [sent. 6486 len. 2]: STRUGGLES .
Parsing [sent. 6487 len. 21]: He stopped at the Manor House , for it was only beginning to be late , to inquire after Leopold .
Parsing [sent. 6488 len. 56]: Helen received him with her usual coldness -- a manner which was in part assumed for self-protection , for in his presence she always felt rebuked , and which had the effect of a veil between them to hide from her much of the curate 's character that might otherwise have been intelligible to her .
Parsing [sent. 6489 len. 30]: Leopold , she said , was a little better , but Wingfold walked home thinking what a happy thing it would be if God were to take him away .
Parsing [sent. 6490 len. 8]: His interest in Helen deepened and deepened .
Parsing [sent. 6491 len. 38]: He could not help admiring her strength of character even when he saw it spent for worse than nought ; and her devotion to her brother was lovely , notwithstanding the stains of selfishness that spotted it .
Parsing [sent. 6492 len. 22]: Her moral standard was indeed far from lofty , and as to her spiritual nature , that as yet appeared nowhere .
Parsing [sent. 6493 len. 21]: And yet the growth in her was marvellous when he thought of what she had seemed before this trouble came .
Parsing [sent. 6494 len. 20]: One evening as he left Leopold , he heard her singing , and stood on the stair to listen .
Parsing [sent. 6495 len. 7]: And to listen was to marvel .
Parsing [sent. 6496 len. 36]: For her voice , instead of being hard and dry , as when he heard it before , was , without any loss of elasticity , now liquid and mellifluous , and full of feeling .
Parsing [sent. 6497 len. 18]: Its tones were borne along like the leaves on the wild west wind of Shelley 's sonnet .
Parsing [sent. 6498 len. 22]: And the longing of the curate to help her from that moment took a fresh departure , and grew and grew .
Parsing [sent. 6499 len. 65]: But as the hours and days and weeks passed , and the longing found no outlet , it turned to an almost hopeless brooding upon the face and the form , yea the heart and soul of the woman he so fain would help , until ere long he loved her with the passion of a man mingled with the compassion of a prophet .
Parsing [sent. 6500 len. 72]: He saw that something had to be done IN her -- perhaps that some saving shock in the guise of ruin had to visit her ; that some door had to be burst open , some roof blown away , some rock blasted , that light and air might have free course through her soul 's house , without which that soul could never grow stately like the house it inhabited .
Parsing [sent. 6501 len. 55]: Whatever might be destined to effect this , for the chance of rendering poorest and most servile aid , he would watch and did watch , in silence and self-restraint , lest he should be betrayed into any presumptuous word that might breathe frost instead of balm upon the buds of her delaying Spring .
Parsing [sent. 6502 len. 17]: If he might but be allowed to minister when at length the sleeping soul should stir !
Parsing [sent. 6503 len. 7]: If its waking glance -- ah !
Parsing [sent. 6504 len. 7]: if it might fall on him !
Parsing [sent. 6505 len. 22]: As often as the thought intruded , his heart would give one delirious bound , then couch ashamed of its presumption .
Parsing [sent. 6506 len. 12]: He would not , he dared not look in that direction .
Parsing [sent. 6507 len. 22]: He accused himself of mingling earthly motives and feelings with the unselfish and true , and scorned himself because of it .
Parsing [sent. 6508 len. 12]: And was not Bascombe already the favoured friend of her heart ?
Parsing [sent. 6509 len. 9]: Yet how could it be of her heart ?
Parsing [sent. 6510 len. 10]: for what concern had hearts in a common unbelief ?
Parsing [sent. 6511 len. 85]: None ; but there were the hearts -- the man and the woman -- notwithstanding , who might yet well be drawn together by the unknown divine which they also shared ; and that Helen , whose foot seemed now to approach and now to shun the line betwixt the kingdom of this world and the kingdom of heaven , should retire with such a guide into the deserts of denial and chosen godlessness , was to Wingfold a thought of torture almost unendurable .
Parsing [sent. 6512 len. 19]: The thought of its possibility , nay , probability -- for were not such unfitnesses continually becoming facts ?
Parsing [sent. 6513 len. 30]: -- threatened sometimes to upset the whole fabric of his faith , although reared in spite of theology , adverse philosophy , and the most honest and bewildering doubt .
Parsing [sent. 6514 len. 29]: That such a thing should be possible seemed at those times to bear more against the existence of a God than all the other grounds of question together .
Parsing [sent. 6515 len. 58]: Then a shudder would go to the very deeps of his heart , and he would lay himself silent before the presence for a time ; or make haste into the solitudes -- not where the sun shone and the water ran , but where the light was dim and the wind low in the pine woods .
Parsing [sent. 6516 len. 90]: There , where the sombre green vaults were upheld by a hundred slender columns , and the far-receding aisles seemed to lead to the ancestral home of shadows , there , his own soul a shadow of grief and fear among the shades of the gloomy temple , he bowed his heart before the Eternal , gathered together all the might of his being , and groaned forth in deepest effort of a will that struggled to be : `` Thy will be done , and not mine . ''
Parsing [sent. 6517 len. 21]: Then would his spirit again walk erect , and carry its burden as a cross and not as a gravestone .
Parsing [sent. 6518 len. 27]: Sometimes he was sorely perplexed to think how the weakness , as he called it , had begun , and how it had grown upon him .
Parsing [sent. 6519 len. 27]: He could not say it was his doing , and what had he ever been aware of in it against which he ought to have striven ?
Parsing [sent. 6520 len. 43]: Came not the whole thing of his nature , a nature that was not of his design , and was beyond him and his control -- a nature that either sprung from a God , or grew out of an unconscious Fate ?
Parsing [sent. 6521 len. 56]: If from the latter , how was such as he to encounter and reduce to a constrained and self-rejecting reason a Self unreasonable , being an issue of the Unreasoning , which Self was yet greater than he , its vagaries the source of his intensest consciousness and brightest glimpses of the ideal and all-desirable .
Parsing [sent. 6522 len. 51]: If on the other hand it was born of a God , then let that God look to it , for , sure , that which belonged to his nature could not be evil or of small account in the eyes of him who made him in his own image .
Parsing [sent. 6523 len. 3]: But alas !
Parsing [sent. 6524 len. 32]: that image had , no matter how , been so defaced , that the will of the man might even now be setting itself up against the will of the God !
Parsing [sent. 6525 len. 12]: Did his love then spring from the God-will or the man-will ?
Parsing [sent. 6526 len. 16]: Must there not be some God-way of the thing , all right and nothing wrong ?
Parsing [sent. 6527 len. 39]: -- But he could not compass it , and the marvel to himself was that all the time he was able to go on preaching , and that with some sense of honesty and joy in his work .
Parsing [sent. 6528 len. 38]: In this trouble more than ever Wingfold felt that if there was no God , his soul was but a thing of rags and patches out in the masterless pitiless storm and hail of a chaotic universe .
Parsing [sent. 6529 len. 41]: Often would he rush into the dark , as it were , crying for God , and ever he would emerge therefrom with some tincture of the light , enough to keep him alive and send him to his work .
Parsing [sent. 6530 len. 74]: And there , in her own seat , Sunday after Sunday , sat the woman whom he had seen ten times , and that for no hasty moments , during the week , by the bedside of her brother , yet to whom only now , in the open secrecy of the pulpit , did he dare utter the words of might he would so fain have poured direct into her suffering heart .
Parsing [sent. 6531 len. 31]: And there , Sunday after Sunday , the face he loved bore witness to the trouble of the heart he loved yet more : that heart was not yet redeemed !
Parsing [sent. 6532 len. 20]: oh , might it be granted him to set some little wind a blowing for its revival and hope !
Parsing [sent. 6533 len. 65]: As often as he stood up to preach , his heart swelled with the message he bore -- a message of no private interpretation , but for the healing of the nations , yet a message for her , and for the healing of every individual heart that would hear and take , and he spoke with the freedom and dignity of a prophet .
Parsing [sent. 6534 len. 44]: But when he saw her afterwards , he scarcely dared let his eyes rest a moment on her face , would only pluck the flower of a glance flying , or steal it at such moments when he thought she would not see .
Parsing [sent. 6535 len. 23]: She caught his glance however far oftener than he knew , and was sometimes aware of it without seeing it at all .
Parsing [sent. 6536 len. 92]: And there was that in the curate 's behaviour , in his absolute avoidance of self-assertion , or the least possible intrusion upon her mental privacy -- in the wrapping of his garments around him as it were , that his presence might offend as little as might be , while at the same time he was full of simple direct ministration to her brother , without one side-glance that sought approval of her , which the nobility of the woman could not fail to note , and seek to understand .
Parsing [sent. 6537 len. 11]: It was altogether a time of great struggle with Wingfold .
Parsing [sent. 6538 len. 45]: He seemed to be assailed in every direction , and to feel the strong house of life giving way in every part , and yet he held on -- lived , which he thought was all , and , without knowing it , grew .
Parsing [sent. 6539 len. 25]: Perhaps it may be this period that the following verses which I found among his papers belong : he could not himself tell me .
Parsing [sent. 6540 len. 16]: -- Out of my door I run to do the thing That calls upon me .
Parsing [sent. 6541 len. 22]: Straight the wind of words Whoops from mine ears the sounds of them that sing About their work -- My God !
Parsing [sent. 6542 len. 3]: my Father-King .
Parsing [sent. 6543 len. 13]: I turn in haste to see thy blessed door , But lo !
Parsing [sent. 6544 len. 28]: a cloud of flies and bats and birds , And stalking vapours , and vague monster herds , Have risen and lighted , rushed and swollen between .
Parsing [sent. 6545 len. 3]: Ah me !
Parsing [sent. 6546 len. 9]: the house of peace is there no more .
Parsing [sent. 6547 len. 6]: Was it a dream then ?
Parsing [sent. 6548 len. 28]: Walls , fireside , and floor , And sweet obedience , loving , calm , and free , Are vanished -- gone as they had never been .
Parsing [sent. 6549 len. 4]: I labour groaning .
Parsing [sent. 6550 len. 5]: Comes a sudden sheen !
Parsing [sent. 6551 len. 19]: -- And I am kneeling at my Father 's knee , Sighing with joy , and hoping utterly .
Parsing [sent. 6552 len. 3]: CHAPTER XV .
Parsing [sent. 6553 len. 3]: THE LAWN .
Parsing [sent. 6554 len. 11]: Leopold had begun to cough , and the fever continued .
Parsing [sent. 6555 len. 18]: Every afternoon came the red flush to his cheek , and the hard glitter into his eye .
Parsing [sent. 6556 len. 13]: His talk was then excited , and mostly about his coming trial .
Parsing [sent. 6557 len. 22]: To Helen it was terribly painful , and she confessed to herself that but for Wingfold she must have given way .
Parsing [sent. 6558 len. 43]: Leopold insisted on seeing Mr. Hooker every time he called , and every time expressed the hope that he would not allow pity for his weak state to prevent him from applying the severe remedy of the law to his moral condition .
Parsing [sent. 6559 len. 34]: But in truth it began to look doubtful whether disease would not run a race with law for his life , even if the latter should at once proceed to justify a claim .
Parsing [sent. 6560 len. 33]: From the first Faber doubted if he would ever recover from the consequences of that exposure in the churchyard , and it soon became evident that his lungs were more than affected .
Parsing [sent. 6561 len. 15]: His cough increased , and he began to lose what little flesh he had .
Parsing [sent. 6562 len. 27]: One day Faber expressed his conviction to Wingfold that he was fighting the disease at the great disadvantage of having an unknown enemy to contend with .
Parsing [sent. 6563 len. 25]: `` The fellow is unhappy , '' he said , `` and if that lasts another month , I shall throw up the sponge .
Parsing [sent. 6564 len. 26]: He has a good deal of vitality , but it is yielding , and by that time he will be in a galloping consumption . ''
Parsing [sent. 6565 len. 31]: `` You must do your best for him , '' said Wingfold , but in his heart he wished , with an honest affection , that he might not succeed .
Parsing [sent. 6566 len. 32]: Leopold , however , seemed to have no idea of his condition , and the curate wondered what he would think or do were he to learn that he was dying .
Parsing [sent. 6567 len. 14]: Would he insist on completing his confession , and urging on a trial ?
Parsing [sent. 6568 len. 50]: He had himself told him all that had passed with the magistrate , and how things now were as he understood them , but it was plain that he had begun to be uneasy about the affair , and was doubtful at times whether all was as it seemed .
Parsing [sent. 6569 len. 6]: The curate was not deceived .
Parsing [sent. 6570 len. 27]: He had been present during a visit from Mr. Hooker , and nothing could be plainer than the impression out of which the good man spoke .
Parsing [sent. 6571 len. 16]: Nor could he fail to suspect the cunning kindness of George Bascombe in the affair .
Parsing [sent. 6572 len. 15]: But he did not judge that he had now the least call to interfere .
Parsing [sent. 6573 len. 41]: The poor boy had done as much as lay either in or out of him in the direction of duty , and was daily becoming more and more unfit either to originate or carry out a further course of action .
Parsing [sent. 6574 len. 32]: If he was in himself capable of anything more , he was , in his present state of weakness , utterly unable to cope with the will of those around him .
Parsing [sent. 6575 len. 37]: Faber would have had him leave the country for some southern climate , but he would not hear of it , and Helen , knowing to what extremities it might drive him , would not insist .
Parsing [sent. 6576 len. 14]: Nor , indeed , was he now in a condition to be moved .
Parsing [sent. 6577 len. 21]: Also the weather had grown colder , and he was sensitive to atmospheric changes as any creature of the elements .
Parsing [sent. 6578 len. 41]: But after a fortnight , when it was now the middle of the autumn , it grew quite warm again , and he revived and made such progress that he was able to be carried into the garden every day .
Parsing [sent. 6579 len. 24]: There he sat in a chair on the lawn , with his feet on a sheepskin , and a fur cloak about him .
Parsing [sent. 6580 len. 201]: And for all the pain at his heart , for all the misery in which no one could share , for all the pangs of a helpless jealousy , checked only by a gnawing remorse , both of which took refuge in the thought of following through the spheres until he found her , cast himself at her feet , spoke the truth , and became , if he might , her slave for ever , failing which he could but turn and go wandering through the spheres , seeking rest and finding none , save indeed there were some salvation even for him in the bosom of his God -- I say that , somehow , with all this on the brain and in the heart of him , the sunshine was yet pleasant to his eyes , while it stung him to the soul ; the soft breathing of the wind was pleasant to his cheek , while he cursed himself for the pleasure it gave him ; the few flowers that were left looked up at him mournfully and he let them look , nor turned his eyes away , but let the tears gather and flow .
Parsing [sent. 6581 len. 20]: The first agonies of the encounter of life and death were over , and life was slowly wasting away .
Parsing [sent. 6582 len. 11]: Oh what might not a little joy do for him !
Parsing [sent. 6583 len. 21]: But where was the joy to be found that could irradiate such a darkness even for one fair memorial moment ?
Parsing [sent. 6584 len. 11]: One hot noon Wingfold lay beside him on the grass .
Parsing [sent. 6585 len. 24]: Neither had spoken for some time : the curate more and more shrunk from speech to which his heart was not directly moved .
Parsing [sent. 6586 len. 36]: As to what might be in season or out of season , he never would pretend to judge , he said , but even Balaam 's ass knew when he had a call to speak .
Parsing [sent. 6587 len. 16]: He plucked a pale red pimpernel and handed it up over his head to Leopold .
Parsing [sent. 6588 len. 14]: The youth looked at it for a moment , and burst into tears .
Parsing [sent. 6589 len. 5]: The curate rose hastily .
Parsing [sent. 6590 len. 9]: `` It is so heartless of me . ''
Parsing [sent. 6591 len. 16]: said Leopold , `` to take pleasure in such a childish innocence as this ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6592 len. 141]: `` It merely shows , '' said the curate , laying his hand gently on his shoulder , `` that even in these lowly lovelinesses , there is a something that has its root deeper than your pain ; that , all about us , in earth and air , wherever eye or ear can reach , there is a power ever breathing itself forth in signs , now in a daisy , now in a windwaft , a cloud , a sunset ; a power that holds constant and sweetest relation with the dark and silent world within us ; that the same God who is in us , and upon whose tree we are the buds , if not yet the flowers , also is all about us -- inside , the Spirit ; outside , the Word .
Parsing [sent. 6593 len. 47]: And the two are ever trying to meet in us ; and when they meet , then the sign without , and the longing within , become one in light , and the man no more walketh in darkness , but knoweth whither he goeth . ''
Parsing [sent. 6594 len. 14]: As he ended thus , the curate bent over and looked at Leopold .
Parsing [sent. 6595 len. 13]: But the poor boy had not listened to a word he said .
Parsing [sent. 6596 len. 24]: Something in his tone had soothed him , but the moment he ceased , the vein of his grief burst out bleeding afresh .
Parsing [sent. 6597 len. 47]: He clasped his thin hands together , and looked up in an agony of hopeless appeal to the blue sky , now grown paler as in fear of the coming cold , though still the air was warm and sweet , and cried , `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 6598 len. 21]: if God would only be good and unmake me , and let darkness cover the place where once was me !
Parsing [sent. 6599 len. 8]: That would be like a good God !
Parsing [sent. 6600 len. 41]: All I should be sorry for then would be , that there was not enough of me left for a dim flitting Will-o ' - the-wisp of praise , ever singing my thankfulness to him that I was no more .
Parsing [sent. 6601 len. 30]: -- Yet even then my deed would remain , for I dare not ask that she should die outright also -- that would be to heap wrong upon wrong .
Parsing [sent. 6602 len. 7]: What an awful thing being is !
Parsing [sent. 6603 len. 20]: Not even my annihilation could make up for my crime , or rid it out of the universe . ''
Parsing [sent. 6604 len. 6]: `` True , Leopold ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6605 len. 4]: said the curate .
Parsing [sent. 6606 len. 15]: `` Nothing but the burning love of God can rid sin out of anywhere .
Parsing [sent. 6607 len. 19]: But are you not forgetting him who surely knew what he undertook when he would save the world ?
Parsing [sent. 6608 len. 53]: No more than you could have set that sun flaming overhead , with its million-miled billows and its limitless tempests of fire , can you tell what the love of God is , or what it can do for you , if only by enlarging your love with the inrush of itself .
Parsing [sent. 6609 len. 58]: Few have such a cry to raise to the Father as you , such a claim of sin and helplessness to heave up before him , such a joy even to offer to the great Shepherd who can not rest while one sheep strays from his flock , one prodigal haunts the dens of evil and waste .
Parsing [sent. 6610 len. 10]: Cry to him , Leopold , my dear boy .
Parsing [sent. 6611 len. 37]: Cry to him again and yet again , for he himself said that men ought always to pray and not faint , for God did hear and would answer although he might seem long about it .
Parsing [sent. 6612 len. 83]: I think we shall find one day that nobody , not the poet of widest sweep and most daring imagination , not the prophet who soars the highest in his ardour to justify the ways of God to men , not the child when he is most fully possessed of the angel that in heaven always beholds the face of the Father of Jesus , has come or could have come within sight of the majesty of his bestowing upon his children .
Parsing [sent. 6613 len. 45]: For did he not , if the story be true , allow torture itself to invade the very soul 's citadel of his best beloved , as he went to seek the poor ape of a prodigal , stupidly grinning amongst his harlots ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6614 len. 45]: Leopold did not answer , and the shadow lay deep on his face for a while ; but at length it began to thin , and at last a feeble quivering smile broke through the cloud , and he wept soft tears of refreshing .
Parsing [sent. 6615 len. 52]: It was not that the youth had turned again from the hope of rest in the Son of Man ; but that , as everyone knows who knows anything of the human spirit , there must be in its history days and seasons , mornings and nights , yea deepest midnights .
Parsing [sent. 6616 len. 45]: It has its alternating summer and winter , its storm and shine , its soft dews and its tempests of lashing hail , its cold moons and prophetic stars , its pale twilights of saddest memory , and its golden gleams of brightest hope .
Parsing [sent. 6617 len. 30]: All these mingled and displaced each other in Leopold 's ruined world , where chaos had come again , but over whose waters a mightier breath was now moving .
Parsing [sent. 6618 len. 54]: And now after much thought , the curate saw that he could not hope to transplant into the bosom of the lad the flowers of truth that gladdened his own garden : he must sow the seed from which they had sprung , and that seed was the knowledge of the true Jesus .
Parsing [sent. 6619 len. 39]: It was now the more possible to help him in this way , that the wild beast of his despair had taken its claws from his bosom , had withdrawn a pace or two , and couched watching .
Parsing [sent. 6620 len. 15]: And Wingfold soon found that nothing calmed and brightened him like talk about Jesus .
Parsing [sent. 6621 len. 36]: He had tried verse first -- seeking out the best within his reach wherein loving souls have uttered their devotion to the man of men ; but here also the flowers would not be transplanted .
Parsing [sent. 6622 len. 64]: How it came about he hardly knew , but he had soon drifted into rather than chosen another way , which way proved a right one : he would begin thinking aloud on some part of the gospel story , generally that which was most in his mind at the time -- talking with himself , as it were , all about it .
Parsing [sent. 6623 len. 29]: He began this one morning as he lay on the grass beside him , and that was the position in which he found he could best thus soliloquize .
Parsing [sent. 6624 len. 61]: Now and then but not often Leopold would interrupt him , and perhaps turn the monologue into dialogue , but even then Wingfold would hardly ever look at him : he would not disturb him with more of his presence than he could help , or allow the truth to be flavoured with more of his individuality than was unavoidable .
Parsing [sent. 6625 len. 36]: For every individuality , he argued , has a peculiar flavour to every other , and only Jesus is the pure simple humanity that every one can love , out and out , at once .
Parsing [sent. 6626 len. 59]: In these mental meanderings , he avoided nothing , took notice of every difficulty , whether able to discuss it fully or not , broke out in words of delight when his spirit was moved , nor hid his disappointment when he failed in getting at what might seem good enough to be the heart of the thing .
Parsing [sent. 6627 len. 15]: It was like hatching a sermon in the sun instead of in the oven .
Parsing [sent. 6628 len. 36]: Occasionally , when , having ceased , he looked up to know how his pupil fared , he found him fast asleep -- sometimes with a smile , sometimes with a tear on his face .
Parsing [sent. 6629 len. 7]: The sight would satisfy him well .
Parsing [sent. 6630 len. 90]: Calm upon such a tormented sea must be the gift of God ; and the curate would then sometimes fall asleep himself -- to start awake at the first far-off sound of Helen 's dress as it swept a running fire of fairy fog-signals from the half - opened buds of the daisies , and the long heads of the rib-grass , when he would rise and saunter a few paces aside , and she would bend over her brother , to see if he were warm and comfortable .
Parsing [sent. 6631 len. 24]: By this time all the old tenderness of her ministration had returned , nor did she seem any longer jealous of Wingfold 's .
Parsing [sent. 6632 len. 10]: One day she came behind them as they talked .
Parsing [sent. 6633 len. 43]: The grass had been mown that morning , and also she happened to be dressed in her riding - habit and had gathered up the skirt over her arm , so that on this occasion she made no sound of sweet approach .
Parsing [sent. 6634 len. 21]: Wingfold had been uttering one of his rambling monologues -- in which was much without form , but nothing void .
Parsing [sent. 6635 len. 53]: `` I do n't know quite , '' he had been saying , `` what to think about that story of the woman they brought to Jesus in the temple -- I mean how it got into that nook of the gospel of St. John , where it has no right place .
Parsing [sent. 6636 len. 30]: -- They did n't bring her for healing or for the rebuke of her demon , but for condemnation , only they came to the wrong man for that .
Parsing [sent. 6637 len. 47]: They dared not carry out the law of stoning , as they would have liked , I suppose , even if Jesus had condemned her , but perhaps they hoped rather to entrap him who was the friend of sinners into saying something against the law .
Parsing [sent. 6638 len. 33]: -- But what I want is , to know how it got there , -- just there , I mean , betwixt the seventh and eighth chapters of St. John 's Gospel .
Parsing [sent. 6639 len. 28]: There is no doubt of its being an interpolation -- that the twelfth verse , I think it is , ought to join on to the fifty-second .
Parsing [sent. 6640 len. 24]: The Alexandrian manuscript is the only one of the three oldest that has it , and it is the latest of the three .
Parsing [sent. 6641 len. 38]: I did think once , but hastily , that it was our Lord 's text for saying I AM THE LIGHT OF THE WORLD , but it follows quite as well on his offer of living water .
Parsing [sent. 6642 len. 29]: One can easily see how the place would appear a very suitable one to any presumptuous scribe who wished to settle the question of where it should stand .
Parsing [sent. 6643 len. 25]: -- I wonder if St. John told the lovely tale as something he had forgotten , after he had finished dictating all the rest .
Parsing [sent. 6644 len. 55]: Or was it well known to all the evangelists , only no one of them was yet partaker enough of the spirit of him who was the friend of sinners , to dare put it on written record , thinking it hardly a safe story to expose to the quarrying of men 's conclusions ?
Parsing [sent. 6645 len. 15]: But it does n't matter much : the tale must be a true one .
Parsing [sent. 6646 len. 26]: Only -- to think of just this one story , of tenderest righteousness , floating about like a holy waif through the world of letters !
Parsing [sent. 6647 len. 19]: -- a sweet gray dove of promise that can find no rest for the sole of his foot !
Parsing [sent. 6648 len. 12]: Just this one story of all stories a kind of outcast !
Parsing [sent. 6649 len. 11]: and yet as a wanderer , oh , how welcome !
Parsing [sent. 6650 len. 23]: Some manuscripts , I understand , have granted it a sort of outhouse-shelter at the end of the gospel of St. Luke .
Parsing [sent. 6651 len. 28]: But it all matters nothing , so long as we can believe it ; and true it must be , it is so like him all through .
Parsing [sent. 6652 len. 42]: And if it does go wandering as a stray through the gospels , without place of its own , what matters it so long as it can find hearts enough to nestle in , and bring forth its young of comfort !
Parsing [sent. 6653 len. 26]: -- Perhaps the woman herself told it , and , as with the woman of Samaria , some would and some would not believe her .
Parsing [sent. 6654 len. 3]: -- Oh !
Parsing [sent. 6655 len. 7]: the eyes that met upon her !
Parsing [sent. 6656 len. 21]: The fiery hail of scorn from those of the Pharisees -- the light of eternal sunshine from those of Jesus !
Parsing [sent. 6657 len. 53]: -- I was reading the other day , in one of the old Miracle Plays , how each that looked on while Jesus wrote with his finger on the ground , imagined he was writing down his individual sins , and was in terror lest his neighbour should come to know them .
Parsing [sent. 6658 len. 19]: -- And was n't he gentle even with those to whom he was sharper than a two-edged sword !
Parsing [sent. 6659 len. 15]: and oh how gentle to her he would cover from their rudeness and wrong !
Parsing [sent. 6660 len. 5]: LET THE SINLESS THROW !
Parsing [sent. 6661 len. 15]: And the sinners went out , and she followed -- to sin no more .
Parsing [sent. 6662 len. 6]: No reproaches , you see !
Parsing [sent. 6663 len. 8]: No stirring up of the fiery snakes !
Parsing [sent. 6664 len. 7]: Only do n't do it again .
Parsing [sent. 6665 len. 15]: -- I do n't think she did it again : -- do you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6666 len. 14]: It was just here that Helen came and stood behind Leopold 's chair .
Parsing [sent. 6667 len. 12]: The curate lay on the grass , and neither saw her .
Parsing [sent. 6668 len. 3]: CHAPTER XVI .
Parsing [sent. 6669 len. 6]: HOW JESUS SPOKE TO WOMEN .
Parsing [sent. 6670 len. 13]: `` But why was n't he as gentle with good women ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6671 len. 3]: said Leopold .
Parsing [sent. 6672 len. 6]: `` Was n't he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6673 len. 7]: said the curate in some surprise .
Parsing [sent. 6674 len. 16]: `` He said What have I to do with thee to his own mother ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6675 len. 15]: `` A Greek scholar should go to the Greek , '' said the curate .
Parsing [sent. 6676 len. 7]: `` Our English is not perfect .
Parsing [sent. 6677 len. 25]: You see she wanted to make him show off , and he thought how little she knew what he came to the world for .
Parsing [sent. 6678 len. 16]: Her thoughts were so unlike his that he said , What have we in common !
Parsing [sent. 6679 len. 14]: It was a moan of the God-head over the distance of its creature .
Parsing [sent. 6680 len. 17]: Perhaps he thought : How then will you stand the shock when at length it comes ?
Parsing [sent. 6681 len. 44]: But he looked at her as her own son ought to look at every blessed mother , and she read in his eyes no rebuke , for instantly , sure of her desire , she told them to do whatever he said . ''
Parsing [sent. 6682 len. 26]: `` I hope that 's the right way of it , '' said Leopold , `` for I want to trust him out and out .
Parsing [sent. 6683 len. 18]: But what do you make of the story of the poor woman that came about her daughter ?
Parsing [sent. 6684 len. 7]: Was n't he rough to her ?
Parsing [sent. 6685 len. 23]: It always seemed to me such a cruel thing to talk of throwing the meat of the children to the dogs ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6686 len. 19]: `` We can not judge of the word until we know the spirit that gave birth to it .
Parsing [sent. 6687 len. 25]: Let me ask you a question : What would you take for the greatest proof of downright friendship a man could show you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6688 len. 14]: `` That is too hard a question to answer all at once . ''
Parsing [sent. 6689 len. 43]: `` Well , I may be wrong , but the deepest outcome of friendship seems to me , on the part of the superior at least , the permission , or better still , the call , to share in his sufferings .
Parsing [sent. 6690 len. 18]: And in saying that hard word to the poor Gentile , our Lord honoured her thus mightily .
Parsing [sent. 6691 len. 60]: He assumed for the moment the part of the Jew towards the Gentile , that he might , for the sake of all the world of Gentiles and Jews , lay bare to his Jewish followers the manner of spirit they were of , and let them see what a lovely humanity they despised in their pride of election .
Parsing [sent. 6692 len. 14]: He took her to suffer with him for the salvation of the world .
Parsing [sent. 6693 len. 18]: The cloud overshadowed them both , but what words immediately thereafter made a glory in her heart !
Parsing [sent. 6694 len. 25]: He spoke to her as if her very faith had reached an arm into the heavens , and brought therefrom the thing she sought .
Parsing [sent. 6695 len. 20]: -- But I confess , '' the curate went on , `` those two passages have both troubled me .
Parsing [sent. 6696 len. 34]: So I presume will everything that is God 's , until it becomes a strength and a light by revealing its true nature to the heart that has grown capable of understanding it .
Parsing [sent. 6697 len. 19]: The first sign of the coming capacity and the coming joy , is the anxiety and the question .
Parsing [sent. 6698 len. 27]: -- There is another passage , which , although it does not trouble me so much , I can not yet get a right perception of .
Parsing [sent. 6699 len. 21]: When Mary Magdalene took the Master of Death for the gardener -- the gardener of the garden of the tombs !
Parsing [sent. 6700 len. 7]: no great mistake , was it ?
Parsing [sent. 6701 len. 15]: -- it is a lovely thing , that mistaking of Jesus for the gardener !
Parsing [sent. 6702 len. 19]: -- how the holy and the lowly , yea the holy and the common meet on all sides !
Parsing [sent. 6703 len. 47]: Just listen to their morning talk -- the morning of the eternal open world to Jesus , while the shadows of this narrow life still clustered around Mary : -- I can give it you exactly , for I was reading it this very day . ''
Parsing [sent. 6704 len. 7]: ` Woman , why weepest thou ?
Parsing [sent. 6705 len. 6]: Whom seekest thou ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 6706 len. 27]: ` Sir , if thou have borne him hence , tell me where thou hast laid him , and I will take him away . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 6707 len. 5]: ` Mary . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 6708 len. 5]: ` Master ! ' ''
Parsing [sent. 6709 len. 44]: ` Touch me not ; for I am not yet ascended to my Father : but go to my brethren , and say unto them , I ascend unto my Father and your Father ; and to my God and your God . '
Parsing [sent. 6710 len. 11]: `` Why did he say , DO NOT TOUCH ME ?
Parsing [sent. 6711 len. 31]: It could not be that there was any defilement to one in the new body of the resurrection , from contact with one still in the old garments of humanity .
Parsing [sent. 6712 len. 14]: But could it be that there was danger to her in the contact ?
Parsing [sent. 6713 len. 15]: Was there something in the new house from Heaven hurtful to the old tabernacle ?
Parsing [sent. 6714 len. 6]: I can hardly believe it .
Parsing [sent. 6715 len. 5]: Perhaps it might be .
Parsing [sent. 6716 len. 27]: But we must look at the reason the Master gives -- only of all words hard to understand , the little conjunctions are sometimes the hardest .
Parsing [sent. 6717 len. 6]: What can that FOR mean ?
Parsing [sent. 6718 len. 16]: ` Touch me not , FOR I am not yet ascended to my Father . '
Parsing [sent. 6719 len. 36]: Does it mean , ' I must first present myself to my Father ; I must first have His hand laid on this body new-risen from the grave ; I must go home first ? '
Parsing [sent. 6720 len. 20]: The child must kiss his mother first , then his sisters and brothers : was it so with Jesus ?
Parsing [sent. 6721 len. 30]: Was he so glad in his father , that he must carry even the human body he had rescued eternal from the grave , home to show him first ?
Parsing [sent. 6722 len. 27]: There are many difficulties about the interpretation , and even if true , it would still shock every heart whose devotion was less than absolutely child-like .
Parsing [sent. 6723 len. 31]: Was not God WITH him , as close to him as even God could come to his eternal son -- in him -- ONE with him , all the time ?
Parsing [sent. 6724 len. 12]: How could he get nearer to him by going to Heaven ?
Parsing [sent. 6725 len. 18]: What head-quarters , what court of place and circumstance should the Eternal , Immortal , Invisible hold ?
Parsing [sent. 6726 len. 80]: And yet if from him flow time and space , although he can not be subject to them ; if his son could incarnate himself -- cast the living , responsive , elastic , flowing , evanishing circumstance of a human garment around him ; if , as Novalis says , God can become whatever he can create , then may there not be some central home of God , holding relation even to time and space and sense ?
Parsing [sent. 6727 len. 7]: But I am bewildered about it .
Parsing [sent. 6728 len. 26]: -- Jesus stood then in the meeting point of both worlds , or rather in the skirts of the great world that infolds the less .
Parsing [sent. 6729 len. 19]: I am talking like a baby , for my words can not compass or even represent my thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 6730 len. 24]: This world looks to us the natural and simple one , and so it is -- absolutely fitted to our need and education .
Parsing [sent. 6731 len. 56]: But there is that in us which is not at home in this world , which I believe holds secret relations with every star , or perhaps rather , with that in the heart of God whence issued every star , diverse in kind and character as in colour and place and motion and light .
Parsing [sent. 6732 len. 24]: To that in us , this world is so far strange and unnatural and unfitting , and we need a yet homelier home .
Parsing [sent. 6733 len. 17]: Yea , no home at last will do , but the home of God 's heart .
Parsing [sent. 6734 len. 72]: Jesus , I say , was now looking , on one side , into the region of a deeper life , where his people , those that knew their own when they saw him , would one day find themselves tenfold at home ; while , on the other hand , he was looking into the region of their present life , which custom and faithlessness make them afraid to leave .
Parsing [sent. 6735 len. 49]: But we need not fear what the new conditions of life will bring , either for body or heart , for they will be nearer and sweeter to our deeper being , as Jesus is nearer and dearer than any man because he is more human than any .
Parsing [sent. 6736 len. 22]: He is all that we can love or look for , and at the root of that very loving and looking .
Parsing [sent. 6737 len. 15]: -- ` In my Father 's house are many mansions , ' he said .
Parsing [sent. 6738 len. 49]: Matter , time , space , are all God 's , and whatever may become of our philosophies , whatever he does with or in respect of time , place , and what we call matter , his doing must be true in philosophy as well as fact .
Parsing [sent. 6739 len. 6]: But I am wandering . ''
Parsing [sent. 6740 len. 36]: The curate was wandering , but the liberty of wandering was essential to his talking with the kind of freedom and truth he wanted to mediate betwixt his pupil and the lovely things he saw .
Parsing [sent. 6741 len. 16]: `` I wonder where the penitent thief was all the time , '' said Leopold .
Parsing [sent. 6742 len. 9]: `` Yes , that also is a difficulty .
Parsing [sent. 6743 len. 21]: There again come in the bothering time and space , bothering in their relation to heavenly things , I mean .
Parsing [sent. 6744 len. 41]: On the Friday , the penitent thief , as you call him , was to be with Jesus in Paradise ; and now it was Sunday , and Jesus said he had not yet been up to see his Father .
Parsing [sent. 6745 len. 23]: Some would say , I am too literal , too curious ; what can Friday and Sunday have to do with Paradise ?
Parsing [sent. 6746 len. 44]: But words MEAN in both worlds , for they are not two but one -- surely at least when Jesus thinks and speaks of them ; and there can be no wrong in feeling ever so blindly and dully after WHAT they mean .
Parsing [sent. 6747 len. 48]: Such humble questioning can do no harm , even if , in face of the facts , the questions be as far off and SILLY -- in the old sweet meaning of the word -- as those of any infant concerning a world he has not proved .
Parsing [sent. 6748 len. 16]: -- But about Mary Magdalene : He must have said the word TOUCH ME NOT .
Parsing [sent. 6749 len. 7]: That could not have crept in .
Parsing [sent. 6750 len. 27]: It is too hard for an interpolation , I think ; and if no interpolation , it must mean some deep-good thing we do n't understand .
Parsing [sent. 6751 len. 21]: One thing we can make sure of : it was nothing that should hurt her ; for see what follows .
Parsing [sent. 6752 len. 29]: But for that , when he said TOUCH ME NOT , FOR I AM NOT YET ASCENDED TO MY FATHER , she might have thought -- ` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 6753 len. 17]: thou hast thy Father to go to , and thou wilt leave us for him . '
Parsing [sent. 6754 len. 33]: -- BUT , he went on , GO TO MY BRETHREN AND SAY UNTO THEM : I ASCEND UNTO MY FATHER , AND YOUR FATHER ; AND MY GOD AND YOUR GOD .
Parsing [sent. 6755 len. 6]: What more could she want ?
Parsing [sent. 6756 len. 37]: Think : the Father of Jesus , with whom , in all his knowledge and all his suffering , the grand heart was perfectly , exultingly satisfied , -- that Father he calls our Father too .
Parsing [sent. 6757 len. 45]: He shares with his brethren -- of his best , his deepest , his heartiest , most secret delight , and makes it their and his most open joy : he shares his eternal Father with us , his perfect God with his brethren .
Parsing [sent. 6758 len. 56]: And whatever his not having yet ascended to him may mean , we see , with marvel and joy , that what delayed him -- even though , for some reason perfect in tenderness as in truth , he would not be touched -- was love to Mary Magdalene and his mother and his brethren .
Parsing [sent. 6759 len. 12]: He could not go to the Father without comforting them first .
Parsing [sent. 6760 len. 22]: And certainly whatever she took the TOUCH ME NOT to mean or point at , it was nothing that hurt her .
Parsing [sent. 6761 len. 96]: -- It just strikes me -- is it possible he said it in order to turn the overwhelming passion of her joy , which after such a restoration would have clung more than ever to the visible presence , and would be ready to suffer the pains of death yet again when he parted from her -- might it be to turn that torrent into the wider and ever widening channel of joy in his everlasting presence to the innermost being , his communion , heart to heart , with every child of his Father ?
Parsing [sent. 6762 len. 64]: In our poor weakness and narrowness and self-love , even of Jesus the bodily may block out the spiritual nearness , which , however in most moods we may be unable to realise the fact , is and remains a thing unutterably lovelier and better and dearer -- enhancing tenfold what vision of a bodily presence may at some time be granted us .
Parsing [sent. 6763 len. 35]: But how any woman can help casting herself heart and soul at the feet of such a lowly grandeur , such a tender majesty , such a self-dissolving perfection -- I can not imagine .
Parsing [sent. 6764 len. 13]: The truth must be that those who kneel not have not seen .
Parsing [sent. 6765 len. 34]: You do not once read of a woman being against him -- except indeed it was his own mother , when she thought he was going all astray and forgetting his high mission .
Parsing [sent. 6766 len. 47]: The divine love in him towards his Father in heaven and his brethren of men , was ever melting down his conscious individuality in sweetest showers upon individual hearts ; he came down like rain upon the mown grass , like showers that water the earth .
Parsing [sent. 6767 len. 18]: No woman , no man surely ever saw him as he was and did not worship ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6768 len. 17]: Helen turned and glided back into the house , and neither knew she had been there .
Parsing [sent. 6769 len. 3]: CHAPTER XVII .
Parsing [sent. 6770 len. 2]: DELIVERANCE .
Parsing [sent. 6771 len. 59]: All that could be done for Leopold by tenderest sisterly care under the supervision of Mr. Faber , who believed in medicine less than in good nursing , was well supplemented by the brotherly ministrations of Wingfold , who gave all the time he could honestly spare from his ordinary work to soothe and enlighten the suffering youth .
Parsing [sent. 6772 len. 35]: But it became clearer every week that nothing would avail to entice the torn roots of his being to clasp again the soil of the world : he was withering away out of it .
Parsing [sent. 6773 len. 20]: Ere long symptoms appeared which no one could well mistake , and Lingard himself knew that he was dying .
Parsing [sent. 6774 len. 42]: Wingfold had dreaded that his discovery of the fact might reveal that he had imagined some atonement in the public confession he desired to make , and that , when he found it denied him , he would fall into despair .
Parsing [sent. 6775 len. 18]: But he was with him at the moment , and his bearing left no ground for anxiety .
Parsing [sent. 6776 len. 30]: A gleam of gladness from below the horizon of his spirit , shot up , like the aurora of a heavenly morning , over the sky of his countenance .
Parsing [sent. 6777 len. 25]: He glanced at his friend , smiled , and said , `` It has killed me too , and that is a comfort . ''
Parsing [sent. 6778 len. 7]: The curate only looked his reply .
Parsing [sent. 6779 len. 29]: `` They say , '' resumed Leopold , after a while , `` that God takes the will for the deed : -- do you think so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6780 len. 13]: `` Certainly , if it be a true , genuine will . ''
Parsing [sent. 6781 len. 15]: `` I am sure I meant to give myself up , '' said Leopold .
Parsing [sent. 6782 len. 12]: `` I had not the slightest idea they were fooling me .
Parsing [sent. 6783 len. 11]: I know it now , but what can I do ?
Parsing [sent. 6784 len. 14]: I am so weak , I should only die on the way . ''
Parsing [sent. 6785 len. 12]: He tried to rise , but fell back in the chair .
Parsing [sent. 6786 len. 4]: `` Oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6787 len. 15]: he sighed , `` is n't it good of God to let me die !
Parsing [sent. 6788 len. 13]: Who knows what he may do for me on the other side !
Parsing [sent. 6789 len. 15]: Who can tell what the bounty of a God like Jesus may be ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6790 len. 27]: A vision arose before the mind 's eye of the curate : -- Emmeline kneeling for Leopold 's forgiveness ; but he wisely held his peace .
Parsing [sent. 6791 len. 29]: The comforter of the sinner must come from the forgiveness of God , not from the favourable judgment of man mitigating the harshness of his judgment of himself .
Parsing [sent. 6792 len. 16]: Wingfold 's business was to start him well in the world whither he was going .
Parsing [sent. 6793 len. 28]: He must fill his scrip with the only wealth that would not dissolve in the waters of the river -- that was , the knowledge of Jesus .
Parsing [sent. 6794 len. 32]: It shot a terrible pang to the heart of Helen , herself , for all her suffering , so full of life , when she learned that her darling must die .
Parsing [sent. 6795 len. 11]: Yet was there no small consolation mingled with the shock .
Parsing [sent. 6796 len. 12]: Fear vanished , and love returned with grief in twofold strength .
Parsing [sent. 6797 len. 49]: She flew to him , and she who had been so self-contained , so composed , so unsubmissive to any sway of feeling , broke into such a storm of passionate affection that the vexilla mortis answered from his bosom , flaunting themselves in crimson before her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 6798 len. 42]: In vain , for Leopold 's sake , the curate had sought to quiet her : she had resented his interference ; but this result of her impetuosity speedily brought her to her senses , and set her to subdue herself .
Parsing [sent. 6799 len. 28]: The same evening Leopold insisted on dictating to the curate his confession , which done , he signed it , making him and Helen attest the signature .
Parsing [sent. 6800 len. 35]: This document Wingfold took charge of , promising to make the right use of it , whatever he should on reflection conclude that to be ; after which Leopold 's mind seemed at ease .
Parsing [sent. 6801 len. 46]: His sufferings from cough and weakness and fever now augmented with greater rapidity , but it was plain from the kind of light in his eye , and the far look which was not yet retrospective , that hope and expectation were high in him .
Parsing [sent. 6802 len. 33]: He had his times of gloom , when the dragon of the past crept out of its cave , and tore him afresh ; but the prospect of coming deliverance strengthened him .
Parsing [sent. 6803 len. 24]: `` Do you really think , '' he said once to the curate , `` that I shall ever see Emmeline again ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6804 len. 19]: `` Truly I hope so , '' answered his friend , `` and could argue upon the point .
Parsing [sent. 6805 len. 46]: But I think the best way , when doubt comes as to anything you would like to be true , is just to hide yourself in God , as the child would hide from the dark in the folds of his mother 's mantle . ''
Parsing [sent. 6806 len. 24]: `` But aunt would say , if she knew , that , dying as she did , Emmeline could not be saved . ''
Parsing [sent. 6807 len. 25]: `` Some people may have to be a good deal astonished as to what can and can not be , '' returned the curate .
Parsing [sent. 6808 len. 21]: `` But never mind what people say : make your appeal to the saviour of men about whatever troubles you .
Parsing [sent. 6809 len. 9]: Cry to the faithful creator , his Father .
Parsing [sent. 6810 len. 21]: To be a faithful creator needs a might of truth and loving-kindness of which our narrow hearts can ill conceive .
Parsing [sent. 6811 len. 17]: Ask much of God , my boy , and be very humble and very hoping . ''
Parsing [sent. 6812 len. 16]: After all such utterances , Leopold would look his thanks , and hold his peace .
Parsing [sent. 6813 len. 12]: `` I wish it was over , '' he said once .
Parsing [sent. 6814 len. 10]: `` So do I , '' returned the curate .
Parsing [sent. 6815 len. 26]: `` But be of good courage , I think nothing will be given you to bear that you will not be able to bear . ''
Parsing [sent. 6816 len. 14]: `` I can bear a great deal more than I have had yet .
Parsing [sent. 6817 len. 9]: I do n't think I shall ever complain .
Parsing [sent. 6818 len. 19]: That would be to take myself out of his hands , and I have no hope anywhere else .
Parsing [sent. 6819 len. 17]: -- Are you any surer about him , sir , than you used to be ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6820 len. 14]: `` At least I hope in him far more , '' answered Wingfold .
Parsing [sent. 6821 len. 6]: `` Is that enough ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6822 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 6823 len. 5]: I want more . ''
Parsing [sent. 6824 len. 20]: `` I wish I could come back and tell you that I am alive and all is true . ''
Parsing [sent. 6825 len. 21]: `` I would rather have the natural way of it , and get the good of not knowing first . ''
Parsing [sent. 6826 len. 20]: `` But if I could tell you I had found God , then that would make you sure . ''
Parsing [sent. 6827 len. 27]: Wingfold could not help a smile : -- as if any assurance from such a simple soul could reach the questions that tossed his troubled spirit !
Parsing [sent. 6828 len. 17]: `` I think I shall find all I want in Jesus Christ , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 6829 len. 12]: `` But you ca n't see him , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 6830 len. 7]: `` Perhaps I can do better .
Parsing [sent. 6831 len. 13]: And at all events I can wait , '' said the curate .
Parsing [sent. 6832 len. 21]: `` Even if he would let me , I would not see him one moment before he thought it best .
Parsing [sent. 6833 len. 20]: I would not be out of a doubt or difficulty an hour sooner than he would take me . ''
Parsing [sent. 6834 len. 9]: Leopold gazed at him and said no more .
Parsing [sent. 6835 len. 3]: CHAPTER XVIII .
Parsing [sent. 6836 len. 3]: THE MEADOW .
Parsing [sent. 6837 len. 18]: As the disease advanced , his desire for fresh air and freedom grew to a great longing .
Parsing [sent. 6838 len. 56]: One hot day , whose ardours , too strong for the leaves whose springs had begun to dry up , were burning them `` yellow and black and pale and hectic red , '' the fancy seized him to get out of the garden with its clipt box-trees and cypresses , into the meadow beyond .
Parsing [sent. 6839 len. 25]: There a red cow was switching her tail as she gathered her milk from the world , and looking as if all were well .
Parsing [sent. 6840 len. 24]: He liked the look of the cow , and the open meadow , and wanted to share it with her , he said .
Parsing [sent. 6841 len. 16]: Helen , with the anxiety of a careful nurse , feared it might hurt him .
Parsing [sent. 6842 len. 7]: `` What DOES it matter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6843 len. 3]: he returned .
Parsing [sent. 6844 len. 16]: `` Is life so sweet that every moment more of it is a precious boon ?
Parsing [sent. 6845 len. 20]: After I 'm gone a few days , you wo n't know a week from an hour of me .
Parsing [sent. 6846 len. 9]: What a weight it will be off you !
Parsing [sent. 6847 len. 9]: I envy you all the relief of it .
Parsing [sent. 6848 len. 19]: It will be to you just what it would be to me to get into that meadow . ''
Parsing [sent. 6849 len. 10]: Helen made haste to let him have his will .
Parsing [sent. 6850 len. 16]: They prepared a sort of litter , and the curate and the coachman carried him .
Parsing [sent. 6851 len. 39]: Hearing what they were about , Mrs. Ramshorn hurried into the garden to protest , but protested in vain , and joined the little procession , walking with Helen , like a second mourner , after the bier .
Parsing [sent. 6852 len. 28]: They crossed the lawn , and through a double row of small cypresses went winding down to the underground passage , as if to the tomb itself .
Parsing [sent. 6853 len. 18]: They had not thought of opening the door first , and the place was dark and sepulchral .
Parsing [sent. 6854 len. 7]: Helen hastened to set it wide .
Parsing [sent. 6855 len. 13]: `` Lay me down for a moment , '' said Leopold . ''
Parsing [sent. 6856 len. 8]: -- Here I lie in my tomb !
Parsing [sent. 6857 len. 8]: How soft and brown the light is !
Parsing [sent. 6858 len. 29]: I should not mind lying here , half-asleep , half-awake , for centuries , if only I had the hope of a right good waking at last . ''
Parsing [sent. 6859 len. 37]: A flood of fair light flashed in sweet torrent into the place -- and there , framed in the doorway , but far across the green field , stood the red cow , switching her tail .
Parsing [sent. 6860 len. 8]: `` And here comes my resurrection ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6861 len. 3]: cried Leopold .
Parsing [sent. 6862 len. 15]: `` I have not had long to wait for it -- have I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6863 len. 20]: He smiled a pained content as he spoke , and they bore him out into the sun and air .
Parsing [sent. 6864 len. 44]: They set him down in the middle of the field in a low chair -- not far from a small clump of trees , through which the footpath led to the stile whereon the curate was seated when he first saw the Polwarths .
Parsing [sent. 6865 len. 20]: Mrs. Ramshorn found the fancy of the sick man pleasant for the hale , and sent for her knitting .
Parsing [sent. 6866 len. 28]: Helen sat down empty-handed on the wool at her brother 's feet , and Wingfold , taking a book from his pocket , withdrew to the trees .
Parsing [sent. 6867 len. 21]: He had not read long , sitting within sight and call of the group , when Helen came to him .
Parsing [sent. 6868 len. 13]: `` He seems inclined to go to sleep , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 6869 len. 15]: `` Perhaps if you would read something , it would send him off . ''
Parsing [sent. 6870 len. 21]: `` I will with pleasure , '' he said , and returning with her , sat down on the grass .
Parsing [sent. 6871 len. 18]: `` May I read you a few verses I came upon the other day , Leopold ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6872 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 6873 len. 12]: `` Please do , '' answered the invalid , rather sleepily .
Parsing [sent. 6874 len. 22]: I will not pledge myself that the verses belonged to the book Wingfold held before him , but here they are .
Parsing [sent. 6875 len. 16]: He read them slowly , and as evenly and softly and rhythmically as he could .
Parsing [sent. 6876 len. 38]: They come to thee , the halt , the maimed , the blind , The devil-torn , the sick , the sore ; Thy heart their well of life they find , Thine ear their open door .
Parsing [sent. 6877 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 6878 len. 16]: who can tell the joy in Palestine -- What smiles and tears of rescued throngs !
Parsing [sent. 6879 len. 16]: Their lees of life were turned to wine , Their prayers to shouts and songs !
Parsing [sent. 6880 len. 30]: The story dear our wise men fable call , Give paltry facts the mighty range ; To me it seems just what should fall , And nothing very strange .
Parsing [sent. 6881 len. 33]: But were I deaf and lame and blind and sore , I scarce would care for cure to ask ; Another prayer should haunt thy door -- Set thee a harder task .
Parsing [sent. 6882 len. 21]: If thou art Christ , see here this heart of mine , Torn , empty , moaning , and unblest !
Parsing [sent. 6883 len. 14]: Had ever heart more need of thine , If thine indeed hath rest ?
Parsing [sent. 6884 len. 33]: Thy word , thy hand right soon did scare the bane That in their bodies death did breed : If thou canst cure my deeper pain , Then thou art Lord indeed .
Parsing [sent. 6885 len. 16]: Leopold smiled sleepily as Wingfold read , and ere the reading was over , slept .
Parsing [sent. 6886 len. 10]: `` What can the little object want here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6887 len. 4]: said Mrs. Ramshorn .
Parsing [sent. 6888 len. 17]: Wingfold looked up , and seeing who it was approaching them , said , `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 6889 len. 12]: that is Mr. Polwarth , who keeps the park gate . ''
Parsing [sent. 6890 len. 12]: `` Nobody can well mistake him , '' returned Mrs. Ramshorn .
Parsing [sent. 6891 len. 7]: `` Everybody knows the creature . ''
Parsing [sent. 6892 len. 11]: `` Few people know him really , '' said Wingfold .
Parsing [sent. 6893 len. 22]: `` I HAVE heard that he is an oddity in mind as well as in body , '' said Mrs. Ramshorn .
Parsing [sent. 6894 len. 13]: `` He is a friend of mine , '' rejoined the curate .
Parsing [sent. 6895 len. 8]: `` I will go and meet him .
Parsing [sent. 6896 len. 9]: He wants to know how Leopold is . ''
Parsing [sent. 6897 len. 9]: `` Pray keep your seat , Mr. Wingfold .
Parsing [sent. 6898 len. 14]: I do n't in the least mind him , '' said Mrs. Ramshorn .
Parsing [sent. 6899 len. 19]: `` Any FRIEND of yours , as you are kind enough to call him , will be welcome .
Parsing [sent. 6900 len. 19]: Clergymen come to know -- indeed it is their duty to be acquainted with all sorts of people .
Parsing [sent. 6901 len. 14]: The late dean of Halystone would stop and speak to a pauper . ''
Parsing [sent. 6902 len. 32]: The curate did however go and meet Polwarth , and returning with him presented him to Mrs. Ramshorn , who received him with perfect condescension , and a most gracious bow .
Parsing [sent. 6903 len. 18]: Helen bent her head also , very differently , but it would be hard to say how .
Parsing [sent. 6904 len. 35]: The little man turned from them , and for a moment stood looking on the face of the sleeping youth : he had not seen him since Helen ordered him to leave the house .
Parsing [sent. 6905 len. 14]: Even now she looked angry at his presumption in staring at her brother .
Parsing [sent. 6906 len. 8]: But Polwarth did not see her look .
Parsing [sent. 6907 len. 14]: A great tenderness came over his face , and his lips moved softly .
Parsing [sent. 6908 len. 15]: `` The Lord of thy life keep it for thee , my son ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6909 len. 12]: he murmured , gazed a moment longer , then rejoined Wingfold .
Parsing [sent. 6910 len. 7]: They walked aside a few paces .
Parsing [sent. 6911 len. 26]: `` Pray be seated , '' said Mrs. Ramshorn , without looking up from her knitting -- the seat she offered being the wide meadow .
Parsing [sent. 6912 len. 46]: But they had already done so , and presently were deep in a gentle talk , of which at length certain words that had been foolhardy enough to wander within her range , attracted the notice of Mrs. Ramshorn , and she began to listen .
Parsing [sent. 6913 len. 7]: But she could not hear distinctly .
Parsing [sent. 6914 len. 119]: `` There should be one bishop at least , '' the little man was saying , `` or I do n't know but he ought to be the arch-arch-bishop , -- a poor man , if possible , -- one like the country parson Chaucer sets up in contrast with the regular clergy , -- whose main business should be to travel about from university to university , from college to college , from school to school , warning off all young men who did not know within themselves that it was neither for position , nor income , nor study , nor influence , that they sought to minister in the temple , from entering the church .
Parsing [sent. 6915 len. 12]: As from holy ground , he would warn them off . ''
Parsing [sent. 6916 len. 113]: Mrs. Ramshorn fancied , from certain obscure associations in her own mind , that he was speaking of dissenting ministers and persons of low origin , who might wish to enter the church for the sake of BETTERING THEMSELVES , and holding as she did , that no church preferment should be obtained except by persons of good family and position , qualified to keep up the dignity of the profession , she was not a little gratified to hear , as she supposed , the same sentiments from the mouth of such an illiterate person as , taking no note of his somewhat remarkable utterance , she imagined Polwarth to be .
Parsing [sent. 6917 len. 11]: Therefore she proceeded to patronize him yet a little farther .
Parsing [sent. 6918 len. 12]: `` I quite agree with you , '' she said graciously .
Parsing [sent. 6919 len. 21]: `` None but such as you describe should presume to set foot within the sacred precincts of the profession . ''
Parsing [sent. 6920 len. 53]: Polwarth did not much relish Mrs. Ramshorn 's style , and was considerably surprised at receiving such a hearty approval of a proposed reformation in clerical things , reaching even to the archiepiscopal , which he had put half-humorously , and yet in thorough earnest , for the ear of Wingfold only .
Parsing [sent. 6921 len. 39]: He was little enough desirous of pursuing the conversation with Mrs. Ramshorn : Charity herself does not require of a man to cast his precious things at the feet of my lady Disdain ; but he must reply .
Parsing [sent. 6922 len. 32]: `` Yes , '' he said , `` the great evil in the church has always been the presence in it of persons unsuited for the work there required of them .
Parsing [sent. 6923 len. 35]: One very simple sifting rule would be , that no one should be admitted to holy orders who had not first proved himself capable of making a better living in some other calling . ''
Parsing [sent. 6924 len. 25]: `` I can not go with you so far as that -- so few careers are opened to gentlemen , '' rejoined Mrs. Ramshorn .
Parsing [sent. 6925 len. 24]: `` Besides -- take the bar , for instance : the forensic style a man must there acquire would hardly become the pulpit .
Parsing [sent. 6926 len. 29]: But it would not be a bad rule that everyone , for admission to holy orders , should be possessed of property sufficient at least to live upon .
Parsing [sent. 6927 len. 30]: With that for a foundation , his living would begin at once to tell , and he would immediately occupy the superior position every clergyman ought to have . ''
Parsing [sent. 6928 len. 62]: `` What I was thinking of , '' said Polwarth , `` was mainly the experience in life he would gather by having to make his own living ; that , behind the counter or the plough , or in the workshop , he would come to know men and their struggles and their thoughts -- '' `` Good heavens ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6929 len. 4]: exclaimed Mrs. Ramshorn .
Parsing [sent. 6930 len. 9]: `` But I must be under some misapprehension !
Parsing [sent. 6931 len. 17]: It is not possible you can be speaking of the CHURCH -- of the clerical PROFESSION .
Parsing [sent. 6932 len. 29]: The moment that is brought within the reach of such people as you describe , that moment the church sinks to the level of the catholic priesthood . ''
Parsing [sent. 6933 len. 48]: `` Say rather , to the level of Jeremy Taylor , '' returned Polwarth , `` who was the son of a barber ; or of Tillotson , who was the son of a clothier , or something of the sort , and certainly a fierce dissenter .
Parsing [sent. 6934 len. 10]: His enemies said the archbishop himself was never baptized .
Parsing [sent. 6935 len. 65]: By-the-way , he was not ordained till he was thirty -- and that bears on what I was just saying to Mr. Wingfold , that I would have no one ordained till after forty , by which time he would know whether he had any real call or only a temptation to the church , from the base hope of an easy living . ''
Parsing [sent. 6936 len. 13]: By this time Mrs. Ramshorn had had more than enough of it .
Parsing [sent. 6937 len. 17]: The man was a leveller , a chartist , a positivist -- a despiser of dignities !
Parsing [sent. 6938 len. 29]: `` Mr. -- , Mr. -- , I do n't know your name -- you will oblige me by uttering no more such vile slanders in my company .
Parsing [sent. 6939 len. 13]: You are talking about what you do n't in the least understand .
Parsing [sent. 6940 len. 21]: The man who does not respect the religion of his native country is capable of -- of -- of ANYTHING .
Parsing [sent. 6941 len. 29]: -- I am astonished , Mr. Wingfold , at your allowing a member of your congregation to speak with so little regard for the feelings of the clergy .
Parsing [sent. 6942 len. 31]: -- You forget , sir , when you attribute what you call base motives to the cloth -- you forget who said the labourer was worthy of his hire . ''
Parsing [sent. 6943 len. 7]: `` I hope not , madam .
Parsing [sent. 6944 len. 26]: I only venture to suggest that , though the labourer is worthy of his hire , not every man is worthy of the labour . ''
Parsing [sent. 6945 len. 11]: Wingfold was highly amused at the turn things had taken .
Parsing [sent. 6946 len. 20]: Polwarth looked annoyed at having allowed himself to be beguiled into such an utterly useless beating of the air .
Parsing [sent. 6947 len. 34]: `` My friend HAS some rather peculiar notions , Mrs. Ramshorn , '' said the curate ; '' but you must admit it was your approval that encouraged him to go on . ''
Parsing [sent. 6948 len. 26]: `` It is quite as well to know what people think , '' answered Mrs. Ramshorn , pretending she had drawn him out from suspicion .
Parsing [sent. 6949 len. 37]: `` My husband used to say that very few of the clergy had any notion of the envy and opposition of the lower orders , both to them personally , and to the doctrines they taught .
Parsing [sent. 6950 len. 12]: To low human nature the truth has always been unpalatable . ''
Parsing [sent. 6951 len. 49]: What precisely she meant by THE TRUTH it would be hard to say , but if the visual embodiment of it was not a departed dean , it was at least always associated in her mind with a cathedral choir , and a portly person in silk stockings .
Parsing [sent. 6952 len. 13]: Here happily Leopold woke , and his eyes fell upon the gate-keeper .
Parsing [sent. 6953 len. 6]: `` Ah , Mr. Polwarth !
Parsing [sent. 6954 len. 9]: I am so glad to see you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6955 len. 4]: he said . ''
Parsing [sent. 6956 len. 8]: I am getting on , you see .
Parsing [sent. 6957 len. 7]: It will be over soon . ''
Parsing [sent. 6958 len. 22]: `` I see , '' replied Polwarth , going up to him , and taking his offered hand in both his .
Parsing [sent. 6959 len. 18]: `` I could almost envy you for having got so near the end of your troubles . ''
Parsing [sent. 6960 len. 15]: `` Are you sure it will be the end of them , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6961 len. 16]: `` Of some of them at least , I hope , and those the worst .
Parsing [sent. 6962 len. 22]: I can not be sure of anything but that all things work together for good to them that love God . ''
Parsing [sent. 6963 len. 13]: `` I do n't know yet whether I do love God . ''
Parsing [sent. 6964 len. 9]: `` Not the father of Jesus Christ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6965 len. 21]: `` If God is really just like him , I do n't see how any man could help loving him .
Parsing [sent. 6966 len. 6]: But , do you know ?
Parsing [sent. 6967 len. 12]: I am terrified sometimes at the thought of seeing MY father .
Parsing [sent. 6968 len. 7]: He was such a severe man !
Parsing [sent. 6969 len. 9]: I am afraid he will scorn me . ''
Parsing [sent. 6970 len. 11]: `` Never -- if he has got into heavenly ways .
Parsing [sent. 6971 len. 13]: And you have your mother there too , have you not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6972 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 6973 len. 9]: yes ; I did n't think of that .
Parsing [sent. 6974 len. 9]: I do n't remember much of her . ''
Parsing [sent. 6975 len. 15]: `` Anyhow , you have God there , and you must rest in him .
Parsing [sent. 6976 len. 15]: He will not forget you , for that would be ceasing to be God .
Parsing [sent. 6977 len. 33]: If God were to forget for one moment , the universe would grow black -- vanish -- rush out again from the realm of law and order into chaos and night . ''
Parsing [sent. 6978 len. 8]: `` But I have been wicked . ''
Parsing [sent. 6979 len. 17]: `` The more need you have , if possible , of your Father in heaven . ''
Parsing [sent. 6980 len. 23]: Here Mrs. Ramshorn beckoned the attendance of the curate where she sat a few yards off on the other side of Leopold .
Parsing [sent. 6981 len. 46]: She was a little ashamed of having condescended to lose her temper , and when the curate went up to her , said , with an attempt at gaiety : `` Is your odd little friend , as you call him , all -- ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6982 len. 10]: And she tapped her lace-cap carefully with her finger .
Parsing [sent. 6983 len. 12]: `` Rather more so than most people , '' answered Wingfold .
Parsing [sent. 6984 len. 9]: `` He is a very remarkable man . ''
Parsing [sent. 6985 len. 28]: `` He speaks as if he had seen better days -- though where he can have gathered such detestable revolutionary notions , I ca n't think . ''
Parsing [sent. 6986 len. 17]: `` He is a man of education , as you see , '' said the curate .
Parsing [sent. 6987 len. 14]: `` You do n't mean he has been to Oxford or Cambridge ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6988 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 6989 len. 15]: His education has been of a much higher sort than is generally found there .
Parsing [sent. 6990 len. 12]: He knows ten times as much as most university men . ''
Parsing [sent. 6991 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 6992 len. 14]: yes ; but that goes for nothing : he has n't the standing .
Parsing [sent. 6993 len. 16]: And if he had been to Oxford , he never could have imbibed such notions .
Parsing [sent. 6994 len. 5]: Besides -- his manners !
Parsing [sent. 6995 len. 24]: To speak of the clergy as he did in the hearing of one whose whole history is bound up with the church ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6996 len. 7]: She meant herself , not Wingfold .
Parsing [sent. 6997 len. 34]: `` But of course , '' she went on , `` there must be something VERY wrong with him to know so much as you say , and occupy such a menial position !
Parsing [sent. 6998 len. 15]: Nothing but a gate-keeper , and talk like that about bishops and what not !
Parsing [sent. 6999 len. 13]: People that are crooked in body are always crooked in mind too .
Parsing [sent. 7000 len. 20]: I dare say now he has quite a coterie of friends and followers amongst the lower orders in Glaston .
Parsing [sent. 7001 len. 14]: He 's just the sort of man to lead the working classes astray .
Parsing [sent. 7002 len. 26]: No doubt he is a very interesting study for a young man like you , but you must take care ; you may be misunderstood .
Parsing [sent. 7003 len. 20]: A young clergyman CA N'T be too cautious -- if he has any hope of rising in his profession .
Parsing [sent. 7004 len. 7]: -- A gate-keeper , indeed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7005 len. 13]: `` Was n't it something like that David wanted to be ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7006 len. 4]: said the curate .
Parsing [sent. 7007 len. 15]: `` Mr. Wingfold , I never allow any such foolish jests in my hearing .
Parsing [sent. 7008 len. 22]: It was a DOOR-keeper the Psalmist said -- and to the house of God , not a nobleman 's park . ''
Parsing [sent. 7009 len. 11]: `` A verger , I suppose , '' thought Wingfold .
Parsing [sent. 7010 len. 25]: -- `` Seriously , Mrs. Ramshorn , that poor little atom of a creature is the wisest man I know , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 7011 len. 23]: `` Likely enough , in YOUR judgment , Mr. Wingfold , '' said the dean 's widow , and drew herself up .
Parsing [sent. 7012 len. 16]: The curate accepted his dismissal , and joined the little man by Leopold 's chair .
Parsing [sent. 7013 len. 18]: `` I wish you two could be with me when I am dying , '' said Leopold .
Parsing [sent. 7014 len. 22]: `` If you will let your sister know your wish , you may easily have it , '' said the curate .
Parsing [sent. 7015 len. 50]: `` It will be just like saying good-bye at the pier-head , and pushing off alone -- you ca n't get more than one into the boat -- out , out , alone , into the infinite ocean of -- nobody knows what or where , '' said Leopold .
Parsing [sent. 7016 len. 21]: `` Except those that are there already , and they will be waiting to receive you , '' said Polwarth .
Parsing [sent. 7017 len. 24]: `` You may well hope , if you have friends to see you off , you will have friends to welcome you too .
Parsing [sent. 7018 len. 42]: But I think it 's not so much like setting off from the pier-head , as getting down the side of the ocean-ship , to laud at the pier-head , where your friends are all standing looking out for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 7019 len. 3]: `` Well !
Parsing [sent. 7020 len. 15]: I do n't know , '' said Leopold , with a sigh of weariness .
Parsing [sent. 7021 len. 11]: `` I 'm thankful sometimes that I 've grown stupid .
Parsing [sent. 7022 len. 7]: I suppose it 's with dying .
Parsing [sent. 7023 len. 8]: I did n't use to feel so .
Parsing [sent. 7024 len. 12]: Sometimes I seem not to know or care anything about anything .
Parsing [sent. 7025 len. 14]: I only want to stop coughing and aching and go to sleep . ''
Parsing [sent. 7026 len. 15]: `` Jesus was glad to give up his spirit into his Father 's hands .
Parsing [sent. 7027 len. 10]: He was very tired before he got away . ''
Parsing [sent. 7028 len. 4]: `` Thank you .
Parsing [sent. 7029 len. 3]: Thank you .
Parsing [sent. 7030 len. 4]: I have him .
Parsing [sent. 7031 len. 4]: He is somewhere .
Parsing [sent. 7032 len. 17]: You ca n't mention his name but it brings me something to live and hope for .
Parsing [sent. 7033 len. 10]: If he is there , all will be well .
Parsing [sent. 7034 len. 38]: And if I do get too tired to care for anything , he wo n't mind ; he will only let me go to sleep , and wake me up again by-and-by when I am rested . ''
Parsing [sent. 7035 len. 5]: He closed his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 7036 len. 12]: `` I want to go to bed , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 7037 len. 7]: They carried him into the house .
Parsing [sent. 7038 len. 3]: CHAPTER XIX .
Parsing [sent. 7039 len. 4]: RACHEL AND LEOPOLD .
Parsing [sent. 7040 len. 26]: Every day after this , so long as the weather continued warm , it was Leopold 's desire to be carried out to the meadow .
Parsing [sent. 7041 len. 37]: Once at his earnest petition , instead of setting him down in the usual place , they went on with him into the park , but he soon wished to be taken back to the meadow .
Parsing [sent. 7042 len. 42]: He did not like the trees to come between him and his bed : they made him feel like a rabbit that was too far from its hole , he said ; and he was never tempted to try it again .
Parsing [sent. 7043 len. 48]: Regularly too every day , about one o'clock , the gnome-like form of the gate-keeper would issue from the little door in the park-fence , and come marching across the grass towards Leopold 's chair , which was set near the small clump of trees already mentioned .
Parsing [sent. 7044 len. 40]: The curate was almost always there , not talking much to the invalid , but letting him know every now and then by some little attention or word , or merely by showing himself , that he was near .
Parsing [sent. 7045 len. 40]: Sometimes he would take refuge from the heat , which the Indian never felt too great , amongst the trees , and there would generally be thinking out what he wanted to say to his people the next Sunday .
Parsing [sent. 7046 len. 68]: One thing he found strange , and could not satisfy himself concerning , namely , that although his mind was so much occupied with Helen that he often seemed unable to think consecutively upon any subject , he could always foresee his sermon best when , seated behind one of the trees , he could by moving his head see her at work beside Leopold 's chair .
Parsing [sent. 7047 len. 39]: But the thing that did carry him through became plain enough to him afterwards : his faith in God was all the time growing -- and that through what seemed at the time only a succession of interruptions .
Parsing [sent. 7048 len. 91]: Nothing is so ruinous to progress in which effort is needful , as satisfaction with apparent achievement ; that ever sounds a halt ; but Wingfold 's experience was that no sooner did he set his foot on the lowest hillock of self-congratulation than some fresh difficulty came that threw him prostrate ; and he rose again only in the strength of the necessity for deepening and broadening his foundations that he might build yet higher , trust yet farther : that was the only way not to lose everything .
Parsing [sent. 7049 len. 82]: He was gradually learning that his faith must be an absolute one , claiming from God everything the love of a perfect Father could give , or the needs he had created in his child could desire ; that he must not look to himself first for help , or imagine that the divine was only the supplement to the weakness and failure of the human ; that the highest effort of the human was to lay hold of the divine .
Parsing [sent. 7050 len. 78]: He learned that he could keep no simplest law in its loveliness until he was possessed of the same spirit whence that law sprung ; that he could not love Helen aright , simply , perfectly , unselfishly , except through the presence of the originating Love ; that the one thing wherein he might imitate the free creative will of God was to will the presence and power of that will which gave birth to his .
Parsing [sent. 7051 len. 62]: It was the vital growth of this faith , even when he was too much troubled to recognize the fact , that made him strong in the midst of weakness ; when the son of man in him cried out , Let this cup pass , the son of God in him could yet cry , Let thy will be done .
Parsing [sent. 7052 len. 12]: He could `` inhabit trembling , '' and yet be brave .
Parsing [sent. 7053 len. 74]: Mrs. Ramshorn generally came to the meadow to see how the invalid was after he was settled , but she seldom staid : she was not fond of nursing , neither was there any need of her assistance ; and as Helen never dreamed now of opposing the smallest wish of her brother , there was no longer any obstruction to the visits of Polwarth , which were eagerly looked for by Leopold .
Parsing [sent. 7054 len. 33]: One day the little man did not appear , but soon after his usual time the still more gnome-like form of his little niece came scrambling rather than walking over the meadow .
Parsing [sent. 7055 len. 76]: Gently and modestly , almost shyly , she came up to Helen , made her a courtesy like a village school-girl , and said , while she glanced at Leopold now and then with an ocean of tenderness in her large , clear woman-eyes : `` My uncle is sorry , Miss Lingard , that he can not come to see your brother to-day , but he is laid up with an attack of asthma .
Parsing [sent. 7056 len. 24]: He wished Mr. Lingard to know that he was thinking of him : -- shall I tell you just what he said ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7057 len. 15]: Helen bent her neck : she did not feel much interest in the matter .
Parsing [sent. 7058 len. 21]: But Leopold said , `` Every word of such a good man is precious : tell me , please . ''
Parsing [sent. 7059 len. 15]: Rachel turned to him with the flush of a white rose on her face .
Parsing [sent. 7060 len. 19]: `` I asked him , sir -- ` Shall I tell him you are praying for him ? '
Parsing [sent. 7061 len. 7]: and he said , ` No .
Parsing [sent. 7062 len. 20]: I am not exactly praying for him , but I am thinking of God and him together . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 7063 len. 8]: The tears rose in Leopold 's eyes .
Parsing [sent. 7064 len. 21]: Rachel lifted her baby-hand , and stroked the dusky , long-fingured one that lay upon the arm of the chair .
Parsing [sent. 7065 len. 57]: `` Dear Mr. Lingard , '' she said , -- Helen stopped in the middle of an embroidery stitch , and gave her a look as if she were about to ask for her testimonials -- `` I could well wish , if it pleased God , that I were as near home as you . ''
Parsing [sent. 7066 len. 7]: Leopold took her hand in his .
Parsing [sent. 7067 len. 7]: `` Do you suffer then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7068 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 7069 len. 39]: `` Just look at me , '' she answered with a smile that was very pitiful , though she did not mean it for such , '' -- shut up all my life in this epitome of deformity !
Parsing [sent. 7070 len. 13]: But I ai n't grumbling : that would be a fine thing !
Parsing [sent. 7071 len. 13]: My house is not so small but God can get into it .
Parsing [sent. 7072 len. 14]: Only you ca n't think how tired I often am of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 7073 len. 29]: `` Mr. Wingfold was telling me yesterday that some people fancy St. Paul was little and misshapen , and that that was his thorn in the flesh . ''
Parsing [sent. 7074 len. 27]: `` I do n't think that can be true , or he would never have compared his body to a tabernacle , for , oh dear !
Parsing [sent. 7075 len. 12]: it wo n't stretch an inch to give a body room .
Parsing [sent. 7076 len. 31]: I do n't think either , if that had been the case , he would have said he did n't want it taken off , but another put over it .
Parsing [sent. 7077 len. 32]: I do want mine taken off me , and a downright good new one put on instead -- something not quite so far off your sister 's there , Mr. Lingard .
Parsing [sent. 7078 len. 9]: But I 'm ashamed of talking like this .
Parsing [sent. 7079 len. 26]: It came of wanting to tell you I ca n't be sorry you are going when I should so dearly like to go myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 7080 len. 37]: `` And I would gladly stay a while , and that in a house no bigger than yours , if I had a conscience of the same sort in my back-parlour , '' said Leopold smiling .
Parsing [sent. 7081 len. 15]: `` But when I am gone the world will be the cleaner for it .
Parsing [sent. 7082 len. 17]: -- Do you know about God the same way your uncle does , Miss Polwarth ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7083 len. 9]: `` I hope I do -- a little .
Parsing [sent. 7084 len. 18]: I doubt if anybody knows as much as he does , '' she returned , very seriously .
Parsing [sent. 7085 len. 25]: `` But God knows about us all the same , and he do n't limit his goodness to us by our knowledge of him .
Parsing [sent. 7086 len. 12]: It 's so wonderful that he can be all to everybody !
Parsing [sent. 7087 len. 8]: That is his Godness , you know .
Parsing [sent. 7088 len. 10]: We ca n't be all to any one person .
Parsing [sent. 7089 len. 15]: Do what we will , we ca n't let anybody see into us even .
Parsing [sent. 7090 len. 8]: We are all in bits and spots .
Parsing [sent. 7091 len. 19]: But I fancy it 's a sign that we come of God that we do n't like it .
Parsing [sent. 7092 len. 18]: How gladly I would help you , Mr. Lingard , and I can do nothing for you .
Parsing [sent. 7093 len. 12]: -- I 'm afraid your beautiful sister thinks me very forward .
Parsing [sent. 7094 len. 34]: But she do n't know what it is to lie awake all night sometimes , think-thinking about my beautiful brothers and sisters that I ca n't get near to do anything for . ''
Parsing [sent. 7095 len. 7]: `` What an odd creature ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7096 len. 13]: thought Helen , to whom her talk conveyed next to nothing . ''
Parsing [sent. 7097 len. 12]: -- But I daresay they are both out of their minds .
Parsing [sent. 7098 len. 3]: Poor things !
Parsing [sent. 7099 len. 15]: they must have a hard time of it with one thing and another ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7100 len. 32]: `` I beg your pardon again for talking so much , '' concluded Rachel , and , with a courtesy first to the one then to the other , walked away .
Parsing [sent. 7101 len. 29]: Her gait was no square march like her uncle 's , but a sort of sidelong propulsion , rendered more laborious by the thick grass of the meadow .
Parsing [sent. 7102 len. 3]: CHAPTER XX .
Parsing [sent. 7103 len. 3]: THE BLOOD-HOUND .
Parsing [sent. 7104 len. 49]: I need not follow the steps by which the inquiry-office became able so far to enlighten the mother of Emmeline concerning the person and habits of the visitor to the deserted shaft , that she had now come to Glaston in pursuit of yet farther discovery concerning him .
Parsing [sent. 7105 len. 34]: She had no plan in her mind , and as yet merely intended going to church and everywhere else where people congregated , in the hope of something turning up to direct inquiry .
Parsing [sent. 7106 len. 10]: Not a suspicion of Leopold had ever crossed her .
Parsing [sent. 7107 len. 26]: She did not even know that he had a sister in Glaston , for Emmeline 's friends had not all been intimate with her parents .
Parsing [sent. 7108 len. 39]: On the morning after her arrival , she went out early to take a walk , and brood over her cherished vengeance ; and finding her way into the park , wandered about in it for some time .
Parsing [sent. 7109 len. 30]: Leaving it at length by another gate , and inquiring the way to Glaston , she was directed to a footpath which would lead her thither across the fields .
Parsing [sent. 7110 len. 23]: Following this , she came to a stile , and being rather weary with her long walk , sat down on it .
Parsing [sent. 7111 len. 8]: The day was a grand autumnal one .
Parsing [sent. 7112 len. 8]: But nature had no charms for her .
Parsing [sent. 7113 len. 54]: Indeed had she not been close shut in the gloomy chamber of her own thoughts , she would not thus have walked abroad alone ; for nature was to her a dull , featureless void ; while her past was scarcely of the sort to invite retrospection , and her future was clouded .
Parsing [sent. 7114 len. 50]: It so fell that just then Leopold was asleep in his chair , -- every morning he slept a little soon after being carried out , -- and that chair was in its usual place in the meadow , with the clump of trees between it and the stile .
Parsing [sent. 7115 len. 42]: Wingfold was seated in the shade of the trees , but Helen , happening to want something for her work , went to him and committed her brother to his care until she should return , whereupon he took her place .
Parsing [sent. 7116 len. 24]: Almost the same moment however , he spied Polwarth coming from the little door in the fence , and went to meet him .
Parsing [sent. 7117 len. 28]: When he turned , he saw , to his surprise , a lady standing beside the sleeping youth , and gazing at him with a strange intentness .
Parsing [sent. 7118 len. 17]: Polwarth had seen her come from the clump of trees , and supposed her a friend .
Parsing [sent. 7119 len. 19]: The curate walked hastily back , fearing he might wake and be startled at sight of the stranger .
Parsing [sent. 7120 len. 20]: So intent was the gazing lady that he was within a few yards of her before she heard him .
Parsing [sent. 7121 len. 17]: She started , gave one glance at the curate , and hurried away towards the town .
Parsing [sent. 7122 len. 26]: There was an agitation in her movements which Wingfold did not like ; a suspicion crossed his mind , and he resolved to follow her .
Parsing [sent. 7123 len. 18]: In his turn he made over his charge to Polwarth , and set off after the lady .
Parsing [sent. 7124 len. 56]: The moment the eyes of Emmeline 's mother fell upon the countenance of Leopold , whom , notwithstanding the change that suffering had caused , she recognized at once , partly by the peculiarity of his complexion , the suspicion , almost conviction , awoke in her that here was the murderer of her daughter .
Parsing [sent. 7125 len. 12]: That he looked so ill seemed only to confirm the likelihood .
Parsing [sent. 7126 len. 16]: Her first idea was to wake him and see the effect of her sudden presence .
Parsing [sent. 7127 len. 23]: Finding he was attended , however , she hurried away to inquire in the town and discover all she could about him .
Parsing [sent. 7128 len. 27]: A few moments after Polwarth had taken charge of him , and while he stood looking on him tenderly , the youth woke with a start .
Parsing [sent. 7129 len. 6]: `` Where is Helen ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7130 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 7131 len. 7]: `` I have not seen her .
Parsing [sent. 7132 len. 7]: Ah , here she comes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7133 len. 9]: `` Did you find me alone then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7134 len. 7]: `` Mr. Wingfold was with you .
Parsing [sent. 7135 len. 17]: He gave you up to me , because he had to go into the town . ''
Parsing [sent. 7136 len. 21]: He looked inquiringly at his sister as she came up , and she looked in the same way at Polwarth .
Parsing [sent. 7137 len. 38]: `` I feel as if I had been lying all alone in this wide field , '' said Leopold , `` and as if Emmeline had been by me , though I did n't see her . ''
Parsing [sent. 7138 len. 28]: Polwarth looked after the two retiring forms , which were now almost at the end of the meadow , and about to issue on the high road .
Parsing [sent. 7139 len. 7]: Helen followed his look with hers .
Parsing [sent. 7140 len. 7]: A sense of danger seized her .
Parsing [sent. 7141 len. 10]: She trembled , and kept behind Leopold 's chair .
Parsing [sent. 7142 len. 9]: `` Have you been coughing much to-day ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7143 len. 4]: asked the gate-keeper .
Parsing [sent. 7144 len. 12]: `` Yes , a good deal -- before I came out .
Parsing [sent. 7145 len. 11]: But it does not seem to do much good . ''
Parsing [sent. 7146 len. 10]: `` What good would you have it do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7147 len. 14]: `` I mean , it does n't do much to get it over .
Parsing [sent. 7148 len. 11]: Oh , Mr. Polwarth , I am so tired ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7149 len. 4]: `` Poor fellow !
Parsing [sent. 7150 len. 14]: I suppose it looks to you as if it would never be over .
Parsing [sent. 7151 len. 14]: But all the millions of the dead have got through it before you .
Parsing [sent. 7152 len. 18]: I do n't know that that makes much difference to the one who is going through it .
Parsing [sent. 7153 len. 9]: And yet it is a sort of company .
Parsing [sent. 7154 len. 30]: Only , the Lord of Life is with you , and that is real company , even in dying , when no one else can be with you . ''
Parsing [sent. 7155 len. 12]: `` If I could only feel he was with me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7156 len. 13]: `` You may feel his presence without knowing what it is . ''
Parsing [sent. 7157 len. 16]: `` I hope it is n't wrong to wish it over , Mr. Polwarth ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7158 len. 23]: `` I do n't think it is wrong to wish anything you can talk to him about and submit to his will .
Parsing [sent. 7159 len. 18]: St. Paul says , ` In everything let your requests be made known unto God . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 7160 len. 25]: `` I sometimes feel as if I would not ask him for anything , but just let him give me what he likes . ''
Parsing [sent. 7161 len. 24]: `` We must not want to be better than is required of us , for that is at once to grow worse . ''
Parsing [sent. 7162 len. 9]: `` I do n't quite understand you . ''
Parsing [sent. 7163 len. 23]: `` Not to ask may seem to you a more submissive way , but I do n't think it is so childlike .
Parsing [sent. 7164 len. 36]: It seems to me far better to say , ' O Lord , I should like this or that , but I would rather not have it if thou dost not like it also . '
Parsing [sent. 7165 len. 12]: Such prayer brings us into conscious and immediate relations with God .
Parsing [sent. 7166 len. 19]: Remember , our thoughts are then , passing to him , sent by our will into his mind .
Parsing [sent. 7167 len. 14]: Our Lord taught us to pray always and not get tired of it .
Parsing [sent. 7168 len. 34]: God , however poor creatures we may be , would have us talk to him , for then he can speak to us better than when we turn no face to him . ''
Parsing [sent. 7169 len. 29]: `` I wonder what I shall do the first thing when I find myself out -- out , I mean , in the air , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 7170 len. 20]: `` It does seem strange we should know so little of what is in some sense so near us !
Parsing [sent. 7171 len. 10]: that such a thin veil should be so impenetrable !
Parsing [sent. 7172 len. 14]: I fancy the first thing I should do would be to pray . ''
Parsing [sent. 7173 len. 14]: `` Then you think we shall pray there -- wherever it is ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7174 len. 25]: `` It seems to me as if I should go up in prayer the moment I got out of this dungeon of a body .
Parsing [sent. 7175 len. 39]: I am wrong to call it a dungeon , for it lies open to God 's fair world , and the loveliness of the earth comes into me through eyes and ears just as well as into you .
Parsing [sent. 7176 len. 15]: Still it is a pleasant thought that it will drop off me some day .
Parsing [sent. 7177 len. 23]: But for prayer -- I think all will pray there more than here -- in their hearts and souls I mean . ''
Parsing [sent. 7178 len. 20]: `` Then where would be the harm if you were to pray for me after I am gone ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7179 len. 6]: `` Nowhere that I know .
Parsing [sent. 7180 len. 48]: It were indeed a strange thing if I might pray for you up to the moment when you ceased to breathe , and therewith an iron gate close between us , and I could not even reach you through the ear of the Father of us both !
Parsing [sent. 7181 len. 70]: It is a faithless doctrine , for it supposes either that those parted from us can do without prayer , the thing Jesus himself could not do without , seeing it was his highest joy , or that God has so parted those who are in him from these who are in him , that there is no longer any relation , even with God , common to them .
Parsing [sent. 7182 len. 12]: The thing to me takes the form of an absurdity . ''
Parsing [sent. 7183 len. 31]: `` Ah , then , pray for me when I am dying , and do n't be careful to stop when you think I am gone , Mr. Polwarth . ''
Parsing [sent. 7184 len. 11]: `` I will remember , '' said the little man .
Parsing [sent. 7185 len. 20]: And now Helen had recovered herself , and came and took her usual seat by her brother 's side .
Parsing [sent. 7186 len. 20]: She cast an anxious glance now and then into Polwarth 's face , but dared not ask him anything .
Parsing [sent. 7187 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXI .
Parsing [sent. 7188 len. 4]: THE BLOOD-HOUND TRAVERSED .
Parsing [sent. 7189 len. 16]: Emmeline 's mother had not gone far before she became aware that she was followed .
Parsing [sent. 7190 len. 13]: It was a turning of the tables which she did not relish .
Parsing [sent. 7191 len. 33]: As would not have been unnatural , even had she been at peace with all the world , a certain feeling of undefined terror came upon her and threatened to overmaster her .
Parsing [sent. 7192 len. 30]: It was the more oppressive that she did not choose to turn and face her pursuer , feeling that to do so would be to confess consciousness of cause .
Parsing [sent. 7193 len. 74]: The fate of her daughter , seldom absent from her thoughts , now rose before her in association with herself , and was gradually swelling uneasiness into terror : who could tell but this man pressing on her heels in the solitary meadow , and not the poor youth who lay dying there in the chair , and who might indeed be only another of his victims , was the murderer of Emmeline !
Parsing [sent. 7194 len. 29]: Unconsciously she accelerated her pace until it was almost a run , but did not thereby widen by a single yard the distance between her and the curate .
Parsing [sent. 7195 len. 28]: When she came out on the high road , she gave a glance in each direction , and , avoiding the country , made for the houses .
Parsing [sent. 7196 len. 9]: A short lane led her into Pine street .
Parsing [sent. 7197 len. 38]: There she felt safe , the more that it was market-day and a good many people about , and slackened her pace , feeling confident that her pursuer , whoever he was , would now turn aside .
Parsing [sent. 7198 len. 26]: But she was disappointed , for , casting a glance over her shoulder , she saw that he still kept the same distance behind her .
Parsing [sent. 7199 len. 22]: She saw also , in that single look , that he was well-known , for several were saluting him at once .
Parsing [sent. 7200 len. 5]: What could it mean ?
Parsing [sent. 7201 len. 10]: It must be the G. B. of the Temple !
Parsing [sent. 7202 len. 8]: Should she stop and challenge his pursuit ?
Parsing [sent. 7203 len. 18]: The obstacle to this was a certain sinking at the heart accounted for by an old memory .
Parsing [sent. 7204 len. 6]: She must elude him instead .
Parsing [sent. 7205 len. 21]: But she did not know a single person in the place , or one house where she could seek refuge .
Parsing [sent. 7206 len. 7]: There was an hotel before her !
Parsing [sent. 7207 len. 21]: But , unattended , heated , disordered , to all appearance disreputable , what account could she give of herself ?
Parsing [sent. 7208 len. 18]: That she had been followed by some one everybody knew , and to whom everybody would listen !
Parsing [sent. 7209 len. 22]: Feebly debating thus with herself , she hurried along the pavement of Pine Street , with the Abbey church before her .
Parsing [sent. 7210 len. 23]: The footsteps behind her grew louder and quicker : the man had made up his mind and was coming up with her !
Parsing [sent. 7211 len. 12]: He might be mad , or ready to run all risks !
Parsing [sent. 7212 len. 13]: Probably he knew his life at stake through her perseverance and determination !
Parsing [sent. 7213 len. 27]: On came the footsteps , for the curate had indeed made up his mind to speak to her , and either remove or certify his apprehensions .
Parsing [sent. 7214 len. 7]: Nearer yet and nearer they came .
Parsing [sent. 7215 len. 17]: Her courage and strength were giving way together , and she should be at his mercy .
Parsing [sent. 7216 len. 22]: She darted into a shop , sank on a chair by the counter , and begged for a glass of water .
Parsing [sent. 7217 len. 19]: A young woman ran to fetch it , while Mr. Drew went upstairs for a glass of wine .
Parsing [sent. 7218 len. 23]: Returning with it he came from behind the counter , and approached the lady where she sat leaning her head upon it .
Parsing [sent. 7219 len. 33]: Meantime the curate also had entered the shop , and placed himself where he might , unseen by her , await her departure , for he could not speak to her there .
Parsing [sent. 7220 len. 14]: He had her full in sight when Mr. Drew went up to her .
Parsing [sent. 7221 len. 17]: `` Do me the favour , madam , '' he said -- but said no more .
Parsing [sent. 7222 len. 23]: For at the sound of his voice , the lady gave a violent start , and raising her head looked at him .
Parsing [sent. 7223 len. 7]: The wine-glass dropped from his hand .
Parsing [sent. 7224 len. 12]: She gave a half-choked cry , and sped from the shop .
Parsing [sent. 7225 len. 39]: The curate was on the spring after her when he was arrested by the look of the draper : he stood fixed where she had left him , white and trembling as if he had seen a ghost .
Parsing [sent. 7226 len. 18]: He went up to him , and said in a whisper : `` Who is she ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7227 len. 19]: `` Mrs. Drew , '' answered the draper , and the curate was after her like a greyhound .
Parsing [sent. 7228 len. 13]: A little crowd of the shop-people gathered in consternation about their master .
Parsing [sent. 7229 len. 44]: `` Pick up those pieces of glass , and call Jacob to wipe the floor , '' he said -- then walked to the door , and stood staring after the curate as he all but ran to overtake the swiftly gliding figure .
Parsing [sent. 7230 len. 28]: The woman , ignorant that her pursuer was again upon her track , and hardly any longer knowing what she did , hurried blindly towards the churchyard .
Parsing [sent. 7231 len. 54]: Presently the curate relaxed his speed , hoping she would enter it , when he would have her in a fit place for the interview upon which he was , if possible , more determined than ever , now that he had gained , so unexpectedly , such an absolute hold of her .
Parsing [sent. 7232 len. 24]: `` She must be Emmeline 's mother , '' he said to himself , '' -- fit mother for such a daughter . ''
Parsing [sent. 7233 len. 23]: The moment he caught sight of the visage lifted from its regard of the sleeping youth , he had suspected the fact .
Parsing [sent. 7234 len. 18]: He had not had time to analyze its expression , but there was something dreadful in it .
Parsing [sent. 7235 len. 8]: A bold question would determine the suspicion .
Parsing [sent. 7236 len. 16]: She entered the churchyard , saw the Abbey door open , and hastened to it .
Parsing [sent. 7237 len. 17]: She was in a state of bewilderment and terror that would have crazed a weaker woman .
Parsing [sent. 7238 len. 16]: In the porch she cast a glance behind her : there again was her pursuer !
Parsing [sent. 7239 len. 6]: She sprang into the church .
Parsing [sent. 7240 len. 12]: A woman was dusting a pew not far from the door .
Parsing [sent. 7241 len. 7]: `` Who is that coming ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7242 len. 15]: she asked , in a tone and with a mien that appalled Mrs. Jenkins .
Parsing [sent. 7243 len. 15]: She had but to stretch her neck a little to see through the porch .
Parsing [sent. 7244 len. 12]: `` Why , it be only the parson , ma'am ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7245 len. 3]: she answered .
Parsing [sent. 7246 len. 23]: `` Then I shall hide myself , over there , and you must tell him I went out by that other door .
Parsing [sent. 7247 len. 8]: Here 's a sovereign for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 7248 len. 56]: `` I thank you , ma'am , '' said Mrs. Jenkins , looking wistfully at the sovereign , which was a great sum of money to a sexton 's wife with children , then instantly going on with her dusting ; `` but it ai n't no use tryin ' of tricks with our parson .
Parsing [sent. 7249 len. 8]: HE ai n't one of your Mollies .
Parsing [sent. 7250 len. 31]: A man as do n't play no tricks with hisself , as I heerd a gentleman say , it ai n't no use tryin ' no tricks with HIM . ''
Parsing [sent. 7251 len. 9]: Almost while she spoke , the curate entered .
Parsing [sent. 7252 len. 15]: The suppliant drew herself up , and endeavoured to look both dignified and injured .
Parsing [sent. 7253 len. 14]: `` Would you oblige me by walking this way for a moment ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7254 len. 8]: he said , coming straight to her .
Parsing [sent. 7255 len. 26]: Without a word she followed him , a long way up the church , to the stone screen which divided the chancel from the nave .
Parsing [sent. 7256 len. 44]: There , in sight of Mrs. Jenkins , but so far off that she could not hear a word said , he asked her to take a seat on the steps that led up to the door in the centre of the screen .
Parsing [sent. 7257 len. 11]: Again she obeyed , and Wingfold sat down near her .
Parsing [sent. 7258 len. 8]: `` Are you Emmeline 's mother ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7259 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 7260 len. 26]: The gasp , the expression of eye and cheek , the whole startled response of the woman , revealed that he had struck the truth .
Parsing [sent. 7261 len. 6]: But she made no answer .
Parsing [sent. 7262 len. 25]: `` You had better be open with me , '' he said , `` for I mean to be very open with you . ''
Parsing [sent. 7263 len. 15]: She stared at him , but either could not , or would not speak .
Parsing [sent. 7264 len. 10]: Probably it was caution : she must hear more .
Parsing [sent. 7265 len. 25]: The curate was already excited , and I fear now got a little angry , for the woman was not pleasant to his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 7266 len. 38]: `` I want to tell you , '' he said , `` that the poor youth whom your daughter 's behaviour made a murderer of , -- '' She gave a cry , and turned like ashes .
Parsing [sent. 7267 len. 7]: The curate was ashamed of himself .
Parsing [sent. 7268 len. 16]: `` It seems cruel , '' he said , `` but it is the truth .
Parsing [sent. 7269 len. 17]: I say he is now dying -- will be gone after her in a few weeks .
Parsing [sent. 7270 len. 14]: The same blow killed both , only one has taken longer to die .
Parsing [sent. 7271 len. 11]: No end can be served by bringing him to justice .
Parsing [sent. 7272 len. 16]: Indeed if he were arrested , he would but die on the way to prison .
Parsing [sent. 7273 len. 24]: I have followed you to persuade you , if I can , to leave him to his fate and not urge it on .
Parsing [sent. 7274 len. 26]: If ever man was sorry , or suffered for his crime , -- '' `` And pray what is that to me , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7275 len. 15]: cried the avenging mother , who , finding herself entreated , straightway became arrogant .
Parsing [sent. 7276 len. 9]: `` Will it give me back my child ?
Parsing [sent. 7277 len. 30]: The villain took her precious life without giving her a moment to prepare for eternity , and you ask me -- her mother -- to let him go free !
Parsing [sent. 7278 len. 4]: I will not .
Parsing [sent. 7279 len. 12]: I have vowed vengeance , and I will have it . ''
Parsing [sent. 7280 len. 30]: `` Allow me to say that if you die in that spirit , you will be far worse prepared for eternity than I trust your poor daughter was . ''
Parsing [sent. 7281 len. 7]: `` What is that to you ?
Parsing [sent. 7282 len. 13]: If I choose to run the risk , it is my business .
Parsing [sent. 7283 len. 20]: I tell you it shall not be my fault if the wretch is not brought to the gallows . ''
Parsing [sent. 7284 len. 10]: `` But he can not live to reach it .
Parsing [sent. 7285 len. 13]: The necessary preliminaries would waste all that is left of his life .
Parsing [sent. 7286 len. 17]: I only ask of you to let him die in what peace is possible to him .
Parsing [sent. 7287 len. 9]: We must forgive our enemies , you know .
Parsing [sent. 7288 len. 10]: But indeed he is no enemy of yours . ''
Parsing [sent. 7289 len. 6]: `` No enemy of mine !
Parsing [sent. 7290 len. 11]: The man who murdered my child no enemy of mine !
Parsing [sent. 7291 len. 12]: I am his enemy then , and that he shall find .
Parsing [sent. 7292 len. 32]: If I can not bring him to the gallows , I can at least make every man and woman in the country point the finger of scorn and hatred at him .
Parsing [sent. 7293 len. 12]: I can bring him and all his to disgrace and ruin .
Parsing [sent. 7294 len. 4]: Their pride indeed !
Parsing [sent. 7295 len. 19]: They were far too grand to visit me , but not to send a murderer into my family .
Parsing [sent. 7296 len. 12]: I am in my rights , and I will have justice .
Parsing [sent. 7297 len. 14]: We shall see if they are too grand to have a nephew hung !
Parsing [sent. 7298 len. 5]: My poor lovely innocent !
Parsing [sent. 7299 len. 9]: I will have justice on the foul villain .
Parsing [sent. 7300 len. 7]: Cringing shall not turn me . ''
Parsing [sent. 7301 len. 10]: Her lips were white , and her teeth set .
Parsing [sent. 7302 len. 31]: She rose with the slow movement of one whose intent , if it had blossomed in passion , was yet rooted in determination , and turned to leave the church .
Parsing [sent. 7303 len. 31]: `` It might hamper your proceedings a little , '' said Wingfold , `` if in the meantime a charge of bigamy were brought against yourself , MRS. DREW ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7304 len. 19]: Her back was towards the curate , and for a moment she stood like another pillar of salt .
Parsing [sent. 7305 len. 17]: Then she began to tremble , and laid hold of the carved top of a bench .
Parsing [sent. 7306 len. 22]: But her strength failed her completely ; she sank on her knees and fell on the floor with a deep moan .
Parsing [sent. 7307 len. 11]: The curate called Mrs. Jenkins and sent her for water .
Parsing [sent. 7308 len. 9]: With some difficulty they brought her to herself .
Parsing [sent. 7309 len. 27]: She rose , shuddered , drew her shawl about her , and said to the woman , `` I am sorry to give so much trouble .
Parsing [sent. 7310 len. 10]: When does the next train start for London ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7311 len. 10]: `` Within an hour , '' answered the curate .
Parsing [sent. 7312 len. 10]: `` I will see you safe to it . ''
Parsing [sent. 7313 len. 10]: `` Excuse me ; I prefer going alone . ''
Parsing [sent. 7314 len. 8]: `` That I can not permit . ''
Parsing [sent. 7315 len. 10]: `` I must go to my lodgings first . ''
Parsing [sent. 7316 len. 8]: `` I will go with you . ''
Parsing [sent. 7317 len. 21]: She cast on him a look of questioning hate , yielded , and laid two fingers on his offered arm .
Parsing [sent. 7318 len. 20]: They walked out of the church together and to the cottage where , for privacy , she had lodged .
Parsing [sent. 7319 len. 26]: There he left her for half an hour , and , yielding to her own necessities and not his entreaties , she took some refreshment .
Parsing [sent. 7320 len. 30]: In the glowing sullenness of foiled revenge , the smoke of which was crossed every now and then by a flash of hate , she sat until he returned .
Parsing [sent. 7321 len. 30]: `` Before I go with you to the train , '' said the curate , re-entering , `` you must give me your word to leave young Lingard unmolested .
Parsing [sent. 7322 len. 27]: I know my friend Mr. Drew has no desire to trouble you , but I am equally confident that he will do whatever I ask him .
Parsing [sent. 7323 len. 20]: If you will not promise me , from the moment you get into the train you shall be watched .
Parsing [sent. 7324 len. 6]: -- Do you promise ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7325 len. 34]: She was silent , with cold gleaming eyes , for a time , then said , `` How am I to know that this is not a trick to save his life ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7326 len. 12]: `` You saw him ; you could see he is dying .
Parsing [sent. 7327 len. 13]: I tell you I do not think he can live a month .
Parsing [sent. 7328 len. 7]: His disease is making rapid progress .
Parsing [sent. 7329 len. 12]: He must go with the first of the cold weather . ''
Parsing [sent. 7330 len. 7]: She could not help believing him .
Parsing [sent. 7331 len. 8]: `` I promise , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 7332 len. 22]: `` But you are cruel to compel a mother to forgive the villain that stabbed her daughter to the heart . ''
Parsing [sent. 7333 len. 36]: `` If the poor lad were not dying , I should see that he gave himself up , as indeed he set out to do some weeks ago , but was frustrated by his friends .
Parsing [sent. 7334 len. 8]: He is dying for love of her .
Parsing [sent. 7335 len. 8]: I believe I say so with truth .
Parsing [sent. 7336 len. 21]: Pity and love and remorse and horror of his deed have brought him to the state you saw him in .
Parsing [sent. 7337 len. 115]: To be honest with you , he might have got better enough to be tortured for a while in a madhouse , for no jury would have brought him in anything but insane at the time , with the evidence that would have been adduced ; but in his anxiety to see me one day -- for his friends at that time did not favour my visits , because I encouraged him to surrender -- he got out of the house alone to come to me , but fainted in the churchyard , and lay on the damp earth for the better part of an hour , I fancy , before we found him .
Parsing [sent. 7338 len. 21]: Still , had it not been for the state of his mind , he might have got over that too .
Parsing [sent. 7339 len. 14]: -- As you hope to be forgiven , you must forgive him . ''
Parsing [sent. 7340 len. 8]: He held out his hand to her .
Parsing [sent. 7341 len. 11]: She was a little softened , and gave him hers .
Parsing [sent. 7342 len. 41]: `` Allow me one word more , '' said the curate , `` and then we shall go : Our crimes are friends that will hunt us either to the bosom of God , or the pit of hell . ''
Parsing [sent. 7343 len. 13]: She looked down , but her look was still sullen and proud .
Parsing [sent. 7344 len. 25]: The curate rose , took up her bag , went with her to the station , got her ticket , and saw her off .
Parsing [sent. 7345 len. 14]: Then he hastened back to Drew , and told him the whole story .
Parsing [sent. 7346 len. 5]: `` Poor woman ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7347 len. 5]: said her husband . ''
Parsing [sent. 7348 len. 17]: -- But God only knows how much _ I _ am to blame for all this .
Parsing [sent. 7349 len. 27]: If I had behaved better to her she might never have left me , and your poor young friend would now be well and happy . ''
Parsing [sent. 7350 len. 18]: `` Perhaps consuming his soul to a cinder with that odious drug , '' said Wingfold . ''
Parsing [sent. 7351 len. 57]: 'T is true , as Edgar in King Lear says : The gods are just , and of our pleasant vices Make instruments to plague us ; but he takes our sins on himself , and while he drives them out of us with a whip of scorpions he will yet make them work his ends .
Parsing [sent. 7352 len. 45]: He defeats our sins , makes them prisoners , forces them into the service of good , chains them like galley-slaves to the rowing-benches of the gospel-ship , or sets them like ugly gurgoyles or corbels or brackets in the walls of his temples .
Parsing [sent. 7353 len. 9]: -- No , that last figure I retract .
Parsing [sent. 7354 len. 6]: I do n't like it .
Parsing [sent. 7355 len. 6]: It implies their continuance . ''
Parsing [sent. 7356 len. 5]: `` Poor woman ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7357 len. 15]: said Mr. Drew again , who for once had been inattentive to the curate .
Parsing [sent. 7358 len. 3]: `` Well !
Parsing [sent. 7359 len. 7]: she is sorely punished too . ''
Parsing [sent. 7360 len. 23]: `` She will be worse punished yet , '' said the curate , `` if I can read the signs of character .
Parsing [sent. 7361 len. 20]: SHE is not repentant yet -- though I did spy in her just once a touch of softening . ''
Parsing [sent. 7362 len. 28]: `` It is an awful retribution , '' said the draper , `` and I may yet have to bear my share -- God help me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7363 len. 21]: `` I suspect it is the weight of her own crime that makes her so fierce to avenge her daughter .
Parsing [sent. 7364 len. 14]: I doubt if anything makes one so unforgiving as guilt unrepented of . ''
Parsing [sent. 7365 len. 21]: `` Well , I must try to find out where she is , and keep an eye upon her . ''
Parsing [sent. 7366 len. 7]: `` That will be easy enough .
Parsing [sent. 7367 len. 4]: But why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7368 len. 32]: `` Because , if , as you think , there is more evil in store for her , I may yet have it in my power to do her some service .
Parsing [sent. 7369 len. 23]: -- I wonder if Mr. Polwarth would call that DIVINE SERVICE , '' he added , with one of his sunny smiles .
Parsing [sent. 7370 len. 10]: `` Indeed he would , '' answered the curate .
Parsing [sent. 7371 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXII .
Parsing [sent. 7372 len. 3]: THE BEDSIDE .
Parsing [sent. 7373 len. 16]: George Bascombe , when he went to Paris , had no thought of deserting Helen .
Parsing [sent. 7374 len. 22]: But he had good ground for fearing that it might be ruinous both to Lingard and himself to undertake his defence .
Parsing [sent. 7375 len. 50]: From Paris he wrote often to Helen , and she replied -- not so often , yet often enough to satisfy him ; and as soon as she was convinced that Leopold could not recover , she let him know , whereupon he instantly began his preparations for returning .
Parsing [sent. 7376 len. 11]: Before he came , the weather had changed once more .
Parsing [sent. 7377 len. 18]: It was now cold , and the cold had begun at once to tell upon the invalid .
Parsing [sent. 7378 len. 26]: There are some natures to which cold , moral , spiritual , or physical , is lethal , and Lingard 's was of the class .
Parsing [sent. 7379 len. 70]: When the dying leaves began to shiver in the breath of the coming winter , the very brightness of the sun to look gleamy , and nature to put on the unfriendly aspect of a world not made for living in but for shutting out -- when all things took the turn of reminding man that his life lay not in them , Leopold began to shrink and withdraw .
Parsing [sent. 7380 len. 42]: He could not face the ghastly persistence of the winter , which would come , let all the souls of the summer-nations shrink and protest as they might ; let them creep shivering to Hades ; he would have his day .
Parsing [sent. 7381 len. 11]: His sufferings were now considerable , but he never complained .
Parsing [sent. 7382 len. 39]: Restless and fevered and sick at heart , it was yet more from the necessity of a lovely nature than from any virtue of will that he was so easy to nurse , accepting so readily all ministrations .
Parsing [sent. 7383 len. 37]: Never exacting and never refusing , he was always gently grateful , giving a sort of impression that he could have been far more thankful had he not known the object of the kindnesses so unworthy .
Parsing [sent. 7384 len. 50]: Next to Wingfold 's and his sister 's , the face he always welcomed most was that of the gate-keeper -- indeed I ought hardly to say NEXT to theirs ; for if the curate was to him as a brother , Polwarth was like a father in Christ .
Parsing [sent. 7385 len. 29]: He came every day , and every day , almost till that of his departure , Leopold had something to ask him about or something to tell him .
Parsing [sent. 7386 len. 11]: `` I am getting so stupid , Mr. Polwarth ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7387 len. 4]: he said once .
Parsing [sent. 7388 len. 6]: `` It troubles me much .
Parsing [sent. 7389 len. 10]: I do n't seem to care for anything now .
Parsing [sent. 7390 len. 27]: I do n't want to hear the New Testament : I would rather hear a child 's story -- something that did not want thinking about .
Parsing [sent. 7391 len. 10]: If I am not coughing , I am content .
Parsing [sent. 7392 len. 26]: I could lie for hours and hours and never think more than what goes creeping through my mind no faster than a canal in Holland .
Parsing [sent. 7393 len. 32]: When I am coughing , -- I do n't think about anything then either -- only long for the fit to be over and let me back again into Sleepy Hollow .
Parsing [sent. 7394 len. 11]: All my past life seems to be gone from me .
Parsing [sent. 7395 len. 7]: I do n't care about it .
Parsing [sent. 7396 len. 10]: Even my crime looks like something done ages ago .
Parsing [sent. 7397 len. 36]: I know it is mine , and I would rather it were not mine , but it is as if a great cloud had come and swept away the world in which it took place .
Parsing [sent. 7398 len. 15]: I am afraid sometimes that I am beginning not to care even about that .
Parsing [sent. 7399 len. 23]: I say to myself , I shall be sorry again by and by , but I ca n't think about it now .
Parsing [sent. 7400 len. 31]: I feel as if I had handed it over to God to lay down where I should find it again when I was able to think and be sorry . ''
Parsing [sent. 7401 len. 21]: This was a long utterance for him to make , but he had spoken slowly , and with frequent pauses .
Parsing [sent. 7402 len. 34]: Polwarth did not speak once , feeling that a dying man must be allowed to ease his mind after his own fashion , and take as much time to it as he pleased .
Parsing [sent. 7403 len. 20]: Helen and Wingfold both would have told him he must not tire himself , but that Polwarth never did .
Parsing [sent. 7404 len. 20]: The dying should not have their utterances checked , or the feeling of not having finished forced upon them .
Parsing [sent. 7405 len. 11]: They will always have plenty of the feeling without that .
Parsing [sent. 7406 len. 33]: A fit of coughing compelled him to break off , and when it was over , he lay panting and weary , but with his large eyes questioning the face of Polwarth .
Parsing [sent. 7407 len. 6]: Then the little man spoke .
Parsing [sent. 7408 len. 17]: `` He must give us every sort of opportunity for trusting him , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 7409 len. 17]: `` The one he now gives you , is this dulness that has come over you .
Parsing [sent. 7410 len. 22]: Trust him through it , submitting to it and yet trusting against it , and you get the good of it .
Parsing [sent. 7411 len. 67]: In your present state perhaps you can not even try to bring about by force of will any better state of feeling or higher intellectual condition ; but you can say to God something like this : `` See , Lord , I am dull and stupid , and care for nothing : take thou care of everything for me , heart and mind and all .
Parsing [sent. 7412 len. 6]: I leave all to thee .
Parsing [sent. 7413 len. 15]: Wilt thou not at length draw me out of this my frozen wintery state ?
Parsing [sent. 7414 len. 30]: Let me not shrink from fresh life and thought and duty , or be unready to come out of the shell of my sickness when thou sendest for me .
Parsing [sent. 7415 len. 5]: I wait thy will .
Parsing [sent. 7416 len. 25]: I wait even the light that I feel now as if I dared not encounter for weariness of body and faintness of spirit . ''
Parsing [sent. 7417 len. 4]: `` Ah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7418 len. 10]: cried Leopold , `` there you have touched it !
Parsing [sent. 7419 len. 11]: How can you know so well what I feel ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7420 len. 28]: `` Because I have often had to fight hard to keep death to his own province , and not let him cross over into my spirit . ''
Parsing [sent. 7421 len. 3]: `` Alas !
Parsing [sent. 7422 len. 15]: I am not fighting at all ; I am only letting things go . ''
Parsing [sent. 7423 len. 21]: `` You are fighting more than you know , I suspect , for you are enduring , and that patiently .
Parsing [sent. 7424 len. 64]: Suppose Jesus were to knock at the door now , and it was locked ; suppose you knew it was he , and there was no one in the room to open it for him ; suppose you were as weak as you are now , and seemed to care as little about him or anything else : what would you do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7425 len. 20]: Leopold looked half amazed , as if wondering what his friend could be driving at with such a question .
Parsing [sent. 7426 len. 14]: `` What else could I do but get up and open it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7427 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 7428 len. 17]: `` Would you not be tempted to lie still and wait till some one came . ''
Parsing [sent. 7429 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 7430 len. 45]: `` Would you not say in your heart , ` The Lord knows I am very weak , and I should catch cold , and the exertion would make me cough dreadfully , and he wo n't mind if I lie still ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 7431 len. 6]: `` That I would n't !
Parsing [sent. 7432 len. 9]: What should I care what came to me ?
Parsing [sent. 7433 len. 14]: What would it matter so long as I got one look at him !
Parsing [sent. 7434 len. 18]: Besides , if he did n't want me to get up , he would n't knock . ''
Parsing [sent. 7435 len. 30]: `` But suppose you knew that the moment you turned the key you would drop down , and when the Lord came in you would not see him . ''
Parsing [sent. 7436 len. 16]: `` I ca n't think where you want to take me , Mr. Polwarth ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7437 len. 4]: said the youth .
Parsing [sent. 7438 len. 23]: `` Even if I knew I should drop dead the moment I got out on the floor , what would it matter !
Parsing [sent. 7439 len. 20]: I should get to him the sooner then , and tell him why I did n't open the door .
Parsing [sent. 7440 len. 29]: Can you suppose for a moment I should let any care for this miserable body of mine come between my eyes and the face of my Lord ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7441 len. 23]: `` You see then that you do care about him a little , though a minute ago you did n't think it !
Parsing [sent. 7442 len. 20]: There are many feelings in us that are not able to get up stairs the moment we call them .
Parsing [sent. 7443 len. 35]: Be as dull and stupid as it pleases God to let you be , and trouble neither yourself nor him about that , only ask him to be with you all the same . ''
Parsing [sent. 7444 len. 54]: The little man dropped on his knees by the bedside , and said , `` O Lord Jesus , be near when it seems to us , as it seemed to thee once , that our Father has forsaken us , and gathered back to himself all the gifts he once gave us .
Parsing [sent. 7445 len. 41]: Even thou who wast mighty in death , didst need the presence of thy Father to make thee able to endure : forget not us the work of thy hands , yea , the labour of thy heart and spirit .
Parsing [sent. 7446 len. 23]: O remember that we are his offspring , neither accountable for our own being , nor able to comfort or strengthen ourselves .
Parsing [sent. 7447 len. 36]: If thou wert to leave us alone , we should cry out upon thee as on the mother who threw her babes to the wolves -- and there are no wolves able to terrify thee .
Parsing [sent. 7448 len. 3]: Ah Lord !
Parsing [sent. 7449 len. 25]: we know thou leavest us not , only in our weakness we would comfort our hearts with the music of the words of faith .
Parsing [sent. 7450 len. 40]: Thou canst not do other than care for us , Lord Christ , for whether we be glad or sorry , slow of heart or full of faith , all the same are we the children of thy Father .
Parsing [sent. 7451 len. 46]: He sent us here , and never asked us if we would ; therefore thou must be with us , and give us repentance and humility and love and faith , that we may indeed be the children of thy Father who is in heaven .
Parsing [sent. 7452 len. 3]: Amen . ''
Parsing [sent. 7453 len. 29]: While Polwarth was yet praying , the door had opened gently behind him , and Helen , not knowing that he was there , had entered with Bascombe .
Parsing [sent. 7454 len. 19]: He neither heard their entrance , nor saw the face of disgust that George made behind his back .
Parsing [sent. 7455 len. 11]: What was in Bascombe 's deepest soul who shall tell ?
Parsing [sent. 7456 len. 8]: Of that region he himself knew nothing .
Parsing [sent. 7457 len. 30]: It was a silent , holy place into which he had never yet entered -- therefore lonely and deserted as the top of Sinai after the cloud had departed .
Parsing [sent. 7458 len. 21]: No -- I will not say that : who knows what is where man can not or will not look ?
Parsing [sent. 7459 len. 20]: If George had sought there , perhaps he might have found traces of a presence not yet altogether vanished .
Parsing [sent. 7460 len. 32]: In what he called and imagined his deeepest soul , however , all he was now conscious of was a perfect loathing of the monstrous superstition so fitly embodied before him .
Parsing [sent. 7461 len. 45]: The prayer of the kneeling absurdity was to him an audacious mockery of the infrangible laws of Nature : this hulk of misshapen pottery actually presuming to believe that an invisible individual heard what he said because he crooked his hinges to say it !
Parsing [sent. 7462 len. 62]: It did not occur to George that the infrangible laws of Nature she had herself from the very first so agonizingly broken to the poor dwarf , she had been to him such a cruel step-mother , that he was in evil case indeed if he could find no father to give him fair play and a chance of the endurable .
Parsing [sent. 7463 len. 31]: Was he so much to blame if he felt the annihilation offered by such theorists as George , not altogether a satisfactory counterpoise either to its existence or its loss ?
Parsing [sent. 7464 len. 95]: If , even , he were to fancy in his trouble that the old fable of an elder brother , something more humble than grand handsome George Bascombe and more ready to help his little brothers and sisters , might be true , seeing that an old story is not necessarily a false one , and were to try after the hints it gave , surely in his condition such folly , however absurd to a man of George Bascombe 's endowments , might of the more gifted ephemeros be pardoned if not pitied .
Parsing [sent. 7465 len. 47]: Nor will I assert that he was altogether unaware of any admixture of the sad with the ludicrous when he saw the amorphous agglomerate of human shreds and patches kneeling by the bedside of the dying murderer , to pray some comfort into his passing soul .
Parsing [sent. 7466 len. 34]: But his `` gorge rose at the nonsense and stuff of it , '' while through Helen ran a cold shudder of disgust at the familiarity and irreverence of the little spiritual prig .
Parsing [sent. 7467 len. 53]: How many of the judgments we are told not to judge and yet do judge , must make the angels of the judging and the judged turn and look at each other and smile a sad smile , ere they set themselves to forget that which so sorely needs to be forgotten .
Parsing [sent. 7468 len. 11]: Polwarth rose from his knees unaware of a hostile presence .
Parsing [sent. 7469 len. 27]: `` Leopold , '' he said , taking his hand , `` I would gladly , if I might , walk with you through the shadow .
Parsing [sent. 7470 len. 11]: But the heart of all hearts will be with you .
Parsing [sent. 7471 len. 30]: Rest in your tent a little while , which is indeed the hollow of the Father 's hand turned over you , with your strong brother watching the door .
Parsing [sent. 7472 len. 29]: Your imagination can not go beyond the truth of him who is the Father of lights , or of him who is the Elder Brother of men . ''
Parsing [sent. 7473 len. 7]: Leopold answered only with his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 7474 len. 10]: Polwarth turned to go , and saw the on-lookers .
Parsing [sent. 7475 len. 18]: They stood between him and the door , but parted and made room for him to pass .
Parsing [sent. 7476 len. 3]: Neither spoke .
Parsing [sent. 7477 len. 49]: He made a bow first to one and then to the other , looking up in the face of each , unabashed by smile or scorn or blush of annoyance , but George took no notice , walking straight to the bed the moment the way was clear .
Parsing [sent. 7478 len. 28]: Helen 's conscience , however , or heart , smote her , and , returning his bow , she opened the door for her brother 's friend .
Parsing [sent. 7479 len. 9]: He thanked her , and went his way .
Parsing [sent. 7480 len. 6]: `` Poor dear fellow ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7481 len. 22]: said George kindly , and stroked the thin hand laid in his : `` can I do anything for you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7482 len. 38]: `` Nothing but be good to Helen when I am gone , and tell her now and then that I 'm not dead , but living in the hope of seeing her again one day before long .
Parsing [sent. 7483 len. 15]: She might forget sometimes -- not me , but that , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 7484 len. 29]: `` Yes , yes , I 'll see to it , '' answered George , in the evil tone of one who faithfully promises a child an impossibility .
Parsing [sent. 7485 len. 67]: Of course there was no more harm in lying to a man who was just on the verge of being a man no more , and becoming only an unpleasant mass of chemicals , which a whole ant-heap of little laws would presently be carrying outside the gates of the organic , than there had been in lying to him when he supposed him a madman .
Parsing [sent. 7486 len. 69]: Neither could anyone blame him for inconsistency ; for had he not always said in the goodness of his heart , that he would never disturb the faith of old people drawing nigh their end , because such no more possessed the needful elasticity of brain to accommodate themselves to the subversion of previous modes of feeling and thought , unavoidable to the adoption of his precious revelation .
Parsing [sent. 7487 len. 38]: Precious he did believe it , never having himself one of those visions of infinite hope , which , were his theory once proved as true as he imagined it , must then indeed vanish for ever .
Parsing [sent. 7488 len. 7]: `` Do you suffer much ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7489 len. 3]: asked George .
Parsing [sent. 7490 len. 8]: `` Yes -- a good deal . ''
Parsing [sent. 7491 len. 4]: `` Pain ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7492 len. 8]: `` Not so much ; -- sometimes .
Parsing [sent. 7493 len. 6]: The weakness is the worst .
Parsing [sent. 7494 len. 12]: But it does n't matter : God is with me . ''
Parsing [sent. 7495 len. 9]: `` What good does that do you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7496 len. 27]: asked George , forgetting himself , half in contempt , half in a curiosity which he would have called , and which perhaps was , scientific .
Parsing [sent. 7497 len. 27]: But Leopold took it in good faith , and answered , `` It sets it all right , and makes me able to be patient . ''
Parsing [sent. 7498 len. 18]: George laid down the hand he held , and turned sadly to Helen , but said nothing .
Parsing [sent. 7499 len. 6]: The next moment Wingfold entered .
Parsing [sent. 7500 len. 13]: Helen kissed the dying hand , and left the room with George .
Parsing [sent. 7501 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXIII .
Parsing [sent. 7502 len. 3]: THE GARDEN .
Parsing [sent. 7503 len. 18]: Tenderly he led her into the garden , and down the walks now bare of bordering flowers .
Parsing [sent. 7504 len. 34]: To Helen it looked like a graveyard ; the dry bushes were the memorials of the buried flowers , and the cypress and box trees rose like the larger monuments of shapely stone .
Parsing [sent. 7505 len. 31]: The day was a cold leaden one , that would have rained if it could , to get rid of the deadness at its heart , but no tears came .
Parsing [sent. 7506 len. 14]: To the summer-house they went , under the cedar , and sat down .
Parsing [sent. 7507 len. 6]: Neither spoke for some time .
Parsing [sent. 7508 len. 5]: `` Poor Leopold ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7509 len. 11]: said George at length , and took Helen 's hand .
Parsing [sent. 7510 len. 13]: She burst into tears , and again for some time neither spoke .
Parsing [sent. 7511 len. 10]: `` George , I ca n't bear it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7512 len. 5]: she said at length .
Parsing [sent. 7513 len. 10]: `` It is very sad , '' answered George .
Parsing [sent. 7514 len. 26]: `` But he had a happy life , I do n't doubt , up to -- to -- '' `` What does that matter now ?
Parsing [sent. 7515 len. 7]: It is all a horrible farce .
Parsing [sent. 7516 len. 18]: -- To begin so fair and lovely , and end so stormy and cold and miserable ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7517 len. 20]: George did not like to say what he thought , namely , that it was Leopold 's own doing .
Parsing [sent. 7518 len. 38]: He did not see that therein lay the deepest depth of the misery -- the thing that of all things needed help : all else might be borne ; the less that COULD be borne the better .
Parsing [sent. 7519 len. 9]: `` It IS horrible , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 7520 len. 7]: `` But what can be done ?
Parsing [sent. 7521 len. 13]: What 's done is done , and nobody can help it . ''
Parsing [sent. 7522 len. 13]: `` There should be somebody to help it , '' said Helen .
Parsing [sent. 7523 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 7524 len. 4]: Should be ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7525 len. 4]: said George . ''
Parsing [sent. 7526 len. 14]: -- Well , it 's a comfort it will soon be over ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7527 len. 5]: `` Is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7528 len. 6]: returned Helen almost sharply . ''
Parsing [sent. 7529 len. 20]: -- But he 's not your brother , and you do n't know what it is to lose him !
Parsing [sent. 7530 len. 13]: Oh , how desolate the world will be without my darling ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7531 len. 7]: And again her tears found way .
Parsing [sent. 7532 len. 26]: `` All that I can do to make up for the loss , dearest Helen , '' said George , -- `` Oh George ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7533 len. 14]: she cried , starting to her feet , `` is there NO hope ?
Parsing [sent. 7534 len. 29]: I do n't mean of his getting better -- that we do know the likelihoods of -- but is there no hope of SOME TIME seeing him again ?
Parsing [sent. 7535 len. 9]: We know so little about all of it !
Parsing [sent. 7536 len. 8]: MIGHT there not be some way ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7537 len. 21]: But George was too honest in himself , and too true to his principles , to pretend anything to Helen .
Parsing [sent. 7538 len. 10]: Hers was an altogether different case from Leopold 's .
Parsing [sent. 7539 len. 20]: Here was a young woman full of health and life and hope , with all her joys before her !
Parsing [sent. 7540 len. 38]: Many suns must set before her sun would go down , many pale moons look lovely in her eyes , ere came those that would mock her with withered memories -- a whole hortus siccus of passion-flowers .
Parsing [sent. 7541 len. 13]: Why should he lie to HER of a hope beyond the grave ?
Parsing [sent. 7542 len. 51]: Let the pleasures of the world be the dearer to her for the knowledge that they must so soon depart ; let love be the sweeter for the mournful thought that it is a thing of the summer , and that when the winter comes it shall be no more !
Parsing [sent. 7543 len. 7]: But perhaps George forgot one point .
Parsing [sent. 7544 len. 145]: I will allow that the insects of a day , dying in a moment of delightful fruition , are blessed ; but when the delicate Psyche , with her jewel-feathered wings , is beat about by a wind full of rain until she lies draggled in the dirt ; when there are no more flowers , or if there be , the joy of her hovering is over , and yet death comes but slowly ; when the mourners are going about the streets ere ever the silver cord is loosed ; when the past looks a mockery and the future a blank ; -- then perhaps , even to the correlatives of the most triumphant natural selection , it may not merely seem as if something were wrong somewhere , but even as if there ought to be somebody to set wrong right .
Parsing [sent. 7545 len. 23]: If Psyche should be so subdued to circumstance as to accept without question her supposed fate , then doubly woe for Psyche !
Parsing [sent. 7546 len. 22]: But if George could not lie , it was not necessary for him to speak the truth : silence was enough .
Parsing [sent. 7547 len. 10]: A moment of it was all Helen could endure .
Parsing [sent. 7548 len. 16]: She rose hastily , left the wintered summer-house , and walked back to the sick-chamber .
Parsing [sent. 7549 len. 31]: George followed a few paces behind , so far quenched that he did not overtake her to walk by her side , feeling he had no aid to offer her .
Parsing [sent. 7550 len. 76]: Doubtless he could have told her of help at hand , but it was help that must come , that could neither be given nor taken , would not come the sooner for any prayer , and indeed would not begin to exist until the worst should be over : the nearest George came to belief in a saving power , was to console himself with the thought that TIME would do everything for Helen .
Parsing [sent. 7551 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXIV .
Parsing [sent. 7552 len. 3]: THE DEPARTURE .
Parsing [sent. 7553 len. 23]: As Leopold slowly departed , he seemed to his sister to draw along with him all that was precious in her life .
Parsing [sent. 7554 len. 8]: She felt herself grow dull and indifferent .
Parsing [sent. 7555 len. 18]: It was to no purpose that she upbraided herself with heartlessness ; seemingly heartless her bosom remained .
Parsing [sent. 7556 len. 40]: It was not that her mind was occupied with anything else than her brother , or drew comfort from another source ; her feelings appeared to be dying with him who had drawn them forth more than any other .
Parsing [sent. 7557 len. 18]: The battle was ending without even the poor pomp and circumstance of torn banners and wailful music .
Parsing [sent. 7558 len. 10]: Leopold said very little during the last few days .
Parsing [sent. 7559 len. 22]: His fits , of coughing were more frequent , and in the pauses he had neither strength nor desire to speak .
Parsing [sent. 7560 len. 30]: When Helen came to his bedside , he would put out his hand to her , and she would sit down by him and hold it warm in hers .
Parsing [sent. 7561 len. 40]: The hand of his sister was the point of the planet from which , like his mount of ascension , the spirit of the youth took its departure ; -- when he let that go , he was gone .
Parsing [sent. 7562 len. 33]: But he died asleep , as so many do ; and fancied , I presume , that he was waking into his old life , when he woke into his new one .
Parsing [sent. 7563 len. 41]: Wingfold stood on the other side of the bed , with Polwarth by him , for so had the departing wished it , and although he made no sign , I can not but think he reaped some content therefrom .
Parsing [sent. 7564 len. 22]: While yet he lingered , one of Helen 's listless , straying glances was arrested by the countenance of the gate-keeper .
Parsing [sent. 7565 len. 34]: It was so still and so rapt that she thought he must be seeing within the veil , and regarding what things were awaiting her brother on the reverse of the two-sided wonder .
Parsing [sent. 7566 len. 6]: But it was not so .
Parsing [sent. 7567 len. 30]: Polwarth saw no more than she did : he was ONLY standing in the presence of him who is not the God of the dead but of the living .
Parsing [sent. 7568 len. 60]: Whatever lay in that Will was the life of whatever came of that Will , that is , of every creature , and no to that Will , to the face of the Father , he lifted , in his prayerful thought , the heart and mind and body of the youth now passing through the birth of death .
Parsing [sent. 7569 len. 57]: `` I know not , '' he would have said , had he been questioned concerning his spiritual attitude , `` how my prayer should for another work anything with the perfect Giver , but at least I will not leave my friend behind when I go into the presence of his Father and my Father .
Parsing [sent. 7570 len. 15]: And I believe there is something in it I can not yet see . ''
Parsing [sent. 7571 len. 8]: Wingfold 's anxiety was all for Helen .
Parsing [sent. 7572 len. 16]: He could do no more for Leopold , nor did he need more from man .
Parsing [sent. 7573 len. 39]: As to many of the things that puzzled them most , he was on his way to know more ; he would soon be in the heart of what seemed likely to remain a long secret to him .
Parsing [sent. 7574 len. 38]: But there was his sister , about to be left behind him without his hopes ; for her were dreary days at hand ; and the curate prayed the God of comfort and consolation to visit her .
Parsing [sent. 7575 len. 38]: Mrs. Ramshorn would now and then look in at the noiseless door of the chamber of death , but she rightly felt her presence was not desired , and though ready to help , did not enter .
Parsing [sent. 7576 len. 29]: Neither did George -- not from heartlessness , but that he judged it better to leave the priests of falsehood undisturbed in the exercise of their miserable office .
Parsing [sent. 7577 len. 15]: What did it matter how many comforting lies were told to a dying man ?
Parsing [sent. 7578 len. 5]: What COULD it matter ?
Parsing [sent. 7579 len. 39]: There was small danger of their foolish prayers and superstitious ceremonies evoking a deity from the well-ordered , self-evolved sphericity of interacting law , where not a pin-hole of failure afforded space out of which he might creep .
Parsing [sent. 7580 len. 52]: No more could they deprive the poor lad of the bliss of returning into the absolute nothingness whence he had crept -- to commit a horrible crime against immortal society , and creep back again , with a heart full of love and remorse and self-abhorrence , into the black abyss .
Parsing [sent. 7581 len. 17]: Therefore , why should he not let them tell their lies and utter their silly incantations ?
Parsing [sent. 7582 len. 42]: Aloof and unharmed he stood , safe on the shore , all ready to reach the rescuing hand to Helen , the moment she should turn her eyes to him , for the help she knew he had to give her .
Parsing [sent. 7583 len. 41]: Certainly , for her sake , he would rather she were not left unprotected to such subtle and insinuating influences ; but with the power of his mind upon her good sense , he had no fear of the result .
Parsing [sent. 7584 len. 38]: Not that he expected her to submit at once to the wholesome regimen and plain diet he must prescribe her : the soft hand of Time must first draw together the edges of her heart 's wound .
Parsing [sent. 7585 len. 50]: But the deadness of Helen 's feelings , the heartlessness because of which she cried out against herself , seemed , in a vague way , by herself unacknowledged yet felt , if not caused by , yet associated with some subtle radiation from the being of George Bascombe .
Parsing [sent. 7586 len. 66]: That very morning when he came into the breakfast-room so quietly that she had not heard him , and , looking up , saw him unexpectedly , he seemed for a moment , she could not tell why , the dull fountain of all the miserable feeling -- not of loss , but of no loss , which pressed her heart flat in her bosom .
Parsing [sent. 7587 len. 41]: The next moment she accused herself of the grossest injustice , attributing it to the sickness of soul which the shadow of death had wrought in her ; for was not George the only true friend she had ever had ?
Parsing [sent. 7588 len. 10]: If she lost him she must be lonely indeed !
Parsing [sent. 7589 len. 19]: -- The feeling lingered notwithstanding , and when she thought it dispelled , began to gather again immediately .
Parsing [sent. 7590 len. 13]: At the same time she shrunk from Wingfold as hard and unsympathetic .
Parsing [sent. 7591 len. 52]: True he had been most kind , even tender , to her brother , but to him he had taken a fancy , having found in him one whom he could work upon and fashion to his own liking : poor Poldie had never been one of the strongest of men .
Parsing [sent. 7592 len. 58]: But to her , whom he could not model after his own ideas , who required a reason for the thing anyone would have her believe -- to her he had shown the rough side of his nature , going farther than any gentleman ought , even if he was a clergyman , in criticizing her conduct .
Parsing [sent. 7593 len. 10]: He might well take example of her cousin George !
Parsing [sent. 7594 len. 19]: What a different sort of artillery HE had brought to bear upon the outstanding fortress of her convictions !
Parsing [sent. 7595 len. 57]: So would she say within herself , again and again , in different forms , not knowing how little of conviction there was in the conclusions she seemed to come to -- how much of old habit and gratitude on the one hand , and pride and resentment upon the other.-And there still was that feeling !
Parsing [sent. 7596 len. 7]: she could not drive it away .
Parsing [sent. 7597 len. 12]: It was like trying to disperse a fog with a fan .
Parsing [sent. 7598 len. 21]: The outside weather , although she was far past heeding that , was in harmony with her soul 's weather .
Parsing [sent. 7599 len. 20]: A dull dark-grey fog hung from the sky , and without much obscuring the earth altogether hid the sun .
Parsing [sent. 7600 len. 6]: The air was very cold .
Parsing [sent. 7601 len. 8]: There was neither joy nor hope anywhere .
Parsing [sent. 7602 len. 36]: The bushes were leafless and budless , the summer gone , the spring not worth hoping for , because it also would go : spring after spring came -- for nothing but to go again !
Parsing [sent. 7603 len. 20]: Things were so empty and wretched that pain and grief , almost fear itself , would have been welcome .
Parsing [sent. 7604 len. 24]: The world around her , yes , all her life , all herself , was but the cold dead body of a summer-world .
Parsing [sent. 7605 len. 11]: And Leopold was going to be buried with the summer .
Parsing [sent. 7606 len. 9]: His smiles had all gone with the flowers .
Parsing [sent. 7607 len. 16]: The weeds of his troubles were going also , for they would die with him .
Parsing [sent. 7608 len. 39]: But he would not know it and be glad , any more than she , who was left caring for neither summer nor winter , joy nor sorrow , love nor hate , the past nor the future .
Parsing [sent. 7609 len. 27]: Many such thoughts wandered hazily through her mind as she now sat holding the hand of him who was fast sleeping away from her into death .
Parsing [sent. 7610 len. 23]: Her eyes were fixed on the window through which he had entered that terrible night , but she saw nothing beyond it .
Parsing [sent. 7611 len. 26]: `` He is gone '' said Polwarth in a voice that sounded unknown to the ears of Helen , and as he spoke he kneeled .
Parsing [sent. 7612 len. 15]: She started up with a cry , and looked in her brother 's face .
Parsing [sent. 7613 len. 16]: She had never seen anyone die , and yet she saw that he was dead .
Parsing [sent. 7614 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXV .
Parsing [sent. 7615 len. 3]: THE SUNSET .
Parsing [sent. 7616 len. 26]: How the terrible time , terrible for its very dulness and insensibility , passed until it brought the funeral , Helen could not have told .
Parsing [sent. 7617 len. 28]: It seemed to her , as she looked back upon it , a bare blank , yet was the blank full of a waste weariness of heart .
Parsing [sent. 7618 len. 10]: The days were all one , outside and inside .
Parsing [sent. 7619 len. 20]: Her heart was but a lonely narrow bay to the sea of cold immovable fog that filled the world .
Parsing [sent. 7620 len. 13]: No one tried to help , no one indeed knew her trouble .
Parsing [sent. 7621 len. 31]: Everyone took it for grief at the loss of her brother , while to herself it was the oppression of a life that had not even the interest of pain .
Parsing [sent. 7622 len. 19]: The curate had of course called to inquire after her , but had not been invited to enter .
Parsing [sent. 7623 len. 14]: George had been everywhere with help , but had no word to speak .
Parsing [sent. 7624 len. 14]: The day of the funeral came , in thin fog and dull cold .
Parsing [sent. 7625 len. 5]: The few friends gathered .
Parsing [sent. 7626 len. 8]: The body was borne to the Abbey .
Parsing [sent. 7627 len. 92]: The curate received it at the gate in the name of the church -- which takes our children in its arms , and our bodies into its garden -- save indeed where her gardener is some foolish priest who knows not the heart of his mother , and will pick and choose among her dead ; -- the lovely words of the last-first of the apostles , were read ; and earth was given back to earth , to mingle with the rest of the stuff the great workman works withal .
Parsing [sent. 7628 len. 15]: Cold was Helen 's heart , cold her body , cold her very being .
Parsing [sent. 7629 len. 15]: The earth , the air , the mist , the very light was cold .
Parsing [sent. 7630 len. 10]: The past was cold , the future yet colder .
Parsing [sent. 7631 len. 23]: She would have grudged Leopold his lonely rest in the grave , but that she had not feeling enough even for that .
Parsing [sent. 7632 len. 36]: Her life seemed withering away from her , like an autumn flower in the frosts of winter ; and she , as if she had been but a flower , did not seem to care .
Parsing [sent. 7633 len. 17]: What was life worth , when it had not strength to desire even its own continuance ?
Parsing [sent. 7634 len. 83]: Heartless she returned from the grave , careless of George 's mute attentions , not even scornful of her aunt 's shallow wail over the uncertainty of life and all things human , -- so indifferent to the whole misery that she walked straight up to the room , hers once more , from which the body had just been carried , and which , for so many many weary weeks , had been the centre of loving pain , sometimes agony .
Parsing [sent. 7635 len. 12]: Once more she was at peace -- but what a peace !
Parsing [sent. 7636 len. 50]: She took off her cloak and bonnet , laid them on the bed , went to the window , sat down , and gazed , hardly seeing , out on the cold garden with its sodden earth , its leafless shrubs , and perennial trees of darkness and mourning .
Parsing [sent. 7637 len. 22]: The meadow lay beyond , and there she did see the red cow busily feeding , and was half-angry with her .
Parsing [sent. 7638 len. 13]: Beyond the meadow stood the trees , with the park behind them .
Parsing [sent. 7639 len. 24]: And yet further behind lay the hollow with the awful house in its bosom , its dismal haunted lake and its ruined garden .
Parsing [sent. 7640 len. 5]: But nothing moved her .
Parsing [sent. 7641 len. 18]: She could have walked over every room in that house without a single quaver of the praecordia .
Parsing [sent. 7642 len. 10]: Poldie was dead , but was it not well ?
Parsing [sent. 7643 len. 15]: Even if he had not been in trouble , what should his death matter ?
Parsing [sent. 7644 len. 17]: She would die soon herself and for ever : what did that or anything else matter ?
Parsing [sent. 7645 len. 55]: Might she but keep this dulness of spirit , and never more wake to weep foolish tears over an existence the whole upstanding broad-based fact of which was not worth one drop in the rivers of weeping that had been flowing ever since the joyless birth of this unconceived , ill-fated , unfathered world !
Parsing [sent. 7646 len. 21]: To the hour of death belonged jubilation and not mourning ; the hour of birth was the hour of sorrow .
Parsing [sent. 7647 len. 5]: Back to the darkness !
Parsing [sent. 7648 len. 24]: was the cry of a life whose very being was an injury , only there was no one to have done the injury .
Parsing [sent. 7649 len. 24]: Thus she sat until she was summoned to dinner -- early for the sake of the friends whose home lay at a distance .
Parsing [sent. 7650 len. 38]: She ate and drank and took her share in the talk as matter of course , believing all at the table would judge her a heartless creature , and careless of what they might think or say .
Parsing [sent. 7651 len. 14]: But they judged her more kindly and more truly than she judged herself .
Parsing [sent. 7652 len. 20]: They saw through her eyes the deeps whose upward ducts were choked with the frost of an unknown despair .
Parsing [sent. 7653 len. 46]: No sooner was she at liberty than again she sought her room , not consciously from love to her brother who had died there , but because the deadness of her heart chose a fitting loneliness : and again she seated herself at the window .
Parsing [sent. 7654 len. 23]: The dreary day was drawing to a close , and the night , drearier it could not be , was at hand .
Parsing [sent. 7655 len. 28]: The gray had grown darker , and she sat like one waiting for the night like a monster coming to claim its own and swallow her up .
Parsing [sent. 7656 len. 10]: Something -- was it an invasion of reviving light ?
Parsing [sent. 7657 len. 7]: caused her to lift her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 7658 len. 23]: Away , sideways from her window , in the west , the mist had cleared a little -- somewhere about the sun .
Parsing [sent. 7659 len. 6]: Thinner and thinner it grew .
Parsing [sent. 7660 len. 24]: No sun came forth : he was already down ; but a canopy of faint amber grew visible , stretched above his tomb .
Parsing [sent. 7661 len. 19]: It was the stuff of which sad smiles are made , not a thing that belonged to gladness .
Parsing [sent. 7662 len. 22]: But only he who has lost his sorrow without regaining his joy , can tell how near sorrow lieth to joy .
Parsing [sent. 7663 len. 23]: Who that has known the dull paths of listless no-feeling , would not have his sorrow back with all its attendant agonies ?
Parsing [sent. 7664 len. 32]: The pale amber spread , dilute with light , and beneath it lay the gray of the fog , and above it the dark blue of cloud -- not of sky .
Parsing [sent. 7665 len. 40]: The soul of it was so still , so resigned , so sad , so forsaken , that she who had thought her heart gone from her , suddenly felt its wells were filling , and soon they overflowed .
Parsing [sent. 7666 len. 3]: She wept .
Parsing [sent. 7667 len. 3]: At what ?
Parsing [sent. 7668 len. 6]: A colour in the sky !
Parsing [sent. 7669 len. 26]: Was there then a God that knew sadness -- and was that a banner of grief he hung forth to comfort the sorrowful with sympathy ?
Parsing [sent. 7670 len. 16]: Or was it but a godless colour which the heart varnished with its own grief ?
Parsing [sent. 7671 len. 37]: Or if the human heart came from nothing and was sad , why might not the aspects of nature come from nothing and be sad too -- wrought in harmony with the unutterable woe of humanity ?
Parsing [sent. 7672 len. 69]: Then either is man the constructive centre of the world , and its meanings are but his own face looking back upon him from the mirror of his own projected atmosphere , and comfort there is none ; or he is not the centre of the world , which yet carries in its forms and colours the aspects of his mind ; and then , horror of horrors !
Parsing [sent. 7673 len. 20]: is man the one conscious point and object of a vast derision -- insentient nature grinning at sentient man !
Parsing [sent. 7674 len. 45]: rose or saffron , his sky but mocks and makes mows at him ; while he himself is the worst mockery of all , being at once that which mocks and that which not only is mocked but writhes in agony under the mockery .
Parsing [sent. 7675 len. 11]: Such as Bascombe reply that they find it not so .
Parsing [sent. 7676 len. 15]: I answer -- For the best of reasons , that it is not so .
Parsing [sent. 7677 len. 50]: Helen 's doubts did not stay her weeping , as doubt generally does ; for the sky with its sweet sadness was before her , and deep in her heart a lake of tears , which , now that it had begun to flow , would not be stayed .
Parsing [sent. 7678 len. 47]: She knew not why she wept , knew not that it was the sympathy of that pale amber of sad resignation which brought her relief : but she wept and wept , until her heart began to stir , and her tears came cooler and freer .
Parsing [sent. 7679 len. 4]: `` Oh Poldie !
Parsing [sent. 7680 len. 5]: my own Poldie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7681 len. 61]: she cried at length , and fell upon her knees -- not-to worship the sky -- not to pray to Poldie , or even for Poldie -- not indeed to pray at all , so far as she knew ; yet I doubt if it was merely and only from the impulse of the old childish habit of saying prayers .
Parsing [sent. 7682 len. 8]: But in a moment she grew restless .
Parsing [sent. 7683 len. 5]: There was no Poldie !
Parsing [sent. 7684 len. 8]: She rose and walked about the room .
Parsing [sent. 7685 len. 16]: And he came back to her soul , her desolate brother , clothed , alas !
Parsing [sent. 7686 len. 31]: in the rags and tatters of all the unkind and unjust thoughts she had ever had concerning him , and wearing on his face the reflection of her worse deeds .
Parsing [sent. 7687 len. 46]: She had stood between him and the only poor remnant of peace , consolation , and hope that it was possible he should have ; and it was through the friends whom she had treated with such distance and uncordiality that he did receive it .
Parsing [sent. 7688 len. 40]: Then out rushed from the chamber of her memory the vision of the small dark nervous wild-looking Indian boy who gazed at her but for one questioning moment , then shot into her arms and nestled in her bosom .
Parsing [sent. 7689 len. 7]: How had she justified that faith ?
Parsing [sent. 7690 len. 52]: She had received , and sheltered , and shielded him , doubtless , and would have done so with her life , yet , when it came to the test , she had loved herself better than him , and would have doomed him to agony rather than herself to disgrace .
Parsing [sent. 7691 len. 3]: Oh Poldie !
Parsing [sent. 7692 len. 2]: Poldie !
Parsing [sent. 7693 len. 6]: But he could not hear !
Parsing [sent. 7694 len. 16]: Never , for evermore , should she utter to him word of sorrow or repentance !
Parsing [sent. 7695 len. 24]: never beg his forgiveness , or let him know that now she knew better , and had risen above such weakness and selfishness !
Parsing [sent. 7696 len. 10]: She stopped , and looked sadly from the window .
Parsing [sent. 7697 len. 21]: The sky was cloudless overhead , and the amber pall was fainter and clearer over the tomb of the sun .
Parsing [sent. 7698 len. 31]: She turned hastily to the bed where lay her cloak and bonnet , put them on with trembling hands , and went out by that same window into the garden .
Parsing [sent. 7699 len. 55]: She could not help a shudder as she stood in the dark passage unlocking the door in the sunk fence , but the next minute she was crossing the meadow through the cold frosty twilight air , now clear of its fog , and seeming somehow to comfort , uplift , and strengthen her .
Parsing [sent. 7700 len. 8]: The red cow was still feeding there .
Parsing [sent. 7701 len. 9]: She stopped and talked to her a little .
Parsing [sent. 7702 len. 69]: She seemed one of Poldie 's friends , and Poldie had come back to her heart if he might never more to her arms , and she was now on her way to one of his best friends , whom , as more worthy , he had loved even better than her , and whom she had not honoured as they deserved or as he must have desired .
Parsing [sent. 7703 len. 13]: To get near them , would be to get nearer to Poldie .
Parsing [sent. 7704 len. 29]: At least she would be with those whom he had loved , and who , she did not doubt , still loved him , believing him still alive .
Parsing [sent. 7705 len. 26]: She could not go to the curate , but she could go to the Polwarths ; no one would blame her for that-except indeed George .
Parsing [sent. 7706 len. 20]: But even George should not come between her and what mere show of communion with Poldie was left her !
Parsing [sent. 7707 len. 19]: She would keep her freedom -- would rather break with George than lose an atom of her liberty !
Parsing [sent. 7708 len. 14]: She would be no clay for his hands to mould after his pleasure !
Parsing [sent. 7709 len. 26]: She opened the door in the fence and entered the park , seeming to recover strength with every step she took towards Poldie 's friends .
Parsing [sent. 7710 len. 13]: It was almost dark when she stood at the lodge-door and knocked .
Parsing [sent. 7711 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXVI .
Parsing [sent. 7712 len. 4]: AN HONEST SPY .
Parsing [sent. 7713 len. 7]: No one answered Helen 's knock .
Parsing [sent. 7714 len. 10]: She repeated it , and still no answer came .
Parsing [sent. 7715 len. 21]: Her heart might have failed her , but that she heard voices : what if they were talking about Leopold ?
Parsing [sent. 7716 len. 29]: At length , after knocking four or five times , she heard the step as of a child coming down a stair ; but it passed the door .
Parsing [sent. 7717 len. 7]: Clearly no one had heard her .
Parsing [sent. 7718 len. 13]: She knocked yet again , and immediately it was opened by Rachel .
Parsing [sent. 7719 len. 63]: The pleasured surprise that shone up in her face when she saw who it was that stood without , was lovely to see , and Helen , on whose miserable isolation it came like a sunrise of humanity , took no counsel with pride , but , in simple gratitude for the voiceless yet eloquent welcome , bent down and kissed her .
Parsing [sent. 7720 len. 51]: The little arms were flung about her neck , and the kiss returned with such a gentle warmth and restrained sweetness as would have satisfied the most fastidious in the matter of salute -- to which class , however , Helen did not belong , for she seldom kissed anyone .
Parsing [sent. 7721 len. 39]: Then Rachel took her by the hand , and led her into the kitchen , placed a chair for her near the fire , and said , `` I AM sorry there is no fire in the parlour .
Parsing [sent. 7722 len. 9]: The gentlemen are in my uncle 's room .
Parsing [sent. 7723 len. 19]: Oh , Miss Lingard , I do wish you could have heard how they have been talking ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7724 len. 11]: `` Have they been saying anything about my brother ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7725 len. 3]: asked Helen .
Parsing [sent. 7726 len. 11]: `` It 's all about him , '' she replied .
Parsing [sent. 7727 len. 10]: `` May I ask who the gentlemen are ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7728 len. 4]: said Helen doubtfully .
Parsing [sent. 7729 len. 7]: `` Mr. Wingfold and Mr. Drew .
Parsing [sent. 7730 len. 6]: They are often here . ''
Parsing [sent. 7731 len. 14]: `` Is it -- do you mean Mr. Drew , the draper ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7732 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 7733 len. 10]: He is one of Mr. Wingfold 's best pupils .
Parsing [sent. 7734 len. 16]: He brought him to my uncle , and he has come often ever since . ''
Parsing [sent. 7735 len. 12]: `` I never heard that -- Mr. Wingfold -- took pupils .
Parsing [sent. 7736 len. 11]: -- I am afraid I do not quite understand you .
Parsing [sent. 7737 len. 42]: `` I would have said DISCIPLES , '' returned Rachel smiling ; `` but that has grown to feel such a sacred word -- as if it belonged only to the Master , that I did n't like to use it .
Parsing [sent. 7738 len. 37]: It would say best what I mean though ; for there are people in Glaston that are actually mending their ways because of Mr. Wingfold 's teaching , and Mr. Drew was the first of them .
Parsing [sent. 7739 len. 14]: It is long since such a thing was heard of in the Abbey .
Parsing [sent. 7740 len. 8]: It never was in my time . ''
Parsing [sent. 7741 len. 3]: Helen sighed .
Parsing [sent. 7742 len. 52]: She wished it had remained possible for her also to become one of Mr. Wingfold 's pupils , but how could she now when she had learned that what he had to teach was at best but a lovely phantasm , sprung of the seething together of the conscience and imagination .
Parsing [sent. 7743 len. 46]: George could give account of the whole matter : religion invariably excited the imagination and weakened the conscience ; -- witness the innumerable tales concerning Jesus invented in the first of the Christian centuries , and about this and that saint in those that followed !
Parsing [sent. 7744 len. 18]: Helen 's experience in Leopold 's case had certainly been different , but the other fact remained .
Parsing [sent. 7745 len. 12]: Alas , she could not be a pupil of Mr. Wingfold !
Parsing [sent. 7746 len. 10]: She could no longer deceive herself with such comfort .
Parsing [sent. 7747 len. 3]: And yet !
Parsing [sent. 7748 len. 14]: -- COME UNTO ME , AND _ I _ WILL GIVE YOU REST .
Parsing [sent. 7749 len. 13]: `` I do wish I could hear them , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 7750 len. 6]: `` And why not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7751 len. 3]: returned Rachel .
Parsing [sent. 7752 len. 15]: `` There is not one of them would not be glad to see you .
Parsing [sent. 7753 len. 5]: I know that . ''
Parsing [sent. 7754 len. 10]: `` I am afraid I should hinder their talk .
Parsing [sent. 7755 len. 13]: Would they speak just as freely as if I were not there ?
Parsing [sent. 7756 len. 48]: Not that I know why they should n't , '' she added ; `` only the presence of any stranger -- '' `` You are no stranger to Mr. Wingfold or my uncle , '' said Rachel , `` and I daresay you know Mr. Drew ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7757 len. 25]: `` To tell you the truth , Miss Polwarth , I have not behaved as I should either to your uncle or Mr. Wingfold .
Parsing [sent. 7758 len. 10]: I know it now that my brother is gone .
Parsing [sent. 7759 len. 7]: They were so good to him !
Parsing [sent. 7760 len. 14]: I feel now as if I had been possessed with an evil spirit .
Parsing [sent. 7761 len. 14]: I could not bear them to be more to him than I was .
Parsing [sent. 7762 len. 13]: Oh , how I should like to hear what they are saying !
Parsing [sent. 7763 len. 18]: I feel as if I should get a glimpse of Leopold -- almost , if I might .
Parsing [sent. 7764 len. 9]: But I could n't face them all together .
Parsing [sent. 7765 len. 9]: I could not go into the room . ''
Parsing [sent. 7766 len. 9]: Rachel was silent for a moment , thinking .
Parsing [sent. 7767 len. 17]: Then she said : `` I 'll tell you what then : there 's no occasion .
Parsing [sent. 7768 len. 22]: Between my uncle 's room and mine there 's a little closet , where you shall sit and hear every word .
Parsing [sent. 7769 len. 14]: Nothing will divide you from them but a few thin old boards . ''
Parsing [sent. 7770 len. 12]: `` That would hardly be honourable though -- would it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7771 len. 7]: `` I will answer for it .
Parsing [sent. 7772 len. 7]: I shall tell my uncle afterwards .
Parsing [sent. 7773 len. 14]: There may be cases where the motive makes the right or the wrong .
Parsing [sent. 7774 len. 13]: It 's not as if you were listening to find out secrets .
Parsing [sent. 7775 len. 24]: I shall be in the room , and that will be a connecting link , you know : they never turn me out .
Parsing [sent. 7776 len. 3]: Come now .
Parsing [sent. 7777 len. 11]: We do n't know what we may be losing . ''
Parsing [sent. 7778 len. 27]: The desire to hear Leopold 's best friends talk about him was strong in Helen , but her heart misgave her : was it not unbecoming ?
Parsing [sent. 7779 len. 11]: She would be in terror of discovery all the time .
Parsing [sent. 7780 len. 22]: In the middle of the stair , she drew Rachel back and whispered , `` I dare not do it . ''
Parsing [sent. 7781 len. 8]: `` Come on , '' said Rachel .
Parsing [sent. 7782 len. 10]: `` Hear what I shall say to them first .
Parsing [sent. 7783 len. 10]: After that you shall do as you please . ''
Parsing [sent. 7784 len. 21]: Evidently , so quick was her response , her thoughts had been going in the same direction as Helen 's .
Parsing [sent. 7785 len. 17]: `` Thank you for trusting me , '' she added , as Helen again followed her .
Parsing [sent. 7786 len. 18]: Arrived at the top , the one stood trembling , while the other went into the room .
Parsing [sent. 7787 len. 53]: `` Uncle , '' said Rachel , `` I have a friend in the house who is very anxious to hear you and our friends speak your minds to each other , but for reasons does not wish to appear : will you allow my friend to listen without being seen ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7788 len. 19]: `` Is it your wish , Rachel , or are you only conveying the request of another ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7789 len. 4]: asked her uncle .
Parsing [sent. 7790 len. 10]: `` It is my wish , '' answered Rachel .
Parsing [sent. 7791 len. 13]: `` I really desire it -- if you do not mind . ''
Parsing [sent. 7792 len. 10]: She looked from one to another as she spoke .
Parsing [sent. 7793 len. 10]: The curate and the draper indicated a full acquiescence .
Parsing [sent. 7794 len. 13]: `` Do you know quite what you are about , Rachel ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7795 len. 3]: asked Polwarth .
Parsing [sent. 7796 len. 9]: `` Perfectly , uncle , '' she answered .
Parsing [sent. 7797 len. 21]: `` There is no reason why you should not talk as freely as if you were talking only to me .
Parsing [sent. 7798 len. 24]: I will put my friend in the closet , and you need never think that anyone is in the house but ourselves . ''
Parsing [sent. 7799 len. 17]: `` Then I have no more to say , '' returned her uncle with a smile .
Parsing [sent. 7800 len. 16]: `` Your FRIEND , whoever he or she may be , is heartily welcome . ''
Parsing [sent. 7801 len. 35]: Rachel rejoined Helen , who had already drawn nearer to the door of the closet , and now seated herself right willingly in its shelter , amidst an atmosphere odorous of apples and herbs .
Parsing [sent. 7802 len. 10]: Already the talk was going on just as before .
Parsing [sent. 7803 len. 37]: At first each of the talkers did now and then remember there was a listener unseen but found , when the conversation came to a close , that he had for a long time forgotten it .
Parsing [sent. 7804 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXVII .
Parsing [sent. 7805 len. 39]: WHAT HELEN HEARD , Although satisfied that , after what Rachel had said to the men , there could be no impropriety in her making use of the privilege granted her , Helen felt oddly uncomfortable at first .
Parsing [sent. 7806 len. 36]: But soon the fancy came , that she was listening at the door of the other world to catch news of her Leopold , and that made her forget herself and put her at peace .
Parsing [sent. 7807 len. 14]: For some time , however , the conversation was absolutely unintelligible to her .
Parsing [sent. 7808 len. 58]: She understood the words and phrases , and even some of the sentences , but as she had no clue to their drift , the effort to understand was like attempting to realize the span of a rainbow from a foot or two of it appearing now and then in different parts and vanishing again at once .
Parsing [sent. 7809 len. 23]: It was chiefly Polwarth , often Wingfold , and now and then Drew that spoke , Rachel contributing only an occasional word .
Parsing [sent. 7810 len. 12]: At length broke something of a dawn over the seeming chaos .
Parsing [sent. 7811 len. 17]: The words from which the light that first reached Helen flowed , were the draper 's .
Parsing [sent. 7812 len. 46]: `` I ca n't think , for all that , '' he said , `` why , if there be life beyond the grave , and most sincerely I trust there is -- I do n't see why we should know so little about it .
Parsing [sent. 7813 len. 6]: Confess now , Mr. Polwarth !
Parsing [sent. 7814 len. 5]: -- Mr. Wingfold ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7815 len. 58]: he said appealingly , '' -- does it not seem strange that , if our dearest friends go on living somewhere else , they should , the moment they cease to breathe , pass away from us utterly -- so utterly that from that moment neither hint nor trace nor sign of their existence ever reaches us ?
Parsing [sent. 7816 len. 97]: Nature , the Bible , God himself says nothing about how they exist or where they are , or why they are so silent -- cruelly silent if it be in their power to speak , -- therefore , they can not ; and here we are left not only with aching hearts but wavering faith , not knowing whither to turn to escape the stare of the awful blank , that seems in the very intensity of its silence to shout in our ears that we are but dust and return to the dust ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7817 len. 24]: The gate-keeper and curate interchanged a pleased look of surprise at the draper 's eloquence , but Polwarth instantly took up his answer .
Parsing [sent. 7818 len. 22]: `` I grant you it would be strange indeed if there were no good reason for it , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 7819 len. 10]: `` Then do you say , '' asked Wingfold .
Parsing [sent. 7820 len. 40]: `` that until we see , discover , or devise some good reason for the darkness that overhangs it , we are at liberty to remain in doubt as to whether there be any life within the cloud ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7821 len. 68]: `` I would say so , '' answered Polwarth , `` were it not that we have the story of Jesus , which , if we accept it , is surely enough to satisfy us both as to the thing itself , and as to the existence of a good reason , whether we have found one or not , for the mystery that overshadows it . ''
Parsing [sent. 7822 len. 19]: `` Still I presume we are not forbidden to seek such a reason , '' said the curate .
Parsing [sent. 7823 len. 14]: The draper was glancing from the one to the other with evident anxiety .
Parsing [sent. 7824 len. 9]: `` Certainly not , '' returned the gate-keeper .
Parsing [sent. 7825 len. 30]: `` For what else is our imagination given us but the discovery of good reasons that are , or the invention of good reasons that may perhaps be ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7826 len. 41]: `` Can you then imagine any good reason , '' said Drew , `` why we should be kept in such absolute ignorance of everything that befalls the parted spirit from the moment it quits its house with us ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7827 len. 11]: `` I think I know one , '' answered Polwarth .
Parsing [sent. 7828 len. 61]: `` I have sometimes fancied it might be because no true idea of their condition could possibly be grasped by those who remain in the tabernacle of the body ; that to know their state it is necessary that we also should be clothed in our new bodies , which are to the old as a house to a tent .
Parsing [sent. 7829 len. 37]: I doubt if we have any words in which the new facts could be imparted to our knowledge , the facts themselves being beyond the reach of any senses whereof we are now in actual possession .
Parsing [sent. 7830 len. 56]: I expect to find my new body provided with new , I mean OTHER senses beyond what I now possess : many more may be required to bring us into relation with all the facts in himself which God may have shadowed forth in properties , as we say , of what we call matter .
Parsing [sent. 7831 len. 39]: The spaces all around us , even to those betwixt star and star , may be the home of the multitudes of the heavenly host , yet seemingly empty to all who have but our provision of senses .
Parsing [sent. 7832 len. 13]: But I do not care to dwell upon that kind of speculation .
Parsing [sent. 7833 len. 49]: It belongs to a lower region , upon which I grudge to expend interest while the far loftier one invites me , where , if I gather not the special barley of which I am in search , I am sure to come upon the finest of wheat .
Parsing [sent. 7834 len. 97]: -- Well , then , for my reason : There are a thousand individual events in the course of every man 's life , by which God takes a hold of him -- a thousand breaches by which he would and does enter , little as the man may know it ; but there is one universal and unchanging grasp he keeps upon the race , yet not as the race , for the grasp is upon every solitary single individual that has a part in it : that grasp is -- death in its mystery .
Parsing [sent. 7835 len. 42]: To whom can the man who is about to die in absolute loneliness and go he can not tell whither , flee for refuge from the doubts and fears that assail him , but to the Father of his being ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7836 len. 45]: `` But , '' said Drew , `` I can not see what harm would come of letting us know a little -- as much at least as might serve to assure us that there was more of SOMETHING on the other side . ''
Parsing [sent. 7837 len. 55]: `` Just this , '' returned Polwarth , `` that , their fears allayed , their hopes encouraged from any lower quarter , men would , as usual , turn away from the fountain to the cistern of life , from the ever fresh original creative Love to that drawn off and shut in .
Parsing [sent. 7838 len. 86]: That there are thousands who would forget God if they could but be assured of such a tolerable state of things beyond the grave as even this wherein we now live , is plainly to be anticipated from the fact that the doubts of so many in respect of religion concentrate themselves now-a-days upon the question whether there is any life beyond the grave ; a question which , although no doubt nearly associated with religion , -- as what question worth asking is not ?
Parsing [sent. 7839 len. 10]: -- does not immediately belong to religion at all .
Parsing [sent. 7840 len. 19]: Satisfy such people , if you can , that they shall live , and what have they gained ?
Parsing [sent. 7841 len. 23]: A little comfort perhaps -- but a comfort not from the highest source , and possibly gained too soon for their well-being .
Parsing [sent. 7842 len. 13]: Does it bring them any nearer to God than they were before ?
Parsing [sent. 7843 len. 12]: Is he filling one cranny more of their hearts in consequence ?
Parsing [sent. 7844 len. 22]: Their assurance of immortality has not come from a knowledge of him , and without him it is worse than worthless .
Parsing [sent. 7845 len. 14]: Little indeed has been gained , and that with the loss of much .
Parsing [sent. 7846 len. 38]: The word applies here which our Lord in his parable puts into the mouth of Abraham : If they hear not Moses and the prophets , neither will they be persuaded though one rose from the dead .
Parsing [sent. 7847 len. 50]: He does not say they would not believe in a future state though one rose from the dead -- although most likely they would soon persuade themselves that the apparition after all was only an illusion -- -LSB- Footnote : See Lynch 's admirable sermon on this subject . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 7848 len. 34]: but that they would not be persuaded to repent , though one rose from the dead ; and without that , what great matter whether they believed in a future state or not ?
Parsing [sent. 7849 len. 12]: It would only be the worse for them if they did .
Parsing [sent. 7850 len. 5]: No , Mr. Drew !
Parsing [sent. 7851 len. 42]: I repeat , it is not a belief in immortality that will deliver a man from the woes of humanity , but faith in the God of life , the father of lights , the God of all consolation and comfort .
Parsing [sent. 7852 len. 37]: Believing in him , a man can leave his friends , and their and his own immortality , with everything else -- even his and their love and perfection , with utter confidence in his hands .
Parsing [sent. 7853 len. 15]: Until we have the life in us , we shall never be at peace .
Parsing [sent. 7854 len. 29]: The living God dwelling in the heart he has made , and glorifying it by inmost speech with himself -- that is life , assurance , and safety .
Parsing [sent. 7855 len. 9]: Nothing less is or can be such . ''
Parsing [sent. 7856 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXVIII .
Parsing [sent. 7857 len. 37]: WHAT HELEN HEARD MORE `` A word you dropped the other day , '' said the curate , `` set me thinking of the note-worthy fact that belief in God and belief in immortality cease together .
Parsing [sent. 7858 len. 10]: But I do not see the logic of it .
Parsing [sent. 7859 len. 17]: If we are here without God , why may we not go on there without God ?
Parsing [sent. 7860 len. 16]: I marvel that I have heard of no one taking up and advocating the view .
Parsing [sent. 7861 len. 39]: What a grand discovery it would be for some people -- that not only was there no God to interfere with them , and insist on their becoming something worth being , but that they were immortal notwithstanding !
Parsing [sent. 7862 len. 38]: that death was only the passage of another birth into a condition of enlarged capacity for such bliss as they enjoyed here , but more exalted in degree , perhaps in kind , and altogether preferable . ''
Parsing [sent. 7863 len. 20]: `` I know one to whom the thought would not have been a new one , '' said Polwarth .
Parsing [sent. 7864 len. 19]: `` Have you not come upon a passage in my brother 's manuscript involving the very idea ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7865 len. 4]: `` Not yet .
Parsing [sent. 7866 len. 11]: I read very slowly and pick up all the crumbs .
Parsing [sent. 7867 len. 9]: I wish we had had the book here .
Parsing [sent. 7868 len. 15]: I should have so much liked to hear you read from it again . ''
Parsing [sent. 7869 len. 9]: The gate-keeper rose and went to his cabinet .
Parsing [sent. 7870 len. 11]: `` The wish is easily gratified , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 7871 len. 26]: `` I made a copy of it , -- partly for security , partly that I might thoroughly enter into my brother 's thoughts . ''
Parsing [sent. 7872 len. 14]: `` I wonder almost you lend the original then , '' said Wingfold .
Parsing [sent. 7873 len. 23]: `` I certainly could not lend the copy to any man I could not trust with the original , '' answered Polwarth .
Parsing [sent. 7874 len. 9]: `` But I never lent either before . ''
Parsing [sent. 7875 len. 11]: -- He was turning over the leaves as he spoke .
Parsing [sent. 7876 len. 38]: -- `` The passage , '' he went on , `` besides for its own worth , is precious to me as showing how , through all his madness , his thoughts haunted the gates of wisdom .
Parsing [sent. 7877 len. 3]: -- Ah !
Parsing [sent. 7878 len. 5]: here it is ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7879 len. 25]: ` About this time I had another strange vision , whether in the body or out of the body , I can not tell .
Parsing [sent. 7880 len. 16]: I thought , as oftener than once before , that at length I was dying .
Parsing [sent. 7881 len. 57]: And it seemed to me that I did die , and awake to the consciousness of a blessed freedom from the coarser and more ponderous outer dress I had hitherto worn , being now clad only in what had been up to this time an inner garment , and was a far more closely fitting one .
Parsing [sent. 7882 len. 86]: The first delight of which I was aware was coolness -- a coolness that hurt me not -- the coolness as of a dewy summer eve , in which a soft friendly wind is blowing ; and the coolness was that of perfect well-being , of the health that cometh after fever , when a sound sleep hath divided it away and built a rampart between ; the coolness of undoubted truth , and of love that has surmounted passion and is tenfold love . '
Parsing [sent. 7883 len. 35]: `` He goes on to give further and fuller account of his sensations , -- ventures even on the anticipated futility of an attempt to convey a notion of one of his new senses .
Parsing [sent. 7884 len. 13]: I leave all that for your own reading , Mr. Wingfold . ''
Parsing [sent. 7885 len. 6]: ` But where was I ?
Parsing [sent. 7886 len. 6]: That I could not tell .
Parsing [sent. 7887 len. 19]: I am here was all I could say ; but then what more could I ever have said ?
Parsing [sent. 7888 len. 65]: -- Gradually my sight came to me , or the light of the country arose , I could not tell which , and behold , I was in the midst of a paradise , gorgeous yet gracious , to describe which I find no words in the halting tongues of earth , and I know something of them all , most of them well .
Parsing [sent. 7889 len. 55]: If I say a purple sea was breaking in light on an emerald shore , the moment the words are written , I see them coarse and crude as a boy 's first attempt at landscape ; yet are there no better wherewith to tell what first filled my eyes with heavenly delight . ''
Parsing [sent. 7890 len. 12]: ` The inhabitants were many , but nowhere were they crowded .
Parsing [sent. 7891 len. 18]: There was room in abundance , and wild places seemed to be held sacred for solitude . '
Parsing [sent. 7892 len. 30]: `` I am only picking up a sentence here and there , as I hasten to the particular point , '' said Polwarth , looking down the page . ''
Parsing [sent. 7893 len. 5]: ` But the flowers !
Parsing [sent. 7894 len. 4]: and the birds !
Parsing [sent. 7895 len. 9]: and above all the beauty of the people !
Parsing [sent. 7896 len. 6]: And they dwelt in harmony .
Parsing [sent. 7897 len. 26]: Yet on their foreheads lay as it seemed a faint mist , or as it were the first of a cloud of coming disquiet . ''
Parsing [sent. 7898 len. 29]: ` And I prayed him , Tell me , sir , whither shall I go to find God and say unto him , Lo , here I am !
Parsing [sent. 7899 len. 18]: And he answered and said to me , Sir , I but dimly know what thou meanest .
Parsing [sent. 7900 len. 3]: Say further .
Parsing [sent. 7901 len. 12]: And I stood for an hour , even as one astonied .
Parsing [sent. 7902 len. 27]: Then said I , All my long life on the world whence I came , I did look to find God when death should take me .
Parsing [sent. 7903 len. 41]: But lo , now -- And with that my heart smote me , for in my former life I had oftentimes fallen into unbelief and denied God : was this now my punishment -- that I should never find him ?
Parsing [sent. 7904 len. 15]: And my heart grew cold in my body , and the blood curdled therein .
Parsing [sent. 7905 len. 117]: Then the man answered and said , It is true that in generations past , for so I read in our ancient books , men did believe in one above them and in them , who had wrought them to that they were , and was working them to better still ; but whether it be that we have now gained that better , and there is nothing higher unto which we may look , therefore no need of the high one , I know not , but truly we have long ceased so to believe , and have learned that , as things are , so they have been , and so they shall be .
Parsing [sent. 7906 len. 39]: Then fell as it were a cold stone into the core of my heart , and I questioned him no farther , for I bore death in my heart , even as a woman carrieth her unborn child .
Parsing [sent. 7907 len. 3]: No God !
Parsing [sent. 7908 len. 16]: I cried , and sped away into a solitude and shrieked aloud , No God !
Parsing [sent. 7909 len. 22]: Nay , but ere I believe it , I will search through all creation , and cry aloud as I go .
Parsing [sent. 7910 len. 17]: I will search until I find him , and if I find him not , -- .
Parsing [sent. 7911 len. 25]: With that my soul would have fainted in me , had I not spread forth my wings and rushed aloft to find him . ''
Parsing [sent. 7912 len. 87]: ` For the more lovely anything I saw , the more gracious in colour or form , or the more marvellous in the law of its working , ever a fresh pang shot to my heart : if that which I had heard should prove true , then was there no Love such as seemed to me to dwell therein , the soul of its beauty , and all the excellence thereof was but a delusion of my own heart , greedy after a phantom perfection .
Parsing [sent. 7913 len. 3]: No God !
Parsing [sent. 7914 len. 3]: no Love !
Parsing [sent. 7915 len. 9]: no loveliness , save a ghastly semblance thereof !
Parsing [sent. 7916 len. 25]: and the more ghastly that it was so like loveliness , and yet was not to be loved upon peril of prostitution of spirit .
Parsing [sent. 7917 len. 14]: Then in truth was heaven a fable , and hell an all-embracing fact !
Parsing [sent. 7918 len. 73]: for my very being knew in itself that if it would dwell in peace , the very atmosphere in which it lived and moved and breathed must be love , living love , a one divine presence , truth to itself , and love to me , and to all them that needed love , down to the poorest that can but need it , and knoweth it not when it cometh .
Parsing [sent. 7919 len. 45]: I knew that if love was not all in all , in fact as well as in imagination , my life was but a dreary hollow made in the shape of a life , and therefore for ever hungry and never to be satisfied .
Parsing [sent. 7920 len. 25]: And again I spread wings -- no longer as it seemed of hope , but wings of despair , yet mighty , and flew .
Parsing [sent. 7921 len. 15]: And I learned thereafter that despair is but the hidden side of hope . '
Parsing [sent. 7922 len. 12]: `` Here follow pages of his wanderings in quest of God .
Parsing [sent. 7923 len. 50]: He tells how and where he inquired and sought , searching into the near and minute as earnestly as into the far and vast , watching at the very pores of being , and sitting in the gates of the mighty halls of assembly -- but all in vain .
Parsing [sent. 7924 len. 8]: No God was to be found . ''
Parsing [sent. 7925 len. 37]: ` And it seemed to me , ' he says at last , ` that , as I had been the wanderer of earth , so was I now doomed to be the wanderer of heaven .
Parsing [sent. 7926 len. 34]: On earth I wandered to find death , and men called me the everlasting Jew ; in heaven I wandered to find God , and what name would they give me now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7927 len. 47]: ` At last my heart sank within me wholly , and I folded my wings , and through years I also sank and sank , and alighted at length upon the place appointed for my habitation -- that namely wherein I found myself first after death .
Parsing [sent. 7928 len. 12]: And alighting there , I fell down weary and slept . ''
Parsing [sent. 7929 len. 48]: ` And when I awoke I turned upon my side in the despair of a life that was neither in my own power nor in that of one who was the Father of me , which life therefore was an evil thing and a tyrant unto me .
Parsing [sent. 7930 len. 3]: And lo !
Parsing [sent. 7931 len. 26]: there by my side I beheld a lily of the field such as grew on the wayside in the old times betwixt Jerusalem and Bethany .
Parsing [sent. 7932 len. 40]: Never since my death had I seen such , and my heart awoke within me , and I wept bitter tears that nothing should be true , nothing be that which it had seemed in the times of old .
Parsing [sent. 7933 len. 33]: And as I wept I heard a sound as of the falling of many tears , and I looked , and lo a shower as from a watering-pot falling upon the lily !
Parsing [sent. 7934 len. 39]: And I looked yet again , and I saw the watering-pot , and the hand that held it ; and he whose hand held the pot stood by me and looked at me as he watered the lily .
Parsing [sent. 7935 len. 26]: He was a man like the men of the world where such lilies grow , and was poorly dressed , and seemed like a gardener .
Parsing [sent. 7936 len. 18]: And I looked up in his face , and lo -- the eyes of the Lord Jesus !
Parsing [sent. 7937 len. 89]: and my heart swelled until it filled my whole body and my head , and I gave a great cry , and for joy that turned into agony I could not rise , neither could I speak , but I crept on my hands and my knees to his feet , and there I fell down upon my face , and with my hands I lifted one of his feet and did place it upon my head , and then I found voice to cry , O master !
Parsing [sent. 7938 len. 8]: and therewith the life departed from me .
Parsing [sent. 7939 len. 30]: And when I came to myself the master sat under the tree , and I lay by his side , and he had lifted my head upon his knees .
Parsing [sent. 7940 len. 19]: And behold , the world was jubilant around me , for Love was Love and Lord of all .
Parsing [sent. 7941 len. 35]: The sea roared , and the fulness thereof was love ; and the purple and the gold and the blue and the green came straight from the hidden red heart of the Lord Jesus .
Parsing [sent. 7942 len. 40]: And I closed my eyes for very bliss ; nor had I yet bethought me of the time when first those eyes looked upon me , for I seemed to have known them since first I began to be .
Parsing [sent. 7943 len. 22]: But now when for very bliss I closed my eyes , my sin came back to me , and I remembered .
Parsing [sent. 7944 len. 46]: And I rose up , and kneeled down before him , and said , O Lord , I am Ahasuerus the Jew , the man who would not let thee rest thy cross upon the stone before my workshop , but drave thee from it .
Parsing [sent. 7945 len. 45]: -- Say no more of that , answered my Lord , for truly I have myself rested in thy heart , cross and all , until the thing thou diddest in thy ignorance is better than forgotten , for it is remembered in love .
Parsing [sent. 7946 len. 23]: Only see thou also make right excuse for my brethren who , like thee then , know not now what they do .
Parsing [sent. 7947 len. 18]: Come and I will bring thee to the woman who died for thee in the burning fire .
Parsing [sent. 7948 len. 52]: And I said , O Lord , leave me not , for although I would now in my turn right gladly die for her , yet would I not look upon that woman again if the love of her would make me love thee one hair the less -- thou knowest .
Parsing [sent. 7949 len. 25]: And the Lord smiled upon me and said , Fear not , Ahasuerus ; my love infolds and is the nest of all love .
Parsing [sent. 7950 len. 9]: I fear not ; fear thou not either .
Parsing [sent. 7951 len. 7]: And I arose and followed him .
Parsing [sent. 7952 len. 42]: And every tree and flower , yea every stone and cloud , with the whole earth and sea and air , were full of God , even the living God -- so that now I could have died of pure content .
Parsing [sent. 7953 len. 8]: And I followed my Lord . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 7954 len. 11]: The gate-keeper was silent , and so were they all .
Parsing [sent. 7955 len. 18]: At length Rachel rose softly , wiping the tears from her eyes , and left the room .
Parsing [sent. 7956 len. 9]: But she found no one in the closet .
Parsing [sent. 7957 len. 13]: Helen was already hastening across the park , weeping as she went .
Parsing [sent. 7958 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXIX .
Parsing [sent. 7959 len. 5]: THE CURATE 'S RESOLVE .
Parsing [sent. 7960 len. 6]: The next day was Sunday .
Parsing [sent. 7961 len. 16]: Twelve months had not yet elapsed since the small events with which my narrative opened .
Parsing [sent. 7962 len. 98]: The change which had passed , not merely upon the opinions , but in the heart and mind and very being of the curate , had not then begun to appear even to himself , although its roots were not only deep in him but deep beyond him , even in the source of him ; and now he was in a state of mind , a state of being , rather , of whose nature at that time he had not , and could not have had , the faintest fore-feeling , the most shadowy conception .
Parsing [sent. 7963 len. 49]: It had been a season of great trouble , but the gain had been infinitely greater ; for now were the bonds of the finite broken , he had burst the shell of the mortal , and was of those over whom the second death hath no power .
Parsing [sent. 7964 len. 85]: The agony of the second birth was past , and he was a child again -- only a child , he knew , but a child of the kingdom ; and the world , and all that God cared about in it , was his , as no miser 's gold could ever belong to its hoarder , while the created universe , yea and the uncreated also whence it sprang , lay open to him in the boundless free-giving of the original Thought .
Parsing [sent. 7965 len. 54]: `` All things are yours , and ye are Christ 's , and Christ is God 's : '' he understood the words even as he who said them understood them , and as the wise of this world never will understand them until first they become fools that they may be wise .
Parsing [sent. 7966 len. 82]: At the same time a great sorrow threatened him from the no less mysterious region of his relations to humanity ; but if that region and its most inexplicable cares were beyond the rule of the Life that dwelt in him , then was that Life no true God , and the whole thing was false ; for he loved Helen with a love that was no invention or creation of his own , and if not his , then whose ?
Parsing [sent. 7967 len. 21]: Certainly not of one who , when it threatened to overwhelm him , was unable to uphold him under it !
Parsing [sent. 7968 len. 11]: This thing also belonged to the God of his being .
Parsing [sent. 7969 len. 25]: A poor God must he be for men or women who did not care about the awful things involved in the relation between them !
Parsing [sent. 7970 len. 242]: Therefore even in his worst anxieties about Helen , -- I do not mean in his worst seasons of despair at the thought of never gaining her love -- he had never yet indeed consciously regarded the winning of her as a possibility -- but at those times when he most plainly saw her the submissive disciple of George Bascombe , and the two seemed to his fancy to be straying away together `` into a wide field , full of dark mountains ; '' when he saw her , so capable of the noblest , submitting her mind to the entrance of the poorest , meanest , shabbiest theories of life , and taking for her guide one who could lead her to no conscious well-being , or make provision for sustainment when the time of suffering and anxiety should come , or the time of health and strength be over when yet she must live on ; when he saw her adopting a system of things whose influence would shrivel up instead of developing her faculties , crush her imagination with such a mountain-weight as was never piled above Titan , and dwarf the whole divine woman within her to the size and condition of an Aztec -- even then was he able to reason with himself : `` She belongs to God , not to me ; and God loves her better than ever I could love her .
Parsing [sent. 7971 len. 39]: If she should set out with her blind guide , it will be but a first day 's journey she will go -- through marshy places and dry sands , across the far breadth of which , lo !
Parsing [sent. 7972 len. 14]: the blue mountains that shelter the high vales of sweetness and peace . ''
Parsing [sent. 7973 len. 25]: And with this he not only tried to comfort himself , but succeeded -- I do not say to contentment , but to quiet .
Parsing [sent. 7974 len. 25]: Contentment , which , whatever its immediate shape , to be contentment at all , must be the will of God , lay beyond .
Parsing [sent. 7975 len. 24]: Alas that men can not believe there is such a thing as `` that good and acceptable and perfect will of God ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7976 len. 16]: To those that do believe it , it is the rejoicing of a conscious deliverance .
Parsing [sent. 7977 len. 17]: And now this Sunday , Wingfold entered the pulpit prepared at last to utter his resolve .
Parsing [sent. 7978 len. 14]: Happily nothing had been done to introduce the confusing element of another will .
Parsing [sent. 7979 len. 22]: The bishop had heard nothing of the matter , and if anything had reached the rector , he had not spoken .
Parsing [sent. 7980 len. 21]: Not one of the congregation , not even Mrs. Ramshorn , had hinted to him that he ought to resign .
Parsing [sent. 7981 len. 8]: It had been left altogether with himself .
Parsing [sent. 7982 len. 19]: And now he would tell them the decision to which the thought he had taken had conducted him .
Parsing [sent. 7983 len. 41]: I will give a portion of his sermon -- enough to show us how he showed the congregation the state of his mind in reference to the grand question , and the position he took in relation to his hearers .
Parsing [sent. 7984 len. 56]: `` It is time , my hearers , '' he said , `` because it is now possible , to bring to a close that uncertainty with regard to the continuance of our relation to each other , which I was , in the spring-time of the year , compelled by mental circumstance to occasion .
Parsing [sent. 7985 len. 38]: I then forced myself , for very dread of the honesty of an all-knowing God , to break through every convention of the church and the pulpit , and speak to you of my most private affairs .
Parsing [sent. 7986 len. 61]: I told you that I was sure of not one of those things concerning which it is taken for granted that a clergyman must be satisfied ; but that I would not at once yield my office , lest in that act I should seem to declare unbelief of many a thing which even then I desired to find true .
Parsing [sent. 7987 len. 31]: In leaving me undisturbed either by complaint , expostulation , or proffered instruction , you , my hearers , have granted me the leisure of which I stood in need .
Parsing [sent. 7988 len. 24]: Meantime I have endeavoured to show you the best I saw , while yet I dared not say I was sure of anything .
Parsing [sent. 7989 len. 22]: I have thus kept you , those at least who cared to follow my path , acquainted with my mental history .
Parsing [sent. 7990 len. 16]: And now I come to tell you the practical result at which I have arrived .
Parsing [sent. 7991 len. 58]: `` But when I say that I will not forsake my curacy , still less my right and duty to teach whatever I seem to know , I must not therein convey the impression that I have attained that conviction and assurance the discovery of the absence of which was the cause of the whole uncertain proceeding .
Parsing [sent. 7992 len. 277]: All I now say is , that in the story of Jesus I have beheld such grandeur -- to me apparently altogether beyond the reach of human invention , such a radiation of divine loveliness and truth , such hope for man , soaring miles above every possible pitfall of Fate ; and have at the same time , from the endeavour to obey the word recorded as his , experienced such a conscious enlargement of mental faculty , such a deepening of moral strength , such an enhancement of ideal , such an increase of faith , hope , and charity towards all men , that I now declare with the consent of my whole man -- I cast in my lot with the servants of the Crucified ; I am content even to share their delusion , if delusion it be , for it is the truth of the God of men to me ; I will stand or fall with the story of my Lord ; I will take my chance -- I speak not in irreverence but in honesty -- my chance of failure or success in regard to whatever may follow in this life or the life to come , if there be a life to come -- on the words and will of the Lord Jesus Christ , whom if , impressed as I am with the truth of his nature , the absolute devotion of his life , and the essential might of his being , I yet obey not , I shall not only deserve to perish , but in that very refusal draw ruin upon my head .
Parsing [sent. 7993 len. 62]: Before God I say it -- I would rather be crucified with that man , so it might be as a disciple and not as a thief that creeps , intrudes , or climbs into the fold , than I would reign with him over such a kingdom of grandeur as would have satisfied the imagination and love-ambition of his mother .
Parsing [sent. 7994 len. 68]: On such grounds as these I hope I am justified in declaring myself a disciple of the Son of Man , and in devoting my life and the renewed energy and enlarged , yea infinite hope which he has given me , to his brothers and sisters of my race , that if possible I may gain some to be partakers of the blessedness of my hope .
Parsing [sent. 7995 len. 47]: Henceforth I am , not IN HOLY ORDERS , I reject the phrase , but UNDER holy orders , even the orders of Christ Jesus , which is the law of liberty , the law whose obedience alone can set a man free from in-burrowing slavery .
Parsing [sent. 7996 len. 69]: `` And if any man yet say that , because of my lack of absolute assurance , I have no right to the sacred post , -- Let him , I answer , who has been assailed by such doubts as mine , and from the citadel of his faith sees no more one lingering shadow of a foe -- let him cast at me the first stone !
Parsing [sent. 7997 len. 3]: Vain challenge !
Parsing [sent. 7998 len. 14]: for such a one will never cast a stone at man or woman .
Parsing [sent. 7999 len. 72]: But let not him whose belief is but the absence of doubt , who has never loved enough that which he thinks he believes to have felt a single fear lest it should not be true -- let not that man , I say , cast at me pebble from the brook , or cloven rock from the mount of the law , for either will fall hurtless at my feet .
Parsing [sent. 8000 len. 15]: Friends , I have for the last time spoken of myself in this place .
Parsing [sent. 8001 len. 14]: Ye have borne with me in my trials , and I thank you .
Parsing [sent. 8002 len. 20]: Those who have not only borne but suffered , and do now rejoice with me , I thank tenfold .
Parsing [sent. 8003 len. 33]: I have done -- `` Save for one word to the Christians of this congregation : `` The waves of infidelity are coming in with a strong wind and a flowing tide .
Parsing [sent. 8004 len. 5]: Who is to blame ?
Parsing [sent. 8005 len. 16]: God it can not be , and for unbelievers , they are as they were .
Parsing [sent. 8006 len. 9]: It is the Christians who are to blame .
Parsing [sent. 8007 len. 19]: I do not mean those who are called Christians , but those who call and count themselves Christians .
Parsing [sent. 8008 len. 107]: I tell you , and I speak to each one of whom it is true , that you hold and present such a withered , starved , miserable , death 's - head idea of Christianity ; that you are yourselves such poverty-stricken believers , if believers you are at all ; that the notion you present to the world as your ideal , is so commonplace , so false to the grand , gracious , mighty-hearted Jesus -- that YOU are the cause why the truth hangs its head in patience , and rides not forth on the white horse , conquering and to conquer .
Parsing [sent. 8009 len. 80]: You dull its lustre in the eyes of men ; you deform its fair proportions ; you represent not that which it is , but that which it is not , yet call yourselves by its name ; you are not the salt of the earth , but a salt that has lost its savour , for ye seek all things else first , and to that seeking the kingdom of God and his righteousness shall never be added .
Parsing [sent. 8010 len. 79]: Until you repent and believe afresh , believe in a nobler Christ , namely the Christ revealed by himself , and not the muffled form of something vaguely human and certainly not all divine , which the false interpretations of men have substituted for him , you will be , as , I repeat , you are , the main reason why faith is so scanty in the earth , and the enemy comes in like a flood .
Parsing [sent. 8011 len. 49]: For the sake of the progress of the truth , and that into nobler minds than yours , it were better you joined the ranks of the enemy , and declared what I fear with many of you is the fact , that you believe not at all .
Parsing [sent. 8012 len. 72]: But whether in some sense you believe or not , the fact remains , that , while you are not of those Christians who obey the word of the master , DOING the things he says to them , you are of those Christians , if you WILL be called by the name , to whom he will say , I never knew you : go forth into the outer darkness .
Parsing [sent. 8013 len. 29]: Then at least will the church be rid of you , and the honest doubter will have room to breathe the divine air of the presence of Jesus .
Parsing [sent. 8014 len. 61]: `` But oh what unspeakable bliss of heart and soul and mind and sense remains for him who like St. Paul is crucified with Christ , who lives no more from his own self , but is inspired and informed and possessed with the same faith towards the Father in which Jesus lived and wrought the will of the Father !
Parsing [sent. 8015 len. 66]: If the words attributed to Jesus are indeed the words of him whom Jesus declared himself , then truly is the fate of mankind a glorious one , -- and that , first and last , because men have a God supremely grand , all-perfect in God-head ; for that is , and that alone can be , the absolute bliss of the created . ''
Parsing [sent. 8016 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXX .
Parsing [sent. 8017 len. 3]: HELEN AWAKE .
Parsing [sent. 8018 len. 8]: That Sunday-dinner was a very quiet meal .
Parsing [sent. 8019 len. 51]: An old friend of Mrs. Ramshorn , a lady-ecclesiastic like herself , dined with them ; what the two may have said to each other in secret conclave , I can not tell , but not a word of remark upon Mr. Wingfold or his sermon was heard at table .
Parsing [sent. 8020 len. 22]: As she was leaving the room , Bascombe whispered Helen to put on something and come to him in the garden .
Parsing [sent. 8021 len. 9]: Helen glanced at the window as if doubtful .
Parsing [sent. 8022 len. 28]: It was cold , but the sun was shining ; the weather had nothing to do with it ; she had but taken a moment to think .
Parsing [sent. 8023 len. 9]: She pressed her lips together -- and consented .
Parsing [sent. 8024 len. 39]: George saw she would rather not go , but he set it down to a sisterly unwillingness to enjoy herself when her brother could no longer behold the sun , and such mere sentiment must not be encouraged .
Parsing [sent. 8025 len. 24]: When the cypresses and box-trees had come betwixt them and the house , he offered his arm , but Helen preferred being free .
Parsing [sent. 8026 len. 26]: She did not refuse to go into the summer-house with him ; but she took her place on the opposite side of the little table .
Parsing [sent. 8027 len. 9]: George however spied no hint of approaching doom .
Parsing [sent. 8028 len. 22]: `` I am sorry to have to alter my opinion of that curate , '' he said as he seated himself .
Parsing [sent. 8029 len. 14]: `` There was so much in him that I took to promise well .
Parsing [sent. 8030 len. 30]: But old habit , the necessities of existence , and the fear of society have been too much for him -- as they will always be for most men .
Parsing [sent. 8031 len. 11]: He has succumbed at last , and I am sorry !
Parsing [sent. 8032 len. 14]: I did think he was going to turn out an honest man ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8033 len. 20]: `` And you have come to the certain conclusion that he is not an honest man , George ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8034 len. 4]: `` Assuredly . ''
Parsing [sent. 8035 len. 4]: `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8036 len. 17]: `` Because he goes on to teach what he confesses he is not sure about . ''
Parsing [sent. 8037 len. 17]: `` He professes to be sure that it is better than anything he is sure about .
Parsing [sent. 8038 len. 18]: -- You teach me there is no God : are you absolutely certain there is not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8039 len. 7]: `` Yes ; absolutely certain . ''
Parsing [sent. 8040 len. 6]: `` On what grounds ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8041 len. 23]: `` On grounds I have set forth to you twenty times , Helen , dear , '' answered George a little impatiently .
Parsing [sent. 8042 len. 11]: `` I am not inclined to talk about them now .
Parsing [sent. 8043 len. 15]: -- I can no more believe in a god than in a dragon . ''
Parsing [sent. 8044 len. 31]: `` And yet a dragon was believable to the poets that made our old ballads ; and now geology reveals that some-such creatures did at one time actually exist . ''
Parsing [sent. 8045 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 8046 len. 10]: you turn the tables on me there , Helen !
Parsing [sent. 8047 len. 9]: I confess my parallel a false one . ''
Parsing [sent. 8048 len. 14]: `` A truer one than you think , perhaps , '' said Helen .
Parsing [sent. 8049 len. 48]: `` That a thing should seem absurd to one man , or to a thousand men , will not make it absurd in its own nature ; and men as good and as clever as you , George , have in all ages believed in a God .
Parsing [sent. 8050 len. 12]: Only their notion of God may have been different from yours .
Parsing [sent. 8051 len. 14]: Perhaps their notion was a believable one , while yours is not . ''
Parsing [sent. 8052 len. 6]: `` By Jove , Helen !
Parsing [sent. 8053 len. 8]: you 've got on with your logic .
Parsing [sent. 8054 len. 5]: I feel quite flattered !
Parsing [sent. 8055 len. 17]: So far as I am aware you have had no tutor in that branch but myself !
Parsing [sent. 8056 len. 14]: You 'll soon be too much for your master , by Jove ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8057 len. 11]: Like the pied piper , Helen smiled a little smile .
Parsing [sent. 8058 len. 44]: But she said seriously , `` Well , George , all I have to suggest is -- What if , after all your inability to believe it , things should at last prove , even to your -- satisfaction , shall I say ?
Parsing [sent. 8059 len. 8]: -- that there IS a God ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8060 len. 62]: `` Do n't trouble yourself a bit about it , Helen , '' returned George , whose mind was full of something else , to introduce which he was anxiously , and heedlessly , clearing the way : `` I am prepared to take my chance , and all I care about is whether you will take your chance with me .
Parsing [sent. 8061 len. 11]: Helen , I love you with my whole soul . ''
Parsing [sent. 8062 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 8063 len. 9]: you have a soul , then , George ?
Parsing [sent. 8064 len. 7]: I thought you had n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8065 len. 25]: `` It IS a foolish form of speech , no doubt , '' returned Bascombe , a little disconcerted , as was natural . ''
Parsing [sent. 8066 len. 14]: -- But to be serious , Helen , I do love you . ''
Parsing [sent. 8067 len. 18]: `` How long will you love me if I tell you I do n't love you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8068 len. 16]: `` Really , Helen , I do n't see how to answer such a question .
Parsing [sent. 8069 len. 9]: I do n't understand you at all to-day !
Parsing [sent. 8070 len. 5]: Have I offended you ?
Parsing [sent. 8071 len. 24]: I am very sorry if I have , but I am quite in the dark as to when or where or how . ''
Parsing [sent. 8072 len. 32]: `` Tell me then , '' said Helen , heedless of his evident annoyance and discomfort , `` how long will you love me if I love you in return ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8073 len. 7]: `` For ever and ever . ''
Parsing [sent. 8074 len. 7]: `` Another form of speech ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8075 len. 9]: `` You know what I mean well enough .
Parsing [sent. 8076 len. 11]: I shall love you as long as I live . ''
Parsing [sent. 8077 len. 20]: `` George , I never could love a man who believed I was going to die for ever . ''
Parsing [sent. 8078 len. 21]: `` But , Helen , '' pleaded Bascombe , `` if it ca n't be helped , you know ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8079 len. 10]: `` But you are content it should be so .
Parsing [sent. 8080 len. 5]: You believe it willingly .
Parsing [sent. 8081 len. 11]: You scoff at any hint of a possible immortality . ''
Parsing [sent. 8082 len. 18]: `` Well , but , Helen , what difference can it make between you and me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8083 len. 22]: returned George , whom the danger of losing her had rendered for the moment indifferent even to his most cherished theory .
Parsing [sent. 8084 len. 25]: `` If there should be anything afterwards , of course I should go on loving you to the very extreme of the possible . ''
Parsing [sent. 8085 len. 18]: `` While now you do n't love me enough to wish I may live and not die !
Parsing [sent. 8086 len. 23]: Leaving that out of view however , it makes all the difference to the love I should have to expect of you .
Parsing [sent. 8087 len. 48]: It may be only a whim -- I can prove nothing any more than you -- but I have a -- whim then -- to be loved as an immortal woman , the child of a living God , and not as a helpless bastard of Nature !
Parsing [sent. 8088 len. 12]: -- I beg your pardon -- I forget my manners . ''
Parsing [sent. 8089 len. 9]: That a lady should utter such a word !
Parsing [sent. 8090 len. 7]: -- and that lady , Helen !
Parsing [sent. 8091 len. 5]: -- George was shocked .
Parsing [sent. 8092 len. 10]: Coming on the rest , it absolutely bewildered him .
Parsing [sent. 8093 len. 5]: He sat silent perforce .
Parsing [sent. 8094 len. 32]: Helen saw it , and yielded to a moment 's annoyance with herself , but presently resumed : `` I have given you the advantage , George , and wronged myself .
Parsing [sent. 8095 len. 7]: But I do n't care MUCH .
Parsing [sent. 8096 len. 12]: I shall only take the better courage to speak my mind .
Parsing [sent. 8097 len. 28]: -- You come asking me to love you , and my brother lying mouldering in the earth -- all there is of him , you tell me !
Parsing [sent. 8098 len. 47]: If you believed he was alive still , and I should find him again some day , there would be no reason why you should not speak of love even now ; for where does anyone need love more than at the brink of the grave ?
Parsing [sent. 8099 len. 57]: But to come talking of love to me , with the same voice that has but just been teaching me that the grave is the end of all , and my brother gone down into it for ever -- I tell you , cousin -- I must say it -- it seems to me hardly decent .
Parsing [sent. 8100 len. 21]: For me at least -- I will NOT be loved with the love that can calmly accept such a fate .
Parsing [sent. 8101 len. 33]: And I will never love any man , believing that , if I outlive him , my love must thereafter be but a homeless torrent , falling ever into a bottomless abyss .
Parsing [sent. 8102 len. 15]: Why should I make of my heart a roaring furnace of regrets and self-accusations ?
Parsing [sent. 8103 len. 10]: The memory of my brother is for me enough .
Parsing [sent. 8104 len. 31]: Let me keep what freedom is possible to me ; let me rather live the life of a cold-blooded animal , and die in the ice that gathers about me .
Parsing [sent. 8105 len. 58]: But before I sit down to await such an end , I shall know whether I am indeed compelled to believe as you do that there is no God , that Death is my lord and master , that he will take me as he has taken my brother and yet I shall never see him more .
Parsing [sent. 8106 len. 23]: No , cousin George , I need a God ; and if there be none how did I come to need one ?
Parsing [sent. 8107 len. 32]: Yes , I know you think you can explain it all , but the way you account for it is just as miserable as what you would put in its place .
Parsing [sent. 8108 len. 9]: I am not complete in myself like you .
Parsing [sent. 8109 len. 10]: I am not able to live without a God .
Parsing [sent. 8110 len. 21]: I will seek him until I find him , or drop into the abyss where all question and answer ceases .
Parsing [sent. 8111 len. 44]: Then in the end I shall be no worse than you would have me at the beginning -- no , it will be nothing so bad , for then I shall not know my misery as you would have me know it now .
Parsing [sent. 8112 len. 63]: If we are creatures of nothing , in spite of all the outcry of our souls against that fate , what mighty matter is it if , thus utterly befooled of Nature , we should also a little fool ourselves , by believing in a lovely hope that looks like a promise , and seems as if it ought to be true ?
Parsing [sent. 8113 len. 24]: How can a devotion to the facts of her existence be required of one whose nature has been proved to her a lie ?
Parsing [sent. 8114 len. 21]: -- You speak from the facts of your nature , George ; I speak from the facts of mine . ''
Parsing [sent. 8115 len. 7]: Helen had come awake at last !
Parsing [sent. 8116 len. 23]: It would have suited George better had she remained a half-quickened statue , responsive only to himself , her not over-potent Pygmalion .
Parsing [sent. 8117 len. 11]: He sat speechless -- with his eyes fixed on her .
Parsing [sent. 8118 len. 17]: `` You need no God , '' she went on , `` therefore you seek none .
Parsing [sent. 8119 len. 16]: If you need none , you are right to seek none , I dare say .
Parsing [sent. 8120 len. 24]: But I need a God -- oh , I can not tell how I need him , if he be to be found !
Parsing [sent. 8121 len. 16]: and by the same reasoning I will give my life to the search for him .
Parsing [sent. 8122 len. 39]: To the last I will go on seeking him , for if once I give in , and confess there is no God , I shall go mad -- mad , and perhaps kill somebody like poor Poldie .
Parsing [sent. 8123 len. 8]: George , I have said my say .
Parsing [sent. 8124 len. 13]: I would not have come into the garden but to say it .
Parsing [sent. 8125 len. 3]: Good-bye . ''
Parsing [sent. 8126 len. 13]: As she spoke she rose and held out her hand to him .
Parsing [sent. 8127 len. 54]: But in the tumult of more emotions than I can well name -- amongst the rest indignation , dismay , disappointment , pride , and chagrin , he lost himself while searching in vain for words , paid no heed to her movement , and lifted no hand to take that she offered .
Parsing [sent. 8128 len. 9]: With head erect she walked from the summer-house .
Parsing [sent. 8129 len. 7]: `` The love of a lifetime !
Parsing [sent. 8130 len. 6]: -- a sweet invitation ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8131 len. 19]: she said to herself , as with the slow step of restrained wrath she went up the garden .
Parsing [sent. 8132 len. 11]: George sat for some minutes as she had left him .
Parsing [sent. 8133 len. 20]: Then he broke the silence in his own ears and said , `` Well , I 'm damned ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8134 len. 21]: And so he was -- for the time -- and a very good thing too , for he required it .
Parsing [sent. 8135 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXXI .
Parsing [sent. 8136 len. 5]: THOU DIDST NOT LEAVE .
Parsing [sent. 8137 len. 30]: The next day the curate found himself so ill at ease , from the reaction after excitement of various kinds , that he determined to give himself a holiday .
Parsing [sent. 8138 len. 39]: His notion of a holiday was a very simple one : a day in a deep wood , if such could be had , with a volume fit for alternate reading and pocketing as he might feel inclined .
Parsing [sent. 8139 len. 16]: Of late no volume had been his companion in any wanderings but his New Testament .
Parsing [sent. 8140 len. 37]: There was a remnant of real old-fashioned forest on the Lythe , some distance up : thither he went by the road , the shortest way , to return by the winding course of the stream .
Parsing [sent. 8141 len. 11]: It was a beautiful day of St. Martin 's summer .
Parsing [sent. 8142 len. 26]: In the forest , if the leaves were gone , there was the more light , and sun and shadow played many a lovely game .
Parsing [sent. 8143 len. 32]: But he saw them as though he saw them not , for fear and hope struggled in his heart , and for a long time prayer itself could not atone them .
Parsing [sent. 8144 len. 21]: At length a calm fell , and he set out to return home , down the bank of the river .
Parsing [sent. 8145 len. 69]: Many-hued and many-shaped had been the thoughts , not that came to him from the forest , but that he had carried thither with him : through all and each of them , ever and again had come dawning the face of Helen , as he had seen it in church the day before , where she sat between her aunt and her cousin , so unlike either .
Parsing [sent. 8146 len. 27]: For , to their annoyance , she had insisted on going to church , and to hers , they had refused to let her go alone .
Parsing [sent. 8147 len. 41]: And in her face the curate had seen something he had never seen there until then , -- a wistful look , as if now she would be glad to pick up any suitable crumb to carry home with her .
Parsing [sent. 8148 len. 41]: In that dawn of coming childhood , though he dared not yet altogether believe it such , the hard contemptuous expression of Bascombe 's countenance , and the severe disapproval in Mrs. Ramshorn 's , were entirely lost upon him .
Parsing [sent. 8149 len. 13]: All the way down the river , the sweet change haunted him .
Parsing [sent. 8150 len. 44]: When he got into the park , and reached that hollow betwixt the steep ferny slopes where he sat on the day with which my narrative opens , he seated himself again on the same stone , and reviewed the past twelve months .
Parsing [sent. 8151 len. 37]: This was much such a day as that , only the hour was different : it was the setting sun that now shone upon the ferns , and cast shadows from them big enough for oaks .
Parsing [sent. 8152 len. 8]: What a change had passed upon him !
Parsing [sent. 8153 len. 28]: That day the New Testament had been the book of the church -- this day it was a fountain of living waters to the man Thomas Wingfold .
Parsing [sent. 8154 len. 10]: He had not opened his Horace for six months .
Parsing [sent. 8155 len. 14]: Great trouble he had had ; both that and its results were precious .
Parsing [sent. 8156 len. 100]: Now a new trouble had come , but that also was a form of life : he would rather love and suffer and love still , a thousand times rather , than return to the poverty of not knowing Helen Lingard ; yet a thousand times rather would he forget Helen Lingard than lose from his heart one word of the Master , whose love was the root and only pledge and security of love , the only power that could glorify it -- could cleanse it from the mingled selfishness that wrought for its final decay and death .
Parsing [sent. 8157 len. 30]: The sun was down ere he left the park , and the twilight was rapidly following the sun as he drew near to the Abbey on his way home .
Parsing [sent. 8158 len. 18]: Suddenly , more like an odour than a sound , he heard the organ , he thought .
Parsing [sent. 8159 len. 21]: Never yet had he heard it on a week-day : the organist was not of those who haunt their instrument .
Parsing [sent. 8160 len. 116]: Often of late had the curate gazed on that organ as upon a rock filled with sweet waters , before which he stood a Moses without his rod ; sometimes the solemn instrument appeared to him a dumb Jeremiah that sat there from Sunday to Sunday , all the week long , with his head bowed upon his hands , and not a Jebusite to listen to him : if only his fingers had been taught the craft , he thought , how his soul would pour itself out through the song-tubes of that tabernacle of sweetness and prayer , and on the blast of its utterance ascend to the throne of the most high !
Parsing [sent. 8161 len. 24]: Who could it be that was now peopling the silence of the vast church with melodious sounds , worshipping creatures of the elements ?
Parsing [sent. 8162 len. 24]: If the winds and the flames of fire are his augels , how much more the grandly consorting tones of the heavenly organ !
Parsing [sent. 8163 len. 12]: He would go and see what power informed the vaporous music .
Parsing [sent. 8164 len. 32]: He entered the church by one of the towers , in which a stair led skyward , passing the neighbourhood of the organ , and having a door to its loft .
Parsing [sent. 8165 len. 48]: As he ascended , came a pause in the music ; -- and then , like the breaking up of a summer cloud in the heavenliest of rain-showers , began the prelude to the solo in the Messiah , THOU DIDST NOT LEAVE HIS SOUL IN HELL .
Parsing [sent. 8166 len. 7]: Up still the curate crept softly .
Parsing [sent. 8167 len. 35]: All at once a rich full contralto voice -- surely he had heard it before -- came floating out on the torrent , every tone bearing a word of sorrowful triumph in its bosom .
Parsing [sent. 8168 len. 5]: He reached the door .
Parsing [sent. 8169 len. 10]: Very gently he opened it , and peeped in .
Parsing [sent. 8170 len. 16]: But the back of the organ was towards him , and he could see nothing .
Parsing [sent. 8171 len. 10]: He stepped upon the tiles of the little apse .
Parsing [sent. 8172 len. 23]: One stride cleared the end of the organ , and he saw the face of the singer : it WAS Helen Lingard !
Parsing [sent. 8173 len. 3]: She started .
Parsing [sent. 8174 len. 15]: The music folded its wings and dropped -- like a lark into its nest .
Parsing [sent. 8175 len. 20]: But Helen recovered herself at once , rose from her ministration at the music-altar , and approached the curate .
Parsing [sent. 8176 len. 10]: `` Have I taken too great a liberty ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8177 len. 10]: she said , in a gentle , steady voice .
Parsing [sent. 8178 len. 9]: `` No , surely , '' he answered .
Parsing [sent. 8179 len. 8]: `` I am sorry I startled you .
Parsing [sent. 8180 len. 10]: I wish you would wake such sounds oftener . ''
Parsing [sent. 8181 len. 19]: `` He did n't leave my brother 's soul in hell , did he , Mr. Wingfold ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8182 len. 12]: she said abruptly , and her eyes shone through the dusk .
Parsing [sent. 8183 len. 21]: `` If ever a soul was taken out of hell , it was Leopold 's , '' returned the curate .
Parsing [sent. 8184 len. 22]: `` And it lifts mine out of it too , '' he added , `` to hear you say so . ''
Parsing [sent. 8185 len. 8]: `` I behaved very badly to you .
Parsing [sent. 8186 len. 5]: I confess my fault .
Parsing [sent. 8187 len. 6]: Will you forgive me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8188 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 8189 len. 34]: `` I love you too much to be able to forgive you : '' that was the word in the curate 's heart , but a different found its way to his lips .
Parsing [sent. 8190 len. 24]: `` My heart is open to you , Miss Lingard , '' he said : `` take what forgiveness you think you need .
Parsing [sent. 8191 len. 20]: For what I can tell , it may be my part to ask forgiveness , not to grant it .
Parsing [sent. 8192 len. 19]: If I have been harder to you than there was need , I pray you to forgive me .
Parsing [sent. 8193 len. 11]: Perhaps I did not enter enough into your difficulties . ''
Parsing [sent. 8194 len. 17]: `` You never said one word more than was right , or harder than I deserved .
Parsing [sent. 8195 len. 2]: Alas !
Parsing [sent. 8196 len. 46]: I can no more -- in this world at least -- ask Leopold to forgive me , but I can ask you and Mr. Polwarth , who were as the angels of God to him , to pardon me for him and for yourselves too .
Parsing [sent. 8197 len. 8]: I was obstinate and proud and selfish .
Parsing [sent. 8198 len. 18]: -- Oh , Mr. Wingfold , can you , do you really believe that Leopold is somewhere ?
Parsing [sent. 8199 len. 6]: Is he alive this moment ?
Parsing [sent. 8200 len. 27]: Shall I ever -- ever -- I do n't mind if it 's a thousand years first -- but shall I EVER see him again ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8201 len. 6]: `` I do think so .
Parsing [sent. 8202 len. 34]: I think the story must be true that tells us Jesus took to himself again the body he left on the cross , and brought it with him out of its grave . ''
Parsing [sent. 8203 len. 33]: `` Will you take me for a pupil -- a disciple -- and teach me to believe -- or hope , if you like that word better -- as you do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8204 len. 4]: said Helen humbly .
Parsing [sent. 8205 len. 16]: How the heart of the curate beat -- like the drum of a praising orchestra !
Parsing [sent. 8206 len. 53]: `` Dear Miss Lingard , '' he answered , very solemnly , `` I can teach you nothing ; I can but show you where I found what has changed my life from a bleak November to a sunny June -- with its thunder-storms no doubt -- but still June beside November .
Parsing [sent. 8207 len. 24]: Perhaps I could help you a little if you were really set out to find Jesus , but you must yourself set out .
Parsing [sent. 8208 len. 8]: It is you who must find him .
Parsing [sent. 8209 len. 42]: Words of mine , as the voice of one crying in the wilderness , may let you know that one is near who thinks he sees him , but it is you who must search , and you who must find .
Parsing [sent. 8210 len. 16]: If you do search , you will find , with or without help of mine .
