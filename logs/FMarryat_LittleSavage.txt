Parsing [sent. 1 len. 20]: THE LITTLE SAVAGE BY CAPTAIN MARRYAT THIS IS FAIRY GOLD , BOY ; AND ' T WILL PROVE SO .
Parsing [sent. 2 len. 46]: SHAKESPEARE INTRODUCTION There is a reference , in _ The Life and Letters of Captain Marryat _ by his daughter Florence Marryat , to '' _ The Little Savage _ , only two chapters of the second volume of which were written by himself . ''
Parsing [sent. 3 len. 42]: This sentence may be variously interpreted , but most probably implies that Marryat wrote all Part I -LRB- of the first edition -RRB- and two chapters of Part II , that is -- as far as the end of Chapter xxiv .
Parsing [sent. 4 len. 78]: The remaining pages may be the work of his son Frank S. Marryat , who _ edited _ the first edition , supplying a brief preface to Part II : -- `` I can not publish this last work of my late father without some prefatory remarks , as , in justice to the public , as well as to himself , I should state , that his lamented decease prevented his concluding the second volume . ''
Parsing [sent. 5 len. 24]: `` The present volume has been for some time at press , but the long-protracted illness of the author delayed its publication . ''
Parsing [sent. 6 len. 8]: _ The Little Savage _ opens well .
Parsing [sent. 7 len. 51]: The picture of a lad , who was born on a desert island -- though of English parents -- and really deserves to be called a savage , growing up with no other companionship than that of his father 's murderer , is boldly conceived and executed with some power .
Parsing [sent. 8 len. 25]: The man Jackson is a thoroughly human ruffian , who naturally detests the boy he has so terribly injured , and bullies him brutally .
Parsing [sent. 9 len. 36]: Under this treatment Frank 's animal passions are inevitably aroused , and when the lightning had struck his tyrant blind , he turns upon him with a quiet savagery that is narrated with admirable detachment .
Parsing [sent. 10 len. 22]: This original situation arrests the reader 's attention and secures his interest in Frank Henniker 's development towards civilisation and virtue .
Parsing [sent. 11 len. 39]: His experience of absolute solitude after Jackson 's death serves to bring out his sympathies with animals and flowers ; while , on the arrival of Mrs Reichardt , he proves himself a loyal comrade under kind treatment .
Parsing [sent. 12 len. 16]: It is much to be regretted that Marryat did not live to finish his work .
Parsing [sent. 13 len. 13]: R. B. J. _ The Little Savage _ originally appeared in 1848-49 .
Parsing [sent. 14 len. 19]: Marryat , who was born in 1792 , died at Langham , Norfolk , August 9 , 1848 .
Parsing [sent. 15 len. 300]: The following is the list of his published works : -- Suggestions for the Abolition of the Present System of Impressment in the Naval Service , 1822 ; The Naval Officer , or Scenes and Adventures in the Life of Frank Mildmay , 1829 ; The King 's Own , 1830 ; Newton Forster -LRB- from the _ Metropolitan Magazine _ -RRB- , 1832 ; Jacob Faithful -LRB- from the _ Metropolitan Magazine _ -RRB- , 1834 ; Peter Simple , 1834 ; The Pacha of Many Tales , 1835 ; Midshipman Easy -LRB- from the _ Metropolitan Magazine _ -RRB- , 1836 ; Japhet in Search of a Father -LRB- from the _ Metropolitan Magazine _ -RRB- , 1836 ; The Pirate and The Three Cutters , 1836 ; A Code of Signals for the Use of Vessels employed in the Merchant Service , 1837 ; Snarleyyow , or The Dog Fiend , 1837 ; A Diary in America , with Remarks on its Institutions , 1839 ; The Phantom Ship , 1839 ; Poor Jack , 1840 ; Olla Podrida -LRB- articles from the _ Metropolitan Magazine _ -RRB- , 1840 ; Joseph Rushbrook , or The Poacher , 1841 ; Masterman Ready , or The Wreck of the _ Pacific _ , 1841 ; Percival Keene , 1842 ; Narrative of the Travels and Adventures of Monsieur Violet in California , Sonora , and Western Texas , 1843 ; The Settlers in Canada , 1844 ; The Mission , or Scenes in Africa , 1845 ; The Privateer 's Man , 1846 ; The Children of the New Forest , 1847 ; The Little Savage -LRB- posthumous -RRB- , 1848-49 ; Valerie -LRB- posthumous -RRB- , 1849 ; Life and Letters , Florence Marryat , 1872 .
Parsing [sent. 16 len. 29]: THE LITTLE SAVAGE Chapter I I am about to write a very curious history , as the reader will agree with me when he has read this book .
Parsing [sent. 17 len. 52]: We have more than one narrative of people being cast away upon desolate islands , and being left to their own resources , and no works are perhaps read with more interest ; but I believe I am the first instance of a boy being left alone upon an uninhabited island .
Parsing [sent. 18 len. 17]: Such was , however , the case ; and now I shall tell my own story .
Parsing [sent. 19 len. 26]: My first recollections are , that I was in company with a man upon this island , and that we walked often along the sea-shore .
Parsing [sent. 20 len. 25]: It was rocky and difficult to climb in many parts , and the man used to drag or pull me over the dangerous places .
Parsing [sent. 21 len. 32]: He was very unkind to me , which may appear strange , as I was the only companion that he had ; but he was of a morose and gloomy disposition .
Parsing [sent. 22 len. 73]: He would sit down squatted in the corner of our cabin , and sometimes not speak for hours -- or he would remain the whole day looking out at the sea , as if watching for something , but what I never could tell ; for if I spoke , he would not reply ; and if near to him , I was sure to receive a cuff or a heavy blow .
Parsing [sent. 23 len. 21]: I should imagine that I was about five years old at the time that I first recollect clearly what passed .
Parsing [sent. 24 len. 6]: I may have been younger .
Parsing [sent. 25 len. 25]: I may as well here state what I gathered from him at different times , relative to our being left upon this desolate spot .
Parsing [sent. 26 len. 41]: It was with difficulty that I did so ; for , generally speaking , he would throw a stone at me if I asked questions , that is , if I repeatedly asked them after he had refused to answer .
Parsing [sent. 27 len. 33]: It was on one occasion , when he was lying sick , that I gained the information , and that only by refusing to attend him or bring him food and water .
Parsing [sent. 28 len. 69]: He would be very angry , and say , that when he got well again , he would make me smart for it ; but I cared not , for I was then getting strong , whilst he was getting weaker every day , and I had no love for him , for he had never shown any to me , but always treated me with great severity .
Parsing [sent. 29 len. 76]: He told me , that about twelve years before -LRB- not that I knew what he meant by a year , for I had never heard the term used by him -RRB- , an English ship -LRB- I did not know what a ship was -RRB- had been swamped near the island , in a heavy gale , and that seven men and one woman had been saved , and all the other people lost .
Parsing [sent. 30 len. 45]: That the ship had been broken into pieces , and that they had saved nothing -- that they had picked up among the rocks pieces of the wood with which it had been made , and had built the cabin in which we lived .
Parsing [sent. 31 len. 43]: That one had died after another , and had been buried -LRB- what death or burial meant , I had no idea at the time -RRB- , and that I had been born on the island ; -LRB- How was I born ?
Parsing [sent. 32 len. 33]: thought I -RRB- -- that most of them had died before I was two years old ; and that then , he and my mother were the only two left besides me .
Parsing [sent. 33 len. 9]: My mother had died a few months afterwards .
Parsing [sent. 34 len. 35]: I was obliged to ask him many questions to understand all this ; indeed , I did not understand it till long afterwards , although I had an idea of what he would say .
Parsing [sent. 35 len. 32]: Had I been left with any other person , I should , of course , by conversation , have learnt much ; but he never would converse , still less explain .
Parsing [sent. 36 len. 13]: He called me , Boy , and I called him , Master .
Parsing [sent. 37 len. 39]: His inveterate silence was the occasion of my language being composed of very few words ; for , except to order me to do this or that , to procure what was required , he never would converse .
Parsing [sent. 38 len. 38]: He did however mutter to himself , and talk in his sleep , and I used to lie awake and listen , that I might gain information ; not at first , but when I grew older .
Parsing [sent. 39 len. 10]: He used to cry out in his sleep constantly .
Parsing [sent. 40 len. 22]: -- `` A judgment , a judgment on me for my sins , my heavy sins -- God be merciful ! ''
Parsing [sent. 41 len. 29]: But what judgment , or what sin was , or what was God , I did not then know , although I mused on words repeated so often .
Parsing [sent. 42 len. 15]: I will now describe the island , and the way in which we lived .
Parsing [sent. 43 len. 35]: The island was very small , perhaps not three miles round ; it was of rock , and there was no beach nor landing place , the sea washing its sides with deep water .
Parsing [sent. 44 len. 84]: It was , as I afterwards discovered , one of the group of islands to which the Peruvians despatch vessels every year to collect the guano , or refuse of the sea birds which resort to the islands ; but the one on which we were was small , and detached some distance from the others , on which the guano was found in great profusion ; so that hitherto it had been neglected , and no vessel had ever come near it .
Parsing [sent. 45 len. 31]: Indeed , the other islands were not to be seen from it except on a very clear day , when they appeared like a cloud or mist on the horizon .
Parsing [sent. 46 len. 42]: The shores of the island were , moreover , so precipitous , that there was no landing place , and the eternal wash of the ocean would have made it almost impossible for a vessel to have taken off a cargo .
Parsing [sent. 47 len. 15]: Such was the island upon which I found myself in company with this man .
Parsing [sent. 48 len. 73]: Our cabin was built of ship-plank and timber , under the shelter of a cliff , about fifty yards from the water ; there was a flat of about thirty yards square in front of it , and from the cliff there trickled down a rill of water , which fell into a hole dug out to collect it , and then found its way over the flat to the rocks beneath .
Parsing [sent. 49 len. 40]: The cabin itself was large , and capable of holding many more people than had ever lived in it ; but it was not too large , as we had to secure in it our provisions for many months .
Parsing [sent. 50 len. 27]: There were several bed-places level with the floor , which were rendered soft enough to lie on , by being filled with the feathers of birds .
Parsing [sent. 51 len. 37]: Furniture there was none , except two or three old axes , blunted with long use , a tin pannikin , a mess kid and some rude vessels to hold water , cut out of wood .
Parsing [sent. 52 len. 31]: On the summit of the island there was a forest of underwood , and the bushes extended some distance down the ravines which led from the summit to the shore .
Parsing [sent. 53 len. 24]: One of my most arduous tasks was to climb these ravines and collect wood , but fortunately a fire was not often required .
Parsing [sent. 54 len. 40]: The climate was warm all the year round , and there seldom was a fall of rain ; when it did fall , it was generally expended on the summit of the island , and did not reach us .
Parsing [sent. 55 len. 63]: At a certain period of the year , the birds came to the island in numberless quantities to breed , and their chief resort was some tolerably level ground -- indeed , in many places , it was quite level with the accumulation of guano -- which ground was divided from the spot where our cabin was built by a deep ravine .
Parsing [sent. 56 len. 46]: On this spot , which might perhaps contain about twenty acres or more , the sea birds would sit upon their eggs , not four inches apart from each other , and the whole surface of this twenty acres would be completely covered with them .
Parsing [sent. 57 len. 30]: There they would remain from the time of the laying of the eggs , until the young ones were able to leave the nests and fly away with them .
Parsing [sent. 58 len. 30]: At the season when the birds were on the island , all was gaiety , bustle , and noise , but after their departure it was quiet and solitude .
Parsing [sent. 59 len. 52]: I used to long for their arrival , and was delighted with the animation which gladdened the island , the male birds diving in every direction after fish , wheeling and soaring in the air , and uttering loud cries , which were responded to by their mates on the nests .
Parsing [sent. 60 len. 45]: But it was also our harvest time ; we seldom touched the old birds , as they were not in flesh , but as soon as the young ones were within a few days of leaving the nests , we were then busy enough .
Parsing [sent. 61 len. 86]: In spite of the screaming and the flapping of their wings in our faces , and the darting their beaks at our eyes , of the old birds , as we robbed them of their progeny , we collected hundreds every day , and bore as heavy a load as we could carry across the ravine to the platform in front of our cabin , where we busied ourselves in skinning them , splitting them , and hanging them out to dry in the sun .
Parsing [sent. 62 len. 44]: The air of the island was so pure that no putrefaction ever took place , and during the last fortnight of the birds coming on the island , we had collected a sufficiency for our support until their return on the following year .
Parsing [sent. 63 len. 20]: As soon as they were quite dry they were packed up in a corner of the cabin for use .
Parsing [sent. 64 len. 36]: These birds were , it may be said , the only produce of the island , with the exception of fish , and the eggs taken at the time of their first making their nests .
Parsing [sent. 65 len. 9]: Fish were to be taken in large quantities .
Parsing [sent. 66 len. 31]: It was sufficient to put a line over the rocks , and it had hardly time to go down a fathom before anything at the end of it was seized .
Parsing [sent. 67 len. 16]: Indeed , our means of taking them were as simple as their voracity was great .
Parsing [sent. 68 len. 47]: Our lines were composed of the sinews of the legs of the man-of-war birds , as I afterwards heard them named ; and , as these were only about a foot long , it required a great many of them knotted together to make a line .
Parsing [sent. 69 len. 77]: At the end of the line was a bait fixed over a strong fish-bone , which was fastened to the line by the middle ; a half-hitch of the line round one end kept the bone on a parallel with the line until the bait was seized , when the line being taughtened , the half-hitch slipped off and the bone remained crossways in the gullet of the fish , which was drawn up by it .
Parsing [sent. 70 len. 26]: Simple as this contrivance was , it answered as well as the best hook , of which I had never seen one at that time .
Parsing [sent. 71 len. 48]: The fish were so strong and large , that , when I was young , the man would not allow me to attempt to catch them , lest they should pull me into the water ; but , as I grew bigger , I could master them .
Parsing [sent. 72 len. 42]: Such was our food from one year 's end to the other ; we had no variety , except when occasionally we broiled the dried birds or the fish upon the embers , instead of eating them dried by the sun .
Parsing [sent. 73 len. 18]: Our raiment , such as it was , we were also indebted to the feathered tribe for .
Parsing [sent. 74 len. 26]: The birds were skinned with the feathers on , and their skins sewn together with sinews , and a fish-bone by way of a needle .
Parsing [sent. 75 len. 28]: These garments were not very durable , but the climate was so fine that we did not suffer from the cold at any season of the year .
Parsing [sent. 76 len. 57]: I used to make myself a new dress every year when the birds came ; but by the time that they returned , I had little left of my last year 's suit , the fragments of which might be found among the rocky and steep parts of the ravine where we used to collect firing .
Parsing [sent. 77 len. 39]: Living such a life , with so few wants , and those periodically and easily supplied , hardly varied from one year 's end to another , it may easily be imagined that I had but few ideas .
Parsing [sent. 78 len. 66]: I might have had more , if my companion had not been of such a taciturn and morose habit ; as it was , I looked at the wide ocean , and the sky , and the sun , moon , and stars , wondering , puzzled , afraid to ask questions , and ending all by sleeping away a large portion of my existence .
Parsing [sent. 79 len. 19]: We had no tools except the old ones , which were useless -- no employment of any kind .
Parsing [sent. 80 len. 23]: There was a book , and I asked what it was for and what it was , but I got no answer .
Parsing [sent. 81 len. 39]: It remained upon the shelf , for if I looked at it I was ordered away , and at last I regarded it with a sort of fear , as if it were a kind of incomprehensible animal .
Parsing [sent. 82 len. 22]: The day was passed in idleness and almost silence ; perhaps not a dozen sentences were exchanged in the twenty-four hours .
Parsing [sent. 83 len. 26]: My companion always the same , brooding over something which appeared ever to occupy his thoughts , and angry if roused up from his reverie .
Parsing [sent. 84 len. 32]: Chapter II The reader must understand that the foregoing remarks are to be considered as referring to my position and amount of knowledge when I was seven or eight years old .
Parsing [sent. 85 len. 29]: My master , as I called him , was a short square-built man , about sixty years of age , as I afterwards estimated from recollection and comparison .
Parsing [sent. 86 len. 43]: His hair fell down his back in thick clusters and was still of a dark color , and his beard was full two feet long and very bushy ; indeed , he was covered with hair , wherever his person was exposed .
Parsing [sent. 87 len. 58]: He was , I should say , very powerful had he had occasion to exert his strength , but with the exception of the time at which we collected the birds , and occasionally going up the ravine to bring down faggots of wood , he seldom moved out of the cabin unless it was to bathe .
Parsing [sent. 88 len. 49]: There was a pool of salt water of about twenty yards square , near the sea , but separated from it by a low ridge of rocks , over which the waves only beat when the sea was rough and the wind on that side of the island .
Parsing [sent. 89 len. 25]: Every morning almost we went down to bathe in that pool , as it was secure from the sharks , which were very numerous .
Parsing [sent. 90 len. 28]: I could swim like a fish as early as I can recollect , but whether I was taught , or learnt myself , I can not tell .
Parsing [sent. 91 len. 30]: Thus was my life passed away ; my duties were trifling ; I had little or nothing to employ myself about , for I had no means of employment .
Parsing [sent. 92 len. 15]: I seldom heard the human voice , and became as taciturn as my companion .
Parsing [sent. 93 len. 55]: My amusements were equally confined -- looking down into the depths of the ocean , as I lay over the rocky wall which girded the major portion of the island , and watching the motions of the finny tribes below , wondering at the stars during the night season , eating , and sleeping .
Parsing [sent. 94 len. 13]: Thus did I pass away an existence without pleasure and without pain .
Parsing [sent. 95 len. 28]: As for what my thoughts were I can hardly say , my knowledge and my ideas were too confined for me to have any food for thought .
Parsing [sent. 96 len. 22]: I was little better than a beast of the field , that lies down on the pasture after he is filled .
Parsing [sent. 97 len. 41]: There was one great source of interest however , which was , to listen to the sleeping talk of my companion , and I always looked forward to the time when the night fell and we repaired to our beds .
Parsing [sent. 98 len. 59]: I would lie awake for hours , listening to his ejaculations and murmured speech , trying in vain to find out some meaning in what he would say -- but I gained little ; he talked of `` that woman '' -- appearing to be constantly with other men , and muttering about something he had hidden away .
Parsing [sent. 99 len. 59]: One night , when the moon was shining bright , he sat up in his bed , which , as I have before said , was on the floor of the cabin , and throwing aside the feathers upon which he had been lying , scratched the mould away below them and lifted up a piece of board .
Parsing [sent. 100 len. 12]: After a minute he replaced everything , and lay down again .
Parsing [sent. 101 len. 9]: He evidently was sleeping during the whole time .
Parsing [sent. 102 len. 13]: Here , at last , was something to feed my thoughts with .
Parsing [sent. 103 len. 21]: I had heard him say in his sleep that he had hidden something -- this must be the hiding place .
Parsing [sent. 104 len. 4]: What was it ?
Parsing [sent. 105 len. 39]: Perhaps I ought here to observe that my feelings towards this man were those of positive dislike , if not hatred ; I never had received one kind word or deed from him , that I could recollect .
Parsing [sent. 106 len. 50]: Harsh and unfeeling towards me , evidently looking upon me with ill-will , and only suffering me because I saved him some trouble , and perhaps because he wished to have a living thing for his companion , -- his feelings towards me were reciprocated by mine towards him .
Parsing [sent. 107 len. 68]: What age I was at the time my mother died , I know not , but I had some faint recollection of one who treated me with kindness and caresses , and these recollections became more forcible in my dreams , when I saw a figure very different from that of my companion -LRB- a female figure -RRB- hanging over me or leading me by the hand .
Parsing [sent. 108 len. 21]: How I used to try to continue those dreams , by closing my eyes again after I had woke up !
Parsing [sent. 109 len. 49]: And yet I knew not that they had been brought about by the dim recollection of my infancy ; I knew not that the figure that appeared to me was the shadow of my mother ; but I loved the dreams because I was treated kindly in them .
Parsing [sent. 110 len. 11]: But a change took place by the hand of Providence .
Parsing [sent. 111 len. 75]: One day , after we had just laid in our yearly provision of sea birds , I was busy arranging the skins of the old birds , on the flat rock , for my annual garment , which was joined together something like a sack , with holes for the head and arms to pass through ; when , as I looked to seaward , I saw a large white object on the water .
Parsing [sent. 112 len. 13]: `` Look , master , '' said I , pointing towards it .
Parsing [sent. 113 len. 8]: `` A ship , a ship ! ''
Parsing [sent. 114 len. 4]: cried my companion .
Parsing [sent. 115 len. 26]: `` Oh , '' thought I , `` that is a ship ; I recollect that he said they came here in a ship . ''
Parsing [sent. 116 len. 12]: I kept my eyes on her , and she rounded to .
Parsing [sent. 117 len. 6]: `` Is she alive ? ''
Parsing [sent. 118 len. 32]: inquired I. `` You 're a fool , '' said the man ; `` come and help me to pile up this wood that we may make a signal to her .
Parsing [sent. 119 len. 18]: Go and fetch some water and throw on it , that there may be plenty of smoke .
Parsing [sent. 120 len. 13]: Thank God , I may leave this cursed hole at last ! ''
Parsing [sent. 121 len. 19]: I hardly understood him , but I went for the water and brought it in the mess kid .
Parsing [sent. 122 len. 11]: `` I want more wood yet , '' said he .
Parsing [sent. 123 len. 14]: `` Her head is this way , and she will come nearer . ''
Parsing [sent. 124 len. 15]: `` Then she is alive , '' said I. `` Away , fool ! ''
Parsing [sent. 125 len. 23]: said he , giving me a cuff on the head ; `` get some more water and throw on the wood . ''
Parsing [sent. 126 len. 30]: He then went into the cabin to strike a light , which he obtained by a piece of iron and flint , with some fine dry moss for tinder .
Parsing [sent. 127 len. 20]: While he was so employed , my eyes were fixed on the vessel , wondering what it could be .
Parsing [sent. 128 len. 12]: It moved through the water , turned this way and that .
Parsing [sent. 129 len. 20]: `` It must be alive , '' thought I ; `` is it a fish or a bird ? ''
Parsing [sent. 130 len. 22]: As I watched the vessel , the sun was going down and there was not more than an hour 's daylight .
Parsing [sent. 131 len. 19]: The wind was very light and variable , which accounted for the vessel so often altering her course .
Parsing [sent. 132 len. 27]: My companion came out with his hands full of smoking tinder , and putting it under the wood , was busy blowing it into a flame .
Parsing [sent. 133 len. 18]: The wood was soon set fire to , and the smoke ascended several feet into the air .
Parsing [sent. 134 len. 10]: `` They 'll see that , '' said he .
Parsing [sent. 135 len. 8]: `` What then , it has eyes ?
Parsing [sent. 136 len. 5]: it must be alive .
Parsing [sent. 137 len. 7]: Does it mind the wind ? ''
Parsing [sent. 138 len. 84]: inquired I , having no answer to my first remark , `` for look there , the little clouds are coming up fast , '' and I pointed to the horizon , where some small clouds were rising up and which were , as I knew from experience and constantly watching the sky , a sign of a short but violent gale , or tornado , of which we usually had one , if not two , at this season of the year .
Parsing [sent. 139 len. 22]: `` Yes ; confound it , '' replied my companion , grinding his teeth , `` it will blow her off !
Parsing [sent. 140 len. 6]: That 's my luck . ''
Parsing [sent. 141 len. 39]: In the meantime , the smoke ascended in the air and the vessel approached nearer and nearer , until she was within , I suppose , two miles of the island , and then it fell quite calm .
Parsing [sent. 142 len. 58]: My companion threw more water on to increase the smoke , and the vessel now hauling up her courses , I perceived that there were people on board , and while I was arranging my ideas as to what the vessel might be , my companion cried out -- `` They see us , they see us !
Parsing [sent. 143 len. 5]: there 's hope now .
Parsing [sent. 144 len. 10]: Confound it , I 've been here long enough .
Parsing [sent. 145 len. 6]: Hurrah for old England ! ''
Parsing [sent. 146 len. 11]: and he commenced dancing and capering about like a madman .
Parsing [sent. 147 len. 24]: At last he said , `` Look out and see if she sends a boat , while I go into the cabin . ''
Parsing [sent. 148 len. 7]: `` What 's a boat ? ''
Parsing [sent. 149 len. 8]: said I. `` Out , you fool !
Parsing [sent. 150 len. 68]: tell me if you see anything , '' `` Yes , I do see something , '' replied I. `` Look at the squall coming along the water , it will be here very soon ; and see how thick the clouds are getting up : we shall have as much wind and rain as we had the time before last , when the birds came . ''
Parsing [sent. 151 len. 43]: `` Confound it , '' replied he , `` I wish they 'd lower a boat , at all events ; '' and so saying , he went into the cabin , and I perceived that he was busy at his bed-place .
Parsing [sent. 152 len. 58]: My eyes were still fixed upon the squall , as I watched it advancing at a furious speed on the surface of the water ; at first it was a deep black line on the horizon , but as it approached the vessel , it changed to white ; the surface of the water was still smooth .
Parsing [sent. 153 len. 63]: The clouds were not more than ten degrees above the horizon , although they were thick and opaque -- but at this season of the year , these tornadoes , as I may call them , visited us ; sometimes we had one , sometimes more , and it was only when these gusts came on that we had any rain below .
Parsing [sent. 154 len. 36]: On board of the vessel -- I speak now from my after knowledge -- they did not appear to be aware of the danger ; the sails were all set and flapping against the masts .
Parsing [sent. 155 len. 25]: At last , I perceived a small object close to the vessel ; this I presumed was the boat which my companion looked for .
Parsing [sent. 156 len. 48]: It was like a young vessel close to the old one , but I said nothing ; as I was watching and wondering what effect the rising wind would have upon her , for the observations of my companion had made me feel that it was important .
Parsing [sent. 157 len. 40]: After a time , I perceived that the white sails were disappearing , and that the forms of men were very busy , and moving on board , and the boat went back to the side of the vessel .
Parsing [sent. 158 len. 54]: The fact is , they had not perceived the squall until it was too late , for in another moment almost , I saw that the vessel bowed down to the fury of the gale , and after that , the mist was so great that I could n't see her any more .
Parsing [sent. 159 len. 10]: `` Is she sending a boat , boy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 160 len. 4]: cried my companion .
Parsing [sent. 161 len. 21]: `` I ca n't see her , '' replied I ; `` for she is hidden by the wind . ''
Parsing [sent. 162 len. 70]: As I said this , the tornado reached to where we stood , and threw me off my legs to the entrance of the cabin ; and with the wind came down a torrent of rain , which drenched us , and the clouds covered the whole of the firmament , which became dark ; the lightning darted in every direction , with peals of thunder which were deafening .
Parsing [sent. 163 len. 23]: I crawled into the cabin , into which the rain beat in great fury and flowed out again in a small river .
Parsing [sent. 164 len. 10]: My companion sat near me , lowering and silent .
Parsing [sent. 165 len. 20]: For two hours the tornado lasted without interruption ; the sun had set , and the darkness was opaque .
Parsing [sent. 166 len. 19]: It was impossible to move against the force of the wind and the deluge of water which descended .
Parsing [sent. 167 len. 39]: Speak , we did not , but shut our eyes against the lightning , and held our fingers to our ears to deaden the noise of the thunder , which burst upon us in the most awful manner .
Parsing [sent. 168 len. 38]: My companion groaned at intervals , whether from fear , I know not ; I had no fear , for I did not know the danger , or that there was a God to judge the earth .
Parsing [sent. 169 len. 36]: Gradually the fury of the gale abated , the rain was only heavy at intervals , and we could now hear the beating of the waves , as they dashed against the rocks beneath us .
Parsing [sent. 170 len. 20]: The sky also cleared up a little , and we could dimly discern the white foam of the breakers .
Parsing [sent. 171 len. 23]: I crawled out of the cabin , and stood upon the platform in front , straining my eyes to see the vessel .
Parsing [sent. 172 len. 42]: A flash of lightning , for a second , revealed her to me ; she was dismasted , rolling in the awful breakers , which bore her down upon the high rocks , not a quarter of a mile from her .
Parsing [sent. 173 len. 25]: `` There it is , '' exclaimed I , as the disappearance of the lightning left me in darkness , more opaque than ever .
Parsing [sent. 174 len. 25]: `` She 's done for , '' growled my companion , who , I was not till then aware , stood by my side .
Parsing [sent. 175 len. 10]: `` No hopes this time , confound it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 176 len. 29]: Then he continued for some time to curse and swear awfully , as I afterwards discovered , for I did not then know what was cursing and swearing .
Parsing [sent. 177 len. 22]: `` There she is again , '' said I , as another flash of lightning revealed the position of the vessel .
Parsing [sent. 178 len. 27]: `` Yes , and she wo n't be there long ; in five minutes she 'll be dashed to atoms , and every soul perish . ''
Parsing [sent. 179 len. 6]: `` What are souls ? ''
Parsing [sent. 180 len. 9]: inquired I. My companion gave me no reply .
Parsing [sent. 181 len. 21]: `` I will go down to the rocks , '' said I , `` and see what goes on . ''
Parsing [sent. 182 len. 14]: `` Go , '' said he , `` and share their fate . ''
Parsing [sent. 183 len. 46]: Chapter III I left him , and commenced a careful descent of the precipices by which we were surrounded , but , before I had gone fifty paces , another flash of lightning was followed up by a loud shriek , which arrested my steps .
Parsing [sent. 184 len. 23]: Where the noise came from , I could not tell , but I heard my companion calling to me to come back .
Parsing [sent. 185 len. 14]: I obeyed him , and found him standing where I had left him .
Parsing [sent. 186 len. 8]: `` You called me , master ? ''
Parsing [sent. 187 len. 18]: `` Yes , I did ; take my hand , and lead me to the cabin . ''
Parsing [sent. 188 len. 13]: I obeyed him , wondering why he asked me so to do .
Parsing [sent. 189 len. 12]: He gained his bed-place , and threw himself down on it .
Parsing [sent. 190 len. 16]: `` Bring the kid full of water , '' said he -- `` quick ! ''
Parsing [sent. 191 len. 12]: I brought it , and he bathed his head and face .
Parsing [sent. 192 len. 16]: After a time , he threw himself back upon the bed-place , and groaned heavily .
Parsing [sent. 193 len. 4]: `` O God !
Parsing [sent. 194 len. 13]: it 's all over with me , '' said he at last .
Parsing [sent. 195 len. 12]: `` I shall live and die in this cursed hole . ''
Parsing [sent. 196 len. 9]: `` What 's the matter , master ? ''
Parsing [sent. 197 len. 3]: said I .
Parsing [sent. 198 len. 13]: He gave me no answer , but lay groaning and occasionally cursing .
Parsing [sent. 199 len. 15]: After a time , he was still , and then I went out again .
Parsing [sent. 200 len. 30]: The tornado was now over , and the stars were to be seen here and there , but still the wind was strong and the wild clouds flew fast .
Parsing [sent. 201 len. 25]: The shores of the island were one mass of foam , which was dashed high in the air and fell upon the black rocks .
Parsing [sent. 202 len. 26]: I looked for the vessel , and could see nothing -- the day was evidently dawning , and I sat down and waited its coming .
Parsing [sent. 203 len. 14]: My companion was apparently asleep , for he lay without motion or noise .
Parsing [sent. 204 len. 35]: That some misfortune had happened , I was convinced , but what , I knew not , and I passed a long time in conjecture , dividing my thoughts between him and the vessel .
Parsing [sent. 205 len. 23]: At last the daylight appeared -- the weather was moderating fast , although the waves still beat furiously against the rocky shore .
Parsing [sent. 206 len. 42]: I could see nothing of the vessel , and I descended the path , now slippery and insecure from the heavy fall of rain , and went as near to the edge of the rocks as the breaking billows would permit .
Parsing [sent. 207 len. 21]: I walked along , occasionally drenched by the spray , until I arrived where I had last seen the vessel .
Parsing [sent. 208 len. 76]: The waves were dashing and tossing about , as if in sport , fragments of timber , casks , and spars ; but that was all I could see , except a mast and rigging , which lay alongside of the rocks , sometimes appearing above them on the summit of the waves , then descending far out of my sight , for I dared not venture near enough to the edge to look over .
Parsing [sent. 209 len. 26]: `` Then the vessel is dashed to pieces , as my companion said , '' thought I. `` I wonder how she was made . ''
Parsing [sent. 210 len. 17]: I remained about an hour on the rocks , and then turned back to the cabin .
Parsing [sent. 211 len. 10]: I found my companion awake , and groaning heavily .
Parsing [sent. 212 len. 20]: `` There is no ship , '' said I , `` nothing but pieces of wood floating about . ''
Parsing [sent. 213 len. 18]: `` I know that , '' replied he ; `` but what do I care now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 214 len. 15]: `` I thought by your making a smoke , that you did care . ''
Parsing [sent. 215 len. 24]: `` Yes , I did then , but now I am blind , I shall never see a ship or anything else again .
Parsing [sent. 216 len. 4]: God help me !
Parsing [sent. 217 len. 11]: I shall die and rot on this cursed island . ''
Parsing [sent. 218 len. 8]: `` Blind , what is blind ? ''
Parsing [sent. 219 len. 50]: inquired I. `` The lightning has burned out my eyes , and I can see nothing -- I can not help myself -- I can not walk about -- I can not do anything , and I suppose you will leave me here to die like a dog . ''
Parsing [sent. 220 len. 8]: `` Ca n't you see me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 221 len. 21]: `` No , all is dark , dark as night , and will be as long as I live . ''
Parsing [sent. 222 len. 9]: And he turned on his bed-place and groaned .
Parsing [sent. 223 len. 36]: `` I had hope , I lived in hope -- it has kept me alive for many weary years , but now hope is gone , and I care not if I die to-morrow . ''
Parsing [sent. 224 len. 24]: And then he started up and turned his face towards me , and I saw that there was no light in his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 225 len. 12]: `` Bring me some more water , do you hear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 226 len. 5]: said he , angrily .
Parsing [sent. 227 len. 11]: `` Be quick , or I 'll make you . ''
Parsing [sent. 228 len. 14]: But I now fully comprehended his condition , and how powerless he was .
Parsing [sent. 229 len. 27]: My feelings , as I have before said , were anything but cordial towards him , and this renewed violence and threatening manner had its effect .
Parsing [sent. 230 len. 18]: I was now , I suppose , about twelve or thirteen years old -- strong and active .
Parsing [sent. 231 len. 17]: I had more than once felt inclined to rebel , and measure my strength against his .
Parsing [sent. 232 len. 20]: Irritated , therefore , at his angry language , I replied -- `` Go for the water yourself . ''
Parsing [sent. 233 len. 4]: `` Ah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 234 len. 17]: sighed he , after a pause of some seconds , `` that I might have expected .
Parsing [sent. 235 len. 18]: But let me once get you into my hands , I 'll make you remember it . ''
Parsing [sent. 236 len. 24]: `` I care not if I were in your hands , '' replied I ; `` I am as strong as you . ''
Parsing [sent. 237 len. 15]: For I had thought so many a day , and meant to prove it .
Parsing [sent. 238 len. 3]: `` Indeed !
Parsing [sent. 239 len. 11]: well , come here , and let us try . ''
Parsing [sent. 240 len. 50]: `` No , no , '' replied I ; `` I 'm not such a fool as you say I am -- not that I 'm afraid of you ; for I shall have an axe in my hand always ready , and you will not find another . ''
Parsing [sent. 241 len. 34]: `` I wish that I had tossed you over the cliffs when you were a child , '' said he , bitterly , `` instead of nursing you and bringing you up . ''
Parsing [sent. 242 len. 11]: `` Then why have you not been kind to me ?
Parsing [sent. 243 len. 31]: As far back as I can remember you have always treated me ill ; you have made me work for you ; and yet never even spoken kindly to me .
Parsing [sent. 244 len. 29]: I have wanted to know things , and you have never answered my questions , but called me a fool , and told me to hold my tongue .
Parsing [sent. 245 len. 24]: You have made me hate you , and you have often told me how you hated me -- you know you have . ''
Parsing [sent. 246 len. 18]: `` It 's true , quite true , '' replied he , as if talking to himself .
Parsing [sent. 247 len. 15]: `` I have done all that he says , and I have hated him .
Parsing [sent. 248 len. 6]: But I have had cause .
Parsing [sent. 249 len. 6]: Come here , boy . ''
Parsing [sent. 250 len. 13]: `` No , '' replied I ; `` do you come here .
Parsing [sent. 251 len. 14]: You have been master , and I have been boy , long enough .
Parsing [sent. 252 len. 17]: Now I am master and you are boy , and you shall find it so . ''
Parsing [sent. 253 len. 14]: Having said this , I walked out of the cabin and left him .
Parsing [sent. 254 len. 34]: He cried out , `` Do n't leave me , '' but I heeded him not , and sat down at the edge of the fiat ledge of the rock before the cabin .
Parsing [sent. 255 len. 26]: Looking at the white dancing waves , and deep in my own thoughts , I considered a long while how I should behave towards him .
Parsing [sent. 256 len. 18]: I did not wish him to die , as I knew he must if I left him .
Parsing [sent. 257 len. 18]: He could not obtain water from the rill without a great chance of falling over the cliff .
Parsing [sent. 258 len. 48]: In fact , I was now fully aware of his helpless state ; to prove it to myself , I rose and shut my own eyes ; tried if I could venture to move on such dangerous ground , and I felt sure that I could not .
Parsing [sent. 259 len. 21]: He was then in my power ; he could do nothing ; he must trust to me for almost everything .
Parsing [sent. 260 len. 36]: I had said , let what would follow , I would be master and he boy ; but that could not be , as I must still attend upon him , or he would die .
Parsing [sent. 261 len. 37]: At last the thought came suddenly upon me -- I will be master , nevertheless , for now he shall answer me all my questions , tell me all he knows , or he shall starve .
Parsing [sent. 262 len. 6]: He is in my power .
Parsing [sent. 263 len. 20]: He shall now do what I have ever tried to make him do , and he has ever refused .
Parsing [sent. 264 len. 46]: Having thus arranged my plans , I returned to the cabin , and said to him : `` Hear what I say -- I will be kind to you , and not leave you to starve , if you will do what I ask . ''
Parsing [sent. 265 len. 7]: `` And what is that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 266 len. 3]: replied he .
Parsing [sent. 267 len. 20]: `` For a long while I have asked you many questions , and you have refused to answer them .
Parsing [sent. 268 len. 26]: Instead of telling me what I would know , you have beaten or thrown stones at me , called me names , and threatened me .
Parsing [sent. 269 len. 38]: I now give you your choice -- either you shall promise to answer every question that I put to you , or you may live how you can , for I shall leave you to help yourself .
Parsing [sent. 270 len. 30]: If you do as I wish , I will do all I can to help you , but if you will not , thank yourself for what may happen .
Parsing [sent. 271 len. 13]: Recollect , I am master now ; so take your choice . ''
Parsing [sent. 272 len. 23]: `` Well , '' replied he slowly , `` it 's a judgment upon me , and I must agree to it .
Parsing [sent. 273 len. 8]: I will do what you wish . ''
Parsing [sent. 274 len. 28]: `` Well , then , to begin , '' said I , `` I have often asked you what your name was , and what was mine .
Parsing [sent. 275 len. 18]: I must call you something , and Master I will not , for I am master now .
Parsing [sent. 276 len. 6]: What is your name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 277 len. 16]: He groaned , ground his teeth , and then said , `` Edward Jackson . ''
Parsing [sent. 278 len. 4]: `` Edward Jackson !
Parsing [sent. 279 len. 8]: very well ; and my name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 280 len. 10]: `` No , I can not bear the name .
Parsing [sent. 281 len. 12]: I can not say it , '' replied he , angrily .
Parsing [sent. 282 len. 15]: `` Be it so , '' replied I. `` Then I leave you . ''
Parsing [sent. 283 len. 11]: `` Will you bring me some water for my eyes ?
Parsing [sent. 284 len. 7]: they burn , '' said he .
Parsing [sent. 285 len. 19]: `` No , I will not , nor anything else , unless you tell me my name . ''
Parsing [sent. 286 len. 10]: `` Frank Henniker -- and curses on it . ''
Parsing [sent. 287 len. 4]: `` Frank Henniker .
Parsing [sent. 288 len. 10]: Well , now you shall have the water . ''
Parsing [sent. 289 len. 31]: I went out , filled a kid , and put it by his side , `` There is the water , Jackson ; if you want anything , call me .
Parsing [sent. 290 len. 6]: I shall be outside . ''
Parsing [sent. 291 len. 20]: `` I have gained the mastery , '' thought I , -- `` it will be my turn now .
Parsing [sent. 292 len. 16]: He do n't like to answer , but he shall , or he shall starve .
Parsing [sent. 293 len. 10]: Why does he feel so angry at my name ?
Parsing [sent. 294 len. 2]: Henniker !
Parsing [sent. 295 len. 10]: what is the meaning of Henniker , I wonder ?
Parsing [sent. 296 len. 7]: I will make him tell me .
Parsing [sent. 297 len. 9]: Yes , he shall tell me everything . ''
Parsing [sent. 298 len. 19]: I may here observe , that as for pity and compassion , I did not know such feelings .
Parsing [sent. 299 len. 26]: I had been so ill-treated , that I only felt that might was right ; and this right I determined upon exercising to the utmost .
Parsing [sent. 300 len. 19]: I felt an inconceivable pleasure at the idea of my being the master , and he the boy .
Parsing [sent. 301 len. 12]: I felt the love of power , the pride of superiority .
Parsing [sent. 302 len. 23]: I then revolved in my mind the daily task which I would set him , before he should receive his daily sustenance .
Parsing [sent. 303 len. 16]: He should talk now as much as I pleased , for I was the master .
Parsing [sent. 304 len. 19]: I had been treated as a slave , and I was now fully prepared to play the tyrant .
Parsing [sent. 305 len. 7]: Mercy and compassion I knew not .
Parsing [sent. 306 len. 14]: I had never seen them called forth , and I felt them not .
Parsing [sent. 307 len. 54]: I sat down on the flat rock for some time , and then it occurred to me that I would turn the course of the water which fell into the hole at the edge of the cliff ; so that if he crawled there , he would not be able to obtain any .
Parsing [sent. 308 len. 9]: I did so , and emptied the hole .
Parsing [sent. 309 len. 24]: The water was now only to be obtained by climbing up , and it was out of his power to obtain a drop .
Parsing [sent. 310 len. 40]: Food , of course , he could obtain , as the dried birds were all piled up at the farther end of the cabin , and I could not well remove them ; but what was food without water ?
Parsing [sent. 311 len. 81]: I was turning in my mind what should be the first question to put to him ; and I had decided that I would have a full and particular account of how the vessel had been wrecked on the island , and who were my father and mother , and why I was named Henniker -- when I was roused by hearing Jackson -LRB- as I shall in future call him -RRB- crying out , `` Boy , boy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 312 len. 21]: `` Boy , indeed , '' thought I -- `` no longer boy , '' and I gave no reply .
Parsing [sent. 313 len. 33]: Again he called , and at last he cried out , `` Henniker , '' but I had been ruffled by his calling me boy , and I would not answer him .
Parsing [sent. 314 len. 13]: At last he fairly screamed my name , and then was silent .
Parsing [sent. 315 len. 62]: After a moment , I perceived that he crawled out of his bed-place , and feeling by the sides of the cabin , contrived on his hands and knees to crawl in the direction of the hole into which the water had previously been received ; and I smiled at what I knew would be his disappointment when he arrived there .
Parsing [sent. 316 len. 48]: He did so at last : put his hand to feel the edge of the hole , and then down into it to feel for the water ; and when he found that there was none , he cursed bitterly , and I laughed at his vexation .
Parsing [sent. 317 len. 32]: He then felt all the way down where the water had fallen , and found that the course of it had been stopped , and he dared not attempt anything further .
Parsing [sent. 318 len. 9]: He dashed his clenched hand against the rock .
Parsing [sent. 319 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 320 len. 16]: that I had him in this grasp -- if it were but for one moment .
Parsing [sent. 321 len. 11]: I would not care if I died the next . ''
Parsing [sent. 322 len. 31]: `` I do not doubt you , '' replied I to him , above , `` but you have not got me in your hands , and you will not .
Parsing [sent. 323 len. 27]: Go in to bed directly -- quick , '' cried I , throwing a piece of rock at him , which hit him on the head .
Parsing [sent. 324 len. 22]: `` Crawl back as fast as you can , you fool , or I 'll send another at your head directly .
Parsing [sent. 325 len. 14]: I 'll tame you , as you used to say to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 326 len. 31]: The blow on the head appeared to have confused him ; but after a time he crawled back to his bed-place , and threw himself down with a heavy groan .
Parsing [sent. 327 len. 39]: Chapter IV I then went down to the water 's edge to see if I could find anything from the wreck , for the water was smooth , and no longer washed over the rocks of the island .
Parsing [sent. 328 len. 70]: Except fragments of wood , I perceived nothing until I arrived at the pool where we were accustomed to bathe ; and I found that the sea had thrown into it two articles of large dimensions -- one was a cask of the size of a puncheon , which lay in about a foot of water farthest from the seaward ; and the other was a seaman 's chest .
Parsing [sent. 329 len. 30]: What these things were I did not then know , and I wish the reader to recollect that a great portion of this narrative is compiled from after knowledge .
Parsing [sent. 330 len. 15]: The cask was firm in the sand , and I could not move it .
Parsing [sent. 331 len. 21]: The chest was floating ; I hauled it on the rocks without difficulty , and then proceeded to open it .
Parsing [sent. 332 len. 57]: It was some time before I could discover how , for I had never seen a lock , or a hinge in my life ; but at last , finding that the lid was the only portion of the chest which yielded , I contrived , with a piece of rock , to break it open .
Parsing [sent. 333 len. 37]: I found in it a quantity of seamen 's clothes , upon which I put no value ; but some of the articles I immediately comprehended the use of , and they filled me with delight .
Parsing [sent. 334 len. 13]: There were two new tin pannikins , and those would hold water .
Parsing [sent. 335 len. 29]: There were three empty wine bottles , a hammer , a chisel , gimlet , and some other tools , also three or four fishing-lines many fathoms long .
Parsing [sent. 336 len. 45]: But what pleased me most were two knives , one shutting up , with a lanyard sheath to wear round the waist ; and the other an American long knife , in a sheath , which is usually worn by them in the belt .
Parsing [sent. 337 len. 59]: Now , three or four years back , Jackson had the remains of a clasp knife -- that is , there was about an inch of the blade remaining -- and this , as may be supposed , he valued very much ; indeed , miserable as the article was , in our destitute state it was invaluable .
Parsing [sent. 338 len. 36]: This knife he had laid on the rock when fishing , and it had been dragged into the sea as his line ran out ; and he was for many days inconsolable for its loss .
Parsing [sent. 339 len. 28]: We had used it for cutting open the birds when we skinned them , and , indeed this remains of a knife had been always in request .
Parsing [sent. 340 len. 34]: Since the loss of it , we had had hard work to get the skins off the birds ; I therefore well knew the value of these knives , which I immediately secured .
Parsing [sent. 341 len. 48]: The remainder of the articles in the chest , which was quite full , I laid upon the rocks , with the clothes , to dry ; of most of them I did not know the use , and consequently did not prize them at the time .
Parsing [sent. 342 len. 21]: It was not until afterwards , when I had taken them to my companion , that I learned their value .
Parsing [sent. 343 len. 78]: I may as well here observe , that amongst these articles were two books , and , from the positive commands of my companion , not to touch the book in the cabin , I looked upon them with a degree of awe , and hesitated upon taking them in my hand ; but , at last , I put them out to dry on the rocks , with the rest of the contents of the chest .
Parsing [sent. 344 len. 81]: I felt the knives , the blades were sharp ; I put the lanyard of the clasp knife round my neck ; the sheath knife , which was a formidable weapon , I made fast round my waist , with a piece of the fishing lines , which I cut off ; and I then turned my steps towards the cabin , as night was coming on , though the moon was high in the heavens , and shining brightly .
Parsing [sent. 345 len. 34]: On my return , I found Jackson in his bed-place ; he heard me come in , and asked me , in a quiet tone , whether I would bring him some water ?
Parsing [sent. 346 len. 33]: I answered , `` No , that I would not , for what he had said about me , and what he would do , if he got me into his power .
Parsing [sent. 347 len. 20]: I 'll tame you , '' cried I. `` I 'm master now , as you shall find . ''
Parsing [sent. 348 len. 29]: `` You may be , '' replied he , quickly , `` but still , that is no reason why you should not let me have some water .
Parsing [sent. 349 len. 10]: Did I ever prevent you from having water ? ''
Parsing [sent. 350 len. 24]: `` You never had to fetch it for me , '' I rejoined , `` or you would not have taken the trouble .
Parsing [sent. 351 len. 18]: What trouble would you take for me , if I were blind now , and not you ?
Parsing [sent. 352 len. 17]: I should become of no use to you , and you would leave me to die .
Parsing [sent. 353 len. 19]: You only let me live that you might make me work for you , and beat me cruelly .
Parsing [sent. 354 len. 18]: It 's my turn now -- you 're the boy , and I 'm the master . ''
Parsing [sent. 355 len. 51]: The reader must remember that I did not know the meaning of the word `` boy '' ; my idea of it was , that it was in opposition to `` master , '' and boy , with me , had the same idea as the word `` slave . ''
Parsing [sent. 356 len. 11]: `` Be it so , '' replied he , calmly .
Parsing [sent. 357 len. 9]: `` I shall not want water long . ''
Parsing [sent. 358 len. 60]: There was a quietness about Jackson which made me suspect him , and the consequence was , that although I turned into my bed-place , which was on the ground at the side of the cabin opposite to his , I did not feel inclined to go to sleep , but remained awake , thinking of what had passed .
Parsing [sent. 359 len. 28]: It was towards morning when I heard him move ; my face being turned that way , I had no occasion to stir to watch his motions .
Parsing [sent. 360 len. 28]: He crept very softly out of his bed-place towards me , listening , and advancing on his knees , not more than a foot every ten seconds .
Parsing [sent. 361 len. 44]: `` You want me in your grasp , '' thought I , `` come along , '' and I drew my American knife from its sheath , without noise , and awaited his approach , smiling at the surprise he would meet with .
Parsing [sent. 362 len. 29]: I allowed him to come right up to me ; he felt the side of my bed , and then passed his right hand over to seize me .
Parsing [sent. 363 len. 26]: I caught his right hand with my left , and passing the knife across his wrist , more than half divided it from his arm .
Parsing [sent. 364 len. 13]: He gave a shriek of surprise and pain , and fell back .
Parsing [sent. 365 len. 22]: `` He has a knife , '' exclaimed he , with surprise , holding his severed wrist with the other hand .
Parsing [sent. 366 len. 29]: `` Yes , he has a knife , and more than one , '' replied I , `` and you see that he knows how to use it .
Parsing [sent. 367 len. 5]: Will you come again ?
Parsing [sent. 368 len. 10]: or will you believe that I 'm master ? ''
Parsing [sent. 369 len. 36]: `` If you have any charity or mercy , kill me at once , '' said he , as he sat up in the moonlight , in the centre of the floor of the cabin .
Parsing [sent. 370 len. 14]: `` Charity and mercy , '' said I , `` what are they ?
Parsing [sent. 371 len. 7]: I never heard of them . ''
Parsing [sent. 372 len. 3]: `` Alas !
Parsing [sent. 373 len. 33]: no , '' replied he , `` I have shewed none -- it 's a judgment on me -- a judgment on me for my many sins ; Lord , forgive me !
Parsing [sent. 374 len. 10]: First my eyes , now my right hand useless .
Parsing [sent. 375 len. 9]: What next , O Lord of Heaven ? ''
Parsing [sent. 376 len. 20]: `` Why , your other hand next , '' replied I , `` if you try it again . ''
Parsing [sent. 377 len. 5]: Jackson made no reply .
Parsing [sent. 378 len. 27]: He attempted to crawl back to his bed , but , faint with loss of blood , he dropped senseless on the floor of the cabin .
Parsing [sent. 379 len. 26]: I looked at him , and satisfied that he would make no more attempts upon me , I turned away , and fell fast asleep .
Parsing [sent. 380 len. 27]: In about two hours , I awoke , and looking round , perceived him lying on the floor , where he had fallen the night before .
Parsing [sent. 381 len. 17]: I went to him and examined him -- was he asleep , or was he dead ?
Parsing [sent. 382 len. 8]: He lay in a pool of blood .
Parsing [sent. 383 len. 10]: I felt him , and he was quite warm .
Parsing [sent. 384 len. 29]: It was a ghastly cut on his wrist , and I thought , if he is dead , he will never tell me what I want to know .
Parsing [sent. 385 len. 12]: I knew that he bound up cuts to stop the blood .
Parsing [sent. 386 len. 16]: I took some feathers from the bed , and put a handful on the wound .
Parsing [sent. 387 len. 36]: After I had done it , I bound his wrist up with a piece of fishing-line I had taken to secure the sheath knife round my waist , and then I went for some water .
Parsing [sent. 388 len. 17]: I poured some down his throat ; this revived him , and he opened his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 389 len. 6]: `` Where am I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 390 len. 4]: said he faintly .
Parsing [sent. 391 len. 5]: `` Where are you ?
Parsing [sent. 392 len. 18]: -- why , in the cabin , '' said I. `` Give me some more water . ''
Parsing [sent. 393 len. 13]: I did so , for I did not wish to kill him .
Parsing [sent. 394 len. 13]: I wanted him to live , and to be in my power .
Parsing [sent. 395 len. 15]: After drinking the water he roused himself , and crawled back to his bed-place .
Parsing [sent. 396 len. 11]: I left him then , and went down to bathe .
Parsing [sent. 397 len. 23]: The reader may exclaim -- What a horrid tyrant this boy is -- why , he is as bad as his companion .
Parsing [sent. 398 len. 19]: Exactly -- I was so -- but let the reader reflect that I was made so by education .
Parsing [sent. 399 len. 23]: From the time that I could first remember , I had been tyrannised over ; cuffed , kicked , abused and ill-treated .
Parsing [sent. 400 len. 6]: I had never known kindness .
Parsing [sent. 401 len. 19]: Most truly was the question put by me , `` Charity and mercy -- what are they ? ''
Parsing [sent. 402 len. 6]: I never heard of them .
Parsing [sent. 403 len. 54]: An American Indian has kind feelings -- he is hospitable and generous -- yet , educated to inflict , and receive , the severest tortures to and from , his enemies , he does the first with the most savage and vindictive feelings , and submits to the latter with indifference and stoicism .
Parsing [sent. 404 len. 20]: He has , indeed , the kindlier feelings of his nature exercised ; still , this changes him not .
Parsing [sent. 405 len. 21]: He has been from earliest infancy brought up to cruelty , and he can not feel that it is wrong .
Parsing [sent. 406 len. 7]: Now , my position was worse .
Parsing [sent. 407 len. 26]: I had never seen the softer feelings of our nature called into play ; I knew nothing but tyranny and oppression , hatred and vengeance .
Parsing [sent. 408 len. 23]: It was therefore not surprising that , when my turn came , I did to others as I had been done by .
Parsing [sent. 409 len. 19]: Jackson had no excuse for his treatment of me , whereas , I had every excuse for retaliation .
Parsing [sent. 410 len. 9]: He did know better , I did not .
Parsing [sent. 411 len. 18]: I followed the ways of the world in the petty microcosm in which I had been placed .
Parsing [sent. 412 len. 14]: I knew not of mercy , of forgiveness , charity , or goodwill .
Parsing [sent. 413 len. 40]: I knew not that there was a God ; I only knew that might was right , and the most pleasurable sensation which I felt , was that of anxiety for vengeance , combined with the consciousness of power .
Parsing [sent. 414 len. 14]: After I had bathed , I again examined the chest and its contents .
Parsing [sent. 415 len. 9]: I looked at the books without touching them .
Parsing [sent. 416 len. 19]: `` I must know what these mean , '' thought I , `` and I will know . ''
Parsing [sent. 417 len. 61]: My thirst for knowledge was certainly most remarkable , in a boy of my age ; I presume for the simple reason , that we want most what we can not obtain ; and Jackson having invariably refused to enlighten me on any subject , I became most anxious and impatient to satisfy the longing which increased with my growth .
Parsing [sent. 418 len. 25]: Chapter V For three days did Jackson lie on his bed ; I supplied him with water , but he did not eat anything .
Parsing [sent. 419 len. 27]: He groaned heavily at times , and talked much to himself , and I heard him ask forgiveness of God , and pardon for his sins .
Parsing [sent. 420 len. 8]: I noted this down for an explanation .
Parsing [sent. 421 len. 18]: On the third day , he said to me , `` Henniker , I am very ill .
Parsing [sent. 422 len. 15]: I have a fever coming on , from the wound you have given me .
Parsing [sent. 423 len. 45]: I do not say that I did not deserve it , for I did , and I know that I have treated you ill , and that you must hate me , but the question is , do you wish me to die ? ''
Parsing [sent. 424 len. 27]: `` No , '' replied I ; `` I want you to live , and answer all my questions , and you shall do so . ''
Parsing [sent. 425 len. 10]: `` I will do so , '' replied he .
Parsing [sent. 426 len. 12]: `` I have done wrong , and I will make amends .
Parsing [sent. 427 len. 5]: Do you understand me ?
Parsing [sent. 428 len. 40]: I mean to say , that I have been very cruel to you , and now I will do all you wish , and answer every question you may put to me , as well as I can . ''
Parsing [sent. 429 len. 28]: `` That is what I want , '' replied I. `` I know it is , but my wound is festering and must be washed and dressed .
Parsing [sent. 430 len. 6]: The feathers make it worse .
Parsing [sent. 431 len. 8]: Will you do this for me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 432 len. 22]: I thought a little , and recollected that he was still in my power , as he could not obtain water .
Parsing [sent. 433 len. 10]: I replied , `` Yes , I will . ''
Parsing [sent. 434 len. 13]: `` The cord hurts it , you must take it off . ''
Parsing [sent. 435 len. 36]: I fetched the kid of water , and untied the cord , and took away the feathers , which had matted together with the flow of blood , and then I washed the wound carefully .
Parsing [sent. 436 len. 28]: Looking into the wound , my desire of information induced me to say , `` What are these little white cords , which are cut through ? ''
Parsing [sent. 437 len. 43]: `` They are the sinews and tendons , '' replied he , `` by which we are enabled to move our hands and fingers ; now these are cut through , I shall not have the use of my hand again . ''
Parsing [sent. 438 len. 21]: `` Stop a moment , '' said I , rising up , `` I have just thought of something . ''
Parsing [sent. 439 len. 36]: I ran down to the point where the chest lay , took a shirt from the rock , and brought it back with me , and tearing it into strips , I bandaged the wound .
Parsing [sent. 440 len. 9]: `` Where did you get that linen ? ''
Parsing [sent. 441 len. 3]: said Jackson .
Parsing [sent. 442 len. 4]: I told him .
Parsing [sent. 443 len. 18]: `` And you got the knife there , too , '' said he , with a sigh .
Parsing [sent. 444 len. 6]: I replied in the affirmative .
Parsing [sent. 445 len. 24]: As soon as I had finished , he told me he was much easier , and said , `` I thank you . ''
Parsing [sent. 446 len. 8]: `` What is I thank you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 447 len. 16]: replied I. `` It means that I am grateful for what you have done . ''
Parsing [sent. 448 len. 7]: `` And what is grateful ? ''
Parsing [sent. 449 len. 4]: inquired I again .
Parsing [sent. 450 len. 11]: `` You never said those words to me before . ''
Parsing [sent. 451 len. 18]: `` Alas , no , '' replied he ; `` it had been better if I had .
Parsing [sent. 452 len. 28]: I mean that I feel kindly towards you , for having bound up my wound , and would do anything for you if I had the power .
Parsing [sent. 453 len. 41]: It means , that if I had my eyesight , as I had a week ago , and was master , as I then was , that I would not kick nor beat you , but be kind to you .
Parsing [sent. 454 len. 6]: Do you understand me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 455 len. 29]: `` Yes , '' replied I , `` I think I do ; and if you tell me all I want to know I shall believe you . ''
Parsing [sent. 456 len. 35]: `` That I will as soon as I am well enough ; but now I am too ill -- you must wait a day or two , till the fever has left me . ''
Parsing [sent. 457 len. 23]: Satisfied with Jackson 's promise , I tended him carefully , and washed and dressed his wound for the two following days .
Parsing [sent. 458 len. 90]: He said that he felt himself much better , and his language to me was so kind and conciliatory , that I hardly knew what to make of it ; but this is certain , that it had a good effect upon me , and gradually the hatred and ill-will that I bore to him wore off , and I found myself handling him tenderly , and anxious not to give him more pain than was necessary , yet without being aware that I was prompted by better feelings .
Parsing [sent. 459 len. 27]: It was on the third morning that he said , -- `` I can talk to you now ; what do you want to know ? ''
Parsing [sent. 460 len. 36]: `` I want to know the whole story of how we came to this island , who my father and mother were , and why you said that you hated me and my name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 461 len. 21]: `` That , '' said Jackson , after a silence of a few minutes , `` will take some time .
Parsing [sent. 462 len. 22]: I could soon tell it you if it were not for the last question , -- why I hated your name ?
Parsing [sent. 463 len. 24]: But the history of your father is so mixed up with mine , that I can not well tell one without the other .
Parsing [sent. 464 len. 19]: I may as well begin with my own history , and that will be telling you both . ''
Parsing [sent. 465 len. 22]: `` Then tell it me , '' replied I , `` and do not tell me what is not true . ''
Parsing [sent. 466 len. 26]: `` No ; I will tell you exactly what it was , '' replied Jackson ; `` you may as well know it as not .
Parsing [sent. 467 len. 33]: -- Your father and I were both born in England , which you know is your country by birth , and you also know that the language we talk is English . ''
Parsing [sent. 468 len. 7]: `` I did not know it .
Parsing [sent. 469 len. 12]: Tell me something about England before you say any more . ''
Parsing [sent. 470 len. 23]: I will not trouble the reader with Jackson 's description of England , or the many questions which I put to him .
Parsing [sent. 471 len. 19]: It was night-fall before he had finished answering , and before I was satisfied with the information imparted .
Parsing [sent. 472 len. 39]: I believe that he was very glad to hold his tongue , for he complained of being tired , and I dressed his wound and wetted the bandage with cold water for him before he went to sleep .
Parsing [sent. 473 len. 39]: I can hardly describe to the reader the effect which this uninterrupted flow of language had upon me ; I was excited in a very strange way , and for many nights after could not sleep for hours .
Parsing [sent. 474 len. 39]: I may say here , I did not understand a great proportion of the meaning of the words used by Jackson ; but I gathered it from the context , as I could not always be interrupting him .
Parsing [sent. 475 len. 75]: It is astonishing how fast ideas breed ideas , and how a word , the meaning of which I did not understand when it was first used , became by repetition clear and intelligible ; not that I always put the right construction on it , but if I did not find it answer when used at another time to my former interpretation of it , I would then ask and obtain an explanation .
Parsing [sent. 476 len. 8]: This did not however occur very often .
Parsing [sent. 477 len. 32]: As for this first night , I was positively almost drunk with words , and remained nearly the whole of it arranging and fixing the new ideas that I had acquired .
Parsing [sent. 478 len. 21]: My feelings towards Jackson also were changed -- that is , I no longer felt hatred or ill-will against him .
Parsing [sent. 479 len. 91]: These were swallowed up in the pleasure which he had afforded me , and I looked upon him as a treasure beyond all price , -- not but that many old feelings towards him returned at intervals , for they were not so easily disposed of , but still I would not for the world have lost him until I had obtained from him all possible knowledge ; and if his wound did not look well when I removed the bandage , I was much more distressed than he was .
Parsing [sent. 480 len. 20]: Indeed , there was every prospect of our ultimately being friends , from our mutual dependence on each other .
Parsing [sent. 481 len. 58]: It was useless on his part , in his present destitute condition , to nourish feelings of animosity against one on whose good offices he was now so wholly dependant , or on my part , against one who was creating for me , I may say , new worlds for imagination and thought to dwell on .
Parsing [sent. 482 len. 30]: On the following morning , Jackson narrated in substance -LRB- as near as I can recollect -RRB- as follows : -- `` I was not intended for a sailor .
Parsing [sent. 483 len. 54]: I was taught at a good school , and when I was ten years old , I was put into a house of business as a clerk , where I remained at the desk all day long , copying into ledgers and day-books , in fact , writing what was required of me .
Parsing [sent. 484 len. 11]: This house was connected with the South American trade . ''
Parsing [sent. 485 len. 7]: `` Where is South America ? ''
Parsing [sent. 486 len. 54]: said I. `` You had better let me tell my story , '' replied Jackson , `` and after I have done , you can ask any questions you like , but if you stop me , it will take a week to finish it ; yesterday we lost the whole day . ''
Parsing [sent. 487 len. 18]: `` That 's very true , '' replied I , `` then I will do so . ''
Parsing [sent. 488 len. 35]: `` There were two other clerks in the counting-house -- the head clerk , whose name was Manvers , and your father , who was in the counting-house but a few months before me .
Parsing [sent. 489 len. 31]: Our master , whose name was Evelyn , was very particular with both your father and myself , scanning our work daily , and finding fault when we deserved it .
Parsing [sent. 490 len. 25]: This occasioned a rivalry between us , which made us both very active , and I received praise quite as often as he did .
Parsing [sent. 491 len. 17]: On Sunday , Mr Evelyn used to ask your father and me to spend the day .
Parsing [sent. 492 len. 12]: We went to church in the forenoon and dined with him .
Parsing [sent. 493 len. 11]: He had a daughter a little younger than we were .
Parsing [sent. 494 len. 5]: She was your mother .
Parsing [sent. 495 len. 24]: Both of us , as we grew up , were very attentive to her , and anxious to be in her good graces .
Parsing [sent. 496 len. 34]: I can not say which was preferred at first , but I rather think that if anything I was the favourite , during the first two years of our being acquainted with her .
Parsing [sent. 497 len. 21]: I was more lively and a better companion than your father , who was inclined to be grave and thoughtful .
Parsing [sent. 498 len. 45]: We had been about four years in the counting-house , when my mother died -- my father had been dead some time before I went into it -- and at her death I found my share of her property to amount to about L2500 .
Parsing [sent. 499 len. 10]: But I was not yet twenty-one years of age .
Parsing [sent. 500 len. 9]: I could not receive it for another year .
Parsing [sent. 501 len. 105]: Mr Evelyn , who had till then every reason to be satisfied with my conduct , used to joke with me , and say that as soon as I was of age , he would allow me , if I chose it , to put the money in the business , and thus obtain a small share in it -- and such was my intention , and I looked forward to bright prospects and the hope of one day being married to your mother , and I have no doubt but such would have been the case , had I still conducted myself properly .
Parsing [sent. 502 len. 70]: But , before I was of age , I made some very bad acquaintances , and soon ran into expenses which I could not afford -- and the worst was , that I contracted a habit of sitting up late at night , and drinking to excess , which I never have since got over , which proved my ruin then , and has proved my ruin through life .
Parsing [sent. 503 len. 23]: This little fortune of mine not only gave me consequence , but was the cause of my thinking very highly of myself .
Parsing [sent. 504 len. 35]: I now was more particular in my attentions to Miss Evelyn , and was graciously received by her father ; neither had I any reason to complain of my treatment from the young lady .
Parsing [sent. 505 len. 13]: As for your father , he was quite thrown into the back-ground .
Parsing [sent. 506 len. 102]: He had no property nor hope of any , except what he might hereafter secure by his diligence and good conduct ; and the attention I received from Mr Evelyn , and also the head clerk , who had an idea that I was to be a partner and consequently would become his superior , made him very melancholy and unhappy -- for I believe that then he was quite as much in love with Miss Evelyn as I was myself ; and I must tell you , that my love for her was unbounded , and she well deserved it .
Parsing [sent. 507 len. 12]: But all these happy prospects were overthrown by my own folly .
Parsing [sent. 508 len. 48]: As soon as it was known that I had property left to me , I was surrounded by many others who requested to be introduced to me , and my evenings were passed in what I considered very good company , but which proved the very reverse .
Parsing [sent. 509 len. 22]: By degrees I took to gambling , and after a time , lost more money than I could afford to pay .
Parsing [sent. 510 len. 27]: This caused me to have recourse to a Jew , who advanced me loans at a large interest to be repaid at my coming of age .
Parsing [sent. 511 len. 23]: Trying to win back my money , I at last found myself indebted to the Jew for the sum of nearly L1000 .
Parsing [sent. 512 len. 13]: The more that I became involved , the more reckless I became .
Parsing [sent. 513 len. 28]: Mr Evelyn perceived that I kept late hours , and looked haggard , as I well might ; indeed , my position had now become very awkward .
Parsing [sent. 514 len. 36]: Mr Evelyn knew well the sum that had been left me , and how was I to account to him for the deficiency , if he proposed that I should put it into the business ?
Parsing [sent. 515 len. 35]: I should be ruined in his opinion , and he never , I was convinced , would entrust the happiness of his daughter to a young man who had been guilty of such irregularities .
Parsing [sent. 516 len. 14]: At the same time , my love for her nearly amounted to adoration .
Parsing [sent. 517 len. 49]: Never was there a more miserable being than I was for the last six months previous to my coming of age , and to drown my misery I plunged into every excess , and seldom , if ever , went to bed but in a state of intoxication .
Parsing [sent. 518 len. 21]: Scheme after scheme did I propose to enable me to conceal my fault , but I could hit upon nothing .
Parsing [sent. 519 len. 83]: The time approached ; I was within a few days of coming of age , when Mr Evelyn sent for me and then spoke to me seriously , saying , that out of regard to the memory of my father , with whom he had been very intimate , he was willing to allow me to embark my little capital in the business , and that he hoped that by my good conduct and application I might soon become a useful partner .
Parsing [sent. 520 len. 17]: I stammered some reply which surprised him ; and he asked me to be more explicit .
Parsing [sent. 521 len. 49]: I stated that I considered my capital too small to be of much use in such a business as his , and that I preferred trying some quick method of doubling it ; that as soon as I had so done I would accept his offer with gratitude .
Parsing [sent. 522 len. 26]: ` As you please , ' replied he coolly ; ` but take care , that in risking all , you do not lose all .
Parsing [sent. 523 len. 24]: Of course , you are your own master , ' and so saying , he left me , apparently much displeased and mortified .
Parsing [sent. 524 len. 10]: But circumstances occurred , which exposed the whole affair .
Parsing [sent. 525 len. 29]: When in company with my evening companions , I stated my intentions of trying my fortune in the East Indies , not seriously , but talking at random .
Parsing [sent. 526 len. 65]: This came to the ears of the Jew of whom I had borrowed the money ; he thought that I intended to leave the kingdom without taking up my bonds , and immediately repaired to Mr Evelyn 's counting-house , to communicate with the head clerk , and ascertain if the report was correct , stating also the sums I was indebted to him .
Parsing [sent. 527 len. 49]: The head clerk informed Mr Evelyn , and on the day upon which I became twenty-one years of age , he sent for me into his private room , and , after some remonstrances , to which I replied very haughtily , it ended in my being dismissed .
Parsing [sent. 528 len. 40]: The fact was , that Mr Evelyn had , since his last interview with me , made inquiries , and finding out I had been living a very riotous life , he had determined upon my leaving his service .
Parsing [sent. 529 len. 58]: As soon as my first burst of indignation was over , I felt what I had lost ; my attachment to Miss Evelyn was stronger than ever , and I bitterly deplored my folly , but after a time , as usual , I had recourse to the bottle , and to drowning my cares in intemperance .
Parsing [sent. 530 len. 50]: I tried very hard to obtain an interview with Miss Evelyn previous to my quitting the house , but this Mr Evelyn would not permit , and a few days after , sent his daughter away , to reside , for a time with a relation in the country .
Parsing [sent. 531 len. 64]: I embarked my capital in the wine trade , and , could I have restrained myself from drinking , should have been successful , and in a short time might have doubled my property , as I stated to Mr Evelyn ; but now , I had become an irreclaimable drunkard , and when that is the case , all hope is over .
Parsing [sent. 532 len. 33]: My affairs soon became deranged , and , at the request of my partner , they were wound up , and I found myself with my capital of L1500 reduced to L1000 .
Parsing [sent. 533 len. 26]: With this , I resolved to try my fortune in shipping ; I procured a share in a brig , and sailed in her myself .
Parsing [sent. 534 len. 30]: After a time , I was sufficiently expert to take the command of her , and might have succeeded , had not my habit of drinking been so confirmed .
Parsing [sent. 535 len. 13]: When at Ceylon , I fell sick , and was left behind .
Parsing [sent. 536 len. 21]: The brig was lost , and as I had forgotten to insure my portion of her , I was ruined .
Parsing [sent. 537 len. 82]: I struggled long , but in vain -- intemperance was my curse , my bane , the millstone at my neck , which dragged me down : I had education , talents , and energy , and at one time , capital , but all were useless ; and thus did I sink down , from captain of a vessel to mate , from mate to second mate , until I at last found myself a drunken sailor before the mast .
Parsing [sent. 538 len. 38]: Such is my general history ; to-morrow , I will let you know how , and in what way , your father and I met again , and what occurred , up to this present time . ''
Parsing [sent. 539 len. 25]: But I was too much bewildered and confused with what he had told me , to allow him to proceed , as he proposed .
Parsing [sent. 540 len. 23]: `` No , no , '' replied I. `` I now recollect all you have said , although I do not understand .
Parsing [sent. 541 len. 19]: You must first answer my questions , as to the meaning of words I never heard of before .
Parsing [sent. 542 len. 37]: I can not understand what money is , what gaming is , and a great many more things you have talked about , but I recollect , and can repeat every word that you have said .
Parsing [sent. 543 len. 31]: To-morrow , I will recall it all over , and you shall tell me what I can not make out ; after that , you can go on again . ''
Parsing [sent. 544 len. 39]: `` Very well , '' replied he , `` I do n't care how long it takes me to answer your questions , for I am not very anxious to tell all about your father and myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 545 len. 22]: Chapter VI I can hardly describe to the reader the effect which these conversations with Jackson had upon me at first .
Parsing [sent. 546 len. 50]: If a prisoner were removed from a dark cell , and all at once introduced into a garden full of fruit and flowers , which he never before had an idea were in existence , he could not have been more filled with wonder , surprise , and pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 547 len. 22]: All was novelty and excitement , but , at the same time , to a great degree , above my comprehension .
Parsing [sent. 548 len. 23]: I had neither language nor ideas to meet it , and yet , I did , to a certain degree , comprehend .
Parsing [sent. 549 len. 25]: I saw not clearly , but sometimes as through a mist , at others through a dark fog , and I could discern little .
Parsing [sent. 550 len. 20]: Every day , however , my increased knowledge of language and terms gave me an increased knowledge of ideas .
Parsing [sent. 551 len. 34]: I gained more by context than I did by any other means , and as I was by degrees enlightened , so my thirst for information and knowledge became every day more insatiable .
Parsing [sent. 552 len. 26]: That much that I considered I understood was erroneous , is certain , for mine was a knowledge , as yet , of theory only .
Parsing [sent. 553 len. 66]: I could imagine to myself , as far as the explanation I received , what such an object might be , and , having made up my ideas on the matter , I was content ; further knowledge , would however incline me to think , and occasionally to decide , that the idea I had formed was incorrect , and I would alter it .
Parsing [sent. 554 len. 17]: Thus did I flounder about in a sea of uncertainty , but still of exciting interest .
Parsing [sent. 555 len. 54]: If any one who has been educated , and has used his eyes in a civilised country , reads an account of people and things hitherto unknown to him , he can , from the description and from his own general knowledge , form a very correct idea of what the country contains .
Parsing [sent. 556 len. 26]: But then he has used his eyes -- he has seen those objects , between which the parallel or the difference has been pointed out .
Parsing [sent. 557 len. 7]: Now I had not that advantage .
Parsing [sent. 558 len. 19]: I had seen nothing but the sea , rocks , and sea-birds , and had but one companion .
Parsing [sent. 559 len. 27]: Here was my great difficulty , which , I may say , was never surmounted , until I had visited and mixed with civilisation and men .
Parsing [sent. 560 len. 10]: The difficulty , however , only increased my ardour .
Parsing [sent. 561 len. 27]: I was naturally of an ingenious mind , I had a remarkable memory , and every increase of knowledge was to me a source of delight .
Parsing [sent. 562 len. 61]: In fact , I had now something to live for , before I had not ; and I verily believe , that if Jackson had been by any chance removed from me at this particular time , I should soon have become a lunatic , from the sudden drying up of the well which supplied my inordinate thirst for knowledge .
Parsing [sent. 563 len. 20]: Some days passed before I asked Jackson to continue his narrative , during which we lived in great harmony .
Parsing [sent. 564 len. 63]: Whether it was that he was deceiving me , and commanding his temper till he had an opportunity of revenge , or whether it was that his forlorn and helpless condition had softened him down , I could not say , but he appeared gradually to be forming an attachment to me ; I was however on my guard at all times .
Parsing [sent. 565 len. 23]: His wounded wrist had now healed up , but his hand was quite useless , as all the tendons had been severed .
Parsing [sent. 566 len. 11]: I had therefore less to fear from him than before .
Parsing [sent. 567 len. 92]: At my request that he would continue his history , Jackson related as follows : -- `` After sailing in vessel after vessel , and generally dismissed after the voyage for my failing of intemperance , I embarked on board a ship bound to Chili , and after having been on the coast for nearly a year , we were about to proceed home with a cargo , when we anchored at Valdivia , previous to our homeward voyage , as we had some few articles to ship at that port .
Parsing [sent. 568 len. 36]: We were again ready for sea , when we heard from the captain , that he had agreed to take two passengers , a gentleman and his wife , who wished to proceed to England .
Parsing [sent. 569 len. 30]: The cabin was cleared out , and every preparation made to receive them on board , and in the evening the boat was sent on shore for the luggage .
Parsing [sent. 570 len. 53]: I went in the boat , as I thought it likely that the gentleman would give the boat 's crew something to drink ; nor was I wrong -- he gave us four dollars , which we spent immediately in one of the ventas , and were all more or less intoxicated .
Parsing [sent. 571 len. 36]: It had been arranged that the luggage should first be carried on board , and after that , we were to return for the passengers , as we were to sail early in the morning .
Parsing [sent. 572 len. 57]: We pulled off with the luggage , but on our arrival on board , I was so drunk , that the captain would not allow me to return in the boat , and I knew nothing of what had passed until I was roused up the next morning to assist in getting the ship under weigh .
Parsing [sent. 573 len. 57]: We had been under weigh two or three hours , and were clearing the land fast , when the gentleman passenger came on neck ; I was then coiling down a rope on the quarter-deck , and as he passed by me , I looked at him , and I recognised him immediately as your father .
Parsing [sent. 574 len. 22]: Years had passed -- from a stripling he had grown a man , but his face was not to be mistaken .
Parsing [sent. 575 len. 19]: There he was , apparently a gentlemen of property and consideration ; and I , what was I ?
Parsing [sent. 576 len. 4]: a drunken sailor .
Parsing [sent. 577 len. 12]: All I hoped was , that he would not recognise me .
Parsing [sent. 578 len. 15]: Shortly afterwards he went down again , and returned escorting his wife on deck .
Parsing [sent. 579 len. 32]: Again I took a furtive curious glance , and perceived at once that she was that Miss Evelyn whom I had once so loved , and by my folly had lost .
Parsing [sent. 580 len. 4]: This was madness .
Parsing [sent. 581 len. 27]: As they stood on the deck enjoying the cool sea breeze , for the weather was delightfully fine , the captain came up and joined them .
Parsing [sent. 582 len. 45]: I was so confused at my discovery , that I knew not what I was about , and I presume was doing something very awkwardly ; for the captain said to me -- ` Jackson , what are you about , you drunken hound ?
Parsing [sent. 583 len. 9]: I suppose you are not sober yet . '
Parsing [sent. 584 len. 51]: At the mention of my name , your father and mother looked at me , and as I lifted up my head to reply to the captain , they eyed me earnestly , and then spoke to each other in a low tone ; after which they interrogated the captain .
Parsing [sent. 585 len. 31]: I could not hear what they said , but I was certain they were talking about me , and that they had suspected , if they had not recognised me .
Parsing [sent. 586 len. 40]: I was ready to sink to the deck , and , at the same time , I felt a hatred of your father enter my heart , of which , during his life , I never could divest myself .
Parsing [sent. 587 len. 53]: It was as I supposed ; your father had recognised me , and the following morning he came up to me as I was leaning over the gunwale amidships , and addressed me , -- ` Jackson , ' said he , ' I am sorry to find you in this situation .
Parsing [sent. 588 len. 12]: You must have been very unfortunate to have become so reduced .
Parsing [sent. 589 len. 35]: If you will confide your history to me , perhaps I may , when we arrive in England , be able to assist you , and it really will give me great pleasure . '
Parsing [sent. 590 len. 10]: I can not say that I replied very cordially .
Parsing [sent. 591 len. 59]: ` Mr Henniker , ' said I , ` you have been fortunate by all appearances , and can therefore afford compassion to those who have not been so ; but , sir , in our positions , I feel as if pity was in reality a sort of triumph , and an offer of assistance an insult .
Parsing [sent. 592 len. 20]: I am content with my present position , and will at all events not change it by your interference .
Parsing [sent. 593 len. 6]: I earn my bread honestly .
Parsing [sent. 594 len. 6]: You can do no more .
Parsing [sent. 595 len. 5]: Times may change yet .
Parsing [sent. 596 len. 12]: It 's a long road that has no turning to it .
Parsing [sent. 597 len. 8]: I wish you a good morning . '
Parsing [sent. 598 len. 22]: So saying , I turned from him , and walked away forward , with my heart full of bitterness and anger .
Parsing [sent. 599 len. 33]: From that hour he never spoke to me or noticed me again , but the captain was more severe upon me , and I ascribed his severity most unjustly to your father .
Parsing [sent. 600 len. 27]: We were about to go round Cape Horn , when the gale from the S.E. came on , which ended in the loss of the vessel .
Parsing [sent. 601 len. 52]: For several days we strove up against it , but at last the vessel , which was old , leaked so much from straining , that we were obliged to bear up and run before it , which we did for several days , the wind and sea continuing without intermission .
Parsing [sent. 602 len. 22]: At last we found ourselves among these islands , and were compelled occasionally to haul to the wind to clear them .
Parsing [sent. 603 len. 50]: This made her leak more and more , until at last she became water logged , and we were forced to abandon her in haste during the night , having no time to take anything with us ; we left three men on board , who were down below .
Parsing [sent. 604 len. 25]: By the mercy of Heaven we ran the boat into the opening below , which was the only spot where we could have landed .
Parsing [sent. 605 len. 20]: I think I had better stop now , as I have a good deal to tell you yet . ''
Parsing [sent. 606 len. 41]: `` Do then , '' replied I ; `` and now I think of it , I will bring up the chest and all the things which were in it , and you shall tell me what they are . ''
Parsing [sent. 607 len. 11]: I went down and returned with the clothes and linen .
Parsing [sent. 608 len. 44]: There were eight pair of trousers , nine shirts , besides the one I had torn up to bandage his wounds with , two pair of blue trousers , and two jackets , four white duck frocks , some shoes , and stockings .
Parsing [sent. 609 len. 21]: Jackson felt them one by one with his hands , and told me what they were , and how worn .
Parsing [sent. 610 len. 11]: `` Why do n't you wear some of them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 611 len. 17]: inquired I. `` If you will give me leave , I will , '' replied he .
Parsing [sent. 612 len. 14]: `` Let me have a duck frock and a pair of trousers . ''
Parsing [sent. 613 len. 22]: I handed the articles to him , and then went back for the rest which I had left on the rocks .
Parsing [sent. 614 len. 26]: When I returned , with my arms full , I found that he had put them on , and his other clothes were beside him .
Parsing [sent. 615 len. 13]: `` I feel more like a Christian now , '' said he .
Parsing [sent. 616 len. 14]: `` A Christian , '' said I , `` what is that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 617 len. 7]: `` I will tell you by-and-bye .
Parsing [sent. 618 len. 18]: It is what I have not been for a long , long while , '' replied he .
Parsing [sent. 619 len. 11]: `` Now , what have you brought this time ? ''
Parsing [sent. 620 len. 13]: `` Here , '' said I , `` what is this ? ''
Parsing [sent. 621 len. 19]: `` This is a roll of duck , to make into frocks and trousers , '' replied he .
Parsing [sent. 622 len. 9]: `` That is bees ' - wax . ''
Parsing [sent. 623 len. 32]: He then explained to me all the tools , sailing-needles , fish-hooks , and fishing-lines , some sheets of writing-paper , and two pens , I had brought up with me .
Parsing [sent. 624 len. 33]: `` All these are very valuable , '' said he , after a pause , `` and would have added much to our comfort , if I had not been blind . ''
Parsing [sent. 625 len. 20]: `` There are more things yet , '' said I ; `` I will go and fetch them . ''
Parsing [sent. 626 len. 14]: This time I replaced the remaining articles , and brought up the chest .
Parsing [sent. 627 len. 28]: It was a heavy load to carry up the rocks , and I was out of breath when I arrived and set it down on the cabin-floor .
Parsing [sent. 628 len. 21]: `` Now , I have the whole of them , '' said I. `` Now , what is this ? ''
Parsing [sent. 629 len. 10]: `` That is a spy-glass -- but , alas !
Parsing [sent. 630 len. 19]: I am blind -- but I will show you how to use it , at all events . ''
Parsing [sent. 631 len. 26]: `` Here are two books , '' said I. `` Give them to me , '' said he , `` and let me feel them .
Parsing [sent. 632 len. 26]: This one is a Bible , I am quite sure by its shape , and the other is , I think , a Prayer-book . ''
Parsing [sent. 633 len. 13]: `` What is a Bible , and what is a Prayer-book ? ''
Parsing [sent. 634 len. 23]: replied I. `` The Bible is the Word of God , and the Prayer-book teaches us how to pray to him . ''
Parsing [sent. 635 len. 6]: `` But who is God ?
Parsing [sent. 636 len. 12]: I have often heard you say , ' O God ! '
Parsing [sent. 637 len. 12]: and ` God damn ' -- but who is he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 638 len. 18]: `` I will tell you to-night before we go to sleep , '' replied Jackson , gravely .
Parsing [sent. 639 len. 9]: `` Very well , I shall remind you .
Parsing [sent. 640 len. 26]: I have found a little box inside the chest , and it is full of all manner of little things -- strings and sinews . ''
Parsing [sent. 641 len. 7]: `` Let me feel them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 642 len. 8]: I put a bundle into his hand .
Parsing [sent. 643 len. 19]: `` These are needles and thread for making and mending clothes -- they will be useful bye-and-bye . ''
Parsing [sent. 644 len. 64]: At last the whole contents of the chest were overhauled and explained : I could not well comprehend the glass bottles , or how they were made , but I put them with the pannikins , and everything else , very carefully into the chest again , and hauled the chest to the farther end of the cabin , out of the way .
Parsing [sent. 645 len. 46]: Before we went to bed that night , Jackson had to explain to me who God was , but as it was only the commencement of several conversations on the subject , I shall not at present trouble the reader with what passed between us .
Parsing [sent. 646 len. 25]: Jackson appeared to be very melancholy after the conversation we had had on religious matters , and was frequently agitated and muttering to himself .
Parsing [sent. 647 len. 45]: Chapter VII I did not on the following day ask him to resume his narrative relative to my father and mother , as I perceived that he avoided it , and I already had so far changed as to have consideration for his feelings .
Parsing [sent. 648 len. 49]: Another point had now taken possession of my mind , which was , whether it were possible to learn to read those books which I had found in the chest , and this was the first question that I put to Jackson when we arose on that morning .
Parsing [sent. 649 len. 7]: `` How is it possible ? ''
Parsing [sent. 650 len. 3]: replied he .
Parsing [sent. 651 len. 13]: `` Am I not blind -- how can I teach you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 652 len. 7]: `` Is there no way ? ''
Parsing [sent. 653 len. 5]: replied I , mournfully .
Parsing [sent. 654 len. 5]: `` Let me think .
Parsing [sent. 655 len. 16]: -- Yes , perhaps there is a way -- at all events we will try .
Parsing [sent. 656 len. 12]: You know which book I told you was the Prayer-book ? ''
Parsing [sent. 657 len. 4]: `` Oh yes !
Parsing [sent. 658 len. 7]: the small , thin one . ''
Parsing [sent. 659 len. 7]: `` Yes -- fetch it here .
Parsing [sent. 660 len. 47]: Now , '' said he , when I put it into his hand , `` tell me ; is there a straight line down the middle of the page of the book , so that the words and letters are on both sides of it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 661 len. 44]: `` Yes , there is , '' replied I ; `` in every page , as you call it , there is a black line down the middle , and words and letters -LRB- I suppose they are -RRB- on both sides . ''
Parsing [sent. 662 len. 23]: `` And among the letters , there are some larger than others , especially at the side nearest to the margin . ''
Parsing [sent. 663 len. 10]: `` I do n't know what margin is . ''
Parsing [sent. 664 len. 17]: `` I mean here , '' replied he , pointing to the margin of the page .
Parsing [sent. 665 len. 7]: `` Yes , there are . ''
Parsing [sent. 666 len. 50]: `` Well then , I will open the book as near as I can guess at the Morning service , and you tell me if you can find any part of the writing which appears to begin with a large round letter , like -- what shall I say ?
Parsing [sent. 667 len. 8]: -- the bottom of a pannikin . ''
Parsing [sent. 668 len. 12]: `` There is one on this leaf , quite round . ''
Parsing [sent. 669 len. 21]: `` Very well -- now get me a small piece of stick , and make a point to it . ''
Parsing [sent. 670 len. 18]: I did so , and Jackson swept away a small place on the floor of the cabin .
Parsing [sent. 671 len. 40]: `` Now , '' said he , `` there are many other prayers which begin with a round O , as the letter is called ; so I must first ascertain if this one is the one I require .
Parsing [sent. 672 len. 27]: If it is , I know it by heart , and by that shall be able to teach you all the letters of the alphabet . ''
Parsing [sent. 673 len. 7]: `` What 's an alphabet ? ''
Parsing [sent. 674 len. 17]: `` The alphabet is the number of letters invented to enable us to read and write .
Parsing [sent. 675 len. 6]: There are twenty-six of them .
Parsing [sent. 676 len. 17]: Now look , Frank ; is the next letter to O the shape of this ? ''
Parsing [sent. 677 len. 14]: and he drew with the pointed stick the letter U on the ground .
Parsing [sent. 678 len. 56]: `` Yes , it is , '' replied I. `` And the next is like this , '' continued he , drawing the letter R , after he had smoothed the ground and effaced the U. `` Yes , '' replied I. `` Well then , to make sure , I had better go on .
Parsing [sent. 679 len. 45]: OUR is one word , and then there is a little space between ; and next you come to an F. '' `` Yes , '' replied I , looking at what he had drawn and comparing it with the letter in the book .
Parsing [sent. 680 len. 25]: `` Then I believe that we are all right , but to make sure , we will go on for a little longer . ''
Parsing [sent. 681 len. 25]: Jackson then completed the word `` Father , '' and `` which art , '' that followed it , and then he was satisfied .
Parsing [sent. 682 len. 33]: `` Now , '' said he , `` out of that prayer I can teach you all the letters , and if you pay attention , you will learn to read . ''
Parsing [sent. 683 len. 21]: The whole morning was passed in my telling him the different letters , and I very soon knew them all .
Parsing [sent. 684 len. 55]: During the day , the Lord 's Prayer was gone through , and as I learnt the words as well as the letters , I could repeat it before night ; I read it over to him twenty or thirty times , spelling every word , letter by letter , until I was perfect .
Parsing [sent. 685 len. 6]: This was my first lesson .
Parsing [sent. 686 len. 11]: `` Why is it called the Lord 's Prayer ? ''
Parsing [sent. 687 len. 43]: said I. `` Because , when our Lord Jesus Christ was asked by His followers in what way they ought to address God , He gave them this prayer to repeat , as being the most proper that they could use . ''
Parsing [sent. 688 len. 8]: `` But who was Jesus Christ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 689 len. 24]: `` He was the Son of God , as I told you yesterday , and at the same time equal with God . ''
Parsing [sent. 690 len. 25]: `` How could he be equal with God , if , as you said yesterday , God sent him down to be killed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 691 len. 27]: `` It was with his own consent that he suffered death ; but all this is a mystery which you can not understand at present . ''
Parsing [sent. 692 len. 7]: `` What 's a mystery ? ''
Parsing [sent. 693 len. 9]: `` That which you can not understand . ''
Parsing [sent. 694 len. 8]: `` Do you understand it yourself ? ''
Parsing [sent. 695 len. 30]: `` No , I do not ; I only know that such is the fact , but it is above not only mine , but all men 's comprehension .
Parsing [sent. 696 len. 52]: But I tell you honestly that , on these points , I am but a bad teacher ; I have paid little attention to them during my life , and as far as religion is concerned , I can only give you the outlines , for I know no more . ''
Parsing [sent. 697 len. 50]: `` But I thought you said , that people were to be punished or rewarded when they died , according as they had lived a bad or good life ; and that to live a good life , people must be religious , and obey God 's commands . ''
Parsing [sent. 698 len. 49]: `` I did tell you so , and I told you the truth ; but I did not tell you that I had led a bad life , as I have done , and that I have neglected to pay obedience to God 's word and command . ''
Parsing [sent. 699 len. 15]: `` Then you will be punished when you die , will you not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 700 len. 3]: `` Alas !
Parsing [sent. 701 len. 22]: I fear so , child , '' replied Jackson , putting his hands up to his forehead and hiding his face .
Parsing [sent. 702 len. 23]: `` But there is still time , '' continued he , after a pause , and `` O God of mercy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 703 len. 10]: exclaimed he , `` how shall I escape ? ''
Parsing [sent. 704 len. 21]: I was about to continue the conversation , but Jackson requested that I would leave him alone for a time .
Parsing [sent. 705 len. 13]: I went out and sat on a rock , watching the stars .
Parsing [sent. 706 len. 35]: `` And those , he says , were all made by God , '' -- `` and God made everything , '' thought I , `` and God lives up beyond those stars . ''
Parsing [sent. 707 len. 12]: I thought for a long while , and was much perplexed .
Parsing [sent. 708 len. 41]: I had never heard anything of God till the night before , and what Jackson had told me was just enough to make me more anxious and curious ; but he evidently did not like to talk on the subject .
Parsing [sent. 709 len. 66]: I tried after a time , if I could repeat the Lord 's Prayer , and I found that I could , so I knelt down on the rock , and looking up to a bright star , as if I would imagine it was God , I repeated the Lord 's Prayer to it , and then I rose up and went to bed .
Parsing [sent. 710 len. 11]: This was the first time that I had ever prayed .
Parsing [sent. 711 len. 88]: I had learnt so much from Jackson , latterly , that I could hardly retain what I had learnt ; at all events , I had a very confused recollection in my brain , and my thoughts turned from one subject to another , till there was , for a time , a perfect chaos ; by degrees things unravelled themselves , and my ideas became more clear ; but still I laboured under that half-comprehension of things , which , in my position , was unavoidable .
Parsing [sent. 712 len. 20]: But now my mind was occupied with one leading object and wish , which was to learn to read .
Parsing [sent. 713 len. 37]: I thought no more of Jackson 's history and the account he might give me of my father and mother , and was as willing as he was that it should be deferred for a time .
Parsing [sent. 714 len. 25]: What I required now was to be able to read the books , and to this object my whole mind and attention were given .
Parsing [sent. 715 len. 34]: Three or four hours in the earlier portion of the day , and the same time in the latter , were dedicated to this pursuit , and my attention never tired or flagged .
Parsing [sent. 716 len. 28]: In the course of , I think , about six weeks , I could read , without hesitation , almost any portion of the Bible or Prayer-Book .
Parsing [sent. 717 len. 32]: I required no more teaching from Jackson , who now became an attentive hearer , as I read to him every morning and evening a portion of the Gospel or Liturgy .
Parsing [sent. 718 len. 40]: But I can not say that I understood many portions which I read , and the questions which I put to Jackson puzzled him not a little , and very often he acknowledged that he could not answer them .
Parsing [sent. 719 len. 71]: As I afterwards discovered this arose from his own imperfect knowledge of the nature of the Christian religion , which , according to his statement to me , might be considered to have been comprised in the following sentence : `` If you do good on earth , you will go to heaven and be happy ; if you do ill , you will go to hell and be tormented .
Parsing [sent. 720 len. 32]: Christ came down from heaven to teach us what to do , and how to follow his example ; and all that we read in the Bible we must believe . ''
Parsing [sent. 721 len. 14]: This may be considered as the creed imparted to me at that time .
Parsing [sent. 722 len. 26]: I believe that Jackson , like many others , knew no better , and candidly told me what he himself had been taught to believe .
Parsing [sent. 723 len. 20]: But the season for the return of the birds arrived , and our stock of provender was getting low .
Parsing [sent. 724 len. 18]: I was therefore soon obliged to leave my books , and work hard for Jackson and myself .
Parsing [sent. 725 len. 16]: As soon as the young birds were old enough , I set to my task .
Parsing [sent. 726 len. 30]: And now I found how valuable were the knives which I had obtained from the seaman 's chest ; indeed , in many points I could work much faster .
Parsing [sent. 727 len. 52]: By tying the neck and sleeves of a duck frock , I made a bag , which enabled me to carry the birds more conveniently , and in greater quantities at a time , and with the knives I could skin and prepare a bird in one quarter of the time .
Parsing [sent. 728 len. 44]: With my fishing-lines also , I could hang up more to dry at one time , so that , though without assistance , I had more birds cured in the same time than when Jackson and I were both employed in the labour .
Parsing [sent. 729 len. 37]: The whole affair , however , occupied me from morning to evening for more than three weeks , by which time the major portion of my provender was piled up at the back of the cabin .
Parsing [sent. 730 len. 46]: I did not , however , lose what I had gained in reading , as Jackson would not let me go away in the morning , or retire to my bed in the evening , without my reading to him a portion of the Bible .
Parsing [sent. 731 len. 14]: Indeed , he appeared to be uncomfortable if I did not do so .
Parsing [sent. 732 len. 37]: At last , the work was ended , and then I felt a strong desire return to hear that portion of Jackson 's history connected with my father and mother , and I told him so .
Parsing [sent. 733 len. 39]: He did not appear to be pleased with my communication , or at all willing to proceed , but as I pressed him hard and showed some symptoms of resolution and rebellion , he reluctantly resumed his narrative .
Parsing [sent. 734 len. 126]: Chapter VIII `` I wish you to understand , '' said he , `` that my unwillingness to go on with my history , proceeds from my being obliged to make known to you the hatred that subsisted between your father and me ; but if you will recollect , that we both had , in our early days , been striving to gain the same object -- I mean your mother -- and also that he had taken , as it were , what I considered to have been my place , in other points -- that he had been successful in life , and I had been unfortunate , you must not then be surprised at my hating him as I did . ''
Parsing [sent. 735 len. 29]: `` I understand nothing about your feelings , '' replied I ; `` and why he injured you by marrying my mother , I can not see . ''
Parsing [sent. 736 len. 7]: `` Why I loved her . ''
Parsing [sent. 737 len. 29]: `` Well , suppose you did , I do n't know what love is , and therefore can not understand it , so tell me the story . ''
Parsing [sent. 738 len. 48]: `` Well then , when I left off , I told you that we had ventured to land upon this island by running the boat into the bathing-pond , but in so doing , the boat was beaten to pieces , and was of no use afterwards .
Parsing [sent. 739 len. 30]: We landed , eight persons in all -- that is , the captain , your father , the carpenter , mate , and three seamen , besides your mother .
Parsing [sent. 740 len. 38]: We had literally nothing in the boat except three axes , two kids , and the two pannikins , which we have indeed now , but as for provisions or even water we had none of either .
Parsing [sent. 741 len. 34]: Our first object , therefore , was to search the island to obtain water , and this we soon found at the rill which now runs down by the side of the cabin .
Parsing [sent. 742 len. 54]: It was very fortunate for us that we arrived exactly at the time that the birds had come on the island , and had just laid their eggs ; if not , we must have perished with hunger , for we had not a fish-hook with us or even a fathom of line .
Parsing [sent. 743 len. 20]: `` We collected a quantity of eggs , and made a good meal , although we devoured them raw .
Parsing [sent. 744 len. 51]: While we were running about , or rather climbing about , over the rocks , to find out what chance of subsistence we might have on the island , the captain and your father remained with your mother , who sat down in a sheltered spot near to the bathing-pool .
Parsing [sent. 745 len. 84]: On our return in the evening , the captain called us all together that he might speak to us , and he said that if we would do well we must all act in concert ; that it also would be necessary that one should have the command and control of the others ; that without such was the case , nothing would go on well ; -- and he asked us if we did not consider that what he said was true .
Parsing [sent. 746 len. 30]: We all agreed , although I , for one , felt little inclination to do so , but as all the rest said so , I raised no objections .
Parsing [sent. 747 len. 96]: The captain then told us that as we were all of one opinion , the next point , was to decide as to who should have the command -- he said , that if it had been on ship-board , he of course would have taken it himself , but now we were on shore he thought that Mr Henniker was a much more competent person than he was , and he therefore proposed that the command should be given to him , and he , for one , would willingly be under his orders .
Parsing [sent. 748 len. 19]: To this proposal , the carpenter and mate immediately agreed , and at last two of the seamen .
Parsing [sent. 749 len. 41]: I was left alone , but I resisted , saying , that I was not going to be ordered about by a landsman , and that if I were to obey orders , it must be from a thorough-bred seaman .
Parsing [sent. 750 len. 40]: The other two sailors were of my way of thinking , I was sure , although they had given their consent , and I hoped that they would join me , which they appeared very much inclined to do .
Parsing [sent. 751 len. 11]: Your father spoke very coolly , modestly , and prudently .
Parsing [sent. 752 len. 42]: He pointed out that he had no wish to take the command , and that he would cheerfully serve under the captain of the vessel , if it would be more satisfactory to all parties that such should be the case .
Parsing [sent. 753 len. 52]: But the captain and the others were positive , saying that they would not have their choice disputed by such a drunken vagabond as I was , and that if I did not like to remain with them , I might go to any part of the island that I chose .
Parsing [sent. 754 len. 71]: This conference ended by my getting in a passion , and saying that I would not be under your father 's orders ; and I was seizing one of the axes to go off with it , when the captain caught my arm and wrested it from me , stating that the axe was his property , and then telling me that I was welcome to go where I pleased .
Parsing [sent. 755 len. 29]: `` I left them , therefore , and went away by myself to where the birds were hatching , as I wished to secure a supply of eggs .
Parsing [sent. 756 len. 32]: When the night closed in , I lay down upon the guano , and felt no cold , for the gale was now over , and the weather was very mild .
Parsing [sent. 757 len. 20]: `` The next morning , when I awoke , I found that the sun had been up some time .
Parsing [sent. 758 len. 23]: I looked for the rest of my companions whom I had quitted , and perceived that they were all busily at work .
Parsing [sent. 759 len. 30]: The sea was quite calm ; and , when the vessel went down after we left , many articles had floated , and had been washed to the island .
Parsing [sent. 760 len. 44]: Some of the men were busy collecting spars and planks , which were near the rocks , and pushing them along with the boat-hooks to the direction of the bathing pond , where they hauled them over the ridge , and secured them .
Parsing [sent. 761 len. 36]: Your father and mother , with the carpenter , were on this ledge where we now are , having selected it as a proper place for building a shelter , and were apparently very busy .
Parsing [sent. 762 len. 27]: The captain and one of the seamen were carrying up what spars and timber could be collected to where your father was standing with the carpenter .
Parsing [sent. 763 len. 76]: All appeared to be active , and working into each others hands ; and I confess that , as I looked on , I envied them , and wished that I had been along with them ; but I could not bear the idea of obeying any orders given by your father ; and this alone prevented my joining them , and making my excuses for what I had done and said the previous night .
Parsing [sent. 764 len. 24]: I therefore swallowed some more birds ' eggs raw , and sat down in the sun , looking at them as they worked .
Parsing [sent. 765 len. 11]: `` I soon perceived that the carpenter had commenced operations .
Parsing [sent. 766 len. 47]: The frame of this cabin was , with the assistance of your father , before it was noon , quite complete and put up ; and then they all went down to the bathing place , where the boat was lying with her bottom beaten out .
Parsing [sent. 767 len. 39]: They commenced taking her to pieces and saving all the nails ; the other men carried up the portions of the boat as they were ripped off , to where the frame of the cabin had been raised .
Parsing [sent. 768 len. 25]: I saw your mother go up with a load in her hand , which I believed to be the nails taken from the boat .
Parsing [sent. 769 len. 30]: In a couple of hours the boat was in pieces and carried up , and then your father and most of the men went up to assist the carpenter .
Parsing [sent. 770 len. 16]: I hardly need tell what they did , as you have the cabin before you .
Parsing [sent. 771 len. 36]: The roof , you see , is mostly built out of the timbers of the boat ; and the lower part out of heavier wood ; and a very good job they made of it .
Parsing [sent. 772 len. 51]: Before the morning closed in , one of the sides of the cabin was finished ; and I saw them light a fire with the chips that had been cut off with the axes , and they then dressed the eggs and birds which they had collected the first day .
Parsing [sent. 773 len. 50]: `` There was one thing which I had quite forgotten when I mutinied and left my companions , which was , the necessity of water to drink ; and I now perceived that they had taken possession of the spot where the only water had as yet been found .
Parsing [sent. 774 len. 34]: I was suffering very much from thirst towards the close of the day , and I set off up the ravine to ascertain if there was none to be found in that direction .
Parsing [sent. 775 len. 28]: Before night I succeeded in finding some , as you know , for you have often drunk from the spring when you have gone up for firewood .
Parsing [sent. 776 len. 22]: This gave me great encouragement , for I was afraid that the want of water would have driven me to submission .
Parsing [sent. 777 len. 105]: By way of bravado , I tore off , and cut with my knife , as many boughs of the underwood on the ravine as I well could carry , and the next morning I built a sort of wigwam for myself on the guano , to show them that I had a house over my head as well as they had ; but I built it farther up to the edge of the cliff , above the guano plain , so that I need not have any communication with those who I knew would come for eggs and birds for their daily sustenance .
Parsing [sent. 778 len. 17]: `` Before the night of the following day set in , the cabin was quite finished .
Parsing [sent. 779 len. 88]: `` The weather became warmer every day , and I found it very fatiguing to have to climb the ravine two or three times a day to procure a drink of water , for I had nothing to hold water in , and I thought that it would be better that I should take up my quarters in the ravine , and build myself a wigwam among the brushwood close to the water , instead of having to make so many journeys for so necessary an article .
Parsing [sent. 780 len. 52]: I knew that I could carry eggs in my hat and pocket-handkerchief sufficient for two or three days at one trip ; so I determined that I would do so ; and the next morning I went up the ravine , loaded with eggs , to take up my residence there .
Parsing [sent. 781 len. 19]: In a day or two I had built my hut of boughs , and made it very comfortable .
Parsing [sent. 782 len. 36]: I returned for a fresh supply of eggs on the third day , with a basket I had constructed out of young boughs , and which enabled me to carry a whole week 's sustenance .
Parsing [sent. 783 len. 50]: Then I felt quite satisfied , and made up my mind that I would live as a hermit during my sojourn on the island , however long it might be ; for I preferred anything to obeying the orders of one whom I detested as I did your father .
Parsing [sent. 784 len. 21]: `` It soon was evident , however , how well they had done in selecting your father as their leader .
Parsing [sent. 785 len. 25]: They had fancied that the birds would remain on the island , and that thus they would always be able to procure a supply .
Parsing [sent. 786 len. 27]: Your father , who had lived so long in Chili , knew better , and that in a few weeks they would quit their nesting place .
Parsing [sent. 787 len. 38]: He pointed this out to them , showing them what a mercy it was that they had been cast away just at this time , and how necessary it was to make a provision for the year .
Parsing [sent. 788 len. 45]: But this they could not imagine that it was possible to do without salt to cure the birds with ; but he knew how beef was preserved without salt on the continent , and showed them how to dry the birds in the sun .
Parsing [sent. 789 len. 36]: While therefore I was up in the ravine , they were busy collecting and drying them in large quantities , and before the time of the birds leaving they had laid up a sufficient supply .
Parsing [sent. 790 len. 28]: It was he also that invented the fishing lines out of the sinews of the legs of the birds , and your mother who knotted them together .
Parsing [sent. 791 len. 49]: At first , they caught fish with some hooks made of nails , but your father showed them the way to take them without a hook , as you have learnt from me , and which he had been shown by some of the Indians on the continent .
Parsing [sent. 792 len. 24]: Owing to your father , they were well prepared when the birds flew away with their young ones , while I was destitute .
Parsing [sent. 793 len. 63]: Previous to the flight , I had fared but badly , for the eggs contained the young birds half formed , and latterly so completely formed that I could not eat them , and as I had no fire and did not understand drying them , I had no alternative but eating the young birds raw , which was anything but pleasant .
Parsing [sent. 794 len. 57]: I consoled myself , however , with the idea that your father and mother and the rest were faring just as badly as myself , and I looked forward to the time when the birds would begin to lay eggs again , when I resolved to hoard up a much larger supply while they were fresh .
Parsing [sent. 795 len. 48]: But my schemes were all put an end to , for in two days , after a great deal of noise and flying about in circles , all the birds , young and old , took wing , and left me without any means of future subsistence .
Parsing [sent. 796 len. 17]: `` This was a horrid discovery , and I was put to my wits ' ends .
Parsing [sent. 797 len. 33]: I wandered over the guano place , and , after the third day of their departure , was glad to pick up even a dead bird with which to appease my hunger .
Parsing [sent. 798 len. 28]: At the same time , I wondered how my former companions got on , for I considered that they must be as badly off as I was .
Parsing [sent. 799 len. 17]: I watched them from behind the rocks , but I could perceive no signs of uneasiness .
Parsing [sent. 800 len. 23]: There was your mother sitting quietly on the level by the cabin , and your father or the captain talking with her .
Parsing [sent. 801 len. 42]: I perceived , however , that two of the party were employed fishing off the rocks , and I wondered where they got their fishing-lines , and at last I concluded that it was by catching fish that they supported themselves .
Parsing [sent. 802 len. 24]: This , however , did not help me -- I was starving , and starvation will bring down the pride of any man .
Parsing [sent. 803 len. 43]: On the fifth day , I walked down to the rocks , to where one of the seamen was fishing , and having greeted him , I told him that I was starving , and asked for something to eat . '' '
Parsing [sent. 804 len. 28]: I can not help you , ' replied he ; ' I have no power to give anything away ; it is more than I dare do .
Parsing [sent. 805 len. 13]: You must apply to Mr Henniker , who is the governor now .
Parsing [sent. 806 len. 23]: What a foolish fellow you were to mutiny , as you did ; see what it has brought you to . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 807 len. 27]: ` Why , ' replied I , ` if it were not for fishing , you would not be better off than I am . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 808 len. 28]: ` Oh yes we should be ; but we have to thank him for that -- without him , I grant , we should not have been .
Parsing [sent. 809 len. 15]: We have plenty of provisions , although we fish to help them out . '
Parsing [sent. 810 len. 14]: `` This puzzled me amazingly , but there was no help for it .
Parsing [sent. 811 len. 44]: I could starve no longer , so up I went to the level where your father was standing with the captain , and in a swaggering sort of tone , said that I had come back , and wanted to join my comrades .
Parsing [sent. 812 len. 44]: The captain looked at me , and referred me to your father , who said that he would consult with the rest when they came to dinner , as without their permission he could do nothing , and then they both turned away .
Parsing [sent. 813 len. 75]: In the meantime I was ravenous with hunger , and was made more so by perceiving that two large fish were slowly baking on the embers of the fire , and that your mother was watching them ; however , there was no help for it , and I sat down at some little distance , anxiously waiting for the return of the rest of the party , when my fate would be decided .
Parsing [sent. 814 len. 22]: My pride was now brought down so low that I could have submitted to any terms which might have been dictated .
Parsing [sent. 815 len. 101]: In about two hours they were all assembled to dinner , and I remained envying every morsel that they ate , until the repast was finished ; when after some consultation , I was ordered to approach -- which I did -- and your father addressed me : ` Jackson , you deserted us when you might have been very useful , and when our labour was severe ; now that we have worked hard , and made ourselves tolerably comfortable , you request to join us , and partake with us of the fruits of our labour and foresight .
Parsing [sent. 816 len. 23]: You have provided nothing , we have -- the consequence is that we are in comparative plenty , while you are starving .
Parsing [sent. 817 len. 51]: Now I have taken the opinion of my companions , and they are all agreed , that as you have not assisted when you are wanted , should we now allow you to join us , you will have to work more than the others to make up an equivalent .
Parsing [sent. 818 len. 50]: It is therefore proposed that you shall join us on one condition , which is , that during the year till the birds again visit the island , it will be your task to go up to the ravine every day , and procure the firewood which is required .
Parsing [sent. 819 len. 43]: If you choose to accept these terms , you are permitted to join , always supposing that to all the other rules and regulations which we have laid down for our guidance , you will be subject as well as we are .
Parsing [sent. 820 len. 15]: These are our terms , and you may decide as you think proper . '
Parsing [sent. 821 len. 43]: I hardly need say , that I gladly accepted them , and was still more glad when the remnants of the dinner were placed before me ; I was nearly choked , I devoured with such haste until my appetite was appeased .
Parsing [sent. 822 len. 47]: `` When this was done , I thought over the conditions which I had accepted , and my blood boiled at the idea that I was to be in a manner the slave to the rest , as I should have to work hard every day .
Parsing [sent. 823 len. 30]: I forgot that it was but justice , and that I was only earning my share of the years ' provisions , which I had not assisted to collect .
Parsing [sent. 824 len. 29]: My heart was still more bitter against your father , and I vowed vengeance if ever I had an opportunity , but there was no help for it .
Parsing [sent. 825 len. 29]: Every day I went up with a piece of cord and an axe , cut a large faggot of wood , and brought it down to the cabin .
Parsing [sent. 826 len. 29]: It was hard work , and occupied me from breakfast to dinner-time , and I had no time to lose if I wanted to be back for dinner .
Parsing [sent. 827 len. 24]: The captain always examined the faggot , and ascertained that I had brought down a sufficient supply for the day 's consumption . ''
Parsing [sent. 828 len. 15]: Chapter IX `` A year passed away , during which I was thus employed .
Parsing [sent. 829 len. 36]: At last , the birds made their appearance , and after we had laid up our annual provision , I was freed from my task , and had only to share the labour with others .
Parsing [sent. 830 len. 57]: It was now a great source of speculation how long we were likely to remain on the island ; every day did we anxiously look out for a vessel , but we could see none , or if seen , they were too far off from the island to permit us to make signals to them .
Parsing [sent. 831 len. 28]: At last we began to give up all hope , and , as hope was abandoned , a settled gloom was perceptible on most of our faces .
Parsing [sent. 832 len. 22]: I believe that others would have now mutinied as well as myself , if they had known what to mutiny about .
Parsing [sent. 833 len. 137]: Your father and mother were the life and soul of the party , inventing amusements , or narrating a touching story in the evenings , so as to beguile the weary time ; great respect was paid to your mother , which she certainly deserved ; I seldom approached her ; she had taken a decided dislike to me , arising , I presume , from my behaviour towards her husband , for now that I was again on a footing with the others , I was as insolent to him as I dared to be , without incurring the penalty attached to insubordination , and I opposed him as much as I could in every proposal that he brought forward -- but your father kept his temper , although I lost mine but too often .
Parsing [sent. 834 len. 65]: The first incident which occurred of any consequence , was the loss of two of the men , who had , with your father 's permission , taken a week 's provisions , with the intention of making a tour round the island , and ascertaining whether any valuable information could be brought back ; they were the carpenter and one of the seamen .
Parsing [sent. 835 len. 41]: It appears that during their return , as they were crossing the highest ridge , they , feeling very thirsty , and not finding water , attempted to refresh themselves by eating some berries which they found on a plant .
Parsing [sent. 836 len. 24]: These berries proved to be strong poison , and they returned very ill -- after languishing a few days , they both died .
Parsing [sent. 837 len. 72]: `` This was an event which roused us up , and broke the monotony of our life ; but it was one which was not very agreeable to dwell upon , and yet , at the same time , I felt rather pleasure than annoyance at it -- I felt that I was of more consequence , and many other thoughts entered my mind which I shall not now dwell upon .
Parsing [sent. 838 len. 24]: We buried them in the guano , under the first high rock , where , indeed , the others were all subsequently buried .
Parsing [sent. 839 len. 13]: Three more months passed away , when the other seaman was missing .
Parsing [sent. 840 len. 15]: After a search , his trousers were found at the edge of the rock .
Parsing [sent. 841 len. 26]: He had evidently been bathing in the sea , for the day on which he was missed , the water was as smooth as glass .
Parsing [sent. 842 len. 57]: Whether he had seen something floating , which he wished to bring to land , or whether he had ventured for his own amusement , for he was an excellent swimmer , could never be ascertained -- any more than whether he had sunk with the cramp , or had been taken down by a shark .
Parsing [sent. 843 len. 22]: He never appeared again , and his real fate is a mystery to this day , and must ever remain so .
Parsing [sent. 844 len. 20]: Thus were we reduced to four men -- your father , the captain , the mate , and me .
Parsing [sent. 845 len. 21]: But you must be tired -- I will stop now , and tell you the remainder some other time . ''
Parsing [sent. 846 len. 30]: Although I was not tired , yet , as Jackson appeared to be so , I made no objection to his proposal , and we both went to sleep .
Parsing [sent. 847 len. 49]: While I had read the Bible to Jackson , I had often been puzzled by numbers being mentioned , and never could understand what was meant , that is , I could form no of the quantity represented by seventy or sixty , or whatever it might be .
Parsing [sent. 848 len. 8]: Jackson 's answer was , `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 849 len. 39]: it means a great many ; I 'll explain to you bye-and-bye , but we have nothing to count with , and as I am blind , I must have something in my hand to teach you . ''
Parsing [sent. 850 len. 41]: I recollected that at the bathing pool there were a great many small shells on the rocks , about the size of a pea ; there were live fish in them , and they appeared to crawl on the rocks .
Parsing [sent. 851 len. 25]: I collected a great quantity of these , and brought them up to the cabin , and requested Jackson would teach me to count .
Parsing [sent. 852 len. 17]: This he did , until he came to a thousand , which he said was sufficient .
Parsing [sent. 853 len. 51]: For many days I continued to count up to a hundred , until I was quite perfect , and then Jackson taught me addition and subtraction to a certain degree , by making me add and take away from the shells , and count the accumulation , or the remainder .
Parsing [sent. 854 len. 52]: At last , I could remember what I had gained by manipulation , if I may use the term , but further , I could not go , although addition had , to a degree , made me master of multiplication , and subtraction gave me a good idea of division .
Parsing [sent. 855 len. 17]: This was a new delight to me , and occupied me for three or four weeks .
Parsing [sent. 856 len. 34]: At last I had , as I thought , learned all that he could teach me in his blind state , and I threw away the shells , and sighed for something more .
Parsing [sent. 857 len. 55]: Of a sudden it occurred to me , that I had never looked into the book which still lay upon the shelf in the cabin , and I saw no reason now that I should not ; so I mentioned it to Jackson , and asked him why I might not have that book ?
Parsing [sent. 858 len. 26]: `` To be sure you may , '' replied he ; `` but you never asked for it , and I quite forgot it . ''
Parsing [sent. 859 len. 19]: `` But when I asked you before , you were so particular that I should not open it .
Parsing [sent. 860 len. 7]: What was your reason then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 861 len. 28]: Jackson replied -- `` I had no reason except that I then disliked you , and I thought that looking into the book would give you pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 862 len. 43]: It belonged to that poor fellow that was drowned ; he had left it in the stern-sheets of the boat when we were at Valdivia , and had forgotten it , and we found it there when we landed on the island .
Parsing [sent. 863 len. 10]: Take it down , it will amuse you . ''
Parsing [sent. 864 len. 10]: I took down the book , and opened it .
Parsing [sent. 865 len. 16]: It was , if I recollect right , called `` Mavor 's Natural History . ''
Parsing [sent. 866 len. 25]: At all events , it was a Natural History of Beasts and Birds , with a plate representing each , and a description annexed .
Parsing [sent. 867 len. 16]: It would be impossible for me to convey to the reader my astonishment and delight .
Parsing [sent. 868 len. 12]: I had never seen a picture or drawing in my life .
Parsing [sent. 869 len. 9]: I did not know that such things existed .
Parsing [sent. 870 len. 29]: I was in an ecstasy of delight as I turned over the pages , hardly taking sufficient time to see one object before I hastened on to another .
Parsing [sent. 871 len. 34]: For two or three hours did I thus turn over leaves , without settling upon any one animal ; at last my pulse beat more regularly , and I commenced with the Lion .
Parsing [sent. 872 len. 22]: But now what a source of amusement , and what a multitude of questions had to be answered by my companion .
Parsing [sent. 873 len. 57]: He had to tell me all about the countries in which the animals were found ; and the description of the animals , with the anecdotes , were a source of much conversation ; and , what was more , the foregrounds and backgrounds of the landscapes with which the animals were surrounded produced new ideas .
Parsing [sent. 874 len. 16]: There was a palm-tree , which I explained to Jackson , and inquired about it .
Parsing [sent. 875 len. 6]: This led to more inquiries .
Parsing [sent. 876 len. 30]: The lion himself occupied him and me for a whole afternoon , and it was getting dark when I lay down , with my new treasure by my side .
Parsing [sent. 877 len. 57]: I had read of the lion in the Scriptures , and now I recalled all the passages ; and before I slept I thought of the bear which destroyed the children who had mocked Elisha the prophet , and I determined that the first animal I would read about the next morning should be the bear .
Parsing [sent. 878 len. 33]: I think that this book lasted me nearly two months , during which time , except reading a portion every night and morning to Jackson , the Bible and Prayer-book were neglected .
Parsing [sent. 879 len. 41]: Sometimes I thought that the book could not be true ; but when I came to the birds , I found those which frequented the island so correctly described , that I had no longer any doubt on the subject .
Parsing [sent. 880 len. 65]: Perhaps what interested me most were the plates in which the barn-door fowls and the peacock were described , as in the background of the first were a cottage and figures , representing the rural scenery of England , my own country ; and in the second there was a splendid mansion , and a carriage and four horses driving up to the door .
Parsing [sent. 881 len. 31]: In short , it is impossible to convey to the reader the new ideas which I received from these slight efforts of the draftsman to give effect to his drawing .
Parsing [sent. 882 len. 20]: The engraving was also a matter of much wonder , and required a great deal of explanation from Jackson .
Parsing [sent. 883 len. 37]: This book became my treasure , and it was not till I had read it through and through , so as almost to know it by heart , that at length I returned to my Bible .
Parsing [sent. 884 len. 28]: All this time I had never asked Jackson to go on with his narrative ; but now that my curiosity was appeased , I made the request .
Parsing [sent. 885 len. 21]: He appeared , as before , very unwilling ; but I was pertinacious , and he was worried into it .
Parsing [sent. 886 len. 63]: `` There were but four of us left and your mother , and the mate was in a very bad state of health ; he fretted very much , poor fellow , for he had left a young wife in England , and what he appeared to fear most was , that she would be married again before he could get home .
Parsing [sent. 887 len. 27]: It ended in a confirmed liver complaint , which carried him off nine months afterwards ; and thus was one more of our companions disposed of .
Parsing [sent. 888 len. 27]: He died very quietly , and gave me his sleeve-buttons and watch to deliver to his wife , if ever I should escape from the island .
Parsing [sent. 889 len. 13]: I fear there is little chance of her ever receiving them . ''
Parsing [sent. 890 len. 6]: `` Where are they ? ''
Parsing [sent. 891 len. 17]: said I , recollecting how I had seen him lift up the board under his bed-place .
Parsing [sent. 892 len. 24]: `` I have them safe , '' replied Jackson , `` and if necessary , will tell you where to find them . ''
Parsing [sent. 893 len. 12]: This reply satisfied me , and I allowed him to proceed .
Parsing [sent. 894 len. 23]: `` We buried him in the guano , by the side of the two others , and now we were but three .
Parsing [sent. 895 len. 27]: It was at this time that your mother was confined and you were born ; that is about three months after the death of the mate .
Parsing [sent. 896 len. 38]: We had just finished laying in our stock of birds for the year when she was taken ill , sooner than was expected , and it was supposed that it was occasioned by over-exertion at the time .
Parsing [sent. 897 len. 37]: However , she got up very well without any medical assistance , and your father was much pleased at having a son , for he had been married five years without any prospect of a family .
Parsing [sent. 898 len. 72]: I ought to observe that the loss of our companions , one after another , had had the effect of bringing those that remained much closer together ; I was treated with more kindness by both your father and mother , and the captain , and I returned it as well as my feelings would permit me , for I could not altogether get rid of my animosity to your father .
Parsing [sent. 899 len. 21]: However , we became much more confidential , that is certain , and I was now treated as an equal .
Parsing [sent. 900 len. 35]: `` Six months passed away and you had become a thriving child , when a melancholy occurrence '' -- here Jackson covered up his face with his hands and remained for some time silent .
Parsing [sent. 901 len. 22]: `` Go on , '' said I , `` Jackson , I know that they all died somehow or another . ''
Parsing [sent. 902 len. 11]: `` Very true , '' replied he , recovering himself .
Parsing [sent. 903 len. 7]: `` Well , your father disappeared .
Parsing [sent. 904 len. 28]: He had gone to the rocks to fish , and when I was sent to bring him home to dinner , he was nowhere to be found .
Parsing [sent. 905 len. 35]: It was supposed that a larger fish than usual had been fast to his line , and that he had been jerked off the rocks into the water and the sharks had taken him .
Parsing [sent. 906 len. 15]: It was a dreadful affair , '' continued Jackson , again covering his face .
Parsing [sent. 907 len. 34]: `` I think , '' replied I , `` that any man in his senses would have allowed the fish to have taken the line rather than have been dragged into the water .
Parsing [sent. 908 len. 17]: I do n't think that the supposed manner of his death is at all satisfactory . ''
Parsing [sent. 909 len. 18]: `` Perhaps not , '' replied Jackson ; `` his foot may have slipped , who knows ?
Parsing [sent. 910 len. 22]: we only could guess ; the line was gone as well as he , which made us think what I said .
Parsing [sent. 911 len. 49]: Still we searched everywhere , but without hope ; and our search -- that is the captain 's and mine , for your poor mother remained with you in her arms distracted -- was the cause of another disaster -- no less than the death of the captain .
Parsing [sent. 912 len. 21]: They say misfortunes never come single , and surely this was an instance of the truth of the proverb . ''
Parsing [sent. 913 len. 7]: `` How did he die ? ''
Parsing [sent. 914 len. 22]: replied I , gravely , for somehow or other I felt doubts as to the truth of what he was saying .
Parsing [sent. 915 len. 33]: Jackson did not reply till after a pause , when he said -- `` He was out with me up the ravine collecting firewood , and he fell over the high cliff .
Parsing [sent. 916 len. 13]: He was so injured that he died in half an hour . ''
Parsing [sent. 917 len. 7]: `` What did you do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 918 len. 44]: `` What did I do -- what could I do but go back and break the news to your mother , who was distracted when she heard it ; for the captain was her friend , and she could not bear me . ''
Parsing [sent. 919 len. 40]: `` Well go on , pray , '' said I. `` I did all that I could to make your mother comfortable , as there now were but her , you , and I , left on the island .
Parsing [sent. 920 len. 25]: You were then about three years old ; but your mother always hated me , and appeared now to hate me more and more .
Parsing [sent. 921 len. 35]: She never recovered the loss of your father to whom she was devotedly attached ; she pined away , and after six months she died , leaving you and me only on the island .
Parsing [sent. 922 len. 19]: Now you know the whole history , and pray do not ask me any more about it . ''
Parsing [sent. 923 len. 13]: Chapter X Jackson threw himself back in his bed-place and was silent .
Parsing [sent. 924 len. 27]: So was I , for I was recalling all that he had told me , and my doubts were raised as to the truth of it .
Parsing [sent. 925 len. 21]: I did not like his hurrying over the latter portion of his narrative in the way which he had done .
Parsing [sent. 926 len. 11]: What he had said about my mother was not satisfactory .
Parsing [sent. 927 len. 46]: I had for some time been gradually drawing towards him , not only shewing , but feeling , for him a great increase of goodwill ; but suspicion had entered my mind , and I now began to feel my former animosity towards him renewed .
Parsing [sent. 928 len. 65]: A night 's sleep , however , and more reflection , induced me to think that possibly I was judging him too harshly , and as I could not afford to quarrel with him , our intercourse remained as amicable as before , particularly as he became more and more amiable towards me and did everything in his power to interest and amuse me .
Parsing [sent. 929 len. 112]: I was one day reading to him the account of a monkey given in the book of Natural History , in which it is said that that animal is fond of spirits and will intoxicate itself , and Jackson was telling me many anecdotes of monkeys on board of the vessel he had sailed in , when it occurred to me that I had never thought of mentioning to him or of ascertaining the contents of the cask which had been thrown into the bathing-pool with the seaman 's chest , and I did so then to Jackson , wondering at its contents and how they were to be got at .
Parsing [sent. 930 len. 32]: Jackson entered into the question warmly , explaining to me how and where to bore holes with a gimlet , and making two spiles for me to stop the holes with .
Parsing [sent. 931 len. 32]: As soon as he had done so , curiosity induced me to go down to the pool where the cask had been lying so long , in about a foot-and-half water .
Parsing [sent. 932 len. 34]: By Jackson 's directions I took a pannikin with me , that I might bring him a specimen of the contents of the cask , if they should prove not to be water .
Parsing [sent. 933 len. 64]: I soon bored the hole above and below , following Jackson 's directions , and the liquor , which poured out in a small stream into the pannikin , was of a brown colour and very strong in odour , so strong , indeed , as to make me reel as I walked back to the rocks with the pannikin full of it .
Parsing [sent. 934 len. 12]: I then sat down , and after a time tasted it .
Parsing [sent. 935 len. 17]: I thought I had swallowed fire , for I had taken a good mouthful of it .
Parsing [sent. 936 len. 26]: `` This can not be what Jackson called spirits , '' said I. `` No one can drink this -- what can it be ? ''
Parsing [sent. 937 len. 57]: Although I had not swallowed more than a table-spoonful of it , yet , combined with the fumes of the liquor which I had inhaled when drawing it off into the pannikin , the effect was to make my head swim , and I lay down on the rock and shut my eyes to recover myself .
Parsing [sent. 938 len. 41]: It ended in my falling asleep for many hours , for it was not much after noon when I went to the cask , and it was near sunset when I awoke , with an intense pain in my head .
Parsing [sent. 939 len. 66]: It was some time before I could recollect where I was , or what had passed , but the pannikin full of liquor by my side first reminded me ; and then perceiving how late it was , and how long I must have slept , I rose up , and taking the pannikin in my hand , I hastened to return to the cabin .
Parsing [sent. 940 len. 27]: As I approached , I heard the voice of Jackson , whose hearing , since his blindness , I had observed , had become peculiarly acute .
Parsing [sent. 941 len. 8]: `` Is that you , Frank ? ''
Parsing [sent. 942 len. 21]: `` Yes , '' replied I. `` And what has kept you so long -- how you have frightened me .
Parsing [sent. 943 len. 19]: God forgive me , but I thought that I was to be left and abandoned to starvation . ''
Parsing [sent. 944 len. 9]: `` Why should you have thought that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 945 len. 27]: replied I. `` Because I thought that some way or another you must have been killed , and then I must have died , of course .
Parsing [sent. 946 len. 22]: I never was so frightened in my life , the idea of dying here all alone -- it was terrible . ''
Parsing [sent. 947 len. 61]: It occurred to me at the time that the alarm was all for himself , for he did not say a word about how sorry he should have been at any accident happening to me , but I made no remark , simply stating what had occurred , and my conviction that the contents of the cask were not drinkable .
Parsing [sent. 948 len. 9]: `` Have you brought any with you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 949 len. 5]: inquired he , sharply .
Parsing [sent. 950 len. 16]: `` Yes , here it is , '' said I , giving him the pannikin .
Parsing [sent. 951 len. 24]: He smelt it , and raised it to his lips -- took about a wine-glassful of it , and then drew his breath .
Parsing [sent. 952 len. 22]: `` This is delightful , '' said he ; `` the best of old rum , I never tasted so good .
Parsing [sent. 953 len. 11]: How big did you say that the cask was ? ''
Parsing [sent. 954 len. 9]: I described it as well as I could .
Parsing [sent. 955 len. 19]: `` Indeed , then it must be a whole puncheon -- that will last a long while . ''
Parsing [sent. 956 len. 17]: `` But do you mean to say that you really like to drink that stuff ? ''
Parsing [sent. 957 len. 10]: inquired I. `` Do I like to drink it ?
Parsing [sent. 958 len. 16]: yes , it is good for men , but it 's death to little boys .
Parsing [sent. 959 len. 5]: It will kill you .
Parsing [sent. 960 len. 8]: Do n't you get fond of it .
Parsing [sent. 961 len. 13]: Now promise me that you will never drink a drop of it .
Parsing [sent. 962 len. 18]: You must not get fond of it , or some sad accident will happen to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 963 len. 34]: `` I do n't think you need fear my drinking it , '' replied I. `` I have had one taste , as I told you , and it nearly burnt my mouth .
Parsing [sent. 964 len. 8]: I sha n't touch it again . ''
Parsing [sent. 965 len. 16]: `` That 's right , '' replied Jackson , taking another quantity into his mouth .
Parsing [sent. 966 len. 32]: `` You are not old enough for it ; bye-and-bye , when you are as old as I am , you may drink it , then it will do you good .
Parsing [sent. 967 len. 14]: Now , I 'll go to bed , it 's time for bed .
Parsing [sent. 968 len. 12]: Bring the pannikin after me and put it by my side .
Parsing [sent. 969 len. 11]: Take care you do n't spill any of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 970 len. 50]: Jackson crawled to his bed , and I followed him with the pannikin , and put it by his side , as he requested , and I returned to my own resting-place , without however having the least inclination to sleep , having slept so long during the day .
Parsing [sent. 971 len. 29]: At first Jackson was quiet , but I heard him occasionally applying to the pannikin , which held , I should say , about three half-pints of liquor .
Parsing [sent. 972 len. 57]: At last he commenced singing a sea song ; I was much surprised , as I had never heard him sing before ; but I was also much pleased , as it was the first time that I had ever heard anything like melody , for he had a good voice and sang in good tune .
Parsing [sent. 973 len. 14]: As soon as he had finished , I begged him to go on .
Parsing [sent. 974 len. 4]: `` Ah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 975 len. 15]: replied he , with a gay tone I had never heard from him before .
Parsing [sent. 976 len. 8]: `` You like songs , do you ?
Parsing [sent. 977 len. 4]: my little chap .
Parsing [sent. 978 len. 10]: Well , I 'll give you plenty of them .
Parsing [sent. 979 len. 22]: 'T is a long while since I have sung , but it 's a ` poor heart that never rejoiceth . '
Parsing [sent. 980 len. 32]: The time was when no one in company could sing a song as I could , and so I can again , now that I have something to cheer my heart .
Parsing [sent. 981 len. 8]: Yes , here 's another for you .
Parsing [sent. 982 len. 32]: I shall rouse them all out by-and-bye , as I get the grog in -- no fear of that -- you find the stuff , and I 'll find songs . ''
Parsing [sent. 983 len. 49]: I was surprised at first at this unusual mirth ; but recollecting what Jackson had told me about his intemperance , I presumed that this mirth which it produced was the cause why he indulged so much in it ; and I felt less inclined to blame him .
Parsing [sent. 984 len. 50]: At all events , I was much pleased with the songs that he sang to me one after another for three or four hours , when his voice became thick , and , after some muttering and swearing , he was quite silent , and soon afterwards snored loudly .
Parsing [sent. 985 len. 15]: I remained awake some time longer , and then I also sank into forgetfulness .
Parsing [sent. 986 len. 14]: When I awoke the next morning , I found Jackson still fast asleep .
Parsing [sent. 987 len. 51]: I waited for him for our morning meal ; but , as he did not wake , I took mine by myself , and then I walked out to the rock , where I usually sat , and looked round the horizon to see if there was anything in sight .
Parsing [sent. 988 len. 32]: The spy-glass , from having been in sea water , was of no use , and I did not know what to do with it ; nor could Jackson instruct me .
Parsing [sent. 989 len. 25]: After I had been out about an hour I returned , and found Jackson still snoring , and I determined to wake him up .
Parsing [sent. 990 len. 27]: I pushed him for some time without success ; but , at last he opened his eyes , and said : `` My watch already ? ''
Parsing [sent. 991 len. 23]: `` No , '' said I ; `` but you have slept so long , that I have waked you up . ''
Parsing [sent. 992 len. 29]: He paused , as if he did not know my voice , and then said : `` But I ca n't see anything ; how 's this ? ''
Parsing [sent. 993 len. 15]: `` Why , do n't you know that you 're blind , Jackson ? ''
Parsing [sent. 994 len. 6]: replied I , with amazement .
Parsing [sent. 995 len. 9]: `` Yes , yes ; I recollect now .
Parsing [sent. 996 len. 8]: Is there anything in the pannikin ? ''
Parsing [sent. 997 len. 20]: `` Not a drop , '' replied I ; `` why , you must have drunk it all . ''
Parsing [sent. 998 len. 7]: `` Yes , I recollect now .
Parsing [sent. 999 len. 17]: Get me some water , my good boy ; for I am dying with thirst . ''
Parsing [sent. 1000 len. 17]: I went for the water ; he drank the whole pannikin , and asked for more .
Parsing [sent. 1001 len. 10]: `` Wo n't you have something to eat ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1002 len. 5]: said I. `` Eat ?
Parsing [sent. 1003 len. 9]: oh no ; I ca n't eat anything .
Parsing [sent. 1004 len. 15]: Give me drink ; '' and he held out his hand for the pannikin .
Parsing [sent. 1005 len. 15]: I perceived how it trembled and shook , and I observed it to him .
Parsing [sent. 1006 len. 33]: `` Yes , '' replied he , `` that 's always the case after a carouse , and I had a good one last night -- the first for many a year .
Parsing [sent. 1007 len. 8]: But there 's plenty more of it .
Parsing [sent. 1008 len. 36]: I wish you would get me a little more now , Frank , just to steady me ; just about two or three mouthfuls , no more ; that is , no more till night-time .
Parsing [sent. 1009 len. 9]: Did I make much noise last night ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1010 len. 19]: `` You sang several songs , '' replied I , `` with which I was much amused . ''
Parsing [sent. 1011 len. 9]: `` I 'm glad that you liked them .
Parsing [sent. 1012 len. 37]: I used to be considered a good singer in my day ; indeed , if I had not been such good company , as they term it , I had not become so fond of drinking .
Parsing [sent. 1013 len. 26]: Just go and fetch me about half an inch high of the pannikin , my good fellow , that 's all I want now . ''
Parsing [sent. 1014 len. 21]: I went down to the cask , drew of the quantity that he requested , and brought it to him .
Parsing [sent. 1015 len. 19]: He drank it off ; and , in a few moments , appeared to be quite himself again .
Parsing [sent. 1016 len. 36]: He then asked for something to eat , and commenced telling me a variety of stories relative to what he termed jolly parties in his former days ; so that the day passed very agreeably .
Parsing [sent. 1017 len. 43]: As the night closed in , he said : `` Now , Frank , I know you want to hear some more songs ; so go down and bring me up a full pannikin , and I will sing you plenty . ''
Parsing [sent. 1018 len. 21]: I complied with his request , for I was anxious to be again amused as I was the night before .
Parsing [sent. 1019 len. 23]: The consequence was that this night was , in the early portion of it , but a repetition of the previous one .
Parsing [sent. 1020 len. 36]: Jackson took the precaution to get into his bed-place before he commenced drinking ; and , as soon as he had taken his second dose , he asked me what sort of songs I liked .
Parsing [sent. 1021 len. 22]: My reply naturally was , that I had never heard any one sing but him , and therefore could not say .
Parsing [sent. 1022 len. 11]: `` What did I sing to you last night ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1023 len. 3]: said he .
Parsing [sent. 1024 len. 8]: I replied as well as I could .
Parsing [sent. 1025 len. 24]: `` Ah , '' said he , `` they were all sea songs ; but now I will give you something better . ''
Parsing [sent. 1026 len. 33]: After a little thought , he commenced singing a very beautiful and plaintive one , and certainly much better than he had sung the night before ; for he now was sober .
Parsing [sent. 1027 len. 52]: The consequence was , that I was still more delighted ; and , at my request , he sang several others ; but at last his speech became rapid and thick , and he would not sing any more , using some very coarse expressions to me when I asked him .
Parsing [sent. 1028 len. 46]: For a time he was silent , and I thought that he was going to sleep , and I was reflecting upon the various effects which the liquor appeared to have upon him , when I heard him talking and muttering , and I listened .
Parsing [sent. 1029 len. 23]: `` Never mind how I got them , '' said he ; `` quite as honestly as other people , Old Moshes .
Parsing [sent. 1030 len. 12]: There they are , do you choose to buy them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1031 len. 25]: Then there was a pause , after which he commenced : `` They 're as pure diamonds as ever came out of a mine .
Parsing [sent. 1032 len. 14]: I know that , so none of your lies , you old Jew .
Parsing [sent. 1033 len. 7]: Where did I come by them ?
Parsing [sent. 1034 len. 7]: that 's no concern of yours .
Parsing [sent. 1035 len. 16]: The question is , will you give me the price , or will you not ?
Parsing [sent. 1036 len. 8]: Well , then , I 'm off .
Parsing [sent. 1037 len. 13]: No , I wo n't come back , you old thief . ''
Parsing [sent. 1038 len. 10]: Here he swore terribly , and then was silent .
Parsing [sent. 1039 len. 19]: After a while he recommenced -- `` Who can ever prove that they were Henniker 's diamonds ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1040 len. 32]: I started up at the mention of my father 's name ; I rested with my hands on the floor of the cabin , breathless as to what would come next .
Parsing [sent. 1041 len. 54]: `` No , no , '' continued Jackson , `` he 's dead , and food for fishes -- dead men tell no tales -- and she 's dead , and the captain 's dead , all dead -- yes , all ; '' and he gave a bitter groan and was silent .
Parsing [sent. 1042 len. 27]: The day was breaking , and I could just see him as he lay ; but he said no more , and appeared to breathe heavily .
Parsing [sent. 1043 len. 26]: As the sun rose , I got out of my bed-place ; and , now that it was broad daylight , I looked at Jackson .
Parsing [sent. 1044 len. 24]: He was lying on his back ; his brow was covered with large drops of perspiration , and his hands were clenched together .
Parsing [sent. 1045 len. 25]: Although asleep , he appeared , by the convulsive twitching of the muscles of his face , to be suffering and in great agony .
Parsing [sent. 1046 len. 19]: Occasionally he groaned deeply , and his lips appeared to move , but no sound proceeded from them .
Parsing [sent. 1047 len. 18]: I perceived that the pannikin of liquor was not finished , one-third at least having been left .
Parsing [sent. 1048 len. 25]: Chapter XI I then went out of the cabin and took my usual seat , and began to reflect upon what I had heard .
Parsing [sent. 1049 len. 56]: He had talked about diamonds ; now I knew what diamonds were , so far as they were of great value , for I had read of them in the Bible , and Jackson had explained the value of precious stones to me , and had told me of diamonds of very great value indeed .
Parsing [sent. 1050 len. 21]: Then he said that they were Henniker 's diamonds -- he must have meant my father , that was positive .
Parsing [sent. 1051 len. 26]: And that no one could prove they were his -- this implied that Jackson had no right to them ; indeed how could he have ?
Parsing [sent. 1052 len. 24]: And then I recalled to mind his having a secret hiding place under his bed , where I presumed the diamonds were deposited .
Parsing [sent. 1053 len. 56]: I then turned over in my mind what he had told me relative to the death of my father , the captain , and my mother , how confused he was , and how glad he was to get rid of the subject , and how unsatisfactory I thought his account was at the time .
Parsing [sent. 1054 len. 38]: After much cogitation , I made up my mind that Jackson had not told me the truth , and that there was a mystery yet to be explained ; but how was I to get at it ?
Parsing [sent. 1055 len. 6]: There was but one way .
Parsing [sent. 1056 len. 6]: The liquor made him talk .
Parsing [sent. 1057 len. 19]: I would supply him with liquor , and by degrees I would get the truth out of him .
Parsing [sent. 1058 len. 27]: At the same time I would not allow him to suppose that he had said anything to commit himself , or that I had any suspicions .
Parsing [sent. 1059 len. 27]: How naturally do we fall into treachery and deceit , from the evil in our own hearts , without any assistance or example from the world .
Parsing [sent. 1060 len. 7]: How could I have learnt deceit ?
Parsing [sent. 1061 len. 13]: Isolated as I had been , must it not have been innate ?
Parsing [sent. 1062 len. 26]: I returned to the cabin , and woke Jackson without much difficulty , since he had not drunk so much as on the previous night .
Parsing [sent. 1063 len. 8]: `` How are you this morning ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1064 len. 15]: said I. `` Not very well ; I have had some bad dreams . ''
Parsing [sent. 1065 len. 31]: `` Well you sang me some beautiful songs , '' replied I. `` Yes , I recollect , '' said he ; `` but I fell asleep at last . ''
Parsing [sent. 1066 len. 19]: `` Yes , you refused to sing any more , and went off in a loud snore . ''
Parsing [sent. 1067 len. 14]: Jackson got out of his bed-place , and I gave him his meal .
Parsing [sent. 1068 len. 20]: We talked during the whole day about singing , and I hummed the air which had pleased me most .
Parsing [sent. 1069 len. 22]: `` You have got the air pretty correct , '' said he ; `` you must have an ear for music .
Parsing [sent. 1070 len. 8]: Have you ever tried to sing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1071 len. 12]: `` No , never ; you know I have not . ''
Parsing [sent. 1072 len. 12]: `` You might have tried when I was not with you .
Parsing [sent. 1073 len. 3]: Try now .
Parsing [sent. 1074 len. 16]: I will sing a tune , and then do you repeat it after me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1075 len. 9]: He did so , and I repeated it .
Parsing [sent. 1076 len. 8]: `` Very good , '' said he .
Parsing [sent. 1077 len. 11]: `` Let 's try the compass of your voice . ''
Parsing [sent. 1078 len. 11]: He ran up the gamut , and I followed him .
Parsing [sent. 1079 len. 34]: `` I think you can go higher than I can , '' said he , `` however you go quite high enough , so now I 'll give you a singing lesson . ''
Parsing [sent. 1080 len. 26]: Thus were we occupied at intervals during the whole day , for Jackson would not allow me to try my voice too much at first .
Parsing [sent. 1081 len. 59]: As the evening fell , he again asked me to fetch some liquor , and as I had three quart wine bottles , as I before mentioned , which I had found in the chest , I took them down to fill , as it would save me many trips , and be more convenient in every respect .
Parsing [sent. 1082 len. 35]: I brought them up full , and Jackson stopped them up with some of the rags which I had torn to bind round his wrist , and put them all three in his bed-place .
Parsing [sent. 1083 len. 44]: `` That will be a much better arrangement , '' said he , `` as now I can pour out the liquor into the pannikin as I want it ; besides , I mean to take a little water with it in future .
Parsing [sent. 1084 len. 24]: It 's not quite so good with water , but it lasts longer , and one do n't go to sleep so soon .
Parsing [sent. 1085 len. 19]: Well , I little thought that I should have such a comfort sent me after all my sufferings .
Parsing [sent. 1086 len. 11]: I do n't so much care now about staying here .
Parsing [sent. 1087 len. 10]: Go and fetch some water in the pannikin . ''
Parsing [sent. 1088 len. 9]: That night was a repetition of the first .
Parsing [sent. 1089 len. 36]: Jackson sang till he was intoxicated , and then fell fast asleep , not talking or saying a word , and I was disappointed , for I remained awake to catch anything he might say .
Parsing [sent. 1090 len. 51]: It would be tedious to repeat what took place for about a month ; -- suffice it to say it was very rarely , during that time , that Jackson said anything in his sleep , or drunken state , and what he did say I could make nothing of .
Parsing [sent. 1091 len. 24]: He continued , in the daytime , to give me lessons in singing , and I could now sing several songs very correctly .
Parsing [sent. 1092 len. 22]: At night , he returned to his usual habit , and was more or less intoxicated before the night was over .
Parsing [sent. 1093 len. 26]: I perceived , however , that this excess had a great effect upon his constitution , and that he had become very pale and haggard .
Parsing [sent. 1094 len. 53]: Impatient as I felt to find out the truth , I concealed my feelings towards him -LRB- which had certainly very much changed again since the discovery I had made and the suspicions I had formed -RRB- and I remained on the best of terms with him , resolving to wait patiently .
Parsing [sent. 1095 len. 23]: He had spoken once , and therefore I argued that he would speak again , nor was I wrong in my calculations .
Parsing [sent. 1096 len. 50]: One night , after he had finished his usual allowance of liquor , and had composed himself for sleep , I observed that he was unusually restless , changing his position in his bed-place every few minutes , and , at last , he muttered , `` Captain James .
Parsing [sent. 1097 len. 10]: Well , what of Captain James , eh ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1098 len. 12]: A thought struck me that he might reply to a question .
Parsing [sent. 1099 len. 7]: `` How did he die ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1100 len. 9]: said I , in a low clear voice .
Parsing [sent. 1101 len. 4]: `` Die ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1102 len. 10]: replied Jackson , `` he fell down the cliff .
Parsing [sent. 1103 len. 5]: Yes , he did .
Parsing [sent. 1104 len. 8]: You ca n't say I killed him .
Parsing [sent. 1105 len. 10]: No -- never put my finger on him . ''
Parsing [sent. 1106 len. 15]: After that , he was silent for some time , and then he recommenced .
Parsing [sent. 1107 len. 53]: `` She always said that I destroyed them both , but I did not -- only one -- yes , one , I grant -- but I hated him -- no , not for his diamonds -- no , no -- if you said his wife indeed -- love and hate . ''
Parsing [sent. 1108 len. 17]: `` Then you killed him for love of his wife , and hate of himself ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1109 len. 6]: `` Yes , I did .
Parsing [sent. 1110 len. 8]: Who are you that have guessed that ?
Parsing [sent. 1111 len. 4]: Who are you ?
Parsing [sent. 1112 len. 7]: I 'll have your life . ''
Parsing [sent. 1113 len. 29]: As he said this , he started up in his bed-place , awakened by his dream , and probably by my voice , which he had replied to .
Parsing [sent. 1114 len. 5]: `` Who spoke ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1115 len. 3]: said he .
Parsing [sent. 1116 len. 9]: `` Frank Henniker , did you speak ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1117 len. 23]: I made no reply , but pretended to be sound asleep , as he still sat up , as if watching me .
Parsing [sent. 1118 len. 5]: I feigned a snore .
Parsing [sent. 1119 len. 18]: `` It could not have been him , '' muttered Jackson , `` he 's quite fast .
Parsing [sent. 1120 len. 7]: Mercy , what a dream ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1121 len. 36]: He then sank down in his bed-place , and I heard the gurgling noise which told me that he had put the bottle of liquor to his mouth , and was drinking out of it .
Parsing [sent. 1122 len. 16]: From the time that the gurgling lasted , he must have taken a great deal .
Parsing [sent. 1123 len. 8]: At last , all was quiet again .
Parsing [sent. 1124 len. 23]: `` So I have discovered it at last , '' said I , as my blood boiled at what I had heard .
Parsing [sent. 1125 len. 7]: `` He did murder my father .
Parsing [sent. 1126 len. 9]: Shall I kill him while he sleeps ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1127 len. 11]: was the first thought that came into my troubled mind .
Parsing [sent. 1128 len. 9]: `` No , I wo n't do that .
Parsing [sent. 1129 len. 20]: What then , shall I tax him with it when he is awake , and then kill him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1130 len. 29]: but I thought , that , as he was blind , and unable to defend himself , it would be cowardly , and I could not do that .
Parsing [sent. 1131 len. 7]: What then was I to do ?
Parsing [sent. 1132 len. 121]: and as I cooled down , I thought of the words of the Bible , that we were to return good for evil ; for Jackson , of whom , when I read it , I asked why we were told to do so , had explained it to me , and afterwards when I came to the part which said , `` Vengeance is mine , saith the Lord , '' he had told me that there was punishment for the wicked hereafter , and that was the reason why we were not to obey the Jewish law of `` an eye for an eye , and a tooth for a tooth , '' which I had referred to .
Parsing [sent. 1133 len. 26]: This portion of the Bible he had well explained , and certain it is that it prevented my raising my hand against him that night .
Parsing [sent. 1134 len. 53]: Still , I remained in a state of great excitement ; I felt that it would be impossible for me to be any longer on good terms with him , and I revolved the question in my mind , till at last , worn out by excitement , I fell fast asleep .
Parsing [sent. 1135 len. 69]: A short time before daylight , I started up at what I thought was a faint cry , but I listened , and hearing nothing more , I again fell asleep , and it was broad daylight when I arose ; my first thoughts were naturally of Jackson , and I looked at where he lay , but he was no longer there -- his bed-place was empty .
Parsing [sent. 1136 len. 42]: I was astonished , and after a moment 's thought , I recollected the cry I had heard in the night , and I ran out of the cabin and looked around me , but I could see nothing of him .
Parsing [sent. 1137 len. 38]: I then went to the edge of the flat rock upon which the cabin was built and looked over it ; it was about thirty feet from this rock to the one below , and nearly perpendicular .
Parsing [sent. 1138 len. 35]: I thought that he must have gone out in the night , when intoxicated with liquor , and have fallen down the precipice ; but I did not see him as I peered over .
Parsing [sent. 1139 len. 45]: `` He must have gone for water , '' thought I , and I ran to the corner of the rock , where the precipice was much deeper , and looking over , I perceived him lying down below without motion or apparent life .
Parsing [sent. 1140 len. 8]: I had , then , judged rightly .
Parsing [sent. 1141 len. 41]: I sat down by the side of the pool of water quite overpowered ; last night I had been planning how I should destroy him , and now he lay dead before me without my being guilty of the crime .
Parsing [sent. 1142 len. 28]: `` Vengeance is mine , saith the Lord , '' were the words that first escaped my lips ; and I remained many minutes in deep thought .
Parsing [sent. 1143 len. 36]: At last it occurred to me that he might not yet be dead ; I ran down the cliff , and , clambering over the rocks , arrived breathless at the spot where Jackson lay .
Parsing [sent. 1144 len. 9]: He groaned heavily as I stood by him .
Parsing [sent. 1145 len. 19]: `` Jackson , '' said I , kneeling down by him , `` are you much hurt ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1146 len. 15]: for all my feelings of animosity had vanished when I perceived his unhappy condition .
Parsing [sent. 1147 len. 12]: His lips moved , but he did not utter any sound .
Parsing [sent. 1148 len. 14]: At last he said , in a low voice , `` Water . ''
Parsing [sent. 1149 len. 32]: I hastened back as fast as I could to the cabin , got a pannikin half full of water , and poured a little rum in it out of the bottle .
Parsing [sent. 1150 len. 12]: This journey and my return to him occupied some ten minutes .
Parsing [sent. 1151 len. 13]: I put it to his lips , and he seemed to revive .
Parsing [sent. 1152 len. 9]: He was a dreadful object to look at .
Parsing [sent. 1153 len. 22]: The blood from a cut on his head had poured over his face and beard , which were clotted with gore .
Parsing [sent. 1154 len. 11]: How to remove him to the cabin I knew not .
Parsing [sent. 1155 len. 41]: It would be hardly possible for me to carry him over the broken rocks which I had climbed to arrive at where he lay ; and there was no other way but what was longer , and just as difficult .
Parsing [sent. 1156 len. 32]: By degrees he appeared to recover ; I gave him more of the contents of the pannikin , and at last he could speak , although with great pain and difficulty .
Parsing [sent. 1157 len. 12]: As he did so he put his hand to his side .
Parsing [sent. 1158 len. 25]: He was indeed a ghastly object , with his sightless eyeballs , his livid lips , and his face and beard matted with blood .
Parsing [sent. 1159 len. 17]: `` Do you think you could get to the cabin , if I helped you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1160 len. 20]: said I. `` I shall never get there -- let me die where I am , '' said he .
Parsing [sent. 1161 len. 52]: `` But the cut on your head is not very deep , '' replied I. `` No , I do n't feel it ; -- but -- my side -- I bleed inwardly -- I am -- broken to pieces , '' said he , pausing and gasping between each word .
Parsing [sent. 1162 len. 17]: I looked at his side , and perceived that it was already black and much swollen .
Parsing [sent. 1163 len. 20]: I offered him more drink , which he took eagerly , and I then returned for a further supply .
Parsing [sent. 1164 len. 25]: I filled two of the wine-bottles with water and a small drop of spirits as before , and went back to where he lay .
Parsing [sent. 1165 len. 23]: I found him more recovered , and I had hopes that he might still do well , and I told him so .
Parsing [sent. 1166 len. 23]: `` No , no , '' replied he ; `` I have but a few hours to live -- I feel that .
Parsing [sent. 1167 len. 11]: Let me die here , and die in peace . ''
Parsing [sent. 1168 len. 32]: He then sank into a sort of stupor , occasioned , I presume , by what I had given him to drink , and remained quite quiet , and breathing heavily .
Parsing [sent. 1169 len. 41]: I sat by him waiting till he should rouse up again ; for more than an hour I was in a very confused state of mind , as may well be imagined , after what had passed in the night .
Parsing [sent. 1170 len. 31]: Chapter XII What I most thought of was obtaining from him , now that he was dying , the full truth as to the deaths of my father and mother .
Parsing [sent. 1171 len. 36]: Jackson remained so long in this state of stupor , I feared that he would die before I could interrogate him ; but this , as it proved , was not to be the case .
Parsing [sent. 1172 len. 24]: I waited another hour , very impatiently I must acknowledge , and then I went to him and asked him how he felt .
Parsing [sent. 1173 len. 16]: He replied immediately , and without that difficulty which he appeared before to have experienced .
Parsing [sent. 1174 len. 98]: `` I am better now -- the inward bleeding has stopped ; but still I can not live -- my side is broken in , I do not think there is a rib that is not fractured into pieces , and my spine is injured , for I can not move or feel my legs ; but I may live many hours yet , and I thank God for His mercy in allowing me so much time -- short indeed to make reparation for so bad a life , but still nothing is impossible with God . ''
Parsing [sent. 1175 len. 60]: `` Well , then , '' replied I , `` if you can speak , I wish you would tell me the truth relative to my father 's death , and also about the death of others ; as for my father I know that you murdered him -- for you said so last night in your sleep . ''
Parsing [sent. 1176 len. 42]: After a pause , Jackson replied -- `` I am glad that I did , and that you have told me so -- I wished to make a full confession even to you , for confession is a proof of repentance .
Parsing [sent. 1177 len. 49]: I know that you must hate me , and will hate my memory , and I can not be surprised at it ; but look at me now , Frank , and ask your own heart whether I am not more an object of pity than of hatred .
Parsing [sent. 1178 len. 10]: ` Vengeance is mine , saith the Lord ! '
Parsing [sent. 1179 len. 13]: and has not His vengeance fallen upon me even in this world ?
Parsing [sent. 1180 len. 94]: Look at me ; here I am , separated from the world that I loved so much , with no chance of ever joining it -- possessed of wealth which would but a few months ago have made me happy -- now blind , crushed to pieces by an avenging God , in whose presence I must shortly appear to answer for all my wickedness -- all my expectations overthrown , all my hopes destroyed , and all my accumulated sins procuring me nothing , but , it may be , eternal condemnation .
Parsing [sent. 1181 len. 16]: I ask you again , am I not an object of pity and commiseration ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1182 len. 11]: I could but assent to this , and he proceeded .
Parsing [sent. 1183 len. 9]: `` I will now tell you the truth .
Parsing [sent. 1184 len. 40]: I did tell the truth up to the time of your father and mother 's embarkation on board of the brig , up to when the gale of wind came on which occasioned eventually the loss of the ship .
Parsing [sent. 1185 len. 7]: Now give me a little drink .
Parsing [sent. 1186 len. 41]: `` The vessel was so tossed by the storm , and the waves broke over her so continually , that the between-decks were full of water , and as the hatches were kept down , the heat was most oppressive .
Parsing [sent. 1187 len. 20]: When it was not my watch I remained below , and looked out for another berth to sleep in .
Parsing [sent. 1188 len. 30]: Before the cabin bulkheads on the starboard side , the captain had fitted up a sort of sail-room to contain the spare sails in case we should require them .
Parsing [sent. 1189 len. 59]: It was about eight feet square , and the sails were piled up in it , so as to reach within two feet of the deck overhead ; though the lower ones were wetted with the water , above they were dry , and I took this berth on the top of the sails as my sleeping place .
Parsing [sent. 1190 len. 64]: Now the state-room in which your father and mother slept was on the other side of the cabin bulkhead , and the straining and rolling of the vessel had opened the chinks between the planks , so that I could see a great deal of what was done in the state-room , and could hear every word almost that was spoken by them .
Parsing [sent. 1191 len. 44]: I was not aware of this when I selected this place as my berth , but I found it out on the first night , the light of the candle shining through the chinks into the darkness by which I was surrounded outside .
Parsing [sent. 1192 len. 64]: Of course , it is when a man is alone with his wife that he talks on confidential subjects ; that I knew well , and hoped by listening to be able to make some discovery ; -- what , I had no idea of ; but , with the bad feelings which stimulated me , I determined not to lose an opportunity .
Parsing [sent. 1193 len. 20]: It was not till about a week after I had selected this berth , that I made any discovery .
Parsing [sent. 1194 len. 18]: I had had the watch from six to eight o'clock , and had gone to bed early .
Parsing [sent. 1195 len. 10]: About nine o'clock your father came into the state-room .
Parsing [sent. 1196 len. 7]: Your mother was already in bed .
Parsing [sent. 1197 len. 25]: As your father undressed , your mother said , ` Does not that belt worry you a great deal , my dear ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 1198 len. 41]: ` No , ' replied your father , ' I am used to it now ; it did when I first put it on , but now I have had it on four days , I do not feel it .
Parsing [sent. 1199 len. 39]: I shall keep it on as long as this weather lasts ; there is no saying what may happen , and it will not do to be looking for the belt at a moment 's warning . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 1200 len. 13]: ` Do you think then that we are in danger ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 1201 len. 22]: ` No , not particularly so , but the storm is very fierce , and the vessel is old and weak .
Parsing [sent. 1202 len. 52]: We may have fine weather in a day or two , or we may not ; at all events , when property of value is at stake , and that property not my own , I should feel myself very culpable , if I did not take every precaution . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 1203 len. 33]: ` Well -- I wish we were safe home again , my dear , and that my father had his diamonds , but we are in the hands of God . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 1204 len. 14]: ` Yes , I must trust to Him , ' replied your father .
Parsing [sent. 1205 len. 49]: `` This circumstance induced me to look through one of the chinks of the bulkhead , so that I could see your father , and I perceived that he was unbuckling a belt which was round his body , and which no doubt contained the diamonds referred to .
Parsing [sent. 1206 len. 29]: It was of soft leather , and about eight inches wide , sewed lengthways and breadthways in small squares , in which I presumed the diamonds were deposited .
Parsing [sent. 1207 len. 10]: After a time your mother spoke again . '' '
Parsing [sent. 1208 len. 16]: I really think , Henniker , that I ought to wear the belt . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 1209 len. 9]: ` Why so , my dear ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 1210 len. 15]: ` Because it might be the means of my preservation in case of accident .
Parsing [sent. 1211 len. 36]: Suppose now , we were obliged to abandon the vessel and take to the boats ; a husband , in his hurry , might forget his wife , but he would not forget his diamonds .
Parsing [sent. 1212 len. 19]: If I wore the belt , you would be certain to put me in the boat . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 1213 len. 39]: ` That observation of yours would have force with some husbands , and some wives , ' retorted your father ; ` but as I have a firm belief in the Scriptures , it does not affect me .
Parsing [sent. 1214 len. 6]: What do the Proverbs say ?
Parsing [sent. 1215 len. 34]: `` The price of a virtuous woman is far above rubies ; '' and a good ruby is worth even more in the market than a diamond of the same size . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 1216 len. 19]: ` Well , I must comfort myself with that idea , ' replied your mother , laughing . ''
Parsing [sent. 1217 len. 26]: ` Supposing we be thrown upon some out-of-the-way place , ' said your father , ' I shall then commit the belt to your charge .
Parsing [sent. 1218 len. 24]: It might soon be discovered on my person , whereas , on yours , it would stand every chance of being long concealed .
Parsing [sent. 1219 len. 34]: I say this because , even in a desert , it would be dangerous to have it known by unscrupulous and unprincipled men that anyone had so much wealth about him . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 1220 len. 38]: ` Well , ' replied your mother , ` that is also comfortable for me to hear , for you will not leave me behind , because I shall be necessary to conceal your treasure . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 1221 len. 22]: ` Yes , ' replied your father , laughing , ` there is another chance for you , you see . '
Parsing [sent. 1222 len. 21]: `` Your father then extinguished the light , and the conversation was not renewed ; but I had heard enough .
Parsing [sent. 1223 len. 38]: Your father carried a great treasure about his person -- wealth , I took it for granted , that if I once could obtain , and return to England , would save me from my present position .
Parsing [sent. 1224 len. 34]: My avarice was hereby excited , and thus another passion equally powerful , and equally inciting to evil deeds , was added to the hate which I already had imbibed for your father .
Parsing [sent. 1225 len. 8]: But I must leave off now . ''
Parsing [sent. 1226 len. 42]: Jackson drank a little more , and then remained quiet , and as I had had no food that day , I took the opportunity of returning to the cabin , with the promise that I would be back very soon .
Parsing [sent. 1227 len. 34]: In half an hour I returned , bringing with me the Bible and Prayer-book , as I thought that he would ask me to read to him after he had made his confession .
Parsing [sent. 1228 len. 17]: I found him breathing heavily , and apparently asleep , so I did not wake him .
Parsing [sent. 1229 len. 23]: As I looked at him , and recalled to mind his words , `` Am not I an object of pity ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1230 len. 26]: I confessed that he was , and then I asked myself the question , Can you forgive him who was the murderer of your father ?
Parsing [sent. 1231 len. 10]: After some reflection , I thought that I could .
Parsing [sent. 1232 len. 6]: Was he not already punished ?
Parsing [sent. 1233 len. 8]: Had not the murder been already avenged ?
Parsing [sent. 1234 len. 48]: It was not possible to retain animosity against one so stricken , so broken to pieces , and my heart smote me when I looked at his disabled hand , and felt that I , boy as I was , had had a share in his marring .
Parsing [sent. 1235 len. 5]: At last he spoke .
Parsing [sent. 1236 len. 8]: `` Are you there , Frank ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1237 len. 18]: `` Yes , '' replied I. `` I have had a little sleep , '' said he .
Parsing [sent. 1238 len. 7]: `` Do you feel easier ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1239 len. 4]: inquired I kindly .
Parsing [sent. 1240 len. 20]: `` Yes , I feel my side more numbed , and so it will remain till mortification takes place .
Parsing [sent. 1241 len. 32]: But let me finish my confession ; I wish to relieve my mind , not that I shall die to-night , or perhaps to-morrow , but still I wish it over .
Parsing [sent. 1242 len. 25]: Come nearer to me , that I may speak in a lower voice , and then I shall be able to speak longer . ''
Parsing [sent. 1243 len. 8]: I did so , and he proceeded .
Parsing [sent. 1244 len. 18]: `` You know how we were cast upon this island , and how I behaved at first .
Parsing [sent. 1245 len. 30]: When I afterwards took my place with the others , my evil thoughts gradually quitted me , and I gave up all idea of any injury to your father .
Parsing [sent. 1246 len. 7]: But this did not last long .
Parsing [sent. 1247 len. 33]: The deaths of so many , and at last the captain your father and your mother being the only ones left on the island besides myself , once more excited my cupidity .
Parsing [sent. 1248 len. 36]: I thought again of the belt of diamonds , and by what means I should gain possession of it ; and the devil suggested to me the murders of the captain and of your father .
Parsing [sent. 1249 len. 41]: I had ascertained that your father no longer carried the belt on his person when we all used to bathe at the bathing-pool ; it was , therefore , as your father had proposed , in your mother 's keeping .
Parsing [sent. 1250 len. 18]: Having once made up my mind , I watched every opportunity to put my intentions into execution .
Parsing [sent. 1251 len. 54]: It was the custom for one of us to fish every morning , as your mother would not eat the dried birds , if fish could be procured , and I considered that the only chance I had of executing my horrible wish was when your father went to fish off the rocks .
Parsing [sent. 1252 len. 50]: We usually did so off the ledge of rocks which divide the bathing-pool from the sea , but I found out another place , where more fish , and of a better quality , were to be taken , which is off the high wall of rocks just below .
Parsing [sent. 1253 len. 27]: You know where I mean , I have often sent you to fish there , but I never could go myself since your father 's death .
Parsing [sent. 1254 len. 60]: Your father took his lines there , and was hauling in a large fish , when I , who had concealed myself close to where he stood , watched the opportunity as he looked over the rock to see if the fish was clear of the water , to come behind him and throw him off into the sea .
Parsing [sent. 1255 len. 34]: He could not swim , I knew , and after waiting a minute or two , I looked over and saw his body , just as it sank , after his last struggles .
Parsing [sent. 1256 len. 50]: I then hastened away , and my guilty conscience induced me to ascend the ravine , and collect a faggot of firewood to bring home , that no suspicions might be entertained ; but my so doing was the very cause of suspicion , as you will afterwards perceive .
Parsing [sent. 1257 len. 39]: I returned with the wood , and the captain observed , when I came up to the cabin : '' ` Why , it 's something new for you to collect wood out of your turn , Jackson .
Parsing [sent. 1258 len. 7]: Wonders will never cease . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 1259 len. 49]: ` The fact is , that I am becoming very amiable , ' replied I , hardly knowing what to say , and afraid to look either of them in the face , for your mother , with you on her lap , was standing close by . ''
Parsing [sent. 1260 len. 15]: ` Has my husband caught any fish , do you know , Jackson ? '
Parsing [sent. 1261 len. 17]: said your mother , ` for it is high time that he came home . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 1262 len. 7]: ` How can I tell ? '
Parsing [sent. 1263 len. 14]: replied I. ' I have been up the ravine for wood . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 1264 len. 28]: ` But you were down on the rock two hours ago , ' replied your mother , ` for Captain James saw you coming away . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 1265 len. 11]: ` That I certainly did , ' replied the captain .
Parsing [sent. 1266 len. 13]: ` Had he caught any fish when you were with him ? '
Parsing [sent. 1267 len. 34]: `` They must have perceived my confusion when I said , ` Yes , I was on the rocks , but I never went near Henniker , that I 'll swear . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 1268 len. 21]: ` You must have been near him , even when I saw you , ' replied the captain . '' '
Parsing [sent. 1269 len. 38]: I never looked at him , if I was , ' replied I. '' ` Well , then , one of us had better go down and see what he is about , ' said the captain .
Parsing [sent. 1270 len. 10]: ` Shall I leave Jackson with you ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 1271 len. 26]: ` Yes , yes , ' replied your mother , much agitated , ` for I have my forebodings ; better leave him here . '
Parsing [sent. 1272 len. 31]: `` The captain hastened down to the rocks , and in a quarter of an hour returned very much heated , saying , ` He is not there ! ' ''
Parsing [sent. 1273 len. 5]: ` Not there ? '
Parsing [sent. 1274 len. 30]: replied I , getting up , for I had seated myself in silence on the rock during the captain 's absence : ` that 's very odd . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 1275 len. 9]: ` It is , ' replied the captain .
Parsing [sent. 1276 len. 21]: ` Jackson , go and try if you see anything of him , while I attend to Mrs Henniker . '
Parsing [sent. 1277 len. 27]: `` Your mother , on the captain 's return , had bowed her head down to her knees , and covered her face with her hands .
Parsing [sent. 1278 len. 21]: I was glad of an excuse to be away , for my heart smote me as I witnessed her condition .
Parsing [sent. 1279 len. 20]: `` I remained away half-an-hour , and then returned , saying that I could see nothing of your father .
Parsing [sent. 1280 len. 30]: `` Your mother was in the cabin , and the captain went in to her , while I remained outside with all the feelings of Cain upon my brow .
Parsing [sent. 1281 len. 15]: `` That was a dreadful day for all parties -- no food was taken .
Parsing [sent. 1282 len. 25]: Your mother and the captain remained in the cabin , and I dared not , as usual , go in to my own bed-place .
Parsing [sent. 1283 len. 32]: I lay all night upon the rocks -- sleep I could not ; every moment I saw your father 's body sinking , as I had seen it in the morning .
Parsing [sent. 1284 len. 10]: The next morning the captain came out to me .
Parsing [sent. 1285 len. 21]: He was very grave and stern , but he could not accuse me , whatever his suspicions might have been .
Parsing [sent. 1286 len. 49]: It was a week before I saw your mother again , for I dared not intrude into her presence ; but , finding there was no accusation against me , I recovered my spirits , and returned to the cabin , and things went on as before . ''
Parsing [sent. 1287 len. 33]: Chapter XIII `` One thing , however , was evident , that your mother had an aversion -- I may say a horror -- of me , which she could not conceal .
Parsing [sent. 1288 len. 24]: She said nothing , but she never could look at me ; and to any question I put , would seldom make reply .
Parsing [sent. 1289 len. 29]: Strange to say this treatment of hers produced quite a different effect from what might have been anticipated , and I felt my former love for her revive .
Parsing [sent. 1290 len. 16]: Her shrinking from me made me more familiar towards her , and increased her disgust .
Parsing [sent. 1291 len. 23]: I assumed a jocose air with her , and at times Captain James considered it his duty to interfere and check me .
Parsing [sent. 1292 len. 78]: He was a very powerful man , and in a contest would have proved my master ; this I knew , and this knowledge compelled me to be more respectful to your mother in his presence , but when his back was turned I became so disgustingly familiar , that at last your mother requested that whether fishing or collecting wood , instead of going out by turns we should both go , and leave her alone .
Parsing [sent. 1293 len. 34]: This I could not well refuse , as Captain James would in all probability have used force if I had not consented , but my hatred to him was in consequence most unbounded .
Parsing [sent. 1294 len. 27]: However , an event took place which relieved me from the subjection which I was under , and left me alone with you and your mother .
Parsing [sent. 1295 len. 7]: Now I must rest a little .
Parsing [sent. 1296 len. 12]: Wait another hour , and you shall know the rest . ''
Parsing [sent. 1297 len. 36]: It was now late in the evening , but there was a bright moon which shone over head , and the broad light and shadow made the rocks around us appear peculiarly wild and rugged .
Parsing [sent. 1298 len. 40]: They towered up one above the other till they met the dark blue of the sky in which the stars twinkled but faintly , while the moon sailed through the ether , without a cloud to obscure her radiance .
Parsing [sent. 1299 len. 37]: And in this majestic scenery were found but two living beings -- a poor boy and a mangled wretch -- a murderer -- soon to breathe his last , and be summoned before an offended God .
Parsing [sent. 1300 len. 48]: As I remained motionless by his side , I felt , as I looked up , a sensation of awe , but not of fear ; I thought to myself -- `` And God made all this and all the world besides , and me and him .
Parsing [sent. 1301 len. 60]: The Bible said so : '' and my speculation then was as to what God must be , for although I had read the Bible , I had but a confused idea , and had it been asked me , as it was of the man in the chariot by Philip , `` Understandest thou what thou readest ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1302 len. 9]: I most certainly should have answered , No .
Parsing [sent. 1303 len. 22]: I remained for nearly two hours in this reverie , and at last fell asleep with my back against the rock .
Parsing [sent. 1304 len. 22]: I was , however , wakened up by Jackson 's voice , when he asked in a low tone for water .
Parsing [sent. 1305 len. 14]: `` There it is , '' said I , handing it to him .
Parsing [sent. 1306 len. 7]: `` Have you called long ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1307 len. 14]: `` No , '' replied he ; `` I asked but once . ''
Parsing [sent. 1308 len. 10]: `` I have been asleep , '' said I .
Parsing [sent. 1309 len. 23]: As soon as he had drunk , he said -- `` I will finish now ; my side begins to burn . ''
Parsing [sent. 1310 len. 29]: He then proceeded -- `` It was about four months after your father 's death that Captain James and I went together to the ravine to collect firewood .
Parsing [sent. 1311 len. 40]: We passed under the wall of rock , which you know so well , and went through the gap , as we call it , when Captain James left the water-course and walked along the edge of the wall .
Parsing [sent. 1312 len. 23]: I followed him ; we both of us had our pieces of rope in our hands with which we tied the faggots .
Parsing [sent. 1313 len. 48]: Of a sudden his foot slipped , and he rolled down to the edge of the rock , but catching hold of a small bush which had fixed its roots in the rocks , he saved himself when his body was hanging half over the precipice . ''
Parsing [sent. 1314 len. 24]: ` Give me the end of your rope , ' said he to me , perfectly collected , although in such danger . ''
Parsing [sent. 1315 len. 35]: ` Yes , ' replied I , and I intended so to do , as I perceived that if I refused he could still have saved himself by the bush to which he clung .
Parsing [sent. 1316 len. 32]: `` But the bush began to loosen and give way , and Captain James perceiving it cried out -- '' ` Quick , quick , the bush is giving way ! '
Parsing [sent. 1317 len. 14]: `` This assertion of his determined me not to give him the rope .
Parsing [sent. 1318 len. 37]: I pretended to be in a great hurry to do so , but entangled it about my legs , and then appeared occupied in clearing it , when he cried again -- '' ` Quick ! '
Parsing [sent. 1319 len. 22]: -- and hardly had he said the word when the root of the bush snapped , and down he fell below .
Parsing [sent. 1320 len. 13]: `` I heard the crash as he came to the rock beneath .
Parsing [sent. 1321 len. 23]: See the judgment of God -- am I not now precisely in his position , lying battered and crushed as he was ?
Parsing [sent. 1322 len. 16]: After a time I went down to where he lay , and found him expiring .
Parsing [sent. 1323 len. 17]: He had just strength to say ` God forgive you , ' and then he died .
Parsing [sent. 1324 len. 24]: It was murder , for I could have saved him and would not , and yet he prayed to God to forgive me .
Parsing [sent. 1325 len. 14]: How much happier should I have felt if he had not said that .
Parsing [sent. 1326 len. 14]: His ` God forgive you ' rang in my ears for months afterwards .
Parsing [sent. 1327 len. 36]: I returned to the cabin , and with a bold air stated to your mother what had happened , for I felt I could say , this time , I did not do the deed .
Parsing [sent. 1328 len. 22]: She burst out into frantic exclamations , accusing me of being not only his murderer but the murderer of her husband .
Parsing [sent. 1329 len. 14]: I tried all I could do to appease her , but in vain .
Parsing [sent. 1330 len. 39]: For many weeks she was in a state of melancholy and despondency , that made me fear for her life ; but she had you still to bestow her affections upon , and for your sake she lived .
Parsing [sent. 1331 len. 6]: I soon made this discovery .
Parsing [sent. 1332 len. 21]: She was now wholly in my power , but I was awed by her looks even , for a time .
Parsing [sent. 1333 len. 24]: At last I became bolder , and spoke to her of our becoming man and wife ; she turned from me with abhorrence .
Parsing [sent. 1334 len. 7]: I then resorted to other means .
Parsing [sent. 1335 len. 24]: I prevented her from obtaining food ; she would have starved with pleasure , but she could not bear to see you suffer .
Parsing [sent. 1336 len. 58]: I will not detail my cruelty and barbarity towards her ; suffice to say , it was such that she pined away , and about six months after the death of the captain she died , exhorting me not to injure you , but if ever I had an opportunity , to take you to your grandfather .
Parsing [sent. 1337 len. 30]: I could not refuse this demand , made by a woman whom I as certainly killed by slow means as I had your father by a more sudden death .
Parsing [sent. 1338 len. 14]: I buried her in the guano , by the side of the others .
Parsing [sent. 1339 len. 15]: After her death my life was a torture to me for a long while .
Parsing [sent. 1340 len. 11]: I dared not kill you , but I hated you .
Parsing [sent. 1341 len. 47]: I had only one consolation , one hope , which occasionally gave me satisfaction ; the consolation , if so it could be called , was -- that I had possession of the diamonds ; the hope -- that I should one day see England again .
Parsing [sent. 1342 len. 12]: You see me now -- are they not all avenged ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1343 len. 13]: I could not but feel the truth of Jackson 's last sentence .
Parsing [sent. 1344 len. 5]: They were indeed avenged .
Parsing [sent. 1345 len. 46]: After a short pause , he said to me -- `` Now , Frank , I feel that the mortification in my side is making great progress , and , in a short time I shall be in too great pain to talk to you .
Parsing [sent. 1346 len. 21]: I have made a full confession of my crimes ; it is all the reparation I can make to you .
Parsing [sent. 1347 len. 7]: Now , can you forgive me ?
Parsing [sent. 1348 len. 11]: for I shall die very miserable if you do not .
Parsing [sent. 1349 len. 5]: Just look at me .
Parsing [sent. 1350 len. 11]: Can you feel resentment against one in my wretched state ?
Parsing [sent. 1351 len. 12]: Recollect that you pray to be forgiven as you forgive others .
Parsing [sent. 1352 len. 6]: Give me your answer . ''
Parsing [sent. 1353 len. 52]: `` I think -- yes , I feel that I can forgive you , Jackson , '' replied I. `` I shall soon be left alone on this island , and I am sure I should be much more miserable than I shall be , if I do not forgive you .
Parsing [sent. 1354 len. 6]: I do forgive you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1355 len. 15]: `` Thanks ; you are a good boy , and may God bless you .
Parsing [sent. 1356 len. 7]: Is it not nearly daylight ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1357 len. 6]: `` Yes , it is .
Parsing [sent. 1358 len. 14]: I shall soon be able to read the Bible or Prayer-book to you .
Parsing [sent. 1359 len. 7]: I have them both here . ''
Parsing [sent. 1360 len. 13]: `` The pain is too severe , and becomes worse every minute .
Parsing [sent. 1361 len. 35]: I shall not be able to listen to you now ; but I shall have some moments of quiet before I die ; and then -- '' Jackson groaned heavily , and ceased speaking .
Parsing [sent. 1362 len. 33]: For many hours he appeared to suffer much agony , which he vented in low groans ; the perspiration hung on his forehead in large beads , and his breathing became laborious .
Parsing [sent. 1363 len. 20]: The sun rose and had nearly set again before Jackson spoke ; at last he asked for some drink .
Parsing [sent. 1364 len. 11]: `` It is over now , '' said he faintly .
Parsing [sent. 1365 len. 13]: `` The pain is subsiding , and death is near at hand .
Parsing [sent. 1366 len. 31]: You may read to me now ; but , first , while I think of it , let me tell you where you will find your father 's property . ''
Parsing [sent. 1367 len. 16]: `` I know , '' replied I ; `` in your bed-place under the board .
Parsing [sent. 1368 len. 13]: I saw you remove it when you did not see me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1369 len. 3]: `` True .
Parsing [sent. 1370 len. 14]: I have no more to say ; it will all be over soon .
Parsing [sent. 1371 len. 43]: Read the burial service over me after I am dead ; and now , while still above , read me what you think I shall like best ; for I can not collect myself sufficiently to tell you what is most proper .
Parsing [sent. 1372 len. 5]: Indeed I hardly know .
Parsing [sent. 1373 len. 7]: But I can pray at times .
Parsing [sent. 1374 len. 4]: Read on . ''
Parsing [sent. 1375 len. 14]: I did so , and came upon the parable of the prodigal son .
Parsing [sent. 1376 len. 9]: `` That suits me , '' said Jackson .
Parsing [sent. 1377 len. 6]: `` Now let me pray .
Parsing [sent. 1378 len. 7]: Pray for me , Frank . ''
Parsing [sent. 1379 len. 18]: `` I do n't know how , '' replied I ; `` you never taught me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1380 len. 6]: `` Alas , no ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1381 len. 5]: Jackson was then silent .
Parsing [sent. 1382 len. 10]: I saw his pale lips move for some time .
Parsing [sent. 1383 len. 20]: I turned away for a few moments ; when I came back to him , he was no more !
Parsing [sent. 1384 len. 28]: His jaw had fallen ; and this being the first time that I had ever faced death , I looked upon the corpse with horror and dismay .
Parsing [sent. 1385 len. 32]: After a few minutes I left the body , and sat down on a rock at some distance from it , for I was somewhat afraid to be near to it .
Parsing [sent. 1386 len. 40]: On this rock I remained till the sun was sinking below the horizon ; when , alarmed at the idea of being there when it was dark , I took up my books and hastened back to the cabin .
Parsing [sent. 1387 len. 15]: I was giddy from excitement , and not having tasted food for many hours .
Parsing [sent. 1388 len. 50]: As soon as I had eaten , I lay down in my bed-place , intending to reflect upon what I was to do , now that I was alone ; but I was in a few moments fast asleep , and did not wake until the sun was high .
Parsing [sent. 1389 len. 34]: I arose much refreshed , and , seeing my Bible and Prayer-book close to my bed-place , I recollected my promise to Jackson that I would read the burial service over his body .
Parsing [sent. 1390 len. 37]: I found the place in the Prayer-book , for I had read it more than once before ; and , having just looked over it , I went with my book to where the body lay .
Parsing [sent. 1391 len. 14]: It presented a yet more hideous spectacle than it had the night before .
Parsing [sent. 1392 len. 9]: I read the service and closed the book .
Parsing [sent. 1393 len. 7]: `` What can I do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1394 len. 12]: thought I. `` I can not bury him in the guano .
Parsing [sent. 1395 len. 13]: It will be impossible to carry the body over these rocks . ''
Parsing [sent. 1396 len. 18]: Indeed , if it had been possible , I do not think I could have touched it .
Parsing [sent. 1397 len. 6]: I was afraid of it .
Parsing [sent. 1398 len. 27]: At last I determined that I would cover it up with the fragments of rocks which lay about in all directions , and I did so .
Parsing [sent. 1399 len. 32]: This occupied me about two hours , and then , carrying the bottles with me , I gladly hastened away from the spot , with a resolution never to revisit it .
Parsing [sent. 1400 len. 14]: I felt quite a relief when I was once more in the cabin .
Parsing [sent. 1401 len. 19]: I was alone , it was true , but I was no longer in contact with the dead .
Parsing [sent. 1402 len. 17]: I could not collect my thoughts or analyse my feelings during the remainder of the day .
Parsing [sent. 1403 len. 27]: I sat with my head resting on my hand , in the attitude of one thinking ; but at the same time my mind was vacant .
Parsing [sent. 1404 len. 26]: I once more lay down to sleep , and the following morning I found myself invigorated , and capable of acting as well as thinking .
Parsing [sent. 1405 len. 60]: I had a weight upon my spirits which I could not at first account for ; but it arose from the feeling that I was now alone , without a soul to speak to or communicate with ; my lips must now be closed till I again fell in with some of my fellow-creatures -- and was that likely ?
Parsing [sent. 1406 len. 24]: We had seen some of them perish not far from us , and that was all , during a period of many years .
Parsing [sent. 1407 len. 16]: Chapter XIV I was now , by Jackson 's account , nearly fourteen years old .
Parsing [sent. 1408 len. 12]: During fourteen years but one vessel had been seen by us .
Parsing [sent. 1409 len. 25]: It might be fourteen more , or double that time might elapse , before I should again fall in with any of my fellow-creatures .
Parsing [sent. 1410 len. 34]: As these thoughts saddened me , I felt how much I would have sacrificed if Jackson had remained alive , were it only for his company ; I would have forgiven him anything .
Parsing [sent. 1411 len. 20]: I even then felt as if , in the murderer of my father , I had lost a friend .
Parsing [sent. 1412 len. 74]: That day I was so unsettled I could not do anything ; I tried to read , but I could not ; I tried to eat , but my appetite was gone , I sat looking at the ocean as it rolled wave after wave , sometimes wondering whether it would ever bring a fellow-creature to join me ; at others I sat , and for hours , in perfect vacuity of thought .
Parsing [sent. 1413 len. 18]: The evening closed in ; it was dark , and I still remained seated where I was .
Parsing [sent. 1414 len. 24]: At last I returned to my bed , almost brokenhearted ; but fortunately I was soon asleep , and my sorrows were forgotten .
Parsing [sent. 1415 len. 37]: Another morning was gladdened with a brilliant sun , the dark blue ocean was scarcely ruffled by the breeze that swept over it , and I felt my spirits much revived , and my appetite returned .
Parsing [sent. 1416 len. 58]: After taking a meal , I remembered what Jackson had told me about the belt with the diamonds , and I went up to his bed-place , and turning out the bird 's skins and feathers , I raked up the gravel , which was not more than two inches deep , and came to the board .
Parsing [sent. 1417 len. 21]: I lifted it up , and found underneath a hole , about a foot deep , full of various articles .
Parsing [sent. 1418 len. 60]: There were the watch and sleeve buttons of the mate , some dollars wrapped in old rags , a tobacco-box , an old pipe , a brooch with hair forming initials , some letters which were signed J. Evelyn , and which I perceived were from my grandfather , and probably taken by Jackson after my mother 's death .
Parsing [sent. 1419 len. 46]: I say letters , because they were such , as I afterwards found out , but I had not then ever seen a letter , and my first attempt to decipher written hand was useless , although I did manage to make out the signature .
Parsing [sent. 1420 len. 33]: There was in the tobacco-box a plain gold wedding-ring , probably my mother 's ; and there was also a lock of long dark hair , which I presumed was hers also .
Parsing [sent. 1421 len. 31]: There were three or four specimens of what I afterwards found out to be gold and silver ores , a silver pencil-case , and a pair of small gold ear-rings .
Parsing [sent. 1422 len. 56]: At the bottom of the hole was the belt ; it was of soft leather , and I could feel a hard substance in it sewed in every square , which of course I presumed were the diamonds , but I did not cut one of the divisions open to see what was in them .
Parsing [sent. 1423 len. 29]: It had on the upper part of it , in very plain writing , `` The property of Mr J. Evelyn , 33 , Minories , London . ''
Parsing [sent. 1424 len. 26]: I examined all these articles one after another , and having satisfied my curiosity , I replaced them in the hole for a future survey .
Parsing [sent. 1425 len. 20]: I covered the hole with the board , and put back the gravel and the feathers into the bed-place .
Parsing [sent. 1426 len. 37]: This occupied me about two hours , and then I again took my former position on the rocks , and remained in a state of listless inactivity of body and mind the remainder of that day .
Parsing [sent. 1427 len. 21]: This state of prostration lasted for many days -- I may say for weeks , before it was altogether removed .
Parsing [sent. 1428 len. 22]: I could find no pleasure in my books , which were taken up , and after a few moments laid aside .
Parsing [sent. 1429 len. 18]: It was now within a month of the time that the birds should come to the island .
Parsing [sent. 1430 len. 24]: I was in no want of them for sustenance ; there were plenty left , but I almost loathed the sight of food .
Parsing [sent. 1431 len. 20]: The reader may inquire how it was that I knew the exact time of the arrival of the birds ?
Parsing [sent. 1432 len. 39]: I reply that the only reckoning ever kept by Jackson and me was the arrival of the full moons , and we also made a mark on the rock every time that the moon was at the full .
Parsing [sent. 1433 len. 34]: Thirteen moons were the quantity which we reckoned from the time of the birds appearing on the island one year , until their re-appearance the next ; and twelve moons had now passed .
Parsing [sent. 1434 len. 89]: At length , tired with everything , tired of myself , and I may say , almost tired of life , I one day took it into my head that I would take some provisions with me and a bottle to hold water , and go up the ravine , and cut firewood which should last me a long while ; and that I would remain up there for several days , for I hated the sight of the cabin and of all that was near to it .
Parsing [sent. 1435 len. 25]: The next day I acted upon this resolution , and slinging my dry provisions on my shoulder , I set off for the ravine .
Parsing [sent. 1436 len. 60]: In an hour I had gained it ; but not being in a hurry to cut wood , I resolved upon climbing higher up , to see if I could reach the opposite side of the island ; that is , at least , get over the brow of the hill , to have a good view of it .
Parsing [sent. 1437 len. 54]: I continued to climb until I had gained a smooth grassy spot , which was clear of brushwood ; and as I sat down to rest myself , I observed some blue flowers which I had never seen before , indeed I did not know that there was a flower on the island .
Parsing [sent. 1438 len. 14]: As I afterwards discovered , they were one of the varieties of Gentianellas .
Parsing [sent. 1439 len. 32]: I looked at them , admired them , and felt quite an affection for them ; they were very pretty , and they were , as well as myself , alone .
Parsing [sent. 1440 len. 103]: Jackson , when I was pointing out the English cottages in the landscapes of `` Mavor 's Natural History , '' had told me a great deal about gardening in England , and how wild flowers and trees were transplanted and improved by culture ; how roses and other plants were nailed up the walls , as I had observed in the engravings , and how they were watered and kept ; and as I sat down looking at the flower , the thought occurred to me , Why should I not take it with me , and keep it for myself ?
Parsing [sent. 1441 len. 11]: I can water it , and take care of it .
Parsing [sent. 1442 len. 19]: I resolved that I would do so , for I already looked upon the plant as a treasure .
Parsing [sent. 1443 len. 76]: I took it up carefully with my American knife , leaving sufficient mould about the roots , and then I proceeded to ascend the hill ; but before I had gone another hundred yards , I found at least a dozen more of these plants in flower , all finer than the one I had dug up , and three or four others very different from these , which were also quite new to me .
Parsing [sent. 1444 len. 28]: I was puzzled what to do ; I put down the plants I had dug up and continued my ascent , not having made up my mind .
Parsing [sent. 1445 len. 31]: After half-an-hour 's climbing , I gained the summit , and could perceive the ocean on the other side , and the other half of the island lying beneath me .
Parsing [sent. 1446 len. 65]: It was very grand from the height I stood on , but I observed little difference between one side of the island and the other ; all was rugged barren rock as on my side , with the exception of the portion close to me ; this had brushwood in the ravine , which appeared to be a sort of cleft through the island .
Parsing [sent. 1447 len. 23]: All was silent and solitary ; not a bird was to be seen , and nothing that had life could I discover .
Parsing [sent. 1448 len. 32]: I was about to return , when I thought I might as well go down the ravine facing me for a little way , and see what there was in it .
Parsing [sent. 1449 len. 21]: I did so , and discovered some other plants that I had not seen on my side of the island .
Parsing [sent. 1450 len. 42]: There were also some fern trees , and some twining plants running up them , and I thought to myself , Why , these plants are what I saw in the picture of the English cottages , or very like them .
Parsing [sent. 1451 len. 10]: I wonder if they would run up my cabin ?
Parsing [sent. 1452 len. 38]: and then all at once the idea came to me that I would plant some of them round the cabin , and that I would make a garden of flowers , and have plants of my own .
Parsing [sent. 1453 len. 29]: The reader can hardly imagine the pleasure that this idea gave me ; I sat down to ruminate upon it , and felt quite happy for the time .
Parsing [sent. 1454 len. 25]: I now recollected , however , that the cabin was built on the rock , and that plants would only grow in the earth .
Parsing [sent. 1455 len. 37]: At first this idea chilled me , as it seemed to destroy all my schemes , but I resolved that I would bring some earth to the rock , and make my garden in that way .
Parsing [sent. 1456 len. 35]: I at first thought of the guano , but Jackson had told me that it was only used in small proportions to enrich the soil , and would kill plants if used by itself .
Parsing [sent. 1457 len. 97]: After an hour 's consideration , during which I called to mind all that Jackson had told me on the subject , I made up my mind I would return to the cabin , and on my return ascertain how low down the ravine I could obtain earth for my garden ; I would then carry the earth to the cabin , make a soil ready for the plants and flowers , and then , when all was ready , I would go up the ravine , collect what I could , and make my garden .
Parsing [sent. 1458 len. 4]: I did so .
Parsing [sent. 1459 len. 70]: I found that I could get soil about one-third of the way up the ravine , a quarter of a mile below where the brushwood grew ; and having ascertained that , I returned to the cabin , threw down my provisions which were to have lasted me a week , and as it was late , I decided that I would not commence operations until the following day .
Parsing [sent. 1460 len. 42]: I took out of the chest a duck frock , and tying up the sleeves and collar , so as to form a bag of the body of the frock , I set off the next morning to begin my task .
Parsing [sent. 1461 len. 35]: That day I contrived to carry to the cabin ten or twelve bags of mould , which I put round it in a border about four feet wide , and about a foot deep .
Parsing [sent. 1462 len. 43]: It occupied me a whole week to obtain the quantity of earth necessary to make the bed on each side of the cabin ; it was hard work , but it made me cheerful and happy to what I had been before .
Parsing [sent. 1463 len. 28]: I found that the best cure for melancholy and solitude was employment , so I thus obtained valuable knowledge as well as the making of my garden .
Parsing [sent. 1464 len. 57]: When I had finished carrying the mould , I started off for the ravine with two bags to hold the plants which I might collect , and after a day 's toil , I returned with my bags full of small shrubs , besides a bundle of creepers to plant against the sides of the cabin .
Parsing [sent. 1465 len. 12]: The following day was occupied in planting everything I had procured .
Parsing [sent. 1466 len. 24]: I was sorry to see that the leaves and flowers hung down , but I watered them all before I went to bed .
Parsing [sent. 1467 len. 19]: The next morning I was delighted to perceive that they had all recovered and were looking quite fresh .
Parsing [sent. 1468 len. 44]: But my garden was not full enough to please me , and I once more went up the ravine , selecting other plants which had no flowers on them , and one or two other shrubs , which I had not before observed .
Parsing [sent. 1469 len. 75]: When these were planted and watered , my garden looked very gay and full of plants , and then I discovered the mould came down for want of support at the edges ; I therefore went and picked up pieces of rock of sufficient size to make a border and hold up the mould , and now all was complete , and I had nothing to do but to go on watering them daily .
Parsing [sent. 1470 len. 28]: This I did , and recollecting what Jackson had said about the guano , I got a bag of it , and put some to each plant .
Parsing [sent. 1471 len. 24]: The good effect of this was soon observable , and before the birds came , my garden was in a very flourishing condition .
Parsing [sent. 1472 len. 16]: I can not express to the reader the pleasure I derived from this little garden .
Parsing [sent. 1473 len. 41]: I knew every plant and every shrub , and talked to them as if they were companions , while I watered and tended them , which I did every night and morning , and their rapid growth was my delight .
Parsing [sent. 1474 len. 13]: I no longer felt my solitude so irksome as I had done .
Parsing [sent. 1475 len. 52]: I had something to look after , to interest me , and to love ; they were alive as well as I was ; they grew , and threw out leaves and flowers ; they were grateful for the care I bestowed upon them , and became my companions and friends .
Parsing [sent. 1476 len. 25]: I mentioned before that during the latter portion of the time I was with Jackson , he had taught me to sing several songs .
Parsing [sent. 1477 len. 36]: Feeling tired , in my solitude , of not hearing the human voice , I found myself at first humming over , and afterwards singing aloud , the various airs I had collected from him .
Parsing [sent. 1478 len. 15]: This afforded me much pleasure , and I used to sing half the day .
Parsing [sent. 1479 len. 43]: I had no one to listen to me , it is true , but as my fondness for my garden increased , I used to sit down and sing to the flowers and shrubs , and fancy that they listened to me .
Parsing [sent. 1480 len. 27]: But my stock of songs was not very large , and at last I had repeated them so often that I became tired of the words .
Parsing [sent. 1481 len. 22]: It occurred to me that the Prayer-book had the Psalms of David at the end of it , set to music .
Parsing [sent. 1482 len. 49]: I got the book , and as far as the airs that I knew would suit , I sang them all ; never were Psalms , probably , sung to such tunes before , but it amused me , and there was no want of variety of language .
Parsing [sent. 1483 len. 50]: Every three or four days I would go up the ravine , and search carefully for any new flower or shrub which I had not yet planted in my garden , and when I found one , as I often did , it was a source of great delight .
Parsing [sent. 1484 len. 31]: Chapter XV At last the birds came , and I procured some of their eggs , which were a very agreeable change , after living so long upon dried meat .
Parsing [sent. 1485 len. 49]: My want of occupation occasioned me also to employ some of my time in fishing , which I seldom had done while Jackson was alive ; and this created a variety in my food , to which , for a long while , I had been a stranger .
Parsing [sent. 1486 len. 30]: Jackson did not care for fish , as to cook it we were obliged to go up the ravine for wood , and he did not like the trouble .
Parsing [sent. 1487 len. 70]: When the birds came , I had recourse to my book on Natural History , to read over again the accounts of the Man-of-War birds , Gannets , and other birds mentioned in it ; and there was a vignette of a Chinaman with tame cormorants on a pole , and in the letter-press an account of how they were trained and employed to catch fish for their masters .
Parsing [sent. 1488 len. 49]: This gave me the idea that I would have some birds tame , as companions , and , if possible , teach them to catch fish for me ; but I knew that I must wait till the young birds were fit to be taken from the nest .
Parsing [sent. 1489 len. 30]: I now resolved that during the time the birds were mating , I would go to the ravine and remain there several days , to collect bundles of firewood .
Parsing [sent. 1490 len. 49]: The firewood was chiefly cut from a sort of low bush , like the sallow or willow , fit for making baskets , indeed fit for anything better than firewood ; however , there were some bushes which were of a harder texture , and which burnt well .
Parsing [sent. 1491 len. 35]: It was Jackson who told me that the former were called willow and used for making baskets , and he also shewed me how to tie the faggots up by twisting the sallows together .
Parsing [sent. 1492 len. 32]: They were not , however , what Jackson said they were -- from after knowledge , I should say that they were a species of Oleander or something of the kind .
Parsing [sent. 1493 len. 26]: Having roasted several dozen of eggs quite hard , by way of provision , I set off one morning , and went to the ravine .
Parsing [sent. 1494 len. 48]: As Jackson had said before , I had to walk under a wall of rock thirty feet high , and then pass through a water-course to get up to the ravine , which increased the distance to where the shrubs grew , at least half a mile .
Parsing [sent. 1495 len. 20]: It was over this wall that the captain fell and was killed , because Jackson would not assist him .
Parsing [sent. 1496 len. 73]: I gained the thicket where the bushes grew , and for three days I worked very hard , and had cut down and tied about fifty large faggots , when I thought that I had collected enough to last me for a long while ; but I had still to carry them down , and this was a heavy task , as I could not carry more than one at a time .
Parsing [sent. 1497 len. 57]: It occurred to me that if I threw my faggots over the wall opposite to where they had been cut down , I should save myself nearly a mile of carriage , as otherwise I had to walk all the way to the water-course which divided the wall of rock , and then walk back again .
Parsing [sent. 1498 len. 26]: Indeed , where I cut down the wood was not more than a quarter of a mile from the bathing-pool , and all down hill .
Parsing [sent. 1499 len. 24]: I was delighted at this idea , which I wondered had never occurred to Jackson , and I commenced putting it into execution .
Parsing [sent. 1500 len. 28]: The top of the wall of rock was slippery from the constant trickling of the water over the surface , but this was only in some places .
Parsing [sent. 1501 len. 25]: I carried my faggots down one by one , and threw them over , being careful not to lose my footing in so doing .
Parsing [sent. 1502 len. 55]: I had carried all but three or four , and had become careless , when , on heaving one over , my heels were thrown up , and before I could recover myself I slid down the remainder of the ledge and was precipitated down below , a distance of more than thirty feet .
Parsing [sent. 1503 len. 27]: I must have remained there many hours insensible , but at last I recovered and found myself lying on the faggots which I had thrown down .
Parsing [sent. 1504 len. 20]: It was my falling on the faggots , instead of the hard rock , which had saved my life .
Parsing [sent. 1505 len. 12]: I rose as soon as I could collect my scattered senses .
Parsing [sent. 1506 len. 26]: I felt very sore and very much shaken , and the blood was running out of my mouth , but there were no bones broken .
Parsing [sent. 1507 len. 14]: I was , however , too ill to attempt anything more that day .
Parsing [sent. 1508 len. 13]: I walked home at a very slow pace and went to bed .
Parsing [sent. 1509 len. 17]: A sound sleep restored me , and in a day or two I was quite recovered .
Parsing [sent. 1510 len. 62]: I watered my plants , which I found drooping , as if they had grieved at my being so long away from them , and then I returned to where my faggots had been left ; and to lighten my labour I resolved to carry them down to the bathing-pool and stack them up there on the rocks near to it .
Parsing [sent. 1511 len. 12]: I mention this for reasons that the reader will comprehend bye-and-bye .
Parsing [sent. 1512 len. 31]: This occupied me two days , for I was not inclined , after my fall , to work hard ; and very glad was I when the labour was over .
Parsing [sent. 1513 len. 24]: The young birds were now hatched , but I had to wait four or five weeks before they were fit to be taken .
Parsing [sent. 1514 len. 8]: I began again to find solitude tedious .
Parsing [sent. 1515 len. 21]: The flowers in my garden had all bloomed and withered , and there was not so much to interest me .
Parsing [sent. 1516 len. 20]: I recommenced reading the Bible , and the narratives in the Old and New Testaments again afforded me pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 1517 len. 29]: I hardly need say to the reader that I read the Bible as I would have read any other book -- for amusement , and not for instruction .
Parsing [sent. 1518 len. 27]: I had learnt little from Jackson -- indeed , as regards the true nature of the Christian religion , I may say , nothing at all .
Parsing [sent. 1519 len. 12]: I do not believe that he knew anything about it himself .
Parsing [sent. 1520 len. 37]: It is true that the precepts in the New Testament struck me , and that I was more interested about Our Saviour than anybody else ; but I could not comprehend him , or his mission .
Parsing [sent. 1521 len. 24]: In short , I read in darkness ; and I may say that I almost knew the Bible by heart without understanding it .
Parsing [sent. 1522 len. 5]: -- How could I ?
Parsing [sent. 1523 len. 20]: How many thousands are there who do the same , without having an excuse to offer for their blindness !
Parsing [sent. 1524 len. 23]: At last the time for taking the birds arrived , and I had then sufficient employment to keep me from being melancholy .
Parsing [sent. 1525 len. 30]: I collected quite as many as we had done when Jackson and I had to be provided for ; and with my new knives my labour was comparatively easy .
Parsing [sent. 1526 len. 28]: As soon as I had completed my provision , I went back to take the young birds which already I had selected and left for that purpose .
Parsing [sent. 1527 len. 21]: It was high time , for I found that when I went to take them they were ready to fly .
Parsing [sent. 1528 len. 77]: However , after a good battle with the old birds -LRB- for I had taken six young ones -- two from each nest , which arrayed a force of six old ones against me , who fought very valiantly in defence of their offspring -RRB- , I succeeded in carrying them off , but followed by the old birds , who now screamed and darted close to me as they came pursuing me to the cabin .
Parsing [sent. 1529 len. 58]: As soon as I got safe back , I took the young birds into the cabin , tying each of them by the leg with a piece of fishing line , and the other end of the line I fastened to some pieces of rock which I had collected ready on the platform outside of the cabin .
Parsing [sent. 1530 len. 36]: The old birds continued to persecute me till it was dark , and then they went away , and I , tired with my day 's labour , was not sorry to go to sleep .
Parsing [sent. 1531 len. 45]: When I woke up the next morning , I found the old birds on the platform , in company with the young ones , I presume trying to persuade them to fly away with them ; but the lines on their legs prevented that .
Parsing [sent. 1532 len. 51]: They did not leave at my approach for some little while ; at last they all took wing , and went off to sea ; but in the course of a few minutes they returned with some small fish in their mouths , with which they fed their young ones .
Parsing [sent. 1533 len. 45]: They continued to do this for the two following days , when there was a general break up , announcing the departure of the main body , which , after much soaring and wheeling in the air , flew off in a northerly direction .
Parsing [sent. 1534 len. 66]: The six parent birds , who were with their young ones at the cabin , appeared for some time very uneasy , flying round and round and screaming wildly ; at last they soared in the air with loud shrieks , and flew away after the main body , which was still in sight -- their love for their young overpowered by their instinctive habits .
Parsing [sent. 1535 len. 21]: I was not sorry when they were gone , as I wanted to have my new family all to myself .
Parsing [sent. 1536 len. 24]: I went down to the rocks and caught a fish , which was large enough to supply them for three or four days .
Parsing [sent. 1537 len. 17]: I fed them with the inside of the fish , and they ate it very heartily .
Parsing [sent. 1538 len. 37]: For several days they appeared very uneasy ; but gradually they settled , and not only appeared to know me , but to welcome my coming , which was to me a source of great pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 1539 len. 51]: I now neglected my flowers for the birds , which were the more animated of the two ; and I sat down for hours on the platform with my six companions , who I must own were not over-lively and intelligent , but they were alive , and had eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1540 len. 43]: They seldom roused up , unless I brought them fish , of which they had a supply four times a day , and then they would stand on their legs and open their beaks far apart , each waiting for its share .
Parsing [sent. 1541 len. 25]: They were a great happiness to me , and I watched their gradual increase of plumage and of size , which was very rapid .
Parsing [sent. 1542 len. 12]: I gave them all names out of my Natural History book .
Parsing [sent. 1543 len. 66]: One was Lion , then Tiger , Panther , Bear , Horse , and Jackass -LRB- at the time that I named them , the last would have been very appropriate to them all -RRB- ; and as I always called them by their names as I fed them , I soon found , to my great joy , that they knew them well enough .
Parsing [sent. 1544 len. 4]: This delighted me .
Parsing [sent. 1545 len. 68]: I read my books to them by way of amusement ; I sang my songs to them ; I talked to them ; I would even narrate the various histories out of the Bible to them , such as that of Joseph and his brethren , & c. , and the stolid air with which the communications were received made me almost imagine they were listened to .
Parsing [sent. 1546 len. 46]: After a time , I took the line off the legs of two of them , with the precaution of first cutting their wings , and these two became much more lively , following me into the cabin and generally staying there during the night .
Parsing [sent. 1547 len. 41]: As I found that no attempt was made to escape , I let them all loose , after having cut their wings , and they all behaved equally well with the two first to which I had given their liberty .
Parsing [sent. 1548 len. 29]: The perfect obedience and good behaviour of my new companions again gave me leisure that was not altogether desirable , as it left a vacuum to fill up .
Parsing [sent. 1549 len. 7]: But I returned to my garden .
Parsing [sent. 1550 len. 62]: I could do no more at present but water my plants and look at the increased daily growth of the climbers , as they now boldly ascended the sides of the cabin ; but I thought it was high time to go up into the ravine and about the island , to see if I could not add to my collection .
Parsing [sent. 1551 len. 9]: One morning I set off up the ravine .
Parsing [sent. 1552 len. 35]: I was not successful , so I contented myself with carrying , by the long road , those faggots which I had left behind me on the day when I fell over the precipice .
Parsing [sent. 1553 len. 43]: This labour I finished , and then returned to the cabin , where I was met by my birds with half-extended wings and open mouths , as if they were very glad to see me , and very hungry into the bargain .
Parsing [sent. 1554 len. 25]: I ought to observe that my birds appeared now to separate into pairs , male and female , as their difference of plumage denoted .
Parsing [sent. 1555 len. 20]: Lion and Horse were always side by side , as were Jackass and Bear , and Tiger and Panther .
Parsing [sent. 1556 len. 35]: I now fed them one by one , calling them by name , to which they immediately responded , and if anyone came who was not called , it was switched for its trouble .
Parsing [sent. 1557 len. 58]: The next morning I set off on another voyage of discovery after plants , and this time I resolved upon trying what I could find among the crevices of the rocks , for I had seen at a distance what appeared to me to be a very pretty flower on the ledge of one of the clefts .
Parsing [sent. 1558 len. 22]: I did not go up the ravine this time , but commenced climbing the rocks behind where the cabin was built .
Parsing [sent. 1559 len. 69]: It was hard work , but I was not easily discouraged , and after a couple of hours I arrived at a level which I had in view when I commenced my labour , and here I was amply rewarded , for I found several plants quite new to me , and a variety of ferns , which I thought very beautiful , although they had no flowers .
Parsing [sent. 1560 len. 13]: The scene , from where I stood , was awful and beautiful .
Parsing [sent. 1561 len. 32]: I looked down upon the rocks below , and the cabin , which appeared very small , and I thought that I could see my birds like dots upon the platform .
Parsing [sent. 1562 len. 41]: It was a bright day and smooth water , I could clearly distinguish the other islands in the distance , and I thought that I saw something like a white speck close to them -- perhaps it was a vessel .
Parsing [sent. 1563 len. 40]: This made me melancholy , and I could not help asking myself whether I was to remain all my life upon the island , alone , or if there were any chance of my ever being taken off it .
Parsing [sent. 1564 len. 38]: As I looked down upon the cabin , I was surprised at the steepness of the rocks which I had climbed , and felt alarmed , as if I never should be able to get back again .
Parsing [sent. 1565 len. 8]: But these thoughts were soon chased away .
Parsing [sent. 1566 len. 10]: I turned from the seaward , and looked inland .
Parsing [sent. 1567 len. 46]: I found that on one side of me there was a chasm between the rocks , the bottom of which was so far down that I could not see it ; and on the other side the rock rose up as straight as a wall .
Parsing [sent. 1568 len. 22]: My attention was soon diverted by discovering another plant , and I now commenced my task of digging them all up .
Parsing [sent. 1569 len. 41]: I obtained , with the ferns , about twenty new varieties , which I made up in a bundle ready for carrying down slung round my neck , for I knew that I should require both hands to descend with .
Parsing [sent. 1570 len. 37]: Then I sat down to rest myself a little before I commenced my return , and after I had been seated a few minutes , I thought I would sing a song by way of amusement .
Parsing [sent. 1571 len. 74]: Chapter XVI I have before said that , tired of repeating the words of the songs which Jackson had taught me , I had taken those of Psalms in metre , at the end of the Prayer-book , by way of variety ; and , as far as metre went , they answered very well , although people would have been surprised to have heard Psalms sung to such quick and varied measure .
Parsing [sent. 1572 len. 56]: The Psalm I chose this time was the first -- `` How blest is he who ne'er consents ; '' and I began accordingly ; but when I came to the end of the line , to my astonishment I heard a plaintive voice , at a distance , repeat after me `` con-sents . ''
Parsing [sent. 1573 len. 4]: I looked round .
Parsing [sent. 1574 len. 20]: I thought I must have been deceived , so I continued -- `` By ill advice to walk . ''
Parsing [sent. 1575 len. 23]: This time I could not be mistaken -- `` to walk '' was repeated by the same voice as plainly as possible .
Parsing [sent. 1576 len. 8]: I stopped singing , lost in wonder .
Parsing [sent. 1577 len. 43]: There must be somebody on the island as well as myself , thought I ; for I never had heard an echo before , except when it thundered , and such echoes I had put down as a portion of the thunder .
Parsing [sent. 1578 len. 6]: `` Who 's there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1579 len. 8]: cried I. `` Who 's there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1580 len. 4]: replied the voice .
Parsing [sent. 1581 len. 6]: `` It 's me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1582 len. 6]: `` It 's me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1583 len. 4]: was the answer .
Parsing [sent. 1584 len. 10]: I did not know what to make of it .
Parsing [sent. 1585 len. 25]: I cried out again and again , and again and again I heard what I said repeated , but no answer to my questions .
Parsing [sent. 1586 len. 45]: I thought I was insulted by somebody , and yet , when I listened , the voice that spoke came from the face of the rock on the other side of the chasm , and no one could be there without my seeing them .
Parsing [sent. 1587 len. 26]: This made me think that I was mistaken , and that there could not be anybody , but still I could not solve the mystery .
Parsing [sent. 1588 len. 23]: At last I became frightened , and as the sun was now setting , I determined to get back to the cabin .
Parsing [sent. 1589 len. 26]: I did so , and went down much faster than I had gone up , for as it grew dark I became the more alarmed .
Parsing [sent. 1590 len. 32]: The only thing that re-assured me was the softness and plaintiveness of the voice -- not like Jackson 's , but as of someone who would not think of injuring me .
Parsing [sent. 1591 len. 29]: Although I was , generally speaking , quiet and content with my isolated position , yet it was only when I was employed or amused with my favourites .
Parsing [sent. 1592 len. 17]: At times , I could not find anything to do , and was overcome by weariness .
Parsing [sent. 1593 len. 41]: I would then throw away my books , and remain for hours thinking upon the probability of my ever again seeing a fellow creature ; and a fit of melancholy would come over me , which would last many days .
Parsing [sent. 1594 len. 60]: I was in one of these moods , when it occurred to me , that , although I had seen the other side of the island from the summit , I had not gone down to the beach to explore it ; and I resolved that I would do so , making a trip of three or four days .
Parsing [sent. 1595 len. 32]: When my knives had become blunt , Jackson had told me how to sharpen them , by rubbing the blades upon a hard flat piece of rock , wetted with water .
Parsing [sent. 1596 len. 66]: This I had found to answer very well , and I now determined I would try and sharpen one of the old axes in the same way , so as to make it serviceable , for I was very much afraid of breaking my knives in cutting down the brushwood , and I knew how much more rapidly it could be done with an axe .
Parsing [sent. 1597 len. 28]: I picked out a large stone , suitable for the purpose , and with a kid of water at hand , I set-to to sharpen the axe .
Parsing [sent. 1598 len. 25]: It was a long job , but in a day or two I had succeeded admirably , and the axe was in good order .
Parsing [sent. 1599 len. 20]: I then thought how I could leave my birds for so many days , as they would require food .
Parsing [sent. 1600 len. 25]: At last , I considered that if I caught two large fish and cut them up , they would be sufficient for their sustenance .
Parsing [sent. 1601 len. 84]: I did so , and provided with a packet of dried birds for food , tied up in a duck frock , with my Natural History book for amusement , a pannikin to get water in , my axe on my shoulder , and my knives by my side -- I first kissed all the birds , and told them to remain quiet and good till I came back -- I set off on a bright clear morning on my tour of examination .
Parsing [sent. 1602 len. 28]: In a couple of hours I had gained the summit of the island , and prepared for my descent , by sitting down and eating my dinner .
Parsing [sent. 1603 len. 32]: I observed that , as before , the water on the other side of the island was quite smooth , compared to what it was on the side where I resided .
Parsing [sent. 1604 len. 21]: It was , in fact , from the prevailing winds during the year , the lee side of the island .
Parsing [sent. 1605 len. 28]: Having rested myself sufficiently , I commenced my descent , which I accomplished in little less time than it took me to ascend from the other side .
Parsing [sent. 1606 len. 20]: As I neared the rocks by the shore , I thought I perceived something occasionally moving about on them .
Parsing [sent. 1607 len. 34]: I was not mistaken , for as I came closer , I found that there were several large animals lying on the rocks , and occasionally dropping into the sea close to them .
Parsing [sent. 1608 len. 12]: The sight of anything living was to me of great interest .
Parsing [sent. 1609 len. 13]: I determined to get nearer , and ascertain what animals they were .
Parsing [sent. 1610 len. 20]: At last , by creeping along from rock to rock , I arrived to within forty yards of them .
Parsing [sent. 1611 len. 58]: I recollected some animals of the same shape in my book of Natural History , which , fortunately , I had with me in the duck frock , and sitting down behind the rock , I pulled it out , and turned over the pages until I came to a print which exactly answered to their appearance .
Parsing [sent. 1612 len. 5]: It was the Seal .
Parsing [sent. 1613 len. 43]: Having satisfied myself on that point , I read the history of the animal , and found that it was easily tamed , and very affectionate when taken young , and also might be easily killed by a blow on the nose .
Parsing [sent. 1614 len. 16]: These , at least , were for me the two most important pieces of information .
Parsing [sent. 1615 len. 42]: It occurred to me that it would be very pleasant to have a young seal for a playmate -LRB- for the Gannets , after all , were not very intelligent -RRB- , and I resolved to obtain one if I could .
Parsing [sent. 1616 len. 30]: I put down my duck frock with my provisions behind the rock , and taking my axe in my hand , I cautiously advanced to where the animals lay .
Parsing [sent. 1617 len. 29]: There were about twenty of them all together on one rock , but they were all large , and seemed to be about five or six feet long .
Parsing [sent. 1618 len. 34]: I could not see a small one anywhere , so I walked in behind the rocks farther to the right , towards another rock , where I saw another batch of them lying .
Parsing [sent. 1619 len. 26]: As I neared them , I saw by herself a seal with a young one by her side , not more than two feet long .
Parsing [sent. 1620 len. 6]: This was what I wanted .
Parsing [sent. 1621 len. 14]: They lay at some distance from the water , upon a low rock .
Parsing [sent. 1622 len. 24]: I watched them for some time , and was much amused at the prattling which passed between the old and the young one .
Parsing [sent. 1623 len. 27]: I thought that to obtain the young one , I must of course kill the old one , for I perceived that it had large teeth .
Parsing [sent. 1624 len. 31]: I considered it advisable to get between them and the water , that they might not escape me , and I contrived so to do before I made my appearance .
Parsing [sent. 1625 len. 73]: As soon as the old one perceived me running to them , it gave a shrill cry , and then floundered towards the water ; as we came close together , it showed its teeth , and rose upon its flappers to defend itself and its young one , which kept close to its side ; but a blow on its nose with the axe rendered it motionless , and apparently dead .
Parsing [sent. 1626 len. 51]: Delighted with my success , I seized hold of the young one and took it in my arms , and was carrying it away , when I found myself confronted with the male seal , which , alarmed by the cry of the female , had come to her assistance .
Parsing [sent. 1627 len. 23]: It was much larger than the female , with more shaggy hair about the neck and shoulders , and apparently very fierce .
Parsing [sent. 1628 len. 40]: I could not pass it , as it was in shore of me , and I had just time to drop the young seal , and leap behind a rock on one side , with my axe all ready .
Parsing [sent. 1629 len. 28]: The animal reared itself on the rock to pass over to me , when I saluted it with a blow on the head , which staggered it .
Parsing [sent. 1630 len. 46]: I had lost my presence of mind by the creature coming upon me so unexpectedly , and my blow was not well aimed , but before it could recover the first blow , another on its nose tumbled it over , to all appearance lifeless .
Parsing [sent. 1631 len. 37]: I then hastened to gain the other side of the rock , where I had left the young seal , and found that it had crept to its mother 's body , and was fondling it .
Parsing [sent. 1632 len. 43]: I took it in my arms , and retreated to where I had left my duck frock , and throwing everything else out , I put the animal in , and tied up the end , so that it could not escape .
Parsing [sent. 1633 len. 28]: I then sat down to recover myself from the excitement occasioned by this first engagement I had ever been in , quite delighted with my newly-acquired treasure .
Parsing [sent. 1634 len. 8]: I then thought what I should do .
Parsing [sent. 1635 len. 40]: It was now within an hour of dark , and was too late to return to the other side of the island , or I would have done so , as I was anxious to get my seal home .
Parsing [sent. 1636 len. 22]: At last I decided that I would go farther from the beach , and take up my quarters for the night .
Parsing [sent. 1637 len. 68]: I collected my provision , and with my seal under my arm , I walked away about one hundred yards from the water 's edge , and took up a position under a large rock ; here I ate my supper , and then untied the line which closed up the frock , and had a parting look at my little friend before I went to sleep .
Parsing [sent. 1638 len. 23]: He had struggled a good deal at first , but was now quiet , although he occasionally made attempts to bite me .
Parsing [sent. 1639 len. 53]: I coaxed him and fondled him a good deal , and then put him into his bag again , and made him secure , which appeared to annoy him very much , as he was not half as quiet in a bag as he was when I held him in my lap .
Parsing [sent. 1640 len. 57]: I then took my book to read over again the history of the seal , and I found that their skins were valuable , and also that they gave a great deal of oil , but I had no use for oil , though I thought that their skins might be very comfortable in my bed-place .
Parsing [sent. 1641 len. 34]: I shut my book and lay down to sleep , but I could not obtain any till near daylight , I had been so excited , and was so anxious about my treasure .
Parsing [sent. 1642 len. 42]: The sun shining in my eyes woke me up ; I found my seal was lying very quiet ; I touched him to see that he was not dead , and the cry that he gave assured me to the contrary .
Parsing [sent. 1643 len. 15]: I then walked back to where I had left the bodies of the parents .
Parsing [sent. 1644 len. 29]: I found on examination that they were both dead , and also that their furs were very beautiful , and I resolved that I would have their skins .
Parsing [sent. 1645 len. 6]: But here was a difficulty .
Parsing [sent. 1646 len. 62]: If I took off the skins , I could not carry them with me , and I was anxious to get the young one home , lest it should die of hunger , so I decided that I would first take home the young one , give it food and warm it , and then return and skin the old ones .
Parsing [sent. 1647 len. 53]: I therefore made my breakfast , and leaving the remainder of my provision in a cleft in the rock , that I might not have the trouble of bringing it again , I set off on my return , and used such diligence that I was back at the cabin by noon .
Parsing [sent. 1648 len. 39]: I found my birds all well , and apparently quite satisfied with the provision that I had left them , for they were most of them asleep , and those that were awake did not notice my arrival .
Parsing [sent. 1649 len. 48]: `` Ah , '' thought I , `` you only like me for what I give you ; next time I go away I will leave you hungry , and then when you see me come back , you will all flutter your wings with gladness . ''
Parsing [sent. 1650 len. 31]: I was puzzled where to put my seal so as to keep him safe : at last I decided upon opening the seaman 's chest and putting him in that .
Parsing [sent. 1651 len. 18]: I did so , and gave him a piece of fish which the birds had not eaten .
Parsing [sent. 1652 len. 24]: The little creature devoured it eagerly , and I took my lines and went down to catch some fish for a further supply .
Parsing [sent. 1653 len. 26]: In half an hour I returned with two large fish , and I then took the seal out of the chest and fed him again .
Parsing [sent. 1654 len. 18]: He ate very heartily ; and I was glad to perceive that he appeared much tamer already .
Parsing [sent. 1655 len. 24]: I threw some of the insides of the fish to the birds , who were now become of very inferior interest to me .
Parsing [sent. 1656 len. 94]: Having fed my animals , I then thought of myself , and , as I took my meal , I arranged that the next morning I would go over to the other side of the island , skin the two seals , and spread out the skins on the rocks to dry , and would leave them there till I had a better opportunity of bringing them to the cabin ; at present I could not be away from my new acquaintance , which I wished to make tame and fond of me .
Parsing [sent. 1657 len. 28]: Having fed him again in the morning , I put down the lid of the chest , and then started for the lee side of the island .
Parsing [sent. 1658 len. 45]: Chapter XVII I arrived early , skinned both the seals , and dragged the skins up from the water-side , though with difficulty , especially that of the large one , to the rock where I had taken up my quarters the night before .
Parsing [sent. 1659 len. 25]: Here I spread them out to dry , putting large pieces of rock upon the edges , that they might not be blown away .
Parsing [sent. 1660 len. 47]: It was nearly dusk when I had finished , but I set off , and an hour after dark arrived at the cabin ; for now that I knew my way so well , I got over the ground twice as fast as I did before .
Parsing [sent. 1661 len. 16]: I crawled into my bed-place in the dark , and slept soundly after my fatigue .
Parsing [sent. 1662 len. 28]: I awoke the next morning with the plaintive cry of my seal in the chest , and I hastened to get some fish to feed him with .
Parsing [sent. 1663 len. 20]: I took him out and fed him ; and was astonished how tame the little animal had become already .
Parsing [sent. 1664 len. 40]: He remained very quietly with me after he had been fed , nestling close to my side , as if I had been his mother , and even making a half attempt to follow me when I left him .
Parsing [sent. 1665 len. 37]: My birds appeared very dull and stupid , and I observed also that they were very dirty , and always rushed to the kid when it was full of water , trying to get into it .
Parsing [sent. 1666 len. 34]: This made me think that they required bathing in salt water , and I took one down to the bathing-pool , with a long line to its leg , and put it in .
Parsing [sent. 1667 len. 85]: The manner in which the poor creature floundered , and dipped and washed itself , for several minutes , proved my supposition correct ; so , after allowing it half an hour for its recreation , I took it back , and went down with the others until they had all indulged in the luxury of a bath ; and from that time , as I took them down almost every day , it was astonishing how much brighter and sleeker their plumage became .
Parsing [sent. 1668 len. 46]: I remained a week in the cabin , taming my seal , which now was quite fond of me ; and one night , as I was going to bed , he crawled into my bed-place , and from that time he was my bed-fellow .
Parsing [sent. 1669 len. 29]: At the end of a week I went over to the other side of the island , and contrived to carry up the two skins to the summit .
Parsing [sent. 1670 len. 8]: It was a hard day 's work .
Parsing [sent. 1671 len. 52]: The day afterwards I conveyed them to the cabin , and , as they were quite dry , I put them into my bed-place to lie down upon , as I did not like the smell of the birds ' feathers , although I had so long been accustomed to them .
Parsing [sent. 1672 len. 46]: And now , what with my seal , my birds , and my garden , and the occupation they gave me , the time passed quickly away , until , by my reckoning , it was nearly the period for the birds to come again .
Parsing [sent. 1673 len. 15]: I observed , as the time drew near , that my birds were uneasy .
Parsing [sent. 1674 len. 32]: They had paired , as I mentioned before , and when their plumage was complete , it was evident that they had paired male and female , as I had supposed .
Parsing [sent. 1675 len. 26]: They had not been tethered for a long while , and appeared to me now very much inclined to fly , especially the male birds .
Parsing [sent. 1676 len. 62]: At first I thought that I would cut all their wings , as I was fearful that they would join the other birds on their arrival , but observing that they were so fond of their mates , I resolved to cut the wing of the females only , as I did not think that the male birds would leave them .
Parsing [sent. 1677 len. 31]: I did so , and took my chance ; for since I had the seal for a companion , I did not care so much for the birds as before .
Parsing [sent. 1678 len. 52]: At last the birds came , and took possession of the guano-ground as usual , and I went for fresh eggs ; at the same time I found that my females were scratching , as if they would make their nests , and a few days afterwards they began to lay .
Parsing [sent. 1679 len. 74]: I then thought that as soon as they had young ones they would wish to go away , so I took the eggs that were laid , to prevent them , but I found that as fast as I took away the eggs they laid more , and this they did for nearly two months , supplying me with fresh eggs long after the wild birds had hatched , and left the island .
Parsing [sent. 1680 len. 32]: The male birds , at the time that the females first laid their eggs , tried their wings in short flights in circles , and then flew away out to sea .
Parsing [sent. 1681 len. 39]: I thought that they were gone , but I was deceived , for they returned in about a quarter of an hour , each with a fish in its beak , which they laid down before their mates .
Parsing [sent. 1682 len. 66]: I was much pleased at this , and I resolved that in future they should supply their own food , which they did ; and not their own food only , but enough for the seal and me also when the weather was fine , but when it was rough , they could not obtain any , and then I was obliged to feed them .
Parsing [sent. 1683 len. 52]: The way I obtained from them the extra supply of fish was , that when they first went out , I seized , on their return , the fish which they brought , and as often as I did this they would go for more , until the females were fed .
Parsing [sent. 1684 len. 44]: But I had one difficulty to contend with , which was , that at the time the birds could not obtain fish , which was when the weather was rough , I could not either , as they would not take the bait .
Parsing [sent. 1685 len. 68]: After some cogitation , I decided that I would divide a portion of the bathing-pool farthest from the shore , by a wall of loose rock which the water could flow through , but which the fish could not get out of , and that I would catch fish in the fine weather to feed the seal and the birds when the weather was rough and bad .
Parsing [sent. 1686 len. 58]: As soon as I had finished curing my stock of provisions and got it safely housed in the cabin , I set to work to make this wall , which did not take me a very long while , as the water was not more than two feet deep , and the pool about ten yards across .
Parsing [sent. 1687 len. 40]: As soon as it was finished , I went out every day , when it was fine , and caught as many fish as I thought I might require , and put them into this portion of the bathing-pool .
Parsing [sent. 1688 len. 34]: I found the plan answer well , as the fish lived , but I had great difficulty in getting them out when I wanted them , for they would not take the bait .
Parsing [sent. 1689 len. 30]: As my birds were no longer a trouble to me , but rather , on the contrary , a profit , I devoted my whole time to my seal .
Parsing [sent. 1690 len. 51]: I required a name for him , and reading in the book of Natural History that a certain lion was called Nero , I thought it a very good name for a seal , and bestowed it on him accordingly , although what Nero meant I had no idea of .
Parsing [sent. 1691 len. 59]: The animal was now so tame that he would cry if ever I left him , and would follow me as far as he could down the rocks , but there was one part of the path leading to the bathing-pool which was too difficult for him , and there he would remain crying till I came back .
Parsing [sent. 1692 len. 24]: I had more than once taken him down to the bathing-pool to wash him , and he was much pleased when I did .
Parsing [sent. 1693 len. 41]: I now resolved that I would clear the path of the rocks , that he might be able to follow me down the whole way , for he had grown so much that I found him too heavy to carry .
Parsing [sent. 1694 len. 49]: It occupied me a week before I could roll away and remove the smaller rocks , and knock off others with the axe , but I finished it at last , and was pleased to find that the animal followed me right down and plunged into the water .
Parsing [sent. 1695 len. 44]: He had not been down since I had made the wall of rock to keep the fish in , and as soon as he was in , he dived and came out with one of the fish , which he brought to land .
Parsing [sent. 1696 len. 31]: `` So now , '' thought I , `` I shall know how to get the fish when I want them -- I shall bring you down , Nero . ''
Parsing [sent. 1697 len. 18]: I may as well here observe that Nero very soon obeyed orders as faithfully as a dog .
Parsing [sent. 1698 len. 23]: I had a little switch , and when he did wrong , I would give him a slight tap on the nose .
Parsing [sent. 1699 len. 20]: He would shake his head , show his teeth , and growl , and then come fondly to me .
Parsing [sent. 1700 len. 36]: As he used to follow me every day down to the pool , I had to break him off going after the fish when I did not want them taken , and this I accomplished .
Parsing [sent. 1701 len. 26]: No one who had not witnessed it , could imagine the affection and docility of this animal , and the love I had for him .
Parsing [sent. 1702 len. 16]: He was my companion and playmate during the day , and my bedfellow at night .
Parsing [sent. 1703 len. 4]: We were inseparable .
Parsing [sent. 1704 len. 24]: It was at the latter portion of the second year of my solitude that a circumstance occurred , that I must now relate .
Parsing [sent. 1705 len. 43]: Nero had gone down to the pool with me , and I was standing fishing off the rocks , when he came out of the pool and plunged into the sea , playing all sorts of gambols , and whistling with delight .
Parsing [sent. 1706 len. 8]: I did not think anything about it .
Parsing [sent. 1707 len. 34]: He plunged and disappeared for a few minutes , and then would come up again close to where my line was , but he disturbed the fish and I could not catch any .
Parsing [sent. 1708 len. 27]: To drive him farther off , I pelted him with pieces of rock , one of which hit him very hard , and he dived down .
Parsing [sent. 1709 len. 59]: After a time I pulled up my line , and whistling to him to return , although I did not see him , I went away to the cabin , fully expecting that he would soon follow me , for now he could walk -LRB- after his fashion -RRB- from the cabin to the pool as he pleased .
Parsing [sent. 1710 len. 55]: This was early in the morning , and I busied myself with my garden , which was now in great luxuriance , for I had dressed it with guano ; but observing about noon that he had not returned , I became uneasy , and went down to the pool to look for him .
Parsing [sent. 1711 len. 19]: He was not there , and I looked on the sea , but could not perceive him anywhere .
Parsing [sent. 1712 len. 28]: I called and whistled , but it was of no use , and I grew very much alarmed at the idea that my treasure had deserted me .
Parsing [sent. 1713 len. 29]: `` It could not be because I threw the pieces of rock at him , '' thought I ; `` he would not leave me for that . ''
Parsing [sent. 1714 len. 65]: I remained for two or three hours , watching for him , but it was all in vain ; there was no seal -- no Nero , -- my heart sank at the idea of the animal having deserted me , and for the first time in my life , as far as I can recollect , I burst into a flood of tears .
Parsing [sent. 1715 len. 48]: For the first time in my life , I may say , I felt truly miserable -- my whole heart and affections were set upon this animal , the companion and friend of my solitude , and I felt as if existence were a burden without him .
Parsing [sent. 1716 len. 24]: After a while , I retraced my steps to the cabin , but I was miserable , more so than I can express .
Parsing [sent. 1717 len. 6]: I could not rest quiet .
Parsing [sent. 1718 len. 20]: Two hours before sunset , I went down again to the rocks , and called till I was hoarse .
Parsing [sent. 1719 len. 29]: It was all in vain ; night closed in , and again I returned to the cabin , and threw myself down in my bed-place in utter despair .
Parsing [sent. 1720 len. 32]: `` I thought he loved me , '' said I to myself , `` loved me as I loved him ; I would not have left him in that way . ''
Parsing [sent. 1721 len. 19]: And my tears burst out anew at the idea that I never should see my poor Nero again .
Parsing [sent. 1722 len. 79]: The reader may think that my grief was inordinate and unwarrantable , but let him put himself in my position -- a lad of sixteen , alone on a desolate island , with only one companion -- true , he was an animal , and could not speak , but he was affectionate ; he replied to all my caresses ; he was my only companion and friend , the only object that I loved or cared about .
Parsing [sent. 1723 len. 38]: He was intelligent , and I thought loved me as much as I loved him , and now he had deserted me , and I had nothing else that I cared about or that cared for me .
Parsing [sent. 1724 len. 19]: My tears flowed for more than an hour , till at last I was wearied and fell asleep .
Parsing [sent. 1725 len. 20]: Chapter XVIII It was early in the morning , and yet dark , when I felt something touch me .
Parsing [sent. 1726 len. 24]: I started up -- a low cry of pleasure told me at once that it was Nero , who was by my side .
Parsing [sent. 1727 len. 28]: Yes , it was Nero , who had come back , having climbed up again the steep path to the cabin , to return to his master .
Parsing [sent. 1728 len. 43]: Need I say that I was overjoyed , that I hugged him as if he had been a human being , that I wept over him , and that in a few minutes afterwards we were asleep together in the same bed-place .
Parsing [sent. 1729 len. 23]: Such was the fact , and never was there in my after life , so great a transition from grief to joy .
Parsing [sent. 1730 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 1731 len. 42]: now , if you had left me , '' -- said I to him , the next morning , when I got up ; `` you naughty seal , to frighten me and make me so unhappy as you did ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1732 len. 19]: Nero appeared quite as happy as I was at our reunion , and was more affectionate than ever .
Parsing [sent. 1733 len. 37]: I must now pass over many months in very few words , just stating to the reader what my position was at the end of three years , during which I was alone upon the island .
Parsing [sent. 1734 len. 20]: I had now arrived at the age of near seventeen , and was tall and strong for my years .
Parsing [sent. 1735 len. 30]: I had left off wearing my dress of the skins of birds , having substituted one of the seaman 's shirts , which I had found in the chest .
Parsing [sent. 1736 len. 54]: This , however , was the whole of my costume , and although , had it been longer it would have been more correct , still , as I had no other companion but Nero , it was not necessary to be so very particular , as if I had been in society .
Parsing [sent. 1737 len. 76]: During these three years , I think I had read the Bible and Prayer-book , and my Natural History book , at least five or six times quite through , and possessing a retentive memory , could almost repeat them by heart ; but still I read the Bible as a sealed book , for I did not understand it , having had no one to instruct me , nor any grace bestowed upon me .
Parsing [sent. 1738 len. 9]: I read for amusement , and nothing more .
Parsing [sent. 1739 len. 46]: My garden was now in a most flourishing condition , the climbing plants had overrun the cabin , so as to completely cover the whole of the roof and every portion of it , and they hung in festoons on each side of the door-way .
Parsing [sent. 1740 len. 54]: Many of the plants which I had taken up small , when I moved them , had proved to be trees , and were now waving to the breeze , high above the cabin roof ; and everything that I had planted , from continual watering and guano , had grown most luxuriantly .
Parsing [sent. 1741 len. 45]: In fact , my cabin was so covered and sheltered , that its original form had totally disappeared , it now looked like an arbour in a clump of trees , and from the rocks by the bathing-pool it had a very picturesque appearance .
Parsing [sent. 1742 len. 71]: I had , of course , several times gone up the ravine , and now that my axe had become useful , I had gradually accumulated a large stock of wood down by the bathing-pool , more than I could use for a long while , as I seldom lighted a fire , but the cutting it was employment , and employment was to me a great source of happiness .
Parsing [sent. 1743 len. 41]: I had been several times to the other side of the island , and had had more encounters with the seals , of which I killed many , for I found their skins very comfortable and useful in the cabin .
Parsing [sent. 1744 len. 64]: I had collected about three dozen of the finest skins , which were more than I required , but I had taken them for the same reason that I had collected the firewood , for the sake of employment , and in this instance , I may add , for the sake of the excitement which the combats with the seals afforded me .
Parsing [sent. 1745 len. 42]: I have not narrated any of these conflicts , as I thought that they might weary the reader , I must , however , state what occurred on one occasion , as although ludicrous , it nearly cost me my life .
Parsing [sent. 1746 len. 24]: I had attacked a large male seal , with a splendid fur , for I always looked out for the best skinned animals .
Parsing [sent. 1747 len. 79]: He was lying on a rock close to the water , and I had gone into the water to cut him off and prevent his escape by plunging in , as he would otherwise have done ; but as I aimed the usual blow at his nose , my foot slipped on the wet rock , and I missed the animal , and at the same time fell down on the rock with the axe in my hand .
Parsing [sent. 1748 len. 43]: The animal , which was a male of the largest size , seized hold of my shirt -LRB- which I then wore -RRB- with his teeth , and , plunging with me into the sea , dived down into the deep water .
Parsing [sent. 1749 len. 22]: It was fortunate that he had seized my shirt instead of my body , and also that I could swim well .
Parsing [sent. 1750 len. 54]: He carried me along with him -- the shirt , for a few seconds , drawn over my head , when , disembarrassing myself of the garment , by slipping my head and arms out , I left it in his possession , and regained the surface of the water , almost suffocated .
Parsing [sent. 1751 len. 27]: It was fortunate that I did not wear sleeve-buttons ; had I had them , I could not have disengaged myself , and must have perished .
Parsing [sent. 1752 len. 25]: I climbed the rock again , and turning round , I perceived the seal on the surface , shaking the shirt in great wrath .
Parsing [sent. 1753 len. 45]: This was a sad discomfiture , as I lost not only my shirt but my axe , which I dropped when I was dragged into the water ; nothing was saved except my knife , which I carried by a lanyard round my neck .
Parsing [sent. 1754 len. 95]: Why I mention this circumstance particularly , is , that having felt great inconvenience for want of sleeve-buttons to hold the wristbands of my shirt together , I had thought of making use of those of the mate , which the reader may recollect had been given with his watch into Jackson 's care , to take home to his wife ; but on second consideration I thought it very possible I might lose them , and decided that the property was in trust , and that I had no right to risk it .
Parsing [sent. 1755 len. 17]: This correct feeling on my part , therefore , was probably the saving of my life .
Parsing [sent. 1756 len. 89]: I have only now to mention my birds , and of them I can merely say that they went on as before ; they bathed constantly , at the right season they laid eggs , the male birds caught fish and brought them to the cabin , and they were just as stupid and uninteresting as they were at first ; however , they never left me , nor indeed shewed any intention to leave me , after the first season of the birds returning to the island .
Parsing [sent. 1757 len. 24]: They were useful but not very ornamental , and not at all interesting to one who had such an intelligent companion as Nero .
Parsing [sent. 1758 len. 34]: Having now brought up my history , in a few words , until the time referred to , I come to the narrative of what occurred to produce a change in my condition .
Parsing [sent. 1759 len. 24]: I have said that in the chest there was a spy-glass , but it had been wetted with salt-water , and was useless .
Parsing [sent. 1760 len. 31]: Jackson had tried to shew me how to use it , and had shewn me correctly , but the glasses were dimmed by the wet and subsequent evaporation from heat .
Parsing [sent. 1761 len. 72]: I had taken out all the glasses and cleaned them , except the field-glass as it is called , but that being composed of two glasses , the water had penetrated between them , and it still remained so dull that nothing could be distinguished through it , at the time that Jackson was shewing me how to use the instrument ; it was therefore put on one side as useless .
Parsing [sent. 1762 len. 54]: A year afterwards , I took it out , from curiosity , and then I discovered that the moisture between the two glasses had been quite dried up , and that I could see very clearly through it , and after a little practice I could use it as well as anybody else .
Parsing [sent. 1763 len. 41]: Still I seldom did use it , as my eyesight was particularly keen , and I did not require it , and as for any vessel coming off the island , I had gradually given up all thoughts of it .
Parsing [sent. 1764 len. 32]: It was one evening when the weather was very rough and the sea much agitated , that I thought I saw something unusual on the water , about four miles distant .
Parsing [sent. 1765 len. 103]: I supposed at first it might be a spermaceti whale , for numbers used to play round the island at certain seasons , and I used to watch their blowing and their gambols , if I may use the term , and Jackson often told me long stories about the whale fisheries ; but a ray of the setting sun made the object appear white , and I ran for the glass , and made out that it was a boat or a very small vessel , with a sail out , and running before the gale right down to the island .
Parsing [sent. 1766 len. 33]: I watched it till it was dark with much interest , and with thoughts of various kinds chasing each other ; and then I began to consider what was best to do .
Parsing [sent. 1767 len. 37]: I knew that in an hour the moon would rise , and as the sky was not cloudy , although the wind and sea were high , I should probably be able to see it again .
Parsing [sent. 1768 len. 25]: `` But they never can get on shore on this side of the island , '' thought I , `` with so much sea .
Parsing [sent. 1769 len. 12]: Yes they might , if they ran for the bathing-pool . ''
Parsing [sent. 1770 len. 46]: After thinking a while , I decided that I would go down to the bathing-pool , and place lighted faggots on the rocks on each side of the entrance , as this would shew them where to run for , and how to get in .
Parsing [sent. 1771 len. 74]: I waited a little longer , and then taking my spy-glass and some tinder with me , I went down to the pool , carried two faggots to the rocks on each side , and having set them on fire and taken up others to replace them as soon as they were burnt out , I sat down with my spy-glass to see if I could make out where the boat might be .
Parsing [sent. 1772 len. 30]: As the moon rose , I descried her now within a mile of the island , and her head directed towards the beacon lights made by the burning faggots .
Parsing [sent. 1773 len. 14]: I threw another faggot on each and went down for a further supply .
Parsing [sent. 1774 len. 39]: The gale had increased , and the spray now dashed over the rocks to where the faggots were burning , and threatened to extinguish them , but I put on more wood and kept up a fierce blaze .
Parsing [sent. 1775 len. 38]: In a quarter of an hour I could distinguish the boat ; it was now close to the island , perhaps three hundred yards distant , steering not directly for the lights , but more along shore .
Parsing [sent. 1776 len. 61]: The fact was that they had hauled up , not knowing how they could land until they had observed the two lights clear of each other , and then they understood why they had been made ; and a moment afterwards they bore up right for the entrance to the bathing-pool , and came rushing on before the rolling seas .
Parsing [sent. 1777 len. 96]: I still trembled for them , as I knew that if the sea receded at the time that they came to the ledge of rocks at the entrance , the boat would be dashed to pieces , although their lives might be saved , but fortunately for them , it was not so -- on the contrary , they came in borne up on a huge wave which carried them clear over the ledge , right up to the wall of rock which I had made across the pool , and then the boat grounded .
Parsing [sent. 1778 len. 3]: `` Hurrah !
Parsing [sent. 1779 len. 13]: well done , that , '' said a voice from the boat .
Parsing [sent. 1780 len. 14]: `` Lower away the sail , my lads ; all 's right . ''
Parsing [sent. 1781 len. 27]: The sail was lowered down , and then , by the light of the fire , I discovered that there were several people in the boat .
Parsing [sent. 1782 len. 20]: I had been too much excited to say anything ; indeed , I did not know what to say .
Parsing [sent. 1783 len. 20]: I only felt that I was no more alone , and the reader may imagine my joy and delight .
Parsing [sent. 1784 len. 29]: Chapter XIX As soon as the sail was lowered , the men leaped over the sides of the boat into the water , and waded to the rocks .
Parsing [sent. 1785 len. 6]: `` Who are you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1786 len. 20]: said one of the men , addressing me , `` and how many of you are there here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1787 len. 27]: `` There is no one on the island but myself , '' replied I ; `` but I 'm so glad that you have come . ''
Parsing [sent. 1788 len. 4]: `` Are you ?
Parsing [sent. 1789 len. 17]: Then perhaps you 'll tell us how to get something to eat , my hearty ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1790 len. 3]: replied he .
Parsing [sent. 1791 len. 49]: `` Oh yes , wait a little , and I 'll bring you plenty , '' replied I. `` Well , then , look smart , that 's a beauty , for we are hungry enough to eat you , if you can find us nothing better . ''
Parsing [sent. 1792 len. 31]: I was about to go up to the cabin for some birds , when another man called out -- `` I say -- can you get us any water ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1793 len. 28]: `` Oh yes , plenty , '' replied I. `` Well then , I say , Jim , hand us the pail out of the boat . ''
Parsing [sent. 1794 len. 29]: The one addressed did so , and the man put it into my hands , saying , `` Bring us that pail , boy , will you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1795 len. 75]: I hastened up to the cabin , filled the pail full of water , and then went for a quantity of dried birds , with which I hastened down again to the bathing-pool ; I found the men had not been idle , they had taken some faggots off the stack and made a large fire under the rocks , and were then busy making a sort of tent with the boat 's sails .
Parsing [sent. 1796 len. 23]: `` Here 's the water , and here 's some birds , '' said I , as I came up to them .
Parsing [sent. 1797 len. 3]: `` Birds !
Parsing [sent. 1798 len. 4]: what birds ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1799 len. 19]: said the man who had first spoken to me , and appeared to have control over the rest .
Parsing [sent. 1800 len. 24]: He took one up and examined it by the light of the fire , exclaiming , `` Queer eating , I expect . ''
Parsing [sent. 1801 len. 20]: `` Why , you did n't expect a regular hotel when you landed , did you , mate ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1802 len. 6]: said one of the men .
Parsing [sent. 1803 len. 21]: `` No , if I had , I would have called for a glass of grog , '' replied he .
Parsing [sent. 1804 len. 20]: `` I suspect I might call a long while before I get anyone to bring me one here . ''
Parsing [sent. 1805 len. 30]: As I knew that Jackson called the rum by the name of grog , I said , `` There 's plenty of grog , if you want any . ''
Parsing [sent. 1806 len. 11]: `` Is there , my hearty , -- where ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1807 len. 32]: `` Why , in that cask that 's in the water on the other side of your little ship , '' replied I. `` I can draw you some directly . ''
Parsing [sent. 1808 len. 3]: `` What !
Parsing [sent. 1809 len. 4]: in that cask ?
Parsing [sent. 1810 len. 12]: Grog floating about in salt water , that 's too bad .
Parsing [sent. 1811 len. 25]: Come here all of you -- You 're in earnest , boy -- no joking I hope , or you may repent it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1812 len. 16]: `` I 'm not joking , '' said I -- `` there it is . ''
Parsing [sent. 1813 len. 28]: The man , followed by all the rest , excepting one of the party , waded into the water , and went to the cask of rum .
Parsing [sent. 1814 len. 15]: `` Take care , '' said I , `` the spiles are in . ''
Parsing [sent. 1815 len. 18]: `` So I see -- never fear , my hearty -- come now all of us . ''
Parsing [sent. 1816 len. 43]: So saying , the whole of them laid hold of the cask by the chains , and lifting it up , they carried it clean out of the water , and placed it on the rocks by the side of the pool .
Parsing [sent. 1817 len. 31]: `` Hand us the little kid out of the boat , Jim , '' said the man ; `` we 'll soon see if it 's the right stuff . ''
Parsing [sent. 1818 len. 22]: He took out the spiles , drew off some of the liquor , and tasting it , swore it was excellent .
Parsing [sent. 1819 len. 13]: It was then handed round , and all the men took some .
Parsing [sent. 1820 len. 20]: `` We 're in luck to-night ; we 're fallen upon our legs , '' said the first man .
Parsing [sent. 1821 len. 47]: `` I say , Jim , put them dried chickens into the pitch-kettle along with some taters out of the bag -- they 'll make a good mess ; and then with this cask of grog to go to , we sha n't do badly . ''
Parsing [sent. 1822 len. 22]: `` I say , old fellow , '' said he , turning to me , `` you 're a regular trump .
Parsing [sent. 1823 len. 13]: Who left you on shore to get all ready for us ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1824 len. 13]: `` I was born here , '' replied I. `` Born here !
Parsing [sent. 1825 len. 34]: well , we 'll hear all about that to-morrow -- just now , we 'll make up for lost time , for we 've had nothing to eat or drink since Wednesday morning .
Parsing [sent. 1826 len. 6]: Look alive , my lads !
Parsing [sent. 1827 len. 5]: get up the hurricane-house .
Parsing [sent. 1828 len. 24]: Jim , put the pail of water into the kettle , and send the islander here for another pailful , for grog . ''
Parsing [sent. 1829 len. 38]: The pail was handed to me , and I soon returned with it full , and , as I did not see that they had a pannikin , I brought one down and gave it to them .
Parsing [sent. 1830 len. 23]: `` You 're a fine boy , '' said the mate ; -LRB- as I afterwards found out that he was -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 1831 len. 13]: `` And now , I say , where do you hold out ?
Parsing [sent. 1832 len. 12]: Have you a hut or a cave to live in ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1833 len. 25]: `` Yes , '' replied I ; `` I have a cabin , but it is not large enough for all of you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1834 len. 5]: `` No , no !
Parsing [sent. 1835 len. 37]: we do n't want to go there -- we are very well where we are , alongside of the cask of rum , but you see , my lad , we have a woman here . ''
Parsing [sent. 1836 len. 5]: `` A woman ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1837 len. 10]: said I ; `` I never saw a woman .
Parsing [sent. 1838 len. 5]: Where is she ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1839 len. 11]: `` There she is , sitting by the fire . ''
Parsing [sent. 1840 len. 37]: I looked round , and perceived that there was one of the party wrapped up in a blanket , and with a wide straw hat on the head , which completely concealed the form from me .
Parsing [sent. 1841 len. 21]: The fact is , that the woman looked like a bundle , and remained by the fire quite as inanimate .
Parsing [sent. 1842 len. 18]: At my saying that I never saw a woman , the man burst into a loud laugh .
Parsing [sent. 1843 len. 18]: `` Why , did you not say that you were born on the island , boy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1844 len. 6]: said the mate at last .
Parsing [sent. 1845 len. 9]: `` Were you born without a mother ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1846 len. 30]: `` I can not recollect my mother -- she died when I was very young ; and therefore I said , that I had never seen a woman . ''
Parsing [sent. 1847 len. 82]: `` Well , that 's explained ; but you see , my lad -- this is not only a woman , but a very particular sort of a woman ; and it will not do for her to remain here after we have had our supper -- for after supper , the men may take a drop too much , and not behave themselves ; so I asked you about your cabin , that you might take her there to sleep .
Parsing [sent. 1848 len. 6]: Can you do that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1849 len. 21]: `` Yes , '' replied I ; `` I will take her there , if she wishes to go . ''
Parsing [sent. 1850 len. 19]: `` That 's all right then , she 'll be better there than here , at all events .
Parsing [sent. 1851 len. 13]: I say , boy , where did you leave your trousers ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1852 len. 7]: `` I never wear any . ''
Parsing [sent. 1853 len. 28]: `` Well then , if you have any , I advise you to put them on , for you are quite old enough to be breeched . ''
Parsing [sent. 1854 len. 21]: I remained with them while the supper was cooking , asking all manner of questions , which caused great mirth .
Parsing [sent. 1855 len. 37]: The pitch kettle , which was a large iron pot on three short legs , surprised me a good deal , I had never seen such a thing before , or anything put on the fire .
Parsing [sent. 1856 len. 13]: I asked what it was , and what it was made of .
Parsing [sent. 1857 len. 16]: The potatoes also astonished me , as I had never yet seen an edible root .
Parsing [sent. 1858 len. 12]: `` Why , where have you been all your life ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1859 len. 6]: said one of the men .
Parsing [sent. 1860 len. 12]: `` On this island , '' replied I , very naively .
Parsing [sent. 1861 len. 39]: I waded into the water to examine the boat as well as I could by the light of the fire , but I could see little , and was obliged to defer my examination till the next day .
Parsing [sent. 1862 len. 18]: Before the supper was cooked and eaten , I did , however , gain the following information .
Parsing [sent. 1863 len. 74]: That they were a portion of the crew of a whaler , which had struck on a reef of rocks about seventy miles off , and that they had been obliged to leave her immediately , as she fell on her broadside a few minutes afterwards ; that they had left in two boats , but did not know what had become of the other boat , which parted company during the night .
Parsing [sent. 1864 len. 29]: The captain and six men were in the other boat , and the mate with six men in the one which had just landed -- besides the lady .
Parsing [sent. 1865 len. 7]: `` What 's a lady ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1866 len. 33]: said I. `` I mean the woman who sits there ; her husband was killed by some of the people of the Sandwich Isles , and she was going home to England .
Parsing [sent. 1867 len. 48]: We have a consort , another whaler , who was to have taken our cargo of oil on board , and to have gone to England with that and her own cargo , and the missionary 's wife was to have been sent home in her . ''
Parsing [sent. 1868 len. 7]: `` What 's a missionary ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1869 len. 25]: inquired I. `` Well , I do n't exactly know ; but he is a preacher who goes out to teach the savages . ''
Parsing [sent. 1870 len. 27]: By this time the supper was cooked , and the odour from the pitch kettle was more savoury than anything that I had ever yet smelt .
Parsing [sent. 1871 len. 57]: The kettle was lifted off the fire , the contents of it poured into a kid , and after they had given a portion in the small kid to the woman , who still remained huddled up in the blanket by the fire , they all sat round the large kid , and commenced their supper .
Parsing [sent. 1872 len. 44]: `` Come , boy , and join us , '' said the mate , `` you ca n't have had your supper ; and as you 've found one for us , it 's hard but you should share it with us . ''
Parsing [sent. 1873 len. 27]: I was not sorry to do as he told me , and I must say that I never enjoyed a repast so much in my life .
Parsing [sent. 1874 len. 19]: `` I say , boy , have you a good stock of them dried chickens of yours ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1875 len. 4]: said the mate .
Parsing [sent. 1876 len. 21]: `` Yes , I have a great many , but not enough to last long for so many people . ''
Parsing [sent. 1877 len. 14]: `` Well , but we can get more , ca n't we ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1878 len. 4]: `` No ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1879 len. 23]: replied I , `` not until the birds come again , and that will not be for these next five moons . ''
Parsing [sent. 1880 len. 4]: `` Five moons !
Parsing [sent. 1881 len. 6]: what do you mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1882 len. 15]: `` I mean , five full moons must come , one after another . ''
Parsing [sent. 1883 len. 17]: `` Oh , I understand ; why then we must not remain on the island . ''
Parsing [sent. 1884 len. 35]: `` No , '' replied I , `` we must all go , or we shall starve ; I am so glad that you are come , and the sooner you go the better .
Parsing [sent. 1885 len. 8]: Will you take Nero with you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1886 len. 6]: `` Who is Nero ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1887 len. 12]: `` Nero -- my seal -- he 's very tame . ''
Parsing [sent. 1888 len. 46]: `` Well , we 'll see about it ; at all events , '' said he , turning to the other men , `` we must decide upon something , and that quickly , for we shall starve if we remain here any time . ''
Parsing [sent. 1889 len. 55]: It appeared that they had left the whaler in such a hurry , that they had only had time to throw into the boat two breakers of water , four empty breakers to fill with saltwater for ballast to the boat , and the iron pitch kettle , with a large sack of potatoes .
Parsing [sent. 1890 len. 47]: As soon as supper was finished , they went to the cask for the rum , and then the mate said to me -- `` Now I 'll go and speak to the woman , and you shall take her to sleep in your cabin . ''
Parsing [sent. 1891 len. 21]: During the whole of this time the woman , as the mate called her , had never spoken a word .
Parsing [sent. 1892 len. 24]: She had taken her supper , and eaten it in silence , still remaining by the fire , huddled up in the blanket .
Parsing [sent. 1893 len. 38]: On the mate speaking to her , she rose up , and I then perceived that she was much taller than I thought she could have been ; but her Panama hat still concealed her face altogether .
Parsing [sent. 1894 len. 34]: `` Now then , my lad , '' said the mate , `` shew the lady where she is to sleep , and then you can join us again if you like . ''
Parsing [sent. 1895 len. 8]: `` Will you come with me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1896 len. 6]: said I , walking away .
Parsing [sent. 1897 len. 8]: The woman followed me up the path .
Parsing [sent. 1898 len. 25]: When we arrived at the platform opposite the cabin , I recollected Nero , whom I had ordered to stay there till my return .
Parsing [sent. 1899 len. 18]: `` You wo n't be afraid of the seal , '' said I , `` will you ?
Parsing [sent. 1900 len. 5]: he is very good-natured .
Parsing [sent. 1901 len. 6]: Nero , come here . ''
Parsing [sent. 1902 len. 28]: It was rather dark as Nero came shuffling up , and I went forward to coax him , for he snarled a little at seeing a stranger .
Parsing [sent. 1903 len. 9]: `` Have you no light at hand ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1904 len. 18]: said my companion , speaking for the first time in a very soft , yet clear voice .
Parsing [sent. 1905 len. 34]: `` No , I have not , but I will get some tinder , and make a fire with one of the faggots , and then you will be able to see . ''
Parsing [sent. 1906 len. 14]: `` Do so , then , my good lad , '' replied she .
Parsing [sent. 1907 len. 7]: I thought her voice very pleasing .
Parsing [sent. 1908 len. 26]: I soon lighted the faggot and enabled her to see Nero -LRB- who was now quite quiet -RRB- and also the interior of the cabin .
Parsing [sent. 1909 len. 19]: She examined the cabin and the bed-places , and then said , `` Where do you sleep ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1910 len. 8]: I replied by shewing her my bed-place .
Parsing [sent. 1911 len. 26]: `` And this , '' said I , pointing to the one opposite , `` was Jackson 's , and you can sleep in that .
Parsing [sent. 1912 len. 5]: Nero sleeps with me .
Parsing [sent. 1913 len. 15]: Here are plenty of seal skins to keep you warm if you are cold .
Parsing [sent. 1914 len. 6]: Are your clothes wet ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1915 len. 37]: `` No , they are quite dry now , '' replied she ; `` if you will get me some seal skins , I will lie down on them , for I am very tired . ''
Parsing [sent. 1916 len. 36]: I spread five or six skins one on the other , in Jackson 's bed-place , and then I went out and threw another faggot on the fire , that we might have more light .
Parsing [sent. 1917 len. 8]: `` Do you want anything else ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1918 len. 9]: said I. `` Nothing , I thank you .
Parsing [sent. 1919 len. 8]: Are you going to bed now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1920 len. 36]: `` I was meaning to go down again to the men , but now I think of it , I do not like to leave you alone with Nero , as he might bite you .
Parsing [sent. 1921 len. 7]: Are you afraid of him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1922 len. 35]: `` No , I 'm not much afraid , but still I have no wish to be bitten , and I am not used to sleep with such animals , as you are . ''
Parsing [sent. 1923 len. 14]: `` Well then , I 'll tell you how we 'll manage it .
Parsing [sent. 1924 len. 11]: I will take some skins outside , and sleep there .
Parsing [sent. 1925 len. 14]: Nero will not leave me , and then you wo n't be afraid .
Parsing [sent. 1926 len. 31]: The weather is clearing up fast , and there 's very little wind to what there was -- besides , it will be daylight in three or four hours . ''
Parsing [sent. 1927 len. 10]: `` As you please , '' was the reply .
Parsing [sent. 1928 len. 42]: Accordingly I took some seal skins out on the platform , and spreading them , I lay down upon them , wishing her good-night , and Nero soon joined me , and we were both fast asleep in a few minutes .
Parsing [sent. 1929 len. 40]: Chapter XX Nero , who was an early riser , woke me up at day-break , or I should have slept much longer ; for I had been tired out with the fatigue and excitement of the night before .
Parsing [sent. 1930 len. 36]: As soon as I was up , I looked into the cabin , and found the woman was fast asleep ; her straw hat was off , but she had lain down in her clothes .
Parsing [sent. 1931 len. 9]: Her black hair was hanging about her shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 1932 len. 59]: Having only seen Jackson with his bushy beard , I had been somewhat surprised when I first saw the men on their landing so comparatively clear of hair on their face ; my astonishment at the clear white skin of a woman -- and in this instance , it was peculiarly white and pallid -- was very great .
Parsing [sent. 1933 len. 45]: I also perceived how much more delicate her features were than those of the men ; her teeth , too , were very white , and Jackson 's were discoloured and bad ; I longed to see her eyes , but they were closed .
Parsing [sent. 1934 len. 20]: Any other difference I could not perceive , as she had drawn the blanket close up to her chin .
Parsing [sent. 1935 len. 31]: `` This is then a woman , '' said I to myself : `` yes , and it 's very like what I used to see in my dreams . ''
Parsing [sent. 1936 len. 31]: I looked a little longer , and then , hearing Nero coming into the cabin behind me , and afraid that she would awake , I made a hasty retreat .
Parsing [sent. 1937 len. 14]: I remained at this part of the cabin considering what I should do .
Parsing [sent. 1938 len. 33]: I thought I would light a fire , and go down for a fish to broil on the embers for her breakfast , so I called Nero to come down with me .
Parsing [sent. 1939 len. 63]: On arriving at the pool , I found all the seamen fast asleep under the tent they had made with the boat 's sails ; and they appeared to be much the same as Jackson used to be after he had got drunk the night before ; I presumed therefore , that such was their state , and was not far wrong .
Parsing [sent. 1940 len. 27]: Nero went into the pool and brought out a fish , as I ordered him , and I then walked to the boat to examine it .
Parsing [sent. 1941 len. 29]: This took me half an hour , and I was sorry that none of the men were awake , that so I might ask any questions I wished .
Parsing [sent. 1942 len. 15]: I examined the pitch-kettle , and the boat 's sails , and the breakers .
Parsing [sent. 1943 len. 21]: Breakers are small casks , holding about six to seven gallons of water , and are very handy for boats .
Parsing [sent. 1944 len. 30]: I remained about an hour , and then went back to the cabin , carrying a faggot on my shoulder , Nero following with the fish in his mouth .
Parsing [sent. 1945 len. 35]: We were met by the woman , who came out of the cabin ; she no longer had the blanket round her , for it was a beautiful bright morning , and very warm .
Parsing [sent. 1946 len. 21]: `` Nero is bringing you your breakfast , '' said I , `` so you ought to like him . ''
Parsing [sent. 1947 len. 20]: `` I dare say I shall , if we are to be companions in future , '' replied she .
Parsing [sent. 1948 len. 7]: `` Do you want anything ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1949 len. 17]: said I. `` Yes , a little water , if you can get me some . ''
Parsing [sent. 1950 len. 35]: I filled the kid from the spring , put it down by her , and then took out the inside of the fish , and fed the birds , who were crowding round me .
Parsing [sent. 1951 len. 21]: The woman washed her face and hands , braided up her hair , and then sat down on the rock .
Parsing [sent. 1952 len. 32]: In the meantime , I had lighted my faggot , cleaned the fish , and waited till the wood was burnt to ashes before I put the fish on the fire .
Parsing [sent. 1953 len. 23]: Having then nothing to do , I thought that reading would amuse the woman , and I went in for the Bible .
Parsing [sent. 1954 len. 8]: `` Shall I read to you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1955 len. 16]: said I. `` Yes , '' replied she , with some astonishment in her looks .
Parsing [sent. 1956 len. 21]: I read to her the history of Joseph and his brethren , which was my favourite story in the Bible .
Parsing [sent. 1957 len. 8]: `` Who taught you to read ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1958 len. 17]: said she , as I shut the book , and put the fish on the embers .
Parsing [sent. 1959 len. 18]: `` Jackson , '' said I. `` He was a good man , was he not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1960 len. 3]: replied she .
Parsing [sent. 1961 len. 5]: I shook my head .
Parsing [sent. 1962 len. 14]: `` No , not very good , '' said I , at last .
Parsing [sent. 1963 len. 22]: `` If you knew all about him , you would say the same ; but he taught me to read . ''
Parsing [sent. 1964 len. 11]: `` How long have you been on this island ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1965 len. 3]: said she .
Parsing [sent. 1966 len. 37]: `` I was born on it , but my father and mother are both dead , and Jackson died three years ago -- since that I have been quite alone , only Nero with me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1967 len. 69]: She then asked me a great many more questions , and I gave her a short narration of what had passed , and what Jackson had told me ; I also informed her how it was I procured food , and how we must soon leave the island , now that we were so many , or the food would not last out till the birds came again .
Parsing [sent. 1968 len. 41]: By this time the fish was cooked , and I took it off the fire and put it into the kid , and we sat down to breakfast ; in an hour or so , we had become very sociable .
Parsing [sent. 1969 len. 11]: I must however now stop a little to describe her .
Parsing [sent. 1970 len. 10]: What the men had told me was quite true .
Parsing [sent. 1971 len. 14]: She had lost her husband , and was intending to proceed to England .
Parsing [sent. 1972 len. 17]: Her name was Reichardt , for her husband was a German , or of German family .
Parsing [sent. 1973 len. 54]: She was , as I have since ascertained , about thirty-seven years old , and very tall and elegant ; she must have been very handsome when she was younger , but she had suffered much hardship in following her husband as she had done , through all the vicissitudes of his travels .
Parsing [sent. 1974 len. 50]: Her face was oval ; eyes black and large ; and her hair black as the raven 's wing ; her features were small and regular ; her teeth white and good ; but her complexion was very pallid , and not a vestige of colour on her cheeks .
Parsing [sent. 1975 len. 21]: As I have since thought , it was more like a marble statue than anything I can compare her to .
Parsing [sent. 1976 len. 23]: There was a degree of severity in her countenance when she did not smile , and it was seldom that she did .
Parsing [sent. 1977 len. 49]: I certainly looked upon her with more awe than regard , for some time after I became acquainted with her ; and yet her voice was soft and pleasant , and her manners very amiable ; but it must be remembered I had never before seen a woman .
Parsing [sent. 1978 len. 34]: After breakfast was over , I proposed going down to where the seamen lay , to see if they were awake , but I told her I thought that they would not be .
Parsing [sent. 1979 len. 35]: `` I will go with you , as I left a basket with some things of mine in the boat , and it will be as well to bring them up at once . ''
Parsing [sent. 1980 len. 16]: We therefore set off together , I having ordered Nero to stay in the cabin .
Parsing [sent. 1981 len. 41]: On our arrival at the pool we found the men still fast asleep ; and by her directions I went into the water to the boat , and brought out a basket and a small bundle which she pointed out .
Parsing [sent. 1982 len. 7]: `` Shall I wake them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1983 len. 25]: said I. `` No , no , '' replied she ; `` so long as they sleep , they will be doing no harm .
Parsing [sent. 1984 len. 34]: But , '' said she , `` we may as well take some potatoes up with us ; fill both these handkerchiefs , '' continued she , taking two out of the bundle .
Parsing [sent. 1985 len. 20]: I did so , and she took one and I the other , and we returned to the cabin .
Parsing [sent. 1986 len. 13]: `` Are these all the birds that you have for food ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1987 len. 11]: said she , looking at the pile in the cabin .
Parsing [sent. 1988 len. 18]: `` Yes , '' replied I. `` But what are we to do with the potatoes ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1989 len. 29]: `` We can roast them by the fire if we like , '' said she ; `` but at present we had better take them into the cabin .
Parsing [sent. 1990 len. 15]: Did you plant all these flowers and creepers which grow over the cabin ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1991 len. 26]: `` Yes , '' replied I. `` I was alone and had nothing to do , so I thought I would make a garden . ''
Parsing [sent. 1992 len. 6]: `` They are very pretty .
Parsing [sent. 1993 len. 45]: Now that I am back , you can go down to the men if you please , and tell them , when they wake up , that I wish to have the smallest of the boat 's sails , to make a screen of .
Parsing [sent. 1994 len. 11]: Tell the mate , he is the most civil . ''
Parsing [sent. 1995 len. 14]: `` I will , '' said I. `` Is there anything else ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1996 len. 25]: `` Yes , bring up a few more potatoes ; they will let you take them if you say that I told you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1997 len. 9]: `` Shall I take Nero with me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1998 len. 20]: `` Yes , I do not want his company , for I am a little afraid of him . ''
Parsing [sent. 1999 len. 52]: I called Nero , who came after me , and went down to the pool , when I found that the men had all woke up , and were very busy , some lighting a fire , some washing potatoes , and some trying to catch the fish in the pool .
Parsing [sent. 2000 len. 7]: `` Oh , here he is .
Parsing [sent. 2001 len. 12]: Come , boy , what have you got for our breakfast ?
Parsing [sent. 2002 len. 20]: We 've been trying to catch some of these fish , but they 're as quick as eels . ''
Parsing [sent. 2003 len. 21]: `` Nero will soon catch you what you want , '' replied I. `` Here , Nero , in . ''
Parsing [sent. 2004 len. 20]: Nero plunged in , and soon brought out a fish , and I then sent him in for another .
Parsing [sent. 2005 len. 19]: `` Thanks , lad , '' said the mate ; `` that will be enough for our breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 2006 len. 14]: That seal of yours is a handy fellow , and well trained . ''
Parsing [sent. 2007 len. 45]: While the other men were getting breakfast , one of them went up to Nero , I believe with the intention of making friends with him , but Nero rejected his advances , and showed his sharp teeth , snapping at him several times .
Parsing [sent. 2008 len. 18]: The man became angry , and caught up a piece of rock to throw at the seal .
Parsing [sent. 2009 len. 14]: He aimed at the animal 's nose , and narrowly missed hitting it .
Parsing [sent. 2010 len. 12]: Had he done so , he would probably have killed it .
Parsing [sent. 2011 len. 67]: This made me very angry , and I told the man not to do so again ; upon this , he caught up another , and was about to throw it , when I seized him by the collar with my left hand , and with my right drawing my American knife , I threatened to stab him with it , if he attacked the beast .
Parsing [sent. 2012 len. 21]: The man started back , and in so doing , fell over a piece of rock , on his back .
Parsing [sent. 2013 len. 17]: This quarrel brought the mate to us , along with two or three of the men .
Parsing [sent. 2014 len. 27]: My knife was still lifted up , when the mate said -- `` Come , my hearty , no knives , we do n't allow them .
Parsing [sent. 2015 len. 5]: That 's not English .
Parsing [sent. 2016 len. 15]: Put it up , no one shall hurt the beast , I promise you .
Parsing [sent. 2017 len. 14]: Bob , you fool , why could n't you leave the animal alone ?
Parsing [sent. 2018 len. 10]: You forget you are among savages , here . ''
Parsing [sent. 2019 len. 12]: At this , the other men burst out into a laugh .
Parsing [sent. 2020 len. 47]: `` Yes , '' observed one ; `` I can swear , when I get back , that the natives of this island are savages , who eat raw flesh , have seals for playmates , and do n't wear clothes enough for common decency . ''
Parsing [sent. 2021 len. 34]: This made them laugh more , and the man who had attacked Nero , and who had got upon his legs again , joined with the others ; so all was again good-humour .
Parsing [sent. 2022 len. 43]: The men sat down to their breakfast , while I examined the boat again , and afterwards asked many questions , with which they were much amused , every now and then observing , `` Well , he is a savage ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2023 len. 51]: After they had breakfasted , I made Nero catch another fish and sent him up to the cabin with it , as I was afraid that the man might do him an injury , and then told the mate that the woman had desired me to bring up some potatoes .
Parsing [sent. 2024 len. 19]: `` Take them , '' said he ; `` but you have nothing to carry them up with .
Parsing [sent. 2025 len. 17]: Here , fill the pail , and I will go to the cabin with you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2026 len. 25]: `` She told me that I was to ask you for a small boat 's sail , to hang up as a screen . ''
Parsing [sent. 2027 len. 11]: `` Well , she shall have the boat 's mizen .
Parsing [sent. 2028 len. 6]: We do n't want it .
Parsing [sent. 2029 len. 7]: I 'll carry it up . ''
Parsing [sent. 2030 len. 19]: The mate threw the sail and yard over his shoulder , and followed me up to the cabin .
Parsing [sent. 2031 len. 28]: On our arrival , we found the missionary 's wife sitting on the platform , Nero lying not far from her , with the fish beside him .
Parsing [sent. 2032 len. 26]: The mate took off his hat , and saluted my new companion , saying , `` That he hoped she was comfortable last night . ''
Parsing [sent. 2033 len. 46]: `` Yes , '' replied she , `` as much so as I could expect ; but I turned this good lad out of his cabin , which I do not wish to do again , and therefore I requested the sail for a screen .
Parsing [sent. 2034 len. 13]: Now , John Gough , what do you intend to do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2035 len. 3]: continued she .
Parsing [sent. 2036 len. 20]: The mate replied , `` I came up here to see what quantity of provisions the lad might have .
Parsing [sent. 2037 len. 34]: By his account , it will not last more than a month , and it will take some time before we can reach where we are likely to fall in with any vessel .
Parsing [sent. 2038 len. 28]: Stay here we can not , for we shall only eat the provision and lose time , therefore , the sooner we are off the better . ''
Parsing [sent. 2039 len. 19]: `` If you take all the provision , of course you will take the lad with you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2040 len. 3]: replied she .
Parsing [sent. 2041 len. 7]: `` Of course we will . ''
Parsing [sent. 2042 len. 10]: `` And my chest , and my seal ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2043 len. 49]: inquired I. `` Yes , your chest , certainly , but as for your seal , I do not know what to say to that -- he will be starved in the boat , and if you give him his liberty , he will do well enough . ''
Parsing [sent. 2044 len. 13]: `` What you say is very true , '' replied the woman .
Parsing [sent. 2045 len. 17]: `` I am afraid , boy , that you will have to part with your friend .
Parsing [sent. 2046 len. 10]: It will be better for both of you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2047 len. 34]: I made no reply , for it cut me to the heart to think of parting with Nero ; but still I had sense enough to perceive that what they said was right .
Parsing [sent. 2048 len. 39]: The mate then went into the cabin , and examined the heap of dried birds which I had collected , and having made his calculation , said that there were sufficient for three weeks , but not more .
Parsing [sent. 2049 len. 12]: `` And when do you think of leaving this island ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2050 len. 4]: inquired the woman .
Parsing [sent. 2051 len. 48]: `` The day after to-morrow , if I can persuade the men , madam , '' replied he ; `` but you know they are not very easy to manage , and very thoughtless , especially now that they have so unexpectedly fallen in with liquor . ''
Parsing [sent. 2052 len. 32]: `` That I admit , '' replied she ; `` but as they will probably take the liquor in the boat , that will not make so great a difference . ''
Parsing [sent. 2053 len. 41]: `` I shall go down and speak to them now they 're all sober , '' replied the mate , `` and will let you know in the evening , or to-morrow morning , perhaps , will be better . ''
Parsing [sent. 2054 len. 14]: The mate then saluted her by touching his hat , and left us .
Parsing [sent. 2055 len. 24]: Chapter XXI There was one thing which had made a great impression on me in the conversation with the men in the morning .
Parsing [sent. 2056 len. 60]: They called me a Savage , and said that I had not sufficient clothes on ; and as I observed that they were all dressed in jackets and trousers , which covered them from head to foot , I took it for granted that my shirt , which was all that I wore , was not a sufficient clothing .
Parsing [sent. 2057 len. 17]: This had never occurred to me before , nor can the reader be surprised at it .
Parsing [sent. 2058 len. 36]: I had been like our first parents in Eden -- naked but not ashamed -- but now that I had suddenly come in contact with my fellow-men , I felt as if something were amiss .
Parsing [sent. 2059 len. 24]: The consequence was , that I went to the chest and got out a pair of white trousers , and put them on .
Parsing [sent. 2060 len. 25]: I thought them very uncomfortable and very unnecessary articles , but others wore them , and I felt that I must do so also .
Parsing [sent. 2061 len. 53]: They were rather long for me , but I rolled up the bottoms of the legs , as I observed that the seamen did , and then came out on the platform , where the missionary 's wife was still seated , looking out upon the waves as they lashed the rocks .
Parsing [sent. 2062 len. 23]: She immediately observed the addition that I had made to my dress , and said , `` That is a great improvement .
Parsing [sent. 2063 len. 7]: Now you look like other people .
Parsing [sent. 2064 len. 5]: What is your name ?
Parsing [sent. 2065 len. 7]: you have not told me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2066 len. 36]: When I had answered the question , I said to her -- `` I have brought up more of the potatoes , as you call them ; what am I to do with them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2067 len. 39]: `` First tell me , have you any spot that you know about the island where there is mould -- that is , earth , like you have in your garden -- where we can plant them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2068 len. 24]: `` Yes , '' replied I , `` there is some up there , '' and I pointed to one-third up the ravine .
Parsing [sent. 2069 len. 26]: `` I brought all this earth from there , and there is plenty of it ; but what is the good of planting them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2070 len. 67]: `` Because , '' said she , `` one of the potatoes planted will , in a very short time , grow , and then it will produce perhaps thirty or forty potatoes at its roots as large as these ; they are excellent things for food , and where there is nothing else to be had , may be the means of preserving life . ''
Parsing [sent. 2071 len. 49]: `` Well , that may be , '' replied I , `` and if we were going to remain on the island , it would be well to plant them , but as we are going away the day after to-morrow , what 's the use of it ?
Parsing [sent. 2072 len. 18]: I know that they are very nice , for I had some for supper last night . ''
Parsing [sent. 2073 len. 19]: `` But are we only to think of ourselves in this world , and not of others ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2074 len. 3]: replied she .
Parsing [sent. 2075 len. 60]: `` Suppose , two or three years hence , another boat were to be cast away on this island , and not find , as we have , you here , with provisions ready for them , they would starve miserably ; whereas , if we plant these potatoes , they may find plenty of food and be saved .
Parsing [sent. 2076 len. 25]: Only think how glad your father and mother would have been to have found potatoes on the island when they were thrown on it .
Parsing [sent. 2077 len. 29]: We must not live only for ourselves , but we must think and try to do good to others -- that is the duty of a Christian . ''
Parsing [sent. 2078 len. 20]: `` I think you are very right , '' replied I , `` and a very kind person too .
Parsing [sent. 2079 len. 14]: If you wish it I will go and plant the potatoes this day .
Parsing [sent. 2080 len. 8]: How am I to plant them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2081 len. 25]: `` They have a shovel in the boat , '' said she , `` for I saw them throwing the water out with it .
Parsing [sent. 2082 len. 18]: Go down and get it , and then I will go with you and show you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2083 len. 18]: I went down and the mate gave me the shovel , which I carried up to her .
Parsing [sent. 2084 len. 32]: I found her cutting the potatoes into pieces , and she showed me how she cut them , leaving an eye in each piece , and explained the reason for it .
Parsing [sent. 2085 len. 25]: I was soon very busy cutting away alongside of her , and before long the pail of potatoes was all ready to be planted .
Parsing [sent. 2086 len. 23]: We then walked to the ravine , and she showed me how to use the shovel , and I made the holes .
Parsing [sent. 2087 len. 29]: Before noon we had planted all that we had cut , but we had still the two handkerchiefs full that we had at first brought up with us .
Parsing [sent. 2088 len. 14]: We returned to the cabin , and I prepared the fish for dinner .
Parsing [sent. 2089 len. 19]: After it was on the embers , she wished to have the screen put up beside her bed-place .
Parsing [sent. 2090 len. 24]: `` Go down to the mate , '' said she , `` and ask him for the hammer and three or four nails .
Parsing [sent. 2091 len. 10]: I know they have them in the boat . ''
Parsing [sent. 2092 len. 26]: `` I may as well take them down some birds for their dinner , '' replied I , `` for they will want them . ''
Parsing [sent. 2093 len. 19]: `` Yes , do so ; and then come back to me as soon as you can . ''
Parsing [sent. 2094 len. 38]: The mate gave me the hammer , an article I had never seen before , and five or six nails , with which I returned to the cabin , and nailed up the sail as a screen .
Parsing [sent. 2095 len. 18]: `` Now you will be able to sleep in your own bed-place to-night , '' said she .
Parsing [sent. 2096 len. 44]: I made no reply , but I could not imagine why I could not have done so the night before , for I had only gone out of the cabin that she might not be frightened by Nero being so close to her .
Parsing [sent. 2097 len. 31]: After we had eaten our dinner , she said to me -- `` How could you contrive to live on this island , if you had no dried birds ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2098 len. 4]: `` How ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2099 len. 9]: replied I ; `` why , very badly .
Parsing [sent. 2100 len. 34]: I might catch fish ; but there are times in the year when you can catch no fish , they wo n't take bait , neither will they when the weather is rough .
Parsing [sent. 2101 len. 22]: Besides , I have only two lines , and I might lose them both -- then what would become of me ?
Parsing [sent. 2102 len. 5]: I should starve . ''
Parsing [sent. 2103 len. 34]: `` Well , then , you see under all circumstances , it was just as well to plant the potatoes , for other people may come here and be in your position . ''
Parsing [sent. 2104 len. 28]: `` Yes , that is true , but we shall not be here long now , and you do n't know how glad I am to go .
Parsing [sent. 2105 len. 16]: I want to see all the things that I have read about in my books .
Parsing [sent. 2106 len. 31]: I want to go to England and look for somebody ; but you do n't know all that I know ; some day I will tell you all -- everything .
Parsing [sent. 2107 len. 35]: I am so tired of living here by myself -- nothing to say -- no one to talk to -- no one to care for , except Nero , and he ca n't speak .
Parsing [sent. 2108 len. 13]: I ca n't bear the idea of parting with him though . ''
Parsing [sent. 2109 len. 18]: `` Would you rather stay on the island with Nero , than go away without him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2110 len. 23]: `` No , '' replied I ; `` go I must , but still I do not like to part with him .
Parsing [sent. 2111 len. 16]: He is the only friend that I ever had , that I can remember . ''
Parsing [sent. 2112 len. 46]: `` When you have lived longer , and mixed more with the world , my poor boy , you will then find how many sacrifices you will be obliged to make , much more serious than parting with an animal that you are attached to .
Parsing [sent. 2113 len. 17]: I suppose you expect to be very happy if ever you get back to England ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2114 len. 13]: `` Of course I do ; why should I not be ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2115 len. 11]: replied I ; `` I shall be always happy . ''
Parsing [sent. 2116 len. 8]: The Missionary 's wife shook her head .
Parsing [sent. 2117 len. 5]: `` I fear not .
Parsing [sent. 2118 len. 27]: Indeed , I think if you live long enough , you will acknowledge that the happiest of your days were passed on this barren rock . ''
Parsing [sent. 2119 len. 74]: `` Jackson said otherwise , '' replied I. `` He was always grieving at being on the island , and not able to get back to England , and he told me so many stories about England , and what is done there , and what a beautiful place it is , that I 'm sure I shall like it better than being here , even if I had somebody with me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2120 len. 20]: `` Well , you are in the hands of God , and you must put your trust in him .
Parsing [sent. 2121 len. 23]: He will do with you as he thinks best for you -- that you know , as you read your Bible . ''
Parsing [sent. 2122 len. 25]: `` No , I did n't know that , '' replied I. `` God lives beyond the stars , a long way off . ''
Parsing [sent. 2123 len. 13]: `` Is that all you have gained by reading your Bible ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2124 len. 9]: inquired she , looking me in the face .
Parsing [sent. 2125 len. 31]: `` No , not all , '' replied I ; `` but I do not understand a great deal that I read , I want some one to tell me .
Parsing [sent. 2126 len. 21]: I am so glad you came with the men in the boat , for I never saw a woman before .
Parsing [sent. 2127 len. 18]: I used to see somebody in my dreams , and now I know it was a woman .
Parsing [sent. 2128 len. 25]: It was my mother , but I have not seen her for a long while now , and I have nobody but Nero . ''
Parsing [sent. 2129 len. 13]: `` My poor boy , you have a father in heaven . ''
Parsing [sent. 2130 len. 32]: `` Yes , '' replied I ; `` I know he is in heaven , and so is my mother , for Jackson said that they were both very good . ''
Parsing [sent. 2131 len. 9]: `` I mean your Heavenly Father , God .
Parsing [sent. 2132 len. 19]: Do you not say in the Lord 's Prayer , ` Our Father which art in heaven . '
Parsing [sent. 2133 len. 6]: You must love him . ''
Parsing [sent. 2134 len. 76]: I was about to reply , when John Gough , the mate , came up , and told my companion that he had been speaking to the men , and they had agreed that the day after the next they would , if the weather permitted , leave the island ; that they had examined the boat , and found it required very little repair , and that all would be ready the next day .
Parsing [sent. 2135 len. 15]: `` I hope that they will not overload the boat , '' said she .
Parsing [sent. 2136 len. 18]: `` I fear that they will , but I must do all I can to prevent it .
Parsing [sent. 2137 len. 18]: The cask of rum was rather an unfortunate discovery , and we had been better without it .
Parsing [sent. 2138 len. 45]: Leave it they will not , so we must put out of the boat all that we can possibly do without , for we shall be nine of us , and that will be plenty of weight with the addition of the cask . ''
Parsing [sent. 2139 len. 65]: `` You promised to take my chest , you remember , '' said I. `` Yes , I will do so if I possibly can ; but recollect , I may not be able to keep my promise -- for now that they have the liquor , the men do not obey me as they did before , ma'am , '' said the mate .
Parsing [sent. 2140 len. 81]: `` Perhaps he had better take the best of his clothes in a bundle , in case they should refuse to take in the chest ; and I must say that , loaded as the boat will be , they will be much to blame if they do not refuse , for the boat is but small for stowage , and there 's all the provisions to put in her , which will take up a deal of room . ''
Parsing [sent. 2141 len. 11]: `` That is very true , '' replied the woman .
Parsing [sent. 2142 len. 23]: `` It will be better to leave the chest here , for I do not think that the boat will hold it .
Parsing [sent. 2143 len. 19]: You must not mind your chest , my good boy ; it is of no great value . ''
Parsing [sent. 2144 len. 22]: `` They take my rum and all my birds , and they ought to take both me and my chest . ''
Parsing [sent. 2145 len. 15]: `` Not if it takes up too much room , '' replied the woman .
Parsing [sent. 2146 len. 7]: `` You can not expect it .
Parsing [sent. 2147 len. 15]: The wishes of one person must give way to the wishes of many . ''
Parsing [sent. 2148 len. 20]: `` Why they would have starved if it had not been for me , '' replied I , angrily .
Parsing [sent. 2149 len. 45]: `` That 's very true , boy , '' replied the mate ; `` but you have to learn yet , that might is right ; and recollect that what you did this morning has not made you any great favourite with them . ''
Parsing [sent. 2150 len. 6]: `` What was that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2151 len. 4]: inquired my companion .
Parsing [sent. 2152 len. 34]: `` Only that he nearly drove his knife through one of the men , that 's all , '' replied the mate ; `` English sailors ar 'n' t fond of knives . ''
Parsing [sent. 2153 len. 29]: He then touched his hat , and went down again to the pool , desiring me to follow him with a kid for our share of the supper .
Parsing [sent. 2154 len. 28]: I did so , and on my return she asked me why I had drawn my knife upon the seaman , and I narrated how it occurred .
Parsing [sent. 2155 len. 28]: She pointed out to me the impropriety of what I had done , asking me whether the Bible did not tell us we were to forgive injuries .
Parsing [sent. 2156 len. 16]: `` Yes , '' replied I ; `` but is it not injuries to ourselves ?
Parsing [sent. 2157 len. 15]: I did forgive Jackson ; but this was to prevent his hurting another . ''
Parsing [sent. 2158 len. 3]: `` Another !
Parsing [sent. 2159 len. 27]: why you talk of Nero as if the animal was a rational being , and his life of as much consequence as that of a fellow-creature .
Parsing [sent. 2160 len. 51]: I do not mean to say but that the man was very wrong , and that you must have felt angry if an animal you were so fond of had been killed ; but there is a great difference between the life of an animal and that of a fellow-creature .
Parsing [sent. 2161 len. 40]: The animal dies , and there is an end of it ; but a man has an immortal soul , which never perishes , and nothing can excuse your taking the life of a man , except in self-defence .
Parsing [sent. 2162 len. 14]: Does not the commandment say , ` Thou shalt not kill ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 2163 len. 33]: She then talked to me a long while upon the subject , and fully made me understand that I had been very wrong , and I confessed that I had been so .
Parsing [sent. 2164 len. 37]: Chapter XXII I now resolved to speak to her relative to the belt which contained the diamonds ; and I was first obliged to narrate to her in a few words what Jackson had told me .
Parsing [sent. 2165 len. 14]: She heard me with great interest , now and then asking a question .
Parsing [sent. 2166 len. 27]: When I had told her all , I said -- `` Now , as they talk of not taking my chest , what shall I do ?
Parsing [sent. 2167 len. 16]: Shall I wear the belt myself , or shall I put it in the bundle ?
Parsing [sent. 2168 len. 22]: or will you wear it for me , as my mother would have done , if she had been alive ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2169 len. 35]: She did not reply for some time , at last she said , as if talking to herself , and not to me -- `` How unsearchable are thy ways , O God ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2170 len. 77]: Indeed , although I did not feel it at the time , I have afterwards thought , and she told me herself , how great her surprise was at finding in the unshorn little Savage , thus living alone upon a desolate rock , a lad of good birth , and although he did not know it , with a fortune in his charge , which would , in all probability , be ultimately his own .
Parsing [sent. 2171 len. 23]: This is certain , that the interest she felt towards me increased every hour , as by degrees I disclosed my history .
Parsing [sent. 2172 len. 22]: `` Well , '' replied she , `` if you will trust me , I will take charge of your belt .
Parsing [sent. 2173 len. 27]: To-morrow we will select out of the chest what will be best to take with you , and then we will arrange as you wish . ''
Parsing [sent. 2174 len. 45]: After about an hour 's more conversation , she went into the cabin , and retired behind the screen which had been fixed up , telling me that she did not mind Nero , and that I might go to bed when I pleased .
Parsing [sent. 2175 len. 46]: As I was not much inclined to go down to the seamen , I followed her advice and went to bed ; but I could not sleep for a long time from the noise which the men made , who were carousing at the bathing-pool .
Parsing [sent. 2176 len. 42]: The idea of parting with Nero also lay heavy upon my heart , though the woman had almost satisfied me that as soon as I was gone , the animal would resume its natural habits , and care nothing for me .
Parsing [sent. 2177 len. 21]: I was up the next morning early , and went down with Nero to obtain the fish which we required .
Parsing [sent. 2178 len. 33]: I left some on the rocks for the seamen 's breakfast -LRB- for they were all sound asleep -RRB- , and then returned to the cabin , and prepared for our own .
Parsing [sent. 2179 len. 42]: Mrs Reichardt , as I shall now call her , soon came out to me , and when breakfast was over , proposed that we should plant the remainder of the potatoes before we packed up the things in the chest .
Parsing [sent. 2180 len. 47]: As soon as they were all cut , we set off to the ravine , and had finished our task before noon , at which time there were but few of the seamen stirring , they had remained up so long the night before , drinking .
Parsing [sent. 2181 len. 33]: The mate was one of those who were on their legs , and he asked me if I thought we should have smooth water to launch the boat on the following day .
Parsing [sent. 2182 len. 37]: I replied in the affirmative , and went with Mrs Reichardt to the cabin , and putting down the shovel , I hauled my chest out on the platform to select what articles I should take .
Parsing [sent. 2183 len. 47]: While we were thus employed , and talking at times , the men came up for the dried birds to take down ready for putting them in the boat on the following day , and in two trips they had cleared out the whole of them .
Parsing [sent. 2184 len. 12]: `` Have you used all the potatoes you brought up ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2185 len. 16]: said one of the men ; `` for we shall be short of provisions . ''
Parsing [sent. 2186 len. 9]: Mrs Reichardt replied that we had none left .
Parsing [sent. 2187 len. 54]: `` Well then , '' said the man , `` the mate says you had better bring down that brute of yours to catch the rest of the fish in the pond , that we may cook them before we start , as they will make two days ' meals at least . ''
Parsing [sent. 2188 len. 16]: `` Very well , '' replied I ; `` I will come down directly . ''
Parsing [sent. 2189 len. 30]: I did so , and Nero , in a quarter of an hour , had landed all the fish , and I then returned with him to the cabin .
Parsing [sent. 2190 len. 27]: Mrs R. had selected the best of the clothes , and made them up in a tight bundle , which she sewed up with strong thread .
Parsing [sent. 2191 len. 25]: My books she had left out , as well as the spy-glass , and the tools I had , as they might be useful .
Parsing [sent. 2192 len. 29]: I asked her whether I should carry them down to the bathing-pool , but she replied that on the morning when we embarked would be quite time enough .
Parsing [sent. 2193 len. 25]: I then went to the hole under Jackson 's bed-place , and brought out the belt and the few articles that were with it .
Parsing [sent. 2194 len. 41]: Mrs R. , after having examined them , said that she would take care of them all ; the watch and other trinkets she put in her basket , the belt she took to the bed-place , and secreted it .
Parsing [sent. 2195 len. 46]: She appeared very silent and thoughtful , and on my asking her whether I should not take down the shovel , and the pail , and hammer , she replied , `` No , leave all till we are ready to go to the boat .
Parsing [sent. 2196 len. 7]: It will be time enough . ''
Parsing [sent. 2197 len. 30]: Shortly afterwards , the mate brought us up some of the fish which they had cooked for supper , and when we had eaten it we went to bed .
Parsing [sent. 2198 len. 30]: `` This is the last night we shall sleep together , Nero , '' said I , kissing my favourite , and the thought brought tears into my eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2199 len. 9]: `` But it ca n't be helped . ''
Parsing [sent. 2200 len. 13]: I was however soon fast asleep with my arm round the animal .
Parsing [sent. 2201 len. 29]: When I went out the next morning , I found that the weather was beautifully fine , the water smooth , and only rippled by a light breeze .
Parsing [sent. 2202 len. 29]: As Mrs R. had not yet made her appearance , I went down to the bathing-pool , where I found all the men up and in full activity .
Parsing [sent. 2203 len. 40]: The boat had been emptied out , the oars , masts , and sails , were on the rocks and the men were turning the bows to the seaward in readiness for launching her over the ledge of rocks .
Parsing [sent. 2204 len. 29]: The dried birds lay in a heap by the side of the cask of rum , and the fish which had been baked were in a large kid .
Parsing [sent. 2205 len. 31]: The six breakers were also piled up together , and the mate and some of the men were disputing as to how many of them should be filled with water .
Parsing [sent. 2206 len. 24]: The mate wanted them all filled ; the men said that three would be sufficient , as the boat would be so loaded .
Parsing [sent. 2207 len. 26]: At last the mate gained his point , and the men each took a breaker , and went up to the cabin for the water .
Parsing [sent. 2208 len. 75]: I went with them to fill the breakers , and also to see that they did no mischief , for they appeared very unruly and out of temper ; and I was afraid that they would hurt Nero , who was at the cabin , if I was not there to prevent them ; but with the exception of examining the cabin , and forcing themselves in upon Mrs Reichardt , they did nothing .
Parsing [sent. 2209 len. 60]: When the breakers were full , which took at least half an hour , they did indeed try to catch the birds , and would have wrung their necks , but the males flew away , and the females I put into the bed-place that was screened off in the cabin , and near which Mrs Reichardt was sitting .
Parsing [sent. 2210 len. 30]: They all appeared to have a great awe and respect for this woman , and a look from her was more effectual than were any words of the mate .
Parsing [sent. 2211 len. 28]: `` We do n't want you , '' said one of the men , as they went down to the bathing-pool with the breakers on their shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 2212 len. 11]: `` Why do n't you keep up with the lady ?
Parsing [sent. 2213 len. 16]: You 're quite a lady 's man , now you 've white trousers on . ''
Parsing [sent. 2214 len. 11]: The others who followed him laughed at this latter remark .
Parsing [sent. 2215 len. 25]: `` I 'm of no use up there , at present , '' said I ; `` and I may be down below . ''
Parsing [sent. 2216 len. 32]: The men set down the breakers on the rocks by the pool , and then , under the directions of the mate , prepared to launch the boat over the ledge .
Parsing [sent. 2217 len. 30]: The masts of the boat were placed athwartships , under her keel , for her to run upon , and being now quite empty , she was very light .
Parsing [sent. 2218 len. 55]: She was what they call a whale-boat , fitted for the whale fishery , pointed at both ends , and steered by an oar ; she was not very large , but held seven people comfortably , and she was remarkably well fitted with sails and masts , having two lugs and a mizen .
Parsing [sent. 2219 len. 31]: As soon as they were all ready , the men went to the side of the boat , and in a minute she was launched into the sea without injury .
Parsing [sent. 2220 len. 53]: The mate said to me , as they brought her broadside to the ledge -- `` Now , my lad , we do n't want you any more ; you may go up to the cabin till we are ready , and then we will send for you and the lady . ''
Parsing [sent. 2221 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 2222 len. 22]: but I can be of use here , '' replied I ; `` and I am of none up there . ''
Parsing [sent. 2223 len. 60]: The mate did not reply , and the men then went to the rum cask , and rolled it towards the boat ; and when they had it on the ledge , they parbuckled it , as they term it , into the boat with a whale-line that they happened to have , and which was of great length .
Parsing [sent. 2224 len. 64]: After the cask of rum was got in amidships , -LRB- and it took up a great deal of space , reaching from one gunnel to the other , and standing high above the thwarts -RRB- they went for the breakers of water , which they put in , three before and three behind the cask , upon the floor of the boat .
Parsing [sent. 2225 len. 21]: `` She will be too heavy , '' said one of the men , `` with so much water . ''
Parsing [sent. 2226 len. 14]: `` We can easily get rid of it , '' replied the mate .
Parsing [sent. 2227 len. 37]: `` If you had said she would be too heavy with so much liquor on board , you had better explained the matter ; however , you must have your own ways , I suppose . ''
Parsing [sent. 2228 len. 13]: The next articles that they brought to stow away were the provisions .
Parsing [sent. 2229 len. 32]: The kid of fish was put amidships on the breakers , and the dried birds , which they carried down in their arms , were packed up neatly in the stern-sheets .
Parsing [sent. 2230 len. 35]: They were soon up to the gunnel , and the mate said , `` You had better stow away forward now -- there will be little room for the lady as it is . ''
Parsing [sent. 2231 len. 31]: `` No , no , stow them all aft , '' replied one of the men , in a surly tone ; `` the lady must sit where she can .
Parsing [sent. 2232 len. 8]: She 's no better than we . ''
Parsing [sent. 2233 len. 7]: `` Shall this go in ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2234 len. 15]: said I , pointing to the coil of whale-line , and addressing the mate .
Parsing [sent. 2235 len. 59]: `` No , no ; we must leave that , '' replied one of the men in the boat ; `` we shall be wedged enough as it is ; and I say , Jim , throw that old saw and the bag of nails out of the boat -- we can have no use for them . ''
Parsing [sent. 2236 len. 34]: The masts were then stepped , and the rigging set up to the gunnel of the boat , the yards and sails handed in , and hooked on the halyards ready for hoisting .
Parsing [sent. 2237 len. 27]: In fact the boat was now all ready for starting ; they had only the iron kettle and two or three other articles to put in .
Parsing [sent. 2238 len. 8]: `` Shall we have the mizen ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2239 len. 17]: inquired one of the men , pointing to the mast , which lay on the rocks .
Parsing [sent. 2240 len. 16]: `` No , she steers quite as well without it , '' replied the mate .
Parsing [sent. 2241 len. 6]: `` We 'll leave it .
Parsing [sent. 2242 len. 11]: And now , lads , hand the oars in . ''
Parsing [sent. 2243 len. 55]: They were brought to the boat , but owing to the puncheon of rum in the centre , they could not lie flat , and after a good deal of arguing and disputing , four oars and a boat-hook were lashed to the gunnel outside , and the rest were left on the rocks .
Parsing [sent. 2244 len. 25]: At this time there was some consultation between the mate and some of the men -- the mate being evidently opposed by the others .
Parsing [sent. 2245 len. 20]: I could not hear what it was about , but the mate appeared very angry and very much annoyed .
Parsing [sent. 2246 len. 25]: At last he dashed his hat down on the rocks in a great passion , saying , `` No good will come of it .
Parsing [sent. 2247 len. 4]: Mark my words .
Parsing [sent. 2248 len. 8]: No good ever did or ever will .
Parsing [sent. 2249 len. 25]: Be it so , you are too many for me ; but I tell you again , no good will come of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2250 len. 26]: The mate then sat down on the rocks by himself , and put his head down on his knees , covering it with his hands .
Parsing [sent. 2251 len. 38]: The man with whom he had been disputing went to the others in the boat , and spoke to them in a low tone , looking round at me , to ascertain if I was within hearing .
Parsing [sent. 2252 len. 29]: After a minute or two they all separated , and then one of them said to me -- `` Now , my lad , we 're all ready .
Parsing [sent. 2253 len. 25]: Go up to the cabin and bring down your bundle and her basket , and tell the lady we are waiting for her . ''
Parsing [sent. 2254 len. 24]: `` There 's the shovel , '' said I , `` and the boat 's sail -- must I bring them down ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2255 len. 22]: `` Oh yes , bring them down , and also two or three sealskins for the lady to sit upon . ''
Parsing [sent. 2256 len. 39]: Off I went on my errand , for I was delighted with the idea of leaving the island , and my patience had been almost exhausted at the time they had taken in the stowage of the boat .
Parsing [sent. 2257 len. 42]: As I hastened up the path , I heard loud contention , and the mate 's voice speaking very angrily , and I stopped for a short time to listen , but the noise ceased , and I went on again .
Parsing [sent. 2258 len. 16]: I found Nero on the platform , and I stopped a minute to caress him .
Parsing [sent. 2259 len. 51]: `` Good bye , my poor Nero , we shall never see one another again , '' said I. `` You must go back to the sea , and catch fish for yourself ; '' and the tears started in my eyes as I gave the animal a farewell kiss .
Parsing [sent. 2260 len. 16]: I then went into the cabin , where I found Mrs Reichardt sitting very quietly .
Parsing [sent. 2261 len. 38]: `` They are all ready , '' said I , `` and have sent me up for you but I am to bring down the boat 's sail and some seal skins for you to sit upon .
Parsing [sent. 2262 len. 11]: I can carry both if you can carry my bundle .
Parsing [sent. 2263 len. 8]: Have you put the belt on ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2264 len. 13]: `` Yes , '' replied she , `` I am quite ready .
Parsing [sent. 2265 len. 50]: I will carry the bundle , and the books and spy-glass , as well as my basket ; but we must pack them close , '' added she , `` and roll the sail up round the yard , or you will not be able to carry it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2266 len. 40]: We took the sail down , and got it ready for carrying , and I rolled up the two best seal skins , and tied them with a piece of fishing line , and then we were all ready .
Parsing [sent. 2267 len. 30]: I shouldered my burden , and Mrs Reichardt took the other articles , as proposed , and we left the cabin to go down the path to the bathing-pool .
Parsing [sent. 2268 len. 58]: `` Good bye , Nero -- good bye , birds -- good bye , cabin -- and good bye , garden , '' said I , as I went along the platform ; and having so done , and ordered Nero back with a tremulous voice , I turned my head in the direction of the bathing-pool .
Parsing [sent. 2269 len. 23]: I stared and then screamed , dropping my burden , as I lifted up my hands in amazement -- `` Look ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2270 len. 6]: cried I to my companion .
Parsing [sent. 2271 len. 4]: `` Look ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2272 len. 5]: repeated I , breathless .
Parsing [sent. 2273 len. 44]: She did look , and saw as I did -- the boat under all sail , half a mile from the pool , staggering under a fresh breeze , which carried her away at the rate of seven or eight miles an hour .
Parsing [sent. 2274 len. 10]: They had left us -- they had deserted us .
Parsing [sent. 2275 len. 11]: I cried out , like a madman , `` Stop !
Parsing [sent. 2276 len. 2]: stop !
Parsing [sent. 2277 len. 3]: stop ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2278 len. 25]: and then , seeing how useless it was , I dashed myself on the rock , and for a minute or two was insensible .
Parsing [sent. 2279 len. 4]: `` Oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2280 len. 13]: groaned I , at last , as I came to my senses .
Parsing [sent. 2281 len. 11]: `` Frank Henniker , '' said a sweet firm voice .
Parsing [sent. 2282 len. 13]: I opened my eyes , and saw Mrs Reichardt standing by me .
Parsing [sent. 2283 len. 20]: `` It is the will of Heaven , and you must submit to it patiently , '' continued she .
Parsing [sent. 2284 len. 9]: `` But so cruel , so treacherous ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2285 len. 9]: replied I , looking at the fast-receding boat .
Parsing [sent. 2286 len. 22]: `` I grant , most cruel , and most treacherous , but we must leave them to the judgment of God .
Parsing [sent. 2287 len. 17]: What can they expect from him in the way of mercy when they have shewn none ?
Parsing [sent. 2288 len. 26]: I tell you candidly , that I think we are better in our present forlorn state upon this rock , than if in that boat .
Parsing [sent. 2289 len. 47]: They have taken with them the seeds of discord , of recklessness , and intemperance , in an attempt which requires the greatest prudence , calmness , and unanimity , and I fear there is little chance of their even being rescued from their dangerous position .
Parsing [sent. 2290 len. 47]: It is my opinion , and I thought so when I first knew they had found the cask , that liquor would prove their ruin , and I say again , that boat will never arrive at its destination , and they will all perish miserably .
Parsing [sent. 2291 len. 26]: It has pleased God that they should leave us here , and depend upon it , it has been so decided for the best . ''
Parsing [sent. 2292 len. 35]: `` But , '' replied I , looking again at the boat , `` I was tired of being here -- I was so anxious to get off -- and now to be left !
Parsing [sent. 2293 len. 17]: And they have taken all our provisions , everything , even the fish in the pool .
Parsing [sent. 2294 len. 5]: We shall starve . ''
Parsing [sent. 2295 len. 27]: `` I hope not , '' replied she , `` and I think not ; but we must exert ourselves , and trust to Heaven . ''
Parsing [sent. 2296 len. 12]: But I could not heed her -- my heart was bursting .
Parsing [sent. 2297 len. 14]: I sobbed , as I sat with my hands covering up my face .
Parsing [sent. 2298 len. 5]: `` All gone ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2299 len. 23]: cried I. `` No one left but you and I. '' `` Yes , '' replied she , `` one more . ''
Parsing [sent. 2300 len. 4]: `` Who ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2301 len. 6]: cried I , looking up .
Parsing [sent. 2302 len. 3]: `` God !
Parsing [sent. 2303 len. 8]: -- who is with us always . ''
Parsing [sent. 2304 len. 19]: Chapter XXIII I heard what she said , but my head was too confused to weigh the words .
Parsing [sent. 2305 len. 8]: I remained silent , where I was .
Parsing [sent. 2306 len. 22]: A few seconds elapsed , and she spoke again : `` Frank Henniker , rise , and listen to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2307 len. 9]: `` We shall starve , '' muttered I .
Parsing [sent. 2308 len. 43]: As I said this , one of the male birds returned from the sea with a large fish , of which Mrs Reichardt took possession , as she had seen me do , and the gannet flew away again to obtain more .
Parsing [sent. 2309 len. 22]: Immediately afterwards , the other two birds returned with fish , which were in a like way secured by my companion .
Parsing [sent. 2310 len. 13]: `` See how unjust and ungrateful you are , '' observed she .
Parsing [sent. 2311 len. 32]: `` Here are the birds feeding us , as the ravens did Elijah in the wilderness , at the very time that you are doubting the goodness and mercy of God .
Parsing [sent. 2312 len. 10]: There is a meal for us provided already . ''
Parsing [sent. 2313 len. 4]: `` My head !
Parsing [sent. 2314 len. 4]: my head ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2315 len. 25]: exclaimed I , `` it is bursting , and there is a heavy weight rolling in it -- I can not see anything . ''
Parsing [sent. 2316 len. 26]: And such was the fact : the excitement had brought on a determination of blood to the head , and my senses were rapidly departing .
Parsing [sent. 2317 len. 45]: Mrs Reichardt knelt by my side , and perceiving that what I had said was the case , went into the cabin and brought out a cloth , which she wetted with water from the spring , and laid across my forehead and temples .
Parsing [sent. 2318 len. 33]: I remained motionless and nearly senseless for half an hour , during which she continued to apply fresh cold water to the cloth , and by degrees I recovered from my stupor .
Parsing [sent. 2319 len. 72]: In the meantime , the weather being so fine and the water smooth , the gannets continued to return with the fish they caught , almost all of which were taken from them by my companion , until she had collected more than a dozen fish , from half a pound to a pound weight , which she put away , so that the birds and seal might not devour them .
Parsing [sent. 2320 len. 37]: I was still in a half dozing state , when the breathing and cold nose of Nero touched my cheek , and the murmurings of my favourite roused me up , and I opened my eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2321 len. 13]: `` I am better now , '' said I to Mrs Reichardt .
Parsing [sent. 2322 len. 8]: `` How kind you have been ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2323 len. 15]: `` Yes , you are better , but still , you must remain quiet .
Parsing [sent. 2324 len. 12]: Do you think that you could walk to your bed-place ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2325 len. 52]: `` I 'll try , '' replied I , and with her assistance I rose up ; but , when I afterwards gained my feet , I should have fallen if she had not supported me ; but , assisted by her , I gained my bed and sank down again .
Parsing [sent. 2326 len. 18]: She raised my head higher , and then applied the linen cloth and cold water as before .
Parsing [sent. 2327 len. 17]: `` Try now , '' said she , `` if you can not go to sleep .
Parsing [sent. 2328 len. 15]: When you awake again , I will have some dinner ready for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2329 len. 8]: I thanked her and shut my eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2330 len. 40]: Nero crawled to my bed-place , and with my hand upon his head , I fell asleep , and remained so till near sunset , when I awoke with very little pain in my head , and much refreshed .
Parsing [sent. 2331 len. 8]: I found Mrs Reichardt by my side .
Parsing [sent. 2332 len. 10]: `` You are better now , '' said she .
Parsing [sent. 2333 len. 7]: `` Can you eat any dinner ?
Parsing [sent. 2334 len. 27]: I must make friends with Nero , for he has been disputing my right to come near your bedside , and his teeth are rather formidable .
Parsing [sent. 2335 len. 22]: However , I gave him the inside of the fish when I cleaned them , and we are better friends already .
Parsing [sent. 2336 len. 6]: There is your dinner . ''
Parsing [sent. 2337 len. 21]: Mrs Reichardt placed before me some of the fish , broiled on the embers , and I ate very heartily .
Parsing [sent. 2338 len. 37]: `` It is very kind of you , '' said I , `` to be working for me , when I ought to be working for you -- but you must not do it again . ''
Parsing [sent. 2339 len. 25]: `` Only my share of the work when you are well , '' replied she ; `` but my share I always shall do .
Parsing [sent. 2340 len. 26]: I can not be idle , and I am strong enough to do a great deal ; but we will talk about that to-morrow morning .
Parsing [sent. 2341 len. 13]: You will be quite well by that time , I hope . ''
Parsing [sent. 2342 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 2343 len. 17]: I feel well now , '' replied I , `` only I am very weak . ''
Parsing [sent. 2344 len. 13]: `` You must put your trust in God , my poor boy .
Parsing [sent. 2345 len. 8]: Do you ever pray to him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2346 len. 16]: `` Yes , I try a little sometimes -- but I do n't know how .
Parsing [sent. 2347 len. 7]: Jackson never taught me that . ''
Parsing [sent. 2348 len. 5]: `` Then I will .
Parsing [sent. 2349 len. 10]: Shall I pray now for both of us ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2350 len. 6]: `` Will God hear you ?
Parsing [sent. 2351 len. 15]: What was it that you said just before I forgot everything this morning ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2352 len. 38]: `` I told you that there was another here besides ourselves , a good and gracious God , who is always with us and always ready to come to our assistance if we call upon him . ''
Parsing [sent. 2353 len. 11]: `` You told me God lived beyond the stars . ''
Parsing [sent. 2354 len. 23]: `` My poor boy , as if he were a God who was afar off and did not attend to our prayers !
Parsing [sent. 2355 len. 6]: Such is not the case .
Parsing [sent. 2356 len. 24]: He is with us always in spirit , listening to all our prayers , and reading every secret thought of our hearts . ''
Parsing [sent. 2357 len. 27]: I was silent for some time , thinking upon what she had told me ; at last I said -- `` Then pray to him . ''
Parsing [sent. 2358 len. 18]: Mrs Reichardt knelt down and prayed in a clear and fervent voice , without hesitation or stop .
Parsing [sent. 2359 len. 34]: She prayed for protection and support in our desolate condition , that we might be supplied with all things needful for our sustenance , and have a happy deliverance from our present position .
Parsing [sent. 2360 len. 41]: She prayed that we might be contented and resigned until it should please him to rescue us -- that we might put our whole trust and confidence in him , and submit without murmuring to whatever might be his will .
Parsing [sent. 2361 len. 21]: She prayed for health and strength , for an increase of faith and gratitude towards him for all his mercies .
Parsing [sent. 2362 len. 28]: She thanked him for our having been preserved by being left on the desolate rock , instead of having left it in the boat with the seamen .
Parsing [sent. 2363 len. 6]: -LRB- This surprised me . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 2364 len. 64]: And then she prayed for me , entreating that she might be the humble instrument of leading me to my Heavenly Father , and that he would be pleased to pour down upon me his Holy Spirit , so that I might , by faith in Christ , be accepted , and become a child of God and an inheritor of eternal bliss .
Parsing [sent. 2365 len. 73]: There was something so novel to me and so beautiful in her fervency of prayer , that the tears came into my eyes , and about a minute after she had finished , I said -- `` I now recollect , at least , I think I do -- for the memory of it is very confused-that my mother used to kneel down by me and pray just as you have done .
Parsing [sent. 2366 len. 11]: Oh , how I wish I had a mother ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2367 len. 31]: `` My child , '' replied she , `` promise me that you will be a good and obedient son , and I will be a mother to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2368 len. 4]: `` Will you ?
Parsing [sent. 2369 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 2370 len. 5]: how kind of you .
Parsing [sent. 2371 len. 22]: Yes , I will be all you wish ; I will work for you day and night if it is necessary .
Parsing [sent. 2372 len. 14]: I will do everything , if you will but be my mother . ''
Parsing [sent. 2373 len. 25]: `` I will do my duty to you as a mother most strictly , '' replied she ; `` so that is agreed upon .
Parsing [sent. 2374 len. 14]: Now , you had better go to sleep , if you can . ''
Parsing [sent. 2375 len. 10]: `` But I must first ask you a question .
Parsing [sent. 2376 len. 21]: Why did you thank God for the seamen having left us here , instead of taking us with them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2377 len. 58]: `` Because the boat was overloaded as it was ; because the men , having liquor , would become careless and desperate , and submit to no control ; and therefore I think there is little or no chance of their ever arriving anywhere safe , but that they will perish miserably in some way or another .
Parsing [sent. 2378 len. 39]: This , I consider , is the probability , unless the Almighty in his mercy should be pleased to come to their assistance , and allow them to fall in with some vessel soon after their departure . ''
Parsing [sent. 2379 len. 25]: `` Do you think , then , that God prevented our going with them on purpose that we might not share their fate ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2380 len. 4]: `` I do !
Parsing [sent. 2381 len. 4]: God regulates everything .
Parsing [sent. 2382 len. 45]: Had it been better for us that we should have gone , he would have permitted it ; but he willed it otherwise , and we must bow to his will with a full faith , that he orders everything for the best . ''
Parsing [sent. 2383 len. 19]: `` And you say that God will give us all that we ask for in our prayers ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2384 len. 71]: `` Yes , if we pray fervently and in faith , and ask it in the name of Jesus Christ ; that is , he will grant all we pray for , that is good for us , but not what is not good for us ; or when we ask anything , we do not know that we are asking what is proper or not -- but he does .
Parsing [sent. 2385 len. 23]: We may ask what would be hurtful to us , and then , in his love for us , he denies it .
Parsing [sent. 2386 len. 76]: For instance , suppose you had been accustomed to pray , you must have prayed God that he would permit you to leave this island in the boat , as you are so anxious to go away ; but supposing that boat is lost , as I imagine it will be , surely it would have been a kindness in God , who knew that it would be lost , not to grant your prayer .
Parsing [sent. 2387 len. 6]: Is it not so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2388 len. 20]: `` Yes , I see now , thank you ; now I will go to sleep -- good-night . ''
Parsing [sent. 2389 len. 45]: Chapter XXIV I awoke the next morning quite recovered from my illness of the day before , and was out of the cabin before Mrs Reichardt , who still remained behind the screen which she had put up after I had gone to sleep .
Parsing [sent. 2390 len. 25]: It was a beautiful morning , the water was smooth , and merely rippled with a light breeze , and the sun shone bright .
Parsing [sent. 2391 len. 6]: I felt well and happy .
Parsing [sent. 2392 len. 38]: I lighted a fire to broil the fish for breakfast , as there was a sufficiency left , and then got my fishing-lines ready to catch some larger fish to reinhabit my pond at the bathing pool .
Parsing [sent. 2393 len. 14]: Mrs Reichardt came out of the cabin and found me playing with Nero .
Parsing [sent. 2394 len. 19]: `` Good morning , dear mother , '' said I , for I felt most kindly towards her .
Parsing [sent. 2395 len. 12]: `` Good morning , my dear boy , '' replied she .
Parsing [sent. 2396 len. 7]: `` Are you quite well ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2397 len. 53]: `` Quite well ; and I have got my lines all ready , for I have been thinking that until the birds come , we must live on fish altogether , and we can only take them in fine weather like this ; so we must not lose such a day . ''
Parsing [sent. 2398 len. 4]: `` Certainly not .
Parsing [sent. 2399 len. 14]: As soon as we have breakfasted , we will go down and fish .
Parsing [sent. 2400 len. 12]: I can fish very well , I am used to it .
Parsing [sent. 2401 len. 21]: We must both work now ; but first go for your Bible , that we may read a little . ''
Parsing [sent. 2402 len. 40]: I did so , and after she had read a chapter she prayed , and I knelt by her side ; then we breakfasted , and as soon as we had breakfasted , we set off to the bathing-pool .
Parsing [sent. 2403 len. 14]: `` Do you know if they left anything behind them , Frank ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2404 len. 43]: `` Yes , '' replied I , `` they left some oars , I believe , and a long line and we have the shovel , and the hammer , and the boat 's small sail , up at the cabin . ''
Parsing [sent. 2405 len. 20]: `` Well , we shall see very soon , '' replied she , as we went down the path .
Parsing [sent. 2406 len. 20]: When we arrived at the bathing-pool , the first thing that met my eyes made me leap with joy .
Parsing [sent. 2407 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 2408 len. 2]: mother !
Parsing [sent. 2409 len. 2]: mother !
Parsing [sent. 2410 len. 39]: they 've left the iron pot ; I did so long for it ; and as I lay awake this morning , I thought that if I prayed for anything , it would be for the iron pot .
Parsing [sent. 2411 len. 24]: I was tired of dried birds , and they ate so different when they were boiled up in the pot with potatoes . ''
Parsing [sent. 2412 len. 33]: `` I am equally glad , Frank , for I do not like victuals uncooked ; but now let us first see what else they have thrown out of the boat . ''
Parsing [sent. 2413 len. 28]: `` Why they have put on shore three of the little casks of water , '' said I ; `` they took them all on board . ''
Parsing [sent. 2414 len. 24]: `` They have so , I suppose , because the boat was too heavy , and they would not part with the liquor .
Parsing [sent. 2415 len. 21]: Foolish men , they will now not have more than six days ' water , and will suffer dreadfully . ''
Parsing [sent. 2416 len. 55]: We then looked round the rocks and found that they had left the iron kettle , three breakers , five oars , and a harpoon and staffs ; a gang-board , a whale line of 200 fathoms , an old saw , a bag of broad-headed nails , and two large pieces of sheet-iron .
Parsing [sent. 2417 len. 25]: `` That saw may be very useful to us , '' said Mrs Reichardt , `` especially as you have files in your chest .
Parsing [sent. 2418 len. 18]: Indeed , if we want them , we may convert one-half of the saw into knives . ''
Parsing [sent. 2419 len. 4]: `` Into knives !
Parsing [sent. 2420 len. 3]: How ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2421 len. 16]: `` I will shew you ; and these pieces of sheet-iron I could use again .
Parsing [sent. 2422 len. 34]: You see the sheet-iron was put on to repair any hole which might be made in the boat , and they have thrown it out , as well as the hammer and nails .
Parsing [sent. 2423 len. 9]: I wonder at John Gough permitting it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2424 len. 26]: `` I heard them quarrelling with him as I came out yesterday to fetch you down ; they would not mind what he said . ''
Parsing [sent. 2425 len. 36]: `` No , or we should not have been left here , '' replied she ; `` John Gough was too good a man to have allowed it , if he could have prevented it .
Parsing [sent. 2426 len. 7]: That sheet-iron will be very useful .
Parsing [sent. 2427 len. 6]: Do you know what for ?
Parsing [sent. 2428 len. 9]: to broil fish on , or anything else .
Parsing [sent. 2429 len. 10]: We must turn up the corners with the hammer .
Parsing [sent. 2430 len. 25]: But now we must lose no more time , but fish all day long , and not think of eating till supper time . ''
Parsing [sent. 2431 len. 33]: Accordingly we threw out our lines , and the fish taking the bait freely , we soon hauled in more than a dozen large fish , which I put into the bathing-pool .
Parsing [sent. 2432 len. 16]: `` What use can we make of that long line which they have left ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2433 len. 29]: `` A good many ; but the best use we can make of it , is to turn it into fishing-lines , when we require new ones . ''
Parsing [sent. 2434 len. 16]: `` But how can we do that , it is so thick and heavy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2435 len. 20]: `` Yes , but I will show you how to unlay it , and then make it up again .
Parsing [sent. 2436 len. 74]: Recollect , Frank , that I have been the wife of a Missionary , and have followed my husband wherever he went ; sometimes we have been well off , sometimes as badly off as you and I are now -- for a Missionary has to go through great dangers , and great hardships , as you would acknowledge if you ever heard my life , or rather that of my husband . ''
Parsing [sent. 2437 len. 10]: `` Wo n't you tell it to me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2438 len. 53]: `` Yes , perhaps I will , some day or another ; but what I wish to point out to you now is , that being his wife , and sharing his danger and privation , I have been often obliged to work hard and to obtain my living as I could .
Parsing [sent. 2439 len. 46]: In England , women do little except in the house , but a Missionary 's wife is obliged to work with the men , and as a man very often , and therefore learns to do many things of which women in general are ignorant .
Parsing [sent. 2440 len. 5]: You understand now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2441 len. 4]: `` Oh yes .
Parsing [sent. 2442 len. 15]: I have thought already that you appear to know more than Jackson did . ''
Parsing [sent. 2443 len. 20]: `` I should think not ; but Jackson was not fond of work I expect , and I am .
Parsing [sent. 2444 len. 93]: And now , Frank , you little thought that when you so tardily went to work the other day to plant potatoes for the benefit of any one that might hereafter come to the island , that you were planting for yourself , and would reap the benefit of your own kind act ; for if you had not assisted , of course I could not have done it by myself : so true it is , that even in this world you are very often rewarded for a good action . ''
Parsing [sent. 2445 len. 8]: `` But are not you always ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2446 len. 29]: `` No , my child , you must not expect that ; but if not rewarded in this world , you will be rewarded in the next . ''
Parsing [sent. 2447 len. 8]: `` I do n't understand that . ''
Parsing [sent. 2448 len. 34]: `` I suppose that you hardly can , but I will explain all that to you , if God spare my life ; but it must be at a more seasonable time . ''
Parsing [sent. 2449 len. 46]: We continued fishing till late in the afternoon , by which time we had taken twenty-eight large fish , about seven to nine pounds ' weight ; Mrs Reichardt then proposed that we should leave off , as we had already provision for a fortnight .
Parsing [sent. 2450 len. 51]: I hauled out one more fish , which she took with her to cook for our supper , and having coiled up my lines , I then commenced , as she had told me to do , carrying up the articles left by the boat 's crew at the bathing-pool .
Parsing [sent. 2451 len. 31]: The first thing I seized upon was the coveted iron kettle ; I was quite overjoyed at the possession of this article , and I had good reason to be .
Parsing [sent. 2452 len. 14]: In my other hand I carried the saw and the bag of nails .
Parsing [sent. 2453 len. 55]: As soon as I had deposited them at the cabin , I went down again , and before supper was ready I had brought up everything except the three breakers of water , which I left where they were , as we did not want them for present use , whatever we might hereafter .
Parsing [sent. 2454 len. 20]: We were both rather tired , and were glad to go to bed after we had taken our supper .
Parsing [sent. 2455 len. 54]: Chapter XXV When we met the following morning , my mother , as I shall in future call her , said to me , `` This will be a busy day , Frank , for we have a great many arrangements to make in the cabin , so that we may be comfortable .
Parsing [sent. 2456 len. 25]: In future the cabin must be kept much more clean and tidy than it is -- but that is my business more than yours .
Parsing [sent. 2457 len. 13]: Let us get our breakfasts , and then we will begin . ''
Parsing [sent. 2458 len. 34]: `` I do n't know what you want me to do , '' replied I ; `` but I will do it if I can , as soon as you tell me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2459 len. 30]: `` My dear boy , a woman requires a portion of the cabin to herself , as it is not the custom for women to live altogether with men .
Parsing [sent. 2460 len. 32]: Now , what I wish is , that the hinder part of the cabin , where you used to stow away your dried birds , should be made over to me .
Parsing [sent. 2461 len. 31]: We have oars with which we can make a division , and then nail up seal skins , so that I may have that part of the cabin to myself .
Parsing [sent. 2462 len. 10]: Now , do you understand what I want ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2463 len. 25]: `` Yes , but the oars are longer than the cabin is wide , '' observed I. `` How shall we manage it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2464 len. 24]: `` We have the old saw , and that will do well enough to cut them off , without its being sharpened . ''
Parsing [sent. 2465 len. 20]: `` I never saw one used , '' replied I , `` and I do n't understand it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2466 len. 7]: `` I will soon show you .
Parsing [sent. 2467 len. 11]: First , we must measure the width of the cabin .
Parsing [sent. 2468 len. 13]: I shall not take away more than one third of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2469 len. 12]: My mother went into the cabin , and I followed her .
Parsing [sent. 2470 len. 27]: With a piece of fishing-line , she took the width of the cabin , and then the height up to the rafters for the door posts .
Parsing [sent. 2471 len. 41]: We then went out , and with the saw , which she showed me how to use , and which astonished me very much , when I perceived its effects , the oars were cut up to the proper length .
Parsing [sent. 2472 len. 40]: Gimlets I had already from the sea-chest , and nails and hammer we had just obtained from the boat , so that before the forenoon was over , the framework was all ready for nailing on the seal skins .
Parsing [sent. 2473 len. 54]: The bag of broad-headed short nails , which had been thrown on the rocks , were excellent for this purpose , and , as I had plenty of skins , the cabin was soon divided off , with a skin between the door-jambs hanging down loose , so that any one might enter .
Parsing [sent. 2474 len. 8]: I went inside after it was complete .
Parsing [sent. 2475 len. 20]: `` But , '' said I , `` you have no light to see what you are about . ''
Parsing [sent. 2476 len. 15]: `` Not yet , but I soon will have , '' replied my mother .
Parsing [sent. 2477 len. 8]: `` Bring the saw here , Frank .
Parsing [sent. 2478 len. 30]: Observe , you must cut through the side of the cabin here , a square hole of this size ; three of the planks cut through will be sufficient .
Parsing [sent. 2479 len. 4]: Begin here . ''
Parsing [sent. 2480 len. 40]: I did as she directed me , and in the course of half an hour , I had cut out of the south side of the cabin a window about two feet square , which admitted plenty of light .
Parsing [sent. 2481 len. 12]: `` But wo n't it make it cold at night ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2482 len. 51]: said I. `` We will prevent that , '' replied she , and she took out a piece of white linen , and with some broad-headed nails , she nailed it up , so as to prevent the air from coming in , although there was still plenty of light .
Parsing [sent. 2483 len. 30]: `` There , '' said she , `` that is but a coarse job , which I will mend bye-and-bye , but it will do for the present . ''
Parsing [sent. 2484 len. 19]: `` Well , it is very nice and comfortable now , '' said I , looking round it .
Parsing [sent. 2485 len. 9]: `` Now what shall I bring in ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2486 len. 13]: `` Nothing for the bed but seal skins , '' said she .
Parsing [sent. 2487 len. 8]: `` I do not like the feathers .
Parsing [sent. 2488 len. 20]: The seal skins are stiff at present , but I think we may be able to soften them bye-and-bye .
Parsing [sent. 2489 len. 38]: Now , Frank , your chest had better come in here , as it is of no use where it is , and we will make a storeroom of it , to hold all our valuables . ''
Parsing [sent. 2490 len. 7]: `` What , the diamonds ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2491 len. 36]: replied I. `` My dear boy , we have articles to put into the chest , which , in our present position , are more valuable to us than all the diamonds in the world .
Parsing [sent. 2492 len. 27]: Tell me now , yourself , what do you prefer and set most value upon , your belt of diamonds , or the iron kettle ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2493 len. 37]: `` The iron kettle , to be sure , '' replied I. `` Exactly so ; and there are many things in our possession as valuable as the iron kettle , as you will hereafter acknowledge .
Parsing [sent. 2494 len. 20]: Now do you go and get ready some fire for us , and I will finish here by myself .
Parsing [sent. 2495 len. 17]: Nero , keep out , sir -- you are never to come into this cabin . ''
Parsing [sent. 2496 len. 22]: I went with Nero for a fish and when I returned , I determined that I would use the iron kettle .
Parsing [sent. 2497 len. 30]: I put it on with water and boiled the fish , and I thought that it ate better than broiled on the embers , which made it too dry .
Parsing [sent. 2498 len. 22]: As we sat at our meal , I said , `` Dear mother , what are we to do next ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2499 len. 29]: `` To-morrow morning we will put the cabin into better order , and put away all our things instead of leaving them about the platform in this way .
Parsing [sent. 2500 len. 20]: Then I will carefully look over all that we have got , and put them away in the chest .
Parsing [sent. 2501 len. 12]: I have not yet seen the contents of the chest . ''
Parsing [sent. 2502 len. 15]: The next day it was very cloudy and , rough weather , blowing fresh .
Parsing [sent. 2503 len. 7]: After breakfast we set to work .
Parsing [sent. 2504 len. 28]: We cleared out the floor of the cabin , which was strewed with all manner of things , for Jackson and I had not been very particular .
Parsing [sent. 2505 len. 26]: The whale line was coiled up and put into one corner , and every thing else was brought in and a place found for it .
Parsing [sent. 2506 len. 41]: `` We must contrive some shelves , '' said my mother , `` that we may put things on them , or else we never can be tidy ; and we have not one except that which holds the books .
Parsing [sent. 2507 len. 7]: I think we can manage it .
Parsing [sent. 2508 len. 71]: We have two oars left besides the boat 's yard ; we will nail them along the side of the cabin , about a foot or more from it , and then we will cut some of the boat 's sail , and nail the canvas from the side of the cabin to the oars , and that will make a sort of shelf which will hold our things . ''
Parsing [sent. 2509 len. 16]: I brought in the oars , they were measured and cut off and nailed up .
Parsing [sent. 2510 len. 42]: The canvas was then stretched from the side of the cabin to the oar , and nailed with the broad-headed nails , and made two capital shelves on each side of the cabin , running from one end to the other .
Parsing [sent. 2511 len. 15]: `` There , '' said my mother , `` that is a good job .
Parsing [sent. 2512 len. 16]: Now we will examine the chest and put everything away and in its place . ''
Parsing [sent. 2513 len. 13]: My mother took out all the clothes , and folded them up .
Parsing [sent. 2514 len. 82]: When she found the roll of duck which was at the bottom , she said -- `` I am glad to find this as I can make a dress for myself much better for this island than this black stuff dress which I now wear , and which I will put by to wear in case we should be taken off the island some of these days , for I must dress like other people when I am again among them .
Parsing [sent. 2515 len. 36]: The clothes are sufficient to last you for a long while , but I shall only alter two shirts and two pair of trousers to your present size , as you will grow very fast .
Parsing [sent. 2516 len. 10]: How old do you think you are now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2517 len. 14]: I replied , `` About sixteen years old , or perhaps more . ''
Parsing [sent. 2518 len. 11]: `` I should think that was about your age . ''
Parsing [sent. 2519 len. 75]: Having examined and folded up every article of clothing in the chest , the tools , spyglass , & c. , were put by me on the shelves , and then we examined the box containing the thread , needles , fishhooks , and other articles , such as buttons , & c. `` These are valuable , '' said she ; `` I have some of my own to put along with them .
Parsing [sent. 2520 len. 23]: Go and fetch my basket , I have not yet had time to look into it since I left the ship . ''
Parsing [sent. 2521 len. 8]: `` What is there in it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2522 len. 11]: `` Except brushes and combs , I can hardly say .
Parsing [sent. 2523 len. 43]: When I travelled about , I always carried my basket , containing those things most requisite for daily use , and in the basket I put everything that I wished to preserve , till I had an opportunity to put it away .
Parsing [sent. 2524 len. 40]: When I embarked on board of the whaler , I brought my basket on my arm as usual , but except opening it for my brushes and combs or scissors , I have not examined it for months . ''
Parsing [sent. 2525 len. 10]: `` What are brushes and combs and scissors ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2526 len. 18]: `` That I will shew you , '' replied she , opening the lid of the basket .
Parsing [sent. 2527 len. 17]: `` These are the brushes and combs for cleaning the hair , and these are scissors .
Parsing [sent. 2528 len. 8]: Now we will take everything out . ''
Parsing [sent. 2529 len. 19]: The basket did indeed appear to contain a wonderful quantity of things , almost all new to me .
Parsing [sent. 2530 len. 104]: There were two brushes , twelve combs , three pair of scissors , a penknife , a little bottle of ink , some pens , a woman 's thimble , a piece of wax , a case of needles , thread and silk , a piece of India ink , and a camel 's - hair brush , sealing-wax , sticking plaster , a box of pills , some tape and bobbin , paper of pins , a magnifying glass , silver pencil case , some money in a purse , black shoe ribbon , and many other articles which I have forgotten .
Parsing [sent. 2531 len. 48]: All I know is that I never was so much interested ever after at any show as I was with the contents of this basket , all of which were explained to me by my mother , as to their uses , and how they were made .
Parsing [sent. 2532 len. 38]: There were several little papers at the bottom of the basket which she said were seeds of plants , which she had collected to take to England with her , and that we would plant them here .
Parsing [sent. 2533 len. 34]: As she shook the dust out of the basket after it was empty , two or three white things tumbled out , which she asked me to pick up and give to her .
Parsing [sent. 2534 len. 85]: `` I do n't know how they came here , '' said she , `` but three of them are orange-pips which we will sow to-morrow , and the other is a pea , but of what kind I know not , we will sow that also -- but I fear it will not come up , as it appears to me to be one of the peas served out to the sailors on board ship , and will be too old to grow .
Parsing [sent. 2535 len. 5]: We can but try .
Parsing [sent. 2536 len. 46]: Now we will put into the chest , with the other things that you have , what we do not want for present use , and then I can drive a nail into the side of my bedroom and hang my basket on it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2537 len. 18]: `` But , '' said I , `` this round glass -- what is that for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2538 len. 63]: `` Put it on one side , '' replied she , `` and to-morrow , if it is fine , I will shew you the use of it ; but there are some things we have forgotten , which are your belt and the other articles you gave me to take for you when you thought we were to leave the island .
Parsing [sent. 2539 len. 10]: They are in the bed-place opposite to yours . ''
Parsing [sent. 2540 len. 37]: I brought them , and she put away the mate 's watch and sleeve buttons , and the other trinkets , & c. , saying that she would examine the letters and papers at another time .
Parsing [sent. 2541 len. 52]: The belt was examined , counting how many of the squares had stones in them , and then , with her scissors , she cut open one of the squares , and took out a white glittering thing like glass as it appeared to me , and looked at it carefully .
Parsing [sent. 2542 len. 25]: `` I am no great judge of these things , '' said she , `` but still I have picked up some little knowledge .
Parsing [sent. 2543 len. 33]: This belt , if it contain all stones like this , must be of considerable value ; now I must get out my needle and thread and sew it up again . ''
Parsing [sent. 2544 len. 16]: She did , and put the belt away with the other articles in the chest .
Parsing [sent. 2545 len. 29]: `` And now , '' said she , `` we have done a good day 's work , and it is time to have something to eat . ''
Parsing [sent. 2546 len. 38]: Chapter XXVI I must say that I was much better pleased with the appearance of the cabin , it was so neat and clean to what it had been , and everything was out of the way .
Parsing [sent. 2547 len. 17]: The next day was a calm and clear day , and we went down to fish .
Parsing [sent. 2548 len. 29]: We were fortunate , and procured almost as many as we had done at the previous fishing -- they were all put in the bathing pool as before .
Parsing [sent. 2549 len. 49]: When we went up to the cabin , as soon as the fish was put on the fire , under the direction of my mother , I turned up the sides of one of the pieces of sheet iron , so as to make a sort of dish .
Parsing [sent. 2550 len. 41]: The other piece I did the same to , only not so high at the sides , as one piece was kept for baking the fish on and the other as a dish to put our dinner upon when cooked .
Parsing [sent. 2551 len. 31]: That day we had been too busy with fishing to think of anything else , but on the following I recollected the magnifying glass , and brought it to her .
Parsing [sent. 2552 len. 60]: She first showed me the power it had to magnify , with which I was much amused for a time , and she explained as well as she could to me the cause of its having that power , but I could not well understand her ; I was more pleased with the effect than cognisant of the cause .
Parsing [sent. 2553 len. 43]: Afterwards she sent me to the cabin for some of the dried moss which I used for tinder , and placing the glass so as to concentrate the rays of the sun , to my astonishment I saw the tinder caught fire .
Parsing [sent. 2554 len. 19]: It was amazement more than astonishment , and I looked up to see where the fire came from .
Parsing [sent. 2555 len. 33]: My mother explained to me , and I , to a certain degree , comprehended , but I was too anxious to have the glass in my own hands and try experiments .
Parsing [sent. 2556 len. 42]: I lighted the tinder again-then I burnt my hand -- then I singed one of the gannet 's heads , and lastly , perceiving that Nero was fast asleep in the sun , I obtained the focus on his cold nose .
Parsing [sent. 2557 len. 24]: He started up with a growl , which made me retreat , and I was perfectly satisfied with the result of my experiments .
Parsing [sent. 2558 len. 27]: From that time , the fire was , when the sun shone , invariably lighted by the burning-glass , and very useful did I find it .
Parsing [sent. 2559 len. 36]: As it was so portable , I always carried it with me , and when I had nothing to do , I magnified , or set fire , according to the humour of the moment .
Parsing [sent. 2560 len. 24]: Although I have not mentioned it , not a morning rose , but before breakfast , I read the Scriptures to my mother .
Parsing [sent. 2561 len. 21]: `` There 's so much in that book which I can not understand , '' said I , one morning .
Parsing [sent. 2562 len. 41]: `` I suspect that , living as you have , alone on this island , and having seen nothing of the world , '' replied my mother , `` that there are not many books that you would understand . ''
Parsing [sent. 2563 len. 42]: `` But I understand all that is said in the Beast and Bird Book , '' replied I. `` Perhaps you may , or think you do ; but , Frank , you must not class the Bible with other books .
Parsing [sent. 2564 len. 18]: The other books are the works of man , but the Bible is the word of God .
Parsing [sent. 2565 len. 38]: There are many portions of that book which the cleverest men , who have devoted their lives to its study , can not understand , and which never will be understood as long as this world endures .
Parsing [sent. 2566 len. 11]: In many parts the Bible is a sealed book . ''
Parsing [sent. 2567 len. 12]: `` But will it never be understood then by anybody ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2568 len. 69]: `` There is quite as much of the Bible as is necessary for men to follow its precepts , and this is so clear that anybody may understand it -- it contains all that is necessary for salvation ; but there are passages , the true meaning of which we can not explain , and which God , for his own purposes , will not permit us to .
Parsing [sent. 2569 len. 31]: But if we do not know them now , we shall probably hereafter , when we have left this world , and our intellects more nearly approach God 's . ''
Parsing [sent. 2570 len. 15]: `` Well , I do n't understand why we should not understand it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2571 len. 16]: `` Frank , '' replied she , `` look at that flower just in bloom .
Parsing [sent. 2572 len. 25]: Do you understand how it is that that plant keeps alive -- grows every year -- every year throws out a large blue flower ?
Parsing [sent. 2573 len. 6]: Why should it do so ?
Parsing [sent. 2574 len. 8]: why should the flower always be blue ?
Parsing [sent. 2575 len. 7]: and whence comes that beautiful colour ?
Parsing [sent. 2576 len. 5]: Can you tell me ?
Parsing [sent. 2577 len. 23]: You see , you know that it does do so ; but can you tell me what makes it do so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2578 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 2579 len. 6]: `` Look at that bird .
Parsing [sent. 2580 len. 9]: You know it is hatched from an egg .
Parsing [sent. 2581 len. 15]: How is it that the inside of an egg is changed into a bird ?
Parsing [sent. 2582 len. 18]: How is it that the bird is covered with feathers , and has the power to fly ?
Parsing [sent. 2583 len. 7]: Can you explain to me yourself ?
Parsing [sent. 2584 len. 35]: You can walk about just as you please -- you have the power of reasoning , and thinking , and of acting ; but by what means is it that you possess that power ?
Parsing [sent. 2585 len. 4]: Can you tell ?
Parsing [sent. 2586 len. 12]: You know that is so , but you know no more .
Parsing [sent. 2587 len. 18]: You ca n't tell why or how or what causes produce these effects -- can you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2588 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 2589 len. 78]: `` Well , then , if you are surrounded by all manner of things , living and dead , and see every day things which you can not explain , or understand , why should you be surprised that , as God has not let you know by what means these effects are produced , that in his written word he should also keep from you that which for good purposes you are not permitted to know .
Parsing [sent. 2590 len. 16]: Everything here is by God 's will , and that must be sufficient for us .
Parsing [sent. 2591 len. 6]: Now do you understand ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2592 len. 19]: `` Yes , I see now what you mean , but I never thought about these things before .
Parsing [sent. 2593 len. 9]: Tell me some more about the Bible . ''
Parsing [sent. 2594 len. 4]: `` Not now .
Parsing [sent. 2595 len. 34]: Some day I will give you a history of the Bible , and then you will understand the nature of the book , and why it was written ; but not at present .
Parsing [sent. 2596 len. 31]: Suppose , as we have nothing particular to do , you tell me all you know about yourself from Jackson , and all that happened while you lived with him .
Parsing [sent. 2597 len. 15]: I have heard only part , and I should like to know all . ''
Parsing [sent. 2598 len. 23]: `` Very well , '' replied I. `` I will tell you everything , but it will take a long while . ''
Parsing [sent. 2599 len. 34]: `` We shall have plenty of time to spare , my dear boy , I fear , before we leave this place ; so , never mind time -- tell me everything . ''
Parsing [sent. 2600 len. 10]: I commenced my narrative , but I was interrupted .
Parsing [sent. 2601 len. 16]: `` Have you never been able to call your own mother to your memory ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2602 len. 3]: said she .
Parsing [sent. 2603 len. 19]: `` I think I can now , since I have seen you , but I could not before .
Parsing [sent. 2604 len. 41]: I now can recollect a person dressed like you , kneeling down and praying by my side ; and I said before , the figure has appeared in my dreams , and much oftener since you have been here . ''
Parsing [sent. 2605 len. 6]: `` And your father ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2606 len. 18]: `` I have not the slightest remembrance of him , or anybody else except my mother . ''
Parsing [sent. 2607 len. 44]: I then proceeded , and continued my narrative until it was time to go to bed ; but as I was very circumstantial , and was often interrupted by questions , I had not told a quarter of what I had to say .
Parsing [sent. 2608 len. 51]: Chapter XXVII Mrs Reichardt had promised to give me a history of the Bible ; and one day , when the weather kept us both at home , she thus commenced her narrative : -- `` The Bible is a history of God 's doings for the salvation of man .
Parsing [sent. 2609 len. 20]: It commences with the fall of man by disobedience , and ends with the sacrifice made for his reinstatement .
Parsing [sent. 2610 len. 27]: As by one man , Adam , sin came into the world , so by one man , Jesus Christ , was sin and death overcome .
Parsing [sent. 2611 len. 52]: If you will refer to the third chapter of Genesis , at the very commencement of the Bible , you will find that at the same time that Adam receives his punishment , a promise is made by the Lord , that the head of the serpent shall hereafter be bruised .
Parsing [sent. 2612 len. 43]: The whole of the Bible , from the very commencement , is an announcement of the coming of Christ ; so that as soon as the fault had been committed , the Almighty , in his mercy , had provided a remedy .
Parsing [sent. 2613 len. 8]: Nothing is unknown or unforeseen by God .
Parsing [sent. 2614 len. 29]: `` Recollect , Frank , that the Bible contains the history of God 's doings , but it does not often tell us why such things were done .
Parsing [sent. 2615 len. 42]: It must be sufficient for us to know that such was the will of God ; when he thinks proper , he allows us to understand his ways , but to our limited capacities , most of his doings are inscrutable .
Parsing [sent. 2616 len. 29]: But , are we to suppose that , because we , in our foolishness , can not comprehend his reasons , that therefore they must be cavilled at ?
Parsing [sent. 2617 len. 8]: Do you understand me , Frank ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2618 len. 14]: `` Yes , '' replied I ; `` I do pretty well . ''
Parsing [sent. 2619 len. 34]: `` As I pointed out to you the other day , you see the blade of grass grow , and you see it flower , but how it does so you know not .
Parsing [sent. 2620 len. 45]: If then you are surrounded all your life with innumerable things which you see but can not comprehend -- when all nature is a mystery to you -- even yourself -- how can you expect to understand the dealings of God in other things ?
Parsing [sent. 2621 len. 17]: When , therefore , you read the Bible , you must read it with faith . ''
Parsing [sent. 2622 len. 5]: `` What is faith ?
Parsing [sent. 2623 len. 9]: I do n't quite understand , mother . ''
Parsing [sent. 2624 len. 24]: `` Frank , I have often told you of many things that are in England , where you one day hope to go .
Parsing [sent. 2625 len. 34]: Now , if when you arrive in England , you find that everything that I have told you is quite true , you will be satisfied that I am worthy of belief . ''
Parsing [sent. 2626 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 2627 len. 76]: `` Well , suppose some one were to tell you something relative to any other country , which you could not understand , and you came to me and asked me if such were the case , would you , having found that I told you truth with regard to England , believe that what you had been told of this other country was true , if I positively asserted that it was so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2628 len. 9]: `` Of course I should , mother . ''
Parsing [sent. 2629 len. 28]: `` Well , then , Frank , that would be faith ; a belief in things not only not seen , but which you can not understand .
Parsing [sent. 2630 len. 74]: But to go on , I mention this because some people are so presumptuous as to ask the why and the wherefore of God 's doings , and attempt to argue upon their justice , forgetting that the little reason they have is the gift of God , and that they must be endowed with intellect equal to the Almighty , to enable them to know and perceive that which he decides upon .
Parsing [sent. 2631 len. 56]: But if God has not permitted us to understand all his ways , still , wherever we can trace the finger of God , we can always perceive that everything is directed by an all-wise and beneficent hand ; and that , although the causes appear simple , the effects produced are extraordinary and wonderful .
Parsing [sent. 2632 len. 18]: We shall observe this as we talk over the history of the Jews , in the Bible .
Parsing [sent. 2633 len. 31]: But , I repeat , that we must study the whole of the Bible with faith , and not be continually asking ourselves , ` Why was this done ? '
Parsing [sent. 2634 len. 43]: If you will turn to the ninth chapter of the Epistle to the Romans , you will see what the Apostle Paul says on the subject : ` Nay but , O man , who art thou that repliest against God ? '
Parsing [sent. 2635 len. 20]: Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it , ` Why hast thou made me thus ? '
Parsing [sent. 2636 len. 14]: Do you not understand in what spirit the Bible should be read ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2637 len. 6]: `` Yes , I do .
Parsing [sent. 2638 len. 20]: We must read it as the Word of God , and believe all that we read in it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2639 len. 9]: `` Exactly ; -- now we will proceed .
Parsing [sent. 2640 len. 47]: After Adam 's fall , the earth became so wicked that God destroyed it , leaving but Noah and his family to re-people it ; and as soon as this was done , the Almighty prepared for his original intention for the future salvation of men .
Parsing [sent. 2641 len. 34]: He selected Abraham , who was a good man , and who had faith , to be the father of a nation chosen for his own people -- that was the Jewish nation .
Parsing [sent. 2642 len. 49]: He told him that his seed should multiply as the stars in the heavens , and that all the nations of the earth should be blessed in him ; that is , that from his descendants should Christ be born , who should be the salvation of men .
Parsing [sent. 2643 len. 17]: Abraham 's great-grandchildren were brought into Egypt , to live apart in the land of Goshen .
Parsing [sent. 2644 len. 12]: You have read the history of Joseph and his brethren ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2645 len. 10]: `` Oh yes ; I know that well . ''
Parsing [sent. 2646 len. 26]: `` Well , the Almighty wished the Jews should be a nation apart from others , and for that purpose he brought them into Egypt .
Parsing [sent. 2647 len. 15]: But observe , Frank , by what simple and natural causes this was effected .
Parsing [sent. 2648 len. 38]: It was by a dream of Joseph 's , which , when he told them of it , irritated his brothers against him ; they sold him as a slave , and he was sent into Egypt .
Parsing [sent. 2649 len. 31]: There , having explained the dream of Pharaoh , he was made a ruler over Egypt , and saved that country from the famine which was in every other land .
Parsing [sent. 2650 len. 13]: His brothers come down to buy corn , and he recognises them .
Parsing [sent. 2651 len. 27]: He sends for his father and all the family , and establishes them in the land of Goshen , as shepherds , apart from the Egyptians .
Parsing [sent. 2652 len. 46]: Here they multiplied fast ; but after Joseph 's elevation they were cruelly treated by the Egyptians , who became afraid of their rapid increase , and eventually the Kings of Egypt gave orders that all the male children of the Jews should be destroyed .
Parsing [sent. 2653 len. 26]: It was at this time , when they were so oppressed and cruelly treated by the Egyptians , that God interfered and sent for Moses .
Parsing [sent. 2654 len. 35]: Moses , like all the rest of the Jews , knew nothing of the true God , and was difficult to persuade , and it was only by miracles that he was convinced . ''
Parsing [sent. 2655 len. 20]: `` Why did God keep the Jews apart from the Egyptians , and have them thrown in bondage ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2656 len. 14]: `` Because he wished to prepare them to become his own peculiar people .
Parsing [sent. 2657 len. 40]: By their being descended from Abraham , and having never intermarried with other nations , they had become a pure race ; by being in bondage and severely treated , they had suffered and become united as a people .
Parsing [sent. 2658 len. 33]: They knew no Gods but those worshipped by the Egyptians , and these Gods it was now the intention of the Almighty to confound , and prove to the Jews as worthless .
Parsing [sent. 2659 len. 56]: At the same time he worked with his own nation in mystery , for when Moses asked him what God he was to tell his people that he was , the Almighty only replied by these words -- _ I am _ ; having no name like all the false Gods worshipped by the Egyptians .
Parsing [sent. 2660 len. 22]: He was now about to prove , by his wonderful miracles , the difference between himself and the false Gods . ''
Parsing [sent. 2661 len. 6]: `` What are miracles ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2662 len. 53]: `` A miracle is doing that which man has no power of doing , proving that the party who does it is superior to man : for instance -- to restore a dead man to life is a miracle , as none but God , or those empowered by God could do .
Parsing [sent. 2663 len. 54]: Miracles were necessary , therefore , to prove to the Jews that the Almighty was the true God , and were resorted to by him in this instance , as well as in the coming of Our Saviour , when it was also necessary to prove that he was the Son of God .
Parsing [sent. 2664 len. 36]: When the Almighty sent Moses to Pharaoh to demand that the Israelites should have permission to sacrifice in the desert , he purposely hardened the heart of Pharaoh that he might refuse the request . ''
Parsing [sent. 2665 len. 8]: `` But why did he so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2666 len. 57]: `` Because he wanted to prove to the Israelites that he was the only true God and had Pharaoh consented to their going away , there would have been no opportunity of performing those miracles by which the Israelites were to be delivered , and by which they were to acknowledge him as their God . ''
Parsing [sent. 2667 len. 15]: Mrs Reichardt often renewed this conversation , till I became acquainted with Scriptural History .
Parsing [sent. 2668 len. 21]: Chapter XXVIII The following morning , I went with Nero to take a couple of fish out of the pool .
Parsing [sent. 2669 len. 61]: As soon as Nero had caught them , he went into the other part of the bathing pool to amuse himself , while I cleaned the fish , which I generally did before I went up to the cabin , giving him the heads and insides for his share , if I did not require any portion for the birds .
Parsing [sent. 2670 len. 48]: Nero was full of play that morning , and when I threw the heads to him , as he frolicked in the water , he brought them out to the rocks , but instead of eating them , as usual , he laid them at my feet .
Parsing [sent. 2671 len. 28]: I threw them in several times , and he continued to bring them out , and my mother , coming down to me , was watching him .
Parsing [sent. 2672 len. 23]: `` I think , '' said she , `` you must teach Nero to fetch and carry like a dog -- try .
Parsing [sent. 2673 len. 22]: Instead of the heads , throw in this piece of wood ; '' which she now broke off the boat-hook staff .
Parsing [sent. 2674 len. 20]: I did so , and Nero brought it out , as he had done the heads of the fish .
Parsing [sent. 2675 len. 16]: I patted and coaxed the animal , and tried him again several times with success .
Parsing [sent. 2676 len. 23]: `` Now , '' said my mother , `` you must accustom him to certain words when you send him for anything .
Parsing [sent. 2677 len. 10]: Always say , ` Fetch it , Nero ! '
Parsing [sent. 2678 len. 7]: and point with your finger . ''
Parsing [sent. 2679 len. 11]: `` Why am I to do that , mother ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2680 len. 3]: I asked .
Parsing [sent. 2681 len. 36]: `` Because the object to be gained is , not that the animal should fetch out what you throw in , but what you send it to bring out which you have not thrown in .
Parsing [sent. 2682 len. 5]: Do you understand ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2683 len. 27]: `` Yes , '' replied I. `` You mean if there were anything floating near on the sea , I should send him for it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2684 len. 3]: `` Exactly .
Parsing [sent. 2685 len. 9]: Then Nero would be of some use . ''
Parsing [sent. 2686 len. 26]: `` I will soon teach him , '' replied I ; `` to-morrow I will send him into the sea after the piece of spar .
Parsing [sent. 2687 len. 12]: I 've no fear that he will go away now . ''
Parsing [sent. 2688 len. 22]: `` I was thinking last night , Frank , whether they had taken the pail with them in the boat . ''
Parsing [sent. 2689 len. 21]: `` The pail , '' said I ; `` I know where it is , but I quite forgot it .
Parsing [sent. 2690 len. 15]: We left it up the ravine the last day we planted the potatoes . ''
Parsing [sent. 2691 len. 9]: `` We did so , now I recollect .
Parsing [sent. 2692 len. 13]: I will go for it while you get the breakfast ready . ''
Parsing [sent. 2693 len. 42]: We had now been for many weeks on a fish diet , and I must confess that I was tired of it , which was not the case when I lived upon the dried birds during the whole of the year .
Parsing [sent. 2694 len. 23]: Why so I can not tell , but I was soon to learn to relish fish , if I could obtain them .
Parsing [sent. 2695 len. 64]: It was not often that the wind blew direct on the shore , but coming from the northward and eastward , it was in a slanting direction , but occasionally , and chiefly about the time of the Equinoxes , the gales came on very heavy from the eastward , and then the wash of the seas upon the rocky coast was tremendous .
Parsing [sent. 2696 len. 8]: Such was the case about this time .
Parsing [sent. 2697 len. 37]: A fierce gale of wind from the eastward raised a sea which threw the surf and spray high over the loftiest of the rocks , and the violence of the wind bore the spray far inland .
Parsing [sent. 2698 len. 56]: The gale had come on in the evening , and my mother and I , when we rose in the morning , were standing on the platform before the cabin , admiring the grandeur of the scene , but without the least idea that it was to be productive of so much misery to ourselves .
Parsing [sent. 2699 len. 47]: My mother pointed out to me some passages in the Psalms and Old Testament bearing strongly upon the scene before us ; after a time I called Nero , and went down with him to take fish out of the pool for our day 's consumption .
Parsing [sent. 2700 len. 20]: At that time we had a large supply in the pool -- more than ever , I should say .
Parsing [sent. 2701 len. 86]: When I arrived at the pool , I found the waves several feet in height rolling in over the ledges , and the pool one mass of foam , the water in it being at least two or three feet higher than usual ; still it never occurred to me that there was any mischief done , until I had sent Nero in for the fish , and found that , after floundering and diving for some time , he did not bring out one .
Parsing [sent. 2702 len. 12]: My mind misgave me , and I ordered him in again .
Parsing [sent. 2703 len. 71]: He remained some time and then returned without a fish , and I was then satisfied that from the rolling in of the waves , and the unusual quantity of the water in the pool , the whole of the fish had escaped , and that we were now without any provisions or means of subsistence , until the weather should settle , and enable us to catch some more .
Parsing [sent. 2704 len. 24]: Aghast at the discovery , I ran up to the cabin , and called to my mother , who was in her bedroom .
Parsing [sent. 2705 len. 22]: `` Oh , mother , all the fish have got out of the pool , and we have nothing to eat .
Parsing [sent. 2706 len. 9]: I told you we should be starved . ''
Parsing [sent. 2707 len. 38]: `` Take time , Frank , and take breath , '' replied she , `` and then tell me what has happened , to cause this alarm and dismay , that you appear to be in . ''
Parsing [sent. 2708 len. 17]: I explained to her what had happened , and that Nero could not find one fish .
Parsing [sent. 2709 len. 25]: `` I fear that what you say must be correct , '' replied she ; `` but we must put our trust in God .
Parsing [sent. 2710 len. 14]: It is his will , and whatever he wills must be right . ''
Parsing [sent. 2711 len. 43]: I can not say I was Christian enough at the time to acknowledge the truth of her reply , and I answered , `` If God is as good and as gracious as you say , will he allow us to starve ?
Parsing [sent. 2712 len. 9]: Does he know that we are starving ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2713 len. 10]: continued I. `` Does he know , Frank ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2714 len. 35]: replied my mother ; `` what does the Bible say -- that not a sparrow falls to the ground without his knowledge ; and of how much more worth are you than many sparrows ?
Parsing [sent. 2715 len. 7]: Shame upon you , Frank ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2716 len. 22]: I was abashed but not satisfied , I therefore replied quietly , `` We have nothing to eat , mother . ''
Parsing [sent. 2717 len. 53]: `` Granted that we have lost all our fish , Frank , still we are not yet starving ; the weather may moderate tomorrow , and we may catch some more , or even if it should not till the day afterwards , we can bear to be two days without food .
Parsing [sent. 2718 len. 25]: Let us hope for the best and put our trust in God -- let us pray to him and ask him for his assistance .
Parsing [sent. 2719 len. 32]: He can rebuke these stormy waters -- he can always find means of helping those who put confidence in him , and will send us aid when all hope appears gone .
Parsing [sent. 2720 len. 31]: Pray , Frank , as I will do , fervently , and believing that your prayer is heard -- pray with faith , and your prayer will be answered . ''
Parsing [sent. 2721 len. 26]: `` It is not always so , '' replied I ; `` you have told me of many people who have died of starvation . ''
Parsing [sent. 2722 len. 41]: `` I grant it , and for all wise purposes they were permitted so to do , but the Almighty had reasons for permitting it , unknown to us , but which you may depend upon it , were good .
Parsing [sent. 2723 len. 7]: We can not fathom his decrees .
Parsing [sent. 2724 len. 62]: He may even now decide that such is to be our fate ; but if so , depend upon it , Frank , all is right , and what appears to you now as cruel and neglectful of you , would , if the future could be looked into by us , prove to have been an act of mercy . ''
Parsing [sent. 2725 len. 13]: `` Do you think , then , that we shall starve ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2726 len. 45]: `` I do not -- I have too much faith in God 's mercy , and I do not think that he would have preserved our lives by preventing the men from taking us into the boat , if we were now to starve .
Parsing [sent. 2727 len. 49]: God is not inconsistent ; and I feel assured that , forlorn as our present position appears to be , and tried as our faith in him may be , we shall still be preserved , and live to be monuments of his gracious love and kindness . ''
Parsing [sent. 2728 len. 19]: These words of my mother and the implicit confidence which she appeared to have , much revived me .
Parsing [sent. 2729 len. 72]: `` Well , '' said I , `` I hope you are right , my dear mother , and now I think of it , '' continued I , brightening up at the idea , `` if the worst come to the worst , we can eat the birds ; I do n't care much for them now , and if I did , you should not starve , mother . ''
Parsing [sent. 2730 len. 25]: `` I believe you would not hesitate to sacrifice the birds , Frank , but a greater sacrifice may be demanded of you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2731 len. 4]: `` What ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2732 len. 23]: inquired I ; and then after a little thought , I said , `` You do n't mean Nero , mother ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2733 len. 30]: `` To tell the truth , I did mean Nero , Frank , for the birds will not be a support for more than a day or two . ''
Parsing [sent. 2734 len. 60]: `` I never could kill Nero , mother , '' replied I gloomily , and walking away into the cabin , I sat down very melancholy at the idea of my favourite being sacrificed ; to me it appeared quite horrible , and my mother having referred to it , made her fall very much in my good opinion .
Parsing [sent. 2735 len. 2]: Alas !
Parsing [sent. 2736 len. 20]: I was indeed young and foolish , and little thought what a change would take place in my feelings .
Parsing [sent. 2737 len. 62]: As for the birds , as I really did not care for them , I resolved to kill two of them for our day 's meal , and returning to the platform I had laid hold of the two that were there and had seized both by the neck , when my mother asked me what I was going to do .
Parsing [sent. 2738 len. 22]: `` Kill them , and put them in the pot for our dinner , '' replied I. `` Nay , Frank !
Parsing [sent. 2739 len. 5]: you are too hasty .
Parsing [sent. 2740 len. 13]: Let us make some little sacrifice , even for the poor birds .
Parsing [sent. 2741 len. 11]: We surely can fast one day without very great suffering .
Parsing [sent. 2742 len. 7]: To-morrow will be time enough . ''
Parsing [sent. 2743 len. 14]: I dropped the birds from my hand , tacitly consenting to her proposal .
Parsing [sent. 2744 len. 35]: It was not , however , for the sake of the birds that I did so , but because one day 's respite for the birds would be a day 's respite for Nero .
Parsing [sent. 2745 len. 20]: `` Come , '' said my mother , `` let us go into the cabin and get some work .
Parsing [sent. 2746 len. 10]: I will alter some of the clothes for you .
Parsing [sent. 2747 len. 6]: What will you do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2748 len. 21]: `` I do n't know , '' replied I , `` but I will do whatever you tell me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2749 len. 103]: `` Well , then , I perceive that the two fishing-lines are much worn , and they may break very soon , and then we shall be without the means of taking fish , even if the weather is fine , so now we will cut off some of the whale line , and when it is unravelled , I will show you how to lay it up again into fishing line ; and , perhaps , instead of altering the clothes , I had better help you , as fishing-lines are now of more consequence to us than anything else . ''
Parsing [sent. 2750 len. 10]: This was an arrangement which I gladly consented to .
Parsing [sent. 2751 len. 33]: In a short time the whale line was unravelled , and my mother showed me how to lay it up in three yarns , so as to make a stout fishing line .
Parsing [sent. 2752 len. 17]: She assisted , and the time passed away more rapidly than I had expected it would .
Parsing [sent. 2753 len. 56]: `` You are very clever , mother , '' said I. `` No , my child , I am not , but I certainly do know many things which women in general are not acquainted with ; but the reason of this is , I have lived a life of wandering , and occasional hardships .
Parsing [sent. 2754 len. 64]: Often left to our own resources , when my husband and I were among strangers , we found the necessity of learning to do many things for ourselves , which those who have money usually employ others to do for them ; but I have been in situations where even money was of no use , and had to trust entirely to myself .
Parsing [sent. 2755 len. 58]: I have therefore always made it a rule to learn everything that I could ; and as I have passed much of my life in sailing over the deep waters , I obtained much useful knowledge from the seamen , and this of laying up fishing lines is one of the arts which they communicated to me .
Parsing [sent. 2756 len. 13]: Now , you see , I reap the advantage of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2757 len. 24]: `` Yes , '' replied I ; `` and so do I. How lucky it was that you came to this island ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2758 len. 12]: `` Lucky for me , do you mean , Frank ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2759 len. 5]: `` No , mother !
Parsing [sent. 2760 len. 8]: I mean how lucky for me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2761 len. 28]: `` I trust that I have been sent here to be useful , Frank , and with that feeling I cheerfully submit to the will of God .
Parsing [sent. 2762 len. 46]: He has sent me that I may be useful to you , I do not doubt ; and if by my means you are drawn towards him , and , eventually , become one of his children , I shall have fulfilled my mission . ''
Parsing [sent. 2763 len. 11]: `` I do not understand you quite , mother . ''
Parsing [sent. 2764 len. 62]: `` No , you can not as yet , but everything in season , '' replied she , slowly musing ; '' ` First the blade , then the ear , and then the full corn in the ear , ' '' `` Mother , '' said I , `` I should like to hear the whole story of your life .
Parsing [sent. 2765 len. 13]: You know I have told you all that I know about myself .
Parsing [sent. 2766 len. 14]: Now suppose you tell me your history , and that of your husband .
Parsing [sent. 2767 len. 11]: You did say that perhaps , one day you would .
Parsing [sent. 2768 len. 5]: Do you recollect ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2769 len. 54]: `` Yes , I do recollect that I did make a sort of promise , Frank , and I promise you now that some day I will fulfil it ; but I am not sure that you will understand or profit by the history now , so much as you may bye-and-bye . ''
Parsing [sent. 2770 len. 45]: `` Well , but mother , you can tell me the story twice , and I shall be glad to hear it again , so tell it to me now , to amuse me , and bye-and-bye that I may profit by it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2771 len. 59]: My mother smiled , which she very seldom did , and said -- `` Well , Frank , as I know you would at any time give up your dinner to listen to a story , and as you will have no dinner to-day , I think it is but fair that I should consent to your wish .
Parsing [sent. 2772 len. 14]: Who shall I begin with -- with my husband or with myself ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2773 len. 44]: `` Pray begin with your own history , '' replied I. Chapter XXIX `` I am the daughter of a parish clerk in a small market town near the southern coast of England , within a few miles of a large seaport . ''
Parsing [sent. 2774 len. 8]: `` What is a parish clerk ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2775 len. 14]: I asked , interrupting my mother at the commencement of her promised narrative .
Parsing [sent. 2776 len. 50]: `` A parish clerk , '' she replied , `` is a man who is employed in the parish or place to which he belongs , to fulfil certain humble duties in connection with the church or place of worship where the people meet together to worship God . ''
Parsing [sent. 2777 len. 8]: `` What does he do there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2778 len. 3]: I inquired .
Parsing [sent. 2779 len. 65]: `` He gives out the psalms that are to be sung , leads the congregation in making their responses to the minister appointed to perform the services of the church ; has the custody of the registry of births , deaths , and burials of the inhabitants , and the care of the church monuments , and of other property belonging to the building .
Parsing [sent. 2780 len. 63]: In some places he also fulfils the duties of bell-ringer and grave-digger ; that is to say , by ringing a large bell at the top of the church , he summons the people to their devotions , during their lives , and digs a hole in consecrated ground , surrounding the sacred building , to receive their bodies when dead . ''
Parsing [sent. 2781 len. 37]: I mused on this strange combination of offices , and entertained a notion of the importance of such a functionary , which I afterwards found was completely at variance with the real state of the case .
Parsing [sent. 2782 len. 30]: `` My father , '' she resumed , `` not only fulfilled all these duties , but contrived to perform the functions of schoolmaster to the parish children . ''
Parsing [sent. 2783 len. 7]: `` What are parish children ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2784 len. 4]: I asked eagerly .
Parsing [sent. 2785 len. 32]: `` I know what children are , as Jackson represented to me that I was the child of my father and mother , but what makes children , parish children ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2786 len. 43]: `` They are the children of the poor , '' Mrs Reichardt replied , `` who , not being able to afford them instruction , willingly allow them to be taught at the expense of the people of the parish generally . ''
Parsing [sent. 2787 len. 7]: I thought this a praiseworthy arrangement .
Parsing [sent. 2788 len. 46]: I knew nothing of poors-rates , and the system of giving relief to the poor of the parish , so long used in England , afterwards explained to me , but the kindness and wisdom of this plan of instruction became evident to my understanding .
Parsing [sent. 2789 len. 88]: I was proceeding to ask other questions , when my mother stopped them by saying , that if I expected her to get through her story , I must let her proceed without further interruption ; for many things would be mentioned by her which demanded explanation , for one so completely unaware of their existence as myself , and that it would be impossible to make me thoroughly acquainted with such things within any reasonable time ; the proper explanations , she promised , should follow .
Parsing [sent. 2790 len. 4]: She then proceeded .
Parsing [sent. 2791 len. 91]: `` My father , it may be thought , had enough on his hands , but in an obscure country town , it is not unusual for one man to unite the occupations of several , and this was particularly the case with my father , who , in addition to the offices I have enumerated , was the best cattle-doctor and bone-setter within ten miles ; and often earned his bread at different kinds of farmer 's work , such as thatching , hedging , ditching and the like .
Parsing [sent. 2792 len. 18]: Nevertheless , he found time to read his Bible , and bring up his only daughter religiously .
Parsing [sent. 2793 len. 6]: This daughter was myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 2794 len. 9]: `` What had become of your mother ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2795 len. 16]: I asked , as I thought it strange Mrs Reichardt should only mention one parent .
Parsing [sent. 2796 len. 75]: `` She had died very soon after my birth , '' she answered , `` and I was left at first to the care of a poor woman , who nursed me ; as soon , however , as I could run about , and had exhibited some signs of intelligence , my father began to get so partial to me , that he very reluctantly allowed me to go out of his sight .
Parsing [sent. 2797 len. 51]: He took great pains in teaching me what he knew , and though the extent of his acquirements was by no means great , it was sufficient to lay a good foundation , and establish a desire for more comprehensive information , which I sought every available means to obtain .
Parsing [sent. 2798 len. 59]: `` I remember that at a very early age I exhibited an extraordinary curiosity for a child ; constantly asking questions , not only of my father , but of all his friends and visitors , and , as they seemed to consider me a quick and lively child , they took pleasure in satisfying my inquisitive spirit .
Parsing [sent. 2799 len. 26]: In this way I gained a great deal of knowledge , and , by observation of what passed around me , a great deal more .
Parsing [sent. 2800 len. 24]: `` It soon became a source of pride and gratification with my father , to ask me to read the Bible to him .
Parsing [sent. 2801 len. 18]: This naturally led to a good many inquiries on my part , and numerous explanations on his .
Parsing [sent. 2802 len. 33]: In course of time , I became familiar with all the sacred writings , and knew their spirit and meaning much better than many persons who were more than double my age .
Parsing [sent. 2803 len. 56]: `` My fondness for such studies , and consequent reputation , attracted the attention of Dr Brightwell , the clergyman of our parish , who had the kindness to let me share the instructions of his children , and still further advanced my education , and still more increased my natural predilection for religious information .
Parsing [sent. 2804 len. 59]: By the time I was thirteen , I became quite a prodigy in Christian learning , and was often sent for to the parsonage , to astonish the great people of the neighbourhood , by the facility with which I answered the most puzzling questions that were put to me , respecting the great mysteries of Christianity . ''
Parsing [sent. 2805 len. 69]: Chapter XXX It was about this time that I first became acquainted with an orphan boy , an inmate of the workhouse , who had been left to the care of the parish by the sudden death of his parents , a German clock-maker and his wife , from a malignant fever which had visited the neighbourhood , and taken off a considerable portion of the labouring population .
Parsing [sent. 2806 len. 51]: I had been sent on errands from my father , to the master of the workhouse , a severe , sullen man , of whom I had a great dread , and I noticed this child , in consequence of his pale and melancholy countenance , and apparently miserable condition .
Parsing [sent. 2807 len. 60]: I observed that no one took any notice of him ; and that he was allowed to wander about the great straggling workhouse , among the insane , the idiotic , and the imbecile , without the slightest attention being paid to his going and coming ; in short , he lived the wretched life of a workhouse boy .
Parsing [sent. 2808 len. 28]: `` I see that you are eager to ask what is a workhouse boy , '' said my mother , `` so I will anticipate your question .
Parsing [sent. 2809 len. 33]: There is , in the various parishes of the country to which we both belong , a building expressly set apart for the accommodation and support of the destitute and disabled poor .
Parsing [sent. 2810 len. 32]: It usually contains inmates of all ages , from the infant just born , to the very aged , whose infirmities shew them to be on the verge of the grave .
Parsing [sent. 2811 len. 23]: They are all known to be in a state of helpless poverty , and quite unable to earn a subsistence for themselves .
Parsing [sent. 2812 len. 49]: In this building they are clothed and fed ; the younger provided with instruction necessary to put them in the way of earning a livelihood ; the elders of the community enjoying the consolations of religion , accorded to them by the regular visits of the chaplain . ''
Parsing [sent. 2813 len. 31]: `` I suppose , '' I here observed , `` that the people who lived there , were deeply impressed with their good fortune in finding such an asylum ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2814 len. 21]: `` As far as I could ever ascertain , '' Mrs Reichardt replied , `` it was exactly the reverse .
Parsing [sent. 2815 len. 26]: It was always thought so degrading to enter a workhouse , that the industrious labourer would endure any and every privation rather than live there .
Parsing [sent. 2816 len. 20]: An honest hard-working man must be sorely driven indeed , to seek such a shelter in his distress . ''
Parsing [sent. 2817 len. 9]: `` That seems strange , '' I observed .
Parsing [sent. 2818 len. 17]: `` Why should he object to receive what he so much stands in need of ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2819 len. 50]: `` When he thus comes upon the funds of the parish , '' answered my mother , `` he becomes what is called a pauper , and among the English peasantry of the better sort , there is the greatest possible aversion to be ranked with this degraded class .
Parsing [sent. 2820 len. 63]: Consequently , the inmates of the workhouses are either those whose infirmities prevent their earning a subsistence , or the idle and the dissolute , who feel none of the honest prejudices of self-dependence , and care only to live from day to day on the coarse and meagre fare afforded them by the charity of their wealthier and more industrious fellow-creatures .
Parsing [sent. 2821 len. 12]: `` The case of this poor boy I thought very pitiable .
Parsing [sent. 2822 len. 10]: I found out that his name was Heinrich Reichardt .
Parsing [sent. 2823 len. 21]: He could speak no language but his own , and therefore his wants remained unknown , and his feelings unregarded .
Parsing [sent. 2824 len. 35]: He had been brought up with a certain sense of comfort and decency , which was cruelly outraged by the position in which he found himself placed by the sudden death of his parents .
Parsing [sent. 2825 len. 29]: I observed that he was often in tears , and his fair features and light hair contrasted remarkably with the squalid faces and matted locks of his companions .
Parsing [sent. 2826 len. 12]: His wretchedness never failed to make a deep impression on me .
Parsing [sent. 2827 len. 17]: `` I brought him little presents , and strove to express my sympathy for his sufferings .
Parsing [sent. 2828 len. 36]: He seemed , at first , more surprised than grateful , but I shortly discovered that my attentions gave him unusual pleasure , and he looked upon my visits as his only solace and gratification .
Parsing [sent. 2829 len. 54]: `` Even at this period I exercised considerable influence over my father , and I managed to interest him in the case of the poor foreign boy to such an extent , that he was induced to take him out of the workhouse , and find him a home under his own roof .
Parsing [sent. 2830 len. 87]: He was at first reluctant to burden himself with the bringing up of a child , who , from his foreign language and habits , could be of little use to him in his avocations ; but I promised to teach him English , and all other learning of which he stood most in need , and assured my father that in a prodigious short time I would make him a much abler assistant than he was likely to find among the boys of the town .
Parsing [sent. 2831 len. 33]: `` My father 's desire to please me , rather than any faith he reposed in my assertions , led him to allow me to do as I pleased in this affair .
Parsing [sent. 2832 len. 42]: I lost no time , therefore , in beginning my course of instruction , and in a few weeks ascertained that I had an apt pupil , who was determined to proceed with his education as fast as circumstances would admit .
Parsing [sent. 2833 len. 32]: We were soon able to express our ideas to each other , and in a few months read together the book out of which I had received so many invaluable lessons .
Parsing [sent. 2834 len. 20]: `` In a short time , I became not less proud of , than partial to , my pupil .
Parsing [sent. 2835 len. 56]: I took him through the same studies which I had pursued under the auspices of our clergyman , and was secretly pleased to find , not only that he was singularly quick in imbibing my instructions , but displayed a strong natural taste for those investigations towards which I had shown so marked a bias .
Parsing [sent. 2836 len. 57]: `` Day after day have we sat together discoursing of the great events recorded in Holy Writ : going over every chapter of its marvellous records , page by page , till the whole was so firmly fixed upon our minds , that we had no necessity during our conversations for referring to the Sacred Book .
Parsing [sent. 2837 len. 72]: We found examples we held up to ourselves for imitation ; we found incidents we regarded as promises of Divine protection ; we found consolation and comfort , as well as exhortation and advice ; and , moreover , we found a sort of instruction that led us to select for ourselves duties that apparently tended to bring us nearer to the Great Being whose goodness we had so diligently studied .
Parsing [sent. 2838 len. 62]: `` My father seemed as much pleased with my successful teaching , as he had been with my successful learning ; and when young Reichardt turned out a remarkably handy and intelligent lad , to whose assistance in some of his avocations he could have recourse with perfect confidence in his cleverness and discretion , he grew extremely partial to him .
Parsing [sent. 2839 len. 35]: Dr Brightwell also proved his friend , and in a few years , the condition of the friendless workhouse boy was so changed , he could not have been taken for the same person .
Parsing [sent. 2840 len. 24]: `` He was a boy of a very grateful spirit , and always regarded me with the devotion of a most thankful heart .
Parsing [sent. 2841 len. 47]: Often would he contrast the wretchedness of his previous condition , with the happiness he now enjoyed , and express in the warmest terms his obligations to me for the important service I had rendered him in rescuing him from the abject misery of the workhouse .
Parsing [sent. 2842 len. 48]: Under these circumstances , it is not extraordinary , that we should learn to regard each other with the liveliest feelings of affection , and while we were still children , endured all the transports and torments which make up the existence of more experienced lovers . ''
Parsing [sent. 2843 len. 30]: `` I do not like interrupting you , '' I here observed , `` but I certainly should like to know what is meant by the word lovers ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2844 len. 55]: `` I can scarcely explain it to you satisfactorily at present , '' said Mrs Reichardt , with a smile ; `` but I have no doubt , before many years have passed over your head -- always provided that you escape from this island -- you will understand it without requiring any explanation .
Parsing [sent. 2845 len. 25]: But I must now leave my story , as many things of much consequence to our future welfare now demand my careful attention . ''
Parsing [sent. 2846 len. 19]: I could not then ascertain from her what was meant by the word whose meaning I had asked .
Parsing [sent. 2847 len. 43]: It had very much excited my curiosity , but she left me to attend to her domestic duties , of which she was extremely regardful , and I had no opportunity at that time of eliciting from her the explanation I desired .
Parsing [sent. 2848 len. 17]: Chapter XXXI It is impossible for me to overrate the value of Mrs Reichardt 's assistance .
Parsing [sent. 2849 len. 25]: Indeed had it not been for her , circumstanced as I was at this particular period , I should in all probability have perished .
Parsing [sent. 2850 len. 17]: Her exhortations saved me from despair , when our position seemed to have grown quite desperate .
Parsing [sent. 2851 len. 10]: But example did more , even , than precept .
Parsing [sent. 2852 len. 31]: Her ingenuity in devising expedients , her activity in putting them in force , her unfailing cheerfulness under disappointment , and Christian resignation under privation , produced the best results .
Parsing [sent. 2853 len. 34]: I was enabled to bear up against the ill effects of our crippled resources , consequent upon the ill conduct of the sailors of the whaler , and the failure of our fish-pond .
Parsing [sent. 2854 len. 72]: She manufactured strong lines for deep sea fishing , and having discovered a shelf of rock , little more than two feet above the sea , to which with a good deal of difficulty I could descend , I took my stand one day on the rock with my lines baited with a piece of one of my feathered favourites , whom dire necessity had at last forced me to destroy .
Parsing [sent. 2855 len. 11]: I waited with all the patience of a veteran angler .
Parsing [sent. 2856 len. 66]: I knew the water to be very deep , and it lay in a sheltered nook or corner of the rocks about ten feet across ; I allowed the line to drop some three or four yards , and not having any float , could only tell I had a bite by feeling a pull at the line , which was wound round my arm .
Parsing [sent. 2857 len. 115]: After some time having been passed in this way , my attention was withdrawn from the line , and given to the narrative I had so lately heard -- that is to say , though my eyes were still fixed upon the line , I had completely given up my thoughts to the story of the poor German boy , who had been snatched from poverty by the interference of the parish clerk 's daughter , and I contrived to speculate on what I should have done under such circumstances , imagining all sorts of extravagances in which I should have indulged , to testify my gratitude to so amiable and benevolent a friend .
Parsing [sent. 2858 len. 27]: A singular course of ideal scenes followed each other in quick succession in my mind -- as I fancied myself the hero of a similar adventure .
Parsing [sent. 2859 len. 48]: I regarded my imaginary benefactress with feelings of such intensity as I had never before experienced ; and it seemed that I was to her the exciting object of sentiments of a like nature , the knowledge of which awoke in our hearts the most agreeable sensations .
Parsing [sent. 2860 len. 20]: I was rudely disturbed out of this day-dream by finding myself suddenly plunged into the deep water beneath me .
Parsing [sent. 2861 len. 69]: The shock was so startling , that some seconds elapsed before I could comprehend my situation ; and then it became clear that I must have hooked a fish , that had not only succeeded in pulling me off my balance , but the line by which he was held being round my arm , cutting painfully into the flesh , threatened drowning by keeping me under water .
Parsing [sent. 2862 len. 59]: With great difficulty I managed to rise to the surface , and loosened the windings of the line from my limb ; then , anxious to retain possession of what from its force must have been a fish well worth some trouble in catching , I held on with both hands , and pulled with all my strength .
Parsing [sent. 2863 len. 27]: At first , by main force I was drawn through the water ; then when I found the strain slacken , I drew in the line .
Parsing [sent. 2864 len. 32]: This manoeuvre was repeated several times , till I succeeded in obtaining a view of what I had caught ; or , more properly speaking , of what had caught me .
Parsing [sent. 2865 len. 56]: It was merely a glimpse ; for the fish , which was a very large one , getting a sight of me within a few yards of him , made some desperate plunges , and again darted off , dragging me along with him , sometimes under the water , and sometimes on the surface .
Parsing [sent. 2866 len. 47]: His body was nearly round , and about seven or eight feet long -- rather a formidable antagonist for close quarters ; nevertheless , I was most eager to get at him , the more so , when I ascertained that his resistance was evidently decreasing .
Parsing [sent. 2867 len. 33]: I continued to approach , and at last got near enough to plunge my knife up to the haft in his head , which at once put an end to the struggle .
Parsing [sent. 2868 len. 7]: But now another difficulty presented itself .
Parsing [sent. 2869 len. 45]: In the ardour of the chase I had been drawn nearly a mile from the island , and I found it impossible to carry back the produce of my sport , exhausted as I was by the efforts I had made in capturing him .
Parsing [sent. 2870 len. 19]: I knew I could not swim with such a burthen for the most inconsiderable portion of the distance .
Parsing [sent. 2871 len. 7]: My fish therefore must be abandoned .
Parsing [sent. 2872 len. 19]: Here was a bountiful supply of food , as soon as placed within reach , rendered totally unavailable .
Parsing [sent. 2873 len. 6]: I thought of Mrs Reichardt .
Parsing [sent. 2874 len. 26]: I thought how gratified she would have been , could I have brought to her such an excellent addition to our scanty stock of food .
Parsing [sent. 2875 len. 32]: Then I thought of her steadfast reliance upon Providence , and what valuable lessons of piety and wisdom she would read me , if she found me depressed by my disappointment .
Parsing [sent. 2876 len. 37]: Chapter XXXII As soon as I could disconnect my tackle from the dead fish , I turned my face homewards , and struck out manfully for the shore ; luckily I did not observe any sharks .
Parsing [sent. 2877 len. 33]: I landed safely without further adventure , and immediately sought my kind friend and companion , whom I found , as usual , industriously employed in endeavouring to secure me additional comforts .
Parsing [sent. 2878 len. 53]: If she was not engaged in ordinary women 's work , making , mending , cleaning , or improving , in our habitation , she was sure to be found doing something in the immediate neighbourhood , which , though less feminine , shewed no less forethought , prudence , and sagacity .
Parsing [sent. 2879 len. 9]: Our garden had prospered wonderfully under her hands .
Parsing [sent. 2880 len. 58]: The ground seemed now stocked with various kinds of vegetation , of which I neither knew the value , nor the proper mode of cultivation ; and we seemed about to be surrounded with shrubs and plants -- many of very pleasing appearance -- that must in a short time entirely change the aspect of the place .
Parsing [sent. 2881 len. 52]: She heard my adventure with a good deal of interest , only remonstrating with me upon my want of caution , and dwelling upon the fatal consequences that must have ensued to herself , had I been drowned or disabled by falling from the rock , or devoured by the sharks .
Parsing [sent. 2882 len. 27]: `` You may consider yourself , my dear son , '' she observed , with serious earnestness , `` to have been under the Divine care .
Parsing [sent. 2883 len. 25]: Nothing can be clearer than that a wise and kind Providence is continually watching over his creatures when placed in unusual or perilous circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 2884 len. 18]: He occasionally affords them manifestations of his favour , to encourage them when engaged in good works .
Parsing [sent. 2885 len. 38]: This shews the comprehensive eye of the master of many workmen , who overlooks the labours of his more industrious servants , and indicates to them his regard for their welfare and appreciation of their labours . ''
Parsing [sent. 2886 len. 66]: `` But surely , '' I interposed , `` if I had been under the superintendence of the Providence of which you speak , I should not have been obliged to abandon so capital a fish , when I had endured such trouble to capture it , and when its possession was so necessary to our comfort , nay , even to our existence . ''
Parsing [sent. 2887 len. 70]: `` The very abandonment of so unwieldy a creature , '' she replied , `` is unanswerable evidence of a Divine interposition in your favour ; for had you persisted in your intention of carrying it to the shore , there is but little doubt that its weight would have overpowered you , and that you would have been drowned ; and then what would have become of me ?
Parsing [sent. 2888 len. 30]: A woman left in this desolate spot to her own resources , must soon be forced to give up the struggle for existence , from want of physical strength .
Parsing [sent. 2889 len. 20]: Nevertheless , there are numerous instances on record , of women having surmounted hardships which few men could endure .
Parsing [sent. 2890 len. 36]: Supported by our Heavenly Father , who is so powerful a protector of the weak , and friend of the helpless , the weakest of our weak sex may triumph over the most intolerable sufferings .
Parsing [sent. 2891 len. 46]: I , however , am not over confident of being so supported , and therefore , I think it would be but shewing a proper consideration for your fellow exile , to act in every emergency with as much circumspection and prudence as possible . ''
Parsing [sent. 2892 len. 23]: I promised that for the future I would run no such risks , and added many professions of regard for her safety .
Parsing [sent. 2893 len. 48]: They had the desired effect ; I pretended to think no more of my disappointment , nevertheless , I found myself constantly dwelling on the size of my lost fish , and lamenting my being obliged to abandon him to his more voracious brethren of the deep .
Parsing [sent. 2894 len. 57]: These thoughts so filled my mind that at night I continued to dream over again the whole incident , beginning with my patient angling from the rock , and concluding with my disconsolate swim to shore -- and pursued my scaly antagonist quite as determinedly in my sleep as I had done in the deep waters .
Parsing [sent. 2895 len. 53]: I rose early after having passed so disturbed a night , and soon made my way to the usual haunt of Nero , whom I discovered in the sea near the rocks making all sorts of strange tumblings and divings , apparently after some dark object that was floating in the water .
Parsing [sent. 2896 len. 38]: I called him away , to examine what it was that had so attracted his attention , and my surprise may be imagined when I made out the huge form of my enemy of the preceding day .
Parsing [sent. 2897 len. 34]: My shouts and exclamations of joy soon brought Mrs Reichardt to the scene , and when she discovered the shape of this prodigious fish , her surprise seemed scarcely less than my own .
Parsing [sent. 2898 len. 59]: How to land him was our first consideration ; and after some debate on the ways and means , I got a rope and leaped into the water with it , fastened a noose round his gills , and then swimming back and climbing the rock ; we jointly tried to pull him up on to the shore .
Parsing [sent. 2899 len. 28]: We hauled and tugged with all our force for a considerable time , but to very little effect ; he was too heavy to pull up perpendicularly .
Parsing [sent. 2900 len. 49]: At last we managed to drag him to a low piece of rock , and there I divided him into several pieces , which Mrs Reichardt carried away to dry and preserve in some way that she said would make the fish capital eating all the year round .
Parsing [sent. 2901 len. 27]: It was very palatable when dressed by her , and as she changed the manner of cooking several times , I never got tired of it .
Parsing [sent. 2902 len. 57]: By its flavour , as far as I could judge from subsequent knowledge , the creature was something of the sturgeon kind of fish , but its proper name I never could learn ; nor was I ever able to catch another , therefore , I must presume that it was a stranger in those seas .
Parsing [sent. 2903 len. 30]: Nevertheless , he proved most acceptable to us both , for we should have fared but ill for some time , had it not been for his providential capture .
Parsing [sent. 2904 len. 65]: It was one afternoon , when we had been enjoying a capital meal at the expense of our great friend , that I led the subject to Mrs Reichardt 's adventures , subsequently to where she broke off in the story of herself and the poor German boy ; and though not without considerable reluctance , I induced her to proceed with her narrative .
Parsing [sent. 2905 len. 32]: Chapter XXXIII `` Our good minister Dr Brightwell , '' she commenced , `` was a man of considerable scholastic attainments , and he delighted in making a display of them .
Parsing [sent. 2906 len. 43]: At one time , he had been master of an extensive grammar school , and now he employed a good deal of his leisure in teaching those boys and girls of the town , who indicated the possession of anything like talent .
Parsing [sent. 2907 len. 38]: The overseers used to talk jestingly to my father of the Doctor teaching plough-boys Greek and Latin ; and wenches , whose chief employment was stone-picking in the fields , geography and the use of the globes .
Parsing [sent. 2908 len. 28]: Even the churchwardens shook their heads , and privately thought the Rector a little out of his seven senses for wasting his learning upon such unprofitable scholars .
Parsing [sent. 2909 len. 20]: Nevertheless , he continued his self-imposed task , without meeting any reward beyond the satisfaction of his own conscience .
Parsing [sent. 2910 len. 28]: It was not till he added to his pupils myself and young Reichardt , that he felt he was doing his duty with some prospect of advantage .
Parsing [sent. 2911 len. 55]: `` The spirit of emulation roused both of us to make extraordinary efforts to second our worthy master 's endeavours : and this did not , as is usually the case , proceed from rivalry -- it arose entirely from a desire of the one to stand well in the estimation of the other .
Parsing [sent. 2912 len. 48]: In this way we learned the French and Latin languages , geography , and the usual branches of a superior education : but our bias was more particularly for religious knowledge , and our preceptor encouraged this , till we were almost as good theologians as himself .
Parsing [sent. 2913 len. 45]: `` While this information was being carefully arranged and digested , there sprung up in our hearts so deep a devotion for each other , that we were miserable when absent and enjoyed no gratification so much as being in each other 's society .
Parsing [sent. 2914 len. 49]: We knew not then the full power and meaning of this preference , but , as we changed from boy and girl-hood to adult life , our feelings developed themselves into that attachment between the sexes , which from time immemorial has received the name of love . ''
Parsing [sent. 2915 len. 34]: `` I think I know what that means , now , '' said I , as my day-dream , which was so rudely disturbed by my fall into the sea occurred to me .
Parsing [sent. 2916 len. 29]: `` It would be strange if you did , '' she replied , `` considering that it is quite impossible you should have become acquainted with it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2917 len. 65]: `` Yes , I am certain I understand it very well , '' I rejoined , more confidently , and then added , not without some embarrassment , `` If I were placed in the position of Heinrich Reichardt , I am quite sure I should feel towards any young female , who was so kind to me , the deepest regard and affection .
Parsing [sent. 2918 len. 24]: I should like to be constantly near her , and should always desire that she should like me better than anyone else . ''
Parsing [sent. 2919 len. 25]: `` That is quite as good an explanation of the matter , as I could expect from you , '' she observed , smiling .
Parsing [sent. 2920 len. 8]: `` But to return to my story .
Parsing [sent. 2921 len. 15]: Our mutual attachment attracted general attention , and was the subject of much observation .
Parsing [sent. 2922 len. 53]: But we had no enemies : and when we were met strolling together in the shady lanes , gathering wild flowers , or wandering through the woods in search of wild strawberries , no one thought it necessary to make any remark if we had our arms round each other 's waist .
Parsing [sent. 2923 len. 14]: My father , if he heard anything about it , did not interfere .
Parsing [sent. 2924 len. 32]: Young Reichardt had made himself so useful to him , and shewed himself so remarkably clever in everything he undertook , that the old man loved him as his own son .
Parsing [sent. 2925 len. 26]: `` It was a settled thing between us , that we were to become man and wife , as soon as we should be permitted .
Parsing [sent. 2926 len. 11]: And many were our plans and schemes for the future .
Parsing [sent. 2927 len. 68]: Heinrich considered himself to be in the position of Jacob , who served such a long and patient apprenticeship for Rachel ; and though he confessed he should not like to wait so long for his wife as the patriarch had been made to do , he acknowledged he would rather serve my father to the full period , than give up all hope of possessing me .
Parsing [sent. 2928 len. 26]: `` This happy state of things was , however , suddenly put an end to , by Dr Brightwell one day sending for my father .
Parsing [sent. 2929 len. 22]: It was a long time before he came back , and when he did , he looked unusually grave and reserved .
Parsing [sent. 2930 len. 19]: In an hour or so he communicated to me the result of his long interview with the Rector .
Parsing [sent. 2931 len. 52]: The Doctor had resolved to send young Reichardt to a distant place , where many learned men lived together in colleges , for the purpose of further advancing his education , and fitting him for a religious teacher , to which vocation he had long expressed a desire to devote himself .
Parsing [sent. 2932 len. 52]: The idea of separation seemed very terrible , but I at last got reconciled to it , in the belief that it would be greatly for Heinrich 's advantage , and we parted at last with many tears , many protestations , some fears , but a great many more hopes .
Parsing [sent. 2933 len. 63]: `` For some days after he had left me , everything seemed so strange , every one seemed so dull , every place seemed so desolate , that I felt as if I had been transported into some dismal scene , where I knew no one , and where there was no one likely to care about me in the slightest degree .
Parsing [sent. 2934 len. 59]: My father went about his avocations in a different spirit to what he had so long been used to exhibit ; it was evident he missed Heinrich as much as I did , and the villagers stared whenever I passed them -- as though my ever going about without Heinrich , was something which they had never anticipated .
Parsing [sent. 2935 len. 33]: `` In course of time , however , to all appearance , everything and every one went on in their daily course , as though no Heinrich had ever been heard of .
Parsing [sent. 2936 len. 49]: My father would sometimes , when overpressed by business , refer to the able assistant he had lost , and now and then I heard a conjecture hazarded by some one or other of his most confidential friends , as to what young Reichardt was doing with himself .
Parsing [sent. 2937 len. 75]: My conjectures , and my references to him , were far from being so occasional ; there was scarce an hour of the day I did not think of him ; but , believing that I should please him most by endeavouring to improve as much as possible during his absence , I did not give myself up to idle reflections respecting the past , or anticipations , equally idle , respecting the future .
Parsing [sent. 2938 len. 10]: `` My great delight was in hearing from him .
Parsing [sent. 2939 len. 61]: At first , his letters expressed only his feelings for me ; then he dwelt more largely on his own exertions for preparing himself for the profession he desired to adopt ; and after a time , his correspondence was almost entirely composed of expositions of his views of a religious life , and dissertations on various points of doctrine .
Parsing [sent. 2940 len. 16]: He evidently was growing more enthusiastic in religion , and less regardful of our attachment .
Parsing [sent. 2941 len. 9]: `` Yet I entertained no apprehensions or misgivings .
Parsing [sent. 2942 len. 53]: I did not think it necessary to consider myself slighted because the thoughts of my future husband were evidently raised more and more above me ; the knowledge of this only made me more anxious to raise myself more and more towards the elevation to which his thoughts were so intently directed .
Parsing [sent. 2943 len. 13]: `` Things went on in this way for two or three years .
Parsing [sent. 2944 len. 15]: I never saw him all this time ; I heard from him but seldom .
Parsing [sent. 2945 len. 18]: He excused his limited correspondence on the plea that his studies left him no time for writing .
Parsing [sent. 2946 len. 54]: I never blamed him for this apparent neglect -- indeed I rather encouraged it , for my exhortations were always that he should address his time and energies towards the attainment of the object I knew him to have so much at heart -- his becoming a minister of our Lord 's Gospel .
Parsing [sent. 2947 len. 15]: `` One day my father came home from the rectory with a troubled countenance .
Parsing [sent. 2948 len. 23]: Dr Brightwell was very indignant because Heinrich had joined a religious community that dissented from the Articles of the Church of England .
Parsing [sent. 2949 len. 58]: The Doctor had offered to get him employment in the Church , if he would give up his new connections : but the more earnest character of his new faith exerted so much influence over his enthusiastic nature , that he willingly abandoned his bright prospects to become a more humble labourer in a less productive vineyard .
Parsing [sent. 2950 len. 53]: `` My father , as the clerk of the parish , seemed to think himself bound to share in the indignation of his pastor for this desertion , and Heinrich was severely condemned by him for displaying such ingratitude to his benefactor : I was commanded to think no more of him .
Parsing [sent. 2951 len. 21]: `` This , however , was not so easy a matter , although our correspondence appeared to have entirely ceased .
Parsing [sent. 2952 len. 25]: I knew not where to address a letter to him and was quite unaware of what his future career was now to be . ''
Parsing [sent. 2953 len. 7]: Chapter XXXIV `` Time passed on .
Parsing [sent. 2954 len. 38]: With all , except myself , Heinrich Reichardt appeared to be forgotten ; in the opinion of all , except myself , he had forgotten our house , and all the friends he had once made there .
Parsing [sent. 2955 len. 41]: Our good Rector had been removed by death from the post he had so ably filled ; and my father being incapacitated by age and infirmity from attending his duties in the church , had his place filled by another .
Parsing [sent. 2956 len. 36]: He had saved sufficient to live upon , and had built himself a small cottage at the end of the village , where we lived together in perfect peace , if not in perfect happiness .
Parsing [sent. 2957 len. 38]: `` I had long grown up to womanhood , and having some abilities , had been employed as one of the teachers of the girls ' school , of which I had raised myself to be mistress .
Parsing [sent. 2958 len. 68]: I conducted myself so as to win the respect of the chief parochial officers , from more than one of whom I received proposals of marriage : but I never could reconcile myself to the idea of becoming the wife of any man but the long-absent Heinrich , and the new clerk and the overseer were fain to be content with my grateful rejection of their proposals .
Parsing [sent. 2959 len. 23]: `` I determined to wait patiently till I could learn from Heinrich 's own lips that he had abandoned his early friend .
Parsing [sent. 2960 len. 47]: I could never get myself to believe in the possibility of his unfaithfulness ; and the remembrances of our mutual studies in the Book of Truth seemed always to suggest the impossibility of his acting so completely at variance with the impressions he had thence received .
Parsing [sent. 2961 len. 68]: `` I was aware that if I had mentioned my hopes of his one day coming to claim me , I should be laughed at by everyone who knew anything of our story -- so I said nothing ; but continued the more devotedly in my heart to cherish that faith which had so long afforded me support against the overwhelming evidence of prolonged silence and neglect .
Parsing [sent. 2962 len. 25]: `` There was a congregation of Dissenters in the town , and I had been once or twice prevailed on to join their devotions .
Parsing [sent. 2963 len. 16]: One day I heard that proceedings of extraordinary interest would take place at the meeting-house .
Parsing [sent. 2964 len. 44]: A minister of great reputation had accepted the situation of Missionary to preach the Gospel to the heathen , and he was visiting the different congregations that lay in his route to the seaport whence he was to embark to the Sandwich Islands .
Parsing [sent. 2965 len. 24]: He was expected to address a discourse to the Dissenters of our parish , and I was induced to go and hear him .
Parsing [sent. 2966 len. 64]: `` The meeting-house was very much crowded , but I contrived to get a seat within a short distance of the speakers , and waited with much interest to behold the man , who , like some of the first preachers , had chosen the perilous task of endeavouring to convert a nation of savage idolaters to the faith of the true Christ .
Parsing [sent. 2967 len. 22]: `` After a short delay he appeared on a raised platform , and was introduced to this congregation by their minister .
Parsing [sent. 2968 len. 33]: I heard nothing of this introduction , though it seemed a long one ; I saw nothing of the speaker , though his was a figure which always attracted an attentive audience .
Parsing [sent. 2969 len. 6]: I saw only the stranger .
Parsing [sent. 2970 len. 20]: In those pale , grave , and serious features then presented to me , I recognised Heinrich Reichardt . ''
Parsing [sent. 2971 len. 20]: `` He had come back to you at last , '' I exclaimed ; `` I thought he would .
Parsing [sent. 2972 len. 26]: After all you had done for the poor German boy , it was impossible that he should grow up to manhood and forget you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2973 len. 9]: `` You shall hear , '' she replied .
Parsing [sent. 2974 len. 62]: `` For some time my heart beat wildly , and I thought I should be obliged to leave the place , my sensations became so overpowering ; but the fear of disturbing the congregation , and of attracting attention towards myself , had such influence over me , that I managed to retain sufficient control over my feelings to remain quiet .
Parsing [sent. 2975 len. 25]: Nevertheless , my eyes were upon Heinrich , and my whole heart and soul were exclusively engrossed by him while he continued before me .
Parsing [sent. 2976 len. 7]: `` Presently he began to speak .
Parsing [sent. 2977 len. 15]: As I have just said , I paid no attention to the preliminary proceedings .
Parsing [sent. 2978 len. 38]: I know nothing of the manner in which he was introduced to his audience ; but when he became the speaker , every word fell upon my ear with a distinctness that seemed quite marvellous to me .
Parsing [sent. 2979 len. 8]: `` And how could it be otherwise ?
Parsing [sent. 2980 len. 64]: His tall figure , his melancholy yet expressive features , his earnest manner , and clear and sonorous voice , invested him with all the power and dignity of an Apostle , and when with these attributes were joined those associations of the past with which he was so intimately connected , it is impossible to exaggerate the influence he exercised over me .
Parsing [sent. 2981 len. 42]: `` He began with a fervent blessing on all who had sought the sanctity of that roof , and his hearers , impressed with the thrilling earnestness of his delivery , became at once hushed into a kind of awe-struck attention .
Parsing [sent. 2982 len. 11]: They knelt down , and bowed their heads in prayer .
Parsing [sent. 2983 len. 39]: `` I appeared to have no power to follow the general example , but remained the only sitter in the entire congregation with my eyes , nay , all my senses , fixed , rivetted upon the preacher .
Parsing [sent. 2984 len. 9]: This , of course , attracted his attention .
Parsing [sent. 2985 len. 43]: I saw him look towards me with surprise , then he started , his voice hesitated for a moment , but he almost immediately continued his benediction , and , as it seemed to me , with a voice tremulous with emotion .
Parsing [sent. 2986 len. 16]: `` Then followed a discourse on the object of the preacher in presenting himself there .
Parsing [sent. 2987 len. 55]: He described the wonderful goodness of the Creator in continually raising up the most humble instruments of his will to perform the most important offices ; in illustration of which he referred to the numerous instances in the Old and New Testaments , where God 's preference in this way is so clearly manifested .
Parsing [sent. 2988 len. 30]: `` He then stated that ' a case had arisen for Divine interposition , equal in necessity to any which had occurred since the first commencement of Christianity . '
Parsing [sent. 2989 len. 24]: He explained that ` there were nations still existing in a distant portion of the globe in a state of the wildest barbarism .
Parsing [sent. 2990 len. 29]: Ignorant savages were they , with many cruel and idolatrous customs , who were cannibals and murderers , and given up to the worst vices of the heathen .
Parsing [sent. 2991 len. 45]: Their abject and pitiable state , he told us , the Lord God had witnessed with Divine commiseration , and had determined that the light of Christian love should shine upon their darkness , and that Almighty wisdom should dissipate their besotted ignorance . ''
Parsing [sent. 2992 len. 23]: ` But who ' he asked , ` was to be the ambassador from so stupendous a Power to these barbarous states ?
Parsing [sent. 2993 len. 18]: Who would venture to be a messenger of peace and comfort to a cruel and savage nation ?
Parsing [sent. 2994 len. 32]: Was there no man , ' he again asked , ` great enough and bold enough to undertake a mission of such vast importance , attended by such terrible risks ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2995 len. 43]: ` The Almighty Ruler seeks not for his ministers among the great and bold , ' he added , ` as it is written , He hath put down the mighty from their seats , and hath exalted the humble and meek .
Parsing [sent. 2996 len. 41]: And it will be peculiarly so on this occasion , for the exaltation is from the humblest origin ; so humble it is scarcely possible to imagine so miserable a beginning , in the end attaining distinction so honorable . ''
Parsing [sent. 2997 len. 53]: ` Imagine , if you can , my brethren , ' he said , ` in the building set apart in your town for the reception of your destitute poor , a child parentless , friendless , and moneyless , condemned , as it seemed , to perpetual raggedness and intolerable suffering .
Parsing [sent. 2998 len. 54]: A ministering angel , under the direction of the Supreme Goodness , took that child by the hand and led it out of the pauper walls that enclosed it , and under its auspices the child grew and flourished , and learned all that was excellent in faith and admirable in practice . ''
Parsing [sent. 2999 len. 14]: ` It was ordained that he should lose sight of his angelic teacher .
Parsing [sent. 3000 len. 14]: A dire necessity compelled him to withdraw from that pure and gracious influence .
Parsing [sent. 3001 len. 16]: He had to learn in a different school , and prepare himself for heavier tasks .
Parsing [sent. 3002 len. 12]: Manhood , with all its severe responsibilities , came upon him .
Parsing [sent. 3003 len. 31]: He sought first to render himself competent for some holy undertaking , before he could consider himself worthy again to claim that notice which had made him what he was .
Parsing [sent. 3004 len. 37]: Earnestly he strove for the Divine assistance and encouragement ; and as his qualifications increased , his estimate of the worthiness necessary for the object he had in view , became more and more exalted . ''
Parsing [sent. 3005 len. 37]: ` At last , ' he continued , ` it became known to him that a Missionary was required to explain to the savage people to whom I have already alluded , the principles of Christianity .
Parsing [sent. 3006 len. 70]: He was appointed to this sacred trust : and he then determined , before he left this country for the distant one of his ministry , to present himself before that beneficent being who had poured out before him so abundant a measure of Christian virtue ; that they might be joined together in the same great vocation , and support each other in the same important trust . '
Parsing [sent. 3007 len. 10]: `` I heard enough , '' continued Mrs Reichardt .
Parsing [sent. 3008 len. 11]: `` All was explained , and I was fully satisfied .
Parsing [sent. 3009 len. 20]: The discourse proceeded to identify the speaker with the poor boy who had been preserved for such onerous duties .
Parsing [sent. 3010 len. 32]: Then came an appeal to the congregation for their prayers , and such assistance as they could afford , to advance so holy a work as the conversion of the heathen .
Parsing [sent. 3011 len. 22]: `` I was in such a tumult of pleasant feelings that I retained but a confused recollection of the subsequent events .
Parsing [sent. 3012 len. 42]: I only remember that as I was walking home from the meeting , I heard footsteps quickly following ; in a few minutes more the voice that had so lately filled my heart to overflowing with happiness , again addressed me .
Parsing [sent. 3013 len. 25]: I was too much excited to remain unconcerned on suddenly discovering that Heinrich was so near , and I fell fainting into his arms .
Parsing [sent. 3014 len. 20]: `` I was carried into a neighbouring cottage , but in a short time was enabled to proceed home .
Parsing [sent. 3015 len. 66]: In a week afterwards we were married : a few days more sufficed for the preparations that were required for my destination , and then we proceeded to the port , and embarked on board the ship that was to take us over many thousand miles of sea , to the wild , unknown country that was to be the scene of our mission . ''
Parsing [sent. 3016 len. 23]: Chapter XXXV Mrs Reichardt was obliged to break off her narrative , where it concluded at the end of the last chapter .
Parsing [sent. 3017 len. 30]: As I have said , her household duties , being very numerous , and requiring a great deal of attention , took up nearly the whole of her time .
Parsing [sent. 3018 len. 26]: The garden now presented a most agreeable appearance , possessing several different kinds of vegetables , and various plants that had been raised from seed .
Parsing [sent. 3019 len. 32]: We had succeeded in raising several young orange trees from the pips she had brought in her basket ; and they promised to supply us with plenty of their luscious fruit .
Parsing [sent. 3020 len. 23]: Even the peas we thought so dry and useless had germinated , and provided us with a welcome addition to our table .
Parsing [sent. 3021 len. 28]: I shall never forget the first day she added to our scanty meal of dried fish a dish of smoking potatoes fresh out of the moist earth .
Parsing [sent. 3022 len. 39]: After enjoying sufficiently my wonder at their appearance , and delight at their agreeable taste , she informed me of their first introduction into Europe , and their gradual diffusion over the more civilised portions of the globe .
Parsing [sent. 3023 len. 34]: I speak of Europe now , because I had learned from my companion , not only a good deal of geography , but had obtained some insight into several other branches of knowledge .
Parsing [sent. 3024 len. 55]: In particular , she had told me much interesting information about England , much more than I had learned from Jackson ; dwelling upon its leading features , and the most remarkable portions of its history ; and I must acknowledge that I felt a secret pride in belonging to so great a country .
Parsing [sent. 3025 len. 86]: I considered that I belonged to it , for my father and mother were English , and though I might be called The Little Savage , and be fixed to an obscure island in the great ocean , I felt that my real home was in this great country my mother talked about so glowingly , and that my chief object ought to be to return into the hands of my grandfather the belt that had in so singular a manner come into my possession .
Parsing [sent. 3026 len. 39]: I often thought of this great England whose glory had been so widely spread and so durably established , and longed for some means of leaving our present abode , and going in search of its time-honoured shores .
Parsing [sent. 3027 len. 13]: But I asked myself how was this desirable object to be effected ?
Parsing [sent. 3028 len. 18]: We had no means of transporting ourselves from the prison into which we had been accidentally cast .
Parsing [sent. 3029 len. 40]: We had nothing resembling a boat on the island , and we had no tools for making one ; and even had we been put in possession of such a treasure , we had no means of launching it .
Parsing [sent. 3030 len. 18]: The rocky character of the coast made the placing of a boat on the water almost impossible .
Parsing [sent. 3031 len. 14]: The expectation of a vessel appearing off the island appeared quite as unreasonable .
Parsing [sent. 3032 len. 27]: We had seen no ships for a long time , and those we had observed were a great deal too far off to heed our signals .
Parsing [sent. 3033 len. 19]: We had no help for it , but to trust to Providence and bear our present evil patiently .
Parsing [sent. 3034 len. 62]: Nevertheless , I took my glass and swept the sea far and wide in search of a ship , but failed to discover anything but a spermaceti whale blowing in the distance , or a shoal of porpoises tumbling over each other nearer the shore , or a colony of seals basking in the sun on the rocks nearest the sea .
Parsing [sent. 3035 len. 41]: My disappointment was shared by Nero , who seemed to regard my vexation with a sympathising glance , and even the gannets turned their dull stupid gaze upon me , with an expression as if they deeply commiserated my distress .
Parsing [sent. 3036 len. 53]: I had for a long time employed myself in making a shelving descent to the sea , on the most secure part of the rock , intending that it should be a landing place for a boat , in case any ship should come near enough to send one to our rescue .
Parsing [sent. 3037 len. 87]: It was a work of great labour , and hatchet and spade equally suffered in my endeavours to effect my object ; but at last I contrived to take advantage of a natural fracture in the rock , and a subsequent fall of the cliff , to make a rude kind of inclined plane , rather too steep , and too rough for bad climbers , but extremely convenient for my mother and me , whenever we should be prepared to embark for our distant home .
Parsing [sent. 3038 len. 36]: My thoughts were now often directed to the possibility of making on the island some kind of boat that would hold ourselves and sufficient provisions for a voyage to the nearest of the larger islands .
Parsing [sent. 3039 len. 91]: I spoke to Mrs Reichardt on the subject , but she dwelt upon the impossibility without either proper tools , or the slightest knowledge of boat-building , of producing a vessel to which we could trust ourselves with any confidence , neither of us knowing anything about its management in the open sea ; and then she spoke of the dangers a small boat would meet with , if the water should be rough , or if we should not be able to make the island in any reasonable time .
Parsing [sent. 3040 len. 14]: Yet I was not daunted by difficulties , nor dissuaded by discouraging representations .
Parsing [sent. 3041 len. 63]: I thought at first of fastening all the loose timber together that had drifted against the rocks , as much in the shape of a boat as I could get it , but on looking over my stock of nails , I found they fell very far short of the proper quantity ; consequently that mode of effecting my purpose was abandoned .
Parsing [sent. 3042 len. 16]: I then thought of felling a tree and hollowing it out by charring the timber .
Parsing [sent. 3043 len. 12]: As yet I had discovered nothing on the island but shrubs .
Parsing [sent. 3044 len. 42]: I was quite certain that no tree grew near enough to the sea to be available , and if I should succeed in cutting down a large one and fashioning it as I desired , I had no means of transport .
Parsing [sent. 3045 len. 66]: I might possibly make a boat capable of carrying all I wanted to put into it , but as I could neither move the water up to the boat , nor the boat down to the water , for all the service I wanted of it , even if the island contained a tree large enough , I might just as well leave it untouched .
Parsing [sent. 3046 len. 10]: Still I would not altogether abandon my favourite project .
Parsing [sent. 3047 len. 31]: I thought of the willows that grew on the island , and fancied I could make a framework by twisting them strongly together , and stretching seal skins over them .
Parsing [sent. 3048 len. 32]: I laboured at this for several weeks , -- exercising all my ingenuity and no slight stock of patience , to create an object with which I was but imperfectly acquainted .
Parsing [sent. 3049 len. 64]: I did succeed at last in putting together something in a remote degree resembling the boat that brought part of the whaler 's crew to the island and had taken them away , but it was not a quarter the size , and was so light that I could carry it without much difficulty to the landing I had constructed on the cliff .
Parsing [sent. 3050 len. 46]: When I came to try its capabilities , I found it terribly lop-sided -- it soon began to leak , and in fact it exhibited so many faults , that I was forced to drag it again on shore , and take it to pieces .
Parsing [sent. 3051 len. 45]: I called in Mrs Reichardt to my assistance , and though at first she seemed averse to the experiment , she gave me a great deal of information respecting the structure of small boats , and the method of waterproofing leather and other fabrics .
Parsing [sent. 3052 len. 17]: I attended carefully to all she said , and commenced re-building with more pretensions to art .
Parsing [sent. 3053 len. 25]: I now made a strong frame-work , tolerably sharp at each end , and as nearly as possible resembling a keel at the bottom .
Parsing [sent. 3054 len. 38]: I covered this on both sides with pieces of strong cloth saturated with grease from the carcases of birds , and then covered the whole with well-dried seal skins , which I had made impervious to wet .
Parsing [sent. 3055 len. 34]: The inside of the boat nearest the water I neatly covered with pieces of dry bark , over which I fixed some boards , which had floated to the island from wrecked ships .
Parsing [sent. 3056 len. 21]: Finally I put in some benches to sit on , and then fancied I had done everything that was necessary .
Parsing [sent. 3057 len. 28]: I soon got her into the fishing-pool , and was delighted to find that she floated capitally -- but I still had a great deal to do .
Parsing [sent. 3058 len. 26]: I had made neither oars to propel her through the water , nor sail to carry her through the waves , when rowing was impossible .
Parsing [sent. 3059 len. 55]: I remembered the whaler 's spare oars and mizen , but they were too large ; nevertheless , they served me as models to work upon , and in time I made a rough pair of paddles or oars , which , though rudely fashioned , I hoped would answer the purpose pretty well .
Parsing [sent. 3060 len. 25]: The next difficulty was how to use the oars , and I made many awkward attempts before I ascertained the proper method of proceeding .
Parsing [sent. 3061 len. 28]: Again my companion , on whom nothing which had once passed before her eyes had passed in vain , shewed me how the boat should be managed .
Parsing [sent. 3062 len. 107]: In a short time I could row about the pool with sufficient dexterity to turn the boat in any direction I required , and I then took Nero as a passenger , and he seemed to enjoy the new gratification with a praiseworthy decorum ; till , when I was trying to turn the boat round , the movement caused him to attempt to shift his quarters , which he did with so little attention to the build of our vessel , that in one moment she was capsized , and in the next we were swimming about in the pool with our vessel bottom upwards .
Parsing [sent. 3063 len. 27]: As she was so light , I soon righted her , and found that she had received no injury , and appeared to be perfectly water-tight .
Parsing [sent. 3064 len. 41]: Chapter XXXVI I could not prevail upon Mrs Reichardt to embark in my craft , the fate of my first passenger which she had witnessed from the shore , had deterred her from attempting a voyage under such unpromising circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 3065 len. 25]: As soon as I had dried my clothes , I was for making another experiment , and one too of a more hazardous nature .
Parsing [sent. 3066 len. 29]: I would not be parted from Nero , but I made him lie at the bottom of the boat , where I could have him under strict control .
Parsing [sent. 3067 len. 45]: With him I also took my little flock of gannets , who perched themselves round me , gazing about them with an air of such singular stupidity as they were being propelled through the water , that I could not help bursting out laughing .
Parsing [sent. 3068 len. 27]: `` Indeed , '' said Mrs Reichardt , `` such a boat 's crew and such a boat has never been seen in those seas before .
Parsing [sent. 3069 len. 38]: A young savage as captain , a tame seal as boatswain , and a flock of gannets as sailors , certainly made up as curious a set of adventurers as ever floated upon the wide ocean . ''
Parsing [sent. 3070 len. 47]: I was not the least remarkable of the strange group , for I had nothing on but a pair of duck trousers , patched in several places ; and my hair , which had grown very long , hung in black wavy masses to my shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 3071 len. 30]: My skin was tanned by the sun to a light brown , very different from the complexion of Mrs Reichardt , which had ever been remarkable for its paleness .
Parsing [sent. 3072 len. 36]: Indeed she told me I should find some difficulty in establishing my claim to the title of European , but none at all to that of Little Savage , which she often playfully called me .
Parsing [sent. 3073 len. 30]: Nevertheless , in this trim , and with these companions , I passed out of the fishing-pool into the sea , with the intention of rowing round the island .
Parsing [sent. 3074 len. 43]: Mrs Reichardt waved her hand as I departed on my voyage , having exhorted me to be very careful , as long as I was in hearing ; she then turned away , as I thought , to return to the hut .
Parsing [sent. 3075 len. 6]: The day was remarkably fine .
Parsing [sent. 3076 len. 64]: There was not so much as a cloud on the horizon , and scarcely a ripple on the water : therefore , everything seemed to favour my project , for if there had been anything of a breeze , the beating of the waves against the rock would have been a great obstacle to my pursuing my voyage with either comfort or safety .
Parsing [sent. 3077 len. 51]: The water too was so clear , that although it was of great depth , I could distinguish the shells that lay on the sand , and observe various kinds of fish , some of most curious shape , that rushed rapidly beneath the boat as it was urged along .
Parsing [sent. 3078 len. 21]: I was delighted with the motion , and with the agreeable appearance of the different novelties that met my gaze .
Parsing [sent. 3079 len. 16]: The light boat glided almost imperceptibly through the water at every stroke of the oar .
Parsing [sent. 3080 len. 39]: Nero lay as still as if his former lesson had taught him the necessity of remaining motionless ; and the gannets now and then expressed their satisfaction by a shrill cry or a rapid fluttering of their wings .
Parsing [sent. 3081 len. 40]: In this way , we passed on without any adventure , till I found it necessary for me to row some distance out to sea , to round a projecting rock that stood like a mighty wall before me .
Parsing [sent. 3082 len. 20]: I pulled accordingly , and then had a better opportunity of seeing the island than I had ever obtained .
Parsing [sent. 3083 len. 74]: I recognised all the favourite places , the ravine , the wood , the hut covered with beautiful creepers , and the garden , full of flowers , looked very agreeable to the eye : but every part seemed to look pleasant , except the great savage rocks which enclosed the island on every side : but even these I thought had an air of grandeur that gave additional effect to the scene .
Parsing [sent. 3084 len. 27]: Much to my surprise , I recognised Mrs Reichardt walking rapidly towards a part of the shore , near which I should be obliged to pass .
Parsing [sent. 3085 len. 41]: From this I saw that she was intent on watching me from point to point , to know the worst , if any accident should befall me , and be at hand should there be a necessity for rendering assistance .
Parsing [sent. 3086 len. 13]: I shouted to her , and she waved her hand in reply .
Parsing [sent. 3087 len. 24]: On rounding the headland , my astonishment was extreme on finding my little bark in the midst of a shoal of enormous sharks .
Parsing [sent. 3088 len. 56]: If I came in contact with one of them I was lost , for the frail boat would certainly be upset and as Jackson had assured me , if ever I allowed these monsters to come near enough , one snap of their jaws , and there would be an end of the Little Savage .
Parsing [sent. 3089 len. 52]: I thought of the warning of Mrs Reichardt , and was inclined to think I had better have taken her advice , and remained in the fishing-pool ; nevertheless , I went on as quietly and deliberately as possible , exercising all my skill to keep clear of my unexpected enemies .
Parsing [sent. 3090 len. 84]: It was not till I had got into the middle of the shoal that the sharks seemed to be aware there was anything unusual in their neighbourhood , but as soon as they were fully aware of the presence of an intruder , they exhibited the most extraordinary excitement , rushing together in groups , with such rapid motion , that the water became so agitated , I was obliged to exercise all my skill to keep the boat steady on her course .
Parsing [sent. 3091 len. 45]: They dived , and rushed to and fro , and jostled each other , as I thought , in anything but an amicable spirit ; still , however , keeping at a respectful distance from the boat , for which I was extremely thankful .
Parsing [sent. 3092 len. 31]: I urged her on with all my strength , for the purpose of getting away from such unpleasant neighbours ; but they were not to be so easily disposed of .
Parsing [sent. 3093 len. 32]: They came swimming after the boat , then when within a few yards dived , and in a moment they were before it , as if to bar any further progress .
Parsing [sent. 3094 len. 19]: I however pushed on , and they disappeared , but immediately afterwards rose on all sides of me .
Parsing [sent. 3095 len. 62]: They were evidently getting more confidence ; a fact I ascertained with no slight apprehension , for they began to approach nearer , and their gambols threatened every minute to overwhelm my poor craft , that , light as a cork , bounced up and down the agitated waves , as if quite as much alarmed for our safety as ourselves .
Parsing [sent. 3096 len. 90]: The captain was not the only one who began to fear evil ; the gannets were very restless , and it was only by strong admonitions I could prevail on Nero to retain his recumbent attitude at my feet ; their instinct warned them of approaching danger , and I felt the comfortable assurance that my own rashness had brought me into my present critical position , and that if the menaced destruction did arrive , there was no sort of assistance at hand on which I could rely .
Parsing [sent. 3097 len. 36]: Every moment the sharks became more violent in their demonstrations , and more bold in their approaches , and I could scarcely keep the boat going , or prevent the water rushing over her sides .
Parsing [sent. 3098 len. 47]: The gannets , having shewn themselves for some minutes uneasy , had at last flown away to the neighbouring rock , and Nero began to growl and snap , as though meditating a forcible release from his prostrate position , to see what mischief was brewing .
Parsing [sent. 3099 len. 45]: As I was coaxing him to be quiet , I felt a tremendous blow given to the boat , evidently from beneath , and she rose into the air several yards , scattering Nero and myself , and the oars , in different directions .
Parsing [sent. 3100 len. 35]: The noise we made in falling appeared for the instant to have scattered the creatures , for I had struck out for the rock and nearly reached it before a shark made its appearance .
Parsing [sent. 3101 len. 11]: Just then I saw a large monster rushing towards me .
Parsing [sent. 3102 len. 6]: I thought all was over .
Parsing [sent. 3103 len. 18]: He turned to open his great jaws , and in another instant I should have been devoured .
Parsing [sent. 3104 len. 23]: At that critical period I saw a second object dart in between me and the shark , and attack the latter fiercely .
Parsing [sent. 3105 len. 17]: It was Nero , and it was the last I ever saw of my faithful friend .
Parsing [sent. 3106 len. 46]: His timely interposition enabled me to reach a ledge in the cliff , where I was in perfect safety , hanging by some strong seaweed , although my feet nearly touched the water , and I could retain my position only with the greatest difficulty .
Parsing [sent. 3107 len. 8]: The whole shoal were presently around me .
Parsing [sent. 3108 len. 40]: They a first paid their attentions to the boat and the oars , which they buffeted about till they were driven close to the rock , at a little distance from the place where I had found temporary safety .
Parsing [sent. 3109 len. 25]: They left these things unharmed as soon as they caught sight of me , and then their eagerness and violence returned with tenfold fury .
Parsing [sent. 3110 len. 52]: They darted towards me in a body , and I was obliged to lift my legs , or I should have had them snapped off by one or other of the twenty gaping jaws that were thrust over each other , in their eagerness to make a mouthful of my limbs .
Parsing [sent. 3111 len. 14]: This game was carried on for some minutes of horrible anxiety to me .
Parsing [sent. 3112 len. 38]: I fancied that my struggles had loosened the seaweed , and that in a few minutes it must give way , and I should then be fought for and torn to pieces by the ravenous crew beneath .
Parsing [sent. 3113 len. 84]: I shouted with all the strength of my lungs to scare them away ; but as if they were as well aware that I could not escape them as I was myself , they merely left off their violent efforts to reach my projecting legs , and forming a semi-circle round me , watched with upturned eyes , that seemed to possess a fiendish expression that fascinated and bewildered me , the snapping of the frail hold that supported me upon the rock .
Parsing [sent. 3114 len. 34]: In my despair I prayed heartily , but it was rather to commend my soul to my Maker , than with any prospect of being rescued from so imminent and horrible a peril .
Parsing [sent. 3115 len. 13]: The eyes of the ravenous monsters below seemed to mock my devotion .
Parsing [sent. 3116 len. 32]: I felt the roots of the seaweed giving way : the slightest struggle on my part would I knew only hasten my dissolution , and I resigned myself to my fate .
Parsing [sent. 3117 len. 13]: In this awful moment I heard a voice calling out my name .
Parsing [sent. 3118 len. 11]: It was Mrs Reichardt on the cliff high above me .
Parsing [sent. 3119 len. 9]: I answered with all the eagerness of despair .
Parsing [sent. 3120 len. 49]: Then there came a heavy splash into the water , and I heard her implore me to endeavour to make for a small shrub that grew in a hollow of the rock , at a very short distance from the tuft of seaweed that had become so serviceable .
Parsing [sent. 3121 len. 4]: I looked down .
Parsing [sent. 3122 len. 38]: The sharks had all disappeared ; I knew , however , that they would shortly return , and lost not a moment in making an effort to better my position in the manner I had been directed .
Parsing [sent. 3123 len. 24]: Mrs Reichardt had thrown a heavy stone into the water among the sharks , the loud splash of which had driven them away .
Parsing [sent. 3124 len. 28]: Before they again made their appearance , I had caught a firm hold of the twig , and flung myself up into a position of perfect safety .
Parsing [sent. 3125 len. 8]: `` Thank God he 's safe ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3126 len. 6]: I heard Mrs Reichardt exclaim .
Parsing [sent. 3127 len. 22]: The sharks did return , but when they found their anticipated prey had escaped , they swam lazily out to sea .
Parsing [sent. 3128 len. 10]: `` Are you much hurt , Frank Henniker ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3129 len. 7]: she presently cried out to me .
Parsing [sent. 3130 len. 11]: `` I have not a scratch , '' I replied .
Parsing [sent. 3131 len. 12]: `` Then thank God for your deliverance , '' she added .
Parsing [sent. 3132 len. 30]: I did thank God , and Mrs Reichardt joined with me in prayer , and a more fervent thanksgiving than was ours , it is scarcely possible to imagine .
Parsing [sent. 3133 len. 27]: Chapter XXXVII I had several times pressed Mrs Reichardt for the conclusion of her story , but she had always seemed reluctant to resume the subject .
Parsing [sent. 3134 len. 16]: It was evidently full of painful incidents , and she shrunk from dwelling upon them .
Parsing [sent. 3135 len. 44]: At last , one evening we were sitting together , she working with her needle and I employed upon a net she had taught me how to manufacture , and I again led the conversation to the narrative my companion had left unfinished .
Parsing [sent. 3136 len. 7]: She sighed heavily and looked distressed .
Parsing [sent. 3137 len. 39]: `` It is but natural you should expect this of me , my son , '' she said ; `` but you little know the suffering caused by my recalling the melancholy events that I have to detail .
Parsing [sent. 3138 len. 25]: However , I have led you to expect the entire relation , and , therefore , I will endeavour to realise your anticipations . ''
Parsing [sent. 3139 len. 25]: I assured her I was ready to wait , whenever it might be agreeable for her to narrate the termination of her interesting history .
Parsing [sent. 3140 len. 30]: `` It will never be agreeable to me , '' she replied mournfully ; `` indeed I would forget it , if I could ; but that is impossible .
Parsing [sent. 3141 len. 14]: The struggle may as well be made now , as at any time .
Parsing [sent. 3142 len. 30]: I will therefore commence by informing you , that during our long voyage to the Sandwich Islands , I found ample opportunity for studying the disposition of my husband .
Parsing [sent. 3143 len. 35]: He was much changed since he first left me , but his was still the same grateful nature , full of truth and purity , that had won me towards him when a child .
Parsing [sent. 3144 len. 12]: A holy enthusiasm seemed now to exalt him above ordinary humanity .
Parsing [sent. 3145 len. 39]: I could scarcely ever get him to talk upon any but religious subjects , and those he treated in so earnest and exalted a manner , that it was impossible to avoid being carried away with his eloquence .
Parsing [sent. 3146 len. 38]: `` He seemed to feel the greatness of his destination , as though it had raised him to an equality with the adventurous Saints , who established the banner of Christ among the Pagan nations of Europe .
Parsing [sent. 3147 len. 38]: He was fond of dilating upon the importance of his mission , and of dwelling on the favour that had been vouchsafed him , in causing him to be selected for so high and responsible a duty .
Parsing [sent. 3148 len. 36]: `` It was evident that he would rather have been sent to associate with the barbarous people whom he expected to make his converts , than have been raised to the richest Bishopric in England .
Parsing [sent. 3149 len. 33]: And yet , with this exultation , there was a spirit of deep melancholy pervading his countenance , as well as his discourses , that seemed to imply a sense of danger .
Parsing [sent. 3150 len. 16]: The nimbus of the saint in his eyes was associated with the crown of martyrdom .
Parsing [sent. 3151 len. 23]: He seemed to look forward to a fatal termination of his ministry , as the most and proper conclusion of his labours .
Parsing [sent. 3152 len. 9]: `` His conversation often filled me with dread .
Parsing [sent. 3153 len. 36]: His intimations of danger seemed at first very shocking , but , at last , I got more familiar with these terrible suggestions , and regarded them as the distempered fancies of an overworked mind .
Parsing [sent. 3154 len. 20]: `` In this way our long voyage passed , and we arrived at last at our place of destination .
Parsing [sent. 3155 len. 29]: When we had disembarked , the scene that presented itself to me was so strange , that I could almost believe I had passed into a new world .
Parsing [sent. 3156 len. 38]: The most luxurious vegetation , of a character I had never seen before -- the curious buildings -- the singular forms of the natives , and their peculiar costume -- excited my wonder to an intense degree .
Parsing [sent. 3157 len. 24]: `` My husband applied himself diligently to learn the language of the people , whilst I as intently studied their habits and customs .
Parsing [sent. 3158 len. 6]: We both made rapid progress .
Parsing [sent. 3159 len. 58]: `` As soon as I could make myself understood , I endeavoured to make friends with the women , particularly with the wives of the great men , and although I was at first the object of more curiosity than regard , I persisted in my endeavours , and succeeded in establishing with many a good understanding .
Parsing [sent. 3160 len. 42]: `` I found them ignorant of everything that in civilised countries is considered knowledge -- their minds being enveloped in the most deplorable darkness -- the only semblance of religion in use amongst them , being a brutal and absurd idolatry .
Parsing [sent. 3161 len. 69]: `` I often tried to lead them to the consideration of more humanising truths , for the purpose of preparing the way for the inculcation of the great mysteries of our holy religion : but the greater portion of my hearers were incompetent to understand what I seemed so desirous of teaching , and my making them comprehend the principles of Christianity appeared to be a hopeless task .
Parsing [sent. 3162 len. 56]: `` Yet I continued my pious labours , without allowing my exertions to flag -- making myself useful to them and their families in every way I could -- attending them when sick -- giving them presents when well -- and showing them every kindness likely to make a favourable impression on their savage natures .
Parsing [sent. 3163 len. 43]: In this way I proceeded doing good , till I found an opportunity of being of service to a young girl , about twelve years of age , who was a younger sister of one of the wives of a great chief .
Parsing [sent. 3164 len. 23]: She had sprained her ankle and was in great pain , when I applied the proper remedies and gave her speedy relief .
Parsing [sent. 3165 len. 41]: Hooloo , for that was her name , from that moment became warmly attached to me , and finding her of an affectionate and ingenuous disposition , I became extremely desirous of improving upon the good impression I had made .
Parsing [sent. 3166 len. 30]: `` At the same time my husband sought , by his knowledge of the mechanical arts , and some acquaintance with medicine , to recommend himself to the men .
Parsing [sent. 3167 len. 16]: He also met with much difficulty at first , in making his information properly appreciated .
Parsing [sent. 3168 len. 30]: He sought to increase their comforts -- to introduce agricultural implements of a more useful description , and to lead them generally towards the conveniences and decencies of civilisation .
Parsing [sent. 3169 len. 33]: He built himself a house , and planted a garden , and cultivated some land , in which he shewed the superior advantages of what he knew , to what they practised .
Parsing [sent. 3170 len. 16]: They seemed to marvel much , but continued to go on in their own way .
Parsing [sent. 3171 len. 111]: `` He also went amongst them as a physician , and having acquired considerable knowledge of medicine and simple surgery , he was enabled to work some cures in fevers and spear wounds , that in course of time made for him so great a reputation , that many of the leading chiefs sent for him when anything ailed them or their families , and they were so well satisfied with what he did for them , that he began to be looked upon as one who was to be treated with particular respect and honour , by all classes of the natives , from the highest to the lowest .
Parsing [sent. 3172 len. 10]: `` On one occasion the king required his services .
Parsing [sent. 3173 len. 20]: He was suffering from a sort of cholic , for which the native doctors could give him no relief .
Parsing [sent. 3174 len. 72]: My husband administered some medicines , and stayed with his Majesty until they had the desired effect , and the result being a complete recovery , seemed so astonishing to all the members of his Sandwich Majesty 's court , that the doctor was required to administer the same medicine to every one , from the queen to the humblest of her attendants , though all were apparently in good health .
Parsing [sent. 3175 len. 37]: He managed to satisfy them with a small portion only of the mixture , which he was quite certain could do them no harm : and they professed to be wonderfully the better for it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3176 len. 19]: Chapter XXXVIII `` His reputation had now grown so great , that whatever he required was readily granted .
Parsing [sent. 3177 len. 52]: He first desired to have some children sent him ; to learn those things which had enabled him to do so much good , and this having been readily sanctioned , we opened a school for girls and boys , in which we taught the first elements of a civilised education .
Parsing [sent. 3178 len. 23]: `` Finding we made fair progress in this way , we commenced developing our real object , the inculcation of Christian sentiments .
Parsing [sent. 3179 len. 38]: This meeting with no opposition , and Reichardt having established a powerful influence over the entire community , he next proceeded with the parents , and earnestly strove to induce them to embrace the profession of Christianity .
Parsing [sent. 3180 len. 8]: `` His labours were not entirely unproductive .
Parsing [sent. 3181 len. 62]: There began to prevail amongst the islanders , a disposition to hear the wondrous discourses of this stranger , and he was employed , day after day , in explaining to large and attentive audiences , the history of the Christian world , and the observances and doctrine of that faith which had been cemented by the blood of the Redeemer .
Parsing [sent. 3182 len. 43]: The new and startling subjects of his discourse , as well as the impressive character of his eloquence , frequently deeply moved his hearers ; and at his revelations they would often burst forth into piercing shouts and loud expressions of amazement .
Parsing [sent. 3183 len. 9]: `` In truth it was a moving scene .
Parsing [sent. 3184 len. 78]: The noble figure of the Missionary , with his fine features lighted up with the fire of holy enthusiasm , surrounded by a crowd of dusky savages , armed with spears and war clubs , and partly clothed with feathers , in their features shewing traces of unusual excitement , and every now and then joining in a wild chorus , expressive of their wonder , could not have been witnessed by any Christian , without emotion .
Parsing [sent. 3185 len. 20]: `` But when the ceremony of Baptism was first performed before them , their amazement was increased a thousandfold .
Parsing [sent. 3186 len. 48]: The first member of our flock was Hooloo , whom I had instructed so far , in the principles of our faith , and I had acquired such an influence over her mind , that she readily consented to abandon her idolatrous customs and become a Christian .
Parsing [sent. 3187 len. 126]: `` After a suitable address to the natives , who had assembled in some thousands to witness the spectacle , in which he explained to them the motive and object of baptism , my husband assisted the girl down a sloping green bank which led to a beautiful stream , and walked with her into the water till he was up to his waist ; then , after offering up a long and fervent prayer that this first victory over the false worship of the Devil , might be the forerunner of the entire extirpation of idolatry from the land , he , plunging her into the water , baptised her in the name of the Father , the Son , and the Holy Ghost .
Parsing [sent. 3188 len. 63]: `` All the people were awed to silence while the ceremony proceeded , but when it was over they burst forth into a loud cry , and came down to meet the new Christian and my husband as they came out of the water , and waved over them boughs of trees , and danced and shouted as though in an ecstasy .
Parsing [sent. 3189 len. 44]: `` We however had not proceeded to this extent , without exciting considerable opposition ; our disrespect towards their idols had given great offence to those who were identified with the superstitions of the people , and flourished according as these were supported .
Parsing [sent. 3190 len. 39]: Complaints were made too of our teaching a new religion , in opposition to the gods they and their fathers had worshipped , and a powerful party was got together for the purpose of pursuing us to destruction .
Parsing [sent. 3191 len. 62]: `` My husband was summoned before a council of the great chiefs , to hear the accusations that had been brought against him : and the old idolaters got up and abused him , and threatened him with the punishment of their monstrous gods , for telling lies to the people , and deceiving them with forged tales and strange customs .
Parsing [sent. 3192 len. 67]: `` They sought all they could , to move the judges against him , by painting the terrible fate that would befall them if they failed to kill the white stranger , who had insulted their gods ; and they predicted hosts of calamities that were to happen , in consequence of their having allowed the teller of lies to work so much mischief against them .
Parsing [sent. 3193 len. 59]: `` My husband then being called upon for his defence , first declared to the judges the attributes of the Deity he worshipped : that he created the vast heavens , the stars , the mountains , the rivers , and the sea ; his voice spoke in the thunder , and his eye flashed in the lightning .
Parsing [sent. 3194 len. 41]: He then dwelt on his goodness to man , especially to the Sandwich Islanders , whom he had created for the purpose of enjoying the fine country around them and of beholding the beauty of the heavens where he dwelt .
Parsing [sent. 3195 len. 86]: Then he referred to the gods they had worshipped , and asked how they were made , and what such senseless things could do for them ; commenting on their inability to serve them , in any way , or do them any harm ; and went on to speak of the benefits he had been able to confer upon them , through the influence of the all powerful God he worshipped ; and asked them if he had ever done them anything but good .
Parsing [sent. 3196 len. 30]: Lastly , he promised them innumerable benefits , if they would leave their useless gods , and turn to the only God who had the power to serve them .
Parsing [sent. 3197 len. 20]: `` It is impossible for me to do justice to the animated manner in which he delivered this discourse .
Parsing [sent. 3198 len. 35]: It produced great effect upon the majority of his hearers ; but there was a powerful minority it still more strongly influenced against him ; and they continued to interrupt him with terrible outcries .
Parsing [sent. 3199 len. 13]: `` Most of the leading chiefs were against his suffering any harm .
Parsing [sent. 3200 len. 35]: They bore in mind the advantages he had conferred , by his skill in medicine , and superior wisdom in various other things , which the people would lose were he put to death .
Parsing [sent. 3201 len. 27]: They also remembered the hope he held out of future benefits , which of course they could not expect , if they offered him any violence .
Parsing [sent. 3202 len. 37]: `` The result was , that my husband was suffered to go harmless from the meeting , to the great disappointment of his enemies , who could scarcely be kept from laying violent hands upon him .
Parsing [sent. 3203 len. 15]: The danger he had escaped , unfortunately , did not render him more prudent .
Parsing [sent. 3204 len. 4]: Far from it .
Parsing [sent. 3205 len. 43]: He believed that he was a chosen instrument of the Most High , to win these savages from the depths of idolatry and Paganism ; and continued , on every occasion that presented itself , to endeavour to win souls to God .
Parsing [sent. 3206 len. 35]: `` The school increased , several of the parents suffered themselves to be baptised , and there was a regular observance of the Lord 's Day amongst those who belonged to our little flock .
Parsing [sent. 3207 len. 24]: Even many of the islanders , although they did not become Christians , attended our religious services , and spoke well of us .
Parsing [sent. 3208 len. 62]: `` We brought up the young people to be able to teach their brethren and sisters ; and hoped to be able to establish missions in other parts of the island , to which we sometimes made excursions ; preaching the inestimable blessings of the gospel to the islanders , and exhorting them to abandon their dark customs and heathen follies .
Parsing [sent. 3209 len. 48]: I was not far behind my husband in this good work , and acquired as much influence among the women as he exercised over the men : indeed we were generally looked upon as holy people , who deserved to be treated with veneration and respect . ''
Parsing [sent. 3210 len. 74]: Chapter XXXIX `` Things went on in this flourishing way for several years ; my husband , deeply impressed with the responsibility of his position , as a chosen servant of God , devoted himself so entirely to the great work he had undertaken , that he often seemed to overlook the claims upon his attention of her he had chosen as his partner , in his struggle against the Powers of Darkness .
Parsing [sent. 3211 len. 31]: Sometimes I did not see him for several days ; and often when we were together , he was so abstracted , he did not seem aware I was present .
Parsing [sent. 3212 len. 30]: Whenever I could get him to speak of himself , he would dilate on the unspeakable felicity that he felt in drawing nearer to the end of his work .
Parsing [sent. 3213 len. 41]: I affected not to know to what he alluded ; but I always felt that he was referring to the impression he entertained of his own speedy dissolution , which he had taken up when he first embraced this mission .
Parsing [sent. 3214 len. 75]: `` I tried to get rid of my misgivings by recalling the dangers and difficulties we had triumphantly passed , and referring to the encouraging state of things that existed at the present time ; nevertheless , I could not prevent a sinking of the heart , whenever I heard him venture upon the subject ; and when he was absent from me , I often experienced an agony of anxiety till his return .
Parsing [sent. 3215 len. 40]: I saw , however , no real cause of apprehension , and endeavoured to persuade myself none existed ; and very probably I should have succeeded , had not my husband so frequently indulged in references to our separation .
Parsing [sent. 3216 len. 37]: `` Alas , '' she exclaimed , mournfully , `` he was better informed than I was of the proximity of that Celestial Home , for which he had been so long and zealously preparing himself .
Parsing [sent. 3217 len. 66]: He , doubtless , had his intimation from on high , that his translation to the realms of bliss , was no remote consequence of his undertaking the mission he had accepted ; and he had familiarised his mind to it as a daily duty , and by his constant references had sought to prepare me for the catastrophe he knew to be inevitable . ''
Parsing [sent. 3218 len. 21]: Here Mrs Reichardt became so sensibly affected , that it was some time before she could proceed with her narrative .
Parsing [sent. 3219 len. 43]: She , however , did so at last , yet I could see by the tears that traced each other down her wan cheeks , how much her soul was moved by the terrible details into which she was obliged to enter .
Parsing [sent. 3220 len. 79]: `` In the midst of our success , '' she presently resumed , `` when we had established a congregation , had baptised hundreds of men , women , and children , had completed a regular place of worship , and an extensive school-house , both of which were fully and regularly attended , some European vessel paid us a short visit , soon after which , that dreadful scourge the small-pox , broke out amongst the people .
Parsing [sent. 3221 len. 18]: Both children and adults were seized , and as soon as one died a dozen were attacked .
Parsing [sent. 3222 len. 29]: `` Soon the greatest alarm pervaded the natives ; my husband was implored to stop the pestilence , which power they felt convinced he had in his hands .
Parsing [sent. 3223 len. 18]: He did all that was possible for him to do , but that unfortunately was very little .
Parsing [sent. 3224 len. 13]: His recommendation of remedial measures was rarely attended with the desired results .
Parsing [sent. 3225 len. 5]: Death was very busy .
Parsing [sent. 3226 len. 61]: The people died in scores , and the survivors , excited by the vindictive men who had formerly sought his death for disparaging their gods , began not only to fall off rapidly in their regard and reverence for my husband , but murmurs first , and execrations afterwards , and violent menaces subsequently , attended him whenever he appeared .
Parsing [sent. 3227 len. 19]: `` He preached to them resignation to the Divine Will ; but resignation was not a savage virtue .
Parsing [sent. 3228 len. 24]: He was indefatigable in his attentions to the sick ; but those of whom he was most careful seemed the speediest to die .
Parsing [sent. 3229 len. 73]: The popular feeling against him increased every hour ; he appeared , however , to defy his fate -- walking unconcernedly amongst crowds of infuriated savages brandishing heavy clubs , and threatening him with the points of their sharp spears ; but his eye never blinked , and his cheek never blanched , and he walked on his way inwardly praising God , careless of the evil passions that raged around him .
Parsing [sent. 3230 len. 52]: `` It was on a Sabbath morn -- our service had far advanced ; we could boast of but a limited congregation , for many had died , some had fled from the pestilence into the interior ; others had avoided the place in consequence of the threats of their countrymen .
Parsing [sent. 3231 len. 18]: A few children , and two or three women , were all their teacher had to address .
Parsing [sent. 3232 len. 60]: `` We were engaged in singing a Psalm , when a furious crowd , mad with rage , as it seemed , screaming and yelling in the most frightful manner , and brandishing their weapons as though about to attack an enemy , burst into our little chapel , and seized my husband in the midst of his devotions .
Parsing [sent. 3233 len. 57]: `` I rushed forward to protect him from the numerous weapons that were aimed at his life , but was dragged back by the hair of my head ; and with infuriate cries and gestures , that made them look like demons broke loose from hell , they fell upon him with their clubs and spears .
Parsing [sent. 3234 len. 36]: `` Reichardt made no resistance , he merely clasped his hands the more firmly , and looked up to Heaven the more devoutly , as he continued the Psalm he had commenced before they entered .
Parsing [sent. 3235 len. 7]: This did not delay his fate .
Parsing [sent. 3236 len. 48]: `` They beat out his brains so close to me , that I was covered with his blood , and I believe I should have shared the same fate , had I not fainted with terror at the horrible scene of which I was a forced spectator .
Parsing [sent. 3237 len. 27]: `` I learned afterwards that some powerful chief interfered , and I was carried away more dead than alive , in which state I long remained .
Parsing [sent. 3238 len. 30]: As soon as I became sufficiently strong to be moved , I took advantage of a whaler calling at the island , homeward bound , to beg a passage .
Parsing [sent. 3239 len. 27]: The captain heard my lamentable story , took me on board as soon as he could , and shewed a seaman 's sympathy for my sufferings .
Parsing [sent. 3240 len. 41]: `` I was to have returned to England with him , but off this place we encountered a terrible storm , in which we were obliged to take to the boats , as the only chance of saving our lives .
Parsing [sent. 3241 len. 20]: What became of him I know not , as the two boats parted company soon after leaving the wreck .
Parsing [sent. 3242 len. 29]: I trust he managed to reach the land in safety , and is now in his own country , enjoying all the comforts that can make life covetable .
Parsing [sent. 3243 len. 31]: `` What became of that part of the crew that brought me here in the other boat , led by the fires you had lighted , I am in doubt .
Parsing [sent. 3244 len. 40]: But I think on quitting the island , crowded as their boat was , and in the state of its crew , it was scarcely possible for them to have made the distant island for which they steered . ''
Parsing [sent. 3245 len. 13]: Chapter XL Mrs Reichardt 's story made a sensible impression on me .
Parsing [sent. 3246 len. 45]: I no longer wondered at the pallor of her countenance , or the air of melancholy that at first seemed so remarkable ; she had suffered most severely , and her sufferings were too recent not to have left their effects upon her frame .
Parsing [sent. 3247 len. 61]: I thought a good deal about her narrative , and wondered much that men could be got to leave their comfortable homes , and travel thousands and thousands of miles across the fathomless seas , with the hope of converting a nation of treacherous savages , by whom they were sure to be slaughtered at the first outbreak of ill-feeling .
Parsing [sent. 3248 len. 23]: I could not but admire the character of Reichardt -- in all his actions he had exhibited a marked nobility of nature .
Parsing [sent. 3249 len. 79]: He would not present himself before the woman who had the strongest claims upon his gratitude , till he had obtained a position and a reputation that should , in his opinion , make him worthy of her ; and though he had a presentiment of the fate that would overtake him , he fulfilled his duties as a missionary with a holy enthusiasm that made him regard his approaching martyrdom as the greatest of all earthly distinctions .
Parsing [sent. 3250 len. 12]: I felt regret that I had not known such a man .
Parsing [sent. 3251 len. 14]: I knew how much I had lost in having missed such an example .
Parsing [sent. 3252 len. 16]: My having heard this story led me into much private communing with myself respecting religion .
Parsing [sent. 3253 len. 44]: I could consider myself little better than a savage , like the brutal Sandwich Islanders ; my conduct to Jackson had been only in a degree less inhuman than that these idolaters had shewn to their teacher when he was in their power .
Parsing [sent. 3254 len. 55]: I fancied at the time that I served him right , for his villainous conduct to my father , and brutal conduct to me : but God having punished him for his misdeeds , I felt satisfied I had no business to put him to greater torment as satisfaction for my own private injuries .
Parsing [sent. 3255 len. 36]: I fancied God might have been angry with me , and had kept me on the island as a punishment for my offences ; and I had some conversation with Mrs Reichardt on this point .
Parsing [sent. 3256 len. 54]: `` Nothing , '' she observed , `` can excuse your ill-feeling towards Jackson ; he was a bad man , without a doubt , and he deserved condign punishment for his usage of your parents ; but the Divine founder of our religion has urged us to return good for evil . ''
Parsing [sent. 3257 len. 32]: `` Yes , '' I answered readily , `` but I should have suffered as bad as my father and mother , had I not prevented his doing me mischief . ''
Parsing [sent. 3258 len. 15]: `` You do not know that you were to suffer , '' she replied .
Parsing [sent. 3259 len. 38]: `` Jackson , without such terrible punishment as he brought upon himself , might eventually have become contrite , and have restored you to your friends as well as enabled you to obtain your grandfather 's property .
Parsing [sent. 3260 len. 36]: God frequently performs marvellous things with such humble instruments , for he hath said , ` There is more joy in heaven over one sinner that repenteth , than over ninety-nine just men . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 3261 len. 17]: `` Surely , this is raising the wicked man over the good , '' I cried .
Parsing [sent. 3262 len. 9]: `` Not at all , '' she replied .
Parsing [sent. 3263 len. 35]: `` The repentant is one gained from the ranks of the great enemy -- it is as one that was lost and is found again -- it is a soul added to the blessed .
Parsing [sent. 3264 len. 12]: Therefore the joy in heaven is abundant at such a conversion .
Parsing [sent. 3265 len. 60]: The just are the natural heirs of heaven -- their rights are acknowledged without dispute -- their claim is at once recognised and allowed , and they receive their portion of eternal joy as a matter of course , without there being any necessity for exciting those demonstrations of satisfaction which hail the advent of a sinner saved . ''
Parsing [sent. 3266 len. 21]: `` I do n't think such a villain as Jackson would ever go to heaven , '' I observed . ''
Parsing [sent. 3267 len. 44]: ` Judge not , lest ye be judged , ' '' she answered ; `` that is a text that can not be too often impressed upon persons anxious to condemn to eternal torment all those they believe to be worse than themselves .
Parsing [sent. 3268 len. 20]: It is great presumption in us poor creatures of clay , to anticipate the proceedings of the Infinite Wisdom .
Parsing [sent. 3269 len. 81]: Let us leave the high prerogative of judgment to the Almighty Power , by whom only it is exercised , and in our opinions of even the worst of our fellow-creatures , let us exercise a comprehensive charity , mingled with a prayer that even at the eleventh hour , they may have turned from the evil of their ways , and embraced the prospect of salvation , which the mercy of their Creator has held out to them . ''
Parsing [sent. 3270 len. 51]: In this and similar conversations , Mrs Reichardt would endeavour to plant in my mind the soundest views of religion ; and she spoke so well , and so convincingly , that I had little trouble in understanding her meaning , or in retaining it after it had been uttered .
Parsing [sent. 3271 len. 31]: It was not , as I have before stated , to religion only that she led my thoughts , although that certainly was the most frequent subject of our conversation .
Parsing [sent. 3272 len. 68]: She sought to instruct me in the various branches of knowledge into which she had acquired some insight , and in this way I picked up as much information respecting grammar , geography , astronomy , writing , arithmetic , history , and morals , as I should have gained had I been at a school , instead of being forced to remain on a desolate island .
Parsing [sent. 3273 len. 12]: I need not say that I still desired to leave it .
Parsing [sent. 3274 len. 28]: I had long been tired of the place , notwithstanding that from our united exertions , we enjoyed many comforts which we could not have hoped for .
Parsing [sent. 3275 len. 84]: Our hut we had metamorphosed into something Mrs Reichardt styled a rustic cottage , which , covered as it was with flowers and creepers , really looked very pretty ; and the garden added greatly to its pleasant appearance : for near the house we had transplanted everything that bore a flower that could be found in the island , and had planted some shrubs , that , having been carefully nurtured made rapid growth , and screened the hut from the wind .
Parsing [sent. 3276 len. 95]: I had built a sort of out-house for storing potatoes and firewood , and a fowl-house for the gannets , which were now a numerous flock ; and had planted a fence round the garden , so that as Mrs Reichardt said , we looked as if we had selected a dwelling in our own beloved England , in the heart of a rural district , instead of our being circumscribed in a little island thousands of miles across the wide seas , from the home of which we were so fond of talking .
Parsing [sent. 3277 len. 74]: Although my companion always spoke warmly of the land of her birth , and evidently would have been glad to return to it , she never grieved over her hard fate in being , as it were , a prisoner on a rock , out of reach of friends and kindred ; indeed , she used to chide me for being impatient of my detention , and insensible of the blessings I enjoyed .
Parsing [sent. 3278 len. 11]: `` What temptations are we not free from here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3279 len. 4]: she would say .
Parsing [sent. 3280 len. 23]: `` We see nothing of the world ; we can not be contaminated with its vices , or suffer from its follies .
Parsing [sent. 3281 len. 22]: The hideous wars -- the terrible revolutions -- the dreadful visitations of famine and pestilence -- are completely unknown to us .
Parsing [sent. 3282 len. 21]: Robbery , and murder , and fraud , and the thousand other phases of human wickedness , we altogether escape .
Parsing [sent. 3283 len. 94]: There was a time , when men , for the purpose of leading holy lives , abandoned the fair cities in which they had lived in the enjoyment of every luxury , and sought a cave in some distant desert , where , in the lair of some wild beast , with a stone for a pillow , a handful of herbs for a meal , and a cup of water for beveridge , they lived out the remnant of their days in a constant succession of mortifications , prayers , and penitence .
Parsing [sent. 3284 len. 14]: `` How different , '' she added , `` is our own state .
Parsing [sent. 3285 len. 32]: We are as far removed from the sinfulness of the world as any hermit of the desert , whilst we have the enjoyment of comforts to which they were strangers . ''
Parsing [sent. 3286 len. 57]: `` But probably , '' I observed , `` these men were penitents , and went into the desert as much to punish their bodies for the transgressions of the flesh , as to acquire by solitary communion , a better knowledge of the spirit than they were likely to obtain in their old haunts . ''
Parsing [sent. 3287 len. 67]: `` Some were penitents , no doubt , '' she answered , `` but they , having obtained by their sanctity an extraordinary reputation , induced others , whose lives had been blameless , to follow their example , and in time the desert became colonised with recluses , who rivalled each other in the intensity of their devotions and the extent of their privations . ''
Parsing [sent. 3288 len. 47]: `` Would it not have been more commendable , '' I asked , `` if these men had remained in the community to which they belonged , withstanding temptation , and been employed in labour that was creditable to themselves and useful to their country ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3289 len. 67]: `` No doubt it would , '' she replied ; `` but religion has , unfortunately , too often been the result of impulse rather than conviction ; and at the period to which we are referring , it was thought that sinful human nature could only gain the attributes of saintship by neglecting its social duties , and punishing its humanity in the severest manner .
Parsing [sent. 3290 len. 71]: Even in more recent times , and at the present day , in Catholic countries , it is customary for individuals of both sexes , to abandon the world of which they might render themselves ornaments , and shut themselves up in buildings constructed expressly to receive them , where they continue to go through a course of devotions and privations till death puts an end to their voluntary imprisonment .
Parsing [sent. 3291 len. 23]: `` In this modified instance of seclusion , '' she added , `` there are features very different from our own case .
Parsing [sent. 3292 len. 22]: We are not forced to impoverish our blood with insufficient diet , or mortify our flesh with various forms of punishment .
Parsing [sent. 3293 len. 9]: We do not neglect the worship of God .
Parsing [sent. 3294 len. 73]: We offer up daily thanks for his loving care of us , and sing his praises in continual hymns : and instead of wasting the hours of the day in unmeaning penances , we fill up our time in employments that add to our health , comfort , and happiness : and that enable us the better to appreciate the goodness of that Power who is so mindful of our welfare . ''
Parsing [sent. 3295 len. 13]: `` Have you no wish then , to leave this island ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3296 len. 3]: I inquired .
Parsing [sent. 3297 len. 23]: `` I should gladly avail myself of the first opportunity that presented itself for getting safely to England , '' she replied .
Parsing [sent. 3298 len. 10]: `` But I would wait patiently the proper time .
Parsing [sent. 3299 len. 28]: It is not only useless repining at our prolonged stay here , but it looks like an ungrateful doubting of the power of God to remove us .
Parsing [sent. 3300 len. 31]: Be assured that he has not preserved us so long , and through so many dangers , to abandon us when we most require his interposition in our favour . ''
Parsing [sent. 3301 len. 44]: I endeavoured to gather consolation from such representations : but perhaps young people are not so easily reconciled to what they do not like , as are their elders , for I can not say I succeeded in becoming satisfied with my position .
Parsing [sent. 3302 len. 61]: Chapter XLI The perils of my first voyage had deterred me from making a similar experiment ; but I recovered my boat , and having further strengthened it , fitted it with what could either be turned into a well or locker : I used to row out a little distance when the sea was free from sharks and fish .
Parsing [sent. 3303 len. 26]: But my grand effort in this direction was the completion of a net , which , assisted by Mrs Reichardt , I managed to manufacture .
Parsing [sent. 3304 len. 39]: By this time she had gained sufficient confidence to accompany me in my fishing excursions ; she would even take the oars whilst I threw out the net , and assisted me in dragging it into the boat .
Parsing [sent. 3305 len. 21]: The first time we got such a haul , that I was afraid of the safety of our little craft .
Parsing [sent. 3306 len. 31]: The locker was full , and numbers of great fish , as I flung them out of the net , were flapping and leaping about the bottom of the boat .
Parsing [sent. 3307 len. 35]: It began to sink lower in the water than was agreeable to either of us , and I found it absolutely necessary to throw back into the sea the greater portion of our catch .
Parsing [sent. 3308 len. 29]: We then rowed carefully to land , rejoicing that we had at our command , the means of obtaining an abundant supply of food whenever we desired it .
Parsing [sent. 3309 len. 11]: Mrs Reichardt was with me also in our land excursions .
Parsing [sent. 3310 len. 73]: Together we had explored every part of the island ; our chief object was plants for enriching our garden , and often as we had been in search of novelties , we invariably brought home additions to our collection ; and my companion having acquired some knowledge of botany , would explain to me the names , characters , and qualities of the different species , which made our journeys peculiarly interesting .
Parsing [sent. 3311 len. 26]: Our appearance often caused considerable amusement to each other ; for our respective costumes must have been extremely curious in the eyes of a stranger .
Parsing [sent. 3312 len. 49]: Neither wore shoes or stockings -- these things we did not possess , and could not procure ; we wore leggings and sandals of seal skin to protect us from the thorns and plants of the cacti tribe , among which we were obliged to force our way .
Parsing [sent. 3313 len. 31]: My companion wore a conical cap of seal skin , and protected her complexion from the sun , by a rude attempt at an umbrella I had made for her .
Parsing [sent. 3314 len. 77]: She had on , on these occasions , a pair of coarse cloth trousers , as her own dress would have been torn to pieces before she had got half a mile through the bush ; these were surmounted by a tight spencer she had herself manufactured out of a man 's waistcoat , and a dimity petticoat , which buttoned up to her throat , and was fastened in the same way at the wrists .
Parsing [sent. 3315 len. 20]: My head was covered with a broad-brimmed hat , made of dry grass , which I had myself platted .
Parsing [sent. 3316 len. 28]: I wore a sailor 's jacket , much the worse for wear , patched with seal skin , over a pair of duck trousers , similarly repaired .
Parsing [sent. 3317 len. 14]: Although our expeditions were perfectly harmless , we did not go without weapons .
Parsing [sent. 3318 len. 45]: At the instigation of my companion , I had made myself a good stout bow and plenty of arrows , and had exercised myself so frequently at aiming at a mark , as to have acquired very considerable skill in the use of them .
Parsing [sent. 3319 len. 48]: I had now several arrows of hard wood tipped with sharp fish-bones , and some with iron nails , in a kind of pouch behind me ; in its sheath before me was my American knife , which I used for taking the plants from the ground .
Parsing [sent. 3320 len. 33]: I had a basket made of the long grass of the island , slung around me , which served to contain our treasures ; and I carried my bow in my hand .
Parsing [sent. 3321 len. 58]: My companion , in addition to her umbrella , bore only a long staff , and a small basket tied round her waist that usually contained a little refreshment ; for she would say there was no knowing what might occur to delay our return , and therefore it was better to take our meal with us .
Parsing [sent. 3322 len. 83]: And not the least agreeable portion of the day 's labour was our repast ; for we would seat ourselves in some quiet corner , surrounded by flowers , and shaded by the brushwood from the sun , and there eat our dried fish or pick our birds , and roast our potatoes by means of a fire of dried sticks , and wash down our simple dinner with a flask of pure water -- the most refreshing portion of our banquet .
Parsing [sent. 3323 len. 43]: I had , as I have just stated , attained a singular degree of skill in the use of the bow and arrow , which , as we had no fire-arms , was often of important service in procuring food on land .
Parsing [sent. 3324 len. 22]: I had made another use of my skill -- an application of it which afforded me a vast deal of satisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 3325 len. 72]: My old enemies the sharks used still to frequent a certain portion of the coast in great numbers , and as soon as I became master of my weapon , I would stand as near to the edge of the rock as was safe , and singling out my victim , aim at his upper fin , which I often found had the effect of ridding the place of that fellow .
Parsing [sent. 3326 len. 62]: I bore such an intense hatred to these creatures , for the fright they had put me into during my memorable voyage of discovery , and for the slaughter of my beloved Nero , that I determined to wage incessant war against them , as long as I could manufacture an arrow , or a single shark remained on the coast .
Parsing [sent. 3327 len. 17]: As we had so often traversed the island without accident , we dreamt not of danger .
Parsing [sent. 3328 len. 23]: We had never met with any kind of animals , except our old friends the seals , who kept near the sea .
Parsing [sent. 3329 len. 37]: Of birds , the gannets were generally the sole frequenters of the island ; but we had seen , at rare intervals , birds of a totally different character , some of which I had shot .
Parsing [sent. 3330 len. 30]: Indeed , during our excursions , I was always on the look out for any stranger of the feathered race , that I might exercise my skill upon him .
Parsing [sent. 3331 len. 38]: If he proved eatable , he was sure to be very welcome ; and even if he could not be cooked , he afforded me some entertainment , in hearing from Mrs Reichardt his name and habits .
Parsing [sent. 3332 len. 34]: We had discovered a natural hollow which lay so low that it was quite hid till we came close to it , when we had to descend a steep declivity covered with shrubs .
Parsing [sent. 3333 len. 39]: At the bottom was a soil evidently very productive , for we found trees growing there to a considerable height , that were in marked contrast to the shrubby plants that grew in other parts of the island .
Parsing [sent. 3334 len. 15]: We called this spot the Happy Valley , and it became a favourite resting-place .
Parsing [sent. 3335 len. 57]: I remember on one of these occasions , we had made our dinner after having been several hours employed in seeking for plants , of which we had procured a good supply , and the remains of our meal lay under a great tree , beneath the spreading branches of which we had been resting ourselves .
Parsing [sent. 3336 len. 22]: It was quite on the other side of the island , within about a quarter of a mile from the sea .
Parsing [sent. 3337 len. 24]: Abundance of curious plants grew about the place , and Mrs Reichardt had wandered to a little distance to examine all within view .
Parsing [sent. 3338 len. 15]: I was peering into the trees and shrubs around to discover a new comer .
Parsing [sent. 3339 len. 42]: I had wandered in an opposite direction to that taken by my companion , and was creeping round a clump of shrubs about twenty yards off , in which I detected a chirping noise , when I heard a loud scream .
Parsing [sent. 3340 len. 23]: I turned sharply round and beheld Mrs Reichardt , evidently in an agony of terror , running towards me with prodigious swiftness .
Parsing [sent. 3341 len. 33]: She had dropped her umbrella and her staff , her cap had fallen from her head , and her long hair , disarranged by her sudden flight , streamed behind her shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 3342 len. 55]: At first I did not see anything which could have caused this terrible alarm , but in a few seconds I heard a crushing among a thicket of shrubs from which she was running , as if some heavy weight was being forced through them ; and presently there issued a most extraordinary monster .
Parsing [sent. 3343 len. 39]: It came forward at a quick pace , its head erect above ten feet , its jaws wide open , from the midst of which there issued a forked tongue which darted in and out with inconceivable rapidity .
Parsing [sent. 3344 len. 50]: Its body was very long , and thick as an ordinary tree ; it was covered over with bright shining scales that seemed to have different colours , and was propelled along the ground in folds of various sizes , with a length of tail of several yards behind .
Parsing [sent. 3345 len. 8]: Its eyes were very bright and fierce .
Parsing [sent. 3346 len. 10]: Its appearance certainly accounted for my companion 's alarm .
Parsing [sent. 3347 len. 4]: `` Fly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3348 len. 23]: she cried in accents of intense terror , as she rushed towards me , `` fly , or you are lost ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3349 len. 43]: She then gave a hurried glance behind her , and seeing the formidable monster in full chase , she just had power to reach the spot to which I had advanced , and sunk overpowered with terror , fainting at my feet .
Parsing [sent. 3350 len. 61]: My first movement was to step across her body for the purpose of disputing the passage of the monster , and in an erect posture , with my bow drawn tight as I could pull it , I waited a few seconds till I could secure a good aim , for I knew everything depended on my steadiness and resolution .
Parsing [sent. 3351 len. 59]: On came my prodigious antagonist , making a terrible hissing as he approached , his eyes flashing , his jaws expanded as if he intended to swallow me at a mouthful , and the enormous folds of his huge body passing like wheels over the ground , crushing the thick plants that came in their way like grass .
Parsing [sent. 3352 len. 47]: I must acknowledge that in my heart I felt a strange sinking sensation , but I remembered that our only chance of escape lay in giving the monster a mortal wound , and the imminence of the danger seemed to afford me the resolution I required .
Parsing [sent. 3353 len. 28]: He was close behind , and in a direct line with the tree under which we had dined , and I was about twenty yards from it .
Parsing [sent. 3354 len. 45]: Directly his head darted round and in front of the tree , making a good mark , I let fly the arrow direct , as I thought , for his eye , hoping , by penetrating his brain , to settle him at once .
Parsing [sent. 3355 len. 40]: But as he moved his head at that moment , the arrow went into his open jaws , one of which it penetrated , and going deep into the tree behind , pinned his head close to the bark .
Parsing [sent. 3356 len. 43]: As soon as the huge creature found himself hurt , he wound his enormous body round the trunk , and with his desperate exertions swayed the great tree backwards and forwards , as I would have done one of its smallest branches .
Parsing [sent. 3357 len. 34]: Fearful that he would liberate himself before I could save my senseless companion , as quick as possible I discharged all my arrows into his body , which took effect in various places .
Parsing [sent. 3358 len. 43]: His exertions then became so terrible that I hastily snatched up Mrs Reichardt in my arms , and with a fright that seemed to give me supernatural strength , I ran as fast as I could the shortest way to our hut .
Parsing [sent. 3359 len. 25]: Fortunately , before I had gone half a mile , my companion came to her senses , and was able to continue her flight .
Parsing [sent. 3360 len. 26]: We got home at last , half dead with fatigue and fright ; nevertheless the first thing we did was to barricade all the entrances .
Parsing [sent. 3361 len. 26]: We left loop-holes to reconnoitre ; and there we sat for hours after our arrival , waiting the monster 's approach in fear and trembling .
Parsing [sent. 3362 len. 9]: We did not go to sleep that night .
Parsing [sent. 3363 len. 14]: We did not , either of us , go out the next day .
Parsing [sent. 3364 len. 10]: The next night one watched while the other slept .
Parsing [sent. 3365 len. 24]: The second day my courage had so far returned , I wanted to go and look after the constant subject of our conversation .
Parsing [sent. 3366 len. 6]: But Mrs Reichardt dissuaded me .
Parsing [sent. 3367 len. 26]: She told me it was an enormous python , or serpent of the boa species , that are common on the northern coast of America .
Parsing [sent. 3368 len. 54]: Probably it had been brought to the island on a drifted tree , and being so prodigious a reptile , the wounds it had received were not likely to do it much harm , and it would be no doubt lurking about , ready to pounce upon either of us directly we appeared .
Parsing [sent. 3369 len. 100]: On the third day , nothing having occurred to increase our alarm , I determined to know the worst ; so I got by stealth out of the house , and armed with a fresh bow , a good supply of arrows , a hatchet slung at my side , and my American knife -- with my mind made up for another conflict if necessary -- I crept stealthily along , with my eyes awake to the slightest motion , and my ears open to the slightest sound , till I approached the scene of my late unequal struggle .
Parsing [sent. 3370 len. 33]: I must own I began to draw my breath rather rapidly , and my heart beat more quickly , as I came near the place where I had left my terrible enemy .
Parsing [sent. 3371 len. 9]: To my extreme surprise the python had disappeared .
Parsing [sent. 3372 len. 28]: There was a tree still standing , though its foliage and branches strewed the ground , and a great portion of its bark was ground to powder .
Parsing [sent. 3373 len. 25]: At the base of the trunk was a pool of blood mingled with fragments of bark , broken arrows , leaves , and mould .
Parsing [sent. 3374 len. 5]: The reptile had escaped .
Parsing [sent. 3375 len. 5]: But where was he ?
Parsing [sent. 3376 len. 20]: Not altogether without anxiety I began to look for traces of his retreat ; and they were easily found .
Parsing [sent. 3377 len. 47]: With my arrow ready for immediate flight , I followed a stream of blood that was still visible on the grass , and led from the tree , accompanied by unmistakable marks of the great serpent 's progress , in a direct line to the sea .
Parsing [sent. 3378 len. 4]: There it disappeared .
Parsing [sent. 3379 len. 9]: When I discovered this , I breathed again .
Parsing [sent. 3380 len. 36]: There was no doubt if the monster survived the conflict , he was hundreds of miles away , and was not likely to return to a place where he had received so rough a welcome .
Parsing [sent. 3381 len. 18]: It may readily be believed I lost no time in taking the agreeable news to my companion .
Parsing [sent. 3382 len. 13]: Chapter XLII I had become tired of looking out for a ship .
Parsing [sent. 3383 len. 30]: Though day after day , and week after week , I made the most careful scrutiny with my glass , as I have said , it brought no result .
Parsing [sent. 3384 len. 44]: I sometimes fancied I saw a vessel appearing in the line of the horizon , and I would pile up faggots and light them , and throw on water to make them smoke , as Jackson had done ; but all without avail .
Parsing [sent. 3385 len. 30]: Either my vision had deceived me , or my signals had not been observed , or the ship 's course did not lie in the direction of the island .
Parsing [sent. 3386 len. 19]: We had had storms too on several occasions , but no wreck had been left on our coast .
Parsing [sent. 3387 len. 46]: I began to think we were doomed to live out our lives on this rock , and frequently found myself striving very manfully to be resigned to my fate , and for a few days I would cheerfully endeavour to make the best of it .
Parsing [sent. 3388 len. 38]: But the increasing desire I felt to get to England , that I might seek out my grandfather , and put him in possession of his diamonds , always prevented this state of things enduring very long .
Parsing [sent. 3389 len. 65]: I had obtained from Mrs Reichardt an idea of the value of these stones , and of the importance of their restoration to my relative , and I had often thought of the satisfaction I should enjoy in presenting myself before him , as the restorer of such valuable property , which , no doubt , had long since been given up as lost .
Parsing [sent. 3390 len. 47]: But latterly , I thought less of these things ; the chance of leaving the island seemed so remote , and the prospect of ever seeing my grandfather so very distant , that I had ceased to take any interest in the contents of the belt .
Parsing [sent. 3391 len. 23]: The diamonds seemed to become as valueless as they were useless ; a handful of wheat would have been much more desirable .
Parsing [sent. 3392 len. 17]: It was now some time since I had seen the belt , or inquired about it .
Parsing [sent. 3393 len. 49]: Thus we lived without any incident occurring worth relating -- when one day the appearance of the atmosphere indicated a storm , and a very violent hurricane , attended with peals of thunder and lurid flashes of lightning , lasted during the whole of the day and evening .
Parsing [sent. 3394 len. 32]: The wind tore up the trees by the roots , blew down our outhouses , made terrible havoc in our garden , and threatened to tumble our hut over our heads .
Parsing [sent. 3395 len. 45]: We could not think of going to our beds whilst such a tempest was raging around us , so we sat up , listening to the creaking of the boards , and anticipating every moment that the whole fabric would be blown to pieces .
Parsing [sent. 3396 len. 55]: Fortunately , the bark with which I had covered the roof , in a great measure protected us from the rain , which came down in torrents ; but every part was not equally impervious , and our discomfort was increased by seeing the water drip through , and form pools on the floor .
Parsing [sent. 3397 len. 22]: The thunder still continued at intervals , and was sometimes so loud as to have a most startling effect upon us .
Parsing [sent. 3398 len. 22]: My companion knelt down and said her prayers with great fervour , and I joined in them with scarcely less devotion .
Parsing [sent. 3399 len. 20]: Indeed it was an awful night , and our position , though under shelter , was not without danger .
Parsing [sent. 3400 len. 52]: The incessant flashes of lightning seemed to play round our edifice , as if determined to set it in a blaze ; and the dreadful peals of thunder that followed , rolled over our heads , as if about to burst upon the creaking boards that shut us from its fury .
Parsing [sent. 3401 len. 24]: I fancied once or twice that I heard during the storm bursts of sound quite different in character from the peals of thunder .
Parsing [sent. 3402 len. 29]: They were not so loud , and did not reverberate so much ; they seemed to come nearer , and then the difference in sound became very perceptible .
Parsing [sent. 3403 len. 5]: `` Great God ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3404 len. 21]: exclaimed Mrs Reichardt , starting up from her kneeling posture , `` that is a gun from some ship . ''
Parsing [sent. 3405 len. 15]: The wind seemed less boisterous for a few seconds , and the thunder ceased .
Parsing [sent. 3406 len. 18]: We listened breathlessly for the loud boom we had just heard , but it was not repeated .
Parsing [sent. 3407 len. 27]: In a moment afterwards our ears were startled by the most terrifying combination of screams , shrieks , cries , and wailings I had ever heard .
Parsing [sent. 3408 len. 8]: My blood seemed chilled in my veins .
Parsing [sent. 3409 len. 17]: `` A ship has just struck , '' whispered my companion , scarcely above her breath .
Parsing [sent. 3410 len. 10]: `` The Lord have mercy on the crew ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3411 len. 24]: She sank on her knees again in prayer , as if for the poor souls who were struggling in the jaws of death .
Parsing [sent. 3412 len. 39]: The wind still howled , and the thunder still roared , but in the fiercest war of the elements , I fancied I could every now and then hear the piercing shrieks sent up to heaven for assistance .
Parsing [sent. 3413 len. 85]: I thought once or twice of venturing out , but I remembered the safety of my companion was so completely bound up with my own , that I could not reconcile myself to leaving her ; and I was also well aware , that till the terrible fury of the tempest abated , it was impossible for me to be of the slightest service to the people of the wrecked ship , even could I remain unharmed exposed to the violence of the weather .
Parsing [sent. 3414 len. 30]: I however awaited with much impatience and intense anxiety till the storm had in some measure spent itself ; but this did not occur till sunrise the next morning .
Parsing [sent. 3415 len. 37]: The wind fell , the thunder and lightning ceased , the rain was evidently diminishing , and the brightness of the coming day began to burst through the darkest night that had ever visited the island .
Parsing [sent. 3416 len. 43]: Mrs Reichardt would not be left behind ; it was possible she might be useful , and taking with her a small basket of such things as she imagined might be required , she accompanied me to the rocks nearest the sea .
Parsing [sent. 3417 len. 11]: On arriving there , the most extraordinary scene presented itself .
Parsing [sent. 3418 len. 51]: The sea was strewed with spars , masts , chests , boats stove in or otherwise injured , casks , empty hen-coops , and innumerable pieces of floating wreck that were continually dashed against the rocks , or were washed ashore , wherever an opening for the sea presented itself .
Parsing [sent. 3419 len. 52]: At a little distance lay the remains of a fine ship , her masts gone by the board , her decks open , in fact a complete wreck , over which the sea had but lately been making a clean sweep , carrying overboard everything that could not resist its fury .
Parsing [sent. 3420 len. 32]: I could see nothing resembling a human being , though both myself and my companion looked carefully round in the hope of discovering some poor creature , that might need assistance .
Parsing [sent. 3421 len. 39]: It appeared , however , as if the people of the ship had taken to their boats , which had been swamped , and most probably all who had ventured into them had been devoured by the sharks .
Parsing [sent. 3422 len. 27]: Had the crew remained on board , they would in all probability have been saved ; as the vessel had been thrown almost high and dry .
Parsing [sent. 3423 len. 44]: As soon as we had satisfied ourselves that no sharks were in the neighbourhood , I launched my little boat , and each taking an oar , we pulled in the direction of the wreck , which we reached in a few minutes .
Parsing [sent. 3424 len. 17]: She had heeled over after striking , and the water was quite smooth under her lee .
Parsing [sent. 3425 len. 24]: I contrived to climb into the main chains , and from thence on board , and was soon afterwards diligently exploring the ship .
Parsing [sent. 3426 len. 22]: I penetrated every place into which I could effect an entrance , marvelling much at the variety of things I beheld .
Parsing [sent. 3427 len. 27]: There seemed such an abundance of everything , and of things too quite new to me , that I was bewildered by their novelty and variety .
Parsing [sent. 3428 len. 25]: Having discovered a coil of new rope , I hauled it on deck , and soon made fast my little boat to the ship .
Parsing [sent. 3429 len. 26]: Then I made a hasty rope ladder which I threw over , and Mrs Reichardt was in a very few minutes standing by my side .
Parsing [sent. 3430 len. 30]: Her knowledge was necessary to inform me of the uses of the several strange things I saw , and to select for our own use what was most desirable .
Parsing [sent. 3431 len. 36]: She being well acquainted with the interior of a ship , and having explained to me its numerous conveniences , I could not but admire the ingenuity of man , in creating such stupendous machines .
Parsing [sent. 3432 len. 18]: The ship having much water in the hold , I was forced to dive into the armoury .
Parsing [sent. 3433 len. 74]: It was the first time I had seen such things , and I handled the muskets and pistols with a vast deal of curiosity ; as my companion explained to me how they were loaded and fired , I at once saw their advantage over the bow and arrow , and was selecting two or three to carry away , when I hesitated on being assured they would be perfectly useless without ammunition .
Parsing [sent. 3434 len. 53]: I might have remained content with my own savage weapons that had already served me so well , had not Mrs Reichardt , in the course of our survey , discovered several tin canisters of powder perfectly uninjured , with abundance of shot and bullets , of which I quickly took possession .
Parsing [sent. 3435 len. 55]: From other parts of the vessel we selected bags of grain , barrels of flour , and provisions of various kinds ; wearing apparel , boxes of tools , with numerous bottles and jars , with the contents of which I was perfectly unacquainted , though their discovery gave great gratification to my companion .
Parsing [sent. 3436 len. 57]: What most excited my wonder , were various kinds of agricultural implements that we found in the hold , and in a short time I was made aware of the proper employment of spades , harrows , ploughs , thrashing-machines , and many other things , of the existence of which I had never before dreamt .
Parsing [sent. 3437 len. 76]: We found also quantities of various kinds of seeds and roots , and some sort of twigs growing in pots , which Mrs Reichardt particularly begged me not to leave behind , as they would be of the greatest use to us ; and she added that , from various signs , she believed that the ship had been an emigrant vessel going out with settlers , but to what place she could not say .
Parsing [sent. 3438 len. 57]: We made no ceremony in breaking open lockers and chests , and every where discovered a variety of things , which , could we transfer to our island , would add greatly to our comfort ; but how they were to be got ashore , was a puzzle which neither of us seemed capable of solving .
Parsing [sent. 3439 len. 30]: Our little boat would only contain a few of the lighter articles ; and as many of these as we could conveniently put together were shortly stowed in her .
Parsing [sent. 3440 len. 57]: With this cargo we were about returning , when my companion called my attention to a noise that seemed to come from a distant corner of the vessel , and she laughed and exhibited so much satisfaction that I believed we were close upon some discovery far more important than any we had yet hit upon .
Parsing [sent. 3441 len. 35]: We continued to make our way to what seemed to me a very out of the way part of the vessel , led in a great measure by the noises that proceeded from thence .
Parsing [sent. 3442 len. 53]: It was so dark here , that we were obliged to get a light , and my companion having procured a ship 's lantern , and lighted it by means of a tinderbox , led me to a place where I could discern several animals , most of which were evidently dead .
Parsing [sent. 3443 len. 30]: She however ascertained that there were two young calves , three or four sheep , and as many young pigs , still giving very noisy evidence of their existence .
Parsing [sent. 3444 len. 17]: She searched about and found some food for them , which they ate with great avidity .
Parsing [sent. 3445 len. 24]: The larger animals she told me were cows and horses ; but they had fallen down , and gave no signs of life .
Parsing [sent. 3446 len. 51]: My companion and myself then entered into a long debate as to how we were to remove the living animals from the dead ; and she dwelt very eloquently upon the great advantages that would accrue to us , if we could succeed in transporting to the island the survivors .
Parsing [sent. 3447 len. 30]: After giving them a good feed , seeing we could not remove them at present , we descended safely to our boat and gained the shore without any accident .
Parsing [sent. 3448 len. 64]: Then having housed our treasures , we were for putting together a raft of the various planks and barrels that were knocking against the rocks , but as I knew this would take a good deal of time , I thought I would inspect the ship 's boats , which , bottom upwards , were drifting about within a few yards of us .
Parsing [sent. 3449 len. 29]: To our great satisfaction , one I ascertained to be but little injured , and having forced her ashore , with our united exertions we turned her over .
Parsing [sent. 3450 len. 23]: In an hour we had made her water-tight , had picked up her oars , and were pulling merrily for the wreck .
Parsing [sent. 3451 len. 47]: Chapter XLIII Had the cows or horses been alive , they must have been left behind , for we could not have removed them , but the smaller animals were with comparatively little difficulty got on deck , and they descended with me into the boat .
Parsing [sent. 3452 len. 53]: We added a few things that lay handy , and in a few minutes were laughingly driving our four-footed treasures on shore , to the extreme astonishment of the gannets , which seemed as though they would never cease to flap their wings , as their new associates were driven by them .
Parsing [sent. 3453 len. 95]: In the same way we removed the most portable of the agricultural implements , bed and bedding , cots , and hammocks , furniture , the framework of a house , preserved provisions of all kinds , a medicine chest , boxes of books , crates of china and glass , all sorts of useful tools , and domestic utensils ; in short , in the course of the next two or three weeks , by repeated journeys , we filled every available place we could find with what we had managed to rescue .
Parsing [sent. 3454 len. 25]: Then came another terrible storm that lasted two days , after which the wreck having been broken up , was scattered in every direction .
Parsing [sent. 3455 len. 35]: I however managed to secure the drift wood , tubs , spars , and chests , which were all got on shore , and proved of the greatest service to me some time afterwards .
Parsing [sent. 3456 len. 37]: Numerous as our acquisitions had been in this way , both of us had been infinitely better pleased had we been able to rescue some of the ill-fated crew , to whom they had once belonged .
Parsing [sent. 3457 len. 43]: But not one of them could have escaped , and only one body was cast on shore , which was that of a young woman , who lay with her face to the ground , and her wet clothes clinging round her .
Parsing [sent. 3458 len. 20]: We turned her carefully over , and I beheld a face that seemed to me wonderfully fair and beautiful .
Parsing [sent. 3459 len. 59]: She had escaped the sharks , and had been dead several hours -- most probably she had been cast on shore by the waves soon after the ship struck , for she had escaped also the rocks , which , had she been dashed against , would have left fearful signs of their contact on her delicate frame .
Parsing [sent. 3460 len. 11]: The sight of her corpse gave me many melancholy thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 3461 len. 18]: I thought of the delight she might have caused both of us , had she been saved .
Parsing [sent. 3462 len. 9]: What a pleasant companion she might have proved !
Parsing [sent. 3463 len. 48]: Indeed , as I looked on her pale cold features , I fancied that she might have reconciled me to ending my existence on the island -- ay , even to the abandonment of my favourite scheme of seeking my grandfather to give him back his diamonds .
Parsing [sent. 3464 len. 63]: We took her up with as much pity and affection as if she were our nearest and dearest relative , and carried her home and placed her on Mrs Reichardt 's bed ; and then I laid some planks together , in the shape of what Mrs Reichardt called a coffin -- and I dug her a deep grave in the guano .
Parsing [sent. 3465 len. 23]: And all the while I found myself crying as I had never cried before , and my heart seemed weary and faint .
Parsing [sent. 3466 len. 66]: In solemn silence we carried her to her grave , and read over her the funeral service out of the Prayer-book , kneeling and praying for this nameless creature , whom we had never seen alive , as though she had been our companion for many years ; both of us shedding tears for her hapless fate as if we had lost a beloved sister .
Parsing [sent. 3467 len. 37]: And when we had filled up her grave and departed , we went home , and passed the most miserable day we had ever had to endure since we had first been cast upon the island .
Parsing [sent. 3468 len. 11]: I had now numerous occupations that kept me actively employed .
Parsing [sent. 3469 len. 57]: Still I could not for a long time help recalling to mind that pale face that looked so piteously upon me when I first beheld it ; and then I would leave off my work , and give myself up to my melancholy thoughts till my attention was called off by some appeal from my companion .
Parsing [sent. 3470 len. 41]: I made a kind of monument over the place where she was buried , and planted there the finest flowers we had ; and I never passed the spot without a prayer , as if I were approaching holy ground .
Parsing [sent. 3471 len. 29]: I must not forget to add , that a few days after the wreck we were agreeably surprised by visitors that , though unexpected , were extremely welcome .
Parsing [sent. 3472 len. 14]: I had noticed strange birds wandering about in various parts of the island .
Parsing [sent. 3473 len. 27]: On their coming under the notice of my companion , they were immediately recognised as fowls and ducks that had no doubt escaped from the ship .
Parsing [sent. 3474 len. 72]: We might now , therefore , constitute ourselves a little colony , of which Mrs Reichardt and myself were the immediate governors , the settlers being a mingled community of calves , sheep , pigs , and poultry , that lived on excellent terms with each other ; the quadrupeds having permission to roam where they pleased , and the bipeds being kept within a certain distance of the government house .
Parsing [sent. 3475 len. 37]: The old hut had suffered so much from the storm that I determined on building another in a better position , and had recourse to the framework of the house I had taken from the wreck .
Parsing [sent. 3476 len. 28]: I had some difficulty in putting the several parts together , but at last succeeded , and a small , but most commodious dwelling was the result .
Parsing [sent. 3477 len. 35]: Near it I laid out a new garden , wherein I planted all the orange-trees we had reared , as well as many of the seeds and roots we had brought from the wreck .
Parsing [sent. 3478 len. 26]: A little beyond I enclosed a paddock , wherein I planted the twigs we had found in pots , which proved to be fruit trees .
Parsing [sent. 3479 len. 40]: When I had done this , I thought of my agricultural implements , and very much desired to make use of a handy plough that was amongst them , when I learned the advantages that might arise from it .
Parsing [sent. 3480 len. 53]: At first , I yoked myself to the plough , and Mrs Reichardt held it : this proved such hard and awkward work that I kept projecting all sorts of plans for lessening the labour -- the best was that of yoking our calves , and making them pull instead of myself .
Parsing [sent. 3481 len. 9]: This was more easily thought of than done .
Parsing [sent. 3482 len. 40]: The animals did not prove very apt pupils , but in course of time , with a good deal of patience , and some manoeuvring , I succeeded in making them perform the work they were expected to do .
Parsing [sent. 3483 len. 36]: Thus , in building , gardening , planting , and farming , the time flew by quickly , and in the course of the next year the aspect of the place had become quite changed .
Parsing [sent. 3484 len. 20]: The guano that enriched the soil made every kind of vegetation thrive with an almost marvellous rapidity and luxuriance .
Parsing [sent. 3485 len. 23]: We had a comfortable house , up which a vine was creeping in one place , and a young pear-tree in another .
Parsing [sent. 3486 len. 15]: We were supplied with the choicest oranges , and had apples of several kinds .
Parsing [sent. 3487 len. 13]: We had abundance of furniture , and an inexhaustible stock of provisions .
Parsing [sent. 3488 len. 98]: We had a most gorgeous show of flowers of many different species ; our new kitchen garden was full of useful vegetables -- young fruit trees were yielding their produce wherever they had been planted -- the poultry had more than doubled their number -- the calves were taking upon themselves the full dignity of the state of cow and bull -- the ewes had numerous lambs -- and the pigs had not only grown into excellent pork , but had already produced more than one litter that would be found equally desirable when provisions ran scarce .
Parsing [sent. 3489 len. 19]: We had two growing crops , of different kinds of grain , and a large pasture-field fenced round .
Parsing [sent. 3490 len. 63]: The Little Savage , at seventeen , had been transformed into a farmer , and the cultivation of the farm and the care of the live stock soon left him no time for indulging in vain longings to leave the island , or useless regrets for the fair creature who , even in death , I had regarded as its greatest ornament .
Parsing [sent. 3491 len. 15]: Two years later , still greater improvements , and still greater additions became visible .
Parsing [sent. 3492 len. 58]: We were establishing a dairy farm on a small scale , and as our herds and flocks , as well as the pigs and poultry , increased rapidly , we promised in a few years to be the most thriving farmers that had ever lived in that part of the world by the cultivation of the land .
Parsing [sent. 3493 len. 35]: Chapter XLIV Although my first experimental voyage had proved so hazardous , now that I was better provided for meeting its perils , I became anxious to make another attempt to circumnavigate the island .
Parsing [sent. 3494 len. 41]: The boat that had belonged to the wrecked ship , from the frequent trips I had made in her to and from the shore , I could manage as well as if I had been rowing boats all my life .
Parsing [sent. 3495 len. 61]: With the assistance of Mrs Reichardt , who pulled an oar almost as well as myself , we could get her along in very good style , even when heavily laden , and our labours together had taken from her all that timidity which had deterred her from trusting herself with me , when I first ventured from the island .
Parsing [sent. 3496 len. 16]: I was , however , very differently circumstanced now , to what I was then .
Parsing [sent. 3497 len. 62]: Instead of a frail cockle-shell , that threatened to be capsized by every billow that approached it , and that would scarcely hold two persons comfortably , I was master of a well-built ship 's - boat , that would hold half a dozen with ease , and except in very rough weather , was as safe as any place ashore .
Parsing [sent. 3498 len. 46]: I had repaired the slight damage its timbers had received , and had made an awning to protect us when rowing from the heat of the sun ; I had also raised a sail , which would relieve us of a good deal of labour .
Parsing [sent. 3499 len. 31]: When everything was prepared , I urged Mrs Reichardt to accompany me in a voyage round the island ; an excursion I hoped would turn out equally pleasant and profitable .
Parsing [sent. 3500 len. 16]: I found her very averse to trusting herself farther from shore than was absolutely necessary .
Parsing [sent. 3501 len. 65]: She raised all kinds of objections -- prominent among which were my want of seamanship for managing a boat in the open sea ; the danger that might arise from a sudden squall coming on ; her fear of our getting amongst a shoal of sharks , and the risk we ran of driving against a projecting rock ; but I overruled them all .
Parsing [sent. 3502 len. 66]: I showed her , by taking little trips out to sea , that I could manage the boat either with the sail or the oars , and assured her that by keeping close to the island , we could run ashore before danger could reach us ; and that nothing could be easier than our keeping out of the reach of both rocks and sharks .
Parsing [sent. 3503 len. 58]: I do not think I quite convinced her that her fears were groundless , but my repeated entreaties , the fineness of the weather , and her dislike to be again left on the island , whilst I was risking my life at sea , prevailed , and she promised to join me in this second experiment .
Parsing [sent. 3504 len. 43]: Her forethought , however , was here as fully demonstrated as on other occasions , for she did not suffer the boat to leave the shore till she had provided for any accident that might prevent our return in the anticipated time .
Parsing [sent. 3505 len. 13]: A finer day for such a voyage we could not have selected .
Parsing [sent. 3506 len. 27]: The sky was without a cloud , and there was just wind enough for the purpose I wanted , without any apprehensions of this being increased .
Parsing [sent. 3507 len. 48]: I got up the awning , and spread the sail , and handing Mrs Reichardt to her appointed seat , we bid farewell to our four-footed and two-footed friends ashore , that were gazing at us as if they knew they were parting from their only protectors .
Parsing [sent. 3508 len. 22]: I then pushed the boat off , the wind caught the sail , and she glided rapidly through the deep water .
Parsing [sent. 3509 len. 49]: I let her proceed in this way about a quarter of a mile from the island , and then tacked ; the boat , obedient to the position of the sail , altered her course , and we proceeded at about the same rate for a considerable distance .
Parsing [sent. 3510 len. 20]: Mrs Reichardt , notwithstanding her previous fears , could not help feeling the exhilarating effect of this adventurous voyage .
Parsing [sent. 3511 len. 43]: We were floating , safely and gracefully , upon the billows , with nothing but sea and sky in every direction but one , where the rugged shores of our island home gave a bold , yet menacing feature to the view .
Parsing [sent. 3512 len. 12]: My heart seemed to expand with the majestic prospect before me .
Parsing [sent. 3513 len. 46]: Never had mariner , when discovering some prodigious continent , felt a greater degree of exultation than I experienced , when directing my little vessel over the immense wilderness of waters that spread out before me , till it joined the line of the horizon .
Parsing [sent. 3514 len. 46]: I sat down by the side of Mrs Reichardt , and allowed the boat to proceed on its course , either as if it required no directing hand , or that its present direction was so agreeable , I felt no inclination to alter it .
Parsing [sent. 3515 len. 32]: `` I can easily imagine , '' said I , `` the enthusiasm of such men as Columbus , whose discovery of America you were relating to me the other day .
Parsing [sent. 3516 len. 61]: The vocation of these early navigators was a glorious one , and , when they had tracked their way over so many thousand miles of pathless water , and found themselves in strange seas , expecting the appearance of land , hitherto unknown to the civilised world , they must have felt the importance of their mission as discoverers . ''
Parsing [sent. 3517 len. 10]: `` No doubt , Frank , '' she replied .
Parsing [sent. 3518 len. 44]: `` And probably it was this that supported the great man you have just named , in the severe trials he was obliged to endure , on the very eve of the discovery that was to render his name famous to all generations .
Parsing [sent. 3519 len. 44]: He had endured intolerable hardships , the ship had been so long without sight of land , that no one thought it worth while to look out for it , and he expected that his crew would mutiny , and insist on returning .
Parsing [sent. 3520 len. 65]: At this critical period of his existence , first one indication of land , and then another made itself manifest ; the curiosity of the disheartened sailors became excited ; hope revived in the breast of their immortal captain ; a man was now induced to ascend the main-top , and his joyful cry of land woke up the slumbering spirit of the crew .
Parsing [sent. 3521 len. 21]: In this way , a new world was first presented to the attention of the inhabitants of the old . ''
Parsing [sent. 3522 len. 46]: `` It appears to me very unjust , '' I observed , `` that so important a discovery should have become known to us , not by the name of its original discoverer , but by that of a subsequent visitor to its shores . ''
Parsing [sent. 3523 len. 27]: `` Undoubtedly , '' said Mrs Reichardt , `` it is apparently unfair that Americus Vespucius should obtain an honour which Christopher Columbus alone had deserved .
Parsing [sent. 3524 len. 26]: But of the fame which is the natural right of him whose courage and enterprise procured this unrivalled acquisition , no one can deprive him .
Parsing [sent. 3525 len. 30]: His gigantic discovery may always be known as America , but the world acknowledges its obligation to Columbus , and knows little beyond the name of his rival . ''
Parsing [sent. 3526 len. 29]: `` Were the immediate results of so large an addition to geographical knowledge , as beneficial to the entire human race as they ought to have been ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3527 len. 8]: `` I do not think they were .
Parsing [sent. 3528 len. 25]: The vast continent then thrown open to the advance of civilisation , may be divided into two portions , the south and the north .
Parsing [sent. 3529 len. 101]: The former was inhabited by a harmless effeminate race , who enjoyed many of the refinements of civilisation ; their knowledge of the arts , for instance , as shewn to us in the ruins of their cities , was considerable ; they possessed extensive buildings in a bold and ornate style of architecture ; they made a lavish use of the precious metals , of which the land was extremely rich , and they wore dresses which shewed a certain perfection in the manufacture of textile fabrics , and no slight degree of taste and art in their formation .
Parsing [sent. 3530 len. 113]: `` The Spaniards , who were led to this part of the continent by a desire to enrich themselves with the gold which the earliest discoverers had found in the new country in considerable quantities , invaded the territories of this peaceful people , and , by their superior knowledge of warlike weapons , and the ignorance of the intentions of their invaders that prevailed amongst the natives of all ranks , by a series of massacres , they were enabled , though comparatively but a small force , to obtain possession of the vast empire that had been established there from time immemorial , and turn it into a Spanish colony .
Parsing [sent. 3531 len. 56]: `` The blood of this harmless race flowed like water ; their great Incas or Emperors were deposed and murdered , their splendid temples plundered of their riches , their nobles and priests tortured to make them change their faith , and the great mass of the people became slaves to their more warlike conquerors .
Parsing [sent. 3532 len. 60]: It was in this way the gold of Mexico and Peru enriched the treasury of Spain ; but every ingot had the curse of blood upon it , and from that time the Spanish power , then at its height , began to decline in Europe , till it sunk in the scale of nations among the least important .
Parsing [sent. 3533 len. 86]: The colonies revolted from the mother country , and became independent states ; but the curse that followed the infamous appropriation of the country , seems to cling to the descendants of the first criminals , and neither government nor people prospers ; and it is evident that all these independent states must in time be absorbed by a great republic , that has sprung up by peaceable means , as it were at their side , whilst they were content to be colonies . ''
Parsing [sent. 3534 len. 9]: `` To what republic do you allude ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3535 len. 20]: `` You may remember that I told you that the entire continent was divided into south and north . ''
Parsing [sent. 3536 len. 4]: `` Exactly . ''
Parsing [sent. 3537 len. 28]: `` The history of the southern portion I have rapidly sketched for you , that of the northern you will find of a totally different character . ''
Parsing [sent. 3538 len. 8]: `` Pray let me hear it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3539 len. 25]: `` When North America was first discovered , it was found to be inhabited by a race of savages , divided into several tribes .
Parsing [sent. 3540 len. 56]: They had no manufactures ; they had no knowledge of art or science ; they lived in the impenetrable woods in huts , having no pretension to architecture ; they went almost entirely naked , were extremely warlike , and fond of hunting , and were known to devour the enemies they killed in battle .
Parsing [sent. 3541 len. 29]: `` To this barbarous race came a few adventurous men across the stormy Atlantic , from the distant island of England -- '' `` Ah , England ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3542 len. 32]: I exclaimed , `` that is the country of my parents -- that is the home of my grandfather ; let me hear anything you have to say about England . ''
Parsing [sent. 3543 len. 19]: Mrs Reichardt smiled at my animation , but proceeded without making any comment upon what I had said .
Parsing [sent. 3544 len. 39]: `` England possessed at this period many adventurous spirits , who were ready to dare every danger to obtain for their country a share in the honours which other lands had assumed through the enterprise of their navigators .
Parsing [sent. 3545 len. 129]: By such men different portions of the northern continent of America were discovered ; the fame of these new lands , their wonderful productiveness and admirable climate , soon spread amongst their countrymen , and from time to time various ships left the English ports with small bands of adventurers , who made what were termed settlements in the country of these savages -- not by mercilessly massacring them as the Spaniards had done in the south , and then plundering them of all they possessed , but by purchasing certain districts or pieces of land from the original occupants , which they peacefully cultivated ; as their numbers increased , they multiplied their habitations , and obtained by barter of the savages fresh accessions of territory . ''
Parsing [sent. 3546 len. 18]: `` The English showed themselves a much more humane people than the Spaniards , '' I observed .
Parsing [sent. 3547 len. 17]: `` But did they never come into collision with the wild natives of the country ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3548 len. 17]: `` Frequently , '' Mrs Reichardt replied , `` but in some measure this was unavoidable .
Parsing [sent. 3549 len. 49]: As new settlers from England landed in the country , they required more land ; but the savages were now not inclined to barter ; they had become jealous of the strangers , and were desirous of driving them back to their ships before they became too numerous .
Parsing [sent. 3550 len. 72]: Acts of hostility were committed by the savages upon the settlers , which were often marked by great brutality : this exasperated the latter , who joined in a warlike association , and notwithstanding their numbers and daring , drove them further and further from their neighbourhood , till either by conquest , treaties , or purchase , the Englishmen or their descendants obtained the greater portion of North America . ''
Parsing [sent. 3551 len. 10]: `` Do they still hold possession of it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3552 len. 3]: I asked .
Parsing [sent. 3553 len. 57]: `` Up to a recent date , the whole of this vast acquisition was a colony in obedience to the government of England ; but a dispute having arisen between the mother country and the colony , a struggle took place , which ended in the latter throwing off all subjection to the laws of England .
Parsing [sent. 3554 len. 32]: The extensive provinces joined together in a union of equal privileges and powers , which has since gone by the name of the Government of the United States of North America .
Parsing [sent. 3555 len. 49]: This is the great republic to which I just now alluded , that is gradually absorbing the minor Southern States into its -- union , and threatens at no very distant date to spread the English language and the English race over the whole continent of America . ''
Parsing [sent. 3556 len. 12]: `` Has England then completely lost the country she colonised ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3557 len. 12]: I inquired , feeling more and more interested in the subject .
Parsing [sent. 3558 len. 16]: `` No , a great portion still remains in her possession , '' she replied .
Parsing [sent. 3559 len. 39]: `` The people preserved their allegiance when their neighbours thought proper to rise in revolt , and are now in a state of great prosperity , governed by the laws of England , and supported by her power .
Parsing [sent. 3560 len. 11]: The English possessions in North America form an extensive district .
Parsing [sent. 3561 len. 21]: It is , however , but an inconsiderable fraction of the vast countries still remaining under the dominion of England .
Parsing [sent. 3562 len. 123]: Her territories lie in every quarter of the globe ; indeed the sun never sets upon this immense empire -- an empire with which the conquests of Alexander , and of Caesar , or the most formidable state that existed in ancient times , can not for a moment be compared ; and when we bear in mind that in all these various climates , and in all these far-distant shores , the flag of our country affords the same protection to the colonist as he would enjoy in his own land , we may entertain some idea of the vast power that government possesses which can make itself respected at so many opposite points from the source whence it emanates . ''
Parsing [sent. 3563 len. 27]: I was so much interested in this description , that I had neglected to notice the rate at which the boat was driving through the water .
Parsing [sent. 3564 len. 38]: I now rose with great alacrity to shift the sail , as we had got several miles from the island , and if I did not take care we might be blown out of sight of land .
Parsing [sent. 3565 len. 43]: I lost no time in putting her on another tack , but we had not proceeded far in this direction when I found the wind lull , and presently the sail drooped to the mast , and there was a dead calm .
Parsing [sent. 3566 len. 25]: It became necessary now to take to our oars , and we were presently pulling with all our strength in the direction of land .
Parsing [sent. 3567 len. 24]: This went on for some time till we were both tired , and I was surprised at the little progress we had made .
Parsing [sent. 3568 len. 61]: We lay on our oars and took some refreshment , and then pulled with additional vigour ; but I began to suspect that we were receding from the land instead of approaching it , and called Mrs Reichardt 's attention to the fact of the island diminishing in size notwithstanding the length of time we had been pulling towards it .
Parsing [sent. 3569 len. 34]: `` Ah , Frank , '' she said , in a melancholy tone of voice , `` I have for some time entertained suspicions that all our strength was being expended in vain .
Parsing [sent. 3570 len. 53]: It is very clear that we have got into a current that is every moment taking us farther out to sea , and if a breeze does not soon spring up , we shall lose sight of the island , and then , heaven only knows what will become of us . ''
Parsing [sent. 3571 len. 30]: I shook out the sail , in hopes of its catching sufficient wind to lead us out of the current , but not a breath of air was stirring .
Parsing [sent. 3572 len. 52]: We did not possess such a thing as a compass ; our provisions were only calculated for a pleasure trip -- we had only one small jar of water , and a flask of spirit , a few biscuits , two large cakes , a chicken , and some dried fish .
Parsing [sent. 3573 len. 29]: The land was rapidly receding ; I could only mark its position with respect to the sun that now was pouring its burning rays upon our little bark .
Parsing [sent. 3574 len. 21]: If it had not been for the awning we could not have endured it ; the heat was so oppressive .
Parsing [sent. 3575 len. 25]: We had been obliged to give over rowing , as much from the fatigue it occasioned , as from the hopelessness of our labour .
Parsing [sent. 3576 len. 12]: We now sat with sinking hearts watching the fast retreating land .
Parsing [sent. 3577 len. 54]: It had become a point -- it diminished to a speck , and as it disappeared from our anxious sight , the sun set in all his glory , and we were drifting at the mercy of the current we knew not where , with nothing but sky and sea all around us .
Parsing [sent. 3578 len. 55]: Chapter XLV Vainly I stretched my eyes around the illimitable field of ocean , in hope of discerning some indication of that power whose ships I had been told traversed every sea ; but nothing like a vessel was in sight -- the mighty waters stretched out like an endless desert on every side .
Parsing [sent. 3579 len. 44]: There was no sign of man in all this vast space , except our little boat ; and in comparison with this space , how insignificant were the two helpless human beings who sat silent and motionless in that boat awaiting their destiny .
Parsing [sent. 3580 len. 8]: The stars came out with marvellous brilliancy .
Parsing [sent. 3581 len. 26]: I fancied that I had never seen them appear so bright ; but probably the gloominess of my thoughts made them look brighter by contrast .
Parsing [sent. 3582 len. 36]: I seemed the centre of a glorious system of worlds revolving above me with a calm and tranquil beauty , that appeared to reproach me for giving way to despair in a scene so lovely .
Parsing [sent. 3583 len. 36]: The great mass of water , scarcely moved by a ripple , now appeared lit up with countless fires , and a purplish haze , like a low flame , was visible in every direction .
Parsing [sent. 3584 len. 12]: I directed the attention of my companion to this strange appearance .
Parsing [sent. 3585 len. 61]: Notwithstanding the intensity of her anxiety , she immediately entered into an explanation of the phenomenon , and attributed it to a peculiarly phosphoric state of the sea , caused by myriads of creatures which possess the quality of the glow-worm , and rising to the surface of the water , made the latter seem as though enveloped in flame .
Parsing [sent. 3586 len. 19]: I sat a long time watching the singular appearances that presented themselves whenever I dashed down the oar .
Parsing [sent. 3587 len. 31]: It looked as though I was beating fire instead of water , and flame seemed to come from the oar with the drops that fell from it into the sea .
Parsing [sent. 3588 len. 77]: In this way hours passed by : we were still floating with the current ; the moon and stars were now coldly shining over our heads ; the ocean around us was still gleaming with phosphoric fires , when Mrs Reichardt advised me to take some nourishment , and then endeavour to go to sleep , saying she would keep watch and apprise me if anything happened of which it might be advantageous to avail ourselves .
Parsing [sent. 3589 len. 29]: The only thing I desired was the appearance of a vessel , or the setting in of a breeze , of which at present not a sign existed .
Parsing [sent. 3590 len. 40]: I felt disinclined either to eat or to drink : but I proposed that my companion should make a meal and then go to sleep , as it was much more proper that I should keep watch than herself .
Parsing [sent. 3591 len. 100]: The fact was , we were both anxious that the other should be the first to diminish our little stock of food ; but as neither would be induced to do this , it was decided that our provisions should be divided into certain portions , which were only to be taken at sunrise and sunset , and that we should during the night relieve each other every three hours in keeping watch , that if we saw land , or a ship , or the wind should spring up , we might consult immediately as to our course .
Parsing [sent. 3592 len. 35]: I only succeeded in inducing her to lie down at the bottom of the boat , to obtain a little sleep , previously to her taking my place that I might so rest myself .
Parsing [sent. 3593 len. 47]: She first said her usual prayers for the evening , in which I joined , and in a few minutes I was glad to hear by her regular breathing , that she was obtaining that repose of which I was certain she stood greatly in need .
Parsing [sent. 3594 len. 36]: I was now the sole observer of the stupendous spectacle that spread out around and above me the most sublime feature in this imposing scene appeared to be the silence which reigned supreme over all .
Parsing [sent. 3595 len. 9]: The heavens were as mute as the sea .
Parsing [sent. 3596 len. 27]: It looked as if the earth had been engulfed by a second deluge , and all living nature had perished utterly from the face of it .
Parsing [sent. 3597 len. 35]: I felt a deep feeling of melancholy stealing over me : and could not forbear reproaching myself for embarking in this hazardous enterprise , and risking a life that I was bound to preserve .
Parsing [sent. 3598 len. 40]: What could become of us both I knew not -- but I was sensible that if we were not speedily picked up , or made some friendly shore , there existed but little hopes of our surviving many days .
Parsing [sent. 3599 len. 57]: I made up my mind that the island we should never see again , and though I had been so anxious for so many years to quit it , now that fate had separated us for ever , I could not console myself for the loss of a home endeared to me by so many recollections .
Parsing [sent. 3600 len. 13]: But my great grief was the loss of my grandfather 's diamonds .
Parsing [sent. 3601 len. 12]: He had now no chance of having them restored to him .
Parsing [sent. 3602 len. 41]: If they were found they would become the property of the discoverer ; and he would never know how his daughter perished on a rock , and how his grandson was swallowed up by the waters of the great deep .
Parsing [sent. 3603 len. 31]: And then I thought of that glorious England I had so long hoped to see , and my heart sunk within me as I gazed out upon the boundless prospect .
Parsing [sent. 3604 len. 17]: There was not a voice to murmur consolation , not a hand to offer me assistance .
Parsing [sent. 3605 len. 40]: Was I never to see those white cliffs which had been so often described to me , that I could call them to mind as clearly as if they stood in all their pride and beauty before my eyes ?
Parsing [sent. 3606 len. 64]: How often had I dreamed of approaching the hallowed shores of England -- how often had I heard the cheerful voices of her people welcoming the Little Savage to his natural home -- how often had I been embraced by my aged grandfather , and received into the happy circle of his friends , with the respect and affection due to his heir .
Parsing [sent. 3607 len. 25]: I had dreamed happy dreams , and seen blissful visions ; and the result was starvation in an open boat on the illimitable ocean .
Parsing [sent. 3608 len. 12]: Mrs Reichardt still slept , and I would not wake her .
Parsing [sent. 3609 len. 49]: As long as she was insensible to the dangers of her position she must exist in comparative happiness ; to disturb her was to bring her back to a sense of danger and misery , and the recollection that my folly had brought her to this hopeless state .
Parsing [sent. 3610 len. 40]: I noticed that a small cloud was making its appearance in the horizon , and almost at the same instant I observed it , I felt a breeze that was just sufficient to flap the sail against the mast .
Parsing [sent. 3611 len. 17]: In a few minutes the cloud had greatly increased , and the wind filled the sail .
Parsing [sent. 3612 len. 47]: I fancied it blew in a direction contrary to the current ; and in the belief that it did so I soon got the boat round , and to my great joy she was presently scudding before the wind at a rate that was sensibly increasing .
Parsing [sent. 3613 len. 23]: But the cloud presently began to envelop the heavens , and a thick darkness spread itself like a veil in every direction .
Parsing [sent. 3614 len. 46]: The wind blew very fresh , and strained the mast to which the sail had been fixed ; and now I began to entertain a new fear : some sudden gust might take the sail and capsize us , or tear it from its fastenings .
Parsing [sent. 3615 len. 19]: I would gladly have taken in the sail , but I considered it as rather a hazardous experiment .
Parsing [sent. 3616 len. 41]: Mrs Reichardt lay in a position that prevented my getting at it without disturbing her , or running the risk of tipping the boat over , when it would be sure to fill immediately , and sink with us both .
Parsing [sent. 3617 len. 34]: Though we could both swim , I felt assured that if we were once in the water , there would remain very little chance of our protracting our lives beyond a few hours .
Parsing [sent. 3618 len. 38]: The boat , therefore , continued to run before the wind at a rapid rate , the slight mast creaking , and the sail stretching so tight , I expected every minute that we should be upset .
Parsing [sent. 3619 len. 21]: At this moment Mrs Reichardt awoke , and her quick eye immediately took in the full extent of her danger .
Parsing [sent. 3620 len. 22]: `` We shall be lost , '' she said hurriedly , `` if we do not take in that sail ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3621 len. 29]: I was fully aware of this , but she had seen more of a sailor 's perils than I had , and knew better how to meet them .
Parsing [sent. 3622 len. 64]: She offered to assist me in taking in the sail , and directing me to be very careful , we proceeded , with the assistance of the awning , to the mast , and after a good deal of labour , and at some risk of being blown into the sea , we succeeded in furling the sail , and unshipping the mast .
Parsing [sent. 3623 len. 53]: We were now in quite as much danger from another cause -- the surface of the sea , which had been so smooth during the calm , was now so violently agitated by the wind , that the boat kept ascending one great billow only to descend into the trough of another .
Parsing [sent. 3624 len. 91]: We often went down almost perpendicularly , and the height seemed every moment increasing ; and every time we went thus plunging headlong into the boiling waters , I thought we should be engulfed never to rise ; nevertheless , the next minute , up we ascended on the crest of some more fearful wave than any we had hitherto encountered , and down again we plunged in the dark unfathomable abyss that , walled in by foaming mountains of water , appeared yawning to close over us for ever .
Parsing [sent. 3625 len. 41]: It was almost entirely dark ; we could see only the white foam of the wave over which we were about to pass ; save this , it was black below and black above , and impenetrable darkness all around .
Parsing [sent. 3626 len. 27]: Mrs Reichardt sat close to me with her hand in mine -- she uttered no exclamations of feminine terror -- she was more awe-struck than frightened .
Parsing [sent. 3627 len. 31]: I believe that she was fully satisfied her last hour had come , for I could hear her murmuring a prayer in which she commended her soul to her Creator .
Parsing [sent. 3628 len. 34]: I can not say that I was in any great degree alarmed -- the rapid up and down motion of the boat gave me a sensation of pleasure I had never before experienced .
Parsing [sent. 3629 len. 61]: To say the truth , I should have greatly enjoyed being thus at the mercy of the winds and waves , in the midst of a black and stormy night on the trackless ocean , had it not been for my constant thoughts of my companion , and my bitter self-reproaches for having led her into so terrible a danger .
Parsing [sent. 3630 len. 18]: I was now , however , called from these reflections , by the necessity of active employment .
Parsing [sent. 3631 len. 36]: The boat I found shipped water at every plunge , and if speedy means were not taken to keep the water under , there was little doubt that she would soon fill and go down .
Parsing [sent. 3632 len. 31]: I therefore seized the iron kettle we had brought with us to cook our dinner , and began rapidly bailing out the water , which was already over our ankles .
Parsing [sent. 3633 len. 41]: We continued to ship water , sometimes more and sometimes less ; and Mrs Reichardt , actuated no doubt by the same motives as myself , with a tin pan now assisted me in getting rid of the treacherous element .
Parsing [sent. 3634 len. 24]: By our united exertions we kept the water under , and hoped to be able to get rid of the whole of it .
Parsing [sent. 3635 len. 37]: About this time it began to rain very heavily , and although the awning protected our heads , so much fell into the boat , that notwithstanding our labours we continued to sit in a pool .
Parsing [sent. 3636 len. 35]: We were , however , glad to find that as the rain fell the wind abated , and as the latter subsided , the sea became less violent , and we shipped less water .
Parsing [sent. 3637 len. 58]: I was now able by my own exertions to keep the boat tolerably dry , and Mrs Reichardt , ever provident , spread out all the empty vessels she had brought with her to catch the rain , for as she said , we did not know how valuable that water might become in a short time .
Parsing [sent. 3638 len. 24]: The rain continued to pour down in a perfect torrent for several hours ; at the end of which the sky gradually cleared .
Parsing [sent. 3639 len. 48]: The sea , though still rough , presented none of those mountainous waves that a short time before had threatened to annihilate us at every descent , and there was just sufficient breeze to waft us along at a brisk rate with the assistance of our sail .
Parsing [sent. 3640 len. 27]: Mrs Reichardt helped me in putting up the mast , and directly we began to feel the breeze , she insisted on my taking some refreshment .
Parsing [sent. 3641 len. 17]: It was vitally necessary to both , for our labours had been heavy for several hours .
Parsing [sent. 3642 len. 24]: We therefore ate sparingly of our provisions , and washed down our meal with a pannikin of water mingled with a little spirit .
Parsing [sent. 3643 len. 12]: Chapter XLVI The morning dawned upon a boundless expanse of sea .
Parsing [sent. 3644 len. 80]: The first object that presented itself to my sight was an enormous whale spouting water about a quarter of a mile distant from me ; then I observed another , then a third , and subsequently , several more ; they presented a singular and picturesque appearance , as one or other of these vast animals was continually throwing up a column of water that caught the rays of the sun , and looked very beautiful in the distance .
Parsing [sent. 3645 len. 70]: I looked in vain for land ; I looked equally in vain for a ship ; there was nothing visible but this shoal of whales , and Mrs Reichardt endeavoured to cheer me by describing the importance of the whale fishery to England , and the perils which the men meet with who pursue the fish for the purpose of wounding them with an iron instrument called a harpoon .
Parsing [sent. 3646 len. 80]: I felt much interest in these details ; and my companion went into the whole history of a whaling expedition , describing the first discovery of the huge fish from the ship ; the pursuit in the boats , and the harpooning of the whale ; its struggles after having been wounded ; its being towed to the ship 's side ; the subsequent manufacture of oil from the blubber of the animal , and the preparation of whalebone .
Parsing [sent. 3647 len. 114]: In attending to this discourse , I completely forgot that I was being tossed about in the open sea , I knew not where ; and where I might be in a short time it would be proved I was equally ignorant : perhaps I should be a corpse floating on the surface of the ocean waiting for a tomb till a shark came that way ; perhaps I should be suffering the torments of hunger and thirst ; perhaps cast lifeless upon a rock , where my bleached bones would remain the only monument which would then declare that there once existed in these latitudes such a being as the Little Savage .
Parsing [sent. 3648 len. 25]: Where now could be the island I , though long so anxious to quit , now was a thousand times more desirous of beholding ?
Parsing [sent. 3649 len. 32]: I felt that nothing could be more agreeable to me than a glimpse of that wild rocky coast that had so often appeared to me the walls of an intolerable prison .
Parsing [sent. 3650 len. 28]: I strained my eyes in vain in every direction ; the line of the horizon stretched out uninterrupted by a single break of any kind all around .
Parsing [sent. 3651 len. 5]: Where could we be ?
Parsing [sent. 3652 len. 29]: I often asked myself ; but except that we were on the wide ocean , neither myself nor my companion had the slightest idea of our geographical position .
Parsing [sent. 3653 len. 24]: We must have been blown a considerable distance during the storm : much farther than the current had taken us from the island .
Parsing [sent. 3654 len. 61]: I calculated that we must have passed it by many a mile if we had continued the same course ; but the wind had shifted several times , and it might be that we were not so very long a sail from it , could we gain the slightest knowledge of the direction in which it was to be found .
Parsing [sent. 3655 len. 5]: But this was hopeless .
Parsing [sent. 3656 len. 14]: I felt assured that we must abandon all idea of seeing it again .
Parsing [sent. 3657 len. 32]: In the midst of these painful reflections , my companion directed my attention to an object at a very considerable distance , and intimated her impression that it was a ship .
Parsing [sent. 3658 len. 21]: Luckily , I had brought my glass with me , and soon was anxiously directing it to the required point .
Parsing [sent. 3659 len. 31]: It was a ship : but at so great a distance that it was impossible , as Mrs Reichardt said , for any person on board to distinguish our boat .
Parsing [sent. 3660 len. 54]: I would have sailed in that direction , but the wind was contrary : I had , therefore , no alternative but to wait till the ship should approach near enough to make us out ; and I passed several hours of the deepest anxiety in watching the course of the distant vessel .
Parsing [sent. 3661 len. 50]: She increased in size , so that I could observe that she was a large ship by the unassisted eye ; but as we were running before the wind in a totally different direction , there seemed very little chance of our communicating , unless she altered her course .
Parsing [sent. 3662 len. 35]: Mrs Reichardt mentioned that signals were made by vessels at a distance to attract each other 's attention , and described the various ways in which they communicated the wishes of their respective captains .
Parsing [sent. 3663 len. 36]: The only signal I had been in the habit of making was burning quantities of wood on the shore and pouring water on it to make it smoke -- this was impossible in our boat .
Parsing [sent. 3664 len. 22]: My companion at last suggested that I should tie a table-cloth to the mast ; its peculiar whiteness might attract attention .
Parsing [sent. 3665 len. 44]: The sail was presently taken in , and the table-cloth spread in its place ; but , unfortunately , it soon afterwards came on a dead calm -- the breeze died away , and the cloth hung in long folds against the mast .
Parsing [sent. 3666 len. 8]: No notice whatever was taken of us .
Parsing [sent. 3667 len. 43]: We now took to our oars and pulled in the direction of the ship ; but after several hours ' hard rowing , our strength had so suffered from our previous fatigues , that we seemed to have made very little distance .
Parsing [sent. 3668 len. 33]: In a short time the sun set , and we watched the object of all our hopes with most anxious eyes , till night set in and hid her from our sight .
Parsing [sent. 3669 len. 41]: Shortly afterwards a light breeze again sprung up ; with renewed hope we gave our sail to the wind , but it bore us in a contrary direction , and when morning dawned we saw no more of the ship .
Parsing [sent. 3670 len. 13]: The wind had now again shifted , and bore us briskly along .
Parsing [sent. 3671 len. 3]: But where ?
Parsing [sent. 3672 len. 26]: I had fallen asleep during the preceding night , wearied out with labour and anxiety , and I did not wake till long after daybreak .
Parsing [sent. 3673 len. 7]: Mrs Reichardt would not disturb me .
Parsing [sent. 3674 len. 14]: In sleep I was insensible to the miseries and dangers of my position .
Parsing [sent. 3675 len. 61]: She could not bring herself to disturb a repose that was at once so necessary to mind and body ; and I fell into a sweet dream of a new home in that dear England I had prayed so often to see ; and bright faces smiled upon me , and voices welcomed me , full of tenderness and affection .
Parsing [sent. 3676 len. 108]: I fancied that in one of those faces I recognised my mother , of whose love I had so early been deprived , and that it was paler than all the others , but infinitely more tender and affectionate : then the countenance seemed to grow paler and paler , till it took upon itself the likeness of the fair creature I had buried in the guano , and I thought she embraced me , and her arms were cold as stone , and she pressed her lips to mine , and they gave a chill to my blood that made me shake as with an ague .
Parsing [sent. 3677 len. 85]: Suddenly I beheld Jackson with his sightless orbs groping towards me with a knife in his hand , muttering imprecations , and he caught hold of me , and we had a desperate struggle , and he plunged a long knife into my chest , with a loud laugh of derision and malice ; and as I felt the blade enter my flesh , I gave a start and jumped up , and alarmed Mrs Reichardt by the wild cry with which I awoke .
Parsing [sent. 3678 len. 30]: How strongly was that dream impressed upon my mind ; and the features of the different persons who figured in it -- how distinctly they were brought before me !
Parsing [sent. 3679 len. 50]: My poor mother was as fresh in my recollection as though I had seen her but yesterday , and the sweetness of her looks as she approached me -- how I now tried to recall them , and feasted on their memory as though it were a lost blessing .
Parsing [sent. 3680 len. 54]: Then the nameless corpse that had been washed from the wreck , how strange it seemed , that after this lapse of time she should appear to me in a dream , as though we had been long attached to each other , and her affections had been through life entirely my own .
Parsing [sent. 3681 len. 3]: Poor girl !
Parsing [sent. 3682 len. 40]: Perhaps even now some devoted lover mourns her loss ; or hopes at no distant date to be able to join her in the new colony , to attain which a cruel destiny had forced her from his arms .
Parsing [sent. 3683 len. 12]: Little does he dream of her nameless grave under the guano .
Parsing [sent. 3684 len. 39]: Little does he dream that the only colony in which he is likely to join her is that settlement in the great desert of oblivion , over which Death has remained governor from the birth of the world .
Parsing [sent. 3685 len. 60]: But the most unpleasant part of the vision was the appearance of Jackson ; and it was a long time before I could bring myself to believe that I had not beheld his well known features -- that I had not been stabbed by him , and that I was not suffering from the mortal wound he had inflicted .
Parsing [sent. 3686 len. 26]: I however at last shook off the delusion , and to Mrs Reichardt 's anxious inquiries replied only that I had had a disagreeable dream .
Parsing [sent. 3687 len. 78]: In a short time I began to doubt whether the waking was more pleasant than the dreaming -- the vast ocean still spread itself before me like a mighty winding sheet , the fair sky , beautiful as it appeared in the rays of the morning sun , I could only regard as a pall -- and our little bark was the coffin in which two helpless human beings , though still existing , were waiting interment .
Parsing [sent. 3688 len. 7]: `` Has God abandoned us ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3689 len. 33]: I asked my companion , `` or has He forgotten that two of his creatures are in the deepest peril of their lives , from which He alone can save them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3690 len. 3]: `` Hush !
Parsing [sent. 3691 len. 14]: Frank Henniker , '' exclaimed Mrs Reichardt solemnly ; `` this is impious .
Parsing [sent. 3692 len. 11]: God never abandons those who are worthy of His protection .
Parsing [sent. 3693 len. 45]: He will either save them at His own appointed time -- or if He think it more desirable , will snatch them from a scene where so many dangers surround them , and place them where there prevails eternal tranquillity , and everlasting bliss .
Parsing [sent. 3694 len. 39]: `` We should rather rejoice , '' she added , with increasing seriousness , `` that we are thought worthy of being so early taken from a world in which we have met with so many troubles . ''
Parsing [sent. 3695 len. 40]: `` But to die in this way , '' I observed gloomily ; `` to be left to linger out days of terrible torture , without a hope of relief -- I can not reconcile myself to it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3696 len. 30]: `` We must die sooner or later , '' she said , `` and there are many diseases which are fatal after protracted suffering of the most agonising description .
Parsing [sent. 3697 len. 6]: These we have been spared .
Parsing [sent. 3698 len. 33]: The wretch who lingers in torment , visited by some loathsome disorder , would envy us , could he see the comparatively easy manner in which we are suffered to leave existence .
Parsing [sent. 3699 len. 17]: `` But I do not myself see the hopelessness of our case , '' she added .
Parsing [sent. 3700 len. 31]: `` It is not yet impossible that we may be picked up by a ship , or discover some friendly shore whence we might obtain a passage for England . ''
Parsing [sent. 3701 len. 45]: `` I see no prospect of this , '' said I ; `` we are apparently out of the track of ships , and if it should be our chance to discover one , the people on board are not likely to observe us .
Parsing [sent. 3702 len. 10]: I wish I had never left the island . ''
Parsing [sent. 3703 len. 19]: Mrs Reichardt never reproached me -- never so much as reminded me that it was my own fault .
Parsing [sent. 3704 len. 13]: She merely added , `` It was the will of God . ''
Parsing [sent. 3705 len. 26]: We ate and drank our small rations -- my companion always blessing the meal , and offering a thanksgiving for being permitted to enjoy it .
Parsing [sent. 3706 len. 6]: I noticed what was left .
Parsing [sent. 3707 len. 15]: We had been extremely economical , yet there was barely enough for another day .
Parsing [sent. 3708 len. 22]: We determined still further to reduce the trifling portion we allowed ourselves , that we might increase our chance of escape .
Parsing [sent. 3709 len. 43]: Chapter XLVII Five days and nights had we been drifting at the mercy of the winds and waves ; all our small stock of food had been devoured -- though we had hoarded every crumb , as the miser hoards his gold .
Parsing [sent. 3710 len. 24]: Even the rain water , as well as the water we had brought with us , we had drained to the last drop .
Parsing [sent. 3711 len. 47]: The weather continually alternated from a dead calm to a light breeze : the wind frequently shifted , but I had no strength left to attend to the sail -- the boat was abandoned to its own guidance , or rather to that of the wind .
Parsing [sent. 3712 len. 24]: When becalmed we lay still -- when the breeze sprang up we pursued our course till the sail no longer felt its influence .
Parsing [sent. 3713 len. 16]: Five long days and nights -- days of intolerable suffering , nights of inexpressible horror .
Parsing [sent. 3714 len. 26]: From sunrise to sunset I strained my eyes along the line of the horizon , but nothing but sky and wave ever met my gaze .
Parsing [sent. 3715 len. 22]: When it became dark , excited by the deep anxiety I had endured throughout the day , I could not sleep .
Parsing [sent. 3716 len. 34]: I fancied I beheld through the darkness monstrous forms mocking and gibbering , and high above them all was reared the head of the enormous python I had combated in the Happy Valley .
Parsing [sent. 3717 len. 35]: And he opened his tremendous jaws , as though to swallow me , and displayed fold upon fold of his immense form as if to involve and crush the boat in its mighty involutions .
Parsing [sent. 3718 len. 40]: I was always glad when the day dawned , or if the night happened to be fair and starlight ; for the spectres vanished when the sun shone , and the tranquil beauty of the stars calmed my soul .
Parsing [sent. 3719 len. 68]: I was famishing for want of food -- but I suffered most from want of water , for the heat during the day was tremendous , and I became so frantic from thirst , that nothing but the exhortations of Mrs Reichardt would have prevented me from dashing myself into the sea , and drinking my fill of the salt water that looked so tempting and refreshing .
Parsing [sent. 3720 len. 38]: My companion sought to encourage me to hope , long after all hope had vanished -- then she preached resignation to the Divine Will , and in her own nature gave a practical commentary on her text .
Parsing [sent. 3721 len. 21]: I perceived that her voice was getting more and more faint -- and that she was becoming hourly more feeble .
Parsing [sent. 3722 len. 28]: She was not able to move from her seat , and at last asked me to assist her to lie down at the bottom of the boat .
Parsing [sent. 3723 len. 24]: Then I noticed that she prayed fervently , and I could often distinguish my name in these petitions to the throne of Grace .
Parsing [sent. 3724 len. 40]: I felt a strange sensation in my head , and my tongue became in my mouth as a dry stick -- from this I was relieved by chewing the sleeve of my shirt ; but my head grew worse .
Parsing [sent. 3725 len. 10]: My eyes too were affected in a strange manner .
Parsing [sent. 3726 len. 28]: I continually fancied that I saw ships sailing about at a little distance from me , and I strove to attract their attention by calling to them .
Parsing [sent. 3727 len. 16]: My voice was weak and I could create only a kind of half stifled cry .
Parsing [sent. 3728 len. 57]: Then I thought I beheld land : fair forests and green pastures spread before me -- bright flowers and refreshing fruits grew all around -- and I called to my companion to make haste for we were running ashore and should presently be pulling the clustering grapes and should lay ourselves down among the odorous flowers .
Parsing [sent. 3729 len. 15]: Mrs Reichardt opened her eyes and gazed at me with a more painful interest .
Parsing [sent. 3730 len. 25]: She knew I was haunted by the chimeras created by famine and thirst ; but she seemed to have lost all power of speech .
Parsing [sent. 3731 len. 31]: She motioned me to join her in prayer ; I , however , was too much occupied with the prospect of landing , and paid no attention to her signs .
Parsing [sent. 3732 len. 59]: Presently the bright landscape faded away , and I beheld nothing but the wide expanse of water , the circle of which appeared to expand and spread into the sky , and the sky seemed lost and broken up in the water , and for a few minutes they were mixed together in the wildest and strangest confusion .
Parsing [sent. 3733 len. 34]: Subsequently to this I must have dropt asleep , for after a while I found myself huddled up in a corner of the boat , and must have fallen there from my seat .
Parsing [sent. 3734 len. 13]: I stared about me for some time , unconscious where I was .
Parsing [sent. 3735 len. 18]: The bright sun still shone over my head ; the everlasting sea still rolled beneath my feet .
Parsing [sent. 3736 len. 38]: I looked to the bottom of the boat , and met the upturned gaze of my fellow voyager -- the pale face had grown paler , and the expression of the painful eye had become less intelligent .
Parsing [sent. 3737 len. 33]: I thought she was as I had seen her in my dream , when she changed from her own likeness to that of the poor drowned girl we buried in the guano .
Parsing [sent. 3738 len. 15]: I turned away my gaze -- the sight was too painful to look upon .
Parsing [sent. 3739 len. 29]: I felt assured that she was dying , and that in a very short space of time , that faithful and affectionate nature I must part from forever .
Parsing [sent. 3740 len. 9]: I thought I would make a last effort .
Parsing [sent. 3741 len. 48]: Though faint and trembling , burning with fever , and feeling deadly sick , I managed by the support of the awning to crawl to the mast , and embracing it with one arm I raised the glass with the other hand , and looked carefully about .
Parsing [sent. 3742 len. 11]: My hand was very unsteady and my eyes seemed dim .
Parsing [sent. 3743 len. 7]: I could discern nothing but water .
Parsing [sent. 3744 len. 29]: I should have sunk in despair to the bottom of the boat , had I not been attracted at the moment by a singular appearance in the sky .
Parsing [sent. 3745 len. 15]: A cloud was approaching of a shape and appearance I had never observed before .
Parsing [sent. 3746 len. 38]: I raised the glass again , and after observing this cloud for some time with great attention , I felt assured that what I considered to be long lines of vapour was an immense flock of birds .
Parsing [sent. 3747 len. 22]: This discovery interested me -- I forgot the intensity of my sufferings in observing the motions of this apparently endless flock .
Parsing [sent. 3748 len. 21]: As the first file approached , I looked again , to see if I could make out what they were .
Parsing [sent. 3749 len. 4]: God of heaven !
Parsing [sent. 3750 len. 4]: They were gannets .
Parsing [sent. 3751 len. 25]: I crawled back to my companion as rapidly as my feeble limbs would allow , to inform her of the discovery I had made .
Parsing [sent. 3752 len. 2]: Alas !
Parsing [sent. 3753 len. 7]: I found that I was unheeded .
Parsing [sent. 3754 len. 34]: I could not believe that her fine spirit had fled ; no , she moved her hand ; but the dull spiritless gaze seemed to warn me that her dissolution was fast approaching .
Parsing [sent. 3755 len. 43]: I looked for the spirit flask , and found a few drops were still left there ; I poured these into her mouth , and watched the result with the deepest anxiety I had ever known since the day of my birth .
Parsing [sent. 3756 len. 30]: In a few minutes I found that she breathed more regularly and distinctly -- presently her eyes lost that fixedness which had made them so painful to look upon .
Parsing [sent. 3757 len. 25]: Then she recognised me , and took hold of my hand , regarding me with the sweet smile with which I was so familiar .
Parsing [sent. 3758 len. 70]: As soon as I found that consciousness had returned , I told her of the great flock of gannets that were evidently wending their way to their customary resting place , and the hope I entertained that if they could be kept in sight , and the wind remained in the same quarter , the boat might be led by them to the place where they laid their eggs .
Parsing [sent. 3759 len. 14]: She listened to me with attention , and evidently understood what I said .
Parsing [sent. 3760 len. 32]: Her lips moved , and I thought she was returning thanks to God -- accepting the flight of the birds as a manifest proof that He was still watching over us .
Parsing [sent. 3761 len. 15]: In a few minutes she seemed so much better that she could sit up .
Parsing [sent. 3762 len. 69]: I noticed her for some time watching the gannets that now approached in one vast cloud that threatened to shut us out from the sky -- she then turned her gaze in an opposite direction , and with a smile of exultation that lit up her wan face as with a glory , stretched her arm out , pointing her hand to a distant portion of the sea .
Parsing [sent. 3763 len. 29]: My gaze quickly followed hers , and I fancied I discovered a break in the line of the horizon ; but it did not look like a ship .
Parsing [sent. 3764 len. 21]: I pointed the glass in that direction , and felt the joyful assurance that we were within sight of land .
Parsing [sent. 3765 len. 26]: This additional discovery gave me increased strength : or rather hope now dawning upon us , gave me an impulse I had not felt before .
Parsing [sent. 3766 len. 8]: I in my turn became the consoler .
Parsing [sent. 3767 len. 25]: I encouraged Mrs Reichardt , with all the arguments of which I was master , to think that we should soon be in safety .
Parsing [sent. 3768 len. 14]: She smiled , and something like animation again appeared in her pale features .
Parsing [sent. 3769 len. 15]: If I could save her , I felt I should be blessed beyond measure .
Parsing [sent. 3770 len. 13]: Such an object was worth striving for ; and I did strive .
Parsing [sent. 3771 len. 69]: I know not how it was that I gained strength to do what I did on that day ; but I felt that I was supported from On High , and as the speck of land that she had first discovered gradually enlarged itself as we approached it , my exertions to secure a speedy rescue for my companion from the jaws of death , continued to increase .
Parsing [sent. 3772 len. 29]: The breeze remained fair and we scudded along at a spanking rate , the gannets keeping us company all the way -- evidently bound to the same shore .
Parsing [sent. 3773 len. 48]: I kept talking to Mrs Reichardt , and endeavouring to raise her spirits with the most cheering description of what we should do when we got ashore , for God would be sure to direct us to some place where we might without difficulty recover our strength .
Parsing [sent. 3774 len. 37]: Hitherto she had not spoken , but as soon as we began to distinguish the features of the shore we were approaching she unclosed her lips , and again the same triumphant smile played around them .
Parsing [sent. 3775 len. 11]: `` Frank Henniker , do you know that rock ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3776 len. 3]: `` No !
Parsing [sent. 3777 len. 3]: -- yes !
Parsing [sent. 3778 len. 6]: -- can it be possible ?
Parsing [sent. 3779 len. 12]: O what a gracious Providence has been watching over us ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3780 len. 17]: It was a rock of a remarkable shape that stood a short distance from the fishing-pool .
Parsing [sent. 3781 len. 16]: It could not be otherwise , the gannets had led us to their old haunts .
Parsing [sent. 3782 len. 6]: We were approaching our island .
Parsing [sent. 3783 len. 10]: I looked at my companion -- she was praying .
Parsing [sent. 3784 len. 57]: I immediately joined with her in thanks - giving for the signal mercy that had been vouchsafed to us , and in little more than an hour had the priceless satisfaction of carrying her from the shore to the cottage , and then we carefully nursed ourselves till we recovered the effects of this dreadful cruise .
Parsing [sent. 3785 len. 75]: Chapter XLVIII My numerous pursuits , as I stated in a preceding chapter obliging me to constant occupation , kept me from useless repining about my destiny , in being obliged to live so many years on this far-distant corner of the earth , I had long ceased to look for passing ships -- I scarcely ever thought about them , and had given up all speculations about my grandfather 's reception of me .
Parsing [sent. 3786 len. 29]: I rarely went out to sea , except to fish , and never cared to trouble myself about anything beyond the limited space which had become my inheritance .
Parsing [sent. 3787 len. 68]: The reader , then , may judge of my surprise when , one sultry day , I had been busily engaged for several hours cutting down a field of wheat , Mrs Reichardt came running to me with the astounding news that there was a ship off the island , and a boat full of people had just left her , and were rowing towards the rocks .
Parsing [sent. 3788 len. 44]: I hastily took the glass she had brought with her , and as soon as I could get to a convenient position , threw myself on the ground on the rock , and reconnoitred through the glass the appearance of the new comers .
Parsing [sent. 3789 len. 36]: I soon noticed that a part were well armed , which was not the case with the rest , for they were pinioned in such a manner that they could scarcely move hand or foot .
Parsing [sent. 3790 len. 11]: We concealed ourselves by lying our lengths on the grass .
Parsing [sent. 3791 len. 38]: As the boat approached , I could discern that the unarmed party belonged to a superior class of men , while many of the others had countenances that did not prepossess me at all in their favour .
Parsing [sent. 3792 len. 20]: We lay hid in the long grass , from which we could command a view of our approaching visitors .
Parsing [sent. 3793 len. 12]: `` I think I understand this , '' whispered Mrs Reichardt .
Parsing [sent. 3794 len. 7]: `` There is mischief here . ''
Parsing [sent. 3795 len. 12]: `` Had I not better run home and get arms ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3796 len. 3]: I asked .
Parsing [sent. 3797 len. 13]: `` No , '' she replied , `` you had better not .
Parsing [sent. 3798 len. 16]: If we are able to do any good , we must do it by stratagem .
Parsing [sent. 3799 len. 13]: Let us watch their movements , and act with great caution . ''
Parsing [sent. 3800 len. 33]: My companion 's advice was , I saw , the wisest that could be pursued ; and therefore we remained in our hiding places , narrowly observing our visitors as they approached .
Parsing [sent. 3801 len. 17]: They entered the fishing-pool , and I could then distinctly not only see but hear them .
Parsing [sent. 3802 len. 29]: To my extreme surprise , one of the first men who jumped out of the boat was John Gough , who had brought Mrs Reichardt to the island .
Parsing [sent. 3803 len. 18]: He looked older , but I recognised him in a moment , and so did my companion .
Parsing [sent. 3804 len. 6]: Her admonitory `` Hush ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3805 len. 32]: kept me from betraying the place of our concealment -- so great was my astonishment -- having long believed him and all his lawless associates to have been lost at sea .
Parsing [sent. 3806 len. 40]: He was well armed , and evidently possessed some authority ; nevertheless , I thought I could detect an air of concern in his features , as he offered to help one of the captives out of the boat .
Parsing [sent. 3807 len. 28]: The latter , however , regarded him with an air of disdain , and , though his hands were tied behind him , leaped ashore without assistance .
Parsing [sent. 3808 len. 23]: He was a man of commanding stature , with a well bronzed face , and a look of great energy of character .
Parsing [sent. 3809 len. 24]: He wore a band of gold lace round his cap , and had on duck trousers , and a blue jacket and waistcoat .
Parsing [sent. 3810 len. 6]: `` Come , captain ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3811 len. 11]: exclaimed John Gough , `` I bear you no malice .
Parsing [sent. 3812 len. 18]: Though you have been rather hard upon us , we wo n't leave you to starve . ''
Parsing [sent. 3813 len. 41]: `` He 's a deuced deal better off than he desarves to be , '' cried a man from the boat , whom I at once recognised as the fellow on whom I had drawn my knife for hurting Nero .
Parsing [sent. 3814 len. 61]: `` If we had made him walk the plank , as I proposed , I 'm blowed if it would n't have been much more to the purpose than putting him on this here island , with lots o ' prog , and everything calkilated to make him and his domineering officers comfortable for the rest of their days . ''
Parsing [sent. 3815 len. 15]: `` Hold your tongue , you mutineering rascal , '' exclaimed the captain angrily .
Parsing [sent. 3816 len. 16]: `` A rope 's end at the yard-arm will be your deserts before long . ''
Parsing [sent. 3817 len. 18]: `` Thank ye kindly , captain , '' replied the fellow , touching his hat in mockery .
Parsing [sent. 3818 len. 82]: `` But you must be pleased to remember I ai n't caught yet ; and we means to have many a jolly cruise in your ship , and get no end o ' treasure , before I shall think o ' my latter end ; and then I means to die like a Christian , and repent o ' my sins , and make a much more edifying example than I should exhibit dangling at the end of a rope . ''
Parsing [sent. 3819 len. 26]: The men laughed , the captain muttered something about `` pirates and mutineers , '' but the rest of the officers wisely held their tongues .
Parsing [sent. 3820 len. 19]: I now noticed an elderly man of very respectable appearance , who was not pinioned like the rest .
Parsing [sent. 3821 len. 23]: His hair was quite white , his complexion very pale , and he looked like one oppressed with deep sorrow and anxiety .
Parsing [sent. 3822 len. 17]: He rose from his seat in the boat , and was assisted out by John Gough .
Parsing [sent. 3823 len. 33]: `` I 'm very sorry that we are obliged to leave you here , Mr Evelyn , '' said Gough , `` but you see , sir , we have no alternative .
Parsing [sent. 3824 len. 31]: We could n't keep you with us , for many reasons ; and therefore we have been obliged to make you a sharer in the fate of our officers . ''
Parsing [sent. 3825 len. 24]: `` And werry painful this is to our feelings , sir , you may believe , '' said another of the mutineers mockingly .
Parsing [sent. 3826 len. 12]: `` I 'm quite moloncholy as I thinks on it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3827 len. 22]: The men again laughed ; but the person so addressed walked to the side of the captain without making any observation .
Parsing [sent. 3828 len. 10]: The other captives also left the boat in silence .
Parsing [sent. 3829 len. 23]: They were eight in all , but four of them were evidently common seamen by their dress -- the others were officers .
Parsing [sent. 3830 len. 7]: All were well-made , strong men .
Parsing [sent. 3831 len. 14]: `` What a precious pretty colony you 'll make , my hearties ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3832 len. 28]: exclaimed one of the mutineers , jeeringly , as he helped to land a cask , and some other packages , that they had brought with them .
Parsing [sent. 3833 len. 29]: `` It 's a thousand pities you ai n't got no female associates , that you might marry , and settle , and bring up respectable families . ''
Parsing [sent. 3834 len. 40]: `` Talking of women , '' cried the one who had first spoken , `` I wonder what became of the one we left here so cleverly when we was wrecked at this here place six years ago . ''
Parsing [sent. 3835 len. 18]: John Gough looked uneasy at this inquiry , as if the recollection was not agreeable to him .
Parsing [sent. 3836 len. 31]: `` And the Little Savage , '' continued the fellow , `` what was agoing to send his knife into my ribs for summat or other -- I forget what .
Parsing [sent. 3837 len. 25]: They must have died long ago , I ai n't no doubt , as we unfortnitely left 'em nothin ' to live upon . ''
Parsing [sent. 3838 len. 20]: `` No doubt they died hand in hand , like the Babes in the Wood , '' said another .
Parsing [sent. 3839 len. 17]: I still observed John Gough ; he seemed distressed at the turn the conversation had taken .
Parsing [sent. 3840 len. 18]: `` Now , mates , '' he said hurriedly , `` let us return to the ship .
Parsing [sent. 3841 len. 10]: We have done what we came to do . ''
Parsing [sent. 3842 len. 24]: `` I votes as we shall go and see arter the Missionary 's woman and the Little Savage , '' cried the fourth .
Parsing [sent. 3843 len. 30]: `` I should like , somehow , to see whether they be living or not , and a stroll ashore wo n't do any on us any harm . ''
Parsing [sent. 3844 len. 41]: `` I shall remain here till you return , '' said John Gough ; and he threw himself on the grass with his back towards me , and only a few yards from the place in which we were concealed .
Parsing [sent. 3845 len. 24]: The rest , after making fast the boat , started off on an exploring expedition , in the direction of the old hut .
Parsing [sent. 3846 len. 15]: Chapter XLIX The captives were grouped together , some sitting , and some standing .
Parsing [sent. 3847 len. 28]: Not one of them looked dejected at his fate ; though I could see by their movements that they were impatient of the bonds that tied them .
Parsing [sent. 3848 len. 18]: My attention was most frequently directed to the old gentleman who had been addressed as Mr Evelyn .
Parsing [sent. 3849 len. 27]: Notwithstanding the grief expressed in his countenance , it possessed an air of benevolence and kindness of heart that even his settled melancholy did not conceal .
Parsing [sent. 3850 len. 43]: I could not understand why , but I felt a deeper interest for this person than for any of the others -- a sort of yearning towards him , mingled with a desire to protect him from the malice of his enemies .
Parsing [sent. 3851 len. 21]: Almost as soon as they were gone , John Gough beckoned to Mr Evelyn to sit down by his side .
Parsing [sent. 3852 len. 46]: Possibly this was done to prevent his assisting his companions to regain their liberty , as he , not being pinioned like the rest , might easily have done , and they might have overpowered their guard before his companions could come to his assistance .
Parsing [sent. 3853 len. 33]: But Gough was well armed , and the rest being without weapons of any kind , it was scarcely probable that they would have risked their lives in so desperate an attempt .
Parsing [sent. 3854 len. 13]: Mr Evelyn came and quietly sat himself down in the place indicated .
Parsing [sent. 3855 len. 34]: I observed him with increasing interest , and singular to relate , the more I gazed on his venerable face , the more strongly I felt assured that I had seen it before .
Parsing [sent. 3856 len. 32]: This of course was impossible , nevertheless , the fancy took possession of me , and I experienced a strange sensation of pleasure as I watched the changes his features underwent .
Parsing [sent. 3857 len. 26]: `` John Gough , I am sorry to see you mixed up in this miserable business , '' said he , mildly addressing his companion .
Parsing [sent. 3858 len. 26]: The other did not answer , and as his back was turned towards me I could not observe the effect the observation had upon him .
Parsing [sent. 3859 len. 28]: `` The men who have left us I know to be bad men , '' continued the speaker ; `` I expect nothing but wickedness from them .
Parsing [sent. 3860 len. 11]: But you I am aware have been better brought up .
Parsing [sent. 3861 len. 14]: Your responsibility therefore becomes the greater in assisting them in their villainy . ''
Parsing [sent. 3862 len. 37]: `` You had better not let them hear you , Mr Evelyn , '' replied Gough , at last , in something like a surly tone ; `` I would not answer for the consequences . ''
Parsing [sent. 3863 len. 12]: `` Those I do not fear , '' the other answered .
Parsing [sent. 3864 len. 77]: `` The results of this transaction can make very little difference to a man on the verge of the grave , who has outlived all his relatives , and has nothing left to fall back upon but the memory of his misfortunes : but to one in the prime of life like yourself , who can boast of friends and relatives who feel an interest in your good name , these results must be serious indeed .
Parsing [sent. 3865 len. 55]: What must be the feelings of your respectable father when he learns that you have joined a gang of pirates ; how intense must be the grief of your amiable mother when she hears that you have paid the penalty that must sooner or later overtake you for embracing so lawless a life . ''
Parsing [sent. 3866 len. 35]: `` Come , Mr Evelyn , '' exclaimed Gough , though with a tremulousness in his voice that betrayed the state of his feelings , `` you have no right to preach to me .
Parsing [sent. 3867 len. 12]: I have done as much as I could for you all .
Parsing [sent. 3868 len. 26]: The men would have made short work with you , if I had not interposed , and pointed out to them this uninhabited island . ''
Parsing [sent. 3869 len. 20]: `` Where it seems you left a poor woman to be starved to death , '' continued Mr Evelyn .
Parsing [sent. 3870 len. 24]: `` It was no fault of mine , '' replied the man ; `` I did all I could to prevent it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3871 len. 28]: `` It would have been more manly if you had remained with her on this rock , and left your cowardly associates to take their selfish course .
Parsing [sent. 3872 len. 25]: But you are weak and irresolute , John Gough ; too easily persuaded into evil , too slow to follow the impulses of good .
Parsing [sent. 3873 len. 24]: The murder of that poor woman is as much your deed as if you had blown her brains out before you abandoned her .
Parsing [sent. 3874 len. 17]: Indeed I do not know but what the latter would have been the less criminal . ''
Parsing [sent. 3875 len. 6]: John Gough made no answer .
Parsing [sent. 3876 len. 34]: I do not think , however , his mind was quite easy under this accusation , for he seemed restless , and kept playing with his pistols , with his eyes cast down .
Parsing [sent. 3877 len. 21]: `` Your complicity in this mutiny , too , John Gough , is equally inexcusable , '' continued Mr Evelyn .
Parsing [sent. 3878 len. 37]: `` It was your duty to have stood by Captain Manvers and his officers , by which you would have earned their eternal gratitude , and a handsome provision from the owners of the vessel . ''
Parsing [sent. 3879 len. 20]: `` It 's no use talking of these things now , Mr Evelyn , '' said Gough , hurriedly .
Parsing [sent. 3880 len. 7]: `` I have taken my course .
Parsing [sent. 3881 len. 8]: It is too late to turn back .
Parsing [sent. 3882 len. 27]: Would to God , '' he added , dashing his hand violently against his brow , `` I had had nothing to do with it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3883 len. 44]: `` It is never too late , John Gough , to do good , '' here cried out Mrs Reichardt , as she rose from her place of concealment , as much to my surprise as that of all who could observe her .
Parsing [sent. 3884 len. 48]: But nothing could equal the astonishment of Gough when he first caught sight of her features ; -- he sprang to his feet , leaving his pistols on the ground , and clasping his hands together , exclaimed , `` Thank God , she is safe ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3885 len. 15]: `` Yes , '' she replied , approaching him and taking his hand kindly .
Parsing [sent. 3886 len. 17]: `` By an interposition of Providence , you are saved from the guilt of one murder .
Parsing [sent. 3887 len. 26]: In the name of that God who has so signally preserved you against yourself , I command you to abandon your present wicked designs . ''
Parsing [sent. 3888 len. 33]: The man hesitated , but it seemed as if he could not take his gaze from her face , and it was evident that her presence exerted an extraordinary influence over him .
Parsing [sent. 3889 len. 78]: In the meantime I had made my appearance on the scene , not less to the astonishment of the lookers-on ; and my first act was to take possession of the pair of pistols that Gough had left on the ground ; my next to hurry to the group of captives , who had been regarding us , in a state as it were of perfect bewilderment , and with my American knife to cut their bonds .
Parsing [sent. 3890 len. 14]: `` I will do whatever you think proper , '' said John Gough .
Parsing [sent. 3891 len. 28]: `` Believe me I have been reluctantly led into this , and joined the mutiny knowing that I should have been murdered if I did not . ''
Parsing [sent. 3892 len. 31]: `` You must endeavour to make what amends are in your power , '' continued Mrs Reichardt , `` by assisting your officers in recovering possession of the ship . ''
Parsing [sent. 3893 len. 17]: `` I will gladly assist in whatever they may think feasible , '' said the man .
Parsing [sent. 3894 len. 37]: `` But we must first secure the desperate fellows who have just left us , and as we are but poorly provided with weapons , that of itself will be a service of no slight danger .
Parsing [sent. 3895 len. 28]: To get possession of the ship I am afraid will be still more hazardous ; but you shall find me in the front of every danger . ''
Parsing [sent. 3896 len. 100]: Here Captain Manvers and the others came up to where John Gough and Mrs Reichardt were conversing ; he heard Gough 's last speech , and he was going to say something , when I interposed by stating that there was no time now for explanations , for in a few minutes the fellows who had gone to the hut would return , and the only way to prepare for them was for the whole party to go to our house , to which Mrs Reichardt would lead them , where they would find plenty of arms and ammunition .
Parsing [sent. 3897 len. 31]: In the meantime I would keep watch , and observe their motions , and by firing one of the pistols would signal to them if I was in any danger .
Parsing [sent. 3898 len. 25]: Lastly , I recommended that the oars should be removed from the boat , to prevent the mutineers making their escape to the ship .
Parsing [sent. 3899 len. 8]: My appearance and discourse attracted general attention .
Parsing [sent. 3900 len. 50]: I particularly noticed that Mr Evelyn started as soon as he caught sight of me , and appeared to observe me with singular carefulness ; but that , no doubt , arose from my unexpected address , and the strange way in which I had presented myself before him .
Parsing [sent. 3901 len. 29]: The Captain approving of my proposal , the whole party , after taking away the boat 's oars , moved off rapidly in the direction of the house .
Parsing [sent. 3902 len. 16]: I again concealed myself in the grass , and waited the return of the mutineers .
Parsing [sent. 3903 len. 7]: They did not remain away long .
Parsing [sent. 3904 len. 25]: I could hear them approaching , for they laughed and shouted as they went along loud enough to be heard at a considerable distance .
Parsing [sent. 3905 len. 25]: When they began to descend the rocks , they passed so close to me , that I could hear every word that was spoken .
Parsing [sent. 3906 len. 36]: `` Well , flesh is grass , as the parson says , '' said Jack ; `` they must have died sooner or later , if we had n't parted company with so little ceremony .
Parsing [sent. 3907 len. 4]: But , hallo !
Parsing [sent. 3908 len. 5]: my eyes and limbs !
Parsing [sent. 3909 len. 5]: Where 's John Gough ?
Parsing [sent. 3910 len. 5]: Where 's the captain ?
Parsing [sent. 3911 len. 7]: Where 's all on 'em ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3912 len. 36]: It is impossible to express the astonishment of the men on reaching the spot where they had so lately left their prisoners , and discovering that not a trace of them was to be seen .
Parsing [sent. 3913 len. 30]: At first they imagined that they had escaped in the boat , but as soon as they saw that the boat was safe , they gave up that idea .
Parsing [sent. 3914 len. 30]: Then they fancied John Gough had taken the prisoners to stroll a little distance inland , and they began to shout as loud as their lungs would permit them .
Parsing [sent. 3915 len. 53]: Receiving no response , they uttered many strange ejaculations , which I could not then understand , but which I have since learned were profane oaths ; and seemed at a loss what to do , whether to wander about the island in search of them , or return to their ship .
Parsing [sent. 3916 len. 37]: Only one chanced to be for the former , and the others overruled him , not thinking it was worth their while to take so much trouble as to go rambling about in a strange place .
Parsing [sent. 3917 len. 27]: They seemed bent on taking to the boat , when one of them suggested they might get into a scrape if they returned without their companion .
Parsing [sent. 3918 len. 11]: They finally resolved on sitting down and waiting his return .
Parsing [sent. 3919 len. 42]: Presently , one complained he was very sleepy , as he had been too busy mutineering to turn into his hammock the previous night , and the others acknowledged they also felt an equal want of rest from the same cause .
Parsing [sent. 3920 len. 5]: Each began to yawn .
Parsing [sent. 3921 len. 34]: They laid themselves at their full length along the grass , and in a short time I could hear by their snoring , as Jackson used to do , that they were asleep .
Parsing [sent. 3922 len. 35]: I now crept stealthily towards them on my hands and knees , and they were in such a profound sleep , that I had no difficulty whatever in removing the pistols from their belts .
Parsing [sent. 3923 len. 42]: I had just succeeded in this , when I beheld the captain , and John Gough , and Mr Evelyn , and all the rest of them , well armed with guns and pistols , approaching the place where we were .
Parsing [sent. 3924 len. 22]: In a few minutes afterwards the mutineers were made prisoners , without their having an opportunity of making the slightest resistance .
Parsing [sent. 3925 len. 76]: I was much complimented by the captain for the dexterity with which I had disarmed them ; but while I was in conversation with him , it is impossible to express the surprise I felt , on seeing Mr Evelyn suddenly rush towards me from the side of Mrs Reichardt , with whom he had been talking , and , embracing me with the most moving demonstrations of affection , claim me as his grandson .
Parsing [sent. 3926 len. 6]: The mystery was soon explained .
Parsing [sent. 3927 len. 74]: Mr Evelyn had met so many losses in business as a merchant , that he took the opportunity of a son of his old clerk -- who had become a captain of a fine ship , employed in the South American trade -- being about to proceed on a trading voyage to that part of the world , to sail in his vessel with a consignment of goods for the South American market .
Parsing [sent. 3928 len. 44]: He had also another object , which was to inquire after the fate of his long-lost daughter and son-in-law , of whom he had received no certain intelligence , since the latter took ship with the diamonds he had purchased to return home .
Parsing [sent. 3929 len. 40]: The vessel in which they sailed had never been heard of since ; and Mr Evelyn had long given up all hopes of seeing either of them again , or the valuable property with which they had been entrusted .
Parsing [sent. 3930 len. 45]: On their going to the house , he had asked Mrs Reichardt my name , stating that I so strongly resembled a very dear friend of his , he believed had perished many years ago , that he felt quite an interest in me .
Parsing [sent. 3931 len. 91]: The answer he received led to a series of the most earnest inquiries , and Mrs Reichardt satisfied him on every point , showed him all the property that had formerly been in the possession of Mrs Henniker and her husband : related Jackson 's story , and convinced him , that though he had lost the daughter for whom he had mourned so long , her representative existed in the Little Savage , who was saving him from the fate for which he had been preserved by the mutineers .
Parsing [sent. 3932 len. 53]: I have only to add , that I had the happiness of restoring to my grandfather the diamonds I had obtained from Jackson , which were no doubt very welcome to him , for they not only restored him to affluence , but made him one of the richest merchants upon Change .
Parsing [sent. 3933 len. 23]: I was also instrumental in obtaining for the captain the command of his ship , and of restoring discipline amongst the crew .
Parsing [sent. 3934 len. 45]: The ringleaders of the mutiny were thrown into irons , and taken home for trial ; this resulted in one or two of them being hanged by way of example , and these happened to be the men who so barbarously deserted Mrs Reichardt .
Parsing [sent. 3935 len. 37]: She accompanied me to England in Captain Manvers 's vessel , for when he heard of the obligations I owed her , my grandfather decided that she should remain with us as long as she lived .
Parsing [sent. 3936 len. 47]: We however did not leave the island until we had shown my grandfather , the captain , and his officers , what we had effected during our stay , and every one was surprised that we could have produced a flourishing farm upon a barren rock .
Parsing [sent. 3937 len. 41]: I did not fail to show the places where I had had my fight with the python , and where I had been pursued by the sharks , and my narrative of both incidents seemed to astonish my hearers exceedingly .
Parsing [sent. 3938 len. 39]: I must not forget to add , that the day before our departure , John Gough came to me privately , and requested my good offices with the captain , that he might be left on the island .
Parsing [sent. 3939 len. 37]: He had become a very different character to what he had previously been ; and as there could be no question that the repentance he assumed was sincere , I said all I could for him .
Parsing [sent. 3940 len. 39]: My recommendation was successful , and I transferred to John Gough all my farm , farming stock , and agricultural implements ; moreover , promised to send him whatever he might further require to make his position comfortable .
Parsing [sent. 3941 len. 28]: He expressed great gratitude , but desired nothing ; only that his family might know that he was well off , and was not likely to return .
Parsing [sent. 3942 len. 64]: Perhaps John Gough did not like the risk he ran of being tried for mutiny , or was averse to sailing with his former comrades ; but whatever was the cause of his resolution , it is certain that he remained behind when the ship left the island , and may be there to this hour for all I know to the contrary .
Parsing [sent. 3943 len. 41]: We made a quick voyage to England , and as my readers will no doubt be glad to hear , the Little Savage landed safely at Plymouth , and was soon cordially welcomed to his grandfather 's house in London .
Parsing [sent. 3944 len. 3]: THE END .
