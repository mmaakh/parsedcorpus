Parsing [sent. 1 len. 61]: A TRAMP ABROAD , Part 1 By Mark Twain -LRB- Samuel L. Clemens -RRB- First published in 1880 CHAPTER I -LSB- The Knighted Knave of Bergen -RSB- One day it occurred to me that it had been many years since the world had been afforded the spectacle of a man adventurous enough to undertake a journey through Europe on foot .
Parsing [sent. 2 len. 19]: After much thought , I decided that I was a person fitted to furnish to mankind this spectacle .
Parsing [sent. 3 len. 7]: So I determined to do it .
Parsing [sent. 4 len. 7]: This was in March , 1878 .
Parsing [sent. 5 len. 29]: I looked about me for the right sort of person to accompany me in the capacity of agent , and finally hired a Mr. Harris for this service .
Parsing [sent. 6 len. 12]: It was also my purpose to study art while in Europe .
Parsing [sent. 7 len. 10]: Mr. Harris was in sympathy with me in this .
Parsing [sent. 8 len. 22]: He was as much of an enthusiast in art as I was , and not less anxious to learn to paint .
Parsing [sent. 9 len. 12]: I desired to learn the German language ; so did Harris .
Parsing [sent. 10 len. 23]: Toward the middle of April we sailed in the HOLSATIA , Captain Brandt , and had a very pleasant trip , indeed .
Parsing [sent. 11 len. 41]: After a brief rest at Hamburg , we made preparations for a long pedestrian trip southward in the soft spring weather , but at the last moment we changed the program , for private reasons , and took the express-train .
Parsing [sent. 12 len. 15]: We made a short halt at Frankfort-on-the-Main , and found it an interesting city .
Parsing [sent. 13 len. 31]: I would have liked to visit the birthplace of Gutenburg , but it could not be done , as no memorandum of the site of the house has been kept .
Parsing [sent. 14 len. 11]: So we spent an hour in the Goethe mansion instead .
Parsing [sent. 15 len. 26]: The city permits this house to belong to private parties , instead of gracing and dignifying herself with the honor of possessing and protecting it .
Parsing [sent. 16 len. 21]: Frankfort is one of the sixteen cities which have the distinction of being the place where the following incident occurred .
Parsing [sent. 17 len. 37]: Charlemagne , while chasing the Saxons -LRB- as HE said -RRB- , or being chased by them -LRB- as THEY said -RRB- , arrived at the bank of the river at dawn , in a fog .
Parsing [sent. 18 len. 23]: The enemy were either before him or behind him ; but in any case he wanted to get across , very badly .
Parsing [sent. 19 len. 16]: He would have given anything for a guide , but none was to be had .
Parsing [sent. 20 len. 15]: Presently he saw a deer , followed by her young , approach the water .
Parsing [sent. 21 len. 17]: He watched her , judging that she would seek a ford , and he was right .
Parsing [sent. 22 len. 9]: She waded over , and the army followed .
Parsing [sent. 23 len. 40]: So a great Frankish victory or defeat was gained or avoided ; and in order to commemorate the episode , Charlemagne commanded a city to be built there , which he named Frankfort -- the ford of the Franks .
Parsing [sent. 24 len. 14]: None of the other cities where this event happened were named for it .
Parsing [sent. 25 len. 14]: This is good evidence that Frankfort was the first place it occurred at .
Parsing [sent. 26 len. 26]: Frankfort has another distinction -- it is the birthplace of the German alphabet ; or at least of the German word for alphabet -- BUCHSTABEN .
Parsing [sent. 27 len. 19]: They say that the first movable types were made on birch sticks -- BUCHSTABE -- hence the name .
Parsing [sent. 28 len. 11]: I was taught a lesson in political economy in Frankfort .
Parsing [sent. 29 len. 14]: I had brought from home a box containing a thousand very cheap cigars .
Parsing [sent. 30 len. 40]: By way of experiment , I stepped into a little shop in a queer old back street , took four gaily decorated boxes of wax matches and three cigars , and laid down a silver piece worth 48 cents .
Parsing [sent. 31 len. 8]: The man gave me 43 cents change .
Parsing [sent. 32 len. 32]: In Frankfort everybody wears clean clothes , and I think we noticed that this strange thing was the case in Hamburg , too , and in the villages along the road .
Parsing [sent. 33 len. 20]: Even in the narrowest and poorest and most ancient quarters of Frankfort neat and clean clothes were the rule .
Parsing [sent. 34 len. 19]: The little children of both sexes were nearly always nice enough to take into a body 's lap .
Parsing [sent. 35 len. 18]: And as for the uniforms of the soldiers , they were newness and brightness carried to perfection .
Parsing [sent. 36 len. 14]: One could never detect a smirch or a grain of dust upon them .
Parsing [sent. 37 len. 28]: The street-car conductors and drivers wore pretty uniforms which seemed to be just out of the bandbox , and their manners were as fine as their clothes .
Parsing [sent. 38 len. 22]: In one of the shops I had the luck to stumble upon a book which has charmed me nearly to death .
Parsing [sent. 39 len. 71]: It is entitled THE LEGENDS OF THE RHINE FROM BASLE TO ROTTERDAM , by F. J. Kiefer ; translated by L. W. Garnham , B.A. All tourists MENTION the Rhine legends -- in that sort of way which quietly pretends that the mentioner has been familiar with them all his life , and that the reader can not possibly be ignorant of them -- but no tourist ever TELLS them .
Parsing [sent. 40 len. 36]: So this little book fed me in a very hungry place ; and I , in my turn , intend to feed my reader , with one or two little lunches from the same larder .
Parsing [sent. 41 len. 43]: I shall not mar Garnham 's translation by meddling with its English ; for the most toothsome thing about it is its quaint fashion of building English sentences on the German plan -- and punctuating them accordingly to no plan at all .
Parsing [sent. 42 len. 71]: In the chapter devoted to `` Legends of Frankfort , '' I find the following : `` THE KNAVE OF BERGEN '' `` In Frankfort at the Romer was a great mask-ball , at the coronation festival , and in the illuminated saloon , the clanging music invited to dance , and splendidly appeared the rich toilets and charms of the ladies , and the festively costumed Princes and Knights .
Parsing [sent. 43 len. 58]: All seemed pleasure , joy , and roguish gaiety , only one of the numerous guests had a gloomy exterior ; but exactly the black armor in which he walked about excited general attention , and his tall figure , as well as the noble propriety of his movements , attracted especially the regards of the ladies .
Parsing [sent. 44 len. 5]: Who the Knight was ?
Parsing [sent. 45 len. 17]: Nobody could guess , for his Vizier was well closed , and nothing made him recognizable .
Parsing [sent. 46 len. 33]: Proud and yet modest he advanced to the Empress ; bowed on one knee before her seat , and begged for the favor of a waltz with the Queen of the festival .
Parsing [sent. 47 len. 6]: And she allowed his request .
Parsing [sent. 48 len. 28]: With light and graceful steps he danced through the long saloon , with the sovereign who thought never to have found a more dexterous and excellent dancer .
Parsing [sent. 49 len. 48]: But also by the grace of his manner , and fine conversation he knew to win the Queen , and she graciously accorded him a second dance for which he begged , a third , and a fourth , as well as others were not refused him .
Parsing [sent. 50 len. 26]: How all regarded the happy dancer , how many envied him the high favor ; how increased curiosity , who the masked knight could be .
Parsing [sent. 51 len. 34]: `` Also the Emperor became more and more excited with curiosity , and with great suspense one awaited the hour , when according to mask-law , each masked guest must make himself known .
Parsing [sent. 52 len. 46]: This moment came , but although all other unmasked ; the secret knight still refused to allow his features to be seen , till at last the Queen driven by curiosity , and vexed at the obstinate refusal ; commanded him to open his Vizier .
Parsing [sent. 53 len. 15]: He opened it , and none of the high ladies and knights knew him .
Parsing [sent. 54 len. 34]: But from the crowded spectators , 2 officials advanced , who recognized the black dancer , and horror and terror spread in the saloon , as they said who the supposed knight was .
Parsing [sent. 55 len. 7]: It was the executioner of Bergen .
Parsing [sent. 56 len. 38]: But glowing with rage , the King commanded to seize the criminal and lead him to death , who had ventured to dance , with the queen ; so disgraced the Empress , and insulted the crown .
Parsing [sent. 57 len. 36]: The culpable threw himself at the Emperor , and said -- '' ` Indeed I have heavily sinned against all noble guests assembled here , but most heavily against you my sovereign and my queen .
Parsing [sent. 58 len. 34]: The Queen is insulted by my haughtiness equal to treason , but no punishment even blood , will not be able to wash out the disgrace , which you have suffered by me .
Parsing [sent. 59 len. 4]: Therefore oh King !
Parsing [sent. 60 len. 21]: allow me to propose a remedy , to efface the shame , and to render it as if not done .
Parsing [sent. 61 len. 27]: Draw your sword and knight me , then I will throw down my gauntlet , to everyone who dares to speak disrespectfully of my king . '
Parsing [sent. 62 len. 51]: `` The Emperor was surprised at this bold proposal , however it appeared the wisest to him ; ` You are a knave , ' he replied after a moment 's consideration , ` however your advice is good , and displays prudence , as your offense shows adventurous courage .
Parsing [sent. 63 len. 88]: Well then , ' and gave him the knight-stroke ` so I raise you to nobility , who begged for grace for your offense now kneels before me , rise as knight ; knavish you have acted , and Knave of Bergen shall you be called henceforth , ' and gladly the Black knight rose ; three cheers were given in honor of the Emperor , and loud cries of joy testified the approbation with which the Queen danced still once with the Knave of Bergen . ''
Parsing [sent. 64 len. 19]: CHAPTER II Heidelberg -LSB- Landing a Monarch at Heidelberg -RSB- We stopped at a hotel by the railway-station .
Parsing [sent. 65 len. 38]: Next morning , as we sat in my room waiting for breakfast to come up , we got a good deal interested in something which was going on over the way , in front of another hotel .
Parsing [sent. 66 len. 29]: First , the personage who is called the PORTIER -LRB- who is not the PORTER , but is a sort of first-mate of a hotel -RRB- -LSB- 1 .
Parsing [sent. 67 len. 42]: See Appendix A -RSB- appeared at the door in a spick-and-span new blue cloth uniform , decorated with shining brass buttons , and with bands of gold lace around his cap and wristbands ; and he wore white gloves , too .
Parsing [sent. 68 len. 16]: He shed an official glance upon the situation , and then began to give orders .
Parsing [sent. 69 len. 50]: Two women-servants came out with pails and brooms and brushes , and gave the sidewalk a thorough scrubbing ; meanwhile two others scrubbed the four marble steps which led up to the door ; beyond these we could see some men-servants taking up the carpet of the grand staircase .
Parsing [sent. 70 len. 28]: This carpet was carried away and the last grain of dust beaten and banged and swept out of it ; then brought back and put down again .
Parsing [sent. 71 len. 14]: The brass stair-rods received an exhaustive polishing and were returned to their places .
Parsing [sent. 72 len. 29]: Now a troop of servants brought pots and tubs of blooming plants and formed them into a beautiful jungle about the door and the base of the staircase .
Parsing [sent. 73 len. 30]: Other servants adorned all the balconies of the various stories with flowers and banners ; others ascended to the roof and hoisted a great flag on a staff there .
Parsing [sent. 74 len. 29]: Now came some more chamber-maids and retouched the sidewalk , and afterward wiped the marble steps with damp cloths and finished by dusting them off with feather brushes .
Parsing [sent. 75 len. 23]: Now a broad black carpet was brought out and laid down the marble steps and out across the sidewalk to the curbstone .
Parsing [sent. 76 len. 43]: The PORTIER cast his eye along it , and found it was not absolutely straight ; he commanded it to be straightened ; the servants made the effort -- made several efforts , in fact -- but the PORTIER was not satisfied .
Parsing [sent. 77 len. 19]: He finally had it taken up , and then he put it down himself and got it right .
Parsing [sent. 78 len. 35]: At this stage of the proceedings , a narrow bright red carpet was unrolled and stretched from the top of the marble steps to the curbstone , along the center of the black carpet .
Parsing [sent. 79 len. 16]: This red path cost the PORTIER more trouble than even the black one had done .
Parsing [sent. 80 len. 23]: But he patiently fixed and refixed it until it was exactly right and lay precisely in the middle of the black carpet .
Parsing [sent. 81 len. 68]: In New York these performances would have gathered a mighty crowd of curious and intensely interested spectators ; but here it only captured an audience of half a dozen little boys who stood in a row across the pavement , some with their school-knapsacks on their backs and their hands in their pockets , others with arms full of bundles , and all absorbed in the show .
Parsing [sent. 82 len. 19]: Occasionally one of them skipped irreverently over the carpet and took up a position on the other side .
Parsing [sent. 83 len. 7]: This always visibly annoyed the PORTIER .
Parsing [sent. 84 len. 6]: Now came a waiting interval .
Parsing [sent. 85 len. 69]: The landlord , in plain clothes , and bareheaded , placed himself on the bottom marble step , abreast the PORTIER , who stood on the other end of the same steps ; six or eight waiters , gloved , bareheaded , and wearing their whitest linen , their whitest cravats , and their finest swallow-tails , grouped themselves about these chiefs , but leaving the carpetway clear .
Parsing [sent. 86 len. 10]: Nobody moved or spoke any more but only waited .
Parsing [sent. 87 len. 26]: In a short time the shrill piping of a coming train was heard , and immediately groups of people began to gather in the street .
Parsing [sent. 88 len. 21]: Two or three open carriages arrived , and deposited some maids of honor and some male officials at the hotel .
Parsing [sent. 89 len. 32]: Presently another open carriage brought the Grand Duke of Baden , a stately man in uniform , who wore the handsome brass-mounted , steel-spiked helmet of the army on his head .
Parsing [sent. 90 len. 48]: Last came the Empress of Germany and the Grand Duchess of Baden in a closed carriage ; these passed through the low-bowing groups of servants and disappeared in the hotel , exhibiting to us only the backs of their heads , and then the show was over .
Parsing [sent. 91 len. 18]: It appears to be as difficult to land a monarch as it is to launch a ship .
Parsing [sent. 92 len. 5]: But as to Heidelberg .
Parsing [sent. 93 len. 14]: The weather was growing pretty warm , -- very warm , in fact .
Parsing [sent. 94 len. 21]: So we left the valley and took quarters at the Schloss Hotel , on the hill , above the Castle .
Parsing [sent. 95 len. 51]: Heidelberg lies at the mouth of a narrow gorge -- a gorge the shape of a shepherd 's crook ; if one looks up it he perceives that it is about straight , for a mile and a half , then makes a sharp curve to the right and disappears .
Parsing [sent. 96 len. 54]: This gorge -- along whose bottom pours the swift Neckar -- is confined between -LRB- or cloven through -RRB- a couple of long , steep ridges , a thousand feet high and densely wooded clear to their summits , with the exception of one section which has been shaved and put under cultivation .
Parsing [sent. 97 len. 57]: These ridges are chopped off at the mouth of the gorge and form two bold and conspicuous headlands , with Heidelberg nestling between them ; from their bases spreads away the vast dim expanse of the Rhine valley , and into this expanse the Neckar goes wandering in shining curves and is presently lost to view .
Parsing [sent. 98 len. 48]: Now if one turns and looks up the gorge once more , he will see the Schloss Hotel on the right perched on a precipice overlooking the Neckar -- a precipice which is so sumptuously cushioned and draped with foliage that no glimpse of the rock appears .
Parsing [sent. 99 len. 7]: The building seems very airily situated .
Parsing [sent. 100 len. 41]: It has the appearance of being on a shelf half-way up the wooded mountainside ; and as it is remote and isolated , and very white , it makes a strong mark against the lofty leafy rampart at its back .
Parsing [sent. 101 len. 30]: This hotel had a feature which was a decided novelty , and one which might be adopted with advantage by any house which is perched in a commanding situation .
Parsing [sent. 102 len. 28]: This feature may be described as a series of glass-enclosed parlors CLINGING TO THE OUTSIDE OF THE HOUSE , one against each and every bed-chamber and drawing-room .
Parsing [sent. 103 len. 14]: They are like long , narrow , high-ceiled bird-cages hung against the building .
Parsing [sent. 104 len. 22]: My room was a corner room , and had two of these things , a north one and a west one .
Parsing [sent. 105 len. 20]: From the north cage one looks up the Neckar gorge ; from the west one he looks down it .
Parsing [sent. 106 len. 22]: This last affords the most extensive view , and it is one of the loveliest that can be imagined , too .
Parsing [sent. 107 len. 25]: Out of a billowy upheaval of vivid green foliage , a rifle-shot removed , rises the huge ruin of Heidelberg Castle , -LSB- 2 .
Parsing [sent. 108 len. 37]: See Appendix B -RSB- with empty window arches , ivy-mailed battlements , moldering towers -- the Lear of inanimate nature -- deserted , discrowned , beaten by the storms , but royal still , and beautiful .
Parsing [sent. 109 len. 42]: It is a fine sight to see the evening sunlight suddenly strike the leafy declivity at the Castle 's base and dash up it and drench it as with a luminous spray , while the adjacent groves are in deep shadow .
Parsing [sent. 110 len. 20]: Behind the Castle swells a great dome-shaped hill , forest-clad , and beyond that a nobler and loftier one .
Parsing [sent. 111 len. 22]: The Castle looks down upon the compact brown-roofed town ; and from the town two picturesque old bridges span the river .
Parsing [sent. 112 len. 45]: Now the view broadens ; through the gateway of the sentinel headlands you gaze out over the wide Rhine plain , which stretches away , softly and richly tinted , grows gradually and dreamily indistinct , and finally melts imperceptibly into the remote horizon .
Parsing [sent. 113 len. 21]: I have never enjoyed a view which had such a serene and satisfying charm about it as this one gives .
Parsing [sent. 114 len. 46]: The first night we were there , we went to bed and to sleep early ; but I awoke at the end of two or three hours , and lay a comfortable while listening to the soothing patter of the rain against the balcony windows .
Parsing [sent. 115 len. 34]: I took it to be rain , but it turned out to be only the murmur of the restless Neckar , tumbling over her dikes and dams far below , in the gorge .
Parsing [sent. 116 len. 15]: I got up and went into the west balcony and saw a wonderful sight .
Parsing [sent. 117 len. 100]: Away down on the level under the black mass of the Castle , the town lay , stretched along the river , its intricate cobweb of streets jeweled with twinkling lights ; there were rows of lights on the bridges ; these flung lances of light upon the water , in the black shadows of the arches ; and away at the extremity of all this fairy spectacle blinked and glowed a massed multitude of gas-jets which seemed to cover acres of ground ; it was as if all the diamonds in the world had been spread out there .
Parsing [sent. 118 len. 19]: I did not know before , that a half-mile of sextuple railway-tracks could be made such an adornment .
Parsing [sent. 119 len. 50]: One thinks Heidelberg by day -- with its surroundings -- is the last possibility of the beautiful ; but when he sees Heidelberg by night , a fallen Milky Way , with that glittering railway constellation pinned to the border , he requires time to consider upon the verdict .
Parsing [sent. 120 len. 21]: One never tires of poking about in the dense woods that clothe all these lofty Neckar hills to their tops .
Parsing [sent. 121 len. 30]: The great deeps of a boundless forest have a beguiling and impressive charm in any country ; but German legends and fairy tales have given these an added charm .
Parsing [sent. 122 len. 21]: They have peopled all that region with gnomes , and dwarfs , and all sorts of mysterious and uncanny creatures .
Parsing [sent. 123 len. 37]: At the time I am writing of , I had been reading so much of this literature that sometimes I was not sure but I was beginning to believe in the gnomes and fairies as realities .
Parsing [sent. 124 len. 74]: One afternoon I got lost in the woods about a mile from the hotel , and presently fell into a train of dreamy thought about animals which talk , and kobolds , and enchanted folk , and the rest of the pleasant legendary stuff ; and so , by stimulating my fancy , I finally got to imagining I glimpsed small flitting shapes here and there down the columned aisles of the forest .
Parsing [sent. 125 len. 12]: It was a place which was peculiarly meet for the occasion .
Parsing [sent. 126 len. 80]: It was a pine wood , with so thick and soft a carpet of brown needles that one 's footfall made no more sound than if he were treading on wool ; the tree-trunks were as round and straight and smooth as pillars , and stood close together ; they were bare of branches to a point about twenty-five feet above-ground , and from there upward so thick with boughs that not a ray of sunlight could pierce through .
Parsing [sent. 127 len. 34]: The world was bright with sunshine outside , but a deep and mellow twilight reigned in there , and also a deep silence so profound that I seemed to hear my own breathings .
Parsing [sent. 128 len. 42]: When I had stood ten minutes , thinking and imagining , and getting my spirit in tune with the place , and in the right mood to enjoy the supernatural , a raven suddenly uttered a horse croak over my head .
Parsing [sent. 129 len. 14]: It made me start ; and then I was angry because I started .
Parsing [sent. 130 len. 21]: I looked up , and the creature was sitting on a limb right over me , looking down at me .
Parsing [sent. 131 len. 35]: I felt something of the same sense of humiliation and injury which one feels when he finds that a human stranger has been clandestinely inspecting him in his privacy and mentally commenting upon him .
Parsing [sent. 132 len. 11]: I eyed the raven , and the raven eyed me .
Parsing [sent. 133 len. 7]: Nothing was said during some seconds .
Parsing [sent. 134 len. 46]: Then the bird stepped a little way along his limb to get a better point of observation , lifted his wings , stuck his head far down below his shoulders toward me and croaked again -- a croak with a distinctly insulting expression about it .
Parsing [sent. 135 len. 31]: If he had spoken in English he could not have said any more plainly than he did say in raven , `` Well , what do YOU want here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 136 len. 24]: I felt as foolish as if I had been caught in some mean act by a responsible being , and reproved for it .
Parsing [sent. 137 len. 16]: However , I made no reply ; I would not bandy words with a raven .
Parsing [sent. 138 len. 61]: The adversary waited a while , with his shoulders still lifted , his head thrust down between them , and his keen bright eye fixed on me ; then he threw out two or three more insults , which I could not understand , further than that I knew a portion of them consisted of language not used in church .
Parsing [sent. 139 len. 6]: I still made no reply .
Parsing [sent. 140 len. 9]: Now the adversary raised his head and called .
Parsing [sent. 141 len. 19]: There was an answering croak from a little distance in the wood -- evidently a croak of inquiry .
Parsing [sent. 142 len. 15]: The adversary explained with enthusiasm , and the other raven dropped everything and came .
Parsing [sent. 143 len. 28]: The two sat side by side on the limb and discussed me as freely and offensively as two great naturalists might discuss a new kind of bug .
Parsing [sent. 144 len. 8]: The thing became more and more embarrassing .
Parsing [sent. 145 len. 6]: They called in another friend .
Parsing [sent. 146 len. 5]: This was too much .
Parsing [sent. 147 len. 26]: I saw that they had the advantage of me , and so I concluded to get out of the scrape by walking out of it .
Parsing [sent. 148 len. 15]: They enjoyed my defeat as much as any low white people could have done .
Parsing [sent. 149 len. 35]: They craned their necks and laughed at me -LRB- for a raven CAN laugh , just like a man -RRB- , they squalled insulting remarks after me as long as they could see me .
Parsing [sent. 150 len. 39]: They were nothing but ravens -- I knew that -- what they thought of me could be a matter of no consequence -- and yet when even a raven shouts after you , `` What a hat ! ''
Parsing [sent. 151 len. 9]: `` Oh , pull down your vest ! ''
Parsing [sent. 152 len. 27]: and that sort of thing , it hurts you and humiliates you , and there is no getting around it with fine reasoning and pretty arguments .
Parsing [sent. 153 len. 9]: Animals talk to each other , of course .
Parsing [sent. 154 len. 21]: There can be no question about that ; but I suppose there are very few people who can understand them .
Parsing [sent. 155 len. 9]: I never knew but one man who could .
Parsing [sent. 156 len. 14]: I knew he could , however , because he told me so himself .
Parsing [sent. 157 len. 57]: He was a middle-aged , simple-hearted miner who had lived in a lonely corner of California , among the woods and mountains , a good many years , and had studied the ways of his only neighbors , the beasts and the birds , until he believed he could accurately translate any remark which they made .
Parsing [sent. 158 len. 5]: This was Jim Baker .
Parsing [sent. 159 len. 80]: According to Jim Baker , some animals have only a limited education , and some use only simple words , and scarcely ever a comparison or a flowery figure ; whereas , certain other animals have a large vocabulary , a fine command of language and a ready and fluent delivery ; consequently these latter talk a great deal ; they like it ; they are so conscious of their talent , and they enjoy `` showing off . ''
Parsing [sent. 160 len. 31]: Baker said , that after long and careful observation , he had come to the conclusion that the bluejays were the best talkers he had found among birds and beasts .
Parsing [sent. 161 len. 15]: Said he : `` There 's more TO a bluejay than any other creature .
Parsing [sent. 162 len. 32]: He has got more moods , and more different kinds of feelings than other creatures ; and , mind you , whatever a bluejay feels , he can put into language .
Parsing [sent. 163 len. 24]: And no mere commonplace language , either , but rattling , out-and-out book-talk -- and bristling with metaphor , too -- just bristling !
Parsing [sent. 164 len. 19]: And as for command of language -- why YOU never see a bluejay get stuck for a word .
Parsing [sent. 165 len. 5]: No man ever did .
Parsing [sent. 166 len. 7]: They just boil out of him !
Parsing [sent. 167 len. 31]: And another thing : I 've noticed a good deal , and there 's no bird , or cow , or anything that uses as good grammar as a bluejay .
Parsing [sent. 168 len. 9]: You may say a cat uses good grammar .
Parsing [sent. 169 len. 44]: Well , a cat does -- but you let a cat get excited once ; you let a cat get to pulling fur with another cat on a shed , nights , and you 'll hear grammar that will give you the lockjaw .
Parsing [sent. 170 len. 30]: Ignorant people think it 's the NOISE which fighting cats make that is so aggravating , but it ai n't so ; it 's the sickening grammar they use .
Parsing [sent. 171 len. 34]: Now I 've never heard a jay use bad grammar but very seldom ; and when they do , they are as ashamed as a human ; they shut right down and leave .
Parsing [sent. 172 len. 9]: `` You may call a jay a bird .
Parsing [sent. 173 len. 40]: Well , so he is , in a measure -- but he 's got feathers on him , and do n't belong to no church , perhaps ; but otherwise he is just as much human as you be .
Parsing [sent. 174 len. 8]: And I 'll tell you for why .
Parsing [sent. 175 len. 19]: A jay 's gifts , and instincts , and feelings , and interests , cover the whole ground .
Parsing [sent. 176 len. 12]: A jay has n't got any more principle than a Congressman .
Parsing [sent. 177 len. 37]: A jay will lie , a jay will steal , a jay will deceive , a jay will betray ; and four times out of five , a jay will go back on his solemnest promise .
Parsing [sent. 178 len. 20]: The sacredness of an obligation is such a thing which you ca n't cram into no bluejay 's head .
Parsing [sent. 179 len. 23]: Now , on top of all this , there 's another thing ; a jay can out-swear any gentleman in the mines .
Parsing [sent. 180 len. 7]: You think a cat can swear .
Parsing [sent. 181 len. 25]: Well , a cat can ; but you give a bluejay a subject that calls for his reserve-powers , and where is your cat ?
Parsing [sent. 182 len. 41]: Do n't talk to ME -- I know too much about this thing ; in the one little particular of scolding -- just good , clean , out-and-out scolding -- a bluejay can lay over anything , human or divine .
Parsing [sent. 183 len. 13]: Yes , sir , a jay is everything that a man is .
Parsing [sent. 184 len. 59]: A jay can cry , a jay can laugh , a jay can feel shame , a jay can reason and plan and discuss , a jay likes gossip and scandal , a jay has got a sense of humor , a jay knows when he is an ass just as well as you do -- maybe better .
Parsing [sent. 185 len. 18]: If a jay ai n't human , he better take in his sign , that 's all .
Parsing [sent. 186 len. 16]: Now I 'm going to tell you a perfectly true fact about some bluejays . ''
Parsing [sent. 187 len. 32]: CHAPTER III Baker 's Bluejay Yarn -LSB- What Stumped the Blue Jays -RSB- `` When I first begun to understand jay language correctly , there was a little incident happened here .
Parsing [sent. 188 len. 15]: Seven years ago , the last man in this region but me moved away .
Parsing [sent. 189 len. 39]: There stands his house -- been empty ever since ; a log house , with a plank roof -- just one big room , and no more ; no ceiling -- nothing between the rafters and the floor .
Parsing [sent. 190 len. 93]: Well , one Sunday morning I was sitting out here in front of my cabin , with my cat , taking the sun , and looking at the blue hills , and listening to the leaves rustling so lonely in the trees , and thinking of the home away yonder in the states , that I had n't heard from in thirteen years , when a bluejay lit on that house , with an acorn in his mouth , and says , ` Hello , I reckon I 've struck something . '
Parsing [sent. 191 len. 37]: When he spoke , the acorn dropped out of his mouth and rolled down the roof , of course , but he did n't care ; his mind was all on the thing he had struck .
Parsing [sent. 192 len. 8]: It was a knot-hole in the roof .
Parsing [sent. 193 len. 82]: He cocked his head to one side , shut one eye and put the other one to the hole , like a possum looking down a jug ; then he glanced up with his bright eyes , gave a wink or two with his wings -- which signifies gratification , you understand -- and says , ` It looks like a hole , it 's located like a hole -- blamed if I do n't believe it IS a hole ! '
Parsing [sent. 194 len. 47]: `` Then he cocked his head down and took another look ; he glances up perfectly joyful , this time ; winks his wings and his tail both , and says , ` Oh , no , this ai n't no fat thing , I reckon !
Parsing [sent. 195 len. 7]: If I ai n't in luck !
Parsing [sent. 196 len. 10]: -- Why it 's a perfectly elegant hole ! '
Parsing [sent. 197 len. 72]: So he flew down and got that acorn , and fetched it up and dropped it in , and was just tilting his head back , with the heavenliest smile on his face , when all of a sudden he was paralyzed into a listening attitude and that smile faded gradually out of his countenance like breath off 'n a razor , and the queerest look of surprise took its place .
Parsing [sent. 198 len. 15]: Then he says , ` Why , I did n't hear it fall ! '
Parsing [sent. 199 len. 44]: He cocked his eye at the hole again , and took a long look ; raised up and shook his head ; stepped around to the other side of the hole and took another look from that side ; shook his head again .
Parsing [sent. 200 len. 30]: He studied a while , then he just went into the Details -- walked round and round the hole and spied into it from every point of the compass .
Parsing [sent. 201 len. 3]: No use .
Parsing [sent. 202 len. 86]: Now he took a thinking attitude on the comb of the roof and scratched the back of his head with his right foot a minute , and finally says , ` Well , it 's too many for ME , that 's certain ; must be a mighty long hole ; however , I ai n't got no time to fool around here , I got to `` tend to business '' ; I reckon it 's all right -- chance it , anyway . '
Parsing [sent. 203 len. 38]: `` So he flew off and fetched another acorn and dropped it in , and tried to flirt his eye to the hole quick enough to see what become of it , but he was too late .
Parsing [sent. 204 len. 46]: He held his eye there as much as a minute ; then he raised up and sighed , and says , ` Confound it , I do n't seem to understand this thing , no way ; however , I 'll tackle her again . '
Parsing [sent. 205 len. 22]: He fetched another acorn , and done his level best to see what become of it , but he could n't .
Parsing [sent. 206 len. 33]: He says , ` Well , I never struck no such a hole as this before ; I 'm of the opinion it 's a totally new kind of a hole . '
Parsing [sent. 207 len. 7]: Then he begun to get mad .
Parsing [sent. 208 len. 49]: He held in for a spell , walking up and down the comb of the roof and shaking his head and muttering to himself ; but his feelings got the upper hand of him , presently , and he broke loose and cussed himself black in the face .
Parsing [sent. 209 len. 13]: I never see a bird take on so about a little thing .
Parsing [sent. 210 len. 71]: When he got through he walks to the hole and looks in again for half a minute ; then he says , ` Well , you 're a long hole , and a deep hole , and a mighty singular hole altogether -- but I 've started in to fill you , and I 'm damned if I DO N'T fill you , if it takes a hundred years ! '
Parsing [sent. 211 len. 9]: `` And with that , away he went .
Parsing [sent. 212 len. 12]: You never see a bird work so since you was born .
Parsing [sent. 213 len. 38]: He laid into his work like a nigger , and the way he hove acorns into that hole for about two hours and a half was one of the most exciting and astonishing spectacles I ever struck .
Parsing [sent. 214 len. 19]: He never stopped to take a look anymore -- he just hove 'em in and went for more .
Parsing [sent. 215 len. 17]: Well , at last he could hardly flop his wings , he was so tuckered out .
Parsing [sent. 216 len. 36]: He comes a-dropping down , once more , sweating like an ice-pitcher , dropped his acorn in and says , ` NOW I guess I 've got the bulge on you by this time ! '
Parsing [sent. 217 len. 8]: So he bent down for a look .
Parsing [sent. 218 len. 19]: If you 'll believe me , when his head come up again he was just pale with rage .
Parsing [sent. 219 len. 48]: He says , ` I 've shoveled acorns enough in there to keep the family thirty years , and if I can see a sign of one of 'em I wish I may land in a museum with a belly full of sawdust in two minutes ! '
Parsing [sent. 220 len. 34]: `` He just had strength enough to crawl up on to the comb and lean his back agin the chimbly , and then he collected his impressions and begun to free his mind .
Parsing [sent. 221 len. 26]: I see in a second that what I had mistook for profanity in the mines was only just the rudiments , as you may say .
Parsing [sent. 222 len. 22]: `` Another jay was going by , and heard him doing his devotions , and stops to inquire what was up .
Parsing [sent. 223 len. 33]: The sufferer told him the whole circumstance , and says , ` Now yonder 's the hole , and if you do n't believe me , go and look for yourself . '
Parsing [sent. 224 len. 25]: So this fellow went and looked , and comes back and says , ` How many did you say you put in there ? '
Parsing [sent. 225 len. 13]: ` Not any less than two tons , ' says the sufferer .
Parsing [sent. 226 len. 8]: The other jay went and looked again .
Parsing [sent. 227 len. 21]: He could n't seem to make it out , so he raised a yell , and three more jays come .
Parsing [sent. 228 len. 41]: They all examined the hole , they all made the sufferer tell it over again , then they all discussed it , and got off as many leather-headed opinions about it as an average crowd of humans could have done .
Parsing [sent. 229 len. 28]: `` They called in more jays ; then more and more , till pretty soon this whole region ` peared to have a blue flush about it .
Parsing [sent. 230 len. 24]: There must have been five thousand of them ; and such another jawing and disputing and ripping and cussing , you never heard .
Parsing [sent. 231 len. 30]: Every jay in the whole lot put his eye to the hole and delivered a more chuckle-headed opinion about the mystery than the jay that went there before him .
Parsing [sent. 232 len. 9]: They examined the house all over , too .
Parsing [sent. 233 len. 24]: The door was standing half open , and at last one old jay happened to go and light on it and look in .
Parsing [sent. 234 len. 12]: Of course , that knocked the mystery galley-west in a second .
Parsing [sent. 235 len. 12]: There lay the acorns , scattered all over the floor . .
Parsing [sent. 236 len. 9]: He flopped his wings and raised a whoop .
Parsing [sent. 237 len. 5]: ` Come here ! '
Parsing [sent. 238 len. 27]: he says , ` Come here , everybody ; hang 'd if this fool has n't been trying to fill up a house with acorns ! '
Parsing [sent. 239 len. 59]: They all came a-swooping down like a blue cloud , and as each fellow lit on the door and took a glance , the whole absurdity of the contract that that first jay had tackled hit him home and he fell over backward suffocating with laughter , and the next jay took his place and done the same .
Parsing [sent. 240 len. 28]: `` Well , sir , they roosted around here on the housetop and the trees for an hour , and guffawed over that thing like human beings .
Parsing [sent. 241 len. 23]: It ai n't any use to tell me a bluejay has n't got a sense of humor , because I know better .
Parsing [sent. 242 len. 5]: And memory , too .
Parsing [sent. 243 len. 22]: They brought jays here from all over the United States to look down that hole , every summer for three years .
Parsing [sent. 244 len. 5]: Other birds , too .
Parsing [sent. 245 len. 32]: And they could all see the point except an owl that come from Nova Scotia to visit the Yo Semite , and he took this thing in on his way back .
Parsing [sent. 246 len. 11]: He said he could n't see anything funny in it .
Parsing [sent. 247 len. 15]: But then he was a good deal disappointed about Yo Semite , too . ''
Parsing [sent. 248 len. 31]: CHAPTER IV Student Life -LSB- The Laborious Beer King -RSB- The summer semester was in full tide ; consequently the most frequent figure in and about Heidelberg was the student .
Parsing [sent. 249 len. 20]: Most of the students were Germans , of course , but the representatives of foreign lands were very numerous .
Parsing [sent. 250 len. 23]: They hailed from every corner of the globe -- for instruction is cheap in Heidelberg , and so is living , too .
Parsing [sent. 251 len. 26]: The Anglo-American Club , composed of British and American students , had twenty-five members , and there was still much material left to draw from .
Parsing [sent. 252 len. 30]: Nine-tenths of the Heidelberg students wore no badge or uniform ; the other tenth wore caps of various colors , and belonged to social organizations called `` corps . ''
Parsing [sent. 253 len. 30]: There were five corps , each with a color of its own ; there were white caps , blue caps , and red , yellow , and green ones .
Parsing [sent. 254 len. 12]: The famous duel-fighting is confined to the `` corps '' boys .
Parsing [sent. 255 len. 14]: The `` KNEIP '' seems to be a specialty of theirs , too .
Parsing [sent. 256 len. 24]: Kneips are held , now and then , to celebrate great occasions , like the election of a beer king , for instance .
Parsing [sent. 257 len. 54]: The solemnity is simple ; the five corps assemble at night , and at a signal they all fall loading themselves with beer , out of pint-mugs , as fast as possible , and each man keeps his own count -- usually by laying aside a lucifer match for each mug he empties .
Parsing [sent. 258 len. 6]: The election is soon decided .
Parsing [sent. 259 len. 27]: When the candidates can hold no more , a count is instituted and the one who has drank the greatest number of pints is proclaimed king .
Parsing [sent. 260 len. 25]: I was told that the last beer king elected by the corps -- or by his own capabilities -- emptied his mug seventy-five times .
Parsing [sent. 261 len. 35]: No stomach could hold all that quantity at one time , of course -- but there are ways of frequently creating a vacuum , which those who have been much at sea will understand .
Parsing [sent. 262 len. 23]: One sees so many students abroad at all hours , that he presently begins to wonder if they ever have any working-hours .
Parsing [sent. 263 len. 11]: Some of them have , some of them have n't .
Parsing [sent. 264 len. 29]: Each can choose for himself whether he will work or play ; for German university life is a very free life ; it seems to have no restraints .
Parsing [sent. 265 len. 33]: The student does not live in the college buildings , but hires his own lodgings , in any locality he prefers , and he takes his meals when and where he pleases .
Parsing [sent. 266 len. 21]: He goes to bed when it suits him , and does not get up at all unless he wants to .
Parsing [sent. 267 len. 22]: He is not entered at the university for any particular length of time ; so he is likely to change about .
Parsing [sent. 268 len. 8]: He passes no examinations upon entering college .
Parsing [sent. 269 len. 32]: He merely pays a trifling fee of five or ten dollars , receives a card entitling him to the privileges of the university , and that is the end of it .
Parsing [sent. 270 len. 15]: He is now ready for business -- or play , as he shall prefer .
Parsing [sent. 271 len. 17]: If he elects to work , he finds a large list of lectures to choose from .
Parsing [sent. 272 len. 23]: He selects the subjects which he will study , and enters his name for these studies ; but he can skip attendance .
Parsing [sent. 273 len. 40]: The result of this system is , that lecture-courses upon specialties of an unusual nature are often delivered to very slim audiences , while those upon more practical and every-day matters of education are delivered to very large ones .
Parsing [sent. 274 len. 26]: I heard of one case where , day after day , the lecturer 's audience consisted of three students -- and always the same three .
Parsing [sent. 275 len. 9]: But one day two of them remained away .
Parsing [sent. 276 len. 35]: The lecturer began as usual -- `` Gentlemen , '' -- then , without a smile , he corrected himself , saying -- `` Sir , '' -- and went on with his discourse .
Parsing [sent. 277 len. 42]: It is said that the vast majority of the Heidelberg students are hard workers , and make the most of their opportunities ; that they have no surplus means to spend in dissipation , and no time to spare for frolicking .
Parsing [sent. 278 len. 40]: One lecture follows right on the heels of another , with very little time for the student to get out of one hall and into the next ; but the industrious ones manage it by going on a trot .
Parsing [sent. 279 len. 33]: The professors assist them in the saving of their time by being promptly in their little boxed-up pulpits when the hours strike , and as promptly out again when the hour finishes .
Parsing [sent. 280 len. 13]: I entered an empty lecture-room one day just before the clock struck .
Parsing [sent. 281 len. 16]: The place had simple , unpainted pine desks and benches for about two hundred persons .
Parsing [sent. 282 len. 33]: About a minute before the clock struck , a hundred and fifty students swarmed in , rushed to their seats , immediately spread open their notebooks and dipped their pens in ink .
Parsing [sent. 283 len. 71]: When the clock began to strike , a burly professor entered , was received with a round of applause , moved swiftly down the center aisle , said `` Gentlemen , '' and began to talk as he climbed his pulpit steps ; and by the time he had arrived in his box and faced his audience , his lecture was well under way and all the pens were going .
Parsing [sent. 284 len. 76]: He had no notes , he talked with prodigious rapidity and energy for an hour -- then the students began to remind him in certain well-understood ways that his time was up ; he seized his hat , still talking , proceeded swiftly down his pulpit steps , got out the last word of his discourse as he struck the floor ; everybody rose respectfully , and he swept rapidly down the aisle and disappeared .
Parsing [sent. 285 len. 23]: An instant rush for some other lecture-room followed , and in a minute I was alone with the empty benches once more .
Parsing [sent. 286 len. 12]: Yes , without doubt , idle students are not the rule .
Parsing [sent. 287 len. 26]: Out of eight hundred in the town , I knew the faces of only about fifty ; but these I saw everywhere , and daily .
Parsing [sent. 288 len. 34]: They walked about the streets and the wooded hills , they drove in cabs , they boated on the river , they sipped beer and coffee , afternoons , in the Schloss gardens .
Parsing [sent. 289 len. 12]: A good many of them wore colored caps of the corps .
Parsing [sent. 290 len. 24]: They were finely and fashionably dressed , their manners were quite superb , and they led an easy , careless , comfortable life .
Parsing [sent. 291 len. 34]: If a dozen of them sat together and a lady or a gentleman passed whom one of them knew and saluted , they all rose to their feet and took off their caps .
Parsing [sent. 292 len. 34]: The members of a corps always received a fellow-member in this way , too ; but they paid no attention to members of other corps ; they did not seem to see them .
Parsing [sent. 293 len. 19]: This was not a discourtesy ; it was only a part of the elaborate and rigid corps etiquette .
Parsing [sent. 294 len. 33]: There seems to be no chilly distance existing between the German students and the professor ; but , on the contrary , a companionable intercourse , the opposite of chilliness and reserve .
Parsing [sent. 295 len. 36]: When the professor enters a beer-hall in the evening where students are gathered together , these rise up and take off their caps , and invite the old gentleman to sit with them and partake .
Parsing [sent. 296 len. 64]: He accepts , and the pleasant talk and the beer flow for an hour or two , and by and by the professor , properly charged and comfortable , gives a cordial good night , while the students stand bowing and uncovered ; and then he moves on his happy way homeward with all his vast cargo of learning afloat in his hold .
Parsing [sent. 297 len. 13]: Nobody finds fault or feels outraged ; no harm has been done .
Parsing [sent. 298 len. 18]: It seemed to be a part of corps etiquette to keep a dog or so , too .
Parsing [sent. 299 len. 31]: I mean a corps dog -- the common property of the organization , like the corps steward or head servant ; then there are other dogs , owned by individuals .
Parsing [sent. 300 len. 39]: On a summer afternoon in the Castle gardens , I have seen six students march solemnly into the grounds , in single file , each carrying a bright Chinese parasol and leading a prodigious dog by a string .
Parsing [sent. 301 len. 7]: It was a very imposing spectacle .
Parsing [sent. 302 len. 26]: Sometimes there would be as many dogs around the pavilion as students ; and of all breeds and of all degrees of beauty and ugliness .
Parsing [sent. 303 len. 49]: These dogs had a rather dry time of it ; for they were tied to the benches and had no amusement for an hour or two at a time except what they could get out of pawing at the gnats , or trying to sleep and not succeeding .
Parsing [sent. 304 len. 16]: However , they got a lump of sugar occasionally -- they were fond of that .
Parsing [sent. 305 len. 33]: It seemed right and proper that students should indulge in dogs ; but everybody else had them , too -- old men and young ones , old women and nice young ladies .
Parsing [sent. 306 len. 27]: If there is one spectacle that is unpleasanter than another , it is that of an elegantly dressed young lady towing a dog by a string .
Parsing [sent. 307 len. 13]: It is said to be the sign and symbol of blighted love .
Parsing [sent. 308 len. 30]: It seems to me that some other way of advertising it might be devised , which would be just as conspicuous and yet not so trying to the proprieties .
Parsing [sent. 309 len. 17]: It would be a mistake to suppose that the easy-going pleasure-seeking student carries an empty head .
Parsing [sent. 310 len. 4]: Just the contrary .
Parsing [sent. 311 len. 28]: He has spent nine years in the gymnasium , under a system which allowed him no freedom , but vigorously compelled him to work like a slave .
Parsing [sent. 312 len. 35]: Consequently , he has left the gymnasium with an education which is so extensive and complete , that the most a university can do for it is to perfect some of its profounder specialties .
Parsing [sent. 313 len. 44]: It is said that when a pupil leaves the gymnasium , he not only has a comprehensive education , but he KNOWS what he knows -- it is not befogged with uncertainty , it is burnt into him so that it will stay .
Parsing [sent. 314 len. 22]: For instance , he does not merely read and write Greek , but speaks it ; the same with the Latin .
Parsing [sent. 315 len. 14]: Foreign youth steer clear of the gymnasium ; its rules are too severe .
Parsing [sent. 316 len. 64]: They go to the university to put a mansard roof on their whole general education ; but the German student already has his mansard roof , so he goes there to add a steeple in the nature of some specialty , such as a particular branch of law , or diseases of the eye , or special study of the ancient Gothic tongues .
Parsing [sent. 317 len. 35]: So this German attends only the lectures which belong to the chosen branch , and drinks his beer and tows his dog around and has a general good time the rest of the day .
Parsing [sent. 318 len. 76]: He has been in rigid bondage so long that the large liberty of the university life is just what he needs and likes and thoroughly appreciates ; and as it can not last forever , he makes the most of it while it does last , and so lays up a good rest against the day that must see him put on the chains once more and enter the slavery of official or professional life .
Parsing [sent. 319 len. 32]: CHAPTER V At the Students ' Dueling-Ground -LSB- Dueling by Wholesale -RSB- One day in the interest of science my agent obtained permission to bring me to the students ' dueling-place .
Parsing [sent. 320 len. 54]: We crossed the river and drove up the bank a few hundred yards , then turned to the left , entered a narrow alley , followed it a hundred yards and arrived at a two-story public house ; we were acquainted with its outside aspect , for it was visible from the hotel .
Parsing [sent. 321 len. 26]: We went upstairs and passed into a large whitewashed apartment which was perhaps fifty feet long by thirty feet wide and twenty or twenty-five high .
Parsing [sent. 322 len. 6]: It was a well-lighted place .
Parsing [sent. 323 len. 5]: There was no carpet .
Parsing [sent. 324 len. 28]: Across one end and down both sides of the room extended a row of tables , and at these tables some fifty or seventy-five students -LSB- 1 .
Parsing [sent. 325 len. 7]: See Appendix C -RSB- were sitting .
Parsing [sent. 326 len. 34]: Some of them were sipping wine , others were playing cards , others chess , other groups were chatting together , and many were smoking cigarettes while they waited for the coming duels .
Parsing [sent. 327 len. 38]: Nearly all of them wore colored caps ; there were white caps , green caps , blue caps , red caps , and bright-yellow ones ; so , all the five corps were present in strong force .
Parsing [sent. 328 len. 38]: In the windows at the vacant end of the room stood six or eight , narrow-bladed swords with large protecting guards for the hand , and outside was a man at work sharpening others on a grindstone .
Parsing [sent. 329 len. 19]: He understood his business ; for when a sword left his hand one could shave himself with it .
Parsing [sent. 330 len. 23]: It was observable that the young gentlemen neither bowed to nor spoke with students whose caps differed in color from their own .
Parsing [sent. 331 len. 12]: This did not mean hostility , but only an armed neutrality .
Parsing [sent. 332 len. 44]: It was considered that a person could strike harder in the duel , and with a more earnest interest , if he had never been in a condition of comradeship with his antagonist ; therefore , comradeship between the corps was not permitted .
Parsing [sent. 333 len. 21]: At intervals the presidents of the five corps have a cold official intercourse with each other , but nothing further .
Parsing [sent. 334 len. 66]: For example , when the regular dueling-day of one of the corps approaches , its president calls for volunteers from among the membership to offer battle ; three or more respond -- but there must not be less than three ; the president lays their names before the other presidents , with the request that they furnish antagonists for these challengers from among their corps .
Parsing [sent. 335 len. 5]: This is promptly done .
Parsing [sent. 336 len. 15]: It chanced that the present occasion was the battle-day of the Red Cap Corps .
Parsing [sent. 337 len. 17]: They were the challengers , and certain caps of other colors had volunteered to meet them .
Parsing [sent. 338 len. 29]: The students fight duels in the room which I have described , TWO DAYS IN EVERY WEEK DURING SEVEN AND A HALF OR EIGHT MONTHS IN EVERY YEAR .
Parsing [sent. 339 len. 12]: This custom had continued in Germany two hundred and fifty years .
Parsing [sent. 340 len. 6]: To return to my narrative .
Parsing [sent. 341 len. 40]: A student in a white cap met us and introduced us to six or eight friends of his who also wore white caps , and while we stood conversing , two strange-looking figures were led in from another room .
Parsing [sent. 342 len. 8]: They were students panoplied for the duel .
Parsing [sent. 343 len. 76]: They were bareheaded ; their eyes were protected by iron goggles which projected an inch or more , the leather straps of which bound their ears flat against their heads were wound around and around with thick wrappings which a sword could not cut through ; from chin to ankle they were padded thoroughly against injury ; their arms were bandaged and rebandaged , layer upon layer , until they looked like solid black logs .
Parsing [sent. 344 len. 32]: These weird apparitions had been handsome youths , clad in fashionable attire , fifteen minutes before , but now they did not resemble any beings one ever sees unless in nightmares .
Parsing [sent. 345 len. 33]: They strode along , with their arms projecting straight out from their bodies ; they did not hold them out themselves , but fellow-students walked beside them and gave the needed support .
Parsing [sent. 346 len. 22]: There was a rush for the vacant end of the room , now , and we followed and got good places .
Parsing [sent. 347 len. 99]: The combatants were placed face to face , each with several members of his own corps about him to assist ; two seconds , well padded , and with swords in their hands , took their stations ; a student belonging to neither of the opposing corps placed himself in a good position to umpire the combat ; another student stood by with a watch and a memorandum-book to keep record of the time and the number and nature of the wounds ; a gray-haired surgeon was present with his lint , his bandages , and his instruments .
Parsing [sent. 348 len. 37]: After a moment 's pause the duelists saluted the umpire respectfully , then one after another the several officials stepped forward , gracefully removed their caps and saluted him also , and returned to their places .
Parsing [sent. 349 len. 23]: Everything was ready now ; students stood crowded together in the foreground , and others stood behind them on chairs and tables .
Parsing [sent. 350 len. 10]: Every face was turned toward the center of attraction .
Parsing [sent. 351 len. 19]: The combatants were watching each other with alert eyes ; a perfect stillness , a breathless interest reigned .
Parsing [sent. 352 len. 12]: I felt that I was going to see some wary work .
Parsing [sent. 353 len. 4]: But not so .
Parsing [sent. 354 len. 87]: The instant the word was given , the two apparitions sprang forward and began to rain blows down upon each other with such lightning rapidity that I could not quite tell whether I saw the swords or only flashes they made in the air ; the rattling din of these blows as they struck steel or paddings was something wonderfully stirring , and they were struck with such terrific force that I could not understand why the opposing sword was not beaten down under the assault .
Parsing [sent. 355 len. 41]: Presently , in the midst of the sword-flashes , I saw a handful of hair skip into the air as if it had lain loose on the victim 's head and a breath of wind had puffed it suddenly away .
Parsing [sent. 356 len. 7]: The seconds cried `` Halt ! ''
Parsing [sent. 357 len. 11]: and knocked up the combatants ' swords with their own .
Parsing [sent. 358 len. 80]: The duelists sat down ; a student official stepped forward , examined the wounded head and touched the place with a sponge once or twice ; the surgeon came and turned back the hair from the wound -- and revealed a crimson gash two or three inches long , and proceeded to bind an oval piece of leather and a bunch of lint over it ; the tally-keeper stepped up and tallied one for the opposition in his book .
Parsing [sent. 359 len. 45]: Then the duelists took position again ; a small stream of blood was flowing down the side of the injured man 's head , and over his shoulder and down his body to the floor , but he did not seem to mind this .
Parsing [sent. 360 len. 47]: The word was given , and they plunged at each other as fiercely as before ; once more the blows rained and rattled and flashed ; every few moments the quick-eyed seconds would notice that a sword was bent -- then they called `` Halt ! ''
Parsing [sent. 361 len. 15]: struck up the contending weapons , and an assisting student straightened the bent one .
Parsing [sent. 362 len. 33]: The wonderful turmoil went on -- presently a bright spark sprung from a blade , and that blade broken in several pieces , sent one of its fragments flying to the ceiling .
Parsing [sent. 363 len. 10]: A new sword was provided and the fight proceeded .
Parsing [sent. 364 len. 19]: The exercise was tremendous , of course , and in time the fighters began to show great fatigue .
Parsing [sent. 365 len. 36]: They were allowed to rest a moment , every little while ; they got other rests by wounding each other , for then they could sit down while the doctor applied the lint and bandages .
Parsing [sent. 366 len. 38]: The law is that the battle must continue fifteen minutes if the men can hold out ; and as the pauses do not count , this duel was protracted to twenty or thirty minutes , I judged .
Parsing [sent. 367 len. 17]: At last it was decided that the men were too much wearied to do battle longer .
Parsing [sent. 368 len. 12]: They were led away drenched with crimson from head to foot .
Parsing [sent. 369 len. 39]: That was a good fight , but it could not count , partly because it did not last the lawful fifteen minutes -LRB- of actual fighting -RRB- , and partly because neither man was disabled by his wound .
Parsing [sent. 370 len. 27]: It was a drawn battle , and corps law requires that drawn battles shall be refought as soon as the adversaries are well of their hurts .
Parsing [sent. 371 len. 65]: During the conflict , I had talked a little , now and then , with a young gentleman of the White Cap Corps , and he had mentioned that he was to fight next -- and had also pointed out his challenger , a young gentleman who was leaning against the opposite wall smoking a cigarette and restfully observing the duel then in progress .
Parsing [sent. 372 len. 63]: My acquaintanceship with a party to the coming contest had the effect of giving me a kind of personal interest in it ; I naturally wished he might win , and it was the reverse of pleasant to learn that he probably would not , because , although he was a notable swordsman , the challenger was held to be his superior .
Parsing [sent. 373 len. 17]: The duel presently began and in the same furious way which had marked the previous one .
Parsing [sent. 374 len. 27]: I stood close by , but could not tell which blows told and which did not , they fell and vanished so like flashes of light .
Parsing [sent. 375 len. 52]: They all seemed to tell ; the swords always bent over the opponents ' heads , from the forehead back over the crown , and seemed to touch , all the way ; but it was not so -- a protecting blade , invisible to me , was always interposed between .
Parsing [sent. 376 len. 45]: At the end of ten seconds each man had struck twelve or fifteen blows , and warded off twelve or fifteen , and no harm done ; then a sword became disabled , and a short rest followed whilst a new one was brought .
Parsing [sent. 377 len. 27]: Early in the next round the White Corps student got an ugly wound on the side of his head and gave his opponent one like it .
Parsing [sent. 378 len. 22]: In the third round the latter received another bad wound in the head , and the former had his under-lip divided .
Parsing [sent. 379 len. 21]: After that , the White Corps student gave many severe wounds , but got none of the consequence in return .
Parsing [sent. 380 len. 33]: At the end of five minutes from the beginning of the duel the surgeon stopped it ; the challenging party had suffered such injuries that any addition to them might be dangerous .
Parsing [sent. 381 len. 13]: These injuries were a fearful spectacle , but are better left undescribed .
Parsing [sent. 382 len. 11]: So , against expectation , my acquaintance was the victor .
Parsing [sent. 383 len. 17]: CHAPTER VI -LSB- A Sport that Sometimes Kills -RSB- The third duel was brief and bloody .
Parsing [sent. 384 len. 28]: The surgeon stopped it when he saw that one of the men had received such bad wounds that he could not fight longer without endangering his life .
Parsing [sent. 385 len. 39]: The fourth duel was a tremendous encounter ; but at the end of five or six minutes the surgeon interfered once more : another man so severely hurt as to render it unsafe to add to his harms .
Parsing [sent. 386 len. 57]: I watched this engagement as I watched the others -- with rapt interest and strong excitement , and with a shrink and a shudder for every blow that laid open a cheek or a forehead ; and a conscious paling of my face when I occasionally saw a wound of a yet more shocking nature inflicted .
Parsing [sent. 387 len. 40]: My eyes were upon the loser of this duel when he got his last and vanquishing wound -- it was in his face and it carried away his -- but no matter , I must not enter into details .
Parsing [sent. 388 len. 28]: I had but a glance , and then turned quickly , but I would not have been looking at all if I had known what was coming .
Parsing [sent. 389 len. 59]: No , that is probably not true ; one thinks he would not look if he knew what was coming , but the interest and the excitement are so powerful that they would doubtless conquer all other feelings ; and so , under the fierce exhilaration of the clashing steel , he would yield and look after all .
Parsing [sent. 390 len. 20]: Sometimes spectators of these duels faint -- and it does seem a very reasonable thing to do , too .
Parsing [sent. 391 len. 31]: Both parties to this fourth duel were badly hurt so much that the surgeon was at work upon them nearly or quite an hour -- a fact which is suggestive .
Parsing [sent. 392 len. 14]: But this waiting interval was not wasted in idleness by the assembled students .
Parsing [sent. 393 len. 45]: It was past noon , therefore they ordered their landlord , downstairs , to send up hot beefsteaks , chickens , and such things , and these they ate , sitting comfortable at the several tables , whilst they chatted , disputed and laughed .
Parsing [sent. 394 len. 38]: The door to the surgeon 's room stood open , meantime , but the cutting , sewing , splicing , and bandaging going on in there in plain view did not seem to disturb anyone 's appetite .
Parsing [sent. 395 len. 69]: I went in and saw the surgeon labor awhile , but could not enjoy ; it was much less trying to see the wounds given and received than to see them mended ; the stir and turmoil , and the music of the steel , were wanting here -- one 's nerves were wrung by this grisly spectacle , whilst the duel 's compensating pleasurable thrill was lacking .
Parsing [sent. 396 len. 21]: Finally the doctor finished , and the men who were to fight the closing battle of the day came forth .
Parsing [sent. 397 len. 31]: A good many dinners were not completed , yet , but no matter , they could be eaten cold , after the battle ; therefore everybody crowded forth to see .
Parsing [sent. 398 len. 14]: This was not a love duel , but a `` satisfaction '' affair .
Parsing [sent. 399 len. 13]: These two students had quarreled , and were here to settle it .
Parsing [sent. 400 len. 32]: They did not belong to any of the corps , but they were furnished with weapons and armor , and permitted to fight here by the five corps as a courtesy .
Parsing [sent. 401 len. 21]: Evidently these two young men were unfamiliar with the dueling ceremonies , though they were not unfamiliar with the sword .
Parsing [sent. 402 len. 37]: When they were placed in position they thought it was time to begin -- and then did begin , too , and with a most impetuous energy , without waiting for anybody to give the word .
Parsing [sent. 403 len. 21]: This vastly amused the spectators , and even broke down their studied and courtly gravity and surprised them into laughter .
Parsing [sent. 404 len. 15]: Of course the seconds struck up the swords and started the duel over again .
Parsing [sent. 405 len. 38]: At the word , the deluge of blows began , but before long the surgeon once more interfered -- for the only reason which ever permits him to interfere -- and the day 's war was over .
Parsing [sent. 406 len. 21]: It was now two in the afternoon , and I had been present since half past nine in the morning .
Parsing [sent. 407 len. 20]: The field of battle was indeed a red one by this time ; but some sawdust soon righted that .
Parsing [sent. 408 len. 9]: There had been one duel before I arrived .
Parsing [sent. 409 len. 19]: In it one of the men received many injuries , while the other one escaped without a scratch .
Parsing [sent. 410 len. 49]: I had seen the heads and faces of ten youths gashed in every direction by the keen two-edged blades , and yet had not seen a victim wince , nor heard a moan , or detected any fleeting expression which confessed the sharp pain the hurts were inflicting .
Parsing [sent. 411 len. 7]: This was good fortitude , indeed .
Parsing [sent. 412 len. 41]: Such endurance is to be expected in savages and prize-fighters , for they are born and educated to it ; but to find it in such perfection in these gently bred and kindly natured young fellows is matter for surprise .
Parsing [sent. 413 len. 37]: It was not merely under the excitement of the sword-play that this fortitude was shown ; it was shown in the surgeon 's room where an uninspiring quiet reigned , and where there was no audience .
Parsing [sent. 414 len. 11]: The doctor 's manipulations brought out neither grimaces nor moans .
Parsing [sent. 415 len. 35]: And in the fights it was observable that these lads hacked and slashed with the same tremendous spirit , after they were covered with streaming wounds , which they had shown in the beginning .
Parsing [sent. 416 len. 61]: The world in general looks upon the college duels as very farcical affairs : true , but considering that the college duel is fought by boys ; that the swords are real swords ; and that the head and face are exposed , it seems to me that it is a farce which had quite a grave side to it .
Parsing [sent. 417 len. 23]: People laugh at it mainly because they think the student is so covered up with armor that he can not be hurt .
Parsing [sent. 418 len. 24]: But it is not so ; his eyes and ears are protected , but the rest of his face and head are bare .
Parsing [sent. 419 len. 29]: He can not only be badly wounded , but his life is in danger ; and he would sometimes lose it but for the interference of the surgeon .
Parsing [sent. 420 len. 11]: It is not intended that his life shall be endangered .
Parsing [sent. 421 len. 7]: Fatal accidents are possible , however .
Parsing [sent. 422 len. 37]: For instance , the student 's sword may break , and the end of it fly up behind his antagonist 's ear and cut an artery which could not be reached if the sword remained whole .
Parsing [sent. 423 len. 14]: This has happened , sometimes , and death has resulted on the spot .
Parsing [sent. 424 len. 39]: Formerly the student 's armpits were not protected -- and at that time the swords were pointed , whereas they are blunt , now ; so an artery in the armpit was sometimes cut , and death followed .
Parsing [sent. 425 len. 41]: Then in the days of sharp-pointed swords , a spectator was an occasional victim -- the end of a broken sword flew five or ten feet and buried itself in his neck or his heart , and death ensued instantly .
Parsing [sent. 426 len. 57]: The student duels in Germany occasion two or three deaths every year , now , but this arises only from the carelessness of the wounded men ; they eat or drink imprudently , or commit excesses in the way of overexertion ; inflammation sets in and gets such a headway that it can not be arrested .
Parsing [sent. 427 len. 24]: Indeed , there is blood and pain and danger enough about the college duel to entitle it to a considerable degree of respect .
Parsing [sent. 428 len. 22]: All the customs , all the laws , all the details , pertaining to the student duel are quaint and naive .
Parsing [sent. 429 len. 24]: The grave , precise , and courtly ceremony with which the thing is conducted , invests it with a sort of antique charm .
Parsing [sent. 430 len. 14]: This dignity and these knightly graces suggest the tournament , not the prize-fight .
Parsing [sent. 431 len. 10]: The laws are as curious as they are strict .
Parsing [sent. 432 len. 26]: For instance , the duelist may step forward from the line he is placed upon , if he chooses , but never back of it .
Parsing [sent. 433 len. 38]: If he steps back of it , or even leans back , it is considered that he did it to avoid a blow or contrive an advantage ; so he is dismissed from his corps in disgrace .
Parsing [sent. 434 len. 28]: It would seem natural to step from under a descending sword unconsciously , and against one 's will and intent -- yet this unconsciousness is not allowed .
Parsing [sent. 435 len. 52]: Again : if under the sudden anguish of a wound the receiver of it makes a grimace , he falls some degrees in the estimation of his fellows ; his corps are ashamed of him : they call him `` hare foot , '' which is the German equivalent for chicken-hearted .
Parsing [sent. 436 len. 26]: CHAPTER VII -LSB- How Bismark Fought -RSB- In addition to the corps laws , there are some corps usages which have the force of laws .
Parsing [sent. 437 len. 77]: Perhaps the president of a corps notices that one of the membership who is no longer an exempt -- that is a freshman -- has remained a sophomore some little time without volunteering to fight ; some day , the president , instead of calling for volunteers , will APPOINT this sophomore to measure swords with a student of another corps ; he is free to decline -- everybody says so -- there is no compulsion .
Parsing [sent. 438 len. 57]: This is all true -- but I have not heard of any student who DID decline ; to decline and still remain in the corps would make him unpleasantly conspicuous , and properly so , since he knew , when he joined , that his main business , as a member , would be to fight .
Parsing [sent. 439 len. 25]: No , there is no law against declining -- except the law of custom , which is confessedly stronger than written law , everywhere .
Parsing [sent. 440 len. 52]: The ten men whose duels I had witnessed did not go away when their hurts were dressed , as I had supposed they would , but came back , one after another , as soon as they were free of the surgeon , and mingled with the assemblage in the dueling-room .
Parsing [sent. 441 len. 21]: The white-cap student who won the second fight witnessed the remaining three , and talked with us during the intermissions .
Parsing [sent. 442 len. 61]: He could not talk very well , because his opponent 's sword had cut his under-lip in two , and then the surgeon had sewed it together and overlaid it with a profusion of white plaster patches ; neither could he eat easily , still he contrived to accomplish a slow and troublesome luncheon while the last duel was preparing .
Parsing [sent. 443 len. 18]: The man who was the worst hurt of all played chess while waiting to see this engagement .
Parsing [sent. 444 len. 27]: A good part of his face was covered with patches and bandages , and all the rest of his head was covered and concealed by them .
Parsing [sent. 445 len. 44]: It is said that the student likes to appear on the street and in other public places in this kind of array , and that this predilection often keeps him out when exposure to rain or sun is a positive danger for him .
Parsing [sent. 446 len. 15]: Newly bandaged students are a very common spectacle in the public gardens of Heidelberg .
Parsing [sent. 447 len. 73]: It is also said that the student is glad to get wounds in the face , because the scars they leave will show so well there ; and it is also said that these face wounds are so prized that youths have even been known to pull them apart from time to time and put red wine in them to make them heal badly and leave as ugly a scar as possible .
Parsing [sent. 448 len. 44]: It does not look reasonable , but it is roundly asserted and maintained , nevertheless ; I am sure of one thing -- scars are plenty enough in Germany , among the young men ; and very grim ones they are , too .
Parsing [sent. 449 len. 15]: They crisscross the face in angry red welts , and are permanent and ineffaceable .
Parsing [sent. 450 len. 46]: Some of these scars are of a very strange and dreadful aspect ; and the effect is striking when several such accent the milder ones , which form a city map on a man 's face ; they suggest the `` burned district '' then .
Parsing [sent. 451 len. 21]: We had often noticed that many of the students wore a colored silk band or ribbon diagonally across their breasts .
Parsing [sent. 452 len. 36]: It transpired that this signifies that the wearer has fought three duels in which a decision was reached -- duels in which he either whipped or was whipped -- for drawn battles do not count .
Parsing [sent. 453 len. 59]: -LSB- 1 -RSB- After a student has received his ribbon , he is `` free '' ; he can cease from fighting , without reproach -- except some one insult him ; his president can not appoint him to fight ; he can volunteer if he wants to , or remain quiescent if he prefers to do so .
Parsing [sent. 454 len. 11]: Statistics show that he does NOT prefer to remain quiescent .
Parsing [sent. 455 len. 33]: They show that the duel has a singular fascination about it somewhere , for these free men , so far from resting upon the privilege of the badge , are always volunteering .
Parsing [sent. 456 len. 28]: A corps student told me it was of record that Prince Bismarck fought thirty-two of these duels in a single summer term when he was in college .
Parsing [sent. 457 len. 18]: So he fought twenty-nine after his badge had given him the right to retire from the field .
Parsing [sent. 458 len. 2]: 1 .
Parsing [sent. 459 len. 4]: FROM MY DIARY .
Parsing [sent. 460 len. 55]: -- Dined in a hotel a few miles up the Neckar , in a room whose walls were hung all over with framed portrait-groups of the Five Corps ; some were recent , but many antedated photography , and were pictured in lithography -- the dates ranged back to forty or fifty years ago .
Parsing [sent. 461 len. 10]: Nearly every individual wore the ribbon across his breast .
Parsing [sent. 462 len. 38]: In one portrait-group representing -LRB- as each of these pictures did -RRB- an entire Corps , I took pains to count the ribbons : there were twenty-seven members , and twenty-one of them wore that significant badge .
Parsing [sent. 463 len. 12]: The statistics may be found to possess interest in several particulars .
Parsing [sent. 464 len. 10]: Two days in every week are devoted to dueling .
Parsing [sent. 465 len. 28]: The rule is rigid that there must be three duels on each of these days ; there are generally more , but there can not be fewer .
Parsing [sent. 466 len. 16]: There were six the day I was present ; sometimes there are seven or eight .
Parsing [sent. 467 len. 46]: It is insisted that eight duels a week -- four for each of the two days -- is too low an average to draw a calculation from , but I will reckon from that basis , preferring an understatement to an overstatement of the case .
Parsing [sent. 468 len. 39]: This requires about four hundred and eighty or five hundred duelists a year -- for in summer the college term is about three and a half months , and in winter it is four months and sometimes longer .
Parsing [sent. 469 len. 64]: Of the seven hundred and fifty students in the university at the time I am writing of , only eighty belonged to the five corps , and it is only these corps that do the dueling ; occasionally other students borrow the arms and battleground of the five corps in order to settle a quarrel , but this does not happen every dueling-day .
Parsing [sent. 470 len. 19]: -LSB- 2 -RSB- Consequently eighty youths furnish the material for some two hundred and fifty duels a year .
Parsing [sent. 471 len. 13]: This average gives six fights a year to each of the eighty .
Parsing [sent. 472 len. 19]: This large work could not be accomplished if the badge-holders stood upon their privilege and ceased to volunteer .
Parsing [sent. 473 len. 2]: 2 .
Parsing [sent. 474 len. 16]: They have to borrow the arms because they could not get them elsewhere or otherwise .
Parsing [sent. 475 len. 30]: As I understand it , the public authorities , all over Germany , allow the five Corps to keep swords , but DO NOT ALLOW THEM TO USE THEM .
Parsing [sent. 476 len. 17]: This is law is rigid ; it is only the execution of it that is lax .
Parsing [sent. 477 len. 26]: Of course , where there is so much fighting , the students make it a point to keep themselves in constant practice with the foil .
Parsing [sent. 478 len. 91]: One often sees them , at the tables in the Castle grounds , using their whips or canes to illustrate some new sword trick which they have heard about ; and between the duels , on the day whose history I have been writing , the swords were not always idle ; every now and then we heard a succession of the keen hissing sounds which the sword makes when it is being put through its paces in the air , and this informed us that a student was practicing .
Parsing [sent. 479 len. 13]: Necessarily , this unceasing attention to the art develops an expert occasionally .
Parsing [sent. 480 len. 15]: He becomes famous in his own university , his renown spreads to other universities .
Parsing [sent. 481 len. 36]: He is invited to Goettingen , to fight with a Goettingen expert ; if he is victorious , he will be invited to other colleges , or those colleges will send their experts to him .
Parsing [sent. 482 len. 13]: Americans and Englishmen often join one or another of the five corps .
Parsing [sent. 483 len. 45]: A year or two ago , the principal Heidelberg expert was a big Kentuckian ; he was invited to the various universities and left a wake of victory behind him all about Germany ; but at last a little student in Strasburg defeated him .
Parsing [sent. 484 len. 28]: There was formerly a student in Heidelberg who had picked up somewhere and mastered a peculiar trick of cutting up under instead of cleaving down from above .
Parsing [sent. 485 len. 37]: While the trick lasted he won in sixteen successive duels in his university ; but by that time observers had discovered what his charm was , and how to break it , therefore his championship ceased .
Parsing [sent. 486 len. 14]: A rule which forbids social intercourse between members of different corps is strict .
Parsing [sent. 487 len. 29]: In the dueling-house , in the parks , on the street , and anywhere and everywhere that the students go , caps of a color group themselves together .
Parsing [sent. 488 len. 72]: If all the tables in a public garden were crowded but one , and that one had two red-cap students at it and ten vacant places , the yellow-caps , the blue-caps , the white caps , and the green caps , seeking seats , would go by that table and not seem to see it , nor seem to be aware that there was such a table in the grounds .
Parsing [sent. 489 len. 22]: The student by whose courtesy we had been enabled to visit the dueling-place , wore the white cap -- Prussian Corps .
Parsing [sent. 490 len. 15]: He introduced us to many white caps , but to none of another color .
Parsing [sent. 491 len. 48]: The corps etiquette extended even to us , who were strangers , and required us to group with the white corps only , and speak only with the white corps , while we were their guests , and keep aloof from the caps of the other colors .
Parsing [sent. 492 len. 54]: Once I wished to examine some of the swords , but an American student said , `` It would not be quite polite ; these now in the windows all have red hilts or blue ; they will bring in some with white hilts presently , and those you can handle freely . ''
Parsing [sent. 493 len. 38]: When a sword was broken in the first duel , I wanted a piece of it ; but its hilt was the wrong color , so it was considered best and politest to await a properer season .
Parsing [sent. 494 len. 41]: It was brought to me after the room was cleared , and I will now make a `` life-size '' sketch of it by tracing a line around it with my pen , to show the width of the weapon .
Parsing [sent. 495 len. 20]: -LSB- Figure 1 -RSB- The length of these swords is about three feet , and they are quite heavy .
Parsing [sent. 496 len. 31]: One 's disposition to cheer , during the course of the duels or at their close , was naturally strong , but corps etiquette forbade any demonstrations of this sort .
Parsing [sent. 497 len. 21]: However brilliant a contest or a victory might be , no sign or sound betrayed that any one was moved .
Parsing [sent. 498 len. 11]: A dignified gravity and repression were maintained at all times .
Parsing [sent. 499 len. 101]: When the dueling was finished and we were ready to go , the gentlemen of the Prussian Corps to whom we had been introduced took off their caps in the courteous German way , and also shook hands ; their brethren of the same order took off their caps and bowed , but without shaking hands ; the gentlemen of the other corps treated us just as they would have treated white caps -- they fell apart , apparently unconsciously , and left us an unobstructed pathway , but did not seem to see us or know we were there .
Parsing [sent. 500 len. 36]: If we had gone thither the following week as guests of another corps , the white caps , without meaning any offense , would have observed the etiquette of their order and ignored our presence .
Parsing [sent. 501 len. 12]: -LSB- How strangely are comedy and tragedy blended in this life !
Parsing [sent. 502 len. 53]: I had not been home a full half-hour , after witnessing those playful sham-duels , when circumstances made it necessary for me to get ready immediately to assist personally at a real one -- a duel with no effeminate limitation in the matter of results , but a battle to the death .
Parsing [sent. 503 len. 35]: An account of it , in the next chapter , will show the reader that duels between boys , for fun , and duels between men in earnest , are very different affairs . -RSB-

Parsing [sent. 551 len. 19]: Since it is always fought in the open air , the combatants are nearly sure to catch cold .
Parsing [sent. 552 len. 78]: M. Paul de Cassagnac , the most inveterate of the French duelists , had suffered so often in this way that he is at last a confirmed invalid ; and the best physician in Paris has expressed the opinion that if he goes on dueling for fifteen or twenty years more -- unless he forms the habit of fighting in a comfortable room where damps and draughts can not intrude -- he will eventually endanger his life .
Parsing [sent. 553 len. 33]: This ought to moderate the talk of those people who are so stubborn in maintaining that the French duel is the most health-giving of recreations because of the open-air exercise it affords .
Parsing [sent. 554 len. 23]: And it ought also to moderate that foolish talk about French duelists and socialist-hated monarchs being the only people who are immoral .
Parsing [sent. 555 len. 10]: But it is time to get at my subject .
Parsing [sent. 556 len. 28]: As soon as I heard of the late fiery outbreak between M. Gambetta and M. Fourtou in the French Assembly , I knew that trouble must follow .
Parsing [sent. 557 len. 23]: I knew it because a long personal friendship with M. Gambetta revealed to me the desperate and implacable nature of the man .
Parsing [sent. 558 len. 24]: Vast as are his physical proportions , I knew that the thirst for revenge would penetrate to the remotest frontiers of his person .
Parsing [sent. 559 len. 18]: I did not wait for him to call on me , but went at once to him .
Parsing [sent. 560 len. 17]: As I had expected , I found the brave fellow steeped in a profound French calm .
Parsing [sent. 561 len. 16]: I say French calm , because French calmness and English calmness have points of difference .
Parsing [sent. 562 len. 66]: He was moving swiftly back and forth among the debris of his furniture , now and then staving chance fragments of it across the room with his foot ; grinding a constant grist of curses through his set teeth ; and halting every little while to deposit another handful of his hair on the pile which he had been building of it on the table .
Parsing [sent. 563 len. 39]: He threw his arms around my neck , bent me over his stomach to his breast , kissed me on both cheeks , hugged me four or five times , and then placed me in his own arm-chair .
Parsing [sent. 564 len. 15]: As soon as I had got well again , we began business at once .
Parsing [sent. 565 len. 23]: I said I supposed he would wish me to act as his second , and he said , `` Of course . ''
Parsing [sent. 566 len. 31]: I said I must be allowed to act under a French name , so that I might be shielded from obloquy in my country , in case of fatal results .
Parsing [sent. 567 len. 18]: He winced here , probably at the suggestion that dueling was not regarded with respect in America .
Parsing [sent. 568 len. 8]: However , he agreed to my requirement .
Parsing [sent. 569 len. 20]: This accounts for the fact that in all the newspaper reports M. Gambetta 's second was apparently a Frenchman .
Parsing [sent. 570 len. 10]: First , we drew up my principal 's will .
Parsing [sent. 571 len. 11]: I insisted upon this , and stuck to my point .
Parsing [sent. 572 len. 25]: I said I had never heard of a man in his right mind going out to fight a duel without first making his will .
Parsing [sent. 573 len. 19]: He said he had never heard of a man in his right mind doing anything of the kind .
Parsing [sent. 574 len. 21]: When he had finished the will , he wished to proceed to a choice of his `` last words . ''
Parsing [sent. 575 len. 44]: He wanted to know how the following words , as a dying exclamation , struck me : `` I die for my God , for my country , for freedom of speech , for progress , and the universal brotherhood of man ! ''
Parsing [sent. 576 len. 32]: I objected that this would require too lingering a death ; it was a good speech for a consumptive , but not suited to the exigencies of the field of honor .
Parsing [sent. 577 len. 45]: We wrangled over a good many ante-mortem outbursts , but I finally got him to cut his obituary down to this , which he copied into his memorandum-book , purposing to get it by heart : `` I DIE THAT FRANCE MIGHT LIVE . ''
Parsing [sent. 578 len. 30]: I said that this remark seemed to lack relevancy ; but he said relevancy was a matter of no consequence in last words , what you wanted was thrill .
Parsing [sent. 579 len. 11]: The next thing in order was the choice of weapons .
Parsing [sent. 580 len. 24]: My principal said he was not feeling well , and would leave that and the other details of the proposed meeting to me .
Parsing [sent. 581 len. 51]: Therefore I wrote the following note and carried it to M. Fourtou 's friend : Sir : M. Gambetta accepts M. Fourtou 's challenge , and authorizes me to propose Plessis-Piquet as the place of meeting ; tomorrow morning at daybreak as the time ; and axes as the weapons .
Parsing [sent. 582 len. 12]: I am , sir , with great respect , Mark Twain .
Parsing [sent. 583 len. 11]: M. Fourtou 's friend read this note , and shuddered .
Parsing [sent. 584 len. 39]: Then he turned to me , and said , with a suggestion of severity in his tone : `` Have you considered , sir , what would be the inevitable result of such a meeting as this ? ''
Parsing [sent. 585 len. 12]: `` Well , for instance , what WOULD it be ? ''
Parsing [sent. 586 len. 4]: `` Bloodshed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 587 len. 13]: `` That 's about the size of it , '' I said .
Parsing [sent. 588 len. 19]: `` Now , if it is a fair question , what was your side proposing to shed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 589 len. 5]: I had him there .
Parsing [sent. 590 len. 16]: He saw he had made a blunder , so he hastened to explain it away .
Parsing [sent. 591 len. 7]: He said he had spoken jestingly .
Parsing [sent. 592 len. 35]: Then he added that he and his principal would enjoy axes , and indeed prefer them , but such weapons were barred by the French code , and so I must change my proposal .
Parsing [sent. 593 len. 39]: I walked the floor , turning the thing over in my mind , and finally it occurred to me that Gatling-guns at fifteen paces would be a likely way to get a verdict on the field of honor .
Parsing [sent. 594 len. 9]: So I framed this idea into a proposition .
Parsing [sent. 595 len. 6]: But it was not accepted .
Parsing [sent. 596 len. 8]: The code was in the way again .
Parsing [sent. 597 len. 14]: I proposed rifles ; then double-barreled shotguns ; then Colt 's navy revolvers .
Parsing [sent. 598 len. 19]: These being all rejected , I reflected awhile , and sarcastically suggested brickbats at three-quarters of a mile .
Parsing [sent. 599 len. 40]: I always hate to fool away a humorous thing on a person who has no perception of humor ; and it filled me with bitterness when this man went soberly away to submit the last proposition to his principal .
Parsing [sent. 600 len. 36]: He came back presently and said his principal was charmed with the idea of brickbats at three-quarters of a mile , but must decline on account of the danger to disinterested parties passing between them .
Parsing [sent. 601 len. 18]: Then I said : `` Well , I am at the end of my string , now .
Parsing [sent. 602 len. 11]: Perhaps YOU would be good enough to suggest a weapon ?
Parsing [sent. 603 len. 14]: Perhaps you have even had one in your mind all the time ? ''
Parsing [sent. 604 len. 19]: His countenance brightened , and he said with alacrity : `` Oh , without doubt , monsieur ! ''
Parsing [sent. 605 len. 37]: So he fell to hunting in his pockets -- pocket after pocket , and he had plenty of them -- muttering all the while , `` Now , what could I have done with them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 606 len. 6]: At last he was successful .
Parsing [sent. 607 len. 24]: He fished out of his vest pocket a couple of little things which I carried to the light and ascertained to be pistols .
Parsing [sent. 608 len. 12]: They were single-barreled and silver-mounted , and very dainty and pretty .
Parsing [sent. 609 len. 9]: I was not able to speak for emotion .
Parsing [sent. 610 len. 15]: I silently hung one of them on my watch-chain , and returned the other .
Parsing [sent. 611 len. 19]: My companion in crime now unrolled a postage-stamp containing several cartridges , and gave me one of them .
Parsing [sent. 612 len. 21]: I asked if he meant to signify by this that our men were to be allowed but one shot apiece .
Parsing [sent. 613 len. 10]: He replied that the French code permitted no more .
Parsing [sent. 614 len. 29]: I then begged him to go and suggest a distance , for my mind was growing weak and confused under the strain which had been put upon it .
Parsing [sent. 615 len. 5]: He named sixty-five yards .
Parsing [sent. 616 len. 6]: I nearly lost my patience .
Parsing [sent. 617 len. 11]: I said : `` Sixty-five yards , with these instruments ?
Parsing [sent. 618 len. 7]: Squirt-guns would be deadlier at fifty .
Parsing [sent. 619 len. 21]: Consider , my friend , you and I are banded together to destroy life , not make it eternal . ''
Parsing [sent. 620 len. 56]: But with all my persuasions , all my arguments , I was only able to get him to reduce the distance to thirty-five yards ; and even this concession he made with reluctance , and said with a sigh , `` I wash my hands of this slaughter ; on your head be it . ''
Parsing [sent. 621 len. 19]: There was nothing for me but to go home to my old lion-heart and tell my humiliating story .
Parsing [sent. 622 len. 17]: When I entered , M. Gambetta was laying his last lock of hair upon the altar .
Parsing [sent. 623 len. 23]: He sprang toward me , exclaiming : `` You have made the fatal arrangements -- I see it in your eye ! ''
Parsing [sent. 624 len. 5]: `` I have . ''
Parsing [sent. 625 len. 15]: His face paled a trifle , and he leaned upon the table for support .
Parsing [sent. 626 len. 29]: He breathed thick and heavily for a moment or two , so tumultuous were his feelings ; then he hoarsely whispered : `` The weapon , the weapon !
Parsing [sent. 627 len. 2]: Quick !
Parsing [sent. 628 len. 6]: what is the weapon ? ''
Parsing [sent. 629 len. 4]: `` This ! ''
Parsing [sent. 630 len. 7]: and I displayed that silver-mounted thing .
Parsing [sent. 631 len. 15]: He cast but one glance at it , then swooned ponderously to the floor .
Parsing [sent. 632 len. 25]: When he came to , he said mournfully : `` The unnatural calm to which I have subjected myself has told upon my nerves .
Parsing [sent. 633 len. 5]: But away with weakness !
Parsing [sent. 634 len. 13]: I will confront my fate like a man and a Frenchman . ''
Parsing [sent. 635 len. 28]: He rose to his feet , and assumed an attitude which for sublimity has never been approached by man , and has seldom been surpassed by statues .
Parsing [sent. 636 len. 28]: Then he said , in his deep bass tones : `` Behold , I am calm , I am ready ; reveal to me the distance . ''
Parsing [sent. 637 len. 5]: `` Thirty-five yards . ''
Parsing [sent. 638 len. 24]: ... I could not lift him up , of course ; but I rolled him over , and poured water down his back .
Parsing [sent. 639 len. 16]: He presently came to , and said : `` Thirty-five yards -- without a rest ?
Parsing [sent. 640 len. 4]: But why ask ?
Parsing [sent. 641 len. 16]: Since murder was that man 's intention , why should he palter with small details ?
Parsing [sent. 642 len. 22]: But mark you one thing : in my fall the world shall see how the chivalry of France meets death . ''
Parsing [sent. 643 len. 28]: After a long silence he asked : `` Was nothing said about that man 's family standing up with him , as an offset to my bulk ?
Parsing [sent. 644 len. 40]: But no matter ; I would not stoop to make such a suggestion ; if he is not noble enough to suggest it himself , he is welcome to this advantage , which no honorable man would take . ''
Parsing [sent. 645 len. 37]: He now sank into a sort of stupor of reflection , which lasted some minutes ; after which he broke silence with : `` The hour -- what is the hour fixed for the collision ? ''
Parsing [sent. 646 len. 6]: `` Dawn , tomorrow . ''
Parsing [sent. 647 len. 12]: He seemed greatly surprised , and immediately said : `` Insanity !
Parsing [sent. 648 len. 8]: I never heard of such a thing .
Parsing [sent. 649 len. 9]: Nobody is abroad at such an hour . ''
Parsing [sent. 650 len. 9]: `` That is the reason I named it .
Parsing [sent. 651 len. 11]: Do you mean to say you want an audience ? ''
Parsing [sent. 652 len. 9]: `` It is no time to bandy words .
Parsing [sent. 653 len. 16]: I am astonished that M. Fourtou should ever have agreed to so strange an innovation .
Parsing [sent. 654 len. 10]: Go at once and require a later hour . ''
Parsing [sent. 655 len. 22]: I ran downstairs , threw open the front door , and almost plunged into the arms of M. Fourtou 's second .
Parsing [sent. 656 len. 34]: He said : `` I have the honor to say that my principal strenuously objects to the hour chosen , and begs you will consent to change it to half past nine . ''
Parsing [sent. 657 len. 23]: `` Any courtesy , sir , which it is in our power to extend is at the service of your excellent principal .
Parsing [sent. 658 len. 10]: We agree to the proposed change of time . ''
Parsing [sent. 659 len. 13]: `` I beg you to accept the thanks of my client . ''
Parsing [sent. 660 len. 29]: Then he turned to a person behind him , and said , `` You hear , M. Noir , the hour is altered to half past nine . ''
Parsing [sent. 661 len. 13]: Whereupon M. Noir bowed , expressed his thanks , and went away .
Parsing [sent. 662 len. 29]: My accomplice continued : `` If agreeable to you , your chief surgeons and ours shall proceed to the field in the same carriage as is customary . ''
Parsing [sent. 663 len. 31]: `` It is entirely agreeable to me , and I am obliged to you for mentioning the surgeons , for I am afraid I should not have thought of them .
Parsing [sent. 664 len. 6]: How many shall I want ?
Parsing [sent. 665 len. 10]: I supposed two or three will be enough ? ''
Parsing [sent. 666 len. 10]: `` Two is the customary number for each party .
Parsing [sent. 667 len. 41]: I refer to ` chief ' surgeons ; but considering the exalted positions occupied by our clients , it will be well and decorous that each of us appoint several consulting surgeons , from among the highest in the profession .
Parsing [sent. 668 len. 9]: These will come in their own private carriages .
Parsing [sent. 669 len. 7]: Have you engaged a hearse ? ''
Parsing [sent. 670 len. 11]: `` Bless my stupidity , I never thought of it !
Parsing [sent. 671 len. 8]: I will attend to it right away .
Parsing [sent. 672 len. 32]: I must seem very ignorant to you ; but you must try to overlook that , because I have never had any experience of such a swell duel as this before .
Parsing [sent. 673 len. 25]: I have had a good deal to do with duels on the Pacific coast , but I see now that they were crude affairs .
Parsing [sent. 674 len. 5]: A hearse -- sho !
Parsing [sent. 675 len. 24]: we used to leave the elected lying around loose , and let anybody cord them up and cart them off that wanted to .
Parsing [sent. 676 len. 8]: Have you anything further to suggest ? ''
Parsing [sent. 677 len. 16]: `` Nothing , except that the head undertakers shall ride together , as is usual .
Parsing [sent. 678 len. 14]: The subordinates and mutes will go on foot , as is also usual .
Parsing [sent. 679 len. 22]: I will see you at eight o'clock in the morning , and we will then arrange the order of the procession .
Parsing [sent. 680 len. 12]: I have the honor to bid you a good day . ''
Parsing [sent. 681 len. 23]: I returned to my client , who said , `` Very well ; at what hour is the engagement to begin ? ''
Parsing [sent. 682 len. 6]: `` Half past nine . ''
Parsing [sent. 683 len. 5]: `` Very good indeed .
Parsing [sent. 684 len. 10]: Have you sent the fact to the newspapers ? ''
Parsing [sent. 685 len. 3]: `` SIR !
Parsing [sent. 686 len. 27]: If after our long and intimate friendship you can for a moment deem me capable of so base a treachery -- '' `` Tut , tut !
Parsing [sent. 687 len. 9]: What words are these , my dear friend ?
Parsing [sent. 688 len. 5]: Have I wounded you ?
Parsing [sent. 689 len. 12]: Ah , forgive me ; I am overloading you with labor .
Parsing [sent. 690 len. 16]: Therefore go on with the other details , and drop this one from your list .
Parsing [sent. 691 len. 11]: The bloody-minded Fourtou will be sure to attend to it .
Parsing [sent. 692 len. 49]: Or I myself -- yes , to make certain , I will drop a note to my journalistic friend , M. Noir -- '' `` Oh , come to think of it , you may save yourself the trouble ; that other second has informed M. Noir . ''
Parsing [sent. 693 len. 4]: `` H 'm !
Parsing [sent. 694 len. 6]: I might have known it .
Parsing [sent. 695 len. 16]: It is just like that Fourtou , who always wants to make a display . ''
Parsing [sent. 696 len. 140]: At half past nine in the morning the procession approached the field of Plessis-Piquet in the following order : first came our carriage -- nobody in it but M. Gambetta and myself ; then a carriage containing M. Fourtou and his second ; then a carriage containing two poet-orators who did not believe in God , and these had MS. funeral orations projecting from their breast pockets ; then a carriage containing the head surgeons and their cases of instruments ; then eight private carriages containing consulting surgeons ; then a hack containing a coroner ; then the two hearses ; then a carriage containing the head undertakers ; then a train of assistants and mutes on foot ; and after these came plodding through the fog a long procession of camp followers , police , and citizens generally .
Parsing [sent. 697 len. 20]: It was a noble turnout , and would have made a fine display if we had had thinner weather .
Parsing [sent. 698 len. 5]: There was no conversation .
Parsing [sent. 699 len. 38]: I spoke several times to my principal , but I judge he was not aware of it , for he always referred to his note-book and muttered absently , `` I die that France might live . ''
Parsing [sent. 700 len. 24]: Arrived on the field , my fellow-second and I paced off the thirty-five yards , and then drew lots for choice of position .
Parsing [sent. 701 len. 18]: This latter was but an ornamental ceremony , for all the choices were alike in such weather .
Parsing [sent. 702 len. 18]: These preliminaries being ended , I went to my principal and asked him if he was ready .
Parsing [sent. 703 len. 19]: He spread himself out to his full width , and said in a stern voice , `` Ready !
Parsing [sent. 704 len. 7]: Let the batteries be charged . ''
Parsing [sent. 705 len. 13]: The loading process was done in the presence of duly constituted witnesses .
Parsing [sent. 706 len. 25]: We considered it best to perform this delicate service with the assistance of a lantern , on account of the state of the weather .
Parsing [sent. 707 len. 6]: We now placed our men .
Parsing [sent. 708 len. 41]: At this point the police noticed that the public had massed themselves together on the right and left of the field ; they therefore begged a delay , while they should put these poor people in a place of safety .
Parsing [sent. 709 len. 5]: The request was granted .
Parsing [sent. 710 len. 20]: The police having ordered the two multitudes to take positions behind the duelists , we were once more ready .
Parsing [sent. 711 len. 40]: The weather growing still more opaque , it was agreed between myself and the other second that before giving the fatal signal we should each deliver a loud whoop to enable the combatants to ascertain each other 's whereabouts .
Parsing [sent. 712 len. 23]: I now returned to my principal , and was distressed to observe that he had lost a good deal of his spirit .
Parsing [sent. 713 len. 8]: I tried my best to hearten him .
Parsing [sent. 714 len. 17]: I said , `` Indeed , sir , things are not as bad as they seem .
Parsing [sent. 715 len. 56]: Considering the character of the weapons , the limited number of shots allowed , the generous distance , the impenetrable solidity of the fog , and the added fact that one of the combatants is one-eyed and the other cross-eyed and near-sighted , it seems to me that this conflict need not necessarily be fatal .
Parsing [sent. 716 len. 10]: There are chances that both of you may survive .
Parsing [sent. 717 len. 11]: Therefore , cheer up ; do not be downhearted . ''
Parsing [sent. 718 len. 30]: This speech had so good an effect that my principal immediately stretched forth his hand and said , `` I am myself again ; give me the weapon . ''
Parsing [sent. 719 len. 20]: I laid it , all lonely and forlorn , in the center of the vast solitude of his palm .
Parsing [sent. 720 len. 7]: He gazed at it and shuddered .
Parsing [sent. 721 len. 27]: And still mournfully contemplating it , he murmured in a broken voice : `` Alas , it is not death I dread , but mutilation . ''
Parsing [sent. 722 len. 21]: I heartened him once more , and with such success that he presently said , `` Let the tragedy begin .
Parsing [sent. 723 len. 18]: Stand at my back ; do not desert me in this solemn hour , my friend . ''
Parsing [sent. 724 len. 6]: I gave him my promise .
Parsing [sent. 725 len. 36]: I now assisted him to point his pistol toward the spot where I judged his adversary to be standing , and cautioned him to listen well and further guide himself by my fellow-second 's whoop .
Parsing [sent. 726 len. 18]: Then I propped myself against M. Gambetta 's back , and raised a rousing `` Whoop-ee ! ''
Parsing [sent. 727 len. 27]: This was answered from out the far distances of the fog , and I immediately shouted : `` One -- two -- three -- FIRE ! ''
Parsing [sent. 728 len. 6]: Two little sounds like SPIT !
Parsing [sent. 729 len. 2]: SPIT !
Parsing [sent. 730 len. 22]: broke upon my ear , and in the same instant I was crushed to the earth under a mountain of flesh .
Parsing [sent. 731 len. 39]: Bruised as I was , I was still able to catch a faint accent from above , to this effect : `` I die for ... for ... perdition take it , what IS it I die for ?
Parsing [sent. 732 len. 7]: ... oh , yes -- FRANCE !
Parsing [sent. 733 len. 8]: I die that France may live ! ''
Parsing [sent. 734 len. 39]: The surgeons swarmed around with their probes in their hands , and applied their microscopes to the whole area of M. Gambetta 's person , with the happy result of finding nothing in the nature of a wound .
Parsing [sent. 735 len. 13]: Then a scene ensued which was in every way gratifying and inspiriting .
Parsing [sent. 736 len. 58]: The two gladiators fell upon each other 's neck , with floods of proud and happy tears ; that other second embraced me ; the surgeons , the orators , the undertakers , the police , everybody embraced , everybody congratulated , everybody cried , and the whole atmosphere was filled with praise and with joy unspeakable .
Parsing [sent. 737 len. 23]: It seems to me then that I would rather be a hero of a French duel than a crowned and sceptered monarch .
Parsing [sent. 738 len. 41]: When the commotion had somewhat subsided , the body of surgeons held a consultation , and after a good deal of debate decided that with proper care and nursing there was reason to believe that I would survive my injuries .
Parsing [sent. 739 len. 66]: My internal hurts were deemed the most serious , since it was apparent that a broken rib had penetrated my left lung , and that many of my organs had been pressed out so far to one side or the other of where they belonged , that it was doubtful if they would ever learn to perform their functions in such remote and unaccustomed localities .
Parsing [sent. 740 len. 24]: They then set my left arm in two places , pulled my right hip into its socket again , and re-elevated my nose .
Parsing [sent. 741 len. 46]: I was an object of great interest , and even admiration ; and many sincere and warm-hearted persons had themselves introduced to me , and said they were proud to know the only man who had been hurt in a French duel in forty years .
Parsing [sent. 742 len. 41]: I was placed in an ambulance at the very head of the procession ; and thus with gratifying ` ECLAT I was marched into Paris , the most conspicuous figure in that great spectacle , and deposited at the hospital .
Parsing [sent. 743 len. 13]: The cross of the Legion of Honor has been conferred upon me .
Parsing [sent. 744 len. 7]: However , few escape that distinction .
Parsing [sent. 745 len. 15]: Such is the true version of the most memorable private conflict of the age .
Parsing [sent. 746 len. 10]: I have no complaints to make against any one .
Parsing [sent. 747 len. 12]: I acted for myself , and I can stand the consequences .
Parsing [sent. 748 len. 40]: Without boasting , I think I may say I am not afraid to stand before a modern French duelist , but as long as I keep in my right mind I will never consent to stand behind one again .

Parsing [sent. 750 len. 5]: It was a mistake .
Parsing [sent. 751 len. 39]: We sat in our seats three whole hours and never understood anything but the thunder and lightning ; and even that was reversed to suit German ideas , for the thunder came first and the lightning followed after .
Parsing [sent. 752 len. 8]: The behavior of the audience was perfect .
Parsing [sent. 753 len. 32]: There were no rustlings , or whisperings , or other little disturbances ; each act was listened to in silence , and the applauding was done after the curtain was down .
Parsing [sent. 754 len. 35]: The doors opened at half past four , the play began promptly at half past five , and within two minutes afterward all who were coming were in their seats , and quiet reigned .
Parsing [sent. 755 len. 27]: A German gentleman in the train had said that a Shakespearian play was an appreciated treat in Germany and that we should find the house filled .
Parsing [sent. 756 len. 43]: It was true ; all the six tiers were filled , and remained so to the end -- which suggested that it is not only balcony people who like Shakespeare in Germany , but those of the pit and gallery , too .
Parsing [sent. 757 len. 23]: Another time , we went to Mannheim and attended a shivaree -- otherwise an opera -- the one called `` Lohengrin . ''
Parsing [sent. 758 len. 13]: The banging and slamming and booming and crashing were something beyond belief .
Parsing [sent. 759 len. 26]: The racking and pitiless pain of it remains stored up in my memory alongside the memory of the time that I had my teeth fixed .
Parsing [sent. 760 len. 39]: There were circumstances which made it necessary for me to stay through the four hours to the end , and I stayed ; but the recollection of that long , dragging , relentless season of suffering is indestructible .
Parsing [sent. 761 len. 18]: To have to endure it in silence , and sitting still , made it all the harder .
Parsing [sent. 762 len. 39]: I was in a railed compartment with eight or ten strangers , of the two sexes , and this compelled repression ; yet at times the pain was so exquisite that I could hardly keep the tears back .
Parsing [sent. 763 len. 51]: At those times , as the howlings and wailings and shrieking of the singers , and the ragings and roarings and explosions of the vast orchestra rose higher and higher , and wilder and wilder , and fiercer and fiercer , I could have cried if I had been alone .
Parsing [sent. 764 len. 54]: Those strangers would not have been surprised to see a man do such a thing who was being gradually skinned , but they would have marveled at it here , and made remarks about it no doubt , whereas there was nothing in the present case which was an advantage over being skinned .
Parsing [sent. 765 len. 49]: There was a wait of half an hour at the end of the first act , and I could have gone out and rested during that time , but I could not trust myself to do it , for I felt that I should desert to stay out .
Parsing [sent. 766 len. 40]: There was another wait of half an hour toward nine o'clock , but I had gone through so much by that time that I had no spirit left , and so had no desire but to be let alone .
Parsing [sent. 767 len. 25]: I do not wish to suggest that the rest of the people there were like me , for , indeed , they were not .
Parsing [sent. 768 len. 46]: Whether it was that they naturally liked that noise , or whether it was that they had learned to like it by getting used to it , I did not at the time know ; but they did like it -- this was plain enough .
Parsing [sent. 769 len. 57]: While it was going on they sat and looked as rapt and grateful as cats do when one strokes their backs ; and whenever the curtain fell they rose to their feet , in one solid mighty multitude , and the air was snowed thick with waving handkerchiefs , and hurricanes of applause swept the place .
Parsing [sent. 770 len. 7]: This was not comprehensible to me .
Parsing [sent. 771 len. 33]: Of course , there were many people there who were not under compulsion to stay ; yet the tiers were as full at the close as they had been at the beginning .
Parsing [sent. 772 len. 8]: This showed that the people liked it .
Parsing [sent. 773 len. 9]: It was a curious sort of a play .
Parsing [sent. 774 len. 21]: In the manner of costumes and scenery it was fine and showy enough ; but there was not much action .
Parsing [sent. 775 len. 22]: That is to say , there was not much really done , it was only talked about ; and always violently .
Parsing [sent. 776 len. 10]: It was what one might call a narrative play .
Parsing [sent. 777 len. 24]: Everybody had a narrative and a grievance , and none were reasonable about it , but all in an offensive and ungovernable state .
Parsing [sent. 778 len. 71]: There was little of that sort of customary thing where the tenor and the soprano stand down by the footlights , warbling , with blended voices , and keep holding out their arms toward each other and drawing them back and spreading both hands over first one breast and then the other with a shake and a pressure -- no , it was every rioter for himself and no blending .
Parsing [sent. 779 len. 79]: Each sang his indictive narrative in turn , accompanied by the whole orchestra of sixty instruments , and when this had continued for some time , and one was hoping they might come to an understanding and modify the noise , a great chorus composed entirely of maniacs would suddenly break forth , and then during two minutes , and sometimes three , I lived over again all that I suffered the time the orphan asylum burned down .
Parsing [sent. 780 len. 30]: We only had one brief little season of heaven and heaven 's sweet ecstasy and peace during all this long and diligent and acrimonious reproduction of the other place .
Parsing [sent. 781 len. 24]: This was while a gorgeous procession of people marched around and around , in the third act , and sang the Wedding Chorus .
Parsing [sent. 782 len. 12]: To my untutored ear that was music -- almost divine music .
Parsing [sent. 783 len. 39]: While my seared soul was steeped in the healing balm of those gracious sounds , it seemed to me that I could almost resuffer the torments which had gone before , in order to be so healed again .
Parsing [sent. 784 len. 13]: There is where the deep ingenuity of the operatic idea is betrayed .
Parsing [sent. 785 len. 17]: It deals so largely in pain that its scattered delights are prodigiously augmented by the contrasts .
Parsing [sent. 786 len. 33]: A pretty air in an opera is prettier there than it could be anywhere else , I suppose , just as an honest man in politics shines more than he would elsewhere .
Parsing [sent. 787 len. 18]: I have since found out that there is nothing the Germans like so much as an opera .
Parsing [sent. 788 len. 18]: They like it , not in a mild and moderate way , but with their whole hearts .
Parsing [sent. 789 len. 10]: This is a legitimate result of habit and education .
Parsing [sent. 790 len. 16]: Our nation will like the opera , too , by and by , no doubt .
Parsing [sent. 791 len. 48]: One in fifty of those who attend our operas likes it already , perhaps , but I think a good many of the other forty-nine go in order to learn to like it , and the rest in order to be able to talk knowingly about it .
Parsing [sent. 792 len. 26]: The latter usually hum the airs while they are being sung , so that their neighbors may perceive that they have been to operas before .
Parsing [sent. 793 len. 10]: The funerals of these do not occur often enough .
Parsing [sent. 794 len. 25]: A gentle , old-maidish person and a sweet young girl of seventeen sat right in front of us that night at the Mannheim opera .
Parsing [sent. 795 len. 25]: These people talked , between the acts , and I understood them , though I understood nothing that was uttered on the distant stage .
Parsing [sent. 796 len. 68]: At first they were guarded in their talk , but after they had heard my agent and me conversing in English they dropped their reserve and I picked up many of their little confidences ; no , I mean many of HER little confidences -- meaning the elder party -- for the young girl only listened , and gave assenting nods , but never said a word .
Parsing [sent. 797 len. 11]: How pretty she was , and how sweet she was !
Parsing [sent. 798 len. 6]: I wished she would speak .
Parsing [sent. 799 len. 23]: But evidently she was absorbed in her own thoughts , her own young-girl dreams , and found a dearer pleasure in silence .
Parsing [sent. 800 len. 26]: But she was not dreaming sleepy dreams -- no , she was awake , alive , alert , she could not sit still a moment .
Parsing [sent. 801 len. 6]: She was an enchanting study .
Parsing [sent. 802 len. 89]: Her gown was of a soft white silky stuff that clung to her round young figure like a fish 's skin , and it was rippled over with the gracefulest little fringy films of lace ; she had deep , tender eyes , with long , curved lashes ; and she had peachy cheeks , and a dimpled chin , and such a dear little rosebud of a mouth ; and she was so dovelike , so pure , and so gracious , so sweet and so bewitching .
Parsing [sent. 803 len. 11]: For long hours I did mightily wish she would speak .
Parsing [sent. 804 len. 44]: And at last she did ; the red lips parted , and out leaps her thought -- and with such a guileless and pretty enthusiasm , too : `` Auntie , I just KNOW I 've got five hundred fleas on me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 805 len. 7]: That was probably over the average .
Parsing [sent. 806 len. 12]: Yes , it must have been very much over the average .
Parsing [sent. 807 len. 68]: The average at that time in the Grand Duchy of Baden was forty-five to a young person -LRB- when alone -RRB- , according to the official estimate of the home secretary for that year ; the average for older people was shifty and indeterminable , for whenever a wholesome young girl came into the presence of her elders she immediately lowered their average and raised her own .
Parsing [sent. 808 len. 7]: She became a sort of contribution-box .
Parsing [sent. 809 len. 17]: This dear young thing in the theater had been sitting there unconsciously taking up a collection .
Parsing [sent. 810 len. 18]: Many a skinny old being in our neighborhood was the happier and the restfuler for her coming .
Parsing [sent. 811 len. 15]: In that large audience , that night , there were eight very conspicuous people .
Parsing [sent. 812 len. 11]: These were ladies who had their hats or bonnets on .
Parsing [sent. 813 len. 22]: What a blessed thing it would be if a lady could make herself conspicuous in our theaters by wearing her hat .
Parsing [sent. 814 len. 85]: It is not usual in Europe to allow ladies and gentlemen to take bonnets , hats , overcoats , canes , or umbrellas into the auditorium , but in Mannheim this rule was not enforced because the audiences were largely made up of people from a distance , and among these were always a few timid ladies who were afraid that if they had to go into an anteroom to get their things when the play was over , they would miss their train .
Parsing [sent. 815 len. 48]: But the great mass of those who came from a distance always ran the risk and took the chances , preferring the loss of a train to a breach of good manners and the discomfort of being unpleasantly conspicuous during a stretch of three or four hours .
Parsing [sent. 816 len. 14]: CHAPTER X -LSB- How Wagner Operas Bang Along -RSB- Three or four hours .
Parsing [sent. 817 len. 34]: That is a long time to sit in one place , whether one be conspicuous or not , yet some of Wagner 's operas bang along for six whole hours on a stretch !
Parsing [sent. 818 len. 17]: But the people sit there and enjoy it all , and wish it would last longer .
Parsing [sent. 819 len. 63]: A German lady in Munich told me that a person could not like Wagner 's music at first , but must go through the deliberate process of learning to like it -- then he would have his sure reward ; for when he had learned to like it he would hunger for it and never be able to get enough of it .
Parsing [sent. 820 len. 14]: She said that six hours of Wagner was by no means too much .
Parsing [sent. 821 len. 22]: She said that this composer had made a complete revolution in music and was burying the old masters one by one .
Parsing [sent. 822 len. 44]: And she said that Wagner 's operas differed from all others in one notable respect , and that was that they were not merely spotted with music here and there , but were ALL music , from the first strain to the last .
Parsing [sent. 823 len. 4]: This surprised me .
Parsing [sent. 824 len. 22]: I said I had attended one of his insurrections , and found hardly ANY music in it except the Wedding Chorus .
Parsing [sent. 825 len. 43]: She said `` Lohengrin '' was noisier than Wagner 's other operas , but that if I would keep on going to see it I would find by and by that it was all music , and therefore would then enjoy it .
Parsing [sent. 826 len. 41]: I COULD have said , `` But would you advise a person to deliberately practice having a toothache in the pit of his stomach for a couple of years in order that he might then come to enjoy it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 827 len. 6]: But I reserved that remark .
Parsing [sent. 828 len. 49]: This lady was full of the praises of the head-tenor who had performed in a Wagner opera the night before , and went on to enlarge upon his old and prodigious fame , and how many honors had been lavished upon him by the princely houses of Germany .
Parsing [sent. 829 len. 5]: Here was another surprise .
Parsing [sent. 830 len. 22]: I had attended that very opera , in the person of my agent , and had made close and accurate observations .
Parsing [sent. 831 len. 39]: So I said : `` Why , madam , MY experience warrants me in stating that that tenor 's voice is not a voice at all , but only a shriek -- the shriek of a hyena . ''
Parsing [sent. 832 len. 40]: `` That is very true , '' she said ; `` he can not sing now ; it is already many years that he has lost his voice , but in other times he sang , yes , divinely !
Parsing [sent. 833 len. 21]: So whenever he comes now , you shall see , yes , that the theater will not hold the people .
Parsing [sent. 834 len. 4]: JAWOHL BEI GOTT !
Parsing [sent. 835 len. 10]: his voice is WUNDERSCHOEN in that past time . ''
Parsing [sent. 836 len. 18]: I said she was discovering to me a kindly trait in the Germans which was worth emulating .
Parsing [sent. 837 len. 38]: I said that over the water we were not quite so generous ; that with us , when a singer had lost his voice and a jumper had lost his legs , these parties ceased to draw .
Parsing [sent. 838 len. 47]: I said I had been to the opera in Hanover , once , and in Mannheim once , and in Munich -LRB- through my authorized agent -RRB- once , and this large experience had nearly persuaded me that the Germans PREFERRED singers who could n't sing .
Parsing [sent. 839 len. 54]: This was not such a very extravagant speech , either , for that burly Mannheim tenor 's praises had been the talk of all Heidelberg for a week before his performance took place -- yet his voice was like the distressing noise which a nail makes when you screech it across a window-pane .
Parsing [sent. 840 len. 39]: I said so to Heidelberg friends the next day , and they said , in the calmest and simplest way , that that was very true , but that in earlier times his voice HAD been wonderfully fine .
Parsing [sent. 841 len. 13]: And the tenor in Hanover was just another example of this sort .
Parsing [sent. 842 len. 20]: The English-speaking German gentleman who went with me to the opera there was brimming with enthusiasm over that tenor .
Parsing [sent. 843 len. 7]: He said : `` ACH GOTT !
Parsing [sent. 844 len. 4]: a great man !
Parsing [sent. 845 len. 5]: You shall see him .
Parsing [sent. 846 len. 20]: He is so celebrate in all Germany -- and he has a pension , yes , from the government .
Parsing [sent. 847 len. 28]: He not obliged to sing now , only twice every year ; but if he not sing twice each year they take him his pension away . ''
Parsing [sent. 848 len. 6]: Very well , we went .
Parsing [sent. 849 len. 23]: When the renowned old tenor appeared , I got a nudge and an excited whisper : `` Now you see him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 850 len. 12]: But the `` celebrate '' was an astonishing disappointment to me .
Parsing [sent. 851 len. 20]: If he had been behind a screen I should have supposed they were performing a surgical operation on him .
Parsing [sent. 852 len. 24]: I looked at my friend -- to my great surprise he seemed intoxicated with pleasure , his eyes were dancing with eager delight .
Parsing [sent. 853 len. 41]: When the curtain at last fell , he burst into the stormiest applause , and kept it up -- as did the whole house -- until the afflictive tenor had come three times before the curtain to make his bow .
Parsing [sent. 854 len. 37]: While the glowing enthusiast was swabbing the perspiration from his face , I said : `` I do n't mean the least harm , but really , now , do you think he can sing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 855 len. 3]: `` Him ?
Parsing [sent. 856 len. 2]: NO !
Parsing [sent. 857 len. 18]: GOTT IM HIMMEL , ABER , how he has been able to sing twenty-five years ago ? ''
Parsing [sent. 858 len. 5]: -LSB- Then pensively . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 859 len. 16]: `` ACH , no , NOW he not sing any more , he only cry .
Parsing [sent. 860 len. 27]: When he think he sing , now , he not sing at all , no , he only make like a cat which is unwell . ''
Parsing [sent. 861 len. 18]: Where and how did we get the idea that the Germans are a stolid , phlegmatic race ?
Parsing [sent. 862 len. 10]: In truth , they are widely removed from that .
Parsing [sent. 863 len. 29]: They are warm-hearted , emotional , impulsive , enthusiastic , their tears come at the mildest touch , and it is not hard to move them to laughter .
Parsing [sent. 864 len. 8]: They are the very children of impulse .
Parsing [sent. 865 len. 11]: We are cold and self-contained , compared to the Germans .
Parsing [sent. 866 len. 29]: They hug and kiss and cry and shout and dance and sing ; and where we use one loving , petting expression , they pour out a score .
Parsing [sent. 867 len. 45]: Their language is full of endearing diminutives ; nothing that they love escapes the application of a petting diminutive -- neither the house , nor the dog , nor the horse , nor the grandmother , nor any other creature , animate or inanimate .
Parsing [sent. 868 len. 17]: In the theaters at Hanover , Hamburg , and Mannheim , they had a wise custom .
Parsing [sent. 869 len. 18]: The moment the curtain went up , the light in the body of the house went down .
Parsing [sent. 870 len. 22]: The audience sat in the cool gloom of a deep twilight , which greatly enhanced the glowing splendors of the stage .
Parsing [sent. 871 len. 14]: It saved gas , too , and people were not sweated to death .
Parsing [sent. 872 len. 105]: When I saw `` King Lear '' played , nobody was allowed to see a scene shifted ; if there was nothing to be done but slide a forest out of the way and expose a temple beyond , one did not see that forest split itself in the middle and go shrieking away , with the accompanying disenchanting spectacle of the hands and heels of the impelling impulse -- no , the curtain was always dropped for an instant -- one heard not the least movement behind it -- but when it went up , the next instant , the forest was gone .
Parsing [sent. 873 len. 14]: Even when the stage was being entirely reset , one heard no noise .
Parsing [sent. 874 len. 23]: During the whole time that `` King Lear '' was playing the curtain was never down two minutes at any one time .
Parsing [sent. 875 len. 23]: The orchestra played until the curtain was ready to go up for the first time , then they departed for the evening .
Parsing [sent. 876 len. 15]: Where the stage waits never reach two minutes there is no occasion for music .
Parsing [sent. 877 len. 27]: I had never seen this two-minute business between acts but once before , and that was when the `` Shaughraun '' was played at Wallack 's .
Parsing [sent. 878 len. 67]: I was at a concert in Munich one night , the people were streaming in , the clock-hand pointed to seven , the music struck up , and instantly all movement in the body of the house ceased -- nobody was standing , or walking up the aisles , or fumbling with a seat , the stream of incomers had suddenly dried up at its source .
Parsing [sent. 879 len. 47]: I listened undisturbed to a piece of music that was fifteen minutes long -- always expecting some tardy ticket-holders to come crowding past my knees , and being continuously and pleasantly disappointed -- but when the last note was struck , here came the stream again .
Parsing [sent. 880 len. 26]: You see , they had made those late comers wait in the comfortable waiting-parlor from the time the music had begun until it was ended .
Parsing [sent. 881 len. 28]: It was the first time I had ever seen this sort of criminals denied the privilege of destroying the comfort of a house full of their betters .
Parsing [sent. 882 len. 56]: Some of these were pretty fine birds , but no matter , they had to tarry outside in the long parlor under the inspection of a double rank of liveried footmen and waiting-maids who supported the two walls with their backs and held the wraps and traps of their masters and mistresses on their arms .
Parsing [sent. 883 len. 36]: We had no footmen to hold our things , and it was not permissible to take them into the concert-room ; but there were some men and women to take charge of them for us .
Parsing [sent. 884 len. 19]: They gave us checks for them and charged a fixed price , payable in advance -- five cents .
Parsing [sent. 885 len. 33]: In Germany they always hear one thing at an opera which has never yet been heard in America , perhaps -- I mean the closing strain of a fine solo or duet .
Parsing [sent. 886 len. 11]: We always smash into it with an earthquake of applause .
Parsing [sent. 887 len. 34]: The result is that we rob ourselves of the sweetest part of the treat ; we get the whiskey , but we do n't get the sugar in the bottom of the glass .
Parsing [sent. 888 len. 30]: Our way of scattering applause along through an act seems to me to be better than the Mannheim way of saving it all up till the act is ended .
Parsing [sent. 889 len. 20]: I do not see how an actor can forget himself and portray hot passion before a cold still audience .
Parsing [sent. 890 len. 8]: I should think he would feel foolish .
Parsing [sent. 891 len. 45]: It is a pain to me to this day , to remember how that old German Lear raged and wept and howled around the stage , with never a response from that hushed house , never a single outburst till the act was ended .
Parsing [sent. 892 len. 25]: To me there was something unspeakably uncomfortable in the solemn dead silences that always followed this old person 's tremendous outpourings of his feelings .
Parsing [sent. 893 len. 128]: I could not help putting myself in his place -- I thought I knew how sick and flat he felt during those silences , because I remembered a case which came under my observation once , and which -- but I will tell the incident : One evening on board a Mississippi steamboat , a boy of ten years lay asleep in a berth -- a long , slim-legged boy , he was , encased in quite a short shirt ; it was the first time he had ever made a trip on a steamboat , and so he was troubled , and scared , and had gone to bed with his head filled with impending snaggings , and explosions , and conflagrations , and sudden death .
Parsing [sent. 894 len. 50]: About ten o'clock some twenty ladies were sitting around about the ladies ' saloon , quietly reading , sewing , embroidering , and so on , and among them sat a sweet , benignant old dame with round spectacles on her nose and her busy knitting-needles in her hands .
Parsing [sent. 895 len. 34]: Now all of a sudden , into the midst of this peaceful scene burst that slim-shanked boy in the brief shirt , wild-eyed , erect-haired , and shouting , `` Fire , fire !
Parsing [sent. 896 len. 18]: JUMP AND RUN , THE BOAT 'S AFIRE AND THERE AI N'T A MINUTE TO LOSE ! ''
Parsing [sent. 897 len. 39]: All those ladies looked sweetly up and smiled , nobody stirred , the old lady pulled her spectacles down , looked over them , and said , gently : `` But you must n't catch cold , child .
Parsing [sent. 898 len. 18]: Run and put on your breastpin , and then come and tell us all about it . ''
Parsing [sent. 899 len. 16]: It was a cruel chill to give to a poor little devil 's gushing vehemence .
Parsing [sent. 900 len. 37]: He was expecting to be a sort of hero -- the creator of a wild panic -- and here everybody sat and smiled a mocking smile , and an old woman made fun of his bugbear .
Parsing [sent. 901 len. 29]: I turned and crept away -- for I was that boy -- and never even cared to discover whether I had dreamed the fire or actually seen it .
Parsing [sent. 902 len. 40]: I am told that in a German concert or opera , they hardly ever encore a song ; that though they may be dying to hear it again , their good breeding usually preserves them against requiring the repetition .
Parsing [sent. 903 len. 36]: Kings may encore ; that is quite another matter ; it delights everybody to see that the King is pleased ; and as to the actor encored , his pride and gratification are simply boundless .
Parsing [sent. 904 len. 19]: Still , there are circumstances in which even a royal encore -- But it is better to illustrate .
Parsing [sent. 905 len. 37]: The King of Bavaria is a poet , and has a poet 's eccentricities -- with the advantage over all other poets of being able to gratify them , no matter what form they may take .
Parsing [sent. 906 len. 61]: He is fond of opera , but not fond of sitting in the presence of an audience ; therefore , it has sometimes occurred , in Munich , that when an opera has been concluded and the players were getting off their paint and finery , a command has come to them to get their paint and finery on again .
Parsing [sent. 907 len. 38]: Presently the King would arrive , solitary and alone , and the players would begin at the beginning and do the entire opera over again with only that one individual in the vast solemn theater for audience .
Parsing [sent. 908 len. 10]: Once he took an odd freak into his head .
Parsing [sent. 909 len. 58]: High up and out of sight , over the prodigious stage of the court theater is a maze of interlacing water-pipes , so pierced that in case of fire , innumerable little thread-like streams of water can be caused to descend ; and in case of need , this discharge can be augmented to a pouring flood .
Parsing [sent. 910 len. 11]: American managers might want to make a note of that .
Parsing [sent. 911 len. 6]: The King was sole audience .
Parsing [sent. 912 len. 37]: The opera proceeded , it was a piece with a storm in it ; the mimic thunder began to mutter , the mimic wind began to wail and sough , and the mimic rain to patter .
Parsing [sent. 913 len. 14]: The King 's interest rose higher and higher ; it developed into enthusiasm .
Parsing [sent. 914 len. 14]: He cried out : `` It is very , very good , indeed !
Parsing [sent. 915 len. 7]: But I will have real rain !
Parsing [sent. 916 len. 6]: Turn on the water ! ''
Parsing [sent. 917 len. 40]: The manager pleaded for a reversal of the command ; said it would ruin the costly scenery and the splendid costumes , but the King cried : `` No matter , no matter , I will have real rain !
Parsing [sent. 918 len. 6]: Turn on the water ! ''
Parsing [sent. 919 len. 25]: So the real rain was turned on and began to descend in gossamer lances to the mimic flower-beds and gravel walks of the stage .
Parsing [sent. 920 len. 17]: The richly dressed actresses and actors tripped about singing bravely and pretending not to mind it .
Parsing [sent. 921 len. 10]: The King was delighted -- his enthusiasm grew higher .
Parsing [sent. 922 len. 9]: He cried out : `` Bravo , bravo !
Parsing [sent. 923 len. 3]: More thunder !
Parsing [sent. 924 len. 3]: more lightning !
Parsing [sent. 925 len. 6]: turn on more rain ! ''
Parsing [sent. 926 len. 17]: The thunder boomed , the lightning glared , the storm-winds raged , the deluge poured down .
Parsing [sent. 927 len. 73]: The mimic royalty on the stage , with their soaked satins clinging to their bodies , slopped about ankle-deep in water , warbling their sweetest and best , the fiddlers under the eaves of the stage sawed away for dear life , with the cold overflow spouting down the backs of their necks , and the dry and happy King sat in his lofty box and wore his gloves to ribbons applauding .
Parsing [sent. 928 len. 5]: `` More yet ! ''
Parsing [sent. 929 len. 20]: cried the King ; `` more yet -- let loose all the thunder , turn on all the water !
Parsing [sent. 930 len. 11]: I will hang the man that raises an umbrella ! ''
Parsing [sent. 931 len. 27]: When this most tremendous and effective storm that had ever been produced in any theater was at last over , the King 's approbation was measureless .
Parsing [sent. 932 len. 8]: He cried : `` Magnificent , magnificent !
Parsing [sent. 933 len. 2]: ENCORE !
Parsing [sent. 934 len. 5]: Do it again ! ''
Parsing [sent. 935 len. 47]: But the manager succeeded in persuading him to recall the encore , and said the company would feel sufficiently rewarded and complimented in the mere fact that the encore was desired by his Majesty , without fatiguing him with a repetition to gratify their own vanity .
Parsing [sent. 936 len. 37]: During the remainder of the act the lucky performers were those whose parts required changes of dress ; the others were a soaked , bedraggled , and uncomfortable lot , but in the last degree picturesque .
Parsing [sent. 937 len. 39]: The stage scenery was ruined , trap-doors were so swollen that they would n't work for a week afterward , the fine costumes were spoiled , and no end of minor damages were done by that remarkable storm .
Parsing [sent. 938 len. 14]: It was a royal idea -- that storm -- and royally carried out .
Parsing [sent. 939 len. 16]: But observe the moderation of the King ; he did not insist upon his encore .
Parsing [sent. 940 len. 28]: If he had been a gladsome , unreflecting American opera-audience , he probably would have had his storm repeated and repeated until he drowned all those people .
Parsing [sent. 941 len. 18]: CHAPTER XI -LSB- I Paint a `` Turner '' -RSB- The summer days passed pleasantly in Heidelberg .
Parsing [sent. 942 len. 44]: We had a skilled trainer , and under his instructions we were getting our legs in the right condition for the contemplated pedestrian tours ; we were well satisfied with the progress which we had made in the German language , -LSB- 1 .
Parsing [sent. 943 len. 11]: See Appendix D for information concerning this fearful tongue . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 944 len. 12]: and more than satisfied with what we had accomplished in art .
Parsing [sent. 945 len. 24]: We had had the best instructors in drawing and painting in Germany -- Haemmerling , Vogel , Mueller , Dietz , and Schumann .
Parsing [sent. 946 len. 5]: Haemmerling taught us landscape-painting .
Parsing [sent. 947 len. 29]: Vogel taught us figure-drawing , Mueller taught us to do still-life , and Dietz and Schumann gave us a finishing course in two specialties -- battle-pieces and shipwrecks .
Parsing [sent. 948 len. 11]: Whatever I am in Art I owe to these men .
Parsing [sent. 949 len. 33]: I have something of the manner of each and all of them ; but they all said that I had also a manner of my own , and that it was conspicuous .
Parsing [sent. 950 len. 53]: They said there was a marked individuality about my style -- insomuch that if I ever painted the commonest type of a dog , I should be sure to throw a something into the aspect of that dog which would keep him from being mistaken for the creation of any other artist .
Parsing [sent. 951 len. 35]: Secretly I wanted to believe all these kind sayings , but I could not ; I was afraid that my masters ' partiality for me , and pride in me , biased their judgment .
Parsing [sent. 952 len. 8]: So I resolved to make a test .
Parsing [sent. 953 len. 53]: Privately , and unknown to any one , I painted my great picture , `` Heidelberg Castle Illuminated '' -- my first really important work in oils -- and had it hung up in the midst of a wilderness of oil-pictures in the Art Exhibition , with no name attached to it .
Parsing [sent. 954 len. 11]: To my great gratification it was instantly recognized as mine .
Parsing [sent. 955 len. 19]: All the town flocked to see it , and people even came from neighboring localities to visit it .
Parsing [sent. 956 len. 12]: It made more stir than any other work in the Exhibition .
Parsing [sent. 957 len. 53]: But the most gratifying thing of all was , that chance strangers , passing through , who had not heard of my picture , were not only drawn to it , as by a lodestone , the moment they entered the gallery , but always took it for a `` Turner . ''
Parsing [sent. 958 len. 7]: Apparently nobody had ever done that .
Parsing [sent. 959 len. 41]: There were ruined castles on the overhanging cliffs and crags all the way ; these were said to have their legends , like those on the Rhine , and what was better still , they had never been in print .
Parsing [sent. 960 len. 28]: There was nothing in the books about that lovely region ; it had been neglected by the tourist , it was virgin soil for the literary pioneer .
Parsing [sent. 961 len. 23]: Meantime the knapsacks , the rough walking-suits and the stout walking-shoes which we had ordered , were finished and brought to us .
Parsing [sent. 962 len. 15]: A Mr. X and a young Mr. Z had agreed to go with us .
Parsing [sent. 963 len. 23]: We went around one evening and bade good-by to our friends , and afterward had a little farewell banquet at the hotel .
Parsing [sent. 964 len. 27]: We got to bed early , for we wanted to make an early start , so as to take advantage of the cool of the morning .
Parsing [sent. 965 len. 37]: We were out of bed at break of day , feeling fresh and vigorous , and took a hearty breakfast , then plunged down through the leafy arcades of the Castle grounds , toward the town .
Parsing [sent. 966 len. 25]: What a glorious summer morning it was , and how the flowers did pour out their fragrance , and how the birds did sing !
Parsing [sent. 967 len. 14]: It was just the time for a tramp through the woods and mountains .
Parsing [sent. 968 len. 42]: We were all dressed alike : broad slouch hats , to keep the sun off ; gray knapsacks ; blue army shirts ; blue overalls ; leathern gaiters buttoned tight from knee down to ankle ; high-quarter coarse shoes snugly laced .
Parsing [sent. 969 len. 32]: Each man had an opera-glass , a canteen , and a guide-book case slung over his shoulder , and carried an alpenstock in one hand and a sun-umbrella in the other .
Parsing [sent. 970 len. 36]: Around our hats were wound many folds of soft white muslin , with the ends hanging and flapping down our backs -- an idea brought from the Orient and used by tourists all over Europe .
Parsing [sent. 971 len. 31]: Harris carried the little watch-like machine called a `` pedometer , '' whose office is to keep count of a man 's steps and tell how far he has walked .
Parsing [sent. 972 len. 18]: Everybody stopped to admire our costumes and give us a hearty `` Pleasant march to you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 973 len. 19]: When we got downtown I found that we could go by rail to within five miles of Heilbronn .
Parsing [sent. 974 len. 18]: The train was just starting , so we jumped aboard and went tearing away in splendid spirits .
Parsing [sent. 975 len. 38]: It was agreed all around that we had done wisely , because it would be just as enjoyable to walk DOWN the Neckar as up it , and it could not be needful to walk both ways .
Parsing [sent. 976 len. 10]: There were some nice German people in our compartment .
Parsing [sent. 977 len. 34]: I got to talking some pretty private matters presently , and Harris became nervous ; so he nudged me and said : `` Speak in German -- these Germans may understand English . ''
Parsing [sent. 978 len. 30]: I did so , it was well I did ; for it turned out that there was not a German in that party who did not understand English perfectly .
Parsing [sent. 979 len. 11]: It is curious how widespread our language is in Germany .
Parsing [sent. 980 len. 21]: After a while some of those folks got out and a German gentleman and his two young daughters got in .
Parsing [sent. 981 len. 16]: I spoke in German of one of the latter several times , but without result .
Parsing [sent. 982 len. 20]: Finally she said : `` ICH VERSTEHE NUR DEUTCH UND ENGLISHE , '' -- or words to that effect .
Parsing [sent. 983 len. 16]: That is , `` I do n't understand any language but German and English . ''
Parsing [sent. 984 len. 15]: And sure enough , not only she but her father and sister spoke English .
Parsing [sent. 985 len. 24]: So after that we had all the talk we wanted ; and we wanted a good deal , for they were agreeable people .
Parsing [sent. 986 len. 20]: They were greatly interested in our customs ; especially the alpenstocks , for they had not seen any before .
Parsing [sent. 987 len. 40]: They said that the Neckar road was perfectly level , so we must be going to Switzerland or some other rugged country ; and asked us if we did not find the walking pretty fatiguing in such warm weather .
Parsing [sent. 988 len. 5]: But we said no .
Parsing [sent. 989 len. 44]: We reached Wimpfen -- I think it was Wimpfen -- in about three hours , and got out , not the least tired ; found a good hotel and ordered beer and dinner -- then took a stroll through the venerable old village .
Parsing [sent. 990 len. 12]: It was very picturesque and tumble-down , and dirty and interesting .
Parsing [sent. 991 len. 28]: It had queer houses five hundred years old in it , and a military tower 115 feet high , which had stood there more than ten centuries .
Parsing [sent. 992 len. 8]: I made a little sketch of it .
Parsing [sent. 993 len. 13]: I kept a copy , but gave the original to the Burgomaster .
Parsing [sent. 994 len. 29]: I think the original was better than the copy , because it had more windows in it and the grass stood up better and had a brisker look .
Parsing [sent. 995 len. 29]: There was none around the tower , though ; I composed the grass myself , from studies I made in a field by Heidelberg in Haemmerling 's time .
Parsing [sent. 996 len. 27]: The man on top , looking at the view , is apparently too large , but I found he could not be made smaller , conveniently .
Parsing [sent. 997 len. 56]: I wanted him there , and I wanted him visible , so I thought out a way to manage it ; I composed the picture from two points of view ; the spectator is to observe the man from bout where that flag is , and he must observe the tower itself from the ground .
Parsing [sent. 998 len. 6]: This harmonizes the seeming discrepancy .
Parsing [sent. 999 len. 29]: -LSB- Figure 2 -RSB- Near an old cathedral , under a shed , were three crosses of stone -- moldy and damaged things , bearing life-size stone figures .
Parsing [sent. 1000 len. 34]: The two thieves were dressed in the fanciful court costumes of the middle of the sixteenth century , while the Saviour was nude , with the exception of a cloth around the loins .
Parsing [sent. 1001 len. 30]: We had dinner under the green trees in a garden belonging to the hotel and overlooking the Neckar ; then , after a smoke , we went to bed .
Parsing [sent. 1002 len. 20]: We had a refreshing nap , then got up about three in the afternoon and put on our panoply .
Parsing [sent. 1003 len. 45]: As we tramped gaily out at the gate of the town , we overtook a peasant 's cart , partly laden with odds and ends of cabbages and similar vegetable rubbish , and drawn by a small cow and a smaller donkey yoked together .
Parsing [sent. 1004 len. 25]: It was a pretty slow concern , but it got us into Heilbronn before dark -- five miles , or possibly it was seven .
Parsing [sent. 1005 len. 44]: We stopped at the very same inn which the famous old robber-knight and rough fighter Goetz von Berlichingen , abode in after he got out of captivity in the Square Tower of Heilbronn between three hundred and fifty and four hundred years ago .
Parsing [sent. 1006 len. 24]: Harris and I occupied the same room which he had occupied and the same paper had not quite peeled off the walls yet .
Parsing [sent. 1007 len. 24]: The furniture was quaint old carved stuff , full four hundred years old , and some of the smells were over a thousand .
Parsing [sent. 1008 len. 33]: There was a hook in the wall , which the landlord said the terrific old Goetz used to hang his iron hand on when he took it off to go to bed .
Parsing [sent. 1009 len. 59]: This room was very large -- it might be called immense -- and it was on the first floor ; which means it was in the second story , for in Europe the houses are so high that they do not count the first story , else they would get tired climbing before they got to the top .
Parsing [sent. 1010 len. 26]: The wallpaper was a fiery red , with huge gold figures in it , well smirched by time , and it covered all the doors .
Parsing [sent. 1011 len. 34]: These doors fitted so snugly and continued the figures of the paper so unbrokenly , that when they were closed one had to go feeling and searching along the wall to find them .
Parsing [sent. 1012 len. 39]: There was a stove in the corner -- one of those tall , square , stately white porcelain things that looks like a monument and keeps you thinking of death when you ought to be enjoying your travels .
Parsing [sent. 1013 len. 28]: The windows looked out on a little alley , and over that into a stable and some poultry and pig yards in the rear of some tenement-houses .
Parsing [sent. 1014 len. 30]: There were the customary two beds in the room , one in one end , the other in the other , about an old-fashioned brass-mounted , single-barreled pistol-shot apart .
Parsing [sent. 1015 len. 38]: They were fully as narrow as the usual German bed , too , and had the German bed 's ineradicable habit of spilling the blankets on the floor every time you forgot yourself and went to sleep .
Parsing [sent. 1016 len. 46]: A round table as large as King Arthur 's stood in the center of the room ; while the waiters were getting ready to serve our dinner on it we all went out to see the renowned clock on the front of the municipal buildings .
Parsing [sent. 1017 len. 25]: CHAPTER XII -LSB- What the Wives Saved -RSB- The RATHHAUS , or municipal building , is of the quaintest and most picturesque Middle-Age architecture .
Parsing [sent. 1018 len. 25]: It has a massive portico and steps , before it , heavily balustraded , and adorned with life-sized rusty iron knights in complete armor .
Parsing [sent. 1019 len. 16]: The clock-face on the front of the building is very large and of curious pattern .
Parsing [sent. 1020 len. 96]: Ordinarily , a gilded angel strikes the hour on a big bell with a hammer ; as the striking ceases , a life-sized figure of Time raises its hour-glass and turns it ; two golden rams advance and butt each other ; a gilded cock lifts its wings ; but the main features are two great angels , who stand on each side of the dial with long horns at their lips ; it was said that they blew melodious blasts on these horns every hour -- but they did not do it for us .
Parsing [sent. 1021 len. 19]: We were told , later , that they blew only at night , when the town was still .
Parsing [sent. 1022 len. 40]: Within the RATHHAUS were a number of huge wild boars ' heads , preserved , and mounted on brackets along the wall ; they bore inscriptions telling who killed them and how many hundred years ago it was done .
Parsing [sent. 1023 len. 14]: One room in the building was devoted to the preservation of ancient archives .
Parsing [sent. 1024 len. 49]: There they showed us no end of aged documents ; some were signed by Popes , some by Tilly and other great generals , and one was a letter written and subscribed by Goetz von Berlichingen in Heilbronn in 1519 just after his release from the Square Tower .
Parsing [sent. 1025 len. 36]: This fine old robber-knight was a devoutly and sincerely religious man , hospitable , charitable to the poor , fearless in fight , active , enterprising , and possessed of a large and generous nature .
Parsing [sent. 1026 len. 35]: He had in him a quality of being able to overlook moderate injuries , and being able to forgive and forget mortal ones as soon as he had soundly trounced the authors of them .
Parsing [sent. 1027 len. 19]: He was prompt to take up any poor devil 's quarrel and risk his neck to right him .
Parsing [sent. 1028 len. 18]: The common folk held him dear , and his memory is still green in ballad and tradition .
Parsing [sent. 1029 len. 36]: He used to go on the highway and rob rich wayfarers ; and other times he would swoop down from his high castle on the hills of the Neckar and capture passing cargoes of merchandise .
Parsing [sent. 1030 len. 36]: In his memoirs he piously thanks the Giver of all Good for remembering him in his needs and delivering sundry such cargoes into his hands at times when only special providences could have relieved him .
Parsing [sent. 1031 len. 13]: He was a doughty warrior and found a deep joy in battle .
Parsing [sent. 1032 len. 41]: In an assault upon a stronghold in Bavaria when he was only twenty-three years old , his right hand was shot away , but he was so interested in the fight that he did not observe it for a while .
Parsing [sent. 1033 len. 37]: He said that the iron hand which was made for him afterward , and which he wore for more than half a century , was nearly as clever a member as the fleshy one had been .
Parsing [sent. 1034 len. 28]: I was glad to get a facsimile of the letter written by this fine old German Robin Hood , though I was not able to read it .
Parsing [sent. 1035 len. 13]: He was a better artist with his sword than with his pen .
Parsing [sent. 1036 len. 12]: We went down by the river and saw the Square Tower .
Parsing [sent. 1037 len. 14]: It was a very venerable structure , very strong , and very ornamental .
Parsing [sent. 1038 len. 8]: There was no opening near the ground .
Parsing [sent. 1039 len. 14]: They had to use a ladder to get into it , no doubt .
Parsing [sent. 1040 len. 25]: We visited the principal church , also -- a curious old structure , with a towerlike spire adorned with all sorts of grotesque images .
Parsing [sent. 1041 len. 53]: The inner walls of the church were placarded with large mural tablets of copper , bearing engraved inscriptions celebrating the merits of old Heilbronn worthies of two or three centuries ago , and also bearing rudely painted effigies of themselves and their families tricked out in the queer costumes of those days .
Parsing [sent. 1042 len. 40]: The head of the family sat in the foreground , and beyond him extended a sharply receding and diminishing row of sons ; facing him sat his wife , and beyond her extended a low row of diminishing daughters .
Parsing [sent. 1043 len. 11]: The family was usually large , but the perspective bad .
Parsing [sent. 1044 len. 38]: Then we hired the hack and the horse which Goetz von Berlichingen used to use , and drove several miles into the country to visit the place called WEIBERTREU -- Wife 's Fidelity I suppose it means .
Parsing [sent. 1045 len. 10]: It was a feudal castle of the Middle Ages .
Parsing [sent. 1046 len. 34]: When we reached its neighborhood we found it was beautifully situated , but on top of a mound , or hill , round and tolerably steep , and about two hundred feet high .
Parsing [sent. 1047 len. 40]: Therefore , as the sun was blazing hot , we did not climb up there , but took the place on trust , and observed it from a distance while the horse leaned up against a fence and rested .
Parsing [sent. 1048 len. 62]: The place has no interest except that which is lent it by its legend , which is a very pretty one -- to this effect : THE LEGEND In the Middle Ages , a couple of young dukes , brothers , took opposite sides in one of the wars , the one fighting for the Emperor , the other against him .
Parsing [sent. 1049 len. 37]: One of them owned the castle and village on top of the mound which I have been speaking of , and in his absence his brother came with his knights and soldiers and began a siege .
Parsing [sent. 1050 len. 18]: It was a long and tedious business , for the people made a stubborn and faithful defense .
Parsing [sent. 1051 len. 25]: But at last their supplies ran out and starvation began its work ; more fell by hunger than by the missiles of the enemy .
Parsing [sent. 1052 len. 12]: They by and by surrendered , and begged for charitable terms .
Parsing [sent. 1053 len. 43]: But the beleaguering prince was so incensed against them for their long resistance that he said he would spare none but the women and children -- all men should be put to the sword without exception , and all their goods destroyed .
Parsing [sent. 1054 len. 18]: Then the women came and fell on their knees and begged for the lives of their husbands .
Parsing [sent. 1055 len. 69]: `` No , '' said the prince , `` not a man of them shall escape alive ; you yourselves shall go with your children into houseless and friendless banishment ; but that you may not starve I grant you this one grace , that each woman may bear with her from this place as much of her most valuable property as she is able to carry . ''
Parsing [sent. 1056 len. 20]: Very well , presently the gates swung open and out filed those women carrying their HUSBANDS on their shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 1057 len. 39]: The besiegers , furious at the trick , rushed forward to slaughter the men , but the Duke stepped between and said : `` No , put up your swords -- a prince 's word is inviolable . ''
Parsing [sent. 1058 len. 48]: When we got back to the hotel , King Arthur 's Round Table was ready for us in its white drapery , and the head waiter and his first assistant , in swallow-tails and white cravats , brought in the soup and the hot plates at once .
Parsing [sent. 1059 len. 53]: Mr. X had ordered the dinner , and when the wine came on , he picked up a bottle , glanced at the label , and then turned to the grave , the melancholy , the sepulchral head waiter and said it was not the sort of wine he had asked for .
Parsing [sent. 1060 len. 26]: The head waiter picked up the bottle , cast his undertaker-eye on it and said : `` It is true ; I beg pardon . ''
Parsing [sent. 1061 len. 16]: Then he turned on his subordinate and calmly said , `` Bring another label . ''
Parsing [sent. 1062 len. 31]: At the same time he slid the present label off with his hand and laid it aside ; it had been newly put on , its paste was still wet .
Parsing [sent. 1063 len. 53]: When the new label came , he put it on ; our French wine being now turned into German wine , according to desire , the head waiter went blandly about his other duties , as if the working of this sort of miracle was a common and easy thing to him .
Parsing [sent. 1064 len. 67]: Mr. X said he had not known , before , that there were people honest enough to do this miracle in public , but he was aware that thousands upon thousands of labels were imported into America from Europe every year , to enable dealers to furnish to their customers in a quiet and inexpensive way all the different kinds of foreign wines they might require .
Parsing [sent. 1065 len. 28]: We took a turn around the town , after dinner , and found it fully as interesting in the moonlight as it had been in the daytime .
Parsing [sent. 1066 len. 19]: The streets were narrow and roughly paved , and there was not a sidewalk or a street-lamp anywhere .
Parsing [sent. 1067 len. 12]: The dwellings were centuries old , and vast enough for hotels .
Parsing [sent. 1068 len. 53]: They widened all the way up ; the stories projected further and further forward and aside as they ascended , and the long rows of lighted windows , filled with little bits of panes , curtained with figured white muslin and adorned outside with boxes of flowers , made a pretty effect .
Parsing [sent. 1069 len. 60]: The moon was bright , and the light and shadow very strong ; and nothing could be more picturesque than those curving streets , with their rows of huge high gables leaning far over toward each other in a friendly gossiping way , and the crowds below drifting through the alternating blots of gloom and mellow bars of moonlight .
Parsing [sent. 1070 len. 21]: Nearly everybody was abroad , chatting , singing , romping , or massed in lazy comfortable attitudes in the doorways .
Parsing [sent. 1071 len. 32]: In one place there was a public building which was fenced about with a thick , rusty chain , which sagged from post to post in a succession of low swings .
Parsing [sent. 1072 len. 13]: The pavement , here , was made of heavy blocks of stone .
Parsing [sent. 1073 len. 23]: In the glare of the moon a party of barefooted children were swinging on those chains and having a noisy good time .
Parsing [sent. 1074 len. 27]: They were not the first ones who have done that ; even their great-great-grandfathers had not been the first to do it when they were children .
Parsing [sent. 1075 len. 28]: The strokes of the bare feet had worn grooves inches deep in the stone flags ; it had taken many generations of swinging children to accomplish that .
Parsing [sent. 1076 len. 47]: Everywhere in the town were the mold and decay that go with antiquity , and evidence of it ; but I do not know that anything else gave us so vivid a sense of the old age of Heilbronn as those footworn grooves in the paving-stones .
Parsing [sent. 1077 len. 47]: CHAPTER XIII -LSB- My Long Crawl in the Dark -RSB- When we got back to the hotel I wound and set the pedometer and put it in my pocket , for I was to carry it next day and keep record of the miles we made .
Parsing [sent. 1078 len. 23]: The work which we had given the instrument to do during the day which had just closed had not fatigued it perceptibly .
Parsing [sent. 1079 len. 23]: We were in bed by ten , for we wanted to be up and away on our tramp homeward with the dawn .
Parsing [sent. 1080 len. 12]: I hung fire , but Harris went to sleep at once .
Parsing [sent. 1081 len. 43]: I hate a man who goes to sleep at once ; there is a sort of indefinable something about it which is not exactly an insult , and yet is an insolence ; and one which is hard to bear , too .
Parsing [sent. 1082 len. 27]: I lay there fretting over this injury , and trying to go to sleep ; but the harder I tried , the wider awake I grew .
Parsing [sent. 1083 len. 18]: I got to feeling very lonely in the dark , with no company but an undigested dinner .
Parsing [sent. 1084 len. 51]: My mind got a start by and by , and began to consider the beginning of every subject which has ever been thought of ; but it never went further than the beginning ; it was touch and go ; it fled from topic to topic with a frantic speed .
Parsing [sent. 1085 len. 22]: At the end of an hour my head was in a perfect whirl and I was dead tired , fagged out .
Parsing [sent. 1086 len. 64]: The fatigue was so great that it presently began to make some head against the nervous excitement ; while imagining myself wide awake , I would really doze into momentary unconsciousness , and come suddenly out of it with a physical jerk which nearly wrenched my joints apart -- the delusion of the instant being that I was tumbling backward over a precipice .
Parsing [sent. 1087 len. 87]: After I had fallen over eight or nine precipices and thus found out that one half of my brain had been asleep eight or nine times without the wide-awake , hard-working other half suspecting it , the periodical unconsciousnesses began to extend their spell gradually over more of my brain-territory , and at last I sank into a drowse which grew deeper and deeper and was doubtless just on the very point of being a solid , blessed dreamless stupor , when -- what was that ?
Parsing [sent. 1088 len. 15]: My dulled faculties dragged themselves partly back to life and took a receptive attitude .
Parsing [sent. 1089 len. 40]: Now out of an immense , a limitless distance , came a something which grew and grew , and approached , and presently was recognizable as a sound -- it had rather seemed to be a feeling , before .
Parsing [sent. 1090 len. 43]: This sound was a mile away , now -- perhaps it was the murmur of a storm ; and now it was nearer -- not a quarter of a mile away ; was it the muffled rasping and grinding of distant machinery ?
Parsing [sent. 1091 len. 17]: No , it came still nearer ; was it the measured tramp of a marching troop ?
Parsing [sent. 1092 len. 29]: But it came nearer still , and still nearer -- and at last it was right in the room : it was merely a mouse gnawing the woodwork .
Parsing [sent. 1093 len. 14]: So I had held my breath all that time for such a trifle .
Parsing [sent. 1094 len. 24]: Well , what was done could not be helped ; I would go to sleep at once and make up the lost time .
Parsing [sent. 1095 len. 6]: That was a thoughtless thought .
Parsing [sent. 1096 len. 29]: Without intending it -- hardly knowing it -- I fell to listening intently to that sound , and even unconsciously counting the strokes of the mouse 's nutmeg-grater .
Parsing [sent. 1097 len. 62]: Presently I was deriving exquisite suffering from this employment , yet maybe I could have endured it if the mouse had attended steadily to his work ; but he did not do that ; he stopped every now and then , and I suffered more while waiting and listening for him to begin again than I did while he was gnawing .
Parsing [sent. 1098 len. 38]: Along at first I was mentally offering a reward of five -- six -- seven -- ten -- dollars for that mouse ; but toward the last I was offering rewards which were entirely beyond my means .
Parsing [sent. 1099 len. 62]: I close-reefed my ears -- that is to say , I bent the flaps of them down and furled them into five or six folds , and pressed them against the hearing-orifice -- but it did no good : the faculty was so sharpened by nervous excitement that it was become a microphone and could hear through the overlays without trouble .
Parsing [sent. 1100 len. 7]: My anger grew to a frenzy .
Parsing [sent. 1101 len. 22]: I finally did what all persons before me have done , clear back to Adam , -- resolved to throw something .
Parsing [sent. 1102 len. 24]: I reached down and got my walking-shoes , then sat up in bed and listened , in order to exactly locate the noise .
Parsing [sent. 1103 len. 35]: But I could n't do it ; it was as unlocatable as a cricket 's noise ; and where one thinks that that is , is always the very place where it is n't .
Parsing [sent. 1104 len. 15]: So I presently hurled a shoe at random , and with a vicious vigor .
Parsing [sent. 1105 len. 24]: It struck the wall over Harris 's head and fell down on him ; I had not imagined I could throw so far .
Parsing [sent. 1106 len. 23]: It woke Harris , and I was glad of it until I found he was not angry ; then I was sorry .
Parsing [sent. 1107 len. 25]: He soon went to sleep again , which pleased me ; but straightway the mouse began again , which roused my temper once more .
Parsing [sent. 1108 len. 25]: I did not want to wake Harris a second time , but the gnawing continued until I was compelled to throw the other shoe .
Parsing [sent. 1109 len. 23]: This time I broke a mirror -- there were two in the room -- I got the largest one , of course .
Parsing [sent. 1110 len. 16]: Harris woke again , but did not complain , and I was sorrier than ever .
Parsing [sent. 1111 len. 18]: I resolved that I would suffer all possible torture before I would disturb him a third time .
Parsing [sent. 1112 len. 65]: The mouse eventually retired , and by and by I was sinking to sleep , when a clock began to strike ; I counted till it was done , and was about to drowse again when another clock began ; I counted ; then the two great RATHHAUS clock angels began to send forth soft , rich , melodious blasts from their long trumpets .
Parsing [sent. 1113 len. 35]: I had never heard anything that was so lovely , or weird , or mysterious -- but when they got to blowing the quarter-hours , they seemed to me to be overdoing the thing .
Parsing [sent. 1114 len. 15]: Every time I dropped off for the moment , a new noise woke me .
Parsing [sent. 1115 len. 22]: Each time I woke I missed my coverlet , and had to reach down to the floor and get it again .
Parsing [sent. 1116 len. 7]: At last all sleepiness forsook me .
Parsing [sent. 1117 len. 13]: I recognized the fact that I was hopelessly and permanently wide awake .
Parsing [sent. 1118 len. 8]: Wide awake , and feverish and thirsty .
Parsing [sent. 1119 len. 57]: When I had lain tossing there as long as I could endure it , it occurred to me that it would be a good idea to dress and go out in the great square and take a refreshing wash in the fountain , and smoke and reflect there until the remnant of the night was gone .
Parsing [sent. 1120 len. 12]: I believed I could dress in the dark without waking Harris .
Parsing [sent. 1121 len. 19]: I had banished my shoes after the mouse , but my slippers would do for a summer night .
Parsing [sent. 1122 len. 16]: So I rose softly , and gradually got on everything -- down to one sock .
Parsing [sent. 1123 len. 20]: I could n't seem to get on the track of that sock , any way I could fix it .
Parsing [sent. 1124 len. 44]: But I had to have it ; so I went down on my hands and knees , with one slipper on and the other in my hand , and began to paw gently around and rake the floor , but with no success .
Parsing [sent. 1125 len. 12]: I enlarged my circle , and went on pawing and raking .
Parsing [sent. 1126 len. 12]: With every pressure of my knee , how the floor creaked !
Parsing [sent. 1127 len. 31]: and every time I chanced to rake against any article , it seemed to give out thirty-five or thirty-six times more noise than it would have done in the daytime .
Parsing [sent. 1128 len. 25]: In those cases I always stopped and held my breath till I was sure Harris had not awakened -- then I crept along again .
Parsing [sent. 1129 len. 24]: I moved on and on , but I could not find the sock ; I could not seem to find anything but furniture .
Parsing [sent. 1130 len. 46]: I could not remember that there was much furniture in the room when I went to bed , but the place was alive with it now -- especially chairs -- chairs everywhere -- had a couple of families moved in , in the mean time ?
Parsing [sent. 1131 len. 24]: And I never could seem to GLANCE on one of those chairs , but always struck it full and square with my head .
Parsing [sent. 1132 len. 28]: My temper rose , by steady and sure degrees , and as I pawed on and on , I fell to making vicious comments under my breath .
Parsing [sent. 1133 len. 45]: Finally , with a venomous access of irritation , I said I would leave without the sock ; so I rose up and made straight for the door -- as I supposed -- and suddenly confronted my dim spectral image in the unbroken mirror .
Parsing [sent. 1134 len. 31]: It startled the breath out of me , for an instant ; it also showed me that I was lost , and had no sort of idea where I was .
Parsing [sent. 1135 len. 36]: When I realized this , I was so angry that I had to sit down on the floor and take hold of something to keep from lifting the roof off with an explosion of opinion .
Parsing [sent. 1136 len. 42]: If there had been only one mirror , it might possibly have helped to locate me ; but there were two , and two were as bad as a thousand ; besides , these were on opposite sides of the room .
Parsing [sent. 1137 len. 36]: I could see the dim blur of the windows , but in my turned-around condition they were exactly where they ought not to be , and so they only confused me instead of helping me .
Parsing [sent. 1138 len. 44]: I started to get up , and knocked down an umbrella ; it made a noise like a pistol-shot when it struck that hard , slick , carpetless floor ; I grated my teeth and held my breath -- Harris did not stir .
Parsing [sent. 1139 len. 39]: I set the umbrella slowly and carefully on end against the wall , but as soon as I took my hand away , its heel slipped from under it , and down it came again with another bang .
Parsing [sent. 1140 len. 18]: I shrunk together and listened a moment in silent fury -- no harm done , everything quiet .
Parsing [sent. 1141 len. 27]: With the most painstaking care and nicety , I stood the umbrella up once more , took my hand away , and down it came again .
Parsing [sent. 1142 len. 51]: I have been strictly reared , but if it had not been so dark and solemn and awful there in that lonely , vast room , I do believe I should have said something then which could not be put into a Sunday-school book without injuring the sale of it .
Parsing [sent. 1143 len. 54]: If my reasoning powers had not been already sapped dry by my harassments , I would have known better than to try to set an umbrella on end on one of those glassy German floors in the dark ; it ca n't be done in the daytime without four failures to one success .
Parsing [sent. 1144 len. 19]: I had one comfort , though -- Harris was yet still and silent -- he had not stirred .
Parsing [sent. 1145 len. 19]: The umbrella could not locate me -- there were four standing around the room , and all alike .
Parsing [sent. 1146 len. 16]: I thought I would feel along the wall and find the door in that way .
Parsing [sent. 1147 len. 14]: I rose up and began this operation , but raked down a picture .
Parsing [sent. 1148 len. 16]: It was not a large one , but it made noise enough for a panorama .
Parsing [sent. 1149 len. 26]: Harris gave out no sound , but I felt that if I experimented any further with the pictures I should be sure to wake him .
Parsing [sent. 1150 len. 8]: Better give up trying to get out .
Parsing [sent. 1151 len. 61]: Yes , I would find King Arthur 's Round Table once more -- I had already found it several times -- and use it for a base of departure on an exploring tour for my bed ; if I could find my bed I could then find my water pitcher ; I would quench my raging thirst and turn in .
Parsing [sent. 1152 len. 30]: So I started on my hands and knees , because I could go faster that way , and with more confidence , too , and not knock down things .
Parsing [sent. 1153 len. 35]: By and by I found the table -- with my head -- rubbed the bruise a little , then rose up and started , with hands abroad and fingers spread , to balance myself .
Parsing [sent. 1154 len. 39]: I found a chair ; then a wall ; then another chair ; then a sofa ; then an alpenstock , then another sofa ; this confounded me , for I had thought there was only one sofa .
Parsing [sent. 1155 len. 17]: I hunted up the table again and took a fresh start ; found some more chairs .
Parsing [sent. 1156 len. 107]: It occurred to me , now , as it ought to have done before , that as the table was round , it was therefore of no value as a base to aim from ; so I moved off once more , and at random among the wilderness of chairs and sofas -- wandering off into unfamiliar regions , and presently knocked a candlestick and knocked off a lamp , grabbed at the lamp and knocked off a water pitcher with a rattling crash , and thought to myself , `` I 've found you at last -- I judged I was close upon you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1157 len. 21]: Harris shouted `` murder , '' and `` thieves , '' and finished with `` I 'm absolutely drowned . ''
Parsing [sent. 1158 len. 7]: The crash had roused the house .
Parsing [sent. 1159 len. 49]: Mr. X pranced in , in his long night-garment , with a candle , young Z after him with another candle ; a procession swept in at another door , with candles and lanterns -- landlord and two German guests in their nightgowns and a chambermaid in hers .
Parsing [sent. 1160 len. 19]: I looked around ; I was at Harris 's bed , a Sabbath-day 's journey from my own .
Parsing [sent. 1161 len. 46]: There was only one sofa ; it was against the wall ; there was only one chair where a body could get at it -- I had been revolving around it like a planet , and colliding with it like a comet half the night .
Parsing [sent. 1162 len. 12]: I explained how I had been employing myself , and why .
Parsing [sent. 1163 len. 27]: Then the landlord 's party left , and the rest of us set about our preparations for breakfast , for the dawn was ready to break .
Parsing [sent. 1164 len. 15]: I glanced furtively at my pedometer , and found I had made 47 miles .
Parsing [sent. 1165 len. 17]: But I did not care , for I had come out for a pedestrian tour anyway .
Parsing [sent. 1166 len. 45]: CHAPTER XIV -LSB- Rafting Down the Neckar -RSB- When the landlord learned that I and my agents were artists , our party rose perceptibly in his esteem ; we rose still higher when he learned that we were making a pedestrian tour of Europe .
Parsing [sent. 1167 len. 101]: He told us all about the Heidelberg road , and which were the best places to avoid and which the best ones to tarry at ; he charged me less than cost for the things I broke in the night ; he put up a fine luncheon for us and added to it a quantity of great light-green plums , the pleasantest fruit in Germany ; he was so anxious to do us honor that he would not allow us to walk out of Heilbronn , but called up Goetz von Berlichingen 's horse and cab and made us ride .
Parsing [sent. 1168 len. 8]: I made a sketch of the turnout .
Parsing [sent. 1169 len. 26]: It is not a Work , it is only what artists call a `` study '' -- a thing to make a finished picture from .
Parsing [sent. 1170 len. 23]: This sketch has several blemishes in it ; for instance , the wagon is not traveling as fast as the horse is .
Parsing [sent. 1171 len. 4]: This is wrong .
Parsing [sent. 1172 len. 25]: Again , the person trying to get out of the way is too small ; he is out of perspective , as we say .
Parsing [sent. 1173 len. 36]: The two upper lines are not the horse 's back , they are the reigns ; there seems to be a wheel missing -- this would be corrected in a finished Work , of course .
Parsing [sent. 1174 len. 15]: This thing flying out behind is not a flag , it is a curtain .
Parsing [sent. 1175 len. 19]: That other thing up there is the sun , but I did n't get enough distance on it .
Parsing [sent. 1176 len. 33]: I do not remember , now , what that thing is that is in front of the man who is running , but I think it is a haystack or a woman .
Parsing [sent. 1177 len. 26]: This study was exhibited in the Paris Salon of 1879 , but did not take any medal ; they do not give medals for studies .
Parsing [sent. 1178 len. 8]: We discharged the carriage at the bridge .
Parsing [sent. 1179 len. 35]: The river was full of logs -- long , slender , barkless pine logs -- and we leaned on the rails of the bridge , and watched the men put them together into rafts .
Parsing [sent. 1180 len. 19]: These rafts were of a shape and construction to suit the crookedness and extreme narrowness of the Neckar .
Parsing [sent. 1181 len. 30]: They were from fifty to one hundred yards long , and they gradually tapered from a nine-log breadth at their sterns , to a three-log breadth at their bow-ends .
Parsing [sent. 1182 len. 43]: The main part of the steering is done at the bow , with a pole ; the three-log breadth there furnishes room for only the steersman , for these little logs are not larger around than an average young lady 's waist .
Parsing [sent. 1183 len. 35]: The connections of the several sections of the raft are slack and pliant , so that the raft may be readily bent into any sort of curve required by the shape of the river .
Parsing [sent. 1184 len. 48]: The Neckar is in many places so narrow that a person can throw a dog across it , if he has one ; when it is also sharply curved in such places , the raftsman has to do some pretty nice snug piloting to make the turns .
Parsing [sent. 1185 len. 54]: The river is not always allowed to spread over its whole bed -- which is as much as thirty , and sometimes forty yards wide -- but is split into three equal bodies of water , by stone dikes which throw the main volume , depth , and current into the central one .
Parsing [sent. 1186 len. 32]: In low water these neat narrow-edged dikes project four or five inches above the surface , like the comb of a submerged roof , but in high water they are overflowed .
Parsing [sent. 1187 len. 18]: A hatful of rain makes high water in the Neckar , and a basketful produces an overflow .
Parsing [sent. 1188 len. 18]: There are dikes abreast the Schloss Hotel , and the current is violently swift at that point .
Parsing [sent. 1189 len. 74]: I used to sit for hours in my glass cage , watching the long , narrow rafts slip along through the central channel , grazing the right-bank dike and aiming carefully for the middle arch of the stone bridge below ; I watched them in this way , and lost all this time hoping to see one of them hit the bridge-pier and wreck itself sometime or other , but was always disappointed .
Parsing [sent. 1190 len. 27]: One was smashed there one morning , but I had just stepped into my room a moment to light a pipe , so I lost it .
Parsing [sent. 1191 len. 40]: While I was looking down upon the rafts that morning in Heilbronn , the daredevil spirit of adventure came suddenly upon me , and I said to my comrades : `` I am going to Heidelberg on a raft .
Parsing [sent. 1192 len. 7]: Will you venture with me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1193 len. 18]: Their faces paled a little , but they assented with as good a grace as they could .
Parsing [sent. 1194 len. 55]: Harris wanted to cable his mother -- thought it his duty to do that , as he was all she had in this world -- so , while he attended to this , I went down to the longest and finest raft and hailed the captain with a hearty `` Ahoy , shipmate ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1195 len. 15]: which put us upon pleasant terms at once , and we entered upon business .
Parsing [sent. 1196 len. 20]: I said we were on a pedestrian tour to Heidelberg , and would like to take passage with him .
Parsing [sent. 1197 len. 25]: I said this partly through young Z , who spoke German very well , and partly through Mr. X , who spoke it peculiarly .
Parsing [sent. 1198 len. 22]: I can UNDERSTAND German as well as the maniac that invented it , but I TALK it best through an interpreter .
Parsing [sent. 1199 len. 13]: The captain hitched up his trousers , then shifted his quid thoughtfully .
Parsing [sent. 1200 len. 43]: Presently he said just what I was expecting he would say -- that he had no license to carry passengers , and therefore was afraid the law would be after him in case the matter got noised about or any accident happened .
Parsing [sent. 1201 len. 16]: So I CHARTERED the raft and the crew and took all the responsibilities on myself .
Parsing [sent. 1202 len. 45]: With a rattling song the starboard watch bent to their work and hove the cable short , then got the anchor home , and our bark moved off with a stately stride , and soon was bowling along at about two knots an hour .
Parsing [sent. 1203 len. 6]: Our party were grouped amidships .
Parsing [sent. 1204 len. 101]: At first the talk was a little gloomy , and ran mainly upon the shortness of life , the uncertainty of it , the perils which beset it , and the need and wisdom of being always prepared for the worst ; this shaded off into low-voiced references to the dangers of the deep , and kindred matters ; but as the gray east began to redden and the mysterious solemnity and silence of the dawn to give place to the joy-songs of the birds , the talk took a cheerier tone , and our spirits began to rise steadily .
Parsing [sent. 1205 len. 43]: Germany , in the summer , is the perfection of the beautiful , but nobody has understood , and realized , and enjoyed the utmost possibilities of this soft and peaceful beauty unless he has voyaged down the Neckar on a raft .
Parsing [sent. 1206 len. 73]: The motion of a raft is the needful motion ; it is gentle , and gliding , and smooth , and noiseless ; it calms down all feverish activities , it soothes to sleep all nervous hurry and impatience ; under its restful influence all the troubles and vexations and sorrows that harass the mind vanish away , and existence becomes a dream , a charm , a deep and tranquil ecstasy .
Parsing [sent. 1207 len. 27]: How it contrasts with hot and perspiring pedestrianism , and dusty and deafening railroad rush , and tedious jolting behind tired horses over blinding white roads !
Parsing [sent. 1208 len. 30]: We went slipping silently along , between the green and fragrant banks , with a sense of pleasure and contentment that grew , and grew , all the time .
Parsing [sent. 1209 len. 89]: Sometimes the banks were overhung with thick masses of willows that wholly hid the ground behind ; sometimes we had noble hills on one hand , clothed densely with foliage to their tops , and on the other hand open levels blazing with poppies , or clothed in the rich blue of the corn-flower ; sometimes we drifted in the shadow of forests , and sometimes along the margin of long stretches of velvety grass , fresh and green and bright , a tireless charm to the eye .
Parsing [sent. 1210 len. 4]: And the birds !
Parsing [sent. 1211 len. 23]: -- they were everywhere ; they swept back and forth across the river constantly , and their jubilant music was never stilled .
Parsing [sent. 1212 len. 42]: It was a deep and satisfying pleasure to see the sun create the new morning , and gradually , patiently , lovingly , clothe it on with splendor after splendor , and glory after glory , till the miracle was complete .
Parsing [sent. 1213 len. 41]: How different is this marvel observed from a raft , from what it is when one observes it through the dingy windows of a railway-station in some wretched village while he munches a petrified sandwich and waits for the train .

Parsing [sent. 1265 len. 41]: The people often stepped aboard the raft , as we glided along the grassy shores , and gossiped with us and with the crew for a hundred yards or so , then stepped ashore again , refreshed by the ride .
Parsing [sent. 1266 len. 12]: Only the men did this ; the women were too busy .
Parsing [sent. 1267 len. 11]: The women do all kinds of work on the continent .
Parsing [sent. 1268 len. 57]: They dig , they hoe , they reap , they sow , they bear monstrous burdens on their backs , they shove similar ones long distances on wheelbarrows , they drag the cart when there is no dog or lean cow to drag it -- and when there is , they assist the dog or cow .
Parsing [sent. 1269 len. 16]: Age is no matter -- the older the woman the stronger she is , apparently .
Parsing [sent. 1270 len. 39]: On the farm a woman 's duties are not defined -- she does a little of everything ; but in the towns it is different , there she only does certain things , the men do the rest .
Parsing [sent. 1271 len. 50]: For instance , a hotel chambermaid has nothing to do but make beds and fires in fifty or sixty rooms , bring towels and candles , and fetch several tons of water up several flights of stairs , a hundred pounds at a time , in prodigious metal pitchers .
Parsing [sent. 1272 len. 41]: She does not have to work more than eighteen or twenty hours a day , and she can always get down on her knees and scrub the floors of halls and closets when she is tired and needs a rest .
Parsing [sent. 1273 len. 46]: As the morning advanced and the weather grew hot , we took off our outside clothing and sat in a row along the edge of the raft and enjoyed the scenery , with our sun-umbrellas over our heads and our legs dangling in the water .
Parsing [sent. 1274 len. 12]: Every now and then we plunged in and had a swim .
Parsing [sent. 1275 len. 43]: Every projecting grassy cape had its joyous group of naked children , the boys to themselves and the girls to themselves , the latter usually in care of some motherly dame who sat in the shade of a tree with her knitting .
Parsing [sent. 1276 len. 38]: The little boys swam out to us , sometimes , but the little maids stood knee-deep in the water and stopped their splashing and frolicking to inspect the raft with their innocent eyes as it drifted by .
Parsing [sent. 1277 len. 23]: Once we turned a corner suddenly and surprised a slender girl of twelve years or upward , just stepping into the water .
Parsing [sent. 1278 len. 43]: She had not time to run , but she did what answered just as well ; she promptly drew a lithe young willow bough athwart her white body with one hand , and then contemplated us with a simple and untroubled interest .
Parsing [sent. 1279 len. 8]: Thus she stood while we glided by .
Parsing [sent. 1280 len. 32]: She was a pretty creature , and she and her willow bough made a very pretty picture , and one which could not offend the modesty of the most fastidious spectator .
Parsing [sent. 1281 len. 41]: Her white skin had a low bank of fresh green willows for background and effective contrast -- for she stood against them -- and above and out of them projected the eager faces and white shoulders of two smaller girls .
Parsing [sent. 1282 len. 14]: Toward noon we heard the inspiriting cry , -- `` Sail ho ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1283 len. 5]: `` Where away ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1284 len. 4]: shouted the captain .
Parsing [sent. 1285 len. 9]: `` Three points off the weather bow ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1286 len. 8]: We ran forward to see the vessel .
Parsing [sent. 1287 len. 26]: It proved to be a steamboat -- for they had begun to run a steamer up the Neckar , for the first time in May .
Parsing [sent. 1288 len. 15]: She was a tug , and one of a very peculiar build and aspect .
Parsing [sent. 1289 len. 25]: I had often watched her from the hotel , and wondered how she propelled herself , for apparently she had no propeller or paddles .
Parsing [sent. 1290 len. 31]: She came churning along , now , making a deal of noise of one kind or another , and aggravating it every now and then by blowing a hoarse whistle .
Parsing [sent. 1291 len. 18]: She had nine keel-boats hitched on behind and following after her in a long , slender rank .
Parsing [sent. 1292 len. 24]: We met her in a narrow place , between dikes , and there was hardly room for us both in the cramped passage .
Parsing [sent. 1293 len. 17]: As she went grinding and groaning by , we perceived the secret of her moving impulse .
Parsing [sent. 1294 len. 23]: She did not drive herself up the river with paddles or propeller , she pulled herself by hauling on a great chain .
Parsing [sent. 1295 len. 19]: This chain is laid in the bed of the river and is only fastened at the two ends .
Parsing [sent. 1296 len. 6]: It is seventy miles long .
Parsing [sent. 1297 len. 20]: It comes in over the boat 's bow , passes around a drum , and is payed out astern .
Parsing [sent. 1298 len. 17]: She pulls on that chain , and so drags herself up the river or down it .
Parsing [sent. 1299 len. 25]: She has neither bow or stern , strictly speaking , for she has a long-bladed rudder on each end and she never turns around .
Parsing [sent. 1300 len. 39]: She uses both rudders all the time , and they are powerful enough to enable her to turn to the right or the left and steer around curves , in spite of the strong resistance of the chain .
Parsing [sent. 1301 len. 34]: I would not have believed that that impossible thing could be done ; but I saw it done , and therefore I know that there is one impossible thing which CAN be done .
Parsing [sent. 1302 len. 7]: What miracle will man attempt next ?
Parsing [sent. 1303 len. 25]: We met many big keel-boats on their way up , using sails , mule power , and profanity -- a tedious and laborious business .
Parsing [sent. 1304 len. 56]: A wire rope led from the foretopmast to the file of mules on the tow-path a hundred yards ahead , and by dint of much banging and swearing and urging , the detachment of drivers managed to get a speed of two or three miles an hour out of the mules against the stiff current .
Parsing [sent. 1305 len. 79]: The Neckar has always been used as a canal , and thus has given employment to a great many men and animals ; but now that this steamboat is able , with a small crew and a bushel or so of coal , to take nine keel-boats farther up the river in one hour than thirty men and thirty mules can do it in two , it is believed that the old-fashioned towing industry is on its death-bed .
Parsing [sent. 1306 len. 19]: A second steamboat began work in the Neckar three months after the first one was put in service .
Parsing [sent. 1307 len. 47]: -LSB- Figure 4 -RSB- At noon we stepped ashore and bought some bottled beer and got some chickens cooked , while the raft waited ; then we immediately put to sea again , and had our dinner while the beer was cold and the chickens hot .
Parsing [sent. 1308 len. 40]: There is no pleasanter place for such a meal than a raft that is gliding down the winding Neckar past green meadows and wooded hills , and slumbering villages , and craggy heights graced with crumbling towers and battlements .
Parsing [sent. 1309 len. 14]: In one place we saw a nicely dressed German gentleman without any spectacles .
Parsing [sent. 1310 len. 11]: Before I could come to anchor he had got underway .
Parsing [sent. 1311 len. 6]: It was a great pity .
Parsing [sent. 1312 len. 10]: I so wanted to make a sketch of him .
Parsing [sent. 1313 len. 38]: The captain comforted me for my loss , however , by saying that the man was without any doubt a fraud who had spectacles , but kept them in his pocket in order to make himself conspicuous .
Parsing [sent. 1314 len. 13]: Below Hassmersheim we passed Hornberg , Goetz von Berlichingen 's old castle .
Parsing [sent. 1315 len. 33]: It stands on a bold elevation two hundred feet above the surface of the river ; it has high vine-clad walls enclosing trees , and a peaked tower about seventy-five feet high .
Parsing [sent. 1316 len. 25]: The steep hillside , from the castle clear down to the water 's edge , is terraced , and clothed thick with grape vines .
Parsing [sent. 1317 len. 8]: This is like farming a mansard roof .
Parsing [sent. 1318 len. 22]: All the steeps along that part of the river which furnish the proper exposure , are given up to the grape .
Parsing [sent. 1319 len. 10]: That region is a great producer of Rhine wines .
Parsing [sent. 1320 len. 26]: The Germans are exceedingly fond of Rhine wines ; they are put up in tall , slender bottles , and are considered a pleasant beverage .
Parsing [sent. 1321 len. 9]: One tells them from vinegar by the label .
Parsing [sent. 1322 len. 18]: The Hornberg hill is to be tunneled , and the new railway will pass under the castle .
Parsing [sent. 1323 len. 45]: THE CAVE OF THE SPECTER Two miles below Hornberg castle is a cave in a low cliff , which the captain of the raft said had once been occupied by a beautiful heiress of Hornberg -- the Lady Gertrude -- in the old times .
Parsing [sent. 1324 len. 7]: It was seven hundred years ago .
Parsing [sent. 1325 len. 20]: She had a number of rich and noble lovers and one poor and obscure one , Sir Wendel Lobenfeld .
Parsing [sent. 1326 len. 18]: With the native chuckleheadedness of the heroine of romance , she preferred the poor and obscure lover .
Parsing [sent. 1327 len. 62]: With the native sound judgment of the father of a heroine of romance , the von Berlichingen of that day shut his daughter up in his donjon keep , or his oubliette , or his culverin , or some such place , and resolved that she should stay there until she selected a husband from among her rich and noble lovers .
Parsing [sent. 1328 len. 34]: The latter visited her and persecuted her with their supplications , but without effect , for her heart was true to her poor despised Crusader , who was fighting in the Holy Land .
Parsing [sent. 1329 len. 39]: Finally , she resolved that she would endure the attentions of the rich lovers no longer ; so one stormy night she escaped and went down the river and hid herself in the cave on the other side .
Parsing [sent. 1330 len. 16]: Her father ransacked the country for her , but found not a trace of her .
Parsing [sent. 1331 len. 52]: As the days went by , and still no tidings of her came , his conscience began to torture him , and he caused proclamation to be made that if she were yet living and would return , he would oppose her no longer , she might marry whom she would .
Parsing [sent. 1332 len. 36]: The months dragged on , all hope forsook the old man , he ceased from his customary pursuits and pleasures , he devoted himself to pious works , and longed for the deliverance of death .
Parsing [sent. 1333 len. 38]: Now just at midnight , every night , the lost heiress stood in the mouth of her cave , arrayed in white robes , and sang a little love ballad which her Crusader had made for her .
Parsing [sent. 1334 len. 61]: She judged that if he came home alive the superstitious peasants would tell him about the ghost that sang in the cave , and that as soon as they described the ballad he would know that none but he and she knew that song , therefore he would suspect that she was alive , and would come and find her .
Parsing [sent. 1335 len. 21]: As time went on , the people of the region became sorely distressed about the Specter of the Haunted Cave .
Parsing [sent. 1336 len. 24]: It was said that ill luck of one kind or another always overtook any one who had the misfortune to hear that song .
Parsing [sent. 1337 len. 16]: Eventually , every calamity that happened thereabouts was laid at the door of that music .
Parsing [sent. 1338 len. 24]: Consequently , no boatmen would consent to pass the cave at night ; the peasants shunned the place , even in the daytime .
Parsing [sent. 1339 len. 26]: But the faithful girl sang on , night after night , month after month , and patiently waited ; her reward must come at last .
Parsing [sent. 1340 len. 41]: Five years dragged by , and still , every night at midnight , the plaintive tones floated out over the silent land , while the distant boatmen and peasants thrust their fingers into their ears and shuddered out a prayer .
Parsing [sent. 1341 len. 27]: And now came the Crusader home , bronzed and battle-scarred , but bringing a great and splendid fame to lay at the feet of his bride .
Parsing [sent. 1342 len. 51]: The old lord of Hornberg received him as his son , and wanted him to stay by him and be the comfort and blessing of his age ; but the tale of that young girl 's devotion to him and its pathetic consequences made a changed man of the knight .
Parsing [sent. 1343 len. 8]: He could not enjoy his well-earned rest .
Parsing [sent. 1344 len. 52]: He said his heart was broken , he would give the remnant of his life to high deeds in the cause of humanity , and so find a worthy death and a blessed reunion with the brave true heart whose love had more honored him than all his victories in war .
Parsing [sent. 1345 len. 53]: When the people heard this resolve of his , they came and told him there was a pitiless dragon in human disguise in the Haunted Cave , a dread creature which no knight had yet been bold enough to face , and begged him to rid the land of its desolating presence .
Parsing [sent. 1346 len. 7]: He said he would do it .
Parsing [sent. 1347 len. 43]: They told him about the song , and when he asked what song it was , they said the memory of it was gone , for nobody had been hardy enough to listen to it for the past four years and more .
Parsing [sent. 1348 len. 21]: Toward midnight the Crusader came floating down the river in a boat , with his trusty cross-bow in his hands .
Parsing [sent. 1349 len. 27]: He drifted silently through the dim reflections of the crags and trees , with his intent eyes fixed upon the low cliff which he was approaching .
Parsing [sent. 1350 len. 14]: As he drew nearer , he discerned the black mouth of the cave .
Parsing [sent. 1351 len. 8]: Now -- is that a white figure ?
Parsing [sent. 1352 len. 2]: Yes .
Parsing [sent. 1353 len. 64]: The plaintive song begins to well forth and float away over meadow and river -- the cross-bow is slowly raised to position , a steady aim is taken , the bolt flies straight to the mark -- the figure sinks down , still singing , the knight takes the wool out of his ears , and recognizes the old ballad -- too late !
Parsing [sent. 1354 len. 14]: Ah , if he had only not put the wool in his ears !
Parsing [sent. 1355 len. 20]: The Crusader went away to the wars again , and presently fell in battle , fighting for the Cross .
Parsing [sent. 1356 len. 56]: Tradition says that during several centuries the spirit of the unfortunate girl sang nightly from the cave at midnight , but the music carried no curse with it ; and although many listened for the mysterious sounds , few were favored , since only those could hear them who had never failed in a trust .
Parsing [sent. 1357 len. 23]: It is believed that the singing still continues , but it is known that nobody has heard it during the present century .
Parsing [sent. 1358 len. 29]: CHAPTER XVI An Ancient Legend of the Rhine -LSB- The Lorelei -RSB- The last legend reminds one of the `` Lorelei '' -- a legend of the Rhine .
Parsing [sent. 1359 len. 10]: There is a song called `` The Lorelei . ''
Parsing [sent. 1360 len. 30]: Germany is rich in folk-songs , and the words and airs of several of them are peculiarly beautiful -- but `` The Lorelei '' is the people 's favorite .
Parsing [sent. 1361 len. 32]: I could not endure it at first , but by and by it began to take hold of me , and now there is no tune which I like so well .
Parsing [sent. 1362 len. 20]: It is not possible that it is much known in America , else I should have heard it there .
Parsing [sent. 1363 len. 43]: The fact that I never heard it there , is evidence that there are others in my country who have fared likewise ; therefore , for the sake of these , I mean to print the words and music in this chapter .
Parsing [sent. 1364 len. 18]: And I will refresh the reader 's memory by printing the legend of the Lorelei , too .
Parsing [sent. 1365 len. 25]: I have it by me in the LEGENDS OF THE RHINE , done into English by the wildly gifted Garnham , Bachelor of Arts .
Parsing [sent. 1366 len. 21]: I print the legend partly to refresh my own memory , too , for I have never read it before .
Parsing [sent. 1367 len. 52]: THE LEGEND Lore -LRB- two syllables -RRB- was a water nymph who used to sit on a high rock called the Ley or Lei -LRB- pronounced like our word LIE -RRB- in the Rhine , and lure boatmen to destruction in a furious rapid which marred the channel at that spot .
Parsing [sent. 1368 len. 36]: She so bewitched them with her plaintive songs and her wonderful beauty that they forgot everything else to gaze up at her , and so they presently drifted among the broken reefs and were lost .
Parsing [sent. 1369 len. 30]: In those old , old times , the Count Bruno lived in a great castle near there with his son , the Count Hermann , a youth of twenty .
Parsing [sent. 1370 len. 26]: Hermann had heard a great deal about the beautiful Lore , and had finally fallen very deeply in love with her without having seen her .
Parsing [sent. 1371 len. 31]: So he used to wander to the neighborhood of the Lei , evenings , with his Zither and `` Express his Longing in low Singing , '' as Garnham says .
Parsing [sent. 1372 len. 41]: On one of these occasions , `` suddenly there hovered around the top of the rock a brightness of unequaled clearness and color , which , in increasingly smaller circles thickened , was the enchanting figure of the beautiful Lore .
Parsing [sent. 1373 len. 69]: `` An unintentional cry of Joy escaped the Youth , he let his Zither fall , and with extended arms he called out the name of the enigmatical Being , who seemed to stoop lovingly to him and beckon to him in a friendly manner ; indeed , if his ear did not deceive him , she called his name with unutterable sweet Whispers , proper to love .
Parsing [sent. 1374 len. 17]: Beside himself with delight the youth lost his Senses and sank senseless to the earth . ''
Parsing [sent. 1375 len. 8]: After that he was a changed person .
Parsing [sent. 1376 len. 19]: He went dreaming about , thinking only of his fairy and caring for naught else in the world .
Parsing [sent. 1377 len. 36]: `` The old count saw with affliction this changement in his son , '' whose cause he could not divine , and tried to divert his mind into cheerful channels , but to no purpose .
Parsing [sent. 1378 len. 7]: Then the old count used authority .
Parsing [sent. 1379 len. 11]: He commanded the youth to betake himself to the camp .
Parsing [sent. 1380 len. 4]: Obedience was promised .
Parsing [sent. 1381 len. 43]: Garnham says : `` It was on the evening before his departure , as he wished still once to visit the Lei and offer to the Nymph of the Rhine his Sighs , the tones of his Zither , and his Songs .
Parsing [sent. 1382 len. 19]: He went , in his boat , this time accompanied by a faithful squire , down the stream .
Parsing [sent. 1383 len. 37]: The moon shed her silvery light over the whole country ; the steep bank mountains appeared in the most fantastical shapes , and the high oaks on either side bowed their Branches on Hermann 's passing .
Parsing [sent. 1384 len. 72]: As soon as he approached the Lei , and was aware of the surf-waves , his attendant was seized with an inexpressible Anxiety and he begged permission to land ; but the Knight swept the strings of his Guitar and sang : `` Once I saw thee in dark night , In supernatural Beauty bright ; Of Light-rays , was the Figure wove , To share its light , locked-hair strove .
Parsing [sent. 1385 len. 24]: `` Thy Garment color wave-dove By thy hand the sign of love , Thy eyes sweet enchantment , Raying to me , oh !
Parsing [sent. 1386 len. 2]: enchantment .
Parsing [sent. 1387 len. 16]: `` O , wert thou but my sweetheart , How willingly thy love to part !
Parsing [sent. 1388 len. 15]: With delight I should be bound To thy rocky house in deep ground . ''
Parsing [sent. 1389 len. 35]: That Hermann should have gone to that place at all , was not wise ; that he should have gone with such a song as that in his mouth was a most serious mistake .
Parsing [sent. 1390 len. 16]: The Lorelei did not `` call his name in unutterable sweet Whispers '' this time .
Parsing [sent. 1391 len. 60]: No , that song naturally worked an instant and thorough `` changement '' in her ; and not only that , but it stirred the bowels of the whole afflicted region around about there -- for -- `` Scarcely had these tones sounded , everywhere there began tumult and sound , as if voices above and below the water .
Parsing [sent. 1392 len. 45]: On the Lei rose flames , the Fairy stood above , at that time , and beckoned with her right hand clearly and urgently to the infatuated Knight , while with a staff in her left hand she called the waves to her service .
Parsing [sent. 1393 len. 35]: They began to mount heavenward ; the boat was upset , mocking every exertion ; the waves rose to the gunwale , and splitting on the hard stones , the Boat broke into Pieces .
Parsing [sent. 1394 len. 20]: The youth sank into the depths , but the squire was thrown on shore by a powerful wave . ''
Parsing [sent. 1395 len. 26]: The bitterest things have been said about the Lorelei during many centuries , but surely her conduct upon this occasion entitles her to our respect .
Parsing [sent. 1396 len. 27]: One feels drawn tenderly toward her and is moved to forget her many crimes and remember only the good deed that crowned and closed her career .
Parsing [sent. 1397 len. 17]: `` The Fairy was never more seen ; but her enchanting tones have often been heard .
Parsing [sent. 1398 len. 70]: In the beautiful , refreshing , still nights of spring , when the moon pours her silver light over the Country , the listening shipper hears from the rushing of the waves , the echoing Clang of a wonderfully charming voice , which sings a song from the crystal castle , and with sorrow and fear he thinks on the young Count Hermann , seduced by the Nymph . ''
Parsing [sent. 1399 len. 13]: Here is the music , and the German words by Heinrich Heine .
Parsing [sent. 1400 len. 21]: This song has been a favorite in Germany for forty years , and will remain a favorite always , maybe .
Parsing [sent. 1401 len. 22]: -LSB- Figure 5 -RSB- I have a prejudice against people who print things in a foreign language and add no translation .
Parsing [sent. 1402 len. 45]: When I am the reader , and the author considers me able to do the translating myself , he pays me quite a nice compliment -- but if he would do the translating for me I would try to get along without the compliment .
Parsing [sent. 1403 len. 33]: If I were at home , no doubt I could get a translation of this poem , but I am abroad and ca n't ; therefore I will make a translation myself .
Parsing [sent. 1404 len. 73]: It may not be a good one , for poetry is out of my line , but it will serve my purpose -- which is , to give the unGerman young girl a jingle of words to hang the tune on until she can get hold of a good version , made by some one who is a poet and knows how to convey a poetical thought from one language to another .
Parsing [sent. 1405 len. 138]: THE LORELEI I can not divine what it meaneth , This haunting nameless pain : A tale of the bygone ages Keeps brooding through my brain : The faint air cools in the glooming , And peaceful flows the Rhine , The thirsty summits are drinking The sunset 's flooding wine ; The loveliest maiden is sitting High-throned in yon blue air , Her golden jewels are shining , She combs her golden hair ; She combs with a comb that is golden , And sings a weird refrain That steeps in a deadly enchantment The list ` ner 's ravished brain : The doomed in his drifting shallop , Is tranced with the sad sweet tone , He sees not the yawning breakers , He sees but the maid alone : The pitiless billows engulf him !
Parsing [sent. 1406 len. 22]: -- So perish sailor and bark ; And this , with her baleful singing , Is the Lorelei 's gruesome work .
Parsing [sent. 1407 len. 76]: I have a translation by Garnham , Bachelor of Arts , in the LEGENDS OF THE RHINE , but it would not answer the purpose I mentioned above , because the measure is too nobly irregular ; it do n't fit the tune snugly enough ; in places it hangs over at the ends too far , and in other places one runs out of words before he gets to the end of a bar .
Parsing [sent. 1408 len. 22]: Still , Garnham 's translation has high merits , and I am not dreaming of leaving it out of my book .
Parsing [sent. 1409 len. 45]: I believe this poet is wholly unknown in America and England ; I take peculiar pleasure in bringing him forward because I consider that I discovered him : THE LORELEI Translated by L. W. Garnham , B.A. I do not know what it signifies .
Parsing [sent. 1410 len. 6]: That I am so sorrowful ?
Parsing [sent. 1411 len. 14]: A fable of old Times so terrifies , Leaves my heart so thoughtful .
Parsing [sent. 1412 len. 25]: The air is cool and it darkens , And calmly flows the Rhine ; The summit of the mountain hearkens In evening sunshine line .
Parsing [sent. 1413 len. 21]: The most beautiful Maiden entrances Above wonderfully there , Her beautiful golden attire glances , She combs her golden hair .
Parsing [sent. 1414 len. 24]: With golden comb so lustrous , And thereby a song sings , It has a tone so wondrous , That powerful melody rings .
Parsing [sent. 1415 len. 27]: The shipper in the little ship It effects with woe sad might ; He does not see the rocky slip , He only regards dreaded height .
Parsing [sent. 1416 len. 23]: I believe the turbulent waves Swallow the last shipper and boat ; She with her singing craves All to visit hermagic moat .
Parsing [sent. 1417 len. 6]: No translation could be closer .
Parsing [sent. 1418 len. 16]: He has got in all the facts ; and in their regular order , too .
Parsing [sent. 1419 len. 7]: There is not a statistic wanting .
Parsing [sent. 1420 len. 8]: It is as succinct as an invoice .
Parsing [sent. 1421 len. 19]: That is what a translation ought to be ; it should exactly reflect the thought of the original .
Parsing [sent. 1422 len. 44]: You ca n't SING `` Above wonderfully there , '' because it simply wo n't go to the tune , without damaging the singer ; but it is a most clingingly exact translation of DORT OBEN WUNDERBAR -- fits it like a blister .
Parsing [sent. 1423 len. 23]: Mr. Garnham 's reproduction has other merits -- a hundred of them -- but it is not necessary to point them out .
Parsing [sent. 1424 len. 5]: They will be detected .
Parsing [sent. 1425 len. 14]: No one with a specialty can hope to have a monopoly of it .
Parsing [sent. 1426 len. 6]: Even Garnham has a rival .
Parsing [sent. 1427 len. 19]: Mr. X had a small pamphlet with him which he had bought while on a visit to Munich .
Parsing [sent. 1428 len. 22]: It was entitled A CATALOGUE OF PICTURES IN THE OLD PINACOTEK , and was written in a peculiar kind of English .
Parsing [sent. 1429 len. 37]: Here are a few extracts : `` It is not permitted to make use of the work in question to a publication of the same contents as well as to the pirated edition of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1430 len. 5]: `` An evening landscape .
Parsing [sent. 1431 len. 21]: In the foreground near a pond and a group of white beeches is leading a footpath animated by travelers . ''
Parsing [sent. 1432 len. 19]: `` A learned man in a cynical and torn dress holding an open book in his hand . ''
Parsing [sent. 1433 len. 15]: `` St. Bartholomew and the Executioner with the knife to fulfil the martyr . ''
Parsing [sent. 1434 len. 7]: `` Portrait of a young man .
Parsing [sent. 1435 len. 28]: A long while this picture was thought to be Bindi Altoviti 's portrait ; now somebody will again have it to be the self-portrait of Raphael . ''
Parsing [sent. 1436 len. 11]: `` Susan bathing , surprised by the two old man .
Parsing [sent. 1437 len. 10]: In the background the lapidation of the condemned . ''
Parsing [sent. 1438 len. 18]: -LRB- `` Lapidation '' is good ; it is much more elegant than `` stoning . '' -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 1439 len. 28]: `` St. Rochus sitting in a landscape with an angel who looks at his plague-sore , whilst the dog the bread in his mouth attents him . ''
Parsing [sent. 1440 len. 3]: `` Spring .
Parsing [sent. 1441 len. 6]: The Goddess Flora , sitting .
Parsing [sent. 1442 len. 11]: Behind her a fertile valley perfused by a river . ''
Parsing [sent. 1443 len. 36]: `` A beautiful bouquet animated by May-bugs , etc. '' `` A warrior in armor with a gypseous pipe in his hand leans against a table and blows the smoke far away of himself . ''
Parsing [sent. 1444 len. 17]: `` A Dutch landscape along a navigable river which perfuses it till to the background . ''
Parsing [sent. 1445 len. 8]: `` Some peasants singing in a cottage .
Parsing [sent. 1446 len. 12]: A woman lets drink a child out of a cup . ''
Parsing [sent. 1447 len. 17]: `` St. John 's head as a boy -- painted in fresco on a brick . ''
Parsing [sent. 1448 len. 6]: -LRB- Meaning a tile . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 1449 len. 26]: `` A young man of the Riccio family , his hair cut off right at the end , dressed in black with the same cap .
Parsing [sent. 1450 len. 11]: Attributed to Raphael , but the signation is false . ''
Parsing [sent. 1451 len. 7]: `` The Virgin holding the Infant .
Parsing [sent. 1452 len. 11]: It is very painted in the manner of Sassoferrato . ''
Parsing [sent. 1453 len. 17]: `` A Larder with greens and dead game animated by a cook-maid and two kitchen-boys . ''
Parsing [sent. 1454 len. 31]: However , the English of this catalogue is at least as happy as that which distinguishes an inscription upon a certain picture in Rome -- to wit : `` Revelations-View .
Parsing [sent. 1455 len. 8]: St. John in Patterson 's Island . ''
Parsing [sent. 1456 len. 8]: But meanwhile the raft is moving on .
Parsing [sent. 1457 len. 35]: CHAPTER XVII -LSB- Why Germans Wear Spectacles -RSB- A mile or two above Eberbach we saw a peculiar ruin projecting above the foliage which clothed the peak of a high and very steep hill .
Parsing [sent. 1458 len. 38]: This ruin consisted of merely a couple of crumbling masses of masonry which bore a rude resemblance to human faces ; they leaned forward and touched foreheads , and had the look of being absorbed in conversation .
Parsing [sent. 1459 len. 30]: This ruin had nothing very imposing or picturesque about it , and there was no great deal of it , yet it was called the `` Spectacular Ruin . ''
Parsing [sent. 1460 len. 50]: LEGEND OF THE `` SPECTACULAR RUIN '' The captain of the raft , who was as full of history as he could stick , said that in the Middle Ages a most prodigious fire-breathing dragon used to live in that region , and made more trouble than a tax-collector .
Parsing [sent. 1461 len. 19]: He was as long as a railway-train , and had the customary impenetrable green scales all over him .
Parsing [sent. 1462 len. 13]: His breath bred pestilence and conflagration , and his appetite bred famine .
Parsing [sent. 1463 len. 12]: He ate men and cattle impartially , and was exceedingly unpopular .
Parsing [sent. 1464 len. 51]: The German emperor of that day made the usual offer : he would grant to the destroyer of the dragon , any one solitary thing he might ask for ; for he had a surplusage of daughters , and it was customary for dragon-killers to take a daughter for pay .
Parsing [sent. 1465 len. 25]: So the most renowned knights came from the four corners of the earth and retired down the dragon 's throat one after the other .
Parsing [sent. 1466 len. 6]: A panic arose and spread .
Parsing [sent. 1467 len. 4]: Heroes grew cautious .
Parsing [sent. 1468 len. 4]: The procession ceased .
Parsing [sent. 1469 len. 8]: The dragon became more destructive than ever .
Parsing [sent. 1470 len. 16]: The people lost all hope of succor , and fled to the mountains for refuge .
Parsing [sent. 1471 len. 25]: At last Sir Wissenschaft , a poor and obscure knight , out of a far country , arrived to do battle with the monster .
Parsing [sent. 1472 len. 24]: A pitiable object he was , with his armor hanging in rags about him , and his strange-shaped knapsack strapped upon his back .
Parsing [sent. 1473 len. 14]: Everybody turned up their noses at him , and some openly jeered him .
Parsing [sent. 1474 len. 5]: But he was calm .
Parsing [sent. 1475 len. 13]: He simply inquired if the emperor 's offer was still in force .
Parsing [sent. 1476 len. 42]: The emperor said it was -- but charitably advised him to go and hunt hares and not endanger so precious a life as his in an attempt which had brought death to so many of the world 's most illustrious heroes .
Parsing [sent. 1477 len. 17]: But this tramp only asked -- `` Were any of these heroes men of science ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1478 len. 16]: This raised a laugh , of course , for science was despised in those days .
Parsing [sent. 1479 len. 10]: But the tramp was not in the least ruffled .
Parsing [sent. 1480 len. 29]: He said he might be a little in advance of his age , but no matter -- science would come to be honored , some time or other .
Parsing [sent. 1481 len. 12]: He said he would march against the dragon in the morning .
Parsing [sent. 1482 len. 30]: Out of compassion , then , a decent spear was offered him , but he declined , and said , `` spears were useless to men of science . ''
Parsing [sent. 1483 len. 20]: They allowed him to sup in the servants ' hall , and gave him a bed in the stables .
Parsing [sent. 1484 len. 14]: When he started forth in the morning , thousands were gathered to see .
Parsing [sent. 1485 len. 21]: The emperor said : `` Do not be rash , take a spear , and leave off your knapsack . ''
Parsing [sent. 1486 len. 18]: But the tramp said : `` It is not a knapsack , '' and moved straight on .
Parsing [sent. 1487 len. 7]: The dragon was waiting and ready .
Parsing [sent. 1488 len. 15]: He was breathing forth vast volumes of sulphurous smoke and lurid blasts of flame .
Parsing [sent. 1489 len. 52]: The ragged knight stole warily to a good position , then he unslung his cylindrical knapsack -- which was simply the common fire-extinguisher known to modern times -- and the first chance he got he turned on his hose and shot the dragon square in the center of his cavernous mouth .
Parsing [sent. 1490 len. 16]: Out went the fires in an instant , and the dragon curled up and died .
Parsing [sent. 1491 len. 9]: This man had brought brains to his aid .
Parsing [sent. 1492 len. 33]: He had reared dragons from the egg , in his laboratory , he had watched over them like a mother , and patiently studied them and experimented upon them while they grew .
Parsing [sent. 1493 len. 33]: Thus he had found out that fire was the life principle of a dragon ; put out the dragon 's fires and it could make steam no longer , and must die .
Parsing [sent. 1494 len. 17]: He could not put out a fire with a spear , therefore he invented the extinguisher .
Parsing [sent. 1495 len. 45]: The dragon being dead , the emperor fell on the hero 's neck and said : `` Deliverer , name your request , '' at the same time beckoning out behind with his heel for a detachment of his daughters to form and advance .
Parsing [sent. 1496 len. 8]: But the tramp gave them no observance .
Parsing [sent. 1497 len. 27]: He simply said : `` My request is , that upon me be conferred the monopoly of the manufacture and sale of spectacles in Germany . ''
Parsing [sent. 1498 len. 17]: The emperor sprang aside and exclaimed : `` This transcends all the impudence I ever heard !
Parsing [sent. 1499 len. 8]: A modest demand , by my halidome !
Parsing [sent. 1500 len. 19]: Why did n't you ask for the imperial revenues at once , and be done with it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1501 len. 13]: But the monarch had given his word , and he kept it .
Parsing [sent. 1502 len. 30]: To everybody 's surprise , the unselfish monopolist immediately reduced the price of spectacles to such a degree that a great and crushing burden was removed from the nation .
Parsing [sent. 1503 len. 39]: The emperor , to commemorate this generous act , and to testify his appreciation of it , issued a decree commanding everybody to buy this benefactor 's spectacles and wear them , whether they needed them or not .
Parsing [sent. 1504 len. 35]: So originated the wide-spread custom of wearing spectacles in Germany ; and as a custom once established in these old lands is imperishable , this one remains universal in the empire to this day .
Parsing [sent. 1505 len. 22]: Such is the legend of the monopolist 's once stately and sumptuous castle , now called the `` Spectacular Ruin . ''
Parsing [sent. 1506 len. 34]: On the right bank , two or three miles below the Spectacular Ruin , we passed by a noble pile of castellated buildings overlooking the water from the crest of a lofty elevation .
Parsing [sent. 1507 len. 31]: A stretch of two hundred yards of the high front wall was heavily draped with ivy , and out of the mass of buildings within rose three picturesque old towers .
Parsing [sent. 1508 len. 17]: The place was in fine order , and was inhabited by a family of princely rank .
Parsing [sent. 1509 len. 29]: This castle had its legend , too , but I should not feel justified in repeating it because I doubted the truth of some of its minor details .
Parsing [sent. 1510 len. 25]: Along in this region a multitude of Italian laborers were blasting away the frontage of the hills to make room for the new railway .
Parsing [sent. 1511 len. 11]: They were fifty or a hundred feet above the river .
Parsing [sent. 1512 len. 23]: As we turned a sharp corner they began to wave signals and shout warnings to us to look out for the explosions .
Parsing [sent. 1513 len. 15]: It was all very well to warn us , but what could WE do ?
Parsing [sent. 1514 len. 55]: You ca n't back a raft upstream , you ca n't hurry it downstream , you ca n't scatter out to one side when you have n't any room to speak of , you wo n't take to the perpendicular cliffs on the other shore when they appear to be blasting there , too .
Parsing [sent. 1515 len. 8]: Your resources are limited , you see .
Parsing [sent. 1516 len. 12]: There is simply nothing for it but to watch and pray .
Parsing [sent. 1517 len. 23]: For some hours we had been making three and a half or four miles an hour and we were still making that .
Parsing [sent. 1518 len. 34]: We had been dancing right along until those men began to shout ; then for the next ten minutes it seemed to me that I had never seen a raft go so slowly .
Parsing [sent. 1519 len. 16]: When the first blast went off we raised our sun-umbrellas and waited for the result .
Parsing [sent. 1520 len. 13]: No harm done ; none of the stones fell in the water .
Parsing [sent. 1521 len. 9]: Another blast followed , and another and another .
Parsing [sent. 1522 len. 13]: Some of the rubbish fell in the water just astern of us .
Parsing [sent. 1523 len. 33]: We ran that whole battery of nine blasts in a row , and it was certainly one of the most exciting and uncomfortable weeks I ever spent , either aship or ashore .
Parsing [sent. 1524 len. 47]: Of course we frequently manned the poles and shoved earnestly for a second or so , but every time one of those spurts of dust and debris shot aloft every man dropped his pole and looked up to get the bearings of his share of it .
Parsing [sent. 1525 len. 11]: It was very busy times along there for a while .
Parsing [sent. 1526 len. 53]: It appeared certain that we must perish , but even that was not the bitterest thought ; no , the abjectly unheroic nature of the death -- that was the sting -- that and the bizarre wording of the resulting obituary : `` SHOT WITH A ROCK , ON A RAFT . ''
Parsing [sent. 1527 len. 9]: There would be no poetry written about it .
Parsing [sent. 1528 len. 7]: None COULD be written about it .
Parsing [sent. 1529 len. 24]: Example : NOT by war 's shock , or war 's shaft , -- SHOT , with a rock , on a raft .
Parsing [sent. 1530 len. 14]: No poet who valued his reputation would touch such a theme as that .
Parsing [sent. 1531 len. 22]: I should be distinguished as the only `` distinguished dead '' who went down to the grave unsonneted , in 1878 .
Parsing [sent. 1532 len. 11]: But we escaped , and I have never regretted it .
Parsing [sent. 1533 len. 49]: The last blast was a peculiarly strong one , and after the small rubbish was done raining around us and we were just going to shake hands over our deliverance , a later and larger stone came down amongst our little group of pedestrians and wrecked an umbrella .
Parsing [sent. 1534 len. 16]: It did no other harm , but we took to the water just the same .
Parsing [sent. 1535 len. 20]: It seems that the heavy work in the quarries and the new railway gradings is done mainly by Italians .
Parsing [sent. 1536 len. 5]: That was a revelation .
Parsing [sent. 1537 len. 33]: We have the notion in our country that Italians never do heavy work at all , but confine themselves to the lighter arts , like organ-grinding , operatic singing , and assassination .
Parsing [sent. 1538 len. 8]: We have blundered , that is plain .
Parsing [sent. 1539 len. 18]: All along the river , near every village , we saw little station-houses for the future railway .
Parsing [sent. 1540 len. 11]: They were finished and waiting for the rails and business .
Parsing [sent. 1541 len. 13]: They were as trim and snug and pretty as they could be .
Parsing [sent. 1542 len. 42]: They were always of brick or stone ; they were of graceful shape , they had vines and flowers about them already , and around them the grass was bright and green , and showed that it was carefully looked after .
Parsing [sent. 1543 len. 13]: They were a decoration to the beautiful landscape , not an offense .
Parsing [sent. 1544 len. 52]: Wherever one saw a pile of gravel or a pile of broken stone , it was always heaped as trimly and exactly as a new grave or a stack of cannon-balls ; nothing about those stations or along the railroad or the wagon-road was allowed to look shabby or be unornamental .
Parsing [sent. 1545 len. 40]: The keeping a country in such beautiful order as Germany exhibits , has a wise practical side to it , too , for it keeps thousands of people in work and bread who would otherwise be idle and mischievous .
Parsing [sent. 1546 len. 27]: As the night shut down , the captain wanted to tie up , but I thought maybe we might make Hirschhorn , so we went on .
Parsing [sent. 1547 len. 14]: Presently the sky became overcast , and the captain came aft looking uneasy .
Parsing [sent. 1548 len. 20]: He cast his eye aloft , then shook his head , and said it was coming on to blow .
Parsing [sent. 1549 len. 15]: My party wanted to land at once -- therefore I wanted to go on .
Parsing [sent. 1550 len. 15]: The captain said we ought to shorten sail anyway , out of common prudence .
Parsing [sent. 1551 len. 13]: Consequently , the larboard watch was ordered to lay in his pole .
Parsing [sent. 1552 len. 14]: It grew quite dark , now , and the wind began to rise .
Parsing [sent. 1553 len. 18]: It wailed through the swaying branches of the trees , and swept our decks in fitful gusts .
Parsing [sent. 1554 len. 8]: Things were taking on an ugly look .
Parsing [sent. 1555 len. 18]: The captain shouted to the steersman on the forward log : `` How 's she landing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1556 len. 24]: The answer came faint and hoarse from far forward : `` Nor ' - east-and-by-nor ' -- east-by-east , half-east , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 1557 len. 9]: `` Let her go off a point ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1558 len. 6]: `` Aye-aye , sir ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1559 len. 8]: `` What water have you got ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1560 len. 5]: `` Shoal , sir .
Parsing [sent. 1561 len. 18]: Two foot large , on the stabboard , two and a half scant on the labboard ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1562 len. 9]: `` Let her go off another point ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1563 len. 6]: `` Aye-aye , sir ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1564 len. 9]: `` Forward , men , all of you !
Parsing [sent. 1565 len. 4]: Lively , now !
Parsing [sent. 1566 len. 11]: Stand by to crowd her round the weather corner ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1567 len. 6]: `` Aye-aye , sir ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1568 len. 39]: Then followed a wild running and trampling and hoarse shouting , but the forms of the men were lost in the darkness and the sounds were distorted and confused by the roaring of the wind through the shingle-bundles .
Parsing [sent. 1569 len. 20]: By this time the sea was running inches high , and threatening every moment to engulf the frail bark .
Parsing [sent. 1570 len. 40]: Now came the mate , hurrying aft , and said , close to the captain 's ear , in a low , agitated voice : `` Prepare for the worst , sir -- we have sprung a leak ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1571 len. 3]: `` Heavens !
Parsing [sent. 1572 len. 3]: where ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1573 len. 10]: `` Right aft the second row of logs . ''
Parsing [sent. 1574 len. 9]: `` Nothing but a miracle can save us !
Parsing [sent. 1575 len. 16]: Do n't let the men know , or there will be a panic and mutiny !
Parsing [sent. 1576 len. 17]: Lay her in shore and stand by to jump with the stern-line the moment she touches .
Parsing [sent. 1577 len. 17]: Gentlemen , I must look to you to second my endeavors in this hour of peril .
Parsing [sent. 1578 len. 13]: You have hats -- go forward and bail for your lives ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1579 len. 15]: Down swept another mighty blast of wind , clothed in spray and thick darkness .
Parsing [sent. 1580 len. 29]: At such a moment as this , came from away forward that most appalling of all cries that are ever heard at sea : `` MAN OVERBOARD ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1581 len. 8]: The captain shouted : `` Hard a-port !
Parsing [sent. 1582 len. 5]: Never mind the man !
Parsing [sent. 1583 len. 9]: Let him climb aboard or wade ashore ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1584 len. 12]: Another cry came down the wind : `` Breakers ahead ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1585 len. 5]: `` Where away ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1586 len. 12]: `` Not a log 's length off her port fore-foot ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1587 len. 44]: We had groped our slippery way forward , and were now bailing with the frenzy of despair , when we heard the mate 's terrified cry , from far aft : `` Stop that dashed bailing , or we shall be aground ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1588 len. 18]: But this was immediately followed by the glad shout : `` Land aboard the starboard transom ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1589 len. 4]: `` Saved ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1590 len. 4]: cried the captain .
Parsing [sent. 1591 len. 17]: `` Jump ashore and take a turn around a tree and pass the bight aboard ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1592 len. 22]: The next moment we were all on shore weeping and embracing for joy , while the rain poured down in torrents .
Parsing [sent. 1593 len. 49]: The captain said he had been a mariner for forty years on the Neckar , and in that time had seen storms to make a man 's cheek blanch and his pulses stop , but he had never , never seen a storm that even approached this one .
Parsing [sent. 1594 len. 5]: How familiar that sounded !
Parsing [sent. 1595 len. 21]: For I have been at sea a good deal and have heard that remark from captains with a frequency accordingly .
Parsing [sent. 1596 len. 41]: We framed in our minds the usual resolution of thanks and admiration and gratitude , and took the first opportunity to vote it , and put it in writing and present it to the captain , with the customary speech .
Parsing [sent. 1597 len. 42]: We tramped through the darkness and the drenching summer rain full three miles , and reached `` The Naturalist Tavern '' in the village of Hirschhorn just an hour before midnight , almost exhausted from hardship , fatigue , and terror .
Parsing [sent. 1598 len. 7]: I can never forget that night .
Parsing [sent. 1599 len. 35]: The landlord was rich , and therefore could afford to be crusty and disobliging ; he did not at all like being turned out of his warm bed to open his house for us .
Parsing [sent. 1600 len. 30]: But no matter , his household got up and cooked a quick supper for us , and we brewed a hot punch for ourselves , to keep off consumption .
Parsing [sent. 1601 len. 53]: After supper and punch we had an hour 's soothing smoke while we fought the naval battle over again and voted the resolutions ; then we retired to exceedingly neat and pretty chambers upstairs that had clean , comfortable beds in them with heirloom pillowcases most elaborately and tastefully embroidered by hand .
Parsing [sent. 1602 len. 21]: Such rooms and beds and embroidered linen are as frequent in German village inns as they are rare in ours .
Parsing [sent. 1603 len. 32]: Our villages are superior to German villages in more merits , excellences , conveniences , and privileges than I can enumerate , but the hotels do not belong in the list .
Parsing [sent. 1604 len. 53]: `` The Naturalist Tavern '' was not a meaningless name ; for all the halls and all the rooms were lined with large glass cases which were filled with all sorts of birds and animals , glass-eyed , ably stuffed , and set up in the most natural eloquent and dramatic attitudes .
Parsing [sent. 1605 len. 16]: The moment we were abed , the rain cleared away and the moon came out .
Parsing [sent. 1606 len. 45]: I dozed off to sleep while contemplating a great white stuffed owl which was looking intently down on me from a high perch with the air of a person who thought he had met me before , but could not make out for certain .
Parsing [sent. 1607 len. 10]: But young Z did not get off so easily .
Parsing [sent. 1608 len. 54]: He said that as he was sinking deliciously to sleep , the moon lifted away the shadows and developed a huge cat , on a bracket , dead and stuffed , but crouching , with every muscle tense , for a spring , and with its glittering glass eyes aimed straight at him .
Parsing [sent. 1609 len. 5]: It made Z uncomfortable .
Parsing [sent. 1610 len. 42]: He tried closing his own eyes , but that did not answer , for a natural instinct kept making him open them again to see if the cat was still getting ready to launch at him -- which she always was .
Parsing [sent. 1611 len. 22]: He tried turning his back , but that was a failure ; he knew the sinister eyes were on him still .
Parsing [sent. 1612 len. 28]: So at last he had to get up , after an hour or two of worry and experiment , and set the cat out in the hall .
Parsing [sent. 1613 len. 7]: So he won , that time .
Parsing [sent. 1614 len. 30]: CHAPTER XVIII -LSB- The Kindly Courtesy of Germans -RSB- In the morning we took breakfast in the garden , under the trees , in the delightful German summer fashion .
Parsing [sent. 1615 len. 30]: The air was filled with the fragrance of flowers and wild animals ; the living portion of the menagerie of the `` Naturalist Tavern '' was all about us .
Parsing [sent. 1616 len. 30]: There were great cages populous with fluttering and chattering foreign birds , and other great cages and greater wire pens , populous with quadrupeds , both native and foreign .
Parsing [sent. 1617 len. 15]: There were some free creatures , too , and quite sociable ones they were .
Parsing [sent. 1618 len. 86]: White rabbits went loping about the place , and occasionally came and sniffed at our shoes and shins ; a fawn , with a red ribbon on its neck , walked up and examined us fearlessly ; rare breeds of chickens and doves begged for crumbs , and a poor old tailless raven hopped about with a humble , shamefaced mein which said , `` Please do not notice my exposure -- think how you would feel in my circumstances , and be charitable . ''
Parsing [sent. 1619 len. 27]: If he was observed too much , he would retire behind something and stay there until he judged the party 's interest had found another object .
Parsing [sent. 1620 len. 13]: I never have seen another dumb creature that was so morbidly sensitive .
Parsing [sent. 1621 len. 59]: Bayard Taylor , who could interpret the dim reasonings of animals , and understood their moral natures better than most men , would have found some way to make this poor old chap forget his troubles for a while , but we have not his kindly art , and so had to leave the raven to his griefs .
Parsing [sent. 1622 len. 21]: After breakfast we climbed the hill and visited the ancient castle of Hirschhorn , and the ruined church near it .
Parsing [sent. 1623 len. 37]: There were some curious old bas-reliefs leaning against the inner walls of the church -- sculptured lords of Hirschhorn in complete armor , and ladies of Hirschhorn in the picturesque court costumes of the Middle Ages .
Parsing [sent. 1624 len. 34]: These things are suffering damage and passing to decay , for the last Hirschhorn has been dead two hundred years , and there is nobody now who cares to preserve the family relics .
Parsing [sent. 1625 len. 70]: In the chancel was a twisted stone column , and the captain told us a legend about it , of course , for in the matter of legends he could not seem to restrain himself ; but I do not repeat his tale because there was nothing plausible about it except that the Hero wrenched this column into its present screw-shape with his hands -- just one single wrench .
Parsing [sent. 1626 len. 9]: All the rest of the legend was doubtful .
Parsing [sent. 1627 len. 13]: But Hirschhorn is best seen from a distance , down the river .
Parsing [sent. 1628 len. 45]: Then the clustered brown towers perched on the green hilltop , and the old battlemented stone wall , stretching up and over the grassy ridge and disappearing in the leafy sea beyond , make a picture whose grace and beauty entirely satisfy the eye .
Parsing [sent. 1629 len. 28]: We descended from the church by steep stone stairways which curved this way and that down narrow alleys between the packed and dirty tenements of the village .
Parsing [sent. 1630 len. 26]: It was a quarter well stocked with deformed , leering , unkempt and uncombed idiots , who held out hands or caps and begged piteously .
Parsing [sent. 1631 len. 27]: The people of the quarter were not all idiots , of course , but all that begged seemed to be , and were said to be .
Parsing [sent. 1632 len. 38]: I was thinking of going by skiff to the next town , Necharsteinach ; so I ran to the riverside in advance of the party and asked a man there if he had a boat to hire .
Parsing [sent. 1633 len. 27]: I suppose I must have spoken High German -- Court German -- I intended it for that , anyway -- so he did not understand me .
Parsing [sent. 1634 len. 21]: I turned and twisted my question around and about , trying to strike that man 's average , but failed .
Parsing [sent. 1635 len. 9]: He could not make out what I wanted .
Parsing [sent. 1636 len. 39]: Now Mr. X arrived , faced this same man , looked him in the eye , and emptied this sentence on him , in the most glib and confident way : `` Can man boat get here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1637 len. 8]: The mariner promptly understood and promptly answered .
Parsing [sent. 1638 len. 56]: I can comprehend why he was able to understand that particular sentence , because by mere accident all the words in it except `` get '' have the same sound and the same meaning in German that they have in English ; but how he managed to understand Mr. X 's next remark puzzled me .
Parsing [sent. 1639 len. 7]: I will insert it , presently .
Parsing [sent. 1640 len. 26]: X turned away a moment , and I asked the mariner if he could not find a board , and so construct an additional seat .
Parsing [sent. 1641 len. 25]: I spoke in the purest German , but I might as well have spoken in the purest Choctaw for all the good it did .
Parsing [sent. 1642 len. 49]: The man tried his best to understand me ; he tried , and kept on trying , harder and harder , until I saw it was really of no use , and said : `` There , do n't strain yourself -- it is of no consequence . ''
Parsing [sent. 1643 len. 17]: Then X turned to him and crisply said : `` MACHEN SIE a flat board . ''
Parsing [sent. 1644 len. 42]: I wish my epitaph may tell the truth about me if the man did not answer up at once , and say he would go and borrow a board as soon as he had lit the pipe which he was filling .
Parsing [sent. 1645 len. 17]: We changed our mind about taking a boat , so we did not have to go .
Parsing [sent. 1646 len. 14]: I have given Mr. X 's two remarks just as he made them .
Parsing [sent. 1647 len. 59]: Four of the five words in the first one were English , and that they were also German was only accidental , not intentional ; three out of the five words in the second remark were English , and English only , and the two German ones did not mean anything in particular , in such a connection .
Parsing [sent. 1648 len. 49]: X always spoke English to Germans , but his plan was to turn the sentence wrong end first and upside down , according to German construction , and sprinkle in a German word without any essential meaning to it , here and there , by way of flavor .
Parsing [sent. 1649 len. 7]: Yet he always made himself understood .
Parsing [sent. 1650 len. 30]: He could make those dialect-speaking raftsmen understand him , sometimes , when even young Z had failed with them ; and young Z was a pretty good German scholar .
Parsing [sent. 1651 len. 15]: For one thing , X always spoke with such confidence -- perhaps that helped .
Parsing [sent. 1652 len. 29]: And possibly the raftsmen 's dialect was what is called PLATT-DEUTSCH , and so they found his English more familiar to their ears than another man 's German .
Parsing [sent. 1653 len. 25]: Quite indifferent students of German can read Fritz Reuter 's charming platt-Deutch tales with some little facility because many of the words are English .
Parsing [sent. 1654 len. 16]: I suppose this is the tongue which our Saxon ancestors carried to England with them .
Parsing [sent. 1655 len. 11]: By and by I will inquire of some other philologist .
Parsing [sent. 1656 len. 63]: However , in the mean time it had transpired that the men employed to calk the raft had found that the leak was not a leak at all , but only a crack between the logs -- a crack that belonged there , and was not dangerous , but had been magnified into a leak by the disordered imagination of the mate .
Parsing [sent. 1657 len. 20]: Therefore we went aboard again with a good degree of confidence , and presently got to sea without accident .
Parsing [sent. 1658 len. 24]: As we swam smoothly along between the enchanting shores , we fell to swapping notes about manners and customs in Germany and elsewhere .
Parsing [sent. 1659 len. 44]: As I write , now , many months later , I perceive that each of us , by observing and noting and inquiring , diligently and day by day , had managed to lay in a most varied and opulent stock of misinformation .
Parsing [sent. 1660 len. 18]: But this is not surprising ; it is very difficult to get accurate details in any country .
Parsing [sent. 1661 len. 21]: For example , I had the idea once , in Heidelberg , to find out all about those five student-corps .
Parsing [sent. 1662 len. 8]: I started with the White Cap corps .
Parsing [sent. 1663 len. 23]: I began to inquire of this and that and the other citizen , and here is what I found out : 1 .
Parsing [sent. 1664 len. 16]: It is called the Prussian Corps , because none but Prussians are admitted to it .
Parsing [sent. 1665 len. 2]: 2 .
Parsing [sent. 1666 len. 11]: It is called the Prussian Corps for no particular reason .
Parsing [sent. 1667 len. 14]: It has simply pleased each corps to name itself after some German state .
Parsing [sent. 1668 len. 2]: 3 .
Parsing [sent. 1669 len. 17]: It is not named the Prussian Corps at all , but only the White Cap Corps .
Parsing [sent. 1670 len. 2]: 4 .
Parsing [sent. 1671 len. 13]: Any student can belong to it who is a German by birth .
Parsing [sent. 1672 len. 2]: 5 .
Parsing [sent. 1673 len. 12]: Any student can belong to it who is European by birth .
Parsing [sent. 1674 len. 2]: 6 .
Parsing [sent. 1675 len. 14]: Any European-born student can belong to it , except he be a Frenchman .
Parsing [sent. 1676 len. 2]: 7 .
Parsing [sent. 1677 len. 14]: Any student can belong to it , no matter where he was born .
Parsing [sent. 1678 len. 2]: 8 .
Parsing [sent. 1679 len. 13]: No student can belong to it who is not of noble blood .
Parsing [sent. 1680 len. 2]: 9 .
Parsing [sent. 1681 len. 17]: No student can belong to it who can not show three full generations of noble descent .
Parsing [sent. 1682 len. 2]: 10 .
Parsing [sent. 1683 len. 7]: Nobility is not a necessary qualification .
Parsing [sent. 1684 len. 2]: 11 .
Parsing [sent. 1685 len. 8]: No moneyless student can belong to it .
Parsing [sent. 1686 len. 2]: 12 .
Parsing [sent. 1687 len. 14]: Money qualification is nonsense -- such a thing has never been thought of .
Parsing [sent. 1688 len. 19]: I got some of this information from students themselves -- students who did not belong to the corps .
Parsing [sent. 1689 len. 26]: I finally went to headquarters -- to the White Caps -- where I would have gone in the first place if I had been acquainted .
Parsing [sent. 1690 len. 29]: But even at headquarters I found difficulties ; I perceived that there were things about the White Cap Corps which one member knew and another one did n't .
Parsing [sent. 1691 len. 20]: It was natural ; for very few members of any organization know ALL that can be known about it .
Parsing [sent. 1692 len. 54]: I doubt there is a man or a woman in Heidelberg who would not answer promptly and confidently three out of every five questions about the White Cap Corps which a stranger might ask ; yet it is a very safe bet that two of the three answers would be incorrect every time .
Parsing [sent. 1693 len. 25]: There is one German custom which is universal -- the bowing courteously to strangers when sitting down at table or rising up from it .
Parsing [sent. 1694 len. 39]: This bow startles a stranger out of his self-possession , the first time it occurs , and he is likely to fall over a chair or something , in his embarrassment , but it pleases him , nevertheless .
Parsing [sent. 1695 len. 41]: One soon learns to expect this bow and be on the lookout and ready to return it ; but to learn to lead off and make the initial bow one 's self is a difficult matter for a diffident man .
Parsing [sent. 1696 len. 52]: One thinks , `` If I rise to go , and tender my bow , and these ladies and gentlemen take it into their heads to ignore the custom of their nation , and not return it , how shall I feel , in case I survive to feel anything . ''
Parsing [sent. 1697 len. 7]: Therefore he is afraid to venture .
Parsing [sent. 1698 len. 17]: He sits out the dinner , and makes the strangers rise first and originate the bowing .
Parsing [sent. 1699 len. 35]: A table d'hôte dinner is a tedious affair for a man who seldom touches anything after the three first courses ; therefore I used to do some pretty dreary waiting because of my fears .
Parsing [sent. 1700 len. 27]: It took me months to assure myself that those fears were groundless , but I did assure myself at last by experimenting diligently through my agent .
Parsing [sent. 1701 len. 26]: I made Harris get up and bow and leave ; invariably his bow was returned , then I got up and bowed myself and retired .
Parsing [sent. 1702 len. 15]: Thus my education proceeded easily and comfortably for me , but not for Harris .
Parsing [sent. 1703 len. 17]: Three courses of a table d'hôte dinner were enough for me , but Harris preferred thirteen .
Parsing [sent. 1704 len. 22]: Even after I had acquired full confidence , and no longer needed the agent 's help , I sometimes encountered difficulties .
Parsing [sent. 1705 len. 102]: Once at Baden-Baden I nearly lost a train because I could not be sure that three young ladies opposite me at table were Germans , since I had not heard them speak ; they might be American , they might be English , it was not safe to venture a bow ; but just as I had got that far with my thought , one of them began a German remark , to my great relief and gratitude ; and before she got out her third word , our bows had been delivered and graciously returned , and we were off .
Parsing [sent. 1706 len. 14]: There is a friendly something about the German character which is very winning .
Parsing [sent. 1707 len. 40]: When Harris and I were making a pedestrian tour through the Black Forest , we stopped at a little country inn for dinner one day ; two young ladies and a young gentleman entered and sat down opposite us .
Parsing [sent. 1708 len. 6]: They were pedestrians , too .
Parsing [sent. 1709 len. 21]: Our knapsacks were strapped upon our backs , but they had a sturdy youth along to carry theirs for them .
Parsing [sent. 1710 len. 11]: All parties were hungry , so there was no talking .
Parsing [sent. 1711 len. 13]: By and by the usual bows were exchanged , and we separated .
Parsing [sent. 1712 len. 61]: As we sat at a late breakfast in the hotel at Allerheiligen , next morning , these young people entered and took places near us without observing us ; but presently they saw us and at once bowed and smiled ; not ceremoniously , but with the gratified look of people who have found acquaintances where they were expecting strangers .
Parsing [sent. 1713 len. 10]: Then they spoke of the weather and the roads .
Parsing [sent. 1714 len. 10]: We also spoke of the weather and the roads .
Parsing [sent. 1715 len. 15]: Next , they said they had had an enjoyable walk , notwithstanding the weather .
Parsing [sent. 1716 len. 11]: We said that that had been our case , too .
Parsing [sent. 1717 len. 21]: Then they said they had walked thirty English miles the day before , and asked how many we had walked .
Parsing [sent. 1718 len. 13]: I could not lie , so I told Harris to do it .
Parsing [sent. 1719 len. 12]: Harris told them we had made thirty English miles , too .
Parsing [sent. 1720 len. 22]: That was true ; we had `` made '' them , though we had had a little assistance here and there .
Parsing [sent. 1721 len. 58]: After breakfast they found us trying to blast some information out of the dumb hotel clerk about routes , and observing that we were not succeeding pretty well , they went and got their maps and things , and pointed out and explained our course so clearly that even a New York detective could have followed it .
Parsing [sent. 1722 len. 17]: And when we started they spoke out a hearty good-by and wished us a pleasant journey .
Parsing [sent. 1723 len. 43]: Perhaps they were more generous with us than they might have been with native wayfarers because we were a forlorn lot and in a strange land ; I do n't know ; I only know it was lovely to be treated so .
Parsing [sent. 1724 len. 78]: Very well , I took an American young lady to one of the fine balls in Baden-Baden , one night , and at the entrance-door upstairs we were halted by an official -- something about Miss Jones 's dress was not according to rule ; I do n't remember what it was , now ; something was wanting -- her back hair , or a shawl , or a fan , or a shovel , or something .
Parsing [sent. 1725 len. 26]: The official was ever so polite , and ever so sorry , but the rule was strict , and he could not let us in .
Parsing [sent. 1726 len. 12]: It was very embarrassing , for many eyes were on us .
Parsing [sent. 1727 len. 27]: But now a richly dressed girl stepped out of the ballroom , inquired into the trouble , and said she could fix it in a moment .
Parsing [sent. 1728 len. 28]: She took Miss Jones to the robing-room , and soon brought her back in regulation trim , and then we entered the ballroom with this benefactress unchallenged .
Parsing [sent. 1729 len. 33]: Being safe , now , I began to puzzle through my sincere but ungrammatical thanks , when there was a sudden mutual recognition -- the benefactress and I had met at Allerheiligen .
Parsing [sent. 1730 len. 66]: Two weeks had not altered her good face , and plainly her heart was in the right place yet , but there was such a difference between these clothes and the clothes I had seen her in before , when she was walking thirty miles a day in the Black Forest , that it was quite natural that I had failed to recognize her sooner .
Parsing [sent. 1731 len. 26]: I had on MY other suit , too , but my German would betray me to a person who had heard it once , anyway .
Parsing [sent. 1732 len. 17]: She brought her brother and sister , and they made our way smooth for that evening .
Parsing [sent. 1733 len. 44]: Well -- months afterward , I was driving through the streets of Munich in a cab with a German lady , one day , when she said : `` There , that is Prince Ludwig and his wife , walking along there . ''
Parsing [sent. 1734 len. 38]: Everybody was bowing to them -- cabmen , little children , and everybody else -- and they were returning all the bows and overlooking nobody , when a young lady met them and made a deep courtesy .
Parsing [sent. 1735 len. 18]: `` That is probably one of the ladies of the court , '' said my German friend .
Parsing [sent. 1736 len. 13]: I said : `` She is an honor to it , then .
Parsing [sent. 1737 len. 4]: I know her .
Parsing [sent. 1738 len. 12]: I do n't know her name , but I know HER .
Parsing [sent. 1739 len. 9]: I have known her at Allerheiligen and Baden-Baden .
Parsing [sent. 1740 len. 26]: She ought to be an Empress , but she may be only a Duchess ; it is the way things go in this way . ''
Parsing [sent. 1741 len. 20]: If one asks a German a civil question , he will be quite sure to get a civil answer .
Parsing [sent. 1742 len. 27]: If you stop a German in the street and ask him to direct you to a certain place , he shows no sign of feeling offended .
Parsing [sent. 1743 len. 26]: If the place be difficult to find , ten to one the man will drop his own matters and go with you and show you .
Parsing [sent. 1744 len. 22]: In London , too , many a time , strangers have walked several blocks with me to show me my way .
Parsing [sent. 1745 len. 11]: There is something very real about this sort of politeness .
Parsing [sent. 1746 len. 35]: Quite often , in Germany , shopkeepers who could not furnish me the article I wanted have sent one of their employees with me to show me a place where it could be had .
Parsing [sent. 1747 len. 17]: CHAPTER XIX -LSB- The Deadly Jest of Dilsberg -RSB- However , I wander from the raft .
Parsing [sent. 1748 len. 54]: We made the port of Necharsteinach in good season , and went to the hotel and ordered a trout dinner , the same to be ready against our return from a two-hour pedestrian excursion to the village and castle of Dilsberg , a mile distant , on the other side of the river .
Parsing [sent. 1749 len. 29]: I do not mean that we proposed to be two hours making two miles -- no , we meant to employ most of the time in inspecting Dilsberg .
Parsing [sent. 1750 len. 7]: For Dilsberg is a quaint place .
Parsing [sent. 1751 len. 10]: It is most quaintly and picturesquely situated , too .
Parsing [sent. 1752 len. 167]: Imagine the beautiful river before you ; then a few rods of brilliant green sward on its opposite shore ; then a sudden hill -- no preparatory gently rising slopes , but a sort of instantaneous hill -- a hill two hundred and fifty or three hundred feet high , as round as a bowl , with the same taper upward that an inverted bowl has , and with about the same relation of height to diameter that distinguishes a bowl of good honest depth -- a hill which is thickly clothed with green bushes -- a comely , shapely hill , rising abruptly out of the dead level of the surrounding green plains , visible from a great distance down the bends of the river , and with just exactly room on the top of its head for its steepled and turreted and roof-clustered cap of architecture , which same is tightly jammed and compacted within the perfectly round hoop of the ancient village wall .
Parsing [sent. 1753 len. 37]: There is no house outside the wall on the whole hill , or any vestige of a former house ; all the houses are inside the wall , but there is n't room for another one .
Parsing [sent. 1754 len. 16]: It is really a finished town , and has been finished a very long time .
Parsing [sent. 1755 len. 47]: There is no space between the wall and the first circle of buildings ; no , the village wall is itself the rear wall of the first circle of buildings , and the roofs jut a little over the wall and thus furnish it with eaves .
Parsing [sent. 1756 len. 50]: The general level of the massed roofs is gracefully broken and relieved by the dominating towers of the ruined castle and the tall spires of a couple of churches ; so , from a distance Dilsberg has rather more the look of a king 's crown than a cap .
Parsing [sent. 1757 len. 27]: That lofty green eminence and its quaint coronet form quite a striking picture , you may be sure , in the flush of the evening sun .
Parsing [sent. 1758 len. 29]: We crossed over in a boat and began the ascent by a narrow , steep path which plunged us at once into the leafy deeps of the bushes .
Parsing [sent. 1759 len. 29]: But they were not cool deeps by any means , for the sun 's rays were weltering hot and there was little or no breeze to temper them .
Parsing [sent. 1760 len. 58]: As we panted up the sharp ascent , we met brown , bareheaded and barefooted boys and girls , occasionally , and sometimes men ; they came upon us without warning , they gave us good day , flashed out of sight in the bushes , and were gone as suddenly and mysteriously as they had come .
Parsing [sent. 1761 len. 13]: They were bound for the other side of the river to work .
Parsing [sent. 1762 len. 12]: This path had been traveled by many generations of these people .
Parsing [sent. 1763 len. 33]: They have always gone down to the valley to earn their bread , but they have always climbed their hill again to eat it , and to sleep in their snug town .
Parsing [sent. 1764 len. 36]: It is said that the Dilsbergers do not emigrate much ; they find that living up there above the world , in their peaceful nest , is pleasanter than living down in the troublous world .
Parsing [sent. 1765 len. 52]: The seven hundred inhabitants are all blood-kin to each other , too ; they have always been blood-kin to each other for fifteen hundred years ; they are simply one large family , and they like the home folks better than they like strangers , hence they persistently stay at home .
Parsing [sent. 1766 len. 17]: It has been said that for ages Dilsberg has been merely a thriving and diligent idiot-factory .
Parsing [sent. 1767 len. 61]: I saw no idiots there , but the captain said , `` Because of late years the government has taken to lugging them off to asylums and otherwheres ; and government wants to cripple the factory , too , and is trying to get these Dilsbergers to marry out of the family , but they do n't like to . ''
Parsing [sent. 1768 len. 20]: The captain probably imagined all this , as modern science denies that the intermarrying of relatives deteriorates the stock .
Parsing [sent. 1769 len. 14]: Arrived within the wall , we found the usual village sights and life .
Parsing [sent. 1770 len. 17]: We moved along a narrow , crooked lane which had been paved in the Middle Ages .
Parsing [sent. 1771 len. 108]: A strapping , ruddy girl was beating flax or some such stuff in a little bit of a good-box of a barn , and she swung her flail with a will -- if it was a flail ; I was not farmer enough to know what she was at ; a frowsy , barelegged girl was herding half a dozen geese with a stick -- driving them along the lane and keeping them out of the dwellings ; a cooper was at work in a shop which I know he did not make so large a thing as a hogshead in , for there was not room .
Parsing [sent. 1772 len. 80]: In the front rooms of dwellings girls and women were cooking or spinning , and ducks and chickens were waddling in and out , over the threshold , picking up chance crumbs and holding pleasant converse ; a very old and wrinkled man sat asleep before his door , with his chin upon his breast and his extinguished pipe in his lap ; soiled children were playing in the dirt everywhere along the lane , unmindful of the sun .
Parsing [sent. 1773 len. 43]: Except the sleeping old man , everybody was at work , but the place was very still and peaceful , nevertheless ; so still that the distant cackle of the successful hen smote upon the ear but little dulled by intervening sounds .
Parsing [sent. 1774 len. 51]: That commonest of village sights was lacking here -- the public pump , with its great stone tank or trough of limpid water , and its group of gossiping pitcher-bearers ; for there is no well or fountain or spring on this tall hill ; cisterns of rain-water are used .
Parsing [sent. 1775 len. 36]: Our alpenstocks and muslin tails compelled attention , and as we moved through the village we gathered a considerable procession of little boys and girls , and so went in some state to the castle .
Parsing [sent. 1776 len. 31]: It proved to be an extensive pile of crumbling walls , arches , and towers , massive , properly grouped for picturesque effect , weedy , grass-grown , and satisfactory .
Parsing [sent. 1777 len. 78]: The children acted as guides ; they walked us along the top of the highest walls , then took us up into a high tower and showed us a wide and beautiful landscape , made up of wavy distances of woody hills , and a nearer prospect of undulating expanses of green lowlands , on the one hand , and castle-graced crags and ridges on the other , with the shining curves of the Neckar flowing between .
Parsing [sent. 1778 len. 26]: But the principal show , the chief pride of the children , was the ancient and empty well in the grass-grown court of the castle .
Parsing [sent. 1779 len. 18]: Its massive stone curb stands up three or four feet above-ground , and is whole and uninjured .
Parsing [sent. 1780 len. 33]: The children said that in the Middle Ages this well was four hundred feet deep , and furnished all the village with an abundant supply of water , in war and peace .
Parsing [sent. 1781 len. 23]: They said that in the old day its bottom was below the level of the Neckar , hence the water-supply was inexhaustible .
Parsing [sent. 1782 len. 71]: But there were some who believed it had never been a well at all , and was never deeper than it is now -- eighty feet ; that at that depth a subterranean passage branched from it and descended gradually to a remote place in the valley , where it opened into somebody 's cellar or other hidden recess , and that the secret of this locality is now lost .
Parsing [sent. 1783 len. 81]: Those who hold this belief say that herein lies the explanation that Dilsberg , besieged by Tilly and many a soldier before him , was never taken : after the longest and closest sieges the besiegers were astonished to perceive that the besieged were as fat and hearty as ever , and were well furnished with munitions of war -- therefore it must be that the Dilsbergers had been bringing these things in through the subterranean passage all the time .
Parsing [sent. 1784 len. 20]: The children said that there was in truth a subterranean outlet down there , and they would prove it .
Parsing [sent. 1785 len. 30]: So they set a great truss of straw on fire and threw it down the well , while we leaned on the curb and watched the glowing mass descend .
Parsing [sent. 1786 len. 8]: It struck bottom and gradually burned out .
Parsing [sent. 1787 len. 5]: No smoke came up .
Parsing [sent. 1788 len. 12]: The children clapped their hands and said : `` You see !
Parsing [sent. 1789 len. 25]: Nothing makes so much smoke as burning straw -- now where did the smoke go to , if there is no subterranean outlet ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1790 len. 12]: So it seemed quite evident that the subterranean outlet indeed existed .
Parsing [sent. 1791 len. 30]: But the finest thing within the ruin 's limits was a noble linden , which the children said was four hundred years old , and no doubt it was .
Parsing [sent. 1792 len. 14]: It had a mighty trunk and a mighty spread of limb and foliage .
Parsing [sent. 1793 len. 13]: The limbs near the ground were nearly the thickness of a barrel .
Parsing [sent. 1794 len. 34]: That tree had witnessed the assaults of men in mail -- how remote such a time seems , and how ungraspable is the fact that real men ever did fight in real armor !
Parsing [sent. 1795 len. 44]: -- and it had seen the time when these broken arches and crumbling battlements were a trim and strong and stately fortress , fluttering its gay banners in the sun , and peopled with vigorous humanity -- how impossibly long ago that seems !
Parsing [sent. 1796 len. 37]: -- and here it stands yet , and possibly may still be standing here , sunning itself and dreaming its historical dreams , when today shall have been joined to the days called `` ancient . ''
Parsing [sent. 1797 len. 31]: Well , we sat down under the tree to smoke , and the captain delivered himself of his legend : THE LEGEND OF DILSBERG CASTLE It was to this effect .
Parsing [sent. 1798 len. 20]: In the old times there was once a great company assembled at the castle , and festivity ran high .
Parsing [sent. 1799 len. 20]: Of course there was a haunted chamber in the castle , and one day the talk fell upon that .
Parsing [sent. 1800 len. 16]: It was said that whoever slept in it would not wake again for fifty years .
Parsing [sent. 1801 len. 55]: Now when a young knight named Conrad von Geisberg heard this , he said that if the castle were his he would destroy that chamber , so that no foolish person might have the chance to bring so dreadful a misfortune upon himself and afflict such as loved him with the memory of it .
Parsing [sent. 1802 len. 25]: Straightway , the company privately laid their heads together to contrive some way to get this superstitious young man to sleep in that chamber .
Parsing [sent. 1803 len. 8]: And they succeeded -- in this way .
Parsing [sent. 1804 len. 26]: They persuaded his betrothed , a lovely mischievous young creature , niece of the lord of the castle , to help them in their plot .
Parsing [sent. 1805 len. 11]: She presently took him aside and had speech with him .
Parsing [sent. 1806 len. 44]: She used all her persuasions , but could not shake him ; he said his belief was firm , that if he should sleep there he would wake no more for fifty years , and it made him shudder to think of it .
Parsing [sent. 1807 len. 5]: Catharina began to weep .
Parsing [sent. 1808 len. 14]: This was a better argument ; Conrad could not hold out against it .
Parsing [sent. 1809 len. 19]: He yielded and said she should have her wish if she would only smile and be happy again .
Parsing [sent. 1810 len. 25]: She flung her arms about his neck , and the kisses she gave him showed that her thankfulness and her pleasure were very real .
Parsing [sent. 1811 len. 39]: Then she flew to tell the company her success , and the applause she received made her glad and proud she had undertaken her mission , since all alone she had accomplished what the multitude had failed in .
Parsing [sent. 1812 len. 22]: At midnight , that night , after the usual feasting , Conrad was taken to the haunted chamber and left there .
Parsing [sent. 1813 len. 8]: He fell asleep , by and by .
Parsing [sent. 1814 len. 16]: When he awoke again and looked about him , his heart stood still with horror !
Parsing [sent. 1815 len. 9]: The whole aspect of the chamber was changed .
Parsing [sent. 1816 len. 28]: The walls were moldy and hung with ancient cobwebs ; the curtains and beddings were rotten ; the furniture was rickety and ready to fall to pieces .
Parsing [sent. 1817 len. 20]: He sprang out of bed , but his quaking knees sunk under him and he fell to the floor .
Parsing [sent. 1818 len. 12]: `` This is the weakness of age , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1819 len. 7]: He rose and sought his clothing .
Parsing [sent. 1820 len. 6]: It was clothing no longer .
Parsing [sent. 1821 len. 19]: The colors were gone , the garments gave way in many places while he was putting them on .
Parsing [sent. 1822 len. 17]: He fled , shuddering , into the corridor , and along it to the great hall .
Parsing [sent. 1823 len. 22]: Here he was met by a middle-aged stranger of a kind countenance , who stopped and gazed at him with surprise .
Parsing [sent. 1824 len. 16]: Conrad said : `` Good sir , will you send hither the lord Ulrich ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1825 len. 16]: The stranger looked puzzled a moment , then said : `` The lord Ulrich ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1826 len. 11]: `` Yes -- if you will be so good . ''
Parsing [sent. 1827 len. 8]: The stranger called -- `` Wilhelm ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1828 len. 23]: A young serving-man came , and the stranger said to him : `` Is there a lord Ulrich among the guests ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1829 len. 14]: `` I know none of the name , so please your honor . ''
Parsing [sent. 1830 len. 23]: Conrad said , hesitatingly : `` I did not mean a guest , but the lord of the castle , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 1831 len. 9]: The stranger and the servant exchanged wondering glances .
Parsing [sent. 1832 len. 15]: Then the former said : `` I am the lord of the castle . ''
Parsing [sent. 1833 len. 7]: `` Since when , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1834 len. 19]: `` Since the death of my father , the good lord Ulrich more than forty years ago . ''
Parsing [sent. 1835 len. 23]: Conrad sank upon a bench and covered his face with his hands while he rocked his body to and fro and moaned .
Parsing [sent. 1836 len. 22]: The stranger said in a low voice to the servant : `` I fear me this poor old creature is mad .
Parsing [sent. 1837 len. 5]: Call some one . ''
Parsing [sent. 1838 len. 16]: In a moment several people came , and grouped themselves about , talking in whispers .
Parsing [sent. 1839 len. 11]: Conrad looked up and scanned the faces about him wistfully .
Parsing [sent. 1840 len. 25]: Then he shook his head and said , in a grieved voice : `` No , there is none among ye that I know .
Parsing [sent. 1841 len. 9]: I am old and alone in the world .
Parsing [sent. 1842 len. 13]: They are dead and gone these many years that cared for me .
Parsing [sent. 1843 len. 24]: But sure , some of these aged ones I see about me can tell me some little word or two concerning them . ''
Parsing [sent. 1844 len. 23]: Several bent and tottering men and women came nearer and answered his questions about each former friend as he mentioned the names .
Parsing [sent. 1845 len. 17]: This one they said had been dead ten years , that one twenty , another thirty .
Parsing [sent. 1846 len. 8]: Each succeeding blow struck heavier and heavier .
Parsing [sent. 1847 len. 26]: At last the sufferer said : `` There is one more , but I have not the courage to -- O my lost Catharina ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1848 len. 18]: One of the old dames said : `` Ah , I knew her well , poor soul .
Parsing [sent. 1849 len. 16]: A misfortune overtook her lover , and she died of sorrow nearly fifty years ago .
Parsing [sent. 1850 len. 11]: She lieth under the linden tree without the court . ''
Parsing [sent. 1851 len. 16]: Conrad bowed his head and said : `` Ah , why did I ever wake !
Parsing [sent. 1852 len. 12]: And so she died of grief for me , poor child .
Parsing [sent. 1853 len. 9]: So young , so sweet , so good !
Parsing [sent. 1854 len. 16]: She never wittingly did a hurtful thing in all the little summer of her life .
Parsing [sent. 1855 len. 17]: Her loving debt shall be repaid -- for I will die of grief for her . ''
Parsing [sent. 1856 len. 7]: His head drooped upon his breast .
Parsing [sent. 1857 len. 49]: In the moment there was a wild burst of joyous laughter , a pair of round young arms were flung about Conrad 's neck and a sweet voice cried : `` There , Conrad mine , thy kind words kill me -- the farce shall go no further !
Parsing [sent. 1858 len. 15]: Look up , and laugh with us -- 't was all a jest ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1859 len. 35]: And he did look up , and gazed , in a dazed wonderment -- for the disguises were stripped away , and the aged men and women were bright and young and gay again .
Parsing [sent. 1860 len. 19]: Catharina 's happy tongue ran on : '' 'T was a marvelous jest , and bravely carried out .
Parsing [sent. 1861 len. 39]: They gave you a heavy sleeping-draught before you went to bed , and in the night they bore you to a ruined chamber where all had fallen to decay , and placed these rags of clothing by you .
Parsing [sent. 1862 len. 52]: And when your sleep was spent and you came forth , two strangers , well instructed in their parts , were here to meet you ; and all we , your friends , in our disguises , were close at hand , to see and hear , you may be sure .
Parsing [sent. 1863 len. 8]: Ah , 't was a gallant jest !
Parsing [sent. 1864 len. 15]: Come , now , and make thee ready for the pleasures of the day .
Parsing [sent. 1865 len. 13]: How real was thy misery for the moment , thou poor lad !
Parsing [sent. 1866 len. 10]: Look up and have thy laugh , now ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1867 len. 38]: He looked up , searched the merry faces about him in a dreamy way , then sighed and said : `` I am aweary , good strangers , I pray you lead me to her grave . ''
Parsing [sent. 1868 len. 19]: All the smile vanished away , every cheek blanched , Catharina sunk to the ground in a swoon .
Parsing [sent. 1869 len. 18]: All day the people went about the castle with troubled faces , and communed together in undertones .
Parsing [sent. 1870 len. 16]: A painful hush pervaded the place which had lately been so full of cheery life .
Parsing [sent. 1871 len. 86]: Each in his turn tried to arouse Conrad out of his hallucination and bring him to himself ; but all the answer any got was a meek , bewildered stare , and then the words : `` Good stranger , I have no friends , all are at rest these many years ; ye speak me fair , ye mean me well , but I know ye not ; I am alone and forlorn in the world -- prithee lead me to her grave . ''
Parsing [sent. 1872 len. 30]: During two years Conrad spent his days , from the early morning till the night , under the linden tree , mourning over the imaginary grave of his Catharina .
Parsing [sent. 1873 len. 10]: Catharina was the only company of the harmless madman .
Parsing [sent. 1874 len. 31]: He was very friendly toward her because , as he said , in some ways she reminded him of his Catharina whom he had lost `` fifty years ago . ''
Parsing [sent. 1875 len. 32]: He often said : `` She was so gay , so happy-hearted -- but you never smile ; and always when you think I am not looking , you cry . ''
Parsing [sent. 1876 len. 28]: When Conrad died , they buried him under the linden , according to his directions , so that he might rest `` near his poor Catharina . ''
Parsing [sent. 1877 len. 49]: Then Catharina sat under the linden alone , every day and all day long , a great many years , speaking to no one , and never smiling ; and at last her long repentance was rewarded with death , and she was buried by Conrad 's side .
Parsing [sent. 1878 len. 76]: Harris pleased the captain by saying it was good legend ; and pleased him further by adding : `` Now that I have seen this mighty tree , vigorous with its four hundred years , I feel a desire to believe the legend for ITS sake ; so I will humor the desire , and consider that the tree really watches over those poor hearts and feels a sort of human tenderness for them . ''
Parsing [sent. 1879 len. 81]: We returned to Necharsteinach , plunged our hot heads into the trough at the town pump , and then went to the hotel and ate our trout dinner in leisurely comfort , in the garden , with the beautiful Neckar flowing at our feet , the quaint Dilsberg looming beyond , and the graceful towers and battlements of a couple of medieval castles -LRB- called the `` Swallow 's Nest '' -LSB- 1 -RSB- and `` The Brothers . '' -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 1880 len. 15]: assisting the rugged scenery of a bend of the river down to our right .
Parsing [sent. 1881 len. 19]: We got to sea in season to make the eight-mile run to Heidelberg before the night shut down .
Parsing [sent. 1882 len. 28]: We sailed by the hotel in the mellow glow of sunset , and came slashing down with the mad current into the narrow passage between the dikes .
Parsing [sent. 1883 len. 29]: I believed I could shoot the bridge myself , and I went to the forward triplet of logs and relieved the pilot of his pole and his responsibility .
Parsing [sent. 1884 len. 2]: 1 .
Parsing [sent. 1885 len. 27]: The seeker after information is referred to Appendix E for our captain 's legend of the `` Swallow 's Nest '' and `` The Brothers . ''
Parsing [sent. 1886 len. 54]: We went tearing along in a most exhilarating way , and I performed the delicate duties of my office very well indeed for a first attempt ; but perceiving , presently , that I really was going to shoot the bridge itself instead of the archway under it , I judiciously stepped ashore .
Parsing [sent. 1887 len. 15]: The next moment I had my long-coveted desire : I saw a raft wrecked .
Parsing [sent. 1888 len. 23]: It hit the pier in the center and went all to smash and scatteration like a box of matches struck by lightning .
Parsing [sent. 1889 len. 42]: I was the only one of our party who saw this grand sight ; the others were attitudinizing , for the benefit of the long rank of young ladies who were promenading on the bank , and so they lost it .
Parsing [sent. 1890 len. 28]: But I helped to fish them out of the river , down below the bridge , and then described it to them as well as I could .
Parsing [sent. 1891 len. 7]: They were not interested , though .
Parsing [sent. 1892 len. 18]: They said they were wet and felt ridiculous and did not care anything for descriptions of scenery .
Parsing [sent. 1893 len. 43]: The young ladies , and other people , crowded around and showed a great deal of sympathy , but that did not help matters ; for my friends said they did not want sympathy , they wanted a back alley and solitude .
Parsing [sent. 1894 len. 24]: CHAPTER XX -LSB- My Precious , Priceless Tear-Jug -RSB- Next morning brought good news -- our trunks had arrived from Hamburg at last .
Parsing [sent. 1895 len. 9]: Let this be a warning to the reader .
Parsing [sent. 1896 len. 14]: The Germans are very conscientious , and this trait makes them very particular .
Parsing [sent. 1897 len. 83]: Therefore if you tell a German you want a thing done immediately , he takes you at your word ; he thinks you mean what you say ; so he does that thing immediately -- according to his idea of immediately -- which is about a week ; that is , it is a week if it refers to the building of a garment , or it is an hour and a half if it refers to the cooking of a trout .
Parsing [sent. 1898 len. 67]: Very well ; if you tell a German to send your trunk to you by `` slow freight , '' he takes you at your word ; he sends it by `` slow freight , '' and you can not imagine how long you will go on enlarging your admiration of the expressiveness of that phrase in the German tongue , before you get that trunk .
Parsing [sent. 1899 len. 30]: The hair on my trunk was soft and thick and youthful , when I got it ready for shipment in Hamburg ; it was baldheaded when it reached Heidelberg .
Parsing [sent. 1900 len. 39]: However , it was still sound , that was a comfort , it was not battered in the least ; the baggagemen seemed to be conscientiously careful , in Germany , of the baggage entrusted to their hands .
Parsing [sent. 1901 len. 18]: There was nothing now in the way of our departure , therefore we set about our preparations .
Parsing [sent. 1902 len. 11]: Naturally my chief solicitude was about my collection of Ceramics .
Parsing [sent. 1903 len. 19]: Of course I could not take it with me , that would be inconvenient , and dangerous besides .
Parsing [sent. 1904 len. 44]: I took advice , but the best brick-a-brackers were divided as to the wisest course to pursue ; some said pack the collection and warehouse it ; others said try to get it into the Grand Ducal Museum at Mannheim for safe keeping .
Parsing [sent. 1905 len. 14]: So I divided the collection , and followed the advice of both parties .
Parsing [sent. 1906 len. 18]: I set aside , for the Museum , those articles which were the most frail and precious .
Parsing [sent. 1907 len. 7]: Among these was my Etruscan tear-jug .
Parsing [sent. 1908 len. 26]: I have made a little sketch of it here ; that thing creeping up the side is not a bug , it is a hole .
Parsing [sent. 1909 len. 16]: I bought this tear-jug of a dealer in antiquities for four hundred and fifty dollars .
Parsing [sent. 1910 len. 5]: It is very rare .
Parsing [sent. 1911 len. 31]: The man said the Etruscans used to keep tears or something in these things , and that it was very hard to get hold of a broken one , now .
Parsing [sent. 1912 len. 8]: I also set aside my Henri II .
Parsing [sent. 1913 len. 2]: plate .
Parsing [sent. 1914 len. 30]: See sketch from my pencil ; it is in the main correct , though I think I have foreshortened one end of it a little too much , perhaps .
Parsing [sent. 1915 len. 15]: This is very fine and rare ; the shape is exceedingly beautiful and unusual .
Parsing [sent. 1916 len. 16]: It has wonderful decorations on it , but I am not able to reproduce them .
Parsing [sent. 1917 len. 23]: It cost more than the tear-jug , as the dealer said there was not another plate just like it in the world .
Parsing [sent. 1918 len. 21]: He said there was much false Henri II ware around , but that the genuineness of this piece was unquestionable .
Parsing [sent. 1919 len. 72]: He showed me its pedigree , or its history , if you please ; it was a document which traced this plate 's movements all the way down from its birth -- showed who bought it , from whom , and what he paid for it -- from the first buyer down to me , whereby I saw that it had gone steadily up from thirty-five cents to seven hundred dollars .
Parsing [sent. 1920 len. 30]: He said that the whole Ceramic world would be informed that it was now in my possession and would make a note of it , with the price paid .
Parsing [sent. 1921 len. 21]: -LSB- Figure 8 -RSB- There were Masters in those days , but , alas -- it is not so now .
Parsing [sent. 1922 len. 35]: Of course the main preciousness of this piece lies in its color ; it is that old sensuous , pervading , ramifying , interpolating , transboreal blue which is the despair of modern art .
Parsing [sent. 1923 len. 30]: The little sketch which I have made of this gem can not and does not do it justice , since I have been obliged to leave out the color .
Parsing [sent. 1924 len. 9]: But I 've got the expression , though .
Parsing [sent. 1925 len. 16]: However , I must not be frittering away the reader 's time with these details .
Parsing [sent. 1926 len. 61]: I did not intend to go into any detail at all , at first , but it is the failing of the true ceramiker , or the true devotee in any department of brick-a-brackery , that once he gets his tongue or his pen started on his darling theme , he can not well stop until he drops from exhaustion .
Parsing [sent. 1927 len. 21]: He has no more sense of the flight of time than has any other lover when talking of his sweetheart .
Parsing [sent. 1928 len. 49]: The very `` marks '' on the bottom of a piece of rare crockery are able to throw me into a gibbering ecstasy ; and I could forsake a drowning relative to help dispute about whether the stopple of a departed Buon Retiro scent-bottle was genuine or spurious .
Parsing [sent. 1929 len. 136]: Many people say that for a male person , bric-a-brac hunting is about as robust a business as making doll-clothes , or decorating Japanese pots with decalcomania butterflies would be , and these people fling mud at the elegant Englishman , Byng , who wrote a book called THE BRIC-A-BRAC HUNTER , and make fun of him for chasing around after what they choose to call `` his despicable trifles '' ; and for `` gushing '' over these trifles ; and for exhibiting his `` deep infantile delight '' in what they call his `` tuppenny collection of beggarly trivialities '' ; and for beginning his book with a picture of himself seated , in a `` sappy , self-complacent attitude , in the midst of his poor little ridiculous bric-a-brac junk shop . ''
Parsing [sent. 1930 len. 46]: It is easy to say these things ; it is easy to revile us , easy to despise us ; therefore , let these people rail on ; they can not feel as Byng and I feel -- it is their loss , not ours .
Parsing [sent. 1931 len. 24]: For my part I am content to be a brick-a-bracker and a ceramiker -- more , I am proud to be so named .
Parsing [sent. 1932 len. 38]: I am proud to know that I lose my reason as immediately in the presence of a rare jug with an illustrious mark on the bottom of it , as if I had just emptied that jug .
Parsing [sent. 1933 len. 34]: Very well ; I packed and stored a part of my collection , and the rest of it I placed in the care of the Grand Ducal Museum in Mannheim , by permission .
Parsing [sent. 1934 len. 9]: My Old Blue China Cat remains there yet .
Parsing [sent. 1935 len. 8]: I presented it to that excellent institution .
Parsing [sent. 1936 len. 9]: I had but one misfortune with my things .
Parsing [sent. 1937 len. 17]: An egg which I had kept back from breakfast that morning , was broken in packing .
Parsing [sent. 1938 len. 6]: It was a great pity .
Parsing [sent. 1939 len. 20]: I had shown it to the best connoisseurs in Heidelberg , and they all said it was an antique .
Parsing [sent. 1940 len. 16]: We spent a day or two in farewell visits , and then left for Baden-Baden .
Parsing [sent. 1941 len. 16]: We had a pleasant trip to it , for the Rhine valley is always lovely .
Parsing [sent. 1942 len. 11]: The only trouble was that the trip was too short .
Parsing [sent. 1943 len. 29]: If I remember rightly it only occupied a couple of hours , therefore I judge that the distance was very little , if any , over fifty miles .
Parsing [sent. 1944 len. 41]: We quitted the train at Oos , and walked the entire remaining distance to Baden-Baden , with the exception of a lift of less than an hour which we got on a passing wagon , the weather being exhaustingly warm .
Parsing [sent. 1945 len. 7]: We came into town on foot .
Parsing [sent. 1946 len. 56]: One of the first persons we encountered , as we walked up the street , was the Rev. Mr. ------ , an old friend from America -- a lucky encounter , indeed , for his is a most gentle , refined , and sensitive nature , and his company and companionship are a genuine refreshment .
Parsing [sent. 1947 len. 21]: We knew he had been in Europe some time , but were not at all expecting to run across him .
Parsing [sent. 1948 len. 66]: Both parties burst forth into loving enthusiasms , and Rev. Mr. ------ said : `` I have got a brimful reservoir of talk to pour out on you , and an empty one ready and thirsting to receive what you have got ; we will sit up till midnight and have a good satisfying interchange , for I leave here early in the morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 1949 len. 8]: We agreed to that , of course .
Parsing [sent. 1950 len. 84]: I had been vaguely conscious , for a while , of a person who was walking in the street abreast of us ; I had glanced furtively at him once or twice , and noticed that he was a fine , large , vigorous young fellow , with an open , independent countenance , faintly shaded with a pale and even almost imperceptible crop of early down , and that he was clothed from head to heel in cool and enviable snow-white linen .
Parsing [sent. 1951 len. 18]: I thought I had also noticed that his head had a sort of listening tilt to it .
Parsing [sent. 1952 len. 56]: Now about this time the Rev. Mr. ------ said : `` The sidewalk is hardly wide enough for three , so I will walk behind ; but keep the talk going , keep the talk going , there 's no time to lose , and you may be sure I will do my share . ''
Parsing [sent. 1953 len. 51]: He ranged himself behind us , and straightway that stately snow-white young fellow closed up to the sidewalk alongside him , fetched him a cordial slap on the shoulder with his broad palm , and sung out with a hearty cheeriness : `` AMERICANS for two-and-a-half and the money up !
Parsing [sent. 1954 len. 3]: HEY ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1955 len. 16]: The Reverend winced , but said mildly : `` Yes -- we are Americans . ''
Parsing [sent. 1956 len. 20]: `` Lord love you , you can just bet that 's what _ I _ am , every time !
Parsing [sent. 1957 len. 5]: Put it there ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1958 len. 34]: He held out his Sahara of his palm , and the Reverend laid his diminutive hand in it , and got so cordial a shake that we heard his glove burst under it .
Parsing [sent. 1959 len. 12]: `` Say , did n't I put you up right ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1960 len. 6]: `` Oh , yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1961 len. 3]: `` Sho !
Parsing [sent. 1962 len. 13]: I spotted you for MY kind the minute I heard your clack .
Parsing [sent. 1963 len. 7]: You been over here long ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1964 len. 5]: `` About four months .
Parsing [sent. 1965 len. 7]: Have you been over long ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1966 len. 3]: `` LONG ?
Parsing [sent. 1967 len. 7]: Well , I should say so !
Parsing [sent. 1968 len. 8]: Going on two YEARS , by geeminy !
Parsing [sent. 1969 len. 7]: Say , are you homesick ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1970 len. 11]: `` No , I ca n't say that I am .
Parsing [sent. 1971 len. 4]: Are you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1972 len. 8]: `` Oh , HELL , yes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1973 len. 5]: This with immense enthusiasm .
Parsing [sent. 1974 len. 49]: The Reverend shrunk a little , in his clothes , and we were aware , rather by instinct than otherwise , that he was throwing out signals of distress to us ; but we did not interfere or try to succor him , for we were quite happy .
Parsing [sent. 1975 len. 70]: The young fellow hooked his arm into the Reverend 's , now , with the confiding and grateful air of a waif who has been longing for a friend , and a sympathetic ear , and a chance to lisp once more the sweet accents of the mother-tongue -- and then he limbered up the muscles of his mouth and turned himself loose -- and with such a relish !
Parsing [sent. 1976 len. 20]: Some of his words were not Sunday-school words , so I am obliged to put blanks where they occur .
Parsing [sent. 1977 len. 4]: `` Yes indeedy !
Parsing [sent. 1978 len. 18]: If _ I _ ai n't an American there AI N'T any Americans , that 's all .
Parsing [sent. 1979 len. 32]: And when I heard you fellows gassing away in the good old American language , I 'm ------ if it was n't all I could do to keep from hugging you !
Parsing [sent. 1980 len. 47]: My tongue 's all warped with trying to curl it around these ------ forsaken wind-galled nine-jointed German words here ; now I TELL you it 's awful good to lay it over a Christian word once more and kind of let the old taste soak it .
Parsing [sent. 1981 len. 7]: I 'm from western New York .
Parsing [sent. 1982 len. 6]: My name is Cholley Adams .
Parsing [sent. 1983 len. 8]: I 'm a student , you know .
Parsing [sent. 1984 len. 7]: Been here going on two years .
Parsing [sent. 1985 len. 8]: I 'm learning to be a horse-doctor !
Parsing [sent. 1986 len. 48]: I LIKE that part of it , you know , but ------ these people , they wo n't learn a fellow in his own language , they make him learn in German ; so before I could tackle the horse-doctoring I had to tackle this miserable language .
Parsing [sent. 1987 len. 21]: `` First off , I thought it would certainly give me the botts , but I do n't mind now .
Parsing [sent. 1988 len. 24]: I 've got it where the hair 's short , I think ; and dontchuknow , they made me learn Latin , too .
Parsing [sent. 1989 len. 45]: Now between you and me , I would n't give a ------ for all the Latin that was ever jabbered ; and the first thing _ I _ calculate to do when I get through , is to just sit down and forget it .
Parsing [sent. 1990 len. 17]: ` Two n't take me long , and I do n't mind the time , anyway .
Parsing [sent. 1991 len. 6]: And I tell you what !
Parsing [sent. 1992 len. 13]: the difference between school-teaching over yonder and school-teaching over here -- sho !
Parsing [sent. 1993 len. 8]: WE do n't know anything about it !
Parsing [sent. 1994 len. 54]: Here you 've got to peg and peg and peg and there just ai n't any let-up -- and what you learn here , you 've got to KNOW , dontchuknow -- or else you 'll have one of these ------ spavined , spectacles , ring-boned , knock-kneed old professors in your hair .
Parsing [sent. 1995 len. 21]: I 've been here long ENOUGH , and I 'm getting blessed tired of it , mind I TELL you .
Parsing [sent. 1996 len. 68]: The old man wrote me that he was coming over in June , and said he 'd take me home in August , whether I was done with my education or not , but durn him , he did n't come ; never said why ; just sent me a hamper of Sunday-school books , and told me to be good , and hold on a while .
Parsing [sent. 1997 len. 57]: I do n't take to Sunday-school books , dontchuknow -- I do n't hanker after them when I can get pie -- but I READ them , anyway , because whatever the old man tells me to do , that 's the thing that I 'm a-going to DO , or tear something , you know .
Parsing [sent. 1998 len. 30]: I buckled in and read all those books , because he wanted me to ; but that kind of thing do n't excite ME , I like something HEARTY .
Parsing [sent. 1999 len. 6]: But I 'm awful homesick .
Parsing [sent. 2000 len. 62]: I 'm homesick from ear-socket to crupper , and from crupper to hock-joint ; but it ai n't any use , I 've got to stay here , till the old man drops the rag and give the word -- yes , SIR , right here in this ------ country I 've got to linger till the old man says COME !
Parsing [sent. 2001 len. 27]: -- and you bet your bottom dollar , Johnny , it AI N'T just as easy as it is for a cat to have twins ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2002 len. 17]: At the end of this profane and cordial explosion he fetched a prodigious `` WHOOSH ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2003 len. 79]: to relieve his lungs and make recognition of the heat , and then he straightway dived into his narrative again for `` Johnny 's '' benefit , beginning , `` Well , ------ it ai n't any use talking , some of those old American words DO have a kind of a bully swing to them ; a man can EXPRESS himself with 'em -- a man can get at what he wants to SAY , dontchuknow . ''
Parsing [sent. 2004 len. 110]: When we reached our hotel and it seemed that he was about to lose the Reverend , he showed so much sorrow , and begged so hard and so earnestly that the Reverend 's heart was not hard enough to hold out against the pleadings -- so he went away with the parent-honoring student , like a right Christian , and took supper with him in his lodgings , and sat in the surf-beat of his slang and profanity till near midnight , and then left him -- left him pretty well talked out , but grateful `` clear down to his frogs , '' as he expressed it .
Parsing [sent. 2005 len. 37]: The Reverend said it had transpired during the interview that `` Cholley '' Adams 's father was an extensive dealer in horses in western New York ; this accounted for Cholley 's choice of a profession .
Parsing [sent. 2006 len. 39]: The Reverend brought away a pretty high opinion of Cholley as a manly young fellow , with stuff in him for a useful citizen ; he considered him rather a rough gem , but a gem , nevertheless .
Parsing [sent. 2007 len. 33]: CHAPTER XXI -LSB- Insolent Shopkeepers and Gabbling Americans -RSB- Baden-Baden sits in the lap of the hills , and the natural and artificial beauties of the surroundings are combined effectively and charmingly .
Parsing [sent. 2008 len. 34]: The level strip of ground which stretches through and beyond the town is laid out in handsome pleasure grounds , shaded by noble trees and adorned at intervals with lofty and sparkling fountain-jets .
Parsing [sent. 2009 len. 59]: Thrice a day a fine band makes music in the public promenade before the Conversation House , and in the afternoon and evening that locality is populous with fashionably dressed people of both sexes , who march back and forth past the great music-stand and look very much bored , though they make a show of feeling otherwise .
Parsing [sent. 2010 len. 10]: It seems like a rather aimless and stupid existence .
Parsing [sent. 2011 len. 34]: A good many of these people are there for a real purpose , however ; they are racked with rheumatism , and they are there to stew it out in the hot baths .
Parsing [sent. 2012 len. 24]: These invalids looked melancholy enough , limping about on their canes and crutches , and apparently brooding over all sorts of cheerless things .
Parsing [sent. 2013 len. 17]: People say that Germany , with her damp stone houses , is the home of rheumatism .
Parsing [sent. 2014 len. 25]: If that is so , Providence must have foreseen that it would be so , and therefore filled the land with the healing baths .
Parsing [sent. 2015 len. 14]: Perhaps no other country is so generously supplied with medicinal springs as Germany .
Parsing [sent. 2016 len. 31]: Some of these baths are good for one ailment , some for another ; and again , peculiar ailments are conquered by combining the individual virtues of several different baths .
Parsing [sent. 2017 len. 32]: For instance , for some forms of disease , the patient drinks the native hot water of Baden-Baden , with a spoonful of salt from the Carlsbad springs dissolved in it .
Parsing [sent. 2018 len. 11]: That is not a dose to be forgotten right away .
Parsing [sent. 2019 len. 64]: They do n't SELL this hot water ; no , you go into the great Trinkhalle , and stand around , first on one foot and then on the other , while two or three young girls sit pottering at some sort of ladylike sewing-work in your neighborhood and ca n't seem to see you -- polite as three-dollar clerks in government offices .
Parsing [sent. 2020 len. 107]: By and by one of these rises painfully , and `` stretches '' -- stretches fists and body heavenward till she raises her heels from the floor , at the same time refreshing herself with a yawn of such comprehensiveness that the bulk of her face disappears behind her upper lip and one is able to see how she is constructed inside -- then she slowly closes her cavern , brings down her fists and her heels , comes languidly forward , contemplates you contemptuously , draws you a glass of hot water and sets it down where you can get it by reaching for it .
Parsing [sent. 2021 len. 11]: You take it and say : `` How much ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2022 len. 25]: -- and she returns you , with elaborate indifference , a beggar 's answer : `` NACH BELIEBE '' -LRB- what you please . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 2023 len. 41]: This thing of using the common beggar 's trick and the common beggar 's shibboleth to put you on your liberality when you were expecting a simple straightforward commercial transaction , adds a little to your prospering sense of irritation .
Parsing [sent. 2024 len. 14]: You ignore her reply , and ask again : `` How much ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2025 len. 14]: -- and she calmly , indifferently , repeats : `` NACH BELIEBE . ''
Parsing [sent. 2026 len. 36]: You are getting angry , but you are trying not to show it ; you resolve to keep on asking your question till she changes her answer , or at least her annoyingly indifferent manner .
Parsing [sent. 2027 len. 51]: Therefore , if your case be like mine , you two fools stand there , and without perceptible emotion of any kind , or any emphasis on any syllable , you look blandly into each other 's eyes , and hold the following idiotic conversation : `` How much ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2028 len. 5]: `` NACH BELIEBE . ''
Parsing [sent. 2029 len. 5]: `` How much ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2030 len. 5]: `` NACH BELIEBE . ''
Parsing [sent. 2031 len. 5]: `` How much ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2032 len. 5]: `` NACH BELIEBE . ''
Parsing [sent. 2033 len. 5]: `` How much ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2034 len. 5]: `` NACH BELIEBE . ''
Parsing [sent. 2035 len. 5]: `` How much ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2036 len. 5]: `` NACH BELIEBE . ''
Parsing [sent. 2037 len. 5]: `` How much ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2038 len. 5]: `` NACH BELIEBE . ''
Parsing [sent. 2039 len. 36]: I do not know what another person would have done , but at this point I gave up ; that cast-iron indifference , that tranquil contemptuousness , conquered me , and I struck my colors .
Parsing [sent. 2040 len. 72]: Now I knew she was used to receiving about a penny from manly people who care nothing about the opinions of scullery-maids , and about tuppence from moral cowards ; but I laid a silver twenty-five cent piece within her reach and tried to shrivel her up with this sarcastic speech : `` If it is n't enough , will you stoop sufficiently from your official dignity to say so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2041 len. 5]: She did not shrivel .
Parsing [sent. 2042 len. 18]: Without deigning to look at me at all , she languidly lifted the coin and bit it !
Parsing [sent. 2043 len. 8]: -- to see if it was good .
Parsing [sent. 2044 len. 26]: Then she turned her back and placidly waddled to her former roost again , tossing the money into an open till as she went along .
Parsing [sent. 2045 len. 10]: She was victor to the last , you see .
Parsing [sent. 2046 len. 28]: I have enlarged upon the ways of this girl because they are typical ; her manners are the manners of a goodly number of the Baden-Baden shopkeepers .
Parsing [sent. 2047 len. 21]: The shopkeeper there swindles you if he can , and insults you whether he succeeds in swindling you or not .
Parsing [sent. 2048 len. 14]: The keepers of baths also take great and patient pains to insult you .
Parsing [sent. 2049 len. 60]: The frowsy woman who sat at the desk in the lobby of the great Friederichsbad and sold bath tickets , not only insulted me twice every day , with rigid fidelity to her great trust , but she took trouble enough to cheat me out of a shilling , one day , to have fairly entitled her to ten .
Parsing [sent. 2050 len. 13]: Baden-Baden 's splendid gamblers are gone , only her microscopic knaves remain .
Parsing [sent. 2051 len. 29]: An English gentleman who had been living there several years , said : `` If you could disguise your nationality , you would not find any insolence here .
Parsing [sent. 2052 len. 26]: These shopkeepers detest the English and despise the Americans ; they are rude to both , more especially to ladies of your nationality and mine .
Parsing [sent. 2053 len. 44]: If these go shopping without a gentleman or a man-servant , they are tolerably sure to be subjected to petty insolences -- insolences of manner and tone , rather than word , though words that are hard to bear are not always wanting .
Parsing [sent. 2054 len. 33]: I know of an instance where a shopkeeper tossed a coin back to an American lady with the remark , snappishly uttered , ` We do n't take French money here . '
Parsing [sent. 2055 len. 31]: And I know of a case where an English lady said to one of these shopkeepers , ` Do n't you think you ask too much for this article ? '
Parsing [sent. 2056 len. 19]: and he replied with the question , ` Do you think you are obliged to buy it ? '
Parsing [sent. 2057 len. 12]: However , these people are not impolite to Russians or Germans .
Parsing [sent. 2058 len. 20]: And as to rank , they worship that , for they have long been used to generals and nobles .
Parsing [sent. 2059 len. 26]: If you wish to see what abysses servility can descend , present yourself before a Baden-Baden shopkeeper in the character of a Russian prince . ''
Parsing [sent. 2060 len. 23]: It is an inane town , filled with sham , and petty fraud , and snobbery , but the baths are good .
Parsing [sent. 2061 len. 14]: I spoke with many people , and they were all agreed in that .
Parsing [sent. 2062 len. 31]: I had the twinges of rheumatism unceasingly during three years , but the last one departed after a fortnight 's bathing there , and I have never had one since .
Parsing [sent. 2063 len. 10]: I fully believe I left my rheumatism in Baden-Baden .
Parsing [sent. 2064 len. 6]: Baden-Baden is welcome to it .
Parsing [sent. 2065 len. 13]: It was little , but it was all I had to give .
Parsing [sent. 2066 len. 19]: I would have preferred to leave something that was catching , but it was not in my power .
Parsing [sent. 2067 len. 24]: There are several hot springs there , and during two thousand years they have poured forth a never-diminishing abundance of the healing water .
Parsing [sent. 2068 len. 25]: This water is conducted in pipe to the numerous bath-houses , and is reduced to an endurable temperature by the addition of cold water .
Parsing [sent. 2069 len. 59]: The new Friederichsbad is a very large and beautiful building , and in it one may have any sort of bath that has ever been invented , and with all the additions of herbs and drugs that his ailment may need or that the physician of the establishment may consider a useful thing to put into the water .
Parsing [sent. 2070 len. 83]: You go there , enter the great door , get a bow graduated to your style and clothes from the gorgeous portier , and a bath ticket and an insult from the frowsy woman for a quarter ; she strikes a bell and a serving-man conducts you down a long hall and shuts you into a commodious room which has a washstand , a mirror , a bootjack , and a sofa in it , and there you undress at your leisure .
Parsing [sent. 2071 len. 45]: The room is divided by a great curtain ; you draw this curtain aside , and find a large white marble bathtub , with its rim sunk to the level of the floor , and with three white marble steps leading down to it .
Parsing [sent. 2072 len. 27]: This tub is full of water which is as clear as crystal , and is tempered to 28 degrees Re'aumur -LRB- about 95 degrees Fahrenheit -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 2073 len. 23]: Sunk into the floor , by the tub , is a covered copper box which contains some warm towels and a sheet .
Parsing [sent. 2074 len. 18]: You look fully as white as an angel when you are stretched out in that limpid bath .
Parsing [sent. 2075 len. 29]: You remain in it ten minutes , the first time , and afterward increase the duration from day to day , till you reach twenty-five or thirty minutes .
Parsing [sent. 2076 len. 4]: There you stop .
Parsing [sent. 2077 len. 38]: The appointments of the place are so luxurious , the benefit so marked , the price so moderate , and the insults so sure , that you very soon find yourself adoring the Friederichsbad and infesting it .
Parsing [sent. 2078 len. 53]: We had a plain , simple , unpretending , good hotel , in Baden-Baden -- the Hôtel de France -- and alongside my room I had a giggling , cackling , chattering family who always went to bed just two hours after me and always got up two hours ahead of me .
Parsing [sent. 2079 len. 24]: But this is common in German hotels ; the people generally go to bed long after eleven and get up long before eight .
Parsing [sent. 2080 len. 43]: The partitions convey sound like a drum-head , and everybody knows it ; but no matter , a German family who are all kindness and consideration in the daytime make apparently no effort to moderate their noises for your benefit at night .
Parsing [sent. 2081 len. 20]: They will sing , laugh , and talk loudly , and bang furniture around in a most pitiless way .
Parsing [sent. 2082 len. 42]: If you knock on your wall appealingly , they will quiet down and discuss the matter softly among themselves for a moment -- then , like the mice , they fall to persecuting you again , and as vigorously as before .
Parsing [sent. 2083 len. 13]: They keep cruelly late and early hours , for such noisy folk .
Parsing [sent. 2084 len. 35]: Of course , when one begins to find fault with foreign people 's ways , he is very likely to get a reminder to look nearer home , before he gets far with it .
Parsing [sent. 2085 len. 37]: I open my note-book to see if I can find some more information of a valuable nature about Baden-Baden , and the first thing I fall upon is this : `` BADEN-BADEN -LRB- no date -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 2086 len. 9]: Lot of vociferous Americans at breakfast this morning .
Parsing [sent. 2087 len. 11]: Talking AT everybody , while pretending to talk among themselves .
Parsing [sent. 2088 len. 7]: On their first travels , manifestly .
Parsing [sent. 2089 len. 3]: Showing off .
Parsing [sent. 2090 len. 15]: The usual signs -- airy , easy-going references to grand distances and foreign places .
Parsing [sent. 2091 len. 29]: ` Well GOOD-by , old fellow -- if I do n't run across you in Italy , you hunt me up in London before you sail . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 2092 len. 54]: The next item which I find in my note-book is this one : `` The fact that a band of 6,000 Indians are now murdering our frontiersmen at their impudent leisure , and that we are only able to send 1,200 soldiers against them , is utilized here to discourage emigration to America .
Parsing [sent. 2093 len. 12]: The common people think the Indians are in New Jersey . ''
Parsing [sent. 2094 len. 22]: This is a new and peculiar argument against keeping our army down to a ridiculous figure in the matter of numbers .
Parsing [sent. 2095 len. 9]: It is rather a striking one , too .
Parsing [sent. 2096 len. 33]: I have not distorted the truth in saying that the facts in the above item , about the army and the Indians , are made use of to discourage emigration to America .
Parsing [sent. 2097 len. 35]: That the common people should be rather foggy in their geography , and foggy as to the location of the Indians , is a matter for amusement , maybe , but not of surprise .
Parsing [sent. 2098 len. 29]: There is an interesting old cemetery in Baden-Baden , and we spent several pleasant hours in wandering through it and spelling out the inscriptions on the aged tombstones .
Parsing [sent. 2099 len. 39]: Apparently after a man has laid there a century or two , and has had a good many people buried on top of him , it is considered that his tombstone is not needed by him any longer .
Parsing [sent. 2100 len. 27]: I judge so from the fact that hundreds of old gravestones have been removed from the graves and placed against the inner walls of the cemetery .
Parsing [sent. 2101 len. 9]: What artists they had in the old times !
Parsing [sent. 2102 len. 33]: They chiseled angels and cherubs and devils and skeletons on the tombstones in the most lavish and generous way -- as to supply -- but curiously grotesque and outlandish as to form .
Parsing [sent. 2103 len. 24]: It is not always easy to tell which of the figures belong among the blest and which of them among the opposite party .
Parsing [sent. 2104 len. 35]: But there was an inscription , in French , on one of those old stones , which was quaint and pretty , and was plainly not the work of any other than a poet .
Parsing [sent. 2105 len. 27]: It was to this effect : Here Reposes in God , Caroline de Clery , a Religieuse of St. Denis aged 83 years -- and blind .
Parsing [sent. 2106 len. 36]: The light was restored to her in Baden the 5th of January , 1839 We made several excursions on foot to the neighboring villages , over winding and beautiful roads and through enchanting woodland scenery .
Parsing [sent. 2107 len. 16]: The woods and roads were similar to those at Heidelberg , but not so bewitching .
Parsing [sent. 2108 len. 19]: I suppose that roads and woods which are up to the Heidelberg mark are rare in the world .
Parsing [sent. 2109 len. 17]: Once we wandered clear away to La Favorita Palace , which is several miles from Baden-Baden .
Parsing [sent. 2110 len. 14]: The grounds about the palace were fine ; the palace was a curiosity .
Parsing [sent. 2111 len. 19]: It was built by a Margravine in 1725 , and remains as she left it at her death .
Parsing [sent. 2112 len. 19]: We wandered through a great many of its rooms , and they all had striking peculiarities of decoration .
Parsing [sent. 2113 len. 31]: For instance , the walls of one room were pretty completely covered with small pictures of the Margravine in all conceivable varieties of fanciful costumes , some of them male .
Parsing [sent. 2114 len. 15]: The walls of another room were covered with grotesquely and elaborately figured hand-wrought tapestry .
Parsing [sent. 2115 len. 37]: The musty ancient beds remained in the chambers , and their quilts and curtains and canopies were decorated with curious handwork , and the walls and ceilings frescoed with historical and mythological scenes in glaring colors .
Parsing [sent. 2116 len. 19]: There was enough crazy and rotten rubbish in the building to make a true brick-a-bracker green with envy .
Parsing [sent. 2117 len. 20]: A painting in the dining-hall verged upon the indelicate -- but then the Margravine was herself a trifle indelicate .
Parsing [sent. 2118 len. 30]: It is in every way a wildly and picturesquely decorated house , and brimful of interest as a reflection of the character and tastes of that rude bygone time .
Parsing [sent. 2119 len. 33]: In the grounds , a few rods from the palace , stands the Margravine 's chapel , just as she left it -- a coarse wooden structure , wholly barren of ornament .
Parsing [sent. 2120 len. 46]: It is said that the Margravine would give herself up to debauchery and exceedingly fast living for several months at a time , and then retire to this miserable wooden den and spend a few months in repenting and getting ready for another good time .
Parsing [sent. 2121 len. 25]: She was a devoted Catholic , and was perhaps quite a model sort of a Christian as Christians went then , in high life .
Parsing [sent. 2122 len. 35]: Tradition says she spent the last two years of her life in the strange den I have been speaking of , after having indulged herself in one final , triumphant , and satisfying spree .
Parsing [sent. 2123 len. 23]: She shut herself up there , without company , and without even a servant , and so abjured and forsook the world .
Parsing [sent. 2124 len. 37]: In her little bit of a kitchen she did her own cooking ; she wore a hair shirt next the skin , and castigated herself with whips -- these aids to grace are exhibited there yet .
Parsing [sent. 2125 len. 32]: She prayed and told her beads , in another little room , before a waxen Virgin niched in a little box against the wall ; she bedded herself like a slave .
Parsing [sent. 2126 len. 42]: In another small room is an unpainted wooden table , and behind it sit half-life-size waxen figures of the Holy Family , made by the very worst artist that ever lived , perhaps , and clothed in gaudy , flimsy drapery .
Parsing [sent. 2127 len. 20]: -LSB- 1 -RSB- The margravine used to bring her meals to this table and DINE WITH THE HOLY FAMILY .
Parsing [sent. 2128 len. 6]: What an idea that was !
Parsing [sent. 2129 len. 9]: What a grisly spectacle it must have been !
Parsing [sent. 2130 len. 71]: Imagine it : Those rigid , shock-headed figures , with corpsy complexions and fish glass eyes , occupying one side of the table in the constrained attitudes and dead fixedness that distinguish all men that are born of wax , and this wrinkled , smoldering old fire-eater occupying the other side , mumbling her prayers and munching her sausages in the ghostly stillness and shadowy indistinctness of a winter twilight .
Parsing [sent. 2131 len. 11]: It makes one feel crawly even to think of it .
Parsing [sent. 2132 len. 17]: -LSB- 1 -RSB- The Savior was represented as a lad of about fifteen years of age .
Parsing [sent. 2133 len. 7]: This figure had lost one eye .
Parsing [sent. 2134 len. 32]: In this sordid place , and clothed , bedded , and fed like a pauper , this strange princess lived and worshiped during two years , and in it she died .
Parsing [sent. 2135 len. 36]: Two or three hundred years ago , this would have made the poor den holy ground ; and the church would have set up a miracle-factory there and made plenty of money out of it .
Parsing [sent. 2136 len. 18]: The den could be moved into some portions of France and made a good property even now .

Parsing [sent. 2202 len. 9]: We were on foot most of the time .
Parsing [sent. 2203 len. 17]: One can not describe those noble woods , nor the feeling with which they inspire him .
Parsing [sent. 2204 len. 56]: A feature of the feeling , however , is a deep sense of contentment ; another feature of it is a buoyant , boyish gladness ; and a third and very conspicuous feature of it is one 's sense of the remoteness of the work-day world and his entire emancipation from it and its affairs .
Parsing [sent. 2205 len. 27]: Those woods stretch unbroken over a vast region ; and everywhere they are such dense woods , and so still , and so piney and fragrant .
Parsing [sent. 2206 len. 57]: The stems of the trees are trim and straight , and in many places all the ground is hidden for miles under a thick cushion of moss of a vivid green color , with not a decayed or ragged spot in its surface , and not a fallen leaf or twig to mar its immaculate tidiness .
Parsing [sent. 2207 len. 40]: A rich cathedral gloom pervades the pillared aisles ; so the stray flecks of sunlight that strike a trunk here and a bough yonder are strongly accented , and when they strike the moss they fairly seem to burn .
Parsing [sent. 2208 len. 63]: But the weirdest effect , and the most enchanting is that produced by the diffused light of the low afternoon sun ; no single ray is able to pierce its way in , then , but the diffused light takes color from moss and foliage , and pervades the place like a faint , green-tinted mist , the theatrical fire of fairyland .
Parsing [sent. 2209 len. 21]: The suggestion of mystery and the supernatural which haunts the forest at all times is intensified by this unearthly glow .
Parsing [sent. 2210 len. 18]: We found the Black Forest farmhouses and villages all that the Black Forest stories have pictured them .
Parsing [sent. 2211 len. 27]: The first genuine specimen which we came upon was the mansion of a rich farmer and member of the Common Council of the parish or district .
Parsing [sent. 2212 len. 18]: He was an important personage in the land and so was his wife also , of course .
Parsing [sent. 2213 len. 34]: His daughter was the `` catch '' of the region , and she may be already entering into immortality as the heroine of one of Auerbach 's novels , for all I know .
Parsing [sent. 2214 len. 61]: We shall see , for if he puts her in I shall recognize her by her Black Forest clothes , and her burned complexion , her plump figure , her fat hands , her dull expression , her gentle spirit , her generous feet , her bonnetless head , and the plaited tails of hemp-colored hair hanging down her back .
Parsing [sent. 2215 len. 52]: The house was big enough for a hotel ; it was a hundred feet long and fifty wide , and ten feet high , from ground to eaves ; but from the eaves to the comb of the mighty roof was as much as forty feet , or maybe even more .
Parsing [sent. 2216 len. 38]: This roof was of ancient mud-colored straw thatch a foot thick , and was covered all over , except in a few trifling spots , with a thriving and luxurious growth of green vegetation , mainly moss .
Parsing [sent. 2217 len. 21]: The mossless spots were places where repairs had been made by the insertion of bright new masses of yellow straw .
Parsing [sent. 2218 len. 12]: The eaves projected far down , like sheltering , hospitable wings .
Parsing [sent. 2219 len. 41]: Across the gable that fronted the road , and about ten feet above the ground , ran a narrow porch , with a wooden railing ; a row of small windows filled with very small panes looked upon the porch .
Parsing [sent. 2220 len. 20]: Above were two or three other little windows , one clear up under the sharp apex of the roof .
Parsing [sent. 2221 len. 11]: Before the ground-floor door was a huge pile of manure .
Parsing [sent. 2222 len. 25]: The door of the second-story room on the side of the house was open , and occupied by the rear elevation of a cow .
Parsing [sent. 2223 len. 6]: Was this probably the drawing-room ?
Parsing [sent. 2224 len. 37]: All of the front half of the house from the ground up seemed to be occupied by the people , the cows , and the chickens , and all the rear half by draught-animals and hay .
Parsing [sent. 2225 len. 17]: But the chief feature , all around this house , was the big heaps of manure .
Parsing [sent. 2226 len. 11]: We became very familiar with the fertilizer in the Forest .
Parsing [sent. 2227 len. 22]: We fell unconsciously into the habit of judging of a man 's station in life by this outward and eloquent sign .
Parsing [sent. 2228 len. 16]: Sometimes we said , `` Here is a poor devil , this is manifest . ''
Parsing [sent. 2229 len. 17]: When we saw a stately accumulation , we said , `` Here is a banker . ''
Parsing [sent. 2230 len. 24]: When we encountered a country-seat surrounded by an Alpine pomp of manure , we said , `` Doubtless a duke lives here . ''
Parsing [sent. 2231 len. 16]: The importance of this feature has not been properly magnified in the Black Forest stories .
Parsing [sent. 2232 len. 54]: Manure is evidently the Black-Forester 's main treasure -- his coin , his jewel , his pride , his Old Master , his ceramics , his bric-a-brac , his darling , his title to public consideration , envy , veneration , and his first solicitude when he gets ready to make his will .
Parsing [sent. 2233 len. 33]: The true Black Forest novel , if it is ever written , will be skeletoned somewhat in this way : SKELETON FOR A BLACK FOREST NOVEL Rich old farmer , named Huss .
Parsing [sent. 2234 len. 15]: Has inherited great wealth of manure , and by diligence has added to it .
Parsing [sent. 2235 len. 6]: It is double-starred in Baedeker .
Parsing [sent. 2236 len. 13]: -LSB- 1 -RSB- The Black forest artist paints it -- his masterpiece .
Parsing [sent. 2237 len. 7]: The king comes to see it .
Parsing [sent. 2238 len. 7]: Gretchen Huss , daughter and heiress .
Parsing [sent. 2239 len. 20]: Paul Hoch , young neighbor , suitor for Gretchen 's hand -- ostensibly ; he really wants the manure .
Parsing [sent. 2240 len. 39]: Hoch has a good many cart-loads of the Black Forest currency himself , and therefore is a good catch ; but he is sordid , mean , and without sentiment , whereas Gretchen is all sentiment and poetry .
Parsing [sent. 2241 len. 21]: Hans Schmidt , young neighbor , full of sentiment , full of poetry , loves Gretchen , Gretchen loves him .
Parsing [sent. 2242 len. 6]: But he has no manure .
Parsing [sent. 2243 len. 8]: Old Huss forbids him in the house .
Parsing [sent. 2244 len. 34]: His heart breaks , he goes away to die in the woods , far from the cruel world -- for he says , bitterly , `` What is man , without manure ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2245 len. 2]: 1 .
Parsing [sent. 2246 len. 23]: When Baedeker 's guide-books mention a thing and put two stars -LRB- ** -RRB- after it , it means well worth visiting .
Parsing [sent. 2247 len. 8]: M.T. -LSB- Interval of six months . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 2248 len. 27]: Paul Hoch comes to old Huss and says , `` I am at last as rich as you required -- come and view the pile . ''
Parsing [sent. 2249 len. 23]: Old Huss views it and says , `` It is sufficient -- take her and be happy , '' -- meaning Gretchen .
Parsing [sent. 2250 len. 7]: -LSB- Interval of two weeks . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 2251 len. 9]: Wedding party assembled in old Huss 's drawing-room .
Parsing [sent. 2252 len. 12]: Hoch placid and content , Gretchen weeping over her hard fate .
Parsing [sent. 2253 len. 7]: Enter old Huss 's head bookkeeper .
Parsing [sent. 2254 len. 50]: Huss says fiercely , `` I gave you three weeks to find out why your books do n't balance , and to prove that you are not a defaulter ; the time is up -- find me the missing property or you go to prison as a thief . ''
Parsing [sent. 2255 len. 9]: Bookkeeper : `` I have found it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2256 len. 4]: `` Where ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2257 len. 14]: Bookkeeper -LRB- sternly -- tragically -RRB- : `` In the bridegroom 's pile !
Parsing [sent. 2258 len. 12]: -- behold the thief -- see him blench and tremble ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2259 len. 4]: -LSB- Sensation . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 2260 len. 9]: Paul Hoch : `` Lost , lost ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2261 len. 12]: -- falls over the cow in a swoon and is handcuffed .
Parsing [sent. 2262 len. 6]: Gretchen : `` Saved ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2263 len. 27]: Falls over the calf in a swoon of joy , but is caught in the arms of Hans Schmidt , who springs in at that moment .
Parsing [sent. 2264 len. 11]: Old Huss : `` What , you here , varlet ?
Parsing [sent. 2265 len. 9]: Unhand the maid and quit the place . ''
Parsing [sent. 2266 len. 12]: Hans -LRB- still supporting the insensible girl -RRB- : `` Never !
Parsing [sent. 2267 len. 18]: Cruel old man , know that I come with claims which even you can not despise . ''
Parsing [sent. 2268 len. 7]: Huss : `` What , YOU ?
Parsing [sent. 2269 len. 4]: name them . ''
Parsing [sent. 2270 len. 6]: Hans : `` Listen then .
Parsing [sent. 2271 len. 27]: The world has forsaken me , I forsook the world , I wandered in the solitude of the forest , longing for death but finding none .
Parsing [sent. 2272 len. 20]: I fed upon roots , and in my bitterness I dug for the bitterest , loathing the sweeter kind .
Parsing [sent. 2273 len. 12]: Digging , three days agone , I struck a manure mine !
Parsing [sent. 2274 len. 12]: -- a Golconda , a limitless Bonanza , of solid manure !
Parsing [sent. 2275 len. 14]: I can buy you ALL , and have mountain ranges of manure left !
Parsing [sent. 2276 len. 9]: Ha-ha , NOW thou smilest a smile ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2277 len. 5]: -LSB- Immense sensation . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 2278 len. 7]: Exhibition of specimens from the mine .
Parsing [sent. 2279 len. 24]: Old Huss -LRB- enthusiastically -RRB- : `` Wake her up , shake her up , noble young man , she is yours ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2280 len. 22]: Wedding takes place on the spot ; bookkeeper restored to his office and emoluments ; Paul Hoch led off to jail .
Parsing [sent. 2281 len. 36]: The Bonanza king of the Black Forest lives to a good old age , blessed with the love of his wife and of his twenty-seven children , and the still sweeter envy of everybody around .
Parsing [sent. 2282 len. 36]: We took our noon meal of fried trout one day at the Plow Inn , in a very pretty village -LRB- Ottenhoefen -RRB- , and then went into the public room to rest and smoke .
Parsing [sent. 2283 len. 14]: There we found nine or ten Black Forest grandees assembled around a table .
Parsing [sent. 2284 len. 9]: They were the Common Council of the parish .
Parsing [sent. 2285 len. 31]: They had gathered there at eight o'clock that morning to elect a new member , and they had now been drinking beer four hours at the new member 's expense .
Parsing [sent. 2286 len. 66]: They were men of fifty or sixty years of age , with grave good-natured faces , and were all dressed in the costume made familiar to us by the Black Forest stories ; broad , round-topped black felt hats with the brims curled up all round ; long red waistcoats with large metal buttons , black alpaca coats with the waists up between the shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 2287 len. 51]: There were no speeches , there was but little talk , there were no frivolities ; the Council filled themselves gradually , steadily , but surely , with beer , and conducted themselves with sedate decorum , as became men of position , men of influence , men of manure .
Parsing [sent. 2288 len. 38]: We had a hot afternoon tramp up the valley , along the grassy bank of a rushing stream of clear water , past farmhouses , water-mills , and no end of wayside crucifixes and saints and Virgins .
Parsing [sent. 2289 len. 29]: These crucifixes , etc. , are set up in memory of departed friends , by survivors , and are almost as frequent as telegraph-poles are in other lands .
Parsing [sent. 2290 len. 34]: We followed the carriage-road , and had our usual luck ; we traveled under a beating sun , and always saw the shade leave the shady places before we could get to them .
Parsing [sent. 2291 len. 20]: In all our wanderings we seldom managed to strike a piece of road at its time for being shady .
Parsing [sent. 2292 len. 48]: We had a particularly hot time of it on that particular afternoon , and with no comfort but what we could get out of the fact that the peasants at work away up on the steep mountainsides above our heads were even worse off than we were .
Parsing [sent. 2293 len. 45]: By and by it became impossible to endure the intolerable glare and heat any longer ; so we struck across the ravine and entered the deep cool twilight of the forest , to hunt for what the guide-book called the `` old road . ''
Parsing [sent. 2294 len. 33]: We found an old road , and it proved eventually to be the right one , though we followed it at the time with the conviction that it was the wrong one .
Parsing [sent. 2295 len. 40]: If it was the wrong one there could be no use in hurrying ; therefore we did not hurry , but sat down frequently on the soft moss and enjoyed the restful quiet and shade of the forest solitudes .
Parsing [sent. 2296 len. 32]: There had been distractions in the carriage-road -- school-children , peasants , wagons , troops of pedestrianizing students from all over Germany -- but we had the old road to ourselves .
Parsing [sent. 2297 len. 17]: Now and then , while we rested , we watched the laborious ant at his work .
Parsing [sent. 2298 len. 16]: I found nothing new in him -- certainly nothing to change my opinion of him .
Parsing [sent. 2299 len. 19]: It seems to me that in the matter of intellect the ant must be a strangely overrated bird .
Parsing [sent. 2300 len. 43]: During many summers , now , I have watched him , when I ought to have been in better business , and I have not yet come across a living ant that seemed to have any more sense than a dead one .
Parsing [sent. 2301 len. 37]: I refer to the ordinary ant , of course ; I have had no experience of those wonderful Swiss and African ones which vote , keep drilled armies , hold slaves , and dispute about religion .
Parsing [sent. 2302 len. 24]: Those particular ants may be all that the naturalist paints them , but I am persuaded that the average ant is a sham .
Parsing [sent. 2303 len. 33]: I admit his industry , of course ; he is the hardest-working creature in the world -- when anybody is looking -- but his leather-headedness is the point I make against him .
Parsing [sent. 2304 len. 17]: He goes out foraging , he makes a capture , and then what does he do ?
Parsing [sent. 2305 len. 3]: Go home ?
Parsing [sent. 2306 len. 8]: No -- he goes anywhere but home .
Parsing [sent. 2307 len. 8]: He does n't know where home is .
Parsing [sent. 2308 len. 18]: His home may be only three feet away -- no matter , he ca n't find it .
Parsing [sent. 2309 len. 306]: He makes his capture , as I have said ; it is generally something which can be of no sort of use to himself or anybody else ; it is usually seven times bigger than it ought to be ; he hunts out the awkwardest place to take hold of it ; he lifts it bodily up in the air by main force , and starts ; not toward home , but in the opposite direction ; not calmly and wisely , but with a frantic haste which is wasteful of his strength ; he fetches up against a pebble , and instead of going around it , he climbs over it backward dragging his booty after him , tumbles down on the other side , jumps up in a passion , kicks the dust off his clothes , moistens his hands , grabs his property viciously , yanks it this way , then that , shoves it ahead of him a moment , turns tail and lugs it after him another moment , gets madder and madder , then presently hoists it into the air and goes tearing away in an entirely new direction ; comes to a weed ; it never occurs to him to go around it ; no , he must climb it ; and he does climb it , dragging his worthless property to the top -- which is as bright a thing to do as it would be for me to carry a sack of flour from Heidelberg to Paris by way of Strasburg steeple ; when he gets up there he finds that that is not the place ; takes a cursory glance at the scenery and either climbs down again or tumbles down , and starts off once more -- as usual , in a new direction .
Parsing [sent. 2310 len. 50]: At the end of half an hour , he fetches up within six inches of the place he started from and lays his burden down ; meantime he has been over all the ground for two yards around , and climbed all the weeds and pebbles he came across .
Parsing [sent. 2311 len. 27]: Now he wipes the sweat from his brow , strokes his limbs , and then marches aimlessly off , in as violently a hurry as ever .
Parsing [sent. 2312 len. 50]: He does not remember to have ever seen it before ; he looks around to see which is not the way home , grabs his bundle and starts ; he goes through the same adventures he had before ; finally stops to rest , and a friend comes along .
Parsing [sent. 2313 len. 24]: Evidently the friend remarks that a last year 's grasshopper leg is a very noble acquisition , and inquires where he got it .
Parsing [sent. 2314 len. 24]: Evidently the proprietor does not remember exactly where he did get it , but thinks he got it `` around here somewhere . ''
Parsing [sent. 2315 len. 11]: Evidently the friend contracts to help him freight it home .
Parsing [sent. 2316 len. 35]: Then , with a judgment peculiarly antic -LRB- pun not intended -RRB- , they take hold of opposite ends of that grasshopper leg and begin to tug with all their might in opposite directions .
Parsing [sent. 2317 len. 9]: Presently they take a rest and confer together .
Parsing [sent. 2318 len. 14]: They decide that something is wrong , they ca n't make out what .
Parsing [sent. 2319 len. 11]: Then they go at it again , just as before .
Parsing [sent. 2320 len. 3]: Same result .
Parsing [sent. 2321 len. 4]: Mutual recriminations follow .
Parsing [sent. 2322 len. 10]: Evidently each accuses the other of being an obstructionist .
Parsing [sent. 2323 len. 38]: They lock themselves together and chew each other 's jaws for a while ; then they roll and tumble on the ground till one loses a horn or a leg and has to haul off for repairs .
Parsing [sent. 2324 len. 44]: They make up and go to work again in the same old insane way , but the crippled ant is at a disadvantage ; tug as he may , the other one drags off the booty and him at the end of it .
Parsing [sent. 2325 len. 23]: Instead of giving up , he hangs on , and gets his shins bruised against every obstruction that comes in the way .
Parsing [sent. 2326 len. 100]: By and by , when that grasshopper leg has been dragged all over the same old ground once more , it is finally dumped at about the spot where it originally lay , the two perspiring ants inspect it thoughtfully and decide that dried grasshopper legs are a poor sort of property after all , and then each starts off in a different direction to see if he ca n't find an old nail or something else that is heavy enough to afford entertainment and at the same time valueless enough to make an ant want to own it .
Parsing [sent. 2327 len. 34]: There in the Black Forest , on the mountainside , I saw an ant go through with such a performance as this with a dead spider of fully ten times his own weight .
Parsing [sent. 2328 len. 14]: The spider was not quite dead , but too far gone to resist .
Parsing [sent. 2329 len. 11]: He had a round body the size of a pea .
Parsing [sent. 2330 len. 110]: The little ant -- observing that I was noticing -- turned him on his back , sunk his fangs into his throat , lifted him into the air and started vigorously off with him , stumbling over little pebbles , stepping on the spider 's legs and tripping himself up , dragging him backward , shoving him bodily ahead , dragging him up stones six inches high instead of going around them , climbing weeds twenty times his own height and jumping from their summits -- and finally leaving him in the middle of the road to be confiscated by any other fool of an ant that wanted him .
Parsing [sent. 2331 len. 131]: I measured the ground which this ass traversed , and arrived at the conclusion that what he had accomplished inside of twenty minutes would constitute some such job as this -- relatively speaking -- for a man ; to wit : to strap two eight-hundred-pound horses together , carry them eighteen hundred feet , mainly over -LRB- not around -RRB- boulders averaging six feet high , and in the course of the journey climb up and jump from the top of one precipice like Niagara , and three steeples , each a hundred and twenty feet high ; and then put the horses down , in an exposed place , without anybody to watch them , and go off to indulge in some other idiotic miracle for vanity 's sake .
Parsing [sent. 2332 len. 16]: Science has recently discovered that the ant does not lay up anything for winter use .
Parsing [sent. 2333 len. 12]: This will knock him out of literature , to some extent .
Parsing [sent. 2334 len. 31]: He does not work , except when people are looking , and only then when the observer has a green , naturalistic look , and seems to be taking notes .
Parsing [sent. 2335 len. 13]: This amounts to deception , and will injure him for the Sunday-schools .
Parsing [sent. 2336 len. 17]: He has not judgment enough to know what is good to eat from what is n't .
Parsing [sent. 2337 len. 15]: This amounts to ignorance , and will impair the world 's respect for him .
Parsing [sent. 2338 len. 14]: He can not stroll around a stump and find his way home again .
Parsing [sent. 2339 len. 31]: This amounts to idiocy , and once the damaging fact is established , thoughtful people will cease to look up to him , the sentimental will cease to fondle him .
Parsing [sent. 2340 len. 23]: His vaunted industry is but a vanity and of no effect , since he never gets home with anything he starts with .
Parsing [sent. 2341 len. 34]: This disposes of the last remnant of his reputation and wholly destroys his main usefulness as a moral agent , since it will make the sluggard hesitate to go to him any more .
Parsing [sent. 2342 len. 35]: It is strange , beyond comprehension , that so manifest a humbug as the ant has been able to fool so many nations and keep it up so many ages without being found out .
Parsing [sent. 2343 len. 25]: The ant is strong , but we saw another strong thing , where we had not suspected the presence of much muscular power before .
Parsing [sent. 2344 len. 49]: A toadstool -- that vegetable which springs to full growth in a single night -- had torn loose and lifted a matted mass of pine needles and dirt of twice its own bulk into the air , and supported it there , like a column supporting a shed .
Parsing [sent. 2345 len. 17]: Ten thousand toadstools , with the right purchase , could lift a man , I suppose .
Parsing [sent. 2346 len. 7]: But what good would it do ?
Parsing [sent. 2347 len. 9]: All our afternoon 's progress had been uphill .
Parsing [sent. 2348 len. 57]: About five or half past we reached the summit , and all of a sudden the dense curtain of the forest parted and we looked down into a deep and beautiful gorge and out over a wide panorama of wooded mountains with their summits shining in the sun and their glade-furrowed sides dimmed with purple shade .
Parsing [sent. 2349 len. 93]: The gorge under our feet -- called Allerheiligen -- afforded room in the grassy level at its head for a cozy and delightful human nest , shut away from the world and its botherations , and consequently the monks of the old times had not failed to spy it out ; and here were the brown and comely ruins of their church and convent to prove that priests had as fine an instinct seven hundred years ago in ferreting out the choicest nooks and corners in a land as priests have today .
Parsing [sent. 2350 len. 20]: A big hotel crowds the ruins a little , now , and drives a brisk trade with summer tourists .
Parsing [sent. 2351 len. 23]: We descended into the gorge and had a supper which would have been very satisfactory if the trout had not been boiled .
Parsing [sent. 2352 len. 19]: The Germans are pretty sure to boil a trout or anything else if left to their own devices .
Parsing [sent. 2353 len. 28]: This is an argument of some value in support of the theory that they were the original colonists of the wild islands of the coast of Scotland .
Parsing [sent. 2354 len. 38]: A schooner laden with oranges was wrecked upon one of those islands a few years ago , and the gentle savages rendered the captain such willing assistance that he gave them as many oranges as they wanted .
Parsing [sent. 2355 len. 10]: Next day he asked them how they liked them .
Parsing [sent. 2356 len. 31]: They shook their heads and said : `` Baked , they were tough ; and even boiled , they war n't things for a hungry man to hanker after . ''
Parsing [sent. 2357 len. 8]: We went down the glen after supper .
Parsing [sent. 2358 len. 13]: It is beautiful -- a mixture of sylvan loveliness and craggy wildness .
Parsing [sent. 2359 len. 32]: A limpid torrent goes whistling down the glen , and toward the foot of it winds through a narrow cleft between lofty precipices and hurls itself over a succession of falls .
Parsing [sent. 2360 len. 45]: After one passes the last of these he has a backward glimpse at the falls which is very pleasing -- they rise in a seven-stepped stairway of foamy and glittering cascades , and make a picture which is as charming as it is unusual .
Parsing [sent. 2361 len. 43]: CHAPTER XXIII -LSB- Nicodemus Dodge and the Skeleton -RSB- We were satisfied that we could walk to Oppenau in one day , now that we were in practice ; so we set out the next morning after breakfast determined to do it .
Parsing [sent. 2362 len. 17]: It was all the way downhill , and we had the loveliest summer weather for it .
Parsing [sent. 2363 len. 61]: So we set the pedometer and then stretched away on an easy , regular stride , down through the cloven forest , drawing in the fragrant breath of the morning in deep refreshing draughts , and wishing we might never have anything to do forever but walk to Oppenau and keep on doing it and then doing it over again .
Parsing [sent. 2364 len. 24]: Now , the true charm of pedestrianism does not lie in the walking , or in the scenery , but in the talking .
Parsing [sent. 2365 len. 63]: The walking is good to time the movement of the tongue by , and to keep the blood and the brain stirred up and active ; the scenery and the woodsy smells are good to bear in upon a man an unconscious and unobtrusive charm and solace to eye and soul and sense ; but the supreme pleasure comes from the talk .
Parsing [sent. 2366 len. 38]: It is no matter whether one talks wisdom or nonsense , the case is the same , the bulk of the enjoyment lies in the wagging of the gladsome jaw and the flapping of the sympathetic ear .
Parsing [sent. 2367 len. 23]: And what motley variety of subjects a couple of people will casually rake over in the course of a day 's tramp !
Parsing [sent. 2368 len. 33]: There being no constraint , a change of subject is always in order , and so a body is not likely to keep pegging at a single topic until it grows tiresome .
Parsing [sent. 2369 len. 38]: We discussed everything we knew , during the first fifteen or twenty minutes , that morning , and then branched out into the glad , free , boundless realm of the things we were not certain about .
Parsing [sent. 2370 len. 33]: Harris said that if the best writer in the world once got the slovenly habit of doubling up his `` haves '' he could never get rid of it while he lived .
Parsing [sent. 2371 len. 51]: That is to say , if a man gets the habit of saying `` I should have liked to have known more about it '' instead of saying simply and sensibly , `` I should have liked to know more about it , '' that man 's disease is incurable .
Parsing [sent. 2372 len. 33]: Harris said that his sort of lapse is to be found in every copy of every newspaper that has ever been printed in English , and in almost all of our books .
Parsing [sent. 2373 len. 14]: He said he had observed it in Kirkham 's grammar and in Macaulay .
Parsing [sent. 2374 len. 17]: Harris believed that milk-teeth are commoner in men 's mouths than those `` doubled-up haves . ''
Parsing [sent. 2375 len. 47]: I do not know that there have not been moments in the course of the present session when I should have been very glad to have accepted the proposal of my noble friend , and to have exchanged parts in some of our evenings of work .
Parsing [sent. 2376 len. 18]: -- -LSB- From a Speech of the English Chancellor of the Exchequer , August , 1879 . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 2377 len. 7]: That changed the subject to dentistry .
Parsing [sent. 2378 len. 30]: I said I believed the average man dreaded tooth-pulling more than amputation , and that he would yell quicker under the former operation than he would under the latter .
Parsing [sent. 2379 len. 20]: The philosopher Harris said that the average man would not yell in either case if he had an audience .
Parsing [sent. 2380 len. 33]: Then he continued : `` When our brigade first went into camp on the Potomac , we used to be brought up standing , occasionally , by an ear-splitting howl of anguish .
Parsing [sent. 2381 len. 14]: That meant that a soldier was getting a tooth pulled in a tent .
Parsing [sent. 2382 len. 12]: But the surgeons soon changed that ; they instituted open-air dentistry .
Parsing [sent. 2383 len. 20]: There never was a howl afterward -- that is , from the man who was having the tooth pulled .
Parsing [sent. 2384 len. 80]: At the daily dental hour there would always be about five hundred soldiers gathered together in the neighborhood of that dental chair waiting to see the performance -- and help ; and the moment the surgeon took a grip on the candidate 's tooth and began to lift , every one of those five hundred rascals would clap his hand to his jaw and begin to hop around on one leg and howl with all the lungs he had !
Parsing [sent. 2385 len. 18]: It was enough to raise your hair to hear that variegated and enormous unanimous caterwaul burst out !
Parsing [sent. 2386 len. 25]: With so big and so derisive an audience as that , a sufferer would n't emit a sound though you pulled his head off .
Parsing [sent. 2387 len. 38]: The surgeons said that pretty often a patient was compelled to laugh , in the midst of his pangs , but that they had never caught one crying out , after the open-air exhibition was instituted . ''
Parsing [sent. 2388 len. 62]: Dental surgeons suggested doctors , doctors suggested death , death suggested skeletons -- and so , by a logical process the conversation melted out of one of these subjects and into the next , until the topic of skeletons raised up Nicodemus Dodge out of the deep grave in my memory where he had lain buried and forgotten for twenty-five years .
Parsing [sent. 2389 len. 118]: When I was a boy in a printing-office in Missouri , a loose-jointed , long-legged , tow-headed , jeans-clad countrified cub of about sixteen lounged in one day , and without removing his hands from the depths of his trousers pockets or taking off his faded ruin of a slouch hat , whose broken rim hung limp and ragged about his eyes and ears like a bug-eaten cabbage leaf , stared indifferently around , then leaned his hip against the editor 's table , crossed his mighty brogans , aimed at a distant fly from a crevice in his upper teeth , laid him low , and said with composure : `` Whar 's the boss ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2390 len. 27]: `` I am the boss , '' said the editor , following this curious bit of architecture wonderingly along up to its clock-face with his eye .
Parsing [sent. 2391 len. 17]: `` Do n't want anybody fur to learn the business , ` tai n't likely ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2392 len. 8]: `` Well , I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 2393 len. 8]: Would you like to learn it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2394 len. 57]: `` Pap 's so po ' he cai n't run me no mo ' , so I want to git a show somers if I kin , ` taint no diffunce what -- I 'm strong and hearty , and I do n't turn my back on no kind of work , hard nur soft . ''
Parsing [sent. 2395 len. 14]: `` Do you think you would like to learn the printing business ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2396 len. 31]: `` Well , I do n't re ` ly k ` yer a durn what I DO learn , so 's I git a chance fur to make my way .
Parsing [sent. 2397 len. 12]: I 'd jist as soon learn print 'n' s anything . ''
Parsing [sent. 2398 len. 6]: `` Can you read ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2399 len. 7]: `` Yes -- middlin ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 2400 len. 4]: `` Write ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2401 len. 14]: `` Well , I 've seed people could lay over me thar . ''
Parsing [sent. 2402 len. 4]: `` Cipher ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2403 len. 25]: `` Not good enough to keep store , I do n't reckon , but up as fur as twelve-times-twelve I ai n't no slouch .
Parsing [sent. 2404 len. 11]: ` Tother side of that is what gits me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2405 len. 7]: `` Where is your home ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2406 len. 9]: `` I 'm f 'm old Shelby . ''
Parsing [sent. 2407 len. 10]: `` What 's your father 's religious denomination ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2408 len. 3]: `` Him ?
Parsing [sent. 2409 len. 8]: Oh , he 's a blacksmith . ''
Parsing [sent. 2410 len. 12]: `` No , no -- I do n't mean his trade .
Parsing [sent. 2411 len. 7]: What 's his RELIGIOUS DENOMINATION ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2412 len. 11]: `` OH -- I did n't understand you befo ' .
Parsing [sent. 2413 len. 6]: He 's a Freemason . ''
Parsing [sent. 2414 len. 13]: `` No , no , you do n't get my meaning yet .
Parsing [sent. 2415 len. 13]: What I mean is , does he belong to any CHURCH ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2416 len. 7]: `` NOW you 're talkin ' !
Parsing [sent. 2417 len. 18]: Could n't make out what you was a-tryin ' to git through yo ' head no way .
Parsing [sent. 2418 len. 5]: B'long to a CHURCH !
Parsing [sent. 2419 len. 18]: Why , boss , he 's ben the pizenest kind of Free-will Babtis ' for forty year .
Parsing [sent. 2420 len. 11]: They ai n't no pizener ones 'n what HE is .
Parsing [sent. 2421 len. 7]: Mighty good man , pap is .
Parsing [sent. 2422 len. 4]: Everybody says that .
Parsing [sent. 2423 len. 21]: If they said any diffrunt they would n't say it whar I wuz -- not MUCH they would n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 2424 len. 8]: `` What is your own religion ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2425 len. 28]: `` Well , boss , you 've kind o ' got me , there -- and yit you hai n't got me so mighty much , nuther .
Parsing [sent. 2426 len. 78]: I think ' t if a feller he ` ps another feller when he 's in trouble , and do n't cuss , and do n't do no mean things , nur noth 'n' he ain ' no business to do , and do n't spell the Saviour 's name with a little g , he ai n't runnin ' no resks -- he 's about as saift as he b ` longed to a church . ''
Parsing [sent. 2427 len. 16]: `` But suppose he did spell it with a little g -- what then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2428 len. 38]: `` Well , if he done it a-purpose , I reckon he would n't stand no chance -- he OUGHT N'T to have no chance , anyway , I 'm most rotten certain ` bout that . ''
Parsing [sent. 2429 len. 7]: `` What is your name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2430 len. 5]: `` Nicodemus Dodge . ''
Parsing [sent. 2431 len. 10]: `` I think maybe you 'll do , Nicodemus .
Parsing [sent. 2432 len. 10]: We 'll give you a trial , anyway . ''
Parsing [sent. 2433 len. 5]: `` All right . ''
Parsing [sent. 2434 len. 9]: `` When would you like to begin ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2435 len. 4]: `` Now . ''
Parsing [sent. 2436 len. 28]: So , within ten minutes after we had first glimpsed this nondescript he was one of us , and with his coat off and hard at it .
Parsing [sent. 2437 len. 40]: Beyond that end of our establishment which was furthest from the street , was a deserted garden , pathless , and thickly grown with the bloomy and villainous `` jimpson '' weed and its common friend the stately sunflower .
Parsing [sent. 2438 len. 38]: In the midst of this mournful spot was a decayed and aged little `` frame '' house with but one room , one window , and no ceiling -- it had been a smoke-house a generation before .
Parsing [sent. 2439 len. 12]: Nicodemus was given this lonely and ghostly den as a bedchamber .
Parsing [sent. 2440 len. 19]: The village smarties recognized a treasure in Nicodemus , right away -- a butt to play jokes on .
Parsing [sent. 2441 len. 13]: It was easy to see that he was inconceivably green and confiding .
Parsing [sent. 2442 len. 47]: George Jones had the glory of perpetrating the first joke on him ; he gave him a cigar with a firecracker in it and winked to the crowd to come ; the thing exploded presently and swept away the bulk of Nicodemus 's eyebrows and eyelashes .
Parsing [sent. 2443 len. 23]: He simply said : `` I consider them kind of seeg ` yars dangersome , '' -- and seemed to suspect nothing .
Parsing [sent. 2444 len. 15]: The next evening Nicodemus waylaid George and poured a bucket of ice-water over him .
Parsing [sent. 2445 len. 17]: One day , while Nicodemus was in swimming , Tom McElroy `` tied '' his clothes .
Parsing [sent. 2446 len. 12]: Nicodemus made a bonfire of Tom 's by way of retaliation .
Parsing [sent. 2447 len. 36]: A third joke was played upon Nicodemus a day or two later -- he walked up the middle aisle of the village church , Sunday night , with a staring handbill pinned between his shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 2448 len. 52]: The joker spent the remainder of the night , after church , in the cellar of a deserted house , and Nicodemus sat on the cellar door till toward breakfast-time to make sure that the prisoner remembered that if any noise was made , some rough treatment would be the consequence .
Parsing [sent. 2449 len. 21]: The cellar had two feet of stagnant water in it , and was bottomed with six inches of soft mud .
Parsing [sent. 2450 len. 7]: But I wander from the point .
Parsing [sent. 2451 len. 15]: It was the subject of skeletons that brought this boy back to my recollection .
Parsing [sent. 2452 len. 38]: Before a very long time had elapsed , the village smarties began to feel an uncomfortable consciousness of not having made a very shining success out of their attempts on the simpleton from `` old Shelby . ''
Parsing [sent. 2453 len. 6]: Experimenters grew scarce and chary .
Parsing [sent. 2454 len. 9]: Now the young doctor came to the rescue .
Parsing [sent. 2455 len. 24]: There was delight and applause when he proposed to scare Nicodemus to death , and explained how he was going to do it .
Parsing [sent. 2456 len. 63]: He had a noble new skeleton -- the skeleton of the late and only local celebrity , Jimmy Finn , the village drunkard -- a grisly piece of property which he had bought of Jimmy Finn himself , at auction , for fifty dollars , under great competition , when Jimmy lay very sick in the tan-yard a fortnight before his death .
Parsing [sent. 2457 len. 21]: The fifty dollars had gone promptly for whiskey and had considerably hurried up the change of ownership in the skeleton .
Parsing [sent. 2458 len. 13]: The doctor would put Jimmy Finn 's skeleton in Nicodemus 's bed !
Parsing [sent. 2459 len. 12]: This was done -- about half past ten in the evening .
Parsing [sent. 2460 len. 26]: About Nicodemus 's usual bedtime -- midnight -- the village jokers came creeping stealthily through the jimpson weeds and sunflowers toward the lonely frame den .
Parsing [sent. 2461 len. 8]: They reached the window and peeped in .
Parsing [sent. 2462 len. 99]: There sat the long-legged pauper , on his bed , in a very short shirt , and nothing more ; he was dangling his legs contentedly back and forth , and wheezing the music of `` Camptown Races '' out of a paper-overlaid comb which he was pressing against his mouth ; by him lay a new jewsharp , a new top , and solid india-rubber ball , a handful of painted marbles , five pounds of `` store '' candy , and a well-gnawed slab of gingerbread as big and as thick as a volume of sheet-music .
Parsing [sent. 2463 len. 18]: He had sold the skeleton to a traveling quack for three dollars and was enjoying the result !
Parsing [sent. 2464 len. 31]: Just as we had finished talking about skeletons and were drifting into the subject of fossils , Harris and I heard a shout , and glanced up the steep hillside .
Parsing [sent. 2465 len. 28]: We saw men and women standing away up there looking frightened , and there was a bulky object tumbling and floundering down the steep slope toward us .
Parsing [sent. 2466 len. 22]: We got out of the way , and when the object landed in the road it proved to be a boy .
Parsing [sent. 2467 len. 24]: He had tripped and fallen , and there was nothing for him to do but trust to luck and take what might come .
Parsing [sent. 2468 len. 21]: When one starts to roll down a place like that , there is no stopping till the bottom is reached .
Parsing [sent. 2469 len. 49]: Think of people FARMING on a slant which is so steep that the best you can say of it -- if you want to be fastidiously accurate -- is , that it is a little steeper than a ladder and not quite so steep as a mansard roof .
Parsing [sent. 2470 len. 7]: But that is what they do .
Parsing [sent. 2471 len. 17]: Some of the little farms on the hillside opposite Heidelberg were stood up `` edgeways . ''
Parsing [sent. 2472 len. 26]: The boy was wonderfully jolted up , and his head was bleeding , from cuts which it had got from small stones on the way .
Parsing [sent. 2473 len. 29]: Harris and I gathered him up and set him on a stone , and by that time the men and women had scampered down and brought his cap .
Parsing [sent. 2474 len. 43]: Men , women , and children flocked out from neighboring cottages and joined the crowd ; the pale boy was petted , and stared at , and commiserated , and water was brought for him to drink and bathe his bruises in .
Parsing [sent. 2475 len. 7]: And such another clatter of tongues !
Parsing [sent. 2476 len. 61]: All who had seen the catastrophe were describing it at once , and each trying to talk louder than his neighbor ; and one youth of a superior genius ran a little way up the hill , called attention , tripped , fell , rolled down among us , and thus triumphantly showed exactly how the thing had been done .
Parsing [sent. 2477 len. 76]: Harris and I were included in all the descriptions ; how we were coming along ; how Hans Gross shouted ; how we looked up startled ; how we saw Peter coming like a cannon-shot ; how judiciously we got out of the way , and let him come ; and with what presence of mind we picked him up and brushed him off and set him on a rock when the performance was over .
Parsing [sent. 2478 len. 94]: We were as much heroes as anybody else , except Peter , and were so recognized ; we were taken with Peter and the populace to Peter 's mother 's cottage , and there we ate bread and cheese , and drank milk and beer with everybody , and had a most sociable good time ; and when we left we had a handshake all around , and were receiving and shouting back LEB ' WOHL 's until a turn in the road separated us from our cordial and kindly new friends forever .
Parsing [sent. 2479 len. 5]: We accomplished our undertaking .
Parsing [sent. 2480 len. 28]: At half past eight in the evening we stepped into Oppenau , just eleven hours and a half out of Allerheiligen -- one hundred and forty-six miles .
Parsing [sent. 2481 len. 40]: This is the distance by pedometer ; the guide-book and the Imperial Ordinance maps make it only ten and a quarter -- a surprising blunder , for these two authorities are usually singularly accurate in the matter of distances .
Parsing [sent. 2482 len. 33]: CHAPTER XXIV -LSB- I Protect the Empress of Germany -RSB- That was a thoroughly satisfactory walk -- and the only one we were ever to have which was all the way downhill .
Parsing [sent. 2483 len. 16]: We took the train next morning and returned to Baden-Baden through fearful fogs of dust .
Parsing [sent. 2484 len. 23]: Every seat was crowded , too ; for it was Sunday , and consequently everybody was taking a `` pleasure '' excursion .
Parsing [sent. 2485 len. 2]: Hot !
Parsing [sent. 2486 len. 24]: the sky was an oven -- and a sound one , too , with no cracks in it to let in any air .
Parsing [sent. 2487 len. 10]: An odd time for a pleasure excursion , certainly !
Parsing [sent. 2488 len. 17]: Sunday is the great day on the continent -- the free day , the happy day .
Parsing [sent. 2489 len. 14]: One can break the Sabbath in a hundred ways without committing any sin .
Parsing [sent. 2490 len. 27]: We do not work on Sunday , because the commandment forbids it ; the Germans do not work on Sunday , because the commandment forbids it .
Parsing [sent. 2491 len. 22]: We rest on Sunday , because the commandment requires it ; the Germans rest on Sunday because the commandment requires it .
Parsing [sent. 2492 len. 15]: But in the definition of the word `` rest '' lies all the difference .
Parsing [sent. 2493 len. 62]: With us , its Sunday meaning is , stay in the house and keep still ; with the Germans its Sunday and week-day meanings seem to be the same -- rest the TIRED PART , and never mind the other parts of the frame ; rest the tired part , and use the means best calculated to rest that particular part .
Parsing [sent. 2494 len. 170]: Thus : If one 's duties have kept him in the house all the week , it will rest him to be out on Sunday ; if his duties have required him to read weighty and serious matter all the week , it will rest him to read light matter on Sunday ; if his occupation has busied him with death and funerals all the week , it will rest him to go to the theater Sunday night and put in two or three hours laughing at a comedy ; if he is tired with digging ditches or felling trees all the week , it will rest him to lie quiet in the house on Sunday ; if the hand , the arm , the brain , the tongue , or any other member , is fatigued with inanition , it is not to be rested by addeding a day 's inanition ; but if a member is fatigued with exertion , inanition is the right rest for it .
Parsing [sent. 2495 len. 35]: Such is the way in which the Germans seem to define the word `` rest '' ; that is to say , they rest a member by recreating , recuperating , restoring its forces .
Parsing [sent. 2496 len. 7]: But our definition is less broad .
Parsing [sent. 2497 len. 29]: We all rest alike on Sunday -- by secluding ourselves and keeping still , whether that is the surest way to rest the most of us or not .
Parsing [sent. 2498 len. 15]: The Germans make the actors , the preachers , etc. , work on Sunday .
Parsing [sent. 2499 len. 84]: We encourage the preachers , the editors , the printers , etc. , to work on Sunday , and imagine that none of the sin of it falls upon us ; but I do not know how we are going to get around the fact that if it is wrong for the printer to work at his trade on Sunday it must be equally wrong for the preacher to work at his , since the commandment has made no exception in his favor .
Parsing [sent. 2500 len. 16]: We buy Monday morning 's paper and read it , and thus encourage Sunday printing .
Parsing [sent. 2501 len. 8]: But I shall never do it again .
Parsing [sent. 2502 len. 42]: The Germans remember the Sabbath-day to keep it holy , by abstaining from work , as commanded ; we keep it holy by abstaining from work , as commanded , and by also abstaining from play , which is not commanded .
Parsing [sent. 2503 len. 27]: Perhaps we constructively BREAK the command to rest , because the resting we do is in most cases only a name , and not a fact .
Parsing [sent. 2504 len. 26]: These reasonings have sufficed , in a measure , to mend the rent in my conscience which I made by traveling to Baden-Baden that Sunday .
Parsing [sent. 2505 len. 17]: We arrived in time to furbish up and get to the English church before services began .
Parsing [sent. 2506 len. 73]: We arrived in considerable style , too , for the landlord had ordered the first carriage that could be found , since there was no time to lose , and our coachman was so splendidly liveried that we were probably mistaken for a brace of stray dukes ; why else were we honored with a pew all to ourselves , away up among the very elect at the left of the chancel ?
Parsing [sent. 2507 len. 6]: That was my first thought .
Parsing [sent. 2508 len. 61]: In the pew directly in front of us sat an elderly lady , plainly and cheaply dressed ; at her side sat a young lady with a very sweet face , and she also was quite simply dressed ; but around us and about us were clothes and jewels which it would do anybody 's heart good to worship in .
Parsing [sent. 2509 len. 38]: I thought it was pretty manifest that the elderly lady was embarrassed at finding herself in such a conspicuous place arrayed in such cheap apparel ; I began to feel sorry for her and troubled about her .
Parsing [sent. 2510 len. 48]: She tried to seem very busy with her prayer-book and her responses , and unconscious that she was out of place , but I said to myself , `` She is not succeeding -- there is a distressed tremulousness in her voice which betrays increasing embarrassment . ''
Parsing [sent. 2511 len. 34]: Presently the Savior 's name was mentioned , and in her flurry she lost her head completely , and rose and courtesied , instead of making a slight nod as everybody else did .
Parsing [sent. 2512 len. 65]: The sympathetic blood surged to my temples and I turned and gave those fine birds what I intended to be a beseeching look , but my feelings got the better of me and changed it into a look which said , `` If any of you pets of fortune laugh at this poor soul , you will deserve to be flayed for it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2513 len. 21]: Things went from bad to worse , and I shortly found myself mentally taking the unfriended lady under my protection .
Parsing [sent. 2514 len. 7]: My mind was wholly upon her .
Parsing [sent. 2515 len. 7]: I forgot all about the sermon .
Parsing [sent. 2516 len. 45]: Her embarrassment took stronger and stronger hold upon her ; she got to snapping the lid of her smelling-bottle -- it made a loud , sharp sound , but in her trouble she snapped and snapped away , unconscious of what she was doing .
Parsing [sent. 2517 len. 44]: The last extremity was reached when the collection-plate began its rounds ; the moderate people threw in pennies , the nobles and the rich contributed silver , but she laid a twenty-mark gold piece upon the book-rest before her with a sounding slap !
Parsing [sent. 2518 len. 30]: I said to myself , `` She has parted with all her little hoard to buy the consideration of these unpitying people -- it is a sorrowful spectacle . ''
Parsing [sent. 2519 len. 60]: I did not venture to look around this time ; but as the service closed , I said to myself , `` Let them laugh , it is their opportunity ; but at the door of this church they shall see her step into our fine carriage with us , and our gaudy coachman shall drive her home . ''
Parsing [sent. 2520 len. 16]: Then she rose -- and all the congregation stood while she walked down the aisle .
Parsing [sent. 2521 len. 7]: She was the Empress of Germany !
Parsing [sent. 2522 len. 14]: No -- she had not been so much embarrassed as I had supposed .
Parsing [sent. 2523 len. 35]: My imagination had got started on the wrong scent , and that is always hopeless ; one is sure , then , to go straight on misinterpreting everything , clear through to the end .
Parsing [sent. 2524 len. 29]: The young lady with her imperial Majesty was a maid of honor -- and I had been taking her for one of her boarders , all the time .
Parsing [sent. 2525 len. 31]: This is the only time I have ever had an Empress under my personal protection ; and considering my inexperience , I wonder I got through with it so well .
Parsing [sent. 2526 len. 24]: I should have been a little embarrassed myself if I had known earlier what sort of a contract I had on my hands .
Parsing [sent. 2527 len. 12]: We found that the Empress had been in Baden-Baden several days .
Parsing [sent. 2528 len. 16]: It is said that she never attends any but the English form of church service .
Parsing [sent. 2529 len. 48]: I lay abed and read and rested from my journey 's fatigues the remainder of that Sunday , but I sent my agent to represent me at the afternoon service , for I never allow anything to interfere with my habit of attending church twice every Sunday .
Parsing [sent. 2530 len. 21]: There was a vast crowd in the public grounds that night to hear the band play the `` Fremersberg . ''
Parsing [sent. 2531 len. 73]: This piece tells one of the old legends of the region ; how a great noble of the Middle Ages got lost in the mountains , and wandered about with his dogs in a violent storm , until at last the faint tones of a monastery bell , calling the monks to a midnight service , caught his ear , and he followed the direction the sounds came from and was saved .
Parsing [sent. 2532 len. 145]: A beautiful air ran through the music , without ceasing , sometimes loud and strong , sometimes so soft that it could hardly be distinguished -- but it was always there ; it swung grandly along through the shrill whistling of the storm-wind , the rattling patter of the rain , and the boom and crash of the thunder ; it wound soft and low through the lesser sounds , the distant ones , such as the throbbing of the convent bell , the melodious winding of the hunter 's horn , the distressed bayings of his dogs , and the solemn chanting of the monks ; it rose again , with a jubilant ring , and mingled itself with the country songs and dances of the peasants assembled in the convent hall to cheer up the rescued huntsman while he ate his supper .
Parsing [sent. 2533 len. 11]: The instruments imitated all these sounds with a marvelous exactness .
Parsing [sent. 2534 len. 67]: More than one man started to raise his umbrella when the storm burst forth and the sheets of mimic rain came driving by ; it was hardly possible to keep from putting your hand to your hat when the fierce wind began to rage and shriek ; and it was NOT possible to refrain from starting when those sudden and charmingly real thunder-crashes were let loose .
Parsing [sent. 2535 len. 59]: I suppose the `` Fremersberg '' is a very low-grade music ; I know , indeed , that it MUST be low-grade music , because it delighted me , warmed me , moved me , stirred me , uplifted me , enraptured me , that I was full of cry all the time , and mad with enthusiasm .
Parsing [sent. 2536 len. 14]: My soul had never had such a scouring out since I was born .
Parsing [sent. 2537 len. 71]: The solemn and majestic chanting of the monks was not done by instruments , but by men 's voices ; and it rose and fell , and rose again in that rich confusion of warring sounds , and pulsing bells , and the stately swing of that ever-present enchanting air , and it seemed to me that nothing but the very lowest of low-grade music COULD be so divinely beautiful .
Parsing [sent. 2538 len. 36]: The great crowd which the `` Fremersberg '' had called out was another evidence that it was low-grade music ; for only the few are educated up to a point where high-grade music gives pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 2539 len. 14]: I have never heard enough classic music to be able to enjoy it .
Parsing [sent. 2540 len. 14]: I dislike the opera because I want to love it and ca n't .
Parsing [sent. 2541 len. 41]: I suppose there are two kinds of music -- one kind which one feels , just as an oyster might , and another sort which requires a higher faculty , a faculty which must be assisted and developed by teaching .
Parsing [sent. 2542 len. 17]: Yet if base music gives certain of us wings , why should we want any other ?
Parsing [sent. 2543 len. 4]: But we do .
Parsing [sent. 2544 len. 11]: We want it because the higher and better like it .
Parsing [sent. 2545 len. 33]: We want it without giving it the necessary time and trouble ; so we climb into that upper tier , that dress-circle , by a lie ; we PRETEND we like it .
Parsing [sent. 2546 len. 28]: I know several of that sort of people -- and I propose to be one of them myself when I get home with my fine European education .
Parsing [sent. 2547 len. 6]: And then there is painting .
Parsing [sent. 2548 len. 24]: What a red rag is to a bull , Turner 's `` Slave Ship '' was to me , before I studied art .
Parsing [sent. 2549 len. 41]: Mr. Ruskin is educated in art up to a point where that picture throws him into as mad an ecstasy of pleasure as it used to throw me into one of rage , last year , when I was ignorant .
Parsing [sent. 2550 len. 75]: His cultivation enables him -- and me , now -- to see water in that glaring yellow mud , and natural effects in those lurid explosions of mixed smoke and flame , and crimson sunset glories ; it reconciles him -- and me , now -- to the floating of iron cable-chains and other unfloatable things ; it reconciles us to fishes swimming around on top of the mud -- I mean the water .
Parsing [sent. 2551 len. 33]: The most of the picture is a manifest impossibility -- that is to say , a lie ; and only rigid cultivation can enable a man to find truth in a lie .
Parsing [sent. 2552 len. 25]: But it enabled Mr. Ruskin to do it , and it has enabled me to do it , and I am thankful for it .
Parsing [sent. 2553 len. 42]: A Boston newspaper reporter went and took a look at the Slave Ship floundering about in that fierce conflagration of reds and yellows , and said it reminded him of a tortoise-shell cat having a fit in a platter of tomatoes .
Parsing [sent. 2554 len. 25]: In my then uneducated state , that went home to my non-cultivation , and I thought here is a man with an unobstructed eye .
Parsing [sent. 2555 len. 12]: Mr. Ruskin would have said : This person is an ass .
Parsing [sent. 2556 len. 9]: That is what I would say , now .
Parsing [sent. 2557 len. 34]: Months after this was written , I happened into the National Gallery in London , and soon became so fascinated with the Turner pictures that I could hardly get away from the place .
Parsing [sent. 2558 len. 31]: I went there often , afterward , meaning to see the rest of the gallery , but the Turner spell was too strong ; it could not be shaken off .
Parsing [sent. 2559 len. 17]: However , the Turners which attracted me most did not remind me of the Slave Ship .
Parsing [sent. 2560 len. 15]: However , our business in Baden-Baden this time , was to join our courier .
Parsing [sent. 2561 len. 28]: I had thought it best to hire one , as we should be in Italy , by and by , and we did not know the language .
Parsing [sent. 2562 len. 4]: Neither did he .
Parsing [sent. 2563 len. 14]: We found him at the hotel , ready to take charge of us .
Parsing [sent. 2564 len. 11]: I asked him if he was `` all fixed . ''
Parsing [sent. 2565 len. 5]: He said he was .
Parsing [sent. 2566 len. 5]: That was very true .
Parsing [sent. 2567 len. 13]: He had a trunk , two small satchels , and an umbrella .
Parsing [sent. 2568 len. 13]: I was to pay him fifty-five dollars a month and railway fares .
Parsing [sent. 2569 len. 19]: On the continent the railway fare on a trunk is about the same it is on a man .
Parsing [sent. 2570 len. 11]: Couriers do not have to pay any board and lodging .
Parsing [sent. 2571 len. 12]: This seems a great saving to the tourist -- at first .
Parsing [sent. 2572 len. 17]: It does not occur to the tourist that SOMEBODY pays that man 's board and lodging .
Parsing [sent. 2573 len. 17]: It occurs to him by and by , however , in one of his lucid moments .
Parsing [sent. 2574 len. 28]: CHAPTER XXV -LSB- Hunted by the Little Chamois -RSB- Next morning we left in the train for Switzerland , and reached Lucerne about ten o'clock at night .
Parsing [sent. 2575 len. 17]: The first discovery I made was that the beauty of the lake had not been exaggerated .
Parsing [sent. 2576 len. 10]: Within a day or two I made another discovery .
Parsing [sent. 2577 len. 45]: This was , that the lauded chamois is not a wild goat ; that it is not a horned animal ; that it is not shy ; that it does not avoid human society ; and that there is no peril in hunting it .
Parsing [sent. 2578 len. 127]: The chamois is a black or brown creature no bigger than a mustard seed ; you do not have to go after it , it comes after you ; it arrives in vast herds and skips and scampers all over your body , inside your clothes ; thus it is not shy , but extremely sociable ; it is not afraid of man , on the contrary , it will attack him ; its bite is not dangerous , but neither is it pleasant ; its activity has not been overstated -- if you try to put your finger on it , it will skip a thousand times its own length at one jump , and no eye is sharp enough to see where it lights .
Parsing [sent. 2579 len. 61]: A great deal of romantic nonsense has been written about the Swiss chamois and the perils of hunting it , whereas the truth is that even women and children hunt it , and fearlessly ; indeed , everybody hunts it ; the hunting is going on all the time , day and night , in bed and out of it .
Parsing [sent. 2580 len. 33]: It is poetic foolishness to hunt it with a gun ; very few people do that ; there is not one man in a million who can hit it with a gun .
Parsing [sent. 2581 len. 23]: It is much easier to catch it than it is to shoot it , and only the experienced chamois-hunter can do either .
Parsing [sent. 2582 len. 16]: Another common piece of exaggeration is that about the `` scarcity '' of the chamois .
Parsing [sent. 2583 len. 7]: It is the reverse of scarce .
Parsing [sent. 2584 len. 14]: Droves of one hundred million chamois are not unusual in the Swiss hotels .
Parsing [sent. 2585 len. 13]: Indeed , they are so numerous as to be a great pest .
Parsing [sent. 2586 len. 32]: The romancers always dress up the chamois-hunter in a fanciful and picturesque costume , whereas the best way to hunt this game is to do it without any costume at all .
Parsing [sent. 2587 len. 21]: The article of commerce called chamois-skin is another fraud ; nobody could skin a chamois , it is too small .
Parsing [sent. 2588 len. 21]: The creature is a humbug in every way , and everything which has been written about it is sentimental exaggeration .
Parsing [sent. 2589 len. 54]: It was no pleasure to me to find the chamois out , for he had been one of my pet illusions ; all my life it had been my dream to see him in his native wilds some day , and engage in the adventurous sport of chasing him from cliff to cliff .
Parsing [sent. 2590 len. 78]: It is no pleasure to me to expose him , now , and destroy the reader 's delight in him and respect for him , but still it must be done , for when an honest writer discovers an imposition it is his simple duty to strip it bare and hurl it down from its place of honor , no matter who suffers by it ; any other course would render him unworthy of the public confidence .
Parsing [sent. 2591 len. 6]: Lucerne is a charming place .
Parsing [sent. 2592 len. 86]: It begins at the water 's edge , with a fringe of hotels , and scrambles up and spreads itself over two or three sharp hills in a crowded , disorderly , but picturesque way , offering to the eye a heaped-up confusion of red roofs , quaint gables , dormer windows , toothpick steeples , with here and there a bit of ancient embattled wall bending itself over the ridges , worm-fashion , and here and there an old square tower of heavy masonry .
Parsing [sent. 2593 len. 47]: And also here and there a town clock with only one hand -- a hand which stretches across the dial and has no joint in it ; such a clock helps out the picture , but you can not tell the time of day by it .
Parsing [sent. 2594 len. 24]: Between the curving line of hotels and the lake is a broad avenue with lamps and a double rank of low shade trees .
Parsing [sent. 2595 len. 22]: The lake-front is walled with masonry like a pier , and has a railing , to keep people from walking overboard .
Parsing [sent. 2596 len. 58]: All day long the vehicles dash along the avenue , and nurses , children , and tourists sit in the shade of the trees , or lean on the railing and watch the schools of fishes darting about in the clear water , or gaze out over the lake at the stately border of snow-hooded mountain peaks .
Parsing [sent. 2597 len. 45]: Little pleasure steamers , black with people , are coming and going all the time ; and everywhere one sees young girls and young men paddling about in fanciful rowboats , or skimming along by the help of sails when there is any wind .
Parsing [sent. 2598 len. 47]: The front rooms of the hotels have little railed balconies , where one may take his private luncheon in calm , cool comfort and look down upon this busy and pretty scene and enjoy it without having to do any of the work connected with it .
Parsing [sent. 2599 len. 19]: Most of the people , both male and female , are in walking costume , and carry alpenstocks .
Parsing [sent. 2600 len. 21]: Evidently , it is not considered safe to go about in Switzerland , even in town , without an alpenstock .
Parsing [sent. 2601 len. 27]: If the tourist forgets and comes down to breakfast without his alpenstock he goes back and gets it , and stands it up in the corner .
Parsing [sent. 2602 len. 47]: When his touring in Switzerland is finished , he does not throw that broomstick away , but lugs it home with him , to the far corners of the earth , although this costs him more trouble and bother than a baby or a courier could .
Parsing [sent. 2603 len. 49]: You see , the alpenstock is his trophy ; his name is burned upon it ; and if he has climbed a hill , or jumped a brook , or traversed a brickyard with it , he has the names of those places burned upon it , too .
Parsing [sent. 2604 len. 19]: Thus it is his regimental flag , so to speak , and bears the record of his achievements .
Parsing [sent. 2605 len. 27]: It is worth three francs when he buys it , but a bonanza could not purchase it after his great deeds have been inscribed upon it .
Parsing [sent. 2606 len. 21]: There are artisans all about Switzerland whose trade it is to burn these things upon the alpenstock of the tourist .
Parsing [sent. 2607 len. 14]: And observe , a man is respected in Switzerland according to his alpenstock .
Parsing [sent. 2608 len. 16]: I found I could get no attention there , while I carried an unbranded one .
Parsing [sent. 2609 len. 13]: However , branding is not expected , so I soon remedied that .
Parsing [sent. 2610 len. 12]: The effect upon the next detachment of tourists was very marked .
Parsing [sent. 2611 len. 7]: I felt repaid for my trouble .
Parsing [sent. 2612 len. 33]: Half of the summer horde in Switzerland is made up of English people ; the other half is made up of many nationalities , the Germans leading and the Americans coming next .
Parsing [sent. 2613 len. 14]: The Americans were not as numerous as I had expected they would be .
Parsing [sent. 2614 len. 88]: The seven-thirty table d'hôte at the great Schweitzerhof furnished a mighty array and variety of nationalities , but it offered a better opportunity to observe costumes than people , for the multitude sat at immensely long tables , and therefore the faces were mainly seen in perspective ; but the breakfasts were served at small round tables , and then if one had the fortune to get a table in the midst of the assemblage he could have as many faces to study as he could desire .
Parsing [sent. 2615 len. 16]: We used to try to guess out the nationalities , and generally succeeded tolerably well .
Parsing [sent. 2616 len. 28]: Sometimes we tried to guess people 's names ; but that was a failure ; that is a thing which probably requires a good deal of practice .
Parsing [sent. 2617 len. 13]: We presently dropped it and gave our efforts to less difficult particulars .
Parsing [sent. 2618 len. 13]: One morning I said : `` There is an American party . ''
Parsing [sent. 2619 len. 12]: Harris said : `` Yes -- but name the state . ''
Parsing [sent. 2620 len. 9]: I named one state , Harris named another .
Parsing [sent. 2621 len. 24]: We agreed upon one thing , however -- that the young girl with the party was very beautiful , and very tastefully dressed .
Parsing [sent. 2622 len. 8]: But we disagreed as to her age .
Parsing [sent. 2623 len. 12]: I said she was eighteen , Harris said she was twenty .
Parsing [sent. 2624 len. 40]: The dispute between us waxed warm , and I finally said , with a pretense of being in earnest : `` Well , there is one way to settle the matter -- I will go and ask her . ''
Parsing [sent. 2625 len. 15]: Harris said , sarcastically , `` Certainly , that is the thing to do .
Parsing [sent. 2626 len. 25]: All you need to do is to use the common formula over here : go and say , ` I 'm an American ! '
Parsing [sent. 2627 len. 11]: Of course she will be glad to see you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2628 len. 18]: Then he hinted that perhaps there was no great danger of my venturing to speak to her .
Parsing [sent. 2629 len. 32]: I said , `` I was only talking -- I did n't intend to approach her , but I see that you do not know what an intrepid person I am .
Parsing [sent. 2630 len. 10]: I am not afraid of any woman that walks .
Parsing [sent. 2631 len. 11]: I will go and speak to this young girl . ''
Parsing [sent. 2632 len. 11]: The thing I had in my mind was not difficult .
Parsing [sent. 2633 len. 60]: I meant to address her in the most respectful way and ask her to pardon me if her strong resemblance to a former acquaintance of mine was deceiving me ; and when she should reply that the name I mentioned was not the name she bore , I meant to beg pardon again , most respectfully , and retire .
Parsing [sent. 2634 len. 7]: There would be no harm done .
Parsing [sent. 2635 len. 42]: I walked to her table , bowed to the gentleman , then turned to her and was about to begin my little speech when she exclaimed : `` I KNEW I was n't mistaken -- I told John it was you !
Parsing [sent. 2636 len. 14]: John said it probably was n't , but I knew I was right .
Parsing [sent. 2637 len. 38]: I said you would recognize me presently and come over ; and I 'm glad you did , for I should n't have felt much flattered if you had gone out of this room without recognizing me .
Parsing [sent. 2638 len. 25]: Sit down , sit down -- how odd it is -- you are the last person I was ever expecting to see again . ''
Parsing [sent. 2639 len. 6]: This was a stupefying surprise .
Parsing [sent. 2640 len. 11]: It took my wits clear away , for an instant .
Parsing [sent. 2641 len. 14]: However , we shook hands cordially all around , and I sat down .
Parsing [sent. 2642 len. 12]: But truly this was the tightest place I ever was in .
Parsing [sent. 2643 len. 31]: I seemed to vaguely remember the girl 's face , now , but I had no idea where I had seen it before , or what name belonged with it .
Parsing [sent. 2644 len. 72]: I immediately tried to get up a diversion about Swiss scenery , to keep her from launching into topics that might betray that I did not know her , but it was of no use , she went right along upon matters which interested her more : `` Oh dear , what a night that was , when the sea washed the forward boats away -- do you remember it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2645 len. 8]: `` Oh , DO N'T I ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2646 len. 8]: said I -- but I did n't .
Parsing [sent. 2647 len. 24]: I wished the sea had washed the rudder and the smoke-stack and the captain away -- then I could have located this questioner .
Parsing [sent. 2648 len. 18]: `` And do n't you remember how frightened poor Mary was , and how she cried ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2649 len. 6]: `` Indeed I do ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2650 len. 13]: said I. `` Dear me , how it all comes back ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2651 len. 15]: I fervently wished it WOULD come back -- but my memory was a blank .
Parsing [sent. 2652 len. 55]: The wise way would have been to frankly own up ; but I could not bring myself to do that , after the young girl had praised me so for recognizing her ; so I went on , deeper and deeper into the mire , hoping for a chance clue but never getting one .
Parsing [sent. 2653 len. 20]: The Unrecognizable continued , with vivacity : `` Do you know , George married Mary , after all ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2654 len. 5]: `` Why , no !
Parsing [sent. 2655 len. 4]: Did he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2656 len. 5]: `` Indeed he did .
Parsing [sent. 2657 len. 25]: He said he did not believe she was half as much to blame as her father was , and I thought he was right .
Parsing [sent. 2658 len. 5]: Did n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2659 len. 6]: `` Of course he was .
Parsing [sent. 2660 len. 7]: It was a perfectly plain case .
Parsing [sent. 2661 len. 6]: I always said so . ''
Parsing [sent. 2662 len. 8]: `` Why , no you did n't !
Parsing [sent. 2663 len. 7]: -- at least that summer . ''
Parsing [sent. 2664 len. 9]: `` Oh , no , not that summer .
Parsing [sent. 2665 len. 9]: No , you are perfectly right about that .
Parsing [sent. 2666 len. 11]: It was the following winter that I said it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2667 len. 34]: `` Well , as it turned out , Mary was not in the least to blame -- it was all her father 's fault -- at least his and old Darley 's . ''
Parsing [sent. 2668 len. 23]: It was necessary to say something -- so I said : `` I always regarded Darley as a troublesome old thing . ''
Parsing [sent. 2669 len. 23]: `` So he was , but then they always had a great affection for him , although he had so many eccentricities .
Parsing [sent. 2670 len. 21]: You remember that when the weather was the least cold , he would try to come into the house . ''
Parsing [sent. 2671 len. 7]: I was rather afraid to proceed .
Parsing [sent. 2672 len. 24]: Evidently Darley was not a man -- he must be some other kind of animal -- possibly a dog , maybe an elephant .
Parsing [sent. 2673 len. 24]: However , tails are common to all animals , so I ventured to say : `` And what a tail he had ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2674 len. 3]: `` ONE !
Parsing [sent. 2675 len. 6]: He had a thousand ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2676 len. 4]: This was bewildering .
Parsing [sent. 2677 len. 29]: I did not quite know what to say , so I only said : `` Yes , he WAS rather well fixed in the matter of tails . ''
Parsing [sent. 2678 len. 22]: `` For a negro , and a crazy one at that , I should say he was , '' said she .
Parsing [sent. 2679 len. 8]: It was getting pretty sultry for me .
Parsing [sent. 2680 len. 23]: I said to myself , `` Is it possible she is going to stop there , and wait for me to speak ?
Parsing [sent. 2681 len. 9]: If she does , the conversation is blocked .
Parsing [sent. 2682 len. 25]: A negro with a thousand tails is a topic which a person can not talk upon fluently and instructively without more or less preparation .
Parsing [sent. 2683 len. 50]: As to diving rashly into such a vast subject -- '' But here , to my gratitude , she interrupted my thoughts by saying : `` Yes , when it came to tales of his crazy woes , there was simply no end to them if anybody would listen .
Parsing [sent. 2684 len. 32]: His own quarters were comfortable enough , but when the weather was cold , the family were sure to have his company -- nothing could keep him out of the house .
Parsing [sent. 2685 len. 17]: But they always bore it kindly because he had saved Tom 's life , years before .
Parsing [sent. 2686 len. 4]: You remember Tom ?
Parsing [sent. 2687 len. 5]: `` Oh , perfectly .
Parsing [sent. 2688 len. 8]: Fine fellow he was , too . ''
Parsing [sent. 2689 len. 5]: `` Yes he was .
Parsing [sent. 2690 len. 11]: And what a pretty little thing his child was ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2691 len. 7]: `` You may well say that .
Parsing [sent. 2692 len. 8]: I never saw a prettier child . ''
Parsing [sent. 2693 len. 17]: `` I used to delight to pet it and dandle it and play with it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2694 len. 10]: `` So did I. '' `` You named it .
Parsing [sent. 2695 len. 5]: What WAS that name ?
Parsing [sent. 2696 len. 9]: I ca n't call it to mind . ''
Parsing [sent. 2697 len. 14]: It appeared to me that the ice was getting pretty thin , here .
Parsing [sent. 2698 len. 13]: I would have given something to know what the child 's was .
Parsing [sent. 2699 len. 31]: However , I had the good luck to think of a name that would fit either sex -- so I brought it out : `` I named it Frances . ''
Parsing [sent. 2700 len. 8]: `` From a relative , I suppose ?
Parsing [sent. 2701 len. 16]: But you named the one that died , too -- one that I never saw .
Parsing [sent. 2702 len. 8]: What did you call that one ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2703 len. 34]: I was out of neutral names , but as the child was dead and she had never seen it , I thought I might risk a name for it and trust to luck .
Parsing [sent. 2704 len. 13]: Therefore I said : `` I called that one Thomas Henry . ''
Parsing [sent. 2705 len. 15]: She said , musingly : `` That is very singular ... very singular . ''
Parsing [sent. 2706 len. 11]: I sat still and let the cold sweat run down .
Parsing [sent. 2707 len. 28]: I was in a good deal of trouble , but I believed I could worry through if she would n't ask me to name any more children .
Parsing [sent. 2708 len. 11]: I wondered where the lightning was going to strike next .
Parsing [sent. 2709 len. 39]: She was still ruminating over that last child 's title , but presently she said : `` I have always been sorry you were away at the time -- I would have had you name my child . ''
Parsing [sent. 2710 len. 4]: `` YOUR child !
Parsing [sent. 2711 len. 5]: Are you married ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2712 len. 9]: `` I have been married thirteen years . ''
Parsing [sent. 2713 len. 7]: `` Christened , you mean . ''
Parsing [sent. 2714 len. 6]: ` `` No , married .
Parsing [sent. 2715 len. 10]: The youth by your side is my son . ''
Parsing [sent. 2716 len. 8]: `` It seems incredible -- even impossible .
Parsing [sent. 2717 len. 22]: I do not mean any harm by it , but would you mind telling me if you are any over eighteen ?
Parsing [sent. 2718 len. 16]: -- that is to say , will you tell me how old you are ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2719 len. 15]: `` I was just nineteen the day of the storm we were talking about .
Parsing [sent. 2720 len. 6]: That was my birthday . ''
Parsing [sent. 2721 len. 19]: That did not help matters , much , as I did not know the date of the storm .
Parsing [sent. 2722 len. 46]: I tried to think of some non-committal thing to say , to keep up my end of the talk , and render my poverty in the matter of reminiscences as little noticeable as possible , but I seemed to be about out of non-committal things .
Parsing [sent. 2723 len. 22]: I was about to say , `` You have n't changed a bit since then '' -- but that was risky .
Parsing [sent. 2724 len. 25]: I thought of saying , `` You have improved ever so much since then '' -- but that would n't answer , of course .
Parsing [sent. 2725 len. 45]: I was about to try a shy at the weather , for a saving change , when the girl slipped in ahead of me and said : `` How I have enjoyed this talk over those happy old times -- have n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2726 len. 15]: `` I never have spent such a half-hour in all my life before ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2727 len. 34]: said I , with emotion ; and I could have added , with a near approach to truth , `` and I would rather be scalped than spend another one like it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2728 len. 42]: I was holily grateful to be through with the ordeal , and was about to make my good-bys and get out , when the girl said : `` But there is one thing that is ever so puzzling to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2729 len. 8]: `` Why , what is that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2730 len. 7]: `` That dead child 's name .
Parsing [sent. 2731 len. 8]: What did you say it was ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2732 len. 27]: Here was another balmy place to be in : I had forgotten the child 's name ; I had n't imagined it would be needed again .
Parsing [sent. 2733 len. 20]: However , I had to pretend to know , anyway , so I said : `` Joseph William . ''
Parsing [sent. 2734 len. 18]: The youth at my side corrected me , and said : `` No , Thomas Henry . ''
Parsing [sent. 2735 len. 58]: I thanked him -- in words -- and said , with trepidation : `` O yes -- I was thinking of another child that I named -- I have named a great many , and I get them confused -- this one was named Henry Thompson -- '' `` Thomas Henry , '' calmly interposed the boy .
Parsing [sent. 2736 len. 28]: I thanked him again -- strictly in words -- and stammered out : `` Thomas Henry -- yes , Thomas Henry was the poor child 's name .
Parsing [sent. 2737 len. 29]: I named him for Thomas -- er -- Thomas Carlyle , the great author , you know -- and Henry -- er -- er -- Henry the Eighth .
Parsing [sent. 2738 len. 14]: The parents were very grateful to have a child named Thomas Henry . ''
Parsing [sent. 2739 len. 15]: `` That makes it more singular than ever , '' murmured my beautiful friend .
Parsing [sent. 2740 len. 4]: `` Does it ?
Parsing [sent. 2741 len. 3]: Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2742 len. 19]: `` Because when the parents speak of that child now , they always call it Susan Amelia . ''
Parsing [sent. 2743 len. 5]: That spiked my gun .
Parsing [sent. 2744 len. 6]: I could not say anything .
Parsing [sent. 2745 len. 53]: I was entirely out of verbal obliquities ; to go further would be to lie , and that I would not do ; so I simply sat still and suffered -- sat mutely and resignedly there , and sizzled -- for I was being slowly fried to death in my own blushes .
Parsing [sent. 2746 len. 25]: Presently the enemy laughed a happy laugh and said : `` I HAVE enjoyed this talk over old times , but you have not .
Parsing [sent. 2747 len. 36]: I saw very soon that you were only pretending to know me , and so as I had wasted a compliment on you in the beginning , I made up my mind to punish you .
Parsing [sent. 2748 len. 7]: And I have succeeded pretty well .
Parsing [sent. 2749 len. 47]: I was glad to see that you knew George and Tom and Darley , for I had never heard of them before and therefore could not be sure that you had ; and I was glad to learn the names of those imaginary children , too .
Parsing [sent. 2750 len. 18]: One can get quite a fund of information out of you if one goes at it cleverly .
Parsing [sent. 2751 len. 23]: Mary and the storm , and the sweeping away of the forward boats , were facts -- all the rest was fiction .
Parsing [sent. 2752 len. 12]: Mary was my sister ; her full name was Mary ------ .
Parsing [sent. 2753 len. 7]: NOW do you remember me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2754 len. 38]: `` Yes , '' I said , `` I do remember you now ; and you are as hard-headed as you were thirteen years ago in that ship , else you would n't have punished me so .
Parsing [sent. 2755 len. 49]: You have n't changed your nature nor your person , in any way at all ; you look as young as you did then , you are just as beautiful as you were then , and you have transmitted a deal of your comeliness to this fine boy .
Parsing [sent. 2756 len. 29]: There -- if that speech moves you any , let 's fly the flag of truce , with the understanding that I am conquered and confess it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2757 len. 13]: All of which was agreed to and accomplished , on the spot .
Parsing [sent. 2758 len. 25]: When I went back to Harris , I said : `` Now you see what a person with talent and address can do . ''
Parsing [sent. 2759 len. 17]: `` Excuse me , I see what a person of colossal ignorance and simplicity can do .
Parsing [sent. 2760 len. 40]: The idea of your going and intruding on a party of strangers , that way , and talking for half an hour ; why I never heard of a man in his right mind doing such a thing before .
Parsing [sent. 2761 len. 8]: What did you say to them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2762 len. 7]: `` I never said any harm .
Parsing [sent. 2763 len. 11]: I merely asked the girl what her name was . ''
Parsing [sent. 2764 len. 7]: `` I do n't doubt it .
Parsing [sent. 2765 len. 7]: Upon my word I do n't .
Parsing [sent. 2766 len. 8]: I think you were capable of it .
Parsing [sent. 2767 len. 19]: It was stupid in me to let you go over there and make such an exhibition of yourself .
Parsing [sent. 2768 len. 16]: But you know I could n't really believe you would do such an inexcusable thing .
Parsing [sent. 2769 len. 8]: What will those people think of us ?
Parsing [sent. 2770 len. 7]: But how did you say it ?
Parsing [sent. 2771 len. 8]: -- I mean the manner of it .
Parsing [sent. 2772 len. 8]: I hope you were not abrupt . ''
Parsing [sent. 2773 len. 9]: `` No , I was careful about that .
Parsing [sent. 2774 len. 25]: I said , ` My friend and I would like to know what your name is , if you do n't mind . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 2775 len. 8]: `` No , that was not abrupt .
Parsing [sent. 2776 len. 12]: There is a polish about it that does you infinite credit .
Parsing [sent. 2777 len. 22]: And I am glad you put me in ; that was a delicate attention which I appreciate at its full value .
Parsing [sent. 2778 len. 6]: What did she do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2779 len. 9]: `` She did n't do anything in particular .
Parsing [sent. 2780 len. 7]: She told me her name . ''
Parsing [sent. 2781 len. 7]: `` Simply told you her name .
Parsing [sent. 2782 len. 13]: Do you mean to say she did not show any surprise ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2783 len. 33]: `` Well , now I come to think , she did show something ; maybe it was surprise ; I had n't thought of that -- I took it for gratification . ''
Parsing [sent. 2784 len. 34]: `` Oh , undoubtedly you were right ; it must have been gratification ; it could not be otherwise than gratifying to be assaulted by a stranger with such a question as that .
Parsing [sent. 2785 len. 7]: Then what did you do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2786 len. 14]: `` I offered my hand and the party gave me a shake . ''
Parsing [sent. 2787 len. 5]: `` I saw it !
Parsing [sent. 2788 len. 12]: I did not believe my own eyes , at the time .
Parsing [sent. 2789 len. 11]: Did the gentleman say anything about cutting your throat ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2790 len. 19]: `` No , they all seemed glad to see me , as far as I could judge . ''
Parsing [sent. 2791 len. 11]: `` And do you know , I believe they were .
Parsing [sent. 2792 len. 26]: I think they said to themselves , ` Doubtless this curiosity has got away from his keeper -- let us amuse ourselves with him . '
Parsing [sent. 2793 len. 12]: There is no other way of accounting for their facile docility .
Parsing [sent. 2794 len. 4]: You sat down .
Parsing [sent. 2795 len. 9]: Did they ASK you to sit down ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2796 len. 20]: `` No , they did not ask me , but I suppose they did not think of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2797 len. 7]: `` You have an unerring instinct .
Parsing [sent. 2798 len. 6]: What else did you do ?
Parsing [sent. 2799 len. 7]: What did you talk about ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2800 len. 13]: `` Well , I asked the girl how old she was . ''
Parsing [sent. 2801 len. 3]: `` UNdoubtedly .
Parsing [sent. 2802 len. 6]: Your delicacy is beyond praise .
Parsing [sent. 2803 len. 28]: Go on , go on -- do n't mind my apparent misery -- I always look so when I am steeped in a profound and reverent joy .
Parsing [sent. 2804 len. 10]: Go on -- she told you her age ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2805 len. 30]: `` Yes , she told me her age , and all about her mother , and her grandmother , and her other relations , and all about herself . ''
Parsing [sent. 2806 len. 8]: `` Did she volunteer these statistics ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2807 len. 7]: `` No , not exactly that .
Parsing [sent. 2808 len. 10]: I asked the questions and she answered them . ''
Parsing [sent. 2809 len. 5]: `` This is divine .
Parsing [sent. 2810 len. 17]: Go on -- it is not possible that you forgot to inquire into her politics ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2811 len. 8]: `` No , I thought of that .
Parsing [sent. 2812 len. 19]: She is a democrat , her husband is a republican , and both of them are Baptists . ''
Parsing [sent. 2813 len. 4]: `` Her husband ?
Parsing [sent. 2814 len. 6]: Is that child married ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2815 len. 7]: `` She is not a child .
Parsing [sent. 2816 len. 16]: She is married , and that is her husband who is there with her . ''
Parsing [sent. 2817 len. 7]: `` Has she any children . ''
Parsing [sent. 2818 len. 9]: `` Yes -- seven and a half . ''
Parsing [sent. 2819 len. 6]: `` That is impossible . ''
Parsing [sent. 2820 len. 7]: `` No , she has them .
Parsing [sent. 2821 len. 6]: She told me herself . ''
Parsing [sent. 2822 len. 9]: `` Well , but seven and a HALF ?
Parsing [sent. 2823 len. 8]: How do you make out the half ?
Parsing [sent. 2824 len. 8]: Where does the half come in ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2825 len. 35]: `` There is a child which she had by another husband -- not this one but another one -- so it is a stepchild , and they do not count in full measure . ''
Parsing [sent. 2826 len. 4]: `` Another husband ?
Parsing [sent. 2827 len. 6]: Has she another husband ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2828 len. 5]: `` Yes , four .
Parsing [sent. 2829 len. 7]: This one is number four . ''
Parsing [sent. 2830 len. 10]: `` I do n't believe a word of it .
Parsing [sent. 2831 len. 8]: It is impossible , upon its face .
Parsing [sent. 2832 len. 8]: Is that boy there her brother ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2833 len. 8]: `` No , that is her son .
Parsing [sent. 2834 len. 5]: He is her youngest .
Parsing [sent. 2835 len. 18]: He is not as old as he looked ; he is only eleven and a half . ''
Parsing [sent. 2836 len. 8]: `` These things are all manifestly impossible .
Parsing [sent. 2837 len. 6]: This is a wretched business .
Parsing [sent. 2838 len. 19]: It is a plain case : they simply took your measure , and concluded to fill you up .
Parsing [sent. 2839 len. 6]: They seem to have succeeded .
Parsing [sent. 2840 len. 27]: I am glad I am not in the mess ; they may at least be charitable enough to think there ai n't a pair of us .
Parsing [sent. 2841 len. 9]: Are they going to stay here long ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2842 len. 9]: `` No , they leave before noon . ''
Parsing [sent. 2843 len. 12]: `` There is one man who is deeply grateful for that .
Parsing [sent. 2844 len. 6]: How did you find out ?
Parsing [sent. 2845 len. 7]: You asked , I suppose ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2846 len. 85]: `` No , along at first I inquired into their plans , in a general way , and they said they were going to be here a week , and make trips round about ; but toward the end of the interview , when I said you and I would tour around with them with pleasure , and offered to bring you over and introduce you , they hesitated a little , and asked if you were from the same establishment that I was .
Parsing [sent. 2847 len. 31]: I said you were , and then they said they had changed their mind and considered it necessary to start at once and visit a sick relative in Siberia . ''
Parsing [sent. 2848 len. 10]: `` Ah , me , you struck the summit !
Parsing [sent. 2849 len. 14]: You struck the loftiest altitude of stupidity that human effort has ever reached .
Parsing [sent. 2850 len. 22]: You shall have a monument of jackasses ' skulls as high as the Strasburg spire if you die before I do .
Parsing [sent. 2851 len. 20]: They wanted to know I was from the same ` establishment ' that you hailed from , did they ?
Parsing [sent. 2852 len. 10]: What did they mean by ` establishment ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2853 len. 15]: `` I do n't know ; it never occurred to me to ask . ''
Parsing [sent. 2854 len. 5]: `` Well I know .
Parsing [sent. 2855 len. 13]: They meant an asylum -- an IDIOT asylum , do you understand ?
Parsing [sent. 2856 len. 14]: So they DO think there 's a pair of us , after all .
Parsing [sent. 2857 len. 9]: Now what do you think of yourself ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2858 len. 8]: `` Well , I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 2859 len. 19]: I did n't know I was doing any harm ; I did n't MEAN to do any harm .
Parsing [sent. 2860 len. 14]: They were very nice people , and they seemed to like me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2861 len. 19]: Harris made some rude remarks and left for his bedroom -- to break some furniture , he said .
Parsing [sent. 2862 len. 15]: He was a singularly irascible man ; any little thing would disturb his temper .
Parsing [sent. 2863 len. 21]: I had been well scorched by the young woman , but no matter , I took it out on Harris .
Parsing [sent. 2864 len. 20]: One should always `` get even '' in some way , else the sore place will go on hurting .
Parsing [sent. 2865 len. 18]: CHAPTER XXVI -LSB- The Nest of the Cuckoo-clock -RSB- The Hofkirche is celebrated for its organ concerts .
Parsing [sent. 2866 len. 27]: All summer long the tourists flock to that church about six o'clock in the evening , and pay their franc , and listen to the noise .
Parsing [sent. 2867 len. 35]: They do n't stay to hear all of it , but get up and tramp out over the sounding stone floor , meeting late comers who tramp in in a sounding and vigorous way .
Parsing [sent. 2868 len. 35]: This tramping back and forth is kept up nearly all the time , and is accented by the continuous slamming of the door , and the coughing and barking and sneezing of the crowd .
Parsing [sent. 2869 len. 51]: Meantime , the big organ is booming and crashing and thundering away , doing its best to prove that it is the biggest and best organ in Europe , and that a tight little box of a church is the most favorable place to average and appreciate its powers in .
Parsing [sent. 2870 len. 33]: It is true , there were some soft and merciful passages occasionally , but the tramp-tramp of the tourists only allowed one to get fitful glimpses of them , so to speak .
Parsing [sent. 2871 len. 11]: Then right away the organist would let go another avalanche .
Parsing [sent. 2872 len. 31]: The commerce of Lucerne consists mainly in gimcrackery of the souvenir sort ; the shops are packed with Alpine crystals , photographs of scenery , and wooden and ivory carvings .
Parsing [sent. 2873 len. 21]: I will not conceal the fact that miniature figures of the Lion of Lucerne are to be had in them .
Parsing [sent. 2874 len. 4]: Millions of them .
Parsing [sent. 2875 len. 12]: But they are libels upon him , every one of them .
Parsing [sent. 2876 len. 19]: There is a subtle something about the majestic pathos of the original which the copyist can not get .
Parsing [sent. 2877 len. 25]: Even the sun fails to get it ; both the photographer and the carver give you a dying lion , and that is all .
Parsing [sent. 2878 len. 40]: The shape is right , the attitude is right , the proportions are right , but that indescribable something which makes the Lion of Lucerne the most mournful and moving piece of stone in the world , is wanting .
Parsing [sent. 2879 len. 27]: The Lion lies in his lair in the perpendicular face of a low cliff -- for he is carved from the living rock of the cliff .
Parsing [sent. 2880 len. 10]: His size is colossal , his attitude is noble .
Parsing [sent. 2881 len. 24]: His head is bowed , the broken spear is sticking in his shoulder , his protecting paw rests upon the lilies of France .
Parsing [sent. 2882 len. 44]: Vines hang down the cliff and wave in the wind , and a clear stream trickles from above and empties into a pond at the base , and in the smooth surface of the pond the lion is mirrored , among the water-lilies .
Parsing [sent. 2883 len. 8]: Around about are green trees and grass .
Parsing [sent. 2884 len. 46]: The place is a sheltered , reposeful woodland nook , remote from noise and stir and confusion -- and all this is fitting , for lions do die in such places , and not on granite pedestals in public squares fenced with fancy iron railings .
Parsing [sent. 2885 len. 18]: The Lion of Lucerne would be impressive anywhere , but nowhere so impressive as where he is .
Parsing [sent. 2886 len. 11]: Martyrdom is the luckiest fate that can befall some people .
Parsing [sent. 2887 len. 46]: Louis XVI did not die in his bed , consequently history is very gentle with him ; she is charitable toward his failings , and she finds in him high virtues which are not usually considered to be virtues when they are lodged in kings .
Parsing [sent. 2888 len. 27]: She makes him out to be a person with a meek and modest spirit , the heart of a female saint , and a wrong head .
Parsing [sent. 2889 len. 10]: None of these qualities are kingly but the last .
Parsing [sent. 2890 len. 28]: Taken together they make a character which would have fared harshly at the hands of history if its owner had had the ill luck to miss martyrdom .
Parsing [sent. 2891 len. 19]: With the best intentions to do the right thing , he always managed to do the wrong one .
Parsing [sent. 2892 len. 12]: Moreover , nothing could get the female saint out of him .
Parsing [sent. 2893 len. 62]: He knew , well enough , that in national emergencies he must not consider how he ought to act , as a man , but how he ought to act as a king ; so he honestly tried to sink the man and be the king -- but it was a failure , he only succeeded in being the female saint .
Parsing [sent. 2894 len. 12]: He was not instant in season , but out of season .
Parsing [sent. 2895 len. 59]: He could not be persuaded to do a thing while it could do any good -- he was iron , he was adamant in his stubbornness then -- but as soon as the thing had reached a point where it would be positively harmful to do it , do it he would , and nothing could stop him .
Parsing [sent. 2896 len. 36]: He did not do it because it would be harmful , but because he hoped it was not yet too late to achieve by it the good which it would have done if applied earlier .
Parsing [sent. 2897 len. 10]: His comprehension was always a train or two behindhand .
Parsing [sent. 2898 len. 65]: If a national toe required amputating , he could not see that it needed anything more than poulticing ; when others saw that the mortification had reached the knee , he first perceived that the toe needed cutting off -- so he cut it off ; and he severed the leg at the knee when others saw that the disease had reached the thigh .
Parsing [sent. 2899 len. 26]: He was good , and honest , and well meaning , in the matter of chasing national diseases , but he never could overtake one .
Parsing [sent. 2900 len. 22]: As a private man , he would have been lovable ; but viewed as a king , he was strictly contemptible .
Parsing [sent. 2901 len. 72]: His was a most unroyal career , but the most pitiable spectacle in it was his sentimental treachery to his Swiss guard on that memorable 10th of August , when he allowed those heroes to be massacred in his cause , and forbade them to shed the `` sacred French blood '' purporting to be flowing in the veins of the red-capped mob of miscreants that was raging around the palace .
Parsing [sent. 2902 len. 16]: He meant to be kingly , but he was only the female saint once more .
Parsing [sent. 2903 len. 19]: Some of his biographers think that upon this occasion the spirit of Saint Louis had descended upon him .
Parsing [sent. 2904 len. 8]: It must have found pretty cramped quarters .
Parsing [sent. 2905 len. 59]: If Napoleon the First had stood in the shoes of Louis XVI that day , instead of being merely a casual and unknown looker-on , there would be no Lion of Lucerne , now , but there would be a well-stocked Communist graveyard in Paris which would answer just as well to remember the 10th of August by .
Parsing [sent. 2906 len. 25]: Martyrdom made a saint of Mary Queen of Scots three hundred years ago , and she has hardly lost all of her saintship yet .
Parsing [sent. 2907 len. 73]: Martyrdom made a saint of the trivial and foolish Marie Antoinette , and her biographers still keep her fragrant with the odor of sanctity to this day , while unconsciously proving upon almost every page they write that the only calamitous instinct which her husband lacked , she supplied -- the instinct to root out and get rid of an honest , able , and loyal official , wherever she found him .
Parsing [sent. 2908 len. 41]: The hideous but beneficent French Revolution would have been deferred , or would have fallen short of completeness , or even might not have happened at all , if Marie Antoinette had made the unwise mistake of not being born .
Parsing [sent. 2909 len. 28]: The world owes a great deal to the French Revolution , and consequently to its two chief promoters , Louis the Poor in Spirit and his queen .
Parsing [sent. 2910 len. 34]: We did not buy any wooden images of the Lion , nor any ivory or ebony or marble or chalk or sugar or chocolate ones , or even any photographic slanders of him .
Parsing [sent. 2911 len. 41]: The truth is , these copies were so common , so universal , in the shops and everywhere , that they presently became as intolerable to the wearied eye as the latest popular melody usually becomes to the harassed ear .
Parsing [sent. 2912 len. 34]: In Lucerne , too , the wood carvings of other sorts , which had been so pleasant to look upon when one saw them occasionally at home , soon began to fatigue us .
Parsing [sent. 2913 len. 49]: We grew very tired of seeing wooden quails and chickens picking and strutting around clock-faces , and still more tired of seeing wooden images of the alleged chamois skipping about wooden rocks , or lying upon them in family groups , or peering alertly up from behind them .
Parsing [sent. 2914 len. 55]: The first day , I would have bought a hundred and fifty of these clocks if I had the money -- and I did buy three -- but on the third day the disease had run its course , I had convalesced , and was in the market once more -- trying to sell .
Parsing [sent. 2915 len. 30]: However , I had no luck ; which was just as well , for the things will be pretty enough , no doubt , when I get them home .
Parsing [sent. 2916 len. 37]: For years my pet aversion had been the cuckoo clock ; now here I was , at last , right in the creature 's home ; so wherever I went that distressing `` HOO ` hoo !
Parsing [sent. 2917 len. 4]: HOO ` hoo !
Parsing [sent. 2918 len. 5]: HOO ` hoo ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2919 len. 6]: was always in my ears .
Parsing [sent. 2920 len. 13]: For a nervous man , this was a fine state of things .
Parsing [sent. 2921 len. 35]: Some sounds are hatefuler than others , but no sound is quite so inane , and silly , and aggravating as the `` HOO ` hoo '' of a cuckoo clock , I think .
Parsing [sent. 2922 len. 35]: I bought one , and am carrying it home to a certain person ; for I have always said that if the opportunity ever happened , I would do that man an ill turn .
Parsing [sent. 2923 len. 34]: What I meant , was , that I would break one of his legs , or something of that sort ; but in Lucerne I instantly saw that I could impair his mind .
Parsing [sent. 2924 len. 12]: That would be more lasting , and more satisfactory every way .
Parsing [sent. 2925 len. 30]: So I bought the cuckoo clock ; and if I ever get home with it , he is `` my meat , '' as they say in the mines .
Parsing [sent. 2926 len. 31]: I thought of another candidate -- a book-reviewer whom I could name if I wanted to -- but after thinking it over , I did n't buy him a clock .
Parsing [sent. 2927 len. 7]: I could n't injure his mind .
Parsing [sent. 2928 len. 29]: We visited the two long , covered wooden bridges which span the green and brilliant Reuss just below where it goes plunging and hurrahing out of the lake .
Parsing [sent. 2929 len. 21]: These rambling , sway-backed tunnels are very attractive things , with their alcoved outlooks upon the lovely and inspiriting water .
Parsing [sent. 2930 len. 27]: They contain two or three hundred queer old pictures , by old Swiss masters -- old boss sign-painters , who flourished before the decadence of art .
Parsing [sent. 2931 len. 20]: The lake is alive with fishes , plainly visible to the eye , for the water is very clear .
Parsing [sent. 2932 len. 16]: The parapets in front of the hotels were usually fringed with fishers of all ages .
Parsing [sent. 2933 len. 13]: One day I thought I would stop and see a fish caught .
Parsing [sent. 2934 len. 24]: The result brought back to my mind , very forcibly , a circumstance which I had not thought of before for twelve years .
Parsing [sent. 2935 len. 70]: This one : THE MAN WHO PUT UP AT GADSBY 'S When my odd friend Riley and I were newspaper correspondents in Washington , in the winter of ' 67 , we were coming down Pennsylvania Avenue one night , near midnight , in a driving storm of snow , when the flash of a street-lamp fell upon a man who was eagerly tearing along in the opposite direction .
Parsing [sent. 2936 len. 5]: `` This is lucky !
Parsing [sent. 2937 len. 10]: You are Mr. Riley , ai n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2938 len. 13]: Riley was the most self-possessed and solemnly deliberate person in the republic .
Parsing [sent. 2939 len. 22]: He stopped , looked his man over from head to foot , and finally said : `` I am Mr. Riley .
Parsing [sent. 2940 len. 10]: Did you happen to be looking for me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2941 len. 32]: `` That 's just what I was doing , '' said the man , joyously , `` and it 's the biggest luck in the world that I 've found you .
Parsing [sent. 2942 len. 5]: My name is Lykins .
Parsing [sent. 2943 len. 14]: I 'm one of the teachers of the high school -- San Francisco .
Parsing [sent. 2944 len. 27]: As soon as I heard the San Francisco postmastership was vacant , I made up my mind to get it -- and here I am . ''
Parsing [sent. 2945 len. 22]: `` Yes , '' said Riley , slowly , `` as you have remarked ... Mr. Lykins ... here you are .
Parsing [sent. 2946 len. 7]: And have you got it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2947 len. 15]: `` Well , not exactly GOT it , but the next thing to it .
Parsing [sent. 2948 len. 28]: I 've brought a petition , signed by the Superintendent of Public Instruction , and all the teachers , and by more than two hundred other people .
Parsing [sent. 2949 len. 36]: Now I want you , if you 'll be so good , to go around with me to the Pacific delegation , for I want to rush this thing through and get along home . ''
Parsing [sent. 2950 len. 37]: `` If the matter is so pressing , you will prefer that we visit the delegation tonight , '' said Riley , in a voice which had nothing mocking in it -- to an unaccustomed ear .
Parsing [sent. 2951 len. 9]: `` Oh , tonight , by all means !
Parsing [sent. 2952 len. 10]: I have n't got any time to fool around .
Parsing [sent. 2953 len. 24]: I want their promise before I go to bed -- I ai n't the talking kind , I 'm the DOING kind ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2954 len. 13]: `` Yes ... you 've come to the right place for that .
Parsing [sent. 2955 len. 6]: When did you arrive ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2956 len. 7]: `` Just an hour ago . ''
Parsing [sent. 2957 len. 9]: `` When are you intending to leave ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2958 len. 14]: `` For New York tomorrow evening -- for San Francisco next morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 2959 len. 13]: `` Just so ... What are you going to do tomorrow ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2960 len. 3]: `` DO !
Parsing [sent. 2961 len. 27]: Why , I 've got to go to the President with the petition and the delegation , and get the appointment , have n't I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2962 len. 10]: `` Yes ... very true ... that is correct .
Parsing [sent. 2963 len. 5]: And then what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2964 len. 25]: `` Executive session of the Senate at 2 P.M. -- got to get the appointment confirmed -- I reckon you 'll grant that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2965 len. 17]: `` Yes ... yes , '' said Riley , meditatively , `` you are right again .
Parsing [sent. 2966 len. 22]: Then you take the train for New York in the evening , and the steamer for San Francisco next morning ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2967 len. 15]: `` That 's it -- that 's the way I map it out ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2968 len. 26]: Riley considered a while , and then said : `` You could n't stay ... a day ... well , say two days longer ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2969 len. 7]: `` Bless your soul , no !
Parsing [sent. 2970 len. 6]: It 's not my style .
Parsing [sent. 2971 len. 23]: I ai n't a man to go fooling around -- I 'm a man that DOES things , I tell you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2972 len. 12]: The storm was raging , the thick snow blowing in gusts .
Parsing [sent. 2973 len. 40]: Riley stood silent , apparently deep in a reverie , during a minute or more , then he looked up and said : `` Have you ever heard about that man who put up at Gadsby 's , once ?
Parsing [sent. 2974 len. 9]: ... But I see you have n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 2975 len. 64]: He backed Mr. Lykins against an iron fence , buttonholed him , fastened him with his eye , like the Ancient Mariner , and proceeded to unfold his narrative as placidly and peacefully as if we were all stretched comfortably in a blossomy summer meadow instead of being persecuted by a wintry midnight tempest : `` I will tell you about that man .
Parsing [sent. 2976 len. 7]: It was in Jackson 's time .
Parsing [sent. 2977 len. 9]: Gadsby 's was the principal hotel , then .
Parsing [sent. 2978 len. 136]: Well , this man arrived from Tennessee about nine o'clock , one morning , with a black coachman and a splendid four-horse carriage and an elegant dog , which he was evidently fond of and proud of ; he drove up before Gadsby 's , and the clerk and the landlord and everybody rushed out to take charge of him , but he said , ` Never mind , ' and jumped out and told the coachman to wait -- said he had n't time to take anything to eat , he only had a little claim against the government to collect , would run across the way , to the Treasury , and fetch the money , and then get right along back to Tennessee , for he was in considerable of a hurry .
Parsing [sent. 2979 len. 34]: `` Well , about eleven o'clock that night he came back and ordered a bed and told them to put the horses up -- said he would collect the claim in the morning .
Parsing [sent. 2980 len. 19]: This was in January , you understand -- January , 1834 -- the 3d of January -- Wednesday .
Parsing [sent. 2981 len. 44]: `` Well , on the 5th of February , he sold the fine carriage , and bought a cheap second-hand one -- said it would answer just as well to take the money home in , and he did n't care for style .
Parsing [sent. 2982 len. 68]: `` On the 11th of August he sold a pair of the fine horses -- said he 'd often thought a pair was better than four , to go over the rough mountain roads with where a body had to be careful about his driving -- and there was n't so much of his claim but he could lug the money home with a pair easy enough .
Parsing [sent. 2983 len. 53]: `` On the 13th of December he sold another horse -- said two war n't necessary to drag that old light vehicle with -- in fact , one could snatch it along faster than was absolutely necessary , now that it was good solid winter weather and the roads in splendid condition .
Parsing [sent. 2984 len. 55]: `` On the 17th of February , 1835 , he sold the old carriage and bought a cheap second-hand buggy -- said a buggy was just the trick to skim along mushy , slushy early spring roads with , and he had always wanted to try a buggy on those mountain roads , anyway .
Parsing [sent. 2985 len. 55]: `` On the 1st August he sold the buggy and bought the remains of an old sulky -- said he just wanted to see those green Tennesseans stare and gawk when they saw him come a-ripping along in a sulky -- did n't believe they 'd ever heard of a sulky in their lives .
Parsing [sent. 2986 len. 88]: `` Well , on the 29th of August he sold his colored coachman -- said he did n't need a coachman for a sulky -- would n't be room enough for two in it anyway -- and , besides , it was n't every day that Providence sent a man a fool who was willing to pay nine hundred dollars for such a third-rate negro as that -- been wanting to get rid of the creature for years , but did n't like to THROW him away .
Parsing [sent. 2987 len. 69]: `` Eighteen months later -- that is to say , on the 15th of February , 1837 -- he sold the sulky and bought a saddle -- said horseback-riding was what the doctor had always recommended HIM to take , and dog 'd if he wanted to risk HIS neck going over those mountain roads on wheels in the dead of winter , not if he knew himself .
Parsing [sent. 2988 len. 61]: `` On the 9th of April he sold the saddle -- said he was n't going to risk HIS life with any perishable saddle-girth that ever was made , over a rainy , miry April road , while he could ride bareback and know and feel he was safe -- always HAD despised to ride on a saddle , anyway .
Parsing [sent. 2989 len. 104]: `` On the 24th of April he sold his horse -- said ` I 'm just fifty-seven today , hale and hearty -- it would be a PRETTY howdy-do for me to be wasting such a trip as that and such weather as this , on a horse , when there ai n't anything in the world so splendid as a tramp on foot through the fresh spring woods and over the cheery mountains , to a man that IS a man -- and I can make my dog carry my claim in a little bundle , anyway , when it 's collected .
Parsing [sent. 2990 len. 37]: So tomorrow I 'll be up bright and early , make my little old collection , and mosey off to Tennessee , on my own hind legs , with a rousing good-by to Gadsby 's . '
Parsing [sent. 2991 len. 133]: `` On the 22d of June he sold his dog -- said ` Dern a dog , anyway , where you 're just starting off on a rattling bully pleasure tramp through the summer woods and hills -- perfect nuisance -- chases the squirrels , barks at everything , goes a-capering and splattering around in the fords -- man ca n't get any chance to reflect and enjoy nature -- and I 'd a blamed sight ruther carry the claim myself , it 's a mighty sight safer ; a dog 's mighty uncertain in a financial way -- always noticed it -- well , GOOD-by , boys -- last call -- I 'm off for Tennessee with a good leg and a gay heart , early in the morning . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 2992 len. 19]: There was a pause and a silence -- except the noise of the wind and the pelting snow .
Parsing [sent. 2993 len. 10]: Mr. Lykins said , impatiently : `` Well ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2994 len. 14]: Riley said : `` Well , -- that was thirty years ago . ''
Parsing [sent. 2995 len. 12]: `` Very well , very well -- what of it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2996 len. 10]: `` I 'm great friends with that old patriarch .
Parsing [sent. 2997 len. 9]: He comes every evening to tell me good-by .
Parsing [sent. 2998 len. 40]: I saw him an hour ago -- he 's off for Tennessee early tomorrow morning -- as usual ; said he calculated to get his claim through and be off before night-owls like me have turned out of bed .
Parsing [sent. 2999 len. 26]: The tears were in his eyes , he was so glad he was going to see his old Tennessee and his friends once more . ''
Parsing [sent. 3000 len. 4]: Another silent pause .
Parsing [sent. 3001 len. 11]: The stranger broke it : `` Is that all ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3002 len. 6]: `` That is all . ''
Parsing [sent. 3003 len. 26]: `` Well , for the TIME of night , and the KIND of night , it seems to me the story was full long enough .
Parsing [sent. 3004 len. 8]: But what 's it all FOR ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3005 len. 8]: `` Oh , nothing in particular . ''
Parsing [sent. 3006 len. 11]: `` Well , where 's the point of it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3007 len. 12]: `` Oh , there is n't any particular point to it .
Parsing [sent. 3008 len. 47]: Only , if you are not in TOO much of a hurry to rush off to San Francisco with that post-office appointment , Mr. Lykins , I 'd advise you to ` PUT UP AT GADSBY 'S ' for a spell , and take it easy .
Parsing [sent. 3009 len. 2]: Good-by .
Parsing [sent. 3010 len. 5]: GOD bless you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3011 len. 32]: So saying , Riley blandly turned on his heel and left the astonished school-teacher standing there , a musing and motionless snow image shining in the broad glow of the street-lamp .
Parsing [sent. 3012 len. 6]: He never got that post-office .
Parsing [sent. 3013 len. 55]: To go back to Lucerne and its fishers , I concluded , after about nine hours ' waiting , that the man who proposes to tarry till he sees something hook one of those well-fed and experienced fishes will find it wisdom to `` put up at Gadsby 's '' and take it easy .
Parsing [sent. 3014 len. 44]: It is likely that a fish has not been caught on that lake pier for forty years ; but no matter , the patient fisher watches his cork there all the day long , just the same , and seems to enjoy it .
Parsing [sent. 3015 len. 53]: One may see the fisher-loafers just as thick and contented and happy and patient all along the Seine at Paris , but tradition says that the only thing ever caught there in modern times is a thing they do n't fish for at all -- the recent dog and the translated cat .
Parsing [sent. 3016 len. 35]: CHAPTER XXVII -LSB- I Spare an Awful Bore -RSB- Close by the Lion of Lucerne is what they call the `` Glacier Garden '' -- and it is the only one in the world .
Parsing [sent. 3017 len. 6]: It is on high ground .
Parsing [sent. 3018 len. 25]: Four or five years ago , some workmen who were digging foundations for a house came upon this interesting relic of a long-departed age .
Parsing [sent. 3019 len. 34]: Scientific men perceived in it a confirmation of their theories concerning the glacial period ; so through their persuasions the little tract of ground was bought and permanently protected against being built upon .
Parsing [sent. 3020 len. 30]: The soil was removed , and there lay the rasped and guttered track which the ancient glacier had made as it moved along upon its slow and tedious journey .
Parsing [sent. 3021 len. 31]: This track was perforated by huge pot-shaped holes in the bed-rock , formed by the furious washing-around in them of boulders by the turbulent torrent which flows beneath all glaciers .
Parsing [sent. 3022 len. 34]: These huge round boulders still remain in the holes ; they and the walls of the holes are worn smooth by the long-continued chafing which they gave each other in those old days .
Parsing [sent. 3023 len. 18]: It took a mighty force to churn these big lumps of stone around in that vigorous way .
Parsing [sent. 3024 len. 31]: The neighboring country had a very different shape , at that time -- the valleys have risen up and become hills , since , and the hills have become valleys .
Parsing [sent. 3025 len. 26]: The boulders discovered in the pots had traveled a great distance , for there is no rock like them nearer than the distant Rhone Glacier .
Parsing [sent. 3026 len. 85]: For some days we were content to enjoy looking at the blue lake Lucerne and at the piled-up masses of snow-mountains that border it all around -- an enticing spectacle , this last , for there is a strange and fascinating beauty and charm about a majestic snow-peak with the sun blazing upon it or the moonlight softly enriching it -- but finally we concluded to try a bit of excursioning around on a steamboat , and a dash on foot at the Rigi .
Parsing [sent. 3027 len. 18]: Very well , we had a delightful trip to Fluelen , on a breezy , sunny day .
Parsing [sent. 3028 len. 41]: Everybody sat on the upper deck , on benches , under an awning ; everybody talked , laughed , and exclaimed at the wonderful scenery ; in truth , a trip on that lake is almost the perfection of pleasuring .
Parsing [sent. 3029 len. 7]: The mountains were a never-ceasing marvel .
Parsing [sent. 3030 len. 28]: Sometimes they rose straight up out of the lake , and towered aloft and overshadowed our pygmy steamer with their prodigious bulk in the most impressive way .
Parsing [sent. 3031 len. 25]: Not snow-clad mountains , these , yet they climbed high enough toward the sky to meet the clouds and veil their foreheads in them .
Parsing [sent. 3032 len. 20]: They were not barren and repulsive , but clothed in green , and restful and pleasant to the eye .
Parsing [sent. 3033 len. 44]: And they were so almost straight-up-and-down , sometimes , that one could not imagine a man being able to keep his footing upon such a surface , yet there are paths , and the Swiss people go up and down them every day .
Parsing [sent. 3034 len. 75]: Sometimes one of these monster precipices had the slight inclination of the huge ship-houses in dockyards -- then high aloft , toward the sky , it took a little stronger inclination , like that of a mansard roof -- and perched on this dizzy mansard one 's eye detected little things like martin boxes , and presently perceived that these were the dwellings of peasants -- an airy place for a home , truly .
Parsing [sent. 3035 len. 21]: And suppose a peasant should walk in his sleep , or his child should fall out of the front yard ?
Parsing [sent. 3036 len. 20]: -- the friends would have a tedious long journey down out of those cloud-heights before they found the remains .
Parsing [sent. 3037 len. 50]: And yet those far-away homes looked ever so seductive , they were so remote from the troubled world , they dozed in such an atmosphere of peace and dreams -- surely no one who has learned to live up there would ever want to live on a meaner level .
Parsing [sent. 3038 len. 81]: We swept through the prettiest little curving arms of the lake , among these colossal green walls , enjoying new delights , always , as the stately panorama unfolded itself before us and rerolled and hid itself behind us ; and now and then we had the thrilling surprise of bursting suddenly upon a tremendous white mass like the distant and dominating Jungfrau , or some kindred giant , looming head and shoulders above a tumbled waste of lesser Alps .
Parsing [sent. 3039 len. 122]: Once , while I was hungrily taking in one of these surprises , and doing my best to get all I possibly could of it while it should last , I was interrupted by a young and care-free voice : `` You 're an American , I think -- so 'm I. '' He was about eighteen , or possibly nineteen ; slender and of medium height ; open , frank , happy face ; a restless but independent eye ; a snub nose , which had the air of drawing back with a decent reserve from the silky new-born mustache below it until it should be introduced ; a loosely hung jaw , calculated to work easily in the sockets .
Parsing [sent. 3040 len. 96]: He wore a low-crowned , narrow-brimmed straw hat , with a broad blue ribbon around it which had a white anchor embroidered on it in front ; nobby short-tailed coat , pantaloons , vest , all trim and neat and up with the fashion ; red-striped stockings , very low-quarter patent-leather shoes , tied with black ribbon ; blue ribbon around his neck , wide-open collar ; tiny diamond studs ; wrinkleless kids ; projecting cuffs , fastened with large oxidized silver sleeve-buttons , bearing the device of a dog 's face -- English pug .
Parsing [sent. 3041 len. 18]: He carried a slim cane , surmounted with an English pug 's head with red glass eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3042 len. 12]: Under his arm he carried a German grammar -- Otto 's .
Parsing [sent. 3043 len. 29]: His hair was short , straight , and smooth , and presently when he turned his head a moment , I saw that it was nicely parted behind .
Parsing [sent. 3044 len. 30]: He took a cigarette out of a dainty box , stuck it into a meerschaum holder which he carried in a morocco case , and reached for my cigar .
Parsing [sent. 3045 len. 17]: While he was lighting , I said : `` Yes -- I am an American . ''
Parsing [sent. 3046 len. 11]: `` I knew it -- I can always tell them .
Parsing [sent. 3047 len. 9]: What ship did you come over in ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3048 len. 4]: `` HOLSATIA . ''
Parsing [sent. 3049 len. 12]: `` We came in the BATAVIA -- Cunard , you know .
Parsing [sent. 3050 len. 9]: What kind of passage did you have ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3051 len. 5]: `` Tolerably rough . ''
Parsing [sent. 3052 len. 5]: `` So did we .
Parsing [sent. 3053 len. 10]: Captain said he 'd hardly ever seen it rougher .
Parsing [sent. 3054 len. 6]: Where are you from ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3055 len. 5]: `` New England . ''
Parsing [sent. 3056 len. 10]: `` So 'm I. I 'm from New Bloomfield .
Parsing [sent. 3057 len. 5]: Anybody with you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3058 len. 7]: `` Yes -- a friend . ''
Parsing [sent. 3059 len. 7]: `` Our whole family 's along .
Parsing [sent. 3060 len. 16]: It 's awful slow , going around alone -- do n't you think so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3061 len. 5]: `` Rather slow . ''
Parsing [sent. 3062 len. 8]: `` Ever been over here before ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3063 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 3064 len. 5]: `` I have n't .
Parsing [sent. 3065 len. 4]: My first trip .
Parsing [sent. 3066 len. 11]: But we 've been all around -- Paris and everywhere .
Parsing [sent. 3067 len. 8]: I 'm to enter Harvard next year .
Parsing [sent. 3068 len. 8]: Studying German all the time , now .
Parsing [sent. 3069 len. 8]: Ca n't enter till I know German .
Parsing [sent. 3070 len. 20]: I know considerable French -- I get along pretty well in Paris , or anywhere where they speak French .
Parsing [sent. 3071 len. 8]: What hotel are you stopping at ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3072 len. 4]: `` Schweitzerhof . ''
Parsing [sent. 3073 len. 3]: `` No !
Parsing [sent. 3074 len. 4]: is that so ?
Parsing [sent. 3075 len. 8]: I never see you in the reception-room .
Parsing [sent. 3076 len. 20]: I go to the reception-room a good deal of the time , because there 's so many Americans there .
Parsing [sent. 3077 len. 6]: I make lots of acquaintances .
Parsing [sent. 3078 len. 22]: I know an American as soon as I see him -- and so I speak to him and make his acquaintance .
Parsing [sent. 3079 len. 13]: I like to be always making acquaintances -- do n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3080 len. 6]: `` Lord , yes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3081 len. 14]: `` You see it breaks up a trip like this , first rate .
Parsing [sent. 3082 len. 22]: I never got bored on a trip like this , if I can make acquaintances and have somebody to talk to .
Parsing [sent. 3083 len. 33]: But I think a trip like this would be an awful bore , if a body could n't find anybody to get acquainted with and talk to on a trip like this .
Parsing [sent. 3084 len. 10]: I 'm fond of talking , ai n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 3085 len. 4]: `` Passionately . ''
Parsing [sent. 3086 len. 11]: `` Have you felt bored , on this trip ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3087 len. 11]: `` Not all the time , part of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3088 len. 5]: `` That 's it !
Parsing [sent. 3089 len. 15]: -- you see you ought to go around and get acquainted , and talk .
Parsing [sent. 3090 len. 5]: That 's my way .
Parsing [sent. 3091 len. 31]: That 's the way I always do -- I just go ` round , ` round , ` round and talk , talk , talk -- I never get bored .
Parsing [sent. 3092 len. 8]: You been up the Rigi yet ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3093 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 3094 len. 4]: `` Going ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3095 len. 6]: `` I think so . ''
Parsing [sent. 3096 len. 10]: `` What hotel you going to stop at ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3097 len. 6]: `` I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 3098 len. 7]: Is there more than one ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3099 len. 3]: `` Three .
Parsing [sent. 3100 len. 14]: You stop at the Schreiber -- you 'll find it full of Americans .
Parsing [sent. 3101 len. 11]: What ship did you say you came over in ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3102 len. 6]: `` CITY OF ANTWERP . ''
Parsing [sent. 3103 len. 6]: `` German , I guess .
Parsing [sent. 3104 len. 6]: You going to Geneva ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3105 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 3106 len. 10]: `` What hotel you going to stop at ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3107 len. 8]: `` Hôtel de l'Écu de Génève . ''
Parsing [sent. 3108 len. 7]: `` Do n't you do it !
Parsing [sent. 3109 len. 4]: No Americans there !
Parsing [sent. 3110 len. 20]: You stop at one of those big hotels over the bridge -- they 're packed full of Americans . ''
Parsing [sent. 3111 len. 10]: `` But I want to practice my Arabic . ''
Parsing [sent. 3112 len. 10]: `` Good gracious , do you speak Arabic ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3113 len. 10]: `` Yes -- well enough to get along . ''
Parsing [sent. 3114 len. 24]: `` Why , hang it , you wo n't get along in Geneva -- THEY do n't speak Arabic , they speak French .
Parsing [sent. 3115 len. 9]: What hotel are you stopping at here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3116 len. 5]: `` Hotel Pension-Beaurivage . ''
Parsing [sent. 3117 len. 11]: `` Sho , you ought to stop at the Schweitzerhof .
Parsing [sent. 3118 len. 13]: Did n't you know the Schweitzerhof was the best hotel in Switzerland ?
Parsing [sent. 3119 len. 7]: -- look at your Baedeker . ''
Parsing [sent. 3120 len. 19]: `` Yes , I know -- but I had an idea there war n't any Americans there . ''
Parsing [sent. 3121 len. 4]: `` No Americans !

Parsing [sent. 3123 len. 11]: I 'm in the great reception-room most all the time .
Parsing [sent. 3124 len. 7]: I make lots of acquaintances there .
Parsing [sent. 3125 len. 26]: Not as many as I did at first , because now only the new ones stop in there -- the others go right along through .
Parsing [sent. 3126 len. 6]: Where are you from ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3127 len. 4]: `` Arkansaw . ''
Parsing [sent. 3128 len. 5]: `` Is that so ?
Parsing [sent. 3129 len. 17]: I 'm from New England -- New Bloomfield 's my town when I 'm at home .

Parsing [sent. 3131 len. 4]: `` Divine . ''
Parsing [sent. 3132 len. 8]: `` That 's what I call it .
Parsing [sent. 3133 len. 16]: I like this knocking around , loose and easy , and making acquaintances and talking .
Parsing [sent. 3134 len. 23]: I know an American , soon as I see him ; so I go and speak to him and make his acquaintance .
Parsing [sent. 3135 len. 21]: I ai n't ever bored , on a trip like this , if I can make new acquaintances and talk .
Parsing [sent. 3136 len. 24]: I 'm awful fond of talking when I can get hold of the right kind of a person , ai n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3137 len. 10]: `` I prefer it to any other dissipation . ''
Parsing [sent. 3138 len. 8]: `` That 's my notion , too .
Parsing [sent. 3139 len. 70]: Now some people like to take a book and sit down and read , and read , and read , or moon around yawping at the lake or these mountains and things , but that ai n't my way ; no , sir , if they like it , let 'em do it , I do n't object ; but as for me , talking 's what I like .
Parsing [sent. 3140 len. 7]: You been up the Rigi ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3141 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 3142 len. 9]: `` What hotel did you stop at ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3143 len. 4]: `` Schreiber . ''
Parsing [sent. 3144 len. 6]: `` That 's the place !
Parsing [sent. 3145 len. 6]: -- I stopped there too .

Parsing [sent. 3147 len. 7]: It always is -- always is .
Parsing [sent. 3148 len. 6]: That 's what they say .
Parsing [sent. 3149 len. 4]: Everybody says that .
Parsing [sent. 3150 len. 9]: What ship did you come over in ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3151 len. 6]: `` VILLE DE PARIS . ''
Parsing [sent. 3152 len. 6]: `` French , I reckon .
Parsing [sent. 3153 len. 23]: What kind of a passage did ... excuse me a minute , there 's some Americans I have n't seen before . ''
Parsing [sent. 3154 len. 5]: And away he went .
Parsing [sent. 3155 len. 54]: He went uninjured , too -- I had the murderous impulse to harpoon him in the back with my alpenstock , but as I raised the weapon the disposition left me ; I found I had n't the heart to kill him , he was such a joyous , innocent , good-natured numbskull .
Parsing [sent. 3156 len. 71]: Half an hour later I was sitting on a bench inspecting , with strong interest , a noble monolith which we were skimming by -- a monolith not shaped by man , but by Nature 's free great hand -- a massy pyramidal rock eighty feet high , devised by Nature ten million years ago against the day when a man worthy of it should need it for his monument .
Parsing [sent. 3157 len. 22]: The time came at last , and now this grand remembrancer bears Schiller 's name in huge letters upon its face .
Parsing [sent. 3158 len. 14]: Curiously enough , this rock was not degraded or defiled in any way .
Parsing [sent. 3159 len. 68]: It is said that two years ago a stranger let himself down from the top of it with ropes and pulleys , and painted all over it , in blue letters bigger than those in Schiller 's name , these words : `` Try Sozodont ; '' `` Buy Sun Stove Polish ; '' `` Helmbold 's Buchu ; '' `` Try Benzaline for the Blood . ''
Parsing [sent. 3160 len. 13]: He was captured and it turned out that he was an American .
Parsing [sent. 3161 len. 52]: Upon his trial the judge said to him : `` You are from a land where any insolent that wants to is privileged to profane and insult Nature , and , through her , Nature 's God , if by so doing he can put a sordid penny in his pocket .
Parsing [sent. 3162 len. 7]: But here the case is different .
Parsing [sent. 3163 len. 27]: Because you are a foreigner and ignorant , I will make your sentence light ; if you were a native I would deal strenuously with you .
Parsing [sent. 3164 len. 70]: Hear and obey : -- You will immediately remove every trace of your offensive work from the Schiller monument ; you pay a fine of ten thousand francs ; you will suffer two years ' imprisonment at hard labor ; you will then be horsewhipped , tarred and feathered , deprived of your ears , ridden on a rail to the confines of the canton , and banished forever .
Parsing [sent. 3165 len. 31]: The severest penalties are omitted in your case -- not as a grace to you , but to that great republic which had the misfortune to give you birth . ''
Parsing [sent. 3166 len. 13]: The steamer 's benches were ranged back to back across the deck .
Parsing [sent. 3167 len. 16]: My back hair was mingling innocently with the back hair of a couple of ladies .
Parsing [sent. 3168 len. 21]: Presently they were addressed by some one and I overheard this conversation : `` You are Americans , I think ?
Parsing [sent. 3169 len. 12]: So 'm I. '' `` Yes -- we are Americans . ''
Parsing [sent. 3170 len. 11]: `` I knew it -- I can always tell them .
Parsing [sent. 3171 len. 9]: What ship did you come over in ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3172 len. 6]: `` CITY OF CHESTER . ''
Parsing [sent. 3173 len. 8]: `` Oh , yes -- Inman line .
Parsing [sent. 3174 len. 10]: We came in the BATAVIA -- Cunard you know .
Parsing [sent. 3175 len. 10]: What kind of a passage did you have ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3176 len. 5]: `` Pretty fair . ''
Parsing [sent. 3177 len. 5]: `` That was luck .
Parsing [sent. 3178 len. 6]: We had it awful rough .
Parsing [sent. 3179 len. 9]: Captain said he 'd hardly seen it rougher .
Parsing [sent. 3180 len. 6]: Where are you from ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3181 len. 5]: `` New Jersey . ''
Parsing [sent. 3182 len. 18]: `` So 'm I. No -- I did n't mean that ; I 'm from New England .
Parsing [sent. 3183 len. 6]: New Bloomfield 's my place .
Parsing [sent. 3184 len. 4]: These your children ?
Parsing [sent. 3185 len. 8]: -- belong to both of you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3186 len. 18]: `` Only to one of us ; they are mine ; my friend is not married . ''
Parsing [sent. 3187 len. 6]: `` Single , I reckon ?
Parsing [sent. 3188 len. 11]: So 'm I. Are you two ladies traveling alone ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3189 len. 10]: `` No -- my husband is with us . ''
Parsing [sent. 3190 len. 7]: `` Our whole family 's along .
Parsing [sent. 3191 len. 16]: It 's awful slow , going around alone -- do n't you think so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3192 len. 8]: `` I suppose it must be . ''
Parsing [sent. 3193 len. 12]: `` Hi , there 's Mount Pilatus coming in sight again .
Parsing [sent. 3194 len. 19]: Named after Pontius Pilate , you know , that shot the apple off of William Tell 's head .
Parsing [sent. 3195 len. 9]: Guide-book tells all about it , they say .
Parsing [sent. 3196 len. 11]: I did n't read it -- an American told me .
Parsing [sent. 3197 len. 17]: I do n't read when I 'm knocking around like this , having a good time .
Parsing [sent. 3198 len. 14]: Did you ever see the chapel where William Tell used to preach ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3199 len. 11]: `` I did not know he ever preached there . ''
Parsing [sent. 3200 len. 8]: `` Oh , yes , he did .
Parsing [sent. 3201 len. 6]: That American told me so .
Parsing [sent. 3202 len. 9]: He do n't ever shut up his guide-book .

Parsing [sent. 3214 len. 17]: It 's a mighty good book to get the ICH HABE GEHABT HABEN 's out of .
Parsing [sent. 3215 len. 14]: But I do n't really study when I 'm knocking around this way .
Parsing [sent. 3216 len. 62]: If the notion takes me , I just run over my little old ICH HABE GEHABT , DU HAST GEHABT , ER HAT GEHABT , WIR HABEN GEHABT , IHR HABEN GEHABT , SIE HABEN GEHABT -- kind of ` Now-I-lay-me-down-to-sleep ' fashion , you know , and after that , maybe I do n't buckle to it for three days .
Parsing [sent. 3217 len. 46]: It 's awful undermining to the intellect , German is ; you want to take it in small doses , or first you know your brains all run together , and you feel them sloshing around in your head same as so much drawn butter .
Parsing [sent. 3218 len. 10]: But French is different ; FRENCH ai n't anything .
Parsing [sent. 3219 len. 42]: I ai n't any more afraid of French than a tramp 's afraid of pie ; I can rattle off my little J'AI , TU AS , IL A , and the rest of it , just as easy as a-b-c .
Parsing [sent. 3220 len. 15]: I get along pretty well in Paris , or anywhere where they speak French .
Parsing [sent. 3221 len. 8]: What hotel are you stopping at ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3222 len. 5]: `` The Schweitzerhof . ''
Parsing [sent. 3223 len. 3]: `` No !
Parsing [sent. 3224 len. 4]: is that so ?
Parsing [sent. 3225 len. 9]: I never see you in the big reception-room .
Parsing [sent. 3226 len. 19]: I go in there a good deal of the time , because there 's so many Americans there .
Parsing [sent. 3227 len. 6]: I make lots of acquaintances .
Parsing [sent. 3228 len. 8]: You been up the Rigi yet ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3229 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 3230 len. 4]: `` Going ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3231 len. 7]: `` We think of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3232 len. 10]: `` What hotel you going to stop at ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3233 len. 7]: `` I do n't know . ''
Parsing [sent. 3234 len. 16]: `` Well , then you stop at the Schreiber -- it 's full of Americans .
Parsing [sent. 3235 len. 9]: What ship did you come over in ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3236 len. 6]: `` CITY OF CHESTER . ''
Parsing [sent. 3237 len. 13]: `` Oh , yes , I remember I asked you that before .
Parsing [sent. 3238 len. 21]: But I always ask everybody what ship they came over in , and so sometimes I forget and ask again .
Parsing [sent. 3239 len. 6]: You going to Geneva ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3240 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 3241 len. 10]: `` What hotel you going to stop at ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3242 len. 10]: `` We expect to stop in a pension . ''
Parsing [sent. 3243 len. 20]: `` I do n't hardly believe you 'll like that ; there 's very few Americans in the pensions .
Parsing [sent. 3244 len. 9]: What hotel are you stopping at here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3245 len. 5]: `` The Schweitzerhof . ''
Parsing [sent. 3246 len. 5]: `` Oh , yes .
Parsing [sent. 3247 len. 8]: I asked you that before , too .
Parsing [sent. 3248 len. 25]: But I always ask everybody what hotel they 're stopping at , and so I 've got my head all mixed up with hotels .
Parsing [sent. 3249 len. 11]: But it makes talk , and I love to talk .
Parsing [sent. 3250 len. 18]: It refreshes me up so -- do n't it you -- on a trip like this ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3251 len. 6]: `` Yes -- sometimes . ''
Parsing [sent. 3252 len. 9]: `` Well , it does me , too .
Parsing [sent. 3253 len. 20]: As long as I 'm talking I never feel bored -- ai n't that the way with you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3254 len. 5]: `` Yes -- generally .
Parsing [sent. 3255 len. 9]: But there are exception to the rule . ''
Parsing [sent. 3256 len. 6]: `` Oh , of course .
Parsing [sent. 3257 len. 11]: I do n't care to talk to everybody , MYSELF .
Parsing [sent. 3258 len. 30]: If a person starts in to jabber-jabber-jabber about scenery , and history , and pictures , and all sorts of tiresome things , I get the fan-tods mighty soon .
Parsing [sent. 3259 len. 26]: I say ` Well , I must be going now -- hope I 'll see you again ' -- and then I take a walk .
Parsing [sent. 3260 len. 5]: Where you from ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3261 len. 5]: `` New Jersey . ''
Parsing [sent. 3262 len. 15]: `` Why , bother it all , I asked you THAT before , too .
Parsing [sent. 3263 len. 9]: Have you seen the Lion of Lucerne ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3264 len. 5]: `` Not yet . ''
Parsing [sent. 3265 len. 6]: `` Nor I , either .
Parsing [sent. 3266 len. 19]: But the man who told me about Mount Pilatus says it 's one of the things to see .
Parsing [sent. 3267 len. 6]: It 's twenty-eight feet long .
Parsing [sent. 3268 len. 13]: It do n't seem reasonable , but he said so , anyway .
Parsing [sent. 3269 len. 22]: He saw it yesterday ; said it was dying , then , so I reckon it 's dead by this time .
Parsing [sent. 3270 len. 14]: But that ai n't any matter , of course they 'll stuff it .
Parsing [sent. 3271 len. 12]: Did you say the children are yours -- or HERS ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3272 len. 4]: `` Mine . ''
Parsing [sent. 3273 len. 7]: `` Oh , so you did .
Parsing [sent. 3274 len. 13]: Are you going up the ... no , I asked you that .
Parsing [sent. 3275 len. 12]: What ship ... no , I asked you that , too .
Parsing [sent. 3276 len. 12]: What hotel are you ... no , you told me that .
Parsing [sent. 3277 len. 24]: Let me see ... um ... Oh , what kind of voy ... no , we 've been over that ground , too .
Parsing [sent. 3278 len. 12]: Um ... um ... well , I believe that is all .
Parsing [sent. 3279 len. 14]: BONJOUR -- I am very glad to have made your acquaintance , ladies .
Parsing [sent. 3280 len. 4]: GUTEN TAG . ''
Parsing [sent. 3281 len. 55]: CHAPTER XXVIII -LSB- The Jodel and Its Native Wilds -RSB- The Rigi-Kulm is an imposing Alpine mass , six thousand feet high , which stands by itself , and commands a mighty prospect of blue lakes , green valleys , and snowy mountains -- a compact and magnificent picture three hundred miles in circumference .
Parsing [sent. 3282 len. 19]: The ascent is made by rail , or horseback , or on foot , as one may prefer .
Parsing [sent. 3283 len. 39]: I and my agent panoplied ourselves in walking-costume , one bright morning , and started down the lake on the steamboat ; we got ashore at the village of Waeggis ; three-quarters of an hour distant from Lucerne .
Parsing [sent. 3284 len. 10]: This village is at the foot of the mountain .
Parsing [sent. 3285 len. 21]: We were soon tramping leisurely up the leafy mule-path , and then the talk began to flow , as usual .
Parsing [sent. 3286 len. 48]: It was twelve o'clock noon , and a breezy , cloudless day ; the ascent was gradual , and the glimpses , from under the curtaining boughs , of blue water , and tiny sailboats , and beetling cliffs , were as charming as glimpses of dreamland .
Parsing [sent. 3287 len. 38]: All the circumstances were perfect -- and the anticipations , too , for we should soon be enjoying , for the first time , that wonderful spectacle , an Alpine sunrise -- the object of our journey .
Parsing [sent. 3288 len. 29]: There was -LRB- apparently -RRB- no real need for hurry , for the guide-book made the walking-distance from Waeggis to the summit only three hours and a quarter .
Parsing [sent. 3289 len. 38]: I say `` apparently , '' because the guide-book had already fooled us once -- about the distance from Allerheiligen to Oppenau -- and for aught I knew it might be getting ready to fool us again .
Parsing [sent. 3290 len. 28]: We were only certain as to the altitudes -- we calculated to find out for ourselves how many hours it is from the bottom to the top .
Parsing [sent. 3291 len. 19]: The summit is six thousand feet above the sea , but only forty-five hundred feet above the lake .
Parsing [sent. 3292 len. 58]: When we had walked half an hour , we were fairly into the swing and humor of the undertaking , so we cleared for action ; that is to say , we got a boy whom we met to carry our alpenstocks and satchels and overcoats and things for us ; that left us free for business .
Parsing [sent. 3293 len. 52]: I suppose we must have stopped oftener to stretch out on the grass in the shade and take a bit of a smoke than this boy was used to , for presently he asked if it had been our idea to hire him by the job , or by the year ?
Parsing [sent. 3294 len. 14]: We told him he could move along if he was in a hurry .
Parsing [sent. 3295 len. 25]: He said he was n't in such a very particular hurry , but he wanted to get to the top while he was young .
Parsing [sent. 3296 len. 25]: We told him to clear out , then , and leave the things at the uppermost hotel and say we should be along presently .
Parsing [sent. 3297 len. 40]: He said he would secure us a hotel if he could , but if they were all full he would ask them to build another one and hurry up and get the paint and plaster dry against we arrived .
Parsing [sent. 3298 len. 17]: Still gently chaffing us , he pushed ahead , up the trail , and soon disappeared .
Parsing [sent. 3299 len. 27]: By six o'clock we were pretty high up in the air , and the view of lake and mountains had greatly grown in breadth and interest .
Parsing [sent. 3300 len. 43]: We halted awhile at a little public house , where we had bread and cheese and a quart or two of fresh milk , out on the porch , with the big panorama all before us -- and then moved on again .
Parsing [sent. 3301 len. 43]: Ten minutes afterward we met a hot , red-faced man plunging down the mountain , making mighty strides , swinging his alpenstock ahead of him , and taking a grip on the ground with its iron point to support these big strides .
Parsing [sent. 3302 len. 35]: He stopped , fanned himself with his hat , swabbed the perspiration from his face and neck with a red handkerchief , panted a moment or two , and asked how far to Waeggis .
Parsing [sent. 3303 len. 5]: I said three hours .
Parsing [sent. 3304 len. 31]: He looked surprised , and said : `` Why , it seems as if I could toss a biscuit into the lake from here , it 's so close by .
Parsing [sent. 3305 len. 8]: Is that an inn , there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3306 len. 5]: I said it was .
Parsing [sent. 3307 len. 30]: `` Well , '' said he , `` I ca n't stand another three hours , I 've had enough today ; I 'll take a bed there . ''
Parsing [sent. 3308 len. 12]: I asked : `` Are we nearly to the top ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3309 len. 6]: `` Nearly to the TOP ?
Parsing [sent. 3310 len. 15]: Why , bless your soul , you have n't really started , yet . ''
Parsing [sent. 3311 len. 12]: I said we would put up at the inn , too .
Parsing [sent. 3312 len. 22]: So we turned back and ordered a hot supper , and had quite a jolly evening of it with this Englishman .
Parsing [sent. 3313 len. 39]: The German landlady gave us neat rooms and nice beds , and when I and my agent turned in , it was with the resolution to be up early and make the utmost of our first Alpine sunrise .
Parsing [sent. 3314 len. 38]: But of course we were dead tired , and slept like policemen ; so when we awoke in the morning and ran to the window it was already too late , because it was half past eleven .
Parsing [sent. 3315 len. 6]: It was a sharp disappointment .
Parsing [sent. 3316 len. 35]: However , we ordered breakfast and told the landlady to call the Englishman , but she said he was already up and off at daybreak -- and swearing like mad about something or other .
Parsing [sent. 3317 len. 10]: We could not find out what the matter was .
Parsing [sent. 3318 len. 27]: He had asked the landlady the altitude of her place above the level of the lake , and she told him fourteen hundred and ninety-five feet .
Parsing [sent. 3319 len. 13]: That was all that was said ; then he lost his temper .
Parsing [sent. 3320 len. 29]: He said that between ------ fools and guide-books , a man could acquire ignorance enough in twenty-four hours in a country like this to last him a year .
Parsing [sent. 3321 len. 29]: Harris believed our boy had been loading him up with misinformation ; and this was probably the case , for his epithet described that boy to a dot .
Parsing [sent. 3322 len. 25]: We got under way about the turn of noon , and pulled out for the summit again , with a fresh and vigorous step .
Parsing [sent. 3323 len. 44]: When we had gone about two hundred yards , and stopped to rest , I glanced to the left while I was lighting my pipe , and in the distance detected a long worm of black smoke crawling lazily up the steep mountain .
Parsing [sent. 3324 len. 7]: Of course that was the locomotive .
Parsing [sent. 3325 len. 22]: We propped ourselves on our elbows at once , to gaze , for we had never seen a mountain railway yet .
Parsing [sent. 3326 len. 8]: Presently we could make out the train .
Parsing [sent. 3327 len. 33]: It seemed incredible that that thing should creep straight up a sharp slant like the roof of a house -- but there it was , and it was doing that very miracle .
Parsing [sent. 3328 len. 38]: In the course of a couple hours we reached a fine breezy altitude where the little shepherd huts had big stones all over their roofs to hold them down to the earth when the great storms rage .
Parsing [sent. 3329 len. 23]: The country was wild and rocky about here , but there were plenty of trees , plenty of moss , and grass .
Parsing [sent. 3330 len. 42]: Away off on the opposite shore of the lake we could see some villages , and now for the first time we could observe the real difference between their proportions and those of the giant mountains at whose feet they slept .
Parsing [sent. 3331 len. 38]: When one is in one of those villages it seems spacious , and its houses seem high and not out of proportion to the mountain that overhangs them -- but from our altitude , what a change !
Parsing [sent. 3332 len. 84]: The mountains were bigger and grander than ever , as they stood there thinking their solemn thoughts with their heads in the drifting clouds , but the villages at their feet -- when the painstaking eye could trace them up and find them -- were so reduced , almost invisible , and lay so flat against the ground , that the exactest simile I can devise is to compare them to ant-deposits of granulated dirt overshadowed by the huge bulk of a cathedral .
Parsing [sent. 3333 len. 45]: The steamboats skimming along under the stupendous precipices were diminished by distance to the daintiest little toys , the sailboats and rowboats to shallops proper for fairies that keep house in the cups of lilies and ride to court on the backs of bumblebees .
Parsing [sent. 3334 len. 52]: Presently we came upon half a dozen sheep nibbling grass in the spray of a stream of clear water that sprang from a rock wall a hundred feet high , and all at once our ears were startled with a melodious `` Lul ... l ... l l l llul-lul-LAhee-o-o-o ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3335 len. 29]: pealing joyously from a near but invisible source , and recognized that we were hearing for the first time the famous Alpine JODEL in its own native wilds .
Parsing [sent. 3336 len. 28]: And we recognized , also , that it was that sort of quaint commingling of baritone and falsetto which at home we call `` Tyrolese warbling . ''
Parsing [sent. 3337 len. 22]: The jodeling -LRB- pronounced yOdling -- emphasis on the O -RRB- continued , and was very pleasant and inspiriting to hear .
Parsing [sent. 3338 len. 27]: Now the jodeler appeared -- a shepherd boy of sixteen -- and in our gladness and gratitude we gave him a franc to jodel some more .
Parsing [sent. 3339 len. 7]: So he jodeled and we listened .
Parsing [sent. 3340 len. 15]: We moved on , presently , and he generously jodeled us out of sight .
Parsing [sent. 3341 len. 25]: After about fifteen minutes we came across another shepherd boy who was jodeling , and gave him half a franc to keep it up .
Parsing [sent. 3342 len. 8]: He also jodeled us out of sight .
Parsing [sent. 3343 len. 72]: After that , we found a jodeler every ten minutes ; we gave the first one eight cents , the second one six cents , the third one four , the fourth one a penny , contributed nothing to Nos. 5 , 6 , and 7 , and during the remainder of the day hired the rest of the jodelers , at a franc apiece , not to jodel any more .
Parsing [sent. 3344 len. 12]: There is somewhat too much of the jodeling in the Alps .
Parsing [sent. 3345 len. 32]: About the middle of the afternoon we passed through a prodigious natural gateway called the Felsenthor , formed by two enormous upright rocks , with a third lying across the top .
Parsing [sent. 3346 len. 23]: There was a very attractive little hotel close by , but our energies were not conquered yet , so we went on .
Parsing [sent. 3347 len. 9]: Three hours afterward we came to the railway-track .
Parsing [sent. 3348 len. 41]: It was planted straight up the mountain with the slant of a ladder that leans against a house , and it seemed to us that man would need good nerves who proposed to travel up it or down it either .
Parsing [sent. 3349 len. 66]: During the latter part of the afternoon we cooled our roasting interiors with ice-cold water from clear streams , the only really satisfying water we had tasted since we left home , for at the hotels on the continent they merely give you a tumbler of ice to soak your water in , and that only modifies its hotness , does n't make it cold .
Parsing [sent. 3350 len. 21]: Water can only be made cold enough for summer comfort by being prepared in a refrigerator or a closed ice-pitcher .
Parsing [sent. 3351 len. 6]: Europeans say ice-water impairs digestion .
Parsing [sent. 3352 len. 5]: How do they know ?
Parsing [sent. 3353 len. 6]: -- they never drink any .
Parsing [sent. 3354 len. 31]: At ten minutes past six we reached the Kaltbad station , where there is a spacious hotel with great verandas which command a majestic expanse of lake and mountain scenery .
Parsing [sent. 3355 len. 36]: We were pretty well fagged out , now , but as we did not wish to miss the Alpine sunrise , we got through our dinner as quickly as possible and hurried off to bed .
Parsing [sent. 3356 len. 16]: It was unspeakably comfortable to stretch our weary limbs between the cool , damp sheets .
Parsing [sent. 3357 len. 6]: And how we did sleep !
Parsing [sent. 3358 len. 10]: -- for there is no opiate like Alpine pedestrianism .
Parsing [sent. 3359 len. 41]: In the morning we both awoke and leaped out of bed at the same instant and ran and stripped aside the window-curtains ; but we suffered a bitter disappointment again : it was already half past three in the afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 3360 len. 15]: We dressed sullenly and in ill spirits , each accusing the other of oversleeping .
Parsing [sent. 3361 len. 25]: Harris said if we had brought the courier along , as we ought to have done , we should not have missed these sunrises .
Parsing [sent. 3362 len. 49]: I said he knew very well that one of us would have to sit up and wake the courier ; and I added that we were having trouble enough to take care of ourselves , on this climb , without having to take care of a courier besides .
Parsing [sent. 3363 len. 61]: During breakfast our spirits came up a little , since we found by this guide-book that in the hotels on the summit the tourist is not left to trust to luck for his sunrise , but is roused betimes by a man who goes through the halls with a great Alpine horn , blowing blasts that would raise the dead .
Parsing [sent. 3364 len. 39]: And there was another consoling thing : the guide-book said that up there on the summit the guests did not wait to dress much , but seized a red bed blanket and sailed out arrayed like an Indian .
Parsing [sent. 3365 len. 47]: This was good ; this would be romantic ; two hundred and fifty people grouped on the windy summit , with their hair flying and their red blankets flapping , in the solemn presence of the coming sun , would be a striking and memorable spectacle .
Parsing [sent. 3366 len. 18]: So it was good luck , not ill luck , that we had missed those other sunrises .
Parsing [sent. 3367 len. 29]: We were informed by the guide-book that we were now 3,228 feet above the level of the lake -- therefore full two-thirds of our journey had been accomplished .
Parsing [sent. 3368 len. 45]: We got away at a quarter past four P.M. ; a hundred yards above the hotel the railway divided ; one track went straight up the steep hill , the other one turned square off to the right , with a very slight grade .
Parsing [sent. 3369 len. 28]: We took the latter , and followed it more than a mile , turned a rocky corner , and came in sight of a handsome new hotel .
Parsing [sent. 3370 len. 49]: If we had gone on , we should have arrived at the summit , but Harris preferred to ask a lot of questions -- as usual , of a man who did n't know anything -- and he told us to go back and follow the other route .
Parsing [sent. 3371 len. 4]: We did so .
Parsing [sent. 3372 len. 9]: We could ill afford this loss of time .
Parsing [sent. 3373 len. 26]: We climbed and climbed ; and we kept on climbing ; we reached about forty summits , but there was always another one just ahead .
Parsing [sent. 3374 len. 13]: It came on to rain , and it rained in dead earnest .
Parsing [sent. 3375 len. 10]: We were soaked through and it was bitter cold .
Parsing [sent. 3376 len. 24]: Next a smoky fog of clouds covered the whole region densely , and we took to the railway-ties to keep from getting lost .
Parsing [sent. 3377 len. 64]: Sometimes we slopped along in a narrow path on the left-hand side of the track , but by and by when the fog blew aside a little and we saw that we were treading the rampart of a precipice and that our left elbows were projecting over a perfectly boundless and bottomless vacancy , we gasped , and jumped for the ties again .
Parsing [sent. 3378 len. 11]: The night shut down , dark and drizzly and cold .
Parsing [sent. 3379 len. 25]: About eight in the evening the fog lifted and showed us a well-worn path which led up a very steep rise to the left .
Parsing [sent. 3380 len. 34]: We took it , and as soon as we had got far enough from the railway to render the finding it again an impossibility , the fog shut down on us once more .
Parsing [sent. 3381 len. 38]: We were in a bleak , unsheltered place , now , and had to trudge right along , in order to keep warm , though we rather expected to go over a precipice , sooner or later .
Parsing [sent. 3382 len. 17]: About nine o'clock we made an important discovery -- that we were not in any path .
Parsing [sent. 3383 len. 33]: We groped around a while on our hands and knees , but we could not find it ; so we sat down in the mud and the wet scant grass to wait .
Parsing [sent. 3384 len. 32]: We were terrified into this by being suddenly confronted with a vast body which showed itself vaguely for an instant and in the next instant was smothered in the fog again .
Parsing [sent. 3385 len. 36]: It was really the hotel we were after , monstrously magnified by the fog , but we took it for the face of a precipice , and decided not to try to claw up it .
Parsing [sent. 3386 len. 39]: We sat there an hour , with chattering teeth and quivering bodies , and quarreled over all sorts of trifles , but gave most of our attention to abusing each other for the stupidity of deserting the railway-track .
Parsing [sent. 3387 len. 20]: We sat with our backs to the precipice , because what little wind there was came from that quarter .
Parsing [sent. 3388 len. 56]: At some time or other the fog thinned a little ; we did not know when , for we were facing the empty universe and the thinness could not show ; but at last Harris happened to look around , and there stood a huge , dim , spectral hotel where the precipice had been .
Parsing [sent. 3389 len. 16]: One could faintly discern the windows and chimneys , and a dull blur of lights .
Parsing [sent. 3390 len. 41]: Our first emotion was deep , unutterable gratitude , our next was a foolish rage , born of the suspicion that possibly the hotel had been visible three-quarters of an hour while we sat there in those cold puddles quarreling .
Parsing [sent. 3391 len. 42]: Yes , it was the Rigi-Kulm hotel -- the one that occupies the extreme summit , and whose remote little sparkle of lights we had often seen glinting high aloft among the stars from our balcony away down yonder in Lucerne .
Parsing [sent. 3392 len. 51]: The crusty portier and the crusty clerks gave us the surly reception which their kind deal out in prosperous times , but by mollifying them with an extra display of obsequiousness and servility we finally got them to show us to the room which our boy had engaged for us .
Parsing [sent. 3393 len. 33]: We got into some dry clothing , and while our supper was preparing we loafed forsakenly through a couple of vast cavernous drawing-rooms , one of which had a stove in it .
Parsing [sent. 3394 len. 14]: This stove was in a corner , and densely walled around with people .
Parsing [sent. 3395 len. 44]: We could not get near the fire , so we moved at large in the artic spaces , among a multitude of people who sat silent , smileless , forlorn , and shivering -- thinking what fools they were to come , perhaps .
Parsing [sent. 3396 len. 19]: There were some Americans and some Germans , but one could see that the great majority were English .
Parsing [sent. 3397 len. 19]: We lounged into an apartment where there was a great crowd , to see what was going on .
Parsing [sent. 3398 len. 5]: It was a memento-magazine .
Parsing [sent. 3399 len. 47]: The tourists were eagerly buying all sorts and styles of paper-cutters , marked `` Souvenir of the Rigi , '' with handles made of the little curved horn of the ostensible chamois ; there were all manner of wooden goblets and such things , similarly marked .
Parsing [sent. 3400 len. 29]: I was going to buy a paper-cutter , but I believed I could remember the cold comfort of the Rigi-Kulm without it , so I smothered the impulse .
Parsing [sent. 3401 len. 52]: Supper warmed us , and we went immediately to bed -- but first , as Mr. Baedeker requests all tourists to call his attention to any errors which they may find in his guide-books , I dropped him a line to inform him he missed it by just about three days .
Parsing [sent. 3402 len. 36]: I had previously informed him of his mistake about the distance from Allerheiligen to Oppenau , and had also informed the Ordnance Depart of the German government of the same error in the imperial maps .
Parsing [sent. 3403 len. 48]: I will add , here , that I never got any answer to those letters , or any thanks from either of those sources ; and , what is still more discourteous , these corrections have not been made , either in the maps or the guide-books .
Parsing [sent. 3404 len. 17]: But I will write again when I get time , for my letters may have miscarried .
Parsing [sent. 3405 len. 15]: We curled up in the clammy beds , and went to sleep without rocking .
Parsing [sent. 3406 len. 24]: We were so sodden with fatigue that we never stirred nor turned over till the blooming blasts of the Alpine horn aroused us .
Parsing [sent. 3407 len. 13]: It may well be imagined that we did not lose any time .
Parsing [sent. 3408 len. 32]: We snatched on a few odds and ends of clothing , cocooned ourselves in the proper red blankets , and plunged along the halls and out into the whistling wind bareheaded .
Parsing [sent. 3409 len. 24]: We saw a tall wooden scaffolding on the very peak of the summit , a hundred yards away , and made for it .
Parsing [sent. 3410 len. 36]: We rushed up the stairs to the top of this scaffolding , and stood there , above the vast outlying world , with hair flying and ruddy blankets waving and cracking in the fierce breeze .
Parsing [sent. 3411 len. 10]: `` Fifteen minutes too late , at last ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3412 len. 8]: said Harris , in a vexed voice .
Parsing [sent. 3413 len. 10]: `` The sun is clear above the horizon . ''
Parsing [sent. 3414 len. 30]: `` No matter , '' I said , `` it is a most magnificent spectacle , and we will see it do the rest of its rising anyway . ''
Parsing [sent. 3415 len. 19]: In a moment we were deeply absorbed in the marvel before us , and dead to everything else .
Parsing [sent. 3416 len. 68]: The great cloud-barred disk of the sun stood just above a limitless expanse of tossing white-caps -- so to speak -- a billowy chaos of massy mountain domes and peaks draped in imperishable snow , and flooded with an opaline glory of changing and dissolving splendors , while through rifts in a black cloud-bank above the sun , radiating lances of diamond dust shot to the zenith .
Parsing [sent. 3417 len. 40]: The cloven valleys of the lower world swam in a tinted mist which veiled the ruggedness of their crags and ribs and ragged forests , and turned all the forbidding region into a soft and rich and sensuous paradise .
Parsing [sent. 3418 len. 5]: We could not speak .
Parsing [sent. 3419 len. 5]: We could hardly breathe .
Parsing [sent. 3420 len. 12]: We could only gaze in drunken ecstasy and drink in it .
Parsing [sent. 3421 len. 15]: Presently Harris exclaimed : `` Why -- nation , it 's going DOWN ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3422 len. 3]: Perfectly true .
Parsing [sent. 3423 len. 12]: We had missed the MORNING hornblow , and slept all day .
Parsing [sent. 3424 len. 4]: This was stupefying .
Parsing [sent. 3425 len. 78]: Harris said : `` Look here , the sun is n't the spectacle -- it 's US -- stacked up here on top of this gallows , in these idiotic blankets , and two hundred and fifty well-dressed men and women down here gawking up at us and not caring a straw whether the sun rises or sets , as long as they 've got such a ridiculous spectacle as this to set down in their memorandum-books .
Parsing [sent. 3426 len. 24]: They seem to be laughing their ribs loose , and there 's one girl there that appears to be going all to pieces .
Parsing [sent. 3427 len. 10]: I never saw such a man as you before .
Parsing [sent. 3428 len. 16]: I think you are the very last possibility in the way of an ass . ''
Parsing [sent. 3429 len. 7]: `` What have I done ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3430 len. 6]: I answered , with heat .
Parsing [sent. 3431 len. 6]: `` What have you done ?
Parsing [sent. 3432 len. 26]: You 've got up at half past seven o'clock in the evening to see the sun rise , that 's what you 've done . ''
Parsing [sent. 3433 len. 14]: `` And have you done any better , I 'd like to know ?
Parsing [sent. 3434 len. 24]: I 've always used to get up with the lark , till I came under the petrifying influence of your turgid intellect . ''
Parsing [sent. 3435 len. 27]: `` YOU used to get up with the lark -- Oh , no doubt -- you 'll get up with the hangman one of these days .
Parsing [sent. 3436 len. 28]: But you ought to be ashamed to be jawing here like this , in a red blanket , on a forty-foot scaffold on top of the Alps .
Parsing [sent. 3437 len. 22]: And no end of people down here to boot ; this is n't any place for an exhibition of temper . ''
Parsing [sent. 3438 len. 8]: And so the customary quarrel went on .
Parsing [sent. 3439 len. 24]: When the sun was fairly down , we slipped back to the hotel in the charitable gloaming , and went to bed again .
Parsing [sent. 3440 len. 64]: We had encountered the horn-blower on the way , and he had tried to collect compensation , not only for announcing the sunset , which we did see , but for the sunrise , which we had totally missed ; but we said no , we only took our solar rations on the `` European plan '' -- pay for what you get .
Parsing [sent. 3441 len. 17]: He promised to make us hear his horn in the morning , if we were alive .

Parsing [sent. 3505 len. 9]: We heard his horn and instantly got up .
Parsing [sent. 3506 len. 8]: It was dark and cold and wretched .
Parsing [sent. 3507 len. 44]: As I fumbled around for the matches , knocking things down with my quaking hands , I wished the sun would rise in the middle of the day , when it was warm and bright and cheerful , and one was n't sleepy .
Parsing [sent. 3508 len. 25]: We proceeded to dress by the gloom of a couple sickly candles , but we could hardly button anything , our hands shook so .
Parsing [sent. 3509 len. 67]: I thought of how many happy people there were in Europe , Asia , and America , and everywhere , who were sleeping peacefully in their beds , and did not have to get up and see the Rigi sunrise -- people who did not appreciate their advantage , as like as not , but would get up in the morning wanting more boons of Providence .
Parsing [sent. 3510 len. 52]: While thinking these thoughts I yawned , in a rather ample way , and my upper teeth got hitched on a nail over the door , and while I was mounting a chair to free myself , Harris drew the window-curtain , and said : `` Oh , this is luck !
Parsing [sent. 3511 len. 20]: We sha n't have to go out at all -- yonder are the mountains , in full view . ''
Parsing [sent. 3512 len. 7]: That was glad news , indeed .
Parsing [sent. 3513 len. 7]: It made us cheerful right away .
Parsing [sent. 3514 len. 27]: One could see the grand Alpine masses dimly outlined against the black firmament , and one or two faint stars blinking through rifts in the night .
Parsing [sent. 3515 len. 45]: Fully clothed , and wrapped in blankets , and huddled ourselves up , by the window , with lighted pipes , and fell into chat , while we waited in exceeding comfort to see how an Alpine sunrise was going to look by candlelight .
Parsing [sent. 3516 len. 32]: By and by a delicate , spiritual sort of effulgence spread itself by imperceptible degrees over the loftiest altitudes of the snowy wastes -- but there the effort seemed to stop .
Parsing [sent. 3517 len. 15]: I said , presently : `` There is a hitch about this sunrise somewhere .
Parsing [sent. 3518 len. 7]: It does n't seem to go .
Parsing [sent. 3519 len. 11]: What do you reckon is the matter with it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3520 len. 6]: `` I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 3521 len. 7]: It appears to hang fire somewhere .
Parsing [sent. 3522 len. 10]: I never saw a sunrise act like that before .
Parsing [sent. 3523 len. 13]: Can it be that the hotel is playing anything on us ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3524 len. 5]: `` Of course not .
Parsing [sent. 3525 len. 22]: The hotel merely has a property interest in the sun , it has nothing to do with the management of it .
Parsing [sent. 3526 len. 21]: It is a precarious kind of property , too ; a succession of total eclipses would probably ruin this tavern .
Parsing [sent. 3527 len. 11]: Now what can be the matter with this sunrise ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3528 len. 12]: Harris jumped up and said : `` I 've got it !
Parsing [sent. 3529 len. 9]: I know what 's the matter with it !
Parsing [sent. 3530 len. 15]: We 've been looking at the place where the sun SET last night ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3531 len. 6]: `` It is perfectly true !
Parsing [sent. 3532 len. 10]: Why could n't you have thought of that sooner ?
Parsing [sent. 3533 len. 7]: Now we 've lost another one !
Parsing [sent. 3534 len. 6]: And all through your blundering .
Parsing [sent. 3535 len. 24]: It was exactly like you to light a pipe and sit down to wait for the sun to rise in the west . ''
Parsing [sent. 3536 len. 14]: `` It was exactly like me to find out the mistake , too .
Parsing [sent. 3537 len. 8]: You never would have found it out .
Parsing [sent. 3538 len. 8]: I find out all the mistakes . ''
Parsing [sent. 3539 len. 19]: `` You make them all , too , else your most valuable faculty would be wasted on you .
Parsing [sent. 3540 len. 18]: But do n't stop to quarrel , now -- maybe we are not too late yet . ''
Parsing [sent. 3541 len. 4]: But we were .
Parsing [sent. 3542 len. 12]: The sun was well up when we got to the exhibition-ground .
Parsing [sent. 3543 len. 35]: On our way up we met the crowd returning -- men and women dressed in all sorts of queer costumes , and exhibiting all degrees of cold and wretchedness in their gaits and countenances .
Parsing [sent. 3544 len. 25]: A dozen still remained on the ground when we reached there , huddled together about the scaffold with their backs to the bitter wind .
Parsing [sent. 3545 len. 33]: They had their red guide-books open at the diagram of the view , and were painfully picking out the several mountains and trying to impress their names and positions on their memories .
Parsing [sent. 3546 len. 11]: It was one of the saddest sights I ever saw .
Parsing [sent. 3547 len. 20]: Two sides of this place were guarded by railings , to keep people from being blown over the precipices .
Parsing [sent. 3548 len. 29]: The view , looking sheer down into the broad valley , eastward , from this great elevation -- almost a perpendicular mile -- was very quaint and curious .
Parsing [sent. 3549 len. 74]: Counties , towns , hilly ribs and ridges , wide stretches of green meadow , great forest tracts , winding streams , a dozen blue lakes , a block of busy steamboats -- we saw all this little world in unique circumstantiality of detail -- saw it just as the birds see it -- and all reduced to the smallest of scales and as sharply worked out and finished as a steel engraving .
Parsing [sent. 3550 len. 165]: The numerous toy villages , with tiny spires projecting out of them , were just as the children might have left them when done with play the day before ; the forest tracts were diminished to cushions of moss ; one or two big lakes were dwarfed to ponds , the smaller ones to puddles -- though they did not look like puddles , but like blue teardrops which had fallen and lodged in slight depressions , conformable to their shapes , among the moss-beds and the smooth levels of dainty green farm-land ; the microscopic steamboats glided along , as in a city reservoir , taking a mighty time to cover the distance between ports which seemed only a yard apart ; and the isthmus which separated two lakes looked as if one might stretch out on it and lie with both elbows in the water , yet we knew invisible wagons were toiling across it and finding the distance a tedious one .
Parsing [sent. 3551 len. 48]: This beautiful miniature world had exactly the appearance of those `` relief maps '' which reproduce nature precisely , with the heights and depressions and other details graduated to a reduced scale , and with the rocks , trees , lakes , etc. , colored after nature .
Parsing [sent. 3552 len. 35]: I believed we could walk down to Waeggis or Vitznau in a day , but I knew we could go down by rail in about an hour , so I chose the latter method .
Parsing [sent. 3553 len. 11]: I wanted to see what it was like , anyway .
Parsing [sent. 3554 len. 18]: The train came along about the middle of the afternoon , and an odd thing it was .
Parsing [sent. 3555 len. 17]: The locomotive-boiler stood on end , and it and the whole locomotive were tilted sharply backward .
Parsing [sent. 3556 len. 13]: There were two passenger-cars , roofed , but wide open all around .
Parsing [sent. 3557 len. 26]: These cars were not tilted back , but the seats were ; this enables the passenger to sit level while going down a steep incline .
Parsing [sent. 3558 len. 42]: There are three railway-tracks ; the central one is cogged ; the `` lantern wheel '' of the engine grips its way along these cogs , and pulls the train up the hill or retards its motion on the down trip .
Parsing [sent. 3559 len. 15]: About the same speed -- three miles an hour -- is maintained both ways .
Parsing [sent. 3560 len. 18]: Whether going up or down , the locomotive is always at the lower end of the train .
Parsing [sent. 3561 len. 13]: It pushes in the one case , braces back in the other .
Parsing [sent. 3562 len. 13]: The passenger rides backward going up , and faces forward going down .
Parsing [sent. 3563 len. 38]: We got front seats , and while the train moved along about fifty yards on level ground , I was not the least frightened ; but now it started abruptly downstairs , and I caught my breath .
Parsing [sent. 3564 len. 33]: And I , like my neighbors , unconsciously held back all I could , and threw my weight to the rear , but , of course , that did no particular good .
Parsing [sent. 3565 len. 37]: I had slidden down the balusters when I was a boy , and thought nothing of it , but to slide down the balusters in a railway-train is a thing to make one 's flesh creep .
Parsing [sent. 3566 len. 52]: Sometimes we had as much as ten yards of almost level ground , and this gave us a few full breaths in comfort ; but straightway we would turn a corner and see a long steep line of rails stretching down below us , and the comfort was at an end .
Parsing [sent. 3567 len. 57]: One expected to see the locomotive pause , or slack up a little , and approach this plunge cautiously , but it did nothing of the kind ; it went calmly on , and went it reached the jumping-off place it made a sudden bow , and went gliding smoothly downstairs , untroubled by the circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 3568 len. 34]: It was wildly exhilarating to slide along the edge of the precipices , after this grisly fashion , and look straight down upon that far-off valley which I was describing a while ago .
Parsing [sent. 3569 len. 33]: There was no level ground at the Kaltbad station ; the railbed was as steep as a roof ; I was curious to see how the stop was going to be managed .
Parsing [sent. 3570 len. 60]: But it was very simple ; the train came sliding down , and when it reached the right spot it just stopped -- that was all there was `` to it '' -- stopped on the steep incline , and when the exchange of passengers and baggage had been made , it moved off and went sliding down again .
Parsing [sent. 3571 len. 13]: The train can be stopped anywhere , at a moment 's notice .
Parsing [sent. 3572 len. 61]: There was one curious effect , which I need not take the trouble to describe -- because I can scissor a description of it out of the railway company 's advertising pamphlet , and save my ink : `` On the whole tour , particularly at the Descent , we undergo an optical illusion which often seems to be incredible .
Parsing [sent. 3573 len. 30]: All the shrubs , fir trees , stables , houses , etc. , seem to be bent in a slanting direction , as by an immense pressure of air .
Parsing [sent. 3574 len. 23]: They are all standing awry , so much awry that the chalets and cottages of the peasants seem to be tumbling down .
Parsing [sent. 3575 len. 12]: It is the consequence of the steep inclination of the line .
Parsing [sent. 3576 len. 41]: Those who are seated in the carriage do not observe that they are going down a declivity of twenty to twenty-five degrees -LRB- their seats being adapted to this course of proceeding and being bent down at their backs -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 3577 len. 48]: They mistake their carriage and its horizontal lines for a proper measure of the normal plain , and therefore all the objects outside which really are in a horizontal position must show a disproportion of twenty to twenty-five degrees declivity , in regard to the mountain . ''
Parsing [sent. 3578 len. 29]: By the time one reaches Kaltbad , he has acquired confidence in the railway , and he now ceases to try to ease the locomotive by holding back .
Parsing [sent. 3579 len. 23]: Thenceforth he smokes his pipe in serenity , and gazes out upon the magnificent picture below and about him with unfettered enjoyment .
Parsing [sent. 3580 len. 21]: There is nothing to interrupt the view or the breeze ; it is like inspecting the world on the wing .
Parsing [sent. 3581 len. 51]: However -- to be exact -- there is one place where the serenity lapses for a while ; this is while one is crossing the Schnurrtobel Bridge , a frail structure which swings its gossamer frame down through the dizzy air , over a gorge , like a vagrant spider-strand .
Parsing [sent. 3582 len. 49]: One has no difficulty in remembering his sins while the train is creeping down this bridge ; and he repents of them , too ; though he sees , when he gets to Vitznau , that he need not have done it , the bridge was perfectly safe .
Parsing [sent. 3583 len. 17]: So ends the eventual trip which we made to the Rigi-Kulm to see an Alpine sunrise .
Parsing [sent. 3584 len. 19]: CHAPTER XXX -LSB- Harris Climbs Mountains for Me -RSB- An hour 's sail brought us to Lucerne again .
Parsing [sent. 3585 len. 35]: I judged it best to go to bed and rest several days , for I knew that the man who undertakes to make the tour of Europe on foot must take care of himself .
Parsing [sent. 3586 len. 33]: Thinking over my plans , as mapped out , I perceived that they did not take in the Furka Pass , the Rhone Glacier , the Finsteraarhorn , the Wetterhorn , etc. .
Parsing [sent. 3587 len. 32]: I immediately examined the guide-book to see if these were important , and found they were ; in fact , a pedestrian tour of Europe could not be complete without them .
Parsing [sent. 3588 len. 30]: Of course that decided me at once to see them , for I never allow myself to do things by halves , or in a slurring , slipshod way .
Parsing [sent. 3589 len. 42]: I called in my agent and instructed him to go without delay and make a careful examination of these noted places , on foot , and bring me back a written report of the result , for insertion in my book .
Parsing [sent. 3590 len. 43]: I instructed him to go to Hospenthal as quickly as possible , and make his grand start from there ; to extend his foot expedition as far as the Giesbach fall , and return to me from thence by diligence or mule .
Parsing [sent. 3591 len. 10]: I told him to take the courier with him .
Parsing [sent. 3592 len. 50]: He objected to the courier , and with some show of reason , since he was about to venture upon new and untried ground ; but I thought he might as well learn how to take care of the courier now as later , therefore I enforced my point .
Parsing [sent. 3593 len. 44]: I said that the trouble , delay , and inconvenience of traveling with a courier were balanced by the deep respect which a courier 's presence commands , and I must insist that as much style be thrown into my journeys as possible .
Parsing [sent. 3594 len. 10]: So the two assumed complete mountaineering costumes and departed .
Parsing [sent. 3595 len. 29]: A week later they returned , pretty well used up , and my agent handed me the following : Official Report OF A VISIT TO THE FURKA REGION .
Parsing [sent. 3596 len. 37]: BY H. HARRIS , AGENT About seven o'clock in the morning , with perfectly fine weather , we started from Hospenthal , and arrived at the MAISON on the Furka in a little under QUATRE hours .
Parsing [sent. 3597 len. 53]: The want of variety in the scenery from Hospenthal made the KAHKAHPONEEKA wearisome ; but let none be discouraged ; no one can fail to be completely R'ECOMPENS ` EE for his fatigue , when he sees , for the first time , the monarch of the Oberland , the tremendous Finsteraarhorn .
Parsing [sent. 3598 len. 49]: A moment before all was dullness , but a PAS further has placed us on the summit of the Furka ; and exactly in front of us , at a HOPOW of only fifteen miles , this magnificent mountain lifts its snow-wreathed precipices into the deep blue sky .
Parsing [sent. 3599 len. 67]: The inferior mountains on each side of the pass form a sort of frame for the picture of their dread lord , and close in the view so completely that no other prominent feature in the Oberland is visible from this BONG-A-BONG ; nothing withdraws the attention from the solitary grandeur of the Finsteraarhorn and the dependent spurs which form the abutments of the central peak .
Parsing [sent. 3600 len. 38]: With the addition of some others , who were also bound for the Grimsel , we formed a large XHVLOJ as we descended the STEG which winds round the shoulder of a mountain toward the Rhone Glacier .
Parsing [sent. 3601 len. 77]: We soon left the path and took to the ice ; and after wandering amongst the crevices UN PEU , to admire the wonders of these deep blue caverns , and hear the rushing of waters through their subglacial channels , we struck out a course toward L'AUTRE CÔTE and crossed the glacier successfully , a little above the cave from which the infant Rhone takes its first bound from under the grand precipice of ice .
Parsing [sent. 3602 len. 16]: Half a mile below this we began to climb the flowery side of the Meienwand .
Parsing [sent. 3603 len. 36]: One of our party started before the rest , but the HITZE was so great , that we found IHM quite exhausted , and lying at full length in the shade of a large GESTEIN .
Parsing [sent. 3604 len. 50]: We sat down with him for a time , for all felt the heat exceedingly in the climb up this very steep BOLWOGGOLY , and then we set out again together , and arrived at last near the Dead Man 's Lake , at the foot of the Sidelhorn .
Parsing [sent. 3605 len. 62]: This lonely spot , once used for an extempore burying-place , after a sanguinary BATTUE between the French and Austrians , is the perfection of desolation ; there is nothing in sight to mark the hand of man , except the line of weather-beaten whitened posts , set up to indicate the direction of the pass in the OWDAWAKK of winter .
Parsing [sent. 3606 len. 61]: Near this point the footpath joins the wider track , which connects the Grimsel with the head of the Rhone SCHNAWP ; this has been carefully constructed , and leads with a tortuous course among and over LES PIERRES , down to the bank of the gloomy little SWOSH-SWOSH , which almost washes against the walls of the Grimsel Hospice .
Parsing [sent. 3607 len. 41]: We arrived a little before four o'clock at the end of our day 's journey , hot enough to justify the step , taking by most of the PARTIE , of plunging into the crystal water of the snow-fed lake .
Parsing [sent. 3608 len. 46]: The next afternoon we started for a walk up the Unteraar glacier , with the intention of , at all events , getting as far as the Hütte which is used as a sleeping-place by most of those who cross the Strahleck Pass to Grindelwald .
Parsing [sent. 3609 len. 92]: We got over the tedious collection of stones and DÉBRIS which covers the PIED of the GLETCHER , and had walked nearly three hours from the Grimsel , when , just as we were thinking of crossing over to the right , to climb the cliffs at the foot of the hut , the clouds , which had for some time assumed a threatening appearance , suddenly dropped , and a huge mass of them , driving toward us from the Finsteraarhorn , poured down a deluge of HABOOLONG and hail .
Parsing [sent. 3610 len. 36]: Fortunately , we were not far from a very large glacier-table ; it was a huge rock balanced on a pedestal of ice high enough to admit of our all creeping under it for GOWKARAK .
Parsing [sent. 3611 len. 69]: A stream of PUCKITTYPUKK had furrowed a course for itself in the ice at its base , and we were obliged to stand with one FUSS on each side of this , and endeavor to keep ourselves CHAUD by cutting steps in the steep bank of the pedestal , so as to get a higher place for standing on , as the WASSER rose rapidly in its trench .
Parsing [sent. 3612 len. 81]: A very cold BZZZZZZZZEEE accompanied the storm , and made our position far from pleasant ; and presently came a flash of BLITZEN , apparently in the middle of our little party , with an instantaneous clap of YOKKY , sounding like a large gun fired close to our ears ; the effect was startling ; but in a few seconds our attention was fixed by the roaring echoes of the thunder against the tremendous mountains which completely surrounded us .
Parsing [sent. 3613 len. 63]: This was followed by many more bursts , none of WELCHE , however , was so dangerously near ; and after waiting a long DEMI-hour in our icy prison , we sallied out to talk through a HABOOLONG which , though not so heavy as before , was quite enough to give us a thorough soaking before our arrival at the Hospice .
Parsing [sent. 3614 len. 67]: The Grimsel is CERTAINEMENT a wonderful place ; situated at the bottom of a sort of huge crater , the sides of which are utterly savage GEBIRGE , composed of barren rocks which can not even support a single pine ARBRE , and afford only scanty food for a herd of GMWKWLLOLP , it looks as if it must be completely BEGRABEN in the winter snows .
Parsing [sent. 3615 len. 66]: Enormous avalanches fall against it every spring , sometimes covering everything to the depth of thirty or forty feet ; and , in spite of walls four feet thick , and furnished with outside shutters , the two men who stay here when the VOYAGEURS are snugly quartered in their distant homes can tell you that the snow sometimes shakes the house to its foundations .
Parsing [sent. 3616 len. 25]: Next morning the HOGGLEBUMGULLUP still continued bad , but we made up our minds to go on , and make the best of it .
Parsing [sent. 3617 len. 74]: Half an hour after we started , the REGEN thickened unpleasantly , and we attempted to get shelter under a projecting rock , but being far to NASS already to make standing at all AGRÉABLE , we pushed on for the Handeck , consoling ourselves with the reflection that from the furious rushing of the river Aar at our side , we should at all events see the celebrated WASSERFALL in GRANDE PERFECTION .
Parsing [sent. 3618 len. 112]: Nor were we NAPPERSOCKET in our expectation ; the water was roaring down its leap of two hundred and fifty feet in a most magnificent frenzy , while the trees which cling to its rocky sides swayed to and fro in the violence of the hurricane which it brought down with it ; even the stream , which falls into the main cascade at right angles , and TOUTEFOIS forms a beautiful feature in the scene , was now swollen into a raging torrent ; and the violence of this `` meeting of the waters , '' about fifty feet below the frail bridge where we stood , was fearfully grand .
Parsing [sent. 3619 len. 36]: While we were looking at it , GLÜECKLICHEWEISE a gleam of sunshine came out , and instantly a beautiful rainbow was formed by the spray , and hung in mid-air suspended over the awful gorge .
Parsing [sent. 3620 len. 70]: On going into the CHALET above the fall , we were informed that a BRUECKE had broken down near Guttanen , and that it would be impossible to proceed for some time ; accordingly we were kept in our drenched condition for EIN STUNDE , when some VOYAGEURS arrived from Meiringen , and told us that there had been a trifling accident , ABER that we could now cross .
Parsing [sent. 3621 len. 71]: On arriving at the spot , I was much inclined to suspect that the whole story was a ruse to make us SLOWWK and drink the more at the Handeck Inn , for only a few planks had been carried away , and though there might perhaps have been some difficulty with mules , the gap was certainly not larger than a MMBGLX might cross with a very slight leap .
Parsing [sent. 3622 len. 33]: Near Guttanen the HABOOLONG happily ceased , and we had time to walk ourselves tolerably dry before arriving at Reichenback , WO we enjoyed a good DINÉ at the Hotel des Alps .
Parsing [sent. 3623 len. 29]: Next morning we walked to Rosenlaui , the BEAU IDÉAL of Swiss scenery , where we spent the middle of the day in an excursion to the glacier .
Parsing [sent. 3624 len. 45]: This was more beautiful than words can describe , for in the constant progress of the ice it has changed the form of its extremity and formed a vast cavern , as blue as the sky above , and rippled like a frozen ocean .
Parsing [sent. 3625 len. 28]: A few steps cut in the WHOOPJAMBOREEHOO enabled us to walk completely under this , and feast our eyes upon one of the loveliest objects in creation .
Parsing [sent. 3626 len. 31]: The glacier was all around divided by numberless fissures of the same exquisite color , and the finest wood-ERDBEEREN were growing in abundance but a few yards from the ice .
Parsing [sent. 3627 len. 50]: The inn stands in a CHARMANT spot close to the CÔTÉ DE LA RIVIÈRE , which , lower down , forms the Reichenbach fall , and embosomed in the richest of pine woods , while the fine form of the Wellhorn looking down upon it completes the enchanting BOPPLE .
Parsing [sent. 3628 len. 53]: In the afternoon we walked over the Great Scheideck to Grindelwald , stopping to pay a visit to the Upper glacier by the way ; but we were again overtaken by bad HOGGLEBUMGULLUP and arrived at the hotel in a SOLCHE a state that the landlord 's wardrobe was in great request .
Parsing [sent. 3629 len. 30]: The clouds by this time seemed to have done their worst , for a lovely day succeeded , which we determined to devote to an ascent of the Faulhorn .
Parsing [sent. 3630 len. 46]: We left Grindelwald just as a thunder-storm was dying away , and we hoped to find GUTEN WETTER up above ; but the rain , which had nearly ceased , began again , and we were struck by the rapidly increasing FROID as we ascended .
Parsing [sent. 3631 len. 67]: Two-thirds of the way up were completed when the rain was exchanged for GNILLIC , with which the BODEN was thickly covered , and before we arrived at the top the GNILLIC and mist became so thick that we could not see one another at more than twenty POOPOO distance , and it became difficult to pick our way over the rough and thickly covered ground .
Parsing [sent. 3632 len. 85]: Shivering with cold , we turned into bed with a double allowance of clothes , and slept comfortably while the wind howled AUTOUR DE LA MAISON ; when I awoke , the wall and the window looked equally dark , but in another hour I found I could just see the form of the latter ; so I jumped out of bed , and forced it open , though with great difficulty from the frost and the quantities of GNILLIC heaped up against it .
Parsing [sent. 3633 len. 52]: A row of huge icicles hung down from the edge of the roof , and anything more wintry than the whole ANBLICK could not well be imagined ; but the sudden appearance of the great mountains in front was so startling that I felt no inclination to move toward bed again .
Parsing [sent. 3634 len. 43]: The snow which had collected upon LA FÊNTRE had increased the FINSTERNISS ODER DER DUNKELHEIT , so that when I looked out I was surprised to find that the daylight was considerable , and that the BALRAGOOMAH would evidently rise before long .
Parsing [sent. 3635 len. 48]: Only the brightest of LES E'TOILES were still shining ; the sky was cloudless overhead , though small curling mists lay thousands of feet below us in the valleys , wreathed around the feet of the mountains , and adding to the splendor of their lofty summits .
Parsing [sent. 3636 len. 43]: We were soon dressed and out of the house , watching the gradual approach of dawn , thoroughly absorbed in the first near view of the Oberland giants , which broke upon us unexpectedly after the intense obscurity of the evening before .
Parsing [sent. 3637 len. 8]: `` KABAUGWAKKO SONGWASHEE KUM WETTERHORN SNAWPO ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3638 len. 81]: cried some one , as that grand summit gleamed with the first rose of dawn ; and in a few moments the double crest of the Schreckhorn followed its example ; peak after peak seemed warmed with life , the Jungfrau blushed even more beautifully than her neighbors , and soon , from the Wetterhorn in the east to the Wildstrubel in the west , a long row of fires glowed upon mighty altars , truly worthy of the gods .
Parsing [sent. 3639 len. 54]: The WLGW was very severe ; our sleeping-place could hardly be DISTINGUEÉ from the snow around it , which had fallen to a depth of a FLIRK during the past evening , and we heartily enjoyed a rough scramble EN BAS to the Giesbach falls , where we soon found a warm climate .
Parsing [sent. 3640 len. 19]: At noon the day before Grindelwald the thermometer could not have stood at less than 100 degrees Fahr .
Parsing [sent. 3641 len. 45]: in the sun ; and in the evening , judging from the icicles formed , and the state of the windows , there must have been at least twelve DINGBLATTER of frost , thus giving a change of 80 degrees during a few hours .
Parsing [sent. 3642 len. 54]: I said : `` You have done well , Harris ; this report is concise , compact , well expressed ; the language is crisp , the descriptions are vivid and not needlessly elaborated ; your report goes straight to the point , attends strictly to business , and does n't fool around .
Parsing [sent. 3643 len. 9]: It is in many ways an excellent document .
Parsing [sent. 3644 len. 17]: But it has a fault -- it is too learned , it is much too learned .
Parsing [sent. 3645 len. 7]: What is ` DINGBLATTER ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3646 len. 13]: ` DINGBLATTER ' is a Fiji word meaning ` degrees . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 3647 len. 11]: `` You knew the English of it , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3648 len. 6]: `` Oh , yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 3649 len. 7]: `` What is ` GNILLIC ' ?
Parsing [sent. 3650 len. 12]: `` That is the Eskimo term for ` snow . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 3651 len. 12]: `` So you knew the English for that , too ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3652 len. 6]: `` Why , certainly . ''
Parsing [sent. 3653 len. 10]: `` What does ` MMBGLX ' stand for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3654 len. 11]: `` That is Zulu for ` pedestrian . ' '' ''
Parsing [sent. 3655 len. 17]: ` While the form of the Wellhorn looking down upon it completes the enchanting BOPPLE . '
Parsing [sent. 3656 len. 8]: What is ` BOPPLE ' ? '' ''
Parsing [sent. 3657 len. 4]: ` Picture . '
Parsing [sent. 3658 len. 5]: It 's Choctaw . ''
Parsing [sent. 3659 len. 9]: `` What is ` SCHNAWP ' ? '' ''
Parsing [sent. 3660 len. 4]: ` Valley . '
Parsing [sent. 3661 len. 7]: That is Choctaw , also . ''
Parsing [sent. 3662 len. 8]: `` What is ` BOLWOGGOLY ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3663 len. 11]: `` That is Chinese for ` hill . ' '' ''
Parsing [sent. 3664 len. 6]: ` KAHKAHPONEEKA ' ? '' ''
Parsing [sent. 3665 len. 4]: ` Ascent . '
Parsing [sent. 3666 len. 4]: Choctaw . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 3667 len. 11]: ` But we were again overtaken by bad HOGGLEBUMGULLUP . '
Parsing [sent. 3668 len. 8]: What does ` HOGGLEBUMGULLUP ' mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3669 len. 10]: `` That is Chinese for ` weather . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 3670 len. 11]: `` Is ` HOGGLEBUMGULLUP ' better than the English word ?
Parsing [sent. 3671 len. 7]: Is it any more descriptive ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3672 len. 10]: `` No , it means just the same . ''
Parsing [sent. 3673 len. 29]: `` And ` DINGBLATTER ' and ` GNILLIC , ' and ` BOPPLE , ' and ` SCHNAWP ' -- are they better than the English words ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3674 len. 13]: `` No , they mean just what the English ones do . ''
Parsing [sent. 3675 len. 8]: `` Then why do you use them ?
Parsing [sent. 3676 len. 14]: Why have you used all this Chinese and Choctaw and Zulu rubbish ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3677 len. 27]: `` Because I did n't know any French but two or three words , and I did n't know any Latin or Greek at all . ''
Parsing [sent. 3678 len. 5]: `` That is nothing .
Parsing [sent. 3679 len. 12]: Why should you want to use foreign words , anyhow ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3680 len. 6]: `` They adorn my page .
Parsing [sent. 3681 len. 6]: They all do it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3682 len. 8]: `` Who is ` all ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3683 len. 3]: `` Everybody .
Parsing [sent. 3684 len. 5]: Everybody that writes elegantly .
Parsing [sent. 3685 len. 10]: Anybody has a right to that wants to . ''
Parsing [sent. 3686 len. 8]: `` I think you are mistaken . ''
Parsing [sent. 3687 len. 9]: I then proceeded in the following scathing manner .
Parsing [sent. 3688 len. 58]: `` When really learned men write books for other learned men to read , they are justified in using as many learned words as they please -- their audience will understand them ; but a man who writes a book for the general public to read is not justified in disfiguring his pages with untranslated foreign expressions .
Parsing [sent. 3689 len. 45]: It is an insolence toward the majority of the purchasers , for it is a very frank and impudent way of saying , ` Get the translations made yourself if you want them , this book is not written for the ignorant classes . '
Parsing [sent. 3690 len. 49]: There are men who know a foreign language so well and have used it so long in their daily life that they seem to discharge whole volleys of it into their English writings unconsciously , and so they omit to translate , as much as half the time .
Parsing [sent. 3691 len. 16]: That is a great cruelty to nine out of ten of the man 's readers .
Parsing [sent. 3692 len. 7]: What is the excuse for this ?
Parsing [sent. 3693 len. 23]: The writer would say he only uses the foreign language where the delicacy of his point can not be conveyed in English .
Parsing [sent. 3694 len. 28]: Very well , then he writes his best things for the tenth man , and he ought to warn the nine other not to buy his book .
Parsing [sent. 3695 len. 76]: However , the excuse he offers is at least an excuse ; but there is another set of men who are like YOU ; they know a WORD here and there , of a foreign language , or a few beggarly little three-word phrases , filched from the back of the Dictionary , and these are continually peppering into their literature , with a pretense of knowing that language -- what excuse can they offer ?
Parsing [sent. 3696 len. 75]: The foreign words and phrases which they use have their exact equivalents in a nobler language -- English ; yet they think they ` adorn their page ' when they say STRASSE for street , and BAHNHOF for railway-station , and so on -- flaunting these fluttering rags of poverty in the reader 's face and imagining he will be ass enough to take them for the sign of untold riches held in reserve .
Parsing [sent. 3697 len. 65]: I will let your ` learning ' remain in your report ; you have as much right , I suppose , to ` adorn your page ' with Zulu and Chinese and Choctaw rubbish as others of your sort have to adorn theirs with insolent odds and ends smouched from half a dozen learned tongues whose A-B ABS they do n't even know . ''
Parsing [sent. 3698 len. 22]: When the musing spider steps upon the red-hot shovel , he first exhibits a wild surprise , then he shrivels up .
Parsing [sent. 3699 len. 15]: Similar was the effect of these blistering words upon the tranquil and unsuspecting Agent .
Parsing [sent. 3700 len. 14]: I can be dreadfully rough on a person when the mood takes me .
Parsing [sent. 3701 len. 25]: CHAPTER XXXI -LSB- Alp-scaling by Carriage -RSB- We now prepared for a considerable walk -- from Lucerne to Interlaken , over the Bruenig Pass .
Parsing [sent. 3702 len. 21]: But at the last moment the weather was so good that I changed my mind and hired a four-horse carriage .
Parsing [sent. 3703 len. 21]: It was a huge vehicle , roomy , as easy in its motion as a palanquin , and exceedingly comfortable .
Parsing [sent. 3704 len. 60]: We got away pretty early in the morning , after a hot breakfast , and went bowling over a hard , smooth road , through the summer loveliness of Switzerland , with near and distant lakes and mountains before and about us for the entertainment of the eye , and the music of multitudinous birds to charm the ear .
Parsing [sent. 3705 len. 78]: Sometimes there was only the width of the road between the imposing precipices on the right and the clear cool water on the left with its shoals of uncatchable fish skimming about through the bars of sun and shadow ; and sometimes , in place of the precipices , the grassy land stretched away , in an apparently endless upward slant , and was dotted everywhere with snug little chalets , the peculiarly captivating cottage of Switzerland .
Parsing [sent. 3706 len. 36]: The ordinary chalet turns a broad , honest gable end to the road , and its ample roof hovers over the home in a protecting , caressing way , projecting its sheltering eaves far outward .
Parsing [sent. 3707 len. 24]: The quaint windows are filled with little panes , and garnished with white muslin curtains , and brightened with boxes of blooming flowers .
Parsing [sent. 3708 len. 42]: Across the front of the house , and up the spreading eaves and along the fanciful railings of the shallow porch , are elaborate carvings -- wreaths , fruits , arabesques , verses from Scripture , names , dates , etc. .
Parsing [sent. 3709 len. 17]: The building is wholly of wood , reddish brown in tint , a very pleasing color .
Parsing [sent. 3710 len. 8]: It generally has vines climbing over it .
Parsing [sent. 3711 len. 33]: Set such a house against the fresh green of the hillside , and it looks ever so cozy and inviting and picturesque , and is a decidedly graceful addition to the landscape .
Parsing [sent. 3712 len. 114]: One does not find out what a hold the chalet has taken upon him , until he presently comes upon a new house -- a house which is aping the town fashions of Germany and France , a prim , hideous , straight-up-and-down thing , plastered all over on the outside to look like stone , and altogether so stiff , and formal , and ugly , and forbidding , and so out of tune with the gracious landscape , and so deaf and dumb and dead to the poetry of its surroundings , that it suggests an undertaker at a picnic , a corpse at a wedding , a puritan in Paradise .
Parsing [sent. 3713 len. 23]: In the course of the morning we passed the spot where Pontius Pilate is said to have thrown himself into the lake .
Parsing [sent. 3714 len. 35]: The legend goes that after the Crucifixion his conscience troubled him , and he fled from Jerusalem and wandered about the earth , weary of life and a prey to tortures of the mind .
Parsing [sent. 3715 len. 47]: Eventually , he hid himself away , on the heights of Mount Pilatus , and dwelt alone among the clouds and crags for years ; but rest and peace were still denied him , so he finally put an end to his misery by drowning himself .
Parsing [sent. 3716 len. 14]: Presently we passed the place where a man of better odor was born .
Parsing [sent. 3717 len. 14]: This was the children 's friend , Santa Claus , or St. Nicholas .
Parsing [sent. 3718 len. 9]: There are some unaccountable reputations in the world .
Parsing [sent. 3719 len. 7]: This saint 's is an instance .
Parsing [sent. 3720 len. 26]: He has ranked for ages as the peculiar friend of children , yet it appears he was not much of a friend to his own .
Parsing [sent. 3721 len. 56]: He had ten of them , and when fifty years old he left them , and sought out as dismal a refuge from the world as possible , and became a hermit in order that he might reflect upon pious themes without being disturbed by the joyous and other noises from the nursery , doubtless .
Parsing [sent. 3722 len. 27]: Judging by Pilate and St. Nicholas , there exists no rule for the construction of hermits ; they seem made out of all kinds of material .
Parsing [sent. 3723 len. 51]: But Pilate attended to the matter of expiating his sin while he was alive , whereas St. Nicholas will probably have to go on climbing down sooty chimneys , Christmas eve , forever , and conferring kindness on other people 's children , to make up for deserting his own .
Parsing [sent. 3724 len. 25]: His bones are kept in a church in a village -LRB- Sachseln -RRB- which we visited , and are naturally held in great reverence .
Parsing [sent. 3725 len. 23]: His portrait is common in the farmhouses of the region , but is believed by many to be but an indifferent likeness .
Parsing [sent. 3726 len. 33]: During his hermit life , according to legend , he partook of the bread and wine of the communion once a month , but all the rest of the month he fasted .
Parsing [sent. 3727 len. 37]: A constant marvel with us , as we sped along the bases of the steep mountains on this journey , was , not that avalanches occur , but that they are not occurring all the time .
Parsing [sent. 3728 len. 16]: One does not understand why rocks and landslides do not plunge down these declivities daily .
Parsing [sent. 3729 len. 24]: A landslip occurred three quarters of a century ago , on the route from Arth to Brunnen , which was a formidable thing .
Parsing [sent. 3730 len. 49]: A mass of conglomerate two miles long , a thousand feet broad , and a hundred feet thick , broke away from a cliff three thousand feet high and hurled itself into the valley below , burying four villages and five hundred people , as in a grave .
Parsing [sent. 3731 len. 103]: We had such a beautiful day , and such endless pictures of limpid lakes , and green hills and valleys , and majestic mountains , and milky cataracts dancing down the steeps and gleaming in the sun , that we could not help feeling sweet toward all the world ; so we tried to drink all the milk , and eat all the grapes and apricots and berries , and buy all the bouquets of wild flowers which the little peasant boys and girls offered for sale ; but we had to retire from this contract , for it was too heavy .
Parsing [sent. 3732 len. 76]: At short distances -- and they were entirely too short -- all along the road , were groups of neat and comely children , with their wares nicely and temptingly set forth in the grass under the shade trees , and as soon as we approached they swarmed into the road , holding out their baskets and milk bottles , and ran beside the carriage , barefoot and bareheaded , and importuned us to buy .
Parsing [sent. 3733 len. 27]: They seldom desisted early , but continued to run and insist -- beside the wagon while they could , and behind it until they lost breath .
Parsing [sent. 3734 len. 14]: Then they turned and chased a returning carriage back to their trading-post again .
Parsing [sent. 3735 len. 15]: After several hours of this , without any intermission , it becomes almost annoying .
Parsing [sent. 3736 len. 19]: I do not know what we should have done without the returning carriages to draw off the pursuit .
Parsing [sent. 3737 len. 18]: However , there were plenty of these , loaded with dusty tourists and piled high with luggage .
Parsing [sent. 3738 len. 25]: Indeed , from Lucerne to Interlaken we had the spectacle , among other scenery , of an unbroken procession of fruit-peddlers and tourists carriages .
Parsing [sent. 3739 len. 28]: Our talk was mostly anticipatory of what we should see on the down-grade of the Bruenig , by and by , after we should pass the summit .
Parsing [sent. 3740 len. 132]: All our friends in Lucerne had said that to look down upon Meiringen , and the rushing blue-gray river Aar , and the broad level green valley ; and across at the mighty Alpine precipices that rise straight up to the clouds out of that valley ; and up at the microscopic chalets perched upon the dizzy eaves of those precipices and winking dimly and fitfully through the drifting veil of vapor ; and still up and up , at the superb Oltschiback and the other beautiful cascades that leap from those rugged heights , robed in powdery spray , ruffled with foam , and girdled with rainbows -- to look upon these things , they say , was to look upon the last possibility of the sublime and the enchanting .
Parsing [sent. 3741 len. 57]: Therefore , as I say , we talked mainly of these coming wonders ; if we were conscious of any impatience , it was to get there in favorable season ; if we felt any anxiety , it was that the day might remain perfect , and enable us to see those marvels at their best .
Parsing [sent. 3742 len. 14]: As we approached the Kaiserstuhl , a part of the harness gave way .
Parsing [sent. 3743 len. 13]: We were in distress for a moment , but only a moment .
Parsing [sent. 3744 len. 33]: It was the fore-and-aft gear that was broken -- the thing that leads aft from the forward part of the horse and is made fast to the thing that pulls the wagon .
Parsing [sent. 3745 len. 38]: In America this would have been a heavy leathern strap ; but , all over the continent it is nothing but a piece of rope the size of your little finger -- clothes-line is what it is .
Parsing [sent. 3746 len. 18]: Cabs use it , private carriages , freight-carts and wagons , all sorts of vehicles have it .
Parsing [sent. 3747 len. 65]: In Munich I afterward saw it used on a long wagon laden with fifty-four half-barrels of beer ; I had before noticed that the cabs in Heidelberg used it -- not new rope , but rope that had been in use since Abraham 's time -- and I had felt nervous , sometimes , behind it when the cab was tearing down a hill .
Parsing [sent. 3748 len. 25]: But I had long been accustomed to it now , and had even become afraid of the leather strap which belonged in its place .
Parsing [sent. 3749 len. 20]: Our driver got a fresh piece of clothes-line out of his locker and repaired the break in two minutes .
Parsing [sent. 3750 len. 7]: So much for one European fashion .
Parsing [sent. 3751 len. 7]: Every country has its own ways .
Parsing [sent. 3752 len. 18]: It may interest the reader to know how they `` put horses to '' on the continent .
Parsing [sent. 3753 len. 239]: The man stands up the horses on each side of the thing that projects from the front end of the wagon , and then throws the tangled mess of gear forward through a ring , and hauls it aft , and passes the other thing through the other ring and hauls it aft on the other side of the other horse , opposite to the first one , after crossing them and bringing the loose end back , and then buckles the other thing underneath the horse , and takes another thing and wraps it around the thing I spoke of before , and puts another thing over each horse 's head , with broad flappers to it to keep the dust out of his eyes , and puts the iron thing in his mouth for him to grit his teeth on , uphill , and brings the ends of these things aft over his back , after buckling another one around under his neck to hold his head up , and hitching another thing on a thing that goes over his shoulders to keep his head up when he is climbing a hill , and then takes the slack of the thing which I mentioned a while ago , and fetches it aft and makes it fast to the thing that pulls the wagon , and hands the other things up to the driver to steer with .
Parsing [sent. 3754 len. 20]: I never have buckled up a horse myself , but I do not think we do it that way .
Parsing [sent. 3755 len. 17]: We had four very handsome horses , and the driver was very proud of his turnout .
Parsing [sent. 3756 len. 43]: He would bowl along on a reasonable trot , on the highway , but when he entered a village he did it on a furious run , and accompanied it with a frenzy of ceaseless whip-crackings that sounded like volleys of musketry .
Parsing [sent. 3757 len. 99]: He tore through the narrow streets and around the sharp curves like a moving earthquake , showering his volleys as he went , and before him swept a continuous tidal wave of scampering children , ducks , cats , and mothers clasping babies which they had snatched out of the way of the coming destruction ; and as this living wave washed aside , along the walls , its elements , being safe , forgot their fears and turned their admiring gaze upon that gallant driver till he thundered around the next curve and was lost to sight .
Parsing [sent. 3758 len. 18]: He was a great man to those villagers , with his gaudy clothes and his terrific ways .
Parsing [sent. 3759 len. 56]: Whenever he stopped to have his cattle watered and fed with loaves of bread , the villagers stood around admiring him while he swaggered about , the little boys gazed up at his face with humble homage , and the landlord brought out foaming mugs of beer and conversed proudly with him while he drank .
Parsing [sent. 3760 len. 22]: Then he mounted his lofty box , swung his explosive whip , and away he went again , like a storm .
Parsing [sent. 3761 len. 31]: I had not seen anything like this before since I was a boy , and the stage used to flourish the village with the dust flying and the horn tooting .
Parsing [sent. 3762 len. 66]: When we reached the base of the Kaiserstuhl , we took two more horses ; we had to toil along with difficulty for an hour and a half or two hours , for the ascent was not very gradual , but when we passed the backbone and approached the station , the driver surpassed all his previous efforts in the way of rush and clatter .
Parsing [sent. 3763 len. 23]: He could not have six horses all the time , so he made the most of his chance while he had it .
Parsing [sent. 3764 len. 16]: Up to this point we had been in the heart of the William Tell region .
Parsing [sent. 3765 len. 16]: The hero is not forgotten , by any means , or held in doubtful veneration .
Parsing [sent. 3766 len. 23]: His wooden image , with his bow drawn , above the doors of taverns , was a frequent feature of the scenery .
Parsing [sent. 3767 len. 54]: About noon we arrived at the foot of the Bruenig Pass , and made a two-hour stop at the village hotel , another of those clean , pretty , and thoroughly well-kept inns which are such an astonishment to people who are accustomed to hotels of a dismally different pattern in remote country-towns .
Parsing [sent. 3768 len. 51]: There was a lake here , in the lap of the great mountains , the green slopes that rose toward the lower crags were graced with scattered Swiss cottages nestling among miniature farms and gardens , and from out a leafy ambuscade in the upper heights tumbled a brawling cataract .
Parsing [sent. 3769 len. 20]: Carriage after carriage , laden with tourists and trunks , arrived , and the quiet hotel was soon populous .
Parsing [sent. 3770 len. 15]: We were early at the table d'hôte and saw the people all come in .
Parsing [sent. 3771 len. 6]: There were twenty-five , perhaps .
Parsing [sent. 3772 len. 13]: They were of various nationalities , but we were the only Americans .
Parsing [sent. 3773 len. 40]: Next to me sat an English bride , and next to her sat her new husband , whom she called `` Neddy , '' though he was big enough and stalwart enough to be entitled to his full name .
Parsing [sent. 3774 len. 15]: They had a pretty little lovers ' quarrel over what wine they should have .
Parsing [sent. 3775 len. 27]: Neddy was for obeying the guide-book and taking the wine of the country ; but the bride said : `` What , that nahsty stuff ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3776 len. 14]: `` It is n't nahsty , pet , it 's quite good . ''
Parsing [sent. 3777 len. 6]: `` It IS nahsty . ''
Parsing [sent. 3778 len. 9]: `` No , it IS N'T nahsty . ''
Parsing [sent. 3779 len. 16]: `` It 's Oful nahsty , Neddy , and I shah n't drink it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3780 len. 10]: Then the question was , what she must have .
Parsing [sent. 3781 len. 14]: She said he knew very well that she never drank anything but champagne .
Parsing [sent. 3782 len. 26]: She added : `` You know very well papa always has champagne on his table , and I 've always been used to it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3783 len. 51]: Neddy made a playful pretense of being distressed about the expense , and this amused her so much that she nearly exhausted herself with laughter -- and this pleased HIM so much that he repeated his jest a couple of times , and added new and killing varieties to it .
Parsing [sent. 3784 len. 50]: When the bride finally recovered , she gave Neddy a love-box on the arm with her fan , and said with arch severity : `` Well , you would HAVE me -- nothing else would do -- so you 'll have to make the best of a bad bargain .
Parsing [sent. 3785 len. 11]: DO order the champagne , I 'm Oful dry . ''
Parsing [sent. 3786 len. 16]: So with a mock groan which made her laugh again , Neddy ordered the champagne .
Parsing [sent. 3787 len. 32]: The fact that this young woman had never moistened the selvedge edge of her soul with a less plebeian tipple than champagne , had a marked and subduing effect on Harris .
Parsing [sent. 3788 len. 9]: He believed she belonged to the royal family .
Parsing [sent. 3789 len. 6]: But I had my doubts .
Parsing [sent. 3790 len. 60]: We heard two or three different languages spoken by people at the table and guessed out the nationalities of most of the guests to our satisfaction , but we failed with an elderly gentleman and his wife and a young girl who sat opposite us , and with a gentleman of about thirty-five who sat three seats beyond Harris .
Parsing [sent. 3791 len. 9]: We did not hear any of these speak .
Parsing [sent. 3792 len. 26]: But finally the last-named gentleman left while we were not noticing , but we looked up as he reached the far end of the table .
Parsing [sent. 3793 len. 15]: He stopped there a moment , and made his toilet with a pocket comb .
Parsing [sent. 3794 len. 21]: So he was a German ; or else he had lived in German hotels long enough to catch the fashion .
Parsing [sent. 3795 len. 18]: When the elderly couple and the young girl rose to leave , they bowed respectfully to us .
Parsing [sent. 3796 len. 7]: So they were Germans , too .
Parsing [sent. 3797 len. 14]: This national custom is worth six of the other one , for export .
Parsing [sent. 3798 len. 34]: After dinner we talked with several Englishmen , and they inflamed our desire to a hotter degree than ever , to see the sights of Meiringen from the heights of the Bruenig Pass .
Parsing [sent. 3799 len. 20]: They said the view was marvelous , and that one who had seen it once could never forget it .
Parsing [sent. 3800 len. 103]: They also spoke of the romantic nature of the road over the pass , and how in one place it had been cut through a flank of the solid rock , in such a way that the mountain overhung the tourist as he passed by ; and they furthermore said that the sharp turns in the road and the abruptness of the descent would afford us a thrilling experience , for we should go down in a flying gallop and seem to be spinning around the rings of a whirlwind , like a drop of whiskey descending the spirals of a corkscrew .
Parsing [sent. 3801 len. 46]: I got all the information out of these gentlemen that we could need ; and then , to make everything complete , I asked them if a body could get hold of a little fruit and milk here and there , in case of necessity .
Parsing [sent. 3802 len. 17]: They threw up their hands in speechless intimation that the road was simply paved with refreshment-peddlers .
Parsing [sent. 3803 len. 19]: We were impatient to get away , now , and the rest of our two-hour stop rather dragged .
Parsing [sent. 3804 len. 12]: But finally the set time arrived and we began the ascent .
Parsing [sent. 3805 len. 7]: Indeed it was a wonderful road .
Parsing [sent. 3806 len. 35]: It was smooth , and compact , and clean , and the side next the precipices was guarded all along by dressed stone posts about three feet high , placed at short distances apart .
Parsing [sent. 3807 len. 16]: The road could not have been better built if Napoleon the First had built it .
Parsing [sent. 3808 len. 17]: He seems to have been the introducer of the sort of roads which Europe now uses .
Parsing [sent. 3809 len. 68]: All literature which describes life as it existed in England , France , and Germany up to the close of the last century , is filled with pictures of coaches and carriages wallowing through these three countries in mud and slush half-wheel deep ; but after Napoleon had floundered through a conquered kingdom he generally arranged things so that the rest of the world could follow dry-shod .
Parsing [sent. 3810 len. 102]: We went on climbing , higher and higher , and curving hither and thither , in the shade of noble woods , and with a rich variety and profusion of wild flowers all about us ; and glimpses of rounded grassy backbones below us occupied by trim chalets and nibbling sheep , and other glimpses of far lower altitudes , where distance diminished the chalets to toys and obliterated the sheep altogether ; and every now and then some ermined monarch of the Alps swung magnificently into view for a moment , then drifted past an intervening spur and disappeared again .
Parsing [sent. 3811 len. 46]: It was an intoxicating trip altogether ; the exceeding sense of satisfaction that follows a good dinner added largely to the enjoyment ; the having something especial to look forward to and muse about , like the approaching grandeurs of Meiringen , sharpened the zest .
Parsing [sent. 3812 len. 28]: Smoking was never so good before , solid comfort was never solider ; we lay back against the thick cushions silent , meditative , steeped in felicity .
Parsing [sent. 3813 len. 19]: * * * * * * * * I rubbed my eyes , opened them , and started .
Parsing [sent. 3814 len. 25]: I had been dreaming I was at sea , and it was a thrilling surprise to wake up and find land all around me .
Parsing [sent. 3815 len. 24]: It took me a couple seconds to `` come to , '' as you may say ; then I took in the situation .
Parsing [sent. 3816 len. 78]: The horses were drinking at a trough in the edge of a town , the driver was taking beer , Harris was snoring at my side , the courier , with folded arms and bowed head , was sleeping on the box , two dozen barefooted and bareheaded children were gathered about the carriage , with their hands crossed behind , gazing up with serious and innocent admiration at the dozing tourists baking there in the sun .
Parsing [sent. 3817 len. 31]: Several small girls held night-capped babies nearly as big as themselves in their arms , and even these fat babies seemed to take a sort of sluggish interest in us .
Parsing [sent. 3818 len. 14]: We had slept an hour and a half and missed all the scenery !
Parsing [sent. 3819 len. 10]: I did not need anybody to tell me that .
Parsing [sent. 3820 len. 14]: If I had been a girl , I could have cursed for vexation .
Parsing [sent. 3821 len. 18]: As it was , I woke up the agent and gave him a piece of my mind .
Parsing [sent. 3822 len. 16]: Instead of being humiliated , he only upbraided me for being so wanting in vigilance .
Parsing [sent. 3823 len. 45]: He said he had expected to improve his mind by coming to Europe , but a man might travel to the ends of the earth with me and never see anything , for I was manifestly endowed with the very genius of ill luck .
Parsing [sent. 3824 len. 28]: He even tried to get up some emotion about that poor courier , who never got a chance to see anything , on account of my heedlessness .
Parsing [sent. 3825 len. 40]: But when I thought I had borne about enough of this kind of talk , I threatened to make Harris tramp back to the summit and make a report on that scenery , and this suggestion spiked his battery .
Parsing [sent. 3826 len. 52]: We drove sullenly through Brienz , dead to the seductions of its bewildering array of Swiss carvings and the clamorous HOO-hooing of its cuckoo clocks , and had not entirely recovered our spirits when we rattled across a bridge over the rushing blue river and entered the pretty town of Interlaken .
Parsing [sent. 3827 len. 18]: It was just about sunset , and we had made the trip from Lucerne in ten hours .
Parsing [sent. 3828 len. 42]: CHAPTER XXXII -LSB- The Jungfrau , the Bride , and the Piano -RSB- We located ourselves at the Jungfrau Hotel , one of those huge establishments which the needs of modern travel have created in every attractive spot on the continent .
Parsing [sent. 3829 len. 20]: There was a great gathering at dinner , and , as usual , one heard all sorts of languages .
Parsing [sent. 3830 len. 19]: The table d'hôte was served by waitresses dressed in the quaint and comely costume of the Swiss peasants .
Parsing [sent. 3831 len. 59]: This consists of a simple gros de laine , trimmed with ashes of roses , with overskirt of scare bleu ventre saint gris , cut bias on the off-side , with facings of petit polonaise and narrow insertions of pâte de foie gras backstitched to the mise en sce ` ne in the form of a jeu d'esprit .
Parsing [sent. 3832 len. 12]: It gives to the wearer a singularly piquant and alluring aspect .
Parsing [sent. 3833 len. 18]: One of these waitresses , a woman of forty , had side-whiskers reaching half-way down her jaws .
Parsing [sent. 3834 len. 21]: They were two fingers broad , dark in color , pretty thick , and the hairs were an inch long .
Parsing [sent. 3835 len. 28]: One sees many women on the continent with quite conspicuous mustaches , but this was the only woman I saw who had reached the dignity of whiskers .
Parsing [sent. 3836 len. 68]: After dinner the guests of both sexes distributed themselves about the front porches and the ornamental grounds belonging to the hotel , to enjoy the cool air ; but , as the twilight deepened toward darkness , they gathered themselves together in that saddest and solemnest and most constrained of all places , the great blank drawing-room which is the chief feature of all continental summer hotels .
Parsing [sent. 3837 len. 25]: There they grouped themselves about , in couples and threes , and mumbled in bated voices , and looked timid and homeless and forlorn .
Parsing [sent. 3838 len. 34]: There was a small piano in this room , a clattery , wheezy , asthmatic thing , certainly the very worst miscarriage in the way of a piano that the world has seen .
Parsing [sent. 3839 len. 27]: In turn , five or six dejected and homesick ladies approached it doubtingly , gave it a single inquiring thump , and retired with the lockjaw .
Parsing [sent. 3840 len. 21]: But the boss of that instrument was to come , nevertheless ; and from my own country -- from Arkansaw .
Parsing [sent. 3841 len. 64]: She was a brand-new bride , innocent , girlish , happy in herself and her grave and worshiping stripling of a husband ; she was about eighteen , just out of school , free from affectations , unconscious of that passionless multitude around her ; and the very first time she smote that old wreck one recognized that it had met its destiny .
Parsing [sent. 3842 len. 38]: Her stripling brought an armful of aged sheet-music from their room -- for this bride went `` heeled , '' as you might say -- and bent himself lovingly over and got ready to turn the pages .
Parsing [sent. 3843 len. 43]: The bride fetched a swoop with her fingers from one end of the keyboard to the other , just to get her bearings , as it were , and you could see the congregation set their teeth with the agony of it .
Parsing [sent. 3844 len. 35]: Then , without any more preliminaries , she turned on all the horrors of the `` Battle of Prague , '' that venerable shivaree , and waded chin-deep in the blood of the slain .
Parsing [sent. 3845 len. 28]: She made a fair and honorable average of two false notes in every five , but her soul was in arms and she never stopped to correct .
Parsing [sent. 3846 len. 37]: The audience stood it with pretty fair grit for a while , but when the cannonade waxed hotter and fiercer , and the discord average rose to four in five , the procession began to move .
Parsing [sent. 3847 len. 42]: A few stragglers held their ground ten minutes longer , but when the girl began to wring the true inwardness out of the `` cries of the wounded , '' they struck their colors and retired in a kind of panic .
Parsing [sent. 3848 len. 17]: There never was a completer victory ; I was the only non-combatant left on the field .
Parsing [sent. 3849 len. 19]: I would not have deserted my countrywoman anyhow , but indeed I had no desires in that direction .
Parsing [sent. 3850 len. 12]: None of us like mediocrity , but we all reverence perfection .
Parsing [sent. 3851 len. 29]: This girl 's music was perfection in its way ; it was the worst music that had ever been achieved on our planet by a mere human being .
Parsing [sent. 3852 len. 11]: I moved up close , and never lost a strain .
Parsing [sent. 3853 len. 13]: When she got through , I asked her to play it again .
Parsing [sent. 3854 len. 12]: She did it with a pleased alacrity and a heightened enthusiasm .
Parsing [sent. 3855 len. 9]: She made it ALL discords , this time .
Parsing [sent. 3856 len. 21]: She got an amount of anguish into the cries of the wounded that shed a new light on human suffering .
Parsing [sent. 3857 len. 9]: She was on the war-path all the evening .
Parsing [sent. 3858 len. 30]: All the time , crowds of people gathered on the porches and pressed their noses against the windows to look and marvel , but the bravest never ventured in .
Parsing [sent. 3859 len. 26]: The bride went off satisfied and happy with her young fellow , when her appetite was finally gorged , and the tourists swarmed in again .
Parsing [sent. 3860 len. 18]: What a change has come over Switzerland , and in fact all Europe , during this century !
Parsing [sent. 3861 len. 87]: Seventy or eighty years ago Napoleon was the only man in Europe who could really be called a traveler ; he was the only man who had devoted his attention to it and taken a powerful interest in it ; he was the only man who had traveled extensively ; but now everybody goes everywhere ; and Switzerland , and many other regions which were unvisited and unknown remotenesses a hundred years ago , are in our days a buzzing hive of restless strangers every summer .
Parsing [sent. 3862 len. 4]: But I digress .
Parsing [sent. 3863 len. 18]: In the morning , when we looked out of our windows , we saw a wonderful sight .
Parsing [sent. 3864 len. 36]: Across the valley , and apparently quite neighborly and close at hand , the giant form of the Jungfrau rose cold and white into the clear sky , beyond a gateway in the nearer highlands .
Parsing [sent. 3865 len. 47]: It reminded me , somehow , of one of those colossal billows which swells suddenly up beside one 's ship , at sea , sometimes , with its crest and shoulders snowy white , and the rest of its noble proportions streaked downward with creamy foam .
Parsing [sent. 3866 len. 20]: I took out my sketch-book and made a little picture of the Jungfrau , merely to get the shape .
Parsing [sent. 3867 len. 43]: I do not regard this as one of my finished works , in fact I do not rank it among my Works at all ; it is only a study ; it is hardly more than what one might call a sketch .
Parsing [sent. 3868 len. 31]: Other artists have done me the grace to admire it ; but I am severe in my judgments of my own pictures , and this one does not move me .
Parsing [sent. 3869 len. 35]: It was hard to believe that that lofty wooded rampart on the left which so overtops the Jungfrau was not actually the higher of the two , but it was not , of course .
Parsing [sent. 3870 len. 72]: It is only two or three thousand feet high , and of course has no snow upon it in summer , whereas the Jungfrau is not much shorter of fourteen thousand feet high and therefore that lowest verge of snow on her side , which seems nearly down to the valley level , is really about seven thousand feet higher up in the air than the summit of that wooded rampart .
Parsing [sent. 3871 len. 9]: It is the distance that makes the deception .
Parsing [sent. 3872 len. 25]: The wooded height is but four or five miles removed from us , but the Jungfrau is four or five times that distance away .
Parsing [sent. 3873 len. 33]: Walking down the street of shops , in the fore-noon , I was attracted by a large picture , carved , frame and all , from a single block of chocolate-colored wood .
Parsing [sent. 3874 len. 7]: There are people who know everything .
Parsing [sent. 3875 len. 18]: Some of these had told us that continental shopkeepers always raise their prices on English and Americans .
Parsing [sent. 3876 len. 25]: Many people had told us it was expensive to buy things through a courier , whereas I had supposed it was just the reverse .
Parsing [sent. 3877 len. 80]: When I saw this picture , I conjectured that it was worth more than the friend I proposed to buy it for would like to pay , but still it was worth while to inquire ; so I told the courier to step in and ask the price , as if he wanted it for himself ; I told him not to speak in English , and above all not to reveal the fact that he was a courier .
Parsing [sent. 3878 len. 11]: Then I moved on a few yards , and waited .
Parsing [sent. 3879 len. 9]: The courier came presently and reported the price .
Parsing [sent. 3880 len. 24]: I said to myself , `` It is a hundred francs too much , '' and so dismissed the matter from my mind .
Parsing [sent. 3881 len. 19]: But in the afternoon I was passing that place with Harris , and the picture attracted me again .
Parsing [sent. 3882 len. 16]: We stepped in , to see how much higher broken German would raise the price .
Parsing [sent. 3883 len. 16]: The shopwoman named a figure just a hundred francs lower than the courier had named .
Parsing [sent. 3884 len. 6]: This was a pleasant surprise .
Parsing [sent. 3885 len. 7]: I said I would take it .
Parsing [sent. 3886 len. 36]: After I had given directions as to where it was to be shipped , the shopwoman said , appealingly : `` If you please , do not let your courier know you bought it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3887 len. 6]: This was an unexpected remark .
Parsing [sent. 3888 len. 14]: I said : `` What makes you think I have a courier ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3889 len. 14]: `` Ah , that is very simple ; he told me himself . ''
Parsing [sent. 3890 len. 6]: `` He was very thoughtful .
Parsing [sent. 3891 len. 17]: But tell me -- why did you charge him more than you are charging me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3892 len. 19]: `` That is very simple , also : I do not have to pay you a percentage . ''
Parsing [sent. 3893 len. 8]: `` Oh , I begin to see .
Parsing [sent. 3894 len. 12]: You would have had to pay the courier a percentage . ''
Parsing [sent. 3895 len. 3]: `` Undoubtedly .
Parsing [sent. 3896 len. 7]: The courier always has his percentage .
Parsing [sent. 3897 len. 12]: In this case it would have been a hundred francs . ''
Parsing [sent. 3898 len. 20]: `` Then the tradesman does not pay a part of it -- the purchaser pays all of it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3899 len. 37]: `` There are occasions when the tradesman and the courier agree upon a price which is twice or thrice the value of the article , then the two divide , and both get a percentage . ''
Parsing [sent. 3900 len. 4]: `` I see .
Parsing [sent. 3901 len. 17]: But it seems to me that the purchaser does all the paying , even then . ''
Parsing [sent. 3902 len. 7]: `` Oh , to be sure !
Parsing [sent. 3903 len. 6]: It goes without saying . ''
Parsing [sent. 3904 len. 19]: `` But I have bought this picture myself ; therefore why should n't the courier know it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3905 len. 19]: The woman exclaimed , in distress : `` Ah , indeed it would take all my little profit !
Parsing [sent. 3906 len. 17]: He would come and demand his hundred francs , and I should have to pay . ''
Parsing [sent. 3907 len. 8]: `` He has not done the buying .
Parsing [sent. 3908 len. 5]: You could refuse . ''
Parsing [sent. 3909 len. 8]: `` I could not dare to refuse .
Parsing [sent. 3910 len. 8]: He would never bring travelers here again .
Parsing [sent. 3911 len. 28]: More than that , he would denounce me to the other couriers , they would divert custom from me , and my business would be injured . ''
Parsing [sent. 3912 len. 10]: I went away in a thoughtful frame of mind .
Parsing [sent. 3913 len. 20]: I began to see why a courier could afford to work for fifty-five dollars a month and his fares .
Parsing [sent. 3914 len. 51]: A month or two later I was able to understand why a courier did not have to pay any board and lodging , and why my hotel bills were always larger when I had him with me than when I left him behind , somewhere , for a few days .
Parsing [sent. 3915 len. 10]: Another thing was also explained , now , apparently .
Parsing [sent. 3916 len. 21]: In one town I had taken the courier to the bank to do the translating when I drew some money .
Parsing [sent. 3917 len. 12]: I had sat in the reading-room till the transaction was finished .
Parsing [sent. 3918 len. 48]: Then a clerk had brought the money to me in person , and had been exceedingly polite , even going so far as to precede me to the door and holding it open for me and bow me out as if I had been a distinguished personage .
Parsing [sent. 3919 len. 6]: It was a new experience .
Parsing [sent. 3920 len. 20]: Exchange had been in my favor ever since I had been in Europe , but just that one time .
Parsing [sent. 3921 len. 26]: I got simply the face of my draft , and no extra francs , whereas I had expected to get quite a number of them .
Parsing [sent. 3922 len. 15]: This was the first time I had ever used the courier at the bank .
Parsing [sent. 3923 len. 22]: I had suspected something then , and as long as he remained with me afterward I managed bank matters by myself .
Parsing [sent. 3924 len. 38]: Still , if I felt that I could afford the tax , I would never travel without a courier , for a good courier is a convenience whose value can not be estimated in dollars and cents .
Parsing [sent. 3925 len. 39]: Without him , travel is a bitter harassment , a purgatory of little exasperating annoyances , a ceaseless and pitiless punishment -- I mean to an irascible man who has no business capacity and is confused by details .
Parsing [sent. 3926 len. 27]: Without a courier , travel has n't a ray of pleasure in it , anywhere ; but with him it is a continuous and unruffled delight .
Parsing [sent. 3927 len. 54]: He is always at hand , never has to be sent for ; if your bell is not answered promptly -- and it seldom is -- you have only to open the door and speak , the courier will hear , and he will have the order attended to or raise an insurrection .
Parsing [sent. 3928 len. 22]: You tell him what day you will start , and whither you are going -- leave all the rest to him .
Parsing [sent. 3929 len. 21]: You need not inquire about trains , or fares , or car changes , or hotels , or anything else .
Parsing [sent. 3930 len. 41]: At the proper time he will put you in a cab or an omnibus , and drive you to the train or the boat ; he has packed your luggage and transferred it , he has paid all the bills .
Parsing [sent. 3931 len. 43]: Other people have preceded you half an hour to scramble for impossible places and lose their tempers , but you can take your time ; the courier has secured your seats for you , and you can occupy them at your leisure .
Parsing [sent. 3932 len. 171]: At the station , the crowd mash one another to pulp in the effort to get the weigher 's attention to their trunks ; they dispute hotly with these tyrants , who are cool and indifferent ; they get their baggage billets , at last , and then have another squeeze and another rage over the disheartening business of trying to get them recorded and paid for , and still another over the equally disheartening business of trying to get near enough to the ticket office to buy a ticket ; and now , with their tempers gone to the dogs , they must stand penned up and packed together , laden with wraps and satchels and shawl-straps , with the weary wife and babies , in the waiting-room , till the doors are thrown open -- and then all hands make a grand final rush to the train , find it full , and have to stand on the platform and fret until some more cars are put on .
Parsing [sent. 3933 len. 12]: They are in a condition to kill somebody by this time .
Parsing [sent. 3934 len. 22]: Meantime , you have been sitting in your car , smoking , and observing all this misery in the extremest comfort .
Parsing [sent. 3935 len. 37]: On the journey the guard is polite and watchful -- wo n't allow anybody to get into your compartment -- tells them you are just recovering from the small-pox and do not like to be disturbed .
Parsing [sent. 3936 len. 11]: For the courier has made everything right with the guard .
Parsing [sent. 3937 len. 45]: At way-stations the courier comes to your compartment to see if you want a glass of water , or a newspaper , or anything ; at eating-stations he sends luncheon out to you , while the other people scramble and worry in the dining-rooms .
Parsing [sent. 3938 len. 67]: If anything breaks about the car you are in , and a station-master proposes to pack you and your agent into a compartment with strangers , the courier reveals to him confidentially that you are a French duke born deaf and dumb , and the official comes and makes affable signs that he has ordered a choice car to be added to the train for you .
Parsing [sent. 3939 len. 41]: At custom-houses the multitude file tediously through , hot and irritated , and look on while the officers burrow into the trunks and make a mess of everything ; but you hand your keys to the courier and sit still .
Parsing [sent. 3940 len. 18]: Perhaps you arrive at your destination in a rain-storm at ten at night -- you generally do .
Parsing [sent. 3941 len. 65]: The multitude spend half an hour verifying their baggage and getting it transferred to the omnibuses ; but the courier puts you into a vehicle without a moment 's loss of time , and when you reach your hotel you find your rooms have been secured two or three days in advance , everything is ready , you can go at once to bed .
Parsing [sent. 3942 len. 25]: Some of those other people will have to drift around to two or three hotels , in the rain , before they find accommodations .
Parsing [sent. 3943 len. 49]: I have not set down half of the virtues that are vested in a good courier , but I think I have set down a sufficiency of them to show that an irritable man who can afford one and does not employ him is not a wise economist .
Parsing [sent. 3944 len. 21]: My courier was the worst one in Europe , yet he was a good deal better than none at all .
Parsing [sent. 3945 len. 25]: It could not pay him to be a better one than he was , because I could not afford to buy things through him .
Parsing [sent. 3946 len. 17]: He was a good enough courier for the small amount he got out of his service .
Parsing [sent. 3947 len. 18]: Yes , to travel with a courier is bliss , to travel without one is the reverse .
Parsing [sent. 3948 len. 25]: I have had dealings with some very bad couriers ; but I have also had dealings with one who might fairly be called perfection .
Parsing [sent. 3949 len. 11]: He was a young Polander , named Joseph N. Verey .
Parsing [sent. 3950 len. 92]: He spoke eight languages , and seemed to be equally at home in all of them ; he was shrewd , prompt , posted , and punctual ; he was fertile in resources , and singularly gifted in the matter of overcoming difficulties ; he not only knew how to do everything in his line , but he knew the best ways and the quickest ; he was handy with children and invalids ; all his employer needed to do was to take life easy and leave everything to the courier .
Parsing [sent. 3951 len. 26]: His address is , care of Messrs. Gay & Son , Strand , London ; he was formerly a conductor of Gay 's tourist parties .
Parsing [sent. 3952 len. 29]: Excellent couriers are somewhat rare ; if the reader is about to travel , he will find it to his advantage to make a note of this one .
Parsing [sent. 3953 len. 49]: CHAPTER XXXIII -LSB- We Climb Far -- by Buggy -RSB- The beautiful Giesbach Fall is near Interlaken , on the other side of the lake of Brienz , and is illuminated every night with those gorgeous theatrical fires whose name I can not call just at this moment .
Parsing [sent. 3954 len. 17]: This was said to be a spectacle which the tourist ought by no means to miss .
Parsing [sent. 3955 len. 21]: I was strongly tempted , but I could not go there with propriety , because one goes in a boat .
Parsing [sent. 3956 len. 23]: The task which I had set myself was to walk over Europe on foot , not skim over it in a boat .
Parsing [sent. 3957 len. 18]: I had made a tacit contract with myself ; it was my duty to abide by it .
Parsing [sent. 3958 len. 23]: I was willing to make boat trips for pleasure , but I could not conscientiously make them in the way of business .
Parsing [sent. 3959 len. 29]: It cost me something of a pang to lose that fine sight , but I lived down the desire , and gained in my self-respect through the triumph .
Parsing [sent. 3960 len. 15]: I had a finer and a grander sight , however , where I was .
Parsing [sent. 3961 len. 20]: This was the mighty dome of the Jungfrau softly outlined against the sky and faintly silvered by the starlight .
Parsing [sent. 3962 len. 52]: There was something subduing in the influence of that silent and solemn and awful presence ; one seemed to meet the immutable , the indestructible , the eternal , face to face , and to feel the trivial and fleeting nature of his own existence the more sharply by the contrast .
Parsing [sent. 3963 len. 83]: One had the sense of being under the brooding contemplation of a spirit , not an inert mass of rocks and ice -- a spirit which had looked down , through the slow drift of the ages , upon a million vanished races of men , and judged them ; and would judge a million more -- and still be there , watching , unchanged and unchangeable , after all life should be gone and the earth have become a vacant desolation .
Parsing [sent. 3964 len. 95]: While I was feeling these things , I was groping , without knowing it , toward an understanding of what the spell is which people find in the Alps , and in no other mountains -- that strange , deep , nameless influence , which , once felt , can not be forgotten -- once felt , leaves always behind it a restless longing to feel it again -- a longing which is like homesickness ; a grieving , haunting yearning which will plead , implore , and persecute till it has its will .
Parsing [sent. 3965 len. 36]: I met dozens of people , imaginative and unimaginative , cultivated and uncultivated , who had come from far countries and roamed through the Swiss Alps year after year -- they could not explain why .
Parsing [sent. 3966 len. 72]: They had come first , they said , out of idle curiosity , because everybody talked about it ; they had come since because they could not help it , and they should keep on coming , while they lived , for the same reason ; they had tried to break their chains and stay away , but it was futile ; now , they had no desire to break them .
Parsing [sent. 3967 len. 87]: Others came nearer formulating what they felt ; they said they could find perfect rest and peace nowhere else when they were troubled : all frets and worries and chafings sank to sleep in the presence of the benignant serenity of the Alps ; the Great Spirit of the Mountain breathed his own peace upon their hurt minds and sore hearts , and healed them ; they could not think base thoughts or do mean and sordid things here , before the visible throne of God .
Parsing [sent. 3968 len. 30]: Down the road a piece was a Kursaal -- whatever that may be -- and we joined the human tide to see what sort of enjoyment it might afford .
Parsing [sent. 3969 len. 57]: It was the usual open-air concert , in an ornamental garden , with wines , beer , milk , whey , grapes , etc. -- the whey and the grapes being necessaries of life to certain invalids whom physicians can not repair , and who only continue to exist by the grace of whey or grapes .
Parsing [sent. 3970 len. 47]: One of these departed spirits told me , in a sad and lifeless way , that there is no way for him to live but by whey , and dearly , dearly loved whey , he did n't know whey he did , but he did .
Parsing [sent. 3971 len. 15]: After making this pun he died -- that is the whey it served him .
Parsing [sent. 3972 len. 48]: Some other remains , preserved from decomposition by the grape system , told me that the grapes were of a peculiar breed , highly medicinal in their nature , and that they were counted out and administered by the grape-doctors as methodically as if they were pills .
Parsing [sent. 3973 len. 60]: The new patient , if very feeble , began with one grape before breakfast , took three during breakfast , a couple between meals , five at luncheon , three in the afternoon , seven at dinner , four for supper , and part of a grape just before going to bed , by way of a general regulator .
Parsing [sent. 3974 len. 45]: The quantity was gradually and regularly increased , according to the needs and capacities of the patient , until by and by you would find him disposing of his one grape per second all the day long , and his regular barrel per day .
Parsing [sent. 3975 len. 56]: He said that men cured in this way , and enabled to discard the grape system , never afterward got over the habit of talking as if they were dictating to a slow amanuensis , because they always made a pause between each two words while they sucked the substance out of an imaginary grape .
Parsing [sent. 3976 len. 10]: He said these were tedious people to talk with .
Parsing [sent. 3977 len. 41]: He said that men who had been cured by the other process were easily distinguished from the rest of mankind because they always tilted their heads back , between every two words , and swallowed a swig of imaginary whey .
Parsing [sent. 3978 len. 52]: He said it was an impressive thing to observe two men , who had been cured by the two processes , engaged in conversation -- said their pauses and accompanying movements were so continuous and regular that a stranger would think himself in the presence of a couple of automatic machines .
Parsing [sent. 3979 len. 20]: One finds out a great many wonderful things , by traveling , if he stumbles upon the right person .
Parsing [sent. 3980 len. 28]: I did not remain long at the Kursaal ; the music was good enough , but it seemed rather tame after the cyclone of that Arkansaw expert .
Parsing [sent. 3981 len. 32]: Besides , my adventurous spirit had conceived a formidable enterprise -- nothing less than a trip from Interlaken , by the Gemmi and Visp , clear to Zermatt , on foot !
Parsing [sent. 3982 len. 17]: So it was necessary to plan the details , and get ready for an early start .
Parsing [sent. 3983 len. 34]: The courier -LRB- this was not the one I have just been speaking of -RRB- thought that the portier of the hotel would be able to tell us how to find our way .
Parsing [sent. 3984 len. 6]: And so it turned out .
Parsing [sent. 3985 len. 44]: He showed us the whole thing , on a relief-map , and we could see our route , with all its elevations and depressions , its villages and its rivers , as clearly as if we were sailing over it in a balloon .
Parsing [sent. 3986 len. 7]: A relief-map is a great thing .
Parsing [sent. 3987 len. 39]: The portier also wrote down each day 's journey and the nightly hotel on a piece of paper , and made our course so plain that we should never be able to get lost without high-priced outside help .
Parsing [sent. 3988 len. 40]: I put the courier in the care of a gentleman who was going to Lausanne , and then we went to bed , after laying out the walking-costumes and putting them into condition for instant occupation in the morning .
Parsing [sent. 3989 len. 32]: However , when we came down to breakfast at 8 A.M. , it looked so much like rain that I hired a two-horse top-buggy for the first third of the journey .
Parsing [sent. 3990 len. 42]: For two or three hours we jogged along the level road which skirts the beautiful lake of Thun , with a dim and dreamlike picture of watery expanses and spectral Alpine forms always before us , veiled in a mellowing mist .
Parsing [sent. 3991 len. 15]: Then a steady downpour set in , and hid everything but the nearest objects .
Parsing [sent. 3992 len. 41]: We kept the rain out of our faces with umbrellas , and away from our bodies with the leather apron of the buggy ; but the driver sat unsheltered and placidly soaked the weather in and seemed to like it .
Parsing [sent. 3993 len. 15]: We had the road to ourselves , and I never had a pleasanter excursion .
Parsing [sent. 3994 len. 42]: The weather began to clear while we were driving up a valley called the Kienthal , and presently a vast black cloud-bank in front of us dissolved away and uncurtained the grand proportions and the soaring loftiness of the Blumis Alp .
Parsing [sent. 3995 len. 27]: It was a sort of breath-taking surprise ; for we had not supposed there was anything behind that low-hung blanket of sable cloud but level valley .
Parsing [sent. 3996 len. 34]: What we had been mistaking for fleeting glimpses of sky away aloft there , were really patches of the Blumis 's snowy crest caught through shredded rents in the drifting pall of vapor .
Parsing [sent. 3997 len. 49]: We dined in the inn at Frutigen , and our driver ought to have dined there , too , but he would not have had time to dine and get drunk both , so he gave his mind to making a masterpiece of the latter , and succeeded .
Parsing [sent. 3998 len. 54]: A German gentleman and his two young-lady daughters had been taking their nooning at the inn , and when they left , just ahead of us , it was plain that their driver was as drunk as ours , and as happy and good-natured , too , which was saying a good deal .
Parsing [sent. 3999 len. 19]: These rascals overflowed with attentions and information for their guests , and with brotherly love for each other .
Parsing [sent. 4000 len. 34]: They tied their reins , and took off their coats and hats , so that they might be able to give unencumbered attention to conversation and to the gestures necessary for its illustration .
Parsing [sent. 4001 len. 51]: The road was smooth ; it led up and over and down a continual succession of hills ; but it was narrow , the horses were used to it , and could not well get out of it anyhow ; so why should n't the drivers entertain themselves and us ?
Parsing [sent. 4002 len. 51]: The noses of our horses projected sociably into the rear of the forward carriage , and as we toiled up the long hills our driver stood up and talked to his friend , and his friend stood up and talked back to him , with his rear to the scenery .
Parsing [sent. 4003 len. 22]: When the top was reached and we went flying down the other side , there was no change in the program .
Parsing [sent. 4004 len. 92]: I carry in my memory yet the picture of that forward driver , on his knees on his high seat , resting his elbows on its back , and beaming down on his passengers , with happy eye , and flying hair , and jolly red face , and offering his card to the old German gentleman while he praised his hack and horses , and both teams were whizzing down a long hill with nobody in a position to tell whether we were bound to destruction or an undeserved safety .
Parsing [sent. 4005 len. 56]: Toward sunset we entered a beautiful green valley dotted with chalets , a cozy little domain hidden away from the busy world in a cloistered nook among giant precipices topped with snowy peaks that seemed to float like islands above the curling surf of the sea of vapor that severed them from the lower world .
Parsing [sent. 4006 len. 54]: Down from vague and vaporous heights , little ruffled zigzag milky currents came crawling , and found their way to the verge of one of those tremendous overhanging walls , whence they plunged , a shaft of silver , shivered to atoms in mid-descent and turned to an air puff of luminous dust .
Parsing [sent. 4007 len. 33]: Here and there , in grooved depressions among the snowy desolations of the upper altitudes , one glimpsed the extremity of a glacier , with its sea-green and honeycombed battlements of ice .
Parsing [sent. 4008 len. 21]: Up the valley , under a dizzy precipice , nestled the village of Kandersteg , our halting-place for the night .
Parsing [sent. 4009 len. 11]: We were soon there , and housed in the hotel .
Parsing [sent. 4010 len. 56]: But the waning day had such an inviting influence that we did not remain housed many moments , but struck out and followed a roaring torrent of ice-water up to its far source in a sort of little grass-carpeted parlor , walled in all around by vast precipices and overlooked by clustering summits of ice .
Parsing [sent. 4011 len. 26]: This was the snuggest little croquet-ground imaginable ; it was perfectly level , and not more than a mile long by half a mile wide .
Parsing [sent. 4012 len. 40]: The walls around it were so gigantic , and everything about it was on so mighty a scale that it was belittled , by contrast , to what I have likened it to -- a cozy and carpeted parlor .
Parsing [sent. 4013 len. 18]: It was so high above the Kandersteg valley that there was nothing between it and the snowy-peaks .
Parsing [sent. 4014 len. 48]: I had never been in such intimate relations with the high altitudes before ; the snow-peaks had always been remote and unapproachable grandeurs , hitherto , but now we were hob-a-nob -- if one may use such a seemingly irreverent expression about creations so august as these .
Parsing [sent. 4015 len. 55]: We could see the streams which fed the torrent we had followed issuing from under the greenish ramparts of glaciers ; but two or three of these , instead of flowing over the precipices , sank down into the rock and sprang in big jets out of holes in the mid-face of the walls .
Parsing [sent. 4016 len. 13]: The green nook which I have been describing is called the Gasternthal .
Parsing [sent. 4017 len. 60]: The glacier streams gather and flow through it in a broad and rushing brook to a narrow cleft between lofty precipices ; here the rushing brook becomes a mad torrent and goes booming and thundering down toward Kandersteg , lashing and thrashing its way over and among monster boulders , and hurling chance roots and logs about like straws .
Parsing [sent. 4018 len. 10]: There was no lack of cascades along this route .
Parsing [sent. 4019 len. 59]: The path by the side of the torrent was so narrow that one had to look sharp , when he heard a cow-bell , and hunt for a place that was wide enough to accommodate a cow and a Christian side by side , and such places were not always to be had at an instant 's notice .
Parsing [sent. 4020 len. 40]: The cows wear church-bells , and that is a good idea in the cows , for where that torrent is , you could n't hear an ordinary cow-bell any further than you could hear the ticking of a watch .
Parsing [sent. 4021 len. 39]: I needed exercise , so I employed my agent in setting stranded logs and dead trees adrift , and I sat on a boulder and watched them go whirling and leaping head over heels down the boiling torrent .
Parsing [sent. 4022 len. 7]: It was a wonderfully exhilarating spectacle .
Parsing [sent. 4023 len. 24]: When I had had enough exercise , I made the agent take some , by running a race with one of those logs .
Parsing [sent. 4024 len. 10]: I made a trifle by betting on the log .
Parsing [sent. 4025 len. 48]: After dinner we had a walk up and down the Kandersteg valley , in the soft gloaming , with the spectacle of the dying lights of day playing about the crests and pinnacles of the still and solemn upper realm for contrast , and text for talk .
Parsing [sent. 4026 len. 20]: There were no sounds but the dulled complaining of the torrent and the occasional tinkling of a distant bell .
Parsing [sent. 4027 len. 35]: The spirit of the place was a sense of deep , pervading peace ; one might dream his life tranquilly away there , and not miss it or mind it when it was gone .
Parsing [sent. 4028 len. 14]: The summer departed with the sun , and winter came with the stars .
Parsing [sent. 4029 len. 74]: It grew to be a bitter night in that little hotel , backed up against a precipice that had no visible top to it , but we kept warm , and woke in time in the morning to find that everybody else had left for Gemmi three hours before -- so our little plan of helping that German family -LRB- principally the old man -RRB- over the pass , was a blocked generosity .
Parsing [sent. 4030 len. 24]: CHAPTER XXXIV -LSB- The World 's Highest Pig Farm -RSB- We hired the only guide left , to lead us on our way .
Parsing [sent. 4031 len. 25]: He was over seventy , but he could have given me nine-tenths of his strength and still had all his age entitled him to .
Parsing [sent. 4032 len. 19]: He shouldered our satchels , overcoats , and alpenstocks , and we set out up the steep path .
Parsing [sent. 4033 len. 5]: It was hot work .
Parsing [sent. 4034 len. 55]: The old man soon begged us to hand over our coats and waistcoats to him to carry , too , and we did it ; one could not refuse so little a thing to a poor old man like that ; he should have had them if he had been a hundred and fifty .
Parsing [sent. 4035 len. 28]: When we began that ascent , we could see a microscopic chalet perched away up against heaven on what seemed to be the highest mountain near us .
Parsing [sent. 4036 len. 14]: It was on our right , across the narrow head of the valley .
Parsing [sent. 4037 len. 43]: But when we got up abreast it on its own level , mountains were towering high above on every hand , and we saw that its altitude was just about that of the little Gasternthal which we had visited the evening before .
Parsing [sent. 4038 len. 20]: Still it seemed a long way up in the air , in that waste and lonely wilderness of rocks .
Parsing [sent. 4039 len. 69]: It had an unfenced grass-plot in front of it which seemed about as big as a billiard-table , and this grass-plot slanted so sharply downward , and was so brief , and ended so exceedingly soon at the verge of the absolute precipice , that it was a shuddery thing to think of a person 's venturing to trust his foot on an incline so situated at all .
Parsing [sent. 4040 len. 43]: Suppose a man stepped on an orange peel in that yard ; there would be nothing for him to seize ; nothing could keep him from rolling ; five revolutions would bring him to the edge , and over he would go .
Parsing [sent. 4041 len. 8]: What a frightful distance he would fall !
Parsing [sent. 4042 len. 15]: -- for there are very few birds that fly as high as his starting-point .
Parsing [sent. 4043 len. 25]: He would strike and bounce , two or three times , on his way down , but this would be no advantage to him .
Parsing [sent. 4044 len. 20]: I would as soon take an airing on the slant of a rainbow as in such a front yard .
Parsing [sent. 4045 len. 27]: I would rather , in fact , for the distance down would be about the same , and it is pleasanter to slide than to bounce .
Parsing [sent. 4046 len. 24]: I could not see how the peasants got up to that chalet -- the region seemed too steep for anything but a balloon .
Parsing [sent. 4047 len. 71]: As we strolled on , climbing up higher and higher , we were continually bringing neighboring peaks into view and lofty prominence which had been hidden behind lower peaks before ; so by and by , while standing before a group of these giants , we looked around for the chalet again ; there it was , away down below us , apparently on an inconspicuous ridge in the valley !
Parsing [sent. 4048 len. 22]: It was as far below us , now , as it had been above us when we were beginning the ascent .
Parsing [sent. 4049 len. 43]: After a while the path led us along a railed precipice , and we looked over -- far beneath us was the snug parlor again , the little Gasternthal , with its water jets spouting from the face of its rock walls .
Parsing [sent. 4050 len. 9]: We could have dropped a stone into it .
Parsing [sent. 4051 len. 66]: We had been finding the top of the world all along -- and always finding a still higher top stealing into view in a disappointing way just ahead ; when we looked down into the Gasternthal we felt pretty sure that we had reached the genuine top at last , but it was not so ; there were much higher altitudes to be scaled yet .
Parsing [sent. 4052 len. 34]: We were still in the pleasant shade of forest trees , we were still in a region which was cushioned with beautiful mosses and aglow with the many-tinted luster of innumerable wild flowers .
Parsing [sent. 4053 len. 16]: We found , indeed , more interest in the wild flowers than in anything else .
Parsing [sent. 4054 len. 21]: We gathered a specimen or two of every kind which we were unacquainted with ; so we had sumptuous bouquets .
Parsing [sent. 4055 len. 34]: But one of the chief interests lay in chasing the seasons of the year up the mountain , and determining them by the presence of flowers and berries which we were acquainted with .
Parsing [sent. 4056 len. 56]: For instance , it was the end of August at the level of the sea ; in the Kandersteg valley at the base of the pass , we found flowers which would not be due at the sea-level for two or three weeks ; higher up , we entered October , and gathered fringed gentians .
Parsing [sent. 4057 len. 25]: I made no notes , and have forgotten the details , but the construction of the floral calendar was very entertaining while it lasted .
Parsing [sent. 4058 len. 33]: In the high regions we found rich store of the splendid red flower called the Alpine rose , but we did not find any examples of the ugly Swiss favorite called Edelweiss .
Parsing [sent. 4059 len. 17]: Its name seems to indicate that it is a noble flower and that it is white .
Parsing [sent. 4060 len. 18]: It may be noble enough , but it is not attractive , and it is not white .
Parsing [sent. 4061 len. 24]: The fuzzy blossom is the color of bad cigar ashes , and appears to be made of a cheap quality of gray plush .
Parsing [sent. 4062 len. 56]: It has a noble and distant way of confining itself to the high altitudes , but that is probably on account of its looks ; it apparently has no monopoly of those upper altitudes , however , for they are sometimes intruded upon by some of the loveliest of the valley families of wild flowers .
Parsing [sent. 4063 len. 13]: Everybody in the Alps wears a sprig of Edelweiss in his hat .
Parsing [sent. 4064 len. 13]: It is the native 's pet , and also the tourist 's .
Parsing [sent. 4065 len. 40]: All the morning , as we loafed along , having a good time , other pedestrians went staving by us with vigorous strides , and with the intent and determined look of men who were walking for a wager .
Parsing [sent. 4066 len. 14]: These wore loose knee-breeches , long yarn stockings , and hobnailed high-laced walking-shoes .
Parsing [sent. 4067 len. 24]: They were gentlemen who would go home to England or Germany and tell how many miles they had beaten the guide-book every day .
Parsing [sent. 4068 len. 53]: But I doubted if they ever had much real fun , outside of the mere magnificent exhilaration of the tramp through the green valleys and the breezy heights ; for they were almost always alone , and even the finest scenery loses incalculably when there is no one to enjoy it with .
Parsing [sent. 4069 len. 27]: All the morning an endless double procession of mule-mounted tourists filed past us along the narrow path -- the one procession going , the other coming .
Parsing [sent. 4070 len. 49]: We had taken a good deal of trouble to teach ourselves the kindly German custom of saluting all strangers with doffed hat , and we resolutely clung to it , that morning , although it kept us bareheaded most of the time and was not always responded to .
Parsing [sent. 4071 len. 24]: Still we found an interest in the thing , because we naturally liked to know who were English and Americans among the passers-by .
Parsing [sent. 4072 len. 30]: All continental natives responded of course ; so did some of the English and Americans , but , as a general thing , these two races gave no sign .
Parsing [sent. 4073 len. 41]: Whenever a man or a woman showed us cold neglect , we spoke up confidently in our own tongue and asked for such information as we happened to need , and we always got a reply in the same language .
Parsing [sent. 4074 len. 27]: The English and American folk are not less kindly than other races , they are only more reserved , and that comes of habit and education .
Parsing [sent. 4075 len. 28]: In one dreary , rocky waste , away above the line of vegetation , we met a procession of twenty-five mounted young men , all from America .
Parsing [sent. 4076 len. 31]: We got answering bows enough from these , of course , for they were of an age to learn to do in Rome as Rome does , without much effort .
Parsing [sent. 4077 len. 52]: At one extremity of this patch of desolation , overhung by bare and forbidding crags which husbanded drifts of everlasting snow in their shaded cavities , was a small stretch of thin and discouraged grass , and a man and a family of pigs were actually living here in some shanties .
Parsing [sent. 4078 len. 23]: Consequently this place could be really reckoned as `` property '' ; it had a money value , and was doubtless taxed .
Parsing [sent. 4079 len. 15]: I think it must have marked the limit of real estate in this world .
Parsing [sent. 4080 len. 26]: It would be hard to set a money value upon any piece of earth that lies between that spot and the empty realm of space .
Parsing [sent. 4081 len. 30]: That man may claim the distinction of owning the end of the world , for if there is any definite end to the world he has certainly found it .
Parsing [sent. 4082 len. 12]: From here forward we moved through a storm-swept and smileless desolation .
Parsing [sent. 4083 len. 40]: All about us rose gigantic masses , crags , and ramparts of bare and dreary rock , with not a vestige or semblance of plant or tree or flower anywhere , or glimpse of any creature that had life .
Parsing [sent. 4084 len. 50]: The frost and the tempests of unnumbered ages had battered and hacked at these cliffs , with a deathless energy , destroying them piecemeal ; so all the region about their bases was a tumbled chaos of great fragments which had been split off and hurled to the ground .
Parsing [sent. 4085 len. 12]: Soiled and aged banks of snow lay close about our path .
Parsing [sent. 4086 len. 20]: The ghastly desolation of the place was as tremendously complete as if Doré had furnished the working-plans for it .
Parsing [sent. 4087 len. 69]: But every now and then , through the stern gateways around us we caught a view of some neighboring majestic dome , sheathed with glittering ice , and displaying its white purity at an elevation compared to which ours was groveling and plebeian , and this spectacle always chained one 's interest and admiration at once , and made him forget there was anything ugly in the world .
Parsing [sent. 4088 len. 21]: I have just said that there was nothing but death and desolation in these hideous places , but I forgot .
Parsing [sent. 4089 len. 106]: In the most forlorn and arid and dismal one of all , where the racked and splintered debris was thickest , where the ancient patches of snow lay against the very path , where the winds blew bitterest and the general aspect was mournfulest and dreariest , and furthest from any suggestion of cheer or hope , I found a solitary wee forget-me-not flourishing away , not a droop about it anywhere , but holding its bright blue star up with the prettiest and gallantest air in the world , the only happy spirit , the only smiling thing , in all that grisly desert .
Parsing [sent. 4090 len. 9]: She seemed to say , `` Cheer up !
Parsing [sent. 4091 len. 17]: -- as long as we are here , let us make the best of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4092 len. 75]: I judged she had earned a right to a more hospitable place ; so I plucked her up and sent her to America to a friend who would respect her for the fight she had made , all by her small self , to make a whole vast despondent Alpine desolation stop breaking its heart over the unalterable , and hold up its head and look at the bright side of things for once .
Parsing [sent. 4093 len. 15]: We stopped for a nooning at a strongly built little inn called the Schwarenbach .
Parsing [sent. 4094 len. 46]: It sits in a lonely spot among the peaks , where it is swept by the trailing fringes of the cloud-rack , and is rained on , and snowed on , and pelted and persecuted by the storms , nearly every day of its life .
Parsing [sent. 4095 len. 11]: It was the only habitation in the whole Gemmi Pass .
Parsing [sent. 4096 len. 15]: Close at hand , now , was a chance for a blood-curdling Alpine adventure .
Parsing [sent. 4097 len. 24]: Close at hand was the snowy mass of the Great Altels cooling its topknot in the sky and daring us to an ascent .
Parsing [sent. 4098 len. 27]: I was fired with the idea , and immediately made up my mind to procure the necessary guides , ropes , etc. , and undertake it .
Parsing [sent. 4099 len. 18]: I instructed Harris to go to the landlord of the inn and set him about our preparations .
Parsing [sent. 4100 len. 36]: Meantime , I went diligently to work to read up and find out what this much-talked-of mountain-climbing was like , and how one should go about it -- for in these matters I was ignorant .
Parsing [sent. 4101 len. 26]: I opened Mr. Hinchliff 's SUMMER MONTHS AMONG THE ALPS -LRB- published 1857 -RRB- , and selected his account of his ascent of Monte Rosa .
Parsing [sent. 4102 len. 77]: It began : `` It is very difficult to free the mind from excitement on the evening before a grand expedition -- '' I saw that I was too calm ; so I walked the room a while and worked myself into a high excitement ; but the book 's next remark -- that the adventurer must get up at two in the morning -- came as near as anything to flatting it all out again .
Parsing [sent. 4103 len. 90]: However , I reinforced it , and read on , about how Mr. Hinchliff dressed by candle-light and was `` soon down among the guides , who were bustling about in the passage , packing provisions , and making every preparation for the start '' ; and how he glanced out into the cold clear night and saw that -- `` The whole sky was blazing with stars , larger and brighter than they appear through the dense atmosphere breathed by inhabitants of the lower parts of the earth .
Parsing [sent. 4104 len. 57]: They seemed actually suspended from the dark vault of heaven , and their gentle light shed a fairylike gleam over the snow-fields around the foot of the Matterhorn , which raised its stupendous pinnacle on high , penetrating to the heart of the Great Bear , and crowning itself with a diadem of his magnificent stars .
Parsing [sent. 4105 len. 48]: Not a sound disturbed the deep tranquillity of the night , except the distant roar of streams which rush from the high plateau of the St. Theodule glacier , and fall headlong over precipitous rocks till they lose themselves in the mazes of the Gorner glacier . ''
Parsing [sent. 4106 len. 32]: He took his hot toast and coffee , and then about half past three his caravan of ten men filed away from the Riffel Hotel , and began the steep climb .
Parsing [sent. 4107 len. 49]: At half past five he happened to turn around , and `` beheld the glorious spectacle of the Matterhorn , just touched by the rosy-fingered morning , and looking like a huge pyramid of fire rising out of the barren ocean of ice and rock around it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4108 len. 56]: Then the Breithorn and the Dent Blanche caught the radiant glow ; but `` the intervening mass of Monte Rosa made it necessary for us to climb many long hours before we could hope to see the sun himself , yet the whole air soon grew warmer after the splendid birth of the day . ''
Parsing [sent. 4109 len. 43]: He gazed at the lofty crown of Monte Rosa and the wastes of snow that guarded its steep approaches , and the chief guide delivered the opinion that no man could conquer their awful heights and put his foot upon that summit .
Parsing [sent. 4110 len. 9]: But the adventurers moved steadily on , nevertheless .
Parsing [sent. 4111 len. 60]: They toiled up , and up , and still up ; they passed the Grand Plateau ; then toiled up a steep shoulder of the mountain , clinging like flies to its rugged face ; and now they were confronted by a tremendous wall from which great blocks of ice and snow were evidently in the habit of falling .
Parsing [sent. 4112 len. 50]: They turned aside to skirt this wall , and gradually ascended until their way was barred by a `` maze of gigantic snow crevices , '' -- so they turned aside again , and `` began a long climb of sufficient steepness to make a zigzag course necessary . ''
Parsing [sent. 4113 len. 13]: Fatigue compelled them to halt frequently , for a moment or two .
Parsing [sent. 4114 len. 16]: At one of these halts somebody called out , `` Look at Mont Blanc ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4115 len. 44]: and `` we were at once made aware of the very great height we had attained by actually seeing the monarch of the Alps and his attendant satellites right over the top of the Breithorn , itself at least 14,000 feet high ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4116 len. 55]: These people moved in single file , and were all tied to a strong rope , at regular distances apart , so that if one of them slipped on those giddy heights , the others could brace themselves on their alpenstocks and save him from darting into the valley , thousands of feet below .
Parsing [sent. 4117 len. 28]: By and by they came to an ice-coated ridge which was tilted up at a sharp angle , and had a precipice on one side of it .
Parsing [sent. 4118 len. 47]: They had to climb this , so the guide in the lead cut steps in the ice with his hatchet , and as fast as he took his toes out of one of these slight holes , the toes of the man behind him occupied it .
Parsing [sent. 4119 len. 106]: `` Slowly and steadily we kept on our way over this dangerous part of the ascent , and I dare say it was fortunate for some of us that attention was distracted from the head by the paramount necessity of looking after the feet ; FOR , WHILE ON THE LEFT THE INCLINE OF ICE WAS SO STEEP THAT IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR ANY MAN TO SAVE HIMSELF IN CASE OF A SLIP , UNLESS THE OTHERS COULD HOLD HIM UP , ON THE RIGHT WE MIGHT DROP A PEBBLE FROM THE HAND OVER PRECIPICES OF UNKNOWN EXTENT DOWN UPON THE TREMENDOUS GLACIER BELOW .
Parsing [sent. 4120 len. 42]: `` Great caution , therefore , was absolutely necessary , and in this exposed situation we were attacked by all the fury of that grand enemy of aspirants to Monte Rosa -- a severe and bitterly cold wind from the north .
Parsing [sent. 4121 len. 46]: The fine powdery snow was driven past us in the clouds , penetrating the interstices of our clothes , and the pieces of ice which flew from the blows of Peter 's ax were whisked into the air , and then dashed over the precipice .
Parsing [sent. 4122 len. 46]: We had quite enough to do to prevent ourselves from being served in the same ruthless fashion , and now and then , in the more violent gusts of wind , were glad to stick our alpenstocks into the ice and hold on hard . ''
Parsing [sent. 4123 len. 143]: Having surmounted this perilous steep , they sat down and took a brief rest with their backs against a sheltering rock and their heels dangling over a bottomless abyss ; then they climbed to the base of another ridge -- a more difficult and dangerous one still : `` The whole of the ridge was exceedingly narrow , and the fall on each side desperately steep , but the ice in some of these intervals between the masses of rock assumed the form of a mere sharp edge , almost like a knife ; these places , though not more than three or four short paces in length , looked uncommonly awkward ; but , like the sword leading true believers to the gates of Paradise , they must needs be passed before we could attain to the summit of our ambition .
Parsing [sent. 4124 len. 62]: These were in one or two places so narrow , that in stepping over them with toes well turned out for greater security , ONE END OF THE FOOT PROJECTED OVER THE AWFUL PRECIPICE ON THE RIGHT , WHILE THE OTHER WAS ON THE BEGINNING OF THE ICE SLOPE ON THE LEFT , WHICH WAS SCARCELY LESS STEEP THAN THE ROCKS .
Parsing [sent. 4125 len. 97]: On these occasions Peter would take my hand , and each of us stretching as far as we could , he was thus enabled to get a firm footing two paces or rather more from me , whence a spring would probably bring him to the rock on the other side ; then , turning around , he called to me to come , and , taking a couple of steps carefully , I was met at the third by his outstretched hand ready to clasp mine , and in a moment stood by his side .
Parsing [sent. 4126 len. 9]: The others followed in much the same fashion .
Parsing [sent. 4127 len. 92]: Once my right foot slipped on the side toward the precipice , but I threw out my left arm in a moment so that it caught the icy edge under my armpit as I fell , and supported me considerably ; at the same instant I cast my eyes down the side on which I had slipped , and contrived to plant my right foot on a piece of rock as large as a cricket-ball , which chanced to protrude through the ice , on the very edge of the precipice .
Parsing [sent. 4128 len. 69]: Being thus anchored fore and aft , as it were , I believe I could easily have recovered myself , even if I had been alone , though it must be confessed the situation would have been an awful one ; as it was , however , a jerk from Peter settled the matter very soon , and I was on my legs all right in an instant .
Parsing [sent. 4129 len. 13]: The rope is an immense help in places of this kind . ''
Parsing [sent. 4130 len. 39]: Now they arrived at the base of a great knob or dome veneered with ice and powdered with snow -- the utmost , summit , the last bit of solidity between them and the hollow vault of heaven .
Parsing [sent. 4131 len. 51]: They set to work with their hatchets , and were soon creeping , insectlike , up its surface , with their heels projecting over the thinnest kind of nothingness , thickened up a little with a few wandering shreds and films of cloud moving in a lazy procession far below .
Parsing [sent. 4132 len. 11]: Presently , one man 's toe-hold broke and he fell !
Parsing [sent. 4133 len. 26]: There he dangled in mid-air at the end of the rope , like a spider , till his friends above hauled him into place again .
Parsing [sent. 4134 len. 40]: A little bit later , the party stood upon the wee pedestal of the very summit , in a driving wind , and looked out upon the vast green expanses of Italy and a shoreless ocean of billowy Alps .
Parsing [sent. 4135 len. 33]: When I had read thus far , Harris broke into the room in a noble excitement and said the ropes and the guides were secured , and asked if I was ready .
Parsing [sent. 4136 len. 13]: I said I believed I would n't ascend the Altels this time .
Parsing [sent. 4137 len. 35]: I said Alp-climbing was a different thing from what I had supposed it was , and so I judged we had better study its points a little more before we went definitely into it .
Parsing [sent. 4138 len. 25]: But I told him to retain the guides and order them to follow us to Zermatt , because I meant to use them there .
Parsing [sent. 4139 len. 30]: I said I could feel the spirit of adventure beginning to stir in me , and was sure that the fell fascination of Alp-climbing would soon be upon me .
Parsing [sent. 4140 len. 34]: I said he could make up his mind to it that we would do a deed before we were a week older which would make the hair of the timid curl with fright .
Parsing [sent. 4141 len. 12]: This made Harris happy , and filled him with ambitious anticipations .
Parsing [sent. 4142 len. 21]: He went at once to tell the guides to follow us to Zermatt and bring all their paraphernalia with them .
Parsing [sent. 4143 len. 17]: CHAPTER XXXV -LSB- Swindling the Coroner -RSB- A great and priceless thing is a new interest !
Parsing [sent. 4144 len. 8]: How it takes possession of a man !
Parsing [sent. 4145 len. 11]: how it clings to him , how it rides him !
Parsing [sent. 4146 len. 15]: I strode onward from the Schwarenbach hostelry a changed man , a reorganized personality .
Parsing [sent. 4147 len. 13]: I walked into a new world , I saw with new eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4148 len. 44]: I had been looking aloft at the giant show-peaks only as things to be worshiped for their grandeur and magnitude , and their unspeakable grace of form ; I looked up at them now , as also things to be conquered and climbed .
Parsing [sent. 4149 len. 30]: My sense of their grandeur and their noble beauty was neither lost nor impaired ; I had gained a new interest in the mountains without losing the old ones .
Parsing [sent. 4150 len. 28]: I followed the steep lines up , inch by inch , with my eye , and noted the possibility or impossibility of following them with my feet .
Parsing [sent. 4151 len. 33]: When I saw a shining helmet of ice projecting above the clouds , I tried to imagine I saw files of black specks toiling up it roped together with a gossamer thread .
Parsing [sent. 4152 len. 43]: We skirted the lonely little lake called the Daubensee , and presently passed close by a glacier on the right -- a thing like a great river frozen solid in its flow and broken square off like a wall at its mouth .
Parsing [sent. 4153 len. 10]: I had never been so near a glacier before .
Parsing [sent. 4154 len. 30]: Here we came upon a new board shanty , and found some men engaged in building a stone house ; so the Schwarenbach was soon to have a rival .
Parsing [sent. 4155 len. 46]: We bought a bottle or so of beer here ; at any rate they called it beer , but I knew by the price that it was dissolved jewelry , and I perceived by the taste that dissolved jewelry is not good stuff to drink .
Parsing [sent. 4156 len. 8]: We were surrounded by a hideous desolation .
Parsing [sent. 4157 len. 26]: We stepped forward to a sort of jumping-off place , and were confronted by a startling contrast : we seemed to look down into fairyland .
Parsing [sent. 4158 len. 69]: Two or three thousand feet below us was a bright green level , with a pretty town in its midst , and a silvery stream winding among the meadows ; the charming spot was walled in on all sides by gigantic precipices clothed with pines ; and over the pines , out of the softened distances , rose the snowy domes and peaks of the Monte Rosa region .
Parsing [sent. 4159 len. 12]: How exquisitely green and beautiful that little valley down there was !
Parsing [sent. 4160 len. 35]: The distance was not great enough to obliterate details , it only made them little , and mellow , and dainty , like landscapes and towns seen through the wrong end of a spy-glass .
Parsing [sent. 4161 len. 44]: Right under us a narrow ledge rose up out of the valley , with a green , slanting , bench-shaped top , and grouped about upon this green-baize bench were a lot of black and white sheep which looked merely like oversized worms .
Parsing [sent. 4162 len. 25]: The bench seemed lifted well up into our neighborhood , but that was a deception -- it was a long way down to it .
Parsing [sent. 4163 len. 17]: We began our descent , now , by the most remarkable road I have ever seen .
Parsing [sent. 4164 len. 34]: It wound its corkscrew curves down the face of the colossal precipice -- a narrow way , with always the solid rock wall at one elbow , and perpendicular nothingness at the other .
Parsing [sent. 4165 len. 41]: We met an everlasting procession of guides , porters , mules , litters , and tourists climbing up this steep and muddy path , and there was no room to spare when you had to pass a tolerably fat mule .
Parsing [sent. 4166 len. 22]: I always took the inside , when I heard or saw the mule coming , and flattened myself against the wall .
Parsing [sent. 4167 len. 25]: I preferred the inside , of course , but I should have had to take it anyhow , because the mule prefers the outside .
Parsing [sent. 4168 len. 16]: A mule 's preference -- on a precipice -- is a thing to be respected .
Parsing [sent. 4169 len. 9]: Well , his choice is always the outside .
Parsing [sent. 4170 len. 44]: His life is mostly devoted to carrying bulky panniers and packages which rest against his body -- therefore he is habituated to taking the outside edge of mountain paths , to keep his bundles from rubbing against rocks or banks on the other .
Parsing [sent. 4171 len. 46]: When he goes into the passenger business he absurdly clings to his old habit , and keeps one leg of his passenger always dangling over the great deeps of the lower world while that passenger 's heart is in the highlands , so to speak .
Parsing [sent. 4172 len. 44]: More than once I saw a mule 's hind foot cave over the outer edge and send earth and rubbish into the bottom abyss ; and I noticed that upon these occasions the rider , whether male or female , looked tolerably unwell .
Parsing [sent. 4173 len. 48]: There was one place where an eighteen-inch breadth of light masonry had been added to the verge of the path , and as there was a very sharp turn here , a panel of fencing had been set up there at some time , as a protection .
Parsing [sent. 4174 len. 20]: This panel was old and gray and feeble , and the light masonry had been loosened by recent rains .
Parsing [sent. 4175 len. 65]: A young American girl came along on a mule , and in making the turn the mule 's hind foot caved all the loose masonry and one of the fence-posts overboard ; the mule gave a violent lurch inboard to save himself , and succeeded in the effort , but that girl turned as white as the snows of Mont Blanc for a moment .
Parsing [sent. 4176 len. 100]: The path was simply a groove cut into the face of the precipice ; there was a four-foot breadth of solid rock under the traveler , and four-foot breadth of solid rock just above his head , like the roof of a narrow porch ; he could look out from this gallery and see a sheer summitless and bottomless wall of rock before him , across a gorge or crack a biscuit 's toss in width -- but he could not see the bottom of his own precipice unless he lay down and projected his nose over the edge .
Parsing [sent. 4177 len. 16]: I did not do this , because I did not wish to soil my clothes .
Parsing [sent. 4178 len. 53]: Every few hundred yards , at particularly bad places , one came across a panel or so of plank fencing ; but they were always old and weak , and they generally leaned out over the chasm and did not make any rash promises to hold up people who might need support .
Parsing [sent. 4179 len. 50]: There was one of these panels which had only its upper board left ; a pedestrianizing English youth came tearing down the path , was seized with an impulse to look over the precipice , and without an instant 's thought he threw his weight upon that crazy board .
Parsing [sent. 4180 len. 6]: It bent outward a foot !
Parsing [sent. 4181 len. 13]: I never made a gasp before that came so near suffocating me .
Parsing [sent. 4182 len. 15]: The English youth 's face simply showed a lively surprise , but nothing more .
Parsing [sent. 4183 len. 27]: He went swinging along valleyward again , as if he did not know he had just swindled a coroner by the closest kind of a shave .
Parsing [sent. 4184 len. 37]: The Alpine litter is sometimes like a cushioned box made fast between the middles of two long poles , and sometimes it is a chair with a back to it and a support for the feet .
Parsing [sent. 4185 len. 9]: It is carried by relays of strong porters .
Parsing [sent. 4186 len. 11]: The motion is easier than that of any other conveyance .
Parsing [sent. 4187 len. 43]: We met a few men and a great many ladies in litters ; it seemed to me that most of the ladies looked pale and nauseated ; their general aspect gave me the idea that they were patiently enduring a horrible suffering .
Parsing [sent. 4188 len. 20]: As a rule , they looked at their laps , and left the scenery to take care of itself .
Parsing [sent. 4189 len. 16]: But the most frightened creature I saw , was a led horse that overtook us .
Parsing [sent. 4190 len. 28]: Poor fellow , he had been born and reared in the grassy levels of the Kandersteg valley and had never seen anything like this hideous place before .
Parsing [sent. 4191 len. 51]: Every few steps he would stop short , glance wildly out from the dizzy height , and then spread his red nostrils wide and pant as violently as if he had been running a race ; and all the while he quaked from head to heel as with a palsy .
Parsing [sent. 4192 len. 26]: He was a handsome fellow , and he made a fine statuesque picture of terror , but it was pitiful to see him suffer so .
Parsing [sent. 4193 len. 8]: This dreadful path has had its tragedy .
Parsing [sent. 4194 len. 24]: Baedeker , with his customary over terseness , begins and ends the tale thus : `` The descent on horseback should be avoided .
Parsing [sent. 4195 len. 20]: In 1861 a Comtesse d'Herlincourt fell from her saddle over the precipice and was killed on the spot . ''
Parsing [sent. 4196 len. 16]: We looked over the precipice there , and saw the monument which commemorates the event .
Parsing [sent. 4197 len. 30]: It stands in the bottom of the gorge , in a place which has been hollowed out of the rock to protect it from the torrent and the storms .
Parsing [sent. 4198 len. 37]: Our old guide never spoke but when spoken to , and then limited himself to a syllable or two , but when we asked him about this tragedy he showed a strong interest in the matter .
Parsing [sent. 4199 len. 21]: He said the Countess was very pretty , and very young -- hardly out of her girlhood , in fact .
Parsing [sent. 4200 len. 12]: She was newly married , and was on her bridal tour .
Parsing [sent. 4201 len. 26]: The young husband was riding a little in advance ; one guide was leading the husband 's horse , another was leading the bride 's .
Parsing [sent. 4202 len. 101]: The old man continued : `` The guide that was leading the husband 's horse happened to glance back , and there was that poor young thing sitting up staring out over the precipice ; and her face began to bend downward a little , and she put up her two hands slowly and met it -- so , -- and put them flat against her eyes -- so -- and then she sank out of the saddle , with a sharp shriek , and one caught only the flash of a dress , and it was all over . ''
Parsing [sent. 4203 len. 23]: Then after a pause : `` Ah , yes , that guide saw these things -- yes , he saw them all .
Parsing [sent. 4204 len. 13]: He saw them all , just as I have told you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4205 len. 14]: After another pause : `` Ah , yes , he saw them all .
Parsing [sent. 4206 len. 7]: My God , that was ME .
Parsing [sent. 4207 len. 6]: I was that guide ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4208 len. 27]: This had been the one event of the old man 's life ; so one may be sure he had forgotten no detail connected with it .
Parsing [sent. 4209 len. 31]: We listened to all he had to say about what was done and what happened and what was said after the sorrowful occurrence , and a painful story it was .
Parsing [sent. 4210 len. 67]: When we had wound down toward the valley until we were about on the last spiral of the corkscrew , Harris 's hat blew over the last remaining bit of precipice -- a small cliff a hundred or hundred and fifty feet high -- and sailed down toward a steep slant composed of rough chips and fragments which the weather had flaked away from the precipices .
Parsing [sent. 4211 len. 25]: We went leisurely down there , expecting to find it without any trouble , but we had made a mistake , as to that .
Parsing [sent. 4212 len. 47]: We hunted during a couple of hours -- not because the old straw hat was valuable , but out of curiosity to find out how such a thing could manage to conceal itself in open ground where there was nothing left for it to hide behind .
Parsing [sent. 4213 len. 94]: When one is reading in bed , and lays his paper-knife down , he can not find it again if it is smaller than a saber ; that hat was as stubborn as any paper-knife could have been , and we finally had to give it up ; but we found a fragment that had once belonged to an opera-glass , and by digging around and turning over the rocks we gradually collected all the lenses and the cylinders and the various odds and ends that go to making up a complete opera-glass .
Parsing [sent. 4214 len. 24]: We afterward had the thing reconstructed , and the owner can have his adventurous lost-property by submitting proofs and paying costs of rehabilitation .
Parsing [sent. 4215 len. 29]: We had hopes of finding the owner there , distributed around amongst the rocks , for it would have made an elegant paragraph ; but we were disappointed .
Parsing [sent. 4216 len. 48]: Still , we were far from being disheartened , for there was a considerable area which we had not thoroughly searched ; we were satisfied he was there , somewhere , so we resolved to wait over a day at Leuk and come back and get him .
Parsing [sent. 4217 len. 23]: Then we sat down to polish off the perspiration and arrange about what we would do with him when we got him .
Parsing [sent. 4218 len. 20]: Harris was for contributing him to the British Museum ; but I was for mailing him to his widow .
Parsing [sent. 4219 len. 31]: That is the difference between Harris and me : Harris is all for display , I am all for the simple right , even though I lose money by it .
Parsing [sent. 4220 len. 20]: Harris argued in favor of his proposition against mine , I argued in favor of mine and against his .
Parsing [sent. 4221 len. 14]: The discussion warmed into a dispute ; the dispute warmed into a quarrel .
Parsing [sent. 4222 len. 14]: I finally said , very decidedly : `` My mind is made up .
Parsing [sent. 4223 len. 7]: He goes to the widow . ''
Parsing [sent. 4224 len. 12]: Harris answered sharply : `` And MY mind is made up .
Parsing [sent. 4225 len. 7]: He goes to the Museum . ''
Parsing [sent. 4226 len. 16]: I said , calmly : `` The museum may whistle when it gets him . ''
Parsing [sent. 4227 len. 25]: Harris retorted : `` The widow may save herself the trouble of whistling , for I will see that she never gets him . ''
Parsing [sent. 4228 len. 28]: After some angry bandying of epithets , I said : `` It seems to me that you are taking on a good many airs about these remains .
Parsing [sent. 4229 len. 15]: I do n't quite see what YOU 'VE got to say about them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4230 len. 3]: `` I ?
Parsing [sent. 4231 len. 9]: I 've got ALL to say about them .
Parsing [sent. 4232 len. 15]: They 'd never have been thought of if I had n't found their opera-glass .
Parsing [sent. 4233 len. 17]: The corpse belongs to me , and I 'll do as I please with him . ''
Parsing [sent. 4234 len. 18]: I was leader of the Expedition , and all discoveries achieved by it naturally belonged to me .
Parsing [sent. 4235 len. 33]: I was entitled to these remains , and could have enforced my right ; but rather than have bad blood about the matter , I said we would toss up for them .
Parsing [sent. 4236 len. 29]: I threw heads and won , but it was a barren victory , for although we spent all the next day searching , we never found a bone .
Parsing [sent. 4237 len. 13]: I can not imagine what could ever have become of that fellow .
Parsing [sent. 4238 len. 11]: The town in the valley is called Leuk or Leukerbad .
Parsing [sent. 4239 len. 44]: We pointed our course toward it , down a verdant slope which was adorned with fringed gentians and other flowers , and presently entered the narrow alleys of the outskirts and waded toward the middle of the town through liquid `` fertilizer . ''
Parsing [sent. 4240 len. 12]: They ought to either pave that village or organize a ferry .
Parsing [sent. 4241 len. 64]: Harris 's body was simply a chamois-pasture ; his person was populous with the little hungry pests ; his skin , when he stripped , was splotched like a scarlet-fever patient 's ; so , when we were about to enter one of the Leukerbad inns , and he noticed its sign , `` Chamois Hotel , '' he refused to stop there .
Parsing [sent. 4242 len. 20]: He said the chamois was plentiful enough , without hunting up hotels where they made a specialty of it .
Parsing [sent. 4243 len. 33]: I was indifferent , for the chamois is a creature that will neither bite me nor abide with me ; but to calm Harris , we went to the Hôtel des Alpes .
Parsing [sent. 4244 len. 13]: At the table d'hôte , we had this , for an incident .
Parsing [sent. 4245 len. 36]: A very grave man -- in fact his gravity amounted to solemnity , and almost to austerity -- sat opposite us and he was `` tight , '' but doing his best to appear sober .
Parsing [sent. 4246 len. 36]: He took up a CORKED bottle of wine , tilted it over his glass awhile , then set it out of the way , with a contented look , and went on with his dinner .
Parsing [sent. 4247 len. 16]: Presently he put his glass to his mouth , and of course found it empty .
Parsing [sent. 4248 len. 29]: He looked puzzled , and glanced furtively and suspiciously out of the corner of his eye at a benignant and unconscious old lady who sat at his right .
Parsing [sent. 4249 len. 21]: Shook his head , as much as to say , `` No , she could n't have done it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4250 len. 25]: He tilted the corked bottle over his glass again , meantime searching around with his watery eye to see if anybody was watching him .
Parsing [sent. 4251 len. 21]: He ate a few mouthfuls , raised his glass to his lips , and of course it was still empty .
Parsing [sent. 4252 len. 20]: He bent an injured and accusing side-glance upon that unconscious old lady , which was a study to see .
Parsing [sent. 4253 len. 9]: She went on eating and gave no sign .
Parsing [sent. 4254 len. 63]: He took up his glass and his bottle , with a wise private nod of his head , and set them gravely on the left-hand side of his plate -- poured himself another imaginary drink -- went to work with his knife and fork once more -- presently lifted his glass with good confidence , and found it empty , as usual .
Parsing [sent. 4255 len. 7]: This was almost a petrifying surprise .
Parsing [sent. 4256 len. 27]: He straightened himself up in his chair and deliberately and sorrowfully inspected the busy old ladies at his elbows , first one and then the other .
Parsing [sent. 4257 len. 35]: At last he softly pushed his plate away , set his glass directly in front of him , held on to it with his left hand , and proceeded to pour with his right .
Parsing [sent. 4258 len. 8]: This time he observed that nothing came .
Parsing [sent. 4259 len. 35]: He turned the bottle clear upside down ; still nothing issued from it ; a plaintive look came into his face , and he said , as if to himself , '' ` IC !
Parsing [sent. 4260 len. 7]: THEY 'VE GOT IT ALL ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4261 len. 18]: Then he set the bottle down , resignedly , and took the rest of his dinner dry .
Parsing [sent. 4262 len. 25]: It was at that table d'hôte , too , that I had under inspection the largest lady I have ever seen in private life .
Parsing [sent. 4263 len. 11]: She was over seven feet high , and magnificently proportioned .
Parsing [sent. 4264 len. 43]: What had first called my attention to her , was my stepping on an outlying flange of her foot , and hearing , from up toward the ceiling , a deep `` Pardon , m ` sieu , but you encroach ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4265 len. 24]: That was when we were coming through the hall , and the place was dim , and I could see her only vaguely .
Parsing [sent. 4266 len. 44]: The thing which called my attention to her the second time was , that at a table beyond ours were two very pretty girls , and this great lady came in and sat down between them and me and blotted out my view .
Parsing [sent. 4267 len. 20]: She had a handsome face , and she was very finely formed -- perfectly formed , I should say .
Parsing [sent. 4268 len. 11]: But she made everybody around her look trivial and commonplace .
Parsing [sent. 4269 len. 15]: Ladies near her looked like children , and the men about her looked mean .
Parsing [sent. 4270 len. 16]: They looked like failures ; and they looked as if they felt so , too .
Parsing [sent. 4271 len. 8]: She sat with her back to us .
Parsing [sent. 4272 len. 10]: I never saw such a back in my life .
Parsing [sent. 4273 len. 13]: I would have so liked to see the moon rise over it .
Parsing [sent. 4274 len. 37]: The whole congregation waited , under one pretext or another , till she finished her dinner and went out ; they wanted to see her at full altitude , and they found it worth tarrying for .
Parsing [sent. 4275 len. 29]: She filled one 's idea of what an empress ought to be , when she rose up in her unapproachable grandeur and moved superbly out of that place .
Parsing [sent. 4276 len. 15]: We were not at Leuk in time to see her at her heaviest weight .
Parsing [sent. 4277 len. 20]: She had suffered from corpulence and had come there to get rid of her extra flesh in the baths .
Parsing [sent. 4278 len. 25]: Five weeks of soaking -- five uninterrupted hours of it every day -- had accomplished her purpose and reduced her to the right proportions .
Parsing [sent. 4279 len. 9]: Those baths remove fat , and also skin-diseases .
Parsing [sent. 4280 len. 13]: The patients remain in the great tanks for hours at a time .
Parsing [sent. 4281 len. 19]: A dozen gentlemen and ladies occupy a tank together , and amuse themselves with rompings and various games .
Parsing [sent. 4282 len. 21]: They have floating desks and tables , and they read or lunch or play chess in water that is breast-deep .
Parsing [sent. 4283 len. 14]: The tourist can step in and view this novel spectacle if he chooses .
Parsing [sent. 4284 len. 12]: There 's a poor-box , and he will have to contribute .
Parsing [sent. 4285 len. 33]: There are several of these big bathing-houses , and you can always tell when you are near one of them by the romping noises and shouts of laughter that proceed from it .
Parsing [sent. 4286 len. 45]: The water is running water , and changes all the time , else a patient with a ringworm might take the bath with only a partial success , since , while he was ridding himself of the ringworm , he might catch the itch .
Parsing [sent. 4287 len. 30]: The next morning we wandered back up the green valley , leisurely , with the curving walls of those bare and stupendous precipices rising into the clouds before us .
Parsing [sent. 4288 len. 28]: I had never seen a clean , bare precipice stretching up five thousand feet above me before , and I never shall expect to see another one .
Parsing [sent. 4289 len. 18]: They exist , perhaps , but not in places where one can easily get close to them .
Parsing [sent. 4290 len. 7]: This pile of stone is peculiar .
Parsing [sent. 4291 len. 24]: From its base to the soaring tops of its mighty towers , all its lines and all its details vaguely suggest human architecture .
Parsing [sent. 4292 len. 15]: There are rudimentary bow-windows , cornices , chimneys , demarcations of stories , etc. .
Parsing [sent. 4293 len. 34]: One could sit and stare up there and study the features and exquisite graces of this grand structure , bit by bit , and day after day , and never weary his interest .
Parsing [sent. 4294 len. 17]: The termination , toward the town , observed in profile , is the perfection of shape .
Parsing [sent. 4295 len. 50]: It comes down out of the clouds in a succession of rounded , colossal , terracelike projections -- a stairway for the gods ; at its head spring several lofty storm-scarred towers , one after another , with faint films of vapor curling always about them like spectral banners .
Parsing [sent. 4296 len. 25]: If there were a king whose realms included the whole world , here would be the place meet and proper for such a monarch .
Parsing [sent. 4297 len. 15]: He would only need to hollow it out and put in the electric light .
Parsing [sent. 4298 len. 14]: He could give audience to a nation at a time under its roof .
Parsing [sent. 4299 len. 61]: Our search for those remains having failed , we inspected with a glass the dim and distant track of an old-time avalanche that once swept down from some pine-grown summits behind the town and swept away the houses and buried the people ; then we struck down the road that leads toward the Rhone , to see the famous Ladders .
Parsing [sent. 4300 len. 19]: These perilous things are built against the perpendicular face of a cliff two or three hundred feet high .
Parsing [sent. 4301 len. 21]: The peasants , of both sexes , were climbing up and down them , with heavy loads on their backs .
Parsing [sent. 4302 len. 41]: I ordered Harris to make the ascent , so I could put the thrill and horror of it in my book , and he accomplished the feat successfully , through a subagent , for three francs , which I paid .
Parsing [sent. 4303 len. 28]: It makes me shudder yet when I think of what I felt when I was clinging there between heaven and earth in the person of that proxy .
Parsing [sent. 4304 len. 24]: At times the world swam around me , and I could hardly keep from letting go , so dizzying was the appalling danger .
Parsing [sent. 4305 len. 27]: Many a person would have given up and descended , but I stuck to my task , and would not yield until I had accomplished it .
Parsing [sent. 4306 len. 23]: I felt a just pride in my exploit , but I would not have repeated it for the wealth of the world .
Parsing [sent. 4307 len. 24]: I shall break my neck yet with some such foolhardy performance , for warnings never seem to have any lasting effect on me .
Parsing [sent. 4308 len. 25]: When the people of the hotel found that I had been climbing those crazy Ladders , it made me an object of considerable attention .
Parsing [sent. 4309 len. 18]: Next morning , early , we drove to the Rhone valley and took the train for Visp .
Parsing [sent. 4310 len. 27]: There we shouldered our knapsacks and things , and set out on foot , in a tremendous rain , up the winding gorge , toward Zermatt .
Parsing [sent. 4311 len. 43]: Hour after hour we slopped along , by the roaring torrent , and under noble Lesser Alps which were clothed in rich velvety green all the way up and had little atomy Swiss homes perched upon grassy benches along their mist-dimmed heights .
Parsing [sent. 4312 len. 18]: The rain continued to pour and the torrent to boom , and we continued to enjoy both .
Parsing [sent. 4313 len. 43]: At the one spot where this torrent tossed its white mane highest , and thundered loudest , and lashed the big boulders fiercest , the canton had done itself the honor to build the flimsiest wooden bridge that exists in the world .
Parsing [sent. 4314 len. 25]: While we were walking over it , along with a party of horsemen , I noticed that even the larger raindrops made it shake .
Parsing [sent. 4315 len. 15]: I called Harris 's attention to it , and he noticed it , too .
Parsing [sent. 4316 len. 37]: It seemed to me that if I owned an elephant that was a keepsake , and I thought a good deal of him , I would think twice before I would ride him over that bridge .
Parsing [sent. 4317 len. 38]: We climbed up to the village of St. Nicholas , about half past four in the afternoon , waded ankle-deep through the fertilizer-juice , and stopped at a new and nice hotel close by the little church .
Parsing [sent. 4318 len. 16]: We stripped and went to bed , and sent our clothes down to be baked .
Parsing [sent. 4319 len. 10]: And the horde of soaked tourists did the same .
Parsing [sent. 4320 len. 15]: That chaos of clothing got mixed in the kitchen , and there were consequences .
Parsing [sent. 4321 len. 29]: I did not get back the same drawers I sent down , when our things came up at six-fifteen ; I got a pair on a new plan .
Parsing [sent. 4322 len. 31]: They were merely a pair of white ruffle-cuffed absurdities , hitched together at the top with a narrow band , and they did not come quite down to my knees .
Parsing [sent. 4323 len. 19]: They were pretty enough , but they made me feel like two people , and disconnected at that .
Parsing [sent. 4324 len. 22]: The man must have been an idiot that got himself up like that , to rough it in the Swiss mountains .
Parsing [sent. 4325 len. 52]: The shirt they brought me was shorter than the drawers , and had n't any sleeves to it -- at least it had n't anything more than what Mr. Darwin would call `` rudimentary '' sleeves ; these had `` edging '' around them , but the bosom was ridiculously plain .
Parsing [sent. 4326 len. 55]: The knit silk undershirt they brought me was on a new plan , and was really a sensible thing ; it opened behind , and had pockets in it to put your shoulder-blades in ; but they did not seem to fit mine , and so I found it a sort of uncomfortable garment .
Parsing [sent. 4327 len. 19]: They gave my bobtail coat to somebody else , and sent me an ulster suitable for a giraffe .
Parsing [sent. 4328 len. 26]: I had to tie my collar on , because there was no button behind on that foolish little shirt which I described a while ago .
Parsing [sent. 4329 len. 30]: When I was dressed for dinner at six-thirty , I was too loose in some places and too tight in others , and altogether I felt slovenly and ill-conditioned .
Parsing [sent. 4330 len. 26]: However , the people at the table d'hôte were no better off than I was ; they had everybody 's clothes but their own on .
Parsing [sent. 4331 len. 39]: A long stranger recognized his ulster as soon as he saw the tail of it following me in , but nobody claimed my shirt or my drawers , though I described them as well as I was able .
Parsing [sent. 4332 len. 36]: I gave them to the chambermaid that night when I went to bed , and she probably found the owner , for my own things were on a chair outside my door in the morning .
Parsing [sent. 4333 len. 17]: There was a lovable English clergyman who did not get to the table d'hôte at all .
Parsing [sent. 4334 len. 12]: His breeches had turned up missing , and without any equivalent .
Parsing [sent. 4335 len. 30]: He said he was not more particular than other people , but he had noticed that a clergyman at dinner without any breeches was almost sure to excite remark .

Parsing [sent. 4392 len. 40]: The church-bell began to ring at four-thirty in the morning , and from the length of time it continued to ring I judged that it takes the Swiss sinner a good while to get the invitation through his head .
Parsing [sent. 4393 len. 52]: Most church-bells in the world are of poor quality , and have a harsh and rasping sound which upsets the temper and produces much sin , but the St. Nicholas bell is a good deal the worst one that has been contrived yet , and is peculiarly maddening in its operation .
Parsing [sent. 4394 len. 74]: Still , it may have its right and its excuse to exist , for the community is poor and not every citizen can afford a clock , perhaps ; but there can not be any excuse for our church-bells at home , for there is no family in America without a clock , and consequently there is no fair pretext for the usual Sunday medley of dreadful sounds that issues from our steeples .
Parsing [sent. 4395 len. 40]: There is much more profanity in America on Sunday than in all in the other six days of the week put together , and it is of a more bitter and malignant character than the week-day profanity , too .
Parsing [sent. 4396 len. 12]: It is produced by the cracked-pot clangor of the cheap church-bells .
Parsing [sent. 4397 len. 82]: We build our churches almost without regard to cost ; we rear an edifice which is an adornment to the town , and we gild it , and fresco it , and mortgage it , and do everything we can think of to perfect it , and then spoil it all by putting a bell on it which afflicts everybody who hears it , giving some the headache , others St. Vitus 's dance , and the rest the blind staggers .
Parsing [sent. 4398 len. 33]: An American village at ten o'clock on a summer Sunday is the quietest and peacefulest and holiest thing in nature ; but it is a pretty different thing half an hour later .
Parsing [sent. 4399 len. 71]: Mr. Poe 's poem of the `` Bells '' stands incomplete to this day ; but it is well enough that it is so , for the public reciter or `` reader '' who goes around trying to imitate the sounds of the various sorts of bells with his voice would find himself `` up a stump '' when he got to the church-bell -- as Joseph Addison would say .
Parsing [sent. 4400 len. 30]: The church is always trying to get other people to reform ; it might not be a bad idea to reform itself a little , by way of example .
Parsing [sent. 4401 len. 26]: It is still clinging to one or two things which were useful once , but which are not useful now , neither are they ornamental .
Parsing [sent. 4402 len. 42]: One is the bell-ringing to remind a clock-caked town that it is church-time , and another is the reading from the pulpit of a tedious list of `` notices '' which everybody who is interested has already read in the newspaper .
Parsing [sent. 4403 len. 39]: The clergyman even reads the hymn through -- a relic of an ancient time when hymn-books are scarce and costly ; but everybody has a hymn-book , now , and so the public reading is no longer necessary .
Parsing [sent. 4404 len. 38]: It is not merely unnecessary , it is generally painful ; for the average clergyman could not fire into his congregation with a shotgun and hit a worse reader than himself , unless the weapon scattered shamefully .
Parsing [sent. 4405 len. 18]: I am not meaning to be flippant and irreverent , I am only meaning to be truthful .
Parsing [sent. 4406 len. 18]: The average clergyman , in all countries and of all denominations , is a very bad reader .
Parsing [sent. 4407 len. 26]: One would think he would at least learn how to read the Lord 's Prayer , by and by , but it is not so .
Parsing [sent. 4408 len. 22]: He races through it as if he thought the quicker he got it in , the sooner it would be answered .
Parsing [sent. 4409 len. 38]: A person who does not appreciate the exceeding value of pauses , and does not know how to measure their duration judiciously , can not render the grand simplicity and dignity of a composition like that effectively .
Parsing [sent. 4410 len. 28]: We took a tolerably early breakfast , and tramped off toward Zermatt through the reeking lanes of the village , glad to get away from that bell .
Parsing [sent. 4411 len. 12]: By and by we had a fine spectacle on our right .
Parsing [sent. 4412 len. 29]: It was the wall-like butt end of a huge glacier , which looked down on us from an Alpine height which was well up in the blue sky .
Parsing [sent. 4413 len. 15]: It was an astonishing amount of ice to be compacted together in one mass .
Parsing [sent. 4414 len. 38]: We ciphered upon it and decided that it was not less than several hundred feet from the base of the wall of solid ice to the top of it -- Harris believed it was really twice that .
Parsing [sent. 4415 len. 71]: We judged that if St. Paul 's , St. Peter 's , the Great Pyramid , the Strasburg Cathedral and the Capitol in Washington were clustered against that wall , a man sitting on its upper edge could not hang his hat on the top of any one of them without reaching down three or four hundred feet -- a thing which , of course , no man could do .
Parsing [sent. 4416 len. 10]: To me , that mighty glacier was very beautiful .
Parsing [sent. 4417 len. 17]: I did not imagine that anybody could find fault with it ; but I was mistaken .
Parsing [sent. 4418 len. 8]: Harris had been snarling for several days .
Parsing [sent. 4419 len. 88]: He was a rabid Protestant , and he was always saying : `` In the Protestant cantons you never see such poverty and dirt and squalor as you do in this Catholic one ; you never see the lanes and alleys flowing with foulness ; you never see such wretched little sties of houses ; you never see an inverted tin turnip on top of a church for a dome ; and as for a church-bell , why , you never hear a church-bell at all . ''
Parsing [sent. 4420 len. 12]: All this morning he had been finding fault , straight along .
Parsing [sent. 4421 len. 7]: First it was with the mud .
Parsing [sent. 4422 len. 17]: He said , `` It ai n't muddy in a Protestant canton when it rains . ''
Parsing [sent. 4423 len. 21]: Then it was with the dogs : `` They do n't have those lop-eared dogs in a Protestant canton . ''
Parsing [sent. 4424 len. 40]: Then it was with the roads : `` They do n't leave the roads to make themselves in a Protestant canton , the people make them -- and they make a road that IS a road , too . ''
Parsing [sent. 4425 len. 34]: Next it was the goats : `` You never see a goat shedding tears in a Protestant canton -- a goat , there , is one of the cheerfulest objects in nature . ''
Parsing [sent. 4426 len. 38]: Next it was the chamois : `` You never see a Protestant chamois act like one of these -- they take a bite or two and go ; but these fellows camp with you and stay . ''
Parsing [sent. 4427 len. 33]: Then it was the guide-boards : `` In a Protestant canton you could n't get lost if you wanted to , but you never see a guide-board in a Catholic canton . ''
Parsing [sent. 4428 len. 52]: Next , `` You never see any flower-boxes in the windows , here -- never anything but now and then a cat -- a torpid one ; but you take a Protestant canton : windows perfectly lovely with flowers -- and as for cats , there 's just acres of them .
Parsing [sent. 4429 len. 41]: These folks in this canton leave a road to make itself , and then fine you three francs if you ` trot ' over it -- as if a horse could trot over such a sarcasm of a road . ''
Parsing [sent. 4430 len. 11]: Next about the goiter : `` THEY talk about goiter !
Parsing [sent. 4431 len. 21]: -- I have n't seen a goiter in this whole canton that I could n't put in a hat . ''
Parsing [sent. 4432 len. 23]: He had growled at everything , but I judged it would puzzle him to find anything the matter with this majestic glacier .
Parsing [sent. 4433 len. 28]: I intimated as much ; but he was ready , and said with surly discontent : `` You ought to see them in the Protestant cantons . ''
Parsing [sent. 4434 len. 4]: This irritated me .
Parsing [sent. 4435 len. 19]: But I concealed the feeling , and asked : `` What is the matter with this one ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4436 len. 3]: `` Matter ?
Parsing [sent. 4437 len. 11]: Why , it ai n't in any kind of condition .
Parsing [sent. 4438 len. 10]: They never take any care of a glacier here .
Parsing [sent. 4439 len. 16]: The moraine has been spilling gravel around it , and got it all dirty . ''
Parsing [sent. 4440 len. 12]: `` Why , man , THEY ca n't help that . ''
Parsing [sent. 4441 len. 3]: `` THEY ?
Parsing [sent. 4442 len. 4]: You 're right .
Parsing [sent. 4443 len. 7]: That is , they WO N'T .
Parsing [sent. 4444 len. 7]: They could if they wanted to .
Parsing [sent. 4445 len. 12]: You never see a speck of dirt on a Protestant glacier .
Parsing [sent. 4446 len. 6]: Look at the Rhone glacier .
Parsing [sent. 4447 len. 12]: It is fifteen miles long , and seven hundred feet thick .
Parsing [sent. 4448 len. 21]: If this was a Protestant glacier you would n't see it looking like this , I can tell you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4449 len. 5]: `` That is nonsense .
Parsing [sent. 4450 len. 8]: What would they do with it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4451 len. 6]: `` They would whitewash it .
Parsing [sent. 4452 len. 5]: They always do . ''
Parsing [sent. 4453 len. 32]: I did not believe a word of this , but rather than have trouble I let it go ; for it is a waste of breath to argue with a bigot .
Parsing [sent. 4454 len. 41]: I even doubted if the Rhone glacier WAS in a Protestant canton ; but I did not know , so I could not make anything by contradicting a man who would probably put me down at once with manufactured evidence .
Parsing [sent. 4455 len. 47]: About nine miles from St. Nicholas we crossed a bridge over the raging torrent of the Visp , and came to a log strip of flimsy fencing which was pretending to secure people from tumbling over a perpendicular wall forty feet high and into the river .
Parsing [sent. 4456 len. 50]: Three children were approaching ; one of them , a little girl , about eight years old , was running ; when pretty close to us she stumbled and fell , and her feet shot under the rail of the fence and for a moment projected over the stream .
Parsing [sent. 4457 len. 44]: It gave us a sharp shock , for we thought she was gone , sure , for the ground slanted steeply , and to save herself seemed a sheer impossibility ; but she managed to scramble up , and ran by us laughing .
Parsing [sent. 4458 len. 27]: We went forward and examined the place and saw the long tracks which her feet had made in the dirt when they darted over the verge .
Parsing [sent. 4459 len. 45]: If she had finished her trip she would have struck some big rocks in the edge of the water , and then the torrent would have snatched her downstream among the half-covered boulders and she would have been pounded to pulp in two minutes .
Parsing [sent. 4460 len. 9]: We had come exceedingly near witnessing her death .
Parsing [sent. 4461 len. 13]: And now Harris 's contrary nature and inborn selfishness were strikingly manifested .
Parsing [sent. 4462 len. 7]: He has no spirit of self-denial .
Parsing [sent. 4463 len. 22]: He began straight off , and continued for an hour , to express his gratitude that the child was not destroyed .
Parsing [sent. 4464 len. 7]: I never saw such a man .
Parsing [sent. 4465 len. 23]: That was the kind of person he was ; just so HE was gratified , he never cared anything about anybody else .
Parsing [sent. 4466 len. 13]: I had noticed that trait in him , over and over again .
Parsing [sent. 4467 len. 15]: Often , of course , it was mere heedlessness , mere want of reflection .
Parsing [sent. 4468 len. 37]: Doubtless this may have been the case in most instances , but it was not the less hard to bar on that account -- and after all , its bottom , its groundwork , was selfishness .
Parsing [sent. 4469 len. 7]: There is no avoiding that conclusion .
Parsing [sent. 4470 len. 72]: In the instance under consideration , I did think the indecency of running on in that way might occur to him ; but no , the child was saved and he was glad , that was sufficient -- he cared not a straw for MY feelings , or my loss of such a literary plum , snatched from my very mouth at the instant it was ready to drop into it .
Parsing [sent. 4471 len. 23]: His selfishness was sufficient to place his own gratification in being spared suffering clear before all concern for me , his friend .
Parsing [sent. 4472 len. 68]: Apparently , he did not once reflect upon the valuable details which would have fallen like a windfall to me : fishing the child out -- witnessing the surprise of the family and the stir the thing would have made among the peasants -- then a Swiss funeral -- then the roadside monument , to be paid for by us and have our names mentioned in it .
Parsing [sent. 4473 len. 11]: And we should have gone into Baedeker and been immortal .
Parsing [sent. 4474 len. 4]: I was silent .
Parsing [sent. 4475 len. 8]: I was too much hurt to complain .
Parsing [sent. 4476 len. 52]: If he could act so , and be so heedless and so frivolous at such a time , and actually seem to glory in it , after all I had done for him , I would have cut my hand off before I would let him see that I was wounded .
Parsing [sent. 4477 len. 14]: We were approaching Zermatt ; consequently , we were approaching the renowned Matterhorn .
Parsing [sent. 4478 len. 75]: A month before , this mountain had been only a name to us , but latterly we had been moving through a steadily thickening double row of pictures of it , done in oil , water , chromo , wood , steel , copper , crayon , and photography , and so it had at length become a shape to us -- and a very distinct , decided , and familiar one , too .
Parsing [sent. 4479 len. 16]: We were expecting to recognize that mountain whenever or wherever we should run across it .
Parsing [sent. 4480 len. 5]: We were not deceived .
Parsing [sent. 4481 len. 21]: The monarch was far away when we first saw him , but there was no such thing as mistaking him .
Parsing [sent. 4482 len. 24]: He has the rare peculiarity of standing by himself ; he is peculiarly steep , too , and is also most oddly shaped .
Parsing [sent. 4483 len. 24]: He towers into the sky like a colossal wedge , with the upper third of its blade bent a little to the left .
Parsing [sent. 4484 len. 48]: The broad base of this monster wedge is planted upon a grand glacier-paved Alpine platform whose elevation is ten thousand feet above sea-level ; as the wedge itself is some five thousand feet high , it follows that its apex is about fifteen thousand feet above sea-level .
Parsing [sent. 4485 len. 23]: So the whole bulk of this stately piece of rock , this sky-cleaving monolith , is above the line of eternal snow .
Parsing [sent. 4486 len. 58]: Yet while all its giant neighbors have the look of being built of solid snow , from their waists up , the Matterhorn stands black and naked and forbidding , the year round , or merely powdered or streaked with white in places , for its sides are so steep that the snow can not stay there .
Parsing [sent. 4487 len. 31]: Its strange form , its august isolation , and its majestic unkinship with its own kind , make it -- so to speak -- the Napoleon of the mountain world .
Parsing [sent. 4488 len. 24]: `` Grand , gloomy , and peculiar , '' is a phrase which fits it as aptly as it fitted the great captain .
Parsing [sent. 4489 len. 16]: Think of a monument a mile high , standing on a pedestal two miles high !
Parsing [sent. 4490 len. 10]: This is what the Matterhorn is -- a monument .
Parsing [sent. 4491 len. 49]: Its office , henceforth , for all time , will be to keep watch and ward over the secret resting-place of the young Lord Douglas , who , in 1865 , was precipitated from the summit over a precipice four thousand feet high , and never seen again .
Parsing [sent. 4492 len. 45]: No man ever had such a monument as this before ; the most imposing of the world 's other monuments are but atoms compared to it ; and they will perish , and their places will pass from memory , but this will remain .
Parsing [sent. 4493 len. 23]: -LSB- The accident which cost Lord Douglas his life -LRB- see Chapter xii -RRB- also cost the lives of three other men .
Parsing [sent. 4494 len. 36]: These three fell four-fifths of a mile , and their bodies were afterward found , lying side by side , upon a glacier , whence they were borne to Zermatt and buried in the churchyard .
Parsing [sent. 4495 len. 10]: The remains of Lord Douglas have never been found .
Parsing [sent. 4496 len. 18]: The secret of his sepulture , like that of Moses , must remain a mystery always . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 4497 len. 12]: A walk from St. Nicholas to Zermatt is a wonderful experience .
Parsing [sent. 4498 len. 11]: Nature is built on a stupendous plan in that region .
Parsing [sent. 4499 len. 65]: One marches continually between walls that are piled into the skies , with their upper heights broken into a confusion of sublime shapes that gleam white and cold against the background of blue ; and here and there one sees a big glacier displaying its grandeurs on the top of a precipice , or a graceful cascade leaping and flashing down the green declivities .
Parsing [sent. 4500 len. 16]: There is nothing tame , or cheap , or trivial -- it is all magnificent .
Parsing [sent. 4501 len. 30]: That short valley is a picture-gallery of a notable kind , for it contains no mediocrities ; from end to end the Creator has hung it with His masterpieces .
Parsing [sent. 4502 len. 16]: We made Zermatt at three in the afternoon , nine hours out from St. Nicholas .
Parsing [sent. 4503 len. 12]: Distance , by guide-book , twelve miles ; by pedometer seventy-two .
Parsing [sent. 4504 len. 19]: We were in the heart and home of the mountain-climbers , now , as all visible things testified .
Parsing [sent. 4505 len. 142]: The snow-peaks did not hold themselves aloof , in aristocratic reserve ; they nestled close around , in a friendly , sociable way ; guides , with the ropes and axes and other implements of their fearful calling slung about their persons , roosted in a long line upon a stone wall in front of the hotel , and waited for customers ; sun-burnt climbers , in mountaineering costume , and followed by their guides and porters , arrived from time to time , from breakneck expeditions among the peaks and glaciers of the High Alps ; male and female tourists , on mules , filed by , in a continuous procession , hotelward-bound from wild adventures which would grow in grandeur every time they were described at the English or American fireside , and at last outgrow the possible itself .
Parsing [sent. 4506 len. 47]: We were not dreaming ; this was not a make-believe home of the Alp-climber , created by our heated imaginations ; no , for here was Mr. Girdlestone himself , the famous Englishman who hunts his way to the most formidable Alpine summits without a guide .
Parsing [sent. 4507 len. 29]: I was not equal to imagining a Girdlestone ; it was all I could do to even realize him , while looking straight at him at short range .
Parsing [sent. 4508 len. 28]: I would rather face whole Hyde Parks of artillery than the ghastly forms of death which he has faced among the peaks and precipices of the mountains .
Parsing [sent. 4509 len. 33]: There is probably no pleasure equal to the pleasure of climbing a dangerous Alp ; but it is a pleasure which is confined strictly to people who can find pleasure in it .
Parsing [sent. 4510 len. 20]: I have not jumped to this conclusion ; I have traveled to it per gravel-train , so to speak .
Parsing [sent. 4511 len. 16]: I have thought the thing all out , and am quite sure I am right .
Parsing [sent. 4512 len. 42]: A born climber 's appetite for climbing is hard to satisfy ; when it comes upon him he is like a starving man with a feast before him ; he may have other business on hand , but it must wait .
Parsing [sent. 4513 len. 75]: Mr. Girdlestone had had his usual summer holiday in the Alps , and had spent it in his usual way , hunting for unique chances to break his neck ; his vacation was over , and his luggage packed for England , but all of a sudden a hunger had come upon him to climb the tremendous Weisshorn once more , for he had heard of a new and utterly impossible route up it .
Parsing [sent. 4514 len. 34]: His baggage was unpacked at once , and now he and a friend , laden with knapsacks , ice-axes , coils of rope , and canteens of milk , were just setting out .
Parsing [sent. 4515 len. 26]: They would spend the night high up among the snows , somewhere , and get up at two in the morning and finish the enterprise .
Parsing [sent. 4516 len. 30]: I had a strong desire to go with them , but forced it down -- a feat which Mr. Girdlestone , with all his fortitude , could not do .
Parsing [sent. 4517 len. 15]: Even ladies catch the climbing mania , and are unable to throw it off .
Parsing [sent. 4518 len. 55]: A famous climber , of that sex , had attempted the Weisshorn a few days before our arrival , and she and her guides had lost their way in a snow-storm high up among the peaks and glaciers and been forced to wander around a good while before they could find a way down .
Parsing [sent. 4519 len. 16]: When this lady reached the bottom , she had been on her feet twenty-three hours !
Parsing [sent. 4520 len. 17]: Our guides , hired on the Gemmi , were already at Zermatt when we reached there .
Parsing [sent. 4521 len. 22]: So there was nothing to interfere with our getting up an adventure whenever we should choose the time and the object .
Parsing [sent. 4522 len. 23]: I resolved to devote my first evening in Zermatt to studying up the subject of Alpine climbing , by way of preparation .
Parsing [sent. 4523 len. 16]: I read several books , and here are some of the things I found out .
Parsing [sent. 4524 len. 16]: One 's shoes must be strong and heavy , and have pointed hobnails in them .
Parsing [sent. 4525 len. 23]: The alpenstock must be of the best wood , for if it should break , loss of life might be the result .
Parsing [sent. 4526 len. 19]: One should carry an ax , to cut steps in the ice with , on the great heights .
Parsing [sent. 4527 len. 57]: There must be a ladder , for there are steep bits of rock which can be surmounted with this instrument -- or this utensil -- but could not be surmounted without it ; such an obstruction has compelled the tourist to waste hours hunting another route , when a ladder would have saved him all trouble .
Parsing [sent. 4528 len. 40]: One must have from one hundred and fifty to five hundred feet of strong rope , to be used in lowering the party down steep declivities which are too steep and smooth to be traversed in any other way .
Parsing [sent. 4529 len. 100]: One must have a steel hook , on another rope -- a very useful thing ; for when one is ascending and comes to a low bluff which is yet too high for the ladder , he swings this rope aloft like a lasso , the hook catches at the top of the bluff , and then the tourist climbs the rope , hand over hand -- being always particular to try and forget that if the hook gives way he will never stop falling till he arrives in some part of Switzerland where they are not expecting him .
Parsing [sent. 4530 len. 46]: Another important thing -- there must be a rope to tie the whole party together with , so that if one falls from a mountain or down a bottomless chasm in a glacier , the others may brace back on the rope and save him .
Parsing [sent. 4531 len. 34]: One must have a silk veil , to protect his face from snow , sleet , hail and gale , and colored goggles to protect his eyes from that dangerous enemy , snow-blindness .
Parsing [sent. 4532 len. 28]: Finally , there must be some porters , to carry provisions , wine and scientific instruments , and also blanket bags for the party to sleep in .
Parsing [sent. 4533 len. 32]: I closed my readings with a fearful adventure which Mr. Whymper once had on the Matterhorn when he was prowling around alone , five thousand feet above the town of Breil .
Parsing [sent. 4534 len. 26]: He was edging his way gingerly around the corner of a precipice where the upper edge of a sharp declivity of ice-glazed snow joined it .
Parsing [sent. 4535 len. 30]: This declivity swept down a couple of hundred feet , into a gully which curved around and ended at a precipice eight hundred feet high , overlooking a glacier .
Parsing [sent. 4536 len. 8]: His foot slipped , and he fell .
Parsing [sent. 4537 len. 89]: He says : `` My knapsack brought my head down first , and I pitched into some rocks about a dozen feet below ; they caught something , and tumbled me off the edge , head over heels , into the gully ; the baton was dashed from my hands , and I whirled downward in a series of bounds , each longer than the last ; now over ice , now into rocks , striking my head four or five times , each time with increased force .
Parsing [sent. 4538 len. 44]: The last bound sent me spinning through the air in a leap of fifty or sixty feet , from one side of the gully to the other , and I struck the rocks , luckily , with the whole of my left side .
Parsing [sent. 4539 len. 20]: They caught my clothes for a moment , and I fell back on to the snow with motion arrested .
Parsing [sent. 4540 len. 34]: My head fortunately came the right side up , and a few frantic catches brought me to a halt , in the neck of the gully and on the verge of the precipice .
Parsing [sent. 4541 len. 42]: Baton , hat , and veil skimmed by and disappeared , and the crash of the rocks -- which I had started -- as they fell on to the glacier , told how narrow had been the escape from utter destruction .
Parsing [sent. 4542 len. 16]: As it was , I fell nearly two hundred feet in seven or eight bounds .
Parsing [sent. 4543 len. 21]: Ten feet more would have taken me in one gigantic leap of eight hundred feet on to the glacier below .
Parsing [sent. 4544 len. 7]: `` The situation was sufficiently serious .
Parsing [sent. 4545 len. 23]: The rocks could not be let go for a moment , and the blood was spurting out of more than twenty cuts .
Parsing [sent. 4546 len. 27]: The most serious ones were in the head , and I vainly tried to close them with one hand , while holding on with the other .
Parsing [sent. 4547 len. 15]: It was useless ; the blood gushed out in blinding jets at each pulsation .
Parsing [sent. 4548 len. 26]: At last , in a moment of inspiration , I kicked out a big lump of snow and struck it as plaster on my head .
Parsing [sent. 4549 len. 14]: The idea was a happy one , and the flow of blood diminished .
Parsing [sent. 4550 len. 24]: Then , scrambling up , I got , not a moment too soon , to a place of safety , and fainted away .
Parsing [sent. 4551 len. 52]: The sun was setting when consciousness returned , and it was pitch-dark before the Great Staircase was descended ; but by a combination of luck and care , the whole four thousand seven hundred feet of descent to Breil was accomplished without a slip , or once missing the way . ''
Parsing [sent. 4552 len. 8]: His wounds kept him abed some days .
Parsing [sent. 4553 len. 10]: Then he got up and climbed that mountain again .
Parsing [sent. 4554 len. 20]: That is the way with a true Alp-climber ; the more fun he has , the more he wants .
Parsing [sent. 4555 len. 55]: CHAPTER XXXVII -LSB- Our Imposing Column Starts Upward -RSB- After I had finished my readings , I was no longer myself ; I was tranced , uplifted , intoxicated , by the almost incredible perils and adventures I had been following my authors through , and the triumphs I had been sharing with them .
Parsing [sent. 4556 len. 21]: I sat silent some time , then turned to Harris and said : `` My mind is made up . ''
Parsing [sent. 4557 len. 26]: Something in my tone struck him : and when he glanced at my eye and read what was written there , his face paled perceptibly .
Parsing [sent. 4558 len. 12]: He hesitated a moment , then said : `` Speak . ''
Parsing [sent. 4559 len. 15]: I answered , with perfect calmness : `` I will ascend the Riffelberg . ''
Parsing [sent. 4560 len. 18]: If I had shot my poor friend he could not have fallen from his chair more suddenly .
Parsing [sent. 4561 len. 21]: If I had been his father he could not have pleaded harder to get me to give up my purpose .
Parsing [sent. 4562 len. 11]: But I turned a deaf ear to all he said .
Parsing [sent. 4563 len. 31]: When he perceived at last that nothing could alter my determination , he ceased to urge , and for a while the deep silence was broken only by his sobs .
Parsing [sent. 4564 len. 41]: I sat in marble resolution , with my eyes fixed upon vacancy , for in spirit I was already wrestling with the perils of the mountains , and my friend sat gazing at me in adoring admiration through his tears .
Parsing [sent. 4565 len. 25]: At last he threw himself upon me in a loving embrace and exclaimed in broken tones : `` Your Harris will never desert you .
Parsing [sent. 4566 len. 6]: We will die together . ''
Parsing [sent. 4567 len. 22]: I cheered the noble fellow with praises , and soon his fears were forgotten and he was eager for the adventure .
Parsing [sent. 4568 len. 60]: He wanted to summon the guides at once and leave at two in the morning , as he supposed the custom was ; but I explained that nobody was looking at that hour ; and that the start in the dark was not usually made from the village but from the first night 's resting-place on the mountain side .
Parsing [sent. 4569 len. 38]: I said we would leave the village at 3 or 4 P.M. on the morrow ; meantime he could notify the guides , and also let the public know of the attempt which we proposed to make .
Parsing [sent. 4570 len. 10]: I went to bed , but not to sleep .
Parsing [sent. 4571 len. 16]: No man can sleep when he is about to undertake one of these Alpine exploits .
Parsing [sent. 4572 len. 31]: I tossed feverishly all night long , and was glad enough when I heard the clock strike half past eleven and knew it was time to get up for dinner .
Parsing [sent. 4573 len. 32]: I rose , jaded and rusty , and went to the noon meal , where I found myself the center of interest and curiosity ; for the news was already abroad .
Parsing [sent. 4574 len. 21]: It is not easy to eat calmly when you are a lion ; but it is very pleasant , nevertheless .
Parsing [sent. 4575 len. 38]: As usual , at Zermatt , when a great ascent is about to be undertaken , everybody , native and foreign , laid aside his own projects and took up a good position to observe the start .
Parsing [sent. 4576 len. 18]: The expedition consisted of 198 persons , including the mules ; or 205 , including the cows .
Parsing [sent. 4577 len. 52]: As follows : CHIEFS OF SERVICE SUBORDINATES Myself 1 Veterinary Surgeon Mr. Harris 1 Butler 17 Guides 12 Waiters 4 Surgeons 1 Footman 1 Geologist 1 Barber 1 Botanist 1 Head Cook 3 Chaplains 9 Assistants 2 Draftsman 4 Pastry Cooks 15 Barkeepers 1 Confectionery Artist 1 Latinist TRANSPORTATION , ETC. .
Parsing [sent. 4578 len. 26]: 27 Porters 3 Coarse Washers and Ironers 44 Mules 1 Fine ditto 44 Muleteers 7 Cows 2 Milkers Total , 154 men , 51 animals .
Parsing [sent. 4579 len. 5]: Grand Total , 205 .
Parsing [sent. 4580 len. 4]: RATIONS , ETC. .
Parsing [sent. 4581 len. 85]: APPARATUS 16 Cases Hams 25 Spring Mattresses 2 Barrels Flour 2 Hair ditto 22 Barrels Whiskey Bedding for same 1 Barrel Sugar 2 Mosquito-nets 1 Keg Lemons 29 Tents 2,000 Cigars Scientific Instruments 1 Barrel Pies 97 Ice-axes 1 Ton of Pemmican 5 Cases Dynamite 143 Pair Crutches 7 Cans Nitroglycerin 2 Barrels Arnica 22 40-foot Ladders 1 Bale of Lint 2 Miles of Rope 27 Kegs Paregoric 154 Umbrellas It was full four o'clock in the afternoon before my cavalcade was entirely ready .
Parsing [sent. 4582 len. 8]: At that hour it began to move .
Parsing [sent. 4583 len. 21]: In point of numbers and spectacular effect , it was the most imposing expedition that had ever marched from Zermatt .
Parsing [sent. 4584 len. 29]: I commanded the chief guide to arrange the men and animals in single file , twelve feet apart , and lash them all together on a strong rope .
Parsing [sent. 4585 len. 30]: He objected that the first two miles was a dead level , with plenty of room , and that the rope was never used except in very dangerous places .
Parsing [sent. 4586 len. 8]: But I would not listen to that .
Parsing [sent. 4587 len. 36]: My reading had taught me that many serious accidents had happened in the Alps simply from not having the people tied up soon enough ; I was not going to add one to the list .
Parsing [sent. 4588 len. 7]: The guide then obeyed my order .
Parsing [sent. 4589 len. 22]: When the procession stood at ease , roped together , and ready to move , I never saw a finer sight .
Parsing [sent. 4590 len. 84]: It was 3,122 feet long -- over half a mile ; every man and me was on foot , and had on his green veil and his blue goggles , and his white rag around his hat , and his coil of rope over one shoulder and under the other , and his ice-ax in his belt , and carried his alpenstock in his left hand , his umbrella -LRB- closed -RRB- in his right , and his crutches slung at his back .
Parsing [sent. 4591 len. 21]: The burdens of the pack-mules and the horns of the cows were decked with the Edelweiss and the Alpine rose .
Parsing [sent. 4592 len. 10]: I and my agent were the only persons mounted .
Parsing [sent. 4593 len. 20]: We were in the post of danger in the extreme rear , and tied securely to five guides apiece .
Parsing [sent. 4594 len. 14]: Our armor-bearers carried our ice-axes , alpenstocks , and other implements for us .
Parsing [sent. 4595 len. 35]: We were mounted upon very small donkeys , as a measure of safety ; in time of peril we could straighten our legs and stand up , and let the donkey walk from under .
Parsing [sent. 4596 len. 26]: Still , I can not recommend this sort of animal -- at least for excursions of mere pleasure -- because his ears interrupt the view .
Parsing [sent. 4597 len. 17]: I and my agent possessed the regulation mountaineering costumes , but concluded to leave them behind .
Parsing [sent. 4598 len. 54]: Out of respect for the great numbers of tourists of both sexes who would be assembled in front of the hotels to see us pass , and also out of respect for the many tourists whom we expected to encounter on our expedition , we decided to make the ascent in evening dress .
Parsing [sent. 4599 len. 31]: We watered the caravan at the cold stream which rushes down a trough near the end of the village , and soon afterward left the haunts of civilization behind us .
Parsing [sent. 4600 len. 34]: About half past five o'clock we arrived at a bridge which spans the Visp , and after throwing over a detachment to see if it was safe , the caravan crossed without accident .
Parsing [sent. 4601 len. 22]: The way now led , by a gentle ascent , carpeted with fresh green grass , to the church at Winkelmatten .
Parsing [sent. 4602 len. 29]: Without stopping to examine this edifice , I executed a flank movement to the right and crossed the bridge over the Findelenbach , after first testing its strength .
Parsing [sent. 4603 len. 31]: Here I deployed to the right again , and presently entered an inviting stretch of meadowland which was unoccupied save by a couple of deserted huts toward the furthest extremity .
Parsing [sent. 4604 len. 7]: These meadows offered an excellent camping-place .
Parsing [sent. 4605 len. 25]: We pitched our tents , supped , established a proper grade , recorded the events of the day , and then went to bed .
Parsing [sent. 4606 len. 12]: We rose at two in the morning and dressed by candle-light .
Parsing [sent. 4607 len. 8]: It was a dismal and chilly business .
Parsing [sent. 4608 len. 29]: A few stars were shining , but the general heavens were overcast , and the great shaft of the Matterhorn was draped in a cable pall of clouds .
Parsing [sent. 4609 len. 17]: The chief guide advised a delay ; he said he feared it was going to rain .
Parsing [sent. 4610 len. 15]: We waited until nine o'clock , and then got away in tolerably clear weather .
Parsing [sent. 4611 len. 32]: Our course led up some terrific steeps , densely wooded with larches and cedars , and traversed by paths which the rains had guttered and which were obstructed by loose stones .
Parsing [sent. 4612 len. 40]: To add to the danger and inconvenience , we were constantly meeting returning tourists on foot and horseback , and as constantly being crowded and battered by ascending tourists who were in a hurry and wanted to get by .
Parsing [sent. 4613 len. 4]: Our troubles thickened .
Parsing [sent. 4614 len. 17]: About the middle of the afternoon the seventeen guides called a halt and held a consultation .
Parsing [sent. 4615 len. 23]: After consulting an hour they said their first suspicion remained intact -- that is to say , they believed they were lost .
Parsing [sent. 4616 len. 9]: I asked if they did not KNOW it ?
Parsing [sent. 4617 len. 32]: No , they said , they COULD N'T absolutely know whether they were lost or not , because none of them had ever been in that part of the country before .
Parsing [sent. 4618 len. 26]: They had a strong instinct that they were lost , but they had no proofs -- except that they did not know where they were .
Parsing [sent. 4619 len. 17]: They had met no tourists for some time , and they considered that a suspicious sign .
Parsing [sent. 4620 len. 8]: Plainly we were in an ugly fix .
Parsing [sent. 4621 len. 23]: The guides were naturally unwilling to go alone and seek a way out of the difficulty ; so we all went together .
Parsing [sent. 4622 len. 16]: For better security we moved slow and cautiously , for the forest was very dense .
Parsing [sent. 4623 len. 20]: We did not move up the mountain , but around it , hoping to strike across the old trail .
Parsing [sent. 4624 len. 22]: Toward nightfall , when we were about tired out , we came up against a rock as big as a cottage .
Parsing [sent. 4625 len. 21]: This barrier took all the remaining spirit out of the men , and a panic of fear and despair ensued .
Parsing [sent. 4626 len. 19]: They moaned and wept , and said they should never see their homes and their dear ones again .
Parsing [sent. 4627 len. 14]: Then they began to upbraid me for bringing them upon this fatal expedition .
Parsing [sent. 4628 len. 7]: Some even muttered threats against me .
Parsing [sent. 4629 len. 9]: Clearly it was no time to show weakness .
Parsing [sent. 4630 len. 31]: So I made a speech in which I said that other Alp-climbers had been in as perilous a position as this , and yet by courage and perseverance had escaped .
Parsing [sent. 4631 len. 13]: I promised to stand by them , I promised to rescue them .
Parsing [sent. 4632 len. 49]: I closed by saying we had plenty of provisions to maintain us for quite a siege -- and did they suppose Zermatt would allow half a mile of men and mules to mysteriously disappear during any considerable time , right above their noses , and make no inquiries ?
Parsing [sent. 4633 len. 13]: No , Zermatt would send out searching-expeditions and we should be saved .
Parsing [sent. 4634 len. 7]: This speech had a great effect .
Parsing [sent. 4635 len. 24]: The men pitched the tents with some little show of cheerfulness , and we were snugly under cover when the night shut down .
Parsing [sent. 4636 len. 25]: I now reaped the reward of my wisdom in providing one article which is not mentioned in any book of Alpine adventure but this .
Parsing [sent. 4637 len. 6]: I refer to the paregoric .
Parsing [sent. 4638 len. 21]: But for that beneficent drug , would have not one of those men slept a moment during that fearful night .
Parsing [sent. 4639 len. 23]: But for that gentle persuader they must have tossed , unsoothed , the night through ; for the whiskey was for me .
Parsing [sent. 4640 len. 15]: Yes , they would have risen in the morning unfitted for their heavy task .
Parsing [sent. 4641 len. 18]: As it was , everybody slept but my agent and me -- only we and the barkeepers .
Parsing [sent. 4642 len. 12]: I would not permit myself to sleep at such a time .
Parsing [sent. 4643 len. 9]: I considered myself responsible for all those lives .
Parsing [sent. 4644 len. 24]: I meant to be on hand and ready , in case of avalanches up there , but I did not know it then .
Parsing [sent. 4645 len. 26]: We watched the weather all through that awful night , and kept an eye on the barometer , to be prepared for the least change .
Parsing [sent. 4646 len. 16]: There was not the slightest change recorded by the instrument , during the whole time .
Parsing [sent. 4647 len. 23]: Words can not describe the comfort that that friendly , hopeful , steadfast thing was to me in that season of trouble .
Parsing [sent. 4648 len. 25]: It was a defective barometer , and had no hand but the stationary brass pointer , but I did not know that until afterward .
Parsing [sent. 4649 len. 21]: If I should be in such a situation again , I should not wish for any barometer but that one .
Parsing [sent. 4650 len. 29]: All hands rose at two in the morning and took breakfast , and as soon as it was light we roped ourselves together and went at that rock .
Parsing [sent. 4651 len. 25]: For some time we tried the hook-rope and other means of scaling it , but without success -- that is , without perfect success .
Parsing [sent. 4652 len. 41]: The hook caught once , and Harris started up it hand over hand , but the hold broke and if there had not happened to be a chaplain sitting underneath at the time , Harris would certainly have been crippled .
Parsing [sent. 4653 len. 9]: As it was , it was the chaplain .
Parsing [sent. 4654 len. 16]: He took to his crutches , and I ordered the hook-rope to be laid aside .
Parsing [sent. 4655 len. 14]: It was too dangerous an implement where so many people are standing around .
Parsing [sent. 4656 len. 14]: We were puzzled for a while ; then somebody thought of the ladders .
Parsing [sent. 4657 len. 20]: One of these was leaned against the rock , and the men went up it tied together in couples .
Parsing [sent. 4658 len. 10]: Another ladder was sent up for use in descending .
Parsing [sent. 4659 len. 17]: At the end of half an hour everybody was over , and that rock was conquered .
Parsing [sent. 4660 len. 9]: We gave our first grand shout of triumph .
Parsing [sent. 4661 len. 19]: But the joy was short-lived , for somebody asked how we were going to get the animals over .
Parsing [sent. 4662 len. 14]: This was a serious difficulty ; in fact , it was an impossibility .
Parsing [sent. 4663 len. 19]: The courage of the men began to waver immediately ; once more we were threatened with a panic .
Parsing [sent. 4664 len. 16]: But when the danger was most imminent , we were saved in a mysterious way .
Parsing [sent. 4665 len. 24]: A mule which had attracted attention from the beginning by its disposition to experiment , tried to eat a five-pound can of nitroglycerin .
Parsing [sent. 4666 len. 7]: This happened right alongside the rock .
Parsing [sent. 4667 len. 43]: The explosion threw us all to the ground , and covered us with dirt and debris ; it frightened us extremely , too , for the crash it made was deafening , and the violence of the shock made the ground tremble .
Parsing [sent. 4668 len. 12]: However , we were grateful , for the rock was gone .
Parsing [sent. 4669 len. 19]: Its place was occupied by a new cellar , about thirty feet across , by fifteen feet deep .
Parsing [sent. 4670 len. 39]: The explosion was heard as far as Zermatt ; and an hour and a half afterward , many citizens of that town were knocked down and quite seriously injured by descending portions of mule meat , frozen solid .
Parsing [sent. 4671 len. 16]: This shows , better than any estimate in figures , how high the experimenter went .
Parsing [sent. 4672 len. 18]: We had nothing to do , now , but bridge the cellar and proceed on our way .
Parsing [sent. 4673 len. 10]: With a cheer the men went at their work .
Parsing [sent. 4674 len. 8]: I attended to the engineering , myself .
Parsing [sent. 4675 len. 21]: I appointed a strong detail to cut down trees with ice-axes and trim them for piers to support the bridge .
Parsing [sent. 4676 len. 16]: This was a slow business , for ice-axes are not good to cut wood with .
Parsing [sent. 4677 len. 39]: I caused my piers to be firmly set up in ranks in the cellar , and upon them I laid six of my forty-foot ladders , side by side , and laid six more on top of them .
Parsing [sent. 4678 len. 27]: Upon this bridge I caused a bed of boughs to be spread , and on top of the boughs a bed of earth six inches deep .
Parsing [sent. 4679 len. 18]: I stretched ropes upon either side to serve as railings , and then my bridge was complete .
Parsing [sent. 4680 len. 13]: A train of elephants could have crossed it in safety and comfort .
Parsing [sent. 4681 len. 16]: By nightfall the caravan was on the other side and the ladders were taken up .
Parsing [sent. 4682 len. 72]: Next morning we went on in good spirits for a while , though our way was slow and difficult , by reason of the steep and rocky nature of the ground and the thickness of the forest ; but at last a dull despondency crept into the men 's faces and it was apparent that not only they , but even the guides , were now convinced that we were lost .
Parsing [sent. 4683 len. 17]: The fact that we still met no tourists was a circumstance that was but too significant .
Parsing [sent. 4684 len. 39]: Another thing seemed to suggest that we were not only lost , but very badly lost ; for there must surely be searching-parties on the road before this time , yet we had seen no sign of them .
Parsing [sent. 4685 len. 15]: Demoralization was spreading ; something must be done , and done quickly , too .
Parsing [sent. 4686 len. 9]: Fortunately , I am not unfertile in expedients .
Parsing [sent. 4687 len. 15]: I contrived one now which commended itself to all , for it promised well .
Parsing [sent. 4688 len. 35]: I took three-quarters of a mile of rope and fastened one end of it around the waist of a guide , and told him to go find the road , while the caravan waited .
Parsing [sent. 4689 len. 43]: I instructed him to guide himself back by the rope , in case of failure ; in case of success , he was to give the rope a series of violent jerks , whereupon the Expedition would go to him at once .
Parsing [sent. 4690 len. 13]: He departed , and in two minutes had disappeared among the trees .
Parsing [sent. 4691 len. 17]: I payed out the rope myself , while everybody watched the crawling thing with eager eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4692 len. 17]: The rope crept away quite slowly , at times , at other times with some briskness .
Parsing [sent. 4693 len. 32]: Twice or thrice we seemed to get the signal , and a shout was just ready to break from the men 's lips when they perceived it was a false alarm .
Parsing [sent. 4694 len. 39]: But at last , when over half a mile of rope had slidden away , it stopped gliding and stood absolutely still -- one minute -- two minutes -- three -- while we held our breath and watched .
Parsing [sent. 4695 len. 5]: Was the guide resting ?
Parsing [sent. 4696 len. 10]: Was he scanning the country from some high point ?
Parsing [sent. 4697 len. 8]: Was he inquiring of a chance mountaineer ?
Parsing [sent. 4698 len. 13]: Stop , -- had he fainted from excess of fatigue and anxiety ?
Parsing [sent. 4699 len. 7]: This thought gave us a shock .
Parsing [sent. 4700 len. 36]: I was in the very first act of detailing an Expedition to succor him , when the cord was assailed with a series of such frantic jerks that I could hardly keep hold of it .
Parsing [sent. 4701 len. 13]: The huzza that went up , then , was good to hear .
Parsing [sent. 4702 len. 3]: `` Saved !
Parsing [sent. 4703 len. 3]: saved ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4704 len. 16]: was the word that rang out , all down the long rank of the caravan .
Parsing [sent. 4705 len. 8]: We rose up and started at once .
Parsing [sent. 4706 len. 29]: We found the route to be good enough for a while , but it began to grow difficult , by and by , and this feature steadily increased .
Parsing [sent. 4707 len. 46]: When we judged we had gone half a mile , we momently expected to see the guide ; but no , he was not visible anywhere ; neither was he waiting , for the rope was still moving , consequently he was doing the same .
Parsing [sent. 4708 len. 21]: This argued that he had not found the road , yet , but was marching to it with some peasant .
Parsing [sent. 4709 len. 16]: There was nothing for us to do but plod along -- and this we did .
Parsing [sent. 4710 len. 11]: At the end of three hours we were still plodding .
Parsing [sent. 4711 len. 9]: This was not only mysterious , but exasperating .
Parsing [sent. 4712 len. 53]: And very fatiguing , too ; for we had tried hard , along at first , to catch up with the guide , but had only fagged ourselves , in vain ; for although he was traveling slowly he was yet able to go faster than the hampered caravan over such ground .
Parsing [sent. 4713 len. 21]: At three in the afternoon we were nearly dead with exhaustion -- and still the rope was slowly gliding out .
Parsing [sent. 4714 len. 20]: The murmurs against the guide had been growing steadily , and at last they were become loud and savage .
Parsing [sent. 4715 len. 4]: A mutiny ensued .
Parsing [sent. 4716 len. 6]: The men refused to proceed .
Parsing [sent. 4717 len. 22]: They declared that we had been traveling over and over the same ground all day , in a kind of circle .
Parsing [sent. 4718 len. 30]: They demanded that our end of the rope be made fast to a tree , so as to halt the guide until we could overtake him and kill him .
Parsing [sent. 4719 len. 13]: This was not an unreasonable requirement , so I gave the order .
Parsing [sent. 4720 len. 23]: As soon as the rope was tied , the Expedition moved forward with that alacrity which the thirst for vengeance usually inspires .
Parsing [sent. 4721 len. 43]: But after a tiresome march of almost half a mile , we came to a hill covered thick with a crumbly rubbish of stones , and so steep that no man of us all was now in a condition to climb it .
Parsing [sent. 4722 len. 10]: Every attempt failed , and ended in crippling somebody .
Parsing [sent. 4723 len. 10]: Within twenty minutes I had five men on crutches .
Parsing [sent. 4724 len. 19]: Whenever a climber tried to assist himself by the rope , it yielded and let him tumble backward .
Parsing [sent. 4725 len. 11]: The frequency of this result suggested an idea to me .
Parsing [sent. 4726 len. 44]: I ordered the caravan to ` bout face and form in marching order ; I then made the tow-rope fast to the rear mule , and gave the command : `` Mark time -- by the right flank -- forward -- march ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4727 len. 41]: The procession began to move , to the impressive strains of a battle-chant , and I said to myself , `` Now , if the rope do n't break I judge THIS will fetch that guide into the camp . ''
Parsing [sent. 4728 len. 45]: I watched the rope gliding down the hill , and presently when I was all fixed for triumph I was confronted by a bitter disappointment ; there was no guide tied to the rope , it was only a very indignant old black ram .
Parsing [sent. 4729 len. 10]: The fury of the baffled Expedition exceeded all bounds .
Parsing [sent. 4730 len. 14]: They even wanted to wreak their unreasoning vengeance on this innocent dumb brute .
Parsing [sent. 4731 len. 39]: But I stood between them and their prey , menaced by a bristling wall of ice-axes and alpenstocks , and proclaimed that there was but one road to this murder , and it was directly over my corpse .
Parsing [sent. 4732 len. 25]: Even as I spoke I saw that my doom was sealed , except a miracle supervened to divert these madmen from their fell purpose .
Parsing [sent. 4733 len. 94]: I see the sickening wall of weapons now ; I see that advancing host as I saw it then , I see the hate in those cruel eyes ; I remember how I drooped my head upon my breast , I feel again the sudden earthquake shock in my rear , administered by the very ram I was sacrificing myself to save ; I hear once more the typhoon of laughter that burst from the assaulting column as I clove it from van to rear like a Sepoy shot from a Rodman gun .
Parsing [sent. 4734 len. 4]: I was saved .
Parsing [sent. 4735 len. 25]: Yes , I was saved , and by the merciful instinct of ingratitude which nature had planted in the breast of that treacherous beast .
Parsing [sent. 4736 len. 21]: The grace which eloquence had failed to work in those men 's hearts , had been wrought by a laugh .
Parsing [sent. 4737 len. 11]: The ram was set free and my life was spared .
Parsing [sent. 4738 len. 24]: We lived to find out that that guide had deserted us as soon as he had placed a half-mile between himself and us .
Parsing [sent. 4739 len. 57]: To avert suspicion , he had judged it best that the line should continue to move ; so he caught that ram , and at the time that he was sitting on it making the rope fast to it , we were imagining that he was lying in a swoon , overcome by fatigue and distress .
Parsing [sent. 4740 len. 38]: When he allowed the ram to get up it fell to plunging around , trying to rid itself of the rope , and this was the signal which we had risen up with glad shouts to obey .
Parsing [sent. 4741 len. 39]: We had followed this ram round and round in a circle all day -- a thing which was proven by the discovery that we had watered the Expedition seven times at one and same spring in seven hours .
Parsing [sent. 4742 len. 26]: As expert a woodman as I am , I had somehow failed to notice this until my attention was called to it by a hog .
Parsing [sent. 4743 len. 64]: This hog was always wallowing there , and as he was the only hog we saw , his frequent repetition , together with his unvarying similarity to himself , finally caused me to reflect that he must be the same hog , and this led me to the deduction that this must be the same spring , also -- which indeed it was .
Parsing [sent. 4744 len. 28]: I made a note of this curious thing , as showing in a striking manner the relative difference between glacial action and the action of the hog .
Parsing [sent. 4745 len. 33]: It is now a well-established fact that glaciers move ; I consider that my observations go to show , with equal conclusiveness , that a hog in a spring does not move .
Parsing [sent. 4746 len. 15]: I shall be glad to receive the opinions of other observers upon this point .
Parsing [sent. 4747 len. 21]: To return , for an explanatory moment , to that guide , and then I shall be done with him .
Parsing [sent. 4748 len. 26]: After leaving the ram tied to the rope , he had wandered at large a while , and then happened to run across a cow .
Parsing [sent. 4749 len. 26]: Judging that a cow would naturally know more than a guide , he took her by the tail , and the result justified his judgment .
Parsing [sent. 4750 len. 23]: She nibbled her leisurely way downhill till it was near milking-time , then she struck for home and towed him into Zermatt .
Parsing [sent. 4751 len. 25]: CHAPTER XXXVIII -LSB- I Conquer the Gorner Grat -RSB- We went into camp on that wild spot to which that ram had brought us .
Parsing [sent. 4752 len. 6]: The men were greatly fatigued .
Parsing [sent. 4753 len. 39]: Their conviction that we were lost was forgotten in the cheer of a good supper , and before the reaction had a chance to set in , I loaded them up with paregoric and put them to bed .
Parsing [sent. 4754 len. 52]: Next morning I was considering in my mind our desperate situation and trying to think of a remedy , when Harris came to me with a Baedeker map which showed conclusively that the mountain we were on was still in Switzerland -- yes , every part of it was in Switzerland .
Parsing [sent. 4755 len. 9]: So we were not lost , after all .
Parsing [sent. 4756 len. 18]: This was an immense relief ; it lifted the weight of two such mountains from my breast .
Parsing [sent. 4757 len. 12]: I immediately had the news disseminated and the map was exhibited .
Parsing [sent. 4758 len. 5]: The effect was wonderful .
Parsing [sent. 4759 len. 49]: As soon as the men saw with their own eyes that they knew where they were , and that it was only the summit that was lost and not themselves , they cheered up instantly and said with one accord , let the summit take care of itself .
Parsing [sent. 4760 len. 27]: Our distresses being at an end , I now determined to rest the men in camp and give the scientific department of the Expedition a chance .
Parsing [sent. 4761 len. 24]: First , I made a barometric observation , to get our altitude , but I could not perceive that there was any result .
Parsing [sent. 4762 len. 37]: I knew , by my scientific reading , that either thermometers or barometers ought to be boiled , to make them accurate ; I did not know which it was , so I boiled them both .
Parsing [sent. 4763 len. 39]: There was still no result ; so I examined these instruments and discovered that they possessed radical blemishes : the barometer had no hand but the brass pointer and the ball of the thermometer was stuffed with tin-foil .
Parsing [sent. 4764 len. 15]: I might have boiled those things to rags , and never found out anything .
Parsing [sent. 4765 len. 12]: I hunted up another barometer ; it was new and perfect .
Parsing [sent. 4766 len. 18]: I boiled it half an hour in a pot of bean soup which the cooks were making .
Parsing [sent. 4767 len. 45]: The result was unexpected : the instrument was not affecting at all , but there was such a strong barometer taste to the soup that the head cook , who was a most conscientious person , changed its name in the bill of fare .
Parsing [sent. 4768 len. 21]: The dish was so greatly liked by all , that I ordered the cook to have barometer soup every day .
Parsing [sent. 4769 len. 19]: It was believed that the barometer might eventually be injured , but I did not care for that .
Parsing [sent. 4770 len. 26]: I had demonstrated to my satisfaction that it could not tell how high a mountain was , therefore I had no real use for it .
Parsing [sent. 4771 len. 52]: Changes in the weather I could take care of without it ; I did not wish to know when the weather was going to be good , what I wanted to know was when it was going to be bad , and this I could find out from Harris 's corns .
Parsing [sent. 4772 len. 24]: Harris had had his corns tested and regulated at the government observatory in Heidelberg , and one could depend upon them with confidence .
Parsing [sent. 4773 len. 19]: So I transferred the new barometer to the cooking department , to be used for the official mess .
Parsing [sent. 4774 len. 32]: It was found that even a pretty fair article of soup could be made from the defective barometer ; so I allowed that one to be transferred to the subordinate mess .
Parsing [sent. 4775 len. 23]: I next boiled the thermometer , and got a most excellent result ; the mercury went up to about 200 degrees Fahrenheit .
Parsing [sent. 4776 len. 30]: In the opinion of the other scientists of the Expedition , this seemed to indicate that we had attained the extraordinary altitude of two hundred thousand feet above sea-level .
Parsing [sent. 4777 len. 15]: Science places the line of eternal snow at about ten thousand feet above sea-level .
Parsing [sent. 4778 len. 29]: There was no snow where we were , consequently it was proven that the eternal snow-line ceases somewhere above the ten-thousand-foot level and does not begin any more .
Parsing [sent. 4779 len. 18]: This was an interesting fact , and one which had not been observed by any observer before .
Parsing [sent. 4780 len. 26]: It was as valuable as interesting , too , since it would open up the deserted summits of the highest Alps to population and agriculture .
Parsing [sent. 4781 len. 37]: It was a proud thing to be where we were , yet it caused us a pang to reflect that but for that ram we might just as well have been two hundred thousand feet higher .
Parsing [sent. 4782 len. 17]: The success of my last experiment induced me to try an experiment with my photographic apparatus .
Parsing [sent. 4783 len. 44]: I got it out , and boiled one of my cameras , but the thing was a failure ; it made the wood swell up and burst , and I could not see that the lenses were any better than they were before .
Parsing [sent. 4784 len. 8]: I now concluded to boil a guide .
Parsing [sent. 4785 len. 12]: It might improve him , it could not impair his usefulness .
Parsing [sent. 4786 len. 8]: But I was not allowed to proceed .
Parsing [sent. 4787 len. 21]: Guides have no feeling for science , and this one would not consent to be made uncomfortable in its interest .
Parsing [sent. 4788 len. 24]: In the midst of my scientific work , one of those needless accidents happened which are always occurring among the ignorant and thoughtless .
Parsing [sent. 4789 len. 14]: A porter shot at a chamois and missed it and crippled the Latinist .
Parsing [sent. 4790 len. 47]: This was not a serious matter to me , for a Latinist 's duties are as well performed on crutches as otherwise -- but the fact remained that if the Latinist had not happened to be in the way a mule would have got that load .
Parsing [sent. 4791 len. 30]: That would have been quite another matter , for when it comes down to a question of value there is a palpable difference between a Latinist and a mule .
Parsing [sent. 4792 len. 47]: I could not depend on having a Latinist in the right place every time ; so , to make things safe , I ordered that in the future the chamois must not be hunted within limits of the camp with any other weapon than the forefinger .
Parsing [sent. 4793 len. 42]: My nerves had hardly grown quiet after this affair when they got another shake-up -- one which utterly unmanned me for a moment : a rumor swept suddenly through the camp that one of the barkeepers had fallen over a precipice !
Parsing [sent. 4794 len. 12]: However , it turned out that it was only a chaplain .
Parsing [sent. 4795 len. 35]: I had laid in an extra force of chaplains , purposely to be prepared for emergencies like this , but by some unaccountable oversight had come away rather short-handed in the matter of barkeepers .
Parsing [sent. 4796 len. 15]: On the following morning we moved on , well refreshed and in good spirits .
Parsing [sent. 4797 len. 17]: I remember this day with peculiar pleasure , because it saw our road restored to us .
Parsing [sent. 4798 len. 15]: Yes , we found our road again , and in quite an extraordinary way .
Parsing [sent. 4799 len. 26]: We had plodded along some two hours and a half , when we came up against a solid mass of rock about twenty feet high .
Parsing [sent. 4800 len. 13]: I did not need to be instructed by a mule this time .
Parsing [sent. 4801 len. 14]: I was already beginning to know more than any mule in the Expedition .
Parsing [sent. 4802 len. 19]: I at once put in a blast of dynamite , and lifted that rock out of the way .
Parsing [sent. 4803 len. 20]: But to my surprise and mortification , I found that there had been a chalet on top of it .
Parsing [sent. 4804 len. 23]: I picked up such members of the family as fell in my vicinity , and subordinates of my corps collected the rest .
Parsing [sent. 4805 len. 16]: None of these poor people were injured , happily , but they were much annoyed .
Parsing [sent. 4806 len. 39]: I explained to the head chaleteer just how the thing happened , and that I was only searching for the road , and would certainly have given him timely notice if I had known he was up there .
Parsing [sent. 4807 len. 28]: I said I had meant no harm , and hoped I had not lowered myself in his estimation by raising him a few rods in the air .
Parsing [sent. 4808 len. 35]: I said many other judicious things , and finally when I offered to rebuild his chalet , and pay for the breakages , and throw in the cellar , he was mollified and satisfied .
Parsing [sent. 4809 len. 41]: He had n't any cellar at all , before ; he would not have as good a view , now , as formerly , but what he had lost in view he had gained in cellar , by exact measurement .
Parsing [sent. 4810 len. 32]: He said there was n't another hole like that in the mountains -- and he would have been right if the late mule had not tried to eat up the nitroglycerin .
Parsing [sent. 4811 len. 23]: I put a hundred and sixteen men at work , and they rebuilt the chalet from its own debris in fifteen minutes .
Parsing [sent. 4812 len. 14]: It was a good deal more picturesque than it was before , too .
Parsing [sent. 4813 len. 46]: The man said we were now on the Feil-Stutz , above the Schwegmatt -- information which I was glad to get , since it gave us our position to a degree of particularity which we had not been accustomed to for a day or so .
Parsing [sent. 4814 len. 26]: We also learned that we were standing at the foot of the Riffelberg proper , and that the initial chapter of our work was completed .
Parsing [sent. 4815 len. 59]: We had a fine view , from here , of the energetic Visp , as it makes its first plunge into the world from under a huge arch of solid ice , worn through the foot-wall of the great Gorner Glacier ; and we could also see the Furggenbach , which is the outlet of the Furggen Glacier .
Parsing [sent. 4816 len. 39]: The mule-road to the summit of the Riffelberg passed right in front of the chalet , a circumstance which we almost immediately noticed , because a procession of tourists was filing along it pretty much all the time .
Parsing [sent. 4817 len. 18]: `` Pretty much '' may not be elegant English , but it is high time it was .
Parsing [sent. 4818 len. 14]: There is no elegant word or phrase which means just what it means .
Parsing [sent. 4819 len. 3]: -- M.T. .
Parsing [sent. 4820 len. 11]: The chaleteer 's business consisted in furnishing refreshments to tourists .
Parsing [sent. 4821 len. 56]: My blast had interrupted this trade for a few minutes , by breaking all the bottles on the place ; but I gave the man a lot of whiskey to sell for Alpine champagne , and a lot of vinegar which would answer for Rhine wine , consequently trade was soon as brisk as ever .
Parsing [sent. 4822 len. 30]: Leaving the Expedition outside to rest , I quartered myself in the chalet , with Harris , proposing to correct my journals and scientific observations before continuing the ascent .
Parsing [sent. 4823 len. 54]: I had hardly begun my work when a tall , slender , vigorous American youth of about twenty-three , who was on his way down the mountain , entered and came toward me with that breezy self-complacency which is the adolescent 's idea of the well-bred ease of the man of the world .
Parsing [sent. 4824 len. 40]: His hair was short and parted accurately in the middle , and he had all the look of an American person who would be likely to begin his signature with an initial , and spell his middle name out .
Parsing [sent. 4825 len. 83]: He introduced himself , smiling a smirky smile borrowed from the courtiers of the stage , extended a fair-skinned talon , and while he gripped my hand in it he bent his body forward three times at the hips , as the stage courtier does , and said in the airiest and most condescending and patronizing way -- I quite remember his exact language : `` Very glad to make your acquaintance , 'm sure ; very glad indeed , assure you .
Parsing [sent. 4826 len. 33]: I 've read all your little efforts and greatly admired them , and when I heard you were here , I ... '' I indicated a chair , and he sat down .
Parsing [sent. 4827 len. 42]: This grandee was the grandson of an American of considerable note in his day , and not wholly forgotten yet -- a man who came so near being a great man that he was quite generally accounted one while he lived .
Parsing [sent. 4828 len. 17]: I slowly paced the floor , pondering scientific problems , and heard this conversation : GRANDSON .
Parsing [sent. 4829 len. 5]: First visit to Europe ?
Parsing [sent. 4830 len. 2]: HARRIS .
Parsing [sent. 4831 len. 2]: Mine ?
Parsing [sent. 4832 len. 2]: Yes .
Parsing [sent. 4833 len. 22]: G.S. -LRB- With a soft reminiscent sigh suggestive of bygone joys that may be tasted in their freshness but once . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 4834 len. 10]: Ah , I know what it is to you .
Parsing [sent. 4835 len. 4]: A first visit !
Parsing [sent. 4836 len. 8]: -- ah , the romance of it !
Parsing [sent. 4837 len. 8]: I wish I could feel it again .
Parsing [sent. 4838 len. 11]: H. Yes , I find it exceeds all my dreams .
Parsing [sent. 4839 len. 4]: It is enchantment .
Parsing [sent. 4840 len. 25]: I go ... G.S. -LRB- With a dainty gesture of the hand signifying `` Spare me your callow enthusiasms , good friend . '' -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 4841 len. 65]: Yes , _ I _ know , I know ; you go to cathedrals , and exclaim ; and you drag through league-long picture-galleries and exclaim ; and you stand here , and there , and yonder , upon historic ground , and continue to exclaim ; and you are permeated with your first crude conceptions of Art , and are proud and happy .
Parsing [sent. 4842 len. 12]: Ah , yes , proud and happy -- that expresses it .
Parsing [sent. 4843 len. 15]: Yes-yes , enjoy it -- it is right -- it is an innocent revel .
Parsing [sent. 4844 len. 4]: H. And you ?
Parsing [sent. 4845 len. 8]: Do n't you do these things now ?
Parsing [sent. 4846 len. 3]: G.S. I !
Parsing [sent. 4847 len. 7]: Oh , that is VERY good !
Parsing [sent. 4848 len. 25]: My dear sir , when you are as old a traveler as I am , you will not ask such a question as that .
Parsing [sent. 4849 len. 25]: _ I _ visit the regulation gallery , moon around the regulation cathedral , do the worn round of the regulation sights , YET ?
Parsing [sent. 4850 len. 4]: -- Excuse me !
Parsing [sent. 4851 len. 10]: H. Well , what DO you do , then ?
Parsing [sent. 4852 len. 3]: G.S. Do ?
Parsing [sent. 4853 len. 20]: I flit -- and flit -- for I am ever on the wing -- but I avoid the herd .
Parsing [sent. 4854 len. 40]: Today I am in Paris , tomorrow in Berlin , anon in Rome ; but you would look for me in vain in the galleries of the Louvre or the common resorts of the gazers in those other capitals .
Parsing [sent. 4855 len. 22]: If you would find me , you must look in the unvisited nooks and corners where others never think of going .
Parsing [sent. 4856 len. 78]: One day you will find me making myself at home in some obscure peasant 's cabin , another day you will find me in some forgotten castle worshiping some little gem or art which the careless eye has overlooked and which the unexperienced would despise ; again you will find me as guest in the inner sanctuaries of palaces while the herd is content to get a hurried glimpse of the unused chambers by feeing a servant .
Parsing [sent. 4857 len. 2]: H .
Parsing [sent. 4858 len. 8]: You are a GUEST in such places ?
Parsing [sent. 4859 len. 6]: G.S. And a welcoming one .
Parsing [sent. 4860 len. 2]: H .
Parsing [sent. 4861 len. 4]: It is surprising .
Parsing [sent. 4862 len. 5]: How does it come ?
Parsing [sent. 4863 len. 15]: G.S. My grandfather 's name is a passport to all the courts in Europe .
Parsing [sent. 4864 len. 15]: I have only to utter that name and every door is open to me .
Parsing [sent. 4865 len. 19]: I flit from court to court at my own free will and pleasure , and am always welcome .
Parsing [sent. 4866 len. 18]: I am as much at home in the palaces of Europe as you are among your relatives .
Parsing [sent. 4867 len. 11]: I know every titled person in Europe , I think .
Parsing [sent. 4868 len. 11]: I have my pockets full of invitations all the time .
Parsing [sent. 4869 len. 27]: I am under promise to go to Italy , where I am to be the guest of a succession of the noblest houses in the land .
Parsing [sent. 4870 len. 15]: In Berlin my life is a continued round of gaiety in the imperial palace .
Parsing [sent. 4871 len. 9]: It is the same , wherever I go .
Parsing [sent. 4872 len. 2]: H .
Parsing [sent. 4873 len. 6]: It must be very pleasant .
Parsing [sent. 4874 len. 15]: But it must make Boston seem a little slow when you are at home .
Parsing [sent. 4875 len. 8]: G.S. Yes , of course it does .
Parsing [sent. 4876 len. 8]: But I do n't go home much .
Parsing [sent. 4877 len. 15]: There 's no life there -- little to feed a man 's higher nature .
Parsing [sent. 4878 len. 8]: Boston 's very narrow , you know .
Parsing [sent. 4879 len. 29]: She does n't know it , and you could n't convince her of it -- so I say nothing when I 'm there : where 's the use ?
Parsing [sent. 4880 len. 23]: Yes , Boston is very narrow , but she has such a good opinion of herself that she ca n't see it .
Parsing [sent. 4881 len. 56]: A man who has traveled as much as I have , and seen as much of the world , sees it plain enough , but he ca n't cure it , you know , so the best is to leave it and seek a sphere which is more in harmony with his tastes and culture .
Parsing [sent. 4882 len. 27]: I run across there , once a year , perhaps , when I have nothing important on hand , but I 'm very soon back again .
Parsing [sent. 4883 len. 7]: I spend my time in Europe .
Parsing [sent. 4884 len. 4]: H. I see .
Parsing [sent. 4885 len. 13]: You map out your plans and ... G.S. No , excuse me .
Parsing [sent. 4886 len. 8]: I do n't map out any plans .
Parsing [sent. 4887 len. 9]: I simply follow the inclination of the day .
Parsing [sent. 4888 len. 18]: I am limited by no ties , no requirements , I am not bound in any way .
Parsing [sent. 4889 len. 13]: I am too old a traveler to hamper myself with deliberate purposes .
Parsing [sent. 4890 len. 29]: I am simply a traveler -- an inveterate traveler -- a man of the world , in a word -- I can call myself by no other name .
Parsing [sent. 4891 len. 28]: I do not say , `` I am going here , or I am going there '' -- I say nothing at all , I only act .
Parsing [sent. 4892 len. 31]: For instance , next week you may find me the guest of a grandee of Spain , or you may find me off for Venice , or flitting toward Dresden .
Parsing [sent. 4893 len. 44]: I shall probably go to Egypt presently ; friends will say to friends , `` He is at the Nile cataracts '' -- and at that very moment they will be surprised to learn that I 'm away off yonder in India somewhere .
Parsing [sent. 4894 len. 8]: I am a constant surprise to people .
Parsing [sent. 4895 len. 28]: They are always saying , `` Yes , he was in Jerusalem when we heard of him last , but goodness knows where he is now . ''
Parsing [sent. 4896 len. 18]: Presently the Grandson rose to leave -- discovered he had an appointment with some Emperor , perhaps .
Parsing [sent. 4897 len. 52]: He did his graces over again : gripped me with one talon , at arm 's - length , pressed his hat against his stomach with the other , bent his body in the middle three times , murmuring : `` Pleasure , 'm sure ; great pleasure , 'm sure .
Parsing [sent. 4898 len. 6]: Wish you much success . ''
Parsing [sent. 4899 len. 7]: Then he removed his gracious presence .
Parsing [sent. 4900 len. 12]: It is a great and solemn thing to have a grandfather .
Parsing [sent. 4901 len. 30]: I have not purposed to misrepresent this boy in any way , for what little indignation he excited in me soon passed and left nothing behind it but compassion .
Parsing [sent. 4902 len. 11]: One can not keep up a grudge against a vacuum .
Parsing [sent. 4903 len. 33]: I have tried to repeat this lad 's very words ; if I have failed anywhere I have at least not failed to reproduce the marrow and meaning of what he said .
Parsing [sent. 4904 len. 30]: He and the innocent chatterbox whom I met on the Swiss lake are the most unique and interesting specimens of Young America I came across during my foreign tramping .
Parsing [sent. 4905 len. 11]: I have made honest portraits of them , not caricatures .
Parsing [sent. 4906 len. 42]: The Grandson of twenty-three referred to himself five or six times as an `` old traveler , '' and as many as three times -LRB- with a serene complacency which was maddening -RRB- as a `` man of the world . ''
Parsing [sent. 4907 len. 19]: There was something very delicious about his leaving Boston to her `` narrowness , '' unreproved and uninstructed .
Parsing [sent. 4908 len. 31]: I formed the caravan in marching order , presently , and after riding down the line to see that it was properly roped together , gave the command to proceed .
Parsing [sent. 4909 len. 14]: In a little while the road carried us to open , grassy land .
Parsing [sent. 4910 len. 29]: We were above the troublesome forest , now , and had an uninterrupted view , straight before us , of our summit -- the summit of the Riffelberg .
Parsing [sent. 4911 len. 48]: We followed the mule-road , a zigzag course , now to the right , now to the left , but always up , and always crowded and incommoded by going and coming files of reckless tourists who were never , in a single instance , tied together .
Parsing [sent. 4912 len. 42]: I was obliged to exert the utmost care and caution , for in many places the road was not two yards wide , and often the lower side of it sloped away in slanting precipices eight and even nine feet deep .
Parsing [sent. 4913 len. 19]: I had to encourage the men constantly , to keep them from giving way to their unmanly fears .
Parsing [sent. 4914 len. 21]: We might have made the summit before night , but for a delay caused by the loss of an umbrella .
Parsing [sent. 4915 len. 50]: I was allowing the umbrella to remain lost , but the men murmured , and with reason , for in this exposed region we stood in peculiar need of protection against avalanches ; so I went into camp and detached a strong party to go after the missing article .
Parsing [sent. 4916 len. 21]: The difficulties of the next morning were severe , but our courage was high , for our goal was near .
Parsing [sent. 4917 len. 32]: At noon we conquered the last impediment -- we stood at last upon the summit , and without the loss of a single man except the mule that ate the glycerin .
Parsing [sent. 4918 len. 37]: Our great achievement was achieved -- the possibility of the impossible was demonstrated , and Harris and I walked proudly into the great dining-room of the Riffelberg Hotel and stood our alpenstocks up in the corner .
Parsing [sent. 4919 len. 21]: Yes , I had made the grand ascent ; but it was a mistake to do it in evening dress .
Parsing [sent. 4920 len. 26]: The plug hats were battered , the swallow-tails were fluttering rags , mud added no grace , the general effect was unpleasant and even disreputable .
Parsing [sent. 4921 len. 32]: There were about seventy-five tourists at the hotel -- mainly ladies and little children -- and they gave us an admiring welcome which paid us for all our privations and sufferings .
Parsing [sent. 4922 len. 27]: The ascent had been made , and the names and dates now stand recorded on a stone monument there to prove it to all future tourists .
Parsing [sent. 4923 len. 35]: I boiled a thermometer and took an altitude , with a most curious result : THE SUMMIT WAS NOT AS HIGH AS THE POINT ON THE MOUNTAINSIDE WHERE I HAD TAKEN THE FIRST ALTITUDE .
Parsing [sent. 4924 len. 15]: Suspecting that I had made an important discovery , I prepared to verify it .
Parsing [sent. 4925 len. 53]: There happened to be a still higher summit -LRB- called the Gorner Grat -RRB- , above the hotel , and notwithstanding the fact that it overlooks a glacier from a dizzy height , and that the ascent is difficult and dangerous , I resolved to venture up there and boil a thermometer .
Parsing [sent. 4926 len. 42]: So I sent a strong party , with some borrowed hoes , in charge of two chiefs of service , to dig a stairway in the soil all the way up , and this I ascended , roped to the guides .
Parsing [sent. 4927 len. 21]: This breezy height was the summit proper -- so I accomplished even more than I had originally purposed to do .
Parsing [sent. 4928 len. 10]: This foolhardy exploit is recorded on another stone monument .
Parsing [sent. 4929 len. 36]: I boiled my thermometer , and sure enough , this spot , which purported to be two thousand feet higher than the locality of the hotel , turned out to be nine thousand feet LOWER .
Parsing [sent. 4930 len. 27]: Thus the fact was clearly demonstrated that , ABOVE A CERTAIN POINT , THE HIGHER A POINT SEEMS TO BE , THE LOWER IT ACTUALLY IS .
Parsing [sent. 4931 len. 19]: Our ascent itself was a great achievement , but this contribution to science was an inconceivably greater matter .
Parsing [sent. 4932 len. 24]: Cavilers object that water boils at a lower and lower temperature the higher and higher you go , and hence the apparent anomaly .
Parsing [sent. 4933 len. 24]: I answer that I do not base my theory upon what the boiling water does , but upon what a boiled thermometer says .
Parsing [sent. 4934 len. 8]: You ca n't go behind the thermometer .
Parsing [sent. 4935 len. 24]: I had a magnificent view of Monte Rosa , and apparently all the rest of the Alpine world , from that high place .
Parsing [sent. 4936 len. 15]: All the circling horizon was piled high with a mighty tumult of snowy crests .
Parsing [sent. 4937 len. 18]: One might have imagined he saw before him the tented camps of a beleaguering host of Brobdingnagians .
Parsing [sent. 4938 len. 2]: NOTE .
Parsing [sent. 4939 len. 21]: -- I had the very unusual luck to catch one little momentary glimpse of the Matterhorn wholly unencumbered by clouds .
Parsing [sent. 4940 len. 28]: I leveled my photographic apparatus at it without the loss of an instant , and should have got an elegant picture if my donkey had not interfered .
Parsing [sent. 4941 len. 42]: It was my purpose to draw this photograph all by myself for my book , but was obliged to put the mountain part of it into the hands of the professional artist because I found I could not do landscape well .
Parsing [sent. 4942 len. 17]: But lonely , conspicuous , and superb , rose that wonderful upright wedge , the Matterhorn .
Parsing [sent. 4943 len. 38]: Its precipitous sides were powdered over with snow , and the upper half hidden in thick clouds which now and then dissolved to cobweb films and gave brief glimpses of the imposing tower as through a veil .
Parsing [sent. 4944 len. 64]: A little later the Matterhorn took to himself the semblance of a volcano ; he was stripped naked to his apex -- around this circled vast wreaths of white cloud which strung slowly out and streamed away slantwise toward the sun , a twenty-mile stretch of rolling and tumbling vapor , and looking just as if it were pouring out of a crater .
Parsing [sent. 4945 len. 49]: Later again , one of the mountain 's sides was clean and clear , and another side densely clothed from base to summit in thick smokelike cloud which feathered off and flew around the shaft 's sharp edge like the smoke around the corners of a burning building .
Parsing [sent. 4946 len. 15]: The Matterhorn is always experimenting , and always gets up fine effects , too .
Parsing [sent. 4947 len. 29]: In the sunset , when all the lower world is palled in gloom , it points toward heaven out of the pervading blackness like a finger of fire .
Parsing [sent. 4948 len. 16]: In the sunrise -- well , they say it is very fine in the sunrise .
Parsing [sent. 4949 len. 40]: Authorities agree that there is no such tremendous `` layout '' of snowy Alpine magnitude , grandeur , and sublimity to be seen from any other accessible point as the tourist may see from the summit of the Riffelberg .
Parsing [sent. 4950 len. 31]: Therefore , let the tourist rope himself up and go there ; for I have shown that with nerve , caution , and judgment , the thing can be done .
Parsing [sent. 4951 len. 30]: I wish to add one remark , here -- in parentheses , so to speak -- suggested by the word `` snowy , '' which I have just used .
Parsing [sent. 4952 len. 29]: We have all seen hills and mountains and levels with snow on them , and so we think we know all the aspects and effects produced by snow .
Parsing [sent. 4953 len. 12]: But indeed we do not until we have seen the Alps .
Parsing [sent. 4954 len. 15]: Possibly mass and distance add something -- at any rate , something IS added .
Parsing [sent. 4955 len. 38]: Among other noticeable things , there is a dazzling , intense whiteness about the distant Alpine snow , when the sun is on it , which one recognizes as peculiar , and not familiar to the eye .
Parsing [sent. 4956 len. 41]: The snow which one is accustomed to has a tint to it -- painters usually give it a bluish cast -- but there is no perceptible tint to the distant Alpine snow when it is trying to look its whitest .
Parsing [sent. 4957 len. 23]: As to the unimaginable splendor of it when the sun is blazing down on it -- well , it simply IS unimaginable .
Parsing [sent. 4958 len. 15]: CHAPTER XXXIX -LSB- We Travel by Glacier -RSB- A guide-book is a queer thing .
Parsing [sent. 4959 len. 22]: The reader has just seen what a man who undertakes the great ascent from Zermatt to the Riffelberg Hotel must experience .
Parsing [sent. 4960 len. 12]: Yet Baedeker makes these strange statements concerning this matter : 1 .
Parsing [sent. 4961 len. 5]: Distance -- 3 hours .
Parsing [sent. 4962 len. 2]: 2 .
Parsing [sent. 4963 len. 7]: The road can not be mistaken .
Parsing [sent. 4964 len. 2]: 3 .
Parsing [sent. 4965 len. 3]: Guide unnecessary .
Parsing [sent. 4966 len. 2]: 4 .
Parsing [sent. 4967 len. 15]: Distance from Riffelberg Hotel to the Gorner Grat , one hour and a half .
Parsing [sent. 4968 len. 2]: 5 .
Parsing [sent. 4969 len. 5]: Ascent simple and easy .
Parsing [sent. 4970 len. 3]: Guide unnecessary .
Parsing [sent. 4971 len. 2]: 6 .
Parsing [sent. 4972 len. 9]: Elevation of Zermatt above sea-level , 5,315 feet .
Parsing [sent. 4973 len. 2]: 7 .
Parsing [sent. 4974 len. 10]: Elevation of Riffelberg Hotel above sea-level , 8,429 feet .
Parsing [sent. 4975 len. 2]: 8 .
Parsing [sent. 4976 len. 11]: Elevation of the Gorner Grat above sea-level , 10,289 feet .
Parsing [sent. 4977 len. 17]: I have pretty effectually throttled these errors by sending him the following demonstrated facts : 1 .
Parsing [sent. 4978 len. 10]: Distance from Zermatt to Riffelberg Hotel , 7 days .
Parsing [sent. 4979 len. 2]: 2 .
Parsing [sent. 4980 len. 6]: The road CAN be mistaken .
Parsing [sent. 4981 len. 18]: If I am the first that did it , I want the credit of it , too .
Parsing [sent. 4982 len. 2]: 3 .
Parsing [sent. 4983 len. 14]: Guides ARE necessary , for none but a native can read those finger-boards .
Parsing [sent. 4984 len. 2]: 4 .
Parsing [sent. 4985 len. 18]: The estimate of the elevation of the several localities above sea-level is pretty correct -- for Baedeker .
Parsing [sent. 4986 len. 14]: He only misses it about a hundred and eighty or ninety thousand feet .
Parsing [sent. 4987 len. 6]: I found my arnica invaluable .
Parsing [sent. 4988 len. 15]: My men were suffering excruciatingly , from the friction of sitting down so much .
Parsing [sent. 4989 len. 40]: During two or three days , not one of them was able to do more than lie down or walk about ; yet so effective was the arnica , that on the fourth all were able to sit up .
Parsing [sent. 4990 len. 23]: I consider that , more than to anything else , I owe the success of our great undertaking to arnica and paregoric .
Parsing [sent. 4991 len. 26]: My men are being restored to health and strength , my main perplexity , now , was how to get them down the mountain again .
Parsing [sent. 4992 len. 28]: I was not willing to expose the brave fellows to the perils , fatigues , and hardships of that fearful route again if it could be helped .
Parsing [sent. 4993 len. 25]: First I thought of balloons ; but , of course , I had to give that idea up , for balloons were not procurable .
Parsing [sent. 4994 len. 16]: I thought of several other expedients , but upon consideration discarded them , for cause .
Parsing [sent. 4995 len. 7]: But at last I hit it .
Parsing [sent. 4996 len. 35]: I was aware that the movement of glaciers is an established fact , for I had read it in Baedeker ; so I resolved to take passage for Zermatt on the great Gorner Glacier .
Parsing [sent. 4997 len. 3]: Very good .
Parsing [sent. 4998 len. 27]: The next thing was , how to get down the glacier comfortably -- for the mule-road to it was long , and winding , and wearisome .
Parsing [sent. 4999 len. 14]: I set my mind at work , and soon thought out a plan .
Parsing [sent. 5000 len. 27]: One looks straight down upon the vast frozen river called the Gorner Glacier , from the Gorner Grat , a sheer precipice twelve hundred feet high .
Parsing [sent. 5001 len. 17]: We had one hundred and fifty-four umbrellas -- and what is an umbrella but a parachute ?
Parsing [sent. 5002 len. 57]: I mentioned this noble idea to Harris , with enthusiasm , and was about to order the Expedition to form on the Gorner Grat , with their umbrellas , and prepare for flight by platoons , each platoon in command of a guide , when Harris stopped me and urged me not to be too hasty .
Parsing [sent. 5003 len. 16]: He asked me if this method of descending the Alps had ever been tried before .
Parsing [sent. 5004 len. 12]: I said no , I had not heard of an instance .
Parsing [sent. 5005 len. 53]: Then , in his opinion , it was a matter of considerable gravity ; in his opinion it would not be well to send the whole command over the cliff at once ; a better way would be to send down a single individual , first , and see how he fared .
Parsing [sent. 5006 len. 9]: I saw the wisdom in this idea instantly .
Parsing [sent. 5007 len. 52]: I said as much , and thanked my agent cordially , and told him to take his umbrella and try the thing right away , and wave his hat when he got down , if he struck in a soft place , and then I would ship the rest right along .
Parsing [sent. 5008 len. 100]: Harris was greatly touched with this mark of confidence , and said so , in a voice that had a perceptible tremble in it ; but at the same time he said he did not feel himself worthy of so conspicuous a favor ; that it might cause jealousy in the command , for there were plenty who would not hesitate to say he had used underhanded means to get the appointment , whereas his conscience would bear him witness that he had not sought it at all , nor even , in his secret heart , desired it .
Parsing [sent. 5009 len. 41]: I said these words did him extreme credit , but that he must not throw away the imperishable distinction of being the first man to descend an Alp per parachute , simply to save the feelings of some envious underlings .
Parsing [sent. 5010 len. 23]: No , I said , he MUST accept the appointment -- it was no longer an invitation , it was a command .
Parsing [sent. 5011 len. 19]: He thanked me with effusion , and said that putting the thing in this form removed every objection .
Parsing [sent. 5012 len. 22]: He retired , and soon returned with his umbrella , his eye flaming with gratitude and his cheeks pallid with joy .
Parsing [sent. 5013 len. 8]: Just then the head guide passed along .
Parsing [sent. 5014 len. 58]: Harris 's expression changed to one of infinite tenderness , and he said : `` That man did me a cruel injury four days ago , and I said in my heart he should live to perceive and confess that the only noble revenge a man can take upon his enemy is to return good for evil .
Parsing [sent. 5015 len. 6]: I resign in his favor .
Parsing [sent. 5016 len. 4]: Appoint him . ''
Parsing [sent. 5017 len. 22]: I threw my arms around the generous fellow and said : `` Harris , you are the noblest soul that lives .
Parsing [sent. 5018 len. 18]: You shall not regret this sublime act , neither shall the world fail to know of it .
Parsing [sent. 5019 len. 19]: You shall have opportunity far transcending this one , too , if I live -- remember that . ''
Parsing [sent. 5020 len. 14]: I called the head guide to me and appointed him on the spot .
Parsing [sent. 5021 len. 9]: But the thing aroused no enthusiasm in him .
Parsing [sent. 5022 len. 10]: He did not take to the idea at all .
Parsing [sent. 5023 len. 16]: He said : `` Tie myself to an umbrella and jump over the Gorner Grat !
Parsing [sent. 5024 len. 17]: Excuse me , there are a great many pleasanter roads to the devil than that . ''
Parsing [sent. 5025 len. 21]: Upon a discussion of the subject with him , it appeared that he considered the project distinctly and decidedly dangerous .
Parsing [sent. 5026 len. 36]: I was not convinced , yet I was not willing to try the experiment in any risky way -- that is , in a way that might cripple the strength and efficiency of the Expedition .
Parsing [sent. 5027 len. 20]: I was about at my wits ' end when it occurred to me to try it on the Latinist .
Parsing [sent. 5028 len. 5]: He was called in .
Parsing [sent. 5029 len. 26]: But he declined , on the plea of inexperience , diffidence in public , lack of curiosity , and I did n't know what all .
Parsing [sent. 5030 len. 19]: Another man declined on account of a cold in the head ; thought he ought to avoid exposure .
Parsing [sent. 5031 len. 25]: Another could not jump well -- never COULD jump well -- did not believe he could jump so far without long and patient practice .
Parsing [sent. 5032 len. 18]: Another was afraid it was going to rain , and his umbrella had a hole in it .
Parsing [sent. 5033 len. 5]: Everybody had an excuse .
Parsing [sent. 5034 len. 39]: The result was what the reader has by this time guessed : the most magnificent idea that was ever conceived had to be abandoned , from sheer lack of a person with enterprise enough to carry it out .
Parsing [sent. 5035 len. 29]: Yes , I actually had to give that thing up -- while doubtless I should live to see somebody use it and take all the credit from me .
Parsing [sent. 5036 len. 14]: Well , I had to go overland -- there was no other way .
Parsing [sent. 5037 len. 37]: I marched the Expedition down the steep and tedious mule-path and took up as good a position as I could upon the middle of the glacier -- because Baedeker said the middle part travels the fastest .
Parsing [sent. 5038 len. 26]: As a measure of economy , however , I put some of the heavier baggage on the shoreward parts , to go as slow freight .
Parsing [sent. 5039 len. 12]: I waited and waited , but the glacier did not move .
Parsing [sent. 5040 len. 17]: Night was coming on , the darkness began to gather -- still we did not budge .
Parsing [sent. 5041 len. 27]: It occurred to me then , that there might be a time-table in Baedeker ; it would be well to find out the hours of starting .
Parsing [sent. 5042 len. 12]: I called for the book -- it could not be found .
Parsing [sent. 5043 len. 14]: Bradshaw would certainly contain a time-table ; but no Bradshaw could be found .
Parsing [sent. 5044 len. 12]: Very well , I must make the best of the situation .
Parsing [sent. 5045 len. 45]: So I pitched the tents , picketed the animals , milked the cows , had supper , paregoricked the men , established the watch , and went to bed -- with orders to call me as soon as we came in sight of Zermatt .
Parsing [sent. 5046 len. 13]: I awoke about half past ten next morning , and looked around .
Parsing [sent. 5047 len. 7]: We had n't budged a peg !
Parsing [sent. 5048 len. 21]: At first I could not understand it ; then it occurred to me that the old thing must be aground .
Parsing [sent. 5049 len. 33]: So I cut down some trees and rigged a spar on the starboard and another on the port side , and fooled away upward of three hours trying to spar her off .
Parsing [sent. 5050 len. 6]: But it was no use .
Parsing [sent. 5051 len. 24]: She was half a mile wide and fifteen or twenty miles long , and there was no telling just whereabouts she WAS aground .
Parsing [sent. 5052 len. 27]: The men began to show uneasiness , too , and presently they came flying to me with ashy faces , saying she had sprung a leak .
Parsing [sent. 5053 len. 15]: Nothing but my cool behavior at this critical time saved us from another panic .
Parsing [sent. 5054 len. 9]: I ordered them to show me the place .
Parsing [sent. 5055 len. 21]: They led me to a spot where a huge boulder lay in a deep pool of clear and brilliant water .
Parsing [sent. 5056 len. 16]: It did look like a pretty bad leak , but I kept that to myself .
Parsing [sent. 5057 len. 16]: I made a pump and set the men to work to pump out the glacier .
Parsing [sent. 5058 len. 7]: We made a success of it .
Parsing [sent. 5059 len. 14]: I perceived , then , that it was not a leak at all .
Parsing [sent. 5060 len. 67]: This boulder had descended from a precipice and stopped on the ice in the middle of the glacier , and the sun had warmed it up , every day , and consequently it had melted its way deeper and deeper into the ice , until at last it reposed , as we had found it , in a deep pool of the clearest and coldest water .
Parsing [sent. 5061 len. 14]: Presently Baedeker was found again , and I hunted eagerly for the time-table .
Parsing [sent. 5062 len. 4]: There was none .
Parsing [sent. 5063 len. 12]: The book simply said the glacier was moving all the time .
Parsing [sent. 5064 len. 24]: This was satisfactory , so I shut up the book and chose a good position to view the scenery as we passed along .
Parsing [sent. 5065 len. 29]: I stood there some time enjoying the trip , but at last it occurred to me that we did not seem to be gaining any on the scenery .
Parsing [sent. 5066 len. 35]: I said to myself , `` This confounded old thing 's aground again , sure , '' -- and opened Baedeker to see if I could run across any remedy for these annoying interruptions .
Parsing [sent. 5067 len. 14]: I soon found a sentence which threw a dazzling light upon the matter .
Parsing [sent. 5068 len. 23]: It said , `` The Gorner Glacier travels at an average rate of a little less than an inch a day . ''
Parsing [sent. 5069 len. 7]: I have seldom felt so outraged .
Parsing [sent. 5070 len. 10]: I have seldom had my confidence so wantonly betrayed .
Parsing [sent. 5071 len. 27]: I made a small calculation : One inch a day , say thirty feet a year ; estimated distance to Zermatt , three and one-eighteenth miles .
Parsing [sent. 5072 len. 14]: Time required to go by glacier , A LITTLE OVER FIVE HUNDRED YEARS !
Parsing [sent. 5073 len. 29]: I said to myself , `` I can WALK it quicker -- and before I will patronize such a fraud as this , I will do it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5074 len. 71]: When I revealed to Harris the fact that the passenger part of this glacier -- the central part -- the lightning-express part , so to speak -- was not due in Zermatt till the summer of 2378 , and that the baggage , coming along the slow edge , would not arrive until some generations later , he burst out with : `` That is European management , all over !
Parsing [sent. 5075 len. 9]: An inch a day -- think of that !
Parsing [sent. 5076 len. 11]: Five hundred years to go a trifle over three miles !
Parsing [sent. 5077 len. 8]: But I am not a bit surprised .
Parsing [sent. 5078 len. 6]: It 's a Catholic glacier .
Parsing [sent. 5079 len. 9]: You can tell by the look of it .
Parsing [sent. 5080 len. 5]: And the management . ''
Parsing [sent. 5081 len. 20]: I said , no , I believed nothing but the extreme end of it was in a Catholic canton .
Parsing [sent. 5082 len. 15]: `` Well , then , it 's a government glacier , '' said Harris .
Parsing [sent. 5083 len. 7]: `` It 's all the same .
Parsing [sent. 5084 len. 17]: Over here the government runs everything -- so everything 's slow ; slow , and ill-managed .
Parsing [sent. 5085 len. 26]: But with us , everything 's done by private enterprise -- and then there ai n't much lolling around , you can depend on it .
Parsing [sent. 5086 len. 27]: I wish Tom Scott could get his hands on this torpid old slab once -- you 'd see it take a different gait from this . ''
Parsing [sent. 5087 len. 20]: I said I was sure he would increase the speed , if there was trade enough to justify it .
Parsing [sent. 5088 len. 10]: `` He 'd MAKE trade , '' said Harris .
Parsing [sent. 5089 len. 10]: `` That 's the difference between governments and individuals .
Parsing [sent. 5090 len. 8]: Governments do n't care , individuals do .
Parsing [sent. 5091 len. 38]: Tom Scott would take all the trade ; in two years Gorner stock would go to two hundred , and inside of two more you would see all the other glaciers under the hammer for taxes . ''
Parsing [sent. 5092 len. 28]: After a reflective pause , Harris added , `` A little less than an inch a day ; a little less than an INCH , mind you .
Parsing [sent. 5093 len. 11]: Well , I 'm losing my reverence for glaciers . ''
Parsing [sent. 5094 len. 9]: I was feeling much the same way myself .
Parsing [sent. 5095 len. 38]: I have traveled by canal-boat , ox-wagon , raft , and by the Ephesus and Smyrna railway ; but when it comes down to good solid honest slow motion , I bet my money on the glacier .
Parsing [sent. 5096 len. 29]: As a means of passenger transportation , I consider the glacier a failure ; but as a vehicle of slow freight , I think she fills the bill .
Parsing [sent. 5097 len. 23]: In the matter of putting the fine shades on that line of business , I judge she could teach the Germans something .
Parsing [sent. 5098 len. 16]: I ordered the men to break camp and prepare for the land journey to Zermatt .
Parsing [sent. 5099 len. 84]: At this moment a most interesting find was made ; a dark object , bedded in the glacial ice , was cut out with the ice-axes , and it proved to be a piece of the undressed skin of some animal -- a hair trunk , perhaps ; but a close inspection disabled the hair-trunk theory , and further discussion and examination exploded it entirely -- that is , in the opinion of all the scientists except the one who had advanced it .
Parsing [sent. 5100 len. 91]: This one clung to his theory with affectionate fidelity characteristic of originators of scientific theories , and afterward won many of the first scientists of the age to his view , by a very able pamphlet which he wrote , entitled , `` Evidences going to show that the hair trunk , in a wild state , belonged to the early glacial period , and roamed the wastes of chaos in the company with the cave-bear , primeval man , and the other Ooelitics of the Old Silurian family . ''
Parsing [sent. 5101 len. 26]: Each of our scientists had a theory of his own , and put forward an animal of his own as a candidate for the skin .
Parsing [sent. 5102 len. 96]: I sided with the geologist of the Expedition in the belief that this patch of skin had once helped to cover a Siberian elephant , in some old forgotten age -- but we divided there , the geologist believing that this discovery proved that Siberia had formerly been located where Switzerland is now , whereas I held the opinion that it merely proved that the primeval Swiss was not the dull savage he is represented to have been , but was a being of high intellectual development , who liked to go to the menagerie .
Parsing [sent. 5103 len. 52]: We arrived that evening , after many hardships and adventures , in some fields close to the great ice-arch where the mad Visp boils and surges out from under the foot of the great Gorner Glacier , and here we camped , our perils over and our magnificent undertaking successfully completed .
Parsing [sent. 5104 len. 19]: We marched into Zermatt the next day , and were received with the most lavish honors and applause .
Parsing [sent. 5105 len. 30]: A document , signed and sealed by the authorities , was given to me which established and endorsed the fact that I had made the ascent of the Riffelberg .
Parsing [sent. 5106 len. 20]: This I wear around my neck , and it will be buried with me when I am no more .
Parsing [sent. 5107 len. 31]: CHAPTER XL -LSB- Piteous Relics at Chamonix -RSB- I am not so ignorant about glacial movement , now , as I was when I took passage on the Gorner Glacier .
Parsing [sent. 5108 len. 8]: I have `` read up '' since .
Parsing [sent. 5109 len. 59]: I am aware that these vast bodies of ice do not travel at the same rate of speed ; while the Gorner Glacier makes less than an inch a day , the Unter-Aar Glacier makes as much as eight ; and still other glaciers are said to go twelve , sixteen , and even twenty inches a day .
Parsing [sent. 5110 len. 19]: One writer says that the slowest glacier travels twenty-five feet a year , and the fastest four hundred .
Parsing [sent. 5111 len. 5]: What is a glacier ?
Parsing [sent. 5112 len. 24]: It is easy to say it looks like a frozen river which occupies the bed of a winding gorge or gully between mountains .
Parsing [sent. 5113 len. 9]: But that gives no notion of its vastness .
Parsing [sent. 5114 len. 57]: For it is sometimes six hundred feet thick , and we are not accustomed to rivers six hundred feet deep ; no , our rivers are six feet , twenty feet , and sometimes fifty feet deep ; we are not quite able to grasp so large a fact as an ice-river six hundred feet deep .
Parsing [sent. 5115 len. 68]: The glacier 's surface is not smooth and level , but has deep swales and swelling elevations , and sometimes has the look of a tossing sea whose turbulent billows were frozen hard in the instant of their most violent motion ; the glacier 's surface is not a flawless mass , but is a river with cracks or crevices , some narrow , some gaping wide .
Parsing [sent. 5116 len. 24]: Many a man , the victim of a slip or a misstep , has plunged down one of these and met his death .
Parsing [sent. 5117 len. 41]: Men have been fished out of them alive ; but it was when they did not go to a great depth ; the cold of the great depths would quickly stupefy a man , whether he was hurt or unhurt .
Parsing [sent. 5118 len. 60]: These cracks do not go straight down ; one can seldom see more than twenty to forty feet down them ; consequently men who have disappeared in them have been sought for , in the hope that they had stopped within helping distance , whereas their case , in most instances , had really been hopeless from the beginning .
Parsing [sent. 5119 len. 52]: In 1864 a party of tourists was descending Mont Blanc , and while picking their way over one of the mighty glaciers of that lofty region , roped together , as was proper , a young porter disengaged himself from the line and started across an ice-bridge which spanned a crevice .
Parsing [sent. 5120 len. 12]: It broke under him with a crash , and he disappeared .
Parsing [sent. 5121 len. 22]: The others could not see how deep he had gone , so it might be worthwhile to try and rescue him .
Parsing [sent. 5122 len. 9]: A brave young guide named Michel Payot volunteered .
Parsing [sent. 5123 len. 32]: Two ropes were made fast to his leather belt and he bore the end of a third one in his hand to tie to the victim in case he found him .
Parsing [sent. 5124 len. 33]: He was lowered into the crevice , he descended deeper and deeper between the clear blue walls of solid ice , he approached a bend in the crack and disappeared under it .
Parsing [sent. 5125 len. 44]: Down , and still down , he went , into this profound grave ; when he had reached a depth of eighty feet he passed under another bend in the crack , and thence descended eighty feet lower , as between perpendicular precipices .
Parsing [sent. 5126 len. 50]: Arrived at this stage of one hundred and sixty feet below the surface of the glacier , he peered through the twilight dimness and perceived that the chasm took another turn and stretched away at a steep slant to unknown deeps , for its course was lost in darkness .
Parsing [sent. 5127 len. 17]: What a place that was to be in -- especially if that leather belt should break !
Parsing [sent. 5128 len. 29]: The compression of the belt threatened to suffocate the intrepid fellow ; he called to his friends to draw him up , but could not make them hear .
Parsing [sent. 5129 len. 9]: They still lowered him , deeper and deeper .
Parsing [sent. 5130 len. 27]: Then he jerked his third cord as vigorously as he could ; his friends understood , and dragged him out of those icy jaws of death .
Parsing [sent. 5131 len. 22]: Then they attached a bottle to a cord and sent it down two hundred feet , but it found no bottom .
Parsing [sent. 5132 len. 32]: It came up covered with congelations -- evidence enough that even if the poor porter reached the bottom with unbroken bones , a swift death from cold was sure , anyway .
Parsing [sent. 5133 len. 11]: A glacier is a stupendous , ever-progressing , resistless plow .
Parsing [sent. 5134 len. 37]: It pushes ahead of it masses of boulders which are packed together , and they stretch across the gorge , right in front of it , like a long grave or a long , sharp roof .
Parsing [sent. 5135 len. 6]: This is called a moraine .
Parsing [sent. 5136 len. 13]: It also shoves out a moraine along each side of its course .
Parsing [sent. 5137 len. 19]: Imposing as the modern glaciers are , they are not so huge as were some that once existed .
Parsing [sent. 5138 len. 61]: For instance , Mr. Whymper says : `` At some very remote period the Valley of Aosta was occupied by a vast glacier , which flowed down its entire length from Mont Blanc to the plain of Piedmont , remained stationary , or nearly so , at its mouth for many centuries , and deposited there enormous masses of debris .
Parsing [sent. 5139 len. 29]: The length of this glacier exceeded EIGHTY MILES , and it drained a basin twenty-five to thirty-five miles across , bounded by the highest mountains in the Alps .
Parsing [sent. 5140 len. 52]: `` The great peaks rose several thousand feet above the glaciers , and then , as now , shattered by sun and frost , poured down their showers of rocks and stones , in witness of which there are the immense piles of angular fragments that constitute the moraines of Ivrea .
Parsing [sent. 5141 len. 10]: `` The moraines around Ivrea are of extraordinary dimensions .
Parsing [sent. 5142 len. 39]: That which was on the left bank of the glacier is about THIRTEEN MILES long , and in some places rises to a height of TWO THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY FEET above the floor of the valley !
Parsing [sent. 5143 len. 23]: The terminal moraines -LRB- those which are pushed in front of the glaciers -RRB- cover something like twenty square miles of country .
Parsing [sent. 5144 len. 38]: At the mouth of the Valley of Aosta , the thickness of the glacier must have been at least TWO THOUSAND feet , and its width , at that part , FIVE MILES AND A QUARTER . ''
Parsing [sent. 5145 len. 17]: It is not easy to get at a comprehension of a mass of ice like that .
Parsing [sent. 5146 len. 71]: If one could cleave off the butt end of such a glacier -- an oblong block two or three miles wide by five and a quarter long and two thousand feet thick -- he could completely hide the city of New York under it , and Trinity steeple would only stick up into it relatively as far as a shingle-nail would stick up into the bottom of a Saratoga trunk .
Parsing [sent. 5147 len. 29]: `` The boulders from Mont Blanc , upon the plain below Ivrea , assure us that the glacier which transported them existed for a prodigious length of time .
Parsing [sent. 5148 len. 44]: Their present distance from the cliffs from which they were derived is about 420,000 feet , and if we assume that they traveled at the rate of 400 feet per annum , their journey must have occupied them no less than 1,055 years !
Parsing [sent. 5149 len. 11]: In all probability they did not travel so fast . ''
Parsing [sent. 5150 len. 10]: Glaciers are sometimes hurried out of their characteristic snail-pace .
Parsing [sent. 5151 len. 7]: A marvelous spectacle is presented then .
Parsing [sent. 5152 len. 81]: Mr. Whymper refers to a case which occurred in Iceland in 1721 : `` It seems that in the neighborhood of the mountain Kotlugja , large bodies of water formed underneath , or within the glaciers -LRB- either on account of the interior heat of the earth , or from other causes -RRB- , and at length acquired irresistible power , tore the glaciers from their mooring on the land , and swept them over every obstacle into the sea .
Parsing [sent. 5153 len. 52]: Prodigious masses of ice were thus borne for a distance of about ten miles over land in the space of a few hours ; and their bulk was so enormous that they covered the sea for seven miles from the shore , and remained aground in six hundred feet of water !
Parsing [sent. 5154 len. 11]: The denudation of the land was upon a grand scale .
Parsing [sent. 5155 len. 13]: All superficial accumulations were swept away , and the bedrock was exposed .
Parsing [sent. 5156 len. 44]: It was described , in graphic language , how all irregularities and depressions were obliterated , and a smooth surface of several miles ' area laid bare , and that this area had the appearance of having been PLANED BY A PLANE . ''
Parsing [sent. 5157 len. 39]: The account translated from the Icelandic says that the mountainlike ruins of this majestic glacier so covered the sea that as far as the eye could reach no open water was discoverable , even from the highest peaks .
Parsing [sent. 5158 len. 95]: A monster wall or barrier of ice was built across a considerable stretch of land , too , by this strange irruption : `` One can form some idea of the altitude of this barrier of ice when it is mentioned that from Hofdabrekka farm , which lies high up on a fjeld , one could not see Hjorleifshofdi opposite , which is a fell six hundred and forty feet in height ; but in order to do so had to clamber up a mountain slope east of Hofdabrekka twelve hundred feet high . ''
Parsing [sent. 5159 len. 28]: These things will help the reader to understand why it is that a man who keeps company with glaciers comes to feel tolerably insignificant by and by .
Parsing [sent. 5160 len. 51]: The Alps and the glaciers together are able to take every bit of conceit out of a man and reduce his self-importance to zero if he will only remain within the influence of their sublime presence long enough to give it a fair and reasonable chance to do its work .
Parsing [sent. 5161 len. 14]: The Alpine glaciers move -- that is granted , now , by everybody .
Parsing [sent. 5162 len. 37]: But there was a time when people scoffed at the idea ; they said you might as well expect leagues of solid rock to crawl along the ground as expect leagues of ice to do it .
Parsing [sent. 5163 len. 16]: But proof after proof was furnished , and the finally the world had to believe .
Parsing [sent. 5164 len. 16]: The wise men not only said the glacier moved , but they timed its movement .
Parsing [sent. 5165 len. 24]: They ciphered out a glacier 's gait , and then said confidently that it would travel just so far in so many years .
Parsing [sent. 5166 len. 20]: There is record of a striking and curious example of the accuracy which may be attained in these reckonings .
Parsing [sent. 5167 len. 20]: In 1820 the ascent of Mont Blanc was attempted by a Russian and two Englishmen , with seven guides .
Parsing [sent. 5168 len. 47]: They had reached a prodigious altitude , and were approaching the summit , when an avalanche swept several of the party down a sharp slope of two hundred feet and hurled five of them -LRB- all guides -RRB- into one of the crevices of a glacier .
Parsing [sent. 5169 len. 31]: The life of one of the five was saved by a long barometer which was strapped to his back -- it bridged the crevice and suspended him until help came .
Parsing [sent. 5170 len. 14]: The alpenstock or baton of another saved its owner in a similar way .
Parsing [sent. 5171 len. 15]: Three men were lost -- Pierre Balmat , Pierre Carrier , and Auguste Tairraz .
Parsing [sent. 5172 len. 14]: They had been hurled down into the fathomless great deeps of the crevice .
Parsing [sent. 5173 len. 32]: Dr. Forbes , the English geologist , had made frequent visits to the Mont Blanc region , and had given much attention to the disputed question of the movement of glaciers .
Parsing [sent. 5174 len. 56]: During one of these visits he completed his estimates of the rate of movement of the glacier which had swallowed up the three guides , and uttered the prediction that the glacier would deliver up its dead at the foot of the mountain thirty-five years from the time of the accident , or possibly forty .
Parsing [sent. 5175 len. 24]: A dull , slow journey -- a movement imperceptible to any eye -- but it was proceeding , nevertheless , and without cessation .
Parsing [sent. 5176 len. 30]: It was a journey which a rolling stone would make in a few seconds -- the lofty point of departure was visible from the village below in the valley .
Parsing [sent. 5177 len. 27]: The prediction cut curiously close to the truth ; forty-one years after the catastrophe , the remains were cast forth at the foot of the glacier .
Parsing [sent. 5178 len. 19]: I find an interesting account of the matter in the HISTOIRE DU MONT BLANC , by Stephen d'Arve .
Parsing [sent. 5179 len. 48]: I will condense this account , as follows : On the 12th of August , 1861 , at the hour of the close of mass , a guide arrived out of breath at the mairie of Chamonix , and bearing on his shoulders a very lugubrious burden .
Parsing [sent. 5180 len. 24]: It was a sack filled with human remains which he had gathered from the orifice of a crevice in the Glacier des Bossons .
Parsing [sent. 5181 len. 35]: He conjectured that these were remains of the victims of the catastrophe of 1820 , and a minute inquest , immediately instituted by the local authorities , soon demonstrated the correctness of his supposition .
Parsing [sent. 5182 len. 25]: The contents of the sack were spread upon a long table , and officially inventoried , as follows : Portions of three human skulls .
Parsing [sent. 5183 len. 8]: Several tufts of black and blonde hair .
Parsing [sent. 5184 len. 10]: A human jaw , furnished with fine white teeth .
Parsing [sent. 5185 len. 13]: A forearm and hand , all the fingers of the latter intact .
Parsing [sent. 5186 len. 22]: The flesh was white and fresh , and both the arm and hand preserved a degree of flexibility in the articulations .
Parsing [sent. 5187 len. 23]: The ring-finger had suffered a slight abrasion , and the stain of the blood was still visible and unchanged after forty-one years .
Parsing [sent. 5188 len. 10]: A left foot , the flesh white and fresh .
Parsing [sent. 5189 len. 60]: Along with these fragments were portions of waistcoats , hats , hobnailed shoes , and other clothing ; a wing of a pigeon , with black feathers ; a fragment of an alpenstock ; a tin lantern ; and lastly , a boiled leg of mutton , the only flesh among all the remains that exhaled an unpleasant odor .
Parsing [sent. 5190 len. 34]: The guide said that the mutton had no odor when he took it from the glacier ; an hour 's exposure to the sun had already begun the work of decomposition upon it .
Parsing [sent. 5191 len. 18]: Persons were called for , to identify these poor pathetic relics , and a touching scene ensued .
Parsing [sent. 5192 len. 36]: Two men were still living who had witnessed the grim catastrophe of nearly half a century before -- Marie Couttet -LRB- saved by his baton -RRB- and Julien Davouassoux -LRB- saved by the barometer -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 5193 len. 9]: These aged men entered and approached the table .
Parsing [sent. 5194 len. 46]: Davouassoux , more than eighty years old , contemplated the mournful remains mutely and with a vacant eye , for his intelligence and his memory were torpid with age ; but Couttet 's faculties were still perfect at seventy-two , and he exhibited strong emotion .
Parsing [sent. 5195 len. 15]: He said : `` Pierre Balmat was fair ; he wore a straw hat .
Parsing [sent. 5196 len. 20]: This bit of skull , with the tuft of blond hair , was his ; this is his hat .
Parsing [sent. 5197 len. 16]: Pierre Carrier was very dark ; this skull was his , and this felt hat .
Parsing [sent. 5198 len. 13]: This is Balmat 's hand , I remember it so well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5199 len. 65]: and the old man bent down and kissed it reverently , then closed his fingers upon it in an affectionate grasp , crying out , `` I could never have dared to believe that before quitting this world it would be granted me to press once more the hand of one of those brave comrades , the hand of my good friend Balmat . ''
Parsing [sent. 5200 len. 26]: There is something weirdly pathetic about the picture of that white-haired veteran greeting with his loving handshake this friend who had been dead forty years .
Parsing [sent. 5201 len. 62]: When these hands had met last , they were alike in the softness and freshness of youth ; now , one was brown and wrinkled and horny with age , while the other was still as young and fair and blemishless as if those forty years had come and gone in a single moment , leaving no mark of their passage .
Parsing [sent. 5202 len. 18]: Time had gone on , in the one case ; it had stood still in the other .
Parsing [sent. 5203 len. 48]: A man who has not seen a friend for a generation , keeps him in mind always as he saw him last , and is somehow surprised , and is also shocked , to see the aging change the years have wrought when he sees him again .
Parsing [sent. 5204 len. 42]: Marie Couttet 's experience , in finding his friend 's hand unaltered from the image of it which he had carried in his memory for forty years , is an experience which stands alone in the history of man , perhaps .
Parsing [sent. 5205 len. 13]: Couttet identified other relics : `` This hat belonged to Auguste Tairraz .
Parsing [sent. 5206 len. 16]: He carried the cage of pigeons which we proposed to set free upon the summit .
Parsing [sent. 5207 len. 10]: Here is the wing of one of those pigeons .
Parsing [sent. 5208 len. 23]: And here is the fragment of my broken baton ; it was by grace of that baton that my life was saved .
Parsing [sent. 5209 len. 35]: Who could have told me that I should one day have the satisfaction to look again upon this bit of wood that supported me above the grave that swallowed up my unfortunate companions ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5210 len. 20]: No portions of the body of Tairraz , other than a piece of the skull , had been found .
Parsing [sent. 5211 len. 10]: A diligent search was made , but without result .
Parsing [sent. 5212 len. 16]: However , another search was instituted a year later , and this had better success .
Parsing [sent. 5213 len. 30]: Many fragments of clothing which had belonged to the lost guides were discovered ; also , part of a lantern , and a green veil with blood-stains on it .
Parsing [sent. 5214 len. 34]: But the interesting feature was this : One of the searchers came suddenly upon a sleeved arm projecting from a crevice in the ice-wall , with the hand outstretched as if offering greeting !
Parsing [sent. 5215 len. 32]: `` The nails of this white hand were still rosy , and the pose of the extended fingers seemed to express an eloquent welcome to the long-lost light of day . ''
Parsing [sent. 5216 len. 12]: The hand and arm were alone ; there was no trunk .
Parsing [sent. 5217 len. 23]: After being removed from the ice the flesh-tints quickly faded out and the rosy nails took on the alabaster hue of death .
Parsing [sent. 5218 len. 25]: This was the third RIGHT hand found ; therefore , all three of the lost men were accounted for , beyond cavil or question .
Parsing [sent. 5219 len. 21]: Dr. Hamel was the Russian gentleman of the party which made the ascent at the time of the famous disaster .
Parsing [sent. 5220 len. 49]: He left Chamonix as soon as he conveniently could after the descent ; and as he had shown a chilly indifference about the calamity , and offered neither sympathy nor assistance to the widows and orphans , he carried with him the cordial execrations of the whole community .
Parsing [sent. 5221 len. 50]: Four months before the first remains were found , a Chamonix guide named Balmat -- a relative of one of the lost men -- was in London , and one day encountered a hale old gentleman in the British Museum , who said : `` I overheard your name .
Parsing [sent. 5222 len. 9]: Are you from Chamonix , Monsieur Balmat ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5223 len. 6]: `` Yes , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 5224 len. 14]: `` Have n't they found the bodies of my three guides , yet ?
Parsing [sent. 5225 len. 6]: I am Dr. Hamel . ''
Parsing [sent. 5226 len. 8]: `` Alas , no , monsieur . ''
Parsing [sent. 5227 len. 13]: `` Well , you 'll find them , sooner or later . ''
Parsing [sent. 5228 len. 32]: `` Yes , it is the opinion of Dr. Forbes and Mr. Tyndall , that the glacier will sooner or later restore to us the remains of the unfortunate victims . ''
Parsing [sent. 5229 len. 9]: `` Without a doubt , without a doubt .
Parsing [sent. 5230 len. 17]: And it will be a great thing for Chamonix , in the matter of attracting tourists .
Parsing [sent. 5231 len. 14]: You can get up a museum with those remains that will draw ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5232 len. 19]: This savage idea has not improved the odor of Dr. Hamel 's name in Chamonix by any means .
Parsing [sent. 5233 len. 12]: But after all , the man was sound on human nature .
Parsing [sent. 5234 len. 21]: His idea was conveyed to the public officials of Chamonix , and they gravely discussed it around the official council-table .
Parsing [sent. 5235 len. 38]: They were only prevented from carrying it into execution by the determined opposition of the friends and descendants of the lost guides , who insisted on giving the remains Christian burial , and succeeded in their purpose .
Parsing [sent. 5236 len. 19]: A close watch had to be kept upon all the poor remnants and fragments , to prevent embezzlement .
Parsing [sent. 5237 len. 9]: A few accessory odds and ends were sold .
Parsing [sent. 5238 len. 51]: Rags and scraps of the coarse clothing were parted with at the rate equal to about twenty dollars a yard ; a piece of a lantern and one or two other trifles brought nearly their weight in gold ; and an Englishman offered a pound sterling for a single breeches-button .
Parsing [sent. 5239 len. 40]: CHAPTER XLI -LSB- The Fearful Disaster of 1865 -RSB- One of the most memorable of all the Alpine catastrophes was that of July , 1865 , on the Matterhorn -- already slightly referred to , a few pages back .
Parsing [sent. 5240 len. 10]: The details of it are scarcely known in America .
Parsing [sent. 5241 len. 13]: To the vast majority of readers they are not known at all .
Parsing [sent. 5242 len. 10]: Mr. Whymper 's account is the only authentic one .
Parsing [sent. 5243 len. 37]: I will import the chief portion of it into this book , partly because of its intrinsic interest , and partly because it gives such a vivid idea of what the perilous pastime of Alp-climbing is .
Parsing [sent. 5244 len. 32]: This was Mr. Whymper 's NINTH attempt during a series of years , to vanquish that steep and stubborn pillar or rock ; it succeeded , the other eight were failures .
Parsing [sent. 5245 len. 16]: No man had ever accomplished the ascent before , though the attempts had been numerous .
Parsing [sent. 5246 len. 27]: MR. WHYMPER 'S NARRATIVE We started from Zermatt on the 13th of July , at half past five , on a brilliant and perfectly cloudless morning .
Parsing [sent. 5247 len. 48]: We were eight in number -- Croz -LRB- guide -RRB- , old Peter Taugwalder -LRB- guide -RRB- and his two sons ; Lord F. Douglas , Mr. Hadow , Rev. Mr. Hudson , and I. To insure steady motion , one tourist and one native walked together .
Parsing [sent. 5248 len. 8]: The youngest Taugwalder fell to my share .
Parsing [sent. 5249 len. 39]: The wine-bags also fell to my lot to carry , and throughout the day , after each drink , I replenished them secretly with water , so that at the next halt they were found fuller than before !
Parsing [sent. 5250 len. 13]: This was considered a good omen , and little short of miraculous .
Parsing [sent. 5251 len. 24]: On the first day we did not intend to ascend to any great height , and we mounted , accordingly , very leisurely .
Parsing [sent. 5252 len. 21]: Before twelve o'clock we had found a good position for the tent , at a height of eleven thousand feet .
Parsing [sent. 5253 len. 40]: We passed the remaining hours of daylight -- some basking in the sunshine , some sketching , some collecting ; Hudson made tea , I coffee , and at length we retired , each one to his blanket bag .
Parsing [sent. 5254 len. 18]: We assembled together before dawn on the 14th and started directly it was light enough to move .
Parsing [sent. 5255 len. 9]: One of the young Taugwalders returned to Zermatt .
Parsing [sent. 5256 len. 22]: In a few minutes we turned the rib which had intercepted the view of the eastern face from our tent platform .
Parsing [sent. 5257 len. 21]: The whole of this great slope was now revealed , rising for three thousand feet like a huge natural staircase .
Parsing [sent. 5258 len. 46]: Some parts were more , and others were less easy , but we were not once brought to a halt by any serious impediment , for when an obstruction was met in front it could always be turned to the right or to the left .
Parsing [sent. 5259 len. 26]: For the greater part of the way there was no occasion , indeed , for the rope , and sometimes Hudson led , sometimes myself .
Parsing [sent. 5260 len. 47]: At six-twenty we had attained a height of twelve thousand eight hundred feet , and halted for half an hour ; we then continued the ascent without a break until nine-fifty-five , when we stopped for fifty minutes , at a height of fourteen thousand feet .
Parsing [sent. 5261 len. 22]: We had now arrived at the foot of that part which , seen from the Riffelberg , seems perpendicular or overhanging .
Parsing [sent. 5262 len. 10]: We could no longer continue on the eastern side .
Parsing [sent. 5263 len. 29]: For a little distance we ascended by snow upon the ARÊTE -- that is , the ridge -- then turned over to the right , or northern side .
Parsing [sent. 5264 len. 9]: The work became difficult , and required caution .
Parsing [sent. 5265 len. 47]: In some places there was little to hold ; the general slope of the mountain was LESS than forty degrees , and snow had accumulated in , and had filled up , the interstices of the rock-face , leaving only occasional fragments projecting here and there .
Parsing [sent. 5266 len. 12]: These were at times covered with a thin film of ice .
Parsing [sent. 5267 len. 13]: It was a place which any fair mountaineer might pass in safety .
Parsing [sent. 5268 len. 33]: We bore away nearly horizontally for about four hundred feet , then ascended directly toward the summit for about sixty feet , then doubled back to the ridge which descends toward Zermatt .
Parsing [sent. 5269 len. 15]: A long stride round a rather awkward corner brought us to snow once more .
Parsing [sent. 5270 len. 5]: That last doubt vanished !
Parsing [sent. 5271 len. 5]: The Matterhorn was ours !
Parsing [sent. 5272 len. 13]: Nothing but two hundred feet of easy snow remained to be surmounted .
Parsing [sent. 5273 len. 12]: The higher we rose , the more intense became the excitement .
Parsing [sent. 5274 len. 32]: The slope eased off , at length we could be detached , and Croz and I , dashed away , ran a neck-and-neck race , which ended in a dead heat .
Parsing [sent. 5275 len. 17]: At 1:40 P.M. , the world was at our feet , and the Matterhorn was conquered !
Parsing [sent. 5276 len. 4]: The others arrived .
Parsing [sent. 5277 len. 14]: Croz now took the tent-pole , and planted it in the highest snow .
Parsing [sent. 5278 len. 20]: `` Yes , '' we said , `` there is the flag-staff , but where is the flag ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5279 len. 20]: `` Here it is , '' he answered , pulling off his blouse and fixing it to the stick .
Parsing [sent. 5280 len. 23]: It made a poor flag , and there was no wind to float it out , yet it was seen all around .
Parsing [sent. 5281 len. 16]: They saw it at Zermatt -- at the Riffel -- in the Val Tournanche ... .
Parsing [sent. 5282 len. 16]: We remained on the summit for one hour -- One crowded hour of glorious life .
Parsing [sent. 5283 len. 15]: It passed away too quickly , and we began to prepare for the descent .
Parsing [sent. 5284 len. 15]: Hudson and I consulted as to the best and safest arrangement of the party .
Parsing [sent. 5285 len. 54]: We agreed that it was best for Croz to go first , and Hadow second ; Hudson , who was almost equal to a guide in sureness of foot , wished to be third ; Lord Douglas was placed next , and old Peter , the strongest of the remainder , after him .
Parsing [sent. 5286 len. 33]: I suggested to Hudson that we should attach a rope to the rocks on our arrival at the difficult bit , and hold it as we descended , as an additional protection .
Parsing [sent. 5287 len. 17]: He approved the idea , but it was not definitely decided that it should be done .
Parsing [sent. 5288 len. 47]: The party was being arranged in the above order while I was sketching the summit , and they had finished , and were waiting for me to be tied in line , when some one remembered that our names had not been left in a bottle .
Parsing [sent. 5289 len. 17]: They requested me to write them down , and moved off while it was being done .
Parsing [sent. 5290 len. 32]: A few minutes afterward I tied myself to young Peter , ran down after the others , and caught them just as they were commencing the descent of the difficult part .
Parsing [sent. 5291 len. 6]: Great care was being taken .
Parsing [sent. 5292 len. 22]: Only one man was moving at a time ; when he was firmly planted the next advanced , and so on .
Parsing [sent. 5293 len. 20]: They had not , however , attached the additional rope to rocks , and nothing was said about it .
Parsing [sent. 5294 len. 23]: The suggestion was not made for my own sake , and I am not sure that it ever occurred to me again .
Parsing [sent. 5295 len. 59]: For some little distance we two followed the others , detached from them , and should have continued so had not Lord Douglas asked me , about 3 P.M. , to tie on to old Peter , as he feared , he said , that Taugwalder would not be able to hold his ground if a slip occurred .
Parsing [sent. 5296 len. 37]: A few minutes later , a sharp-eyed lad ran into the Monte Rosa Hotel , at Zermatt , saying that he had seen an avalanche fall from the summit of the Matterhorn onto the Matterhorn glacier .
Parsing [sent. 5297 len. 22]: The boy was reproved for telling idle stories ; he was right , nevertheless , and this was what he saw .
Parsing [sent. 5298 len. 40]: Michel Croz had laid aside his ax , and in order to give Mr. Hadow greater security , was absolutely taking hold of his legs , and putting his feet , one by one , into their proper positions .
Parsing [sent. 5299 len. 12]: As far as I know , no one was actually descending .
Parsing [sent. 5300 len. 79]: I can not speak with certainty , because the two leading men were partially hidden from my sight by an intervening mass of rock , but it is my belief , from the movements of their shoulders , that Croz , having done as I said , was in the act of turning round to go down a step or two himself ; at this moment Mr. Hadow slipped , fell against him , and knocked him over .
Parsing [sent. 5301 len. 34]: I heard one startled exclamation from Croz , then saw him and Mr. Hadow flying downward ; in another moment Hudson was dragged from his steps , and Lord Douglas immediately after him .
Parsing [sent. 5302 len. 9]: All this was the work of a moment .
Parsing [sent. 5303 len. 40]: Immediately we heard Croz 's exclamation , old Peter and I planted ourselves as firmly as the rocks would permit ; the rope was taut between us , and the jerk came on us both as on one man .
Parsing [sent. 5304 len. 15]: We held ; but the rope broke midway between Taugwalder and Lord Francis Douglas .
Parsing [sent. 5305 len. 26]: For a few seconds we saw our unfortunate companions sliding downward on their backs , and spreading out their hands , endeavoring to save themselves .
Parsing [sent. 5306 len. 35]: They passed from our sight uninjured , disappeared one by one , and fell from the precipice to precipice onto the Matterhorn glacier below , a distance of nearly four thousand feet in height .
Parsing [sent. 5307 len. 13]: From the moment the rope broke it was impossible to help them .
Parsing [sent. 5308 len. 5]: So perished our comrades !
Parsing [sent. 5309 len. 53]: For more than two hours afterward I thought almost every moment that the next would be my last ; for the Taugwalders , utterly unnerved , were not only incapable of giving assistance , but were in such a state that a slip might have been expected from them at any moment .
Parsing [sent. 5310 len. 31]: After a time we were able to do that which should have been done at first , and fixed rope to firm rocks , in addition to being tied together .
Parsing [sent. 5311 len. 14]: These ropes were cut from time to time , and were left behind .
Parsing [sent. 5312 len. 38]: Even with their assurance the men were afraid to proceed , and several times old Peter turned , with ashy face and faltering limbs , and said , with terrible emphasis , `` I CAN NOT ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5313 len. 22]: About 6 P.M. , we arrived at the snow upon the ridge descending toward Zermatt , and all peril was over .
Parsing [sent. 5314 len. 30]: We frequently looked , but in vain , for traces of our unfortunate companions ; we bent over the ridge and cried to them , but no sound returned .
Parsing [sent. 5315 len. 49]: Convinced at last that they were neither within sight nor hearing , we ceased from our useless efforts ; and , too cast down for speech , silently gathered up our things , and the little effects of those who were lost , and then completed the descent .
Parsing [sent. 5316 len. 10]: Such is Mr. Whymper 's graphic and thrilling narrative .
Parsing [sent. 5317 len. 50]: Zermatt gossip darkly hints that the elder Taugwalder cut the rope , when the accident occurred , in order to preserve himself from being dragged into the abyss ; but Mr. Whymper says that the ends of the rope showed no evidence of cutting , but only of breaking .
Parsing [sent. 5318 len. 32]: He adds that if Taugwalder had had the disposition to cut the rope , he would not have had time to do it , the accident was so sudden and unexpected .
Parsing [sent. 5319 len. 9]: Lord Douglas ' body has never been found .
Parsing [sent. 5320 len. 15]: It probably lodged upon some inaccessible shelf in the face of the mighty precipice .
Parsing [sent. 5321 len. 8]: Lord Douglas was a youth of nineteen .
Parsing [sent. 5322 len. 31]: The three other victims fell nearly four thousand feet , and their bodies lay together upon the glacier when found by Mr. Whymper and the other searchers the next morning .
Parsing [sent. 5323 len. 10]: Their graves are beside the little church in Zermatt .
Parsing [sent. 5324 len. 32]: CHAPTER XLII -LSB- Chillon has a Nice , Roomy Dungeon -RSB- Switzerland is simply a large , humpy , solid rock , with a thin skin of grass stretched over it .
Parsing [sent. 5325 len. 17]: Consequently , they do not dig graves , they blast them out with powder and fuse .
Parsing [sent. 5326 len. 19]: They can not afford to have large graveyards , the grass skin is too circumscribed and too valuable .
Parsing [sent. 5327 len. 11]: It is all required for the support of the living .
Parsing [sent. 5328 len. 12]: The graveyard in Zermatt occupies only about one-eighth of an acre .
Parsing [sent. 5329 len. 55]: The graves are sunk in the living rock , and are very permanent ; but occupation of them is only temporary ; the occupant can only stay till his grave is needed by a later subject , he is removed , then , for they do not bury one body on top of another .
Parsing [sent. 5330 len. 18]: As I understand it , a family owns a grave , just as it owns a house .
Parsing [sent. 5331 len. 28]: A man dies and leaves his house to his son -- and at the same time , this dead father succeeds to his own father 's grave .
Parsing [sent. 5332 len. 27]: He moves out of the house and into the grave , and his predecessor moves out of the grave and into the cellar of the chapel .
Parsing [sent. 5333 len. 32]: I saw a black box lying in the churchyard , with skull and cross-bones painted on it , and was told that this was used in transferring remains to the cellar .
Parsing [sent. 5334 len. 18]: In that cellar the bones and skulls of several hundred of former citizens were compactly corded up .
Parsing [sent. 5335 len. 17]: They made a pile eighteen feet long , seven feet high , and eight feet wide .
Parsing [sent. 5336 len. 54]: I was told that in some of the receptacles of this kind in the Swiss villages , the skulls were all marked , and if a man wished to find the skulls of his ancestors for several generations back , he could do it by these marks , preserved in the family records .
Parsing [sent. 5337 len. 21]: An English gentleman who had lived some years in this region , said it was the cradle of compulsory education .
Parsing [sent. 5338 len. 25]: But he said that the English idea that compulsory education would reduce bastardy and intemperance was an error -- it has not that effect .
Parsing [sent. 5339 len. 22]: He said there was more seduction in the Protestant than in the Catholic cantons , because the confessional protected the girls .
Parsing [sent. 5340 len. 14]: I wonder why it does n't protect married women in France and Spain ?
Parsing [sent. 5341 len. 55]: This gentleman said that among the poorer peasants in the Valais , it was common for the brothers in a family to cast lots to determine which of them should have the coveted privilege of marrying , and his brethren -- doomed bachelors -- heroically banded themselves together to help support the new family .
Parsing [sent. 5342 len. 23]: We left Zermatt in a wagon -- and in a rain-storm , too -- for St. Nicholas about ten o'clock one morning .
Parsing [sent. 5343 len. 28]: Again we passed between those grass-clad prodigious cliffs , specked with wee dwellings peeping over at us from velvety green walls ten and twelve hundred feet high .
Parsing [sent. 5344 len. 15]: It did not seem possible that the imaginary chamois even could climb those precipices .
Parsing [sent. 5345 len. 16]: Lovers on opposite cliffs probably kiss through a spy-glass , and correspond with a rifle .
Parsing [sent. 5346 len. 37]: In Switzerland the farmer 's plow is a wide shovel , which scrapes up and turns over the thin earthy skin of his native rock -- and there the man of the plow is a hero .
Parsing [sent. 5347 len. 20]: Now here , by our St. Nicholas road , was a grave , and it had a tragic story .
Parsing [sent. 5348 len. 92]: A plowman was skinning his farm one morning -- not the steepest part of it , but still a steep part -- that is , he was not skinning the front of his farm , but the roof of it , near the eaves -- when he absent-mindedly let go of the plow-handles to moisten his hands , in the usual way ; he lost his balance and fell out of his farm backward ; poor fellow , he never touched anything till he struck bottom , fifteen hundred feet below .
Parsing [sent. 5349 len. 7]: -LSB- This was on a Sunday .
Parsing [sent. 5350 len. 31]: -- M.T. -RSB- We throw a halo of heroism around the life of the soldier and the sailor , because of the deadly dangers they are facing all the time .
Parsing [sent. 5351 len. 14]: But we are not used to looking upon farming as a heroic occupation .
Parsing [sent. 5352 len. 10]: This is because we have not lived in Switzerland .
Parsing [sent. 5353 len. 15]: From St. Nicholas we struck out for Visp -- or Vispach -- on foot .
Parsing [sent. 5354 len. 22]: The rain-storms had been at work during several days , and had done a deal of damage in Switzerland and Savoy .
Parsing [sent. 5355 len. 27]: We came to one place where a stream had changed its course and plunged down a mountain in a new place , sweeping everything before it .
Parsing [sent. 5356 len. 11]: Two poor but precious farms by the roadside were ruined .
Parsing [sent. 5357 len. 32]: One was washed clear away , and the bed-rock exposed ; the other was buried out of sight under a tumbled chaos of rocks , gravel , mud , and rubbish .
Parsing [sent. 5358 len. 9]: The resistless might of water was well exemplified .
Parsing [sent. 5359 len. 26]: Some saplings which had stood in the way were bent to the ground , stripped clean of their bark , and buried under rocky debris .
Parsing [sent. 5360 len. 9]: The road had been swept away , too .
Parsing [sent. 5361 len. 76]: In another place , where the road was high up on the mountain 's face , and its outside edge protected by flimsy masonry , we frequently came across spots where this masonry had carved off and left dangerous gaps for mules to get over ; and with still more frequency we found the masonry slightly crumbled , and marked by mule-hoofs , thus showing that there had been danger of an accident to somebody .
Parsing [sent. 5362 len. 34]: When at last we came to a badly ruptured bit of masonry , with hoof-prints evidencing a desperate struggle to regain the lost foothold , I looked quite hopefully over the dizzy precipice .
Parsing [sent. 5363 len. 7]: But there was nobody down there .
Parsing [sent. 5364 len. 16]: They take exceedingly good care of their rivers in Switzerland and other portions of Europe .
Parsing [sent. 5365 len. 37]: They wall up both banks with slanting solid stone masonry -- so that from end to end of these rivers the banks look like the wharves at St. Louis and other towns on the Mississippi River .
Parsing [sent. 5366 len. 55]: It was during this walk from St. Nicholas , in the shadow of the majestic Alps , that we came across some little children amusing themselves in what seemed , at first , a most odd and original way -- but it was n't ; it was in simply a natural and characteristic way .
Parsing [sent. 5367 len. 33]: They were roped together with a string , they had mimic alpenstocks and ice-axes , and were climbing a meek and lowly manure-pile with a most blood-curdling amount of care and caution .
Parsing [sent. 5368 len. 33]: The `` guide '' at the head of the line cut imaginary steps , in a laborious and painstaking way , and not a monkey budged till the step above was vacated .
Parsing [sent. 5369 len. 56]: If we had waited we should have witnessed an imaginary accident , no doubt ; and we should have heard the intrepid band hurrah when they made the summit and looked around upon the `` magnificent view , '' and seen them throw themselves down in exhausted attitudes for a rest in that commanding situation .
Parsing [sent. 5370 len. 12]: In Nevada I used to see the children play at silver-mining .
Parsing [sent. 5371 len. 50]: Of course , the great thing was an accident in a mine , and there were two `` star '' parts ; that of the man who fell down the mimic shaft , and that of the daring hero who was lowered into the depths to bring him up .
Parsing [sent. 5372 len. 21]: I knew one small chap who always insisted on playing BOTH of these parts -- and he carried his point .
Parsing [sent. 5373 len. 23]: He would tumble into the shaft and die , and then come to the surface and go back after his own remains .
Parsing [sent. 5374 len. 61]: It is the smartest boy that gets the hero part everywhere ; he is head guide in Switzerland , head miner in Nevada , head bull-fighter in Spain , etc. ; but I knew a preacher 's son , seven years old , who once selected a part for himself compared to which those just mentioned are tame and unimpressive .
Parsing [sent. 5375 len. 41]: Jimmy 's father stopped him from driving imaginary horse-cars one Sunday -- stopped him from playing captain of an imaginary steamboat next Sunday -- stopped him from leading an imaginary army to battle the following Sunday -- and so on .
Parsing [sent. 5376 len. 21]: Finally the little fellow said : `` I 've tried everything , and they wo n't any of them do .
Parsing [sent. 5377 len. 6]: What CAN I play ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5378 len. 21]: `` I hardly know , Jimmy ; but you MUST play only things that are suitable to the Sabbath-day . ''
Parsing [sent. 5379 len. 19]: Next Sunday the preacher stepped softly to a back-room door to see if the children were rightly employed .
Parsing [sent. 5380 len. 4]: He peeped in .
Parsing [sent. 5381 len. 56]: A chair occupied the middle of the room , and on the back of it hung Jimmy 's cap ; one of his little sisters took the cap down , nibbled at it , then passed it to another small sister and said , `` Eat of this fruit , for it is good . ''
Parsing [sent. 5382 len. 17]: The Reverend took in the situation -- alas , they were playing the Expulsion from Eden !
Parsing [sent. 5383 len. 9]: Yet he found one little crumb of comfort .
Parsing [sent. 5384 len. 46]: He said to himself , `` For once Jimmy has yielded the chief role -- I have been wronging him , I did not believe there was so much modesty in him ; I should have expected him to be either Adam or Eve . ''
Parsing [sent. 5385 len. 36]: This crumb of comfort lasted but a very little while ; he glanced around and discovered Jimmy standing in an imposing attitude in a corner , with a dark and deadly frown on his face .
Parsing [sent. 5386 len. 13]: What that meant was very plain -- HE WAS IMPERSONATING THE DEITY !
Parsing [sent. 5387 len. 9]: Think of the guileless sublimity of that idea .
Parsing [sent. 5388 len. 16]: We reached Vispach at 8 P.M. , only about seven hours out from St. Nicholas .
Parsing [sent. 5389 len. 28]: So we must have made fully a mile and a half an hour , and it was all downhill , too , and very muddy at that .
Parsing [sent. 5390 len. 59]: We stayed all night at the Hotel de Soleil ; I remember it because the landlady , the portier , the waitress , and the chambermaid were not separate persons , but were all contained in one neat and chipper suit of spotless muslin , and she was the prettiest young creature I saw in all that region .
Parsing [sent. 5391 len. 7]: She was the landlord 's daughter .
Parsing [sent. 5392 len. 31]: And I remember that the only native match to her I saw in all Europe was the young daughter of the landlord of a village inn in the Black Forest .
Parsing [sent. 5393 len. 12]: Why do n't more people in Europe marry and keep hotel ?
Parsing [sent. 5394 len. 30]: Next morning we left with a family of English friends and went by train to Brevet , and thence by boat across the lake to Ouchy -LRB- Lausanne -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 5395 len. 45]: Ouchy is memorable to me , not on account of its beautiful situation and lovely surroundings -- although these would make it stick long in one 's memory -- but as the place where _ I _ caught the London TIMES dropping into humor .
Parsing [sent. 5396 len. 9]: It was NOT aware of it , though .
Parsing [sent. 5397 len. 8]: It did not do it on purpose .
Parsing [sent. 5398 len. 19]: An English friend called my attention to this lapse , and cut out the reprehensible paragraph for me .
Parsing [sent. 5399 len. 17]: Think of encountering a grin like this on the face of that grim journal : ERRATUM .
Parsing [sent. 5400 len. 51]: -- We are requested by Reuter 's Telegram Company to correct an erroneous announcement made in their Brisbane telegram of the 2d inst. , published in our impression of the 5th inst. , stating that `` Lady Kennedy had given birth to twins , the eldest being a son . ''
Parsing [sent. 5401 len. 21]: The Company explain that the message they received contained the words `` Governor of Queensland , TWINS FIRST SON . ''
Parsing [sent. 5402 len. 28]: Being , however , subsequently informed that Sir Arthur Kennedy was unmarried and that there must be some mistake , a telegraphic repetition was at once demanded .
Parsing [sent. 5403 len. 10]: It has been received today -LRB- 11th inst . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 5404 len. 30]: and shows that the words really telegraphed by Reuter 's agent were `` Governor Queensland TURNS FIRST SOD , '' alluding to the Maryborough-Gympic Railway in course of construction .
Parsing [sent. 5405 len. 29]: The words in italics were mutilated by the telegraph in transmission from Australia , and reaching the company in the form mentioned above gave rise to the mistake .
Parsing [sent. 5406 len. 63]: I had always had a deep and reverent compassion for the sufferings of the `` prisoner of Chillon , '' whose story Byron had told in such moving verse ; so I took the steamer and made pilgrimage to the dungeons of the Castle of Chillon , to see the place where poor Bonnivard endured his dreary captivity three hundred years ago .
Parsing [sent. 5407 len. 24]: I am glad I did that , for it took away some of the pain I was feeling on the prisoner 's account .
Parsing [sent. 5408 len. 25]: His dungeon was a nice , cool , roomy place , and I can not see why he should have been dissatisfied with it .
Parsing [sent. 5409 len. 71]: If he had been imprisoned in a St. Nicholas private dwelling , where the fertilizer prevails , and the goat sleeps with the guest , and the chickens roost on him and the cow comes in and bothers him when he wants to muse , it would have been another matter altogether ; but he surely could not have had a very cheerless time of it in that pretty dungeon .
Parsing [sent. 5410 len. 59]: It has romantic window-slits that let in generous bars of light , and it has tall , noble columns , carved apparently from the living rock ; and what is more , they are written all over with thousands of names ; some of them -- like Byron 's and Victor Hugo 's -- of the first celebrity .
Parsing [sent. 5411 len. 10]: Why did n't he amuse himself reading these names ?
Parsing [sent. 5412 len. 27]: Then there are the couriers and tourists -- swarms of them every day -- what was to hinder him from having a good time with them ?
Parsing [sent. 5413 len. 9]: I think Bonnivard 's sufferings have been overrated .
Parsing [sent. 5414 len. 18]: Next , we took the train and went to Martigny , on the way to Mont Blanc .
Parsing [sent. 5415 len. 12]: Next morning we started , about eight o'clock , on foot .
Parsing [sent. 5416 len. 19]: We had plenty of company , in the way of wagon-loads and mule-loads of tourists -- and dust .
Parsing [sent. 5417 len. 11]: This scattering procession of travelers was perhaps a mile long .
Parsing [sent. 5418 len. 12]: The road was uphill -- interminable uphill -- and tolerably steep .
Parsing [sent. 5419 len. 40]: The weather was blisteringly hot , and the man or woman who had to sit on a creeping mule , or in a crawling wagon , and broil in the beating sun , was an object to be pitied .
Parsing [sent. 5420 len. 20]: We could dodge among the bushes , and have the relief of shade , but those people could not .
Parsing [sent. 5421 len. 16]: They paid for a conveyance , and to get their money 's worth they rode .
Parsing [sent. 5422 len. 24]: We went by the way of the Tête Noir , and after we reached high ground there was no lack of fine scenery .
Parsing [sent. 5423 len. 44]: In one place the road was tunneled through a shoulder of the mountain ; from there one looked down into a gorge with a rushing torrent in it , and on every hand was a charming view of rocky buttresses and wooded heights .
Parsing [sent. 5424 len. 17]: There was a liberal allowance of pretty waterfalls , too , on the Tête Noir route .
Parsing [sent. 5425 len. 51]: About half an hour before we reached the village of Argentière a vast dome of snow with the sun blazing on it drifted into view and framed itself in a strong V-shaped gateway of the mountains , and we recognized Mont Blanc , the `` monarch of the Alps . ''
Parsing [sent. 5426 len. 28]: With every step , after that , this stately dome rose higher and higher into the blue sky , and at last seemed to occupy the zenith .
Parsing [sent. 5427 len. 19]: Some of Mont Blanc 's neighbors -- bare , light-brown , steeplelike rocks -- were very peculiarly shaped .
Parsing [sent. 5428 len. 49]: Some were whittled to a sharp point , and slightly bent at the upper end , like a lady 's finger ; one monster sugar-loaf resembled a bishop 's hat ; it was too steep to hold snow on its sides , but had some in the division .
Parsing [sent. 5429 len. 46]: While we were still on very high ground , and before the descent toward Argentière began , we looked up toward a neighboring mountain-top , and saw exquisite prismatic colors playing about some white clouds which were so delicate as to almost resemble gossamer webs .
Parsing [sent. 5430 len. 22]: The faint pinks and greens were peculiarly beautiful ; none of the colors were deep , they were the lightest shades .
Parsing [sent. 5431 len. 5]: They were bewitching commingled .
Parsing [sent. 5432 len. 11]: We sat down to study and enjoy this singular spectacle .
Parsing [sent. 5433 len. 61]: The tints remained during several minutes -- flitting , changing , melting into each other ; paling almost away for a moment , then reflushing -- a shifting , restless , unstable succession of soft opaline gleams , shimmering over that air film of white cloud , and turning it into a fabric dainty enough to clothe an angel with .
Parsing [sent. 5434 len. 44]: By and by we perceived what those super-delicate colors , and their continuous play and movement , reminded us of ; it is what one sees in a soap-bubble that is drifting along , catching changes of tint from the objects it passes .
Parsing [sent. 5435 len. 38]: A soap-bubble is the most beautiful thing , and the most exquisite , in nature ; that lovely phantom fabric in the sky was suggestive of a soap-bubble split open , and spread out in the sun .
Parsing [sent. 5436 len. 21]: I wonder how much it would take to buy a soap-bubble , if there was only one in the world ?
Parsing [sent. 5437 len. 15]: One could buy a hatful of Koh-i-Noors with the same money , no doubt .
Parsing [sent. 5438 len. 12]: We made the tramp from Martigny to Argentière in eight hours .
Parsing [sent. 5439 len. 15]: We beat all the mules and wagons ; we did n't usually do that .
Parsing [sent. 5440 len. 24]: We hired a sort of open baggage-wagon for the trip down the valley to Chamonix , and then devoted an hour to dining .
Parsing [sent. 5441 len. 9]: This gave the driver time to get drunk .
Parsing [sent. 5442 len. 18]: He had a friend with him , and this friend also had had time to get drunk .
Parsing [sent. 5443 len. 69]: When we drove off , the driver said all the tourists had arrived and gone by while we were at dinner ; `` but , '' said he , impressively , `` be not disturbed by that -- remain tranquil -- give yourselves no uneasiness -- their dust rises far before us -- rest you tranquil , leave all to me -- I am the king of drivers .
Parsing [sent. 5444 len. 3]: Behold ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5445 len. 10]: Down came his whip , and away we clattered .
Parsing [sent. 5446 len. 11]: I never had such a shaking up in my life .
Parsing [sent. 5447 len. 25]: The recent flooding rains had washed the road clear away in places , but we never stopped , we never slowed down for anything .
Parsing [sent. 5448 len. 30]: We tore right along , over rocks , rubbish , gullies , open fields -- sometimes with one or two wheels on the ground , but generally with none .
Parsing [sent. 5449 len. 28]: Every now and then that calm , good-natured madman would bend a majestic look over his shoulder at us and say , `` Ah , you perceive ?
Parsing [sent. 5450 len. 15]: It is as I have said -- I am the king of drivers . ''
Parsing [sent. 5451 len. 61]: Every time we just missed going to destruction , he would say , with tranquil happiness , `` Enjoy it , gentlemen , it is very rare , it is very unusual -- it is given to few to ride with the king of drivers -- and observe , it is as I have said , I am he . ''
Parsing [sent. 5452 len. 10]: He spoke in French , and punctuated with hiccoughs .
Parsing [sent. 5453 len. 21]: His friend was French , too , but spoke in German -- using the same system of punctuation , however .
Parsing [sent. 5454 len. 22]: The friend called himself the `` Captain of Mont Blanc , '' and wanted us to make the ascent with him .
Parsing [sent. 5455 len. 22]: He said he had made more ascents than any other man -- forty seven -- and his brother had made thirty-seven .
Parsing [sent. 5456 len. 39]: His brother was the best guide in the world , except himself -- but he , yes , observe him well -- he was the `` Captain of Mont Blanc '' -- that title belonged to none other .
Parsing [sent. 5457 len. 26]: The `` king '' was as good as his word -- he overtook that long procession of tourists and went by it like a hurricane .
Parsing [sent. 5458 len. 43]: The result was that we got choicer rooms at the hotel in Chamonix than we should have done if his majesty had been a slower artist -- or rather , if he had n't most providentially got drunk before he left Argentière .

Parsing [sent. 5507 len. 46]: That is to say , it was diligence-time -- the half-dozen big diligences would soon be arriving from Geneva , and the village was interested , in many ways , in knowing how many people were coming and what sort of folk they might be .
Parsing [sent. 5508 len. 16]: It was altogether the livest-looking street we had seen in any village on the continent .
Parsing [sent. 5509 len. 41]: The hotel was by the side of a booming torrent , whose music was loud and strong ; we could not see this torrent , for it was dark , now , but one could locate it without a light .
Parsing [sent. 5510 len. 37]: There was a large enclosed yard in front of the hotel , and this was filled with groups of villagers waiting to see the diligences arrive , or to hire themselves to excursionists for the morrow .
Parsing [sent. 5511 len. 19]: A telescope stood in the yard , with its huge barrel canted up toward the lustrous evening star .
Parsing [sent. 5512 len. 31]: The long porch of the hotel was populous with tourists , who sat in shawls and wraps under the vast overshadowing bulk of Mont Blanc , and gossiped or meditated .
Parsing [sent. 5513 len. 44]: Never did a mountain seem so close ; its big sides seemed at one 's very elbow , and its majestic dome , and the lofty cluster of slender minarets that were its neighbors , seemed to be almost over one 's head .
Parsing [sent. 5514 len. 69]: It was night in the streets , and the lamps were sparkling everywhere ; the broad bases and shoulders of the mountains were in a deep gloom , but their summits swam in a strange rich glow which was really daylight , and yet had a mellow something about it which was very different from the hard white glare of the kind of daylight I was used to .
Parsing [sent. 5515 len. 23]: Its radiance was strong and clear , but at the same time it was singularly soft , and spiritual , and benignant .
Parsing [sent. 5516 len. 25]: No , it was not our harsh , aggressive , realistic daylight ; it seemed properer to an enchanted land -- or to heaven .
Parsing [sent. 5517 len. 23]: I had seen moonlight and daylight together before , but I had not seen daylight and black night elbow to elbow before .
Parsing [sent. 5518 len. 30]: At least I had not seen the daylight resting upon an object sufficiently close at hand , before , to make the contrast startling and at war with nature .
Parsing [sent. 5519 len. 5]: The daylight passed away .
Parsing [sent. 5520 len. 59]: Presently the moon rose up behind some of those sky-piercing fingers or pinnacles of bare rock of which I have spoken -- they were a little to the left of the crest of Mont Blanc , and right over our heads -- but she could n't manage to climb high enough toward heaven to get entirely above them .
Parsing [sent. 5521 len. 82]: She would show the glittering arch of her upper third , occasionally , and scrape it along behind the comblike row ; sometimes a pinnacle stood straight up , like a statuette of ebony , against that glittering white shield , then seemed to glide out of it by its own volition and power , and become a dim specter , while the next pinnacle glided into its place and blotted the spotless disk with the black exclamation-point of its presence .
Parsing [sent. 5522 len. 29]: The top of one pinnacle took the shapely , clean-cut form of a rabbit 's head , in the inkiest silhouette , while it rested against the moon .
Parsing [sent. 5523 len. 30]: The unillumined peaks and minarets , hovering vague and phantom-like above us while the others were painfully white and strong with snow and moonlight , made a peculiar effect .
Parsing [sent. 5524 len. 34]: But when the moon , having passed the line of pinnacles , was hidden behind the stupendous white swell of Mont Blanc , the masterpiece of the evening was flung on the canvas .
Parsing [sent. 5525 len. 44]: A rich greenish radiance sprang into the sky from behind the mountain , and in this some airy shreds and ribbons of vapor floated about , and being flushed with that strange tint , went waving to and fro like pale green flames .
Parsing [sent. 5526 len. 25]: After a while , radiating bars -- vast broadening fan-shaped shadows -- grew up and stretched away to the zenith from behind the mountain .
Parsing [sent. 5527 len. 20]: It was a spectacle to take one 's breath , for the wonder of it , and the sublimity .
Parsing [sent. 5528 len. 43]: Indeed , those mighty bars of alternate light and shadow streaming up from behind that dark and prodigious form and occupying the half of the dull and opaque heavens , was the most imposing and impressive marvel I had ever looked upon .
Parsing [sent. 5529 len. 13]: There is no simile for it , for nothing is like it .
Parsing [sent. 5530 len. 37]: If a child had asked me what it was , I should have said , `` Humble yourself , in this presence , it is the glory flowing from the hidden head of the Creator . ''
Parsing [sent. 5531 len. 21]: One falls shorter of the truth than that , sometimes , in trying to explain mysteries to the little people .
Parsing [sent. 5532 len. 32]: I could have found out the cause of this awe-compelling miracle by inquiring , for it is not infrequent at Mont Blanc , -- but I did not wish to know .
Parsing [sent. 5533 len. 22]: We have not the reverent feeling for the rainbow that a savage has , because we know how it is made .
Parsing [sent. 5534 len. 14]: We have lost as much as we gained by prying into the matter .
Parsing [sent. 5535 len. 46]: We took a walk down street , a block or two , and a place where four streets met and the principal shops were clustered , found the groups of men in the roadway thicker than ever -- for this was the Exchange of Chamonix .
Parsing [sent. 5536 len. 18]: These men were in the costumes of guides and porters , and were there to be hired .
Parsing [sent. 5537 len. 20]: The office of that great personage , the Guide-in-Chief of the Chamonix Guild of Guides , was near by .
Parsing [sent. 5538 len. 14]: This guild is a close corporation , and is governed by strict laws .
Parsing [sent. 5539 len. 28]: There are many excursion routes , some dangerous and some not , some that can be made safely without a guide , and some that can not .
Parsing [sent. 5540 len. 6]: The bureau determines these things .
Parsing [sent. 5541 len. 17]: Where it decides that a guide is necessary , you are forbidden to go without one .
Parsing [sent. 5542 len. 20]: Neither are you allowed to be a victim of extortion : the law states what you are to pay .
Parsing [sent. 5543 len. 37]: The guides serve in rotation ; you can not select the man who is to take your life into his hands , you must take the worst in the lot , if it is his turn .
Parsing [sent. 5544 len. 38]: A guide 's fee ranges all the way up from a half-dollar -LRB- for some trifling excursion of a few rods -RRB- to twenty dollars , according to the distance traversed and the nature of the ground .
Parsing [sent. 5545 len. 26]: A guide 's fee for taking a person to the summit of Mont Blanc and back , is twenty dollars -- and he earns it .
Parsing [sent. 5546 len. 39]: The time employed is usually three days , and there is enough early rising in it to make a man far more `` healthy and wealthy and wise '' than any one man has any right to be .
Parsing [sent. 5547 len. 12]: The porter 's fee for the same trip is ten dollars .
Parsing [sent. 5548 len. 57]: Several fools -- no , I mean several tourists -- usually go together , and divide up the expense , and thus make it light ; for if only one f -- tourist , I mean -- went , he would have to have several guides and porters , and that would make the matter costly .
Parsing [sent. 5549 len. 8]: We went into the Chief 's office .
Parsing [sent. 5550 len. 27]: There were maps of mountains on the walls ; also one or two lithographs of celebrated guides , and a portrait of the scientist De Saussure .
Parsing [sent. 5551 len. 24]: In glass cases were some labeled fragments of boots and batons , and other suggestive relics and remembrances of casualties on Mount Blanc .
Parsing [sent. 5552 len. 47]: In a book was a record of all the ascents which have ever been made , beginning with Nos. 1 and 2 -- being those of Jacques Balmat and De Saussure , in 1787 , and ending with No. 685 , which was n't cold yet .
Parsing [sent. 5553 len. 44]: In fact No. 685 was standing by the official table waiting to receive the precious official diploma which should prove to his German household and to his descendants that he had once been indiscreet enough to climb to the top of Mont Blanc .
Parsing [sent. 5554 len. 22]: He looked very happy when he got his document ; in fact , he spoke up and said he WAS happy .
Parsing [sent. 5555 len. 41]: I tried to buy a diploma for an invalid friend at home who had never traveled , and whose desire all his life has been to ascend Mont Blanc , but the Guide-in-Chief rather insolently refused to sell me one .
Parsing [sent. 5556 len. 6]: I was very much offended .
Parsing [sent. 5557 len. 124]: I said I did not propose to be discriminated against on the account of my nationality ; that he had just sold a diploma to this German gentleman , and my money was a good as his ; I would see to it that he could n't keep his shop for Germans and deny his produce to Americans ; I would have his license taken away from him at the dropping of a handkerchief ; if France refused to break him , I would make an international matter of it and bring on a war ; the soil should be drenched with blood ; and not only that , but I would set up an opposition show and sell diplomas at half price .
Parsing [sent. 5558 len. 19]: For two cents I would have done these things , too ; but nobody offered me two cents .
Parsing [sent. 5559 len. 32]: I tried to move that German 's feelings , but it could not be done ; he would not give me his diploma , neither would he sell it to me .
Parsing [sent. 5560 len. 53]: I TOLD him my friend was sick and could not come himself , but he said he did not care a VERDAMMTES PFENNIG , he wanted his diploma for himself -- did I suppose he was going to risk his neck for that thing and then give it to a sick stranger ?
Parsing [sent. 5561 len. 10]: Indeed he would n't , so he would n't .
Parsing [sent. 5562 len. 17]: I resolved , then , that I would do all I could to injure Mont Blanc .
Parsing [sent. 5563 len. 17]: In the record-book was a list of all the fatal accidents which happened on the mountain .
Parsing [sent. 5564 len. 43]: It began with the one in 1820 when the Russian Dr. Hamel 's three guides were lost in a crevice of the glacier , and it recorded the delivery of the remains in the valley by the slow-moving glacier forty-one years later .
Parsing [sent. 5565 len. 8]: The latest catastrophe bore the date 1877 .
Parsing [sent. 5566 len. 10]: We stepped out and roved about the village awhile .
Parsing [sent. 5567 len. 32]: In front of the little church was a monument to the memory of the bold guide Jacques Balmat , the first man who ever stood upon the summit of Mont Blanc .
Parsing [sent. 5568 len. 9]: He made that wild trip solitary and alone .
Parsing [sent. 5569 len. 10]: He accomplished the ascent a number of times afterward .
Parsing [sent. 5570 len. 17]: A stretch of nearly half a century lay between his first ascent and his last one .
Parsing [sent. 5571 len. 33]: At the ripe old age of seventy-two he was climbing around a corner of a lofty precipice of the Pic du Midi -- nobody with him -- when he slipped and fell .
Parsing [sent. 5572 len. 7]: So he died in the harness .
Parsing [sent. 5573 len. 30]: He had grown very avaricious in his old age , and used to go off stealthily to hunt for non-existent and impossible gold among those perilous peaks and precipices .
Parsing [sent. 5574 len. 14]: He was on a quest of that kind when he lost his life .
Parsing [sent. 5575 len. 47]: There was a statue to him , and another to De Saussure , in the hall of our hotel , and a metal plate on the door of a room upstairs bore an inscription to the effect that that room had been occupied by Albert Smith .
Parsing [sent. 5576 len. 23]: Balmat and De Saussure discovered Mont Blanc -- so to speak -- but it was Smith who made it a paying property .
Parsing [sent. 5577 len. 29]: His articles in BLACKWOOD and his lectures on Mont Blanc in London advertised it and made people as anxious to see it as if it owed them money .
Parsing [sent. 5578 len. 22]: As we strolled along the road we looked up and saw a red signal-light glowing in the darkness of the mountainside .
Parsing [sent. 5579 len. 19]: It seemed but a trifling way up -- perhaps a hundred yards , a climb of ten minutes .
Parsing [sent. 5580 len. 47]: It was a lucky piece of sagacity in us that we concluded to stop a man whom we met and get a light for our pipes from him instead of continuing the climb to that lantern to get a light , as had been our purpose .
Parsing [sent. 5581 len. 20]: The man said that that lantern was on the Grands Mulets , some sixty-five hundred feet above the valley !
Parsing [sent. 5582 len. 24]: I know by our Riffelberg experience , that it would have taken us a good part of a week to go up there .
Parsing [sent. 5583 len. 17]: I would sooner not smoke at all , than take all that trouble for a light .
Parsing [sent. 5584 len. 17]: Even in the daytime the foreshadowing effect of this mountain 's close proximity creates curious deceptions .
Parsing [sent. 5585 len. 49]: For instance , one sees with the naked eye a cabin up there beside the glacier , and a little above and beyond he sees the spot where that red light was located ; he thinks he could throw a stone from the one place to the other .
Parsing [sent. 5586 len. 19]: But he could n't , for the difference between the two altitudes is more than three thousand feet .
Parsing [sent. 5587 len. 20]: It looks impossible , from below , that this can be true , but it is true , nevertheless .
Parsing [sent. 5588 len. 32]: While strolling around , we kept the run of the moon all the time , and we still kept an eye on her after we got back to the hotel portico .
Parsing [sent. 5589 len. 67]: I had a theory that the gravitation of refraction , being subsidiary to atmospheric compensation , the refrangibility of the earth 's surface would emphasize this effect in regions where great mountain ranges occur , and possibly so even-handed impact the odic and idyllic forces together , the one upon the other , as to prevent the moon from rising higher than 12,200 feet above sea-level .
Parsing [sent. 5590 len. 23]: This daring theory had been received with frantic scorn by some of my fellow-scientists , and with an eager silence by others .
Parsing [sent. 5591 len. 20]: Among the former I may mention Prof. H -- y ; and among the latter Prof. T -- l .
Parsing [sent. 5592 len. 22]: Such is professional jealousy ; a scientist will never show any kindness for a theory which he did not start himself .
Parsing [sent. 5593 len. 10]: There is no feeling of brotherhood among these people .
Parsing [sent. 5594 len. 12]: Indeed , they always resent it when I call them brother .
Parsing [sent. 5595 len. 50]: To show how far their ungenerosity can carry them , I will state that I offered to let Prof. H -- y publish my great theory as his own discovery ; I even begged him to do it ; I even proposed to print it myself as his theory .
Parsing [sent. 5596 len. 24]: Instead of thanking me , he said that if I tried to fasten that theory on him he would sue me for slander .
Parsing [sent. 5597 len. 41]: I was going to offer it to Mr. Darwin , whom I understood to be a man without prejudices , but it occurred to me that perhaps he would not be interested in it since it did not concern heraldry .
Parsing [sent. 5598 len. 35]: But I am glad now , that I was forced to father my intrepid theory myself , for , on the night of which I am writing , it was triumphantly justified and established .
Parsing [sent. 5599 len. 61]: Mont Blanc is nearly sixteen thousand feet high ; he hid the moon utterly ; near him is a peak which is 12,216 feet high ; the moon slid along behind the pinnacles , and when she approached that one I watched her with intense interest , for my reputation as a scientist must stand or fall by its decision .
Parsing [sent. 5600 len. 49]: I can not describe the emotions which surged like tidal waves through my breast when I saw the moon glide behind that lofty needle and pass it by without exposing more than two feet four inches of her upper rim above it ; I was secure , then .
Parsing [sent. 5601 len. 13]: I knew she could rise no higher , and I was right .
Parsing [sent. 5602 len. 20]: She sailed behind all the peaks and never succeeded in hoisting her disk above a single one of them .
Parsing [sent. 5603 len. 54]: While the moon was behind one of those sharp fingers , its shadow was flung athwart the vacant heavens -- a long , slanting , clean-cut , dark ray -- with a streaming and energetic suggestion of FORCE about it , such as the ascending jet of water from a powerful fire-engine affords .
Parsing [sent. 5604 len. 23]: It was curious to see a good strong shadow of an earthly object cast upon so intangible a field as the atmosphere .
Parsing [sent. 5605 len. 40]: We went to bed , at last , and went quickly to sleep , but I woke up , after about three hours , with throbbing temples , and a head which was physically sore , outside and in .
Parsing [sent. 5606 len. 12]: I was dazed , dreamy , wretched , seedy , unrefreshed .
Parsing [sent. 5607 len. 13]: I recognized the occasion of all this : it was that torrent .
Parsing [sent. 5608 len. 24]: In the mountain villages of Switzerland , and along the roads , one has always the roar of the torrent in his ears .
Parsing [sent. 5609 len. 28]: He imagines it is music , and he thinks poetic things about it ; he lies in his comfortable bed and is lulled to sleep by it .
Parsing [sent. 5610 len. 177]: But by and by he begins to notice that his head is very sore -- he can not account for it ; in solitudes where the profoundest silence reigns , he notices a sullen , distant , continuous roar in his ears , which is like what he would experience if he had sea-shells pressed against them -- he can not account for it ; he is drowsy and absent-minded ; there is no tenacity to his mind , he can not keep hold of a thought and follow it out ; if he sits down to write , his vocabulary is empty , no suitable words will come , he forgets what he started to do , and remains there , pen in hand , head tilted up , eyes closed , listening painfully to the muffled roar of a distant train in his ears ; in his soundest sleep the strain continues , he goes on listening , always listening intently , anxiously , and wakes at last , harassed , irritable , unrefreshed .
Parsing [sent. 5611 len. 10]: He can not manage to account for these things .
Parsing [sent. 5612 len. 16]: Day after day he feels as if he had spent his nights in a sleeping-car .
Parsing [sent. 5613 len. 22]: It actually takes him weeks to find out that it is those persecuting torrents that have been making all the mischief .
Parsing [sent. 5614 len. 30]: It is time for him to get out of Switzerland , then , for as soon as he has discovered the cause , the misery is magnified several fold .
Parsing [sent. 5615 len. 24]: The roar of the torrent is maddening , then , for his imagination is assisting ; the physical pain it inflicts is exquisite .
Parsing [sent. 5616 len. 30]: When he finds he is approaching one of those streams , his dread is so lively that he is disposed to fly the track and avoid the implacable foe .
Parsing [sent. 5617 len. 30]: Eight or nine months after the distress of the torrents had departed from me , the roar and thunder of the streets of Paris brought it all back again .
Parsing [sent. 5618 len. 14]: I moved to the sixth story of the hotel to hunt for peace .
Parsing [sent. 5619 len. 45]: About midnight the noises dulled away , and I was sinking to sleep , when I heard a new and curious sound ; I listened : evidently some joyous lunatic was softly dancing a `` double shuffle '' in the room over my head .
Parsing [sent. 5620 len. 13]: I had to wait for him to get through , of course .
Parsing [sent. 5621 len. 24]: Five long , long minutes he smoothly shuffled away -- a pause followed , then something fell with a thump on the floor .
Parsing [sent. 5622 len. 21]: I said to myself `` There -- he is pulling off his boots -- thank heavens he is done . ''
Parsing [sent. 5623 len. 10]: Another slight pause -- he went to shuffling again !
Parsing [sent. 5624 len. 22]: I said to myself , `` Is he trying to see what he can do with only one boot on ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5625 len. 11]: Presently came another pause and another thump on the floor .
Parsing [sent. 5626 len. 19]: I said `` Good , he has pulled off his other boot -- NOW he is done . ''
Parsing [sent. 5627 len. 5]: But he was n't .
Parsing [sent. 5628 len. 8]: The next moment he was shuffling again .
Parsing [sent. 5629 len. 16]: I said , `` Confound him , he is at it in his slippers ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5630 len. 21]: After a little came that same old pause , and right after it that thump on the floor once more .
Parsing [sent. 5631 len. 16]: I said , `` Hang him , he had on TWO pair of boots ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5632 len. 32]: For an hour that magician went on shuffling and pulling off boots till he had shed as many as twenty-five pair , and I was hovering on the verge of lunacy .
Parsing [sent. 5633 len. 9]: I got my gun and stole up there .
Parsing [sent. 5634 len. 32]: The fellow was in the midst of an acre of sprawling boots , and he had a boot in his hand , shuffling it -- no , I mean POLISHING it .
Parsing [sent. 5635 len. 5]: The mystery was explained .
Parsing [sent. 5636 len. 6]: He had n't been dancing .
Parsing [sent. 5637 len. 16]: He was the `` Boots '' of the hotel , and was attending to business .
Parsing [sent. 5638 len. 60]: CHAPTER XLIX -LSB- I Scale Mont Blanc -- by Telescope -RSB- After breakfast , that next morning in Chamonix , we went out in the yard and watched the gangs of excursioning tourists arriving and departing with their mules and guides and porters ; then we took a look through the telescope at the snowy hump of Mont Blanc .
Parsing [sent. 5639 len. 18]: It was brilliant with sunshine , and the vast smooth bulge seemed hardly five hundred yards away .
Parsing [sent. 5640 len. 52]: With the naked eye we could dimly make out the house at the Pierre Pointue , which is located by the side of the great glacier , and is more than three thousand feet above the level of the valley ; but with the telescope we could see all its details .
Parsing [sent. 5641 len. 29]: While I looked , a woman rode by the house on a mule , and I saw her with sharp distinctness ; I could have described her dress .
Parsing [sent. 5642 len. 30]: I saw her nod to the people of the house , and rein up her mule , and put her hand up to shield her eyes from the sun .
Parsing [sent. 5643 len. 34]: I was not used to telescopes ; in fact , I had never looked through a good one before ; it seemed incredible to me that this woman could be so far away .
Parsing [sent. 5644 len. 41]: I was satisfied that I could see all these details with my naked eye ; but when I tried it , that mule and those vivid people had wholly vanished , and the house itself was become small and vague .
Parsing [sent. 5645 len. 12]: I tried the telescope again , and again everything was vivid .
Parsing [sent. 5646 len. 30]: The strong black shadows of the mule and the woman were flung against the side of the house , and I saw the mule 's silhouette wave its ears .
Parsing [sent. 5647 len. 45]: The telescopulist -- or the telescopulariat -- I do not know which is right -- said a party were making a grand ascent , and would come in sight on the remote upper heights , presently ; so we waited to observe this performance .
Parsing [sent. 5648 len. 7]: Presently I had a superb idea .
Parsing [sent. 5649 len. 41]: I wanted to stand with a party on the summit of Mont Blanc , merely to be able to say I had done it , and I believed the telescope could set me within seven feet of the uppermost man .
Parsing [sent. 5650 len. 8]: The telescoper assured me that it could .
Parsing [sent. 5651 len. 17]: I then asked him how much I owed him for as far as I had got ?
Parsing [sent. 5652 len. 6]: He said , one franc .
Parsing [sent. 5653 len. 14]: I asked him how much it would cost to make the entire ascent ?
Parsing [sent. 5654 len. 3]: Three francs .
Parsing [sent. 5655 len. 10]: I at once determined to make the entire ascent .
Parsing [sent. 5656 len. 10]: But first I inquired if there was any danger ?
Parsing [sent. 5657 len. 26]: He said no -- not by telescope ; said he had taken a great many parties to the summit , and never lost a man .
Parsing [sent. 5658 len. 25]: I asked what he would charge to let my agent go with me , together with such guides and porters as might be necessary .
Parsing [sent. 5659 len. 50]: He said he would let Harris go for two francs ; and that unless we were unusually timid , he should consider guides and porters unnecessary ; it was not customary to take them , when going by telescope , for they were rather an encumbrance than a help .
Parsing [sent. 5660 len. 52]: He said that the party now on the mountain were approaching the most difficult part , and if we hurried we should overtake them within ten minutes , and could then join them and have the benefit of their guides and porters without their knowledge , and without expense to us .
Parsing [sent. 5661 len. 8]: I then said we would start immediately .
Parsing [sent. 5662 len. 35]: I believe I said it calmly , though I was conscious of a shudder and of a paling cheek , in view of the nature of the exploit I was so unreflectingly engaged in .
Parsing [sent. 5663 len. 36]: But the old daredevil spirit was upon me , and I said that as I had committed myself I would not back down ; I would ascend Mont Blanc if it cost me my life .
Parsing [sent. 5664 len. 18]: I told the man to slant his machine in the proper direction and let us be off .
Parsing [sent. 5665 len. 40]: Harris was afraid and did not want to go , but I heartened him up and said I would hold his hand all the way ; so he gave his consent , though he trembled a little at first .
Parsing [sent. 5666 len. 35]: I took a last pathetic look upon the pleasant summer scene about me , then boldly put my eye to the glass and prepared to mount among the grim glaciers and the everlasting snows .
Parsing [sent. 5667 len. 36]: We took our way carefully and cautiously across the great Glacier des Bossons , over yawning and terrific crevices and among imposing crags and buttresses of ice which were fringed with icicles of gigantic proportions .
Parsing [sent. 5668 len. 37]: The desert of ice that stretched far and wide about us was wild and desolate beyond description , and the perils which beset us were so great that at times I was minded to turn back .
Parsing [sent. 5669 len. 10]: But I pulled my pluck together and pushed on .
Parsing [sent. 5670 len. 17]: We passed the glacier safely and began to mount the steeps beyond , with great alacrity .
Parsing [sent. 5671 len. 36]: When we were seven minutes out from the starting-point , we reached an altitude where the scene took a new aspect ; an apparently limitless continent of gleaming snow was tilted heavenward before our faces .
Parsing [sent. 5672 len. 38]: As my eye followed that awful acclivity far away up into the remote skies , it seemed to me that all I had ever seen before of sublimity and magnitude was small and insignificant compared to this .
Parsing [sent. 5673 len. 13]: We rested a moment , and then began to mount with speed .
Parsing [sent. 5674 len. 19]: Within three minutes we caught sight of the party ahead of us , and stopped to observe them .
Parsing [sent. 5675 len. 36]: They were toiling up a long , slanting ridge of snow -- twelve persons , roped together some fifteen feet apart , marching in single file , and strongly marked against the clear blue sky .
Parsing [sent. 5676 len. 5]: One was a woman .
Parsing [sent. 5677 len. 43]: We could see them lift their feet and put them down ; we saw them swing their alpenstocks forward in unison , like so many pendulums , and then bear their weight upon them ; we saw the lady wave her handkerchief .
Parsing [sent. 5678 len. 41]: They dragged themselves upward in a worn and weary way , for they had been climbing steadily from the Grand Mulets , on the Glacier des Bossons , since three in the morning , and it was eleven , now .
Parsing [sent. 5679 len. 18]: We saw them sink down in the snow and rest , and drink something from a bottle .
Parsing [sent. 5680 len. 27]: After a while they moved on , and as they approached the final short dash of the home-stretch we closed up on them and joined them .
Parsing [sent. 5681 len. 9]: Presently we all stood together on the summit !
Parsing [sent. 5682 len. 8]: What a view was spread out below !
Parsing [sent. 5683 len. 220]: Away off under the northwestern horizon rolled the silent billows of the Farnese Oberland , their snowy crests glinting softly in the subdued lights of distance ; in the north rose the giant form of the Wobblehorn , draped from peak to shoulder in sable thunder-clouds ; beyond him , to the right , stretched the grand processional summits of the Cisalpine Cordillera , drowned in a sensuous haze ; to the east loomed the colossal masses of the Yodelhorn , the Fuddelhorn , and the Dinnerhorn , their cloudless summits flashing white and cold in the sun ; beyond them shimmered the faint far line of the Ghauts of Jubbelpore and the Aiguilles des Alleghenies ; in the south towered the smoking peak of Popocatapetl and the unapproachable altitudes of the peerless Scrabblehorn ; in the west-south the stately range of the Himalayas lay dreaming in a purple gloom ; and thence all around the curving horizon the eye roved over a troubled sea of sun-kissed Alps , and noted , here and there , the noble proportions and the soaring domes of the Bottlehorn , and the Saddlehorn , and the Shovelhorn , and the Powderhorn , all bathed in the glory of noon and mottled with softly gliding blots , the shadows flung from drifting clouds .
Parsing [sent. 5684 len. 17]: Overcome by the scene , we all raised a triumphant , tremendous shout , in unison .
Parsing [sent. 5685 len. 27]: A startled man at my elbow said : `` Confound you , what do you yell like that for , right here in the street ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5686 len. 11]: That brought me down to Chamonix , like a flirt .
Parsing [sent. 5687 len. 49]: I gave that man some spiritual advice and disposed of him , and then paid the telescope man his full fee , and said that we were charmed with the trip and would remain down , and not reascend and require him to fetch us down by telescope .
Parsing [sent. 5688 len. 32]: This pleased him very much , for of course we could have stepped back to the summit and put him to the trouble of bringing us home if we wanted to .
Parsing [sent. 5689 len. 50]: I judged we could get diplomas , now , anyhow ; so we went after them , but the Chief Guide put us off , with one pretext or another , during all the time we stayed in Chamonix , and we ended by never getting them at all .
Parsing [sent. 5690 len. 10]: So much for his prejudice against people 's nationality .
Parsing [sent. 5691 len. 18]: However , we worried him enough to make him remember us and our ascent for some time .
Parsing [sent. 5692 len. 17]: He even said , once , that he wished there was a lunatic asylum in Chamonix .
Parsing [sent. 5693 len. 16]: This shows that he really had fears that we were going to drive him mad .
Parsing [sent. 5694 len. 15]: It was what we intended to do , but lack of time defeated it .
Parsing [sent. 5695 len. 20]: I can not venture to advise the reader one way or the other , as to ascending Mont Blanc .
Parsing [sent. 5696 len. 32]: I say only this : if he is at all timid , the enjoyments of the trip will hardly make up for the hardships and sufferings he will have to endure .
Parsing [sent. 5697 len. 69]: But , if he has good nerve , youth , health , and a bold , firm will , and could leave his family comfortably provided for in case the worst happened , he would find the ascent a wonderful experience , and the view from the top a vision to dream about , and tell about , and recall with exultation all the days of his life .
Parsing [sent. 5698 len. 21]: While I do not advise such a person to attempt the ascent , I do not advise him against it .
Parsing [sent. 5699 len. 34]: But if he elects to attempt it , let him be warily careful of two things : chose a calm , clear day ; and do not pay the telescope man in advance .
Parsing [sent. 5700 len. 20]: There are dark stories of his getting advance payers on the summit and then leaving them there to rot .
Parsing [sent. 5701 len. 11]: A frightful tragedy was once witnessed through the Chamonix telescopes .
Parsing [sent. 5702 len. 14]: Think of questions and answers like these , on an inquest : CORONER .
Parsing [sent. 5703 len. 7]: You saw deceased lose his life ?
Parsing [sent. 5704 len. 2]: WITNESS .
Parsing [sent. 5705 len. 3]: I did .
Parsing [sent. 5706 len. 9]: C. Where was he , at the time ?
Parsing [sent. 5707 len. 9]: W. Close to the summit of Mont Blanc .
Parsing [sent. 5708 len. 5]: C. Where were you ?
Parsing [sent. 5709 len. 2]: W .
Parsing [sent. 5710 len. 7]: In the main street of Chamonix .
Parsing [sent. 5711 len. 2]: C .
Parsing [sent. 5712 len. 7]: What was the distance between you ?
Parsing [sent. 5713 len. 2]: W .
Parsing [sent. 5714 len. 11]: A LITTLE OVER FIVE MILES , as the bird flies .
Parsing [sent. 5715 len. 18]: This accident occurred in 1866 , a year and a month after the disaster on the Matterhorn .
Parsing [sent. 5716 len. 27]: Three adventurous English gentlemen , -LSB- 1 -RSB- of great experience in mountain-climbing , made up their minds to ascend Mont Blanc without guides or porters .
Parsing [sent. 5717 len. 10]: All endeavors to dissuade them from their project failed .
Parsing [sent. 5718 len. 7]: Powerful telescopes are numerous in Chamonix .
Parsing [sent. 5719 len. 41]: These huge brass tubes , mounted on their scaffoldings and pointed skyward from every choice vantage-ground , have the formidable look of artillery , and give the town the general aspect of getting ready to repel a charge of angels .
Parsing [sent. 5720 len. 40]: The reader may easily believe that the telescopes had plenty of custom on that August morning in 1866 , for everybody knew of the dangerous undertaking which was on foot , and all had fears that misfortune would result .
Parsing [sent. 5721 len. 27]: All the morning the tubes remained directed toward the mountain heights , each with its anxious group around it ; but the white deserts were vacant .
Parsing [sent. 5722 len. 2]: 1 .
Parsing [sent. 5723 len. 10]: Sir George Young and his brothers James and Albert .
Parsing [sent. 5724 len. 23]: At last , toward eleven o'clock , the people who were looking through the telescopes cried out `` There they are ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5725 len. 29]: -- and sure enough , far up , on the loftiest terraces of the Grand Plateau , the three pygmies appeared , climbing with remarkable vigor and spirit .
Parsing [sent. 5726 len. 17]: They disappeared in the `` Corridor , '' and were lost to sight during an hour .
Parsing [sent. 5727 len. 18]: Then they reappeared , and were presently seen standing together upon the extreme summit of Mont Blanc .
Parsing [sent. 5728 len. 6]: So , all was well .
Parsing [sent. 5729 len. 29]: They remained a few minutes on that highest point of land in Europe , a target for all the telescopes , and were then seen to begin descent .
Parsing [sent. 5730 len. 5]: Suddenly all three vanished .
Parsing [sent. 5731 len. 13]: An instant after , they appeared again , TWO THOUSAND FEET BELOW !
Parsing [sent. 5732 len. 28]: Evidently , they had tripped and been shot down an almost perpendicular slope of ice to a point where it joined the border of the upper glacier .
Parsing [sent. 5733 len. 39]: Naturally , the distant witness supposed they were now looking upon three corpses ; so they could hardly believe their eyes when they presently saw two of the men rise to their feet and bend over the third .
Parsing [sent. 5734 len. 25]: During two hours and a half they watched the two busying themselves over the extended form of their brother , who seemed entirely inert .
Parsing [sent. 5735 len. 31]: Chamonix 's affairs stood still ; everybody was in the street , all interest was centered upon what was going on upon that lofty and isolated stage five miles away .
Parsing [sent. 5736 len. 28]: Finally the two -- one of them walking with great difficulty -- were seen to begin descent , abandoning the third , who was no doubt lifeless .
Parsing [sent. 5737 len. 22]: Their movements were followed , step by step , until they reached the `` Corridor '' and disappeared behind its ridge .
Parsing [sent. 5738 len. 29]: Before they had had time to traverse the `` Corridor '' and reappear , twilight was come , and the power of the telescope was at an end .
Parsing [sent. 5739 len. 45]: The survivors had a most perilous journey before them in the gathering darkness , for they must get down to the Grands Mulets before they would find a safe stopping-place -- a long and tedious descent , and perilous enough even in good daylight .
Parsing [sent. 5740 len. 24]: The oldest guides expressed the opinion that they could not succeed ; that all the chances were that they would lose their lives .
Parsing [sent. 5741 len. 7]: Yet those brave men did succeed .
Parsing [sent. 5742 len. 8]: They reached the Grands Mulets in safety .
Parsing [sent. 5743 len. 19]: Even the fearful shock which their nerves had sustained was not sufficient to overcome their coolness and courage .
Parsing [sent. 5744 len. 73]: It would appear from the official account that they were threading their way down through those dangers from the closing in of twilight until two o'clock in the morning , or later , because the rescuing party from Chamonix reached the Grand Mulets about three in the morning and moved thence toward the scene of the disaster under the leadership of Sir George Young , `` who had only just arrived . ''
Parsing [sent. 5745 len. 40]: After having been on his feet twenty-four hours , in the exhausting work of mountain-climbing , Sir George began the reascent at the head of the relief party of six guides , to recover the corpse of his brother .
Parsing [sent. 5746 len. 18]: This was considered a new imprudence , as the number was too few for the service required .
Parsing [sent. 5747 len. 20]: Another relief party presently arrived at the cabin on the Grands Mulets and quartered themselves there to await events .
Parsing [sent. 5748 len. 58]: Ten hours after Sir George 's departure toward the summit , this new relief were still scanning the snowy altitudes above them from their own high perch among the ice deserts ten thousand feet above the level of the sea , but the whole forenoon had passed without a glimpse of any living thing appearing up there .
Parsing [sent. 5749 len. 4]: This was alarming .
Parsing [sent. 5750 len. 25]: Half a dozen of their number set out , then early in the afternoon , to seek and succor Sir George and his guides .
Parsing [sent. 5751 len. 17]: The persons remaining at the cabin saw these disappear , and then ensued another distressing wait .
Parsing [sent. 5752 len. 7]: Four hours passed , without tidings .
Parsing [sent. 5753 len. 18]: Then at five o'clock another relief , consisting of three guides , set forward from the cabin .
Parsing [sent. 5754 len. 41]: They carried food and cordials for the refreshment of their predecessors ; they took lanterns with them , too ; night was coming on , and to make matters worse , a fine , cold rain had begun to fall .
Parsing [sent. 5755 len. 34]: At the same hour that these three began their dangerous ascent , the official Guide-in-Chief of the Mont Blanc region undertook the dangerous descent to Chamonix , all alone , to get reinforcements .
Parsing [sent. 5756 len. 23]: However , a couple of hours later , at 7 P.M. , the anxious solicitude came to an end , and happily .
Parsing [sent. 5757 len. 22]: A bugle note was heard , and a cluster of black specks was distinguishable against the snows of the upper heights .
Parsing [sent. 5758 len. 13]: The watchers counted these specks eagerly -- fourteen -- nobody was missing .
Parsing [sent. 5759 len. 17]: An hour and a half later they were all safe under the roof of the cabin .
Parsing [sent. 5760 len. 8]: They had brought the corpse with them .
Parsing [sent. 5761 len. 24]: Sir George Young tarried there but a few minutes , and then began the long and troublesome descent from the cabin to Chamonix .
Parsing [sent. 5762 len. 29]: He probably reached there about two or three o'clock in the morning , after having been afoot among the rocks and glaciers during two days and two nights .
Parsing [sent. 5763 len. 8]: His endurance was equal to his daring .
Parsing [sent. 5764 len. 47]: The cause of the unaccountable delay of Sir George and the relief parties among the heights where the disaster had happened was a thick fog -- or , partly that and partly the slow and difficult work of conveying the dead body down the perilous steeps .
Parsing [sent. 5765 len. 29]: The corpse , upon being viewed at the inquest , showed no bruises , and it was some time before the surgeons discovered that the neck was broken .
Parsing [sent. 5766 len. 21]: One of the surviving brothers had sustained some unimportant injuries , but the other had suffered no hurt at all .
Parsing [sent. 5767 len. 24]: How these men could fall two thousand feet , almost perpendicularly , and live afterward , is a most strange and unaccountable thing .
Parsing [sent. 5768 len. 12]: A great many women have made the ascent of Mont Blanc .
Parsing [sent. 5769 len. 28]: An English girl , Miss Stratton , conceived the daring idea , two or three years ago , of attempting the ascent in the middle of winter .
Parsing [sent. 5770 len. 8]: She tried it -- and she succeeded .
Parsing [sent. 5771 len. 36]: Moreover , she froze two of her fingers on the way up , she fell in love with her guide on the summit , and she married him when she got to the bottom again .
Parsing [sent. 5772 len. 39]: There is nothing in romance , in the way of a striking `` situation , '' which can beat this love scene in midheaven on an isolated ice-crest with the thermometer at zero and an Artic gale blowing .
Parsing [sent. 5773 len. 19]: The first woman who ascended Mont Blanc was a girl aged twenty-two -- Mlle. Maria Paradis -- 1809 .
Parsing [sent. 5774 len. 15]: Nobody was with her but her sweetheart , and he was not a guide .
Parsing [sent. 5775 len. 21]: The sex then took a rest for about thirty years , when a Mlle. d'Angeville made the ascent -- 1838 .
Parsing [sent. 5776 len. 21]: In Chamonix I picked up a rude old lithograph of that day which pictured her `` in the act . ''
Parsing [sent. 5777 len. 16]: However , I value it less as a work of art than as a fashion-plate .
Parsing [sent. 5778 len. 32]: Miss d'Angeville put on a pair of men 's pantaloons to climb it , which was wise ; but she cramped their utility by adding her petticoat , which was idiotic .
Parsing [sent. 5779 len. 25]: One of the mournfulest calamities which men 's disposition to climb dangerous mountains has resulted in , happened on Mont Blanc in September 1870 .
Parsing [sent. 5780 len. 13]: M. D'Arve tells the story briefly in his HISTOIRE DU MONT BLANC .
Parsing [sent. 5781 len. 11]: In the next chapter I will copy its chief features .
Parsing [sent. 5782 len. 32]: CHAPTER XLV A Catastrophe Which Cost Eleven Lives On the 5th of September , 1870 , a caravan of eleven persons departed from Chamonix to make the ascent of Mont Blanc .
Parsing [sent. 5783 len. 31]: Three of the party were tourists ; Messrs. Randall and Bean , Americans , and Mr. George Corkindale , a Scotch gentleman ; there were three guides and five porters .
Parsing [sent. 5784 len. 23]: The cabin on the Grands Mulets was reached that day ; the ascent was resumed early the next morning , September 6th .
Parsing [sent. 5785 len. 35]: The day was fine and clear , and the movements of the party were observed through the telescopes of Chamonix ; at two o'clock in the afternoon they were seen to reach the summit .
Parsing [sent. 5786 len. 27]: A few minutes later they were seen making the first steps of the descent ; then a cloud closed around them and hid them from view .
Parsing [sent. 5787 len. 21]: Eight hours passed , the cloud still remained , night came , no one had returned to the Grands Mulets .
Parsing [sent. 5788 len. 22]: Sylvain Couttet , keeper of the cabin there , suspected a misfortune , and sent down to the valley for help .
Parsing [sent. 5789 len. 29]: A detachment of guides went up , but by the time they had made the tedious trip and reached the cabin , a raging storm had set in .
Parsing [sent. 5790 len. 14]: They had to wait ; nothing could be attempted in such a tempest .
Parsing [sent. 5791 len. 33]: The wild storm lasted MORE THAN A WEEK , without ceasing ; but on the 17th , Couttet , with several guides , left the cabin and succeeded in making the ascent .
Parsing [sent. 5792 len. 51]: In the snowy wastes near the summit they came upon five bodies , lying upon their sides in a reposeful attitude which suggested that possibly they had fallen asleep there , while exhausted with fatigue and hunger and benumbed with cold , and never knew when death stole upon them .
Parsing [sent. 5793 len. 12]: Couttet moved a few steps further and discovered five more bodies .
Parsing [sent. 5794 len. 21]: The eleventh corpse -- that of a porter -- was not found , although diligent search was made for it .
Parsing [sent. 5795 len. 73]: In the pocket of Mr. Bean , one of the Americans , was found a note-book in which had been penciled some sentences which admit us , in flesh and spirit , as it were , to the presence of these men during their last hours of life , and to the grisly horrors which their fading vision looked upon and their failing consciousness took cognizance of : TUESDAY , SEPT. 6 .
Parsing [sent. 5796 len. 23]: I have made the ascent of Mont Blanc , with ten persons -- eight guides , and Mr. Corkindale and Mr. Randall .
Parsing [sent. 5797 len. 9]: We reached the summit at half past 2 .
Parsing [sent. 5798 len. 13]: Immediately after quitting it , we were enveloped in clouds of snow .
Parsing [sent. 5799 len. 26]: We passed the night in a grotto hollowed in the snow , which afforded us but poor shelter , and I was ill all night .
Parsing [sent. 5800 len. 5]: SEPT. 7 -- MORNING .
Parsing [sent. 5801 len. 5]: The cold is excessive .
Parsing [sent. 5802 len. 8]: The snow falls heavily and without interruption .
Parsing [sent. 5803 len. 6]: The guides take no rest .
Parsing [sent. 5804 len. 2]: EVENING .
Parsing [sent. 5805 len. 46]: My Dear Hessie , we have been two days on Mont Blanc , in the midst of a terrible hurricane of snow , we have lost our way , and are in a hole scooped in the snow , at an altitude of 15,000 feet .
Parsing [sent. 5806 len. 9]: I have no longer any hope of descending .
Parsing [sent. 5807 len. 62]: They had wandered around , and around , in the blinding snow-storm , hopelessly lost , in a space only a hundred yards square ; and when cold and fatigue vanquished them at last , they scooped their cave and lay down there to die by inches , UNAWARE THAT FIVE STEPS MORE WOULD HAVE BROUGHT THEM INTO THE TRUTH PATH .
Parsing [sent. 5808 len. 17]: They were so near to life and safety as that , and did not suspect it .
Parsing [sent. 5809 len. 14]: The thought of this gives the sharpest pang that the tragic story conveys .
Parsing [sent. 5810 len. 62]: The author of the HISTOIRE DU MONT BLANC introduced the closing sentences of Mr. Bean 's pathetic record thus : `` Here the characters are large and unsteady ; the hand which traces them is become chilled and torpid ; but the spirit survives , and the faith and resignation of the dying man are expressed with a sublime simplicity . ''
Parsing [sent. 5811 len. 11]: Perhaps this note-book will be found and sent to you .
Parsing [sent. 5812 len. 28]: We have nothing to eat , my feet are already frozen , and I am exhausted ; I have strength to write only a few words more .
Parsing [sent. 5813 len. 17]: I have left means for C 's education ; I know you will employ them wisely .
Parsing [sent. 5814 len. 14]: I die with faith in God , and with loving thoughts of you .
Parsing [sent. 5815 len. 4]: Farewell to all .
Parsing [sent. 5816 len. 8]: We shall meet again , in Heaven .
Parsing [sent. 5817 len. 7]: ... I think of you always .
Parsing [sent. 5818 len. 24]: It is the way of the Alps to deliver death to their victims with a merciful swiftness , but here the rule failed .
Parsing [sent. 5819 len. 26]: These men suffered the bitterest death that has been recorded in the history of those mountains , freighted as that history is with grisly tragedies .
Parsing [sent. 5820 len. 41]: CHAPTER XLVI -LSB- Meeting a Hog on a Precipice -RSB- Mr. Harris and I took some guides and porters and ascended to the Hotel des Pyramides , which is perched on the high moraine which borders the Glacier des Bossons .
Parsing [sent. 5821 len. 30]: The road led sharply uphill , all the way , through grass and flowers and woods , and was a pleasant walk , barring the fatigue of the climb .
Parsing [sent. 5822 len. 14]: From the hotel we could view the huge glacier at very close range .
Parsing [sent. 5823 len. 28]: After a rest we followed down a path which had been made in the steep inner frontage of the moraine , and stepped upon the glacier itself .
Parsing [sent. 5824 len. 20]: One of the shows of the place was a tunnel-like cavern , which had been hewn in the glacier .
Parsing [sent. 5825 len. 13]: The proprietor of this tunnel took candles and conducted us into it .
Parsing [sent. 5826 len. 13]: It was three or four feet wide and about six feet high .
Parsing [sent. 5827 len. 31]: Its walls of pure and solid ice emitted a soft and rich blue light that produced a lovely effect , and suggested enchanted caves , and that sort of thing .
Parsing [sent. 5828 len. 46]: When we had proceeded some yards and were entering darkness , we turned about and had a dainty sunlit picture of distant woods and heights framed in the strong arch of the tunnel and seen through the tender blue radiance of the tunnel 's atmosphere .
Parsing [sent. 5829 len. 41]: The cavern was nearly a hundred yards long , and when we reached its inner limit the proprietor stepped into a branch tunnel with his candles and left us buried in the bowels of the glacier , and in pitch-darkness .
Parsing [sent. 5830 len. 71]: We judged his purpose was murder and robbery ; so we got out our matches and prepared to sell our lives as dearly as possible by setting the glacier on fire if the worst came to the worst -- but we soon perceived that this man had changed his mind ; he began to sing , in a deep , melodious voice , and woke some curious and pleasing echoes .
Parsing [sent. 5831 len. 19]: By and by he came back and pretended that that was what he had gone behind there for .
Parsing [sent. 5832 len. 11]: We believed as much of that as we wanted to .
Parsing [sent. 5833 len. 39]: Thus our lives had been once more in imminent peril , but by the exercise of the swift sagacity and cool courage which had saved us so often , we had added another escape to the long list .
Parsing [sent. 5834 len. 34]: The tourist should visit that ice-cavern , by all means , for it is well worth the trouble ; but I would advise him to go only with a strong and well-armed force .
Parsing [sent. 5835 len. 21]: I do not consider artillery necessary , yet it would not be unadvisable to take it along , if convenient .
Parsing [sent. 5836 len. 23]: The journey , going and coming , is about three miles and a half , three of which are on level ground .
Parsing [sent. 5837 len. 27]: We made it in less than a day , but I would counsel the unpracticed -- if not pressed for time -- to allow themselves two .
Parsing [sent. 5838 len. 34]: Nothing is gained in the Alps by over-exertion ; nothing is gained by crowding two days ' work into one for the poor sake of being able to boast of the exploit afterward .
Parsing [sent. 5839 len. 30]: It will be found much better , in the long run , to do the thing in two days , and then subtract one of them from the narrative .
Parsing [sent. 5840 len. 11]: This saves fatigue , and does not injure the narrative .
Parsing [sent. 5841 len. 11]: All the more thoughtful among the Alpine tourists do this .
Parsing [sent. 5842 len. 23]: We now called upon the Guide-in-Chief , and asked for a squadron of guides and porters for the ascent of the Montanvert .
Parsing [sent. 5843 len. 24]: This idiot glared at us , and said : `` You do n't need guides and porters to go to the Montanvert . ''
Parsing [sent. 5844 len. 9]: `` What do we need , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5845 len. 5]: `` Such as YOU ?
Parsing [sent. 5846 len. 5]: -- an ambulance ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5847 len. 15]: I was so stung by this brutal remark that I took my custom elsewhere .
Parsing [sent. 5848 len. 21]: Betimes , next morning , we had reached an altitude of five thousand feet above the level of the sea .
Parsing [sent. 5849 len. 6]: Here we camped and breakfasted .
Parsing [sent. 5850 len. 20]: There was a cabin there -- the spot is called the Caillet -- and a spring of ice-cold water .
Parsing [sent. 5851 len. 30]: On the door of the cabin was a sign , in French , to the effect that `` One may here see a living chamois for fifty centimes . ''
Parsing [sent. 5852 len. 15]: We did not invest ; what we wanted was to see a dead one .
Parsing [sent. 5853 len. 38]: A little after noon we ended the ascent and arrived at the new hotel on the Montanvert , and had a view of six miles , right up the great glacier , the famous Mer de Glace .
Parsing [sent. 5854 len. 39]: At this point it is like a sea whose deep swales and long , rolling swells have been caught in mid-movement and frozen solid ; but further up it is broken up into wildly tossing billows of ice .
Parsing [sent. 5855 len. 18]: We descended a ticklish path in the steep side of the moraine , and invaded the glacier .
Parsing [sent. 5856 len. 25]: There were tourists of both sexes scattered far and wide over it , everywhere , and it had the festive look of a skating-rink .
Parsing [sent. 5857 len. 9]: The Empress Josephine came this far , once .
Parsing [sent. 5858 len. 40]: She ascended the Montanvert in 1810 -- but not alone ; a small army of men preceded her to clear the path -- and carpet it , perhaps -- and she followed , under the protection of SIXTY-EIGHT guides .
Parsing [sent. 5859 len. 12]: Her successor visited Chamonix later , but in far different style .
Parsing [sent. 5860 len. 22]: It was seven weeks after the first fall of the Empire , and poor Marie Louise , ex-Empress was a fugitive .
Parsing [sent. 5861 len. 53]: She came at night , and in a storm , with only two attendants , and stood before a peasant 's hut , tired , bedraggled , soaked with rain , `` the red print of her lost crown still girdling her brow , '' and implored admittance -- and was refused !
Parsing [sent. 5862 len. 26]: A few days before , the adulations and applauses of a nation were sounding in her ears , and now she was come to this !
Parsing [sent. 5863 len. 14]: We crossed the Mer de Glace in safety , but we had misgivings .
Parsing [sent. 5864 len. 21]: The crevices in the ice yawned deep and blue and mysterious , and it made one nervous to traverse them .
Parsing [sent. 5865 len. 34]: The huge round waves of ice were slippery and difficult to climb , and the chances of tripping and sliding down them and darting into a crevice were too many to be comfortable .
Parsing [sent. 5866 len. 33]: In the bottom of a deep swale between two of the biggest of the ice-waves , we found a fraud who pretended to be cutting steps to insure the safety of tourists .
Parsing [sent. 5867 len. 39]: He was `` soldiering '' when we came upon him , but he hopped up and chipped out a couple of steps about big enough for a cat , and charged us a franc or two for it .
Parsing [sent. 5868 len. 16]: Then he sat down again , to doze till the next party should come along .
Parsing [sent. 5869 len. 28]: He had collected blackmail from two or three hundred people already , that day , but had not chipped out ice enough to impair the glacier perceptibly .
Parsing [sent. 5870 len. 30]: I have heard of a good many soft sinecures , but it seems to me that keeping toll-bridge on a glacier is the softest one I have encountered yet .
Parsing [sent. 5871 len. 18]: That was a blazing hot day , and it brought a persistent and persecuting thirst with it .
Parsing [sent. 5872 len. 20]: What an unspeakable luxury it was to slake that thirst with the pure and limpid ice-water of the glacier !
Parsing [sent. 5873 len. 76]: Down the sides of every great rib of pure ice poured limpid rills in gutters carved by their own attrition ; better still , wherever a rock had lain , there was now a bowl-shaped hole , with smooth white sides and bottom of ice , and this bowl was brimming with water of such absolute clearness that the careless observer would not see it at all , but would think the bowl was empty .
Parsing [sent. 5874 len. 30]: These fountains had such an alluring look that I often stretched myself out when I was not thirsty and dipped my face in and drank till my teeth ached .
Parsing [sent. 5875 len. 30]: Everywhere among the Swiss mountains we had at hand the blessing -- not to be found in Europe EXCEPT in the mountains -- of water capable of quenching thirst .
Parsing [sent. 5876 len. 34]: Everywhere in the Swiss highlands brilliant little rills of exquisitely cold water went dancing along by the roadsides , and my comrade and I were always drinking and always delivering our deep gratitude .
Parsing [sent. 5877 len. 23]: But in Europe everywhere except in the mountains , the water is flat and insipid beyond the power of words to describe .
Parsing [sent. 5878 len. 23]: It is served lukewarm ; but no matter , ice could not help it ; it is incurably flat , incurably insipid .
Parsing [sent. 5879 len. 24]: It is only good to wash with ; I wonder it does n't occur to the average inhabitant to try it for that .
Parsing [sent. 5880 len. 14]: In Europe the people say contemptuously , `` Nobody drinks water here . ''
Parsing [sent. 5881 len. 10]: Indeed , they have a sound and sufficient reason .
Parsing [sent. 5882 len. 13]: In many places they even have what may be called prohibitory reasons .
Parsing [sent. 5883 len. 24]: In Paris and Munich , for instance , they say , `` Do n't drink the water , it is simply poison . ''
Parsing [sent. 5884 len. 32]: Either America is healthier than Europe , notwithstanding her `` deadly '' indulgence in ice-water , or she does not keep the run of her death-rate as sharply as Europe does .
Parsing [sent. 5885 len. 26]: I think we do keep up the death statistics accurately ; and if we do , our cities are healthier than the cities of Europe .
Parsing [sent. 5886 len. 15]: Every month the German government tabulates the death-rate of the world and publishes it .
Parsing [sent. 5887 len. 28]: I scrap-booked these reports during several months , and it was curious to see how regular and persistently each city repeated its same death-rate month after month .
Parsing [sent. 5888 len. 14]: The tables might as well have been stereotyped , they varied so little .
Parsing [sent. 5889 len. 20]: These tables were based upon weekly reports showing the average of deaths in each 1,000 population for a year .
Parsing [sent. 5890 len. 38]: Munich was always present with her 33 deaths in each 1,000 of her population -LRB- yearly average -RRB- , Chicago was as constant with her 15 or 17 , Dublin with her 48 -- and so on .
Parsing [sent. 5891 len. 52]: Only a few American cities appear in these tables , but they are scattered so widely over the country that they furnish a good general average of CITY health in the United States ; and I think it will be granted that our towns and villages are healthier than our cities .
Parsing [sent. 5892 len. 50]: Here is the average of the only American cities reported in the German tables : Chicago , deaths in 1,000 population annually , 16 ; Philadelphia , 18 ; St. Louis , 18 ; San Francisco , 19 ; New York -LRB- the Dublin of America -RRB- , 23 .
Parsing [sent. 5893 len. 137]: See how the figures jump up , as soon as one arrives at the transatlantic list : Paris , 27 ; Glasgow , 27 ; London , 28 ; Vienna , 28 ; Augsburg , 28 ; Braunschweig , 28 ; Königsberg , 29 ; Cologne , 29 ; Dresden , 29 ; Hamburg , 29 ; Berlin , 30 ; Bombay , 30 ; Warsaw , 31 ; Breslau , 31 ; Odessa , 32 ; Munich , 33 ; Strasburg , 33 , Pesth , 35 ; Cassel , 35 ; Lisbon , 36 ; Liverpool , 36 ; Prague , 37 ; Madras , 37 ; Bucharest , 39 ; St. Petersburg , 40 ; Trieste , 40 ; Alexandria -LRB- Egypt -RRB- , 43 ; Dublin , 48 ; Calcutta , 55 .
Parsing [sent. 5894 len. 28]: Edinburgh is as healthy as New York -- 23 ; but there is no CITY in the entire list which is healthier , except Frankfort-on-the-Main -- 20 .
Parsing [sent. 5895 len. 18]: But Frankfort is not as healthy as Chicago , San Francisco , St. Louis , or Philadelphia .
Parsing [sent. 5896 len. 34]: Perhaps a strict average of the world might develop the fact that where one in 1,000 of America 's population dies , two in 1,000 of the other populations of the earth succumb .
Parsing [sent. 5897 len. 32]: I do not like to make insinuations , but I do think the above statistics darkly suggest that these people over here drink this detestable water `` on the sly . ''
Parsing [sent. 5898 len. 37]: We climbed the moraine on the opposite side of the glacier , and then crept along its sharp ridge a hundred yards or so , in pretty constant danger of a tumble to the glacier below .
Parsing [sent. 5899 len. 39]: The fall would have been only one hundred feet , but it would have closed me out as effectually as one thousand , therefore I respected the distance accordingly , and was glad when the trip was done .
Parsing [sent. 5900 len. 10]: A moraine is an ugly thing to assault head-first .
Parsing [sent. 5901 len. 50]: At a distance it looks like an endless grave of fine sand , accurately shaped and nicely smoothed ; but close by , it is found to be made mainly of rough boulders of all sizes , from that of a man 's head to that of a cottage .
Parsing [sent. 5902 len. 20]: By and by we came to the Mauvais Pas , or the Villainous Road , to translate it feelingly .
Parsing [sent. 5903 len. 28]: It was a breakneck path around the face of a precipice forty or fifty feet high , and nothing to hang on to but some iron railings .
Parsing [sent. 5904 len. 17]: I got along , slowly , safely , and uncomfortably , and finally reached the middle .
Parsing [sent. 5905 len. 40]: My hopes began to rise a little , but they were quickly blighted ; for there I met a hog -- a long-nosed , bristly fellow , that held up his snout and worked his nostrils at me inquiringly .
Parsing [sent. 5906 len. 13]: A hog on a pleasure excursion in Switzerland -- think of it !
Parsing [sent. 5907 len. 15]: It is striking and unusual ; a body might write a poem about it .
Parsing [sent. 5908 len. 14]: He could not retreat , if he had been disposed to do it .
Parsing [sent. 5909 len. 32]: It would have been foolish to stand upon our dignity in a place where there was hardly room to stand upon our feet , so we did nothing of the sort .
Parsing [sent. 5910 len. 25]: There were twenty or thirty ladies and gentlemen behind us ; we all turned about and went back , and the hog followed behind .
Parsing [sent. 5911 len. 20]: The creature did not seem set up by what he had done ; he had probably done it before .
Parsing [sent. 5912 len. 16]: We reached the restaurant on the height called the Chapeau at four in the afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 5913 len. 16]: It was a memento-factory , and the stock was large , cheap , and varied .
Parsing [sent. 5914 len. 45]: I bought the usual paper-cutter to remember the place by , and had Mont Blanc , the Mauvais Pas , and the rest of the region branded on my alpenstock ; then we descended to the valley and walked home without being tied together .
Parsing [sent. 5915 len. 17]: This was not dangerous , for the valley was five miles wide , and quite level .
Parsing [sent. 5916 len. 8]: We reached the hotel before nine o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 5917 len. 19]: Next morning we left for Geneva on top of the diligence , under shelter of a gay awning .
Parsing [sent. 5918 len. 14]: If I remember rightly , there were more than twenty people up there .
Parsing [sent. 5919 len. 12]: It was so high that the ascent was made by ladder .
Parsing [sent. 5920 len. 11]: The huge vehicle was full everywhere , inside and out .
Parsing [sent. 5921 len. 12]: Five other diligences left at the same time , all full .
Parsing [sent. 5922 len. 53]: We had engaged our seats two days beforehand , to make sure , and paid the regulation price , five dollars each ; but the rest of the company were wiser ; they had trusted Baedeker , and waited ; consequently some of them got their seats for one or two dollars .
Parsing [sent. 5923 len. 17]: Baedeker knows all about hotels , railway and diligence companies , and speaks his mind freely .
Parsing [sent. 5924 len. 9]: He is a trustworthy friend of the traveler .
Parsing [sent. 5925 len. 50]: We never saw Mont Blanc at his best until we were many miles away ; then he lifted his majestic proportions high into the heavens , all white and cold and solemn , and made the rest of the world seem little and plebeian , and cheap and trivial .
Parsing [sent. 5926 len. 48]: As he passed out of sight at last , an old Englishman settled himself in his seat and said : `` Well , I am satisfied , I have seen the principal features of Swiss scenery -- Mont Blanc and the goiter -- now for home ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5927 len. 48]: CHAPTER XLVII -LSB- Queer European Manners -RSB- We spent a few pleasant restful days at Geneva , that delightful city where accurate time-pieces are made for all the rest of the world , but whose own clocks never give the correct time of day by any accident .
Parsing [sent. 5928 len. 72]: Geneva is filled with pretty shops , and the shops are filled with the most enticing gimcrackery , but if one enters one of these places he is at once pounced upon , and followed up , and so persecuted to buy this , that , and the other thing , that he is very grateful to get out again , and is not at all apt to repeat his experiment .
Parsing [sent. 5929 len. 49]: The shopkeepers of the smaller sort , in Geneva , are as troublesome and persistent as are the salesmen of that monster hive in Paris , the Grands Magasins du Louvre -- an establishment where ill-mannered pestering , pursuing , and insistence have been reduced to a science .
Parsing [sent. 5930 len. 18]: In Geneva , prices in the smaller shops are very elastic -- that is another bad feature .
Parsing [sent. 5931 len. 20]: I was looking in at a window at a very pretty string of beads , suitable for a child .
Parsing [sent. 5932 len. 19]: I was only admiring them ; I had no use for them ; I hardly ever wear beads .
Parsing [sent. 5933 len. 13]: The shopwoman came out and offered them to me for thirty-five francs .
Parsing [sent. 5934 len. 13]: I said it was cheap , but I did not need them .
Parsing [sent. 5935 len. 12]: `` Ah , but monsieur , they are so beautiful ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5936 len. 20]: I confessed it , but said they were not suitable for one of my age and simplicity of character .
Parsing [sent. 5937 len. 29]: She darted in and brought them out and tried to force them into my hands , saying : `` Ah , but only see how lovely they are !
Parsing [sent. 5938 len. 14]: Surely monsieur will take them ; monsieur shall have them for thirty francs .
Parsing [sent. 5939 len. 18]: There , I have said it -- it is a loss , but one must live . ''
Parsing [sent. 5940 len. 16]: I dropped my hands , and tried to move her to respect my unprotected situation .
Parsing [sent. 5941 len. 26]: But no , she dangled the beads in the sun before my face , exclaiming , `` Ah , monsieur CAN NOT resist them ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5942 len. 33]: She hung them on my coat button , folded her hand resignedly , and said : `` Gone , -- and for thirty francs , the lovely things -- it is incredible !
Parsing [sent. 5943 len. 13]: -- but the good God will sanctify the sacrifice to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 5944 len. 29]: I removed them gently , returned them , and walked away , shaking my head and smiling a smile of silly embarrassment while the passers-by halted to observe .
Parsing [sent. 5945 len. 26]: The woman leaned out of her door , shook the beads , and screamed after me : `` Monsieur shall have them for twenty-eight ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5946 len. 5]: I shook my head .
Parsing [sent. 5947 len. 3]: `` Twenty-seven !
Parsing [sent. 5948 len. 19]: It is a cruel loss , it is ruin -- but take them , only take them . ''
Parsing [sent. 5949 len. 9]: I still retreated , still wagging my head .
Parsing [sent. 5950 len. 11]: `` MON DIEU , they shall even go for twenty-six !
Parsing [sent. 5951 len. 7]: There , I have said it .
Parsing [sent. 5952 len. 3]: Come ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5953 len. 5]: I wagged another negative .
Parsing [sent. 5954 len. 19]: A nurse and a little English girl had been near me , and were following me , now .
Parsing [sent. 5955 len. 25]: The shopwoman ran to the nurse , thrust the beads into her hands , and said : `` Monsieur shall have them for twenty-five !
Parsing [sent. 5956 len. 22]: Take them to the hotel -- he shall send me the money tomorrow -- next day -- when he likes . ''
Parsing [sent. 5957 len. 31]: Then to the child : `` When thy father sends me the money , come thou also , my angel , and thou shall have something oh so pretty ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5958 len. 6]: I was thus providentially saved .
Parsing [sent. 5959 len. 15]: The nurse refused the beads squarely and firmly , and that ended the matter .
Parsing [sent. 5960 len. 10]: The `` sights '' of Geneva are not numerous .
Parsing [sent. 5961 len. 27]: I made one attempt to hunt up the houses once inhabited by those two disagreeable people , Rousseau and Calvin , but I had no success .
Parsing [sent. 5962 len. 7]: Then I concluded to go home .
Parsing [sent. 5963 len. 23]: I found it was easier to propose to do that than to do it ; for that town is a bewildering place .
Parsing [sent. 5964 len. 21]: I got lost in a tangle of narrow and crooked streets , and stayed lost for an hour or two .
Parsing [sent. 5965 len. 26]: Finally I found a street which looked somewhat familiar , and said to myself , `` Now I am at home , I judge . ''
Parsing [sent. 5966 len. 12]: But I was wrong ; this was `` HELL street . ''
Parsing [sent. 5967 len. 26]: Presently I found another place which had a familiar look , and said to myself , `` Now I am at home , sure . ''
Parsing [sent. 5968 len. 5]: It was another error .
Parsing [sent. 5969 len. 7]: This was `` PURGATORY street . ''
Parsing [sent. 5970 len. 39]: After a little I said , `` NOW I 've got the right place , anyway ... no , this is ` PARADISE street ' ; I 'm further from home than I was in the beginning . ''
Parsing [sent. 5971 len. 14]: Those were queer names -- Calvin was the author of them , likely .
Parsing [sent. 5972 len. 25]: `` Hell '' and `` Purgatory '' fitted those two streets like a glove , but the `` Paradise '' appeared to be sarcastic .
Parsing [sent. 5973 len. 18]: I came out on the lake-front , at last , and then I knew where I was .
Parsing [sent. 5974 len. 16]: I was walking along before the glittering jewelry shops when I saw a curious performance .
Parsing [sent. 5975 len. 58]: A lady passed by , and a trim dandy lounged across the walk in such an apparently carefully timed way as to bring himself exactly in front of her when she got to him ; he made no offer to step out of the way ; he did not apologize ; he did not even notice her .
Parsing [sent. 5976 len. 11]: She had to stop still and let him lounge by .
Parsing [sent. 5977 len. 12]: I wondered if he had done that piece of brutality purposely .
Parsing [sent. 5978 len. 27]: He strolled to a chair and seated himself at a small table ; two or three other males were sitting at similar tables sipping sweetened water .
Parsing [sent. 5979 len. 21]: I waited ; presently a youth came by , and this fellow got up and served him the same trick .
Parsing [sent. 5980 len. 17]: Still , it did not seem possible that any one could do such a thing deliberately .
Parsing [sent. 5981 len. 49]: To satisfy my curiosity I went around the block , and , sure enough , as I approached , at a good round speed , he got up and lounged lazily across my path , fouling my course exactly at the right moment to receive all my weight .
Parsing [sent. 5982 len. 14]: This proved that his previous performances had not been accidental , but intentional .
Parsing [sent. 5983 len. 42]: I saw that dandy 's curious game played afterward , in Paris , but not for amusement ; not with a motive of any sort , indeed , but simply from a selfish indifference to other people 's comfort and rights .
Parsing [sent. 5984 len. 43]: One does not see it as frequently in Paris as he might expect to , for there the law says , in effect , `` It is the business of the weak to get out of the way of the strong . ''
Parsing [sent. 5985 len. 20]: We fine a cabman if he runs over a citizen ; Paris fines the citizen for being run over .
Parsing [sent. 5986 len. 37]: At least so everybody says -- but I saw something which caused me to doubt ; I saw a horseman run over an old woman one day -- the police arrested him and took him away .
Parsing [sent. 5987 len. 10]: That looked as if they meant to punish him .
Parsing [sent. 5988 len. 29]: It will not do for me to find merit in American manners -- for are they not the standing butt for the jests of critical and polished Europe ?
Parsing [sent. 5989 len. 92]: Still , I must venture to claim one little matter of superiority in our manners ; a lady may traverse our streets all day , going and coming as she chooses , and she will never be molested by any man ; but if a lady , unattended , walks abroad in the streets of London , even at noonday , she will be pretty likely to be accosted and insulted -- and not by drunken sailors , but by men who carry the look and wear the dress of gentlemen .
Parsing [sent. 5990 len. 20]: It is maintained that these people are not gentlemen , but are a lower sort , disguised as gentlemen .
Parsing [sent. 5991 len. 30]: The case of Colonel Valentine Baker obstructs that argument , for a man can not become an officer in the British army except he hold the rank of gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 5992 len. 31]: This person , finding himself alone in a railway compartment with an unprotected girl -- but it is an atrocious story , and doubtless the reader remembers it well enough .
Parsing [sent. 5993 len. 26]: London must have been more or less accustomed to Bakers , and the ways of Bakers , else London would have been offended and excited .
Parsing [sent. 5994 len. 58]: Baker was `` imprisoned '' -- in a parlor ; and he could not have been more visited , or more overwhelmed with attentions , if he had committed six murders and then -- while the gallows was preparing -- `` got religion '' -- after the manner of the holy Charles Peace , of saintly memory .
Parsing [sent. 5995 len. 31]: Arkansaw -- it seems a little indelicate to be trumpeting forth our own superiorities , and comparisons are always odious , but still -- Arkansaw would certainly have hanged Baker .
Parsing [sent. 5996 len. 20]: I do not say she would have tried him first , but she would have hanged him , anyway .
Parsing [sent. 5997 len. 21]: Even the most degraded woman can walk our streets unmolested , her sex and her weakness being her sufficient protection .
Parsing [sent. 5998 len. 26]: She will encounter less polish than she would in the old world , but she will run across enough humanity to make up for it .
Parsing [sent. 5999 len. 41]: The music of a donkey awoke us early in the morning , and we rose up and made ready for a pretty formidable walk -- to Italy ; but the road was so level that we took the train . .
Parsing [sent. 6000 len. 23]: We lost a good deal of time by this , but it was no matter , we were not in a hurry .
Parsing [sent. 6001 len. 10]: We were four hours going to Chamb ` ery .
Parsing [sent. 6002 len. 20]: The Swiss trains go upward of three miles an hour , in places , but they are quite safe .
Parsing [sent. 6003 len. 14]: That aged French town of Chambèry was as quaint and crooked as Heilbronn .
Parsing [sent. 6004 len. 26]: A drowsy reposeful quiet reigned in the back streets which made strolling through them very pleasant , barring the almost unbearable heat of the sun .
Parsing [sent. 6005 len. 43]: In one of these streets , which was eight feet wide , gracefully curved , and built up with small antiquated houses , I saw three fat hogs lying asleep , and a boy -LRB- also asleep -RRB- taking care of them .
Parsing [sent. 6006 len. 33]: From queer old-fashioned windows along the curve projected boxes of bright flowers , and over the edge of one of these boxes hung the head and shoulders of a cat -- asleep .
Parsing [sent. 6007 len. 14]: The five sleeping creatures were the only living things visible in that street .
Parsing [sent. 6008 len. 10]: There was not a sound ; absolute stillness prevailed .
Parsing [sent. 6009 len. 16]: It was Sunday ; one is not used to such dreamy Sundays on the continent .
Parsing [sent. 6010 len. 12]: In our part of the town it was different that night .
Parsing [sent. 6011 len. 23]: A regiment of brown and battered soldiers had arrived home from Algiers , and I judged they got thirsty on the way .
Parsing [sent. 6012 len. 13]: They sang and drank till dawn , in the pleasant open air .
Parsing [sent. 6013 len. 19]: We left for Turin at ten the next morning by a railway which was profusely decorated with tunnels .
Parsing [sent. 6014 len. 15]: We forgot to take a lantern along , consequently we missed all the scenery .
Parsing [sent. 6015 len. 5]: Our compartment was full .
Parsing [sent. 6016 len. 48]: A ponderous tow-headed Swiss woman , who put on many fine-lady airs , but was evidently more used to washing linen than wearing it , sat in a corner seat and put her legs across into the opposite one , propping them intermediately with her up-ended valise .
Parsing [sent. 6017 len. 20]: In the seat thus pirated , sat two Americans , greatly incommoded by that woman 's majestic coffin-clad feet .
Parsing [sent. 6018 len. 11]: One of them begged , politely , to remove them .
Parsing [sent. 6019 len. 15]: She opened her wide eyes and gave him a stare , but answered nothing .
Parsing [sent. 6020 len. 13]: By and by he proferred his request again , with great respectfulness .
Parsing [sent. 6021 len. 45]: She said , in good English , and in a deeply offended tone , that she had paid her passage and was not going to be bullied out of her `` rights '' by ill-bred foreigners , even if she was alone and unprotected .
Parsing [sent. 6022 len. 10]: `` But I have rights , also , madam .
Parsing [sent. 6023 len. 17]: My ticket entitles me to a seat , but you are occupying half of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 6024 len. 10]: `` I will not talk with you , sir .
Parsing [sent. 6025 len. 9]: What right have you to speak to me ?
Parsing [sent. 6026 len. 6]: I do not know you .
Parsing [sent. 6027 len. 14]: One would know you came from a land where there are no gentlemen .
Parsing [sent. 6028 len. 13]: No GENTLEMAN would treat a lady as you have treated me . ''
Parsing [sent. 6029 len. 18]: `` I come from a region where a lady would hardly give me the same provocation . ''
Parsing [sent. 6030 len. 8]: `` You have insulted me , sir !
Parsing [sent. 6031 len. 26]: You have intimated that I am not a lady -- and I hope I am NOT one , after the pattern of your country . ''
Parsing [sent. 6032 len. 37]: `` I beg that you will give yourself no alarm on that head , madam ; but at the same time I must insist -- always respectfully -- that you let me have my seat . ''
Parsing [sent. 6033 len. 10]: Here the fragile laundress burst into tears and sobs .
Parsing [sent. 6034 len. 8]: `` I never was so insulted before !
Parsing [sent. 6035 len. 4]: Never , never !
Parsing [sent. 6036 len. 40]: It is shameful , it is brutal , it is base , to bully and abuse an unprotected lady who has lost the use of her limbs and can not put her feet to the floor without agony ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6037 len. 15]: `` Good heavens , madam , why did n't you say that at first !
Parsing [sent. 6038 len. 6]: I offer a thousand pardons .
Parsing [sent. 6039 len. 7]: And I offer them most sincerely .
Parsing [sent. 6040 len. 15]: I did not know -- I COULD not know -- anything was the matter .
Parsing [sent. 6041 len. 21]: You are most welcome to the seat , and would have been from the first if I had only known .
Parsing [sent. 6042 len. 14]: I am truly sorry it all happened , I do assure you . ''
Parsing [sent. 6043 len. 13]: But he could n't get a word of forgiveness out of her .
Parsing [sent. 6044 len. 47]: She simply sobbed and sniffed in a subdued but wholly unappeasable way for two long hours , meantime crowding the man more than ever with her undertaker-furniture and paying no sort of attention to his frequent and humble little efforts to do something for her comfort .
Parsing [sent. 6045 len. 31]: Then the train halted at the Italian line and she hopped up and marched out of the car with as firm a leg as any washerwoman of all her tribe !
Parsing [sent. 6046 len. 14]: And how sick I was , to see how she had fooled me .
Parsing [sent. 6047 len. 7]: Turin is a very fine city .
Parsing [sent. 6048 len. 18]: In the matter of roominess it transcends anything that was ever dreamed of before , I fancy .
Parsing [sent. 6049 len. 38]: It sits in the midst of a vast dead-level , and one is obliged to imagine that land may be had for the asking , and no taxes to pay , so lavishly do they use it .
Parsing [sent. 6050 len. 37]: The streets are extravagantly wide , the paved squares are prodigious , the houses are huge and handsome , and compacted into uniform blocks that stretch away as straight as an arrow , into the distance .
Parsing [sent. 6051 len. 27]: The sidewalks are about as wide as ordinary European STREETS , and are covered over with a double arcade supported on great stone piers or columns .
Parsing [sent. 6052 len. 36]: One walks from one end to the other of these spacious streets , under shelter all the time , and all his course is lined with the prettiest of shops and the most inviting dining-houses .
Parsing [sent. 6053 len. 66]: There is a wide and lengthy court , glittering with the most wickedly enticing shops , which is roofed with glass , high aloft overhead , and paved with soft-toned marbles laid in graceful figures ; and at night when the place is brilliant with gas and populous with a sauntering and chatting and laughing multitude of pleasure-seekers , it is a spectacle worth seeing .
Parsing [sent. 6054 len. 27]: Everything is on a large scale ; the public buildings , for instance -- and they are architecturally imposing , too , as well as large .
Parsing [sent. 6055 len. 10]: The big squares have big bronze monuments in them .
Parsing [sent. 6056 len. 19]: At the hotel they gave us rooms that were alarming , for size , and parlor to match .
Parsing [sent. 6057 len. 26]: It was well the weather required no fire in the parlor , for I think one might as well have tried to warm a park .
Parsing [sent. 6058 len. 48]: The place would have a warm look , though , in any weather , for the window-curtains were of red silk damask , and the walls were covered with the same fire-hued goods -- so , also , were the four sofas and the brigade of chairs .
Parsing [sent. 6059 len. 20]: The furniture , the ornaments , the chandeliers , the carpets , were all new and bright and costly .
Parsing [sent. 6060 len. 27]: We did not need a parlor at all , but they said it belonged to the two bedrooms and we might use it if we chose .
Parsing [sent. 6061 len. 18]: Since it was to cost nothing , we were not averse to using it , of course .
Parsing [sent. 6062 len. 25]: Turin must surely read a good deal , for it has more book-stores to the square rod than any other town I know of .
Parsing [sent. 6063 len. 10]: And it has its own share of military folk .
Parsing [sent. 6064 len. 34]: The Italian officers ' uniforms are very much the most beautiful I have ever seen ; and , as a general thing , the men in them were as handsome as the clothes .
Parsing [sent. 6065 len. 24]: They were not large men , but they had fine forms , fine features , rich olive complexions , and lustrous black eyes .
Parsing [sent. 6066 len. 18]: For several weeks I had been culling all the information I could about Italy , from tourists .
Parsing [sent. 6067 len. 22]: The tourists were all agreed upon one thing -- one must expect to be cheated at every turn by the Italians .
Parsing [sent. 6068 len. 25]: I took an evening walk in Turin , and presently came across a little Punch and Judy show in one of the great squares .
Parsing [sent. 6069 len. 8]: Twelve or fifteen people constituted the audience .
Parsing [sent. 6070 len. 83]: This miniature theater was not much bigger than a man 's coffin stood on end ; the upper part was open and displayed a tinseled parlor -- a good-sized handkerchief would have answered for a drop-curtain ; the footlights consisted of a couple of candle-ends an inch long ; various manikins the size of dolls appeared on the stage and made long speeches at each other , gesticulating a good deal , and they generally had a fight before they got through .
Parsing [sent. 6071 len. 44]: They were worked by strings from above , and the illusion was not perfect , for one saw not only the strings but the brawny hand that manipulated them -- and the actors and actresses all talked in the same voice , too .
Parsing [sent. 6072 len. 17]: The audience stood in front of the theater , and seemed to enjoy the performance heartily .
Parsing [sent. 6073 len. 23]: When the play was done , a youth in his shirt-sleeves started around with a small copper saucer to make a collection .
Parsing [sent. 6074 len. 20]: I did not know how much to put in , but thought I would be guided by my predecessors .
Parsing [sent. 6075 len. 24]: Unluckily , I only had two of these , and they did not help me much because they did not put in anything .
Parsing [sent. 6076 len. 19]: I had no Italian money , so I put in a small Swiss coin worth about ten cents .
Parsing [sent. 6077 len. 42]: The youth finished his collection trip and emptied the result on the stage ; he had some very animated talk with the concealed manager , then he came working his way through the little crowd -- seeking me , I thought .
Parsing [sent. 6078 len. 29]: I had a mind to slip away , but concluded I would n't ; I would stand my ground , and confront the villainy , whatever it was .
Parsing [sent. 6079 len. 19]: The youth stood before me and held up that Swiss coin , sure enough , and said something .
Parsing [sent. 6080 len. 17]: I did not understand him , but I judged he was requiring Italian money of me .
Parsing [sent. 6081 len. 8]: The crowd gathered close , to listen .
Parsing [sent. 6082 len. 28]: I was irritated , and said -- in English , of course : `` I know it 's Swiss , but you 'll take that or none .
Parsing [sent. 6083 len. 7]: I have n't any other . ''
Parsing [sent. 6084 len. 14]: He tried to put the coin in my hand , and spoke again .
Parsing [sent. 6085 len. 14]: I drew my hand away , and said : `` NO , sir .
Parsing [sent. 6086 len. 7]: I know all about you people .
Parsing [sent. 6087 len. 12]: You ca n't play any of your fraudful tricks on me .
Parsing [sent. 6088 len. 23]: If there is a discount on that coin , I am sorry , but I am not going to make it good .
Parsing [sent. 6089 len. 15]: I noticed that some of the audience did n't pay you anything at all .
Parsing [sent. 6090 len. 34]: You let them go , without a word , but you come after me because you think I 'm a stranger and will put up with an extortion rather than have a scene .
Parsing [sent. 6091 len. 17]: But you are mistaken this time -- you 'll take that Swiss money or none . ''
Parsing [sent. 6092 len. 24]: The youth stood there with the coin in his fingers , nonplused and bewildered ; of course he had not understood a word .
Parsing [sent. 6093 len. 18]: An English-speaking Italian spoke up , now , and said : `` You are misunderstanding the boy .
Parsing [sent. 6094 len. 7]: He does not mean any harm .
Parsing [sent. 6095 len. 32]: He did not suppose you gave him so much money purposely , so he hurried back to return you the coin lest you might get away before you discovered your mistake .
Parsing [sent. 6096 len. 17]: Take it , and give him a penny -- that will make everything smooth again . ''
Parsing [sent. 6097 len. 11]: I probably blushed , then , for there was occasion .
Parsing [sent. 6098 len. 21]: Through the interpreter I begged the boy 's pardon , but I nobly refused to take back the ten cents .
Parsing [sent. 6099 len. 22]: I said I was accustomed to squandering large sums in that way -- it was the kind of person I was .
Parsing [sent. 6100 len. 22]: Then I retired to make a note to the effect that in Italy persons connected with the drama do not cheat .
Parsing [sent. 6101 len. 15]: The episode with the showman reminds me of a dark chapter in my history .
Parsing [sent. 6102 len. 16]: I once robbed an aged and blind beggar-woman of four dollars -- in a church .
Parsing [sent. 6103 len. 5]: It happened this way .
Parsing [sent. 6104 len. 31]: When I was out with the Innocents Abroad , the ship stopped in the Russian port of Odessa and I went ashore , with others , to view the town .
Parsing [sent. 6105 len. 31]: I got separated from the rest , and wandered about alone , until late in the afternoon , when I entered a Greek church to see what it was like .
Parsing [sent. 6106 len. 34]: When I was ready to leave , I observed two wrinkled old women standing stiffly upright against the inner wall , near the door , with their brown palms open to receive alms .
Parsing [sent. 6107 len. 11]: I contributed to the nearer one , and passed out .
Parsing [sent. 6108 len. 44]: I had gone fifty yards , perhaps , when it occurred to me that I must remain ashore all night , as I had heard that the ship 's business would carry her away at four o'clock and keep her away until morning .
Parsing [sent. 6109 len. 8]: It was a little after four now .
Parsing [sent. 6110 len. 45]: I had come ashore with only two pieces of money , both about the same size , but differing largely in value -- one was a French gold piece worth four dollars , the other a Turkish coin worth two cents and a half .
Parsing [sent. 6111 len. 28]: With a sudden and horrified misgiving , I put my hand in my pocket , now , and sure enough , I fetched out that Turkish penny !
Parsing [sent. 6112 len. 5]: Here was a situation .
Parsing [sent. 6113 len. 25]: A hotel would require pay in advance -- I must walk the street all night , and perhaps be arrested as a suspicious character .
Parsing [sent. 6114 len. 21]: There was but one way out of the difficulty -- I flew back to the church , and softly entered .
Parsing [sent. 6115 len. 21]: There stood the old woman yet , and in the palm of the nearest one still lay my gold piece .
Parsing [sent. 6116 len. 4]: I was grateful .
Parsing [sent. 6117 len. 35]: I crept close , feeling unspeakably mean ; I got my Turkish penny ready , and was extending a trembling hand to make the nefarious exchange , when I heard a cough behind me .
Parsing [sent. 6118 len. 23]: I jumped back as if I had been accused , and stood quaking while a worshiper entered and passed up the aisle .
Parsing [sent. 6119 len. 31]: I was there a year trying to steal that money ; that is , it seemed a year , though , of course , it must have been much less .
Parsing [sent. 6120 len. 25]: The worshipers went and came ; there were hardly ever three in the church at once , but there was always one or more .
Parsing [sent. 6121 len. 44]: Every time I tried to commit my crime somebody came in or somebody started out , and I was prevented ; but at last my opportunity came ; for one moment there was nobody in the church but the two beggar-women and me .
Parsing [sent. 6122 len. 22]: I whipped the gold piece out of the poor old pauper 's palm and dropped my Turkish penny in its place .
Parsing [sent. 6123 len. 16]: Poor old thing , she murmured her thanks -- they smote me to the heart .
Parsing [sent. 6124 len. 36]: Then I sped away in a guilty hurry , and even when I was a mile from the church I was still glancing back , every moment , to see if I was being pursued .
Parsing [sent. 6125 len. 43]: That experience has been of priceless value and benefit to me ; for I resolved then , that as long as I lived I would never again rob a blind beggar-woman in a church ; and I have always kept my word .
Parsing [sent. 6126 len. 20]: The most permanent lessons in morals are those which come , not of booky teaching , but of experience .
Parsing [sent. 6127 len. 35]: CHAPTER XLVIII -LSB- Beauty of Women -- and of Old Masters -RSB- In Milan we spent most of our time in the vast and beautiful Arcade or Gallery , or whatever it is called .
Parsing [sent. 6128 len. 79]: Blocks of tall new buildings of the most sumptuous sort , rich with decoration and graced with statues , the streets between these blocks roofed over with glass at a great height , the pavements all of smooth and variegated marble , arranged in tasteful patterns -- little tables all over these marble streets , people sitting at them , eating , drinking , or smoking -- crowds of other people strolling by -- such is the Arcade .
Parsing [sent. 6129 len. 11]: I should like to live in it all the time .
Parsing [sent. 6130 len. 19]: The windows of the sumptuous restaurants stand open , and one breakfasts there and enjoys the passing show .
Parsing [sent. 6131 len. 16]: We wandered all over the town , enjoying whatever was going on in the streets .
Parsing [sent. 6132 len. 35]: We took one omnibus ride , and as I did not speak Italian and could not ask the price , I held out some copper coins to the conductor , and he took two .
Parsing [sent. 6133 len. 20]: Then he went and got his tariff card and showed me that he had taken only the right sum .
Parsing [sent. 6134 len. 13]: So I made a note -- Italian omnibus conductors do not cheat .
Parsing [sent. 6135 len. 10]: Near the Cathedral I saw another instance of probity .
Parsing [sent. 6136 len. 10]: An old man was peddling dolls and toy fans .
Parsing [sent. 6137 len. 44]: Two small American children bought fans , and one gave the old man a franc and three copper coins , and both started away ; but they were called back , and the franc and one of the coppers were restored to them .
Parsing [sent. 6138 len. 24]: Hence it is plain that in Italy , parties connected with the drama and the omnibus and the toy interests do not cheat .
Parsing [sent. 6139 len. 13]: The stocks of goods in the shops were not extensive , generally .
Parsing [sent. 6140 len. 34]: In the vestibule of what seemed to be a clothing store , we saw eight or ten wooden dummies grouped together , clothed in woolen business suits and each marked with its price .
Parsing [sent. 6141 len. 10]: One suit was marked forty-five francs -- nine dollars .
Parsing [sent. 6142 len. 12]: Harris stepped in and said he wanted a suit like that .
Parsing [sent. 6143 len. 29]: Nothing easier : the old merchant dragged in the dummy , brushed him off with a broom , stripped him , and shipped the clothes to the hotel .
Parsing [sent. 6144 len. 28]: He said he did not keep two suits of the same kind in stock , but manufactured a second when it was needed to reclothe the dummy .
Parsing [sent. 6145 len. 13]: In another quarter we found six Italians engaged in a violent quarrel .
Parsing [sent. 6146 len. 42]: They danced fiercely about , gesticulating with their heads , their arms , their legs , their whole bodies ; they would rush forward occasionally with a sudden access of passion and shake their fists in each other 's very faces .
Parsing [sent. 6147 len. 29]: We lost half an hour there , waiting to help cord up the dead , but they finally embraced each other affectionately , and the trouble was over .
Parsing [sent. 6148 len. 31]: The episode was interesting , but we could not have afforded all the time to it if we had known nothing was going to come of it but a reconciliation .
Parsing [sent. 6149 len. 13]: Note made -- in Italy , people who quarrel cheat the spectator .
Parsing [sent. 6150 len. 6]: We had another disappointment afterward .
Parsing [sent. 6151 len. 36]: We approached a deeply interested crowd , and in the midst of it found a fellow wildly chattering and gesticulating over a box on the ground which was covered with a piece of old blanket .
Parsing [sent. 6152 len. 67]: Every little while he would bend down and take hold of the edge of the blanket with the extreme tips of his fingertips , as if to show there was no deception -- chattering away all the while -- but always , just as I was expecting to see a wonder feat of legerdemain , he would let go the blanket and rise to explain further .
Parsing [sent. 6153 len. 51]: However , at last he uncovered the box and got out a spoon with a liquid in it , and held it fair and frankly around , for people to see that it was all right and he was taking no advantage -- his chatter became more excited than ever .
Parsing [sent. 6154 len. 24]: I supposed he was going to set fire to the liquid and swallow it , so I was greatly wrought up and interested .
Parsing [sent. 6155 len. 78]: I got a cent ready in one hand and a florin in the other , intending to give him the former if he survived and the latter if he killed himself -- for his loss would be my gain in a literary way , and I was willing to pay a fair price for the item -- but this impostor ended his intensely moving performance by simply adding some powder to the liquid and polishing the spoon !
Parsing [sent. 6156 len. 23]: Then he held it aloft , and he could not have shown a wilder exultation if he had achieved an immortal miracle .
Parsing [sent. 6157 len. 30]: The crowd applauded in a gratified way , and it seemed to me that history speaks the truth when it says these children of the south are easily entertained .
Parsing [sent. 6158 len. 43]: We spent an impressive hour in the noble cathedral , where long shafts of tinted light were cleaving through the solemn dimness from the lofty windows and falling on a pillar here , a picture there , and a kneeling worshiper yonder .
Parsing [sent. 6159 len. 44]: The organ was muttering , censers were swinging , candles were glinting on the distant altar and robed priests were filing silently past them ; the scene was one to sweep all frivolous thoughts away and steep the soul in a holy calm .
Parsing [sent. 6160 len. 58]: A trim young American lady paused a yard or two from me , fixed her eyes on the mellow sparks flecking the far-off altar , bent her head reverently a moment , then straightened up , kicked her train into the air with her heel , caught it deftly in her hand , and marched briskly out .
Parsing [sent. 6161 len. 36]: We visited the picture-galleries and the other regulation `` sights '' of Milan -- not because I wanted to write about them again , but to see if I had learned anything in twelve years .
Parsing [sent. 6162 len. 15]: I afterward visited the great galleries of Rome and Florence for the same purpose .
Parsing [sent. 6163 len. 8]: I found I had learned one thing .
Parsing [sent. 6164 len. 19]: When I wrote about the Old Masters before , I said the copies were better than the originals .
Parsing [sent. 6165 len. 8]: That was a mistake of large dimensions .
Parsing [sent. 6166 len. 19]: The Old Masters were still unpleasing to me , but they were truly divine contrasted with the copies .
Parsing [sent. 6167 len. 36]: The copy is to the original as the pallid , smart , inane new wax-work group is to the vigorous , earnest , dignified group of living men and women whom it professes to duplicate .
Parsing [sent. 6168 len. 30]: There is a mellow richness , a subdued color , in the old pictures , which is to the eye what muffled and mellowed sound is to the ear .
Parsing [sent. 6169 len. 35]: That is the merit which is most loudly praised in the old picture , and is the one which the copy most conspicuously lacks , and which the copyist must not hope to compass .
Parsing [sent. 6170 len. 29]: It was generally conceded by the artists with whom I talked , that that subdued splendor , that mellow richness , is imparted to the picture by AGE .
Parsing [sent. 6171 len. 26]: Then why should we worship the Old Master for it , who did n't impart it , instead of worshiping Old Time , who did ?
Parsing [sent. 6172 len. 16]: Perhaps the picture was a clanging bell , until Time muffled it and sweetened it .
Parsing [sent. 6173 len. 23]: In conversation with an artist in Venice , I asked : `` What is it that people see in the Old Masters ?
Parsing [sent. 6174 len. 27]: I have been in the Doge 's palace and I saw several acres of very bad drawing , very bad perspective , and very incorrect proportions .
Parsing [sent. 6175 len. 43]: Paul Veronese 's dogs to not resemble dogs ; all the horses look like bladders on legs ; one man had a RIGHT leg on the left side of his body ; in the large picture where the Emperor -LRB- Barbarossa ? -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 6176 len. 64]: is prostrate before the Pope , there are three men in the foreground who are over thirty feet high , if one may judge by the size of a kneeling little boy in the center of the foreground ; and according to the same scale , the Pope is seven feet high and the Doge is a shriveled dwarf of four feet . ''
Parsing [sent. 6177 len. 118]: The artist said : `` Yes , the Old Masters often drew badly ; they did not care much for truth and exactness in minor details ; but after all , in spite of bad drawing , bad perspective , bad proportions , and a choice of subjects which no longer appeal to people as strongly as they did three hundred years ago , there is a SOMETHING about their pictures which is divine -- a something which is above and beyond the art of any epoch since -- a something which would be the despair of artists but that they never hope or expect to attain it , and therefore do not worry about it . ''
Parsing [sent. 6178 len. 21]: That is what he said -- and he said what he believed ; and not only believed , but felt .
Parsing [sent. 6179 len. 20]: Reasoning -- especially reasoning , without technical knowledge -- must be put aside , in cases of this kind .
Parsing [sent. 6180 len. 7]: It can not assist the inquirer .
Parsing [sent. 6181 len. 27]: It will lead him , in the most logical progression , to what , in the eyes of artists , would be a most illogical conclusion .
Parsing [sent. 6182 len. 63]: Thus : bad drawing , bad proportion , bad perspective , indifference to truthful detail , color which gets its merit from time , and not from the artist -- these things constitute the Old Master ; conclusion , the Old Master was a bad painter , the Old Master was not an Old Master at all , but an Old Apprentice .
Parsing [sent. 6183 len. 57]: Your friend the artist will grant your premises , but deny your conclusion ; he will maintain that notwithstanding this formidable list of confessed defects , there is still a something that is divine and unapproachable about the Old Master , and that there is no arguing the fact away by any system of reasoning whatsoever .
Parsing [sent. 6184 len. 5]: I can believe that .
Parsing [sent. 6185 len. 37]: There are women who have an indefinable charm in their faces which makes them beautiful to their intimates , but a cold stranger who tried to reason the matter out and find this beauty would fail .
Parsing [sent. 6186 len. 56]: He would say of one of these women : This chin is too short , this nose is too long , this forehead is too high , this hair is too red , this complexion is too pallid , the perspective of the entire composition is incorrect ; conclusion , the woman is not beautiful .
Parsing [sent. 6187 len. 68]: But her nearest friend might say , and say truly , `` Your premises are right , your logic is faultless , but your conclusion is wrong , nevertheless ; she is an Old Master -- she is beautiful , but only to such as know her ; it is a beauty which can not be formulated , but it is there , just the same . ''
Parsing [sent. 6188 len. 38]: I found more pleasure in contemplating the Old Masters this time than I did when I was in Europe in former years , but still it was a calm pleasure ; there was nothing overheated about it .
Parsing [sent. 6189 len. 45]: When I was in Venice before , I think I found no picture which stirred me much , but this time there were two which enticed me to the Doge 's palace day after day , and kept me there hours at a time .
Parsing [sent. 6190 len. 14]: One of these was Tintoretto 's three-acre picture in the Great Council Chamber .
Parsing [sent. 6191 len. 32]: When I saw it twelve years ago I was not strongly attracted to it -- the guide told me it was an insurrection in heaven -- but this was an error .
Parsing [sent. 6192 len. 10]: The movement of this great work is very fine .
Parsing [sent. 6193 len. 13]: There are ten thousand figures , and they are all doing something .
Parsing [sent. 6194 len. 12]: There is a wonderful `` go '' to the whole composition .
Parsing [sent. 6195 len. 59]: Some of the figures are driving headlong downward , with clasped hands , others are swimming through the cloud-shoals -- some on their faces , some on their backs -- great processions of bishops , martyrs , and angels are pouring swiftly centerward from various outlying directions -- everywhere is enthusiastic joy , there is rushing movement everywhere .
Parsing [sent. 6196 len. 41]: There are fifteen or twenty figures scattered here and there , with books , but they can not keep their attention on their reading -- they offer the books to others , but no one wishes to read , now .
Parsing [sent. 6197 len. 54]: The Lion of St. Mark is there with his book ; St. Mark is there with his pen uplifted ; he and the Lion are looking each other earnestly in the face , disputing about the way to spell a word -- the Lion looks up in rapt admiration while St. Mark spells .
Parsing [sent. 6198 len. 8]: This is wonderfully interpreted by the artist .
Parsing [sent. 6199 len. 9]: It is the master-stroke of this imcomparable painting .
Parsing [sent. 6200 len. 17]: I visited the place daily , and never grew tired of looking at that grand picture .
Parsing [sent. 6201 len. 25]: As I have intimated , the movement is almost unimaginably vigorous ; the figures are singing , hosannahing , and many are blowing trumpets .
Parsing [sent. 6202 len. 41]: So vividly is noise suggested , that spectators who become absorbed in the picture almost always fall to shouting comments in each other 's ears , making ear-trumpets of their curved hands , fearing they may not otherwise be heard .
Parsing [sent. 6203 len. 42]: One often sees a tourist , with the eloquent tears pouring down his cheeks , funnel his hands at his wife 's ear , and hears him roar through them , `` OH , TO BE THERE AND AT REST ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6204 len. 17]: None but the supremely great in art can produce effects like these with the silent brush .
Parsing [sent. 6205 len. 11]: Twelve years ago I could not have appreciated this picture .
Parsing [sent. 6206 len. 10]: One year ago I could not have appreciated it .
Parsing [sent. 6207 len. 14]: My study of Art in Heidelberg has been a noble education to me .
Parsing [sent. 6208 len. 13]: All that I am today in Art , I owe to that .
Parsing [sent. 6209 len. 14]: The other great work which fascinated me was Bassano 's immortal Hair Trunk .
Parsing [sent. 6210 len. 11]: This is in the Chamber of the Council of Ten .
Parsing [sent. 6211 len. 17]: It is in one of the three forty-foot pictures which decorate the walls of the room .
Parsing [sent. 6212 len. 9]: The composition of this picture is beyond praise .
Parsing [sent. 6213 len. 98]: The Hair Trunk is not hurled at the stranger 's head -- so to speak -- as the chief feature of an immortal work so often is ; no , it is carefully guarded from prominence , it is subordinated , it is restrained , it is most deftly and cleverly held in reserve , it is most cautiously and ingeniously led up to , by the master , and consequently when the spectator reaches it at last , he is taken unawares , he is unprepared , and it bursts upon him with a stupefying surprise .
Parsing [sent. 6214 len. 19]: One is lost in wonder at all the thought and care which this elaborate planning must have cost .
Parsing [sent. 6215 len. 37]: A general glance at the picture could never suggest that there was a hair trunk in it ; the Hair Trunk is not mentioned in the title even -- which is , `` Pope Alexander III .
Parsing [sent. 6216 len. 60]: and the Doge Ziani , the Conqueror of the Emperor Frederick Barbarossa '' ; you see , the title is actually utilized to help divert attention from the Trunk ; thus , as I say , nothing suggests the presence of the Trunk , by any hint , yet everything studiedly leads up to it , step by step .
Parsing [sent. 6217 len. 16]: Let us examine into this , and observe the exquisitely artful artlessness of the plan .
Parsing [sent. 6218 len. 36]: At the extreme left end of the picture are a couple of women , one of them with a child looking over her shoulder at a wounded man sitting with bandaged head on the ground .
Parsing [sent. 6219 len. 160]: These people seem needless , but no , they are there for a purpose ; one can not look at them without seeing the gorgeous procession of grandees , bishops , halberdiers , and banner-bearers which is passing along behind them ; one can not see the procession without feeling the curiosity to follow it and learn whither it is going ; it leads him to the Pope , in the center of the picture , who is talking with the bonnetless Doge -- talking tranquilly , too , although within twelve feet of them a man is beating a drum , and not far from the drummer two persons are blowing horns , and many horsemen are plunging and rioting about -- indeed , twenty-two feet of this great work is all a deep and happy holiday serenity and Sunday-school procession , and then we come suddenly upon eleven and one-half feet of turmoil and racket and insubordination .
Parsing [sent. 6220 len. 15]: This latter state of things is not an accident , it has its purpose .
Parsing [sent. 6221 len. 44]: But for it , one would linger upon the Pope and the Doge , thinking them to be the motive and supreme feature of the picture ; whereas one is drawn along , almost unconsciously , to see what the trouble is about .
Parsing [sent. 6222 len. 58]: Now at the very END of this riot , within four feet of the end of the picture , and full thirty-six feet from the beginning of it , the Hair Trunk bursts with an electrifying suddenness upon the spectator , in all its matchless perfection , and the great master 's triumph is sweeping and complete .
Parsing [sent. 6223 len. 37]: From that moment no other thing in those forty feet of canvas has any charm ; one sees the Hair Trunk , and the Hair Trunk only -- and to see it is to worship it .
Parsing [sent. 6224 len. 215]: Bassano even placed objects in the immediate vicinity of the Supreme Feature whose pretended purpose was to divert attention from it yet a little longer and thus delay and augment the surprise ; for instance , to the right of it he has placed a stooping man with a cap so red that it is sure to hold the eye for a moment -- to the left of it , some six feet away , he has placed a red-coated man on an inflated horse , and that coat plucks your eye to that locality the next moment -- then , between the Trunk and the red horseman he has intruded a man , naked to his waist , who is carrying a fancy flour-sack on the middle of his back instead of on his shoulder -- this admirable feat interests you , of course -- keeps you at bay a little longer , like a sock or a jacket thrown to the pursuing wolf -- but at last , in spite of all distractions and detentions , the eye of even the most dull and heedless spectator is sure to fall upon the World 's Masterpiece , and in that moment he totters to his chair or leans upon his guide for support .
Parsing [sent. 6225 len. 18]: Descriptions of such a work as this must necessarily be imperfect , yet they are of value .
Parsing [sent. 6226 len. 50]: The top of the Trunk is arched ; the arch is a perfect half-circle , in the Roman style of architecture , for in the then rapid decadence of Greek art , the rising influence of Rome was already beginning to be felt in the art of the Republic .
Parsing [sent. 6227 len. 18]: The Trunk is bound or bordered with leather all around where the lid joins the main body .
Parsing [sent. 6228 len. 35]: Many critics consider this leather too cold in tone ; but I consider this its highest merit , since it was evidently made so to emphasize by contrast the impassioned fervor of the hasp .
Parsing [sent. 6229 len. 29]: The highlights in this part of the work are cleverly managed , the MOTIF is admirably subordinated to the ground tints , and the technique is very fine .
Parsing [sent. 6230 len. 13]: The brass nail-heads are in the purest style of the early Renaissance .
Parsing [sent. 6231 len. 17]: The strokes , here , are very firm and bold -- every nail-head is a portrait .
Parsing [sent. 6232 len. 45]: The handle on the end of the Trunk has evidently been retouched -- I think , with a piece of chalk -- but one can still see the inspiration of the Old Master in the tranquil , almost too tranquil , hang of it .
Parsing [sent. 6233 len. 21]: The hair of this Trunk is REAL hair -- so to speak -- white in patches , brown in patches .
Parsing [sent. 6234 len. 22]: The details are finely worked out ; the repose proper to hair in a recumbent and inactive attitude is charmingly expressed .
Parsing [sent. 6235 len. 36]: There is a feeling about this part of the work which lifts it to the highest altitudes of art ; the sense of sordid realism vanishes away -- one recognizes that there is SOUL here .
Parsing [sent. 6236 len. 22]: View this Trunk as you will , it is a gem , it is a marvel , it is a miracle .
Parsing [sent. 6237 len. 93]: Some of the effects are very daring , approaching even to the boldest flights of the rococo , the sirocco , and the Byzantine schools -- yet the master 's hand never falters -- it moves on , calm , majestic , confident -- and , with that art which conceals art , it finally casts over the TOUT ENSEMBLE , by mysterious methods of its own , a subtle something which refines , subdues , etherealizes the arid components and endures them with the deep charm and gracious witchery of poesy .
Parsing [sent. 6238 len. 35]: Among the art-treasures of Europe there are pictures which approach the Hair Trunk -- there are two which may be said to equal it , possibly -- but there is none that surpasses it .
Parsing [sent. 6239 len. 19]: So perfect is the Hair Trunk that it moves even persons who ordinarily have no feeling for art .
Parsing [sent. 6240 len. 64]: When an Erie baggagemaster saw it two years ago , he could hardly keep from checking it ; and once when a customs inspector was brought into its presence , he gazed upon it in silent rapture for some moments , then slowly and unconsciously placed one hand behind him with the palm uppermost , and got out his chalk with the other .
Parsing [sent. 6241 len. 6]: These facts speak for themselves .
Parsing [sent. 6242 len. 21]: CHAPTER XLIX -LSB- Hanged with a Golden Rope -RSB- One lingers about the Cathedral a good deal , in Venice .
Parsing [sent. 6243 len. 23]: There is a strong fascination about it -- partly because it is so old , and partly because it is so ugly .
Parsing [sent. 6244 len. 43]: Too many of the world 's famous buildings fail of one chief virtue -- harmony ; they are made up of a methodless mixture of the ugly and the beautiful ; this is bad ; it is confusing , it is unrestful .
Parsing [sent. 6245 len. 14]: One has a sense of uneasiness , of distress , without knowing why .
Parsing [sent. 6246 len. 65]: But one is calm before St. Mark 's , one is calm within it , one would be calm on top of it , calm in the cellar ; for its details are masterfully ugly , no misplaced and impertinent beauties are intruded anywhere ; and the consequent result is a grand harmonious whole , of soothing , entrancing , tranquilizing , soul-satisfying ugliness .
Parsing [sent. 6247 len. 26]: One 's admiration of a perfect thing always grows , never declines ; and this is the surest evidence to him that it IS perfect .
Parsing [sent. 6248 len. 6]: St. Mark 's is perfect .
Parsing [sent. 6249 len. 30]: To me it soon grew to be so nobly , so augustly ugly , that it was difficult to stay away from it , even for a little while .
Parsing [sent. 6250 len. 52]: Every time its squat domes disappeared from my view , I had a despondent feeling ; whenever they reappeared , I felt an honest rapture -- I have not known any happier hours than those I daily spent in front of Florian 's , looking across the Great Square at it .
Parsing [sent. 6251 len. 28]: Propped on its long row of low thick-legged columns , its back knobbed with domes , it seemed like a vast warty bug taking a meditative walk .
Parsing [sent. 6252 len. 29]: St. Mark 's is not the oldest building in the world , of course , but it seems the oldest , and looks the oldest -- especially inside .
Parsing [sent. 6253 len. 24]: When the ancient mosaics in its walls become damaged , they are repaired but not altered ; the grotesque old pattern is preserved .
Parsing [sent. 6254 len. 18]: Antiquity has a charm of its own , and to smarten it up would only damage it .
Parsing [sent. 6255 len. 38]: One day I was sitting on a red marble bench in the vestibule looking up at an ancient piece of apprentice-work , in mosaic , illustrative of the command to `` multiply and replenish the earth . ''
Parsing [sent. 6256 len. 26]: The Cathedral itself had seemed very old ; but this picture was illustrating a period in history which made the building seem young by comparison .
Parsing [sent. 6257 len. 59]: But I presently found an antique which was older than either the battered Cathedral or the date assigned to the piece of history ; it was a spiral-shaped fossil as large as the crown of a hat ; it was embedded in the marble bench , and had been sat upon by tourists until it was worn smooth .
Parsing [sent. 6258 len. 24]: Contrasted with the inconceivable antiquity of this modest fossil , those other things were flippantly modern -- jejune -- mere matters of day-before-yesterday .
Parsing [sent. 6259 len. 19]: The sense of the oldness of the Cathedral vanished away under the influence of this truly venerable presence .
Parsing [sent. 6260 len. 22]: St. Mark 's is monumental ; it is an imperishable remembrancer of the profound and simple piety of the Middle Ages .
Parsing [sent. 6261 len. 21]: Whoever could ravish a column from a pagan temple , did it and contributed his swag to this Christian one .
Parsing [sent. 6262 len. 15]: So this fane is upheld by several hundred acquisitions procured in that peculiar way .
Parsing [sent. 6263 len. 29]: In our day it would be immoral to go on the highway to get bricks for a church , but it was no sin in the old times .
Parsing [sent. 6264 len. 13]: St. Mark 's was itself the victim of a curious robbery once .
Parsing [sent. 6265 len. 64]: The thing is set down in the history of Venice , but it might be smuggled into the Arabian Nights and not seem out of place there : Nearly four hundred and fifty years ago , a Candian named Stammato , in the suite of a prince of the house of Este , was allowed to view the riches of St. Mark 's .
Parsing [sent. 6266 len. 31]: His sinful eye was dazzled and he hid himself behind an altar , with an evil purpose in his heart , but a priest discovered him and turned him out .
Parsing [sent. 6267 len. 13]: Afterward he got in again -- by false keys , this time .
Parsing [sent. 6268 len. 65]: He went there , night after night , and worked hard and patiently , all alone , overcoming difficulty after difficulty with his toil , and at last succeeded in removing a great brick of the marble paneling which walled the lower part of the treasury ; this block he fixed so that he could take it out and put it in at will .
Parsing [sent. 6269 len. 49]: After that , for weeks , he spent all his midnights in his magnificent mine , inspecting it in security , gloating over its marvels at his leisure , and always slipping back to his obscure lodgings before dawn , with a duke 's ransom under his cloak .
Parsing [sent. 6270 len. 17]: He did not need to grab , haphazard , and run -- there was no hurry .
Parsing [sent. 6271 len. 15]: He could make deliberate and well-considered selections ; he could consult his esthetic tastes .
Parsing [sent. 6272 len. 63]: One comprehends how undisturbed he was , and how safe from any danger of interruption , when it is stated that he even carried off a unicorn 's horn -- a mere curiosity -- which would not pass through the egress entire , but had to be sawn in two -- a bit of work which cost him hours of tedious labor .
Parsing [sent. 6273 len. 29]: He continued to store up his treasures at home until his occupation lost the charm of novelty and became monotonous ; then he ceased from it , contented .
Parsing [sent. 6274 len. 20]: Well he might be ; for his collection , raised to modern values , represented nearly fifty million dollars !
Parsing [sent. 6275 len. 48]: He could have gone home much the richest citizen of his country , and it might have been years before the plunder was missed ; but he was human -- he could not enjoy his delight alone , he must have somebody to talk about it with .
Parsing [sent. 6276 len. 33]: So he exacted a solemn oath from a Candian noble named Crioni , then led him to his lodgings and nearly took his breath away with a sight of his glittering hoard .
Parsing [sent. 6277 len. 42]: He detected a look in his friend 's face which excited his suspicion , and was about to slip a stiletto into him when Crioni saved himself by explaining that that look was only an expression of supreme and happy astonishment .
Parsing [sent. 6278 len. 33]: Stammato made Crioni a present of one of the state 's principal jewels -- a huge carbuncle , which afterward figured in the Ducal cap of state -- and the pair parted .
Parsing [sent. 6279 len. 20]: Crioni went at once to the palace , denounced the criminal , and handed over the carbuncle as evidence .
Parsing [sent. 6280 len. 15]: Stammato was arrested , tried , and condemned , with the old-time Venetian promptness .
Parsing [sent. 6281 len. 28]: He was hanged between the two great columns in the Piazza -- with a gilded rope , out of compliment to his love of gold , perhaps .
Parsing [sent. 6282 len. 15]: He got no good of his booty at all -- it was ALL recovered .
Parsing [sent. 6283 len. 25]: In Venice we had a luxury which very seldom fell to our lot on the continent -- a home dinner with a private family .
Parsing [sent. 6284 len. 22]: If one could always stop with private families , when traveling , Europe would have a charm which it now lacks .
Parsing [sent. 6285 len. 21]: As it is , one must live in the hotels , of course , and that is a sorrowful business .
Parsing [sent. 6286 len. 32]: A man accustomed to American food and American domestic cookery would not starve to death suddenly in Europe ; but I think he would gradually waste away , and eventually die .
Parsing [sent. 6287 len. 11]: He would have to do without his accustomed morning meal .
Parsing [sent. 6288 len. 15]: That is too formidable a change altogether ; he would necessarily suffer from it .
Parsing [sent. 6289 len. 32]: He could get the shadow , the sham , the base counterfeit of that meal ; but it would do him no good , and money could not buy the reality .
Parsing [sent. 6290 len. 30]: To particularize : the average American 's simplest and commonest form of breakfast consists of coffee and beefsteak ; well , in Europe , coffee is an unknown beverage .
Parsing [sent. 6291 len. 22]: You can get what the European hotel-keeper thinks is coffee , but it resembles the real thing as hypocrisy resembles holiness .
Parsing [sent. 6292 len. 27]: It is a feeble , characterless , uninspiring sort of stuff , and almost as undrinkable as if it had been made in an American hotel .
Parsing [sent. 6293 len. 21]: The milk used for it is what the French call `` Christian '' milk -- milk which has been baptized .
Parsing [sent. 6294 len. 63]: After a few months ' acquaintance with European `` coffee , '' one 's mind weakens , and his faith with it , and he begins to wonder if the rich beverage of home , with its clotted layer of yellow cream on top of it , is not a mere dream , after all , and a thing which never existed .
Parsing [sent. 6295 len. 41]: Next comes the European bread -- fair enough , good enough , after a fashion , but cold ; cold and tough , and unsympathetic ; and never any change , never any variety -- always the same tiresome thing .
Parsing [sent. 6296 len. 23]: Next , the butter -- the sham and tasteless butter ; no salt in it , and made of goodness knows what .
Parsing [sent. 6297 len. 6]: Then there is the beefsteak .
Parsing [sent. 6298 len. 16]: They have it in Europe , but they do n't know how to cook it .
Parsing [sent. 6299 len. 7]: Neither will they cut it right .
Parsing [sent. 6300 len. 13]: It comes on the table in a small , round pewter platter .
Parsing [sent. 6301 len. 39]: It lies in the center of this platter , in a bordering bed of grease-soaked potatoes ; it is the size , shape , and thickness of a man 's hand with the thumb and fingers cut off .
Parsing [sent. 6302 len. 20]: It is a little overdone , is rather dry , it tastes pretty insipidly , it rouses no enthusiasm .
Parsing [sent. 6303 len. 173]: Imagine a poor exile contemplating that inert thing ; and imagine an angel suddenly sweeping down out of a better land and setting before him a mighty porterhouse steak an inch and a half thick , hot and sputtering from the griddle ; dusted with a fragrant pepper ; enriched with little melting bits of butter of the most unimpeachable freshness and genuineness ; the precious juices of the meat trickling out and joining the gravy , archipelagoed with mushrooms ; a township or two of tender , yellowish fat gracing an outlying district of this ample county of beefsteak ; the long white bone which divides the sirloin from the tenderloin still in its place ; and imagine that the angel also adds a great cup of American home-made coffee , with a cream a-froth on top , some real butter , firm and yellow and fresh , some smoking hot-biscuits , a plate of hot buckwheat cakes , with transparent syrup -- could words describe the gratitude of this exile ?
Parsing [sent. 6304 len. 23]: The European dinner is better than the European breakfast , but it has its faults and inferiorities ; it does not satisfy .
Parsing [sent. 6305 len. 74]: He comes to the table eager and hungry ; he swallows his soup -- there is an undefinable lack about it somewhere ; thinks the fish is going to be the thing he wants -- eats it and is n't sure ; thinks the next dish is perhaps the one that will hit the hungry place -- tries it , and is conscious that there was a something wanting about it , also .
Parsing [sent. 6306 len. 86]: And thus he goes on , from dish to dish , like a boy after a butterfly which just misses getting caught every time it alights , but somehow does n't get caught after all ; and at the end the exile and the boy have fared about alike ; the one is full , but grievously unsatisfied , the other has had plenty of exercise , plenty of interest , and a fine lot of hopes , but he has n't got any butterfly .
Parsing [sent. 6307 len. 42]: There is here and there an American who will say he can remember rising from a European table d'hôte perfectly satisfied ; but we must not overlook the fact that there is also here and there an American who will lie .
Parsing [sent. 6308 len. 19]: The number of dishes is sufficient ; but then it is such a monotonous variety of UNSTRIKING dishes .
Parsing [sent. 6309 len. 10]: It is an inane dead-level of `` fair-to-middling . ''
Parsing [sent. 6310 len. 7]: There is nothing to ACCENT it .
Parsing [sent. 6311 len. 77]: Perhaps if the roast of mutton or of beef -- a big , generous one -- were brought on the table and carved in full view of the client , that might give the right sense of earnestness and reality to the thing ; but they do n't do that , they pass the sliced meat around on a dish , and so you are perfectly calm , it does not stir you in the least .
Parsing [sent. 6312 len. 48]: Now a vast roast turkey , stretched on the broad of his back , with his heels in the air and the rich juices oozing from his fat sides ... but I may as well stop there , for they would not know how to cook him .
Parsing [sent. 6313 len. 22]: They ca n't even cook a chicken respectably ; and as for carving it , they do that with a hatchet .
Parsing [sent. 6314 len. 16]: This is about the customary table d'hôte bill in summer : Soup -LRB- characterless -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 6315 len. 13]: Fish -- sole , salmon , or whiting -- usually tolerably good .
Parsing [sent. 6316 len. 15]: Roast -- mutton or beef -- tasteless -- and some last year 's potatoes .
Parsing [sent. 6317 len. 16]: A pate , or some other made dish -- usually good -- `` considering . ''
Parsing [sent. 6318 len. 23]: One vegetable -- brought on in state , and all alone -- usually insipid lentils , or string-beans , or indifferent asparagus .
Parsing [sent. 6319 len. 8]: Roast chicken , as tasteless as paper .
Parsing [sent. 6320 len. 5]: Lettuce-salad -- tolerably good .
Parsing [sent. 6321 len. 5]: Decayed strawberries or cherries .
Parsing [sent. 6322 len. 23]: Sometimes the apricots and figs are fresh , but this is no advantage , as these fruits are of no account anyway .
Parsing [sent. 6323 len. 18]: The grapes are generally good , and sometimes there is a tolerably good peach , by mistake .
Parsing [sent. 6324 len. 9]: The variations of the above bill are trifling .
Parsing [sent. 6325 len. 41]: After a fortnight one discovers that the variations are only apparent , not real ; in the third week you get what you had the first , and in the fourth the week you get what you had the second .
Parsing [sent. 6326 len. 14]: Three or four months of this weary sameness will kill the robustest appetite .
Parsing [sent. 6327 len. 37]: It has now been many months , at the present writing , since I have had a nourishing meal , but I shall soon have one -- a modest , private affair , all to myself .
Parsing [sent. 6328 len. 39]: I have selected a few dishes , and made out a little bill of fare , which will go home in the steamer that precedes me , and be hot when I arrive -- as follows : Radishes .

Parsing [sent. 6407 len. 23]: Americans intending to spend a year or so in European hotels will do well to copy this bill and carry it along .
Parsing [sent. 6408 len. 24]: They will find it an excellent thing to get up an appetite with , in the dispiriting presence of the squalid table d'hôte .
Parsing [sent. 6409 len. 18]: Foreigners can not enjoy our food , I suppose , any more than we can enjoy theirs .
Parsing [sent. 6410 len. 13]: It is not strange ; for tastes are made , not born .
Parsing [sent. 6411 len. 32]: I might glorify my bill of fare until I was tired ; but after all , the Scotchman would shake his head and say , `` Where 's your haggis ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6412 len. 15]: and the Fijian would sigh and say , `` Where 's your missionary ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6413 len. 11]: I have a neat talent in matters pertaining to nourishment .
Parsing [sent. 6414 len. 7]: This has met with professional recognition .
Parsing [sent. 6415 len. 8]: I have often furnished recipes for cook-books .
Parsing [sent. 6416 len. 40]: Here are some designs for pies and things , which I recently prepared for a friend 's projected cook-book , but as I forgot to furnish diagrams and perspectives , they had to be left out , of course .
Parsing [sent. 6417 len. 28]: RECIPE FOR AN ASH-CAKE Take a lot of water and add to it a lot of coarse Indian-meal and about a quarter of a lot of salt .
Parsing [sent. 6418 len. 31]: Mix well together , knead into the form of a `` pone , '' and let the pone stand awhile -- not on its edge , but the other way .
Parsing [sent. 6419 len. 22]: Rake away a place among the embers , lay it there , and cover it an inch deep with hot ashes .
Parsing [sent. 6420 len. 23]: When it is done , remove it ; blow off all the ashes but one layer ; butter that one and eat .
Parsing [sent. 6421 len. 11]: N.B. -- No household should ever be without this talisman .
Parsing [sent. 6422 len. 12]: It has been noticed that tramps never return for another ash-cake .
Parsing [sent. 6423 len. 34]: ---------- RECIPE FOR NEW ENGLISH PIE To make this excellent breakfast dish , proceed as follows : Take a sufficiency of water and a sufficiency of flour , and construct a bullet-proof dough .
Parsing [sent. 6424 len. 20]: Work this into the form of a disk , with the edges turned up some three-fourths of an inch .
Parsing [sent. 6425 len. 14]: Toughen and kiln-dry in a couple days in a mild but unvarying temperature .
Parsing [sent. 6426 len. 16]: Construct a cover for this redoubt in the same way and of the same material .
Parsing [sent. 6427 len. 40]: Fill with stewed dried apples ; aggravate with cloves , lemon-peel , and slabs of citron ; add two portions of New Orleans sugars , then solder on the lid and set in a safe place till it petrifies .
Parsing [sent. 6428 len. 9]: Serve cold at breakfast and invite your enemy .
Parsing [sent. 6429 len. 34]: ---------- RECIPE FOR GERMAN COFFEE Take a barrel of water and bring it to a boil ; rub a chicory berry against a coffee berry , then convey the former into the water .
Parsing [sent. 6430 len. 32]: Continue the boiling and evaporation until the intensity of the flavor and aroma of the coffee and chicory has been diminished to a proper degree ; then set aside to cool .
Parsing [sent. 6431 len. 57]: Now unharness the remains of a once cow from the plow , insert them in a hydraulic press , and when you shall have acquired a teaspoon of that pale-blue juice which a German superstition regards as milk , modify the malignity of its strength in a bucket of tepid water and ring up the breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 6432 len. 25]: Mix the beverage in a cold cup , partake with moderation , and keep a wet rag around your head to guard against over-excitement .
Parsing [sent. 6433 len. 16]: TO CARVE FOWLS IN THE GERMAN FASHION Use a club , and avoid the joints .
Parsing [sent. 6434 len. 16]: CHAPTER L -LSB- Titian Bad and Titian Good -RSB- I wonder why some things are ?
Parsing [sent. 6435 len. 36]: For instance , Art is allowed as much indecent license today as in earlier times -- but the privileges of Literature in this respect have been sharply curtailed within the past eighty or ninety years .
Parsing [sent. 6436 len. 48]: Fielding and Smollett could portray the beastliness of their day in the beastliest language ; we have plenty of foul subjects to deal with in our day , but we are not allowed to approach them very near , even with nice and guarded forms of speech .
Parsing [sent. 6437 len. 6]: But not so with Art .
Parsing [sent. 6438 len. 15]: The brush may still deal freely with any subject , however revolting or indelicate .
Parsing [sent. 6439 len. 29]: It makes a body ooze sarcasm at every pore , to go about Rome and Florence and see what this last generation has been doing with the statues .
Parsing [sent. 6440 len. 17]: These works , which had stood in innocent nakedness for ages , are all fig-leaved now .
Parsing [sent. 6441 len. 7]: Yes , every one of them .
Parsing [sent. 6442 len. 22]: Nobody noticed their nakedness before , perhaps ; nobody can help noticing it now , the fig-leaf makes it so conspicuous .
Parsing [sent. 6443 len. 54]: But the comical thing about it all , is , that the fig-leaf is confined to cold and pallid marble , which would be still cold and unsuggestive without this sham and ostentatious symbol of modesty , whereas warm-blood paintings which do really need it have in no case been furnished with it .
Parsing [sent. 6444 len. 52]: At the door of the Uffizzi , in Florence , one is confronted by statues of a man and a woman , noseless , battered , black with accumulated grime -- they hardly suggest human beings -- yet these ridiculous creatures have been thoughtfully and conscientiously fig-leaved by this fastidious generation .
Parsing [sent. 6445 len. 55]: You enter , and proceed to that most-visited little gallery that exists in the world -- the Tribune -- and there , against the wall , without obstructing rag or leaf , you may look your fill upon the foulest , the vilest , the obscenest picture the world possesses -- Titian 's Venus .
Parsing [sent. 6446 len. 28]: It is n't that she is naked and stretched out on a bed -- no , it is the attitude of one of her arms and hand .
Parsing [sent. 6447 len. 53]: If I ventured to describe that attitude , there would be a fine howl -- but there the Venus lies , for anybody to gloat over that wants to -- and there she has a right to lie , for she is a work of art , and Art has its privileges .
Parsing [sent. 6448 len. 36]: I saw young girls stealing furtive glances at her ; I saw young men gaze long and absorbedly at her ; I saw aged , infirm men hang upon her charms with a pathetic interest .
Parsing [sent. 6449 len. 42]: How I should like to describe her -- just to see what a holy indignation I could stir up in the world -- just to hear the unreflecting average man deliver himself about my grossness and coarseness , and all that .
Parsing [sent. 6450 len. 59]: The world says that no worded description of a moving spectacle is a hundredth part as moving as the same spectacle seen with one 's own eyes -- yet the world is willing to let its son and its daughter and itself look at Titian 's beast , but wo n't stand a description of it in words .
Parsing [sent. 6451 len. 14]: Which shows that the world is not as consistent as it might be .
Parsing [sent. 6452 len. 19]: There are pictures of nude women which suggest no impure thought -- I am well aware of that .
Parsing [sent. 6453 len. 7]: I am not railing at such .
Parsing [sent. 6454 len. 23]: What I am trying to emphasize is the fact that Titian 's Venus is very far from being one of that sort .
Parsing [sent. 6455 len. 22]: Without any question it was painted for a bagnio and it was probably refused because it was a trifle too strong .
Parsing [sent. 6456 len. 16]: In truth , it is too strong for any place but a public Art Gallery .
Parsing [sent. 6457 len. 23]: Titian has two Venuses in the Tribune ; persons who have seen them will easily remember which one I am referring to .
Parsing [sent. 6458 len. 72]: In every gallery in Europe there are hideous pictures of blood , carnage , oozing brains , putrefaction -- pictures portraying intolerable suffering -- pictures alive with every conceivable horror , wrought out in dreadful detail -- and similar pictures are being put on the canvas every day and publicly exhibited -- without a growl from anybody -- for they are innocent , they are inoffensive , being works of art .
Parsing [sent. 6459 len. 28]: But suppose a literary artist ventured to go into a painstaking and elaborate description of one of these grisly things -- the critics would skin him alive .
Parsing [sent. 6460 len. 22]: Well , let it go , it can not be helped ; Art retains her privileges , Literature has lost hers .
Parsing [sent. 6461 len. 22]: Somebody else may cipher out the whys and the wherefores and the consistencies of it -- I have n't got time .
Parsing [sent. 6462 len. 24]: Titian 's Venus defiles and disgraces the Tribune , there is no softening that fact , but his `` Moses '' glorifies it .
Parsing [sent. 6463 len. 23]: The simple truthfulness of its noble work wins the heart and the applause of every visitor , be he learned or ignorant .
Parsing [sent. 6464 len. 54]: After wearying one 's self with the acres of stuffy , sappy , expressionless babies that populate the canvases of the Old Masters of Italy , it is refreshing to stand before this peerless child and feel that thrill which tells you you are at last in the presence of the real thing .
Parsing [sent. 6465 len. 10]: This is a human child , this is genuine .
Parsing [sent. 6466 len. 31]: You have seen him a thousand times -- you have seen him just as he is here -- and you confess , without reserve , that Titian WAS a Master .
Parsing [sent. 6467 len. 27]: The doll-faces of other painted babes may mean one thing , they may mean another , but with the `` Moses '' the case is different .
Parsing [sent. 6468 len. 28]: The most famous of all the art-critics has said , `` There is no room for doubt , here -- plainly this child is in trouble . ''
Parsing [sent. 6469 len. 28]: I consider that the `` Moses '' has no equal among the works of the Old Masters , except it be the divine Hair Trunk of Bassano .
Parsing [sent. 6470 len. 27]: I feel sure that if all the other Old Masters were lost and only these two preserved , the world would be the gainer by it .
Parsing [sent. 6471 len. 57]: My sole purpose in going to Florence was to see this immortal `` Moses , '' and by good fortune I was just in time , for they were already preparing to remove it to a more private and better-protected place because a fashion of robbing the great galleries was prevailing in Europe at the time .
Parsing [sent. 6472 len. 39]: I got a capable artist to copy the picture ; Pannemaker , the engraver of Doré 's books , engraved it for me , and I have the pleasure of laying it before the reader in this volume .
Parsing [sent. 6473 len. 49]: We took a turn to Rome and some other Italian cities -- then to Munich , and thence to Paris -- partly for exercise , but mainly because these things were in our projected program , and it was only right that we should be faithful to it .
Parsing [sent. 6474 len. 38]: From Paris I branched out and walked through Holland and Belgium , procuring an occasional lift by rail or canal when tired , and I had a tolerably good time of it `` by and large . ''
Parsing [sent. 6475 len. 14]: I worked Spain and other regions through agents to save time and shoe-leather .
Parsing [sent. 6476 len. 21]: We crossed to England , and then made the homeward passage in the Cunarder GALLIA , a very fine ship .
Parsing [sent. 6477 len. 34]: I was glad to get home -- immeasurably glad ; so glad , in fact , that it did not seem possible that anything could ever get me out of the country again .
Parsing [sent. 6478 len. 25]: I had not enjoyed a pleasure abroad which seemed to me to compare with the pleasure I felt in seeing New York harbor again .
Parsing [sent. 6479 len. 31]: Europe has many advantages which we have not , but they do not compensate for a good many still more valuable ones which exist nowhere but in our own country .
Parsing [sent. 6480 len. 13]: Then we are such a homeless lot when we are over there !
Parsing [sent. 6481 len. 9]: So are Europeans themselves , for that matter .
Parsing [sent. 6482 len. 18]: They live in dark and chilly vast tombs -- costly enough , maybe , but without conveniences .
Parsing [sent. 6483 len. 24]: To be condemned to live as the average European family lives would make life a pretty heavy burden to the average American family .
Parsing [sent. 6484 len. 19]: On the whole , I think that short visits to Europe are better for us than long ones .
Parsing [sent. 6485 len. 51]: The former preserve us from becoming Europeanized ; they keep our pride of country intact , and at the same time they intensify our affection for our country and our people ; whereas long visits have the effect of dulling those feelings -- at least in the majority of cases .
Parsing [sent. 6486 len. 18]: I think that one who mixes much with Americans long resident abroad must arrive at this conclusion .
Parsing [sent. 6487 len. 14]: APPENDIX Nothing gives such weight and dignity to a book as an Appendix .
Parsing [sent. 6488 len. 5]: -- HERODOTUS APPENDIX A .
Parsing [sent. 6489 len. 70]: The Portier Omar Khay'am , the poet-prophet of Persia , writing more than eight hundred years ago , has said : `` In the four parts of the earth are many that are able to write learned books , many that are able to lead armies , and many also that are able to govern kingdoms and empires ; but few there be that can keep a hotel . ''
Parsing [sent. 6490 len. 8]: A word about the European hotel PORTIER .
Parsing [sent. 6491 len. 12]: He is a most admirable invention , a most valuable convenience .
Parsing [sent. 6492 len. 59]: He always wears a conspicuous uniform ; he can always be found when he is wanted , for he sticks closely to his post at the front door ; he is as polite as a duke ; he speaks from four to ten languages ; he is your surest help and refuge in time of trouble or perplexity .
Parsing [sent. 6493 len. 28]: He is not the clerk , he is not the landlord ; he ranks above the clerk , and represents the landlord , who is seldom seen .
Parsing [sent. 6494 len. 21]: Instead of going to the clerk for information , as we do at home , you go to the portier .
Parsing [sent. 6495 len. 25]: It is the pride of our average hotel clerk to know nothing whatever ; it is the pride of the portier to know everything .
Parsing [sent. 6496 len. 120]: You ask the portier at what hours the trains leave -- he tells you instantly ; or you ask him who is the best physician in town ; or what is the hack tariff ; or how many children the mayor has ; or what days the galleries are open , and whether a permit is required , and where you are to get it , and what you must pay for it ; or when the theaters open and close , what the plays are to be , and the price of seats ; or what is the newest thing in hats ; or how the bills of mortality average ; or `` who struck Billy Patterson . ''
Parsing [sent. 6497 len. 37]: It does not matter what you ask him : in nine cases out of ten he knows , and in the tenth case he will find out for you before you can turn around three times .
Parsing [sent. 6498 len. 11]: There is nothing he will not put his hand to .
Parsing [sent. 6499 len. 50]: Suppose you tell him you wish to go from Hamburg to Peking by the way of Jericho , and are ignorant of routes and prices -- the next morning he will hand you a piece of paper with the whole thing worked out on it to the last detail .
Parsing [sent. 6500 len. 40]: Before you have been long on European soil , you find yourself still SAYING you are relying on Providence , but when you come to look closer you will see that in reality you are relying on the portier .
Parsing [sent. 6501 len. 41]: He discovers what is puzzling you , or what is troubling you , or what your need is , before you can get the half of it out , and he promptly says , `` Leave that to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 6502 len. 14]: Consequently , you easily drift into the habit of leaving everything to him .
Parsing [sent. 6503 len. 59]: There is a certain embarrassment about applying to the average American hotel clerk , a certain hesitancy , a sense of insecurity against rebuff ; but you feel no embarrassment in your intercourse with the portier ; he receives your propositions with an enthusiasm which cheers , and plunges into their accomplishment with an alacrity which almost inebriates .
Parsing [sent. 6504 len. 15]: The more requirements you can pile upon him , the better he likes it .
Parsing [sent. 6505 len. 14]: Of course the result is that you cease from doing anything for yourself .
Parsing [sent. 6506 len. 58]: He calls a hack when you want one ; puts you into it ; tells the driver whither to take you ; receives you like a long-lost child when you return ; sends you about your business , does all the quarreling with the hackman himself , and pays him his money out of his own pocket .
Parsing [sent. 6507 len. 88]: He sends for your theater tickets , and pays for them ; he sends for any possible article you can require , be it a doctor , an elephant , or a postage stamp ; and when you leave , at last , you will find a subordinate seated with the cab-driver who will put you in your railway compartment , buy your tickets , have your baggage weighed , bring you the printed tags , and tell you everything is in your bill and paid for .
Parsing [sent. 6508 len. 39]: At home you get such elaborate , excellent , and willing service as this only in the best hotels of our large cities ; but in Europe you get it in the mere back country-towns just as well .
Parsing [sent. 6509 len. 10]: What is the secret of the portier 's devotion ?
Parsing [sent. 6510 len. 13]: It is very simple : he gets FEES , AND NO SALARY .
Parsing [sent. 6511 len. 9]: His fee is pretty closely regulated , too .
Parsing [sent. 6512 len. 25]: If you stay a week , you give him five marks -- a dollar and a quarter , or about eighteen cents a day .
Parsing [sent. 6513 len. 12]: If you stay a month , you reduce this average somewhat .
Parsing [sent. 6514 len. 22]: If you stay two or three months or longer , you cut it down half , or even more than half .
Parsing [sent. 6515 len. 14]: If you stay only one day , you give the portier a mark .
Parsing [sent. 6516 len. 59]: The head waiter 's fee is a shade less than the portier 's ; the Boots , who not only blacks your boots and brushes your clothes , but is usually the porter and handles your baggage , gets a somewhat smaller fee than the head waiter ; the chambermaid 's fee ranks below that of the Boots .
Parsing [sent. 6517 len. 11]: You fee only these four , and no one else .
Parsing [sent. 6518 len. 55]: A German gentleman told me that when he remained a week in a hotel , he gave the portier five marks , the head waiter four , the Boots three , and the chambermaid two ; and if he stayed three months he divided ninety marks among them , in about the above proportions .
Parsing [sent. 6519 len. 6]: Ninety marks make $ 22.50 .
Parsing [sent. 6520 len. 61]: None of these fees are ever paid until you leave the hotel , though it be a year -- except one of these four servants should go away in the mean time ; in that case he will be sure to come and bid you good-by and give you the opportunity to pay him what is fairly coming to him .
Parsing [sent. 6521 len. 51]: It is considered very bad policy to fee a servant while you are still to remain longer in the hotel , because if you gave him too little he might neglect you afterward , and if you gave him too much he might neglect somebody else to attend to you .
Parsing [sent. 6522 len. 19]: It is considered best to keep his expectations `` on a string '' until your stay is concluded .
Parsing [sent. 6523 len. 37]: I do not know whether hotel servants in New York get any wages or not , but I do know that in some of the hotels there the feeing system in vogue is a heavy burden .
Parsing [sent. 6524 len. 12]: The waiter expects a quarter at breakfast -- and gets it .
Parsing [sent. 6525 len. 15]: You have a different waiter at luncheon , and so he gets a quarter .
Parsing [sent. 6526 len. 14]: Your waiter at dinner is another stranger -- consequently he gets a quarter .
Parsing [sent. 6527 len. 30]: The boy who carries your satchel to your room and lights your gas fumbles around and hangs around significantly , and you fee him to get rid of him .
Parsing [sent. 6528 len. 38]: Now you may ring for ice-water ; and ten minutes later for a lemonade ; and ten minutes afterward , for a cigar ; and by and by for a newspaper -- and what is the result ?
Parsing [sent. 6529 len. 21]: Why , a new boy has appeared every time and fooled and fumbled around until you have paid him something .
Parsing [sent. 6530 len. 21]: Suppose you boldly put your foot down , and say it is the hotel 's business to pay its servants ?
Parsing [sent. 6531 len. 39]: You will have to ring your bell ten or fifteen times before you get a servant there ; and when he goes off to fill your order you will grow old and infirm before you see him again .
Parsing [sent. 6532 len. 52]: You may struggle nobly for twenty-four hours , maybe , if you are an adamantine sort of person , but in the mean time you will have been so wretchedly served , and so insolently , that you will haul down your colors , and go to impoverishing yourself with fees .
Parsing [sent. 6533 len. 20]: It seems to me that it would be a happy idea to import the European feeing system into America .
Parsing [sent. 6534 len. 21]: I believe it would result in getting even the bells of the Philadelphia hotels answered , and cheerful service rendered .
Parsing [sent. 6535 len. 31]: The greatest American hotels keep a number of clerks and a cashier , and pay them salaries which mount up to a considerable total in the course of a year .
Parsing [sent. 6536 len. 22]: The great continental hotels keep a cashier on a trifling salary , and a portier WHO PAYS THE HOTEL A SALARY .
Parsing [sent. 6537 len. 21]: By the latter system both the hotel and the public save money and are better served than by our system .
Parsing [sent. 6538 len. 33]: One of our consuls told me that a portier of a great Berlin hotel paid five thousand dollars a year for his position , and yet cleared six thousand dollars for himself .
Parsing [sent. 6539 len. 43]: The position of portier in the chief hotels of Saratoga , Long Branch , New York , and similar centers of resort , would be one which the holder could afford to pay even more than five thousand dollars for , perhaps .
Parsing [sent. 6540 len. 25]: When we borrowed the feeing fashion from Europe a dozen years ago , the salary system ought to have been discontinued , of course .
Parsing [sent. 6541 len. 11]: We might make this correction now , I should think .
Parsing [sent. 6542 len. 9]: And we might add the portier , too .
Parsing [sent. 6543 len. 65]: Since I first began to study the portier , I have had opportunities to observe him in the chief cities of Germany , Switzerland , and Italy ; and the more I have seen of him the more I have wished that he might be adopted in America , and become there , as he is in Europe , the stranger 's guardian angel .
Parsing [sent. 6544 len. 27]: Yes , what was true eight hundred years ago , is just as true today : `` Few there be that can keep a hotel . ''
Parsing [sent. 6545 len. 23]: Perhaps it is because the landlords and their subordinates have in too many cases taken up their trade without first learning it .
Parsing [sent. 6546 len. 9]: In Europe the trade of hotel-keeper is taught .
Parsing [sent. 6547 len. 19]: The apprentice begins at the bottom of the ladder and masters the several grades one after the other .
Parsing [sent. 6548 len. 94]: Just as in our country printing-offices the apprentice first learns how to sweep out and bring water ; then learns to `` roll '' ; then to sort `` pi '' ; then to set type ; and finally rounds and completes his education with job-work and press-work ; so the landlord-apprentice serves as call-boy ; then as under-waiter ; then as a parlor waiter ; then as head waiter , in which position he often has to make out all the bills ; then as clerk or cashier ; then as portier .
Parsing [sent. 6549 len. 30]: His trade is learned now , and by and by he will assume the style and dignity of landlord , and be found conducting a hotel of his own .
Parsing [sent. 6550 len. 38]: Now in Europe , the same as in America , when a man has kept a hotel so thoroughly well during a number of years as to give it a great reputation , he has his reward .
Parsing [sent. 6551 len. 8]: He can live prosperously on that reputation .
Parsing [sent. 6552 len. 24]: He can let his hotel run down to the last degree of shabbiness and yet have it full of people all the time .
Parsing [sent. 6553 len. 13]: For instance , there is the Hotel de Ville , in Milan .
Parsing [sent. 6554 len. 27]: It swarms with mice and fleas , and if the rest of the world were destroyed it could furnish dirt enough to start another one with .
Parsing [sent. 6555 len. 47]: The food would create an insurrection in a poorhouse ; and yet if you go outside to get your meals that hotel makes up its loss by overcharging you on all sorts of trifles -- and without making any denials or excuses about it , either .
Parsing [sent. 6556 len. 32]: But the Hotel de Ville 's old excellent reputation still keeps its dreary rooms crowded with travelers who would be elsewhere if they had only some wise friend to warn them .
Parsing [sent. 6557 len. 25]: APPENDIX B. Heidelberg Castle Heidelberg Castle must have been very beautiful before the French battered and bruised and scorched it two hundred years ago .
Parsing [sent. 6558 len. 18]: The stone is brown , with a pinkish tint , and does not seem to stain easily .
Parsing [sent. 6559 len. 35]: The dainty and elaborate ornamentation upon its two chief fronts is as delicately carved as if it had been intended for the interior of a drawing-room rather than for the outside of a house .
Parsing [sent. 6560 len. 27]: Many fruit and flower clusters , human heads and grim projecting lions ' heads are still as perfect in every detail as if they were new .
Parsing [sent. 6561 len. 12]: But the statues which are ranked between the windows have suffered .
Parsing [sent. 6562 len. 22]: These are life-size statues of old-time emperors , electors , and similar grandees , clad in mail and bearing ponderous swords .
Parsing [sent. 6563 len. 21]: Some have lost an arm , some a head , and one poor fellow is chopped off at the middle .
Parsing [sent. 6564 len. 37]: There is a saying that if a stranger will pass over the drawbridge and walk across the court to the castle front without saying anything , he can make a wish and it will be fulfilled .
Parsing [sent. 6565 len. 50]: But they say that the truth of this thing has never had a chance to be proved , for the reason that before any stranger can walk from the drawbridge to the appointed place , the beauty of the palace front will extort an exclamation of delight from him .
Parsing [sent. 6566 len. 11]: A ruin must be rightly situated , to be effective .
Parsing [sent. 6567 len. 9]: This one could not have been better placed .
Parsing [sent. 6568 len. 57]: It stands upon a commanding elevation , it is buried in green woods , there is no level ground about it , but , on the contrary , there are wooded terraces upon terraces , and one looks down through shining leaves into profound chasms and abysses where twilight reigns and the sun can not intrude .
Parsing [sent. 6569 len. 13]: Nature knows how to garnish a ruin to get the best effect .
Parsing [sent. 6570 len. 18]: One of these old towers is split down the middle , and one half has tumbled aside .
Parsing [sent. 6571 len. 15]: It tumbled in such a way as to establish itself in a picturesque attitude .
Parsing [sent. 6572 len. 35]: Then all it lacked was a fitting drapery , and Nature has furnished that ; she has robed the rugged mass in flowers and verdure , and made it a charm to the eye .
Parsing [sent. 6573 len. 33]: The standing half exposes its arched and cavernous rooms to you , like open , toothless mouths ; there , too , the vines and flowers have done their work of grace .
Parsing [sent. 6574 len. 32]: The rear portion of the tower has not been neglected , either , but is clothed with a clinging garment of polished ivy which hides the wounds and stains of time .
Parsing [sent. 6575 len. 20]: Even the top is not left bare , but is crowned with a flourishing group of trees and shrubs .
Parsing [sent. 6576 len. 20]: Misfortune has done for this old tower what it has done for the human character sometimes -- improved it .
Parsing [sent. 6577 len. 50]: A gentleman remarked , one day , that it might have been fine to live in the castle in the day of its prime , but that we had one advantage which its vanished inhabitants lacked -- the advantage of having a charming ruin to visit and muse over .
Parsing [sent. 6578 len. 7]: But that was a hasty idea .
Parsing [sent. 6579 len. 8]: Those people had the advantage of US .
Parsing [sent. 6580 len. 26]: They had the fine castle to live in , and they could cross the Rhine valley and muse over the stately ruin of Trifels besides .
Parsing [sent. 6581 len. 31]: The Trifels people , in their day , five hundred years ago , could go and muse over majestic ruins that have vanished , now , to the last stone .
Parsing [sent. 6582 len. 37]: There have always been ruins , no doubt ; and there have always been pensive people to sigh over them , and asses to scratch upon them their names and the important date of their visit .
Parsing [sent. 6583 len. 90]: Within a hundred years after Adam left Eden , the guide probably gave the usual general flourish with his hand and said : `` Place where the animals were named , ladies and gentlemen ; place where the tree of the forbidden fruit stood ; exact spot where Adam and Eve first met ; and here , ladies and gentlemen , adorned and hallowed by the names and addresses of three generations of tourists , we have the crumbling remains of Cain 's altar -- fine old ruin ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6584 len. 16]: Then , no doubt , he taxed them a shekel apiece and let them go .
Parsing [sent. 6585 len. 13]: An illumination of Heidelberg Castle is one of the sights of Europe .
Parsing [sent. 6586 len. 34]: The Castle 's picturesque shape ; its commanding situation , midway up the steep and wooded mountainside ; its vast size -- these features combine to make an illumination a most effective spectacle .
Parsing [sent. 6587 len. 12]: It is necessarily an expensive show , and consequently rather infrequent .
Parsing [sent. 6588 len. 31]: Therefore whenever one of these exhibitions is to take place , the news goes about in the papers and Heidelberg is sure to be full of people on that night .
Parsing [sent. 6589 len. 14]: I and my agent had one of these opportunities , and improved it .
Parsing [sent. 6590 len. 38]: About half past seven on the appointed evening we crossed the lower bridge , with some American students , in a pouring rain , and started up the road which borders the Neunheim side of the river .
Parsing [sent. 6591 len. 26]: This roadway was densely packed with carriages and foot-passengers ; the former of all ages , and the latter of all ages and both sexes .
Parsing [sent. 6592 len. 21]: This black and solid mass was struggling painfully onward , through the slop , the darkness , and the deluge .
Parsing [sent. 6593 len. 24]: We waded along for three-quarters of a mile , and finally took up a position in an unsheltered beer-garden directly opposite the Castle .
Parsing [sent. 6594 len. 42]: We could not SEE the Castle -- or anything else , for that matter -- but we could dimly discern the outlines of the mountain over the way , through the pervading blackness , and knew whereabouts the Castle was located .
Parsing [sent. 6595 len. 33]: We stood on one of the hundred benches in the garden , under our umbrellas ; the other ninety-nine were occupied by standing men and women , and they also had umbrellas .
Parsing [sent. 6596 len. 30]: All the region round about , and up and down the river-road , was a dense wilderness of humanity hidden under an unbroken pavement of carriage tops and umbrellas .
Parsing [sent. 6597 len. 8]: Thus we stood during two drenching hours .
Parsing [sent. 6598 len. 43]: No rain fell on my head , but the converging whalebone points of a dozen neighboring umbrellas poured little cooling steams of water down my neck , and sometimes into my ears , and thus kept me from getting hot and impatient .
Parsing [sent. 6599 len. 17]: I had the rheumatism , too , and had heard that this was good for it .
Parsing [sent. 6600 len. 19]: Afterward , however , I was led to believe that the water treatment is NOT good for rheumatism .
Parsing [sent. 6601 len. 10]: There were even little girls in that dreadful place .
Parsing [sent. 6602 len. 31]: A man held one in his arms , just in front of me , for as much as an hour , with umbrella-drippings soaking into her clothing all the time .
Parsing [sent. 6603 len. 30]: In the circumstances , two hours was a good while for us to have to wait , but when the illumination did at last come , we felt repaid .
Parsing [sent. 6604 len. 20]: It came unexpectedly , of course -- things always do , that have been long looked and longed for .
Parsing [sent. 6605 len. 57]: With a perfectly breath-taking suddenness several mast sheaves of varicolored rockets were vomited skyward out of the black throats of the Castle towers , accompanied by a thundering crash of sound , and instantly every detail of the prodigious ruin stood revealed against the mountainside and glowing with an almost intolerable splendor of fire and color .
Parsing [sent. 6606 len. 57]: For some little time the whole building was a blinding crimson mass , the towers continued to spout thick columns of rockets aloft , and overhead the sky was radiant with arrowy bolts which clove their way to the zenith , paused , curved gracefully downward , then burst into brilliant fountain-sprays of richly colored sparks .
Parsing [sent. 6607 len. 69]: The red fires died slowly down , within the Castle , and presently the shell grew nearly black outside ; the angry glare that shone out through the broken arches and innumerable sashless windows , now , reproduced the aspect which the Castle must have borne in the old time when the French spoilers saw the monster bonfire which they had made there fading and spoiling toward extinction .
Parsing [sent. 6608 len. 46]: While we still gazed and enjoyed , the ruin was suddenly enveloped in rolling and rumbling volumes of vaporous green fire ; then in dazzling purple ones ; then a mixture of many colors followed , then drowned the great fabric in its blended splendors .
Parsing [sent. 6609 len. 59]: Meantime the nearest bridge had been illuminated , and from several rafts anchored in the river , meteor showers of rockets , Roman candles , bombs , serpents , and Catharine wheels were being discharged in wasteful profusion into the sky -- a marvelous sight indeed to a person as little used to such spectacles as I was .
Parsing [sent. 6610 len. 26]: For a while the whole region about us seemed as bright as day , and yet the rain was falling in torrents all the time .
Parsing [sent. 6611 len. 22]: The evening 's entertainment presently closed , and we joined the innumerable caravan of half-drowned strangers , and waded home again .
Parsing [sent. 6612 len. 52]: The Castle grounds are very ample and very beautiful ; and as they joined the Hotel grounds , with no fences to climb , but only some nobly shaded stone stairways to descend , we spent a part of nearly every day in idling through their smooth walks and leafy groves .
Parsing [sent. 6613 len. 42]: There was an attractive spot among the trees where were a great many wooden tables and benches ; and there one could sit in the shade and pretend to sip at his foamy beaker of beer while he inspected the crowd .
Parsing [sent. 6614 len. 15]: I say pretend , because I only pretended to sip , without really sipping .
Parsing [sent. 6615 len. 22]: That is the polite way ; but when you are ready to go , you empty the beaker at a draught .
Parsing [sent. 6616 len. 14]: There was a brass band , and it furnished excellent music every afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 6617 len. 15]: Sometimes so many people came that every seat was occupied , every table filled .
Parsing [sent. 6618 len. 56]: And never a rough in the assemblage -- all nicely dressed fathers and mothers , young gentlemen and ladies and children ; and plenty of university students and glittering officers ; with here and there a gray professor , or a peaceful old lady with her knitting ; and always a sprinkling of gawky foreigners .
Parsing [sent. 6619 len. 81]: Everybody had his glass of beer before him , or his cup of coffee , or his bottle of wine , or his hot cutlet and potatoes ; young ladies chatted , or fanned themselves , or wrought at their crocheting or embroidering ; the students fed sugar to their dogs , or discussed duels , or illustrated new fencing tricks with their little canes ; and everywhere was comfort and enjoyment , and everywhere peace and good-will to men .
Parsing [sent. 6620 len. 14]: The trees were jubilant with birds , and the paths with rollicking children .
Parsing [sent. 6621 len. 32]: One could have a seat in that place and plenty of music , any afternoon , for about eight cents , or a family ticket for the season for two dollars .
Parsing [sent. 6622 len. 43]: For a change , when you wanted one , you could stroll to the Castle , and burrow among its dungeons , or climb about its ruined towers , or visit its interior shows -- the great Heidelberg Tun , for instance .
Parsing [sent. 6623 len. 19]: Everybody has heard of the great Heidelberg Tun , and most people have seen it , no doubt .
Parsing [sent. 6624 len. 31]: It is a wine-cask as big as a cottage , and some traditions say it holds eighteen thousand bottles , and other traditions say it holds eighteen hundred million barrels .
Parsing [sent. 6625 len. 20]: I think it likely that one of these statements is a mistake , and the other is a lie .
Parsing [sent. 6626 len. 32]: However , the mere matter of capacity is a thing of no sort of consequence , since the cask is empty , and indeed has always been empty , history says .
Parsing [sent. 6627 len. 16]: An empty cask the size of a cathedral could excite but little emotion in me .
Parsing [sent. 6628 len. 34]: I do not see any wisdom in building a monster cask to hoard up emptiness in , when you can get a better quality , outside , any day , free of expense .
Parsing [sent. 6629 len. 9]: What could this cask have been built for ?
Parsing [sent. 6630 len. 15]: The more one studies over that , the more uncertain and unhappy he becomes .
Parsing [sent. 6631 len. 26]: Some historians say that thirty couples , some say thirty thousand couples , can dance on the head of this cask at the same time .
Parsing [sent. 6632 len. 15]: Even this does not seem to me to account for the building of it .
Parsing [sent. 6633 len. 9]: It does not even throw light on it .
Parsing [sent. 6634 len. 42]: A profound and scholarly Englishman -- a specialist -- who had made the great Heidelberg Tun his sole study for fifteen years , told me he had at last satisfied himself that the ancients built it to make German cream in .
Parsing [sent. 6635 len. 38]: He said that the average German cow yielded from one to two and half teaspoons of milk , when she was not worked in the plow or the hay-wagon more than eighteen or nineteen hours a day .
Parsing [sent. 6636 len. 35]: This milk was very sweet and good , and a beautiful transparent bluish tint ; but in order to get cream from it in the most economical way , a peculiar process was necessary .
Parsing [sent. 6637 len. 49]: Now he believed that the habit of the ancients was to collect several milkings in a teacup , pour it into the Great Tun , fill up with water , and then skim off the cream from time to time as the needs of the German Empire demanded .
Parsing [sent. 6638 len. 6]: This began to look reasonable .
Parsing [sent. 6639 len. 23]: It certainly began to account for the German cream which I had encountered and marveled over in so many hotels and restaurants .
Parsing [sent. 6640 len. 39]: But a thought struck me -- `` Why did not each ancient dairyman take his own teacup of milk and his own cask of water , and mix them , without making a government matter of it ? '
Parsing [sent. 6641 len. 18]: `` Where could he get a cask large enough to contain the right proportion of water ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6642 len. 3]: Very true .
Parsing [sent. 6643 len. 14]: It was plain that the Englishman had studied the matter from all sides .
Parsing [sent. 6644 len. 40]: Still I thought I might catch him on one point ; so I asked him why the modern empire did not make the nation 's cream in the Heidelberg Tun , instead of leaving it to rot away unused .
Parsing [sent. 6645 len. 42]: But he answered as one prepared -- `` A patient and diligent examination of the modern German cream had satisfied me that they do not use the Great Tun now , because they have got a BIGGER one hid away somewhere .
Parsing [sent. 6646 len. 24]: Either that is the case or they empty the spring milkings into the mountain torrents and then skim the Rhine all summer . ''
Parsing [sent. 6647 len. 24]: There is a museum of antiquities in the Castle , and among its most treasured relics are ancient manuscripts connected with German history .
Parsing [sent. 6648 len. 15]: There are hundreds of these , and their dates stretch back through many centuries .
Parsing [sent. 6649 len. 23]: One of them is a decree signed and sealed by the hand of a successor of Charlemagne , in the year 896 .
Parsing [sent. 6650 len. 29]: A signature made by a hand which vanished out of this life near a thousand years ago , is a more impressive thing than even a ruined castle .
Parsing [sent. 6651 len. 24]: Luther 's wedding-ring was shown me ; also a fork belonging to a time anterior to our era , and an early bootjack .
Parsing [sent. 6652 len. 20]: And there was a plaster cast of the head of a man who was assassinated about sixty years ago .
Parsing [sent. 6653 len. 11]: The stab-wounds in the face were duplicated with unpleasant fidelity .
Parsing [sent. 6654 len. 15]: One or two real hairs still remained sticking in the eyebrows of the cast .
Parsing [sent. 6655 len. 12]: That trifle seemed to almost change the counterfeit into a corpse .
Parsing [sent. 6656 len. 23]: There are many aged portraits -- some valuable , some worthless ; some of great interest , some of none at all .
Parsing [sent. 6657 len. 27]: I bought a couple -- one a gorgeous duke of the olden time , and the other a comely blue-eyed damsel , a princess , maybe .
Parsing [sent. 6658 len. 12]: I bought them to start a portrait-gallery of my ancestors with .
Parsing [sent. 6659 len. 17]: I paid a dollar and a half for the duke and a half for the princess .
Parsing [sent. 6660 len. 29]: One can lay in ancestors at even cheaper rates than these , in Europe , if he will mouse among old picture shops and look out for chances .
Parsing [sent. 6661 len. 3]: APPENDIX C .
Parsing [sent. 6662 len. 26]: The College Prison It seems that the student may break a good many of the public laws without having to answer to the public authorities .
Parsing [sent. 6663 len. 12]: His case must come before the University for trial and punishment .
Parsing [sent. 6664 len. 51]: If a policeman catches him in an unlawful act and proceeds to arrest him , the offender proclaims that he is a student , and perhaps shows his matriculation card , whereupon the officer asks for his address , then goes his way , and reports the matter at headquarters .
Parsing [sent. 6665 len. 32]: If the offense is one over which the city has no jurisdiction , the authorities report the case officially to the University , and give themselves no further concern about it .
Parsing [sent. 6666 len. 17]: The University court send for the student , listen to the evidence , and pronounce judgment .
Parsing [sent. 6667 len. 11]: The punishment usually inflicted is imprisonment in the University prison .
Parsing [sent. 6668 len. 19]: As I understand it , a student 's case is often tried without his being present at all .
Parsing [sent. 6669 len. 52]: Then something like this happens : A constable in the service of the University visits the lodgings of the said student , knocks , is invited to come in , does so , and says politely -- `` If you please , I am here to conduct you to prison . ''
Parsing [sent. 6670 len. 15]: `` Ah , '' says the student , `` I was not expecting it .
Parsing [sent. 6671 len. 7]: What have I been doing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6672 len. 17]: `` Two weeks ago the public peace had the honor to be disturbed by you . ''
Parsing [sent. 6673 len. 10]: `` It is true ; I had forgotten it .
Parsing [sent. 6674 len. 20]: Very well : I have been complained of , tried , and found guilty -- is that it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6675 len. 3]: `` Exactly .
Parsing [sent. 6676 len. 23]: You are sentenced to two days ' solitary confinement in the College prison , and I am sent to fetch you . ''
Parsing [sent. 6677 len. 2]: STUDENT .
Parsing [sent. 6678 len. 10]: `` O , I ca n't go today . ''
Parsing [sent. 6679 len. 2]: OFFICER .
Parsing [sent. 6680 len. 8]: `` If you please -- why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6681 len. 2]: STUDENT .
Parsing [sent. 6682 len. 9]: `` Because I 've got an engagement . ''
Parsing [sent. 6683 len. 2]: OFFICER .
Parsing [sent. 6684 len. 8]: `` Tomorrow , then , perhaps ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6685 len. 2]: STUDENT .
Parsing [sent. 6686 len. 13]: `` No , I am going to the opera , tomorrow . ''
Parsing [sent. 6687 len. 2]: OFFICER .
Parsing [sent. 6688 len. 7]: `` Could you come Friday ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6689 len. 2]: STUDENT .
Parsing [sent. 6690 len. 4]: -LRB- Reflectively . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 6691 len. 9]: `` Let me see -- Friday -- Friday .
Parsing [sent. 6692 len. 12]: I do n't seem to have anything on hand Friday . ''
Parsing [sent. 6693 len. 2]: OFFICER .
Parsing [sent. 6694 len. 15]: `` Then , if you please , I will expect you on Friday . ''
Parsing [sent. 6695 len. 2]: STUDENT .
Parsing [sent. 6696 len. 11]: `` All right , I 'll come around Friday . ''
Parsing [sent. 6697 len. 2]: OFFICER .
Parsing [sent. 6698 len. 4]: `` Thank you .
Parsing [sent. 6699 len. 6]: Good day , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 6700 len. 2]: STUDENT .
Parsing [sent. 6701 len. 5]: `` Good day . ''
Parsing [sent. 6702 len. 18]: So on Friday the student goes to the prison of his own accord , and is admitted .
Parsing [sent. 6703 len. 18]: It is questionable if the world 's criminal history can show a custom more odd than this .
Parsing [sent. 6704 len. 9]: Nobody knows , now , how it originated .
Parsing [sent. 6705 len. 49]: There have always been many noblemen among the students , and it is presumed that all students are gentlemen ; in the old times it was usual to mar the convenience of such folk as little as possible ; perhaps this indulgent custom owes its origin to this .
Parsing [sent. 6706 len. 51]: One day I was listening to some conversation upon this subject when an American student said that for some time he had been under sentence for a slight breach of the peace and had promised the constable that he would presently find an unoccupied day and betake himself to prison .
Parsing [sent. 6707 len. 42]: I asked the young gentleman to do me the kindness to go to jail as soon as he conveniently could , so that I might try to get in there and visit him , and see what college captivity was like .
Parsing [sent. 6708 len. 13]: He said he would appoint the very first day he could spare .
Parsing [sent. 6709 len. 8]: His confinement was to endure twenty-four hours .
Parsing [sent. 6710 len. 11]: He shortly chose his day , and sent me word .
Parsing [sent. 6711 len. 4]: I started immediately .
Parsing [sent. 6712 len. 46]: When I reached the University Place , I saw two gentlemen talking together , and , as they had portfolios under their arms , I judged they were tutors or elderly students ; so I asked them in English to show me the college jail .
Parsing [sent. 6713 len. 29]: I had learned to take it for granted that anybody in Germany who knows anything , knows English , so I had stopped afflicting people with my German .
Parsing [sent. 6714 len. 33]: These gentlemen seemed a trifle amused -- and a trifle confused , too -- but one of them said he would walk around the corner with me and show me the place .
Parsing [sent. 6715 len. 23]: He asked me why I wanted to get in there , and I said to see a friend -- and for curiosity .
Parsing [sent. 6716 len. 23]: He doubted if I would be admitted , but volunteered to put in a word or two for me with the custodian .
Parsing [sent. 6717 len. 38]: He rang the bell , a door opened , and we stepped into a paved way and then up into a small living-room , where we were received by a hearty and good-natured German woman of fifty .
Parsing [sent. 6718 len. 16]: She threw up her hands with a surprised `` ACH GOTT , HERR PROFESSOR ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6719 len. 10]: and exhibited a mighty deference for my new acquaintance .
Parsing [sent. 6720 len. 17]: By the sparkle in her eye I judged she was a good deal amused , too .
Parsing [sent. 6721 len. 32]: The `` Herr Professor '' talked to her in German , and I understood enough of it to know that he was bringing very plausible reasons to bear for admitting me .
Parsing [sent. 6722 len. 4]: They were successful .
Parsing [sent. 6723 len. 11]: So the Herr Professor received my earnest thanks and departed .
Parsing [sent. 6724 len. 31]: The old dame got her keys , took me up two or three flights of stairs , unlocked a door , and we stood in the presence of the criminal .
Parsing [sent. 6725 len. 31]: Then she went into a jolly and eager description of all that had occurred downstairs , and what the Herr Professor had said , and so forth and so on .
Parsing [sent. 6726 len. 25]: Plainly , she regarded it as quite a superior joke that I had waylaid a Professor and employed him in so odd a service .
Parsing [sent. 6727 len. 23]: But I would n't have done it if I had known he was a Professor ; therefore my conscience was not disturbed .
Parsing [sent. 6728 len. 8]: Now the dame left us to ourselves .
Parsing [sent. 6729 len. 20]: The cell was not a roomy one ; still it was a little larger than an ordinary prison cell .
Parsing [sent. 6730 len. 86]: It had a window of good size , iron-grated ; a small stove ; two wooden chairs ; two oaken tables , very old and most elaborately carved with names , mottoes , faces , armorial bearings , etc. -- the work of several generations of imprisoned students ; and a narrow wooden bedstead with a villainous straw mattress , but no sheets , pillows , blankets , or coverlets -- for these the student must furnish at his own cost if he wants them .
Parsing [sent. 6731 len. 8]: There was no carpet , of course .
Parsing [sent. 6732 len. 17]: The ceiling was completely covered with names , dates , and monograms , done with candle-smoke .
Parsing [sent. 6733 len. 65]: The walls were thickly covered with pictures and portraits -LRB- in profile -RRB- , some done with ink , some with soot , some with a pencil , and some with red , blue , and green chalks ; and whenever an inch or two of space had remained between the pictures , the captives had written plaintive verses , or names and dates .
Parsing [sent. 6734 len. 14]: I do not think I was ever in a more elaborately frescoed apartment .
Parsing [sent. 6735 len. 11]: Against the wall hung a placard containing the prison laws .
Parsing [sent. 6736 len. 11]: I made a note of one or two of these .
Parsing [sent. 6737 len. 62]: For instance : The prisoner must pay , for the `` privilege '' of entering , a sum equivalent to 20 cents of our money ; for the privilege of leaving , when his term had expired , 20 cents ; for every day spent in the prison , 12 cents ; for fire and light , 12 cents a day .
Parsing [sent. 6738 len. 36]: The jailer furnishes coffee , mornings , for a small sum ; dinners and suppers may be ordered from outside if the prisoner chooses -- and he is allowed to pay for them , too .
Parsing [sent. 6739 len. 30]: Here and there , on the walls , appeared the names of American students , and in one place the American arms and motto were displayed in colored chalks .
Parsing [sent. 6740 len. 13]: With the help of my friend I translated many of the inscriptions .
Parsing [sent. 6741 len. 10]: Some of them were cheerful , others the reverse .
Parsing [sent. 6742 len. 30]: I will give the reader a few specimens : `` In my tenth semester -LRB- my best one -RRB- , I am cast here through the complaints of others .
Parsing [sent. 6743 len. 9]: Let those who follow me take warning . ''
Parsing [sent. 6744 len. 10]: `` III TAGE OHNE GRUND ANGEBLICH AUS NEUGIERDE . ''
Parsing [sent. 6745 len. 32]: Which is to say , he had a curiosity to know what prison life was like ; so he made a breach in some law and got three days for it .
Parsing [sent. 6746 len. 14]: It is more than likely that he never had the same curiosity again .
Parsing [sent. 6747 len. 4]: -LRB- TRANSLATION . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 6748 len. 17]: `` E. Glinicke , four days for being too eager a spectator of a row . ''
Parsing [sent. 6749 len. 13]: `` F. Graf Bismarck -- 27-29 , II , ' 74 . ''
Parsing [sent. 6750 len. 20]: Which means that Count Bismarck , son of the great statesman , was a prisoner two days in 1874 .
Parsing [sent. 6751 len. 4]: -LRB- TRANSLATION . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 6752 len. 11]: `` R. Diergandt -- for Love -- 4 days . ''
Parsing [sent. 6753 len. 15]: Many people in this world have caught it heavier than for the same indiscretion .
Parsing [sent. 6754 len. 5]: This one is terse .
Parsing [sent. 6755 len. 11]: I translate : `` Four weeks for MISINTERPRETED GALLANTRY . ''
Parsing [sent. 6756 len. 11]: I wish the sufferer had explained a little more fully .
Parsing [sent. 6757 len. 9]: A four-week term is a rather serious matter .
Parsing [sent. 6758 len. 16]: There were many uncomplimentary references , on the walls , to a certain unpopular dignitary .
Parsing [sent. 6759 len. 11]: One sufferer had got three days for not saluting him .
Parsing [sent. 6760 len. 37]: Another had `` here two days slept and three nights lain awake , '' on account of this same `` Dr. K. '' In one place was a picture of Dr. K. hanging on a gallows .
Parsing [sent. 6761 len. 19]: Here and there , lonesome prisoners had eased the heavy time by altering the records left by predecessors .
Parsing [sent. 6762 len. 38]: Leaving the name standing , and the date and length of the captivity , they had erased the description of the misdemeanor , and written in its place , in staring capitals , `` FOR THEFT ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6763 len. 6]: or `` FOR MURDER ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6764 len. 6]: or some other gaudy crime .
Parsing [sent. 6765 len. 17]: In one place , all by itself , stood this blood-curdling word : `` Rache ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6766 len. 5]: -LSB- 1 -RSB- 1 .
Parsing [sent. 6767 len. 4]: `` Revenge ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6768 len. 10]: There was no name signed , and no date .
Parsing [sent. 6769 len. 10]: It was an inscription well calculated to pique curiosity .
Parsing [sent. 6770 len. 34]: One would greatly like to know the nature of the wrong that had been done , and what sort of vengeance was wanted , and whether the prisoner ever achieved it or not .
Parsing [sent. 6771 len. 11]: But there was no way of finding out these things .
Parsing [sent. 6772 len. 33]: Occasionally , a name was followed simply by the remark , `` II days , for disturbing the peace , '' and without comment upon the justice or injustice of the sentence .
Parsing [sent. 6773 len. 39]: In one place was a hilarious picture of a student of the green cap corps with a bottle of champagne in each hand ; and below was the legend : `` These make an evil fate endurable . ''
Parsing [sent. 6774 len. 23]: There were two prison cells , and neither had space left on walls or ceiling for another name or portrait or picture .
Parsing [sent. 6775 len. 32]: The inside surfaces of the two doors were completely covered with CARTES DE VISITE of former prisoners , ingeniously let into the wood and protected from dirt and injury by glass .
Parsing [sent. 6776 len. 32]: I very much wanted one of the sorry old tables which the prisoners had spent so many years in ornamenting with their pocket-knives , but red tape was in the way .
Parsing [sent. 6777 len. 57]: The custodian could not sell one without an order from a superior ; and that superior would have to get it from HIS superior ; and this one would have to get it from a higher one -- and so on up and up until the faculty should sit on the matter and deliver final judgment .
Parsing [sent. 6778 len. 31]: The system was right , and nobody could find fault with it ; but it did not seem justifiable to bother so many people , so I proceeded no further .
Parsing [sent. 6779 len. 44]: It might have cost me more than I could afford , anyway ; for one of those prison tables , which was at the time in a private museum in Heidelberg , was afterward sold at auction for two hundred and fifty dollars .
Parsing [sent. 6780 len. 26]: It was not worth more than a dollar , or possibly a dollar and half , before the captive students began their work on it .
Parsing [sent. 6781 len. 27]: Persons who saw it at the auction said it was so curiously and wonderfully carved that it was worth the money that was paid for it .
Parsing [sent. 6782 len. 39]: Among them many who have tasted the college prison 's dreary hospitality was a lively young fellow from one of the Southern states of America , whose first year 's experience of German university life was rather peculiar .
Parsing [sent. 6783 len. 65]: The day he arrived in Heidelberg he enrolled his name on the college books , and was so elated with the fact that his dearest hope had found fruition and he was actually a student of the old and renowned university , that he set to work that very night to celebrate the event by a grand lark in company with some other students .
Parsing [sent. 6784 len. 23]: In the course of his lark he managed to make a wide breach in one of the university 's most stringent laws .
Parsing [sent. 6785 len. 20]: Sequel : before noon , next day , he was in the college prison -- booked for three months .
Parsing [sent. 6786 len. 17]: The twelve long weeks dragged slowly by , and the day of deliverance came at last .
Parsing [sent. 6787 len. 46]: A great crowd of sympathizing fellow-students received him with a rousing demonstration as he came forth , and of course there was another grand lark -- in the course of which he managed to make a wide breach of the CITY 'S most stringent laws .
Parsing [sent. 6788 len. 21]: Sequel : before noon , next day , he was safe in the city lockup -- booked for three months .
Parsing [sent. 6789 len. 69]: This second tedious captivity drew to an end in the course of time , and again a great crowd of sympathizing fellow students gave him a rousing reception as he came forth ; but his delight in his freedom was so boundless that he could not proceed soberly and calmly , but must go hopping and skipping and jumping down the sleety street from sheer excess of joy .
Parsing [sent. 6790 len. 21]: Sequel : he slipped and broke his leg , and actually lay in the hospital during the next three months !
Parsing [sent. 6791 len. 88]: When he at last became a free man again , he said he believed he would hunt up a brisker seat of learning ; the Heidelberg lectures might be good , but the opportunities of attending them were too rare , the educational process too slow ; he said he had come to Europe with the idea that the acquirement of an education was only a matter of time , but if he had averaged the Heidelberg system correctly , it was rather a matter of eternity .
Parsing [sent. 6792 len. 3]: APPENDIX D .
Parsing [sent. 6793 len. 13]: The Awful German Language A little learning makes the whole world kin .
Parsing [sent. 6794 len. 6]: -- Proverbs xxxii , 7 .
Parsing [sent. 6795 len. 27]: I went often to look at the collection of curiosities in Heidelberg Castle , and one day I surprised the keeper of it with my German .
Parsing [sent. 6796 len. 7]: I spoke entirely in that language .
Parsing [sent. 6797 len. 35]: He was greatly interested ; and after I had talked a while he said my German was very rare , possibly a `` unique '' ; and wanted to add it to his museum .
Parsing [sent. 6798 len. 29]: If he had known what it had cost me to acquire my art , he would also have known that it would break any collector to buy it .
Parsing [sent. 6799 len. 48]: Harris and I had been hard at work on our German during several weeks at that time , and although we had made good progress , it had been accomplished under great difficulty and annoyance , for three of our teachers had died in the mean time .
Parsing [sent. 6800 len. 19]: A person who has not studied German can form no idea of what a perplexing language it is .
Parsing [sent. 6801 len. 22]: Surely there is not another language that is so slipshod and systemless , and so slippery and elusive to the grasp .
Parsing [sent. 6802 len. 71]: One is washed about in it , hither and thither , in the most helpless way ; and when at last he thinks he has captured a rule which offers firm ground to take a rest on amid the general rage and turmoil of the ten parts of speech , he turns over the page and reads , `` Let the pupil make careful note of the following EXCEPTIONS . ''
Parsing [sent. 6803 len. 20]: He runs his eye down and finds that there are more exceptions to the rule than instances of it .
Parsing [sent. 6804 len. 16]: So overboard he goes again , to hunt for another Ararat and find another quicksand .
Parsing [sent. 6805 len. 12]: Such has been , and continues to be , my experience .
Parsing [sent. 6806 len. 48]: Every time I think I have got one of these four confusing `` cases '' where I am master of it , a seemingly insignificant preposition intrudes itself into my sentence , clothed with an awful and unsuspected power , and crumbles the ground from under me .
Parsing [sent. 6807 len. 36]: For instance , my book inquires after a certain bird -- -LRB- it is always inquiring after things which are of no sort of consequence to anybody -RRB- : `` Where is the bird ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6808 len. 28]: Now the answer to this question -- according to the book -- is that the bird is waiting in the blacksmith shop on account of the rain .
Parsing [sent. 6809 len. 17]: Of course no bird would do that , but then you must stick to the book .
Parsing [sent. 6810 len. 14]: Very well , I begin to cipher out the German for that answer .
Parsing [sent. 6811 len. 16]: I begin at the wrong end , necessarily , for that is the German idea .
Parsing [sent. 6812 len. 32]: I say to myself , `` REGEN -LRB- rain -RRB- is masculine -- or maybe it is feminine -- or possibly neuter -- it is too much trouble to look now .
Parsing [sent. 6813 len. 39]: Therefore , it is either DER -LRB- the -RRB- Regen , or DIE -LRB- the -RRB- Regen , or DAS -LRB- the -RRB- Regen , according to which gender it may turn out to be when I look .
Parsing [sent. 6814 len. 19]: In the interest of science , I will cipher it out on the hypothesis that it is masculine .
Parsing [sent. 6815 len. 95]: Very well -- then THE rain is DER Regen , if it is simply in the quiescent state of being MENTIONED , without enlargement or discussion -- Nominative case ; but if this rain is lying around , in a kind of a general way on the ground , it is then definitely located , it is DOING SOMETHING -- that is , RESTING -LRB- which is one of the German grammar 's ideas of doing something -RRB- , and this throws the rain into the Dative case , and makes it DEM Regen .
Parsing [sent. 6816 len. 52]: However , this rain is not resting , but is doing something ACTIVELY , -- it is falling -- to interfere with the bird , likely -- and this indicates MOVEMENT , which has the effect of sliding it into the Accusative case and changing DEM Regen into DEN Regen . ''
Parsing [sent. 6817 len. 37]: Having completed the grammatical horoscope of this matter , I answer up confidently and state in German that the bird is staying in the blacksmith shop `` wegen -LRB- on account of -RRB- DEN Regen . ''
Parsing [sent. 6818 len. 51]: Then the teacher lets me softly down with the remark that whenever the word `` wegen '' drops into a sentence , it ALWAYS throws that subject into the GENITIVE case , regardless of consequences -- and therefore this bird stayed in the blacksmith shop `` wegen DES Regens . ''
Parsing [sent. 6819 len. 49]: N.B. -- I was informed , later , by a higher authority , that there was an `` exception '' which permits one to say `` wegen DEN Regen '' in certain peculiar and complex circumstances , but that this exception is not extended to anything BUT rain .
Parsing [sent. 6820 len. 13]: There are ten parts of speech , and they are all troublesome .
Parsing [sent. 6821 len. 223]: An average sentence , in a German newspaper , is a sublime and impressive curiosity ; it occupies a quarter of a column ; it contains all the ten parts of speech -- not in regular order , but mixed ; it is built mainly of compound words constructed by the writer on the spot , and not to be found in any dictionary -- six or seven words compacted into one , without joint or seam -- that is , without hyphens ; it treats of fourteen or fifteen different subjects , each enclosed in a parenthesis of its own , with here and there extra parentheses , making pens within pens : finally , all the parentheses and reparentheses are massed together between a couple of king-parentheses , one of which is placed in the first line of the majestic sentence and the other in the middle of the last line of it -- AFTER WHICH COMES THE VERB , and you find out for the first time what the man has been talking about ; and after the verb -- merely by way of ornament , as far as I can make out -- the writer shovels in `` HABEN SIND GEWESEN GEHABT HAVEN GEWORDEN SEIN , '' or words to that effect , and the monument is finished .
Parsing [sent. 6822 len. 25]: I suppose that this closing hurrah is in the nature of the flourish to a man 's signature -- not necessary , but pretty .
Parsing [sent. 6823 len. 53]: German books are easy enough to read when you hold them before the looking-glass or stand on your head -- so as to reverse the construction -- but I think that to learn to read and understand a German newspaper is a thing which must always remain an impossibility to a foreigner .
Parsing [sent. 6824 len. 63]: Yet even the German books are not entirely free from attacks of the Parenthesis distemper -- though they are usually so mild as to cover only a few lines , and therefore when you at last get down to the verb it carries some meaning to your mind because you are able to remember a good deal of what has gone before .
Parsing [sent. 6825 len. 20]: Now here is a sentence from a popular and excellent German novel -- with a slight parenthesis in it .
Parsing [sent. 6826 len. 80]: I will make a perfectly literal translation , and throw in the parenthesis-marks and some hyphens for the assistance of the reader -- though in the original there are no parenthesis-marks or hyphens , and the reader is left to flounder through to the remote verb the best way he can : `` But when he , upon the street , the -LRB- in-satin-and-silk-covered-now-very-unconstrained-after-the-newest-fashioned-dressed -RRB- government counselor 's wife MET , '' etc. , etc. -LSB- 1 -RSB- 1 .
Parsing [sent. 6827 len. 23]: Wenn er aber auf der Strasse der in Sammt und Seide gehuellten jetz sehr ungenirt nach der neusten mode gekleideten Regierungsrathin begegnet .
Parsing [sent. 6828 len. 13]: That is from THE OLD MAMSELLE 'S SECRET , by Mrs. Marlitt .
Parsing [sent. 6829 len. 12]: And that sentence is constructed upon the most approved German model .
Parsing [sent. 6830 len. 71]: You observe how far that verb is from the reader 's base of operations ; well , in a German newspaper they put their verb away over on the next page ; and I have heard that sometimes after stringing along the exciting preliminaries and parentheses for a column or two , they get in a hurry and have to go to press without getting to the verb at all .
Parsing [sent. 6831 len. 17]: Of course , then , the reader is left in a very exhausted and ignorant state .
Parsing [sent. 6832 len. 78]: We have the Parenthesis disease in our literature , too ; and one may see cases of it every day in our books and newspapers : but with us it is the mark and sign of an unpracticed writer or a cloudy intellect , whereas with the Germans it is doubtless the mark and sign of a practiced pen and of the presence of that sort of luminous intellectual fog which stands for clearness among these people .
Parsing [sent. 6833 len. 14]: For surely it is NOT clearness -- it necessarily ca n't be clearness .
Parsing [sent. 6834 len. 11]: Even a jury would have penetration enough to discover that .
Parsing [sent. 6835 len. 70]: A writer 's ideas must be a good deal confused , a good deal out of line and sequence , when he starts out to say that a man met a counselor 's wife in the street , and then right in the midst of this so simple undertaking halts these approaching people and makes them stand still until he jots down an inventory of the woman 's dress .
Parsing [sent. 6836 len. 5]: That is manifestly absurd .
Parsing [sent. 6837 len. 44]: It reminds a person of those dentists who secure your instant and breathless interest in a tooth by taking a grip on it with the forceps , and then stand there and drawl through a tedious anecdote before they give the dreaded jerk .
Parsing [sent. 6838 len. 10]: Parentheses in literature and dentistry are in bad taste .
Parsing [sent. 6839 len. 39]: The Germans have another kind of parenthesis , which they make by splitting a verb in two and putting half of it at the beginning of an exciting chapter and the OTHER HALF at the end of it .
Parsing [sent. 6840 len. 11]: Can any one conceive of anything more confusing than that ?
Parsing [sent. 6841 len. 9]: These things are called `` separable verbs . ''
Parsing [sent. 6842 len. 38]: The German grammar is blistered all over with separable verbs ; and the wider the two portions of one of them are spread apart , the better the author of the crime is pleased with his performance .
Parsing [sent. 6843 len. 11]: A favorite one is REISTE AB -- which means departed .
Parsing [sent. 6844 len. 112]: Here is an example which I culled from a novel and reduced to English : `` The trunks being now ready , he DE - after kissing his mother and sisters , and once more pressing to his bosom his adored Gretchen , who , dressed in simple white muslin , with a single tuberose in the ample folds of her rich brown hair , had tottered feebly down the stairs , still pale from the terror and excitement of the past evening , but longing to lay her poor aching head yet once again upon the breast of him whom she loved more dearly than life itself , PARTED . ''
Parsing [sent. 6845 len. 15]: However , it is not well to dwell too much on the separable verbs .
Parsing [sent. 6846 len. 35]: One is sure to lose his temper early ; and if he sticks to the subject , and will not be warned , it will at last either soften his brain or petrify it .
Parsing [sent. 6847 len. 19]: Personal pronouns and adjectives are a fruitful nuisance in this language , and should have been left out .
Parsing [sent. 6848 len. 37]: For instance , the same sound , SIE , means YOU , and it means SHE , and it means HER , and it means IT , and it means THEY , and it means THEM .
Parsing [sent. 6849 len. 33]: Think of the ragged poverty of a language which has to make one word do the work of six -- and a poor little weak thing of only three letters at that .
Parsing [sent. 6850 len. 21]: But mainly , think of the exasperation of never knowing which of these meanings the speaker is trying to convey .
Parsing [sent. 6851 len. 23]: This explains why , whenever a person says SIE to me , I generally try to kill him , if a stranger .
Parsing [sent. 6852 len. 5]: Now observe the Adjective .
Parsing [sent. 6853 len. 30]: Here was a case where simplicity would have been an advantage ; therefore , for no other reason , the inventor of this language complicated it all he could .
Parsing [sent. 6854 len. 44]: When we wish to speak of our `` good friend or friends , '' in our enlightened tongue , we stick to the one form and have no trouble or hard feeling about it ; but with the German tongue it is different .
Parsing [sent. 6855 len. 30]: When a German gets his hands on an adjective , he declines it , and keeps on declining it until the common sense is all declined out of it .
Parsing [sent. 6856 len. 7]: It is as bad as Latin .
Parsing [sent. 6857 len. 17]: He says , for instance : SINGULAR Nominative -- Mein gutER Freund , my good friend .
Parsing [sent. 6858 len. 11]: Genitives -- MeinES GutEN FreundES , of my good friend .
Parsing [sent. 6859 len. 11]: Dative -- MeinEM gutEN Freund , to my good friend .
Parsing [sent. 6860 len. 10]: Accusative -- MeinEN gutEN Freund , my good friend .
Parsing [sent. 6861 len. 11]: PLURAL N. -- MeinE gutEN FreundE , my good friends .
Parsing [sent. 6862 len. 11]: G. -- MeinER gutEN FreundE , of my good friends .
Parsing [sent. 6863 len. 11]: D. -- MeinEN gutEN FreundEN , to my good friends .
Parsing [sent. 6864 len. 10]: A. -- MeinE gutEN FreundE , my good friends .
Parsing [sent. 6865 len. 22]: Now let the candidate for the asylum try to memorize those variations , and see how soon he will be elected .
Parsing [sent. 6866 len. 16]: One might better go without friends in Germany than take all this trouble about them .
Parsing [sent. 6867 len. 56]: I have shown what a bother it is to decline a good -LRB- male -RRB- friend ; well this is only a third of the work , for there is a variety of new distortions of the adjective to be learned when the object is feminine , and still another when the object is neuter .
Parsing [sent. 6868 len. 30]: Now there are more adjectives in this language than there are black cats in Switzerland , and they must all be as elaborately declined as the examples above suggested .
Parsing [sent. 6869 len. 2]: Difficult ?
Parsing [sent. 6870 len. 3]: -- troublesome ?
Parsing [sent. 6871 len. 8]: -- these words can not describe it .
Parsing [sent. 6872 len. 28]: I heard a Californian student in Heidelberg say , in one of his calmest moods , that he would rather decline two drinks than one German adjective .
Parsing [sent. 6873 len. 21]: The inventor of the language seems to have taken pleasure in complicating it in every way he could think of .
Parsing [sent. 6874 len. 64]: For instance , if one is casually referring to a house , HAUS , or a horse , PFERD , or a dog , HUND , he spells these words as I have indicated ; but if he is referring to them in the Dative case , he sticks on a foolish and unnecessary E and spells them HAUSE , PFERDE , HUNDE .
Parsing [sent. 6875 len. 121]: So , as an added E often signifies the plural , as the S does with us , the new student is likely to go on for a month making twins out of a Dative dog before he discovers his mistake ; and on the other hand , many a new student who could ill afford loss , has bought and paid for two dogs and only got one of them , because he ignorantly bought that dog in the Dative singular when he really supposed he was talking plural -- which left the law on the seller 's side , of course , by the strict rules of grammar , and therefore a suit for recovery could not lie .
Parsing [sent. 6876 len. 12]: In German , all the Nouns begin with a capital letter .
Parsing [sent. 6877 len. 23]: Now that is a good idea ; and a good idea , in this language , is necessarily conspicuous from its lonesomeness .
Parsing [sent. 6878 len. 30]: I consider this capitalizing of nouns a good idea , because by reason of it you are almost always able to tell a noun the minute you see it .
Parsing [sent. 6879 len. 37]: You fall into error occasionally , because you mistake the name of a person for the name of a thing , and waste a good deal of time trying to dig a meaning out of it .
Parsing [sent. 6880 len. 16]: German names almost always do mean something , and this helps to deceive the student .
Parsing [sent. 6881 len. 29]: I translated a passage one day , which said that `` the infuriated tigress broke loose and utterly ate up the unfortunate fir forest '' -LRB- Tannenwald -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 6882 len. 25]: When I was girding up my loins to doubt this , I found out that Tannenwald in this instance was a man 's name .
Parsing [sent. 6883 len. 30]: Every noun has a gender , and there is no sense or system in the distribution ; so the gender of each must be learned separately and by heart .
Parsing [sent. 6884 len. 6]: There is no other way .
Parsing [sent. 6885 len. 13]: To do this one has to have a memory like a memorandum-book .
Parsing [sent. 6886 len. 15]: In German , a young lady has no sex , while a turnip has .
Parsing [sent. 6887 len. 18]: Think what overwrought reverence that shows for the turnip , and what callous disrespect for the girl .
Parsing [sent. 6888 len. 27]: See how it looks in print -- I translate this from a conversation in one of the best of the German Sunday-school books : `` Gretchen .
Parsing [sent. 6889 len. 7]: Wilhelm , where is the turnip ?
Parsing [sent. 6890 len. 3]: `` Wilhelm .
Parsing [sent. 6891 len. 7]: She has gone to the kitchen .
Parsing [sent. 6892 len. 3]: `` Gretchen .
Parsing [sent. 6893 len. 9]: Where is the accomplished and beautiful English maiden ?
Parsing [sent. 6894 len. 3]: `` Wilhelm .
Parsing [sent. 6895 len. 8]: It has gone to the opera . ''
Parsing [sent. 6896 len. 154]: To continue with the German genders : a tree is male , its buds are female , its leaves are neuter ; horses are sexless , dogs are male , cats are female -- tomcats included , of course ; a person 's mouth , neck , bosom , elbows , fingers , nails , feet , and body are of the male sex , and his head is male or neuter according to the word selected to signify it , and NOT according to the sex of the individual who wears it -- for in Germany all the women wear either male heads or sexless ones ; a person 's nose , lips , shoulders , breast , hands , and toes are of the female sex ; and his hair , ears , eyes , chin , legs , knees , heart , and conscience have n't any sex at all .
Parsing [sent. 6897 len. 16]: The inventor of the language probably got what he knew about a conscience from hearsay .
Parsing [sent. 6898 len. 111]: Now , by the above dissection , the reader will see that in Germany a man may THINK he is a man , but when he comes to look into the matter closely , he is bound to have his doubts ; he finds that in sober truth he is a most ridiculous mixture ; and if he ends by trying to comfort himself with the thought that he can at least depend on a third of this mess as being manly and masculine , the humiliating second thought will quickly remind him that in this respect he is no better off than any woman or cow in the land .
Parsing [sent. 6899 len. 36]: In the German it is true that by some oversight of the inventor of the language , a Woman is a female ; but a Wife -LRB- Weib -RRB- is not -- which is unfortunate .
Parsing [sent. 6900 len. 36]: A Wife , here , has no sex ; she is neuter ; so , according to the grammar , a fish is HE , his scales are SHE , but a fishwife is neither .
Parsing [sent. 6901 len. 22]: To describe a wife as sexless may be called under-description ; that is bad enough , but over-description is surely worse .
Parsing [sent. 6902 len. 27]: A German speaks of an Englishman as the ENGLÄNNDER ; to change the sex , he adds INN , and that stands for Englishwoman -- ENGLÄNDERINN .
Parsing [sent. 6903 len. 53]: That seems descriptive enough , but still it is not exact enough for a German ; so he precedes the word with that article which indicates that the creature to follow is feminine , and writes it down thus : `` die Engländerinn , '' -- which means `` the she-Englishwoman . ''
Parsing [sent. 6904 len. 8]: I consider that that person is over-described .
Parsing [sent. 6905 len. 68]: Well , after the student has learned the sex of a great number of nouns , he is still in a difficulty , because he finds it impossible to persuade his tongue to refer to things as `` he '' and `` she , '' and `` him '' and `` her , '' which it has been always accustomed to refer to as `` it . ''
Parsing [sent. 6906 len. 61]: When he even frames a German sentence in his mind , with the hims and hers in the right places , and then works up his courage to the utterance-point , it is no use -- the moment he begins to speak his tongue flies the track and all those labored males and females come out as `` its . ''
Parsing [sent. 6907 len. 41]: And even when he is reading German to himself , he always calls those things `` it , '' whereas he ought to read in this way : TALE OF THE FISHWIFE AND ITS SAD FATE -LSB- 2 -RSB- 2 .
Parsing [sent. 6908 len. 15]: I capitalize the nouns , in the German -LRB- and ancient English -RRB- fashion .
Parsing [sent. 6909 len. 6]: It is a bleak Day .
Parsing [sent. 6910 len. 36]: Hear the Rain , how he pours , and the Hail , how he rattles ; and see the Snow , how he drifts along , and of the Mud , how deep he is !
Parsing [sent. 6911 len. 57]: Ah the poor Fishwife , it is stuck fast in the Mire ; it has dropped its Basket of Fishes ; and its Hands have been cut by the Scales as it seized some of the falling Creatures ; and one Scale has even got into its Eye , and it can not get her out .
Parsing [sent. 6912 len. 29]: It opens its Mouth to cry for Help ; but if any Sound comes out of him , alas he is drowned by the raging of the Storm .
Parsing [sent. 6913 len. 18]: And now a Tomcat has got one of the Fishes and she will surely escape with him .
Parsing [sent. 6914 len. 20]: No , she bites off a Fin , she holds her in her Mouth -- will she swallow her ?
Parsing [sent. 6915 len. 25]: No , the Fishwife 's brave Mother-dog deserts his Puppies and rescues the Fin -- which he eats , himself , as his Reward .
Parsing [sent. 6916 len. 159]: O , horror , the Lightning has struck the Fish-basket ; he sets him on Fire ; see the Flame , how she licks the doomed Utensil with her red and angry Tongue ; now she attacks the helpless Fishwife 's Foot -- she burns him up , all but the big Toe , and even SHE is partly consumed ; and still she spreads , still she waves her fiery Tongues ; she attacks the Fishwife 's Leg and destroys IT ; she attacks its Hand and destroys HER also ; she attacks the Fishwife 's Leg and destroys HER also ; she attacks its Body and consumes HIM ; she wreathes herself about its Heart and IT is consumed ; next about its Breast , and in a Moment SHE is a Cinder ; now she reaches its Neck -- He goes ; now its Chin -- IT goes ; now its Nose -- SHE goes .
Parsing [sent. 6917 len. 15]: In another Moment , except Help come , the Fishwife will be no more .
Parsing [sent. 6918 len. 11]: Time presses -- is there none to succor and save ?
Parsing [sent. 6919 len. 2]: Yes !
Parsing [sent. 6920 len. 11]: Joy , joy , with flying Feet the she-Englishwoman comes !
Parsing [sent. 6921 len. 17]: But alas , the generous she-Female is too late : where now is the fated Fishwife ?
Parsing [sent. 6922 len. 35]: It has ceased from its Sufferings , it has gone to a better Land ; all that is left of it for its loved Ones to lament over , is this poor smoldering Ash-heap .
Parsing [sent. 6923 len. 7]: Ah , woeful , woeful Ash-heap !
Parsing [sent. 6924 len. 68]: Let us take him up tenderly , reverently , upon the lowly Shovel , and bear him to his long Rest , with the Prayer that when he rises again it will be a Realm where he will have one good square responsible Sex , and have it all to himself , instead of having a mangy lot of assorted Sexes scattered all over him in Spots .
Parsing [sent. 6925 len. 24]: There , now , the reader can see for himself that this pronoun business is a very awkward thing for the unaccustomed tongue .
Parsing [sent. 6926 len. 30]: I suppose that in all languages the similarities of look and sound between words which have no similarity in meaning are a fruitful source of perplexity to the foreigner .
Parsing [sent. 6927 len. 17]: It is so in our tongue , and it is notably the case in the German .
Parsing [sent. 6928 len. 61]: Now there is that troublesome word VERMÄHLT : to me it has so close a resemblance -- either real or fancied -- to three or four other words , that I never know whether it means despised , painted , suspected , or married ; until I look in the dictionary , and then I find it means the latter .
Parsing [sent. 6929 len. 13]: There are lots of such words and they are a great torment .
Parsing [sent. 6930 len. 31]: To increase the difficulty there are words which SEEM to resemble each other , and yet do not ; but they make just as much trouble as if they did .
Parsing [sent. 6931 len. 32]: For instance , there is the word VERMIETHEN -LRB- to let , to lease , to hire -RRB- ; and the word VERHEIRATHEN -LRB- another way of saying to marry -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 6932 len. 32]: I heard of an Englishman who knocked at a man 's door in Heidelberg and proposed , in the best German he could command , to `` verheirathen '' that house .
Parsing [sent. 6933 len. 31]: Then there are some words which mean one thing when you emphasize the first syllable , but mean something very different if you throw the emphasis on the last syllable .
Parsing [sent. 6934 len. 70]: For instance , there is a word which means a runaway , or the act of glancing through a book , according to the placing of the emphasis ; and another word which signifies to ASSOCIATE with a man , or to AVOID him , according to where you put the emphasis -- and you can generally depend on putting it in the wrong place and getting into trouble .
Parsing [sent. 6935 len. 10]: There are some exceedingly useful words in this language .
Parsing [sent. 6936 len. 8]: SCHLAG , for example ; and ZUG .
Parsing [sent. 6937 len. 21]: There are three-quarters of a column of SCHLAGS in the dictonary , and a column and a half of ZUGS .
Parsing [sent. 6938 len. 44]: The word SCHLAG means Blow , Stroke , Dash , Hit , Shock , Clap , Slap , Time , Bar , Coin , Stamp , Kind , Sort , Manner , Way , Apoplexy , Wood-cutting , Enclosure , Field , Forest-clearing .
Parsing [sent. 6939 len. 53]: This is its simple and EXACT meaning -- that is to say , its restricted , its fettered meaning ; but there are ways by which you can set it free , so that it can soar away , as on the wings of the morning , and never be at rest .
Parsing [sent. 6940 len. 20]: You can hang any word you please to its tail , and make it mean anything you want to .
Parsing [sent. 6941 len. 42]: You can begin with SCHLAG-ADER , which means artery , and you can hang on the whole dictionary , word by word , clear through the alphabet to SCHLAG-WASSER , which means bilge-water -- and including SCHLAG-MUTTER , which means mother-in-law .
Parsing [sent. 6942 len. 6]: Just the same with ZUG .
Parsing [sent. 6943 len. 88]: Strictly speaking , ZUG means Pull , Tug , Draught , Procession , March , Progress , Flight , Direction , Expedition , Train , Caravan , Passage , Stroke , Touch , Line , Flourish , Trait of Character , Feature , Lineament , Chess-move , Organ-stop , Team , Whiff , Bias , Drawer , Propensity , Inhalation , Disposition : but that thing which it does NOT mean -- when all its legitimate pennants have been hung on , has not been discovered yet .
Parsing [sent. 6944 len. 11]: One can not overestimate the usefulness of SCHLAG and ZUG .
Parsing [sent. 6945 len. 21]: Armed just with these two , and the word ALSO , what can not the foreigner on German soil accomplish ?
Parsing [sent. 6946 len. 34]: The German word ALSO is the equivalent of the English phrase `` You know , '' and does not mean anything at all -- in TALK , though it sometimes does in print .
Parsing [sent. 6947 len. 30]: Every time a German opens his mouth an ALSO falls out ; and every time he shuts it he bites one in two that was trying to GET out .
Parsing [sent. 6948 len. 18]: Now , the foreigner , equipped with these three noble words , is master of the situation .
Parsing [sent. 6949 len. 87]: Let him talk right along , fearlessly ; let him pour his indifferent German forth , and when he lacks for a word , let him heave a SCHLAG into the vacuum ; all the chances are that it fits it like a plug , but if it does n't let him promptly heave a ZUG after it ; the two together can hardly fail to bung the hole ; but if , by a miracle , they SHOULD fail , let him simply say ALSO !
Parsing [sent. 6950 len. 16]: and this will give him a moment 's chance to think of the needful word .
Parsing [sent. 6951 len. 52]: In Germany , when you load your conversational gun it is always best to throw in a SCHLAG or two and a ZUG or two , because it does n't make any difference how much the rest of the charge may scatter , you are bound to bag something with THEM .
Parsing [sent. 6952 len. 11]: Then you blandly say ALSO , and load up again .
Parsing [sent. 6953 len. 34]: Nothing gives such an air of grace and elegance and unconstraint to a German or an English conversation as to scatter it full of `` Also 's '' or `` You knows . ''
Parsing [sent. 6954 len. 11]: In my note-book I find this entry : July 1 .
Parsing [sent. 6955 len. 51]: -- In the hospital yesterday , a word of thirteen syllables was successfully removed from a patient -- a North German from near Hamburg ; but as most unfortunately the surgeons had opened him in the wrong place , under the impression that he contained a panorama , he died .
Parsing [sent. 6956 len. 12]: The sad event has cast a gloom over the whole community .
Parsing [sent. 6957 len. 28]: That paragraph furnishes a text for a few remarks about one of the most curious and notable features of my subject -- the length of German words .
Parsing [sent. 6958 len. 12]: Some German words are so long that they have a perspective .
Parsing [sent. 6959 len. 6]: Observe these examples : Freundschaftsbezeigungen .
Parsing [sent. 6960 len. 2]: Dilettantenaufdringlichkeiten .
Parsing [sent. 6961 len. 2]: Stadtverordnetenversammlungen .
Parsing [sent. 6962 len. 11]: These things are not words , they are alphabetical processions .
Parsing [sent. 6963 len. 42]: And they are not rare ; one can open a German newspaper at any time and see them marching majestically across the page -- and if he has any imagination he can see the banners and hear the music , too .
Parsing [sent. 6964 len. 10]: They impart a martial thrill to the meekest subject .
Parsing [sent. 6965 len. 9]: I take a great interest in these curiosities .
Parsing [sent. 6966 len. 18]: Whenever I come across a good one , I stuff it and put it in my museum .
Parsing [sent. 6967 len. 11]: In this way I have made quite a valuable collection .
Parsing [sent. 6968 len. 20]: When I get duplicates , I exchange with other collectors , and thus increase the variety of my stock .
Parsing [sent. 6969 len. 23]: Here are some specimens which I lately bought at an auction sale of the effects of a bankrupt bric-a-brac hunter : Generalstaatsverordnetenversammlungen .
Parsing [sent. 6970 len. 2]: Alterthumswissenschaften .
Parsing [sent. 6971 len. 2]: Kinderbewahrungsanstalten .
Parsing [sent. 6972 len. 2]: Unabhängigkeitserklärungen .
Parsing [sent. 6973 len. 2]: Wiedererstellungbestrebungen .
Parsing [sent. 6974 len. 2]: Waffenstillstandsunterhandlungen .
Parsing [sent. 6975 len. 63]: Of course when one of these grand mountain ranges goes stretching across the printed page , it adorns and ennobles that literary landscape -- but at the same time it is a great distress to the new student , for it blocks up his way ; he can not crawl under it , or climb over it , or tunnel through it .
Parsing [sent. 6976 len. 16]: So he resorts to the dictionary for help , but there is no help there .
Parsing [sent. 6977 len. 17]: The dictionary must draw the line somewhere -- so it leaves this sort of words out .
Parsing [sent. 6978 len. 32]: And it is right , because these long things are hardly legitimate words , but are rather combinations of words , and the inventor of them ought to have been killed .
Parsing [sent. 6979 len. 10]: They are compound words with the hyphens left out .
Parsing [sent. 6980 len. 48]: The various words used in building them are in the dictionary , but in a very scattered condition ; so you can hunt the materials out , one by one , and get at the meaning at last , but it is a tedious and harassing business .
Parsing [sent. 6981 len. 12]: I have tried this process upon some of the above examples .
Parsing [sent. 6982 len. 27]: `` Freundshaftsbezeigungen '' seems to be `` Friendship demonstrations , '' which is only a foolish and clumsy way of saying `` demonstrations of friendship . ''
Parsing [sent. 6983 len. 28]: `` Unabhängigkeitserklärungen '' seems to be `` Independencedeclarations , '' which is no improvement upon `` Declarations of Independence , '' so far as I can see .
Parsing [sent. 6984 len. 36]: `` Generalstaatsverordnetenversammlungen '' seems to be `` General-statesrepresentativesmeetings , '' as nearly as I can get at it -- a mere rhythmical , gushy euphemism for `` meetings of the legislature , '' I judge .
Parsing [sent. 6985 len. 23]: We used to have a good deal of this sort of crime in our literature , but it has gone out now .
Parsing [sent. 6986 len. 40]: We used to speak of a thing as a `` never-to-be-forgotten '' circumstance , instead of cramping it into the simple and sufficient word `` memorable '' and then going calmly about our business as if nothing had happened .
Parsing [sent. 6987 len. 25]: In those days we were not content to embalm the thing and bury it decently , we wanted to build a monument over it .
Parsing [sent. 6988 len. 26]: But in our newspapers the compounding-disease lingers a little to the present day , but with the hyphens left out , in the German fashion .
Parsing [sent. 6989 len. 50]: This is the shape it takes : instead of saying `` Mr. Simmons , clerk of the county and district courts , was in town yesterday , '' the new form puts it thus : `` Clerk of the County and District Courts Simmons was in town yesterday . ''
Parsing [sent. 6990 len. 14]: This saves neither time nor ink , and has an awkward sound besides .
Parsing [sent. 6991 len. 28]: One often sees a remark like this in our papers : `` MRS. Assistant District Attorney Johnson returned to her city residence yesterday for the season . ''
Parsing [sent. 6992 len. 33]: That is a case of really unjustifiable compounding ; because it not only saves no time or trouble , but confers a title on Mrs. Johnson which she has no right to .
Parsing [sent. 6993 len. 22]: But these little instances are trifles indeed , contrasted with the ponderous and dismal German system of piling jumbled compounds together .
Parsing [sent. 6994 len. 37]: I wish to submit the following local item , from a Mannheim journal , by way of illustration : `` In the daybeforeyesterdayshortlyaftereleveno ` clock Night , the inthistownstandingtavern called ` The Wagoner ' was downburnt .
Parsing [sent. 6995 len. 17]: When the fire to the onthedownburninghouseresting Stork 's Nest reached , flew the parent Storks away .
Parsing [sent. 6996 len. 31]: But when the bytheraging , firesurrounded Nest ITSELF caught Fire , straightway plunged the quickreturning Mother-Stork into the Flames and died , her Wings over her young ones outspread . ''
Parsing [sent. 6997 len. 26]: Even the cumbersome German construction is not able to take the pathos out of that picture -- indeed , it somehow seems to strengthen it .
Parsing [sent. 6998 len. 10]: This item is dated away back yonder months ago .
Parsing [sent. 6999 len. 17]: I could have used it sooner , but I was waiting to hear from the Father-stork .
Parsing [sent. 7000 len. 5]: I am still waiting .
Parsing [sent. 7001 len. 4]: `` ALSO ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7002 len. 22]: If I had not shown that the German is a difficult language , I have at least intended to do so .
Parsing [sent. 7003 len. 33]: I have heard of an American student who was asked how he was getting along with his German , and who answered promptly : `` I am not getting along at all .
Parsing [sent. 7004 len. 38]: I have worked at it hard for three level months , and all I have got to show for it is one solitary German phrase -- ` ZWEI GLAS ' '' -LRB- two glasses of beer -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 7005 len. 22]: He paused for a moment , reflectively ; then added with feeling : `` But I 've got that SOLID ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7006 len. 28]: And if I have not also shown that German is a harassing and infuriating study , my execution has been at fault , and not my intent .
Parsing [sent. 7007 len. 52]: I heard lately of a worn and sorely tried American student who used to fly to a certain German word for relief when he could bear up under his aggravations no longer -- the only word whose sound was sweet and precious to his ear and healing to his lacerated spirit .
Parsing [sent. 7008 len. 6]: This was the word DAMIT .
Parsing [sent. 7009 len. 50]: It was only the SOUND that helped him , not the meaning ; -LSB- 3 -RSB- and so , at last , when he learned that the emphasis was not on the first syllable , his only stay and support was gone , and he faded away and died .
Parsing [sent. 7010 len. 2]: 3 .
Parsing [sent. 7011 len. 13]: It merely means , in its general sense , `` herewith . ''
Parsing [sent. 7012 len. 22]: I think that a description of any loud , stirring , tumultuous episode must be tamer in German than in English .
Parsing [sent. 7013 len. 29]: Our descriptive words of this character have such a deep , strong , resonant sound , while their German equivalents do seem so thin and mild and energyless .
Parsing [sent. 7014 len. 32]: Boom , burst , crash , roar , storm , bellow , blow , thunder , explosion ; howl , cry , shout , yell , groan ; battle , hell .
Parsing [sent. 7015 len. 20]: These are magnificent words ; the have a force and magnitude of sound befitting the things which they describe .
Parsing [sent. 7016 len. 35]: But their German equivalents would be ever so nice to sing the children to sleep with , or else my awe-inspiring ears were made for display and not for superior usefulness in analyzing sounds .
Parsing [sent. 7017 len. 21]: Would any man want to die in a battle which was called by so tame a term as a SCHLACHT ?
Parsing [sent. 7018 len. 38]: Or would not a comsumptive feel too much bundled up , who was about to go out , in a shirt-collar and a seal-ring , into a storm which the bird-song word GEWITTER was employed to describe ?
Parsing [sent. 7019 len. 14]: And observe the strongest of the several German equivalents for explosion -- AUSBRUCH .
Parsing [sent. 7020 len. 9]: Our word Toothbrush is more powerful than that .
Parsing [sent. 7021 len. 23]: It seems to me that the Germans could do worse than import it into their language to describe particularly tremendous explosions with .
Parsing [sent. 7022 len. 29]: The German word for hell -- Hoelle -- sounds more like HELLY than anything else ; therefore , how necessarily chipper , frivolous , and unimpressive it is .
Parsing [sent. 7023 len. 22]: If a man were told in German to go there , could he really rise to thee dignity of feeling insulted ?
Parsing [sent. 7024 len. 29]: Having pointed out , in detail , the several vices of this language , I now come to the brief and pleasant task of pointing out its virtues .
Parsing [sent. 7025 len. 10]: The capitalizing of the nouns I have already mentioned .
Parsing [sent. 7026 len. 20]: But far before this virtue stands another -- that of spelling a word according to the sound of it .
Parsing [sent. 7027 len. 47]: After one short lesson in the alphabet , the student can tell how any German word is pronounced without having to ask ; whereas in our language if a student should inquire of us , `` What does B , O , W , spell ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7028 len. 65]: we should be obliged to reply , `` Nobody can tell what it spells when you set if off by itself ; you can only tell by referring to the context and finding out what it signifies -- whether it is a thing to shoot arrows with , or a nod of one 's head , or the forward end of a boat . ''
Parsing [sent. 7029 len. 12]: There are some German words which are singularly and powerfully effective .
Parsing [sent. 7030 len. 136]: For instance , those which describe lowly , peaceful , and affectionate home life ; those which deal with love , in any and all forms , from mere kindly feeling and honest good will toward the passing stranger , clear up to courtship ; those which deal with outdoor Nature , in its softest and loveliest aspects -- with meadows and forests , and birds and flowers , the fragrance and sunshine of summer , and the moonlight of peaceful winter nights ; in a word , those which deal with any and all forms of rest , repose , and peace ; those also which deal with the creatures and marvels of fairyland ; and lastly and chiefly , in those words which express pathos , is the language surpassingly rich and affective .
Parsing [sent. 7031 len. 14]: There are German songs which can make a stranger to the language cry .
Parsing [sent. 7032 len. 36]: That shows that the SOUND of the words is correct -- it interprets the meanings with truth and with exactness ; and so the ear is informed , and through the ear , the heart .
Parsing [sent. 7033 len. 19]: The Germans do not seem to be afraid to repeat a word when it is the right one .
Parsing [sent. 7034 len. 10]: They repeat it several times , if they choose .
Parsing [sent. 7035 len. 4]: That is wise .
Parsing [sent. 7036 len. 54]: But in English , when we have used a word a couple of times in a paragraph , we imagine we are growing tautological , and so we are weak enough to exchange it for some other word which only approximates exactness , to escape what we wrongly fancy is a greater blemish .
Parsing [sent. 7037 len. 11]: Repetition may be bad , but surely inexactness is worse .
Parsing [sent. 7038 len. 38]: There are people in the world who will take a great deal of trouble to point out the faults in a religion or a language , and then go blandly about their business without suggesting any remedy .
Parsing [sent. 7039 len. 8]: I am not that kind of person .
Parsing [sent. 7040 len. 10]: I have shown that the German language needs reforming .
Parsing [sent. 7041 len. 10]: Very well , I am ready to reform it .
Parsing [sent. 7042 len. 11]: At least I am ready to make the proper suggestions .
Parsing [sent. 7043 len. 58]: Such a course as this might be immodest in another ; but I have devoted upward of nine full weeks , first and last , to a careful and critical study of this tongue , and thus have acquired a confidence in my ability to reform it which no mere superficial culture could have conferred upon me .
Parsing [sent. 7044 len. 13]: In the first place , I would leave out the Dative case .
Parsing [sent. 7045 len. 66]: It confuses the plurals ; and , besides , nobody ever knows when he is in the Dative case , except he discover it by accident -- and then he does not know when or where it was that he got into it , or how long he has been in it , or how he is ever going to get out of it again .
Parsing [sent. 7046 len. 16]: The Dative case is but an ornamental folly -- it is better to discard it .
Parsing [sent. 7047 len. 16]: In the next place , I would move the Verb further up to the front .
Parsing [sent. 7048 len. 35]: You may load up with ever so good a Verb , but I notice that you never really bring down a subject with it at the present German range -- you only cripple it .
Parsing [sent. 7049 len. 27]: So I insist that this important part of speech should be brought forward to a position where it may be easily seen with the naked eye .
Parsing [sent. 7050 len. 33]: Thirdly , I would import some strong words from the English tongue -- to swear with , and also to use in describing all sorts of vigorous things in a vigorous way .
Parsing [sent. 7051 len. 5]: -LSB- 4 -RSB- 1 .
Parsing [sent. 7052 len. 35]: `` Verdammt , '' and its variations and enlargements , are words which have plenty of meaning , but the SOUNDS are so mild and ineffectual that German ladies can use them without sin .
Parsing [sent. 7053 len. 38]: German ladies who could not be induced to commit a sin by any persuasion or compulsion , promptly rip out one of these harmless little words when they tear their dresses or do n't like the soup .
Parsing [sent. 7054 len. 12]: It sounds about as wicked as our `` My gracious . ''
Parsing [sent. 7055 len. 9]: German ladies are constantly saying , `` Ach !
Parsing [sent. 7056 len. 3]: Gott ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7057 len. 5]: `` Mein Gott ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7058 len. 6]: `` Gott in Himmel ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7059 len. 10]: `` Herr Gott '' `` Der Herr Jesus ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7060 len. 2]: etc. .
Parsing [sent. 7061 len. 48]: They think our ladies have the same custom , perhaps ; for I once heard a gentle and lovely old German lady say to a sweet young American girl : `` The two languages are so alike -- how pleasant that is ; we say ` Ach !
Parsing [sent. 7062 len. 3]: Gott ! '
Parsing [sent. 7063 len. 7]: you say ` Goddamn . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 7064 len. 19]: Fourthly , I would reorganizes the sexes , and distribute them accordingly to the will of the creator .
Parsing [sent. 7065 len. 11]: This as a tribute of respect , if nothing else .
Parsing [sent. 7066 len. 28]: Fifthly , I would do away with those great long compounded words ; or require the speaker to deliver them in sections , with intermissions for refreshments .
Parsing [sent. 7067 len. 32]: To wholly do away with them would be best , for ideas are more easily received and digested when they come one at a time than when they come in bulk .
Parsing [sent. 7068 len. 24]: Intellectual food is like any other ; it is pleasanter and more beneficial to take it with a spoon than with a shovel .
Parsing [sent. 7069 len. 38]: Sixthly , I would require a speaker to stop when he is done , and not hang a string of those useless `` haven sind gewesen gehabt haben geworden seins '' to the end of his oration .
Parsing [sent. 7070 len. 14]: This sort of gewgaws undignify a speech , instead of adding a grace .
Parsing [sent. 7071 len. 13]: They are , therefore , an offense , and should be discarded .
Parsing [sent. 7072 len. 8]: Seventhly , I would discard the Parenthesis .
Parsing [sent. 7073 len. 19]: Also the reparenthesis , the re-reparenthesis , and the re-re-re-re-re-reparentheses , and likewise the final wide-reaching all-enclosing king-parenthesis .
Parsing [sent. 7074 len. 32]: I would require every individual , be he high or low , to unfold a plain straightforward tale , or else coil it and sit on it and hold his peace .
Parsing [sent. 7075 len. 10]: Infractions of this law should be punishable with death .
Parsing [sent. 7076 len. 25]: And eighthly , and last , I would retain ZUG and SCHLAG , with their pendants , and discard the rest of the vocabulary .
Parsing [sent. 7077 len. 6]: This would simplify the language .
Parsing [sent. 7078 len. 15]: I have now named what I regard as the most necessary and important changes .
Parsing [sent. 7079 len. 47]: These are perhaps all I could be expected to name for nothing ; but there are other suggestions which I can and will make in case my proposed application shall result in my being formally employed by the government in the work of reforming the language .
Parsing [sent. 7080 len. 35]: My philological studies have satisfied me that a gifted person ought to learn English -LRB- barring spelling and pronouncing -RRB- in thirty hours , French in thirty days , and German in thirty years .
Parsing [sent. 7081 len. 18]: It seems manifest , then , that the latter tongue ought to be trimmed down and repaired .
Parsing [sent. 7082 len. 33]: If it is to remain as it is , it ought to be gently and reverently set aside among the dead languages , for only the dead have time to learn it .
Parsing [sent. 7083 len. 95]: A FOURTH OF JULY ORATION IN THE GERMAN TONGUE , DELIVERED AT A BANQUET OF THE ANGLO-AMERICAN CLUB OF STUDENTS BY THE AUTHOR OF THIS BOOK Gentlemen : Since I arrived , a month ago , in this old wonderland , this vast garden of Germany , my English tongue has so often proved a useless piece of baggage to me , and so troublesome to carry around , in a country where they have n't the checking system for luggage , that I finally set to work , and learned the German language .
Parsing [sent. 7084 len. 2]: Also !
Parsing [sent. 7085 len. 42]: Es freut mich dass dies so ist , denn es muss , in ein hauptsächlich degree , höflich sein , dass man auf ein occasion like this , sein Rede in die Sprache des Landes worin he boards , aussprechen soll .
Parsing [sent. 7086 len. 37]: Dafuer habe ich , aus reinische Verlegenheit -- no , Vergangenheit -- no , I mean Höflichkeit -- aus reinishe Höflichkeit habe ich resolved to tackle this business in the German language , um Gottes willen !
Parsing [sent. 7087 len. 2]: Also !
Parsing [sent. 7088 len. 60]: Sie muessen so freundlich sein , und verzeih mich die interlarding von ein oder zwei Englischer Worte , hie und da , denn ich finde dass die deutsche is not a very copious language , and so when you 've really got anything to say , you 've got to draw on a language that can stand the strain .
Parsing [sent. 7089 len. 29]: Wenn haber man kann nicht meinem Rede Verstehen , so werde ich ihm später dasselbe uebersetz , wenn er solche Dienst verlangen wollen haben werden sollen sein hätte .
Parsing [sent. 7090 len. 39]: -LRB- I do n't know what wollen haben werden sollen sein hätte means , but I notice they always put it at the end of a German sentence -- merely for general literary gorgeousness , I suppose . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 7091 len. 80]: This is a great and justly honored day -- a day which is worthy of the veneration in which it is held by the true patriots of all climes and nationalities -- a day which offers a fruitful theme for thought and speech ; und meinem Freunde -- no , meinEN FreundEN -- meinES FreundES -- well , take your choice , they 're all the same price ; I do n't know which one is right -- also !
Parsing [sent. 7092 len. 33]: ich habe gehabt haben worden gewesen sein , as Goethe says in his Paradise Lost -- ich -- ich -- that is to say -- ich -- but let us change cars .
Parsing [sent. 7093 len. 2]: Also !
Parsing [sent. 7094 len. 21]: Die Anblich so viele Grossbrittanischer und Amerikanischer hier zusammengetroffen in Bruderliche concord , ist zwar a welcome and inspiriting spectacle .
Parsing [sent. 7095 len. 8]: And what has moved you to it ?
Parsing [sent. 7096 len. 13]: Can the terse German tongue rise to the expression of this impulse ?
Parsing [sent. 7097 len. 4]: Is it Freundschaftsbezeigungenstadtverordnetenversammlungenfamilieneigenthümlichkeiten ?
Parsing [sent. 7098 len. 5]: Nein , O nein !
Parsing [sent. 7099 len. 67]: This is a crisp and noble word , but it fails to pierce the marrow of the impulse which has gathered this friendly meeting and produced diese Anblick -- eine Anblich welche ist gut zu sehen -- gut fuer die Augen in a foreign land and a far country -- eine Anblick solche als in die gewöhnliche Heidelberger phrase nennt man ein `` schönes Aussicht ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7100 len. 7]: Ja , freilich natürlich wahrscheinlich ebensowohl !
Parsing [sent. 7101 len. 2]: Also !
Parsing [sent. 7102 len. 20]: Die Aussicht auf dem Koenigsstuhl mehr grösser ist , aber geistlische sprechend nicht so schön , lob ' Gott !
Parsing [sent. 7103 len. 47]: Because sie sind hier zusammengetroffen , in Bruderlichem concord , ein grossen Tag zu feirn , whose high benefits were not for one land and one locality , but have conferred a measure of good upon all lands that know liberty today , and love it .
Parsing [sent. 7104 len. 23]: Hundert Jahre vorueber , waren die Engländer und die Amerikaner Feinde ; aber heut sind sie herzlichen Freunde , Gott sei Dank !
Parsing [sent. 7105 len. 72]: May this good-fellowship endure ; may these banners here blended in amity so remain ; may they never any more wave over opposing hosts , or be stained with blood which was kindred , is kindred , and always will be kindred , until a line drawn upon a map shall be able to say : `` THIS bars the ancestral blood from flowing in the veins of the descendant ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7106 len. 62]: APPENDIX E. Legend of the Castles Called the `` Swallow 's Nest '' and `` The Brothers , '' as Condensed from the Captain 's Tale In the neighborhood of three hundred years ago the Swallow 's Nest and the larger castle between it and Neckarsteinach were owned and occupied by two old knights who were twin brothers , and bachelors .
Parsing [sent. 7107 len. 5]: They had no relatives .
Parsing [sent. 7108 len. 5]: They were very rich .
Parsing [sent. 7109 len. 17]: They had fought through the wars and retired to private life -- covered with honorable scars .
Parsing [sent. 7110 len. 31]: They were honest , honorable men in their dealings , but the people had given them a couple of nicknames which were very suggestive -- Herr Givenaught and Herr Heartless .
Parsing [sent. 7111 len. 24]: The old knights were so proud of these names that if a burgher called them by their right ones they would correct them .
Parsing [sent. 7112 len. 23]: The most renowned scholar in Europe , at the time , was the Herr Doctor Franz Reikmann , who lived in Heidelberg .
Parsing [sent. 7113 len. 23]: All Germany was proud of the venerable scholar , who lived in the simplest way , for great scholars are always poor .
Parsing [sent. 7114 len. 21]: He was poor , as to money , but very rich in his sweet young daughter Hildegarde and his library .
Parsing [sent. 7115 len. 26]: He had been all his life collecting his library , book and book , and he lived it as a miser loves his hoarded gold .
Parsing [sent. 7116 len. 33]: He said the two strings of his heart were rooted , the one in his daughter , the other in his books ; and that if either were severed he must die .
Parsing [sent. 7117 len. 36]: Now in an evil hour , hoping to win a marriage portion for his child , this simple old man had intrusted his small savings to a sharper to be ventured in a glittering speculation .
Parsing [sent. 7118 len. 18]: But that was not the worst of it : he signed a paper -- without reading it .
Parsing [sent. 7119 len. 15]: That is the way with poets and scholars ; they always sign without reading .
Parsing [sent. 7120 len. 11]: This cunning paper made him responsible for heaps of things .
Parsing [sent. 7121 len. 20]: The rest was that one night he found himself in debt to the sharper eight thousand pieces of gold !
Parsing [sent. 7122 len. 15]: -- an amount so prodigious that it simply stupefied him to think of it .
Parsing [sent. 7123 len. 10]: It was a night of woe in that house .
Parsing [sent. 7124 len. 13]: `` I must part with my library -- I have nothing else .
Parsing [sent. 7125 len. 11]: So perishes one heartstring , '' said the old man .
Parsing [sent. 7126 len. 9]: `` What will it bring , father ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7127 len. 4]: asked the girl .
Parsing [sent. 7128 len. 3]: `` Nothing !
Parsing [sent. 7129 len. 21]: It is worth seven hundred pieces of gold ; but by auction it will go for little or nothing . ''
Parsing [sent. 7130 len. 34]: `` Then you will have parted with the half of your heart and the joy of your life to no purpose , since so mighty a burden of debt will remain behind . ''
Parsing [sent. 7131 len. 11]: `` There is no help for it , my child .
Parsing [sent. 7132 len. 8]: Our darlings must pass under the hammer .
Parsing [sent. 7133 len. 8]: We must pay what we can . ''
Parsing [sent. 7134 len. 18]: `` My father , I have a feeling that the dear Virgin will come to our help .
Parsing [sent. 7135 len. 7]: Let us not lose heart . ''
Parsing [sent. 7136 len. 27]: `` She can not devise a miracle that will turn NOTHING into eight thousand gold pieces , and lesser help will bring us little peace . ''
Parsing [sent. 7137 len. 11]: `` She can do even greater things , my father .
Parsing [sent. 7138 len. 11]: She will save us , I know she will . ''
Parsing [sent. 7139 len. 66]: Toward morning , while the old man sat exhausted and asleep in his chair where he had been sitting before his books as one who watches by his beloved dead and prints the features on his memory for a solace in the aftertime of empty desolation , his daughter sprang into the room and gently woke him , saying -- `` My presentiment was true !
Parsing [sent. 7140 len. 5]: She will save us .
Parsing [sent. 7141 len. 35]: Three times has she appeared to me in my dreams , and said , ` Go to the Herr Givenaught , go to the Herr Heartless , ask them to come and bid . '
Parsing [sent. 7142 len. 18]: There , did I not tell you she would save us , the thrice blessed Virgin ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7143 len. 13]: Sad as the old man was , he was obliged to laugh .
Parsing [sent. 7144 len. 29]: `` Thou mightest as well appeal to the rocks their castles stand upon as to the harder ones that lie in those men 's breasts , my child .
Parsing [sent. 7145 len. 10]: THEY bid on books writ in the learned tongues !
Parsing [sent. 7146 len. 9]: -- they can scarce read their own . ''
Parsing [sent. 7147 len. 10]: But Hildegarde 's faith was in no wise shaken .
Parsing [sent. 7148 len. 19]: Bright and early she was on her way up the Neckar road , as joyous as a bird .
Parsing [sent. 7149 len. 74]: Meantime Herr Givenaught and Herr Heartless were having an early breakfast in the former 's castle -- the Sparrow 's Nest -- and flavoring it with a quarrel ; for although these twins bore a love for each other which almost amounted to worship , there was one subject upon which they could not touch without calling each other hard names -- and yet it was the subject which they oftenest touched upon .
Parsing [sent. 7150 len. 32]: `` I tell you , '' said Givenaught , `` you will beggar yourself yet with your insane squanderings of money upon what you choose to consider poor and worthy objects .
Parsing [sent. 7151 len. 22]: All these years I have implored you to stop this foolish custom and husband your means , but all in vain .
Parsing [sent. 7152 len. 21]: You are always lying to me about these secret benevolences , but you never have managed to deceive me yet .
Parsing [sent. 7153 len. 23]: Every time a poor devil has been set upon his feet I have detected your hand in it -- incorrigible ass ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7154 len. 16]: `` Every time you did n't set him on his feet yourself , you mean .
Parsing [sent. 7155 len. 18]: Where I give one unfortunate a little private lift , you do the same for a dozen .
Parsing [sent. 7156 len. 20]: The idea of YOUR swelling around the country and petting yourself with the nickname of Givenaught -- intolerable humbug !
Parsing [sent. 7157 len. 18]: Before I would be such a fraud as that , I would cut my right hand off .
Parsing [sent. 7158 len. 7]: Your life is a continual lie .
Parsing [sent. 7159 len. 33]: But go on , I have tried MY best to save you from beggaring yourself by your riotous charities -- now for the thousandth time I wash my hands of the consequences .
Parsing [sent. 7160 len. 5]: A maundering old fool !
Parsing [sent. 7161 len. 7]: that 's what you are . ''
Parsing [sent. 7162 len. 9]: `` And you a blethering old idiot ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7163 len. 6]: roared Givenaught , springing up .
Parsing [sent. 7164 len. 23]: `` I wo n't stay in the presence of a man who has no more delicacy than to call me such names .
Parsing [sent. 7165 len. 4]: Mannerless swine ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7166 len. 11]: So saying , Herr Heartless sprang up in a passion .
Parsing [sent. 7167 len. 26]: But some lucky accident intervened , as usual , to change the subject , and the daily quarrel ended in the customary daily living reconciliation .
Parsing [sent. 7168 len. 16]: The gray-headed old eccentrics parted , and Herr Heartless walked off to his own castle .
Parsing [sent. 7169 len. 15]: Half an hour later , Hildegarde was standing in the presence of Herr Givenaught .
Parsing [sent. 7170 len. 38]: He heard her story , and said -- `` I am sorry for you , my child , but I am very poor , I care nothing for bookish rubbish , I shall not be there . ''
Parsing [sent. 7171 len. 18]: He said the hard words kindly , but they nearly broke poor Hildegarde 's heart , nevertheless .
Parsing [sent. 7172 len. 20]: When she was gone the old heartbreaker muttered , rubbing his hands -- `` It was a good stroke .
Parsing [sent. 7173 len. 15]: I have saved my brother 's pocket this time , in spite of him .
Parsing [sent. 7174 len. 23]: Nothing else would have prevented his rushing off to rescue the old scholar , the pride of Germany , from his trouble .
Parsing [sent. 7175 len. 21]: The poor child wo n't venture near HIM after the rebuff she has received from his brother the Givenaught . ''
Parsing [sent. 7176 len. 5]: But he was mistaken .
Parsing [sent. 7177 len. 10]: The Virgin had commanded , and Hildegarde would obey .
Parsing [sent. 7178 len. 10]: She went to Herr Heartless and told her story .
Parsing [sent. 7179 len. 21]: But he said coldly -- `` I am very poor , my child , and books are nothing to me .
Parsing [sent. 7180 len. 12]: I wish you well , but I shall not come . ''
Parsing [sent. 7181 len. 32]: When Hildegarde was gone , he chuckled and said -- `` How my fool of a soft-headed soft-hearted brother would rage if he knew how cunningly I have saved his pocket .
Parsing [sent. 7182 len. 12]: How he would have flown to the old man 's rescue !
Parsing [sent. 7183 len. 11]: But the girl wo n't venture near him now . ''
Parsing [sent. 7184 len. 14]: When Hildegarde reached home , her father asked her how she had prospered .
Parsing [sent. 7185 len. 24]: She said -- `` The Virgin has promised , and she will keep her word ; but not in the way I thought .
Parsing [sent. 7186 len. 12]: She knows her own ways , and they are best . ''
Parsing [sent. 7187 len. 26]: The old man patted her on the head , and smiled a doubting smile , but he honored her for her brave faith , nevertheless .
Parsing [sent. 7188 len. 42]: II Next day the people assembled in the great hall of the Ritter tavern , to witness the auction -- for the proprietor had said the treasure of Germany 's most honored son should be bartered away in no meaner place .
Parsing [sent. 7189 len. 21]: Hildegarde and her father sat close to the books , silent and sorrowful , and holding each other 's hands .
Parsing [sent. 7190 len. 9]: There was a great crowd of people present .
Parsing [sent. 7191 len. 21]: The bidding began -- `` How much for this precious library , just as it stands , all complete ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7192 len. 4]: called the auctioneer .
Parsing [sent. 7193 len. 7]: `` Fifty pieces of gold ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7194 len. 5]: `` A hundred ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7195 len. 5]: `` Two hundred . ''
Parsing [sent. 7196 len. 4]: `` Three ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7197 len. 4]: `` Four ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7198 len. 5]: `` Five hundred ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7199 len. 5]: `` Five twenty-five . ''
Parsing [sent. 7200 len. 4]: A brief pause .
Parsing [sent. 7201 len. 5]: `` Five forty ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7202 len. 11]: A longer pause , while the auctioneer redoubled his persuasions .
Parsing [sent. 7203 len. 4]: `` Five-forty-five ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7204 len. 41]: A heavy drag -- the auctioneer persuaded , pleaded , implored -- it was useless , everybody remained silent -- `` Well , then -- going , going -- one -- two -- '' `` Five hundred and fifty ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7205 len. 27]: This in a shrill voice , from a bent old man , all hung with rags , and with a green patch over his left eye .
Parsing [sent. 7206 len. 10]: Everybody in his vicinity turned and gazed at him .
Parsing [sent. 7207 len. 6]: It was Givenaught in disguise .
Parsing [sent. 7208 len. 9]: He was using a disguised voice , too .
Parsing [sent. 7209 len. 4]: `` Good ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7210 len. 4]: cried the auctioneer .
Parsing [sent. 7211 len. 17]: `` Going , going -- one -- two -- '' `` Five hundred and sixty ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7212 len. 23]: This , in a deep , harsh voice , from the midst of the crowd at the other end of the room .
Parsing [sent. 7213 len. 22]: The people near by turned , and saw an old man , in a strange costume , supporting himself on crutches .
Parsing [sent. 7214 len. 11]: He wore a long white beard , and blue spectacles .
Parsing [sent. 7215 len. 14]: It was Herr Heartless , in disguise , and using a disguised voice .
Parsing [sent. 7216 len. 4]: `` Good again !
Parsing [sent. 7217 len. 12]: Going , going -- one -- '' `` Six hundred ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7218 len. 2]: Sensation .
Parsing [sent. 7219 len. 19]: The crowd raised a cheer , and some one cried out , `` Go it , Green-patch ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7220 len. 18]: This tickled the audience and a score of voices shouted , `` Go it , Green-patch ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7221 len. 22]: `` Going -- going -- going -- third and last call -- one -- two -- '' `` Seven hundred ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7222 len. 3]: `` Huzzah !
Parsing [sent. 7223 len. 7]: -- well done , Crutches ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7224 len. 4]: cried a voice .
Parsing [sent. 7225 len. 17]: The crowd took it up , and shouted altogether , `` Well done , Crutches ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7226 len. 5]: `` Splendid , gentlemen !
Parsing [sent. 7227 len. 5]: you are doing magnificently .
Parsing [sent. 7228 len. 10]: Going , going -- '' `` A thousand ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7229 len. 6]: `` Three cheers for Green-patch !
Parsing [sent. 7230 len. 8]: Up and at him , Crutches ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7231 len. 11]: `` Going -- going -- '' `` Two thousand ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7232 len. 29]: And while the people cheered and shouted , `` Crutches '' muttered , `` Who can this devil be that is fighting so to get these useless books ?
Parsing [sent. 7233 len. 12]: -- But no matter , he sha 'n' t have them .
Parsing [sent. 7234 len. 19]: The pride of Germany shall have his books if it beggars me to buy them for him . ''
Parsing [sent. 7235 len. 13]: `` Going , going , going -- '' `` Three thousand ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7236 len. 12]: `` Come , everybody -- give a rouser for Green-patch ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7237 len. 38]: And while they did it , `` Green-patch '' muttered , `` This cripple is plainly a lunatic ; but the old scholar shall have his books , nevertheless , though my pocket sweat for it . ''
Parsing [sent. 7238 len. 11]: `` Going -- going -- '' `` Four thousand ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7239 len. 4]: `` Huzza ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7240 len. 5]: `` Five thousand ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7241 len. 4]: `` Huzza ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7242 len. 5]: `` Six thousand ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7243 len. 4]: `` Huzza ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7244 len. 5]: `` Seven thousand ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7245 len. 4]: `` Huzza ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7246 len. 5]: `` EIGHT thousand ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7247 len. 7]: `` We are saved , father !
Parsing [sent. 7248 len. 12]: I told you the Holy Virgin would keep her word ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7249 len. 8]: `` Blessed be her sacred name ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7250 len. 8]: said the old scholar , with emotion .
Parsing [sent. 7251 len. 18]: The crowd roared , `` Huzza , huzza , huzza -- at him again , Green-patch ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7252 len. 11]: `` Going -- going -- '' `` TEN thousand ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7253 len. 20]: As Givenaught shouted this , his excitement was so great that he forgot himself and used his natural voice .
Parsing [sent. 7254 len. 30]: His brother recognized it , and muttered , under cover of the storm of cheers -- `` Aha , you are there , are you , besotted old fool ?
Parsing [sent. 7255 len. 14]: Take the books , I know what you 'll do with them ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7256 len. 17]: So saying , he slipped out of the place and the auction was at an end .
Parsing [sent. 7257 len. 20]: Givenaught shouldered his way to Hildegarde , whispered a word in her ear , and then he also vanished .
Parsing [sent. 7258 len. 48]: The old scholar and his daughter embraced , and the former said , `` Truly the Holy Mother has done more than she promised , child , for she has given you a splendid marriage portion -- think of it , two thousand pieces of gold ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7259 len. 45]: `` And more still , '' cried Hildegarde , `` for she has given you back your books ; the stranger whispered me that he would none of them -- ` the honored son of Germany must keep them , ' so he said .
Parsing [sent. 7260 len. 44]: I would I might have asked his name and kissed his hand and begged his blessing ; but he was Our Lady 's angel , and it is not meet that we of earth should venture speech with them that dwell above . ''
Parsing [sent. 7261 len. 27]: APPENDIX F. German Journals The daily journals of Hamburg , Frankfort , Baden , Munich , and Augsburg are all constructed on the same general plan .
Parsing [sent. 7262 len. 18]: I speak of these because I am more familiar with them than with any other German papers .
Parsing [sent. 7263 len. 195]: They contain no `` editorials '' whatever ; no `` personals '' -- and this is rather a merit than a demerit , perhaps ; no funny-paragraph column ; no police-court reports ; no reports of proceedings of higher courts ; no information about prize-fights or other dog-fights , horse-races , walking-machines , yachting-contents , rifle-matches , or other sporting matters of any sort ; no reports of banquet speeches ; no department of curious odds and ends of floating fact and gossip ; no `` rumors '' about anything or anybody ; no prognostications or prophecies about anything or anybody ; no lists of patents granted or sought , or any reference to such things ; no abuse of public officials , big or little , or complaints against them , or praises of them ; no religious columns Saturdays , no rehash of cold sermons Mondays ; no `` weather indications '' ; no `` local item '' unveiling of what is happening in town -- nothing of a local nature , indeed , is mentioned , beyond the movements of some prince , or the proposed meeting of some deliberative body .
Parsing [sent. 7264 len. 30]: After so formidable a list of what one ca n't find in a German daily , the question may well be asked , What CAN be found in it ?
Parsing [sent. 7265 len. 30]: It is easily answered : A child 's handful of telegrams , mainly about European national and international political movements ; letter-correspondence about the same things ; market reports .
Parsing [sent. 7266 len. 5]: There you have it .
Parsing [sent. 7267 len. 10]: That is what a German daily is made of .
Parsing [sent. 7268 len. 16]: A German daily is the slowest and saddest and dreariest of the inventions of man .
Parsing [sent. 7269 len. 17]: Our own dailies infuriate the reader , pretty often ; the German daily only stupefies him .
Parsing [sent. 7270 len. 105]: Once a week the German daily of the highest class lightens up its heavy columns -- that is , it thinks it lightens them up -- with a profound , an abysmal , book criticism ; a criticism which carries you down , down , down into the scientific bowels of the subject -- for the German critic is nothing if not scientific -- and when you come up at last and scent the fresh air and see the bonny daylight once more , you resolve without a dissenting voice that a book criticism is a mistaken way to lighten up a German daily .
Parsing [sent. 7271 len. 60]: Sometimes , in place of the criticism , the first-class daily gives you what it thinks is a gay and chipper essay -- about ancient Grecian funeral customs , or the ancient Egyptian method of tarring a mummy , or the reasons for believing that some of the peoples who existed before the flood did not approve of cats .
Parsing [sent. 7272 len. 29]: These are not unpleasant subjects ; they are not uninteresting subjects ; they are even exciting subjects -- until one of these massive scientists gets hold of them .
Parsing [sent. 7273 len. 22]: He soon convinces you that even these matters can be handled in such a way as to make a person low-spirited .
Parsing [sent. 7274 len. 30]: As I have said , the average German daily is made up solely of correspondences -- a trifle of it by telegraph , the rest of it by mail .
Parsing [sent. 7275 len. 23]: Every paragraph has the side-head , `` London , '' `` Vienna , '' or some other town , and a date .
Parsing [sent. 7276 len. 39]: And always , before the name of the town , is placed a letter or a sign , to indicate who the correspondent is , so that the authorities can find him when they want to hang him .
Parsing [sent. 7277 len. 22]: Stars , crosses , triangles , squares , half-moons , suns -- such are some of the signs used by correspondents .
Parsing [sent. 7278 len. 12]: Some of the dailies move too fast , others too slowly .
Parsing [sent. 7279 len. 37]: For instance , my Heidelberg daily was always twenty-four hours old when it arrived at the hotel ; but one of my Munich evening papers used to come a full twenty-four hours before it was due .
Parsing [sent. 7280 len. 32]: Some of the less important dailies give one a tablespoonful of a continued story every day ; it is strung across the bottom of the page , in the French fashion .
Parsing [sent. 7281 len. 24]: By subscribing for the paper for five years I judge that a man might succeed in getting pretty much all of the story .
Parsing [sent. 7282 len. 43]: If you ask a citizen of Munich which is the best Munich daily journal , he will always tell you that there is only one good Munich daily , and that it is published in Augsburg , forty or fifty miles away .
Parsing [sent. 7283 len. 20]: It is like saying that the best daily paper in New York is published out in New Jersey somewhere .
Parsing [sent. 7284 len. 36]: Yes , the Augsburg ALLGEMEINE ZEITUNG is `` the best Munich paper , '' and it is the one I had in my mind when I was describing a `` first-class German daily '' above .
Parsing [sent. 7285 len. 22]: The entire paper , opened out , is not quite as large as a single page of the New York HERALD .
Parsing [sent. 7286 len. 64]: It is printed on both sides , of course ; but in such large type that its entire contents could be put , in HERALD type , upon a single page of the HERALD -- and there would still be room enough on the page for the ZEITUNG 's `` supplement '' and some portion of the ZEITUNG 's next day 's contents .
Parsing [sent. 7287 len. 6]: Such is the first-class daily .
Parsing [sent. 7288 len. 14]: The dailies actually printed in Munich are all called second-class by the public .
Parsing [sent. 7289 len. 25]: If you ask which is the best of these second-class papers they say there is no difference ; one is as good as another .
Parsing [sent. 7290 len. 25]: I have preserved a copy of one of them ; it is called the MÜNCHENER TAGES-ANZEIGER , and bears date January 25 , 1879 .
Parsing [sent. 7291 len. 37]: Comparisons are odious , but they need not be malicious ; and without any malice I wish to compare this journal , published in a German city of 170,000 inhabitants , with journals of other countries .
Parsing [sent. 7292 len. 17]: I know of no other way to enable the reader to `` size '' the thing .
Parsing [sent. 7293 len. 30]: A column of an average daily paper in America contains from 1,800 to 2,500 words ; the reading-matter in a single issue consists of from 25,000 to 50,000 words .
Parsing [sent. 7294 len. 22]: The reading-matter in my copy of the Munich journal consists of a total of 1,654 words -- for I counted them .
Parsing [sent. 7295 len. 12]: That would be nearly a column of one of our dailies .
Parsing [sent. 7296 len. 23]: A single issue of the bulkiest daily newspaper in the world -- the London TIMES -- often contains 100,000 words of reading-matter .
Parsing [sent. 7297 len. 37]: Considering that the DAILY ANZEIGER issues the usual twenty-six numbers per month , the reading matter in a single number of the London TIMES would keep it in `` copy '' two months and a half .
Parsing [sent. 7298 len. 48]: The ANZEIGER is an eight-page paper ; its page is one inch wider and one inch longer than a foolscap page ; that is to say , the dimensions of its page are somewhere between those of a schoolboy 's slate and a lady 's pocket handkerchief .
Parsing [sent. 7299 len. 49]: One-fourth of the first page is taken up with the heading of the journal ; this gives it a rather top-heavy appearance ; the rest of the first page is reading-matter ; all of the second page is reading-matter ; the other six pages are devoted to advertisements .
Parsing [sent. 7300 len. 21]: The reading-matter is compressed into two hundred and five small-pica lines , and is lighted up with eight pica headlines .
Parsing [sent. 7301 len. 59]: The bill of fare is as follows : First , under a pica headline , to enforce attention and respect , is a four-line sermon urging mankind to remember that , although they are pilgrims here below , they are yet heirs of heaven ; and that `` When they depart from earth they soar to heaven . ''
Parsing [sent. 7302 len. 31]: Perhaps a four-line sermon in a Saturday paper is the sufficient German equivalent of the eight or ten columns of sermons which the New-Yorkers get in their Monday morning papers .
Parsing [sent. 7303 len. 41]: The latest news -LRB- two days old -RRB- follows the four-line sermon , under the pica headline `` Telegrams '' -- these are `` telegraphed '' with a pair of scissors out of the AUGSBURGER ZEITUNG of the day before .
Parsing [sent. 7304 len. 24]: These telegrams consist of fourteen and two-thirds lines from Berlin , fifteen lines from Vienna , and two and five-eights lines from Calcutta .
Parsing [sent. 7305 len. 28]: Thirty-three small-pica lines of telegraphic news in a daily journal in a King 's Capital of one hundred and seventy thousand inhabitants is surely not an overdose .
Parsing [sent. 7306 len. 132]: Next we have the pica heading , `` News of the Day , '' under which the following facts are set forth : Prince Leopold is going on a visit to Vienna , six lines ; Prince Arnulph is coming back from Russia , two lines ; the Landtag will meet at ten o'clock in the morning and consider an election law , three lines and one word over ; a city government item , five and one-half lines ; prices of tickets to the proposed grand Charity Ball , twenty-three lines -- for this one item occupies almost one-fourth of the entire first page ; there is to be a wonderful Wagner concert in Frankfurt-on-the-Main , with an orchestra of one hundred and eight instruments , seven and one-half lines .
Parsing [sent. 7307 len. 6]: That concludes the first page .
Parsing [sent. 7308 len. 13]: Eighty-five lines , altogether , on that page , including three headlines .
Parsing [sent. 7309 len. 22]: About fifty of those lines , as one perceives , deal with local matters ; so the reporters are not overworked .
Parsing [sent. 7310 len. 32]: Exactly one-half of the second page is occupied with an opera criticism , fifty-three lines -LRB- three of them being headlines -RRB- , and `` Death Notices , '' ten lines .
Parsing [sent. 7311 len. 22]: The other half of the second page is made up of two paragraphs under the head of `` Miscellaneous News . ''
Parsing [sent. 7312 len. 56]: One of these paragraphs tells about a quarrel between the Czar of Russia and his eldest son , twenty-one and a half lines ; and the other tells about the atrocious destruction of a peasant child by its parents , forty lines , or one-fifth of the total of the reading-matter contained in the paper .
Parsing [sent. 7313 len. 27]: Consider what a fifth part of the reading-matter of an American daily paper issued in a city of one hundred and seventy thousand inhabitants amounts to !
Parsing [sent. 7314 len. 7]: Think what a mass it is .
Parsing [sent. 7315 len. 35]: Would any one suppose I could so snugly tuck away such a mass in a chapter of this book that it would be difficult to find it again if the reader lost his place ?
Parsing [sent. 7316 len. 3]: Surely not .
Parsing [sent. 7317 len. 97]: I will translate that child-murder word for word , to give the reader a realizing sense of what a fifth part of the reading-matter of a Munich daily actually is when it comes under measurement of the eye : `` From Oberkreuzberg , January 21st , the DONAU ZEITUNG receives a long account of a crime , which we shortened as follows : In Rametuach , a village near Eppenschlag , lived a young married couple with two children , one of which , a boy aged five , was born three years before the marriage .
Parsing [sent. 7318 len. 45]: For this reason , and also because a relative at Iggensbach had bequeathed M400 -LRB- $ 100 -RRB- to the boy , the heartless father considered him in the way ; so the unnatural parents determined to sacrifice him in the cruelest possible manner .
Parsing [sent. 7319 len. 28]: They proceeded to starve him slowly to death , meantime frightfully maltreating him -- as the village people now make known , when it is too late .
Parsing [sent. 7320 len. 24]: The boy was shut in a hole , and when people passed by he cried , and implored them to give him bread .
Parsing [sent. 7321 len. 16]: His long-continued tortures and deprivations destroyed him at last , on the third of January .
Parsing [sent. 7322 len. 27]: The sudden -LRB- sic -RRB- death of the child created suspicion , the more so as the body was immediately clothed and laid upon the bier .
Parsing [sent. 7323 len. 15]: Therefore the coroner gave notice , and an inquest was held on the 6th .
Parsing [sent. 7324 len. 8]: What a pitiful spectacle was disclosed then !
Parsing [sent. 7325 len. 7]: The body was a complete skeleton .
Parsing [sent. 7326 len. 13]: The stomach and intestines were utterly empty ; they contained nothing whatsoever .
Parsing [sent. 7327 len. 27]: The flesh on the corpse was not as thick as the back of a knife , and incisions in it brought not one drop of blood .
Parsing [sent. 7328 len. 41]: There was not a piece of sound skin the size of a dollar on the whole body ; wounds , scars , bruises , discolored extravasated blood , everywhere -- even on the soles of the feet there were wounds .
Parsing [sent. 7329 len. 34]: The cruel parents asserted that the boy had been so bad that they had been obliged to use severe punishments , and that he finally fell over a bench and broke his neck .
Parsing [sent. 7330 len. 19]: However , they were arrested two weeks after the inquest and put in the prison at Deggendorf . ''
Parsing [sent. 7331 len. 13]: Yes , they were arrested `` two weeks after the inquest . ''
Parsing [sent. 7332 len. 7]: What a home sound that has .
Parsing [sent. 7333 len. 18]: That kind of police briskness rather more reminds me of my native land than German journalism does .
Parsing [sent. 7334 len. 27]: I think a German daily journal does n't do any good to speak of , but at the same time it does n't do any harm .
Parsing [sent. 7335 len. 18]: That is a very large merit , and should not be lightly weighted nor lightly thought of .
Parsing [sent. 7336 len. 31]: The German humorous papers are beautifully printed upon fine paper , and the illustrations are finely drawn , finely engraved , and are not vapidly funny , but deliciously so .
Parsing [sent. 7337 len. 18]: So also , generally speaking , are the two or three terse sentences which accompany the pictures .
Parsing [sent. 7338 len. 23]: I remember one of these pictures : A most dilapidated tramp is ruefully contemplating some coins which lie in his open palm .
Parsing [sent. 7339 len. 12]: He says : `` Well , begging is getting played out .
Parsing [sent. 7340 len. 20]: Only about five marks -LRB- $ 1.25 -RRB- for the whole day ; many an official makes more ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7341 len. 24]: And I call to mind a picture of a commercial traveler who is about to unroll his samples : MERCHANT -LRB- pettishly -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 7342 len. 6]: -- NO , do n't .
Parsing [sent. 7343 len. 8]: I do n't want to buy anything !
Parsing [sent. 7344 len. 2]: DRUMMER .
Parsing [sent. 7345 len. 15]: -- If you please , I was only going to show you -- MERCHANT .
Parsing [sent. 7346 len. 10]: -- But I do n't wish to see them !
Parsing [sent. 7347 len. 9]: DRUMMER -LRB- after a pause , pleadingly -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 7348 len. 12]: -- But do you you mind letting ME look at them !
Parsing [sent. 7349 len. 9]: I have n't seen them for three weeks !
