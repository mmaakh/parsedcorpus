Parsing [sent. 1 len. 6]: ANNALS OF A QUIET NEIGHBOURHOOD .
Parsing [sent. 2 len. 6]: BY GEORGE MACDONALD , LL.D .
Parsing [sent. 3 len. 8]: NEW YORK CHAPTER I. DESPONDENCY AND CONSOLATION .
Parsing [sent. 4 len. 151]: Before I begin to tell you some of the things I have seen and heard , in both of which I have had to take a share , now from the compulsion of my office , now from the leading of my own heart , and now from that destiny which , including both , so often throws the man who supposed himself a mere on-looker , into the very vortex of events -- that destiny which took form to the old pagans as a gray mist high beyond the heads of their gods , but to us is known as an infinite love , revealed in the mystery of man -- I say before I begin , it is fitting that , in the absence of a common friend to do that office for me , I should introduce myself to your acquaintance , and I hope coming friendship .
Parsing [sent. 5 len. 22]: Nor can there be any impropriety in my telling you about myself , seeing I remain concealed behind my own words .
Parsing [sent. 6 len. 18]: You can never look me in the eyes , though you may look me in the soul .
Parsing [sent. 7 len. 29]: You may find me out , find my faults , my vanities , my sins , but you will not SEE me , at least in this world .
Parsing [sent. 8 len. 53]: To you I am but a voice of revealing , not a form of vision ; therefore I am bold behind the mask , to speak to you heart to heart ; bold , I say , just so much the more that I do not speak to you face to face .
Parsing [sent. 9 len. 39]: And when we meet in heaven -- well , there I know there is no hiding ; there , there is no reason for hiding anything ; there , the whole desire will be alternate revelation and vision .
Parsing [sent. 10 len. 10]: I am now getting old -- faster and faster .
Parsing [sent. 11 len. 52]: I can not help my gray hairs , nor the wrinkles that gather so slowly yet ruthlessly ; no , nor the quaver that will come in my voice , not the sense of being feeble in the knees , even when I walk only across the floor of my study .
Parsing [sent. 12 len. 10]: But I have not got used to age yet .
Parsing [sent. 13 len. 13]: I do not FEEL one atom older than I did at three-and-twenty .
Parsing [sent. 14 len. 15]: Nay , to tell all the truth , I feel a good deal younger .
Parsing [sent. 15 len. 35]: -- For then I only felt that a man had to take up his cross ; whereas now I feel that a man has to follow Him ; and that makes an unspeakable difference .
Parsing [sent. 16 len. 50]: -- When my voice quavers , I feel that it is mine and not mine ; that it just belongs to me like my watch , which does not go well-now , though it went well thirty years ago -- not more than a minute out in a month .
Parsing [sent. 17 len. 99]: And when I feel my knees shake , I think of them with a kind of pity , as I used to think of an old mare of my father 's of which I was very fond when I was a lad , and which bore me across many a field and over many a fence , but which at last came to have the same weakness in her knees that I have in mine ; and she knew it too , and took care of them , and so of herself , in a wise equine fashion .
Parsing [sent. 18 len. 59]: These things are not me -- or _ I _ , if the grammarians like it better , -LRB- I always feel a strife between doing as the scholar does and doing as other people do ;-RRB- they are not me , I say ; I HAVE them -- and , please God , shall soon have better .
Parsing [sent. 19 len. 48]: For it is not a pleasant thing for a young man , or a young woman either , I venture to say , to have an old voice , and a wrinkled face , and weak knees , and gray hair , or no hair at all .
Parsing [sent. 20 len. 50]: And if any moral Philistine , as our queer German brothers over the Northern fish-pond would call him , say that this is all rubbish , for that we ARE old , I would answer : `` Of all children how can the children of God be old ? ''
Parsing [sent. 21 len. 45]: So little do I give in to calling this outside of me , ME , that I should not mind presenting a minute description of my own person such as would at once clear me from any suspicion of vanity in so introducing myself .
Parsing [sent. 22 len. 62]: Not that my honesty would result in the least from indifference to the external -- but from comparative indifference to the transitional ; not to the transitional in itself , which is of eternal significance and result , but to the particular form of imperfection which it may have reached at any individual moment of its infinite progression towards the complete .
Parsing [sent. 23 len. 55]: For no sooner have I spoken the word NOW , than that NOW is dead and another is dying ; nay , in such a regard , there is no NOW -- only a past of which we know a little , and a future of which we know far less and far more .
Parsing [sent. 24 len. 29]: But I will not speak at all of this body of my earthly tabernacle , for it is on the whole more pleasant to forget all about it .
Parsing [sent. 25 len. 84]: And besides , I do not want to set any of my readers to whom I would have the pleasure of speaking far more openly and cordially than if they were seated on the other side of my writing-table -- I do not want to set them wondering whether the vicar be this vicar or that vicar ; or indeed to run the risk of giving the offence I might give , if I were anything else than `` a wandering voice . ''
Parsing [sent. 26 len. 16]: I did not feel as I feel now when first I came to this parish .
Parsing [sent. 27 len. 15]: For , as I have said , I am now getting old very fast .
Parsing [sent. 28 len. 38]: True , I was thirty when I was made a vicar , an age at which a man might be expected to be beginning to grow wise ; but even then I had much yet to learn .
Parsing [sent. 29 len. 42]: I well remember the first evening on which I wandered out from the vicarage to take a look about me -- to find out , in short , where I was , and what aspect the sky and earth here presented .
Parsing [sent. 30 len. 22]: Strangely enough , I had never been here before ; for the presentation had been made me while I was abroad .
Parsing [sent. 31 len. 5]: -- I was depressed .
Parsing [sent. 32 len. 5]: It was depressing weather .
Parsing [sent. 33 len. 26]: Grave doubts as to whether I was in my place in the church , would keep rising and floating about , like rain-clouds within me .
Parsing [sent. 34 len. 14]: Not that I doubted about the church ; I only doubted about myself .
Parsing [sent. 35 len. 7]: `` Were my motives pure ? ''
Parsing [sent. 36 len. 7]: `` What were my motives ? ''
Parsing [sent. 37 len. 28]: And , to tell the truth , I did not know what my motives were , and therefore I could not answer about the purity of them .
Parsing [sent. 38 len. 36]: Perhaps seeing we are in this world in order to become pure , it would be expecting too much of any young man that he should be absolutely certain that he was pure in anything .
Parsing [sent. 39 len. 40]: But the question followed very naturally : `` Had I then any right to be in the Church -- to be eating her bread and drinking her wine without knowing whether I was fit to do her work ? ''
Parsing [sent. 40 len. 20]: To which the only answer I could find was , `` The Church is part of God 's world .
Parsing [sent. 41 len. 19]: He makes men to work ; and work of some sort must be done by every honest man .
Parsing [sent. 42 len. 16]: Somehow or other , I hardly know how , I find myself in the Church .
Parsing [sent. 43 len. 13]: I do not know that I am fitter for any other work .
Parsing [sent. 44 len. 8]: I see no other work to do .
Parsing [sent. 45 len. 12]: There is work here which I can do after some fashion .
Parsing [sent. 46 len. 13]: With God 's help I will try to do it well . ''
Parsing [sent. 47 len. 13]: This resolution brought me some relief , but still I was depressed .
Parsing [sent. 48 len. 5]: It was depressing weather .
Parsing [sent. 49 len. 67]: -- I may as well say that I was not married then , and that I firmly believed I never should be married -- not from any ambition taking the form of self-denial ; nor yet from any notion that God takes pleasure in being a hard master ; but there was a lady -- Well , I WILL be honest , as I would be .
Parsing [sent. 50 len. 24]: -- I had been refused a few months before , which I think was the best thing ever happened to me except one .
Parsing [sent. 51 len. 12]: That one , of course , was when I was accepted .
Parsing [sent. 52 len. 10]: But this is not much to the purpose now .
Parsing [sent. 53 len. 6]: Only it was depressing weather .
Parsing [sent. 54 len. 19]: For is it not depressing when the rain is falling , and the steam of it is rising ?
Parsing [sent. 55 len. 35]: when the river is crawling along muddily , and the horses stand stock-still in the meadows with their spines in a straight line from the ears to where they fail utterly in the tails ?
Parsing [sent. 56 len. 18]: I should only put on goloshes now , and think of the days when I despised damp .
Parsing [sent. 57 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 58 len. 40]: it was mental waterproof that I needed then ; for let me despise damp as much as I would , I could neither keep it out of my mind , nor help suffering the spiritual rheumatism which it occasioned .
Parsing [sent. 59 len. 14]: Now , the damp never gets farther than my goloshes and my Macintosh .
Parsing [sent. 60 len. 14]: And for that worst kind of rheumatism -- I never feel it now .
Parsing [sent. 61 len. 12]: But I had begun to tell you about that first evening .
Parsing [sent. 62 len. 28]: -- I had arrived at the vicarage the night before , and it had rained all day , and was still raining , though not so much .
Parsing [sent. 63 len. 8]: I took my umbrella and went out .
Parsing [sent. 64 len. 154]: For as I wanted to do my work well -LRB- everything taking far more the shape of work to me , then , and duty , than it does now -- though , even now , I must confess things have occasionally to be done by the clergyman because there is no one else to do them , and hardly from other motive than a sense of duty , -- a man not being able to shirk work because it may happen to be dirty -RRB- -- I say , as I wanted to do my work well , or rather , perhaps , because I dreaded drudgery as much as any poor fellow who comes to the treadmill in consequence -- I wanted to interest myself in it ; and therefore I would go and fall in love , first of all , if I could , with the country round about .
Parsing [sent. 65 len. 17]: And my first step beyond my own gate was up to the ankles , in mud .
Parsing [sent. 66 len. 62]: Therewith , curiously enough , arose the distracting thought how I could possibly preach TWO good sermons a Sunday to the same people , when one of the sermons was in the afternoon instead of the evening , to which latter I had been accustomed in the large town in which I had formerly officiated as curate in a proprietary chapel .
Parsing [sent. 67 len. 75]: I , who had declaimed indignantly against excitement from without , who had been inclined to exalt the intellect at the expense even of the heart , began to fear that there must be something in the darkness , and the gas-lights , and the crowd of faces , to account for a man 's being able to preach a better sermon , and for servant girls preferring to go out in the evening .
Parsing [sent. 68 len. 2]: Alas !
Parsing [sent. 69 len. 79]: I had now to preach , as I might judge with all probability beforehand , to a company of rustics , of thought yet slower than of speech , unaccustomed in fact to THINK at all , and that in the sleepiest , deadest part of the day , when I could hardly think myself , and when , if the weather should be at all warm , I could not expect many of them to be awake .
Parsing [sent. 70 len. 14]: And what good might I look for as the result of my labour ?
Parsing [sent. 71 len. 59]: How could I hope in these men and women to kindle that fire which , in the old days of the outpouring of the Spirit , made men live with the sense of the kingdom of heaven about them , and the expectation of something glorious at hand just outside that invisible door which lay between the worlds ?
Parsing [sent. 72 len. 35]: I have learned since , that perhaps I overrated the spirituality of those times , and underrated , not being myself spiritual enough to see all about me , the spirituality of these times .
Parsing [sent. 73 len. 77]: I think I have learned since , that the parson of a parish must be content to keep the upper windows of his mind open to the holy winds and the pure lights of heaven ; and the side windows of tone , of speech , of behaviour open to the earth , to let forth upon his fellow-men the tenderness and truth which those upper influences bring forth in any region exposed to their operation .
Parsing [sent. 74 len. 45]: Believing in his Master , such a servant shall not make haste ; shall feel no feverous desire to behold the work of his hands ; shall be content to be as his Master , who waiteth long for the fruits of His earth .
Parsing [sent. 75 len. 31]: But surely I am getting older than I thought ; for I keep wandering away from my subject , which is this , my first walk in my new cure .
Parsing [sent. 76 len. 28]: My excuse is , that I want my reader to understand something of the state of my mind , and the depression under which I was labouring .
Parsing [sent. 77 len. 32]: He will perceive that I desired to do some work worth calling by the name of work , and that I did not see how to get hold of a beginning .
Parsing [sent. 78 len. 26]: I had not gone far from my own gate before the rain ceased , though it was still gloomy enough for any amount to follow .
Parsing [sent. 79 len. 13]: I drew down my umbrella , and began to look about me .
Parsing [sent. 80 len. 26]: The stream on my left was so swollen that I could see its brown in patches through the green of the meadows along its banks .
Parsing [sent. 81 len. 59]: A little in front of me , the road , rising quickly , took a sharp turn to pass along an old stone bridge that spanned the water with a single fine arch , somewhat pointed ; and through the arch I could see the river stretching away up through the meadows , its banks bordered with pollards .
Parsing [sent. 82 len. 8]: Now , pollards always made me miserable .
Parsing [sent. 83 len. 28]: In the first place , they look ill-used ; in the next place , they look tame ; in the third place , they look very ugly .
Parsing [sent. 84 len. 77]: I had not learned then to honour them on the ground that they yield not a jot to the adversity of their circumstances ; that , if they must be pollards , they still will be trees ; and what they may not do with grace , they will yet do with bounty ; that , in short , their life bursts forth , despite of all that is done to repress and destroy their individuality .
Parsing [sent. 85 len. 25]: When you have once learned to honour anything , love is not very far off ; at least that has always been my experience .
Parsing [sent. 86 len. 28]: But , as I have said , I had not yet learned to honour pollards , and therefore they made me more miserable than I was already .
Parsing [sent. 87 len. 94]: When , having followed the road , I stood at last on the bridge , and , looking up and down the river through the misty air , saw two long rows of these pollards diminishing till they vanished in both directions , the sight of them took from me all power of enjoying the water beneath me , the green fields around me , or even the old-world beauty of the little bridge upon which I stood , although all sorts of bridges have been from very infancy a delight to me .
Parsing [sent. 88 len. 33]: For I am one of those who never get rid of their infantile predilections , and to have once enjoyed making a mud bridge , was to enjoy all bridges for ever .
Parsing [sent. 89 len. 49]: I saw a man in a white smock-frock coming along the road beyond , but I turned my back to the road , leaned my arms on the parapet of the bridge , and stood gazing where I saw no visions , namely , at those very poplars .
Parsing [sent. 90 len. 23]: I heard the man 's footsteps coming up the crown of the arch , but I would not turn to greet him .
Parsing [sent. 91 len. 30]: I was in a selfish humour if ever I was ; for surely if ever one man ought to greet another , it was upon such a comfortless afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 92 len. 29]: The footsteps stopped behind me , and I heard a voice : -- `` I beg yer pardon , sir ; but be you the new vicar ? ''
Parsing [sent. 93 len. 10]: I turned instantly and answered , `` I am .
Parsing [sent. 94 len. 6]: Do you want me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 95 len. 23]: `` I wanted to see yer face , sir , that was all , if ye 'll not take it amiss . ''
Parsing [sent. 96 len. 25]: Before me stood a tall old man with his hat in his hand , clothed as I have said , in a white smock-frock .
Parsing [sent. 97 len. 18]: He smoothed his short gray hair with his curved palm down over his forehead as he stood .
Parsing [sent. 98 len. 15]: His face was of a red brown , from much exposure to the weather .
Parsing [sent. 99 len. 33]: There was a certain look of roughness , without hardness , in it , which spoke of endurance rather than resistance , although he could evidently set his face as a flint .
Parsing [sent. 100 len. 40]: His features were large and a little coarse , but the smile that parted his lips when he spoke , shone in his gray eyes as well , and lighted up a countenance in which a man might trust .
Parsing [sent. 101 len. 19]: `` I wanted to see yer face , sir , if you 'll not take it amiss . ''
Parsing [sent. 102 len. 28]: `` Certainly not , '' I answered , pleased with the man 's address , as he stood square before me , looking as modest as fearless .
Parsing [sent. 103 len. 36]: `` The sight of a man 's face is what everybody has a right to ; but , for all that , I should like to know why you want to see my face . ''
Parsing [sent. 104 len. 11]: `` Why , sir , you be the new vicar .
Parsing [sent. 105 len. 11]: You kindly told me so when I axed you . ''
Parsing [sent. 106 len. 26]: `` Well , then , you 'll see my face on Sunday in church -- that is , if you happen to be there . ''
Parsing [sent. 107 len. 29]: For , although some might think it the more dignified way , I could not take it as a matter of course that he would be at church .
Parsing [sent. 108 len. 30]: A man might have better reasons for staying away from church than I had for going , even though I was the parson , and it was my business .
Parsing [sent. 109 len. 17]: Some clergymen separate between themselves and their office to a degree which I can not understand .
Parsing [sent. 110 len. 75]: To assert the dignities of my office seems to me very like exalting myself ; and when I have had a twinge of conscience about it , as has happened more than once , I have then found comfort in these two texts : `` The Son of man came not to be ministered unto but to minister ; '' and `` It is enough that the servant should be as his master . ''
Parsing [sent. 111 len. 28]: Neither have I ever been able to see the very great difference between right and wrong in a clergyman , and right and wrong in another man .
Parsing [sent. 112 len. 40]: All that I can pretend to have yet discovered comes to this : that what is right in another man is right in a clergyman ; and what is wrong in another man is much worse in a clergyman .
Parsing [sent. 113 len. 12]: Here , however , is one more proof of approaching age .
Parsing [sent. 114 len. 11]: I do not mean the opinion , but the digression .
Parsing [sent. 115 len. 28]: `` Well , then , '' I said , `` you 'll see my face in church on Sunday , if you happen to be there . ''
Parsing [sent. 116 len. 55]: `` Yes , sir ; but you see , sir , on the bridge here , the parson is the parson like , and I 'm Old Rogers ; and I looks in his face , and he looks in mine , and I says to myself , ` This is my parson . '
Parsing [sent. 117 len. 33]: But o ' Sundays he 's nobody 's parson ; he 's got his work to do , and it mun be done , and there 's an end o n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 118 len. 27]: That there was a real idea in the old man 's mind was considerably clearer than the logic by which he tried to bring it out .
Parsing [sent. 119 len. 12]: `` Did you know parson that 's gone , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 120 len. 4]: he went on .
Parsing [sent. 121 len. 7]: `` No , '' I answered .
Parsing [sent. 122 len. 5]: `` Oh , sir !
Parsing [sent. 123 len. 6]: he wur a good parson .
Parsing [sent. 124 len. 35]: Many 's the time he come and sit at my son 's bedside -- him that 's dead and gone , sir -- for a long hour , on a Saturday night , too .
Parsing [sent. 125 len. 40]: And then when I see him up in the desk the next mornin ' , I 'd say to myself , ` Old Rogers , that 's the same man as sat by your son 's bedside last night .
Parsing [sent. 126 len. 9]: Think o ' that , Old Rogers ! '
Parsing [sent. 127 len. 15]: But , somehow , I never did feel right sure o ' that same .
Parsing [sent. 128 len. 22]: He did n't seem to have the same cut , somehow ; and he did n't talk a bit the same .
Parsing [sent. 129 len. 52]: And when he spoke to me after sermon , in the church-yard , I was always of a mind to go into the church again and look up to the pulpit to see if he war really out ov it ; for this war n't the same man , you see .
Parsing [sent. 130 len. 16]: But you 'll know all about it better than I can tell you , sir .
Parsing [sent. 131 len. 49]: Only I always liked parson better out o ' the pulpit , and that 's how I come to want to make you look at me , sir , instead o ' the water down there , afore I see you in the church to-morrow mornin ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 132 len. 29]: The old man laughed a kindly laugh ; but he had set me thinking , and I did not know what to say to him all at once .
Parsing [sent. 133 len. 36]: So after a short pause , he resumed -- `` You 'll be thinking me a queer kind of a man , sir , to speak to my betters before my betters speaks to me .
Parsing [sent. 134 len. 27]: But mayhap you do n't know what a parson is to us poor folk that has ne'er a friend more larned than theirselves but the parson .
Parsing [sent. 135 len. 61]: And besides , sir , I 'm an old salt , -- an old man-o ' - war 's man , -- and I 've been all round the world , sir ; and I ha ' been in all sorts o ' company , pirates and all , sir ; and I aint a bit frightened of a parson .
Parsing [sent. 136 len. 9]: No ; I love a parson , sir .
Parsing [sent. 137 len. 10]: And I 'll tell you for why , sir .
Parsing [sent. 138 len. 19]: He 's got a good telescope , and he gits to the masthead , and he looks out .
Parsing [sent. 139 len. 10]: And he sings out , ` Land ahead ! '
Parsing [sent. 140 len. 6]: or ` Breakers ahead ! '
Parsing [sent. 141 len. 6]: and gives directions accordin ' .
Parsing [sent. 142 len. 11]: Only I ca n't always make out what he says .
Parsing [sent. 143 len. 38]: But when he shuts up his spyglass , and comes down the riggin ' , and talks to us like one man to another , then I do n't know what I should do without the parson .
Parsing [sent. 144 len. 14]: Good evenin ' to you , sir , and welcome to Marshmallows . ''
Parsing [sent. 145 len. 9]: The pollards did not look half so dreary .
Parsing [sent. 146 len. 19]: The river began to glimmer a little ; and the old bridge had become an interesting old bridge .
Parsing [sent. 147 len. 9]: The country altogether was rather nice than otherwise .
Parsing [sent. 148 len. 7]: I had found a friend already !
Parsing [sent. 149 len. 34]: -- that is , a man to whom I might possibly be of some use ; and that was the most precious friend I could think of in my present situation and mood .
Parsing [sent. 150 len. 31]: I had learned something from him too ; and I resolved to try all I could to be the same man in the pulpit that I was out of it .
Parsing [sent. 151 len. 29]: Some may be inclined to say that I had better have formed the resolution to be the same man out of the pulpit that I was in it .
Parsing [sent. 152 len. 11]: But the one will go quite right with the other .
Parsing [sent. 153 len. 58]: Out of the pulpit I would be the same man I was in it -- seeing and feeling the realities of the unseen ; and in the pulpit I would be the same man I was out of it -- taking facts as they are , and dealing with things as they show themselves in the world .
Parsing [sent. 154 len. 17]: One other occurrence before I went home that evening , and I shall close the chapter .
Parsing [sent. 155 len. 12]: I hope I shall not write another so dull as this .
Parsing [sent. 156 len. 18]: I dare not promise , though ; for this is a new kind of work to me .
Parsing [sent. 157 len. 103]: Before I left the bridge , -- while , in fact , I was contemplating the pollards with an eye , if not of favour , yet of diminished dismay , -- the sun , which , for anything I knew of his whereabouts , either from knowledge of the country , aspect of the evening , or state of my own feelings , might have been down for an hour or two , burst his cloudy bands , and blazed out as if he had just risen from the dead , instead of being just about to sink into the grave .
Parsing [sent. 158 len. 47]: Do not tell me that my figure is untrue , for that the sun never sinks into the grave , else I will retort that it is just as true of the sun as of a man ; for that no man sinks into the grave .
Parsing [sent. 159 len. 4]: He only disappears .
Parsing [sent. 160 len. 23]: Life IS a constant sunrise , which death can not interrupt , any more than the night can swallow up the sun .
Parsing [sent. 161 len. 22]: `` God is not the God of the dead , but of the living ; for all live unto him . ''
Parsing [sent. 162 len. 8]: Well , the sun shone out gloriously .
Parsing [sent. 163 len. 59]: The whole sweep of the gloomy river answered him in gladness ; the wet leaves of the pollards quivered and glanced ; the meadows offered up their perfect green , fresh and clear out of the trouble of the rain ; and away in the distance , upon a rising ground covered with trees , glittered a weathercock .
Parsing [sent. 164 len. 16]: What if I found afterwards that it was only on the roof of a stable ?
Parsing [sent. 165 len. 8]: It shone , and that was enough .
Parsing [sent. 166 len. 61]: And when the sun had gone below the horizon , and the fields and the river were dusky once more , there it glittered still over the darkening earth , a symbol of that faith which is `` the evidence of things not seen , '' and it made my heart swell as at a chant from the prophet Isaiah .
Parsing [sent. 167 len. 13]: What matter then whether it hung over a stable-roof or a church-tower ?
Parsing [sent. 168 len. 18]: I stood up and wandered a little farther -- off the bridge , and along the road .
Parsing [sent. 169 len. 23]: I had not gone far before I passed a house , out of which came a young woman leading a little boy .
Parsing [sent. 170 len. 20]: They came after me , the boy gazing at the red and gold and green of the sunset sky .
Parsing [sent. 171 len. 23]: As they passed me , the child said -- `` Auntie , I think I should like to be a painter . ''
Parsing [sent. 172 len. 4]: `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 173 len. 4]: returned his companion .
Parsing [sent. 174 len. 21]: `` Because , then , '' answered the child , `` I could help God to paint the sky . ''
Parsing [sent. 175 len. 17]: What his aunt replied I do not know ; for they were presently beyond my hearing .
Parsing [sent. 176 len. 12]: But I went on answering him myself all the way home .
Parsing [sent. 177 len. 46]: Did God care to paint the sky of an evening , that a few of His children might see it , and get just a hope , just an aspiration , out of its passing green , and gold , and purple , and red ?
Parsing [sent. 178 len. 20]: and should I think my day 's labour lost , if it wrought no visible salvation in the earth ?
Parsing [sent. 179 len. 9]: But was the child 's aspiration in vain ?
Parsing [sent. 180 len. 15]: Could I tell him God did not want his help to paint the sky ?
Parsing [sent. 181 len. 15]: True , he could mount no scaffold against the infinite of the glowing west .
Parsing [sent. 182 len. 34]: But might he not with his little palette and brush , when the time came , show his brothers and sisters what he had seen there , and make them see it too ?
Parsing [sent. 183 len. 28]: Might he not thus come , after long trying , to help God to paint this glory of vapour and light inside the minds of His children ?
Parsing [sent. 184 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 185 len. 24]: if any man 's work is not WITH God , its results shall be burned , ruthlessly burned , because poor and bad .
Parsing [sent. 186 len. 51]: `` So , for my part , '' I said to myself , as I walked home , `` if I can put one touch of a rosy sunset into the life of any man or woman of my cure , I shall feel that I have worked with God .
Parsing [sent. 187 len. 30]: He is in no haste ; and if I do what I may in earnest , I need not mourn if I work no great work on the earth .
Parsing [sent. 188 len. 14]: Let God make His sunsets : I will mottle my little fading cloud .
Parsing [sent. 189 len. 32]: To help the growth of a thought that struggles towards the light ; to brush with gentle hand the earth-stain from the white of one snowdrop -- such be my ambition !
Parsing [sent. 190 len. 20]: So shall I scale the rocks in front , not leave my name carved upon those behind me . ''
Parsing [sent. 191 len. 6]: People talk about special providences .
Parsing [sent. 192 len. 12]: I believe in the providences , but not in the specialty .
Parsing [sent. 193 len. 29]: I do not believe that God lets the thread of my affairs go for six days , and on the seventh evening takes it up for a moment .
Parsing [sent. 194 len. 21]: The so-called special providences are no exception to the rule -- they are common to all men at all moments .
Parsing [sent. 195 len. 30]: But it is a fact that God 's care is more evident in some instances of it than in others to the dim and often bewildered vision of humanity .
Parsing [sent. 196 len. 10]: Upon such instances men seize and call them providences .
Parsing [sent. 197 len. 26]: It is well that they can ; but it would be gloriously better if they could believe that the whole matter is one grand providence .
Parsing [sent. 198 len. 119]: I was one of such men at the time , and could not fail to see what I called a special providence in this , that on my first attempt to find where I stood in the scheme of Providence , and while I was discouraged with regard to the work before me , I should fall in with these two -- an old man whom I could help , and a child who could help me ; the one opening an outlet for my labour and my love , and the other reminding me of the highest source of the most humbling comfort , -- that in all my work I might be a fellow-worker with God .
Parsing [sent. 199 len. 3]: CHAPTER II .
Parsing [sent. 200 len. 6]: MY FIRST SUNDAY AT MARSHMALLOWS .
Parsing [sent. 201 len. 8]: These events fell on the Saturday night .
Parsing [sent. 202 len. 11]: On the Sunday morning , I read prayers and preached .
Parsing [sent. 203 len. 44]: Never before had I enjoyed so much the petitions of the Church , which Hooker calls `` the sending of angels upward , '' or the reading of the lessons , which he calls `` the receiving of angels descended from above . ''
Parsing [sent. 204 len. 32]: And whether from the newness of the parson , or the love of the service , certainly a congregation more intent , or more responsive , a clergyman will hardly find .
Parsing [sent. 205 len. 14]: But , as I had feared , it was different in the afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 206 len. 40]: The people had dined , and the usual somnolence had followed ; nor could I find in my heart to blame men and women who worked hard all the week , for being drowsy on the day of rest .
Parsing [sent. 207 len. 42]: So I curtailed my sermon as much as I could , omitting page after page of my manuscript ; and when I came to a close , was rewarded by perceiving an agreeable surprise upon many of the faces round me .
Parsing [sent. 208 len. 21]: I resolved that , in the afternoons at least , my sermons should be as short as heart could wish .
Parsing [sent. 209 len. 19]: But that afternoon there was at least one man of the congregation who was neither drowsy nor inattentive .
Parsing [sent. 210 len. 16]: Repeatedly my eyes left the page off which I was reading and glanced towards him .
Parsing [sent. 211 len. 12]: Not once did I find his eyes turned away from me .
Parsing [sent. 212 len. 68]: There was a small loft in the west end of the church , in which stood a little organ , whose voice , weakened by years of praising , and possibly of neglect , had yet , among a good many tones that were rough , wooden , and reedy , a few remaining that were as mellow as ever praiseful heart could wish to praise withal .
Parsing [sent. 213 len. 45]: And these came in amongst the rest like trusting thoughts amidst `` eating cares ; '' like the faces of children borne in the arms of a crowd of anxious mothers ; like hopes that are young prophecies amidst the downward sweep of events .
Parsing [sent. 214 len. 29]: For , though I do not understand music , I have a keen ear for the perfection of the single tone , or the completeness of the harmony .
Parsing [sent. 215 len. 9]: But of this organ more by and by .
Parsing [sent. 216 len. 32]: Now this little gallery was something larger than was just necessary for the organ and its ministrants , and a few of the parishioners had chosen to sit in its fore-front .
Parsing [sent. 217 len. 17]: Upon this occasion there was no one there but the man to whom I have referred .
Parsing [sent. 218 len. 19]: The space below this gallery was not included in the part of the church used for the service .
Parsing [sent. 219 len. 21]: It was claimed by the gardener of the place , that is the sexton , to hold his gardening tools .
Parsing [sent. 220 len. 45]: There were a few ancient carvings in wood lying in it , very brown in the dusky light that came through a small lancet window , opening , not to the outside , but into the tower , itself dusky with an enduring twilight .
Parsing [sent. 221 len. 49]: And there were some broken old headstones , and the kindly spade and pickaxe -- but I have really nothing to do with these now , for I am , as it were , in the pulpit , whence one ought to look beyond such things as these .
Parsing [sent. 222 len. 60]: Rising against the screen which separated this mouldy portion of the church from the rest , stood an old monument of carved wood , once brilliantly painted in the portions that bore the arms of the family over whose vault it stood , but now all bare and worn , itself gently flowing away into the dust it commemorated .
Parsing [sent. 223 len. 48]: It lifted its gablet , carved to look like a canopy , till its apex was on a level with the book-board on the front of the organ-loft ; and over -- in fact upon this apex appeared the face of the man whom I have mentioned .
Parsing [sent. 224 len. 30]: It was a very remarkable countenance -- pale , and very thin , without any hair , except that of thick eyebrows that far over-hung keen , questioning eyes .
Parsing [sent. 225 len. 20]: Short bushy hair , gray , not white , covered a well formed head with a high narrow forehead .
Parsing [sent. 226 len. 38]: As I have said , those keen eyes kept looking at me from under their gray eyebrows all the time of the sermon -- intelligently without doubt , but whether sympathetically or otherwise I could not determine .
Parsing [sent. 227 len. 7]: And indeed I hardly know yet .
Parsing [sent. 228 len. 35]: My vestry door opened upon a little group of graves , simple and green , without headstone or slab ; poor graves , the memory of whose occupants no one had cared to preserve .
Parsing [sent. 229 len. 23]: Good men must have preceded me here , else the poor would not have lain so near the chancel and the vestry-door .
Parsing [sent. 230 len. 43]: All about and beyond were stones , with here and there a monument ; for mine was a large parish , and there were old and rich families in it , more of which buried their dead here than assembled their living .
Parsing [sent. 231 len. 15]: But close by the vestry-door , there was this little billowy lake of grass .
Parsing [sent. 232 len. 54]: And at the end of the narrow path leading from the door , was the churchyard wall , with a few steps on each side of it , that the parson might pass at once from the churchyard into his own shrubbery , here tangled , almost matted , from luxuriance of growth .
Parsing [sent. 233 len. 14]: But I would not creep out the back way from among my people .
Parsing [sent. 234 len. 25]: That way might do very well to come in by ; but to go out , I would use the door of the people .
Parsing [sent. 235 len. 40]: So I went along the church , a fine old place , such as I had never hoped to be presented to , and went out by the door in the north side into the middle of the churchyard .
Parsing [sent. 236 len. 73]: The door on the other side was chiefly used by the few gentry of the neighbourhood ; and the Lych-gate , with its covered way , -LRB- for the main road had once passed on that side , -RRB- was shared between the coffins and the carriages , the dead who had no rank but one , that of the dead , and the living who had more money than their neighbours .
Parsing [sent. 237 len. 93]: For , let the old gentry disclaim it as they may , mere wealth , derived from whatever source , will sooner reach their level than poor antiquity , or the rarest refinement of personal worth ; although , to be sure , the oldest of them will sooner give to the rich their sons or their daughters to wed , to love if they can , to have children by , than they will yield a jot of their ancestral preeminence , or acknowledge any equality in their sons or daughters-in-law .
Parsing [sent. 238 len. 16]: The carpenter 's son is to them an old myth , not an everlasting fact .
Parsing [sent. 239 len. 18]: To Mammon alone will they yield a little of their rank -- none of it to Christ .
Parsing [sent. 240 len. 10]: Let me glorify God that Jesus took not on .
Parsing [sent. 241 len. 24]: Him the nature of nobles , but the seed of Adam ; for what could I do without my poor brothers and sisters ?
Parsing [sent. 242 len. 14]: I passed along the church to the northern door , and went out .
Parsing [sent. 243 len. 7]: The churchyard lay in bright sunshine .
Parsing [sent. 244 len. 8]: All the rain and gloom were gone .
Parsing [sent. 245 len. 21]: `` If one could only bring this glory of sun and grass into one 's hope for the future ! ''
Parsing [sent. 246 len. 29]: thought I ; and looking down I saw the little boy who aspired to paint the sky , looking up in my face with mingled confidence and awe .
Parsing [sent. 247 len. 11]: `` Do you trust me , my little man ? ''
Parsing [sent. 248 len. 9]: thought I. `` You shall trust me then .
Parsing [sent. 249 len. 18]: But I wo n't be a priest to you , I 'll be a big brother . ''
Parsing [sent. 250 len. 10]: For the priesthood passes away , the brotherhood endures .
Parsing [sent. 251 len. 11]: The priesthood passes away , swallowed up in the brotherhood .
Parsing [sent. 252 len. 23]: It is because men can not learn simple things , can not believe in the brotherhood , that they need a priesthood .
Parsing [sent. 253 len. 16]: But as Dr Arnold said of the Sunday , `` They DO need it . ''
Parsing [sent. 254 len. 23]: And I , for one , am sure that the priesthood needs the people much more than the people needs the priesthood .
Parsing [sent. 255 len. 14]: So I stooped and lifted the child and held him in my arms .
Parsing [sent. 256 len. 21]: And the little fellow looked at me one moment longer , and then put his arms gently round my neck .
Parsing [sent. 257 len. 6]: And so we were friends .
Parsing [sent. 258 len. 36]: When I had set him down , which I did presently , for I shuddered at the idea of the people thinking that I was showing off the CLERGYMAN , I looked at the boy .
Parsing [sent. 259 len. 27]: In his face was great sweetness mingled with great rusticity , and I could not tell whether he was the child of gentlefolk or of peasants .
Parsing [sent. 260 len. 27]: He did not say a word , but walked away to join his aunt , who was waiting for him at the gate of the churchyard .
Parsing [sent. 261 len. 43]: He kept his head turned towards me , however , as he went , so that , not seeing where he was going , he stumbled over the grave of a child , and fell in the hollow on the other side .
Parsing [sent. 262 len. 7]: I ran to pick him up .
Parsing [sent. 263 len. 9]: His aunt reached him at the same moment .
Parsing [sent. 264 len. 9]: `` Oh , thank you , sir ! ''
Parsing [sent. 265 len. 35]: she said , as I gave him to her , with an earnestness which seemed to me disproportionate to the deed , and carried him away with a deep blush over all her countenance .
Parsing [sent. 266 len. 18]: At the churchyard-gate , the old man-of-war 's man was waiting to have another look at me .
Parsing [sent. 267 len. 39]: His hat was in his hand , and he gave a pull to the short hair over his forehead , as if he would gladly take that off too , to show his respect for the new parson .
Parsing [sent. 268 len. 7]: I held out my hand gratefully .
Parsing [sent. 269 len. 16]: It could not close around the hard , unyielding mass of fingers which met it .
Parsing [sent. 270 len. 16]: He did not know how to shake hands , and left it all to me .
Parsing [sent. 271 len. 7]: But pleasure sparkled in his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 272 len. 18]: `` My old woman would like to shake hands with you , sir , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 273 len. 58]: Beside him stood his old woman , in a portentous bonnet , beneath whose gay yellow ribbons appeared a dusky old face , wrinkled like a ship 's timbers , out of which looked a pair of keen black eyes , where the best beauty , that of loving-kindness , had not merely lingered , but triumphed .
Parsing [sent. 274 len. 21]: `` I shall be in to see you soon , '' I said , as I shook hands with her .
Parsing [sent. 275 len. 10]: `` I shall find out where you live . ''
Parsing [sent. 276 len. 17]: `` Down by the mill , '' she said ; `` close by it , sir .
Parsing [sent. 277 len. 26]: There 's one bed in our garden that always thrives , in the hottest summer , by the plash from the mill , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 278 len. 13]: `` Ask for Old Rogers , sir , '' said the man .
Parsing [sent. 279 len. 6]: `` Everybody knows Old Rogers .
Parsing [sent. 280 len. 16]: But if your reverence minds what my wife says , you wo n't go wrong .
Parsing [sent. 281 len. 44]: When you find the river , it takes you to the mill ; and when you find the mill , you find the wheel ; and when you find the wheel , you have n't far to look for the cottage , sir .
Parsing [sent. 282 len. 15]: It 's a poor place , but you 'll be welcome , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 283 len. 3]: CHAPTER III .
Parsing [sent. 284 len. 6]: MY FIRST MONDAY AT MARSHMALLOWS .
Parsing [sent. 285 len. 9]: The next day I might expect some visitors .
Parsing [sent. 286 len. 30]: It is a fortunate thing that English society now regards the parson as a gentleman , else he would have little chance of being useful to the UPPER CLASSES .
Parsing [sent. 287 len. 25]: But I wanted to get a good start of them , and see some of my poor before my rich came to see me .
Parsing [sent. 288 len. 47]: So after breakfast , on as lovely a Monday in the beginning of autumn as ever came to comfort a clergyman in the reaction of his efforts to feed his flock on the Sunday , I walked out , and took my way to the village .
Parsing [sent. 289 len. 22]: I strove to dismiss from my mind every feeling of DOING DUTY , of PERFORMING MY PART , and all that .
Parsing [sent. 290 len. 18]: I had a horror of becoming a moral policeman as much as of `` doing church . ''
Parsing [sent. 291 len. 20]: I would simply enjoy the privilege , more open to me in virtue of my office , of ministering .
Parsing [sent. 292 len. 34]: But as no servant has a right to force his service , so I would be the NEIGHBOUR only , until such time as the opportunity of being the servant should show itself .
Parsing [sent. 293 len. 32]: The village was as irregular as a village should be , partly consisting of those white houses with intersecting parallelograms of black which still abound in some regions of our island .
Parsing [sent. 294 len. 58]: Just in the centre , however , grouping about an old house of red brick , which had once been a manorial residence , but was now subdivided in all modes that analytic ingenuity could devise , rose a portion of it which , from one point of view , might seem part of an old town .
Parsing [sent. 295 len. 56]: But you had only to pass round any one of three visible corners to see stacks of wheat and a farm-yard ; while in another direction the houses went straggling away into a wood that looked very like the beginning of a forest , of which some of the village orchards appeared to form part .
Parsing [sent. 296 len. 15]: From the street the slow-winding , poplar-bordered stream was here and there just visible .
Parsing [sent. 297 len. 14]: I did not quite like to have it between me and my village .
Parsing [sent. 298 len. 52]: I could not help preferring that homely relation in which the houses are built up like swallow-nests on to the very walls of the cathedrals themselves , to the arrangement here , where the river flowed , with what flow there was in it , between the church and the people .
Parsing [sent. 299 len. 25]: A little way beyond the farther end of the village appeared an iron gate , of considerable size , dividing a lofty stone wall .
Parsing [sent. 300 len. 55]: And upon the top of that one of the stone pillars supporting the gate which I could see , stood a creature of stone , whether natant , volant , passant , couchant , or rampant , I could not tell , only it looked like something terrible enough for a quite antediluvian heraldry .
Parsing [sent. 301 len. 53]: As I passed along the street , wondering with myself what relations between me and these houses were hidden in the future , my eye was caught by the window of a little shop , in which strings of beads and elephants of gingerbread formed the chief samples of the goods within .
Parsing [sent. 302 len. 16]: It was a window much broader than it was high , divided into lozenge-shaped panes .
Parsing [sent. 303 len. 32]: Wondering what kind of old woman presided over the treasures in this cave of Aladdin , I thought to make a first of my visits by going in and buying something .
Parsing [sent. 304 len. 28]: But I hesitated , because I could not think of anything I was in want of -- at least that the old woman was likely to have .
Parsing [sent. 305 len. 23]: To be sure I wanted a copy of Bengel 's `` Gnomon ; '' but she was not likely to have that .
Parsing [sent. 306 len. 25]: I wanted the fourth plate in the third volume of Law 's `` Behmen ; '' she was not likely to have that either .
Parsing [sent. 307 len. 19]: I did not care for gingerbread ; and I had no little girl to take home beads to .
Parsing [sent. 308 len. 12]: But why should I not go in without an ostensible errand ?
Parsing [sent. 309 len. 26]: For this reason : there are dissenters everywhere , and I could not tell but I might be going into the shop of a dissenter .
Parsing [sent. 310 len. 50]: Now , though , I confess , nothing would have pleased me better than that all the dissenters should return to their old home in the Church , I could not endure the suspicion of laying myself out to entice them back by canvassing or using any personal influence .
Parsing [sent. 311 len. 74]: Whether they returned or not , however , -LRB- and I did not expect many would , -RRB- I hoped still , some day , to stand towards every one of them in the relation of the parson of the parish , that is , one of whom each might feel certain that he was ready to serve him or her at any hour when he might be wanted to render a service .
Parsing [sent. 312 len. 10]: In the meantime , I could not help hesitating .
Parsing [sent. 313 len. 68]: I had almost made up my mind to ask if she had a small pocket compass , for I had seen such things in little country shops -- I am afraid only in France , though -- when the door opened , and out came the little boy whom I had already seen twice , and who was therefore one of my oldest friends in the place .
Parsing [sent. 314 len. 24]: He came across the road to me , took me by the hand , and said -- `` Come and see mother . ''
Parsing [sent. 315 len. 7]: `` Where , my dear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 316 len. 3]: I asked .
Parsing [sent. 317 len. 10]: `` In the shop there , '' he answered .
Parsing [sent. 318 len. 9]: `` Is it your mother 's shop ? ''
Parsing [sent. 319 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 320 len. 9]: I said no more , but accompanied him .
Parsing [sent. 321 len. 32]: Of course my expectation of seeing an old woman behind the counter had vanished , but I was not in the least prepared for the kind of woman I did see .
Parsing [sent. 322 len. 11]: The place was half a shop and half a kitchen .
Parsing [sent. 323 len. 24]: A yard or so of counter stretched inwards from the door , just as a hint to those who might be intrusively inclined .
Parsing [sent. 324 len. 17]: Beyond this , by the chimney-corner , sat the mother , who rose as we entered .
Parsing [sent. 325 len. 34]: She was certainly one -- I do not say of the most beautiful , but , until I have time to explain further -- of the most remarkable women I had ever seen .
Parsing [sent. 326 len. 28]: Her face was absolutely white -- no , pale cream-colour -- except her lips and a spot upon each cheek , which glowed with a deep carmine .
Parsing [sent. 327 len. 25]: You would have said she had been painting , and painting very inartistically , so little was the red shaded into the surrounding white .
Parsing [sent. 328 len. 7]: Now this was certainly not beautiful .
Parsing [sent. 329 len. 33]: Indeed , it occasioned a strange feeling , almost of terror , at first , for she reminded one of the spectre woman in the `` Rime of the Ancient Mariner . ''
Parsing [sent. 330 len. 21]: But when I got used to her complexion , I saw that the form of her features was quite beautiful .
Parsing [sent. 331 len. 17]: She might indeed have been LOVELY but for a certain hardness which showed through the beauty .
Parsing [sent. 332 len. 17]: This might have been the result of ill health , ill-endured ; but I doubted it .
Parsing [sent. 333 len. 43]: For there was a certain modelling of the cheeks and lips which showed that the teeth within were firmly closed ; and , taken with the look of the eyes and forehead , seemed the expression of a constant and bitter self-command .
Parsing [sent. 334 len. 55]: But there were indubitable marks of ill health upon her , notwithstanding ; for not to mention her complexion , her large dark eye was burning as if the lamp of life had broken and the oil was blazing ; and there was a slight expansion of the nostrils , which indicated physical unrest .
Parsing [sent. 335 len. 23]: But her manner was perfectly , almost dreadfully , quiet ; her voice soft , low , and chiefly expressive of indifference .
Parsing [sent. 336 len. 18]: She spoke without looking me in the face , but did not seem either shy or ashamed .
Parsing [sent. 337 len. 13]: Her figure was remarkably graceful , though too worn to be beautiful .
Parsing [sent. 338 len. 9]: -- Here was a strange parishioner for me !
Parsing [sent. 339 len. 8]: -- in a country toy-shop , too !
Parsing [sent. 340 len. 24]: As soon as the little fellow had brought me in , he shrunk away through a half-open door that revealed a stair behind .
Parsing [sent. 341 len. 11]: `` What can I do for you , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 342 len. 36]: said the mother , coldly , and with a kind of book-propriety of speech , as she stood on the other side of the little counter , prepared to open box or drawer at command .
Parsing [sent. 343 len. 14]: `` To tell the truth , I hardly know , '' I said .
Parsing [sent. 344 len. 41]: `` I am the new vicar ; but I do not think that I should have come in to see you just to-day , if it had not been that your little boy there -- where is he gone to ?
Parsing [sent. 345 len. 12]: He asked me to come in and see his mother . ''
Parsing [sent. 346 len. 14]: `` He is too ready to make advances to strangers , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 347 len. 8]: She said this in an incisive tone .
Parsing [sent. 348 len. 18]: `` Oh , but , '' I answered , `` I am not a stranger to him .
Parsing [sent. 349 len. 7]: I have met him twice before .
Parsing [sent. 350 len. 6]: He is a little darling .
Parsing [sent. 351 len. 11]: I assure you he has quite gained my heart . ''
Parsing [sent. 352 len. 6]: No reply for a moment .
Parsing [sent. 353 len. 6]: Then just `` Indeed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 354 len. 4]: and nothing more .
Parsing [sent. 355 len. 6]: I could not understand it .
Parsing [sent. 356 len. 28]: But a jar on a shelf , marked TOBACCO , rescued me from the most pressing portion of the perplexity , namely , what to say next .
Parsing [sent. 357 len. 14]: `` Will you give me a quarter of a pound of tobacco ? ''
Parsing [sent. 358 len. 3]: I said .
Parsing [sent. 359 len. 59]: The woman turned , took down the jar , arranged the scales , weighed out the quantity , wrapped it up , took the money , -- and all without one other word than , `` Thank you , sir ; '' which was all I could return , with the addition of , `` Good morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 360 len. 16]: For nothing was left me but to walk away with my parcel in my pocket .
Parsing [sent. 361 len. 9]: The little boy did not show himself again .
Parsing [sent. 362 len. 8]: I had hoped to find him outside .
Parsing [sent. 363 len. 28]: Pondering , speculating , I now set out for the mill , which , I had already learned , was on the village side of the river .
Parsing [sent. 364 len. 47]: Coming to a lane leading down to the river , I followed it , and then walked up a path outside the row of pollards , through a lovely meadow , where brown and white cows were eating and shining all over the thick deep grass .
Parsing [sent. 365 len. 22]: Beyond the meadow , a wood on the side of a rising ground went parallel with the river a long way .
Parsing [sent. 366 len. 7]: The river flowed on my right .
Parsing [sent. 367 len. 25]: That is , I knew that it was flowing , but I could not have told how I knew , it was so slow .
Parsing [sent. 368 len. 51]: Still swollen , it was of a clear brown , in which you could see the browner trouts darting to and fro with such a slippery gliding , that the motion seemed the result of will , without any such intermediate and complicate arrangement as brain and nerves and muscles .
Parsing [sent. 369 len. 23]: The water-beetles went spinning about over the surface ; and one glorious dragon-fly made a mist about him with his long wings .
Parsing [sent. 370 len. 102]: And over all , the sun hung in the sky , pouring down life ; shining on the roots of the willows at the bottom of the stream ; lighting up the black head of the water-rat as he hurried across to the opposite bank ; glorifying the rich green lake of the grass ; and giving to the whole an utterance of love and hope and joy , which was , to him who could read it , a more certain and full revelation of God than any display of power in thunder , in avalanche , in stormy sea .
Parsing [sent. 371 len. 67]: Those with whom the feeling of religion is only occasional , have it most when the awful or grand breaks out of the common ; the meek who inherit the earth , find the God of the whole earth more evidently present -- I do not say more present , for there is no measuring of His presence -- more evidently present in the commonest things .
Parsing [sent. 372 len. 15]: That which is best He gives most plentifully , as is reason with Him .
Parsing [sent. 373 len. 17]: Hence the quiet fulness of ordinary nature ; hence the Spirit to them that ask it .
Parsing [sent. 374 len. 47]: I soon came within sound of the mill ; and presently , crossing the stream that flowed back to the river after having done its work on the corn , I came in front of the building , and looked over the half-door into the mill .
Parsing [sent. 375 len. 7]: The floor was clean and dusty .
Parsing [sent. 376 len. 29]: A few full sacks , tied tight at the mouth -- they always look to me as if Joseph 's silver cup were just inside -- stood about .
Parsing [sent. 377 len. 21]: In the farther corner , the flour was trickling down out of two wooden spouts into a wooden receptacle below .
Parsing [sent. 378 len. 13]: The whole place was full of its own faint but pleasant odour .
Parsing [sent. 379 len. 5]: No man was visible .
Parsing [sent. 380 len. 23]: The spouts went on pouring the slow torrent of flour , as if everything could go on with perfect propriety of itself .
Parsing [sent. 381 len. 32]: I could not even see how a man could get at the stones that I heard grinding away above , except he went up the rope that hung from the ceiling .
Parsing [sent. 382 len. 79]: So I walked round the corner of the place , and found myself in the company of the water-wheel , mossy and green with ancient waterdrops , looking so furred and overgrown and lumpy , that one might have thought the wood of it had taken to growing again in its old days , and so the wheel was losing by slow degrees the shape of a wheel , to become some new awful monster of a pollard .
Parsing [sent. 383 len. 56]: As yet , however , it was going round ; slowly , indeed , and with the gravity of age , but doing its work , and casting its loose drops in the alms-giving of a gentle rain upon a little plot of Master Rogers 's garden , which was therefore full of moisture-loving flowers .
Parsing [sent. 384 len. 26]: This plot was divided from the mill-wheel by a small stream which carried away the surplus water , and was now full and running rapidly .
Parsing [sent. 385 len. 29]: Beyond the stream , beside the flower bed , stood a dusty young man , talking to a young woman with a rosy face and clear honest eyes .
Parsing [sent. 386 len. 8]: The moment they saw me they parted .
Parsing [sent. 387 len. 23]: The young man came across the stream at a step , and the young woman went up the garden towards the cottage .
Parsing [sent. 388 len. 10]: `` That must be Old Rogers 's cottage ? ''
Parsing [sent. 389 len. 6]: I said to the miller .
Parsing [sent. 390 len. 14]: `` Yes , sir , '' he answered , looking a little sheepish .
Parsing [sent. 391 len. 16]: `` Was that his daughter -- that nice-looking young woman you were talking to ? ''
Parsing [sent. 392 len. 9]: `` Yes , sir , it was . ''
Parsing [sent. 393 len. 17]: And he stole a shy pleased look at me out of the corners of his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 394 len. 39]: `` It 's a good thing , '' I said , `` to have an honest experienced old mill like yours , that can manage to go on of itself for a little while now and then . ''
Parsing [sent. 395 len. 10]: This gave a great help to his budding confidence .
Parsing [sent. 396 len. 3]: He laughed .
Parsing [sent. 397 len. 16]: `` Well , sir , it 's not very often it 's left to itself .
Parsing [sent. 398 len. 17]: Jane is n't at her father 's above once or twice a week at most . ''
Parsing [sent. 399 len. 11]: `` She does n't live with them , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 400 len. 5]: `` No , sir .
Parsing [sent. 401 len. 26]: You see they 're both hearty , and they ai n't over well to do , and Jane lives up at the Hall , sir .
Parsing [sent. 402 len. 14]: She 's upper housemaid , and waits on one of the young ladies .
Parsing [sent. 403 len. 15]: -- Old Rogers has seen a great deal of the world , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 404 len. 5]: `` So I imagine .
Parsing [sent. 405 len. 8]: I am just going to see him .
Parsing [sent. 406 len. 4]: Good morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 407 len. 24]: I jumped across the stream , and went up a little gravel-walk , which led me in a few yards to the cottage-door .
Parsing [sent. 408 len. 33]: It was a sweet place to live in , with honeysuckle growing over the house , and the sounds of the softly-labouring mill-wheel ever in its little porch and about its windows .
Parsing [sent. 409 len. 15]: The door was open , and Dame Rogers came from within to meet me .
Parsing [sent. 410 len. 13]: She welcomed me , and led the way into her little kitchen .
Parsing [sent. 411 len. 11]: As I entered , Jane went out at the back-door .
Parsing [sent. 412 len. 14]: But it was only to call her father , who presently came in .
Parsing [sent. 413 len. 10]: `` I 'm glad to see ye , sir .
Parsing [sent. 414 len. 9]: This pleasure comes of having no work to-day .
Parsing [sent. 415 len. 12]: After harvest there comes slack times for the likes of me .
Parsing [sent. 416 len. 19]: People do n't care about a bag of old bones when they can get hold of young men .
Parsing [sent. 417 len. 10]: Well , well , never mind , old woman .
Parsing [sent. 418 len. 8]: The Lord 'll take us through somehow .
Parsing [sent. 419 len. 43]: When the wind blows , the ship goes ; when the wind drops , the ship stops ; but the sea is His all the same , for He made it ; and the wind is His all the same too . ''
Parsing [sent. 420 len. 17]: He spoke in the most matter-of-fact tone , unaware of anything poetic in what he said .
Parsing [sent. 421 len. 13]: To him it was just common sense , and common sense only .
Parsing [sent. 422 len. 14]: `` I am sorry you are out of work , '' I said .
Parsing [sent. 423 len. 19]: `` But my garden is sadly out of order , and I must have something done to it .
Parsing [sent. 424 len. 10]: You do n't dislike gardening , do you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 425 len. 31]: `` Well , I beant a right good hand at garden-work , '' answered the old man , with some embarrassment , scratching his gray head with a troubled scratch .
Parsing [sent. 426 len. 18]: There was more in this than met the ear ; but what , I could not conjecture .
Parsing [sent. 427 len. 8]: I would press the point a little .
Parsing [sent. 428 len. 9]: So I took him at his own word .
Parsing [sent. 429 len. 28]: `` I wo n't ask you to do any of the more ornamental part , '' I said , -- `` only plain digging and hoeing . ''
Parsing [sent. 430 len. 10]: `` I would rather be excused , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 431 len. 17]: `` I am afraid I made you think '' -- `` I thought nothing , sir .
Parsing [sent. 432 len. 8]: I thank you kindly , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 433 len. 25]: `` I assure you I want the work done , and I must employ some one else if you do n't undertake it . ''
Parsing [sent. 434 len. 24]: `` Well , sir , my back 's bad now -- no , sir , I wo n't tell a story about it .
Parsing [sent. 435 len. 9]: I would just rather not , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 436 len. 32]: `` Now , '' his wife broke in , `` now , Old Rogers , why wo n't ` ee tell the parson the truth , like a man , downright ?
Parsing [sent. 437 len. 13]: If ye wo n't , I 'll do it for ` ee .
Parsing [sent. 438 len. 88]: The fact is , sir , '' she went on , turning to me , with a plate in her hand , which she was wiping , `` the fact is , that the old parson 's man for that kind o ' work was Simmons , t ` other end of the village ; and my man is so afeard o ' hurtin ' e'er another , that he 'll turn the bread away from his own mouth and let it fall in the dirt . ''
Parsing [sent. 439 len. 16]: `` Now , now , old ` oman , do n't ` ee belie me .
Parsing [sent. 440 len. 8]: I 'm not so bad as that .
Parsing [sent. 441 len. 17]: You see , sir , I never was good at knowin ' right from wrong like .
Parsing [sent. 442 len. 18]: I never was good , that is , at tellin ' exactly what I ought to do .
Parsing [sent. 443 len. 32]: So when anything comes up , I just says to myself , ` Now , Old Rogers , what do you think the Lord would best like you to do ? '
Parsing [sent. 444 len. 34]: And as soon as I ax myself that , I know directly what I 've got to do ; and then my old woman ca n't turn me no more than a bull .
Parsing [sent. 445 len. 9]: And she do n't like my obstinate fits .
Parsing [sent. 446 len. 17]: But , you see , I dare n't sir , once I axed myself that . ''
Parsing [sent. 447 len. 11]: `` Stick to that , Rogers , '' I said .
Parsing [sent. 448 len. 19]: `` Besides , sir , '' he went on , `` Simmons wants it more than I do .
Parsing [sent. 449 len. 20]: He 's got a sick wife ; and my old woman , thank God , is hale and hearty .
Parsing [sent. 450 len. 61]: And there is another thing besides , sir : he might take it hard of you , sir , and think it was turning away an old servant like ; and then , sir , he would n't be ready to hear what you had to tell him , and might , mayhap , lose a deal o ' comfort .
Parsing [sent. 451 len. 12]: And that I would take worst of all , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 452 len. 14]: `` Well , well , Rogers , Simmons shall have the job . ''
Parsing [sent. 453 len. 12]: `` Thank ye , sir , '' said the old man .
Parsing [sent. 454 len. 35]: His wife , who could not see the thing quite from her husband 's point of view , was too honest to say anything ; but she was none the less cordial to me .
Parsing [sent. 455 len. 21]: The daughter stood looking from one to the other with attentive face , which took everything , but revealed nothing .
Parsing [sent. 456 len. 5]: I rose to go .
Parsing [sent. 457 len. 14]: As I reached the door , I remembered the tobacco in my pocket .
Parsing [sent. 458 len. 8]: I had not bought it for myself .
Parsing [sent. 459 len. 5]: I never could smoke .
Parsing [sent. 460 len. 57]: Nor do I conceive that smoking is essential to a clergyman in the country ; though I have occasionally envied one of my brethren in London , who will sit down by the fire , and , lighting his pipe , at the same time please his host and subdue the bad smells of the place .
Parsing [sent. 461 len. 14]: And I never could hit his way of talking to his parishioners either .
Parsing [sent. 462 len. 11]: He could put them at their ease in a moment .
Parsing [sent. 463 len. 13]: I think he must have got the trick out of his pipe .
Parsing [sent. 464 len. 19]: But in reality , I seldom think about how I ought to talk to anybody I am with .
Parsing [sent. 465 len. 19]: That I did n't smoke myself was no reason why I should not help Old Rogers to smoke .
Parsing [sent. 466 len. 7]: So I pulled out the tobacco .
Parsing [sent. 467 len. 11]: `` You smoke , do n't you , Rogers ? ''
Parsing [sent. 468 len. 3]: I said .
Parsing [sent. 469 len. 11]: `` Well , sir , I ca n't deny it .
Parsing [sent. 470 len. 11]: It 's not much I spend on baccay , anyhow .
Parsing [sent. 471 len. 5]: Is it , dame ?
Parsing [sent. 472 len. 13]: `` No , that it bea n't , '' answered his wife .
Parsing [sent. 473 len. 17]: `` You do n't think there 's any harm in smoking a pipe , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 474 len. 12]: `` Not the least , '' I answered , with emphasis .
Parsing [sent. 475 len. 46]: `` You see , sir , '' he went on , not giving me time to prove how far I was from thinking there was any harm in it ; `` You see , sir , sailors learns many ways they might be better without .
Parsing [sent. 476 len. 34]: I used to take my pan o ' grog with the rest of them ; but I give that up quite , 'cause as how I do n't want it now . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 477 len. 21]: 'Cause as how , '' interrupted his wife , `` you spend the money on tea for me , instead .
Parsing [sent. 478 len. 9]: You wicked old man to tell stories ! ''
Parsing [sent. 479 len. 26]: `` Well , I takes my share of the tea , old woman , and I 'm sure it 's a deal better for me .
Parsing [sent. 480 len. 32]: But , to tell the truth , sir , I was a little troubled in my mind about the baccay , not knowing whether I ought to have it or not .
Parsing [sent. 481 len. 39]: For you see , the parson that 's gone did n't more than half like it , as I could tell by the turn of his hawse-holes when he came in at the door and me a-smokin ' .
Parsing [sent. 482 len. 25]: Not as he said anything ; for , ye see , I was an old man , and I daresay that kep him quiet .
Parsing [sent. 483 len. 25]: But I did hear him blow up a young chap i ' the village he come upon promiscus with a pipe in his mouth .
Parsing [sent. 484 len. 13]: He did give him a thunderin ' broadside , to be sure !
Parsing [sent. 485 len. 19]: So I was in two minds whether I ought to go on with my pipe or not . ''
Parsing [sent. 486 len. 12]: `` And how did you settle the question , Rogers ? ''
Parsing [sent. 487 len. 13]: `` Why , I followed my own old chart , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 488 len. 4]: `` Quite right .
Parsing [sent. 489 len. 12]: One must n't mind too much what other people think . ''
Parsing [sent. 490 len. 12]: `` That 's not exactly what I mean , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 491 len. 7]: `` What do you mean then ?
Parsing [sent. 492 len. 7]: I should like to know . ''
Parsing [sent. 493 len. 35]: `` Well , sir , I mean that I said to myself , ` Now , Old Rogers , what do you think the Lord would say about this here baccay business ? '' '
Parsing [sent. 494 len. 11]: `` And what did you think He would say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 495 len. 34]: `` Why , sir , I thought He would say , ` Old Rogers , have yer baccay ; only mind ye do n't grumble when you ` aint got none . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 496 len. 22]: Something in this -- I could not at the time have told what -- touched me more than I can express .
Parsing [sent. 497 len. 36]: No doubt it was the simple reality of the relation in which the old man stood to his Father in heaven that made me feel as if the tears would come in spite of me .
Parsing [sent. 498 len. 24]: `` And this is the man , '' I said to myself , `` whom I thought I should be able to teach !
Parsing [sent. 499 len. 18]: Well , the wisest learn most , and I may be useful to him after all . ''
Parsing [sent. 500 len. 51]: As I said nothing , the old man resumed -- `` For you see , sir , it is not always a body feels he has a right to spend his ha ` pence on baccay ; and sometimes , too , he ` aint got none to spend . ''
Parsing [sent. 501 len. 23]: `` In the meantime , '' I said , `` here is some that I bought for you as I came along .
Parsing [sent. 502 len. 8]: I hope you will find it good .
Parsing [sent. 503 len. 6]: I am no judge . ''
Parsing [sent. 504 len. 9]: The old sailor 's eyes glistened with gratitude .
Parsing [sent. 505 len. 10]: `` Well , who 'd ha ' thought it .
Parsing [sent. 506 len. 16]: You did n't think I was beggin ' for it , sir , surely ? ''
Parsing [sent. 507 len. 13]: `` You see I had it for you in my pocket . ''
Parsing [sent. 508 len. 13]: `` Well , that IS good o ' you , sir ! ''
Parsing [sent. 509 len. 13]: `` Why , Rogers , that 'll last you a month ! ''
Parsing [sent. 510 len. 11]: exclaimed his wife , looking nearly as pleased as himself .
Parsing [sent. 511 len. 12]: `` Six weeks at least , wife , '' he answered .
Parsing [sent. 512 len. 18]: `` And ye do n't smoke yourself , sir , and yet ye bring baccay to me !
Parsing [sent. 513 len. 12]: Well , it 's just like yer Master , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 514 len. 27]: I went away , resolved that Old Rogers should have no chance of `` grumbling '' for want of tobacco , if I could help it .
Parsing [sent. 515 len. 3]: CHAPTER IV .
Parsing [sent. 516 len. 3]: THE COFFIN .
Parsing [sent. 517 len. 21]: On the way back , my thoughts were still occupied with the woman I had seen in the little shop .
Parsing [sent. 518 len. 32]: The old man-of-war 's man was probably the nobler being of the two ; and if I had had to choose between them , I should no doubt have chosen him .
Parsing [sent. 519 len. 38]: But I had not to choose between them ; I had only to think about them ; and I thought a great deal more about the one I could not understand than the one I could understand .
Parsing [sent. 520 len. 57]: For Old Rogers wanted little help from me ; whereas the other was evidently a soul in pain , and therefore belonged to me in peculiar right of my office ; while the readiest way in which I could justify to myself the possession of that office was to make it a shepherding of the sheep .
Parsing [sent. 521 len. 31]: So I resolved to find out what I could about her , as one having a right to know , that I might see whether I could not help her .
Parsing [sent. 522 len. 42]: From herself it was evident that her secret , if she had one , was not to be easily gained ; but even the common reports of the village would be some enlightenment to the darkness I was in about her .
Parsing [sent. 523 len. 27]: As I went again through the village , I observed a narrow lane striking off to the left , and resolved to explore in that direction .
Parsing [sent. 524 len. 17]: It led up to one side of the large house of which I have already spoken .
Parsing [sent. 525 len. 28]: As I came near , I smelt what has been to me always a delightful smell -- that of fresh deals under the hands of the carpenter .
Parsing [sent. 526 len. 27]: In the scent of those boards of pine is enclosed all the idea the tree could gather of the world of forest where it was reared .
Parsing [sent. 527 len. 15]: It speaks of many wild and bright but chiefly clean and rather cold things .
Parsing [sent. 528 len. 15]: If I were idling , it would draw me to it across many fields .
Parsing [sent. 529 len. 13]: -- Turning a corner , I heard the sound of a saw .
Parsing [sent. 530 len. 8]: And this sound drew me yet more .
Parsing [sent. 531 len. 139]: For a carpenter 's shop was the delight of my boyhood ; and after I began to read the history of our Lord with something of that sense of reality with which we read other histories , and which , I am sorry to think , so much of the well-meant instruction we receive in our youth tends to destroy , my feeling about such a workshop grew stronger and stronger , till at last I never could go near enough to see the shavings lying on the floor of one , without a spiritual sensation such as I have in entering an old church ; which sensation , ever since having been admitted on the usual conditions to a Mohammedan mosque , urges me to pull off , not only my hat , but my shoes likewise .
Parsing [sent. 532 len. 39]: And the feeling has grown upon me , till now it seems at times as if the only cure in the world for social pride would be to go for five silent minutes into a carpenter 's shop .
Parsing [sent. 533 len. 44]: How one can think of himself as above his neighbours , within sight , sound , or smell of one , I fear I am getting almost unable to imagine , and one ought not to get out of sympathy with the wrong .
Parsing [sent. 534 len. 26]: Only as I am growing old now , it does not matter so much , for I daresay my time will not be very long .
Parsing [sent. 535 len. 24]: So I drew near to the shop , feeling as if the Lord might be at work there at one of the benches .
Parsing [sent. 536 len. 24]: And when I reached the door , there was my pale-faced hearer of the Sunday afternoon , sawing a board for a coffin-lid .
Parsing [sent. 537 len. 18]: As my shadow fell across and darkened his work , he lifted his head and saw me .
Parsing [sent. 538 len. 31]: I could not altogether understand the expression of his countenance as he stood upright from his labour and touched his old hat with rather a proud than a courteous gesture .
Parsing [sent. 539 len. 25]: And I could not believe that he was glad to see me , although he laid down his saw and advanced to the door .
Parsing [sent. 540 len. 29]: It was the gentleman in him , not the man , that sought to make me welcome , hardly caring whether I saw through the ceremony or not .
Parsing [sent. 541 len. 56]: True , there was a smile on his lips , but the smile of a man who cherishes a secret grudge ; of one who does not altogether dislike you , but who has a claim upon you -- say , for an apology , of which claim he doubts whether you know the existence .
Parsing [sent. 542 len. 28]: So the smile seemed tightened , and stopped just when it got half-way to its width , and was about to become hearty and begin to shine .
Parsing [sent. 543 len. 7]: `` May I come in ? ''
Parsing [sent. 544 len. 3]: I said .
Parsing [sent. 545 len. 10]: `` Come in , sir , '' he answered .
Parsing [sent. 546 len. 18]: `` I am glad I have happened to come upon you by accident , '' I said .
Parsing [sent. 547 len. 29]: He smiled as if he did not quite believe in the accident , and considered it a part of the play between us that I should pretend it .
Parsing [sent. 548 len. 34]: I hastened to add -- `` I was wandering about the place , making some acquaintance with it , and with my friends in it , when I came upon you quite unexpectedly .
Parsing [sent. 549 len. 12]: You know I saw you in church on Sunday afternoon . ''
Parsing [sent. 550 len. 42]: `` I know you saw me , sir , '' he answered , with a motion as if to return to his work ; `` but , to tell the truth , I do n't go to church very often . ''
Parsing [sent. 551 len. 35]: I did not quite know whether to take this as proceeding from an honest fear of being misunderstood , or from a sense of being in general superior to all that sort of thing .
Parsing [sent. 552 len. 16]: But I felt that it would be of no good to pursue the inquiry directly .
Parsing [sent. 553 len. 8]: I looked therefore for something to say .
Parsing [sent. 554 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 555 len. 48]: your work is not always a pleasant one , '' I said , associating the feelings of which I have already spoken with the facts before me , and looking at the coffin , the lower part of which stood nearly finished upon trestles on the floor .
Parsing [sent. 556 len. 15]: `` Well , there are unpleasant things in all trades , '' he answered .
Parsing [sent. 557 len. 20]: `` But it does not matter , '' he added , with an increase of bitterness in his smile .
Parsing [sent. 558 len. 20]: `` I did n't mean , '' I said , `` that the work was unpleasant -- only sad .
Parsing [sent. 559 len. 11]: It must always be painful to make a coffin . ''
Parsing [sent. 560 len. 18]: `` A joiner gets used to it , sir , as you do to the funeral service .
Parsing [sent. 561 len. 24]: But , for my part , I do n't see why it should be considered so unhappy for a man to be buried .
Parsing [sent. 562 len. 21]: This is n't such a good job , after all , this world , sir , you must allow . ''
Parsing [sent. 563 len. 17]: `` Neither is that coffin , '' said I , as if by a sudden inspiration .
Parsing [sent. 564 len. 13]: The man seemed taken aback , as Old Rogers might have said .
Parsing [sent. 565 len. 11]: He looked at the coffin and then looked at me .
Parsing [sent. 566 len. 46]: `` Well , sir , '' he said , after a short pause , which no doubt seemed longer both to him and to me than it would have seemed to any third person , `` I do n't see anything amiss with the coffin .
Parsing [sent. 567 len. 45]: I do n't say it 'll last till doomsday , as the gravedigger says to Hamlet , because I do n't know so much about doomsday as some people pretend to ; but you see , sir , it 's not finished yet . ''
Parsing [sent. 568 len. 16]: `` Thank you , '' I said ; `` that 's just what I meant .
Parsing [sent. 569 len. 27]: You thought I was hasty in my judgment of your coffin ; whereas I only said of it knowingly what you said of the world thoughtlessly .
Parsing [sent. 570 len. 14]: How do you know that the world is finished anymore than your coffin ?
Parsing [sent. 571 len. 14]: And how dare you then say that it is a bad job ? ''
Parsing [sent. 572 len. 19]: The same respectfully scornful smile passed over his face , as much as to say , `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 573 len. 20]: it 's your trade to talk that way , so I must not be too hard upon you . ''
Parsing [sent. 574 len. 37]: `` At any rate , sir , '' he said , `` whoever made it has taken long enough about it , a person would think , to finish anything he ever meant to finish . ''
Parsing [sent. 575 len. 24]: `` One day is with the Lord as a thousand years , and a thousand years as one day , '' I said .
Parsing [sent. 576 len. 18]: `` That 's supposing , '' he answered , `` that the Lord did make the world .
Parsing [sent. 577 len. 21]: For my part , I am half of a mind that the Lord did n't make it at all . ''
Parsing [sent. 578 len. 15]: `` I am very glad to hear you say so , '' I answered .
Parsing [sent. 579 len. 11]: Hereupon I found that we had changed places a little .
Parsing [sent. 580 len. 6]: He looked up at me .
Parsing [sent. 581 len. 28]: The smile of superiority was no longer there , and a puzzled questioning , which might indicate either `` Who would have expected that from you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 582 len. 9]: or , `` What can he mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 583 len. 10]: or both at once , had taken its place .
Parsing [sent. 584 len. 25]: I , for my part , knew that on the scale of the man 's judgment I had risen nearer to his own level .
Parsing [sent. 585 len. 21]: As he said nothing , however , and I was in danger of being misunderstood , I proceeded at once .
Parsing [sent. 586 len. 32]: `` Of course it seems to me better that you should not believe God had done a thing , than that you should believe He had not done it well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 587 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 588 len. 5]: I see , sir .
Parsing [sent. 589 len. 19]: Then you will allow there is some room for doubting whether He made the world at all ? ''
Parsing [sent. 590 len. 30]: `` Yes ; for I do not think an honest man , as you seem to me to be , would be able to doubt without any room whatever .
Parsing [sent. 591 len. 8]: That would be only for a fool .
Parsing [sent. 592 len. 24]: But it is just possible , as we are not perfectly good ourselves -- you 'll allow that , wo n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 593 len. 11]: `` That I will , sir ; God knows . ''
Parsing [sent. 594 len. 37]: `` Well , I say -- as we 're not quite good ourselves , it 's just possible that things may be too good for us to do them the justice of believing in them . ''
Parsing [sent. 595 len. 15]: `` But there are things , you must allow , so plainly wrong ! ''
Parsing [sent. 596 len. 42]: `` So much so , both in the world and in myself , that it would be to me torturing despair to believe that God did not make the world ; for then , how would it ever be put right ?
Parsing [sent. 597 len. 15]: Therefore I prefer the theory that He has not done making it yet . ''
Parsing [sent. 598 len. 28]: `` But would n't you say , sir , that God might have managed it without so many slips in the making as your way would suppose ?
Parsing [sent. 599 len. 15]: I should think myself a bad workman if I worked after that fashion . ''
Parsing [sent. 600 len. 11]: `` I do not believe that there are any slips .
Parsing [sent. 601 len. 23]: You know you are making a coffin ; but are you sure you know what God is making of the world ? ''
Parsing [sent. 602 len. 15]: `` That I ca n't tell , of course , nor anybody else . ''
Parsing [sent. 603 len. 26]: `` Then you ca n't say that what looks like a slip is really a slip , either in the design or in the workmanship .
Parsing [sent. 604 len. 31]: You do not know what end He has in view ; and you may find some day that those slips were just the straight road to that very end . ''
Parsing [sent. 605 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 606 len. 2]: maybe .
Parsing [sent. 607 len. 13]: But you ca n't be sure of it , you see . ''
Parsing [sent. 608 len. 39]: `` Perhaps not , in the way you mean ; but sure enough , for all that , to try it upon life -- to order my way by it , and so find that it works well .
Parsing [sent. 609 len. 12]: And I find that it explains everything that comes near it .
Parsing [sent. 610 len. 27]: You know that no engineer would be satisfied with his engine on paper , nor with any proof whatever except seeing how it will go . ''
Parsing [sent. 611 len. 5]: He made no reply .
Parsing [sent. 612 len. 14]: It is a principle of mine never to push anything over the edge .
Parsing [sent. 613 len. 18]: When I am successful , in any argument , my one dread is of humiliating my opponent .
Parsing [sent. 614 len. 7]: Indeed I can not bear it .
Parsing [sent. 615 len. 4]: It humiliates me .
Parsing [sent. 616 len. 39]: And if you want him to think about anything , you must leave him room , and not give him such associations with the question that the very idea of it will be painful and irritating to him .
Parsing [sent. 617 len. 11]: Let him have a hand in the convincing of himself .
Parsing [sent. 618 len. 29]: I have been surprised sometimes to see my own arguments come up fresh and green , when I thought the fowls of the air had devoured them up .
Parsing [sent. 619 len. 41]: When a man reasons for victory and not for the truth in the other soul , he is sure of just one ally , the same that Faust had in fighting Gretchen 's brother -- that is , the Devil .
Parsing [sent. 620 len. 9]: But God and good men are against him .
Parsing [sent. 621 len. 42]: So I never follow up a victory of that kind , for , as I said , the defeat of the intellect is not the object in fighting with the sword of the Spirit , but the acceptance of the heart .
Parsing [sent. 622 len. 10]: In this case , therefore , I drew back .
Parsing [sent. 623 len. 13]: `` May I ask for whom you are making that coffin ? ''
Parsing [sent. 624 len. 11]: `` For a sister of my own , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 625 len. 9]: `` I 'm sorry to hear that . ''
Parsing [sent. 626 len. 6]: `` There 's no occasion .
Parsing [sent. 627 len. 21]: I ca n't say I 'm sorry , though she was one of the best women I ever knew . ''
Parsing [sent. 628 len. 9]: `` Why are you not sorry , then ?
Parsing [sent. 629 len. 14]: Life 's a good thing in the main , you will allow . ''
Parsing [sent. 630 len. 10]: `` Yes , when it 's endurable at all .
Parsing [sent. 631 len. 58]: But to have a brute of a husband coming home at any hour of the night or morning , drunk upon the money she had earned by hard work , was enough to take more of the shine out of things than church-going on Sundays could put in again , regular as she was , poor woman !
Parsing [sent. 632 len. 22]: I 'm as glad as her brute of a husband , that she 's out of his way at last . ''
Parsing [sent. 633 len. 12]: `` How do you know he 's glad of it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 634 len. 12]: `` He 's been drunk every night since she died . ''
Parsing [sent. 635 len. 11]: `` Then he 's the worse for losing her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 636 len. 6]: `` He may well be .
Parsing [sent. 637 len. 13]: Crying like a hypocrite , too , over his own work ! ''
Parsing [sent. 638 len. 7]: `` A fool he must be .
Parsing [sent. 639 len. 6]: A hypocrite , perhaps not .
Parsing [sent. 640 len. 9]: A hypocrite is a terrible name to give .
Parsing [sent. 641 len. 9]: Perhaps her death will do him good . ''
Parsing [sent. 642 len. 12]: `` He does n't deserve to be done any good to .
Parsing [sent. 643 len. 15]: I would have made this coffin for him with a world of pleasure . ''
Parsing [sent. 644 len. 14]: `` I never found that I deserved anything , not even a coffin .
Parsing [sent. 645 len. 22]: The only claim that I could ever lay to anything was that I was very much in want of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 646 len. 22]: The old smile returned -- as much as to say , `` That 's your little game in the church . ''
Parsing [sent. 647 len. 62]: But I resolved to try nothing more with him at present ; and indeed was sorry that I had started the new question at all , partly because thus I had again given him occasion to feel that he knew better than I did , which was not good either for him or for me in our relation to each other .
Parsing [sent. 648 len. 19]: `` This has been a fine old room once , '' I said , looking round the workshop .
Parsing [sent. 649 len. 13]: `` You can see it was n't a workshop always , sir .
Parsing [sent. 650 len. 17]: Many a grand dinner-party has sat down in this room when it was in its glory .
Parsing [sent. 651 len. 7]: Look at the chimney-piece there . ''
Parsing [sent. 652 len. 15]: `` I have been looking at it , '' I said , going nearer .
Parsing [sent. 653 len. 14]: `` It represents the four quarters of the world , you see . ''
Parsing [sent. 654 len. 62]: I saw strange figures of men and women , one on a kneeling camel , one on a crawling crocodile , and others differently mounted ; with various besides of Nature 's bizarre productions creeping and flying in stone-carving over the huge fire-place , in which , in place of a fire , stood several new and therefore brilliantly red cart-wheels .
Parsing [sent. 655 len. 51]: The sun shone through the upper part of a high window , of which many of the panes were broken , right in upon the cart-wheels , which , glowing thus in the chimney under the sombre chimney-piece , added to the grotesque look of the whole assemblage of contrasts .
Parsing [sent. 656 len. 31]: The coffin and the carpenter stood in the twilight occasioned by the sharp division of light made by a lofty wing of the house that rose flanking the other window .
Parsing [sent. 657 len. 32]: The room was still wainscotted in panels , which , I presume , for the sake of the more light required for handicraft , had been washed all over with white .
Parsing [sent. 658 len. 12]: At the level of labour they were broken in many places .
Parsing [sent. 659 len. 16]: Somehow or other , the whole reminded me of Albert Durer 's `` Melencholia . ''
Parsing [sent. 660 len. 43]: Seeing I was interested in looking about his shop , my new friend -- for I could not help feeling that we should be friends before all was over , and so began to count him one already -- resumed the conversation .
Parsing [sent. 661 len. 12]: He had never taken up the dropped thread of it before .
Parsing [sent. 662 len. 45]: `` Yes , sir , '' he said ; `` the owners of the place little thought it would come to this -- the deals growing into a coffin there on the spot where the grand dinner was laid for them and their guests !
Parsing [sent. 663 len. 32]: But there is another thing about it that is odder still ; my son is the last male '' -- Here he stopped suddenly , and his face grew very red .
Parsing [sent. 664 len. 21]: As suddenly he resumed -- `` I 'm not a gentleman , sir ; but I will tell the truth .
Parsing [sent. 665 len. 3]: Curse it !
Parsing [sent. 666 len. 31]: -- I beg your pardon , sir , '' -- and here the old smile -- `` I do n't think I got that from THEIR side of the house .
Parsing [sent. 667 len. 11]: -- My son 's NOT the last male descendant . ''
Parsing [sent. 668 len. 5]: Here followed another pause .
Parsing [sent. 669 len. 33]: As to the imprecation , I knew better than to take any notice of a mere expression of excitement under a sense of some injury with which I was not yet acquainted .
Parsing [sent. 670 len. 45]: If I could get his feelings right in regard to other and more important things , a reform in that matter would soon follow ; whereas to make a mountain of a molehill would be to put that very mountain between him and me .
Parsing [sent. 671 len. 38]: Nor would I ask him any questions , lest I should just happen to ask him the wrong one ; for this parishioner of mine evidently wanted careful handling , if I would do him any good .
Parsing [sent. 672 len. 17]: And it will not do any man good to fling even the Bible in his face .
Parsing [sent. 673 len. 29]: Nay , a roll of bank-notes , which would be more evidently a good to most men , would carry insult with it if presented in that manner .
Parsing [sent. 674 len. 22]: You can not expect people to accept before they have had a chance of seeing what the offered gift really is .
Parsing [sent. 675 len. 20]: After a pause , therefore , the carpenter had once more to recommence , or let the conversation lie .
Parsing [sent. 676 len. 7]: I stood in a waiting attitude .
Parsing [sent. 677 len. 42]: And while I looked at him , I was reminded of some one else whom I knew -- with whom , too , I had pleasant associations -- though I could not in the least determine who that one might be .
Parsing [sent. 678 len. 18]: `` It 's very foolish of me to talk so to a stranger , '' he resumed .
Parsing [sent. 679 len. 21]: `` It is very kind and friendly of you , '' I said , still careful to make no advances .
Parsing [sent. 680 len. 18]: `` And you yourself belong to the old family that once lived in this old house ? ''
Parsing [sent. 681 len. 27]: `` It would be no boast to tell the truth , sir , even if it were a credit to me , which it is not .
Parsing [sent. 682 len. 12]: That family has been nothing but a curse to ours . ''
Parsing [sent. 683 len. 22]: I noted that he spoke of that family as different from his , and yet implied that he belonged to it .
Parsing [sent. 684 len. 7]: The explanation would come in time .
Parsing [sent. 685 len. 19]: But the man was again silent , planing away at half the lid of his sister 's coffin .
Parsing [sent. 686 len. 19]: And I could not help thinking that the closed mouth meant to utter nothing more on this occasion .
Parsing [sent. 687 len. 40]: `` I am sure there must be many a story to tell about this old place , if only there were any one to tell them , '' I said at last , looking round the room once more .
Parsing [sent. 688 len. 15]: -- `` I think I see the remains of paintings on the ceiling . ''
Parsing [sent. 689 len. 7]: `` You are sharp-eyed , sir .
Parsing [sent. 690 len. 13]: My father says they were plain enough in his young days . ''
Parsing [sent. 691 len. 9]: `` Is your father alive , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 692 len. 20]: `` That he is , sir , and hearty too , though he seldom goes out of doors now .
Parsing [sent. 693 len. 9]: Will you go up stairs and see him ?
Parsing [sent. 694 len. 7]: He 's past ninety , sir .
Parsing [sent. 695 len. 22]: He has plenty of stories to tell about the old place -- before it began to fall to pieces like . ''
Parsing [sent. 696 len. 49]: `` I wo n't go to-day , '' I said , partly because I wanted to be at home to receive any one who might call , and partly to secure an excuse for calling again upon the carpenter sooner than I should otherwise have liked to do .
Parsing [sent. 697 len. 15]: `` I expect visitors myself , and it is time I were at home .
Parsing [sent. 698 len. 4]: Good morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 699 len. 7]: `` Good morning , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 700 len. 13]: And away home I went with a new wonder in my brain .
Parsing [sent. 701 len. 9]: The man did not seem unknown to me .
Parsing [sent. 702 len. 16]: I mean , the state of his mind woke no feeling of perplexity in me .
Parsing [sent. 703 len. 63]: I was certain of understanding it thoroughly when I had learned something of his history ; for that such a man must have a history of his own was rendered only the more probable from the fact that he knew something of the history of his forefathers , though , indeed , there are some men who seem to have no other .
Parsing [sent. 704 len. 36]: It was strange , however , to think of that man working away at a trade in the very house in which such ancestors had eaten and drunk , and married and given in marriage .
Parsing [sent. 705 len. 39]: The house and family had declined together -- in outward appearance at least ; for it was quite possible both might have risen in the moral and spiritual scale in proportion as they sank in the social one .
Parsing [sent. 706 len. 49]: And if any of my readers are at first inclined to think that this could hardly be , seeing that the man was little , if anything , better than an infidel , I would just like to hold one minute 's conversation with them on that subject .
Parsing [sent. 707 len. 18]: A man may be on the way to the truth , just in virtue of his doubting .
Parsing [sent. 708 len. 59]: I will tell you what Lord Bacon says , and of all writers of English I delight in him : `` So it is in contemplation : if a man will begin with certainties , he shall end in doubts ; but if he will be content to begin with doubts , he shall end in certainties . ''
Parsing [sent. 709 len. 33]: Now I could not tell the kind or character of this man 's doubt ; but it was evidently real and not affected doubt ; and that was much in his favour .
Parsing [sent. 710 len. 71]: And I couid see that he was a thinking man ; just one of the sort I thought I should get on with in time , because he was honest -- notwithstanding that unpleasant smile of his , which did irritate me a little , and partly piqued me into the determination to get the better of the man , if I possibly could , by making friends with him .
Parsing [sent. 711 len. 10]: At all events , here was another strange parishioner .
Parsing [sent. 712 len. 10]: And who could it be that he was like ?
Parsing [sent. 713 len. 7]: CHAPTER V. VISITORS FROM THE HALL .
Parsing [sent. 714 len. 41]: When I came near my own gate , I saw that it was open ; and when I came in sight of my own door , I found a carriage standing before it , and a footman ringing the bell .
Parsing [sent. 715 len. 21]: It was an old-fashioned carriage , with two white horses in it , yet whiter by age than by nature .
Parsing [sent. 716 len. 25]: They looked as if no coachman could get more than three miles an hour out of them , they were so fat and knuckle-kneed .
Parsing [sent. 717 len. 25]: But my attention could not rest long on the horses , and I reached the door just as my housekeeper was pronouncing me absent .
Parsing [sent. 718 len. 14]: There were two ladies in the carriage , one old and one young .
Parsing [sent. 719 len. 9]: `` Ah , here is Mr. Walton ! ''
Parsing [sent. 720 len. 29]: said the old lady , in a serene voice , with a clear hardness in its tone ; and I held out my hand to aid her descent .
Parsing [sent. 721 len. 46]: She had pulled off her glove to get a card out of her card-case , and so put the tips of two old fingers , worn very smooth , as if polished with feeling what things were like , upon the palm of my hand .
Parsing [sent. 722 len. 32]: I then offered my hand to her companion , a girl apparently about fourteen , who took a hearty hold of it , and jumped down beside her with a smile .
Parsing [sent. 723 len. 27]: As I followed them into the house , I took their card from the housekeeper 's hand , and read , Mrs Oldcastle and Miss Gladwyn .
Parsing [sent. 724 len. 20]: I confess here to my reader , that these are not really the names I read on the card .
Parsing [sent. 725 len. 7]: I made these up this minute .
Parsing [sent. 726 len. 17]: But the names of the persons of humble position in my story are their real names .
Parsing [sent. 727 len. 12]: And my reason for making the difference will be plain enough .
Parsing [sent. 728 len. 29]: You can never find out my friend Old Rogers ; you might find out the people who called on me in their carriage with the ancient white horses .
Parsing [sent. 729 len. 26]: When they were seated in the drawing-room , I said to the old lady -- `` I remember seeing you in church on Sunday morning .
Parsing [sent. 730 len. 12]: It is very kind of you to call so soon . ''
Parsing [sent. 731 len. 63]: `` You will always see me in church , '' she returned , with a stiff bow , and an expansion of deadness on her face , which I interpreted into an assertion of dignity , resulting from the implied possibility that I might have passed her over in my congregation , or might have forgotten her after not passing her over .
Parsing [sent. 732 len. 29]: `` Except when you have a headache , grannie , '' said Miss Gladwyn , with an arch look first at her grandmother , and then at me .
Parsing [sent. 733 len. 8]: `` Grannie has bad headaches sometimes . ''
Parsing [sent. 734 len. 30]: The deadness melted a little from Mrs Oldcastle 's face , as she turned with half a smile to her grandchild , and said -- `` Yes , Pet .
Parsing [sent. 735 len. 15]: But you know that can not be an interesting fact to Mr. Walton . ''
Parsing [sent. 736 len. 13]: `` I beg your pardon , Mrs. Oldcastle , '' I said .
Parsing [sent. 737 len. 21]: `` A clergyman ought to know something , and the more the better , of the troubles of his flock .
Parsing [sent. 738 len. 23]: Sympathy is one of the first demands he ought to be able to meet -- I know what a headache is . ''
Parsing [sent. 739 len. 17]: The former expression , or rather non-expression , returned ; this time unaccompanied by a bow .
Parsing [sent. 740 len. 18]: `` I trust , Mr. Walton , I TRUST I am above any morbid necessity for sympathy .
Parsing [sent. 741 len. 28]: But , as you say , amongst the poor of your flock , -- it IS very desirable that a clergyman should be able to sympathise . ''
Parsing [sent. 742 len. 19]: `` It 's quite true what grannie says , Mr. Walton , though you might n't think it .
Parsing [sent. 743 len. 47]: When she has a headache , she shuts herself up in her own room , and does n't even let me come near her -- nobody but Sarah ; and how she can prefer her to me , I 'm sure I do n't know . ''
Parsing [sent. 744 len. 18]: And here the girl pretended to pout , but with a sparkle in her bright gray eye .
Parsing [sent. 745 len. 11]: `` The subject is not interesting to me , Pet .
Parsing [sent. 746 len. 22]: Pray , Mr. Walton , is it a point of conscience with you to wear the surplice when you preach ? ''
Parsing [sent. 747 len. 10]: `` Not in the least , '' I answered .
Parsing [sent. 748 len. 12]: `` I think I like it rather better on the whole .
Parsing [sent. 749 len. 10]: But that 's not why I wear it . ''
Parsing [sent. 750 len. 8]: `` Never mind grannie , Mr. Walton .
Parsing [sent. 751 len. 9]: _ I _ think the surplice is lovely .
Parsing [sent. 752 len. 38]: I 'm sure it 's much liker the way we shall be dressed in heaven , though I do n't think I shall ever get there , if I must read the good books grannie reads . ''
Parsing [sent. 753 len. 23]: `` I do n't know that it is necessary to read any good books but the good book , '' I said .
Parsing [sent. 754 len. 6]: `` There , grannie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 755 len. 6]: exclaimed Miss Gladwyn , triumphantly .
Parsing [sent. 756 len. 15]: `` I 'm so glad I 've got Mr Walton on my side ! ''
Parsing [sent. 757 len. 22]: `` Mr Walton is not so old as I am , my dear , and has much to learn yet . ''
Parsing [sent. 758 len. 52]: I could not help feeling a little annoyed , -LRB- which was very foolish , I know , -RRB- and saying to myself , `` If it 's to make me like you , I had rather not learn any more ; '' but I said nothing aloud , of course .
Parsing [sent. 759 len. 11]: `` Have you got a headache to-day , grannie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 760 len. 5]: `` No , Pet .
Parsing [sent. 761 len. 3]: Be quiet .
Parsing [sent. 762 len. 13]: I wish to ask Mr Walton WHY he wears the surplice . ''
Parsing [sent. 763 len. 24]: `` Simply , '' I replied , `` because I was told the people had been accustomed to it under my predecessor . ''
Parsing [sent. 764 len. 24]: `` But that can be no good reason for doing what is not right -- that people have been accustomed to it . ''
Parsing [sent. 765 len. 12]: `` But I do n't allow that it 's not right .
Parsing [sent. 766 len. 11]: I think it is a matter of no consequence whatever .
Parsing [sent. 767 len. 20]: If I find that the people do n't like it , I will give it up with pleasure . ''
Parsing [sent. 768 len. 14]: `` You ought to have principles of your own , Mr Walton . ''
Parsing [sent. 769 len. 6]: `` I hope I have .
Parsing [sent. 770 len. 21]: And one of them is , not to make mountains of molehills ; for a molehill is not a mountain .
Parsing [sent. 771 len. 51]: A man ought to have too much to do in obeying his conscience and keeping his soul 's garments clean , to mind whether he wears black or white when telling his flock that God loves them , and that they will never be happy till they believe it . ''
Parsing [sent. 772 len. 9]: `` They may believe that too soon . ''
Parsing [sent. 773 len. 15]: `` I do n't think any one can believe the truth too soon . ''
Parsing [sent. 774 len. 27]: A pause followed , during which it became evident to me that Miss Gladwyn saw fun in the whole affair , and was enjoying it thoroughly .
Parsing [sent. 775 len. 12]: Mrs Oldcastle 's face , on the contrary , was illegible .
Parsing [sent. 776 len. 41]: She resumed in a measured still voice , which she meant to be meek , I daresay , but which was really authoritative -- `` I am sorry , Mr Walton , that your principles are so loose and unsettled .
Parsing [sent. 777 len. 45]: You will see my honesty in saying so when you find that , objecting to the surplice , as I do , on Protestant grounds , I yet warn you against making any change because you may discover that your parishioners are against it .
Parsing [sent. 778 len. 24]: You have no idea , Mr Walton , what inroads Radicalism , as they call it , has been making in this neighbourhood .
Parsing [sent. 779 len. 5]: It is quite dreadful .
Parsing [sent. 780 len. 21]: Everybody , down to the poorest , claiming a right to think for himself , and set his betters right !
Parsing [sent. 781 len. 55]: There 's one worse than any of the rest -- but he 's no better than an atheist -- a carpenter of the name of Weir , always talking to his neighbours against the proprietors and the magistrates , and the clergy too , Mr Walton , and the game-laws ; and what not ?
Parsing [sent. 782 len. 52]: And if you once show them that you are afraid of them by going a step out of your way for THEIR opinion about anything , there will be no end to it ; for , the beginning of strife is like the letting out of water , as you know .
Parsing [sent. 783 len. 71]: _ I _ should know nothing about it , but that , my daughter 's maid -- I came to hear of it through her -- a decent girl of the name of Rogers , and born of decent parents , but unfortunately attached to the son of one of your churchwardens , who has put him into that mill on the river you can almost see from here . ''
Parsing [sent. 784 len. 9]: `` Who put him in the mill ? ''
Parsing [sent. 785 len. 11]: `` His own father , to whom it belongs . ''
Parsing [sent. 786 len. 15]: `` Well , it seems to me a very good match for her . ''
Parsing [sent. 787 len. 10]: `` Yes , indeed , and for him too .
Parsing [sent. 788 len. 27]: But his foolish father thinks the match below him , as if there was any difference between the positions of people in that rank of life !
Parsing [sent. 789 len. 28]: Every one seems striving to tread on the heels of every one else , instead of being content with the station to which God has called them .
Parsing [sent. 790 len. 6]: I am content with mine .
Parsing [sent. 791 len. 10]: I had nothing to do with putting myself there .
Parsing [sent. 792 len. 9]: Why should they not be content with theirs ?
Parsing [sent. 793 len. 13]: They need to be taught Christian humility and respect for their superiors .
Parsing [sent. 794 len. 9]: That 's the virtue most wanted at present .
Parsing [sent. 795 len. 18]: The poor have to look up to the rich '' -- `` That 's right , grannie !
Parsing [sent. 796 len. 12]: And the rich have to look down on the poor . ''
Parsing [sent. 797 len. 6]: `` No , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 798 len. 6]: I did not say that .
Parsing [sent. 799 len. 11]: The rich have to be KIND to the poor . ''
Parsing [sent. 800 len. 13]: `` But , grannie , why did you marry Mr Oldcastle ? ''
Parsing [sent. 801 len. 8]: `` What does the child mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 802 len. 17]: `` Uncle Stoddart says you refused ever so many offers when you were a girl . ''
Parsing [sent. 803 len. 23]: `` Uncle Stoddart has no business to be talking about such things to a chit like you , '' returned the grandmother .
Parsing [sent. 804 len. 16]: smiling , however , at the charge , which so far certainly contained no reproach .
Parsing [sent. 805 len. 19]: `` And grandpapa was the ugliest and the richest of them all -- was n't he , grannie ?
Parsing [sent. 806 len. 10]: and Colonel Markham the handsomest and the poorest ? ''
Parsing [sent. 807 len. 12]: A flush of anger crimsoned the old lady 's pale face .
Parsing [sent. 808 len. 6]: It looked dead no longer .
Parsing [sent. 809 len. 9]: `` Hold your tongue , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 810 len. 6]: `` You are rude . ''
Parsing [sent. 811 len. 19]: And Miss Gladwyn did hold her tongue , but nothing else , for she was laughing all over .
Parsing [sent. 812 len. 12]: The relation between these two was evidently a very odd one .
Parsing [sent. 813 len. 53]: It was clear that Miss Gladwyn was a spoiled child , though I could not help thinking her very nicely spoiled , as far as I saw ; and that the old lady persisted in regarding her as a cub , although her claws had grown quite long enough to be dangerous .
Parsing [sent. 814 len. 32]: Certainly , if things went on thus , it was pretty clear which of them would soon have the upper hand , for grannie was vulnerable , and Pet was not .
Parsing [sent. 815 len. 16]: It really began to look as if there were none but characters in my parish .
Parsing [sent. 816 len. 25]: I began to think it must be the strangest parish in England , and to wonder that I had never heard of it before .
Parsing [sent. 817 len. 12]: `` Surely it must be in some story-book at least ! ''
Parsing [sent. 818 len. 5]: I said to myself .
Parsing [sent. 819 len. 13]: But her grand-daughter 's tiger-cat-play drove the old lady nearer to me .
Parsing [sent. 820 len. 46]: She rose and held out her hand , saying , with some kindness -- `` Take my advice , my dear Mr Walton , and do n't make too much of your poor , or they 'll soon be too much for you to manage .
Parsing [sent. 821 len. 14]: -- Come , Pet : it 's time to go home to lunch .
Parsing [sent. 822 len. 14]: -- And for the surplice , take your own way and wear it .
Parsing [sent. 823 len. 12]: _ I _ sha n't say anything more about it . ''
Parsing [sent. 824 len. 43]: `` I will do what I can see to be right in the matter , '' I answered as gently as I could ; for I did not want to quarrel with her , although I thought her both presumptuous and rude .
Parsing [sent. 825 len. 29]: `` I 'm on your side , Mr Walton , '' said the girl , with a sweet comical smile , as she squeezed my hand once more .
Parsing [sent. 826 len. 22]: I led them to the carriage , and it was with a feeling of relief that I saw it drive off .
Parsing [sent. 827 len. 8]: The old lady certainly was not pleasant .
Parsing [sent. 828 len. 23]: She had a white smooth face over which the skin was drawn tight , gray hair , and rather lurid hazel eyes .
Parsing [sent. 829 len. 37]: I felt a repugnance to her that was hardly to be accounted for by her arrogance to me , or by her superciliousness to the poor ; although either would have accounted for much of it .
Parsing [sent. 830 len. 34]: For I confess that I have not yet learned to bear presumption and rudeness with all the patience and forgiveness with which I ought by this time to be able to meet them .
Parsing [sent. 831 len. 34]: And as to the poor , I am afraid I was always in some danger of being a partizan of theirs against the rich ; and that a clergyman ought never to be .
Parsing [sent. 832 len. 46]: And indeed the poor rich have more need of the care of the clergyman than the others , seeing it is hardly that the rich shall enter into the kingdom of heaven , and the poor have all the advantage over them in that respect .
Parsing [sent. 833 len. 46]: `` Still , '' I said to myself , `` there must be some good in the woman -- she can not be altogether so hard as she looks , else how should that child dare to take the liberties of a kitten with her ?
Parsing [sent. 834 len. 13]: She does n't look to ME like one to make game of !
Parsing [sent. 835 len. 31]: However , I shall know a little more about her when I return her call , and I will do my best to keep on good terms with her . ''
Parsing [sent. 836 len. 33]: I took down a volume of Plato to comfort me after the irritation which my nerves had undergone , and sat down in an easy-chair beside the open window of my study .
Parsing [sent. 837 len. 38]: And with Plato in my hand , and all that outside my window , I began to feel as if , after all , a man might be happy , even if a lady had refused him .
Parsing [sent. 838 len. 43]: And there I sat , without opening my favourite vellum-bound volume , gazing out on the happy world , whence a gentle wind came in , as if to bid me welcome with a kiss to all it had to give me .
Parsing [sent. 839 len. 112]: And then I thought of the wind that bloweth where it listeth , which is everywhere , and I quite forgot to open my Plato , and thanked God for the Life of life , whose story and whose words are in that best of books , and who explains everything to us , and makes us love Socrates and David and all good men ten times more ; and who follows no law but the law of love , and no fashion but the will of God ; for where did ever one read words less like moralising and more like simple earnestness of truth than all those of Jesus ?
Parsing [sent. 840 len. 80]: And I prayed my God that He would make me able to speak good common heavenly sense to my people , and forgive me for feeling so cross and proud towards the unhappy old lady -- for I was sure she was not happy -- and make me into a rock which swallowed up the waves of wrong in its great caverns , and never threw them back to swell the commotion of the angry sea whence they came .
Parsing [sent. 841 len. 14]: Ah , what it would be actually to annihilate wrong in this way !
Parsing [sent. 842 len. 22]: -- to be able to say , it shall not be wrong against me , so utterly do I forgive it !
Parsing [sent. 843 len. 22]: How much sooner , then , would the wrong-doer repent , and get rid of the wrong from his side also !
Parsing [sent. 844 len. 27]: But the painful fact will show itself , not less curious than painful , that it is more difficult to forgive small wrongs than great ones .
Parsing [sent. 845 len. 18]: Perhaps , however , the forgiveness of the great wrongs is not so true as it seems .
Parsing [sent. 846 len. 32]: For do we not think it is a fine thing to forgive such wrongs , and so do it rather for our own sakes than for the sake of the wrongdoer ?
Parsing [sent. 847 len. 16]: It is dreadful not to be good , and to have bad ways inside one .
Parsing [sent. 848 len. 7]: Such thoughts passed through my mind .
Parsing [sent. 849 len. 37]: And once more the great light went up on me with regard to my office , namely , that just because I was parson to the parish , I must not be THE PERSON to myself .
Parsing [sent. 850 len. 36]: And I prayed God to keep me from feeling STUNG and proud , however any one might behave to me ; for all my value lay in being a sacrifice to Him and the people .
Parsing [sent. 851 len. 65]: So when Mrs Pearson knocked at the door , and told me that a lady and gentleman had called , I shut my book which I had just opened , and kept down as well as I could the rising grumble of the inhospitable Englishman , who is apt to be forgetful to entertain strangers , at least in the parlour of his heart .
Parsing [sent. 852 len. 31]: And I can not count it perfect hospitality to be friendly and plentiful towards those whom you have invited to your house -- what thank has a man in that ?
Parsing [sent. 853 len. 18]: -- while you are cold and forbidding to those who have not that claim on your attention .
Parsing [sent. 854 len. 14]: That is not to be perfect as our Father in heaven is perfect .
Parsing [sent. 855 len. 61]: By all means tell people , when you are busy about something that must be done , that you can not spare the time for them except they want you upon something of yet more pressing necessity ; but TELL them , and do not get rid of them by the use of the instrument commonly called THE COLD SHOULDER .
Parsing [sent. 856 len. 19]: It is a wicked instrument that , and ought to have fallen out of use by this time .
Parsing [sent. 857 len. 52]: I went and received Mr and Miss Boulderstone , and was at least thus far rewarded -- that the EERIE feeling , as the Scotch would call it , which I had about my parish , as containing none but CHARACTERS , and therefore not being CANNIE , was entirely removed .
Parsing [sent. 858 len. 13]: At least there was a wholesome leaven in it of honest stupidity .
Parsing [sent. 859 len. 12]: Please , kind reader , do not fancy I am sneering .
Parsing [sent. 860 len. 16]: I declare to you I think a sneer the worst thing God has not made .
Parsing [sent. 861 len. 14]: A curse is nothing in wickedness to it , it seems to me .
Parsing [sent. 862 len. 30]: I do mean that honest stupidity I respect heartily , and do assert my conviction that I do not know how England at least would get on without it .
Parsing [sent. 863 len. 24]: But I do not mean the stupidity that sets up for teaching itself to its neighbour , thinking itself wisdom all the time .
Parsing [sent. 864 len. 6]: That I do not respect .
Parsing [sent. 865 len. 18]: Mr and Miss Boulderstone left me a little fatigued , but in no way sore or grumbling .
Parsing [sent. 866 len. 27]: They only sent me back with additional zest to my Plato , of which I enjoyed a hearty page or two before any one else arrived .
Parsing [sent. 867 len. 78]: The only other visitors I had that day were an old surgeon in the navy , who since his retirement had practised for many years in the neighbourhood , and was still at the call of any one who did not think him too old-fashioned -- for even here the fashions , though decidedly elderly young ladies by the time they arrived , held their sway none the less imperiously -- and Mr Brownrigg , the churchwarden .
Parsing [sent. 868 len. 8]: More of Dr Duncan by and by .
Parsing [sent. 869 len. 15]: Except Mr and Miss Boulderstone , I had not yet seen any common people .
Parsing [sent. 870 len. 28]: They were all decidedly uncommon , and , as regarded most of them , I could not think I should have any difficulty in preaching to them .
Parsing [sent. 871 len. 47]: For , whatever place a man may give to preaching in the ritual of the church -- indeed it does not properly belong to the ritual at all -- it is yet the part of the so-called service with which his personality has most to do .
Parsing [sent. 872 len. 40]: To the influences of the other parts he has to submit himself , ever turning the openings of his soul towards them , that he may not be a mere praying-machine ; but with the sermon it is otherwise .
Parsing [sent. 873 len. 4]: That he produces .
Parsing [sent. 874 len. 6]: For that he is responsible .
Parsing [sent. 875 len. 51]: And therefore , I say , it was a great comfort to me to find myself amongst a people from which my spirit neither shrunk in the act of preaching , nor with regard to which it was likely to feel that it was beating itself against a stone wall .
Parsing [sent. 876 len. 15]: There was some good in preaching to a man like Weir or Old Rogers .
Parsing [sent. 877 len. 18]: Whether there was any good in preaching to a woman like Mrs Oldcastle I did not know .
Parsing [sent. 878 len. 58]: The evening I thought I might give to my books , and thus end my first Monday in my parish ; but , as I said , Mr Brownrigg , the churchwarden , called and stayed a whole weary hour , talking about matters quite uninteresting to any who may hereafter peruse what I am now writing .
Parsing [sent. 879 len. 34]: Really he was not an interesting man : short , broad , stout , red-faced , with an immense amount of mental inertia , discharging itself in constant lingual activity about little nothings .
Parsing [sent. 880 len. 26]: Indeed , when there was no new nothing to be had , the old nothing would do over again to make a fresh fuss about .
Parsing [sent. 881 len. 53]: But if you attempted to convey a thought into his mind which involved the moving round half a degree from where he stood , and looking at the matter from a point even so far new , you found him utterly , totally impenetrable , as pachydermatous as any rhinoceros or behemoth .
Parsing [sent. 882 len. 46]: One other corporeal fact I could not help observing , was , that his cheeks rose at once from the collar of his green coat , his neck being invisible , from the hollow between it and the jaw being filled up to a level .
Parsing [sent. 883 len. 30]: The conformation was just what he himself delighted to contemplate in his pigs , to which his resemblance was greatly increased by unwearied endeavours to keep himself close shaved .
Parsing [sent. 884 len. 14]: -- I could not help feeling anxious about his son and Jane Rogers .
Parsing [sent. 885 len. 44]: -- He gave a quantity of gossip about various people , evidently anxious that I should regard them as he regarded them ; but in all he said concerning them I could scarcely detect one point of significance as to character or history .
Parsing [sent. 886 len. 32]: I was very glad indeed when the waddling of hands -- for it was the perfect imbecility of hand-shaking -- was over , and he was safely out of the gate .
Parsing [sent. 887 len. 34]: He had kept me standing on the steps for full five minutes , and I did not feel safe from him till I was once more in my study with the door shut .
Parsing [sent. 888 len. 25]: I am not going to try my reader 's patience with anything of a more detailed account of my introduction to my various parishioners .
Parsing [sent. 889 len. 16]: I shall mention them only as they come up in the course of my story .
Parsing [sent. 890 len. 34]: Before many days had passed I had found out my poor , who , I thought , must be somewhere , seeing the Lord had said we should have them with us always .
Parsing [sent. 891 len. 65]: There was a workhouse in the village , but there were not a great many in it ; for the poor were kindly enough handled who belonged to the place , and were not too severely compelled to go into the house ; though , I believe , in this house they would have been more comfortable than they were in their own houses .
Parsing [sent. 892 len. 35]: I can not imagine a much greater misfortune for a man , not to say a clergyman , than not to know , or knowing , not to minister to any of the poor .
Parsing [sent. 893 len. 28]: And I did not feel that I knew in the least where I was until I had found out and conversed with almost the whole of mine .
Parsing [sent. 894 len. 54]: After I had done so , I began to think it better to return Mrs Oldcastle 's visit , though I felt greatly disinclined to encounter that tight-skinned nose again , and that mouth whose smile had no light in it , except when it responded to some nonsense of her grand-daughter 's .
Parsing [sent. 895 len. 3]: CHAPTER VI .
Parsing [sent. 896 len. 3]: OLDCASTLE HALL .
Parsing [sent. 897 len. 16]: About noon , on a lovely autumn day , I set out for Oldcastle Hall .
Parsing [sent. 898 len. 24]: The keenness of the air had melted away with the heat of the sun , yet still the air was fresh and invigorating .
Parsing [sent. 899 len. 86]: Can any one tell me why it is that , when the earth is renewing her youth in the spring , man should feel feeble and low-spirited , and gaze with bowed head , though pleased heart , on the crocuses ; whereas , on the contrary , in the autumn , when nature is dying for the winter , he feels strong and hopeful , holds his head erect , and walks with a vigorous step , though the flaunting dahlias discourage him greatly ?
Parsing [sent. 900 len. 34]: I do not ask for the physical causes : those I might be able to find out for myself ; but I ask , Where is the rightness and fitness in the thing ?
Parsing [sent. 901 len. 24]: Should not man and nature go together in this world which was made for man -- not for science , but for man ?
Parsing [sent. 902 len. 11]: Perhaps I have some glimmerings of where the answer lies .
Parsing [sent. 903 len. 11]: Perhaps `` I see a cherub that sees it . ''
Parsing [sent. 904 len. 21]: And in many of our questions we have to be content with such an approximation to an answer as this .
Parsing [sent. 905 len. 10]: And for my part I am content with this .
Parsing [sent. 906 len. 8]: With less , I am not content .
Parsing [sent. 907 len. 25]: Whatever that answer may be , I walked over the old Gothic bridge with a heart strong enough to meet Mrs Oldcastle without flinching .
Parsing [sent. 908 len. 21]: I might have to quarrel with her -- I could not tell : she certainly was neither safe nor wholesome .
Parsing [sent. 909 len. 22]: But this I was sure of , that I would not quarrel with her without being quite certain that I ought .
Parsing [sent. 910 len. 19]: I wish it were NEVER one 's duty to quarrel with anybody : I do so hate it .
Parsing [sent. 911 len. 23]: But not to do it sometimes is to smile in the devil 's face , and that no one ought to do .
Parsing [sent. 912 len. 10]: However , I had not to quarrel this time .
Parsing [sent. 913 len. 50]: The woods on the other side of the river from my house , towards which I was now walking , were of the most sombre rich colour -- sombre and rich , like a life that has laid up treasure in heaven , locked in a casket of sorrow .
Parsing [sent. 914 len. 29]: I came nearer and nearer to them through the village , and approached the great iron gate with the antediluvian monsters on the top of its stone pillars .
Parsing [sent. 915 len. 9]: And awful monsters they were -- are still !
Parsing [sent. 916 len. 13]: I see the tail of one of them at this very moment .
Parsing [sent. 917 len. 13]: But they let me through very quietly , notwithstanding their evil looks .
Parsing [sent. 918 len. 27]: I thought they were saying to each other across the top of the gate , `` Never mind ; he 'll catch it soon enough . ''
Parsing [sent. 919 len. 50]: But , as I said , I did not catch it that day ; and I could not have caught it that day ; it was too lovely a day to catch any hurt even from that most hurtful of all beings under the sun , an unwomanly woman .
Parsing [sent. 920 len. 26]: I wandered up the long winding road , through the woods which I had remarked flanking the meadow on my first walk up the river .
Parsing [sent. 921 len. 28]: These woods smelt so sweetly -- their dead and dying leaves departing in sweet odours -- that they quite made up for the absence of the flowers .
Parsing [sent. 922 len. 51]: And the wind -- no , there was no wind -- there was only a memory of wind that woke now and then in the bosom of the wood , shook down a few leaves , like the thoughts that flutter away in sighs , and then was still again .
Parsing [sent. 923 len. 13]: I am getting old , as I told you , my friends .
Parsing [sent. 924 len. 10]: -LRB- See there , you seem my friends already .
Parsing [sent. 925 len. 22]: Do not despise an old man because he can not help loving people he never saw or even heard of . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 926 len. 14]: I say I am getting old -- -LRB- is it BUT or THEREFORE ?
Parsing [sent. 927 len. 25]: I do not know which -RRB- -- but , therefore , I shall never forget that one autumn day in those grandly fading woods .
Parsing [sent. 928 len. 33]: Up the slope of the hillside they rose like one great rainbow-billow of foliage -- bright yellow , red-rusty and bright fading green , all kinds and shades of brown and purple .
Parsing [sent. 929 len. 42]: Multitudes of leaves lay on the sides of the path , so many that I betook myself to my old childish amusement of walking in them without lifting my feet , driving whole armies of them with ocean-like rustling before me .
Parsing [sent. 930 len. 10]: I did not do so as I came back .
Parsing [sent. 931 len. 57]: I walked in the middle of the way then , and I remember stepping over many single leaves , in a kind of mechanico-merciful way , as if they had been living creatures -- as indeed who can tell but they are , only they must be pretty nearly dead when they are on the ground .
Parsing [sent. 932 len. 11]: At length the road brought me up to the house .
Parsing [sent. 933 len. 17]: It did not look such a large house as I have since found it to be .
Parsing [sent. 934 len. 26]: And it certainly was not an interesting house from the outside , though its surroundings of green grass and trees would make any whole beautiful .
Parsing [sent. 935 len. 54]: Indeed the house itself tried hard to look ugly , not quite succeeding , only because of the kind foiling of its efforts by the Virginia creepers and ivy , which , as if ashamed of its staring countenance , did all they could to spread their hands over it and hide it .
Parsing [sent. 936 len. 47]: But there was one charming group of old chimneys , belonging to some portion behind , which indicated a very different , namely , a very much older , face upon the house once -- a face that had passed away to give place to this .
Parsing [sent. 937 len. 18]: Once inside , I found there were more remains of the olden time than I had expected .
Parsing [sent. 938 len. 42]: I was led up one of those grand square oak staircases , which look like a portion of the house to be dwelt in , and not like a ladder for getting from one part of the habitable regions to another .
Parsing [sent. 939 len. 53]: On the top was a fine expanse of landing , another hall , in fact , from which I was led towards the back of the house by a narrow passage , and shown into a small dark drawing-room with a deep stone-mullioned window , wainscoted in oak simply carved and panelled .
Parsing [sent. 940 len. 12]: Several doors around indicated communication with other parts of the house .
Parsing [sent. 941 len. 25]: Here I found Mrs Oldcastle , reading what I judged to be one of the cheap and gaudy religious books of the present day .
Parsing [sent. 942 len. 21]: She rose and RECEIVED me , and having motioned me to a seat , began to talk about the parish .
Parsing [sent. 943 len. 23]: You would have perceived at once from her tone that she recognised no other bond of connexion between us but the parish .
Parsing [sent. 944 len. 16]: `` I hear you have been most kind in visiting the poor , Mr Walton .
Parsing [sent. 945 len. 16]: You must take care that they do n't take advantage of your kindness , though .
Parsing [sent. 946 len. 14]: I assure you , you will find some of them very grasping indeed .
Parsing [sent. 947 len. 18]: And you need not expect that they will give you the least credit for good intentions . ''
Parsing [sent. 948 len. 14]: `` I have seen nothing yet to make me uneasy on that score .
Parsing [sent. 949 len. 11]: But certainly my testimony is of no weight yet . ''
Parsing [sent. 950 len. 4]: `` Mine is .
Parsing [sent. 951 len. 5]: I have proved them .
Parsing [sent. 952 len. 12]: The poor of this neighbourhood are very deficient in gratitude . ''
Parsing [sent. 953 len. 10]: `` Yes , grannie , -- '' I started .
Parsing [sent. 954 len. 45]: But there was no interruption , such as I have made to indicate my surprise ; although , when I looked half round in the direction whence the voice came , the words that followed were all rippled with a sweet laugh of amusement .
Parsing [sent. 955 len. 9]: `` Yes , grannie , you are right .
Parsing [sent. 956 len. 22]: You remember how old dame Hope would n't take the money you offered her , and dropped such a disdainful courtesy .
Parsing [sent. 957 len. 12]: It was SO greedy of her , was n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 958 len. 17]: `` I am sorry to hear of any disdainful reception of kindness , '' I said .
Parsing [sent. 959 len. 36]: `` Yes , and she had the coolness , within a fortnight , to send up to me and ask if I would be kind enough to lend her half-a-crown for a few weeks . ''
Parsing [sent. 960 len. 10]: `` And then it was your turn , grannie !
Parsing [sent. 961 len. 10]: You sent her five shillings , did n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 962 len. 8]: -- Oh no ; I 'm wrong .
Parsing [sent. 963 len. 7]: That was the other woman . ''
Parsing [sent. 964 len. 13]: `` Indeed , I did not send her anything but a rebuke .
Parsing [sent. 965 len. 30]: I told her that it would be a very wrong thing in me to contribute to the support of such an evil spirit of unthankfulness as she indulged in .
Parsing [sent. 966 len. 32]: When she came to see her conduct in its true light , and confessed that she had behaved very abominably , I would see what I could do for her . ''
Parsing [sent. 967 len. 12]: `` And meantime she was served out , was n't she ?
Parsing [sent. 968 len. 14]: With her sick boy at home , and nothing to give him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 969 len. 4]: said Miss Gladwyn .
Parsing [sent. 970 len. 15]: `` She made her own bed , and had to lie on it . ''
Parsing [sent. 971 len. 24]: `` Do n't you think a little kindness might have had more effect in bringing her to see that she was wrong . ''
Parsing [sent. 972 len. 16]: `` Grannie does n't believe in kindness , except to me -- dear old grannie !
Parsing [sent. 973 len. 4]: She spoils me .
Parsing [sent. 974 len. 31]: I 'm sure I shall be ungrateful some day ; and then she 'll begin to read me long lectures , and prick me with all manner of headless pins .
Parsing [sent. 975 len. 14]: But I wo n't stand it , I can tell you , grannie !
Parsing [sent. 976 len. 9]: I 'm too much spoiled for that . ''
Parsing [sent. 977 len. 31]: Mrs Oldcastle was silent -- why , I could not tell , except it was that she knew she had no chance of quieting the girl in any other way .
Parsing [sent. 978 len. 42]: I may mention here , lest I should have no opportunity afterwards , that I inquired of dame Hope as to her version of the story , and found that there had been a great misunderstanding , as I had suspected .
Parsing [sent. 979 len. 103]: She was really in no want at the time , and did not feel that it would be quite honourable to take the money when she did not need it -- -LRB- some poor people ARE capable of such reasoning -RRB- -- and so had refused it , not without a feeling at the same time that it was more pleasant to refuse than to accept from such a giver ; some stray sparkle of which feeling , discovered by the keen eye of Miss Gladwyn , may have given that appearance of disdain to her courtesy to which the girl alluded .
Parsing [sent. 980 len. 37]: When , however , her boy in service was brought home ill , she had sent to ask for what she now required , on the very ground that it had been offered to her before .
Parsing [sent. 981 len. 33]: The misunderstanding had arisen from the total incapacity of Mrs Oldcastle to enter sympathetically into the feelings of one as superior to herself in character as she was inferior in worldly condition .
Parsing [sent. 982 len. 7]: But to return to Oldcastle Hall .
Parsing [sent. 983 len. 16]: I wished to change the subject , knowing that blind defence is of no use .
Parsing [sent. 984 len. 26]: One must have definite points for defence , if one has not a thorough understanding of the character in question ; and I had neither .
Parsing [sent. 985 len. 12]: `` This is a beautiful old house , '' I said .
Parsing [sent. 986 len. 10]: `` There must be strange places about it . ''
Parsing [sent. 987 len. 35]: Mrs Oldcastle had not time to reply , or at least did not reply , before Miss Gladwyn said -- `` Oh , Mr Walton , have you looked out of the window yet ?
Parsing [sent. 988 len. 17]: You do n't know what a lovely place this is , if you have n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 989 len. 91]: And as she spoke she emerged from a recess in the room , a kind of dark alcove , where she had been amusing herself with what I took to be some sort of puzzle , but which I found afterwards to be the bit and curb-chain of her pony 's bridle which she was polishing up to her own bright mind , because the stable-boy had not pleased her in the matter , and she wanted both to get them brilliant and to shame the lad for the future .
Parsing [sent. 990 len. 22]: I followed her to the window , where I was indeed as much surprised and pleased as she could have wished .
Parsing [sent. 991 len. 4]: `` There ! ''
Parsing [sent. 992 len. 17]: she said , holding back one of the dingy heavy curtains with her small childish hand .
Parsing [sent. 993 len. 10]: And there , indeed , I saw an astonishment .
Parsing [sent. 994 len. 91]: It did not lie in the lovely sweeps of hill and hollow stretching away to the horizon , richly wooded , and -- though I saw none of them -- sprinkled , certainly with sweet villages full of human thoughts , loves , and hopes ; the astonishment did not lie in this -- though all this was really much more beautiful to the higher imagination -- but in the fact that , at the first glance , I had a vision properly belonging to a rugged or mountainous country .
Parsing [sent. 995 len. 34]: For I had approached the house by a gentle slope , which certainly was long and winding , but had occasioned no feeling in my mind that I had reached any considerable height .
Parsing [sent. 996 len. 52]: And I had come up that one beautiful staircase ; no more ; and yet now , when I looked from this window , I found myself on the edge of a precipice -- not a very deep one , certainly , yet with all the effect of many a deeper .
Parsing [sent. 997 len. 31]: For below the house on this side lay a great hollow , with steep sides , up which , as far as they could reach , the trees were climbing .
Parsing [sent. 998 len. 33]: The sides were not all so steep as the one on which the house stood , but they were all rocky and steep , with here and there slopes of green grass .
Parsing [sent. 999 len. 19]: And down in the bottom , in the centre of the hollow , lay a pool of water .
Parsing [sent. 1000 len. 20]: I knew it only by its slaty shimmer through the fading green of the tree-tops between me and it .
Parsing [sent. 1001 len. 4]: `` There ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1002 len. 11]: again exclaimed Miss Gladwyn ; `` is n't that beautiful ?
Parsing [sent. 1003 len. 11]: But you have n't seen the most beautiful thing yet .
Parsing [sent. 1004 len. 7]: Grannie , where 's -- ah !
Parsing [sent. 1005 len. 4]: there she is !
Parsing [sent. 1006 len. 4]: There 's auntie !
Parsing [sent. 1007 len. 15]: Do n't you see her down there , by the side of the pond ?
Parsing [sent. 1008 len. 8]: That pond is a hundred feet deep .
Parsing [sent. 1009 len. 20]: If auntie were to fall in she would be drowned before you could jump down to get her out .
Parsing [sent. 1010 len. 5]: Can you swim ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1011 len. 12]: Before I had time to answer , she was off again .
Parsing [sent. 1012 len. 10]: `` Do n't you see auntie down there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1013 len. 9]: `` No , I do n't see her .
Parsing [sent. 1014 len. 13]: I have been trying very hard , but I ca n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 1015 len. 9]: `` Well , I daresay you ca n't .
Parsing [sent. 1016 len. 11]: Nobody , I think , has got eyes but myself .
Parsing [sent. 1017 len. 36]: Do you see a big stone by the edge of the pond , with another stone on the top of it , like a big potato with a little one grown out of it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1018 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 1019 len. 16]: `` Well , auntie is under the trees on the opposite side from that stone .
Parsing [sent. 1020 len. 7]: Do you see her yet ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1021 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 1022 len. 17]: `` Then you must come down with me , and I will introduce you to her .
Parsing [sent. 1023 len. 8]: She 's much the prettiest thing here .
Parsing [sent. 1024 len. 6]: Much prettier than grannie . ''
Parsing [sent. 1025 len. 59]: Here she looked over her shoulder at grannie , who , instead of being angry , as , from what I had seen on our former interview , I feared she would be , only said , without even looking up from the little blue-boarded book she was again reading -- `` You are a saucy child . ''
Parsing [sent. 1026 len. 6]: Whereupon Miss Gladwyn laughed merrily .
Parsing [sent. 1027 len. 50]: `` Come along , '' she said , and , seizing me by the hand , led me out of the room , down a back-staircase , across a piece of grass , and then down a stair in the face of the rock , towards the pond below .
Parsing [sent. 1028 len. 30]: The stair went in zigzags , and , although rough , was protected by an iron balustrade , without which , indeed , it would have been very dangerous .
Parsing [sent. 1029 len. 19]: `` Is n't your grandmamma afraid to let you run up and down here , Miss Gladwyn ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1030 len. 3]: I said .
Parsing [sent. 1031 len. 4]: `` Me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1032 len. 9]: she exclaimed , apparently in the utmost surprise .
Parsing [sent. 1033 len. 6]: `` That WOULD be fun !
Parsing [sent. 1034 len. 36]: For , you know , if she tried to hinder me -- but she knows it 's no use ; I taught her that long ago -- let me see , how long : oh !
Parsing [sent. 1035 len. 16]: I do n't know -- I should think it must be ten years at least .
Parsing [sent. 1036 len. 15]: I ran away , and they thought I had drowned myself in the pond .
Parsing [sent. 1037 len. 46]: And I saw them , all the time , poking with a long stick in the pond , which , if I had been drowned there , never could have brought me up , for it is a hundred feet deep , I am sure .
Parsing [sent. 1038 len. 13]: How I hurt my sides trying to keep from screaming with laughter !
Parsing [sent. 1039 len. 22]: I fancied I heard one say to the other , ` We must wait till she swells and floats ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 1040 len. 4]: `` Dear me !
Parsing [sent. 1041 len. 6]: what a peculiar child ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1042 len. 5]: I said to myself .
Parsing [sent. 1043 len. 23]: And yet somehow , whatever she said -- even when she was most rude to her grandmother -- she was never offensive .
Parsing [sent. 1044 len. 16]: No one could have helped feeling all the time that she was a little lady .
Parsing [sent. 1045 len. 11]: -- I thought I would venture a question with her .
Parsing [sent. 1046 len. 58]: I stood still at a turn of the zigzag , and looked down into the hollow , still a good way below us , where I could now distinguish the form , on the opposite side of the pond , of a woman seated at the foot of a tree , and stooping forward over a book .
Parsing [sent. 1047 len. 12]: `` May I ask you a question , Miss Gladwyn ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1048 len. 26]: `` Yes , twenty , if you like ; but I wo n't answer one of them till you give up calling me Miss Gladwyn .
Parsing [sent. 1049 len. 17]: We ca n't be friends , you know , so long as you do that . ''
Parsing [sent. 1050 len. 10]: `` What am I to call you , then ?
Parsing [sent. 1051 len. 22]: I never heard you called by any other name than Pet , and that would hardly do , would it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1052 len. 13]: `` Oh , just fancy if you called me Pet before grannie !
Parsing [sent. 1053 len. 40]: That 's grannie 's name for me , and nobody dares to use it but grannie -- not even auntie ; for , between you and me , auntie is afraid of grannie ; I ca n't think why .
Parsing [sent. 1054 len. 18]: I never was afraid of anybody -- except , yes , a little afraid of old Sarah .
Parsing [sent. 1055 len. 35]: She used to be my nurse , you know ; and grandmamma and everybody is afraid of her , and that 's just why I never do one thing she wants me to do .
Parsing [sent. 1056 len. 16]: It would never do to give in to being afraid of her , you know .
Parsing [sent. 1057 len. 19]: -- There 's auntie , you see , down there , just where I told you before . ''
Parsing [sent. 1058 len. 4]: `` Oh yes !
Parsing [sent. 1059 len. 5]: I see her now .
Parsing [sent. 1060 len. 11]: -- What does your aunt call you , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1061 len. 17]: `` Why , what you must call me -- my own name , of course . ''
Parsing [sent. 1062 len. 6]: `` What is that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1063 len. 4]: `` Judy . ''
Parsing [sent. 1064 len. 40]: She said it in a tone which seemed to indicate surprise that I should not know her name -- perhaps read it off her face , as one ought to know a flower 's name by looking at it .
Parsing [sent. 1065 len. 21]: But she added instantly , glancing up in my face most comically -- `` I wish yours was Punch . ''
Parsing [sent. 1066 len. 6]: `` Why , Judy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1067 len. 11]: `` It would be such fun , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 1068 len. 12]: `` Well , it would be odd , I must confess .
Parsing [sent. 1069 len. 8]: What is your aunt 's name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1070 len. 8]: `` Oh , such a funny name !
Parsing [sent. 1071 len. 8]: -- much funnier than Judy : Ethelwyn .
Parsing [sent. 1072 len. 15]: It sounds as if it ought to mean something , does n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1073 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 1074 len. 10]: It is an Anglo-Saxon word , without doubt . ''
Parsing [sent. 1075 len. 7]: `` What does it mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1076 len. 8]: `` I 'm not sure about that .
Parsing [sent. 1077 len. 19]: I will try to find out when I go home -- if you would like to know . ''
Parsing [sent. 1078 len. 7]: `` Yes , that I should .
Parsing [sent. 1079 len. 10]: I should like to know everything about auntie Ethelwyn .
Parsing [sent. 1080 len. 6]: Is n't it pretty ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1081 len. 15]: `` So pretty that I should like to know something more about Aunt Ethelwyn .
Parsing [sent. 1082 len. 7]: What is her other name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1083 len. 10]: `` Why , Ethelwyn Oldcastle , to be sure .
Parsing [sent. 1084 len. 7]: What else could it be ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1085 len. 19]: `` Why , you know , for anything I knew , Judy , it might have been Gladwyn .
Parsing [sent. 1086 len. 10]: She might have been your father 's sister . ''
Parsing [sent. 1087 len. 4]: `` Might she ?
Parsing [sent. 1088 len. 6]: I never thought of that .
Parsing [sent. 1089 len. 14]: Oh , I suppose that is because I never think about my father .
Parsing [sent. 1090 len. 23]: And now I do think of it , I wonder why nobody ever mentions him to me , or my mother either .
Parsing [sent. 1091 len. 12]: But I often think auntie must be thinking about my mother .
Parsing [sent. 1092 len. 21]: Something in her eyes , when they are sadder than usual , seems to remind me of my mother . ''
Parsing [sent. 1093 len. 9]: `` You remember your mother , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1094 len. 12]: `` No , I do n't think I ever saw her .
Parsing [sent. 1095 len. 12]: But I 've answered plenty of questions , have n't I ?
Parsing [sent. 1096 len. 24]: I assure you , if you want to get me on to the Catechism , I do n't know a word of it .
Parsing [sent. 1097 len. 4]: Come along . ''
Parsing [sent. 1098 len. 3]: I laughed .
Parsing [sent. 1099 len. 4]: `` What ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1100 len. 20]: she said , pulling me by the hand , `` you a clergyman , and laugh at the Catechism !
Parsing [sent. 1101 len. 7]: I did n't know that . ''
Parsing [sent. 1102 len. 11]: `` I 'm not laughing at the Catechism , Judy .
Parsing [sent. 1103 len. 15]: I 'm only laughing at the idea of putting Catechism questions to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1104 len. 17]: `` You KNOW I did n't mean it , '' she said , with some indignation .
Parsing [sent. 1105 len. 9]: `` I know now , '' I answered .
Parsing [sent. 1106 len. 17]: `` But you have n't let me put the only question I wanted to put . ''
Parsing [sent. 1107 len. 6]: `` What is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1108 len. 7]: `` How old are you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1109 len. 3]: `` Twelve .
Parsing [sent. 1110 len. 4]: Come along . ''
Parsing [sent. 1111 len. 11]: And away we went down the rest of the stair .
Parsing [sent. 1112 len. 32]: When we reached the bottom , a winding path led us through the trees to the side of the pond , along which we passed to get to the other side .
Parsing [sent. 1113 len. 29]: And then all at once the thought struck me -- why was it that I had never seen this auntie , with the lovely name , at church ?
Parsing [sent. 1114 len. 10]: Was she going to turn out another strange parishioner ?
Parsing [sent. 1115 len. 9]: There she sat , intent on her book .
Parsing [sent. 1116 len. 16]: As we drew near she looked up and rose , but did not come forward .
Parsing [sent. 1117 len. 13]: `` Aunt Winnie , here 's Mr. Walton , '' said Judy .
Parsing [sent. 1118 len. 10]: I lifted my hat and held out my hand .
Parsing [sent. 1119 len. 17]: Before our hands met , however , a tremendous splash reached my ears from the pond .
Parsing [sent. 1120 len. 4]: I started round .
Parsing [sent. 1121 len. 4]: Judy had vanished .
Parsing [sent. 1122 len. 46]: I had my coat half off , and was rushing to the pool , when Miss Oldcastle stopped me , her face unmoved , except by a smile , saying , `` It 's only one of that frolicsome child 's tricks , Mr Walton .
Parsing [sent. 1123 len. 12]: It is well for you that I was here , though .
Parsing [sent. 1124 len. 16]: Nothing would have delighted her more than to have you in the water too . ''
Parsing [sent. 1125 len. 20]: `` But , '' I said , bewildered , and not half comprehending , `` where is she ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1126 len. 34]: `` There , '' returned Miss Oldcastle , pointing to the pool , in the middle of which arose a heaving and bubbling , presently yielding passage to the laughing face of Judy .
Parsing [sent. 1127 len. 12]: `` Why do n't you help me out , Mr Walton ?
Parsing [sent. 1128 len. 7]: You said you could swim . ''
Parsing [sent. 1129 len. 12]: `` No , I did not , '' I answered coolly .
Parsing [sent. 1130 len. 17]: `` You talked so fast , you did not give me time to say so . ''
Parsing [sent. 1131 len. 10]: `` It 's very cold , '' she returned .
Parsing [sent. 1132 len. 12]: `` Come out , Judy dear , '' said her aunt .
Parsing [sent. 1133 len. 8]: `` Run home and change your clothes .
Parsing [sent. 1134 len. 6]: There 's a dear . ''
Parsing [sent. 1135 len. 31]: Judy swam to the opposite side , scrambled out , and was off like a spaniel through the trees and up the stairs , dripping and raining as she went .
Parsing [sent. 1136 len. 16]: `` You must be very much astonished at the little creature , Mr Walton . ''
Parsing [sent. 1137 len. 7]: `` I find her very interesting .
Parsing [sent. 1138 len. 5]: Quite a study . ''
Parsing [sent. 1139 len. 23]: `` There never was a child so spoiled , and never a child on whom it took less effect to hurt her .
Parsing [sent. 1140 len. 8]: I suppose such things do happen sometimes .
Parsing [sent. 1141 len. 28]: She is really a good girl ; though mamma , who has done all the spoiling , will not allow me to say she is good . ''
Parsing [sent. 1142 len. 17]: Here followed a pause , for , Judy disposed of , what should I say next ?
Parsing [sent. 1143 len. 52]: And the moment her mind turned from Judy , I saw a certain stillness -- not a cloud , but the shadow of a cloud -- come over Miss Oldcastle 's face , as if she , too , found herself uncomfortable , and did not know what to say next .
Parsing [sent. 1144 len. 32]: I tried to get a glance at the book in her hand , for I should know something about her at once if I could only see what she was reading .
Parsing [sent. 1145 len. 40]: She never came to church , and I wanted to arrive at some notion of the source of her spiritual life ; for that she had such , a single glance at her face was enough to convince me .
Parsing [sent. 1146 len. 16]: This , I mean , made me even anxious to see what the book was .
Parsing [sent. 1147 len. 32]: But I could only discover that it was an old book in very shabby binding , not in the least like the books that young ladies generally have in their hands .
Parsing [sent. 1148 len. 28]: And now my readers will possibly be thinking it odd that I have never yet said a word about what either Judy or Miss Oldcastle was like .
Parsing [sent. 1149 len. 27]: If there is one thing I feel more inadequate to than another , in taking upon me to relate -- it is to describe a lady .
Parsing [sent. 1150 len. 8]: But I will try the girl first .
Parsing [sent. 1151 len. 10]: Judy was rosy , gray-eyed , auburn-haired , sweet-mouthed .
Parsing [sent. 1152 len. 25]: She had confidence in her chin , assertion in her nose , defiance in her eyebrows , honesty and friendliness over all her face .
Parsing [sent. 1153 len. 29]: No one , evidently , could have a warmer friend ; and to an enemy she would be dangerous no longer than a fit of passion might last .
Parsing [sent. 1154 len. 25]: There was nothing acrid in her ; and the reason , I presume , was , that she had never yet hurt her conscience .
Parsing [sent. 1155 len. 17]: That is a very different thing from saying she had never done wrong , you know .
Parsing [sent. 1156 len. 23]: She was not tall , even for her age , and just a little too plump for the immediate suggestion of grace .
Parsing [sent. 1157 len. 56]: Yet every motion of the child would have been graceful , except for the fact that impulse was always predominant , giving a certain jerkiness , like the hopping of a bird , instead of the gliding of one motion into another , such as you might see in the same bird on the wing .
Parsing [sent. 1158 len. 7]: There is one of the ladies .
Parsing [sent. 1159 len. 12]: But the other -- how shall I attempt to describe her ?
Parsing [sent. 1160 len. 13]: The first thing I felt was , that she was a lady-woman .
Parsing [sent. 1161 len. 14]: And to feel that is almost to fall in love at first sight .
Parsing [sent. 1162 len. 18]: And out of this whole , the first thing you distinguished would be the grace over all .
Parsing [sent. 1163 len. 15]: She was rather slender , rather tall , rather dark-haired , and quite blue-eyed .
Parsing [sent. 1164 len. 20]: But I assure you it was not upon that occasion that I found out the colour of her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1165 len. 15]: I was so taken with her whole that I knew nothing about her parts .
Parsing [sent. 1166 len. 14]: Yet she was blue-eyed , indicating northern extraction -- some centuries back perhaps .
Parsing [sent. 1167 len. 36]: That blue was the blue of the sea that had sunk through the eyes of some sea-rover 's wife and settled in those of her child , to be born when the voyage was over .
Parsing [sent. 1168 len. 44]: It had been dyed so deep INGRAYNE , as Spenser would say , that it had never been worn from the souls of the race since , and so was every now and then shining like heaven out at some of its eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1169 len. 8]: Her features were what is called regular .
Parsing [sent. 1170 len. 6]: They were delicate and brave .
Parsing [sent. 1171 len. 16]: -- After the grace , the dignity was the next thing you came to discover .
Parsing [sent. 1172 len. 16]: And the only thing you would not have liked , you would have discovered last .
Parsing [sent. 1173 len. 71]: For when the shine of the courtesy with which she received me had faded away a certain look of negative haughtiness , of withdrawal , if not of repulsion , took its place , a look of consciousness of her own high breeding -- a pride , not of life , but of circumstance of life , which disappointed me in the midst of so much that was very lovely .
Parsing [sent. 1174 len. 33]: Her voice was sweet , and I could have fancied a tinge of sadness in it , to which impression her slowness of speech , without any drawl in it , contributed .
Parsing [sent. 1175 len. 27]: But I am not doing well as an artist in describing her so fully before my reader has become in the least degree interested in her .
Parsing [sent. 1176 len. 14]: I was seeing her , and no words can make him see her .
Parsing [sent. 1177 len. 50]: Fearing lest some such fancy as had possessed Judy should be moving in her mind , namely , that I was , if not exactly going to put her through her Catechism , yet going in some way or other to act the clergyman , I hastened to speak .
Parsing [sent. 1178 len. 24]: `` This is a most romantic spot , Miss Oldcastle , '' I said ; `` and as surprising as it is romantic .
Parsing [sent. 1179 len. 19]: I could hardly believe my eyes when I looked out of the window and saw it first . ''
Parsing [sent. 1180 len. 23]: `` Your surprise was the more natural that the place itself is not properly natural , as you must have discovered . ''
Parsing [sent. 1181 len. 13]: This was rather a remarkable speech for a young lady to make .
Parsing [sent. 1182 len. 27]: I answered -- `` I only know that such a chasm is the last thing I should have expected to find in this gently undulating country .
Parsing [sent. 1183 len. 21]: That it is artificial I was no more prepared to hear than I was to see the place itself . ''
Parsing [sent. 1184 len. 18]: `` It looks pretty , but it has not a very poetic origin , '' she returned .
Parsing [sent. 1185 len. 22]: `` It is nothing but the quarry out of which the old house at the top of it was built . ''
Parsing [sent. 1186 len. 23]: `` I must venture to differ from you entirely in the aspect such an origin assumes to me , '' I said .
Parsing [sent. 1187 len. 95]: `` It seems to me a more poetic origin than any convulsion of nature whatever would have been ; for , look you , '' I said -- being as a young man too much inclined to the didactic , `` for , look you , '' I said -- and she did look at me -- `` from that buried mass of rock has arisen this living house with its histories of ages and generations ; and '' -- Here I saw a change pass upon her face : it grew almost pallid .
Parsing [sent. 1188 len. 11]: But her large blue eyes were still fixed on mine .
Parsing [sent. 1189 len. 44]: `` And it seems to me , '' I went on , `` that such a chasm made by the uplifting of a house therefrom , is therefore in itself more poetic than if it were even the mouth of an extinct volcano .
Parsing [sent. 1190 len. 75]: For , grand as the motions and deeds of Nature are , terrible as is the idea of the fiery heart of the earth breaking out in convulsions , yet here is something greater ; for human will , human thought , human hands in human labour and effort , have all been employed to build this house , making not only the house beautiful , but the place whence it came beautiful too .
Parsing [sent. 1191 len. 55]: It stands on the edge of what Shelley would call its ` antenatal tomb ' -- now beautiful enough to be its mother -- filled from generation to generation '' -- Her face had grown still paler , and her lips moved as if she would speak ; but no sound came from them .
Parsing [sent. 1192 len. 25]: I had gone on , thinking it best to take no notice of her paleness ; but now I could not help expressing concern .
Parsing [sent. 1193 len. 12]: `` I am afraid you feel ill , Miss Oldcastle . ''
Parsing [sent. 1194 len. 17]: `` Not at all , '' she answered , more quickly than she had yet spoken .
Parsing [sent. 1195 len. 11]: `` This place must be damp , '' I said .
Parsing [sent. 1196 len. 9]: `` I fear you have taken cold . ''
Parsing [sent. 1197 len. 24]: She drew herself up a little haughtily , thinking , no doubt , that after her denial I was improperly pressing the point .
Parsing [sent. 1198 len. 11]: So I drew back to the subject of our conversation .
Parsing [sent. 1199 len. 31]: `` But I can hardly think , '' I said , `` that all this mass of stone could be required to build the house , large as it is .
Parsing [sent. 1200 len. 10]: A house is not solid , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 1201 len. 7]: `` No , '' she answered .
Parsing [sent. 1202 len. 15]: `` The original building was more of a castle , with walls and battlements .
Parsing [sent. 1203 len. 24]: I can show you the foundations of them still ; and the picture , too , of what the place used to be .
Parsing [sent. 1204 len. 8]: We are not what we were then .
Parsing [sent. 1205 len. 15]: Many a cottage , too , has been built out of this old quarry .
Parsing [sent. 1206 len. 16]: Not a stone has been taken from it for the last fifty years , though .
Parsing [sent. 1207 len. 19]: Just let me show you one thing , Mr. Walton , and then I must leave you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1208 len. 10]: `` Do not let me detain you a moment .
Parsing [sent. 1209 len. 40]: I will go at once , '' I said ; `` though , if you would allow me , I should be more at ease if I might see you safe at the top of the stair first . ''
Parsing [sent. 1210 len. 3]: She smiled .
Parsing [sent. 1211 len. 21]: `` Indeed , I am not ill , '' she answered ; `` but I have duties to attend to .
Parsing [sent. 1212 len. 19]: Just let me show you this , and then you shall go with me back to mamma . ''
Parsing [sent. 1213 len. 15]: She led the way to the edge of the pond and looked into it .
Parsing [sent. 1214 len. 18]: I followed , and gazed down into its depths , till my sight was lost in them .
Parsing [sent. 1215 len. 10]: I could see no bottom to the rocky shaft .
Parsing [sent. 1216 len. 13]: `` There is a strong spring down there , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 1217 len. 8]: `` Is it not a dreadful place ?
Parsing [sent. 1218 len. 5]: Such a depth ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1219 len. 25]: `` Yes , '' I answered ; `` but it has not the horror of dirty water ; it is as clear as crystal .
Parsing [sent. 1220 len. 7]: How does the surplus escape ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1221 len. 27]: `` On the opposite side of the hill you came up there is a well , with a strong stream from it into the river . ''
Parsing [sent. 1222 len. 14]: `` I almost wonder at your choosing such a place to read in .
Parsing [sent. 1223 len. 17]: I should hardly like to be so near this pond , '' said I , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 1224 len. 8]: `` Judy has taken all that away .
Parsing [sent. 1225 len. 18]: Nothing in nature , and everything out of it , is strange to Judy , poor child !
Parsing [sent. 1226 len. 14]: But just look down a little way into the water on this side .
Parsing [sent. 1227 len. 6]: Do you see anything ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1228 len. 7]: `` Nothing , '' I answered .
Parsing [sent. 1229 len. 15]: `` Look again , against the wall of the pond , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 1230 len. 17]: `` I see a kind of arch or opening in the side , '' I answered .
Parsing [sent. 1231 len. 10]: `` That is what I wanted you to see .
Parsing [sent. 1232 len. 24]: Now , do you see a little barred window , there , in the face of the rock , through the trees ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1233 len. 12]: `` I can not say I do , '' I replied .
Parsing [sent. 1234 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 1235 len. 20]: Except you know where it is -- and even then -- it is not so easy to find it .
Parsing [sent. 1236 len. 8]: I find it by certain trees . ''
Parsing [sent. 1237 len. 6]: `` What is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1238 len. 27]: `` It is the window of a little room in the rock , from which a stair leads down through the rock to a sloping passage .
Parsing [sent. 1239 len. 13]: That is the end of it you see under the water . ''
Parsing [sent. 1240 len. 21]: `` Provided , no doubt , '' I said , `` in case of siege , to procure water . ''
Parsing [sent. 1241 len. 14]: `` Most likely ; but not , therefore , confined to that purpose .
Parsing [sent. 1242 len. 40]: There are more dreadful stories than I can bear to think of '' -- Here she paused abruptly , and began anew '' -- As if that house had brought death and doom out of the earth with it .
Parsing [sent. 1243 len. 13]: There was an old burial-ground here before the Hall was built . ''
Parsing [sent. 1244 len. 13]: `` Have you ever been down the stair you speak of ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1245 len. 3]: I asked .
Parsing [sent. 1246 len. 11]: `` Only part of the way , '' she answered .
Parsing [sent. 1247 len. 9]: `` But Judy knows every step of it .
Parsing [sent. 1248 len. 33]: If it were not that the door at the top is locked , she would have dived through that archway now , and been in her own room in half the time .
Parsing [sent. 1249 len. 10]: The child does not know what fear means . ''
Parsing [sent. 1250 len. 31]: We now moved away from the pond , towards the side of the quarry and the open-air stair-case , which I thought must be considerably more pleasant than the other .
Parsing [sent. 1251 len. 22]: I confess I longed to see the gleam of that water at the bottom of the dark sloping passage , though .
Parsing [sent. 1252 len. 25]: Miss Oldcastle accompanied me to the room where I had left her mother , and took her leave with merely a bow of farewell .
Parsing [sent. 1253 len. 25]: I saw the old lady glance sharply from her to me as if she were jealous of what we might have been talking about .
Parsing [sent. 1254 len. 17]: `` Grannie , are you afraid Mr. Walton has been saying pretty things to Aunt Winnie ?
Parsing [sent. 1255 len. 10]: I assure you he is not of that sort .
Parsing [sent. 1256 len. 9]: He does n't understand that kind of thing .
Parsing [sent. 1257 len. 23]: But he would have jumped into the pond after me and got his death of cold if auntie would have let him .
Parsing [sent. 1258 len. 4]: It WAS cold .
Parsing [sent. 1259 len. 12]: I think I see you dripping now , Mr Walton . ''
Parsing [sent. 1260 len. 28]: There she was in her dark corner , coiled up on a couch , and laughing heartily ; but all as if she had done nothing extraordinary .
Parsing [sent. 1261 len. 24]: And , indeed , estimated either by her own notions or practices , what she had done was not in the least extraordinary .
Parsing [sent. 1262 len. 52]: Disinclined to stay any longer , I shook hands with the grandmother , with a certain invincible sense of slime , and with the grandchild with a feeling of mischievous health , as if the girl might soon corrupt the clergyman into a partnership in pranks as well as in friendship .
Parsing [sent. 1263 len. 28]: She fallowed me out of the room , and danced before me down the oak staircase , clearing the portion from the first landing at a bound .
Parsing [sent. 1264 len. 22]: Then she turned and waited for me , who came very deliberately , feeling the unsure contact of sole and wax .
Parsing [sent. 1265 len. 29]: As soon as I reached her , she said , in a half-whisper , reaching up towards me on tiptoe -- `` Is n't she a beauty ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1266 len. 3]: `` Who ?
Parsing [sent. 1267 len. 4]: your grandmamma ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1268 len. 3]: I returned .
Parsing [sent. 1269 len. 13]: She gave me a little push , her face glowing with fun .
Parsing [sent. 1270 len. 14]: But I did not expect she would take her revenge as she did .
Parsing [sent. 1271 len. 13]: `` Yes , of course , '' she answered , quite gravely .
Parsing [sent. 1272 len. 8]: `` Is n't she a beauty ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1273 len. 34]: And then , seeing that she had put me hors de combat , she burst into loud laughter , and , opening the hall-door for me , let me go without another word .
Parsing [sent. 1274 len. 46]: I went home very quietly , and , as I said , stepping with curious care -- of which , of course , I did not think at the time -- over the yellow and brown leaves that lay in the middle of the road .
Parsing [sent. 1275 len. 3]: CHAPTER VII .
Parsing [sent. 1276 len. 5]: THE BISHOP 'S BASIN .
Parsing [sent. 1277 len. 43]: I went home very quietly , as I say , thinking about the strange elements that not only combine to make life , but must be combined in our idea of life , before we can form a true theory about it .
Parsing [sent. 1278 len. 61]: Now-a-days , the vulgar notion of what is life-like in any annals is to be realised by sternly excluding everything but the commonplace ; and the means , at least , are often attained , with this much of the end as well -- that the appearance life bears to vulgar minds is represented with a wonderful degree of success .
Parsing [sent. 1279 len. 35]: But I believe that this is , at least , quite as unreal a mode of representing life as the other extreme , wherein the unlikely , the romantic , and the uncommon predominate .
Parsing [sent. 1280 len. 83]: I doubt whether there is a single history -- if one could only get at the whole of it -- in which there is not a considerable admixture of the unlikely become fact , including a few strange coincidences ; of the uncommon , which , although striking at first , has grown common from familiarity with its presence as our own ; with even , at least , some one more or less rosy touch of what we call the romantic .
Parsing [sent. 1281 len. 33]: My own conviction is , that the poetry is far the deepest in us , and that the prose is only broken-down poetry ; and likewise that to this our lives correspond .
Parsing [sent. 1282 len. 54]: The poetic region is the true one , and just , THEREFORE , the incredible one to the lower order of mind ; for although every mind is capable of the truth , or rather capable of becoming capable of the truth , there may lie ages between its capacity and the truth .
Parsing [sent. 1283 len. 31]: As you will hear some people read poetry so that no mortal could tell it was poetry , so do some people read their own lives and those of others .
Parsing [sent. 1284 len. 24]: I fell into these reflections from comparing in my own mind my former experiences in visiting my parishioners with those of that day .
Parsing [sent. 1285 len. 67]: True , I had never sat down to talk with one of them without finding that that man or that woman had actually a HISTORY , the most marvellous and important fact to a human being ; nay , I had found something more or less remarkable in every one of their histories , so that I was more than barely interested in each of them .
Parsing [sent. 1286 len. 72]: And as I made more acquaintance with them , -LRB- for I had not been in the position , or the disposition either , before I came to Marshmallows , necessary to the gathering of such experiences , -RRB- I came to the conclusion -- not that I had got into an extraordinary parish of characters -- but that every parish must be more or less extraordinary from the same cause .
Parsing [sent. 1287 len. 13]: Why did I not use to see such people about me before ?
Parsing [sent. 1288 len. 10]: Surely I had undergone a change of some sort .
Parsing [sent. 1289 len. 36]: Could it be , that the trouble I had been going through of late , had opened the eyes of my mind to the understanding , or rather the simple SEEING , of my fellow-men ?
Parsing [sent. 1290 len. 22]: But the people among whom I had been to-day belonged rather to such as might be put into a romantic story .
Parsing [sent. 1291 len. 39]: Certainly I could not see much that was romantic in the old lady ; and yet , those eyes and that tight-skinned face -- what might they not be capable of in the working out of a story ?
Parsing [sent. 1292 len. 8]: And then the place they lived in !
Parsing [sent. 1293 len. 17]: Why , it would hardly come into my ideas of a nineteenth-century country parish at all .
Parsing [sent. 1294 len. 34]: I was tempted to try to persuade myself that all that had happened , since I rose to look out of the window in the old house , had been but a dream .
Parsing [sent. 1295 len. 12]: For how could that wooded dell have come there after all ?
Parsing [sent. 1296 len. 9]: It was much too large for a quarry .
Parsing [sent. 1297 len. 13]: And that madcap girl -- she never flung herself into the pond !
Parsing [sent. 1298 len. 6]: -- it could not be .
Parsing [sent. 1299 len. 17]: And what could the book have been that the lady with the sea-blue eyes was reading ?
Parsing [sent. 1300 len. 8]: Was that a real book at all ?
Parsing [sent. 1301 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 1302 len. 2]: Yes .
Parsing [sent. 1303 len. 5]: Of course it was .
Parsing [sent. 1304 len. 5]: But what was it ?
Parsing [sent. 1305 len. 9]: What had that to do with the matter ?
Parsing [sent. 1306 len. 13]: It might turn out to be a very commonplace book after all .
Parsing [sent. 1307 len. 16]: No ; for commonplace books are generally new , or at least in fine bindings .
Parsing [sent. 1308 len. 64]: And here was a shabby little old book , such as , if it had been commonplace , would not have been likely to be the companion of a young lady at the bottom of a quarry -- `` A savage place , as holy and enchanted As e'er beneath a waning moon was haunted By woman wailing for her demon lover . ''
Parsing [sent. 1309 len. 48]: I know all this will sound ridiculous , especially that quotation from Kubla Khan coming after the close of the preceding sentence ; but it is only so much the more like the jumble of thoughts that made a chaos of my mind as I went home .
Parsing [sent. 1310 len. 32]: And then for that terrible pool , and subterranean passage , and all that -- what had it all to do with this broad daylight , and these dying autumn leaves ?
Parsing [sent. 1311 len. 8]: No doubt there had been such places .
Parsing [sent. 1312 len. 9]: No doubt there were such places somewhere yet .
Parsing [sent. 1313 len. 8]: No doubt this was one of them .
Parsing [sent. 1314 len. 13]: But , somehow or other , it would not come in well .
Parsing [sent. 1315 len. 21]: I had no intention of GOING IN FOR -- that is the phrase now -- going in for the romantic .
Parsing [sent. 1316 len. 17]: I would take the impression off by going to see Weir the carpenter 's old father .
Parsing [sent. 1317 len. 16]: Whether my plan was successful or not , I shall leave my reader to judge .
Parsing [sent. 1318 len. 15]: I found Weir busy as usual , but not with a coffin this time .
Parsing [sent. 1319 len. 7]: He was working at a window-sash .
Parsing [sent. 1320 len. 12]: `` Just like life , '' I thought -- tritely perhaps .
Parsing [sent. 1321 len. 23]: `` The other day he was closing up in the outer darkness , and now he is letting in the light . ''
Parsing [sent. 1322 len. 23]: `` It 's a long time since you was here last , sir , '' he said , but without a smile .
Parsing [sent. 1323 len. 6]: Did he mean a reproach ?
Parsing [sent. 1324 len. 25]: If so , I was more glad of that reproach than I would have been of the warmest welcome , even from Old Rogers .
Parsing [sent. 1325 len. 57]: The fact was that , having a good deal to attend to besides , and willing at the same time to let the man feel that he was in no danger of being bored by my visits , I had not made use even of my reserve in the shape of a visit to his father .
Parsing [sent. 1326 len. 30]: `` Well , '' I answered , `` I wanted to know something about all my people , before I paid a second visit to any of them . ''
Parsing [sent. 1327 len. 6]: `` All right , sir .
Parsing [sent. 1328 len. 8]: Do n't suppose I meant to complain .
Parsing [sent. 1329 len. 12]: Only to let you know you was welcome , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 1330 len. 13]: `` I 've just come from my first visit to Oldcastle Hall .
Parsing [sent. 1331 len. 87]: And , to tell the truth , for I do n't like pretences , my visit to-day was not so much to you as to your father , whom , perhaps , I ought to have called upon before , only I was afraid of seeming to intrude upon you , seeing we do n't exactly think the same way about some things , '' I added -- with a smile , I know , which was none the less genuine that I remember it yet .
Parsing [sent. 1332 len. 8]: And what makes me remember it yet ?
Parsing [sent. 1333 len. 14]: It is the smile that lighted up his face in response to mine .
Parsing [sent. 1334 len. 9]: For it was more than I looked for .
Parsing [sent. 1335 len. 12]: And his answer helped to fix the smile in my memory .
Parsing [sent. 1336 len. 36]: `` You made me think , sir , that perhaps , after all , we were much of the same way of thinking , only perhaps you was a long way ahead of me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1337 len. 42]: Now the man was not right in saying that we were much of the same way of THINKING ; for our opinions could hardly do more than come within sight of each other ; but what he meant was right enough .
Parsing [sent. 1338 len. 35]: For I was certain , from the first , that the man had a regard for the downright , honest way of things , and I hoped that I too had such a regard .
Parsing [sent. 1339 len. 72]: How much of selfishness and of pride in one 's own judgment might be mixed up with it , both in his case and mine , I had been too often taken in -- by myself , I mean -- to be at all careful to discriminate , provided there was a proportion of real honesty along with it , which , I felt sure , would ultimately eliminate the other .
Parsing [sent. 1340 len. 17]: For in the moral nest , it is not as with the sparrow and the cuckoo .
Parsing [sent. 1341 len. 38]: The right , the original inhabitant is the stronger ; and , however unlikely at any given point in the history it may be , the sparrow will grow strong enough to heave the intruding cuckoo overboard .
Parsing [sent. 1342 len. 53]: So I was pleased that the man should do me the honour of thinking I was right as far as he could see , which is the greatest honour one man can do another ; for it is setting him on his own steed , as the eastern tyrants used to do .
Parsing [sent. 1343 len. 24]: And I was delighted to think that the road lay open for further and more real communion between us in time to come .
Parsing [sent. 1344 len. 19]: `` Well , '' I answered , `` I think we shall understand each other perfectly before long .
Parsing [sent. 1345 len. 16]: But now I must see your father , if it is convenient and agreeable . ''
Parsing [sent. 1346 len. 15]: `` My father will be delighted to see you , I know , sir .
Parsing [sent. 1347 len. 25]: He ca n't get so far as the church on Sundays ; but you 'll find him much more to your mind than me .
Parsing [sent. 1348 len. 33]: He 's been putting ever so many questions to me about the new parson , wanting me to try whether I could n't get more out of you than the old parson .
Parsing [sent. 1349 len. 14]: That 's the way we talk about you , you see , sir .
Parsing [sent. 1350 len. 4]: You 'll understand .
Parsing [sent. 1351 len. 54]: And I 've never told him that I 'd been to church since you came -- I suppose from a bit of pride , because I had so long lefused to go ; but I do n't doubt some of the neighbours have told him , for he never speaks about it now .
Parsing [sent. 1352 len. 30]: And I know he 's been looking out for you ; and I fancy he 's begun to wonder that the parson was going to see everybody but him .
Parsing [sent. 1353 len. 42]: It WILL be a pleasure to the old man , sir , for he do n't see a great many to talk to ; and he 's fond of a bit of gossip , is the old man , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 1354 len. 37]: So saying , Weir led the way through the shop into a lobby behind , and thence up what must have been a back-stair of the old house , into a large room over the workshop .
Parsing [sent. 1355 len. 27]: There were bits of old carving about the walls of the room yet , but , as in the shop below , all had been whitewashed .
Parsing [sent. 1356 len. 18]: At one end stood a bed with chintz curtains and a warm-looking counterpane of rich faded embroidery .
Parsing [sent. 1357 len. 40]: There was a bit of carpet by the bedside , and another bit in front of the fire ; and there the old man sat , on one side , in a high-backed not very easy - looking chair .
Parsing [sent. 1358 len. 22]: With a great effort he managed to rise as I approached him , notwithstanding my entreaties that he would not move .
Parsing [sent. 1359 len. 29]: He looked much older when on his feet , for he was bent nearly double , in which posture the marvel was how he could walk at all .
Parsing [sent. 1360 len. 47]: For he did totter a few steps to meet me , without even the aid of a stick , and , holding out a thin , shaking hand , welcomed me with an air of breeding rarely to be met with in his station in society .
Parsing [sent. 1361 len. 28]: But the chief part of this polish sprung from the inbred kindliness of his nature , which was manifest in the expression of his noble old countenance .
Parsing [sent. 1362 len. 10]: Age is such a different thing in different natures !
Parsing [sent. 1363 len. 104]: One man seems to grow more and more selfish as he grows older ; and in another the slow fire of time seems only to consume , with fine , imperceptible gradations , the yet lingering selfishness in him , letting the light of the kingdom , which the Lord says is within , shine out more and more , as the husk grows thin and is ready to fall off , that the man , like the seed sown , may pierce the earth of this world , and rise into the pure air and wind and dew of the second life .
Parsing [sent. 1364 len. 58]: The face of a loving old man is always to me like a morning moon , reflecting the yet unrisen sun of the other world , yet fading before its approaching light , until , when it does rise , it pales and withers away from our gaze , absorbed in the source of its own beauty .
Parsing [sent. 1365 len. 46]: This old man , you may see , took my fancy wonderfully , for even at this distance of time , when I am old myself , the recollection of his beautiful old face makes me feel as if I could write poetry about him .
Parsing [sent. 1366 len. 14]: `` I 'm blithe to see ye , sir , '' said he .
Parsing [sent. 1367 len. 8]: `` Sit ye down , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 1368 len. 18]: And , turning , he pointed to his own easy-chair ; and I then saw his profile .
Parsing [sent. 1369 len. 15]: It was delicate as that of Dante , which in form it marvellously resembled .
Parsing [sent. 1370 len. 33]: But all the sternness which Dante 's evil times had generated in his prophetic face was in this old man 's replaced by a sweetness of hope that was lovely to behold .
Parsing [sent. 1371 len. 18]: `` No , Mr Weir , '' I said , `` I can not take your chair .
Parsing [sent. 1372 len. 21]: The Bible tells us to rise up before the aged , not to turn them out of their seats . ''
Parsing [sent. 1373 len. 16]: `` It would do me good to see you sitting in my cheer , sir .
Parsing [sent. 1374 len. 22]: The pains that my son Tom there takes to keep it up as long as the old man may want it !
Parsing [sent. 1375 len. 16]: It 's a good thing I bred him to the joiner 's trade , sir .
Parsing [sent. 1376 len. 6]: Sit ye down , sir .
Parsing [sent. 1377 len. 21]: The cheer 'll hold ye , though I warrant it wo n't last that long after I be gone home .
Parsing [sent. 1378 len. 7]: Sit ye down , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 1379 len. 16]: Thus entreated , I hesitated no longer , but took the old man 's seat .
Parsing [sent. 1380 len. 20]: His son brought another chair for him , and he sat down opposite the fire and close to me .
Parsing [sent. 1381 len. 12]: Thomas then went back to his work , leaving us alone .
Parsing [sent. 1382 len. 30]: `` Ye 've had some speech wi ' my son Tom , '' said the old man , the moment he was gone , leaning a little towards me .
Parsing [sent. 1383 len. 23]: `` It 's main kind o ' you , sir , to take up kindly wi ' poor folks like us . ''
Parsing [sent. 1384 len. 22]: `` You do n't say it 's kind of a person to do what he likes best , '' I answered .
Parsing [sent. 1385 len. 14]: `` Besides , it 's my duty to know all my people . ''
Parsing [sent. 1386 len. 10]: `` Oh yes , sir , I know that .
Parsing [sent. 1387 len. 13]: But there 's a thousand ways ov doin ' the same thing .
Parsing [sent. 1388 len. 84]: I ha ' seen folks , parsons and others , ` at made a great show ov bein ' friendly to the poor , ye know , sir ; and all the time you could see , or if you could n't see you could tell without seein ' , that they did n't much regard them in their hearts ; but it was a sort of accomplishment to be able to talk to the poor , like , after their own fashion .
Parsing [sent. 1389 len. 24]: But the minute an ould man sees you , sir , he believes that you MEAN it , sir , whatever it is .
Parsing [sent. 1390 len. 13]: For an ould man somehow comes to know things like a child .
Parsing [sent. 1391 len. 13]: They call it a second childhood , do n't they , sir ?
Parsing [sent. 1392 len. 19]: And there are some things worth growin ' a child again to get a hould ov again . ''
Parsing [sent. 1393 len. 18]: `` I only hope what you say may be true -- about me , I mean . ''
Parsing [sent. 1394 len. 9]: `` Take my word for it , sir .
Parsing [sent. 1395 len. 22]: You have no idea how that boy of mine , Tom there , did hate all the clergy till you come .
Parsing [sent. 1396 len. 22]: Not that he 's anyway favourable to them yet , only he 'll say nothin ' again ' you , sir .
Parsing [sent. 1397 len. 46]: He 's got an unfortunate gift o ' seein ' all the faults first , sir ; and when a man is that way given , the faults always hides the other side , so that there 's nothing but faults to be seen . ''
Parsing [sent. 1398 len. 11]: `` But I find Thomas quite open to reason . ''
Parsing [sent. 1399 len. 18]: `` That 's because you understand him , sir , and know how to give him head .
Parsing [sent. 1400 len. 11]: He tould me of the talk you had with him .
Parsing [sent. 1401 len. 6]: You do n't bait him .
Parsing [sent. 1402 len. 25]: You do n't say , ` You must come along wi ' me , ' but you turns and goes along wi ' him .
Parsing [sent. 1403 len. 21]: He 's not a bad fellow at all , is Tom ; but he will have the reason for everythink .
Parsing [sent. 1404 len. 10]: Now I never did want the reason for everything .
Parsing [sent. 1405 len. 10]: I was content to be tould a many things .
Parsing [sent. 1406 len. 41]: But Tom , you see , he was born with a sore bit in him somewheres , I do n't rightly know wheres ; and I do n't think he rightly knows what 's the matter with him himself . ''
Parsing [sent. 1407 len. 32]: `` I dare say you have a guess though , by this time , Mr. Weir , '' I said ; `` and I think I have a guess too . ''
Parsing [sent. 1408 len. 20]: `` Well , sir , if he 'd only give in , I think he would be far happier .
Parsing [sent. 1409 len. 10]: But he ca n't see his way clear . ''
Parsing [sent. 1410 len. 10]: `` You must give him time , you know .
Parsing [sent. 1411 len. 13]: The fact is , he does n't feel at home yet . '
Parsing [sent. 1412 len. 17]: And how can he , so long as he does n't know his own Father ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1413 len. 22]: `` I 'm not sure that I rightly understand you , '' said the old man , looking bewildered and curious .
Parsing [sent. 1414 len. 57]: `` I mean , '' I answered , `` that till a man knows that he is one of God 's family , living in God 's house , with God up-stairs , as it were , while he is at his work or his play in a nursery below-stairs , he ca n't feel comfortable .
Parsing [sent. 1415 len. 18]: For a man could not be made that should stand alone , like some of the beasts .
Parsing [sent. 1416 len. 21]: A man must feel a head over him , because he 's not enough to satisfy himself , you know .
Parsing [sent. 1417 len. 48]: Thomas just wants faith ; that is , he wants to feel that there is a loving Father over him , who is doing things all well and right , if we could only understand them , though it really does not look like it sometimes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1418 len. 27]: `` Ah , sir , I might have understood you well enough , if my poor old head had n't been started on a wrong track .
Parsing [sent. 1419 len. 22]: For I fancied for the moment that you were just putting your finger upon the sore place in Tom 's mind .
Parsing [sent. 1420 len. 16]: There 's no use in keeping family misfortunes from a friend like you , sir .
Parsing [sent. 1421 len. 23]: That boy has known his father all his life ; but I was nearly half his age before I knew mine . ''
Parsing [sent. 1422 len. 4]: `` Strange ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1423 len. 6]: I said , involuntarily almost .
Parsing [sent. 1424 len. 11]: `` Yes , sir ; strange you may well say .
Parsing [sent. 1425 len. 6]: A strange story it is .
Parsing [sent. 1426 len. 6]: The Lord help my mother !
Parsing [sent. 1427 len. 7]: I beg yer pardon , sir .
Parsing [sent. 1428 len. 5]: I 'm no Catholic .
Parsing [sent. 1429 len. 9]: But that prayer will come of itself sometimes .
Parsing [sent. 1430 len. 10]: As if it could be of any use now !
Parsing [sent. 1431 len. 5]: God forgive me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1432 len. 27]: `` Do n't you be afraid , Mr Weir , as if God was ready to take offence at what comes naturally , as you say .
Parsing [sent. 1433 len. 60]: An ejaculation of love is not likely to offend Him who is so grand that He is always meek and lowly of heart , and whose love is such that ours is a mere faint light -- ' a little glooming light much like a shade ' -- as one of our own poets says , beside it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1434 len. 7]: `` Thank you , Mr Walton .
Parsing [sent. 1435 len. 9]: That 's a real comfortable word , sir .
Parsing [sent. 1436 len. 10]: And I am heart-sure it 's true , sir .
Parsing [sent. 1437 len. 6]: God be praised for evermore !
Parsing [sent. 1438 len. 17]: He IS good , sir ; as I have known in my poor time , sir .
Parsing [sent. 1439 len. 68]: I do n't believe there ever was one that just lifted his eyes and looked up ` ards , instead of looking down to the ground , that did n't get some comfort , to go on with , as it were -- the ready -- money of comfort , as it were -- though it might be none to put in the bank , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 1440 len. 10]: `` That 's true enough , '' I said .
Parsing [sent. 1441 len. 9]: `` Then your father and mother -- ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1442 len. 5]: And here I hesitated .
Parsing [sent. 1443 len. 26]: `` Were never married , sir , '' said the old man promptly , as if he would relieve me from an embarrassing position . ''
Parsing [sent. 1444 len. 8]: _ I _ could n't help it .
Parsing [sent. 1445 len. 15]: And I 'm no less the child of my Father in heaven for it .
Parsing [sent. 1446 len. 22]: For if He had n't made me , I could n't ha ' been their son , you know , sir .
Parsing [sent. 1447 len. 42]: So that He had more to do wi ' the makin ' o ' me than they had ; though mayhap , if He had His way all out , I might ha ' been the son o ' somebody else .
Parsing [sent. 1448 len. 50]: But , now that things be so , I would n't have liked that at all , sir ; and bein ' once born so , I would not have e'er another couple of parents in all England , sir , though I ne'er knew one o ' them .
Parsing [sent. 1449 len. 7]: And I do love my mother .
Parsing [sent. 1450 len. 16]: And I 'm so sorry for my father that I love him too , sir .
Parsing [sent. 1451 len. 28]: And if I could only get my boy Tom to think as I do , I would die like a psalm-tune on an organ , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 1452 len. 28]: `` But it seems to me strange , '' I said , `` that your son should think so much of what is so far gone by .
Parsing [sent. 1453 len. 12]: Surely he would not want another father than you , now .
Parsing [sent. 1454 len. 9]: He is used to his position in life .
Parsing [sent. 1455 len. 16]: And there can be nothing cast up to him about his birth or descent . ''
Parsing [sent. 1456 len. 19]: `` That 's all very true , sir , and no doubt it would be as you say .
Parsing [sent. 1457 len. 15]: But there has been other things to keep his mind upon the old affair .
Parsing [sent. 1458 len. 18]: Indeed , sir , we have had the same misfortune all over again among the young people .
Parsing [sent. 1459 len. 20]: And I must n't say anything more about it ; only my boy Tom has a sore heart . ''
Parsing [sent. 1460 len. 49]: I knew at once to what he alluded ; for I could not have been about in my parish all this time without learning that the strange handsome woman in the little shop was the daughter of Thomas Weir , and that she was neither wife nor widow .
Parsing [sent. 1461 len. 34]: And it now occurred to me for the first time that it was a likeness to her little boy that had affected me so pleasantly when I first saw Thomas , his grandfather .
Parsing [sent. 1462 len. 22]: The likeness to his great-grandfather , which I saw plainly enough , was what made the other fact clear to me .
Parsing [sent. 1463 len. 29]: And at the same moment I began to be haunted with a flickering sense of a third likeness which I could not in the least fix or identify .
Parsing [sent. 1464 len. 20]: `` Perhaps , '' I said , `` he may find some good come out of that too . ''
Parsing [sent. 1465 len. 9]: `` Well , who knows , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1466 len. 29]: `` I think , '' I said , `` that if we do evil that good may come , the good we looked for will never come thereby .
Parsing [sent. 1467 len. 22]: But once evil is done , we may humbly look to Him who bringeth good out of evil , and wait .
Parsing [sent. 1468 len. 8]: Is your granddaughter Catherine in bad health ?
Parsing [sent. 1469 len. 6]: She looks so delicate ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1470 len. 8]: `` She always had an uncommon look .
Parsing [sent. 1471 len. 12]: But what she looks like now , I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 1472 len. 22]: I hear no complaints ; but she has never crossed this door since we got her set up in that shop .
Parsing [sent. 1473 len. 24]: She never conies near her father or her sister , though she lets them , leastways her sister , go and see her .
Parsing [sent. 1474 len. 12]: I 'm afraid Tom has been rayther unmerciful , with her .
Parsing [sent. 1475 len. 61]: And if ever he put a bad name upon her in her hearing , I know , from what that lass used to be as a young one , that she would n't be likely to forget it , and as little likely to get over it herself , or pass it over to another , even her own father .
Parsing [sent. 1476 len. 19]: I do n't believe they do more nor nod to one another when they meet in the village .
Parsing [sent. 1477 len. 10]: It 's well even if they do that much .
Parsing [sent. 1478 len. 19]: It 's my belief there 's some people made so hard that they never can forgive anythink . ''
Parsing [sent. 1479 len. 9]: `` How did she get into the trouble ?
Parsing [sent. 1480 len. 9]: Who is the father of her child ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1481 len. 25]: `` Nay , that no one knows for certain ; though there be suspicions , and one of them , no doubt , correct .
Parsing [sent. 1482 len. 16]: But , I believe , fire would n't drive his name out at her mouth .
Parsing [sent. 1483 len. 5]: I know my lass .
Parsing [sent. 1484 len. 13]: When she says a thing , she 'll stick to it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1485 len. 6]: I asked no more questions .
Parsing [sent. 1486 len. 13]: But , after a short pause , the old man went on .
Parsing [sent. 1487 len. 17]: `` I sha n't soon forget the night I first heard about my father and mother .
Parsing [sent. 1488 len. 5]: That was a night !
Parsing [sent. 1489 len. 28]: The wind was roaring like a mad beast about the house ; -- not this house , sir , but the great house over the way . ''
Parsing [sent. 1490 len. 9]: `` You do n't mean Oldcastle Hall ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1491 len. 4]: I said . ''
Parsing [sent. 1492 len. 49]: ` Deed I do , sir , '' returned the old man , `` This house here belonged to the same family at one time ; though when I was born it was another branch of the family , second cousins or something , that lived in it .
Parsing [sent. 1493 len. 16]: But even then it was something on to the downhill road , I believe . ''
Parsing [sent. 1494 len. 34]: `` But , '' I said , fearing my question might have turned the old man aside from a story worth hearing , `` never mind all that now , if you please .
Parsing [sent. 1495 len. 10]: I am anxious to hear all about that night .
Parsing [sent. 1496 len. 4]: Do go on .
Parsing [sent. 1497 len. 13]: You were saying the wind was blowing about the old house . ''
Parsing [sent. 1498 len. 9]: `` Eh , sir , it was roaring !
Parsing [sent. 1499 len. 10]: - roaring as if it was mad with rage !
Parsing [sent. 1500 len. 36]: And every now and then it would come down the chimley like out of a gun , and blow the smoke and a ` most the fire into the middle of the housekeeper 's room .
Parsing [sent. 1501 len. 10]: For the housekeeper had been giving me my supper .
Parsing [sent. 1502 len. 21]: I called her auntie , then ; and did n't know a bit that she was n't my aunt really .
Parsing [sent. 1503 len. 20]: I was at that time a kind of a under-gamekeeper upon the place , and slept over the stable .
Parsing [sent. 1504 len. 31]: But I fared of the best , for I was a favourite with the old woman -- I suppose because I had given her plenty of trouble in my time .
Parsing [sent. 1505 len. 8]: That 's always the way , sir .
Parsing [sent. 1506 len. 42]: -- Well , as I was a-saying , when the wind stopped for a moment , down came the rain with a noise that sounded like a regiment of cavalry on the turnpike road t ` other side of the hill .
Parsing [sent. 1507 len. 32]: And then up the wind got again , and swept the rain away , and took it all in its own hand again , and went on roaring worse than ever .
Parsing [sent. 1508 len. 62]: ` You 'll be wet afore you get across the yard , Samuel , ' said auntie , looking very prim in her long white apron , as she sat on the other side of the little round table before the fire , sipping a drop of hot rum and water , which she always had before she went to bed .
Parsing [sent. 1509 len. 15]: ` You 'll be wet to the skin , Samuel , ' she said .
Parsing [sent. 1510 len. 34]: ` Never mind , ' says I. ` I 'm not salt , nor yet sugar ; and I 'll be going , auntie , for you 'll be wanting your bed . '
Parsing [sent. 1511 len. 11]: - ` Sit ye still , ' said she . '
Parsing [sent. 1512 len. 9]: I do n't want my bed yet . '
Parsing [sent. 1513 len. 51]: And there she sat , sipping at her rum and water ; and there I sat , o ' the other side , drinking the last of a pint of October , she had gotten me from the cellar -- for I had been out in the wind all day .
Parsing [sent. 1514 len. 19]: ` It was just such a night as this , ' said she , and then stopped again .
Parsing [sent. 1515 len. 15]: -- But I 'm wearying you , sir , with my long story . ''
Parsing [sent. 1516 len. 10]: `` Not in the least , '' I answered .
Parsing [sent. 1517 len. 5]: `` Quite the contrary .
Parsing [sent. 1518 len. 8]: Pray tell it out your own way .
Parsing [sent. 1519 len. 11]: You wo n't tire me , I assure you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1520 len. 9]: So the old man went on . '' '
Parsing [sent. 1521 len. 42]: It was just such a night as this , ' she began again -- ` leastways it was snow and not rain that was coming down , as if the Almighty was a-going to spend all His winter-stock at oncet . '
Parsing [sent. 1522 len. 11]: -- ` What happened such a night , auntie ? '
Parsing [sent. 1523 len. 3]: I said .
Parsing [sent. 1524 len. 7]: ` Ah , my lad ! '
Parsing [sent. 1525 len. 11]: said she , ` ye may well ask what happened .
Parsing [sent. 1526 len. 6]: None has a better right .
Parsing [sent. 1527 len. 3]: You happened .
Parsing [sent. 1528 len. 5]: That 's all . '
Parsing [sent. 1529 len. 14]: -- ` Oh , that 's all , is it , auntie ? '
Parsing [sent. 1530 len. 6]: I said , and laughed .
Parsing [sent. 1531 len. 24]: ` Nay , nay , Samuel , ' said she , quite solemn , ` what is there to laugh at , then ?
Parsing [sent. 1532 len. 11]: I assure you , you was anything but welcome . '
Parsing [sent. 1533 len. 10]: -- ` And why was n't I welcome ? '
Parsing [sent. 1534 len. 4]: I said . '
Parsing [sent. 1535 len. 9]: I could n't help it , you know .
Parsing [sent. 1536 len. 30]: I 'm very sorry to hear I intruded , ' I said , still making game of it , you see ; for I always did like a joke .
Parsing [sent. 1537 len. 14]: ` Well , ' she said , ` you certainly was n't wanted .
Parsing [sent. 1538 len. 19]: But I do n't blame you , Samuel , and I hope you wo n't blame me . '
Parsing [sent. 1539 len. 10]: -- ' What do you mean , auntie ? '
Parsing [sent. 1540 len. 47]: I mean this , that it 's my fault , if so be that fault it is , that you 're sitting there now , and not lying , in less bulk by a good deal , at the bottom of the Bishop 's Basin . '
Parsing [sent. 1541 len. 31]: That 's what they call a deep pond at the foot of the old house , sir ; though why or wherefore , I 'm sure I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 1542 len. 7]: ` Most extraordinary , auntie ! '
Parsing [sent. 1543 len. 19]: I said , feeling very queer , and as if I really had no business to be there .
Parsing [sent. 1544 len. 31]: ` Never you mind , my dear , ' says she ; ` there you are , and you can take care of yourself now as well as anybody . '
Parsing [sent. 1545 len. 10]: -- ` But who wanted to drown me ? '
Parsing [sent. 1546 len. 15]: ` Are you sure you can forgive him , if I tell you ? '
Parsing [sent. 1547 len. 18]: -- ` Sure enough , suppose he was sitting where you be now , ' I answered .
Parsing [sent. 1548 len. 28]: ` It was , I make no doubt , though I ca n't prove it , -- I am morally certain it was your own father . '
Parsing [sent. 1549 len. 18]: I felt the skin go creepin ' together upon my head , and I could n't speak .
Parsing [sent. 1550 len. 18]: ` Yes , it was , child ; and it 's time you knew all about it .
Parsing [sent. 1551 len. 13]: Why , you do n't know who your own father was ! '
Parsing [sent. 1552 len. 21]: -- ` No more I do , ' I said ; ` and I never cared to ask , somehow .
Parsing [sent. 1553 len. 10]: I thought it was all right , I suppose .
Parsing [sent. 1554 len. 10]: But I wonder now that I never did . '
Parsing [sent. 1555 len. 48]: -- ` Indeed you did many a time , when you was a mere boy , like ; but I suppose , as you never was answered , you give it up for a bad job , and forgot all about it , like a wise man .
Parsing [sent. 1556 len. 10]: You always was a wise child , Samuel . '
Parsing [sent. 1557 len. 9]: So the old lady always said , sir .
Parsing [sent. 1558 len. 14]: And I was willing to believe she was right , if I could .
Parsing [sent. 1559 len. 18]: ` But now , ' said she , ` it 's time you knew all about it .
Parsing [sent. 1560 len. 5]: -- Poor Miss Wallis !
Parsing [sent. 1561 len. 35]: -- I 'm no aunt of yours , my boy , though I love you nearly as well , I think , as if I was ; for dearly did I love your mother .
Parsing [sent. 1562 len. 17]: She was a beauty , and better than she was beautiful , whatever folks may say .
Parsing [sent. 1563 len. 22]: The only wrong thing , I 'm certain , that she ever did , was to trust your father too much .
Parsing [sent. 1564 len. 16]: But I must see and give you the story right through from beginning to end .
Parsing [sent. 1565 len. 37]: -- Miss Wallis , as I came to know from her own lips , was the daughter of a country attorney , who had a good practice , and was likely to leave her well off .
Parsing [sent. 1566 len. 10]: Her mother died when she was a little girl .
Parsing [sent. 1567 len. 13]: It 's not easy getting on without a mother , my boy .
Parsing [sent. 1568 len. 14]: So she was n't taught much of the best sort , I reckon .
Parsing [sent. 1569 len. 32]: When her father died early , and she was left atone , the only thing she could do was to take a governess 's place , and she came to us .
Parsing [sent. 1570 len. 30]: She never got on well with the children , for they were young and self willed and rude , and would not learn to do as they were bid .
Parsing [sent. 1571 len. 18]: I never knew one o ' them shut the door when they went out of this room .
Parsing [sent. 1572 len. 30]: And , from having had all her own way at home , with plenty of servants , and money to spend , it was a sore change to her .
Parsing [sent. 1573 len. 11]: But she was a sweet creature , that she was .
Parsing [sent. 1574 len. 44]: She did look sorely tried when Master Freddy would get on the back of her chair , and Miss Gusta would lie down on the rug , and never stir for all she could say to them , but only laugh at her .
Parsing [sent. 1575 len. 6]: -- To be sure ! '
Parsing [sent. 1576 len. 22]: And then auntie would take a sip at her rum and water , and sit considering old times like a static .
Parsing [sent. 1577 len. 20]: And I sat as if all my head was one great ear , and I never spoke a word .
Parsing [sent. 1578 len. 5]: And auntie began again .
Parsing [sent. 1579 len. 14]: ` The way I came to know so much about her was this .
Parsing [sent. 1580 len. 13]: Nobody , you see , took any notice or care of her .
Parsing [sent. 1581 len. 55]: For the children were kept away with her in the old house , and my lady was n't one to take trouble about anybody till once she stood in her way , and then she would just shove her aside or crush her like a spider , and ha ' done with her . '
Parsing [sent. 1582 len. 54]: -- They have always been a proud and a fierce race , the Oldcastles , sir , '' said Weir , taking up the speech in his own person , `` and there 's been a deal o ' breedin in-and-in amongst them , and that has kept up the worst of them .
Parsing [sent. 1583 len. 15]: The men took to the women of their own sort somehow , you see .
Parsing [sent. 1584 len. 12]: The lady up at the old Hall now is a Crowfoot .
Parsing [sent. 1585 len. 18]: I 'll just tell you one thing the gardener told me about her years ago , sir .
Parsing [sent. 1586 len. 33]: She had a fancy for hyacinths in her rooms in the spring , and she Had some particular fine ones ; and a lady of her acquaintance begged for some of them .
Parsing [sent. 1587 len. 8]: And what do you think she did ?
Parsing [sent. 1588 len. 21]: She could n't refuse them , and she could n't bear any one to have them as good as she .
Parsing [sent. 1589 len. 13]: And so she sent the hyacinth-roots -- but she boiled 'em first .
Parsing [sent. 1590 len. 8]: The gardener told me himself , sir .
Parsing [sent. 1591 len. 117]: -- ` And so , when the poor thing , ' said auntie , ` was taken with a dreadful cold , which was no wonder if you saw the state of the window in the room she had to sleep in , and which I got old Jones to set to rights and paid him for it out of my own pocket , else he would n't ha ' done it at all , for the family was n't too much in the way or the means either of paying their debts -- well , there she was , and nobody minding her , and of course it fell to me to look after her .
Parsing [sent. 1592 len. 27]: It would have made your heart bleed to see the poor thing flung all of a heap on her bed , blue with cold and coughing .
Parsing [sent. 1593 len. 5]: `` My dear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1594 len. 19]: I said ; and she burst out crying , and from that moment there was confidence between us .
Parsing [sent. 1595 len. 30]: I made her as warm and as comfortable as I could , but I had to nurse her for a fortnight before she was able to do anything again .
Parsing [sent. 1596 len. 11]: She did n't shirk her work though , poor thing .
Parsing [sent. 1597 len. 38]: It was a heartsore to me to see the poor young thing , with her sweet eyes and her pale face , talking away to those children , that were more like wild cats than human beings .
Parsing [sent. 1598 len. 14]: She might as well have talked to wild cats , I 'm sure .
Parsing [sent. 1599 len. 71]: But I do n't think she was ever so miserable again as she must have been before her illness ; for she used often to come and see me of an evening , and she would sit there where you are sitting now for an hour at a time , without speaking , her thin white hands lying folded in her lap , and her eyes fixed on the fire .
Parsing [sent. 1600 len. 101]: I used to wonder what she could be thinking about , and I had made up my mind she was not long for this world ; when all at once it was announced that Miss Oldcastle , who had been to school for some time , was coming home ; and then we began to see a great deal of company , and for month after month the house was more or less filled with visitors , so that my time was constantly taken up , and I saw much less of poor Miss Wallis than I had seen before .
Parsing [sent. 1601 len. 37]: But when we did meet on some of the back stairs , or when she came to my room for a few minutes before going to bed , we were just as good friends as ever .
Parsing [sent. 1602 len. 27]: And I used to say , `` I wish this scurry was over , my dear , that we might have our old times again . ''
Parsing [sent. 1603 len. 9]: And she would smile and say something sweet .
Parsing [sent. 1604 len. 56]: But I was surprised to see that her health began to come back -- at least so it seemed to me , for her eyes grew brighter and a flush came upon her pale face , and though the children were as tiresome as ever , she did n't seem to mind it so much .
Parsing [sent. 1605 len. 61]: But indeed she had not very much to do with them out of school hours now ; for when the spring came on , they would be out and about the place with their sister or one of their brothers ; and indeed , out of doors it would have been impossible for Miss Wallis to do anything with them .
Parsing [sent. 1606 len. 38]: Some of the visitors would take to them too , for they behaved so badly to nobody as to Miss Wallis , and indeed they were clever children , and could be engaging enough when they pleased .
Parsing [sent. 1607 len. 10]: -- But then I had a blow , Samuel .
Parsing [sent. 1608 len. 56]: It was a lovely spring night , just after the sun was down , and I wanted a drop of milk fresh from the cow for something that I was making for dinner the next day ; so I went through the kitchen-garden and through the belt of young larches to go to the shippen .
Parsing [sent. 1609 len. 47]: But when I got among the trees , who should I see at the other end of the path that went along , but Miss Wallis walking arm-in-arm with Captain Crowfoot , who was just home from India , where he had been with Lord Clive .
Parsing [sent. 1610 len. 52]: The captain was a man about two or three and thirty , a relation of the family , and the son of Sir Giles Crowfoot ' -- who lived then in this old house , sir , and had but that one son , my father , you see , sir .
Parsing [sent. 1611 len. 38]: -- ` And it did give me a turn , ' said my aunt , ` to see her walking with him , for I felt as sure as judgment that no good could come of it .
Parsing [sent. 1612 len. 40]: For the captain had not the best of characters -- that is , when people talked about him in chimney corners , and such like , though he was a great favourite with everybody that knew nothing about him .
Parsing [sent. 1613 len. 65]: He was a fine , manly , handsome fellow , with a smile that , as people said , no woman could resist , though I 'm sure it would have given me no trouble to resist it , whatever they may mean by that , for I saw that that same smile was the falsest thing of all the false things about him .
Parsing [sent. 1614 len. 20]: All the time he was smiling , you would have thought he was looking at himself in a glass .
Parsing [sent. 1615 len. 17]: He was said to have gathered a power of money in India , somehow or other .
Parsing [sent. 1616 len. 27]: But I do n't know , only I do n't think he would have been the favourite he was with my lady if he had n't .
Parsing [sent. 1617 len. 54]: And reports were about , too , of the ways and means by which he had made the money ; some said by robbing the poor heathen creatures ; and some said it was only that his brother officers did n't approve of his speculating as he did in horses and other things .
Parsing [sent. 1618 len. 10]: I do n't know whether officers are so particular .
Parsing [sent. 1619 len. 31]: At all events , this was a fact , for it was one of his own servants that told me , not thinking any harm or any shame of it .
Parsing [sent. 1620 len. 11]: He had quarrelled with a young ensign in the regiment .
Parsing [sent. 1621 len. 12]: On which side the wrong was , I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 1622 len. 18]: But he first thrashed him most unmercifully , and then called him out , as they say .
Parsing [sent. 1623 len. 26]: And when the poor fellow appeared , he could scarcely see out of his eyes , and certainly could n't take anything like an aim .
Parsing [sent. 1624 len. 12]: And he shot him dead , -- did Captain Crowfoot . '
Parsing [sent. 1625 len. 13]: - Think of hearing that about one 's own father , sir !
Parsing [sent. 1626 len. 16]: But I never said a word , for I had n't a word to say .
Parsing [sent. 1627 len. 27]: -- ` Think of that , Samuel , ' said my aunt , ` else you wo n't believe what I am going to tell you .
Parsing [sent. 1628 len. 11]: And you wo n't even then , I dare say .
Parsing [sent. 1629 len. 10]: But I must tell you , nevertheless and notwithstanding .
Parsing [sent. 1630 len. 27]: -- Well , I felt as if the earth was sinking away from under the feet of me , and I stood and stared at them .
Parsing [sent. 1631 len. 50]: And they came on , never seeing me , and actually went close past me and never saw me ; at least , if he saw me he took no notice , for I do n't suppose that the angel with the flaming sword would have put him out .
Parsing [sent. 1632 len. 25]: But for her , I know she did n't see me , for her face was down , burning and smiling at once . '
Parsing [sent. 1633 len. 39]: -- I 'm an old man now , sir , and I never saw my mother ; but I ca n't tell you the story without feeling as if my heart would break for the poor young lady .
Parsing [sent. 1634 len. 49]: -- ' I went back to my room , ' said my aunt , ` with my empty jug in my hand , and I sat down as if I had had a stroke , and I never moved till it was pitch dark and my fire out .
Parsing [sent. 1635 len. 23]: It was a marvel to me afterwards that nobody came near me , for everybody was calling after me at that time .
Parsing [sent. 1636 len. 21]: And it was days before I caught a glimpse of Miss Wallis again , at least to speak to her .
Parsing [sent. 1637 len. 29]: At last , one night she came to my room ; and without a. moment of parley , I said to her , `` Oh , my dear !
Parsing [sent. 1638 len. 9]: what was that wretch saying to you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1639 len. 6]: -- `` What wretch ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1640 len. 7]: says she , quite sharp like .
Parsing [sent. 1641 len. 16]: `` Why , Captain Crowfoot , '' says I , `` to be sure . ''
Parsing [sent. 1642 len. 12]: -- `` What have you to say against Captain Crowfoot ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1643 len. 7]: says she , quite scornful like .
Parsing [sent. 1644 len. 13]: So I tumbled out all I had against him in one breath .
Parsing [sent. 1645 len. 49]: She turned awful pale , and she shook from head to foot , but she was able for all that to say , `` Indian servants are known liars , Mrs Prendergast , '' says she , `` and I do n't believe one word of it all .
Parsing [sent. 1646 len. 14]: But I 'll ask him , the next time I see him . ''
Parsing [sent. 1647 len. 48]: -- `` Do so , my dear , '' I said , not fearing for myself , for I knew he would not make any fuss that might bring the thing out into the air , and hoping that it might lead to a quarrel between them .
Parsing [sent. 1648 len. 42]: And the next time I met her , Samuel -- it was in the gallery that takes to the west turret -- she passed me with a nod just , and a blush instead of a smile on her sweet face .
Parsing [sent. 1649 len. 22]: And I did n't blame her , Samuel ; but I knew that that villain had gotten a hold of her .
Parsing [sent. 1650 len. 12]: And so I could only cry , and that I did .
Parsing [sent. 1651 len. 9]: Things went on like this for some months .
Parsing [sent. 1652 len. 13]: The captain came and went , stopping a week at a time .
Parsing [sent. 1653 len. 32]: Then he stopped for a whole month , and this was in the first of the summer ; and then he said he was ordered abroad again , and went away .
Parsing [sent. 1654 len. 7]: But he did n't go abroad .
Parsing [sent. 1655 len. 30]: He came again in the autumn for the shooting , and began to make up to Miss Oldcastle , who had grown a line young woman by that time .
Parsing [sent. 1656 len. 8]: And then Miss Wallis began to pine .
Parsing [sent. 1657 len. 6]: The captain went away again .
Parsing [sent. 1658 len. 27]: Before long I was certain that if ever young creature was in a consumption , she was ; but she never said a word to me .
Parsing [sent. 1659 len. 23]: How ever the poor thing got on with her work , I ca n't think , but she grew weaker and weaker .
Parsing [sent. 1660 len. 48]: I took the best care of her she would let me , and contrived that she should have her meals in her own room ; but something was between her and me that she never spoke a word about herself , and never alluded to the captain .
Parsing [sent. 1661 len. 20]: By and by came the news that the captain and Miss Oldcastle were to be married in the spring .
Parsing [sent. 1662 len. 29]: And Miss Wallis took to her bed after that ; and my lady said she had never been of much use , and wanted to send her away .
Parsing [sent. 1663 len. 22]: But Miss Oldcastle , who was far superior to any of the rest in her disposition , spoke up for her .
Parsing [sent. 1664 len. 37]: She had been to ask me about her , and I told her the poor thing must go to a hospital if she was sent away , for she had ne'er a home to go to .
Parsing [sent. 1665 len. 12]: And then she went to see the governess , poor thing !
Parsing [sent. 1666 len. 29]: and spoke very kindly to her ; but never a word would Miss Wallis answer ; she only stared at her with great , big , wild-like eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1667 len. 17]: And Miss Oldcastle thought she was out of her mind , and spoke of an asylum .
Parsing [sent. 1668 len. 37]: But I said she had n't long to live , and if she would get my lady her mother to consent to take no notice , I would take all the care and trouble of her .
Parsing [sent. 1669 len. 12]: And she promised , and the poor thing was left alone .
Parsing [sent. 1670 len. 38]: I began to think myself her mind must be going , for not a word would she speak , even to me , though every moment I could spare I was up with her in her room .
Parsing [sent. 1671 len. 28]: Only I was forced to be careful not to be out of the way when my lady wanted me , for that would have tied me more .
Parsing [sent. 1672 len. 34]: At length one day , as I was settling her pillow for her , she all at once threw her arms about my neck , and burst into a terrible fit of crying .
Parsing [sent. 1673 len. 47]: She sobbed and panted for breath so dreadfully , that I put my arms round her and lifted her up to give her relief ; and when I laid her down again , I whispered in her ear , `` I know now , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 1674 len. 10]: I 'll do all I can for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1675 len. 36]: She caught hold of my hand and held it to her lips , and then to her bosom , and cried again , but more quietly , and all was right between us once more .
Parsing [sent. 1676 len. 17]: It was well for her , poor thing , that she could go to her bed .
Parsing [sent. 1677 len. 25]: And I said to myself , `` Nobody need ever know about it ; and nobody ever shall if I can help it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1678 len. 21]: To tell the truth , my hope was that she would die before there was any need for further concealment .
Parsing [sent. 1679 len. 32]: `` But people in that condition seldom die , they say , till all is over ; and so she lived on and on , though plainly getting weaker and weaker .
Parsing [sent. 1680 len. 13]: -- At the captain 's next visit , the wedding-day was fixed .
Parsing [sent. 1681 len. 12]: And after that a circumstance came about that made me uneasy .
Parsing [sent. 1682 len. 20]: A Hindoo servant -- the captain called him his NIGGER always -- had been constantly in attendance upon him .
Parsing [sent. 1683 len. 20]: I never could abide the snake-look of the fellow , nor the noiseless way he went about the house .
Parsing [sent. 1684 len. 14]: But this time the captain had a Hindoo woman with him as well .
Parsing [sent. 1685 len. 68]: He said that his man had fallen in with her in London ; that he had known her before ; that she had come home as nurse with an English family , and it would be very nice for his wife to take her back with her to India , if she could only give her house room , and make her useful till after the wedding .
Parsing [sent. 1686 len. 23]: This was easily arranged , and he went away to return in three weeks , when the wedding was to take place .
Parsing [sent. 1687 len. 40]: Meantime poor Emily grew fast worse , and how she held out with that terrible cough of hers I never could understand -- and spitting blood , too , every other hour or so , though not very much .
Parsing [sent. 1688 len. 67]: And now , to my great trouble , with the preparations for the wedding , I could see yet less of her than before ; and when Miss Oldcastle sent the Hindoo to ask me if she might not sit in the room with the poor girl , I did not know how to object , though I did not at all like her being there .
Parsing [sent. 1689 len. 12]: I felt a great mistrust of the woman somehow or other .
Parsing [sent. 1690 len. 11]: I never did like blacks , and I never shall .
Parsing [sent. 1691 len. 23]: So she went , and sat by her , and waited on her very kindly -- at least poor Emily said so .
Parsing [sent. 1692 len. 29]: I called her Emily because she had begged me , that she might feel as if her mother were with her , and she was a child again .
Parsing [sent. 1693 len. 24]: I had tried before to find out from her when greater care would be necessary , but she could n't tell me anything .
Parsing [sent. 1694 len. 8]: I doubted even if she understood me .
Parsing [sent. 1695 len. 30]: I longed to have the wedding over that I might get rid of the black woman , and have time to take her place , and get everything prepared .
Parsing [sent. 1696 len. 10]: The captain arrived , and his man with him .
Parsing [sent. 1697 len. 12]: And twice I came upon the two blacks in close conversation .
Parsing [sent. 1698 len. 7]: -- Well , the wedding-day came .
Parsing [sent. 1699 len. 30]: The people went to church ; and while they were there a terrible storm of wind and snow came on , such that the horses would hardly face it .
Parsing [sent. 1700 len. 46]: The captain was going to take his bride home to his father , Sir Giles 's ; but , short as the distance was , before the time came the storm got so dreadful that no one could think of leaving the house that night .
Parsing [sent. 1701 len. 26]: The wind blew for all the world just as it blows this night , only it was snow in its mouth , and not rain .
Parsing [sent. 1702 len. 15]: Carriage and horses and all would have been blown off the road for certain .
Parsing [sent. 1703 len. 8]: It did blow , to be sure !
Parsing [sent. 1704 len. 50]: After dinner was over and the ladies were gone to the drawing-room , and the gentlemen had been sitting over their wine for some time , the butler , William Weir -- an honest man , whose wife lived at the lodge -- came to my room looking scared .
Parsing [sent. 1705 len. 6]: `` Lawks , William ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1706 len. 20]: says I , ' said my aunt , sir , ' `` whatever is the matter with you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1707 len. 8]: -- `` Well , Mrs Prendergast ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1708 len. 8]: says he , and said no more .
Parsing [sent. 1709 len. 14]: `` Lawks , William , '' says I , `` speak out . ''
Parsing [sent. 1710 len. 21]: -- `` Well , '' says he , `` Mrs Prendergast , it 's a strange wedding , it is !
Parsing [sent. 1711 len. 31]: There 's the ladies all alone in the withdrawing-room , and there 's the gentlemen calling for more wine , and cursing and swearing that it 's awful to hear .
Parsing [sent. 1712 len. 13]: It 's my belief that swords will be drawn afore long . ''
Parsing [sent. 1713 len. 5]: -- `` Tut ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1714 len. 21]: says I , `` William , it will come the sooner if you do n't give them what they want .
Parsing [sent. 1715 len. 11]: Go and get it as fast as you can . ''
Parsing [sent. 1716 len. 27]: -- `` I do n't a ` most like goin ' down them stairs alone , in sich a night , ma'am , '' says he .
Parsing [sent. 1717 len. 9]: `` Would you mind coming with me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1718 len. 90]: -- `` Dear me , William , '' says I , `` a pretty story to tell your wife '' -- she was my own half-sister , and younger than me -- `` a pretty story to tell your wife , that you wanted an old body like me to go and take care of you in your own cellar , '' says I. `` But I 'll go with you , if you like ; for , to tell the truth , it 's a terrible night . ''
Parsing [sent. 1719 len. 17]: And so down we went , and brought up six bottles more of the best port .
Parsing [sent. 1720 len. 36]: And I really did n't wonder , when I was down there , and heard the dull roar of the wind against the rock below , that William did n't much like to go alone .
Parsing [sent. 1721 len. 22]: -- When he went back with the wine , the captain said , `` William , what kept you so long ?
Parsing [sent. 1722 len. 15]: Mr Centlivre says that you were afraid to go down into the cellar . ''
Parsing [sent. 1723 len. 14]: Now , was n't that odd , for it was a real fact ?
Parsing [sent. 1724 len. 27]: Before William could reply , Sir Giles said , `` A man might well be afraid to go anywhere alone in a night like this . ''
Parsing [sent. 1725 len. 33]: Whereupon the captain cried , with an oath , that he would go down the underground stair , and into every vault on the way , for the wager of a guinea .
Parsing [sent. 1726 len. 21]: And there the matter , according to William , dropped , for the fresh wine was put on the table .
Parsing [sent. 1727 len. 37]: But after they had drunk the most of it -- the captain , according to William , drinking less than usual -- it was brought up again , he could n't tell by which of them .
Parsing [sent. 1728 len. 26]: And in five minutes after , they were all at my door , demanding the key of the room at the top of the stair .
Parsing [sent. 1729 len. 51]: I was just going up to see poor Emily when I heard the noise of their unsteady feet coming along the passage to my door ; and I gave the captain the key at once , wishing with all my heart he might get a good fright for his pains .
Parsing [sent. 1730 len. 26]: He took a jug with him , too , to bring some water up from the well , as a proof he had been down .
Parsing [sent. 1731 len. 32]: The rest of the gentlemen went with him into the little cellar-room ; but they would n't stop there till he came up again , they said it was so cold .
Parsing [sent. 1732 len. 23]: They all came into my room , where they talked as gentlemen would n't do if the wine had n't got uppermost .
Parsing [sent. 1733 len. 9]: It was some time before the captain returned .
Parsing [sent. 1734 len. 9]: It 's a good way down and back .
Parsing [sent. 1735 len. 27]: When he came in at last , he looked as if he had got the fright I wished him , he had such a scared look .
Parsing [sent. 1736 len. 17]: The candle in his lantern was out , and there was no water in the jug .
Parsing [sent. 1737 len. 18]: `` There 's your guinea , Centlivre , '' says he , throwing it on the table .
Parsing [sent. 1738 len. 19]: `` You need n't ask me any questions , for I wo n't answer one of them . ''
Parsing [sent. 1739 len. 36]: -- `` Captain , '' says I , as he turned to leave the room , and the other gentlemen rose to follow him , `` I 'll just hang up the key again . ''
Parsing [sent. 1740 len. 10]: -- '' By all means , '' says he .
Parsing [sent. 1741 len. 8]: `` Where is it , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1742 len. 3]: says I .
Parsing [sent. 1743 len. 15]: He started and made as if he searched his pockets all over for it .
Parsing [sent. 1744 len. 31]: `` I must have dropped it , '' says he ; `` but it 's of no consequence ; you can send William to look for it in the morning .
Parsing [sent. 1745 len. 10]: It ca n't be lost , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 1746 len. 11]: -- `` Very well , captain , '' said I .
Parsing [sent. 1747 len. 35]: But I did n't like being without the key , because of course he had n't locked the door , and that part of the house has a bad name , and no wonder .
Parsing [sent. 1748 len. 12]: It was n't exactly pleasant to have the door left open .
Parsing [sent. 1749 len. 13]: All this time I could n't get to see how Emily was .
Parsing [sent. 1750 len. 23]: As often as I looked from my window , I saw her light in the old west turret out there , Samuel .
Parsing [sent. 1751 len. 10]: You know the room where the bed is still .
Parsing [sent. 1752 len. 13]: The rain and the wind will be blowing right through it to-night .
Parsing [sent. 1753 len. 12]: That 's the bed you was born upon , Samuel . '
Parsing [sent. 1754 len. 46]: -- It 's all gone now , sir , turret and all , like a good deal more about the old place ; but there 's a story about that turret afterwards , only I must n't try to tell you two things at once .
Parsing [sent. 1755 len. 55]: -- ` Now I had told the Indian woman that if anything happened , if she was worse , or wanted to see me , she must put the candle on the right side of the window , and I should always be looking out , and would come directly , whoever might wait .
Parsing [sent. 1756 len. 19]: For I was expecting you some time soon , and nobody knew anything about when you might come .
Parsing [sent. 1757 len. 10]: But there the blind continued drawn down as before .
Parsing [sent. 1758 len. 9]: So I thought all was going on right .
Parsing [sent. 1759 len. 61]: And what with the storm keeping Sir Giles and so many more that would have gone home that night , there was no end of work , and some contrivance necessary , I can tell you , to get them all bedded for the night , for we were nothing too well provided with blankets and linen in the house .
Parsing [sent. 1760 len. 10]: There was always more room than money in it .
Parsing [sent. 1761 len. 38]: So it was past twelve o'clock before I had a minute to myself , and that was only after they had all gone to bed -- the bride and bridegroom in the crimson chamber , of course .
Parsing [sent. 1762 len. 12]: Well , at last I crept quietly into Emily 's room .
Parsing [sent. 1763 len. 46]: I ought to have told you that I had not let her know anything about the wedding being that day , and had enjoined the heathen woman not to say a word ; for I thought she might as well die without hearing about it .
Parsing [sent. 1764 len. 10]: But I believe the vile wretch did tell her .
Parsing [sent. 1765 len. 12]: When I opened the room-door , there was no light there .
Parsing [sent. 1766 len. 8]: I spoke , but no one answered .
Parsing [sent. 1767 len. 22]: I had my own candle in my hand , but it had been blown out as I came up the stair .
Parsing [sent. 1768 len. 43]: I turned and ran along the corridor to reach the main stair , which was the nearest way to my room , when all at once I heard such a shriek from the crimson chamber as I never heard in my life .
Parsing [sent. 1769 len. 8]: It made me all creep like worms .
Parsing [sent. 1770 len. 40]: And in a moment doors and doors were opened , and lights came out , everybody looking terrified ; and what with drink , and horror , and sleep , some of the gentlemen were awful to look upon .
Parsing [sent. 1771 len. 57]: And the door of the crimson chamber opened too , and the captain appeared in his dressing-gown , bawling out to know what was the matter ; though I 'm certain , to this day , the cry did come from that room , and that he knew more about it than any one else did .
Parsing [sent. 1772 len. 36]: As soon as I got a light , however , which I did from Sir Giles 's candle , I left them to settle it amongst them , and ran back to the west turret .
Parsing [sent. 1773 len. 16]: When I entered the room , there was my dear girl lying white and motionless .
Parsing [sent. 1774 len. 19]: There could be no doubt a baby had been born , but no baby was to be seen .
Parsing [sent. 1775 len. 20]: I rushed to the bed ; but though she was still warm , your poor mother was quite dead .
Parsing [sent. 1776 len. 19]: There was no use in thinking about helping her ; but what could have become of the child ?
Parsing [sent. 1777 len. 14]: As if by a light in my mind , I saw it all .
Parsing [sent. 1778 len. 34]: I rushed down to my room , got my lantern , and , without waiting to be afraid , ran to the underground stairs , where I actually found the door standing open .
Parsing [sent. 1779 len. 24]: I had not gone down more than three turnings , when I thought I heard a cry , and I sped faster still .
Parsing [sent. 1780 len. 14]: And just about half-way down , there lay a bundle in a blanket .
Parsing [sent. 1781 len. 20]: And how ever you got over the state I found you in , Samuel , I ca n't think .
Parsing [sent. 1782 len. 49]: But I caught you up as you was , and ran to my own room with you ; and I locked the door , and there being a kettle on the fire , and some conveniences in the place , I did the best for you I could .
Parsing [sent. 1783 len. 16]: For the breath was n't out of you , though it well might have been .
Parsing [sent. 1784 len. 74]: And then I laid you before the fire , and by that time you had begun to cry a little , to my great pleasure , and then I got a blanket off my bed , and wrapt you up in it ; and , the storm being abated by this time , made the best of my way with you through the snow to the lodge , where William 's wife lived .
Parsing [sent. 1785 len. 12]: It was not so far off then as it is now .
Parsing [sent. 1786 len. 30]: But in the midst of my trouble the silly body did make me laugh when he opened the door to me , and saw the bundle in my arms .
Parsing [sent. 1787 len. 18]: `` Mrs Prendergast , '' says he , `` I did n't expect it of you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1788 len. 10]: -- `` Hold your tongue , '' I said .
Parsing [sent. 1789 len. 45]: `` You would never have talked such nonsense if you had had the grace to have any of your own , '' says I. And with that I into the bedroom and shut the door , and left him out there in his shirt .
Parsing [sent. 1790 len. 17]: My sister and I soon got everything arranged , for there was no time to lose .
Parsing [sent. 1791 len. 23]: And before morning I had all made tidy , and your poor mother lying as sweet a corpse as ever angel saw .
Parsing [sent. 1792 len. 10]: And no one could say a word against her .
Parsing [sent. 1793 len. 24]: And it 's my belief that that villain made her believe somehow or other that she was as good as married to him .
Parsing [sent. 1794 len. 44]: She was buried down there in the churchyard , close by the vestry-door , ' said my aunt , sir ; and all of our family have been buried there ever since , my son Tom 's wife among them , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 1795 len. 11]: `` But what was that cry in the house ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1796 len. 12]: I asked `` And what became of the black woman ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1797 len. 22]: `` The woman was never seen again in our quarter ; and what the cry was my aunt never would say .
Parsing [sent. 1798 len. 23]: She seemed to know though ; notwithstanding , as she said , that Captain and Mrs Crowfoot denied all knowledge of it .
Parsing [sent. 1799 len. 25]: But the lady looked dreadful , she said , and never was well again , and died at the birth of her first child .
Parsing [sent. 1800 len. 12]: That was the present Mrs Oldcastle 's father , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 1801 len. 25]: `` But why should the woman have left you on the stair , instead of drowning you in the well at the bottom ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1802 len. 28]: `` My aunt evidently thought there was some mystery about that as well as the other , for she had no doubt about the woman 's intention .
Parsing [sent. 1803 len. 19]: But all she would ever say concerning it was , ` The key was never found , Samuel .
Parsing [sent. 1804 len. 12]: You see I had to get a new one made . '
Parsing [sent. 1805 len. 11]: And she pointed to where it hung on the wall .
Parsing [sent. 1806 len. 14]: ` But that does n't look new now , ' she would say .
Parsing [sent. 1807 len. 11]: ` The lock was very hard to fit again . '
Parsing [sent. 1808 len. 40]: And so you see , sir , I was brought up as her nephew , though people were surprised , no doubt , that William Weir 's wife should have a child , and nobody know she was expecting .
Parsing [sent. 1809 len. 36]: -- Well , with all the reports of the captain 's money , none of it showed in this old place , which from that day began , as it were , to crumble away .
Parsing [sent. 1810 len. 11]: There 's been little repair done upon it since then .
Parsing [sent. 1811 len. 21]: If it had n't been a well-built place to begin with , it would n't be standing now , sir .
Parsing [sent. 1812 len. 13]: But it 's a very different place , I can tell you .
Parsing [sent. 1813 len. 22]: Why , all behind was a garden with terraces , and fruit trees , and gay flowers , to no end .
Parsing [sent. 1814 len. 21]: I remember it as well as yesterday ; nay , a great deal better , for the matter of that .
Parsing [sent. 1815 len. 12]: For I do n't remember yesterday at all , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 1816 len. 14]: I have tried a little to tell the story as he told it .
Parsing [sent. 1817 len. 40]: But I am aware that I have succeeded very badly ; for I am not like my friend in London , who , I verily believe , could give you an exact representation of any dialect he ever heard .
Parsing [sent. 1818 len. 42]: I wish I had been able to give a little more of the form of the old man 's speech ; all I have been able to do is to show a difference from my own way of telling a story .
Parsing [sent. 1819 len. 14]: But in the main , I think , I have reported it correctly .
Parsing [sent. 1820 len. 24]: I believe if the old man was correct in representing his aunt 's account , the story is very little altered between us .
Parsing [sent. 1821 len. 11]: But why should I tell such a story at all ?
Parsing [sent. 1822 len. 58]: I am willing to allow , at once , that I have very likely given it more room than it deserves in these poor Annals of mine ; but the reason why I tell it at all is simply this , that , as it came from the old man 's lips , it interested me greatly .
Parsing [sent. 1823 len. 28]: It certainly did not produce the effect I had hoped to gain from an interview with him , namely , A REDUCTION TO THE COMMON AND PRESENT .
Parsing [sent. 1824 len. 34]: For all this ancient tale tended to keep up the sense of distance between my day 's experience at the Hall and the work I had to do amongst my cottagers and trades-people .
Parsing [sent. 1825 len. 10]: Indeed , it came very strangely upon that experience .
Parsing [sent. 1826 len. 12]: `` But surely you did not believe such an extravagant tale ?
Parsing [sent. 1827 len. 13]: The old man was in his dotage , to begin with . ''
Parsing [sent. 1828 len. 24]: Had the old man been in his dotage , which he was not , my answer would have been a more triumphant one .
Parsing [sent. 1829 len. 9]: For when was dotage consistently and imaginatively inventive ?
Parsing [sent. 1830 len. 9]: But why should I not believe the story ?
Parsing [sent. 1831 len. 47]: There are people who can never believe anything that is not -LRB- I do not say merely in accordance with their own character , but -RRB- in accordance with the particular mood they may happen to be in at the time it is presented to them .
Parsing [sent. 1832 len. 24]: They know nothing of human nature beyond their own immediate preference at the moment for port or sherry , for vice or virtue .
Parsing [sent. 1833 len. 28]: To tell me there could not be a man so lost to shame , if to rectitude , as Captain Crowfoot , is simply to talk nonsense .
Parsing [sent. 1834 len. 60]: Nay , gentle reader , if you -- and let me suppose I address a lady -- if you will give yourself up for thirty years to doing just whatever your lowest self and not your best self may like , I will warrant you capable , by the end of that time , of child murder at least .
Parsing [sent. 1835 len. 18]: I do not think the descent to Avernus is always easy ; but it is always possible .
Parsing [sent. 1836 len. 39]: Many and many such a story was fact in old times ; and human nature being the same still , though under different restraints , equally horrible things are constantly in progress towards the windows of the newspapers .
Parsing [sent. 1837 len. 12]: `` But the whole tale has such a melodramatic air ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1838 len. 43]: That argument simply amounts to this : that , because such subjects are capable of being employed with great dramatic effect , and of being at the same time very badly represented , therefore they can not take place in real life .
Parsing [sent. 1839 len. 27]: But ask any physician of your acquaintance , whether a story is unlikely simply because it involves terrible things such as do not occur every day .
Parsing [sent. 1840 len. 23]: The fact is , that such things , occurring monthly or yearly only , are more easily hidden away out of sight .
Parsing [sent. 1841 len. 37]: Indeed we can have no sense of security for ourselves except in the knowledge that we are striving up and away , and therefore can not be sinking nearer to the region of such awful possibilities .
Parsing [sent. 1842 len. 22]: Yet , as I said before , I am afraid I have given it too large a space in my narrative .
Parsing [sent. 1843 len. 45]: Only it so forcibly reminded me at the time of the expression I could not understand upon Miss Oldcastle 's face , and since then has been so often recalled by circumstances and events , that I felt impelled to record it in full .
Parsing [sent. 1844 len. 8]: And now I have done with it .
Parsing [sent. 1845 len. 35]: I left the old man with thanks for the kind reception he had given me , and walked home , revolving many things with which I shall not detain the attention of my reader .
Parsing [sent. 1846 len. 16]: Indeed my thoughts were confused and troubled , and would ill bear analysis or record .
Parsing [sent. 1847 len. 18]: I shut myself up in my study , and tried to read a sermon of Jeremy Taylor .
Parsing [sent. 1848 len. 6]: But it would not do .
Parsing [sent. 1849 len. 13]: I fell fast asleep over it at last , and woke refreshed .
Parsing [sent. 1850 len. 3]: CHAPTER VIII .
Parsing [sent. 1851 len. 4]: WHAT I PREACHED .
Parsing [sent. 1852 len. 58]: During the suffering which accompanied the disappointment at which I have already hinted , I did not think it inconsistent with the manly spirit in which I was resolved to endure it , to seek consolation from such a source as the New Testament -- if mayhap consolation for such a trouble was to be found there .
Parsing [sent. 1853 len. 20]: Whereupon , a little to my surprise , I discovered that I could not read the Epistles at all .
Parsing [sent. 1854 len. 32]: For I did not then care an atom for the theological discussions in which I had been interested before , and for the sake of which I had read those epistles .
Parsing [sent. 1855 len. 25]: Now that I was in trouble , what to me was that philosophical theology staring me in the face from out the sacred page ?
Parsing [sent. 1856 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 1857 len. 7]: reader , do not misunderstand me .
Parsing [sent. 1858 len. 12]: All reading of the Book is not reading of the Word .
Parsing [sent. 1859 len. 13]: And many that are first shall be last and the last first .
Parsing [sent. 1860 len. 46]: I know NOW that it was Jesus Christ and not theology that filled the hearts of the men that wrote those epistles -- Jesus Christ , the living , loving God-Man , whom I found -- not in the Epistles , but in the Gospels .
Parsing [sent. 1861 len. 17]: The Gospels contain what the apostles preached -- the Epistles what they wrote after the preaching .
Parsing [sent. 1862 len. 121]: And until we understand the Gospel , the good news of Jesus Christ our brother-king -- until we understand Him , until we have His Spirit , promised so freely to them that ask it -- all the Epistles , the words of men who were full of Him , and wrote out of that fulness , who loved Him so utterly that by that very love they were lifted into the air of pure reason and right , and would die for Him , and did die for Him , without two thoughts about it , in the very simplicity of NO CHOICE -- the Letters , I say , of such men are to us a sealed book .
Parsing [sent. 1863 len. 40]: Until we love the Lord so as to do what He tells us , we have no right to have an opinion about what one of those men meant ; for all they wrote is about things beyond us .
Parsing [sent. 1864 len. 55]: The simplest woman who tries not to judge her neighbour , or not to be anxious for the morrow , will better know what is best to know , than the best-read bishop without that one simple outgoing of his highest nature in the effort to do the will of Him who thus spoke .
Parsing [sent. 1865 len. 26]: But I have , as is too common with me , been led away by my feelings from the path to the object before me .
Parsing [sent. 1866 len. 45]: What I wanted to say was this : that , although I could make nothing of the epistles , could see no possibility of consolation for my distress springing from them , I found it altogether different when I tried the Gospel once more .
Parsing [sent. 1867 len. 17]: Indeed , it then took such a hold of me as it had never taken before .
Parsing [sent. 1868 len. 7]: Only that is simply saying nothing .
Parsing [sent. 1869 len. 37]: I found out that I had known nothing at all about it ; that I had only a certain surface-knowledge , which tended rather to ignorance , because it fostered the delusion that I did know .
Parsing [sent. 1870 len. 7]: Know that man , Christ Jesus !
Parsing [sent. 1871 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 1872 len. 29]: Lord , I would go through fire and water to sit the last at Thy table in Thy kingdom ; but dare I say now I KNOW Thee !
Parsing [sent. 1873 len. 28]: -- But Thou art the Gospel , for Thou art the Way , the Truth , and the Life ; and I have found Thee the Gospel .
Parsing [sent. 1874 len. 65]: For I found , as I read , that Thy very presence in my thoughts , not as the theologians show Thee , but as Thou showedst Thyself to them who report Thee to us , smoothed the troubled waters of my spirit , so that , even while the storm lasted , I was able to walk upon them to go to Thee .
Parsing [sent. 1875 len. 129]: And when those waters became clear , I most rejoiced in their clearness because they mirrored Thy form -- because Thou wert there to my vision -- the one Ideal , the perfect man , the God perfected as king of men by working out His Godhood in the work of man ; revealing that God and man are one ; that to serve God , a man must be partaker of the Divine nature ; that for a man 's work to be done thoroughly , God must come and do it first Himself ; that to help men , He must be what He is -- man in God , God in man -- visibly before their eyes , or to the hearing of their ears .
Parsing [sent. 1876 len. 5]: So much I saw .
Parsing [sent. 1877 len. 41]: And therefore , when I was once more in a position to help my fellows , what could I want to give them but that which was the very bread and water of life to me -- the Saviour himself ?
Parsing [sent. 1878 len. 8]: And how was I to do this ?
Parsing [sent. 1879 len. 29]: -- By trying to represent the man in all the simplicity of His life , of His sayings and doings , of His refusals to say or do .
Parsing [sent. 1880 len. 46]: -- I took the story from the beginning , and told them about the Baby ; trying to make the fathers and mothers , and all whose love for children supplied the lack of fatherhood and motherhood , feel that it was a real baby-boy .
Parsing [sent. 1881 len. 69]: And I followed the life on and on , trying to show them how He felt , as far as one might dare to touch such sacred things , when He did so and so , or said so and so ; and what His relation to His father and mother and brothers and sisters was , and to the different kinds of people who came about Him .
Parsing [sent. 1882 len. 100]: And I tried to show them what His sayings meant , as far as I understood them myself , and where I could not understand them I just told them so , and said I hoped for more light by and by to enable me to understand them ; telling them that that hope was a sharp goad to my resolution , driving me on to do my duty , because I knew that only as I did my duty would light go up in my heart , making me wise to understand the precious words of my Lord .
Parsing [sent. 1883 len. 30]: And I told them that if they would try to do their duty , they would find more understanding from that than from any explanation I could give them .
Parsing [sent. 1884 len. 10]: And so I went on from Sunday to Sunday .
Parsing [sent. 1885 len. 72]: And the number of people that slept grew less and less , until , at last , it was reduced to the churchwarden , Mr Brownrigg , and an old washerwoman , who , poor thing , stood so much all the week , that sitting down with her was like going to bed , and she never could do it , as she told me , without going to sleep .
Parsing [sent. 1886 len. 89]: I , therefore , called upon her every Monday morning , and had five minutes ' chat with her as she stood at her wash-tub , wishing to make up to her for her drowsiness ; and thinking that if I could once get her interested in anything , she might be able to keep awake a little while at the beginning of the sermon ; for she gave me no chance of interesting her on Sundays -- going fast asleep the moment I stood up to preach .
Parsing [sent. 1887 len. 101]: I never got so far as that , however ; and the only fact that showed me I had made any impression upon her , beyond the pleasure she always manifested when I appeared on the Monday , was , that , whereas all my linen had been very badly washed at first , a decided improvement took place after a while , beginning with my surplice and bands , and gradually extending itself to my shirts and handkerchiefs ; till at last even Mrs Pearson was unable to find any fault with the poor old sleepy woman 's work .
Parsing [sent. 1888 len. 41]: For Mr Brownrigg , I am not sure that the sense of any one sentence I ever uttered , down to the day of his death , entered into his brain -- I dare not say his mind or heart .
Parsing [sent. 1889 len. 25]: With regard to him , and millions besides , I am more than happy to obey my Lord 's command , and not judge .
Parsing [sent. 1890 len. 19]: But it was not long either before my congregations began to improve , whatever might be the cause .
Parsing [sent. 1891 len. 27]: I could not help hoping that it was really because they liked to hear the Gospel , that is , the good news about Christ himself .
Parsing [sent. 1892 len. 25]: And I always made use of the knowledge I had of my individual hearers , to say what I thought would do them good .
Parsing [sent. 1893 len. 30]: Not that I ever preached AT anybody ; I only sought to explain the principles of things in which I knew action of some sort was demanded from them .
Parsing [sent. 1894 len. 89]: For I remembered how our Lord 's sermon against covetousness , with the parable of the rich man with the little barn , had for its occasion the request of a man that our Lord would interfere to make his brother share with him ; which He declining to do , yet gave both brothers a lesson such as , if they wished to do what was right , would help them to see clearly what was the right thing to do in this and every such matter .
Parsing [sent. 1895 len. 30]: Clear the mind 's eye , by washing away the covetousness , and the whole nature would be full of light , and the right walk would speedily follow .
Parsing [sent. 1896 len. 61]: Before long , likewise , I was as sure of seeing the pale face of Thomas Weir perched , like that of a man beheaded for treason , upon the apex of the gablet of the old tomb , as I was of hearing the wonderful playing of that husky old organ , of which I have spoken once before .
Parsing [sent. 1897 len. 42]: I continued to pay him a visit every now and then ; and I assure you , never was the attempt to be thoroughly honest towards a man better understood or more appreciated than my attempt was by the ATHEISTICAL carpenter .
Parsing [sent. 1898 len. 28]: The man was no more an atheist than David was when he saw the wicked spreading like a green bay-tree , and was troubled at the sight .
Parsing [sent. 1899 len. 13]: He only wanted to see a God in whom he could trust .
Parsing [sent. 1900 len. 32]: And if I succeeded at all in making him hope that there might be such a God , it is to me one of the most precious seals of my ministry .
Parsing [sent. 1901 len. 28]: But it was now getting very near Christmas , and there was one person whom I had never yet seen at church : that was Catherine Weir .
Parsing [sent. 1902 len. 40]: I thought , at first , it could hardly be that she shrunk from being seen ; for how then could she have taken to keeping a shop , where she must be at the beck of every one ?
Parsing [sent. 1903 len. 66]: I had several times gone and bought tobacco of her since that first occasion ; and I had told my housekeeper to buy whatever she could from her , instead of going to the larger shop in the place ; at which Mrs Pearson had grumbled a good deal , saying how could the things be so good out of a poky shop like that ?
Parsing [sent. 1904 len. 60]: But I told her I did not care if the things were not quite as good ; for it would be of more consequence to Catherine to have the custom , than it would be to me to have the one lump of sugar I put in my tea of a morning one shade or even two shades whiter .
Parsing [sent. 1905 len. 58]: So I had contrived to keep up a kind of connexion with her , although I saw that any attempt at conversation was so distasteful to her , that it must do harm until something should have brought about a change in her feelings ; though what feeling wanted changing , I could not at first tell .
Parsing [sent. 1906 len. 36]: I came to the conclusion that she had been wronged grievously , and that this wrong operating on a nature similar to her father 's , had drawn all her mind to brood over it .
Parsing [sent. 1907 len. 56]: The world itself , the whole order of her life , everything about her , would seem then to have wronged her ; and to speak to her of religion would only rouse her scorn , and make her feel as if God himself , if there were a God , had wronged her too .
Parsing [sent. 1908 len. 45]: Evidently , likewise , she had that peculiarity of strong , undeveloped natures , of being unable , once possessed by one set of thoughts , to get rid of it again , or to see anything except in the shadow of those thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 1909 len. 66]: I had no doubt , however , at last , that she was ashamed of her position in the eyes of society , although a hitherto indomitable pride had upheld her to face it so far as was necessary to secure her independence ; both of which -- pride and shame -- prevented her from appearing where it was unnecessary , and especially in church .
Parsing [sent. 1910 len. 12]: I could do nothing more than wait for a favourable opportunity .
Parsing [sent. 1911 len. 32]: I could invent no way of reaching her yet ; for I had soon found that kindness to her boy was regarded rather in the light of an insult to her .
Parsing [sent. 1912 len. 33]: I should have been greatly puzzled to account for his being such a sweet little fellow , had I not known that he was a great deal with his aunt and grandfather .
Parsing [sent. 1913 len. 16]: A more attentive and devout worshipper was not in the congregation than that little boy .
Parsing [sent. 1914 len. 44]: Before going on to speak of another of the most remarkable of my parishioners , whom I have just once mentioned I believe already , I should like to say that on three several occasions before Christmas I had seen Judy look grave .
Parsing [sent. 1915 len. 16]: She was always quite well-behaved in church , though restless , as one might expect .
Parsing [sent. 1916 len. 21]: But on these occasions she was not only attentive , but grave , as if she felt something or other .
Parsing [sent. 1917 len. 44]: I will not mention what subjects I was upon at those times , because the mention of them would not , in the minds of my readers , at all harmonise with the only notion of Judy they can yet by possibility have .
Parsing [sent. 1918 len. 21]: For Mrs Oldcastle , I never saw her change countenance or even expression at anything -- I mean in church .
Parsing [sent. 1919 len. 3]: CHAPTER IX .
Parsing [sent. 1920 len. 3]: THE ORGANIST .
Parsing [sent. 1921 len. 29]: On the afternoon of my second Sunday at Marshmallows , I was standing in the churchyard , casting a long shadow in the light of the declining sun .
Parsing [sent. 1922 len. 32]: I was reading the inscription upon an old headstone , for I thought everybody was gone ; when I heard a door open , and shut again before I could turn .
Parsing [sent. 1923 len. 27]: I saw at once that it must have been a little door in the tower , almost concealed from where I stood by a deep buttress .
Parsing [sent. 1924 len. 25]: I had never seen the door open , and I had never inquired anything about it , supposing it led merely into the tower .
Parsing [sent. 1925 len. 43]: After a moment it opened again , and , to my surprise , out came , stooping his tall form to get his gray head clear of the low archway , a man whom no one could pass without looking after him .
Parsing [sent. 1926 len. 34]: Tall , and strongly built , he had the carriage of a military man , without an atom of that sternness which one generally finds in the faces of those accustomed to command .
Parsing [sent. 1927 len. 29]: He had a large face , with large regular features , and large clear gray eyes , all of which united to express an exceeding placidity or repose .
Parsing [sent. 1928 len. 19]: It shone with intelligence -- a mild intelligence -- no way suggestive of profundity , although of geniality .
Parsing [sent. 1929 len. 10]: Indeed , there was a little too much expression .
Parsing [sent. 1930 len. 11]: The face seemed to express ALL that lay beneath it .
Parsing [sent. 1931 len. 15]: I was not satisfied with the countenance ; and yet it looked quite good .
Parsing [sent. 1932 len. 8]: It was somehow a too well-ordered face .
Parsing [sent. 1933 len. 49]: It was quite Greek in its outline ; and marvellously well kept and smooth , considering that the beard , to which razors were utterly strange , and which descended half-way down his breast , would have been as white as snow except for a slight yellowish tinge .
Parsing [sent. 1934 len. 16]: His eyebrows were still very dark , only just touched with the frost of winter .
Parsing [sent. 1935 len. 25]: His hair , too , as I saw when he lifted his hat , was still wonderfully dark for the condition of his beard .
Parsing [sent. 1936 len. 18]: -- It flashed into my mind , that this must be the organist who played so remarkably .
Parsing [sent. 1937 len. 11]: Somehow I had not happened yet to inquire about him .
Parsing [sent. 1938 len. 22]: But there was a stateliness in this man amounting almost to consciousness of dignity ; and I was a little bewildered .
Parsing [sent. 1939 len. 17]: His clothes were all of black , very neat and clean , but old-fashioned and threadbare .
Parsing [sent. 1940 len. 15]: They bore signs of use , but more signs of time and careful keeping .
Parsing [sent. 1941 len. 32]: I would have spoken to him , but something in the manner in which he bowed to me as he passed , prevented me , and I let him go unaccosted .
Parsing [sent. 1942 len. 21]: The sexton coming out directly after , and proceeding to lock the door , I was struck by the action .
Parsing [sent. 1943 len. 10]: `` What IS he locking the door for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1944 len. 5]: I said to myself .
Parsing [sent. 1945 len. 17]: But I said nothing to him , because I had not answered the question myself yet .
Parsing [sent. 1946 len. 18]: `` Who is that gentleman , '' I asked , `` who came out just now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1947 len. 12]: `` That is Mr Stoddart , sir , '' he answered .
Parsing [sent. 1948 len. 12]: I thought I had heard the name in the neighbourhood before .
Parsing [sent. 1949 len. 10]: `` Is it he who plays the organ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1950 len. 3]: I asked .
Parsing [sent. 1951 len. 7]: `` That he do , sir .
Parsing [sent. 1952 len. 22]: He 's played our organ for the last ten year , ever since he come to live at the Hall . ''
Parsing [sent. 1953 len. 5]: `` What Hall ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1954 len. 17]: `` Why the Hall , to be sure , -- Oldcastle Hall , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 1955 len. 17]: And then it dawned on my recollection that I had heard Judy mention her uncle Stoddart .
Parsing [sent. 1956 len. 8]: But how could he be her uncle ?
Parsing [sent. 1957 len. 10]: `` Is he a relation of the family ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1958 len. 3]: I asked .
Parsing [sent. 1959 len. 29]: `` He 's a brother-in-law , I believe , of the old lady , sir , but how ever he come to live there I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 1960 len. 12]: It 's no such binding connexion , you know , sir .
Parsing [sent. 1961 len. 21]: He 's been in the milintairy line , I believe , sir , in the Ingies , or somewheres . ''
Parsing [sent. 1962 len. 30]: I do not think I shall have any more strange parishioners to present to my readers ; at least I do not remember any more just at this moment .
Parsing [sent. 1963 len. 17]: And this one , as the reader will see , I positively could not keep out .
Parsing [sent. 1964 len. 6]: A military man from India !
Parsing [sent. 1965 len. 12]: a brother-in-law of Mrs Oldcastle , choosing to live with her !
Parsing [sent. 1966 len. 13]: an entrancing performer upon an old , asthmatic , dry-throated church organ !
Parsing [sent. 1967 len. 34]: taking no trouble to make the clergyman 's acquaintance , and passing him in the churchyard with a courteous bow , although his face was full of kindliness , if not of kindness !
Parsing [sent. 1968 len. 9]: I could not help thinking all this strange .
Parsing [sent. 1969 len. 16]: And yet -- will the reader cease to accord me credit when I assert it ?
Parsing [sent. 1970 len. 57]: -- although I had quite intended to inquire after him when I left the vicarage to go to the Hall , and had even thought of him when sitting with Mrs Oldcastle , I never thought of him again after going with Judy , and left the house without having made a single inquiry after him .
Parsing [sent. 1971 len. 87]: Nor did I think of him again till just as I was passing under the outstretched neck of one of those serpivolants on the gate ; and what made me think of him then , I can not in the least imagine ; but I resolved at once that I would call upon him the following week , lest he should think that the fact of his having omitted to call upon me had been the occasion of such an apparently pointed omission on my part .
Parsing [sent. 1972 len. 34]: For I had long ago determined to be no further guided by the rules of society than as they might aid in bringing about true neighbourliness , and if possible friendliness and friendship .
Parsing [sent. 1973 len. 33]: Wherever they might interfere with these , I would disregard them -- as far on the other hand as the disregard of them might tend to bring about the results I desired .
Parsing [sent. 1974 len. 72]: When , carrying out this resolution , I rang the doorbell at the Hall , and inquired whether Mr Stoddart was at home , the butler stared ; and , as I simply continued gazing in return , and waiting , he answered at length , with some hesitation , as if he were picking and choosing his words : `` Mr Stoddart never calls upon any one , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 1975 len. 22]: `` I am not complaining of Mr Stoddart , '' I answered , wishing to put the man at his ease .
Parsing [sent. 1976 len. 12]: `` But nobody calls upon Mr Stoddart , '' he returned .
Parsing [sent. 1977 len. 14]: `` That 's very unkind of somebody , surely , '' I said .
Parsing [sent. 1978 len. 15]: `` But he does n't want anybody to call upon him , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 1979 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 1980 len. 5]: that 's another matter .
Parsing [sent. 1981 len. 6]: I did n't know that .
Parsing [sent. 1982 len. 12]: Of course , nobody has a right to intrude upon anybody .
Parsing [sent. 1983 len. 54]: However , as I happen to have come without knowing his dislike to being visited , perhaps you will take him my card , and say that if it is not disagreeable to him , I should like exceedingly to thank him in person for his sermon on the organ last Sunday . ''
Parsing [sent. 1984 len. 10]: He had played an exquisite voluntary in the morning .
Parsing [sent. 1985 len. 23]: `` Give my message exactly , if you please , '' I said , as I followed the man into the hall .
Parsing [sent. 1986 len. 11]: `` I will try , sir , '' he answered .
Parsing [sent. 1987 len. 23]: `` But wo n't you come up-stairs to mistress 's room , sir , while I take this to Mr Stoddart ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1988 len. 11]: `` No , I thank you , '' I answered .
Parsing [sent. 1989 len. 25]: `` I came to call upon Mr Stoddart only , and I will wait the result of you mission here in the hall . ''
Parsing [sent. 1990 len. 23]: The man withdrew , and I sat down on a bench , and amused myself with looking at the portraits about me .
Parsing [sent. 1991 len. 44]: I learned afterwards that they had hung , till some thirty years before , in a long gallery connecting the main part of the house with that portion to which the turret referred to so often in Old Weir 's story was attached .
Parsing [sent. 1992 len. 5]: One particularly pleased me .
Parsing [sent. 1993 len. 36]: It was the portrait of a young woman -- very lovely -- but with an expression both sad and -- scared , I think , would be the readiest word to communicate what I mean .
Parsing [sent. 1994 len. 11]: It was indubitably , indeed remarkably , like Miss Oldcastle .
Parsing [sent. 1995 len. 25]: And I learned afterwards that it was the portrait of Mrs Oldcastle 's grandmother , that very Mrs Crowfoot mentioned in Weir 's story .
Parsing [sent. 1996 len. 19]: It had been taken about six months after her marriage , and about as many before her death .
Parsing [sent. 1997 len. 13]: The butler returned , with the request that I would follow him .
Parsing [sent. 1998 len. 63]: He led me up the grand staircase , through a passage at right angles to that which led to the old lady 's room , up a narrow circular staircase at the end of the passage , across a landing , then up a straight steep narrow stair , upon which two people could not pass without turning sideways and then squeezing .
Parsing [sent. 1999 len. 20]: At the top of this I found myself in a small cylindrical lobby , papered in blocks of stone .
Parsing [sent. 2000 len. 8]: There was no door to be seen .
Parsing [sent. 2001 len. 8]: It was lighted by a conical skylight .
Parsing [sent. 2002 len. 9]: My conductor gave a push against the wall .
Parsing [sent. 2003 len. 9]: Certain blocks yielded , and others came forward .
Parsing [sent. 2004 len. 31]: In fact a door revolved on central pivots , and we were admitted to a chamber crowded with books from floor to ceiling , arranged with wonderful neatness and solidity .
Parsing [sent. 2005 len. 58]: From the centre of the ceiling , whence hung a globular lamp , radiated what I took to be a number of strong beams supporting a floor above ; for our ancestors put the ceiling above the beams , instead of below them , as we do , and gained in space if they lost in quietness .
Parsing [sent. 2006 len. 8]: But I soon found out my mistake .
Parsing [sent. 2007 len. 8]: Those radiating beams were in reality book-shelves .
Parsing [sent. 2008 len. 22]: For on each side of those I passed under I could see the gilded backs of books standing closely ranged together .
Parsing [sent. 2009 len. 21]: I had never seen the connivance before , nor , I presume , was it to be seen anywhere else .
Parsing [sent. 2010 len. 10]: `` How does Mr Stoddart reach those books ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2011 len. 5]: I asked my conductor .
Parsing [sent. 2012 len. 14]: `` I do n't exactly know , sir , '' whispered the butler .
Parsing [sent. 2013 len. 12]: `` His own man could tell you , I dare say .
Parsing [sent. 2014 len. 30]: But he has a holiday to-day ; and I do not think he would explain it either ; for he says his master allows no interference with his contrivances .
Parsing [sent. 2015 len. 13]: I believe , however , he does not use a ladder . ''
Parsing [sent. 2016 len. 21]: There was no one in the room , and I saw no entrance but that by which we had entered .
Parsing [sent. 2017 len. 25]: The next moment , however , a nest of shelves revolved in front of me , and there Mr Stoddart stood with outstretched hand .
Parsing [sent. 2018 len. 23]: `` You have found me at last , Mr Walton , and I am glad to see you , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2019 len. 18]: He led me into an inner room , much larger than the one I had passed through .
Parsing [sent. 2020 len. 50]: `` I am glad , '' I replied , `` that I did not know , till the butler told me , your unwillingness to be intruded upon ; for I fear , had I known it , I should have been yet longer a stranger to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2021 len. 8]: `` You are no stranger to me .
Parsing [sent. 2022 len. 15]: I have heard you read prayers , and I have heard you preach . ''
Parsing [sent. 2023 len. 18]: `` And I have heard you play ; so you are no stranger to me either . ''
Parsing [sent. 2024 len. 29]: `` Well , before we say another word , '' said Mr Stoddart , `` I must just say one word about this report of my unsociable disposition .
Parsing [sent. 2025 len. 15]: -- I encourage it ; but am very glad to see you , notwithstanding .
Parsing [sent. 2026 len. 6]: -- Do sit down . ''
Parsing [sent. 2027 len. 12]: I obeyed , and waited for the rest of his word .
Parsing [sent. 2028 len. 44]: `` I was so bored with visits after I came , visits which were to me utterly uninteresting , that I was only too glad when the unusual nature of some of my pursuits gave rise to the rumour that I was mad .
Parsing [sent. 2029 len. 49]: The more people say I am mad , the better pleased I am , so long as they are satisfied with my own mode of shutting myself up , and do not attempt to carry out any fancies of their own in regard to my personal freedom . ''
Parsing [sent. 2030 len. 17]: Upon this followed some desultory conversation , during which I took some observations of the room .
Parsing [sent. 2031 len. 15]: Like the outer room , it was full of books from floor to ceiling .
Parsing [sent. 2032 len. 11]: But the ceiling was divided into compartments , harmoniously coloured .
Parsing [sent. 2033 len. 10]: `` What a number of books you have ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2034 len. 3]: I observed .
Parsing [sent. 2035 len. 10]: `` Not a great many , '' he answered .
Parsing [sent. 2036 len. 21]: `` But I think there is hardly one of them with which I have not some kind of personal acquaintance .
Parsing [sent. 2037 len. 42]: I think I could almost find you any one you wanted in the dark , or in the twilight at least , which would allow me to distinguish whether the top edge was gilt , red , marbled , or uncut .
Parsing [sent. 2038 len. 13]: I have bound a couple of hundred or so of them myself .
Parsing [sent. 2039 len. 14]: I do n't think you could tell the work from a tradesman 's .
Parsing [sent. 2040 len. 20]: I 'll give you a guinea for the poor-box if you pick out three of my binding consecutively . ''
Parsing [sent. 2041 len. 27]: I accepted the challenge ; for although I could not bind a book , I considered myself to have a keen eye for the outside finish .
Parsing [sent. 2042 len. 24]: After looking over the backs of a great many , I took one down , examined a little further , and presented it .
Parsing [sent. 2043 len. 5]: `` You are right .
Parsing [sent. 2044 len. 5]: Now try again . ''
Parsing [sent. 2045 len. 9]: Again I was successful , although I doubted .
Parsing [sent. 2046 len. 11]: `` And now for the last , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2047 len. 6]: Once more I was right .
Parsing [sent. 2048 len. 14]: `` There is your guinea , '' said he , a little mortified .
Parsing [sent. 2049 len. 7]: `` No , '' I answered .
Parsing [sent. 2050 len. 29]: `` I do not feel at liberty to take it , because , to tell the truth , the last was a mere guess , nothing more . ''
Parsing [sent. 2051 len. 5]: Mr Stoddart looked relieved .
Parsing [sent. 2052 len. 15]: `` You are more honest than most of your profession , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2053 len. 23]: `` But I am far more pleased to offer you the guinea upon the smallest doubt of your having won it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2054 len. 9]: `` I have no claim upon it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2055 len. 3]: `` What !
Parsing [sent. 2056 len. 17]: Could n't you swallow a small scruple like that for the sake of the poor even ?
Parsing [sent. 2057 len. 9]: Well , I do n't believe YOU could .
Parsing [sent. 2058 len. 17]: -- Oblige me by taking this guinea for some one or other of your poor people .
Parsing [sent. 2059 len. 13]: But I AM glad you were n't sure of that last book .
Parsing [sent. 2060 len. 5]: I am indeed . ''
Parsing [sent. 2061 len. 12]: I took the guinea , and put it in my purse .
Parsing [sent. 2062 len. 16]: `` But , '' he resumed , `` you wo n't do , Mr Walton .
Parsing [sent. 2063 len. 8]: You 're not fit for your profession .
Parsing [sent. 2064 len. 11]: You wo n't tell a lie for God 's sake .
Parsing [sent. 2065 len. 18]: You wo n't dodge about a little to keep all right between Jove and his weary parishioners .
Parsing [sent. 2066 len. 13]: You wo n't cheat a little for the sake of the poor !
Parsing [sent. 2067 len. 12]: You would n't even bamboozle a little at a bazaar ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2068 len. 31]: `` I should not like to boast of my principles , '' I answered ; `` for the moment one does so , they become as the apples of Sodom .
Parsing [sent. 2069 len. 16]: But assuredly I would not favour a fiction to keep a world out of hell .
Parsing [sent. 2070 len. 23]: The hell that a lie would keep any man out of is doubtless the very best place for him to go to .
Parsing [sent. 2071 len. 14]: It is truth , yes , The Truth that saves the world . ''
Parsing [sent. 2072 len. 8]: `` You are right , I daresay .
Parsing [sent. 2073 len. 12]: You are more sure about it than I am though . ''
Parsing [sent. 2074 len. 34]: `` Let us agree where we can , '' I said , `` first of all ; and that will make us able to disagree , where we must , without quarrelling . ''
Parsing [sent. 2075 len. 18]: `` Good , '' he said -- `` Would you like to see my work shop ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2076 len. 12]: `` Very much , indeed , '' I answered , heartily .
Parsing [sent. 2077 len. 11]: `` Do you take any pleasure in applied mechanics ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2078 len. 10]: `` I used to do so as a boy .
Parsing [sent. 2079 len. 15]: But of course I have little time now for anything of the sort . ''
Parsing [sent. 2080 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 2081 len. 4]: of course . ''
Parsing [sent. 2082 len. 7]: He pushed a compartment of books .
Parsing [sent. 2083 len. 10]: It yielded , and we entered a small closet .
Parsing [sent. 2084 len. 25]: In another moment I found myself leaving the floor , and in yet a moment we were on the floor of an upper room .
Parsing [sent. 2085 len. 10]: `` What a nice way of getting up-stairs ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2086 len. 3]: I said .
Parsing [sent. 2087 len. 17]: `` There is no other way of getting to this room , '' answered Mr Stoddart .
Parsing [sent. 2088 len. 14]: `` I built it myself ; and there was no room for stairs .
Parsing [sent. 2089 len. 5]: This is my shop .
Parsing [sent. 2090 len. 10]: In my library I only read my favourite books .
Parsing [sent. 2091 len. 28]: Here I read anything I want to read ; write anything I want to write ; bind my books ; invent machines ; and amuse myself generally .
Parsing [sent. 2092 len. 5]: Take a chair . ''
Parsing [sent. 2093 len. 10]: I obeyed , and began to look about me .
Parsing [sent. 2094 len. 9]: The room had many books in detached book-cases .
Parsing [sent. 2095 len. 45]: There were various benches against the walls between , -- one a bookbinder 's ; another a carpenter 's ; a third had a turning-lathe ; a fourth had an iron vice fixed on it , and was evidently used for working in metal .
Parsing [sent. 2096 len. 38]: Besides these , for it was a large room , there were several tables with chemical apparatus upon them , Florence-flasks , retorts , sand-baths , and such like ; while in a corner stood a furnace .
Parsing [sent. 2097 len. 14]: `` What an accumulation of ways and means you have about you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2098 len. 14]: I said ; `` and all , apparently , to different ends . ''
Parsing [sent. 2099 len. 14]: `` All to the same end , if my object were understood . ''
Parsing [sent. 2100 len. 14]: `` I presume I must ask no questions as to that object ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2101 len. 8]: `` It would take time to explain .
Parsing [sent. 2102 len. 6]: I have theories of education .
Parsing [sent. 2103 len. 11]: I think a man has to educate himself into harmony .
Parsing [sent. 2104 len. 20]: Therefore he must open every possible window by which the influences of the All may come in upon him .
Parsing [sent. 2105 len. 31]: I do not think any man complete without a perfect development of his mechanical faculties , for instance , and I encourage them to develop themselves into such windows . ''
Parsing [sent. 2106 len. 24]: `` I do not object to your theory , provided you do not put it forward as a perfect scheme of human life .
Parsing [sent. 2107 len. 22]: If you did , I should have some questions to ask you about it , lest I should misunderstand you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2108 len. 10]: He smiled what I took for a self-satisfied smile .
Parsing [sent. 2109 len. 17]: There was nothing offensive in it , but it left me without anything to reply to .
Parsing [sent. 2110 len. 42]: No embarrassment followed , however , for a rustling motion in the room the same instant attracted my attention , and I saw , to my surprise , and I must confess , a little to my confusion , Miss Oldcastle .
Parsing [sent. 2111 len. 16]: She was seated in a corner , reading from a quarto lying upon her knees .
Parsing [sent. 2112 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 2113 len. 9]: you did n't know my niece was here ?
Parsing [sent. 2114 len. 22]: To tell the truth , I forgot her when I brought you up , else I would have introduced you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2115 len. 17]: `` That is not necessary , uncle , '' said Miss Oldcastle , closing her book .
Parsing [sent. 2116 len. 6]: I was by her instantly .
Parsing [sent. 2117 len. 14]: She slipped the quarto from her knee , and took my offered hand .
Parsing [sent. 2118 len. 9]: `` Are you fond of old books ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2119 len. 10]: I said , not having anything better to say .
Parsing [sent. 2120 len. 9]: `` Some old books , '' she answered .
Parsing [sent. 2121 len. 11]: `` May I ask what book you were reading ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2122 len. 17]: `` I will answer you -- under protest , '' she said , with a smile .
Parsing [sent. 2123 len. 12]: `` I withdraw the question at once , '' I returned .
Parsing [sent. 2124 len. 7]: `` I will answer it notwithstanding .
Parsing [sent. 2125 len. 9]: It is a volume of Jacob Behmen . ''
Parsing [sent. 2126 len. 7]: `` Do you understand him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2127 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 2128 len. 5]: Do n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2129 len. 14]: `` Well , I have made but little attempt , '' I answered .
Parsing [sent. 2130 len. 36]: `` Indeed , it was only as I passed through London last that I bought his works ; and I am sorry to find that one of the plates is missing from my copy . ''
Parsing [sent. 2131 len. 6]: `` Which plate is it ?
Parsing [sent. 2132 len. 15]: It is not very easy , I understand , to procure a perfect copy .
Parsing [sent. 2133 len. 13]: One of my uncle 's copies has no two volumes bound alike .
Parsing [sent. 2134 len. 10]: Each must have belonged to a different set . ''
Parsing [sent. 2135 len. 11]: `` I ca n't tell you what the plate is .
Parsing [sent. 2136 len. 23]: But there are only three of those very curious unfolding ones in my third volume , and there should be four . ''
Parsing [sent. 2137 len. 7]: `` I do not think so .
Parsing [sent. 2138 len. 10]: Indeed , I am sure you are wrong . ''
Parsing [sent. 2139 len. 45]: `` I am glad to hear it -- though to be glad that the world does not possess what I thought I only was deprived of , is selfishness , cover it over as one may with the fiction of a perfect copy . ''
Parsing [sent. 2140 len. 18]: `` I do n't know , '' she returned , without any response to what I said .
Parsing [sent. 2141 len. 10]: `` I should always like things perfect myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 2142 len. 16]: `` Doubtless , '' I answered ; and thought it better to try another direction .
Parsing [sent. 2143 len. 7]: `` How is Mrs Oldcastle ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2144 len. 56]: I asked , feeling in its turn the reproach of hypocrisy ; for though I could have suffered , I hope , in my person and goods and reputation , to make that woman other than she was , I could not say that I cared one atom whether she was in health or not .
Parsing [sent. 2145 len. 30]: Possibly I should have preferred the latter member of the alternative ; for the suffering of the lower nature is as a fire that drives the higher nature upwards .
Parsing [sent. 2146 len. 13]: So I felt rather hypocritical when I asked Miss Oldcastle after her .
Parsing [sent. 2147 len. 32]: `` Quite well , thank you , '' she answered , in a tone of indifference , which implied either that she saw through me , or shared in my indifference .
Parsing [sent. 2148 len. 6]: I could not tell which .
Parsing [sent. 2149 len. 8]: `` And how is Miss Judy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2150 len. 3]: I inquired .
Parsing [sent. 2151 len. 9]: `` A little savage , as usual . ''
Parsing [sent. 2152 len. 12]: `` Not the worse for her wetting , I hope . ''
Parsing [sent. 2153 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 2154 len. 3]: dear no .
Parsing [sent. 2155 len. 10]: There never was health to equal that child 's .
Parsing [sent. 2156 len. 8]: It belongs to her savage nature . ''
Parsing [sent. 2157 len. 31]: `` I wish some of us were more of savages , then , '' I returned ; for I saw signs of exhaustion in her eyes which moved my sympathy .
Parsing [sent. 2158 len. 13]: `` You do n't mean me , Mr Walton , I hope .
Parsing [sent. 2159 len. 15]: For if you do , I assure you your interest is quite thrown away .
Parsing [sent. 2160 len. 13]: Uncle will tell you I am as strong as an elephant . ''
Parsing [sent. 2161 len. 22]: But here came a slight elevation of her person ; and a shadow at the same moment passed over her face .
Parsing [sent. 2162 len. 19]: I saw that she felt she ought not to have allowed herself to become the subject of conversation .
Parsing [sent. 2163 len. 22]: Meantime her uncle was busy at one of his benches filing away at a piece of brass fixed in the vice .
Parsing [sent. 2164 len. 6]: He had thick gloves on .
Parsing [sent. 2165 len. 34]: And , indeed , it had puzzled me before to think how he could have so many kinds of work , and yet keep his hands so smooth and white as they were .
Parsing [sent. 2166 len. 31]: I could not help thinking the results could hardly be of the most useful description if they were all accomplished without some loss of whiteness and smoothness in the process .
Parsing [sent. 2167 len. 16]: Even the feet that keep the garments clean must be washed themselves in the end .
Parsing [sent. 2168 len. 26]: When I glanced away from Miss Oldcastle in the embarrassment produced by the repulsion of her last manner , I saw Judy in the room .
Parsing [sent. 2169 len. 8]: At the same moment Miss Oldcastle rose .
Parsing [sent. 2170 len. 9]: `` What is the matter , Judy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2171 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 2172 len. 9]: `` Grannie wants you , '' said Judy .
Parsing [sent. 2173 len. 12]: Miss Oldcastle left the room , and Judy turned to me .
Parsing [sent. 2174 len. 10]: `` How do you do , Mr Walton ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2175 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 2176 len. 13]: `` Quite well , thank you , Judy , '' I answered .
Parsing [sent. 2177 len. 12]: `` Your uncle admits you to his workshop , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2178 len. 5]: `` Yes , indeed .
Parsing [sent. 2179 len. 11]: He would feel rather dull , sometimes , without me .
Parsing [sent. 2180 len. 8]: Would n't you , Uncle Stoddart ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2181 len. 24]: `` Just as the horses in the field would feel dull without the gad-fly , Judy , '' said Mr Stoddart , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 2182 len. 33]: Judy , however , did not choose to receive the laugh as a scholium explanatory of the remark , and was gone in a moment , leaving Mr Stoddart and myself alone .
Parsing [sent. 2183 len. 47]: I must say he looked a little troubled at the precipitate retreat of the damsel ; but he recovered himself with a smile , and said to me , `` I wonder what speech I shall make next to drive you away , Mr Walton . ''
Parsing [sent. 2184 len. 17]: `` I am not so easily got rid of , Mr Stoddart , '' I answered .
Parsing [sent. 2185 len. 20]: `` And as for taking offence , I do n't like it , and therefore I never take it .
Parsing [sent. 2186 len. 10]: But tell me what you are doing now . ''
Parsing [sent. 2187 len. 37]: `` I have been working for some time at an attempt after a perpetual motion , but , I must confess , more from a metaphysical or logical point of view than a mechanical one . ''
Parsing [sent. 2188 len. 14]: Here he took a drawing from a shelf , explanatory of his plan .
Parsing [sent. 2189 len. 47]: `` You see , '' he said , `` here is a top made of platinum , the heaviest of metals , except iridium -- which it would be impossible to procure enough of , and which would be difficult to work into the proper shape .
Parsing [sent. 2190 len. 21]: It is surrounded you will observe , by an air-tight receiver , communicating by this tube with a powerful air-pump .
Parsing [sent. 2191 len. 33]: The plate upon which the point of the top rests and revolves is a diamond ; and I ought to have mentioned that the peg of the top is a diamond likewise .
Parsing [sent. 2192 len. 14]: This is , of course , for the sake of reducing the friction .
Parsing [sent. 2193 len. 28]: By this apparatus communicating with the top , through the receiver , I set the top in motion -- after exhausting the air as far as possible .
Parsing [sent. 2194 len. 23]: Still there is the difficulty of the friction of the diamond point upon the diamond plate , which must ultimately occasion repose .
Parsing [sent. 2195 len. 34]: To obviate this , I have constructed here , underneath , a small steam-engine which shall cause the diamond plate to revolve at precisely the same rate of speed as the top itself .
Parsing [sent. 2196 len. 11]: This , of course , will prevent all friction . ''
Parsing [sent. 2197 len. 18]: `` Not that with the unavoidable remnant of air , however , '' I ventured to suggest .
Parsing [sent. 2198 len. 12]: `` That is just my weak point , '' he answered .
Parsing [sent. 2199 len. 10]: `` But that will be so very small ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2200 len. 14]: `` Yes ; but enough to deprive the top of PERPETUAL motion . ''
Parsing [sent. 2201 len. 24]: `` But suppose I could get over that difficulty , would the contrivance have a right to the name of a perpetual motion ?
Parsing [sent. 2202 len. 16]: For you observe that the steam-engine below would not be the cause of the motion .
Parsing [sent. 2203 len. 15]: That comes from above , here , and is withdrawn , finally withdrawn . ''
Parsing [sent. 2204 len. 9]: `` I understand perfectly , '' I answered .
Parsing [sent. 2205 len. 9]: `` At least , I think I do .
Parsing [sent. 2206 len. 63]: But I return the question to you : Is a motion which , although not caused , is ENABLED by another motion , worthy of the name of a perpetual motion ; seeing the perpetuity of motion has not to do merely with time , but with the indwelling of self-generative power -- renewing itself constantly with the process of exhaustion ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2207 len. 9]: He threw down his file on the bench .
Parsing [sent. 2208 len. 11]: `` I fear you are right , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2209 len. 15]: `` But you will allow it would have made a very pretty machine . ''
Parsing [sent. 2210 len. 17]: `` Pretty , I will allow , '' I answered , `` as distinguished from beautiful .
Parsing [sent. 2211 len. 10]: For I can never dissociate beauty from use . ''
Parsing [sent. 2212 len. 5]: `` You say that !
Parsing [sent. 2213 len. 11]: with all the poetic things you say in your sermons !
Parsing [sent. 2214 len. 19]: For I am a sharp listener , and none the less such that you do not see me .
Parsing [sent. 2215 len. 8]: I have a loophole for seeing you .
Parsing [sent. 2216 len. 26]: And I flatter myself , therefore , I am the only person in the congregation on a level with you in respect of balancing advantages .
Parsing [sent. 2217 len. 14]: I can not contradict you , and you can not address me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2218 len. 15]: `` Do you mean , then , that whatever is poetical is useless ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2219 len. 3]: I asked .
Parsing [sent. 2220 len. 12]: `` Do you assert that whatever is useful is beautiful ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2221 len. 3]: he retorted .
Parsing [sent. 2222 len. 48]: `` A full reply to your question would need a ream of paper and a quarter of quills , '' I answered ; `` but I think I may venture so far as to say that whatever subserves a noble end must in itself be beautiful . ''
Parsing [sent. 2223 len. 21]: `` Then a gallows must be beautiful because it subserves the noble end of ridding the world of malefactors ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2224 len. 5]: he returned , promptly .
Parsing [sent. 2225 len. 12]: I had to think for a moment before I could reply .
Parsing [sent. 2226 len. 15]: `` I do not see anything noble in the end , '' I answered .
Parsing [sent. 2227 len. 19]: `` If the machine got rid of malefaction , it would , indeed , have a noble end .
Parsing [sent. 2228 len. 36]: But if it only compels it to move on , as a constable does -- from this world into another -- I do not , I say , see anything so noble in that end .
Parsing [sent. 2229 len. 8]: The gallows can not be beautiful . ''
Parsing [sent. 2230 len. 6]: `` Ah , I see .
Parsing [sent. 2231 len. 9]: You do n't approve of capital punishments . ''
Parsing [sent. 2232 len. 7]: `` I do not say that .
Parsing [sent. 2233 len. 12]: An inevitable necessity is something very different from a noble end .
Parsing [sent. 2234 len. 71]: To cure the diseased mind is the noblest of ends ; to make the sinner forsake his ways , and the unrighteous man his thoughts , the loftiest of designs ; but to punish him for being wrong , however necessary it may be for others , can not , if dissociated from the object of bringing good out of evil , be called in any sense a NOBLE end .
Parsing [sent. 2235 len. 22]: I think now , however , it would be but fair in you to give me some answer to my question .
Parsing [sent. 2236 len. 8]: Do you think the poetic useless ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2237 len. 10]: `` I think it is very like my machine .
Parsing [sent. 2238 len. 12]: It may exercise the faculties without subserving any immediate progress . ''
Parsing [sent. 2239 len. 30]: `` It is so difficult to get out of the region of the poetic , that I can not think it other than useful : it is so widespread .
Parsing [sent. 2240 len. 9]: The useless could hardly be so nearly universal .
Parsing [sent. 2241 len. 23]: But I should like to ask you another question : What is the immediate effect of anything poetic upon your mind ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2242 len. 7]: `` Pleasure , '' he answered .
Parsing [sent. 2243 len. 9]: `` And is pleasure good or bad ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2244 len. 10]: `` Sometimes the one , sometimes the other . ''
Parsing [sent. 2245 len. 5]: `` In itself ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2246 len. 7]: `` I should say so . ''
Parsing [sent. 2247 len. 6]: `` I should not . ''
Parsing [sent. 2248 len. 21]: `` Are you not , then , by your very profession , more or less an enemy of pleasure ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2249 len. 21]: `` On the contrary , I believe that pleasure is good , and does good , and urges to good .
Parsing [sent. 2250 len. 7]: CARE is the evil thing . ''
Parsing [sent. 2251 len. 8]: `` Strange doctrine for a clergyman . ''
Parsing [sent. 2252 len. 11]: `` Now , do not misunderstand me , Mr Stoddart .
Parsing [sent. 2253 len. 12]: That might not hurt you , but it would distress me .
Parsing [sent. 2254 len. 11]: Pleasure , obtained by wrong , is poison and horror .
Parsing [sent. 2255 len. 31]: But it is not the pleasure that hurts , it is the wrong that is in it that hurts ; the pleasure hurts only as it leads to more wrong .
Parsing [sent. 2256 len. 23]: I almost think myself , that if you could make everybody happy , half the evil would vanish from the earth . ''
Parsing [sent. 2257 len. 8]: `` But you believe in God ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2258 len. 9]: `` I hope in God I do . ''
Parsing [sent. 2259 len. 21]: `` How can you then think that He would not destroy evil at such a cheap and pleasant rate . ''
Parsing [sent. 2260 len. 44]: `` Because He wants to destroy ALL the evil , not the half of it ; and destroy it so that it shall not grow again ; which it would be sure to do very soon if it had no antidote but happiness .
Parsing [sent. 2261 len. 22]: As soon as men got used to happiness , they would begin to sin again , and so lose it all .
Parsing [sent. 2262 len. 5]: But care is distrust .
Parsing [sent. 2263 len. 19]: I wonder now if ever there was a man who did his duty , and TOOK NO THOUGHT .
Parsing [sent. 2264 len. 12]: I wish I could get the testimony of such a man .
Parsing [sent. 2265 len. 8]: Has anybody actually tried the plan ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2266 len. 21]: But here I saw that I was not taking Mr Stoddart with me -LRB- as the old phrase was -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 2267 len. 17]: The reason I supposed to be , that he had never been troubled with much care .
Parsing [sent. 2268 len. 15]: But there remained the question , whether he trusted in God or the Bank ?
Parsing [sent. 2269 len. 8]: I went back to the original question .
Parsing [sent. 2270 len. 26]: `` But I should be very sorry you should think , that to give pleasure was my object in saying poetic things in the pulpit .
Parsing [sent. 2271 len. 21]: If I do so , it is because true things come to me in their natural garments of poetic forms .
Parsing [sent. 2272 len. 48]: What you call the POETIC is only the outer beauty that belongs to all inner or spiritual beauty -- just as a lovely face -- mind , I say LOVELY , not PRETTY , not HANDSOME -- is the outward and visible presence of a lovely mind .
Parsing [sent. 2273 len. 54]: Therefore , saying I can not dissociate beauty from use , I am free to say as many poetic things -- though , mind , I do n't claim them : you attribute them to me -- as shall be of the highest use , namely , to embody and reveal the true .
Parsing [sent. 2274 len. 10]: But a machine has material use for its end .
Parsing [sent. 2275 len. 42]: The most grotesque machine I ever saw that DID something , I felt to be in its own kind beautiful ; as God called many fierce and grotesque things good when He made the world -- good for their good end .
Parsing [sent. 2276 len. 28]: But your machine does nothing more than raise the metaphysical doubt and question , whether it can with propriety be called a perpetual motion or not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2277 len. 49]: To this Mr Stoddart making no reply , I take the opportunity of the break in our conversation to say to my readers , that I know there was no satisfactory following out of an argument on either side in the passage of words I have just given .
Parsing [sent. 2278 len. 69]: Even the closest reasoner finds it next to impossible to attend to all the suggestions in his own mind , not one of which he is willing to lose , to attend at the same time to everything his antagonist says or suggests , that he may do him justice , and to keep an even course towards his goal -- each having the opposite goal in view .
Parsing [sent. 2279 len. 53]: In fact , an argument , however simply conducted and honourable , must just resemble a game at football ; the unfortunate question being the ball , and the numerous and sometimes conflicting thoughts which arise in each mind forming the two parties whose energies are spent in a succession of kicks .
Parsing [sent. 2280 len. 18]: In fact , I do n't like argument , and I do n't care for the victory .
Parsing [sent. 2281 len. 13]: If I had my way , I would never argue at all .
Parsing [sent. 2282 len. 95]: I would spend my energy in setting forth what I believe -- as like itself as I could represent it , and so leave it to work its own way , which , if it be the right way , it must work in the right mind , -- for Wisdom is justified of her children ; while no one who loves the truth can be other than anxious , that if he has spoken the evil thing it may return to him void : that is a defeat he may well pray for .
Parsing [sent. 2283 len. 22]: To succeed in the wrong is the most dreadful punishment to a man who , in the main , is honest .
Parsing [sent. 2284 len. 50]: But I beg to assure my reader I could write a long treatise on the matter between Mr Stoddart and myself ; therefore , if he is not yet interested in such questions , let him be thankful to me for considering such a treatise out of place here .
Parsing [sent. 2285 len. 31]: I will only say in brief , that I believe with all my heart that the true is the beautiful , and that nothing evil can be other than ugly .
Parsing [sent. 2286 len. 30]: If it seems not so , it is in virtue of some good mingled with the evil , and not in the smallest degree in virtue of the evil .
Parsing [sent. 2287 len. 12]: I thought it was time for me to take my leave .
Parsing [sent. 2288 len. 36]: But I could not bear to run away with the last word , as it were : so I said , `` You put plenty of poetry yourself into that voluntary you played last Sunday .
Parsing [sent. 2289 len. 11]: I am so much obliged to you for it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2290 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 2291 len. 3]: that fugue .
Parsing [sent. 2292 len. 8]: You liked it , did you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2293 len. 9]: `` More than I can tell you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2294 len. 7]: `` I am very glad . ''
Parsing [sent. 2295 len. 21]: `` Do you know those two lines of Milton in which he describes such a performance on the organ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2296 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 2297 len. 7]: Can you repeat them ? '' ''
Parsing [sent. 2298 len. 24]: ` His volant touch , Instinct through all proportions , low and high , Fled and pursued transverse the resonant fugue . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 2299 len. 6]: `` That is wonderfully fine .
Parsing [sent. 2300 len. 3]: Thank you .
Parsing [sent. 2301 len. 11]: That is better than my fugue by a good deal .
Parsing [sent. 2302 len. 7]: You have cancelled the obligation . ''
Parsing [sent. 2303 len. 14]: `` Do you think doing a good turn again is cancelling an obligation ?
Parsing [sent. 2304 len. 19]: I do n't think an obligation can ever be RETURNED in the sense of being got rid of .
Parsing [sent. 2305 len. 7]: But I am being hypercritical . ''
Parsing [sent. 2306 len. 5]: `` Not at all .
Parsing [sent. 2307 len. 16]: -- Shall I tell you what I was thinking of while playing that fugue ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2308 len. 9]: `` I should like much to hear . ''
Parsing [sent. 2309 len. 55]: `` I had been thinking , while you were preaching , of the many fancies men had worshipped for the truth ; now following this , now following that ; ever believing they were on the point of laying hold upon her , and going down to the grave empty-handed as they came . ''
Parsing [sent. 2310 len. 7]: `` And empty-hearted , too ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2311 len. 11]: I asked ; but he went on without heeding me .
Parsing [sent. 2312 len. 63]: `` And I saw a vision of multitudes following , following where nothing was to be seen , with arms outstretched in all directions , some clasping vacancy to their bosoms , some reaching on tiptoe over the heads of their neighbours , and some with hanging heads , and hands clasped behind their backs , retiring hopeless from the chase . ''
Parsing [sent. 2313 len. 4]: `` Strange ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2314 len. 28]: I said ; `` for I felt so full of hope while you played , that I never doubted it was hope you meant to express . ''
Parsing [sent. 2315 len. 27]: `` So I do not doubt I did ; for the multitude was full of hope , vain hope , to lay hold upon the truth .
Parsing [sent. 2316 len. 37]: And you , being full of the main expression , and in sympathy with it , did not heed the undertones of disappointment , or the sighs of those who turned their backs on the chase .
Parsing [sent. 2317 len. 8]: Just so it is in life . ''
Parsing [sent. 2318 len. 21]: `` I am no musician , '' I returned , `` to give you a musical counter to your picture .
Parsing [sent. 2319 len. 43]: But I see a grave man tilling the ground in peace , and the form of Truth standing behind him , and folding her wings closer and closer over and around him as he works on at his day 's labour . ''
Parsing [sent. 2320 len. 14]: `` Very pretty , '' said Mr Stoddart , and said no more .
Parsing [sent. 2321 len. 42]: `` Suppose , '' I went on , `` that a person knows that he has not laid hold on the truth , is that sufficient ground for his making any further assertion than that he has not found it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2322 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 2323 len. 33]: But if he has tried hard and has not found ANYTHING that he can say is true , he can not help thinking that most likely there is no such thing . ''
Parsing [sent. 2324 len. 28]: `` Suppose , '' I said , `` that nobody has found the truth , is that sufficient ground for saying that nobody ever will find it ?
Parsing [sent. 2325 len. 13]: or that there is no such thing as truth to be found ?
Parsing [sent. 2326 len. 12]: Are the ages so nearly done that no chance yet remains ?
Parsing [sent. 2327 len. 25]: Surely if God has made us to desire the truth , He has got some truth to cast into the gulf of that desire .
Parsing [sent. 2328 len. 8]: Shall God create hunger and no food ?
Parsing [sent. 2329 len. 13]: But possibly a man may be looking the wrong way for it .
Parsing [sent. 2330 len. 20]: You may be using the microscope , when you ought to open both eyes and lift up your head .
Parsing [sent. 2331 len. 24]: Or a man may be finding some truth which is feeding his soul , when he does not think he is finding any .
Parsing [sent. 2332 len. 6]: You know the Fairy Queen .
Parsing [sent. 2333 len. 35]: Think how long the Redcross Knight travelled with the Lady Truth -- Una , you know -- without learning to believe in her ; and how much longer still without ever seeing her face .
Parsing [sent. 2334 len. 15]: For my part , may God give me strength to follow till I die .
Parsing [sent. 2335 len. 26]: Only I will venture to say this , that it is not by any agony of the intellect that I expect to discover her . ''
Parsing [sent. 2336 len. 26]: Mr Stoddart sat drumming silently with his fingers , a half-smile on his face , and his eyes raised at an angle of forty-five degrees .
Parsing [sent. 2337 len. 16]: I felt that the enthusiasm with which I had spoken was thrown away upon him .
Parsing [sent. 2338 len. 10]: But I was not going to be ashamed therefore .
Parsing [sent. 2339 len. 10]: I would put some faith in his best nature .
Parsing [sent. 2340 len. 42]: `` But does not , '' he said , gently lowering his eyes upon mine after a moment 's pause -- `` does not your choice of a profession imply that you have not to give chase to a fleeting phantom ?
Parsing [sent. 2341 len. 17]: Do you not profess to have , and hold , and therefore teach the truth ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2342 len. 28]: `` I profess only to have caught glimpses of her white garments , -- those , I mean , of the abstract truth of which you speak .
Parsing [sent. 2343 len. 81]: But I have seen that which is eternally beyond her : the ideal in the real , the living truth , not the truth that I can THINK , but the truth that thinks itself , that thinks me , that God has thought , yea , that God is , the truth BEING true to itself and to God and to man -- Christ Jesus , my Lord , who knows , and feels , and does the truth .
Parsing [sent. 2344 len. 13]: I have seen Him , and I am both content and unsatisfied .
Parsing [sent. 2345 len. 13]: For in Him are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge .
Parsing [sent. 2346 len. 19]: Thomas a Kempis says : ` Cui aeternum Verbum loquitur , ille a multis opinionibus expeditur . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 2347 len. 19]: -LRB- He to whom the eternal Word speaks , is set free from a press of opinions . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 2348 len. 12]: I rose , and held out my hand to Mr Stoddart .
Parsing [sent. 2349 len. 30]: He rose likewise , and took it kindly , conducted me to the room below , and ringing the bell , committed me to the care of the butler .
Parsing [sent. 2350 len. 16]: As I approached the gate , I met Jane Rogers coming back from the village .
Parsing [sent. 2351 len. 7]: I stopped and spoke to her .
Parsing [sent. 2352 len. 6]: Her eyes were very red .
Parsing [sent. 2353 len. 9]: `` Nothing amiss at home , Jane ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2354 len. 3]: I said .
Parsing [sent. 2355 len. 17]: `` No , sir , thank you , '' answered Jane , and burst out crying .
Parsing [sent. 2356 len. 8]: `` What is the matter , then ?
Parsing [sent. 2357 len. 15]: Is your -- '' `` Nothing 's the matter with nobody , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 2358 len. 9]: `` Something is the matter with you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2359 len. 5]: `` Yes , sir .
Parsing [sent. 2360 len. 7]: But I 'm quite well . ''
Parsing [sent. 2361 len. 31]: `` I do n't want to pry into your affairs ; but if you think I can be of any use to you , mind you come to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2362 len. 23]: `` Thank you kindly , sir , '' said Jane ; and , dropping a courtesy , walked on with her basket .
Parsing [sent. 2363 len. 8]: I went to her parents ' cottage .
Parsing [sent. 2364 len. 32]: As I came near the mill , the young miller was standing in the door with his eyes fixed on the ground , while the mill went on hopping behind him .
Parsing [sent. 2365 len. 23]: But when he caught sight of me , he turned , and went in , as if he had not seen me .
Parsing [sent. 2366 len. 10]: `` Has he been behaving ill to Jane ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2367 len. 3]: thought I .
Parsing [sent. 2368 len. 45]: As he evidently wished to avoid me , I passed the mill without looking in at the door , as I was in the habit of doing , and went on to the cottage , where I lifted the latch , and walked in .
Parsing [sent. 2369 len. 21]: Both the old people were there , and both looked troubled , though they welcomed me none the less kindly .
Parsing [sent. 2370 len. 27]: `` I met Jane , '' I said , `` and she looked unhappy ; so I came on to hear what was the matter . ''
Parsing [sent. 2371 len. 17]: `` You ought n't to be troubled with our small affairs , '' said Mrs. Rogers .
Parsing [sent. 2372 len. 38]: `` If the parson wants to know , why , the parson must be told , '' said Old Rogers , smiling cheerily , as if he , at least , would be relieved by telling me .
Parsing [sent. 2373 len. 22]: `` I do n't want to know , '' I said , `` if you do n't want to tell me .
Parsing [sent. 2374 len. 9]: But can I be of any use ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2375 len. 24]: `` I do n't think you can , sir , -- leastways , I 'm afraid not , '' said the old woman .
Parsing [sent. 2376 len. 44]: `` I am sorry to say , sir , that Master Brownrigg and his son has come to words about our Jane ; and it 's not agreeable to have folk 's daughter quarrelled over in that way , '' said Old Rogers .
Parsing [sent. 2377 len. 20]: `` What 'll be the upshot on it , I do n't know , but it looks bad now .
Parsing [sent. 2378 len. 36]: For the father he tells the son that if ever he hear of him saying one word to our Jane , out of the mill he goes , as sure as his name 's Dick .
Parsing [sent. 2379 len. 24]: Now , it 's rather a good chance , I think , to see what the young fellow 's made of , sir .
Parsing [sent. 2380 len. 15]: So I tells my old ` oman here ; and so I told Jane .
Parsing [sent. 2381 len. 13]: But neither on 'em seems to see the comfort of it somehow .
Parsing [sent. 2382 len. 21]: But the New Testament do say a man shall leave father and mother , and cleave to his wife . ''
Parsing [sent. 2383 len. 24]: `` But she ai n't his wife yet , '' said Mrs Rogers to her husband , whose drift was not yet evident .
Parsing [sent. 2384 len. 17]: `` No more she can be , ` cept he leaves his father for her . ''
Parsing [sent. 2385 len. 14]: `` And what 'll become of them then , without the mill ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2386 len. 36]: `` You and me never had no mill , old ` oman , '' said Rogers ; `` yet here we be , very nearly ripe now , -- ai n't us , wife ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2387 len. 29]: `` Medlar-like , Old Rogers , I doubt , -- rotten before we 're ripe , '' replied his wife , quoting a more humorous than refined proverb .
Parsing [sent. 2388 len. 9]: `` Nay , nay , old ` oman .
Parsing [sent. 2389 len. 7]: Do n't ' e say so .
Parsing [sent. 2390 len. 14]: The Lord wo n't let us rot before we 're ripe , anyhow .
Parsing [sent. 2391 len. 7]: That I be sure on . ''
Parsing [sent. 2392 len. 13]: `` But , anyhow , it 's ail very well to talk .
Parsing [sent. 2393 len. 8]: Thou knows how to talk , Rogers .
Parsing [sent. 2394 len. 15]: But how will it be when the children comes , and no mill ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2395 len. 11]: `` To grind 'em in , old ` oman ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2396 len. 17]: Mrs Rogers turned to me , who was listening with real interest , and much amusement .
Parsing [sent. 2397 len. 14]: `` I wish you would speak a word to Old Rogers , sir .
Parsing [sent. 2398 len. 10]: He never will speak as he 's spoken to .
Parsing [sent. 2399 len. 10]: He 's always over merry , or over serious .
Parsing [sent. 2400 len. 27]: He either takes me up short with a sermon , or he laughs me out of countenance that I do n't know where to look . ''
Parsing [sent. 2401 len. 74]: Now I was pretty sure that Rogers 's conduct was simple consistency , and that the difficulty arose from his always acting upon one or two of the plainest principles of truth and right ; whereas his wife , good woman -- for the bad , old leaven of the Pharisees could not rise much in her somehow -- was always reminding him of certain precepts of behaviour to the oblivion of principles .
Parsing [sent. 2402 len. 54]: `` A bird in the hand , '' & c. -- `` Marry in haste , '' & c. -- `` When want comes in at the door love flies out at the window , '' were amongst her favourite sayings ; although not one of them was supported by her own experience .
Parsing [sent. 2403 len. 38]: For instance , she had married in haste herself , and never , I believe , had once thought of repenting of it , although she had had far more than the requisite leisure for doing so .
Parsing [sent. 2404 len. 41]: And many was the time that want had come in at her door , and the first thing it always did was to clip the wings of Love , and make him less flighty , and more tender and serviceable .
Parsing [sent. 2405 len. 13]: So I could not even pretend to read her husband a lecture .
Parsing [sent. 2406 len. 14]: `` He 's a curious man , Old Rogers , '' I said .
Parsing [sent. 2407 len. 19]: `` But as far as I can see , he 's in the right , in the main .
Parsing [sent. 2408 len. 6]: Is n't he now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2409 len. 8]: `` Oh , yes , I daresay .
Parsing [sent. 2410 len. 16]: I think he 's always right about the rights of the thing , you know .
Parsing [sent. 2411 len. 10]: But a body may go too far that way .
Parsing [sent. 2412 len. 10]: It wo n't do to starve , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 2413 len. 12]: Strange confusion -- or , ought I not rather to say ?
Parsing [sent. 2414 len. 8]: -- ordinary and commonplace confusion of ideas !
Parsing [sent. 2415 len. 23]: `` I do n't think , '' I said , `` any one can go too far in the right way . ''
Parsing [sent. 2416 len. 25]: `` That 's just what I want my old ` oman to see , and I ca n't get it into her , sir .
Parsing [sent. 2417 len. 23]: If a thing 's right , it 's right , and if a thing 's wrong , why , wrong it is .
Parsing [sent. 2418 len. 13]: The helm must either be to starboard or port , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 2419 len. 8]: `` But why talk of starving ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2420 len. 3]: I said .
Parsing [sent. 2421 len. 6]: `` Ca n't Dick work ?
Parsing [sent. 2422 len. 9]: Who could think of starting that nonsense ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2423 len. 9]: `` Why , my old ` oman here .
Parsing [sent. 2424 len. 14]: She wants 'em to give it up , and wait for better times .
Parsing [sent. 2425 len. 14]: The fact is , she do n't want to lose the girl . ''
Parsing [sent. 2426 len. 12]: `` But she has n't got her at home now . ''
Parsing [sent. 2427 len. 19]: `` She can have her when she wants her , though -- leastways after a bit of warning .
Parsing [sent. 2428 len. 41]: Whereas , if she was married , and the consequences a follerin ' at her heels , like a man-o ' - war with her convoy , she would find she was chartered for another port , she would . ''
Parsing [sent. 2429 len. 31]: `` Well , you see , sir , Rogers and me 's not so young as we once was , and we 're likely to be growing older every day .
Parsing [sent. 2430 len. 24]: And if there 's a difficulty in the way of Jane 's marriage , why , I take it as a Godsend . ''
Parsing [sent. 2431 len. 25]: `` How would you have liked such a Godsend , Mrs Rogers , when you were going to be married to your sailor here ?
Parsing [sent. 2432 len. 7]: What would you have done ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2433 len. 10]: `` Why , whatever he liked to be sure .
Parsing [sent. 2434 len. 13]: But then , you see , Dick 's not my Rogers . ''
Parsing [sent. 2435 len. 27]: `` But your daughter thinks about him much in the same way as you did about this dear old man here when he was young . ''
Parsing [sent. 2436 len. 19]: `` Young people may be in the wrong , _ I _ see nothing in Dick Brownrigg . ''
Parsing [sent. 2437 len. 18]: `` But young people may be right sometimes , and old people may be wrong sometimes . ''
Parsing [sent. 2438 len. 10]: `` I ca n't be wrong about Rogers . ''
Parsing [sent. 2439 len. 12]: `` No , but you may be wrong about Dick . ''
Parsing [sent. 2440 len. 14]: `` Do n't you trouble yourself about my old ` oman , sir .
Parsing [sent. 2441 len. 16]: She allus was awk ` ard in stays , but she never missed them yet .
Parsing [sent. 2442 len. 20]: When she 's said her say , round she comes in the wind like a bird , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 2443 len. 15]: `` There 's a good old man to stick up for your old wife !
Parsing [sent. 2444 len. 13]: Still , I say , they may as well wait a bit .
Parsing [sent. 2445 len. 12]: It would be a pity to anger the old gentleman . ''
Parsing [sent. 2446 len. 11]: `` What does the young man say to it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2447 len. 31]: `` Why , he says , like a man , he can work for her as well 's the mill , and he 's ready , if she is . ''
Parsing [sent. 2448 len. 14]: `` I am very glad to hear such a good account of him .
Parsing [sent. 2449 len. 13]: I shall look in , and have a little chat with him .
Parsing [sent. 2450 len. 8]: I always liked the look of him .
Parsing [sent. 2451 len. 7]: Good morning , Mrs. Rogers . ''
Parsing [sent. 2452 len. 24]: `` I 'll see you across the stream , sir , '' said the old man , following me out of the house .
Parsing [sent. 2453 len. 32]: `` You see , sir , '' he resumed , as soon as we were outside , `` I 'm always afeard of taking things out of the Lord 's hands .
Parsing [sent. 2454 len. 35]: It 's the right way , surely , that when a man loves a woman , and has told her so , he should act like a man , and do as is right .
Parsing [sent. 2455 len. 9]: And is n't that the Lord 's way ?
Parsing [sent. 2456 len. 12]: And ca n't He give them what 's good for them .
Parsing [sent. 2457 len. 38]: Mayhap they wo n't love each other the less in the end if Dick has a little bit of the hard work that many a man that the Lord loved none the less has had before him .
Parsing [sent. 2458 len. 28]: I would n't like to anger the old gentleman , as my wife says ; but if I was Dick , I know what I would do .
Parsing [sent. 2459 len. 25]: But do n't ' e think hard of my wife , sir , for I believe there 's a bit of pride in it .
Parsing [sent. 2460 len. 24]: She 's afeard of bein ' supposed to catch at Richard Brownrigg , because he 's above us , you know , sir .
Parsing [sent. 2461 len. 29]: And I ca n't altogether blame her , only we ai n't got to do with the look o ' things , but with the things themselves . ''
Parsing [sent. 2462 len. 15]: `` I understand you quite , and I 'm very much of your mind .
Parsing [sent. 2463 len. 17]: You can trust me to have a little chat with him , ca n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2464 len. 8]: `` That I can , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 2465 len. 71]: Here we had come to the boundary of his garden -- the busy stream that ran away , as if it was scared at the labour it had been compelled to go through , and was now making the best of its speed back to its mother-ocean , to tell sad tales of a world where every little brook must do some work ere it gets back to its rest .
Parsing [sent. 2466 len. 46]: I bade him good day , jumped across it , and went into the mill , where Richard was tying the mouth of a sack , as gloomily as the brothers of Joseph must have tied their sacks after his silver cup had been found .
Parsing [sent. 2467 len. 18]: `` Why did you turn away from me , as I passed half-an-hour ago , Richard ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2468 len. 5]: I said , cheerily .
Parsing [sent. 2469 len. 8]: `` I beg your pardon , sir .
Parsing [sent. 2470 len. 9]: I did n't think you saw me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2471 len. 7]: `` But supposing I had n't ?
Parsing [sent. 2472 len. 8]: -- But I wo n't tease you .
Parsing [sent. 2473 len. 6]: I know all about it .
Parsing [sent. 2474 len. 8]: Can I do anything for you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2475 len. 5]: `` No , sir .
Parsing [sent. 2476 len. 7]: You ca n't move my father .
Parsing [sent. 2477 len. 8]: It 's no use talking to him .
Parsing [sent. 2478 len. 8]: He never hears a word anybody says .
Parsing [sent. 2479 len. 13]: He never hears a word you say o ' Sundays , sir .
Parsing [sent. 2480 len. 15]: He wo n't even believe the Mark Lane Express about the price of corn .
Parsing [sent. 2481 len. 11]: It 's no use talking to him , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 2482 len. 12]: `` You would n't mind if I were to try ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2483 len. 5]: `` No , sir .
Parsing [sent. 2484 len. 7]: You ca n't make matters worse .
Parsing [sent. 2485 len. 12]: No more can you make them any better , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 2486 len. 25]: `` I do n't say I shall talk to him ; but I may try it , if I find a fitting opportunity . ''
Parsing [sent. 2487 len. 20]: `` He 's always worse -- more obstinate , that is , when he 's in a good temper .
Parsing [sent. 2488 len. 8]: So you may choose your opportunity wrong .
Parsing [sent. 2489 len. 7]: But it 's all the same .
Parsing [sent. 2490 len. 7]: It can make no difference . ''
Parsing [sent. 2491 len. 11]: `` What are you going to do , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2492 len. 9]: `` I would let him do his worst .
Parsing [sent. 2493 len. 11]: But Jane does n't like to go against her mother .
Parsing [sent. 2494 len. 19]: I 'm sure I ca n't think how she should side with my father against both of us .
Parsing [sent. 2495 len. 14]: He never laid her under any such obligation , I 'm sure . ''
Parsing [sent. 2496 len. 13]: `` There may be more ways than one of accounting for that .
Parsing [sent. 2497 len. 15]: You must mind , however , and not be too hard upon your father .
Parsing [sent. 2498 len. 22]: You 're quite right in holding fast to the girl ; but mind that vexation does not make you unjust . ''
Parsing [sent. 2499 len. 8]: `` I wish my mother were alive .
Parsing [sent. 2500 len. 11]: She was the only one that ever could manage him .
Parsing [sent. 2501 len. 20]: How she contrived to do it nobody could think ; but manage him she did , somehow or other .
Parsing [sent. 2502 len. 13]: There 's not a husk of use in talking to HIM . ''
Parsing [sent. 2503 len. 13]: `` I daresay he prides himself on not being moved by talk .
Parsing [sent. 2504 len. 22]: But has he ever had a chance of knowing Jane -- of seeing what kind of a girl she is ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2505 len. 10]: `` He 's seen her over and over . ''
Parsing [sent. 2506 len. 9]: `` But seeing is n't always believing . ''
Parsing [sent. 2507 len. 9]: `` It certainly is n't with him . ''
Parsing [sent. 2508 len. 8]: `` If he could only know her !
Parsing [sent. 2509 len. 10]: But do n't you be too hard upon him .
Parsing [sent. 2510 len. 9]: And do n't do anything in a hurry .
Parsing [sent. 2511 len. 9]: Give him a little time , you know .
Parsing [sent. 2512 len. 15]: Mrs Rogers wo n't interfere between you and Jane , I am pretty sure .
Parsing [sent. 2513 len. 9]: But do n't push matters till we see .
Parsing [sent. 2514 len. 3]: Good-bye . ''
Parsing [sent. 2515 len. 10]: `` Good-bye , and thank you kindly , sir .
Parsing [sent. 2516 len. 12]: -- Ai n't I to see Jane in the meantime ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2517 len. 12]: `` If I were you , I would make no difference .
Parsing [sent. 2518 len. 18]: See her as often as you used , which I suppose was as often as you could .
Parsing [sent. 2519 len. 14]: I do n't think , I say , that her mother will interfere .
Parsing [sent. 2520 len. 9]: Her father is all on your side . ''
Parsing [sent. 2521 len. 22]: I called on Mr Brownrigg ; but , as his son had forewarned me , I could make nothing of him .
Parsing [sent. 2522 len. 28]: He did n't see , when the mill was his property , and Dick was his son , why he should n't have his way with them .
Parsing [sent. 2523 len. 11]: And he was going to have his way with them .
Parsing [sent. 2524 len. 22]: His son might marry any lady in the land ; and he was n't going to throw himself away that way .
Parsing [sent. 2525 len. 13]: I will not weary my readers with the conversation we had together .
Parsing [sent. 2526 len. 26]: All my missiles of argument were lost as it were in a bank of mud , the weight and resistance of which they only increased .
Parsing [sent. 2527 len. 38]: My experience in the attempt , however , did a little to reconcile me to his going to sleep in church ; for I saw that it could make little difference whether he was asleep or awake .
Parsing [sent. 2528 len. 24]: He , and not Mr. Stoddart in his organ sentry-box , was the only person whom it was absolutely impossible to preach to .
Parsing [sent. 2529 len. 10]: You might preach AT him ; but TO him ?
Parsing [sent. 2530 len. 3]: -- no .
Parsing [sent. 2531 len. 6]: CHAPTER X. MY CHRISTMAS PARTY .
Parsing [sent. 2532 len. 44]: As Christmas Day drew nearer and nearer , my heart glowed with the more gladness ; and the question came more and more pressingly -- Could I not do something to make it more really a holiday of the Church for my parishioners ?
Parsing [sent. 2533 len. 50]: That most of them would have a little more enjoyment on it than they had had all the year through , I had ground to hope ; but I wanted to connect this gladness -- in their minds , I mean , for who could dissever them in fact ?
Parsing [sent. 2534 len. 28]: -- with its source , the love of God , that love manifested unto men in the birth of the Human Babe , the Son of Man .
Parsing [sent. 2535 len. 12]: But I would not interfere with the Christmas Day at home .
Parsing [sent. 2536 len. 21]: I resolved to invite as many of my parishioners as would come , to spend Christmas Eve at the Vicarage .
Parsing [sent. 2537 len. 35]: I therefore had a notice to that purport affixed to the church door ; and resolved to send out no personal invitations whatever , so that I might not give offence by accidental omission .
Parsing [sent. 2538 len. 15]: The only person thrown into perplexity by this mode of proceeding was Mrs. Pearson .
Parsing [sent. 2539 len. 12]: `` How many am I to provide for , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2540 len. 8]: she said , with an injured air .
Parsing [sent. 2541 len. 18]: `` For as many as you ever saw in church at one time , '' I said .
Parsing [sent. 2542 len. 15]: `` And if there should be too much , why so much the better .
Parsing [sent. 2543 len. 17]: It can go to make Christmas Day the merrier at some of the poorer houses . ''
Parsing [sent. 2544 len. 13]: She looked discomposed , for she was not of an easy temper .
Parsing [sent. 2545 len. 16]: But she never ACTED from her temper ; she only LOOKED or SPOKE from it .
Parsing [sent. 2546 len. 13]: `` I shall want help , '' she said , at length .
Parsing [sent. 2547 len. 10]: `` As much as you like , Mrs. Pearson .
Parsing [sent. 2548 len. 7]: I can trust you entirely . ''
Parsing [sent. 2549 len. 16]: Her face brightened ; and the end showed that I had not trusted her amiss .
Parsing [sent. 2550 len. 25]: I was a little anxious about the result of the invitation -- partly as indicating the amount of confidence my people placed in me .
Parsing [sent. 2551 len. 29]: But although no one said a word to me about it beforehand except Old Rogers , as soon as the hour arrived , the people began to come .
Parsing [sent. 2552 len. 9]: And the first I welcomed was Mr. Brownrigg .
Parsing [sent. 2553 len. 14]: I had had all the rooms on the ground-floor prepared for their reception .
Parsing [sent. 2554 len. 12]: Tables of provision were set out in every one of them .
Parsing [sent. 2555 len. 33]: My visitors had tea or coffee , with plenty of bread and butter , when they arrived ; and the more solid supplies were reserved for a later part of the evening .
Parsing [sent. 2556 len. 9]: I soon found myself with enough to do .
Parsing [sent. 2557 len. 11]: But before long , I had a very efficient staff .
Parsing [sent. 2558 len. 128]: For after having had occasion , once or twice , to mention something of my plans for the evening , I found my labours gradually diminish , and yet everything seemed to go right ; the fact being that good Mr Boulderstone , in one part , had cast himself into the middle of the flood , and stood there immovable both in face and person , turning its waters into the right channel , namely , towards the barn , which I had fitted up for their reception in a body ; while in another quarter , namely , in the barn , Dr Duncan was doing his best , and that was simply something first-rate , to entertain the people till all should be ready .
Parsing [sent. 2559 len. 27]: From a kind of instinct these gentlemen had taken upon them to be my staff , almost without knowing it , and very grateful I was .
Parsing [sent. 2560 len. 33]: I found , too , that they soon gathered some of the young and more active spirits about them , whom they employed in various ways for the good of the community .
Parsing [sent. 2561 len. 65]: When I came in and saw the goodly assemblage , for I had been busy receiving them in the house , I could not help rejoicing that my predecessor had been so fond of farming that he had rented land in the neighbourhood of the vicarage , and built this large barn , of which I could make a hall to entertain my friends .
Parsing [sent. 2562 len. 36]: The night was frosty -- the stars shining brilliantly overhead -- so that , especially for country people , there was little danger in the short passage to be made to it from the house .
Parsing [sent. 2563 len. 16]: But , if necessary , I resolved to have a covered-way built before next time .
Parsing [sent. 2564 len. 19]: For how can a man be THE PERSON of a parish , if he never entertains his parishioners ?
Parsing [sent. 2565 len. 61]: And really , though it was lighted only with candles round the walls , and I had not been able to do much for the decoration of the place , I thought it looked very well , and my heart was glad that Christmas Eve -- just as if the Babe had been coming again to us that same night .
Parsing [sent. 2566 len. 22]: And is He not always coming to us afresh in every childlike feeling that awakes in the hearts of His people ?
Parsing [sent. 2567 len. 24]: I walked about amongst them , greeting them , and greeted everywhere in turn with kind smiles and hearty shakes of the hand .
Parsing [sent. 2568 len. 43]: As often as I paused in my communications for a moment , it was amusing to watch Mr. Boulderstone 's honest , though awkward endeavours to be at ease with his inferiors ; but Dr Duncan was just a sight worth seeing .
Parsing [sent. 2569 len. 30]: Very tall and very stately , he was talking now to this old man , now to that young woman , and every face glistened towards which he turned .
Parsing [sent. 2570 len. 7]: There was no condescension about him .
Parsing [sent. 2571 len. 31]: He was as polite and courteous to one as to another , and the smile that every now and then lighted up his old face , was genuine and sympathetic .
Parsing [sent. 2572 len. 15]: No one could have known by his behaviour that he was not at court .
Parsing [sent. 2573 len. 23]: And I thought -- Surely even the contact with such a man will do something to refine the taste of my people .
Parsing [sent. 2574 len. 94]: I felt more certain than ever that a free mingling of all classes would do more than anything else towards binding us all into a wise patriotic nation ; would tend to keep down that foolish emulation which makes one class ape another from afar , like Ben Jonson 's Fungoso , `` still lighting short a suit ; '' would refine the roughness of the rude , and enable the polished to see with what safety his just share in public matters might be committed into the hands of the honest workman .
Parsing [sent. 2575 len. 29]: If we could once leave it to each other to give what honour is due ; knowing that honour demanded is as worthless as insult undeserved is hurtless !
Parsing [sent. 2576 len. 9]: What has one to do to honour himself ?
Parsing [sent. 2577 len. 8]: That is and can be no honour .
Parsing [sent. 2578 len. 30]: When one has learned to seek the honour that cometh from God only , he will take the withholding of the honour that comes from men very quietly indeed .
Parsing [sent. 2579 len. 19]: The only thing that disappointed me was , that there was no one there to represent Oldcastle Hall .
Parsing [sent. 2580 len. 11]: But how could I have everything a success at once !
Parsing [sent. 2581 len. 8]: -- And Catherine Weir was likewise absent .
Parsing [sent. 2582 len. 57]: After we had spent a while in pleasant talk , and when I thought nearly all were with us , I got up on a chair at the end of the barn , and said : -- `` Kind friends , -- I am very grateful to you for honouring my invitation as you have done .
Parsing [sent. 2583 len. 36]: Permit me to hope that this meeting will be the first of many , and that from it may grow the yearly custom in this parish of gathering in love and friendship upon Christmas Eve .
Parsing [sent. 2584 len. 13]: When God comes to man , man looks round for his neighbour .
Parsing [sent. 2585 len. 74]: When man departed from God in the Garden of Eden , the only man in the world ceased to be the friend of the only woman in the world ; and , instead of seeking to bear her burden , became her accuser to God , in whom he saw only the Judge , unable to perceive that the Infinite love of the Father had come to punish him in tenderness and grace .
Parsing [sent. 2586 len. 28]: But when God in Jesus comes back to men , brothers and sisters spread forth their arms to embrace each other , and so to embrace Him .
Parsing [sent. 2587 len. 12]: This is , when He is born again in our souls .
Parsing [sent. 2588 len. 49]: For , dear friends , what we all need is just to become little children like Him ; to cease to be careful about many things , and trust in Him , seeking only that He should rule , and that we should be made good like Him .
Parsing [sent. 2589 len. 28]: What else is meant by ` Seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness , and all these things shall be added unto you ? '
Parsing [sent. 2590 len. 44]: Instead of doing so , we seek the things God has promised to look after for us , and refuse to seek the thing He wants us to seek -- a thing that can not be given us , except we seek it .
Parsing [sent. 2591 len. 55]: We profess to think Jesus the grandest and most glorious of men , and yet hardly care to be like Him ; and so when we are offered His Spirit , that is , His very nature within us , for the asking , we will hardly take the trouble to ask for it .
Parsing [sent. 2592 len. 64]: But to-night , at least , let all unkind thoughts , all hard judgments of one another , all selfish desires after our own way , be put from us , that we may welcome the Babe into our very bosoms ; that when He comes amongst us -- for is He not like a child still , meek and lowly of heart ?
Parsing [sent. 2593 len. 20]: -- He may not be troubled to find that we are quarrelsome , and selfish , and unjust . ''
Parsing [sent. 2594 len. 46]: I came down from the chair , and Mr Brownrigg being the nearest of my guests , and wide awake , for he had been standing , and had indeed been listening to every word according to his ability , I shook hands with him .
Parsing [sent. 2595 len. 15]: And positively there was some meaning in the grasp with which he returned mine .
Parsing [sent. 2596 len. 32]: I am not going to record all the proceedings of the evening ; but I think it may be interesting to my readers to know something of how we spent it .
Parsing [sent. 2597 len. 12]: First of all , we sang a hymn about the Nativity .
Parsing [sent. 2598 len. 44]: And then I read an extract from a book of travels , describing the interior of an Eastern cottage , probably much resembling the inn in which our Lord was born , the stable being scarcely divided fron the rest of the house .
Parsing [sent. 2599 len. 79]: For I felt that to open the inner eyes even of the brain , enabling people to SEE in some measure the reality of the old lovely story , to help them to have what the Scotch philosophers call a true CONCEPTION of the external conditions and circumstances of the events , might help to open the yet deeper spiritual eyes which alone can see the meaning and truth dwelling in and giving shape to the outward facts .
Parsing [sent. 2600 len. 41]: And the extract was listened to with all the attention I could wish , except , at first , from some youngsters at the further end of the barn , who became , however , perfectly still as I proceeded .
Parsing [sent. 2601 len. 40]: After this followed conversation , during which I talked a good deal to Jane Rogers , paying her particular attention indeed , with the hope of a chance of bringing old Mr Brownrigg and her together in some way .
Parsing [sent. 2602 len. 9]: `` How is your mistress , Jane ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2603 len. 3]: I said .
Parsing [sent. 2604 len. 9]: `` Quite well , sir , thank you .
Parsing [sent. 2605 len. 8]: I only wish she was here . ''
Parsing [sent. 2606 len. 6]: `` I wish she were .
Parsing [sent. 2607 len. 9]: But perhaps she will come next year . ''
Parsing [sent. 2608 len. 6]: `` I think she will .
Parsing [sent. 2609 len. 55]: I am almost sure she would have liked to come to-night ; for I heard her say '' -- `` I beg your pardon , Jane , for interrupting you ; but I would rather not be told anything you may have happened to overhear , '' I said , in a low voice .
Parsing [sent. 2610 len. 6]: `` Oh , sir ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2611 len. 16]: returned Jane , blushing a dark crimson ; `` it was n't anything particular . ''
Parsing [sent. 2612 len. 37]: `` Still , if it was anything on which a wrong conjecture might be built '' -- I wanted to soften it to her -- `` it is better that one should not be told it .
Parsing [sent. 2613 len. 9]: Thank you for your kind intention , though .
Parsing [sent. 2614 len. 18]: And now , Jane , '' I said , `` will you do me a favour ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2615 len. 12]: `` That I will , sir , if I can . ''
Parsing [sent. 2616 len. 16]: `` Sing that Christmas carol I heard you sing last night to your mother . ''
Parsing [sent. 2617 len. 13]: `` I did n't know any one was listening , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 2618 len. 7]: `` I know you did not .
Parsing [sent. 2619 len. 16]: I came to the door with your father , and we stood and listened . ''
Parsing [sent. 2620 len. 5]: She looked very frightened .
Parsing [sent. 2621 len. 19]: But I would not have asked her had I not known that she could sing like a bird .
Parsing [sent. 2622 len. 16]: `` I am afraid I shall make a fool of myself , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 2623 len. 20]: `` We should all be willing to run that risk for the sake of others , '' I answered .
Parsing [sent. 2624 len. 9]: `` I will try then , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 2625 len. 15]: So she sang , and her clear voice soon silenced the speech all round .
Parsing [sent. 2626 len. 30]: `` Babe Jesus lay on Mary 's lap ; The sun shone in His hair : And so it was she saw , mayhap , The crown already there .
Parsing [sent. 2627 len. 13]: `` For she sang : ` Sleep on , my little King !
Parsing [sent. 2628 len. 23]: Bad Herod dares not come ; Before Thee , sleeping , holy thing , Wild winds would soon be dumb . '' '
Parsing [sent. 2629 len. 36]: I kiss Thy hands , I kiss Thy feet , My King , so long desired ; Thy hands shall never be soil 'd , my sweet , Thy feet shall never be tired . ''
Parsing [sent. 2630 len. 33]: ` For Thou art the King of men , my son ; Thy crown I see it plain ; And men shall worship Thee , every one , And cry , Glory !
Parsing [sent. 2631 len. 3]: Amen . ''
Parsing [sent. 2632 len. 10]: `` Babe Jesus open 'd His eyes so wide !
Parsing [sent. 2633 len. 7]: At Mary look 'd her Lord .
Parsing [sent. 2634 len. 9]: And Mary stinted her song and sigh 'd .
Parsing [sent. 2635 len. 8]: Babe Jesus said never a word . ''
Parsing [sent. 2636 len. 28]: When Jane had done singing , I asked her where she had learned the carol ; and she answered , -- `` My mistress gave it me .
Parsing [sent. 2637 len. 16]: There was a picture to it of the Baby on his mother 's knee . ''
Parsing [sent. 2638 len. 10]: `` I never saw it , '' I said .
Parsing [sent. 2639 len. 9]: `` Where did you get the tune ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2640 len. 21]: `` I thought it would go with a tune I knew ; and I tried it , and it did .
Parsing [sent. 2641 len. 13]: But I was not fit to sing to you , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 2642 len. 13]: `` You must have quite a gift of song , Jane ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2643 len. 3]: I said .
Parsing [sent. 2644 len. 10]: `` My father and mother can both sing . ''
Parsing [sent. 2645 len. 19]: Mr Brownrigg was seated on the other side of me , and had apparently listened with some interest .
Parsing [sent. 2646 len. 12]: His face was ten degrees less stupid than it usually was .
Parsing [sent. 2647 len. 13]: I fancied I saw even a glimmer of some satisfaction in it .
Parsing [sent. 2648 len. 6]: I turned to Old Rogers .
Parsing [sent. 2649 len. 13]: `` Sing us a song , Old Rogers , '' I said .
Parsing [sent. 2650 len. 19]: `` I 'm no canary at that , sir ; and besides , my singing days be over .
Parsing [sent. 2651 len. 9]: I advise you to ask Dr. Duncan there .
Parsing [sent. 2652 len. 5]: He CAN sing . ''
Parsing [sent. 2653 len. 35]: I rose and said to the assembly : `` My friends , if I did not think God was pleased to see us enjoying ourselves , I should have no heart for it myself .
Parsing [sent. 2654 len. 16]: I am going to ask our dear friend Dr. Duncan to give us a song .
Parsing [sent. 2655 len. 9]: -- If you please , Dr. Duncan . ''
Parsing [sent. 2656 len. 20]: `` I am very nearly too old , '' said the doctor ; `` but I will try . ''
Parsing [sent. 2657 len. 19]: His voice was certainly a little feeble ; but the song was not much the worse for it .
Parsing [sent. 2658 len. 16]: And a more suitable one for all the company he could hardly have pitched upon .
Parsing [sent. 2659 len. 19]: `` There is a plough that has no share , But a coulter that parteth keen and fair .
Parsing [sent. 2660 len. 20]: But the furrows they rise To a terrible size , Or ever the plough hath touch 'd them there .
Parsing [sent. 2661 len. 21]: ` Gainst horses and plough in wrath they shake : The horses are fierce ; but the plough will break .
Parsing [sent. 2662 len. 23]: `` And the seed that is dropt in those furrows of fear , Will lift to the sun neither blade nor ear .
Parsing [sent. 2663 len. 33]: Down it drops plumb , Where no spring times come ; And here there needeth no harrowing gear : Wheat nor poppy nor any leaf Will cover this naked ground of grief .
Parsing [sent. 2664 len. 48]: `` But a harvest-day will come at last When the watery winter all is past ; The waves so gray Will be shorn away By the angels ' sickles keen and fast ; And the buried harvest of the sea Stored in the barns of eternity . ''
Parsing [sent. 2665 len. 9]: Genuine applause followed the good doctor 's song .
Parsing [sent. 2666 len. 25]: I turned to Miss Boulderstone , from whom I had borrowed a piano , and asked her to play a country dance for us .
Parsing [sent. 2667 len. 29]: But first I said -- not getting up on a chair this time : -- `` Some people think it is not proper for a clergyman to dance .
Parsing [sent. 2668 len. 11]: I mean to assert my freedom from any such law .
Parsing [sent. 2669 len. 52]: If our Lord chose to represent , in His parable of the Prodigal Son , the joy in Heaven over a repentant sinner by the figure of ` music and dancing , ' I will hearken to Him rather than to men , be they as good as they may . ''
Parsing [sent. 2670 len. 23]: For I had long thought that the way to make indifferent things bad , was for good people not to do them .
Parsing [sent. 2671 len. 19]: And so saying , I stepped up to Jane Rogers , and asked her to dance with me .
Parsing [sent. 2672 len. 19]: She blushed so dreadfully that , for a moment , I was almost sorry I had asked her .
Parsing [sent. 2673 len. 51]: But she put her hand in mine at once ; and if she was a little clumsy , she yet danced very naturally , and I had the satisfaction of feeling that I had an honest girl near me , who I knew was friendly to me in her heart .
Parsing [sent. 2674 len. 9]: But to see the faces of the people !
Parsing [sent. 2675 len. 15]: While I had been talking , Old Rogers had been drinking in every word .
Parsing [sent. 2676 len. 11]: To him it was milk and strong meat in one .
Parsing [sent. 2677 len. 12]: But now his face shone with a father 's gratification besides .
Parsing [sent. 2678 len. 8]: And Richard 's face was glowing too .
Parsing [sent. 2679 len. 14]: Even old Brownrigg looked with a curious interest upon us , I thought .
Parsing [sent. 2680 len. 30]: Meantime Dr Duncan was dancing with one of his own patients , old Mrs Trotter , to whose wants he ministered far more from his table than his surgery .
Parsing [sent. 2681 len. 37]: I have known that man , hearing of a case of want from his servant , send the fowl he was about to dine upon , untouched , to those whose necessity was greater than his .
Parsing [sent. 2682 len. 18]: And Mr Boulderstone had taken out old Mrs Rogers ; and young Brownrigg had taken Mary Weir .
Parsing [sent. 2683 len. 13]: Thomas Weir did not dance at all , but looked on kindly .
Parsing [sent. 2684 len. 11]: `` Why do n't you dance , Old Rogers ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2685 len. 14]: I said , as I placed his daughter in a seat beside him .
Parsing [sent. 2686 len. 14]: `` Did your honour ever see an elephant go up the futtock-shrouds ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2687 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 2688 len. 5]: I never did . ''
Parsing [sent. 2689 len. 17]: `` I thought you must , sir , to ask me why I do n't dance .
Parsing [sent. 2690 len. 10]: You wo n't take my fun ill , sir ?
Parsing [sent. 2691 len. 17]: I 'm an old man-o ' - war 's man , you know , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 2692 len. 27]: `` I should have thought , Rogers , that you would have known better by this time , than make such an apology to ME . ''
Parsing [sent. 2693 len. 7]: `` God bless you , sir .
Parsing [sent. 2694 len. 29]: An old man 's safe with you -- or a young lass , either , sir , '' he added , turning with a smile to his daughter .
Parsing [sent. 2695 len. 8]: I turned , and addressed Mr Boulderstone .
Parsing [sent. 2696 len. 21]: `` I am greatly obliged to you , Mr Boulderstone , for the help you have given me this evening .
Parsing [sent. 2697 len. 19]: I 've seen you talking to everybody , just as if you had to entertain them all . ''
Parsing [sent. 2698 len. 12]: `` I hope I have n't taken too much upon me .
Parsing [sent. 2699 len. 24]: But the fact is , somehow or other , I do n't know how , I got into the spirit of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2700 len. 22]: `` You got into the spirit of it because you wanted to help me , and I thank you heartily . ''
Parsing [sent. 2701 len. 19]: `` Well , I thought it was n't a time to mind one 's peas and cues exactly .
Parsing [sent. 2702 len. 12]: And really it 's wonderful how one gets on without them .
Parsing [sent. 2703 len. 6]: I hate formality myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 2704 len. 13]: The dear fellow was the most formal man I had ever met .
Parsing [sent. 2705 len. 11]: `` Why do n't you dance , Mr Brownrigg ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2706 len. 11]: `` Who 'd care to dance with me , sir ?
Parsing [sent. 2707 len. 24]: I do n't care to dance with an old woman ; and a young woman wo n't care to dance with me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2708 len. 18]: `` I 'll find you a partner , if you will put yourself in my hands . ''
Parsing [sent. 2709 len. 13]: `` I do n't mind trusting myself to you , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 2710 len. 8]: So I led him to Jane Rogers .
Parsing [sent. 2711 len. 13]: She stood up in respectful awe before the master of her destiny .
Parsing [sent. 2712 len. 18]: There were signs of calcitration in the churchwarden , when he perceived whither I was leading him .
Parsing [sent. 2713 len. 73]: But when he saw the girl stand trembling before him , whether it was that he was flattered by the signs of his own power , accepting them as homage , or that his hard heart actually softened a little , I can not tell , but , after just a perceptible hesitation , he said : `` Come along , my lass , and let 's have a hop together . ''
Parsing [sent. 2714 len. 5]: She obeyed very sweetly .
Parsing [sent. 2715 len. 17]: `` Do n't be too shy , '' I whispered to her as she passed me .
Parsing [sent. 2716 len. 13]: And the churchwarden danced very heartily with the lady 's - maid .
Parsing [sent. 2717 len. 23]: I then asked him to take her into the house , and give her something to eat in return for her song .
Parsing [sent. 2718 len. 15]: He yielded somewhat awkwardly , and what passed between them I do not know .
Parsing [sent. 2719 len. 20]: But when they returned , she seemed less frightened at him than when she heard me make the proposal .
Parsing [sent. 2720 len. 34]: And when the company was parting , I heard him take leave of her with the words -- `` Give us a kiss , my girl , and let bygones be bygones . ''
Parsing [sent. 2721 len. 7]: Which kiss I heard with delight .
Parsing [sent. 2722 len. 11]: For had I not been a peacemaker in this matter ?
Parsing [sent. 2723 len. 11]: And had I not then a right to feel blessed ?
Parsing [sent. 2724 len. 29]: -- But the understanding was brought about simply by making the people meet -- compelling them , as it were , to know something of each other really .
Parsing [sent. 2725 len. 44]: Hitherto this girl had been a mere name , or phantom at best , to her lover 's father ; and it was easy for him to treat her as such , that is , as a mere fancy of his son 's .
Parsing [sent. 2726 len. 37]: The idea of her had passed through his mind ; but with what vividness any idea , notion , or conception could be present to him , my readers must judge from my description of him .
Parsing [sent. 2727 len. 11]: So that obstinacy was a ridiculously easy accomplishment to him .
Parsing [sent. 2728 len. 22]: For he never had any notion of the matter to which he was opposed -- only of that which he favoured .
Parsing [sent. 2729 len. 14]: It is very easy indeed for such people to stick to their point .
Parsing [sent. 2730 len. 12]: But I took care that we should have dancing in moderation .
Parsing [sent. 2731 len. 26]: It would not do for people either to get weary with recreation , or excited with what was not worthy of producing such an effect .
Parsing [sent. 2732 len. 11]: Indeed we had only six country dances during the evening .
Parsing [sent. 2733 len. 4]: That was all .
Parsing [sent. 2734 len. 32]: And between the dances I read two or three of Wordsworth 's ballads to them , and they listened even with more interest than I had been able to hope for .
Parsing [sent. 2735 len. 20]: The fact was , that the happy and free hearted mood they were in `` enabled the judgment . ''
Parsing [sent. 2736 len. 25]: I wish one knew always by what musical spell to produce the right mood for receiving and reflecting a matter as it really is .
Parsing [sent. 2737 len. 37]: Every true poem carries this spell with it in its own music , which it sends out before it as a harbinger , or properly a HERBERGER , to prepare a harbour or lodging for it .
Parsing [sent. 2738 len. 19]: But then it needs a quiet mood first of all , to let this music be listened to .
Parsing [sent. 2739 len. 46]: For I thought with myself , if I could get them to like poetry and beautiful things in words , it would not only do them good , but help them to see what is in the Bible , and therefore to love it more .
Parsing [sent. 2740 len. 29]: For I never could believe that a man who did not find God in other places as well as in the Bible ever found Him there at all .
Parsing [sent. 2741 len. 37]: And I always thought , that to find God in other books enabled us to see clearly that he was MORE in the Bible than in any other book , or all other books put together .
Parsing [sent. 2742 len. 9]: After supper we had a little more singing .
Parsing [sent. 2743 len. 23]: And to my satisfaction nothing came to my eyes or ears , during the whole evening , that was undignified or ill-bred .
Parsing [sent. 2744 len. 24]: Of course , I knew that many of them must have two behaviours , and that now they were on their good behaviour .
Parsing [sent. 2745 len. 28]: But I thought the oftener such were put on their good behaviour , giving them the opportunity of finding out how nice it was , the better .
Parsing [sent. 2746 len. 11]: It might make them ashamed of the other at last .
Parsing [sent. 2747 len. 32]: There were many little bits of conversation I overheard , which I should like to give my readers ; but I can not dwell longer upon this part of my Annals .
Parsing [sent. 2748 len. 32]: Especially I should have enjoyed recording one piece of talk , in which Old Rogers was evidently trying to move a more directly religious feeling in the mind of Dr Duncan .
Parsing [sent. 2749 len. 18]: I thought I could see that THE difficulty with the noble old gentleman was one of expression .
Parsing [sent. 2750 len. 36]: But after all the old foremast-man was a seer of the Kingdom ; and the other , with all his refinement , and education , and goodness too , was but a child in it .
Parsing [sent. 2751 len. 26]: Before we parted , I gave to each of my guests a sheet of Christmas Carols , gathered from the older portions of our literature .
Parsing [sent. 2752 len. 19]: For most of the modern hymns are to my mind neither milk nor meat -- mere wretched imitations .
Parsing [sent. 2753 len. 70]: There were a few curious words and idioms in these , but I thought it better to leave them as they were ; for they might set them inquiring , and give me an opportunity of interesting them further , some time or other , in the history of a word ; for , in their ups and downs of fortune , words fare very much like human beings .
Parsing [sent. 2754 len. 15]: And here is my sheet of Carols : -- AN HYMNE OF HEAVENLY LOVE .
Parsing [sent. 2755 len. 6]: O blessed Well of Love !
Parsing [sent. 2756 len. 5]: O Floure of Grace !
Parsing [sent. 2757 len. 4]: O glorious Morning-Starre !
Parsing [sent. 2758 len. 5]: O Lampe of Light !
Parsing [sent. 2759 len. 38]: Most lively image of thy Father 's face , Eternal King of Glorie , Lord of Might , Meeke Lambe of God , before all worlds behight , How can we Thee requite for all this good ?
Parsing [sent. 2760 len. 10]: Or what can prize that Thy most precious blood ?
Parsing [sent. 2761 len. 27]: Yet nought Thou ask ` st in lieu of all this love , But love of us , for guerdon of Thy paine : Ay me !
Parsing [sent. 2762 len. 8]: what can us lesse than that behove ?
Parsing [sent. 2763 len. 19]: Had He required life of us againe , Had it beene wrong to ask His owne with gaine ?
Parsing [sent. 2764 len. 21]: He gave us life , He it restored lost ; Then life were least , that us so little cost .
Parsing [sent. 2765 len. 68]: But He our life hath left unto us free , Free that was thrall , and blessed that was bann 'd ; Ne ought demaunds but that we loving bee , As He himselfe hath lov 'd us afore-hand , And bound therto with an eternall band , Him first to love that us so dearely bought , And next our brethren , to His image wrought .
Parsing [sent. 2766 len. 70]: Him first to love great right and reason is , Who first to us our life and being gave , And after , when we fared had amisse , Us wretches from the second death did save ; And last , the food of life , which now we have , Even He Himselfe , in His dear sacrament , To feede our hungry soules , unto us lent .
Parsing [sent. 2767 len. 67]: Then next , to love our brethren , that were made Of that selfe mould , and that self Maker 's hand , That we , and to the same againe shall fade , Where they shall have like heritage of land , However here on higher steps we stand , Which also were with self-same price redeemed That we , however of us light esteemed .
Parsing [sent. 2768 len. 8]: Then rouze thy selfe , O Earth !
Parsing [sent. 2769 len. 58]: out of thy soyle , In which thou wallowest like to filthy swyne , And doest thy mynd in durty pleasures moyle , Unmindfull of that dearest Lord of thyne ; Lift up to Him thy heavie clouded eyne , That thou this soveraine bountie mayst behold , And read , through love , His mercies manifold .
Parsing [sent. 2770 len. 63]: Beginne from first , where He encradled was In simple cratch , wrapt in a wad of hay , Betweene the toylfull oxe and humble asse , And in what rags , and in how base array , The glory of our heavenly riches lay , When Him the silly shepheards came to see , Whom greatest princes sought on lowest knee .
Parsing [sent. 2771 len. 67]: From thence reade on the storie of His life , His humble carriage , His unfaulty wayes , His cancred foes , His fights , His toyle , His strife , His paines , His povertie , His sharpe assayes , Through which He past His miserable dayes , Offending none , and doing good to all , Yet being malist both by great and small .
Parsing [sent. 2772 len. 67]: With all thy hart , with all thy soule and mind , Thou must Him love , and His beheasts embrace ; All other loves , with which the world doth blind Weake fancies , and stirre up affections base , Thou must renounce and utterly displace , And give thy selfe unto Him full and free , That full and freely gave Himselfe to thee .
Parsing [sent. 2773 len. 58]: Then shall thy ravisht soul inspired bee With heavenly thoughts farre above humane skil , And thy bright radiant eyes shall plainly see Th ' idee of His pure glorie present still Before thy face , that all thy spirits shall fill With sweet enragement of celestial love , Kindled through sight of those faire things above .
Parsing [sent. 2774 len. 7]: Spencer NEW PRINCE , NEW POMP .
Parsing [sent. 2775 len. 19]: Behold a silly tender Babe , In freezing winter night , In homely manger trembling lies ; Alas !
Parsing [sent. 2776 len. 4]: a piteous sight .
Parsing [sent. 2777 len. 28]: The inns are full , no man will yield This little Pilgrim bed ; But forced He is with silly beasts In crib to shroud His head .
Parsing [sent. 2778 len. 25]: Despise Him not for lying there , First what He is inquire ; An orient pearl is often found In depth of dirty mire .
Parsing [sent. 2779 len. 30]: Weigh not His crib , His wooden dish , Nor beast that by Him feed ; Weigh not his mother 's poor attire , Nor Joseph 's simple weed .
Parsing [sent. 2780 len. 29]: This stable is a Prince 's court , The crib His chair of state ; The beasts are parcel of His pomp , The wooden dish His plate .
Parsing [sent. 2781 len. 25]: The persons in that poor attire His royal liveries wear ; The Prince himself is come from heaven -- This pomp is praised there .
Parsing [sent. 2782 len. 8]: With joy approach , O Christian wight !
Parsing [sent. 2783 len. 19]: Do homage to thy King ; And highly praise this humble pomp Which He from heaven doth bring .
Parsing [sent. 2784 len. 2]: SOUTHWELL .
Parsing [sent. 2785 len. 6]: A DIALOGUE BETWEEN THREE SHEPHERDS .
Parsing [sent. 2786 len. 2]: 1 .
Parsing [sent. 2787 len. 32]: Where is this blessed Babe That hath made All the world so full of joy And expectation ; That glorious Boy That crowns each nation With a triumphant wreath of blessedness ?
Parsing [sent. 2788 len. 2]: 2 .
Parsing [sent. 2789 len. 42]: Where should He be but in the throng , And among His angel-ministers , that sing And take wing Just as may echo to His voice , And rejoice , When wing and tongue and all May so procure their happiness ?
Parsing [sent. 2790 len. 2]: 3 .
Parsing [sent. 2791 len. 7]: But He hath other waiters now .
Parsing [sent. 2792 len. 24]: A poor cow , An ox and mule stand and behold , And wonder That a stable should enfold Him that can thunder .
Parsing [sent. 2793 len. 2]: Chorus .
Parsing [sent. 2794 len. 8]: O what a gracious God have we !
Parsing [sent. 2795 len. 3]: How good !
Parsing [sent. 2796 len. 3]: How great !
Parsing [sent. 2797 len. 5]: Even as our misery .
Parsing [sent. 2798 len. 3]: Jeremy Taylor .
Parsing [sent. 2799 len. 10]: A SONG OF PRAISE FOR THE BIRTH OF CHRIST .
Parsing [sent. 2800 len. 30]: Away , dark thoughts ; awake , my joy ; Awake , my glory ; sing ; Sing songs to celebrate the birth Of Jacob 's God and King .
Parsing [sent. 2801 len. 16]: O happy night , that brought forth light , Which makes the blind to see !
Parsing [sent. 2802 len. 14]: The day spring from on high came down To cheer and visit thee .
Parsing [sent. 2803 len. 28]: The wakeful shepherds , near their flocks , Were watchful for the morn ; But better news from heaven was brought , Your Saviour Christ is born .
Parsing [sent. 2804 len. 24]: In Bethlem-town the infant lies , Within a place obscure , O little Bethlem , poor in walls , But rich in furniture !
Parsing [sent. 2805 len. 14]: Since heaven is now come down to earth , Hither the angels fly !
Parsing [sent. 2806 len. 14]: Hark , how the heavenly choir doth sing Glory to God on High !
Parsing [sent. 2807 len. 30]: The news is spread , the church is glad , SIMEON , o'ercome with joy , Sings with the infant in his arms , NOW LET THY SERVANT DIE .
Parsing [sent. 2808 len. 26]: Wise men from far beheld the star , Which was their faithful guide , Until it pointed forth the Babe , And Him they glorified .
Parsing [sent. 2809 len. 14]: Do heaven and earth rejoice and sing -- Shall we our Christ deny ?
Parsing [sent. 2810 len. 17]: He 's born for us , and we for Him : GLORY TO GOD ON HIGH .
Parsing [sent. 2811 len. 3]: JOHN MASON .
Parsing [sent. 2812 len. 3]: CHAPTER XI .
Parsing [sent. 2813 len. 6]: SERMON ON GOD AND MAMMON .
Parsing [sent. 2814 len. 39]: I never asked questions about the private affairs of any of my parishioners , except of themselves individually upon occasion of their asking me for advice , and some consequent necessity for knowing more than they told me .
Parsing [sent. 2815 len. 15]: Hence , I believe , they became the more willing that I should know .
Parsing [sent. 2816 len. 33]: But I heard a good many things from others , notwithstanding , for I could not be constantly closing the lips of the communicative as I had done those of Jane Rogers .
Parsing [sent. 2817 len. 22]: And amongst other things , I learned that Miss Oldcastle went most Sundays to the neighbouring town of Addicehead to church .
Parsing [sent. 2818 len. 34]: Now I had often heard of the ability of the rector , and although I had never met him , was prepared to find him a cultivated , if not an original man .
Parsing [sent. 2819 len. 37]: Still , if I must be honest , which I hope I must , I confess that I heard the news with a pang , in analysing which I discovered the chief component to be jealousy .
Parsing [sent. 2820 len. 18]: It was no use asking myself why I should be jealous : there the ugly thing was .
Parsing [sent. 2821 len. 32]: So I went and told God I was ashamed , and begged Him to deliver me from the evil , because His was the kingdom and the power and the glory .
Parsing [sent. 2822 len. 15]: And He took my part against myself , for He waits to be gracious .
Parsing [sent. 2823 len. 33]: Perhaps the reader may , however , suspect a deeper cause for this feeling -LRB- to which I would rather not give the true name again -RRB- than a merely professional one .
Parsing [sent. 2824 len. 27]: But there was one stray sheep of my flock that appeared in church for the first time on the morning of Christmas Day -- Catherine Weir .
Parsing [sent. 2825 len. 25]: She did not sit beside her father , but in the most shadowy corner of the church -- near the organ loft , however .
Parsing [sent. 2826 len. 30]: She could have seen her father if she had looked up , but she kept her eyes down the whole time , and never even lifted them to me .
Parsing [sent. 2827 len. 21]: The spot on one cheek was much brighter than that on the other , and made her look very ill .
Parsing [sent. 2828 len. 45]: I prayed to our God to grant me the honour of speaking a true word to them all ; which honour I thought I was right in asking , because the Lord reproached the Pharisees for not seeking the honour that cometh from God .
Parsing [sent. 2829 len. 12]: Perhaps I may have put a wrong interpretation on the passage .
Parsing [sent. 2830 len. 35]: It is , however , a joy to think that He will not give you a stone , even if you should take it for a loaf , and ask for it as such .
Parsing [sent. 2831 len. 29]: Nor is He , like the scribes , lying in wait to catch poor erring men in their words or their prayers , however mistaken they may be .
Parsing [sent. 2832 len. 11]: I took my text from the Sermon on the Mount .
Parsing [sent. 2833 len. 42]: And as the magazine for which these Annals were first written was intended chiefly for Sunday reading , I wrote my sermon just as if I were preaching it to my unseen readers as I spoke it to my present parishioners .
Parsing [sent. 2834 len. 37]: And here it is now : The Gospel according to St Matthew , the sixth chapter , and part of the twenty-fourth and twenty-fifth verses : -- '' ` YE CAN NOT SERVE GOD AND MAMMON .
Parsing [sent. 2835 len. 14]: THEREFORE I SAY TO YOU , TAKE NO THOUGHT FOR YOUR LIFE . '
Parsing [sent. 2836 len. 25]: `` When the Child whose birth we celebrate with glad hearts this day , grew up to be a man , He said this .
Parsing [sent. 2837 len. 5]: Did He mean it ?
Parsing [sent. 2838 len. 10]: -- He never said what He did not mean .
Parsing [sent. 2839 len. 6]: Did He mean it wholly ?
Parsing [sent. 2840 len. 12]: -- He meant it far beyond what the words could convey .
Parsing [sent. 2841 len. 7]: He meant it altogether and entirely .
Parsing [sent. 2842 len. 54]: When people do not understand what the Lord says , when it seems to them that His advice is impracticable , instead of searching deeper for a meaning which will be evidently true and wise , they comfort themselves by thinking He could not have meant it altogether , and so leave it .
Parsing [sent. 2843 len. 20]: Or they think that if He did mean it , He could not expect them to carry it out .
Parsing [sent. 2844 len. 52]: And in the fact that they could not do it perfectly if they were to try , they take refuge from the duty of trying to do it at all ; or , oftener , they do not think about it at all as anything that in the least concerns them .
Parsing [sent. 2845 len. 79]: The Son of our Father in heaven may have become a child , may have led the one life which belongs to every man to lead , may have suffered because we are sinners , may have died for our sakes , doing the will of His Father in heaven , and yet we have nothing to do with the words He spoke out of the midst of His true , perfect knowledge , feeling , and action !
Parsing [sent. 2846 len. 10]: Is it not strange that it should be so ?
Parsing [sent. 2847 len. 10]: Let it not be so with us this day .
Parsing [sent. 2848 len. 50]: Let us seek to find out what our Lord means , that we may do it ; trying and failing and trying again -- verily to be victorious at last -- what matter WHEN , so long as we are trying , and so coming nearer to our end !
Parsing [sent. 2849 len. 9]: `` MAMMON , you know , means RICHES .
Parsing [sent. 2850 len. 24]: Now , riches are meant to be the slave -- not even the servant of man , and not to be the master .
Parsing [sent. 2851 len. 31]: If a man serve his own servant , or , in a word , any one who has no just claim to be his master , he is a slave .
Parsing [sent. 2852 len. 8]: But here he serves his own slave .
Parsing [sent. 2853 len. 37]: On the other hand , to serve God , the source of our being , our own glorious Father , is freedom ; in fact , is the only way to get rid of all bondage .
Parsing [sent. 2854 len. 15]: So you see plainly enough that a man can not serve God and Mammon .
Parsing [sent. 2855 len. 33]: For how can a slave of his own slave be the servant of the God of freedom , of Him who can have no one to serve Him but a free man ?
Parsing [sent. 2856 len. 5]: His service is freedom .
Parsing [sent. 2857 len. 15]: Do not , I pray you , make any confusion between service and slavery .
Parsing [sent. 2858 len. 11]: To serve is the highest , noblest calling in creation .
Parsing [sent. 2859 len. 22]: For even the Son of man came not to be ministered unto , but to minister , yea , with Himself .
Parsing [sent. 2860 len. 9]: `` But how can a man SERVE riches ?
Parsing [sent. 2861 len. 15]: Why , when he says to riches , ` Ye are my good . '
Parsing [sent. 2862 len. 11]: When he feels he can not be happy without them .
Parsing [sent. 2863 len. 13]: When he puts forth the energies of his nature to get them .
Parsing [sent. 2864 len. 11]: When he schemes and dreams and lies awake about them .
Parsing [sent. 2865 len. 15]: When he will not give to his neighbour for fear of becoming poor himself .
Parsing [sent. 2866 len. 19]: When he wants to have more , and to know he has more , than he can need .
Parsing [sent. 2867 len. 27]: When he wants to leave money behind him , not for the sake of his children or relatives , but for the name of the wealth .
Parsing [sent. 2868 len. 43]: When he leaves his money , not to those who NEED it , even of his relations , but to those who are rich like himself , making them yet more of slaves to the overgrown monster they worship for his size .
Parsing [sent. 2869 len. 35]: When he honours those who have money because they have money , irrespective of their character ; or when he honours in a rich man what he would not honour in a poor man .
Parsing [sent. 2870 len. 8]: Then is he the slave of Mammon .
Parsing [sent. 2871 len. 39]: Still more is he Mammon 's slave when his devotion to his god makes him oppressive to those over whom his wealth gives him power ; or when he becomes unjust in order to add to his stores .
Parsing [sent. 2872 len. 28]: -- How will it be with such a man when on a sudden he finds that the world has vanished , and he is alone with God ?
Parsing [sent. 2873 len. 35]: There lies the body in which he used to live , whose poor necessities first made money of value to him , but with which itself and its fictitious value are both left behind .
Parsing [sent. 2874 len. 13]: He can not now even try to bribe God with a cheque .
Parsing [sent. 2875 len. 48]: The angels will not bow down to him because his property , as set forth in his will , takes five or six figures to express its amount It makes no difference to them that he has lost it , though ; for they never respected him .
Parsing [sent. 2876 len. 62]: And the poor souls of Hades , who envied him the wealth they had lost before , rise up as one man to welcome him , not for love of him -- no worshipper of Mammon loves another -- but rejoicing in the mischief that has befallen him , and saying , ` Art thou also become one of us ? '
Parsing [sent. 2877 len. 47]: And Lazarus in Abraham 's bosom , however sorry he may be for him , however grateful he may feel to him for the broken victuals and the penny , can not with one drop of the water of Paradise cool that man 's parched tongue .
Parsing [sent. 2878 len. 6]: `` Alas , poor Dives !
Parsing [sent. 2879 len. 16]: poor server of Mammon , whose vile god can pretend to deliver him no longer !
Parsing [sent. 2880 len. 24]: Or rather , for the blockish god never pretended anything -- it was the man 's own doing -- Alas for the Mammon-worshipper !
Parsing [sent. 2881 len. 10]: he can no longer deceive himself in his riches .
Parsing [sent. 2882 len. 23]: And so even in hell he is something nobler than he was on earth ; for he worships his riches no longer .
Parsing [sent. 2883 len. 4]: He can not .
Parsing [sent. 2884 len. 4]: He curses them .
Parsing [sent. 2885 len. 9]: `` Terrible things to say on Christmas Day !
Parsing [sent. 2886 len. 32]: But if Christmas Day teaches us anything , it teaches us to worship God and not Mammon ; to worship spirit and not matter ; to worship love and not power .
Parsing [sent. 2887 len. 20]: `` Do I now hear any of my friends saying in their hearts : Let the rich take that !
Parsing [sent. 2888 len. 7]: It does not apply to us .
Parsing [sent. 2889 len. 5]: We are poor enough ?
Parsing [sent. 2890 len. 25]: Ah , my friends , I have known a light-hearted , liberal rich man lose his riches , and be liberal and light-hearted still .
Parsing [sent. 2891 len. 46]: I knew a rich lady once , in giving a large gift of money to a poor man , say apologetically , ' I hope it is no disgrace in me to be rich , as it is none in you to be poor . '
Parsing [sent. 2892 len. 38]: It is not the being rich that is wrong , but the serving of riches , instead of making them serve your neighbour and yourself -- your neighbour for this life , yourself for the everlasting habitations .
Parsing [sent. 2893 len. 33]: God knows it is hard for the rich man to enter into the kingdom of heaven ; but the rich man does sometimes enter in ; for God hath made it possible .
Parsing [sent. 2894 len. 17]: And the greater the victory , when it is the rich man that overcometh the world .
Parsing [sent. 2895 len. 34]: It is easier for the poor man to enter into the kingdom , yet many of the poor have failed to enter in , and the greater is the disgrace of their defeat .
Parsing [sent. 2896 len. 34]: For the poor have more done for them , as far as outward things go , in the way of salvation than the rich , and have a beatitude all to themselves besides .
Parsing [sent. 2897 len. 29]: For in the making of this world as a school of salvation , the poor , as the necessary majority , have been more regarded than the rich .
Parsing [sent. 2898 len. 15]: Do not think , my poor friend , that God will let you off .
Parsing [sent. 2899 len. 5]: He lets nobody off .
Parsing [sent. 2900 len. 10]: You , too , must pay the uttermost farthing .
Parsing [sent. 2901 len. 18]: He loves you too well to let you serve Mammon a whit more than your rich neighbour .
Parsing [sent. 2902 len. 5]: ` Serve Mammon ! '
Parsing [sent. 2903 len. 4]: do you say ?
Parsing [sent. 2904 len. 7]: ` How can I serve Mammon ?
Parsing [sent. 2905 len. 8]: I have no Mammon to serve . '
Parsing [sent. 2906 len. 15]: -- Would you like to have riches a moment sooner than God gives them ?
Parsing [sent. 2907 len. 9]: Would you serve Mammon if you had him ?
Parsing [sent. 2908 len. 7]: -- ` Who can tell ? '
Parsing [sent. 2909 len. 4]: do you answer ?
Parsing [sent. 2910 len. 10]: ` Leave those questions till I am tried . '
Parsing [sent. 2911 len. 12]: But is there no bitterness in the tone of that response ?
Parsing [sent. 2912 len. 22]: Does it not mean , ` It will be a long time before I have a chance of trying THAT ? '
Parsing [sent. 2913 len. 20]: -- But I am not driven to such questions for the chance of convicting some of you of Mammon-worship .
Parsing [sent. 2914 len. 7]: Let us look to the text .
Parsing [sent. 2915 len. 5]: Read it again . ''
Parsing [sent. 2916 len. 9]: ` YE CAN NOT SERVE GOD AND MAMMON .
Parsing [sent. 2917 len. 14]: THEREFORE I SAY UNTO YOU , TAKE NO THOUGHT FOR YOUR LIFE . '
Parsing [sent. 2918 len. 9]: `` Why are you to take no thought ?
Parsing [sent. 2919 len. 9]: Because you can not serve God and Mammon .
Parsing [sent. 2920 len. 11]: Is taking thought , then , a serving of Mammon ?
Parsing [sent. 2921 len. 2]: Clearly .
Parsing [sent. 2922 len. 9]: -- Where are you now , poor man ?
Parsing [sent. 2923 len. 5]: Brooding over the frost ?
Parsing [sent. 2924 len. 21]: Will it harden the ground , so that the God of the sparrows can not find food for His sons ?
Parsing [sent. 2925 len. 8]: Where are you now , poor woman ?
Parsing [sent. 2926 len. 10]: Sleepless over the empty cupboard and to-morrow 's dinner ?
Parsing [sent. 2927 len. 10]: ` It is because we have no bread ? '
Parsing [sent. 2928 len. 4]: do you answer ?
Parsing [sent. 2929 len. 18]: Have you forgotten the five loaves among the five thousand , and the fragments that were left ?
Parsing [sent. 2930 len. 20]: Or do you know nothing of your Father in heaven , who clothes the lilies and feeds the birds ?
Parsing [sent. 2931 len. 6]: O ye of little faith ?
Parsing [sent. 2932 len. 5]: O ye poor-spirited Mammon-worshippers !
Parsing [sent. 2933 len. 26]: who worship him not even because he has given you anything , but in the hope that he may some future day benignantly regard you .
Parsing [sent. 2934 len. 9]: But I may be too hard upon you .
Parsing [sent. 2935 len. 50]: I know well that our Father sees a great difference between the man who is anxious about his children 's dinner , or even about his own , and the man who is only anxious to add another ten thousand to his much goods laid up for many years .
Parsing [sent. 2936 len. 35]: But you ought to find it easy to trust in God for such a matter as your daily bread , whereas no man can by any possibility trust in God for ten thousand pounds .
Parsing [sent. 2937 len. 21]: The former need is a God-ordained necessity ; the latter desire a man-devised appetite at best -- possibly swinish greed .
Parsing [sent. 2938 len. 10]: Tell me , do you long to be rich ?
Parsing [sent. 2939 len. 5]: Then you worship Mammon .
Parsing [sent. 2940 len. 18]: Tell me , do you think you would feel safer if you had money in the bank ?
Parsing [sent. 2941 len. 26]: Then you are Mammon-worshippers ; for you would trust the barn of the rich man rather than the God who makes the corn to grow .
Parsing [sent. 2942 len. 10]: Do you say -- `` What shall we eat ?
Parsing [sent. 2943 len. 6]: and what shall we drink ?
Parsing [sent. 2944 len. 8]: and wherewithal shall we be clothedl ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2945 len. 7]: Are ye thus of doubtful mind ?
Parsing [sent. 2946 len. 6]: -- Then you are Mammon-worshippers .
Parsing [sent. 2947 len. 18]: `` But how is the work of the world to be done if we take no thought ?
Parsing [sent. 2948 len. 10]: -- We are nowhere told not to take thought .
Parsing [sent. 2949 len. 5]: We MUST take thought .
Parsing [sent. 2950 len. 16]: The question is -- What are we to take or not to take thought about ?
Parsing [sent. 2951 len. 24]: By some who do not know God , little work would be done if they were not driven by anxiety of some kind .
Parsing [sent. 2952 len. 38]: But you , friends , are you content to go with the nations of the earth , or do you seek a better way -- THE way that the Father of nations would have you walk in ?
Parsing [sent. 2953 len. 10]: `` WHAT then are we to take thought about ?
Parsing [sent. 2954 len. 6]: Why , about our work .
Parsing [sent. 2955 len. 9]: What are we not to take thought about ?
Parsing [sent. 2956 len. 6]: Why , about our life .
Parsing [sent. 2957 len. 12]: The one is our business : the other is God 's .
Parsing [sent. 2958 len. 8]: But you turn it the other way .
Parsing [sent. 2959 len. 34]: You take no thought of earnestness about the doing of your duty ; but you take thought of care lest God should not fulfil His part in the goings on of the world .
Parsing [sent. 2960 len. 21]: A man 's business is just to do his duty : God takes upon Himself the feeding and the clothing .
Parsing [sent. 2961 len. 48]: Will the work of the world be neglected if a man thinks of his work , his duty , God 's will to be done , instead of what he is to eat , what he is to drink , and wherewithal he is to be clothed ?
Parsing [sent. 2962 len. 14]: And remember all the needs of the world come back to these three .
Parsing [sent. 2963 len. 40]: You will allow , I think , that the work of the world will be only so much the better done ; that the very means of procuring the raiment or the food will be the more thoroughly used .
Parsing [sent. 2964 len. 15]: What , then , is the only region on which the doubt can settle ?
Parsing [sent. 2965 len. 4]: Why , God .
Parsing [sent. 2966 len. 7]: He alone remains to be doubted .
Parsing [sent. 2967 len. 7]: Shall it be so with you ?
Parsing [sent. 2968 len. 23]: Shall the Son of man , the baby now born , and for ever with us , find no faith in you ?
Parsing [sent. 2969 len. 34]: Ah , my poor friend , who canst not trust in God -- I was going to say you DESERVE -- but what do I know of you to condemn and judge you ?
Parsing [sent. 2970 len. 39]: -- I was going to say , you deserve to be treated like the child who frets and complains because his mother holds him on her knee and feeds him mouthful by mouthful with her own loving hand .
Parsing [sent. 2971 len. 52]: I meant -- you deserve to have your own way for a while ; to be set down , and told to help yourself , and see what it will come to ; to have your mother open the cupboard door for you , and leave you alone to your pleasures .
Parsing [sent. 2972 len. 2]: Alas !
Parsing [sent. 2973 len. 3]: poor child !
Parsing [sent. 2974 len. 38]: When the sweets begin to pall , and the twilight begins to come duskily into the chamber , and you look about all at once and see no mother , how will your cupboard comfort you then ?
Parsing [sent. 2975 len. 20]: Ask it for a smile , for a stroke of the gentle hand , for a word of love .
Parsing [sent. 2976 len. 39]: All the full-fed Mammon can give you is what your mother would have given you without the consequent loathing , with the light of her countenance upon it all , and the arm of her love around you .
Parsing [sent. 2977 len. 19]: -- And this is what God does sometimes , I think , with the Mammon-worshippers amongst the poor .
Parsing [sent. 2978 len. 16]: He says to them , Take your Mammon , and see what he is worth .
Parsing [sent. 2979 len. 17]: Ah , friends , the children of God can never be happy serving other than Him .
Parsing [sent. 2980 len. 18]: The prodigal might fill his belly with riotous living or with the husks that the swine ate .
Parsing [sent. 2981 len. 15]: It was all one , so long as he was not with his father .
Parsing [sent. 2982 len. 5]: His soul was wretched .
Parsing [sent. 2983 len. 42]: So would you be if you had wealth , for I fear you would only be worse Mammon-worshippers than now , and might well have to thank God for the misery of any swine-trough that could bring you to your senses .
Parsing [sent. 2984 len. 14]: `` But we do see people die of starvation sometimes , -- Yes .
Parsing [sent. 2985 len. 24]: But if you did your work in God 's name , and left the rest to Him , that would not trouble you .
Parsing [sent. 2986 len. 23]: You would say , If it be God 's will that I should starve , I can starve as well as another .
Parsing [sent. 2987 len. 8]: And your mind would be at ease .
Parsing [sent. 2988 len. 22]: `` Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed upon Thee , because he trusteth in Thee . ''
Parsing [sent. 2989 len. 6]: Of that I am sure .
Parsing [sent. 2990 len. 25]: It may be good for you to go hungry and bare-foot ; but it must be utter death to have no faith in God .
Parsing [sent. 2991 len. 25]: It is not , however , in God 's way of things that the man who does his work shall not live by it .
Parsing [sent. 2992 len. 35]: We do not know why here and there a man may be left to die of hunger , but I do believe that they who wait upon the Lord shall not lack any good .
Parsing [sent. 2993 len. 51]: What it may be good to deprive a man of till he knows and acknowledges whence it comes , it may be still better to give him when he has learned that every good and every perfect gift is from above , and cometh down from the Father of lights .
Parsing [sent. 2994 len. 32]: `` I SHOULD like to know a man who just minded his duty and troubled himself about nothing ; who did his own work and did not interfere with God 's .
Parsing [sent. 2995 len. 20]: How nobly he would work -- working not for reward , but because it was the will of God !
Parsing [sent. 2996 len. 18]: How happily he would receive his food and clothing , receiving them as the gifts of God !
Parsing [sent. 2997 len. 6]: What peace would be his !
Parsing [sent. 2998 len. 5]: What a sober gaiety !
Parsing [sent. 2999 len. 7]: How hearty and infectious his laughter !
Parsing [sent. 3000 len. 7]: What a friend he would be !
Parsing [sent. 3001 len. 5]: How sweet his sympathy !
Parsing [sent. 3002 len. 25]: And his mind would be so clear he would understand everything His eye being single , his whole body would be full of light .
Parsing [sent. 3003 len. 10]: No fear of his ever doing a mean thing .
Parsing [sent. 3004 len. 9]: He would die in a ditch , rather .
Parsing [sent. 3005 len. 13]: It is this fear of want that makes men do mean things .
Parsing [sent. 3006 len. 12]: They are afraid to part with their precious lord -- Mammon .
Parsing [sent. 3007 len. 9]: He gives no safety against such a fear .
Parsing [sent. 3008 len. 16]: One of the richest men in England is haunted with the dread of the workhouse .
Parsing [sent. 3009 len. 29]: This man whom I should like to know , would be sure that God would have him liberal , and he would be what God would have him .
Parsing [sent. 3010 len. 10]: Riches are not in the least necessary to that .
Parsing [sent. 3011 len. 14]: Witness our Lord 's admiration of the poor widow with her great farthing .
Parsing [sent. 3012 len. 83]: `` But I think I hear my troubled friend who does not love money , and yet can not trust in God out and out , though she fain would , -- I think I hear her say , `` I believe I could trust Him for myself , or at least I should be ready to dare the worst for His sake ; but my children -- it is the thought of my children that is too much for me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3013 len. 4]: Ah , woman !
Parsing [sent. 3014 len. 17]: she whom the Saviour praised so pleasedly , was one who trusted Him for her daughter .
Parsing [sent. 3015 len. 6]: What an honour she had !
Parsing [sent. 3016 len. 11]: `` Be it unto thee even as thou wilt . ''
Parsing [sent. 3017 len. 14]: Do you think you love your children better than He who made them ?
Parsing [sent. 3018 len. 16]: Is not your love what it is because He put it into your heart first ?
Parsing [sent. 3019 len. 9]: Have not you often been cross with them ?
Parsing [sent. 3020 len. 5]: Sometimes unjust to them ?
Parsing [sent. 3021 len. 23]: Whence came the returning love that rose from unknown depths in your being , and swept away the anger and the injustice !
Parsing [sent. 3022 len. 7]: You did not create that love .
Parsing [sent. 3023 len. 13]: Probably you were not good enough to send for it by prayer .
Parsing [sent. 3024 len. 4]: But it came .
Parsing [sent. 3025 len. 4]: God sent it .
Parsing [sent. 3026 len. 40]: He makes you love your children ; be sorry when you have been cross with them ; ashamed when you have been unjust to them ; and yet you wo n't trust Him to give them food and clothes !
Parsing [sent. 3027 len. 40]: Depend upon it , if He ever refuses to give them food and clothes , and you knew all about it , the why and the wherefore , you would not dare to give them food or clothes either .
Parsing [sent. 3028 len. 47]: He loves them a thousand times better than you do -- be sure of that -- and feels for their sufferings too , when He can not give them just what He would like to give them -- can not for their good , I mean .
Parsing [sent. 3029 len. 17]: `` But as your mistrust will go further , I can go further to meet it .
Parsing [sent. 3030 len. 7]: You will say , ` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 3031 len. 22]: yes ' -- in your feeling , I mean , not in words , -- you will say , ` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 3032 len. 9]: yes -- food and clothing of a sort !
Parsing [sent. 3033 len. 11]: Enough to keep life in and too much cold out !
Parsing [sent. 3034 len. 17]: But I want my children to have plenty of GOOD food , and NICE clothes . '
Parsing [sent. 3035 len. 4]: `` Faithless mother !
Parsing [sent. 3036 len. 7]: Consider the birds of the air .
Parsing [sent. 3037 len. 11]: They have so much that at least they can sing !
Parsing [sent. 3038 len. 11]: Consider the lilies -- they were red lilies , those .
Parsing [sent. 3039 len. 32]: Would you not trust Him who delights in glorious colours -- more at least than you , or He would never have created them and made us to delight in them ?
Parsing [sent. 3040 len. 37]: I do not say that your children shall be clothed in scarlet and fine linen ; but if not , it is not because God despises scarlet and fine linen or does not love your children .
Parsing [sent. 3041 len. 17]: He loves them , I say , too much to give them everything all at once .
Parsing [sent. 3042 len. 24]: But He would make them such that they may have everything without being the worse , and with being the better for it .
Parsing [sent. 3043 len. 19]: And if you can not trust Him yet , it begins to be a shame , I think .
Parsing [sent. 3044 len. 18]: `` It has been well said that no man ever sank under the burden of the day .
Parsing [sent. 3045 len. 25]: It is when to-morrow 's burden is added to the burden of to-day , that the weight is more than a man can bear .
Parsing [sent. 3046 len. 8]: Never load yourselves so , my friends .
Parsing [sent. 3047 len. 22]: If you find yourselves so loaded , at least remember this : it is your own doing , not God 's .
Parsing [sent. 3048 len. 15]: He begs you to leave the future to Him , and mind the present .
Parsing [sent. 3049 len. 15]: What more or what else could He do to take the burden off you ?
Parsing [sent. 3050 len. 6]: Nothing else would do it .
Parsing [sent. 3051 len. 9]: Money in the bank would n't do it .
Parsing [sent. 3052 len. 18]: He can not do to-morrow 's business for you beforehand to save you from fear about it .
Parsing [sent. 3053 len. 5]: That would derange everything .
Parsing [sent. 3054 len. 50]: What else is there but to tell you to trust in Him , irrespective of the fact that nothing else but such trust can put our heart at peace , from the very nature of our relation to Him as well as the fact that we need these things .
Parsing [sent. 3055 len. 17]: We think that we come nearer to God than the lower animals do by our foresight .
Parsing [sent. 3056 len. 8]: But there is another side to it .
Parsing [sent. 3057 len. 102]: We are like to Him with whom there is no past or future , with whom a day is as a thousand years , and a thousand years as one day , when we live with large bright spiritual eyes , doing our work in the great present , leaving both past and future to Him to whom they are ever present , and fearing nothing , because He is in our future , as much as He is in our past , as much as , and far more than , we can feel Him to be in our present .
Parsing [sent. 3058 len. 60]: Partakers thus of the divine nature , resting in that perfect All-in-all in whom our nature is eternal too , we walk without fear , full of hope and courage and strength to do His will , waiting for the endless good which He is always giving as fast as He can get us able to take it in .
Parsing [sent. 3059 len. 15]: Would not this be to be more of gods than Satan promised to Eve ?
Parsing [sent. 3060 len. 48]: To live carelessly-divine , duty-doing , fearless , loving , self-forgetting lives -- is not that more than to know both good and evil -- lives in which the good , like Aaron 's rod , has swallowed up the evil , and turned it into good ?
Parsing [sent. 3061 len. 24]: For pain and hunger are evils j but if faith in God swallows them up , do they not so turn into good ?
Parsing [sent. 3062 len. 5]: I say they do .
Parsing [sent. 3063 len. 18]: And I am glad to believe that I am not alone in my parish in this conviction .
Parsing [sent. 3064 len. 25]: I have never been too hungry , but I have had trouble which I would gladly have exchanged for hunger and cold and weariness .
Parsing [sent. 3065 len. 11]: Some of you have known hunger and cold and weariness .
Parsing [sent. 3066 len. 32]: Do you not join with me to say : It is well , and better than well -- whatever helps us to know the love of Him who is our God ?
Parsing [sent. 3067 len. 13]: `` But there HAS BEEN just one man who has acted thus .
Parsing [sent. 3068 len. 40]: And it is His Spirit in our hearts that makes us desire to know or to be another such -- who would do the will of God for God , and let God do God 's will for Him .
Parsing [sent. 3069 len. 6]: For His will is all .
Parsing [sent. 3070 len. 13]: And this man is the baby whose birth we celebrate this day .
Parsing [sent. 3071 len. 31]: Was this a condition to choose -- that of a baby -- by one who thought it part of a man 's high calling to take care of the morrow ?
Parsing [sent. 3072 len. 19]: Did He not thus cast the whole matter at once upor the hands and heart of His Father ?
Parsing [sent. 3073 len. 35]: Sufficient unto the baby 's day is the need thereof ; he toils not , neither does he spin , and yet he if fed and clothed , and loved , and rejoiced in .
Parsing [sent. 3074 len. 31]: Do you remind me that sometimes even his mother forgets him -- a mother , most likely , to whose self-indulgence or weakness the child owes his birth as hers ?
Parsing [sent. 3075 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 3076 len. 24]: but he is not therefore forgotten , however like things it may look to our half-seeing eyes , by his Father in heaven .
Parsing [sent. 3077 len. 37]: One of the highest benefits we can reap from understanding the way of God with ourselves is , that we become able thus to trust Him for others with whom we do not understand His ways .
Parsing [sent. 3078 len. 38]: `` But let us look at what will be more easily shown -- how , namely , He did the will of His Father , and took no thought for the morrow after He became a man .
Parsing [sent. 3079 len. 15]: Remember how He forsook His trade when the time came for Him to preach .
Parsing [sent. 3080 len. 7]: Preaching was not a profession then .
Parsing [sent. 3081 len. 13]: There were no monasteries , or vicarages , or stipends , then .
Parsing [sent. 3082 len. 20]: Yet witness for the Father the garment woven throughout ; the ministering of women ; the purse in common !
Parsing [sent. 3083 len. 21]: Hard-working men and rich ladies were ready to help Him , and did help Him with all that He needed .
Parsing [sent. 3084 len. 7]: -- Did He then never want ?
Parsing [sent. 3085 len. 12]: Yes ; once at least -- for a little while only .
Parsing [sent. 3086 len. 8]: `` He was a-hungered in the wilderness .
Parsing [sent. 3087 len. 8]: ` Make bread , ' said Satan .
Parsing [sent. 3088 len. 8]: ` No , ' said our Lord .
Parsing [sent. 3089 len. 27]: -- He could starve ; but He could not eat bread that His Father did not give Him , even though He could make it Himself .
Parsing [sent. 3090 len. 8]: He had come hither to be tried .
Parsing [sent. 3091 len. 9]: But when the victory was secure , lo !
Parsing [sent. 3092 len. 9]: the angels brought Him food from His Father .
Parsing [sent. 3093 len. 5]: -- Which was better ?
Parsing [sent. 3094 len. 11]: To feed Himself , or be fed by His Father ?
Parsing [sent. 3095 len. 2]: Judg ?
Parsing [sent. 3096 len. 23]: yourselves , jinxious people , He sought the kingdom of God and His righteousness , and the bread was added unto Him .
Parsing [sent. 3097 len. 27]: `` And this gives me occasion to remark that the same truth holds with regard to any portion of the future as well as the morrow .
Parsing [sent. 3098 len. 18]: It is a principle , not a command , or an encouragement , or a promise merely .
Parsing [sent. 3099 len. 21]: In respect of it there is no difference between next day and next year , next hour and next century .
Parsing [sent. 3100 len. 22]: You will see at once the absurdity of taking no thought for the morrow , and taking thought for next year .
Parsing [sent. 3101 len. 26]: But do you see likewise that it is equally reasonable to trust God for the next moment , and equally unreasonable not to trust Him ?
Parsing [sent. 3102 len. 19]: The Lord was hungry and needed food now , though He could still go without for a while .
Parsing [sent. 3103 len. 7]: He left it to His Father .
Parsing [sent. 3104 len. 19]: And so He told His disciples to do when they were called to answer before judges and rulers .
Parsing [sent. 3105 len. 5]: ` Take no thought .
Parsing [sent. 3106 len. 11]: It shall be given you what ye shall say . '
Parsing [sent. 3107 len. 11]: You have a disagreeable duty to do at twelve o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 3108 len. 19]: Do not blacken nine and ten and eleven , and all between , with the colour of twelve .
Parsing [sent. 3109 len. 13]: Do the work of each , and reap your reward in peace .
Parsing [sent. 3110 len. 29]: So when the dreaded moment in the future becomes the present , you shall meet it walking in the light , and that light will overcome its darkness .
Parsing [sent. 3111 len. 28]: How often do men who have made up their minds what to say and do under certain expected circumstances , forget the words and reverse the actions !
Parsing [sent. 3112 len. 15]: The best preparation is the present well seen to , the last duty done .
Parsing [sent. 3113 len. 100]: For this will keep the eye so clear and the body so full of light that the right action will be perceived at once , the right words will rush from the heart to the lips , and the man , full of the Spirit of God because he cares for nothing but the will of God , will trample on the evil thing in love , and be sent , it may be , in a chariot of fire to the presence of his Father , or stand unmoved amid the cruel mockings of the men he loves .
Parsing [sent. 3114 len. 33]: `` Do you feel inclined to say in your hearts : ` It was easy for Him to take no thought , for He had the matter in His own hands ? '
Parsing [sent. 3115 len. 21]: But observe , there is nothing very noble in a man 's taking no thought except it be from faith .
Parsing [sent. 3116 len. 24]: If there were no God to take thought for us , we should have no right to blame any one for taking thought .
Parsing [sent. 3117 len. 14]: You may fancy the Lord had His own power to fall back upon .
Parsing [sent. 3118 len. 13]: But that would have been to Him just the one dreadful thing .
Parsing [sent. 3119 len. 7]: That His Father should forget Him !
Parsing [sent. 3120 len. 11]: -- no power in Himself could make up for that .
Parsing [sent. 3121 len. 21]: He feared nothing for Himself ; and never once employed His divine power to save Him from His human fate .
Parsing [sent. 3122 len. 11]: Let God do that for Him if He saw fit .
Parsing [sent. 3123 len. 13]: He did not come into the world to take care of Himself .
Parsing [sent. 3124 len. 9]: That would not be in any way divine .
Parsing [sent. 3125 len. 22]: To fall back on Himself , God failing Him -- how could that make it easy for Him to avoid care ?
Parsing [sent. 3126 len. 7]: The very idea would be torture .
Parsing [sent. 3127 len. 15]: That would be to declare heaven void , and the world without a God .
Parsing [sent. 3128 len. 21]: He would not even pray to His Father for what He knew He should have if He did ask it .
Parsing [sent. 3129 len. 7]: He would just wait His will .
Parsing [sent. 3130 len. 22]: `` But see how the fact of His own power adds tenfold significance to the fact that He trusted in God .
Parsing [sent. 3131 len. 41]: We see that this power would not serve His need -- His need not being to be fed and clothed , but to be one with the Father , to be fed by His hand , clothed by His care .
Parsing [sent. 3132 len. 13]: This was what the Lord wanted -- and we need , alas !
Parsing [sent. 3133 len. 6]: too often without wanting it .
Parsing [sent. 3134 len. 13]: He never once , I repeat , used His power for Himself .
Parsing [sent. 3135 len. 6]: That was not his business .
Parsing [sent. 3136 len. 7]: He did not care about it .
Parsing [sent. 3137 len. 16]: His life was of no value to Him but as His Father cared for it .
Parsing [sent. 3138 len. 24]: God would mind all that was necessary for Him , and He would mind the work His Father had given Him to do .
Parsing [sent. 3139 len. 28]: And , my friends , this is just the one secret of a blessed life , the one thing every man comes into this world to learn .
Parsing [sent. 3140 len. 25]: With what authority it comes to us from the lips of Him who knew all about it , and ever did as He said !
Parsing [sent. 3141 len. 13]: `` Now you see that He took no thought for the morrow .
Parsing [sent. 3142 len. 162]: And , in the name of the holy child Jesus , I call upon you , this Christmas day , to cast care to the winds , and trust in God ; to receive the message of peace and good-will to men ; to yield yourselves to the Spirit of God , that you may be taught what He wants you to know ; to remember that the one gift promised without reserve to those who ask it -- the one gift worth having -- the gift which makes all other gifts a thousand-fold in value , is the gift of the Holy Spirit , the spirit of the child Jesus , who will take of the things of Jesus , and show them to you -- make you understand them , that is -- so that you shall see them to be true , and love Him with all your heart and soul , and your neighbour as yourselves . ''
Parsing [sent. 3143 len. 31]: And here , having finished my sermon , I will give my reader some lines with which he may not be acquainted , from a writer of the Elizabethan time .
Parsing [sent. 3144 len. 24]: I had meant to introduce them into my sermon , but I was so carried away with my subject that I forgot them .
Parsing [sent. 3145 len. 33]: For I always preached extempore , which phrase I beg my reader will not misinterpret as meaning ON THE SPUR OF THE MOMENT , OF WITHOUT THE DUE PREPARATION OF MUCH THOUGHT .
Parsing [sent. 3146 len. 4]: `` O man !
Parsing [sent. 3147 len. 25]: thou image of thy Maker 's good , What canst thou fear , when breathed into thy blood His Spirit is that built thee ?
Parsing [sent. 3148 len. 73]: What dull sense Makes thee suspect , in need , that Providence Who made the morning , and who placed the light Guide to thy labours ; who called up the night , And bid her fall upon thee like sweet showers , In hollow murmurs , to lock up thy powers ; Who gave thee knowledge ; who so trusted thee To let thee grow so near Himself , the Tree ?
Parsing [sent. 3149 len. 6]: Must He then be distrusted ?
Parsing [sent. 3150 len. 13]: Shall His frame Discourse with Him why thus and thus I am ?
Parsing [sent. 3151 len. 19]: He made the Angels thine , thy fellows all ; Nay even thy servants , when devotions call .
Parsing [sent. 3152 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 3153 len. 21]: canst thou be so stupid then , so dim , To seek a saving * influence , and lose Him ?
Parsing [sent. 3154 len. 5]: Can stars protect thee ?
Parsing [sent. 3155 len. 16]: Or can poverty , Which is the light to heaven , put out His eye !
Parsing [sent. 3156 len. 18]: He is my star ; in Him all truth I find , All influence , all fate .
Parsing [sent. 3157 len. 24]: And when my mind Is furnished with His fulness , my poor story Shall outlive all their age , and all their glory .
Parsing [sent. 3158 len. 43]: The hand of danger can not fall amiss , When I know what , and in whose power , it is , Nor want , the curse of man , shall make me groan : A holy hermit is a mind alone .
Parsing [sent. 3159 len. 63]: * * * * Affliction , when I know it , is but this , A deep alloy whereby man tougher is To bear the hammer ; and the deeper still , We still arise more image of His will ; Sickness , an humorous cloud ` twixt us and light ; And death , at longest , but another night . ''
Parsing [sent. 3160 len. 15]: -LSB- Footnote * : Many , in those days , believed in astrology . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 3161 len. 30]: I had more than ordinary attention during my discourse , at one point in which I saw the down-bent head of Catherine Weir sink yet lower upon her hands .
Parsing [sent. 3162 len. 23]: After a moment , however , she sat more erect than before , though she never lifted her eyes to meet mine .
Parsing [sent. 3163 len. 26]: I need not assure my reader that she was not present to my mind when I spoke the words that so far had moved her .
Parsing [sent. 3164 len. 15]: Indeed , had I thought of her , I could not have spoken them .
Parsing [sent. 3165 len. 20]: As I came out of the church , my people crowded about me with outstretched hands and good wishes .
Parsing [sent. 3166 len. 41]: One woman , the aged wife of a more aged labourer , who could not get near me , called from the outskirts of the little crowd -- `` May the Lord come and see ye every day , sir .
Parsing [sent. 3167 len. 18]: And may ye never know the hunger and cold as me and Tomkins has come through . ''
Parsing [sent. 3168 len. 18]: `` Amen to the first of your blessing , Mrs Tomkins , and hearty thanks to you .
Parsing [sent. 3169 len. 24]: But I dare n't say AMEN to the other part of it , after what I 've been preaching , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 3170 len. 17]: `` But there 'll be no harm if I say it for ye , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3171 len. 23]: `` No , for God will give me what is good , even if your kind heart should pray against it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3172 len. 19]: `` Ah , sir , ye do n't know what it is to be hungry AND cold . ''
Parsing [sent. 3173 len. 14]: `` Neither shall you any more , if I can help it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3174 len. 7]: `` God bless ye , sir .
Parsing [sent. 3175 len. 11]: But we 're pretty tidy just in the meantime . ''
Parsing [sent. 3176 len. 14]: I walked home , as usual on Sunday mornings , by the road .
Parsing [sent. 3177 len. 6]: It was a lovely day .
Parsing [sent. 3178 len. 37]: The sun shone so warm that you could not help thinking of what he would be able to do before long -- draw primroses and buttercups out of the earth by force of sweet persuasive influences .
Parsing [sent. 3179 len. 39]: But in the shadows lay fine webs and laces of ice , so delicately lovely that one could not but be glad of the cold that made the water able to please itself by taking such graceful forms .
Parsing [sent. 3180 len. 37]: And I wondered over again for the hundredth time what could be the principle which , in the wildest , most lawless , fantastically chaotic , apparently capricious work of nature , always kept it beautiful .
Parsing [sent. 3181 len. 16]: The beauty of holiness must be at the heart of it somehow , I thought .
Parsing [sent. 3182 len. 66]: Because our God is so free from stain , so loving , so unselfish , so good , so altogether what He wants us to be , so holy , therefore all His works declare Him in beauty ; His fingers can touch nothing but to mould it into loveliness ; and even the play of His elements is in grace and tenderness of form .
Parsing [sent. 3183 len. 66]: And then I thought how the sun , at the farthest point from us , had begun to come back towards us ; looked upon us with a hopeful smile ; was like the Lord when He visited His people as a little one of themselves , to grow upon the earth till it should blossom as the rose in the light of His presence .
Parsing [sent. 3184 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 3185 len. 17]: Lord , '' I said , in my heart , `` draw near unto Thy people .
Parsing [sent. 3186 len. 31]: It is spring-time with Thy world , but yet we have cold winds and bitter hail , and pinched voices forbidding them that follow Thee and follow not with us .
Parsing [sent. 3187 len. 45]: Draw nearer , Sun of Righteousness , and make the trees bourgeon , and the flowers blossom , and the voices grow mellow and glad , so that all shall join in praising Thee , and find thereby that harmony is better than unison .
Parsing [sent. 3188 len. 21]: Let it be summer , O Lord , if it ever may be summer in this court of the Gentiles .
Parsing [sent. 3189 len. 22]: But Thou hast told us that Thy kingdom cometh within us , and so Thy joy must come within us too .
Parsing [sent. 3190 len. 40]: Draw nigh then , Lord , to those to whom Thou wilt draw nigh ; and others beholding their welfare will seek to share therein too , and seeing their good works will glorify their Father in heaven . ''
Parsing [sent. 3191 len. 29]: So I walked home , hoping in my Saviour , and wondering to think how pleasant I had found it to be His poor servant to this people .
Parsing [sent. 3192 len. 44]: Already the doubts which had filled my mind on that first evening of gloom , doubts as to whether I had any right to the priest 's office , had utterly vanished , slain by the effort to perform the priest 's duty .
Parsing [sent. 3193 len. 8]: I never thought about the matter now .
Parsing [sent. 3194 len. 13]: -- And how can doubt ever be fully met but by action ?
Parsing [sent. 3195 len. 24]: Try your theory ; try your hypothesis ; or if it is not worth trying , give it up , pull it down .
Parsing [sent. 3196 len. 63]: And I hoped that if ever a cloud should come over me again , however dark and dismal it might be , I might be able , notwithstanding , to rejoice that the sun was shining on others though not on me , and to say with all my heart to my Father in heaven , `` Thy will be done . ''
Parsing [sent. 3197 len. 45]: When I reached my own study , I sat down by a blazing fire , and poured myself out a glass of wine ; for I had to go out again to see some of my poor friends , and wanted some luncheon first .
Parsing [sent. 3198 len. 19]: -- It is a great thing to have the greetings of the universe presented in fire and food .
Parsing [sent. 3199 len. 50]: Let me , if I may , be ever welcomed to my room in winter by a glowing hearth , in summer by a vase of flowers ; if I may not , let me then think how nice they would be , and bury myself in my work .
Parsing [sent. 3200 len. 18]: I do not think that the road to contentment lies in despising what we have not got .
Parsing [sent. 3201 len. 19]: Let us acknowledge all good , all delight that the world holds , and be content without it .
Parsing [sent. 3202 len. 40]: But this we can never be except by possessing the one thing , without which I do not merely say no man ought to be content , but no man CAN be content -- the Spirit of the Father .
Parsing [sent. 3203 len. 59]: If any young people read my little chronicle , will they not be inclined to say , `` The vicar has already given us in this chapter hardly anything but a long sermon ; and it is too bad of him to go on preaching in his study after we saw him safe out of the pulpit '' ?
Parsing [sent. 3204 len. 4]: Ah , well !
Parsing [sent. 3205 len. 13]: just one word , and I drop the preaching for a while .
Parsing [sent. 3206 len. 123]: My word is this : I may speak long-windedly , and even inconsiderately as regards my young readers ; what I say may fail utterly to convey what I mean ; I may be actually stupid sometimes , and not have a suspicion of it ; but what I mean is true ; and if you do not know it to be true yet , some of you at least suspect it to be true , and some of you hope it is true ; and when you all see it as I mean it and as you can take it , you will rejoice with a gladness you know nothing about now There , I have done for a little while .
Parsing [sent. 3207 len. 12]: I wo n't pledge myself for more , I assure you .
Parsing [sent. 3208 len. 32]: For to speak about such things is the greatest delight of my age , as it was of my early manhood , next to that of loving God and my neighbour .
Parsing [sent. 3209 len. 20]: For as these are THE two commandments of life , so they are in themselves THE pleasures of life .
Parsing [sent. 3210 len. 8]: But there I am at it again .
Parsing [sent. 3211 len. 15]: I beg your pardon now , for I have already inadvertently broken my promise .
Parsing [sent. 3212 len. 52]: I had allowed myself a half-hour before the fire with my glass of wine and piece of bread , and I soon fell into a dreamy state called REVERIE , which I fear not a few mistake for THINKING , because it is the nearest approach they ever make to it .
Parsing [sent. 3213 len. 11]: And in this reverie I kept staring about my book-shelves .
Parsing [sent. 3214 len. 56]: I am an old man now , and you do not know my name ; and if you should ever find it out , I shall very soon hide it under some daisies , I hope , and so escape ; and therefore , I am going to be egotistic in the most unpardonable manner .
Parsing [sent. 3215 len. 40]: I am going to tell you one of my faults , for it continues , I fear , to be one of my faults still , as it certainly was at the period of which I am now writing .
Parsing [sent. 3216 len. 7]: I am very fond of books .
Parsing [sent. 3217 len. 5]: Do not mistake me .
Parsing [sent. 3218 len. 9]: I do not mean that I love reading .
Parsing [sent. 3219 len. 5]: I hope I do .
Parsing [sent. 3220 len. 12]: That is no fault -- a virtue rather than a fault .
Parsing [sent. 3221 len. 36]: But , as the old meaning of the word FOND was FOOLISH , I use that word : I am foolishly fond of the bodies of books as distinguished from their souls , or thought-element .
Parsing [sent. 3222 len. 48]: I do not say I love their bodies as DIVIDED from their souls ; I do not say I should let a book stand upon my shelves for which I felt no respect , except indeed it happened to be useful to me in some inferior way .
Parsing [sent. 3223 len. 41]: But I delight in seeing books about me , books even of which there seems to be no prospect that I shall have time to read a single chapter before I lay this old head down for the last time .
Parsing [sent. 3224 len. 41]: Nay , more : I confess that if they are nicely bound , so as to glow and shine in such a fire-light as that by which I was then sitting , I like them ever so much the better .
Parsing [sent. 3225 len. 69]: Nay , more yet -- and this comes very near to showing myself worse than I thought I was when I began to tell you my fault : there are books upon my shelves which certainly at least would not occupy the place of honour they do occupy , had not some previous owner dressed them far beyond their worth , making modern apples of Sodom of them .
Parsing [sent. 3226 len. 27]: Yet there I let them stay , because they are pleasant to the eye , although certainly not things to be desired to make one wise .
Parsing [sent. 3227 len. 27]: I could say a great deal more about the matter , pro and con , but it would be worse than a sermon , I fear .
Parsing [sent. 3228 len. 84]: For I suspect that by the time books , which ought to be loved for the truth that is in them , of one sort or another , come to be loved as articles of furniture , the mind has gone through a process more than analogous to that which the miser 's mind goes through -- namely , that of passing from the respect of money because of what it can do , to the love of money because it is money .
Parsing [sent. 3229 len. 18]: I have not yet reached the furniture stage , and I do not think I ever shall .
Parsing [sent. 3230 len. 7]: I would rather burn them all .
Parsing [sent. 3231 len. 33]: Meantime , I think one safeguard is to encourage one 's friends to borrow one 's books -- not to offer individual books , which is much the same as OFFERING advice .
Parsing [sent. 3232 len. 32]: That will probably take some of the shine off them , and put a few thumb-marks in them , which both are very wholesome towards the arresting of the furniture declension .
Parsing [sent. 3233 len. 20]: For my part , thumb-marks I find very obnoxious -- far more so than the spoiling of the binding .
Parsing [sent. 3234 len. 55]: -- I know that some of my readers , who have had sad experience of the sort , will be saying in themselves , `` He might have mentioned a surer antidote resulting from this measure , than either rubbed Russia or dirty GLOVE-marks even -- that of utter disappearance and irreparable loss . ''
Parsing [sent. 3235 len. 34]: But no ; that has seldom happened to me -- because I trust my pocketbook , and never my memory , with the names of those to whom the individual books are committed .
Parsing [sent. 3236 len. 19]: -- There , then , is a little bit of practical advice in both directions for young book-lovers .
Parsing [sent. 3237 len. 10]: Again I am reminded that I am getting old .
Parsing [sent. 3238 len. 3]: What digressions !
Parsing [sent. 3239 len. 35]: Gazing about on my treasures , the thought suddenly struck me that I had never done as I had promised Judy ; had never found out what her aunt 's name meant in Anglo-Saxon .
Parsing [sent. 3240 len. 6]: I would do so now .
Parsing [sent. 3241 len. 17]: I got down my dictionary , and soon discovered that Ethelwyn meant Home-joy , or Inheritance .
Parsing [sent. 3242 len. 11]: `` A lovely meaning , '' I said to myself .
Parsing [sent. 3243 len. 60]: And then I went off into another reverie , with the composition of which I shall not trouble my reader ; and with the mention of which I had , perhaps , no right to occupy the fragment of his time spent in reading it , seeing I did not intend to tell him how it was made up .
Parsing [sent. 3244 len. 8]: I will tell him something else instead .
Parsing [sent. 3245 len. 52]: Several families had asked me to take my Christmas dinner with them ; but , not liking to be thus limited , I had answered each that I would not , if they would excuse me , but would look in some time or other in the course of the evening .
Parsing [sent. 3246 len. 32]: When my half-hour was out , I got up and filled my pockets with little presents for my poor people , and set out to find them in their own homes .
Parsing [sent. 3247 len. 41]: I was variously received , but unvaryingly with kindness ; and my little presents were accepted , at least in most instances , with a gratitude which made me ashamed of them and of myself too for a few moments .
Parsing [sent. 3248 len. 69]: Mrs. Tomkins looked as if she had never seen so much tea together before , though there was only a couple of pounds of it ; and her husband received a pair of warm trousers none the less cordially that they were not quite new , the fact being that I found I did not myself need such warm clothing this winter as I had needed the last .
Parsing [sent. 3249 len. 38]: I did not dare to offer Catherine Weir anything , but I gave her little boy a box of water-colours -- in remembrance of the first time I saw him , though I said nothing about that .
Parsing [sent. 3250 len. 7]: His mother did not thank me .
Parsing [sent. 3251 len. 15]: She told little Gerard to do so , however , and that was something .
Parsing [sent. 3252 len. 15]: And , indeed , the boy 's sweetness would have been enough for both .
Parsing [sent. 3253 len. 22]: Gerard -- an unusual name in England ; specially not to be looked for in the class to which she belonged .
Parsing [sent. 3254 len. 93]: When I reached Old Rogers 's cottage , whither I carried a few yards of ribbon , bought by myself , I assure my lady friends , with the special object that the colour should be bright enough for her taste , and pure enough of its kind for mine , as an offering to the good dame , and a small hymn-book , in which were some hymns of my own making , for the good man -- But do forgive me , friends , for actually describing my paltry presents .
Parsing [sent. 3255 len. 29]: I can dare to assure you it comes from a talking old man 's love of detail , and from no admiration of such small givings as those .
Parsing [sent. 3256 len. 15]: You see I trust you , and I want to stand well with you .
Parsing [sent. 3257 len. 39]: I never could be indifferent to what people thought of me ; though I have had to fight hard to act as freely as if I were indifferent , especially when upon occasion I found myself approved of .
Parsing [sent. 3258 len. 17]: It is more difficult to walk straight then , than when men are all against you .
Parsing [sent. 3259 len. 126]: -- As I have already broken a sentence , which will not be past setting for a while yet , I may as well go on to say here , lest any one should remark that a clergyman ought not to show off his virtues , nor yet teach his people bad habits by making them look out for presents -- that my income not only seemed to me disproportioned to the amount of labour necessary in the parish , but certainly was larger than I required to spend upon myself ; and the miserly passion for books I contrived to keep a good deal in check ; for I had no fancy for gliding devil-wards for the sake of a few books after all .
Parsing [sent. 3260 len. 10]: So there was no great virtue -- was there ?
Parsing [sent. 3261 len. 38]: -- in easing my heart by giving a few of the good things people give their children to my poor friends , whose kind reception of them gave me as much pleasure as the gifts gave them .
Parsing [sent. 3262 len. 20]: They valued the kindness in the gift , and to look out for kindness will not make people greedy .
Parsing [sent. 3263 len. 81]: When I reached the cottage , I found not merely Jane there with her father and mother , which was natural on Christmas Day , seeing there seemed to be no company at the Hall , but my little Judy as well , sitting in the old woman 's arm-chair , -LRB- not that she Used it much , but it was called hers , -RRB- and looking as much at home as -- as she did in the pond .
Parsing [sent. 3264 len. 6]: `` Why , Judy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3265 len. 8]: I exclaimed , `` you here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3266 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 3267 len. 7]: Why not , Mr Walton ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3268 len. 64]: she returned , holding out her hand without rising , for the chair was such a large one , and she was set so far back in it that the easier way was not to rise , which , seeing she was not greatly overburdened with reverence , was not , I presume , a cause of much annoyance to the little damsel .
Parsing [sent. 3269 len. 15]: `` I know no reason why I should n't see a Sandwich Islander here .
Parsing [sent. 3270 len. 16]: Yet I might express surprise if I did find one , might I not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3271 len. 15]: Judy pretended to pout , and muttered something about comparing her to a cannibal .
Parsing [sent. 3272 len. 7]: But Jane took up the explanation .
Parsing [sent. 3273 len. 37]: `` Mistress had to go off to London with her mother to-day , sir , quite unexpected , on some banking business , I fancy , from what I -- I beg your pardon , sir .
Parsing [sent. 3274 len. 31]: They 're gone anyhow , whatever the reason may be ; and so I came to see my father and mother , and Miss Judy would come with me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3275 len. 11]: `` She 's very welcome , '' said Mrs Rogers .
Parsing [sent. 3276 len. 18]: `` How could I stay up there with nobody but Jacob , and that old wolf Sarah ?
Parsing [sent. 3277 len. 12]: I would n't be left alone with her for the world .
Parsing [sent. 3278 len. 18]: She 'd have me in the Bishop 's Pool before you came back , Janey dear . ''
Parsing [sent. 3279 len. 15]: `` That would n't matter much to you , would it , Judy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3280 len. 3]: I said .
Parsing [sent. 3281 len. 15]: `` She 's a white wolf , that old Sarah , I know ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3282 len. 5]: was all her answer .
Parsing [sent. 3283 len. 19]: `` But what will the old lady say when she finds you brought the young lady here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3284 len. 4]: asked Mrs Rogers .
Parsing [sent. 3285 len. 9]: `` I did n't bring her , mother .
Parsing [sent. 3286 len. 5]: She would come . ''
Parsing [sent. 3287 len. 13]: `` Besides , she 'll never know it , '' said Judy .
Parsing [sent. 3288 len. 35]: I did not see that it was my part to read Judy a lecture here , though perhaps I might have done so if I had had more influence over her than I had .
Parsing [sent. 3289 len. 50]: I wanted to gain some influence over her , and knew that the way to render my desire impossible of fulfilment would be , to find fault with what in her was a very small affair , whatever it might be in one who had been properly brought up .
Parsing [sent. 3290 len. 10]: Besides , a clergyman is not a moral policeman .
Parsing [sent. 3291 len. 9]: So I took no notice of the impropriety .
Parsing [sent. 3292 len. 15]: `` Had they actually to go away on the morning of Christmas Day ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3293 len. 3]: I said .
Parsing [sent. 3294 len. 20]: `` They went anyhow , whether they had to do it or not , sir , '' answered Jane .
Parsing [sent. 3295 len. 15]: `` Aunt Ethelwyn did n't want to go till to-morrow , '' said Judy .
Parsing [sent. 3296 len. 11]: `` She said something about coming to church this morning .
Parsing [sent. 3297 len. 9]: But grannie said they must go at once .
Parsing [sent. 3298 len. 8]: It was very cross of old grannie .
Parsing [sent. 3299 len. 14]: Think what a Christmas Day to me without auntie , and with Sarah !
Parsing [sent. 3300 len. 14]: But I do n't mean to go home till it 's quite dark .
Parsing [sent. 3301 len. 15]: I mean to stop here with dear Old Rogers -- that I do . ''
Parsing [sent. 3302 len. 12]: The latch was gently lifted , and in came young Brownrigg .
Parsing [sent. 3303 len. 17]: So I thought it was time to leave my best Christmas wishes and take myself away .
Parsing [sent. 3304 len. 11]: Old Rogers came with me to the mill-stream as usual .
Parsing [sent. 3305 len. 34]: `` It ` mazes me , sir , '' he said , `` a gentleman o ' your age and bringin ' up to know all that you tould us this mornin ' .
Parsing [sent. 3306 len. 86]: It ` ud be no wonder now for a man like me , come to be the shock o ' corn fully ripe -- leastways yallow and white enough outside if there bea n't much more than milk inside it yet , -- it ` ud be no mystery for a man like me who 'd been brought up hard , and tossed about well-nigh all the world over -- why , there 's scarce a wave on the Atlantic but knows Old Rogers ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3307 len. 12]: He made the parenthesis with a laugh , and began anew .
Parsing [sent. 3308 len. 113]: `` It ` ud be a shame of a man like me not to know all as you said this mornin ' , sir -- leastways I do n't mean able to say it right off as you do , sir ; but not to know it , after the Almighty had been at such pains to beat it into my hard head just to trust in Him and fear nothing and nobody -- captain , bosun , devil , sunk rock , or breakers ahead ; but just to mind Him and stand by halliard , brace , or wheel , or hang on by the leeward earing for that matter .
Parsing [sent. 3309 len. 26]: For , you see , what does it signify whether I go to the bottom or not , so long as I did n't skulk ?
Parsing [sent. 3310 len. 36]: or rather , '' and here the old man took off his hat and looked up , `` so long as the Great Captain has His way , and things is done to His mind ?
Parsing [sent. 3311 len. 77]: But how ever a man like you , goin ' to the college , and readin ' books , and warm o ' nights , and never , by your own confession this blessed mornin ' , sir , knowin ' what it was to be downright hungry , how ever you come to know all those things , is just past my comprehension , except by a double portion o ' the Spirit , sir .
Parsing [sent. 3312 len. 13]: And that 's the way I account for it , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 3313 len. 25]: Although I knew enough about a ship to understand the old man , I am not sure that I have properly represented his sea-phrase .
Parsing [sent. 3314 len. 15]: But that is of small consequence , so long as I give his meaning .
Parsing [sent. 3315 len. 14]: And a meaning can occasionally be even better CONVEYED by less accurate words .
Parsing [sent. 3316 len. 23]: `` I will try to tell you how I come to know about these things as I do , '' I returned .
Parsing [sent. 3317 len. 18]: `` How my knowledge may stand the test of further and severer trials remains to be seen .
Parsing [sent. 3318 len. 34]: But if I should fail any time , old friend , and neither trust in God nor do my duty , what I have said to you remains true all the same . ''
Parsing [sent. 3319 len. 13]: `` That it do , sir , whoever may come short . ''
Parsing [sent. 3320 len. 21]: `` And more than that : failure does not necessarily prove any one to be a hypocrite of no faith .
Parsing [sent. 3321 len. 11]: He may be still a man of little faith . ''
Parsing [sent. 3322 len. 7]: `` Surely , surely , sir .
Parsing [sent. 3323 len. 16]: I remember once that my faith broke down -- just for one moment , sir .
Parsing [sent. 3324 len. 19]: And then the Lord gave me my way lest I should blaspheme Him in thy wicked heart . ''
Parsing [sent. 3325 len. 8]: `` How was that , Rogers ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3326 len. 18]: `` A scream came from the quarter-deck , and then the cry : ` Child overboard ! '
Parsing [sent. 3327 len. 12]: There was but one child , the captain 's , aboard .
Parsing [sent. 3328 len. 16]: I was sitting just aft the foremast , herring-boning a split in a spare jib .
Parsing [sent. 3329 len. 27]: I sprang to the bulwark , and there , sure enough , was the child , going fast astarn , but pretty high in the water .
Parsing [sent. 3330 len. 57]: How it happened I ca n't think to this day , sir , but I suppose my needle , in the hurry , had got into my jacket , so as to skewer it to my jersey , for we were far south of the line at the time , sir , and it was cold .
Parsing [sent. 3331 len. 50]: However that may be , as soon as I was overboard , which you may be sure did n't want the time I take tellin ' of it , I found that I ought to ha ' pulled my jacket off afore I gave the bulwark the last kick .
Parsing [sent. 3332 len. 35]: So I rose on the water , and began to pull it over my head -- for it was wide , and that was the easiest way , I thought , in the water .
Parsing [sent. 3333 len. 15]: But when I had got it right over my head , there it stuck .
Parsing [sent. 3334 len. 35]: And there was I , blind as a Dutchman in a fog , and in as strait a jacket as ever poor wretch in Bedlam , for I could only just wag my flippers .
Parsing [sent. 3335 len. 13]: Mr Walton , I believe I swore -- the Lord forgive me !
Parsing [sent. 3336 len. 6]: -- but it was trying .
Parsing [sent. 3337 len. 30]: And what was far worse , for one moment I disbelieved in Him ; and I do say that 's worse than swearing -- in a hurry I mean .
Parsing [sent. 3338 len. 30]: And that moment something went , the jacket was off , and there was I feelin ' as if every stroke I took was as wide as the mainyard .
Parsing [sent. 3339 len. 12]: I had no time to repent , only to thank God .
Parsing [sent. 3340 len. 11]: And was n't it more than I deserved , sir ?
Parsing [sent. 3341 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 3342 len. 16]: He can rebuke a man for unbelief by giving him the desire of his heart .
Parsing [sent. 3343 len. 15]: And that 's a better rebuke than tying him up to the gratings . ''
Parsing [sent. 3344 len. 9]: `` And did you save the child ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3345 len. 7]: `` Oh yes , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 3346 len. 9]: `` And was n't the captain pleased ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3347 len. 8]: `` I believe he was , sir .
Parsing [sent. 3348 len. 11]: He gave me a glass o ' grog , sir .
Parsing [sent. 3349 len. 18]: But you was a sayin ' of something , sir , when I interrupted of you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3350 len. 11]: `` I am very glad you did interrupt me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3351 len. 8]: `` I 'm not though , sir .
Parsing [sent. 3352 len. 11]: I Ve lost summat I 'll never hear more . ''
Parsing [sent. 3353 len. 9]: `` No , you sha n't lose it .
Parsing [sent. 3354 len. 25]: I was going to tell you how I think I came to understand a little about the things I was talking of to-day . ''
Parsing [sent. 3355 len. 11]: `` That 's it , sir ; that 's it .
Parsing [sent. 3356 len. 9]: Well , sir , if you please ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3357 len. 17]: `` You 've heard of Sir Philip Sidney , have n't you , Old Rogers ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3358 len. 14]: `` He was a great joker , was n't he , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3359 len. 15]: `` No , no ; you 're thinking of Sydney Smith , Rogers . ''
Parsing [sent. 3360 len. 7]: `` It may be , sir .
Parsing [sent. 3361 len. 7]: I am an ignorant man . ''
Parsing [sent. 3362 len. 12]: `` You are no more ignorant than you ought to be .
Parsing [sent. 3363 len. 19]: -- But it is time you should know him , for he was just one of your sort .
Parsing [sent. 3364 len. 13]: I will come down some evening and tell you about him . ''
Parsing [sent. 3365 len. 58]: I may as well mention here that this led to week-evening lectures in the barn , which , with the help of Weir the carpenter , was changed into a comfortable room , with fixed seats all round it , and plenty of cane-chairs besides -- for I always disliked forms in the middle of a room .
Parsing [sent. 3366 len. 25]: The object of these lectures was to make the people acquainted with the true heroes of their own country -- men great in themselves .
Parsing [sent. 3367 len. 50]: And the kind of choice I made may be seen by those who know about both , from the fact that , while my first two lectures were on Philip Sidney , I did not give one whole lecture even to Walter Raleigh , grand fellow as he was .
Parsing [sent. 3368 len. 22]: I wanted chiefly to set forth the men that could rule themselves , first of all , after a noble fashion .
Parsing [sent. 3369 len. 117]: But I have not finished these lectures yet , for I never wished to confine them to the English heroes ; I am going on still , old man as I am -- not however without retracing passed ground sometimes , for a new generation has come up since I came here , and there is a new one behind coming up now which I may be honoured to present in its turn to some of this grand company -- this cloud of witnesses to the truth in our own and other lands , some of whom subdued kingdoms , and others were tortured to death , for the same cause and with the same result .
Parsing [sent. 3370 len. 40]: `` Meantime , '' I went on , `` I only want to tell you one little thing he says in a letter to a younger brother whom he wanted to turn out as fine a fellow as possible .
Parsing [sent. 3371 len. 50]: It is about horses , or rather , riding -- for Sir Philip was the best horseman in Europe in his day , as , indeed , all things taken together , he seems to have really been the most accomplished man generally of his time in the world .
Parsing [sent. 3372 len. 91]: Writing to this brother he says -- '' I could not repeat the words exactly to Old Rogers , but I think it better to copy them exactly , in writing this account of our talk : `` At horsemanship , when you exercise it , read Crison Claudio , and a book that is called La Gloria del Cavallo , withal that you may join the thorough contemplation of it with the exercise ; and so shall you profit more in a month than others in a year . ''
Parsing [sent. 3373 len. 11]: `` I think I see what you mean , sir .
Parsing [sent. 3374 len. 42]: I had got to learn it all without book , as it were , though you know I had my old Bible , that my mother gave me , and without that I should not have learned it at all . ''
Parsing [sent. 3375 len. 10]: `` I only mean it comparatively , you know .
Parsing [sent. 3376 len. 15]: You have had more of the practice , and I more of the theory .
Parsing [sent. 3377 len. 21]: But if we had not both had both , we should neither of us have known anything about the matter .
Parsing [sent. 3378 len. 53]: I never was content without trying at least to understand things ; and if they are practical things , and you try to practise them at the same time as far as you do understand them , there is no end to the way in which the one lights up the other .
Parsing [sent. 3379 len. 23]: I suppose that is how , without your experience , I have more to say about such things than you could expect .
Parsing [sent. 3380 len. 34]: You know besides that a small matter in which a principle is involved will reveal the principle , if attended to , just as well as a great one containing the same principle .
Parsing [sent. 3381 len. 64]: The only difference , and that a most important one , is that , though I 've got my clay and my straw together , and they stick pretty well as yet , my brick , after all , is not half so well baked as yours , old friend , and it may crumble away yet , though I hope not . ''
Parsing [sent. 3382 len. 18]: `` I pray God to make both our bricks into stones of the New Jerusalem , sir .
Parsing [sent. 3383 len. 8]: I think I understand you quite well .
Parsing [sent. 3384 len. 15]: To know about a thing is of no use , except you do it .
Parsing [sent. 3385 len. 37]: Besides , as I found out when I went to sea , you never can know a thing till you do do it , though I thought I had a tidy fancy about some things beforehand .
Parsing [sent. 3386 len. 32]: It 's better not to be quite sure that all your seams are caulked , and so to keep a look-out on the bilge-pump ; is n't it , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3387 len. 18]: During the most of this conversation , we were standing by the mill-water , half frozen over .
Parsing [sent. 3388 len. 41]: The ice from both sides came towards the middle , leaving an empty space between , along which the dark water showed itself , hurrying away as if in fear of its life from the white death of the frost .
Parsing [sent. 3389 len. 65]: The wheel stood motionless , and the drip from the thatch of the mill over it in the sun , had frozen in the shadow into icicles , which hung in long spikes from the spokes and the floats , making the wheel -- soft green and mossy when it revolved in the gentle sun-mingled summer-water -- look like its own gray skeleton now .
Parsing [sent. 3390 len. 54]: The sun was getting low , and I should want all my time to see my other friends before dinner , for I would not willingly offend Mrs Pearson on Christmas Day by being late , especially as I guessed she was using extraordinary skill to prepare me a more than comfortable meal .
Parsing [sent. 3391 len. 27]: `` I must go , Old Rogers , '' I said ; `` but I will leave you something to think about till we meet again .
Parsing [sent. 3392 len. 38]: Find out why our Lord was so much displeased with the disciples , whom He knew to be ignorant men , for not knowing what He meant when He warned them against the leaven of the Pharisees .
Parsing [sent. 3393 len. 10]: I want to know what you think about it .
Parsing [sent. 3394 len. 22]: You 'll find the story told both in the sixteenth chapter of St Matthew and the eighth of St Mark . ''
Parsing [sent. 3395 len. 37]: `` Well , sir , I 'll try ; that is , if you will tell me what you think about it afterwards , so as to put me right , if I 'm wrong . ''
Parsing [sent. 3396 len. 17]: `` Of course I will , if I can find out an explanation to satisfy me .
Parsing [sent. 3397 len. 11]: But it is not at all clear to me now .
Parsing [sent. 3398 len. 23]: In fact , I do not see the connecting links of our Lord 's logic in the rebuke He gives them . ''
Parsing [sent. 3399 len. 19]: `` How am I to find out then , sir -- knowing nothing of logic at all ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3400 len. 16]: said the old man , his rough worn face summered over with his child-like smile .
Parsing [sent. 3401 len. 52]: `` There are many things which a little learning , while it can not really hide them , may make you less ready to see all at once , '' I answered , shaking hands with Old Rogers , and then springing across the brook with my carpet-bag in my hand .
Parsing [sent. 3402 len. 36]: By the time I had got through the rest of my calls , the fogs were rising from the streams and the meadows to close in upon my first Christmas Day in my own parish .
Parsing [sent. 3403 len. 15]: How much happier I was than when I came such a few months before !
Parsing [sent. 3404 len. 21]: The only pang I felt that day was as I passed the monsters on the gate leading to Oldcastle Hall .
Parsing [sent. 3405 len. 13]: Should I be honoured to help only the poor of the flock ?
Parsing [sent. 3406 len. 32]: Was I to do nothing for the rich , for whom it is , and has been , and doubtless will be so hard to enter into the kingdom of heaven ?
Parsing [sent. 3407 len. 37]: And it seemed to me at the moment that the world must be made for the poor : they had so much more done for them to enable them to inherit it than the rich had .
Parsing [sent. 3408 len. 14]: -- To these people at the Hall , I did not seem acceptable .
Parsing [sent. 3409 len. 32]: I might in time do something with Judy , but the old lady was still so dreadfully repulsive to me that it troubled my conscience to feel how I disliked her .
Parsing [sent. 3410 len. 37]: Mr Stoddart seemed nothing more than a dilettante in religion , as well as in the arts and sciences -- music always excepted ; while for Miss Oldcastle , I simply did not understand her yet .
Parsing [sent. 3411 len. 6]: And she was so beautiful !
Parsing [sent. 3412 len. 12]: I thought her more , beautiful every time I saw her .
Parsing [sent. 3413 len. 19]: But I never appeared to make the least progress towards any real acquaintance with her thoughts and feelings .
Parsing [sent. 3414 len. 69]: -- It seemed to me , I say , for a moment , coming from the houses of the warm-hearted poor , as if the rich had not quite fair play , as it were -- as if they were sent into the world chiefly for the sake of the cultivation of the virtues of the poor , and without much chance for the cultivation of their own .
Parsing [sent. 3415 len. 22]: I knew better than this you know , my reader ; but the thought came , as thoughts will come sometimes .
Parsing [sent. 3416 len. 24]: It vanished the moment I sought to lay hands upon it , as if it knew quite well it had no business there .
Parsing [sent. 3417 len. 32]: But certainly I did believe that it was more like the truth to say the world was made for the poor than to say that it was made for the rich .
Parsing [sent. 3418 len. 35]: And therefore I longed the more to do something for these whom I considered the rich of my flock ; for it was dreadful to think of their being poor inside instead of outside .
Parsing [sent. 3419 len. 29]: Perhaps my reader will say , and say with justice , that I ought to have been as anxious about poor Farmer Brownrigg as about the beautiful lady .
Parsing [sent. 3420 len. 25]: But the farmer liai given me good reason to hope some progress in him after the way he had given in about Jane Rogers .
Parsing [sent. 3421 len. 13]: Positively I had caught his eye during the sermon that very day .
Parsing [sent. 3422 len. 36]: And , besides -- but I will not be a hypocrite ; and seeing I did not certainly take the same interest in Mr Brownrigg , I will at least be honest and confess it .
Parsing [sent. 3423 len. 25]: As far as regards the discharge of my duties , I trust I should have behaved impartially had the necessity for any choice arisen .
Parsing [sent. 3424 len. 11]: But my feelings were not quite under my own control .
Parsing [sent. 3425 len. 24]: And we are nowhere , told to love everybody alike , only to love every one who comes within our reach as ourselves .
Parsing [sent. 3426 len. 11]: I wonder whether my old friend Dr Duncan was right .
Parsing [sent. 3427 len. 47]: He had served on shore in Egypt under General Abercrombie , and had of course , after the fighting was over on each of the several occasions -- the French being always repulsed -- exercised his office amongst the wounded left on the field of battle .
Parsing [sent. 3428 len. 35]: -- `` I do not know , '' he said , `` whether I did right or not ; but I always took the man I came to first -- French or English . ''
Parsing [sent. 3429 len. 20]: -- I only know that my heart did not wait for the opinion of my head on the matter .
Parsing [sent. 3430 len. 14]: I loved the old man the more that he did as he did .
Parsing [sent. 3431 len. 14]: But as a question of casuistry , I am doubtful about its answer .
Parsing [sent. 3432 len. 9]: This digression is , I fear , unpardonable .
Parsing [sent. 3433 len. 22]: I made Mrs Pearson sit down with me to dinner , for Christmas Day was not one to dine alone upon .
Parsing [sent. 3434 len. 16]: And I have ever since had my servants to dine with me on Christmas Day .
Parsing [sent. 3435 len. 37]: Then I went out again , and made another round of visits , coming in for a glass of wine at one table , an orange at another , and a hot chestnut at a third .
Parsing [sent. 3436 len. 22]: Those whom I could not see that day , I saw on the following days between it and the new year .
Parsing [sent. 3437 len. 10]: And so ended my Christmas holiday with my people .
Parsing [sent. 3438 len. 28]: But there is one little incident which I ought to relate before I close this chapter , and which I am ashamed of having so nearly forgotten .
Parsing [sent. 3439 len. 38]: When we had finished our dinner , and I was sitting alone drinking a class of claret before going out again , Mrs Pearson came in and told me that little Gerard Weir wanted to see me .
Parsing [sent. 3440 len. 30]: I asked her to show him in ; and the little fellow entered , looking very shy , and clinging first to the door and then to the wall .
Parsing [sent. 3441 len. 19]: `` Come , my dear boy , '' I said , `` and sit down by me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3442 len. 8]: He came directly and stood before me .
Parsing [sent. 3443 len. 11]: `` Would you like a little wine and water ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3444 len. 20]: I said ; for unhappily there was no dessert , Mrs Pearson knowing that I never eat such things .
Parsing [sent. 3445 len. 14]: `` No , thank you , sir ; I never tasted wine . ''
Parsing [sent. 3446 len. 10]: `` I did not press him to take it .
Parsing [sent. 3447 len. 46]: `` Please , sir , '' he went on after a pause , putting his nand in his pocket , `` mother gave me some goodies , and I kept them till I saw you come back , and here they are , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 3448 len. 12]: Does any reader doubt what I did or said upon this ?
Parsing [sent. 3449 len. 34]: I said , `` Thank you , my darling , '' and I ate them up every one of them , that he might see me eat them before he left the house .
Parsing [sent. 3450 len. 8]: And the dear child went off radiant .
Parsing [sent. 3451 len. 18]: If anybody can not understand why I did so , I beg him to consider the matter .
Parsing [sent. 3452 len. 25]: If then he can not come to a conclusion concerning it , I doubt if any explanation of mine would greatly subserve his enlightenment .
Parsing [sent. 3453 len. 81]: Meantime , I am forcibly restraining myself from yielding to the temptation to set forth my reasons , which would result in a half-hour 's sermon on the Jewish dispensation , including the burnt offering , and the wave and heave offerings , with an application to the ignorant nurses and mothers of English babies , who do the best they can to make original sin an actual fact by training children down in the way they should not go .
Parsing [sent. 3454 len. 3]: CHAPTER XII .
Parsing [sent. 3455 len. 3]: THE AVENUE .
Parsing [sent. 3456 len. 40]: It will not appear strange that I should linger so long upon the first few months of my association with a people who , now that I am an old man , look to me like my own children .
Parsing [sent. 3457 len. 35]: For those who were then older than myself are now `` old dwellers in those high countries '' where there is no age , only wisdom ; and I shall soon go to them .
Parsing [sent. 3458 len. 35]: How glad I shall be to see my Old Rogers again , who , as he taught me upon earth , will teach me yet niore , I thank my God , in heaven !
Parsing [sent. 3459 len. 35]: But I must not let the reverie which ' always gathers about the feather-end of my pen the moment I take it up to write these recollections , interfere with the work before me .
Parsing [sent. 3460 len. 14]: After this Christmas-tide , I found myself in closer relationship to my parishioners .
Parsing [sent. 3461 len. 31]: No doubt I was always in danger of giving unknown offence to those who were ready to fancy that I neglected them , and did not distribute my FAVOURS equally .
Parsing [sent. 3462 len. 17]: But as I never took offence , the offence I gave was easily got rid of .
Parsing [sent. 3463 len. 30]: A clergyman , of all men , should be slow to take offence , for if he does , he will never be free or strong to reprove sin .
Parsing [sent. 3464 len. 26]: And it must sometimes be his duty to speak severely to those , especially the good , who are turning their faces the wrong way .
Parsing [sent. 3465 len. 32]: It is of little use to reprove the sinner , but it is worth while sometimes to reprove those who have a regard for righteousness , however imperfect they may be .
Parsing [sent. 3466 len. 23]: `` Reprove not a scorner , lest he hate thee ; rebuke a wise man , and he will love thee . ''
Parsing [sent. 3467 len. 36]: But I took great care about INTERFERING ; though I would interfere upon request -- not always , however , upon the side whence the request came , and more seldom still upon either side .
Parsing [sent. 3468 len. 8]: The clergyman must never be a partisan .
Parsing [sent. 3469 len. 16]: When our Lord was requested to act as umpire between two brothers , He refused .
Parsing [sent. 3470 len. 16]: But He spoke and said , `` Take heed , and beware of covetousness . ''
Parsing [sent. 3471 len. 26]: Now , though the best of men is unworthy to loose the latchet of His shoe , yet the servant must be as his Master .
Parsing [sent. 3472 len. 3]: Ah me !
Parsing [sent. 3473 len. 22]: while I write it , I remember that the sinful woman might yet do as she would with His sacred feet .
Parsing [sent. 3474 len. 17]: I bethink me : Desert may not touch His shoe-tie : Love may kiss His feet .
Parsing [sent. 3475 len. 25]: I visited , of course , at the Hall , as at the farmhouses in the country , and the cottages in the village .
Parsing [sent. 3476 len. 10]: I did not come to like Mrs Oldcastle better .
Parsing [sent. 3477 len. 27]: And there was one woman in the house whom I disliked still more : that Sarah whom Judy had called in my hearing a white wolf .
Parsing [sent. 3478 len. 47]: Her face was yet whiter than that of her mistress , only it was not smooth like hers ; for its whiteness came apparently from the small-pox , which had so thickened the skin that no blood , if she had any , could shine through .
Parsing [sent. 3479 len. 24]: I seldom saw her -- only , indeed , caught a glimpse of her now and then as I passed through the house .
Parsing [sent. 3480 len. 10]: Nor did I make much progress with Mr Stoddart .
Parsing [sent. 3481 len. 40]: He had always something friendly to say , and often some theosophical theory to bring forward , which , I must add , never seemed to me to mean , or , at least , to reveal , anything .
Parsing [sent. 3482 len. 18]: He was a great reader of mystical books , and yet the man 's nature seemed cold .
Parsing [sent. 3483 len. 8]: It was sunshiny , but not sunny .
Parsing [sent. 3484 len. 12]: His intellect was rather a lambent flame than a genial warmth .
Parsing [sent. 3485 len. 12]: He could make things , but he could not grow anything .
Parsing [sent. 3486 len. 60]: And when I came to see that he had had more than any one else to do with the education of Miss Oldcastle , I understood her a little better , and saw that her so-called education had been in a great measure repression -- of a negative sort , no doubt , but not therefore the less mischievous .
Parsing [sent. 3487 len. 37]: For to teach speculation instead of devotion , mysticism instead of love , word instead of deed , is surely ruinously repressive to the nature that is meant for sunbright activity both of heart and hand .
Parsing [sent. 3488 len. 16]: My chief perplexity continued to be how he could play the organ as he did .
Parsing [sent. 3489 len. 25]: My reader will think that I am always coming round to Miss Oldcastle ; but if he does , I can not help it .
Parsing [sent. 3490 len. 13]: I began , I say , to understand her a little better .
Parsing [sent. 3491 len. 31]: She seemed to me always like one walking in a `` watery sunbeam , '' without knowing that it was but the wintry pledge of a summer sun at hand .
Parsing [sent. 3492 len. 39]: She took it , or was trying to take it , for THE sunlight ; trying to make herself feel all the glory people said was in the light , instead of making haste towards the perfect day .
Parsing [sent. 3493 len. 40]: I found afterwards that several things had combined to bring about this condition ; and I know she will forgive me , should I , for the sake of others , endeavour to make it understood by and by .
Parsing [sent. 3494 len. 13]: I have not much more to tell my readers about this winter .
Parsing [sent. 3495 len. 75]: As but of a whole changeful season only one day , or , it may be , but one moment in which the time seemed to burst into its own blossom , will cling to the memory ; so of the various interviews with my friends , and the whole flow of the current of my life , during that winter , nothing more of nature or human nature occurs to me worth recording .
Parsing [sent. 3496 len. 30]: I will pass on to the summer season as rapidly as I may , though the early spring will detain me with the relation of just a single incident .
Parsing [sent. 3497 len. 13]: I was on my way to the Hall to see Mr Stoddart .
Parsing [sent. 3498 len. 25]: I wanted to ask him whether something could not be done beyond his exquisite playing to rouse the sense of music in my people .
Parsing [sent. 3499 len. 57]: I believed that nothing helps you so much to feel as the taking of what share may , from the nature of the thing , be possible to you ; because , for one reason , in order to feel , it is necessary that the mind should rest upon the matter , whatever it is .
Parsing [sent. 3500 len. 25]: The poorest success , provided the attempt has been genuine , will enable one to enter into any art ten times better than before .
Parsing [sent. 3501 len. 62]: Now I had , I confess , little hope of moving Mr Stoddart in the matter ; but if I should succeed , I thought it would do himself more good to mingle with his humble fellows in the attempt to do them a trifle of good , than the opening of any number of intellectual windows towards the circumambient truth .
Parsing [sent. 3502 len. 8]: It was just beginning to grow dusk .
Parsing [sent. 3503 len. 67]: The wind was blustering in gusts among the trees , swaying them suddenly and fiercely like a keen passion , now sweeping them all one way as if the multitude of tops would break loose and rush away like a wild river , and now subsiding as suddenly , and allowing them to recover themselves and stand upright , with tones and motions of indignant expostulation .
Parsing [sent. 3504 len. 27]: There was just one cold bar of light in the west , and the east was one gray mass , while overhead the stars were twinkling .
Parsing [sent. 3505 len. 13]: The grass and all the ground about the trees were very wet .
Parsing [sent. 3506 len. 10]: The time seemed more dreary somehow than the winter .
Parsing [sent. 3507 len. 10]: Rigour was past , and tenderness had not come .
Parsing [sent. 3508 len. 47]: For the wind was cold without being keen , and bursting from the trees every now and then with a roar as of a sea breaking on distant sands , whirled about me as if it wanted me to go and join in its fierce play .
Parsing [sent. 3509 len. 34]: Suddenly I saw , to my amazement , in a walk that ran alongside of the avenue , Miss Oldcastle struggling against the wind , which blew straight down the path upon her .
Parsing [sent. 3510 len. 8]: The cause of my amazement was twofold .
Parsing [sent. 3511 len. 49]: First , I had supposed her with her mother in London , whither their journeys had been not infrequent since Christmas-tide ; and next -- why should she be fighting with the wind , so far from the house , with only a shawl drawn over her head ?
Parsing [sent. 3512 len. 28]: The reader may wonder how I should know her in this attire in the dusk , and where there was not the smallest probability of finding her .
Parsing [sent. 3513 len. 35]: Suffice it to say that I did recognise her at once ; and passing between two great tree-trunks , and through an opening in some under-wood , was by her side in a moment .
Parsing [sent. 3514 len. 46]: But the noise of the wind had prevented her from hearing my approach , and when I uttered her name , she started violently , and , turning , drew herself up very haughtily , in part , I presume , to hide her tremor .
Parsing [sent. 3515 len. 14]: -- She was always a little haughty with me , I must acknowledge .
Parsing [sent. 3516 len. 27]: Could there have been anything in my address , however unconscious of it I was , that made her fear I was ready to become intrusive ?
Parsing [sent. 3517 len. 47]: Or might it not be that , hearing of my footing with my parishioners generally , she was prepared to resent any assumption of clerical familiarity with her ; and so , in my behaviour , any poor innocent `` bush was supposed a bear . ''
Parsing [sent. 3518 len. 32]: For I need not tell my reader that nothing was farther from my intention , even with the lowliest of my flock , than to presume upon my position as clergyman .
Parsing [sent. 3519 len. 14]: I think they all GAVE me the relation I occupied towards them personally .
Parsing [sent. 3520 len. 13]: -- But I had never seen her look so haughty as now .
Parsing [sent. 3521 len. 16]: If I had been watching her very thoughts she could hardly have looked more indignant .
Parsing [sent. 3522 len. 20]: `` I beg your pardon , '' I said , distressed ; `` I have startled you dreadfully . ''
Parsing [sent. 3523 len. 30]: `` Not in the least , '' she replied , but without moving , and still with a curve in her form like the neck of a frayed horse .
Parsing [sent. 3524 len. 21]: I thought it better to leave apology , which was evidently disagreeable to her , and speak of indifferent things .
Parsing [sent. 3525 len. 16]: `` I was on my way to call on Mr Stoddart , '' I said .
Parsing [sent. 3526 len. 12]: `` You will find him at home , I believe . ''
Parsing [sent. 3527 len. 11]: `` I fancied you and Mrs Oldcastle in London . ''
Parsing [sent. 3528 len. 6]: `` We returned yesterday . ''
Parsing [sent. 3529 len. 6]: Still she stood as before .
Parsing [sent. 3530 len. 11]: I made a movement in the direction of the house .
Parsing [sent. 3531 len. 12]: She seemed as if she would walk in the opposite direction .
Parsing [sent. 3532 len. 12]: `` May I not walk with you to the house ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3533 len. 10]: `` I am not going in just yet . ''
Parsing [sent. 3534 len. 11]: `` Are you protected enough for sucn a night ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3535 len. 7]: `` I enjoy the wind . ''
Parsing [sent. 3536 len. 13]: I bowed and walked on ; for what else could I do ?
Parsing [sent. 3537 len. 35]: I can not say that I enjoyed leaving her behind me in the gathering dark , the wind blowing her about with no more reverence than if she had been a bush of privet .
Parsing [sent. 3538 len. 22]: Nor was it with a light heart that I bore her repulse as I slowly climbed the hill to the house .
Parsing [sent. 3539 len. 24]: However , a little personal mortification is wholesome -- though I can not say either that I derived much consolation from the reflection .
Parsing [sent. 3540 len. 24]: Sarah opened the glass door , her black , glossy , restless eyes looking out of her white face from under gray eyebrows .
Parsing [sent. 3541 len. 22]: I knew at once by her look beyond me that she had expected to find me accompanied by her young mistress .
Parsing [sent. 3542 len. 13]: I did not volunteer any information , as my reader may suppose .
Parsing [sent. 3543 len. 63]: I found , as I had feared , that , although Mr. Stoddart seemed to listen with some interest to what I said , I could not bring him to the point of making any practical suggestion , or of responding to one made by me ; and I left him with the conviction that he would do nothing to help me .
Parsing [sent. 3544 len. 17]: Yet during the whole of our interview he had not opposed a single word I said .
Parsing [sent. 3545 len. 20]: He was like clay too much softened with water to keep the form into which it has been modelled .
Parsing [sent. 3546 len. 16]: He would take SOME kind of form easily , and lose it yet more easily .
Parsing [sent. 3547 len. 64]: I did not show all my dissatisfaction , however , for that would only have estranged us ; and it is not required , nay , it may be wrong , to show all you feel or think : what is required of us is , not to show what we do not feel or think ; for that is to be false .
Parsing [sent. 3548 len. 9]: I left the house in a gloomy mood .
Parsing [sent. 3549 len. 25]: I know I ought to have looked up to God and said : `` These things do not reach to Thee , my Father .
Parsing [sent. 3550 len. 35]: Thou art ever the same ; and I rise above my small as well as my great troubles by remembering Thy peace , and Thy unchangeable Godhood to me and all Thy creatures . ''
Parsing [sent. 3551 len. 11]: But I did not come to myself all at once .
Parsing [sent. 3552 len. 20]: The thought of God had not come , though it was pretty sure to come before I got home .
Parsing [sent. 3553 len. 93]: I was brooding over the littleness of all I could do ; and feeling that sickness which sometimes will overtake a man in the midst of the work he likes best , when the unpleasant parts of it crowd upon him , and his own efforts , especially those made from the will without sustaining impulse , come back upon him with a feeling of unreality , decay , and bitterness , as if he had been unnatural and untrue , and putting himself in false relations by false efforts for good .
Parsing [sent. 3554 len. 19]: I know this all came from selfishness -- thinking about myself instead of about God and my neighbour .
Parsing [sent. 3555 len. 5]: But so it was .
Parsing [sent. 3556 len. 58]: -- And so I was walking down the avenue , where it was now very dark , with my head bent to the ground , when I in my turn started at the sound of a woman 's voice , and looking up , saw by the starlight the dim form of Miss Oldcastle standing before me .
Parsing [sent. 3557 len. 4]: She spoke first .
Parsing [sent. 3558 len. 11]: `` Mr Walton , I was very rude to you .
Parsing [sent. 3559 len. 6]: I beg your pardon . ''
Parsing [sent. 3560 len. 9]: `` Indeed , I did not think so .
Parsing [sent. 3561 len. 17]: I only thought what a blundering awkward fellow I was to startle you as I did .
Parsing [sent. 3562 len. 7]: You have to forgive me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3563 len. 47]: `` I fancy '' -- and here I know she smiled , though how I know I do not know -- `` I fancy I have made that even , '' she said , pleasantly ; `` for you must confess I startled you now . ''
Parsing [sent. 3564 len. 13]: `` You did ; but it was in a very different way .
Parsing [sent. 3565 len. 7]: I annoyed you with my rudeness .
Parsing [sent. 3566 len. 18]: You only scattered a swarm of bats that kept flapping their skinny wings in my face . ''
Parsing [sent. 3567 len. 6]: `` What do you mean ?
Parsing [sent. 3568 len. 12]: There are no bats at this time of the year . ''
Parsing [sent. 3569 len. 4]: `` Not outside .
Parsing [sent. 3570 len. 15]: In ` winter and rough weather ' they creep inside , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 3571 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 3572 len. 6]: I ought to understand you .
Parsing [sent. 3573 len. 11]: But I did not think you were ever like that .
Parsing [sent. 3574 len. 8]: I thought you were too good . ''
Parsing [sent. 3575 len. 6]: `` I wish I were .
Parsing [sent. 3576 len. 7]: I hope to be some day .
Parsing [sent. 3577 len. 7]: I am not yet , anyhow .
Parsing [sent. 3578 len. 14]: And I thank you for driving the bats away in the meantime . ''
Parsing [sent. 3579 len. 22]: `` You make me the more ashamed of myself to think that perhaps my rudeness had a share in bringing them .
Parsing [sent. 3580 len. 10]: -- Yours is no doubt thankless labour sometimes . ''
Parsing [sent. 3581 len. 20]: She seemed to make the last remark just to prevent the conversation from returning to her as its subject .
Parsing [sent. 3582 len. 14]: And now all the bright portions of my work came up before me .
Parsing [sent. 3583 len. 11]: `` You are quite mistaken in that , Miss Oldcastle .
Parsing [sent. 3584 len. 17]: On the contrary , the thanks I get are far more than commensurate with the labour .
Parsing [sent. 3585 len. 22]: Of course one meets with a disappointment sometimes , but that is only when they do n't know what you mean .
Parsing [sent. 3586 len. 14]: And how should they know what you mean till they are different themselves ?
Parsing [sent. 3587 len. 18]: -- You remember what Wordsworth says on this very subject in his poem of Simon Lee ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3588 len. 12]: -- `` I do not know anything of Wordsworth . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 3589 len. 17]: ` I 've heard of hearts unkind , kind deeds With coldness still returning ; Alas !
Parsing [sent. 3590 len. 12]: the gratitude of men Hath oftener left me mourning . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 3591 len. 11]: `` I do not quite see what he means . ''
Parsing [sent. 3592 len. 10]: `` May I recommend you to think about it ?
Parsing [sent. 3593 len. 29]: You will be sure to find it out for yourself , and that will be ten times more satisfactory than if I were to explain it to you .
Parsing [sent. 3594 len. 15]: And , besides , you will never forget it , if you do . ''
Parsing [sent. 3595 len. 9]: `` Will you repeat the lines again ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3596 len. 4]: I did so .
Parsing [sent. 3597 len. 9]: All this time the wind had been still .
Parsing [sent. 3598 len. 11]: Now it rose with a slow gush in the trees .
Parsing [sent. 3599 len. 4]: Was it fancy ?
Parsing [sent. 3600 len. 16]: Or , as the wind moved the shrubbery , did I see a white face ?
Parsing [sent. 3601 len. 13]: And could it be the White Wolf , as Judy called her ?
Parsing [sent. 3602 len. 19]: I spoke aloud : `` But it is cruel to keep you standing here in such a night .
Parsing [sent. 3603 len. 16]: You must be a real lover of nature to walk in the dark wind . ''
Parsing [sent. 3604 len. 5]: `` I like it .
Parsing [sent. 3605 len. 4]: Good night . ''
Parsing [sent. 3606 len. 4]: So we parted .
Parsing [sent. 3607 len. 53]: I gazed into the darkness after her , though she disappeared at the distance of a yard or two ; and would have stood longer had I not still suspected the proximity of Judy 's Wolf , which made me turn and go home , regardless now of Mr Stoddart 's DOUGHINESS .
Parsing [sent. 3608 len. 55]: I met Miss Oldcastle several times before the summer , but her old manner remained , or rather had returned , for there had been nothing of it in the tone of her voice in that interview , if INTERVIEW it could be called where neither could see more than the other 's outline .
Parsing [sent. 3609 len. 3]: CHAPTER XIII .
Parsing [sent. 3610 len. 3]: YOUNG WEIR .
Parsing [sent. 3611 len. 7]: By slow degrees the summer bloomed .
Parsing [sent. 3612 len. 11]: Green came instead of white ; rainbows instead of icicles .
Parsing [sent. 3613 len. 21]: The grounds about the Hall seemed the incarnation of a summer which had taken years to ripen to its perfection .
Parsing [sent. 3614 len. 35]: The very grass seemed to have aged into perfect youth in that `` haunt of ancient peace ; '' for surely nowhere else was such thick , delicate-bladed , delicate-coloured grass to be seen .
Parsing [sent. 3615 len. 60]: Gnarled old trees of may stood like altars of smoking perfume , or each like one million-petalled flower of upheaved whiteness -- or of tender rosiness , as if the snow which had covered it in winter had sunk in and gathered warmth from the life of the tree , and now crept out again to adorn the summer .
Parsing [sent. 3616 len. 31]: The long loops of the laburnum hung heavy with gold towards the sod below ; and the air was full of the fragrance of the young leaves of the limes .
Parsing [sent. 3617 len. 60]: Down in the valley below , the daisies shone in all the meadows , varied with the buttercup and the celandine ; while in damp places grew large pimpernels , and along the sides of the river , the meadow-sweet stood amongst the reeds at the very edge of the water , breathing out the odours of dreamful sleep .
Parsing [sent. 3618 len. 11]: The clumsy pollards were each one mass of undivided green .
Parsing [sent. 3619 len. 48]: The mill wheel had regained its knotty look , with its moss and its dip and drip , as it yielded to the slow water , which would have let it alone , but that there was no other way out of the land to the sea .
Parsing [sent. 3620 len. 40]: I used now to wander about in the fields and woods , with a book in my hand , at which I often did not look the whole day , and which yet I liked to have with me .
Parsing [sent. 3621 len. 19]: And I seemed somehow to come back with most upon those days in which I did not read .
Parsing [sent. 3622 len. 12]: In this manner I prepared almost all my sermons that summer .
Parsing [sent. 3623 len. 30]: But , although I prepared them thus in the open country , I had another custom , which perhaps may appear strange to some , before I preached them .
Parsing [sent. 3624 len. 19]: This was , to spend the Saturday evening , not in my study , but in the church .
Parsing [sent. 3625 len. 40]: This custom of mine was known to the sexton and his wife , and the church was always clean and ready for me after about mid-day , so that I could be alone there as soon as I pleased .
Parsing [sent. 3626 len. 20]: It would take more space than my limits will afford to explain thoroughly why I liked to do this .
Parsing [sent. 3627 len. 14]: But I will venture to attempt a partial explanation in a few words .
Parsing [sent. 3628 len. 29]: This fine old church in which I was honoured to lead the prayers of my people , was not the expression of the religious feeling of my time .
Parsing [sent. 3629 len. 35]: There was a gloom about it -- a sacred gloom , I know , and I loved it ; but such gloom as was not in my feeling when I talked to my flock .
Parsing [sent. 3630 len. 73]: I honoured the place ; I rejoiced in its history ; I delighted to think that even by the temples made with hands outlasting these bodies of ours , we were in a sense united to those who in them had before us lifted up holy hands without wrath or doubting ; and with many more who , like us , had lifted up at least prayerful hands without hatred or despair .
Parsing [sent. 3631 len. 24]: The place soothed me , tuned me to a solemn mood -- one of self-denial , and gentle gladness in all sober things .
Parsing [sent. 3632 len. 43]: But , had I been an architect , and had I had to build a church -- I do not in the least know how I should have built it -- I am certain it would have been very different from this .
Parsing [sent. 3633 len. 21]: Else I should be a mere imitator , like all the church-architects I know anything about in the present day .
Parsing [sent. 3634 len. 22]: For I always found the open air the most genial influence upon me for the production of religious feeling and thought .
Parsing [sent. 3635 len. 53]: I had been led to try whether it might not be so with me by the fact that our Lord seemed so much to delight in the open air , and late in the day as well as early in the morning would climb the mountain to be alone with His Father .
Parsing [sent. 3636 len. 95]: I found that it helped to give a reality to everything that I thought about , if I only contemplated it under the high untroubled blue , with the lowly green beneath my feet , and the wind blowing on me to remind me of the Spirit that once moved on the face of the waters , bringing order out of disorder and light out of darkness , and was now seeking every day a fuller entrance into my heart , that there He might work the one will of the Father in heaven .
Parsing [sent. 3637 len. 67]: My reader will see then that there was , as it were , not so much a discord , as a lack of harmony between the surroundings wherein my thoughts took form , or , to use a homelier phrase , my sermon was studied , and the surroundings wherein I had to put these forms into the garments of words , or preach that sermon .
Parsing [sent. 3638 len. 172]: I therefore sought to bridge over this difference -LRB- if I understood music , I am sure I could find an expression exactly fitted to my meaning -RRB- , -- to find an easy passage between the open-air mood and the church mood , so as to be able to bring into the church as much of the fresh air , and the tree-music , and the colour-harmony , and the gladness over all , as might be possible ; and , in order to this , I thought all my sermon over again in the afternoon sun as it shone slantingly through the stained window over Lord Eagleye 's tomb , and in the failing light thereafter and the gathering dusk of the twilight , pacing up and down the solemn old place , hanging my thoughts here on a crocket , there on a corbel ; now on the gable-point over which Weir 's face would gaze next morning , and now on the aspiring peaks of the organ .
Parsing [sent. 3639 len. 12]: I thus made the place a cell of thought and prayer .
Parsing [sent. 3640 len. 61]: And when the next day came , I found the forms around me so interwoven with the forms of my thought , that I felt almost like one of the old monks who had built the place , so little did I find any check to my thought or utterance from its unfitness for the expression of my individual modernism .
Parsing [sent. 3641 len. 62]: But not one atom the more did I incline to the evil fancy that God was more in the past than in the present ; that He is more within the walls of the church , than in the unwalled sky and earth ; or seek to turn backwards one step from a living Now to an entombed and consecrated Past .
Parsing [sent. 3642 len. 12]: One lovely Saturday , I had been out all the morning .
Parsing [sent. 3643 len. 37]: I had not walked far , for I had sat in the various places longer than I had walked , my path lying through fields and copses , crossing a country road only now and then .
Parsing [sent. 3644 len. 21]: I had my Greek Testament with me , and I read when I sat , and thought when I walked .
Parsing [sent. 3645 len. 114]: I remember well enough that I was going to preach about the cloud of witnesses , and explain to my people that this did not mean persons looking at , witnessing our behaviour -- not so could any addition be made to the awfulness of the fact that the eye of God was upon us -- but witnesses to the truth , people who did what God wanted them to do , come of it what might , whether a crown or a rack , scoffs or applause ; to behold whose witnessing might well rouse all that was human and divine in us to chose our part with them and their Lord .
Parsing [sent. 3646 len. 22]: -- When I came home , I had an early dinner , and then betook myself to my Saturday 's resort .
Parsing [sent. 3647 len. 14]: -- I had never had a room large enough to satisfy me before .
Parsing [sent. 3648 len. 8]: Now my study was to my mind .
Parsing [sent. 3649 len. 31]: All through the slowly-fading afternoon , the autumn of the day , when the colours are richest and the shadows long and lengthening , I paced my solemn old-thoughted church .
Parsing [sent. 3650 len. 65]: Sometimes I went up into the pulpit and sat there , looking on the ancient walls which had grown up under men 's hands that men might be helped to pray by the visible symbol of unity which the walls gave , and that the voice of the Spirit of God might be heard exhorting men to forsake the evil and choose the good .
Parsing [sent. 3651 len. 16]: And I thought how many witnesses to the truth had knelt in those ancient pews .
Parsing [sent. 3652 len. 28]: For as the great church is made up of numberless communities , so is the great shining orb of witness-bearers made up of millions of lesser orbs .
Parsing [sent. 3653 len. 28]: All men and women of true heart bear individual testimony to the truth of God , saying , `` I have trusted and found Him faithful . ''
Parsing [sent. 3654 len. 24]: And the feeble light of the glowworm is yet light , pure , and good , and with a loveliness of its own .
Parsing [sent. 3655 len. 19]: `` So , O Lord , '' I said , `` let my light shine before men . ''
Parsing [sent. 3656 len. 38]: And I felt no fear of vanity in such a prayer , for I knew that the glory to come of it is to God only -- `` that men may glorify their Father in heaven . ''
Parsing [sent. 3657 len. 29]: And I knew that when we seek glory for ourselves , the light goes out , and the Horror that dwells in darkness breathes cold upon our spirits .
Parsing [sent. 3658 len. 80]: And I remember that just as I thought thus , my eye was caught first by a yellow light that gilded the apex of the font-cover , which had been wrought like a flame or a bursting blossom : it was so old and worn , I never could tell which ; and then by a red light all over a white marble tablet in the wall -- the red of life on the cold hue of the grave .
Parsing [sent. 3659 len. 35]: And this red light did not come from any work of man 's device , but from the great window of the west , which little Gerard Weir wanted to help God to paint .
Parsing [sent. 3660 len. 45]: I must have been in a happy mood that Saturday afternoon , for everything pleased me and made me happier ; and all the church-forms about me blended and harmonised graciously with the throne and footstool of God which I saw through the windows .
Parsing [sent. 3661 len. 60]: And I lingered on till the night had come ; till the church only gloomed about me , and had no shine ; and then I found my spirit burning up the clearer , as a lamp which has been flaming all the day with light unseen becomes a glory in the room when the sun is gone down .
Parsing [sent. 3662 len. 11]: At length I felt tired , and would go home .
Parsing [sent. 3663 len. 29]: Yet I lingered for a few moments in the vestry , thinking what hymns would harmonize best with the things I wanted to make my people think about .
Parsing [sent. 3664 len. 19]: It was now almost quite dark out of doors -- at least as dark as it would be .
Parsing [sent. 3665 len. 14]: Suddenly through the gloom I thought I heard a moan and a sob .
Parsing [sent. 3666 len. 9]: I sat upright in my chair and listened .
Parsing [sent. 3667 len. 13]: But I heard nothing more , and concluded I had deceived myself .
Parsing [sent. 3668 len. 72]: After a few moments , I rose to go home and have some tea , and turn my mind rather away from than towards the subject of witness-bearing any more for that night , lest I should burn the fuel of it out before I came to warm the people with it , and should have to blow its embers instead of flashing its light and heat upon them in gladness .
Parsing [sent. 3669 len. 29]: So I left the church by my vestry-door , which I closed behind me , and took my way along the path through the clustering group of graves .
Parsing [sent. 3670 len. 6]: Again I heard a sob .
Parsing [sent. 3671 len. 8]: This time I was sure of it .
Parsing [sent. 3672 len. 12]: And there lay something dark upon one of the grassy mounds .
Parsing [sent. 3673 len. 10]: I approached it , but it did not move .
Parsing [sent. 3674 len. 3]: I spoke .
Parsing [sent. 3675 len. 11]: `` Can I be of any use to you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3676 len. 3]: I said .
Parsing [sent. 3677 len. 10]: `` No , '' returned an almost inaudible voice .
Parsing [sent. 3678 len. 47]: Though I did not know whose was the grave , I knew that no one had been buried there very lately , and if the grief were for the loss of the dead , it was more than probably aroused to fresh vigour by recent misfortune .
Parsing [sent. 3679 len. 30]: I stooped , and taking the figure by the arm , said , `` Come with me , and let us see what can be done for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3680 len. 16]: I then saw that it was a youth -- perhaps scarcely more than a boy .
Parsing [sent. 3681 len. 18]: And as soon as I saw that , I knew that his grief could hardly be incurable .
Parsing [sent. 3682 len. 20]: He returned no answer , but rose at once to his feet , and submitted to be led away .
Parsing [sent. 3683 len. 49]: I took him the shortest road to my house through the shrubbery , brought him into the study , made him sit down in my easy-chair , and rang for lights and wine ; for the dew had been falling heavily , and his clothes were quite dank .
Parsing [sent. 3684 len. 12]: But when the wine came , he refused to take any .
Parsing [sent. 3685 len. 10]: `` But you want it , '' I said .
Parsing [sent. 3686 len. 12]: `` No , sir , I do n't , indeed . ''
Parsing [sent. 3687 len. 10]: `` Take some for my sake , then . ''
Parsing [sent. 3688 len. 9]: `` I would rather not , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 3689 len. 4]: `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3690 len. 23]: `` I promised my father a year ago , when I left home that I would not drink anything stronger than water .
Parsing [sent. 3691 len. 13]: -LSB- sic -RSB- And I ca n't break my promise now . ''
Parsing [sent. 3692 len. 7]: `` Where is your home ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3693 len. 8]: `` In the village , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 3694 len. 17]: `` That was n't your father 's grave I found you upon , was it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3695 len. 5]: `` No , sir .
Parsing [sent. 3696 len. 7]: It was my mother 's . ''
Parsing [sent. 3697 len. 9]: `` Then your father is still alive ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3698 len. 5]: `` Yes , sir .
Parsing [sent. 3699 len. 10]: You know him very well -- Thomas Weir . ''
Parsing [sent. 3700 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 3701 len. 10]: He told me he had a son in London .
Parsing [sent. 3702 len. 6]: Are you that son ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3703 len. 15]: `` Yes , sir , '' answered the youth , swallowing a rising sob .
Parsing [sent. 3704 len. 7]: `` Then what is the matter ?
Parsing [sent. 3705 len. 19]: Your father is a good friend of mine , and would tell you you might trust me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3706 len. 9]: `` I do n't doubt it , sir .
Parsing [sent. 3707 len. 13]: But you wo n't believe me any more than my father . ''
Parsing [sent. 3708 len. 16]: By this time I had perused his person , his dress , and his countenance .
Parsing [sent. 3709 len. 12]: He was of middle size , but evidently not full grown .
Parsing [sent. 3710 len. 6]: His dress was very decent .
Parsing [sent. 3711 len. 15]: His face was pale and thin , and revealed a likeness to his father .
Parsing [sent. 3712 len. 35]: He had blue eyes that looked full at me , and , as far as I could judge , betokened , along with the whole of his expression , an honest and sensitive nature .
Parsing [sent. 3713 len. 21]: I found him very attractive , and was therefore the more emboldened to press for the knowledge of his story .
Parsing [sent. 3714 len. 16]: `` I can not promise to believe whatever you say ; but almost I could .
Parsing [sent. 3715 len. 36]: And if you tell me the truth , I like you too much already to be in great danger of doubting you , for you know the truth has a force of its own . ''
Parsing [sent. 3716 len. 11]: `` I thought so till to-night , '' he answered .
Parsing [sent. 3717 len. 22]: `` But if my father would not believe me , how can I expect you to do so , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3718 len. 20]: `` Your father may have been too much troubled by your story to be able to do it justice .
Parsing [sent. 3719 len. 13]: It is not a bit like your father to be unfair . ''
Parsing [sent. 3720 len. 5]: `` No , sir .
Parsing [sent. 3721 len. 12]: And so much the less chance of your believing me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3722 len. 11]: Somehow his talk prepossessed me still more in his favour .
Parsing [sent. 3723 len. 48]: There was a certain refinement in it , a quality of dialogue which indicated thought , as I judged ; and I became more and more certain that , whatever I might have to think of it when told , he would yet tell me the truth .
Parsing [sent. 3724 len. 10]: `` Come , try me , '' I said .
Parsing [sent. 3725 len. 6]: `` I will , sir .
Parsing [sent. 3726 len. 9]: But I must begin at the beginning . ''
Parsing [sent. 3727 len. 6]: `` Begin where you like .
Parsing [sent. 3728 len. 17]: I have nothing more to do to-night , and you may take what time you please .
Parsing [sent. 3729 len. 22]: But I will ring for tea first ; for I dare say you have not made any promise about that . ''
Parsing [sent. 3730 len. 8]: A faint smile flickered on his face .
Parsing [sent. 3731 len. 11]: He was evidently beginning to feel a little more comfortable .
Parsing [sent. 3732 len. 9]: `` When did you arrive from London ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3733 len. 3]: I asked .
Parsing [sent. 3734 len. 10]: `` About two hours ago , I suppose . ''
Parsing [sent. 3735 len. 19]: `` Bring tea , Mrs Pearson , and that cold chicken and ham , and plenty of toast .
Parsing [sent. 3736 len. 6]: We are both hungry . ''
Parsing [sent. 3737 len. 17]: Mrs Pearson gave a questioning look at the lad , and departed to do her duty .
Parsing [sent. 3738 len. 57]: When she returned with the tray , I saw by the unconsciously eager way in which he looked at the eatables , that he had had nothing for some time ; and so , even after we were left alone , I would not let him say a word till he had made a good meal .
Parsing [sent. 3739 len. 9]: It was delightful to see how he ate .
Parsing [sent. 3740 len. 30]: Few troubles will destroy a growing lad 's hunger ; and indeed it has always been to me a marvel how the feelings and the appetites affect each other .
Parsing [sent. 3741 len. 18]: I have known grief actually make people , and not sensual people at all , quite hungry .
Parsing [sent. 3742 len. 13]: At last I thought I had better not offer him any more .
Parsing [sent. 3743 len. 36]: After the tea-things had been taken away , I put the candles out ; and the moon , which had risen , nearly full , while we were at tea , shone into the room .
Parsing [sent. 3744 len. 80]: I had thought that he might possibly find it easier to tell his story in the moonlight , which , if there were any shame in the recital , would not , by too much revelation , reduce him to the despair of Macbeth , when , feeling that he could contemplate his deed , but not his deed and himself together , he exclaimed , `` To know my deed , ` twere best not know myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 3745 len. 15]: So , sitting by the window in the moonlight , he told his tale .
Parsing [sent. 3746 len. 29]: The moon lighted up his pale face as he told it , and gave rather a wild expression to his eyes , eager to find faith in me .
Parsing [sent. 3747 len. 27]: -- I have not much of the dramatic in me , I know ; and I am rather a flat teller of stories on that account .
Parsing [sent. 3748 len. 24]: I shall not , therefore , seeing there is no necessity for it , attempt to give the tale in his own words .
Parsing [sent. 3749 len. 62]: But , indeed , when I think of it , they did not differ so much from the form of my own , for he had , I presume , lost his provincialisms , and being , as I found afterwards , a reader of the best books that came in his way , had not caught up many cockneyisms instead .
Parsing [sent. 3750 len. 34]: He had filled a place in the employment of Messrs -- & Co. , large silk-mercers , linen-drapers , etc. , etc. , in London ; for all the trades are mingled now .
Parsing [sent. 3751 len. 47]: His work at first was to accompany one of the carts which delivered the purchases of the day ; but , I presume because he showed himself to be a smart lad , they took him at length into the shop to wait behind the counter .
Parsing [sent. 3752 len. 26]: This he did not like so much , but , as it was considered a rise in life , made no objection to the change .
Parsing [sent. 3753 len. 10]: He seemed to himself to get on pretty well .
Parsing [sent. 3754 len. 30]: He soon learned all the marks on the goods intended to be understood by the shopmen , and within a few months believed that he was found generally useful .
Parsing [sent. 3755 len. 30]: He had as yet had no distinct department allotted to him , but was moved from place to place , according as the local pressure of business might demand .
Parsing [sent. 3756 len. 23]: `` I confess , '' he said , `` that I was not always satisfied with what was going on about me .
Parsing [sent. 3757 len. 19]: I mean I could not help doubting if everything was done on the square , as they say .
Parsing [sent. 3758 len. 20]: But nothing came plainly in my way , and so I could honestly say it did not concern me .
Parsing [sent. 3759 len. 33]: I took care to be straightforward for my part , and , knowing only the prices marked for the sale of the goods , I had nothing to do with anything else .
Parsing [sent. 3760 len. 54]: But one day , while I was showing a lady some handkerchiefs which were marked as mouchoirs de Paris -- I do n't know if I pronounce it right , sir -- she said she did not believe they were French cambric ; and I , knowing nothing about it , said nothing .
Parsing [sent. 3761 len. 65]: But , happening to look up while we both stood silent , the lady examining the handkerchiefs , and I doing nothing till she should have made up her mind , I caught sight of the eyes of the shop-walker , as they call the man who shows customers where to go for what they want , and sees that they are attended to .
Parsing [sent. 3762 len. 27]: He is a fat man , dressed in black , with a great gold chain , which they say in the shop is only copper gilt .
Parsing [sent. 3763 len. 14]: But that does n't matter , only it would be the liker himself .
Parsing [sent. 3764 len. 7]: He was standing staring at me .
Parsing [sent. 3765 len. 32]: I could not tell what to make of it ; but from that day I often caught him watching me , as if I had been a customer suspected of shop-lifting .
Parsing [sent. 3766 len. 15]: Still I only thought he was very disagreeable , and tried to forget him .
Parsing [sent. 3767 len. 33]: `` One day -- the day before yesterday -- two ladies , an old lady and a young one , came into the shop , and wanted to look at some shawls .
Parsing [sent. 3768 len. 17]: It was dinner-time , and most of the men were in the house at their dinner .
Parsing [sent. 3769 len. 41]: The shop-walker sent me to them , and then , I do believe , though I did not see him , stood behind a pillar to watch me , as he had been in the way of doing more openly .
Parsing [sent. 3770 len. 34]: I thought I had seen the ladies before , and though I could not then tell where , I am now almost sure they were Mrs and Miss Oldcastle , of the Hall .
Parsing [sent. 3771 len. 11]: They wanted to buy a cashmere for the young lady .
Parsing [sent. 3772 len. 5]: I showed them some .
Parsing [sent. 3773 len. 4]: They wanted better .
Parsing [sent. 3774 len. 16]: I brought the best we had , inquiring , that I might make no mistake .
Parsing [sent. 3775 len. 5]: They asked the price .
Parsing [sent. 3776 len. 4]: I told them .
Parsing [sent. 3777 len. 15]: They said they were not good enough , and wanted to see some more .
Parsing [sent. 3778 len. 10]: I told them they were the best we had .
Parsing [sent. 3779 len. 27]: They looked at them again ; said they were sorry , but the shawls were not good enough , and left the shop without buying anything .
Parsing [sent. 3780 len. 33]: I proceeded to take the shawls up-stairs again , and , as I went , passed the shop walker , whom I had not observed while I was attending to the ladies .
Parsing [sent. 3781 len. 11]: ` YOU 're for no good , young man ! '
Parsing [sent. 3782 len. 7]: he said with a nasty sneer .
Parsing [sent. 3783 len. 12]: ` What do you mean by that , Mr B. ? '
Parsing [sent. 3784 len. 10]: I asked , for his sneer made me angry .
Parsing [sent. 3785 len. 15]: ` You 'll know before to-morrow , ' he answered , and walked away .
Parsing [sent. 3786 len. 21]: That same evening , as we were shutting up shop , I was sent for to the principal 's room .
Parsing [sent. 3787 len. 21]: The moment I entered , he said , ` You wo n't suit us , young man , I find .
Parsing [sent. 3788 len. 14]: You had better pack up your box to-night , and be off to-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 3789 len. 8]: There 's your quarter 's salary . '
Parsing [sent. 3790 len. 7]: ` What have I done ? '
Parsing [sent. 3791 len. 15]: I asked in astonishment , and yet with a vague suspicion of the matter .
Parsing [sent. 3792 len. 20]: ` It 's not what you 've done , but what you do n't do , ' he answered .
Parsing [sent. 3793 len. 25]: ` Do you think we can afford to keep you here and pay you wages to send people away from the shop without buying ?
Parsing [sent. 3794 len. 12]: If you do , you 're mistaken , that 's all .
Parsing [sent. 3795 len. 5]: You may go . '
Parsing [sent. 3796 len. 8]: ` But what could I do ? '
Parsing [sent. 3797 len. 4]: I said . '
Parsing [sent. 3798 len. 18]: I suppose that spy , B -- , ' -- I believe I said so , sir .
Parsing [sent. 3799 len. 14]: ` Now , now , young man , none of your sauce ! '
Parsing [sent. 3800 len. 4]: said Mr -- .
Parsing [sent. 3801 len. 11]: ` Honest people do n't think about spies . ' '
Parsing [sent. 3802 len. 17]: I thought it was for honesty you were getting rid of me , ' I said .
Parsing [sent. 3803 len. 17]: Mr -- rose to his feet , his lips white , and pointed to the door .
Parsing [sent. 3804 len. 8]: ` Take your money and be off .
Parsing [sent. 3805 len. 12]: And mind you do n't refer to me for a character .
Parsing [sent. 3806 len. 13]: After such impudence I could n't in conscience give you one . '
Parsing [sent. 3807 len. 32]: Then , calming down a little when he saw I turned to go , ` You had better take to your hands again , for your head will never keep you .
Parsing [sent. 3808 len. 6]: There , be off ! '
Parsing [sent. 3809 len. 16]: he said , pushing the money towards me , and turning his back to me .
Parsing [sent. 3810 len. 6]: I could not touch it .
Parsing [sent. 3811 len. 12]: ` Keep the money , Mr -- , ' I said .
Parsing [sent. 3812 len. 14]: ` It 'll make up for what you 've lost by me . '
Parsing [sent. 3813 len. 13]: And I left the room at once without waiting for an answer .
Parsing [sent. 3814 len. 23]: `` While I was packing my box , one of my chums came in , and I told him all about it .
Parsing [sent. 3815 len. 26]: He is rather a good fellow that , sir ; but he laughed , and said , ` What a fool you are , Weir !
Parsing [sent. 3816 len. 15]: YOU 'll never make your daily bread , and you need n't think it .
Parsing [sent. 3817 len. 13]: If you knew what I know , you 'd have known better .
Parsing [sent. 3818 len. 12]: And it 's very odd it was about shawls , too .
Parsing [sent. 3819 len. 5]: I 'll tell you .
Parsing [sent. 3820 len. 13]: As you 're going away , you wo n't let it out .
Parsing [sent. 3821 len. 36]: Mr -- ' -LRB- that was the same who had just turned me away -RRB- ` was serving some ladies himself , for he was n't above being in the shop , like his partner .
Parsing [sent. 3822 len. 10]: They wanted the best Indian shawl they could get .
Parsing [sent. 3823 len. 21]: None of those he showed them were good enough , for the ladies really did n't know one from another .
Parsing [sent. 3824 len. 17]: They always go by the price you ask , and Mr -- knew that well enough .
Parsing [sent. 3825 len. 27]: He had sent me up-stairs for the shawls , and as I brought them he said , `` These are the best imported , madam . ''
Parsing [sent. 3826 len. 24]: There were three ladies ; and one shook her head , and another shook her head , and they all shook their heads .
Parsing [sent. 3827 len. 20]: And then Mr -- was sorry , I believe you , that he had said they were the best .
Parsing [sent. 3828 len. 10]: But you wo n't catch him in a trap !
Parsing [sent. 3829 len. 10]: He 's too old a fox for that . '
Parsing [sent. 3830 len. 12]: I 'm telling you , sir , what Johnson told me .
Parsing [sent. 3831 len. 25]: ` He looked close down at the shawls , as if he were short-sighted , though he could see as far as any man .
Parsing [sent. 3832 len. 17]: `` I beg your pardon , ladies , '' said he , `` you 're right .
Parsing [sent. 3833 len. 5]: I am quite wrong .
Parsing [sent. 3834 len. 7]: What a stupid blunder to make !
Parsing [sent. 3835 len. 7]: And yet they did deceive me .
Parsing [sent. 3836 len. 9]: Here , Johnson , take these shawls away .
Parsing [sent. 3837 len. 7]: How could you be so stupid ?
Parsing [sent. 3838 len. 12]: I will fetch the thing you want myself , ladies . ''
Parsing [sent. 3839 len. 6]: So I went with him .
Parsing [sent. 3840 len. 39]: He chose out three or four shawls , of the nicest patterns , from the very same lot , marked in the very same way , folded them differently , and gave them to me to carry down .
Parsing [sent. 3841 len. 10]: `` Now , ladies , here they are ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3842 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 3843 len. 25]: `` These are quite a different thing , as you will see ; and , indeed , they cost half as much again . ''
Parsing [sent. 3844 len. 27]: In five minutes they had bought two of them , and paid just half as much more than he had asked for them the first time .
Parsing [sent. 3845 len. 5]: That 's Mr -- !
Parsing [sent. 3846 len. 18]: and that 's what you should have done if you had wanted to keep your place . '
Parsing [sent. 3847 len. 21]: -- But I assure you , sir , I could not help being glad to be out of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3848 len. 17]: `` But there is nothing in all this to be miserable about , '' I said .
Parsing [sent. 3849 len. 7]: `` You did your duty . ''
Parsing [sent. 3850 len. 14]: `` It would be all right , sir , if father believed me .
Parsing [sent. 3851 len. 13]: I do n't want to be idle , I 'm sure . ''
Parsing [sent. 3852 len. 9]: `` Does your father think you do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3853 len. 9]: `` I do n't know what he thinks .
Parsing [sent. 3854 len. 7]: He wo n't speak to me .
Parsing [sent. 3855 len. 26]: I told my story -- as much of it as he would let me , at least -- but he would n't listen to me .
Parsing [sent. 3856 len. 9]: He only said he knew better than that .
Parsing [sent. 3857 len. 6]: I could n't bear it .
Parsing [sent. 3858 len. 8]: He always was rather hard upon us .
Parsing [sent. 3859 len. 28]: I 'm sure if you had n't been so kind to me , sir , I do n't know what I should have done by this time .
Parsing [sent. 3860 len. 10]: I have n't another friend in the world . ''
Parsing [sent. 3861 len. 6]: `` Yes , you have .
Parsing [sent. 3862 len. 9]: Your Father in heaven is your friend . ''
Parsing [sent. 3863 len. 9]: `` I do n't know that , sir .
Parsing [sent. 3864 len. 7]: I 'm not good enough . ''
Parsing [sent. 3865 len. 6]: `` That 's quite true .
Parsing [sent. 3866 len. 17]: But you would never have done your duty if He had not been with you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3867 len. 9]: `` DO you think so , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3868 len. 5]: he returned , eagerly .
Parsing [sent. 3869 len. 6]: `` Indeed , I do .
Parsing [sent. 3870 len. 9]: Everything good comes from the Father of lights .
Parsing [sent. 3871 len. 16]: Every one that walks in any glimmering of light walks so far in HIS light .
Parsing [sent. 3872 len. 13]: For there is no light -- only darkness -- comes from below .
Parsing [sent. 3873 len. 10]: And man apart from God can generate no light .
Parsing [sent. 3874 len. 13]: He 's not meant to be separated from God , you see .
Parsing [sent. 3875 len. 21]: And only think then what light He can give you if you will turn to Him and ask for it .
Parsing [sent. 3876 len. 22]: What He has given you should make you long for more ; for what you have is not enough -- ah !
Parsing [sent. 3877 len. 5]: far from it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3878 len. 6]: `` I think I understand .
Parsing [sent. 3879 len. 12]: But I did n't feel good at all in the matter .
Parsing [sent. 3880 len. 11]: I did n't see any other way of doing . ''
Parsing [sent. 3881 len. 6]: `` So much the better .
Parsing [sent. 3882 len. 7]: We ought never to feel good .
Parsing [sent. 3883 len. 8]: We are but unprofitable servants at best .
Parsing [sent. 3884 len. 25]: There is no merit in doing your duty ; only you would have been a poor wretched creature not to do as you did .
Parsing [sent. 3885 len. 52]: And now , instead of making yourself miserable over the consequences of it , you ought to bear them like a man , with courage and hope , thanking God that He has made you suffer for righteousness ' sake , and denied you the success and the praise of cheating .
Parsing [sent. 3886 len. 19]: I will go to your father at once , and find out what he is thinking about it .
Parsing [sent. 3887 len. 16]: For no doubt Mr -- has written to him with his version of the story .
Parsing [sent. 3888 len. 18]: Perhaps he will be more inclined to believe you when he finds that I believe you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3889 len. 9]: `` Oh , thank you , sir ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3890 len. 15]: cried the lad , and jumped up from his seat to go with me .
Parsing [sent. 3891 len. 16]: `` No , '' I said ; `` you had better stay where you are .
Parsing [sent. 3892 len. 14]: I shall be able to speak more freely if you are not present .
Parsing [sent. 3893 len. 9]: Here is a book to amuse yourself with .
Parsing [sent. 3894 len. 11]: I do not think I shall be long gone . ''
Parsing [sent. 3895 len. 12]: But I was longer gone than I thought I should be .
Parsing [sent. 3896 len. 22]: When I reached the carpenter 's house , I found , to my surprise , that he was still at work .
Parsing [sent. 3897 len. 23]: By the light of a single tallow candle placed beside him on the bench , he was ploughing away at a groove .
Parsing [sent. 3898 len. 43]: His pale face , of which the lines were unusually sharp , as I might have expected after what had occurred , was the sole object that reflected the light of the candle to my eyes as I entered the gloomy place .
Parsing [sent. 3899 len. 21]: He looked up , but without even greeting me , dropped his face again and went on with his work .
Parsing [sent. 3900 len. 4]: `` What ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3901 len. 72]: I said , cheerily , -- for I believed that , like Gideon 's pitcher , I held dark within me the light that would discomfit his Midianites , which consciousness may well make the pitcher cheery inside , even while the light as yet is all its own -- worthless , till it break out upon the world , and cease to illuminate only glazed pitcher-sides -- `` What ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3902 len. 9]: I said , `` working so late ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3903 len. 6]: `` Yes , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 3904 len. 12]: `` It is not usual with you , I know . ''
Parsing [sent. 3905 len. 8]: `` It 's all a humbug ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3906 len. 53]: he said fiercely , but coldly notwithstanding , as he stood erect from his work , and turned his white face full on me -- of which , however , the eyes drooped -- `` It 's all a humbug ; and I do n't mean to be humbugged any more . ''
Parsing [sent. 3907 len. 7]: `` Am I a humbug ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3908 len. 9]: I returned , not quite taken by surprise .
Parsing [sent. 3909 len. 7]: `` I do n't say that .
Parsing [sent. 3910 len. 11]: Do n't make a personal thing of it , sir .
Parsing [sent. 3911 len. 14]: You 're taken in , I believe , like the rest of us .
Parsing [sent. 3912 len. 9]: Tell me that a God governs the world !
Parsing [sent. 3913 len. 12]: What have I done , to be used like this ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3914 len. 25]: I thought with myself how I could retort for his young son : `` What has he done to be used like this ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3915 len. 17]: But that was not my way , though it might work well enough in some hands .
Parsing [sent. 3916 len. 8]: Some men are called to be prophets .
Parsing [sent. 3917 len. 9]: I could only `` stand and wait . ''
Parsing [sent. 3918 len. 21]: `` It would be wrong in me to pretend ignorance , '' I said , `` of what you mean .
Parsing [sent. 3919 len. 7]: I know all about it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3920 len. 4]: `` Do you ?
Parsing [sent. 3921 len. 9]: He has been to you , has he ?
Parsing [sent. 3922 len. 11]: But you do n't know all about it , sir .
Parsing [sent. 3923 len. 8]: The impudence of the young rascal ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3924 len. 6]: He paused for a moment .
Parsing [sent. 3925 len. 7]: `` A man like me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3926 len. 64]: he resumed , becoming eloquent in his indignation , and , as I thought afterwards , entirely justifying what Wordsworth says about the language of the so-called uneducated , -- `` A man like me , who was as proud of his honour as any aristocrat in the country -- prouder than any of them would grant me the right to be ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3927 len. 19]: `` Too proud of it , I think -- not too careful of it , '' I said .
Parsing [sent. 3928 len. 19]: But I was thankful he did not heed me , for the speech would only have irritated him .
Parsing [sent. 3929 len. 4]: He went on .
Parsing [sent. 3930 len. 8]: `` Me to be treated like this !
Parsing [sent. 3931 len. 14]: One child a ... '' Here came a terrible break in his speech .
Parsing [sent. 3932 len. 5]: But he tried again .
Parsing [sent. 3933 len. 37]: `` And the other a ... '' Instead of finishing the sentence , however , he drove his plough fiercely through the groove , splitting off some inches of the wall of it at the end .
Parsing [sent. 3934 len. 24]: `` If any one has treated you so , '' I said , `` it must be the devil , not God . ''
Parsing [sent. 3935 len. 16]: `` But if there was a God , he could have prevented it all . ''
Parsing [sent. 3936 len. 16]: `` Mind what I said to you once before : He has n't done yet .
Parsing [sent. 3937 len. 19]: And there is another enemy in His way as bad as the devil -- I mean our SELVES .
Parsing [sent. 3938 len. 17]: When people want to walk their own way without God , God lets them try it .
Parsing [sent. 3939 len. 10]: And then the devil gets a hold of them .
Parsing [sent. 3940 len. 9]: But God wo n't let him keep them .
Parsing [sent. 3941 len. 24]: As soon as they are ` wearied in the greatness of their way , ' they begin to look about for a Saviour .
Parsing [sent. 3942 len. 86]: And then they find God ready to pardon , ready to help , not breaking the bruised reed -- leading them to his own self manifest -- with whom no man can fear any longer , Jesus Christ , the righteous lover of men -- their elder brother -- what we call BIG BROTHER , you know -- one to help them and take their part against the devil , the world , and the flesh , and all the rest of the wicked powers .
Parsing [sent. 3943 len. 57]: So you see God is tender -- just like the prodigal son 's father -- only with this difference , that God has millions of prodigals , and never gets tired of going out to meet them and welcome them back , every one as if he were the only prodigal son He had ever had .
Parsing [sent. 3944 len. 6]: There 's a father indeed !
Parsing [sent. 3945 len. 11]: Have you been such a father to your son ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3946 len. 12]: `` The prodigal did n't come with a pack of lies .
Parsing [sent. 3947 len. 13]: He told his father the truth , bad as it was . ''
Parsing [sent. 3948 len. 15]: `` How do you know that your son did n't tell you the truth ?
Parsing [sent. 3949 len. 16]: All the young men that go from home do n't do as the prodigal did .
Parsing [sent. 3950 len. 11]: Why should you not believe what he tells you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3951 len. 11]: `` I 'm not one to reckon without my host .
Parsing [sent. 3952 len. 6]: Here 's my bill . ''
Parsing [sent. 3953 len. 10]: And so saying , he handed me a letter .
Parsing [sent. 3954 len. 52]: I took it and read : -- `` SIR , -- It has become our painful duty to inform you that your son has this day been discharged from the employment of Messrs -- and Co. , his conduct not being such as to justify the confidence hitherto reposed in him .
Parsing [sent. 3955 len. 46]: It would have been contrary to the interests of the establishment to continue him longer behind the counter , although we are not prepared to urge anything against him beyond the fact that he has shown himself absolutely indifferent to the interests of his employers .
Parsing [sent. 3956 len. 53]: We trust that the chief blame will be found to lie with certain connexions of a kind easy to be formed in large cities , and that the loss of his situation may be punishment sufficient , if not for justice , yet to make him consider his ways and be wise .
Parsing [sent. 3957 len. 50]: We enclose his quarter 's salary , which the young man rejected with insult , and , `` We remain , & c. , '' -- and Co. '' `` And , '' I exclaimed , `` this is what you found your judgment of your own son upon !
Parsing [sent. 3958 len. 13]: You reject him unheard , and take the word of a stranger !
Parsing [sent. 3959 len. 19]: I do n't wonder you can not believe in your Father when you behave so to your son .
Parsing [sent. 3960 len. 16]: I do n't say your conclusion is false , though I do n't believe it .
Parsing [sent. 3961 len. 15]: But I do say the grounds you go upon are anything but sufficient . ''
Parsing [sent. 3962 len. 44]: `` You do n't mean to tell me that a man of Mr -- 's standing , who has one of the largest shops in London , and whose brother is Mayor of Addicehead , would slander a poor lad like that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3963 len. 6]: `` Oh you mammon-worshipper ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3964 len. 3]: I cried .
Parsing [sent. 3965 len. 31]: `` Because a man has one of the largest shops in London , and his brother is Mayor of Addicehead , you take his testimony and refuse your son 's !
Parsing [sent. 3966 len. 94]: I did not know the boy till this evening ; but I call upon you to bring back to your memory all that you have known of him from his childhood , and then ask yourself whether there is not , at least , as much probability of his having remained honest as of the master of a great London shop being infallible in his conclusions -- at which conclusions , whatever they be , I confess no man can wonder , after seeing how readily his father listens to his defamation . ''
Parsing [sent. 3967 len. 5]: I spoke with warmth .
Parsing [sent. 3968 len. 38]: Before I had done , the pale face of the carpenter was red as fire ; for he had been acting contrary to all his own theories of human equality , and that in a shameful manner .
Parsing [sent. 3969 len. 13]: Still , whether convinced or not , he would not give in .
Parsing [sent. 3970 len. 14]: He only drove away at his work , which he was utterly destroying .
Parsing [sent. 3971 len. 42]: His mouth was closed so tight , he looked as if he had his jaw locked ; and his eyes gleamed over the ruined board with a light which seemed to me to have more of obstinacy in it than contrition .
Parsing [sent. 3972 len. 6]: `` Ah , Thomas ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3973 len. 58]: I said , taking up the speech once more , `` if God had behaved to us as you have behaved to your boy -- be he innocent , be he guilty -- there 's not a man or woman of all our lost race would have returned to Him from the time of Adam till now .
Parsing [sent. 3974 len. 15]: I do n't wonder that you find it difficult to believe in Him . ''
Parsing [sent. 3975 len. 44]: And with those words I left the shop , determined to overwhelm the unbeliever with proof , and put him to shame before his own soul , whence , I thought , would come even more good to him than to his son .
Parsing [sent. 3976 len. 36]: For there was a great deal of self-satisfaction mixed up with the man 's honesty , and the sooner that had a blow the better -- it might prove a death-blow in the long run .
Parsing [sent. 3977 len. 12]: It was pride that lay at the root of his hardness .
Parsing [sent. 3978 len. 10]: He visited the daughter 's fault upon the son .
Parsing [sent. 3979 len. 40]: His daughter had disgraced him ; and he was ready to flash into wrath with his son upon any imputation which recalled to him the torture he had undergone when his daughter 's dishonour came first to the light .
Parsing [sent. 3980 len. 21]: Her he had never forgiven , and now his pride flung his son out after her upon the first suspicion .
Parsing [sent. 3981 len. 16]: His imagination had filled up all the blanks in the wicked insinuations of Mr -- .
Parsing [sent. 3982 len. 22]: He concluded that he had taken money to spend in the worst company , and had so disgraced him beyond forgiveness .
Parsing [sent. 3983 len. 6]: His pride paralysed his love .
Parsing [sent. 3984 len. 10]: He thought more about himself than about his children .
Parsing [sent. 3985 len. 13]: His own shame outweighed in his estimation the sadness of their guilt .
Parsing [sent. 3986 len. 22]: It was a less matter that they should be guilty , than that he , their father , should be disgraced .
Parsing [sent. 3987 len. 23]: Thinking over all this , and forgetting how late it was , I found myself half-way up the avenue of the Hall .
Parsing [sent. 3988 len. 38]: I wanted to find out whether young Weir 's fancy that the ladies he had failed in serving , or rather whom he had really served with honesty , were Mrs and Miss Oldcastle , was correct .
Parsing [sent. 3989 len. 10]: What a point it would be if it was !
Parsing [sent. 3990 len. 28]: I should not then be satisfied except I could prevail on Miss Oldcastle to accompany me to Thomas Weir , and shame the faithlessness out of him .
Parsing [sent. 3991 len. 30]: So eager was I after certainty , that it was not till I stood before the house that I saw clearly the impropriety of attempting anything further that night .
Parsing [sent. 3992 len. 18]: One light only was burning in the whole front , and that was on the first floor .
Parsing [sent. 3993 len. 42]: Glancing up at it , I knew not why , as I turned to go down the hill again , I saw a corner of the blind drawn aside and a face peeping out -- whose , I could not tell .
Parsing [sent. 3994 len. 16]: This was uncomfortable -- for what could be taking me there at such a time ?
Parsing [sent. 3995 len. 28]: But I walked steadily away , certain I could not escape recognition , and determining to refer to this ill-considered visit when I called the next day .
Parsing [sent. 3996 len. 13]: I would not put it off till Monday , I was resolved .
Parsing [sent. 3997 len. 10]: I lingered on the bridge as I went home .
Parsing [sent. 3998 len. 19]: Not a light was to be seen in the village , except one over Catherine Weir 's shop .
Parsing [sent. 3999 len. 19]: There were not many restless souls in my parish -- not so many as there ought to be .
Parsing [sent. 4000 len. 53]: Yet gladly would I see the troubled in peace -- not a moment , though , before their troubles should have brought them where the weary and heavy-laden can alone find rest to their souls -- finding the Father 's peace in the Son -- the Father himself reconciling them to Himself .
Parsing [sent. 4001 len. 6]: How still the night was !
Parsing [sent. 4002 len. 41]: My soul hung , as it were , suspended in stillness ; for the whole sphere of heaven seemed to be about me , the stars above shining as clear below in the mirror of the all but motionless water .
Parsing [sent. 4003 len. 39]: It was a pure type of the `` rest that remaineth '' -- rest , the one immovable centre wherein lie all the stores of might , whence issue all forces , all influences of making and moulding .
Parsing [sent. 4004 len. 52]: `` And , indeed , '' I said to myself , `` after all the noise , uproar , and strife that there is on the earth , after all the tempests , earthquakes , and volcanic outbursts , there is yet more of peace than of tumult in the world .
Parsing [sent. 4005 len. 36]: How many nights like this glide away in loveliness , when deep sleep hath fallen upon men , and they know neither how still their own repose , nor how beautiful the sleep of nature !
Parsing [sent. 4006 len. 11]: Ah , what must the stillness of the kingdom be ?
Parsing [sent. 4007 len. 20]: When the heavenly day 's work is done , with what a gentle wing will the night come down !
Parsing [sent. 4008 len. 49]: But I bethink me , the rest there , as here , will be the presence of God ; and if we have Him with us , the battle-field itself will be -- if not quiet , yet as full of peace as this night of stars . ''
Parsing [sent. 4009 len. 10]: So I spoke to myself , and went home .
Parsing [sent. 4010 len. 18]: I had little immediate comfort to give my young guest , but I had plenty of hope .
Parsing [sent. 4011 len. 30]: I told him he must stay in the house to-morrow ; for it would be better to have the reconciliation with his father over before he appeared in public .
Parsing [sent. 4012 len. 10]: So the next day neither Weir was at church .
Parsing [sent. 4013 len. 52]: As soon as the afternoon service was over , I went once more to the Hall , and was shown into the drawing-room -- a great faded room , in which the prevailing colour was a dingy gold , hence called the yellow drawing-room when the house had more than one .
Parsing [sent. 4014 len. 32]: It looked down upon the lawn , which , although little expense was now laid out on any of the ornamental adjuncts of the Hall , was still kept very nice .
Parsing [sent. 4015 len. 13]: There sat Mrs Oldcastle reading , with her face to the house .
Parsing [sent. 4016 len. 44]: A little way farther on , Miss Oldcastle sat , with a book on her knee , but her gaze fixed on the wide-spread landscape before her , of which , however , she seemed to be as inobservant as of her book .
Parsing [sent. 4017 len. 20]: I caught glimpses of Judy flitting hither and thither among the trees , never a moment in one place .
Parsing [sent. 4018 len. 46]: Fearful of having an interview with the old lady alone , which was not likely to lead to what I wanted , I stepped from a window which was open , out upon the terrace , and thence down the steps to the lawn below .
Parsing [sent. 4019 len. 15]: The servant had just informed Mrs Oldcastle of my visit when I came near .
Parsing [sent. 4020 len. 19]: She drew herself up in her chair , and evidently chose to regard my approach as an intrusion .
Parsing [sent. 4021 len. 22]: `` I did not expect a visit from you to-day , Mr Walton , you will allow me to say . ''
Parsing [sent. 4022 len. 11]: `` I am doing Sunday work , '' I answered .
Parsing [sent. 4023 len. 15]: `` Will you kindly tell me whether you were in London on Thursday last ?
Parsing [sent. 4024 len. 14]: But stay , allow me to ask Miss Oldcastle to join us . ''
Parsing [sent. 4025 len. 27]: Without waiting for answer , I went to Miss Oldcastle , and begged her to come and listen to something in which I wanted her help .
Parsing [sent. 4026 len. 23]: She rose courteously though without cordiality , and accompanied me to her mother , who sat with perfect rigidity , watching us .
Parsing [sent. 4027 len. 20]: `` Again let me ask , '' I said , `` if you were in London on Thursday . ''
Parsing [sent. 4028 len. 14]: Though I addressed the old lady , the answer came from her daughter .
Parsing [sent. 4029 len. 7]: `` Yes , we were . ''
Parsing [sent. 4030 len. 14]: `` Were you in -- & Co. 's , in -- Street ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4031 len. 12]: But now before Miss Oldcastle could reply , her mother interposed .
Parsing [sent. 4032 len. 10]: `` Are we charged with shoplifting , Mr Walton ?
Parsing [sent. 4033 len. 16]: Really , one is not accustomed to such cross-questioning -- except from a lawyer . ''
Parsing [sent. 4034 len. 13]: `` Have patience with me for a moment , '' I returned .
Parsing [sent. 4035 len. 16]: `` I am not going to be mysterious for more than two or three questions .
Parsing [sent. 4036 len. 13]: Please tell me whether you were in that shop or not . ''
Parsing [sent. 4037 len. 11]: `` I believe we were , '' said the mother .
Parsing [sent. 4038 len. 10]: `` Yes , certainly , '' said the daughter .
Parsing [sent. 4039 len. 7]: `` Did you buy anything ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4040 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 4041 len. 7]: We -- '' Miss Oldcastle began .
Parsing [sent. 4042 len. 11]: `` Not a word more , '' I exclaimed eagerly .
Parsing [sent. 4043 len. 8]: `` Come with me at once . ''
Parsing [sent. 4044 len. 10]: `` What DO you mean , Mr Walton ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4045 len. 21]: said the mother , with a sort of cold indignation , while the daughter looked surprised , but said nothing .
Parsing [sent. 4046 len. 19]: `` I beg your pardon for my impetuosity ; but much is in your power at this moment .
Parsing [sent. 4047 len. 13]: The son of one of my parishioners has come home in trouble .
Parsing [sent. 4048 len. 11]: His father , Thomas Weir -- '' `` Ah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4049 len. 13]: said Mrs Oldcastle , in a tone considerably at strife with refinement .
Parsing [sent. 4050 len. 6]: But I took no notice .
Parsing [sent. 4051 len. 9]: `` His father will not believe his story .
Parsing [sent. 4052 len. 15]: The lad thinks you were the ladies in serving whom he got into trouble .
Parsing [sent. 4053 len. 45]: I am so confident he tells the truth , that I want Miss Oldcastle to be so kind as to accompany me to Weir 's house -- '' `` Really , Mr Walton , I am astonished at your making such a request ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4054 len. 20]: exclaimed Mrs Oldcastle , with suitable emphasis on every salient syllable , while her white face flushed with anger .
Parsing [sent. 4055 len. 23]: `` To ask Miss Oldcastle to accompany you to the dwelling of the ringleader of all the canaille of the neighbourhood ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4056 len. 13]: `` It is for the sake of justice , '' I interposed .
Parsing [sent. 4057 len. 8]: `` That is no concern of ours .
Parsing [sent. 4058 len. 25]: Let them fight it out between them , I am sure any trouble that comes of it is no more than they all deserve .
Parsing [sent. 4059 len. 11]: A low family -- men and women of them . ''
Parsing [sent. 4060 len. 11]: `` I assure you , I think very differently . ''
Parsing [sent. 4061 len. 7]: `` I daresay you do . ''
Parsing [sent. 4062 len. 16]: `` But neither your opinion nor mine has anything to do with the matter . ''
Parsing [sent. 4063 len. 62]: Here I turned to Miss Oldcastle and went on -- `` It is a chance which seldom occurs in one 's life , Miss Oldcastle -- a chance of setting wrong right by a word ; and as a minister of the gospel of truth and love , I beg you to assist me with your presence to that end . ''
Parsing [sent. 4064 len. 23]: I would have spoken more strongly , but I knew that her word given to me would be enough without her presence .
Parsing [sent. 4065 len. 59]: At the same time , I felt not only that there would be a propriety in her taking a personal interest in the matter , but that it would do her good , and tend to create a favour towards each other in some of my flock between whom at present there seemed to be nothing in common .
Parsing [sent. 4066 len. 25]: But at my last words , Mrs Oldcastle rose to her feet no longer red -- now whiter than her usual whiteness with passion .
Parsing [sent. 4067 len. 6]: `` You dare to persist !
Parsing [sent. 4068 len. 32]: You take advantage of your profession to persist in dragging my daughter into a vile dispute between mechanics of the lowest class -- against the positive command of her only parent !
Parsing [sent. 4069 len. 10]: Have you no respect for her position in society ?
Parsing [sent. 4070 len. 5]: -- for her sex ?
Parsing [sent. 4071 len. 14]: MISTER WALTON , you act in a manner unworthy of your cloth . ''
Parsing [sent. 4072 len. 16]: I had stood looking in her eyes with as much self-possession as I could muster .
Parsing [sent. 4073 len. 17]: And I believe I should have borne it all quietly , but for that last word .
Parsing [sent. 4074 len. 26]: If there is one epithet I hate more than another , it is that execrable word CLOTH -- used for the office of a clergyman .
Parsing [sent. 4075 len. 11]: I have no time to set forth its offence now .
Parsing [sent. 4076 len. 18]: If my reader can not feel it , I do not care to make him feel it .
Parsing [sent. 4077 len. 11]: Only I am sorry to say it overcame my temper .
Parsing [sent. 4078 len. 15]: `` Madam , '' I said , `` I owe nothing to my tailor .
Parsing [sent. 4079 len. 18]: But I owe God my whole being , and my neighbour all I can do for him .
Parsing [sent. 4080 len. 22]: ` He that loveth not his brother is a murderer , ' or murderess , as the case may be . ''
Parsing [sent. 4081 len. 17]: At that word MURDERESS , her face became livid , and she turned away without reply .
Parsing [sent. 4082 len. 12]: By this time her daughter was half way to the house .
Parsing [sent. 4083 len. 4]: She followed her .
Parsing [sent. 4084 len. 47]: And here was I left to go home , with the full knowledge that , partly from trying to gain too much , and partly from losing my temper , I had at best but a mangled and unsatisfactory testimony to carry back to Thomas Weir .
Parsing [sent. 4085 len. 28]: Of course I walked away -- round the end of the house and down the avenue ; and the farther I went the more mortified I grew .
Parsing [sent. 4086 len. 31]: It was not merely the shame of losing my temper , though that was a shame -- and with a woman too , merely because she used a common epithet !
Parsing [sent. 4087 len. 42]: -- but I saw that it must appear very strange to the carpenter that I was not able to give a more explicit account of some sort , what I had learned not being in the least decisive in the matter .
Parsing [sent. 4088 len. 25]: It only amounted to this , that Mrs and Miss Oldcastle were in the shop on the very day on which Weir was dismissed .
Parsing [sent. 4089 len. 17]: It proved that so much of what he had told me was correct -- nothing more .
Parsing [sent. 4090 len. 29]: And if I tried to better the matter by explaining how I had offended them , would it not deepen the very hatred I had hoped to overcome ?
Parsing [sent. 4091 len. 59]: In fact , I stood convicted before the tribunal of my own conscience of having lost all the certain good of my attempt , in part at least from the foolish desire to produce a conviction OF Weir rather than IN Weir , which should be triumphant after a melodramatic fashion , and -- must I confess it ?
Parsing [sent. 4092 len. 50]: -- should PUNISH him for not believing in his son when _ I _ did ; forgetting in my miserable selfishness that not to believe in his son was an unspeakably worse punishment in itself than any conviction or consequent shame brought about by the most overwhelming of stage-effects .
Parsing [sent. 4093 len. 9]: I assure my reader , I felt humiliated .
Parsing [sent. 4094 len. 14]: Now I think humiliation is a very different condition of mind from humility .
Parsing [sent. 4095 len. 12]: Humiliation no man can desire : it is shame and torture .
Parsing [sent. 4096 len. 14]: Humility is the true , right condition of humanity -- peaceful , divine .
Parsing [sent. 4097 len. 60]: And yet a man may gladly welcome humiliation when it comes , if he finds that with fierce shock and rude revulsion it has turned him right round , with his face away from pride , whither he was travelling , and towards humility , however far away upon the horizon 's verge she may sit waiting for him .
Parsing [sent. 4098 len. 52]: To me , however , there came a gentle and not therefore less effective dissolution of the bonds both of pride and humiliation ; and before Weir and I met , I was nearly as anxious to heal his wounded spirit , as I was to work justice for his son .
Parsing [sent. 4099 len. 51]: I was walking slowly , with burning cheek and downcast eyes , the one of conflict , the other of shame and defeat , away from the great house , which seemed to be staring after me down the avenue with all its window-eyes , when suddenly my deliverance came .
Parsing [sent. 4100 len. 39]: At a somewhat sharp turn , where the avenue changed into a winding road , Miss Oldcastle stood waiting for me , the glow of haste upon her cheek , and the firmness of resolution upon her lips .
Parsing [sent. 4101 len. 16]: Once more I was startled by her sudden presence , but she did not smile .
Parsing [sent. 4102 len. 12]: `` Mr Walton , what do you want me to do ?
Parsing [sent. 4103 len. 23]: I would not willing refuse , if it is , as you say , really my duty to go with you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4104 len. 13]: `` I can not be positive about that , '' I answered .
Parsing [sent. 4105 len. 9]: `` I think I put it too strongly .
Parsing [sent. 4106 len. 32]: But it would be a considerable advantage , I think , if you WOULD go with me and let me ask you a few questions in the presence of Thomas Weir .
Parsing [sent. 4107 len. 39]: It will have more effect if I am able to tell him that I have only learned as yet that you were in the shop on that day , and refer him to you for the rest . ''
Parsing [sent. 4108 len. 6]: `` I will go . ''
Parsing [sent. 4109 len. 5]: `` A thousand thanks .
Parsing [sent. 4110 len. 9]: But how did you manage to -- ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4111 len. 12]: Here I stopped , not knowing how to finish the question .
Parsing [sent. 4112 len. 17]: `` You are surprised that I came , notwithstanding mamma 's objection to my going ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4113 len. 6]: `` I confess I am .
Parsing [sent. 4114 len. 15]: I should not have been surprised at Judy 's doing so , now . ''
Parsing [sent. 4115 len. 7]: She was silent for a moment .
Parsing [sent. 4116 len. 13]: `` Do you think obedience to parents is to last for ever ?
Parsing [sent. 4117 len. 7]: The honour is , of course .
Parsing [sent. 4118 len. 17]: But I am surely old enough to be right in following my conscience at least . ''
Parsing [sent. 4119 len. 5]: `` You mistake me .
Parsing [sent. 4120 len. 8]: That is not the difficulty at all .
Parsing [sent. 4121 len. 25]: Of course you ought to do what is right against the highest authority on earth , which I take to be just the parental .
Parsing [sent. 4122 len. 10]: What I am surprised at is your courage . ''
Parsing [sent. 4123 len. 14]: `` Not because of its degree , only that it is mine ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4124 len. 4]: And she sighed .
Parsing [sent. 4125 len. 15]: -- She was quite right , and I did not know what to answer .
Parsing [sent. 4126 len. 4]: But she resumed .
Parsing [sent. 4127 len. 7]: `` I know I am cowardly .
Parsing [sent. 4128 len. 11]: But if I can not dare , I can bear .
Parsing [sent. 4129 len. 5]: Is it not strange ?
Parsing [sent. 4130 len. 22]: -- With my mother looking at me , I dare not say a word , dare hardly move against her will .
Parsing [sent. 4131 len. 9]: And it is not always a good will .
Parsing [sent. 4132 len. 10]: I can not honour my mother as I would .
Parsing [sent. 4133 len. 55]: But the moment her eyes are off me , I can do anything , knowing the consequences perfectly , and just as regardless of them ; for , as I tell you , Mr Walton , I can endure ; and you do not know what that might COME to mean with my mother .
Parsing [sent. 4134 len. 27]: Once she kept me shut up in my room , and sent me only bread and water , for a whole week to the very hour .
Parsing [sent. 4135 len. 23]: Not that I minded that much , but it will let you know a little of my position in my own home .
Parsing [sent. 4136 len. 9]: That is why I walked away before her .
Parsing [sent. 4137 len. 7]: I saw what was coming . ''
Parsing [sent. 4138 len. 36]: And Miss Oldcastle drew herself up with more expression of pride than I had yet seen in her , revealing to me that perhaps I had hitherto quite misunderstood the source of her apparent haughtiness .
Parsing [sent. 4139 len. 7]: I could not reply for indignation .
Parsing [sent. 4140 len. 13]: My silence must have been the cause of what she said next .
Parsing [sent. 4141 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 4142 len. 14]: you think I have no right to speak so about my own mother !
Parsing [sent. 4143 len. 2]: Well !
Parsing [sent. 4144 len. 2]: well !
Parsing [sent. 4145 len. 13]: But indeed I would not have done so a month ago . ''
Parsing [sent. 4146 len. 20]: `` If I am silent , Miss Oldcastle , it is that my sympathy is too strong for me .
Parsing [sent. 4147 len. 6]: There are mothers and mothers .
Parsing [sent. 4148 len. 14]: And for a mother not to be a mother is too dreadful . ''
Parsing [sent. 4149 len. 5]: She made no reply .
Parsing [sent. 4150 len. 3]: I resumed .
Parsing [sent. 4151 len. 63]: `` It will seem cruel , perhaps ; -- certainly in saying it , I lay myself open to the rejoinder that talk is SO easy ; -- still I shall feel more honest when I have said it : the only thing I feel should be altered in your conduct -- forgive me -- is that you should DARE your mother .
Parsing [sent. 4152 len. 19]: Do not think , for it is an unfortunate phrase , that my meaning is a vulgar one .
Parsing [sent. 4153 len. 17]: If it were , I should at least know better than to utter it to you .
Parsing [sent. 4154 len. 35]: What I mean is , that you ought to be able to be and do the same before your mother 's eyes , that you are and do when she is out of sight .
Parsing [sent. 4155 len. 19]: I mean that you should look in your mother 's eyes , and do what is RIGHT . ''
Parsing [sent. 4156 len. 10]: `` I KNOW that -- know it WELL . ''
Parsing [sent. 4157 len. 10]: -LRB- She emphasized the words as I do . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 4158 len. 25]: `` But you do not know what a spell she casts upon me ; how impossible it is to do as you say . ''
Parsing [sent. 4159 len. 6]: `` Difficult , I allow .
Parsing [sent. 4160 len. 4]: Impossible , not .
Parsing [sent. 4161 len. 11]: You will never be free till you do so . ''
Parsing [sent. 4162 len. 8]: `` You are too hard upon me .
Parsing [sent. 4163 len. 49]: Besides , though you will scarcely be able to believe it now , I DO honour her , and can not help feeling that by doing as I do , I avoid irreverence , impertinence , rudeness -- whichever is the right word for what I mean . ''
Parsing [sent. 4164 len. 6]: `` I understand you perfectly .
Parsing [sent. 4165 len. 42]: But the truth is more than propriety of behaviour , even to a parent ; and indeed has in it a deeper reverence , or the germ of it at least , than any adherence to the mere code of respect .
Parsing [sent. 4166 len. 31]: If you once did as I want you to do , you would find that in reality you both revered and loved your mother more than you do now . ''
Parsing [sent. 4167 len. 6]: `` You may be right .
Parsing [sent. 4168 len. 15]: But I am certain you speak without any real idea of the difficulty . ''
Parsing [sent. 4169 len. 5]: `` That may be .
Parsing [sent. 4170 len. 11]: And yet what I say remains just as true . ''
Parsing [sent. 4171 len. 11]: `` How could I meet VIOLENCE , for instance ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4172 len. 4]: `` Impossible ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4173 len. 5]: She returned no reply .
Parsing [sent. 4174 len. 8]: We walked in silence for some minutes .
Parsing [sent. 4175 len. 18]: At length she said , `` My mother 's self-will amounts to madness , I do believe .
Parsing [sent. 4176 len. 13]: I have yet to learn where she would stop of herself . ''
Parsing [sent. 4177 len. 30]: `` All self-will is madness , '' I returned -- stupidly enough For what is the use of making general remarks when you have a terrible concrete before you ?
Parsing [sent. 4178 len. 24]: `` To want one 's own way just and only because it is one 's own way is the height of madness . ''
Parsing [sent. 4179 len. 3]: `` Perhaps .
Parsing [sent. 4180 len. 26]: But when madness has to be encountered as if it were sense , it makes it no easier to know that it is madness . ''
Parsing [sent. 4181 len. 10]: `` Does your uncle give you no help ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4182 len. 3]: `` He !
Parsing [sent. 4183 len. 3]: Poor man !
Parsing [sent. 4184 len. 10]: He is as frightened at her as I am .
Parsing [sent. 4185 len. 7]: He dares not even go away .
Parsing [sent. 4186 len. 16]: He did not know what he was coming to when he came to Oldcastle Hall .
Parsing [sent. 4187 len. 3]: Dear uncle !
Parsing [sent. 4188 len. 7]: I owe him a great deal .
Parsing [sent. 4189 len. 18]: But for any help of that sort , he is of no more use than a child .
Parsing [sent. 4190 len. 11]: I believe mamma looks upon him as half an idiot .
Parsing [sent. 4191 len. 16]: He can do anything or everything but help one to live , to BE anything .
Parsing [sent. 4192 len. 3]: Oh me !
Parsing [sent. 4193 len. 6]: I AM so tired ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4194 len. 19]: And the PROUD lady , as I had thought her , perhaps not incorrectly , burst out crying .
Parsing [sent. 4195 len. 6]: What was I to do ?
Parsing [sent. 4196 len. 8]: I did not know in the least .
Parsing [sent. 4197 len. 11]: What I said , I do not even now know .
Parsing [sent. 4198 len. 32]: But by this time we were at the gate , and as soon as we had passed the guardian monstrosities , we found the open road an effectual antidote to tears .
Parsing [sent. 4199 len. 28]: When we came within sight of the old house where Weir lived , Miss Oldcastle became again a little curious as to what I required of her .
Parsing [sent. 4200 len. 8]: `` Trust me , '' I said .
Parsing [sent. 4201 len. 8]: `` There is nothing mysterious about it .
Parsing [sent. 4202 len. 19]: Only I prefer the truth to come out fresh in the ears of the man most concerned . ''
Parsing [sent. 4203 len. 10]: `` I do trust you , '' she answered .
Parsing [sent. 4204 len. 7]: And we knocked at the house-door .
Parsing [sent. 4205 len. 14]: Thomas Weir himself opened the door , with a candle in his hand .
Parsing [sent. 4206 len. 10]: He looked very much astonished to see his lady-visitor .
Parsing [sent. 4207 len. 23]: He asked us , politely enough , to walk up-stairs , and ushered us into the large room I have already described .
Parsing [sent. 4208 len. 20]: There sat the old man , as I had first seen him , by the side of the fire .
Parsing [sent. 4209 len. 37]: He received us with more than politeness -- with courtesy ; and I could not help glancing at Miss Oldcastle to see what impression this family of `` low , free-thinking republicans '' made upon her .
Parsing [sent. 4210 len. 13]: It was easy to discover that the impression was of favourable surprise .
Parsing [sent. 4211 len. 15]: But I was as much surprised at her behaviour as she was at theirs .
Parsing [sent. 4212 len. 23]: Not a haughty tone was to be heard in her voice ; not a haughty movement to be seen in her form .
Parsing [sent. 4213 len. 37]: She accepted the chair offered her , and sat down , perfectly at home , by the fireside , only that she turned towards me , waiting for what explanation I might think proper to give .
Parsing [sent. 4214 len. 16]: Before I had time to speak , however , old Mr Weir broke the silence .
Parsing [sent. 4215 len. 32]: `` I 've been telling Tom , sir , as I 've told him many a time afore , as how he 's a deal too hard with his children . ''
Parsing [sent. 4216 len. 4]: `` Father ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4217 len. 5]: interrupted Thomas , angrily .
Parsing [sent. 4218 len. 20]: `` Have patience a bit , my boy , '' persisted the old man , turning again towards me .
Parsing [sent. 4219 len. 41]: -- `` Now , sir , he wo n't even hear young Tom 's side of the story ; and I say that boy wo n't tell him no lie if he 's the same boy he went away . ''
Parsing [sent. 4220 len. 24]: `` I tell you , father , '' again began Thomas ; but this time I interposed , to prevent useless talk beforehand .
Parsing [sent. 4221 len. 12]: `` Thomas , '' I said , `` listen to me .
Parsing [sent. 4222 len. 11]: I have heard your son 's side of the story .
Parsing [sent. 4223 len. 26]: Because of something he said I went to Miss Oldcastle , and asked her whether she was in his late master 's shop last Thursday .
Parsing [sent. 4224 len. 19]: That is all I have asked her , and all she has told me is that she was .
Parsing [sent. 4225 len. 33]: I know no more than you what she is going to reply to my questions now , but I have no doubt her answers will correspond to your son 's story . ''
Parsing [sent. 4226 len. 80]: I then put my questions to Miss Oldcastle , whose answers amounted to this : -- That they had wanted to buy a shawl ; that they had seen none good enough ; that they had left the shop without buying anything ; and that they had been waited upon by a young man , who , while perfectly polite and attentive to their wants , did not seem to have the ways or manners of a London shop-lad .
Parsing [sent. 4227 len. 33]: I then told them the story as young Tom had related it to me , and asked if his sister was not in the house and might not go to fetch him .
Parsing [sent. 4228 len. 8]: But she was with her sister Catherine .
Parsing [sent. 4229 len. 26]: `` I think , Mr Walton , if you have done with me , I ought to go home now , '' said Miss Oldcastle .
Parsing [sent. 4230 len. 7]: `` Certainly , '' I answered .
Parsing [sent. 4231 len. 9]: `` I will take you home at once .
Parsing [sent. 4232 len. 10]: I am greatly obliged to you for coming . ''
Parsing [sent. 4233 len. 31]: `` Indeed , sir , '' said the old man , rising with difficulty , `` we 're obliged both to you and the lady more than we can tell .
Parsing [sent. 4234 len. 10]: To take such a deal of trouble for us !
Parsing [sent. 4235 len. 33]: But you see , sir , you 're one of them as thinks a man 's got his duty to do one way or another , whether he be clergyman or carpenter .
Parsing [sent. 4236 len. 6]: God bless you , Miss. .
Parsing [sent. 4237 len. 36]: You 're of the right sort , which you 'll excuse an old man , Miss , as 'll never see ye again till ye 've got the wings as ye ought to have . ''
Parsing [sent. 4238 len. 22]: Miss Oldcastle smiled very sweetly , and answered nothing , but shook hands with them both , and bade them good-night .
Parsing [sent. 4239 len. 15]: Weir could not speak a word ; he could hardly even lift his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4240 len. 40]: But a red spot glowed on each of his pale cheeks , making him look very like his daughter Catherine , and I could see Miss Oldcastle wince and grow red too with the gripe he gave her hand .
Parsing [sent. 4241 len. 9]: But she smiled again none the less sweetly .
Parsing [sent. 4242 len. 30]: `` I will see Miss Oldcastle home , and then go back to my house and bring the boy with me , '' I said , as we left .
Parsing [sent. 4243 len. 10]: It was some time before either of us spoke .
Parsing [sent. 4244 len. 36]: The sun was setting , the sky the earth and the air lovely with rosy light , and the world full of that peculiar calm which belongs to the evening of the day of rest .
Parsing [sent. 4245 len. 11]: Surely the world ought to wake better on the morrow .
Parsing [sent. 4246 len. 12]: `` Not very dangerous people , those , Miss Oldcastle ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4247 len. 6]: I said , at last .
Parsing [sent. 4248 len. 19]: `` I thank you very much for taking me to see them , '' she returned , cordially .
Parsing [sent. 4249 len. 18]: `` You wo n't believe all you may happen to hear against the working people now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4250 len. 6]: `` I never did . ''
Parsing [sent. 4251 len. 16]: `` There are ill-conditioned , cross-grained , low-minded , selfish , unbelieving people amongst them .
Parsing [sent. 4252 len. 4]: God knows it .
Parsing [sent. 4253 len. 11]: But there are ladies and gentlemen amongst them too . ''
Parsing [sent. 4254 len. 9]: `` That old man is a gentleman . ''
Parsing [sent. 4255 len. 4]: `` He is .
Parsing [sent. 4256 len. 19]: And the only way to teach them all to be such , is to be such to them .
Parsing [sent. 4257 len. 22]: The man who does not show himself a gentleman to the working people -- why should I call them the poor ?
Parsing [sent. 4258 len. 33]: some of them are better off than many of the rich , for they can pay their debts , and do it -- '' I had forgot the beginning of my sentence .
Parsing [sent. 4259 len. 50]: `` You were saying that the man who does not show himself a gentleman to the poor -- '' `` Is no gentleman at all -- only a gentle without the man ; and if you consult my namesake old Izaak , you will find what that is . ''
Parsing [sent. 4260 len. 5]: `` I will look .
Parsing [sent. 4261 len. 6]: I know your way now .
Parsing [sent. 4262 len. 14]: You wo n't tell me anything I can find out for myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 4263 len. 9]: `` Is it not the best way ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4264 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 4265 len. 18]: Because , for one thing , you find out so much more than you look for . ''
Parsing [sent. 4266 len. 10]: `` Certainly that has been my own experience . ''
Parsing [sent. 4267 len. 10]: `` Are you a descendant of Izaak Walton ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4268 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 4269 len. 6]: I believe there are none .
Parsing [sent. 4270 len. 20]: But I hope I have so much of his spirit that I can do two things like him . ''
Parsing [sent. 4271 len. 5]: `` Tell me . ''
Parsing [sent. 4272 len. 26]: `` Live in the country , though I was not brought up in it ; and know a good man when I see him . ''
Parsing [sent. 4273 len. 13]: `` I am very glad you asked me to go to-night . ''
Parsing [sent. 4274 len. 22]: `` If people only knew their own brothers and sisters , the kingdom of heaven would not be far off . ''
Parsing [sent. 4275 len. 26]: I do not think Miss Oldcastle quite liked this , for she was silent thereafter ; though I allow that her silence was not conclusive .
Parsing [sent. 4276 len. 10]: And we had now come close to the house .
Parsing [sent. 4277 len. 12]: `` I wish I could help you , '' I said .
Parsing [sent. 4278 len. 5]: `` In what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4279 len. 11]: `` To bear what I fear is waiting you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4280 len. 10]: `` I told you I was equal to that .
Parsing [sent. 4281 len. 11]: It is where we are unequal that we want help .
Parsing [sent. 4282 len. 14]: You may have to give it me some day -- who knows ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4283 len. 36]: I left her most unwillingly in the porch , just as Sarah -LRB- the white wolf -RRB- had her hand on the door , rejoicing in my heart , however , over her last words .
Parsing [sent. 4284 len. 33]: My reader will not be surprised , after all this , if , before I get very much further with my story , I have to confess that I loved Miss Oldcastle .
Parsing [sent. 4285 len. 18]: When young Tom and I entered the room , his grandfather rose and tottered to meet him .
Parsing [sent. 4286 len. 11]: His father made one step towards him and then hesitated .
Parsing [sent. 4287 len. 23]: Of all conditions of the human mind , that of being ashamed of himself must have been the strangest to Thomas Weir .
Parsing [sent. 4288 len. 34]: The man had never in his life , I believe , done anything mean or dishonest , and therefore he had had less frequent opportunities than most people of being ashamed of himself .
Parsing [sent. 4289 len. 13]: Hence his fall had been from another pinnacle -- that of pride .
Parsing [sent. 4290 len. 46]: When a man thinks it such a fine thing to have done right , he might almost as well have done wrong , for it shows he considers right something EXTRA , not absolutely essential to human existence , not the life of a man .
Parsing [sent. 4291 len. 88]: I call it Thomas Weir 's fall ; for surely to behave in an unfatherly manner to both daughter and son -- the one sinful , and therefore needing the more tenderness -- the other innocent , and therefore claiming justification -- and to do so from pride , and hurt pride , was fall enough in one history , worse a great deal than many sins that go by harder names ; for the world 's judgment of wrong does not exactly correspond with the reality .
Parsing [sent. 4292 len. 25]: And now if he was humbled in the one instance , there would be room to hope he might become humble in the other .
Parsing [sent. 4293 len. 38]: But I had soon to see that , for a time , his pride , driven from its entrenchment against his son , only retreated , with all its forces , into the other against his daughter .
Parsing [sent. 4294 len. 31]: Before a moment had passed , justice overcame so far that he held out his hand and said : -- `` Come , Tom , let by-gones be by-gones . ''
Parsing [sent. 4295 len. 5]: But I stepped between .
Parsing [sent. 4296 len. 55]: `` Thomas Weir , '' I said , `` I have too great a regard for you -- and you know I dare not flatter you -- to let you off this way , or rather leave you to think you have done your duty when you have not done the half of it .
Parsing [sent. 4297 len. 12]: You have done your son a wrong , a great wrong .
Parsing [sent. 4298 len. 97]: How can you claim to be a gentleman -- I say nothing of being a Christian , for therein you make no claim -- how , I say , can you claim to act like a gentleman , if , having done a man wrong -- his being your own son has nothing to do with the matter one way or other , except that it ought to make you see your duty more easily -- having done him wrong , why do n't you beg his pardon , I say , like a man ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4299 len. 7]: He did not move a step .
Parsing [sent. 4300 len. 30]: But young Tom stepped hurriedly forward , and catching his father 's hand in both of his , cried out : `` My father sha n't beg my pardon .
Parsing [sent. 4301 len. 24]: I beg yours , father , for everything I ever did to displease you , but I WAS N'T to blame in this .
Parsing [sent. 4302 len. 7]: I was n't , indeed . ''
Parsing [sent. 4303 len. 18]: `` Tom , I beg your pardon , '' said the hard man , overcome at last .
Parsing [sent. 4304 len. 28]: `` And now , sir , '' he added , turning to me , `` will you let by-gones be by-gones between my boy and me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4305 len. 11]: There was just a touch of bitterness in his tone .
Parsing [sent. 4306 len. 10]: `` With all my heart , '' I replied .
Parsing [sent. 4307 len. 17]: `` But I want just a word with you in the shop before I go . ''
Parsing [sent. 4308 len. 27]: `` Certainly , '' he answered , stiffly ; and I bade the old and the young man good night , and followed him down stairs .
Parsing [sent. 4309 len. 38]: `` Thomas , my friend , '' I said , when we got into the shop , laying my hand on his shoulder , `` will you after this say that God has dealt hardly with you ?
Parsing [sent. 4310 len. 18]: There 's a son for any man God ever made to give thanks for on his knees !
Parsing [sent. 4311 len. 30]: Thomas , you have a strong sense of fair play in your heart , and you GIVE fair play neither to your own son nor yet to God himself .
Parsing [sent. 4312 len. 54]: You close your doors and brood over your own miseries , and the wrongs people have done you ; whereas , if you would but open those doors , you might come out into the light of God 's truth , and see that His heart is as clear as sunlight towards you .
Parsing [sent. 4313 len. 40]: You wo n't believe this , and therefore naturally you ca n't quite believe that there is a God at all ; for , indeed , a being that was not all light would be no God at all .
Parsing [sent. 4314 len. 33]: If you would but let Him teach you , you would find your perplexities melt away like the snow in spring , till you could hardly believe you had ever felt them .
Parsing [sent. 4315 len. 32]: No arguing will convince you of a God ; but let Him once come in , and all argument will be tenfold useless to convince you that there is no God .
Parsing [sent. 4316 len. 4]: Give God justice .
Parsing [sent. 4317 len. 7]: Try Him as I have said .
Parsing [sent. 4318 len. 5]: -- Good night . ''
Parsing [sent. 4319 len. 11]: He did not return my farewell with a single word .
Parsing [sent. 4320 len. 17]: But the grasp of his strong rough hand was more earnest and loving even than usual .
Parsing [sent. 4321 len. 29]: I could not see his face , for it was almost dark ; but , indeed , I felt that it was better I could not see it .
Parsing [sent. 4322 len. 27]: I went home as peaceful in my heart as the night whose curtains God had drawn about the earth that it might sleep till the morrow .
Parsing [sent. 4323 len. 3]: CHAPTER XIV .
Parsing [sent. 4324 len. 3]: MY PUPIL .
Parsing [sent. 4325 len. 27]: Although I do happen to know how Miss Oldcastle fared that night after I left her , the painful record is not essential to my story .
Parsing [sent. 4326 len. 28]: Besides , I have hitherto recorded only those things `` quorum pars magna '' -- or minima , as the case may be -- `` fui . ''
Parsing [sent. 4327 len. 25]: There is one exception , old Weir 's story , for the introduction of which my reader can not yet see the artistic reason .
Parsing [sent. 4328 len. 51]: For whether a story be real in fact , or only real in meaning , there must always be an idea , or artistic model in the brain , after which it is fashioned : in the latter case one of invention , in the former case one of choice .
Parsing [sent. 4329 len. 42]: In the middle of the following week I was returning from a visit I had paid to Tomkins and his wife , when I met , in the only street of the village , my good and honoured friend Dr Duncan .
Parsing [sent. 4330 len. 56]: Of course I saw him often -- and I beg my reader to remember that this is no diary , but only a gathering together of some of the more remarkable facts of my history , admitting of being ideally grouped -- but this time I recall distinctly because the interview bore upon many things .
Parsing [sent. 4331 len. 19]: `` Well , Dr Duncan , '' I said , `` busy as usual fighting the devil . ''
Parsing [sent. 4332 len. 34]: `` Ah , my dear Mr Walton , '' returned the doctor -- and a kind word from him went a long way into my heart -- `` I know what you mean .
Parsing [sent. 4333 len. 16]: You fight the devil from the inside , and I fight him from the outside .
Parsing [sent. 4334 len. 8]: My chance is a poor one . ''
Parsing [sent. 4335 len. 15]: `` It would be , perhaps , if you were confined to outside remedies .
Parsing [sent. 4336 len. 18]: But what an opportunity your profession gives you of attacking the enemy from the inside as well !
Parsing [sent. 4337 len. 29]: And you have this advantage over us , that no man can say it belongs to your profession to say such things , and THEREFORE disregard them . ''
Parsing [sent. 4338 len. 22]: `` Ah , Mr Walton , I have too great a respect for your profession to dare to interfere with it .
Parsing [sent. 4339 len. 59]: The doctor in ` Macbeth , ' you know , could ` not minister to a mind diseased , Pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow , Raze out the written troubles of the brain , And with some sweet oblivious antidote Cleanse the stuff 'd bosom of that perilous stuff Which weighs upon the heart . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 4340 len. 7]: `` What a memory you have !
Parsing [sent. 4341 len. 15]: But you do n't think I can do that any more than you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4342 len. 11]: `` You know the best medicine to give , anyhow .
Parsing [sent. 4343 len. 6]: I wish I always did .
Parsing [sent. 4344 len. 10]: But you see we have no theriaca now . ''
Parsing [sent. 4345 len. 6]: `` Well , we have .
Parsing [sent. 4346 len. 19]: For the Lord says , ` Come unto me , and I will give you rest . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 4347 len. 3]: `` There !
Parsing [sent. 4348 len. 4]: I told you !
Parsing [sent. 4349 len. 7]: That will meet all diseases . ''
Parsing [sent. 4350 len. 48]: `` Strangely now , there comes into my mind a line of Chaucer , with which I will make a small return for your quotation from Shakespeare ; you have mentioned theriaca ; and I , without thinking of this line , quoted our Lord 's words .
Parsing [sent. 4351 len. 24]: Chaucer brings the two together , for the word triacle is merely a corruption of theriaca , the unfailing cure for every thing .
Parsing [sent. 4352 len. 13]: ` Crist , which that is to every harm triacle . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 4353 len. 9]: `` That is delightful : I thank you .
Parsing [sent. 4354 len. 7]: And that is in Chaucer ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4355 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 4356 len. 7]: In the Man-of-Law 's Tale . ''
Parsing [sent. 4357 len. 16]: `` Shall I tell you how I was able to quote so correctly from Shakespeare ?
Parsing [sent. 4358 len. 10]: I have just come from referring to the passage .
Parsing [sent. 4359 len. 18]: And I mention that because I want to tell you what made me think of the passage .
Parsing [sent. 4360 len. 9]: I had been to see poor Catherine Weir .
Parsing [sent. 4361 len. 10]: I think she is not long for this world .
Parsing [sent. 4362 len. 15]: She has a bad cough , and I fear her lungs are going . ''
Parsing [sent. 4363 len. 8]: `` I am concerned to hear that .
Parsing [sent. 4364 len. 11]: I considered her very delicate , and am not surprised .
Parsing [sent. 4365 len. 29]: But I wish , I do wish , I had got a little hold of her before , that I might be of some use to her now .
Parsing [sent. 4366 len. 11]: Is she in immediate danger , do you think ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4367 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 4368 len. 6]: I do not think so .
Parsing [sent. 4369 len. 9]: But I have no expectation of her recovery .
Parsing [sent. 4370 len. 15]: Very likely she will just live through the winter and die in the spring .
Parsing [sent. 4371 len. 10]: Those patients so often go as the flowers come !
Parsing [sent. 4372 len. 14]: All her coughing , poor woman , will not cleanse her stuffed bosom .
Parsing [sent. 4373 len. 20]: The perilous stuff weighs on her heart , as Shakespeare says , as well as on her lungs . ''
Parsing [sent. 4374 len. 5]: `` Ah , dear !
Parsing [sent. 4375 len. 12]: What is it , doctor , that weighs upon her heart ?
Parsing [sent. 4376 len. 9]: Is it shame , or what is it ?
Parsing [sent. 4377 len. 17]: for she is so uncommunicative that I hardly know anything at all about her yet . ''
Parsing [sent. 4378 len. 6]: `` I can not tell .
Parsing [sent. 4379 len. 8]: She has the faculty of silence . ''
Parsing [sent. 4380 len. 16]: `` But do not think I complain that she has not made me her confessor .
Parsing [sent. 4381 len. 35]: I only mean that if she would talk at all , one would have a chance of knowing something of the state of her mind , and so might give her some help . ''
Parsing [sent. 4382 len. 17]: `` Perhaps she will break down all at once , and open her mind to you .
Parsing [sent. 4383 len. 9]: I have not told her she is dying .
Parsing [sent. 4384 len. 21]: I think a medical man ought at least to be quite sure before he dares to say such a thing .
Parsing [sent. 4385 len. 26]: I have known a long life injured , to human view at least , by the medical verdict in youth of ever imminent death . ''
Parsing [sent. 4386 len. 25]: `` Certainly one has no right to say what God is going to do with any one till he knows it beyond a doubt .
Parsing [sent. 4387 len. 28]: Illness has its own peculiar mission , independent of any association with coming death , and may often work better when mingled with the hope of life .
Parsing [sent. 4388 len. 18]: I mean we must take care of presumption when we measure God 's plans by our theories .
Parsing [sent. 4389 len. 23]: But could you not suggest something , Doctor Duncan , to guide me in trying to do my duty by her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4390 len. 5]: `` I can not .
Parsing [sent. 4391 len. 33]: You see you do n't know what she is THINKING ; and till you know that , I presume you will agree with me that all is an aim in the dark .
Parsing [sent. 4392 len. 9]: How can I prescribe , without SOME diagnosis ?
Parsing [sent. 4393 len. 26]: It is just one of those few cases in which one would like to have the authority of the Catholic priests to urge confession with .
Parsing [sent. 4394 len. 47]: I do not think anything will save her life , as we say , but you have taught some of us to think of the life that belongs to the spirit as THE life ; and I do believe confession would do everything for that . ''
Parsing [sent. 4395 len. 8]: `` Yes , if made to God .
Parsing [sent. 4396 len. 31]: But I will grant that communication of one 's sorrows or even sins to a wise brother of mankind may help to a deeper confession to the Father in heaven .
Parsing [sent. 4397 len. 11]: But I have no wish for AUTHORITY in the matter .
Parsing [sent. 4398 len. 32]: Let us see whether the Spirit of God working in her may not be quite as powerful for a final illumination of her being as the fiat confessio of a priest .
Parsing [sent. 4399 len. 13]: I have no confidence in FORCING in the moral or spiritual garden .
Parsing [sent. 4400 len. 23]: A hothouse development must necessarily be a sickly one , rendering the plant unfit for the normal life of the open air .
Parsing [sent. 4401 len. 2]: Wait .
Parsing [sent. 4402 len. 6]: We must not hurry things .
Parsing [sent. 4403 len. 11]: She will perhaps come to me of herself before long .
Parsing [sent. 4404 len. 10]: But I will call and inquire after her . ''
Parsing [sent. 4405 len. 14]: We parted ; and I went at once to Catherine Weir 's shop .
Parsing [sent. 4406 len. 17]: She received me much as usual , which was hardly to be called receiving at all .
Parsing [sent. 4407 len. 19]: Perhaps there was a doubtful shadow , not of more cordiality , but of less repulsion in it .
Parsing [sent. 4408 len. 48]: Her eyes were full of a stony brilliance , and the flame of the fire that was consuming her glowed upon her cheeks more brightly , I thought , than ever ; but that might be fancy , occasioned by what the doctor had said about her .
Parsing [sent. 4409 len. 11]: Her hand trembled , but her demeanour was perfectly calm .
Parsing [sent. 4410 len. 17]: `` I am sorry to hear you are complaining , Miss Weir , '' I said .
Parsing [sent. 4411 len. 11]: `` I suppose Dr Duncan told you so , sir .
Parsing [sent. 4412 len. 6]: But I am quite well .
Parsing [sent. 4413 len. 7]: I did not send for him .
Parsing [sent. 4414 len. 15]: He called of himself , and wanted to persuade me I was ill . ''
Parsing [sent. 4415 len. 10]: I understood that she felt injured by his interference .
Parsing [sent. 4416 len. 10]: `` You should attend to his advice , though .
Parsing [sent. 4417 len. 19]: He is a prudent man , and not in the least given to alarming people without cause . ''
Parsing [sent. 4418 len. 5]: She returned no answer .
Parsing [sent. 4419 len. 6]: So I tried another subject .
Parsing [sent. 4420 len. 10]: `` What a fine fellow your brother is ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4421 len. 9]: `` Yes ; he grows very much . ''
Parsing [sent. 4422 len. 12]: `` Has your father found another place for him yet ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4423 len. 6]: `` I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 4424 len. 12]: My father never tells me about any of his doings . ''
Parsing [sent. 4425 len. 14]: `` But do n't you go and talk to him , sometimes ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4426 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 4427 len. 9]: He does not care to see me . ''
Parsing [sent. 4428 len. 14]: `` I am going there now : will you come with me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4429 len. 4]: `` Thank you .
Parsing [sent. 4430 len. 10]: I never go where I am not wanted . ''
Parsing [sent. 4431 len. 16]: `` But it is not right that father and daughter should live as you do .
Parsing [sent. 4432 len. 24]: Suppose he may not have been so kind to you as he ought , you should not cherish resentment against him for it .
Parsing [sent. 4433 len. 10]: That only makes matters worse , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 4434 len. 16]: `` I never said to human being that he had been unkind to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 4435 len. 14]: `` And yet you let every person in the village know it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4436 len. 4]: `` How ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4437 len. 9]: Her eye had no longer the stony glitter .
Parsing [sent. 4438 len. 4]: It flashed now .
Parsing [sent. 4439 len. 7]: `` You are never seen together .
Parsing [sent. 4440 len. 7]: You scarcely speak when you meet .
Parsing [sent. 4441 len. 10]: Neither of you crosses the other 's threshold . ''
Parsing [sent. 4442 len. 8]: `` It is not my fault . ''
Parsing [sent. 4443 len. 11]: `` It is not ALL your fault , I know .
Parsing [sent. 4444 len. 67]: But do you think you can go to a heaven at last where you will be able to keep apart from each other , he in his house and you in your house , without any sign that it was through this father on earth that you were born into the world which the Father in heaven redeemed by the gift of His own Son ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4445 len. 14]: She was silent ; and , after a pause , I went on .
Parsing [sent. 4446 len. 14]: `` I believe , in my heart , that you love your father .
Parsing [sent. 4447 len. 8]: I could not believe otherwise of you .
Parsing [sent. 4448 len. 15]: And you will never be happy till you have made it up with him .
Parsing [sent. 4449 len. 8]: Have you done him no wrong ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4450 len. 41]: At these words , her face turned white -- with anger , I could see -- all but those spots on her cheek-bones , which shone out in dreadful contrast to the deathly paleness of the rest of her face .
Parsing [sent. 4451 len. 21]: Then the returning blood surged violently from her heart , and the red spots were lost in one crimson glow .
Parsing [sent. 4452 len. 28]: She opened her lips to speak , but apparently changing her mind , turned and walked haughtily out of the shop and closed the door behind her .
Parsing [sent. 4453 len. 27]: I waited , hoping she would recover herself and return ; but , after ten minutes had passed , I thought it better to go away .
Parsing [sent. 4454 len. 15]: As I had told her , I was going to her father 's shop .
Parsing [sent. 4455 len. 7]: There I was received very differently .
Parsing [sent. 4456 len. 35]: There was a certain softness in the manner of the carpenter which I had not observed before , with the same heartiness in the shake of his hand which had accompanied my last leave-taking .
Parsing [sent. 4457 len. 27]: I had purposely allowed ten days to elapse before I called again , to give time for the unpleasant feelings associated with my interference to vanish .
Parsing [sent. 4458 len. 12]: And now I had something in my mind about young Tom .
Parsing [sent. 4459 len. 13]: `` Have you got anything for your boy yet , Thomas ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4460 len. 6]: `` Not yet , sir .
Parsing [sent. 4461 len. 5]: There 's time enough .
Parsing [sent. 4462 len. 11]: I do n't want to part with him just yet .
Parsing [sent. 4463 len. 12]: There he is , taking his turn at what 's going .
Parsing [sent. 4464 len. 3]: Tom ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4465 len. 33]: And from the farther end of the large shop , where I had not observed him , now approached young Tom , in a canvas jacket , looking quite like a workman .
Parsing [sent. 4466 len. 19]: `` Well , Tom , I am glad to find you can turn your hand to anything . ''
Parsing [sent. 4467 len. 24]: `` I must be a stupid , sir , if I could n't handle my father 's tools , '' returned the lad .
Parsing [sent. 4468 len. 8]: `` I do n't know that quite .
Parsing [sent. 4469 len. 13]: I am not just prepared to admit it for my own sake .
Parsing [sent. 4470 len. 26]: My father is a lawyer , and I never could read a chapter in one of his books -- his tools , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 4471 len. 9]: `` Perhaps you never tried , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 4472 len. 24]: `` Indeed , I did ; and no doubt I could have done it if I had made up my mind to it .
Parsing [sent. 4473 len. 10]: But I never felt inclined to finish the page .
Parsing [sent. 4474 len. 9]: And that reminds me why I called to-day .
Parsing [sent. 4475 len. 13]: Thomas , I know that lad of yours is fond of reading .
Parsing [sent. 4476 len. 16]: Can you spare him from his work for an hour or so before breakfast ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4477 len. 6]: `` To-morrow , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4478 len. 22]: `` To-morrow , and to-morrow , and to-morrow , '' I answered ; `` and there 's Shakespeare for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4479 len. 46]: `` Of course , sir , whatever you wish , '' said Thomas , with a perplexed look , in which pleasure seemed to long for confirmation , and to be , till that came , afraid to put its `` native semblance on . ''
Parsing [sent. 4480 len. 12]: `` I want to give him some direction in his reading .
Parsing [sent. 4481 len. 27]: When a man is fond of any tools , and can use them , it is worth while showing him how to use them better . ''
Parsing [sent. 4482 len. 9]: `` Oh , thank you , sir ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4483 len. 9]: exclaimed Tom , his face beaming with delight .
Parsing [sent. 4484 len. 9]: `` That IS kind of you , sir !
Parsing [sent. 4485 len. 9]: Tom , you 're a made man ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4486 len. 4]: cried the father .
Parsing [sent. 4487 len. 46]: `` So , '' I went on , `` if you will let him come to me for an hour every morning , till he gets another place , say from eight to nine , I will see what I can do for him . ''
Parsing [sent. 4488 len. 17]: Tom 's face was as red with delight as his sister 's had been with anger .
Parsing [sent. 4489 len. 28]: And I left the shop somewhat consoled for the pain I had given Catherine , which grieved me without making me sorry that I had occasioned it .
Parsing [sent. 4490 len. 20]: I had intended to try to do something from the father 's side towards a reconciliation with his daughter .
Parsing [sent. 4491 len. 27]: But no sooner had I made up my proposal for Tom than I saw I had blocked up my own way towards my more important end .
Parsing [sent. 4492 len. 21]: For I could not bear to seem to offer to bribe him even to allow me to do him good .
Parsing [sent. 4493 len. 19]: Nor would he see that it was for his good and his daughter 's -- not at first .
Parsing [sent. 4494 len. 73]: The first impression would be that I had a PROFESSIONAL end to gain , that the reconciling of father and daughter was a sort of parish business of mine , and that I had smoothed the way to it by offering a gift -- an intellectual one , true , but not , therefore , the less a gift in the eyes of Thomas , who had a great respect for books .
Parsing [sent. 4495 len. 24]: This was just what would irritate such a man , and I resolved to say nothing about it , but bide my time .
Parsing [sent. 4496 len. 15]: When Tom came , I asked him if he had read any of Wordsworth .
Parsing [sent. 4497 len. 21]: For I always give people what I like myself , because that must be wherein I can best help them .
Parsing [sent. 4498 len. 15]: I was anxious , too , to find out what he was capable of .
Parsing [sent. 4499 len. 15]: And for this , anything that has more than a surface meaning will do .
Parsing [sent. 4500 len. 26]: I had no doubt about the lad 's intellect , and now I wanted to see what there was deeper than the intellect in him .
Parsing [sent. 4501 len. 6]: He said he had not .
Parsing [sent. 4502 len. 35]: I therefore chose one of Wordsworth 's sonnets , not one of his best by any means , but suitable for my purpose -- the one entitled , `` Composed during a Storm . ''
Parsing [sent. 4503 len. 33]: This I gave him to read , telling him to let me know when he considered that he had mastered the meaning of it , and sat down to my own studies .
Parsing [sent. 4504 len. 10]: I remember I was then reading the Anglo-Saxon Gospels .
Parsing [sent. 4505 len. 15]: I think it was fully half-an-hour before Tom rose and gently approached my place .
Parsing [sent. 4506 len. 30]: I had not been uneasy about the experiment after ten minutes had passed , and after that time was doubled , I felt certain of some measure of success .
Parsing [sent. 4507 len. 12]: This may possibly puzzle my reader ; but I will explain .
Parsing [sent. 4508 len. 39]: It was clear that Tom did not understand the sonnet at first ; and I was not in the least certain that he would come to understand it by any exertion of his intellect , without further experience .
Parsing [sent. 4509 len. 22]: But what I was delighted to be made sure of was that Tom at least knew that he did not know .
Parsing [sent. 4510 len. 10]: For that is the very next step to knowing .
Parsing [sent. 4511 len. 103]: Indeed , it may be said to be a more valuable gift than the other , being of general application ; for some quick people will understand many things very easily , but when they come to a thing that is beyond their present reach , will fancy they see a meaning in it , or invent one , or even -- which is far worse -- pronounce it nonsense ; and , indeed , show themselves capable of any device for getting out of the difficulty , except seeing and confessing to themselves that they are not able to understand it .
Parsing [sent. 4512 len. 35]: Possibly this sonnet might be beyond Tom now , but , at least , there was great hope that he saw , or believed , that there must be something beyond him in it .
Parsing [sent. 4513 len. 22]: I only hoped that he would not fall upon some wrong interpretation , seeing he was brooding over it so long .
Parsing [sent. 4514 len. 17]: `` Well , Tom , '' I said , `` have you made it out ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4515 len. 10]: `` I ca n't say I have , sir .
Parsing [sent. 4516 len. 14]: I 'm afraid I 'm very stupid , for I 've tried hard .
Parsing [sent. 4517 len. 12]: I must just ask you to tell me what it means .
Parsing [sent. 4518 len. 66]: But I must tell you one thing , sir : every time I read it over -- twenty times , I daresay -- I thought I was lying on my mother 's grave , as I lay that terrible night ; and then at the end there you were standing over me and saying , ` Can I do anything to help you ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 4519 len. 6]: I was struck with astonishment .
Parsing [sent. 4520 len. 29]: For here , in a wonderful manner , I saw the imagination outrunning the intellect , and manifesting to the heart what the brain could not yet understand .
Parsing [sent. 4521 len. 20]: It indicated undeveloped gifts of a far higher nature than those belonging to the mere power of understanding alone .
Parsing [sent. 4522 len. 32]: For there was a hidden sympathy of the deepest kind between the life experience of the lad , and the embodiment of such life experience on the part of the poet .
Parsing [sent. 4523 len. 37]: But he went on : `` I am sure , sir , I ought to have been at my prayers , then , but I was n't ; so I did n't deserve you to come .
Parsing [sent. 4524 len. 16]: But do n't you think God is sometimes better to us than we deserve ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4525 len. 20]: `` He is just everything to us , Tom ; and we do n't and ca n't deserve anything .
Parsing [sent. 4526 len. 12]: Now I will try to explain the sonnet to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4527 len. 67]: I had always had an impulse to teach ; not for the teaching 's sake , for that , regarded as the attempt to fill skulls with knowledge , had always been to me a desolate dreariness ; but the moment I saw a sign of hunger , an indication of readiness to receive , I was invariably seized with a kind of passion for giving .
Parsing [sent. 4528 len. 8]: I now proceeded to explain the sonnet .
Parsing [sent. 4529 len. 55]: Having done so , nearly as well as I could , Tom said : `` It is very strange , sir ; but now that I have heard you say what the poem means , I feel as if I had known it all the time , though I could not say it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4530 len. 8]: Here at least was no common mind .
Parsing [sent. 4531 len. 22]: The reader will not be surprised to hear that the hour before breakfast extended into two hours after breakfast as well .
Parsing [sent. 4532 len. 31]: Nor did this take up too much of my time , for the lad was capable of doing a great deal for himself under the sense of help at hand .
Parsing [sent. 4533 len. 18]: His father , so far from making any objection to the arrangement , was delighted with it .
Parsing [sent. 4534 len. 28]: Nor do I believe that the lad did less work in the shop for it : I learned that he worked regularly till eight o'clock every night .
Parsing [sent. 4535 len. 35]: Now the good of the arrangement was this : I had the lad fresh in the morning , clear-headed , with no mists from the valley of labour to cloud the heights of understanding .
Parsing [sent. 4536 len. 19]: From the exercise of the mind it was a pleasant and relieving change to turn to bodily exertion .
Parsing [sent. 4537 len. 18]: I am certain that he both thought and worked better , because he both thought and worked .
Parsing [sent. 4538 len. 17]: Every literary man ought to be MECHANICAL -LRB- to use a Shakespearean word -RRB- as well .
Parsing [sent. 4539 len. 23]: But it would have been quite a different matter , if he had come to me after the labour of the day .
Parsing [sent. 4540 len. 13]: He would not then have been able to think nearly so well .
Parsing [sent. 4541 len. 44]: But LABOUR , SLEEP , THOUGHT , LABOUR AGAIN , seems to me to be the right order with those who , earning their bread by the sweat of the brow , would yet remember that man shall not live by bread alone .
Parsing [sent. 4542 len. 38]: Were it possible that our mechanics could attend the institutions called by their name in the morning instead of the evening , perhaps we should not find them so ready to degenerate into places of mere amusement .
Parsing [sent. 4543 len. 21]: I am not objecting to the amusement ; only to cease to educate in order to amuse is to degenerate .
Parsing [sent. 4544 len. 46]: Amusement is a good and sacred thing ; but it is not on a par with education ; and , indeed , if it does not in any way further the growth of the higher nature , it can not be called good at all .
Parsing [sent. 4545 len. 74]: Having exercised him in the analysis of some of the best portions of our home literature , -- I mean helped him to take them to pieces , that , putting them together again , he might see what kind of things they were -- for who could understand a new machine , or find out what it was meant for , without either actually or in his mind taking it to pieces ?
Parsing [sent. 4546 len. 34]: -LRB- which pieces , however , let me remind my reader , are utterly useless , except in their relation to the whole -RRB- -- I resolved to try something fresh with him .
Parsing [sent. 4547 len. 42]: At this point I had intended to give my readers a theory of mine about the teaching and learning of a language ; and tell them how I had found the trial of it succeed in the case of Tom Weir .
Parsing [sent. 4548 len. 42]: But I think this would be too much of a digression from the course of my narrative , and would , besides , be interesting to those only who had given a good deal of thought to subjects belonging to education .
Parsing [sent. 4549 len. 67]: I will only say , therefore , that , by the end of three months , my pupil , without knowing any other Latin author , was able to read any part of the first book of the AEneid -- to read it tolerably in measure , and to enjoy the poetry of it -- and this not without a knowledge of the declensions and conjugations .
Parsing [sent. 4550 len. 14]: As to the syntax , I made the sentences themselves teach him that .
Parsing [sent. 4551 len. 70]: Now I know that , as an end , all this was of no great value ; but as a beginning , it was invaluable , for it made and KEPT him hungry for more ; whereas , in most modes of teaching , the beginnings are such that without the pressure of circumstances , no boy , especially after an interval of cessation , will return to them .
Parsing [sent. 4552 len. 30]: Such is not Nature 's mode , for the beginnings with her are as pleasant as the fruition , and that without being less thorough than they can be .
Parsing [sent. 4553 len. 21]: The knowledge a child gains of the external world is the foundation upon which all his future philosophy is built .
Parsing [sent. 4554 len. 49]: Every discovery he makes is fraught with pleasure -- that is the secret of his progress , and the essence of my theory : that learning should , in each individual case , as in the first case , be DISCOVERY -- bringing its own pleasure with it .
Parsing [sent. 4555 len. 12]: Nor is this to be confounded with turning study into play .
Parsing [sent. 4556 len. 58]: It is upon the moon itself that the infant speculates , after the moon itself -- that he stretches out his eager hands -- to find in after years that he still wants her , but that in science and poetry he has her a thousand-fold more than if she had been handed him down to suck .
Parsing [sent. 4557 len. 22]: So , after all , I have bored my reader with a shadow of my theory , instead of a description .
Parsing [sent. 4558 len. 23]: After all , again , the description would have plagued him more , and that must be both his and my comfort .
Parsing [sent. 4559 len. 19]: So through the whole of that summer and the following winter , I went on teaching Tom Weir .
Parsing [sent. 4560 len. 50]: He was a lad of uncommon ability , else he could not have effected what I say he had within his first three months of Latin , let my theory be not only perfect in itself , but true as well -- true to human nature , I mean .
Parsing [sent. 4561 len. 54]: And his father , though his own book-learning was but small , had enough of insight to perceive that his son was something out of the common , and that any possible advantage he might lose by remaining in Marshmallows was considerably more than counterbalanced by the instruction he got from the vicar .
Parsing [sent. 4562 len. 19]: Hence , I believe , it was that not a word was said about another situation for Tom .
Parsing [sent. 4563 len. 23]: And I was glad of it ; for it seemed to me that the lad had abilities equal to any profession whatever .
Parsing [sent. 4564 len. 3]: CHAPTER XV .
Parsing [sent. 4565 len. 5]: DR DUNCAN 'S STORY .
Parsing [sent. 4566 len. 40]: On the next Sunday but one -- which was surprising to me when I considered the manner of our last parting -- Catherine Weir was in church , for the second time since I had come to the place .
Parsing [sent. 4567 len. 132]: As it happened , only as Spenser says -- `` It chanced -- eternal God that chance did guide , '' -- and why I say this , will appear afterwards -- I had , in preaching upon , that is , in endeavouring to enforce the Lord 's Prayer by making them think about the meaning of the words they were so familiar with , come to the petition , `` Forgive us our debts , as we forgive our debtors ; '' with which I naturally connected the words of our Lord that follow : `` For if ye forgive men their trespasses , your heavenly Father will also forgive you ; but if ye forgive not men their trespasses , neither will your Father forgive your trespasses . ''
Parsing [sent. 4568 len. 93]: I need not tell my reader more of what I said about this , than that I tried to show that even were it possible with God to forgive an unforgiving man , the man himself would not be able to believe for a moment that God did forgive him , and therefore could get no comfort or help or joy of any kind from the forgiveness ; so essentially does hatred , or revenge , or contempt , or anything that separates us from man , separate us from God too .
Parsing [sent. 4569 len. 18]: To the loving soul alone does the Father reveal Himself ; for love alone can understand Him .
Parsing [sent. 4570 len. 9]: It is the peace-makers who are His children .
Parsing [sent. 4571 len. 15]: This I said , thinking of no one more than another of my audience .
Parsing [sent. 4572 len. 25]: But as I closed my sermon , I could not help fancying that Mrs Oldcastle looked at me with more than her usual fierceness .
Parsing [sent. 4573 len. 27]: I forgot all about it , however , for I never seemed to myself to have any hold of , or relation to , that woman .
Parsing [sent. 4574 len. 19]: I know I was wrong in being unable to feel my relation to her because I disliked her .
Parsing [sent. 4575 len. 24]: But not till years after did I begin to understand how she felt , or recognize in myself a common humanity with her .
Parsing [sent. 4576 len. 11]: A sin of my own made me understand her condition .
Parsing [sent. 4577 len. 15]: I can hardly explain now ; I will tell it when the time comes .
Parsing [sent. 4578 len. 30]: When I called upon her next , after the interview last related , she behaved much as if she had forgotten all about it , which was not likely .
Parsing [sent. 4579 len. 42]: In the end of the week after the sermon to which I have alluded , I was passing the Hall-gate on my usual Saturday 's walk , when Judy saw me from within , as she came out of the lodge .
Parsing [sent. 4580 len. 8]: She was with me in a moment .
Parsing [sent. 4581 len. 22]: `` Mr Walton , '' she said , `` how could you preach at Grannie as you did last Sunday ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4582 len. 11]: `` I did not preach at anybody , Judy . ''
Parsing [sent. 4583 len. 7]: `` Oh , Mr Walton ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4584 len. 9]: `` You know I did n't , Judy .
Parsing [sent. 4585 len. 16]: You know that if I had , I would not say I had not . ''
Parsing [sent. 4586 len. 16]: `` Yes , yes ; I know that perfectly , '' she said , seriously .
Parsing [sent. 4587 len. 8]: `` But Grannie thinks you did . ''
Parsing [sent. 4588 len. 8]: `` How do you know that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4589 len. 6]: `` By her face . ''
Parsing [sent. 4590 len. 9]: `` That is all , is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4591 len. 11]: `` You do n't think Grannie would say so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4592 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 4593 len. 15]: Nor yet that you could know by her face what she was thinking . ''
Parsing [sent. 4594 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 4595 len. 5]: ca n't I just ?
Parsing [sent. 4596 len. 31]: I can read her face -- not so well as plain print ; but , let me see , as well as what Uncle Stoddart calls black-letter , at least .
Parsing [sent. 4597 len. 24]: I know she thought you were preaching at her ; and her face said , ' I sha n't forgive YOU , anyhow .
Parsing [sent. 4598 len. 14]: I never forgive , and I wo n't for all your preaching . '
Parsing [sent. 4599 len. 8]: That 's what her face said . ''
Parsing [sent. 4600 len. 23]: `` I am sure she would not say so , Judy , '' I said , really not knowing what to say .
Parsing [sent. 4601 len. 11]: `` Oh , no ; she would not say so .
Parsing [sent. 4602 len. 15]: She would say , ' I always forgive , but I never forget . '
Parsing [sent. 4603 len. 9]: That 's a favourite saying of hers . ''
Parsing [sent. 4604 len. 42]: `` But , Judy , do n't you think it is rather hypocritical of you to say all this to me about your grandmother when she is so kind to you , and you seem such good friends with her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4605 len. 12]: She looked up in my face with an expression of surprise .
Parsing [sent. 4606 len. 13]: `` It is all TRUE , Mr Walton , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 4607 len. 3]: `` Perhaps .
Parsing [sent. 4608 len. 10]: But you are saying it behind her back . ''
Parsing [sent. 4609 len. 14]: `` I will go home and say it to her face directly . ''
Parsing [sent. 4610 len. 5]: She turned to go .
Parsing [sent. 4611 len. 7]: `` No , no , Judy .
Parsing [sent. 4612 len. 16]: I did not mean that , '' I said , taking her by the arm .
Parsing [sent. 4613 len. 12]: `` I wo n't say you told me to do it .
Parsing [sent. 4614 len. 10]: I thought there was no harm in telling you .
Parsing [sent. 4615 len. 13]: Grannie is kind to me , and I am kind to her .
Parsing [sent. 4616 len. 18]: But Grannie is afraid of my tongue , and I mean her to be afraid of it .
Parsing [sent. 4617 len. 11]: It 's the only way to keep her in order .
Parsing [sent. 4618 len. 4]: Darling Aunt Winnie !
Parsing [sent. 4619 len. 10]: it 's all she 's got to defend her .
Parsing [sent. 4620 len. 30]: If you knew how she treats her sometimes , you would be cross with Grannie yourself , Mr Walton , for all your goodness and your white surplice . ''
Parsing [sent. 4621 len. 39]: And to my yet greater surprise , the wayward girl burst out crying , and , breaking away from me , ran through the gate , and out of sight amongst the trees , without once looking back .
Parsing [sent. 4622 len. 30]: I pursued my walk , my meditations somewhat discomposed by the recurring question : -- Would she go home and tell her grandmother what she had said to me ?
Parsing [sent. 4623 len. 33]: And , if she did , would it not widen the breach upon the opposite side of which I seemed to see Ethelwyn stand , out of the reach of my help ?
Parsing [sent. 4624 len. 35]: I walked quickly on to reach a stile by means of which I should soon leave the little world of Marshmallows quite behind me , and be alone with nature and my Greek Testament .
Parsing [sent. 4625 len. 104]: Hearing the sound of horse-hoofs on the road from Addicehead , I glanced up from my pocket-book , in which I had been looking over the thoughts that had at various moments passed through my mind that week , in order to choose one -LRB- or more , if they would go together -RRB- to be brooded over to-day for my people 's spiritual diet to-morrow -- I say I glanced up from my pocket-book , and saw a young man , that is , if I could call myself young still , of distinguished appearance , approaching upon a good serviceable hack .
Parsing [sent. 4626 len. 9]: He turned into my road and passed me .
Parsing [sent. 4627 len. 41]: He was pale , with a dark moustache , and large dark eyes ; sat his horse well and carelessly ; had fine features of the type commonly considered Grecian , but thin , and expressive chiefly of conscious weariness .
Parsing [sent. 4628 len. 19]: He wore a white hat with crape upon it , white gloves , and long , military-looking boots .
Parsing [sent. 4629 len. 42]: All this I caught as he passed me ; and I remember them , because , looking after him , I saw him stop at the lodge of the Hall , ring the bell , and then ride through the gate .
Parsing [sent. 4630 len. 35]: I confess I did not quite like this ; but I got over the feeling so far as to be able to turn to my Testament when I had reached and crossed the stile .
Parsing [sent. 4631 len. 18]: I came home another way , after one of the most delightful days I had ever spent .
Parsing [sent. 4632 len. 49]: Having reached the river in the course of my wandering , I came down the side of it towards Old Rogers 's cottage , loitering and looking , quiet in heart and soul and mind , because I had committed my cares to Him who careth for us .
Parsing [sent. 4633 len. 28]: The earth was round me -- I was rooted , as it were , in it , but the air of a higher life was about me .
Parsing [sent. 4634 len. 50]: I was swayed to and fro by the motions of a spiritual power ; feelings and desires and hopes passed through me , passed away , and returned ; and still my head rose into the truth , and the will of God was the regnant sunlight upon it .
Parsing [sent. 4635 len. 100]: I might change my place and condition ; new feelings might come forth , and old feelings retire into the lonely corners of my being ; but still my heart should be glad and strong in the one changeless thing , in the truth that maketh free ; still my head should rise into the sunlight of God , and I should know that because He lived I should live also , and because He was true I should remain true also , nor should any change pass upon me that should make me mourn the decadence of humanity .
Parsing [sent. 4636 len. 48]: And then I found that I was gazing over the stump of an old pollard , on which I was leaning , down on a great bed of white water-lilies , that lay in the broad slow river , here broader and slower than in most places .
Parsing [sent. 4637 len. 44]: The slanting yellow sunlight shone through the water down to the very roots anchored in the soil , and the water swathed their stems with coolness and freshness , and a universal sense , I doubt not , of watery presence and nurture .
Parsing [sent. 4638 len. 59]: And there on their lovely heads , as they lay on the pillow of the water , shone the life-giving light of the summer sun , filling all the spaces between their outspread petals of living silver with its sea of radiance , and making them gleam with the whiteness which was born of them and the sun .
Parsing [sent. 4639 len. 48]: And then came a hand on my shoulder , and , turning , I saw the gray head and the white smock of my old friend Rogers , and I was glad that he loved me enough not to be afraid of the parson and the gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 4640 len. 74]: `` I 've found it , sir , I do think , '' he said , his brown furrowed old face shining with a yet lovelier light than that which shone from the blossoms of the water-lilies , though , after what I had been thinking about them , it was no wonder that they seemed both to mean the same thing , -- both to shine in the light of His countenance .
Parsing [sent. 4641 len. 8]: `` Found what , Old Rogers ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4642 len. 16]: I returned , raising myself , and laying my hand in return on his shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 4643 len. 28]: `` Why He was displeased with the disciples for not knowing -- '' `` What He meant about the leaven of the Pharisees , '' I interrupted .
Parsing [sent. 4644 len. 8]: `` Yes , yes , of course .
Parsing [sent. 4645 len. 5]: Tell me then . ''
Parsing [sent. 4646 len. 7]: `` I will try , sir .
Parsing [sent. 4647 len. 9]: It was all dark to me for days .
Parsing [sent. 4648 len. 48]: For it appeared to me very nat ` ral that , seeing they had no bread in the locker , and hearing tell of leaven which they were n't to eat , they should think it had summat to do with their having none of any sort .
Parsing [sent. 4649 len. 18]: But He did n't seem to think it was right of them to fall into the blunder .
Parsing [sent. 4650 len. 4]: For why then ?
Parsing [sent. 4651 len. 8]: A man ca n't be always right .
Parsing [sent. 4652 len. 43]: He may be like myself , a foremast-man with no schoolin ' but what the winds and the waves puts into him , and I 'm thinkin ' those fishermen the Lord took to so much were something o ' that sort .
Parsing [sent. 4653 len. 8]: ` How could they help it ? '
Parsing [sent. 4654 len. 7]: I said to myself , sir .
Parsing [sent. 4655 len. 17]: And from that I came to ask myself , ` Could they have helped it ? '
Parsing [sent. 4656 len. 14]: If they could n't , He would n't have been vexed with them .
Parsing [sent. 4657 len. 12]: Mayhap they ought to ha ' been able to help it .
Parsing [sent. 4658 len. 16]: And all at once , sir , this mornin ' , it came to me .
Parsing [sent. 4659 len. 15]: I do n't know how , but it was give to me , anyhow .
Parsing [sent. 4660 len. 34]: And I flung down my rake , and I ran in to the old woman , but she was n't in the way , and so I went back to my work again .
Parsing [sent. 4661 len. 39]: But when I saw you , sir , a readin ' upon the lilies o ' the field , leastways , the lilies o ' the water , I could n't help runnin ' out to tell you .
Parsing [sent. 4662 len. 24]: Is n't it a satisfaction , sir , when yer dead reckonin ' runs ye right in betwixt the cheeks of the harbour ?
Parsing [sent. 4663 len. 7]: I see it all now . ''
Parsing [sent. 4664 len. 11]: `` Well , I want to know , old Rogers .
Parsing [sent. 4665 len. 43]: I 'm not so old as you , and so I MAY live longer ; and every time I read that passage , I should like to be able to say to myself , ` Old Rogers gave me this . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 4666 len. 10]: `` I only hope I 'm right , sir .
Parsing [sent. 4667 len. 24]: It was just this : their heads was full of their dinner because they did n't know where it was to come from .
Parsing [sent. 4668 len. 13]: But they ought to ha ' known where it always come from .
Parsing [sent. 4669 len. 33]: If their hearts had been full of the dinner He gave the five thousand hungry men and women and children , they would n't have been uncomfortable about not having a loaf .
Parsing [sent. 4670 len. 36]: And so they would n't have been set upon the wrong tack when He spoke about the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees ; and they would have known in a moment what He meant .
Parsing [sent. 4671 len. 41]: And if I had n't been too much of the same sort , I would n't have started saying it was but reasonable to be in the doldrums because they were at sea with no biscuit in the locker . ''
Parsing [sent. 4672 len. 13]: `` You 're right ; you must be right , old Rogers .
Parsing [sent. 4673 len. 19]: It 's as plain as possible , '' I cried , rejoiced at the old man 's insight .
Parsing [sent. 4674 len. 4]: `` Thank you .
Parsing [sent. 4675 len. 7]: I 'll preach about it to-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 4676 len. 22]: I thought I had got my sermon in Foxborough Wood , but I was mistaken : you had got it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4677 len. 6]: But I was mistaken again .
Parsing [sent. 4678 len. 8]: I had not got my sermon yet .
Parsing [sent. 4679 len. 21]: I walked with him to his cottage and left him , after a greeting with the `` old woman . ''
Parsing [sent. 4680 len. 27]: Passing then through the village , and seeing by the light of her candle the form of Catherine Weir behind her counter , I went in .
Parsing [sent. 4681 len. 19]: I thought old Rogers 's tobacco must be nearly gone , and I might safely buy some more .
Parsing [sent. 4682 len. 10]: Catherine 's manner was much the same as usual .
Parsing [sent. 4683 len. 28]: But as she was weighing my purchase , she broke out all at once : `` It 's no use your preaching at me , Mr Walton .
Parsing [sent. 4684 len. 9]: I can not , I WILL not forgive .
Parsing [sent. 4685 len. 7]: I will do anything BUT forgive .
Parsing [sent. 4686 len. 7]: And it 's no use . ''
Parsing [sent. 4687 len. 11]: `` It is not I that say it , Catherine .
Parsing [sent. 4688 len. 7]: It is the Lord himself . ''
Parsing [sent. 4689 len. 27]: I saw no great use in protesting my innocence , yet I thought it better to add -- `` And I was not preaching AT you .
Parsing [sent. 4690 len. 19]: I was preaching to you , as much as to any one there , and no more . ''
Parsing [sent. 4691 len. 25]: Of this she took no notice , and I resumed : `` Just think of what HE says ; not what I say . ''
Parsing [sent. 4692 len. 7]: `` I ca n't help it .
Parsing [sent. 4693 len. 13]: If He wo n't forgive me , I must go without it .
Parsing [sent. 4694 len. 6]: I ca n't forgive . ''
Parsing [sent. 4695 len. 27]: I saw that good and evil were fighting in her , and felt that no words of mine could be of further avail at the moment .
Parsing [sent. 4696 len. 18]: The words of our Lord had laid hold of her ; that was enough for this time .
Parsing [sent. 4697 len. 8]: Nor dared I ask her any questions .
Parsing [sent. 4698 len. 12]: I had the feeling that it would hurt , not help .
Parsing [sent. 4699 len. 20]: All I could venture to say , was : `` I wo n't trouble you with talk , Catherine .
Parsing [sent. 4700 len. 8]: Our Lord wants to talk to you .
Parsing [sent. 4701 len. 8]: It is not for me to interfere .
Parsing [sent. 4702 len. 26]: But please to remember , if ever you think I can serve you in any way , you have only to send for me . ''
Parsing [sent. 4703 len. 12]: She murmured a mechanical thanks , and handed me my parcel .
Parsing [sent. 4704 len. 15]: I paid for it , bade her good night , and left the shop .
Parsing [sent. 4705 len. 26]: `` O Lord , '' I said in my heart , as I walked away , `` what a labour Thou hast with us all !
Parsing [sent. 4706 len. 17]: Shall we ever , some day , be all , and quite , good like Thee ?
Parsing [sent. 4707 len. 3]: Help me .
Parsing [sent. 4708 len. 35]: Fill me with Thy light , that my work may all go to bring about the gladness of Thy kingdom -- the holy household of us brothers and sisters -- all Thy children . ''
Parsing [sent. 4709 len. 16]: And now I found that I wanted very much to see my friend Dr Duncan .
Parsing [sent. 4710 len. 21]: He received me with his stately cordiality , and a smile that went farther than all his words of greeting .
Parsing [sent. 4711 len. 24]: `` Come now , Mr Walton , I am just going to sit down to my dinner , and you must join me .
Parsing [sent. 4712 len. 10]: I think there will be enough for us both .
Parsing [sent. 4713 len. 29]: There is , I believe , a chicken a-piece for us , and we can make up with cheese and a glass of -- would you believe it ?
Parsing [sent. 4714 len. 7]: -- my own father 's port .
Parsing [sent. 4715 len. 25]: He was fond of port -- the old man -- though I never saw him with one glass more aboard than the registered tonnage .
Parsing [sent. 4716 len. 8]: He always sat light on the water .
Parsing [sent. 4717 len. 5]: Ah , dear me !
Parsing [sent. 4718 len. 7]: I 'm old myself now . ''
Parsing [sent. 4719 len. 12]: `` But what am I to do with Mrs Pearson ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4720 len. 3]: I said .
Parsing [sent. 4721 len. 14]: `` There 's some chef-d'oeuvre of hers waiting for me by this time .
Parsing [sent. 4722 len. 12]: She always treats me particularly well on Saturdays and Sundays . ''
Parsing [sent. 4723 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 4724 len. 9]: then , you must not stop with me .
Parsing [sent. 4725 len. 8]: You will fare better at home . ''
Parsing [sent. 4726 len. 10]: `` But I should much prefer stopping with you .
Parsing [sent. 4727 len. 10]: Could n't you send a message for me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4728 len. 5]: `` To be sure .
Parsing [sent. 4729 len. 10]: My boy will run with it at once . ''
Parsing [sent. 4730 len. 11]: Now , what is the use of writing all this ?
Parsing [sent. 4731 len. 5]: I do not know .
Parsing [sent. 4732 len. 53]: Only that even a tete-a-tete dinner with an old friend , now that I am an old man myself , has such a pearly halo about it in the mists of the past , that every little circumstance connected with it becomes interesting , though it may be quite unworthy of record .
Parsing [sent. 4733 len. 9]: So , kind reader , let it stand .
Parsing [sent. 4734 len. 20]: We sat down to our dinner , so simple and so well-cooked that it was just what I liked .
Parsing [sent. 4735 len. 67]: I wanted very much to tell my friend what had occurred in Catherine 's shop , but I would not begin till we were safe from interruption ; and so we chatted away concerning many things , he telling me about his seafaring life , and I telling him some of the few remarkable things that had happened to me in the course of my life-voyage .
Parsing [sent. 4736 len. 40]: There is no man but has met with some remarkable things that other people would like to know , and which would seem stranger to them than they did at the time to the person to whom they happened .
Parsing [sent. 4737 len. 14]: At length I brought our conversation round to my interview with Catherine Weir .
Parsing [sent. 4738 len. 23]: `` Can you understand , '' I said , `` a woman finding it so hard to forgive her own father ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4739 len. 10]: `` Are you sure it is her father ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4740 len. 3]: he returned .
Parsing [sent. 4741 len. 12]: `` Surely she has not this feeling towards more than one .
Parsing [sent. 4742 len. 12]: That she has it towards her father , I know . ''
Parsing [sent. 4743 len. 10]: `` I do n't know , '' he answered .
Parsing [sent. 4744 len. 21]: `` I have known resentment preponderate over every other feeling and passion -- in the mind of a woman too .
Parsing [sent. 4745 len. 27]: I once heard of a good woman who cherished this feeling against a good man because of some distrustful words he had once addressed to herself .
Parsing [sent. 4746 len. 31]: She had lived to a great age , and was expressing to her clergyman her desire that God would take her away : she had been waiting a long time .
Parsing [sent. 4747 len. 40]: The clergyman -- a very shrewd as well as devout man , and not without a touch of humour , said : ` Perhaps God does n't mean to let you die till you 've forgiven Mr -- . '
Parsing [sent. 4748 len. 45]: She was as if struck with a flash of thought , sat silent during the rest of his visit , and when the clergyman called the next day , he found Mr -- and her talking together very quietly over a cup of tea .
Parsing [sent. 4749 len. 35]: And she had n't long to wait after that , I was told , but was gathered to her fathers -- or went home to her children , whichever is the better phrase . ''
Parsing [sent. 4750 len. 16]: `` I wish I had had your experience , Dr Duncan , '' I said .
Parsing [sent. 4751 len. 22]: `` I have not had so much experience as a general practitioner , because I have been so long at sea .
Parsing [sent. 4752 len. 43]: But I am satisfied that until a medical man knows a good deal more about his patient than most medical men give themselves the trouble to find out , his prescriptions will partake a good deal more than is necessary of haphazard .
Parsing [sent. 4753 len. 36]: -- As to this question of obstinate resentment , I know one case in which it is the ruling presence of a woman 's life -- the very light that is in her is resentment .
Parsing [sent. 4754 len. 6]: I think her possessed myself .
Parsing [sent. 4755 len. 8]: `` Tell me something about her . ''
Parsing [sent. 4756 len. 4]: `` I will .
Parsing [sent. 4757 len. 10]: But even to you I will mention no names .
Parsing [sent. 4758 len. 10]: Not that I have her confidence in the least .
Parsing [sent. 4759 len. 8]: But I think it is better not .
Parsing [sent. 4760 len. 18]: I was called to attend a lady at a house where I had never yet been . ''
Parsing [sent. 4761 len. 7]: `` Was it in -- ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4762 len. 7]: I began , but checked myself .
Parsing [sent. 4763 len. 9]: Dr Duncan smiled and went on without remark .
Parsing [sent. 4764 len. 33]: I could see that he told his story with great care , lest , I thought , he should let anything slip that might give a clue to the place or people .
Parsing [sent. 4765 len. 12]: `` I was led up into an old-fashioned , richly-furnished room .
Parsing [sent. 4766 len. 8]: A great wood-fire burned on the hearth .
Parsing [sent. 4767 len. 21]: The bed was surrounded with heavy dark curtains , in which the shadowy remains of bright colours were just visible .
Parsing [sent. 4768 len. 15]: In the bed lay one of the loveliest young creatures I had ever seen .
Parsing [sent. 4769 len. 19]: And , one on each side , stood two of the most dreadful-looking women I had ever beheld .
Parsing [sent. 4770 len. 24]: Still as death , while I examined my patient , they stood , with moveless faces , one as white as the other .
Parsing [sent. 4771 len. 10]: Only the eyes of both of them were alive .
Parsing [sent. 4772 len. 10]: One was evidently mistress , and the other servant .
Parsing [sent. 4773 len. 17]: The latter looked more self-contained than the former , but less determined and possibly more cruel .
Parsing [sent. 4774 len. 12]: That both could be unkind at least , was plain enough .
Parsing [sent. 4775 len. 15]: There was trouble and signs of inward conflict in the eyes of the mistress .
Parsing [sent. 4776 len. 19]: The maid gave no sign of any inside to her at all , but stood watching her mistress .
Parsing [sent. 4777 len. 14]: A child 's toy was lying in a corner of the room . ''
Parsing [sent. 4778 len. 32]: I may here interrupt my friend 's story to tell my reader that I may be mingling some of my own conclusions with what the good man told me of his .
Parsing [sent. 4779 len. 53]: For he will see well enough already that I had in a moment attached his description to persons I knew , and , as it turned out , correctly , though I could not be certain about it till the story had advanced a little beyond this early stage of its progress .
Parsing [sent. 4780 len. 39]: `` I found the lady very weak and very feverish -- a quick feeble pulse , now bounding , and now intermitting -- and a restlessness in her eye which I felt contained the secret of her disorder .
Parsing [sent. 4781 len. 46]: She kept glancing , as if involuntarily , towards the door , which would not open for all her looking , and I heard her once murmur to herself -- for I was still quick of hearing then -- ` He wo n't come ! '
Parsing [sent. 4782 len. 28]: Perhaps I only saw her lips move to those words -- I can not be sure , but I am certain she said them in her heart .
Parsing [sent. 4783 len. 19]: I prescribed for her as far as I could venture , but begged a word with her mother .
Parsing [sent. 4784 len. 10]: She went with me into an adjoining room . ''
Parsing [sent. 4785 len. 24]: ` The lady is longing for something , ' I said , not wishing to be so definite as I could have been .
Parsing [sent. 4786 len. 7]: `` The mother made no reply .
Parsing [sent. 4787 len. 11]: I saw her lips shut yet closer than before . ''
Parsing [sent. 4788 len. 12]: ` She is your daughter , is she not ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 4789 len. 9]: ` Yes , ' -- very decidedly . ''
Parsing [sent. 4790 len. 12]: ` Could you not find out what she wishes ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 4791 len. 9]: ` Perhaps I could guess . ' '' '
Parsing [sent. 4792 len. 19]: I do not think I can do her any good till she has what she wants . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 4793 len. 11]: ` Is that your mode of prescribing , doctor ? '
Parsing [sent. 4794 len. 6]: she said , tartly . ''
Parsing [sent. 4795 len. 15]: ` Yes , certainly , ' I answered -- ` in the present case .
Parsing [sent. 4796 len. 6]: Is she married ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 4797 len. 5]: ` Yes . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 4798 len. 8]: ` Has she any children ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 4799 len. 6]: ` One daughter . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 4800 len. 10]: ` Let her see her , then . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 4801 len. 11]: ` She does not care to see her . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 4802 len. 8]: ` Where is her husband ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 4803 len. 23]: ` Excuse me , doctor ; I did not send for you to ask questions , but to give advice . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 4804 len. 16]: ` And I came to ask questions , in order that I might give advice .
Parsing [sent. 4805 len. 27]: Do you think a human being is like a clock , that can be taken to pieces , cleaned , and put together again ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 4806 len. 15]: ` My daughter 's condition is not a fit subject for jesting . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 4807 len. 4]: ` Certainly not .
Parsing [sent. 4808 len. 79]: Send for her husband , or the undertaker , whichever you please , ' I said , forgetting my manners and my temper together , for I was more irritable then than I am now , and there was something so repulsive about the woman , that I felt as if I was talking to an evil creature that for her own ends , though what I could not tell , was tormenting the dying lady . '' '
Parsing [sent. 4809 len. 15]: I understood you were a GENTLEMAN -- of experience and breeding . ' '' '
Parsing [sent. 4810 len. 9]: I am not in the question , madam .
Parsing [sent. 4811 len. 7]: It is your daughter . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 4812 len. 9]: ` She shall take your prescription . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 4813 len. 13]: ` She must see her husband if it be possible . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 4814 len. 8]: ` It is not possible . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 4815 len. 6]: ` Why ? ' '' '
Parsing [sent. 4816 len. 12]: I say it is not possible , and that is enough .
Parsing [sent. 4817 len. 4]: Good morning . '
Parsing [sent. 4818 len. 10]: `` I could say no more at that time .
Parsing [sent. 4819 len. 6]: I called the next day .
Parsing [sent. 4820 len. 30]: She was just the same , only that I knew she wanted to speak to me , and dared not , because of the presence of the two women .
Parsing [sent. 4821 len. 22]: Her troubled eyes seemed searching mine for pity and help , and I could not tell what to do for her .
Parsing [sent. 4822 len. 24]: There are , indeed , as some one says , strongholds of injustice and wrong into which no law can enter to help .
Parsing [sent. 4823 len. 86]: `` One afternoon , about a week after my first visit , I was sitting by her bedside , wondering what could be done to get her out of the clutches of these tormentors , who were , evidently to me , consuming her in the slow fire of her own affections , when I heard a faint noise , a rapid foot in the house so quiet before ; heard doors open and shut , then a dull sound of conflict of some sort .
Parsing [sent. 4824 len. 9]: Presently a quick step came up the oak-stair .
Parsing [sent. 4825 len. 21]: The face of my patient flushed , and her eyes gleamed as if her soul would come out of them .
Parsing [sent. 4826 len. 30]: Weak as she was she sat up in bed , almost without an effort , and the two women darted from the room , one after the other . ''
Parsing [sent. 4827 len. 5]: ` My husband ! '
Parsing [sent. 4828 len. 26]: said the girl -- for indeed she was little more in age , turning her face , almost distorted with eagerness , towards me . ''
Parsing [sent. 4829 len. 14]: ` Yes , my dear , ' I said , ' I know .
Parsing [sent. 4830 len. 17]: But you must be as still as you can , else you will be very ill .
Parsing [sent. 4831 len. 7]: Do keep quiet . ' '' '
Parsing [sent. 4832 len. 32]: I will , I will , ' she gasped , stuffing her pocket-handkerchief actually into her mouth to prevent herself from screaming , as if that was what would hurt her .
Parsing [sent. 4833 len. 6]: ` But go to him .
Parsing [sent. 4834 len. 6]: They will murder him . '
Parsing [sent. 4835 len. 101]: `` That moment I heard a cry , and what sounded like an articulate imprecation , but both from a woman 's voice ; and the next , a young man -- as fine a fellow as I ever saw -- dressed like a game-keeper , but evidently a gentleman , walked into the room with a quietness that strangely contrasted with the dreadful paleness of his face and with his disordered hair ; while the two women followed , as red as he was white , and evidently in fierce wrath from a fruitless struggle with the powerful youth .
Parsing [sent. 4836 len. 45]: He walked gently up to his wife , whose outstretched arms and face followed his face as he came round the bed to where she was at the other side , till arms , and face , and head , fell into his embrace .
Parsing [sent. 4837 len. 9]: `` I had gone to the mother . ''
Parsing [sent. 4838 len. 23]: ` Let us have no scene now , ' I said , ` or her blood will be on your head . '
Parsing [sent. 4839 len. 22]: `` She took no notice of what I said , but stood silently glaring , not gazing , at the pair .
Parsing [sent. 4840 len. 43]: I feared an outburst , and had resolved , if it came , to carry her at once from the room , which I was quite able to do then , Mr Walton , though I do n't look like it now .
Parsing [sent. 4841 len. 29]: But in a moment more the young man , becoming uneasy at the motionlessness of his wife , lifted up her head , and glanced in her face .
Parsing [sent. 4842 len. 25]: Seeing the look of terror in his , I hastened to him , and lifting her from him , laid her down -- dead .
Parsing [sent. 4843 len. 8]: Disease of the heart , I believe .
Parsing [sent. 4844 len. 23]: The mother burst into a shriek -- not of horror , or grief , or remorse , but of deadly hatred . ''
Parsing [sent. 4845 len. 7]: ` Look at your work ! '
Parsing [sent. 4846 len. 18]: she cried to him , as he stood gazing in stupor on the face of the girl .
Parsing [sent. 4847 len. 13]: ` You said she was yours , not mine ; take her .
Parsing [sent. 4848 len. 12]: You may have her now you have killed her . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 4849 len. 38]: ` He may have killed her ; but you have MURDERED her , madam , ' I said , as I took the man by the arm , and led him away , yielding like a child .
Parsing [sent. 4850 len. 38]: But the moment I got him out of the house , he gave a groan , and , breaking away from me , rushed down a road leading from the back of the house towards the home-farm .
Parsing [sent. 4851 len. 8]: I followed , but he had disappeared .
Parsing [sent. 4852 len. 33]: I went on ; but before I could reach the farm , I heard the gallop of a horse , and saw him tearing away at full speed along the London road .
Parsing [sent. 4853 len. 12]: I never heard more of him , or of the story .
Parsing [sent. 4854 len. 12]: Some women can be secret enough , I assure you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4855 len. 10]: I need not follow the rest of our conversation .
Parsing [sent. 4856 len. 12]: I could hardly doubt whose was the story I had heard .
Parsing [sent. 4857 len. 14]: It threw a light upon several things about which I had been perplexed .
Parsing [sent. 4858 len. 12]: What a horror of darkness seemed to hang over that family !
Parsing [sent. 4859 len. 5]: What deeds of wickedness !
Parsing [sent. 4860 len. 26]: But the reason was clear : the horror came from within ; selfishness , and fierceness of temper were its source -- no unhappy DOOM .
Parsing [sent. 4861 len. 37]: The worship of one 's own will fumes out around the being an atmosphere of evil , an altogether abnormal condition of the moral firmament , out of which will break the very flames of hell .
Parsing [sent. 4862 len. 82]: The consciousness of birth and of breeding , instead of stirring up to deeds of gentleness and `` high emprise , '' becomes then but an incentive to violence and cruelty ; and things which seem as if they could not happen in a civilized country and a polished age , are proved as possible as ever where the heart is unloving , the feelings unrefined , self the centre , and God nowhere in the man or woman 's vision .
Parsing [sent. 4863 len. 25]: The terrible things that one reads in old histories , or in modern newspapers , were done by human beings , not by demons .
Parsing [sent. 4864 len. 34]: I did not let my friend know that I knew all that he concealed ; but I may as well tell my reader now , what I could not have told him then .
Parsing [sent. 4865 len. 33]: I know all the story now , and , as no better place will come , as far as I can see , I will tell it at once , and briefly .
Parsing [sent. 4866 len. 49]: Dorothy -- a wonderful name , THE GIFT OF GOD , to be so treated , faring in this , however , like many other of God 's gifts -- Dorothy Oldcastle was the eldest daughter of Jeremy and Sibyl Oldcastle , and the sister therefore of Ethelwyn .
Parsing [sent. 4867 len. 128]: Her father , who was an easy-going man , entirely under the dominion of his wife , died when she was about fifteen , and her mother sent her to school , with especial recommendation to the care of a clergyman in the neighbourhood , whom Mrs Oldcastle knew ; for , somehow -- and the fact is not so unusual as to justify especial inquiry here -- though she paid no attention to what our Lord or His apostles said , nor indeed seemed to care to ask herself if what she did was right , or what she accepted -LRB- I can not say BELIEVED -RRB- was true , she had yet a certain -LRB- to me all but incomprehensible -RRB- leaning to the clergy .
Parsing [sent. 4868 len. 20]: I think it belongs to the same kind of superstition which many of our own day are turning to .
Parsing [sent. 4869 len. 61]: Offered the Spirit of God for the asking , offered it by the Lord himself , in the misery of their unbelief they betake themselves to necromancy instead , and raise the dead to ask their advice , AND FOLLOW IT , and will find some day that Satan had not forgotten how to dress like an angel of light .
Parsing [sent. 4870 len. 14]: Nay , he can be more cunning with the demands of the time .
Parsing [sent. 4871 len. 9]: We are clever : he will be cleverer .
Parsing [sent. 4872 len. 13]: Why should he dress and not speak like an angel of light ?
Parsing [sent. 4873 len. 24]: Why should he not give good advice if that will help to withdraw people by degrees from regarding the source of all good ?
Parsing [sent. 4874 len. 23]: He knows well enough that good advice goes for little , but that what fills the heart and mind goes for much .
Parsing [sent. 4875 len. 12]: What religion is there in being convinced of a future state ?
Parsing [sent. 4876 len. 6]: Is that to worship God ?
Parsing [sent. 4877 len. 17]: It is no more religion than the belief that the sun will rise to-morrow is religion .
Parsing [sent. 4878 len. 22]: It may be a source of happiness to those who could not believe it before , but it is not religion .
Parsing [sent. 4879 len. 17]: Where religion comes that will certainly be likewise , but the one is not the other .
Parsing [sent. 4880 len. 11]: The devil can afford a kind of conviction of that .
Parsing [sent. 4881 len. 5]: It costs him little .
Parsing [sent. 4882 len. 48]: But to believe that the spirits of the departed are the mediators between God and us is essential paganism -- to call it nothing worse ; and a bad enough name too since Christ has come and we have heard and seen the only-begotten of the Father .
Parsing [sent. 4883 len. 35]: Thus the instinctive desire for the wonderful , the need we have of a revelation from above us , denied its proper food and nourishment , turns in its hunger to feed upon garbage .
Parsing [sent. 4884 len. 24]: As a devout German says -- I do not quote him quite correctly -- `` Where God rules not , demons will . ''
Parsing [sent. 4885 len. 32]: Let us once see with our spiritual eyes the Wonderful , the Counsellor , and surely we shall not turn from Him to seek elsewhere the treasures of wisdom and knowledge .
Parsing [sent. 4886 len. 23]: Those who sympathize with my feeling in regard to this form of the materialism of our day , will forgive this divergence .
Parsing [sent. 4887 len. 18]: I submit to the artistic blame of such as do not , and return to my story .
Parsing [sent. 4888 len. 8]: Dorothy was there three or four years .
Parsing [sent. 4889 len. 7]: I said I would be brief .
Parsing [sent. 4890 len. 13]: She and the clergyman 's son fell in love with each other .
Parsing [sent. 4891 len. 12]: The mother heard of it , and sent for her home .
Parsing [sent. 4892 len. 7]: She had other views for her .
Parsing [sent. 4893 len. 26]: Of course , in such eyes , a daughter 's FANCY was , irrespective of its object altogether , a thing to be sneered at .
Parsing [sent. 4894 len. 35]: But she found , to her fierce disdain , that she had not been able to keep all her beloved obstinacy to herself : she had transmitted a portion of it to her daughter .
Parsing [sent. 4895 len. 40]: But in her it was combined with noble qualities , and , ceasing to be the evil thing it was in her mother , became an honourable firmness , rendering her able to withstand her mother 's stormy importunities .
Parsing [sent. 4896 len. 43]: Thus Nature had begun to right herself -- the right in the daughter turning to meet and defy the wrong in the mother , and that in the same strength of character which the mother had misused for evil and selfish ends .
Parsing [sent. 4897 len. 8]: And thus the bad breed was broken .
Parsing [sent. 4898 len. 10]: She was and would be true to her lover .
Parsing [sent. 4899 len. 6]: The consequent SCENES were dreadful .
Parsing [sent. 4900 len. 14]: The spirit but not the will of the girl was all but broken .
Parsing [sent. 4901 len. 11]: She felt that she could not sustain the strife long .
Parsing [sent. 4902 len. 17]: By some means , unknown to my informant , her lover contrived to communicate with her .
Parsing [sent. 4903 len. 29]: He had , through means of relations who had great influence with Government , procured a good appointment in India , whither he must sail within a month .
Parsing [sent. 4904 len. 11]: The end was that she left her mother 's house .
Parsing [sent. 4905 len. 30]: Mr Gladwyn was waiting for her near , and conducted her to his father 's , who had constantly refused to aid Mrs Oldcastle by interfering in the matter .
Parsing [sent. 4906 len. 13]: They were married next day by the clergyman of a neighbouring parish .
Parsing [sent. 4907 len. 39]: But almost immediately she was taken so ill , that it was impossible for her to accompany her husband , and she was compelled to remain behind at the rectory , hoping to join him the following year .
Parsing [sent. 4908 len. 40]: Before the time arrived , she gave birth to my little friend Judy ; and her departure was again delayed by a return of her old complaint , probably the early stages of the disease of which she died .
Parsing [sent. 4909 len. 61]: Then , just as she was about to set sail for India , news arrived that Mr Gladwyn had had a sunstroke , and would have leave of absence and come home as soon as he was able to be moved ; so that instead of going out to join him , she must wait for him where she was .
Parsing [sent. 4910 len. 9]: His mother had been dead for some time .
Parsing [sent. 4911 len. 39]: His father , an elderly man of indolent habits , was found dead in his chair one Sunday morning soon after the news had arrived of the illness of his son , to whom he was deeply attached .
Parsing [sent. 4912 len. 21]: And so the poor young creature was left alone with her child , without money , and in weak health .
Parsing [sent. 4913 len. 13]: The old man left nothing behind him but his furniture and books .
Parsing [sent. 4914 len. 29]: And nothing could be done in arranging his affairs till the arrival of his son , of whom the last accounts had been that he was slowly recovering .
Parsing [sent. 4915 len. 20]: In the meantime his wife was in want of money , without a friend to whom she could apply .
Parsing [sent. 4916 len. 62]: I presume that one of the few parishioners who visited at the rectory had written to acquaint Mrs Oldcastle with the condition in which her daughter was left , for , influenced by motives of which I dare not take upon me to conjecture an analysis , she wrote , offering her daughter all that she required in her old home .
Parsing [sent. 4917 len. 82]: Whether she fore-intended her following conduct , or old habit returned with the return of her daughter , I can not tell ; but she had not been more than a few days in the house before she began to tyrannise over her , as in old times , and although Mrs Gladwyn 's health , now always weak , was evidently failing in consequence , she either did not see the cause , or could not restrain her evil impulses .
Parsing [sent. 4918 len. 13]: At length the news arrived of Mr Gladwyn 's departure for home .
Parsing [sent. 4919 len. 34]: Perhaps then for the first time the temptation entered her mind to take her revenge upon him , by making her daughter 's illness a pretext for refusing him admission to her presence .
Parsing [sent. 4920 len. 56]: She told her she should not see him till she was better , for that it would make her worse ; persisted in her resolution after his arrival ; and effected , by the help of Sarah , that he should not gain admittance to the house , keeping all the doors locked except one .
Parsing [sent. 4921 len. 35]: It was only by the connivance of Ethelwyn , then a girl about fifteen , that he was admitted by the underground way , of which she unlocked the upper door for his entrance .
Parsing [sent. 4922 len. 25]: She had then guided him as far as she dared , and directed him the rest of the way to his wife 's room .
Parsing [sent. 4923 len. 63]: My reader will now understand how it came about in the process of writing these my recollections , that I have given such a long chapter chiefly to that one evening spent with my good friend , Dr Duncan ; for he will see , as I have said , that what he told me opened up a good deal to me .
Parsing [sent. 4924 len. 14]: I had very little time for the privacy of the church that night .
Parsing [sent. 4925 len. 27]: Dark as it was , however , I went in before I went home : I had the key of the vestry-door always in my pocket .
Parsing [sent. 4926 len. 18]: I groped my way into the pulpit , and sat down in the darkness , and thought .
Parsing [sent. 4927 len. 29]: Nor did my personal interest in Dr Duncan 's story make me forget poor Catherine Weir and the terrible sore in her heart , the sore of unforgivingness .
Parsing [sent. 4928 len. 46]: And I saw that of herself she would not , could not , forgive to all eternity ; that all the pains of hell could not make her forgive , for that it was a divine glory to forgive , and must come from God .
Parsing [sent. 4929 len. 79]: And thinking of Mrs Oldcastle , I saw that in ourselves we could be sure of no safety , not from the worst and vilest sins ; for who could tell how he might not stupify himself by degrees , and by one action after another , each a little worse than the former , till the very fires of Sinai would not flash into eyes blinded with the incense arising to the golden calf of his worship ?
Parsing [sent. 4930 len. 12]: A man may come to worship a devil without knowing it .
Parsing [sent. 4931 len. 49]: Only by being filled with a higher spirit than our own , which , having caused our spirits , is one with our spirits , and is in them the present life principle , are we or can we be safe from this eternal death of our being .
Parsing [sent. 4932 len. 24]: This spirit was fighting the evil spirit in Catherine Weir : how was I to urge her to give ear to the good ?
Parsing [sent. 4933 len. 64]: If will would but side with God , the forces of self , deserted by their leader , must soon quit the field ; and the woman -- the kingdom within her no longer torn by conflicting forces -- would sit quiet at the feet of the Master , reposing in that rest which He offered to those who could come to Him .
Parsing [sent. 4934 len. 15]: Might she not be roused to utter one feeble cry to God for help ?
Parsing [sent. 4935 len. 11]: That would be one step towards the forgiveness of others .
Parsing [sent. 4936 len. 18]: To ask something for herself would be a great advance in such a proud nature as hers .
Parsing [sent. 4937 len. 15]: And to ask good heartily is the very next step to giving good heartily .
Parsing [sent. 4938 len. 15]: Many thoughts such as these passed through my mind , chiefly associated with her .
Parsing [sent. 4939 len. 13]: For I could not think how to think about Mrs Oldcastle yet .
Parsing [sent. 4940 len. 11]: And the old church gloomed about me all the time .
Parsing [sent. 4941 len. 55]: And I kept lifting up my heart to the God who had cared to make me , and then drew me to be a preacher to my fellows , and had surely something to give me to say to them ; for did He not choose so to work by the foolishness of preaching ?
Parsing [sent. 4942 len. 19]: -- Might not my humble ignorance work His will , though my wrath could not work His righteousness ?
Parsing [sent. 4943 len. 18]: And I descended from the pulpit thinking with myself , `` Let Him do as He will .
Parsing [sent. 4944 len. 4]: Here I am .
Parsing [sent. 4945 len. 14]: I will say what I see : let Him make it good . ''
Parsing [sent. 4946 len. 50]: And the next morning , I spoke about the words of our Lord : `` If ye then , being evil , know how to give good gifts to your children , how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask Him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4947 len. 6]: And I looked to see .
Parsing [sent. 4948 len. 12]: And there Catherine Weir sat , looking me in the face .
Parsing [sent. 4949 len. 13]: There likewise sat Mrs Oldcastle , looking me in the face too .
Parsing [sent. 4950 len. 23]: And Judy sat there , also looking me in the face , as serious as man could wish grown woman to look .
Parsing [sent. 4951 len. 3]: CHAPTER XVI .
Parsing [sent. 4952 len. 3]: THE ORGAN .
Parsing [sent. 4953 len. 21]: One little matter I forgot to mention as having been talked about between Dr Duncan and myself that same evening .
Parsing [sent. 4954 len. 8]: I happened to refer to Old Rogers .
Parsing [sent. 4955 len. 10]: `` What a fine old fellow that is ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4956 len. 4]: said Dr Duncan .
Parsing [sent. 4957 len. 9]: `` Indeed he is , '' I answered .
Parsing [sent. 4958 len. 11]: `` He is a great comfort and help to me .
Parsing [sent. 4959 len. 19]: I do n't think anybody but myself has an idea what there is in that old man . ''
Parsing [sent. 4960 len. 17]: `` The people in the village do n't quite like him , though , I find .
Parsing [sent. 4961 len. 16]: He is too ready to be down upon them when he sees things going amiss .
Parsing [sent. 4962 len. 11]: The fact is , they are afraid of him . ''
Parsing [sent. 4963 len. 36]: `` Something as the Jews were afraid of John the Baptist , because he was an honest man , and spoke not merely his own mind , but the mind of God in it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4964 len. 4]: `` Just so .
Parsing [sent. 4965 len. 7]: I believe you 're quite right .
Parsing [sent. 4966 len. 38]: Do you know , the other day , happening to go into Weir 's shop to get him to do a job for me , I found him and Old Rogers at close quarters in an argument ?
Parsing [sent. 4967 len. 54]: I could not well understand the drift of it , not having been present at the beginning , but I soon saw that , keen as Weir was , and far surpassing Rogers in correctness of speech , and precision as well , the old sailor carried too heavy metal for the carpenter .
Parsing [sent. 4968 len. 47]: It evidently annoyed Weir ; but such was the good humour of Rogers , that he could not , for very shame , lose his temper , the old man 's smile again and again compelling a response on the thin cheeks of ihe other . ''
Parsing [sent. 4969 len. 13]: `` I know how he would talk exactly , '' I returned .
Parsing [sent. 4970 len. 32]: `` He has a kind of loving banter with him , if you will allow me the expression , that is irresistible to any man with a heart in his bosom .
Parsing [sent. 4971 len. 15]: I am very glad to hear there is anything like communion begun between them .
Parsing [sent. 4972 len. 8]: Weir will get good from him . ''
Parsing [sent. 4973 len. 9]: `` My man-of-all-work is going to leave me .
Parsing [sent. 4974 len. 12]: I wonder if the old man would take his place ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4975 len. 12]: `` I do not know whether he is fit for it .
Parsing [sent. 4976 len. 28]: But of one thing you may be sure -- if Old Rogers does not honestly believe he is fit for it , he will not take it .
Parsing [sent. 4977 len. 10]: And he will tell you why , too . ''
Parsing [sent. 4978 len. 17]: `` Of that , however , I think I may be a better judge than he .
Parsing [sent. 4979 len. 20]: There is nothing to which a good sailor can not turn his hand , whatever he may think himself .
Parsing [sent. 4980 len. 14]: You see , Mr Walton , it is not like a routine trade .
Parsing [sent. 4981 len. 9]: Things are never twice the same at sea .
Parsing [sent. 4982 len. 28]: The sailor has a thousand chances of using his judgment , if he has any to use ; and that Old Rogers has in no common degree .
Parsing [sent. 4983 len. 9]: So I should have no fear of him .
Parsing [sent. 4984 len. 21]: If he wo n't let me steer him , you must put your hand to the tiller for me . ''
Parsing [sent. 4985 len. 27]: `` I will do what I can , '' I answered ; `` for nothing would please me more than to see him in your service .
Parsing [sent. 4986 len. 24]: It would be much better for him , and his wife too , than living by uncertain jobs as he does now . ''
Parsing [sent. 4987 len. 39]: The result of it all was , that Old Rogers consented to try for a month ; but when the end of the month came , nothing was said on either side , and the old man remained .
Parsing [sent. 4988 len. 21]: And I could see several little new comforts about the cottage , in consequence of the regularity of his wages .
Parsing [sent. 4989 len. 10]: Now I must report another occurrence in regular sequence .
Parsing [sent. 4990 len. 41]: To my surprise , and , I must confess , not a little to my discomposure , when I rose in the reading-desk on the day after this dinner with Dr Duncan , I saw that the Hall-pew was full .
Parsing [sent. 4991 len. 27]: Miss Oldcastle was there for the first time , and , by her side , the gentleman whom the day before I had encountered on horseback .
Parsing [sent. 4992 len. 66]: He sat carelessly , easily , contentedly -- indifferently ; for , although I never that morning looked up from my Prayer-book , except involuntarily in the changes of posture , I could not help seeing that he was always behind the rest of the congregation , as if he had no idea of what was coming next , or did not care to conform .
Parsing [sent. 4993 len. 19]: Gladly would I , that day , have shunned the necessity of preaching that was laid upon me .
Parsing [sent. 4994 len. 27]: `` But , '' I said to myself , `` shall the work given me to do fare ill because of the perturbation of my spirit ?
Parsing [sent. 4995 len. 24]: No harm is done , though I suffer ; but much harm if one tone fails of its force because I suffer . ''
Parsing [sent. 4996 len. 60]: I therefore prayed God to help me ; and feeling the right , because I felt the need , of looking to Him for aid , I cast my care upon Him , kept my thoughts strenuously away from that which discomposed me , and never turned my eyes towards the Hall-pew from the moment I entered the pulpit .
Parsing [sent. 4997 len. 42]: And partly , I presume , from the freedom given by the sense of irresponsibility for the result , I being weak and God strong , I preached , I think , a better sermon than I had ever preached before .
Parsing [sent. 4998 len. 58]: But when I got into the vestry I found that I could scarcely stand for trembling ; and I must have looked ill , for when my attendant came in he got me a glass of wine without even asking me if I would have it , although it was not my custom to take any there .
Parsing [sent. 4999 len. 27]: But there was one of my congregation that morning who suffered more than I did from the presence of one of those who filled the Hall-pew .
Parsing [sent. 5000 len. 48]: I recovered in a few moments from my weakness , but , altogether disinclined to face any of my congregation , went out at my vestry-door , and home through the shrubbery -- a path I seldom used , because it had a separatist look about it .
Parsing [sent. 5001 len. 19]: When I got to my study , I threw myself on a couch , and fell fast asleep .
Parsing [sent. 5002 len. 20]: How often in trouble have I had to thank God for sleep as for one of His best gifts !
Parsing [sent. 5003 len. 65]: And how often when I have awaked refreshed and calm , have I thought of poor Sir Philip Sidney , who , dying slowly and patiently in the prime of life and health , was sorely troubled in his mind to know how he had offended God , because , having prayed earnestly for sleep , no sleep came in answer to his cry !
Parsing [sent. 5004 len. 29]: I woke just in time for my afternoon service ; and the inward peace in which I found my heart was to myself a marvel and a delight .
Parsing [sent. 5005 len. 24]: I felt almost as if I was walking in a blessed dream come from a world of serener air than this of ours .
Parsing [sent. 5006 len. 60]: I found , after I was already in the reading-desk , that I was a few minutes early ; and while , with bowed head , I was simply living in the consciousness of the presence of a supreme quiet , the first low notes of the organ broke upon my stillness with the sense of a deeper delight .
Parsing [sent. 5007 len. 30]: Never before had I felt , as I felt that afternoon , the triumph of contemplation in Handel 's rendering of `` I know that my Redeemer liveth . ''
Parsing [sent. 5008 len. 56]: And I felt how through it all ran a cold silvery quiver of sadness , like the light in the east after the sun is gone down , which would have been pain , but for the golden glow of the west , which looks after the light of the world with a patient waiting .
Parsing [sent. 5009 len. 27]: -- Before the music ceased , it had crossed my mind that I had never before heard that organ utter itself in the language of Handel .
Parsing [sent. 5010 len. 35]: But I had no time to think more about it just then , for I rose to read the words of our Lord , `` I will arise and go to my Father . ''
Parsing [sent. 5011 len. 23]: There was no one in the Hall-pew ; indeed it was a rare occurrence if any one was there in the afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 5012 len. 54]: But for all the quietness of my mind during that evening service , I felt ill before I went to bed , and awoke in the morning with a headache , which increased along with other signs of perturbation of the system , until I thought it better to send for Dr Duncan .
Parsing [sent. 5013 len. 50]: I have not yet got so imbecile as to suppose that a history of the following six weeks would be interesting to my readers -- for during so long did I suffer from low fever ; and more weeks passed during which I was unable to meet my flock .
Parsing [sent. 5014 len. 47]: Thanks to the care of Mr Brownrigg , a clever young man in priest 's orders , who was living at Addicehead while waiting for a curacy , kindly undertook my duty for me , and thus relieved me from all anxiety about supplying my place .
Parsing [sent. 5015 len. 3]: CHAPTER XVII .
Parsing [sent. 5016 len. 3]: THE CHURCH-RATE .
Parsing [sent. 5017 len. 26]: But I can not express equal satisfaction in regard to everything that Mr Brownrigg took upon his own responsibility , as my reader will see .
Parsing [sent. 5018 len. 93]: He , and another farmer , his neighbour , had been so often re-elected churchwardens , that at last they seemed to have gained a prescriptive right to the office , and the form of election fell into disuse ; so much so , that after Mr Summer 's death , which took place some year and a half before I became Vicar of Marshmallows , Mr Brownrigg continued to exercise the duty in his own single person , and nothing had as yet been said about the election of a colleague .
Parsing [sent. 5019 len. 28]: So little seemed to fall to the duty of the churchwarden that I regarded the neglect as a trifle , and was remiss in setting it right .
Parsing [sent. 5020 len. 12]: I had , therefore , to suffer , as was just .
Parsing [sent. 5021 len. 16]: Indeed , Mr Brownrigg was not the man to have power in his hands unchecked .
Parsing [sent. 5022 len. 74]: I had so far recovered that I was able to rise about noon and go into my study , though I was very weak , and had not yet been out , when one morning Mrs Pearson came into the room and said , -- `` Please , sir , here 's young Thomas Weir in a great way about something , and insisting upon seeing you , if you possibly can . ''
Parsing [sent. 5023 len. 67]: I had as yet seen very few of my friends , except the Doctor , and those only for two or three minutes ; but although I did not feel very fit for seeing anybody just then , I could not but yield to his desire , confident there must be a good reason for it , and so told Mrs Pearson to show him in .
Parsing [sent. 5024 len. 39]: `` Oh , sir , I know you would be vexed if you had n't been told , '' he exclaimed , `` and I am sure you will not be angry with me for troubling you . ''
Parsing [sent. 5025 len. 9]: `` What is the matter , Tom ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5026 len. 3]: I said .
Parsing [sent. 5027 len. 13]: `` I assure you I shall not be angry with you . ''
Parsing [sent. 5028 len. 26]: `` There 's Farmer Brownrigg , at this very moment , taking away Mr Templeton 's table because he wo n't pay the church-rate . ''
Parsing [sent. 5029 len. 5]: `` What church-rate ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5030 len. 9]: I cried , starting up from the sofa .
Parsing [sent. 5031 len. 9]: `` I never heard of a church-rate . ''
Parsing [sent. 5032 len. 15]: Now , before I go farther , it is necessary to explain some things .
Parsing [sent. 5033 len. 35]: One day before I was taken ill , I had had a little talk with Mr Brownrigg about some repairs of the church which were necessary , and must be done before another winter .
Parsing [sent. 5034 len. 50]: I confess I was rather pleased ; for I wanted my people to feel that the church was their property , and that it was their privilege , if they could regard it as a blessing to have the church , to keep it in decent order and repair .
Parsing [sent. 5035 len. 29]: So I said , in a by-the-by way , to my churchwarden , `` We must call a vestry before long , and have this looked to . ''
Parsing [sent. 5036 len. 29]: Now my predecessor had left everything of the kind to his churchwardens ; and the inhabitants from their side had likewise left the whole affair to the churchwardens .
Parsing [sent. 5037 len. 63]: But Mr Brownrigg , who , I must say , had taken more pains than might have been expected of him to make himself acquainted with the legalities of his office , did not fail to call a vestry , to which , as usual , no one had responded ; whereupon he imposed a rate according to his own unaided judgment .
Parsing [sent. 5038 len. 32]: This , I believe , he did during my illness , with the notion of pleasing me by the discovery that the repairs had been already effected according to my mind .
Parsing [sent. 5039 len. 17]: Nor did any one of my congregation throw the least difficulty in the churchwarden 's way .
Parsing [sent. 5040 len. 16]: -- And now I must refer to another circumstance in the history of my parish .
Parsing [sent. 5041 len. 16]: I think I have already alluded to the fact that there were Dissenters in Marshmallows .
Parsing [sent. 5042 len. 27]: There was a little chapel down a lane leading from the main street of the village , in which there was service three times every Sunday .
Parsing [sent. 5043 len. 40]: People came to it from many parts of the parish , amongst whom were the families of two or three farmers of substance , while the village and its neighbourhood contributed a portion of the poorest of the inhabitants .
Parsing [sent. 5044 len. 52]: A year or two before I came , their minister died , and they had chosen another , a very worthy man , of considerable erudition , but of extreme views , as I heard , upon insignificant points , and moved by a great dislike to national churches and episcopacy .
Parsing [sent. 5045 len. 49]: This , I say , is what I had made out about him from what I had heard ; and my reader will very probably be inclined to ask , `` But why , with principles such as yours , should you have only hearsay to go upon ?
Parsing [sent. 5046 len. 11]: Why did you not make the honest man 's acquaintance ?
Parsing [sent. 5047 len. 18]: In such a small place , men should not keep each other at arm 's length . ''
Parsing [sent. 5048 len. 11]: And any reader who says so , will say right .
Parsing [sent. 5049 len. 72]: All I have to suggest for myself is simply a certain shyness , for which I can not entirely account , but which was partly made up of fear to intrude , or of being supposed to arrogate to myself the right of making advances , partly of a dread lest we should not be able to get on together , and so the attempt should result in something unpleasantly awkward .
Parsing [sent. 5050 len. 19]: I daresay , likewise , that the natural SHELLINESS of the English had something to do with it .
Parsing [sent. 5051 len. 11]: At all events , I had not made his acquaintance .
Parsing [sent. 5052 len. 100]: Mr Templeton , then , had refused , as a point of conscience , to pay the church-rate when the collector went round to demand it ; had been summoned before a magistrate in consequence ; had suffered a default ; and , proceedings being pushed from the first in all the pride of Mr Brownrigg 's legality , had on this very day been visited by the churchwarden , accompanied by a broker from the neighbouring town of Addicehead , and at the very time when I was hearing of the fact was suffering distraint of his goods .
Parsing [sent. 5053 len. 18]: The porcine head of the churchwarden was not on his shoulders by accident , nor without significance .
Parsing [sent. 5054 len. 11]: But I did not wait to understand all this now .
Parsing [sent. 5055 len. 23]: It was enough for me that Tom bore witness to the fact that at that moment proceedings were thus driven to extremity .
Parsing [sent. 5056 len. 27]: I rang the bell for my boots , and , to the open-mouthed dismay of Mrs Pearson , left the vicarage leaning on Tom 's arm .
Parsing [sent. 5057 len. 21]: But such was the commotion in my mind , that I had become quite unconscious of illness or even feebleness .
Parsing [sent. 5058 len. 41]: Hurrying on in more terror than I can well express lest I should be too late , I reached Mr Templeton 's house just as a small mahogany table was being hoisted into a spring-cart which stood at the door .
Parsing [sent. 5059 len. 21]: Breathless with haste , I was yet able to call out , -- `` Put that table down directly . ''
Parsing [sent. 5060 len. 12]: At the same moment Mr Brownrigg appeared from within the door .
Parsing [sent. 5061 len. 21]: He approached with the self-satisfied look of a man who has done his duty , and is proud of it .
Parsing [sent. 5062 len. 8]: I think he had not heard me .
Parsing [sent. 5063 len. 14]: `` You see I 'm prompt , Mr Walton , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 5064 len. 13]: `` But , bless my soul , how ill you look ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5065 len. 32]: Without answering him -- for I was more angry with him than I ought to have been -- I repeated -- `` Put that table down , I tell you . ''
Parsing [sent. 5066 len. 4]: They did so .
Parsing [sent. 5067 len. 16]: `` Now , '' I said , `` carry it back into the house . ''
Parsing [sent. 5068 len. 17]: `` Why , sir , '' interposed Mr Brownrigg , `` it 's all right . ''
Parsing [sent. 5069 len. 18]: `` Yes , '' I said , `` as right as the devil would have it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5070 len. 16]: `` I assure you , sir , I have done everything according to law . ''
Parsing [sent. 5071 len. 9]: `` I 'm not so sure of that .
Parsing [sent. 5072 len. 40]: I believe I had the right to be chairman at the vestry-meeting ; but , instead of even letting me know , you took advantage of my illness to hurry on matters to this shameful and wicked excess . ''
Parsing [sent. 5073 len. 21]: I did the poor man wrong in this , for I believe he had hurried things really to please me .
Parsing [sent. 5074 len. 15]: His face had lengthened considerably by this time , and its rubicund hue declined .
Parsing [sent. 5075 len. 15]: `` I did not think you would stand upon ceremony about it , sir .
Parsing [sent. 5076 len. 9]: You never seemed to care for business . ''
Parsing [sent. 5077 len. 19]: `` If you talk about legality , so will I. Certainly YOU do n't stand upon ceremony . ''
Parsing [sent. 5078 len. 29]: `` I did n't expect you would turn against your own churchwarden in the execution of his duty , sir , '' he said in an offended tone .
Parsing [sent. 5079 len. 36]: `` It 's bad enough to have a meetin ' - house in the place , without one 's own parson siding with t ` other parson as wo n't pay a lawful church-rate . ''
Parsing [sent. 5080 len. 22]: `` I would have paid the church-rate for the whole parish ten times over before such a thing should have happened .
Parsing [sent. 5081 len. 16]: I feel so disgraced , I am ashamed to look Mr Templeton in the face .
Parsing [sent. 5082 len. 11]: Carry that table into the house again , directly . ''
Parsing [sent. 5083 len. 13]: `` It 's my property , now , '' interposed the broker .
Parsing [sent. 5084 len. 15]: `` I 've bought it of the churchwarden , and paid for it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5085 len. 6]: I turned to Mr Brownrigg .
Parsing [sent. 5086 len. 11]: `` How much did he give you for it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5087 len. 3]: I asked .
Parsing [sent. 5088 len. 19]: `` Twenty shillings , '' returned he , sulkily , `` and it wo n't pay expenses . ''
Parsing [sent. 5089 len. 5]: `` Twenty shillings ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5090 len. 16]: I exclaimed ; `` for a table that cost three times as much at least !
Parsing [sent. 5091 len. 11]: -- What do you expect to sell it for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5092 len. 11]: `` That 's my business , '' answered the broker .
Parsing [sent. 5093 len. 24]: I pulled out my purse , and threw a sovereign and a half on the table , saying -- `` FIFTY PER CENT .
Parsing [sent. 5094 len. 15]: will be , I think , profit enough even on such a transaction . ''
Parsing [sent. 5095 len. 14]: `` I did not offer you the table , '' returned the broker .
Parsing [sent. 5096 len. 18]: `` I am not bound to sell except I please , and at my own price . ''
Parsing [sent. 5097 len. 3]: `` Possibly .
Parsing [sent. 5098 len. 10]: But I tell you the whole affair is illegal .
Parsing [sent. 5099 len. 19]: And if you carry away that table , I shall see what the law will do for me .
Parsing [sent. 5100 len. 9]: I assure you I will prosecute you myself .
Parsing [sent. 5101 len. 10]: You take up that money , or I will .
Parsing [sent. 5102 len. 24]: It will go to pay counsel , I give you my word , if you do not take it to quench strife . ''
Parsing [sent. 5103 len. 6]: I stretched out my hand .
Parsing [sent. 5104 len. 7]: But the broker was before me .
Parsing [sent. 5105 len. 45]: Without another word , he pocketed the money , jumped into his cart with his man , and drove off , leaving the churchwarden and the parson standing at the door of the dissenting minister with his mahogany table on the path between them .
Parsing [sent. 5106 len. 23]: `` Now , Mr Brownrigg , '' I said , `` lend me a hand to carry this table in again . ''
Parsing [sent. 5107 len. 18]: He yielded , not graciously , -- that could not be expected , -- but in silence .
Parsing [sent. 5108 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 5109 len. 21]: sir , '' interposed young Tom , who had stood by during the dispute , `` let me take it .
Parsing [sent. 5110 len. 9]: You 're not able to lift it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5111 len. 3]: `` Nonsense !
Parsing [sent. 5112 len. 2]: Tom .
Parsing [sent. 5113 len. 7]: Keep away , '' I said .
Parsing [sent. 5114 len. 11]: `` It is all the reparation I can make . ''
Parsing [sent. 5115 len. 28]: And so Mr Brownrigg and I blundered into the little parlour with our burden -- not a great one , but I began to find myself failing .
Parsing [sent. 5116 len. 14]: Mr Templeton sat in a Windsor chair in the middle of the room .
Parsing [sent. 5117 len. 16]: Evidently the table had been carried away from before him , leaving his position uncovered .
Parsing [sent. 5118 len. 13]: The floor was strewed with the books which had lain upon it .
Parsing [sent. 5119 len. 13]: He sat reading an old folio , as if nothing had happened .
Parsing [sent. 5120 len. 7]: But when we entered he rose .
Parsing [sent. 5121 len. 20]: He was a man of middle size , about forty , with short black hair and overhanging bushy eyebrows .
Parsing [sent. 5122 len. 16]: His mouth indicated great firmness , not unmingled with sweetness , and even with humour .
Parsing [sent. 5123 len. 37]: He smiled as he rose , but looked embarrassed , glancing first at the table , then at me , and then at Mr Brownrigg , as if begging somebody to tell him what to say .
Parsing [sent. 5124 len. 12]: But I did not leave him a moment in this perplexity .
Parsing [sent. 5125 len. 50]: `` Mr Templeton , '' I said , quitting the table , and holding out my hand , `` I beg your pardon for myself and my friend here , my churchwarden '' -- Mr Brownrigg gave a grunt -- `` that you should have been annoyed like this .
Parsing [sent. 5126 len. 9]: I have -- '' Mr Templeton interrupted me .
Parsing [sent. 5127 len. 17]: `` I assure you it was a matter of conscience with me , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 5128 len. 26]: `` On no other ground -- '' `` I know it , I know it , '' I said , interrupting him in my turn .
Parsing [sent. 5129 len. 18]: `` I beg your pardon ; and I have done my best to make amends for it .
Parsing [sent. 5130 len. 56]: Offences must come , you know , Mr Templeton ; but I trust I have not incurred the woe that follows upon them by means of whom they come , for I knew nothing of it , and indeed was too ill -- '' Here my strength left me altogether , and I sat down .
Parsing [sent. 5131 len. 45]: The room began to whirl round me , and I remember nothing more till I knew that I was lying on a couch , with Mrs Templeton bathing my forehead , and Mr Templeton trying to get something into my mouth with a spoon .
Parsing [sent. 5132 len. 48]: Ashamed to find myself in such circumstances , I tried to rise ; but Mr Templeton , laying his hand on mine , said -- `` My dear sir , add to your kindness this day , by letting my wife and me minister to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 5133 len. 9]: Now , was not that a courteous speech ?
Parsing [sent. 5134 len. 22]: He went on -- `` Mr Brownrigg has gone for Dr Duncan , and will be back in a few moments .
Parsing [sent. 5135 len. 9]: I beg you will not exert yourself . ''
Parsing [sent. 5136 len. 6]: I yielded and lay still .
Parsing [sent. 5137 len. 4]: Dr Duncan came .
Parsing [sent. 5138 len. 10]: His carriage followed , and I was taken home .
Parsing [sent. 5139 len. 45]: Before we started , I said to Mr Brownrigg -- for I could not rest till I had said it -- `` Mr Brownrigg , I spoke in heat when I came up to you , and I am sure I did you wrong .
Parsing [sent. 5140 len. 17]: I am certain you had no improper motive in not making me acquainted with your proceedings .
Parsing [sent. 5141 len. 7]: You meant no harm to me .
Parsing [sent. 5142 len. 9]: But you did very wrong towards Mr Templeton .
Parsing [sent. 5143 len. 30]: I will try to show you that when I am well again ; but -- '' `` But you must n't talk more now , '' said Dr Duncan .
Parsing [sent. 5144 len. 12]: So I shook hands with Mr Brownrigg , and we parted .
Parsing [sent. 5145 len. 52]: I fear , from what I know of my churchwarden , that he went home with the conviction that he had done perfectly right ; and that the parson had made an apology for interfering with a churchwarden who was doing his best to uphold the dignity of Church and State .
Parsing [sent. 5146 len. 10]: But perhaps I may be doing him wrong again .
Parsing [sent. 5147 len. 38]: I went home to a week more of bed , and a lengthened process of recovery , during which many were the kind inquiries made after me by my friends , and amongst them by Mr Templeton .
Parsing [sent. 5148 len. 18]: And here I may as well sketch the result of that strange introduction to the dissenting minister .
Parsing [sent. 5149 len. 34]: After I was tolerably well again , I received a friendly letter from him one day , expostulating with me on the inconsistency of my remaining within the pale of the ESTABLISHED CHURCH .
Parsing [sent. 5150 len. 94]: The gist of the letter lay in these words : -- `` I confess it perplexes me to understand how to reconcile your Christian and friendly behaviour to one whom most of your brethren would consider as much beneath their notice as inferior to them in social position , with your remaining the minister of a Church in which such enormities as you employed your private influence to counteract in my case , are not only possible , but certainly lawful , and recognized by most of its members as likewise expedient . ''
Parsing [sent. 5151 len. 25]: To this I replied : -- `` MY DEAR SIR , -- I do not like writing letters , especially on subjects of importance .
Parsing [sent. 5152 len. 8]: There are a thousand chances of misunderstanding .
Parsing [sent. 5153 len. 18]: Whereas , in a personal interview , there is a possibility of controversy being hallowed by communion .
Parsing [sent. 5154 len. 54]: Come and dine with me to-morrow , at any hour convenient to you , and make my apologies to Mrs Templeton for not inviting her with you , on the ground that we want to have a long talk with each other without the distracting influence which even her presence would unavoidably occasion .
Parsing [sent. 5155 len. 10]: `` I am , '' & c. & c .
Parsing [sent. 5156 len. 7]: He accepted my invitation at once .
Parsing [sent. 5157 len. 39]: During dinner we talked away , not upon indifferent , but upon the most interesting subjects -- connected with the poor , and parish work , and the influence of the higher upon the lower classes of society .
Parsing [sent. 5158 len. 55]: At length we sat down on opposite sides of the fire ; and as soon as Mrs Pearson had shut the door , I said , -- `` You ask me , Mr Templeton , in your very kind letter -- '' and here I put my hand in my pocket to find it .
Parsing [sent. 5159 len. 30]: `` I asked you , '' interposed Mr Templeton , `` how you could belong to a Church which authorizes things of which you yourself so heartily disapprove . ''
Parsing [sent. 5160 len. 22]: `` And I answer you , '' I returned , `` that just to such a Church our Lord belonged . ''
Parsing [sent. 5161 len. 9]: `` I do not quite understand you . ''
Parsing [sent. 5162 len. 10]: `` Our Lord belonged to the Jewish Church . ''
Parsing [sent. 5163 len. 8]: `` But ours is His Church . ''
Parsing [sent. 5164 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 5165 len. 6]: But principles remain the same .
Parsing [sent. 5166 len. 10]: I speak of Him as belonging to a Church .
Parsing [sent. 5167 len. 24]: His conduct would be the same in the same circumstances , whatever Church He belonged to , because He would always do right .
Parsing [sent. 5168 len. 24]: I want , if you will allow me , to show you the principle upon which He acted with regard to church-rates . ''
Parsing [sent. 5169 len. 3]: `` Certainly .
Parsing [sent. 5170 len. 9]: I beg your pardon for interrupting you . ''
Parsing [sent. 5171 len. 24]: `` The Pharisees demanded a tribute , which , it is allowed , was for the support of the temple and its worship .
Parsing [sent. 5172 len. 27]: Our Lord did not refuse to acknowledge their authority , notwithstanding the many ways in which they had degraded the religious observances of the Jewish Church .
Parsing [sent. 5173 len. 46]: He acknowledged himself a child of the Church , but said that , as a child , He ought to have been left to contribute as He pleased to the support of its ordinances , and not to be compelled after such a fashion . ''
Parsing [sent. 5174 len. 11]: `` There I have you , '' exclaimed Mr Templeton .
Parsing [sent. 5175 len. 23]: `` He said they were wrong to make the tribute , or church-rate , if it really was such , compulsory . ''
Parsing [sent. 5176 len. 15]: `` I grant it : it is entirely wrong -- a very unchristian proceeding .
Parsing [sent. 5177 len. 17]: But our Lord did not therefore desert the Church , as you would have me do .
Parsing [sent. 5178 len. 10]: HE PAID THE MONEY , lest He should offend .
Parsing [sent. 5179 len. 48]: And not having it of His own , He had to ask His Father for it ; or , what came to the same thing , make a servant of His Father , namely , a fish in the sea of Galilee , bring Him the money .
Parsing [sent. 5180 len. 9]: And there I have YOU , Mr Templeton .
Parsing [sent. 5181 len. 17]: It is wrong to compel , and wrong to refuse , the payment of a church-rate .
Parsing [sent. 5182 len. 18]: I do not say equally wrong : it is much worse to compel than to refuse . ''
Parsing [sent. 5183 len. 11]: `` You are very generous , '' returned Mr Templeton .
Parsing [sent. 5184 len. 39]: `` May I hope that you will do me the credit to believe that if I saw clearly that they were the same thing , I would not hesitate a moment to follow our Lord 's example . ''
Parsing [sent. 5185 len. 6]: `` I believe it perfectly .
Parsing [sent. 5186 len. 16]: Therefore , however we may differ , we are in reality at no strife . ''
Parsing [sent. 5187 len. 31]: `` But is there not this difference , that our Lord was , as you say , a child of the Jewish Church , which was indubitably established by God ?
Parsing [sent. 5188 len. 25]: Now , if I can not conscientiously belong to the so-called English Church , why should I have to pay church-rate or tribute ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5189 len. 14]: `` Shall I tell you the argument the English Church might then use ?
Parsing [sent. 5190 len. 33]: The Church might say , ` Then you are a stranger , and no child ; therefore , like the kings of the earth , we MAY take tribute of you . '
Parsing [sent. 5191 len. 20]: So you see it would come to this , that Dissenters alone should be COMPELLED to pay church-rates . ''
Parsing [sent. 5192 len. 13]: We both laughed at this pushing of the argument to illegitimate conclusions .
Parsing [sent. 5193 len. 50]: Then I resumed : `` But the real argument is that not for such faults should we separate from each other ; not for such faults , or any faults , so long as it is the repository of the truth , should you separate from the Church . ''
Parsing [sent. 5194 len. 52]: `` I will yield the point when you can show me the same ground for believing the Church of England THE NATIONAL CHURCH , appointed such by God , that I can show you , and you know already , for receiving the Jewish Church as the appointment of God . ''
Parsing [sent. 5195 len. 34]: `` That would involve a long argument , upon which , though I have little doubt upon the matter myself , I can not say I am prepared to enter at this moment .
Parsing [sent. 5196 len. 98]: Meantime , I would just ask you whether you are not sufficiently a child of the Church of England , having received from it a thousand influences for good , if in no other way , yet through your fathers , to find it no great hardship , and not very unreasonable , to pay a trifle to keep in repair one of the tabernacles in which our forefathers worshipped together , if , as I hope you will allow , in some imperfect measure God is worshipped , and the truth is preached in it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5197 len. 9]: `` Most willingly would I pay the money .
Parsing [sent. 5198 len. 10]: I object simply because the rate is compulsory . ''
Parsing [sent. 5199 len. 14]: `` And therein you have our Lord 's example to the contrary . ''
Parsing [sent. 5200 len. 18]: A silence followed ; for I had to deal with an honest man , who was thinking .
Parsing [sent. 5201 len. 20]: I resumed : -- `` A thousand difficulties will no doubt come up to be considered in the matter .
Parsing [sent. 5202 len. 10]: Do not suppose I am anxious to convince you .
Parsing [sent. 5203 len. 34]: I believe that our Father , our Elder Brother , and the Spirit that proceedeth from them , is teaching you , as I believe I too am being taught by the same .
Parsing [sent. 5204 len. 14]: Why , then , should I be anxious to convince you of anything ?
Parsing [sent. 5205 len. 17]: Will you not in His good time come to see what He would have you see ?
Parsing [sent. 5206 len. 28]: I am relieved to speak my mind , knowing He would have us speak our minds to each other ; but I do not want to proselytize .
Parsing [sent. 5207 len. 47]: If you change your mind , you will probably do so on different grounds from any I give you , on grounds which show themselves in the course of your own search after the foundations of truth in regard perhaps to some other question altogether . ''
Parsing [sent. 5208 len. 5]: Again a silence followed .
Parsing [sent. 5209 len. 35]: Then Mr Templeton spoke : -- `` Do n't think I am satisfied , '' he said , `` because I do n't choose to say anything more till I have thought about it .
Parsing [sent. 5210 len. 28]: I think you are wrong in your conclusions about the Church , though surely you are right in thinking we ought to have patience with each other .
Parsing [sent. 5211 len. 78]: And now tell me true , Mr Walton , -- I 'm a blunt kind of man , descended from an old Puritan , one of Cromwell 's Ironsides , I believe , and I have n't been to a university like you , but I 'm no fool either , I hope , -- do n't be offended at my question : would n't you be glad to see me out of your parish now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5212 len. 10]: I began to speak , but he went on .
Parsing [sent. 5213 len. 28]: `` Do n't you regard me as an interloper now -- one who has no right to speak because he does not belong to the Church ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5214 len. 5]: `` God forbid ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5215 len. 3]: I answered .
Parsing [sent. 5216 len. 20]: `` If a word of mine would make you leave my parish to-morrow , I dare not say it .
Parsing [sent. 5217 len. 25]: I do not want to incur the rebuke of our Lord -- for surely the words ` Forbid him not ' involved some rebuke .
Parsing [sent. 5218 len. 34]: Would it not be a fearful thing that one soul , because of a deed of mine , should receive a less portion of elevation or comfort in his journey towards his home ?
Parsing [sent. 5219 len. 10]: Are there not countless modes of saying the truth ?
Parsing [sent. 5220 len. 6]: You have some of them .
Parsing [sent. 5221 len. 6]: I hope I have some .
Parsing [sent. 5222 len. 10]: People will hear you who will not hear me .
Parsing [sent. 5223 len. 14]: Preach to them in the name and love of God , Mr Templeton .
Parsing [sent. 5224 len. 12]: Speak that you do know and testify that you have seen .
Parsing [sent. 5225 len. 16]: You and I will help each other , in proportion as we serve the Master .
Parsing [sent. 5226 len. 35]: I only say that in separating from us you are in effect , and by your conduct , saying to us , `` Do not preach , for you follow not with us . ''
Parsing [sent. 5227 len. 11]: I will not be guilty of the same towards you .
Parsing [sent. 5228 len. 13]: Your fathers did the Church no end of good by leaving it .
Parsing [sent. 5229 len. 9]: But it is time to unite now . ''
Parsing [sent. 5230 len. 6]: Once more followed a silence .
Parsing [sent. 5231 len. 40]: `` If people could only meet , and look each other in the face , '' said Mr Templeton at length , `` they might find there was not such a gulf between them as they had fancied . ''
Parsing [sent. 5232 len. 5]: And so we parted .
Parsing [sent. 5233 len. 15]: Now I do not write all this for the sake of the church-rate question .
Parsing [sent. 5234 len. 14]: I write it to commemorate the spirit in which Mr Templeton met me .
Parsing [sent. 5235 len. 55]: For it is of consequence that two men who love their Master should recognize each that the other does so , and thereupon , if not before , should cease to be estranged because of difference of opinion , which surely , inevitable as offence , does not involve the same denunciation of woe .
Parsing [sent. 5236 len. 14]: After this Mr Templeton and I found some opportunities of helping each other .
Parsing [sent. 5237 len. 15]: And many a time ere his death we consulted together about things that befell .
Parsing [sent. 5238 len. 43]: Once he came to me about a legal difficulty in connexion with the deed of trust of his chapel ; and although I could not help him myself , I directed him to such help as was thorough and cost him nothing .
Parsing [sent. 5239 len. 18]: I need not say he never became a churchman , or that I never expected he would .
Parsing [sent. 5240 len. 35]: All his memories of a religious childhood , all the sources of the influences which had refined and elevated him , were surrounded with other associations than those of the Church and her forms .
Parsing [sent. 5241 len. 25]: The Church was his grandmother , not his mother , and he had not made any acquaintance with her till comparatively late in life .
Parsing [sent. 5242 len. 35]: But while I do not say that his intellectual objections to the Church were less strong than they had been , I am sure that his feelings were moderated , even changed towards her .
Parsing [sent. 5243 len. 46]: And though this may seem of no consequence to one who loves the Church more than the brotherhood , it does not seem of little consequence to me who love the Church because of the brotherhood of which it is the type and the restorer .
Parsing [sent. 5244 len. 11]: It was long before another church-rate was levied in Marshmallows .
Parsing [sent. 5245 len. 22]: And when the circumstance did take place , no one dreamed of calling on Mr Templeton for his share in it .
Parsing [sent. 5246 len. 24]: But , having heard of it , he called himself upon the churchwarden -- Mr Brownrigg still -- and offered the money cheerfully .
Parsing [sent. 5247 len. 13]: AND MR BROWRIGG REFUSED TO TAKE IT TILL HE HAD CONSULTED ME !
Parsing [sent. 5248 len. 30]: I told him to call on Mr Templeton , and say he would be much obliged to him for his contribution , and give him a receipt for it .
Parsing [sent. 5249 len. 3]: CHAPTER XVIII .
Parsing [sent. 5250 len. 4]: JUDY 'S NEWS .
Parsing [sent. 5251 len. 106]: Perhaps my reader may be sufficiently interested in the person , who , having once begun to tell his story , may possibly have allowed his feelings , in concert with the comfortable confidence afforded by the mask of namelessness , to run away with his pen , and so have babbled of himself more than he ought -- may be sufficiently interested , I say , in my mental condition , to cast a speculative thought upon the state of my mind , during my illness , with regard to Miss Oldcastle and the stranger who was her mother 's guest at the Hall .
Parsing [sent. 5252 len. 48]: Possibly , being by nature gifted , as I have certainly discovered , with more of hope than is usually mingled with the other elements composing the temperament of humanity , I did not suffer quite so much as some would have suffered during such an illness .
Parsing [sent. 5253 len. 73]: But I have reason to fear that when I was light-headed from fever , which was a not uncommon occurrence , especially in the early mornings during the worst of my illness -- when Mrs Pearson had to sit up with me , and sometimes an old woman of the village who was generally called in upon such occasions -- I may have talked a good deal of nonsense about Miss Oldcastle .
Parsing [sent. 5254 len. 43]: For I remember that I was haunted with visions of magnificent conventual ruins which I had discovered , and which , no one seeming to care about them but myself , I was left to wander through at my own lonely will .
Parsing [sent. 5255 len. 27]: Would I could see with the waking eye such a grandeur of Gothic arches and `` long-drawn aisles '' as then arose upon my sick sense !
Parsing [sent. 5256 len. 32]: Within was a labyrinth of passages in the walls , and `` long-sounding corridors , '' and sudden galleries , whence I looked down into the great church aching with silence .
Parsing [sent. 5257 len. 260]: Through these I was ever wandering , ever discovering new rooms , new galleries , new marvels of architecture ; ever disappointed and ever dissatisfied , because I knew that in one room somewhere in the forgotten mysteries of the pile sat Ethelwyn reading , never lifting those sea-blue eyes of hers from the great volume on her knee , reading every word , slowly turning leaf after leaf ; knew that she would sit there reading , till , one by one , every leaf in the huge volume was turned , and she came to the last and read it from top to bottom -- down to the finis and the urn with a weeping willow over it ; when she would close the book with a sigh , lay it down on the floor , rise and walk slowly away , and leave the glorious ruin dead to me as it had so long been to every one else ; knew that if I did not find her before that terrible last page was read , I should never find her at all ; but have to go wandering alone all my life through those dreary galleries and corridors , with one hope only left -- that I might yet before I died find the `` palace-chamber far apart , '' and see the read and forsaken volume lying on the floor where she had left it , and the chair beside it upon which she had sat so long waiting for some one in vain .
Parsing [sent. 5258 len. 41]: And perhaps to words spoken under these impressions may partly be attributed the fact , which I knew nothing of till long afterwards , that the people of the village began to couple my name with that of Miss Oldcastle .
Parsing [sent. 5259 len. 27]: When all this vanished from me in the returning wave of health that spread through my weary brain , I was yet left anxious and thoughtful .
Parsing [sent. 5260 len. 43]: There was no one from whom I could ask any information about the family at the Hall , so that I was just driven to the best thing -- to try to cast my care upon Him who cared for my care .
Parsing [sent. 5261 len. 14]: How often do we look upon God as our last and feeblest resource !
Parsing [sent. 5262 len. 12]: We go to Him because we have nowhere else to go .
Parsing [sent. 5263 len. 66]: And then we learn that the storms of life have driven us , not upon the rocks , but into the desired haven ; that we have been compelled , as to the last remaining , so to the best , the only , the central help , the causing cause of all the helps to which we had turned aside as nearer and better .
Parsing [sent. 5264 len. 29]: One day when , having considerably recovered from my second attack , I was sitting reading in my study , who should be announced but my friend Judy !
Parsing [sent. 5265 len. 18]: `` Oh , dear Mr Walton , I am so sorry you have been so ill ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5266 len. 19]: exclaimed the impulsive girl , taking my hand in both of hers , and sitting down beside me .
Parsing [sent. 5267 len. 31]: `` I have n't had a chance of coming to see you before ; though we 've always managed -- I mean auntie and I -- to hear about you .
Parsing [sent. 5268 len. 18]: I would have come to nurse you , but it was no use thinking of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5269 len. 7]: I smiled as I thanked her .
Parsing [sent. 5270 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 5271 len. 16]: you think because I 'm such a tom-boy , that I could n't nurse you .
Parsing [sent. 5272 len. 13]: I only wish I had had a chance of letting you see .
Parsing [sent. 5273 len. 8]: I am so sorry for you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5274 len. 20]: `` But I 'm nearly well now , Judy , and I have been taken good care of . ''
Parsing [sent. 5275 len. 38]: `` By that frumpy old thing , Mrs Pearson , and -- '' `` Mrs Pearson is a very kind woman , and an excellent nurse , '' I said ; but she would not heed me .
Parsing [sent. 5276 len. 10]: `` And that awful old witch , Mother Goose .
Parsing [sent. 5277 len. 16]: She was enough to give you bad dreams all night she sat by you . ''
Parsing [sent. 5278 len. 16]: `` I did n't dream about Mother Goose , as you call her , Judy .
Parsing [sent. 5279 len. 4]: I assure you .
Parsing [sent. 5280 len. 14]: But now I want to hear how everybody is at the Hall . ''
Parsing [sent. 5281 len. 14]: `` What , grannie , and the white wolf , and all ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5282 len. 12]: `` As many as you please to tell me about . ''
Parsing [sent. 5283 len. 12]: `` Well , grannie is gracious to everybody but auntie . ''
Parsing [sent. 5284 len. 10]: `` Why is n't she gracious to auntie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5285 len. 6]: `` I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 5286 len. 5]: I only guess . ''
Parsing [sent. 5287 len. 7]: `` Is your visitor gone ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5288 len. 6]: `` Yes , long ago .
Parsing [sent. 5289 len. 21]: Do you know , I think grannie wants auntie to marry him , and auntie does n't quite like it ?
Parsing [sent. 5290 len. 6]: But he 's very nice .
Parsing [sent. 5291 len. 5]: He 's so funny !
Parsing [sent. 5292 len. 10]: He 'll be back again soon , I daresay .
Parsing [sent. 5293 len. 20]: I do n't QUITE like him -- not so well as you by a whole half , Mr Walton .
Parsing [sent. 5294 len. 13]: I wish you would marry auntie ; but that would never do .
Parsing [sent. 5295 len. 10]: It would drive grannie out of her wits . ''
Parsing [sent. 5296 len. 25]: To stop the strange girl , and hide some confusion , I said : `` Now tell me about the rest of them . ''
Parsing [sent. 5297 len. 5]: `` Sarah comes next .
Parsing [sent. 5298 len. 10]: She 's as white and as wolfy as ever .
Parsing [sent. 5299 len. 8]: Mr Walton , I hate that woman .
Parsing [sent. 5300 len. 6]: She walks like a cat .
Parsing [sent. 5301 len. 8]: I am sure she is bad . ''
Parsing [sent. 5302 len. 18]: `` Did you ever think , Judy , what an awful thing it is to be bad ?
Parsing [sent. 5303 len. 21]: If you did , I think you would be so sorry for her , you could not hate her . ''
Parsing [sent. 5304 len. 56]: At the same time , knowing what I knew now , and remembering that impressions can date from farther back than the memory can reach , I was not surprised to hear that Judy hated Sarah , though I could not believe that in such a child the hatred was of the most deadly description .
Parsing [sent. 5305 len. 17]: `` I am afraid I must go on hating in the meantime , '' said Judy .
Parsing [sent. 5306 len. 14]: `` I wish some one would marry auntie , and turn Sarah away .
Parsing [sent. 5307 len. 13]: But that could n't be , so long as grannie lives . ''
Parsing [sent. 5308 len. 7]: `` How is Mr Stoddart ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5309 len. 4]: `` There now !
Parsing [sent. 5310 len. 18]: That 's one of the things auntie said I was to be sure to tell you . ''
Parsing [sent. 5311 len. 13]: `` Then your aunt knew you were coming to see me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5312 len. 9]: `` Oh , yes , I told her .
Parsing [sent. 5313 len. 6]: Not grannie , you know .
Parsing [sent. 5314 len. 9]: -- You must n't let it out . ''
Parsing [sent. 5315 len. 6]: `` I shall be careful .
Parsing [sent. 5316 len. 8]: How is Mr Stoddart , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5317 len. 6]: `` Not well at all .
Parsing [sent. 5318 len. 19]: He was taken ill before you , and has been in bed and by the fireside ever since .
Parsing [sent. 5319 len. 18]: Auntie does n't know what to do with him , he is so out of spirits . ''
Parsing [sent. 5320 len. 14]: `` If to-morrow is fine , I shall go and see him . ''
Parsing [sent. 5321 len. 4]: `` Thank you .
Parsing [sent. 5322 len. 9]: I believe that 's just what auntie wanted .
Parsing [sent. 5323 len. 11]: He wo n't like it at first , I daresay .
Parsing [sent. 5324 len. 13]: But he 'll come to , and you 'll do him good .
Parsing [sent. 5325 len. 9]: You do everybody good you come near . ''
Parsing [sent. 5326 len. 9]: `` I wish that were true , Judy .
Parsing [sent. 5327 len. 6]: I fear it is not .
Parsing [sent. 5328 len. 11]: What good did I ever do you , Judy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5329 len. 5]: `` Do me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5330 len. 10]: she exclaimed , apparently half angry at the question .
Parsing [sent. 5331 len. 18]: `` Do n't you know I have been an altered character ever since I knew you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5332 len. 18]: And here the odd creature laughed , leaving me in absolute ignorance of how to interpret her .
Parsing [sent. 5333 len. 19]: But presently her eyes grew clearer , and I could see the slow film of a tear gathering .
Parsing [sent. 5334 len. 18]: `` Mr Walton , '' she said , `` I HAVE been trying not to be selfish .
Parsing [sent. 5335 len. 9]: You have done me that much good . ''
Parsing [sent. 5336 len. 8]: `` I am very glad , Judy .
Parsing [sent. 5337 len. 10]: Do n't forget who can do you ALL good .
Parsing [sent. 5338 len. 26]: There is One who can not only show you what is right , but can make you able to do and be what is right .
Parsing [sent. 5339 len. 33]: You do n't know how much you have got to learn yet , Judy ; but there is that one Teacher ever ready to teach if you will only ask Him . ''
Parsing [sent. 5340 len. 13]: Judy did not answer , but sat looking fixedly at the carpet .
Parsing [sent. 5341 len. 9]: She was thinking , though , I saw .
Parsing [sent. 5342 len. 17]: `` Who has played the organ , Judy , since your uncle was taken ill ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5343 len. 6]: I asked , at length .
Parsing [sent. 5344 len. 9]: `` Why , auntie , to be sure .
Parsing [sent. 5345 len. 6]: Did n't you hear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5346 len. 37]: `` No , '' I answered , turning almost sick at the idea of having been away from church for so many Sundays while she was giving voice and expression to the dear asthmatic old pipes .
Parsing [sent. 5347 len. 20]: And I did feel very ready to murmur , like a spoilt child that had not had his way .
Parsing [sent. 5348 len. 9]: Think of HER there , and me here !
Parsing [sent. 5349 len. 34]: `` Then , '' I said to myself at last , `` it must have been she that played I know that my Redeemer liveth , that last time I was in church !
Parsing [sent. 5350 len. 20]: And instead of thanking God for that , here I am murmuring that He did not give me more !
Parsing [sent. 5351 len. 20]: And this child has just been telling me that I have taught her to try not to be selfish .
Parsing [sent. 5352 len. 9]: Certainly I should be ashamed of myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 5353 len. 9]: `` When was your uncle taken ill ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5354 len. 7]: `` I do n't exactly remember .
Parsing [sent. 5355 len. 9]: But you will come and see him to-morrow ?
Parsing [sent. 5356 len. 8]: And then we shall see you too .
Parsing [sent. 5357 len. 14]: For we are always out and in of his room just now . ''
Parsing [sent. 5358 len. 11]: `` I will come if Dr Duncan will let me .
Parsing [sent. 5359 len. 10]: Perhaps he will take me in his carriage . ''
Parsing [sent. 5360 len. 5]: `` No , no .
Parsing [sent. 5361 len. 7]: Do n't you come with him .
Parsing [sent. 5362 len. 6]: Uncle ca n't bear doctors .
Parsing [sent. 5363 len. 24]: He never was ill in his life before , and he behaves to Dr Duncan just as if he had made him ill .
Parsing [sent. 5364 len. 10]: I wish I could send the carriage for you .
Parsing [sent. 5365 len. 9]: But I ca n't , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 5366 len. 6]: `` Never mind , Judy .
Parsing [sent. 5367 len. 5]: I shall manage somehow .
Parsing [sent. 5368 len. 15]: -- What is the name of the gentleman who was staying with you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5369 len. 6]: `` Do n't you know ?
Parsing [sent. 5370 len. 4]: Captain George Everard .
Parsing [sent. 5371 len. 12]: He would change his name to Oldcastle , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 5372 len. 23]: What a foolish pain , like a spear-thrust , they sent through me -- those words spoken in such a taken-for-granted way !
Parsing [sent. 5373 len. 15]: `` He 's a relation -- on grannie 's side mostly , I believe .
Parsing [sent. 5374 len. 8]: But I never could understand the explanation .
Parsing [sent. 5375 len. 40]: What makes it harder is , that all the husbands and wives in our family , for a hundred and fifty years , have been more or less of cousins , or half-cousins , or second or third cousins .
Parsing [sent. 5376 len. 51]: Captain Everard has what grandmamma calls a neat little property of his own from his mother , some where in Northumberland ; for he IS only a third son , one of a class grannie does not in general feel very friendly to , I assure you , Mr Walton .
Parsing [sent. 5377 len. 45]: But his second brother is dead , and the eldest something the worse for the wear , as grannie says ; so that the captain comes just within sight of the coronet of an old uncle who ought to have been dead long ago .
Parsing [sent. 5378 len. 7]: Just the match for auntie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5379 len. 11]: `` But you say auntie does n't like him . ''
Parsing [sent. 5380 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 5381 len. 15]: but you know that does n't matter , '' returned Judy , with bitterness .
Parsing [sent. 5382 len. 8]: `` What will grannie care for that ?
Parsing [sent. 5383 len. 16]: It 's nothing to anybody but auntie , and she must get used to it .
Parsing [sent. 5384 len. 7]: Nobody makes anything of her . ''
Parsing [sent. 5385 len. 51]: It was only after she had gone that I thought how astounding it would have been to me to hear a girl of her age show such an acquaintance with worldliness and scheming , had I not been personally so much concerned about one of the objects of her remarks .
Parsing [sent. 5386 len. 7]: She certainly was a strange girl .
Parsing [sent. 5387 len. 25]: But strange as she was it was a satisfaction to think that the aunt had such a friend and ally in her wild niece .
Parsing [sent. 5388 len. 44]: Evidently she had inherited her father 's fearlessness ; and if only it should turn out that she had likewise inherited her mother 's firmness , she might render the best possible service to her aunt against the oppression of her wilful mother .
Parsing [sent. 5389 len. 11]: `` How were you able to get here to-day ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5390 len. 9]: I asked , as she rose to go .
Parsing [sent. 5391 len. 13]: `` Grannie is in London , and the wolf is with her .
Parsing [sent. 5392 len. 7]: Auntie would n't leave uncle . ''
Parsing [sent. 5393 len. 17]: `` They have been a good deal in London of late , have they not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5394 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 5395 len. 10]: They say it 's about money of auntie 's .
Parsing [sent. 5396 len. 6]: But I do n't understand .
Parsing [sent. 5397 len. 28]: _ I _ think it 's that grannie wants to make the captain marry her ; for they sometimes see him when they go to London . ''
Parsing [sent. 5398 len. 3]: CHAPTER XIX .
Parsing [sent. 5399 len. 3]: THE INVALID .
Parsing [sent. 5400 len. 30]: The following day being very fine , I walked to Oldcastle Hall ; but I remember well how much slower I was forced to walk than I was willing .
Parsing [sent. 5401 len. 13]: I found to my relief that Mrs Oldcastle had not yet returned .
Parsing [sent. 5402 len. 11]: I was shown at once to Mr Stoddart 's library .
Parsing [sent. 5403 len. 11]: There I found the two ladies in attendance upon him .
Parsing [sent. 5404 len. 41]: He was seated by a splendid fire , for the autumn days were now chilly on the shady side , in the most luxurious of easy chairs , with his furred feet buried in the long hair of the hearth-rug .
Parsing [sent. 5405 len. 6]: He looked worn and peevish .
Parsing [sent. 5406 len. 9]: All the placidity of his countenance had vanished .
Parsing [sent. 5407 len. 26]: The smooth expanse of his forehead was drawn into fifty wrinkles , like a sea over which the fretting wind has been blowing all night .
Parsing [sent. 5408 len. 10]: Nor was it only suffering that his face expressed .
Parsing [sent. 5409 len. 13]: He looked like a man who strongly suspected that he was ill-used .
Parsing [sent. 5410 len. 25]: After salutation , -- `` You are well off , Mr Stoddart , '' I said , `` to have two such nurses . ''
Parsing [sent. 5411 len. 29]: `` They are very kind , '' sighed the patient `` You would recommend Mrs Pearson and Mother Goose instead , would you not , Mr Walton ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5412 len. 10]: said Judy , her gray eyes sparkling with fun .
Parsing [sent. 5413 len. 16]: `` Judy , be quiet , '' said the invalid , languidly and yet sharply .
Parsing [sent. 5414 len. 6]: Judy reddened and was silent .
Parsing [sent. 5415 len. 14]: `` I am sorry to find you so unwell , '' I said .
Parsing [sent. 5416 len. 12]: `` Yes ; I am very ill , '' he returned .
Parsing [sent. 5417 len. 10]: Aunt and niece rose and left the room quietly .
Parsing [sent. 5418 len. 10]: `` Do you suffer much , Mr Stoddart ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5419 len. 8]: `` Much weariness , worse than pain .
Parsing [sent. 5420 len. 6]: I could welcome death . ''
Parsing [sent. 5421 len. 37]: `` I do not think , from what Dr Duncan says of you , that there is reason to apprehend more than a lingering illness , '' I said -- to try him , I confess .
Parsing [sent. 5422 len. 17]: `` I hope not indeed , '' he exclaimed angrily , sitting up in his chair .
Parsing [sent. 5423 len. 13]: `` What right has Dr Duncan to talk of me so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5424 len. 24]: `` To a friend , you know , '' I returned , apologetically , `` who is much interested in your welfare . ''
Parsing [sent. 5425 len. 6]: `` Yes , of course .
Parsing [sent. 5426 len. 5]: So is the doctor .
Parsing [sent. 5427 len. 11]: A sick man belongs to you both by prescription . ''
Parsing [sent. 5428 len. 19]: `` For my part I would rather talk about religion to a whole man than a sick man .
Parsing [sent. 5429 len. 9]: A sick man is not a WHOLE man .
Parsing [sent. 5430 len. 30]: He is but part of a man , as it were , for the time , and it is not so easy to tell what he can take . ''
Parsing [sent. 5431 len. 4]: `` Thank you .
Parsing [sent. 5432 len. 14]: I am obliged to you for my new position in the social scale .
Parsing [sent. 5433 len. 9]: Of the tailor species , I suppose . ''
Parsing [sent. 5434 len. 20]: I could not help wishing he were as far up as any man that does such needful honest work .
Parsing [sent. 5435 len. 10]: `` My dear sir , I beg your pardon .
Parsing [sent. 5436 len. 17]: I meant only a glance at the peculiar relation of the words WHOLE and HEAL . ''
Parsing [sent. 5437 len. 11]: `` I do not find etymology interesting at present . ''
Parsing [sent. 5438 len. 11]: `` Not seated in such a library as this ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5439 len. 8]: `` No ; I am ill . ''
Parsing [sent. 5440 len. 23]: Satisfied that , ill as he was , he might be better if he would , I resolved to make another trial .
Parsing [sent. 5441 len. 15]: `` Do you remember how Ligarius , in Julius Caesar , discards his sickness ?
Parsing [sent. 5442 len. 23]: -- '' ' I am not sick , if Brutus have in hand Any exploit worthy the name of honour . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 5443 len. 15]: `` I want to be well because I do n't like to be ill .
Parsing [sent. 5444 len. 26]: But what there is in this foggy , swampy world worth being well for , I 'm sure I have n't found out yet . ''
Parsing [sent. 5445 len. 18]: `` If you have not , it must be because you have never tried to find out .
Parsing [sent. 5446 len. 17]: But I 'm not going to attack you when you are not able to defend yourself .
Parsing [sent. 5447 len. 9]: We shall find a better time for that .
Parsing [sent. 5448 len. 9]: But ca n't I do something for you ?
Parsing [sent. 5449 len. 14]: Would you like me to read to you for half an hour ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5450 len. 6]: `` No , thank you .
Parsing [sent. 5451 len. 10]: The girls tire me out with reading to me .
Parsing [sent. 5452 len. 10]: I hate the very sound of their voices . ''
Parsing [sent. 5453 len. 12]: `` I have got to-day 's Times in my pocket . ''
Parsing [sent. 5454 len. 10]: `` I 've heard all the news already . ''
Parsing [sent. 5455 len. 14]: `` Then I think I shall only bore you if I stay . ''
Parsing [sent. 5456 len. 6]: He made me no answer .
Parsing [sent. 5457 len. 3]: I rose .
Parsing [sent. 5458 len. 30]: He just let me take his hand , and returned my good morning as if there was nothing good in the world , least of all this same morning .
Parsing [sent. 5459 len. 9]: I found the ladies in the outer room .
Parsing [sent. 5460 len. 16]: Judy was on her knees on the floor occupied with a long row of books .
Parsing [sent. 5461 len. 60]: How the books had got there I wondered ; but soon learned the secret which I had in vain asked of the butler on my first visit -- namely , how Mr Stoddart reached the volumes arranged immediately under the ceiling , in shelves , as my reader may remember , that looked like beams radiating from the centre .
Parsing [sent. 5462 len. 59]: For Judy rose from the floor , and proceeded to put in motion a mechanical arrangement concealed in one of the divisions of the book-shelves along the wall ; and I now saw that there were strong cords reaching from the ceiling , and attached to the shelf or rather long box sideways open which contained the books .
Parsing [sent. 5463 len. 11]: `` Do take care , Judy , '' said Ethelwyn .
Parsing [sent. 5464 len. 30]: `` You know it is very venturous of you to let that shelf down , when uncle is as jealous of his books as a hen of her chickens .
Parsing [sent. 5465 len. 12]: I ought n't to have let you touch the cords . ''
Parsing [sent. 5466 len. 40]: `` You could n't help it , auntie , dear ; for I had the shelf half-way down before you saw me , '' returned Judy , proceeding to raise the books to their usual position under the ceiling .
Parsing [sent. 5467 len. 47]: But in another moment , either from Judy 's awkwardness , or from the gradual decay and final fracture of some cord , down came the whole shelf with a thundering noise , and the books were scattered hither and thither in confusion about the floor .
Parsing [sent. 5468 len. 31]: Ethelwyn was gazing in dismay , and Judy had built up her face into a defiant look , when the door of the inner room opened and Mr Stoddart appeared .
Parsing [sent. 5469 len. 58]: His brow was already flushed ; but when he saw the condition of his idols , -LRB- for the lust of the eye had its full share in his regard for his books , -RRB- he broke out in a passion to which he could not have given way but for the weak state of his health .
Parsing [sent. 5470 len. 6]: `` How DARE you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5471 len. 11]: he said , with terrible emphasis on the word DARE .
Parsing [sent. 5472 len. 21]: `` Judy , I beg you will not again show yourself in my apartment till I send for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 5473 len. 26]: `` And then , '' said Judy , leaving the room , `` I am not in the least likely to be otherwise engaged . ''
Parsing [sent. 5474 len. 13]: `` I am very sorry , uncle , '' began Miss Oldcastle .
Parsing [sent. 5475 len. 13]: But Mr Stoddart had already retreated and banged the door behind him .
Parsing [sent. 5476 len. 13]: So Miss Oldcastle and I were left standing together amid the ruins .
Parsing [sent. 5477 len. 9]: She glanced at me with a distressed look .
Parsing [sent. 5478 len. 3]: I smiled .
Parsing [sent. 5479 len. 5]: She smiled in return .
Parsing [sent. 5480 len. 19]: `` I assure you , '' she said , `` uncle is not a bit like himself . ''
Parsing [sent. 5481 len. 28]: `` And I fear in trying to rouse him , I have done him no good , -- only made him more irritable , '' I said .
Parsing [sent. 5482 len. 41]: `` But he will be sorry when he comes to himself , and so we must take the reversion of his repentance now , and think nothing more of the matter than if he had already said he was sorry .
Parsing [sent. 5483 len. 25]: Besides , when books are in the case , I , for one , must not be too hard upon my unfortunate neighbour . ''
Parsing [sent. 5484 len. 7]: `` Thank you , Mr Walton .
Parsing [sent. 5485 len. 14]: I am so much obliged to you for taking my uncle 's part .
Parsing [sent. 5486 len. 16]: He has been very good to me ; and that dear Judy is provoking sometimes .
Parsing [sent. 5487 len. 35]: I am afraid I help to spoil her ; but you would hardly believe how good she really is , and what a comfort she is to me -- with all her waywardness . ''
Parsing [sent. 5488 len. 41]: `` I think I understand Judy , '' I replied ; `` and I shall be more mistaken than I am willing to confess I have ever been before , if she does not turn out a very fine woman .
Parsing [sent. 5489 len. 30]: The marvel to me is that with all the various influences amongst which she is placed here , she is not really , not seriously , spoiled after all .
Parsing [sent. 5490 len. 21]: I assure you I have the greatest regard for , as well as confidence in , my friend Judy . ''
Parsing [sent. 5491 len. 36]: Ethelwyn -- Miss Oldcastle , I should say -- gave me such a pleased look that I was well recompensed -- if justice should ever talk of recompense -- for my defence of her niece .
Parsing [sent. 5492 len. 8]: `` Will you come with me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5493 len. 16]: she said ; `` for I fear our talk may continue to annoy Mr Stoddart .
Parsing [sent. 5494 len. 18]: His hearing is acute at all times , and has been excessively so since his illness . ''
Parsing [sent. 5495 len. 18]: `` I am at your service , '' I returned , and followed her from the room .
Parsing [sent. 5496 len. 20]: `` Are you still as fond of the old quarry as you used to be , Miss Oldcastle ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5497 len. 22]: I said , as we caught a glimpse of it from the window of a long passage we were going through .
Parsing [sent. 5498 len. 6]: `` I think I am .
Parsing [sent. 5499 len. 6]: I go there most days .
Parsing [sent. 5500 len. 8]: I have not been to-day , though .
Parsing [sent. 5501 len. 8]: Would you like to go down ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5502 len. 8]: `` Very much , '' I said .
Parsing [sent. 5503 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 5504 len. 5]: I forgot , though .
Parsing [sent. 5505 len. 16]: You must not go ; it is not a fit place for an invalid . ''
Parsing [sent. 5506 len. 11]: `` I can not call myself an invalid now . ''
Parsing [sent. 5507 len. 15]: `` Your face , I am sorry to say , contradicts your words . ''
Parsing [sent. 5508 len. 20]: And she looked so kindly at me , that I almost broke out into thanks for the mere look .
Parsing [sent. 5509 len. 25]: `` And indeed , '' she went on , `` it is too damp down there , not to speak of the stairs . ''
Parsing [sent. 5510 len. 22]: By this time we had reached the little room in which I was received the first time I visited the Hall .
Parsing [sent. 5511 len. 5]: There we found Judy .
Parsing [sent. 5512 len. 19]: `` If you are not too tired already , I should like to show you my little study .
Parsing [sent. 5513 len. 22]: It has , I think , a better view than any other room in the house , '' said Miss Oldcastle .
Parsing [sent. 5514 len. 10]: `` I shall be delighted , '' I replied .
Parsing [sent. 5515 len. 10]: `` Come , Judy , '' said her aunt .
Parsing [sent. 5516 len. 14]: `` You do n't want me , I am sure , auntie . ''
Parsing [sent. 5517 len. 8]: `` I do , Judy , really .
Parsing [sent. 5518 len. 15]: You must n't be cross to us because uncle has been cross to you .
Parsing [sent. 5519 len. 29]: Uncle is not well , you know , and is n't a bit like himself ; and you know you should not have meddled with his machinery . ''
Parsing [sent. 5520 len. 13]: And Miss Oldcastle put her arm round Judy , and kissed her .
Parsing [sent. 5521 len. 26]: Whereupon Judy jumped from her seat , threw her book down , and ran to one of the several doors that opened from the room .
Parsing [sent. 5522 len. 49]: This disclosed a little staircase , almost like a ladder , only that it wound about , up which we climbed , and reached a charming little room , whose window looked down upon the Bishop 's Basin , glimmering slaty through the tops of the trees between .
Parsing [sent. 5523 len. 21]: It was panelled in small panels of dark oak , like the room below , but with more of carving .
Parsing [sent. 5524 len. 14]: Consequently it was sombre , and its sombreness was unrelieved by any mirror .
Parsing [sent. 5525 len. 10]: I gazed about me with a kind of awe .
Parsing [sent. 5526 len. 14]: I would gladly have carried away the remembrance of everything and its shadow .
Parsing [sent. 5527 len. 19]: -- Just opposite the window was a small space of brightness formed by the backs of nicely-bound books .
Parsing [sent. 5528 len. 22]: Seeing that these attracted my eye -- `` Those are almost all gifts from my uncle , '' said Miss Oldcastle .
Parsing [sent. 5529 len. 22]: `` He is really very kind , and you will not think of him as you have seen him to-day ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5530 len. 10]: `` Indeed I will not , '' I replied .
Parsing [sent. 5531 len. 8]: My eye fell upon a small pianoforte .
Parsing [sent. 5532 len. 10]: `` Do sit down , '' said Miss Oldcastle .
Parsing [sent. 5533 len. 24]: -- `` You have been very ill , and I could do nothing for you who have been so kind to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 5534 len. 11]: She spoke as if she had wanted to say this .
Parsing [sent. 5535 len. 27]: `` I only wish I had a chance of doing anything for you , '' I said , as I took a chair in the window .
Parsing [sent. 5536 len. 25]: `` But if I had done all I ever could hope to do , you have repaid me long ago , I think . ''
Parsing [sent. 5537 len. 3]: `` How ?
Parsing [sent. 5538 len. 11]: I do not know what you mean , Mr Walton .
Parsing [sent. 5539 len. 10]: I have never done you the least service . ''
Parsing [sent. 5540 len. 44]: `` Tell me first , did you play the organ in church that afternoon when -- after -- before I was taken ill -- I mean the same day you had -- a friend with you in the pew in the morning ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5541 len. 11]: I daresay my voice was as irregular as my construction .
Parsing [sent. 5542 len. 6]: I ventured just one glance .
Parsing [sent. 5543 len. 5]: Her face was flushed .
Parsing [sent. 5544 len. 7]: But she answered me at once .
Parsing [sent. 5545 len. 5]: `` I did . ''
Parsing [sent. 5546 len. 18]: `` Then I am in your debt more than you know or I can tell you . ''
Parsing [sent. 5547 len. 27]: `` Why , if that is all , I have played the organ every Sunday since uncle was taken ill , '' she said , smiling .
Parsing [sent. 5548 len. 6]: `` I know that now .
Parsing [sent. 5549 len. 20]: And I am very glad I did not know it till I was better able to bear the disappointment .
Parsing [sent. 5550 len. 17]: But it is only for what I heard that I mean now to acknowledge my obligation .
Parsing [sent. 5551 len. 20]: Tell me , Miss Oldcastle , -- what is the most precious gift one person can give another ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5552 len. 15]: She hesitated ; and I , fearing to embarrass her , answered for her .
Parsing [sent. 5553 len. 16]: `` It must be something imperishable , -- something which in its own nature IS .
Parsing [sent. 5554 len. 43]: If instead of a gem , or even of a flower , we could cast the gift of a lovely thought into the heart of a friend , that would be giving , as the angels , I suppose , must give .
Parsing [sent. 5555 len. 11]: But you did more and better for me than that .
Parsing [sent. 5556 len. 18]: I had been troubled all the morning ; and you made me know that my Redeemer liveth .
Parsing [sent. 5557 len. 16]: I did not know you were playing , mind , though I felt a difference .
Parsing [sent. 5558 len. 18]: You gave me more trust in God ; and what other gift so great could one give ?
Parsing [sent. 5559 len. 21]: I think that last impression , just as I was taken ill , must have helped me through my illness .
Parsing [sent. 5560 len. 48]: Often when I was most oppressed , ' I know that my Redeemer liveth ' would rise up in the troubled air of my mind , and sung by a voice which , though I never heard you sing , I never questioned to be yours . ''
Parsing [sent. 5561 len. 15]: She turned her face towards me : those sea-blue eyes were full of tears .
Parsing [sent. 5562 len. 26]: `` I was troubled myself , '' she said , with a faltering voice , `` when I sang -- I mean played -- that .
Parsing [sent. 5563 len. 9]: I am so glad it did somebody good !
Parsing [sent. 5564 len. 9]: I fear it did not do me much .
Parsing [sent. 5565 len. 14]: -- I will sing it to you now , if you like . ''
Parsing [sent. 5566 len. 8]: And she rose to get the music .
Parsing [sent. 5567 len. 30]: But that instant Judy , who , I then found , had left the room , bounded into it , with the exclamation , -- `` Auntie , auntie !
Parsing [sent. 5568 len. 5]: here 's grannie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5569 len. 5]: Miss Oldcastle turned pale .
Parsing [sent. 5570 len. 16]: I confess I felt embarrassed , as if I had been caught in something underhand .
Parsing [sent. 5571 len. 7]: `` Is she come in ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5572 len. 10]: asked Miss Oldcastle , trying to speak with indifference .
Parsing [sent. 5573 len. 18]: `` She is just at the door , -- must be getting out of the fly now .
Parsing [sent. 5574 len. 6]: What SHALL we do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5575 len. 9]: `` What DO you mean , Judy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5576 len. 4]: said her aunt .
Parsing [sent. 5577 len. 46]: `` Well you know , auntie , as well as I do , that grannie will look as black as a thunder-cloud to find Mr Walton here ; and if she does n't speak as loud , it will only be because she ca n't .
Parsing [sent. 5578 len. 20]: _ I _ do n't care for myself , but you know on whose head the storm will fall .
Parsing [sent. 5579 len. 11]: Do , dear Mr Walton , come down the back-stair .
Parsing [sent. 5580 len. 10]: Then she wo n't be a bit the wiser .
Parsing [sent. 5581 len. 7]: I 'll manage it all . ''
Parsing [sent. 5582 len. 43]: Here was a dilemma for me ; either to bring suffering on her , to save whom I would have borne any pain , or to creep out of the house as if I were and ought to be ashamed of myself .
Parsing [sent. 5583 len. 49]: I believe that had I been in any other relation to my fellows , I would have resolved at once to lay myself open to the peculiarly unpleasant reproach of sneaking out of the house , rather than that she should innocently suffer for my being innocently there .
Parsing [sent. 5584 len. 32]: But I was a clergyman ; and I felt , more than I had ever felt before , that therefore I could not risk ever the appearance of what was mean .
Parsing [sent. 5585 len. 16]: Miss Oldcastle , however , did not leave it to me to settle the matter .
Parsing [sent. 5586 len. 31]: All that I have just written had but flashed through my mind when she said : -- `` Judy , for shame to propose such a thing to Mr Walton !
Parsing [sent. 5587 len. 23]: I am very sorry that he may chance to have an unpleasant meeting with mamma ; but we ca n't help it .
Parsing [sent. 5588 len. 13]: Come , Judy , we will show Mr Walton out together . ''
Parsing [sent. 5589 len. 16]: `` It was n't for Mr Walton 's sake , '' returned Judy , pouting .
Parsing [sent. 5590 len. 9]: `` You are very troublesome , auntie dear .
Parsing [sent. 5591 len. 12]: Mr Walton , she is so hard to take care of !
Parsing [sent. 5592 len. 8]: and she 's worse since you came .
Parsing [sent. 5593 len. 10]: I shall have to give her up some day .
Parsing [sent. 5594 len. 19]: Do be generous , Mr Walton , and take my side -- that is , auntie 's . ''
Parsing [sent. 5595 len. 23]: `` I am afraid , Judy , I must thank your aunt for taking the part of my duty against my inclination .
Parsing [sent. 5596 len. 23]: But this kindness , at least , '' I said to Miss Oldcastle , `` I can never hope to return . ''
Parsing [sent. 5597 len. 18]: It was a stupid speech , but I could not be annoyed that I had made it .
Parsing [sent. 5598 len. 16]: `` All obligations are not burdens to be got rid of , are they ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5599 len. 42]: she replied , with a sweet smile on such a pale troubled face , that I was more moved for her , deliberately handing her over to the torture for the truth 's sake , than I care definitely to confess .
Parsing [sent. 5600 len. 21]: Thereupon , Miss Oldcastle led the way down the stairs , I followed , and Judy brought up the rear .
Parsing [sent. 5601 len. 44]: The affair was not so bad as it might have been , inasmuch as , meeting the mistress of the house in no penetralia of the same , I insisted on going out alone , and met Mrs Oldcastle in the hall only .
Parsing [sent. 5602 len. 9]: She held out no hand to greet me .
Parsing [sent. 5603 len. 17]: I bowed , and said I was sorry to find Mr Stoddart so far from well .
Parsing [sent. 5604 len. 25]: `` I fear he is far from well , '' she returned ; `` certainly in my opinion too ill to receive visitors . ''
Parsing [sent. 5605 len. 9]: So saying , she bowed and passed on .
Parsing [sent. 5606 len. 19]: I turned and walked out , not ill-pleased , as my readers will believe , with my visit .
Parsing [sent. 5607 len. 36]: From that day I recovered rapidly , and the next Sunday had the pleasure of preaching to my flock ; Mr Aikin , the gentleman already mentioned as doing duty for me , reading prayers .
Parsing [sent. 5608 len. 64]: I took for my subject one of our Lord 's miracles of healing , I forget which now , and tried to show my people that all healing and all kinds of healing come as certainly and only from His hand as those instances in which He put forth His bodily hand and touched the diseased , and told them to be whole .
Parsing [sent. 5609 len. 25]: And as they left the church the organ played , `` Comfort ye , comfort ye , my people , saith your God . ''
Parsing [sent. 5610 len. 25]: I tried hard to prevent my new feelings from so filling my mind as to make me fail of my duty towards my flock .
Parsing [sent. 5611 len. 39]: I said to myself , `` Let me be the more gentle , the more honourable , the more tender , towards these my brothers and sisters , forasmuch as they are her brothers and sisters too . ''
Parsing [sent. 5612 len. 13]: I wanted to do my work the better that I loved her .
Parsing [sent. 5613 len. 16]: Thus week after week passed , with little that I can remember worthy of record .
Parsing [sent. 5614 len. 13]: I seldom saw Miss Oldcastle , and during this period never alone .
Parsing [sent. 5615 len. 40]: True , she played the organ still , for Mr Stoddart continued too unwell to resume his ministry of sound , but I never made any attempt to see her as she came to or went from the organ-loft .
Parsing [sent. 5616 len. 47]: I felt that I ought not , or at least that it was better not , lest an interview should trouble my mind , and so interfere with my work , which , if my calling meant anything real , was a consideration of vital import .
Parsing [sent. 5617 len. 76]: But one thing I could not help noting -- that she seemed , by some intuition , to know the music I liked best ; and great help she often gave me by so uplifting my heart upon the billows of the organ-harmony , that my thinking became free and harmonious , and I spoke , as far as my own feeling was concerned , like one upheld on the unseen wings of ministering cherubim .
Parsing [sent. 5618 len. 27]: How it might be to those who heard me , or what the value of the utterance in itself might be , I can not tell .
Parsing [sent. 5619 len. 11]: I only speak of my own feelings , I say .
Parsing [sent. 5620 len. 22]: Does my reader wonder why I did not yet make any further attempt to gain favour in the lady 's eyes ?
Parsing [sent. 5621 len. 12]: He will see , if he will think for a moment .
Parsing [sent. 5622 len. 112]: First of all , I could not venture until she had seen more of me ; and how to enjoy more of her society while her mother was so unfriendly , both from instinctive dislike to me , and because of the offence I had given her more than once , I did not know ; for I feared that to call oftener might only occasion measures upon her part to prevent me from seeing her daughter at all ; and I could not tell how far such measures might expedite the event I most dreaded , or add to the discomfort to which Miss Oldcastle was already so much exposed .
Parsing [sent. 5623 len. 26]: Meantime I heard nothing of Captain Everard ; and the comfort that flowed from such a negative source was yet of a very positive character .
Parsing [sent. 5624 len. 11]: At the same time -- will my reader understand me ?
Parsing [sent. 5625 len. 30]: -- I was in some measure deterred from making further advances by the doubt whether her favour for Captain Everard might not be greater than Judy had represented it .
Parsing [sent. 5626 len. 39]: For I had always shrunk , I can hardly say with invincible dislike , for I had never tried to conquer it , from rivalry of every kind : it was , somehow , contrary to my nature .
Parsing [sent. 5627 len. 27]: Besides , Miss Oldcastle was likely to be rich some day -- apparently had money of her own even now ; and was it a weakness ?
Parsing [sent. 5628 len. 6]: was it not a weakness ?
Parsing [sent. 5629 len. 32]: -- I can not tell -- I writhed at the thought of being supposed to marry for money , and being made the object of such remarks as , `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 5630 len. 3]: you see !
Parsing [sent. 5631 len. 8]: That 's the way with the clergy !
Parsing [sent. 5632 len. 38]: They talk about poverty and faith , pretending to despise riches and to trust in God ; but just put money in their way , and what chance will a poor girl have beside a rich one !
Parsing [sent. 5633 len. 9]: It 's all very well in the pulpit .
Parsing [sent. 5634 len. 8]: It 's their business to talk so .
Parsing [sent. 5635 len. 10]: But does one of them believe what he says ?
Parsing [sent. 5636 len. 10]: or , at least , act upon it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5637 len. 47]: I think I may be a little excused for the sense of creeping cold that passed over me at the thought of such remarks as these , accompanied by compressed lips and down-drawn corners of the mouth , and reiterated nods of the head of KNOWINGNESS .
Parsing [sent. 5638 len. 33]: But I mention this only as a repressing influence , to which I certainly should not have been such a fool as to yield , had I seen the way otherwise clear .
Parsing [sent. 5639 len. 58]: For a man by showing how to use money , or rather simply by using money aright , may do more good than by refusing to possess it , if it comes to him in an entirely honourable way , that is , in such a case as mine , merely as an accident of his history .
Parsing [sent. 5640 len. 94]: But I was glad to feel pretty sure that if I should be so blessed as to marry Miss Oldcastle -- which at the time whereof I now write , seemed far too gorgeous a castle in the clouds ever to descend to the earth for me to enter it -- the POOR of my own people would be those most likely to understand my position and feelings , and least likely to impute to me worldly motives , as paltry as they are vulgar , and altogether unworthy of a true man .
Parsing [sent. 5641 len. 6]: So the time went on .
Parsing [sent. 5642 len. 19]: I called once or twice on Mr Stoddart , and found him , as I thought , better .
Parsing [sent. 5643 len. 9]: But he would not allow that he was .
Parsing [sent. 5644 len. 23]: Dr Duncan said he was better , and would be better still , if he would only believe it and exert himself .
Parsing [sent. 5645 len. 9]: He continued in the same strangely irritable humour .
Parsing [sent. 5646 len. 3]: CHAPTER XX .
Parsing [sent. 5647 len. 4]: MOOD AND WILL .
Parsing [sent. 5648 len. 4]: Winter came apace .
Parsing [sent. 5649 len. 31]: When we look towards winter from the last borders of autumn , it seems as if we could not encounter it , and as if it never would go over .
Parsing [sent. 5650 len. 34]: So does threatened trouble of any kind seem to us as we look forward upon its miry ways from the last borders of the pleasant greensward on which we have hitherto been walking .
Parsing [sent. 5651 len. 62]: But not only do both run their course , but each has its own alleviations , its own pleasures ; and very marvellously does the healthy mind fit itself to the new circumstances ; while to those who will bravely take up their burden and bear it , asking no more questions than just , `` Is this my burden ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5652 len. 13]: a thousand ministrations of nature and life will come with gentle comfortings .
Parsing [sent. 5653 len. 80]: Across a dark verdureless field will blow a wind through the heart of the winter which will wake in the patient mind not a memory merely , but a prophecy of the spring , with a glimmer of crocus , or snow-drop , or primrose ; and across the waste of tired endeavour will a gentle hope , coming he knows not whence , breathe springlike upon the heart of the man around whom life looks desolate and dreary .
Parsing [sent. 5654 len. 202]: Well do I remember a friend of mine telling me once -- he was then a labourer in the field of literature , who had not yet begun to earn his penny a day , though he worked hard -- telling me how once , when a hope that had kept him active for months was suddenly quenched -- a book refused on which he had spent a passion of labour -- the weight of money that must be paid and could not be had , pressing him down like the coffin-lid that had lately covered the ONLY friend to whom he could have applied confidently for aid -- telling me , I say , how he stood at the corner of a London street , with the rain , dripping black from the brim of his hat , the dreariest of atmospheres about him in the closing afternoon of the City , when the rich men were going home , and the poor men who worked for them were longing to follow ; and how across this waste came energy and hope into his bosom , swelling thenceforth with courage to fight , and yield no ear to suggested failure .
Parsing [sent. 5655 len. 122]: And the story would not be complete -- though it is for the fact of the arrival of unexpected and apparently unfounded HOPE that I tell it -- if I did not add , that , in the morning , his wife gave him a letter which their common trouble of yesterday had made her forget , and which had lain with its black border all night in the darkness unopened , waiting to tell him how the vanished friend had not forgotten him on her death-bed , but had left him enough to take him out of all those difficulties , and give him strength and time to do far better work than the book which had failed of birth .
Parsing [sent. 5656 len. 37]: -- Some of my readers may doubt whether I am more than `` a wandering voice , '' but whatever I am , or may be thought to be , my friend 's story is true .
Parsing [sent. 5657 len. 24]: And all this has come out of the winter that I , in the retrospect of my history , am looking forward to .
Parsing [sent. 5658 len. 70]: It came , with its fogs , and dripping boughs , and sodden paths , and rotting leaves , and rains , and skies of weary gray ; but also with its fierce red suns , shining aslant upon sheets of manna-like hoarfrost , and delicate ice-films over prisoned waters , and those white falling chaoses of perfect forms -- called snow-storms -- those confusions confounded of infinite symmetries .
Parsing [sent. 5659 len. 15]: And when the hard frost came , it brought a friend to my door .
Parsing [sent. 5660 len. 5]: It was Mr Stoddart .
Parsing [sent. 5661 len. 29]: He entered my room with something of the countenance Naaman must have borne , after his flesh had come again like unto the flesh of a little child .
Parsing [sent. 5662 len. 15]: He did not look ashamed , but his pale face looked humble and distressed .
Parsing [sent. 5663 len. 33]: Its somewhat self-satisfied placidity had vanished , and instead of the diffused geniality which was its usual expression , it now showed traces of feeling as well as plain signs of suffering .
Parsing [sent. 5664 len. 47]: I gave him as warm a welcome as I could , and having seated him comfortably by the fire , and found that he would take no refreshment , began to chat about the day 's news , for I had just been reading the newspaper .
Parsing [sent. 5665 len. 12]: But he showed no interest beyond what the merest politeness required .
Parsing [sent. 5666 len. 6]: I would try something else .
Parsing [sent. 5667 len. 31]: `` The cold weather , which makes so many invalids creep into bed , seems to have brought you out into the air , Mr Stoddart , '' I said .
Parsing [sent. 5668 len. 9]: `` It has revived me , certainly . ''
Parsing [sent. 5669 len. 25]: `` Indeed , one must believe that winter and cold are as beneficent , though not so genial , as summer and its warmth .
Parsing [sent. 5670 len. 11]: Winter kills many a disease and many a noxious influence .
Parsing [sent. 5671 len. 26]: And what is it to have the fresh green leaves of spring instead of the everlasting brown of some countries which have no winter ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5672 len. 16]: I talked thus , hoping to rouse him to conversation , and I was successful .
Parsing [sent. 5673 len. 14]: `` I feel just as if I were coming out of a winter .
Parsing [sent. 5674 len. 13]: Do n't you think illness is a kind of human winter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5675 len. 8]: `` Certainly -- more or less stormy .
Parsing [sent. 5676 len. 32]: With some a winter of snow and hail and piercing winds ; with others of black frosts and creeping fogs , with now and then a glimmer of the sun . ''
Parsing [sent. 5677 len. 8]: `` The last is more like mine .
Parsing [sent. 5678 len. 16]: I feel as if I had been in a wet hole in the earth . ''
Parsing [sent. 5679 len. 65]: `` And many a man , '' I went on , `` the foliage of whose character had been turning brown and seared and dry , rattling rather than rustling in the faint hot wind of even fortunes , has come out of the winter of a weary illness with the fresh delicate buds of a new life bursting from the sun-dried bark . ''
Parsing [sent. 5680 len. 10]: `` I wish it would be so with me .
Parsing [sent. 5681 len. 6]: I know you mean me .
Parsing [sent. 5682 len. 11]: But I do n't feel my green leaves coming . ''
Parsing [sent. 5683 len. 10]: `` Facts are not always indicated by feelings . ''
Parsing [sent. 5684 len. 15]: `` Indeed , I hope not ; nor yet feelings indicated by facts . ''
Parsing [sent. 5685 len. 9]: `` I do not quite understand you . ''
Parsing [sent. 5686 len. 11]: `` Well , Mr Walton , I will explain myself .
Parsing [sent. 5687 len. 28]: I have come to tell you how sorry and ashamed I am that I behaved so badly to you every time you came to see me . ''
Parsing [sent. 5688 len. 6]: `` Oh , nonsense ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5689 len. 3]: I said .
Parsing [sent. 5690 len. 10]: `` It was your illness , not you . ''
Parsing [sent. 5691 len. 23]: `` At least , my dear sir , the facts of my behaviour did not really represent my feelings towards you . ''
Parsing [sent. 5692 len. 10]: `` I know that as well as you do .
Parsing [sent. 5693 len. 8]: Do n't say another word about it .
Parsing [sent. 5694 len. 19]: You had the best excuse for being cross ; I should have had none for being offended . ''
Parsing [sent. 5695 len. 10]: `` It was only the outside of me . ''
Parsing [sent. 5696 len. 11]: `` Yes , yes ; I acknowledge it heartily . ''
Parsing [sent. 5697 len. 30]: `` But that does not settle the matter between me and myself , Mr Walton ; although , by your goodness , it settles it between me and you .
Parsing [sent. 5698 len. 48]: It is humiliating to think that illness should so completely ` overcrow ' me , that I am no more myself -- lose my hold , in fact , of what I call ME -- so that I am almost driven to doubt my personal identity . ''
Parsing [sent. 5699 len. 22]: `` You are fond of theories , Mr Stoddart -- perhaps a little too much so , '' `` Perhaps . ''
Parsing [sent. 5700 len. 10]: `` Will you listen to one of mine ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5701 len. 5]: `` With pleasure . ''
Parsing [sent. 5702 len. 59]: `` It seems to me sometimes -- I know it is a partial representation -- as if life were a conflict between the inner force of the spirit , which lies in its faith in the unseen -- and the outer force of the world , which lies in the pressure of everything it has to show us .
Parsing [sent. 5703 len. 49]: The material , operating upon our senses , is always asserting its existence ; and if our inner life is not equally vigorous , we shall be moved , urged , what is called actuated , from without , whereas all our activity ought to be from within .
Parsing [sent. 5704 len. 56]: But sickness not only overwhelms the mind , but , vitiating all the channels of the senses , causes them to represent things as they are not , of which misrepresentations the presence , persistency , and iteration seduce the man to act from false suggestions instead of from what he knows and believes . ''
Parsing [sent. 5705 len. 8]: `` Well , I understand all that .
Parsing [sent. 5706 len. 12]: But what use am I to make of your theory ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5707 len. 15]: `` I am delighted , Mr Stoddart , to hear you put the question .
Parsing [sent. 5708 len. 6]: That is always the point .
Parsing [sent. 5709 len. 45]: -- The inward holy garrison , that of faith , which holds by the truth , by sacred facts , and not by appearances , must be strengthened and nourished and upheld , and so enabled to resist the onset of the powers without .
Parsing [sent. 5710 len. 66]: A friend 's remonstrance may appear an unkindness -- a friend 's jest an unfeelingness -- a friend 's visit an intrusion ; nay , to come to higher things , during a mere headache it will appear as if there was no truth in the world , no reality but that of pain anywhere , and nothing to be desired but deliverance from it .
Parsing [sent. 5711 len. 60]: But all such impressions caused from without -- for , remember , the body and its innermost experiences are only OUTSIDE OF THE MAN -- have to be met by the inner confidence of the spirit , resting in God and resisting every impulse to act according to that which APPEARS TO IT instead of that which IT BELIEVES .
Parsing [sent. 5712 len. 87]: Hence , Faith is thus allegorically represented : but I had better give you Spenser 's description of her -- Here is the ` Fairy Queen ' : -- ` She was arrayed all in lily white , And in her right hand bore a cup of gold , With wine and water filled up to the height , In which a serpent did himself enfold , That horror made to all that did behold ; But she no whit did change her constant mood . '
Parsing [sent. 5713 len. 40]: This serpent stands for the dire perplexity of things about us , at which yet Faith will not blench , acting according to what she believes , and not what shows itself to her by impression and appearance . ''
Parsing [sent. 5714 len. 13]: `` I admit all that you say , '' returned Mr Stoddart .
Parsing [sent. 5715 len. 33]: `` But still the practical conclusion -- which I understand to be , that the inward garrison must be fortified -- is considerably incomplete unless we buttress it with the final HOW .
Parsing [sent. 5716 len. 7]: How is it to be fortified ?
Parsing [sent. 5717 len. 25]: For , ' I have as much of this in art as you , But yet my nature could not bear it so . '
Parsing [sent. 5718 len. 15]: -LRB- You see I read Shakespeare as well as you , Mr Walton . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 5719 len. 72]: I daresay , from a certain inclination to take the opposite side , and a certain dislike to the dogmatism of the clergy -- I speak generally -- I may have appeared to you indifferent , but I assure you that I have laboured much to withdraw my mind from the influence of money , and ambition , and pleasure , and to turn it to the contemplation of spiritual things .
Parsing [sent. 5720 len. 71]: Yet on the first attack of a depressing illness I cease to be a gentleman , I am rude to ladies who do their best and kindest to serve me , and I talk to the friend who comes to cheer and comfort me as if he were an idle vagrant who wanted to sell me a worthless book with the recommendation of the pretence that he wrote it himself .
Parsing [sent. 5721 len. 58]: Now that I am in my right mind , I am ashamed of myself , ashamed that it should be possible for me to behave so , and humiliated yet besides that I have no ground of assurance that , should my illness return to-morrow , I should not behave in the same manner the day after .
Parsing [sent. 5722 len. 10]: I want to be ALWAYS in my right mind .
Parsing [sent. 5723 len. 21]: When I am not , I know I am not , and yet yield to the appearance of being . ''
Parsing [sent. 5724 len. 22]: `` I understand perfectly what you mean , for I fancy I know a little more of illness than you do .
Parsing [sent. 5725 len. 15]: Shall I tell you where I think the fault of your self-training lies ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5726 len. 8]: `` That is just what I want .
Parsing [sent. 5727 len. 22]: The things which it pleased me to contemplate when I was well , gave me no pleasure when I was ill .
Parsing [sent. 5728 len. 6]: Nothing seemed the same . ''
Parsing [sent. 5729 len. 22]: `` If we were always in a right mood , there would be no room for the exercise of the will .
Parsing [sent. 5730 len. 10]: We should go by our mood and inclination only .
Parsing [sent. 5731 len. 7]: But that is by the by .
Parsing [sent. 5732 len. 33]: -- Where you have been wrong is -- that you have sought to influence your feelings only by thought and argument with yourself -- and not also by contact with your fellows .
Parsing [sent. 5733 len. 22]: Besides the ladies of whom you have spoken , I think you have hardly a friend in this neighbourhood but myself .
Parsing [sent. 5734 len. 21]: One friend can not afford you half experience enough to teach you the relations of life and of human needs .
Parsing [sent. 5735 len. 23]: At best , under such circumstances , you can only have right theories : practice for realising them in yourself is nowhere .
Parsing [sent. 5736 len. 70]: It is no more possible for a man in the present day to retire from his fellows into the cave of his religion , and thereby leave the world of his own faults and follies behind , than it was possible for the eremites of old to get close to God in virtue of declining the duties which their very birth of human father and mother laid upon them .
Parsing [sent. 5737 len. 55]: I do not deny that you and the eremite may both come NEARER to God , in virtue of whatever is true in your desires and your worship ; ` but if a man love not his brother whom he hath seen , how can he love God whom he hath not seen ? '
Parsing [sent. 5738 len. 21]: -- which surely means to imply at least that to love our neighbour is a great help towards loving God .
Parsing [sent. 5739 len. 15]: How this love is to come about without intercourse , I do not see .
Parsing [sent. 5740 len. 39]: And how without this love we are to bear up from within against the thousand irritations to which , especially in sickness , our unavoidable relations with humanity will expose us , I can not tell either . ''
Parsing [sent. 5741 len. 25]: `` But , '' returned Mr Stoddart , `` I had had a true regard for you , and some friendly communication with you .
Parsing [sent. 5742 len. 31]: If human intercourse were what is required in my case , how should I fail just with respect to the only man with whom I had held such intercourse ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5743 len. 21]: `` Because the relations in which you stood with me were those of the individual , not of the race .
Parsing [sent. 5744 len. 54]: You like me , because I am fortunate enough to please you -- to be a gentleman , I hope -- to be a man of some education , and capable of understanding , or at least docile enough to try to understand , what you tell me of your plans and pursuits .
Parsing [sent. 5745 len. 28]: But you do not feel any relation to me on the ground of my humanity -- that God made me , and therefore I am your brother .
Parsing [sent. 5746 len. 29]: It is not because we grow out of the same stem , but merely because my leaf is a little like your own that you draw to me .
Parsing [sent. 5747 len. 18]: Our Lord took on Him the nature of man : you will only regard your individual attractions .
Parsing [sent. 5748 len. 9]: Disturb your liking and your love vanishes . ''
Parsing [sent. 5749 len. 6]: `` You are severe . ''
Parsing [sent. 5750 len. 14]: `` I do n't mean really vanishes , but disappears for the time .
Parsing [sent. 5751 len. 30]: Yet you will confess you have to wait till , somehow , you know not how , it comes back again -- of itself , as it were . ''
Parsing [sent. 5752 len. 6]: `` Yes , I confess .
Parsing [sent. 5753 len. 10]: To my sorrow , I find it so . ''
Parsing [sent. 5754 len. 11]: `` Let me tell you the truth , Mr Stoddart .
Parsing [sent. 5755 len. 17]: You seem to me to have been hitherto only a dilettante or amateur in spiritual matters .
Parsing [sent. 5756 len. 8]: Do not imagine I mean a hypocrite .
Parsing [sent. 5757 len. 5]: Very far from it .
Parsing [sent. 5758 len. 18]: The word amateur itself suggests a real interest , though it may be of a superficial nature .
Parsing [sent. 5759 len. 9]: But in religion one must be all there .
Parsing [sent. 5760 len. 29]: You seem to me to have taken much interest in unusual forms of theory , and in mystical speculations , to which in themselves I make no objection .
Parsing [sent. 5761 len. 75]: But to be content with those , instead of knowing God himself , or to substitute a general amateur friendship towards the race for the love of your neighbour , is a mockery which will always manifest itself to an honest mind like yours in such failure and disappointment in your own character as you are now lamenting , if not indeed in some mode far more alarming , because gross and terrible . ''
Parsing [sent. 5762 len. 24]: `` Am I to understand you , then , that intercourse with one 's neighbours ought to take the place of meditation ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5763 len. 40]: `` By no means : but ought to go side by side with it , if you would have at once a healthy mind to judge and the means of either verifying your speculations or discovering their falsehood . ''
Parsing [sent. 5764 len. 19]: `` But where am I to find such friends besides yourself with whom to hold spiritual communion ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5765 len. 60]: `` It is the communion of spiritual deeds , deeds of justice , of mercy , of humility -- the kind word , the cup of cold water , the visitation in sickness , the lending of money -- not spiritual conference or talk , that I mean : the latter will come of itself where it is natural .
Parsing [sent. 5766 len. 55]: You would soon find that it is not only to those whose spiritual windows are of the same shape as your own that you are neighbour : there is one poor man in my congregation who knows more -- practically , I mean , too -- of spirituality of mind than any of us .
Parsing [sent. 5767 len. 14]: Perhaps you could not teach him much , but he could teach you .
Parsing [sent. 5768 len. 13]: At all events , our neighbours are just those round about us .
Parsing [sent. 5769 len. 61]: And the most ignorant man in a little place like Marshmallows , one like you with leisure ought to know and understand , and have some good influence upon : he is your brother whom you are bound to care for and elevate -- I do not mean socially , but really , in himself -- if it be possible .
Parsing [sent. 5770 len. 79]: You ought at least to get into some simple human relation with him , as you would with the youngest and most ignorant of your brothers and sisters born of the same father and mother ; approaching him , not with pompous lecturing or fault-finding , still less with that abomination called condescension , but with the humble service of the elder to the younger , in whatever he may be helped by you without injury to him .
Parsing [sent. 5771 len. 25]: Never was there a more injurious mistake than that it is the business of the clergy only to have the care of souls . ''
Parsing [sent. 5772 len. 7]: `` But that would be endless .
Parsing [sent. 5773 len. 10]: It would leave me no time for myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 5774 len. 66]: `` Would that be no time for yourself spent in leading a noble , Christian life ; in verifying the words of our Lord by doing them ; in building your house on the rock of action instead of the sands of theory ; in widening your own being by entering into the nature , thoughts , feelings , even fancies of those around you ?
Parsing [sent. 5775 len. 58]: In such intercourse you would find health radiating into your own bosom ; healing sympathies springing up in the most barren acquaintance ; channels opened for the in-rush of truth into your own mind ; and opportunities afforded for the exercise of that self-discipline , the lack of which led to the failures which you now bemoan .
Parsing [sent. 5776 len. 67]: Soon then would you have cause to wonder how much some of your speculations had fallen into the background , simply because the truth , showing itself grandly true , had so filled and occupied your mind that it left no room for anxiety about such questions as , while secured in the interest all reality gives , were yet dwarfed by the side of it .
Parsing [sent. 5777 len. 129]: Nothing , I repeat , so much as humble ministration to your neighbours , will help you to that perfect love of God which casteth out fear ; nothing but the love of God -- that God revealed in Christ -- will make you able to love your neighbour aright ; and the Spirit of God , which alone gives might for any good , will by these loves , which are life , strengthen you at last to believe in the light even in the midst of darkness ; to hold the resolution formed in health when sickness has altered the appearance of everything around you ; and to feel tenderly towards your fellow , even when you yourself are plunged in dejection or racked with pain .
Parsing [sent. 5778 len. 28]: -- But , '' I said , `` I fear I have transgressed the bounds of all propriety by enlarging upon this matter as I have done .
Parsing [sent. 5779 len. 19]: I can only say I have spoken in proportion to my feeling of its weight and truth . ''
Parsing [sent. 5780 len. 14]: `` I thank you , heartily , '' returned Mr Stoddart , rising .
Parsing [sent. 5781 len. 31]: `` And I promise you at least to think over what you have been saying -- I hope to be in my old place in the organ-loft next Sunday . ''
Parsing [sent. 5782 len. 4]: So he was .
Parsing [sent. 5783 len. 11]: And Miss Oldcastle was in the pew with her mother .
Parsing [sent. 5784 len. 11]: Nor did she go any more to Addicehead to church .
Parsing [sent. 5785 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXI .
Parsing [sent. 5786 len. 6]: THE DEVIL IN THOMAS WEIR .
Parsing [sent. 5787 len. 21]: As the winter went on , it was sad to look on the evident though slow decline of Catherine Weir .
Parsing [sent. 5788 len. 24]: It seemed as if the dead season was dragging her to its bosom , to lay her among the leaves of past summers .
Parsing [sent. 5789 len. 45]: She was still to be found in the shop , or appeared in it as often as the bell suspended over the door rang to announce the entrance of a customer ; but she was terribly worn , and her step indicated much weakness .
Parsing [sent. 5790 len. 15]: Nor had the signs of restless trouble diminished as these tide-marks indicated ebbing strength .
Parsing [sent. 5791 len. 32]: There was the same dry fierce fire in her eyes ; the same forceful compression of her lips ; the same evidences of brooding over some one absorbing thought or feeling .
Parsing [sent. 5792 len. 18]: She seemed to me , and to Dr Duncan as well , to be dying of resentment .
Parsing [sent. 5793 len. 7]: Would nobody do anything for her ?
Parsing [sent. 5794 len. 3]: I thought .
Parsing [sent. 5795 len. 7]: Would not her father help her ?
Parsing [sent. 5796 len. 86]: He had got more gentle now ; whence I had reason to hope that Christian principles and feelings had begun to rise and operate in him ; while surely the influence of his son must , by this time , have done something not only to soften his character generally , but to appease the anger he had cherished towards the one ewe-lamb , against which , having wandered away into the desert place , he had closed and barred the door of the sheep-fold .
Parsing [sent. 5797 len. 16]: I would go and see him , and try what could be done for her .
Parsing [sent. 5798 len. 58]: I may be forgiven here if I make the remark that I can not help thinking that what measure of success I had already had with my people , was partly owing to this , that when I thought of a thing and had concluded it might do , I very seldom put off the consequent action .
Parsing [sent. 5799 len. 43]: I found I was wrong sometimes , and that the particular action did no good ; but thus movement was kept up in my operative nature , preventing it from sinking towards the inactivity to which I was but too much inclined .
Parsing [sent. 5800 len. 20]: Besides , to find out what will not do , is a step towards finding out what will do .
Parsing [sent. 5801 len. 18]: Moreover , an attempt in itself unsuccessful may set something or other in motion that will help .
Parsing [sent. 5802 len. 24]: My present attempt turned out one of my failures , though I can not think that it would have been better left unmade .
Parsing [sent. 5803 len. 49]: A red rayless sun , which one might have imagined sullen and disconsolate because he could not make the dead earth smile into flowers , was looking through the frosty fog of the winter morning as I walked across the bridge to find Thomas Weir in his workshop .
Parsing [sent. 5804 len. 27]: The poplars stood like goblin sentinels , with black heads , upon which the long hair stood on end , all along the dark cold river .
Parsing [sent. 5805 len. 13]: Nature looked like a life out of which the love has vanished .
Parsing [sent. 5806 len. 8]: I turned from it and hastened on .
Parsing [sent. 5807 len. 14]: Thomas was busy working with a spoke-sheave at the spoke of a cart-wheel .
Parsing [sent. 5808 len. 34]: How curiously the smallest visual fact will sometimes keep its place in the memory , when it can not with all earnestness of endeavour recall a thought -- a far more important fact !
Parsing [sent. 5809 len. 11]: That will come again only when its time comes first .
Parsing [sent. 5810 len. 14]: `` A cold morning , Thomas , '' I called from the door .
Parsing [sent. 5811 len. 16]: `` I can always keep myself warm , sir , '' returned Thomas , cheerfully .
Parsing [sent. 5812 len. 9]: `` What are you doing , Tom ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5813 len. 9]: I said , going up to him first .
Parsing [sent. 5814 len. 9]: `` A little job for myself , sir .
Parsing [sent. 5815 len. 8]: I 'm making a few bookshelves . ''
Parsing [sent. 5816 len. 12]: `` I want to have a little talk with your father .
Parsing [sent. 5817 len. 16]: Just step out in a minute or so , and let me have half-an-hour . ''
Parsing [sent. 5818 len. 8]: `` Yes , sir , certainly . ''
Parsing [sent. 5819 len. 54]: I then went to the other end of the shop , for , curiously , as it seemed to me , although father and son were on the best of terms , they always worked as far from each other as the shop would permit , and it was a very large room .
Parsing [sent. 5820 len. 19]: `` It is not easy always to keep warm through and through , Thomas , '' I said .
Parsing [sent. 5821 len. 20]: I suppose my tone revealed to his quick perceptions that `` more was meant than met the ear . ''
Parsing [sent. 5822 len. 15]: He looked up from his work , his tool filled with an uncompleted shaving .
Parsing [sent. 5823 len. 21]: `` And when the heart gets cold , '' I went on , `` it is not easily warmed again .
Parsing [sent. 5824 len. 11]: The fire 's hard to light there , Thomas . ''
Parsing [sent. 5825 len. 20]: Still he looked at me , stooping over his work , apparently with a presentiment of what was coming .
Parsing [sent. 5826 len. 19]: `` I fear there is no way of lighting it again , except the blacksmith 's way . ''
Parsing [sent. 5827 len. 15]: `` Hammering the iron till it is red-hot , you mean , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5828 len. 4]: `` I do .
Parsing [sent. 5829 len. 29]: When a man 's heart has grown cold , the blows of affliction must fall thick and heavy before the fire can be got that will light it .
Parsing [sent. 5830 len. 12]: -- When did you see your daughter Catherine , Thomas ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5831 len. 15]: His head dropped , and he began to work as if for bare life .
Parsing [sent. 5832 len. 28]: Not a word came from the form now bent over his tool as if he had never lifted himself up since he first began in the morning .
Parsing [sent. 5833 len. 31]: I could just see that his face was deadly pale , and his lips compressed like those of one of the violent who take the kingdom of heaven by force .
Parsing [sent. 5834 len. 15]: But it was for no such agony of effort that his were thus closed .
Parsing [sent. 5835 len. 18]: He went on working till the silence became so lengthened that it seemed settled into the endless .
Parsing [sent. 5836 len. 4]: I felt embarrassed .
Parsing [sent. 5837 len. 14]: To break a silence is sometimes as hard as to break a spell .
Parsing [sent. 5838 len. 24]: What Thomas would have done or said if he had not had this safety-valve of bodily exertion , I can not even imagine .
Parsing [sent. 5839 len. 32]: `` Thomas , '' I said , at length , laying my hand on his shoulder , `` you are not going to part company with me , I hope ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5840 len. 10]: `` You drive a man too far , sir .
Parsing [sent. 5841 len. 31]: I 've given in more to you than ever I did to man , sir ; and I do n't know that I ought n't to be ashamed of it .
Parsing [sent. 5842 len. 9]: But you do n't know where to stop .
Parsing [sent. 5843 len. 17]: If we lived a thousand years you would be driving a man on to the last .
Parsing [sent. 5844 len. 10]: And there 's no good in that , sir .
Parsing [sent. 5845 len. 9]: A man must be at peace somewhen . ''
Parsing [sent. 5846 len. 17]: `` The question is , Thomas , whether I would be driving you ON or BACK .
Parsing [sent. 5847 len. 10]: You and I too MUST go on or back .
Parsing [sent. 5848 len. 15]: I want to go on myself , and to make you go on too .
Parsing [sent. 5849 len. 14]: I do n't want to be parted from you now or then . ''
Parsing [sent. 5850 len. 34]: `` That 's all very well , sir , and very kind , I do n't doubt ; but , as I said afore , a man must be at peace SOMEWHEN . ''
Parsing [sent. 5851 len. 16]: `` That 's what I want so much that I want you to go on .
Parsing [sent. 5852 len. 2]: Peace !
Parsing [sent. 5853 len. 18]: I trust in God we shall both have it one day , SOMEWHEN , as you say .
Parsing [sent. 5854 len. 16]: Have you got this peace so plentifully now that you are satisfied as you are ?
Parsing [sent. 5855 len. 11]: You will never get it but by going on . ''
Parsing [sent. 5856 len. 15]: `` I do not think there is any good got in stirring a puddle .
Parsing [sent. 5857 len. 5]: Let by-gones be by-gones .
Parsing [sent. 5858 len. 19]: You make a mistake , sir , in rousing an anger which I would willingly let sleep . ''
Parsing [sent. 5859 len. 32]: `` Better a wakeful anger , and a wakeful conscience with it , than an anger sunk into indifference , and a sleeping dog of a conscience that will not bark .
Parsing [sent. 5860 len. 15]: To have ceased to be angry is not one step nearer to your daughter .
Parsing [sent. 5861 len. 16]: Better strike her , abuse her , with the chance of a kiss to follow .
Parsing [sent. 5862 len. 13]: Ah , Thomas , you are like Jonas with his gourd . ''
Parsing [sent. 5863 len. 14]: `` I do n't see what that has to do with it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5864 len. 6]: `` I will tell you .
Parsing [sent. 5865 len. 12]: You are fierce in wrath at the disgrace to your family .
Parsing [sent. 5866 len. 7]: Your pride is up in arms .
Parsing [sent. 5867 len. 32]: You do n't care for the misery of your daughter , who , the more wrong she has done , is the more to be pitied by a father 's heart .
Parsing [sent. 5868 len. 13]: Your pride , I say , is all that you care about .
Parsing [sent. 5869 len. 45]: The wrong your daughter has done , you care nothing about ; or you would have taken her to your arms years ago , in the hope that the fervour of your love would drive the devil out of her and make her repent .
Parsing [sent. 5870 len. 15]: I say it is not the wrong , but the disgrace you care for .
Parsing [sent. 5871 len. 21]: The gourd of your pride is withered , and yet you will water it with your daughter 's misery . ''
Parsing [sent. 5872 len. 24]: `` Go out of my shop , '' he cried ; `` or I may say what I should be sorry for . ''
Parsing [sent. 5873 len. 8]: I turned at once and left him .
Parsing [sent. 5874 len. 18]: I found young Tom round the corner , leaning against the wall , and reading his Virgil .
Parsing [sent. 5875 len. 19]: `` Do n't speak to your father , Tom , '' I said , `` for a while .
Parsing [sent. 5876 len. 8]: I 've put him out of temper .
Parsing [sent. 5877 len. 8]: He will be best left alone . ''
Parsing [sent. 5878 len. 4]: He looked frightened .
Parsing [sent. 5879 len. 12]: `` There 's no harm done , Tom , my boy .
Parsing [sent. 5880 len. 10]: I 've been talking to him about your sister .
Parsing [sent. 5881 len. 15]: He must have time to think over what I have said to him . ''
Parsing [sent. 5882 len. 10]: `` I see , sir ; I see . ''
Parsing [sent. 5883 len. 11]: `` Be as attentive to him as you can . ''
Parsing [sent. 5884 len. 7]: `` I will , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 5885 len. 37]: It was not alone resentment at my interference that had thus put the poor fellow beside himself , I was certain : I had called up all the old misery -- set the wound bleeding again .
Parsing [sent. 5886 len. 12]: Shame was once more wide awake and tearing at his heart .
Parsing [sent. 5887 len. 8]: That HIS daughter should have done so !
Parsing [sent. 5888 len. 7]: For she had been his pride .
Parsing [sent. 5889 len. 43]: She had been the belle of the village , and very lovely ; but having been apprenticed to a dressmaker in Addicehead , had , after being there about a year and a half , returned home , apparently in a decline .
Parsing [sent. 5890 len. 32]: After the birth of her child , however , she had , to her own disappointment , and no doubt to that of her father as well , begun to recover .
Parsing [sent. 5891 len. 23]: What a time of wretchedness it must have been to both of them until she left his house , one can imagine .
Parsing [sent. 5892 len. 50]: Most likely the misery of the father vented itself in greater unkindness than he felt , which , sinking into the proud nature she had derived from him , roused such a resentment as rarely if ever can be thoroughly appeased until Death comes in to help the reconciliation .
Parsing [sent. 5893 len. 31]: How often has an old love blazed up again under the blowing of his cold breath , and sent the spirit warm at heart into the regions of the unknown !
Parsing [sent. 5894 len. 21]: She never would utter a word to reveal the name or condition of him by whom she had been wronged .
Parsing [sent. 5895 len. 89]: To his child , as long as he drew his life from her , she behaved with strange alternations of dislike and passionate affection ; after which season the latter began to diminish in violence , and the former to become more fixed , till at length , by the time I had made their acquaintance , her feelings seemed to have settled into what would have been indifference but for the constant reminder of her shame and her wrong together , which his very presence necessarily was .
Parsing [sent. 5896 len. 69]: They were not only the gossips of the village who judged that the fact of Addicehead 's being a garrison town had something to do with the fate that had befallen her ; a fate by which , in its very spring-time , when its flowers were loveliest , and hope was strongest for its summer , her life was changed into the dreary wind-swept , rain-sodden moor .
Parsing [sent. 5897 len. 50]: The man who can ACCEPT such a sacrifice from a woman , -- I say nothing of WILING it from her -- is , in his meanness , selfishness , and dishonour , contemptible as the Pharisee who , with his long prayers , devours the widow 's house .
Parsing [sent. 5898 len. 11]: He leaves her desolate , while he walks off free .
Parsing [sent. 5899 len. 69]: Would to God a man like the great-hearted , pure-bodied Milton , a man whom young men are compelled to respect , would in this our age , utter such a word as , making `` mad the guilty , '' if such grace might be accorded them , would `` appal the free , '' lest they too should fall into such a mire of selfish dishonour !
Parsing [sent. 5900 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXII .
Parsing [sent. 5901 len. 6]: THE DEVIL IN CATHERINE WEIR .
Parsing [sent. 5902 len. 16]: About this time my father was taken ill , and several journeys to London followed .
Parsing [sent. 5903 len. 90]: It is only as vicar that I am writing these memorials -- for such they should be called , rather than ANNALS , though certainly the use of the latter word has of late become vague enough for all convenience -- therefore I have said nothing about my home-relations ; but I must just mention here that I had a half-sister , about half my own age , whose anxiety during my father 's illness rendered my visits more frequent than perhaps they would have been from my own .
Parsing [sent. 5904 len. 9]: But my sister was right in her anxiety .
Parsing [sent. 5905 len. 11]: My father grew worse , and in December he died .
Parsing [sent. 5906 len. 10]: I will not eulogize one so dear to me .
Parsing [sent. 5907 len. 79]: That he was no common man will appear from the fact of his unconventionality and justice in leaving his property to my sister , saying in his will that he had done all I could require of him , in giving me a good education ; and that , men having means in their power which women had not , it was unjust to the latter to make them , without a choice , dependent upon the former .
Parsing [sent. 5908 len. 26]: After the funeral , my sister , feeling it impossible to remain in the house any longer , begged me to take her with me .
Parsing [sent. 5909 len. 19]: So , after arranging affairs , we set out , and reached Marshmallows on New Year 's Day .
Parsing [sent. 5910 len. 22]: My sister being so much younger than myself , her presence in my house made very little change in my habits .
Parsing [sent. 5911 len. 24]: She came into my ways without any difficulty , so that I did not experience the least restraint from having to consider her .
Parsing [sent. 5912 len. 37]: And I soon began to find her of considerable service among the poor and sick of my flock , the latter class being more numerous this winter on account of the greater severity of the weather .
Parsing [sent. 5913 len. 14]: I now began to note a change in the habits of Catherine Weir .
Parsing [sent. 5914 len. 37]: As far as I remember , I had never up to this time seen her out of her own house , except in church , at which she had been a regular attendant for many weeks .
Parsing [sent. 5915 len. 36]: Now , however , I began to meet her when and where I least expected -- I do not say often , but so often as to make me believe she went wandering about frequently .
Parsing [sent. 5916 len. 14]: It was always at night , however , and always in stormy weather .
Parsing [sent. 5917 len. 39]: The marvel was , not that a sick woman could be there -- for a sick woman may be able to do anything ; but that she could do so more than once -- that was the marvel .
Parsing [sent. 5918 len. 13]: At the same time , I began to miss her from church .
Parsing [sent. 5919 len. 26]: Possibly my reader may wonder how I came to have the chance of meeting any one again and again at night and in stormy weather .
Parsing [sent. 5920 len. 8]: I can relieve him from the difficulty .
Parsing [sent. 5921 len. 18]: Odd as it will appear to some readers , I had naturally a predilection for rough weather .
Parsing [sent. 5922 len. 24]: I think I enjoyed fighting with a storm in winter nearly as much as lying on the grass under a beech-tree in summer .
Parsing [sent. 5923 len. 19]: Possibly this assertion may seem strange to one likewise who has remarked the ordinary peaceableness of my disposition .
Parsing [sent. 5924 len. 60]: But he may have done me the justice to remark at the same time , that I have some considerable pleasure in fighting the devil , though none in fighting my fellow-man , even in the ordinary form of disputation in which it is not heart 's blood , but soul 's blood , that is so often shed .
Parsing [sent. 5925 len. 24]: Indeed there are many controversies far more immoral , as to the manner in which they are conducted , than a brutal prize-fight .
Parsing [sent. 5926 len. 48]: There is , however , a pleasure of its own in conflict ; and I have always experienced a certain indescribable , though I believe not at all unusual exaltation , even in struggling with a well-set , thoroughly roused storm of wind and snow or rain .
Parsing [sent. 5927 len. 27]: The sources of this by no means unusual delight , I will not stay to examine , indicating only that I believe the sources are deep .
Parsing [sent. 5928 len. 29]: -- I was now quite well , and had no reason to fear bad consequences from the indulgence of this surely innocent form of the love of strife .
Parsing [sent. 5929 len. 21]: But I find I must give another reason as well , if I would be thoroughly honest with my reader .
Parsing [sent. 5930 len. 22]: The fact was , that as I had recovered strength , I had become more troubled and restless about Miss Oldcastle .
Parsing [sent. 5931 len. 15]: I could not see how I was to make any progress towards her favour .
Parsing [sent. 5932 len. 13]: There seemed a barrier as insurmountable as intangible between her and me .
Parsing [sent. 5933 len. 38]: The will of one woman came between and parted us , and that will was as the magic line over which no effort of will or strength could enable the enchanted knight to make a single stride .
Parsing [sent. 5934 len. 58]: And this consciousness of being fettered by insensible and infrangible bonds , this need of doing something with nothing tangible in the reach of the outstretched hand , so worked upon my mind , that it naturally sought relief , as often as the elemental strife arose , by mingling unconstrained with the tumult of the night .
Parsing [sent. 5935 len. 38]: -- Will my readers find it hard to believe that this disquietude of mind should gradually sink away as the hours of Saturday glided down into night , and the day of my best labour drew nigh ?
Parsing [sent. 5936 len. 27]: Or will they answer , `` We believe it easily ; for then you could at least see the lady , and that comforted you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5937 len. 18]: Whatever it was that quieted me , not the less have I to thank God for it .
Parsing [sent. 5938 len. 7]: All might have been so different .
Parsing [sent. 5939 len. 38]: What a fearful thing would it have been for me to have found my mind so full of my own cares , that I was unable to do God 's work and bear my neighbour 's burden !
Parsing [sent. 5940 len. 26]: But even then I would have cried to Him , and said , `` I know Thee that Thou art NOT a hard master . ''
Parsing [sent. 5941 len. 76]: Now , however , that I have quite accounted , as I believe , by the peculiarity both of my disposition and circumstances , for unusual wanderings under conditions when most people consider themselves fortunate within doors , I must return to Catherine Weir , the eccentricity of whose late behaviour , being in the particulars discussed identical with that of mine , led to the necessity for the explanation of my habits given above .
Parsing [sent. 5942 len. 83]: One January afternoon , just as twilight was folding her gray cloak about her , and vanishing in the night , the wind blowing hard from the south-west , melting the snow under foot , and sorely disturbing the dignity of the one grand old cedar which stood before my study window , and now filled my room with the great sweeps of its moaning , I felt as if the elements were calling me , and rose to obey the summons .
Parsing [sent. 5943 len. 26]: My sister was , by this time , so accustomed to my going out in all weathers , that she troubled me with no expostulation .
Parsing [sent. 5944 len. 13]: My spirits began to rise the moment I was in the wind .
Parsing [sent. 5945 len. 36]: Keen , and cold , and unsparing , it swept through the leafless branches around me , with a different hiss for every tree that bent , and swayed , and tossed in its torrent .
Parsing [sent. 5946 len. 84]: I made my way to the gate and out upon the road , and then , turning to the right , away from the village , I sought a kind of common , open and treeless , the nearest approach to a moor that there was in the county , I believe , over which a wind like this would sweep unstayed by house , or shrub , or fence , the only shelter it afforded lying in the inequalities of its surface .
Parsing [sent. 5947 len. 95]: I had walked with my head bent low against the blast , for the better part of a mile , fighting for every step of the way , when , coming to a deep cut in the common , opening at right angles from the road , whence at some time or other a large quantity of sand had been carted , I turned into its defence to recover my breath , and listen to the noise of the wind in the fierce rush of its sea over the open channel of the common .
Parsing [sent. 5948 len. 54]: And I remember I was thinking with myself : `` If the air would only become faintly visible for a moment , what a sight it would be of waste grandeur with its thousands of billowing eddies , and self-involved , conflicting , and swallowing whirlpools from the sea-bottom of this common ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5949 len. 41]: when , with my imagination resting on the fancied vision , I was startled by such a moan as seemed about to break into a storm of passionate cries , but was followed by the words : `` O God !
Parsing [sent. 5950 len. 7]: I can not bear it longer .
Parsing [sent. 5951 len. 8]: Hast thou NO help for me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5952 len. 20]: Instinctively almost I knew that Catherine Weir was beside me , though I could not see where she was .
Parsing [sent. 5953 len. 64]: In a moment more , however , I thought I could distinguish through the darkness -- imagination no doubt filling up the truth of its form -- a figure crouching in such an attitude of abandoned despair as recalled one of Flaxman 's outlines , the body bent forward over the drawn-up knees , and the face thus hidden even from the darkness .
Parsing [sent. 5954 len. 27]: I could not help saying to myself , as I took a step or two towards her , `` What is thy trouble to hers ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5955 len. 47]: I may here remark that I had come to the conclusion , from pondering over her case , that until a yet deeper and bitterer resentment than that which she bore to her father was removed , it would be of no use attacking the latter .
Parsing [sent. 5956 len. 59]: For the former kept her in a state of hostility towards her whole race : with herself at war she had no gentle thoughts , no love for her kind ; but ever `` She fed her wound with fresh-renewed bale '' from every hurt that she received from or imagined to be offered her by anything human .
Parsing [sent. 5957 len. 45]: So I had resolved that the next time I had an opportunity of speaking to her , I would make an attempt to probe the evil to its root , though I had but little hope , I confess , of doing any good .
Parsing [sent. 5958 len. 17]: And now when I heard her say , `` Hast thou NO help for me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5959 len. 20]: I went near her with the words : `` God has , indeed , help for His own offspring .
Parsing [sent. 5960 len. 9]: Has He not suffered that He might help ?
Parsing [sent. 5961 len. 8]: But you have not yet forgiven . ''
Parsing [sent. 5962 len. 23]: When I began to speak , she gave a slight start : she was far too miserable to be terrified at anything .
Parsing [sent. 5963 len. 28]: Before I had finished , she stood erect on her feet , facing me with the whiteness of her face glimmering through the blackness of the night .
Parsing [sent. 5964 len. 20]: `` I ask Him for peace , '' she said , `` and He sends me more torment . ''
Parsing [sent. 5965 len. 20]: And I thought of Ahab when he said , `` Hast thou found me , O mine enemy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5966 len. 26]: `` If we had what we asked for always , we should too often find it was not what we wanted , after all . ''
Parsing [sent. 5967 len. 12]: `` You will not leave me alone , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 5968 len. 7]: `` It is too bad . ''
Parsing [sent. 5969 len. 3]: Poor woman !
Parsing [sent. 5970 len. 25]: It was well for her she could pray to God in her trouble ; for she could scarcely endure a word from her fellow-man .
Parsing [sent. 5971 len. 44]: She , despairing before God , was fierce as a tigress to her fellow-sinner who would stretch a hand to help her out of the mire , and set her beside him on the rock which he felt firm under his own feet .
Parsing [sent. 5972 len. 31]: `` I will not leave you alone , Catherine , '' I said , feeling that I must at length assume another tone of speech with her who resisted gentleness .
Parsing [sent. 5973 len. 23]: `` Scorn my interference as you will , '' I said , `` I have yet to give an account of you .
Parsing [sent. 5974 len. 16]: And I have to fear lest my Master should require your blood at my hands .
Parsing [sent. 5975 len. 26]: I did not follow you here , you may well believe me ; but I have found you here , and I must speak . ''
Parsing [sent. 5976 len. 9]: All this time the wind was roaring overhead .
Parsing [sent. 5977 len. 32]: But in the hollow was stillness , and I was so near her , that I could hear every word she said , although she spoke in a low compressed tone .
Parsing [sent. 5978 len. 20]: `` Have you a right to persecute me , '' she said , `` because I am unhappy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5979 len. 26]: `` I have a right , and , more than a right , I have a duty to aid your better self against your worse .
Parsing [sent. 5980 len. 13]: You , I fear , are siding with your worse self . ''
Parsing [sent. 5981 len. 6]: `` You judge me hard .
Parsing [sent. 5982 len. 24]: I have had wrongs that -- '' And here she stopped in a way that let me know she WOULD say no more .
Parsing [sent. 5983 len. 19]: `` That you have had wrongs , and bitter wrongs , I do not for a moment doubt .
Parsing [sent. 5984 len. 15]: And him who has done you most wrong , you will not forgive . ''
Parsing [sent. 5985 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 5986 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 5987 len. 51]: Not even for the sake of Him who , hanging on the tree , after all the bitterness of blows and whipping , and derision , and rudest gestures and taunts , even when the faintness of death was upon Him , cried to His Father to forgive their cruelty .
Parsing [sent. 5988 len. 21]: He asks you to forgive the man who wronged you , and you will not -- not even for Him !
Parsing [sent. 5989 len. 7]: Oh , Catherine , Catherine ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5990 len. 20]: `` It is very easy to talk , Mr Walton , '' she returned with forced but cool scorn .
Parsing [sent. 5991 len. 18]: `` Tell me , then , '' I said , `` have YOU nothing to repent of ?
Parsing [sent. 5992 len. 12]: Have YOU done no wrong in this same miserable matter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5993 len. 35]: `` I do not understand you , sir , '' she said , freezingly , petulantly , not sure , perhaps , or unwilling to believe , that I meant what I did mean .
Parsing [sent. 5994 len. 11]: I was fully resolved to be plain with her now .
Parsing [sent. 5995 len. 24]: `` Catherine Weir , '' I said , `` did not God give you a house to keep fair and pure for Him ?
Parsing [sent. 5996 len. 7]: Did you keep it such ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5997 len. 31]: `` He told me lies , '' she cried fiercely , with a cry that seemed to pierce through the storm over our heads , up towards the everlasting justice .
Parsing [sent. 5998 len. 8]: `` He lied , and I trusted .
Parsing [sent. 5999 len. 14]: For his sake I sinned , and he threw me from him . ''
Parsing [sent. 6000 len. 11]: `` You gave him what was not yours to give .
Parsing [sent. 6001 len. 12]: What right had you to cast your pearl before a swine ?
Parsing [sent. 6002 len. 14]: But dare you say it was ALL FOR HIS SAKE you did it ?
Parsing [sent. 6003 len. 5]: Was it ALL self-denial ?
Parsing [sent. 6004 len. 6]: Was there no self-indulgence ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6005 len. 24]: She made a broken gesture of lifting her hands to her head , let them drop by her side , and said nothing .
Parsing [sent. 6006 len. 8]: `` You knew you were doing wrong .
Parsing [sent. 6007 len. 9]: You felt it even more than he did .
Parsing [sent. 6008 len. 46]: For God made you with a more delicate sense of purity , with a shrinking from the temptation , with a womanly foreboding of disgrace , to help you to hold the cup of your honour steady , which yet you dropped on the ground .
Parsing [sent. 6009 len. 13]: Do not seek refuge in the cant about a woman 's weakness .
Parsing [sent. 6010 len. 34]: The strength of the woman is as needful to her womanhood as the strength of the man is to his manhood ; and a woman is just as strong as she will be .
Parsing [sent. 6011 len. 39]: And now , instead of humbling yourself before your Father in heaven , whom you have wronged more even than your father on earth , you rage over your injuries and cherish hatred against him who wronged you .
Parsing [sent. 6012 len. 22]: But I will go yet further , and show you , in God 's name , that you wronged your seducer .
Parsing [sent. 6013 len. 11]: For you were his keeper , as he was yours .
Parsing [sent. 6014 len. 29]: What if he had found a noble-hearted girl who also trusted him entirely -- just until she knew she ought not to listen to him a moment longer ?
Parsing [sent. 6015 len. 31]: who , when his love showed itself less than human , caring but for itself , rose in the royalty of her maidenhood , and looked him in the face ?
Parsing [sent. 6016 len. 25]: Would he not have been ashamed before her , and so before himself , seeing in the glass of her dignity his own contemptibleness ?
Parsing [sent. 6017 len. 18]: But instead of such a woman he found you , who let him do as he would .
Parsing [sent. 6018 len. 7]: No redemption for him in you .
Parsing [sent. 6019 len. 47]: And now he walks the earth the worse for you , defiled by your spoil , glorying in his poor victory over you , despising all women for your sake , unrepentant and proud , ruining others the easier that he has already ruined you . ''
Parsing [sent. 6020 len. 4]: `` He does !
Parsing [sent. 6021 len. 4]: he does ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6022 len. 11]: she shrieked ; `` but I will have my revenge .
Parsing [sent. 6023 len. 7]: I can and I will . ''
Parsing [sent. 6024 len. 13]: And , darting past me , she rushed out into the storm .
Parsing [sent. 6025 len. 16]: I followed , and could just see that she took the way to the village .
Parsing [sent. 6026 len. 13]: Her dim shape went down the wind before me into the darkness .
Parsing [sent. 6027 len. 34]: I followed in the same direction , fast and faster , for the wind was behind me , and a vague fear which ever grew in my heart urged me to overtake her .
Parsing [sent. 6028 len. 5]: What had I done ?
Parsing [sent. 6029 len. 9]: To what might I not have driven her ?
Parsing [sent. 6030 len. 59]: And although all I had said was true , and I had spoken from motives which , as far as I knew my own heart , I could not condemn , yet , as I sped after her , there came a reaction of feeling from the severity with which I had displayed her own case against her .
Parsing [sent. 6031 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 6032 len. 23]: poor sister , '' I thought , `` was it for me thus to reproach thee who had suffered already so fiercely ?
Parsing [sent. 6033 len. 42]: If the Spirit speaking in thy heart could not win thee , how should my words of hard accusation , true though they were , every one of them , rouse in thee anything but the wrath that springs from shame ?
Parsing [sent. 6034 len. 49]: Should I not have tried again , and yet again , to waken thy love ; and then a sweet and healing shame , like that of her who bathed the Master 's feet with her tears , would have bred fresh love , and no wrath . ''
Parsing [sent. 6035 len. 41]: But again I answered for myself , that my heart had not been the less tender towards her that I had tried to humble her , for it was that she might slip from under the net of her pride .
Parsing [sent. 6036 len. 19]: Even when my tongue spoke the hardest things I could find , my heart was yearning over her .
Parsing [sent. 6037 len. 28]: If I could but make her feel that she too had been wrong , would not the sense of common wrong between them help her to forgive ?
Parsing [sent. 6038 len. 38]: And with the first motion of willing pardon , would not a spring of tenderness , grief , and hope , burst from her poor old dried-up heart , and make it young and fresh once more !
Parsing [sent. 6039 len. 14]: Thus I reasoned with myself as I followed her back through the darkness .
Parsing [sent. 6040 len. 22]: The wind fell a little as we came near the village , and the rain began to come down in torrents .
Parsing [sent. 6041 len. 36]: There must have been a moon somewhere behind the clouds , for the darkness became less dense , and I began to fancy I could again see the dim shape which had rushed from me .
Parsing [sent. 6042 len. 11]: I increased my speed , and became certain of it .
Parsing [sent. 6043 len. 26]: Suddenly , her strength giving way , or her foot stumbling over something in the road , she fell to the earth with a cry .
Parsing [sent. 6044 len. 8]: I was beside her in a moment .
Parsing [sent. 6045 len. 4]: She was insensible .
Parsing [sent. 6046 len. 20]: I did what I could for her , and in a few minutes she began to come to herself .
Parsing [sent. 6047 len. 5]: `` Where am I ?
Parsing [sent. 6048 len. 5]: Who is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6049 len. 5]: she asked , listlessly .
Parsing [sent. 6050 len. 18]: When she found who I was , she made a great effort to rise , and succeeded .
Parsing [sent. 6051 len. 22]: `` You must take my arm , '' I said , `` and I will help you to the vicarage . ''
Parsing [sent. 6052 len. 10]: `` I will go home , '' she answered .
Parsing [sent. 6053 len. 16]: `` Lean on me now , at least ; for you must get somewhere . ''
Parsing [sent. 6054 len. 7]: `` What does it matter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6055 len. 18]: she said , in such a tone of despair , that it went to my very heart .
Parsing [sent. 6056 len. 19]: A wild half-cry , half-sob followed , and then she took my arm , and said nothing more .
Parsing [sent. 6057 len. 30]: Nor did I trouble her with any words , except , when we readied the gate , to beg her to come into the vicarage instead of going home .
Parsing [sent. 6058 len. 15]: But she would not listen to me , and so I took her home .
Parsing [sent. 6059 len. 11]: She pulled the key of the shop from her pocket .
Parsing [sent. 6060 len. 16]: Her hand trembled so that I took it from her , and opened the door .
Parsing [sent. 6061 len. 36]: A candle with a long snuff was flickering on the counter ; and stretched out on the counter , with his head about a foot from the candle , lay little Gerard , fast asleep .
Parsing [sent. 6062 len. 7]: `` Ah , little darling ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6063 len. 17]: I said in my heart , `` this is not much like painting the sky yet .
Parsing [sent. 6064 len. 5]: But who knows ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6065 len. 43]: And as I uttered the commonplace question in my mind , in my mind it was suddenly changed into the half of a great dim prophecy by the answer which arose to it there , for the answer was `` God . ''
Parsing [sent. 6066 len. 9]: I lifted the little fellow in my arms .
Parsing [sent. 6067 len. 21]: He had fallen asleep weeping , and his face was dirty , and streaked with the channels of his tears .
Parsing [sent. 6068 len. 21]: Catherine had snuffed the candle , and now stood with it in her hand , waiting for me to go .
Parsing [sent. 6069 len. 19]: But , without heeding her , I bore my child to the door that led to their dwelling .
Parsing [sent. 6070 len. 17]: I had never been up those stairs before , and therefore knew nothing of the way .
Parsing [sent. 6071 len. 14]: But without offering any opposition , his mother followed , and lighted me .
Parsing [sent. 6072 len. 17]: What a sad face of suffering and strife it was upon which that dim light fell !
Parsing [sent. 6073 len. 62]: She set the candle down upon the table of a small room at the top of the stairs , which might have been comfortable enough but that it was neglected and disordered ; and now I saw that she did not even have her child to sleep with her , for his crib stood in a corner of this their sitting-room .
Parsing [sent. 6074 len. 26]: I sat down on a haircloth couch , and proceeded to undress little Gerard , trying as much as I could not to wake him .
Parsing [sent. 6075 len. 7]: In this I was almost successful .
Parsing [sent. 6076 len. 10]: Catherine stood staring at me without saying a word .
Parsing [sent. 6077 len. 12]: She looked dazed , perhaps from the effects of her fall .
Parsing [sent. 6078 len. 8]: But she brought me his nightgown notwithstanding .
Parsing [sent. 6079 len. 53]: Just as I had finished putting it on , and was rising to lay him in his crib , he opened his eyes , and looked at me ; then gave a hurried look round , as if for his mother ; then threw his arms about my neck and kissed me .
Parsing [sent. 6080 len. 13]: I laid him down and the same moment he was fast asleep .
Parsing [sent. 6081 len. 13]: In the morning it would not be even a dream to him .
Parsing [sent. 6082 len. 19]: `` Now , '' I thought , `` you are safe for the night , poor fatherless child .
Parsing [sent. 6083 len. 12]: Even your mother 's hardness will not make you sad now .
Parsing [sent. 6084 len. 11]: Perhaps the heavenly Father will send you loving dreams . ''
Parsing [sent. 6085 len. 10]: I turned to Catherine , and bade her good-night .
Parsing [sent. 6086 len. 40]: She just put her hand in mine ; but , instead of returning my leave-taking , said : `` Do not fancy you will get the better of me , Mr Walton , by being kind to that boy .
Parsing [sent. 6087 len. 11]: I will have my revenge , and I know how .
Parsing [sent. 6088 len. 7]: I am only waiting my time .
Parsing [sent. 6089 len. 16]: When he is just going to drink , I will dash it from his hand .
Parsing [sent. 6090 len. 3]: I will .
Parsing [sent. 6091 len. 7]: At the altar I will . ''
Parsing [sent. 6092 len. 17]: Her eyes were flashing almost with madness , and she made fierce gestures with her arm .
Parsing [sent. 6093 len. 7]: I saw that argument was useless .
Parsing [sent. 6094 len. 12]: `` You loved him once , Catherine , '' I said .
Parsing [sent. 6095 len. 5]: `` Love him again .
Parsing [sent. 6096 len. 4]: Love him better .
Parsing [sent. 6097 len. 3]: Forgive him .
Parsing [sent. 6098 len. 12]: Revenge is far worse than anything you have done yet . ''
Parsing [sent. 6099 len. 6]: `` What do I care ?
Parsing [sent. 6100 len. 6]: Why should I care ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6101 len. 5]: And she laughed terribly .
Parsing [sent. 6102 len. 45]: I made haste to leave the room and the house ; but I lingered for nearly an hour about the place before I could make up my mind to go home , so much was I afraid lest she should do something altogether insane .
Parsing [sent. 6103 len. 41]: But at length I saw the candle appear in the shop , which was some relief to my anxiety ; and reflecting that her one consuming thought of revenge was some security for her conduct otherwise , I went home .
Parsing [sent. 6104 len. 20]: That night my own troubles seemed small to me , and I did not brood over them at all .
Parsing [sent. 6105 len. 71]: My mind was filled with the idea of the sad misery which , rather than in which , that poor woman was ; and I prayed for her as for a desolate human world whose sun had deserted the heavens , whose fair fields , rivers , and groves were hardening into the frost of death , and all their germs of hope becoming but portions of the lifeless mass .
Parsing [sent. 6106 len. 17]: `` If I am sorrowful , '' I said , `` God lives none the less .
Parsing [sent. 6107 len. 17]: And His will is better than mine , yea , is my hidden and perfected will .
Parsing [sent. 6108 len. 6]: In Him is my life .
Parsing [sent. 6109 len. 5]: His will be done .
Parsing [sent. 6110 len. 11]: What , then , is my trouble compared to hers ?
Parsing [sent. 6111 len. 11]: I will not sink into it and be selfish . ''
Parsing [sent. 6112 len. 12]: In the morning my first business was to inquire after her .
Parsing [sent. 6113 len. 15]: I found her in the shop , looking very ill , and obstinately reserved .
Parsing [sent. 6114 len. 20]: Gerard sat in a corner , looking as far from happy as a child of his years could look .
Parsing [sent. 6115 len. 11]: As I left the shop he crept out with me .
Parsing [sent. 6116 len. 11]: `` Gerard , come back , '' cried his mother .
Parsing [sent. 6117 len. 12]: `` I will not take him away , '' I said .
Parsing [sent. 6118 len. 23]: The boy looked up in my face , as if he wanted to whisper to me , and I stooped to listen .
Parsing [sent. 6119 len. 47]: `` I dreamed last night , '' said the boy , `` that a big angel with white wings came and took me out of my bed , and carried me high , high up -- so high that I could not dream any more . ''
Parsing [sent. 6120 len. 26]: `` We shall be carried up so high one day , Gerard , my boy , that we shall not want to dream any more .
Parsing [sent. 6121 len. 10]: For we shall be carried up to God himself .
Parsing [sent. 6122 len. 8]: Now go back to your mother . ''
Parsing [sent. 6123 len. 13]: He obeyed at once , and I went on through the village .
Parsing [sent. 6124 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXIII .
Parsing [sent. 6125 len. 6]: THE DEVIL IN THE VICAR .
Parsing [sent. 6126 len. 17]: I wanted just to pass the gate , and look up the road towards Oldcastle Hall .
Parsing [sent. 6127 len. 40]: I thought to see nothing but the empty road between the leafless trees , lying there like a dead stream that would not bear me on to the `` sunny pleasure-dome with caves of ice '' that lay beyond .
Parsing [sent. 6128 len. 29]: But just as I reached the gate , Miss Oldcastle came out of the lodge , where I learned afterwards the woman that kept the gate was ill .
Parsing [sent. 6129 len. 16]: When she saw me she stopped , and I entered hurriedly , and addressed her .
Parsing [sent. 6130 len. 11]: But I could say nothing better than the merest commonplaces .
Parsing [sent. 6131 len. 35]: For her old manner , which I had almost forgotten , a certain coldness shadowed with haughtiness , whose influence I had strongly felt when I began to make her acquaintance , had returned .
Parsing [sent. 6132 len. 38]: I can not make my reader understand how this could be blended with the sweetness in her face and the gentleness of her manners ; but there the opposites were , and I could feel them both .
Parsing [sent. 6133 len. 78]: There was likewise a certain drawing of herself away from me , which checked the smallest advance on my part ; so that -- I wonder at it now , but so it was -- after a few words of very ordinary conversation , I bade her good morning and went away , feeling like `` a man forbid '' -- as if I had done her some wrong , and she had chidden me for it .
Parsing [sent. 6134 len. 8]: What a stone lay in my breast !
Parsing [sent. 6135 len. 7]: I could hardly breathe for it .
Parsing [sent. 6136 len. 12]: What could have caused her to change her manner towards me ?
Parsing [sent. 6137 len. 13]: I had made no advance ; I could not have offended her .
Parsing [sent. 6138 len. 17]: Yet there she glided up the road , and here stood I , outside the gate .
Parsing [sent. 6139 len. 28]: That road was now a flowing river that bore from me the treasure of the earth , while my boat was spell-bound , and could not follow .
Parsing [sent. 6140 len. 21]: I would run after her , fall at her feet , and intreat to know wherein I had offended her .
Parsing [sent. 6141 len. 49]: But there I stood enchanted , and there she floated away between the trees ; till at length she turned the slow sweep , and I , breathing deep as she vanished from my sight , turned likewise , and walked back the dreary way to the village .
Parsing [sent. 6142 len. 15]: And now I knew that I had never been miserable in my life before .
Parsing [sent. 6143 len. 18]: And I knew , too , that I had never loved her as I loved her now .
Parsing [sent. 6144 len. 65]: But , as I had for the last ten years of my life been striving to be a right will , with a thousand failures and forgetfulnesses every one of those years , while yet the desire grew stronger as hope recovered from every failure , I would now try to do my work as if nothing had happened to incapacitate me for it .
Parsing [sent. 6145 len. 45]: So I went on to fulfil the plan with which I had left home , including , as it did , a visit to Thomas Weir , whom I had not seen in his own shop since he had ordered me out of it .
Parsing [sent. 6146 len. 15]: This , as far as I was concerned , was more accidental than intentional .
Parsing [sent. 6147 len. 93]: I had , indeed , abstained from going to him for a while , in order to give him time TO COME ROUND ; but then circumstances which I have recorded intervened to prevent me ; so that as yet no advance had been made on my part any more than on his towards a reconciliation ; which , however , could have been such only on one side , for I had not been in the least offended by the way he had behaved to me , and needed no reconciliation .
Parsing [sent. 6148 len. 24]: To tell the truth , I was pleased to find that my words had had force enough with him to rouse his wrath .
Parsing [sent. 6149 len. 5]: Anything rather than indifference !
Parsing [sent. 6150 len. 37]: That the heart of the honest man would in the end right me , I could not doubt ; in the meantime I would see whether a friendly call might not improve the state of affairs .
Parsing [sent. 6151 len. 26]: Till he yielded to the voice within him , however , I could not expect that our relation to each other would be quite restored .
Parsing [sent. 6152 len. 39]: As long as he resisted his conscience , and knew that I sided with his conscience , it was impossible he should regard me with peaceful eyes , however much he might desire to be friendly with me .
Parsing [sent. 6153 len. 22]: I found him busy , as usual , for he was one of the most diligent men I have ever known .
Parsing [sent. 6154 len. 26]: But his face was gloomy , and I thought or fancied that the old scorn had begun once more to usurp the expression of it .
Parsing [sent. 6155 len. 8]: Young Tom was not in the shop .
Parsing [sent. 6156 len. 16]: `` It is a long time since I saw you , now , Thomas . ''
Parsing [sent. 6157 len. 38]: `` I can hardly wonder at that , '' he returned , as if he were trying to do me justice ; but his eyes dropped , and he resumed his work , and said no more .
Parsing [sent. 6158 len. 28]: I thought it better to make no reference to the past even by assuring him that it was not from resentment that I had been a stranger .
Parsing [sent. 6159 len. 6]: `` How is Tom ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6160 len. 3]: I asked .
Parsing [sent. 6161 len. 8]: `` Well enough , '' he returned .
Parsing [sent. 6162 len. 24]: Then , with a smile of peevishness not unmingled with contempt , he added : `` He 's getting too uppish for me .
Parsing [sent. 6163 len. 11]: I do n't think the Latin agrees with him . ''
Parsing [sent. 6164 len. 61]: I could not help suspecting at once how the matter stood -- namely , that the father , unhappy in his conduct to his daughter , and unable to make up his mind to do right with regard to her , had been behaving captiously and unjustly to his son , and so had rendered himself more miserable than ever .
Parsing [sent. 6165 len. 54]: `` Perhaps he finds it too much for him without me , '' I said , evasively ; `` but I called to-day partly to inform him that I am quite ready now to recommence our readings together ; after which I hope you will find the Latin agree with him better . ''
Parsing [sent. 6166 len. 21]: `` I wish you would let him alone , sir -- I mean , take no more trouble about him .
Parsing [sent. 6167 len. 45]: You see I ca n't do as you want me ; I was n't made to go another man 's way ; and so it 's very hard -- more than I can bear -- to be under so much obligation to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 6168 len. 9]: `` But you mistake me altogether , Thomas .
Parsing [sent. 6169 len. 18]: It is for the lad 's own sake that I want to go on reading with him .
Parsing [sent. 6170 len. 17]: And you wo n't interfere between him and any use I can be of to him .
Parsing [sent. 6171 len. 43]: I assure you , to have you go my way instead of your own is the last thing I could wish , though I confess I do wish very much that you would choose the right way for your own way . ''
Parsing [sent. 6172 len. 12]: He made me no answer , but maintained a sullen silence .
Parsing [sent. 6173 len. 50]: `` Thomas , '' I said at length , `` I had thought you were breaking every bond of Satan that withheld you from entering into the kingdom of heaven ; but I fear he has strengthened his bands and holds you now as much a captive as ever .
Parsing [sent. 6174 len. 17]: So it is not even your own way you are walking in , but his . ''
Parsing [sent. 6175 len. 11]: `` It 's no use your trying to frighten me .
Parsing [sent. 6176 len. 9]: I do n't believe in the devil . ''
Parsing [sent. 6177 len. 11]: `` It is God I want you to believe in .
Parsing [sent. 6178 len. 19]: And I am not going to dispute with you now about whether there is a devil or not .
Parsing [sent. 6179 len. 18]: In a matter of life and death we have no time for settling every disputed point . ''
Parsing [sent. 6180 len. 5]: `` Life or death !
Parsing [sent. 6181 len. 6]: What do you mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6182 len. 28]: `` I mean that whether you believe there is a devil or not , you KNOW there is an evil power in your mind dragging you down .
Parsing [sent. 6183 len. 21]: I am not speaking in generals ; I mean NOW , and you know as to what I mean it .
Parsing [sent. 6184 len. 26]: And if you yield to it , that evil power , whatever may be your theory about it , will drag you down to death .
Parsing [sent. 6185 len. 20]: It is a matter of life or death , I repeat , not of theory about the devil . ''
Parsing [sent. 6186 len. 34]: `` Well , I always did say , that if you once give a priest an inch he 'll take an ell ; and I am sorry I forgot it for once . ''
Parsing [sent. 6187 len. 26]: Having said this , he shut up his mouth in a manner that indicated plainly enough he would not open it again for some time .
Parsing [sent. 6188 len. 26]: This , more than his speech , irritated me , and with a mere `` good morning , '' I walked out of the shop .
Parsing [sent. 6189 len. 101]: No sooner was I in the open air than I knew that I too , I as well as poor Thomas Weir , was under a spell ; knew that I had gone to him before I had recovered sufficiently from the mingled disappointment and mortification of my interview with Miss Oldcastle ; that while I spoke to him I was not speaking with a whole heart ; that I had been discharging a duty as if I had been discharging a musket ; that , although I had spoken the truth , I had spoken it ungraciously and selfishly .
Parsing [sent. 6190 len. 6]: I could not bear it .
Parsing [sent. 6191 len. 10]: I turned instantly and went back into the shop .
Parsing [sent. 6192 len. 21]: `` Thomas , my friend , '' I said , holding out my hand , `` I beg your pardon .
Parsing [sent. 6193 len. 4]: I was wrong .
Parsing [sent. 6194 len. 9]: I spoke to you as I ought not .
Parsing [sent. 6195 len. 30]: I was troubled in my own mind , and that made me lose my temper and be rude to you , who are far more troubled than I am .
Parsing [sent. 6196 len. 4]: Forgive me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6197 len. 39]: He did not take my hand at first , but stared at me as if , not comprehending me , he supposed that I was backing up what I had said last with more of the same sort .
Parsing [sent. 6198 len. 58]: But by the time I had finished he saw what I meant ; his countenance altered and looked as if the evil spirit were about to depart from him ; he held out his hand , gave mine a great grasp , dropped his head , went on with his work , and said never a word .
Parsing [sent. 6199 len. 16]: I went out of the shop once more , but in a greatly altered mood .
Parsing [sent. 6200 len. 22]: On the way home , I tried to find out how it was that I had that morning failed so signally .
Parsing [sent. 6201 len. 26]: I had little virtue in keeping my temper , because it was naturally very even ; therefore I had the more shame in losing it .
Parsing [sent. 6202 len. 26]: I had borne all my uneasiness about Miss Oldcastle without , as far as I knew , transgressing in this fashion till this very morning .
Parsing [sent. 6203 len. 12]: Were great sorrows less hurtful to the temper than small disappointments ?
Parsing [sent. 6204 len. 4]: Yes , surely .
Parsing [sent. 6205 len. 43]: But Shakespeare represents Brutus , after hearing of the sudden death of his wife , as losing his temper with Cassius to a degree that bewildered the latter , who said he did not know that Brutus could have been so angry .
Parsing [sent. 6206 len. 18]: Is this consistent with the character of the stately-minded Brutus , or with the dignity of sorrow ?
Parsing [sent. 6207 len. 3]: It is .
Parsing [sent. 6208 len. 59]: For the loss of his wife alone would have made him only less irritable ; but the whole weight of an army , with its distracting cares and conflicting interests , pressed upon him ; and the battle of an empire was to be fought at daybreak , so that he could not be alone with his grief .
Parsing [sent. 6209 len. 22]: Between the silence of death in his mind , and the roar of life in his brain , he became irritable .
Parsing [sent. 6210 len. 24]: Looking yet deeper into it , I found that till this morning I had experienced no personal mortification with respect to Miss Oldcastle .
Parsing [sent. 6211 len. 49]: It was not the mere disappointment of having no more talk with her , for the sight of her was a blessing I had not in the least expected , that had worked upon me , but the fact that she had repelled or seemed to repel me .
Parsing [sent. 6212 len. 48]: And thus I found that self was at the root of the wrong I had done to one over whose mental condition , especially while I was telling him the unwelcome truth , I ought to have been as tender as a mother over her wounded child .
Parsing [sent. 6213 len. 53]: I could not say that it was wrong to feel disappointed or even mortified ; but something was wrong when one whose especial business it was to serve his people in the name of Him who was full of grace and truth , made them suffer because of his own inward pain .
Parsing [sent. 6214 len. 18]: No sooner had I settled this in my mind than my trouble returned with a sudden pang .
Parsing [sent. 6215 len. 23]: Had I actually seen her that morning , and spoken to her , and left her with a pain in my heart ?
Parsing [sent. 6216 len. 31]: What if that face of hers was doomed ever to bring with it such a pain -- to be ever to me no more than a lovely vision radiating grief ?
Parsing [sent. 6217 len. 38]: If so , I would endure in silence and as patiently as I could , trying to make up for the lack of brightness in my own fate by causing more brightness in the fate of others .
Parsing [sent. 6218 len. 12]: I would at least keep on trying to do my work .
Parsing [sent. 6219 len. 12]: That moment I felt a little hand poke itself into mine .
Parsing [sent. 6220 len. 15]: I looked down , and there was Gerard Weir looking up in my face .
Parsing [sent. 6221 len. 23]: I found myself in the midst of the children coming out of school , for it was Saturday , and a half-holiday .
Parsing [sent. 6222 len. 37]: He smiled in my face , and I hope I smiled in his ; and so , hand in hand , we went on to the vicarage , where I gave him up to my sister .
Parsing [sent. 6223 len. 25]: But I can not convey to my reader any notion of the quietness that entered my heart with the grasp of that childish hand .
Parsing [sent. 6224 len. 40]: I think it was the faith of the boy in me that comforted me , but I could not help thinking of the words of our Lord about receiving a child in His name , and so receiving Him .
Parsing [sent. 6225 len. 13]: By the time we reached the vicarage my heart was very quiet .
Parsing [sent. 6226 len. 20]: As the little child held by my hand , so I seemed to be holding by God 's hand .
Parsing [sent. 6227 len. 40]: And a sense of heart-security , as well as soul-safety , awoke in me ; and I said to myself , -- Surely He will take care of my heart as well as of my mind and my conscience .
Parsing [sent. 6228 len. 49]: For one blessed moment I seemed to be at the very centre of things , looking out quietly upon my own troubled emotions as upon something outside of me -- apart from me , even as one from the firm rock may look abroad upon the vexed sea .
Parsing [sent. 6229 len. 27]: And I thought I then knew something of what the apostle meant when he said , `` Your life is hid with Christ in God . ''
Parsing [sent. 6230 len. 15]: I knew that there was a deeper self than that which was thus troubled .
Parsing [sent. 6231 len. 19]: I had not had my usual ramble this morning , and was otherwise ill prepared for the Sunday .
Parsing [sent. 6232 len. 34]: So I went early into the church ; but finding that the sexton 's wife had not yet finished lighting the stove , I sat down by my own fire in the vestry .
Parsing [sent. 6233 len. 17]: Suppose I am sitting there now while I say one word for our congregations in winter .
Parsing [sent. 6234 len. 13]: I was very particular in having the church well warmed before Sunday .
Parsing [sent. 6235 len. 49]: I think some parsons must neglect seeing after this matter on principle , because warmth may make a weary creature go to sleep here and there about the place : as if any healing doctrine could enter the soul while it is on the rack of the frost .
Parsing [sent. 6236 len. 30]: The clergy should see -- for it is their business -- that their people have no occasion to think of their bodies at all while they are in church .
Parsing [sent. 6237 len. 10]: They have enough ado to think of the truth .
Parsing [sent. 6238 len. 19]: When our Lord was feeding even their bodies , He made them all sit down on the grass .
Parsing [sent. 6239 len. 44]: It is worth noticing that there was much grass in the place -- a rare thing I should think in those countries -- and therefore , perhaps , it was chosen by Him for their comfort in feeding their souls and bodies both .
Parsing [sent. 6240 len. 61]: If I may judge from experiences of my own , one of the reasons why some churches are of all places the least likely for anything good to be found in , is , that they are as wretchedly cold to the body as they are to the soul -- too cold every way for anything to grow in them .
Parsing [sent. 6241 len. 30]: Edelweiss , `` Noble-white '' -- as they call a plant growing under the snow on some of the Alps -- could not survive the winter in such churches .
Parsing [sent. 6242 len. 9]: There is small welcome in a cold house .
Parsing [sent. 6243 len. 14]: And the clergyman , who is the steward , should look to it .
Parsing [sent. 6244 len. 32]: It is for him to give his Master 's friends a welcome to his Master 's house -- for the welcome of a servant is precious , and now-a-days very rare .
Parsing [sent. 6245 len. 8]: And now Mrs Stone must have finished .
Parsing [sent. 6246 len. 18]: I go into the old church which looks as if it were quietly waiting for its people .
Parsing [sent. 6247 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 6248 len. 6]: She has not done yet .
Parsing [sent. 6249 len. 3]: Never mind .
Parsing [sent. 6250 len. 10]: -- How full of meaning the vaulted roof looks !
Parsing [sent. 6251 len. 39]: as if , having gathered a soul of its own out of the generations that have worshipped here for so long , it had feeling enough to grow hungry for a psalm before the end of the week .
Parsing [sent. 6252 len. 35]: Some such half-foolish fancy was now passing through my tranquillized mind or rather heart -- for the mind would have rejected it at once -- when to my -- what shall I call it ?
Parsing [sent. 6253 len. 24]: -- not amazement , for the delight was too strong for amazement -- the old organ woke up and began to think aloud .
Parsing [sent. 6254 len. 50]: As if it had been brooding over it all the week in the wonderful convolutions of its wooden brain , it began to sigh out the Agnus Dei of Mozart 's twelfth mass upon the air of the still church , which lay swept and garnished for the Sunday .
Parsing [sent. 6255 len. 6]: -- How could it be ?
Parsing [sent. 6256 len. 25]: I know now ; and I guessed then ; and my guess was right ; and my reader must be content to guess too .
Parsing [sent. 6257 len. 38]: I took no step to verify my conjecture , for I felt that I was upon my honour , but sat in one of the pews and listened , till the old organ sobbed itself into silence .
Parsing [sent. 6258 len. 66]: Then I heard the steps of the sexton 's wife vanish from the church , heard her lock the door , and knew that I was alone in the ancient pile , with the twilight growing thick about me , and felt like Sir Galahad , when , after the `` rolling organ-harmony , '' he heard `` wings flutter , voices hover clear . ''
Parsing [sent. 6259 len. 45]: In a moment the mood changed ; and I was sorry , not that the dear organ was dead for the night , but actually felt gently-mournful that the wonderful old thing never had and never could have a conscious life of its own .
Parsing [sent. 6260 len. 96]: So strangely does the passion -- which I had not invented , reader , whoever thou art that thinkest love and a church do not well harmonize -- so strangely , I say , full to overflowing of its own vitality , does it radiate life , that it would even of its own superabundance quicken into blessed consciousness the inanimate objects around it , thinking what they would feel had they a consciousness correspondent to their form , were their faculties moved from within themselves instead of from the will and operation of humanity .
Parsing [sent. 6261 len. 19]: I lingered on long in the dark church , as my reader knows I had done often before .
Parsing [sent. 6262 len. 18]: Nor did I move from the seat I had first taken till I left the sacred building .
Parsing [sent. 6263 len. 11]: And there I made my sermon for the next morning .
Parsing [sent. 6264 len. 9]: And herewith I impart it to my reader .
Parsing [sent. 6265 len. 67]: But he need not be afraid of another such as I have already given him , for I impart it only in its original germ , its concentrated essence of sermon -- these four verses : Had I the grace to win the grace Of some old man complete in lore , My face would worship at his face , Like childhood seated on the floor .
Parsing [sent. 6266 len. 32]: Had I the grace to win the grace Of childhood , loving shy , apart , The child should find a nearer place , And teach me resting on my heart .
Parsing [sent. 6267 len. 31]: Had I the grace to win the grace Of maiden living all above , My soul would trample down the base , That she might have a man to love .
Parsing [sent. 6268 len. 33]: A grace I have no grace to win Knocks now at my half-open door : Ah , Lord of glory , come thou in , Thy grace divine is all and more .
Parsing [sent. 6269 len. 8]: This was what I made for myself .
Parsing [sent. 6270 len. 18]: I told my people that God had created all our worships , reverences , tendernesses , loves .
Parsing [sent. 6271 len. 23]: That they had come out of His heart , and He had made them in us because they were in Him first .
Parsing [sent. 6272 len. 11]: That otherwise He would not have cared to make them .
Parsing [sent. 6273 len. 54]: That all that we could imagine of the wise , the lovely , the beautiful , was in Him , only infinitely more of them than we could not merely imagine , but understand , even if He did all He could to explain them to us , to make us understand them .
Parsing [sent. 6274 len. 88]: That in Him was all the wise teaching of the best man ever known in the world and more ; all the grace and gentleness and truth of the best child and more ; all the tenderness and devotion of the truest type of womankind and more ; for there is a love that passeth the love of woman , not the love of Jonathan to David , though David said so : but the love of God to the men and women whom He has made .
Parsing [sent. 6275 len. 34]: Therefore , we must be all God 's ; and all our aspirations , all our worships , all our honours , all our loves , must centre in Him , the Best .
Parsing [sent. 6276 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXIV .
Parsing [sent. 6277 len. 4]: AN ANGEL UNAWARES .
Parsing [sent. 6278 len. 39]: Feeling rather more than the usual reaction so well-known to clergymen after the concentrated duties of the Sunday , I resolved on Monday to have the long country walk I had been disappointed of on the Saturday previous .
Parsing [sent. 6279 len. 15]: It was such a day as it seems impossible to describe except in negatives .
Parsing [sent. 6280 len. 65]: It was not stormy , it was not rainy , it was not sunshiny , it was not snowy , it was not frosty , it was not foggy , it was not clear , it was nothing but cloudy and quiet and cold and generally ungenial , with just a puff of wind now and then to give an assertion to its ungeniality .
Parsing [sent. 6281 len. 28]: I should not in the least have cared to tell what sort the day was , had it not been an exact representation of my own mind .
Parsing [sent. 6282 len. 12]: It was not the day that made me such as itself .
Parsing [sent. 6283 len. 24]: The weather could always easily influence the surface of my mind , my external mood , but it could never go much further .
Parsing [sent. 6284 len. 16]: The smallest pleasure would break through the conditions that merely came of such a day .
Parsing [sent. 6285 len. 13]: But this morning my whole mind and heart seemed like the day .
Parsing [sent. 6286 len. 15]: The summer was thousands of miles off on the other side of the globe .
Parsing [sent. 6287 len. 18]: Ethelwyn , up at the old house there across the river , seemed millions of miles away .
Parsing [sent. 6288 len. 19]: The summer MIGHT come back ; she never would come nearer : it was absurd to expect it .
Parsing [sent. 6289 len. 16]: For in such moods stupidity constantly arrogates to itself the qualities and claims of insight .
Parsing [sent. 6290 len. 21]: In fact , it passes itself off for common sense , making the most dreary ever appear the most reasonable .
Parsing [sent. 6291 len. 65]: In such moods a man might almost be persuaded that it was ridiculous to expect any such poetic absurdity as the summer , with its diamond mornings and its opal evenings , ever to come again ; nay , to think that it ever had had any existence except in the fancies of the human heart -- one of its castles in the air .
Parsing [sent. 6292 len. 46]: The whole of life seemed faint and foggy , with no red in it anywhere ; and when I glanced at my present relations in Marshmallows , I could not help finding several circumstances to give some appearance of justice to this appearance of things .
Parsing [sent. 6293 len. 10]: I seemed to myself to have done no good .
Parsing [sent. 6294 len. 29]: I had driven Catherine Weir to the verge of suicide , while at the same time I could not restrain her from the contemplation of some dire revenge .
Parsing [sent. 6295 len. 23]: I had lost the man upon whom I had most reckoned as a seal of my ministry , namely , Thomas Weir .
Parsing [sent. 6296 len. 18]: True there was Old Rogers ; but Old Rogers was just as good before I found him .
Parsing [sent. 6297 len. 11]: I could not dream of having made him any better .
Parsing [sent. 6298 len. 40]: And so I went on brooding over all the disappointing portions of my labour , all the time thinking about myself , instead of God and the work that lay for me to do in the days to come .
Parsing [sent. 6299 len. 14]: `` Nobody , '' I said , `` but Old Rogers understands me .
Parsing [sent. 6300 len. 22]: Nobody would care , as far as my teaching goes , if another man took my place from next Sunday forward .
Parsing [sent. 6301 len. 86]: And for Miss Oldcastle , her playing the Agnus Dei on Saturday afternoon , even if she intended that I should hear it , could only indicate at most that she knew how she had behaved to me in the morning , and thought she had gone too far and been unkind , or perhaps was afraid lest she should be accountable for any failure I might make in my Sunday duties , and therefore felt bound to do something to restore my equanimity . ''
Parsing [sent. 6302 len. 54]: Choosing , though without consciously intending to do so , the dreariest path to be found , I wandered up the side of the slow black river , with the sentinel pollards looking at themselves in its gloomy mirror , just as I was looking at myself in the mirror of my circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 6303 len. 15]: They leaned in all directions , irregular as the headstones in an ancient churchyard .
Parsing [sent. 6304 len. 27]: In the summer they looked like explosions of green leaves at the best ; now they looked like the burnt-out cases of the summer 's fireworks .
Parsing [sent. 6305 len. 51]: How different , too , was the river from the time when a whole fleet of shining white lilies lay anchored among their own broad green leaves upon its clear waters , filled with sunlight in every pore , as they themselves would fill the pores of a million-caverned sponge !
Parsing [sent. 6306 len. 12]: But I could not even recall the past summer as beautiful .
Parsing [sent. 6307 len. 7]: I seemed to care for nothing .
Parsing [sent. 6308 len. 28]: The first miserable afternoon at Marshmallows looked now as if it had been the whole of my coming relation to the place seen through a reversed telescope .
Parsing [sent. 6309 len. 8]: And here I was IN it now .
Parsing [sent. 6310 len. 15]: The walk along the side was tolerably dry , although the river was bank-full .
Parsing [sent. 6311 len. 58]: But when I came to the bridge I wanted to cross -- a wooden one -- I found that the approach to it had been partly undermined and carried away , for here the river had overflowed its banks in one of the late storms ; and all about the place was still very wet and swampy .
Parsing [sent. 6312 len. 19]: I could therefore get no farther in my gloomy walk , and so turned back upon my steps .
Parsing [sent. 6313 len. 26]: Scarcely had I done so , when I saw a man coming hastily towards me from far upon the straight line of the river walk .
Parsing [sent. 6314 len. 9]: I could not mistake him at any distance .
Parsing [sent. 6315 len. 5]: It was Old Rogers .
Parsing [sent. 6316 len. 11]: I felt both ashamed and comforted when I recognized him .
Parsing [sent. 6317 len. 42]: `` Well , Old Rogers , '' I said , as soon as he came within hail , trying to speak cheerfully , `` you can not get much farther this way -- without wading a bit , at least . ''
Parsing [sent. 6318 len. 13]: `` I do n't want to go no farther now , sir .
Parsing [sent. 6319 len. 7]: I came to find you . ''
Parsing [sent. 6320 len. 8]: `` Nothing amiss , I hope ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6321 len. 9]: `` Nothing as I knows on , sir .
Parsing [sent. 6322 len. 11]: I only wanted to have a little chat with you .
Parsing [sent. 6323 len. 13]: I told master I wanted to leave for an hour or so .
Parsing [sent. 6324 len. 11]: He allus lets me do just as I like . ''
Parsing [sent. 6325 len. 12]: `` But how did you know where to find me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6326 len. 8]: `` I saw you come this way .
Parsing [sent. 6327 len. 16]: You passed me right on the bridge , and did n't see me , sir .
Parsing [sent. 6328 len. 18]: So says I to myself , ` Old Rogers , summat 's amiss wi ' parson to-day .
Parsing [sent. 6329 len. 9]: He never went by me like that afore .
Parsing [sent. 6330 len. 5]: This wo n't do .
Parsing [sent. 6331 len. 7]: You just go and see . '
Parsing [sent. 6332 len. 15]: So I went home and told master , and here I be , sir .
Parsing [sent. 6333 len. 14]: And I hope you 're noways offended with the liberty of me . ''
Parsing [sent. 6334 len. 11]: `` Did I really pass you on the bridge ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6335 len. 8]: I said , unable to understand it .
Parsing [sent. 6336 len. 7]: `` That you did , sir .
Parsing [sent. 6337 len. 21]: I knowed parson must be a goodish bit in his own in ` ards afore he would do that . ''
Parsing [sent. 6338 len. 16]: `` I need n't tell you I did n't see you , Old Rogers . ''
Parsing [sent. 6339 len. 9]: `` I could tell you that , sir .
Parsing [sent. 6340 len. 11]: I hope there 's nothing gone main wrong , sir .
Parsing [sent. 6341 len. 10]: Miss is well , sir , I hope ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6342 len. 8]: `` Quite well , I thank you .
Parsing [sent. 6343 len. 16]: No , my dear fellow , nothing 's gone main wrong , as you say .
Parsing [sent. 6344 len. 14]: Some of my running tackle got jammed a bit , that 's all .
Parsing [sent. 6345 len. 12]: I 'm a little out of spirits , I believe . ''
Parsing [sent. 6346 len. 17]: `` Well , sir , do n't you be afeard I 'm going to be troublesome .
Parsing [sent. 6347 len. 18]: Do n't think I want to get aboard your ship , except you fling me a rope .
Parsing [sent. 6348 len. 30]: There 's a many things you mun ha ' to think about that an ignorant man like me could n't take up if you was to let 'em drop .
Parsing [sent. 6349 len. 16]: And being a gentleman , I do believe , makes the matter worse betuxt us .
Parsing [sent. 6350 len. 22]: And there 's many a thing that no man can go talkin ' about to any but only the Lord himself .
Parsing [sent. 6351 len. 37]: Still you ca n't help us poor folks seeing when there 's summat amiss , and we ca n't help havin ' our own thoughts any more than the sailor 's jackdaw that could n't speak .
Parsing [sent. 6352 len. 27]: And sometimes we may be nearer the mark than you would suppose , for God has made us all of one blood , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 6353 len. 11]: `` What ARE you driving at , Old Rogers ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6354 len. 27]: I said with a smile , which was none the less true that I suspected he had read some of the worst trouble of my heart .
Parsing [sent. 6355 len. 39]: For why should I mind an honourable man like him knowing what oppressed me , though , as things went , I certainly should not , as he said , choose to tell it to any but one ?
Parsing [sent. 6356 len. 70]: `` I do n't want to say what I was driving at , if it was anything but this -- that I want to put to the clumsy hand of a rough old tar , with a heart as soft as the pitch that makes his hand hard -- to trim your sails a bit , sir , and help you to lie a point closer to the wind .
Parsing [sent. 6357 len. 9]: You 're not just close-hauled , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 6358 len. 7]: `` Say on , Old Rogers .
Parsing [sent. 6359 len. 23]: I understand you , and I will listen with all my heart , for you have a good right to speak . ''
Parsing [sent. 6360 len. 22]: And Old Rogers spoke thus : -- `` Oncet upon a time , I made a voyage in a merchant barque .
Parsing [sent. 6361 len. 8]: We were becalmed in the South Seas .
Parsing [sent. 6362 len. 17]: And weary work it wur , a doin ' of nothin ' from day to day .
Parsing [sent. 6363 len. 22]: But when the water began to come up thick from the bottom of the water-casks , it was wearier a deal .
Parsing [sent. 6364 len. 33]: Then a thick fog came on , as white as snow a ` most , and we could n't see more than a few yards ahead or on any side of us .
Parsing [sent. 6365 len. 24]: But the fog did n't keep the heat off ; it only made it worse , and the water was fast going done .
Parsing [sent. 6366 len. 30]: The short allowance grew shorter and shorter , and the men , some of them , were half-mad with thirst , and began to look bad at one another .
Parsing [sent. 6367 len. 11]: I kept up my heart by looking ahead inside me .
Parsing [sent. 6368 len. 23]: For days and days the fog hung about us as if the air had been made o ' flocks o ' wool .
Parsing [sent. 6369 len. 28]: The captain took to his berth , and several of the crew to their hammocks , for it was just as hot on deck as anywhere else .
Parsing [sent. 6370 len. 12]: The mate lay on a sparesail on the quarter-deck , groaning .
Parsing [sent. 6371 len. 25]: I had a strong suspicion that the schooner was drifting , and hove the lead again and again , but could find no bottom .
Parsing [sent. 6372 len. 18]: Some of the men got hold of the spirits , and THAT did n't quench their thirst .
Parsing [sent. 6373 len. 6]: It drove them clean mad .
Parsing [sent. 6374 len. 24]: I had to knock one of them down myself with a capstan bar , for he ran at the mate with his knife .
Parsing [sent. 6375 len. 9]: At last I began to lose all hope .
Parsing [sent. 6376 len. 11]: And still I was sure the schooner was slowly drifting .
Parsing [sent. 6377 len. 20]: My head was like to burst , and my tongue was like a lump of holystone in my mouth .
Parsing [sent. 6378 len. 50]: Well , one morning , I had just , as I thought , lain down on the deck to breathe my last , hoping I should die before I went quite mad with thirst , when all at once the fog lifted , like the foot of a sail .
Parsing [sent. 6379 len. 6]: I sprung to my feet .
Parsing [sent. 6380 len. 15]: There was the blue sky overhead ; but the terrible burning sun was there .
Parsing [sent. 6381 len. 56]: A moment more and a light air blew on my cheek , and , turning my face to it as if it had been the very breath of God , there was an island within half a mile , and I saw the shine of water on the face of a rock on the shore .
Parsing [sent. 6382 len. 10]: I cried out , ` Land on the weather-quarter !
Parsing [sent. 6383 len. 5]: Water in sight ! '
Parsing [sent. 6384 len. 44]: In a moment more a boat was lowered , and in a few minutes the boat 's crew , of which I was one , were lying , clothes and all , in a little stream that came down from the hills above .
Parsing [sent. 6385 len. 6]: -- There , Mr Walton !
Parsing [sent. 6386 len. 11]: that 's what I wanted to say to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 6387 len. 23]: This is as near the story of my old friend as my limited knowledge of sea affairs allows me to report it .
Parsing [sent. 6388 len. 19]: `` I understand you quite , Old Rogers , and I thank you heartily , '' I said .
Parsing [sent. 6389 len. 81]: `` No doubt , '' resumed he , `` King Solomon was quite right , as he always was , I suppose , in what he SAID , for his wisdom mun ha ' laid mostly in the tongue -- right , I say , when he said , ` Boast not thyself of to-morrow ; for thou knowest not what a day may bring forth ; ' but I ca n't help thinking there 's another side to it .
Parsing [sent. 6390 len. 65]: I think it would be as good advice to a man on the other tack , whose boasting lay far to windward , and he close on a lee-shore wi ' breakers -- it would n't be amiss to say to him , ` Do n't strike your colours to the morrow ; for thou knowest not what a day may bring forth . '
Parsing [sent. 6391 len. 23]: There 's just as many good days as bad ones ; as much fair weather as foul in the days to come .
Parsing [sent. 6392 len. 27]: And if a man keeps up heart , he 's all the better for that , and none the worse when the evil day does come .
Parsing [sent. 6393 len. 6]: But , God forgive me !
Parsing [sent. 6394 len. 7]: I 'm talking like a heathen .
Parsing [sent. 6395 len. 14]: As if there was any chance about what the days would bring forth .
Parsing [sent. 6396 len. 35]: No , my lad , '' said the old sailor , assuming the dignity of his superior years under the inspiration of the truth , `` boast nor trust nor hope in the morrow .
Parsing [sent. 6397 len. 27]: Boast and trust and hope in God , for thou shalt yet praise Him , who is the health of thy countenance and thy God . ''
Parsing [sent. 6398 len. 8]: I could but hold out my hand .
Parsing [sent. 6399 len. 6]: I had nothing to say .
Parsing [sent. 6400 len. 12]: For he had spoken to me as an angel of God .
Parsing [sent. 6401 len. 18]: The old man was silent for some moments : his emotion needed time to still itself again .
Parsing [sent. 6402 len. 8]: Nor did he return to the subject .
Parsing [sent. 6403 len. 16]: He held out his hand once more , saying -- `` Good day , sir .
Parsing [sent. 6404 len. 9]: I must go back to my work . ''
Parsing [sent. 6405 len. 12]: `` I will go back with you , '' I returned .
Parsing [sent. 6406 len. 41]: And so we walked back side by side to the village , but not a word did we speak the one to the other , till we shook hands and parted upon the bridge , where we had first met .
Parsing [sent. 6407 len. 14]: Old Rogers went to his work , and I lingered upon the bridge .
Parsing [sent. 6408 len. 37]: I leaned upon the low parapet , and looked up the stream as far as the mists creeping about the banks , and hovering in thinnest veils over the surface of the water , would permit .
Parsing [sent. 6409 len. 32]: Then I turned and looked down the river crawling on to the sweep it made out of sight just where Mr Brownrigg 's farm began to come down to its banks .
Parsing [sent. 6410 len. 74]: Then I looked to the left , and there stood my old church , as quiet in the dreary day , though not so bright , as in the sunshine : even the graves themselves must look yet more `` solemn sad '' in a wintry day like this , than they look when the sunlight that infolds them proclaims that God is not the God of the dead but of the living .
Parsing [sent. 6411 len. 35]: One of the great battles that we have to fight in this world -- for twenty great battles have to be fought all at once and in one -- is the battle with appearances .
Parsing [sent. 6412 len. 33]: I turned me to the right , and there once more I saw , as on that first afternoon , the weathercock that watched the winds over the stables at Oldcastle Hall .
Parsing [sent. 6413 len. 35]: It had caught just one glimpse of the sun through some rent in the vapours , and flung it across to me , ere it vanished again amid the general dinginess of the hour .
Parsing [sent. 6414 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXV .
Parsing [sent. 6415 len. 3]: TWO PARISHIONERS .
Parsing [sent. 6416 len. 50]: I HAVE said , near the beginning of my story , that my parish was a large one : how is it that I have mentioned but one of the great families in it , and have indeed confined my recollections entirely to the village and its immediate neighbourhood ?
Parsing [sent. 6417 len. 14]: Will my reader have patience while I explain this to him a little ?
Parsing [sent. 6418 len. 20]: First , as he may have observed , my personal attraction is towards the poor rather than the rich .
Parsing [sent. 6419 len. 5]: I was made so .
Parsing [sent. 6420 len. 11]: I can generally get nearer the poor than the rich .
Parsing [sent. 6421 len. 26]: But I say GENERALLY , for I have known a few rich people quite as much to my mind as the best of the poor .
Parsing [sent. 6422 len. 20]: Thereupon , of course , their education would give them the advantage with me in the possibilities of communion .
Parsing [sent. 6423 len. 48]: But when the heart is right , and there is a good stock of common sense as well , -- a gift predominant , as far as I am aware , in no one class over another , education will turn the scale very gently with me .
Parsing [sent. 6424 len. 110]: And then when I reflect that some of these poor people would have made nobler ladies and gentlemen than all but two or three I know , if they had only had the opportunity , there is a reaction towards the poor , something like a feeling of favour because they have not had fair play -- a feeling soon modified , though not altered , by the reflection that they are such because God who loves them better than we do , has so ordered their lot , and by the recollection that not only was our Lord himself poor , but He said the poor were blessed .
Parsing [sent. 6425 len. 30]: And let me just say in passing that I not only believe it because He said it , but I believe it because I see that it is so .
Parsing [sent. 6426 len. 72]: I think sometimes that the world must have been especially created for the poor , and that particular allowances will be made for the rich because they are born into such disadvantages , and with their wickednesses and their miseries , their love of spiritual dirt and meanness , subserve the highest growth and emancipation of the poor , that they may inherit both the earth and the kingdom of heaven .
Parsing [sent. 6427 len. 11]: But I have been once more wandering from my subject .
Parsing [sent. 6428 len. 60]: Thus it was that the people in the village lying close to my door attracted most of my attention at first ; of which attention those more immediately associated with the village , as , for instance , the inhabitants of the Hall , came in for a share , although they did not belong to the same class .
Parsing [sent. 6429 len. 20]: Again , the houses of most of the gentlefolk lay considerably apart from the church and from each other .
Parsing [sent. 6430 len. 42]: Many of them went elsewhere to church , and I did not feel bound to visit those , for I had enough to occupy me without , and had little chance of getting a hold of them to do them good .
Parsing [sent. 6431 len. 32]: Still there were one or two families which I would have visited oftener , I confess , had I been more interested in them , or had I had a horse .
Parsing [sent. 6432 len. 14]: Therefore , I ought to have bought a horse sooner than I did .
Parsing [sent. 6433 len. 85]: Before this winter was over , however , I did buy one , partly to please Dr Duncan , who urged me to it for the sake of my health , partly because I could then do my duty better , and partly , I confess , from having been very fond of an old mare of my father 's , when I was a boy , living , after my mother 's death , at a farm of his in B -- shire .
Parsing [sent. 6434 len. 18]: Happening to come across a gray mare very much like her , I bought her at once .
Parsing [sent. 6435 len. 58]: I think it was the very day after the events recorded in my last chapter that I mounted her to pay a visit to two rich maiden ladies , whose carriage stopped at the Lych-gate most Sundays when the weather was favourable , but whom I had called upon only once since I came to the parish .
Parsing [sent. 6436 len. 40]: I should not have thought this visit worth mentioning , except for the conversation I had with them , during which a hint or two were dropped which had an influence in colouring my thoughts for some time after .
Parsing [sent. 6437 len. 42]: I was shown with much ceremony by a butler , as old apparently as his livery of yellow and green , into the presence of the two ladies , one of whom sat in state reading a volume of the Spectator .
Parsing [sent. 6438 len. 18]: She was very tall , and as square as the straight long-backed chair upon which she sat .
Parsing [sent. 6439 len. 12]: A fat asthmatic poodle lay at her feet upon the hearth-rug .
Parsing [sent. 6440 len. 45]: The other , a little lively gray-haired creature , who looked like a most ancient girl whom no power of gathering years would ever make old , was standing upon a high chair , making love to a demoniacal-looking cockatoo in a gilded cage .
Parsing [sent. 6441 len. 27]: As I entered the room , the latter all but jumped from her perch with a merry though wavering laugh , and advanced to meet me .
Parsing [sent. 6442 len. 17]: `` Jonathan , bring the cake and wine , '' she cried to the retreating servant .
Parsing [sent. 6443 len. 30]: The former rose with a solemn stiff-backedness , which was more amusing than dignified , and extended her hand as I approached her , without moving from her place .
Parsing [sent. 6444 len. 26]: `` We were afraid , Mr Walton , '' said the little lady , `` that you had forgotten we were parishioners of yours . ''
Parsing [sent. 6445 len. 21]: `` That I could hardly do , '' I answered , `` seeing you are such regular attendants at church .
Parsing [sent. 6446 len. 15]: But I confess I have given you ground for your rebuke , Miss Crowther .
Parsing [sent. 6447 len. 24]: I bought a horse , however , the other day , and this is the first use I have put him to . ''
Parsing [sent. 6448 len. 8]: `` We 're charmed to see you .
Parsing [sent. 6449 len. 17]: It is very good of you not to forget such uninteresting girls as we are . ''
Parsing [sent. 6450 len. 25]: `` You forget , Jemima , '' interposed her sister , in a feminine bass , `` that time is always on the wing .
Parsing [sent. 6451 len. 25]: I should have thought we were both decidedly middle-aged , though you are the elder by I will not say how many years . ''
Parsing [sent. 6452 len. 8]: `` All but ten years , Hester .
Parsing [sent. 6453 len. 11]: I remember rocking you in your cradle scores of times .
Parsing [sent. 6454 len. 19]: But somehow , Mr Walton , I ca n't help feeling as if she were my elder sister .
Parsing [sent. 6455 len. 19]: She is so learned , you see ; and I do n't read anything but the newspapers . ''
Parsing [sent. 6456 len. 7]: `` And your Bible , Jemima .
Parsing [sent. 6457 len. 5]: Do yourself justice . ''
Parsing [sent. 6458 len. 10]: `` That 's a matter of course , sister .
Parsing [sent. 6459 len. 12]: But this is not the way to entertain Mr Walton . ''
Parsing [sent. 6460 len. 15]: `` The gentlemen used to entertain the ladies when I was young , Jemima .
Parsing [sent. 6461 len. 14]: I do not know how it may have been when you were . ''
Parsing [sent. 6462 len. 10]: `` Much the same , I believe , sister .
Parsing [sent. 6463 len. 24]: But if you look at Mr Walton , I think you will see that he is pretty much entertained as it is . ''
Parsing [sent. 6464 len. 11]: `` I agree with Miss Hester , '' I said .
Parsing [sent. 6465 len. 11]: `` It is the duty of gentlemen to entertain ladies .
Parsing [sent. 6466 len. 22]: But it is so much the kinder of ladies when they surpass their duty , and condescend to entertain gentlemen . ''
Parsing [sent. 6467 len. 9]: `` What can surpass duty , Mr Walton ?
Parsing [sent. 6468 len. 14]: I confess I do not agree with your doctrines upon that point . ''
Parsing [sent. 6469 len. 15]: `` I do not quite understand you , Miss Hester , '' I returned .
Parsing [sent. 6470 len. 56]: `` Why , Mr Walton -- I hope you will not think me rude , but it always seems to me -- and it has given me much pain , when I consider that your congregation is chiefly composed of the lower classes , who may be greatly injured by such a style of preaching .
Parsing [sent. 6471 len. 10]: I must say I think so , Mr Walton .
Parsing [sent. 6472 len. 21]: Only perhaps you are one of those who think a lady 's opinion on such matters is worth nothing . ''
Parsing [sent. 6473 len. 30]: `` On the contrary , I respect an opinion just as far as the lady or gentleman who holds it seems to me qualified to have formed it first .
Parsing [sent. 6474 len. 17]: But you have not yet told me what you think so objectionable in my preaching . ''
Parsing [sent. 6475 len. 15]: `` You always speak as if faith in Christ was something greater than duty .
Parsing [sent. 6476 len. 9]: Now I think duty the first thing . ''
Parsing [sent. 6477 len. 10]: `` I quite agree with you , Miss Crowther .
Parsing [sent. 6478 len. 20]: For how can I , or any clergyman , urge a man to that which is not his duty ?
Parsing [sent. 6479 len. 12]: But tell me , is not faith in Christ a duty ?
Parsing [sent. 6480 len. 32]: Where you have mistaken me is , that you think I speak of faith as higher than duty , when indeed I speak of faith as higher than any OTHER duty .
Parsing [sent. 6481 len. 8]: It is the highest duty of man .
Parsing [sent. 6482 len. 17]: I do not say the duty he always sees clearest , or even sees at all .
Parsing [sent. 6483 len. 41]: But the fact is , that when that which is a duty becomes the highest delight of a man , the joy of his very being , he no more thinks or needs to think about it as a duty .
Parsing [sent. 6484 len. 44]: What would you think of the love of a son who , when an appeal was made to his affections , should say , ` Oh yes , I love my mother dearly : it is my duty , of course ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 6485 len. 24]: `` That sounds very plausible , Mr Walton ; but still I can not help feeling that you preach faith and not works .
Parsing [sent. 6486 len. 25]: I do not say that you are not to preach faith , of course ; but you know faith without works is dead . ''
Parsing [sent. 6487 len. 39]: `` Now , really , Hester , '' interposed Miss Jemima , `` I can not think how it is , but , for my part , I should have said that Mr Walton was constantly preaching works .
Parsing [sent. 6488 len. 11]: He 's always telling you to do something or other .
Parsing [sent. 6489 len. 30]: I know I always come out of the church with something on my mind ; and I 've got to work it off somehow before I 'm comfortable . ''
Parsing [sent. 6490 len. 27]: And here Miss Jemima got up on the chair again , and began to flirt with the cockatoo once more , but only in silent signs .
Parsing [sent. 6491 len. 16]: I can not quite recall how this part of the conversation drew to a close .
Parsing [sent. 6492 len. 29]: But I will tell a fact or two about the sisters which may possibly explain how it was that they took up such different notions of my preaching .
Parsing [sent. 6493 len. 25]: The elder scarce left the house , but spent almost the whole of her time in reading small dingy books of eighteenth century literature .
Parsing [sent. 6494 len. 25]: She believed in no other ; thought Shakespeare sentimental where he was not low , and Bacon pompous ; Addison thoroughly respectable and gentlemanly .
Parsing [sent. 6495 len. 11]: Pope was the great English poet , incomparably before Milton .
Parsing [sent. 6496 len. 29]: The `` Essay on Man '' contained the deepest wisdom ; the `` Rape of the Lock '' the most graceful imagination to be found in the language .
Parsing [sent. 6497 len. 39]: The `` Vicar of Wakefield '' was pretty , but foolish ; while in philosophy , Paley was perfect , especially in his notion of happiness , which she had heard objected to , and therefore warmly defended .
Parsing [sent. 6498 len. 21]: Somehow or other , respectability -- in position , in morals , in religion , in conduct -- was everything .
Parsing [sent. 6499 len. 33]: The consequence was that her very nature was old-fashioned , and had nothing in it of that lasting youth which is the birthright -- so often despised -- of every immortal being .
Parsing [sent. 6500 len. 16]: But I have already said more about her than her place in my story justifies .
Parsing [sent. 6501 len. 47]: Miss Crowther , on the contrary , whose eccentricities did not lie on the side of respectability , had gone on shocking the stiff proprieties of her younger sister till she could be shocked no more , and gave in as to the hopelessness of fate .
Parsing [sent. 6502 len. 84]: She had had a severe disappointment in youth , had not only survived it , but saved her heart alive out of it , losing only , as far as appeared to the eyes of her neighbours at least , any remnant of selfish care about herself ; and she now spent the love which had before been concentrated upon one object , upon every living thing that came near her , even to her sister 's sole favourite , the wheezing poodle .
Parsing [sent. 6503 len. 89]: She was very odd , it must be confessed , with her gray hair , her clear gray eye with wrinkled eyelids , her light step , her laugh at once girlish and cracked ; darting in and out of the cottages , scolding this matron with a lurking smile in every tone , hugging that baby , boxing the ears of the other little tyrant , passing this one 's rent , and threatening that other with awful vengeances , but it was a very lovely oddity .
Parsing [sent. 6504 len. 22]: Their property was not large , and she knew every living thing on the place down to the dogs and pigs .
Parsing [sent. 6505 len. 79]: And Miss Jemima , as the people always called her , transferring the MISS CROWTHER of primogeniture to the younger , who kept , like King Henry IV. , -- `` Her presence , like a robe pontifical , Ne'er seen but wonder 'd at , '' was the actual queen of the neighbourhood ; for , though she was the very soul of kindness , she was determined to have her own way , and had it .
Parsing [sent. 6506 len. 81]: Although I did not know all this at the time , such were the two ladies who held these different opinions about my preaching ; the one who did nothing but read Messrs Addison , Pope , Paley , and Co. , considering that I neglected the doctrine of works as the seal of faith , and the one who was busy helping her neighbours from morning to night , finding little in my preaching , except incentive to benevolence .
Parsing [sent. 6507 len. 26]: The next point where my recollection can take up the conversation , is where Miss Hester made the following further criticism on my pulpit labours .
Parsing [sent. 6508 len. 13]: `` You are too anxious to explain everything , Mr Walton . ''
Parsing [sent. 6509 len. 54]: I pause in my recording , to do my critic the justice of remarking that what she said looks worse on paper than it sounded from her lips ; for she was a gentlewoman , and the tone has much to do with the impression made by the intellectual contents of all speech .
Parsing [sent. 6510 len. 19]: `` Where can be the use of trying to make uneducated people see the grounds of everything ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6511 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 6512 len. 14]: `` It is enough that this or that is in the Bible . ''
Parsing [sent. 6513 len. 10]: `` Yes ; but there is just the point .
Parsing [sent. 6514 len. 6]: What is in the Bible ?
Parsing [sent. 6515 len. 7]: Is it this or that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6516 len. 16]: `` You are their spiritual instructor : tell them what is in the Bible . ''
Parsing [sent. 6517 len. 19]: `` But you have just been objecting to my mode of representing what is in the Bible . ''
Parsing [sent. 6518 len. 22]: `` It will be so much the worse , if you add argument to convince them of what is incorrect . ''
Parsing [sent. 6519 len. 5]: `` I doubt that .
Parsing [sent. 6520 len. 16]: Falsehood will expose itself the sooner that honest argument is used to support it . ''
Parsing [sent. 6521 len. 15]: `` You can not expect them to judge of what you tell them . ''
Parsing [sent. 6522 len. 12]: `` The Bible urges upon us to search and understand . ''
Parsing [sent. 6523 len. 15]: `` I grant that for those whose business it is , like yourself . ''
Parsing [sent. 6524 len. 35]: `` Do you think , then , that the Church consists of a few privileged to understand , and a great many who can not understand , and therefore need not be taught ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6525 len. 10]: `` I said you had to teach them . ''
Parsing [sent. 6526 len. 11]: `` But to teach is to make people understand . ''
Parsing [sent. 6527 len. 7]: `` I do n't think so .
Parsing [sent. 6528 len. 15]: If you come to that , how much can the wisest of us understand ?
Parsing [sent. 6529 len. 46]: You remember what Pope says , -- ` Superior beings , when of late they saw A mortal man unfold all Nature 's law , Admired such wisdom in an earthly shape , And show 'd a Newton as we show an ape ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6530 len. 8]: `` I do not know the passage .
Parsing [sent. 6531 len. 6]: Pope is not my Bible .
Parsing [sent. 6532 len. 12]: I should call such superior beings very inferior beings indeed . ''
Parsing [sent. 6533 len. 10]: `` Do you call the angels inferior beings ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6534 len. 7]: `` Such angels , certainly . ''
Parsing [sent. 6535 len. 11]: `` He means the good angels , of course . ''
Parsing [sent. 6536 len. 30]: `` And I say the good angels could never behave like that , for contempt is one of the lowest spiritual conditions in which any being can place himself .
Parsing [sent. 6537 len. 36]: Our Lord says , ` Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones , for their angels do always behold the face of my Father , who is in heaven . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 6538 len. 13]: `` Now will you even say that you understand that passage ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6539 len. 18]: `` Practically , well enough ; just as the poorest man of my congregation may understand it .
Parsing [sent. 6540 len. 11]: I am not to despise one of the little ones .
Parsing [sent. 6541 len. 11]: Pope represents the angels as despising a Newton even . ''
Parsing [sent. 6542 len. 7]: `` And you despise Pope . ''
Parsing [sent. 6543 len. 5]: `` I hope not .
Parsing [sent. 6544 len. 22]: I say he was full of despising , and therefore , if for no other reason , a small man . ''
Parsing [sent. 6545 len. 12]: `` Surely you do not jest at his bodily infirmities ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6546 len. 8]: `` I had forgotten them quite . ''
Parsing [sent. 6547 len. 12]: `` In every other sense he was a great man . ''
Parsing [sent. 6548 len. 7]: `` I can not allow it .
Parsing [sent. 6549 len. 14]: He was intellectually a great man , but morally a small man . ''
Parsing [sent. 6550 len. 9]: `` Such refinements are not easily followed . ''
Parsing [sent. 6551 len. 16]: `` I will undertake to make the poorest woman in my congregation understand that . ''
Parsing [sent. 6552 len. 13]: `` Why do n't you try your friend Mrs Oldcastle , then ?
Parsing [sent. 6553 len. 30]: It might do her a little good , '' said Miss Hester , now becoming , I thought , a little spiteful at hearing her favourite treated so unceremoniously .
Parsing [sent. 6554 len. 13]: I found afterwards that there was some kindness in it , however .
Parsing [sent. 6555 len. 18]: `` I should have very little influence with Mrs Oldcastle if I were to make the attempt .
Parsing [sent. 6556 len. 18]: But I am not called upon to address my flock individually upon every point of character . ''
Parsing [sent. 6557 len. 12]: `` I thought she was an intimate friend of yours . ''
Parsing [sent. 6558 len. 5]: `` Quite the contrary .
Parsing [sent. 6559 len. 6]: We are scarcely friendly . ''
Parsing [sent. 6560 len. 32]: `` I am very glad to hear it , '' said Miss Jemima , who had been silent during the little controversy that her sister and I had been carrying on .
Parsing [sent. 6561 len. 7]: `` We have been quite misinformed .
Parsing [sent. 6562 len. 21]: The fact is , we thought we might have seen more of you if it had not been for her .
Parsing [sent. 6563 len. 32]: And as very few people of her own position in society care to visit her , we thought it a pity she should be your principal friend in the parish . ''
Parsing [sent. 6564 len. 10]: `` Why do they not visit her more ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6565 len. 17]: `` There are strange stories about her , which it is as well to leave alone .
Parsing [sent. 6566 len. 8]: They are getting out of date too .
Parsing [sent. 6567 len. 16]: But she is not a fit woman to be regarded as the clergyman 's friend .
Parsing [sent. 6568 len. 3]: There ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6569 len. 22]: said Miss Jemima , as if she had wanted to relieve her bosom of a burden , and had done it .
Parsing [sent. 6570 len. 23]: `` I think , however , her religious opinions would correspond with your own , Mr Walton , '' said Miss Hester .
Parsing [sent. 6571 len. 20]: `` Possibly , '' I answered , with indifference ; `` I do n't care much about opinion . ''
Parsing [sent. 6572 len. 22]: `` Her daughter would be a nice girl , I fancy , if she were n't kept down by her mother .
Parsing [sent. 6573 len. 7]: She looks scared , poor thing !
Parsing [sent. 6574 len. 19]: And they say she 's not quite -- the thing , you know , '' said Miss Jemima .
Parsing [sent. 6575 len. 10]: `` What DO you mean , Miss Crowther ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6576 len. 9]: She gently tapped her forehead with a forefinger .
Parsing [sent. 6577 len. 3]: I laughed .
Parsing [sent. 6578 len. 19]: I thought it was not worth my while to enter as the champion of Miss Oldcastle 's sanity .
Parsing [sent. 6579 len. 28]: `` They are , and have been , a strange family as far back as I can remember ; and my mother used to say the same .
Parsing [sent. 6580 len. 10]: I am glad she comes to our church now .
Parsing [sent. 6581 len. 16]: You must n't let her set her cap at you , though , Mr Walton .
Parsing [sent. 6582 len. 7]: It would n't do at all .
Parsing [sent. 6583 len. 8]: She 's pretty enough , too ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6584 len. 13]: `` Yes , '' I returned , `` she is rather pretty .
Parsing [sent. 6585 len. 19]: But I do n't think she looks as if she had a cap to set at anybody . ''
Parsing [sent. 6586 len. 21]: I rose to go , for I did not relish any further pursuit of the conversation in the same direction .
Parsing [sent. 6587 len. 39]: I rode home slowly , brooding on the lovely marvel , that out of such a rough ungracious stem as the Oldcastle family , should have sprung such a delicate , pale , winter-braved flower , as Ethelwyn .
Parsing [sent. 6588 len. 36]: And I prayed that I might be honoured to rescue her from the ungenial soil and atmosphere to which the machinations of her mother threatened to confine her for the rest of a suffering life .
Parsing [sent. 6589 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXVI .
Parsing [sent. 6590 len. 4]: SATAN CAST OUT .
Parsing [sent. 6591 len. 56]: I was within a mile of the village , returning from my visit to the Misses Crowther , when my horse , which was walking slowly along the soft side of the road , lifted his head , and pricked up his ears at the sound , which he heard first , of approaching hoofs .
Parsing [sent. 6592 len. 16]: The riders soon came in sight -- Miss Oldcastle , Judy , and Captain Everard .
Parsing [sent. 6593 len. 10]: Miss Oldcastle I had never seen on horseback before .
Parsing [sent. 6594 len. 18]: Judy was on a little white pony she used to gallop about the fields near the Hall .
Parsing [sent. 6595 len. 22]: The Captain was laughing and chatting gaily as they drew near , now to the one , now to the other .
Parsing [sent. 6596 len. 31]: Being on my own side of the road I held straight on , not wishing to stop or to reveal the signs of a distress which had almost overwhelmed me .
Parsing [sent. 6597 len. 32]: I felt as cold as death , or rather as if my whole being had been deprived of vitality by a sudden exhaustion around me of the ethereal element of life .
Parsing [sent. 6598 len. 50]: I believe I did not alter my bearing , but remained with my head bent , for I had been thinking hard just before , till we were on the point of meeting , when I lifted my hat to Miss Oldcastle without drawing bridle , and went on .
Parsing [sent. 6599 len. 11]: The Captain returned my salutation , and likewise rode on .
Parsing [sent. 6600 len. 33]: I could just see , as they passed me , that Miss Oldcastle 's pale face was flushed even to scarlet , but she only bowed and kept alongside of her companion .
Parsing [sent. 6601 len. 35]: I thought I had escaped conversation , and had gone about twenty yards farther , when I heard the clatter of Judy 's pony behind me , and up she came at full gallop .
Parsing [sent. 6602 len. 15]: `` Why did n't you stop to speak to us , Mr Walton ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6603 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 6604 len. 12]: `` I pulled up , but you never looked at me .
Parsing [sent. 6605 len. 17]: We shall be cross all the rest of the day , because you cut us so .
Parsing [sent. 6606 len. 6]: What have we done ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6607 len. 19]: `` Nothing , Judy , that I know of , '' I answered , trying to speak cheerfully .
Parsing [sent. 6608 len. 21]: `` But I do not know your companion , and I was not in the humour for an introduction . ''
Parsing [sent. 6609 len. 23]: She looked hard at me with her keen gray eyes ; and I felt as if the child was seeing through me .
Parsing [sent. 6610 len. 14]: `` I do n't know what to make of it , Mr Walton .
Parsing [sent. 6611 len. 12]: You 're very different somehow from what you used to be .
Parsing [sent. 6612 len. 6]: There 's something wrong somewhere .
Parsing [sent. 6613 len. 15]: But I suppose you would all tell me it 's none of my business .
Parsing [sent. 6614 len. 7]: So I wo n't ask questions .
Parsing [sent. 6615 len. 11]: Only I wish I could do anything for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 6616 len. 18]: I felt the child 's kindness , but could only say -- `` Thank you , Judy .
Parsing [sent. 6617 len. 17]: I am sure I should ask you if there were anything you could do for me .
Parsing [sent. 6618 len. 8]: But you 'll be left behind . ''
Parsing [sent. 6619 len. 6]: `` No fear of that .
Parsing [sent. 6620 len. 11]: My Dobbin can go much faster than their big horses .
Parsing [sent. 6621 len. 13]: But I see you do n't want me , so good-bye . ''
Parsing [sent. 6622 len. 31]: She turned her pony 's head as she spoke , jumped the ditch at the side of the road , and flew after them along the grass like a swallow .
Parsing [sent. 6623 len. 31]: I likewise roused my horse and went off at a hard trot , with the vain impulse so to shake off the tormenting thoughts that crowded on me like gadflies .
Parsing [sent. 6624 len. 12]: But this day was to be one of more trial still .
Parsing [sent. 6625 len. 21]: As I turned a corner , almost into the street of the village , Tom Weir was at my side .
Parsing [sent. 6626 len. 8]: He had evidently been watching for me .
Parsing [sent. 6627 len. 16]: His face was so pale , that I saw in a moment something had happened .
Parsing [sent. 6628 len. 9]: `` What is the matter , Tom ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6629 len. 7]: I asked , in some alarm .
Parsing [sent. 6630 len. 28]: He did not reply for a moment , but kept unconsciously stroking my horse 's neck , and staring at me `` with wide blue eyes . ''
Parsing [sent. 6631 len. 18]: `` Come , Tom , '' I repeated , `` tell me what is the matter . ''
Parsing [sent. 6632 len. 24]: I could see his bare throat knot and relax , like the motion of a serpent , before he could utter the words .
Parsing [sent. 6633 len. 11]: `` Kate has killed her little boy , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 6634 len. 20]: He followed them with a stifled cry -- almost a scream , and hid his face in his hands .
Parsing [sent. 6635 len. 5]: `` God forbid ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6636 len. 21]: I exclaimed , and struck my heels in my horse 's sides , nearly overturning poor Tom in my haste .
Parsing [sent. 6637 len. 20]: `` She 's mad , sir ; she 's mad , '' he cried , as I rode off .
Parsing [sent. 6638 len. 16]: `` Come after me , '' I said , `` and take the mare home .
Parsing [sent. 6639 len. 11]: I sha n't be able to leave your sister . ''
Parsing [sent. 6640 len. 24]: Had I had a share , by my harsh words , in driving the woman beyond the bounds of human reason and endurance ?
Parsing [sent. 6641 len. 5]: The thought was dreadful .
Parsing [sent. 6642 len. 25]: But I must not let my mind rest on it now , lest I should be unfitted for what might have to be done .
Parsing [sent. 6643 len. 24]: Before I reached the door , I saw a little crowd of the villagers , mostly women and children , gathered about it .
Parsing [sent. 6644 len. 20]: I got off my horse , and gave him to a woman to hold till Tom should come up .
Parsing [sent. 6645 len. 35]: With a little difficulty , I prevailed on the rest to go home at once , and not add to the confusions and terrors of the unhappy affair by the excitement of their presence .
Parsing [sent. 6646 len. 26]: As soon as they had yielded to my arguments , I entered the shop , which to my annoyance I found full of the neighbours .
Parsing [sent. 6647 len. 25]: These likewise I got rid of as soon as possible , and locking the door behind them , went up to the room above .
Parsing [sent. 6648 len. 10]: To my surprise , I found no one there .
Parsing [sent. 6649 len. 14]: On the hearth and in the fender lay two little pools of blood .
Parsing [sent. 6650 len. 8]: All in the house was utterly still .
Parsing [sent. 6651 len. 5]: It was very dreadful .
Parsing [sent. 6652 len. 8]: I went to the only other door .
Parsing [sent. 6653 len. 12]: It was not bolted as I had expected to find it .
Parsing [sent. 6654 len. 10]: I opened it , peeped in , and entered .
Parsing [sent. 6655 len. 56]: On the bed lay the mother , white as death , but with her black eyes wide open , staring at the ceiling : and on her arm lay little Gerard , as white , except where the blood had flowed from the bandage that could not confine it , down his sweet deathlike face .
Parsing [sent. 6656 len. 16]: His eyes were fast closed , and he had no sign of life about him .
Parsing [sent. 6657 len. 12]: I shut the door behind me , and approached the bed .
Parsing [sent. 6658 len. 17]: When Catherine caught sight of me , she showed no surprise or emotion of any kind .
Parsing [sent. 6659 len. 19]: Her lips , with automaton-like movement , uttered the words -- `` I have done it at last .
Parsing [sent. 6660 len. 4]: I am ready .
Parsing [sent. 6661 len. 4]: Take me away .
Parsing [sent. 6662 len. 5]: I shall be hanged .
Parsing [sent. 6663 len. 5]: I do n't care .
Parsing [sent. 6664 len. 4]: I confess it .
Parsing [sent. 6665 len. 11]: Only do n't let the people stare at me . ''
Parsing [sent. 6666 len. 21]: Her lips went on moving , but I could hear no more till suddenly she broke out -- `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 6667 len. 3]: my baby !
Parsing [sent. 6668 len. 4]: my baby ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6669 len. 18]: and gave a cry of such agony as I hope never to hear again while I live .
Parsing [sent. 6670 len. 38]: At this moment I heard a loud knocking at the shop-door , which was the only entrance to the house , and remembering that I had locked it , I went down to see who was there .
Parsing [sent. 6671 len. 27]: I found Thomas Weir , the father , accompanied by Dr Duncan , whom , as it happened , he had had some difficulty in finding .
Parsing [sent. 6672 len. 40]: Thomas had sped to his daughter the moment he heard the rumour of what had happened , and his fierceness in clearing the shop had at least prevented the neighbours , even in his absence , from intruding further .
Parsing [sent. 6673 len. 9]: We went up together to Catherine 's room .
Parsing [sent. 6674 len. 29]: Thomas said nothing to me about what had happened , and I found it difficult even to conjecture from his countenance what thoughts were passing through his mind .
Parsing [sent. 6675 len. 21]: Catherine looked from one to another of us , as if she did not know the one from the other .
Parsing [sent. 6676 len. 31]: She made no motion to rise from her bed , nor did she utter a word , although her lips would now and then move as if moulding a sentence .
Parsing [sent. 6677 len. 40]: When Dr Duncan , after looking at the child , proceeded to take him from her , she gave him one imploring look , and yielded with a moan ; then began to stare hopelessly at the ceiling again .
Parsing [sent. 6678 len. 15]: The doctor carried the child into the next room , and the grandfather followed .
Parsing [sent. 6679 len. 11]: `` You see what you have driven me to ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6680 len. 12]: cried Catherine , the moment I was left alone with her .
Parsing [sent. 6681 len. 8]: `` I hope you are satisfied . ''
Parsing [sent. 6682 len. 8]: The words went to my very soul .
Parsing [sent. 6683 len. 51]: But when I looked at her , her eyes were wandering about over the ceiling , and I had and still have difficulty in believing that she spoke the words , and that they were not an illusion of my sense , occasioned by the commotion of my own feelings .
Parsing [sent. 6684 len. 19]: I thought it better , however , to leave her , and join the others in the sitting-room .
Parsing [sent. 6685 len. 31]: The first thing I saw there was Thomas on his knees , with a basin of water , washing away the blood of his grandson from his daughter 's floor .
Parsing [sent. 6686 len. 25]: The very sight of the child had hitherto been nauseous to him , and his daughter had been beyond the reach of his forgiveness .
Parsing [sent. 6687 len. 39]: Here was the end of it -- the blood of the one shed by the hand of the other , and the father of both , who had disdained both , on his knees , wiping it up .
Parsing [sent. 6688 len. 32]: Dr Duncan was giving the child brandy ; for he had found that he had been sick , and that the loss of blood was the chief cause of his condition .
Parsing [sent. 6689 len. 58]: The blood flowed from a wound on the head , extending backwards from the temple , which had evidently been occasioned by a fall upon the fender , where the blood lay both inside and out ; and the doctor took the sickness as a sign that the brain had not been seriously injured by the blow .
Parsing [sent. 6690 len. 16]: In a few minutes he said -- `` I think he 'll come round . ''
Parsing [sent. 6691 len. 12]: `` Will it be safe to tell his mother so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6692 len. 3]: I asked .
Parsing [sent. 6693 len. 9]: `` Yes : I think you may . ''
Parsing [sent. 6694 len. 6]: I hastened to her room .
Parsing [sent. 6695 len. 10]: `` Your little darling is not dead , Catherine .
Parsing [sent. 6696 len. 6]: He is coming to . ''
Parsing [sent. 6697 len. 26]: She THREW herself off the bed at my feet , caught them round with her arms , and cried -- `` I will forgive him .
Parsing [sent. 6698 len. 7]: I will do anything you like .
Parsing [sent. 6699 len. 5]: I forgive George Everard .
Parsing [sent. 6700 len. 12]: I will go and ask my father to forgive me . ''
Parsing [sent. 6701 len. 12]: I lifted her in my arms -- how light she was !
Parsing [sent. 6702 len. 21]: -- and laid her again on the bed , where she burst into tears , and lay sobbing and weeping .
Parsing [sent. 6703 len. 7]: I went to the other room .
Parsing [sent. 6704 len. 14]: Little Gerard opened his eyes and closed them again , as I entered .
Parsing [sent. 6705 len. 10]: The doctor had laid him in his own crib .
Parsing [sent. 6706 len. 7]: He said his pulse was improving .
Parsing [sent. 6707 len. 5]: I beckoned to Thomas .
Parsing [sent. 6708 len. 4]: He followed me .
Parsing [sent. 6709 len. 14]: `` She wants to ask you to forgive her , '' I said .
Parsing [sent. 6710 len. 26]: `` Do not , in God 's name , wait till she asks you , but go and tell her that you forgive her . ''
Parsing [sent. 6711 len. 13]: `` I dare not say I forgive her , '' he answered .
Parsing [sent. 6712 len. 13]: `` I have more need to ask her to forgive me . ''
Parsing [sent. 6713 len. 14]: I took him by the hand , and led him into her room .
Parsing [sent. 6714 len. 8]: She feebly lifted her arms towards him .
Parsing [sent. 6715 len. 9]: Not a word was said on either side .
Parsing [sent. 6716 len. 9]: I left them in each other 's embrace .
Parsing [sent. 6717 len. 26]: The hard rocks had been struck with the rod , and the waters of life had flowed forth from each , and had met between .
Parsing [sent. 6718 len. 42]: I have more than once known this in the course of my experience -- the ice and snow of a long estrangement suddenly give way , and the boiling geyser-floods of old affection rush from the hot deeps of the heart .
Parsing [sent. 6719 len. 73]: I think myself that the very lastingness and strength of animosity have their origin sometimes in the reality of affection : the love lasts all the while , freshly indignant at every new load heaped upon it ; till , at last , a word , a look , a sorrow , a gladness , sets it free ; and , forgetting all its claims , it rushes irresistibly towards its ends .
Parsing [sent. 6720 len. 9]: Thus was it with Thomas and Catherine Weir .
Parsing [sent. 6721 len. 16]: When I rejoined Dr Duncan , I found little Gerard asleep , and breathing quietly .
Parsing [sent. 6722 len. 14]: `` What do you know of this sad business , Mr Walton ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6723 len. 4]: said the doctor .
Parsing [sent. 6724 len. 16]: `` I should like to ask the same question of you , '' I returned .
Parsing [sent. 6725 len. 13]: `` Young Tom told me that his sister had murdered the child .
Parsing [sent. 6726 len. 7]: That is all I know . ''
Parsing [sent. 6727 len. 15]: `` His father told me the same ; and that is all I know .
Parsing [sent. 6728 len. 6]: Do you believe it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6729 len. 10]: `` At least we have no evidence about it .
Parsing [sent. 6730 len. 13]: It is tolerably certain neither of those two could have been present .
Parsing [sent. 6731 len. 8]: They must have received it by report .
Parsing [sent. 6732 len. 14]: We must wait till she is able to explain the thing herself . ''
Parsing [sent. 6733 len. 29]: `` Meantime , '' said Dr Duncan , `` all I believe is , that she struck the child , and that he fell upon the fender . ''
Parsing [sent. 6734 len. 26]: I may as well inform my reader that , as far as Catherine could give an account of the transaction , this conjecture was corroborated .
Parsing [sent. 6735 len. 38]: But the smallest reminder of it evidently filled her with such a horror of self-loathing , that I took care to avoid the subject entirely , after the attempt at explanation which she made at my request .
Parsing [sent. 6736 len. 11]: She could not remember with any clearness what had happened .
Parsing [sent. 6737 len. 68]: All she remembered was that she had been more miserable than ever in her life before ; that the child had come to her , as he seldom did , with some childish request or other ; that she felt herself seized with intense hatred of him ; and the next thing she knew was that his blood was running in a long red finger towards her .
Parsing [sent. 6738 len. 52]: Then it seemed as if that blood had been drawn from her own over-charged heart and brain ; she knew what she had done , though she did not know how she had done it ; and the tide of her ebbed affection flowed like the returning waters of the Solway .
Parsing [sent. 6739 len. 26]: But beyond her restored love , she remembered nothing more that happened till she lay weeping with the hope that the child would yet live .
Parsing [sent. 6740 len. 16]: Probably more particulars returned afterwards , but I took care to ask no more questions .
Parsing [sent. 6741 len. 47]: In the increase of illness that followed , I more than once saw her shudder while she slept , and thought she was dreaming what her waking memory had forgotten ; and once she started awake , crying , `` I have murdered him again . ''
Parsing [sent. 6742 len. 32]: To return to that first evening : -- When Thomas came from his daughter 's room , he looked like a man from whom the bitterness of evil had passed away .
Parsing [sent. 6743 len. 19]: To human eyes , at least , it seemed as if self had been utterly slain in him .
Parsing [sent. 6744 len. 55]: His face had that child-like expression in its paleness , and the tearfulness without tears haunting his eyes , which reminds one of the feeling of an evening in summer between which and the sultry day preceding it has fallen the gauzy veil of a cooling shower , with a rainbow in the east .
Parsing [sent. 6745 len. 9]: `` She is asleep , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 6746 len. 12]: `` How is it your daughter Mary is not here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6747 len. 3]: I asked .
Parsing [sent. 6748 len. 17]: `` She was taken with a fit the moment she heard the bad news , sir .
Parsing [sent. 6749 len. 8]: I left her with nobody but father .
Parsing [sent. 6750 len. 11]: I think I must go and look after her now .
Parsing [sent. 6751 len. 18]: It 's not the first she 's had neither , though I never told any one before .
Parsing [sent. 6752 len. 8]: You wo n't mention it , sir .
Parsing [sent. 6753 len. 14]: It makes people look shy at you , you know , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 6754 len. 9]: `` Indeed , I wo n't mention it .
Parsing [sent. 6755 len. 16]: -- Then she must n't sit up , and two nurses will be wanted here .
Parsing [sent. 6756 len. 10]: You and I must take it to-night , Thomas .
Parsing [sent. 6757 len. 35]: You 'll attend to your daughter , if she wants anything , and I know this little darling wo n't be frightened if he comes to himself , and sees me beside him . ''
Parsing [sent. 6758 len. 13]: `` God bless you , sir , '' said Thomas , fervently .
Parsing [sent. 6759 len. 15]: And from that hour to this there has never been a coolness between us .
Parsing [sent. 6760 len. 27]: `` A very good arrangement , '' said Dr Duncan ; `` only I feel as if I ought to have a share in it . ''
Parsing [sent. 6761 len. 9]: `` No , no , '' I said .
Parsing [sent. 6762 len. 10]: `` We do not know who may want you .
Parsing [sent. 6763 len. 10]: Besides , we are both younger than you . ''
Parsing [sent. 6764 len. 20]: `` I will come over early in the morning then , and see how you are going on . ''
Parsing [sent. 6765 len. 31]: As soon as Thomas returned with good news of Mary 's recovery , I left him , and went home to tell my sister , and arrange for the night .
Parsing [sent. 6766 len. 61]: We carried back with us what things we could think of to make the two patients as comfortable as possible ; for , as regarded Catherine , now that she would let her fellows help her , I was even anxious that she should feel something of that love about her which she had so long driven from her door .
Parsing [sent. 6767 len. 65]: I felt towards her somewhat as towards a new-born child , for whom this life of mingled weft must be made as soft as its material will admit of ; or rather , as if she had been my own sister , as indeed she was , returned from wandering in weary and miry ways , to taste once more the tenderness of home .
Parsing [sent. 6768 len. 19]: I wanted her to read the love of God in the love that even I could show her .
Parsing [sent. 6769 len. 62]: And , besides , I must confess that , although the result had been , in God 's great grace , so good , my heart still smote me for the severity with which I had spoken the truth to her ; and it was a relief to myself to endeavour to make some amends for having so spoken to her .
Parsing [sent. 6770 len. 59]: But I had no intention of going near her that night , for I thought the less she saw of me the better , till she should be a little stronger , and have had time , with the help of her renewed feelings , to get over the painful associations so long accompanying the thought of me .
Parsing [sent. 6771 len. 14]: So I took my place beside Gerard , and watched through the night .
Parsing [sent. 6772 len. 44]: The little fellow repeatedly cried out in that terror which is so often the consequence of the loss of blood ; but when I laid my hand on him , he smiled without waking , and lay quite still again for a while .
Parsing [sent. 6773 len. 30]: Once or twice he woke up , and looked so bewildered that I feared delirium ; but a little jelly composed him , and he fell fast asleep again .
Parsing [sent. 6774 len. 12]: He did not seem even to have headache from the blow .
Parsing [sent. 6775 len. 42]: But when I was left alone with the child , seated in a chair by the fire , my only light , how my thoughts rushed upon the facts bearing on my own history which this day had brought before me !
Parsing [sent. 6776 len. 19]: Horror it was to think of Miss Oldcastle even as only riding with the seducer of Catherine Weir .
Parsing [sent. 6777 len. 29]: There was torture in the thought of his touching her hand ; and to think that before the summer came once more , he might be her husband !
Parsing [sent. 6778 len. 32]: I will not dwell on the sufferings of that night more than is needful ; for even now , in my old age , I can not recall without renewing them .
Parsing [sent. 6779 len. 32]: But I must indicate one train of thought which kept passing through my mind with constant recurrence : -- Was it fair to let her marry such a man in ignorance ?
Parsing [sent. 6780 len. 13]: Would she marry him if she knew what I knew of him ?
Parsing [sent. 6781 len. 7]: Could I speak against my rival ?
Parsing [sent. 6782 len. 16]: -- blacken him even with the truth -- the only defilement that can really cling ?
Parsing [sent. 6783 len. 9]: Could I for my own dignity do so ?
Parsing [sent. 6784 len. 10]: And was she therefore to be sacrificed in ignorance ?
Parsing [sent. 6785 len. 11]: Might not some one else do it instead of me ?
Parsing [sent. 6786 len. 25]: But if I set it agoing , was it not precisely the same thing as if I did it myself , only more cowardly ?
Parsing [sent. 6787 len. 32]: There was but one way of doing it , and that was -- with the full and solemn consciousness that it was and must be a barrier between us for ever .
Parsing [sent. 6788 len. 31]: If I could give her up fully and altogether , then I might tell her the truth which was to preserve her from marrying such a man as my rival .
Parsing [sent. 6789 len. 24]: And I must do so , sooner than that she , my very dream of purity and gentle truth , should wed defilement .
Parsing [sent. 6790 len. 9]: But how bitter to cast away my CHANCE !
Parsing [sent. 6791 len. 13]: as I said , in the gathering despair of that black night .
Parsing [sent. 6792 len. 85]: And although every time I said it -- for the same words would come over and over as in a delirious dream -- I repeated yet again to myself that wonderful line of Spenser , -- `` It chanced -- eternal God that chance did guide , '' yet the words never grew into spirit in me ; they remained `` words , words , words , '' and meant nothing to my feeling -- hardly even to my judgment meant anything at all .
Parsing [sent. 6793 len. 54]: Then came another bitter thought , the bitterness of which was wicked : it flashed upon me that my own earnestness with Catherine Weir , in urging her to the duty of forgiveness , would bear a main part in wrapping up in secrecy that evil thing which ought not to be hid .
Parsing [sent. 6794 len. 34]: For had she not vowed -- with the same facts before her which now threatened to crush my heart into a lump of clay -- to denounce the man at the very altar ?
Parsing [sent. 6795 len. 14]: Had not the revenge which I had ignorantly combated been my best ally ?
Parsing [sent. 6796 len. 20]: And for one brief , black , wicked moment I repented that I had acted as I had acted .
Parsing [sent. 6797 len. 25]: The next I was on my knees by the side of the sleeping child , and had repented back again in shame and sorrow .
Parsing [sent. 6798 len. 17]: Then came the consolation that if I suffered hereby , I suffered from doing my duty .
Parsing [sent. 6799 len. 5]: And that was well .
Parsing [sent. 6800 len. 22]: Scarcely had I seated myself again by the fire when the door of the room opened softly , and Thomas appeared .
Parsing [sent. 6801 len. 20]: `` Kate is very strange , sir , '' he said , `` and wants to see you . ''
Parsing [sent. 6802 len. 5]: I rose at once .
Parsing [sent. 6803 len. 13]: `` Perhaps , then , you had better stay with Gerard . ''
Parsing [sent. 6804 len. 18]: `` I will , sir ; for I think she wants to speak to you alone . ''
Parsing [sent. 6805 len. 5]: I entered her chamber .
Parsing [sent. 6806 len. 34]: A candle stood on a chest of drawers , and its light fell on her face , once more flushed in those two spots with the glow of the unseen fire of disease .
Parsing [sent. 6807 len. 20]: Her eyes , too , glittered again , but the fierceness was gone , and only the suffering remained .
Parsing [sent. 6808 len. 12]: I drew a chair beside her , and took her hand .
Parsing [sent. 6809 len. 20]: She yielded it willingly , even returned the pressure of kindness which I offered to the thin trembling fingers .
Parsing [sent. 6810 len. 12]: `` You are too good , sir , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 6811 len. 8]: `` I want to tell you all .
Parsing [sent. 6812 len. 10]: He promised to marry me , I believed him .
Parsing [sent. 6813 len. 6]: But I did very wrong .
Parsing [sent. 6814 len. 21]: And I have been a bad mother , for I could not keep from seeing his face in Gerard 's .
Parsing [sent. 6815 len. 27]: Gerard was the name he told me to call him when I had to write to him , and so I named the little darling Gerard .
Parsing [sent. 6816 len. 7]: How is he , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6817 len. 8]: `` Doing nicely , '' I replied .
Parsing [sent. 6818 len. 16]: `` I do not think you need be at all uneasy about him now . ''
Parsing [sent. 6819 len. 4]: `` Thank God .
Parsing [sent. 6820 len. 10]: I forgive his father now with all my heart .
Parsing [sent. 6821 len. 14]: I feel it easier since I saw how wicked I could be myself .
Parsing [sent. 6822 len. 16]: And I feel it easier , too , that I have not long to live .
Parsing [sent. 6823 len. 15]: I forgive him with all my heart , and I will take no revenge .
Parsing [sent. 6824 len. 9]: I will not tell one who he is .
Parsing [sent. 6825 len. 8]: I have never told any one yet .
Parsing [sent. 6826 len. 6]: But I will tell you .
Parsing [sent. 6827 len. 9]: His name is George Everard -- Captain Everard .
Parsing [sent. 6828 len. 12]: I came to know him when I was apprenticed at Addicehead .
Parsing [sent. 6829 len. 21]: I would not tell you , sir , if I did not know that you will not tell any one .
Parsing [sent. 6830 len. 13]: I know you so well that I will not ask you not .
Parsing [sent. 6831 len. 11]: I saw him yesterday , and it drove me wild .
Parsing [sent. 6832 len. 7]: But it is all over now .
Parsing [sent. 6833 len. 7]: My heart feels so cool now .
Parsing [sent. 6834 len. 9]: Do you think God will forgive me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6835 len. 37]: Without one word of my own , I took out my pocket Testament and read these words : -- `` For if ye forgive men their trespasses , your heavenly Father will also forgive you . ''
Parsing [sent. 6836 len. 48]: Then I read to her , from the seventh chapter of St Luke 's Gospel , the story of the woman who was a sinner and came to Jesus in Simon 's house , that she might see how the Lord himself thought and felt about such .
Parsing [sent. 6837 len. 27]: When I had finished , I found that she was gently weeping , and so I left her , and resumed my place beside the boy .
Parsing [sent. 6838 len. 14]: I told Thomas that he had better not go near her just yet .
Parsing [sent. 6839 len. 45]: So we sat in silence together for a while , during which I felt so weary and benumbed , that I neither cared to resume my former train of thought , nor to enter upon the new one suggested by the confession of Catherine .
Parsing [sent. 6840 len. 23]: I believe I must have fallen asleep in my chair , for I suddenly returned to consciousness at a cry from Gerard .
Parsing [sent. 6841 len. 42]: I started up , and there was the child fast asleep , but standing on his feet in his crib , pushing with his hands from before him , as if resisting some one , and crying -- `` Do n't .
Parsing [sent. 6842 len. 3]: Do n't .
Parsing [sent. 6843 len. 5]: Go away , man .
Parsing [sent. 6844 len. 2]: Mammy !
Parsing [sent. 6845 len. 4]: Mr Walton ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6846 len. 29]: I took him in my arms , and kissed him , and laid him down again ; and he lay as still as if he had never moved .
Parsing [sent. 6847 len. 12]: At the same moment , Thomas came again into the room .
Parsing [sent. 6848 len. 34]: `` I am sorry to be so troublesome , sir , '' he said ; `` but my poor daughter says there is one thing more she wanted to say to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 6849 len. 5]: I returned at once .
Parsing [sent. 6850 len. 35]: As soon as I entered the room , she said eagerly : -- `` I forgive him -- I forgive him with all my heart ; but do n't let him take Gerard . ''
Parsing [sent. 6851 len. 33]: I assured her I would do my best to prevent any such attempt on his part , and making her promise to try to go to sleep , left her once more .
Parsing [sent. 6852 len. 12]: Nor was either of the patients disturbed again during the night .
Parsing [sent. 6853 len. 9]: Both slept , as it appeared , refreshingly .
Parsing [sent. 6854 len. 33]: In the morning , that is , before eight o'clock , the old doctor made his welcome appearance , and pronounced both quite as well as he had expected to find them .
Parsing [sent. 6855 len. 23]: In another hour , he had sent young Tom to take my place , and my sister to take his father 's .
Parsing [sent. 6856 len. 47]: I was determined that none of the gossips of the village should go near the invalid if I could help it ; for , though such might be kind-hearted and estimable women , their place was not by such a couch as that of Catherine Weir .
Parsing [sent. 6857 len. 64]: I enjoined my sister to be very gentle in her approaches to her , to be careful even not to seem anxious to serve her , and so to allow her to get gradually accustomed to her presence , not showing herself for the first day more than she could help , and yet taking good care she should have everything she wanted .
Parsing [sent. 6858 len. 33]: Martha seemed to understand me perfectly ; and I left her in charge with the more confidence that I knew Dr Duncan would call several times in the course of the day .
Parsing [sent. 6859 len. 54]: As for Tom , I had equal assurance that he would attend to orders ; and as Gerard was very fond of him , I dismissed all anxiety about both , and allowed my mind to return with fresh avidity to the contemplation of its own cares , and fears , and perplexities .
Parsing [sent. 6860 len. 19]: It was of no use trying to go to sleep , so I set out for a walk .
Parsing [sent. 6861 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXVII .
Parsing [sent. 6862 len. 6]: THE MAN AND THE CHILD .
Parsing [sent. 6863 len. 40]: It was a fine frosty morning , the invigorating influences of which , acting along with the excitement following immediately upon a sleepless night , overcame in a great measure the depression occasioned by the contemplation of my circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 6864 len. 53]: Disinclined notwithstanding for any more pleasant prospect , I sought the rugged common where I had so lately met Catherine Weir in the storm and darkness , and where I had stood without knowing it upon the very verge of the precipice down which my fate was now threatening to hurl me .
Parsing [sent. 6865 len. 39]: I reached the same chasm in which I had sought a breathing space on that night , and turning into it , sat down upon a block of sand which the frost had detached from the wall above .
Parsing [sent. 6866 len. 21]: And now the tumult began again in my mind , revolving around the vortex of a new centre of difficulty .
Parsing [sent. 6867 len. 109]: For , first of all , I found my mind relieved by the fact that , having urged Catherine to a line of conduct which had resulted in confession , -- a confession which , leaving all other considerations of my office out of view , had the greater claim upon my secrecy that it was made in confidence in my uncovenanted honour , -- I was not , could not be at liberty to disclose the secret she confided to me , which , disclosed by herself , would have been the revenge from which I had warned her , and at the same time my deliverance .
Parsing [sent. 6868 len. 58]: I was relieved I say at first , by this view of the matter , because I might thus keep my own chance of some favourable turn ; whereas , if I once told Miss Oldcastle , I must give her up for ever , as I had plainly seen in the watch of the preceding night .
Parsing [sent. 6869 len. 15]: But my love did not long remain skulking thus behind the hedge of honour .
Parsing [sent. 6870 len. 87]: Suddenly I woke and saw that I was unworthy of the honour of loving her , for that I was glad to be compelled to risk her well-being for the chance of my own happiness ; a risk which involved infinitely more wretchedness to her than the loss of my dearest hopes to me ; for it is one thing for a man not to marry the woman he loves , and quite another for a woman to marry a man she can not ever respect .
Parsing [sent. 6871 len. 76]: Had I not been withheld partly by my obligation to Catherine , partly by the feeling that I ought to wait and see what God would do , I should have risen that moment and gone straight to Oldcastle Hall , that I might plunge at once into the ocean of my loss , and encounter , with the full sense of honourable degradation , every misconstruction that might justly be devised of my conduct .
Parsing [sent. 6872 len. 19]: For that I had given her up first could never be known even to her in this world .
Parsing [sent. 6873 len. 14]: I could only save her by encountering and enduring and cherishing her scorn .
Parsing [sent. 6874 len. 62]: At least so it seemed to me at the time ; and , although I am certain the other higher motives had much to do in holding me back , I am equally certain that this awful vision of the irrevocable fate to follow upon the deed , had great influence , as well , in inclining me to suspend action .
Parsing [sent. 6875 len. 30]: I was still sitting in the hollow , when I heard the sound of horses ' hoofs in the distance , and felt a foreboding of what would appear .
Parsing [sent. 6876 len. 32]: I was only a few yards from the road upon which the sand-cleft opened , and could see a space of it sufficient to show the persons even of rapid riders .
Parsing [sent. 6877 len. 5]: The sounds drew nearer .
Parsing [sent. 6878 len. 16]: I could distinguish the step of a pony and the steps of two horses besides .
Parsing [sent. 6879 len. 28]: Up they came and swept past -- Miss Oldcastle upon Judy 's pony , and Mr Stoddart upon her horse ; with the captain upon his own .
Parsing [sent. 6880 len. 8]: How grateful I felt to Mr Stoddart !
Parsing [sent. 6881 len. 17]: And the hope arose in me that he had accompanied them at Miss Oldcastle 's request .
Parsing [sent. 6882 len. 21]: I had had no fear of being seen , sitting as I was on the side from which they came .
Parsing [sent. 6883 len. 30]: One of the three , however , caught a glimpse of me , and even in the moment ere she vanished I fancied I saw the lily-white grow rosy-red .
Parsing [sent. 6884 len. 23]: But it must have been fancy , for she could hardly have been quite pale upon horseback on such a keen morning .
Parsing [sent. 6885 len. 7]: I could not sit any longer .
Parsing [sent. 6886 len. 31]: As soon as I ceased to hear the sound of their progress , I rose and walked home -- much quieter in heart and mind than when I set out .
Parsing [sent. 6887 len. 20]: As I entered by the nearer gate of the vicarage , I saw Old Rogers enter by the farther .
Parsing [sent. 6888 len. 13]: He did not see me , but we met at the door .
Parsing [sent. 6889 len. 4]: I greeted him .
Parsing [sent. 6890 len. 19]: `` I 'm in luck , '' he said , `` to meet yer reverence just coming home .
Parsing [sent. 6891 len. 10]: How 's poor Miss Weir to-day , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6892 len. 21]: `` She was rather better , when I left her this morning , than she had been through the night .
Parsing [sent. 6893 len. 6]: I have not heard since .
Parsing [sent. 6894 len. 7]: I left my sister with her .
Parsing [sent. 6895 len. 11]: I greatly doubt if she will ever get up again .
Parsing [sent. 6896 len. 8]: That 's between ourselves , you know .
Parsing [sent. 6897 len. 4]: Come in . ''
Parsing [sent. 6898 len. 6]: `` Thank you , sir .
Parsing [sent. 6899 len. 10]: I wanted to have a little talk with you .
Parsing [sent. 6900 len. 20]: -- You do n't believe what they say -- that she tried to kill the poor little fellow ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6901 len. 14]: he asked , as soon as the study door was closed behind us .
Parsing [sent. 6902 len. 15]: `` If she did , she was out of her mind for the moment .
Parsing [sent. 6903 len. 8]: But I do n't believe it . ''
Parsing [sent. 6904 len. 15]: And thereupon I told him what both his master and I thought about it .
Parsing [sent. 6905 len. 15]: But I did not tell him what she had said confirmatory of our conclusions .
Parsing [sent. 6906 len. 21]: `` That 's just what I came to myself , sir , turning the thing over in my old head .
Parsing [sent. 6907 len. 12]: But there 's dreadful things done in the world , sir .
Parsing [sent. 6908 len. 16]: There 's my daughter been a-telling of me -- '' I was instantly breathless attention .
Parsing [sent. 6909 len. 23]: What he chose to tell me I felt at liberty to hear , though I would not have listened to Jane herself .
Parsing [sent. 6910 len. 48]: -- I must here mention that she and Richard were not yet married , old Mr Brownrigg not having yet consented to any day his son wished to fix ; and that she was , therefore , still in her place of attendance upon Miss Oldcastle . ''
Parsing [sent. 6911 len. 48]: -- There 's been my daughter a-telling of me , '' said Rogers , `` that the old lady up at the Hall there is tormenting the life out of that daughter of hers -- she do n't look much like hers , do she , sir ?
Parsing [sent. 6912 len. 12]: -- wanting to make her marry a man of her choosing .
Parsing [sent. 6913 len. 25]: I saw him go past o ' horseback with her yesterday , and I did n't more than half like the looks on him .
Parsing [sent. 6914 len. 22]: He 's too like a fair-spoken captain I sailed with once , what was the hardest man I ever sailed with .
Parsing [sent. 6915 len. 15]: His own way was everything , even after he saw it would n't do .
Parsing [sent. 6916 len. 16]: Now , do n't you think , sir , somebody or other ought to interfere ?
Parsing [sent. 6917 len. 21]: It 's as bad as murder that , and anybody has a right to do summat to perwent it . ''
Parsing [sent. 6918 len. 12]: `` I do n't know what can be done , Rogers .
Parsing [sent. 6919 len. 6]: I CA N'T interfere . ''
Parsing [sent. 6920 len. 6]: The old man was silent .
Parsing [sent. 6921 len. 10]: Evidently he thought I might interfere if I pleased .
Parsing [sent. 6922 len. 8]: I could see what he was thinking .
Parsing [sent. 6923 len. 16]: Possibly his daughter had told him something more than he chose to communicate to me .
Parsing [sent. 6924 len. 15]: I could not help suspecting the mode in which he judged I might interfere .
Parsing [sent. 6925 len. 15]: But I could see no likelihood before me but that of confusion and precipitation .
Parsing [sent. 6926 len. 13]: In a word , I had not a plain path to follow .
Parsing [sent. 6927 len. 17]: `` Old Rogers , '' I said , `` I can almost guess what you mean .
Parsing [sent. 6928 len. 20]: But I am in more difficulty with regard to what you suggest than I can easily explain to you .
Parsing [sent. 6929 len. 21]: I need not tell you , however , that I will turn the whole matter over in my mind . ''
Parsing [sent. 6930 len. 24]: `` The prey ought to be taken from the lion somehow , if it please God , '' returned the old man solemnly .
Parsing [sent. 6931 len. 34]: `` The poor young lady keeps up as well as she can before her mother ; but Jane do say there 's a power o ' crying done in her own room . ''
Parsing [sent. 6932 len. 35]: Partly to hide my emotion , partly with the sudden resolve to do something , if anything could be done , I said : -- `` I will call on Mr Stoddart this evening .
Parsing [sent. 6933 len. 14]: I may hear something from him to suggest a mode of action . ''
Parsing [sent. 6934 len. 15]: `` I do n't think you 'll get anything worth while from Mr Stoddart .
Parsing [sent. 6935 len. 9]: He takes things a deal too easy like .
Parsing [sent. 6936 len. 16]: He 'll be this man 's man and that man 's man both at oncet .
Parsing [sent. 6937 len. 7]: I beg your pardon , sir .
Parsing [sent. 6938 len. 8]: But HE wo n't help us . ''
Parsing [sent. 6939 len. 37]: `` That 's all I can think of at present , though , '' I said ; whereupon the man-of-war 's man , with true breeding , rose at once , and took a kindly leave .
Parsing [sent. 6940 len. 7]: I was in the storm again .
Parsing [sent. 6941 len. 10]: She suffering , resisting , and I standing aloof !
Parsing [sent. 6942 len. 6]: But what could I do ?
Parsing [sent. 6943 len. 10]: She had repelled me -- she would repel me .
Parsing [sent. 6944 len. 18]: Were I to dare to speak , and so be refused , the separation would be final .
Parsing [sent. 6945 len. 25]: She had said that the day might come when she would ask help from me : she had made no movement towards the request .
Parsing [sent. 6946 len. 24]: I would gladly die to serve her -- yea , more gladly far than live , if that service was to separate us .
Parsing [sent. 6947 len. 9]: But what to do I could not see .
Parsing [sent. 6948 len. 23]: Still , just to do something , even if a useless something , I would go and see Mr Stoddart that evening .
Parsing [sent. 6949 len. 27]: I was sure to find him alone , for he never dined with the family , and I might possibly catch a glimpse of Miss Oldcastle .
Parsing [sent. 6950 len. 47]: I found little Gerard so much better , though very weak , and his mother so quiet , notwithstanding great feverishness , that I might safely leave them to the care of Mary , who had quite recovered from her attack , and her brother Tom .
Parsing [sent. 6951 len. 11]: So there was something off my mind for the present .
Parsing [sent. 6952 len. 38]: The heavens were glorious with stars , -- Arcturus and his host , the Pleiades , Orion , and all those worlds that shine out when ours is dark ; but I did not care for them .
Parsing [sent. 6953 len. 11]: Let them shine : they could not shine into me .
Parsing [sent. 6954 len. 40]: I tried with feeble effort to lift my eyes to Him who is above the stars , and yet holds the sea , yea , the sea of human thought and trouble , in the hollow of His hand .
Parsing [sent. 6955 len. 37]: How much sustaining , although no conscious comforting , I got from that region `` Where all men 's prayers to Thee raised Return possessed of what they pray Thee , '' I can not tell .
Parsing [sent. 6956 len. 18]: It was not a time favourable to the analysis of feeling -- still less of religious feeling .
Parsing [sent. 6957 len. 15]: But somehow things did seem a little more endurable before I reached the house .
Parsing [sent. 6958 len. 39]: I was passing across the hall , following the `` white wolf '' to Mr Stoddart 's room , when the drawing-room door opened , and Miss Oldcastle came half out , but seeing me drew back instantly .
Parsing [sent. 6959 len. 16]: A moment after , however , I heard the sound of her dress following us .
Parsing [sent. 6960 len. 15]: Light as was her step , every footfall seemed to be upon my heart .
Parsing [sent. 6961 len. 18]: I did not dare to look round , for dread of seeing her turn away from me .
Parsing [sent. 6962 len. 35]: I felt like one under a spell , or in an endless dream ; but gladly would I have walked on for ever in hope , with that silken vortex of sound following me .
Parsing [sent. 6963 len. 7]: Soon , however , it ceased .
Parsing [sent. 6964 len. 19]: She had turned aside in some other direction , and I passed on to Mr Stoddart 's room .
Parsing [sent. 6965 len. 16]: He received me kindly , as he always did ; but his smile flickered uneasily .
Parsing [sent. 6966 len. 13]: He seemed in some trouble , and yet pleased to see me .
Parsing [sent. 6967 len. 14]: `` I am glad you have taken to horseback , '' I said .
Parsing [sent. 6968 len. 21]: `` It gives me hope that you will be my companion sometimes when I make a round of my parish .
Parsing [sent. 6969 len. 11]: I should like you to see some of our people .
Parsing [sent. 6970 len. 16]: You would find more in them to interest you than perhaps you would expect . ''
Parsing [sent. 6971 len. 15]: I thus tried to seem at ease , as I was far from feeling .
Parsing [sent. 6972 len. 19]: `` I am not so fond of riding as I used to be , '' returned Mr Stoddart .
Parsing [sent. 6973 len. 11]: `` Did you like the Arab horses in India ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6974 len. 12]: `` Yes , after I got used to their careless ways .
Parsing [sent. 6975 len. 19]: That horse you must have seen me on the other day , is very nearly a pure Arab .
Parsing [sent. 6976 len. 12]: He belongs to Captain Everard , and carries Miss Oldcastle beautifully .
Parsing [sent. 6977 len. 17]: I was quite sorry to take him from her , but it was her own doing .
Parsing [sent. 6978 len. 8]: She would have me go with her .
Parsing [sent. 6979 len. 13]: I think I have lost much firmness since I was ill . ''
Parsing [sent. 6980 len. 27]: `` If the loss of firmness means the increase of kindness , I do not think you will have to lament it , '' I answered .
Parsing [sent. 6981 len. 10]: `` Does Captain Everard make a long stay ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6982 len. 8]: `` He stays from day to day .
Parsing [sent. 6983 len. 6]: I wish he would go .
Parsing [sent. 6984 len. 8]: I do n't know what to do .
Parsing [sent. 6985 len. 26]: Mrs Oldcastle and he form one party in the house ; Miss Oldcastle and Judy another ; and each is trying to gain me over .
Parsing [sent. 6986 len. 9]: I do n't want to belong to either .
Parsing [sent. 6987 len. 9]: If they would only let me alone ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6988 len. 12]: `` What do they want of you , Mr Stoddart ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6989 len. 22]: `` Mrs Oldcastle wants me to use my influence with Ethelwyn , to persuade her to behave differently to Captain Everard .
Parsing [sent. 6990 len. 40]: The old lady has set her heart on their marriage , and Ethelwyn , though she dares not break with him , she is so much afraid of her mother , yet keeps him somehow at arm 's length .
Parsing [sent. 6991 len. 13]: Then Judy is always begging me to stand up for her aunt .
Parsing [sent. 6992 len. 31]: But what 's the use of my standing up for her if she wo n't stand up for herself ; she never says a word to me about it herself .
Parsing [sent. 6993 len. 7]: It 's all Judy 's doing .
Parsing [sent. 6994 len. 10]: How am I to know what she wants ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6995 len. 16]: `` I thought you said just now she asked you to ride with her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6996 len. 9]: `` So she did , but nothing more .
Parsing [sent. 6997 len. 32]: She did not even press it , only the tears came in her eyes when I refused , and I could not bear that ; so I went against my will .
Parsing [sent. 6998 len. 8]: I do n't want to make enemies .
Parsing [sent. 6999 len. 13]: I am sure I do n't see why she should stand out .
Parsing [sent. 7000 len. 15]: He 's a very good match in point of property and family too . ''
Parsing [sent. 7001 len. 9]: `` Perhaps she does not like him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7002 len. 6]: I forced myself to say .
Parsing [sent. 7003 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 7004 len. 12]: I suppose not , or she would not be so troublesome .
Parsing [sent. 7005 len. 17]: But she could arrange all that if she were inclined to be agreeable to her friends .
Parsing [sent. 7006 len. 8]: After all I have done for her !
Parsing [sent. 7007 len. 16]: Well , one must not look to be repaid for anything one does for others .
Parsing [sent. 7008 len. 20]: I used to be very fond of her : I am getting quite tired of her miserable looks . ''
Parsing [sent. 7009 len. 11]: And what had this man done for her , then ?
Parsing [sent. 7010 len. 39]: He had , for his own amusement , taught her Hindostanee ; he had given her some insight into the principles of mechanics , and he had roused in her some taste for the writings of the Mystics .
Parsing [sent. 7011 len. 42]: But for all that regarded the dignity of her humanity and her womanhood , if she had had no teaching but what he gave her , her mind would have been merely `` an unweeded garden that grows to seed . ''
Parsing [sent. 7012 len. 42]: And now he complained that in return for his pains she would not submit to the degradation of marrying a man she did not love , in order to leave him in the enjoyment of his own lazy and cowardly peace .
Parsing [sent. 7013 len. 12]: Really he was a worse man than I had thought him .
Parsing [sent. 7014 len. 27]: Clearly he would not help to keep her in the right path , not even interfere to prevent her from being pushed into the wrong one .
Parsing [sent. 7015 len. 25]: But perhaps he was only expressing his own discomfort , not giving his real judgment , and I might be censuring him too hardly .
Parsing [sent. 7016 len. 12]: `` What will be the result , do you suppose ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7017 len. 3]: I asked .
Parsing [sent. 7018 len. 6]: `` I ca n't tell .
Parsing [sent. 7019 len. 13]: Sooner or later she will have to give in to her mother .
Parsing [sent. 7020 len. 3]: Everybody does .
Parsing [sent. 7021 len. 11]: She might as well yield with a good grace . ''
Parsing [sent. 7022 len. 13]: `` She must do what she thinks right , '' I said .
Parsing [sent. 7023 len. 17]: `` And you , Mr Stoddart , ought to help her to do what is right .
Parsing [sent. 7024 len. 16]: You surely would not urge her to marry a man she did not love . ''
Parsing [sent. 7025 len. 10]: `` Well , no ; not exactly urge her .
Parsing [sent. 7026 len. 9]: And yet society does not object to it .
Parsing [sent. 7027 len. 10]: It is an acknowledged arrangement , common enough . ''
Parsing [sent. 7028 len. 11]: `` Society is scarcely an interpreter of the divine will .
Parsing [sent. 7029 len. 25]: Society will honour vile things enough , so long as the doer has money sufficient to clothe them in a grace not their own .
Parsing [sent. 7030 len. 26]: There is a God 's - way of doing everything in the world , up to marrying , or down to paying a bill . ''
Parsing [sent. 7031 len. 19]: `` Yes , yes , I know what you would say ; and I suppose you are right .
Parsing [sent. 7032 len. 9]: I will not urge any opinion of mine .
Parsing [sent. 7033 len. 23]: Besides , we shall have a little respite soon , for he must join his regiment in a day or two . ''
Parsing [sent. 7034 len. 8]: It was some relief to hear this .
Parsing [sent. 7035 len. 24]: But I could not with equanimity prosecute a conversation having Miss Oldcastle for the subject of it , and presently took my leave .
Parsing [sent. 7036 len. 35]: As I walked through one of the long passages , but dimly lighted , leading from Mr Stoddart 's apartment to the great staircase , I started at a light touch on my arm .
Parsing [sent. 7037 len. 7]: It was from Judy 's hand .
Parsing [sent. 7038 len. 12]: `` Dear Mr Walton -- '' she said , and stopped .
Parsing [sent. 7039 len. 64]: For at the same moment appeared at the farther end of the passage towards which I had been advancing , a figure of which little more than a white face was visible ; and the voice of Sarah , through whose softness always ran a harsh thread that made it unmistakable , said , `` Miss Judy , your grandmamma wants you . ''
Parsing [sent. 7040 len. 29]: Judy took her hand from my arm , and with an almost martial stride the little creature walked up to the speaker , and stood before her defiantly .
Parsing [sent. 7041 len. 23]: I could see them quite well in the fuller light at the end of the passage , where there stood a lamp .
Parsing [sent. 7042 len. 31]: I followed slowly that I might not interrupt the child 's behaviour , which moved me strangely in contrast with the pusillanimity I had so lately witnessed in Mr Stoddart .
Parsing [sent. 7043 len. 21]: `` Sarah , '' she said , `` you know you are telling a lie Grannie does NOT want me .
Parsing [sent. 7044 len. 15]: You have NOT been in the dining-room since I left it one moment ago .
Parsing [sent. 7045 len. 19]: Do you think , you BAD woman , _ I _ am going to be afraid of you ?
Parsing [sent. 7046 len. 8]: I know you better than you think .
Parsing [sent. 7047 len. 11]: Go away directly , or I will make you . ''
Parsing [sent. 7048 len. 20]: She stamped her little foot , and the `` white wolf '' turned and walked away without a word .
Parsing [sent. 7049 len. 39]: If the mothers among my readers are shocked at the want of decorum in my friend Judy , I would just say , that valuable as propriety of demeanour is , truth of conduct is infinitely more precious .
Parsing [sent. 7050 len. 37]: Glad should I be to think that the even tenor of my children 's good manners could never be interrupted , except by such righteous indignation as carried Judy beyond the strict bounds of good breeding .
Parsing [sent. 7051 len. 17]: Nor could I find it in my heart to rebuke her wherein she had been wrong .
Parsing [sent. 7052 len. 44]: In the face of her courage and uprightness , the fault was so insignificant that it would have been giving it an altogether undue importance to allude to it at all , and might weaken her confidence in my sympathy with her rectitude .
Parsing [sent. 7053 len. 26]: When I joined her she put her hand in mine , and so walked with me down the stair and out at the front door .
Parsing [sent. 7054 len. 17]: `` You will take cold , Judy , going out like that , '' I said .
Parsing [sent. 7055 len. 16]: `` I am in too great a passion to take cold , '' she answered .
Parsing [sent. 7056 len. 13]: `` But I have no time to talk about that creeping creature .
Parsing [sent. 7057 len. 26]: -- Auntie DOES N'T like Captain Everard ; and grannie keeps insisting on it that she shall have him whether she likes him or not .
Parsing [sent. 7058 len. 9]: Now do tell me what you think . ''
Parsing [sent. 7059 len. 12]: `` I do not quite understand you , my child . ''
Parsing [sent. 7060 len. 12]: `` I know auntie would like to know what you think .
Parsing [sent. 7061 len. 10]: But I know she will never ask you herself .
Parsing [sent. 7062 len. 26]: So _ I _ am asking you whether a lady ought to marry a gentleman she does not like , to please her mother . ''
Parsing [sent. 7063 len. 6]: `` Certainly not , Judy .
Parsing [sent. 7064 len. 12]: It is often wicked , and at best a mistake . ''
Parsing [sent. 7065 len. 7]: `` Thank you , Mr Walton .
Parsing [sent. 7066 len. 5]: I will tell her .
Parsing [sent. 7067 len. 15]: She will be glad to hear that you say so , I know . ''
Parsing [sent. 7068 len. 11]: `` Mind you tell her you asked me , Judy .
Parsing [sent. 7069 len. 16]: I should not like her to think I had been interfering , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 7070 len. 10]: `` Yes , yes ; I know quite well .
Parsing [sent. 7071 len. 5]: I will take care .
Parsing [sent. 7072 len. 3]: Thank you .
Parsing [sent. 7073 len. 5]: He 's going to-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 7074 len. 4]: Good night . ''
Parsing [sent. 7075 len. 15]: She bounded into the house again , and I walked away down the avenue .
Parsing [sent. 7076 len. 25]: I saw and felt the stars now , for hope had come again in my heart , and I thanked the God of hope .
Parsing [sent. 7077 len. 16]: `` Our minds are small because they are faithless , '' I said to myself .
Parsing [sent. 7078 len. 24]: `` If we had faith in God , as our Lord tells us , our hearts would share in His greatness and peace .
Parsing [sent. 7079 len. 19]: For we should not then be shut up in ourselves , but would walk abroad in Him . ''
Parsing [sent. 7080 len. 13]: And with a light step and a light heart I went home .
Parsing [sent. 7081 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXVIII .
Parsing [sent. 7082 len. 4]: OLD MRS TOMKINS .
Parsing [sent. 7083 len. 25]: Very severe weather came , and much sickness followed , chiefly amongst the poorer people , who can so ill keep out the cold .
Parsing [sent. 7084 len. 23]: Yet some of my well-to-do parishioners were laid up likewise -- amongst others Mr Boulderstone , who had an attack of pleurisy .
Parsing [sent. 7085 len. 97]: I had grown quite attached to Mr Boulderstone by this time , not because he was what is called interesting , for he was not ; not because he was clever , for he was not ; not because he was well-read , for he was not ; not because he was possessed of influence in the parish , though he had that influence ; but simply because he was true ; he was what he appeared , felt what he professed , did what he said ; appearing kind , and feeling and acting kindly .
Parsing [sent. 7086 len. 23]: Such a man is rare and precious , were he as stupid as the Welsh giant in `` Jack the Giant-Killer . ''
Parsing [sent. 7087 len. 20]: I could never see Mr Boulderstone a mile off , but my heart felt the warmer for the sight .
Parsing [sent. 7088 len. 24]: Even in his great pain he seemed to forget himself as he received me , and to gain comfort from my mere presence .
Parsing [sent. 7089 len. 33]: I could not help regarding him as a child of heaven , to be treated with the more reverence that he had the less aid to his goodness from his slow understanding .
Parsing [sent. 7090 len. 42]: It seemed to me that the angels might gather with reverence around such a man , to watch the gradual and tardy awakening of the intellect in one in whom the heart and the conscience had been awake from the first .
Parsing [sent. 7091 len. 19]: The latter safe , they at least would see well that there was no fear for the former .
Parsing [sent. 7092 len. 16]: Intelligence is a consequence of love ; nor is there any true intelligence without it .
Parsing [sent. 7093 len. 91]: But I could not help feeling keenly the contrast when I went from his warm , comfortable , well-defended chamber , in which every appliance that could alleviate suffering or aid recovery was at hand , like a castle well appointed with arms and engines against the inroads of winter and his yet colder ally Death , -- when , I say , I went from his chamber to the cottage of the Tomkinses , and found it , as it were , lying open and bare to the enemy .
Parsing [sent. 7094 len. 31]: What holes and cracks there were about the door , through which the fierce wind rushed at once into the room to attack the aged feet and hands and throats !
Parsing [sent. 7095 len. 56]: There were no defences of threefold draperies , and no soft carpet on the brick floor , -- only a small rug which my sister had carried them laid down before a weak-eyed little fire , that seemed to despair of making anything of it against the huge cold that beleaguered and invaded the place .
Parsing [sent. 7096 len. 11]: True , we had had the little cottage patched up .
Parsing [sent. 7097 len. 110]: The two Thomas Weirs had been at work upon it for a whole day and a half in the first of the cold weather this winter ; but it was like putting the new cloth on the old garment , for fresh places had broken out , and although Mrs Tomkins had fought the cold well with what rags she could spare , and an old knife , yet such razor-edged winds are hard to keep out , and here she was now , lying in bed , and breathing hard , like the sore-pressed garrison which had retreated to its last defence , the keep of the castle .
Parsing [sent. 7098 len. 10]: Poor old Tomkins sat shivering over the little fire .
Parsing [sent. 7099 len. 7]: `` Come , come , Tomkins !
Parsing [sent. 7100 len. 37]: this wo n't do , '' I said , as I caught up a broken shovel that would have let a lump as big as one 's fist through a hole in the middle of it .
Parsing [sent. 7101 len. 13]: `` Why do n't you burn your coals in weather like this ?
Parsing [sent. 7102 len. 7]: Where do you keep them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7103 len. 28]: It made my heart ache to see the little heap in a box hardly bigger than the chest of tea my sister brought from London with her .
Parsing [sent. 7104 len. 11]: I threw half of it on the fire at once .
Parsing [sent. 7105 len. 7]: `` Deary me , Mr Walton !
Parsing [sent. 7106 len. 6]: you ARE wasteful , sir .
Parsing [sent. 7107 len. 14]: The Lord never sent His good coals to be used that way . ''
Parsing [sent. 7108 len. 11]: `` He did though , Tomkins , '' I answered .
Parsing [sent. 7109 len. 17]: `` And He 'll send you a little more this evening , after I get home .
Parsing [sent. 7110 len. 6]: Keep yourself warm , man .
Parsing [sent. 7111 len. 11]: This world 's cold in winter , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 7112 len. 9]: `` Indeed , sir , I know that .
Parsing [sent. 7113 len. 11]: And I 'm like to know it worse afore long .
Parsing [sent. 7114 len. 23]: She 's going , '' he said , pointing over his shoulder with his thumb towards the bed where his wife lay .
Parsing [sent. 7115 len. 5]: I went to her .
Parsing [sent. 7116 len. 24]: I had seen her several times within the last few weeks , but had observed nothing to make me consider her seriously ill .
Parsing [sent. 7117 len. 11]: I now saw at a glance that Tomkins was right .
Parsing [sent. 7118 len. 7]: She had not long to live .
Parsing [sent. 7119 len. 18]: `` I am sorry to see you suffering so much , Mrs Tomkins , '' I said .
Parsing [sent. 7120 len. 28]: `` I do n't suffer so wery much , sir ; though to be sure it be hard to get the breath into my body , sir .
Parsing [sent. 7121 len. 9]: And I do feel cold-like , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 7122 len. 16]: `` I 'm going home directly , and I 'll send you down another blanket .
Parsing [sent. 7123 len. 11]: It 's much colder to-day than it was yesterday . ''
Parsing [sent. 7124 len. 12]: `` It 's not weather-cold , sir , wi ' me .
Parsing [sent. 7125 len. 6]: It 's grave-cold , sir .
Parsing [sent. 7126 len. 10]: Blankets wo n't do me no good , sir .
Parsing [sent. 7127 len. 40]: I ca n't get it out of my head how perishing cold I shall be when I 'm under the mould , sir ; though I ought n't to mind it when it 's the will o ' God .
Parsing [sent. 7128 len. 10]: It 's only till the resurrection , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 7129 len. 14]: `` But it 's not the will of God , Mrs Tomkins . ''
Parsing [sent. 7130 len. 7]: `` Ai n't it , sir ?
Parsing [sent. 7131 len. 7]: Sure I thought it was . ''
Parsing [sent. 7132 len. 15]: `` You believe in Jesus Christ , do n't you , Mrs Tomkins ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7133 len. 15]: `` That I do , sir , with all my heart and soul . ''
Parsing [sent. 7134 len. 17]: `` Well , He says that whosoever liveth and believeth in Him shall never die . ''
Parsing [sent. 7135 len. 11]: `` But , you know , sir , everybody dies .
Parsing [sent. 7136 len. 13]: I MUST die , and be laid in the churchyard , sir .
Parsing [sent. 7137 len. 10]: And that 's what I do n't like . ''
Parsing [sent. 7138 len. 10]: `` But I say that is all a mistake .
Parsing [sent. 7139 len. 5]: YOU wo n't die .
Parsing [sent. 7140 len. 33]: Your body will die , and be laid away out of sight ; but you will be awake , alive , more alive than you are now , a great deal . ''
Parsing [sent. 7141 len. 21]: And here let me interrupt the conversation to remark upon the great mistake of teaching children that they have souls .
Parsing [sent. 7142 len. 18]: The consequence is , that they think of their souls as of something which is not themselves .
Parsing [sent. 7143 len. 10]: For what a man HAS can not be himself .
Parsing [sent. 7144 len. 24]: Hence , when they are told that their souls go to heaven , they think of their SELVES as lying in the grave .
Parsing [sent. 7145 len. 22]: They ought to be taught that they have bodies ; and that their bodies die ; while they themselves live on .
Parsing [sent. 7146 len. 21]: Then they will not think , as old Mrs Tomkins did , that THEY will be laid in the grave .
Parsing [sent. 7147 len. 34]: It is making altogether too much of the body , and is indicative of an evil tendency to materialism , that we talk as if we POSSESSED souls , instead of BEING souls .
Parsing [sent. 7148 len. 38]: We should teach our children to think no more of their bodies when dead than they do of their hair when it is cut off , or of their old clothes when they have done with them .
Parsing [sent. 7149 len. 10]: `` Do you really think so , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7150 len. 5]: `` Indeed I do .
Parsing [sent. 7151 len. 11]: I do n't know anything about where you will be .
Parsing [sent. 7152 len. 16]: But you will be with God -- in your Father 's house , you know .
Parsing [sent. 7153 len. 10]: And that is enough , is it not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7154 len. 7]: `` Yes , surely , sir .
Parsing [sent. 7155 len. 19]: But I wish you was to be there by the bedside of me when I was a-dyin ' .
Parsing [sent. 7156 len. 11]: I ca n't help bein ' summat skeered at it .
Parsing [sent. 7157 len. 12]: It do n't come nat ` ral to me , like .
Parsing [sent. 7158 len. 35]: I ha ' got used to this old bed here , cold as it has been -- many 's the night -- wi ' my good man there by the side of me . ''
Parsing [sent. 7159 len. 24]: `` Send for me , Mrs Tomkins , any moment , day or night , and I 'll be with you directly . ''
Parsing [sent. 7160 len. 40]: `` I think , sir , if I had a hold ov you i ' the one hand , and my man there , the Lord bless him , i ' the other , I could go comfortable . ''
Parsing [sent. 7161 len. 39]: `` I 'll come the minute you send for me -- just to keep you in mind that a better friend than I am is holding you all the time , though you may n't feel His hands .
Parsing [sent. 7162 len. 78]: If it is some comfort to have hold of a human friend , think that a friend who is more than man , a divine friend , has a hold of you , who knows all your fears and pains , and sees how natural they are , and can just with a word , or a touch , or a look into your soul , keep them from going one hair 's - breadth too far .
Parsing [sent. 7163 len. 24]: He loves us up to all out need , just because we need it , and He is all love to give . ''
Parsing [sent. 7164 len. 17]: `` But I ca n't help thinking , sir , that I would n't be troublesome .
Parsing [sent. 7165 len. 9]: He has such a deal to look after !
Parsing [sent. 7166 len. 18]: And I do n't see how He can think of everybody , at every minute , like .
Parsing [sent. 7167 len. 12]: I do n't mean that He will let anything go wrong .
Parsing [sent. 7168 len. 16]: But He might forget an old body like me for a minute , like . ''
Parsing [sent. 7169 len. 20]: `` You would need to be as wise as He is before you could see how He does it .
Parsing [sent. 7170 len. 10]: But you must believe more than you can understand .
Parsing [sent. 7171 len. 9]: It is only common sense to do so .
Parsing [sent. 7172 len. 32]: Think how nonsensical it would be to suppose that one who could make everything , and keep the whole going as He does , should n't be able to help forgetting .
Parsing [sent. 7173 len. 20]: It would be unreasonable to think that He must forget because you could n't understand how He could remember .
Parsing [sent. 7174 len. 44]: I think it is as hard for Him to forget anything as it is for us to remember everything ; for forgetting comes of weakness , and from our not being finished yet , and He is all strength and all perfection . ''
Parsing [sent. 7175 len. 13]: `` Then you think , sir , He never forgets anything ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7176 len. 23]: I knew by the trouble that gathered on the old woman 's brow what kind of thought was passing through her mind .
Parsing [sent. 7177 len. 15]: But I let her go on , thinking so to help her the better .
Parsing [sent. 7178 len. 20]: She paused for one moment only , and then resumed -- much interrupted by the shortness of her breathing .
Parsing [sent. 7179 len. 22]: `` When I was brought to bed first , '' she said , `` it was o ' twins , sir .
Parsing [sent. 7180 len. 3]: And oh !
Parsing [sent. 7181 len. 7]: sir , it was VERY hard .
Parsing [sent. 7182 len. 79]: As I said to my man after I got my head up a bit , ` Tomkins , ' says I , ` you do n't know what it is to have TWO on 'em cryin ' and cryin ' , and you next to nothin ' to give 'em ; till their cryin ' sticks to your brain , and ye hear 'em when they 're fast asleep , one on each side o ' you . '
Parsing [sent. 7183 len. 29]: Well , sir , I 'm ashamed to confess it even to you ; and what the Lord can think of me , I do n't know . ''
Parsing [sent. 7184 len. 39]: `` I would rather confess to Him than to the best friend I ever had , '' I said ; `` I am so sure that He will make every excuse for me that ought to be made .
Parsing [sent. 7185 len. 9]: And a friend ca n't always do that .
Parsing [sent. 7186 len. 8]: He ca n't know all about it .
Parsing [sent. 7187 len. 16]: And you ca n't tell him all , because you do n't know all yourself .
Parsing [sent. 7188 len. 4]: He does . ''
Parsing [sent. 7189 len. 11]: `` But I would like to tell YOU , sir .
Parsing [sent. 7190 len. 12]: Would you believe it , sir , I wished 'em dead ?
Parsing [sent. 7191 len. 19]: Just to get the wailin ' of them out o ' my head , I wished 'em dead .
Parsing [sent. 7192 len. 24]: In the courtyard o ' the squire 's house , where my Tomkins worked on the home-farm , there was an old draw-well .
Parsing [sent. 7193 len. 29]: It was n't used , and there was a lid to it , with a hole in it , through which you could put a good big stone .
Parsing [sent. 7194 len. 30]: And Tomkins once took me to it , and , without tellin ' me what it was , he put a stone in , and told me to hearken .
Parsing [sent. 7195 len. 16]: And I hearkened , but I heard nothing , -- as I told him so .
Parsing [sent. 7196 len. 13]: ` But , ' says he , ` hearken , lass . '
Parsing [sent. 7197 len. 16]: And in a little while there come a blast o ' noise like from somewheres .
Parsing [sent. 7198 len. 8]: ` What 's that , Tomkins ? '
Parsing [sent. 7199 len. 3]: I said .
Parsing [sent. 7200 len. 24]: ` That 's the ston ' , ' says he , ' a strikin ' on the water down that there well . '
Parsing [sent. 7201 len. 10]: And I turned sick at the thought of it .
Parsing [sent. 7202 len. 25]: And it 's down there that I wished the darlin 's that God had sent me ; for there they 'd be quiet . ''
Parsing [sent. 7203 len. 17]: `` Mothers are often a little out of their minds at such times , Mrs Tomkins .
Parsing [sent. 7204 len. 6]: And so were you . ''
Parsing [sent. 7205 len. 8]: `` I do n't know , sir .
Parsing [sent. 7206 len. 8]: But I must tell you another thing .
Parsing [sent. 7207 len. 30]: The Sunday afore that , the parson had been preachin ' about ` Suffer little children , ' you know , sir , ` to come unto me . '
Parsing [sent. 7208 len. 42]: I suppose that was what put it in my head ; but I fell asleep wi ' nothin ' else in my head but the cries o ' the infants and the sound o ' the ston ' in the draw-well .
Parsing [sent. 7209 len. 58]: And I dreamed that I had one o ' them under each arm , cryin ' dreadful , and was walkin ' across the court the way to the draw-well ; when all at once a man come up to me and held out his two hands , and said , ` Gie me my childer . '
Parsing [sent. 7210 len. 8]: And I was in a terrible fear .
Parsing [sent. 7211 len. 68]: And I gave him first one and then the t ` other , and he took them , and one laid its head on one shoulder of him , and t ` other upon t ` other , and they stopped their cryin ' , and fell fast asleep ; and away he walked wi ' them into the dark , and I saw him no more .
Parsing [sent. 7212 len. 13]: And then I awoke cryin ' , I did n't know why .
Parsing [sent. 7213 len. 22]: And I took my twins to me , and my breasts was full , if ye 'll excuse me , sir .
Parsing [sent. 7214 len. 12]: And my heart was as full o ' love to them .
Parsing [sent. 7215 len. 9]: And they hardly cried worth mentionin ' again .
Parsing [sent. 7216 len. 19]: But afore they was two year old , they both died o ' the brown chytis , sir .
Parsing [sent. 7217 len. 9]: And I think that He took them . ''
Parsing [sent. 7218 len. 18]: `` He did take them , Mrs Tomkins ; and you 'll see them again soon . ''
Parsing [sent. 7219 len. 17]: `` But , if He never forgets anything -- '' `` I did n't say that .
Parsing [sent. 7220 len. 9]: I think He can do what He pleases .
Parsing [sent. 7221 len. 14]: And if He pleases to forget anything , then He can forget it .
Parsing [sent. 7222 len. 32]: And I think that is what He does with our sins -- that is , after He has got them away from us , once we are clean from them altogether .
Parsing [sent. 7223 len. 24]: It would be a dreadful thing if He forgot them before that , and left them sticking fast to us and defiling us .
Parsing [sent. 7224 len. 9]: How then should we ever be made clean ?
Parsing [sent. 7225 len. 23]: -- What else does the prophet Isaiah mean when he says , ` Thou hast cast my sins behind Thy back ? '
Parsing [sent. 7226 len. 14]: Is not that where He does not choose to see them any more ?
Parsing [sent. 7227 len. 15]: They are not pleasant to Him to think of any more than to us .
Parsing [sent. 7228 len. 37]: It is as if He said -- ' I will not think of that any more , for my sister will never do it again , ' and so He throws it behind His back . ''
Parsing [sent. 7229 len. 8]: `` They ARE good words , sir .
Parsing [sent. 7230 len. 17]: I could not bear Him to think of me and my sins both at once . ''
Parsing [sent. 7231 len. 25]: I could not help thinking of the words of Macbeth , `` To know my deed , ` twere best not know myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 7232 len. 65]: The old woman lay quiet after this , relieved in mind , though not in body , by the communication she had made with so much difficulty , and I hastened home to send some coals and other things , and then call upon Dr Duncan , lest he should not know that his patient was so much worse as I had found her .
Parsing [sent. 7233 len. 17]: From Dr Duncan 's I went to see old Samuel Weir , who likewise was ailing .
Parsing [sent. 7234 len. 10]: The bitter weather was telling chiefly upon the aged .
Parsing [sent. 7235 len. 11]: I found him in bed , under the old embroidery .
Parsing [sent. 7236 len. 9]: No one was in the room with him .
Parsing [sent. 7237 len. 30]: He greeted me with a withered smile , sweet and true , although no flash of white teeth broke forth to light up the welcome of the aged head .
Parsing [sent. 7238 len. 10]: `` Are you not lonely , Mr Weir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7239 len. 5]: `` No , sir .
Parsing [sent. 7240 len. 11]: I do n't know as ever I was less lonely .
Parsing [sent. 7241 len. 25]: I 've got my stick , you see , sir , '' he said , pointing to a thorn stick which lay beside him .
Parsing [sent. 7242 len. 25]: `` I do not quite understand you , '' I returned , knowing that the old man 's gently humorous sayings always meant something .
Parsing [sent. 7243 len. 31]: `` You see , sir , when I want anything , I 've only got to knock on the floor , and up comes my son out of the shop .
Parsing [sent. 7244 len. 24]: And then again , when I knock at the door of the house up there , my Father opens it and looks out .
Parsing [sent. 7245 len. 24]: So I have both my son on earth and my Father in heaven , and what can an old man want more ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7246 len. 12]: `` What , indeed , could any one want more ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7247 len. 47]: `` It 's very strange , '' the old man resumed after a pause , `` but as I lie here , after I 've had my tea , and it is almost dark , I begin to feel as if I was a child again .
Parsing [sent. 7248 len. 68]: -- They say old age is a second childhood ; but before I grew so old , I used to think that meant only that a man was helpless and silly again , as he used to be when he was a child : I never thought it meant that a man felt like a child again , as light-hearted and untroubled as I do now . ''
Parsing [sent. 7249 len. 17]: `` Well , I suspect that is not what people do mean when they say so .
Parsing [sent. 7250 len. 22]: But I am very glad -- you do n't know how pleased it makes me to hear that you feel so .
Parsing [sent. 7251 len. 15]: I will hope to fare in the same way when my time comes . ''
Parsing [sent. 7252 len. 17]: `` Indeed , I hope you will , sir ; for I am main and happy .
Parsing [sent. 7253 len. 43]: Just before you came in now , I had really forgotten that I was a toothless old man , and thought I was lying here waiting for my mother to come in and say good-night to me before I went to sleep .
Parsing [sent. 7254 len. 21]: Was n't that curious , when I never saw my mother , as I told you before , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7255 len. 7]: `` It was very curious . ''
Parsing [sent. 7256 len. 9]: `` But I have no end of fancies .
Parsing [sent. 7257 len. 25]: Only when I begin to think about it , I can always tell when they are fancies , and they never put me out .
Parsing [sent. 7258 len. 27]: There 's one I see often -- a man down on his knees at that cupboard nigh the floor there , searching and searching for somewhat .
Parsing [sent. 7259 len. 20]: And I wish he would just turn round his face once for a moment that I might see him .
Parsing [sent. 7260 len. 12]: I have a notion always it 's my own father . ''
Parsing [sent. 7261 len. 15]: `` How do you account for that fancy , now , Mr Weir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7262 len. 18]: `` I 've often thought about it , sir , but I never could account for it .
Parsing [sent. 7263 len. 19]: I 'm none willing to think it 's a ghost ; for what 's the good of it ?
Parsing [sent. 7264 len. 21]: I 've turned out that cupboard over and over , and there 's nothing there I do n't know . ''
Parsing [sent. 7265 len. 12]: `` You 're not afraid of it , are you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7266 len. 5]: `` No , sir .
Parsing [sent. 7267 len. 5]: Why should I be ?
Parsing [sent. 7268 len. 7]: I never did it no harm .
Parsing [sent. 7269 len. 13]: And God can surely take care of me from all sorts . ''
Parsing [sent. 7270 len. 22]: My readers must not think anything is going to come out of this strange illusion of the old man 's brain .
Parsing [sent. 7271 len. 76]: I questioned him a little more about it , and came simply to the conclusion , that when he was a child he had found the door open and had wandered into the house , at the time uninhabited , had peeped in at the door of the same room where he now lay , and had actually seen a man in the position he described , half in the cupboard , searching for something .
Parsing [sent. 7272 len. 27]: His mind had kept the impression after the conscious memory had lost its hold of the circumstance , and now revived it under certain physical conditions .
Parsing [sent. 7273 len. 17]: It was a glimpse out of one of the many stories which haunted the old mansion .
Parsing [sent. 7274 len. 21]: But there he lay like a child , as he said , fearless even of such usurpations upon his senses .
Parsing [sent. 7275 len. 15]: I think instances of quiet unSELFconscious faith are more common than is generally supposed .
Parsing [sent. 7276 len. 25]: Few have along with it the genial communicative impulse of old Samuel Weir , which gives the opportunity of seeing into their hidden world .
Parsing [sent. 7277 len. 22]: He seemed to have been , and to have remained , a child , in the best sense of the word .
Parsing [sent. 7278 len. 44]: He had never had much trouble with himself , for he was of a kindly , gentle , trusting nature ; and his will had never been called upon to exercise any strong effort to enable him to walk in the straight path .
Parsing [sent. 7279 len. 64]: Nor had his intellect , on the other hand , while capable enough , ever been so active as to suggest difficulties to his faith , leaving him , even theoretically , far nearer the truth than those who start objections for their own sakes , liking to feel themselves in a position of supposed antagonism to the generally acknowledged sources of illumination .
Parsing [sent. 7280 len. 98]: For faith is in itself a light that lightens even the intellect , and hence the shield of the complete soldier of God , the shield of faith , is represented by Spenser as `` framed all of diamond , perfect , pure , and clean , '' -LRB- the power of the diamond to absorb and again radiate light being no poetic fiction , but a well-known scientific fact , -RRB- whose light falling upon any enchantment or false appearance , destroys it utterly : for `` all that was not such as seemed in sight .
Parsing [sent. 7281 len. 11]: Before that shield did fade , and suddaine fall . ''
Parsing [sent. 7282 len. 11]: Old Rogers had passed through a very much larger experience .
Parsing [sent. 7283 len. 21]: Many more difficulties had come to him , and he had met them in his own fashion and overcome them .
Parsing [sent. 7284 len. 67]: For while there is such a thing as truth , the mind that can honestly beget a difficulty must at the same time be capable of receiving that light of the truth which annihilates the difficulty , or at least of receiving enough to enable it to foresee vaguely some solution , for a full perception of which the intellect may not be as yet competent .
Parsing [sent. 7285 len. 62]: By every such victory Old Rogers had enlarged his being , ever becoming more childlike and faithful ; so that , while the childlikeness of Weir was the childlikeness of a child , that of Old Rogers was the childlikeness of a man , in which submission to God is not only a gladness , but a conscious will and choice .
Parsing [sent. 7286 len. 56]: But as the safety of neither depended on his own feelings , but on the love of God who was working in him , we may well leave all such differences of nature and education to the care of Him who first made the men different , and then brought different conditions out of them .
Parsing [sent. 7287 len. 29]: The one thing is , whether we are letting God have His own way with us , following where He leads , learning the lessons He gives us .
Parsing [sent. 7288 len. 14]: I wished that Mr Stoddart had been with me during these two visits .
Parsing [sent. 7289 len. 66]: Perhaps he might have seen that the education of life was a marvellous thing , and , even in the poorest intellectual results , far more full of poetry and wonder than the outcome of that constant watering with the watering-pot of self-education which , dissociated from the duties of life and the influences of his fellows , had made of him what he was .
Parsing [sent. 7290 len. 10]: But I doubt if he would have seen it .
Parsing [sent. 7291 len. 36]: A week had elapsed from the night I had sat up with Gerard Weir , and his mother had not risen from her bed , nor did it seem likely she would ever rise again .
Parsing [sent. 7292 len. 18]: On a Friday I went to see her , just as the darkness was beginning to gather .
Parsing [sent. 7293 len. 10]: The fire of life was burning itself out fast .
Parsing [sent. 7294 len. 18]: It glowed on her cheeks , it burned in her hands , it blazed in her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 7295 len. 8]: But the fever had left her mind .
Parsing [sent. 7296 len. 11]: That was cool , oh , so cool , now !
Parsing [sent. 7297 len. 17]: Those fierce tropical storms of passion had passed away , and nothing of life was lost .
Parsing [sent. 7298 len. 14]: Revenge had passed away , but revenge is of death , and deadly .
Parsing [sent. 7299 len. 19]: Forgiveness had taken its place , and forgiveness is the giving , and so the receiving of life .
Parsing [sent. 7300 len. 45]: Gerard , his dear little head starred with sticking-plaster , sat on her bed , looking as quietly happy as child could look , over a wooden horse with cylindrical body and jointless legs , covered with an eruption of red and black spots .
Parsing [sent. 7301 len. 23]: -- Is it the ignorance or the imagination of children that makes them so easily pleased with the merest hint at representation ?
Parsing [sent. 7302 len. 15]: I suspect the one helps the other towards that most desirable result , satisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 7303 len. 56]: -- But he dropped it when he saw me , in a way so abandoning that -- comparing small things with great -- it called to my mind those lines of Milton : -- `` From his slack hand the garland wreathed for Eve , Down dropt , and all the faded roses shed . ''
Parsing [sent. 7304 len. 18]: The quiet child FLUNG himself upon my neck , and the mother 's face gleamed with pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 7305 len. 5]: `` Dear boy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7306 len. 16]: I said , `` I am very glad to see you so much better . ''
Parsing [sent. 7307 len. 15]: For this was the first time he had shown such a revival of energy .
Parsing [sent. 7308 len. 18]: He had been quite sweet when he saw me , but , until this evening , listless .
Parsing [sent. 7309 len. 15]: `` Yes , '' he said , `` I am quite well now . ''
Parsing [sent. 7310 len. 10]: And he put his hand up to his head .
Parsing [sent. 7311 len. 6]: `` Does it ache ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7312 len. 5]: `` Not much now .
Parsing [sent. 7313 len. 10]: The doctor says I had a bad fall . ''
Parsing [sent. 7314 len. 8]: `` So you had , my child .
Parsing [sent. 7315 len. 9]: But you will soon be well again . ''
Parsing [sent. 7316 len. 23]: The mother 's face was turned aside , yet I could see one tear forcing its way from under her closed eyelid .
Parsing [sent. 7317 len. 13]: `` Oh , I do n't mind it , '' he answered .
Parsing [sent. 7318 len. 8]: `` Mammy is so kind to me !
Parsing [sent. 7319 len. 14]: She lets me sit on her bed as long as I like . ''
Parsing [sent. 7320 len. 5]: `` That IS nice .
Parsing [sent. 7321 len. 10]: But just run to auntie in the next room .
Parsing [sent. 7322 len. 16]: I think your mammy would like to talk to me for a little while . ''
Parsing [sent. 7323 len. 13]: The child hurried off the bed , and ran with overflowing obedience .
Parsing [sent. 7324 len. 21]: `` I can even think of HIM now , '' said the mother , `` without going into a passion .
Parsing [sent. 7325 len. 7]: I hope God will forgive him .
Parsing [sent. 7326 len. 5]: _ I _ do .
Parsing [sent. 7327 len. 8]: I think He will forgive me . ''
Parsing [sent. 7328 len. 21]: `` Did you ever hear , '' I asked , `` of Jesus refusing anybody that wanted kindness from Him ?
Parsing [sent. 7329 len. 43]: He would n't always do exactly what they asked Him , because that would sometimes be of no use , and sometimes would even be wrong ; but He never pushed them away from Him , never repulsed their approach to Him .
Parsing [sent. 7330 len. 38]: For the sake of His disciples , He made the Syrophenician woman suffer a little while , but only to give her such praise afterwards and such a granting of her prayer as is just wonderful . ''
Parsing [sent. 7331 len. 22]: She said nothing for a little while ; then murmured , `` Shall I have to be ashamed to all eternity ?
Parsing [sent. 7332 len. 27]: I do not want not to be ashamed ; but shall I never be able to be like other people -- in heaven I mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7333 len. 17]: `` If He is satisfied with you , you need not think anything more about yourself .
Parsing [sent. 7334 len. 26]: If He lets you once kiss His feet , you wo n't care to think about other people 's opinion of you even in heaven .
Parsing [sent. 7335 len. 10]: But things will go very differently there from here .
Parsing [sent. 7336 len. 26]: For everybody there will be more or less ashamed of himself , and will think worse of himself than he does of any one else .
Parsing [sent. 7337 len. 62]: If trouble about your past life were to show itself on your face there , they would all run to comfort you , trying to make the best of it , and telling you that you must think about yourself as He thinks about you ; for what He thinks is the rule , because it is the infallible right way .
Parsing [sent. 7338 len. 29]: But perhaps rather , they would tell you to leave that to Him who has taken away our sins , and not trouble yourself any more about it .
Parsing [sent. 7339 len. 29]: But to tell the truth , I do n't think such thoughts will come to you at all when once you have seen the face of Jesus Christ .
Parsing [sent. 7340 len. 28]: You will be so filled with His glory and goodness and grace , that you will just live in Him and not in yourself at all . ''
Parsing [sent. 7341 len. 12]: `` Will He let us tell Him anything we please ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7342 len. 22]: `` He lets you do that now : surely He will not be less our God , our friend there . ''
Parsing [sent. 7343 len. 14]: `` Oh , I do n't mind how soon He takes me now !
Parsing [sent. 7344 len. 14]: Only there 's that poor child that I 've behaved so badly to !
Parsing [sent. 7345 len. 9]: I wish I could take him with me .
Parsing [sent. 7346 len. 13]: I have no time to make it up to him here . ''
Parsing [sent. 7347 len. 8]: `` You must wait till he comes .
Parsing [sent. 7348 len. 8]: He wo n't think hardly of you .
Parsing [sent. 7349 len. 8]: There 's no fear of that . ''
Parsing [sent. 7350 len. 9]: `` What will become of him , though ?
Parsing [sent. 7351 len. 14]: I ca n't bear the idea of burdening my father with him . ''
Parsing [sent. 7352 len. 13]: `` Your father will be glad to have him , I know .
Parsing [sent. 7353 len. 13]: He will feel it a privilege to do something for your sake .
Parsing [sent. 7354 len. 8]: But the boy will do him good .
Parsing [sent. 7355 len. 14]: If he does not want him , I will take him myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 7356 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 7357 len. 9]: thank you , thank you , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 7358 len. 6]: A burst of tears followed .
Parsing [sent. 7359 len. 12]: `` He has often done me good , '' I said .
Parsing [sent. 7360 len. 5]: `` Who , sir ?
Parsing [sent. 7361 len. 4]: My father ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7362 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 7363 len. 4]: Your son . ''
Parsing [sent. 7364 len. 13]: `` I do n't quite understand what you mean , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 7365 len. 8]: `` I mean just what I say .
Parsing [sent. 7366 len. 20]: The words and behaviour of your lovely boy have both roused and comforted my heart again and again . ''
Parsing [sent. 7367 len. 6]: She burst again into tears .
Parsing [sent. 7368 len. 7]: `` That is good to hear .
Parsing [sent. 7369 len. 7]: To think of your saying that !
Parsing [sent. 7370 len. 5]: The poor little innocent !
Parsing [sent. 7371 len. 8]: Then it is n't all punishment ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7372 len. 12]: `` If it were ALL punishment , we should perish utterly .
Parsing [sent. 7373 len. 31]: He is your punishment ; but look in what a lovely loving form your punishment has come , and say whether God has been good to you or not . ''
Parsing [sent. 7374 len. 18]: `` If I had only received my punishment humbly , things would have been very different now .
Parsing [sent. 7375 len. 23]: But I do take it -- at least I want to take it -- just as He would have me take it .
Parsing [sent. 7376 len. 7]: I will bear anything He likes .
Parsing [sent. 7377 len. 7]: I suppose I must die ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7378 len. 10]: `` I think He means you to die now .
Parsing [sent. 7379 len. 10]: You are ready for it now , I think .
Parsing [sent. 7380 len. 20]: You have wanted to die for a long time ; but you were not ready for it before . ''
Parsing [sent. 7381 len. 11]: `` And now I want to live for my boy .
Parsing [sent. 7382 len. 7]: But His will be done . ''
Parsing [sent. 7383 len. 3]: `` Amen .
Parsing [sent. 7384 len. 11]: There is no such prayer in the universe as that .
Parsing [sent. 7385 len. 8]: It means everything best and most beautiful .
Parsing [sent. 7386 len. 11]: Thy will , O God , evermore be done . ''
Parsing [sent. 7387 len. 4]: She lay silent .
Parsing [sent. 7388 len. 7]: A tap came to the chamber-door .
Parsing [sent. 7389 len. 14]: It was Mary , who nursed her sister and attended to the shop .
Parsing [sent. 7390 len. 28]: `` If you please , sir , here 's a little girl come to say that Mrs Tomkins is dying , and wants to see you . ''
Parsing [sent. 7391 len. 11]: `` Then I must say good-night to you , Catherine .
Parsing [sent. 7392 len. 7]: I will see you to-morrow morning .
Parsing [sent. 7393 len. 96]: Think about old Mrs Tomkins ; she 's a good old soul ; and when you find your heart drawn to her in the trouble of death , then lift it up to God for her , that He will please to comfort and support her , and make her happier than health -- stronger than strength , taking off the old worn garment of her body , and putting upon her the garment of salvation , which will be a grand new body , like that the Saviour had when He rose again . ''
Parsing [sent. 7394 len. 5]: `` I will try .
Parsing [sent. 7395 len. 7]: I will think about her . ''
Parsing [sent. 7396 len. 16]: For I thought this would be a help to prepare her for her own death .
Parsing [sent. 7397 len. 12]: In thinking lovingly about others , we think healthily about ourselves .
Parsing [sent. 7398 len. 40]: And the things she thought of for the comfort of Mrs Tomkins , would return to comfort herself in the prospect of her own end , when perhaps she might not be able to think them out for herself .
Parsing [sent. 7399 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXIX .
Parsing [sent. 7400 len. 4]: CALM AND STORM .
Parsing [sent. 7401 len. 12]: But of the two , Catherine had herself to go first .
Parsing [sent. 7402 len. 31]: Again and again was I sent for to say farewell to Mrs Tomkins , and again and again I returned home leaying her asleep , and for the time better .
Parsing [sent. 7403 len. 69]: But on a Saturday evening , as I sat by my vestry-fire , pondering on many things , and trying to make myself feel that they were as God saw them and not as they appeared to me , young Tom came to me with the news that his sister seemed much worse , and his father would be much obliged if I would go and see her .
Parsing [sent. 7404 len. 13]: I sent Tom on before , because I wished to follow alone .
Parsing [sent. 7405 len. 20]: It was a brilliant starry night ; no moon , no clouds , no wind , nothing but stars .
Parsing [sent. 7406 len. 20]: They seemed to lean down towards the earth , as I have seen them since in more southern regions .
Parsing [sent. 7407 len. 9]: It was , indeed , a glorious night .
Parsing [sent. 7408 len. 16]: That is , I knew it was ; I did not feel that it was .
Parsing [sent. 7409 len. 27]: For the death which I went to be near , came , with a strange sense of separation , between me and the nature around me .
Parsing [sent. 7410 len. 33]: I felt as if nature knew nothing , felt nothing , meant nothing , did not belong to humanity at all ; for here was death , and there shone the stars .
Parsing [sent. 7411 len. 9]: I was wrong , as I knew afterwards .
Parsing [sent. 7412 len. 13]: I had had very little knowledge of the external shows of death .
Parsing [sent. 7413 len. 21]: Strange as it may appear , I had never yet seen a fellow-creature pass beyond the call of his fellow-mortals .
Parsing [sent. 7414 len. 9]: I had not even seen my father die .
Parsing [sent. 7415 len. 8]: And the thought was oppressive to me .
Parsing [sent. 7416 len. 41]: `` To think , '' I said to myself , as I walked over the bridge to the village-street -- `` to think that the one moment the person is here , and the next -- who shall say WHERE ?
Parsing [sent. 7417 len. 11]: for we know nothing of the region beyond the grave !
Parsing [sent. 7418 len. 34]: Not even our risen Lord thought fit to bring back from Hades any news for the human family standing straining their eyes after their brothers and sisters that have vanished in the dark .
Parsing [sent. 7419 len. 34]: Surely it is well , all well , although we know nothing , save that our Lord has been there , knows all about it , and does not choose to tell us .
Parsing [sent. 7420 len. 4]: Welcome ignorarance then !
Parsing [sent. 7421 len. 10]: the ignorance in which he chooses to leave us .
Parsing [sent. 7422 len. 22]: I would rather not know , if He gave me my choice , but preferred that I should not know . ''
Parsing [sent. 7423 len. 13]: And so the oppression passed from me , and I was free .
Parsing [sent. 7424 len. 44]: But little as I knew of the signs of the approach of death , I was certain , the moment I saw Catherine , that the veil that hid the `` silent land '' had begun to lift slowly between her and it .
Parsing [sent. 7425 len. 29]: And for a moment I almost envied her that she was so soon to see and know that after which our blindness and ignorance were wondering and hungering .
Parsing [sent. 7426 len. 5]: She could hardly speak .
Parsing [sent. 7427 len. 7]: She looked more patient than calm .
Parsing [sent. 7428 len. 40]: There was no light in the room but that of the fire , which flickered flashing and fading , now lighting up the troubled eye , and now letting a shadow of the coming repose fall gently over it .
Parsing [sent. 7429 len. 19]: Thomas sat by the fire with the child on his knee , both looking fixedly into the glow .
Parsing [sent. 7430 len. 20]: Gerard 's natural mood was so quiet and earnest , that the solemnity about him did not oppress him .
Parsing [sent. 7431 len. 38]: He looked as if he were present at some religious observance of which he felt more than he understood , and his childish peace was in no wise inharmonious with the awful silence of the coming change .
Parsing [sent. 7432 len. 15]: He was no more disquieted at the presence of death than the stars were .
Parsing [sent. 7433 len. 29]: And this was the end of the lovely girl -- to leave the fair world still young , because a selfish man had seen that she was fair !
Parsing [sent. 7434 len. 11]: No time can change the relation of cause and effect .
Parsing [sent. 7435 len. 15]: The poison that operates ever so slowly is yet poison , and yet slays .
Parsing [sent. 7436 len. 17]: And that man was now murdering her , with weapon long-reaching from out of the past .
Parsing [sent. 7437 len. 6]: But no , thank God !
Parsing [sent. 7438 len. 8]: this was not the end of her .
Parsing [sent. 7439 len. 21]: Though there is woe for that man by whom the offence cometh , yet there is provision for the offence .
Parsing [sent. 7440 len. 20]: There is One who bringeth light out of darkness , joy out of sorrow , humility out of wrong .
Parsing [sent. 7441 len. 65]: Back to the Father 's house we go with the sorrows and sins which , instead of inheriting the earth , we gathered and heaped upon our weary shoulders , and a different Elder Brother from that angry one who would not receive the poor swine-humbled prodigal , takes the burden from our shoulders , and leads us into the presence of the Good .
Parsing [sent. 7442 len. 36]: She put out her hand feebly , let it lie in mine , looked as if she wanted me to sit down by her bedside , and when I did so , closed her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 7443 len. 4]: She said nothing .
Parsing [sent. 7444 len. 35]: Her father was too much troubled to meet me without showing the signs of his distress , and his was a nature that ever sought concealment for its emotion ; therefore he sat still .
Parsing [sent. 7445 len. 32]: But Gerard crept down from his knee , came to me , clambered up on mine , and laid his little hand upon his mother 's , which I was holding .
Parsing [sent. 7446 len. 24]: She opened her eyes , looked at the child , shut them again , and tears came out from between the closed lids .
Parsing [sent. 7447 len. 8]: `` Has Gerard ever been baptized ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7448 len. 4]: I asked her .
Parsing [sent. 7449 len. 6]: Her lips indicated a NO .
Parsing [sent. 7450 len. 8]: `` Then I will be his godfather .
Parsing [sent. 7451 len. 18]: And that will be a pledge to you that I will never lose sight of him . ''
Parsing [sent. 7452 len. 11]: She pressed my hand , and the tears came faster .
Parsing [sent. 7453 len. 149]: Believing with all my heart that the dying should remember their dying Lord , and that the `` Do this in remembrance of me '' can never be better obeyed than when the partaker is about to pass , supported by the God of his faith , through the same darkness which lay before our Lord when He uttered the words and appointed the symbol , we kneeled , Thomas and I , and young Tom , who had by this time joined us with his sister Mary , around the bed , and partook with the dying woman of the signs of that death , wherein our Lord gave Himself entirely to us , to live by His death , and to the Father of us all in holiest sacrifice as the high-priest of us His people , leading us to the altar of a like self-abnegation .
Parsing [sent. 7454 len. 22]: Upon what that bread and that wine mean , the sacrifice of our Lord , the whole world of humanity hangs .
Parsing [sent. 7455 len. 7]: It is the redemption of men .
Parsing [sent. 7456 len. 14]: After she had received the holy sacrament , she lay still as before .
Parsing [sent. 7457 len. 15]: I heard her murmur once , `` Lord , I do not deserve it .
Parsing [sent. 7458 len. 7]: But I do love Thee . ''
Parsing [sent. 7459 len. 12]: And about two hours after , she quietly breathed her last .
Parsing [sent. 7460 len. 20]: We all kneeled , and I thanked the Father of us aloud that He had taken her to Himself .
Parsing [sent. 7461 len. 22]: Gerard had been fast asleep on his aunt 's lap , and she had put him to bed a little before .
Parsing [sent. 7462 len. 22]: Surely he slept a deeper sleep than his mother 's ; for had she not awaked even as she fell asleep ?
Parsing [sent. 7463 len. 15]: When I came out once more , I knew better what the stars meant .
Parsing [sent. 7464 len. 51]: They looked to me now as if they knew all about death , and therefore could not be sad to the eyes of men ; as if that unsympathetic look they wore came from this , that they were made like the happy truth , and not like our fears .
Parsing [sent. 7465 len. 28]: But soon the solemn feeling of repose , the sense that the world and all its cares would thus pass into nothing , vanished in its turn .
Parsing [sent. 7466 len. 31]: For a moment I had been , as it were , walking on the shore of the Eternal , where the tide of time had left me in its retreat .
Parsing [sent. 7467 len. 26]: Far away across the level sands I heard it moaning , but I stood on the firm ground of truth , and heeded it not .
Parsing [sent. 7468 len. 31]: In a few moments more it was raving around me ; it had carried me away from my rest , and I was filled with the noise of its cares .
Parsing [sent. 7469 len. 26]: For when I returned home , my sister told me that Old Rogers had called , and seemed concerned not to find me at home .
Parsing [sent. 7470 len. 21]: He would have gone to find me , my sister said , had I been anywhere but by a deathbed .
Parsing [sent. 7471 len. 17]: He would not leave any message , however , saying he would call in the morning .
Parsing [sent. 7472 len. 10]: I thought it better to go to his house .
Parsing [sent. 7473 len. 46]: The stars were still shining as brightly as before , but a strong foreboding of trouble filled my mind , and once more the stars were far away , and lifted me no nearer to `` Him who made the seven stars and Orion . ''
Parsing [sent. 7474 len. 102]: When I examined myself , I could give no reason for my sudden fearfulness , save this : that as I went to Catherine 's house , I had passed Jane Rogers on her way to her father 's , and having just greeted her , had gone on ; but , as it now came back upon me , she had looked at me strangely -- that is , with some significance in her face which conveyed nothing to me ; and now her father had been to seek me : it must have something to do with Miss Oldcastle .
Parsing [sent. 7475 len. 29]: But when I came to the cottage , it was dark and still , and I could not bring myself to rouse the weary man from his bed .
Parsing [sent. 7476 len. 18]: Indeed it was past eleven , as I found to my surprise on looking at my watch .
Parsing [sent. 7477 len. 30]: So I turned and lingered by the old mill , and fell a pondering on the profusion of strength that rushed past the wheel away to the great sea .
Parsing [sent. 7478 len. 3]: doing nothing .
Parsing [sent. 7479 len. 18]: `` Nature , '' I thought , `` does not demand that power should always be force .
Parsing [sent. 7480 len. 5]: Power itself must repose .
Parsing [sent. 7481 len. 13]: He that believeth shall -- not make haste , says the Bible .
Parsing [sent. 7482 len. 8]: But it needs strength to be still .
Parsing [sent. 7483 len. 11]: Is my faith not strong enough to be still ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7484 len. 20]: I looked up to the heavens once more , and the quietness of the stars seemed to reproach me .
Parsing [sent. 7485 len. 50]: `` We are safe up here , '' they seemed to say : `` we shine , fearless and confident , for the God who gave the primrose its rough leaves to hide it from the blast of uneven spring , hangs us in the awful hollows of space .
Parsing [sent. 7486 len. 9]: We can not fall out of His safety .
Parsing [sent. 7487 len. 10]: Lift up your eyes on high , and behold !
Parsing [sent. 7488 len. 14]: Who hath created these things -- that bringeth out their host by number !
Parsing [sent. 7489 len. 7]: He calleth them all by names .
Parsing [sent. 7490 len. 19]: By the greatness of His might , for that He is strong in power , not one faileth .
Parsing [sent. 7491 len. 7]: Why sayest thou , O Jacob !
Parsing [sent. 7492 len. 6]: and speakest , O Israel !
Parsing [sent. 7493 len. 19]: my way is hid from the Lord , and my judgment is passed over from my God ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7494 len. 20]: The night was very still ; there was , I thought , no one awake within miles of me .
Parsing [sent. 7495 len. 15]: The stars seemed to shine into me the divine reproach of those glorious words .
Parsing [sent. 7496 len. 6]: `` O my God ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7497 len. 12]: I cried , and fell on my knees by the mill-door .
Parsing [sent. 7498 len. 12]: What I tried to say more I will not say here .
Parsing [sent. 7499 len. 9]: I MAY say that I cried to God .
Parsing [sent. 7500 len. 15]: What I said to Him ought not , can not be repeated to another .
Parsing [sent. 7501 len. 48]: When I opened my eyes I saw the door of the mill was open too , and there in the door , his white head glimmering , stood Old Rogers , with a look on his face as if he had just come down from the mount .
Parsing [sent. 7502 len. 30]: I started to my feet , with that strange feeling of something like shame that seizes one at the very thought of other eyes than those of the Father .
Parsing [sent. 7503 len. 33]: The old man came forward , and bowed his head with an unconscious expression of humble dignity , but would have passed me without speech , leaving the mill-door open behind him .
Parsing [sent. 7504 len. 10]: I could not bear to part with him thus .
Parsing [sent. 7505 len. 11]: `` Wo n't you speak to me , Rogers ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7506 len. 3]: I said .
Parsing [sent. 7507 len. 8]: He turned at once with evident pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 7508 len. 8]: `` I beg your pardon , sir .
Parsing [sent. 7509 len. 19]: I was ashamed of having intruded on you , and I thought you would rather be left alone .
Parsing [sent. 7510 len. 34]: I thought -- I thought -- '' hesitated the old man , `` that you might like to go into the mill , for the night 's cold out o ' doors . ''
Parsing [sent. 7511 len. 6]: `` Thank you , Rogers .
Parsing [sent. 7512 len. 5]: I wo n't now .
Parsing [sent. 7513 len. 8]: I thought you had been in bed .
Parsing [sent. 7514 len. 11]: How do you come to be out so late ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7515 len. 22]: `` You see , sir , when I 'm in any trouble , it 's no use to go to bed .
Parsing [sent. 7516 len. 5]: I ca n't sleep .
Parsing [sent. 7517 len. 10]: I only keep the old ` oman wakin ' .
Parsing [sent. 7518 len. 57]: And the key o ' the mill allus hangin ' at the back o ' my door , and knowin ' it to be a good place to -- to -- shut the door in , I came out as soon as she was asleep ; but I little thought to see you , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 7519 len. 14]: `` I came to find you , not thinking how the time went .
Parsing [sent. 7520 len. 7]: Catherine Weir is gone home . ''
Parsing [sent. 7521 len. 12]: `` I am right glad to hear it , poor woman .
Parsing [sent. 7522 len. 13]: And perhaps something will come out now that will help us . ''
Parsing [sent. 7523 len. 15]: `` I do not quite understand you , '' I said , with hesitation .
Parsing [sent. 7524 len. 6]: But Rogers made no reply .
Parsing [sent. 7525 len. 12]: `` I am sorry to hear you are in trouble to-night .
Parsing [sent. 7526 len. 6]: Can I help you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7527 len. 3]: I resumed .
Parsing [sent. 7528 len. 14]: `` If you can help yourself , sir , you can help me .
Parsing [sent. 7529 len. 9]: But I have no right to say so .
Parsing [sent. 7530 len. 23]: Only , if a pair of old eyes be not blind , a man may pray to God about anything he sees .
Parsing [sent. 7531 len. 29]: I was prayin ' hard about you in there , sir , while you was on your knees o ' the other side o ' the door . ''
Parsing [sent. 7532 len. 20]: I could partly guess what the old man meant , and I could not ask him for further explanation .
Parsing [sent. 7533 len. 11]: `` What did you want to see me about ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7534 len. 3]: I inquired .
Parsing [sent. 7535 len. 6]: He hesitated for a moment .
Parsing [sent. 7536 len. 12]: `` I daresay it was very foolish of me , sir .
Parsing [sent. 7537 len. 29]: But I just wanted to tell you that -- our Jane was down here from the Hall this arternoon -- '' `` I passed her on the bridge .
Parsing [sent. 7538 len. 6]: Is she quite well ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7539 len. 7]: `` Yes , yes , sir .
Parsing [sent. 7540 len. 9]: You know that 's not the point . ''
Parsing [sent. 7541 len. 19]: The old man 's tone seemed to reprove me for vain words , and I held my peace .
Parsing [sent. 7542 len. 8]: `` The captain 's there again . ''
Parsing [sent. 7543 len. 10]: An icy spear seemed to pass through my heart .
Parsing [sent. 7544 len. 6]: I could make no reply .
Parsing [sent. 7545 len. 17]: The same moment a cold wind blew on me from the open door of the mill .
Parsing [sent. 7546 len. 61]: Although Lear was of course right when he said , `` The tempest in my mind Doth from my senses take all feeling else Save what beats there , '' yet it is also true , that sometimes , in the midst of its greatest pain , the mind takes marvellous notice of the smallest things that happen around it .
Parsing [sent. 7547 len. 35]: This involves a law of which illustrations could be plentifully adduced from Shakespeare himself , namely , that the intellectual part of the mind can go on working with strange independence of the emotional .
Parsing [sent. 7548 len. 40]: From the door of the mill , as from a sepulchral tavern , blew a cold wind like the very breath of death upon me , just when that pang shot , in absolute pain , through my heart .
Parsing [sent. 7549 len. 37]: For a wind had arisen from behind the mill , and we were in its shelter save where a window behind and the door beside me allowed free passage to the first of the coming storm .
Parsing [sent. 7550 len. 13]: I believed I turned away from the old man without a word .
Parsing [sent. 7551 len. 8]: He made no attempt to detain me .
Parsing [sent. 7552 len. 52]: Whether he went back into his closet , the old mill , sacred in the eyes of the Father who honours His children , even as the church wherein many prayers went up to Him , or turned homewards to his cottage and his sleeping wife , I can not tell .
Parsing [sent. 7553 len. 63]: The first I remember after that cold wind is , that I was fighting with that wind , gathered even to a storm , upon the common where I had dealt so severely with her who had this very night gone into that region into which , as into a waveless sea , all the rivers of life rush and are silent .
Parsing [sent. 7554 len. 7]: Is it the sea of death ?
Parsing [sent. 7555 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 7556 len. 36]: The sea of life -- a life too keen , too refined , for our senses to know it , and therefore we call it death -- because we can not lay hold upon it .
Parsing [sent. 7557 len. 15]: I will not dwell upon my thoughts as I wandered about over that waste .
Parsing [sent. 7558 len. 41]: The wind had risen to a storm charged with fierce showers of stinging hail , which gave a look of gray wrath to the invisible wind as it swept slanting by , and then danced and scudded along the levels .
Parsing [sent. 7559 len. 22]: The next point in that night of pain is when I found myself standing at the iron gate of Oldcastle Hall .
Parsing [sent. 7560 len. 60]: I had left the common , passed my own house and the church , crossed the river , walked through the village , and was restored to self-consciousness -- that is , I knew that I was there -- only when first I stood in the shelter of one of those great pillars and the monster on its top .
Parsing [sent. 7561 len. 21]: Finding the gate open , for they were not precise about having it fastened , I pushed it and entered .
Parsing [sent. 7562 len. 38]: The wind was roaring in the trees as I think I have never heard it roar since ; for the hail clashed upon the bare branches and twigs , and mingled an unearthly hiss with the roar .
Parsing [sent. 7563 len. 30]: In the midst of it the house stood like a tomb , dark , silent , without one dim light to show that sleep and not death ruled within .
Parsing [sent. 7564 len. 48]: I could have fancied that there were no windows in it , that it stood , like an eyeless skull , in that gaunt forest of skeleton trees , empty and desolate , beaten by the ungenial hail , the dead rain of the country of death .
Parsing [sent. 7565 len. 41]: I passed round to the other side , stepping gently lest some ear might be awake -- as if any ear , even that of Judy 's white wolf , could have heard the loudest step in such a storm .
Parsing [sent. 7566 len. 31]: I heard the hailstones crush between my feet and the soft grass of the lawn , but I dared not stop to look up at the back of the house .
Parsing [sent. 7567 len. 42]: I went on to the staircase in the rock , and by its rude steps , dangerous in the flapping of such storm-wings as swept about it that night , descended to the little grove below , around the deep-walled pool .
Parsing [sent. 7568 len. 8]: Here the wind did not reach me .
Parsing [sent. 7569 len. 38]: It roared overhead , but , save an occasional sigh , as if of sympathy with their suffering brethren abroad in the woild , the hermits of this cell stood upright and still around the sleeping water .
Parsing [sent. 7570 len. 32]: But my heart was a well in which a storm boiled and raged ; and all that `` pother o'er my head '' was peace itself compared to what I felt .
Parsing [sent. 7571 len. 22]: I sat down on the seat at the foot of a tree , where I had first seen Miss Oldcastle reading .
Parsing [sent. 7572 len. 9]: And then I looked up to the house .
Parsing [sent. 7573 len. 8]: Yes , there was a light there !
Parsing [sent. 7574 len. 7]: It must be in her window .
Parsing [sent. 7575 len. 41]: She then could not rest any more than I. Sleep was driven from her eyes because she must wed the man she would not ; while sleep was driven from mine because I could not marry the woman I would .
Parsing [sent. 7576 len. 4]: Was that it ?
Parsing [sent. 7577 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 7578 len. 25]: My heart acquitted me , in part at least , of thinking only of my own sorrow in the presence of her greater distress .
Parsing [sent. 7579 len. 22]: Gladly would I have given her up for ever , without a hope , to redeem her from such a bondage .
Parsing [sent. 7580 len. 17]: `` But it would be to marry another some day , '' suggested the tormentor within .
Parsing [sent. 7581 len. 18]: And then the storm , which had a little abated , broke out afresh in my soul .
Parsing [sent. 7582 len. 39]: But before I rose from her seat I was ready even for that -- at least I thought so -- if only I might deliver her from the all but destruction that seemed to be impending over her .
Parsing [sent. 7583 len. 77]: The same moment in which my mind seemed to have arrived at the possibility of such a resolution , I rose almost involuntarily , and glancing once more at the dull light in her window -- for I did not doubt that it was her window , though it was much too dark to discern , the shape of the house -- almost felt my way to the stair , and climbed again into the storm .
Parsing [sent. 7584 len. 12]: But I was quieter now , and able to go home .
Parsing [sent. 7585 len. 26]: It must have been nearly morning , though at this season of the year the morning is undefined , when I reached my own house .
Parsing [sent. 7586 len. 36]: My sister had gone to bed , for I could always let myself in ; nor , indeed , did any one in Marshmailows think the locking of the door at night an imperative duty .
Parsing [sent. 7587 len. 19]: When I fell asleep , I was again in the old quarry , staring into the deep well .
Parsing [sent. 7588 len. 54]: I thought Mrs Oldcastle was murdering her daughter in the house above , while I was spell-bound to the spot , where , if I stood long enough , I should see her body float into the well from the subterranean passage , the opening of which was just below where I stood .
Parsing [sent. 7589 len. 46]: I was thus confusing and reconstructing the two dreadful stories of the place -- that told me by old Weir , about the circumstances of his birth ; and that told me by Dr Duncan , about Mrs Oldcastle 's treatment of her elder daughter .
Parsing [sent. 7590 len. 49]: But as a white hand and arm appeared in the water below me , sorrow and pity more than horror broke the bonds of sleep , and I awoke to less trouble than that of my dreams , only because that which I feared had not yet come .
Parsing [sent. 7591 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXX .
Parsing [sent. 7592 len. 5]: A SERMON TO MYSELF .
Parsing [sent. 7593 len. 6]: It was the Sabbath morn .
Parsing [sent. 7594 len. 5]: But such a Sabbath !
Parsing [sent. 7595 len. 13]: The day seemed all wan with weeping , and gray with care .
Parsing [sent. 7596 len. 14]: The wind dashed itself against the casement , laden with soft heavy sleet .
Parsing [sent. 7597 len. 15]: The ground , the bushes , the very outhouses seemed sodden with the rain .
Parsing [sent. 7598 len. 41]: The trees , which looked stricken as if they could die of grief , were yet tormented with fear , for the bare branches went streaming out in the torrent of the wind , as cowering before the invisible foe .
Parsing [sent. 7599 len. 15]: The first thing I knew when I awoke was the raving of that wind .
Parsing [sent. 7600 len. 10]: I could lie in bed not a moment longer .
Parsing [sent. 7601 len. 5]: I could not rest .
Parsing [sent. 7602 len. 12]: But how was I to do the work of my office ?
Parsing [sent. 7603 len. 47]: When a man 's duty looks like an enemy , dragging him into the dark mountains , he has no less to go with it than when , like a friend with loving face , it offers to lead him along green pastures by the river-side .
Parsing [sent. 7604 len. 36]: I had little power over my feelings ; I could not prevent my mind from mirroring itself in the nature around me ; but I could address myself to the work I had to do .
Parsing [sent. 7605 len. 5]: `` My God ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7606 len. 18]: was all the prayer I could pray ere I descended to join my sister at the breakfast-table .
Parsing [sent. 7607 len. 10]: But He knew what lay behind the one word .
Parsing [sent. 7608 len. 11]: Martha could not help seeing that something was the matter .
Parsing [sent. 7609 len. 14]: I saw by her looks that she could read so much in mine .
Parsing [sent. 7610 len. 21]: But her eyes alone questioned me , and that only by glancing at me anxiously from , time to time .
Parsing [sent. 7611 len. 9]: I was grateful to her for saying nothing .
Parsing [sent. 7612 len. 14]: It is a fine thing in friendship to know when to be silent .
Parsing [sent. 7613 len. 56]: The prayers were before me , in the hands of all my friends , and in the hearts of some of them ; and if I could not enter into them as I would , I could yet read them humbly before God as His servant to help the people to worship as one flock .
Parsing [sent. 7614 len. 7]: But how was I to preach ?
Parsing [sent. 7615 len. 14]: I had been in difficulty before now , but never in so much .
Parsing [sent. 7616 len. 13]: How was I to teach others , whose mind was one confusion ?
Parsing [sent. 7617 len. 50]: The subject on which I was pondering when young Weir came to tell me his sister was dying , had retreated as if into the far past ; it seemed as if years had come between that time and this , though but one black night had rolled by .
Parsing [sent. 7618 len. 22]: To attempt to speak upon that would have been vain , for I had nothing to say on the matter now .
Parsing [sent. 7619 len. 38]: And if I could have recalled my former thoughts , I should have felt a hypocrite as I delivered them , so utterly dissociated would they have been from anything that I was thinking or feeling now .
Parsing [sent. 7620 len. 91]: Here would have been my visible form and audible voice , uttering that as present to me now , as felt by me now , which I did think and feel yesterday , but which , although I believed it , was not present to my feeling or heart , and must wait the revolution of months , or it might be of years , before I should feel it again , before I should be able to exhort my people about it with the fervour of a present faith .
Parsing [sent. 7621 len. 16]: But , indeed , I could not even recall what I had thought and felt .
Parsing [sent. 7622 len. 15]: Should I then tell them that I could not speak to them that morning ?
Parsing [sent. 7623 len. 9]: -- There would be nothing wrong in that .
Parsing [sent. 7624 len. 26]: But I felt ashamed of yielding to personal trouble when the truths of God were all about me , although I could not feel them .
Parsing [sent. 7625 len. 18]: Might not some hungry soul go away without being satisfied , because I was faint and down-hearted ?
Parsing [sent. 7626 len. 45]: I confess I had a desire likewise to avoid giving rise to speculation and talk about myself , a desire which , although not wrong , could neither have strengthened me to speak the truth , nor have justified me in making the attempt .
Parsing [sent. 7627 len. 7]: -- What was to be done ?
Parsing [sent. 7628 len. 35]: All at once the remembrance crossed my mind of a sermon I had preached before upon the words of St Paul : `` Thou therefore which teachest another , teachest thou not thyself ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7629 len. 50]: a subject suggested by the fact that on the preceding Sunday I had especially felt , in preaching to my people , that I was exhorting myself whose necessity was greater than theirs -- at least I felt it to be greater than I could know theirs to be .
Parsing [sent. 7630 len. 32]: And now the converse of the thought came to me , and I said to myself , `` Might I not try the other way now , and preach to myself ?
Parsing [sent. 7631 len. 10]: In teaching myself , might I not teach others ?
Parsing [sent. 7632 len. 5]: Would it not hold ?
Parsing [sent. 7633 len. 8]: I am very troubled and faithless now .
Parsing [sent. 7634 len. 37]: If I knew that God was going to lay the full weight of this grief upon me , yet if I loved Him with all my heart , should I not at least be more quiet ?
Parsing [sent. 7635 len. 31]: There would not be a storm within me then , as if the Father had descended from the throne of the heavens , and ` chaos were come again . '
Parsing [sent. 7636 len. 26]: Let me expostulate with myself in my heart , and the words of my expostulation will not be the less true with my people . ''
Parsing [sent. 7637 len. 25]: All this passed through my mind as I sat in my study after breakfast , with the great old cedar roaring before my window .
Parsing [sent. 7638 len. 8]: It was within an hour of church-time .
Parsing [sent. 7639 len. 34]: I took my Bible , read and thought , got even some comfort already , and found myself in my vestry not quite unwilling to read the prayers and speak to my people .
Parsing [sent. 7640 len. 6]: There were very few present .
Parsing [sent. 7641 len. 31]: The day was one of the worst -- violently stormy , which harmonized somewhat with my feelings ; and , to my further relief , the Hall pew was empty .
Parsing [sent. 7642 len. 37]: Instead of finding myself a mere minister to the prayers of others , I found , as I read , that my heart went out in crying to God for the divine presence of His Spirit .
Parsing [sent. 7643 len. 29]: And if I thought more of myself in my prayers than was well , yet as soon as I was converted , would I not strengthen my brethren ?
Parsing [sent. 7644 len. 35]: And the sermon I preached to myself and through myself to my people , was that which the stars had preached to me , and thereby driven me to my knees by the mill-door .
Parsing [sent. 7645 len. 35]: I took for my text , `` The glory of the Lord shall be revealed ; '' and then I proceeded to show them how the glory of the Lord was to be revealed .
Parsing [sent. 7646 len. 102]: I preached to myself that throughout this fortieth chapter of the prophecies of Isaiah , the power of God is put side by side with the weakness of men , not that He , the perfect , may glory over His feeble children ; not that He may say to them -- `` Look how mighty I am , and go down upon your knees and worship '' -- for power alone was never yet worthy of prayer ; but that he may say thus : `` Look , my children , you will never be strong but with MY strength .
Parsing [sent. 7647 len. 8]: I have no other to give you .
Parsing [sent. 7648 len. 11]: And that you can get only by trusting in me .
Parsing [sent. 7649 len. 10]: I can not give it you any other way .
Parsing [sent. 7650 len. 6]: There is no other way .
Parsing [sent. 7651 len. 8]: But can you not trust in me ?
Parsing [sent. 7652 len. 6]: Look how strong I am .
Parsing [sent. 7653 len. 6]: You wither like the grass .
Parsing [sent. 7654 len. 4]: Do not fear .
Parsing [sent. 7655 len. 5]: Let the grass wither .
Parsing [sent. 7656 len. 36]: Lay hold of my word , that which I say to you out of my truth , and that will be life in you that the blowing of the wind that withers can not reach .
Parsing [sent. 7657 len. 16]: I am coming with my strong hand and my judging arm to do my work .
Parsing [sent. 7658 len. 13]: And what is the work of my strong hand and ruling arm ?
Parsing [sent. 7659 len. 32]: To feed my flock like a shepherd , to gather the lambs with my arm , and carry them in my bosom , and gently lead those that are with young .
Parsing [sent. 7660 len. 52]: I have measured the waters in the hollow of my hand , and held the mountains in my scales , to give each his due weight , and all the nations , so strong and fearful in your eyes , are as nothing beside my strength and what I can do .
Parsing [sent. 7661 len. 35]: Do not think of me as of an image that your hands can make , a thing you can choose to serve , and for which you can do things to win its favour .
Parsing [sent. 7662 len. 23]: I am before and above the earth , and over your life , and your oppressors I will wither with my breath .
Parsing [sent. 7663 len. 13]: I come to you with help I need no worship from you .
Parsing [sent. 7664 len. 16]: But I say love me , for love is life , and I love you .
Parsing [sent. 7665 len. 8]: Look at the stars I have made .
Parsing [sent. 7666 len. 7]: I know every one of them .
Parsing [sent. 7667 len. 11]: Not one goes wrong , because I keep him right .
Parsing [sent. 7668 len. 31]: Why sayest thou , O Jacob , and speakest , O Israel -- my way is HID from the Lord , and my judgment is passed over from my God !
Parsing [sent. 7669 len. 20]: I give POWER to the FAINT , and to them that have no might , plenty of strength . ''
Parsing [sent. 7670 len. 24]: `` Thus , '' I went on to say , `` God brings His strength to destroy our weakness by making us strong .
Parsing [sent. 7671 len. 6]: This is a God indeed !
Parsing [sent. 7672 len. 7]: Shall we not trust Him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7673 len. 54]: I gave my people this paraphrase of the chapter , to help them to see the meanings which their familiarity with the words , and their non-familiarity with the modes of Eastern thought , and the forms of Eastern expression , would unite to prevent them from catching more than broken glimmerings of .
Parsing [sent. 7674 len. 113]: And then I tried to show them that it was in the commonest troubles of life , as well as in the spiritual fears and perplexities that came upon them , that they were to trust in God ; for God made the outside as well as the inside , and they altogether belonged to Him ; and that when outside things , such as pain or loss of work , or difficulty in getting money , were referred to God and His will , they too straightway became spiritual affairs , for nothing in the world could any longer appear common or unclean to the man who saw God in everything .
Parsing [sent. 7675 len. 93]: But I told them they must not be too anxious to be delivered from that which troubled them : but they ought to be anxious to have the presence of God with them to support them , and make them able in patience to possess their souls ; and so the trouble would work its end -- the purification of their minds , that the light and gladness of God and all His earth , which the pure in heart and the meek alone could inherit , might shine in upon them .
Parsing [sent. 7676 len. 43]: And then I repeated to them this portion of a prayer out of one of Sir Philip Sidney 's books : -- `` O Lord , I yield unto Thy will , and joyfully embrace what sorrow Thou wilt have me suffer .
Parsing [sent. 7677 len. 91]: Only thus much let me crave of Thee , -LRB- let my craving , O Lord , be accepted of Thee , since even that proceeds from Thee , -RRB- let me crave , even by the noblest title , which in my greatest affliction I may give myself , that I am Thy creature , and by Thy goodness -LRB- which is Thyself -RRB- that Thou wilt suffer some beam of Thy majesty so to shine into my mind , that it may still depend confidently on Thee . ''
Parsing [sent. 7678 len. 31]: All the time I was speaking , the rain , mingled with sleet , was dashing against the windows , and the wind was howling over the graves all about .
Parsing [sent. 7679 len. 60]: But the dead were not troubled by the storm ; and over my head , from beam to beam of the roof , now resting on one , now flitting to another , a sparrow kept flying , which had taken refuge in the church till the storm should cease and the sun shine out in the great temple .
Parsing [sent. 7680 len. 65]: `` This , '' I said aloud , `` is what the church is for : as the sparrow finds there a house from the storm , so the human heart escapes thither to hear the still small voice of God when its faith is too weak to find Him in the storm , and in the sorrow , and in the pain . ''
Parsing [sent. 7681 len. 25]: And while I spoke , a dim watery gleam fell on the chancel-floor , and the comfort of the sun awoke in my heart .
Parsing [sent. 7682 len. 63]: Nor let any one call me superstitious for taking that pale sun-ray of hope as sent to me ; for I received it as comfort for the race , and for me as one of the family , even as the bow that was set in the cloud , a promise to the eyes of light for them that sit in darkness .
Parsing [sent. 7683 len. 43]: As I write , my eye falls upon the Bible on the table by my side , and I read the words , `` For the Lord God is a sun and shield , the Lord will give grace and glory . ''
Parsing [sent. 7684 len. 24]: And I lift my eyes from my paper and look abroad from my window , and the sun is shining in its strength .
Parsing [sent. 7685 len. 41]: The leaves are dancing in the light wind that gives them each its share of the sun , and my trouble has passed away for ever , like the storm of that night and the unrest of that strange Sabbath .
Parsing [sent. 7686 len. 75]: Such comforts would come to us oftener from Nature , if we really believed that our God was the God of Nature ; that when He made , or rather when He makes , He means ; that not His hands only , but His heart too , is in the making of those things ; that , therefore , the influences of Nature upon human minds and hearts are because He intended them .
Parsing [sent. 7687 len. 27]: And if we believe that our God is everywhere , why should we not think Him present even in the coincidences that sometimes seem so strange ?
Parsing [sent. 7688 len. 21]: For , if He be in the things that coincide , He must be in the coincidence of those things .
Parsing [sent. 7689 len. 35]: Miss Oldcastle told me once that she could not take her eyes off a butterfly which was flitting about in the church all the time I was speaking of the resurrection of the dead .
Parsing [sent. 7690 len. 114]: I told the people that in Greek there was one word for the soul and for a butterfly -- Psyche ; that I thought as the light on the rain made the natural symbol of mercy -- the rainbow , so the butterfly was the type in nature , and made to the end , amongst other ends , of being such a type -- of the resurrection of the human body ; that its name certainly expressed the hope of the Greeks in immortality , while to us it speaks likewise of a glorified body , whereby we shall know and love each other with our eyes as well as our hearts .
Parsing [sent. 7691 len. 37]: -- My sister saw the butterfly too , but only remembered that she had seen it when it was mentioned in her hearing : on her the sight made no impression ; she saw no coincidence .
Parsing [sent. 7692 len. 15]: I descended from the pulpit comforted by the sermon I had preached to myself .
Parsing [sent. 7693 len. 66]: But I was glad to feel justified in telling my people that , in consequence of the continued storm , for there had been no more of sunshine than just that watery gleam , there would be no service in the afternoon , and that I would instead visit some of my sick poor , whom the weather might have discomposed in their worn dwellings .
Parsing [sent. 7694 len. 8]: The people were very slow in dispersing .
Parsing [sent. 7695 len. 59]: There was so much putting on of clogs , gathering up of skirts over the head , and expanding of umbrellas , soon to be taken down again as worse than useless in the violence of the wind , that the porches were crowded , and the few left in the church detained till the others made way .
Parsing [sent. 7696 len. 5]: I lingered with these .
Parsing [sent. 7697 len. 6]: They were all poor people .
Parsing [sent. 7698 len. 63]: `` I am sorry you will have such a wet walk home , '' I said to Mrs Baird , the wife of old Reginald Baird , the shoemaker , a little wizened creature , with more wrinkles than hairs , who the older and more withered she grew , seemed like the kernels of some nuts only to grow the sweeter .
Parsing [sent. 7699 len. 16]: `` It 's very good of you to let us off this afternoon , sir .
Parsing [sent. 7700 len. 26]: Not as I minds the wet : it finds out the holes in people 's shoes , and gets my husband into more work . ''
Parsing [sent. 7701 len. 15]: This was in fact the response of the shoemaker 's wife to my sermon .
Parsing [sent. 7702 len. 22]: If we look for responses after our fashion instead of after people 's own fashion , we ought to be disappointed .
Parsing [sent. 7703 len. 40]: Any recognition of truth , whatever form it may take , whether that of poetic delight , intellectual corroboration , practical commonplace ; or even vulgar aphorism , must be welcomed by the husbandmen of the God of growth .
Parsing [sent. 7704 len. 23]: A response which jars against the peculiar pitch of our mental instrument , must not therefore be turned away from with dislike .
Parsing [sent. 7705 len. 18]: Our mood of the moment is not that by which the universe is tuned into its harmonies .
Parsing [sent. 7706 len. 61]: We must drop our instrument and listen to the other , and if we find that the player upon it is breathing after a higher expression , is , after his fashion , striving to embody something he sees of the same truth the utterance of which called forth this his answer , let us thank God and take courage .
Parsing [sent. 7707 len. 46]: God at least is pleased : and if our refinement and education take away from our pleasure , it is because of something low , false , and selfish , not divine in a word , that is mingled with that refinement and that education .
Parsing [sent. 7708 len. 82]: If the shoemaker 's wife 's response to the prophet 's grand poem about the care of God over His creatures , took the form of acknowledgment for the rain that found out the holes in the people 's shoes , it was the more genuine and true , for in itself it afforded proof that it was not a mere reflex of the words of the prophet , but sprung from the experience and recognition of the shoemaker 's wife .
Parsing [sent. 7709 len. 28]: Nor was there anything necessarily selfish in it , for if there are holes in people 's shoes , the sooner they are found out the better .
Parsing [sent. 7710 len. 39]: While I was talking to Mrs Baird , Mr Stoddart , whose love for the old organ had been stronger than his dislike to the storm , had come down into the church , and now approached me .
Parsing [sent. 7711 len. 26]: `` I never saw you in the church before , Mr Stoddart , '' I said , `` though I have heard you often enough .
Parsing [sent. 7712 len. 9]: You use your own private door always . ''
Parsing [sent. 7713 len. 46]: `` I thought to go that way now , but there came such a fierce burst of wind and rain in my face , that my courage failed me , and I turned back -- like the sparrow -- for refuge in the church . ''
Parsing [sent. 7714 len. 10]: `` A thought strikes me , '' I said .
Parsing [sent. 7715 len. 25]: `` Come home with me , and have some lunch , and then we will go together to see some of my poor people .
Parsing [sent. 7716 len. 9]: I have often wished to ask you . ''
Parsing [sent. 7717 len. 4]: His face fell .
Parsing [sent. 7718 len. 8]: `` It is such a day ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7719 len. 10]: he answered , remonstratingly , but not positively refusing .
Parsing [sent. 7720 len. 11]: It was not his way ever to refuse anything positively .
Parsing [sent. 7721 len. 44]: `` So it was when you set out this morning , '' I returned ; `` but you would not deprive us of the aid of your music for the sake of a charge of wind , and a rattle of rain-drops . ''
Parsing [sent. 7722 len. 10]: `` But I sha n't be of any use .
Parsing [sent. 7723 len. 10]: You are going , and that is enough . ''
Parsing [sent. 7724 len. 6]: `` I beg your pardon .
Parsing [sent. 7725 len. 8]: Your very presence will be of use .
Parsing [sent. 7726 len. 34]: Nothing yet given him or done for him by his fellow , ever did any man so much good as the recognition of the brotherhood by the common signs of friendship and sympathy .
Parsing [sent. 7727 len. 22]: The best good of given money depends on the degree to which it is the sign of that friendship and sympathy .
Parsing [sent. 7728 len. 20]: Our Lord did not make little of visiting : ' I was sick , and ye visited me . '
Parsing [sent. 7729 len. 23]: ` Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these , ye did it not to me . '
Parsing [sent. 7730 len. 62]: Of course , if the visitor goes professionally and not humanly , -- as a mere religious policeman , that is -- whether he only distributes tracts with condescending words , or gives money liberally because he thinks he ought , the more he does not go the better , for he only does harm to them and himself too . ''
Parsing [sent. 7731 len. 23]: `` But I can not pretend to feel any of the interest you consider essential : why then should I go ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7732 len. 8]: `` To please me , your friend .
Parsing [sent. 7733 len. 7]: That is a good human reason .
Parsing [sent. 7734 len. 13]: You need not say a word -- you must not pretend anything .
Parsing [sent. 7735 len. 10]: Go as my companion , not as their visitor .
Parsing [sent. 7736 len. 5]: Will you come ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7737 len. 7]: `` I suppose I must . ''
Parsing [sent. 7738 len. 6]: `` You must , then .
Parsing [sent. 7739 len. 3]: Thank you .
Parsing [sent. 7740 len. 5]: You will help me .
Parsing [sent. 7741 len. 7]: I have seldom a companion . ''
Parsing [sent. 7742 len. 84]: So when the storm-fit had abated for the moment , we hurried to the vicarage , had a good though hasty lunch , -LRB- to which I was pleased to see Mr Stoddart do justice ; for it is with man as with beast , if you want work out of him , he must eat well -- and it is the one justification of eating well , that a man works well upon it , -RRB- and set out for the village .
Parsing [sent. 7743 len. 7]: The rain was worse than ever .
Parsing [sent. 7744 len. 63]: There was no sleet , and the wind was not cold , but the windows of heaven were opened , and if the fountains of the great deep were not broken up , it looked like it , at least , when we reached the bridge and saw how the river had spread out over all the low lands on its borders .
Parsing [sent. 7745 len. 10]: We could not talk much as we went along .
Parsing [sent. 7746 len. 13]: `` Do n't you find some pleasure in fighting the wind ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7747 len. 3]: I said .
Parsing [sent. 7748 len. 53]: `` I have no doubt I should , '' answered Mr Stoddart , `` if I thought I were going to do any good ; but as it is , to tell the truth , I would rather be by my own fire with my folio Dante on the reading desk . ''
Parsing [sent. 7749 len. 27]: `` Well , I would rather help the poorest woman in creation , than contemplate the sufferings of the greatest and wickedest , '' I said .
Parsing [sent. 7750 len. 13]: `` There are two things you forget , '' returned Mr Stoddart .
Parsing [sent. 7751 len. 71]: `` First , that the poem of Dante is not nearly occupied with the sufferings of the wicked ; and next , that what I have complained of in this expedition -- which as far as I am concerned , I would call a wild goose chase , were it not that it is your doing and not mine -- is that I am not going to help anybody . ''
Parsing [sent. 7752 len. 27]: `` You would have the best of the argument entirely , '' I replied , `` if your expectation was sure to turn out correct . ''
Parsing [sent. 7753 len. 39]: As I spoke , we had come within a few yards of the Tomkins 's cottage , which lay low down from the village towards the river , and I saw that the water was at the threshold .
Parsing [sent. 7754 len. 21]: I turned to Mr Stoddart , who , to do him justice , had not yet grumbled in the least .
Parsing [sent. 7755 len. 29]: `` Perhaps you had better go home , after all , '' I said ; `` for you must wade into Tomkins 's if you go at all .
Parsing [sent. 7756 len. 4]: Poor old man !
Parsing [sent. 7757 len. 19]: what can he be doing , with his wife dying , and the river in his house ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7758 len. 12]: `` You have constituted yourself my superior officer , Mr Walton .
Parsing [sent. 7759 len. 10]: I never turned my back on my leader yet .
Parsing [sent. 7760 len. 15]: Though I confess I wish I could see the enemy a little clearer . ''
Parsing [sent. 7761 len. 20]: `` There is the enemy , '' I said , pointing to the water , and walking into it .
Parsing [sent. 7762 len. 10]: Mr Stoddart followed me without a moment 's hesitation .
Parsing [sent. 7763 len. 35]: When I opened the door , the first thing I saw was a small stream of water running straight from the door to the fire on the hearth , which it had already drowned .
Parsing [sent. 7764 len. 11]: The old man was sitting by his wife 's bedside .
Parsing [sent. 7765 len. 9]: Life seemed rapidly going from the old woman .
Parsing [sent. 7766 len. 6]: She lay breathing very hard .
Parsing [sent. 7767 len. 26]: `` Oh , sir , '' said the old man , as he rose , almost crying , `` you 're come at last ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7768 len. 8]: `` Did you send for me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7769 len. 3]: I asked .
Parsing [sent. 7770 len. 5]: `` No , sir .
Parsing [sent. 7771 len. 6]: I had nobody to send .
Parsing [sent. 7772 len. 13]: Leastways , I asked the Lord if He would n't fetch you .
Parsing [sent. 7773 len. 12]: I been prayin ' hard for you for the last hour .
Parsing [sent. 7774 len. 10]: I could n't leave her to come for you .
Parsing [sent. 7775 len. 19]: And I do believe the wind ` ud ha ' blown me off my two old legs . ''
Parsing [sent. 7776 len. 10]: `` Well , I am come , you see .
Parsing [sent. 7777 len. 17]: I would have come sooner , but I had no idea you would be flooded . ''
Parsing [sent. 7778 len. 20]: `` It 's not that I mind , sir , though it IS cold sin ' the fire went .
Parsing [sent. 7779 len. 9]: But she IS goin ' now , sir .
Parsing [sent. 7780 len. 21]: She ha 'n' t spoken a word this two hours and more , and her breathin 's worse and worse .
Parsing [sent. 7781 len. 10]: She do n't know me now , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 7782 len. 10]: A moan of protestation came from the dying woman .
Parsing [sent. 7783 len. 17]: `` She does know you , and loves you too , Tomkins , '' I said .
Parsing [sent. 7784 len. 14]: `` And you 'll both know each other better by and by . ''
Parsing [sent. 7785 len. 11]: The old woman made a feeble motion with her hand .
Parsing [sent. 7786 len. 6]: I took it in mine .
Parsing [sent. 7787 len. 6]: It was cold and deathlike .
Parsing [sent. 7788 len. 15]: The rain was falling in large slow drops from the roof upon the bedclothes .
Parsing [sent. 7789 len. 22]: But she would be beyond the reach of all the region storms before long , and it did not matter much .
Parsing [sent. 7790 len. 27]: `` Look if you can find a basin or plate , Mr Stoddart , and put it to catch the drop here , '' I said .
Parsing [sent. 7791 len. 13]: For I wanted to give him the first chance of being useful .
Parsing [sent. 7792 len. 18]: `` There 's one in the press there , '' said the old man , rising feebly .
Parsing [sent. 7793 len. 10]: `` Keep your seat , '' said Mr Stoddart .
Parsing [sent. 7794 len. 7]: `` I 'll get it . ''
Parsing [sent. 7795 len. 20]: And he got a basin from the cupboard , and put it on the bed to catch the drop .
Parsing [sent. 7796 len. 66]: The old woman held my hand in hers ; but by its motion I knew that she wanted something ; and guessing what it was from what she had said before , I made her husband sit on the bed on the other side of her and take hold of her other hand , while I took his place on the chair by the bedside .
Parsing [sent. 7797 len. 6]: This seemed to content her .
Parsing [sent. 7798 len. 33]: So I went and whispered to Mr Stoddart , who had stood looking on disconsolately : -- `` You heard me say I would visit some of my sick people this afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 7799 len. 8]: Some will be expecting me with certainty .
Parsing [sent. 7800 len. 31]: You must go instead of me , and tell them that I can not come , because old Mrs Tomkins is dying ; but I will see them soon . ''
Parsing [sent. 7801 len. 8]: He seemed rather relieved at the commission .
Parsing [sent. 7802 len. 16]: I gave him the necessary directions to find the cottages , and he left me .
Parsing [sent. 7803 len. 63]: I may mention here that this was the beginning of a relation between Mr Stoddart and the poor of the parish -- a very slight one indeed , at first , for it consisted only in his knowing two or three of them , so as to ask after their health when he met them , and give them an occasional half-crown .
Parsing [sent. 7804 len. 12]: But it led to better things before many years had passed .
Parsing [sent. 7805 len. 54]: It seems scarcely more than yesterday -- though it is twenty years ago -- that I came upon him in the avenue , standing in dismay over the fragments of a jug of soup which he had dropped , to the detriment of his trousers as well as the loss of his soup .
Parsing [sent. 7806 len. 8]: `` What am I to do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7807 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 7808 len. 9]: `` Poor Jones expects his soup to-day . ''
Parsing [sent. 7809 len. 12]: -- `` Why , go back and get some more . ''
Parsing [sent. 7810 len. 9]: -- `` But what will cook say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7811 len. 20]: The poor man was more afraid of the cook than he would have been of a squadron of cavalry .
Parsing [sent. 7812 len. 6]: `` Never mind the cook .
Parsing [sent. 7813 len. 17]: Tell her you must have some more as soon as it can be got ready . ''
Parsing [sent. 7814 len. 7]: He stood uncertain for a moment .
Parsing [sent. 7815 len. 5]: Then his face brightened .
Parsing [sent. 7816 len. 10]: `` I will tell her I want my luncheon .
Parsing [sent. 7817 len. 5]: I always have soup .
Parsing [sent. 7818 len. 16]: And I 'll get out through the greenhouse , and carry it to Jones . ''
Parsing [sent. 7819 len. 16]: -- `` Very well , '' I said ; `` that will do capitally . ''
Parsing [sent. 7820 len. 33]: And I went on , without caring to disturb my satisfaction by determining whether the devotion of his own soup arose more from love to Jones , or fear of the cook .
Parsing [sent. 7821 len. 30]: He was a great help to me in the latter part of his life , especially after I lost good Dr Duncan , and my beloved friend Old Rogers .
Parsing [sent. 7822 len. 20]: He was just one of those men who make excellent front-rank men , but are quite unfit for officers .
Parsing [sent. 7823 len. 18]: He could do what he was told without flinching , but he always required to be told .
Parsing [sent. 7824 len. 16]: I resumed my seat by the bedside , where the old woman was again moaning .
Parsing [sent. 7825 len. 21]: As soon as I took her hand she ceased , and so I sat till it began to grow dark .
Parsing [sent. 7826 len. 8]: `` Are you there , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7827 len. 4]: she would murmur .
Parsing [sent. 7828 len. 7]: `` Yes , I am here .
Parsing [sent. 7829 len. 9]: I have a hold of your hand . ''
Parsing [sent. 7830 len. 10]: `` I ca n't feel you , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 7831 len. 7]: `` But you can hear me .
Parsing [sent. 7832 len. 11]: And you can hear God 's voice in your heart .
Parsing [sent. 7833 len. 11]: I am here , though you ca n't feel me .
Parsing [sent. 7834 len. 13]: And God is here , though you ca n't see Him . ''
Parsing [sent. 7835 len. 21]: She would be silent for a while , and then murmur again -- `` Are you there , Tomkins ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7836 len. 43]: `` Yes , my woman , I 'm here , '' answered the old man to one of these questions ; `` but I wish I was there instead , wheresomever it be as you 're goin ' , old girl . ''
Parsing [sent. 7837 len. 19]: And all that I could hear of her answer was , `` Bym by ; bym by . ''
Parsing [sent. 7838 len. 21]: Why should I linger over the death-bed of an illiterate woman , old and plain , dying away by inches ?
Parsing [sent. 7839 len. 23]: Is it only that she died with a hold of my hand , and that therefore I am interested in the story ?
Parsing [sent. 7840 len. 4]: I trust not .
Parsing [sent. 7841 len. 6]: I was interested in HER .
Parsing [sent. 7842 len. 2]: Why ?
Parsing [sent. 7843 len. 47]: Would my readers be more interested if I told them of the death of a young lovely creature , who said touching things , and died amidst a circle of friends , who felt that the very light of life was being taken away from them ?
Parsing [sent. 7844 len. 66]: It was enough for me that here was a woman with a heart like my own ; who needed the same salvation I needed ; to whom the love of God was the one blessed thing ; who was passing through the same dark passage into the light that the Lord had passed through before her , that I had to pass through after her .
Parsing [sent. 7845 len. 112]: She had no theories -- at least , she gave utterance to none ; she had few thoughts of her own -- and gave still fewer of them expression ; you might guess at a true notion in her mind , but an abstract idea she could scarcely lay hold of ; her speech was very common ; her manner rather brusque than gentle ; but she could love ; she could forget herself ; she could be sorry for what she did or thought wrong ; she could hope ; she could wish to be better ; she could admire good people ; she could trust in God her Saviour .
Parsing [sent. 7846 len. 24]: And now the loving God-made human heart in her was going into a new school that it might begin a fresh beautiful growth .
Parsing [sent. 7847 len. 59]: She was old , I have said , and plain ; but now her old age and plainness were about to vanish , and all that had made her youth attractive to young Tomkins was about to return to her , only rendered tenfold more beautiful by the growth of fifty years of learning according to her ability .
Parsing [sent. 7848 len. 12]: God has such patience in working us into vessels of honour !
Parsing [sent. 7849 len. 7]: in teaching us to be children !
Parsing [sent. 7850 len. 90]: And shall we find the human heart in which the germs of all that is noblest and loveliest and likest to God have begun to grow and manifest themselves uninteresting , because its circumstances have been narrow , bare , and poverty-stricken , though neither sordid nor unclean ; because the woman is old and wrinkled and brown , as if these were more than the transient accidents of humanity ; because she has neither learned grammar nor philosophy ; because her habits have neither been delicate nor self-indulgent ?
Parsing [sent. 7851 len. 67]: To help the mind of such a woman to unfold to the recognition of the endless delights of truth ; to watch the dawn of the rising intelligence upon the too still face , and the transfiguration of the whole form , as the gentle rusticity vanishes in yet gentler grace , is a labour and a delight worth the time and mind of an archangel .
Parsing [sent. 7852 len. 14]: Our best living poet says -- but no ; I will not quote .
Parsing [sent. 7853 len. 33]: It is a distinct wrong that befalls the best books to have many of their best words quoted till in their own place and connexion they cease to have force and influence .
Parsing [sent. 7854 len. 23]: The meaning of the passage is that the communication of truth is one of the greatest delights the human heart can experience .
Parsing [sent. 7855 len. 5]: Surely this is true .
Parsing [sent. 7856 len. 15]: Does not the teaching of men form a great part of the divine gladness ?
Parsing [sent. 7857 len. 78]: Therefore even the dull approaches of death are full of deep significance and warm interest to one who loves his fellows , who desires not to be distinguished by any better fate than theirs ; and shrinks from the pride of supposing that his own death , or that of the noblest of the good , is more precious in the sight of God than that of `` one of the least of these little ones . ''
Parsing [sent. 7858 len. 20]: At length , after a long silence , the peculiar sounds of obstructed breathing indicated the end at hand .
Parsing [sent. 7859 len. 10]: The jaw fell , and the eyes were fixed .
Parsing [sent. 7860 len. 34]: The old man closed the mouth and the eyes of his old companion , weeping like a child , and I prayed aloud , giving thanks to God for taking her to Himself .
Parsing [sent. 7861 len. 43]: It went to my heart to leave the old man alone with the dead ; but it was better to let him be alone for a while , ere the women should come to do the last offices for the abandoned form .
Parsing [sent. 7862 len. 27]: I went to Old Rogers , told him the state in which I had left poor Tomkins , and asked him what was to be done .
Parsing [sent. 7863 len. 13]: `` I 'll go and bring him home , sir , directly .
Parsing [sent. 7864 len. 8]: He ca n't be left there . ''
Parsing [sent. 7865 len. 13]: `` But how can you bring him in such a night ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7866 len. 7]: `` Let me see , sir .
Parsing [sent. 7867 len. 4]: I must think .
Parsing [sent. 7868 len. 13]: Would your mare go in a cart , do you think ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7869 len. 4]: `` Quite quietly .
Parsing [sent. 7870 len. 14]: She brought a load of gravel from the common a few days ago .
Parsing [sent. 7871 len. 6]: But where 's your cart ?
Parsing [sent. 7872 len. 7]: I have n't got one . ''
Parsing [sent. 7873 len. 13]: `` There 's one at Weir 's to be repaired , sir .
Parsing [sent. 7874 len. 10]: It would n't be stealing to borrow it . ''
Parsing [sent. 7875 len. 10]: How he managed with Tomkins I do not know .
Parsing [sent. 7876 len. 12]: I thought it better to leave all the rest to him .
Parsing [sent. 7877 len. 18]: He only said afterwards , that he could hardly get the old man away from the body .
Parsing [sent. 7878 len. 34]: But when I went in next day , I found Tomkins sitting , disconsolate , but as comfortable as he could be , in the easy chair by the side of the fire .
Parsing [sent. 7879 len. 7]: Mrs Rogers was bustling about cheerily .
Parsing [sent. 7880 len. 8]: The storm had died in the night .
Parsing [sent. 7881 len. 5]: The sun was shining .
Parsing [sent. 7882 len. 9]: It was the first of the spring weather .
Parsing [sent. 7883 len. 8]: The whole country was gleaming with water .
Parsing [sent. 7884 len. 17]: But soon it would sink away , and the grass be the thicker for its rising .
Parsing [sent. 7885 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXXI .
Parsing [sent. 7886 len. 5]: A COUNCIL OF FRIENDS .
Parsing [sent. 7887 len. 34]: My reader will easily believe that I returned home that Sunday evening somewhat jaded , nor will he be surprised if I say that next morning I felt disinclined to leave my bed .
Parsing [sent. 7888 len. 22]: I was able , however , to rise and go , as I have said , to Old Rogers 's cottage .
Parsing [sent. 7889 len. 26]: But when I came home , I could no longer conceal from myself that I was in danger of a return of my last attack .
Parsing [sent. 7890 len. 26]: I had been sitting for hours in wet clothes , with my boots full of water , and now I had to suffer for it .
Parsing [sent. 7891 len. 44]: But as I was not to blame in the matter , and had no choice offered me whether I should be wet or dry while I sat by the dying woman , I felt no depression at the prospect of the coming illness .
Parsing [sent. 7892 len. 27]: Indeed , I was too much depressed from other causes , from mental strife and hopelessness , to care much whether I was well or ill .
Parsing [sent. 7893 len. 44]: I could have welcomed death in the mood in which I sometimes felt myself during the next few days , when I was unable to leave my bed , and knew that Captain Everard was at the Hall , and knew nothing besides .
Parsing [sent. 7894 len. 22]: For no voice reached me from that quarter any more than if Oldcastle Hall had been a region beyond the grave .
Parsing [sent. 7895 len. 73]: Miss Oldcastle seemed to have vanished from my ken as much as Catherine Weir and Mrs Tomkins -- yes , more -- for there was only death between these and me ; whereas , there was something far worse -- I could not always tell what -- that rose ever between Miss Oldcastle and myself , and paralysed any effort I might fancy myself on the point of making for her rescue .
Parsing [sent. 7896 len. 5]: One pleasant thing happened .
Parsing [sent. 7897 len. 13]: On the Thursday , I think it was , I felt better .
Parsing [sent. 7898 len. 20]: My sister came into my room and said that Miss Crowther had called , and wanted to see me .
Parsing [sent. 7899 len. 8]: `` Which Miss Crowther is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7900 len. 3]: I asked .
Parsing [sent. 7901 len. 17]: `` The little lady that looks like a bird , and chirps when she talks . ''
Parsing [sent. 7902 len. 17]: Of course I was no longer in any doubt as to which of them it was .
Parsing [sent. 7903 len. 15]: `` You told her I had a bad cold , did you not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7904 len. 5]: `` Oh , yes .
Parsing [sent. 7905 len. 21]: But she says if it is only a cold , it will do you no harm to see her . ''
Parsing [sent. 7906 len. 15]: `` But you told her I was in bed , did n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7907 len. 4]: `` Of course .
Parsing [sent. 7908 len. 6]: But it makes no difference .
Parsing [sent. 7909 len. 29]: She says she 's used to seeing sick folk in bed ; and if you do n't mind seeing her , she does n't mind seeing you . ''
Parsing [sent. 7910 len. 14]: `` Well , I suppose I must see her , '' I said .
Parsing [sent. 7911 len. 14]: So my sister made me a little tidier , and introduced Miss Crowther .
Parsing [sent. 7912 len. 11]: `` O dear Mr Walton , I am SO sorry !
Parsing [sent. 7913 len. 11]: But you 're not very ill , are you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7914 len. 8]: `` I hope not , Miss Jemima .
Parsing [sent. 7915 len. 21]: Indeed , I begin to think this morning that I am going to get off easier than I expected . ''
Parsing [sent. 7916 len. 7]: `` I am glad of that .
Parsing [sent. 7917 len. 5]: Now listen to me .
Parsing [sent. 7918 len. 15]: I wo n't keep you , and it is a matter of some importance .
Parsing [sent. 7919 len. 28]: I hear that one of your people is dead , a young woman of the name of Weir , who has left a little boy behind her .
Parsing [sent. 7920 len. 32]: Now , I have been wanting for a long time to adopt a child -- '' `` But , '' I interrupted her , `` What would Miss Hester say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7921 len. 64]: `` My sister is not so very dreadful as perhaps you think her , Mr Walton ; and besides , when I do want my own way very particularly , which is not often , for there are not so many things that it 's worth while insisting upon -- but when I DO want my own way , I always have it .
Parsing [sent. 7922 len. 14]: I then stand upon my right of -- what do you call it ?
Parsing [sent. 7923 len. 9]: -- primo -- primogeniture -- that 's it !
Parsing [sent. 7924 len. 13]: Well , I think I know something of this child 's father .
Parsing [sent. 7925 len. 23]: I am sorry to say I do n't know much good of him , and that 's the worse for the boy .
Parsing [sent. 7926 len. 23]: Still -- '' `` The boy is an uncommonly sweet and lovable child , whoever was his father , '' I interposed .
Parsing [sent. 7927 len. 9]: `` I am very glad to hear it .
Parsing [sent. 7928 len. 9]: I am the more determined to adopt him .
Parsing [sent. 7929 len. 6]: What friends has he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7930 len. 31]: `` He has a grandfather , and an uncle and aunt , and will have a godfather -- that 's me -- in a few days , I hope . ''
Parsing [sent. 7931 len. 9]: `` I am very glad to hear it .
Parsing [sent. 7932 len. 16]: There will be no opposition on the part of the relatives , I presume ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7933 len. 9]: `` I am not so sure of that .
Parsing [sent. 7934 len. 12]: I fear I shall object for one , Miss Jemima . ''
Parsing [sent. 7935 len. 3]: `` You ?
Parsing [sent. 7936 len. 16]: I did n't expect that of you , Mr Walton , I must say . ''
Parsing [sent. 7937 len. 20]: And there was a tremor in the old lady 's voice more of disappointment and hurt than of anger .
Parsing [sent. 7938 len. 30]: `` I will think it over , though , and talk about it to his grandfather , and we shall find out what 's best , I do hope .
Parsing [sent. 7939 len. 14]: You must not think I should not like you to have him . ''
Parsing [sent. 7940 len. 7]: `` Thank you , Mr Walton .
Parsing [sent. 7941 len. 8]: Then I wo n't stay longer now .
Parsing [sent. 7942 len. 20]: But I warn you I will call again very soon , if you do n't come to see me .
Parsing [sent. 7943 len. 4]: Good morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 7944 len. 41]: And the dear old lady shook hands with me and left me rather hurriedly , turning at the door , however , to add -- `` Mind , I 've set my heart upon having the boy , Mr Walton .
Parsing [sent. 7945 len. 7]: I 've seen him often . ''
Parsing [sent. 7946 len. 14]: What could have made Miss Crowther take such a fancy to the boy ?
Parsing [sent. 7947 len. 32]: I could not help associating it with what I had heard of her youthful disappointment , but never having had my conjectures confirmed , I will say no more about them .
Parsing [sent. 7948 len. 41]: Of course I talked the matter over with Thomas Weir ; but , as I had suspected , I found that he was now as unwilling to part with the boy as he had formerly disliked the sight of him .
Parsing [sent. 7949 len. 74]: Nor did I press the matter at all , having a belief that the circumstances of one 's natal position are not to be rudely handled or thoughtlessly altered , besides that I thought Thomas and his daughter ought to have all the comfort and good that were to be got from the presence of the boy whose advent had occasioned them so much trouble and sorrow , yea , and sin too .
Parsing [sent. 7950 len. 14]: But I did not give a positive and final refusal to Miss Crowther .
Parsing [sent. 7951 len. 20]: I only said `` for the present ; '' for I did not feel at liberty to go further .
Parsing [sent. 7952 len. 49]: I thought that such changes might take place as would render the trial of such a new relationship desirable ; as , indeed , it turned out in the end , though I can not tell the story now , but must keep it for a possible future .
Parsing [sent. 7953 len. 47]: I have , I think , entirely as yet , followed , in these memoirs , the plan of relating either those things only at which I was present , or , if other things , only in the same mode in which I heard them .
Parsing [sent. 7954 len. 11]: I will now depart from this plan -- for once .
Parsing [sent. 7955 len. 27]: Years passed before some of the following facts were reported to me , but it is only here that they could be interesting to my readers .
Parsing [sent. 7956 len. 26]: At the very time Miss Crowther was with me , as nearly as I can guess , Old Rogers turned into Thomas Weir 's workshop .
Parsing [sent. 7957 len. 39]: The usual , on the present occasion somewhat melancholy , greetings having passed between them , Old Rogers said -- `` Do n't you think , Mr Weir , there 's summat the matter wi ' parson ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7958 len. 7]: `` Overworked , '' returned Weir .
Parsing [sent. 7959 len. 28]: `` He 's lost two , ye see , and had to see them both safe over , as I may say , within the same day .
Parsing [sent. 7960 len. 15]: He 's got a bad cold , I 'm sorry to hear , besides .
Parsing [sent. 7961 len. 8]: Have ye heard of him to-day ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7962 len. 13]: `` Yes , yes ; he 's badly , and in bed .
Parsing [sent. 7963 len. 8]: But that 's not what I mean .
Parsing [sent. 7964 len. 12]: There 's summat on his mind , '' said Old Rogers .
Parsing [sent. 7965 len. 24]: `` Well , I do n't think it 's for you or me to meddle with parson 's mind , '' returned Weir .
Parsing [sent. 7966 len. 14]: `` I 'm not so sure o ' that , '' persisted Rogers .
Parsing [sent. 7967 len. 51]: `` But if I had thought , Mr Weir , as how you would be ready to take me up short for mentionin ' of the thing , I would n't ha ' opened my mouth to you about parson -- leastways , in that way , I mean . ''
Parsing [sent. 7968 len. 12]: `` But what way DO you mean , Old Rogers ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7969 len. 13]: `` Why , about his in ` ards , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 7970 len. 11]: `` I 'm no nearer your meanin ' yet . ''
Parsing [sent. 7971 len. 25]: `` Well , Mr Weir , you and me 's two old fellows , now -- leastways I 'm a deal older than you .
Parsing [sent. 7972 len. 13]: But that does n't signify to what I want to say . ''
Parsing [sent. 7973 len. 13]: And here Old Rogers stuck fast -- according to Weir 's story .
Parsing [sent. 7974 len. 18]: `` It do n't seem easy to say no how , Old Rogers , '' said Weir .
Parsing [sent. 7975 len. 7]: `` Well , it ai n't .
Parsing [sent. 7976 len. 29]: So I must just let it go by the run , and hope the parson , who 'll never know , would forgive me if he did . ''
Parsing [sent. 7977 len. 10]: `` Well , then , what is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7978 len. 36]: `` It 's my opinion that that parson o ' ours -- you see , we knows about it , Mr Weir , though we 're not gentlefolks -- leastways , I 'm none . ''
Parsing [sent. 7979 len. 12]: `` Now , what DO you mean , Old Rogers ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7980 len. 14]: `` Well , I means this -- as how parson 's in love .
Parsing [sent. 7981 len. 8]: There , that 's paid out . ''
Parsing [sent. 7982 len. 21]: `` Suppose he was , I do n't see yet what business that is of yours or mine either . ''
Parsing [sent. 7983 len. 6]: `` Well , I do .
Parsing [sent. 7984 len. 11]: I 'd go to Davie Jones for that man . ''
Parsing [sent. 7985 len. 28]: A heathenish expression , perhaps ; but Weir assured me , with much amusement in his tone , that those were the very words Old Rogers used .
Parsing [sent. 7986 len. 19]: Leaving the expression aside , will the reader think for a moment on the old man 's reasoning ?
Parsing [sent. 7987 len. 15]: My condition WAS his business ; for he was ready to die for me !
Parsing [sent. 7988 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 7989 len. 19]: love does indeed make us all each other 's keeper , just as we were intended to be .
Parsing [sent. 7990 len. 8]: `` But what CAN we do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7991 len. 3]: returned Weir .
Parsing [sent. 7992 len. 32]: Perhaps he was the less inclined to listen to the old man , that he was busy with a coffin for his daughter , who was lying dead down the street .
Parsing [sent. 7993 len. 12]: And so my poor affairs were talked of over the coffin-planks .
Parsing [sent. 7994 len. 10]: Well , well , it was no bad omen .
Parsing [sent. 7995 len. 16]: `` I tell you what , Mr Weir , this here 's a serious business .
Parsing [sent. 7996 len. 31]: And it seems to me it 's not shipshape o ' you to go on with that plane o ' yours , when we 're talkin ' about parson . ''
Parsing [sent. 7997 len. 11]: `` Well , Old Rogers , I meant no offence .
Parsing [sent. 7998 len. 3]: Here goes .
Parsing [sent. 7999 len. 8]: NOW , what have you to say ?
Parsing [sent. 8000 len. 46]: Though if it 's offence to parson you 're speakin ' of , I know , if I were parson , who I 'd think was takin ' the greatest liberty , me wi ' my plane , or you wi ' your fancies . ''
Parsing [sent. 8001 len. 8]: `` Belay there , and hearken . ''
Parsing [sent. 8002 len. 67]: So Old Rogers went into as many particulars as he thought fit , to prove that his suspicion as to the state of my mind was correct ; which particulars I do not care to lay in a collected form before my reader , he being in no need of such a summing up to give his verdict , seeing the parson has already pleaded guilty .
Parsing [sent. 8003 len. 33]: When he had finished , `` Supposing all you say , Old Rogers , '' remarked Thomas , `` I do n't yet see what WE 'VE got to do with it .
Parsing [sent. 8004 len. 11]: Parson ought to know best what he 's about . ''
Parsing [sent. 8005 len. 23]: `` But my daughter tells me , '' said Rogers , `` that Miss Oldcastle has no mind to marry Captain Everard .
Parsing [sent. 8006 len. 16]: And she thinks if parson would only speak out he might have a chance . ''
Parsing [sent. 8007 len. 21]: Weir made no reply , and was silent so long , with his head bent , that Rogers grew impatient .
Parsing [sent. 8008 len. 30]: `` Well , man , ha ' you nothing to say now -- not for your best friend -- on earth , I mean -- and that 's parson ?
Parsing [sent. 8009 len. 19]: It may seem a small matter to you , but it 's no small matter to parson . ''
Parsing [sent. 8010 len. 6]: `` Small to me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8011 len. 23]: said Weir , and taking up his tool , a constant recourse with him when agitated , he began to plane furiously .
Parsing [sent. 8012 len. 22]: Old Rogers now saw that there was more in it than he had thought , and held his peace and waited .
Parsing [sent. 8013 len. 43]: After a minute or two of fierce activity , Thomas lifted up a face more white than the deal board he was planing , and said , `` You should have come to the point a little sooner , Old Rogers . ''
Parsing [sent. 8014 len. 21]: He then laid down his plane , and went out of the workshop , leaving Rogers standing there in bewilderment .
Parsing [sent. 8015 len. 8]: But he was not gone many minutes .
Parsing [sent. 8016 len. 9]: He returned with a letter in his hand .
Parsing [sent. 8017 len. 12]: `` There , '' he said , giving it to Rogers .
Parsing [sent. 8018 len. 14]: `` I ca n't read hand o ' write , '' returned Rogers .
Parsing [sent. 8019 len. 18]: `` I ha ' enough ado with straight-foret print But I 'll take it to parson . ''
Parsing [sent. 8020 len. 21]: `` On no account , '' returned Thomas , emphatically `` That 's not what I gave it you for .
Parsing [sent. 8021 len. 24]: Neither you nor parson has any right to read that letter ; and I do n't want either of you to read it .
Parsing [sent. 8022 len. 6]: Can Jane read writing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8023 len. 41]: `` I do n't know as she can , for , you see , what makes lasses take to writin ' is when their young man 's over the seas , leastways not in the mill over the brook . ''
Parsing [sent. 8024 len. 28]: `` I 'll be back in a minute , '' said Thomas , and taking the letter from Rogers 's hand , he left the shop again .
Parsing [sent. 8025 len. 18]: He returned once more with the letter sealed up in an envelope , addressed to Miss Oldcastle .
Parsing [sent. 8026 len. 39]: `` Now , you tell your Jane to give that to Miss Oldcastle from me -- mind , from ME ; and she must give it into her own hands , and let no one else see it .
Parsing [sent. 8027 len. 7]: And I must have it again .
Parsing [sent. 8028 len. 11]: Mind you tell her all that , Old Rogers . ''
Parsing [sent. 8029 len. 4]: `` I will .
Parsing [sent. 8030 len. 15]: It 's for Miss Oldcastle , and no one else to know o n't .
Parsing [sent. 8031 len. 14]: And you 're to have it again all safe when done with . ''
Parsing [sent. 8032 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 8033 len. 12]: Can you trust Jane not to go talking about it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8034 len. 6]: `` I think I can .
Parsing [sent. 8035 len. 6]: I ought to , anyhow .
Parsing [sent. 8036 len. 15]: But she ca n't know anythink in the letter now , Mr Weir . ''
Parsing [sent. 8037 len. 12]: I know that ; but Marshmallows is a talkin ' place .
Parsing [sent. 8038 len. 13]: And poor Kate ai n't right out o ' hearin ' yet .
Parsing [sent. 8039 len. 18]: -- You 'll come and see her buried to-morrow , wo n't ye , Old Rogers ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8040 len. 6]: `` I will , Thomas .
Parsing [sent. 8041 len. 21]: You 've had a troubled life , but thank God the sun came out a bit before she died . ''
Parsing [sent. 8042 len. 7]: `` That 's true , Rogers .
Parsing [sent. 8043 len. 16]: It 's all right , I do think , though I grumbled long and sore .
Parsing [sent. 8044 len. 10]: But Jane must n't speak of that letter . ''
Parsing [sent. 8045 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 8046 len. 6]: That she sha n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 8047 len. 12]: `` I 'll tell you some day what 's in it .
Parsing [sent. 8048 len. 16]: But I ca n't bear to talk about it yet '' And so they parted .
Parsing [sent. 8049 len. 26]: I was too unwell still either to be able to bury my dead out of my sight or to comfort my living the next Sunday .
Parsing [sent. 8050 len. 23]: I got help from Addicehead , however , and the dead bodies were laid aside in the ancient wardrobe of the tomb .
Parsing [sent. 8051 len. 38]: They were both buried by my vestry-door , Catherine where I had found young Tom lying , namely , in the grave of her mother , and old Mrs Tomkins on the other side of the path .
Parsing [sent. 8052 len. 18]: On Sunday , Rogers gave his daughter the letter , and she carried it to the Hall .
Parsing [sent. 8053 len. 30]: It was not till she had to wait on her mistress before leaving her for the night that she found an opportunity of giving it into her own hands .
Parsing [sent. 8054 len. 25]: Then when her bell rang , Jane went up to her room , and found her so pale and haggard that she was frightened .
Parsing [sent. 8055 len. 31]: She had thrown herself back on the couch , with her hands lying by her sides , as if she cared for nothing in this world or out of it .
Parsing [sent. 8056 len. 18]: But when Jane entered , she started and sat up , and tried to look like herself .
Parsing [sent. 8057 len. 32]: Her face , however , was so pitiful , that honest-hearted Jane could not help crying , upon which the responsive sisterhood overcame the proud lady , and she cried too .
Parsing [sent. 8058 len. 32]: Jane had all but forgotten the letter , of the import of which she had no idea , for her father had taken care to rouse no suspicions in her mind .
Parsing [sent. 8059 len. 43]: But when she saw her cry , the longing to give her something , which comes to us all when we witness trouble -- for giving seems to mean everything-brought to her mind the letter she had undertaken to deliver to her .
Parsing [sent. 8060 len. 48]: Now she had no notion , as I have said , that the letter had anything to do with her present perplexity , but she hoped it might divert her thoughts for a moment , which is all that love at a distance can look for sometimes .
Parsing [sent. 8061 len. 32]: `` Here is a letter , '' said Jane , `` that Mr Weir the carpenter gave to my father to give to me to bring to you , miss . ''
Parsing [sent. 8062 len. 9]: `` What is it about , Jane ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8063 len. 4]: she asked listlessly .
Parsing [sent. 8064 len. 20]: Then a sudden flash broke from her eyes , and she held out her hand eagerly to take it .
Parsing [sent. 8065 len. 29]: She opened it and read it with changing colour , but when she had finished it , her cheeks were crimson , and her eyes glowing like fire .
Parsing [sent. 8066 len. 21]: `` The wretch , '' she said , and threw the letter from her into the middle of the floor .
Parsing [sent. 8067 len. 41]: Jane , who remembered the injunctions of her father as to the safety and return of the letter , stooped to pick it up : but had hardly raised herself when the door opened , and in came Mrs Oldcastle .
Parsing [sent. 8068 len. 28]: The moment she saw her mother , Ethelwyn rose , and advancing to meet her , said , `` Mother , I will NOT marry that man .
Parsing [sent. 8069 len. 15]: You may do what you please with me , but I WILL NOT . ''
Parsing [sent. 8070 len. 4]: `` Heigho ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8071 len. 21]: exclaimed Mrs Oldcastle with spread nostrils , and turning suddenly upon Jane , snatched the letter out of her hand .
Parsing [sent. 8072 len. 17]: She opened and read it , her face getting more still and stony as she read .
Parsing [sent. 8073 len. 18]: Miss Oldcastle stood and looked at her mother with cheeks now pale but with still flashing eyes .
Parsing [sent. 8074 len. 51]: The moment her mother had finished the letter , she walked swiftly to the fire , tearing the letter as she went , and thrust it between the bars , pushing it in fiercely with the poker , and muttering -- `` A vile forgery of those low Chartist wretches !
Parsing [sent. 8075 len. 13]: As if he would ever have looked at one of THEIR women !
Parsing [sent. 8076 len. 15]: A low conspiracy to get money from a gentleman in his honourable position ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8077 len. 24]: And for the first time since she went to the Hall , Jane said , there was colour in that dead white face .
Parsing [sent. 8078 len. 35]: She turned once more , fiercer than ever , upon Jane , and in a tone of rage under powerful repression , began : -- `` You leave the house -- THIS INSTANT . ''
Parsing [sent. 8079 len. 14]: The last two words , notwithstanding her self-command , rose to a scream .
Parsing [sent. 8080 len. 39]: And she came from the fire towards Jane , who stood trembling near the door , with such an expression on her countenance that absolute fear drove her from the room before she knew what she was about .
Parsing [sent. 8081 len. 29]: The locking of the door behind her let her know that she had abandoned her young mistress to the madness of her mother 's evil temper and disposition .
Parsing [sent. 8082 len. 6]: But it was too late .
Parsing [sent. 8083 len. 22]: She lingered by the door and listened , but beyond an occasional hoarse tone of suppressed energy , she heard nothing .
Parsing [sent. 8084 len. 40]: At length the lock -- as suddenly turned , and she was surprised by Mrs Oldcastle , if not in a listening attitude , at least where she had no right to be after the dismissal she had received .
Parsing [sent. 8085 len. 20]: Opposite Miss Oldcastle 's bedroom was another , seldom used , the door of which was now standing open .
Parsing [sent. 8086 len. 21]: Instead of speaking to Jane , Mrs Oldcastle gave her a violent push , which drove her into this room .
Parsing [sent. 8087 len. 9]: Thereupon she shut the door and locked it .
Parsing [sent. 8088 len. 24]: Jane spent the whole of the night in that room , in no small degree of trepidation as to what might happen next .
Parsing [sent. 8089 len. 45]: But she heard no noise all the rest of the night , part of which , however , was spent in sound sleep , for Jane 's conscience was in no ways disturbed as to any part she had played in the current events .
Parsing [sent. 8090 len. 51]: It was not till the morning that she examined the door , to see if she could not manage to get out and escape from the house , for she shared with the rest of the family an indescribable fear of Mrs Oldcastle and her confidante , the White Wolf .
Parsing [sent. 8091 len. 20]: But she found it was of no use : the lock was at least as strong as the door .
Parsing [sent. 8092 len. 29]: Being a sensible girl and self-possessed , as her parents ' child ought to be , she made no noise , but waited patiently for what might come .
Parsing [sent. 8093 len. 25]: At length , hearing a step in the passage , she tapped gently at the door and called , `` Who 's there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8094 len. 6]: The cook 's voice answered .
Parsing [sent. 8095 len. 9]: `` Let me out , '' said Jane .
Parsing [sent. 8096 len. 7]: `` The door 's locked . ''
Parsing [sent. 8097 len. 11]: The cook tried , but found there was no key .
Parsing [sent. 8098 len. 22]: Jane told her how she came there , and the cook promised to get her out as soon as she could .
Parsing [sent. 8099 len. 23]: Meantime all she could do for her was to hand her a loaf of bread on a stick from the next window .
Parsing [sent. 8100 len. 34]: It had been long dark before some one unlocked the door , and left her at liberty to go where she pleased , of which she did not fail to make immediate use .
Parsing [sent. 8101 len. 24]: Unable to find her young mistress , she packed her box , and , leaving it behind her , escaped to her father .
Parsing [sent. 8102 len. 16]: As soon as she had told him the story , he came straight to me .
Parsing [sent. 8103 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXXII .
Parsing [sent. 8104 len. 4]: THE NEXT THING .
Parsing [sent. 8105 len. 25]: As I sat in my study , in the twilight of that same day , the door was hurriedly opened , and Judy entered .
Parsing [sent. 8106 len. 30]: She looked about the room with a quick glance to see that we were alone , then caught my hand in both of hers , and burst out crying .
Parsing [sent. 8107 len. 6]: `` Why , Judy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8108 len. 10]: I said , `` what IS the matter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8109 len. 10]: But the sobs would not allow her to answer .
Parsing [sent. 8110 len. 30]: I was too frightened to put any more questions , and so stood silent -- my chest feeling like an empty tomb that waited for death to fill it .
Parsing [sent. 8111 len. 17]: At length with a strong effort she checked the succession of her sobs , and spoke .
Parsing [sent. 8112 len. 6]: `` They are killing auntie .
Parsing [sent. 8113 len. 17]: She looks like a ghost already , '' said the child , again bursting into tears .
Parsing [sent. 8114 len. 14]: `` Tell me , Judy , what CAN I do for her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8115 len. 9]: `` You must find out , Mr Walton .
Parsing [sent. 8116 len. 19]: If you loved her as much as I do , you would find out what to do . ''
Parsing [sent. 8117 len. 13]: `` But she will not let me do anything for her . ''
Parsing [sent. 8118 len. 6]: `` Yes , she will .
Parsing [sent. 8119 len. 11]: She says you promised to help her some day . ''
Parsing [sent. 8120 len. 9]: `` Did she send you , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8121 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 8122 len. 7]: She did not send me . ''
Parsing [sent. 8123 len. 12]: `` Then how -- what -- what can I do ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8124 len. 7]: `` Oh , you exact people !
Parsing [sent. 8125 len. 12]: You must have everything square and in print before you move .
Parsing [sent. 8126 len. 17]: If it had been me now , would n't I have been off like a shot !
Parsing [sent. 8127 len. 9]: Do get your hat , Mr Walton . ''
Parsing [sent. 8128 len. 7]: `` Come , then , Judy .
Parsing [sent. 8129 len. 6]: I will go at once .
Parsing [sent. 8130 len. 7]: -- Shall I see her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8131 len. 29]: And every vein throbbed at the thought of rescuing her from her persecutors , though I had not yet the smallest idea how it was to be effected .
Parsing [sent. 8132 len. 16]: `` We will talk about that as we go , '' said Judy , authoritatively .
Parsing [sent. 8133 len. 11]: In a moment more we were in the open air .
Parsing [sent. 8134 len. 22]: It was a still night , with an odour of damp earth , and a hint of green buds in it .
Parsing [sent. 8135 len. 35]: A pale half-moon hung in the sky , now and then hidden by the clouds that swept across it , for there was wind in the heavens , though upon earth all was still .
Parsing [sent. 8136 len. 32]: I offered Judy my arm , but she took my hand , and we walked on without a word till we had got through the village and out upon the road .
Parsing [sent. 8137 len. 23]: `` Now , Judy , '' I said at last , `` tell me what they are doing to your aunt ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8138 len. 10]: `` I do n't know what they are doing .
Parsing [sent. 8139 len. 9]: But I am sure she will die . ''
Parsing [sent. 8140 len. 6]: `` Is she ill ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8141 len. 16]: `` She is as white as a sheet , and will not leave her room .
Parsing [sent. 8142 len. 7]: Grannie must have frightened her dreadfully .
Parsing [sent. 8143 len. 16]: Everybody is frightened at her but me , and I begin to be frightened too .
Parsing [sent. 8144 len. 9]: And what will become of auntie then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8145 len. 11]: `` But what can her mother do to her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8146 len. 6]: `` I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 8147 len. 34]: I think it is her determination to have her own way that makes auntie afraid she will get it somehow ; and she says now she will rather die than marry Captain Everard .
Parsing [sent. 8148 len. 29]: Then there is no one allowed to wait on her but Sarah , and I know the very sight of her is enough to turn auntie sick almost .
Parsing [sent. 8149 len. 10]: What has become of Jane I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 8150 len. 18]: I have n't seen her all day , and the servants are whispering together more than usual .
Parsing [sent. 8151 len. 33]: Auntie ca n't eat what Sarah brings her , I am sure ; else I should almost fancy she was starving herself to death to keep clear of that Captain Everard . ''
Parsing [sent. 8152 len. 9]: `` Is he still at the Hall ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8153 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 8154 len. 11]: But I do n't think it is altogether his fault .
Parsing [sent. 8155 len. 7]: Grannie wo n't let him go .
Parsing [sent. 8156 len. 15]: I do n't believe he knows how determined auntie is not to marry him .
Parsing [sent. 8157 len. 34]: Only , to be sure , though grannie never lets her have more than five shillings in her pocket at a time , she will be worth something when she is married . ''
Parsing [sent. 8158 len. 25]: `` Nothing can make her worth more than she is , Judy , '' I said , perhaps with some discontent in my tone .
Parsing [sent. 8159 len. 22]: `` That 's as you and I think , Mr Walton ; not as grannie and the captain think at all .
Parsing [sent. 8160 len. 25]: I daresay he would not care much more than grannie whether she was willing or not , so long as she married him . ''
Parsing [sent. 8161 len. 27]: `` But , Judy , we must have some plan laid before we reach the Hall ; else my coming will be of no use . ''
Parsing [sent. 8162 len. 4]: `` Of course .
Parsing [sent. 8163 len. 17]: I know how much I can do , and you must arrange the rest with her .
Parsing [sent. 8164 len. 16]: I will take you to the little room up-stairs -- we call it the octagon .
Parsing [sent. 8165 len. 10]: That you know is just under auntie 's room .
Parsing [sent. 8166 len. 11]: They will be at dinner -- the captain and grannie .
Parsing [sent. 8167 len. 17]: I will leave you there , and tell auntie that you want to see her . ''
Parsing [sent. 8168 len. 20]: `` But , Judy , -- '' `` Do n't you want to see her , Mr Walton ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8169 len. 13]: `` Yes , I do ; more than you can think . ''
Parsing [sent. 8170 len. 9]: `` Then I will tell her so . ''
Parsing [sent. 8171 len. 9]: `` But will she come to me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8172 len. 6]: `` I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 8173 len. 8]: We have to find that out . ''
Parsing [sent. 8174 len. 4]: `` Very well .
Parsing [sent. 8175 len. 8]: I leave myself in your hands . ''
Parsing [sent. 8176 len. 6]: I was now perfectly collected .
Parsing [sent. 8177 len. 23]: All my dubitation and distress were gone , for I had something to do , although what I could not yet tell .
Parsing [sent. 8178 len. 45]: That she did not love Captain Everard was plain , and that she had as yet resisted her mother was also plain , though it was not equally certain that she would , if left at her mercy , go on to resist her .
Parsing [sent. 8179 len. 11]: This was what I hoped to strengthen her to do .
Parsing [sent. 8180 len. 10]: I saw nothing more within my reach as yet .
Parsing [sent. 8181 len. 28]: But from what I knew of Miss Oldcastle , I saw plainly enough that no greater good could be done for her than this enabling to resistance .
Parsing [sent. 8182 len. 22]: Self-assertion was so foreign to her nature , that it needed a sense of duty to rouse her even to self-defence .
Parsing [sent. 8183 len. 21]: As I have said before , she was clad in the mail of endurance , but was utterly without weapons .
Parsing [sent. 8184 len. 32]: And there was a danger of her conduct and then of her mind giving way at last , from the gradual inroads of weakness upon the thews which she left unexercised .
Parsing [sent. 8185 len. 14]: In respect of this , I prayed heartily that I might help her .
Parsing [sent. 8186 len. 31]: Judy and I scarcely spoke to each other from the moment we entered the gate till I found myself at a side door which I had never observed till now .
Parsing [sent. 8187 len. 18]: It was fastened , and Judy told me to wait till she went in and opened it .
Parsing [sent. 8188 len. 16]: The moon was now quite obscured , and I was under no apprehension of discovery .
Parsing [sent. 8189 len. 30]: While I stood there I could not help thinking of Dr Duncan 's story , and reflecting that the daughter was now returning the kindness shown to the mother .
Parsing [sent. 8190 len. 22]: I had not to wait long before the door opened behind me noiselessly , and I stepped into the dark house .
Parsing [sent. 8191 len. 24]: Judy took me by the hand , and led me along a passage , and then up a stair into the little drawing-room .
Parsing [sent. 8192 len. 5]: There was no light .
Parsing [sent. 8193 len. 25]: She led me to a seat at the farther end , and opening a door close beside me , left me in the dark .
Parsing [sent. 8194 len. 20]: There I sat so long that I fell into a fit of musing , broken ever by startled expectation .
Parsing [sent. 8195 len. 17]: Castle after castle I built up ; castle after castle fell to pieces in my hands .
Parsing [sent. 8196 len. 6]: Still she did not come .
Parsing [sent. 8197 len. 22]: At length I got so restless and excited that only the darkness kept me from starting up and pacing the room .
Parsing [sent. 8198 len. 25]: Still she did not come , and partly from weakness , partly from hope deferred , I found myself beginning to tremble all over .
Parsing [sent. 8199 len. 6]: Nor could I control myself .
Parsing [sent. 8200 len. 22]: As the trembling increased , I grew alarmed lest I should become unable to carry out all that might be necessary .
Parsing [sent. 8201 len. 13]: Suddenly from out of the dark a hand settled on my arm .
Parsing [sent. 8202 len. 13]: I looked up and could just see the whiteness of a face .
Parsing [sent. 8203 len. 24]: Before I could speak , a voice said brokenly , in a half-whisper : -- `` WILL you save me , Mr Walton ?
Parsing [sent. 8204 len. 18]: But you 're trembling ; you are ill ; you ought not to have come to me .
Parsing [sent. 8205 len. 7]: I will get you something . ''
Parsing [sent. 8206 len. 11]: And she moved to go , but I held her .
Parsing [sent. 8207 len. 9]: All my trembling was gone in a moment .
Parsing [sent. 8208 len. 22]: Her words , so careful of me even in her deep misery , went to my heart and gave me strength .
Parsing [sent. 8209 len. 11]: The suppressed feelings of many months rushed to my lips .
Parsing [sent. 8210 len. 19]: What I said I do not know , but I know that I told her I loved her .
Parsing [sent. 8211 len. 17]: And I know that she did not draw her hand from mine when I said so .
Parsing [sent. 8212 len. 10]: But ere I ceased came a revulsion of feeling .
Parsing [sent. 8213 len. 33]: `` Forgive me , '' I said , `` I am selfishness itself to speak to you thus now , to take advantage of your misery to make you listen to mine .
Parsing [sent. 8214 len. 47]: But , at least , it will make you sure that if all I am , all I have will save you -- '' `` But I am saved already , '' she interposed , `` if you love me -- for I love you . ''
Parsing [sent. 8215 len. 11]: And for some moments there were no words to speak .
Parsing [sent. 8216 len. 13]: I stood holding her hand , conscious only of God and her .
Parsing [sent. 8217 len. 15]: At last I said : `` There is no time now but for action .
Parsing [sent. 8218 len. 13]: Nor do I see anything but to go with me at once .
Parsing [sent. 8219 len. 8]: Will you come home to my sister ?
Parsing [sent. 8220 len. 10]: Or I will take you wherever you please . ''
Parsing [sent. 8221 len. 11]: `` I will go with you anywhere you think best .
Parsing [sent. 8222 len. 6]: Only take me away . ''
Parsing [sent. 8223 len. 25]: `` Put on your bonnet , then , and a warm cloak , and we will settle all about it as we go . ''
Parsing [sent. 8224 len. 14]: She had scarcely left the room when Mrs Oldcastle came to the door .
Parsing [sent. 8225 len. 6]: `` No lights here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8226 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 8227 len. 24]: `` Sarah , bring candles , and tell Captain Everard , when he will join us , to come to the octagon room .
Parsing [sent. 8228 len. 7]: Where can that little Judy be ?
Parsing [sent. 8229 len. 12]: The child gets more and more troublesome , I do think .
Parsing [sent. 8230 len. 8]: I must take her in hand . ''
Parsing [sent. 8231 len. 62]: I had been in great perplexity how to let her know that I was there ; for to announce yourself to a lady by a voice out of the darkness of her boudoir , or to wait for candles to discover you where she thought she was quite alone -- neither is a pleasant way of presenting yourself to her consciousness .
Parsing [sent. 8232 len. 23]: But I was helped out of the beginning into the middle of my difficulties , once more by that blessed little Judy .
Parsing [sent. 8233 len. 15]: I did not know she was in the room till I heard her voice .
Parsing [sent. 8234 len. 64]: Nor do I yet know how much she had heard of the conversation between her aunt and myself ; for although I sometimes see her look roguish even now that she is a middle-aged woman with many children , when anything is said which might be supposed to have a possible reference to that night , I have never cared to ask her .
Parsing [sent. 8235 len. 13]: `` Here I '' am , grannie , '' said her voice .
Parsing [sent. 8236 len. 16]: `` But I wo n't be taken in hand by you or any one else .
Parsing [sent. 8237 len. 5]: I tell you that .
Parsing [sent. 8238 len. 3]: So mind .
Parsing [sent. 8239 len. 22]: And Mr Walton is here , too , and Aunt Ethelwyn is going out with him for a long walk . ''
Parsing [sent. 8240 len. 11]: `` What do you mean , you silly child ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8241 len. 25]: `` I mean what I say , '' and `` Miss Judy speaks the truth , '' fell together from her lips and mine .
Parsing [sent. 8242 len. 32]: `` Mr Walton , '' began Mrs Oldcastle , indignantly , `` it is scarcely like a gentleman to come where you are not wanted -- '' Here Judy interrupted her .
Parsing [sent. 8243 len. 17]: `` I beg your pardon , grannie , Mr Walton WAS wanted -- very much wanted .
Parsing [sent. 8244 len. 7]: I went and fetched him . ''
Parsing [sent. 8245 len. 8]: But Mrs Oldcastle went on unheeding . ''
Parsing [sent. 8246 len. 14]: -- and to be sitting in my room in the dark too ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8247 len. 9]: `` That could n't be helped , grannie .
Parsing [sent. 8248 len. 7]: Here comes Sarah with candles . ''
Parsing [sent. 8249 len. 22]: `` Sarah , '' said Mrs Oldcastle , `` ask Captain Everard to be kind enough to step this way . ''
Parsing [sent. 8250 len. 22]: `` Yes , ma'am , '' answered Sarah , with an untranslatable look at me as she set down the candles .
Parsing [sent. 8251 len. 7]: We could now see each other .
Parsing [sent. 8252 len. 24]: Knowing words to be but idle breath , I would not complicate matters by speech , but stood silent , regarding Mrs Oldcastle .
Parsing [sent. 8253 len. 19]: She on her part did not flinch , but returned my look with one both haughty and contemptuous .
Parsing [sent. 8254 len. 23]: In a few moments , Captain Everard entered , bowed slightly , and looked to Mrs Oldcastle as if for an explanation .
Parsing [sent. 8255 len. 8]: Whereupon she spoke , but to me .
Parsing [sent. 8256 len. 29]: `` Mr Walton , '' she said , `` will you explain to Captain Everard to what we owe the UNEXPECTED pleasure of a visit from you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8257 len. 12]: `` Captain Everard has no claim to any explanation from me .
Parsing [sent. 8258 len. 25]: To you , Mrs Oldcastle , I would have answered , had you asked me , that I was waiting for Miss Oldcastle . ''
Parsing [sent. 8259 len. 19]: `` Pray inform Miss Oldcastle , Judy , that Mr Walton insists upon seeing her at once . ''
Parsing [sent. 8260 len. 6]: `` That is quite unnecessary .
Parsing [sent. 8261 len. 11]: Miss Oldcastle will be here presently , '' I said .
Parsing [sent. 8262 len. 8]: Mrs Oldcastle turned slightly livid with wrath .
Parsing [sent. 8263 len. 31]: She was always white , as I have said : the change I can describe only by the word I have used , indicating a bluish darkening of the whiteness .
Parsing [sent. 8264 len. 8]: She walked towards the door beside me .
Parsing [sent. 8265 len. 7]: I stepped between her and it .
Parsing [sent. 8266 len. 7]: `` Pardon me , Mrs Oldcastle .
Parsing [sent. 8267 len. 10]: That is the way to Miss Oldcastle 's room .
Parsing [sent. 8268 len. 8]: I am here to protect her . ''
Parsing [sent. 8269 len. 12]: Without saying a word she turned and looked at Captain Everard .
Parsing [sent. 8270 len. 9]: He advanced with a long stride of determination .
Parsing [sent. 8271 len. 30]: But ere he reached me , the door behind me opened , and Miss Oldcastle appeared in her bonnet and shawl , catrying a small bag in her hand .
Parsing [sent. 8272 len. 26]: Seeing how things were , the moment she entered , she put her hand on my arm , and stood fronting the enemy with me .
Parsing [sent. 8273 len. 31]: Judy was on my right , her eyes flashing , and her cheek as red as a peony , evidently prepared to do battle a toute outrance for her friends .
Parsing [sent. 8274 len. 32]: `` Miss Oldcastle , go to your room instantly , I COMMAND you , '' said her mother ; and she approached as if to remove her hand from my arm .
Parsing [sent. 8275 len. 11]: I put my other arm between her and her daughter .
Parsing [sent. 8276 len. 10]: `` No , Mrs Oldcastle , '' I said .
Parsing [sent. 8277 len. 41]: `` You have lost all a mother 's rights by ceasing to behave like a mother , Miss Oldcastle will never more do anything in obedience to your commands , whatever she may do in compliance with your wishes . ''
Parsing [sent. 8278 len. 26]: `` Allow me to remark , '' said Captain Everard , with attempted nonchalance , `` that that is strange doctrine for your cloth . ''
Parsing [sent. 8279 len. 31]: `` So much the worse for my cloth , then , '' I answered , `` and the better for yours if it leads you to act more honourably . ''
Parsing [sent. 8280 len. 27]: Still keeping himself entrenched in the affectation of a supercilious indifference , he smiled haughtily , and gave a look of dramatic appeal to Mrs Oldcastle .
Parsing [sent. 8281 len. 31]: `` At least , '' said that lady , `` do not disgrace yourself , Ethelwyn , by leaving the house in this unaccountable manner at night and on foot .
Parsing [sent. 8282 len. 19]: If you WILL leave the protection of your mother 's roof , wait at least till tomorrow . ''
Parsing [sent. 8283 len. 20]: `` I would rather spend the night in the open air than pass another under your roof , mother .
Parsing [sent. 8284 len. 14]: You have been a strange mother to me -- and Dorothy too ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8285 len. 17]: `` At least do not put your character in question by going in this unmaidenly fashion .
Parsing [sent. 8286 len. 14]: People will talk to your prejudice -- and Mr Walton 's too . ''
Parsing [sent. 8287 len. 3]: Ethelwyn smiled .
Parsing [sent. 8288 len. 19]: -- She was now as collected as I was , seeming to have cast off all her weakness .
Parsing [sent. 8289 len. 10]: My heart was uplifted more than I can say .
Parsing [sent. 8290 len. 17]: -- She knew her mother too well to be caught by the change in her tone .
Parsing [sent. 8291 len. 29]: I had not hitherto interrupted her once when she took the answer upon herself , for she was not one to be checked when she chose to speak .
Parsing [sent. 8292 len. 19]: But now she answered nothing , only looked at me , and I understood her , of course .
Parsing [sent. 8293 len. 22]: `` They will hardly have time to do so , I trust , before it will be out of their power .
Parsing [sent. 8294 len. 14]: It rests with Miss Oldcastle herself to say when that shall be . ''
Parsing [sent. 8295 len. 22]: As if she had never suspected that such was the result of her scheming , Mrs Oldcastle 's demeanour changed utterly .
Parsing [sent. 8296 len. 8]: The form of her visage was altered .
Parsing [sent. 8297 len. 15]: She made a spring at her daughter , and seized her by the arm .
Parsing [sent. 8298 len. 17]: `` Then I forbid it , '' she screamed ; `` and I WILL be obeyed .
Parsing [sent. 8299 len. 6]: I stand on my rights .
Parsing [sent. 8300 len. 9]: Go to your room , you minx . ''
Parsing [sent. 8301 len. 17]: `` There is no law human or divine to prevent her from marrying whom she will .
Parsing [sent. 8302 len. 8]: How old are you , Ethelwyn ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8303 len. 12]: I thought it better to seem even cooler than I was .
Parsing [sent. 8304 len. 8]: `` Twenty-seven , '' answered Miss Oldcastle .
Parsing [sent. 8305 len. 27]: `` Is it possible you can be so foolish , Mrs Oldcastle , as to think you have the slightest hold on your daughter 's freedom ?
Parsing [sent. 8306 len. 6]: Let her arm go . ''
Parsing [sent. 8307 len. 6]: But she kept her grasp .
Parsing [sent. 8308 len. 12]: `` You hurt me , mother , '' said Miss Oldcastle .
Parsing [sent. 8309 len. 4]: `` Hurt you ?
Parsing [sent. 8310 len. 4]: you smooth-faced hypocrite !
Parsing [sent. 8311 len. 7]: I will hurt you then ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8312 len. 18]: But I took Mrs Oldcastle 's arm in my hand , and she let go her hold .
Parsing [sent. 8313 len. 9]: `` How dare you touch a woman ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8314 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 8315 len. 19]: `` Because she has so far ceased to be a woman as to torture her own daughter . ''
Parsing [sent. 8316 len. 20]: Here Captain Everard stepped forward , saying , -- `` The riot-act ought to be read , I think .
Parsing [sent. 8317 len. 10]: It is time for the military to interfere . ''
Parsing [sent. 8318 len. 11]: `` Well put , Captain Everard , '' I said .
Parsing [sent. 8319 len. 17]: `` Our side will disperse if you will only leave room for us to go . ''
Parsing [sent. 8320 len. 15]: `` Possibly _ I _ may have something to say in the matter . ''
Parsing [sent. 8321 len. 5]: `` Say on . ''
Parsing [sent. 8322 len. 8]: `` This lady has jilted me . ''
Parsing [sent. 8323 len. 7]: `` Have you , Ethelwyn ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8324 len. 6]: `` I have not . ''
Parsing [sent. 8325 len. 10]: `` Then , Captain Everard , you lie . ''
Parsing [sent. 8326 len. 9]: `` You dare to tell me so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8327 len. 7]: And he strode a pace nearer .
Parsing [sent. 8328 len. 6]: `` It needs no daring .
Parsing [sent. 8329 len. 21]: I know you too well ; and so does another who trusted you and found you false as hell . ''
Parsing [sent. 8330 len. 17]: `` You presume on your cloth , but -- '' he said , lifting his hand .
Parsing [sent. 8331 len. 24]: `` You may strike me , presuming on my cloth , '' I answered ; `` and I will not return your blow .
Parsing [sent. 8332 len. 12]: Insult me as you will , and I will bear it .
Parsing [sent. 8333 len. 10]: Call me coward , and I will say nothing .
Parsing [sent. 8334 len. 34]: But lay one hand on me to prevent me from doing my duty , and I knock you down -- or find you more of a man than I take you for . ''
Parsing [sent. 8335 len. 16]: It was either conscience or something not so good that made a coward of him .
Parsing [sent. 8336 len. 6]: He turned on his heel .
Parsing [sent. 8337 len. 14]: `` I really am not sufficiently interested in the affair to oppose you .
Parsing [sent. 8338 len. 8]: You may take the girl for me .
Parsing [sent. 8339 len. 12]: Both your cloth and the presence of ladies protect your insolence .
Parsing [sent. 8340 len. 11]: I do not like brawling where one can not fight .
Parsing [sent. 8341 len. 12]: You shall hear from me before long , Mr Walton . ''
Parsing [sent. 8342 len. 13]: `` No , Captain Everard , I shall not hear from you .
Parsing [sent. 8343 len. 9]: You know you dare not write to me .
Parsing [sent. 8344 len. 25]: I know that of you which , even on the code of the duellist , would justify any gentleman in refusing to meet you .
Parsing [sent. 8345 len. 7]: Stand out of my way ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8346 len. 9]: I advanced with Miss Oldcastle on my arm .
Parsing [sent. 8347 len. 10]: He drew back ; and we left the room .
Parsing [sent. 8348 len. 37]: As we reached the door , Judy bounded after us , threw her arms round her aunt 's neck , then round mine , kissing us both , and returned to her place on the sofa .
Parsing [sent. 8349 len. 13]: Mrs Oldcastle gave a scream , and sunk fainting on a chair .
Parsing [sent. 8350 len. 13]: It was a last effort to detain her daughter and gain time .
Parsing [sent. 8351 len. 13]: Miss Oldcastle would have returned , but I would not permit her .
Parsing [sent. 8352 len. 15]: `` No , '' I said ; `` she will be better without you .
Parsing [sent. 8353 len. 9]: Judy , ring the bell for Sarah . ''
Parsing [sent. 8354 len. 11]: `` How dare you give orders in my house ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8355 len. 18]: exclaimed Mrs Oldcastle , sitting bolt upright in the chair , and shaking her fist at us .
Parsing [sent. 8356 len. 19]: Then assuming the heroic , she added , `` From this moment she is no daughter of mine .
Parsing [sent. 8357 len. 12]: Nor can you touch one farthing of her money , sir .
Parsing [sent. 8358 len. 18]: You have married a beggar after all , and that you 'll both know before long . ''
Parsing [sent. 8359 len. 8]: `` Thy money perish with thee ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8360 len. 12]: I said , and repented the moment I had said it .
Parsing [sent. 8361 len. 28]: It sounded like an imprecation , and I know I had no correspondent feeling ; for , after all , she was the mother of my Ethelwyn .
Parsing [sent. 8362 len. 23]: But the allusion to money made me so indignant , that the words burst from me ere I could consider their import .
Parsing [sent. 8363 len. 23]: The cool wind greeted us like the breath of God , as we left the house and closed the door behind us .
Parsing [sent. 8364 len. 31]: The moon was shining from the edge of a vaporous mountain , which gradually drew away from her , leaving her alone in the midst of a lake of blue .
Parsing [sent. 8365 len. 32]: But we had not gone many paces from the house when Miss Oldcastle began to tremble violently , and could scarcely get along with all the help I could give her .
Parsing [sent. 8366 len. 22]: Nor , for the space of six weeks did one word pass between us about the painful occurrences of that evening .
Parsing [sent. 8367 len. 12]: For all that time she was quite unable to bear it .
Parsing [sent. 8368 len. 36]: When we managed at last to reach the vicarage , I gave her in charge to my sister , with instructions to help her to bed at once , while I went for Dr Duncan .
Parsing [sent. 8369 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXXIII .
Parsing [sent. 8370 len. 5]: OLD ROGERS 'S THANKSGIVING .
Parsing [sent. 8371 len. 24]: I found the old man seated at his dinner , which he left immediately when he heard that Miss Oldcastle needed his help .
Parsing [sent. 8372 len. 47]: In a few words I told him , as we went , the story of what had befallen at the Hall , to which he listened with the interest of a boy reading a romance , asking twenty questions about the particulars which I hurried over .
Parsing [sent. 8373 len. 38]: Then he shook me warmly by the hand , saying -- `` You have fairly won her , Walton , and I am as glad of it as I could be of anything I can think of .
Parsing [sent. 8374 len. 10]: She is well worth all you must have suffered .
Parsing [sent. 8375 len. 12]: This will at length remove the curse from that wretched family .
Parsing [sent. 8376 len. 16]: You have saved her from perhaps even a worse fate than her sister 's . ''
Parsing [sent. 8377 len. 24]: `` I fear she will be ill , though , '' I said , `` after all that she has gone through . ''
Parsing [sent. 8378 len. 12]: But I did not even suspect how ill she would be .
Parsing [sent. 8379 len. 34]: As soon as I heard Dr Duncan 's opinion of her , which was not very definite , a great fear seized upon me that I was destined to lose her after all .
Parsing [sent. 8380 len. 22]: This fear , however , terrible as it was , did not torture me like the fear that had preceded it .
Parsing [sent. 8381 len. 19]: I could oftener feel able to say , `` Thy will be done '' than I could before .
Parsing [sent. 8382 len. 20]: Dr Duncan was hardly out of the house when Old Rogers arrived , and was shown into the study .
Parsing [sent. 8383 len. 4]: He looked excited .
Parsing [sent. 8384 len. 20]: I allowed him to tell out his story , which was his daughter 's of course , without interruption .
Parsing [sent. 8385 len. 17]: He ended by saying : -- `` Now , sir , you really must do summat .
Parsing [sent. 8386 len. 9]: This wo n't do in a Christian country .
Parsing [sent. 8387 len. 18]: We ai n't aboard ship here with a nor ' - easter a-walkin ' the quarter-deck . ''
Parsing [sent. 8388 len. 16]: `` There 's no occasion , my dear old fellow , to do anything . ''
Parsing [sent. 8389 len. 5]: He was taken aback .
Parsing [sent. 8390 len. 12]: `` Well , I do n't understand you , Mr Walton .
Parsing [sent. 8391 len. 17]: You 're the last man I 'd have expected to hear argufy for faith without works .
Parsing [sent. 8392 len. 42]: It 's right to trust in God ; but if you do n't stand to your halliards , your craft 'll miss stays , and your faith 'll be blown out of the bolt-ropes in the turn of a marlinspike . ''
Parsing [sent. 8393 len. 20]: I suspect there was some confusion in the figure , but the old man 's meaning was plain enough .
Parsing [sent. 8394 len. 12]: Nor would I keep him in a moment more of suspense .
Parsing [sent. 8395 len. 15]: `` Miss Oldcastle is in the house , Old Rogers , '' I said .
Parsing [sent. 8396 len. 7]: `` What house , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8397 len. 14]: returned the old man , his gray eyes opening wider as he spoke .
Parsing [sent. 8398 len. 9]: `` This house , to be sure . ''
Parsing [sent. 8399 len. 45]: I shall never forget the look the old man cast upwards , or the reality given to it by the ordinarily odd sailor-fashion of pulling his forelock , as he returned inward thanks to the Father of all for His kindness to his friend .
Parsing [sent. 8400 len. 47]: And never in my now wide circle of readers shall I find one , the most educated and responsive , who will listen to my story with a more gracious interest than that old man showed as I recounted to him the adventures of the evening .
Parsing [sent. 8401 len. 35]: There were few to whom I could have told them : to Old Rogers I felt that it was right and natural and dignified to tell the story even of my love 's victory .
Parsing [sent. 8402 len. 14]: How then am I able to tell it to the world as now ?
Parsing [sent. 8403 len. 8]: I can easily explain the seeming inconsistency .
Parsing [sent. 8404 len. 146]: It is not merely that I am speaking , as I have said before , from behind a screen , or as clothed in the coat of darkness of an anonymous writer ; but I find that , as I come nearer and nearer to the invisible world , all my brothers and sisters grow dearer and dearer to me ; I feel towards them more and more as the children of my Father in heaven ; and although some of them are good children and some naughty children , some very lovable and some hard to love , yet I never feel that they are below me , or unfit to listen to the story even of my love , if they only care to listen ; and if they do not care , there is no harm done , except they read it .
Parsing [sent. 8405 len. 117]: Even should they , and then scoff at what seemed and seems to me the precious story , I have these defences : first , that it was not for them that I cast forth my precious pearls , for precious to me is the significance of every fact in my history -- not that it is mine , for I have only been as clay in the hands of the potter , but that it is God 's , who made my history as it seemed and was good to Him ; and second , that even should they trample them under their feet , they can not well get at me to rend me .
Parsing [sent. 8406 len. 44]: And more , the nearer I come to the region beyond , the more I feel that in that land a man needs not shrink from uttering his deepest thoughts , inasmuch as he that understands them not will not therefore revile him .
Parsing [sent. 8407 len. 9]: -- `` But you are not there yet .
Parsing [sent. 8408 len. 19]: You are in the land in which the brother speaketh evil of that which he understandeth not . ''
Parsing [sent. 8409 len. 8]: -- True , friend ; too true .
Parsing [sent. 8410 len. 42]: But I only do as Dr Donne did in writing that poem in his sickness , when he thought he was near to the world of which we speak : I rehearse now , that I may find it easier then .
Parsing [sent. 8411 len. 52]: `` Since I am coming to that holy room , Where , with the choir of saints for evermore , I shall be made thy music , as I come , I tune the instrument here at the door ; And what I must do then , think here before . ''
Parsing [sent. 8412 len. 26]: When Rogers had thanked God , he rose , took my hand , and said : -- `` Mr Walton , you WILL preach now .
Parsing [sent. 8413 len. 19]: I thank God for the good we shall all get from the trouble you have gone through . ''
Parsing [sent. 8414 len. 14]: `` I ought to be the better for it , '' I answered .
Parsing [sent. 8415 len. 13]: `` You WILL be the better for it , '' he returned .
Parsing [sent. 8416 len. 21]: `` I believe I 've allus been the better for any trouble as ever I had to go through with .
Parsing [sent. 8417 len. 29]: I could n't quite say the same for every bit of good luck I had ; leastways , I considei trouble the best luck a man can have .
Parsing [sent. 8418 len. 10]: And I wish you a good night , sir .
Parsing [sent. 8419 len. 3]: Thank God !
Parsing [sent. 8420 len. 3]: again . ''
Parsing [sent. 8421 len. 24]: `` But , Rogers , you do n't mean it would be good for us to have bad luck always , do you ?
Parsing [sent. 8422 len. 18]: You should n't be pleased at what 's come to me now , in that case . ''
Parsing [sent. 8423 len. 9]: `` No , sir , sartinly not . ''
Parsing [sent. 8424 len. 17]: `` How can you say , then , that bad luck is the best luck ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8425 len. 20]: `` I mean the bad luck that comes to us -- not the bad luck that does n't come .
Parsing [sent. 8426 len. 7]: But you 're right , sir .
Parsing [sent. 8427 len. 18]: Good luck or bad luck 's both best when HE sends 'em , as He allus does .
Parsing [sent. 8428 len. 21]: In fac ' , sir , there is no bad luck but what comes out o ' the man hisself .
Parsing [sent. 8429 len. 7]: The rest 's all good . ''
Parsing [sent. 8430 len. 81]: But whether it was the consequence of a reaction from the mental strain I had suffered , or the depressing effect of Miss Oldcastle 's illness coming so close upon the joy of winning her ; or that I was more careless and less anxious to do my duty than I ought to have been -- I greatly fear that Old Rogers must have been painfully disappointed in the sermons which I did preach for several of the following Sundays .
Parsing [sent. 8431 len. 16]: He never even hinted at such a fact , but I felt it much myself .
Parsing [sent. 8432 len. 14]: A man has often to be humbled through failure , especially after success .
Parsing [sent. 8433 len. 47]: I do not clearly know how my failures worked upon me ; but I think a man may sometimes get spiritual good without being conscious of the point of its arrival , or being able to trace the process by which it was wrought in him .
Parsing [sent. 8434 len. 47]: I believe that my failures did work some humility in me , and a certain carelessness of outward success even in spiritual matters , so far as the success affected me , provided only the will of God was done in the dishonour of my weakness .
Parsing [sent. 8435 len. 26]: And I think , but I am not sure , that soon after I approached this condition of mind , I began to preach better .
Parsing [sent. 8436 len. 107]: But still I found for some time that however much the subject of my sermon interested me in my study or in the church or vestry on the Saturday evening ; nay , even although my heart was full of fervour during the prayers and lessons ; no sooner had I begun to speak than the glow died out of the sky of my thoughts ; a dull clearness of the intellectual faculties took its place ; and I was painfully aware that what I could speak without being moved myself was not the most likely utterance to move the feelings of those who only listened .
Parsing [sent. 8437 len. 51]: Still a man may occasionally be used by the Spirit of God as the inglorious `` trumpet of a prophecy '' instead of being inspired with the life of the Word , and hence speaking out of a full heart in testimony of that which he hath known and seen .
Parsing [sent. 8438 len. 110]: I hardly remember when or how I came upon the plan , but now , as often as I find myself in such a condition , I turn away from any attempt to produce a sermon ; and , taking up one of the sayings of our Lord which He himself has said `` are spirit and are life , '' I labour simply to make the people see in it what I see in it ; and when I find that thus my own heart is warmed , I am justified in the hope that the hearts of some at least of my hearers are thereby warmed likewise .
Parsing [sent. 8439 len. 35]: But no doubt the fact that the life of Miss Oldcastle seemed to tremble in the balance , had something to do with those results of which I may have already said too much .
Parsing [sent. 8440 len. 42]: My design had been to go at once to London and make preparation for as early a wedding as she would consent to ; but the very day after I brought her home , life and not marriage was the question .
Parsing [sent. 8441 len. 26]: Dr Duncan looked very grave , and although he gave me all the encouragement he could , all his encouragement did not amount to much .
Parsing [sent. 8442 len. 10]: There was such a lack of vitality about her !
Parsing [sent. 8443 len. 26]: The treatment to which she had been for so long a time subjected had depressed her till life was nearly quenched from lack of hope .
Parsing [sent. 8444 len. 22]: Nor did the sudden change seem able to restore the healthy action of what the old physicians called the animal spirits .
Parsing [sent. 8445 len. 26]: Possibly the strong reaction paralysed their channels , and thus prevented her gladness from reaching her physical nature so as to operate on its health .
Parsing [sent. 8446 len. 8]: Her whole complaint appeared in excessive weakness .
Parsing [sent. 8447 len. 51]: Finding that she fainted after every little excitement , I left her for four weeks entirely to my sister and Dr Duncan , during which time she never saw me ; and it was long before I could venture to stay in her room more than a minute or two .
Parsing [sent. 8448 len. 32]: But as the summer approached she began to show signs of reviving life , and by the end of May was able to be wheeled into the garden in a chair .
Parsing [sent. 8449 len. 13]: During her aunt 's illness , Judy came often to the vicarage .
Parsing [sent. 8450 len. 21]: But Miss Oldcastle was unable to see her any more than myself without the painful consequence which I have mentioned .
Parsing [sent. 8451 len. 25]: So the dear child always came to me in the study , and through her endless vivacity infected me with some of her hope .
Parsing [sent. 8452 len. 12]: For she had no fears whatever about her aunt 's recovery .
Parsing [sent. 8453 len. 61]: I had had some painful apprehensions as to the treatment Judy herself might meet with from her grandmother , and had been doubtful whether I ought not to hive carried her off as well as her aunt ; but the first time she came , which was the next day , she set my mind at rest on that subject .
Parsing [sent. 8454 len. 12]: `` But does your grannie know where you are come ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8455 len. 5]: I had asked her .
Parsing [sent. 8456 len. 21]: `` So well , Mr Walton , '' sne replied , `` that there was no occasion to tell her .
Parsing [sent. 8457 len. 15]: Why should n't I rebel as well as Aunt Wynnie , I wonder ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8458 len. 7]: she added , looking archness itself .
Parsing [sent. 8459 len. 8]: `` How does she bear it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8460 len. 8]: `` Bear what , Mr Walton ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8461 len. 8]: `` The loss of your aunt . ''
Parsing [sent. 8462 len. 13]: `` You do n't think grannie cares about that , do you !
Parsing [sent. 8463 len. 39]: She 's vexed enough at the loss of Captain Everard , -- Do you know , I think he had too much wine yesterday , or he would n't have made quite such a fool of himself . ''
Parsing [sent. 8464 len. 16]: `` I fear he had n't had quite enough to give him courage , Judy .
Parsing [sent. 8465 len. 20]: I daresay he was brave enough once , but a bad conscience soon destroys a man 's courage . ''
Parsing [sent. 8466 len. 13]: `` Why do you call it a bad conscience , Mr Walton ?
Parsing [sent. 8467 len. 29]: I should have thought that a bad conscience was one that would let a girl go on anyhow and say nothing about it to make her uncomfortable . ''
Parsing [sent. 8468 len. 18]: `` You are quite right , Judy ; that is the worst kind of conscience , certainly .
Parsing [sent. 8469 len. 12]: But tell me , how does Mrs Oldcastle bear it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8470 len. 8]: `` You asked me that already . ''
Parsing [sent. 8471 len. 17]: Somehow Judy 's words always seem more pert upon paper than they did upon her lips .
Parsing [sent. 8472 len. 28]: Her naivete , the twinkling light in her eyes , and the smile flitting about her mouth , always modified greatly the expression of her words . ''
Parsing [sent. 8473 len. 13]: -- Grannie never says a word about you or auntie either . ''
Parsing [sent. 8474 len. 15]: `` But you said she was vexed : how do you know that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8475 len. 22]: `` Because ever since the captain went away this morning , she wo n't speak a word to Sarah even . ''
Parsing [sent. 8476 len. 16]: `` Are you not afraid of her locking you up some day or other ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8477 len. 7]: `` Not a bit of it .
Parsing [sent. 8478 len. 6]: Grannie wo n't touch me .
Parsing [sent. 8479 len. 14]: And you should n't tempt me to run away from her like auntie .
Parsing [sent. 8480 len. 4]: I wo n't .
Parsing [sent. 8481 len. 25]: Grannie is a naughty old lady , and I do n't believe anybody loves her but me -- not Sarah , I 'm certain .
Parsing [sent. 8482 len. 25]: Therefore I ca n't leave her , and I wo n't leave her , Mr Walton , whatever you may say about her . ''
Parsing [sent. 8483 len. 15]: `` Indeed , I do n't want you to leave her , Judy . ''
Parsing [sent. 8484 len. 12]: And Judy did not leave her as long as she lived .
Parsing [sent. 8485 len. 20]: And the old lady 's love to that child was at least one redeeming point in her fierce character .
Parsing [sent. 8486 len. 30]: No one can tell how mucn good it may have done her before she died -- though but a few years passed before her soul was required of her .
Parsing [sent. 8487 len. 27]: Before that time came , however , a quarrel took place between her and Sarah , which quarrel I incline to regard as a hopeful sign .
Parsing [sent. 8488 len. 16]: And to this day Judy has never heard how her old grannie treated her mother .
Parsing [sent. 8489 len. 24]: When she learns it now from these pages I think she will be glad that she did not know it before her death .
Parsing [sent. 8490 len. 20]: The old lady would see neither doctor nor parson ; nor would she hear of sending for her daughter .
Parsing [sent. 8491 len. 24]: The only sign of softening that she gave was that once she folded her granddaughter in her arms and wept long and bitterly .
Parsing [sent. 8492 len. 35]: Perhaps the thought of her dying child came back upon her , along with the reflection that the only friend she had was the child of that marriage which she had persecuted to dissolution .
Parsing [sent. 8493 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXXIV .
Parsing [sent. 8494 len. 4]: TOM 'S STORY .
Parsing [sent. 8495 len. 16]: My reader will perceive that this part of my story is drawing to a close .
Parsing [sent. 8496 len. 22]: It embraces but a brief period of my life , and I have plenty more behind not altogether unworthy of record .
Parsing [sent. 8497 len. 34]: But the portions of any man 's life most generally interesting are those in which , while the outward history is most stirring , it derives its chief significance from accompanying conflict within .
Parsing [sent. 8498 len. 71]: It is not the rapid change of events , or the unusual concourse of circumstances that alone can interest the thoughtful mind ; while , on the other hand , internal change and tumult can be ill set forth to the reader , save they be accompanied and in part , at least , occasioned by outward events capable of embodying and elucidating the things that are of themselves unseen .
Parsing [sent. 8499 len. 105]: For man 's life ought to be a whole ; and not to mention the spiritual necessities of our nature -- to leave the fact alone that a man is a mere thing of shreds and patches until his heart is united , as the Psalmist says , to fear the name of God -- to leave these considerations aside , I say , no man 's life is fit for representation as a work of art save in proportion as there has been a significant relation between his outer and inner life , a visible outcome of some sort of harmony between them .
Parsing [sent. 8500 len. 90]: Therefore I chose the portion in which I had suffered most , and in which the outward occurrences of my own life had been most interesting , for the fullest representation ; while I reserve for a more occasional and fragmentary record many things in the way of experience , thought , observation , and facts in the history both of myself and individuals of my flock , which admit of , and indeed require , a more individual treatment than would be altogether suitable to a continuous story .
Parsing [sent. 8501 len. 77]: But before I close this part of my communications with those whom I count my friends , for till they assure me of the contrary I mean to flatter myself with considering my readers generally as such , I must gather up the ends of my thread , and dispose them in such a manner that they shall neither hang too loose , nor yet refuse length enough for what my friend Rogers would call splicing .
Parsing [sent. 8502 len. 12]: It was yet summer when Miss Oldcastle and I were married .
Parsing [sent. 8503 len. 11]: It was to me a day awful in its gladness .
Parsing [sent. 8504 len. 15]: She was now quite well , and no shadow hung upon her half-moon forehead .
Parsing [sent. 8505 len. 32]: We went for a fortnight into Wales , and then returned to the vicarage and the duties of the parish , in which my wife was quite ready to assist me .
Parsing [sent. 8506 len. 59]: Perhaps it would help the wives of some clergymen out of some difficulties , and be their protection against some reproaches , if they would at once take the position with regard to the parishioners which Mrs Walton took , namely , that of their servant , but not in her own right -- in her husband 's .
Parsing [sent. 8507 len. 43]: She saw , and told them so , that the best thing she could do for them was to help me , that she held no office whatever in the parish , and they must apply to me when anything went amiss .
Parsing [sent. 8508 len. 64]: Had she not constantly refused to be a `` judge or a divider , '' she would have been constantly troubled with quarrels too paltry to be referred to me , and which were the sooner forgotten that the litigants were not drawn on further and further into the desert of dispute by the mirage of a justice that could quench no thirst .
Parsing [sent. 8509 len. 61]: Only when any such affair was brought before me , did she use her good offices to bring about a right feeling between the contending parties , generally next-door neighbours , and mostly women , who , being at home all day , found their rights clash in a manner that seldom happened with those that worked in the fields .
Parsing [sent. 8510 len. 19]: Whatever her counsel could do , however , had full scope through me , who earnestly sought it .
Parsing [sent. 8511 len. 20]: And whatever she gave the poor , she gave as a private person , out of her own pocket .
Parsing [sent. 8512 len. 50]: She never administered the communion offering -- that is , after finding out , as she soon did , that it was a source of endless dispute between some of the recipients , who regarded it as their common property , and were never satisfied with what they received .
Parsing [sent. 8513 len. 12]: This is the case in many country parishes , I fear .
Parsing [sent. 8514 len. 154]: As soon as I came to know it , I simply told the recipients that , although the communion offering belonged to them , yet the distribution of it rested entirely with me ; and that I would distribute it neither according to their fancied merits nor the degree of friendship I felt for them , but according to the best judgment I could form as to their necessities ; and if any of them thought these were underrated , they were quite at liberty to make a fresh representation of them to me ; but that I , who knew more about their neighbours than it was likely they did , and was not prejudiced by the personal regards which they could hardly fail to be influenced by , was more likely than they were to arrive at an equitable distribution of the money -- upon my principles if not on theirs .
Parsing [sent. 8515 len. 69]: And at the same time I tried to show them that a very great part of the disputes in the world came from our having a very keen feeling of our own troubles , and a very dull feeling of our neighbour 's ; for if the case was reversed , and our neighbour 's condition became ours , ten to one our judgment would be reversed likewise .
Parsing [sent. 8516 len. 15]: And I think some of them got some sense out of what I said .
Parsing [sent. 8517 len. 72]: But I ever found the great difficulty in my dealing with my people to be the preservation of the authority which was needful for service ; for when the elder serve the younger -- and in many cases it is not age that determines seniority -- they must not forget that without which the service they offer will fail to be received as such by those to whom it is offered .
Parsing [sent. 8518 len. 28]: At the same time they must ever take heed that their claim to authority be founded on the truth , and not on ecclesiastical or social position .
Parsing [sent. 8519 len. 34]: Their standing in the church accredits their offer of service : the service itself can only be accredited by the Truth and the Lord of Truth , who is the servant of all .
Parsing [sent. 8520 len. 24]: But it cost both me and my wife some time and some suffering before we learned how to deport ourselves in these respects .
Parsing [sent. 8521 len. 25]: In the same manner she avoided the too near , because unprofitable , approaches of a portion of the richer part of the community .
Parsing [sent. 8522 len. 54]: For from her probable position in time to come , rather than her position in time past , many of the fashionable people in the county began to call upon her -- in no small degree to her annoyance , simply from the fact that she and they had so little in common .
Parsing [sent. 8523 len. 96]: So , while she performed all towards them that etiquette demanded , she excused herself from the closer intimacy which some of them courted , on the ground of the many duties which naturally fell to the parson 's wife in a country parish like ours ; and I am sure that long before we had gained the footing we now have , we had begun to reap the benefits of this mode of regarding our duty in the parish as one , springing from the same source , and tending to the same end .
Parsing [sent. 8524 len. 43]: The parson 's wife who takes to herself authority in virtue of her position , and the parson 's wife who disclaims all connexion with the professional work of her husband , are equally out of place in being parsons ' wives .
Parsing [sent. 8525 len. 23]: The one who refuses to serve denies her greatest privilege ; the one who will be a mistress receives the greater condemnation .
Parsing [sent. 8526 len. 22]: When the wife is one with her husband , and the husband is worthy , the position will soon reveal itself .
Parsing [sent. 8527 len. 29]: But there can not be many clergymen 's wives amongst my readers ; and I may have occupied more space than reasonable with this `` large discourse . ''
Parsing [sent. 8528 len. 19]: I apologize , and , there is room to fear , go on to do the same again .
Parsing [sent. 8529 len. 28]: As I write I am seated in that little octagonal room overlooking the quarry , with its green lining of trees , and its deep central well .
Parsing [sent. 8530 len. 6]: It is my study now .
Parsing [sent. 8531 len. 37]: My wife is not yet too old to prefer the little room in which she thought and suffered so much , to every other , although the stair that leads to it is high and steep .
Parsing [sent. 8532 len. 26]: Nor do I object to her preference because there is no ready way to reach it save through this : I see her the oftener .
Parsing [sent. 8533 len. 49]: And although I do not like any one to look over my shoulder while I write -- it disconcerts me somehow -- yet the moment the sheet is finished and flung on the heap , it is her property , as the print , reader , is yours .
Parsing [sent. 8534 len. 7]: I hear her step overhead now .
Parsing [sent. 8535 len. 6]: She is opening her window .
Parsing [sent. 8536 len. 16]: Now I hear her door close ; and now her foot is on the stair .
Parsing [sent. 8537 len. 6]: `` Come in , love .
Parsing [sent. 8538 len. 7]: I have just finished another sheet .
Parsing [sent. 8539 len. 4]: There it is .
Parsing [sent. 8540 len. 8]: What shall I end the book with ?
Parsing [sent. 8541 len. 32]: What shall I tell the friends with whom I have been conversing so often and so long for the last thing ere for a little while I bid them good-bye ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8542 len. 55]: And Ethelwyn bends her smooth forehead -- for she has a smooth forehead still , although the hair that crowns it is almost white -- over the last few sheets ; and while she reads , I will tell those who will read , one of the good things that come of being married .
Parsing [sent. 8543 len. 45]: It is , that there is one face upon which the changes come without your seeing them ; or rather , there is one face which you can still see the same through all the shadows which years have gathered and heaped upon it .
Parsing [sent. 8544 len. 114]: No , stay ; I have got a better way of putting it still : there is one face whose final beauty you can see the mere clearly as the bloom of youth departs , and the loveliness of wisdom and the beauty of holiness take its place ; for in it you behold all that you loved before , veiled , it is true , but glowing with gathered brilliance under the veil -LRB- `` Stop one moment , my dear '' -RRB- from which it will one day shine out like the moon from under a cloud , when a stream of the upper air floats it from off her face .
Parsing [sent. 8545 len. 9]: `` Now , Ethelwyn , I am ready .
Parsing [sent. 8546 len. 8]: What shall I write about next ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8547 len. 14]: `` I do n't think you have told them anywhere about Tom . ''
Parsing [sent. 8548 len. 6]: `` No more I have .
Parsing [sent. 8549 len. 6]: I meant to do so .
Parsing [sent. 8550 len. 8]: But I am ashamed of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 8551 len. 9]: `` The more reason to tell it . ''
Parsing [sent. 8552 len. 6]: `` You are quite right .
Parsing [sent. 8553 len. 9]: I will go on with it at once .
Parsing [sent. 8554 len. 9]: But you must not stand there behind me .
Parsing [sent. 8555 len. 21]: When I was a child , I could always confess best when I hid my face with my hands . ''
Parsing [sent. 8556 len. 41]: `` Besides , '' said Ethelwyn , without seeming to hear what I said , `` I do not want to have people saying that the vicar has made himself out so good that nobody can believe in him . ''
Parsing [sent. 8557 len. 13]: `` That would be a great fault in my book , Ethelwyn .
Parsing [sent. 8558 len. 8]: What does it come from in me ?
Parsing [sent. 8559 len. 4]: Let me see .
Parsing [sent. 8560 len. 32]: I do not think I want to appear better than I am ; but it sounds hypocritical to make merely general confessions , and it is indecorous to make particular ones .
Parsing [sent. 8561 len. 37]: Besides , I doubt if it is good to write much about bad things even in the way of confession -- '' `` Well , well , never mind justifying it , '' said Ethelwyn . ''
Parsing [sent. 8562 len. 9]: _ I _ do n't want any justification .
Parsing [sent. 8563 len. 8]: But here is a chance for you .
Parsing [sent. 8564 len. 14]: The story will , I think , do good , and not harm .
Parsing [sent. 8565 len. 10]: You had better tell it , I do think .
Parsing [sent. 8566 len. 21]: So if you are inclined , I will go away at once , and let you go on without interruption .
Parsing [sent. 8567 len. 24]: You will have it finished before dinner , and Tom is coming , and you can tell him what you have done . ''
Parsing [sent. 8568 len. 15]: So , reader , now my wife has left me , I will begin .
Parsing [sent. 8569 len. 8]: It shall not be a long story .
Parsing [sent. 8570 len. 43]: As soon as my wife and I had settled down at home , and I had begun to arrange my work again , it came to my mind that for a long time I had been doing very little for Tom Weir .
Parsing [sent. 8571 len. 43]: I could not blame myself much for this , and I was pretty sure neither he nor his father blamed me at all ; but I now saw that it was time we should recommence something definite in the way of study .
Parsing [sent. 8572 len. 54]: When he came to my house the next morning , and I proceeded to acquaint myself with what he had been doing , I found to my great pleasure that he had made very considerable progress both in Latin and Mathematics , and I resolved that I would now push him a little .
Parsing [sent. 8573 len. 22]: I found this only brought out his mettle ; and his progress , as it seemed to me , was extraordinary .
Parsing [sent. 8574 len. 5]: Nor was this all .
Parsing [sent. 8575 len. 60]: There were such growing signs of goodness in addition to the uprightness which had first led to our acquaintance , that although I carefully abstained from making the suggestion to him , I was more than pleased when I discovered , from some remark he made , that he would gladly give himself to the service of the Church .
Parsing [sent. 8576 len. 55]: At the same time I felt compelled to be the more cautious in anything I said , from the fact that the prospect of the social elevation which would be involved in the change might be a temptation to him , as no doubt it has been to many a man of humble birth .
Parsing [sent. 8577 len. 68]: However , as I continued to observe him closely , my conviction was deepened that he was rarely fitted for ministering to his fellows ; and soon it came to speech between his father and me , when I found that Thomas , so far from being unfavourably inclined to the proposal , was prepared to spend the few savings of his careful life upon his education .
Parsing [sent. 8578 len. 39]: To this , however , I could not listen , because there was his daughter Mary , who was very delicate , and his grandchild too , for whom he ought to make what little provision he could .
Parsing [sent. 8579 len. 56]: I therefore took the matter in my own hands , and by means of a judicious combination of experience and what money I could spare , I managed , at less expense than most parents suppose to be unavoidable , to maintain my young friend at Oxford till such time as he gained a fellowship .
Parsing [sent. 8580 len. 103]: I felt justified in doing so in part from the fact that some day or other Mrs Walton would inherit the Oldcastle property , as well as come into possession of certain moneys of her own , now in the trust of her mother and two gentlemen in London , which would be nearly sufficient to free the estate from incumbrance , although she could not touch it as long as her mother lived and chose to refuse her the use of it , at least without a law-suit , with which neither of us was inclined to have anything to do .
Parsing [sent. 8581 len. 11]: But I did not lose a penny by the affair .
Parsing [sent. 8582 len. 40]: For of the very first money Tom received after he had got his fellowship , he brought the half to me , and continued to do so until he had repaid me every shilling I had spent upon him .
Parsing [sent. 8583 len. 31]: As soon as he was in deacon 's orders , he came to assist me for a while as curate , and I found him a great help and comfort .
Parsing [sent. 8584 len. 25]: He occupied the large room over his father 's shop which had been his grandfather 's : he had been dead for some years .
Parsing [sent. 8585 len. 101]: I was now engaged on a work which I had been contemplating for a long time , upon the development of the love of Nature as shown in the earlier literature of the Jews and Greeks , through that of the Romans , Italians , and other nations , with the Anglo-Saxon for a fresh starting-point , into its latest forms in Gray , Thomson , Cowper , Crabbe , Wordsworth , Keats , and Tennyson ; and Tom supplied me with much of the time which I bestowed upon this object , and I was really grateful to him .
Parsing [sent. 8586 len. 54]: But , in looking back , and trying to account to myself for the snare into which I fell , I see plainly enough that I thought too much of what I had done for Tom , and too little of the honour God had done me in allowing me to help Tom .
Parsing [sent. 8587 len. 69]: I took the high-dais-throne over him , not consciously , I believe , but still with a contemptible condescension , not of manner but of heart , so delicately refined by the innate sophistry of my selfishness , that the better nature in me called it only fatherly friendship , and did not recognize it as that abominable thing so favoured of all those that especially worship themselves .
Parsing [sent. 8588 len. 10]: But I abuse my fault instead of confessing it .
Parsing [sent. 8589 len. 15]: One evening , a gentle tap came to my door , and Tom entered .
Parsing [sent. 8590 len. 20]: He looked pale and anxious , and there was an uncertainty about his motions which I could not understand .
Parsing [sent. 8591 len. 9]: `` What is the matter , Tom ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8592 len. 3]: I asked .
Parsing [sent. 8593 len. 15]: `` I wanted to say something to you , sir , '' answered Tom .
Parsing [sent. 8594 len. 10]: `` Say on , '' I returned , cheerily .
Parsing [sent. 8595 len. 20]: `` It is not so easy to say , sir , '' rejoined Tom , with a faint smile .
Parsing [sent. 8596 len. 14]: `` Miss Walton , sir -- '' `` Well , what of her ?
Parsing [sent. 8597 len. 7]: There 's nothing happened to her ?
Parsing [sent. 8598 len. 32]: She was here a few minutes ago -- though , now I think of it -- '' Here a suspicion of the truth flashed on me , and struck me dumb .
Parsing [sent. 8599 len. 39]: I am now covered with shame to think how , when the thing approached myself on that side , it swept away for the moment all my fine theories about the equality of men in Christ their Head .
Parsing [sent. 8600 len. 29]: How could Tom Weir , whose father was a joiner , who had been a lad in a London shop himself , dare to propose marrying my sister ?
Parsing [sent. 8601 len. 28]: Instead of thinking of what he really was , my regard rested upon this and that stage through which he had passed to reach his present condition .
Parsing [sent. 8602 len. 16]: In fact , I regarded him rather as of my making than of God 's .
Parsing [sent. 8603 len. 40]: Perhaps it might do something to modify the scorn of all classes for those beneath them , to consider that , by regarding others thus , they justify those above them in looking down upon them in their turn .
Parsing [sent. 8604 len. 42]: In London shops , I am credibly informed , the young women who serve in the show-rooms , or behind the counters , are called LADIES , and talk of the girls who make up the articles for sale as PERSONS .
Parsing [sent. 8605 len. 60]: To the learned professions , however , the distinction between the shopwomen and milliners is , from their superior height , unrecognizable ; while doctors and lawyers are again , I doubt not , massed by countesses and other blue-blooded realities , with the literary lions who roar at soirees and kettle-drums , or even with chiropodists and violin-players !
Parsing [sent. 8606 len. 17]: But I am growing scornful at scorn , and forget that I too have been scornful .
Parsing [sent. 8607 len. 20]: Brothers , sisters , all good men and true women , let the Master seat us where He will .
Parsing [sent. 8608 len. 31]: Until he says , `` Come up higher , '' let us sit at the foot of the board , or stand behind , honoured in waiting upon His guests .
Parsing [sent. 8609 len. 25]: All that kind of thing is worth nothing in the kingdom ; and nothing will be remembered of us but the Master 's judgment .
Parsing [sent. 8610 len. 41]: I have known a good churchwoman who would be sweet as a sister to the abject poor , but offensively condescending to a shopkeeper or a dissenter , exactly as if he was a Pariah , and she a Brahmin .
Parsing [sent. 8611 len. 35]: I have known good people who were noble and generous towards their so-called inferiors and full of the rights of the race -- until it touched their own family , and just no longer .
Parsing [sent. 8612 len. 34]: Yea I , who had talked like this for years , at once , when Tom Weir wanted to marry my sister , lost my faith in the broad lines of human distinction .
Parsing [sent. 8613 len. 18]: judged according to appearances in which I did not even believe , and judged not righteous judgment .
Parsing [sent. 8614 len. 26]: `` For , '' reasoned the world in me , `` is it not too bad to drag your wife in for such an alliance ?
Parsing [sent. 8615 len. 8]: Has she not lowered herself enough already ?
Parsing [sent. 8616 len. 12]: Has she not married far below her accredited position in society ?
Parsing [sent. 8617 len. 20]: Will she not feel injured by your family if she see it capable of forming such a connexion ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8618 len. 10]: What answer I returned to Tom I hardly know .
Parsing [sent. 8619 len. 21]: I remember that the poor fellow 's face fell , and that he murmured something which I did not heed .
Parsing [sent. 8620 len. 30]: And then I found myself walking in the garden under the great cedar , having stepped out of the window almost unconsciously , and left Tom standing there alone .
Parsing [sent. 8621 len. 11]: It was very good of him ever to forgive me .
Parsing [sent. 8622 len. 26]: Wandering about in the garden , my wife saw me from her window , and met me as I turned a corner in the shrubbery .
Parsing [sent. 8623 len. 34]: And now I am going to have my revenge upon her in a way she does not expect , for making me tell the story : I will tell her share in it .
Parsing [sent. 8624 len. 11]: `` What is the matter with you , Henry ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8625 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 8626 len. 10]: `` Oh , not much , '' I answered .
Parsing [sent. 8627 len. 12]: `` Only that Weir has been making me rather uncomfortable . ''
Parsing [sent. 8628 len. 8]: `` What has he been doing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8629 len. 7]: she inquired , in some alarm .
Parsing [sent. 8630 len. 12]: `` It is not possible he has done anything wrong . ''
Parsing [sent. 8631 len. 10]: My wife trusted him as much as I did .
Parsing [sent. 8632 len. 11]: `` No -- o -- o , '' I answered .
Parsing [sent. 8633 len. 7]: `` Not anything exactly wrong . ''
Parsing [sent. 8634 len. 18]: `` It must be very nearly wrong , Henry , to make you look so miserable . ''
Parsing [sent. 8635 len. 9]: I began to feel ashamed and more uncomfortable .
Parsing [sent. 8636 len. 39]: `` He has been falling in love with Martha , '' I said ; `` and when I put one thing to another , I fear he may have made her fall in love with him too . ''
Parsing [sent. 8637 len. 5]: My wife laughed merrily .
Parsing [sent. 8638 len. 7]: `` Whal a wicked curate ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8639 len. 13]: `` Well , but you know it is not exactly agreeable . ''
Parsing [sent. 8640 len. 4]: `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8641 len. 8]: `` You know why well enough . ''
Parsing [sent. 8642 len. 14]: `` At least , I am not going to take it for granted .
Parsing [sent. 8643 len. 8]: Is he not a good man ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8644 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 8645 len. 9]: `` Is he not a well-educated man ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8646 len. 11]: `` As well as myself -- for his years . ''
Parsing [sent. 8647 len. 7]: `` Is he not clever ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8648 len. 18]: `` One of the cleverest fellows I ever met '' `` Is he not a gentleman ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8649 len. 13]: `` I have not a fault to find with his manners . ''
Parsing [sent. 8650 len. 7]: `` Nor with his habits ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8651 len. 5]: my wife went on .
Parsing [sent. 8652 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 8653 len. 9]: `` Nor with his ways of thinking ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8654 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 8655 len. 13]: -- But , Ethelwyn , you know what I mean quite well .
Parsing [sent. 8656 len. 7]: His family , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 8657 len. 12]: `` Well , is his father not a respectable man ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8658 len. 7]: `` Oh , yes , certainly .
Parsing [sent. 8659 len. 4]: Thoroughly respectable . ''
Parsing [sent. 8660 len. 20]: `` He would n't borrow money of his tailor instead of paying for his clothes , would he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8661 len. 23]: `` Certainly not '' `` And if he were to die to-day he would carry no debts to heaven with him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8662 len. 6]: `` I believe not . ''
Parsing [sent. 8663 len. 11]: `` Does he bear false witness against his neighbour ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8664 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 8665 len. 14]: He scorns a lie as much as any man I ever knew . ''
Parsing [sent. 8666 len. 16]: `` Which of the commandments is it in particular that he breaks , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8667 len. 20]: `` None that I know of ; excepting that no one can keep them yet that is only human .
Parsing [sent. 8668 len. 13]: He tries to keep every one of them I do believe . ''
Parsing [sent. 8669 len. 14]: `` Well , I think Tom very fortunate in having such a father .
Parsing [sent. 8670 len. 10]: I wish my mother had been as good . ''
Parsing [sent. 8671 len. 48]: `` That is all true , and yet -- '' `` And yet , suppose a young man you liked had had a fashionable father who had ruined half a score of trades-people by his extravagance -- would you object to him because of his family ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8672 len. 5]: `` Perhaps not . ''
Parsing [sent. 8673 len. 17]: `` Then , with you , position outweighs honesty -- in fathers , at least . ''
Parsing [sent. 8674 len. 16]: To this I was not ready with an answer , and my wife went on .
Parsing [sent. 8675 len. 21]: `` It might be reasonable if you did though , from fear lest he should turn out like his father .
Parsing [sent. 8676 len. 25]: -- But do you know why I would not accept your offer of taking my name when I should succeed to the property ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8677 len. 12]: `` You said you liked mine better , '' I answered .
Parsing [sent. 8678 len. 5]: `` So I did .
Parsing [sent. 8679 len. 54]: But I did not tell you that I was ashamed that my good husband should take a name which for centuries had been borne by hard-hearted , worldly minded people , who , to speak the truth of my ancestors to my husband , were neither gentle nor honest , nor high-minded . ''
Parsing [sent. 8680 len. 23]: `` Still , Ethelwyn , you know there is something in it , though it is not so easy to say what .
Parsing [sent. 8681 len. 5]: And you avoid that .
Parsing [sent. 8682 len. 13]: I suppose Martha has been talking you over to her side . ''
Parsing [sent. 8683 len. 26]: `` Harry , '' my wife said , with a shade of solemnity , `` I am almost ashamed of you for the first time .
Parsing [sent. 8684 len. 11]: And I will punish you by telling you the truth .
Parsing [sent. 8685 len. 34]: Do you think I had nothing of that sort to get over when I began to find that I was thinking a little more about you than was quite convenient under the circumstances ?
Parsing [sent. 8686 len. 21]: Your manners , dear Harry , though irreproachable , just had not the tone that I had been accustomed to .
Parsing [sent. 8687 len. 19]: There was a diffidence about you also that did not at first advance you in my regard . ''
Parsing [sent. 8688 len. 18]: `` Yes , yes , '' I answered , a little piqued , `` I dare say .
Parsing [sent. 8689 len. 11]: I have no doubt you thought me a boor . ''
Parsing [sent. 8690 len. 5]: `` Dear Harry ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8691 len. 8]: `` I beg your pardon , wifie .
Parsing [sent. 8692 len. 6]: I know you did n't .
Parsing [sent. 8693 len. 22]: But it is quite bad enough to have brought you down to my level , without sinking you still lower . ''
Parsing [sent. 8694 len. 9]: `` Now there you are wrong , Harry .
Parsing [sent. 8695 len. 10]: And that is what I want to show you .
Parsing [sent. 8696 len. 19]: I found that my love to you would not be satisfied with making an exception in your favour .
Parsing [sent. 8697 len. 18]: I must see what force there really was in the notions I had been bred in . ''
Parsing [sent. 8698 len. 4]: `` Ah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8699 len. 3]: I said .
Parsing [sent. 8700 len. 4]: `` I see .
Parsing [sent. 8701 len. 15]: You looked for a principle in what you had thought was an exception . ''
Parsing [sent. 8702 len. 15]: `` Yes , '' returned my wife ; `` and I soon found one .
Parsing [sent. 8703 len. 17]: And the next step was to throw away all false judgment in regard to such things .
Parsing [sent. 8704 len. 16]: And so I can see more clearly than you into the right of the matter .
Parsing [sent. 8705 len. 20]: -- Would you hesitate a moment between Tom Weir and the dissolute son of an earl , Harry ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8706 len. 8]: `` You know I would not . ''
Parsing [sent. 8707 len. 63]: `` Well , just carry out the considerations that suggests , and you will find that where there is everything personally noble , pure , simple , and good , the lowliness of a man 's birth is but an added honour to him ; for it shows that his nobility is altogether from within him , and therefore is his own .
Parsing [sent. 8708 len. 45]: It can not then have been put on him by education or imitation , as many men 's manners are , who wear their good breeding like their fine clothes , or as the Pharisee his prayers , to be seen of men . ''
Parsing [sent. 8709 len. 6]: `` But his sister ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8710 len. 5]: `` Harry , Harry !
Parsing [sent. 8711 len. 13]: You were preaching last Sunday about the way God thinks of things .
Parsing [sent. 8712 len. 14]: And you said that was the only true way of thinking about them .
Parsing [sent. 8713 len. 33]: Would the Mary that poured the ointment on Jesus 's head have refused to marry a good man because he was the brother of that Mary who poured it on His feet ?
Parsing [sent. 8714 len. 16]: Have you thought what God would think of Tom for a husband to Martha ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8715 len. 12]: I did not answer , for conscience had begun to speak .
Parsing [sent. 8716 len. 19]: When I lifted my eyes from the ground , thinking Ethelwyn stood beside me , she was gone .
Parsing [sent. 8717 len. 15]: I felt as if she were dead , to punish me for my pride .
Parsing [sent. 8718 len. 19]: But still I could not get over it , though I was ashamed to follow and find her .
Parsing [sent. 8719 len. 12]: I went and got my hat instead , and strolled out .
Parsing [sent. 8720 len. 12]: What was it that drew me towards Thomas Weir 's shop ?
Parsing [sent. 8721 len. 18]: I think it must have been incipient repentance -- a feeling that I had wronged the man .
Parsing [sent. 8722 len. 37]: But just as I turned the corner , and the smell of the wood reached me , the picture so often associated in my mind with such a scene of human labour , rose before me .
Parsing [sent. 8723 len. 21]: I saw the Lord of Life bending over His bench , fashioning some lowly utensil for some housewife of Nazareth .
Parsing [sent. 8724 len. 28]: And He would receive payment for it too ; for He at least could see no disgrace in the order of things that His Father had appointed .
Parsing [sent. 8725 len. 18]: It is the vulgar mind that looks down on the earning and worships the inheriting of money .
Parsing [sent. 8726 len. 45]: How infinitely more poetic is the belief that our Lord did His work like any other honest man , than that straining after His glorification in the early centuries of the Church by the invention of fables even to the disgrace of his father !
Parsing [sent. 8727 len. 27]: They say that Joseph was a bad carpenter , and our Lord had to work miracles to set the things right which he had made wrong !
Parsing [sent. 8728 len. 35]: To such a class of mind as invented these fables do those belong who think they honour our Lord when they judge anything human too common or too unclean for Him to have done .
Parsing [sent. 8729 len. 61]: And the thought sprung up at once in my mind -- `` If I ever see our Lord face to face , how shall I feel if He says to me ; ` Didst thou do well to murmur that thy sister espoused a certain man for that in his youth he had earned his bread as I earned mine ?
Parsing [sent. 8730 len. 16]: Where was then thy right to say unto me , Lord , Lord ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 8731 len. 6]: I hurried into the workshop .
Parsing [sent. 8732 len. 9]: `` Has Tom told you about it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8733 len. 3]: I said .
Parsing [sent. 8734 len. 5]: `` Yes , sir .
Parsing [sent. 8735 len. 25]: And I told him to mind what he was about ; for he was not a gentleman , and you was , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 8736 len. 6]: `` I hope I am .
Parsing [sent. 8737 len. 16]: And Tom is as much a gentleman as I have any claim to be . ''
Parsing [sent. 8738 len. 7]: Thomas Weir held out his hand .
Parsing [sent. 8739 len. 31]: `` Now , sir , I do believe you mean in my shop what you say in your pulpit ; and there is ONE Christian in the world at least .
Parsing [sent. 8740 len. 9]: -- But what will your good lady say ?
Parsing [sent. 8741 len. 12]: She 's higher-born than you -- no offence , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 8742 len. 9]: `` Ah , Thomas , you shame me .
Parsing [sent. 8743 len. 10]: I am not so good as you think me .
Parsing [sent. 8744 len. 13]: It was my wife that brought me to reason about it . ''
Parsing [sent. 8745 len. 6]: `` God bless her . ''
Parsing [sent. 8746 len. 3]: `` Amen .
Parsing [sent. 8747 len. 8]: I 'm going to find Tom . ''
Parsing [sent. 8748 len. 15]: At the same moment Tom entered the shop , with a very melancholy face .
Parsing [sent. 8749 len. 11]: He started when he saw me , and looked confused .
Parsing [sent. 8750 len. 18]: `` Tom , my boy , '' I said , `` I behaved very badly to you .
Parsing [sent. 8751 len. 6]: I am sorry for it .
Parsing [sent. 8752 len. 13]: Come back with me , and have a walk with my sister .
Parsing [sent. 8753 len. 13]: I do n't think she 'll be sorry to see you . ''
Parsing [sent. 8754 len. 14]: His face brightened up at once , and we left the shop together .
Parsing [sent. 8755 len. 12]: Evidently with a great effort Tom was the first to speak .
Parsing [sent. 8756 len. 17]: `` I know , sir , how many difficulties my presumption must put you in . ''
Parsing [sent. 8757 len. 9]: `` Not another word about it , Tom .
Parsing [sent. 8758 len. 4]: You are blameless .
Parsing [sent. 8759 len. 5]: I wish I were .
Parsing [sent. 8760 len. 27]: If we only act as God would have us , other considerations may look after themselves -- or , rather , He will look after them .
Parsing [sent. 8761 len. 27]: The world will never be right till the mind of God is the measure of things , and the will of God the law of things .
Parsing [sent. 8762 len. 10]: In the kingdom of Heaven nothing else is acknowledged .
Parsing [sent. 8763 len. 34]: And till that kingdom come , the mind and will of God must , with those that look for that kingdom , over-ride every other way of thinking , feeling , and judging .
Parsing [sent. 8764 len. 10]: I see it more plainly than ever I did .
Parsing [sent. 8765 len. 18]: Take my sister , in God 's name , Tom , and be good to her . ''
Parsing [sent. 8766 len. 12]: Tom went to find Martha , and I to find Ethelwyn .
Parsing [sent. 8767 len. 24]: `` It is all right , '' I said , `` even to the shame I feel at having needed your reproof . ''
Parsing [sent. 8768 len. 7]: `` Do n't think of that .
Parsing [sent. 8769 len. 20]: God gives us all time to come to our right minds , you know , '' answered my wife .
Parsing [sent. 8770 len. 16]: `` But how did you get on so far a-head of me , wifie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8771 len. 3]: Ethelwyn laughed .
Parsing [sent. 8772 len. 29]: `` Why , '' she said , `` I only told you back again what you have been telling me for the last seven or eight years . ''
Parsing [sent. 8773 len. 19]: So to me the message had come first , but my wife had answered first with the deed .
Parsing [sent. 8774 len. 10]: And now I have had my revenge on her .
Parsing [sent. 8775 len. 17]: Next to her and my children , Tom has been my greatest comfort for many years .
Parsing [sent. 8776 len. 22]: He is still my curate , and I do not think we shall part till death part us for a time .
Parsing [sent. 8777 len. 16]: My sister is worth twice what she was before , though they have no children .
Parsing [sent. 8778 len. 11]: We have many , and they have taught me much .
Parsing [sent. 8779 len. 11]: Thomas Weir is now too old to work any longer .
Parsing [sent. 8780 len. 15]: He occupies his father 's chair in the large room of the old house .
Parsing [sent. 8781 len. 68]: The workshop I have had turned into a school-room , of the external condition of which his daughter takes good care , while a great part of her brother Tom 's time is devoted to the children ; for he and I agree that , where it can be done , the pastoral care ought to be at least equally divided between the sheep and the lambs .
Parsing [sent. 8782 len. 65]: For the sooner the children are brought under right influences -- I do not mean a great deal of religious speech , but the right influences of truth and honesty , and an evident regard to what God wants of us -- not only are they the more easily wrought upon , but the sooner do they recognize those influences as right and good .
Parsing [sent. 8783 len. 60]: And while Tom quite agrees with me that there must not be much talk about religion , he thinks that there must be just the more acting upon religion ; and that if it be everywhere at hand in all things taught and done , it will be ready to show itself to every one who looks for it .
Parsing [sent. 8784 len. 38]: And besides that action is more powerful than speech in the inculcation of religion , Tom says there is no such corrective of sectarianism of every kind as the repression of speech and the encouragement of action .
Parsing [sent. 8785 len. 37]: Besides being a great help to me and everybody else almost in Marshmallows , Tom has distinguished himself in the literary world j and when I read his books I am yet prouder of my brother-in-law .
Parsing [sent. 8786 len. 13]: I am only afraid that Martha is not good enough for him .
Parsing [sent. 8787 len. 11]: But she certainly improves , as I have said already .
Parsing [sent. 8788 len. 15]: Jane Rogers was married to young Brownrigg about a year after we were married .
Parsing [sent. 8789 len. 30]: The old man is all but confined to the chimney-corner now , and Richard manages the farm , though not quite to his father 's satisfaction , of course .
Parsing [sent. 8790 len. 7]: But they are doing well notwithstanding .
Parsing [sent. 8791 len. 36]: The old mill has been superseded by one of new and rare device , built by Richard ; but the old cottage where his wife 's parents lived has slowly mouldered back to the dust .
Parsing [sent. 8792 len. 11]: For the old people have been dead for many years .
Parsing [sent. 8793 len. 55]: Often in the summer days as I go to or come from the vestry , I sit down for a moment on the turf that covers my old friend , and think that every day is mouldering away this body of mine till it shall fall a heap of dust into its appointed place .
Parsing [sent. 8794 len. 7]: But what is that to me ?
Parsing [sent. 8795 len. 56]: It is to me the drawing nigh of the fresh morning of life , when I shall be young and strong again , glad in the presence of the wise and beloved dead , and unspeakably glad in the presence of my God , which I have now but hope to possess far more hereafter .
Parsing [sent. 8796 len. 13]: I will not take a solemn leave of my friends iust yet .

Parsing [sent. 8798 len. 62]: I know that my mental faculty is growing weaker , but some power yet remains ; and I say to myself , `` Perhaps this is the final trial of your faith -- to trust in God to take care of your intellect for you , and to believe , in weakness , the truths He revealed to you in strength .
Parsing [sent. 8799 len. 23]: Remember that Truth depends not upon your seeing it , and believe as you saw when your sight was at its best .
Parsing [sent. 8800 len. 15]: For then you saw that the Truth was beyond all you could see . ''
Parsing [sent. 8801 len. 22]: Thus I try to prepare for dark days that may come , but which can not come without God in them .
Parsing [sent. 8802 len. 42]: And meantime I hope to be able to communicate some more of the good things experience and thought have taught me , and it may be some more of the events that have befallen my friends and myself in our pilgrimage .
Parsing [sent. 8803 len. 10]: So , kind readers , God be with you .
Parsing [sent. 8804 len. 10]: That is the older and better form of GOOD-BYE .
