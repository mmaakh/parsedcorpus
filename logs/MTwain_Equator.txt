Parsing [sent. 1 len. 57]: FOLLOWING THE EQUATOR A JOURNEY AROUND THE WORLD BY MARK TWAIN SAMUEL L. CLEMENS HARTFORD , CONNECTICUT THIS BOOK Is affectionately inscribed to MY YOUNG FRIEND HARRY ROGERS WITH RECOGNITION OF WHAT HE IS , AND APPREHENSION OF WHAT HE MAY BECOME UNLESS HE FORM HIMSELF A LITTLE MORE CLOSELY UPON THE MODEL OF THE AUTHOR .
Parsing [sent. 2 len. 6]: THE PUDD ` NHEAD MAXIMS .
Parsing [sent. 3 len. 13]: THESE WISDOMS ARE FOR THE LURING OF YOUTH TOWARD HIGH MORAL ALTITUDES .
Parsing [sent. 4 len. 13]: THE AUTHOR DID NOT GATHER THEM FROM PRACTICE , BUT FROM OBSERVATION .
Parsing [sent. 5 len. 20]: TO BE GOOD IS NOBLE ; BUT TO SHOW OTHERS HOW TO BE GOOD IS NOBLER AND NO TROUBLE .
Parsing [sent. 6 len. 6]: FOLLOWING THE EQUATOR CHAPTER I .
Parsing [sent. 7 len. 11]: A man may have no bad habits and have worse .
Parsing [sent. 8 len. 9]: -- Pudd ` nhead Wilson 's New Calendar .
Parsing [sent. 9 len. 22]: The starting point of this lecturing-trip around the world was Paris , where we had been living a year or two .
Parsing [sent. 10 len. 11]: We sailed for America , and there made certain preparations .
Parsing [sent. 11 len. 6]: This took but little time .
Parsing [sent. 12 len. 11]: Two members of my family elected to go with me .
Parsing [sent. 13 len. 4]: Also a carbuncle .
Parsing [sent. 14 len. 11]: The dictionary says a carbuncle is a kind of jewel .
Parsing [sent. 15 len. 9]: Humor is out of place in a dictionary .
Parsing [sent. 16 len. 22]: We started westward from New York in midsummer , with Major Pond to manage the platform-business as far as the Pacific .
Parsing [sent. 17 len. 31]: It was warm work , all the way , and the last fortnight of it was suffocatingly smoky , for in Oregon and British Columbia the forest fires were raging .
Parsing [sent. 18 len. 22]: We had an added week of smoke at the seaboard , where we were obliged to wait awhile for our ship .
Parsing [sent. 19 len. 19]: She had been getting herself ashore in the smoke , and she had to be docked And repaired .
Parsing [sent. 20 len. 21]: We sailed at last ; and so ended a snail-paced march across the continent , which had lasted forty days .
Parsing [sent. 21 len. 52]: We moved westward about mid-afternoon over a rippled and sparkling summer sea ; an enticing sea , a clean and cool sea , and apparently a welcome sea to all on board ; it certainly was to me , after the distressful dustings and smokings and swelterings of the past weeks .
Parsing [sent. 22 len. 15]: The voyage would furnish a three-weeks holiday , with hardly a break in it .
Parsing [sent. 23 len. 22]: We had the whole Pacific Ocean in front of us , with nothing to do but do nothing and be comfortable .
Parsing [sent. 24 len. 38]: The city of Victoria was twinkling dim in the deep heart of her smoke-cloud , and getting ready to vanish and now we closed the field-glasses and sat down on our steamer chairs contented and at peace .
Parsing [sent. 25 len. 19]: But they went to wreck and ruin under us and brought us to shame before all the passengers .
Parsing [sent. 26 len. 33]: They had been furnished by the largest furniture-dealing house in Victoria , and were worth a couple of farthings a dozen , though they had cost us the price of honest chairs .
Parsing [sent. 27 len. 35]: In the Pacific and Indian Oceans one must still bring his own deck-chair on board or go without , just as in the old forgotten Atlantic times -- those Dark Ages of sea travel .
Parsing [sent. 28 len. 27]: Ours was a reasonably comfortable ship , with the customary sea-going fare -- plenty of good food furnished by the Deity and cooked by the devil .
Parsing [sent. 29 len. 20]: The discipline observable on board was perhaps as good as it is anywhere in the Pacific and Indian Oceans .
Parsing [sent. 30 len. 29]: The ship was not very well arranged for tropical service ; but that is nothing , for this is the rule for ships which ply in the tropics .
Parsing [sent. 31 len. 32]: She had an over-supply of cockroaches , but this is also the rule with ships doing business in the summer seas -- at least such as have been long in service .
Parsing [sent. 32 len. 27]: Our young captain was a very handsome man , tall and perfectly formed , the very figure to show up a smart uniform 's finest effects .
Parsing [sent. 33 len. 17]: He was a man of the best intentions and was polite and courteous even to courtliness .
Parsing [sent. 34 len. 27]: There was a soft grace and finish about his manners which made whatever place he happened to be in seem for the moment a drawing room .
Parsing [sent. 35 len. 6]: He avoided the smoking room .
Parsing [sent. 36 len. 5]: He had no vices .
Parsing [sent. 37 len. 57]: He did not smoke or chew tobacco or take snuff ; he did not swear , or use slang or rude , or coarse , or indelicate language , or make puns , or tell anecdotes , or laugh intemperately , or raise his voice above the moderate pitch enjoined by the canons of good form .
Parsing [sent. 38 len. 14]: When he gave an order , his manner modified it into a request .
Parsing [sent. 39 len. 32]: After dinner he and his officers joined the ladies and gentlemen in the ladies ' saloon , and shared in the singing and piano playing , and helped turn the music .
Parsing [sent. 40 len. 17]: He had a sweet and sympathetic tenor voice , and used it with taste and effect .
Parsing [sent. 41 len. 22]: After the music he played whist there , always with the same partner and opponents , until the ladies ' bedtime .
Parsing [sent. 42 len. 29]: The electric lights burned there as late as the ladies and their friends might desire ; but they were not allowed to burn in the smoking-room after eleven .
Parsing [sent. 43 len. 34]: There were many laws on the ship 's statute book of course ; but so far as I could see , this and one other were the only ones that were rigidly enforced .
Parsing [sent. 44 len. 26]: The captain explained that he enforced this one because his own cabin adjoined the smoking-room , and the smell of tobacco smoke made him sick .
Parsing [sent. 45 len. 53]: I did not see how our smoke could reach him , for the smoking-room and his cabin were on the upper deck , targets for all the winds that blew ; and besides there was no crack of communication between them , no opening of any sort in the solid intervening bulkhead .
Parsing [sent. 46 len. 13]: Still , to a delicate stomach even imaginary smoke can convey damage .
Parsing [sent. 47 len. 32]: The captain , with his gentle nature , his polish , his sweetness , his moral and verbal purity , seemed pathetically out of place in his rude and autocratic vocation .
Parsing [sent. 48 len. 10]: It seemed another instance of the irony of fate .
Parsing [sent. 49 len. 8]: He was going home under a cloud .
Parsing [sent. 50 len. 13]: The passengers knew about his trouble , and were sorry for him .
Parsing [sent. 51 len. 34]: Approaching Vancouver through a narrow and difficult passage densely befogged with smoke from the forest fires , he had had the ill-luck to lose his bearings and get his ship on the rocks .
Parsing [sent. 52 len. 27]: A matter like this would rank merely as an error with you and me ; it ranks as a crime with the directors of steamship companies .
Parsing [sent. 53 len. 21]: The captain had been tried by the Admiralty Court at Vancouver , and its verdict had acquitted him of blame .
Parsing [sent. 54 len. 6]: But that was insufficient comfort .
Parsing [sent. 55 len. 34]: A sterner court would examine the case in Sydney -- the Court of Directors , the lords of a company in whose ships the captain had served as mate a number of years .
Parsing [sent. 56 len. 8]: This was his first voyage as captain .
Parsing [sent. 57 len. 27]: The officers of our ship were hearty and companionable young men , and they entered into the general amusements and helped the passengers pass the time .
Parsing [sent. 58 len. 15]: Voyages in the Pacific and Indian Oceans are but pleasure excursions for all hands .
Parsing [sent. 59 len. 16]: Our purser was a young Scotchman who was equipped with a grit that was remarkable .
Parsing [sent. 60 len. 25]: He was an invalid , and looked it , as far as his body was concerned , but illness could not subdue his spirit .
Parsing [sent. 61 len. 14]: He was full of life , and had a gay and capable tongue .
Parsing [sent. 62 len. 55]: To all appearances he was a sick man without being aware of it , for he did not talk about his ailments , and his bearing and conduct were those of a person in robust health ; yet he was the prey , at intervals , of ghastly sieges of pain in his heart .
Parsing [sent. 63 len. 17]: These lasted many hours , and while the attack continued he could neither sit nor lie .
Parsing [sent. 64 len. 39]: In one instance he stood on his feet twenty-four hours fighting for his life with these sharp agonies , and yet was as full of life and cheer and activity the next day as if nothing had happened .
Parsing [sent. 65 len. 30]: The brightest passenger in the ship , and the most interesting and felicitous talker , was a young Canadian who was not able to let the whisky bottle alone .
Parsing [sent. 66 len. 53]: He was of a rich and powerful family , and could have had a distinguished career and abundance of effective help toward it if he could have conquered his appetite for drink ; but he could not do it , so his great equipment of talent was of no use to him .
Parsing [sent. 67 len. 39]: He had often taken the pledge to drink no more , and was a good sample of what that sort of unwisdom can do for a man -- for a man with anything short of an iron will .
Parsing [sent. 68 len. 62]: The system is wrong in two ways : it does not strike at the root of the trouble , for one thing , and to make a pledge of any kind is to declare war against nature ; for a pledge is a chain that is always clanking and reminding the wearer of it that he is not a free man .
Parsing [sent. 69 len. 23]: I have said that the system does not strike at the root of the trouble , and I venture to repeat that .
Parsing [sent. 70 len. 13]: The root is not the drinking , but the desire to drink .
Parsing [sent. 71 len. 6]: These are very different things .
Parsing [sent. 72 len. 33]: The one merely requires will -- and a great deal of it , both as to bulk and staying capacity -- the other merely requires watchfulness -- and for no long time .
Parsing [sent. 73 len. 59]: The desire of course precedes the act , and should have one 's first attention ; it can do but little good to refuse the act over and over again , always leaving the desire unmolested , unconquered ; the desire will continue to assert itself , and will be almost sure to win in the long run .
Parsing [sent. 74 len. 16]: When the desire intrudes , it should be at once banished out of the mind .
Parsing [sent. 75 len. 18]: One should be on the watch for it all the time -- otherwise it will get in .
Parsing [sent. 76 len. 14]: It must be taken in time and not allowed to get a lodgment .
Parsing [sent. 77 len. 12]: A desire constantly repulsed for a fortnight should die , then .
Parsing [sent. 78 len. 7]: That should cure the drinking habit .
Parsing [sent. 79 len. 28]: The system of refusing the mere act of drinking , and leaving the desire in full force , is unintelligent war tactics , it seems to me .
Parsing [sent. 80 len. 11]: I used to take pledges -- and soon violate them .
Parsing [sent. 81 len. 13]: My will was not strong , and I could not help it .
Parsing [sent. 82 len. 29]: And then , to be tied in any way naturally irks an otherwise free person and makes him chafe in his bonds and want to get his liberty .
Parsing [sent. 83 len. 46]: But when I finally ceased from taking definite pledges , and merely resolved that I would kill an injurious desire , but leave myself free to resume the desire and the habit whenever I should choose to do so , I had no more trouble .
Parsing [sent. 84 len. 31]: In five days I drove out the desire to smoke and was not obliged to keep watch after that ; and I never experienced any strong desire to smoke again .
Parsing [sent. 85 len. 30]: At the end of a year and a quarter of idleness I began to write a book , and presently found that the pen was strangely reluctant to go .
Parsing [sent. 86 len. 16]: I tried a smoke to see if that would help me out of the difficulty .
Parsing [sent. 87 len. 3]: It did .
Parsing [sent. 88 len. 39]: I smoked eight or ten cigars and as many pipes a day for five months ; finished the book , and did not smoke again until a year had gone by and another book had to be begun .
Parsing [sent. 89 len. 19]: I can quit any of my nineteen injurious habits at any time , and without discomfort or inconvenience .
Parsing [sent. 90 len. 45]: I think that the Dr. Tanners and those others who go forty days without eating do it by resolutely keeping out the desire to eat , in the beginning , and that after a few hours the desire is discouraged and comes no more .
Parsing [sent. 91 len. 11]: Once I tried my scheme in a large medical way .
Parsing [sent. 92 len. 12]: I had been confined to my bed several days with lumbago .
Parsing [sent. 93 len. 6]: My case refused to improve .
Parsing [sent. 94 len. 14]: Finally the doctor said , -- `` My remedies have no fair chance .
Parsing [sent. 95 len. 11]: Consider what they have to fight , besides the lumbago .
Parsing [sent. 96 len. 9]: You smoke extravagantly , do n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 97 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 98 len. 7]: `` You take coffee immoderately ? ''
Parsing [sent. 99 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 100 len. 6]: `` And some tea ? ''
Parsing [sent. 101 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 102 len. 17]: `` You eat all kinds of things that are dissatisfied with each other 's company ? ''
Parsing [sent. 103 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 104 len. 10]: `` You drink two hot Scotches every night ? ''
Parsing [sent. 105 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 106 len. 14]: `` Very well , there you see what I have to contend against .
Parsing [sent. 107 len. 11]: We ca n't make progress the way the matter stands .
Parsing [sent. 108 len. 23]: You must make a reduction in these things ; you must cut down your consumption of them considerably for some days . ''
Parsing [sent. 109 len. 8]: `` I ca n't , doctor . ''
Parsing [sent. 110 len. 7]: `` Why ca n't you . ''
Parsing [sent. 111 len. 6]: `` I lack the will-power .
Parsing [sent. 112 len. 16]: I can cut them off entirely , but I ca n't merely moderate them . ''
Parsing [sent. 113 len. 21]: He said that that would answer , and said he would come around in twenty-four hours and begin work again .
Parsing [sent. 114 len. 17]: He was taken ill himself and could not come ; but I did not need him .
Parsing [sent. 115 len. 47]: I cut off all those things for two days and nights ; in fact , I cut off all kinds of food , too , and all drinks except water , and at the end of the forty-eight hours the lumbago was discouraged and left me .
Parsing [sent. 116 len. 17]: I was a well man ; so I gave thanks and took to those delicacies again .
Parsing [sent. 117 len. 15]: It seemed a valuable medical course , and I recommended it to a lady .
Parsing [sent. 118 len. 27]: She had run down and down and down , and had at last reached a point where medicines no longer had any helpful effect upon her .
Parsing [sent. 119 len. 15]: I said I knew I could put her upon her feet in a week .
Parsing [sent. 120 len. 24]: It brightened her up , it filled her with hope , and she said she would do everything I told her to do .
Parsing [sent. 121 len. 27]: So I said she must stop swearing and drinking , and smoking and eating for four days , and then she would be all right again .
Parsing [sent. 122 len. 35]: And it would have happened just so , I know it ; but she said she could not stop swearing , and smoking , and drinking , because she had never done those things .
Parsing [sent. 123 len. 5]: So there it was .
Parsing [sent. 124 len. 11]: She had neglected her habits , and had n't any .
Parsing [sent. 125 len. 14]: Now that they would have come good , there were none in stock .
Parsing [sent. 126 len. 8]: She had nothing to fall back on .
Parsing [sent. 127 len. 19]: She was a sinking vessel , with no freight in her to throw overboard and lighten ship withal .
Parsing [sent. 128 len. 22]: Why , even one or two little bad habits could have saved her , but she was just a moral pauper .
Parsing [sent. 129 len. 33]: When she could have acquired them she was dissuaded by her parents , who were ignorant people though reared in the best society , and it was too late to begin now .
Parsing [sent. 130 len. 14]: It seemed such a pity ; but there was no help for it .
Parsing [sent. 131 len. 30]: These things ought to be attended to while a person is young ; otherwise , when age and disease come , there is nothing effectual to fight them with .
Parsing [sent. 132 len. 50]: When I was a youth I used to take all kinds of pledges , and do my best to keep them , but I never could , because I did n't strike at the root of the habit -- the desire ; I generally broke down within the month .
Parsing [sent. 133 len. 7]: Once I tried limiting a habit .
Parsing [sent. 134 len. 8]: That worked tolerably well for a while .
Parsing [sent. 135 len. 11]: I pledged myself to smoke but one cigar a day .
Parsing [sent. 136 len. 17]: I kept the cigar waiting until bedtime , then I had a luxurious time with it .
Parsing [sent. 137 len. 41]: But desire persecuted me every day and all day long ; so , within the week I found myself hunting for larger cigars than I had been used to smoke ; then larger ones still , and still larger ones .
Parsing [sent. 138 len. 17]: Within the fortnight I was getting cigars made for me -- on a yet larger pattern .
Parsing [sent. 139 len. 8]: They still grew and grew in size .
Parsing [sent. 140 len. 20]: Within the month my cigar had grown to such proportions that I could have used it as a crutch .
Parsing [sent. 141 len. 30]: It now seemed to me that a one-cigar limit was no real protection to a person , so I knocked my pledge on the head and resumed my liberty .
Parsing [sent. 142 len. 8]: To go back to that young Canadian .
Parsing [sent. 143 len. 19]: He was a `` remittance man , '' the first one I had ever seen or heard of .
Parsing [sent. 144 len. 7]: Passengers explained the term to me .
Parsing [sent. 145 len. 55]: They said that dissipated ne'er - do-weels belonging to important families in England and Canada were not cast off by their people while there was any hope of reforming them , but when that last hope perished at last , the ne'er - do-weel was sent abroad to get him out of the way .
Parsing [sent. 146 len. 43]: He was shipped off with just enough money in his pocket -- no , in the purser 's pocket -- for the needs of the voyage -- and when he reached his destined port he would find a remittance awaiting him there .
Parsing [sent. 147 len. 14]: Not a large one , but just enough to keep him a month .
Parsing [sent. 148 len. 8]: A similar remittance would come monthly thereafter .
Parsing [sent. 149 len. 55]: It was the remittance-man 's custom to pay his month 's board and lodging straightway -- a duty which his landlord did not allow him to forget -- then spree away the rest of his money in a single night , then brood and mope and grieve in idleness till the next remittance came .
Parsing [sent. 150 len. 6]: It is a pathetic life .
Parsing [sent. 151 len. 11]: We had other remittance-men on board , it was said .
Parsing [sent. 152 len. 10]: At least they said they were R. M. 's .
Parsing [sent. 153 len. 4]: There were two .
Parsing [sent. 154 len. 33]: But they did not resemble the Canadian ; they lacked his tidiness , and his brains , and his gentlemanly ways , and his resolute spirit , and his humanities and generosities .
Parsing [sent. 155 len. 32]: One of them was a lad of nineteen or twenty , and he was a good deal of a ruin , as to clothes , and morals , and general aspect .
Parsing [sent. 156 len. 41]: He said he was a scion of a ducal house in England , and had been shipped to Canada for the house 's relief , that he had fallen into trouble there , and was now being shipped to Australia .
Parsing [sent. 157 len. 7]: He said he had no title .
Parsing [sent. 158 len. 10]: Beyond this remark he was economical of the truth .
Parsing [sent. 159 len. 39]: The first thing he did in Australia was to get into the lockup , and the next thing he did was to proclaim himself an earl in the police court in the morning and fail to prove it .
Parsing [sent. 160 len. 3]: CHAPTER II .
Parsing [sent. 161 len. 8]: When in doubt , tell the truth .
Parsing [sent. 162 len. 9]: -- Pudd ` nhead Wilson 's New Calendar .
Parsing [sent. 163 len. 23]: About four days out from Victoria we plunged into hot weather , and all the male passengers put on white linen clothes .
Parsing [sent. 164 len. 38]: One or two days later we crossed the 25th parallel of north latitude , and then , by order , the officers of the ship laid away their blue uniforms and came out in white linen ones .
Parsing [sent. 165 len. 10]: All the ladies were in white by this time .
Parsing [sent. 166 len. 19]: This prevalence of snowy costumes gave the promenade deck an invitingly cool , and cheerful and picnicky aspect .
Parsing [sent. 167 len. 31]: From my diary : There are several sorts of ills in the world from which a person can never escape altogether , let him journey as far as he will .
Parsing [sent. 168 len. 16]: One escapes from one breed of an ill only to encounter another breed of it .
Parsing [sent. 169 len. 43]: We have come far from the snake liar and the fish liar , and there was rest and peace in the thought ; but now we have reached the realm of the boomerang liar , and sorrow is with us once more .
Parsing [sent. 170 len. 47]: The first officer has seen a man try to escape from his enemy by getting behind a tree ; but the enemy sent his boomerang sailing into the sky far above and beyond the tree ; then it turned , descended , and killed the man .
Parsing [sent. 171 len. 22]: The Australian passenger has seen this thing done to two men , behind two trees -- and by the one arrow .
Parsing [sent. 172 len. 39]: This being received with a large silence that suggested doubt , he buttressed it with the statement that his brother once saw the boomerang kill a bird away off a hundred yards and bring it to the thrower .
Parsing [sent. 173 len. 9]: But these are ills which must be borne .
Parsing [sent. 174 len. 6]: There is no other way .
Parsing [sent. 175 len. 26]: The talk passed from the boomerang to dreams -- usually a fruitful subject , afloat or ashore -- but this time the output was poor .
Parsing [sent. 176 len. 13]: Then it passed to instances of extraordinary memory -- with better results .
Parsing [sent. 177 len. 55]: Blind Tom , the negro pianist , was spoken of , and it was said that he could accurately play any piece of music , howsoever long and difficult , after hearing it once ; and that six months later he could accurately play it again , without having touched it in the interval .
Parsing [sent. 178 len. 26]: One of the most striking of the stories told was furnished by a gentleman who had served on the staff of the Viceroy of India .
Parsing [sent. 179 len. 57]: He read the details from his note-book , and explained that he had written them down , right after the consummation of the incident which they described , because he thought that if he did not put them down in black and white he might presently come to think he had dreamed them or invented them .
Parsing [sent. 180 len. 24]: The Viceroy was making a progress , and among the shows offered by the Maharajah of Mysore for his entertainment was a memory-exhibition .
Parsing [sent. 181 len. 34]: The Viceroy and thirty gentlemen of his suite sat in a row , and the memory-expert , a high-caste Brahmin , was brought in and seated on the floor in front of them .
Parsing [sent. 182 len. 31]: He said he knew but two languages , the English and his own , but would not exclude any foreign tongue from the tests to be applied to his memory .
Parsing [sent. 183 len. 14]: Then he laid before the assemblage his program -- a sufficiently extraordinary one .
Parsing [sent. 184 len. 24]: He proposed that one gentleman should give him one word of a foreign sentence , and tell him its place in the sentence .
Parsing [sent. 185 len. 24]: He was furnished with the French word ` est ' , and was told it was second in a sentence of three words .
Parsing [sent. 186 len. 24]: The next gentleman gave him the German word ` verloren ' and said it was the third in a sentence of four words .
Parsing [sent. 187 len. 39]: He asked the next gentleman for one detail in a sum in addition ; another for one detail in a sum of subtraction ; others for single details in mathematical problems of various kinds ; he got them .
Parsing [sent. 188 len. 31]: Intermediates gave him single words from sentences in Greek , Latin , Spanish , Portuguese , Italian , and other languages , and told him their places in the sentences .
Parsing [sent. 189 len. 56]: When at last everybody had furnished him a single rag from a foreign sentence or a figure from a problem , he went over the ground again , and got a second word and a second figure and was told their places in the sentences and the sums ; and so on and so on .
Parsing [sent. 190 len. 40]: He went over the ground again and again until he had collected all the parts of the sums and all the parts of the sentences -- and all in disorder , of course , not in their proper rotation .
Parsing [sent. 191 len. 6]: This had occupied two hours .
Parsing [sent. 192 len. 41]: The Brahmin now sat silent and thinking , a while , then began and repeated all the sentences , placing the words in their proper order , and untangled the disordered arithmetical problems and gave accurate answers to them all .
Parsing [sent. 193 len. 53]: In the beginning he had asked the company to throw almonds at him during the two hours , he to remember how many each gentleman had thrown ; but none were thrown , for the Viceroy said that the test would be a sufficiently severe strain without adding that burden to it .
Parsing [sent. 194 len. 34]: General Grant had a fine memory for all kinds of things , including even names and faces , and I could have furnished an instance of it if I had thought of it .
Parsing [sent. 195 len. 16]: The first time I ever saw him was early in his first term as President .
Parsing [sent. 196 len. 39]: I had just arrived in Washington from the Pacific coast , a stranger and wholly unknown to the public , and was passing the White House one morning when I met a friend , a Senator from Nevada .
Parsing [sent. 197 len. 12]: He asked me if I would like to see the President .
Parsing [sent. 198 len. 12]: I said I should be very glad ; so we entered .
Parsing [sent. 199 len. 39]: I supposed that the President would be in the midst of a crowd , and that I could look at him in peace and security from a distance , as another stray cat might look at another king .
Parsing [sent. 200 len. 36]: But it was in the morning , and the Senator was using a privilege of his office which I had not heard of -- the privilege of intruding upon the Chief Magistrate 's working hours .
Parsing [sent. 201 len. 23]: Before I knew it , the Senator and I were in the presence , and there was none there but we three .
Parsing [sent. 202 len. 43]: General Grant got slowly up from his table , put his pen down , and stood before me with the iron expression of a man who had not smiled for seven years , and was not intending to smile for another seven .
Parsing [sent. 203 len. 14]: He looked me steadily in the eyes -- mine lost confidence and fell .
Parsing [sent. 204 len. 20]: I had never confronted a great man before , and was in a miserable state of funk and inefficiency .
Parsing [sent. 205 len. 20]: The Senator said : -- `` Mr. President , may I have the privilege of introducing Mr. Clemens ? ''
Parsing [sent. 206 len. 12]: The President gave my hand an unsympathetic wag and dropped it .
Parsing [sent. 207 len. 10]: He did not say a word but just stood .
Parsing [sent. 208 len. 18]: In my trouble I could not think of anything to say , I merely wanted to resign .
Parsing [sent. 209 len. 14]: There was an awkward pause , a dreary pause , a horrible pause .
Parsing [sent. 210 len. 29]: Then I thought of something , and looked up into that unyielding face , and said timidly : -- `` Mr. President , I -- I am embarrassed .
Parsing [sent. 211 len. 4]: Are you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 212 len. 38]: His face broke -- just a little -- a wee glimmer , the momentary flicker of a summer-lightning smile , seven years ahead of time -- and I was out and gone as soon as it was .
Parsing [sent. 213 len. 12]: Ten years passed away before I saw him the second time .
Parsing [sent. 214 len. 45]: Meantime I was become better known ; and was one of the people appointed to respond to toasts at the banquet given to General Grant in Chicago -- by the Army of the Tennessee when he came back from his tour around the world .
Parsing [sent. 215 len. 13]: I arrived late at night and got up late in the morning .
Parsing [sent. 216 len. 34]: All the corridors of the hotel were crowded with people waiting to get a glimpse of General Grant when he should pass to the place whence he was to review the great procession .
Parsing [sent. 217 len. 36]: I worked my way by the suite of packed drawing-rooms , and at the corner of the house I found a window open where there was a roomy platform decorated with flags , and carpeted .
Parsing [sent. 218 len. 34]: I stepped out on it , and saw below me millions of people blocking all the streets , and other millions caked together in all the windows and on all the house-tops around .
Parsing [sent. 219 len. 31]: These masses took me for General Grant , and broke into volcanic explosions and cheers ; but it was a good place to see the procession , and I stayed .
Parsing [sent. 220 len. 54]: Presently I heard the distant blare of military music , and far up the street I saw the procession come in sight , cleaving its way through the huzzaing multitudes , with Sheridan , the most martial figure of the War , riding at its head in the dress uniform of a Lieutenant-General .
Parsing [sent. 221 len. 29]: And now General Grant , arm-in-arm with Major Carter Harrison , stepped out on the platform , followed two and two by the badged and uniformed reception committee .
Parsing [sent. 222 len. 24]: General Grant was looking exactly as he had looked upon that trying occasion of ten years before -- all iron and bronze self-possession .
Parsing [sent. 223 len. 15]: Mr. Harrison came over and led me to the General and formally introduced me .
Parsing [sent. 224 len. 22]: Before I could put together the proper remark , General Grant said -- `` Mr. Clemens , I am not embarrassed .
Parsing [sent. 225 len. 4]: Are you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 226 len. 12]: -- and that little seven-year smile twinkled across his face again .
Parsing [sent. 227 len. 107]: Seventeen years have gone by since then , and to-day , in New York , the streets are a crush of people who are there to honor the remains of the great soldier as they pass to their final resting-place under the monument ; and the air is heavy with dirges and the boom of artillery , and all the millions of America are thinking of the man who restored the Union and the flag , and gave to democratic government a new lease of life , and , as we may hope and do believe , a permanent place among the beneficent institutions of men .
Parsing [sent. 228 len. 37]: We had one game in the ship which was a good time-passer -- at least it was at night in the smoking-room when the men were getting freshened up from the day 's monotonies and dullnesses .
Parsing [sent. 229 len. 8]: It was the completing of non-complete stories .
Parsing [sent. 230 len. 32]: That is to say , a man would tell all of a story except the finish , then the others would try to supply the ending out of their own invention .
Parsing [sent. 231 len. 32]: When every one who wanted a chance had had it , the man who had introduced the story would give it its original ending -- then you could take your choice .
Parsing [sent. 232 len. 14]: Sometimes the new endings turned out to be better than the old one .
Parsing [sent. 233 len. 33]: But the story which called out the most persistent and determined and ambitious effort was one which had no ending , and so there was nothing to compare the new-made endings with .
Parsing [sent. 234 len. 30]: The man who told it said he could furnish the particulars up to a certain point only , because that was as much of the tale as he knew .
Parsing [sent. 235 len. 22]: He had read it in a volume of sketches twenty-five years ago , and was interrupted before the end was reached .
Parsing [sent. 236 len. 24]: He would give any one fifty dollars who would finish the story to the satisfaction of a jury to be appointed by ourselves .
Parsing [sent. 237 len. 10]: We appointed a jury and wrestled with the tale .
Parsing [sent. 238 len. 14]: We invented plenty of endings , but the jury voted them all down .
Parsing [sent. 239 len. 5]: The jury was right .
Parsing [sent. 240 len. 33]: It was a tale which the author of it may possibly have completed satisfactorily , and if he really had that good fortune I would like to know what the ending was .
Parsing [sent. 241 len. 37]: Any ordinary man will find that the story 's strength is in its middle , and that there is apparently no way to transfer it to the close , where of course it ought to be .
Parsing [sent. 242 len. 30]: In substance the storiette was as follows : John Brown , aged thirty-one , good , gentle , bashful , timid , lived in a quiet village in Missouri .
Parsing [sent. 243 len. 8]: He was superintendent of the Presbyterian Sunday-school .
Parsing [sent. 244 len. 33]: It was but a humble distinction ; still , it was his only official one , and he was modestly proud of it and was devoted to its work and its interests .
Parsing [sent. 245 len. 56]: The extreme kindliness of his nature was recognized by all ; in fact , people said that he was made entirely out of good impulses and bashfulness ; that he could always be counted upon for help when it was needed , and for bashfulness both when it was needed and when it was n't .
Parsing [sent. 246 len. 25]: Mary Taylor , twenty-three , modest , sweet , winning , and in character and person beautiful , was all in all to him .
Parsing [sent. 247 len. 11]: And he was very nearly all in all to her .
Parsing [sent. 248 len. 9]: She was wavering , his hopes were high .
Parsing [sent. 249 len. 10]: Her mother had been in opposition from the first .
Parsing [sent. 250 len. 12]: But she was wavering , too ; he could see it .
Parsing [sent. 251 len. 20]: She was being touched by his warm interest in her two charity-proteges and by his contributions toward their support .
Parsing [sent. 252 len. 29]: These were two forlorn and aged sisters who lived in a log hut in a lonely place up a cross road four miles from Mrs. Taylor 's farm .
Parsing [sent. 253 len. 17]: One of the sisters was crazy , and sometimes a little violent , but not often .
Parsing [sent. 254 len. 23]: At last the time seemed ripe for a final advance , and Brown gathered his courage together and resolved to make it .
Parsing [sent. 255 len. 34]: He would take along a contribution of double the usual size , and win the mother over ; with her opposition annulled , the rest of the conquest would be sure and prompt .
Parsing [sent. 256 len. 28]: He took to the road in the middle of a placid Sunday afternoon in the soft Missourian summer , and he was equipped properly for his mission .
Parsing [sent. 257 len. 24]: He was clothed all in white linen , with a blue ribbon for a necktie , and he had on dressy tight boots .
Parsing [sent. 258 len. 14]: His horse and buggy were the finest that the livery stable could furnish .
Parsing [sent. 259 len. 31]: The lap robe was of white linen , it was new , and it had a hand-worked border that could not be rivaled in that region for beauty and elaboration .
Parsing [sent. 260 len. 40]: When he was four miles out on the lonely road and was walking his horse over a wooden bridge , his straw hat blew off and fell in the creek , and floated down and lodged against a bar .
Parsing [sent. 261 len. 9]: He did not quite know what to do .
Parsing [sent. 262 len. 18]: He must have the hat , that was manifest ; but how was he to get it ?
Parsing [sent. 263 len. 6]: Then he had an idea .
Parsing [sent. 264 len. 9]: The roads were empty , nobody was stirring .
Parsing [sent. 265 len. 7]: Yes , he would risk it .
Parsing [sent. 266 len. 45]: He led the horse to the roadside and set it to cropping the grass ; then he undressed and put his clothes in the buggy , petted the horse a moment to secure its compassion and its loyalty , then hurried to the stream .
Parsing [sent. 267 len. 9]: He swam out and soon had the hat .
Parsing [sent. 268 len. 14]: When he got to the top of the bank the horse was gone !
Parsing [sent. 269 len. 8]: His legs almost gave way under him .
Parsing [sent. 270 len. 9]: The horse was walking leisurely along the road .
Parsing [sent. 271 len. 44]: Brown trotted after it , saying , `` Whoa , whoa , there 's a good fellow ; '' but whenever he got near enough to chance a jump for the buggy , the horse quickened its pace a little and defeated him .
Parsing [sent. 272 len. 24]: And so this went on , the naked man perishing with anxiety , and expecting every moment to see people come in sight .
Parsing [sent. 273 len. 45]: He tagged on and on , imploring the horse , beseeching the horse , till he had left a mile behind him , and was closing up on the Taylor premises ; then at last he was successful , and got into the buggy .
Parsing [sent. 274 len. 50]: He flung on his shirt , his necktie , and his coat ; then reached for -- but he was too late ; he sat suddenly down and pulled up the lap-robe , for he saw some one coming out of the gate -- a woman ; he thought .
Parsing [sent. 275 len. 15]: He wheeled the horse to the left , and struck briskly up the cross-road .
Parsing [sent. 276 len. 33]: It was perfectly straight , and exposed on both sides ; but there were woods and a sharp turn three miles ahead , and he was very grateful when he got there .
Parsing [sent. 277 len. 23]: As he passed around the turn he slowed down to a walk , and reached for his tr -- too late again .
Parsing [sent. 278 len. 16]: He had come upon Mrs. Enderby , Mrs. Glossop , Mrs. Taylor , and Mary .
Parsing [sent. 279 len. 11]: They were on foot , and seemed tired and excited .
Parsing [sent. 280 len. 38]: They came at once to the buggy and shook hands , and all spoke at once , and said eagerly and earnestly , how glad they were that he was come , and how fortunate it was .
Parsing [sent. 281 len. 42]: And Mrs. Enderby said , impressively : `` It looks like an accident , his coming at such a time ; but let no one profane it with such a name ; he was sent -- sent from on high . ''
Parsing [sent. 282 len. 28]: They were all moved , and Mrs. Glossop said in an awed voice : `` Sarah Enderby , you never said a truer word in your life .
Parsing [sent. 283 len. 11]: This is no accident , it is a special Providence .
Parsing [sent. 284 len. 4]: He was sent .
Parsing [sent. 285 len. 19]: He is an angel -- an angel as truly as ever angel was -- an angel of deliverance .
Parsing [sent. 286 len. 14]: I say angel , Sarah Enderby , and will have no other word .
Parsing [sent. 287 len. 37]: Do n't let any one ever say to me again , that there 's no such thing as special Providences ; for if this is n't one , let them account for it that can . ''
Parsing [sent. 288 len. 14]: `` I know it 's so , '' said Mrs. Taylor , fervently .
Parsing [sent. 289 len. 19]: `` John Brown , I could worship you ; I could go down on my knees to you .
Parsing [sent. 290 len. 6]: Did n't something tell you ?
Parsing [sent. 291 len. 10]: -- did n't you feel that you were sent ?
Parsing [sent. 292 len. 10]: I could kiss the hem of your laprobe . ''
Parsing [sent. 293 len. 15]: He was not able to speak ; he was helpless with shame and fright .
Parsing [sent. 294 len. 18]: Mrs. Taylor went on : `` Why , just look at it all around , Julia Glossop .
Parsing [sent. 295 len. 11]: Any person can see the hand of Providence in it .
Parsing [sent. 296 len. 8]: Here at noon what do we see ?
Parsing [sent. 297 len. 6]: We see the smoke rising .
Parsing [sent. 298 len. 17]: I speak up and say , ` That 's the Old People 's cabin afire . '
Parsing [sent. 299 len. 8]: Did n't I , Julia Glossop ? ''
Parsing [sent. 300 len. 10]: `` The very words you said , Nancy Taylor .
Parsing [sent. 301 len. 16]: I was as close to you as I am now , and I heard them .
Parsing [sent. 302 len. 17]: You may have said hut instead of cabin , but in substance it 's the same .
Parsing [sent. 303 len. 9]: And you were looking pale , too . ''
Parsing [sent. 304 len. 3]: `` Pale ?
Parsing [sent. 305 len. 17]: I was that pale that if -- why , you just compare it with this laprobe .
Parsing [sent. 306 len. 28]: Then the next thing I said was , ` Mary Taylor , tell the hired man to rig up the team-we 'll go to the rescue . '
Parsing [sent. 307 len. 28]: And she said , ` Mother , do n't you know you told him he could drive to see his people , and stay over Sunday ? '
Parsing [sent. 308 len. 6]: And it was just so .
Parsing [sent. 309 len. 10]: I declare for it , I had forgotten it .
Parsing [sent. 310 len. 14]: ` Then , ' said I , ` we 'll go afoot . '
Parsing [sent. 311 len. 5]: And go we did .
Parsing [sent. 312 len. 9]: And found Sarah Enderby on the road . ''
Parsing [sent. 313 len. 12]: `` And we all went together , '' said Mrs. Enderby .
Parsing [sent. 314 len. 32]: `` And found the cabin set fire to and burnt down by the crazy one , and the poor old things so old and feeble that they could n't go afoot .
Parsing [sent. 315 len. 39]: And we got them to a shady place and made them as comfortable as we could , and began to wonder which way to turn to find some way to get them conveyed to Nancy Taylor 's house .
Parsing [sent. 316 len. 13]: And I spoke up and said -- now what did I say ?
Parsing [sent. 317 len. 12]: Did n't I say , ` Providence will provide ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 318 len. 11]: `` Why sure as you live , so you did !
Parsing [sent. 319 len. 6]: I had forgotten it . ''
Parsing [sent. 320 len. 20]: `` So had I , '' said Mrs. Glossop and Mrs. Taylor ; `` but you certainly said it .
Parsing [sent. 321 len. 7]: Now was n't that remarkable ? ''
Parsing [sent. 322 len. 7]: `` Yes , I said it .
Parsing [sent. 323 len. 51]: And then we went to Mr. Moseley 's , two miles , and all of them were gone to the camp meeting over on Stony Fork ; and then we came all the way back , two miles , and then here , another mile -- and Providence has provided .
Parsing [sent. 324 len. 6]: You see it yourselves . ''
Parsing [sent. 325 len. 23]: They gazed at each other awe-struck , and lifted their hands and said in unison : `` It 's per-fectly wonderful . ''
Parsing [sent. 326 len. 51]: `` And then , '' said Mrs. Glossop , `` what do you think we had better do -- let Mr. Brown drive the Old People to Nancy Taylor 's one at a time , or put both of them in the buggy , and him lead the horse ? ''
Parsing [sent. 327 len. 3]: Brown gasped .
Parsing [sent. 328 len. 15]: `` Now , then , that 's a question , '' said Mrs. Enderby .
Parsing [sent. 329 len. 23]: `` You see , we are all tired out , and any way we fix it it 's going to be difficult .
Parsing [sent. 330 len. 40]: For if Mr. Brown takes both of them , at least one of us must , go back to help him , for he ca n't load them into the buggy by himself , and they so helpless . ''
Parsing [sent. 331 len. 10]: `` That is so , '' said Mrs. Taylor .
Parsing [sent. 332 len. 11]: `` It does n't look-oh , how would this do ?
Parsing [sent. 333 len. 25]: -- one of us drive there with Mr. Brown , and the rest of you go along to my house and get things ready .
Parsing [sent. 334 len. 6]: I 'll go with him .
Parsing [sent. 335 len. 35]: He and I together can lift one of the Old People into the buggy ; then drive her to my house and -- `` But who will take care of the other one ? ''
Parsing [sent. 336 len. 4]: said Mrs. Enderby .
Parsing [sent. 337 len. 20]: `` We mus n't leave her there in the woods alone , you know -- especially the crazy one .
Parsing [sent. 338 len. 11]: There and back is eight miles , you see . ''
Parsing [sent. 339 len. 24]: They had all been sitting on the grass beside the buggy for a while , now , trying to rest their weary bodies .
Parsing [sent. 340 len. 35]: They fell silent a moment or two , and struggled in thought over the baffling situation ; then Mrs. Enderby brightened and said : `` I think I 've got the idea , now .
Parsing [sent. 341 len. 10]: You see , we ca n't walk any more .
Parsing [sent. 342 len. 57]: Think what we 've done : four miles there , two to Moseley 's , is six , then back to here -- nine miles since noon , and not a bite to eat ; I declare I do n't see how we 've done it ; and as for me , I am just famishing .
Parsing [sent. 343 len. 32]: Now , somebody 's got to go back , to help Mr. Brown -- there 's no getting around that ; but whoever goes has got to ride , not walk .
Parsing [sent. 344 len. 78]: So my idea is this : one of us to ride back with Mr. Brown , then ride to Nancy Taylor 's house with one of the Old People , leaving Mr. Brown to keep the other old one company , you all to go now to Nancy 's and rest and wait ; then one of you drive back and get the other one and drive her to Nancy 's , and Mr. Brown walk . ''
Parsing [sent. 345 len. 4]: `` Splendid ! ''
Parsing [sent. 346 len. 4]: they all cried .
Parsing [sent. 347 len. 13]: `` Oh , that will do -- that will answer perfectly . ''
Parsing [sent. 348 len. 35]: And they all said that Mrs. Enderby had the best head for planning , in the company ; and they said that they wondered that they had n't thought of this simple plan themselves .
Parsing [sent. 349 len. 23]: They had n't meant to take back the compliment , good simple souls , and did n't know they had done it .
Parsing [sent. 350 len. 28]: After a consultation it was decided that Mrs. Enderby should drive back with Brown , she being entitled to the distinction because she had invented the plan .
Parsing [sent. 351 len. 82]: Everything now being satisfactorily arranged and settled , the ladies rose , relieved and happy , and brushed down their gowns , and three of them started homeward ; Mrs. Enderby set her foot on the buggy-step and was about to climb in , when Brown found a remnant of his voice and gasped out -- `` Please Mrs. Enderby , call them back -- I am very weak ; I ca n't walk , I ca n't , indeed . ''
Parsing [sent. 352 len. 7]: `` Why , dear Mr. Brown !
Parsing [sent. 353 len. 18]: You do look pale ; I am ashamed of myself that I did n't notice it sooner .
Parsing [sent. 354 len. 5]: Come back-all of you !
Parsing [sent. 355 len. 6]: Mr. Brown is not well .
Parsing [sent. 356 len. 12]: Is there anything I can do for you , Mr. Brown ?
Parsing [sent. 357 len. 6]: -- I 'm real sorry .
Parsing [sent. 358 len. 6]: Are you in pain ? ''
Parsing [sent. 359 len. 28]: `` No , madam , only weak ; I am not sick , but only just weak -- lately ; not long , but just lately . ''
Parsing [sent. 360 len. 27]: The others came back , and poured out their sympathies and commiserations , and were full of self-reproaches for not having noticed how pale he was .
Parsing [sent. 361 len. 23]: And they at once struck out a new plan , and soon agreed that it was by far the best of all .
Parsing [sent. 362 len. 17]: They would all go to Nancy Taylor 's house and see to Brown 's needs first .
Parsing [sent. 363 len. 73]: He could lie on the sofa in the parlor , and while Mrs. Taylor and Mary took care of him the other two ladies would take the buggy and go and get one of the Old People , and leave one of themselves with the other one , and -- By this time , without any solicitation , they were at the horse 's head and were beginning to turn him around .
Parsing [sent. 364 len. 15]: The danger was imminent , but Brown found his voice again and saved himself .
Parsing [sent. 365 len. 17]: He said -- `` But ladies , you are overlooking something which makes the plan impracticable .
Parsing [sent. 366 len. 54]: You see , if you bring one of them home , and one remains behind with the other , there will be three persons there when one of you comes back for that other , for some one must drive the buggy back , and three ca n't come home in it . ''
Parsing [sent. 367 len. 14]: They all exclaimed , `` Why , sure-ly , that is so ! ''
Parsing [sent. 368 len. 8]: and they were , all perplexed again .
Parsing [sent. 369 len. 11]: `` Dear , dear , what can we do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 370 len. 15]: said Mrs. Glossop ; `` it is the most mixed-up thing that ever was .
Parsing [sent. 371 len. 22]: The fox and the goose and the corn and things -- Oh , dear , they are nothing to it . ''
Parsing [sent. 372 len. 20]: They sat wearily down once more , to further torture their tormented heads for a plan that would work .
Parsing [sent. 373 len. 12]: Presently Mary offered a plan ; it was her first effort .
Parsing [sent. 374 len. 16]: She said : `` I am young and strong , and am refreshed , now .
Parsing [sent. 375 len. 20]: Take Mr. Brown to our house , and give him help -- you see how plainly he needs it .
Parsing [sent. 376 len. 20]: I will go back and take care of the Old People ; I can be there in twenty minutes .
Parsing [sent. 377 len. 39]: You can go on and do what you first started to do -- wait on the main road at our house until somebody comes along with a wagon ; then send and bring away the three of us .
Parsing [sent. 378 len. 20]: You wo n't have to wait long ; the farmers will soon be coming back from town , now .
Parsing [sent. 379 len. 19]: I will keep old Polly patient and cheered up -- the crazy one does n't need it . ''
Parsing [sent. 380 len. 32]: This plan was discussed and accepted ; it seemed the best that could be done , in the circumstances , and the Old People must be getting discouraged by this time .
Parsing [sent. 381 len. 9]: Brown felt relieved , and was deeply thankful .
Parsing [sent. 382 len. 17]: Let him once get to the main road and he would find a way to escape .
Parsing [sent. 383 len. 30]: Then Mrs. Taylor said : `` The evening chill will be coming on , pretty soon , and those poor old burnt-out things will need some kind of covering .
Parsing [sent. 384 len. 9]: Take the lap-robe with you , dear . ''
Parsing [sent. 385 len. 10]: `` Very well , Mother , I will . ''
Parsing [sent. 386 len. 22]: She stepped to the buggy and put out her hand to take it -- That was the end of the tale .
Parsing [sent. 387 len. 32]: The passenger who told it said that when he read the story twenty-five years ago in a train he was interrupted at that point -- the train jumped off a bridge .
Parsing [sent. 388 len. 39]: At first we thought we could finish the story quite easily , and we set to work with confidence ; but it soon began to appear that it was not a simple thing , but difficult and baffling .
Parsing [sent. 389 len. 29]: This was on account of Brown 's character -- great generosity and kindliness , but complicated with unusual shyness and diffidence , particularly in the presence of ladies .
Parsing [sent. 390 len. 42]: There was his love for Mary , in a hopeful state but not yet secure -- just in a condition , indeed , where its affair must be handled with great tact , and no mistakes made , no offense given .
Parsing [sent. 391 len. 26]: And there was the mother wavering , half willing-by adroit and flawless diplomacy to be won over , now , or perhaps never at all .
Parsing [sent. 392 len. 32]: Also , there were the helpless Old People yonder in the woods waiting-their fate and Brown 's happiness to be determined by what Brown should do within the next two seconds .
Parsing [sent. 393 len. 17]: Mary was reaching for the lap-robe ; Brown must decide-there was no time to be lost .
Parsing [sent. 394 len. 73]: Of course none but a happy ending of the story would be accepted by the jury ; the finish must find Brown in high credit with the ladies , his behavior without blemish , his modesty unwounded , his character for self sacrifice maintained , the Old People rescued through him , their benefactor , all the party proud of him , happy in him , his praises on all their tongues .
Parsing [sent. 395 len. 16]: We tried to arrange this , but it was beset with persistent and irreconcilable difficulties .
Parsing [sent. 396 len. 16]: We saw that Brown 's shyness would not allow him to give up the lap-robe .
Parsing [sent. 397 len. 48]: This would offend Mary and her mother ; and it would surprise the other ladies , partly because this stinginess toward the suffering Old People would be out of character with Brown , and partly because he was a special Providence and could not properly act so .
Parsing [sent. 398 len. 36]: If asked to explain his conduct , his shyness would not allow him to tell the truth , and lack of invention and practice would find him incapable of contriving a lie that would wash .
Parsing [sent. 399 len. 12]: We worked at the troublesome problem until three in the morning .
Parsing [sent. 400 len. 9]: Meantime Mary was still reaching for the lap-robe .
Parsing [sent. 401 len. 14]: We gave it up , and decided to let her continue to reach .
Parsing [sent. 402 len. 16]: It is the reader 's privilege to determine for himself how the thing came out .
Parsing [sent. 403 len. 3]: CHAPTER III .
Parsing [sent. 404 len. 15]: It is more trouble to make a maxim than it is to do right .
Parsing [sent. 405 len. 9]: -- Pudd ` nhead Wilson 's New Calendar .
Parsing [sent. 406 len. 45]: On the seventh day out we saw a dim vast bulk standing up out of the wastes of the Pacific and knew that that spectral promontory was Diamond Head , a piece of this world which I had not seen before for twenty-nine years .
Parsing [sent. 407 len. 36]: So we were nearing Honolulu , the capital city of the Sandwich Islands -- those islands which to me were Paradise ; a Paradise which I had been longing all those years to see again .
Parsing [sent. 408 len. 20]: Not any other thing in the world could have stirred me as the sight of that great rock did .
Parsing [sent. 409 len. 10]: In the night we anchored a mile from shore .
Parsing [sent. 410 len. 25]: Through my port I could see the twinkling lights of Honolulu and the dark bulk of the mountain-range that stretched away right and left .
Parsing [sent. 411 len. 29]: I could not make out the beautiful Nuuana valley , but I knew where it lay , and remembered how it used to look in the old times .
Parsing [sent. 412 len. 37]: We used to ride up it on horseback in those days -- we young people -- and branch off and gather bones in a sandy region where one of the first Kamehameha 's battles was fought .
Parsing [sent. 413 len. 21]: He was a remarkable man , for a king ; and he was also a remarkable man for a savage .
Parsing [sent. 414 len. 38]: He was a mere kinglet and of little or no consequence at the time of Captain Cook 's arrival in 1788 ; but about four years afterward he conceived the idea of enlarging his sphere of influence .
Parsing [sent. 415 len. 28]: That is a courteous modern phrase which means robbing your neighbor -- for your neighbor 's benefit ; and the great theater of its benevolences is Africa .
Parsing [sent. 416 len. 37]: Kamehameha went to war , and in the course of ten years he whipped out all the other kings and made himself master of every one of the nine or ten islands that form the group .
Parsing [sent. 417 len. 7]: But he did more than that .
Parsing [sent. 418 len. 51]: He bought ships , freighted them with sandal wood and other native products , and sent them as far as South America and China ; he sold to his savages the foreign stuffs and tools and utensils which came back in these ships , and started the march of civilization .
Parsing [sent. 419 len. 22]: It is doubtful if the match to this extraordinary thing is to be found in the history of any other savage .
Parsing [sent. 420 len. 41]: Savages are eager to learn from the white man any new way to kill each other , but it is not their habit to seize with avidity and apply with energy the larger and nobler ideas which he offers them .
Parsing [sent. 421 len. 39]: The details of Kamehameha 's history show that he was always hospitably ready to examine the white man 's ideas , and that he exercised a tidy discrimination in making his selections from the samples placed on view .
Parsing [sent. 422 len. 17]: A shrewder discrimination than was exhibited by his son and successor , Liholiho , I think .
Parsing [sent. 423 len. 19]: Liholiho could have qualified as a reformer , perhaps , but as a king he was a mistake .
Parsing [sent. 424 len. 12]: A mistake because he tried to be both king and reformer .
Parsing [sent. 425 len. 8]: This is mixing fire and gunpowder together .
Parsing [sent. 426 len. 9]: A king has no proper business with reforming .
Parsing [sent. 427 len. 31]: His best policy is to keep things as they are ; and if he ca n't do that , he ought to try to make them worse than they are .
Parsing [sent. 428 len. 41]: This is not guesswork ; I have thought over this matter a good deal , so that if I should ever have a chance to become a king I would know how to conduct the business in the best way .
Parsing [sent. 429 len. 36]: When Liholiho succeeded his father he found himself possessed of an equipment of royal tools and safeguards which a wiser king would have known how to husband , and judiciously employ , and make profitable .
Parsing [sent. 430 len. 15]: The entire country was under the one scepter , and his was that scepter .
Parsing [sent. 431 len. 14]: There was an Established Church , and he was the head of it .
Parsing [sent. 432 len. 29]: There was a Standing Army , and he was the head of that ; an Army of 114 privates under command of 27 Generals and a Field Marshal .
Parsing [sent. 433 len. 9]: There was a proud and ancient Hereditary Nobility .
Parsing [sent. 434 len. 7]: There was still one other asset .
Parsing [sent. 435 len. 36]: This was the tabu -- an agent endowed with a mysterious and stupendous power , an agent not found among the properties of any European monarch , a tool of inestimable value in the business .
Parsing [sent. 436 len. 7]: Liholiho was headmaster of the tabu .
Parsing [sent. 437 len. 26]: The tabu was the most ingenious and effective of all the inventions that has ever been devised for keeping a people 's privileges satisfactorily restricted .
Parsing [sent. 438 len. 10]: It required the sexes to live in separate houses .
Parsing [sent. 439 len. 18]: It did not allow people to eat in either house ; they must eat in another place .
Parsing [sent. 440 len. 13]: It did not allow a man 's woman-folk to enter his house .
Parsing [sent. 441 len. 24]: It did not allow the sexes to eat together ; the men must eat first , and the women must wait on them .
Parsing [sent. 442 len. 19]: Then the women could eat what was left -- if anything was left -- and wait on themselves .
Parsing [sent. 443 len. 20]: I mean , if anything of a coarse or unpalatable sort was left , the women could have it .
Parsing [sent. 444 len. 34]: But not the good things , the fine things , the choice things , such as pork , poultry , bananas , cocoanuts , the choicer varieties of fish , and so on .
Parsing [sent. 445 len. 35]: By the tabu , all these were sacred to the men ; the women spent their lives longing for them and wondering what they might taste like ; and they died without finding out .
Parsing [sent. 446 len. 13]: These rules , as you see , were quite simple and clear .
Parsing [sent. 447 len. 10]: It was easy to remember them ; and useful .
Parsing [sent. 448 len. 14]: For the penalty for infringing any rule in the whole list was death .
Parsing [sent. 449 len. 24]: Those women easily learned to put up with shark and taro and dog for a diet when the other things were so expensive .
Parsing [sent. 450 len. 40]: It was death for any one to walk upon tabu 'd ground ; or defile a tabu 'd thing with his touch ; or fail in due servility to a chief ; or step upon the king 's shadow .
Parsing [sent. 451 len. 39]: The nobles and the King and the priests were always suspending little rags here and there and yonder , to give notice to the people that the decorated spot or thing was tabu , and death lurking near .
Parsing [sent. 452 len. 15]: The struggle for life was difficult and chancy in the islands in those days .
Parsing [sent. 453 len. 8]: Thus advantageously was the new king situated .
Parsing [sent. 454 len. 21]: Will it be believed that the first thing he did was to destroy his Established Church , root and branch ?
Parsing [sent. 455 len. 6]: He did indeed do that .
Parsing [sent. 456 len. 21]: To state the case figuratively , he was a prosperous sailor who burnt his ship and took to a raft .
Parsing [sent. 457 len. 7]: This Church was a horrid thing .
Parsing [sent. 458 len. 56]: It heavily oppressed the people ; it kept them always trembling in the gloom of mysterious threatenings ; it slaughtered them in sacrifice before its grotesque idols of wood and stone ; it cowed them , it terrorized them , it made them slaves to its priests , and through the priests to the king .
Parsing [sent. 459 len. 15]: It was the best friend a king could have , and the most dependable .
Parsing [sent. 460 len. 55]: To a professional reformer who should annihilate so frightful and so devastating a power as this Church , reverence and praise would be due ; but to a king who should do it , could properly be due nothing but reproach ; reproach softened by sorrow ; sorrow for his unfitness for his position .
Parsing [sent. 461 len. 20]: He destroyed his Established Church , and his kingdom is a republic today , in consequence of that act .
Parsing [sent. 462 len. 31]: When he destroyed the Church and burned the idols he did a mighty thing for civilization and for his people 's weal -- but it was not `` business . ''
Parsing [sent. 463 len. 8]: It was unkingly , it was inartistic .
Parsing [sent. 464 len. 7]: It made trouble for his line .
Parsing [sent. 465 len. 12]: The American missionaries arrived while the burned idols were still smoking .
Parsing [sent. 466 len. 14]: They found the nation without a religion , and they repaired the defect .
Parsing [sent. 467 len. 11]: They offered their own religion and it was gladly received .
Parsing [sent. 468 len. 21]: But it was no support to arbitrary kingship , and so the kingly power began to weaken from that day .
Parsing [sent. 469 len. 25]: Forty-seven years later , when I was in the islands , Kamehameha V. was trying to repair Liholiho 's blunder , and not succeeding .
Parsing [sent. 470 len. 15]: He had set up an Established Church and made himself the head of it .
Parsing [sent. 471 len. 18]: But it was only a pinchbeck thing , an imitation , a bauble , an empty show .
Parsing [sent. 472 len. 11]: It had no power , no value for a king .
Parsing [sent. 473 len. 21]: It could not harry or burn or slay , it in no way resembled the admirable machine which Liholiho destroyed .
Parsing [sent. 474 len. 15]: It was an Established Church without an Establishment ; all the people were Dissenters .
Parsing [sent. 475 len. 16]: Long before that , the kingship had itself become but a name , a show .
Parsing [sent. 476 len. 32]: At an early day the missionaries had turned it into something very much like a republic ; and here lately the business whites have turned it into something exactly like it .
Parsing [sent. 477 len. 42]: In Captain Cook 's time -LRB- 1778 -RRB- , the native population of the islands was estimated at 400,000 ; in 1836 at something short of 200,000 , in 1866 at 50,000 ; it is to-day , per census , 25,000 .
Parsing [sent. 478 len. 19]: All intelligent people praise Kamehameha I. and Liholiho for conferring upon their people the great boon of civilization .
Parsing [sent. 479 len. 19]: I would do it myself , but my intelligence is out of repair , now , from over-work .
Parsing [sent. 480 len. 48]: When I was in the islands nearly a generation ago , I was acquainted with a young American couple who had among their belongings an attractive little son of the age of seven -- attractive but not practicably companionable with me , because he knew no English .
Parsing [sent. 481 len. 27]: He had played from his birth with the little Kanakas on his father 's plantation , and had preferred their language and would learn no other .
Parsing [sent. 482 len. 28]: The family removed to America a month after I arrived in the islands , and straightway the boy began to lose his Kanaka and pick up English .
Parsing [sent. 483 len. 28]: By the time he was twelve he had n't a word of Kanaka left ; the language had wholly departed from his tongue and from his comprehension .
Parsing [sent. 484 len. 39]: Nine years later , when he was twenty-one , I came upon the family in one of the lake towns of New York , and the mother told me about an adventure which her son had been having .
Parsing [sent. 485 len. 9]: By trade he was now a professional diver .
Parsing [sent. 486 len. 24]: A passenger boat had been caught in a storm on the lake , and had gone down , carrying her people with her .
Parsing [sent. 487 len. 44]: A few days later the young diver descended , with his armor on , and entered the berth-saloon of the boat , and stood at the foot of the companionway , with his hand on the rail , peering through the dim water .
Parsing [sent. 488 len. 27]: Presently something touched him on the shoulder , and he turned and found a dead man swaying and bobbing about him and seemingly inspecting him inquiringly .
Parsing [sent. 489 len. 6]: He was paralyzed with fright .
Parsing [sent. 490 len. 34]: His entry had disturbed the water , and now he discerned a number of dim corpses making for him and wagging their heads and swaying their bodies like sleepy people trying to dance .
Parsing [sent. 491 len. 16]: His senses forsook him , and in that condition he was drawn to the surface .
Parsing [sent. 492 len. 14]: He was put to bed at home , and was soon very ill .
Parsing [sent. 493 len. 31]: During some days he had seasons of delirium which lasted several hours at a time ; and while they lasted he talked Kanaka incessantly and glibly ; and Kanaka only .
Parsing [sent. 494 len. 25]: He was still very ill , and he talked to me in that tongue ; but I did not understand it , of course .
Parsing [sent. 495 len. 12]: The doctor-books tell us that cases like this are not uncommon .
Parsing [sent. 496 len. 16]: Then the doctors ought to study the cases and find out how to multiply them .
Parsing [sent. 497 len. 21]: Many languages and things get mislaid in a person 's head , and stay mislaid for lack of this remedy .
Parsing [sent. 498 len. 26]: Many memories of my former visit to the islands came up in my mind while we lay at anchor in front of Honolulu that night .
Parsing [sent. 499 len. 12]: And pictures -- pictures pictures -- an enchanting procession of them !
Parsing [sent. 500 len. 9]: I was impatient for the morning to come .
Parsing [sent. 501 len. 10]: When it came it brought disappointment , of course .
Parsing [sent. 502 len. 21]: Cholera had broken out in the town , and we were not allowed to have any communication with the shore .
Parsing [sent. 503 len. 12]: Thus suddenly did my dream of twenty-nine years go to ruin .
Parsing [sent. 504 len. 18]: Messages came from friends , but the friends themselves I was not to have any sight of .
Parsing [sent. 505 len. 15]: My lecture-hall was ready , but I was not to see that , either .
Parsing [sent. 506 len. 22]: Several of our passengers belonged in Honolulu , and these were sent ashore ; but nobody could go ashore and return .
Parsing [sent. 507 len. 33]: There were people on shore who were booked to go with us to Australia , but we could not receive them ; to do it would cost us a quarantine-term in Sydney .
Parsing [sent. 508 len. 44]: They could have escaped the day before , by ship to San Francisco ; but the bars had been put up , now , and they might have to wait weeks before any ship could venture to give them a passage any whither .
Parsing [sent. 509 len. 7]: And there were hardships for others .
Parsing [sent. 510 len. 77]: An elderly lady and her son , recreation-seekers from Massachusetts , had wandered westward , further and further from home , always intending to take the return track , but always concluding to go still a little further ; and now here they were at anchor before Honolulu positively their last westward-bound indulgence -- they had made up their minds to that -- but where is the use in making up your mind in this world ?
Parsing [sent. 511 len. 11]: It is usually a waste of time to do it .
Parsing [sent. 512 len. 13]: These two would have to stay with us as far as Australia .
Parsing [sent. 513 len. 44]: Then they could go on around the world , or go back the way they had come ; the distance and the accommodations and outlay of time would be just the same , whichever of the two routes they might elect to take .
Parsing [sent. 514 len. 27]: Think of it : a projected excursion of five hundred miles gradually enlarged , without any elaborate degree of intention , to a possible twenty-four thousand .
Parsing [sent. 515 len. 20]: However , they were used to extensions by this time , and did not mind this new one much .
Parsing [sent. 516 len. 48]: And we had with us a lawyer from Victoria , who had been sent out by the Government on an international matter , and he had brought his wife with him and left the children at home with the servants and now what was to be done ?
Parsing [sent. 517 len. 10]: Go ashore amongst the cholera and take the risks ?
Parsing [sent. 518 len. 4]: Most certainly not .
Parsing [sent. 519 len. 26]: They decided to go on , to the Fiji islands , wait there a fortnight for the next ship , and then sail for home .
Parsing [sent. 520 len. 43]: They could n't foresee that they would n't see a homeward-bound ship again for six weeks , and that no word could come to them from the children , and no word go from them to the children in all that time .
Parsing [sent. 521 len. 44]: It is easy to make plans in this world ; even a cat can do it ; and when one is out in those remote oceans it is noticeable that a cat 's plans and a man 's are worth about the same .
Parsing [sent. 522 len. 15]: There is much the same shrinkage in both , in the matter of values .
Parsing [sent. 523 len. 25]: There was nothing for us to do but sit about the decks in the shade of the awnings and look at the distant shore .
Parsing [sent. 524 len. 39]: We lay in luminous blue water ; shoreward the water was green-green and brilliant ; at the shore itself it broke in a long white ruffle , and with no crash , no sound that we could hear .
Parsing [sent. 525 len. 17]: The town was buried under a mat of foliage that looked like a cushion of moss .
Parsing [sent. 526 len. 25]: The silky mountains were clothed in soft , rich splendors of melting color , and some of the cliffs were veiled in slanting mists .
Parsing [sent. 527 len. 5]: I recognized it all .
Parsing [sent. 528 len. 24]: It was just as I had seen it long before , with nothing of its beauty lost , nothing of its charm wanting .
Parsing [sent. 529 len. 17]: A change had come , but that was political , and not visible from the ship .
Parsing [sent. 530 len. 17]: The monarchy of my day was gone , and a republic was sitting in its seat .
Parsing [sent. 531 len. 7]: It was not a material change .
Parsing [sent. 532 len. 30]: The old imitation pomps , the fuss and feathers , have departed , and the royal trademark -- that is about all that one could miss , I suppose .
Parsing [sent. 533 len. 34]: That imitation monarchy , was grotesque enough , in my time ; if it had held on another thirty years it would have been a monarchy without subjects of the king 's race .
Parsing [sent. 534 len. 10]: We had a sunset of a very fine sort .
Parsing [sent. 535 len. 74]: The vast plain of the sea was marked off in bands of sharply-contrasted colors : great stretches of dark blue , others of purple , others of polished bronze ; the billowy mountains showed all sorts of dainty browns and greens , blues and purples and blacks , and the rounded velvety backs of certain of them made one want to stroke them , as one would the sleek back of a cat .
Parsing [sent. 536 len. 43]: The long , sloping promontory projecting into the sea at the west turned dim and leaden and spectral , then became suffused with pink -- dissolved itself in a pink dream , so to speak , it seemed so airy and unreal .
Parsing [sent. 537 len. 32]: Presently the cloud-rack was flooded with fiery splendors , and these were copied on the surface of the sea , and it made one drunk with delight to look upon it .
Parsing [sent. 538 len. 43]: From talks with certain of our passengers whose home was Honolulu , and from a sketch by Mrs. Mary H. Krout , I was able to perceive what the Honolulu of to-day is , as compared with the Honolulu of my time .
Parsing [sent. 539 len. 46]: In my time it was a beautiful little town , made up of snow-white wooden cottages deliciously smothered in tropical vines and flowers and trees and shrubs ; and its coral roads and streets were hard and smooth , and as white as the houses .
Parsing [sent. 540 len. 30]: The outside aspects of the place suggested the presence of a modest and comfortable prosperity -- a general prosperity -- perhaps one might strengthen the term and say universal .
Parsing [sent. 541 len. 10]: There were no fine houses , no fine furniture .
Parsing [sent. 542 len. 5]: There were no decorations .
Parsing [sent. 543 len. 18]: Tallow candles furnished the light for the bedrooms , a whale-oil lamp furnished it for the parlor .
Parsing [sent. 544 len. 6]: Native matting served as carpeting .
Parsing [sent. 545 len. 57]: In the parlor one would find two or three lithographs on the walls -- portraits as a rule : Kamehameha IV. , Louis Kossuth , Jenny Lind ; and may be an engraving or two : Rebecca at the Well , Moses smiting the rock , Joseph 's servants finding the cup in Benjamin 's sack .
Parsing [sent. 546 len. 52]: There would be a center table , with books of a tranquil sort on it : The Whole Duty of Man , Baxter 's Saints ' Rest , Fox 's Martyrs , Tupper 's Proverbial Philosophy , bound copies of The Missionary Herald and of Father Damon 's Seaman 's Friend .
Parsing [sent. 547 len. 61]: A melodeon ; a music stand , with ` Willie , We have Missed You ' , ` Star of the Evening ' , ` Roll on Silver Moon ' , ` Are We Most There ' , ' I Would not Live Alway ' , and other songs of love and sentiment , together with an assortment of hymns .
Parsing [sent. 548 len. 46]: A what-not with semi-globular glass paperweights , enclosing miniature pictures of ships , New England rural snowstorms , and the like ; sea-shells with Bible texts carved on them in cameo style ; native curios ; whale 's tooth with full-rigged ship carved on it .
Parsing [sent. 549 len. 14]: There was nothing reminiscent of foreign parts , for nobody had been abroad .
Parsing [sent. 550 len. 16]: Trips were made to San Francisco , but that could not be called going abroad .
Parsing [sent. 551 len. 6]: Comprehensively speaking , nobody traveled .
Parsing [sent. 552 len. 24]: But Honolulu has grown wealthy since then , and of course wealth has introduced changes ; some of the old simplicities have disappeared .
Parsing [sent. 553 len. 38]: Here is a modern house , as pictured by Mrs. Krout : `` Almost every house is surrounded by extensive lawns and gardens enclosed by walls of volcanic stone or by thick hedges of the brilliant hibiscus .
Parsing [sent. 554 len. 73]: `` The houses are most tastefully and comfortably furnished ; the floors are either of hard wood covered with rugs or with fine Indian matting , while there is a preference , as in most warm countries , for rattan or bamboo furniture ; there are the usual accessories of bric-a-brac , pictures , books , and curios from all parts of the world , for these island dwellers are indefatigable travelers .
Parsing [sent. 555 len. 11]: `` Nearly every house has what is called a lanai .
Parsing [sent. 556 len. 27]: It is a large apartment , roofed , floored , open on three sides , with a door or a draped archway opening into the drawing-room .
Parsing [sent. 557 len. 30]: Frequently the roof is formed by the thick interlacing boughs of the hou tree , impervious to the sun and even to the rain , except in violent storms .
Parsing [sent. 558 len. 25]: Vines are trained about the sides -- the stephanotis or some one of the countless fragrant and blossoming trailers which abound in the islands .
Parsing [sent. 559 len. 17]: There are also curtains of matting that may be drawn to exclude the sun or rain .
Parsing [sent. 560 len. 37]: The floor is bare for coolness , or partially covered with rugs , and the lanai is prettily furnished with comfortable chairs , sofas , and tables loaded with flowers , or wonderful ferns in pots .
Parsing [sent. 561 len. 69]: `` The lanai is the favorite reception room , and here at any social function the musical program is given and cakes and ices are served ; here morning callers are received , or gay riding parties , the ladies in pretty divided skirts , worn for convenience in riding astride , -- the universal mode adopted by Europeans and Americans , as well as by the natives .
Parsing [sent. 562 len. 21]: `` The comfort and luxury of such an apartment , especially at a seashore villa , can hardly be imagined .
Parsing [sent. 563 len. 66]: The soft breezes sweep across it , heavy with the fragrance of jasmine and gardenia , and through the swaying boughs of palm and mimosa there are glimpses of rugged mountains , their summits veiled in clouds , of purple sea with the white surf beating eternally against the reefs , whiter still in the yellow sunlight or the magical moonlight of the tropics . ''
Parsing [sent. 564 len. 19]: There : rugs , ices , pictures , lanais , worldly books , sinful bric-a-brac fetched from everywhere .
Parsing [sent. 565 len. 6]: And the ladies riding astride .
Parsing [sent. 566 len. 6]: These are changes , indeed .
Parsing [sent. 567 len. 22]: In my time the native women rode astride , but the white ones lacked the courage to adopt their wise custom .
Parsing [sent. 568 len. 10]: In my time ice was seldom seen in Honolulu .
Parsing [sent. 569 len. 49]: It sometimes came in sailing vessels from New England as ballast ; and then , if there happened to be a man-of-war in port and balls and suppers raging by consequence , the ballast was worth six hundred dollars a ton , as is evidenced by reputable tradition .
Parsing [sent. 570 len. 20]: But the ice-machine has traveled all over the world , now , and brought ice within everybody 's reach .
Parsing [sent. 571 len. 20]: In Lapland and Spitzbergen no one uses native ice in our day , except the bears and the walruses .
Parsing [sent. 572 len. 6]: The bicycle is not mentioned .
Parsing [sent. 573 len. 5]: It was not necessary .
Parsing [sent. 574 len. 10]: We know that it is there , without inquiring .
Parsing [sent. 575 len. 4]: It is everywhere .
Parsing [sent. 576 len. 31]: But for it , people could never have had summer homes on the summit of Mont Blanc ; before its day , property up there had but a nominal value .
Parsing [sent. 577 len. 26]: The ladies of the Hawaiian capital learned too late the right way to occupy a horse -- too late to get much benefit from it .
Parsing [sent. 578 len. 11]: The riding-horse is retiring from business everywhere in the world .
Parsing [sent. 579 len. 14]: In Honolulu a few years from now he will be only a tradition .
Parsing [sent. 580 len. 80]: We all know about Father Damien , the French priest who voluntarily forsook the world and went to the leper island of Molokai to labor among its population of sorrowful exiles who wait there , in slow-consuming misery , for death to come and release them from their troubles ; and we know that the thing which he knew beforehand would happen , did happen : that he became a leper himself , and died of that horrible disease .
Parsing [sent. 581 len. 11]: There was still another case of self-sacrifice , it appears .
Parsing [sent. 582 len. 19]: I asked after `` Billy '' Ragsdale , interpreter to the Parliament in my time -- a half-white .
Parsing [sent. 583 len. 11]: He was a brilliant young fellow , and very popular .
Parsing [sent. 584 len. 12]: As an interpreter he would have been hard to match anywhere .
Parsing [sent. 585 len. 31]: He used to stand up in the Parliament and turn the English speeches into Hawaiian and the Hawaiian speeches into English with a readiness and a volubility that were astonishing .
Parsing [sent. 586 len. 34]: I asked after him , and was told that his prosperous career was cut short in a sudden and unexpected way , just as he was about to marry a beautiful half-caste girl .
Parsing [sent. 587 len. 21]: He discovered , by some nearly invisible sign about his skin , that the poison of leprosy was in him .
Parsing [sent. 588 len. 38]: The secret was his own , and might be kept concealed for years ; but he would not be treacherous to the girl that loved him ; he would not marry her to a doom like his .
Parsing [sent. 589 len. 30]: And so he put his affairs in order , and went around to all his friends and bade them good-bye , and sailed in the leper ship to Molokai .
Parsing [sent. 590 len. 13]: There he died the loathsome and lingering death that all lepers die .
Parsing [sent. 591 len. 29]: In this place let me insert a paragraph or two from `` The Paradise of the Pacific '' -LRB- Rev. H. H. Gowen -RRB- -- `` Poor lepers !
Parsing [sent. 592 len. 41]: It is easy for those who have no relatives or friends among them to enforce the decree of segregation to the letter , but who can write of the terrible , the heart-breaking scenes which that enforcement has brought about ?
Parsing [sent. 593 len. 28]: `` A man upon Hawaii was suddenly taken away after a summary arrest , leaving behind him a helpless wife about to give birth to a babe .
Parsing [sent. 594 len. 40]: The devoted wife with great pain and risk came the whole journey to Honolulu , and pleaded until the authorities were unable to resist her entreaty that she might go and live like a leper with her leper husband .
Parsing [sent. 595 len. 39]: `` A woman in the prime of life and activity is condemned as an incipient leper , suddenly removed from her home , and her husband returns to find his two helpless babes moaning for their lost mother .
Parsing [sent. 596 len. 4]: `` Imagine it !
Parsing [sent. 597 len. 69]: The case of the babies is hard , but its bitterness is a trifle -- less than a trifle -- less than nothing -- compared to what the mother must suffer ; and suffer minute by minute , hour by hour , day by day , month by month , year by year , without respite , relief , or any abatement of her pain till she dies .
Parsing [sent. 598 len. 21]: `` One woman , Luka Kaaukau , has been living with her leper husband in the settlement for twelve years .
Parsing [sent. 599 len. 31]: The man has scarcely a joint left , his limbs are only distorted ulcerated stumps , for four years his wife has put every particle of food into his mouth .
Parsing [sent. 600 len. 46]: He wanted his wife to abandon his wretched carcass long ago , as she herself was sound and well , but Luka said that she was content to remain and wait on the man she loved till the spirit should be freed from its burden .
Parsing [sent. 601 len. 109]: `` I myself have known hard cases enough : -- of a girl , apparently in full health , decorating the church with me at Easter , who before Christmas is taken away as a confirmed leper ; of a mother hiding her child in the mountains for years so that not even her dearest friends knew that she had a child alive , that he might not be taken away ; of a respectable white man taken away from his wife and family , and compelled to become a dweller in the Leper Settlement , where he is counted dead , even by the insurance companies . ''
Parsing [sent. 602 len. 16]: And one great pity of it all is , that these poor sufferers are innocent .
Parsing [sent. 603 len. 26]: The leprosy does not come of sins which they committed , but of sins committed by their ancestors , who escaped the curse of leprosy !
Parsing [sent. 604 len. 12]: Mr. Gowan has made record of a certain very striking circumstance .
Parsing [sent. 605 len. 21]: Would you expect to find in that awful Leper Settlement a custom worthy to be transplanted to your own country ?
Parsing [sent. 606 len. 13]: They have one such , and it is inexpressibly touching and beautiful .
Parsing [sent. 607 len. 23]: When death sets open the prison-door of life there , the band salutes the freed soul with a burst of glad music !
Parsing [sent. 608 len. 3]: CHAPTER IV .
Parsing [sent. 609 len. 13]: A dozen direct censures are easier to bear than one morganatic compliment .
Parsing [sent. 610 len. 9]: -- Pudd ` nhead Wilson 's New Calendar .
Parsing [sent. 611 len. 4]: Sailed from Honolulu .
Parsing [sent. 612 len. 7]: -- From diary : Sept. 2 .
Parsing [sent. 613 len. 13]: Flocks of flying fish-slim , shapely , graceful , and intensely white .
Parsing [sent. 614 len. 14]: With the sun on them they look like a flight of silver fruit-knives .
Parsing [sent. 615 len. 9]: They are able to fly a hundred yards .
Parsing [sent. 616 len. 3]: Sept. 3 .
Parsing [sent. 617 len. 4]: In 9 deg .
Parsing [sent. 618 len. 8]: 50 ' north latitude , at breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 619 len. 8]: Approaching the equator on a long slant .
Parsing [sent. 620 len. 15]: Those of us who have never seen the equator are a good deal excited .
Parsing [sent. 621 len. 15]: I think I would rather see it than any other thing in the world .
Parsing [sent. 622 len. 50]: We entered the `` doldrums '' last night -- variable winds , bursts of rain , intervals of calm , with chopping seas and a wobbly and drunken motion to the ship -- a condition of things findable in other regions sometimes , but present in the doldrums always .
Parsing [sent. 623 len. 24]: The globe-girdling belt called the doldrums is 20 degrees wide , and the thread called the equator lies along the middle of it .
Parsing [sent. 624 len. 3]: Sept. 4 .
Parsing [sent. 625 len. 8]: Total eclipse of the moon last night .
Parsing [sent. 626 len. 8]: At 7.30 it began to go off .
Parsing [sent. 627 len. 36]: At total -- or about that -- it was like a rich rosy cloud with a tumbled surface framed in the circle and projecting from it -- a bulge of strawberry-ice , so to speak .
Parsing [sent. 628 len. 13]: At half-eclipse the moon was like a gilded acorn in its cup .
Parsing [sent. 629 len. 3]: Sept. 5 .
Parsing [sent. 630 len. 8]: Closing in on the equator this noon .
Parsing [sent. 631 len. 49]: A sailor explained to a young girl that the ship 's speed is poor because we are climbing up the bulge toward the center of the globe ; but that when we should once get over , at the equator , and start down-hill , we should fly .
Parsing [sent. 632 len. 31]: When she asked him the other day what the fore-yard was , he said it was the front yard , the open area in the front end of the ship .
Parsing [sent. 633 len. 21]: That man has a good deal of learning stored up , and the girl is likely to get it all .
Parsing [sent. 634 len. 2]: Afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 635 len. 4]: Crossed the equator .
Parsing [sent. 636 len. 14]: In the distance it looked like a blue ribbon stretched across the ocean .
Parsing [sent. 637 len. 6]: Several passengers kodak 'd it .
Parsing [sent. 638 len. 13]: We had no fool ceremonies , no fantastics , no horse play .
Parsing [sent. 639 len. 9]: All that sort of thing has gone out .
Parsing [sent. 640 len. 58]: In old times a sailor , dressed as Neptune , used to come in over the bows , with his suite , and lather up and shave everybody who was crossing the equator for the first time , and then cleanse these unfortunates by swinging them from the yard-arm and ducking them three times in the sea .
Parsing [sent. 641 len. 5]: This was considered funny .
Parsing [sent. 642 len. 4]: Nobody knows why .
Parsing [sent. 643 len. 7]: No , that is not true .
Parsing [sent. 644 len. 5]: We do know why .
Parsing [sent. 645 len. 45]: Such a thing could never be funny on land ; no part of the old-time grotesque performances gotten up on shipboard to celebrate the passage of the line could ever be funny on shore -- they would seem dreary and witless to shore people .
Parsing [sent. 646 len. 18]: But the shore people would change their minds about it at sea , on a long voyage .
Parsing [sent. 647 len. 39]: On such a voyage , with its eternal monotonies , people 's intellects deteriorate ; the owners of the intellects soon reach a point where they almost seem to prefer childish things to things of a maturer degree .
Parsing [sent. 648 len. 33]: One is often surprised at the juvenilities which grown people indulge in at sea , and the interest they take in them , and the consuming enjoyment they get out of them .
Parsing [sent. 649 len. 7]: This is on long voyages only .
Parsing [sent. 650 len. 36]: The mind gradually becomes inert , dull , blunted ; it loses its accustomed interest in intellectual things ; nothing but horse-play can rouse it , nothing but wild and foolish grotesqueries can entertain it .
Parsing [sent. 651 len. 23]: On short voyages it makes no such exposure of itself ; it has n't time to slump down to this sorrowful level .
Parsing [sent. 652 len. 16]: The short-voyage passenger gets his chief physical exercise out of `` horse-billiards '' -- shovel-board .
Parsing [sent. 653 len. 6]: It is a good game .
Parsing [sent. 654 len. 7]: We play it in this ship .
Parsing [sent. 655 len. 11]: A quartermaster chalks off a diagram like this-on the deck .
Parsing [sent. 656 len. 22]: The player uses a cue that is like a broom-handle with a quarter-moon of wood fastened to the end of it .
Parsing [sent. 657 len. 41]: With this he shoves wooden disks the size of a saucer -- he gives the disk a vigorous shove and sends it fifteen or twenty feet along the deck and lands it in one of the squares if he can .
Parsing [sent. 658 len. 32]: If it stays there till the inning is played out , it will count as many points in the game as the figure in the square it has stopped in represents .
Parsing [sent. 659 len. 77]: The adversary plays to knock that disk out and leave his own in its place -- particularly if it rests upon the 9 or 10 or some other of the high numbers ; but if it rests in the `` 10off '' he backs it up -- lands his disk behind it a foot or two , to make it difficult for its owner to knock it out of that damaging place and improve his record .
Parsing [sent. 660 len. 65]: When the inning is played out it may be found that each adversary has placed his four disks where they count ; it may be found that some of them are touching chalk lines and not counting ; and very often it will be found that there has been a general wreckage , and that not a disk has been left within the diagram .
Parsing [sent. 661 len. 17]: Anyway , the result is recorded , whatever it is , and the game goes on .
Parsing [sent. 662 len. 28]: The game is 100 points , and it takes from twenty minutes to forty to play it , according to luck and the condition of the sea .
Parsing [sent. 663 len. 27]: It is an exciting game , and the crowd of spectators furnish abundance of applause for fortunate shots and plenty of laughter for the other kind .
Parsing [sent. 664 len. 40]: It is a game of skill , but at the same time the uneasy motion of the ship is constantly interfering with skill ; this makes it a chancy game , and the element of luck comes largely in .
Parsing [sent. 665 len. 64]: We had a couple of grand tournaments , to determine who should be `` Champion of the Pacific '' ; they included among the participants nearly all the passengers , of both sexes , and the officers of the ship , and they afforded many days of stupendous interest and excitement , and murderous exercise -- for horse-billiards is a physically violent game .
Parsing [sent. 666 len. 31]: The figures in the following record of some of the closing games in the first tournament will show , better than any description , how very chancy the game is .
Parsing [sent. 667 len. 84]: The losers here represented had all been winners in the previous games of the series , some of them by fine majorities : Chase ,102 Mrs. D. ,57 Mortimer , 105 The Surgeon , 92 Miss C. ,105 Mrs. T. ,9 Clemens , 101 Taylor ,92 Taylor ,109 Davies ,95 Miss C. , 108 Mortimer ,55 Thomas ,102 Roper ,76 Clemens , 111 Miss C. ,89 Coomber , 106 Chase ,98 And so on ; until but three couples of winners were left .
Parsing [sent. 668 len. 17]: Then I beat my man , young Smith beat his man , and Thomas beat his .
Parsing [sent. 669 len. 7]: This reduced the combatants to three .
Parsing [sent. 670 len. 12]: Smith and I took the deck , and I led off .
Parsing [sent. 671 len. 19]: At the close of the first inning I was 10 worse than nothing and Smith had scored 7 .
Parsing [sent. 672 len. 6]: The luck continued against me .
Parsing [sent. 673 len. 14]: When I was 57 , Smith was 97 -- within 3 of out .
Parsing [sent. 674 len. 5]: The luck changed then .
Parsing [sent. 675 len. 13]: He picked up a 10-off or so , and could n't recover .
Parsing [sent. 676 len. 4]: I beat him .
Parsing [sent. 677 len. 9]: The next game would end tournament No. 1 .
Parsing [sent. 678 len. 8]: Mr. Thomas and I were the contestants .
Parsing [sent. 679 len. 14]: He won the lead and went to the bat -- so to speak .
Parsing [sent. 680 len. 32]: And there he stood , with the crotch of his cue resting against his disk while the ship rose slowly up , sank slowly down , rose again , sank again .
Parsing [sent. 681 len. 10]: She never seemed to rise to suit him exactly .
Parsing [sent. 682 len. 32]: She started up once more ; and when she was nearly ready for the turn , he let drive and landed his disk just within the left-hand end of the 10 .
Parsing [sent. 683 len. 4]: -LRB- Applause -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 684 len. 16]: The umpire proclaimed `` a good 10 , '' and the game-keeper set it down .
Parsing [sent. 685 len. 21]: I played : my disk grazed the edge of Mr. Thomas 's disk , and went out of the diagram .
Parsing [sent. 686 len. 5]: -LRB- No applause . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 687 len. 22]: Mr. Thomas played again -- and landed his second disk alongside of the first , and almost touching its right-hand side .
Parsing [sent. 688 len. 5]: `` Good 10 . ''
Parsing [sent. 689 len. 5]: -LRB- Great applause . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 690 len. 9]: I played , and missed both of them .
Parsing [sent. 691 len. 5]: -LRB- No applause . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 692 len. 19]: Mr. Thomas delivered his third shot and landed his disk just at the right of the other two .
Parsing [sent. 693 len. 5]: `` Good 10 . ''
Parsing [sent. 694 len. 5]: -LRB- Immense applause . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 695 len. 14]: There they lay , side by side , the three in a row .
Parsing [sent. 696 len. 11]: It did not seem possible that anybody could miss them .
Parsing [sent. 697 len. 5]: Still I did it .
Parsing [sent. 698 len. 5]: -LRB- Immense silence . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 699 len. 7]: Mr. Thomas played his last disk .
Parsing [sent. 700 len. 29]: It seems incredible , but he actually landed that disk alongside of the others , and just to the right of them-a straight solid row of 4 disks .
Parsing [sent. 701 len. 7]: -LRB- Tumultuous and long-continued applause . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 702 len. 7]: Then I played my last disk .
Parsing [sent. 703 len. 45]: Again it did not seem possible that anybody could miss that row -- a row which would have been 14 inches long if the disks had been clamped together ; whereas , with the spaces separating them they made a longer row than that .
Parsing [sent. 704 len. 5]: But I did it .
Parsing [sent. 705 len. 9]: It may be that I was getting nervous .
Parsing [sent. 706 len. 18]: I think it unlikely that that innings has ever had its parallel in the history of horse-billiards .
Parsing [sent. 707 len. 25]: To place the four disks side by side in the 10 was an extraordinary feat ; indeed , it was a kind of miracle .
Parsing [sent. 708 len. 7]: To miss them was another miracle .
Parsing [sent. 709 len. 34]: It will take a century to produce another man who can place the four disks in the 10 ; and longer than that to find a man who ca n't knock them out .
Parsing [sent. 710 len. 27]: I was ashamed of my performance at the time , but now that I reflect upon it I see that it was rather fine and difficult .
Parsing [sent. 711 len. 16]: Mr. Thomas kept his luck , and won the game , and later the championship .
Parsing [sent. 712 len. 15]: In a minor tournament I won the prize , which was a Waterbury watch .
Parsing [sent. 713 len. 7]: I put it in my trunk .
Parsing [sent. 714 len. 57]: In Pretoria , South Africa , nine months afterward , my proper watch broke down and I took the Waterbury out , wound it , set it by the great clock on the Parliament House -LRB- 8.05 -RRB- , then went back to my room and went to bed , tired from a long railway journey .
Parsing [sent. 715 len. 62]: The parliamentary clock had a peculiarity which I was not aware of at the time -- a peculiarity which exists in no other clock , and would not exist in that one if it had been made by a sane person ; on the half-hour it strikes the succeeding hour , then strikes the hour again , at the proper time .
Parsing [sent. 716 len. 39]: I lay reading and smoking awhile ; then , when I could hold my eyes open no longer and was about to put out the light , the great clock began to boom , and I counted ten .
Parsing [sent. 717 len. 13]: I reached for the Waterbury to see how it was getting along .
Parsing [sent. 718 len. 5]: It was marking 9.30 .
Parsing [sent. 719 len. 20]: It seemed rather poor speed for a three-dollar watch , but I supposed that the climate was affecting it .
Parsing [sent. 720 len. 21]: I shoved it half an hour ahead ; and took to my book and waited to see what would happen .
Parsing [sent. 721 len. 9]: At 10 the great clock struck ten again .
Parsing [sent. 722 len. 10]: I looked -- the Waterbury was marking half-past 10 .
Parsing [sent. 723 len. 14]: This was too much speed for the money , and it troubled me .
Parsing [sent. 724 len. 32]: I pushed the hands back a half hour , and waited once more ; I had to , for I was vexed and restless now , and my sleepiness was gone .
Parsing [sent. 725 len. 9]: By and by the great clock struck 11 .
Parsing [sent. 726 len. 6]: The Waterbury was marking 10.30 .
Parsing [sent. 727 len. 14]: I pushed it ahead half an hour , with some show of temper .
Parsing [sent. 728 len. 10]: By and by the great clock struck 11 again .
Parsing [sent. 729 len. 18]: The Waterbury showed up 11.30 , now , and I beat her brains out against the bedstead .
Parsing [sent. 730 len. 11]: I was sorry next day , when I found out .
Parsing [sent. 731 len. 6]: To return to the ship .
Parsing [sent. 732 len. 22]: The average human being is a perverse creature ; and when he is n't that , he is a practical joker .
Parsing [sent. 733 len. 21]: The result to the other person concerned is about the same : that is , he is made to suffer .
Parsing [sent. 734 len. 46]: The washing down of the decks begins at a very early hour in all ships ; in but few ships are any measures taken to protect the passengers , either by waking or warning them , or by sending a steward to close their ports .
Parsing [sent. 735 len. 13]: And so the deckwashers have their opportunity , and they use it .
Parsing [sent. 736 len. 30]: They send a bucket of water slashing along the side of the ship and into the ports , drenching the passenger 's clothes , and often the passenger himself .
Parsing [sent. 737 len. 58]: This good old custom prevailed in this ship , and under unusually favorable circumstances , for in the blazing tropical regions a removable zinc thing like a sugarshovel projects from the port to catch the wind and bring it in ; this thing catches the wash-water and brings it in , too -- and in flooding abundance .
Parsing [sent. 738 len. 38]: Mrs. I. , an invalid , had to sleep on the locker -- sofa under her port , and every time she over-slept and thus failed to take care of herself , the deck-washers drowned her out .
Parsing [sent. 739 len. 11]: And the painters , what a good time they had !
Parsing [sent. 740 len. 30]: This ship would be going into dock for a month in Sydney for repairs ; but no matter , painting was going on all the time somewhere or other .
Parsing [sent. 741 len. 17]: The ladies ' dresses were constantly getting ruined , nevertheless protests and supplications went for nothing .
Parsing [sent. 742 len. 55]: Sometimes a lady , taking an afternoon nap on deck near a ventilator or some other thing that did n't need painting , would wake up by and by and find that the humorous painter had been noiselessly daubing that thing and had splattered her white gown all over with little greasy yellow spots .
Parsing [sent. 743 len. 19]: The blame for this untimely painting did not lie with the ship 's officers , but with custom .
Parsing [sent. 744 len. 48]: As far back as Noah 's time it became law that ships must be constantly painted and fussed at when at sea ; custom grew out of the law , and at sea custom knows no death ; this custom will continue until the sea goes dry .
Parsing [sent. 745 len. 3]: Sept. 8 .
Parsing [sent. 746 len. 3]: -- Sunday .
Parsing [sent. 747 len. 18]: We are moving so nearly south that we cross only about two meridians of longitude a day .
Parsing [sent. 748 len. 19]: This morning we were in longitude 178 west from Greenwich , and 57 degrees west from San Francisco .
Parsing [sent. 749 len. 25]: To-morrow we shall be close to the center of the globe -- the 180th degree of west longitude and 180th degree of east longitude .
Parsing [sent. 750 len. 23]: And then we must drop out a day-lose a day out of our lives , a day never to be found again .
Parsing [sent. 751 len. 19]: We shall all die one day earlier than from the beginning of time we were foreordained to die .
Parsing [sent. 752 len. 10]: We shall be a day behindhand all through eternity .
Parsing [sent. 753 len. 35]: We shall always be saying to the other angels , `` Fine day today , '' and they will be always retorting , `` But it is n't to-day , it 's tomorrow . ''
Parsing [sent. 754 len. 20]: We shall be in a state of confusion all the time and shall never know what true happiness is .
Parsing [sent. 755 len. 3]: Next Day .
Parsing [sent. 756 len. 7]: Sure enough , it has happened .
Parsing [sent. 757 len. 27]: Yesterday it was September 8 , Sunday ; to-day , per the bulletin-board at the head of the companionway , it is September 10 , Tuesday .
Parsing [sent. 758 len. 7]: There is something uncanny about it .
Parsing [sent. 759 len. 3]: And uncomfortable .
Parsing [sent. 760 len. 17]: In fact , nearly unthinkable , and wholly unrealizable , when one comes to consider it .
Parsing [sent. 761 len. 30]: While we were crossing the 180th meridian it was Sunday in the stern of the ship where my family were , and Tuesday in the bow where I was .
Parsing [sent. 762 len. 42]: They were there eating the half of a fresh apple on the 8th , and I was at the same time eating the other half of it on the 10th -- and I could notice how stale it was , already .
Parsing [sent. 763 len. 30]: The family were the same age that they were when I had left them five minutes before , but I was a day older now than I was then .
Parsing [sent. 764 len. 43]: The day they were living in stretched behind them half way round the globe , across the Pacific Ocean and America and Europe ; the day I was living in stretched in front of me around the other half to meet it .
Parsing [sent. 765 len. 21]: They were stupendous days for bulk and stretch ; apparently much larger days than we had ever been in before .
Parsing [sent. 766 len. 12]: All previous days had been but shrunk-up little things by comparison .
Parsing [sent. 767 len. 26]: The difference in temperature between the two days was very marked , their day being hotter than mine because it was closer to the equator .
Parsing [sent. 768 len. 34]: Along about the moment that we were crossing the Great Meridian a child was born in the steerage , and now there is no way to tell which day it was born on .
Parsing [sent. 769 len. 14]: The nurse thinks it was Sunday , the surgeon thinks it was Tuesday .
Parsing [sent. 770 len. 9]: The child will never know its own birthday .
Parsing [sent. 771 len. 24]: It will always be choosing first one and then the other , and will never be able to make up its mind permanently .
Parsing [sent. 772 len. 49]: This will breed vacillation and uncertainty in its opinions about religion , and politics , and business , and sweethearts , and everything , and will undermine its principles , and rot them away , and make the poor thing characterless , and its success in life impossible .
Parsing [sent. 773 len. 8]: Every one in the ship says so .
Parsing [sent. 774 len. 13]: And this is not all -- in fact , not the worst .
Parsing [sent. 775 len. 42]: For there is an enormously rich brewer in the ship who said as much as ten days ago , that if the child was born on his birthday he would give it ten thousand dollars to start its little life with .
Parsing [sent. 776 len. 10]: His birthday was Monday , the 9th of September .
Parsing [sent. 777 len. 49]: If the ships all moved in the one direction -- westward , I mean -- the world would suffer a prodigious loss -- in the matter of valuable time , through the dumping overboard on the Great Meridian of such multitudes of days by ships crews and passengers .
Parsing [sent. 778 len. 16]: But fortunately the ships do not all sail west , half of them sail east .
Parsing [sent. 779 len. 7]: So there is no real loss .
Parsing [sent. 780 len. 36]: These latter pick up all the discarded days and add them to the world 's stock again ; and about as good as new , too ; for of course the salt water preserves them .
Parsing [sent. 781 len. 6]: CHAPTER V. Noise proves nothing .
Parsing [sent. 782 len. 18]: Often a hen who has merely laid an egg cackles as if she had laid an asteroid .
Parsing [sent. 783 len. 9]: -- Pudd ` nhead Wilson 's New Calendar .
Parsing [sent. 784 len. 5]: WEDNESDAY , Sept. 11 .
Parsing [sent. 785 len. 10]: In this world we often make mistakes of judgment .
Parsing [sent. 786 len. 19]: We do not as a rule get out of them sound and whole , but sometimes we do .
Parsing [sent. 787 len. 32]: At dinner yesterday evening-present , a mixture of Scotch , English , American , Canadian , and Australasian folk -- a discussion broke out about the pronunciation of certain Scottish words .
Parsing [sent. 788 len. 18]: This was private ground , and the non-Scotch nationalities , with one exception , discreetly kept still .
Parsing [sent. 789 len. 12]: But I am not discreet , and I took a hand .
Parsing [sent. 790 len. 21]: I did n't know anything about the subject , but I took a hand just to have something to do .
Parsing [sent. 791 len. 12]: At that moment the word in dispute was the word three .
Parsing [sent. 792 len. 29]: One Scotchman was claiming that the peasantry of Scotland pronounced it three , his adversaries claimed that they did n't -- that they pronounced it ` thraw ' .
Parsing [sent. 793 len. 22]: The solitary Scot was having a sultry time of it , so I thought I would enrich him with my help .
Parsing [sent. 794 len. 29]: In my position I was necessarily quite impartial , and was equally as well and as ill equipped to fight on the one side as on the other .
Parsing [sent. 795 len. 16]: So I spoke up and said the peasantry pronounced the word three , not thraw .
Parsing [sent. 796 len. 7]: It was an error of judgment .
Parsing [sent. 797 len. 14]: There was a moment of astonished and ominous silence , then weather ensued .
Parsing [sent. 798 len. 21]: The storm rose and spread in a surprising way , and I was snowed under in a very few minutes .
Parsing [sent. 799 len. 13]: It was a bad defeat for me -- a kind of Waterloo .
Parsing [sent. 800 len. 23]: It promised to remain so , and I wished I had had better sense than to enter upon such a forlorn enterprise .
Parsing [sent. 801 len. 18]: But just then I had a saving thought -- at least a thought that offered a chance .
Parsing [sent. 802 len. 31]: While the storm was still raging , I made up a Scotch couplet , and then spoke up and said : `` Very well , do n't say any more .
Parsing [sent. 803 len. 4]: I confess defeat .
Parsing [sent. 804 len. 11]: I thought I knew , but I see my mistake .
Parsing [sent. 805 len. 11]: I was deceived by one of your Scotch poets . ''
Parsing [sent. 806 len. 5]: `` A Scotch poet !
Parsing [sent. 807 len. 3]: O come !
Parsing [sent. 808 len. 4]: Name him . ''
Parsing [sent. 809 len. 5]: `` Robert Burns . ''
Parsing [sent. 810 len. 9]: It is wonderful the power of that name .
Parsing [sent. 811 len. 12]: These men looked doubtful -- but paralyzed , all the same .
Parsing [sent. 812 len. 35]: They were quite silent for a moment ; then one of them said -- with the reverence in his voice which is always present in a Scotchman 's tone when he utters the name .
Parsing [sent. 813 len. 12]: `` Does Robbie Burns say -- what does he say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 814 len. 28]: `` This is what he says : ` There were nae bairns but only three -- Ane at the breast , twa at the knee . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 815 len. 5]: It ended the discussion .
Parsing [sent. 816 len. 24]: There was no man there profane enough , disloyal enough , to say any word against a thing which Robert Burns had settled .
Parsing [sent. 817 len. 21]: I shall always honor that great name for the salvation it brought me in this time of my sore need .
Parsing [sent. 818 len. 21]: It is my belief that nearly any invented quotation , played with confidence , stands a good chance to deceive .
Parsing [sent. 819 len. 13]: There are people who think that honesty is always the best policy .
Parsing [sent. 820 len. 19]: This is a superstition ; there are times when the appearance of it is worth six of it .
Parsing [sent. 821 len. 17]: We are moving steadily southward-getting further and further down under the projecting paunch of the globe .
Parsing [sent. 822 len. 21]: Yesterday evening we saw the Big Dipper and the north star sink below the horizon and disappear from our world .
Parsing [sent. 823 len. 10]: No , not `` we , '' but they .
Parsing [sent. 824 len. 14]: They saw it -- somebody saw it -- and told me about it .
Parsing [sent. 825 len. 23]: But it is no matter , I was not caring for those things , I am tired of them , any way .
Parsing [sent. 826 len. 17]: I think they are well enough , but one does n't want them always hanging around .
Parsing [sent. 827 len. 9]: My interest was all in the Southern Cross .
Parsing [sent. 828 len. 6]: I had never seen that .
Parsing [sent. 829 len. 23]: I had heard about it all my life , and it was but natural that I should be burning to see it .
Parsing [sent. 830 len. 8]: No other constellation makes so much talk .
Parsing [sent. 831 len. 53]: I had nothing against the Big Dipper -- and naturally could n't have anything against it , since it is a citizen of our own sky , and the property of the United States -- but I did want it to move out of the way and give this foreigner a chance .
Parsing [sent. 832 len. 25]: Judging by the size of the talk which the Southern Cross had made , I supposed it would need a sky all to itself .
Parsing [sent. 833 len. 6]: But that was a mistake .
Parsing [sent. 834 len. 12]: We saw the Cross to-night , and it is not large .
Parsing [sent. 835 len. 8]: Not large , and not strikingly bright .
Parsing [sent. 836 len. 22]: But it was low down toward the horizon , and it may improve when it gets up higher in the sky .
Parsing [sent. 837 len. 21]: It is ingeniously named , for it looks just as a cross would look if it looked like something else .
Parsing [sent. 838 len. 18]: But that description does not describe ; it is too vague , too general , too indefinite .
Parsing [sent. 839 len. 26]: It does after a fashion suggest a cross -- a cross that is out of repair -- or out of drawing ; not correctly shaped .
Parsing [sent. 840 len. 20]: It is long , with a short cross-bar , and the cross-bar is canted out of the straight line .
Parsing [sent. 841 len. 11]: It consists of four large stars and one little one .
Parsing [sent. 842 len. 13]: The little one is out of line and further damages the shape .
Parsing [sent. 843 len. 15]: It should have been placed at the intersection of the stem and the cross-bar .
Parsing [sent. 844 len. 24]: If you do not draw an imaginary line from star to star it does not suggest a cross -- nor anything in particular .
Parsing [sent. 845 len. 19]: One must ignore the little star , and leave it out of the combination -- it confuses everything .
Parsing [sent. 846 len. 42]: If you leave it out , then you can make out of the four stars a sort of cross -- out of true ; or a sort of kite -- out of true ; or a sort of coffin-out of true .
Parsing [sent. 847 len. 9]: Constellations have always been troublesome things to name .
Parsing [sent. 848 len. 35]: If you give one of them a fanciful name , it will always refuse to live up to it ; it will always persist in not resembling the thing it has been named for .
Parsing [sent. 849 len. 24]: Ultimately , to satisfy the public , the fanciful name has to be discarded for a common-sense one , a manifestly descriptive one .
Parsing [sent. 850 len. 68]: The Great Bear remained the Great Bear -- and unrecognizable as such -- for thousands of years ; and people complained about it all the time , and quite properly ; but as soon as it became the property of the United States , Congress changed it to the Big Dipper , and now every body is satisfied , and there is no more talk about riots .
Parsing [sent. 851 len. 45]: I would not change the Southern Cross to the Southern Coffin , I would change it to the Southern Kite ; for up there in the general emptiness is the proper home of a kite , but not for coffins and crosses and dippers .
Parsing [sent. 852 len. 34]: In a little while , now -- I can not tell exactly how long it will be -- the globe will belong to the English-speaking race ; and of course the skies also .
Parsing [sent. 853 len. 42]: Then the constellations will be re-organized , and polished up , and re-named -- the most of them `` Victoria , '' I reckon , but this one will sail thereafter as the Southern Kite , or go out of business .
Parsing [sent. 854 len. 17]: Several towns and things , here and there , have been named for Her Majesty already .
Parsing [sent. 855 len. 16]: In these past few days we are plowing through a mighty Milky Way of islands .
Parsing [sent. 856 len. 27]: They are so thick on the map that one would hardly expect to find room between them for a canoe ; yet we seldom glimpse one .
Parsing [sent. 857 len. 27]: Once we saw the dim bulk of a couple of them , far away , spectral and dreamy things ; members of the Horne-Alofa and Fortuna .
Parsing [sent. 858 len. 17]: On the larger one are two rival native kings -- and they have a time together .
Parsing [sent. 859 len. 9]: They are Catholics ; so are their people .
Parsing [sent. 860 len. 7]: The missionaries there are French priests .
Parsing [sent. 861 len. 28]: From the multitudinous islands in these regions the `` recruits '' for the Queensland plantations were formerly drawn ; are still drawn from them , I believe .
Parsing [sent. 862 len. 23]: Vessels fitted up like old-time slavers came here and carried off the natives to serve as laborers in the great Australian province .
Parsing [sent. 863 len. 17]: In the beginning it was plain , simple man-stealing , as per testimony of the missionaries .
Parsing [sent. 864 len. 9]: This has been denied , but not disproven .
Parsing [sent. 865 len. 55]: Afterward it was forbidden by law to `` recruit '' a native without his consent , and governmental agents were sent in all recruiting vessels to see that the law was obeyed -- which they did , according to the recruiting people ; and which they sometimes did n't , according to the missionaries .
Parsing [sent. 866 len. 36]: A man could be lawfully recruited for a three-years term of service ; he could volunteer for another term if he so chose ; when his time was up he could return to his island .
Parsing [sent. 867 len. 33]: And would also have the means to do it ; for the government required the employer to put money in its hands for this purpose before the recruit was delivered to him .
Parsing [sent. 868 len. 10]: Captain Wawn was a recruiting ship-master during many years .
Parsing [sent. 869 len. 23]: From his pleasant book one gets the idea that the recruiting business was quite popular with the islanders , as a rule .
Parsing [sent. 870 len. 68]: And yet that did not make the business wholly dull and uninteresting ; for one finds rather frequent little breaks in the monotony of it -- like this , for instance : `` The afternoon of our arrival at Leper Island the schooner was lying almost becalmed under the lee of the lofty central portion of the island , about three-quarters of a mile from the shore .
Parsing [sent. 871 len. 9]: The boats were in sight at some distance .
Parsing [sent. 872 len. 29]: The recruiter-boat had run into a small nook on the rocky coast , under a high bank , above which stood a solitary hut backed by dense forest .
Parsing [sent. 873 len. 17]: The government agent and mate in the second boat lay about 400 yards to the westward .
Parsing [sent. 874 len. 32]: `` Suddenly we heard the sound of firing , followed by yells from the natives on shore , and then we saw the recruiter-boat push out with a seemingly diminished crew .
Parsing [sent. 875 len. 29]: The mate 's boat pulled quickly up , took her in tow , and presently brought her alongside , all her own crew being more or less hurt .
Parsing [sent. 876 len. 15]: It seems the natives had called them into the place on pretence of friendship .
Parsing [sent. 877 len. 18]: A crowd gathered about the stern of the boat , and several fellows even got into her .
Parsing [sent. 878 len. 13]: All of a sudden our men were attacked with clubs and tomahawks .
Parsing [sent. 879 len. 25]: The recruiter escaped the first blows aimed at him , making play with his fists until he had an opportunity to draw his revolver .
Parsing [sent. 880 len. 30]: ` Tom Sayers , ' a Mare man , received a tomahawk blow on the head which laid the scalp open but did not penetrate his skull , fortunately .
Parsing [sent. 881 len. 38]: ` Bobby Towns , ' another Mare boatman , had both his thumbs cut in warding off blows , one of them being so nearly severed from the hand that the doctors had to finish the operation .
Parsing [sent. 882 len. 24]: Lihu , a Lifu boy , the recruiter 's special attendant , was cut and pricked in various places , but nowhere seriously .
Parsing [sent. 883 len. 53]: Jack , an unlucky Tanna recruit , who had been engaged to act as boatman , received an arrow through his forearm , the head of which -- apiece of bone seven or eight inches long -- was still in the limb , protruding from both sides , when the boats returned .
Parsing [sent. 884 len. 30]: The recruiter himself would have got off scot-free had not an arrow pinned one of his fingers to the loom of the steering-oar just as they were getting off .
Parsing [sent. 885 len. 8]: The fight had been short but sharp .
Parsing [sent. 886 len. 11]: The enemy lost two men , both shot dead . ''
Parsing [sent. 887 len. 64]: The truth is , Captain Wawn furnishes such a crowd of instances of fatal encounters between natives and French and English recruiting-crews -LRB- for the French are in the business for the plantations of New Caledonia -RRB- , that one is almost persuaded that recruiting is not thoroughly popular among the islanders ; else why this bristling string of attacks and bloodcurdling slaughter ?
Parsing [sent. 888 len. 12]: The captain lays it all to `` Exeter Hall influence . ''
Parsing [sent. 889 len. 41]: But for the meddling philanthropists , the native fathers and mothers would be fond of seeing their children carted into exile and now and then the grave , instead of weeping about it and trying to kill the kind recruiters .
Parsing [sent. 890 len. 3]: CHAPTER VI .
Parsing [sent. 891 len. 15]: He was as shy as a newspaper is when referring to its own merits .
Parsing [sent. 892 len. 9]: -- Pudd ` nhead Wilson 's New Calendar .
Parsing [sent. 893 len. 15]: Captain Wawn is crystal-clear on one point : He does not approve of missionaries .
Parsing [sent. 894 len. 5]: They obstruct his business .
Parsing [sent. 895 len. 39]: They make `` Recruiting , '' as he calls it -LRB- `` Slave-Catching , '' as they call it in their frank way -RRB- a trouble when it ought to be just a picnic and a pleasure excursion .
Parsing [sent. 896 len. 57]: The missionaries have their opinion about the manner in which the Labor Traffic is conducted , and about the recruiter 's evasions of the law of the Traffic , and about the traffic itself -- and it is distinctly uncomplimentary to the Traffic and to everything connected with it , including the law for its regulation .
Parsing [sent. 897 len. 54]: Captain Wawn 's book is of very recent date ; I have by me a pamphlet of still later date -- hot from the press , in fact -- by Rev. Wm. Gray , a missionary ; and the book and the pamphlet taken together make exceedingly interesting reading , to my mind .
Parsing [sent. 898 len. 18]: Interesting , and easy to understand -- except in one detail , which I will mention presently .
Parsing [sent. 899 len. 20]: It is easy to understand why the Queensland sugar planter should want the Kanaka recruit : he is cheap .
Parsing [sent. 900 len. 6]: Very cheap , in fact .
Parsing [sent. 901 len. 101]: These are the figures paid by the planter : L20 to the recruiter for getting the Kanaka or `` catching '' him , as the missionary phrase goes ; L3 to the Queensland government for `` superintending '' the importation ; L5 deposited with the Government for the Kanaka 's passage home when his three years are up , in case he shall live that long ; about L25 to the Kanaka himself for three years ' wages and clothing ; total payment for the use of a man three years , L53 ; or , including diet , L60 .
Parsing [sent. 902 len. 8]: Altogether , a hundred dollars a year .
Parsing [sent. 903 len. 49]: One can understand why the recruiter is fond of the business ; the recruit costs him a few cheap presents -LRB- given to the recruit 's relatives , not to the recruit himself -RRB- , and the recruit is worth L20 to the recruiter when delivered in Queensland .
Parsing [sent. 904 len. 26]: All this is clear enough ; but the thing that is not clear is , what there is about it all to persuade the recruit .
Parsing [sent. 905 len. 51]: He is young and brisk ; life at home in his beautiful island is one lazy , long holiday to him ; or if he wants to work he can turn out a couple of bags of copra per week and sell it for four or five shillings a bag .
Parsing [sent. 906 len. 43]: In Queensland he must get up at dawn and work from eight to twelve hours a day in the canefields -- in a much hotter climate than he is used to -- and get less than four shillings a week for it .
Parsing [sent. 907 len. 11]: I can not understand his willingness to go to Queensland .
Parsing [sent. 908 len. 8]: It is a deep puzzle to me .
Parsing [sent. 909 len. 45]: Here is the explanation , from the planter 's point of view ; at least I gather from the missionary 's pamphlet that it is the planter 's : `` When he comes from his home he is a savage , pure and simple .
Parsing [sent. 910 len. 12]: He feels no shame at his nakedness and want of adornment .
Parsing [sent. 911 len. 24]: When he returns home he does so well dressed , sporting a Waterbury watch , collars , cuffs , boots , and jewelry .
Parsing [sent. 912 len. 19]: He takes with him one or more boxes -- -LSB- `` Box '' is English for trunk . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 913 len. 26]: -- well filled with clothing , a musical instrument or two , and perfumery and other articles of luxury he has learned to appreciate . ''
Parsing [sent. 914 len. 28]: For just one moment we have a seeming flash of comprehension of , the Kanaka 's reason for exiling himself : he goes away to acquire civilization .
Parsing [sent. 915 len. 68]: Yes , he was naked and not ashamed , now he is clothed and knows how to be ashamed ; he was unenlightened ; now he has a Waterbury watch ; he was unrefined , now he has jewelry , and something to make him smell good ; he was a nobody , a provincial , now he has been to far countries and can show off .
Parsing [sent. 916 len. 9]: It all looks plausible -- for a moment .
Parsing [sent. 917 len. 25]: Then the missionary takes hold of this explanation and pulls it to pieces , and dances on it , and damages it beyond recognition .
Parsing [sent. 918 len. 48]: `` Admitting that the foregoing description is the average one , the average sequel is this : The cuffs and collars , if used at all , are carried off by youngsters , who fasten them round the leg , just below the knee , as ornaments .
Parsing [sent. 919 len. 40]: The Waterbury , broken and dirty , finds its way to the trader , who gives a trifle for it ; or the inside is taken out , the wheels strung on a thread and hung round the neck .
Parsing [sent. 920 len. 22]: Knives , axes , calico , and handkerchiefs are divided among friends , and there is hardly one of these apiece .
Parsing [sent. 921 len. 18]: The boxes , the keys often lost on the road home , can be bought for 2s .
Parsing [sent. 922 len. 2]: 6d .
Parsing [sent. 923 len. 15]: They are to be seen rotting outside in almost any shore village on Tanna .
Parsing [sent. 924 len. 10]: -LRB- I speak of what I have seen . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 925 len. 25]: A returned Kanaka has been furiously angry with me because I would not buy his trousers , which he declared were just my fit .
Parsing [sent. 926 len. 13]: He sold them afterwards to one of my Aniwan teachers for 9d .
Parsing [sent. 927 len. 14]: worth of tobacco -- a pair of trousers that probably cost him 8s .
Parsing [sent. 928 len. 3]: or 10s .
Parsing [sent. 929 len. 3]: in Queensland .
Parsing [sent. 930 len. 10]: A coat or shirt is handy for cold weather .
Parsing [sent. 931 len. 23]: The white handkerchiefs , the ` senet ' -LRB- perfumery -RRB- , the umbrella , and perhaps the hat , are kept .
Parsing [sent. 932 len. 19]: The boots have to take their chance , if they do not happen to fit the copra trader .
Parsing [sent. 933 len. 55]: ` Senet ' on the hair , streaks of paint on the face , a dirty white handkerchief round the neck , strips of turtle shell in the ears , a belt , a sheath and knife , and an umbrella constitute the rig of returned Kanaka at home the day after landing . ''
Parsing [sent. 934 len. 12]: A hat , an umbrella , a belt , a neckerchief .
Parsing [sent. 935 len. 4]: Otherwise stark naked .
Parsing [sent. 936 len. 15]: All in a day the hard-earned `` civilization '' has melted away to this .
Parsing [sent. 937 len. 9]: And even these perishable things must presently go .
Parsing [sent. 938 len. 32]: Indeed , there is but a single detail of his civilization that can be depended on to stay by him : according to the missionary , he has learned to swear .
Parsing [sent. 939 len. 14]: This is art , and art is long , as the poet says .
Parsing [sent. 940 len. 11]: In all countries the laws throw light upon the past .
Parsing [sent. 941 len. 14]: The Queensland law for the regulation of the Labor Traffic is a confession .
Parsing [sent. 942 len. 31]: It is a confession that the evils charged by the missionaries upon the traffic had existed in the past , and that they still existed when the law was made .
Parsing [sent. 943 len. 28]: The missionaries make a further charge : that the law is evaded by the recruiters , and that the Government Agent sometimes helps them to do it .
Parsing [sent. 944 len. 75]: Regulation 31 reveals two things : that sometimes a young fool of a recruit gets his senses back , after being persuaded to sign away his liberty for three years , and dearly wants to get out of the engagement and stay at home with his own people ; and that threats , intimidation , and force are used to keep him on board the recruiting-ship , and to hold him to his contract .
Parsing [sent. 945 len. 6]: Regulation 31 forbids these coercions .
Parsing [sent. 946 len. 35]: The law requires that he shall be allowed to go free ; and another clause of it requires the recruiter to set him ashore -- per boat , because of the prevalence of sharks .
Parsing [sent. 947 len. 18]: Testimony from Rev. Mr. Gray : `` There are ` wrinkles ' for taking the penitent Kanaka .
Parsing [sent. 948 len. 15]: My first experience of the Traffic was a case of this kind in 1884 .
Parsing [sent. 949 len. 34]: A vessel anchored just out of sight of our station , word was brought to me that some boys were stolen , and the relatives wished me to go and get them back .
Parsing [sent. 950 len. 26]: The facts were , as I found , that six boys had recruited , had rushed into the boat , the Government Agent informed me .
Parsing [sent. 951 len. 22]: They had all ` signed ' ; and , said the Government Agent , ` on board they shall remain . '
Parsing [sent. 952 len. 15]: I was assured that the six boys were of age and willing to go .
Parsing [sent. 953 len. 22]: Yet on getting ready to leave the ship I found four of the lads ready to come ashore in the boat !
Parsing [sent. 954 len. 4]: This I forbade .
Parsing [sent. 955 len. 16]: One of them jumped into the water and persisted in coming ashore in my boat .
Parsing [sent. 956 len. 33]: When appealed to , the Government Agent suggested that we go and leave him to be picked up by the ship 's boat , a quarter mile distant at the time ! ''
Parsing [sent. 957 len. 48]: The law and the missionaries feel for the repentant recruit -- and properly , one may be permitted to think , for he is only a youth and ignorant and persuadable to his hurt -- but sympathy for him is not kept in stock by the recruiter .
Parsing [sent. 958 len. 22]: Rev. Mr. Gray says : `` A captain many years in the traffic explained to me how a penitent could betaken .
Parsing [sent. 959 len. 25]: ` When a boy jumps overboard we just take a boat and pull ahead of him , then lie between him and the shore .
Parsing [sent. 960 len. 21]: If he has not tired himself swimming , and passes the boat , keep on heading him in this way .
Parsing [sent. 961 len. 5]: The dodge rarely fails .
Parsing [sent. 962 len. 23]: The boy generally tires of swimming , gets into the boat of his own accord , and goes quietly on board . ''
Parsing [sent. 963 len. 11]: Yes , exhaustion is likely to make a boy quiet .
Parsing [sent. 964 len. 53]: If the distressed boy had been the speaker 's son , and the captors savages , the speaker would have been surprised to see how differently the thing looked from the new point of view ; however , it is not our custom to put ourselves in the other person 's place .
Parsing [sent. 965 len. 13]: Somehow there is something pathetic about that disappointed young savage 's resignation .
Parsing [sent. 966 len. 31]: I must explain , here , that in the traffic dialect , `` boy '' does not always mean boy ; it means a youth above sixteen years of age .
Parsing [sent. 967 len. 25]: That is by Queensland law the age of consent , though it is held that recruiters allow themselves some latitude in guessing at ages .
Parsing [sent. 968 len. 16]: Captain Wawn of the free spirit chafes under the annoyance of `` cast-iron regulations . ''
Parsing [sent. 969 len. 9]: They and the missionaries have poisoned his life .
Parsing [sent. 970 len. 14]: He grieves for the good old days , vanished to come no more .
Parsing [sent. 971 len. 11]: See him weep ; hear him cuss between the lines !
Parsing [sent. 972 len. 91]: `` For a long time we were allowed to apprehend and detain all deserters who had signed the agreement on board ship , but the ` cast-iron ' regulations of the Act of 1884 put a stop to that , allowing the Kanaka to sign the agreement for three years ' service , travel about in the ship in receipt of the regular rations , cadge all he could , and leave when he thought fit , so long as he did not extend his pleasure trip to Queensland . ''
Parsing [sent. 973 len. 14]: Rev. Mr. Gray calls this same restrictive cast-iron law a `` farce . ''
Parsing [sent. 974 len. 21]: `` There is as much cruelty and injustice done to natives by acts that are legal as by deeds unlawful .
Parsing [sent. 975 len. 18]: The regulations that exist are unjust and inadequate -- unjust and inadequate they must ever be . ''
Parsing [sent. 976 len. 17]: He furnishes his reasons for his position , but they are too long for reproduction here .
Parsing [sent. 977 len. 50]: However , if the most a Kanaka advantages himself by a three-years course in civilization in Queensland , is a necklace and an umbrella and a showy imperfection in the art of swearing , it must be that all the profit of the traffic goes to the white man .
Parsing [sent. 978 len. 17]: This could be twisted into a plausible argument that the traffic ought to be squarely abolished .
Parsing [sent. 979 len. 17]: However , there is reason for hope that that can be left alone to achieve itself .
Parsing [sent. 980 len. 20]: It is claimed that the traffic will depopulate its sources of supply within the next twenty or thirty years .
Parsing [sent. 981 len. 27]: Queensland is a very healthy place for white people -- death-rate 12 in 1,000 of the population -- but the Kanaka death-rate is away above that .
Parsing [sent. 982 len. 19]: The vital statistics for 1893 place it at 52 ; for 1894 -LRB- Mackay district -RRB- , 68 .
Parsing [sent. 983 len. 23]: The first six months of the Kanaka 's exile are peculiarly perilous for him because of the rigors of the new climate .
Parsing [sent. 984 len. 16]: The death-rate among the new men has reached as high as 180 in the 1,000 .
Parsing [sent. 985 len. 22]: In the Kanaka 's native home his death-rate is 12 in time of peace , and 15 in time of war .
Parsing [sent. 986 len. 33]: Thus exile to Queensland -- with the opportunity to acquire civilization , an umbrella , and a pretty poor quality of profanity -- is twelve times as deadly for him as war .
Parsing [sent. 987 len. 39]: Common Christian charity , common humanity , does seem to require , not only that these people be returned to their homes , but that war , pestilence , and famine be introduced among them for their preservation .
Parsing [sent. 988 len. 21]: Concerning these Pacific isles and their peoples an eloquent prophet spoke long years ago -- five and fifty years ago .
Parsing [sent. 989 len. 10]: In fact , he spoke a little too early .
Parsing [sent. 990 len. 15]: Prophecy is a good line of business , but it is full of risks .
Parsing [sent. 991 len. 50]: This prophet was the Right Rev. M. Russell , LL.D. , D.C.L. , of Edinburgh : `` Is the tide of civilization to roll only to the foot of the Rocky Mountains , and is the sun of knowledge to set at last in the waves of the Pacific ?
Parsing [sent. 992 len. 53]: No ; the mighty day of four thousand years is drawing to its close ; the sun of humanity has performed its destined course ; but long ere its setting rays are extinguished in the west , its ascending beams have glittered on the isles of the eastern seas . . . .
Parsing [sent. 993 len. 33]: And now we see the race of Japhet setting forth to people the isles , and the seeds of another Europe and a second England sown in the regions of the sun .
Parsing [sent. 994 len. 26]: But mark the words of the prophecy : ` He shall dwell in the tents of Shem , and Canaan shall be his servant . '
Parsing [sent. 995 len. 10]: It is not said Canaan shall be his slave .
Parsing [sent. 996 len. 30]: To the Anglo-Saxon race is given the scepter of the globe , but there is not given either the lash of the slave-driver or the rack of the executioner .
Parsing [sent. 997 len. 69]: The East will not be stained with the same atrocities as the West ; the frightful gangrene of an enthralled race is not to mar the destinies of the family of Japhet in the Oriental world ; humanizing , not destroying , as they advance ; uniting with , not enslaving , the inhabitants with whom they dwell , the British race may , '' etc. , etc. .
Parsing [sent. 998 len. 17]: And he closes his vision with an invocation from Thomson : `` Come , bright Improvement !
Parsing [sent. 999 len. 17]: on the car of Time , And rule the spacious world from clime to clime . ''
Parsing [sent. 1000 len. 47]: Very well , Bright Improvement has arrived , you see , with her civilization , and her Waterbury , and her umbrella , and her third-quality profanity , and her humanizing-not-destroying machinery , and her hundred-and-eighty death-rate , and everything is going along just as handsome !
Parsing [sent. 1001 len. 16]: But the prophet that speaks last has an advantage over the pioneer in the business .
Parsing [sent. 1002 len. 28]: Rev. Mr. Gray says : `` What I am concerned about is that we as a Christian nation should wipe out these races to enrich ourselves . ''
Parsing [sent. 1003 len. 41]: And he closes his pamphlet with a grim Indictment which is as eloquent in its flowerless straightforward English as is the hand-painted rhapsody of the early prophet : `` My indictment of the Queensland-Kanaka Labor Traffic is this `` 1 .
Parsing [sent. 1004 len. 24]: It generally demoralizes and always impoverishes the Kanaka , deprives him of his citizenship , and depopulates the islands fitted to his home .
Parsing [sent. 1005 len. 3]: `` 2 .
Parsing [sent. 1006 len. 25]: It is felt to lower the dignity of the white agricultural laborer in Queensland , and beyond a doubt it lowers his wages there .
Parsing [sent. 1007 len. 3]: `` 3 .
Parsing [sent. 1008 len. 18]: The whole system is fraught with danger to Australia and the islands on the score of health .
Parsing [sent. 1009 len. 3]: `` 4 .
Parsing [sent. 1010 len. 26]: On social and political grounds the continuance of the Queensland Kanaka Labor Traffic must be a barrier to the true federation of the Australian colonies .
Parsing [sent. 1011 len. 3]: `` 5 .
Parsing [sent. 1012 len. 26]: The Regulations under which the Traffic exists in Queensland are inadequate to prevent abuses , and in the nature of things they must remain so .
Parsing [sent. 1013 len. 3]: `` 6 .
Parsing [sent. 1014 len. 17]: The whole system is contrary to the spirit and doctrine of the Gospel of Jesus Christ .
Parsing [sent. 1015 len. 18]: The Gospel requires us to help the weak , but the Kanaka is fleeced and trodden down .
Parsing [sent. 1016 len. 3]: `` 7 .
Parsing [sent. 1017 len. 26]: The bed-rock of this Traffic is that the life and liberty of a black man are of less value than those of a white man .
Parsing [sent. 1018 len. 23]: And a Traffic that has grown out of ` slave-hunting ' will certainly remain to the end not unlike its origin . ''
Parsing [sent. 1019 len. 3]: CHAPTER VII .
Parsing [sent. 1020 len. 9]: Truth is the most valuable thing we have .
Parsing [sent. 1021 len. 5]: Let us economize it .
Parsing [sent. 1022 len. 9]: -- Pudd ` nhead Wilson 's New Calendar .
Parsing [sent. 1023 len. 34]: From Diary : -- For a day or two we have been plowing among an invisible vast wilderness of islands , catching now and then a shadowy glimpse of a member of it .
Parsing [sent. 1024 len. 27]: There does seem to be a prodigious lot of islands this year ; the map of this region is freckled and fly-specked all over with them .
Parsing [sent. 1025 len. 8]: Their number would seem to be uncountable .
Parsing [sent. 1026 len. 16]: We are moving among the Fijis now -- 224 islands and islets in the group .
Parsing [sent. 1027 len. 56]: In front of us , to the west , the wilderness stretches toward Australia , then curves upward to New Guinea , and still up and up to Japan ; behind us , to the east , the wilderness stretches sixty degrees across the wastes of the Pacific ; south of us is New Zealand .
Parsing [sent. 1028 len. 17]: Somewhere or other among these myriads Samoa is concealed , and not discoverable on the map .
Parsing [sent. 1029 len. 38]: Still , if you wish to go there , you will have no trouble about finding it if you follow the directions given by Robert Louis Stevenson to Dr. Conan Doyle and to Mr. J. M. Barrie .
Parsing [sent. 1030 len. 25]: `` You go to America , cross the continent to San Francisco , and then it 's the second turning to the left . ''
Parsing [sent. 1031 len. 17]: To get the full flavor of the joke one must take a glance at the map .
Parsing [sent. 1032 len. 5]: Wednesday , September 11 .
Parsing [sent. 1033 len. 74]: -- Yesterday we passed close to an island or so , and recognized the published Fiji characteristics : a broad belt of clean white coral sand around the island ; back of it a graceful fringe of leaning palms , with native huts nestling cosily among the shrubbery at their bases ; back of these a stretch of level land clothed in tropic vegetation ; back of that , rugged and picturesque mountains .
Parsing [sent. 1034 len. 17]: A detail of the immediate foreground : a mouldering ship perched high up on a reef-bench .
Parsing [sent. 1035 len. 12]: This completes the composition , and makes the picture artistically perfect .
Parsing [sent. 1036 len. 40]: In the afternoon we sighted Suva , the capital of the group , and threaded our way into the secluded little harbor -- a placid basin of brilliant blue and green water tucked snugly in among the sheltering hills .
Parsing [sent. 1037 len. 28]: A few ships rode at anchor in it -- one of them a sailing vessel flying the American flag ; and they said she came from Duluth !
Parsing [sent. 1038 len. 5]: There 's a journey !
Parsing [sent. 1039 len. 31]: Duluth is several thousand miles from the sea , and yet she is entitled to the proud name of Mistress of the Commercial Marine of the United States of America .
Parsing [sent. 1040 len. 21]: There is only one free , independent , unsubsidized American ship sailing the foreign seas , and Duluth owns it .
Parsing [sent. 1041 len. 10]: All by itself that ship is the American fleet .
Parsing [sent. 1042 len. 21]: All by itself it causes the American name and power to be respected in the far regions of the globe .
Parsing [sent. 1043 len. 50]: All by itself it certifies to the world that the most populous civilized nation , in the earth has a just pride in her stupendous stretch of sea-front , and is determined to assert and maintain her rightful place as one of the Great Maritime Powers of the Planet .
Parsing [sent. 1044 len. 27]: All by itself it is making foreign eyes familiar with a Flag which they have not seen before for forty years , outside of the museum .
Parsing [sent. 1045 len. 65]: For what Duluth has done , in building , equipping , and maintaining at her sole expense the American Foreign Commercial Fleet , and in thus rescuing the American name from shame and lifting it high for the homage of the nations , we owe her a debt of gratitude which our hearts shall confess with quickened beats whenever her name is named henceforth .
Parsing [sent. 1046 len. 53]: Many national toasts will die in the lapse of time , but while the flag flies and the Republic survives , they who live under their shelter will still drink this one , standing and uncovered : Health and prosperity to Thee , O Duluth , American Queen of the Alien Seas !
Parsing [sent. 1047 len. 18]: Row-boats began to flock from the shore ; their crews were the first natives we had seen .
Parsing [sent. 1048 len. 19]: These men carried no overplus of clothing , and this was wise , for the weather was hot .
Parsing [sent. 1049 len. 21]: Handsome , great dusky men they were , muscular , clean-limbed , and with faces full of character and intelligence .
Parsing [sent. 1050 len. 18]: It would be hard to find their superiors anywhere among the dark races , I should think .
Parsing [sent. 1051 len. 25]: Everybody went ashore to look around , and spy out the land , and have that luxury of luxuries to sea-voyagers -- a land-dinner .
Parsing [sent. 1052 len. 128]: And there we saw more natives : Wrinkled old women , with their flat mammals flung over their shoulders , or hanging down in front like the cold-weather drip from the molasses-faucet ; plump and smily young girls , blithe and content , easy and graceful , a pleasure to look at ; young matrons , tall , straight , comely , nobly built , sweeping by with chin up , and a gait incomparable for unconscious stateliness and dignity ; majestic young men -- athletes for build and muscle -- clothed in a loose arrangement of dazzling white , with bronze breast and bronze legs naked , and the head a cannon-swab of solid hair combed straight out from the skull and dyed a rich brick-red .
Parsing [sent. 1053 len. 16]: Only sixty years ago they were sunk in darkness ; now they have the bicycle .
Parsing [sent. 1054 len. 87]: We strolled about the streets of the white folks ' little town , and around over the hills by paths and roads among European dwellings and gardens and plantations , and past clumps of hibiscus that made a body blink , the great blossoms were so intensely red ; and by and by we stopped to ask an elderly English colonist a question or two , and to sympathize with him concerning the torrid weather ; but he was surprised , and said : `` This ?
Parsing [sent. 1055 len. 5]: This is not hot .
Parsing [sent. 1056 len. 12]: You ought to be here in the summer time once . ''
Parsing [sent. 1057 len. 15]: `` We supposed that this was summer ; it has the ear-marks of it .
Parsing [sent. 1058 len. 14]: You could take it to almost any country and deceive people with it .
Parsing [sent. 1059 len. 13]: But if it is n't summer , what does it lack ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1060 len. 7]: `` It lacks half a year .
Parsing [sent. 1061 len. 5]: This is mid-winter . ''
Parsing [sent. 1062 len. 28]: I had been suffering from colds for several months , and a sudden change of season , like this , could hardly fail to do me hurt .
Parsing [sent. 1063 len. 6]: It brought on another cold .
Parsing [sent. 1064 len. 12]: It is odd , these sudden jumps from season to season .
Parsing [sent. 1065 len. 27]: A fortnight ago we left America in mid-summer , now it is midwinter ; about a week hence we shall arrive in Australia in the spring .
Parsing [sent. 1066 len. 108]: After dinner I found in the billiard-room a resident whom I had known somewhere else in the world , and presently made some new friends and drove with them out into the country to visit his Excellency the head of the State , who was occupying his country residence , to escape the rigors of the winter weather , I suppose , for it was on breezy high ground and much more comfortable than the lower regions , where the town is , and where the winter has full swing , and often sets a person 's hair afire when he takes off his hat to bow .
Parsing [sent. 1067 len. 44]: There is a noble and beautiful view of ocean and islands and castellated peaks from the governor 's high-placed house , and its immediate surroundings lie drowsing in that dreamy repose and serenity which are the charm of life in the Pacific Islands .
Parsing [sent. 1068 len. 27]: One of the new friends who went out there with me was a large man , and I had been admiring his size all the way .
Parsing [sent. 1069 len. 32]: I was still admiring it as he stood by the governor on the veranda , talking ; then the Fijian butler stepped out there to announce tea , and dwarfed him .
Parsing [sent. 1070 len. 18]: Maybe he did not quite dwarf him , but at any rate the contrast was quite striking .
Parsing [sent. 1071 len. 14]: Perhaps that dark giant was a king in a condition of political suspension .
Parsing [sent. 1072 len. 38]: I think that in the talk there on the veranda it was said that in Fiji , as in the Sandwich Islands , native kings and chiefs are of much grander size and build than the commoners .
Parsing [sent. 1073 len. 32]: This man was clothed in flowing white vestments , and they were just the thing for him ; they comported well with his great stature and his kingly port and dignity .
Parsing [sent. 1074 len. 11]: European clothes would have degraded him and made him commonplace .
Parsing [sent. 1075 len. 14]: I know that , because they do that with everybody that wears them .
Parsing [sent. 1076 len. 26]: It was said that the old-time devotion to chiefs and reverence for their persons still survive in the native commoner , and in great force .
Parsing [sent. 1077 len. 42]: The educated young gentleman who is chief of the tribe that live in the region about the capital dresses in the fashion of high-class European gentlemen , but even his clothes can not damn him in the reverence of his people .
Parsing [sent. 1078 len. 26]: Their pride in his lofty rank and ancient lineage lives on , in spite of his lost authority and the evil magic of his tailor .
Parsing [sent. 1079 len. 47]: He has no need to defile himself with work , or trouble his heart with the sordid cares of life ; the tribe will see to it that he shall not want , and that he shall hold up his head and live like a gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 1080 len. 11]: I had a glimpse of him down in the town .
Parsing [sent. 1081 len. 39]: Perhaps he is a descendant of the last king -- the king with the difficult name whose memory is preserved by a notable monument of cut-stone which one sees in the enclosure in the middle of the town .
Parsing [sent. 1082 len. 12]: Thakombau -- I remember , now ; that is the name .
Parsing [sent. 1083 len. 15]: It is easier to preserve it on a granite block than in your head .
Parsing [sent. 1084 len. 11]: Fiji was ceded to England by this king in 1858 .
Parsing [sent. 1085 len. 38]: One of the gentlemen present at the governor 's quoted a remark made by the king at the time of the session -- a neat retort , and with a touch of pathos in it , too .
Parsing [sent. 1086 len. 35]: The English Commissioner had offered a crumb of comfort to Thakombau by saying that the transfer of the kingdom to Great Britain was merely `` a sort of hermit-crab formality , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 1087 len. 28]: `` Yes , '' said poor Thakombau , `` but with this difference -- the crab moves into an unoccupied shell , but mine is n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 1088 len. 33]: However , as far as I can make out from the books , the King was between the devil and the deep sea at the time , and had n't much choice .
Parsing [sent. 1089 len. 25]: He owed the United States a large debt -- a debt which he could pay if allowed time , but time was denied him .
Parsing [sent. 1090 len. 14]: He must pay up right away or the warships would be upon him .
Parsing [sent. 1091 len. 30]: To protect his people from this disaster he ceded his country to Britain , with a clause in the contract providing for the ultimate payment of the American debt .
Parsing [sent. 1092 len. 79]: In old times the Fijians were fierce fighters ; they were very religious , and worshiped idols ; the big chiefs were proud and haughty , and they were men of great style in many ways ; all chiefs had several wives , the biggest chiefs sometimes had as many as fifty ; when a chief was dead and ready for burial , four or five of his wives were strangled and put into the grave with him .
Parsing [sent. 1093 len. 19]: In 1804 twenty-seven British convicts escaped from Australia to Fiji , and brought guns and ammunition with them .
Parsing [sent. 1094 len. 18]: Consider what a power they were , armed like that , and what an opportunity they had .
Parsing [sent. 1095 len. 43]: If they had been energetic men and sober , and had had brains and known how to use them , they could have achieved the sovereignty of the archipelago -LRB----RRB- twenty-seven kings and each with eight or nine islands under his scepter .
Parsing [sent. 1096 len. 7]: But nothing came of this chance .
Parsing [sent. 1097 len. 20]: They lived worthless lives of sin and luxury , and died without honor -- in most cases by violence .
Parsing [sent. 1098 len. 15]: Only one of them had any ambition ; he was an Irishman named Connor .
Parsing [sent. 1099 len. 14]: He tried to raise a family of fifty children , and scored forty-eight .
Parsing [sent. 1100 len. 6]: He died lamenting his failure .
Parsing [sent. 1101 len. 8]: It was a foolish sort of avarice .
Parsing [sent. 1102 len. 11]: Many a father would have been rich enough with forty .
Parsing [sent. 1103 len. 22]: It is a fine race , the Fijians , with brains in their heads , and an inquiring turn of mind .
Parsing [sent. 1104 len. 20]: It appears that their savage ancestors had a doctrine of immortality in their scheme of religion -- with limitations .
Parsing [sent. 1105 len. 24]: That is to say , their dead friend would go to a happy hereafter if he could be accumulated , but not otherwise .
Parsing [sent. 1106 len. 19]: They drew the line ; they thought that the missionary 's doctrine was too sweeping , too comprehensive .
Parsing [sent. 1107 len. 8]: They called his attention to certain facts .
Parsing [sent. 1108 len. 43]: For instance , many of their friends had been devoured by sharks ; the sharks , in their turn , were caught and eaten by other men ; later , these men were captured in war , and eaten by the enemy .
Parsing [sent. 1109 len. 32]: The original persons had entered into the composition of the sharks ; next , they and the sharks had become part of the flesh and blood and bone of the cannibals .
Parsing [sent. 1110 len. 23]: How , then , could the particles of the original men be searched out from the final conglomerate and put together again ?
Parsing [sent. 1111 len. 29]: The inquirers were full of doubts , and considered that the missionary had not examined the matter with the gravity and attention which so serious a thing deserved .
Parsing [sent. 1112 len. 62]: The missionary taught these exacting savages many valuable things , and got from them one -- a very dainty and poetical idea : Those wild and ignorant poor children of Nature believed that the flowers , after they perish , rise on the winds and float away to the fair fields of heaven , and flourish there forever in immortal beauty !
Parsing [sent. 1113 len. 3]: CHAPTER VIII .
Parsing [sent. 1114 len. 21]: It could probably be shown by facts and figures that there is no distinctly native American criminal class except Congress .
Parsing [sent. 1115 len. 9]: -- Pudd ` nhead Wilson 's New Calendar .
Parsing [sent. 1116 len. 50]: When one glances at the map the members of the stupendous island wilderness of the Pacific seem to crowd upon each other ; but no , there is no crowding , even in the center of a group ; and between groups there are lonely wide deserts of sea .
Parsing [sent. 1117 len. 14]: Not everything is known about the islands , their peoples and their languages .
Parsing [sent. 1118 len. 37]: A startling reminder of this is furnished by the fact that in Fiji , twenty years ago , were living two strange and solitary beings who came from an unknown country and spoke an unknown language .
Parsing [sent. 1119 len. 34]: `` They were picked up by a passing vessel many hundreds of miles from any known land , floating in the same tiny canoe in which they had been blown out to sea .
Parsing [sent. 1120 len. 9]: When found they were but skin and bone .
Parsing [sent. 1121 len. 36]: No one could understand what they said , and they have never named their country ; or , if they have , the name does not correspond with that of any island on any chart .
Parsing [sent. 1122 len. 16]: They are now fat and sleek , and as happy as the day is long .
Parsing [sent. 1123 len. 37]: In the ship 's log there is an entry of the latitude and longitude in which they were found , and this is probably all the clue they will ever have to their lost homes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1124 len. 12]: -- -LSB- Forbes 's `` Two Years in Fiji . '' -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 1125 len. 45]: What a strange and romantic episode it is ; and how one is tortured with curiosity to know whence those mysterious creatures came , those Men Without a Country , errant waifs who can not name their lost home , wandering Children of Nowhere .
Parsing [sent. 1126 len. 16]: Indeed , the Island Wilderness is the very home of romance and dreams and mystery .
Parsing [sent. 1127 len. 131]: The loneliness , the solemnity , the beauty , and the deep repose of this wilderness have a charm which is all their own for the bruised spirit of men who have fought and failed in the struggle for life in the great world ; and for men who have been hunted out of the great world for crime ; and for other men who love an easy and indolent existence ; and for others who love a roving free life , and stir and change and adventure ; and for yet others who love an easy and comfortable career of trading and money-getting , mixed with plenty of loose matrimony by purchase , divorce without trial or expense , and limitless spreeing thrown in to make life ideally perfect .
Parsing [sent. 1128 len. 6]: We sailed again , refreshed .
Parsing [sent. 1129 len. 18]: The most cultivated person in the ship was a young Englishman whose home was in New Zealand .
Parsing [sent. 1130 len. 5]: He was a naturalist .
Parsing [sent. 1131 len. 45]: His learning in his specialty was deep and thorough , his interest in his subject amounted to a passion , he had an easy gift of speech ; and so , when he talked about animals it was a pleasure to listen to him .
Parsing [sent. 1132 len. 30]: And profitable , too , though he was sometimes difficult to understand because now and then he used scientific technicalities which were above the reach of some of us .
Parsing [sent. 1133 len. 32]: They were pretty sure to be above my reach , but as he was quite willing to explain them I always made it a point to get him to do it .
Parsing [sent. 1134 len. 39]: I had a fair knowledge of his subject -- layman 's knowledge -- to begin with , but it was his teachings which crystalized it into scientific form and clarity -- in a word , gave it value .
Parsing [sent. 1135 len. 23]: His special interest was the fauna of Australasia , and his knowledge of the matter was as exhaustive as it was accurate .
Parsing [sent. 1136 len. 49]: I already knew a good deal about the rabbits in Australasia and their marvelous fecundity , but in my talks with him I found that my estimate of the great hindrance and obstruction inflicted by the rabbit pest upon traffic and travel was far short of the facts .
Parsing [sent. 1137 len. 41]: He told me that the first pair of rabbits imported into Australasia bred so wonderfully that within six months rabbits were so thick in the land that people had to dig trenches through them to get from town to town .
Parsing [sent. 1138 len. 30]: He told me a great deal about worms , and the kangaroo , and other coleoptera , and said he knew the history and ways of all such pachydermata .
Parsing [sent. 1139 len. 20]: He said the kangaroo had pockets , and carried its young in them when it could n't get apples .
Parsing [sent. 1140 len. 28]: And he said that the emu was as big as an ostrich , and looked like one , and had an amorphous appetite and would eat bricks .
Parsing [sent. 1141 len. 43]: Also , that the dingo was not a dingo at all , but just a wild dog ; and that the only difference between a dingo and a dodo was that neither of them barked ; otherwise they were just the same .
Parsing [sent. 1142 len. 27]: He said that the only game-bird in Australia was the wombat , and the only song-bird the larrikin , and that both were protected by government .
Parsing [sent. 1143 len. 13]: The most beautiful of the native birds was the bird of Paradise .
Parsing [sent. 1144 len. 13]: Next came the two kinds of lyres ; not spelt the same .
Parsing [sent. 1145 len. 14]: He said the one kind was dying out , the other thickening up .
Parsing [sent. 1146 len. 28]: He explained that the `` Sundowner '' was not a bird it was a man ; sundowner was merely the Australian equivalent of our word , tramp .
Parsing [sent. 1147 len. 13]: He is a loafer , a hard drinker , and a sponge .
Parsing [sent. 1148 len. 56]: He tramps across the country in the sheep-shearing season , pretending to look for work ; but he always times himself to arrive at a sheep-run just at sundown , when the day 's labor ends ; all he wants is whisky and supper and bed and breakfast ; he gets them and then disappears .
Parsing [sent. 1149 len. 30]: The naturalist spoke of the bell bird , the creature that at short intervals all day rings out its mellow and exquisite peal from the deeps of the forest .
Parsing [sent. 1150 len. 34]: It is the favorite and best friend of the weary and thirsty sundowner ; for he knows that wherever the bell bird is , there is water ; and he goes somewhere else .
Parsing [sent. 1151 len. 23]: The naturalist said that the oddest bird in Australasia was the Laughing Jackass , and the biggest the now extinct Great Moa .
Parsing [sent. 1152 len. 32]: The Moa stood thirteen feet high , and could step over an ordinary man 's head or kick his hat off ; and his head , too , for that matter .
Parsing [sent. 1153 len. 11]: He said it was wingless , but a swift runner .
Parsing [sent. 1154 len. 7]: The natives used to ride it .
Parsing [sent. 1155 len. 22]: It could make forty miles an hour , and keep it up for four hundred miles and come out reasonably fresh .
Parsing [sent. 1156 len. 23]: It was still in existence when the railway was introduced into New Zealand ; still in existence , and carrying the mails .
Parsing [sent. 1157 len. 21]: The railroad began with the same schedule it has now : two expresses a week-time , twenty miles an hour .
Parsing [sent. 1158 len. 10]: The company exterminated the moa to get the mails .
Parsing [sent. 1159 len. 96]: Speaking of the indigenous coneys and bactrian camels , the naturalist said that the coniferous and bacteriological output of Australasia was remarkable for its many and curious departures from the accepted laws governing these species of tubercles , but that in his opinion Nature 's fondness for dabbling in the erratic was most notably exhibited in that curious combination of bird , fish , amphibian , burrower , crawler , quadruped , and Christian called the Ornithorhynchus -- grotesquest of animals , king of the animalculae of the world for versatility of character and make-up .
Parsing [sent. 1160 len. 17]: Said he : `` You can call it anything you want to , and be right .
Parsing [sent. 1161 len. 236]: It is a fish , for it lives in the river half the time ; it is a land animal , for it resides on the land half the time ; it is an amphibian , since it likes both and does not know which it prefers ; it is a hybernian , for when times are dull and nothing much going on it buries itself under the mud at the bottom of a puddle and hybernates there a couple of weeks at a time ; it is a kind of duck , for it has a duck-bill and four webbed paddles ; it is a fish and quadruped together , for in the water it swims with the paddles and on shore it paws itself across country with them ; it is a kind of seal , for it has a seal 's fur ; it is carnivorous , herbivorous , insectivorous , and vermifuginous , for it eats fish and grass and butterflies , and in the season digs worms out of the mud and devours them ; it is clearly a bird , for it lays eggs , and hatches them ; it is clearly a mammal , for it nurses its young ; and it is manifestly a kind of Christian , for it keeps the Sabbath when there is anybody around , and when there is n't , does n't .
Parsing [sent. 1162 len. 22]: It has all the tastes there are except refined ones , it has all the habits there are except good ones .
Parsing [sent. 1163 len. 12]: `` It is a survival -- a survival of the fittest .
Parsing [sent. 1164 len. 31]: Mr. Darwin invented the theory that goes by that name , but the Ornithorhynchus was the first to put it to actual experiment and prove that it could be done .
Parsing [sent. 1165 len. 13]: Hence it should have as much of the credit as Mr. Darwin .
Parsing [sent. 1166 len. 25]: It was never in the Ark ; you will find no mention of it there ; it nobly stayed out and worked the theory .
Parsing [sent. 1167 len. 17]: Of all creatures in the world it was the only one properly equipped for the test .
Parsing [sent. 1168 len. 88]: The Ark was thirteen months afloat , and all the globe submerged ; no land visible above the flood , no vegetation , no food for a mammal to eat , nor water for a mammal to drink ; for all mammal food was destroyed , and when the pure floods from heaven and the salt oceans of the earth mingled their waters and rose above the mountain tops , the result was a drink which no bird or beast of ordinary construction could use and live .
Parsing [sent. 1169 len. 20]: But this combination was nuts for the Ornithorhynchus , if I may use a term like that without offense .
Parsing [sent. 1170 len. 14]: Its river home had always been salted by the flood-tides of the sea .
Parsing [sent. 1171 len. 13]: On the face of the Noachian deluge innumerable forest trees were floating .
Parsing [sent. 1172 len. 85]: Upon these the Ornithorhynchus voyaged in peace ; voyaged from clime to clime , from hemisphere to hemisphere , in contentment and comfort , in virile interest in the constant change of scene , in humble thankfulness for its privileges , in ever-increasing enthusiasm in the development of the great theory upon whose validity it had staked its life , its fortunes , and its sacred honor , if I may use such expressions without impropriety in connection with an episode of this nature .
Parsing [sent. 1173 len. 15]: `` It lived the tranquil and luxurious life of a creature of independent means .
Parsing [sent. 1174 len. 16]: Of things actually necessary to its existence and its happiness not a detail was wanting .
Parsing [sent. 1175 len. 80]: When it wished to walk , it scrambled along the tree-trunk ; it mused in the shade of the leaves by day , it slept in their shelter by night ; when it wanted the refreshment of a swim , it had it ; it ate leaves when it wanted a vegetable diet , it dug under the bark for worms and grubs ; when it wanted fish it caught them , when it wanted eggs it laid them .
Parsing [sent. 1176 len. 28]: If the grubs gave out in one tree it swam to another ; and as for fish , the very opulence of the supply was an embarrassment .
Parsing [sent. 1177 len. 23]: And finally , when it was thirsty it smacked its chops in gratitude over a blend that would have slain a crocodile .
Parsing [sent. 1178 len. 64]: `` When at last , after thirteen months of travel and research in all the Zones it went aground on a mountain-summit , it strode ashore , saying in its heart , ` Let them that come after me invent theories and dream dreams about the Survival of the Fittest if they like , but I am the first that has done it !
Parsing [sent. 1179 len. 86]: `` This wonderful creature dates back like the kangaroo and many other Australian hydrocephalous invertebrates , to an age long anterior to the advent of man upon the earth ; they date back , indeed , to a time when a causeway hundreds of miles wide , and thousands of miles long , joined Australia to Africa , and the animals of the two countries were alike , and all belonged to that remote geological epoch known to science as the Old Red Grindstone Post-Pleosaurian .
Parsing [sent. 1180 len. 30]: Later the causeway sank under the sea ; subterranean convulsions lifted the African continent a thousand feet higher than it was before , but Australia kept her old level .
Parsing [sent. 1181 len. 40]: In Africa 's new climate the animals necessarily began to develop and shade off into new forms and families and species , but the animals of Australia as necessarily remained stationary , and have so remained until this day .
Parsing [sent. 1182 len. 37]: In the course of some millions of years the African Ornithorhynchus developed and developed and developed , and sluffed off detail after detail of its make-up until at last the creature became wholly disintegrated and scattered .
Parsing [sent. 1183 len. 62]: Whenever you see a bird or a beast or a seal or an otter in Africa you know that he is merely a sorry surviving fragment of that sublime original of whom I have been speaking -- that creature which was everything in general and nothing in particular -- the opulently endowed ' e pluribus unum ' of the animal world .
Parsing [sent. 1184 len. 34]: `` Such is the history of the most hoary , the most ancient , the most venerable creature that exists in the earth today -- Ornithorhynchus Platypus Extraordinariensis -- whom God preserve ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1185 len. 15]: When he was strongly moved he could rise and soar like that with ease .
Parsing [sent. 1186 len. 15]: And not only in the prose form , but in the poetical as well .
Parsing [sent. 1187 len. 30]: He had written many pieces of poetry in his time , and these manuscripts he lent around among the passengers , and was willing to let them be copied .
Parsing [sent. 1188 len. 29]: It seemed to me that the least technical one in the series , and the one which reached the loftiest note , perhaps , was his : INVOCATION .
Parsing [sent. 1189 len. 12]: `` Come forth from thy oozy couch , O Ornithorhynchus dear !
Parsing [sent. 1190 len. 67]: And greet with a cordial claw The stranger that longs to hear `` From thy own own lips the tale Of thy origin all unknown : Thy misplaced bone where flesh should be And flesh where should be bone ; `` And fishy fin where should be paw , And beaver-trowel tail , And snout of beast equip 'd with teeth Where gills ought to prevail .
Parsing [sent. 1191 len. 58]: `` Come , Kangaroo , the good and true Foreshortened as to legs , And body tapered like a churn , And sack marsupial , i ' fegs , `` And tells us why you linger here , Thou relic of a vanished time , When all your friends as fossils sleep , Immortalized in lime ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1192 len. 33]: Perhaps no poet is a conscious plagiarist ; but there seems to be warrant for suspecting that there is no poet who is not at one time or another an unconscious one .
Parsing [sent. 1193 len. 32]: The above verses are indeed beautiful , and , in a way , touching ; but there is a haunting something about them which unavoidably suggests the Sweet Singer of Michigan .
Parsing [sent. 1194 len. 21]: It can hardly be doubted that the author had read the works of that poet and been impressed by them .
Parsing [sent. 1195 len. 34]: It is not apparent that he has borrowed from them any word or yet any phrase , but the style and swing and mastery and melody of the Sweet Singer all are there .
Parsing [sent. 1196 len. 95]: Compare this Invocation with `` Frank Dutton '' -- particularly stanzas first and seventeenth -- and I think the reader will feel convinced that he who wrote the one had read the other : I. `` Frank Dutton was as fine a lad As ever you wish to see , And he was drowned in Pine Island Lake On earth no more will he be , His age was near fifteen years , And he was a motherless boy , He was living with his grandmother When he was drowned , poor boy . ''
Parsing [sent. 1197 len. 2]: XVII .
Parsing [sent. 1198 len. 27]: `` He was drowned on Tuesday afternoon , On Sunday he was found , And the tidings of that drowned boy Was heard for miles around .

Parsing [sent. 1203 len. 9]: It is your human environment that makes climate .
Parsing [sent. 1204 len. 9]: -- Pudd ` nhead Wilson 's New Calendar .
Parsing [sent. 1205 len. 5]: Sept. 15 -- Night .
Parsing [sent. 1206 len. 5]: Close to Australia now .
Parsing [sent. 1207 len. 5]: Sydney 50 miles distant .
Parsing [sent. 1208 len. 6]: That note recalls an experience .
Parsing [sent. 1209 len. 18]: The passengers were sent for , to come up in the bow and see a fine sight .
Parsing [sent. 1210 len. 5]: It was very dark .
Parsing [sent. 1211 len. 34]: One could not follow with the eye the surface of the sea more than fifty yards in any direction it dimmed away and became lost to sight at about that distance from us .
Parsing [sent. 1212 len. 20]: But if you patiently gazed into the darkness a little while , there was a sure reward for you .
Parsing [sent. 1213 len. 94]: Presently , a quarter of a mile away you would see a blinding splash or explosion of light on the water -- a flash so sudden and so astonishingly brilliant that it would make you catch your breath ; then that blotch of light would instantly extend itself and take the corkscrew shape and imposing length of the fabled sea-serpent , with every curve of its body and the `` break '' spreading away from its head , and the wake following behind its tail clothed in a fierce splendor of living fire .
Parsing [sent. 1214 len. 12]: And my , but it was coming at a lightning gait !
Parsing [sent. 1215 len. 26]: Almost before you could think , this monster of light , fifty feet long , would go flaming and storming by , and suddenly disappear .
Parsing [sent. 1216 len. 85]: And out in the distance whence he came you would see another flash ; and another and another and another , and see them turn into sea-serpents on the instant ; and once sixteen flashed up at the same time and came tearing towards us , a swarm of wiggling curves , a moving conflagration , a vision of bewildering beauty , a spectacle of fire and energy whose equal the most of those people will not see again until after they are dead .
Parsing [sent. 1217 len. 10]: It was porpoises -- porpoises aglow with phosphorescent light .
Parsing [sent. 1218 len. 62]: They presently collected in a wild and magnificent jumble under the bows , and there they played for an hour , leaping and frollicking and carrying on , turning summersaults in front of the stem or across it and never getting hit , never making a miscalculation , though the stem missed them only about an inch , as a rule .
Parsing [sent. 1219 len. 30]: They were porpoises of the ordinary length -- eight or ten feet -- but every twist of their bodies sent a long procession of united and glowing curves astern .
Parsing [sent. 1220 len. 32]: That fiery jumble was an enchanting thing to look at , and we stayed out the performance ; one can not have such a show as that twice in a lifetime .
Parsing [sent. 1221 len. 25]: The porpoise is the kitten of the sea ; he never has a serious thought , he cares for nothing but fun and play .
Parsing [sent. 1222 len. 14]: But I think I never saw him at his winsomest until that night .
Parsing [sent. 1223 len. 15]: It was near a center of civilization , and he could have been drinking .
Parsing [sent. 1224 len. 57]: By and by , when we had approached to somewhere within thirty miles of Sydney Heads the great electric light that is posted on one of those lofty ramparts began to show , and in time the little spark grew to a great sun and pierced the firmament of darkness with a far-reaching sword of light .
Parsing [sent. 1225 len. 25]: Sydney Harbor is shut in behind a precipice that extends some miles like a wall , and exhibits no break to the ignorant stranger .
Parsing [sent. 1226 len. 25]: It has a break in the middle , but it makes so little show that even Captain Cook sailed by it without seeing it .
Parsing [sent. 1227 len. 34]: Near by that break is a false break which resembles it , and which used to make trouble for the mariner at night , in the early days before the place was lighted .
Parsing [sent. 1228 len. 27]: It caused the memorable disaster to the Duncan Dunbar , one of the most pathetic tragedies in the history of that pitiless ruffian , the sea .
Parsing [sent. 1229 len. 23]: The ship was a sailing vessel ; a fine and favorite passenger packet , commanded by a popular captain of high reputation .
Parsing [sent. 1230 len. 77]: She was due from England , and Sydney was waiting , and counting the hours ; counting the hours , and making ready to give her a heart-stirring welcome ; for she was bringing back a great company of mothers and daughters , the long-missed light and bloom of life of Sydney homes ; daughters that had been years absent at school , and mothers that had been with them all that time watching over them .
Parsing [sent. 1231 len. 74]: Of all the world only India and Australasia have by custom freighted ships and fleets with their hearts , and know the tremendous meaning of that phrase ; only they know what the waiting is like when this freightage is entrusted to the fickle winds , not steam , and what the joy is like when the ship that is returning this treasure comes safe to port and the long dread is over .
Parsing [sent. 1232 len. 71]: On board the Duncan Dunbar , flying toward Sydney Heads in the waning afternoon , the happy home-comers made busy preparation , for it was not doubted that they would be in the arms of their friends before the day was done ; they put away their sea-going clothes and put on clothes meeter for the meeting , their richest and their loveliest , these poor brides of the grave .
Parsing [sent. 1233 len. 23]: But the wind lost force , or there was a miscalculation , and before the Heads were sighted the darkness came on .
Parsing [sent. 1234 len. 38]: It was said that ordinarily the captain would have made a safe offing and waited for the morning ; but this was no ordinary occasion ; all about him were appealing faces , faces pathetic with disappointment .
Parsing [sent. 1235 len. 14]: So his sympathy moved him to try the dangerous passage in the dark .
Parsing [sent. 1236 len. 15]: He had entered the Heads seventeen times , and believed he knew the ground .
Parsing [sent. 1237 len. 16]: So he steered straight for the false opening , mistaking it for the true one .
Parsing [sent. 1238 len. 15]: He did not find out that he was wrong until it was too late .
Parsing [sent. 1239 len. 7]: There was no saving the ship .
Parsing [sent. 1240 len. 24]: The great seas swept her in and crushed her to splinters and rubbish upon the rock tushes at the base of the precipice .
Parsing [sent. 1241 len. 15]: Not one of all that fair and gracious company was ever seen again alive .
Parsing [sent. 1242 len. 53]: The tale is told to every stranger that passes the spot , and it will continue to be told to all that come , for generations ; but it will never grow old , custom can not stale it , the heart-break that is in it can never perish out of it .
Parsing [sent. 1243 len. 16]: There were two hundred persons in the ship , and but one survived the disaster .
Parsing [sent. 1244 len. 5]: He was a sailor .
Parsing [sent. 1245 len. 35]: A huge sea flung him up the face of the precipice and stretched him on a narrow shelf of rock midway between the top and the bottom , and there he lay all night .
Parsing [sent. 1246 len. 84]: At any other time he would have lain there for the rest of his life , without chance of discovery ; but the next morning the ghastly news swept through Sydney that the Duncan Dunbar had gone down in sight of home , and straightway the walls of the Heads were black with mourners ; and one of these , stretching himself out over the precipice to spy out what might be seen below , discovered this miraculously preserved relic of the wreck .
Parsing [sent. 1247 len. 15]: Ropes were brought and the nearly impossible feat of rescuing the man was accomplished .
Parsing [sent. 1248 len. 38]: He was a person with a practical turn of mind , and he hired a hall in Sydney and exhibited himself at sixpence a head till he exhausted the output of the gold fields for that year .
Parsing [sent. 1249 len. 44]: We entered and cast anchor , and in the morning went oh-ing and ah-ing in admiration up through the crooks and turns of the spacious and beautiful harbor -- a harbor which is the darling of Sydney and the wonder of the world .
Parsing [sent. 1250 len. 22]: It is not surprising that the people are proud of it , nor that they put their enthusiasm into eloquent words .
Parsing [sent. 1251 len. 28]: A returning citizen asked me what I thought of it , and I testified with a cordiality which I judged would be up to the market rate .
Parsing [sent. 1252 len. 9]: I said it was beautiful -- superbly beautiful .
Parsing [sent. 1253 len. 11]: Then by a natural impulse I gave God the praise .
Parsing [sent. 1254 len. 8]: The citizen did not seem altogether satisfied .
Parsing [sent. 1255 len. 50]: He said : `` It is beautiful , of course it 's beautiful -- the Harbor ; but that is n't all of it , it 's only half of it ; Sydney 's the other half , and it takes both of them together to ring the supremacy-bell .
Parsing [sent. 1256 len. 17]: God made the Harbor , and that 's all right ; but Satan made Sydney . ''
Parsing [sent. 1257 len. 17]: Of course I made an apology ; and asked him to convey it to his friend .
Parsing [sent. 1258 len. 10]: He was right about Sydney being half of it .
Parsing [sent. 1259 len. 22]: It would be beautiful without Sydney , but not above half as beautiful as it is now , with Sydney added .
Parsing [sent. 1260 len. 44]: It is shaped somewhat like an oak-leaf -- a roomy sheet of lovely blue water , with narrow off-shoots of water running up into the country on both sides between long fingers of land , high wooden ridges with sides sloped like graves .
Parsing [sent. 1261 len. 32]: Handsome villas are perched here and there on these ridges , snuggling amongst the foliage , and one catches alluring glimpses of them as the ship swims by toward the city .
Parsing [sent. 1262 len. 48]: The city clothes a cluster of hills and a ruffle of neighboring ridges with its undulating masses of masonry , and out of these masses spring towers and spires and other architectural dignities and grandeurs that break the flowing lines and give picturesqueness to the general effect .
Parsing [sent. 1263 len. 32]: The narrow inlets which I have mentioned go wandering out into the land everywhere and hiding themselves in it , and pleasure-launches are always exploring them with picnic parties on board .
Parsing [sent. 1264 len. 25]: It is said by trustworthy people that if you explore them all you will find that you have covered 700 miles of water passage .
Parsing [sent. 1265 len. 22]: But there are liars everywhere this year , and they will double that when their works are in good going order .
Parsing [sent. 1266 len. 10]: October was close at hand , spring was come .
Parsing [sent. 1267 len. 26]: It was really spring -- everybody said so ; but you could have sold it for summer in Canada , and nobody would have suspected .
Parsing [sent. 1268 len. 31]: It was the very weather that makes our home summers the perfection of climatic luxury ; I mean , when you are out in the wood or by the sea .
Parsing [sent. 1269 len. 51]: But these people said it was cool , now -- a person ought to see Sydney in the summer time if he wanted to know what warm weather is ; and he ought to go north ten or fifteen hundred miles if he wanted to know what hot weather is .
Parsing [sent. 1270 len. 15]: They said that away up there toward the equator the hens laid fried eggs .
Parsing [sent. 1271 len. 15]: Sydney is the place to go to get information about other people 's climates .
Parsing [sent. 1272 len. 22]: It seems to me that the occupation of Unbiased Traveler Seeking Information is the pleasantest and most irresponsible trade there is .
Parsing [sent. 1273 len. 15]: The traveler can always find out anything he wants to , merely by asking .
Parsing [sent. 1274 len. 11]: He can get at all the facts , and more .
Parsing [sent. 1275 len. 8]: Everybody helps him , nobody hinders him .
Parsing [sent. 1276 len. 27]: Anybody who has an old fact in stock that is no longer negotiable in the domestic market will let him have it at his own price .
Parsing [sent. 1277 len. 11]: An accumulation of such goods is easily and quickly made .
Parsing [sent. 1278 len. 13]: They cost almost nothing and they bring par in the foreign market .
Parsing [sent. 1279 len. 37]: Travelers who come to America always freight up with the same old nursery tales that their predecessors selected , and they carry them back and always work them off without any trouble in the home market .
Parsing [sent. 1280 len. 79]: If the climates of the world were determined by parallels of latitude , then we could know a place 's climate by its position on the map ; and so we should know that the climate of Sydney was the counterpart of the climate of Columbia , S. C. , and of Little Rock , Arkansas , since Sydney is about the same distance south of the equator that those other towns are north of-it -- thirty-four degrees .
Parsing [sent. 1281 len. 10]: But no , climate disregards the parallels of latitude .
Parsing [sent. 1282 len. 22]: In Arkansas they have a winter ; in Sydney they have the name of it , but not the thing itself .
Parsing [sent. 1283 len. 39]: I have seen the ice in the Mississippi floating past the mouth of the Arkansas river ; and at Memphis , but a little way above , the Mississippi has been frozen over , from bank to bank .
Parsing [sent. 1284 len. 19]: But they have never had a cold spell in Sydney which brought the mercury down to freezing point .
Parsing [sent. 1285 len. 37]: Once in a mid-winter day there , in the month of July , the mercury went down to 36 deg. , and that remains the memorable `` cold day '' in the history of the town .
Parsing [sent. 1286 len. 10]: No doubt Little Rock has seen it below zero .
Parsing [sent. 1287 len. 22]: Once , in Sydney , in mid-summer , about New Year 's Day , the mercury went up to 106 deg .
Parsing [sent. 1288 len. 13]: in the shade , and that is Sydney 's memorable hot day .
Parsing [sent. 1289 len. 15]: That would about tally with Little Rock 's hottest day also , I imagine .
Parsing [sent. 1290 len. 14]: My Sydney figures are taken from a government report , and are trustworthy .
Parsing [sent. 1291 len. 28]: In the matter of summer weather Arkansas has no advantage over Sydney , perhaps , but when it comes to winter weather , that is another affair .
Parsing [sent. 1292 len. 22]: You could cut up an Arkansas winter into a hundred Sydney winters and have enough left for Arkansas and the poor .
Parsing [sent. 1293 len. 29]: The whole narrow , hilly belt of the Pacific side of New South Wales has the climate of its capital -- a mean winter temperature of 54 deg .
Parsing [sent. 1294 len. 9]: and a mean summer one of 71 deg .
Parsing [sent. 1295 len. 13]: It is a climate which can not be improved upon for healthfulness .
Parsing [sent. 1296 len. 8]: But the experts say that 90 deg .
Parsing [sent. 1297 len. 12]: in New South Wales is harder to bear than 112 deg .
Parsing [sent. 1298 len. 22]: in the neighboring colony of Victoria , because the atmosphere of the former is humid , and of the latter dry .
Parsing [sent. 1299 len. 22]: The mean temperature of the southernmost point of New South Wales is the same as that of Nice -- 60 deg .
Parsing [sent. 1300 len. 16]: -- yet Nice is further from the equator by 460 miles than is the former .
Parsing [sent. 1301 len. 18]: But Nature is always stingy of perfect climates ; stingier in the case of Australia than usual .
Parsing [sent. 1302 len. 15]: Apparently this vast continent has a really good climate nowhere but around the edges .
Parsing [sent. 1303 len. 19]: If we look at a map of the world we are surprised to see how big Australia is .
Parsing [sent. 1304 len. 16]: It is about two-thirds as large as the United States was before we added Alaska .
Parsing [sent. 1305 len. 51]: But where as one finds a sufficiently good climate and fertile land almost everywhere in the United States , it seems settled that inside of the Australian border-belt one finds many deserts and in spots a climate which nothing can stand except a few of the hardier kinds of rocks .
Parsing [sent. 1306 len. 9]: In effect , Australia is as yet unoccupied .
Parsing [sent. 1307 len. 98]: If you take a map of the United States and leave the Atlantic sea-board States in their places ; also the fringe of Southern States from Florida west to the Mouth of the Mississippi ; also a narrow , inhabited streak up the Mississippi half-way to its head waters ; also a narrow , inhabited border along the Pacific coast : then take a brushful of paint and obliterate the whole remaining mighty stretch of country that lies between the Atlantic States and the Pacific-coast strip , your map will look like the latest map of Australia .
Parsing [sent. 1308 len. 34]: This stupendous blank is hot , not to say torrid ; a part of it is fertile , the rest is desert ; it is not liberally watered ; it has no towns .
Parsing [sent. 1309 len. 40]: One has only to cross the mountains of New South Wales and descend into the westward-lying regions to find that he has left the choice climate behind him , and found a new one of a quite different character .
Parsing [sent. 1310 len. 21]: In fact , he would not know by the thermometer that he was not in the blistering Plains of India .
Parsing [sent. 1311 len. 15]: Captain Sturt , the great explorer , gives us a sample of the heat .
Parsing [sent. 1312 len. 30]: `` The wind , which had been blowing all the morning from the N.E. , increased to a heavy gale , and I shall never forget its withering effect .
Parsing [sent. 1313 len. 27]: I sought shelter behind a large gum-tree , but the blasts of heat were so terrific that I wondered the very grass did not take fire .
Parsing [sent. 1314 len. 65]: This really was nothing ideal : everything both animate and inanimate gave way before it ; the horses stood with their backs to the wind and their noses to the ground , without the muscular strength to raise their heads ; the birds were mute , and the leaves of the trees under which we were sitting fell like a snow shower around us .
Parsing [sent. 1315 len. 26]: At noon I took a thermometer graded to 127 deg. , out of my box , and observed that the mercury was up to 125 .
Parsing [sent. 1316 len. 30]: Thinking that it had been unduly influenced , I put it in the fork of a tree close to me , sheltered alike from the wind and the sun .
Parsing [sent. 1317 len. 42]: I went to examine it about an hour afterwards , when I found the mercury had risen to the-top of the instrument and had burst the bulb , a circumstance that I believe no traveler has ever before had to record .
Parsing [sent. 1318 len. 27]: I can not find language to convey to the reader 's mind an idea of the intense and oppressive nature of the heat that prevailed . ''
Parsing [sent. 1319 len. 20]: That hot wind sweeps over Sydney sometimes , and brings with it what is called a `` dust-storm . ''
Parsing [sent. 1320 len. 13]: It is said that most Australian towns are acquainted with the dust-storm .
Parsing [sent. 1321 len. 36]: I think I know what it is like , for the following description by Mr. Gane tallies very well with the alkali duststorm of Nevada , if you leave out the `` shovel '' part .
Parsing [sent. 1322 len. 27]: Still the shovel part is a pretty important part , and seems to indicate that my Nevada storm is but a poor thing , after all .
Parsing [sent. 1323 len. 27]: `` As we proceeded the altitude became less , and the heat proportionately greater until we reached Dubbo , which is only 600 feet above sea-level .
Parsing [sent. 1324 len. 15]: It is a pretty town , built on an extensive plain . . . .
Parsing [sent. 1325 len. 49]: After the effects of a shower of rain have passed away the surface of the ground crumbles into a thick layer of dust , and occasionally , when the wind is in a particular quarter , it is lifted bodily from the ground in one long opaque cloud .
Parsing [sent. 1326 len. 38]: In the midst of such a storm nothing can be seen a few yards ahead , and the unlucky person who happens to be out at the time is compelled to seek the nearest retreat at hand .
Parsing [sent. 1327 len. 30]: When the thrifty housewife sees in the distance the dark column advancing in a steady whirl towards her house , she closes the doors and windows with all expedition .
Parsing [sent. 1328 len. 22]: A drawing-room , the window of which has been carelessly left open during a dust-storm , is indeed an extraordinary sight .
Parsing [sent. 1329 len. 33]: A lady who has resided in Dubbo for some years says that the dust lies so thick on the carpet that it is necessary to use a shovel to remove it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1330 len. 5]: And probably a wagon .
Parsing [sent. 1331 len. 12]: I was mistaken ; I have not seen a proper duststorm .
Parsing [sent. 1332 len. 62]: To my mind the exterior aspects and character of Australia are fascinating things to look at and think about , they are so strange , so weird , so new , so uncommonplace , such a startling and interesting contrast to the other sections of the planet , the sections that are known to us all , familiar to us all .
Parsing [sent. 1333 len. 81]: In the matter of particulars -- a detail here , a detail there -- we have had the choice climate of New South Wales ' seacoast ; we have had the Australian heat as furnished by Captain Sturt ; we have had the wonderful dust-storm ; and we have considered the phenomenon of an almost empty hot wilderness half as big as the United States , with a narrow belt of civilization , population , and good climate around it .
Parsing [sent. 1334 len. 7]: CHAPTER X. Everything human is pathetic .
Parsing [sent. 1335 len. 12]: The secret source of Humor itself is not joy but sorrow .
Parsing [sent. 1336 len. 7]: There is no humor in heaven .
Parsing [sent. 1337 len. 9]: -- Pudd ` nhead Wilson 's New Calendar .
Parsing [sent. 1338 len. 21]: Captain Cook found Australia in 1770 , and eighteen years later the British Government began to transport convicts to it .
Parsing [sent. 1339 len. 11]: Altogether , New South Wales received 83,000 in 53 years .
Parsing [sent. 1340 len. 47]: The convicts wore heavy chains ; they were ill-fed and badly treated by the officers set over them ; they were heavily punished for even slight infractions of the rules ; `` the cruelest discipline ever known '' is one historian 's description of their life .
Parsing [sent. 1341 len. 7]: -- -LSB- The Story of Australasia .
Parsing [sent. 1342 len. 5]: J. S. Laurie . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 1343 len. 8]: English law was hard-hearted in those days .
Parsing [sent. 1344 len. 55]: For trifling offenses which in our day would be punished by a small fine or a few days ' confinement , men , women , and boys were sent to this other end of the earth to serve terms of seven and fourteen years ; and for serious crimes they were transported for life .
Parsing [sent. 1345 len. 15]: Children were sent to the penal colonies for seven years for stealing a rabbit !
Parsing [sent. 1346 len. 34]: When I was in London twenty-three years ago there was a new penalty in force for diminishing garroting and wife-beating -- 25 lashes on the bare back with the cat-o ' - nine-tails .
Parsing [sent. 1347 len. 46]: It was said that this terrible punishment was able to bring the stubbornest ruffians to terms ; and that no man had been found with grit enough to keep his emotions to himself beyond the ninth blow ; as a rule the man shrieked earlier .
Parsing [sent. 1348 len. 29]: That penalty had a great and wholesome effect upon the garroters and wife-beaters ; but humane modern London could not endure it ; it got its law rescinded .
Parsing [sent. 1349 len. 22]: Many a bruised and battered English wife has since had occasion to deplore that cruel achievement of sentimental `` humanity . ''
Parsing [sent. 1350 len. 3]: Twenty-five lashes !
Parsing [sent. 1351 len. 45]: In Australia and Tasmania they gave a convict fifty for almost any little offense ; and sometimes a brutal officer would add fifty , and then another fifty , and so on , as long as the sufferer could endure the torture and live .
Parsing [sent. 1352 len. 32]: In Tasmania I read the entry , in an old manuscript official record , of a case where a convict was given three hundred lashes -- for stealing some silver spoons .
Parsing [sent. 1353 len. 9]: And men got more than that , sometimes .
Parsing [sent. 1354 len. 5]: Who handled the cat ?
Parsing [sent. 1355 len. 72]: Often it was another convict ; sometimes it was the culprit 's dearest comrade ; and he had to lay on with all his might ; otherwise he would get a flogging himself for his mercy -- for he was under watch -- and yet not do his friend any good : the friend would be attended to by another hand and suffer no lack in the matter of full punishment .
Parsing [sent. 1356 len. 59]: The convict life in Tasmania was so unendurable , and suicide so difficult to accomplish that once or twice despairing men got together and drew straws to determine which of them should kill another of the group -- this murder to secure death to the perpetrator and to the witnesses of it by the hand of the hangman !
Parsing [sent. 1357 len. 71]: The incidents quoted above are mere hints , mere suggestions of what convict life was like -- they are but a couple of details tossed into view out of a shoreless sea of such ; or , to change the figure , they are but a pair of flaming steeples photographed from a point which hides from sight the burning city which stretches away from their bases on every hand .
Parsing [sent. 1358 len. 46]: Some of the convicts -- indeed , a good many of them -- were very bad people , even for that day ; but the most of them were probably not noticeably worse than the average of the people they left behind them at home .
Parsing [sent. 1359 len. 11]: We must believe this ; we can not avoid it .
Parsing [sent. 1360 len. 84]: We are obliged to believe that a nation that could look on , unmoved , and see starving or freezing women hanged for stealing twenty-six cents ' worth of bacon or rags , and boys snatched from their mothers , and men from their families , and sent to the other side of the world for long terms of years for similar trifling offenses , was a nation to whom the term `` civilized '' could not in any large way be applied .
Parsing [sent. 1361 len. 44]: And we must also believe that a nation that knew , during more than forty years , what was happening to those exiles and was still content with it , was not advancing in any showy way toward a higher grade of civilization .
Parsing [sent. 1362 len. 58]: If we look into the characters and conduct of the officers and gentlemen who had charge of the convicts and attended to their backs and stomachs , we must grant again that as between the convict and his masters , and between both and the nation at home , there was a quite noticeable monotony of sameness .
Parsing [sent. 1363 len. 12]: Four years had gone by , and many convicts had come .
Parsing [sent. 1364 len. 7]: Respectable settlers were beginning to arrive .
Parsing [sent. 1365 len. 21]: These two classes of colonists had to be protected , in case of trouble among themselves or with the natives .
Parsing [sent. 1366 len. 18]: It is proper to mention the natives , though they could hardly count they were so scarce .
Parsing [sent. 1367 len. 42]: At a time when they had not as yet begun to be much disturbed -- not as yet being in the way -- it was estimated that in New South Wales there was but one native to 45,000 acres of territory .
Parsing [sent. 1368 len. 6]: People had to be protected .
Parsing [sent. 1369 len. 24]: Officers of the regular army did not want this service -- away off there where neither honor nor distinction was to be gained .
Parsing [sent. 1370 len. 26]: So England recruited and officered a kind of militia force of 1,000 uniformed civilians called the `` New South Wales Corps '' and shipped it .
Parsing [sent. 1371 len. 8]: This was the worst blow of all .
Parsing [sent. 1372 len. 7]: The colony fairly staggered under it .
Parsing [sent. 1373 len. 16]: The Corps was an object-lesson of the moral condition of England outside of the jails .
Parsing [sent. 1374 len. 4]: The colonists trembled .
Parsing [sent. 1375 len. 14]: It was feared that next there would be an importation of the nobility .
Parsing [sent. 1376 len. 9]: In those early days the colony was non-supporting .
Parsing [sent. 1377 len. 45]: All the necessaries of life -- food , clothing , and all -- were sent out from England , and kept in great government store-houses , and given to the convicts and sold to the settlers -- sold at a trifling advance upon cost .
Parsing [sent. 1378 len. 6]: The Corps saw its opportunity .
Parsing [sent. 1379 len. 13]: Its officers went into commerce , and in a most lawless way .
Parsing [sent. 1380 len. 25]: They went to importing rum , and also to manufacturing it in private stills , in defiance of the government 's commands and protests .
Parsing [sent. 1381 len. 32]: They leagued themselves together and ruled the market ; they boycotted the government and the other dealers ; they established a close monopoly and kept it strictly in their own hands .
Parsing [sent. 1382 len. 38]: When a vessel arrived with spirits , they allowed nobody to buy but themselves , and they forced the owner to sell to them at a price named by themselves -- and it was always low enough .
Parsing [sent. 1383 len. 20]: They bought rum at an average of two dollars a gallon and sold it at an average of ten .
Parsing [sent. 1384 len. 46]: They made rum the currency of the country -- for there was little or no money -- and they maintained their devastating hold and kept the colony under their heel for eighteen or twenty years before they were finally conquered and routed by the government .
Parsing [sent. 1385 len. 8]: Meantime , they had spread intemperance everywhere .
Parsing [sent. 1386 len. 22]: And they had squeezed farm after farm out of the settlers hands for rum , and thus had bountifully enriched themselves .
Parsing [sent. 1387 len. 23]: When a farmer was caught in the last agonies of thirst they took advantage of him and sweated him for a drink .
Parsing [sent. 1388 len. 29]: In one instance they sold a man a gallon of rum worth two dollars for a piece of property which was sold some years later for $ 100,000 .
Parsing [sent. 1389 len. 23]: When the colony was about eighteen or twenty years old it was discovered that the land was specially fitted for the wool-culture .
Parsing [sent. 1390 len. 28]: Prosperity followed , commerce with the world began , by and by rich mines of the noble metals were opened , immigrants flowed in , capital likewise .
Parsing [sent. 1391 len. 15]: The result is the great and wealthy and enlightened commonwealth of New South Wales .
Parsing [sent. 1392 len. 75]: It is a country that is rich in mines , wool ranches , trams , railways , steamship lines , schools , newspapers , botanical gardens , art galleries , libraries , museums , hospitals , learned societies ; it is the hospitable home of every species of culture and of every species of material enterprise , and there is a church at every man 's door , and a race-track over the way .

Parsing [sent. 1398 len. 19]: The English-speaking colony of the United States of America is always called lavishly hospitable by the English traveler .
Parsing [sent. 1399 len. 24]: As to the other English-speaking colonies throughout the world from Canada all around , I know by experience that the description fits them .
Parsing [sent. 1400 len. 38]: I will not go more particularly into this matter , for I find that when writers try to distribute their gratitude here and there and yonder by detail they run across difficulties and do some ungraceful stumbling .
Parsing [sent. 1401 len. 36]: Mr. Gane -LRB- `` New South Wales and Victoria in 1885 '' -RRB- , tried to distribute his gratitude , and was not lucky : `` The inhabitants of Sydney are renowned for their hospitality .
Parsing [sent. 1402 len. 29]: The treatment which we experienced at the hands of this generous-hearted people will help more than anything else to make us recollect with pleasure our stay amongst them .
Parsing [sent. 1403 len. 10]: In the character of hosts and hostesses they excel .

Parsing [sent. 1406 len. 8]: Nobody could say it finer than that .
Parsing [sent. 1407 len. 26]: If he had put in his cork then , and stayed away from Dubbo -- but no ; heedless man , he pulled it again .
Parsing [sent. 1408 len. 52]: Pulled it when he was away along in his book , and his memory of what he had said about Sydney had grown dim : `` We can not quit the promising town of Dubbo without testifying , in warm praise , to the kind-hearted and hospitable usages of its inhabitants .
Parsing [sent. 1409 len. 23]: Sydney , though well deserving the character it bears of its kindly treatment of strangers , possesses a little formality and reserve .
Parsing [sent. 1410 len. 35]: In Dubbo , on the contrary , though the same congenial manners prevail , there is a pleasing degree of respectful familiarity which gives the town a homely comfort not often met with elsewhere .
Parsing [sent. 1411 len. 70]: In laying on one side our pen we feel contented in having been able , though so late in this work , to bestow a panegyric , however unpretentious , on a town which , though possessing no picturesque natural surroundings , nor interesting architectural productions , has yet a body of citizens whose hearts can not but obtain for their town a reputation for benevolence and kind-heartedness . ''
Parsing [sent. 1412 len. 8]: I wonder what soured him on Sydney .
Parsing [sent. 1413 len. 28]: It seems strange that a pleasing degree of three or four fingers of respectful familiarity should fill a man up and give him the panegyrics so bad .
Parsing [sent. 1414 len. 15]: For he has them , the worst way -- any one can see that .
Parsing [sent. 1415 len. 40]: A man who is perfectly at himself does not throw cold detraction at people 's architectural productions and picturesque surroundings , and let on that what he prefers is a Dubbonese dust-storm and a pleasing degree of respectful familiarity .
Parsing [sent. 1416 len. 23]: No , these are old , old symptoms ; and when they appear we know that the man has got the panegyrics .
Parsing [sent. 1417 len. 7]: Sydney has a population of 400,000 .
Parsing [sent. 1418 len. 52]: When a stranger from America steps ashore there , the first thing that strikes him is that the place is eight or nine times as large as he was expecting it to be ; and the next thing that strikes him is that it is an English city with American trimmings .
Parsing [sent. 1419 len. 52]: Later on , in Melbourne , he will find the American trimmings still more in evidence ; there , even the architecture will often suggest America ; a photograph of its stateliest business street might be passed upon him for a picture of the finest street in a large American city .
Parsing [sent. 1420 len. 17]: I was told that the most of the fine residences were the city residences of squatters .
Parsing [sent. 1421 len. 8]: The name seemed out of focus somehow .
Parsing [sent. 1422 len. 30]: When the explanation came , it offered a new instance of the curious changes which words , as well as animals , undergo through change of habitat and climate .
Parsing [sent. 1423 len. 211]: With us , when you speak of a squatter you are always supposed to be speaking of a poor man , but in Australia when you speak of a squatter you are supposed to be speaking of a millionaire ; in America the word indicates the possessor of a few acres and a doubtful title , in Australia it indicates a man whose landfront is as long as a railroad , and whose title has been perfected in one way or another ; in America the word indicates a man who owns a dozen head of live stock , in Australia a man who owns anywhere from fifty thousand up to half a million head ; in America the word indicates a man who is obscure and not important , in Australia a man who is prominent and of the first importance ; in America you take off your hat to no squatter , in Australia you do ; in America if your uncle is a squatter you keep it dark , in Australia you advertise it ; in America if your friend is a squatter nothing comes of it , but with a squatter for your friend in Australia you may sup with kings if there are any around .
Parsing [sent. 1424 len. 52]: In Australia it takes about two acres and a half of pastureland -LRB- some people say twice as many -RRB- , to support a sheep ; and when the squatter has half a million sheep his private domain is about as large as Rhode Island , to speak in general terms .
Parsing [sent. 1425 len. 15]: His annual wool crop may be worth a quarter or a half million dollars .
Parsing [sent. 1426 len. 46]: He will live in a palace in Melbourne or Sydney or some other of the large cities , and make occasional trips to his sheep-kingdom several hundred miles away in the great plains to look after his battalions of riders and shepherds and other hands .
Parsing [sent. 1427 len. 63]: He has a commodious dwelling out there , and if he approve of you he will invite you to spend a week in it , and will make you at home and comfortable , and let you see the great industry in all its details , and feed you and slake you and smoke you with the best that money can buy .
Parsing [sent. 1428 len. 45]: On at least one of these vast estates there is a considerable town , with all the various businesses and occupations that go to make an important town ; and the town and the land it stands upon are the property of the squatters .
Parsing [sent. 1429 len. 20]: I have seen that town , and it is not unlikely that there are other squatter-owned towns in Australia .
Parsing [sent. 1430 len. 15]: Australia supplies the world not only with fine wool , but with mutton also .
Parsing [sent. 1431 len. 17]: The modern invention of cold storage and its application in ships has created this great trade .
Parsing [sent. 1432 len. 26]: In Sydney I visited a huge establishment where they kill and clean and solidly freeze a thousand sheep a day , for shipment to England .
Parsing [sent. 1433 len. 29]: The Australians did not seem to me to differ noticeably from Americans , either in dress , carriage , ways , pronunciation , inflections , or general appearance .
Parsing [sent. 1434 len. 28]: There were fleeting and subtle suggestions of their English origin , but these were not pronounced enough , as a rule , to catch one 's attention .
Parsing [sent. 1435 len. 20]: The people have easy and cordial manners from the beginning -- from the moment that the introduction is completed .
Parsing [sent. 1436 len. 4]: This is American .
Parsing [sent. 1437 len. 20]: To put it in another way , it is English friendliness with the English shyness and self-consciousness left out .
Parsing [sent. 1438 len. 39]: Now and then -- but this is rare -- one hears such words as piper for paper , lydy for lady , and tyble for table fall from lips whence one would not expect such pronunciations to come .
Parsing [sent. 1439 len. 35]: There is a superstition prevalent in Sydney that this pronunciation is an Australianism , but people who have been `` home '' -- as the native reverently and lovingly calls England -- know better .
Parsing [sent. 1440 len. 6]: It is `` costermonger . ''
Parsing [sent. 1441 len. 31]: All over Australasia this pronunciation is nearly as common among servants as it is in London among the uneducated and the partially educated of all sorts and conditions of people .
Parsing [sent. 1442 len. 26]: That mislaid ` y ' is rather striking when a person gets enough of it into a short sentence to enable it to show up .
Parsing [sent. 1443 len. 42]: In the hotel in Sydney the chambermaid said , one morning : `` The tyble is set , and here is the piper ; and if the lydy is ready I 'll tell the wyter to bring up the breakfast . ''
Parsing [sent. 1444 len. 25]: I have made passing mention , a moment ago , of the native Australasian 's custom of speaking of England as `` home . ''
Parsing [sent. 1445 len. 53]: It was always pretty to hear it , and often it was said in an unconsciously caressing way that made it touching ; in a way which transmuted a sentiment into an embodiment , and made one seem to see Australasia as a young girl stroking mother England 's old gray head .
Parsing [sent. 1446 len. 18]: In the Australasian home the table-talk is vivacious and unembarrassed ; it is without stiffness or restraint .
Parsing [sent. 1447 len. 15]: This does not remind one of England so much as it does of America .
Parsing [sent. 1448 len. 20]: But Australasia is strictly democratic , and reserves and restraints are things that are bred by differences of rank .
Parsing [sent. 1449 len. 10]: English and colonial audiences are phenomenally alert and responsive .
Parsing [sent. 1450 len. 101]: Where masses of people are gathered together in England , caste is submerged , and with it the English reserve ; equality exists for the moment , and every individual is free ; so free from any consciousness of fetters , indeed , that the Englishman 's habit of watching himself and guarding himself against any injudicious exposure of his feelings is forgotten , and falls into abeyance -- and to such a degree indeed , that he will bravely applaud all by himself if he wants to -- an exhibition of daring which is unusual elsewhere in the world .
Parsing [sent. 1451 len. 28]: But it is hard to move a new English acquaintance when he is by himself , or when the company present is small and new to him .
Parsing [sent. 1452 len. 16]: He is on his guard then , and his natural reserve is to the fore .
Parsing [sent. 1453 len. 18]: This has given him the false reputation of being without humor and without the appreciation of humor .
Parsing [sent. 1454 len. 41]: Americans are not Englishmen , and American humor is not English humor ; but both the American and his humor had their origin in England , and have merely undergone changes brought about by changed conditions and a new environment .
Parsing [sent. 1455 len. 34]: About the best humorous speeches I have yet heard were a couple that were made in Australia at club suppers -- one of them by an Englishman , the other by an Australian .

Parsing [sent. 1459 len. 35]: In Sydney I had a large dream , and in the course of talk I told it to a missionary from India who was on his way to visit some relatives in New Zealand .
Parsing [sent. 1460 len. 56]: I dreamed that the visible universe is the physical person of God ; that the vast worlds that we see twinkling millions of miles apart in the fields of space are the blood corpuscles in His veins ; and that we and the other creatures are the microbes that charge with multitudinous life the corpuscles .
Parsing [sent. 1461 len. 65]: Mr. X. , the missionary , considered the dream awhile , then said : `` It is not surpassable for magnitude , since its metes and bounds are the metes and bounds of the universe itself ; and it seems to me that it almost accounts for a thing which is otherwise nearly unaccountable -- the origin of the sacred legends of the Hindoos .
Parsing [sent. 1462 len. 17]: Perhaps they dream them , and then honestly believe them to be divine revelations of fact .
Parsing [sent. 1463 len. 34]: It looks like that , for the legends are built on so vast a scale that it does not seem reasonable that plodding priests would happen upon such colossal fancies when awake . ''
Parsing [sent. 1464 len. 47]: He told some of the legends , and said that they were implicitly believed by all classes of Hindoos , including those of high social position and intelligence ; and he said that this universal credulity was a great hindrance to the missionary in his work .
Parsing [sent. 1465 len. 23]: Then he said something like this : `` At home , people wonder why Christianity does not make faster progress in India .
Parsing [sent. 1466 len. 24]: They hear that the Indians believe easily , and that they have a natural trust in miracles and give them a hospitable reception .
Parsing [sent. 1467 len. 36]: Then they argue like this : since the Indian believes easily , place Christianity before them and they must believe ; confirm its truths by the biblical miracles , and they will no longer doubt .
Parsing [sent. 1468 len. 33]: The natural deduction is , that as Christianity makes but indifferent progress in India , the fault is with us : we are not fortunate in presenting the doctrines and the miracles .
Parsing [sent. 1469 len. 19]: `` But the truth is , we are not by any means so well equipped as they think .
Parsing [sent. 1470 len. 10]: We have not the easy task that they imagine .
Parsing [sent. 1471 len. 53]: To use a military figure , we are sent against the enemy with good powder in our guns , but only wads for bullets ; that is to say , our miracles are not effective ; the Hindoos do not care for them ; they have more extraordinary ones of their own .
Parsing [sent. 1472 len. 26]: All the details of their own religion are proven and established by miracles ; the details of ours must be proven in the same way .
Parsing [sent. 1473 len. 19]: When I first began my work in India I greatly underestimated the difficulties thus put upon my task .
Parsing [sent. 1474 len. 8]: A correction was not long in coming .
Parsing [sent. 1475 len. 39]: I thought as our friends think at home -- that to prepare my childlike wonder-lovers to listen with favor to my grave message I only needed to charm the way to it with wonders , marvels , miracles .
Parsing [sent. 1476 len. 25]: With full confidence I told the wonders performed by Samson , the strongest man that had ever lived -- for so I called him .
Parsing [sent. 1477 len. 47]: `` At first I saw lively anticipation and strong interest in the faces of my people , but as I moved along from incident to incident of the great story , I was distressed to see that I was steadily losing the sympathy of my audience .
Parsing [sent. 1478 len. 6]: I could not understand it .
Parsing [sent. 1479 len. 11]: It was a surprise to me , and a disappointment .
Parsing [sent. 1480 len. 13]: Before I was through , the fading sympathy had paled to indifference .
Parsing [sent. 1481 len. 19]: Thence to the end the indifference remained ; I was not able to make any impression upon it .
Parsing [sent. 1482 len. 13]: `` A good old Hindoo gentleman told me where my trouble lay .
Parsing [sent. 1483 len. 21]: He said ` We Hindoos recognize a god by the work of his hands -- we accept no other testimony .
Parsing [sent. 1484 len. 11]: Apparently , this is also the rule with you Christians .
Parsing [sent. 1485 len. 37]: And we know when a man has his power from a god by the fact that he does things which he could not do , as a man , with the mere powers of a man .
Parsing [sent. 1486 len. 28]: Plainly , this is the Christian 's way also , of knowing when a man is working by a god 's power and not by his own .
Parsing [sent. 1487 len. 29]: You saw that there was a supernatural property in the hair of Samson ; for you perceived that when his hair was gone he was as other men .
Parsing [sent. 1488 len. 10]: It is our way , as I have said .
Parsing [sent. 1489 len. 30]: There are many nations in the world , and each group of nations has its own gods , and will pay no worship to the gods of the others .
Parsing [sent. 1490 len. 30]: Each group believes its own gods to be strongest , and it will not exchange them except for gods that shall be proven to be their superiors in power .
Parsing [sent. 1491 len. 21]: Man is but a weak creature , and needs the help of gods -- he can not do without it .
Parsing [sent. 1492 len. 21]: Shall he place his fate in the hands of weak gods when there may be stronger ones to be found ?
Parsing [sent. 1493 len. 5]: That would be foolish .
Parsing [sent. 1494 len. 34]: No , if he hear of gods that are stronger than his own , he should not turn a deaf ear , for it is not a light matter that is at stake .
Parsing [sent. 1495 len. 24]: How then shall he determine which gods are the stronger , his own or those that preside over the concerns of other nations ?
Parsing [sent. 1496 len. 22]: By comparing the known works of his own gods with the works of those others ; there is no other way .
Parsing [sent. 1497 len. 20]: Now , when we make this comparison , we are not drawn towards the gods of any other nation .
Parsing [sent. 1498 len. 16]: Our gods are shown by their works to be the strongest , the most powerful .
Parsing [sent. 1499 len. 24]: The Christians have but few gods , and they are new -- new , and not strong ; as it seems to us .
Parsing [sent. 1500 len. 54]: They will increase in number , it is true , for this has happened with all gods , but that time is far away , many ages and decades of ages away , for gods multiply slowly , as is meet for beings to whom a thousand years is but a single moment .
Parsing [sent. 1501 len. 11]: Our own gods have been born millions of years apart .
Parsing [sent. 1502 len. 15]: The process is slow , the gathering of strength and power is similarly slow .
Parsing [sent. 1503 len. 20]: In the slow lapse of the ages the steadily accumulating power of our gods has at last become prodigious .
Parsing [sent. 1504 len. 29]: We have a thousand proofs of this in the colossal character of their personal acts and the acts of ordinary men to whom they have given supernatural qualities .
Parsing [sent. 1505 len. 57]: To your Samson was given supernatural power , and when he broke the withes , and slew the thousands with the jawbone of an ass , and carried away the gate 's of the city upon his shoulders , you were amazed -- and also awed , for you recognized the divine source of his strength .
Parsing [sent. 1506 len. 53]: But it could not profit to place these things before your Hindoo congregation and invite their wonder ; for they would compare them with the deed done by Hanuman , when our gods infused their divine strength into his muscles ; and they would be indifferent to them -- as you saw .
Parsing [sent. 1507 len. 73]: In the old , old times , ages and ages gone by , when our god Rama was warring with the demon god of Ceylon , Rama bethought him to bridge the sea and connect Ceylon with India , so that his armies might pass easily over ; and he sent his general , Hanuman , inspired like your own Samson with divine strength , to bring the materials for the bridge .
Parsing [sent. 1508 len. 36]: In two days Hanuman strode fifteen hundred miles , to the Himalayas , and took upon his shoulder a range of those lofty mountains two hundred miles long , and started with it toward Ceylon .
Parsing [sent. 1509 len. 56]: It was in the night ; and , as he passed along the plain , the people of Govardhun heard the thunder of his tread and felt the earth rocking under it , and they ran out , and there , with their snowy summits piled to heaven , they saw the Himalayas passing by .
Parsing [sent. 1510 len. 40]: And as this huge continent swept along overshadowing the earth , upon its slopes they discerned the twinkling lights of a thousand sleeping villages , and it was as if the constellations were filing in procession through the sky .
Parsing [sent. 1511 len. 24]: While they were looking , Hanuman stumbled , and a small ridge of red sandstone twenty miles long was jolted loose and fell .
Parsing [sent. 1512 len. 42]: Half of its length has wasted away in the course of the ages , but the other ten miles of it remain in the plain by Govardhun to this day as proof of the might of the inspiration of our gods .
Parsing [sent. 1513 len. 24]: You must know , yourself , that Hanuman could not have carried those mountains to Ceylon except by the strength of the gods .
Parsing [sent. 1514 len. 46]: You know that it was not done by his own strength , therefore , you know that it was done by the strength of the gods , just as you know that Samson carried the gates by the divine strength and not by his own .
Parsing [sent. 1515 len. 83]: I think you must concede two things : First , That in carrying the gates of the city upon his shoulders , Samson did not establish the superiority of his gods over ours ; secondly , That his feat is not supported by any but verbal evidence , while Hanuman 's is not only supported by verbal evidence , but this evidence is confirmed , established , proven , by visible , tangible evidence , which is the strongest of all testimony .

Parsing [sent. 1531 len. 29]: The botanical garden of Sydney covers thirty-eight acres , beautifully laid out and rich with the spoil of all the lands and all the climes of the world .
Parsing [sent. 1532 len. 44]: The garden is on high ground in the middle of the town , overlooking the great harbor , and it adjoins the spacious grounds of Government House -- fifty-six acres ; and at hand also , is a recreation ground containing eighty-two acres .
Parsing [sent. 1533 len. 23]: In addition , there are the zoological gardens , the race-course , and the great cricket-grounds where the international matches are played .
Parsing [sent. 1534 len. 26]: Therefore there is plenty of room for reposeful lazying and lounging , and for exercise too , for such as like that kind of work .
Parsing [sent. 1535 len. 12]: There are four specialties attainable in the way of social pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 1536 len. 35]: If you enter your name on the Visitor 's Book at Government House you will receive an invitation to the next ball that takes place there , if nothing can be proven against you .
Parsing [sent. 1537 len. 29]: And it will be very pleasant ; for you will see everybody except the Governor , and add a number of acquaintances and several friends to your list .
Parsing [sent. 1538 len. 7]: The Governor will be in England .
Parsing [sent. 1539 len. 4]: He always is .
Parsing [sent. 1540 len. 31]: The continent has four or five governors , and I do not know how many it takes to govern the outlying archipelago ; but anyway you will not see them .
Parsing [sent. 1541 len. 33]: When they are appointed they come out from England and get inaugurated , and give a ball , and help pray for rain , and get aboard ship and go back home .
Parsing [sent. 1542 len. 11]: And so the Lieutenant-Governor has to do all the work .
Parsing [sent. 1543 len. 16]: I was in Australasia three months and a half , and saw only one Governor .
Parsing [sent. 1544 len. 6]: The others were at home .
Parsing [sent. 1545 len. 36]: The Australasian Governor would not be so restless , perhaps , if he had a war , or a veto , or something like that to call for his reserve-energies , but he has n't .
Parsing [sent. 1546 len. 16]: There is n't any war , and there is n't any veto in his hands .
Parsing [sent. 1547 len. 13]: And so there is really little or nothing doing in his line .
Parsing [sent. 1548 len. 54]: The country governs itself , and prefers to do it ; and is so strenuous about it and so jealous of its independence that it grows restive if even the Imperial Government at home proposes to help ; and so the Imperial veto , while a fact , is yet mainly a name .
Parsing [sent. 1549 len. 18]: Thus the Governor 's functions are much more limited than are a Governor 's functions with us .
Parsing [sent. 1550 len. 5]: And therefore more fatiguing .
Parsing [sent. 1551 len. 17]: He is the apparent head of the State , he is the real head of Society .
Parsing [sent. 1552 len. 32]: He represents culture , refinement , elevated sentiment , polite life , religion ; and by his example he propagates these , and they spread and flourish and bear good fruit .
Parsing [sent. 1553 len. 9]: He creates the fashion , and leads it .
Parsing [sent. 1554 len. 16]: His ball is the ball of balls , and his countenance makes the horse-race thrive .
Parsing [sent. 1555 len. 33]: He is usually a lord , and this is well ; for his position compels him to lead an expensive life , and an English lord is generally well equipped for that .
Parsing [sent. 1556 len. 25]: Another of Sydney 's social pleasures is the visit to the Admiralty House ; which is nobly situated on high ground overlooking the water .
Parsing [sent. 1557 len. 31]: The trim boats of the service convey the guests thither ; and there , or on board the flag-ship , they have the duplicate of the hospitalities of Government House .
Parsing [sent. 1558 len. 30]: The Admiral commanding a station in British waters is a magnate of the first degree , and he is sumptuously housed , as becomes the dignity of his office .
Parsing [sent. 1559 len. 19]: Third in the list of special pleasures is the tour of the harbor in a fine steam pleasure-launch .
Parsing [sent. 1560 len. 29]: Your richer friends own boats of this kind , and they will invite you , and the joys of the trip will make a long day seem short .
Parsing [sent. 1561 len. 6]: And finally comes the shark-fishing .
Parsing [sent. 1562 len. 15]: Sydney Harbor is populous with the finest breeds of man-eating sharks in the world .
Parsing [sent. 1563 len. 18]: Some people make their living catching them ; for the Government pays a cash bounty on them .
Parsing [sent. 1564 len. 19]: The larger the shark the larger the bounty , and some of the sharks are twenty feet long .
Parsing [sent. 1565 len. 18]: You not only get the bounty , but everything that is in the shark belongs to you .
Parsing [sent. 1566 len. 7]: Sometimes the contents are quite valuable .
Parsing [sent. 1567 len. 9]: The shark is the swiftest fish that swims .
Parsing [sent. 1568 len. 13]: The speed of the fastest steamer afloat is poor compared to his .
Parsing [sent. 1569 len. 35]: And he is a great gad-about , and roams far and wide in the oceans , and visits the shores of all of them , ultimately , in the course of his restless excursions .
Parsing [sent. 1570 len. 17]: I have a tale to tell now , which has not as yet been in print .
Parsing [sent. 1571 len. 38]: In 1870 a young stranger arrived in Sydney , and set about finding something to do ; but he knew no one , and brought no recommendations , and the result was that he got no employment .
Parsing [sent. 1572 len. 44]: He had aimed high , at first , but as time and his money wasted away he grew less and less exacting , until at last he was willing to serve in the humblest capacities if so he might get bread and shelter .
Parsing [sent. 1573 len. 16]: But luck was still against him ; he could find no opening of any sort .
Parsing [sent. 1574 len. 7]: Finally his money was all gone .
Parsing [sent. 1575 len. 25]: He walked the streets all day , thinking ; he walked them all night , thinking , thinking , and growing hungrier and hungrier .
Parsing [sent. 1576 len. 18]: At dawn he found himself well away from the town and drifting aimlessly along the harbor shore .
Parsing [sent. 1577 len. 35]: As he was passing by a nodding shark-fisher the man looked up and said -- `` Say , young fellow , take my line a spell , and change my luck for me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1578 len. 13]: `` How do you know I wo n't make it worse ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1579 len. 6]: `` Because you ca n't .
Parsing [sent. 1580 len. 9]: It has been at its worst all night .
Parsing [sent. 1581 len. 27]: If you ca n't change it , no harm 's done ; if you do change it , it 's for the better , of course .
Parsing [sent. 1582 len. 3]: Come . ''
Parsing [sent. 1583 len. 10]: `` All right , what will you give ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1584 len. 14]: `` I 'll give you the shark , if you catch one . ''
Parsing [sent. 1585 len. 11]: `` And I will eat it , bones and all .
Parsing [sent. 1586 len. 6]: Give me the line . ''
Parsing [sent. 1587 len. 5]: `` Here you are .
Parsing [sent. 1588 len. 47]: I will get away , now , for awhile , so that my luck wo n't spoil yours ; for many and many a time I 've noticed that if -- there , pull in , pull in , man , you 've got a bite !
Parsing [sent. 1589 len. 7]: I knew how it would be .
Parsing [sent. 1590 len. 17]: Why , I knew you for a born son of luck the minute I saw you .
Parsing [sent. 1591 len. 8]: All right -- he 's landed . ''
Parsing [sent. 1592 len. 27]: It was an unusually large shark -- `` a full nineteen-footer , '' the fisherman said , as he laid the creature open with his knife .
Parsing [sent. 1593 len. 20]: `` Now you rob him , young man , while I step to my hamper for a fresh bait .
Parsing [sent. 1594 len. 10]: There 's generally something in them worth going for .
Parsing [sent. 1595 len. 9]: You 've changed my luck , you see .
Parsing [sent. 1596 len. 14]: But my goodness , I hope you have n't changed your own . ''
Parsing [sent. 1597 len. 14]: `` Oh , it would n't matter ; do n't worry about that .
Parsing [sent. 1598 len. 4]: Get your bait .
Parsing [sent. 1599 len. 6]: I 'll rob him . ''
Parsing [sent. 1600 len. 23]: When the fisherman got back the young man had just finished washing his hands in the bay , and was starting away .
Parsing [sent. 1601 len. 9]: `` What , you are not going ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1602 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 1603 len. 3]: Good-bye . ''
Parsing [sent. 1604 len. 8]: `` But what about your shark ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1605 len. 4]: `` The shark ?
Parsing [sent. 1606 len. 10]: Why , what use is he to me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1607 len. 6]: `` What use is he ?
Parsing [sent. 1608 len. 4]: I like that .
Parsing [sent. 1609 len. 25]: Do n't you know that we can go and report him to Government , and you 'll get a clean solid eighty shillings bounty ?
Parsing [sent. 1610 len. 6]: Hard cash , you know .
Parsing [sent. 1611 len. 9]: What do you think about it now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1612 len. 11]: `` Oh , well , you can collect it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1613 len. 5]: `` And keep it ?
Parsing [sent. 1614 len. 7]: Is that what you mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1615 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1616 len. 7]: `` Well , this is odd .
Parsing [sent. 1617 len. 13]: You 're one of those sort they call eccentrics , I judge .
Parsing [sent. 1618 len. 21]: The saying is , you must n't judge a man by his clothes , and I 'm believing it now .
Parsing [sent. 1619 len. 20]: Why yours are looking just ratty , do n't you know ; and yet you must be rich . ''
Parsing [sent. 1620 len. 5]: `` I am . ''
Parsing [sent. 1621 len. 16]: The young man walked slowly back to the town , deeply musing as he went .
Parsing [sent. 1622 len. 30]: He halted a moment in front of the best restaurant , then glanced at his clothes and passed on , and got his breakfast at a `` stand-up . ''
Parsing [sent. 1623 len. 14]: There was a good deal of it , and it cost five shillings .
Parsing [sent. 1624 len. 34]: He tendered a sovereign , got his change , glanced at his silver , muttered to himself , `` There is n't enough to buy clothes with , '' and went his way .
Parsing [sent. 1625 len. 24]: At half-past nine the richest wool-broker in Sydney was sitting in his morning-room at home , settling his breakfast with the morning paper .
Parsing [sent. 1626 len. 25]: A servant put his head in and said : `` There 's a sundowner at the door wants to see you , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 1627 len. 13]: `` What do you bring that kind of a message here for ?
Parsing [sent. 1628 len. 7]: Send him about his business . ''
Parsing [sent. 1629 len. 8]: `` He wo n't go , sir .
Parsing [sent. 1630 len. 5]: I 've tried . ''
Parsing [sent. 1631 len. 6]: `` He wo n't go ?
Parsing [sent. 1632 len. 9]: That 's -- why , that 's unusual .
Parsing [sent. 1633 len. 20]: He 's one of two things , then : he 's a remarkable person , or he 's crazy .
Parsing [sent. 1634 len. 5]: Is he crazy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1635 len. 5]: `` No , sir .
Parsing [sent. 1636 len. 7]: He do n't look it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1637 len. 6]: `` Then he 's remarkable .
Parsing [sent. 1638 len. 8]: What does he say he wants ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1639 len. 16]: `` He wo n't tell , sir ; only says it 's very important . ''
Parsing [sent. 1640 len. 6]: `` And wo n't go .
Parsing [sent. 1641 len. 9]: Does he say he wo n't go ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1642 len. 20]: `` Says he 'll stand there till he sees you , sir , if it 's all day . ''
Parsing [sent. 1643 len. 7]: `` And yet is n't crazy .
Parsing [sent. 1644 len. 5]: Show him up . ''
Parsing [sent. 1645 len. 6]: The sundowner was shown in .
Parsing [sent. 1646 len. 29]: The broker said to himself , `` No , he 's not crazy ; that is easy to see ; so he must be the other thing . ''
Parsing [sent. 1647 len. 28]: Then aloud , `` Well , my good fellow , be quick about it ; do n't waste any words ; what is it you want ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1648 len. 11]: `` I want to borrow a hundred thousand pounds . ''
Parsing [sent. 1649 len. 3]: `` Scott !
Parsing [sent. 1650 len. 13]: -LRB- It 's a mistake ; he is crazy . . . .
Parsing [sent. 1651 len. 13]: No -- he ca n't be -- not with that eye . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 1652 len. 8]: Why , you take my breath away .
Parsing [sent. 1653 len. 7]: Come , who are you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1654 len. 7]: `` Nobody that you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 1655 len. 7]: `` What is your name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1656 len. 5]: `` Cecil Rhodes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1657 len. 12]: `` No , I do n't remember hearing the name before .
Parsing [sent. 1658 len. 21]: Now then -- just for curiosity 's sake -- what has sent you to me on this extraordinary errand ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1659 len. 23]: `` The intention to make a hundred thousand pounds for you and as much for myself within the next sixty days . ''
Parsing [sent. 1660 len. 7]: `` Well , well , well .
Parsing [sent. 1661 len. 15]: It is the most extraordinary idea that -- sit down -- you interest me .
Parsing [sent. 1662 len. 19]: And somehow you -- well , you fascinate me ; I think that that is about the word .
Parsing [sent. 1663 len. 42]: And it is n't your proposition -- no , that does n't fascinate me ; it 's something else , I do n't quite know what ; something that 's born in you and oozes out of you , I suppose .
Parsing [sent. 1664 len. 31]: Now then just for curiosity 's sake again , nothing more : as I understand it , it is your desire to bor -- '' `` I said intention . ''
Parsing [sent. 1665 len. 7]: `` Pardon , so you did .
Parsing [sent. 1666 len. 22]: I thought it was an unheedful use of the word -- an unheedful valuing of its strength , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 1667 len. 7]: `` I knew its strength . ''
Parsing [sent. 1668 len. 37]: `` Well , I must say -- but look here , let me walk the floor a little , my mind is getting into a sort of whirl , though you do n't seem disturbed any .
Parsing [sent. 1669 len. 29]: -LRB- Plainly this young fellow is n't crazy ; but as to his being remarkable -- well , really he amounts to that , and something over . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 1670 len. 14]: Now then , I believe I am beyond the reach of further astonishment .
Parsing [sent. 1671 len. 6]: Strike , and spare not .
Parsing [sent. 1672 len. 6]: What is your scheme ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1673 len. 13]: `` To buy the wool crop -- deliverable in sixty days . ''
Parsing [sent. 1674 len. 9]: `` What , the whole of it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1675 len. 7]: `` The whole of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1676 len. 17]: `` No , I was not quite out of the reach of surprises , after all .
Parsing [sent. 1677 len. 6]: Why , how you talk !
Parsing [sent. 1678 len. 13]: Do you know what our crop is going to foot up ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1679 len. 14]: `` Two and a half million sterling -- maybe a little more . ''
Parsing [sent. 1680 len. 13]: `` Well , you 've got your statistics right , any way .
Parsing [sent. 1681 len. 22]: Now , then , do you know what the margins would foot up , to buy it at sixty days ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1682 len. 12]: `` The hundred thousand pounds I came here to get . ''
Parsing [sent. 1683 len. 6]: `` Right , once more .
Parsing [sent. 1684 len. 19]: Well , dear me , just to see what would happen , I wish you had the money .
Parsing [sent. 1685 len. 14]: And if you had it , what would you do with it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1686 len. 16]: `` I shall make two hundred thousand pounds out of it in sixty days . ''
Parsing [sent. 1687 len. 23]: `` You mean , of course , that you might make it if -- '' `` I said ` shall ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 1688 len. 13]: `` Yes , by George , you did say ` shall ' !
Parsing [sent. 1689 len. 16]: You are the most definite devil I ever saw , in the matter of language .
Parsing [sent. 1690 len. 9]: Dear , dear , dear , look here !
Parsing [sent. 1691 len. 7]: Definite speech means clarity of mind .
Parsing [sent. 1692 len. 43]: Upon my word I believe you 've got what you believe to be a rational reason , for venturing into this house , an entire stranger , on this wild scheme of buying the wool crop of an entire colony on speculation .
Parsing [sent. 1693 len. 17]: Bring it out -- I am prepared -- acclimatized , if I may use the word .
Parsing [sent. 1694 len. 18]: Why would you buy the crop , and why would you make that sum out of it ?
Parsing [sent. 1695 len. 22]: That is to say , what makes you think you -- '' `` I do n't think -- I know . ''
Parsing [sent. 1696 len. 4]: `` Definite again .
Parsing [sent. 1697 len. 6]: How do you know ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1698 len. 18]: `` Because France has declared war against Germany , and wool has gone up fourteen per cent .
Parsing [sent. 1699 len. 8]: in London and is still rising . ''
Parsing [sent. 1700 len. 5]: `` Oh , in-deed ?
Parsing [sent. 1701 len. 8]: Now then , I 've got you !
Parsing [sent. 1702 len. 34]: Such a thunderbolt as you have just let fly ought to have made me jump out of my chair , but it did n't stir me the least little bit , you see .
Parsing [sent. 1703 len. 14]: And for a very simple reason : I have read the morning paper .
Parsing [sent. 1704 len. 10]: You can look at it if you want to .
Parsing [sent. 1705 len. 19]: The fastest ship in the service arrived at eleven o'clock last night , fifty days out from London .
Parsing [sent. 1706 len. 7]: All her news is printed here .
Parsing [sent. 1707 len. 23]: There are no war-clouds anywhere ; and as for wool , why , it is the low-spiritedest commodity in the English market .
Parsing [sent. 1708 len. 12]: It is your turn to jump , now . . . .
Parsing [sent. 1709 len. 9]: Well , why , do n't you jump ?
Parsing [sent. 1710 len. 21]: Why do you sit there in that placid fashion , when -- '' `` Because I have later news . ''
Parsing [sent. 1711 len. 4]: `` Later news ?
Parsing [sent. 1712 len. 29]: Oh , come -- later news than fifty days , brought steaming hot from London by the -- '' `` My news is only ten days old . ''
Parsing [sent. 1713 len. 10]: `` Oh , Mun-chausen , hear the maniac talk !
Parsing [sent. 1714 len. 7]: Where did you get it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1715 len. 9]: `` Got it out of a shark . ''
Parsing [sent. 1716 len. 12]: `` Oh , oh , oh , this is too much !
Parsing [sent. 1717 len. 2]: Front !
Parsing [sent. 1718 len. 11]: call the police bring the gun -- raise the town !
Parsing [sent. 1719 len. 19]: All the asylums in Christendom have broken loose in the single person of -- '' `` Sit down !
Parsing [sent. 1720 len. 4]: And collect yourself .
Parsing [sent. 1721 len. 8]: Where is the use in getting excited ?
Parsing [sent. 1722 len. 4]: Am I excited ?
Parsing [sent. 1723 len. 8]: There is nothing to get excited about .
Parsing [sent. 1724 len. 33]: When I make a statement which I can not prove , it will be time enough for you to begin to offer hospitality to damaging fancies about me and my sanity . ''
Parsing [sent. 1725 len. 9]: `` Oh , a thousand , thousand pardons !
Parsing [sent. 1726 len. 49]: I ought to be ashamed of myself , and I am ashamed of myself for thinking that a little bit of a circumstance like sending a shark to England to fetch back a market report -- '' `` What does your middle initial stand for , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1727 len. 3]: `` Andrew .
Parsing [sent. 1728 len. 6]: What are you writing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1729 len. 5]: `` Wait a moment .
Parsing [sent. 1730 len. 9]: Proof about the shark -- and another matter .
Parsing [sent. 1731 len. 4]: Only ten lines .
Parsing [sent. 1732 len. 7]: There -- now it is done .
Parsing [sent. 1733 len. 4]: Sign it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1734 len. 6]: `` Many thanks -- many .
Parsing [sent. 1735 len. 17]: Let me see ; it says -- it says oh , come , this is interesting !
Parsing [sent. 1736 len. 7]: Why -- why -- look here !
Parsing [sent. 1737 len. 33]: prove what you say here , and I 'll put up the money , and double as much , if necessary , and divide the winnings with you , half and half .
Parsing [sent. 1738 len. 16]: There , now -- I 've signed ; make your promise good if you can .
Parsing [sent. 1739 len. 14]: Show me a copy of the London Times only ten days old . ''
Parsing [sent. 1740 len. 23]: `` Here it is -- and with it these buttons and a memorandum book that belonged to the man the shark swallowed .
Parsing [sent. 1741 len. 102]: Swallowed him in the Thames , without a doubt ; for you will notice that the last entry in the book is dated ` London , ' and is of the same date as the Times , and says , ` Ber confequentz der Kreigeseflarun , reife ich heute nach Deutchland ab , aur bak ich mein leben auf dem Ultar meines Landes legen mag ' -- , as clean native German as anybody can put upon paper , and means that in consequence of the declaration of war , this loyal soul is leaving for home to-day , to fight .
Parsing [sent. 1742 len. 22]: And he did leave , too , but the shark had him before the day was done , poor fellow . ''
Parsing [sent. 1743 len. 7]: `` And a pity , too .
Parsing [sent. 1744 len. 24]: But there are times for mourning , and we will attend to this case further on ; other matters are pressing , now .
Parsing [sent. 1745 len. 19]: I will go down and set the machinery in motion in a quiet way and buy the crop .
Parsing [sent. 1746 len. 15]: It will cheer the drooping spirits of the boys , in a transitory way .
Parsing [sent. 1747 len. 7]: Everything is transitory in this world .
Parsing [sent. 1748 len. 23]: Sixty days hence , when they are called to deliver the goods , they will think they 've been struck by lightning .
Parsing [sent. 1749 len. 21]: But there is a time for mourning , and we will attend to that case along with the other one .
Parsing [sent. 1750 len. 11]: Come along , I 'll take you to my tailor .
Parsing [sent. 1751 len. 9]: What did you say your name is ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1752 len. 5]: `` Cecil Rhodes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1753 len. 7]: `` It is hard to remember .
Parsing [sent. 1754 len. 17]: However , I think you will make it easier by and by , if you live .
Parsing [sent. 1755 len. 16]: There are three kinds of people -- Commonplace Men , Remarkable Men , and Lunatics .
Parsing [sent. 1756 len. 14]: I 'll classify you with the Remarkables , and take the chances . ''
Parsing [sent. 1757 len. 18]: The deal went through , and secured to the young stranger the first fortune he ever pocketed .
Parsing [sent. 1758 len. 23]: The people of Sydney ought to be afraid of the sharks , but for some reason they do not seem to be .
Parsing [sent. 1759 len. 23]: On Saturdays the young men go out in their boats , and sometimes the water is fairly covered with the little sails .
Parsing [sent. 1760 len. 40]: A boat upsets now and then , by accident , a result of tumultuous skylarking ; sometimes the boys upset their boat for fun -- such as it is with sharks visibly waiting around for just such an occurrence .
Parsing [sent. 1761 len. 12]: The young fellows scramble aboard whole -- sometimes -- not always .
Parsing [sent. 1762 len. 7]: Tragedies have happened more than once .
Parsing [sent. 1763 len. 55]: While I was in Sydney it was reported that a boy fell out of a boat in the mouth of the Paramatta river and screamed for help and a boy jumped overboard from another boat to save him from the assembling sharks ; but the sharks made swift work with the lives of both .
Parsing [sent. 1764 len. 44]: The government pays a bounty for the shark ; to get the bounty the fishermen bait the hook or the seine with agreeable mutton ; the news spreads and the sharks come from all over the Pacific Ocean to get the free board .
Parsing [sent. 1765 len. 17]: In time the shark culture will be one of the most successful things in the colony .
Parsing [sent. 1766 len. 3]: CHAPTER XIV .
Parsing [sent. 1767 len. 37]: We can secure other people 's approval , if we do right and try hard ; but our own is worth a hundred of it , and no way has been found out of securing that .
Parsing [sent. 1768 len. 9]: -- Pudd ` nhead Wilson 's New Calendar .
Parsing [sent. 1769 len. 35]: My health had broken down in New York in May ; it had remained in a doubtful but fairish condition during a succeeding period of 82 days ; it broke again on the Pacific .
Parsing [sent. 1770 len. 25]: It broke again in Sydney , but not until after I had had a good outing , and had also filled my lecture engagements .
Parsing [sent. 1771 len. 11]: This latest break lost me the chance of seeing Queensland .
Parsing [sent. 1772 len. 14]: In the circumstances , to go north toward hotter weather was not advisable .
Parsing [sent. 1773 len. 37]: So we moved south with a westward slant , 17 hours by rail to the capital of the colony of Victoria , Melbourne -- that juvenile city of sixty years , and half a million inhabitants .
Parsing [sent. 1774 len. 26]: On the map the distance looked small ; but that is a trouble with all divisions of distance in such a vast country as Australia .
Parsing [sent. 1775 len. 34]: The colony of Victoria itself looks small on the map -- looks like a county , in fact -- yet it is about as large as England , Scotland , and Wales combined .
Parsing [sent. 1776 len. 33]: Or , to get another focus upon it , it is just 80 times as large as the state of Rhode Island , and one-third as large as the State of Texas .
Parsing [sent. 1777 len. 25]: Outside of Melbourne , Victoria seems to be owned by a handful of squatters , each with a Rhode Island for a sheep farm .
Parsing [sent. 1778 len. 30]: That is the impression which one gathers from common talk , yet the wool industry of Victoria is by no means so great as that of New South Wales .
Parsing [sent. 1779 len. 21]: The climate of Victoria is favorable to other great industries -- among others , wheat-growing and the making of wine .
Parsing [sent. 1780 len. 13]: We took the train at Sydney at about four in the afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 1781 len. 40]: It was American in one way , for we had a most rational sleeping car ; also the car was clean and fine and new -- nothing about it to suggest the rolling stock of the continent of Europe .
Parsing [sent. 1782 len. 12]: But our baggage was weighed , and extra weight charged for .
Parsing [sent. 1783 len. 4]: That was continental .
Parsing [sent. 1784 len. 4]: Continental and troublesome .
Parsing [sent. 1785 len. 16]: Any detail of railroading that is not troublesome can not honorably be described as continental .
Parsing [sent. 1786 len. 26]: The tickets were round-trip ones -- to Melbourne , and clear to Adelaide in South Australia , and then all the way back to Sydney .
Parsing [sent. 1787 len. 51]: Twelve hundred more miles than we really expected to make ; but then as the round trip would n't cost much more than the single trip , it seemed well enough to buy as many miles as one could afford , even if one was not likely to need them .
Parsing [sent. 1788 len. 18]: A human being has a natural desire to have more of a good thing than he needs .
Parsing [sent. 1789 len. 25]: Now comes a singular thing : the oddest thing , the strangest thing , the most baffling and unaccountable marvel that Australasia can show .
Parsing [sent. 1790 len. 49]: At the frontier between New South Wales and Victoria our multitude of passengers were routed out of their snug beds by lantern-light in the morning in the biting-cold of a high altitude to change cars on a road that has no break in it from Sydney to Melbourne !
Parsing [sent. 1791 len. 25]: Think of the paralysis of intellect that gave that idea birth ; imagine the boulder it emerged from on some petrified legislator 's shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 1792 len. 17]: It is a narrow-gage road to the frontier , and a broader gauge thence to Melbourne .
Parsing [sent. 1793 len. 16]: The two governments were the builders of the road and are the owners of it .
Parsing [sent. 1794 len. 13]: One or two reasons are given for this curious state of things .
Parsing [sent. 1795 len. 21]: One is , that it represents the jealousy existing between the colonies -- the two most important colonies of Australasia .
Parsing [sent. 1796 len. 10]: What the other one is , I have forgotten .
Parsing [sent. 1797 len. 7]: But it is of no consequence .
Parsing [sent. 1798 len. 11]: It could be but another effort to explain the inexplicable .
Parsing [sent. 1799 len. 37]: All passengers fret at the double-gauge ; all shippers of freight must of course fret at it ; unnecessary expense , delay , and annoyance are imposed upon everybody concerned , and no one is benefitted .
Parsing [sent. 1800 len. 13]: Each Australian colony fences itself off from its neighbor with a custom-house .
Parsing [sent. 1801 len. 20]: Personally , I have no objection , but it must be a good deal of inconvenience to the people .
Parsing [sent. 1802 len. 18]: We have something resembling it here and there in America , but it goes by another name .
Parsing [sent. 1803 len. 31]: The large empire of the Pacific coast requires a world of iron machinery , and could manufacture it economically on the spot if the imposts on foreign iron were removed .
Parsing [sent. 1804 len. 5]: But they are not .
Parsing [sent. 1805 len. 8]: Protection to Pennsylvania and Alabama forbids it .
Parsing [sent. 1806 len. 24]: The result to the Pacific coast is the same as if there were several rows of custom-fences between the coast and the East .
Parsing [sent. 1807 len. 21]: Iron carted across the American continent at luxurious railway rates would be valuable enough to be coined when it arrived .
Parsing [sent. 1808 len. 4]: We changed cars .
Parsing [sent. 1809 len. 5]: This was at Albury .
Parsing [sent. 1810 len. 25]: And it was there , I think , that the growing day and the early sun exposed the distant range called the Blue Mountains .
Parsing [sent. 1811 len. 3]: Accurately named .
Parsing [sent. 1812 len. 5]: `` My word ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1813 len. 15]: as the Australians say , but it was a stunning color , that blue .
Parsing [sent. 1814 len. 32]: Deep , strong , rich , exquisite ; towering and majestic masses of blue -- a softly luminous blue , a smouldering blue , as if vaguely lit by fires within .
Parsing [sent. 1815 len. 18]: It extinguished the blue of the sky -- made it pallid and unwholesome , whitey and washed-out .
Parsing [sent. 1816 len. 7]: A wonderful color -- just divine .
Parsing [sent. 1817 len. 16]: A resident told me that those were not mountains ; he said they were rabbit-piles .
Parsing [sent. 1818 len. 20]: And explained that long exposure and the over-ripe condition of the rabbits was what made them look so blue .
Parsing [sent. 1819 len. 29]: This man may have been right , but much reading of books of travel has made me distrustful of gratis information furnished by unofficial residents of a country .
Parsing [sent. 1820 len. 17]: The facts which such people give to travelers are usually erroneous , and often intemperately so .
Parsing [sent. 1821 len. 30]: The rabbit-plague has indeed been very bad in Australia , and it could account for one mountain , but not for a mountain range , it seems to me .
Parsing [sent. 1822 len. 7]: It is too large an order .
Parsing [sent. 1823 len. 6]: We breakfasted at the station .
Parsing [sent. 1824 len. 11]: A good breakfast , except the coffee ; and cheap .
Parsing [sent. 1825 len. 9]: The Government establishes the prices and placards them .
Parsing [sent. 1826 len. 16]: The waiters were men , I think ; but that is not usual in Australasia .
Parsing [sent. 1827 len. 8]: The usual thing is to have girls .
Parsing [sent. 1828 len. 11]: No , not girls , young ladies -- generally duchesses .
Parsing [sent. 1829 len. 2]: Dress ?
Parsing [sent. 1830 len. 11]: They would attract attention at any royal levee in Europe .
Parsing [sent. 1831 len. 11]: Even empresses and queens do not dress as they do .
Parsing [sent. 1832 len. 17]: Not that they could not afford it , perhaps , but they would not know how .
Parsing [sent. 1833 len. 47]: All the pleasant morning we slid smoothly along over the plains , through thin -- not thick -- forests of great melancholy gum trees , with trunks rugged with curled sheets of flaking bark -- erysipelas convalescents , so to speak , shedding their dead skins .
Parsing [sent. 1834 len. 50]: And all along were tiny cabins , built sometimes of wood , sometimes of gray-blue corrugated iron ; and the doorsteps and fences were clogged with children -- rugged little simply-clad chaps that looked as if they had been imported from the banks of the Mississippi without breaking bulk .
Parsing [sent. 1835 len. 26]: And there were little villages , with neat stations well placarded with showy advertisements -- mainly of almost too self-righteous brands of `` sheepdip . ''
Parsing [sent. 1836 len. 12]: If that is the name -- and I think it is .
Parsing [sent. 1837 len. 24]: It is a stuff like tar , and is dabbed on to places where the shearer clips a piece out of the sheep .
Parsing [sent. 1838 len. 29]: It bars out the flies , and has healing properties , and a nip to it which makes the sheep skip like the cattle on a thousand hills .
Parsing [sent. 1839 len. 7]: It is not good to eat .
Parsing [sent. 1840 len. 16]: That is , it is not good to eat except when mixed with railroad coffee .
Parsing [sent. 1841 len. 5]: It improves railroad coffee .
Parsing [sent. 1842 len. 8]: Without it railroad coffee is too vague .
Parsing [sent. 1843 len. 11]: But with it , it is quite assertive and enthusiastic .
Parsing [sent. 1844 len. 21]: By itself , railroad coffee is too passive ; but sheep-dip makes it wake up and get down to business .
Parsing [sent. 1845 len. 8]: I wonder where they get railroad coffee ?
Parsing [sent. 1846 len. 25]: We saw birds , but not a kangaroo , not an emu , not an ornithorhynchus , not a lecturer , not a native .
Parsing [sent. 1847 len. 10]: Indeed , the land seemed quite destitute of game .
Parsing [sent. 1848 len. 8]: But I have misused the word native .
Parsing [sent. 1849 len. 10]: In Australia it is applied to Australian-born whites only .
Parsing [sent. 1850 len. 15]: I should have said that we saw no Aboriginals -- no `` blackfellows . ''
Parsing [sent. 1851 len. 10]: And to this day I have never seen one .
Parsing [sent. 1852 len. 28]: In the great museums you will find all the other curiosities , but in the curio of chiefest interest to the stranger all of them are lacking .
Parsing [sent. 1853 len. 17]: We have at home an abundance of museums , and not an American Indian in them .
Parsing [sent. 1854 len. 13]: It is clearly an absurdity , but it never struck me before .
Parsing [sent. 1855 len. 3]: CHAPTER XV .
Parsing [sent. 1856 len. 18]: Truth is stranger than fiction -- to some people , but I am measurably familiar with it .
Parsing [sent. 1857 len. 9]: -- Pudd ` nhead Wilson 's New Calendar .
Parsing [sent. 1858 len. 22]: Truth is stranger than fiction , but it is because Fiction is obliged to stick to possibilities ; Truth is n't .
Parsing [sent. 1859 len. 9]: -- Pudd ` nhead Wilson 's New Calendar .
Parsing [sent. 1860 len. 17]: The air was balmy and delicious , the sunshine radiant ; it was a charming excursion .
Parsing [sent. 1861 len. 28]: In the course of it we came to a town whose odd name was famous all over the world a quarter of a century ago -- Wagga-Wagga .
Parsing [sent. 1862 len. 12]: This was because the Tichborne Claimant had kept a butcher-shop there .
Parsing [sent. 1863 len. 87]: It was out of the midst of his humble collection of sausages and tripe that he soared up into the zenith of notoriety and hung there in the wastes of space a time , with the telescopes of all nations leveled at him in unappeasable curiosity -- curiosity as to which of the two long-missing persons he was : Arthur Orton , the mislaid roustabout of Wapping , or Sir Roger Tichborne , the lost heir of a name and estates as old as English history .
Parsing [sent. 1864 len. 65]: We all know now , but not a dozen people knew then ; and the dozen kept the mystery to themselves and allowed the most intricate and fascinating and marvelous real-life romance that has ever been played upon the world 's stage to unfold itself serenely , act by act , in a British court by the long and laborious processes of judicial development .
Parsing [sent. 1865 len. 37]: When we recall the details of that great romance we marvel to see what daring chances truth may freely take in constructing a tale , as compared with the poor little conservative risks permitted to fiction .
Parsing [sent. 1866 len. 15]: The fiction-artist could achieve no success with the materials of this splendid Tichborne romance .
Parsing [sent. 1867 len. 19]: He would have to drop out the chief characters ; the public would say such people are impossible .
Parsing [sent. 1868 len. 24]: He would have to drop out a number of the most picturesque incidents ; the public would say such things could never happen .
Parsing [sent. 1869 len. 14]: And yet the chief characters did exist , and the incidents did happen .
Parsing [sent. 1870 len. 29]: It cost the Tichborne estates $ 400,000 to unmask the Claimant and drive him out ; and even after the exposure multitudes of Englishmen still believed in him .
Parsing [sent. 1871 len. 50]: It cost the British Government another $ 400,000 to convict him of perjury ; and after the conviction the same old multitudes still believed in him ; and among these believers were many educated and intelligent men ; and some of them had personally known the real Sir Roger .
Parsing [sent. 1872 len. 10]: The Claimant was sentenced to 14 years ' imprisonment .
Parsing [sent. 1873 len. 28]: When he got out of prison he went to New York and kept a whisky saloon in the Bowery for a time , then disappeared from view .
Parsing [sent. 1874 len. 14]: He always claimed to be Sir Roger Tichborne until death called for him .
Parsing [sent. 1875 len. 28]: This was but a few months ago -- not very much short of a generation since he left Wagga-Wagga to go and possess himself of his estates .
Parsing [sent. 1876 len. 32]: On his death-bed he yielded up his secret , and confessed in writing that he was only Arthur Orton of Wapping , able seaman and butcher -- that and nothing more .
Parsing [sent. 1877 len. 20]: But it is scarcely to be doubted that there are people whom even his dying confession will not convince .
Parsing [sent. 1878 len. 26]: The old habit of assimilating incredibilities must have made strong food a necessity in their case ; a weaker article would probably disagree with them .
Parsing [sent. 1879 len. 13]: I was in London when the Claimant stood his trial for perjury .
Parsing [sent. 1880 len. 23]: I attended one of his showy evenings in the sumptuous quarters provided for him from the purses of his adherents and well-wishers .
Parsing [sent. 1881 len. 17]: He was in evening dress , and I thought him a rather fine and stately creature .
Parsing [sent. 1882 len. 35]: There were about twenty-five gentlemen present ; educated men , men moving in good society , none of them commonplace ; some of them were men of distinction , none of them were obscurities .
Parsing [sent. 1883 len. 8]: They were his cordial friends and admirers .
Parsing [sent. 1884 len. 39]: It was `` Sir Roger , '' always `` Sir Roger , '' on all hands ; no one withheld the title , all turned it from the tongue with unction , and as if it tasted good .
Parsing [sent. 1885 len. 11]: For many years I had had a mystery in stock .
Parsing [sent. 1886 len. 12]: Melbourne , and only Melbourne , could unriddle it for me .
Parsing [sent. 1887 len. 29]: In 1873 I arrived in London with my wife and young child , and presently received a note from Naples signed by a name not familiar to me .
Parsing [sent. 1888 len. 23]: It was not Bascom , and it was not Henry ; but I will call it Henry Bascom for convenience 's sake .
Parsing [sent. 1889 len. 21]: This note , of about six lines , was written on a strip of white paper whose end-edges were ragged .
Parsing [sent. 1890 len. 12]: I came to be familiar with those strips in later years .
Parsing [sent. 1891 len. 9]: Their size and pattern were always the same .
Parsing [sent. 1892 len. 55]: Their contents were usually to the same effect : would I and mine come to the writer 's country-place in England on such and such a date , by such and such a train , and stay twelve days and depart by such and such a train at the end of the specified time ?
Parsing [sent. 1893 len. 9]: A carriage would meet us at the station .
Parsing [sent. 1894 len. 32]: These invitations were always for a long time ahead ; if we were in Europe , three months ahead ; if we were in America , six to twelve months ahead .
Parsing [sent. 1895 len. 20]: They always named the exact date and train for the beginning and also for the end of the visit .
Parsing [sent. 1896 len. 14]: This first note invited us for a date three months in the future .
Parsing [sent. 1897 len. 16]: It asked us to arrive by the 4.10 p.m. train from London , August 6th .
Parsing [sent. 1898 len. 6]: The carriage would be waiting .
Parsing [sent. 1899 len. 11]: The carriage would take us away seven days later-train specified .
Parsing [sent. 1900 len. 13]: And there were these words : `` Speak to Tom Hughes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1901 len. 27]: I showed the note to the author of `` Tom Brown at Rugby , '' and he said : `` Accept , and be thankful . ''
Parsing [sent. 1902 len. 30]: He described Mr. Bascom as being a man of genius , a man of fine attainments , a choice man in every way , a rare and beautiful character .
Parsing [sent. 1903 len. 64]: He said that Bascom Hall was a particularly fine example of the stately manorial mansion of Elizabeth 's days , and that it was a house worth going a long way to see -- like Knowle ; that Mr. B. was of a social disposition ; liked the company of agreeable people , and always had samples of the sort coming and going .
Parsing [sent. 1904 len. 5]: We paid the visit .
Parsing [sent. 1905 len. 14]: We paid others , in later years -- the last one in 1879 .
Parsing [sent. 1906 len. 42]: Soon after that Mr. Bascom started on a voyage around the world in a steam yacht -- a long and leisurely trip , for he was making collections , in all lands , of birds , butterflies , and such things .
Parsing [sent. 1907 len. 42]: The day that President Garfield was shot by the assassin Guiteau , we were at a little watering place on Long Island Sound ; and in the mail matter of that day came a letter with the Melbourne post-mark on it .
Parsing [sent. 1908 len. 21]: It was for my wife , but I recognized Mr. Bascom 's handwriting on the envelope , and opened it .
Parsing [sent. 1909 len. 31]: It was the usual note -- as to paucity of lines -- and was written on the customary strip of paper ; but there was nothing usual about the contents .
Parsing [sent. 1910 len. 136]: The note informed my wife that if it would be any assuagement of her grief to know that her husband 's lecture-tour in Australia was a satisfactory venture from the beginning to the end , he , the writer , could testify that such was the case ; also , that her husband 's untimely death had been mourned by all classes , as she would already know by the press telegrams , long before the reception of this note ; that the funeral was attended by the officials of the colonial and city governments ; and that while he , the writer , her friend and mine , had not reached Melbourne in time to see the body , he had at least had the sad privilege of acting as one of the pall-bearers .
Parsing [sent. 1911 len. 7]: Signed , `` Henry Bascom . ''
Parsing [sent. 1912 len. 14]: My first thought was , why did n't he have the coffin opened ?
Parsing [sent. 1913 len. 43]: He would have seen that the corpse was an imposter , and he could have gone right ahead and dried up the most of those tears , and comforted those sorrowing governments , and sold the remains and sent me the money .
Parsing [sent. 1914 len. 7]: I did nothing about the matter .
Parsing [sent. 1915 len. 43]: I had set the law after living lecture doubles of mine a couple of times in America , and the law had not been able to catch them ; others in my trade had tried to catch their impostor-doubles and had failed .
Parsing [sent. 1916 len. 10]: Then where was the use in harrying a ghost ?
Parsing [sent. 1917 len. 10]: None -- and so I did not disturb it .
Parsing [sent. 1918 len. 20]: I had a curiosity to know about that man 's lecture-tour and last moments , but that could wait .
Parsing [sent. 1919 len. 14]: When I should see Mr. Bascom he would tell me all about it .
Parsing [sent. 1920 len. 14]: But he passed from life , and I never saw him again . .
Parsing [sent. 1921 len. 5]: My curiosity faded away .
Parsing [sent. 1922 len. 14]: However , when I found that I was going to Australia it revived .
Parsing [sent. 1923 len. 35]: And naturally : for if the people should say that I was a dull , poor thing compared to what I was before I died , it would have a bad effect on business .
Parsing [sent. 1924 len. 15]: Well , to my surprise the Sydney journalists had never heard of that impostor !
Parsing [sent. 1925 len. 23]: I pressed them , but they were firm -- they had never heard of him , and did n't believe in him .
Parsing [sent. 1926 len. 18]: I could not understand it ; still , I thought it would all come right in Melbourne .
Parsing [sent. 1927 len. 10]: The government would remember ; and the other mourners .
Parsing [sent. 1928 len. 17]: At the supper of the Institute of Journalists I should find out all about the matter .
Parsing [sent. 1929 len. 14]: But no -- it turned out that they had never heard of it .
Parsing [sent. 1930 len. 8]: So my mystery was a mystery still .
Parsing [sent. 1931 len. 6]: It was a great disappointment .
Parsing [sent. 1932 len. 22]: I believed it would never be cleared up -- in this life -- so I dropped it out of my mind .
Parsing [sent. 1933 len. 4]: But at last !
Parsing [sent. 1934 len. 34]: just when I was least expecting it -- However , this is not the place for the rest of it ; I shall come to the matter again , in a far-distant chapter .
Parsing [sent. 1935 len. 3]: CHAPTER XVI .
Parsing [sent. 1936 len. 13]: There is a Moral sense , and there is an Immoral Sense .
Parsing [sent. 1937 len. 34]: History shows us that the Moral Sense enables us to perceive morality and how to avoid it , and that the Immoral Sense enables us to perceive immorality and how to enjoy it .
Parsing [sent. 1938 len. 9]: - Pudd ` nhead Wilson 's New Calendar .
Parsing [sent. 1939 len. 10]: Melbourne spreads around over an immense area of ground .
Parsing [sent. 1940 len. 12]: It is a stately city architecturally as well as in magnitude .
Parsing [sent. 1941 len. 99]: It has an elaborate system of cable-car service ; it has museums , and colleges , and schools , and public gardens , and electricity , and gas , and libraries , and theaters , and mining centers , and wool centers , and centers of the arts and sciences , and boards of trade , and ships , and railroads , and a harbor , and social clubs , and journalistic clubs , and racing clubs , and a squatter club sumptuously housed and appointed , and as many churches and banks as can make a living .
Parsing [sent. 1942 len. 18]: In a word , it is equipped with everything that goes to make the modern great city .
Parsing [sent. 1943 len. 17]: It is the largest city of Australasia , and fills the post with honor and credit .
Parsing [sent. 1944 len. 16]: It has one specialty ; this must not be jumbled in with those other things .
Parsing [sent. 1945 len. 10]: It is the mitred Metropolitan of the Horse-Racing Cult .
Parsing [sent. 1946 len. 8]: Its race-ground is the Mecca of Australasia .
Parsing [sent. 1947 len. 77]: On the great annual day of sacrifice -- the 5th of November , Guy Fawkes 's Day -- business is suspended over a stretch of land and sea as wide as from New York to San Francisco , and deeper than from the northern lakes to the Gulf of Mexico ; and every man and woman , of high degree or low , who can afford the expense , put away their other duties and come .
Parsing [sent. 1948 len. 59]: They begin to swarm in by ship and rail a fortnight before the day , and they swarm thicker and thicker day after day , until all the vehicles of transportation are taxed to their uttermost to meet the demands of the occasion , and all hotels and lodgings are bulging outward because of the pressure from within .
Parsing [sent. 1949 len. 37]: They come a hundred thousand strong , as all the best authorities say , and they pack the spacious grounds and grandstands and make a spectacle such as is never to be seen in Australasia elsewhere .
Parsing [sent. 1950 len. 13]: It is the `` Melbourne Cup '' that brings this multitude together .
Parsing [sent. 1951 len. 38]: Their clothes have been ordered long ago , at unlimited cost , and without bounds as to beauty and magnificence , and have been kept in concealment until now , for unto this day are they consecrate .
Parsing [sent. 1952 len. 15]: I am speaking of the ladies ' clothes ; but one might know that .
Parsing [sent. 1953 len. 21]: And so the grand-stands make a brilliant and wonderful spectacle , a delirium of color , a vision of beauty .
Parsing [sent. 1954 len. 28]: The champagne flows , everybody is vivacious , excited , happy ; everybody bets , and gloves and fortunes change hands right along , all the time .
Parsing [sent. 1955 len. 44]: Day after day the races go on , and the fun and the excitement are kept at white heat ; and when each day is done , the people dance all night so as to be fresh for the race in the morning .
Parsing [sent. 1956 len. 73]: And at the end of the great week the swarms secure lodgings and transportation for next year , then flock away to their remote homes and count their gains and losses , and order next year 's Cup-clothes , and then lie down and sleep two weeks , and get up sorry to reflect that a whole year must be put in somehow or other before they can be wholly happy again .
Parsing [sent. 1957 len. 9]: The Melbourne Cup is the Australasian National Day .
Parsing [sent. 1958 len. 9]: It would be difficult to overstate its importance .
Parsing [sent. 1959 len. 17]: It overshadows all other holidays and specialized days of whatever sort in that congeries of colonies .
Parsing [sent. 1960 len. 3]: Overshadows them ?
Parsing [sent. 1961 len. 9]: I might almost say it blots them out .
Parsing [sent. 1962 len. 64]: Each of them gets attention , but not everybody 's ; each of them evokes interest , but not everybody 's ; each of them rouses enthusiasm , but not everybody 's ; in each case a part of the attention , interest , and enthusiasm is a matter of habit and custom , and another part of it is official and perfunctory .
Parsing [sent. 1963 len. 28]: Cup Day , and Cup Day only , commands an attention , an interest , and an enthusiasm which are universal -- and spontaneous , not perfunctory .
Parsing [sent. 1964 len. 10]: Cup Day is supreme -- it has no rival .
Parsing [sent. 1965 len. 25]: I can call to mind no specialized annual day , in any country , which can be named by that large name -- Supreme .
Parsing [sent. 1966 len. 32]: I can call to mind no specialized annual day , in any country , whose approach fires the whole land with a conflagration of conversation and preparation and anticipation and jubilation .
Parsing [sent. 1967 len. 12]: No day save this one ; but this one does it .
Parsing [sent. 1968 len. 19]: In America we have no annual supreme day ; no day whose approach makes the whole nation glad .
Parsing [sent. 1969 len. 13]: We have the Fourth of July , and Christmas , and Thanksgiving .
Parsing [sent. 1970 len. 22]: Neither of them can claim the primacy ; neither of them can arouse an enthusiasm which comes near to being universal .
Parsing [sent. 1971 len. 32]: Eight grown Americans out of ten dread the coming of the Fourth , with its pandemonium and its perils , and they rejoice when it is gone -- if still alive .
Parsing [sent. 1972 len. 13]: The approach of Christmas brings harassment and dread to many excellent people .
Parsing [sent. 1973 len. 58]: They have to buy a cart-load of presents , and they never know what to buy to hit the various tastes ; they put in three weeks of hard and anxious work , and when Christmas morning comes they are so dissatisfied with the result , and so disappointed that they want to sit down and cry .
Parsing [sent. 1974 len. 12]: Then they give thanks that Christmas comes but once a year .
Parsing [sent. 1975 len. 17]: The observance of Thanksgiving Day -- as a function -- has become general of late years .
Parsing [sent. 1976 len. 7]: The Thankfulness is not so general .
Parsing [sent. 1977 len. 4]: This is natural .
Parsing [sent. 1978 len. 27]: Two-thirds of the nation have always had hard luck and a hard time during the year , and this has a calming effect upon their enthusiasm .
Parsing [sent. 1979 len. 32]: We have a supreme day -- a sweeping and tremendous and tumultuous day , a day which commands an absolute universality of interest and excitement ; but it is not annual .
Parsing [sent. 1980 len. 21]: It comes but once in four years ; therefore it can not count as a rival of the Melbourne Cup .
Parsing [sent. 1981 len. 18]: In Great Britain and Ireland they have two great days -- Christmas and the Queen 's birthday .
Parsing [sent. 1982 len. 11]: But they are equally popular ; there is no supremacy .
Parsing [sent. 1983 len. 31]: I think it must be conceded that the position of the Australasian Day is unique , solitary , unfellowed ; and likely to hold that high place a long time .
Parsing [sent. 1984 len. 32]: The next things which interest us when we travel are , first , the people ; next , the novelties ; and finally the history of the places and countries visited .
Parsing [sent. 1985 len. 16]: Novelties are rare in cities which represent the most advanced civilization of the modern day .
Parsing [sent. 1986 len. 25]: When one is familiar with such cities in the other parts of the world he is in effect familiar with the cities of Australasia .
Parsing [sent. 1987 len. 10]: The outside aspects will furnish little that is new .
Parsing [sent. 1988 len. 24]: There will be new names , but the things which they represent will sometimes be found to be less new than their names .
Parsing [sent. 1989 len. 25]: There may be shades of difference , but these can easily be too fine for detection by the incompetent eye of the passing stranger .
Parsing [sent. 1990 len. 42]: In the larrikin he will not be able to discover a new species , but only an old one met elsewhere , and variously called loafer , rough , tough , bummer , or blatherskite , according to his geographical distribution .
Parsing [sent. 1991 len. 35]: The larrikin differs by a shade from those others , in that he is more sociable toward the stranger than they , more kindly disposed , more hospitable , more hearty , more friendly .
Parsing [sent. 1992 len. 15]: At least it seemed so to me , and I had opportunity to observe .
Parsing [sent. 1993 len. 6]: In Sydney , at least .
Parsing [sent. 1994 len. 27]: In Melbourne I had to drive to and from the lecture-theater , but in Sydney I was able to walk both ways , and did it .
Parsing [sent. 1995 len. 45]: Every night , on my way home at ten , or a quarter past , I found the larrikin grouped in considerable force at several of the street corners , and he always gave me this pleasant salutation : `` Hello , Mark ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1996 len. 9]: `` Here 's to you , old chap !
Parsing [sent. 1997 len. 5]: `` Say -- Mark !
Parsing [sent. 1998 len. 6]: -- is he dead ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1999 len. 28]: -- a reference to a passage in some book of mine , though I did not detect , at that time , that that was its source .
Parsing [sent. 2000 len. 38]: And I did n't detect it afterward in Melbourne , when I came on the stage for the first time , and the same question was dropped down upon me from the dizzy height of the gallery .
Parsing [sent. 2001 len. 25]: It is always difficult to answer a sudden inquiry like that , when you have come unprepared and do n't know what it means .
Parsing [sent. 2002 len. 46]: I will remark here -- if it is not an indecorum -- that the welcome which an American lecturer gets from a British colonial audience is a thing which will move him to his deepest deeps , and veil his sight and break his voice .
Parsing [sent. 2003 len. 30]: And from Winnipeg to Africa , experience will teach him nothing ; he will never learn to expect it , it will catch him as a surprise each time .
Parsing [sent. 2004 len. 14]: The war-cloud hanging black over England and America made no trouble for me .
Parsing [sent. 2005 len. 31]: I was a prospective prisoner of war , but at dinners , suppers , on the platform , and elsewhere , there was never anything to remind me of it .
Parsing [sent. 2006 len. 22]: This was hospitality of the right metal , and would have been prominently lacking in some countries , in the circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 2007 len. 23]: And speaking of the war-flurry , it seemed to me to bring to light the unexpected , in a detail or two .
Parsing [sent. 2008 len. 43]: It seemed to relegate the war-talk to the politicians on both sides of the water ; whereas whenever a prospective war between two nations had been in the air theretofore , the public had done most of the talking and the bitterest .
Parsing [sent. 2009 len. 9]: The attitude of the newspapers was new also .
Parsing [sent. 2010 len. 17]: I speak of those of Australasia and India , for I had access to those only .
Parsing [sent. 2011 len. 15]: They treated the subject argumentatively and with dignity , not with spite and anger .
Parsing [sent. 2012 len. 24]: That was a new spirit , too , and not learned of the French and German press , either before Sedan or since .
Parsing [sent. 2013 len. 15]: I heard many public speeches , and they reflected the moderation of the journals .
Parsing [sent. 2014 len. 28]: The outlook is that the English-speaking race will dominate the earth a hundred years from now , if its sections do not get to fighting each other .
Parsing [sent. 2015 len. 30]: It would be a pity to spoil that prospect by baffling and retarding wars when arbitration would settle their differences so much better and also so much more definitely .
Parsing [sent. 2016 len. 18]: No , as I have suggested , novelties are rare in the great capitals of modern times .
Parsing [sent. 2017 len. 19]: Even the wool exchange in Melbourne could not be told from the familiar stock exchange of other countries .
Parsing [sent. 2018 len. 47]: Wool brokers are just like stockbrokers ; they all bounce from their seats and put up their hands and yell in unison -- no stranger can tell what -- and the president calmly says `` Sold to Smith & Co. , threpence farthing -- next ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2019 len. 15]: -- when probably nothing of the kind happened ; for how should he know ?
Parsing [sent. 2020 len. 44]: In the museums you will find acres of the most strange and fascinating things ; but all museums are fascinating , and they do so tire your eyes , and break your back , and burn out your vitalities with their consuming interest .
Parsing [sent. 2021 len. 14]: You always say you will never go again , but you do go .
Parsing [sent. 2022 len. 35]: The palaces of the rich , in Melbourne , are much like the palaces of the rich in America , and the life in them is the same ; but there the resemblance ends .
Parsing [sent. 2023 len. 43]: The grounds surrounding the American palace are not often large , and not often beautiful , but in the Melbourne case the grounds are often ducally spacious , and the climate and the gardeners together make them as beautiful as a dream .
Parsing [sent. 2024 len. 50]: It is said that some of the country seats have grounds -- domains -- about them which rival in charm and magnitude those which surround the country mansion of an English lord ; but I was not out in the country ; I had my hands full in town .
Parsing [sent. 2025 len. 20]: And what was the origin of this majestic city and its efflorescence of palatial town houses and country seats ?
Parsing [sent. 2026 len. 15]: Its first brick was laid and its first house built by a passing convict .
Parsing [sent. 2027 len. 42]: Australian history is almost always picturesque ; indeed , it is so curious and strange , that it is itself the chiefest novelty the country has to offer , and so it pushes the other novelties into second and third place .
Parsing [sent. 2028 len. 14]: It does not read like history , but like the most beautiful lies .
Parsing [sent. 2029 len. 14]: And all of a fresh new sort , no mouldy old stale ones .
Parsing [sent. 2030 len. 28]: It is full of surprises , and adventures , and incongruities , and contradictions , and incredibilities ; but they are all true , they all happened .
Parsing [sent. 2031 len. 3]: CHAPTER XVII .
Parsing [sent. 2032 len. 20]: The English are mentioned in the Bible : Blessed are the meek , for they shall inherit the earth .
Parsing [sent. 2033 len. 9]: -- Pudd ` nhead Wilson 's New Calendar .
Parsing [sent. 2034 len. 41]: When we consider the immensity of the British Empire in territory , population , and trade , it requires a stern exercise of faith to believe in the figures which represent Australasia 's contribution to the Empire 's commercial grandeur .
Parsing [sent. 2035 len. 31]: As compared with the landed estate of the British Empire , the landed estate dominated by any other Power except one -- Russia -- is not very impressive for size .
Parsing [sent. 2036 len. 18]: My authorities make the British Empire not much short of a fourth larger than the Russian Empire .
Parsing [sent. 2037 len. 45]: Roughly proportioned , if you will allow your entire hand to represent the British Empire , you may then cut off the fingers a trifle above the middle joint of the middle finger , and what is left of the hand will represent Russia .
Parsing [sent. 2038 len. 16]: The populations ruled by Great Britain and China are about the same -- 400,000,000 each .
Parsing [sent. 2039 len. 7]: No other Power approaches these figures .
Parsing [sent. 2040 len. 7]: Even Russia is left far behind .
Parsing [sent. 2041 len. 23]: The population of Australasia -- 4,000,000 -- sinks into nothingness , and is lost from sight in that British ocean of 400,000,000 .
Parsing [sent. 2042 len. 27]: Yet the statistics indicate that it rises again and shows up very conspicuously when its share of the Empire 's commerce is the matter under consideration .
Parsing [sent. 2043 len. 26]: The value of England 's annual exports and imports is stated at three billions of dollars , -- -LSB- New South Wales Blue Book . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 2044 len. 26]: -- and it is claimed that more than one-tenth of this great aggregate is represented by Australasia 's exports to England and imports from England .
Parsing [sent. 2045 len. 37]: In addition to this , Australasia does a trade with countries other than England , amounting to a hundred million dollars a year , and a domestic intercolonial trade amounting to a hundred and fifty millions .
Parsing [sent. 2046 len. 17]: In round numbers the 4,000,000 buy and sell about $ 600,000,000 worth of goods a year .
Parsing [sent. 2047 len. 14]: It is claimed that about half of this represents commodities of Australasian production .
Parsing [sent. 2048 len. 14]: The products exported annually by India are worth a trifle over $ 500,000,000 .
Parsing [sent. 2049 len. 18]: Now , here are some faith-straining figures : Indian production -LRB- 300,000,000 population -RRB- , $ 500,000,000 .
Parsing [sent. 2050 len. 10]: Australasian production -LRB- 4,000,000 population -RRB- , $ 300,000,000 .
Parsing [sent. 2051 len. 40]: That is to say , the product of the individual Indian , annually -LRB- for export some whither -RRB- , is worth $ 1.75 ; that of the individual Australasian -LRB- for export some whither -RRB- , $ 75 !
Parsing [sent. 2052 len. 38]: Or , to put it in another way , the Indian family of man and wife and three children sends away an annual result worth $ 8.75 , while the Australasian family sends away $ 375 worth .
Parsing [sent. 2053 len. 46]: There are trustworthy statistics furnished by Sir Richard Temple and others , which show that the individual Indian 's whole annual product , both for export and home use , is worth in gold only $ 7.50 ; or , $ 37.50 for the family-aggregate .
Parsing [sent. 2054 len. 21]: Ciphered out on a like ratio of multiplication , the Australasian family 's aggregate production would be nearly $ 1,600 .
Parsing [sent. 2055 len. 15]: Truly , nothing is so astonishing as figures , if they once get started .
Parsing [sent. 2056 len. 22]: We left Melbourne by rail for Adelaide , the capital of the vast Province of South Australia -- a seventeen-hour excursion .
Parsing [sent. 2057 len. 37]: On the train we found several Sydney friends ; among them a Judge who was going out on circuit , and was going to hold court at Broken Hill , where the celebrated silver mine is .
Parsing [sent. 2058 len. 13]: It seemed a curious road to take to get to that region .
Parsing [sent. 2059 len. 21]: Broken Hill is close to the western border of New South Wales , and Sydney is on the eastern border .
Parsing [sent. 2060 len. 33]: A fairly straight line , 700 miles long , drawn westward from Sydney , would strike Broken Hill , just as a somewhat shorter one drawn west from Boston would strike Buffalo .
Parsing [sent. 2061 len. 51]: The way the Judge was traveling would carry him over 2,000 miles by rail , he said ; southwest from Sydney down to Melbourne , then northward up to Adelaide , then a cant back northeastward and over the border into New South Wales once more -- to Broken Hill .
Parsing [sent. 2062 len. 36]: It was like going from Boston southwest to Richmond , Virginia , then northwest up to Erie , Pennsylvania , then a cant back northeast and over the border -- to Buffalo , New York .
Parsing [sent. 2063 len. 6]: But the explanation was simple .
Parsing [sent. 2064 len. 17]: Years ago the fabulously rich silver discovery at Broken Hill burst suddenly upon an unexpectant world .
Parsing [sent. 2065 len. 18]: Its stocks started at shillings , and went by leaps and bounds to the most fanciful figures .
Parsing [sent. 2066 len. 82]: It was one of those cases where the cook puts a month 's wages into shares , and comes next month and buys your house at your own price , and moves into it herself ; where the coachman takes a few shares , and next month sets up a bank ; and where the common sailor invests the price of a spree , and the next month buys out the steamship company and goes into business on his own hook .
Parsing [sent. 2067 len. 34]: In a word , it was one of those excitements which bring multitudes of people to a common center with a rush , and whose needs must be supplied , and at once .
Parsing [sent. 2068 len. 10]: Adelaide was close by , Sydney was far away .
Parsing [sent. 2069 len. 31]: Adelaide threw a short railway across the border before Sydney had time to arrange for a long one ; it was not worth while for Sydney to arrange at all .
Parsing [sent. 2070 len. 15]: The whole vast trade-profit of Broken Hill fell into Adelaide 's hands , irrevocably .
Parsing [sent. 2071 len. 34]: New South Wales furnishes law for Broken Hill and sends her Judges 2,000 miles -- mainly through alien countries -- to administer it , but Adelaide takes the dividends and makes no moan .
Parsing [sent. 2072 len. 16]: We started at 4.20 in the afternoon , and moved across level plains until night .
Parsing [sent. 2073 len. 26]: In the morning we had a stretch of `` scrub '' country -- the kind of thing which is so useful to the Australian novelist .
Parsing [sent. 2074 len. 42]: In the scrub the hostile aboriginal lurks , and flits mysteriously about , slipping out from time to time to surprise and slaughter the settler ; then slipping back again , and leaving no track that the white man can follow .
Parsing [sent. 2075 len. 73]: In the scrub the novelist 's heroine gets lost , search fails of result ; she wanders here and there , and finally sinks down exhausted and unconscious , and the searchers pass within a yard or two of her , not suspecting that she is near , and by and by some rambler finds her bones and the pathetic diary which she had scribbled with her failing hand and left behind .
Parsing [sent. 2076 len. 35]: Nobody can find a lost heroine in the scrub but the aboriginal `` tracker , '' and he will not lend himself to the scheme if it will interfere with the novelist 's plot .
Parsing [sent. 2077 len. 37]: The scrub stretches miles and miles in all directions , and looks like a level roof of bush-tops without a break or a crack in it -- as seamless as a blanket , to all appearance .
Parsing [sent. 2078 len. 23]: One might as well walk under water and hope to guess out a route and stick to it , I should think .
Parsing [sent. 2079 len. 21]: Yet it is claimed that the aboriginal `` tracker '' was able to hunt out people lost in the scrub .
Parsing [sent. 2080 len. 36]: Also in the `` bush '' ; also in the desert ; and even follow them over patches of bare rocks and over alluvial ground which had to all appearance been washed clear of footprints .
Parsing [sent. 2081 len. 59]: From reading Australian books and talking with the people , I became convinced that the aboriginal tracker 's performances evince a craft , a penetration , a luminous sagacity , and a minuteness and accuracy of observation in the matter of detective-work not found in nearly so remarkable a degree in any other people , white or colored .
Parsing [sent. 2082 len. 58]: In an official account of the blacks of Australia published by the government of Victoria , one reads that the aboriginal not only notices the faint marks left on the bark of a tree by the claws of a climbing opossum , but knows in some way or other whether the marks were made to-day or yesterday .
Parsing [sent. 2083 len. 43]: And there is the case , on record where A. , a settler , makes a bet with B. , that B. may lose a cow as effectually as he can , and A. will produce an aboriginal who will find her .
Parsing [sent. 2084 len. 20]: B. selects a cow and lets the tracker see the cow 's footprint , then be put under guard .
Parsing [sent. 2085 len. 58]: B. then drives the cow a few miles over a course which drifts in all directions , and frequently doubles back upon itself ; and he selects difficult ground all the time , and once or twice even drives the cow through herds of other cows , and mingles her tracks in the wide confusion of theirs .
Parsing [sent. 2086 len. 61]: He finally brings his cow home ; the aboriginal is set at liberty , and at once moves around in a great circle , examining all cow-tracks until he finds the one he is after ; then sets off and follows it throughout its erratic course , and ultimately tracks it to the stable where B. has hidden the cow .
Parsing [sent. 2087 len. 9]: Now wherein does one cow-track differ from another ?
Parsing [sent. 2088 len. 62]: There must be a difference , or the tracker could not have performed the feat ; a difference minute , shadowy , and not detectible by you or me , or by the late Sherlock Holmes , and yet discernible by a member of a race charged by some people with occupying the bottom place in the gradations of human intelligence .
Parsing [sent. 2089 len. 3]: CHAPTER XVIII .
Parsing [sent. 2090 len. 10]: It is easier to stay out than get out .
Parsing [sent. 2091 len. 9]: -- Pudd ` nhead Wilson 's New Calendar .
Parsing [sent. 2092 len. 22]: The train was now exploring a beautiful hill country , and went twisting in and out through lovely little green valleys .
Parsing [sent. 2093 len. 13]: There were several varieties of gum trees ; among them many giants .
Parsing [sent. 2094 len. 29]: Some of them were bodied and barked like the sycamore ; some were of fantastic aspect , and reminded one of the quaint apple trees in Japanese pictures .
Parsing [sent. 2095 len. 16]: And there was one peculiarly beautiful tree whose name and breed I did not know .
Parsing [sent. 2096 len. 36]: The foliage seemed to consist of big bunches of pine-spines , the lower half of each bunch a rich brown or old-gold color , the upper half a most vivid and strenuous and shouting green .
Parsing [sent. 2097 len. 6]: The effect was altogether bewitching .
Parsing [sent. 2098 len. 6]: The tree was apparently rare .
Parsing [sent. 2099 len. 23]: I should say that the first and last samples of it seen by us were not more than half an hour apart .
Parsing [sent. 2100 len. 17]: There was another tree of striking aspect , a kind of pine , we were told .
Parsing [sent. 2101 len. 27]: Its foliage was as fine as hair , apparently , and its mass sphered itself above the naked straight stem like an explosion of misty smoke .
Parsing [sent. 2102 len. 27]: It was not a sociable sort ; it did not gather in groups or couples , but each individual stood far away from its nearest neighbor .
Parsing [sent. 2103 len. 58]: It scattered itself in this spacious and exclusive fashion about the slopes of swelling grassy great knolls , and stood in the full flood of the wonderful sunshine ; and as far as you could see the tree itself you could also see the ink-black blot of its shadow on the shining green carpet at its feet .
Parsing [sent. 2104 len. 48]: On some part of this railway journey we saw gorse and broom -- importations from England -- and a gentleman who came into our compartment on a visit tried to tell me which -- was which ; but as he did n't know , he had difficulty .
Parsing [sent. 2105 len. 46]: He said he was ashamed of his ignorance , but that he had never been confronted with the question before during the fifty years and more that he had spent in Australia , and so he had never happened to get interested in the matter .
Parsing [sent. 2106 len. 9]: But there was no need to be ashamed .
Parsing [sent. 2107 len. 8]: The most of us have his defect .
Parsing [sent. 2108 len. 21]: We take a natural interest in novelties , but it is against nature to take an interest in familiar things .
Parsing [sent. 2109 len. 13]: The gorse and the broom were a fine accent in the landscape .
Parsing [sent. 2110 len. 41]: Here and there they burst out in sudden conflagrations of vivid yellow against a background of sober or sombre color , with a so startling effect as to make a body catch his breath with the happy surprise of it .
Parsing [sent. 2111 len. 21]: And then there was the wattle , a native bush or tree , an inspiring cloud of sumptuous yellow bloom .
Parsing [sent. 2112 len. 22]: It is a favorite with the Australians , and has a fine fragrance , a quality usually wanting in Australian blossoms .
Parsing [sent. 2113 len. 76]: The gentleman who enriched me with the poverty of his information about the gorse and the broom told me that he came out from England a youth of twenty and entered the Province of South Australia with thirty-six shillings in his pocket -- an adventurer without trade , profession , or friends , but with a clearly-defined purpose in his head : he would stay until he was worth L200 , then go back home .
Parsing [sent. 2114 len. 13]: He would allow himself five years for the accumulation of this fortune .
Parsing [sent. 2115 len. 13]: `` That was more than fifty years ago , '' said he .
Parsing [sent. 2116 len. 9]: `` And here I am , yet . ''
Parsing [sent. 2117 len. 32]: As he went out at the door he met a friend , and turned and introduced him to me , and the friend and I had a talk and a smoke .
Parsing [sent. 2118 len. 30]: I spoke of the previous conversation and said there was something very pathetic about this half century of exile , and that I wished the L200 scheme had succeeded .
Parsing [sent. 2119 len. 4]: `` With him ?
Parsing [sent. 2120 len. 5]: Oh , it did .
Parsing [sent. 2121 len. 8]: It 's not so sad a case .
Parsing [sent. 2122 len. 13]: He is modest , and he left out some of the particulars .
Parsing [sent. 2123 len. 16]: The lad reached South Australia just in time to help discover the Burra-Burra copper mines .
Parsing [sent. 2124 len. 11]: They turned out L700 ,000 in the first three years .
Parsing [sent. 2125 len. 9]: Up to now they have yielded L20 ,000,000 .
Parsing [sent. 2126 len. 6]: He has had his share .
Parsing [sent. 2127 len. 32]: Before that boy had been in the country two years he could have gone home and bought a village ; he could go now and buy a city , I think .
Parsing [sent. 2128 len. 11]: No , there is nothing very pathetic about his case .
Parsing [sent. 2129 len. 15]: He and his copper arrived at just a handy time to save South Australia .
Parsing [sent. 2130 len. 18]: It had got mashed pretty flat under the collapse of a land boom a while before . ''
Parsing [sent. 2131 len. 12]: There it is again ; picturesque history -- Australia 's specialty .
Parsing [sent. 2132 len. 12]: In 1829 South Australia had n't a white man in it .
Parsing [sent. 2133 len. 26]: In 1836 the British Parliament erected it -- still a solitude -- into a Province , and gave it a governor and other governmental machinery .
Parsing [sent. 2134 len. 26]: Speculators took hold , now , and inaugurated a vast land scheme , and invited immigration , encouraging it with lurid promises of sudden wealth .
Parsing [sent. 2135 len. 27]: It was well worked in London ; and bishops , statesmen , and all sorts of people made a rush for the land company 's shares .
Parsing [sent. 2136 len. 27]: Immigrants soon began to pour into the region of Adelaide and select town lots and farms in the sand and the mangrove swamps by the sea .
Parsing [sent. 2137 len. 31]: The crowds continued to come , prices of land rose high , then higher and still higher , everybody was prosperous and happy , the boom swelled into gigantic proportions .
Parsing [sent. 2138 len. 78]: A village of sheet iron huts and clapboard sheds sprang up in the sand , and in these wigwams fashion made display ; richly-dressed ladies played on costly pianos , London swells in evening dress and patent-leather boots were abundant , and this fine society drank champagne , and in other ways conducted itself in this capital of humble sheds as it had been accustomed to do in the aristocratic quarters of the metropolis of the world .
Parsing [sent. 2139 len. 24]: The provincial government put up expensive buildings for its own use , and a palace with gardens for the use of its governor .
Parsing [sent. 2140 len. 11]: The governor had a guard , and maintained a court .
Parsing [sent. 2141 len. 9]: Roads , wharves , and hospitals were built .
Parsing [sent. 2142 len. 26]: All this on credit , on paper , on wind , on inflated and fictitious values -- on the boom 's moonshine , in fact .
Parsing [sent. 2143 len. 10]: This went on handsomely during four or five years .
Parsing [sent. 2144 len. 9]: Then all of a sudden came a smash .
Parsing [sent. 2145 len. 68]: Bills for a huge amount drawn by the governor upon the Treasury were dishonored , land company 's credit went up in smoke , a panic followed , values fell with a rush , the frightened immigrants seized their gripsacks and fled to other lands , leaving behind them a good imitation of a solitude , where lately had been a buzzing and populous hive of men .
Parsing [sent. 2146 len. 13]: Adelaide was indeed almost empty ; its population had fallen to 3,000 .
Parsing [sent. 2147 len. 9]: During two years or more the death-trance continued .
Parsing [sent. 2148 len. 12]: Prospect of revival there was none ; hope of it ceased .
Parsing [sent. 2149 len. 16]: Then , as suddenly as the paralysis had come , came the resurrection from it .
Parsing [sent. 2150 len. 16]: Those astonishingly rich copper mines were discovered , and the corpse got up and danced .
Parsing [sent. 2151 len. 61]: The wool production began to grow ; grain-raising followed -- followed so vigorously , too , that four or five years after the copper discovery , this little colony , which had had to import its breadstuffs formerly , and pay hard prices for them -- once $ 50 a barrel for flour -- had become an exporter of grain .
Parsing [sent. 2152 len. 4]: The prosperities continued .
Parsing [sent. 2153 len. 66]: After many years Providence , desiring to show especial regard for New South Wales and exhibit a loving interest in its welfare which should certify to all nations the recognition of that colony 's conspicuous righteousness and distinguished well-deserving , conferred upon it that treasury of inconceivable riches , Broken Hill ; and South Australia went over the border and took it , giving thanks .
Parsing [sent. 2154 len. 11]: Among our passengers was an American with a unique vocation .
Parsing [sent. 2155 len. 46]: Unique is a strong word , but I use it justifiably if I did not misconceive what the American told me ; for I understood him to say that in the world there was not another man engaged in the business which he was following .
Parsing [sent. 2156 len. 31]: He was buying the kangaroo-skin crop ; buying all of it , both the Australian crop and the Tasmanian ; and buying it for an American house in New York .
Parsing [sent. 2157 len. 25]: The prices were not high , as there was no competition , but the year 's aggregate of skins would cost him L30 ,000 .
Parsing [sent. 2158 len. 21]: I had had the idea that the kangaroo was about extinct in Tasmania and well thinned out on the continent .
Parsing [sent. 2159 len. 11]: In America the skins are tanned and made into shoes .
Parsing [sent. 2160 len. 33]: After the tanning , the leather takes a new name -- which I have forgotten -- I only remember that the new name does not indicate that the kangaroo furnishes the leather .
Parsing [sent. 2161 len. 18]: There was a German competition for a while , some years ago , but that has ceased .
Parsing [sent. 2162 len. 21]: The Germans failed to arrive at the secret of tanning the skins successfully , and they withdrew from the business .
Parsing [sent. 2163 len. 24]: Now then , I suppose that I have seen a man whose occupation is really entitled to bear that high epithet -- unique .
Parsing [sent. 2164 len. 23]: And I suppose that there is not another occupation in the world that is restricted to the hands of a sole person .
Parsing [sent. 2165 len. 9]: I can think of no instance of it .
Parsing [sent. 2166 len. 38]: There is more than one Pope , there is more than one Emperor , there is even more than one living god , walking upon the earth and worshiped in all sincerity by large populations of men .
Parsing [sent. 2167 len. 24]: I have seen and talked with two of these Beings myself in India , and I have the autograph of one of them .
Parsing [sent. 2168 len. 22]: It can come good , by and by , I reckon , if I attach it to a `` permit . ''
Parsing [sent. 2169 len. 31]: Approaching Adelaide we dismounted from the train , as the French say , and were driven in an open carriage over the hills and along their slopes to the city .
Parsing [sent. 2170 len. 23]: It was an excursion of an hour or two , and the charm of it could not be overstated , I think .
Parsing [sent. 2171 len. 61]: The road wound around gaps and gorges , and offered all varieties of scenery and prospect -- mountains , crags , country homes , gardens , forests -- color , color , color everywhere , and the air fine and fresh , the skies blue , and not a shred of cloud to mar the downpour of the brilliant sunshine .
Parsing [sent. 2172 len. 33]: And finally the mountain gateway opened , and the immense plain lay spread out below and stretching away into dim distances on every hand , soft and delicate and dainty and beautiful .
Parsing [sent. 2173 len. 8]: On its near edge reposed the city .
Parsing [sent. 2174 len. 5]: We descended and entered .
Parsing [sent. 2175 len. 23]: There was nothing to remind one of the humble capital , of huts and sheds of the long-vanished day of the land-boom .
Parsing [sent. 2176 len. 39]: No , this was a modern city , with wide streets , compactly built ; with fine homes everywhere , embowered in foliage and flowers , and with imposing masses of public buildings nobly grouped and architecturally beautiful .
Parsing [sent. 2177 len. 14]: There was prosperity , in the air ; for another boom was on .
Parsing [sent. 2178 len. 74]: Providence , desiring to show especial regard for the neighboring colony on the west called Western Australia -- and exhibit a loving interest in its welfare which should certify to all nations the recognition of that colony 's conspicuous righteousness and distinguished well-deserving , had recently conferred upon it that majestic treasury of golden riches , Coolgardie ; and now South Australia had gone around the corner and taken it , giving thanks .
Parsing [sent. 2179 len. 13]: Everything comes to him who is patient and good , and waits .
Parsing [sent. 2180 len. 28]: But South Australia deserves much , for apparently she is a hospitable home for every alien who chooses to come ; and for his religion , too .
Parsing [sent. 2181 len. 44]: She has a population , as per the latest census , of only 320,000-odd , and yet her varieties of religion indicate the presence within her borders of samples of people from pretty nearly every part of the globe you can think of .
Parsing [sent. 2182 len. 11]: Tabulated , these varieties of religion make a remarkable show .
Parsing [sent. 2183 len. 11]: One would have to go far to find its match .

Parsing [sent. 2193 len. 9]: You see how healthy the religious atmosphere is .
Parsing [sent. 2194 len. 6]: Anything can live in it .
Parsing [sent. 2195 len. 18]: Agnostics , Atheists , Freethinkers , Infidels , Mormons , Pagans , Indefinites they are all there .
Parsing [sent. 2196 len. 25]: And all the big sects of the world can do more than merely live in it : they can spread , flourish , prosper .
Parsing [sent. 2197 len. 8]: All except the Spiritualists and the Theosophists .
Parsing [sent. 2198 len. 11]: That is the most curious feature of this curious table .
Parsing [sent. 2199 len. 8]: What is the matter with the specter ?
Parsing [sent. 2200 len. 7]: Why do they puff him away ?

Parsing [sent. 2205 len. 20]: The successor of the sheet-iron hamlet of the mangrove marshes has that other Australian specialty , the Botanical Gardens .
Parsing [sent. 2206 len. 7]: We can not have these paradises .
Parsing [sent. 2207 len. 19]: The best we could do would be to cover a vast acreage under glass and apply steam heat .
Parsing [sent. 2208 len. 53]: But it would be inadequate , the lacks would still be so great : the confined sense , the sense of suffocation , the atmospheric dimness , the sweaty heat -- these would all be there , in place of the Australian openness to the sky , the sunshine and the breeze .
Parsing [sent. 2209 len. 16]: Whatever will grow under glass with us will flourish rampantly out of doors in Australia .
Parsing [sent. 2210 len. 25]: -- -LSB- The greatest heat in Victoria , that there is an authoritative record of , was at Sandhurst , in January , 1862 .
Parsing [sent. 2211 len. 10]: The thermometer then registered 117 degrees in the shade .
Parsing [sent. 2212 len. 21]: In January , 1880 , the heat at Adelaide , South Australia , was 172 degrees in the sun . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 2213 len. 33]: When the white man came the continent was nearly as poor , in variety of vegetation , as the desert of Sahara ; now it has everything that grows on the earth .
Parsing [sent. 2214 len. 51]: In fact , not Australia only , but all Australasia has levied tribute upon the flora of the rest of the world ; and wherever one goes the results appear , in gardens private and public , in the woodsy walls of the highways , and in even the forests .
Parsing [sent. 2215 len. 60]: If you see a curious or beautiful tree or bush or flower , and ask about it , the people , answering , usually name a foreign country as the place of its origin -- India , Africa , Japan , China , England , America , Java , Sumatra , New Guinea , Polynesia , and so on .
Parsing [sent. 2216 len. 23]: In the Zoological Gardens of Adelaide I saw the only laughing jackass that ever showed any disposition to be courteous to me .
Parsing [sent. 2217 len. 29]: This one opened his head wide and laughed like a demon ; or like a maniac who was consumed with humorous scorn over a cheap and degraded pun .
Parsing [sent. 2218 len. 7]: It was a very human laugh .
Parsing [sent. 2219 len. 19]: If he had been out of sight I could have believed that the laughter came from a man .
Parsing [sent. 2220 len. 20]: It is an odd-looking bird , with a head and beak that are much too large for its body .
Parsing [sent. 2221 len. 31]: In time man will exterminate the rest of the wild creatures of Australia , but this one will probably survive , for man is his friend and lets him alone .
Parsing [sent. 2222 len. 21]: Man always has a good reason for his charities towards wild things , human or animal when he has any .
Parsing [sent. 2223 len. 12]: In this case the bird is spared because he kills snakes .
Parsing [sent. 2224 len. 15]: If L. J. will take my advice he will not kill all of them .
Parsing [sent. 2225 len. 14]: In that garden I also saw the wild Australian dog -- the dingo .
Parsing [sent. 2226 len. 29]: He was a beautiful creature -- shapely , graceful , a little wolfish in some of his aspects , but with a most friendly eye and sociable disposition .
Parsing [sent. 2227 len. 22]: The dingo is not an importation ; he was present in great force when the whites first came to the continent .
Parsing [sent. 2228 len. 39]: It may be that he is the oldest dog in the universe ; his origin , his descent , the place where his ancestors first appeared , are as unknown and as untraceable as are the camel 's .
Parsing [sent. 2229 len. 16]: He is the most precious dog in the world , for he does not bark .
Parsing [sent. 2230 len. 22]: But in an evil hour he got to raiding the sheep-runs to appease his hunger , and that sealed his doom .
Parsing [sent. 2231 len. 14]: He is hunted , now , just as if he were a wolf .
Parsing [sent. 2232 len. 15]: He has been sentenced to extermination , and the sentence will be carried out .
Parsing [sent. 2233 len. 9]: This is all right , and not objectionable .
Parsing [sent. 2234 len. 11]: The world was made for man -- the white man .
Parsing [sent. 2235 len. 6]: South Australia is confusingly named .
Parsing [sent. 2236 len. 13]: All of the colonies have a southern exposure except one -- Queensland .
Parsing [sent. 2237 len. 9]: Properly speaking , South Australia is middle Australia .
Parsing [sent. 2238 len. 18]: It extends straight up through the center of the continent like the middle board in a center-table .
Parsing [sent. 2239 len. 18]: It is 2,000 miles high , from south to north , and about a third as wide .
Parsing [sent. 2240 len. 55]: A wee little spot down in its southeastern corner contains eight or nine-tenths of its population ; the other one or two-tenths are elsewhere -- as elsewhere as they could be in the United States with all the country between Denver and Chicago , and Canada and the Gulf of Mexico to scatter over .
Parsing [sent. 2241 len. 6]: There is plenty of room .
Parsing [sent. 2242 len. 28]: A telegraph line stretches straight up north through that 2,000 miles of wilderness and desert from Adelaide to Port Darwin on the edge of the upper ocean .
Parsing [sent. 2243 len. 18]: South Australia built the line ; and did it in 1871-2 when her population numbered only 185,000 .
Parsing [sent. 2244 len. 63]: It was a great work ; for there were no roads , no paths ; 1,300 miles of the route had been traversed but once before by white men ; provisions , wire , and poles had to be carried over immense stretches of desert ; wells had to be dug along the route to supply the men and cattle with water .
Parsing [sent. 2245 len. 26]: A cable had been previously laid from Port Darwin to Java and thence to India , and there was telegraphic communication with England from India .
Parsing [sent. 2246 len. 19]: And so , if Adelaide could make connection with Port Darwin it meant connection with the whole world .
Parsing [sent. 2247 len. 4]: The enterprise succeeded .
Parsing [sent. 2248 len. 22]: One could watch the London markets daily , now ; the profit to the wool-growers of Australia was instant and enormous .
Parsing [sent. 2249 len. 23]: A telegram from Melbourne to San Francisco covers approximately 20,000 miles -- the equivalent of five-sixths of the way around the globe .
Parsing [sent. 2250 len. 23]: It has to halt along the way a good many times and be repeated ; still , but little time is lost .
Parsing [sent. 2251 len. 13]: These halts , and the distances between them , are here tabulated .

Parsing [sent. 2259 len. 16]: If I have at any time called it a Colony , I withdraw the discourtesy .
Parsing [sent. 2260 len. 15]: It is not a Colony , it is a Province ; and officially so .
Parsing [sent. 2261 len. 12]: Moreover , it is the only one so named in Australasia .
Parsing [sent. 2262 len. 22]: There was great enthusiasm ; it was the Province 's national holiday , its Fourth of July , so to speak .
Parsing [sent. 2263 len. 27]: It is the pre-eminent holiday ; and that is saying much , in a country where they seem to have a most un-English mania for holidays .
Parsing [sent. 2264 len. 57]: Mainly they are workingmen 's holidays ; for in South Australia the workingman is sovereign ; his vote is the desire of the politician -- indeed , it is the very breath of the politician 's being ; the parliament exists to deliver the will of the workingman , and the government exists to execute it .
Parsing [sent. 2265 len. 17]: The workingman is a great power everywhere in Australia , but South Australia is his paradise .
Parsing [sent. 2266 len. 16]: He has had a hard time in this world , and has earned a paradise .
Parsing [sent. 2267 len. 8]: I am glad he has found it .
Parsing [sent. 2268 len. 13]: The holidays there are frequent enough to be bewildering to the stranger .
Parsing [sent. 2269 len. 18]: I tried to get the hang of the system , but was not able to do it .
Parsing [sent. 2270 len. 11]: You have seen that the Province is tolerant , religious-wise .
Parsing [sent. 2271 len. 7]: It is so politically , also .
Parsing [sent. 2272 len. 24]: One of the speakers at the Commemoration banquet -- the Minister of Public Works-was an American , born and reared in New England .
Parsing [sent. 2273 len. 20]: There is nothing narrow about the Province , politically , or in any other way that I know of .
Parsing [sent. 2274 len. 8]: Sixty-four religions and a Yankee cabinet minister .
Parsing [sent. 2275 len. 9]: No amount of horse-racing can damn this community .
Parsing [sent. 2276 len. 10]: The mean temperature of the Province is 62 deg .
Parsing [sent. 2277 len. 32]: The death-rate is 13 in the 1,000 -- about half what it is in the city of New York , I should think , and New York is a healthy city .
Parsing [sent. 2278 len. 24]: Thirteen is the death-rate for the average citizen of the Province , but there seems to be no death-rate for the old people .
Parsing [sent. 2279 len. 12]: There were people at the Commemoration banquet who could remember Cromwell .
Parsing [sent. 2280 len. 6]: There were six of them .
Parsing [sent. 2281 len. 18]: These Old Settlers had all been present at the original Reading of the Proclamation , in 1836 .
Parsing [sent. 2282 len. 50]: They showed signs of the blightings and blastings of time , in their outward aspect , but they were young within ; young and cheerful , and ready to talk ; ready to talk , and talk all you wanted ; in their turn , and out of it .
Parsing [sent. 2283 len. 12]: They were down for six speeches , and they made 42 .
Parsing [sent. 2284 len. 19]: The governor and the cabinet and the mayor were down for 42 speeches , and they made 6 .
Parsing [sent. 2285 len. 13]: They have splendid grit , the Old Settlers , splendid staying power .
Parsing [sent. 2286 len. 64]: But they do not hear well , and when they see the mayor going through motions which they recognize as the introducing of a speaker , they think they are the one , and they all get up together , and begin to respond , in the most animated way ; and the more the mayor gesticulates , and shouts `` Sit down !
Parsing [sent. 2287 len. 4]: Sit down ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2288 len. 80]: the more they take it for applause , and the more excited and reminiscent and enthusiastic they get ; and next , when they see the whole house laughing and crying , three of them think it is about the bitter old-time hardships they are describing , and the other three think the laughter is caused by the jokes they have been uncorking -- jokes of the vintage of 1836 -- and then the way they do go on !
Parsing [sent. 2289 len. 41]: And finally when ushers come and plead , and beg , and gently and reverently crowd them down into their seats , they say , `` Oh , I 'm not tired -- I could bang along a week ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2290 len. 34]: and they sit there looking simple and childlike , and gentle , and proud of their oratory , and wholly unconscious of what is going on at the other end of the room .
Parsing [sent. 2291 len. 83]: And so one of the great dignitaries gets a chance , and begins his carefully prepared speech , impressively and with solemnity -- `` When we , now great and prosperous and powerful , bow our heads in reverent wonder in the contemplation of those sublimities of energy , of wisdom , of forethought , of -- '' Up come the immortal six again , in a body , with a joyous `` Hey , I 've thought of another one ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2292 len. 49]: and at it they go , with might and main , hearing not a whisper of the pandemonium that salutes them , but taking all the visible violences for applause , as before , and hammering joyously away till the imploring ushers pray them into their seats again .
Parsing [sent. 2293 len. 45]: And a pity , too ; for those lovely old boys did so enjoy living their heroic youth over , in these days of their honored antiquity ; and certainly the things they had to tell were usually worth the telling and the hearing .
Parsing [sent. 2294 len. 90]: It was a stirring spectacle ; stirring in more ways than one , for it was amazingly funny , and at the same time deeply pathetic ; for they had seen so much , these time-worn veterans , and had suffered so much ; and had built so strongly and well , and laid the foundations of their commonwealth so deep , in liberty and tolerance ; and had lived to see the structure rise to such state and dignity and hear themselves so praised for their honorable work .
Parsing [sent. 2295 len. 20]: One of these old gentlemen told me some things of interest afterward ; things about the aboriginals , mainly .
Parsing [sent. 2296 len. 41]: He thought them intelligent -- remarkably so in some directions -- and he said that along with their unpleasant qualities they had some exceedingly good ones ; and he considered it a great pity that the race had died out .
Parsing [sent. 2297 len. 52]: He instanced their invention of the boomerang and the `` weet-weet '' as evidences of their brightness ; and as another evidence of it he said he had never seen a white man who had cleverness enough to learn to do the miracles with those two toys that the aboriginals achieved .
Parsing [sent. 2298 len. 35]: He said that even the smartest whites had been obliged to confess that they could not learn the trick of the boomerang in perfection ; that it had possibilities which they could not master .
Parsing [sent. 2299 len. 21]: The white man could not control its motions , could not make it obey him ; but the aboriginal could .
Parsing [sent. 2300 len. 26]: He told me some wonderful things -- some almost incredible things -- which he had seen the blacks do with the boomerang and the weet-weet .
Parsing [sent. 2301 len. 16]: They have been confirmed to me since by other early settlers and by trustworthy books .
Parsing [sent. 2302 len. 27]: It is contended -- and may be said to be conceded -- that the boomerang was known to certain savage tribes in Europe in Roman times .
Parsing [sent. 2303 len. 14]: In support of this , Virgil and two other Roman poets are quoted .
Parsing [sent. 2304 len. 13]: It is also contended that it was known to the ancient Egyptians .
Parsing [sent. 2305 len. 39]: One of two things is then apparent : either some one with a boomerang arrived in Australia in the days of antiquity before European knowledge of the thing had been lost , or the Australian aboriginal reinvented it .
Parsing [sent. 2306 len. 17]: It will take some time to find out which of these two propositions is the fact .
Parsing [sent. 2307 len. 6]: But there is no hurry .

Parsing [sent. 2309 len. 37]: It is by the goodness of God that in our country we have those three unspeakably precious things : freedom of speech , freedom of conscience , and the prudence never to practice either of them .

Parsing [sent. 2311 len. 7]: From diary : Mr. G. called .
Parsing [sent. 2312 len. 24]: I had not seen him since Nauheim , Germany -- several years ago ; the time that the cholera broke out at Hamburg .
Parsing [sent. 2313 len. 36]: We talked of the people we had known there , or had casually met ; and G. said : `` Do you remember my introducing you to an earl -- the Earl of C. ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2314 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 2315 len. 9]: That was the last time I saw you .
Parsing [sent. 2316 len. 17]: You and he were in a carriage , just starting -- belated -- for the train .
Parsing [sent. 2317 len. 5]: I remember it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2318 len. 20]: `` I remember it too , because of a thing which happened then which I was not looking for .
Parsing [sent. 2319 len. 46]: He had told me a while before , about a remarkable and interesting Californian whom he had met and who was a friend of yours , and said that if he should ever meet you he would ask you for some particulars about that Californian .
Parsing [sent. 2320 len. 51]: The subject was not mentioned that day at Nauheim , for we were hurrying away , and there was no time ; but the thing that surprised me was this : when I introduced you , you said , ' I am glad to meet your lordship -- again . '
Parsing [sent. 2321 len. 8]: The ` again ' was the surprise .
Parsing [sent. 2322 len. 26]: He is a little hard of hearing , and did n't catch that word , and I thought you had n't intended that he should .
Parsing [sent. 2323 len. 22]: As we drove off I had only time to say , ` Why , what do you know about him ? '
Parsing [sent. 2324 len. 35]: and I understood you to say , ` Oh , nothing , except that he is the quickest judge of -- ' Then we were gone , and I did n't get the rest .
Parsing [sent. 2325 len. 14]: I wondered what it was that he was such a quick judge of .
Parsing [sent. 2326 len. 17]: I have thought of it many times since , and still wondered what it could be .
Parsing [sent. 2327 len. 14]: He and I talked it over , but could not guess it out .
Parsing [sent. 2328 len. 24]: He thought it must be fox-hounds or horses , for he is a good judge of those -- no one is a better .
Parsing [sent. 2329 len. 41]: But you could n't know that , because you did n't know him ; you had mistaken him for some one else ; it must be that , he said , because he knew you had never met him before .
Parsing [sent. 2330 len. 10]: And of course you had n't had you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2331 len. 7]: `` Yes , I had . ''
Parsing [sent. 2332 len. 5]: `` Is that so ?
Parsing [sent. 2333 len. 3]: Where ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2334 len. 9]: `` At a fox-hunt , in England . ''

Parsing [sent. 2336 len. 11]: Why , he had n't the least recollection of it .

Parsing [sent. 2339 len. 12]: `` Well , it left not the least impression upon him .

Parsing [sent. 2341 len. 5]: `` About the fox .
Parsing [sent. 2342 len. 7]: I think that was all . ''
Parsing [sent. 2343 len. 16]: `` Why , that would interest him ; that ought to have left an impression .
Parsing [sent. 2344 len. 7]: What did he talk about ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2345 len. 5]: `` The fox . ''
Parsing [sent. 2346 len. 5]: It 's very curious .
Parsing [sent. 2347 len. 6]: I do n't understand it .
Parsing [sent. 2348 len. 11]: Did what he said leave an impression upon you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2349 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 2350 len. 26]: It showed me that he was a quick judge of -- however , I will tell you all about it , then you will understand .
Parsing [sent. 2351 len. 13]: It was a quarter of a century ago 1873 or ' 74 .
Parsing [sent. 2352 len. 40]: I had an American friend in London named F. , who was fond of hunting , and his friends the Blanks invited him and me to come out to a hunt and be their guests at their country place .
Parsing [sent. 2353 len. 24]: In the morning the mounts were provided , but when I saw the horses I changed my mind and asked permission to walk .
Parsing [sent. 2354 len. 25]: I had never seen an English hunter before , and it seemed to me that I could hunt a fox safer on the ground .
Parsing [sent. 2355 len. 33]: I had always been diffident about horses , anyway , even those of the common altitudes , and I did not feel competent to hunt on a horse that went on stilts .
Parsing [sent. 2356 len. 45]: So then Mrs. Blank came to my help and said I could go with her in the dog-cart and we would drive to a place she knew of , and there we should have a good glimpse of the hunt as it went by .
Parsing [sent. 2357 len. 39]: `` When we got to that place I got out and went and leaned my elbows on a low stone wall which enclosed a turfy and beautiful great field with heavy wood on all its sides except ours .
Parsing [sent. 2358 len. 22]: Mrs. Blank sat in the dog-cart fifty yards away , which was as near as she could get with the vehicle .
Parsing [sent. 2359 len. 14]: I was full of interest , for I had never seen a fox-hunt .
Parsing [sent. 2360 len. 21]: I waited , dreaming and imagining , in the deep stillness and impressive tranquility which reigned in that retired spot .
Parsing [sent. 2361 len. 84]: Presently , from away off in the forest on the left , a mellow bugle-note came floating ; then all of a sudden a multitude of dogs burst out of that forest and went tearing by and disappeared in the forest on the right ; there was a pause , and then a cloud of horsemen in black caps and crimson coats plunged out of the left-hand forest and went flaming across the field like a prairie-fire , a stirring sight to see .
Parsing [sent. 2362 len. 17]: There was one man ahead of the rest , and he came spurring straight at me .
Parsing [sent. 2363 len. 5]: He was fiercely excited .
Parsing [sent. 2364 len. 14]: It was fine to see him ride ; he was a master horseman .
Parsing [sent. 2365 len. 53]: He came like a storm till he was within seven feet of me , where I was leaning on the wall , then he stood his horse straight up in the air on his hind toe-nails , and shouted like a demon : '' ` Which way 'd the fox go ? '
Parsing [sent. 2366 len. 24]: `` I did n't much like the tone , but I did not let on ; for he was excited , you know .
Parsing [sent. 2367 len. 20]: But I was calm ; so I said softly , and without acrimony : '' ` Which fox ? '
Parsing [sent. 2368 len. 7]: `` It seemed to anger him .
Parsing [sent. 2369 len. 16]: I do n't know why ; and he thundered out : '' ` WHICH fox ?
Parsing [sent. 2370 len. 5]: Why , THE fox ?
Parsing [sent. 2371 len. 8]: Which way did the FOX go ? '
Parsing [sent. 2372 len. 82]: `` I said , with great gentleness -- even argumentatively : '' ` If you could be a little more definite -- a little less vague -- because I am a stranger , and there are many foxes , as you will know even better than I , and unless I know which one it is that you desire to identify , and -- ' '' ` You 're certainly the damdest idiot that has escaped in a thousand years ! '
Parsing [sent. 2373 len. 23]: and he snatched his great horse around as easily as I would snatch a cat , and was away like a hurricane .
Parsing [sent. 2374 len. 5]: A very excitable man .
Parsing [sent. 2375 len. 20]: `` I went back to Mrs. Blank , and she was excited , too -- oh , all alive .
Parsing [sent. 2376 len. 10]: She said : '' ` He spoke to you !
Parsing [sent. 2377 len. 7]: -- did n't he ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 2378 len. 11]: ` Yes , it is what happened . ' '' '
Parsing [sent. 2379 len. 4]: I knew it !
Parsing [sent. 2380 len. 16]: I could n't hear what he said , but I knew he spoke to you !
Parsing [sent. 2381 len. 7]: Do you know who it was ?
Parsing [sent. 2382 len. 13]: It was Lord C. , and he is Master of the Buckhounds !
Parsing [sent. 2383 len. 12]: Tell me -- what do you think of him ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 2384 len. 3]: ` Him ?
Parsing [sent. 2385 len. 24]: Well , for sizing-up a stranger , he 's got the most sudden and accurate judgment of any man I ever saw . '
Parsing [sent. 2386 len. 5]: `` It pleased her .
Parsing [sent. 2387 len. 6]: I thought it would . ''
Parsing [sent. 2388 len. 32]: G. got away from Nauheim just in time to escape being shut in by the quarantine-bars on the frontiers ; and so did we , for we left the next day .
Parsing [sent. 2389 len. 31]: But G. had a great deal of trouble in getting by the Italian custom-house , and we should have fared likewise but for the thoughtfulness of our consul-general in Frankfort .
Parsing [sent. 2390 len. 23]: He introduced me to the Italian consul-general , and I brought away from that consulate a letter which made our way smooth .
Parsing [sent. 2391 len. 33]: It was a dozen lines merely commending me in a general way to the courtesies of servants in his Italian Majesty 's service , but it was more powerful than it looked .
Parsing [sent. 2392 len. 40]: In addition to a raft of ordinary baggage , we had six or eight trunks which were filled exclusively with dutiable stuff -- household goods purchased in Frankfort for use in Florence , where we had taken a house .
Parsing [sent. 2393 len. 35]: I was going to ship these through by express ; but at the last moment an order went throughout Germany forbidding the moving of any parcels by train unless the owner went with them .
Parsing [sent. 2394 len. 6]: This was a bad outlook .
Parsing [sent. 2395 len. 28]: We must take these things along , and the delay sure to be caused by the examination of them in the custom-house might lose us our train .
Parsing [sent. 2396 len. 18]: I imagined all sorts of terrors , and enlarged them steadily as we approached the Italian frontier .
Parsing [sent. 2397 len. 28]: We were six in number , clogged with all that baggage , and I was courier for the party -- the most incapable one they ever employed .
Parsing [sent. 2398 len. 42]: We arrived , and pressed with the crowd into the immense custom-house , and the usual worries began ; everybody crowding to the counter and begging to have his baggage examined first , and all hands clattering and chattering at once .
Parsing [sent. 2399 len. 27]: It seemed to me that I could do nothing ; it would be better to give it all up and go away and leave the baggage .
Parsing [sent. 2400 len. 13]: I could n't speak the language ; I should never accomplish anything .
Parsing [sent. 2401 len. 30]: Just then a tall handsome man in a fine uniform was passing by and I knew he must be the station-master -- and that reminded me of my letter .
Parsing [sent. 2402 len. 11]: I ran to him and put it into his hands .
Parsing [sent. 2403 len. 48]: He took it out of the envelope , and the moment his eye caught the royal coat of arms printed at its top , he took off his cap and made a beautiful bow to me , and said in English : `` Which is your baggage ?
Parsing [sent. 2404 len. 7]: Please show it to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2405 len. 6]: I showed him the mountain .
Parsing [sent. 2406 len. 38]: Nobody was disturbing it ; nobody was interested in it ; all the family 's attempts to get attention to it had failed -- except in the case of one of the trunks containing the dutiable goods .
Parsing [sent. 2407 len. 6]: It was just being opened .
Parsing [sent. 2408 len. 11]: My officer said : `` There , let that alone !
Parsing [sent. 2409 len. 3]: Lock it .
Parsing [sent. 2410 len. 4]: Now chalk it .
Parsing [sent. 2411 len. 6]: Chalk all of the lot .
Parsing [sent. 2412 len. 10]: Now please come and show me the hand-baggage . ''
Parsing [sent. 2413 len. 30]: He plowed through the waiting crowd , I following , to the counter , and he gave orders again , in his emphatic military way : `` Chalk these .
Parsing [sent. 2414 len. 6]: Chalk all of them . ''
Parsing [sent. 2415 len. 18]: Then he took off his cap and made that beautiful bow again , and went his way .
Parsing [sent. 2416 len. 61]: By this time these attentions had attracted the wonder of that acre of passengers , and the whisper had gone around that the royal family were present getting their baggage chalked ; and as we passed down in review on our way to the door , I was conscious of a pervading atmosphere of envy which gave me deep satisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 2417 len. 7]: But soon there was an accident .
Parsing [sent. 2418 len. 37]: My overcoat pockets were stuffed with German cigars and linen packages of American smoking tobacco , and a porter was following us around with this overcoat on his arm , and gradually getting it upside down .
Parsing [sent. 2419 len. 31]: Just as I , in the rear of my family , moved by the sentinels at the door , about three hatfuls of the tobacco tumbled out on the floor .
Parsing [sent. 2420 len. 85]: One of the soldiers pounced upon it , gathered it up in his arms , pointed back whence I had come , and marched me ahead of him past that long wall of passengers again -- he chattering and exulting like a devil , they smiling in peaceful joy , and I trying to look as if my pride was not hurt , and as if I did not mind being brought to shame before these pleased people who had so lately envied me .
Parsing [sent. 2421 len. 8]: But at heart I was cruelly humbled .
Parsing [sent. 2422 len. 62]: When I had been marched two-thirds of the long distance and the misery of it was at the worst , the stately station-master stepped out from somewhere , and the soldier left me and darted after him and overtook him ; and I could see by the soldier 's excited gestures that he was betraying to him the whole shabby business .
Parsing [sent. 2423 len. 7]: The station-master was plainly very angry .
Parsing [sent. 2424 len. 45]: He came striding down toward me , and when he was come near he began to pour out a stream of indignant Italian ; then suddenly took off his hat and made that beautiful bow and said : `` Oh , it is you !
Parsing [sent. 2425 len. 6]: I beg a thousands pardons !
Parsing [sent. 2426 len. 57]: This idiot here -- '' He turned to the exulting soldier and burst out with a flood of white-hot Italian lava , and the next moment he was bowing , and the soldier and I were moving in procession again -- he in the lead and ashamed , this time , I with my chin up .
Parsing [sent. 2427 len. 24]: And so we marched by the crowd of fascinated passengers , and I went forth to the train with the honors of war .
Parsing [sent. 2428 len. 4]: Tobacco and all .
Parsing [sent. 2429 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXI .
Parsing [sent. 2430 len. 20]: Man will do many things to get himself loved , he will do all things to get himself envied .
Parsing [sent. 2431 len. 9]: -- Pudd ` nhead Wilson 's New Calendar .
Parsing [sent. 2432 len. 16]: Before I saw Australia I had never heard of the `` weet-weet '' at all .
Parsing [sent. 2433 len. 24]: I met but few men who had seen it thrown -- at least I met but few who mentioned having seen it thrown .
Parsing [sent. 2434 len. 18]: Roughly described , it is a fat wooden cigar with its butt-end fastened to a flexible twig .
Parsing [sent. 2435 len. 18]: The whole thing is only a couple of feet long , and weighs less than two ounces .
Parsing [sent. 2436 len. 70]: This feather -- so to call it -- is not thrown through the air , but is flung with an underhanded throw and made to strike the ground a little way in front of the thrower ; then it glances and makes a long skip ; glances again , skips again , and again and again , like the flat stone which a boy sends skating over the water .
Parsing [sent. 2437 len. 48]: The water is smooth , and the stone has a good chance ; so a strong man may make it travel fifty or seventy-five yards ; but the weet-weet has no such good chance , for it strikes sand , grass , and earth in its course .
Parsing [sent. 2438 len. 17]: Yet an expert aboriginal has sent it a measured distance of two hundred and twenty yards .
Parsing [sent. 2439 len. 22]: It would have gone even further but it encountered rank ferns and underwood on its passage and they damaged its speed .
Parsing [sent. 2440 len. 45]: Two hundred and twenty yards ; and so weightless a toy -- a mouse on the end of a bit of wire , in effect ; and not sailing through the accommodating air , but encountering grass and sand and stuff at every jump .
Parsing [sent. 2441 len. 39]: It looks wholly impossible ; but Mr. Brough Smyth saw the feat and did the measuring , and set down the facts in his book about aboriginal life , which he wrote by command of the Victorian Government .
Parsing [sent. 2442 len. 8]: What is the secret of the feat ?
Parsing [sent. 2443 len. 4]: No one explains .
Parsing [sent. 2444 len. 18]: It can not be physical strength , for that could not drive such a feather-weight any distance .
Parsing [sent. 2445 len. 5]: It must be art .
Parsing [sent. 2446 len. 42]: But no one explains what the art of it is ; nor how it gets around that law of nature which says you shall not throw any two-ounce thing 220 yards , either through the air or bumping along the ground .
Parsing [sent. 2447 len. 22]: Rev. J. G. Woods says : `` The distance to which the weet-weet or kangaroo-rat can be thrown is truly astonishing .
Parsing [sent. 2448 len. 22]: I have seen an Australian stand at one side of Kennington Oval and throw the kangaroo rat completely across it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2449 len. 9]: -LRB- Width of Kennington Oval not stated . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 2450 len. 34]: `` It darts through the air with the sharp and menacing hiss of a rifle-ball , its greatest height from the ground being some seven or eight feet . . . . . .
Parsing [sent. 2451 len. 18]: When properly thrown it looks just like a living animal leaping along . . . . . .
Parsing [sent. 2452 len. 26]: Its movements have a wonderful resemblance to the long leaps of a kangaroo-rat fleeing in alarm , with its long tail trailing behind it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2453 len. 34]: The Old Settler said that he had seen distances made by the weet-weet , in the early days , which almost convinced him that it was as extraordinary an instrument as the boomerang .
Parsing [sent. 2454 len. 29]: There must have been a large distribution of acuteness among those naked skinny aboriginals , or they could n't have been such unapproachable trackers and boomerangers and weet-weeters .
Parsing [sent. 2455 len. 34]: It must have been race-aversion that put upon them a good deal of the low-rate intellectual reputation which they bear and have borne this long time in the world 's estimate of them .
Parsing [sent. 2456 len. 7]: They were lazy -- always lazy .
Parsing [sent. 2457 len. 6]: Perhaps that was their trouble .
Parsing [sent. 2458 len. 6]: It is a killing defect .
Parsing [sent. 2459 len. 16]: Surely they could have invented and built a competent house , but they did n't .
Parsing [sent. 2460 len. 16]: And they could have invented and developed the agricultural arts , but they did n't .
Parsing [sent. 2461 len. 29]: They went naked and houseless , and lived on fish and grubs and worms and wild fruits , and were just plain savages , for all their smartness .
Parsing [sent. 2462 len. 61]: With a country as big as the United States to live and multiply in , and with no epidemic diseases among them till the white man came with those and his other appliances of civilization , it is quite probable that there was never a day in his history when he could muster 100,000 of his race in all Australia .
Parsing [sent. 2463 len. 19]: He diligently and deliberately kept population down by infanticide -- largely ; but mainly by certain other methods .
Parsing [sent. 2464 len. 16]: He did not need to practise these artificialities any more after the white man came .
Parsing [sent. 2465 len. 16]: The white man knew ways of keeping down population which were worth several of his .
Parsing [sent. 2466 len. 13]: The white man knew ways of reducing a native population 80 percent .
Parsing [sent. 2467 len. 4]: in 20 years .
Parsing [sent. 2468 len. 12]: The native had never seen anything as fine as that before .
Parsing [sent. 2469 len. 30]: For example , there is the case of the country now called Victoria -- a country eighty times as large as Rhode Island , as I have already said .
Parsing [sent. 2470 len. 24]: By the best official guess there were 4,500 aboriginals in it when the whites came along in the middle of the ` Thirties .
Parsing [sent. 2471 len. 50]: Of these , 1,000 lived in Gippsland , a patch of territory the size of fifteen or sixteen Rhode Islands : they did not diminish as fast as some of the other communities ; indeed , at the end of forty years there were still 200 of them left .
Parsing [sent. 2472 len. 31]: The Geelong tribe diminished more satisfactorily : from 173 persons it faded to 34 in twenty years ; at the end of another twenty the tribe numbered one person altogether .
Parsing [sent. 2473 len. 27]: The two Melbourne tribes could muster almost 300 when the white man came ; they could muster but twenty , thirty-seven years later , in 1875 .
Parsing [sent. 2474 len. 32]: In that year there were still odds and ends of tribes scattered about the colony of Victoria , but I was told that natives of full blood are very scarce now .
Parsing [sent. 2475 len. 17]: It is said that the aboriginals continue in some force in the huge territory called Queensland .
Parsing [sent. 2476 len. 9]: The early whites were not used to savages .
Parsing [sent. 2477 len. 53]: They could not understand the primary law of savage life : that if a man do you a wrong , his whole tribe is responsible -- each individual of it -- and you may take your change out of any individual of it , without bothering to seek out the guilty one .
Parsing [sent. 2478 len. 23]: When a white killed an aboriginal , the tribe applied the ancient law , and killed the first white they came across .
Parsing [sent. 2479 len. 9]: To the whites this was a monstrous thing .
Parsing [sent. 2480 len. 13]: Extermination seemed to be the proper medicine for such creatures as this .
Parsing [sent. 2481 len. 22]: They did not kill all the blacks , but they promptly killed enough of them to make their own persons safe .
Parsing [sent. 2482 len. 19]: From the dawn of civilization down to this day the white man has always used that very precaution .
Parsing [sent. 2483 len. 45]: Mrs. Campbell Praed lived in Queensland , as a child , in the early days , and in her `` Sketches of Australian life , '' we get informing pictures of the early struggles of the white and the black to reform each other .
Parsing [sent. 2484 len. 49]: Speaking of pioneer days in the mighty wilderness of Queensland , Mrs. Praed says : `` At first the natives retreated before the whites ; and , except that they every now and then speared a beast in one of the herds , gave little cause for uneasiness .
Parsing [sent. 2485 len. 62]: But , as the number of squatters increased , each one taking up miles of country and bringing two or three men in his train , so that shepherds ' huts and stockmen 's camps lay far apart , and defenseless in the midst of hostile tribes , the Blacks ' depredations became more frequent and murder was no unusual event .
Parsing [sent. 2486 len. 14]: `` The loneliness of the Australian bush can hardly be painted in words .
Parsing [sent. 2487 len. 88]: Here extends mile after mile of primeval forest where perhaps foot of white man has never trod -- interminable vistas where the eucalyptus trees rear their lofty trunks and spread forth their lanky limbs , from which the red gum oozes and hangs in fantastic pendants like crimson stalactites ; ravines along the sides of which the long-bladed grass grows rankly ; level untimbered plains alternating with undulating tracts of pasture , here and there broken by a stony ridge , steep gully , or dried-up creek .
Parsing [sent. 2488 len. 45]: All wild , vast and desolate ; all the same monotonous gray coloring , except where the wattle , when in blossom , shows patches of feathery gold , or a belt of scrub lies green , glossy , and impenetrable as Indian jungle .
Parsing [sent. 2489 len. 64]: `` The solitude seems intensified by the strange sounds of reptiles , birds , and insects , and by the absence of larger creatures ; of which in the day-time , the only audible signs are the stampede of a herd of kangaroo , or the rustle of a wallabi , or a dingo stirring the grass as it creeps to its lair .
Parsing [sent. 2490 len. 42]: But there are the whirring of locusts , the demoniac chuckle of the laughing jack-ass , the screeching of cockatoos and parrots , the hissing of the frilled lizard , and the buzzing of innumerable insects hidden under the dense undergrowth .
Parsing [sent. 2491 len. 35]: And then at night , the melancholy wailing of the curlews , the dismal howling of dingoes , the discordant croaking of tree-frogs , might well shake the nerves of the solitary watcher . ''
Parsing [sent. 2492 len. 8]: That is the theater for the drama .
Parsing [sent. 2493 len. 27]: When you comprehend one or two other details , you will perceive how well suited for trouble it was , and how loudly it invited it .
Parsing [sent. 2494 len. 23]: The cattlemen 's stations were scattered over that profound wilderness miles and miles apart -- at each station half a dozen persons .
Parsing [sent. 2495 len. 16]: There was a plenty of cattle , the black natives were always ill-nourished and hungry .
Parsing [sent. 2496 len. 6]: The land belonged to them .
Parsing [sent. 2497 len. 47]: The whites had not bought it , and could n't buy it ; for the tribes had no chiefs , nobody in authority , nobody competent to sell and convey ; and the tribes themselves had no comprehension of the idea of transferable ownership of land .
Parsing [sent. 2498 len. 20]: The ousted owners were despised by the white interlopers , and this opinion was not hidden under a bushel .
Parsing [sent. 2499 len. 12]: More promising materials for a tragedy could not have been collated .
Parsing [sent. 2500 len. 39]: Let Mrs. Praed speak : `` At Nie Nie station , one dark night , the unsuspecting hut-keeper , having , as he believed , secured himself against assault , was lying wrapped in his blankets sleeping profoundly .
Parsing [sent. 2501 len. 17]: The Blacks crept stealthily down the chimney and battered in his skull while he slept . ''
Parsing [sent. 2502 len. 11]: One could guess the whole drama from that little text .
Parsing [sent. 2503 len. 5]: The curtain was up .
Parsing [sent. 2504 len. 27]: It would not fall until the mastership of one party or the other was determined -- and permanently : `` There was treachery on both sides .
Parsing [sent. 2505 len. 32]: The Blacks killed the Whites when they found them defenseless , and the Whites slew the Blacks in a wholesale and promiscuous fashion which offended against my childish sense of justice .
Parsing [sent. 2506 len. 21]: `` They were regarded as little above the level of brutes , and in some cases were destroyed like vermin .
Parsing [sent. 2507 len. 6]: `` Here is an instance .
Parsing [sent. 2508 len. 31]: A squatter , whose station was surrounded by Blacks , whom he suspected to be hostile and from whom he feared an attack , parleyed with them from his house-door .
Parsing [sent. 2509 len. 64]: He told them it was Christmas-time -- a time at which all men , black or white , feasted ; that there were flour , sugar-plums , good things in plenty in the store , and that he would make for them such a pudding as they had never dreamed of -- a great pudding of which all might eat and be filled .
Parsing [sent. 2510 len. 7]: The Blacks listened and were lost .
Parsing [sent. 2511 len. 7]: The pudding was made and distributed .
Parsing [sent. 2512 len. 20]: Next morning there was howling in the camp , for it had been sweetened with sugar and arsenic ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2513 len. 14]: The white man 's spirit was right , but his method was wrong .
Parsing [sent. 2514 len. 27]: His spirit was the spirit which the civilized white has always exhibited toward the savage , but the use of poison was a departure from custom .
Parsing [sent. 2515 len. 30]: True , it was merely a technical departure , not a real one ; still , it was a departure , and therefore a mistake , in my opinion .
Parsing [sent. 2516 len. 33]: It was better , kinder , swifter , and much more humane than a number of the methods which have been sanctified by custom , but that does not justify its employment .
Parsing [sent. 2517 len. 10]: That is , it does not wholly justify it .
Parsing [sent. 2518 len. 20]: Its unusual nature makes it stand out and attract an amount of attention which it is not entitled to .
Parsing [sent. 2519 len. 54]: It takes hold upon morbid imaginations and they work it up into a sort of exhibition of cruelty , and this smirches the good name of our civilization , whereas one of the old harsher methods would have had no such effect because usage has made those methods familiar to us and innocent .
Parsing [sent. 2520 len. 41]: In many countries we have chained the savage and starved him to death ; and this we do not care for , because custom has inured us to it ; yet a quick death by poison is lovingkindness to it .
Parsing [sent. 2521 len. 37]: In many countries we have burned the savage at the stake ; and this we do not care for , because custom has inured us to it ; yet a quick death is loving-kindness to it .
Parsing [sent. 2522 len. 80]: In more than one country we have hunted the savage and his little children and their mother with dogs and guns through the woods and swamps for an afternoon 's sport , and filled the region with happy laughter over their sprawling and stumbling flight , and their wild supplications for mercy ; but this method we do not mind , because custom has inured us to it ; yet a quick death by poison is lovingkindness to it .
Parsing [sent. 2523 len. 74]: In many countries we have taken the savage 's land from him , and made him our slave , and lashed him every day , and broken his pride , and made death his only friend , and overworked him till he dropped in his tracks ; and this we do not care for , because custom has inured us to it ; yet a quick death by poison is lovingkindness to it .
Parsing [sent. 2524 len. 62]: In the Matabeleland today -- why , there we are confining ourselves to sanctified custom , we Rhodes-Beit millionaires in South Africa and Dukes in London ; and nobody cares , because we are used to the old holy customs , and all we ask is that no notice-inviting new ones shall be intruded upon the attention of our comfortable consciences .
Parsing [sent. 2525 len. 24]: Mrs. Praed says of the poisoner , `` That squatter deserves to have his name handed down to the contempt of posterity . ''
Parsing [sent. 2526 len. 9]: I am sorry to hear her say that .
Parsing [sent. 2527 len. 16]: I myself blame him for one thing , and severely , but I stop there .
Parsing [sent. 2528 len. 21]: I blame him for , the indiscretion of introducing a novelty which was calculated to attract attention to our civilization .
Parsing [sent. 2529 len. 8]: There was no occasion to do that .
Parsing [sent. 2530 len. 36]: It was his duty , and it is every loyal man 's duty to protect that heritage in every way he can ; and the best way to do that is to attract attention elsewhere .
Parsing [sent. 2531 len. 17]: The squatter 's judgment was bad -- that is plain ; but his heart was right .
Parsing [sent. 2532 len. 41]: He is almost the only pioneering representative of civilization in history who has risen above the prejudices of his caste and his heredity and tried to introduce the element of mercy into the superior race 's dealings with the savage .
Parsing [sent. 2533 len. 25]: His name is lost , and it is a pity ; for it deserves to be handed down to posterity with homage and reverence .
Parsing [sent. 2534 len. 34]: This paragraph is from a London journal : `` To learn what France is doing to spread the blessings of civilization in her distant dependencies we may turn with advantage to New Caledonia .
Parsing [sent. 2535 len. 48]: With a view to attracting free settlers to that penal colony , M. Feillet , the Governor , forcibly expropriated the Kanaka cultivators from the best of their plantations , with a derisory compensation , in spite of the protests of the Council General of the island .
Parsing [sent. 2536 len. 58]: Such immigrants as could be induced to cross the seas thus found themselves in possession of thousands of coffee , cocoa , banana , and bread-fruit trees , the raising of which had cost the wretched natives years of toil whilst the latter had a few five-franc pieces to spend in the liquor stores of Noumea . ''
Parsing [sent. 2537 len. 5]: You observe the combination ?
Parsing [sent. 2538 len. 21]: It is robbery , humiliation , and slow , slow murder , through poverty and the white man 's whisky .
Parsing [sent. 2539 len. 37]: The savage 's gentle friend , the savage 's noble friend , the only magnanimous and unselfish friend the savage has ever had , was not there with the merciful swift release of his poisoned pudding .
Parsing [sent. 2540 len. 26]: There are many humorous things in the world ; among them the white man 's notion that he is less savage than the other savages .

Parsing [sent. 2542 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXII .
Parsing [sent. 2543 len. 17]: Nothing is so ignorant as a man 's left hand , except a lady 's watch .
Parsing [sent. 2544 len. 9]: -- Pudd ` nhead Wilson 's New Calendar .
Parsing [sent. 2545 len. 9]: You notice that Mrs. Praed knows her art .
Parsing [sent. 2546 len. 14]: She can place a thing before you so that you can see it .
Parsing [sent. 2547 len. 7]: She is not alone in that .
Parsing [sent. 2548 len. 21]: Australia is fertile in writers whose books are faithful mirrors of the life of the country and of its history .
Parsing [sent. 2549 len. 45]: The materials were surprisingly rich , both in quality and in mass , and Marcus Clarke , Rolph Boldrewood , Gordon , Kendall , and the others , have built out of them a brilliant and vigorous literature , and one which must endure .
Parsing [sent. 2550 len. 9]: Materials -- there is no end to them !
Parsing [sent. 2551 len. 36]: Why , a literature might be made out of the aboriginal all by himself , his character and ways are so freckled with varieties -- varieties not staled by familiarity , but new to us .
Parsing [sent. 2552 len. 34]: You do not need to invent any picturesquenesses ; whatever you want in that line he can furnish you ; and they will not be fancies and doubtful , but realities and authentic .
Parsing [sent. 2553 len. 26]: In his history , as preserved by the white man 's official records , he is everything -- everything that a human creature can be .
Parsing [sent. 2554 len. 6]: He covers the entire ground .
Parsing [sent. 2555 len. 14]: He is a coward -- there are a thousand fact to prove it .
Parsing [sent. 2556 len. 13]: He is brave -- there are a thousand facts to prove it .
Parsing [sent. 2557 len. 9]: He is treacherous -- oh , beyond imagination !
Parsing [sent. 2558 len. 32]: he is faithful , loyal , true -- the white man 's records supply you with a harvest of instances of it that are noble , worshipful , and pathetically beautiful .
Parsing [sent. 2559 len. 18]: He kills the starving stranger who comes begging for food and shelter there is proof of it .
Parsing [sent. 2560 len. 29]: He succors , and feeds , and guides to safety , to-day , the lost stranger who fired on him only yesterday -- there is proof of it .
Parsing [sent. 2561 len. 29]: He takes his reluctant bride by force , he courts her with a club , then loves her faithfully through a long life -- it is of record .
Parsing [sent. 2562 len. 41]: He gathers to himself another wife by the same processes , beats and bangs her as a daily diversion , and by and by lays down his life in defending her from some outside harm -- it is of record .
Parsing [sent. 2563 len. 29]: He will face a hundred hostiles to rescue one of his children , and will kill another of his children because the family is large enough without it .
Parsing [sent. 2564 len. 40]: His delicate stomach turns , at certain details of the white man 's food ; but he likes over-ripe fish , and brazed dog , and cat , and rat , and will eat his own uncle with relish .
Parsing [sent. 2565 len. 21]: He is a sociable animal , yet he turns aside and hides behind his shield when his mother-in-law goes by .
Parsing [sent. 2566 len. 29]: He is childishly afraid of ghosts and other trivialities that menace his soul , but dread of physical pain is a weakness which he is not acquainted with .
Parsing [sent. 2567 len. 146]: He knows all the great and many of the little constellations , and has names for them ; he has a symbol-writing by means of which he can convey messages far and wide among the tribes ; he has a correct eye for form and expression , and draws a good picture ; he can track a fugitive by delicate traces which the white man 's eye can not discern , and by methods which the finest white intelligence can not master ; he makes a missile which science itself can not duplicate without the model -- if with it ; a missile whose secret baffled and defeated the searchings and theorizings of the white mathematicians for seventy years ; and by an art all his own he performs miracles with it which the white man can not approach untaught , nor parallel after teaching .
Parsing [sent. 2568 len. 48]: Within certain limits this savage 's intellect is the alertest and the brightest known to history or tradition ; and yet the poor creature was never able to invent a counting system that would reach above five , nor a vessel that he could boil water in .
Parsing [sent. 2569 len. 9]: He is the prize-curiosity of all the races .
Parsing [sent. 2570 len. 23]: To all intents and purposes he is dead -- in the body ; but he has features that will live in literature .
Parsing [sent. 2571 len. 40]: Mr. Philip Chauncy , an officer of the Victorian Government , contributed to its archives a report of his personal observations of the aboriginals which has in it some things which I wish to condense slightly and insert here .
Parsing [sent. 2572 len. 45]: He speaks of the quickness of their eyes and the accuracy of their judgment of the direction of approaching missiles as being quite extraordinary , and of the answering suppleness and accuracy of limb and muscle in avoiding the missile as being extraordinary also .
Parsing [sent. 2573 len. 40]: He has seen an aboriginal stand as a target for cricket-balls thrown with great force ten or fifteen yards , by professional bowlers , and successfully dodge them or parry them with his shield during about half an hour .
Parsing [sent. 2574 len. 34]: One of those balls , properly placed , could have killed him ; `` Yet he depended , with the utmost self-possession , on the quickness of his eye and his agility . ''
Parsing [sent. 2575 len. 22]: The shield was the customary war-shield of his race , and would not be a protection to you or to me .
Parsing [sent. 2576 len. 19]: It is no broader than a stovepipe , and is about as long as a man 's arm .
Parsing [sent. 2577 len. 19]: The opposing surface is not flat , but slopes away from the centerline like a boat 's bow .
Parsing [sent. 2578 len. 47]: The difficulty about a cricket-ball that has been thrown with a scientific `` twist '' is , that it suddenly changes its course when it is close to its target and comes straight for the mark when apparently it was going overhead or to one side .
Parsing [sent. 2579 len. 17]: I should not be able to protect myself from such balls for half-an-hour , or less .
Parsing [sent. 2580 len. 16]: Mr. Chauncy once saw `` a little native man '' throw a cricket-ball 119 yards .
Parsing [sent. 2581 len. 13]: This is said to beat the English professional record by thirteen yards .
Parsing [sent. 2582 len. 25]: We have all seen the circus-man bound into the air from a spring-board and make a somersault over eight horses standing side by side .
Parsing [sent. 2583 len. 22]: Mr. Chauncy saw an aboriginal do it over eleven ; and was assured that he had sometimes done it over fourteen .
Parsing [sent. 2584 len. 64]: But what is that to this : `` I saw the same man leap from the ground , and in going over he dipped his head , unaided by his hands , into a hat placed in an inverted position on the top of the head of another man sitting upright on horseback -- both man and horse being of the average size .
Parsing [sent. 2585 len. 18]: The native landed on the other side of the horse with the hat fairly on his head .
Parsing [sent. 2586 len. 40]: The prodigious height of the leap , and the precision with which it was taken so as to enable him to dip his head into the hat , exceeded any feat of the kind I have ever beheld . ''
Parsing [sent. 2587 len. 5]: I should think so !
Parsing [sent. 2588 len. 54]: On board a ship lately I saw a young Oxford athlete run four steps and spring into the air and squirm his hips by a side-twist over a bar that was five and one-half feet high ; but he could not have stood still and cleared a bar that was four feet high .
Parsing [sent. 2589 len. 10]: I know this , because I tried it myself .
Parsing [sent. 2590 len. 11]: One can see now where the kangaroo learned its art .
Parsing [sent. 2591 len. 50]: Sir George Grey and Mr. Eyre testify that the natives dug wells fourteen or fifteen feet deep and two feet in diameter at the bore -- dug them in the sand -- wells that were `` quite circular , carried straight down , and the work beautifully executed . ''
Parsing [sent. 2592 len. 8]: Their tools were their hands and feet .
Parsing [sent. 2593 len. 11]: How did they throw sand out from such a depth ?
Parsing [sent. 2594 len. 19]: How could they stoop down and get it , with only two feet of space to stoop in ?
Parsing [sent. 2595 len. 12]: How did they keep that sand-pipe from caving in on them ?
Parsing [sent. 2596 len. 5]: I do not know .
Parsing [sent. 2597 len. 9]: Still , they did manage those seeming impossibilities .
Parsing [sent. 2598 len. 7]: Swallowed the sand , may be .
Parsing [sent. 2599 len. 125]: Mr. Chauncy speaks highly of the patience and skill and alert intelligence of the native huntsman when he is stalking the emu , the kangaroo , and other game : `` As he walks through the bush his step is light , elastic , and noiseless ; every track on the earth catches his keen eye ; a leaf , or fragment of a stick turned , or a blade of grass recently bent by the tread of one of the lower animals , instantly arrests his attention ; in fact , nothing escapes his quick and powerful sight on the ground , in the trees , or in the distance , which may supply him with a meal or warn him of danger .
Parsing [sent. 2600 len. 42]: A little examination of the trunk of a tree which may be nearly covered with the scratches of opossums ascending and descending is sufficient to inform him whether one went up the night before without coming down again or not . ''
Parsing [sent. 2601 len. 6]: Fennimore Cooper lost his chance .
Parsing [sent. 2602 len. 10]: He would have known how to value these people .
Parsing [sent. 2603 len. 17]: He would n't have traded the dullest of them for the brightest Mohawk he ever invented .
Parsing [sent. 2604 len. 21]: All savages draw outline pictures upon bark ; but the resemblances are not close , and expression is usually lacking .
Parsing [sent. 2605 len. 28]: But the Australian aboriginal 's pictures of animals were nicely accurate in form , attitude , carriage ; and he put spirit into them , and expression .
Parsing [sent. 2606 len. 21]: And his pictures of white people and natives were pretty nearly as good as his pictures of the other animals .
Parsing [sent. 2607 len. 18]: He dressed his whites in the fashion of their day , both the ladies and the gentlemen .
Parsing [sent. 2608 len. 20]: As an untaught wielder of the pencil it is not likely that he has his equal among savage people .
Parsing [sent. 2609 len. 20]: His place in art -- as to drawing , not color-work -- is well up , all things considered .
Parsing [sent. 2610 len. 32]: His art is not to be classified with savage art at all , but on a plane two degrees above it and one degree above the lowest plane of civilized art .
Parsing [sent. 2611 len. 15]: To be exact , his place in art is between Botticelli and De Maurier .
Parsing [sent. 2612 len. 19]: That is to say , he could not draw as well as De Maurier but better than Boticelli .
Parsing [sent. 2613 len. 20]: In feeling , he resembles both ; also in grouping and in his preferences in the matter of subjects .
Parsing [sent. 2614 len. 46]: His `` corrobboree '' of the Australian wilds reappears in De Maurier 's Belgravian ballrooms , with clothes and the smirk of civilization added ; Botticelli 's `` Spring '' is the `` corrobboree '' further idealized , but with fewer clothes and more smirk .
Parsing [sent. 2615 len. 12]: And well enough as to intention , but -- my word !
Parsing [sent. 2616 len. 9]: The aboriginal can make a fire by friction .
Parsing [sent. 2617 len. 5]: I have tried that .
Parsing [sent. 2618 len. 13]: All savages are able to stand a good deal of physical pain .
Parsing [sent. 2619 len. 11]: The Australian aboriginal has this quality in a well-developed degree .
Parsing [sent. 2620 len. 14]: Do not read the following instances if horrors are not pleasant to you .
Parsing [sent. 2621 len. 26]: They were recorded by the Rev. Henry N. Wolloston , of Melbourne , who had been a surgeon before he became a clergyman : 1 .
Parsing [sent. 2622 len. 31]: `` In the summer of 1852 I started on horseback from Albany , King George 's Sound , to visit at Cape Riche , accompanied by a native on foot .
Parsing [sent. 2623 len. 18]: We traveled about forty miles the first day , then camped by a water-hole for the night .
Parsing [sent. 2624 len. 66]: After cooking and eating our supper , I observed the native , who had said nothing to me on the subject , collect the hot embers of the fire together , and deliberately place his right foot in the glowing mass for a moment , then suddenly withdraw it , stamping on the ground and uttering a long-drawn guttural sound of mingled pain and satisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 2625 len. 7]: This operation he repeated several times .
Parsing [sent. 2626 len. 93]: On my inquiring the meaning of his strange conduct , he only said , ` Me carpenter-make 'em ' -LRB- ' I am mending my foot ' -RRB- , and then showed me his charred great toe , the nail of which had been torn off by a tea-tree stump , in which it had been caught during the journey , and the pain of which he had borne with stoical composure until the evening , when he had an opportunity of cauterizing the wound in the primitive manner above described . ''
Parsing [sent. 2627 len. 23]: And he proceeded on the journey the next day , `` as if nothing had happened '' -- and walked thirty miles .
Parsing [sent. 2628 len. 17]: It was a strange idea , to keep a surgeon and then do his own surgery .
Parsing [sent. 2629 len. 2]: 2 .
Parsing [sent. 2630 len. 58]: `` A native about twenty-five years of age once applied to me , as a doctor , to extract the wooden barb of a spear , which , during a fight in the bush some four months previously , had entered his chest , just missing the heart , and penetrated the viscera to a considerable depth .
Parsing [sent. 2631 len. 45]: The spear had been cut off , leaving the barb behind , which continued to force its way by muscular action gradually toward the back ; and when I examined him I could feel a hard substance between the ribs below the left blade-bone .
Parsing [sent. 2632 len. 40]: I made a deep incision , and with a pair of forceps extracted the barb , which was made , as usual , of hard wood about four inches long and from half an inch to an inch thick .
Parsing [sent. 2633 len. 32]: It was very smooth , and partly digested , so to speak , by the maceration to which it had been exposed during its four months ' journey through the body .
Parsing [sent. 2634 len. 36]: The wound made by the spear had long since healed , leaving only a small cicatrix ; and after the operation , which the native bore without flinching , he appeared to suffer no pain .
Parsing [sent. 2635 len. 22]: Indeed , judging from his good state of health , the presence of the foreign matter did not materially annoy him .
Parsing [sent. 2636 len. 10]: He was perfectly well in a few days . ''
Parsing [sent. 2637 len. 7]: But No. 3 is my favorite .
Parsing [sent. 2638 len. 20]: Whenever I read it I seem to enjoy all that the patient enjoyed -- whatever it was : 3 .
Parsing [sent. 2639 len. 29]: `` Once at King George 's Sound a native presented himself to me with one leg only , and requested me to supply him with a wooden leg .
Parsing [sent. 2640 len. 15]: He had traveled in this maimed state about ninety-six miles , for this purpose .
Parsing [sent. 2641 len. 38]: I examined the limb , which had been severed just below the knee , and found that it had been charred by fire , while about two inches of the partially calcined bone protruded through the flesh .
Parsing [sent. 2642 len. 52]: I at once removed this with the saw ; and having made as presentable a stump of it as I could , covered the amputated end of the bone with a surrounding of muscle , and kept the patient a few days under my care to allow the wound to heal .
Parsing [sent. 2643 len. 28]: On inquiring , the native told me that in a fight with other black-fellows a spear had struck his leg and penetrated the bone below the knee .
Parsing [sent. 2644 len. 30]: Finding it was serious , he had recourse to the following crude and barbarous operation , which it appears is not uncommon among these people in their native state .
Parsing [sent. 2645 len. 40]: He made a fire , and dug a hole in the earth only sufficiently large to admit his leg , and deep enough to allow the wounded part to be on a level with the surface of the ground .
Parsing [sent. 2646 len. 23]: He then surrounded the limb with the live coals or charcoal , which was replenished until the leg was literally burnt off .
Parsing [sent. 2647 len. 46]: The cauterization thus applied completely checked the hemorrhage , and he was able in a day or two to hobble down to the Sound , with the aid of a long stout stick , although he was more than a week on the road . ''
Parsing [sent. 2648 len. 7]: But he was a fastidious native .
Parsing [sent. 2649 len. 23]: He soon discarded the wooden leg made for him by the doctor , because `` it had no feeling in it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2650 len. 17]: It must have had as much as the one he burnt off , I should think .
Parsing [sent. 2651 len. 6]: So much for the Aboriginals .
Parsing [sent. 2652 len. 10]: It is difficult for me to let them alone .
Parsing [sent. 2653 len. 6]: They are marvelously interesting creatures .
Parsing [sent. 2654 len. 35]: For a quarter of a century , now , the several colonial governments have housed their remnants in comfortable stations , and fed them well and taken good care of them in every way .
Parsing [sent. 2655 len. 25]: If I had found this out while I was in Australia I could have seen some of those people -- but I did n't .
Parsing [sent. 2656 len. 11]: I would walk thirty miles to see a stuffed one .
Parsing [sent. 2657 len. 8]: Australia has a slang of its own .
Parsing [sent. 2658 len. 7]: This is a matter of course .
Parsing [sent. 2659 len. 34]: The vast cattle and sheep industries , the strange aspects of the country , and the strange native animals , brute and human , are matters which would naturally breed a local slang .
Parsing [sent. 2660 len. 26]: I have notes of this slang somewhere , but at the moment I can call to mind only a few of the words and phrases .
Parsing [sent. 2661 len. 5]: They are expressive ones .
Parsing [sent. 2662 len. 25]: The wide , sterile , unpeopled deserts have created eloquent phrases like `` No Man 's Land '' and the `` Never-never Country . ''
Parsing [sent. 2663 len. 23]: Also this felicitous form : `` She lives in the Never-never Country '' -- that is , she is an old maid .
Parsing [sent. 2664 len. 17]: And this one is not without merit : `` heifer-paddock '' -- young ladies ' seminary .
Parsing [sent. 2665 len. 24]: `` Bail up '' and `` stick up '' equivalent of our highwayman-term to `` hold up '' a stage-coach or a train .
Parsing [sent. 2666 len. 15]: `` New-chum '' is the equivalent of our `` tenderfoot '' -- new arrival .
Parsing [sent. 2667 len. 11]: And then there is the immortal `` My word ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2668 len. 5]: We must import it .
Parsing [sent. 2669 len. 5]: `` M-y word ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2670 len. 14]: In cold print it is the equivalent of our `` Ger-rreat Caesar ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2671 len. 23]: but spoken with the proper Australian unction and fervency , it is worth six of it for grace and charm and expressiveness .
Parsing [sent. 2672 len. 24]: Our form is rude and explosive ; it is not suited to the drawing-room or the heifer-paddock ; but `` M-y word ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2673 len. 20]: is , and is music to the ear , too , when the utterer knows how to say it .
Parsing [sent. 2674 len. 23]: I saw it in print several times on the Pacific Ocean , but it struck me coldly , it aroused no sympathy .
Parsing [sent. 2675 len. 34]: That was because it was the dead corpse of the thing , the soul was not there -- the tones were lacking -- the informing spirit -- the deep feeling -- the eloquence .
Parsing [sent. 2676 len. 16]: But the first time I heard an Australian say it , it was positively thrilling .
Parsing [sent. 2677 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXIII .
Parsing [sent. 2678 len. 15]: Be careless in your dress if you must , but keep a tidy soul .
Parsing [sent. 2679 len. 9]: -- Pudd ` nhead Wilson 's New Calendar .
Parsing [sent. 2680 len. 33]: We left Adelaide in due course , and went to Horsham , in the colony of Victoria ; a good deal of a journey , if I remember rightly , but pleasant .
Parsing [sent. 2681 len. 58]: Horsham sits in a plain which is as level as a floor -- one of those famous dead levels which Australian books describe so often ; gray , bare , sombre , melancholy , baked , cracked , in the tedious long drouths , but a horizonless ocean of vivid green grass the day after a rain .
Parsing [sent. 2682 len. 26]: A country town , peaceful , reposeful , inviting , full of snug homes , with garden plots , and plenty of shrubbery and flowers .
Parsing [sent. 2683 len. 6]: `` Horsham , October 17 .
Parsing [sent. 2684 len. 4]: At the hotel .
Parsing [sent. 2685 len. 4]: The weather divine .
Parsing [sent. 2686 len. 19]: Across the way , in front of the London Bank of Australia , is a very handsome cottonwood .
Parsing [sent. 2687 len. 11]: It is in opulent leaf , and every leaf perfect .
Parsing [sent. 2688 len. 20]: The full power of the on-rushing spring is upon it , and I imagine I can see it grow .
Parsing [sent. 2689 len. 59]: Alongside the bank and a little way back in the garden there is a row of soaring fountain-sprays of delicate feathery foliage quivering in the breeze , and mottled with flashes of light that shift and play through the mass like flash-lights through an opal -- a most beautiful tree , and a striking contrast to the cottonwood .
Parsing [sent. 2690 len. 54]: Every leaf of the cottonwood is distinctly defined -- it is a kodak for faithful , hard , unsentimental detail ; the other an impressionist picture , delicious to look upon , full of a subtle and exquisite charm , but all details fused in a swoon of vague and soft loveliness . ''
Parsing [sent. 2691 len. 18]: It turned out , upon inquiry , to be a pepper tree -- an importation from China .
Parsing [sent. 2692 len. 10]: It has a silky sheen , soft and rich .
Parsing [sent. 2693 len. 16]: I saw some that had long red bunches of currant-like berries ambushed among the foliage .
Parsing [sent. 2694 len. 20]: At a distance , in certain lights , they give the tree a pinkish tint and a new charm .
Parsing [sent. 2695 len. 10]: There is an agricultural college eight miles from Horsham .
Parsing [sent. 2696 len. 10]: We were driven out to it by its chief .
Parsing [sent. 2697 len. 32]: The conveyance was an open wagon ; the time , noonday ; no wind ; the sky without a cloud , the sunshine brilliant -- and the mercury at 92 deg .
Parsing [sent. 2698 len. 4]: in the shade .
Parsing [sent. 2699 len. 35]: In some countries an indolent unsheltered drive of an hour and a half under such conditions would have been a sweltering and prostrating experience ; but there was nothing of that in this case .
Parsing [sent. 2700 len. 8]: It is a climate that is perfect .
Parsing [sent. 2701 len. 49]: There was no sense of heat ; indeed , there was no heat ; the air was fine and pure and exhilarating ; if the drive had lasted half a day I think we should not have felt any discomfort , or grown silent or droopy or tired .
Parsing [sent. 2702 len. 15]: Of course , the secret of it was the exceeding dryness of the atmosphere .
Parsing [sent. 2703 len. 6]: In that plain 112 deg .
Parsing [sent. 2704 len. 18]: in the shade is without doubt no harder upon a man than is 88 or 90 deg .
Parsing [sent. 2705 len. 4]: in New York .
Parsing [sent. 2706 len. 24]: The road lay through the middle of an empty space which seemed to me to be a hundred yards wide between the fences .
Parsing [sent. 2707 len. 22]: I was not given the width in yards , but only in chains and perches -- and furlongs , I think .
Parsing [sent. 2708 len. 22]: I would have given a good deal to know what the width was , but I did not pursue the matter .
Parsing [sent. 2709 len. 40]: I think it is best to put up with information the way you get it ; and seem satisfied with it , and surprised at it , and grateful for it , and say , `` My word ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2710 len. 5]: and never let on .
Parsing [sent. 2711 len. 30]: It was a wide space ; I could tell you how wide , in chains and perches and furlongs and things , but that would not help you any .
Parsing [sent. 2712 len. 24]: Those things sound well , but they are shadowy and indefinite , like troy weight and avoirdupois ; nobody knows what they mean .
Parsing [sent. 2713 len. 35]: When you buy a pound of a drug and the man asks you which you want , troy or avoirdupois , it is best to say `` Yes , '' and shift the subject .
Parsing [sent. 2714 len. 15]: They said that the wide space dates from the earliest sheep and cattle-raising days .
Parsing [sent. 2715 len. 50]: People had to drive their stock long distances -- immense journeys -- from worn-out places to new ones where were water and fresh pasturage ; and this wide space had to be left in grass and unfenced , or the stock would have starved to death in the transit .
Parsing [sent. 2716 len. 63]: On the way we saw the usual birds -- the beautiful little green parrots , the magpie , and some others ; and also the slender native bird of modest plumage and the eternally-forgettable name -- the bird that is the smartest among birds , and can give a parrot 30 to 1 in the game and then talk him to death .
Parsing [sent. 2717 len. 9]: I can not recall that bird 's name .
Parsing [sent. 2718 len. 20]: I think it begins with M. I wish it began with G. or something that a person can remember .
Parsing [sent. 2719 len. 16]: The magpie was out in great force , in the fields and on the fences .
Parsing [sent. 2720 len. 27]: He is a handsome large creature , with snowy white decorations , and is a singer ; he has a murmurous rich note that is lovely .
Parsing [sent. 2721 len. 26]: He was once modest , even diffident ; but he lost all that when he found out that he was Australia 's sole musical bird .
Parsing [sent. 2722 len. 43]: He has talent , and cuteness , and impudence ; and in his tame state he is a most satisfactory pet -- never coming when he is called , always coming when he is n't , and studying disobedience as an accomplishment .
Parsing [sent. 2723 len. 19]: He is not confined , but loafs all over the house and grounds , like the laughing jackass .
Parsing [sent. 2724 len. 28]: I think he learns to talk , I know he learns to sing tunes , and his friends say that he knows how to steal without learning .
Parsing [sent. 2725 len. 10]: I was acquainted with a tame magpie in Melbourne .
Parsing [sent. 2726 len. 17]: He had lived in a lady 's house several years , and believed he owned it .
Parsing [sent. 2727 len. 15]: The lady had tamed him , and in return he had tamed the lady .
Parsing [sent. 2728 len. 35]: He was always on deck when not wanted , always having his own way , always tyrannizing over the dog , and always making the cat 's life a slow sorrow and a martyrdom .
Parsing [sent. 2729 len. 56]: He knew a number of tunes and could sing them in perfect time and tune ; and would do it , too , at any time that silence was wanted ; and then encore himself and do it again ; but if he was asked to sing he would go out and take a walk .
Parsing [sent. 2730 len. 28]: It was long believed that fruit trees would not grow in that baked and waterless plain around Horsham , but the agricultural college has dissipated that idea .
Parsing [sent. 2731 len. 34]: Its ample nurseries were producing oranges , apricots , lemons , almonds , peaches , cherries , 48 varieties of apples -- in fact , all manner of fruits , and in abundance .
Parsing [sent. 2732 len. 18]: The trees did not seem to miss the water ; they were in vigorous and flourishing condition .
Parsing [sent. 2733 len. 23]: Experiments are made with different soils , to see what things thrive best in them and what climates are best for them .
Parsing [sent. 2734 len. 50]: A man who is ignorantly trying to produce upon his farm things not suited to its soil and its other conditions can make a journey to the college from anywhere in Australia , and go back with a change of scheme which will make his farm productive and profitable .
Parsing [sent. 2735 len. 27]: There were forty pupils there -- a few of them farmers , relearning their trade , the rest young men mainly from the cities -- novices .
Parsing [sent. 2736 len. 23]: It seemed a strange thing that an agricultural college should have an attraction for city-bred youths , but such is the fact .
Parsing [sent. 2737 len. 34]: They are good stuff , too ; they are above the agricultural average of intelligence , and they come without any inherited prejudices in favor of hoary ignorances made sacred by long descent .
Parsing [sent. 2738 len. 33]: The students work all day in the fields , the nurseries , and the shearing-sheds , learning and doing all the practical work of the business -- three days in a week .
Parsing [sent. 2739 len. 10]: On the other three they study and hear lectures .
Parsing [sent. 2740 len. 19]: They are taught the beginnings of such sciences as bear upon agriculture -- like chemistry , for instance .
Parsing [sent. 2741 len. 12]: We saw the sophomore class in sheep-shearing shear a dozen sheep .
Parsing [sent. 2742 len. 11]: They did it by hand , not with the machine .
Parsing [sent. 2743 len. 27]: The sheep was seized and flung down on his side and held there ; and the students took off his coat with great celerity and adroitness .
Parsing [sent. 2744 len. 36]: Sometimes they clipped off a sample of the sheep , but that is customary with shearers , and they do n't mind it ; they do n't even mind it as much as the sheep .
Parsing [sent. 2745 len. 14]: They dab a splotch of sheep-dip on the place and go right ahead .
Parsing [sent. 2746 len. 8]: The coat of wool was unbelievably thick .
Parsing [sent. 2747 len. 22]: Before the shearing the sheep looked like the fat woman in the circus ; after it he looked like a bench .
Parsing [sent. 2748 len. 12]: He was clipped to the skin ; and smoothly and uniformly .
Parsing [sent. 2749 len. 17]: The fleece comes from him all in one piece and has the spread of a blanket .
Parsing [sent. 2750 len. 37]: The college was flying the Australian flag -- the gridiron of England smuggled up in the northwest corner of a big red field that had the random stars of the Southern Cross wandering around over it .
Parsing [sent. 2751 len. 7]: From Horsham we went to Stawell .
Parsing [sent. 2752 len. 3]: By rail .
Parsing [sent. 2753 len. 7]: Still in the colony of Victoria .
Parsing [sent. 2754 len. 7]: Stawell is in the gold-mining country .
Parsing [sent. 2755 len. 40]: In the bank-safe was half a peck of surface-gold -- gold dust , grain gold ; rich ; pure in fact , and pleasant to sift through one 's fingers ; and would be pleasanter if it would stick .
Parsing [sent. 2756 len. 21]: And there were a couple of gold bricks , very heavy to handle , and worth $ 7,500 a piece .
Parsing [sent. 2757 len. 35]: They were from a very valuable quartz mine ; a lady owns two-thirds of it ; she has an income of $ 75,000 a month from it , and is able to keep house .
Parsing [sent. 2758 len. 21]: The Stawell region is not productive of gold only ; it has great vineyards , and produces exceptionally fine wines .
Parsing [sent. 2759 len. 20]: One of these vineyards -- the Great Western , owned by Mr. Irving -- is regarded as a model .
Parsing [sent. 2760 len. 6]: Its product has reputation abroad .
Parsing [sent. 2761 len. 24]: It yields a choice champagne and a fine claret , and its hock took a prize in France two or three years ago .
Parsing [sent. 2762 len. 32]: The champagne is kept in a maze of passages under ground , cut in the rock , to secure it an even temperature during the three-year term required to perfect it .
Parsing [sent. 2763 len. 10]: In those vaults I saw 120,000 bottles of champagne .
Parsing [sent. 2764 len. 24]: The colony of Victoria has a population of 1,000,000 , and those people are said to drink 25,000,000 bottles of champagne per year .
Parsing [sent. 2765 len. 7]: The dryest community on the earth .
Parsing [sent. 2766 len. 11]: The government has lately reduced the duty upon foreign wines .
Parsing [sent. 2767 len. 9]: That is one of the unkindnesses of Protection .
Parsing [sent. 2768 len. 40]: A man invests years of work and a vast sum of money in a worthy enterprise , upon the faith of existing laws ; then the law is changed , and the man is robbed by his own government .
Parsing [sent. 2769 len. 55]: On the way back to Stawell we had a chance to see a group of boulders called the Three Sisters -- a curiosity oddly located ; for it was upon high ground , with the land sloping away from it , and no height above it from whence the boulders could have rolled down .
Parsing [sent. 2770 len. 8]: Relics of an early ice-drift , perhaps .
Parsing [sent. 2771 len. 5]: They are noble boulders .
Parsing [sent. 2772 len. 19]: One of them has the size and smoothness and plump sphericity of a balloon of the biggest pattern .
Parsing [sent. 2773 len. 16]: The road led through a forest of great gum-trees , lean and scraggy and sorrowful .
Parsing [sent. 2774 len. 13]: The road was cream-white -- a clayey kind of earth , apparently .
Parsing [sent. 2775 len. 15]: Along it toiled occasional freight wagons , drawn by long double files of oxen .
Parsing [sent. 2776 len. 25]: Those wagons were going a journey of two hundred miles , I was told , and were running a successful opposition to the railway !
Parsing [sent. 2777 len. 10]: The railways are owned and run by the government .
Parsing [sent. 2778 len. 18]: Those sad gums stood up out of the dry white clay , pictures of patience and resignation .
Parsing [sent. 2779 len. 21]: It is a tree that can get along without water ; still it is fond of it -- ravenously so .
Parsing [sent. 2780 len. 31]: It is a very intelligent tree and will detect the presence of hidden water at a distance of fifty feet , and send out slender long root-fibres to prospect it .
Parsing [sent. 2781 len. 20]: They will find it ; and will also get at it even through a cement wall six inches thick .
Parsing [sent. 2782 len. 23]: Once a cement water-pipe under ground at Stawell began to gradually reduce its output , and finally ceased altogether to deliver water .
Parsing [sent. 2783 len. 23]: Upon examining into the matter it was found stopped up , wadded compactly with a mass of root-fibres , delicate and hair-like .
Parsing [sent. 2784 len. 36]: How this stuff had gotten into the pipe was a puzzle for some little time ; finally it was found that it had crept in through a crack that was almost invisible to the eye .
Parsing [sent. 2785 len. 16]: A gum tree forty feet away had tapped the pipe and was drinking the water .
Parsing [sent. 2786 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXIV .
Parsing [sent. 2787 len. 13]: There is no such thing as `` the Queen 's English . ''
Parsing [sent. 2788 len. 21]: The property has gone into the hands of a joint stock company and we own the bulk of the shares !
Parsing [sent. 2789 len. 9]: -- Pudd ` nhead Wilson 's New Calendar .
Parsing [sent. 2790 len. 13]: Frequently , in Australia , one has cloud-effects of an unfamiliar sort .
Parsing [sent. 2791 len. 16]: We had this kind of scenery , finely staged , all the way to Ballarat .
Parsing [sent. 2792 len. 11]: Consequently we saw more sky than country on that journey .
Parsing [sent. 2793 len. 41]: At one time a great stretch of the vault was densely flecked with wee ragged-edged flakes of painfully white cloud-stuff , all of one shape and size , and equidistant apart , with narrow cracks of adorable blue showing between .
Parsing [sent. 2794 len. 14]: The whole was suggestive of a hurricane of snow-flakes drifting across the skies .
Parsing [sent. 2795 len. 42]: By and by these flakes fused themselves together in interminable lines , with shady faint hollows between the lines , the long satin-surfaced rollers following each other in simulated movement , and enchantingly counterfeiting the majestic march of a flowing sea .
Parsing [sent. 2796 len. 58]: Later , the sea solidified itself ; then gradually broke up its mass into innumerable lofty white pillars of about one size , and ranged these across the firmament , in receding and fading perspective , in the similitude of a stupendous colonnade -- a mirage without a doubt flung from the far Gates of the Hereafter .
Parsing [sent. 2797 len. 7]: The approaches to Ballarat were beautiful .
Parsing [sent. 2798 len. 26]: The features , great green expanses of rolling pasture-land , bisected by eye-contenting hedges of commingled new-gold and old-gold gorse -- and a lovely lake .
Parsing [sent. 2799 len. 30]: One must put in the pause , there , to fetch the reader up with a slight jolt , and keep him from gliding by without noticing the lake .
Parsing [sent. 2800 len. 26]: One must notice it ; for a lovely lake is not as common a thing along the railways of Australia as are the dry places .
Parsing [sent. 2801 len. 15]: Ninety-two in the shade again , but balmy and comfortable , fresh and bracing .
Parsing [sent. 2802 len. 4]: A perfect climate .
Parsing [sent. 2803 len. 24]: Forty-five years ago the site now occupied by the City of Ballarat was a sylvan solitude as quiet as Eden and as lovely .
Parsing [sent. 2804 len. 7]: Nobody had ever heard of it .
Parsing [sent. 2805 len. 19]: On the 25th of August , 1851 , the first great gold-strike made in Australia was made here .
Parsing [sent. 2806 len. 21]: The wandering prospectors who made it scraped up two pounds and a half of gold the first day-worth $ 600 .
Parsing [sent. 2807 len. 13]: A few days later the place was a hive -- a town .
Parsing [sent. 2808 len. 26]: The news of the strike spread everywhere in a sort of instantaneous way -- spread like a flash to the very ends of the earth .
Parsing [sent. 2809 len. 16]: A celebrity so prompt and so universal has hardly been paralleled in history , perhaps .
Parsing [sent. 2810 len. 25]: It was as if the name BALLARAT had suddenly been written on the sky , where all the world could read it at once .
Parsing [sent. 2811 len. 38]: The smaller discoveries made in the colony of New South Wales three months before had already started emigrants toward Australia ; they had been coming as a stream , but they came as a flood , now .
Parsing [sent. 2812 len. 24]: A hundred thousand people poured into Melbourne from England and other countries in a single month , and flocked away to the mines .
Parsing [sent. 2813 len. 122]: The crews of the ships that brought them flocked with them ; the clerks in the government offices followed ; so did the cooks , the maids , the coachmen , the butlers , and the other domestic servants ; so did the carpenters , the smiths , the plumbers , the painters , the reporters , the editors , the lawyers , the clients , the barkeepers , the bummers , the blacklegs , the thieves , the loose women , the grocers , the butchers , the bakers , the doctors , the druggists , the nurses ; so did the police ; even officials of high and hitherto envied place threw up their positions and joined the procession .
Parsing [sent. 2814 len. 51]: This roaring avalanche swept out of Melbourne and left it desolate , Sunday-like , paralyzed , everything at a stand-still , the ships lying idle at anchor , all signs of life departed , all sounds stilled save the rasping of the cloud-shadows as they scraped across the vacant streets .
Parsing [sent. 2815 len. 28]: That grassy and leafy paradise at Ballarat was soon ripped open , and lacerated and scarified and gutted , in the feverish search for its hidden riches .
Parsing [sent. 2816 len. 28]: There is nothing like surface-mining to snatch the graces and beauties and benignities out of a paradise , and make an odious and repulsive spectacle of it .
Parsing [sent. 2817 len. 5]: What fortunes were made !
Parsing [sent. 2818 len. 26]: Immigrants got rich while the ship unloaded and reloaded -- and went back home for good in the same cabin they had come out in !
Parsing [sent. 2819 len. 5]: Not all of them .
Parsing [sent. 2820 len. 3]: Only some .
Parsing [sent. 2821 len. 27]: I saw the others in Ballarat myself , forty-five years later -- what were left of them by time and death and the disposition to rove .
Parsing [sent. 2822 len. 25]: They were young and gay , then ; they are patriarchal and grave , now ; and they do not get excited any more .
Parsing [sent. 2823 len. 6]: They talk of the Past .
Parsing [sent. 2824 len. 5]: They live in it .
Parsing [sent. 2825 len. 9]: Their life is a dream , a retrospection .
Parsing [sent. 2826 len. 10]: Ballarat was a great region for `` nuggets . ''
Parsing [sent. 2827 len. 11]: No such nuggets were found in California as Ballarat produced .
Parsing [sent. 2828 len. 15]: In fact , the Ballarat region has yielded the largest ones known to history .
Parsing [sent. 2829 len. 16]: Two of them weighed about 180 pounds each , and together were worth $ 90,000 .
Parsing [sent. 2830 len. 16]: They were offered to any poor person who would shoulder them and carry them away .
Parsing [sent. 2831 len. 12]: Gold was so plentiful that it made people liberal like that .
Parsing [sent. 2832 len. 12]: Ballarat was a swarming city of tents in the early days .
Parsing [sent. 2833 len. 12]: Everybody was happy , for a time , and apparently prosperous .
Parsing [sent. 2834 len. 4]: Then came trouble .
Parsing [sent. 2835 len. 9]: The government swooped down with a mining tax .
Parsing [sent. 2836 len. 38]: And in its worst form , too ; for it was not a tax upon what the miner had taken out , but upon what he was going to take out -- if he could find it .
Parsing [sent. 2837 len. 24]: It was a license tax -- license to work his claim -- and it had to be paid before he could begin digging .
Parsing [sent. 2838 len. 4]: Consider the situation .
Parsing [sent. 2839 len. 8]: No business is so uncertain as surface-mining .
Parsing [sent. 2840 len. 12]: Your claim may be good , and it may be worthless .
Parsing [sent. 2841 len. 58]: It may make you well off in a month ; and then again you may have to dig and slave for half a year , at heavy expense , only to find out at last that the gold is not there in cost-paying quantity , and that your time and your hard work have been thrown away .
Parsing [sent. 2842 len. 43]: It might be wise policy to advance the miner a monthly sum to encourage him to develop the country 's riches ; but to tax him monthly in advance instead -- why , such a thing was never dreamed of in America .
Parsing [sent. 2843 len. 18]: There , neither the claim itself nor its products , howsoever rich or poor , were taxed .
Parsing [sent. 2844 len. 28]: The Ballarat miners protested , petitioned , complained -- it was of no use ; the government held its ground , and went on collecting the tax .
Parsing [sent. 2845 len. 19]: And not by pleasant methods , but by ways which must have been very galling to free people .
Parsing [sent. 2846 len. 11]: The rumblings of a coming storm began to be audible .
Parsing [sent. 2847 len. 22]: By and by there was a result ; and I think it may be called the finest thing in Australasian history .
Parsing [sent. 2848 len. 33]: It was a revolution -- small in size ; but great politically ; it was a strike for liberty , a struggle for a principle , a stand against injustice and oppression .
Parsing [sent. 2849 len. 43]: It was the Barons and John , over again ; it was Hampden and Ship-Money ; it was Concord and Lexington ; small beginnings , all of them , but all of them great in political results , all of them epoch-making .
Parsing [sent. 2850 len. 13]: It is another instance of a victory won by a lost battle .
Parsing [sent. 2851 len. 18]: It adds an honorable page to history ; the people know it and are proud of it .
Parsing [sent. 2852 len. 22]: They keep green the memory of the men who fell at the Eureka Stockade , and Peter Lalor has his monument .
Parsing [sent. 2853 len. 9]: The surface-soil of Ballarat was full of gold .
Parsing [sent. 2854 len. 23]: This soil the miners ripped and tore and trenched and harried and disembowled , and made it yield up its immense treasure .
Parsing [sent. 2855 len. 25]: Then they went down into the earth with deep shafts , seeking the gravelly beds of ancient rivers and brooks -- and found them .
Parsing [sent. 2856 len. 34]: They followed the courses of these streams , and gutted them , sending the gravel up in buckets to the upper world , and washing out of it its enormous deposits of gold .
Parsing [sent. 2857 len. 20]: The next biggest of the two monster nuggets mentioned above came from an old river-channel 180 feet under ground .
Parsing [sent. 2858 len. 7]: Finally the quartz lodes were attacked .
Parsing [sent. 2859 len. 7]: That is not poor-man 's mining .
Parsing [sent. 2860 len. 12]: Quartz-mining and milling require capital , and staying-power , and patience .
Parsing [sent. 2861 len. 25]: Big companies were formed , and for several decades , now , the lodes have been successfully worked , and have yielded great wealth .
Parsing [sent. 2862 len. 66]: Since the gold discovery in 1853 the Ballarat mines -- taking the three kinds of mining together -- have contributed to the world 's pocket something over three hundred millions of dollars , which is to say that this nearly invisible little spot on the earth 's surface has yielded about one-fourth as much gold in forty-four years as all California has yielded in forty-seven .
Parsing [sent. 2863 len. 26]: The Californian aggregate , from 1848 to 1895 , inclusive , as reported by the Statistician of the United States Mint , is $ 1,265,217,217 .
Parsing [sent. 2864 len. 11]: A citizen told me a curious thing about those mines .
Parsing [sent. 2865 len. 17]: With all my experience of mining I had never heard of anything of the sort before .
Parsing [sent. 2866 len. 24]: The main gold reef runs about north and south -- of course -- for that is the custom of a rich gold reef .
Parsing [sent. 2867 len. 10]: At Ballarat its course is between walls of slate .
Parsing [sent. 2868 len. 62]: Now the citizen told me that throughout a stretch of twelve miles along the reef , the reef is crossed at intervals by a straight black streak of a carbonaceous nature -- a streak in the slate ; a streak no thicker than a pencil -- and that wherever it crosses the reef you will certainly find gold at the junction .
Parsing [sent. 2869 len. 6]: It is called the Indicator .
Parsing [sent. 2870 len. 43]: Thirty feet on each side of the Indicator -LRB- and down in the slate , of course -RRB- is a still finer streak -- a streak as fine as a pencil mark ; and indeed , that is its name Pencil Mark .
Parsing [sent. 2871 len. 48]: Whenever you find the Pencil Mark you know that thirty feet from it is the Indicator ; you measure the distance , excavate , find the Indicator , trace it straight to the reef , and sink your shaft ; your fortune is made , for certain .
Parsing [sent. 2872 len. 9]: If that is true , it is curious .
Parsing [sent. 2873 len. 6]: And it is curious anyway .
Parsing [sent. 2874 len. 30]: Ballarat is a town of only 40,000 population ; and yet , since it is in Australia , it has every essential of an advanced and enlightened big city .
Parsing [sent. 2875 len. 7]: This is pure matter of course .
Parsing [sent. 2876 len. 8]: I must stop dwelling upon these things .
Parsing [sent. 2877 len. 25]: It is hard to keep from dwelling upon them , though ; for it is difficult to get away from the surprise of it .
Parsing [sent. 2878 len. 77]: I will let the other details go , this time , but I must allow myself to mention that this little town has a park of 326 acres ; a flower garden of 83 acres , with an elaborate and expensive fernery in it and some costly and unusually fine statuary ; and an artificial lake covering 600 acres , equipped with a fleet of 200 shells , small sail boats , and little steam yachts .
Parsing [sent. 2879 len. 17]: At this point I strike out some other praiseful things which I was tempted to add .
Parsing [sent. 2880 len. 47]: I do not strike them out because they were not true or not well said , but because I find them better said by another man -- and a man more competent to testify , too , because he belongs on the ground , and knows .
Parsing [sent. 2881 len. 72]: I clip them from a chatty speech delivered some years ago by Mr. William Little , who was at that time mayor of Ballarat : `` The language of our citizens , in this as in other parts of Australasia , is mostly healthy Anglo-Saxon , free from Americanisms , vulgarisms , and the conflicting dialects of our Fatherland , and is pure enough to suit a Trench or a Latham .
Parsing [sent. 2882 len. 21]: Our youth , aided by climatic influence , are in point of physique and comeliness unsurpassed in the Sunny South .
Parsing [sent. 2883 len. 36]: Our young men are well ordered ; and our maidens , ` not stepping over the bounds of modesty , ' are as fair as Psyches , dispensing smiles as charming as November flowers . ''
Parsing [sent. 2884 len. 21]: The closing clause has the seeming of a rather frosty compliment , but that is apparent only , not real .
Parsing [sent. 2885 len. 5]: November is summer-time there .
Parsing [sent. 2886 len. 12]: His compliment to the local purity of the language is warranted .
Parsing [sent. 2887 len. 14]: It is quite free from impurities ; this is acknowledged far and wide .
Parsing [sent. 2888 len. 26]: As in the German Empire all cultivated people claim to speak Hanovarian German , so in Australasia all cultivated people claim to speak Ballarat English .
Parsing [sent. 2889 len. 46]: Even in England this cult has made considerable progress , and now that it is favored by the two great Universities , the time is not far away when Ballarat English will come into general use among the educated classes of Great Britain at large .
Parsing [sent. 2890 len. 21]: Its great merit is , that it is shorter than ordinary English -- that is , it is more compressed .
Parsing [sent. 2891 len. 25]: At first you have some difficulty in understanding it when it is spoken as rapidly as the orator whom I have quoted speaks it .
Parsing [sent. 2892 len. 8]: An illustration will show what I mean .
Parsing [sent. 2893 len. 50]: When he called and I handed him a chair , he bowed and said : `` Q. '' Presently , when we were lighting our cigars , he held a match to mine and I said : `` Thank you , '' and he said : `` Km . ''
Parsing [sent. 2894 len. 4]: Then I saw .
Parsing [sent. 2895 len. 29]: ` Q ' is the end of the phrase `` I thank you '' ` Km ' is the end of the phrase `` You are welcome . ''
Parsing [sent. 2896 len. 22]: Mr. Little puts no emphasis upon either of them , but delivers them so reduced that they hardly have a sound .
Parsing [sent. 2897 len. 50]: All Ballarat English is like that , and the effect is very soft and pleasant ; it takes all the hardness and harshness out of our tongue and gives to it a delicate whispery and vanishing cadence which charms the ear like the faint rustling of the forest leaves .
Parsing [sent. 2898 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXV .
Parsing [sent. 2899 len. 4]: `` Classic . ''
Parsing [sent. 2900 len. 10]: A book which people praise and do n't read .
Parsing [sent. 2901 len. 9]: -- Pudd ` nhead Wilson 's New Calendar .
Parsing [sent. 2902 len. 9]: On the rail again -- bound for Bendigo .
Parsing [sent. 2903 len. 6]: From diary : October 23 .
Parsing [sent. 2904 len. 40]: Got up at 6 , left at 7.30 ; soon reached Castlemaine , one of the rich gold-fields of the early days ; waited several hours for a train ; left at 3.40 and reached Bendigo in an hour .
Parsing [sent. 2905 len. 41]: For comrade , a Catholic priest who was better than I was , but did n't seem to know it -- a man full of graces of the heart , the mind , and the spirit ; a lovable man .
Parsing [sent. 2906 len. 4]: He will rise .
Parsing [sent. 2907 len. 8]: He will be a bishop some day .
Parsing [sent. 2908 len. 4]: Later an Archbishop .
Parsing [sent. 2909 len. 4]: Later a Cardinal .
Parsing [sent. 2910 len. 7]: Finally an Archangel , I hope .
Parsing [sent. 2911 len. 42]: And then he will recall me when I say , `` Do you remember that trip we made from Ballarat to Bendigo , when you were nothing but Father C. , and I was nothing to what I am now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2912 len. 13]: It has actually taken nine hours to come from Ballarat to Bendigo .
Parsing [sent. 2913 len. 8]: We could have saved seven by walking .
Parsing [sent. 2914 len. 7]: However , there was no hurry .
Parsing [sent. 2915 len. 12]: Bendigo was another of the rich strikes of the early days .
Parsing [sent. 2916 len. 33]: It does a great quartz-mining business , now -- that business which , more than any other that I know of , teaches patience , and requires grit and a steady nerve .
Parsing [sent. 2917 len. 17]: The town is full of towering chimney-stacks , and hoisting-works , and looks like a petroleum-city .
Parsing [sent. 2918 len. 43]: Speaking of patience ; for example , one of the local companies went steadily on with its deep borings and searchings without show of gold or a penny of reward for eleven years -- then struck it , and became suddenly rich .
Parsing [sent. 2919 len. 26]: The eleven years ' work had cost $ 55,000 , and the first gold found was a grain the size of a pin 's head .
Parsing [sent. 2920 len. 26]: It is kept under locks and bars , as a precious thing , and is reverently shown to the visitor , `` hats off . ''
Parsing [sent. 2921 len. 11]: When I saw it I had not heard its history .
Parsing [sent. 2922 len. 5]: `` It is gold .
Parsing [sent. 2923 len. 7]: Examine it -- take the glass .
Parsing [sent. 2924 len. 11]: Now how much should you say it is worth ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2925 len. 21]: I said : `` I should say about two cents ; or in your English dialect , four farthings . ''
Parsing [sent. 2926 len. 9]: `` Well , it cost L11 ,000 . ''
Parsing [sent. 2927 len. 6]: `` Oh , come ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2928 len. 6]: `` Yes , it did .
Parsing [sent. 2929 len. 24]: Ballarat and Bendigo have produced the three monumental nuggets of the world , and this one is the monumentalest one of the three .
Parsing [sent. 2930 len. 17]: The other two represent L9 ,000 a piece ; this one a couple of thousand more .
Parsing [sent. 2931 len. 23]: It is small , and not much to look at , but it is entitled to -LRB- its -RRB- name -- Adam .
Parsing [sent. 2932 len. 18]: It is the Adam-nugget of this mine , and its children run up into the millions . ''
Parsing [sent. 2933 len. 60]: Speaking of patience again , another of the mines was worked , under heavy expenses , during 17 years before pay was struck , and still another one compelled a wait of 21 years before pay was struck ; then , in both instances , the outlay was all back in a year or two , with compound interest .
Parsing [sent. 2934 len. 10]: Bendigo has turned out even more gold than Ballarat .
Parsing [sent. 2935 len. 18]: The two together have produced $ 650,000,000 worth -- which is half as much as California produced .
Parsing [sent. 2936 len. 33]: It was through Mr. Blank -- not to go into particulars about his name -- it was mainly through Mr. Blank that my stay in Bendigo was made memorably pleasant and interesting .
Parsing [sent. 2937 len. 7]: He explained this to me himself .
Parsing [sent. 2938 len. 244]: He told me that it was through his influence that the city government invited me to the town-hall to hear complimentary speeches and respond to them ; that it was through his influence that I had been taken on a long pleasure-drive through the city and shown its notable features ; that it was through his influence that I was invited to visit the great mines ; that it was through his influence that I was taken to the hospital and allowed to see the convalescent Chinaman who had been attacked at midnight in his lonely hut eight weeks before by robbers , and stabbed forty-six times and scalped besides ; that it was through his influence that when I arrived this awful spectacle of piecings and patchings and bandagings was sitting up in his cot letting on to read one of my books ; that it was through his influence that efforts had been made to get the Catholic Archbishop of Bendigo to invite me to dinner ; that it was through his influence that efforts had been made to get the Anglican Bishop of Bendigo to ask me to supper ; that it was through his influence that the dean of the editorial fraternity had driven me through the woodsy outlying country and shown me , from the summit of Lone Tree Hill , the mightiest and loveliest expanse of forest-clad mountain and valley that I had seen in all Australia .
Parsing [sent. 2939 len. 51]: And when he asked me what had most impressed me in Bendigo and I answered and said it was the taste and the public spirit which had adorned the streets with 105 miles of shade trees , he said that it was through his influence that it had been done .
Parsing [sent. 2940 len. 9]: But I am not representing him quite correctly .
Parsing [sent. 2941 len. 75]: He did not say it was through his influence that all these things had happened -- for that would have been coarse ; he merely conveyed that idea ; conveyed it so subtly that I only caught it fleetingly , as one catches vagrant faint breaths of perfume when one traverses the meadows in summer ; conveyed it without offense and without any suggestion of egoism or ostentation -- but conveyed it , nevertheless .
Parsing [sent. 2942 len. 31]: He was an Irishman ; an educated gentleman ; grave , and kindly , and courteous ; a bachelor , and about forty-five or possibly fifty years old , apparently .
Parsing [sent. 2943 len. 18]: He called upon me at the hotel , and it was there that we had this talk .
Parsing [sent. 2944 len. 12]: He made me like him , and did it without trouble .
Parsing [sent. 2945 len. 24]: This was partly through his winning and gentle ways , but mainly through the amazing familiarity with my books which his conversation showed .
Parsing [sent. 2946 len. 36]: He was down to date with them , too ; and if he had made them the study of his life he could hardly have been better posted as to their contents than he was .
Parsing [sent. 2947 len. 14]: He made me better satisfied with myself than I had ever been before .
Parsing [sent. 2948 len. 38]: It was plain that he had a deep fondness for humor , yet he never laughed ; he never even chuckled ; in fact , humor could not win to outward expression on his face at all .
Parsing [sent. 2949 len. 45]: No , he was always grave -- tenderly , pensively grave ; but he made me laugh , all along ; and this was very trying -- and very pleasant at the same time -- for it was at quotations from my own books .
Parsing [sent. 2950 len. 18]: When he was going , he turned and said : `` You do n't remember me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2951 len. 3]: `` I ?
Parsing [sent. 2952 len. 4]: Why , no .
Parsing [sent. 2953 len. 6]: Have we met before ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2954 len. 11]: `` No , it was a matter of correspondence . ''
Parsing [sent. 2955 len. 4]: `` Correspondence ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2956 len. 7]: `` Yes , many years ago .
Parsing [sent. 2957 len. 4]: Twelve or fifteen .
Parsing [sent. 2958 len. 6]: Oh , longer than that .
Parsing [sent. 2959 len. 10]: But of course you -- '' A musing pause .
Parsing [sent. 2960 len. 12]: Then he said : `` Do you remember Corrigan Castle ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2961 len. 9]: `` N-no , I believe I do n't .
Parsing [sent. 2962 len. 10]: I do n't seem to recall the name . ''
Parsing [sent. 2963 len. 58]: He waited a moment , pondering , with the door-knob in his hand , then started out ; but turned back and said that I had once been interested in Corrigan Castle , and asked me if I would go with him to his quarters in the evening and take a hot Scotch and talk it over .
Parsing [sent. 2964 len. 14]: I was a teetotaler and liked relaxation , so I said I would .
Parsing [sent. 2965 len. 10]: We drove from the lecture-hall together about half-past ten .
Parsing [sent. 2966 len. 40]: He had a most comfortably and tastefully furnished parlor , with good pictures on the walls , Indian and Japanese ornaments on the mantel , and here and there , and books everywhere-largely mine ; which made me proud .
Parsing [sent. 2967 len. 21]: The light was brilliant , the easy chairs were deep-cushioned , the arrangements for brewing and smoking were all there .
Parsing [sent. 2968 len. 25]: We brewed and lit up ; then he passed a sheet of note-paper to me and said -- `` Do you remember that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2969 len. 8]: `` Oh , yes , indeed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2970 len. 8]: The paper was of a sumptuous quality .
Parsing [sent. 2971 len. 54]: At the top was a twisted and interlaced monogram printed from steel dies in gold and blue and red , in the ornate English fashion of long years ago ; and under it , in neat gothic capitals was this -- printed in blue : THE MARK TWAIN CLUB CORRIGAN CASTLE ... ... .
Parsing [sent. 2972 len. 3]: .187 . .
Parsing [sent. 2973 len. 4]: `` My ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2974 len. 12]: said I , `` how did you come by this ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2975 len. 8]: `` I was President of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2976 len. 3]: `` No !
Parsing [sent. 2977 len. 8]: -- you do n't mean it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2978 len. 5]: `` It is true .
Parsing [sent. 2979 len. 6]: I was its first President .
Parsing [sent. 2980 len. 23]: I was re-elected annually as long as its meetings were held in my castle -- Corrigan -- which was five years . ''
Parsing [sent. 2981 len. 14]: Then he showed me an album with twenty-three photographs of me in it .
Parsing [sent. 2982 len. 30]: Five of them were of old dates , the others of various later crops ; the list closed with a picture taken by Falk in Sydney a month before .
Parsing [sent. 2983 len. 14]: `` You sent us the first five ; the rest were bought . ''
Parsing [sent. 2984 len. 4]: This was paradise !
Parsing [sent. 2985 len. 23]: We ran late , and talked , talked , talked -- subject , the Mark Twain Club of Corrigan Castle , Ireland .
Parsing [sent. 2986 len. 19]: My first knowledge of that Club dates away back ; all of twenty years , I should say .
Parsing [sent. 2987 len. 36]: It came to me in the form of a courteous letter , written on the note-paper which I have described , and signed `` By order of the President ; C. PEMBROKE , Secretary . ''
Parsing [sent. 2988 len. 32]: It conveyed the fact that the Club had been created in my honor , and added the hope that this token of appreciation of my work would meet with my approval .
Parsing [sent. 2989 len. 18]: I answered , with thanks ; and did what I could to keep my gratification from over-exposure .
Parsing [sent. 2990 len. 9]: It was then that the long correspondence began .
Parsing [sent. 2991 len. 21]: A letter came back , by order of the President , furnishing me the names of the members-thirty-two in number .
Parsing [sent. 2992 len. 19]: With it came a copy of the Constitution and By-Laws , in pamphlet form , and artistically printed .
Parsing [sent. 2993 len. 64]: The initiation fee and dues were in their proper place ; also , schedule of meetings -- monthly -- for essays upon works of mine , followed by discussions ; quarterly for business and a supper , without essays , but with after-supper speeches ; also there was a list of the officers : President , Vice-President , Secretary , Treasurer , etc. .
Parsing [sent. 2994 len. 32]: The letter was brief , but it was pleasant reading , for it told me about the strong interest which the membership took in their new venture , etc. , etc. .
Parsing [sent. 2995 len. 12]: It also asked me for a photograph -- a special one .
Parsing [sent. 2996 len. 18]: I went down and sat for it and sent it -- with a letter , of course .
Parsing [sent. 2997 len. 20]: Presently came the badge of the Club , and very dainty and pretty it was ; and very artistic .
Parsing [sent. 2998 len. 34]: It was a frog peeping out from a graceful tangle of grass-sprays and rushes , and was done in enamels on a gold basis , and had a gold pin back of it .
Parsing [sent. 2999 len. 66]: After I had petted it , and played with it , and caressed it , and enjoyed it a couple of hours , the light happened to fall upon it at a new angle , and revealed to me a cunning new detail ; with the light just right , certain delicate shadings of the grass-blades and rush-stems wove themselves into a monogram -- mine !
Parsing [sent. 3000 len. 12]: You can see that that jewel was a work of art .
Parsing [sent. 3001 len. 30]: And when you come to consider the intrinsic value of it , you must concede that it is not every literary club that could afford a badge like that .
Parsing [sent. 3002 len. 19]: It was easily worth $ 75 , in the opinion of Messrs. Marcus and Ward of New York .
Parsing [sent. 3003 len. 14]: They said they could not duplicate it for that and make a profit .
Parsing [sent. 3004 len. 25]: By this time the Club was well under way ; and from that time forth its secretary kept my off-hours well supplied with business .
Parsing [sent. 3005 len. 23]: He reported the Club 's discussions of my books with laborious fullness , and did his work with great spirit and ability .
Parsing [sent. 3006 len. 31]: As a , rule , he synopsized ; but when a speech was especially brilliant , he short-handed it and gave me the best passages from it , written out .
Parsing [sent. 3007 len. 23]: There were five speakers whom he particularly favored in that way : Palmer , Forbes , Naylor , Norris , and Calder .
Parsing [sent. 3008 len. 40]: Palmer and Forbes could never get through a speech without attacking each other , and each in his own way was formidably effective -- Palmer in virile and eloquent abuse , Forbes in courtly and elegant but scalding satire .
Parsing [sent. 3009 len. 15]: I could always tell which of them was talking without looking for his name .
Parsing [sent. 3010 len. 30]: Naylor had a polished style and a happy knack at felicitous metaphor ; Norris 's style was wholly without ornament , but enviably compact , lucid , and strong .
Parsing [sent. 3011 len. 9]: But after all , Calder was the gem .
Parsing [sent. 3012 len. 14]: He never spoke when sober , he spoke continuously when he was n't .
Parsing [sent. 3013 len. 13]: And certainly they were the drunkest speeches that a man ever uttered .
Parsing [sent. 3014 len. 25]: They were full of good things , but so incredibly mixed up and wandering that it made one 's head swim to follow him .
Parsing [sent. 3015 len. 29]: They were not intended to be funny , but they were , -- funny for the very gravity which the speaker put into his flowing miracles of incongruity .
Parsing [sent. 3016 len. 33]: In the course of five years I came to know the styles of the five orators as well as I knew the style of any speaker in my own club at home .
Parsing [sent. 3017 len. 6]: These reports came every month .
Parsing [sent. 3018 len. 37]: They were written on foolscap , 600 words to the page , and usually about twenty-five pages in a report -- a good 15,000 words , I should say , -- a solid week 's work .
Parsing [sent. 3019 len. 23]: The reports were absorbingly entertaining , long as they were ; but , unfortunately for me , they did not come alone .
Parsing [sent. 3020 len. 76]: They were always accompanied by a lot of questions about passages and purposes in my books , which the Club wanted answered ; and additionally accompanied every quarter by the Treasurer 's report , and the Auditor 's report , and the Committee 's report , and the President 's review , and my opinion of these was always desired ; also suggestions for the good of the Club , if any occurred to me .
Parsing [sent. 3021 len. 31]: By and by I came to dread those things ; and this dread grew and grew and grew ; grew until I got to anticipating them with a cold horror .
Parsing [sent. 3022 len. 54]: For I was an indolent man , and not fond of letter-writing , and whenever these things came I had to put everything by and sit down -- for my own peace of mind -- and dig and dig until I got something out of my head which would answer for a reply .
Parsing [sent. 3023 len. 37]: I got along fairly well the first year ; but for the succeeding four years the Mark Twain Club of Corrigan Castle was my curse , my nightmare , the grief and misery of my life .
Parsing [sent. 3024 len. 12]: And I got so , so sick of sitting for photographs .
Parsing [sent. 3025 len. 15]: I sat every year for five years , trying to satisfy that insatiable organization .
Parsing [sent. 3026 len. 8]: Then at last I rose in revolt .
Parsing [sent. 3027 len. 8]: I could endure my oppressions no longer .
Parsing [sent. 3028 len. 21]: I pulled my fortitude together and tore off my chains , and was a free man again , and happy .
Parsing [sent. 3029 len. 24]: From that day I burned the secretary 's fat envelopes the moment they arrived , and by and by they ceased to come .
Parsing [sent. 3030 len. 20]: Well , in the sociable frankness of that night in Bendigo I brought this all out in full confession .
Parsing [sent. 3031 len. 37]: Then Mr. Blank came out in the same frank way , and with a preliminary word of gentle apology said that he was the Mark Twain Club , and the only member it had ever had !
Parsing [sent. 3032 len. 15]: Why , it was matter for anger , but I did n't feel any .
Parsing [sent. 3033 len. 30]: He said he never had to work for a living , and that by the time he was thirty life had become a bore and a weariness to him .
Parsing [sent. 3034 len. 21]: He had no interests left ; they had paled and perished , one by one , and left him desolate .
Parsing [sent. 3035 len. 8]: He had begun to think of suicide .
Parsing [sent. 3036 len. 30]: Then all of a sudden he thought of that happy idea of starting an imaginary club , and went straightway to work at it , with enthusiasm and love .
Parsing [sent. 3037 len. 13]: He was charmed with it ; it gave him something to do .
Parsing [sent. 3038 len. 25]: It elaborated itself on his hands ; -- it became twenty times more complex and formidable than was his first rude draft of it .
Parsing [sent. 3039 len. 23]: Every new addition to his original plan which cropped up in his mind gave him a fresh interest and a new pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 3040 len. 33]: He designed the Club badge himself , and worked over it , altering and improving it , a number of days and nights ; then sent to London and had it made .
Parsing [sent. 3041 len. 9]: It was the only one that was made .
Parsing [sent. 3042 len. 16]: It was made for me ; the `` rest of the Club '' went without .
Parsing [sent. 3043 len. 9]: He invented the thirty-two members and their names .
Parsing [sent. 3044 len. 12]: He invented the five favorite speakers and their five separate styles .
Parsing [sent. 3045 len. 10]: He invented their speeches , and reported them himself .
Parsing [sent. 3046 len. 19]: He would have kept that Club going until now , if I had n't deserted , he said .
Parsing [sent. 3047 len. 41]: He said he worked like a slave over those reports ; each of them cost him from a week to a fortnight 's work , and the work gave him pleasure and kept him alive and willing to be alive .
Parsing [sent. 3048 len. 12]: It was a bitter blow to him when the Club died .
Parsing [sent. 3049 len. 9]: Finally , there was n't any Corrigan Castle .
Parsing [sent. 3050 len. 7]: He had invented that , too .
Parsing [sent. 3051 len. 27]: It was wonderful -- the whole thing ; and altogether the most ingenious and laborious and cheerful and painstaking practical joke I have ever heard of .
Parsing [sent. 3052 len. 31]: And I liked it ; liked to hear him tell about it ; yet I have been a hater of practical jokes from as long back as I can remember .
Parsing [sent. 3053 len. 34]: Finally he said -- `` Do you remember a note from Melbourne fourteen or fifteen years ago , telling about your lecture tour in Australia , and your death and burial in Melbourne ?
Parsing [sent. 3054 len. 17]: -- a note from Henry Bascomb , of Bascomb Hall , Upper Holywell , Hants . ''
Parsing [sent. 3055 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 3056 len. 6]: `` I wrote it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3057 len. 4]: `` M-y-word ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3058 len. 7]: `` Yes , I did it .
Parsing [sent. 3059 len. 6]: I do n't know why .
Parsing [sent. 3060 len. 15]: I just took the notion , and carried it out without stopping to think .
Parsing [sent. 3061 len. 4]: It was wrong .
Parsing [sent. 3062 len. 6]: It could have done harm .
Parsing [sent. 3063 len. 8]: I was always sorry about it afterward .
Parsing [sent. 3064 len. 5]: You must forgive me .
Parsing [sent. 3065 len. 17]: I was Mr. Bascom 's guest on his yacht , on his voyage around the world .
Parsing [sent. 3066 len. 41]: He often spoke of you , and of the pleasant times you had had together in his home ; and the notion took me , there in Melbourne , and I imitated his hand , and wrote the letter . ''
Parsing [sent. 3067 len. 14]: So the mystery was cleared up , after so many , many years .
Parsing [sent. 3068 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXVI .
Parsing [sent. 3069 len. 14]: There are people who can do all fine and heroic things but one !
Parsing [sent. 3070 len. 9]: keep from telling their happinesses to the unhappy .
Parsing [sent. 3071 len. 9]: -- Pudd ` nhead Wilson 's New Calendar .
Parsing [sent. 3072 len. 18]: After visits to Maryborough and some other Australian towns , we presently took passage for New Zealand .
Parsing [sent. 3073 len. 33]: If it would not look too much like showing off , I would tell the reader where New Zealand is ; for he is as I was ; he thinks he knows .
Parsing [sent. 3074 len. 32]: And he thinks he knows where Hertzegovina is ; and how to pronounce pariah ; and how to use the word unique without exposing himself to the derision of the dictionary .
Parsing [sent. 3075 len. 11]: But in truth , he knows none of these things .
Parsing [sent. 3076 len. 24]: There are but four or five people in the world who possess this knowledge , and these make their living out of it .
Parsing [sent. 3077 len. 32]: They travel from place to place , visiting literary assemblages , geographical societies , and seats of learning , and springing sudden bets that these people do not know these things .
Parsing [sent. 3078 len. 17]: Since all people think they know them , they are an easy prey to these adventurers .
Parsing [sent. 3079 len. 57]: Or rather they were an easy prey until the law interfered , three months ago , and a New York court decided that this kind of gambling is illegal , `` because it traverses Article IV , Section 9 , of the Constitution of the United States , which forbids betting on a sure thing . ''
Parsing [sent. 3080 len. 46]: This decision was rendered by the full Bench of the New York Supreme Court , after a test sprung upon the court by counsel for the prosecution , which showed that none of the nine Judges was able to answer any of the four questions .
Parsing [sent. 3081 len. 26]: All people think that New Zealand is close to Australia or Asia , or somewhere , and that you cross to it on a bridge .
Parsing [sent. 3082 len. 6]: But that is not so .
Parsing [sent. 3083 len. 17]: It is not close to anything , but lies by itself , out in the water .
Parsing [sent. 3084 len. 11]: It is nearest to Australia , but still not near .
Parsing [sent. 3085 len. 7]: The gap between is very wide .
Parsing [sent. 3086 len. 40]: It will be a surprise to the reader , as it was to me , to learn that the distance from Australia to New Zealand is really twelve or thirteen hundred miles , and that there is no bridge .
Parsing [sent. 3087 len. 33]: I learned this from Professor X. , of Yale University , whom I met in the steamer on the great lakes when I was crossing the continent to sail across the Pacific .
Parsing [sent. 3088 len. 13]: I asked him about New Zealand , in order to make conversation .
Parsing [sent. 3089 len. 54]: I supposed he would generalize a little without compromising himself , and then turn the subject to something he was acquainted with , and my object would then be attained ; the ice would be broken , and we could go smoothly on , and get acquainted , and have a pleasant time .
Parsing [sent. 3090 len. 31]: But , to my surprise , he was not only not embarrassed by my question , but seemed to welcome it , and to take a distinct interest in it .
Parsing [sent. 3091 len. 76]: He began to talk -- fluently , confidently , comfortably ; and as he talked , my admiration grew and grew ; for as the subject developed under his hands , I saw that he not only knew where New Zealand was , but that he was minutely familiar with every detail of its history , politics , religions , and commerce , its fauna , flora , geology , products , and climatic peculiarities .
Parsing [sent. 3092 len. 32]: When he was done , I was lost in wonder and admiration , and said to myself , he knows everything ; in the domain of human knowledge he is king .
Parsing [sent. 3093 len. 33]: I wanted to see him do more miracles ; and so , just for the pleasure of hearing him answer , I asked him about Hertzegovina , and pariah , and unique .
Parsing [sent. 3094 len. 11]: But he began to generalize then , and show distress .
Parsing [sent. 3095 len. 23]: I saw that with New Zealand gone , he was a Samson shorn of his locks ; he was as other men .
Parsing [sent. 3096 len. 22]: This was a curious and interesting mystery , and I was frank with him , and asked him to explain it .
Parsing [sent. 3097 len. 33]: He tried to avoid it at first ; but then laughed and said that after all , the matter was not worth concealment , so he would let me into the secret .
Parsing [sent. 3098 len. 32]: In substance , this is his story : `` Last autumn I was at work one morning at home , when a card came up -- the card of a stranger .
Parsing [sent. 3099 len. 24]: Under the name was printed a line which showed that this visitor was Professor of Theological Engineering in Wellington University , New Zealand .
Parsing [sent. 3100 len. 16]: I was troubled -- troubled , I mean , by the shortness of the notice .
Parsing [sent. 3101 len. 34]: College etiquette required that he be at once invited to dinner by some member of the Faculty -- invited to dine on that day -- not , put off till a subsequent day .
Parsing [sent. 3102 len. 9]: I did not quite know what to do .
Parsing [sent. 3103 len. 69]: College etiquette requires , in the case of a foreign guest , that the dinner-talk shall begin with complimentary references to his country , its great men , its services to civilization , its seats of learning , and things like that ; and of course the host is responsible , and must either begin this talk himself or see that it is done by some one else .
Parsing [sent. 3104 len. 20]: I was in great difficulty ; and the more I searched my memory , the more my trouble grew .
Parsing [sent. 3105 len. 10]: I found that I knew nothing about New Zealand .
Parsing [sent. 3106 len. 13]: I thought I knew where it was , and that was all .
Parsing [sent. 3107 len. 28]: I had an impression that it was close to Australia , or Asia , or somewhere , and that one went over to it on a bridge .
Parsing [sent. 3108 len. 77]: This might turn out to be incorrect ; and even if correct , it would not furnish matter enough for the purpose at the dinner , and I should expose my College to shame before my guest ; he would see that I , a member of the Faculty of the first University in America , was wholly ignorant of his country , and he would go away and tell this , and laugh at it .
Parsing [sent. 3109 len. 9]: The thought of it made my face burn .
Parsing [sent. 3110 len. 43]: `` I sent for my wife and told her how I was situated , and asked for her help , and she thought of a thing which I might have thought of myself , if I had not been excited and worried .
Parsing [sent. 3111 len. 49]: She said she would go and tell the visitor that I was out but would be in in a few minutes ; and she would talk , and keep him busy while I got out the back way and hurried over and make Professor Lawson give the dinner .
Parsing [sent. 3112 len. 22]: For Lawson knew everything , and could meet the guest in a creditable way and save the reputation of the University .
Parsing [sent. 3113 len. 9]: I ran to Lawson , but was disappointed .
Parsing [sent. 3114 len. 9]: He did not know anything about New Zealand .
Parsing [sent. 3115 len. 39]: He said that , as far as his recollection went it was close to Australia , or Asia , or somewhere , and you go over to it on a bridge ; but that was all he knew .
Parsing [sent. 3116 len. 5]: It was too bad .
Parsing [sent. 3117 len. 30]: Lawson was a perfect encyclopedia of abstruse learning ; but now in this hour of our need , it turned out that he did not know any useful thing .
Parsing [sent. 3118 len. 4]: `` We consulted .
Parsing [sent. 3119 len. 36]: He saw that the reputation of the University was in very real peril , and he walked the floor in anxiety , talking , and trying to think out some way to meet the difficulty .
Parsing [sent. 3120 len. 22]: Presently he decided that we must try the rest of the Faculty -- some of them might know about New Zealand .
Parsing [sent. 3121 len. 76]: So we went to the telephone and called up the professor of astronomy and asked him , and he said that all he knew was , that it was close to Australia , or Asia , or somewhere , and you went over to it on -- `` We shut him off and called up the professor of biology , and he said that all he knew was that it was close to Aus -- .
Parsing [sent. 3122 len. 25]: `` We shut him off , and sat down , worried and disheartened , to see if we could think up some other scheme .
Parsing [sent. 3123 len. 23]: We shortly hit upon one which promised well , and this one we adopted , and set its machinery going at once .
Parsing [sent. 3124 len. 4]: It was this .
Parsing [sent. 3125 len. 6]: Lawson must give the dinner .
Parsing [sent. 3126 len. 10]: The Faculty must be notified by telephone to prepare .
Parsing [sent. 3127 len. 41]: We must all get to work diligently , and at the end of eight hours and a half we must come to dinner acquainted with New Zealand ; at least well enough informed to appear without discredit before this native .
Parsing [sent. 3128 len. 99]: To seem properly intelligent we should have to know about New Zealand 's population , and politics , and form of government , and commerce , and taxes , and products , and ancient history , and modern history , and varieties of religion , and nature of the laws , and their codification , and amount of revenue , and whence drawn , and methods of collection , and percentage of loss , and character of climate , and -- well , a lot of things like that ; we must suck the maps and cyclopedias dry .
Parsing [sent. 3129 len. 51]: And while we posted up in this way , the Faculty 's wives must flock over , one after the other , in a studiedly casual way , and help my wife keep the New Zealander quiet , and not let him get out and come interfering with our studies .
Parsing [sent. 3130 len. 14]: The scheme worked admirably ; but it stopped business , stopped it entirely .
Parsing [sent. 3131 len. 103]: `` It is in the official log-book of Yale , to be read and wondered at by future generations -- the account of the Great Blank Day -- the memorable Blank Day -- the day wherein the wheels of culture were stopped , a Sunday silence prevailed all about , and the whole University stood still while the Faculty read-up and qualified itself to sit at meat , without shame , in the presence of the Professor of Theological Engineering from New Zealand : `` When we assembled at the dinner we were miserably tired and worn -- but we were posted .
Parsing [sent. 3132 len. 9]: Yes , it is fair to claim that .
Parsing [sent. 3133 len. 11]: In fact , erudition is a pale name for it .
Parsing [sent. 3134 len. 19]: New Zealand was the only subject ; and it was just beautiful to hear us ripple it out .
Parsing [sent. 3135 len. 32]: And with such an air of unembarrassed ease , and unostentatious familiarity with detail , and trained and seasoned mastery of the subject-and oh , the grace and fluency of it !
Parsing [sent. 3136 len. 21]: `` Well , finally somebody happened to notice that the guest was looking dazed , and was n't saying anything .
Parsing [sent. 3137 len. 9]: So they stirred him up , of course .
Parsing [sent. 3138 len. 19]: Then that man came out with a good , honest , eloquent compliment that made the Faculty blush .
Parsing [sent. 3139 len. 42]: He said he was not worthy to sit in the company of men like these ; that he had been silent from admiration ; that he had been silent from another cause also -- silent from shame -- silent from ignorance !
Parsing [sent. 3140 len. 47]: ` For , ' said he , ` I , who have lived eighteen years in New Zealand and have served five in a professorship , and ought to know much about that country , perceive , now , that I know almost nothing about it .
Parsing [sent. 3141 len. 42]: I say it with shame , that I have learned fifty times , yes , a hundred times more about New Zealand in these two hours at this table than I ever knew before in all the eighteen years put together .
Parsing [sent. 3142 len. 10]: I was silent because I could not help myself .
Parsing [sent. 3143 len. 69]: What I knew about taxes , and policies , and laws , and revenue , and products , and history , and all that multitude of things , was but general , and ordinary , and vague-unscientific , in a word -- and it would have been insanity to expose it here to the searching glare of your amazingly accurate and all-comprehensive knowledge of those matters , gentlemen .
Parsing [sent. 3144 len. 13]: I beg you to let me sit silent -- as becomes me .
Parsing [sent. 3145 len. 43]: But do not change the subject ; I can at least follow you , in this one ; whereas if you change to one which shall call out the full strength of your mighty erudition , I shall be as one lost .
Parsing [sent. 3146 len. 29]: If you know all this about a remote little inconsequent patch like New Zealand , ah , what would n't you know about any other Subject ! ' ''
Parsing [sent. 3147 len. 10]: CHAPTER XXVII Man is the Only Animal that Blushes .
Parsing [sent. 3148 len. 4]: Or needs to .
Parsing [sent. 3149 len. 9]: -- Pudd ` nhead Wilson 's New Calendar .
Parsing [sent. 3150 len. 17]: The universal brotherhood of man is our most precious possession , what there is of it .
Parsing [sent. 3151 len. 9]: -- Pudd ` nhead Wilson 's New Calendar .
Parsing [sent. 3152 len. 8]: FROM DIARY : November 1 -- noon .
Parsing [sent. 3153 len. 8]: A fine day , a brilliant sun .
Parsing [sent. 3154 len. 19]: Warm in the sun , cold in the shade -- an icy breeze blowing out of the south .
Parsing [sent. 3155 len. 8]: A solemn long swell rolling up northward .
Parsing [sent. 3156 len. 22]: It comes from the South Pole , with nothing in the way to obstruct its march and tone its energy down .
Parsing [sent. 3157 len. 15]: I have read somewhere that an acute observer among the early explorers -- Cook ?
Parsing [sent. 3158 len. 3]: or Tasman ?
Parsing [sent. 3159 len. 41]: -- accepted this majestic swell as trustworthy circumstantial evidence that no important land lay to the southward , and so did not waste time on a useless quest in that direction , but changed his course and went searching elsewhere .
Parsing [sent. 3160 len. 2]: Afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 3161 len. 37]: Passing between Tasmania -LRB- formerly Van Diemen 's Land -RRB- and neighboring islands -- islands whence the poor exiled Tasmanian savages used to gaze at their lost homeland and cry ; and die of broken hearts .
Parsing [sent. 3162 len. 18]: How glad I am that all these native races are dead and gone , or nearly so .
Parsing [sent. 3163 len. 13]: The work was mercifully swift and horrible in some portions of Australia .
Parsing [sent. 3164 len. 18]: As far as Tasmania is concerned , the extermination was complete : not a native is left .
Parsing [sent. 3165 len. 12]: It was a strife of years , and decades of years .
Parsing [sent. 3166 len. 17]: The Whites and the Blacks hunted each other , ambushed each other , butchered each other .
Parsing [sent. 3167 len. 6]: The Blacks were not numerous .
Parsing [sent. 3168 len. 16]: But they were wary , alert , cunning , and they knew their country well .
Parsing [sent. 3169 len. 19]: They lasted a long time , few as they were , and inflicted much slaughter upon the Whites .
Parsing [sent. 3170 len. 14]: The Government wanted to save the Blacks from ultimate extermination , if possible .
Parsing [sent. 3171 len. 21]: One of its schemes was to capture them and coop them up , on a neighboring island , under guard .
Parsing [sent. 3172 len. 31]: Bodies of Whites volunteered for the hunt , for the pay was good -- L5 for each Black captured and delivered , but the success achieved was not very satisfactory .
Parsing [sent. 3173 len. 11]: The Black was naked , and his body was greased .
Parsing [sent. 3174 len. 13]: It was hard to get a grip on him that would hold .
Parsing [sent. 3175 len. 47]: The Whites moved about in armed bodies , and surprised little families of natives , and did make captures ; but it was suspected that in these surprises half a dozen natives were killed to one caught -- and that was not what the Government desired .
Parsing [sent. 3176 len. 46]: Another scheme was to drive the natives into a corner of the island and fence them in by a cordon of men placed in line across the country ; but the natives managed to slip through , constantly , and continue their murders and arsons .
Parsing [sent. 3177 len. 22]: The governor warned these unlettered savages by printed proclamation that they must stay in the desolate region officially appointed for them !
Parsing [sent. 3178 len. 14]: The proclamation was a dead letter ; the savages could not read it .
Parsing [sent. 3179 len. 6]: Afterward a picture-proclamation was issued .
Parsing [sent. 3180 len. 17]: It was painted up on boards , and these were nailed to trees in the forest .
Parsing [sent. 3181 len. 9]: Herewith is a photographic reproduction of this fashion-plate .
Parsing [sent. 3182 len. 6]: Substantially it means : 1 .
Parsing [sent. 3183 len. 15]: The Governor wishes the Whites and the Blacks to love each other ; 2 .
Parsing [sent. 3184 len. 8]: He loves his black subjects ; 3 .
Parsing [sent. 3185 len. 10]: Blacks who kill Whites will be hanged ; 4 .
Parsing [sent. 3186 len. 8]: Whites who kill Blacks will be hanged .
Parsing [sent. 3187 len. 29]: Upon its several schemes the Government spent L30 ,000 and employed the labors and ingenuities of several thousand Whites for a long time with failure as a result .
Parsing [sent. 3188 len. 27]: Then , at last , a quarter of a century after the beginning of the troubles between the two races , the right man was found .
Parsing [sent. 3189 len. 6]: No , he found himself .
Parsing [sent. 3190 len. 14]: This was George Augustus Robinson , called in history `` The Conciliator . ''
Parsing [sent. 3191 len. 12]: He was not educated , and not conspicuous in any way .
Parsing [sent. 3192 len. 10]: He was a working bricklayer , in Hobart Town .
Parsing [sent. 3193 len. 17]: But he must have been an amazing personality ; a man worth traveling far to see .
Parsing [sent. 3194 len. 20]: It may be his counterpart appears in history , but I do not know where to look for it .
Parsing [sent. 3195 len. 93]: He set himself this incredible task : to go out into the wilderness , the jungle , and the mountain-retreats where the hunted and implacable savages were hidden , and appear among them unarmed , speak the language of love and of kindness to them , and persuade them to forsake their homes and the wild free life that was so dear to them , and go with him and surrender to the hated Whites and live under their watch and ward , and upon their charity the rest of their lives !
Parsing [sent. 3196 len. 11]: On its face it was the dream of a madman .
Parsing [sent. 3197 len. 15]: In the beginning , his moral-suasion project was sarcastically dubbed the sugar plum speculation .
Parsing [sent. 3198 len. 21]: If the scheme was striking , and new to the world 's experience , the situation was not less so .
Parsing [sent. 3199 len. 4]: It was this .
Parsing [sent. 3200 len. 15]: The White population numbered 40,000 in 1831 ; the Black population numbered three hundred .
Parsing [sent. 3201 len. 13]: Not 300 warriors , but 300 men , women , and children .
Parsing [sent. 3202 len. 14]: The Whites were armed with guns , the Blacks with clubs and spears .
Parsing [sent. 3203 len. 34]: The Whites had fought the Blacks for a quarter of a century , and had tried every thinkable way to capture , kill , or subdue them ; and could not do it .
Parsing [sent. 3204 len. 17]: If white men of any race could have done it , these would have accomplished it .
Parsing [sent. 3205 len. 20]: But every scheme had failed , the splendid 300 , the matchless 300 were unconquered , and manifestly unconquerable .
Parsing [sent. 3206 len. 20]: They would not yield , they would listen to no terms , they would fight to the bitter end .
Parsing [sent. 3207 len. 20]: Yet they had no poet to keep up their heart , and sing the marvel of their magnificent patriotism .
Parsing [sent. 3208 len. 47]: At the end of five-and-twenty years of hard fighting , the surviving 300 naked patriots were still defiant , still persistent , still efficacious with their rude weapons , and the Gove7rnor and the 40,000 knew not which way to turn , nor what to do .
Parsing [sent. 3209 len. 53]: Then the Bricklayer -- that wonderful man -- proposed to go out into the wilderness , with no weapon but his tongue , and no protection but his honest eye and his humane heart ; and track those embittered savages to their lairs in the gloomy forests and among the mountain snows .
Parsing [sent. 3210 len. 8]: Naturally , he was considered a crank .
Parsing [sent. 3211 len. 7]: But he was not quite that .
Parsing [sent. 3212 len. 12]: In fact , he was a good way short of that .
Parsing [sent. 3213 len. 14]: He was building upon his long and intimate knowledge of the native character .
Parsing [sent. 3214 len. 42]: The deriders of his project were right -- from their standpoint -- for they believed the natives to be mere wild beasts ; and Robinson was right , from his standpoint -- for he believed the natives to be human beings .
Parsing [sent. 3215 len. 9]: The truth did really lie between the two .
Parsing [sent. 3216 len. 43]: The event proved that Robinson 's judgment was soundest ; but about once a month for four years the event came near to giving the verdict to the deriders , for about that frequently Robinson barely escaped falling under the native spears .
Parsing [sent. 3217 len. 18]: But history shows that he had a thinking head , and was not a mere wild sentimentalist .
Parsing [sent. 3218 len. 20]: For instance , he wanted the war parties called in before he started unarmed upon his mission of peace .
Parsing [sent. 3219 len. 12]: He wanted the best chance of success -- not a half-chance .
Parsing [sent. 3220 len. 26]: And he was very willing to have help ; and so , high rewards were advertised , for any who would go unarmed with him .
Parsing [sent. 3221 len. 5]: This opportunity was declined .
Parsing [sent. 3222 len. 34]: Robinson persuaded some tamed natives of both sexes to go with him -- a strong evidence of his persuasive powers , for those natives well knew that their destruction would be almost certain .
Parsing [sent. 3223 len. 15]: As it turned out , they had to face death over and over again .
Parsing [sent. 3224 len. 13]: Robinson and his little party had a difficult undertaking upon their hands .
Parsing [sent. 3225 len. 84]: They could not ride off , horseback , comfortably into the woods and call Leonidas and his 300 together for a talk and a treaty the following day ; for the wild men were not in a body ; they were scattered , immense distances apart , over regions so desolate that even the birds could not make a living with the chances offered -- scattered in groups of twenty , a dozen , half a dozen , even in groups of three .
Parsing [sent. 3226 len. 8]: And the mission must go on foot .
Parsing [sent. 3227 len. 94]: Mr. Bonwick furnishes a description of those horrible regions , whereby it will be seen that even fugitive gangs of the hardiest and choicest human devils the world has seen -- the convicts set apart to people the `` Hell of Macquarrie Harbor Station '' -- were never able , but once , to survive the horrors of a march through them , but starving and struggling , and fainting and failing , ate each other , and died : `` Onward , still onward , was the order of the indomitable Robinson .
Parsing [sent. 3228 len. 19]: No one ignorant of the western country of Tasmania can form a correct idea of the traveling difficulties .
Parsing [sent. 3229 len. 31]: While I was resident in Hobart Town , the Governor , Sir John Franklin , and his lady , undertook the western journey to Macquarrie Harbor , and suffered terribly .
Parsing [sent. 3230 len. 21]: One man who assisted to carry her ladyship through the swamps , gave me his bitter experience of its miseries .
Parsing [sent. 3231 len. 6]: Several were disabled for life .
Parsing [sent. 3232 len. 22]: No wonder that but one party , escaping from Macquarrie Harbor convict settlement , arrived at the civilized region in safety .
Parsing [sent. 3233 len. 18]: Men perished in the scrub , were lost in snow , or were devoured by their companions .
Parsing [sent. 3234 len. 13]: This was the territory traversed by Mr. Robinson and his Black guides .
Parsing [sent. 3235 len. 11]: All honor to his intrepidity , and their wonderful fidelity !
Parsing [sent. 3236 len. 46]: When they had , in the depth of winter , to cross deep and rapid rivers , pass among mountains six thousand feet high , pierce dangerous thickets , and find food in a country forsaken even by birds , we can realize their hardships .
Parsing [sent. 3237 len. 38]: `` After a frightful journey by Cradle Mountain , and over the lofty plateau of Middlesex Plains , the travelers experienced unwonted misery , and the circumstances called forth the best qualities of the noble little band .
Parsing [sent. 3238 len. 16]: Mr. Robinson wrote afterwards to Mr. Secretary Burnett some details of this passage of horrors .
Parsing [sent. 3239 len. 67]: In that letter , of Oct 2 , 1834 , he states that his Natives were very reluctant to go over the dreadful mountain passes ; that ` for seven successive days we continued traveling over one solid body of snow ; ' that ` the snows were of incredible depth ; ' that ` the Natives were frequently up to their middle in snow . '
Parsing [sent. 3240 len. 34]: But still the ill-clad , ill-fed , diseased , and way-worn men and women were sustained by the cheerful voice of their unconquerable friend , and responded most nobly to his call . ''
Parsing [sent. 3241 len. 41]: Mr. Bonwick says that Robinson 's friendly capture of the Big River tribe remember , it was a whole tribe -- `` was by far the grandest feature of the war , and the crowning glory of his efforts . ''
Parsing [sent. 3242 len. 14]: The word `` war '' was not well chosen , and is misleading .
Parsing [sent. 3243 len. 28]: There was war still , but only the Blacks were conducting it -- the Whites were holding off until Robinson could give his scheme a fair trial .
Parsing [sent. 3244 len. 68]: I think that we are to understand that the friendly capture of that tribe was by far the most important thing , the highest in value , that happened during the whole thirty years of truceless hostilities ; that it was a decisive thing , a peaceful Waterloo , the surrender of the native Napoleon and his dreaded forces , the happy ending of the long strife .
Parsing [sent. 3245 len. 23]: For `` that tribe was the terror of the colony , '' its chief `` the Black Douglas of Bush households . ''
Parsing [sent. 3246 len. 38]: Robinson knew that these formidable people were lurking somewhere , in some remote corner of the hideous regions just described , and he and his unarmed little party started on a tedious and perilous hunt for them .
Parsing [sent. 3247 len. 33]: At last , `` there , under the shadows of the Frenchman 's Cap , whose grim cone rose five thousand feet in the uninhabited westward interior , '' they were found .
Parsing [sent. 3248 len. 6]: It was a serious moment .
Parsing [sent. 3249 len. 30]: Robinson himself believed , for once , that his mission , successful until now , was to end here in failure , and that his own death-hour had struck .
Parsing [sent. 3250 len. 37]: The redoubtable chief stood in menacing attitude , with his eighteen-foot spear poised ; his warriors stood massed at his back , armed for battle , their faces eloquent with their long-cherished loathing for white men .
Parsing [sent. 3251 len. 11]: `` They rattled their spears and shouted their war-cry . ''
Parsing [sent. 3252 len. 31]: Their women were back of them , laden with supplies of weapons , and keeping their 150 eager dogs quiet until the chief should give the signal to fall on .
Parsing [sent. 3253 len. 21]: `` I think we shall soon be in the resurrection , '' whispered a member of Robinson 's little party .
Parsing [sent. 3254 len. 33]: `` I think we shall , '' answered Robinson ; then plucked up heart and began his persuasions -- in the tribe 's own dialect , which surprised and pleased the chief .
Parsing [sent. 3255 len. 15]: Presently there was an interruption by the chief : `` Who are you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3256 len. 6]: `` We are gentlemen . ''
Parsing [sent. 3257 len. 7]: `` Where are your guns ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3258 len. 6]: `` We have none . ''
Parsing [sent. 3259 len. 5]: The warrior was astonished .
Parsing [sent. 3260 len. 7]: `` Where your little guns ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3261 len. 4]: -LRB- pistols -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 3262 len. 6]: `` We have none . ''
Parsing [sent. 3263 len. 32]: A few minutes passed -- in by-play -- suspense -- discussion among the tribesmen -- Robinson 's tamed squaws ventured to cross the line and begin persuasions upon the wild squaws .
Parsing [sent. 3264 len. 21]: Then the chief stepped back `` to confer with the old women -- the real arbiters of savage war . ''
Parsing [sent. 3265 len. 39]: Mr. Bonwick continues : `` As the fallen gladiator in the arena looks for the signal of life or death from the president of the amphitheatre , so waited our friends in anxious suspense while the conference continued .
Parsing [sent. 3266 len. 23]: In a few minutes , before a word was uttered , the women of the tribe threw up their arms three times .
Parsing [sent. 3267 len. 8]: This was the inviolable sign of peace !
Parsing [sent. 3268 len. 5]: Down fell the spears .
Parsing [sent. 3269 len. 21]: Forward , with a heavy sigh of relief , and upward glance of gratitude , came the friends of peace .
Parsing [sent. 3270 len. 25]: The impulsive natives rushed forth with tears and cries , as each saw in the other 's rank a loved one of the past .
Parsing [sent. 3271 len. 8]: `` It was a jubilee of joy .
Parsing [sent. 3272 len. 4]: A festival followed .
Parsing [sent. 3273 len. 22]: And , while tears flowed at the recital of woe , a corrobory of pleasant laughter closed the eventful day . ''
Parsing [sent. 3274 len. 54]: In four years , without the spilling of a drop of blood , Robinson brought them all in , willing captives , and delivered them to the white governor , and ended the war which powder and bullets , and thousands of men to use them , had prosecuted without result since 1804 .
Parsing [sent. 3275 len. 22]: Marsyas charming the wild beasts with his music -- that is fable ; but the miracle wrought by Robinson is fact .
Parsing [sent. 3276 len. 29]: It is history -- and authentic ; and surely , there is nothing greater , nothing more reverence-compelling in the history of any country , ancient or modern .
Parsing [sent. 3277 len. 42]: And in memory of the greatest man Australasia ever developed or ever will develop , there is a stately monument to George Augustus Robinson , the Conciliator in -- no , it is to another man , I forget his name .
Parsing [sent. 3278 len. 16]: However , Robertson 's own generation honored him , and in manifesting it honored themselves .
Parsing [sent. 3279 len. 32]: The Government gave him a money-reward and a thousand acres of land ; and the people held mass-meetings and praised him and emphasized their praise with a large subscription of money .
Parsing [sent. 3280 len. 64]: A good dramatic situation ; but the curtain fell on another : `` When this desperate tribe was thus captured , there was much surprise to find that the L30 ,000 of a little earlier day had been spent , and the whole population of the colony placed under arms , in contention with an opposing force of sixteen men with wooden spears !
Parsing [sent. 3281 len. 6]: Yet such was the fact .
Parsing [sent. 3282 len. 29]: The celebrated Big River tribe , that had been raised by European fears to a host , consisted of sixteen men , nine women , and one child .
Parsing [sent. 3283 len. 34]: With a knowledge of the mischief done by these few , their wonderful marches and their widespread aggressions , their enemies can not deny to them the attributes of courage and military tact .
Parsing [sent. 3284 len. 27]: A Wallace might harass a large army with a small and determined band ; but the contending parties were at least equal in arms and civilization .
Parsing [sent. 3285 len. 45]: The Zulus who fought us in Africa , the Maories in New Zealand , the Arabs in the Soudan , were far better provided with weapons , more advanced in the science of war , and considerably more numerous , than the naked Tasmanians .
Parsing [sent. 3286 len. 10]: Governor Arthur rightly termed them a noble race . ''
Parsing [sent. 3287 len. 9]: These were indeed wonderful people , the natives .
Parsing [sent. 3288 len. 8]: They ought not to have been wasted .
Parsing [sent. 3289 len. 9]: They should have been crossed with the Whites .
Parsing [sent. 3290 len. 13]: It would have improved the Whites and done the Natives no harm .
Parsing [sent. 3291 len. 11]: But the Natives were wasted , poor heroic wild creatures .
Parsing [sent. 3292 len. 46]: They were gathered together in little settlements on neighboring islands , and paternally cared for by the Government , and instructed in religion , and deprived of tobacco , because the superintendent of the Sunday-school was not a smoker , and so considered smoking immoral .
Parsing [sent. 3293 len. 48]: The Natives were not used to clothes , and houses , and regular hours , and church , and school , and Sunday-school , and work , and the other misplaced persecutions of civilization , and they pined for their lost home and their wild free life .
Parsing [sent. 3294 len. 14]: Too late they repented that they had traded that heaven for this hell .
Parsing [sent. 3295 len. 48]: They sat homesick on their alien crags , and day by day gazed out through their tears over the sea with unappeasable longing toward the hazy bulk which was the specter of what had been their paradise ; one by one their hearts broke and they died .
Parsing [sent. 3296 len. 13]: In a very few years nothing but a scant remnant remained alive .
Parsing [sent. 3297 len. 7]: A handful lingered along into age .
Parsing [sent. 3298 len. 22]: In 1864 the last man died , in 1876 the last woman died , and the Spartans of Australasia were extinct .
Parsing [sent. 3299 len. 51]: The Whites always mean well when they take human fish out of the ocean and try to make them dry and warm and happy and comfortable in a chicken coop ; but the kindest-hearted white man can always be depended on to prove himself inadequate when he deals with savages .
Parsing [sent. 3300 len. 88]: He can not turn the situation around and imagine how he would like it to have a well-meaning savage transfer him from his house and his church and his clothes and his books and his choice food to a hideous wilderness of sand and rocks and snow , and ice and sleet and storm and blistering sun , with no shelter , no bed , no covering for his and his family 's naked bodies , and nothing to eat but snakes and grubs and ` offal .
Parsing [sent. 3301 len. 99]: This would be a hell to him ; and if he had any wisdom he would know that his own civilization is a hell to the savage -- but he has n't any , and has never had any ; and for lack of it he shut up those poor natives in the unimaginable perdition of his civilization , committing his crime with the very best intentions , and saw those poor creatures waste away under his tortures ; and gazed at it , vaguely troubled and sorrowful , and wondered what could be the matter with them .
Parsing [sent. 3302 len. 24]: One is almost betrayed into respecting those criminals , they were so sincerely kind , and tender , and humane ; and well-meaning .
Parsing [sent. 3303 len. 22]: They did n't know why those exiled savages faded away , and they did their honest best to reason it out .
Parsing [sent. 3304 len. 46]: And one man , in a like case in New South Wales , did reason it out and arrive at a solution : `` It is from the wrath of God , which is revealed from heaven against cold ungodliness and unrighteousness of men . ''
Parsing [sent. 3305 len. 4]: That settles it .
Parsing [sent. 3306 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXVIII .
Parsing [sent. 3307 len. 8]: Let us be thankful for the fools .
Parsing [sent. 3308 len. 11]: But for them the rest of us could not succeed .
Parsing [sent. 3309 len. 9]: -- Pudd ` nhead Wilson 's New Calendar .
Parsing [sent. 3310 len. 18]: The aphorism does really seem true : `` Given the Circumstances , the Man will appear . ''
Parsing [sent. 3311 len. 16]: But the man mus n't appear ahead of time , or it will spoil everything .
Parsing [sent. 3312 len. 28]: In Robinson 's case the Moment had been approaching for a quarter of a century -- and meantime the future Conciliator was tranquilly laying bricks in Hobart .
Parsing [sent. 3313 len. 23]: When all other means had failed , the Moment had arrived , and the Bricklayer put down his trowel and came forward .
Parsing [sent. 3314 len. 12]: Earlier he would have been jeered back to his trowel again .
Parsing [sent. 3315 len. 22]: It reminds me of a tale that was told me by a Kentuckian on the train when we were crossing Montana .
Parsing [sent. 3316 len. 11]: He said the tale was current in Louisville years ago .
Parsing [sent. 3317 len. 13]: He thought it had been in print , but could not remember .
Parsing [sent. 3318 len. 21]: At any rate , in substance it was this , as nearly as I can call it back to mind .
Parsing [sent. 3319 len. 37]: A few years before the outbreak of the Civil War it began to appear that Memphis , Tennessee , was going to be a great tobacco entrepot -- the wise could see the signs of it .
Parsing [sent. 3320 len. 12]: At that time Memphis had a wharf boat , of course .
Parsing [sent. 3321 len. 39]: There was a paved sloping wharf , for the accommodation of freight , but the steamers landed on the outside of the wharfboat , and all loading and unloading was done across it , between steamer and shore .
Parsing [sent. 3322 len. 30]: A number of wharfboat clerks were needed , and part of the time , every day , they were very busy , and part of the time tediously idle .
Parsing [sent. 3323 len. 42]: They were boiling over with youth and spirits , and they had to make the intervals of idleness endurable in some way ; and as a rule , they did it by contriving practical jokes and playing them upon each other .
Parsing [sent. 3324 len. 34]: The favorite butt for the jokes was Ed Jackson , because he played none himself , and was easy game for other people 's -- for he always believed whatever was told him .
Parsing [sent. 3325 len. 12]: One day he told the others his scheme for his holiday .
Parsing [sent. 3326 len. 20]: He was not going fishing or hunting this time -- no , he had thought out a better plan .
Parsing [sent. 3327 len. 32]: Out of his $ 40 a month he had saved enough for his purpose , in an economical way , and he was going to have a look at New York .
Parsing [sent. 3328 len. 8]: It was a great and surprising idea .
Parsing [sent. 3329 len. 28]: It meant travel -- immense travel -- in those days it meant seeing the world ; it was the equivalent of a voyage around it in ours .
Parsing [sent. 3330 len. 43]: At first the other youths thought his mind was affected , but when they found that he was in earnest , the next thing to be thought of was , what sort of opportunity this venture might afford for a practical joke .
Parsing [sent. 3331 len. 18]: The young men studied over the matter , then held a secret consultation and made a plan .
Parsing [sent. 3332 len. 27]: The idea was , that one of the conspirators should offer Ed a letter of introduction to Commodore Vanderbilt , and trick him into delivering it .
Parsing [sent. 3333 len. 8]: It would be easy to do this .
Parsing [sent. 3334 len. 12]: But what would Ed do when he got back to Memphis ?
Parsing [sent. 3335 len. 6]: That was a serious matter .
Parsing [sent. 3336 len. 91]: He was good-hearted , and had always taken the jokes patiently ; but they had been jokes which did not humiliate him , did not bring him to shame ; whereas , this would be a cruel one in that way , and to play it was to meddle with fire ; for with all his good nature , Ed was a Southerner -- and the English of that was , that when he came back he would kill as many of the conspirators as he could before falling himself .
Parsing [sent. 3337 len. 20]: However , the chances must be taken -- it would n't do to waste such a joke as that .
Parsing [sent. 3338 len. 11]: So the letter was prepared with great care and elaboration .
Parsing [sent. 3339 len. 16]: It was signed Alfred Fairchild , and was written in an easy and friendly spirit .
Parsing [sent. 3340 len. 42]: It stated that the bearer was the bosom friend of the writer 's son , and was of good parts and sterling character , and it begged the Commodore to be kind to the young stranger for the writer 's sake .
Parsing [sent. 3341 len. 133]: It went on to say , `` You may have forgotten me , in this long stretch of time , but you will easily call me back out of your boyhood memories when I remind you of how we robbed old Stevenson 's orchard that night ; and how , while he was chasing down the road after us , we cut across the field and doubled back and sold his own apples to his own cook for a hat-full of doughnuts ; and the time that we -- '' and so forth and so on , bringing in names of imaginary comrades , and detailing all sorts of wild and absurd and , of course , wholly imaginary schoolboy pranks and adventures , but putting them into lively and telling shape .
Parsing [sent. 3342 len. 22]: With all gravity Ed was asked if he would like to have a letter to Commodore Vanderbilt , the great millionaire .
Parsing [sent. 3343 len. 14]: It was expected that the question would astonish Ed , and it did .
Parsing [sent. 3344 len. 3]: `` What ?
Parsing [sent. 3345 len. 8]: Do you know that extraordinary man ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3346 len. 8]: `` No ; but my father does .
Parsing [sent. 3347 len. 5]: They were schoolboys together .
Parsing [sent. 3348 len. 12]: And if you like , I 'll write and ask father .
Parsing [sent. 3349 len. 16]: I know he 'll be glad to give it to you for my sake . ''
Parsing [sent. 3350 len. 13]: Ed could not find words capable of expressing his gratitude and delight .
Parsing [sent. 3351 len. 14]: The three days passed , and the letter was put into his bands .
Parsing [sent. 3352 len. 18]: He started on his trip , still pouring out his thanks while he shook good-bye all around .
Parsing [sent. 3353 len. 33]: And when he was out of sight his comrades let fly their laughter in a storm of happy satisfaction -- and then quieted down , and were less happy , less satisfied .
Parsing [sent. 3354 len. 16]: For the old doubts as to the wisdom of this deception began to intrude again .
Parsing [sent. 3355 len. 46]: Arrived in New York , Ed found his way to Commodore Vanderbilt 's business quarters , and was ushered into a large anteroom , where a score of people were patiently awaiting their turn for a two-minute interview with the millionaire in his private office .
Parsing [sent. 3356 len. 14]: A servant asked for Ed 's card , and got the letter instead .
Parsing [sent. 3357 len. 24]: Ed was sent for a moment later , and found Mr. Vanderbilt alone , with the letter -- open -- in his hand .
Parsing [sent. 3358 len. 14]: `` Pray sit down , Mr. -- er -- '' `` Jackson . ''
Parsing [sent. 3359 len. 9]: `` Ah -- sit down , Mr. Jackson .
Parsing [sent. 3360 len. 15]: By the opening sentences it seems to be a letter from an old friend .
Parsing [sent. 3361 len. 11]: Allow me -- I will run my eye through it .
Parsing [sent. 3362 len. 12]: He says he says -- why , who is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3363 len. 9]: He turned the sheet and found the signature .
Parsing [sent. 3364 len. 15]: `` Alfred Fairchild -- hm -- Fairchild -- I do n't recall the name .
Parsing [sent. 3365 len. 13]: But that is nothing -- a thousand names have gone from me .
Parsing [sent. 3366 len. 13]: He says -- he says-hm-hmoh , dear , but it 's good !
Parsing [sent. 3367 len. 6]: Oh , it 's rare !
Parsing [sent. 3368 len. 20]: I do n't quite remember it , but I seem to it 'll all come back to me presently .
Parsing [sent. 3369 len. 16]: He says -- he says -- hm -- hm-oh , but that was a game !
Parsing [sent. 3370 len. 4]: Oh , spl-endid !
Parsing [sent. 3371 len. 6]: How it carries me back !
Parsing [sent. 3372 len. 41]: It 's all dim , of course it 's a long time ago -- and the names -- some of the names are wavery and indistinct -- but sho ' , I know it happened -- I can feel it !
Parsing [sent. 3373 len. 16]: and lord , how it warms my heart , and brings back my lost youth !
Parsing [sent. 3374 len. 41]: Well , well , well , I 've got to come back into this work-a-day world now -- business presses and people are waiting -- I 'll keep the rest for bed to-night , and live my youth over again .
Parsing [sent. 3375 len. 69]: And you 'll thank Fairchild for me when you see him -- I used to call him Alf , I think -- and you 'll give him my gratitude for -- what this letter has done for the tired spirit of a hard-worked man ; and tell him there is n't anything that I can do for him or any friend of his that I wo n't do .
Parsing [sent. 3376 len. 24]: And as for you , my lad , you are my guest ; you ca n't stop at any hotel in New York .
Parsing [sent. 3377 len. 2]: Sit .
Parsing [sent. 3378 len. 21]: where you are a little while , till I get through with these people , then we 'll go home .
Parsing [sent. 3379 len. 18]: I 'll take care of you , my boy -- make yourself easy as to that . ''
Parsing [sent. 3380 len. 40]: Ed stayed a week , and had an immense time -- and never suspected that the Commodore 's shrewd eye was on him , and that he was daily being weighed and measured and analyzed and tried and tested .
Parsing [sent. 3381 len. 26]: Yes , he had an immense time ; and never wrote home , but saved it all up to tell when he should get back .
Parsing [sent. 3382 len. 39]: Twice , with proper modesty and decency , he proposed to end his visit , but the Commodore said , `` No -- wait ; leave it to me ; I 'll tell you when to go . ''
Parsing [sent. 3383 len. 77]: In those days the Commodore was making some of those vast combinations of his -- consolidations of warring odds and ends of railroads into harmonious systems , and concentrations of floating and rudderless commerce in effective centers -- and among other things his farseeing eye had detected the convergence of that huge tobacco-commerce , already spoken of , toward Memphis , and he had resolved to set his grasp upon it and make it his own .
Parsing [sent. 3384 len. 7]: The week came to an end .
Parsing [sent. 3385 len. 12]: Then the Commodore said : `` Now you can start home .
Parsing [sent. 3386 len. 13]: But first we will have some more talk about that tobacco matter .
Parsing [sent. 3387 len. 5]: I know you now .
Parsing [sent. 3388 len. 15]: I know your abilities as well as you know them yourself -- perhaps better .
Parsing [sent. 3389 len. 32]: You understand that tobacco matter ; you understand that I am going to take possession of it , and you also understand the plans which I have matured for doing it .
Parsing [sent. 3390 len. 36]: What I want is a man who knows my mind , and is qualified to represent me in Memphis , and be in supreme command of that important business -- and I appoint you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3391 len. 4]: `` Me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3392 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 3393 len. 13]: Your salary will be high -- of course-for you are representing me .
Parsing [sent. 3394 len. 13]: Later you will earn increases of it , and will get them .
Parsing [sent. 3395 len. 16]: You will need a small army of assistants ; choose them yourself -- and carefully .
Parsing [sent. 3396 len. 32]: Take no man for friendship 's sake ; but , all things being equal , take the man you know , take your friend , in preference to the stranger . ''
Parsing [sent. 3397 len. 31]: After some further talk under this head , the Commodore said : `` Good-bye , my boy , and thank Alf for me , for sending you to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3398 len. 37]: When Ed reached Memphis he rushed down to the wharf in a fever to tell his great news and thank the boys over and over again for thinking to give him the letter to Mr. Vanderbilt .
Parsing [sent. 3399 len. 10]: It happened to be one of those idle times .
Parsing [sent. 3400 len. 13]: Blazing hot noonday , and no sign of life on the wharf .
Parsing [sent. 3401 len. 77]: But as Ed threaded his way among the freight piles , he saw a white linen figure stretched in slumber upon a pile of grain-sacks under an awning , and said to himself , `` That 's one of them , '' and hastened his step ; next , he said , `` It 's Charley -- it 's Fairchild good '' ; and the next moment laid an affectionate hand on the sleeper 's shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 3402 len. 39]: The eyes opened lazily , took one glance , the face blanched , the form whirled itself from the sack-pile , and in an instant Ed was alone and Fairchild was flying for the wharf-boat like the wind !
Parsing [sent. 3403 len. 6]: Ed was dazed , stupefied .
Parsing [sent. 3404 len. 4]: Was Fairchild crazy ?
Parsing [sent. 3405 len. 8]: What could be the meaning of this ?
Parsing [sent. 3406 len. 25]: He started slow and dreamily down toward the wharf-boat ; turned the corner of a freight-pile and came suddenly upon two of the boys .
Parsing [sent. 3407 len. 47]: They were lightly laughing over some pleasant matter ; they heard his step , and glanced up just as he discovered them ; the laugh died abruptly ; and before Ed could speak they were off , and sailing over barrels and bales like hunted deer .
Parsing [sent. 3408 len. 5]: Again Ed was paralyzed .
Parsing [sent. 3409 len. 7]: Had the boys all gone mad ?
Parsing [sent. 3410 len. 10]: What could be the explanation of this extraordinary conduct ?
Parsing [sent. 3411 len. 23]: And so , dreaming along , he reached the wharf-boat , and stepped aboard -- nothing but silence there , and vacancy .
Parsing [sent. 3412 len. 24]: He crossed the deck , turned the corner to go down the outer guard , heard a fervent -- `` O lord ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3413 len. 9]: and saw a white linen form plunge overboard .
Parsing [sent. 3414 len. 19]: The youth came up coughing and strangling , and cried out -- `` Go ` way from here !
Parsing [sent. 3415 len. 5]: You let me alone .
Parsing [sent. 3416 len. 13]: I did n't do it , I swear I did n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3417 len. 7]: `` Did n't do what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3418 len. 20]: `` Give you the -- '' `` Never mind what you did n't do -- come out of that !
Parsing [sent. 3419 len. 7]: What makes you all act so ?
Parsing [sent. 3420 len. 6]: What have I done ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3421 len. 3]: `` You ?
Parsing [sent. 3422 len. 7]: Why you have n't done anything .
Parsing [sent. 3423 len. 15]: But -- '' `` Well , then , what have you got against me ?
Parsing [sent. 3424 len. 10]: What do you all treat me so for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3425 len. 15]: `` I -- er -- but have n't you got anything against us ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3426 len. 5]: `` Of course not .
Parsing [sent. 3427 len. 10]: What put such a thing into your head ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3428 len. 8]: `` Honor bright -- you have n't ?
Parsing [sent. 3429 len. 5]: `` Honor bright . ''
Parsing [sent. 3430 len. 5]: `` Swear it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3431 len. 20]: `` I do n't know what in the world you mean , but I swear it , anyway . ''
Parsing [sent. 3432 len. 10]: `` And you 'll shake hands with me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3433 len. 9]: `` Goodness knows I 'll be glad to !
Parsing [sent. 3434 len. 13]: Why , I 'm just starving to shake hands with somebody ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3435 len. 18]: The swimmer muttered , `` Hang him , he smelt a rat and never delivered the letter !
Parsing [sent. 3436 len. 18]: -- but it 's all right , I 'm not going to fetch up the subject . ''
Parsing [sent. 3437 len. 13]: And he crawled out and came dripping and draining to shake hands .
Parsing [sent. 3438 len. 32]: First one and then another of the conspirators showed up cautiously -- armed to the teeth -- took in the amicable situation , then ventured warily forward and joined the love-feast .
Parsing [sent. 3439 len. 41]: And to Ed 's eager inquiry as to what made them act as they had been acting , they answered evasively , and pretended that they had put it up as a joke , to see what he would do .
Parsing [sent. 3440 len. 13]: It was the best explanation they could invent at such short notice .
Parsing [sent. 3441 len. 37]: And each said to himself , `` He never delivered that letter , and the joke is on us , if he only knew it or we were dull enough to come out and tell . ''
Parsing [sent. 3442 len. 36]: Then , of course , they wanted to know all about the trip ; and he said -- `` Come right up on the boiler deck and order the drinks -- it 's my treat .
Parsing [sent. 3443 len. 10]: I 'm going to tell you all about it .
Parsing [sent. 3444 len. 18]: And to-night it 's my treat again -- and we 'll have oysters and a time ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3445 len. 30]: When the drinks were brought and cigars lighted , Ed said : `` Well , when I delivered the letter to Mr. Vanderbilt -- '' `` Great Scott ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3446 len. 8]: `` Gracious , how you scared me .
Parsing [sent. 3447 len. 6]: What 's the matter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3448 len. 7]: `` Oh -- er -- nothing .
Parsing [sent. 3449 len. 14]: Nothing -- it was a tack in the chair-seat , '' said one .
Parsing [sent. 3450 len. 7]: `` But you all said it .
Parsing [sent. 3451 len. 5]: However , no matter .
Parsing [sent. 3452 len. 14]: When I delivered the letter -- '' `` Did you deliver it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3453 len. 17]: And they looked at each other as people might who thought that maybe they were dreaming .
Parsing [sent. 3454 len. 33]: Then they settled to listening ; and as the story deepened and its marvels grew , the amazement of it made them dumb , and the interest of it took their breath .
Parsing [sent. 3455 len. 20]: They hardly uttered a whisper during two hours , but sat like petrifactions and drank in the immortal romance .
Parsing [sent. 3456 len. 42]: At last the tale was ended , and Ed said -- `` And it 's all owing to you , boys , and you 'll never find me ungrateful -- bless your hearts , the best friends a fellow ever had !
Parsing [sent. 3457 len. 13]: You 'll all have places ; I want every one of you .
Parsing [sent. 3458 len. 18]: I know you -- I know you ` by the back , ' as the gamblers say .
Parsing [sent. 3459 len. 18]: You 're jokers , and all that , but you 're sterling , with the hallmark on .
Parsing [sent. 3460 len. 51]: And Charley Fairchild , you shall be my first assistant and right hand , because of your first-class ability , and because you got me the letter , and for your father 's sake who wrote it for me , and to please Mr. Vanderbilt , who said it would !
Parsing [sent. 3461 len. 12]: And here 's to that great man -- drink hearty ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3462 len. 30]: Yes , when the Moment comes , the Man appears -- even if he is a thousand miles away , and has to be discovered by a practical joke .
Parsing [sent. 3463 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXIX .
Parsing [sent. 3464 len. 24]: When people do not respect us we are sharply offended ; yet deep down in his private heart no man much respects himself .
Parsing [sent. 3465 len. 9]: -- Pudd ` nhead Wilson 's New Calendar .
Parsing [sent. 3466 len. 16]: Necessarily , the human interest is the first interest in the log-book of any country .
Parsing [sent. 3467 len. 18]: The annals of Tasmania , in whose shadow we were sailing , are lurid with that feature .
Parsing [sent. 3468 len. 49]: Tasmania was a convict-dump , in old times ; this has been indicated in the account of the Conciliator , where reference is made to vain attempts of desperate convicts to win to permanent freedom , after escaping from Macquarrie Harbor and the `` Gates of Hell . ''
Parsing [sent. 3469 len. 27]: In the early days Tasmania had a great population of convicts , of both sexes and all ages , and a bitter hard life they had .
Parsing [sent. 3470 len. 38]: In one spot there was a settlement of juvenile convicts -- children -- who had been sent thither from their home and their friends on the other side of the globe to expiate their `` crimes . ''
Parsing [sent. 3471 len. 23]: In due course our ship entered the estuary called the Derwent , at whose head stands Hobart , the capital of Tasmania .
Parsing [sent. 3472 len. 11]: The Derwent 's shores furnish scenery of an interesting sort .
Parsing [sent. 3473 len. 62]: The historian Laurie , whose book , `` The Story of Australasia , '' is just out , invoices its features with considerable truth and intemperance : `` The marvelous picturesqueness of every point of view , combined with the clear balmy atmosphere and the transparency of the ocean depths , must have delighted and deeply impressed '' the early explorers .
Parsing [sent. 3474 len. 97]: `` If the rock-bound coasts , sullen , defiant , and lowering , seemed uninviting , these were occasionally broken into charmingly alluring coves floored with golden sand , clad with evergreen shrubbery , and adorned with every variety of indigenous wattle , she-oak , wild flower , and fern , from the delicately graceful ` maiden-hair ' to the palm-like ` old man ' ; while the majestic gum-tree , clean and smooth as the mast of ` some tall ammiral ' pierces the clear air to the height of 230 feet or more . ''
Parsing [sent. 3475 len. 6]: It looked so to me .
Parsing [sent. 3476 len. 64]: `` Coasting along Tasman 's Peninsula , what a shock of pleasant wonder must have struck the early mariner on suddenly sighting Cape Pillar , with its cluster of black-ribbed basaltic columns rising to a height of 900 feet , the hydra head wreathed in a turban of fleecy cloud , the base lashed by jealous waves spouting angry fountains of foam . ''
Parsing [sent. 3477 len. 17]: That is well enough , but I did not suppose those snags were 900 feet high .
Parsing [sent. 3478 len. 8]: Still they were a very fine show .
Parsing [sent. 3479 len. 14]: They stood boldly out by themselves , and made a fascinatingly odd spectacle .
Parsing [sent. 3480 len. 15]: But there was nothing about their appearance to suggest the heads of a hydra .
Parsing [sent. 3481 len. 57]: They looked like a row of lofty slabs with their upper ends tapered to the shape of a carving-knife point ; in fact , the early voyager , ignorant of their great height , might have mistaken them for a rusty old rank of piles that had sagged this way and that out of the perpendicular .
Parsing [sent. 3482 len. 19]: The Peninsula is lofty , rocky , and densely clothed with scrub , or brush , or both .
Parsing [sent. 3483 len. 11]: It is joined to the main by a low neck .
Parsing [sent. 3484 len. 19]: At this junction was formerly a convict station called Port Arthur -- a place hard to escape from .
Parsing [sent. 3485 len. 47]: Behind it was the wilderness of scrub , in which a fugitive would soon starve ; in front was the narrow neck , with a cordon of chained dogs across it , and a line of lanterns , and a fence of living guards , armed .
Parsing [sent. 3486 len. 28]: We saw the place as we swept by -- that is , we had a glimpse of what we were told was the entrance to Port Arthur .
Parsing [sent. 3487 len. 15]: The glimpse was worth something , as a remembrancer , but that was all .
Parsing [sent. 3488 len. 22]: The voyage thence up the Derwent Frith displays a grand succession of fairy visions , in its entire length elsewhere unequaled .
Parsing [sent. 3489 len. 34]: In gliding over the deep blue sea studded with lovely islets luxuriant to the water 's edge , one is at a loss which scene to choose for contemplation and to admire most .
Parsing [sent. 3490 len. 57]: When the Huon and Bruni have been passed , there seems no possible chance of a rival ; but suddenly Mount Wellington , massive and noble like his brother Etna , literally heaves in sight , sternly guarded on either hand by Mounts Nelson and Rumney ; presently we arrive at Sullivan 's Cove -- Hobart !
Parsing [sent. 3491 len. 6]: It is an attractive town .
Parsing [sent. 3492 len. 26]: It sits on low hills that slope to the harbor -- a harbor that looks like a river , and is as smooth as one .
Parsing [sent. 3493 len. 17]: Its still surface is pictured with dainty reflections of boats and grassy banks and luxuriant foliage .
Parsing [sent. 3494 len. 33]: Back of the town rise highlands that are clothed in woodland loveliness , and over the way is that noble mountain , Wellington , a stately bulk , a most majestic pile .
Parsing [sent. 3495 len. 60]: How beautiful is the whole region , for form , and grouping , and opulence , and freshness of foliage , and variety of color , and grace and shapeliness of the hills , the capes , the promontories ; and then , the splendor of the sunlight , the dim rich distances , the charm of the water-glimpses !
Parsing [sent. 3496 len. 41]: And it was in this paradise that the yellow-liveried convicts were landed , and the Corps-bandits quartered , and the wanton slaughter of the kangaroo-chasing black innocents consummated on that autumn day in May , in the brutish old time .
Parsing [sent. 3497 len. 20]: It was all out of keeping with the place , a sort of bringing of heaven and hell together .
Parsing [sent. 3498 len. 24]: The remembrance of this paradise reminds me that it was at Hobart that we struck the head of the procession of Junior Englands .
Parsing [sent. 3499 len. 20]: We were to encounter other sections of it in New Zealand , presently , and others later in Natal .
Parsing [sent. 3500 len. 52]: Wherever the exiled Englishman can find in his new home resemblances to his old one , he is touched to the marrow of his being ; the love that is in his heart inspires his imagination , and these allied forces transfigure those resemblances into authentic duplicates of the revered originals .
Parsing [sent. 3501 len. 57]: It is beautiful , the feeling which works this enchantment , and it compels one 's homage ; compels it , and also compels one 's assent -- compels it always -- even when , as happens sometimes , one does not see the resemblances as clearly as does the exile who is pointing them out .
Parsing [sent. 3502 len. 36]: The resemblances do exist , it is quite true ; and often they cunningly approximate the originals -- but after all , in the matter of certain physical patent rights there is only one England .
Parsing [sent. 3503 len. 14]: Now that I have sampled the globe , I am not in doubt .
Parsing [sent. 3504 len. 119]: There is a beauty of Switzerland , and it is repeated in the glaciers and snowy ranges of many parts of the earth ; there is a beauty of the fiord , and it is repeated in New Zealand and Alaska ; there is a beauty of Hawaii , and it is repeated in ten thousand islands of the Southern seas ; there is a beauty of the prairie and the plain , and it is repeated here and there in the earth ; each of these is worshipful , each is perfect in its way , yet holds no monopoly of its beauty ; but that beauty which is England is alone -- it has no duplicate .
Parsing [sent. 3505 len. 56]: It is made up of very simple details -- just grass , and trees , and shrubs , and roads , and hedges , and gardens , and houses , and vines , and churches , and castles , and here and there a ruin -- and over it all a mellow dream-haze of history .
Parsing [sent. 3506 len. 11]: But its beauty is incomparable , and all its own .
Parsing [sent. 3507 len. 28]: Hobart has a peculiarity -- it is the neatest town that the sun shines on ; and I incline to believe that it is also the cleanest .
Parsing [sent. 3508 len. 15]: However that may be , its supremacy in neatness is not to be questioned .
Parsing [sent. 3509 len. 77]: There can not be another town in the world that has no shabby exteriors ; no rickety gates and fences , no neglected houses crumbling to ruin , no crazy and unsightly sheds , no weed-grown front-yards of the poor , no back-yards littered with tin cans and old boots and empty bottles , no rubbish in the gutters , no clutter on the sidewalks , no outer-borders fraying out into dirty lanes and tin-patched huts .
Parsing [sent. 3510 len. 51]: No , in Hobart all the aspects are tidy , and all a comfort to the eye ; the modestest cottage looks combed and brushed , and has its vines , its flowers , its neat fence , its neat gate , its comely cat asleep on the window ledge .
Parsing [sent. 3511 len. 20]: We had a glimpse of the museum , by courtesy of the American gentleman who is curator of it .
Parsing [sent. 3512 len. 23]: It has samples of half-a-dozen different kinds of marsupials -- -LSB- A marsupial is a plantigrade vertebrate whose specialty is its pocket .
Parsing [sent. 3513 len. 14]: In some countries it is extinct , in the others it is rare .
Parsing [sent. 3514 len. 29]: The first American marsupials were Stephen Girard , Mr. Astor and the opossum ; the principal marsupials of the Southern Hemisphere are Mr. Rhodes , and the kangaroo .
Parsing [sent. 3515 len. 9]: I , myself , am the latest marsupial .
Parsing [sent. 3516 len. 15]: Also , I might boast that I have the largest pocket of them all .
Parsing [sent. 3517 len. 8]: But there is nothing in that . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 3518 len. 20]: -- one , the `` Tasmanian devil ; '' that is , I think he was one of them .
Parsing [sent. 3519 len. 8]: And there was a fish with lungs .
Parsing [sent. 3520 len. 12]: When the water dries up it can live in the mud .
Parsing [sent. 3521 len. 11]: Most curious of all was a parrot that kills sheep .
Parsing [sent. 3522 len. 15]: On one great sheep-run this bird killed a thousand sheep in a whole year .
Parsing [sent. 3523 len. 13]: He does n't want the whole sheep , but only the kidney-fat .
Parsing [sent. 3524 len. 11]: This restricted taste makes him an expensive bird to support .
Parsing [sent. 3525 len. 19]: To get the fat he drives his beak in and rips it out ; the wound is mortal .
Parsing [sent. 3526 len. 14]: This parrot furnishes a notable example of evolution brought about by changed conditions .
Parsing [sent. 3527 len. 30]: When the sheep culture was introduced , it presently brought famine to the parrot by exterminating a kind of grub which had always thitherto been the parrot 's diet .
Parsing [sent. 3528 len. 40]: The miseries of hunger made the bird willing to eat raw flesh , since it could get no other food , and it began to pick remnants of meat from sheep skins hung out on the fences to dry .
Parsing [sent. 3529 len. 30]: It soon came to prefer sheep meat to any other food , and by and by it came to prefer the kidney-fat to any other detail of the sheep .
Parsing [sent. 3530 len. 57]: The parrot 's bill was not well shaped for digging out the fat , but Nature fixed that matter ; she altered the bill 's shape , and now the parrot can dig out kidney-fat better than the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court , or anybody else , for that matter -- even an Admiral .
Parsing [sent. 3531 len. 70]: And there was another curiosity -- quite a stunning one , I thought : Arrow-heads and knives just like those which Primeval Man made out of flint , and thought he had done such a wonderful thing -- yes , and has been humored and coddled in that superstition by this age of admiring scientists until there is probably no living with him in the other world by now .
Parsing [sent. 3532 len. 42]: Yet here is his finest and nicest work exactly duplicated in our day ; and by people who have never heard of him or his works : by aborigines who lived in the islands of these seas , within our time .
Parsing [sent. 3533 len. 43]: And they not only duplicated those works of art but did it in the brittlest and most treacherous of substances -- glass : made them out of old brandy bottles flung out of the British camps ; millions of tons of them .
Parsing [sent. 3534 len. 15]: It is time for Primeval Man to make a little less noise , now .
Parsing [sent. 3535 len. 6]: He has had his day .
Parsing [sent. 3536 len. 9]: He is not what he used to be .
Parsing [sent. 3537 len. 33]: We had a drive through a bloomy and odorous fairy-land , to the Refuge for the Indigent -- a spacious and comfortable home , with hospitals , etc. , for both sexes .
Parsing [sent. 3538 len. 15]: There was a crowd there , of the oldest people I have ever seen .
Parsing [sent. 3539 len. 34]: It was like being suddenly set down in a new world -- a weird world where Youth has never been , a world sacred to Age , and bowed forms , and wrinkles .
Parsing [sent. 3540 len. 54]: Out of the 359 persons present , 223 were ex-convicts , and could have told stirring tales , no doubt , if they had been minded to talk ; 42 of the 359 were past 80 , and several were close upon 90 ; the average age at death there is 76 years .
Parsing [sent. 3541 len. 17]: As for me , I have no use for that place ; it is too healthy .
Parsing [sent. 3542 len. 14]: Seventy is old enough -- after that , there is too much risk .
Parsing [sent. 3543 len. 16]: Youth and gaiety might vanish , any day -- and then , what is left ?
Parsing [sent. 3544 len. 14]: Death in life ; death without its privileges , death without its benefits .
Parsing [sent. 3545 len. 15]: There were 185 women in that Refuge , and 81 of them were ex-convicts .
Parsing [sent. 3546 len. 5]: The steamer disappointed us .
Parsing [sent. 3547 len. 18]: Instead of making a long visit at Hobart , as usual , she made a short one .
Parsing [sent. 3548 len. 14]: So we got but a glimpse of Tasmania , and then moved on .
Parsing [sent. 3549 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXX .
Parsing [sent. 3550 len. 21]: Nature makes the locust with an appetite for crops ; man would have made him with an appetite for sand .
Parsing [sent. 3551 len. 9]: -- Pudd ` nhead Wilson 's New Calendar .
Parsing [sent. 3552 len. 25]: We spent part of an afternoon and a night at sea , and reached Bluff , in New Zealand , early in the morning .
Parsing [sent. 3553 len. 24]: Bluff is at the bottom of the middle island , and is away down south , nearly fort y-seven degrees below the equator .
Parsing [sent. 3554 len. 38]: It lies as far south of the line as Quebec lies north of it , and the climates of the two should be alike ; but for some reason or other it has not been so arranged .
Parsing [sent. 3555 len. 52]: Quebec is hot in the summer and cold in the winter , but Bluff 's climate is less intense ; the cold weather is not very cold , the hot weather is not very hot ; and the difference between the hottest month and the coldest is but 17 degrees Fahrenheit .
Parsing [sent. 3556 len. 10]: In New Zealand the rabbit plague began at Bluff .
Parsing [sent. 3557 len. 26]: The man who introduced the rabbit there was banqueted and lauded ; but they would hang him , now , if they could get him .
Parsing [sent. 3558 len. 32]: In England the natural enemy of the rabbit is detested and persecuted ; in the Bluff region the natural enemy of the rabbit is honored , and his person is sacred .
Parsing [sent. 3559 len. 33]: The rabbit 's natural enemy in England is the poacher , in Bluff its natural enemy is the stoat , the weasel , the ferret , the cat , and the mongoose .
Parsing [sent. 3560 len. 78]: In England any person below the Heir who is caught with a rabbit in his possession must satisfactorily explain how it got there , or he will suffer fine and imprisonment , together with extinction of his peerage ; in Bluff , the cat found with a rabbit in its possession does not have to explain -- everybody looks the other way ; the person caught noticing would suffer fine and imprisonment , with extinction of peerage .
Parsing [sent. 3561 len. 14]: This is a sure way to undermine the moral fabric of a cat .
Parsing [sent. 3562 len. 15]: Thirty years from now there will not be a moral cat in New Zealand .
Parsing [sent. 3563 len. 8]: Some think there is none there now .
Parsing [sent. 3564 len. 43]: In England the poacher is watched , tracked , hunted -- he dare not show his face ; in Bluff the cat , the weasel , the stoat , and the mongoose go up and down , whither they will , unmolested .
Parsing [sent. 3565 len. 50]: By a law of the legislature , posted where all may read , it is decreed that any person found in possession of one of these creatures -LRB- dead -RRB- must satisfactorily explain the circumstances or pay a fine of not less than L5 , nor more than L20 .
Parsing [sent. 3566 len. 9]: The revenue from this source is not large .
Parsing [sent. 3567 len. 20]: Persons who want to pay a hundred dollars for a dead cat are getting rarer and rarer every day .
Parsing [sent. 3568 len. 17]: This is bad , for the revenue was to go to the endowment of a University .
Parsing [sent. 3569 len. 25]: All governments are more or less short-sighted : in England they fine the poacher , whereas he ought to be banished to New Zealand .
Parsing [sent. 3570 len. 12]: New Zealand would pay his way , and give him wages .
Parsing [sent. 3571 len. 84]: It was from Bluff that we ought to have cut across to the west coast and visited the New Zealand Switzerland , a land of superb scenery , made up of snowy grandeurs , anal mighty glaciers , and beautiful lakes ; and over there , also , are the wonderful rivals of the Norwegian and Alaskan fiords ; and for neighbor , a waterfall of 1,900 feet ; but we were obliged to postpone the trip to some later and indefinite time .
Parsing [sent. 3572 len. 3]: November 6 .
Parsing [sent. 3573 len. 9]: A lovely summer morning ; brilliant blue sky .
Parsing [sent. 3574 len. 18]: A few miles out from Invercargill , passed through vast level green expanses snowed over with sheep .
Parsing [sent. 3575 len. 4]: Fine to see .
Parsing [sent. 3576 len. 20]: The green , deep and very vivid sometimes ; at other times less so , but delicate and lovely .
Parsing [sent. 3577 len. 17]: A passenger reminds me that I am in `` the England of the Far South . ''
Parsing [sent. 3578 len. 5]: Dunedin , same date .
Parsing [sent. 3579 len. 8]: The town justifies Michael Davitt 's praises .
Parsing [sent. 3580 len. 5]: The people are Scotch .
Parsing [sent. 3581 len. 14]: They stopped here on their way from home to heaven-thinking they had arrived .
Parsing [sent. 3582 len. 21]: The population is stated at 40,000 , by Malcolm Ross , journalist ; stated by an M. P. at 60,000 .
Parsing [sent. 3583 len. 6]: A journalist can not lie .
Parsing [sent. 3584 len. 7]: To the residence of Dr. Hockin .
Parsing [sent. 3585 len. 24]: He has a fine collection of books relating to New Zealand ; and his house is a museum of Maori art and antiquities .
Parsing [sent. 3586 len. 23]: He has pictures and prints in color of many native chiefs of the past -- some of them of note in history .
Parsing [sent. 3587 len. 37]: There is nothing of the savage in the faces ; nothing could be finer than these men 's features , nothing more intellectual than these faces , nothing more masculine , nothing nobler than their aspect .
Parsing [sent. 3588 len. 18]: The aboriginals of Australia and Tasmania looked the savage , but these chiefs looked like Roman patricians .
Parsing [sent. 3589 len. 19]: The tattooing in these portraits ought to suggest the savage , of course , but it does not .
Parsing [sent. 3590 len. 17]: The designs are so flowing and graceful and beautiful that they are a most satisfactory decoration .
Parsing [sent. 3591 len. 25]: It takes but fifteen minutes to get reconciled to the tattooing , and but fifteen more to perceive that it is just the thing .
Parsing [sent. 3592 len. 12]: After that , the undecorated European face is unpleasant and ignoble .
Parsing [sent. 3593 len. 33]: Dr. Hockin gave us a ghastly curiosity -- a lignified caterpillar with a plant growing out of the back of its neck -- a plant with a slender stem 4 inches high .
Parsing [sent. 3594 len. 14]: It happened not by accident , but by design -- Nature 's design .
Parsing [sent. 3595 len. 91]: This caterpillar was in the act of loyally carrying out a law inflicted upon him by Nature -- a law purposely inflicted upon him to get him into trouble -- a law which was a trap ; in pursuance of this law he made the proper preparations for turning himself into a night-moth ; that is to say , he dug a little trench , a little grave , and then stretched himself out in it on his stomach and partially buried himself -- then Nature was ready for him .
Parsing [sent. 3596 len. 15]: She blew the spores of a peculiar fungus through the air with a purpose .
Parsing [sent. 3597 len. 36]: Some of them fell into a crease in the back of the caterpillar 's neck , and began to sprout and grow -- for there was soil there -- he had not washed his neck .
Parsing [sent. 3598 len. 37]: The roots forced themselves down into the worm 's person , and rearward along through its body , sucking up the creature 's juices for sap ; the worm slowly died , and turned to wood .
Parsing [sent. 3599 len. 52]: And here he was now , a wooden caterpillar , with every detail of his former physique delicately and exactly preserved and perpetuated , and with that stem standing up out of him for his monument -- monument commemorative of his own loyalty and of Nature 's unfair return for it .
Parsing [sent. 3600 len. 7]: Nature is always acting like that .
Parsing [sent. 3601 len. 18]: Mrs. X. said -LRB- of course -RRB- that the caterpillar was not conscious and did n't suffer .
Parsing [sent. 3602 len. 6]: She should have known better .
Parsing [sent. 3603 len. 6]: No caterpillar can deceive Nature .
Parsing [sent. 3604 len. 20]: If this one could n't suffer , Nature would have known it and would have hunted up another caterpillar .
Parsing [sent. 3605 len. 16]: Not that she would have let this one go , merely because it was defective .
Parsing [sent. 3606 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 3607 len. 20]: She would have waited and let him turn into a night-moth ; and then fried him in the candle .
Parsing [sent. 3608 len. 26]: Nature cakes a fish 's eyes over with parasites , so that it sha n't be able to avoid its enemies or find its food .
Parsing [sent. 3609 len. 57]: She sends parasites into a star-fish 's system , which clog up its prongs and swell them and make them so uncomfortable that the poor creature delivers itself from the prong to ease its misery ; and presently it has to part with another prong for the sake of comfort , and finally with a third .
Parsing [sent. 3610 len. 16]: If it re-grows the prongs , the parasite returns and the same thing is repeated .
Parsing [sent. 3611 len. 32]: And finally , when the ability to reproduce prongs is lost through age , that poor old star-fish ca n't get around any more , and so it dies of starvation .
Parsing [sent. 3612 len. 15]: In Australia is prevalent a horrible disease due to an `` unperfected tapeworm . ''
Parsing [sent. 3613 len. 36]: Unperfected -- that is what they call it , I do not know why , for it transacts business just as well as if it were finished and frescoed and gilded , and all that .
Parsing [sent. 3614 len. 3]: November 9 .
Parsing [sent. 3615 len. 16]: To the museum and public picture gallery with the president of the Society of Artists .
Parsing [sent. 3616 len. 25]: Some fine pictures there , lent by the S. of A. several of them they bought , the others came to them by gift .
Parsing [sent. 3617 len. 17]: Next , to the gallery of the S. of A. -- annual exhibition -- just opened .
Parsing [sent. 3618 len. 2]: Fine .
Parsing [sent. 3619 len. 19]: Think of a town like this having two such collections as this , and a Society of Artists .
Parsing [sent. 3620 len. 7]: It is so all over Australasia .
Parsing [sent. 3621 len. 10]: If it were a monarchy one might understand it .
Parsing [sent. 3622 len. 19]: I mean an absolute monarchy , where it is n't necessary to vote money , but take it .
Parsing [sent. 3623 len. 4]: Then art flourishes .
Parsing [sent. 3624 len. 23]: But these colonies are republics -- republics with a wide suffrage ; voters of both sexes , this one of New Zealand .
Parsing [sent. 3625 len. 18]: In republics , neither the government nor the rich private citizen is much given to propagating art .
Parsing [sent. 3626 len. 23]: All over Australasia pictures by famous European artists are bought for the public galleries by the State and by societies of citizens .
Parsing [sent. 3627 len. 7]: Living citizens -- not dead ones .
Parsing [sent. 3628 len. 10]: They rob themselves to give , not their heirs .
Parsing [sent. 3629 len. 14]: This S. of A. here owns its building -- built it by subscription .
Parsing [sent. 3630 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXXI .
Parsing [sent. 3631 len. 21]: The spirit of wrath -- not the words -- is the sin ; and the spirit of wrath is cursing .
Parsing [sent. 3632 len. 9]: We begin to swear before we can talk .
Parsing [sent. 3633 len. 9]: -- Pudd ` nhead Wilson 's New Calendar .
Parsing [sent. 3634 len. 3]: November 11 .
Parsing [sent. 3635 len. 4]: On the road .
Parsing [sent. 3636 len. 35]: This train-express goes twenty and one-half miles an hour , schedule time ; but it is fast enough , the outlook upon sea and land is so interesting , and the cars so comfortable .
Parsing [sent. 3637 len. 18]: They are not English , and not American ; they are the Swiss combination of the two .
Parsing [sent. 3638 len. 18]: A narrow and railed porch along the side , where a person can walk up and down .
Parsing [sent. 3639 len. 6]: A lavatory in each car .
Parsing [sent. 3640 len. 9]: This is progress ; this is nineteenth-century spirit .
Parsing [sent. 3641 len. 12]: In New Zealand , these fast expresses run twice a week .
Parsing [sent. 3642 len. 50]: It is well to know this if you want to be a bird and fly through the country at a 20-mile gait ; otherwise you may start on one of the five wrong days , and then you will get a train that ca n't overtake its own shadow .
Parsing [sent. 3643 len. 29]: By contrast , these pleasant cars call to mind the branch-road cars at Maryborough , Australia , and the passengers ' talk about the branch-road and the hotel .
Parsing [sent. 3644 len. 15]: Somewhere on the road to Maryborough I changed for a while to a smoking-carriage .
Parsing [sent. 3645 len. 18]: There were two gentlemen there ; both riding backward , one at each end of the compartment .
Parsing [sent. 3646 len. 7]: They were acquaintances of each other .
Parsing [sent. 3647 len. 13]: I sat down facing the one that sat at the starboard window .
Parsing [sent. 3648 len. 24]: He had a good face , and a friendly look , and I judged from his dress that he was a dissenting minister .
Parsing [sent. 3649 len. 6]: He was along toward fifty .
Parsing [sent. 3650 len. 22]: Of his own motion he struck a match , and shaded it with his hand for me to light my cigar .
Parsing [sent. 3651 len. 20]: I take the rest from my diary : In order to start conversation I asked him something about Maryborough .
Parsing [sent. 3652 len. 34]: He said , in a most pleasant -- even musical voice , but with quiet and cultured decision : `` It 's a charming town , with a hell of a hotel . ''
Parsing [sent. 3653 len. 4]: I was astonished .
Parsing [sent. 3654 len. 12]: It seemed so odd to hear a minister swear out loud .
Parsing [sent. 3655 len. 14]: He went placidly on : `` It 's the worst hotel in Australia .
Parsing [sent. 3656 len. 13]: Well , one may go further , and say in Australasia . ''
Parsing [sent. 3657 len. 5]: `` Bad beds ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3658 len. 7]: `` No -- none at all .
Parsing [sent. 3659 len. 4]: Just sand-bags . ''
Parsing [sent. 3660 len. 7]: `` The pillows , too ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3661 len. 8]: `` Yes , the pillows , too .
Parsing [sent. 3662 len. 3]: Just sand .
Parsing [sent. 3663 len. 8]: And not a good quality of sand .
Parsing [sent. 3664 len. 11]: It packs too hard , and has never been screened .
Parsing [sent. 3665 len. 8]: There is too much gravel in it .
Parsing [sent. 3666 len. 8]: It is like sleeping on nuts . ''
Parsing [sent. 3667 len. 9]: `` Is n't there any good sand ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3668 len. 5]: `` Plenty of it .
Parsing [sent. 3669 len. 14]: There is as good bed-sand in this region as the world can furnish .
Parsing [sent. 3670 len. 13]: Aerated sand -- and loose ; but they wo n't buy it .
Parsing [sent. 3671 len. 12]: They want something that will pack solid , and petrify . ''
Parsing [sent. 3672 len. 7]: `` How are the rooms ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3673 len. 26]: `` Eight feet square ; and a sheet of iced oil-cloth to step on in the morning when you get out of the sand-quarry . ''
Parsing [sent. 3674 len. 6]: `` As to lights ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3675 len. 5]: `` Coal-oil lamp . ''
Parsing [sent. 3676 len. 6]: `` A good one ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3677 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 3678 len. 10]: It 's the kind that sheds a gloom . ''
Parsing [sent. 3679 len. 11]: `` I like a lamp that burns all night . ''
Parsing [sent. 3680 len. 6]: `` This one wo n't .
Parsing [sent. 3681 len. 8]: You must blow it out early . ''
Parsing [sent. 3682 len. 5]: `` That is bad .
Parsing [sent. 3683 len. 9]: One might want it again in the night .
Parsing [sent. 3684 len. 9]: Ca n't find it in the dark . ''
Parsing [sent. 3685 len. 15]: `` There 's no trouble ; you can find it by the stench . ''
Parsing [sent. 3686 len. 4]: `` Wardrobe ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3687 len. 20]: `` Two nails on the door to hang seven suits of clothes on if you 've got them . ''
Parsing [sent. 3688 len. 4]: `` Bells ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3689 len. 7]: `` There are n't any . ''
Parsing [sent. 3690 len. 11]: `` What do you do when you want service ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3691 len. 3]: `` Shout .
Parsing [sent. 3692 len. 8]: But it wo n't fetch anybody . ''
Parsing [sent. 3693 len. 12]: `` Suppose you want the chambermaid to empty the slopjar ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3694 len. 7]: `` There is n't any slop-jar .
Parsing [sent. 3695 len. 7]: The hotels do n't keep them .
Parsing [sent. 3696 len. 10]: That is , outside of Sydney and Melbourne . ''
Parsing [sent. 3697 len. 7]: `` Yes , I knew that .
Parsing [sent. 3698 len. 5]: I was only talking .
Parsing [sent. 3699 len. 8]: It 's the oddest thing in Australia .
Parsing [sent. 3700 len. 24]: Another thing : I 've got to get up in the dark , in the morning , to take the 5 o'clock train .
Parsing [sent. 3701 len. 13]: Now if the boots -- '' `` There is n't any . ''
Parsing [sent. 3702 len. 7]: `` Well , the porter . ''
Parsing [sent. 3703 len. 7]: `` There is n't any . ''
Parsing [sent. 3704 len. 8]: `` But who will call me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3705 len. 3]: `` Nobody .
Parsing [sent. 3706 len. 5]: You 'll call yourself .
Parsing [sent. 3707 len. 8]: And you 'll light yourself , too .
Parsing [sent. 3708 len. 13]: There 'll not be a light burning in the halls or anywhere .
Parsing [sent. 3709 len. 16]: And if you do n't carry a light , you 'll break your neck . ''
Parsing [sent. 3710 len. 12]: `` But who will help me down with my baggage ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3711 len. 3]: `` Nobody .
Parsing [sent. 3712 len. 10]: However , I will tell you what to do .
Parsing [sent. 3713 len. 23]: In Maryborough there 's an American who has lived there half a lifetime ; a fine man , and prosperous and popular .
Parsing [sent. 3714 len. 16]: He will be on the lookout for you ; you wo n't have any trouble .
Parsing [sent. 3715 len. 17]: Sleep in peace ; he will rout you out , and you will make your train .
Parsing [sent. 3716 len. 6]: Where is your manager ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3717 len. 11]: `` I left him at Ballarat , studying the language .
Parsing [sent. 3718 len. 17]: And besides , he had to go to Melbourne and get us ready for New Zealand .

Parsing [sent. 3720 len. 3]: `` Easy !
Parsing [sent. 3721 len. 16]: You 've selected the very most difficult piece of railroad in Australia for your experiment .
Parsing [sent. 3722 len. 27]: There are twelve miles of this road which no man without good executive ability can ever hope -- tell me , have you good executive ability ?

Parsing [sent. 3724 len. 17]: `` I -- well , I think so , but -- '' `` That settles it .
Parsing [sent. 3725 len. 16]: The tone of -- oh , you would n't ever make it in the world .
Parsing [sent. 3726 len. 14]: However , that American will point you right , and you 'll go .
Parsing [sent. 3727 len. 6]: You 've got tickets ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3728 len. 13]: `` Yes -- round trip ; all the way to Sydney . ''
Parsing [sent. 3729 len. 10]: `` Ah , there it is , you see !
Parsing [sent. 3730 len. 32]: You are going in the 5 o'clock by Castlemaine -- twelve miles -- instead of the 7.15 by Ballarat -- in order to save two hours of fooling along the road .
Parsing [sent. 3731 len. 13]: Now then , do n't interrupt -- let me have the floor .
Parsing [sent. 3732 len. 50]: You 're going to save the government a deal of hauling , but that 's nothing ; your ticket is by Ballarat , and it is n't good over that twelve miles , and so -- '' `` But why should the government care which way I go ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3733 len. 4]: `` Goodness knows !
Parsing [sent. 3734 len. 26]: Ask of the winds that far away with fragments strewed the sea , as the boy that stood on the burning deck used to say .
Parsing [sent. 3735 len. 26]: The government chooses to do its railway business in its own way , and it does n't know as much about it as the French .
Parsing [sent. 3736 len. 37]: In the beginning they tried idiots ; then they imported the French -- which was going backwards , you see ; now it runs the roads itself -- which is going backwards again , you see .
Parsing [sent. 3737 len. 70]: Why , do you know , in order to curry favor with the voters , the government puts down a road wherever anybody wants it -- anybody that owns two sheep and a dog ; and by consequence we 've got , in the colony of Victoria , 800 railway stations , and the business done at eighty of them does n't foot up twenty shillings a week . ''
Parsing [sent. 3738 len. 4]: `` Five dollars ?
Parsing [sent. 3739 len. 5]: Oh , come ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3740 len. 5]: `` It 's true .
Parsing [sent. 3741 len. 7]: It 's the absolute truth . ''
Parsing [sent. 3742 len. 16]: `` Why , there are three or four men on wages at every station . ''
Parsing [sent. 3743 len. 5]: `` I know it .
Parsing [sent. 3744 len. 15]: And the station-business does n't pay for the sheep-dip to sanctify their coffee with .
Parsing [sent. 3745 len. 7]: It 's just as I say .
Parsing [sent. 3746 len. 3]: And accommodating ?
Parsing [sent. 3747 len. 22]: Why , if you shake a rag the train will stop in the midst of the wilderness to pick you up .
Parsing [sent. 3748 len. 10]: All that kind of politics costs , you see .
Parsing [sent. 3749 len. 22]: And then , besides , any town that has a good many votes and wants a fine station , gets it .
Parsing [sent. 3750 len. 17]: Do n't you overlook that Maryborough station , if you take an interest in governmental curiosities .
Parsing [sent. 3751 len. 26]: Why , you can put the whole population of Maryborough into it , and give them a sofa apiece , and have room for more .
Parsing [sent. 3752 len. 24]: You have n't fifteen stations in America that are as big , and you probably have n't five that are half as fine .
Parsing [sent. 3753 len. 7]: Why , it 's perfectly elegant .
Parsing [sent. 3754 len. 4]: And the clock !
Parsing [sent. 3755 len. 7]: Everybody will show you the clock .
Parsing [sent. 3756 len. 14]: There is n't a station in Europe that 's got such a clock .
Parsing [sent. 3757 len. 11]: It does n't strike -- and that 's one mercy .
Parsing [sent. 3758 len. 29]: It has n't any bell ; and as you 'll have cause to remember , if you keep your reason , all Australia is simply bedamned with bells .
Parsing [sent. 3759 len. 137]: On every quarter-hour , night and day , they jingle a tiresome chime of half a dozen notes -- all the clocks in town at once , all the clocks in Australasia at once , and all the very same notes ; first , downward scale : mi , re , do , sol -- then upward scale : sol , si , re , do -- down again : mi , re , do , sol -- up again : sol , si , re , do -- then the clock -- say at midnight clang -- clang -- clang -- clang -- clang -- clang -- clang -- clang -- clang -- clang -- clang -- clang -- and , by that time you 're -- hello , what 's all this excitement about ?
Parsing [sent. 3760 len. 24]: Oh I see -- a runaway -- scared by the train ; why , you would n't think this train could scare anything .
Parsing [sent. 3761 len. 40]: Well , of course , when they build and run eighty stations at a loss and a lot of palace-stations and clocks like Maryborough 's at another loss , the government has got to economize somewhere has n't it ?
Parsing [sent. 3762 len. 8]: Very well look at the rolling stock .
Parsing [sent. 3763 len. 8]: That 's where they save the money .
Parsing [sent. 3764 len. 38]: Why , that train from Maryborough will consist of eighteen freight-cars and two passenger-kennels ; cheap , poor , shabby , slovenly ; no drinking water , no sanitary arrangements , every imaginable inconvenience ; and slow ?
Parsing [sent. 3765 len. 29]: -- oh , the gait of cold molasses ; no air-brake , no springs , and they 'll jolt your head off every time they start or stop .
Parsing [sent. 3766 len. 12]: That 's where they make their little economies , you see .
Parsing [sent. 3767 len. 33]: They spend tons of money to house you palatially while you wait fifteen minutes for a train , then degrade you to six hours ' convict-transportation to get the foolish outlay back .
Parsing [sent. 3768 len. 26]: What a rational man really needs is discomfort while he 's waiting , then his journey in a nice train would be a grateful change .
Parsing [sent. 3769 len. 17]: But no , that would be common sense -- and out of place in a government .
Parsing [sent. 3770 len. 55]: And then , besides , they save in that other little detail , you know -- repudiate their own tickets , and collect a poor little illegitimate extra shilling out of you for that twelve miles , and -- '' `` Well , in any case -- '' `` Wait -- there 's more .
Parsing [sent. 3771 len. 13]: Leave that American out of the account and see what would happen .
Parsing [sent. 3772 len. 13]: There 's nobody on hand to examine your ticket when you arrive .
Parsing [sent. 3773 len. 16]: But the conductor will come and examine it when the train is ready to start .
Parsing [sent. 3774 len. 21]: It is too late to buy your extra ticket now ; the train ca n't wait , and wo n't .
Parsing [sent. 3775 len. 6]: You must climb out . ''
Parsing [sent. 3776 len. 10]: `` But ca n't I pay the conductor ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3777 len. 17]: `` No , he is not authorized to receive the money , and he wo n't .
Parsing [sent. 3778 len. 5]: You must climb out .
Parsing [sent. 3779 len. 6]: There 's no other way .
Parsing [sent. 3780 len. 24]: I tell you , the railway management is about the only thoroughly European thing here -- continentally European I mean , not English .
Parsing [sent. 3781 len. 11]: It 's the continental business in perfection ; down fine .
Parsing [sent. 3782 len. 13]: Oh , yes , even to the peanut-commerce of weighing baggage . ''
Parsing [sent. 3783 len. 8]: The train slowed up at his place .
Parsing [sent. 3784 len. 15]: As he stepped out he said : `` Yes , you 'll like Maryborough .
Parsing [sent. 3785 len. 5]: Plenty of intelligence there .
Parsing [sent. 3786 len. 14]: It 's a charming place -- with a hell of a hotel . ''
Parsing [sent. 3787 len. 5]: Then he was gone .
Parsing [sent. 3788 len. 16]: I turned to the other gentleman : `` Is your friend in the ministry ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3789 len. 8]: `` No -- studying for it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3790 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXXII .
Parsing [sent. 3791 len. 14]: The man with a new idea is a Crank until the idea succeeds .
Parsing [sent. 3792 len. 9]: -- Pudd ` nhead Wilson 's New Calendar .
Parsing [sent. 3793 len. 17]: It was Junior England all the way to Christchurch -- in fact , just a garden .
Parsing [sent. 3794 len. 38]: And Christchurch is an English town , with an English-park annex , and a winding English brook just like the Avon -- and named the Avon ; but from a man , not from Shakespeare 's river .
Parsing [sent. 3795 len. 23]: Its grassy banks are bordered by the stateliest and most impressive weeping willows to be found in the world , I suppose .
Parsing [sent. 3796 len. 26]: They continue the line of a great ancestor ; they were grown from sprouts of the willow that sheltered Napoleon 's grave in St. Helena .
Parsing [sent. 3797 len. 26]: It is a settled old community , with all the serenities , the graces , the conveniences , and the comforts of the ideal home-life .
Parsing [sent. 3798 len. 20]: If it had an established Church and social inequality it would be England over again with hardly a lack .
Parsing [sent. 3799 len. 42]: In the museum we saw many curious and interesting things ; among others a fine native house of the olden time , with all the details true to the facts , and the showy colors right and in their proper places .
Parsing [sent. 3800 len. 141]: All the details : the fine mats and rugs and things ; the elaborate and wonderful wood carvings -- wonderful , surely , considering who did them -- wonderful in design and particularly in execution , for they were done with admirable sharpness and exactness , and yet with no better tools than flint and jade and shell could furnish ; and the totem-posts were there , ancestor above ancestor , with tongues protruded and hands clasped comfortably over bellies containing other people 's ancestors -- grotesque and ugly devils , every one , but lovingly carved , and ably ; and the stuffed natives were present , in their proper places , and looking as natural as life ; and the housekeeping utensils were there , too , and close at hand the carved and finely ornamented war canoe .
Parsing [sent. 3801 len. 27]: And we saw little jade gods , to hang around the neck -- not everybody 's , but sacred to the necks of natives of rank .
Parsing [sent. 3802 len. 28]: Also jade weapons , and many kinds of jade trinkets -- all made out of that excessively hard stone without the help of any tool of iron .
Parsing [sent. 3803 len. 27]: And some of these things had small round holes bored through them -- nobody knows how it was done ; a mystery , a lost art .
Parsing [sent. 3804 len. 33]: I think it was said that if you want such a hole bored in a piece of jade now , you must send it to London or Amsterdam where the lapidaries are .
Parsing [sent. 3805 len. 11]: Also we saw a complete skeleton of the giant Moa .
Parsing [sent. 3806 len. 22]: It stood ten feet high , and must have been a sight to look at when it was a living bird .
Parsing [sent. 3807 len. 22]: It was a kicker , like the ostrich ; in fight it did not use its beak , but its foot .
Parsing [sent. 3808 len. 10]: It must have been a convincing kind of kick .
Parsing [sent. 3809 len. 31]: If a person had his back to the bird and did not see who it was that did it , he would think he had been kicked by a wind-mill .
Parsing [sent. 3810 len. 20]: There must have been a sufficiency of moas in the old forgotten days when his breed walked the earth .
Parsing [sent. 3811 len. 15]: His bones are found in vast masses , all crammed together in huge graves .
Parsing [sent. 3812 len. 11]: They are not in caves , but in the ground .
Parsing [sent. 3813 len. 10]: Nobody knows how they happened to get concentrated there .
Parsing [sent. 3814 len. 9]: Mind , they are bones , not fossils .
Parsing [sent. 3815 len. 12]: This means that the moa has not been extinct very long .
Parsing [sent. 3816 len. 23]: Still , this is the only New Zealand creature which has no mention in that otherwise comprehensive literature , the native legends .
Parsing [sent. 3817 len. 41]: This is a significant detail , and is good circumstantial evidence that the moa has been extinct 500 years , since the Maori has himself -- by tradition -- been in New Zealand since the end of the fifteenth century .
Parsing [sent. 3818 len. 41]: He came from an unknown land -- the first Maori did -- then sailed back in his canoe and brought his tribe , and they removed the aboriginal peoples into the sea and into the ground and took the land .
Parsing [sent. 3819 len. 5]: That is the tradition .
Parsing [sent. 3820 len. 49]: That that first Maori could come , is understandable , for anybody can come to a place when he is n't trying to ; but how that discoverer found his way back home again without a compass is his secret , and he died with it in him .
Parsing [sent. 3821 len. 9]: His language indicates that he came from Polynesia .
Parsing [sent. 3822 len. 48]: He told where he came from , but he could n't spell well , so one ca n't find the place on the map , because people who could spell better than he could , spelt the resemblance all out of it when they made the map .
Parsing [sent. 3823 len. 21]: However , it is better to have a map that is spelt right than one that has information in it .
Parsing [sent. 3824 len. 23]: In New Zealand women have the right to vote for members of the legislature , but they can not be members themselves .
Parsing [sent. 3825 len. 13]: The law extending the suffrage to them went into effect in 1893 .
Parsing [sent. 3826 len. 12]: The population of Christchurch -LRB- census of 1891 -RRB- was 31,454 .
Parsing [sent. 3827 len. 14]: The first election under the law was held in November of that year .
Parsing [sent. 3828 len. 16]: Number of men who voted , 6,313 ; number of women who voted , 5,989 .
Parsing [sent. 3829 len. 22]: These figures ought to convince us that women are not as indifferent about politics as some people would have us believe .
Parsing [sent. 3830 len. 30]: In New Zealand as a whole , the estimated adult female population was 139,915 ; of these 109,461 qualified and registered their names on the rolls 78.23 per cent .
Parsing [sent. 3831 len. 4]: of the whole .
Parsing [sent. 3832 len. 15]: Of these , 90,290 went to the polls and voted -- 85.18 per cent .
Parsing [sent. 3833 len. 14]: Do men ever turn out better than that -- in America or elsewhere ?
Parsing [sent. 3834 len. 36]: Here is a remark to the other sex 's credit , too -- I take it from the official report : `` A feature of the election was the orderliness and sobriety of the people .
Parsing [sent. 3835 len. 8]: Women were in no way molested . ''
Parsing [sent. 3836 len. 24]: At home , a standing argument against woman suffrage has always been that women could not go to the polls without being insulted .
Parsing [sent. 3837 len. 14]: The arguments against woman suffrage have always taken the easy form of prophecy .
Parsing [sent. 3838 len. 27]: The prophets have been prophesying ever since the woman 's rights movement began in 1848 -- and in forty-seven years they have never scored a hit .
Parsing [sent. 3839 len. 21]: Men ought to begin to feel a sort of respect for their mothers and wives and sisters by this time .
Parsing [sent. 3840 len. 16]: The women deserve a change of attitude like that , for they have wrought well .
Parsing [sent. 3841 len. 20]: In forty-seven years they have swept an imposingly large number of unfair laws from the statute books of America .
Parsing [sent. 3842 len. 13]: In that brief time these serfs have set themselves free -- essentially .
Parsing [sent. 3843 len. 32]: Men could not have done so much for themselves in that time without bloodshed -- at least they never have ; and that is argument that they did n't know how .
Parsing [sent. 3844 len. 38]: The women have accomplished a peaceful revolution , and a very beneficent one ; and yet that has not convinced the average man that they are intelligent , and have courage and energy and perseverance and fortitude .
Parsing [sent. 3845 len. 45]: It takes much to convince the average man of anything ; and perhaps nothing can ever make him realize that he is the average woman 's inferior -- yet in several important details the evidence seems to show that that is what he is .
Parsing [sent. 3846 len. 55]: Man has ruled the human race from the beginning -- but he should remember that up to the middle of the present century it was a dull world , and ignorant and stupid ; but it is not such a dull world now , and is growing less and less dull all the time .
Parsing [sent. 3847 len. 12]: This is woman 's opportunity -- she has had none before .
Parsing [sent. 3848 len. 11]: I wonder where man will be in another forty-seven years ?
Parsing [sent. 3849 len. 22]: In the New Zealand law occurs this : `` The word person wherever it occurs throughout the Act includes woman . ''
Parsing [sent. 3850 len. 7]: That is promotion , you see .
Parsing [sent. 3851 len. 32]: By that enlargement of the word , the matron with the garnered wisdom and experience of fifty years becomes at one jump the political equal of her callow kid of twenty-one .
Parsing [sent. 3852 len. 15]: The white population of the colony is 626,000 , the Maori population is 42,000 .
Parsing [sent. 3853 len. 15]: The whites elect seventy members of the House of Representatives , the Maoris four .
Parsing [sent. 3854 len. 9]: The Maori women vote for their four members .
Parsing [sent. 3855 len. 3]: November 16 .
Parsing [sent. 3856 len. 15]: After four pleasant days in Christchurch , we are to leave at midnight to-night .
Parsing [sent. 3857 len. 13]: Mr. Kinsey gave me an ornithorhynchus , and I am taming it .
Parsing [sent. 3858 len. 4]: Sunday , 17th .
Parsing [sent. 3859 len. 10]: Sailed last night in the Flora , from Lyttelton .
Parsing [sent. 3860 len. 4]: So we did .
Parsing [sent. 3861 len. 5]: I remember it yet .
Parsing [sent. 3862 len. 32]: The people who sailed in the Flora that night may forget some other things if they live a good while , but they will not live long enough to forget that .
Parsing [sent. 3863 len. 42]: The Flora is about the equivalent of a cattle-scow ; but when the Union Company find it inconvenient to keep a contract and lucrative to break it , they smuggle her into passenger service , and `` keep the change . ''
Parsing [sent. 3864 len. 38]: They give no notice of their projected depredation ; you innocently buy tickets for the advertised passenger boat , and when you get down to Lyttelton at midnight , you find that they have substituted the scow .
Parsing [sent. 3865 len. 17]: They have plenty of good boats , but no competition -- and that is the trouble .
Parsing [sent. 3866 len. 15]: It is too late now to make other arrangements if you have engagements ahead .
Parsing [sent. 3867 len. 53]: It is a powerful company , it has a monopoly , and everybody is afraid of it -- including the government 's representative , who stands at the end of the stage-plank to tally the passengers and see that no boat receives a greater number than the law allows her to carry .
Parsing [sent. 3868 len. 27]: This conveniently-blind representative saw the scow receive a number which was far in excess of its privilege , and winked a politic wink and said nothing .
Parsing [sent. 3869 len. 19]: The passengers bore with meekness the cheat which had been put upon them , and made no complaint .
Parsing [sent. 3870 len. 19]: It was like being at home in America , where abused passengers act in just the same way .
Parsing [sent. 3871 len. 81]: A few days before , the Union Company had discharged a captain for getting a boat into danger , and had advertised this act as evidence of its vigilance in looking after the safety of the passengers -- for thugging a captain costs the company nothing , but when opportunity offered to send this dangerously overcrowded tub to sea and save a little trouble and a tidy penny by it , it forgot to worry about the passenger 's safety .
Parsing [sent. 3872 len. 15]: The first officer told me that the Flora was privileged to carry 125 passengers .
Parsing [sent. 3873 len. 10]: She must have had all of 200 on board .
Parsing [sent. 3874 len. 76]: All the cabins were full , all the cattle-stalls in the main stable were full , the spaces at the heads of companionways were full , every inch of floor and table in the swill-room was packed with sleeping men and remained so until the place was required for breakfast , all the chairs and benches on the hurricane deck were occupied , and still there were people who had to walk about all night !
Parsing [sent. 3875 len. 24]: If the Flora had gone down that night , half of the people on board would have been wholly without means of escape .
Parsing [sent. 3876 len. 23]: The owners of that boat were not technically guilty of conspiracy to commit murder , but they were morally guilty of it .
Parsing [sent. 3877 len. 48]: I had a cattle-stall in the main stable -- a cavern fitted up with a long double file of two-storied bunks , the files separated by a calico partition -- twenty men and boys on one side of it , twenty women and girls on the other .
Parsing [sent. 3878 len. 19]: The place was as dark as the soul of the Union Company , and smelt like a kennel .
Parsing [sent. 3879 len. 44]: When the vessel got out into the heavy seas and began to pitch and wallow , the cavern prisoners became immediately seasick , and then the peculiar results that ensued laid all my previous experiences of the kind well away in the shade .
Parsing [sent. 3880 len. 21]: And the wails , the groans , the cries , the shrieks , the strange ejaculations -- it was wonderful .
Parsing [sent. 3881 len. 47]: The women and children and some of the men and boys spent the night in that place , for they were too ill to leave it ; but the rest of us got up , by and by , and finished the night on the hurricane-deck .
Parsing [sent. 3882 len. 40]: That boat was the foulest I was ever in ; and the smell of the breakfast saloon when we threaded our way among the layers of steaming passengers stretched upon its floor and its tables was incomparable for efficiency .
Parsing [sent. 3883 len. 16]: A good many of us got ashore at the first way-port to seek another ship .
Parsing [sent. 3884 len. 44]: After a wait of three hours we got good rooms in the Mahinapua , a wee little bridal-parlor of a boat -- only 205 tons burthen ; clean and comfortable ; good service ; good beds ; good table , and no crowding .
Parsing [sent. 3885 len. 16]: The seas danced her about like a duck , but she was safe and capable .
Parsing [sent. 3886 len. 35]: Next morning early she went through the French Pass -- a narrow gateway of rock , between bold headlands -- so narrow , in fact , that it seemed no wider than a street .
Parsing [sent. 3887 len. 18]: The current tore through there like a mill-race , and the boat darted through like a telegram .
Parsing [sent. 3888 len. 41]: The passage was made in half a minute ; then we were in a wide place where noble vast eddies swept grandly round and round in shoal water , and I wondered what they would do with the little boat .
Parsing [sent. 3889 len. 8]: They did as they pleased with her .
Parsing [sent. 3890 len. 47]: They picked her up and flung her around like nothing and landed her gently on the solid , smooth bottom of sand -- so gently , indeed , that we barely felt her touch it , barely felt her quiver when she came to a standstill .
Parsing [sent. 3891 len. 28]: The water was as clear as glass , the sand on the bottom was vividly distinct , and the fishes seemed to be swimming about in nothing .
Parsing [sent. 3892 len. 21]: Fishing lines were brought out , but before we could bait the hooks the boat was off and away again .
Parsing [sent. 3893 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXXIII .
Parsing [sent. 3894 len. 9]: Let us be grateful to Adam our benefactor .
Parsing [sent. 3895 len. 23]: He cut us out of the `` blessing of idleness , '' and won for us the `` curse of labor . ''
Parsing [sent. 3896 len. 9]: -- Pudd ` nhead Wilson 's New Calendar .
Parsing [sent. 3897 len. 49]: We soon reached the town of Nelson , and spent the most of the day there , visiting acquaintances and driving with them about the garden -- the whole region is a garden , excepting the scene of the `` Maungatapu Murders , '' of thirty years ago .
Parsing [sent. 3898 len. 17]: That is a wild place -- wild and lonely ; an ideal place for a murder .
Parsing [sent. 3899 len. 15]: It is at the base of a vast , rugged , densely timbered mountain .
Parsing [sent. 3900 len. 49]: In the deep twilight of that forest solitude four desperate rascals -- Burgess , Sullivan , Levy , and Kelley -- ambushed themselves beside the mountain-trail to murder and rob four travelers -- Kempthorne , Mathieu , Dudley , and De Pontius , the latter a New Yorker .
Parsing [sent. 3901 len. 33]: A harmless old laboring man came wandering along , and as his presence was an embarrassment , they choked him , hid him , and then resumed their watch for the four .
Parsing [sent. 3902 len. 16]: They had to wait a while , but eventually everything turned out as they desired .
Parsing [sent. 3903 len. 14]: That dark episode is the one large event in the history of Nelson .
Parsing [sent. 3904 len. 7]: The fame of it traveled far .
Parsing [sent. 3905 len. 5]: Burgess made a confession .
Parsing [sent. 3906 len. 6]: It is a remarkable paper .
Parsing [sent. 3907 len. 20]: For brevity , succinctness , and concentration , it is perhaps without its peer in the literature of murder .
Parsing [sent. 3908 len. 70]: There are no waste words in it ; there is no obtrusion of matter not pertinent to the occasion , nor any departure from the dispassionate tone proper to a formal business statement -- for that is what it is : a business statement of a murder , by the chief engineer of it , or superintendent , or foreman , or whatever one may prefer to call him .
Parsing [sent. 3909 len. 16]: `` We were getting impatient , when we saw four men and a pack-horse coming .
Parsing [sent. 3910 len. 37]: I left my cover and had a look at the men , for Levy had told me that Mathieu was a small man and wore a large beard , and that it was a chestnut horse .
Parsing [sent. 3911 len. 9]: I said , ` Here they come . '
Parsing [sent. 3912 len. 22]: They were then a good distance away ; I took the caps off my gun , and put fresh ones on .
Parsing [sent. 3913 len. 28]: I said , ` You keep where you are , I 'll put them up , and you give me your gun while you tie them . '
Parsing [sent. 3914 len. 8]: It was arranged as I have described .
Parsing [sent. 3915 len. 20]: The men came ; they arrived within about fifteen yards when I stepped up and said , ` Stand !
Parsing [sent. 3916 len. 4]: bail up ! '
Parsing [sent. 3917 len. 9]: That means all of them to get together .
Parsing [sent. 3918 len. 34]: I made them fall back on the upper side of the road with their faces up the range , and Sullivan brought me his gun , and then tied their hands behind them .
Parsing [sent. 3919 len. 14]: The horse was very quiet all the time , he did not move .
Parsing [sent. 3920 len. 46]: When they were all tied , Sullivan took the horse up the hill , and put him in the bush ; he cut the rope and let the swags -- -LSB- A `` swag '' is a kit , a pack , small baggage . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 3921 len. 12]: -- fall on the ground , and then came to me .
Parsing [sent. 3922 len. 20]: We then marched the men down the incline to the creek ; the water at this time barely running .
Parsing [sent. 3923 len. 30]: Up this creek we took the men ; we went , I daresay , five or six hundred yards up it , which took us nearly half-an-hour to accomplish .
Parsing [sent. 3924 len. 34]: Then we turned to the right up the range ; we went , I daresay , one hundred and fifty yards from the creek , and there we sat down with the men .
Parsing [sent. 3925 len. 20]: I said to Sullivan , ` Put down your gun and search these men , ' which he did .
Parsing [sent. 3926 len. 11]: I asked them their several names ; they told me .
Parsing [sent. 3927 len. 10]: I asked them if they were expected at Nelson .
Parsing [sent. 3928 len. 7]: They said , ` No . '
Parsing [sent. 3929 len. 9]: If such their lives would have been spared .
Parsing [sent. 3930 len. 7]: In money we took L60 odd .
Parsing [sent. 3931 len. 10]: I said , ` Is this all you have ?
Parsing [sent. 3932 len. 7]: You had better tell me . '
Parsing [sent. 3933 len. 12]: Sullivan said , ` Here is a bag of gold . '
Parsing [sent. 3934 len. 10]: I said , ` What 's on that pack-horse ?
Parsing [sent. 3935 len. 6]: Is there any gold ? '
Parsing [sent. 3936 len. 25]: when Kempthorne said , ` Yes , my gold is in the portmanteau , and I trust you will not take it all . '
Parsing [sent. 3937 len. 35]: ` Well , ' I said , ` we must take you away one at a time , because the range is steep just here , and then we will let you go . '
Parsing [sent. 3938 len. 11]: They said , ` All right , ' most cheerfully .
Parsing [sent. 3939 len. 19]: We tied their feet , and took Dudley with us ; we went about sixty yards with him .
Parsing [sent. 3940 len. 6]: This was through a scrub .
Parsing [sent. 3941 len. 40]: It was arranged the night previously that it would be best to choke them , in case the report of the arms might be heard from the road , and if they were missed they never would be found .
Parsing [sent. 3942 len. 29]: So we tied a handkerchief over his eyes , when Sullivan took the sash off his waist , put it round his neck , and so strangled him .
Parsing [sent. 3943 len. 20]: Sullivan , after I had killed the old laboring man , found fault with the way he was choked .
Parsing [sent. 3944 len. 16]: He said , ` The next we do I 'll show you my way . '
Parsing [sent. 3945 len. 13]: I said , ' I have never done such a thing before .
Parsing [sent. 3946 len. 12]: I have shot a man , but never choked one . '
Parsing [sent. 3947 len. 17]: We returned to the others , when Kempthorne said , ` What noise was that ? '
Parsing [sent. 3948 len. 11]: I said it was caused by breaking through the scrub .
Parsing [sent. 3949 len. 15]: This was taking too much time , so it was agreed to shoot them .
Parsing [sent. 3950 len. 32]: With that I said , ` We 'll take you no further , but separate you , and then loose one of you , and he can relieve the others . '
Parsing [sent. 3951 len. 17]: So with that , Sullivan took De Pontius to the left of where Kempthorne was sitting .
Parsing [sent. 3952 len. 7]: I took Mathieu to the right .
Parsing [sent. 3953 len. 15]: I tied a strap round his legs , and shot him with a revolver .
Parsing [sent. 3954 len. 25]: He yelled , I ran from him with my gun in my hand , I sighted Kempthorne , who had risen to his feet .
Parsing [sent. 3955 len. 26]: I presented the gun , and shot him behind the right ear ; his life 's blood welled from him , and he died instantaneously .
Parsing [sent. 3956 len. 15]: Sullivan had shot De Pontius in the meantime , and then came to me .
Parsing [sent. 3957 len. 16]: I said , ` Look to Mathieu , ' indicating the spot where he lay .
Parsing [sent. 3958 len. 34]: He shortly returned and said , ' I had to `` chiv '' that fellow , he was not dead , ' a cant word , meaning that he had to stab him .
Parsing [sent. 3959 len. 14]: Returning to the road we passed where De Pontius lay and was dead .
Parsing [sent. 3960 len. 48]: Sullivan said , ` This is the digger , the others were all storekeepers ; this is the digger , let 's cover him up , for should the others be found , they 'll think he done it and sloped , ' meaning he had gone .
Parsing [sent. 3961 len. 16]: So with that we threw all the stones on him , and then left him .
Parsing [sent. 3962 len. 19]: This bloody work took nearly an hour and a half from the time we stopped the men . ''
Parsing [sent. 3963 len. 22]: Anyone who reads that confession will think that the man who wrote it was destitute of emotions , destitute of feeling .
Parsing [sent. 3964 len. 5]: That is partly true .
Parsing [sent. 3965 len. 23]: As regarded others he was plainly without feeling -- utterly cold and pitiless ; but as regarded himself the case was different .
Parsing [sent. 3966 len. 21]: While he cared nothing for the future of the murdered men , he cared a great deal for his own .
Parsing [sent. 3967 len. 14]: It makes one 's flesh creep to read the introduction to his confession .
Parsing [sent. 3968 len. 25]: The judge on the bench characterized it as `` scandalously blasphemous , '' and it certainly reads so , but Burgess meant no blasphemy .
Parsing [sent. 3969 len. 19]: He was merely a brute , and whatever he said or wrote was sure to expose the fact .
Parsing [sent. 3970 len. 28]: His redemption was a very real thing to him , and he was as jubilantly happy on the gallows as ever was Christian martyr at the stake .
Parsing [sent. 3971 len. 13]: We dwellers in this world are strangely made , and mysteriously circumstanced .
Parsing [sent. 3972 len. 26]: We have to suppose that the murdered men are lost , and that Burgess is saved ; but we can not suppress our natural regrets .
Parsing [sent. 3973 len. 19]: `` Written in my dungeon drear this 7th of August , in the year of Grace , 1866 .
Parsing [sent. 3974 len. 88]: To God be ascribed all power and glory in subduing the rebellious spirit of a most guilty wretch , who has been brought , through the instrumentality of a faithful follower of Christ , to see his wretched and guilty state , inasmuch as hitherto he has led an awful and wretched life , and through the assurance of this faithful soldier of Christ , he has been led and also believes that Christ will yet receive and cleanse him from all his deep-dyed and bloody sins .
Parsing [sent. 3975 len. 50]: I lie under the imputation which says , ` Come now and let us reason together , saith the Lord : though your sins be as scarlet , they shall be as white as snow ; though they be red like crimson , they shall be as wool . '
Parsing [sent. 3976 len. 7]: On this promise I rely . ''
Parsing [sent. 3977 len. 37]: We sailed in the afternoon late , spent a few hours at New Plymouth , then sailed again and reached Auckland the next day , November 20th , and remained in that fine city several days .
Parsing [sent. 3978 len. 11]: Its situation is commanding , and the sea-view is superb .
Parsing [sent. 3979 len. 19]: There are charming drives all about , and by courtesy of friends we had opportunity to enjoy them .
Parsing [sent. 3980 len. 73]: From the grassy crater-summit of Mount Eden one 's eye ranges over a grand sweep and variety of scenery -- forests clothed in luxuriant foliage , rolling green fields , conflagrations of flowers , receding and dimming stretches of green plain , broken by lofty and symmetrical old craters -- then the blue bays twinkling and sparkling away into the dreamy distances where the mountains loom spiritual in their veils of haze .
Parsing [sent. 3981 len. 40]: It is from Auckland that one goes to Rotorua , the region of the renowned hot lakes and geysers -- one of the chief wonders of New Zealand ; but I was not well enough to make the trip .
Parsing [sent. 3982 len. 18]: The government has a sanitorium there , and everything is comfortable for the tourist and the invalid .
Parsing [sent. 3983 len. 56]: The government 's official physician is almost over-cautious in his estimates of the efficacy of the baths , when he is talking about rheumatism , gout , paralysis , and such things ; but when he is talking about the effectiveness of the waters in eradicating the whisky-habit , he seems to have no reserves .
Parsing [sent. 3984 len. 30]: The baths will cure the drinking-habit no matter how chronic it is -- and cure it so effectually that even the desire to drink intoxicants will come no more .
Parsing [sent. 3985 len. 34]: There should be a rush from Europe and America to that place ; and when the victims of alcoholism find out what they can get by going there , the rush will begin .
Parsing [sent. 3986 len. 22]: The Thermal-springs District of New Zealand comprises an area of upwards of 600,000 acres , or close on 1,000 square miles .
Parsing [sent. 3987 len. 6]: Rotorua is the favorite place .
Parsing [sent. 3988 len. 24]: It is the center of a rich field of lake and mountain scenery ; from Rotorua as a base the pleasure-seeker makes excursions .
Parsing [sent. 3989 len. 11]: The crowd of sick people is great , and growing .
Parsing [sent. 3990 len. 7]: Rotorua is the Carlsbad of Australasia .
Parsing [sent. 3991 len. 11]: It is from Auckland that the Kauri gum is shipped .
Parsing [sent. 3992 len. 19]: For a long time now about 8,000 tons of it have been brought into the town per year .
Parsing [sent. 3993 len. 22]: It is worth about $ 300 per ton , unassorted ; assorted , the finest grades are worth about $ 1,000 .
Parsing [sent. 3994 len. 7]: It goes to America , chiefly .
Parsing [sent. 3995 len. 31]: It is in lumps , and is hard and smooth , and looks like amber -- the light-colored like new amber , and the dark brown like rich old amber .
Parsing [sent. 3996 len. 11]: And it has the pleasant feel of amber , too .
Parsing [sent. 3997 len. 26]: Some of the light-colored samples were a tolerably fair counterfeit of uncut South African diamonds , they were so perfectly smooth and polished and transparent .
Parsing [sent. 3998 len. 17]: It is manufactured into varnish ; a varnish which answers for copal varnish and is cheaper .
Parsing [sent. 3999 len. 17]: The gum is dug up out of the ground ; it has been there for ages .
Parsing [sent. 4000 len. 9]: It is the sap of the Kauri tree .
Parsing [sent. 4001 len. 25]: Dr. Campbell of Auckland told me he sent a cargo of it to England fifty years ago , but nothing came of the venture .
Parsing [sent. 4002 len. 22]: Nobody knew what to do with it ; so it was sold at L5 a ton , to light fires with .
Parsing [sent. 4003 len. 8]: November 26 -- 3 P.M. , sailed .
Parsing [sent. 4004 len. 5]: Vast and beautiful harbor .

Parsing [sent. 4006 len. 17]: Tangariwa , the mountain that `` has the same shape from every point of view . ''
Parsing [sent. 4007 len. 8]: That is the common belief in Auckland .
Parsing [sent. 4008 len. 13]: And so it has -- from every point of view except thirteen .
Parsing [sent. 4009 len. 4]: Perfect summer weather .
Parsing [sent. 4010 len. 8]: Large school of whales in the distance .
Parsing [sent. 4011 len. 46]: Nothing could be daintier than the puffs of vapor they spout up , when seen against the pink glory of the sinking sun , or against the dark mass of an island reposing in the deep blue shadow of a storm cloud . . . .
Parsing [sent. 4012 len. 14]: Great Barrier rock standing up out of the sea away to the left .
Parsing [sent. 4013 len. 32]: Sometime ago a ship hit it full speed in a fog -- 20 miles out of her course -- 140 lives lost ; the captain committed suicide without waiting a moment .
Parsing [sent. 4014 len. 47]: He knew that , whether he was to blame or not , the company owning the vessel would discharge him and make a devotion -- to -- passengers ' safety advertisement out of it , and his chance to make a livelihood would be permanently gone .

Parsing [sent. 4018 len. 9]: -- Pudd ` nhead Wilson 's New Calendar .
Parsing [sent. 4019 len. 3]: November 27 .
Parsing [sent. 4020 len. 25]: To-day we reached Gisborne , and anchored in a big bay ; there was a heavy sea on , so we remained on board .
Parsing [sent. 4021 len. 105]: We were a mile from shore ; a little steam-tug put out from the land ; she was an object of thrilling interest ; she would climb to the summit of a billow , reel drunkenly there a moment , dim and gray in the driving storm of spindrift , then make a plunge like a diver and remain out of sight until one had given her up , then up she would dart again , on a steep slant toward the sky , shedding Niagaras of water from her forecastle -- and this she kept up , all the way out to us .
Parsing [sent. 4022 len. 18]: She brought twenty-five passengers in her stomach -- men and women -- mainly a traveling dramatic company .
Parsing [sent. 4023 len. 24]: In sight on deck were the crew , in sou ` westers , yellow waterproof canvas suits , and boots to the thigh .
Parsing [sent. 4024 len. 30]: The deck was never quiet for a moment , and seldom nearer level than a ladder , and noble were the seas which leapt aboard and went flooding aft .
Parsing [sent. 4025 len. 58]: We rove a long line to the yard-arm , hung a most primitive basketchair to it and swung it out into the spacious air of heaven , and there it swayed , pendulum-fashion , waiting for its chance -- then down it shot , skillfully aimed , and was grabbed by the two men on the forecastle .
Parsing [sent. 4026 len. 20]: A young fellow belonging to our crew was in the chair , to be a protection to the lady-comers .
Parsing [sent. 4027 len. 53]: At once a couple of ladies appeared from below , took seats in his lap , we hoisted them into the sky , waited a moment till the roll of the ship brought them in overhead , then we lowered suddenly away , and seized the chair as it struck the deck .
Parsing [sent. 4028 len. 29]: We took the twenty-five aboard , and delivered twenty-five into the tug -- among them several aged ladies , and one blind one -- and all without accident .
Parsing [sent. 4029 len. 8]: It was a fine piece of work .
Parsing [sent. 4030 len. 15]: Ours is a nice ship , roomy , comfortable , well-ordered , and satisfactory .
Parsing [sent. 4031 len. 44]: Now and then we step on a rat in a hotel , but we have had no rats on shipboard lately ; unless , perhaps in the Flora ; we had more serious things to think of there , and did not notice .
Parsing [sent. 4032 len. 24]: I have noticed that it is only in ships and hotels which still employ the odious Chinese gong , that you find rats .
Parsing [sent. 4033 len. 37]: The reason would seem to be , that as a rat can not tell the time of day by a clock , he wo n't stay where he can not find out when dinner is ready .
Parsing [sent. 4034 len. 3]: November 29 .
Parsing [sent. 4035 len. 38]: The doctor tells me of several old drunkards , one spiritless loafer , and several far-gone moral wrecks who have been reclaimed by the Salvation Army and have remained staunch people and hard workers these two years .
Parsing [sent. 4036 len. 17]: Wherever one goes , these testimonials to the Army 's efficiency are forthcoming . . . .
Parsing [sent. 4037 len. 31]: This morning we had one of those whizzing green Ballarat flies in the room , with his stunning buzz-saw noise -- the swiftest creature in the world except the lightning-flash .
Parsing [sent. 4038 len. 14]: It is a stupendous force that is stored up in that little body .
Parsing [sent. 4039 len. 35]: If we had it in a ship in the same proportion , we could spin from Liverpool to New York in the space of an hour -- the time it takes to eat luncheon .
Parsing [sent. 4040 len. 14]: The New Zealand express train is called the Ballarat Fly . . . .
Parsing [sent. 4041 len. 6]: Bad teeth in the colonies .
Parsing [sent. 4042 len. 36]: A citizen told me they do n't have teeth filled , but pull them out and put in false ones , and that now and then one sees a young lady with a full set .
Parsing [sent. 4043 len. 4]: She is fortunate .
Parsing [sent. 4044 len. 17]: I wish I had been born with false teeth and a false liver and false carbuncles .
Parsing [sent. 4045 len. 6]: I should get along better .
Parsing [sent. 4046 len. 3]: December 2 .
Parsing [sent. 4047 len. 2]: Monday .
Parsing [sent. 4048 len. 14]: Left Napier in the Ballarat Fly the one that goes twice a week .
Parsing [sent. 4049 len. 26]: From Napier to Hastings , twelve miles ; time , fifty-five minutes -- not so far short of thirteen miles an hour . . . .
Parsing [sent. 4050 len. 14]: A perfect summer day ; cool breeze , brilliant sky , rich vegetation .
Parsing [sent. 4051 len. 41]: Two or three times during the afternoon we saw wonderfully dense and beautiful forests , tumultuously piled skyward on the broken highlands -- not the customary roof-like slant of a hillside , where the trees are all the same height .
Parsing [sent. 4052 len. 37]: The noblest of these trees were of the Kauri breed , we were told -- the timber that is now furnishing the wood-paving for Europe , and is the best of all wood for that purpose .
Parsing [sent. 4053 len. 43]: Sometimes these towering upheavals of forestry were festooned and garlanded with vine-cables , and sometimes the masses of undergrowth were cocooned in another sort of vine of a delicate cobwebby texture -- they call it the `` supplejack , '' I think .
Parsing [sent. 4054 len. 26]: Tree ferns everywhere -- a stem fifteen feet high , with a graceful chalice of fern-fronds sprouting from its top -- a lovely forest ornament .
Parsing [sent. 4055 len. 22]: And there was a ten-foot reed with a flowing suit of what looked like yellow hair hanging from its upper end .
Parsing [sent. 4056 len. 22]: I do not know its name , but if there is such a thing as a scalp-plant , this is it .
Parsing [sent. 4057 len. 16]: A romantic gorge , with a brook flowing in its bottom , approaching Palmerston North .
Parsing [sent. 4058 len. 2]: Waitukurau .
Parsing [sent. 4059 len. 5]: Twenty minutes for luncheon .
Parsing [sent. 4060 len. 16]: With me sat my wife and daughter , and my manager , Mr. Carlyle Smythe .
Parsing [sent. 4061 len. 24]: I sat at the head of the table , and could see the right-hand wall ; the others had their backs to it .
Parsing [sent. 4062 len. 17]: On that wall , at a good distance away , were a couple of framed pictures .
Parsing [sent. 4063 len. 33]: I could not see them clearly , but from the groupings of the figures I fancied that they represented the killing of Napoleon III 's son by the Zulus in South Africa .
Parsing [sent. 4064 len. 42]: I broke into the conversation , which was about poetry and cabbage and art , and said to my wife -- `` Do you remember when the news came to Paris -- '' `` Of the killing of the Prince ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4065 len. 13]: -LRB- Those were the very words I had in my mind . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 4066 len. 8]: `` Yes , but what Prince ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4067 len. 3]: `` Napoleon .
Parsing [sent. 4068 len. 3]: Lulu . ''
Parsing [sent. 4069 len. 9]: `` What made you think of that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4070 len. 7]: `` I do n't know . ''
Parsing [sent. 4071 len. 5]: There was no collusion .
Parsing [sent. 4072 len. 14]: She had not seen the pictures , and they had not been mentioned .
Parsing [sent. 4073 len. 58]: She ought to have thought of some recent news that came to Paris , for we were but seven months from there and had been living there a couple of years when we started on this trip ; but instead of that she thought of an incident of our brief sojourn in Paris of sixteen years before .
Parsing [sent. 4074 len. 21]: Here was a clear case of mental telegraphy ; of mind-transference ; of my mind telegraphing a thought into hers .
Parsing [sent. 4075 len. 5]: How do I know ?
Parsing [sent. 4076 len. 6]: Because I telegraphed an error .
Parsing [sent. 4077 len. 23]: For it turned out that the pictures did not represent the killing of Lulu at all , nor anything connected with Lulu .
Parsing [sent. 4078 len. 15]: She had to get the error from my head -- it existed nowhere else .

Parsing [sent. 4083 len. 10]: A pleasant trip , yesterday , per Ballarat Fly .
Parsing [sent. 4084 len. 3]: Four hours .
Parsing [sent. 4085 len. 18]: I do not know the distance , but it must have been well along toward fifty miles .
Parsing [sent. 4086 len. 58]: The Fly could have spun it out to eight hours and not discommoded me ; for where there is comfort , and no need for hurry , speed is of no value -- at least to me ; and nothing that goes on wheels can be more comfortable , more satisfactory , than the New Zealand trains .
Parsing [sent. 4087 len. 13]: Outside of America there are no cars that are so rationally devised .
Parsing [sent. 4088 len. 34]: When you add the constant presence of charming scenery and the nearly constant absence of dust -- well , if one is not content then , he ought to get out and walk .
Parsing [sent. 4089 len. 8]: That would change his spirit , perhaps ?
Parsing [sent. 4090 len. 4]: I think so .
Parsing [sent. 4091 len. 24]: At the end of an hour you would find him waiting humbly beside the track , and glad to be taken aboard again .
Parsing [sent. 4092 len. 42]: Much horseback riding , in and around this town ; many comely girls in cool and pretty summer gowns ; much Salvation Army ; lots of Maoris ; the faces and bodies of some of the old ones very tastefully frescoed .
Parsing [sent. 4093 len. 29]: Maori Council House over the river -- large , strong , carpeted from end to end with matting , and decorated with elaborate wood carvings , artistically executed .
Parsing [sent. 4094 len. 6]: The Maoris were very polite .
Parsing [sent. 4095 len. 24]: I was assured by a member of the House of Representatives that the native race is not decreasing , but actually increasing slightly .
Parsing [sent. 4096 len. 13]: It is another evidence that they are a superior breed of savages .
Parsing [sent. 4097 len. 47]: I do not call to mind any savage race that built such good houses , or such strong and ingenious and scientific fortresses , or gave so much attention to agriculture , or had military arts and devices which so nearly approached the white man 's .
Parsing [sent. 4098 len. 35]: These , taken together with their high abilities in boat-building , and their tastes and capacities in the ornamental arts modify their savagery to a semi-civilization -- or at least to , a quarter-civilization .
Parsing [sent. 4099 len. 38]: It is a compliment to them that the British did not exterminate them , as they did the Australians and the Tasmanians , but were content with subduing them , and showed no desire to go further .
Parsing [sent. 4100 len. 52]: And it is another compliment to them that the British did not take the whole of their choicest lands , but left them a considerable part , and then went further and protected them from the rapacities of landsharks -- a protection which the New Zealand Government still extends to them .
Parsing [sent. 4101 len. 31]: And it is still another compliment to the Maoris that the Government allows native representation -- in both the legislature and the cabinet , and gives both sexes the vote .
Parsing [sent. 4102 len. 32]: And in doing these things the Government also compliments itself ; it has not been the custom of the world for conquerors to act in this large spirit toward the conquered .
Parsing [sent. 4103 len. 27]: The highest class white men who lived among the Maoris in the earliest time had a high opinion of them and a strong affection for them .
Parsing [sent. 4104 len. 24]: Among the whites of this sort was the author of `` Old New Zealand ; '' and Dr. Campbell of Auckland was another .
Parsing [sent. 4105 len. 28]: Dr. Campbell was a close friend of several chiefs , and has many pleasant things to say of their fidelity , their magnanimity , and their generosity .
Parsing [sent. 4106 len. 21]: Also of their quaint notions about the white man 's queer civilization , and their equally quaint comments upon it .
Parsing [sent. 4107 len. 16]: One of them thought the missionary had got everything wrong end first and upside down .
Parsing [sent. 4108 len. 25]: `` Why , he wants us to stop worshiping and supplicating the evil gods , and go to worshiping and supplicating the Good One !
Parsing [sent. 4109 len. 7]: There is no sense in that .
Parsing [sent. 4110 len. 13]: A good god is not going to do us any harm . ''
Parsing [sent. 4111 len. 18]: The Maoris had the tabu ; and had it on a Polynesian scale of comprehensiveness and elaboration .
Parsing [sent. 4112 len. 13]: Some of its features could have been importations from India and Judea .
Parsing [sent. 4113 len. 69]: Neither the Maori nor the Hindoo of common degree could cook by a fire that a person of higher caste had used , nor could the high Maori or high Hindoo employ fire that had served a man of low grade ; if a low-grade Maori or Hindoo drank from a vessel belonging to a high-grade man , the vessel was defiled , and had to be destroyed .
Parsing [sent. 4114 len. 11]: There were other resemblances between Maori tabu and Hindoo caste-custom .
Parsing [sent. 4115 len. 36]: Yesterday a lunatic burst into my quarters and warned me that the Jesuits were going to `` cook '' -LRB- poison -RRB- me in my food , or kill me on the stage at night .
Parsing [sent. 4116 len. 15]: He said a mysterious sign was visible upon my posters and meant my death .
Parsing [sent. 4117 len. 38]: He said he saved Rev. Mr. Haweis 's life by warning him that there were three men on his platform who would kill him if he took his eyes off them for a moment during his lecture .
Parsing [sent. 4118 len. 18]: The same men were in my audience last night , but they saw that he was there .
Parsing [sent. 4119 len. 9]: `` Will they be there again to-night ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4120 len. 20]: He hesitated ; then said no , he thought they would rather take a rest and chance the poison .
Parsing [sent. 4121 len. 6]: This lunatic has no delicacy .
Parsing [sent. 4122 len. 6]: But he was not uninteresting .
Parsing [sent. 4123 len. 8]: He told me a lot of things .
Parsing [sent. 4124 len. 22]: He said he had `` saved so many lecturers in twenty years , that they put him in the asylum . ''
Parsing [sent. 4125 len. 13]: I think he has less refinement than any lunatic I have met .

Parsing [sent. 4130 len. 78]: We Americans are English in blood , English in speech , English in religion , English in the essentials of our governmental system , English in the essentials of our civilization ; and so , let us hope , for the honor of the blend , for the honor of the blood , for the honor of the race , that that word got there through lack of heedfulness , and will not be suffered to remain .
Parsing [sent. 4131 len. 48]: If you carve it at Thermopylae , or where Winkelried died , or upon Bunker Hill monument , and read it again `` who fell in defence of law and order against fanaticism '' you will perceive what the word means , and how mischosen it is .
Parsing [sent. 4132 len. 4]: Patriotism is Patriotism .
Parsing [sent. 4133 len. 13]: Calling it Fanaticism can not degrade it ; nothing can degrade it .
Parsing [sent. 4134 len. 47]: Even though it be a political mistake , and a thousand times a political mistake , that does not affect it ; it is honorabl -- always honorable , always noble -- and privileged to hold its head up and look the nations in the face .
Parsing [sent. 4135 len. 61]: It is right to praise these brave white men who fell in the Maori war -- they deserve it ; but the presence of that word detracts from the dignity of their cause and their deeds , and makes them appear to have spilt their blood in a conflict with ignoble men , men not worthy of that costly sacrifice .
Parsing [sent. 4136 len. 6]: But the men were worthy .
Parsing [sent. 4137 len. 8]: It was no shame to fight them .
Parsing [sent. 4138 len. 66]: They fought for their homes , they fought for their country ; they bravely fought and bravely fell ; and it would take nothing from the honor of the brave Englishmen who lie under the monument , but add to it , to say that they died in defense of English laws and English homes against men worthy of the sacrifice -- the Maori patriots .
Parsing [sent. 4139 len. 8]: The other monument can not be rectified .
Parsing [sent. 4140 len. 4]: Except with dynamite .
Parsing [sent. 4141 len. 13]: It is a mistake all through , and a strangely thoughtless one .
Parsing [sent. 4142 len. 27]: It is a monument erected by white men to Maoris who fell fighting with the whites and against their own people , in the Maori war .
Parsing [sent. 4143 len. 22]: `` Sacred to the memory of the brave men who fell on the 14th of May , 1864 , '' etc. .
Parsing [sent. 4144 len. 11]: On one side are the names of about twenty Maoris .
Parsing [sent. 4145 len. 12]: It is not a fancy of mine ; the monument exists .
Parsing [sent. 4146 len. 4]: I saw it .
Parsing [sent. 4147 len. 9]: It is an object-lesson to the rising generation .
Parsing [sent. 4148 len. 9]: It invites to treachery , disloyalty , unpatriotism .
Parsing [sent. 4149 len. 30]: Its lesson , in frank terms is , `` Desert your flag , slay your people , burn their homes , shame your nationality -- we honor such . ''
Parsing [sent. 4150 len. 3]: December 9 .
Parsing [sent. 4151 len. 2]: Wellington .
Parsing [sent. 4152 len. 8]: Ten hours from Wanganui by the Fly .
Parsing [sent. 4153 len. 3]: December 12 .
Parsing [sent. 4154 len. 9]: It is a fine city and nobly situated .
Parsing [sent. 4155 len. 11]: A busy place , and full of life and movement .
Parsing [sent. 4156 len. 36]: Have spent the three days partly in walking about , partly in enjoying social privileges , and largely in idling around the magnificent garden at Hutt , a little distance away , around the shore .
Parsing [sent. 4157 len. 11]: I suppose we shall not see such another one soon .
Parsing [sent. 4158 len. 10]: We are packing to-night for the return-voyage to Australia .
Parsing [sent. 4159 len. 26]: Our stay in New Zealand has been too brief ; still , we are not unthankful for the glimpse which we have had of it .
Parsing [sent. 4160 len. 15]: The sturdy Maoris made the settlement of the country by the whites rather difficult .
Parsing [sent. 4161 len. 7]: Not at first -- but later .
Parsing [sent. 4162 len. 39]: At first they welcomed the whites , and were eager to trade with them -- particularly for muskets ; for their pastime was internecine war , and they greatly preferred the white man 's weapons to their own .
Parsing [sent. 4163 len. 11]: War was their pastime -- I use the word advisedly .
Parsing [sent. 4164 len. 19]: They often met and slaughtered each other just for a lark , and when there was no quarrel .
Parsing [sent. 4165 len. 51]: The author of `` Old New Zealand '' mentions a case where a victorious army could have followed up its advantage and exterminated the opposing army , but declined to do it ; explaining naively that `` if we did that , there could n't be any more fighting . ''
Parsing [sent. 4166 len. 28]: In another battle one army sent word that it was out of ammunition , and would be obliged to stop unless the opposing army would send some .
Parsing [sent. 4167 len. 10]: It was sent , and the fight went on .
Parsing [sent. 4168 len. 9]: In the early days things went well enough .
Parsing [sent. 4169 len. 29]: The natives sold land without clearly understanding the terms of exchange , and the whites bought it without being much disturbed about the native 's confusion of mind .
Parsing [sent. 4170 len. 38]: But by and by the Maori began to comprehend that he was being wronged ; then there was trouble , for he was not the man to swallow a wrong and go aside and cry about it .
Parsing [sent. 4171 len. 53]: He had the Tasmanian 's spirit and endurance , and a notable share of military science besides ; and so he rose against the oppressor , did this gallant `` fanatic , '' and started a war that was not brought to a definite end until more than a generation had sped .
Parsing [sent. 4172 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXXVI .
Parsing [sent. 4173 len. 14]: There are several good protections against temptations , but the surest is cowardice .
Parsing [sent. 4174 len. 9]: -- Pudd ` nhead Wilson 's New Calendar .
Parsing [sent. 4175 len. 8]: Names are not always what they seem .
Parsing [sent. 4176 len. 9]: The common Welsh name Bzjxxllwep is pronounced Jackson .
Parsing [sent. 4177 len. 9]: -- Pudd ` nhead Wilson 's New Calendar .
Parsing [sent. 4178 len. 5]: Friday , December 13 .
Parsing [sent. 4179 len. 12]: Sailed , at 3 p.m. , in the ` Mararoa ' .
Parsing [sent. 4180 len. 12]: Summer seas and a good ship -- life has nothing better .
Parsing [sent. 4181 len. 2]: Monday .
Parsing [sent. 4182 len. 5]: Three days of paradise .
Parsing [sent. 4183 len. 16]: Warm and sunny and smooth ; the sea a luminous Mediterranean blue . . . .
Parsing [sent. 4184 len. 20]: One lolls in a long chair all day under deck-awnings , and reads and smokes , in measureless content .
Parsing [sent. 4185 len. 13]: One does not read prose at such a time , but poetry .
Parsing [sent. 4186 len. 47]: I have been reading the poems of Mrs. Julia A. Moore , again , and I find in them the same grace and melody that attracted me when they were first published , twenty years ago , and have held me in happy bonds ever since .
Parsing [sent. 4187 len. 28]: `` The Sentimental Song Book '' has long been out of print , and has been forgotten by the world in general , but not by me .
Parsing [sent. 4188 len. 14]: I carry it with me always -- it and Goldsmith 's deathless story .
Parsing [sent. 4189 len. 43]: Indeed , it has the same deep charm for me that the Vicar of Wakefield has , and I find in it the same subtle touch -- the touch that makes an intentionally humorous episode pathetic and an intentionally pathetic one funny .
Parsing [sent. 4190 len. 23]: In her time Mrs. Moore was called `` the Sweet Singer of Michigan , '' and was best known by that name .
Parsing [sent. 4191 len. 46]: I have read her book through twice today , with the purpose of determining which of her pieces has most merit , and I am persuaded that for wide grasp and sustained power , `` William Upson '' may claim first place : WILLIAM UPSON .
Parsing [sent. 4192 len. 10]: Air -- `` The Major 's Only Son . ''
Parsing [sent. 4193 len. 36]: Come all good people far and near , Oh , come and see what you can hear , It 's of a young man true and brave , That is now sleeping in his grave .
Parsing [sent. 4194 len. 35]: Now , William Upson was his name If it 's not that , it 's all the same He did enlist in a cruel strife , And it caused him to lose his life .
Parsing [sent. 4195 len. 30]: He was Perry Upson 's eldest son , His father loved his noble son , This son was nineteen years of age When first in the rebellion he engaged .
Parsing [sent. 4196 len. 19]: His father said that he might go , But his dear mother she said no , `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 4197 len. 19]: stay at home , dear Billy , '' she said , But she could not turn his head .
Parsing [sent. 4198 len. 35]: He went to Nashville , in Tennessee , There his kind friends he could not see ; He died among strangers , so far away , They did not know where his body lay .
Parsing [sent. 4199 len. 12]: He was taken sick and lived four weeks , And Oh !
Parsing [sent. 4200 len. 22]: how his parents weep , But now they must in sorrow mourn , For Billy has gone to his heavenly home .
Parsing [sent. 4201 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 4202 len. 37]: if his mother could have seen her son , For she loved him , her darling son ; If she could heard his dying prayer , It would ease her heart till she met him there .
Parsing [sent. 4203 len. 34]: How it would relieve his mother 's heart To see her son from this world depart , And hear his noble words of love , As he left this world for that above .
Parsing [sent. 4204 len. 36]: Now it will relieve his mother 's heart , For her son is laid in our graveyard ; For now she knows that his grave is near , She will not shed so many tears .
Parsing [sent. 4205 len. 34]: Although she knows not that it was her son , For his coffin could not be opened It might be someone in his place , For she could not see his noble face .
Parsing [sent. 4206 len. 4]: December , 17 .
Parsing [sent. 4207 len. 3]: Reached Sydney .
Parsing [sent. 4208 len. 4]: December , 19 .
Parsing [sent. 4209 len. 4]: In the train .
Parsing [sent. 4210 len. 23]: Fellow of 30 with four valises ; a slim creature , with teeth which made his mouth look like a neglected churchyard .
Parsing [sent. 4211 len. 15]: He had solidified hair -- solidified with pomatum ; it was all one shell .
Parsing [sent. 4212 len. 16]: He smoked the most extraordinary cigarettes -- made of some kind of manure , apparently .
Parsing [sent. 4213 len. 12]: These and his hair made him smell like the very nation .
Parsing [sent. 4214 len. 19]: He had a low-cut vest on , which exposed a deal of frayed and broken and unclean shirtfront .
Parsing [sent. 4215 len. 16]: Showy studs , of imitation gold -- they had made black disks on the linen .
Parsing [sent. 4216 len. 13]: Oversized sleeve buttons of imitation gold , the copper base showing through .
Parsing [sent. 4217 len. 6]: Ponderous watch-chain of imitation gold .
Parsing [sent. 4218 len. 23]: I judge that he could n't tell the time by it , for he asked Smythe what time it was , once .
Parsing [sent. 4219 len. 41]: He wore a coat which had been gay when it was young ; 5-o'clock-tea-trousers of a light tint , and marvelously soiled ; yellow mustache with a dashing upward whirl at the ends ; foxy shoes , imitation patent leather .
Parsing [sent. 4220 len. 9]: He was a novelty -- an imitation dude .
Parsing [sent. 4221 len. 14]: He would have been a real one if he could have afforded it .
Parsing [sent. 4222 len. 7]: But he was satisfied with himself .
Parsing [sent. 4223 len. 16]: You could see it in his expression , and in all his attitudes and movements .
Parsing [sent. 4224 len. 20]: He was living in a dude dreamland where all his squalid shams were genuine , and himself a sincerity .
Parsing [sent. 4225 len. 33]: It disarmed criticism , it mollified spite , to see him so enjoy his imitation languors , and arts , and airs , and his studied daintinesses of gesture and misbegotten refinements .
Parsing [sent. 4226 len. 29]: It was plain to me that he was imagining himself the Prince of Wales , and was doing everything the way he thought the Prince would do it .
Parsing [sent. 4227 len. 41]: For bringing his four valises aboard and stowing them in the nettings , he gave his porter four cents , and lightly apologized for the smallness of the gratuity -- just with the condescendingest little royal air in the world .
Parsing [sent. 4228 len. 108]: He stretched himself out on the front seat and rested his pomatum-cake on the middle arm , and stuck his feet out of the window , and began to pose as the Prince and work his dreams and languors for exhibition ; and he would indolently watch the blue films curling up from his cigarette , and inhale the stench , and look so grateful ; and would flip the ash away with the daintiest gesture , unintentionally displaying his brass ring in the most intentional way ; why , it was as good as being in Marlborough House itself to see him do it so like .
Parsing [sent. 4229 len. 8]: There was other scenery in the trip .
Parsing [sent. 4230 len. 51]: That of the Hawksbury river , in the National Park region , fine -- extraordinarily fine , with spacious views of stream and lake imposingly framed in woody hills ; and every now and then the noblest groupings of mountains , and the most enchanting rearrangements of the water effects .
Parsing [sent. 4231 len. 28]: Further along , green flats , thinly covered with gum forests , with here and there the huts and cabins of small farmers engaged in raising children .
Parsing [sent. 4232 len. 11]: Still further along , arid stretches , lifeless and melancholy .
Parsing [sent. 4233 len. 14]: Then Newcastle , a rushing town , capital of the rich coal regions .
Parsing [sent. 4234 len. 48]: Approaching Scone , wide farming and grazing levels , with pretty frequent glimpses of a troublesome plant -- a particularly devilish little prickly pear , daily damned in the orisons of the agriculturist ; imported by a lady of sentiment , and contributed gratis to the colony .
Parsing [sent. 4235 len. 6]: Blazing hot , all day .
Parsing [sent. 4236 len. 3]: December 20 .
Parsing [sent. 4237 len. 4]: Back to Sydney .
Parsing [sent. 4238 len. 4]: Blazing hot again .
Parsing [sent. 4239 len. 115]: From the newspaper , and from the map , I have made a collection of curious names of Australasian towns , with the idea of making a poem out of them : Tumut Takee Murriwillumba Bowral Ballarat Mullengudgery Murrurundi Wagga-Wagga Wyalong Murrumbidgee Goomeroo Wolloway Wangary Wanilla Worrow Koppio Yankalilla Yaranyacka Yackamoorundie Kaiwaka Coomooroo Tauranga Geelong Tongariro Kaikoura Wakatipu Oohipara Waitpinga Goelwa Munno Para Nangkita Myponga Kapunda Kooringa Penola Nangwarry Kongorong Comaum Koolywurtie Killanoola Naracoorte Muloowurtie Binnum Wallaroo Wirrega Mundoora Hauraki Rangiriri Teawamute Taranaki Toowoomba Goondiwindi Jerrilderie Whangaroa Wollongong Woolloomooloo Bombola Coolgardie Bendigo Coonamble Cootamundra Woolgoolga Mittagong Jamberoo Kondoparinga Kuitpo Tungkillo Oukaparinga Talunga Yatala Parawirra Moorooroo Whangarei Woolundunga Booleroo Pernatty Parramatta Taroom Narrandera Deniliquin Kawakawa .
Parsing [sent. 4240 len. 21]: It may be best to build the poem now , and make the weather help A SWELTERING DAY IN AUSTRALIA .
Parsing [sent. 4241 len. 15]: -LRB- To be read soft and low , with the lights turned down . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 4242 len. 152]: The Bombola faints in the hot Bowral tree , Where fierce Mullengudgery 's smothering fires Far from the breezes of Coolgardie Burn ghastly and blue as the day expires ; And Murriwillumba complaineth in song For the garlanded bowers of Woolloomooloo , And the Ballarat Fly and the lone Wollongong They dream of the gardens of Jamberoo ; The wallabi sighs for the Murrubidgee , For the velvety sod of the Munno Parah , Where the waters of healing from Muloowurtie Flow dim in the gloaming by Yaranyackah ; The Koppio sorrows for lost Wolloway , And sigheth in secret for Murrurundi , The Whangeroo wombat lamenteth the day That made him an exile from Jerrilderie ; The Teawamute Tumut from Wirrega 's glade , The Nangkita swallow , the Wallaroo swan , They long for the peace of the Timaru shade And thy balmy soft airs , O sweet Mittagong !
Parsing [sent. 4243 len. 100]: The Kooringa buffalo pants in the sun , The Kondoparinga lies gaping for breath , The Kongorong Camaum to the shadow has won , But the Goomeroo sinks in the slumber of death ; In the weltering hell of the Moorooroo plain The Yatala Wangary withers and dies , And the Worrow Wanilla , demented with pain , To the Woolgoolga woodlands despairingly flies ; Sweet Nangwarry 's desolate , Coonamble wails , And Tungkillo Kuito in sables is drest , For the Whangerei winds fall asleep in the sails And the Booleroo life-breeze is dead in the west .
Parsing [sent. 4244 len. 21]: Mypongo , Kapunda , O slumber no more Yankalilla , Parawirra , be warned There 's death in the air !
Parsing [sent. 4245 len. 11]: Killanoola , wherefore Shall the prayer of Penola be scorned ?
Parsing [sent. 4246 len. 26]: Cootamundra , and Takee , and Wakatipu , Toowoomba , Kaikoura are lost From Onkaparinga to far Oamaru All burn in this hell 's holocaust !
Parsing [sent. 4247 len. 33]: Paramatta and Binnum are gone to their rest In the vale of Tapanni Taroom , Kawakawa , Deniliquin -- all that was best In the earth are but graves and a tomb !
Parsing [sent. 4248 len. 30]: Narrandera mourns , Cameron answers not When the roll of the scathless we cry Tongariro , Goondiwindi , Woolundunga , the spot Is mute and forlorn where ye lie .
Parsing [sent. 4249 len. 7]: Those are good words for poetry .
Parsing [sent. 4250 len. 8]: Among the best I have ever seen .
Parsing [sent. 4251 len. 7]: There are 81 in the list .
Parsing [sent. 4252 len. 35]: I did not need them all , but I have knocked down 66 of them ; which is a good bag , it seems to me , for a person not in the business .
Parsing [sent. 4253 len. 20]: Perhaps a poet laureate could do better , but a poet laureate gets wages , and that is different .
Parsing [sent. 4254 len. 18]: When I write poetry I do not get any wages ; often I lose money by it .
Parsing [sent. 4255 len. 17]: The best word in that list , and the most musical and gurgly , is Woolloomoolloo .
Parsing [sent. 4256 len. 13]: It is a place near Sydney , and is a favorite pleasure-resort .
Parsing [sent. 4257 len. 8]: It has eight O 's in it .
Parsing [sent. 4258 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXXVII .
Parsing [sent. 4259 len. 22]: To succeed in the other trades , capacity must be shown ; in the law , concealment of it will do .
Parsing [sent. 4260 len. 9]: -- Pudd ` nhead Wilson 's New Calendar .
Parsing [sent. 4261 len. 8]: MONDAY , -- December 23 , 1895 .
Parsing [sent. 4262 len. 15]: Sailed from Sydney for Ceylon in the P. & O. steamer ` Oceana ' .
Parsing [sent. 4263 len. 13]: A Lascar crew mans this ship -- the first I have seen .
Parsing [sent. 4264 len. 49]: White cotton petticoat and pants ; barefoot ; red shawl for belt ; straw cap , brimless , on head , with red scarf wound around it ; complexion a rich dark brown ; short straight black hair ; whiskers fine and silky ; lustrous and intensely black .
Parsing [sent. 4265 len. 27]: Mild , good faces ; willing and obedient people ; capable , too ; but are said to go into hopeless panics when there is danger .
Parsing [sent. 4266 len. 9]: They are from Bombay and the coast thereabouts .
Parsing [sent. 4267 len. 24]: Left some of the trunks in Sydney , to be shipped to South Africa by a vessel advertised to sail three months hence .
Parsing [sent. 4268 len. 13]: The proverb says : `` Separate not yourself from your baggage . ''
Parsing [sent. 4269 len. 13]: This ` Oceana ' is a stately big ship , luxuriously appointed .
Parsing [sent. 4270 len. 6]: She has spacious promenade decks .
Parsing [sent. 4271 len. 8]: Large rooms ; a surpassingly comfortable ship .
Parsing [sent. 4272 len. 20]: The officers ' library is well selected ; a ship 's library is not usually that . . . .
Parsing [sent. 4273 len. 21]: For meals , the bugle call , man-of-war fashion ; a pleasant change from the terrible gong . . . .
Parsing [sent. 4274 len. 27]: Three big cats -- very friendly loafers ; they wander all over the ship ; the white one follows the chief steward around like a dog .
Parsing [sent. 4275 len. 8]: There is also a basket of kittens .
Parsing [sent. 4276 len. 41]: One of these cats goes ashore , in port , in England , Australia , and India , to see how his various families are getting along , and is seen no more till the ship is ready to sail .
Parsing [sent. 4277 len. 46]: No one knows how he finds out the sailing date , but no doubt he comes down to the dock every day and takes a look , and when he sees baggage and passengers flocking in , recognizes that it is time to get aboard .
Parsing [sent. 4278 len. 7]: This is what the sailors believe .
Parsing [sent. 4279 len. 30]: The Chief Engineer has been in the China and India trade thirty three years , and has had but three Christmases at home in that time . . . .
Parsing [sent. 4280 len. 8]: Conversational items at dinner , `` Mocha !
Parsing [sent. 4281 len. 6]: sold all over the world !
Parsing [sent. 4282 len. 5]: It is not true .
Parsing [sent. 4283 len. 28]: In fact , very few foreigners except the Emperor of Russia have ever seen a grain of it , or ever will , while they live . ''
Parsing [sent. 4284 len. 15]: Another man said : `` There is no sale in Australia for Australian wine .
Parsing [sent. 4285 len. 22]: But it goes to France and comes back with a French label on it , and then they buy it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4286 len. 18]: I have heard that the most of the French-labeled claret in New York is made in California .
Parsing [sent. 4287 len. 25]: And I remember what Professor S. told me once about Veuve Cliquot -- if that was the wine , and I think it was .
Parsing [sent. 4288 len. 32]: He was the guest of a great wine merchant whose town was quite near that vineyard , and this merchant asked him if very much V. C. was drunk in America .
Parsing [sent. 4289 len. 17]: `` Oh , yes , '' said S. , `` a great abundance of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4290 len. 9]: `` Is it easy to be had ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4291 len. 9]: `` Oh , yes -- easy as water .
Parsing [sent. 4292 len. 9]: All first and second-class hotels have it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4293 len. 9]: `` What do you pay for it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4294 len. 19]: `` It depends on the style of the hotel -- from fifteen to twenty-five francs a bottle . ''
Parsing [sent. 4295 len. 6]: `` Oh , fortunate country !
Parsing [sent. 4296 len. 14]: Why , it 's worth 100 francs right here on the ground . ''
Parsing [sent. 4297 len. 4]: `` No ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4298 len. 4]: `` Yes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4299 len. 15]: `` Do you mean that we are drinking a bogus Veuve-Cliquot over there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4300 len. 19]: `` Yes -- and there was never a bottle of the genuine in America since Columbus 's time .
Parsing [sent. 4301 len. 42]: That wine all comes from a little bit of a patch of ground which is n't big enough to raise many bottles ; and all of it that is produced goes every year to one person -- the Emperor of Russia .
Parsing [sent. 4302 len. 15]: He takes the whole crop in advance , be it big or little . ''
Parsing [sent. 4303 len. 5]: January 4 , 1896 .
Parsing [sent. 4304 len. 25]: Christmas in Melbourne , New Year 's Day in Adelaide , and saw most of the friends again in both places . . . .
Parsing [sent. 4305 len. 18]: Lying here at anchor all day -- Albany -LRB- King George 's Sound -RRB- , Western Australia .
Parsing [sent. 4306 len. 20]: It is a perfectly landlocked harbor , or roadstead -- spacious to look at , but not deep water .
Parsing [sent. 4307 len. 6]: Desolate-looking rocks and scarred hills .
Parsing [sent. 4308 len. 12]: Plenty of ships arriving now , rushing to the new gold-fields .
Parsing [sent. 4309 len. 21]: The papers are full of wonderful tales of the sort always to be heard in connection with new gold diggings .
Parsing [sent. 4310 len. 43]: A sample : a youth staked out a claim and tried to sell half for L5 ; no takers ; he stuck to it fourteen days , starving , then struck it rich and sold out for L10 ,000 . . . .
Parsing [sent. 4311 len. 12]: About sunset , strong breeze blowing , got up the anchor .
Parsing [sent. 4312 len. 24]: We were in a small deep puddle , with a narrow channel leading out of it , minutely buoyed , to the sea .
Parsing [sent. 4313 len. 24]: I stayed on deck to see how we were going to manage it with such a big ship and such a strong wind .
Parsing [sent. 4314 len. 43]: On the bridge our giant captain , in uniform ; at his side a little pilot in elaborately gold-laced uniform ; on the forecastle a white mate and quartermaster or two , and a brilliant crowd of lascars standing by for business .
Parsing [sent. 4315 len. 29]: Our stern was pointing straight at the head of the channel ; so we must turn entirely around in the puddle -- and the wind blowing as described .
Parsing [sent. 4316 len. 7]: It was done , and beautifully .
Parsing [sent. 4317 len. 9]: It was done by help of a jib .
Parsing [sent. 4318 len. 13]: We stirred up much mud , but did not touch the bottom .
Parsing [sent. 4319 len. 12]: We turned right around in our tracks -- a seeming impossibility .
Parsing [sent. 4320 len. 24]: We had several casts of quarter-less 5 , and one cast of half 4 -- 27 feet ; we were drawing 26 astern .
Parsing [sent. 4321 len. 25]: By the time we were entirely around and pointed , the first buoy was not more than a hundred yards in front of us .
Parsing [sent. 4322 len. 18]: It was a fine piece of work , and I was the only passenger that saw it .
Parsing [sent. 4323 len. 19]: However , the others got their dinner ; the P. & O. Company got mine . . . .
Parsing [sent. 4324 len. 4]: More cats developed .
Parsing [sent. 4325 len. 32]: Smythe says it is a British law that they must be carried ; and he instanced a case of a ship not allowed to sail till she sent for a couple .
Parsing [sent. 4326 len. 20]: The bill came , too : `` Debtor , to 2 cats , 20 shillings . '' . . .
Parsing [sent. 4327 len. 20]: News comes that within this week Siam has acknowledged herself to be , in effect , a French province .
Parsing [sent. 4328 len. 18]: It seems plain that all savage and semi-civilized countries are going to be grabbed . . . .
Parsing [sent. 4329 len. 66]: A vulture on board ; bald , red , queer-shaped head , featherless red places here and there on his body , intense great black eyes set in featherless rims of inflamed flesh ; dissipated look ; a businesslike style , a selfish , conscienceless , murderous aspect -- the very look of a professional assassin , and yet a bird which does no murder .
Parsing [sent. 4330 len. 20]: What was the use of getting him up in that tragic style for so innocent a trade as his ?
Parsing [sent. 4331 len. 32]: For this one is n't the sort that wars upon the living , his diet is offal -- and the more out of date it is the better he likes it .
Parsing [sent. 4332 len. 44]: Nature should give him a suit of rusty black ; then he would be all right , for he would look like an undertaker and would harmonize with his business ; whereas the way he is now he is horribly out of true .
Parsing [sent. 4333 len. 3]: January 5 .
Parsing [sent. 4334 len. 25]: At 9 this morning we passed Cape Leeuwin -LRB- lioness -RRB- and ceased from our long due-west course along the southern shore of Australia .
Parsing [sent. 4335 len. 24]: Turning this extreme southwestern corner , we now take a long straight slant nearly N. W. , without a break , for Ceylon .
Parsing [sent. 4336 len. 35]: As we speed northward it will grow hotter very fast -- but it is n't chilly , now ... The vulture is from the public menagerie at Adelaide -- a great and interesting collection .
Parsing [sent. 4337 len. 22]: It was there that we saw the baby tiger solemnly spreading its mouth and trying to roar like its majestic mother .
Parsing [sent. 4338 len. 81]: It swaggered , scowling , back and forth on its short legs just as it had seen her do on her long ones , and now and then snarling viciously , exposing its teeth , with a threatening lift of its upper lip and bristling moustache ; and when it thought it was impressing the visitors , it would spread its mouth wide and do that screechy cry which it meant for a roar , but which did not deceive .
Parsing [sent. 4339 len. 11]: It took itself quite seriously , and was lovably comical .
Parsing [sent. 4340 len. 18]: And there was a hyena -- an ugly creature ; as ugly as the tiger-kitty was pretty .
Parsing [sent. 4341 len. 31]: It repeatedly arched its back and delivered itself of such a human cry ; a startling resemblance ; a cry which was just that of a grown person badly hurt .
Parsing [sent. 4342 len. 18]: In the dark one would assuredly go to its assistance -- and be disappointed . . . .
Parsing [sent. 4343 len. 8]: Many friends of Australasian Federation on board .
Parsing [sent. 4344 len. 14]: They feel sure that the good day is not far off , now .
Parsing [sent. 4345 len. 29]: But there seems to be a party that would go further -- have Australasia cut loose from the British Empire and set up housekeeping on her own hook .
Parsing [sent. 4346 len. 6]: It seems an unwise idea .
Parsing [sent. 4347 len. 23]: They point to the United States , but it seems to me that the cases lack a good deal of being alike .
Parsing [sent. 4348 len. 22]: Australasia governs herself wholly -- there is no interference ; and her commerce and manufactures are not oppressed in any way .
Parsing [sent. 4349 len. 17]: If our case had been the same we should not have gone out when we did .
Parsing [sent. 4350 len. 3]: January 13 .
Parsing [sent. 4351 len. 3]: Unspeakably hot .
Parsing [sent. 4352 len. 6]: The equator is arriving again .
Parsing [sent. 4353 len. 8]: We are within eight degrees of it .
Parsing [sent. 4354 len. 3]: Ceylon present .
Parsing [sent. 4355 len. 7]: Dear me , it is beautiful !
Parsing [sent. 4356 len. 15]: And most sumptuously tropical , as to character of foliage and opulence of it .
Parsing [sent. 4357 len. 70]: `` What though the spicy breezes blow soft o'er Ceylon 's isle '' -- an eloquent line , an incomparable line ; it says little , but conveys whole libraries of sentiment , and Oriental charm and mystery , and tropic deliciousness -- a line that quivers and tingles with a thousand unexpressed and inexpressible things , things that haunt one and find no articulate voice . . . .
Parsing [sent. 4358 len. 5]: Colombo , the capital .
Parsing [sent. 4359 len. 10]: An Oriental town , most manifestly ; and fascinating .
Parsing [sent. 4360 len. 10]: In this palatial ship the passengers dress for dinner .
Parsing [sent. 4361 len. 33]: The ladies ' toilettes make a fine display of color , and this is in keeping with the elegance of the vessel 's furnishings and the flooding brilliancies of the electric light .
Parsing [sent. 4362 len. 64]: On the stormy Atlantic one never sees a man in evening dress , except at the rarest intervals ; and then there is only one , not two ; and he shows up but once on the voyage -- the night before the ship makes port -- the night when they have the `` concert '' and do the amateur wailings and recitations .
Parsing [sent. 4363 len. 12]: He is the tenor , as a rule . . . .
Parsing [sent. 4364 len. 52]: There has been a deal of cricket-playing on board ; it seems a queer game for a ship , but they enclose the promenade deck with nettings and keep the ball from flying overboard , and the sport goes very well , and is properly violent and exciting . . . .
Parsing [sent. 4365 len. 8]: We must part from this vessel here .
Parsing [sent. 4366 len. 3]: January 14 .
Parsing [sent. 4367 len. 3]: Hotel Bristol .
Parsing [sent. 4368 len. 3]: Servant Brompy .
Parsing [sent. 4369 len. 14]: Alert , gentle , smiling , winning young brown creature as ever was .
Parsing [sent. 4370 len. 63]: Beautiful shining black hair combed back like a woman 's , and knotted at the back of his head -- tortoise-shell comb in it , sign that he is a Singhalese ; slender , shapely form ; jacket ; under it is a beltless and flowing white cotton gown -- from neck straight to heel ; he and his outfit quite unmasculine .
Parsing [sent. 4371 len. 9]: It was an embarrassment to undress before him .
Parsing [sent. 4372 len. 17]: We drove to the market , using the Japanese jinriksha -- our first acquaintanceship with it .
Parsing [sent. 4373 len. 13]: It is a light cart , with a native to draw it .
Parsing [sent. 4374 len. 22]: He makes good speed for half-an-hour , but it is hard work for him ; he is too slight for it .
Parsing [sent. 4375 len. 37]: After the half-hour there is no more pleasure for you ; your attention is all on the man , just as it would be on a tired horse , and necessarily your sympathy is there too .
Parsing [sent. 4376 len. 16]: There 's a plenty of these ` rickshas , and the tariff is incredibly cheap .
Parsing [sent. 4377 len. 7]: I was in Cairo years ago .
Parsing [sent. 4378 len. 10]: That was Oriental , but there was a lack .
Parsing [sent. 4379 len. 37]: When you are in Florida or New Orleans you are in the South -- that is granted ; but you are not in the South ; you are in a modified South , a tempered South .
Parsing [sent. 4380 len. 14]: Cairo was a tempered Orient -- an Orient with an indefinite something wanting .
Parsing [sent. 4381 len. 8]: That feeling was not present in Ceylon .
Parsing [sent. 4382 len. 31]: Ceylon was Oriental in the last measure of completeness -- utterly Oriental ; also utterly tropical ; and indeed to one 's unreasoning spiritual sense the two things belong together .
Parsing [sent. 4383 len. 6]: All the requisites were present .
Parsing [sent. 4384 len. 115]: The costumes were right ; the black and brown exposures , unconscious of immodesty , were right ; the juggler was there , with his basket , his snakes , his mongoose , and his arrangements for growing a tree from seed to foliage and ripe fruitage before one 's eyes ; in sight were plants and flowers familiar to one on books but in no other way -- celebrated , desirable , strange , but in production restricted to the hot belt of the equator ; and out a little way in the country were the proper deadly snakes , and fierce beasts of prey , and the wild elephant and the monkey .
Parsing [sent. 4385 len. 72]: And there was that swoon in the air which one associates with the tropics , and that smother of heat , heavy with odors of unknown flowers , and that sudden invasion of purple gloom fissured with lightnings , -- then the tumult of crashing thunder and the downpour and presently all sunny and smiling again ; all these things were there ; the conditions were complete , nothing was lacking .
Parsing [sent. 4386 len. 66]: And away off in the deeps of the jungle and in the remotenesses of the mountains were the ruined cities and mouldering temples , mysterious relics of the pomps of a forgotten time and a vanished race -- and this was as it should be , also , for nothing is quite satisfyingly Oriental that lacks the somber and impressive qualities of mystery and antiquity .
Parsing [sent. 4387 len. 34]: The drive through the town and out to the Galle Face by the seashore , what a dream it was of tropical splendors of bloom and blossom , and Oriental conflagrations of costume !
Parsing [sent. 4388 len. 28]: The walking groups of men , women , boys , girls , babies -- each individual was a flame , each group a house afire for color .
Parsing [sent. 4389 len. 22]: And such stunning colors , such intensely vivid colors , such rich and exquisite minglings and fusings of rainbows and lightnings !
Parsing [sent. 4390 len. 42]: And all harmonious , all in perfect taste ; never a discordant note ; never a color on any person swearing at another color on him or failing to harmonize faultlessly with the colors of any group the wearer might join .
Parsing [sent. 4391 len. 97]: The stuffs were silk -- thin , soft , delicate , clinging ; and , as a rule , each piece a solid color : a splendid green , a splendid blue , a splendid yellow , a splendid purple , a splendid ruby , deep , and rich with smouldering fires -- they swept continuously by in crowds and legions and multitudes , glowing , flashing , burning , radiant ; and every five seconds came a burst of blinding red that made a body catch his breath , and filled his heart with joy .
Parsing [sent. 4392 len. 10]: And then , the unimaginable grace of those costumes !
Parsing [sent. 4393 len. 62]: Sometimes a woman 's whole dress was but a scarf wound about her person and her head , sometimes a man 's was but a turban and a careless rag or two -- in both cases generous areas of polished dark skin showing -- but always the arrangement compelled the homage of the eye and made the heart sing for gladness .
Parsing [sent. 4394 len. 73]: I can see it to this day , that radiant panorama , that wilderness of rich color , that incomparable dissolving-view of harmonious tints , and lithe half-covered forms , and beautiful brown faces , and gracious and graceful gestures and attitudes and movements , free , unstudied , barren of stiffness and restraint , and -- Just then , into this dream of fairyland and paradise a grating dissonance was injected .
Parsing [sent. 4395 len. 48]: Out of a missionary school came marching , two and two , sixteen prim and pious little Christian black girls , Europeanly clothed -- dressed , to the last detail , as they would have been dressed on a summer Sunday in an English or American village .
Parsing [sent. 4396 len. 10]: Those clothes -- oh , they were unspeakably ugly !
Parsing [sent. 4397 len. 17]: Ugly , barbarous , destitute of taste , destitute of grace , repulsive as a shroud .
Parsing [sent. 4398 len. 33]: I looked at my womenfolk 's clothes -- just full-grown duplicates of the outrages disguising those poor little abused creatures -- and was ashamed to be seen in the street with them .
Parsing [sent. 4399 len. 20]: Then I looked at my own clothes , and was ashamed to be seen in the street with myself .
Parsing [sent. 4400 len. 20]: However , we must put up with our clothes as they are -- they have their reason for existing .
Parsing [sent. 4401 len. 17]: They are on us to expose us -- to advertise what we wear them to conceal .
Parsing [sent. 4402 len. 45]: They are a sign ; a sign of insincerity ; a sign of suppressed vanity ; a pretense that we despise gorgeous colors and the graces of harmony and form ; and we put them on to propagate that lie and back it up .
Parsing [sent. 4403 len. 24]: But we do not deceive our neighbor ; and when we step into Ceylon we realize that we have not even deceived ourselves .
Parsing [sent. 4404 len. 33]: We do love brilliant colors and graceful costumes ; and at home we will turn out in a storm to see them when the procession goes by -- and envy the wearers .
Parsing [sent. 4405 len. 20]: We go to the theater to look at them and grieve that we ca n't be clothed like that .
Parsing [sent. 4406 len. 29]: We go to the King 's ball , when we get a chance , and are glad of a sight of the splendid uniforms and the glittering orders .
Parsing [sent. 4407 len. 75]: When we are granted permission to attend an imperial drawing-room we shut ourselves up in private and parade around in the theatrical court-dress by the hour , and admire ourselves in the glass , and are utterly happy ; and every member of every governor 's staff in democratic America does the same with his grand new uniform -- and if he is not watched he will get himself photographed in it , too .
Parsing [sent. 4408 len. 15]: When I see the Lord Mayor 's footman I am dissatisfied with my lot .
Parsing [sent. 4409 len. 19]: Yes , our clothes are a lie , and have been nothing short of that these hundred years .
Parsing [sent. 4410 len. 21]: They are insincere , they are the ugly and appropriate outward exposure of an inward sham and a moral decay .
Parsing [sent. 4411 len. 56]: The last little brown boy I chanced to notice in the crowds and swarms of Colombo had nothing on but a twine string around his waist , but in my memory the frank honesty of his costume still stands out in pleasant contrast with the odious flummery in which the little Sunday-school dowdies were masquerading .
Parsing [sent. 4412 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXXVIII .
Parsing [sent. 4413 len. 8]: Prosperity is the best protector of principle .
Parsing [sent. 4414 len. 9]: -- Pudd ` nhead Wilson 's New Calendar .
Parsing [sent. 4415 len. 4]: EVENING -- 14th .
Parsing [sent. 4416 len. 5]: Sailed in the Rosetta .
Parsing [sent. 4417 len. 15]: This is a poor old ship , and ought to be insured and sunk .
Parsing [sent. 4418 len. 25]: As in the ` Oceana ' , just so here : everybody dresses for dinner ; they make it a sort of pious duty .
Parsing [sent. 4419 len. 22]: These fine and formal costumes are a rather conspicuous contrast to the poverty and shabbiness of the surroundings . . . .
Parsing [sent. 4420 len. 22]: If you want a slice of a lime at four o'clock tea , you must sign an order on the bar .
Parsing [sent. 4421 len. 7]: Limes cost 14 cents a barrel .
Parsing [sent. 4422 len. 3]: January 18th .
Parsing [sent. 4423 len. 11]: We have been running up the Arabian Sea , latterly .
Parsing [sent. 4424 len. 13]: Closing up on Bombay now , and due to arrive this evening .
Parsing [sent. 4425 len. 3]: January 20th .
Parsing [sent. 4426 len. 2]: Bombay !
Parsing [sent. 4427 len. 18]: A bewitching place , a bewildering place , an enchanting place -- the Arabian Nights come again ?
Parsing [sent. 4428 len. 12]: It is a vast city ; contains about a million inhabitants .
Parsing [sent. 4429 len. 30]: Natives , they are , with a slight sprinkling of white people -- not enough to have the slightest modifying effect upon the massed dark complexion of the public .
Parsing [sent. 4430 len. 27]: It is winter here , yet the weather is the divine weather of June , and the foliage is the fresh and heavenly foliage of June .
Parsing [sent. 4431 len. 58]: There is a rank of noble great shade trees across the way from the hotel , and under them sit groups of picturesque natives of both sexes ; and the juggler in his turban is there with his snakes and his magic ; and all day long the cabs and the multitudinous varieties of costumes flock by .
Parsing [sent. 4432 len. 26]: It does not seem as if one could ever get tired of watching this moving show , this shining and shifting spectacle . . . .
Parsing [sent. 4433 len. 39]: In the great bazar the pack and jam of natives was marvelous , the sea of rich-colored turbans and draperies an inspiring sight , and the quaint and showy Indian architecture was just the right setting for it .
Parsing [sent. 4434 len. 29]: Toward sunset another show ; this is the drive around the sea-shore to Malabar Point , where Lord Sandhurst , the Governor of the Bombay Presidency , lives .
Parsing [sent. 4435 len. 57]: Parsee palaces all along the first part of the drive ; and past them all the world is driving ; the private carriages of wealthy Englishmen and natives of rank are manned by a driver and three footmen in stunning oriental liveries -- two of these turbaned statues standing up behind , as fine as monuments .
Parsing [sent. 4436 len. 52]: Sometimes even the public carriages have this superabundant crew , slightly modified -- one to drive , one to sit by and see it done , and one to stand up behind and yell -- yell when there is anybody in the way , and for practice when there is n't .
Parsing [sent. 4437 len. 22]: It all helps to keep up the liveliness and augment the general sense of swiftness and energy and confusion and pow-wow .
Parsing [sent. 4438 len. 63]: In the region of Scandal Point -- felicitous name -- where there are handy rocks to sit on and a noble view of the sea on the one hand , and on the other the passing and repassing whirl and tumult of gay carriages , are great groups of comfortably-off Parsee women -- perfect flower-beds of brilliant color , a fascinating spectacle .
Parsing [sent. 4439 len. 33]: Tramp , tramp , tramping along the road , in singles , couples , groups , and gangs , you have the working-man and the working-woman -- but not clothed like ours .
Parsing [sent. 4440 len. 42]: Usually the man is a nobly-built great athlete , with not a rag on but his loin-handkerchief ; his color a deep dark brown , his skin satin , his rounded muscles knobbing it as if it had eggs under it .
Parsing [sent. 4441 len. 53]: Usually the woman is a slender and shapely creature , as erect as a lightning-rod , and she has but one thing on -- a bright-colored piece of stuff which is wound about her head and her body down nearly half-way to her knees , and which clings like her own skin .
Parsing [sent. 4442 len. 30]: Her legs and feet are bare , and so are her arms , except for her fanciful bunches of loose silver rings on her ankles and on her arms .
Parsing [sent. 4443 len. 19]: She has jewelry bunched on the side of her nose also , and showy clusterings on her toes .
Parsing [sent. 4444 len. 14]: When she undresses for bed she takes off her jewelry , I suppose .
Parsing [sent. 4445 len. 11]: If she took off anything more she would catch cold .
Parsing [sent. 4446 len. 33]: As a rule she has a large shiney brass water jar of graceful shape on her head , and one of her naked arms curves up and the hand holds it there .
Parsing [sent. 4447 len. 51]: She is so straight , so erect , and she steps with such style , and such easy grace and dignity ; and her curved arm and her brazen jar are such a help to the picture -- indeed , our working-women can not begin with her as a road-decoration .
Parsing [sent. 4448 len. 68]: It is all color , bewitching color , enchanting color -- everywhere all around -- all the way around the curving great opaline bay clear to Government House , where the turbaned big native ` chuprassies ' stand grouped in state at the door in their robes of fiery red , and do most properly and stunningly finish up the splendid show and make it theatrically complete .
Parsing [sent. 4449 len. 9]: I wish I were a ` chuprassy ' .
Parsing [sent. 4450 len. 5]: This is indeed India !
Parsing [sent. 4451 len. 181]: the land of dreams and romance , of fabulous wealth and fabulous poverty , of splendor and rags , of palaces and hovels , of famine and pestilence , of genii and giants and Aladdin lamps , of tigers and elephants , the cobra and the jungle , the country of a hundred nations and a hundred tongues , of a thousand religions and two million gods , cradle of the human race , birthplace of human speech , mother of history , grandmother of legend , great-grandmother of tradition , whose yesterdays bear date with the mouldering antiquities of the rest of the nations -- the one sole country under the sun that is endowed with an imperishable interest for alien prince and alien peasant , for lettered and ignorant , wise and fool , rich and poor , bond and free , the one land that all men desire to see , and having seen once , by even a glimpse , would not give that glimpse for the shows of all the rest of the globe combined .
Parsing [sent. 4452 len. 28]: Even now , after the lapse of a year , the delirium of those days in Bombay has not left me , and I hope never will .
Parsing [sent. 4453 len. 11]: It was all new , no detail of it hackneyed .
Parsing [sent. 4454 len. 17]: And India did not wait for morning , it began at the hotel -- straight away .
Parsing [sent. 4455 len. 80]: The lobbies and halls were full of turbaned , and fez 'd and embroidered , cap 'd , and barefooted , and cotton-clad dark natives , some of them rushing about , others at rest squatting , or sitting on the ground ; some of them chattering with energy , others still and dreamy ; in the dining-room every man 's own private native servant standing behind his chair , and dressed for a part in the Arabian Nights .
Parsing [sent. 4456 len. 10]: Our rooms were high up , on the front .
Parsing [sent. 4457 len. 26]: A white man -- he was a burly German -- went up with us , and brought three natives along to see to arranging things .
Parsing [sent. 4458 len. 32]: About fourteen others followed in procession , with the hand-baggage ; each carried an article -- and only one ; a bag , in some cases , in other cases less .
Parsing [sent. 4459 len. 35]: One strong native carried my overcoat , another a parasol , another a box of cigars , another a novel , and the last man in the procession had no load but a fan .
Parsing [sent. 4460 len. 28]: It was all done with earnestness and sincerity , there was not a smile in the procession from the head of it to the tail of it .
Parsing [sent. 4461 len. 44]: Each man waited patiently , tranquilly , in no sort of hurry , till one of us found time to give him a copper , then he bent his head reverently , touched his forehead with his fingers , and went his way .
Parsing [sent. 4462 len. 20]: They seemed a soft and gentle race , and there was something both winning and touching about their demeanor .
Parsing [sent. 4463 len. 12]: There was a vast glazed door which opened upon the balcony .
Parsing [sent. 4464 len. 25]: It needed closing , or cleaning , or something , and a native got down on his knees and went to work at it .
Parsing [sent. 4465 len. 52]: He seemed to be doing it well enough , but perhaps he was n't , for the burly German put on a look that betrayed dissatisfaction , then without explaining what was wrong , gave the native a brisk cuff on the jaw and then told him where the defect was .
Parsing [sent. 4466 len. 12]: It seemed such a shame to do that before us all .
Parsing [sent. 4467 len. 21]: The native took it with meekness , saying nothing , and not showing in his face or manner any resentment .
Parsing [sent. 4468 len. 12]: I had not seen the like of this for fifty years .
Parsing [sent. 4469 len. 30]: It carried me back to my boyhood , and flashed upon me the forgotten fact that this was the usual way of explaining one 's desires to a slave .
Parsing [sent. 4470 len. 55]: I was able to remember that the method seemed right and natural to me in those days , I being born to it and unaware that elsewhere there were other methods ; but I was also able to remember that those unresented cuffings made me sorry for the victim and ashamed for the punisher .
Parsing [sent. 4471 len. 62]: My father was a refined and kindly gentleman , very grave , rather austere , of rigid probity , a sternly just and upright man , albeit he attended no church and never spoke of religious matters , and had no part nor lot in the pious joys of his Presbyterian family , nor ever seemed to suffer from this deprivation .
Parsing [sent. 4472 len. 46]: He laid his hand upon me in punishment only twice in his life , and then not heavily ; once for telling him a lie -- which surprised me , and showed me how unsuspicious he was , for that was not my maiden effort .
Parsing [sent. 4473 len. 40]: He punished me those two times only , and never any other member of the family at all ; yet every now and then he cuffed our harmless slave boy , Lewis , for trifling little blunders and awkwardnesses .
Parsing [sent. 4474 len. 30]: My father had passed his life among the slaves from his cradle up , and his cuffings proceeded from the custom of the time , not from his nature .
Parsing [sent. 4475 len. 34]: When I was ten years old I saw a man fling a lump of iron-ore at a slaveman in anger , for merely doing something awkwardly -- as if that were a crime .
Parsing [sent. 4476 len. 17]: It bounded from the man 's skull , and the man fell and never spoke again .
Parsing [sent. 4477 len. 7]: He was dead in an hour .
Parsing [sent. 4478 len. 46]: I knew the man had a right to kill his slave if he wanted to , and yet it seemed a pitiful thing and somehow wrong , though why wrong I was not deep enough to explain if I had been asked to do it .
Parsing [sent. 4479 len. 19]: Nobody in the village approved of that murder , but of course no one said much about it .
Parsing [sent. 4480 len. 10]: It is curious -- the space-annihilating power of thought .
Parsing [sent. 4481 len. 73]: For just one second , all that goes to make the me in me was in a Missourian village , on the other side of the globe , vividly seeing again these forgotten pictures of fifty years ago , and wholly unconscious of all things but just those ; and in the next second I was back in Bombay , and that kneeling native 's smitten cheek was not done tingling yet !
Parsing [sent. 4482 len. 32]: Back to boyhood -- fifty years ; back to age again , another fifty ; and a flight equal to the circumference of the globe-all in two seconds by the watch !
Parsing [sent. 4483 len. 37]: Some natives -- I do n't remember how many -- went into my bedroom , now , and put things to rights and arranged the mosquito-bar , and I went to bed to nurse my cough .
Parsing [sent. 4484 len. 8]: It was about nine in the evening .
Parsing [sent. 4485 len. 6]: What a state of things !
Parsing [sent. 4486 len. 31]: For three hours the yelling and shouting of natives in the hall continued , along with the velvety patter of their swift bare feet -- what a racket it was !
Parsing [sent. 4487 len. 10]: They were yelling orders and messages down three flights .
Parsing [sent. 4488 len. 19]: Why , in the matter of noise it amounted to a riot , an insurrection , a revolution .
Parsing [sent. 4489 len. 63]: And then there were other noises mixed up with these and at intervals tremendously accenting them -- roofs falling in , I judged , windows smashing , persons being murdered , crows squawking , and deriding , and cursing , canaries screeching , monkeys jabbering , macaws blaspheming , and every now and then fiendish bursts of laughter and explosions of dynamite .
Parsing [sent. 4490 len. 32]: By midnight I had suffered all the different kinds of shocks there are , and knew that I could never more be disturbed by them , either isolated or in combination .
Parsing [sent. 4491 len. 13]: Then came peace -- stillness deep and solemn and lasted till five .
Parsing [sent. 4492 len. 7]: Then it all broke loose again .
Parsing [sent. 4493 len. 5]: And who re-started it ?
Parsing [sent. 4494 len. 8]: The Bird of Birds the Indian crow .
Parsing [sent. 4495 len. 17]: I came to know him well , by and by , and be infatuated with him .
Parsing [sent. 4496 len. 11]: I suppose he is the hardest lot that wears feathers .
Parsing [sent. 4497 len. 13]: Yes , and the cheerfulest , and the best satisfied with himself .
Parsing [sent. 4498 len. 56]: He never arrived at what he is by any careless process , or any sudden one ; he is a work of art , and `` art is long '' ; he is the product of immemorial ages , and of deep calculation ; one ca n't make a bird like that in a day .
Parsing [sent. 4499 len. 26]: He has been reincarnated more times than Shiva ; and he has kept a sample of each incarnation , and fused it into his constitution .
Parsing [sent. 4500 len. 119]: In the course of his evolutionary promotions , his sublime march toward ultimate perfection , he has been a gambler , a low comedian , a dissolute priest , a fussy woman , a blackguard , a scoffer , a liar , a thief , a spy , an informer , a trading politician , a swindler , a professional hypocrite , a patriot for cash , a reformer , a lecturer , a lawyer , a conspirator , a rebel , a royalist , a democrat , a practicer and propagator of irreverence , a meddler , an intruder , a busybody , an infidel , and a wallower in sin for the mere love of it .
Parsing [sent. 4501 len. 90]: The strange result , the incredible result , of this patient accumulation of all damnable traits is , that he does not know what care is , he does not know what sorrow is , he does not know what remorse is , his life is one long thundering ecstasy of happiness , and he will go to his death untroubled , knowing that he will soon turn up again as an author or something , and be even more intolerably capable and comfortable than ever he was before .
Parsing [sent. 4502 len. 41]: In his straddling wide forward-step , and his springy side-wise series of hops , and his impudent air , and his cunning way of canting his head to one side upon occasion , he reminds one of the American blackbird .
Parsing [sent. 4503 len. 7]: But the sharp resemblances stop there .
Parsing [sent. 4504 len. 59]: He is much bigger than the blackbird ; and he lacks the blackbird 's trim and slender and beautiful build and shapely beak ; and of course his sober garb of gray and rusty black is a poor and humble thing compared with the splendid lustre of the blackbird 's metallic sables and shifting and flashing bronze glories .
Parsing [sent. 4505 len. 71]: The blackbird is a perfect gentleman , in deportment and attire , and is not noisy , I believe , except when holding religious services and political conventions in a tree ; but this Indian sham Quaker is just a rowdy , and is always noisy when awake -- always chaffing , scolding , scoffing , laughing , ripping , and cursing , and carrying on about something or other .
Parsing [sent. 4506 len. 10]: I never saw such a bird for delivering opinions .
Parsing [sent. 4507 len. 31]: Nothing escapes him ; he notices everything that happens , and brings out his opinion about it , particularly if it is a matter that is none of his business .
Parsing [sent. 4508 len. 25]: And it is never a mild opinion , but always violent -- violent and profane -- the presence of ladies does not affect him .
Parsing [sent. 4509 len. 47]: His opinions are not the outcome of reflection , for he never thinks about anything , but heaves out the opinion that is on top in his mind , and which is often an opinion about some quite different thing and does not fit the case .
Parsing [sent. 4510 len. 27]: But that is his way ; his main idea is to get out an opinion , and if he stopped to think he would lose chances .
Parsing [sent. 4511 len. 9]: I suppose he has no enemies among men .
Parsing [sent. 4512 len. 39]: The whites and Mohammedans never seemed to molest him ; and the Hindoos , because of their religion , never take the life of any creature , but spare even the snakes and tigers and fleas and rats .
Parsing [sent. 4513 len. 198]: If I sat on one end of the balcony , the crows would gather on the railing at the other end and talk about me ; and edge closer , little by little , till I could almost reach them ; and they would sit there , in the most unabashed way , and talk about my clothes , and my hair , and my complexion , and probable character and vocation and politics , and how I came to be in India , and what I had been doing , and how many days I had got for it , and how I had happened to go unhanged so long , and when would it probably come off , and might there be more of my sort where I came from , and when would they be hanged , -- and so on , and so on , until I could not longer endure the embarrassment of it ; then I would shoo them away , and they would circle around in the air a little while , laughing and deriding and mocking , and presently settle on the rail and do it all over again .
Parsing [sent. 4514 len. 14]: They were very sociable when there was anything to eat -- oppressively so .
Parsing [sent. 4515 len. 62]: With a little encouragement they would come in and light on the table and help me eat my breakfast ; and once when I was in the other room and they found themselves alone , they carried off everything they could lift ; and they were particular to choose things which they could make no use of after they got them .
Parsing [sent. 4516 len. 15]: In India their number is beyond estimate , and their noise is in proportion .
Parsing [sent. 4517 len. 20]: I suppose they cost the country more than the government does ; yet that is not a light matter .
Parsing [sent. 4518 len. 23]: Still , they pay ; their company pays ; it would sadden the land to take their cheerful voice out of it .
Parsing [sent. 4519 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXXIX .
Parsing [sent. 4520 len. 10]: By trying we can easily learn to endure adversity .
Parsing [sent. 4521 len. 7]: Another man 's , I mean .
Parsing [sent. 4522 len. 9]: -- Pudd ` nhead Wilson 's New Calendar .
Parsing [sent. 4523 len. 62]: You soon find your long-ago dreams of India rising in a sort of vague and luscious moonlight above the horizon-rim of your opaque consciousness , and softly lighting up a thousand forgotten details which were parts of a vision that had once been vivid to you when you were a boy , and steeped your spirit in tales of the East .
Parsing [sent. 4524 len. 29]: The barbaric gorgeousnesses , for instance ; and the princely titles , the sumptuous titles , the sounding titles , -- how good they taste in the mouth !
Parsing [sent. 4525 len. 46]: The Nizam of Hyderabad ; the Maharajah of Travancore ; the Nabob of Jubbelpore ; the Begum of Bhopal ; the Nawab of Mysore ; the Ranee of Gulnare ; the Ahkoond of Swat 's ; the Rao of Rohilkund ; the Gaikwar of Baroda .
Parsing [sent. 4526 len. 12]: Indeed , it is a country that runs richly to name .
Parsing [sent. 4527 len. 23]: The great god Vishnu has 108 -- 108 special ones -- 108 peculiarly holy ones -- names just for Sunday use only .
Parsing [sent. 4528 len. 57]: I learned the whole of Vishnu 's 108 by heart once , but they would n't stay ; I do n't remember any of them now but John W. And the romances connected with those princely native houses -- to this day they are always turning up , just as in the old , old times .
Parsing [sent. 4529 len. 19]: They were sweating out a romance in an English court in Bombay a while before we were there .
Parsing [sent. 4530 len. 86]: In this case a native prince , 16 1/2 years old , who has been enjoying his titles and dignities and estates unmolested for fourteen years , is suddenly haled into court on the charge that he is rightfully no prince at all , but a pauper peasant ; that the real prince died when two and one-half years old ; that the death was concealed , and a peasant child smuggled into the royal cradle , and that this present incumbent was that smuggled substitute .
Parsing [sent. 4531 len. 15]: This is the very material that so many oriental tales have been made of .
Parsing [sent. 4532 len. 19]: The case of that great prince , the Gaikwar of Baroda , is a reversal of the theme .
Parsing [sent. 4533 len. 45]: When that throne fell vacant , no heir could be found for some time , but at last one was found in the person of a peasant child who was making mud pies in a village street , and having an innocent good time .
Parsing [sent. 4534 len. 26]: But his pedigree was straight ; he was the true prince , and he has reigned ever since , with none to dispute his right .
Parsing [sent. 4535 len. 27]: Lately there was another hunt for an heir to another princely house , and one was found who was circumstanced about as the Gaikwar had been .
Parsing [sent. 4536 len. 37]: His fathers were traced back , in humble life , along a branch of the ancestral tree to the point where it joined the stem fourteen generations ago , and his heirship was thereby squarely established .
Parsing [sent. 4537 len. 31]: The tracing was done by means of the records of one of the great Hindoo shrines , where princes on pilgrimage record their names and the date of their visit .
Parsing [sent. 4538 len. 32]: This is to keep the prince 's religious account straight , and his spiritual person safe ; but the record has the added value of keeping the pedigree authentic , too .
Parsing [sent. 4539 len. 78]: When I think of Bombay now , at this distance of time , I seem to have a kaleidoscope at my eye ; and I hear the clash of the glass bits as the splendid figures change , and fall apart , and flash into new forms , figure after figure , and with the birth of each new form I feel my skin crinkle and my nerve-web tingle with a new thrill of wonder and delight .
Parsing [sent. 4540 len. 58]: These remembered pictures float past me in a sequence of contracts ; following the same order always , and always whirling by and disappearing with the swiftness of a dream , leaving me with the sense that the actuality was the experience of an hour , at most , whereas it really covered days , I think .
Parsing [sent. 4541 len. 46]: The series begins with the hiring of a `` bearer '' -- native man-servant -- a person who should be selected with some care , because as long as he is in your employ he will be about as near to you as your clothes .
Parsing [sent. 4542 len. 41]: In India your day may be said to begin with the `` bearer 's '' knock on the bedroom door , accompanied by a formula of words -- a formula which is intended to mean that the bath is ready .
Parsing [sent. 4543 len. 11]: It does n't really seem to mean anything at all .
Parsing [sent. 4544 len. 14]: But that is because you are not used to `` bearer '' English .
Parsing [sent. 4545 len. 5]: You will presently understand .
Parsing [sent. 4546 len. 10]: Where he gets his English is his own secret .
Parsing [sent. 4547 len. 27]: There is nothing like it elsewhere in the earth ; or even in paradise , perhaps , but the other place is probably full of it .
Parsing [sent. 4548 len. 26]: You hire him as soon as you touch Indian soil ; for no matter what your sex is , you can not do without him .
Parsing [sent. 4549 len. 20]: He is messenger , valet , chambermaid , table-waiter , lady 's maid , courier -- he is everything .
Parsing [sent. 4550 len. 63]: He carries a coarse linen clothes-bag and a quilt ; he sleeps on the stone floor outside your chamber door , and gets his meals you do not know where nor when ; you only know that he is not fed on the premises , either when you are in a hotel or when you are a guest in a private house .
Parsing [sent. 4551 len. 22]: His wages are large -- from an Indian point of view -- and he feeds and clothes himself out of them .
Parsing [sent. 4552 len. 12]: We had three of him in two and a half months .
Parsing [sent. 4553 len. 28]: The first one 's rate was thirty rupees a month that is to say , twenty-seven cents a day ; the rate of the others , Rs .
Parsing [sent. 4554 len. 8]: 40 -LRB- 40 rupees -RRB- a month .
Parsing [sent. 4555 len. 23]: A princely sum ; for the native switchman on a railway and the native servant in a private family get only Rs .
Parsing [sent. 4556 len. 10]: 7 per month , and the farm-hand only 4 .
Parsing [sent. 4557 len. 34]: The two former feed and clothe themselves and their families on their $ 1.90 per month ; but I can not believe that the farmhand has to feed himself on his $ 1.08 .
Parsing [sent. 4558 len. 31]: I think the farm probably feeds him , and that the whole of his wages , except a trifle for the priest , go to the support of his family .
Parsing [sent. 4559 len. 41]: That is , to the feeding of his family ; for they live in a mud hut , hand-made , and , doubtless , rent-free , and they wear no clothes ; at least , nothing more than a rag .
Parsing [sent. 4560 len. 16]: And not much of a rag at that , in the case of the males .
Parsing [sent. 4561 len. 23]: However , these are handsome times for the farm-hand ; he was not always the child of luxury that he is now .
Parsing [sent. 4562 len. 68]: The Chief Commissioner of the Central Provinces , in a recent official utterance wherein he was rebuking a native deputation for complaining of hard times , reminded them that they could easily remember when a farm-hand 's wages were only half a rupee -LRB- former value -RRB- a month -- that is to say , less than a cent a day ; nearly $ 2.90 a year .
Parsing [sent. 4563 len. 68]: If such a wage-earner had a good deal of a family -- and they all have that , for God is very good to these poor natives in some ways -- he would save a profit of fifteen cents , clean and clear , out of his year 's toil ; I mean a frugal , thrifty person would , not one given to display and ostentation .
Parsing [sent. 4564 len. 23]: And if he owed $ 13.50 and took good care of his health , he could pay it off in ninety years .
Parsing [sent. 4565 len. 17]: Then he could hold up his head , and look his creditors in the face again .
Parsing [sent. 4566 len. 9]: Think of these facts and what they mean .
Parsing [sent. 4567 len. 7]: India does not consist of cities .
Parsing [sent. 4568 len. 11]: There are no cities in India -- to speak of .
Parsing [sent. 4569 len. 7]: Its stupendous population consists of farm-laborers .
Parsing [sent. 4570 len. 36]: India is one vast farm -- one almost interminable stretch of fields with mud fences between ... Think of the above facts ; and consider what an incredible aggregate of poverty they place before you .
Parsing [sent. 4571 len. 14]: The first Bearer that applied , waited below and sent up his recommendations .
Parsing [sent. 4572 len. 8]: That was the first morning in Bombay .
Parsing [sent. 4573 len. 11]: We read them over ; carefully , cautiously , thoughtfully .
Parsing [sent. 4574 len. 19]: There was not a fault to find with them -- except one ; they were all from Americans .
Parsing [sent. 4575 len. 5]: Is that a slur ?
Parsing [sent. 4576 len. 10]: If it is , it is a deserved one .
Parsing [sent. 4577 len. 16]: In my experience , an American 's recommendation of a servant is not usually valuable .
Parsing [sent. 4578 len. 71]: We are too good-natured a race ; we hate to say the unpleasant thing ; we shrink from speaking the unkind truth about a poor fellow whose bread depends upon our verdict ; so we speak of his good points only , thus not scrupling to tell a lie -- a silent lie -- for in not mentioning his bad ones we as good as say he has n't any .
Parsing [sent. 4579 len. 30]: The only difference that I know of between a silent lie and a spoken one is , that the silent lie is a less respectable one than the other .
Parsing [sent. 4580 len. 15]: And it can deceive , whereas the other ca n't -- as a rule .
Parsing [sent. 4581 len. 42]: We not only tell the silent lie as to a servant 's faults , but we sin in another way : we overpraise his merits ; for when it comes to writing recommendations of servants we are a nation of gushers .
Parsing [sent. 4582 len. 9]: And we have not the Frenchman 's excuse .
Parsing [sent. 4583 len. 24]: In France you must give the departing servant a good recommendation ; and you must conceal his faults ; you have no choice .
Parsing [sent. 4584 len. 64]: If you mention his faults for the protection of the next candidate for his services , he can sue you for damages ; and the court will award them , too ; and , moreover , the judge will give you a sharp dressing-down from the bench for trying to destroy a poor man 's character , and rob him of his bread .
Parsing [sent. 4585 len. 38]: I do not state this on my own authority , I got it from a French physician of fame and repute -- a man who was born in Paris , and had practiced there all his life .
Parsing [sent. 4586 len. 18]: And he said that he spoke not merely from common knowledge , but from exasperating personal experience .
Parsing [sent. 4587 len. 50]: As I was saying , the Bearer 's recommendations were all from American tourists ; and St. Peter would have admitted him to the fields of the blest on them -- I mean if he is as unfamiliar with our people and our ways as I suppose he is .
Parsing [sent. 4588 len. 30]: According to these recommendations , Manuel X. was supreme in all the arts connected with his complex trade ; and these manifold arts were mentioned -- and praised-in detail .
Parsing [sent. 4589 len. 16]: His English was spoken of in terms of warm admiration -- admiration verging upon rapture .
Parsing [sent. 4590 len. 17]: I took pleased note of that , and hoped that some of it might be true .
Parsing [sent. 4591 len. 35]: We had to have some one right away ; so the family went down stairs and took him a week on trial ; then sent him up to me and departed on their affairs .
Parsing [sent. 4592 len. 28]: I was shut up in my quarters with a bronchial cough , and glad to have something fresh to look at , something new to play with .
Parsing [sent. 4593 len. 10]: Manuel filled the bill ; Manuel was very welcome .
Parsing [sent. 4594 len. 64]: He was toward fifty years old , tall , slender , with a slight stoop -- an artificial stoop , a deferential stoop , a stoop rigidified by long habit -- with face of European mould ; short hair intensely black ; gentle black eyes , timid black eyes , indeed ; complexion very dark , nearly black in fact ; face smooth-shaven .
Parsing [sent. 4595 len. 31]: He was bareheaded and barefooted , and was never otherwise while his week with us lasted ; his clothing was European , cheap , flimsy , and showed much wear .
Parsing [sent. 4596 len. 32]: He stood before me and inclined his head -LRB- and body -RRB- in the pathetic Indian way , touching his forehead with the finger-ends of his right hand , in salute .
Parsing [sent. 4597 len. 26]: I said : `` Manuel , you are evidently Indian , but you seem to have a Spanish name when you put it all together .
Parsing [sent. 4598 len. 5]: How is that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4599 len. 24]: A perplexed look gathered in his face ; it was plain that he had not understood -- but he did n't let on .
Parsing [sent. 4600 len. 5]: He spoke back placidly .
Parsing [sent. 4601 len. 5]: `` Name , Manuel .
Parsing [sent. 4602 len. 5]: Yes , master . ''
Parsing [sent. 4603 len. 13]: `` I know ; but how did you get the name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4604 len. 8]: `` Oh , yes , I suppose .
Parsing [sent. 4605 len. 4]: Think happen so .
Parsing [sent. 4606 len. 8]: Father same name , not mother . ''
Parsing [sent. 4607 len. 24]: I saw that I must simplify my language and spread my words apart , if I would be understood by this English scholar .
Parsing [sent. 4608 len. 19]: `` Well -- then -- how -- did -- your -- father -- get -- his name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4609 len. 45]: `` Oh , he , '' -- brightening a little -- `` he Christian -- Portygee ; live in Goa ; I born Goa ; mother not Portygee , mother native-high-caste Brahmin -- Coolin Brahmin ; highest caste ; no other so high caste .
Parsing [sent. 4610 len. 6]: I high-caste Brahmin , too .
Parsing [sent. 4611 len. 18]: Christian , too , same like father ; high-caste Christian Brahmin , master -- Salvation Army . ''
Parsing [sent. 4612 len. 8]: All this haltingly , and with difficulty .
Parsing [sent. 4613 len. 34]: Then he had an inspiration , and began to pour out a flood of words that I could make nothing of ; so I said : `` There -- do n't do that .
Parsing [sent. 4614 len. 7]: I ca n't understand Hindostani . ''
Parsing [sent. 4615 len. 8]: `` Not Hindostani , master -- English .
Parsing [sent. 4616 len. 17]: Always I speaking English sometimes when I talking every day all the time at you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4617 len. 12]: `` Very well , stick to that ; that is intelligible .
Parsing [sent. 4618 len. 29]: It is not up to my hopes , it is not up to the promise of the recommendations , still it is English , and I understand it .
Parsing [sent. 4619 len. 20]: Do n't elaborate it ; I do n't like elaborations when they are crippled by uncertainty of touch . ''
Parsing [sent. 4620 len. 4]: `` Master ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4621 len. 22]: `` Oh , never mind ; it was only a random thought ; I did n't expect you to understand it .
Parsing [sent. 4622 len. 20]: How did you get your English ; is it an acquirement , or just a gift of God ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4623 len. 13]: After some hesitation -- piously : `` Yes , he very good .
Parsing [sent. 4624 len. 12]: Christian god very good , Hindoo god very good , too .
Parsing [sent. 4625 len. 15]: Two million Hindoo god , one Christian god -- make two million and one .
Parsing [sent. 4626 len. 9]: All mine ; two million and one god .
Parsing [sent. 4627 len. 5]: I got a plenty .
Parsing [sent. 4628 len. 46]: Sometime I pray all time at those , keep it up , go all time every day ; give something at shrine , all good for me , make me better man ; good for me , good for my family , dam good . ''
Parsing [sent. 4629 len. 24]: Then he had another inspiration , and went rambling off into fervent confusions and incoherencies , and I had to stop him again .
Parsing [sent. 4630 len. 32]: I thought we had talked enough , so I told him to go to the bathroom and clean it up and remove the slops -- this to get rid of him .
Parsing [sent. 4631 len. 21]: He went away , seeming to understand , and got out some of my clothes and began to brush them .
Parsing [sent. 4632 len. 20]: I repeated my desire several times , simplifying and re-simplifying it , and at last he got the idea .
Parsing [sent. 4633 len. 56]: Then he went away and put a coolie at the work , and explained that he would lose caste if he did it himself ; it would be pollution , by the law of his caste , and it would cost him a deal of fuss and trouble to purify himself and accomplish his rehabilitation .
Parsing [sent. 4634 len. 41]: He said that that kind of work was strictly forbidden to persons of caste , and as strictly restricted to the very bottom layer of Hindoo society -- the despised ` Sudra ' -LRB- the toiler , the laborer -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 4635 len. 38]: He was right ; and apparently the poor Sudra has been content with his strange lot , his insulting distinction , for ages and ages -- clear back to the beginning of things , so to speak .
Parsing [sent. 4636 len. 67]: Buckle says that his name -- laborer -- is a term of contempt ; that it is ordained by the Institutes of Menu -LRB- 900 B.C. -RRB- that if a Sudra sit on a level with his superior he shall be exiled or branded -- -LSB- Without going into particulars I will remark that as a rule they wear no clothing that would conceal the brand .
Parsing [sent. 4637 len. 7]: -- M. T. -RSB- . . .
Parsing [sent. 4638 len. 85]: if he speak contemptuously of his superior or insult him he shall suffer death ; if he listen to the reading of the sacred books he shall have burning oil poured in his ears ; if he memorize passages from them he shall be killed ; if he marry his daughter to a Brahmin the husband shall go to hell for defiling himself by contact with a woman so infinitely his inferior ; and that it is forbidden to a Sudra to acquire wealth .
Parsing [sent. 4639 len. 20]: `` The bulk of the population of India , '' says Bucklet -- -LSB- Population to-day , 300,000,000 . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 4640 len. 18]: -- `` is the Sudras -- the workers , the farmers , the creators of wealth . ''
Parsing [sent. 4641 len. 9]: Manuel was a failure , poor old fellow .
Parsing [sent. 4642 len. 6]: His age was against him .
Parsing [sent. 4643 len. 8]: He was desperately slow and phenomenally forgetful .
Parsing [sent. 4644 len. 25]: When he went three blocks on an errand he would be gone two hours , and then forget what it was he went for .
Parsing [sent. 4645 len. 24]: When he packed a trunk it took him forever , and the trunk 's contents were an unimaginable chaos when he got done .
Parsing [sent. 4646 len. 39]: He could n't wait satisfactorily at table -- a prime defect , for if you have n't your own servant in an Indian hotel you are likely to have a slow time of it and go away hungry .
Parsing [sent. 4647 len. 33]: We could n't understand his English ; he could n't understand ours ; and when we found that he could n't understand his own , it seemed time for us to part .
Parsing [sent. 4648 len. 13]: I had to discharge him ; there was no help for it .
Parsing [sent. 4649 len. 14]: But I did it as kindly as I could , and as gently .
Parsing [sent. 4650 len. 19]: We must part , said I , but I hoped we should meet again in a better world .
Parsing [sent. 4651 len. 24]: It was not true , but it was only a little thing to say , and saved his feelings and cost me nothing .
Parsing [sent. 4652 len. 38]: But now that he was gone , and was off my mind and heart , my spirits began to rise at once , and I was soon feeling brisk and ready to go out and have adventures .
Parsing [sent. 4653 len. 61]: Then his newly-hired successor flitted in , touched his forehead , and began to fly around here , there , and everywhere , on his velvet feet , and in five minutes he had everything in the room `` ship-shape and Bristol fashion , '' as the sailors say , and was standing at the salute , waiting for orders .
Parsing [sent. 4654 len. 19]: Dear me , what a rustler he was after the slumbrous way of Manuel , poor old slug !
Parsing [sent. 4655 len. 70]: All my heart , all my affection , all my admiration , went out spontaneously to this frisky little forked black thing , this compact and compressed incarnation of energy and force and promptness and celerity and confidence , this smart , smily , engaging , shiney-eyed little devil , feruled on his upper end by a gleaming fire-coal of a fez with a red-hot tassel dangling from it .
Parsing [sent. 4656 len. 12]: I said , with deep satisfaction -- `` You 'll suit .
Parsing [sent. 4657 len. 6]: What is your name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4658 len. 6]: He reeled it mellowly off .
Parsing [sent. 4659 len. 29]: `` Let me see if I can make a selection out of it -- for business uses , I mean ; we will keep the rest for Sundays .
Parsing [sent. 4660 len. 8]: Give it to me in installments . ''
Parsing [sent. 4661 len. 4]: He did it .
Parsing [sent. 4662 len. 18]: But there did not seem to be any short ones , except Mousa -- which suggested mouse .
Parsing [sent. 4663 len. 25]: It was out of character ; it was too soft , too quiet , too conservative ; it did n't fit his splendid style .
Parsing [sent. 4664 len. 20]: I considered , and said -- `` Mousa is short enough , but I do n't quite like it .
Parsing [sent. 4665 len. 16]: It seems colorless -- inharmonious -- inadequate ; and I am sensitive to such things .
Parsing [sent. 4666 len. 9]: How do you think Satan would do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4667 len. 5]: `` Yes , master .
Parsing [sent. 4668 len. 6]: Satan do wair good . ''
Parsing [sent. 4669 len. 11]: It was his way of saying `` very good . ''
Parsing [sent. 4670 len. 8]: There was a rap at the door .
Parsing [sent. 4671 len. 22]: Satan covered the ground with a single skip ; there was a word or two of Hindostani , then he disappeared .
Parsing [sent. 4672 len. 20]: Three minutes later he was before me again , militarily erect , and waiting for me to speak first .
Parsing [sent. 4673 len. 8]: `` What is it , Satan ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4674 len. 8]: `` God want to see you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4675 len. 4]: `` Who ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4676 len. 3]: `` God .
Parsing [sent. 4677 len. 8]: I show him up , master ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4678 len. 32]: `` Why , this is so unusual , that -- that -- well , you see indeed I am so unprepared -- I do n't quite know what I do mean .
Parsing [sent. 4679 len. 8]: Dear me , ca n't you explain ?
Parsing [sent. 4680 len. 20]: Do n't you see that this is a most ex -- '' `` Here his card , master . ''
Parsing [sent. 4681 len. 15]: Was n't it curious -- and amazing , and tremendous , and all that ?
Parsing [sent. 4682 len. 27]: Such a personage going around calling on such as I , and sending up his card , like a mortal -- sending it up by Satan .
Parsing [sent. 4683 len. 9]: It was a bewildering collision of the impossibles .
Parsing [sent. 4684 len. 14]: But this was the land of the Arabian Nights , this was India !
Parsing [sent. 4685 len. 11]: and what is it that can not happen in India ?
Parsing [sent. 4686 len. 5]: We had the interview .
Parsing [sent. 4687 len. 29]: Satan was right -- the Visitor was indeed a God in the conviction of his multitudinous followers , and was worshiped by them in sincerity and humble adoration .
Parsing [sent. 4688 len. 14]: They are troubled by no doubts as to his divine origin and office .
Parsing [sent. 4689 len. 62]: They believe in him , they pray to him , they make offerings to him , they beg of him remission of sins ; to them his person , together with everything connected with it , is sacred ; from his barber they buy the parings of his nails and set them in gold , and wear them as precious amulets .
Parsing [sent. 4690 len. 15]: I tried to seem tranquilly conversational and at rest , but I was not .
Parsing [sent. 4691 len. 5]: Would you have been ?
Parsing [sent. 4692 len. 14]: I was in a suppressed frenzy of excitement and curiosity and glad wonder .
Parsing [sent. 4693 len. 9]: I could not keep my eyes off him .
Parsing [sent. 4694 len. 33]: I was looking upon a god , an actual god , a recognized and accepted god ; and every detail of his person and his dress had a consuming interest for me .
Parsing [sent. 4695 len. 54]: And the thought went floating through my head , `` He is worshiped -- think of it -- he is not a recipient of the pale homage called compliment , wherewith the highest human clay must make shift to be satisfied , but of an infinitely richer spiritual food : adoration , worship !
Parsing [sent. 4696 len. 32]: -- men and women lay their cares and their griefs and their broken hearts at his feet ; and he gives them his peace ; and they go away healed . ''
Parsing [sent. 4697 len. 42]: And just then the Awful Visitor said , in the simplest way -- `` There is a feature of the philosophy of Huck Finn which '' -- and went luminously on with the construction of a compact and nicely-discriminated literary verdict .
Parsing [sent. 4698 len. 9]: It is a land of surprises -- India !
Parsing [sent. 4699 len. 34]: I had had my ambitions -- I had hoped , and almost expected , to be read by kings and presidents and emperors -- but I had never looked so high as That .
Parsing [sent. 4700 len. 14]: It would be false modesty to pretend that I was not inordinately pleased .
Parsing [sent. 4701 len. 3]: I was .
Parsing [sent. 4702 len. 17]: I was much more pleased than I should have been with a compliment from a man .
Parsing [sent. 4703 len. 17]: He remained half an hour , and I found him a most courteous and charming gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 4704 len. 19]: The godship has been in his family a good while , but I do not know how long .
Parsing [sent. 4705 len. 22]: He is a Mohammedan deity ; by earthly rank he is a prince ; not an Indian but a Persian prince .
Parsing [sent. 4706 len. 11]: He is a direct descendant of the Prophet 's line .
Parsing [sent. 4707 len. 21]: He is comely ; also young -- for a god ; not forty , perhaps not above thirty-five years old .
Parsing [sent. 4708 len. 19]: He wears his immense honors with tranquil grace , and with a dignity proper to his awful calling .
Parsing [sent. 4709 len. 15]: He speaks English with the ease and purity of a person born to it .
Parsing [sent. 4710 len. 8]: I think I am not overstating this .
Parsing [sent. 4711 len. 17]: He was the only god I had ever seen , and I was very favorably impressed .
Parsing [sent. 4712 len. 36]: When he rose to say good-bye , the door swung open and I caught the flash of a red fez , and heard these words , reverently said -- `` Satan see God out ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4713 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 4714 len. 17]: And these mis-mated Beings passed from view Satan in the lead and The Other following after .
Parsing [sent. 4715 len. 3]: CHAPTER XL .
Parsing [sent. 4716 len. 7]: Few of us can stand prosperity .
Parsing [sent. 4717 len. 7]: Another man 's , I mean .
Parsing [sent. 4718 len. 9]: -- Pudd ` nhead Wilson 's New Calendar .
Parsing [sent. 4719 len. 62]: The next picture in my mind is Government House , on Malabar Point , with the wide sea-view from the windows and broad balconies ; abode of His Excellency the Governor of the Bombay Presidency -- a residence which is European in everything but the native guards and servants , and is a home and a palace of state harmoniously combined .
Parsing [sent. 4720 len. 38]: That was England , the English power , the English civilization , the modern civilization -- with the quiet elegancies and quiet colors and quiet tastes and quiet dignity that are the outcome of the modern cultivation .
Parsing [sent. 4721 len. 32]: And following it came a picture of the ancient civilization of India -- an hour in the mansion of a native prince : Kumar Schri Samatsinhji Bahadur of the Palitana State .
Parsing [sent. 4722 len. 85]: The young lad , his heir , was with the prince ; also , the lad 's sister , a wee brown sprite , very pretty , very serious , very winning , delicately moulded , costumed like the daintiest butterfly , a dear little fairyland princess , gravely willing to be friendly with the strangers , but in the beginning preferring to hold her father 's hand until she could take stock of them and determine how far they were to be trusted .
Parsing [sent. 4723 len. 100]: She must have been eight years old ; so in the natural -LRB- Indian -RRB- order of things she would be a bride in three or four years from now , and then this free contact with the sun and the air and the other belongings of out-door nature and comradeship with visiting male folk would end , and she would shut herself up in the zenana for life , like her mother , and by inherited habit of mind would be happy in that seclusion and not look upon it as an irksome restraint and a weary captivity .
Parsing [sent. 4724 len. 26]: The game which the prince amuses his leisure with -- however , never mind it , I should never be able to describe it intelligibly .
Parsing [sent. 4725 len. 40]: I tried to get an idea of it while my wife and daughter visited the princess in the zenana , a lady of charming graces and a fluent speaker of English , but I did not make it out .
Parsing [sent. 4726 len. 25]: It is a complicated game , and I believe it is said that nobody can learn to play it well -- but an Indian .
Parsing [sent. 4727 len. 13]: And I was not able to learn how to wind a turban .
Parsing [sent. 4728 len. 14]: It seemed a simple art and easy ; but that was a deception .
Parsing [sent. 4729 len. 79]: It is a piece of thin , delicate stuff a foot wide or more , and forty or fifty feet long ; and the exhibitor of the art takes one end of it in his two hands , and winds it in and out intricately about his head , twisting it as he goes , and in a minute or two the thing is finished , and is neat and symmetrical and fits as snugly as a mould .
Parsing [sent. 4730 len. 27]: We were interested in the wardrobe and the jewels , and in the silverware , and its grace of shape and beauty and delicacy of ornamentation .
Parsing [sent. 4731 len. 26]: The silverware is kept locked up , except at meal-times , and none but the chief butler and the prince have keys to the safe .
Parsing [sent. 4732 len. 18]: I did not clearly understand why , but it was not for the protection of the silver .
Parsing [sent. 4733 len. 34]: It was either to protect the prince from the contamination which his caste would suffer if the vessels were touched by low-caste hands , or it was to protect his highness from poison .
Parsing [sent. 4734 len. 5]: Possibly it was both .
Parsing [sent. 4735 len. 47]: I believe a salaried taster has to taste everything before the prince ventures it -- an ancient and judicious custom in the East , and has thinned out the tasters a good deal , for of course it is the cook that puts the poison in .
Parsing [sent. 4736 len. 24]: If I were an Indian prince I would not go to the expense of a taster , I would eat with the cook .
Parsing [sent. 4737 len. 24]: Ceremonials are always interesting ; and I noted that the Indian good-morning is a ceremonial , whereas ours does n't amount to that .
Parsing [sent. 4738 len. 37]: In salutation the son reverently touches the father 's forehead with a small silver implement tipped with vermillion paste which leaves a red spot there , and in return the son receives the father 's blessing .
Parsing [sent. 4739 len. 25]: Our good morning is well enough for the rowdy West , perhaps , but would be too brusque for the soft and ceremonious East .
Parsing [sent. 4740 len. 64]: After being properly necklaced , according to custom , with great garlands made of yellow flowers , and provided with betel-nut to chew , this pleasant visit closed , and we passed thence to a scene of a different sort : from this glow of color and this sunny life to those grim receptacles of the Parsee dead , the Towers of Silence .
Parsing [sent. 4741 len. 23]: There is something stately about that name , and an impressiveness which sinks deep ; the hush of death is in it .
Parsing [sent. 4742 len. 53]: We have the Grave , the Tomb , the Mausoleum , God 's Acre , the Cemetery ; and association has made them eloquent with solemn meaning ; but we have no name that is so majestic as that one , or lingers upon the ear with such deep and haunting pathos .
Parsing [sent. 4743 len. 82]: On lofty ground , in the midst of a paradise of tropical foliage and flowers , remote from the world and its turmoil and noise , they stood -- the Towers of Silence ; and away below was spread the wide groves of cocoa palms , then the city , mile on mile , then the ocean with its fleets of creeping ships all steeped in a stillness as deep as the hush that hallowed this high place of the dead .
Parsing [sent. 4744 len. 5]: The vultures were there .
Parsing [sent. 4745 len. 42]: They stood close together in a great circle all around the rim of a massive low tower -- waiting ; stood as motionless as sculptured ornaments , and indeed almost deceived one into the belief that that was what they were .
Parsing [sent. 4746 len. 26]: Presently there was a slight stir among the score of persons present , and all moved reverently out of the path and ceased from talking .
Parsing [sent. 4747 len. 22]: A funeral procession entered the great gate , marching two and two , and moved silently by , toward the Tower .
Parsing [sent. 4748 len. 22]: The corpse lay in a shallow shell , and was under cover of a white cloth , but was otherwise naked .
Parsing [sent. 4749 len. 17]: The bearers of the body were separated by an interval of thirty feet from the mourners .
Parsing [sent. 4750 len. 45]: They , and also the mourners , were draped all in pure white , and each couple of mourners was figuratively bound together by a piece of white rope or a handkerchief -- though they merely held the ends of it in their hands .
Parsing [sent. 4751 len. 14]: Behind the procession followed a dog , which was led in a leash .
Parsing [sent. 4752 len. 55]: When the mourners had reached the neighborhood of the Tower -- neither they nor any other human being but the bearers of the dead must approach within thirty feet of it -- they turned and went back to one of the prayer-houses within the gates , to pray for the spirit of their dead .
Parsing [sent. 4753 len. 14]: The bearers unlocked the Tower 's sole door and disappeared from view within .
Parsing [sent. 4754 len. 21]: In a little while they came out bringing the bier and the white covering-cloth , and locked the door again .
Parsing [sent. 4755 len. 22]: Then the ring of vultures rose , flapping their wings , and swooped down into the Tower to devour the body .
Parsing [sent. 4756 len. 18]: Nothing was left of it but a clean-picked skeleton when they flocked-out again a few minutes afterward .
Parsing [sent. 4757 len. 15]: The principle which underlies and orders everything connected with a Parsee funeral is Purity .
Parsing [sent. 4758 len. 33]: By the tenets of the Zoroastrian religion , the elements , Earth , Fire , and Water , are sacred , and must not be contaminated by contact with a dead body .
Parsing [sent. 4759 len. 13]: Hence corpses must not be burned , neither must they be buried .
Parsing [sent. 4760 len. 23]: None may touch the dead or enter the Towers where they repose except certain men who are officially appointed for that purpose .
Parsing [sent. 4761 len. 42]: They receive high pay , but theirs is a dismal life , for they must live apart from their species , because their commerce with the dead defiles them , and any who should associate with them would share their defilement .
Parsing [sent. 4762 len. 55]: When they come out of the Tower the clothes they are wearing are exchanged for others , in a building within the grounds , and the ones which they have taken off are left behind , for they are contaminated , and must never be used again or suffered to go outside the grounds .
Parsing [sent. 4763 len. 10]: These bearers come to every funeral in new garments .
Parsing [sent. 4764 len. 30]: So far as is known , no human being , other than an official corpse-bearer -- save one -- has ever entered a Tower of Silence after its consecration .
Parsing [sent. 4765 len. 28]: Just a hundred years ago a European rushed in behind the bearers and fed his brutal curiosity with a glimpse of the forbidden mysteries of the place .
Parsing [sent. 4766 len. 15]: This shabby savage 's name is not given ; his quality is also concealed .
Parsing [sent. 4767 len. 46]: These two details , taken in connection with the fact that for his extraordinary offense the only punishment he got from the East India Company 's Government was a solemn official `` reprimand '' -- suggest the suspicion that he was a European of consequence .
Parsing [sent. 4768 len. 41]: The same public document which contained the reprimand gave warning that future offenders of his sort , if in the Company 's service , would be dismissed ; and if merchants , suffer revocation of license and exile to England .
Parsing [sent. 4769 len. 19]: The Towers are not tall , but are low in proportion to their circumference , like a gasometer .
Parsing [sent. 4770 len. 42]: If you should fill a gasometer half way up with solid granite masonry , then drive a wide and deep well down through the center of this mass of masonry , you would have the idea of a Tower of Silence .
Parsing [sent. 4771 len. 21]: On the masonry surrounding the well the bodies lie , in shallow trenches which radiate like wheel-spokes from the well .
Parsing [sent. 4772 len. 13]: The trenches slant toward the well and carry into it the rainfall .
Parsing [sent. 4773 len. 20]: Underground drains , with charcoal filters in them , carry off this water from the bottom of the well .
Parsing [sent. 4774 len. 25]: When a skeleton has lain in the Tower exposed to the rain and the flaming sun a month it is perfectly dry and clean .
Parsing [sent. 4775 len. 23]: Then the same bearers that brought it there come gloved and take it up with tongs and throw it into the well .
Parsing [sent. 4776 len. 6]: There it turns to dust .
Parsing [sent. 4777 len. 14]: It is never seen again , never touched again , in the world .
Parsing [sent. 4778 len. 74]: Other peoples separate their dead , and preserve and continue social distinctions in the grave -- the skeletons of kings and statesmen and generals in temples and pantheons proper to skeletons of their degree , and the skeletons of the commonplace and the poor in places suited to their meaner estate ; but the Parsees hold that all men rank alike in death -- all are humble , all poor , all destitute .
Parsing [sent. 4779 len. 40]: In sign of their poverty they are sent to their grave naked , in sign of their equality the bones of the rich , the poor , the illustrious and the obscure are flung into the common well together .
Parsing [sent. 4780 len. 29]: At a Parsee funeral there are no vehicles ; all concerned must walk , both rich and poor , howsoever great the distance to be traversed may be .
Parsing [sent. 4781 len. 55]: In the wells of the Five Towers of Silence is mingled the dust of all the Parsee men and women and children who have died in Bombay and its vicinity during the two centuries which have elapsed since the Mohammedan conquerors drove the Parsees out of Persia , and into that region of India .
Parsing [sent. 4782 len. 42]: The earliest of the five towers was built by the Modi family something more than 200 years ago , and it is now reserved to the heirs of that house ; none but the dead of that blood are carried thither .
Parsing [sent. 4783 len. 24]: The origin of at least one of the details of a Parsee funeral is not now known -- the presence of the dog .
Parsing [sent. 4784 len. 36]: Before a corpse is borne from the house of mourning it must be uncovered and exposed to the gaze of a dog ; a dog must also be led in the rear of the funeral .
Parsing [sent. 4785 len. 39]: Mr. Nusserwanjee Byramjee , Secretary to the Parsee Punchayet , said that these formalities had once had a meaning and a reason for their institution , but that they were survivals whose origin none could now account for .
Parsing [sent. 4786 len. 12]: Custom and tradition continue them in force , antiquity hallows them .
Parsing [sent. 4787 len. 61]: It is thought that in ancient times in Persia the dog was a sacred animal and could guide souls to heaven ; also that his eye had the power of purifying objects which had been contaminated by the touch of the dead ; and that hence his presence with the funeral cortege provides an ever-applicable remedy in case of need .
Parsing [sent. 4788 len. 70]: The Parsees claim that their method of disposing of the dead is an effective protection of the living ; that it disseminates no corruption , no impurities of any sort , no disease-germs ; that no wrap , no garment which has touched the dead is allowed to touch the living afterward ; that from the Towers of Silence nothing proceeds which can carry harm to the outside world .
Parsing [sent. 4789 len. 8]: These are just claims , I think .
Parsing [sent. 4790 len. 20]: As a sanitary measure , their system seems to be about the equivalent of cremation , and as sure .
Parsing [sent. 4791 len. 14]: We are drifting slowly -- but hopefully -- toward cremation in these days .
Parsing [sent. 4792 len. 28]: It could not be expected that this progress should be swift , but if it be steady and continuous , even if slow , that will suffice .
Parsing [sent. 4793 len. 31]: When cremation becomes the rule we shall cease to shudder at it ; we should shudder at burial if we allowed ourselves to think what goes on in the grave .
Parsing [sent. 4794 len. 20]: The dog was an impressive figure to me , representing as he did a mystery whose key is lost .
Parsing [sent. 4795 len. 47]: He was humble , and apparently depressed ; and he let his head droop pensively , and looked as if he might be trying to call back to his mind what it was that he had used to symbolize ages ago when he began his function .
Parsing [sent. 4796 len. 18]: There was another impressive thing close at hand , but I was not privileged to see it .
Parsing [sent. 4797 len. 40]: That was the sacred fire -- a fire which is supposed to have been burning without interruption for more than two centuries ; and so , living by the same heat that was imparted to it so long ago .
Parsing [sent. 4798 len. 7]: The Parsees are a remarkable community .
Parsing [sent. 4799 len. 34]: There are only about 60,000 in Bombay , and only about half as many as that in the rest of India ; but they make up in importance what they lack in numbers .
Parsing [sent. 4800 len. 29]: They are highly educated , energetic , enterprising , progressive , rich , and the Jew himself is not more lavish or catholic in his charities and benevolences .
Parsing [sent. 4801 len. 29]: The Parsees build and endow hospitals , for both men and animals ; and they and their womenkind keep an open purse for all great and good objects .
Parsing [sent. 4802 len. 14]: They are a political force , and a valued support to the government .
Parsing [sent. 4803 len. 22]: They have a pure and lofty religion , and they preserve it in its integrity and order their lives by it .
Parsing [sent. 4804 len. 87]: We took a final sweep of the wonderful view of plain and city and ocean , and so ended our visit to the garden and the Towers of Silence ; and the last thing I noticed was another symbol -- a voluntary symbol this one ; it was a vulture standing on the sawed-off top of a tall and slender and branchless palm in an open space in the ground ; he was perfectly motionless , and looked like a piece of sculpture on a pillar .
Parsing [sent. 4805 len. 17]: And he had a mortuary look , too , which was in keeping with the place .
Parsing [sent. 4806 len. 3]: CHAPTER XLI .
Parsing [sent. 4807 len. 12]: There is an old-time toast which is golden for its beauty .
Parsing [sent. 4808 len. 16]: `` When you ascend the hill of prosperity may you not meet a friend . ''
Parsing [sent. 4809 len. 9]: -- Pudd ` nhead Wilson 's New Calendar .
Parsing [sent. 4810 len. 20]: The next picture that drifts across the field of my memory is one which is connected with religious things .
Parsing [sent. 4811 len. 11]: We were taken by friends to see a Jain temple .
Parsing [sent. 4812 len. 31]: It was small , and had many flags or streamers flying from poles standing above its roof ; and its little battlements supported a great many small idols or images .
Parsing [sent. 4813 len. 19]: Upstairs , inside , a solitary Jain was praying or reciting aloud in the middle of the room .
Parsing [sent. 4814 len. 16]: Our presence did not interrupt him , nor even incommode him or modify his fervor .
Parsing [sent. 4815 len. 20]: Ten or twelve feet in front of him was the idol , a small figure in a sitting posture .
Parsing [sent. 4816 len. 29]: It had the pinkish look of a wax doll , but lacked the doll 's roundness of limb and approximation to correctness of form and justness of proportion .
Parsing [sent. 4817 len. 8]: Mr. Gandhi explained every thing to us .
Parsing [sent. 4818 len. 11]: He was delegate to the Chicago Fair Congress of Religions .
Parsing [sent. 4819 len. 80]: It was lucidly done , in masterly English , but in time it faded from me , and now I have nothing left of that episode but an impression : a dim idea of a religious belief clothed in subtle intellectual forms , lofty and clean , barren of fleshly grossnesses ; and with this another dim impression which connects that intellectual system somehow with that crude image , that inadequate idol -- how , I do not know .
Parsing [sent. 4820 len. 9]: Properly they do not seem to belong together .
Parsing [sent. 4821 len. 54]: Apparently the idol symbolized a person who had become a saint or a god through accessions of steadily augmenting holiness acquired through a series of reincarnations and promotions extending over many ages ; and was now at last a saint and qualified to vicariously receive worship and transmit it to heaven 's chancellery .
Parsing [sent. 4822 len. 4]: Was that it ?
Parsing [sent. 4823 len. 52]: And thence we went to Mr. Premchand Roychand 's bungalow , in Lovelane , Byculla , where an Indian prince was to receive a deputation of the Jain community who desired to congratulate him upon a high honor lately conferred upon him by his sovereign , Victoria , Empress of India .
Parsing [sent. 4824 len. 15]: She had made him a knight of the order of the Star of India .
Parsing [sent. 4825 len. 36]: It would seem that even the grandest Indian prince is glad to add the modest title `` Sir '' to his ancient native grandeurs , and is willing to do valuable service to win it .
Parsing [sent. 4826 len. 32]: He will remit taxes liberally , and will spend money freely upon the betterment of the condition of his subjects , if there is a knighthood to be gotten by it .
Parsing [sent. 4827 len. 27]: And he will also do good work and a deal of it to get a gun added to the salute allowed him by the British Government .
Parsing [sent. 4828 len. 17]: Every year the Empress distributes knighthoods and adds guns for public services done by native princes .
Parsing [sent. 4829 len. 51]: The salute of a small prince is three or four guns ; princes of greater consequence have salutes that run higher and higher , gun by gun , -- oh , clear away up to eleven ; possibly more , but I did not hear of any above eleven-gun princes .
Parsing [sent. 4830 len. 43]: I was told that when a four-gun prince gets a gun added , he is pretty troublesome for a while , till the novelty wears off , for he likes the music , and keeps hunting up pretexts to get himself saluted .
Parsing [sent. 4831 len. 31]: It may be that supremely grand folk , like the Nyzam of Hyderabad and the Gaikwar of Baroda , have more than eleven guns , but I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 4832 len. 28]: When we arrived at the bungalow , the large hall on the ground floor was already about full , and carriages were still flowing into the grounds .
Parsing [sent. 4833 len. 29]: The company present made a fine show , an exhibition of human fireworks , so to speak , in the matters of costume and comminglings of brilliant color .
Parsing [sent. 4834 len. 13]: The variety of form noticeable in the display of turbans was remarkable .
Parsing [sent. 4835 len. 38]: We were told that the explanation of this was , that this Jain delegation was drawn from many parts of India , and that each man wore the turban that was in vogue in his own region .
Parsing [sent. 4836 len. 9]: This diversity of turbans made a beautiful effect .
Parsing [sent. 4837 len. 17]: I could have wished to start a rival exhibition there , of Christian hats and clothes .
Parsing [sent. 4838 len. 48]: I would have cleared one side of the room of its Indian splendors and repacked the space with Christians drawn from America , England , and the Colonies , dressed in the hats and habits of now , and of twenty and forty and fifty years ago .
Parsing [sent. 4839 len. 13]: It would have been a hideous exhibition , a thoroughly devilish spectacle .
Parsing [sent. 4840 len. 13]: Then there would have been the added disadvantage of the white complexion .
Parsing [sent. 4841 len. 41]: It is not an unbearably unpleasant complexion when it keeps to itself , but when it comes into competition with masses of brown and black the fact is betrayed that it is endurable only because we are used to it .
Parsing [sent. 4842 len. 17]: Nearly all black and brown skins are beautiful , but a beautiful white skin is rare .
Parsing [sent. 4843 len. 43]: How rare , one may learn by walking down a street in Paris , New York , or London on a week-day -- particularly an unfashionable street -- and keeping count of the satisfactory complexions encountered in the course of a mile .
Parsing [sent. 4844 len. 20]: Where dark complexions are massed , they make the whites look bleached-out , unwholesome , and sometimes frankly ghastly .
Parsing [sent. 4845 len. 18]: I could notice this as a boy , down South in the slavery days before the war .
Parsing [sent. 4846 len. 22]: The splendid black satin skin of the South African Zulus of Durban seemed to me to come very close to perfection .
Parsing [sent. 4847 len. 43]: I can see those Zulus yet -- ` ricksha athletes waiting in front of the hotel for custom ; handsome and intensely black creatures , moderately clothed in loose summer stuffs whose snowy whiteness made the black all the blacker by contrast .
Parsing [sent. 4848 len. 28]: Keeping that group in my mind , I can compare those complexions with the white ones which are streaming past this London window now : A lady .
Parsing [sent. 4849 len. 5]: Complexion , new parchment .
Parsing [sent. 4850 len. 3]: Another lady .
Parsing [sent. 4851 len. 5]: Complexion , old parchment .
Parsing [sent. 4852 len. 2]: Another .
Parsing [sent. 4853 len. 7]: Pink and white , very fine .
Parsing [sent. 4854 len. 2]: Man .
Parsing [sent. 4855 len. 7]: Grayish skin , with purple areas .
Parsing [sent. 4856 len. 2]: Man .
Parsing [sent. 4857 len. 4]: Unwholesome fish-belly skin .
Parsing [sent. 4858 len. 2]: Girl .
Parsing [sent. 4859 len. 7]: Sallow face , sprinkled with freckles .
Parsing [sent. 4860 len. 3]: Old woman .
Parsing [sent. 4861 len. 3]: Face whitey-gray .
Parsing [sent. 4862 len. 3]: Young butcher .
Parsing [sent. 4863 len. 6]: Face a general red flush .
Parsing [sent. 4864 len. 6]: Jaundiced man -- mustard yellow .
Parsing [sent. 4865 len. 3]: Elderly lady .
Parsing [sent. 4866 len. 8]: Colorless skin , with two conspicuous moles .
Parsing [sent. 4867 len. 6]: Elderly man -- a drinker .
Parsing [sent. 4868 len. 11]: Boiled-cauliflower nose in a flabby face veined with purple crinklings .
Parsing [sent. 4869 len. 4]: Healthy young gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 4870 len. 4]: Fine fresh complexion .
Parsing [sent. 4871 len. 4]: Sick young man .
Parsing [sent. 4872 len. 6]: His face a ghastly white .
Parsing [sent. 4873 len. 19]: No end of people whose skins are dull and characterless modifications of the tint which we miscall white .
Parsing [sent. 4874 len. 32]: Some of these faces are pimply ; some exhibit other signs of diseased blood ; some show scars of a tint out of a harmony with the surrounding shades of color .
Parsing [sent. 4875 len. 9]: The white man 's complexion makes no concealments .
Parsing [sent. 4876 len. 4]: It ca n't .
Parsing [sent. 4877 len. 16]: It seemed to have been designed as a catch-all for everything that can damage it .
Parsing [sent. 4878 len. 54]: Ladies have to paint it , and powder it , and cosmetic it , and diet it with arsenic , and enamel it , and be always enticing it , and persuading it , and pestering it , and fussing at it , to make it beautiful ; and they do not succeed .
Parsing [sent. 4879 len. 15]: But these efforts show what they think of the natural complexion , as distributed .
Parsing [sent. 4880 len. 7]: As distributed it needs these helps .
Parsing [sent. 4881 len. 21]: The complexion which they try to counterfeit is one which nature restricts to the few -- to the very few .
Parsing [sent. 4882 len. 16]: To ninety-nine persons she gives a bad complexion , to the hundredth a good one .
Parsing [sent. 4883 len. 9]: The hundredth can keep it -- how long ?
Parsing [sent. 4884 len. 5]: Ten years , perhaps .
Parsing [sent. 4885 len. 10]: The advantage is with the Zulu , I think .
Parsing [sent. 4886 len. 14]: He starts with a beautiful complexion , and it will last him through .
Parsing [sent. 4887 len. 57]: And as for the Indian brown -- firm , smooth , blemishless , pleasant and restful to the eye , afraid of no color , harmonizing with all colors and adding a grace to them all -- I think there is no sort of chance for the average white complexion against that rich and perfect tint .
Parsing [sent. 4888 len. 6]: To return to the bungalow .
Parsing [sent. 4889 len. 11]: The most gorgeous costumes present were worn by some children .
Parsing [sent. 4890 len. 22]: They seemed to blaze , so bright were the colors , and so brilliant the jewels strung over the rich materials .
Parsing [sent. 4891 len. 16]: These children were professional nautch-dancers , and looked like girls , but they were boys .
Parsing [sent. 4892 len. 21]: They got up by ones and twos and fours , and danced and sang to an accompaniment of weird music .
Parsing [sent. 4893 len. 30]: Their posturings and gesturings were elaborate and graceful , but their voices were stringently raspy and unpleasant , and there was a good deal of monotony about the tune .
Parsing [sent. 4894 len. 24]: By and by there was a burst of shouts and cheers outside and the prince with his train entered in fine dramatic style .
Parsing [sent. 4895 len. 44]: He was a stately man , he was ideally costumed , and fairly festooned with ropes of gems ; some of the ropes were of pearls , some were of uncut great emeralds -- emeralds renowned in Bombay for their quality and value .
Parsing [sent. 4896 len. 14]: Their size was marvelous , and enticing to the eye , those rocks .
Parsing [sent. 4897 len. 19]: A boy -- a princeling -- was with the prince , and he also was a radiant exhibition .
Parsing [sent. 4898 len. 6]: The ceremonies were not tedious .
Parsing [sent. 4899 len. 41]: The prince strode to his throne with the port and majesty -- and the sternness -- of a Julius Caesar coming to receive and receipt for a back-country kingdom and have it over and get out , and no fooling .
Parsing [sent. 4900 len. 70]: There was a throne for the young prince , too , and the two sat there , side by side , with their officers grouped at either hand and most accurately and creditably reproducing the pictures which one sees in the books -- pictures which people in the prince 's line of business have been furnishing ever since Solomon received the Queen of Sheba and showed her his things .
Parsing [sent. 4901 len. 47]: The chief of the Jain delegation read his paper of congratulations , then pushed it into a beautifully engraved silver cylinder , which was delivered with ceremony into the prince 's hands and at once delivered by him without ceremony into the hands of an officer .
Parsing [sent. 4902 len. 7]: I will copy the address here .
Parsing [sent. 4903 len. 58]: It is interesting , as showing what an Indian prince 's subject may have opportunity to thank him for in these days of modern English rule , as contrasted with what his ancestor would have given them opportunity to thank him for a century and a half ago -- the days of freedom unhampered by English interference .
Parsing [sent. 4904 len. 18]: A century and a half ago an address of thanks could have been put into small space .
Parsing [sent. 4905 len. 9]: It would have thanked the prince -- 1 .
Parsing [sent. 4906 len. 14]: For not slaughtering too many of his people upon mere caprice ; 2 .
Parsing [sent. 4907 len. 20]: For not stripping them bare by sudden and arbitrary tax levies , and bringing famine upon them ; 3 .
Parsing [sent. 4908 len. 15]: For not upon empty pretext destroying the rich and seizing their property ; 4 .
Parsing [sent. 4909 len. 26]: For not killing , blinding , imprisoning , or banishing the relatives of the royal house to protect the throne from possible plots ; 5 .
Parsing [sent. 4910 len. 32]: For not betraying the subject secretly , for a bribe , into the hands of bands of professional Thugs , to be murdered and robbed in the prince 's back lot .
Parsing [sent. 4911 len. 27]: Those were rather common princely industries in the old times , but they and some others of a harsh sort ceased long ago under English rule .
Parsing [sent. 4912 len. 67]: Better industries have taken their place , as this Address from the Jain community will show : `` Your Highness , -- We the undersigned members of the Jain community of Bombay have the pleasure to approach your Highness with the expression of our heartfelt congratulations on the recent conference on your Highness of the Knighthood of the Most Exalted Order of the Star of India .
Parsing [sent. 4913 len. 71]: Ten years ago we had the pleasure and privilege of welcoming your Highness to this city under circumstances which have made a memorable epoch in the history of your State , for had it not been for a generous and reasonable spirit that your Highness displayed in the negotiations between the Palitana Durbar and the Jain community , the conciliatory spirit that animated our people could not have borne fruit .
Parsing [sent. 4914 len. 28]: That was the first step in your Highness 's administration , and it fitly elicited the praise of the Jain community , and of the Bombay Government .
Parsing [sent. 4915 len. 71]: A decade of your Highness 's administration , combined with the abilities , training , and acquirements that your Highness brought to bear upon it , has justly earned for your Highness the unique and honourable distinction -- the Knighthood of the Most Exalted Order of the Star of India , which we understand your Highness is the first to enjoy among Chiefs of your Highness 's rank and standing .
Parsing [sent. 4916 len. 35]: And we assure your Highness that for this mark of honour that has been conferred on you by Her Most Gracious Majesty , the Queen-Empress , we feel no less proud than your Highness .
Parsing [sent. 4917 len. 64]: Establishment of commercial factories , schools , hospitals , etc. , by your Highness in your State has marked your Highness 's career during these ten years , and we trust that your Highness will be spared to rule over your people with wisdom and foresight , and foster the many reforms that your Highness has been pleased to introduce in your State .
Parsing [sent. 4918 len. 18]: We again offer your Highness our warmest felicitations for the honour that has been conferred on you .
Parsing [sent. 4919 len. 11]: We beg to remain your Highness 's obedient servants . ''
Parsing [sent. 4920 len. 8]: Factories , schools , hospitals , reforms .
Parsing [sent. 4921 len. 20]: The prince propagates that kind of things in the modern times , and gets knighthood and guns for it .
Parsing [sent. 4922 len. 46]: After the address the prince responded with snap and brevity ; spoke a moment with half a dozen guests in English , and with an official or two in a native tongue ; then the garlands were distributed as usual , and the function ended .
Parsing [sent. 4923 len. 3]: CHAPTER XLII .
Parsing [sent. 4924 len. 17]: Each person is born to one possession which outvalues all his others -- his last breath .
Parsing [sent. 4925 len. 9]: -- Pudd ` nhead Wilson 's New Calendar .
Parsing [sent. 4926 len. 11]: Toward midnight , that night , there was another function .
Parsing [sent. 4927 len. 16]: This was a Hindoo wedding -- no , I think it was a betrothal ceremony .
Parsing [sent. 4928 len. 26]: Always before , we had driven through streets that were multitudinous and tumultuous with picturesque native life , but now there was nothing of that .
Parsing [sent. 4929 len. 11]: We seemed to move through a city of the dead .
Parsing [sent. 4930 len. 14]: There was hardly a suggestion of life in those still and vacant streets .
Parsing [sent. 4931 len. 6]: Even the crows were silent .
Parsing [sent. 4932 len. 11]: But everywhere on the ground lay sleeping natives-hundreds and hundreds .
Parsing [sent. 4933 len. 16]: They lay stretched at full length and tightly wrapped in blankets , heads and all .
Parsing [sent. 4934 len. 8]: Their attitude and their rigidity counterfeited death .
Parsing [sent. 4935 len. 16]: The plague was not in Bombay then , but it is devastating the city now .
Parsing [sent. 4936 len. 26]: The shops are deserted , now , half of the people have fled , and of the remainder the smitten perish by shoals every day .
Parsing [sent. 4937 len. 16]: No doubt the city looks now in the daytime as it looked then at night .
Parsing [sent. 4938 len. 40]: When we had pierced deep into the native quarter and were threading its narrow dim lanes , we had to go carefully , for men were stretched asleep all about and there was hardly room to drive between them .
Parsing [sent. 4939 len. 40]: And every now and then a swarm of rats would scamper across past the horses ' feet in the vague light -- the forbears of the rats that are carrying the plague from house to house in Bombay now .
Parsing [sent. 4940 len. 35]: The shops were but sheds , little booths open to the street ; and the goods had been removed , and on the counters families were sleeping , usually with an oil lamp present .
Parsing [sent. 4941 len. 8]: Recurrent dead watches , it looked like .
Parsing [sent. 4942 len. 16]: But at last we turned a corner and saw a great glare of light ahead .
Parsing [sent. 4943 len. 28]: It was the home of the bride , wrapped in a perfect conflagration of illuminations , -- mainly gas-work designs , gotten up specially for the occasion .
Parsing [sent. 4944 len. 22]: Within was abundance of brilliancy -- flames , costumes , colors , decorations , mirrors -- it was another Aladdin show .
Parsing [sent. 4945 len. 33]: The bride was a trim and comely little thing of twelve years , dressed as we would dress a boy , though more expensively than we should do it , of course .
Parsing [sent. 4946 len. 25]: She moved about very much at her ease , and stopped and talked with the guests and allowed her wedding jewelry to be examined .
Parsing [sent. 4947 len. 5]: It was very fine .
Parsing [sent. 4948 len. 16]: Particularly a rope of great diamonds , a lovely thing to look at and handle .
Parsing [sent. 4949 len. 9]: It had a great emerald hanging to it .
Parsing [sent. 4950 len. 6]: The bridegroom was not present .
Parsing [sent. 4951 len. 14]: He was having betrothal festivities of his own at his father 's house .
Parsing [sent. 4952 len. 32]: As I understood it , he and the bride were to entertain company every night and nearly all night for a week or more , then get married , if alive .
Parsing [sent. 4953 len. 42]: Both of the children were a little elderly , as brides and grooms go , in India -- twelve ; they ought to have been married a year or two sooner ; still to a stranger twelve seems quite young enough .
Parsing [sent. 4954 len. 22]: A while after midnight a couple of celebrated and high-priced nautch-girls appeared in the gorgeous place , and danced and sang .
Parsing [sent. 4955 len. 23]: With them were men who played upon strange instruments which made uncanny noises of a sort to make one 's flesh creep .
Parsing [sent. 4956 len. 23]: One of these instruments was a pipe , and to its music the girls went through a performance which represented snake charming .
Parsing [sent. 4957 len. 41]: It seemed a doubtful sort of music to charm anything with , but a native gentleman assured me that snakes like it and will come out of their holes and listen to it with every evidence of refreshment and gratitude .
Parsing [sent. 4958 len. 35]: He said that at an entertainment in his grounds once , the pipe brought out half a dozen snakes , and the music had to be stopped before they would be persuaded to go .
Parsing [sent. 4959 len. 40]: Nobody wanted their company , for they were bold , familiar , and dangerous ; but no one would kill them , of course , for it is sinful for a Hindoo to kill any kind of a creature .
Parsing [sent. 4960 len. 11]: We withdrew from the festivities at two in the morning .
Parsing [sent. 4961 len. 22]: Another picture , then -- but it has lodged itself in my memory rather as a stage-scene than as a reality .
Parsing [sent. 4962 len. 67]: It is of a porch and short flight of steps crowded with dark faces and ghostly-white draperies flooded with the strong glare from the dazzling concentration of illuminations ; and midway of the steps one conspicuous figure for accent -- a turbaned giant , with a name according to his size : Rao Bahadur Baskirao Balinkanje Pitale , Vakeel to his Highness the Gaikwar of Baroda .
Parsing [sent. 4963 len. 25]: Without him the picture would not have been complete ; and if his name had been merely Smith , he would n't have answered .
Parsing [sent. 4964 len. 54]: Close at hand on house-fronts on both sides of the narrow street were illuminations of a kind commonly employed by the natives -- scores of glass tumblers -LRB- containing tapers -RRB- fastened a few inches apart all over great latticed frames , forming starry constellations which showed out vividly against their black backgrounds .
Parsing [sent. 4965 len. 31]: As we drew away into the distance down the dim lanes the illuminations gathered together into a single mass , and glowed out of the enveloping darkness like a sun .
Parsing [sent. 4966 len. 43]: Then again the deep silence , the skurrying rats , the dim forms stretched everywhere on the ground ; and on either hand those open booths counterfeiting sepulchres , with counterfeit corpses sleeping motionless in the flicker of the counterfeit death lamps .
Parsing [sent. 4967 len. 38]: And now , a year later , when I read the cablegrams I seem to be reading of what I myself partly saw -- saw before it happened -- in a prophetic dream , as it were .
Parsing [sent. 4968 len. 14]: One cablegram says , `` Business in the native town is about suspended .
Parsing [sent. 4969 len. 10]: Except the wailing and the tramp of the funerals .
Parsing [sent. 4970 len. 8]: There is but little life or movement .
Parsing [sent. 4971 len. 12]: The closed shops exceed in number those that remain open . ''
Parsing [sent. 4972 len. 20]: Another says that 325,000 of the people have fled the city and are carrying the plague to the country .
Parsing [sent. 4973 len. 16]: Three days later comes the news , `` The population is reduced by half . ''
Parsing [sent. 4974 len. 17]: The refugees have carried the disease to Karachi ; `` 220 cases , 214 deaths . ''
Parsing [sent. 4975 len. 18]: A day or two later , `` 52 fresh cases , all of which proved fatal . ''
Parsing [sent. 4976 len. 31]: The plague carries with it a terror which no other disease can excite ; for of all diseases known to men it is the deadliest -- by far the deadliest .
Parsing [sent. 4977 len. 9]: `` Fifty-two fresh cases -- all fatal . ''
Parsing [sent. 4978 len. 11]: It is the Black Death alone that slays like that .
Parsing [sent. 4979 len. 78]: We can all imagine , after a fashion , the desolation of a plague-stricken city , and the stupor of stillness broken at intervals by distant bursts of wailing , marking the passing of funerals , here and there and yonder , but I suppose it is not possible for us to realize to ourselves the nightmare of dread and fear that possesses the living who are present in such a place and can not get away .
Parsing [sent. 4980 len. 48]: That half million fled from Bombay in a wild panic suggests to us something of what they were feeling , but perhaps not even they could realize what the half million were feeling whom they left stranded behind to face the stalking horror without chance of escape .
Parsing [sent. 4981 len. 135]: Kinglake was in Cairo many years ago during an epidemic of the Black Death , and he has imagined the terrors that creep into a man 's heart at such a time and follow him until they themselves breed the fatal sign in the armpit , and then the delirium with confused images , and home-dreams , and reeling billiard-tables , and then the sudden blank of death : `` To the contagionist , filled as he is with the dread of final causes , having no faith in destiny , nor in the fixed will of God , and with none of the devil-may-care indifference which might stand him instead of creeds -- to such one , every rag that shivers in the breeze of a plague-stricken city has this sort of sublimity .
Parsing [sent. 4982 len. 62]: If by any terrible ordinance he be forced to venture forth , he sees death dangling from every sleeve ; and , as he creeps forward , he poises his shuddering limbs between the imminent jacket that is stabbing at his right elbow and the murderous pelisse that threatens to mow him clean down as it sweeps along on his left .
Parsing [sent. 4983 len. 55]: But most of all he dreads that which most of all he should love -- the touch of a woman 's dress ; for mothers and wives , hurrying forth on kindly errands from the bedsides of the dying , go slouching along through the streets more willfully and less courteously than the men .
Parsing [sent. 4984 len. 71]: For a while it may be that the caution of the poor Levantine may enable him to avoid contact , but sooner or later , perhaps , the dreaded chance arrives ; that bundle of linen , with the dark tearful eyes at the top of it , that labors along with the voluptuous clumsiness of Grisi -- she has touched the poor Levantine with the hem of her sleeve !
Parsing [sent. 4985 len. 44]: From that dread moment his peace is gone ; his mind for ever hanging upon the fatal touch invites the blow which he fears ; he watches for the symptoms of plague so carefully , that sooner or later they come in truth .
Parsing [sent. 4986 len. 64]: The parched mouth is a sign -- his mouth is parched ; the throbbing brain -- his brain does throb ; the rapid pulse -- he touches his own wrist -LRB- for he dares not ask counsel of any man lest he be deserted -RRB- , he touches his wrist , and feels how his frighted blood goes galloping out of his heart .
Parsing [sent. 4987 len. 64]: There is nothing but the fatal swelling that is wanting to make his sad conviction complete ; immediately , he has an odd feel under the arm -- no pain , but a little straining of the skin ; he would to God it were his fancy that were strong enough to give him that sensation ; this is the worst of all .
Parsing [sent. 4988 len. 47]: It now seems to him that he could be happy and contented with his parched mouth , and his throbbing brain , and his rapid pulse , if only he could know that there were no swelling under the left arm ; but dares he try ?
Parsing [sent. 4989 len. 72]: -- in a moment of calmness and deliberation he dares not ; but when for a while he has writhed under the torture of suspense , a sudden strength of will drives him to seek and know his fate ; he touches the gland , and finds the skin sane and sound but under the cuticle there lies a small lump like a pistol-bullet , that moves as he pushes it .
Parsing [sent. 4990 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 4991 len. 14]: but is this for all certainty , is this the sentence of death ?
Parsing [sent. 4992 len. 8]: Feel the gland of the other arm .
Parsing [sent. 4993 len. 15]: There is not the same lump exactly , yet something a little like it .
Parsing [sent. 4994 len. 8]: Have not some people glands naturally enlarged ?
Parsing [sent. 4995 len. 8]: -- would to heaven he were one !
Parsing [sent. 4996 len. 77]: So he does for himself the work of the plague , and when the Angel of Death thus courted does indeed and in truth come , he has only to finish that which has been so well begun ; he passes his fiery hand over the brain of the victim , and lets him rave for a season , but all chance-wise , of people and things once dear , or of people and things indifferent .
Parsing [sent. 4997 len. 202]: Once more the poor fellow is back at his home in fair Provence , and sees the sundial that stood in his childhood 's garden -- sees his mother , and the long-since forgotten face of that little dear sister -- -LRB- he sees her , he says , on a Sunday morning , for all the church bells are ringing -RRB- ; he looks up and down through the universe , and owns it well piled with bales upon bales of cotton , and cotton eternal -- so much so that he feels -- he knows -- he swears he could make that winning hazard , if the billiard-table would not slant upwards , and if the cue were a cue worth playing with ; but it is not -- it 's a cue that wo n't move -- his own arm wo n't move -- in short , there 's the devil to pay in the brain of the poor Levantine ; and perhaps , the next night but one he becomes the ` life and the soul ' of some squalling jackal family , who fish him out by the foot from his shallow and sandy grave . ''
Parsing [sent. 4998 len. 3]: CHAPTER XLIII .
Parsing [sent. 4999 len. 15]: Hunger is the handmaid of genius -- Pudd ` nhead Wilson 's New Calendar .
Parsing [sent. 5000 len. 63]: One day during our stay in Bombay there was a criminal trial of a most interesting sort , a terribly realistic chapter out of the `` Arabian Nights , '' a strange mixture of simplicities and pieties and murderous practicalities , which brought back the forgotten days of Thuggee and made them live again ; in fact , even made them believable .
Parsing [sent. 5001 len. 31]: It was a case where a young girl had been assassinated for the sake of her trifling ornaments , things not worth a laborer 's day 's wages in America .
Parsing [sent. 5002 len. 43]: This thing could have been done in many other countries , but hardly with the cold business-like depravity , absence of fear , absence of caution , destitution of the sense of horror , repentance , remorse , exhibited in this case .
Parsing [sent. 5003 len. 59]: Elsewhere the murderer would have done his crime secretly , by night , and without witnesses ; his fears would have allowed him no peace while the dead body was in his neighborhood ; he would not have rested until he had gotten it safe out of the way and hidden as effectually as he could hide it .
Parsing [sent. 5004 len. 85]: But this Indian murderer does his deed in the full light of day , cares nothing for the society of witnesses , is in no way incommoded by the presence of the corpse , takes his own time about disposing of it , and the whole party are so indifferent , so phlegmatic , that they take their regular sleep as if nothing was happening and no halters hanging over them ; and these five bland people close the episode with a religious service .
Parsing [sent. 5005 len. 125]: The thing reads like a Meadows-Taylor Thug-tale of half a century ago , as may be seen by the official report of the trial : `` At the Mazagon Police Court yesterday , Superintendent Nolan again charged Tookaram Suntoo Savat Baya , woman , her daughter Krishni , and Gopal Vithoo Bhanayker , before Mr. Phiroze Hoshang Dastur , Fourth Presidency Magistrate , under sections 302 and 109 of the Code , with having on the night of the 30th of December last murdered a Hindoo girl named Cassi , aged 12 , by strangulation , in the room of a chawl at Jakaria Bunder , on the Sewriroad , and also with aiding and abetting each other in the commission of the offense .
Parsing [sent. 5006 len. 23]: `` Mr. F. A. Little , Public Prosecutor , conducted the case on behalf of the Crown , the accused being undefended .
Parsing [sent. 5007 len. 49]: `` Mr. Little applied under the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code to tender pardon to one of the accused , Krishni , woman , aged 22 , on her undertaking to make a true and full statement of facts under which the deceased girl Cassi was murdered .
Parsing [sent. 5008 len. 44]: `` The Magistrate having granted the Public Prosecutor 's application , the accused Krishni went into the witness-box , and , on being examined by Mr. Little , made the following confession : -- I am a mill-hand employed at the Jubilee Mill .
Parsing [sent. 5009 len. 19]: I recollect the day -LRB- Tuesday -RRB- ; on which the body of the deceased Cassi was found .
Parsing [sent. 5010 len. 65]: Previous to that I attended the mill for half a day , and then returned home at 3 in the afternoon , when I saw five persons in the house , viz. : the first accused Tookaram , who is my paramour , my mother , the second accused Baya , the accused Gopal , and two guests named Ramji Daji and Annaji Gungaram .
Parsing [sent. 5011 len. 39]: Tookaram rented the room of the chawl situated at Jakaria Bunder-road from its owner , Girdharilal Radhakishan , and in that room I , my paramour , Tookaram , and his younger brother , Yesso Mahadhoo , live .
Parsing [sent. 5012 len. 16]: Since his arrival in Bombay from his native country Yesso came and lived with us .
Parsing [sent. 5013 len. 54]: When I returned from the mill on the afternoon of that day , I saw the two guests seated on a cot in the veranda , and a few minutes after the accused Gopal came and took his seat by their side , while I and my mother were seated inside the room .
Parsing [sent. 5014 len. 27]: Tookaram , who had gone out to fetch some ` pan ' and betelnuts , on his return home had brought the two guests with him .
Parsing [sent. 5015 len. 11]: After returning home he gave them ` pan supari ' .
Parsing [sent. 5016 len. 47]: While they were eating it my mother came out of the room and inquired of one of the guests , Ramji , what had happened to his foot , when he replied that he had tried many remedies , but they had done him no good .
Parsing [sent. 5017 len. 31]: My mother then took some rice in her hand and prophesied that the disease which Ramji was suffering from would not be cured until he returned to his native country .
Parsing [sent. 5018 len. 33]: In the meantime the deceased Casi came from the direction of an out-house , and stood in front on the threshold of our room with a ` lota ' in her hand .
Parsing [sent. 5019 len. 22]: Tookaram then told his two guests to leave the room , and they then went up the steps towards the quarry .
Parsing [sent. 5020 len. 39]: After the guests had gone away , Tookaram seized the deceased , who had come into the room , and he afterwards put a waistband around her , and tied her to a post which supports a loft .
Parsing [sent. 5021 len. 35]: After doing this , he pressed the girl 's throat , and , having tied her mouth with the ` dhotur ' -LRB- now shown in Court -RRB- , fastened it to the post .
Parsing [sent. 5022 len. 28]: Having killed the girl , Tookaram removed her gold head ornament and a gold ` putlee ' , and also took charge of her ` lota ' .
Parsing [sent. 5023 len. 29]: Besides these two ornaments Cassi had on her person ear-studs , a nose-ring , some silver toe-rings , two necklaces , a pair of silver anklets and bracelets .
Parsing [sent. 5024 len. 23]: Tookaram afterwards tried to remove the silver amulets , the ear-studs , and the nose-ring ; but he failed in his attempt .
Parsing [sent. 5025 len. 16]: While he was doing so , I , my mother , and Gopal were present .
Parsing [sent. 5026 len. 23]: After removing the two gold ornaments , he handed them over to Gopal , who was at the time standing near me .
Parsing [sent. 5027 len. 19]: When he killed Cassi , Tookaram threatened to strangle me also if I informed any one of this .
Parsing [sent. 5028 len. 21]: Gopal and myself were then standing at the door of our room , and we both were threatened by Tookaram .
Parsing [sent. 5029 len. 29]: My mother , Baya , had seized the legs of the deceased at the time she was killed , and whilst she was being tied to the post .
Parsing [sent. 5030 len. 6]: Cassi then made a noise .
Parsing [sent. 5031 len. 11]: Tookaram and my mother took part in killing the girl .
Parsing [sent. 5032 len. 23]: After the murder her body was wrapped up in a mattress and kept on the loft over the door of our room .
Parsing [sent. 5033 len. 18]: When Cassi was strangled , the door of the room was fastened from the inside by Tookaram .
Parsing [sent. 5034 len. 15]: This deed was committed shortly after my return home from work in the mill .
Parsing [sent. 5035 len. 44]: Tookaram put the body of the deceased in the mattress , and , after it was left on the loft , he went to have his head shaved by a barber named Sambhoo Raghoo , who lives only one door away from me .
Parsing [sent. 5036 len. 13]: My mother and myself then remained in the possession of the information .
Parsing [sent. 5037 len. 28]: I was slapped and threatened by my paramour , Tookaram , and that was the only reason why I did not inform any one at that time .
Parsing [sent. 5038 len. 17]: When I told Tookaram that I would give information of the occurrence , he slapped me .
Parsing [sent. 5039 len. 33]: The accused Gopal was asked by Tookaram to go back to his room , and he did so , taking away with him the two gold ornaments and the ` lota ' .
Parsing [sent. 5040 len. 26]: Yesso Mahadhoo , a brother-in-law of Tookaram , came to the house and asked Tookaram why he was washing , the water-pipe being just opposite .
Parsing [sent. 5041 len. 16]: Tookaram replied that he was washing his dhotur , as a fowl had polluted it .
Parsing [sent. 5042 len. 42]: About 6 o'clock of the evening of that day my mother gave me three pice and asked me to buy a cocoanut , and I gave the money to Yessoo , who went and fetched a cocoanut and some betel leaves .
Parsing [sent. 5043 len. 40]: When Yessoo and others were in the room I was bathing , and , after I finished my bath , my mother took the cocoanut and the betel leaves from Yessoo , and we five went to the sea .
Parsing [sent. 5044 len. 19]: The party consisted of Tookaram , my mother , Yessoo , Tookaram 's younger brother , and myself .
Parsing [sent. 5045 len. 25]: On reaching the seashore , my mother made the offering to the sea , and prayed to be pardoned for what we had done .
Parsing [sent. 5046 len. 17]: Before we went to the sea , some one came to inquire after the girl Cassi .
Parsing [sent. 5047 len. 22]: The police and other people came to make these inquiries both before and after we left the house for the seashore .
Parsing [sent. 5048 len. 24]: The police questioned my mother about the girl , and she replied that Cassi had come to her door , but had left .
Parsing [sent. 5049 len. 18]: The next day the police questioned Tookaram , and he , too , gave a similar reply .
Parsing [sent. 5050 len. 15]: This was said the same night when the search was made for the girl .
Parsing [sent. 5051 len. 37]: After the offering was made to the sea , we partook of the cocoanut and returned home , when my mother gave me some food ; but Tookaram did not partake of any food that night .
Parsing [sent. 5052 len. 29]: After dinner I and my mother slept inside the room , and Tookaram slept on a cot near his brother-in-law , Yessoo Mahadhoo , just outside the door .
Parsing [sent. 5053 len. 10]: That was not the usual place where Tookaram slept .
Parsing [sent. 5054 len. 7]: He usually slept inside the room .
Parsing [sent. 5055 len. 15]: The body of the deceased remained on the loft when I went to sleep .
Parsing [sent. 5056 len. 22]: The room in which we slept was locked , and I heard that my paramour , Tookaram , was restless outside .
Parsing [sent. 5057 len. 21]: About 3 o'clock the following morning Tookaram knocked at the door , when both myself and my mother opened it .
Parsing [sent. 5058 len. 22]: He then told me to go to the steps leading to the quarry , and see if any one was about .
Parsing [sent. 5059 len. 21]: Those steps lead to a stable , through which we go to the quarry at the back of the compound .
Parsing [sent. 5060 len. 12]: When I got to the steps I saw no one there .
Parsing [sent. 5061 len. 20]: Tookaram asked me if any one was there , and I replied that I could see no one about .
Parsing [sent. 5062 len. 38]: He then took the body of the deceased from the loft , and having wrapped it up in his saree , asked me to accompany him to the steps of the quarry , and I did so .
Parsing [sent. 5063 len. 11]: The ` saree ' now produced here was the same .
Parsing [sent. 5064 len. 17]: Besides the ` saree ' , there was also a ` cholee ' on the body .
Parsing [sent. 5065 len. 40]: He then carried the body in his arms , and went up the steps , through the stable , and then to the right hand towards a Sahib 's bungalow , where Tookaram placed the body near a wall .
Parsing [sent. 5066 len. 11]: All the time I and my mother were with him .
Parsing [sent. 5067 len. 14]: When the body was taken down , Yessoo was lying on the cot .
Parsing [sent. 5068 len. 27]: After depositing the body under the wall , we all returned home , and soon after 5 a.m. the police again came and took Tookaram away .
Parsing [sent. 5069 len. 14]: About an hour after they returned and took me and my mother away .
Parsing [sent. 5070 len. 12]: We were questioned about it , when I made a statement .
Parsing [sent. 5071 len. 47]: Two hours later I was taken to the room , and I pointed out this waistband , the ` dhotur ' , the mattress , and the wooden post to Superintendent Nolan and Inspectors Roberts and Rashanali , in the presence of my mother and Tookaram .
Parsing [sent. 5072 len. 25]: Tookaram killed the girl Cassi for her ornaments , which he wanted for the girl to whom he was shortly going to be married .
Parsing [sent. 5073 len. 16]: The body was found in the same place where it was deposited by Tookaram . ''
Parsing [sent. 5074 len. 14]: The criminal side of the native has always been picturesque , always readable .
Parsing [sent. 5075 len. 32]: The Thuggee and one or two other particularly outrageous features of it have been suppressed by the English , but there is enough of it left to keep it darkly interesting .
Parsing [sent. 5076 len. 10]: One finds evidence of these survivals in the newspapers .
Parsing [sent. 5077 len. 60]: Macaulay has a light-throwing passage upon this matter in his great historical sketch of Warren Hastings , where he is describing some effects which followed the temporary paralysis of Hastings ' powerful government brought about by Sir Philip Francis and his party : `` The natives considered Hastings as a fallen man ; and they acted after their kind .
Parsing [sent. 5078 len. 44]: Some of our readers may have seen , in India , a cloud of crows pecking a sick vulture to death -- no bad type of what happens in that country as often as fortune deserts one who has been great and dreaded .
Parsing [sent. 5079 len. 45]: In an instant all the sycophants , who had lately been ready to lie for him , to forge for him , to pander for him , to poison for him , hasten to purchase the favor of his victorious enemies by accusing him .
Parsing [sent. 5080 len. 52]: An Indian government has only to let it be understood that it wishes a particular man to be ruined , and in twenty-four hours it will be furnished with grave charges , supported by depositions so full and circumstantial that any person unaccustomed to Asiatic mendacity would regard them as decisive .
Parsing [sent. 5081 len. 37]: It is well if the signature of the destined victim is not counterfeited at the foot of some illegal compact , and if some treasonable paper is not slipped into a hiding-place in his house . ''
Parsing [sent. 5082 len. 10]: That was nearly a century and a quarter ago .
Parsing [sent. 5083 len. 31]: An article in one of the chief journals of India -LRB- the Pioneer -RRB- shows that in some respects the native of to-day is just what his ancestor was then .
Parsing [sent. 5084 len. 84]: Here are niceties of so subtle and delicate a sort that they lift their breed of rascality to a place among the fine arts , and almost entitle it to respect : `` The records of the Indian courts might certainly be relied upon to prove that swindlers as a class in the East come very close to , if they do not surpass , in brilliancy of execution and originality of design the most expert of their fraternity in Europe and America .
Parsing [sent. 5085 len. 9]: India in especial is the home of forgery .
Parsing [sent. 5086 len. 20]: There are some particular districts which are noted as marts for the finest specimens of the forger 's handiwork .
Parsing [sent. 5087 len. 18]: The business is carried on by firms who possess stores of stamped papers to suit every emergency .
Parsing [sent. 5088 len. 43]: They habitually lay in a store of fresh stamped papers every year , and some of the older and more thriving houses can supply documents for the past forty years , bearing the proper water-mark and possessing the genuine appearance of age .
Parsing [sent. 5089 len. 54]: Other districts have earned notoriety for skilled perjury , a pre-eminence that excites a respectful admiration when one thinks of the universal prevalence of the art , and persons desirous of succeeding in false suits are ready to pay handsomely to avail themselves of the services of these local experts as witnesses . ''
Parsing [sent. 5090 len. 12]: Various instances illustrative of the methods of these swindlers are given .
Parsing [sent. 5091 len. 50]: They exhibit deep cunning and total depravity on the part of the swindler and his pals , and more obtuseness on the part of the victim than one would expect to find in a country where suspicion of your neighbor must surely be one of the earliest things learned .
Parsing [sent. 5092 len. 29]: The favorite subject is the young fool who has just come into a fortune and is trying to see how poor a use he can put it to .
Parsing [sent. 5093 len. 21]: I will quote one example : `` Sometimes another form of confidence trick is adopted , which is invariably successful .
Parsing [sent. 5094 len. 23]: The particular pigeon is spotted , and , his acquaintance having been made , he is encouraged in every form of vice .
Parsing [sent. 5095 len. 29]: When the friendship is thoroughly established , the swindler remarks to the young man that he has a brother who has asked him to lend him Rs .10,000 .
Parsing [sent. 5096 len. 27]: The swindler says he has the money and would lend it ; but , as the borrower is his brother , he can not charge interest .
Parsing [sent. 5097 len. 44]: So he proposes that he should hand the dupe the money , and the latter should lend it to the swindler 's brother , exacting a heavy pre-payment of interest which , it is pointed out , they may equally enjoy in dissipation .
Parsing [sent. 5098 len. 26]: The dupe sees no objection , and on the appointed day receives Rs .7,000 from the swindler , which he hands over to the confederate .
Parsing [sent. 5099 len. 21]: The latter is profuse in his thanks , and executes a promissory note for Rs .10,000 , payable to bearer .
Parsing [sent. 5100 len. 47]: The swindler allows the scheme to remain quiescent for a time , and then suggests that , as the money has not been repaid and as it would be unpleasant to sue his brother , it would be better to sell the note in the bazaar .
Parsing [sent. 5101 len. 47]: The dupe hands the note over , for the money he advanced was not his , and , on being informed that it would be necessary to have his signature on the back so as to render the security negotiable , he signs without any hesitation .
Parsing [sent. 5102 len. 27]: The swindler passes it on to confederates , and the latter employ a respectable firm of solicitors to ask the dupe if his signature is genuine .
Parsing [sent. 5103 len. 12]: He admits it at once , and his fate is sealed .
Parsing [sent. 5104 len. 17]: A suit is filed by a confederate against the dupe , two accomplices being made co-defendants .
Parsing [sent. 5105 len. 21]: They admit their Signatures as indorsers , and the one swears he bought the note for value from the dupe .
Parsing [sent. 5106 len. 28]: The latter has no defense , for no court would believe the apparently idle explanation of the manner in which he came to endorse the note . ''
Parsing [sent. 5107 len. 6]: There is only one India !
Parsing [sent. 5108 len. 15]: It is the only country that has a monopoly of grand and imposing specialties .
Parsing [sent. 5109 len. 24]: When another country has a remarkable thing , it can not have it all to itself -- some other country has a duplicate .
Parsing [sent. 5110 len. 7]: But India -- that is different .
Parsing [sent. 5111 len. 18]: Its marvels are its own ; the patents can not be infringed ; imitations are not possible .
Parsing [sent. 5112 len. 24]: And think of the size of them , the majesty of them , the weird and outlandish character of the most of them !
Parsing [sent. 5113 len. 22]: There is the Plague , the Black Death : India invented it ; India is the cradle of that mighty birth .
Parsing [sent. 5114 len. 9]: The Car of Juggernaut was India 's invention .
Parsing [sent. 5115 len. 41]: So was the Suttee ; and within the time of men still living eight hundred widows willingly , and , in fact , rejoicingly , burned themselves to death on the bodies of their dead husbands in a single year .
Parsing [sent. 5116 len. 15]: Eight hundred would do it this year if the British government would let them .
Parsing [sent. 5117 len. 6]: Famine is India 's specialty .
Parsing [sent. 5118 len. 26]: Elsewhere famines are inconsequential incidents -- in India they are devastating cataclysms ; in one case they annihilate hundreds ; in the other , millions .
Parsing [sent. 5119 len. 10]: India has 2,000,000 gods , and worships them all .
Parsing [sent. 5120 len. 14]: In religion all other countries are paupers ; India is the only millionaire .
Parsing [sent. 5121 len. 24]: With her everything is on a giant scale -- even her poverty ; no other country can show anything to compare with it .
Parsing [sent. 5122 len. 26]: And she has been used to wealth on so vast a scale that she has to shorten to single words the expressions describing great sums .
Parsing [sent. 5123 len. 25]: She describes 100,000 with one word -- a ` lahk ' ; she describes ten millions with one word -- a ` crore ' .
Parsing [sent. 5124 len. 40]: In the bowels of the granite mountains she has patiently carved out dozens of vast temples , and made them glorious with sculptured colonnades and stately groups of statuary , and has adorned the eternal walls with noble paintings .
Parsing [sent. 5125 len. 55]: She has built fortresses of such magnitude that the show-strongholds of the rest of the world are but modest little things by comparison ; palaces that are wonders for rarity of materials , delicacy and beauty of workmanship , and for cost ; and one tomb which men go around the globe to see .
Parsing [sent. 5126 len. 20]: It takes eighty nations , speaking eighty languages , to people her , and they number three hundred millions .
Parsing [sent. 5127 len. 33]: On top of all this she is the mother and home of that wonder of wonders -- caste -- and of that mystery of mysteries , the satanic brotherhood of the Thugs .
Parsing [sent. 5128 len. 14]: India had the start of the whole world in the beginning of things .
Parsing [sent. 5129 len. 37]: She had the first civilization ; she had the first accumulation of material wealth ; she was populous with deep thinkers and subtle intellects ; she had mines , and woods , and a fruitful soil .
Parsing [sent. 5130 len. 44]: It would seem as if she should have kept the lead , and should be to-day not the meek dependent of an alien master , but mistress of the world , and delivering law and command to every tribe and nation in it .
Parsing [sent. 5131 len. 16]: But , in truth , there was never any possibility of such supremacy for her .
Parsing [sent. 5132 len. 18]: If there had been but one India and one language -- but there were eighty of them !
Parsing [sent. 5133 len. 41]: Where there are eighty nations and several hundred governments , fighting and quarreling must be the common business of life ; unity of purpose and policy are impossible ; out of such elements supremacy in the world can not come .
Parsing [sent. 5134 len. 61]: Even caste itself could have had the defeating effect of a multiplicity of tongues , no doubt ; for it separates a people into layers , and layers , and still other layers , that have no community of feeling with each other ; and in such a condition of things as that , patriotism can have no healthy growth .
Parsing [sent. 5135 len. 20]: It was the division of the country into so many States and nations that made Thuggee possible and prosperous .
Parsing [sent. 5136 len. 8]: It is difficult to realize the situation .
Parsing [sent. 5137 len. 72]: But perhaps one may approximate it by imagining the States of our Union peopled by separate nations , speaking separate languages , with guards and custom-houses strung along all frontiers , plenty of interruptions for travelers and traders , interpreters able to handle all the languages very rare or non-existent , and a few wars always going on here and there and yonder as a further embarrassment to commerce and excursioning .
Parsing [sent. 5138 len. 9]: It would make intercommunication in a measure ungeneral .
Parsing [sent. 5139 len. 11]: India had eighty languages , and more custom-houses than cats .
Parsing [sent. 5140 len. 23]: No clever man with the instinct of a highway robber could fail to notice what a chance for business was here offered .
Parsing [sent. 5141 len. 31]: India was full of clever men with the highwayman instinct , and so , quite naturally , the brotherhood of the Thugs came into being to meet the long-felt want .
Parsing [sent. 5142 len. 14]: How long ago that was nobody knows -- centuries , it is supposed .
Parsing [sent. 5143 len. 18]: One of the chiefest wonders connected with it was the success with which it kept its secret .
Parsing [sent. 5144 len. 36]: The English trader did business in India two hundred years and more before he ever heard of it ; and yet it was assassinating its thousands all around him every year , the whole time .
Parsing [sent. 5145 len. 3]: CHAPTER XLIV .
Parsing [sent. 5146 len. 13]: The old saw says , `` Let a sleeping dog lie . ''
Parsing [sent. 5147 len. 21]: Right ... Still , when there is much at stake it is better to get a newspaper to do it .
Parsing [sent. 5148 len. 9]: -- Pudd ` nhead Wilson 's New Calendar .
Parsing [sent. 5149 len. 6]: FROM DIARY : January 28 .
Parsing [sent. 5150 len. 10]: I learned of an official Thug-book the other day .
Parsing [sent. 5151 len. 12]: I was not aware before that there was such a thing .
Parsing [sent. 5152 len. 9]: I am allowed the temporary use of it .
Parsing [sent. 5153 len. 7]: We are making preparations for travel .
Parsing [sent. 5154 len. 8]: Mainly the preparations are purchases of bedding .
Parsing [sent. 5155 len. 24]: This is to be used in sleeping berths in the trains ; in private houses sometimes ; and in nine-tenths of the hotels .
Parsing [sent. 5156 len. 11]: It is not realizable ; and yet it is true .
Parsing [sent. 5157 len. 24]: It is a survival ; an apparently unnecessary thing which in some strange way has outlived the conditions which once made it necessary .
Parsing [sent. 5158 len. 52]: It comes down from a time when the railway and the hotel did not exist ; when the occasional white traveler went horseback or by bullock-cart , and stopped over night in the small dak-bungalow provided at easy distances by the government -- a shelter , merely , and nothing more .
Parsing [sent. 5159 len. 11]: He had to carry bedding along , or do without .
Parsing [sent. 5160 len. 45]: The dwellings of the English residents are spacious and comfortable and commodiously furnished , and surely it must be an odd sight to see half a dozen guests come filing into such a place and dumping blankets and pillows here and there and everywhere .
Parsing [sent. 5161 len. 7]: But custom makes incongruous things congruous .
Parsing [sent. 5162 len. 22]: One buys the bedding , with waterproof hold-all for it at almost any shop -- there is no difficulty about it .
Parsing [sent. 5163 len. 3]: January 30 .
Parsing [sent. 5164 len. 11]: What a spectacle the railway station was , at train-time !
Parsing [sent. 5165 len. 60]: It was a very large station , yet when we arrived it seemed as if the whole world was present -- half of it inside , the other half outside , and both halves , bearing mountainous head-loads of bedding and other freight , trying simultaneously to pass each other , in opposing floods , in one narrow door .
Parsing [sent. 5166 len. 69]: These opposing floods were patient , gentle , long-suffering natives , with whites scattered among them at rare intervals ; and wherever a white man 's native servant appeared , that native seemed to have put aside his natural gentleness for the time and invested himself with the white man 's privilege of making a way for himself by promptly shoving all intervening black things out of it .
Parsing [sent. 5167 len. 9]: In these exhibitions of authority Satan was scandalous .
Parsing [sent. 5168 len. 12]: He was probably a Thug in one of his former incarnations .
Parsing [sent. 5169 len. 65]: Inside the great station , tides upon tides of rainbow-costumed natives swept along , this way and that , in massed and bewildering confusion , eager , anxious , belated , distressed ; and washed up to the long trains and flowed into them with their packs and bundles , and disappeared , followed at once by the next wash , the next wave .
Parsing [sent. 5170 len. 95]: And here and there , in the midst of this hurly-burly , and seemingly undisturbed by it , sat great groups of natives on the bare stone floor , -- young , slender brown women , old , gray wrinkled women , little soft brown babies , old men , young men , boys ; all poor people , but all the females among them , both big and little , bejeweled with cheap and showy nose-rings , toe-rings , leglets , and armlets , these things constituting all their wealth , no doubt .
Parsing [sent. 5171 len. 25]: These silent crowds sat there with their humble bundles and baskets and small household gear about them , and patiently waited -- for what ?
Parsing [sent. 5172 len. 17]: A train that was to start at some time or other during the day or night !
Parsing [sent. 5173 len. 27]: They had n't timed themselves well , but that was no matter -- the thing had been so ordered from on high , therefore why worry ?
Parsing [sent. 5174 len. 28]: There was plenty of time , hours and hours of it , and the thing that was to happen would happen -- there was no hurrying it .
Parsing [sent. 5175 len. 12]: The natives traveled third class , and at marvelously cheap rates .
Parsing [sent. 5176 len. 60]: They were packed and crammed into cars that held each about fifty ; and it was said that often a Brahmin of the highest caste was thus brought into personal touch , and consequent defilement , with persons of the lowest castes -- no doubt a very shocking thing if a body could understand it and properly appreciate it .
Parsing [sent. 5177 len. 80]: Yes , a Brahmin who did n't own a rupee and could n't borrow one , might have to touch elbows with a rich hereditary lord of inferior caste , inheritor of an ancient title a couple of yards long , and he would just have to stand it ; for if either of the two was allowed to go in the cars where the sacred white people were , it probably would n't be the august poor Brahmin .
Parsing [sent. 5178 len. 32]: There was an immense string of those third-class cars , for the natives travel by hordes ; and a weary hard night of it the occupants would have , no doubt .
Parsing [sent. 5179 len. 31]: When we reached our car , Satan and Barney had already arrived there with their train of porters carrying bedding and parasols and cigar boxes , and were at work .
Parsing [sent. 5180 len. 20]: We named him Barney for short ; we could n't use his real name , there was n't time .
Parsing [sent. 5181 len. 12]: It was a car that promised comfort ; indeed , luxury .
Parsing [sent. 5182 len. 23]: Yet the cost of it -- well , economy could no further go ; even in France ; not even in Italy .
Parsing [sent. 5183 len. 29]: It was built of the plainest and cheapest partially-smoothed boards , with a coating of dull paint on them , and there was nowhere a thought of decoration .
Parsing [sent. 5184 len. 19]: The floor was bare , but would not long remain so when the dust should begin to fly .
Parsing [sent. 5185 len. 94]: Across one end of the compartment ran a netting for the accommodation of hand-baggage ; at the other end was a door which would shut , upon compulsion , but would n't stay shut ; it opened into a narrow little closet which had a wash-bowl in one end of it , and a place to put a towel , in case you had one with you -- and you would be sure to have towels , because you buy them with the bedding , knowing that the railway does n't furnish them .
Parsing [sent. 5186 len. 30]: On each side of the car , and running fore and aft , was a broad leather-covered sofa to sit on in the day and sleep on at night .
Parsing [sent. 5187 len. 20]: Over each sofa hung , by straps , a wide , flat , leather-covered shelf -- to sleep on .
Parsing [sent. 5188 len. 33]: In the daytime you can hitch it up against the wall , out of the way -- and then you have a big unencumbered and most comfortable room to spread out in .
Parsing [sent. 5189 len. 18]: No car in any country is quite its equal for comfort -LRB- and privacy -RRB- I think .
Parsing [sent. 5190 len. 25]: For usually there are but two persons in it ; and even when there are four there is but little sense of impaired privacy .
Parsing [sent. 5191 len. 29]: Our own cars at home can surpass the railway world in all details but that one : they have no cosiness ; there are too many people together .
Parsing [sent. 5192 len. 15]: At the foot of each sofa was a side-door , for entrance and exit .
Parsing [sent. 5193 len. 43]: Along the whole length of the sofa on each side of the car ran a row of large single-plate windows , of a blue tint -- blue to soften the bitter glare of the sun and protect one 's eyes from torture .
Parsing [sent. 5194 len. 15]: These could be let down out of the way when one wanted the breeze .
Parsing [sent. 5195 len. 37]: In the roof were two oil lamps which gave a light strong enough to read by ; each had a green-cloth attachment by which it could be covered when the light should be no longer needed .
Parsing [sent. 5196 len. 66]: While we talked outside with friends , Barney and Satan placed the hand-baggage , books , fruits , and soda-bottles in the racks , and the hold-alls and heavy baggage in the closet , hung the overcoats and sun-helmets and towels on the hooks , hoisted the two bed-shelves up out of the way , then shouldered their bedding and retired to the third class .
Parsing [sent. 5197 len. 40]: Now then , you see what a handsome , spacious , light , airy , homelike place it was , wherein to walk up and down , or sit and write , or stretch out and read and smoke .
Parsing [sent. 5198 len. 16]: A central door in the forward end of the compartment opened into a similar compartment .
Parsing [sent. 5199 len. 9]: It was occupied by my wife and daughter .
Parsing [sent. 5200 len. 67]: About nine in the evening , while we halted a while at a station , Barney and Satan came and undid the clumsy big hold-alls , and spread the bedding on the sofas in both compartments -- mattresses , sheets , gay coverlets , pillows , all complete ; there are no chambermaids in India -- apparently it was an office that was never heard of .
Parsing [sent. 5201 len. 32]: Then they closed the communicating door , nimbly tidied up our place , put the night-clothing on the beds and the slippers under them , then returned to their own quarters .
Parsing [sent. 5202 len. 3]: January 31 .
Parsing [sent. 5203 len. 30]: It was novel and pleasant , and I stayed awake as long as I could , to enjoy it , and to read about those strange people the Thugs .
Parsing [sent. 5204 len. 14]: In my sleep they remained with me , and tried to strangle me .
Parsing [sent. 5205 len. 46]: The leader of the gang was that giant Hindoo who was such a picture in the strong light when we were leaving those Hindoo betrothal festivities at two o'clock in the morning -- Rao Bahadur Baskirao Balinkanje Pitale , Vakeel to the Gaikwar of Baroda .
Parsing [sent. 5206 len. 30]: It was he that brought me the invitation from his master to go to Baroda and lecture to that prince -- and now he was misbehaving in my dreams .
Parsing [sent. 5207 len. 8]: But all things can happen in dreams .
Parsing [sent. 5208 len. 97]: It is indeed as the Sweet Singer of Michigan says -- irrelevantly , of course , for the one and unfailing great quality which distinguishes her poetry from Shakespeare 's and makes it precious to us is its stern and simple irrelevancy : My heart was gay and happy , This was ever in my mind , There is better times a coming , And I hope some day to find Myself capable of composing , It was my heart 's delight To compose on a sentimental subject If it came in my mind just right .

Parsing [sent. 5211 len. 6]: Arrived at 7 this morning .
Parsing [sent. 5212 len. 8]: The dawn was just beginning to show .
Parsing [sent. 5213 len. 30]: It was forlorn to have to turn out in a strange place at such a time , and the blinking lights in the station made it seem night still .
Parsing [sent. 5214 len. 27]: But the gentlemen who had come to receive us were there with their servants , and they make quick work ; there was no lost time .
Parsing [sent. 5215 len. 40]: We were soon outside and moving swiftly through the soft gray light , and presently were comfortably housed -- with more servants to help than we were used to , and with rather embarassingly important officials to direct them .
Parsing [sent. 5216 len. 23]: But it was custom ; they spoke Ballarat English , their bearing was charming and hospitable , and so all went well .
Parsing [sent. 5217 len. 5]: Breakfast was a satisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 5218 len. 66]: Across the lawns was visible in the distance through the open window an Indian well , with two oxen tramping leisurely up and down long inclines , drawing water ; and out of the stillness came the suffering screech of the machinery -- not quite musical , and yet soothingly melancholy and dreamy and reposeful -- a wail of lost spirits , one might imagine .
Parsing [sent. 5219 len. 26]: And commemorative and reminiscent , perhaps ; for of course the Thugs used to throw people down that well when they were done with them .
Parsing [sent. 5220 len. 11]: After breakfast the day began , a sufficiently busy one .
Parsing [sent. 5221 len. 78]: We were driven by winding roads through a vast park , with noble forests of great trees , and with tangles and jungles of lovely growths of a humbler sort ; and at one place three large gray apes came out and pranced across the road -- a good deal of a surprise and an unpleasant one , for such creatures belong in the menagerie , and they look artificial and out of place in a wilderness .
Parsing [sent. 5222 len. 16]: We came to the city , by and by , and drove all through it .
Parsing [sent. 5223 len. 20]: Intensely Indian , it was , and crumbly , and mouldering , and immemorially old , to all appearance .
Parsing [sent. 5224 len. 129]: And the houses -- oh , indescribably quaint and curious they were , with their fronts an elaborate lace-work of intricate and beautiful wood-carving , and now and then further adorned with rude pictures of elephants and princes and gods done in shouting colors ; and all the ground floors along these cramped and narrow lanes occupied as shops -- shops unbelievably small and impossibly packed with merchantable rubbish , and with nine-tenths-naked natives squatting at their work of hammering , pounding , brazing , soldering , sewing , designing , cooking , measuring out grain , grinding it , repairing idols -- and then the swarm of ragged and noisy humanity under the horses ' feet and everywhere , and the pervading reek and fume and smell !
Parsing [sent. 5225 len. 7]: It was all wonderful and delightful .
Parsing [sent. 5226 len. 26]: Imagine a file of elephants marching through such a crevice of a street and scraping the paint off both sides of it with their hides .
Parsing [sent. 5227 len. 40]: How big they must look , and how little they must make the houses look ; and when the elephants are in their glittering court costume , what a contrast they must make with the humble and sordid surroundings .
Parsing [sent. 5228 len. 29]: And when a mad elephant goes raging through , belting right and left with his trunk , how do these swarms of people get out of the way ?
Parsing [sent. 5229 len. 24]: I suppose it is a thing which happens now and then in the mad season -LRB- for elephants have a mad season -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 5230 len. 8]: I wonder how old the town is .
Parsing [sent. 5231 len. 66]: There are patches of building -- massive structures , monuments , apparently -- that are so battered and worn , and seemingly so tired and so burdened with the weight of age , and so dulled and stupefied with trying to remember things they forgot before history began , that they give one the feeling that they must have been a part of original Creation .
Parsing [sent. 5232 len. 33]: This is indeed one of the oldest of the princedoms of India , and has always been celebrated for its barbaric pomps and splendors , and for the wealth of its princes .
Parsing [sent. 5233 len. 3]: CHAPTER XLV .
Parsing [sent. 5234 len. 33]: It takes your enemy and your friend , working together , to hurt you to the heart ; the one to slander you and the other to get the news to you .
Parsing [sent. 5235 len. 9]: -- Pudd ` nhead Wilson 's New Calendar .
Parsing [sent. 5236 len. 69]: Out of the town again ; a long drive through open country , by winding roads among secluded villages nestling in the inviting shade of tropic vegetation , a Sabbath stillness everywhere , sometimes a pervading sense of solitude , but always barefoot natives gliding by like spirits , without sound of footfall , and others in the distance dissolving away and vanishing like the creatures of dreams .
Parsing [sent. 5237 len. 30]: Now and then a string of stately camels passed by -- always interesting things to look at -- and they were velvet-shod by nature , and made no noise .
Parsing [sent. 5238 len. 13]: Indeed , there were no noises of any sort in this paradise .
Parsing [sent. 5239 len. 34]: Yes , once there was one , for a moment : a file of native convicts passed along in charge of an officer , and we caught the soft clink of their chains .
Parsing [sent. 5240 len. 32]: In a retired spot , resting himself under a tree , was a holy person -- a naked black fakeer , thin and skinny , and whitey-gray all over with ashes .
Parsing [sent. 5241 len. 52]: By and by to the elephant stables , and I took a ride ; but it was by request -- I did not ask for it , and did n't want it ; but I took it , because otherwise they would have thought I was afraid , which I was .
Parsing [sent. 5242 len. 69]: The elephant kneels down , by command -- one end of him at a time -- and you climb the ladder and get into the howdah , and then he gets up , one end at a time , just as a ship gets up over a wave ; and after that , as he strides monstrously about , his motion is much like a ship 's motion .
Parsing [sent. 5243 len. 46]: The mahout bores into the back of his head with a great iron prod and you wonder at his temerity and at the elephant 's patience , and you think that perhaps the patience will not last ; but it does , and nothing happens .
Parsing [sent. 5244 len. 42]: The mahout talks to the elephant in a low voice all the time , and the elephant seems to understand it all and to be pleased with it ; and he obeys every order in the most contented and docile way .
Parsing [sent. 5245 len. 44]: Among these twenty-five elephants were two which were larger than any I had ever seen before , and if I had thought I could learn to not be afraid , I would have taken one of them while the police were not looking .
Parsing [sent. 5246 len. 35]: In the howdah-house there were many howdahs that were made of silver , one of gold , and one of old ivory , and equipped with cushions and canopies of rich and costly stuffs .
Parsing [sent. 5247 len. 69]: The wardrobe of the elephants was there , too ; vast velvet covers stiff and heavy with gold embroidery ; and bells of silver and gold ; and ropes of these metals for fastening the things on -- harness , so to speak ; and monster hoops of massive gold for the elephant to wear on his ankles when he is out in procession on business of state .
Parsing [sent. 5248 len. 29]: But we did not see the treasury of crown jewels , and that was a disappointment , for in mass and richness it ranks only second in India .
Parsing [sent. 5249 len. 25]: By mistake we were taken to see the new palace instead , and we used up the last remnant of our spare time there .
Parsing [sent. 5250 len. 24]: It was a pity , too ; for the new palace is mixed modern American-European , and has not a merit except costliness .
Parsing [sent. 5251 len. 14]: It is wholly foreign to India , and impudent and out of place .
Parsing [sent. 5252 len. 5]: The architect has escaped .
Parsing [sent. 5253 len. 15]: This comes of overdoing the suppression of the Thugs ; they had their merits .
Parsing [sent. 5254 len. 15]: The old palace is oriental and charming , and in consonance with the country .
Parsing [sent. 5255 len. 25]: The old palace would still be great if there were nothing of it but the spacious and lofty hall where the durbars are held .
Parsing [sent. 5256 len. 42]: It is not a good place to lecture in , on account of the echoes , but it is a good place to hold durbars in and regulate the affairs of a kingdom , and that is what it is for .
Parsing [sent. 5257 len. 20]: If I had it I would have a durbar every day , instead of once or twice a year .
Parsing [sent. 5258 len. 7]: The prince is an educated gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 5259 len. 5]: His culture is European .
Parsing [sent. 5260 len. 8]: He has been in Europe five times .
Parsing [sent. 5261 len. 38]: People say that this is costly amusement for him , since in crossing the sea he must sometimes be obliged to drink water from vessels that are more or less public , and thus damage his caste .
Parsing [sent. 5262 len. 23]: To get it purified again he must make pilgrimage to some renowned Hindoo temples and contribute a fortune or two to them .
Parsing [sent. 5263 len. 24]: His people are like the other Hindoos , profoundly religious ; and they could not be content with a master who was impure .
Parsing [sent. 5264 len. 24]: We failed to see the jewels , but we saw the gold cannon and the silver one -- they seemed to be six-pounders .
Parsing [sent. 5265 len. 18]: They were not designed for business , but for salutes upon rare and particularly important state occasions .
Parsing [sent. 5266 len. 28]: An ancestor of the present Gaikwar had the silver one made , and a subsequent ancestor had the gold one made , in order to outdo him .
Parsing [sent. 5267 len. 23]: This sort of artillery is in keeping with the traditions of Baroda , which was of old famous for style and show .
Parsing [sent. 5268 len. 25]: It used to entertain visiting rajahs and viceroys with tiger-fights , elephant-fights , illuminations , and elephant-processions of the most glittering and gorgeous character .
Parsing [sent. 5269 len. 10]: It makes the circus a pale , poor thing .
Parsing [sent. 5270 len. 30]: In the train , during a part of the return journey from Baroda , we had the company of a gentleman who had with him a remarkable looking dog .
Parsing [sent. 5271 len. 43]: I had not seen one of its kind before , as far as I could remember ; though of course I might have seen one and not noticed it , for I am not acquainted with dogs , but only with cats .
Parsing [sent. 5272 len. 29]: This dog 's coat was smooth and shiny and black , and I think it had tan trimmings around the edges of the dog , and perhaps underneath .
Parsing [sent. 5273 len. 29]: It was a long , low dog , with very short , strange legs -- legs that curved inboard , something like parentheses turned the wrong way -LRB- .
Parsing [sent. 5274 len. 16]: Indeed , it was made on the plan of a bench for length and lowness .
Parsing [sent. 5275 len. 30]: It seemed to be satisfied , but I thought the plan poor , and structurally weak , on account of the distance between the forward supports and those abaft .
Parsing [sent. 5276 len. 35]: With age the dog 's back was likely to sag ; and it seemed to me that it would have been a stronger and more practicable dog if it had had some more legs .
Parsing [sent. 5277 len. 27]: It had not begun to sag yet , but the shape of the legs showed that the undue weight imposed upon them was beginning to tell .
Parsing [sent. 5278 len. 20]: It had a long nose , and floppy ears that hung down , and a resigned expression of countenance .
Parsing [sent. 5279 len. 44]: I did not like to ask what kind of a dog it was , or how it came to be deformed , for it was plain that the gentleman was very fond of it , and naturally he could be sensitive about it .
Parsing [sent. 5280 len. 15]: From delicacy I thought it best not to seem to notice it too much .
Parsing [sent. 5281 len. 25]: No doubt a man with a dog like that feels just as a person does who has a child that is out of true .
Parsing [sent. 5282 len. 35]: The gentleman was not merely fond of the dog , he was also proud of it -- just the same again , as a mother feels about her child when it is an idiot .
Parsing [sent. 5283 len. 24]: I could see that he was proud of it , not-withstanding it was such a long dog and looked so resigned and pious .
Parsing [sent. 5284 len. 21]: It had been all over the world with him , and had been pilgriming like that for years and years .
Parsing [sent. 5285 len. 22]: It had traveled 50,000 miles by sea and rail , and had ridden in front of him on his horse 8,000 .
Parsing [sent. 5286 len. 21]: It had a silver medal from the Geographical Society of Great Britain for its travels , and I saw it .
Parsing [sent. 5287 len. 19]: It had won prizes in dog shows , both in India and in England -- I saw them .
Parsing [sent. 5288 len. 20]: He said its pedigree was on record in the Kennel Club , and that it was a well-known dog .
Parsing [sent. 5289 len. 17]: He said a great many people in London could recognize it the moment they saw it .
Parsing [sent. 5290 len. 33]: I did not say anything , but I did not think it anything strange ; I should know that dog again , myself , yet I am not careful about noticing dogs .
Parsing [sent. 5291 len. 19]: He said that when he walked along in London , people often stopped and looked at the dog .
Parsing [sent. 5292 len. 57]: Of course I did not say anything , for I did not want to hurt his feelings , but I could have explained to him that if you take a great long low dog like that and waddle it along the street anywhere in the world and not charge anything , people will stop and look .
Parsing [sent. 5293 len. 9]: He was gratified because the dog took prizes .
Parsing [sent. 5294 len. 17]: But that was nothing ; if I were built like that I could take prizes myself .
Parsing [sent. 5295 len. 36]: I wished I knew what kind of a dog it was , and what it was for , but I could not very well ask , for that would show that I did not know .
Parsing [sent. 5296 len. 19]: Not that I want a dog like that , but only to know the secret of its birth .
Parsing [sent. 5297 len. 36]: I think he was going to hunt elephants with it , because I know , from remarks dropped by him , that he has hunted large game in India and Africa , and likes it .
Parsing [sent. 5298 len. 20]: But I think that if he tries to hunt elephants with it , he is going to be disappointed .
Parsing [sent. 5299 len. 11]: I do not believe that it is suited for elephants .
Parsing [sent. 5300 len. 14]: It lacks energy , it lacks force of character , it lacks bitterness .
Parsing [sent. 5301 len. 13]: These things all show in the meekness and resignation of its expression .
Parsing [sent. 5302 len. 13]: It would not attack an elephant , I am sure of it .
Parsing [sent. 5303 len. 25]: It might not run if it saw one coming , but it looked to me like a dog that would sit down and pray .
Parsing [sent. 5304 len. 42]: I wish he had told me what breed it was , if there are others ; but I shall know the dog next time , and then if I can bring myself to it I will put delicacy aside and ask .
Parsing [sent. 5305 len. 59]: If I seem strangely interested in dogs , I have a reason for it ; for a dog saved me from an embarrassing position once , and that has made me grateful to these animals ; and if by study I could learn to tell some of the kinds from the others , I should be greatly pleased .
Parsing [sent. 5306 len. 20]: I only know one kind apart , yet , and that is the kind that saved me that time .
Parsing [sent. 5307 len. 23]: I always know that kind when I meet it , and if it is hungry or lost I take care of it .
Parsing [sent. 5308 len. 14]: The matter happened in this way : It was years and years ago .
Parsing [sent. 5309 len. 29]: I had received a note from Mr. Augustin Daly of the Fifth Avenue Theatre , asking me to call the next time I should be in New York .
Parsing [sent. 5310 len. 28]: I was writing plays , in those days , and he was admiring them and trying to get me a chance to get them played in Siberia .
Parsing [sent. 5311 len. 21]: I took the first train -- the early one -- the one that leaves Hartford at 8.29 in the morning .
Parsing [sent. 5312 len. 22]: At New Haven I bought a paper , and found it filled with glaring display-lines about a `` bench-show '' there .
Parsing [sent. 5313 len. 28]: I had often heard of bench-shows , but had never felt any interest in them , because I supposed they were lectures that were not well attended .
Parsing [sent. 5314 len. 16]: It turned out , now , that it was not that , but a dog-show .
Parsing [sent. 5315 len. 41]: There was a double-leaded column about the king-feature of this one , which was called a Saint Bernard , and was worth $ 10,000 , and was known to be the largest and finest of his species in the world .
Parsing [sent. 5316 len. 65]: I read all this with interest , because out of my school-boy readings I dimly remembered how the priests and pilgrims of St. Bernard used to go out in the storms and dig these dogs out of the snowdrifts when lost and exhausted , and give them brandy and save their lives , and drag them to the monastery and restore them with gruel .
Parsing [sent. 5317 len. 27]: Also , there was a picture of this prize-dog in the paper , a noble great creature with a benignant countenance , standing by a table .
Parsing [sent. 5318 len. 19]: He was placed in that way so that one could get a right idea of his great dimensions .
Parsing [sent. 5319 len. 23]: You could see that he was just a shade higher than the table -- indeed , a huge fellow for a dog .
Parsing [sent. 5320 len. 11]: Then there was a description which went into the details .
Parsing [sent. 5321 len. 38]: It gave his enormous weight -- 150 1/2 pounds , and his length 4 feet 2 inches , from stem to stern-post ; and his height -- 3 feet 1 inch , to the top of his back .
Parsing [sent. 5322 len. 46]: The pictures and the figures so impressed me , that I could see the beautiful colossus before me , and I kept on thinking about him for the next two hours ; then I reached New York , and he dropped out of my mind .
Parsing [sent. 5323 len. 45]: In the swirl and tumult of the hotel lobby I ran across Mr. Daly 's comedian , the late James Lewis , of beloved memory , and I casually mentioned that I was going to call upon Mr. Daly in the evening at 8 .
Parsing [sent. 5324 len. 10]: He looked surprised , and said he reckoned not .
Parsing [sent. 5325 len. 10]: For answer I handed him Mr. Daly 's note .
Parsing [sent. 5326 len. 22]: Its substance was : `` Come to my private den , over the theater , where we can not be interrupted .
Parsing [sent. 5327 len. 11]: And come by the back way , not the front .
Parsing [sent. 5328 len. 40]: No. 642 Sixth Avenue is a cigar shop ; pass through it and you are in a paved court , with high buildings all around ; enter the second door on the left , and come up stairs . ''
Parsing [sent. 5329 len. 6]: `` Is this all ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5330 len. 7]: `` Yes , '' I said .
Parsing [sent. 5331 len. 13]: `` Well , you 'll never get in '' `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5332 len. 6]: `` Because you wo n't .
Parsing [sent. 5333 len. 29]: Or if you do you can draw on me for a hundred dollars ; for you will be the first man that has accomplished it in twenty-five years .
Parsing [sent. 5334 len. 13]: I ca n't think what Mr. Daly can have been absorbed in .
Parsing [sent. 5335 len. 30]: He has forgotten a most important detail , and he will feel humiliated in the morning when he finds that you tried to get in and could n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 5336 len. 9]: `` Why , what is the trouble ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5337 len. 6]: `` I 'll tell you .
Parsing [sent. 5338 len. 32]: You see -- '' At that point we were swept apart by the crowd , somebody detained me with a moment 's talk , and we did not get together again .
Parsing [sent. 5339 len. 14]: But it did not matter ; I believed he was joking , anyway .
Parsing [sent. 5340 len. 22]: At eight in the evening I passed through the cigar shop and into the court and knocked at the second door .
Parsing [sent. 5341 len. 5]: `` Come in ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5342 len. 3]: I entered .
Parsing [sent. 5343 len. 24]: It was a small room , carpetless , dusty , with a naked deal table , and two cheap wooden chairs for furniture .
Parsing [sent. 5344 len. 19]: A giant Irishman was standing there , with shirt collar and vest unbuttoned , and no coat on .
Parsing [sent. 5345 len. 23]: I put my hat on the table , and was about to say something , when the Irishman took the innings himself .
Parsing [sent. 5346 len. 19]: And not with marked courtesy of tone : `` Well , sor , what will you have ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5347 len. 14]: I was a little disconcerted , and my easy confidence suffered a shrinkage .
Parsing [sent. 5348 len. 16]: The man stood as motionless as Gibraltar , and kept his unblinking eye upon me .
Parsing [sent. 5349 len. 8]: It was very embarrassing , very humiliating .
Parsing [sent. 5350 len. 35]: I stammered at a false start or two ; then -- `` I have just run down from -- '' `` Av ye plaze , ye 'll not smoke here , ye understand . ''
Parsing [sent. 5351 len. 34]: I laid my cigar on the window-ledge ; chased my flighty thoughts a moment , then said in a placating manner : `` I -- I have come to see Mr. Daly . ''
Parsing [sent. 5352 len. 10]: `` Oh , ye have , have ye ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5353 len. 13]: `` Yes '' `` Well , ye 'll not see him . ''
Parsing [sent. 5354 len. 9]: `` But he asked me to come . ''
Parsing [sent. 5355 len. 10]: `` Oh , he did , did he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5356 len. 19]: `` Yes , he sent me this note , and -- '' `` Lem me see it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5357 len. 22]: For a moment I fancied there would be a change in the atmosphere , now ; but this idea was premature .
Parsing [sent. 5358 len. 12]: The big man was examining the note searchingly under the gas-jet .
Parsing [sent. 5359 len. 19]: A glance showed me that he had it upside down -- disheartening evidence that he could not read .
Parsing [sent. 5360 len. 8]: `` Is ut his own handwrite ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5361 len. 9]: `` Yes -- he wrote it himself . ''
Parsing [sent. 5362 len. 8]: `` He did , did he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5363 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 5364 len. 4]: `` H 'm .
Parsing [sent. 5365 len. 13]: Well , then , why ud he write it like that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5366 len. 7]: `` How do you mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5367 len. 15]: `` I mane , why wud n't he put his naime to ut ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5368 len. 7]: `` His name is to it .
Parsing [sent. 5369 len. 13]: That 's not it -- you are looking at my name . ''
Parsing [sent. 5370 len. 20]: I thought that that was a home shot , but he did not betray that he had been hit .
Parsing [sent. 5371 len. 20]: He said : `` It 's not an aisy one to spell ; how do you pronounce ut ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5372 len. 5]: `` Mark Twain . ''
Parsing [sent. 5373 len. 4]: `` H 'm .
Parsing [sent. 5374 len. 3]: H 'm .
Parsing [sent. 5375 len. 3]: Mike Train .
Parsing [sent. 5376 len. 3]: H 'm .
Parsing [sent. 5377 len. 6]: I do n't remember ut .
Parsing [sent. 5378 len. 11]: What is it ye want to see him about ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5379 len. 18]: `` It is n't I that want to see him , he wants to see me . ''
Parsing [sent. 5380 len. 10]: `` Oh , he does , does he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5381 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 5382 len. 11]: `` What does he want to see ye about ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5383 len. 7]: `` I do n't know . ''
Parsing [sent. 5384 len. 6]: `` Ye do n't know !
Parsing [sent. 5385 len. 7]: And ye confess it , becod !
Parsing [sent. 5386 len. 15]: Well , I can tell ye wan thing -- ye 'll not see him .
Parsing [sent. 5387 len. 7]: Are ye in the business ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5388 len. 5]: `` What business ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5389 len. 6]: `` The show business . ''
Parsing [sent. 5390 len. 4]: A fatal question .
Parsing [sent. 5391 len. 7]: I recognized that I was defeated .
Parsing [sent. 5392 len. 69]: If I answered no , he would cut the matter short and wave me to the door without the grace of a word -- I saw it in his uncompromising eye ; if I said I was a lecturer , he would despise me , and dismiss me with opprobrious words ; if I said I was a dramatist , he would throw me out of the window .
Parsing [sent. 5393 len. 29]: I saw that my case was hopeless , so I chose the course which seemed least humiliating : I would pocket my shame and glide out without answering .
Parsing [sent. 5394 len. 6]: The silence was growing lengthy .
Parsing [sent. 5395 len. 7]: `` I 'll ask ye again .
Parsing [sent. 5396 len. 9]: Are ye in the show business yerself ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5397 len. 4]: `` Yes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5398 len. 39]: I said it with splendid confidence ; for in that moment the very twin of that grand New Haven dog loafed into the room , and I saw that Irishman 's eye light eloquently with pride and affection .
Parsing [sent. 5399 len. 4]: `` Ye are ?
Parsing [sent. 5400 len. 6]: And what is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5401 len. 11]: `` I 've got a bench-show in New Haven . ''
Parsing [sent. 5402 len. 6]: The weather did change then .
Parsing [sent. 5403 len. 8]: `` You do n't say , sir !
Parsing [sent. 5404 len. 8]: And that 's your show , sir !
Parsing [sent. 5405 len. 29]: Oh , it 's a grand show , it 's a wonderful show , sir , and a proud man I am to see your honor this day .
Parsing [sent. 5406 len. 33]: And ye 'll be an expert , sir , and ye 'll know all about dogs -- more than ever they know theirselves , I 'll take me oath to ut . ''
Parsing [sent. 5407 len. 16]: I said , with modesty : `` I believe I have some reputation that way .
Parsing [sent. 5408 len. 9]: In fact , my business requires it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5409 len. 9]: `` Ye have some reputation , your honor !
Parsing [sent. 5410 len. 5]: Bedad I believe you !
Parsing [sent. 5411 len. 22]: There 's not a jintleman in the worrld that can lay over ye in the judgmint of a dog , sir .
Parsing [sent. 5412 len. 35]: Now I 'll vinture that your honor 'll know that dog 's dimensions there better than he knows them his own self , and just by the casting of your educated eye upon him .
Parsing [sent. 5413 len. 15]: Would you mind giving a guess , if ye 'll be so good ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5414 len. 11]: I knew that upon my answer would depend my fate .
Parsing [sent. 5415 len. 35]: If I made this dog bigger than the prize-dog , it would be bad diplomacy , and suspicious ; if I fell too far short of the prizedog , that would be equally damaging .
Parsing [sent. 5416 len. 32]: The dog was standing by the table , and I believed I knew the difference between him and the one whose picture I had seen in the newspaper to a shade .
Parsing [sent. 5417 len. 46]: I spoke promptly up and said : `` It 's no trouble to guess this noble creature 's figures : height , three feet ; length , four feet and three-quarters of an inch ; weight , a hundred and forty-eight and a quarter . ''
Parsing [sent. 5418 len. 38]: The man snatched his hat from its peg and danced on it with joy , shouting : `` Ye 've hardly missed it the hair 's breadth , hardly the shade of a shade , your honor !
Parsing [sent. 5419 len. 19]: Oh , it 's the miraculous eye ye 've got , for the judgmint of a dog ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5420 len. 98]: And still pouring out his admiration of my capacities , he snatched off his vest and scoured off one of the wooden chairs with it , and scrubbed it and polished it , and said : `` There , sit down , your honor , I 'm ashamed of meself that I forgot ye were standing all this time ; and do put on your hat , ye must n't take cold , it 's a drafty place ; and here is your cigar , sir , a getting cold , I 'll give ye a light .
Parsing [sent. 5421 len. 2]: There .
Parsing [sent. 5422 len. 76]: The place is all yours , sir , and if ye 'll just put your feet on the table and make yourself at home , I 'll stir around and get a candle and light ye up the ould crazy stairs and see that ye do n't come to anny harm , for be this time Mr. Daly 'll be that impatient to see your honor that he 'll be taking the roof off . ''
Parsing [sent. 5423 len. 47]: He conducted me cautiously and tenderly up the stairs , lighting the way and protecting me with friendly warnings , then pushed the door open and bowed me in and went his way , mumbling hearty things about my wonderful eye for points of a dog .
Parsing [sent. 5424 len. 11]: Mr. Daly was writing and had his back to me .
Parsing [sent. 5425 len. 26]: He glanced over his shoulder presently , then jumped up and said -- `` Oh , dear me , I forgot all about giving instructions .
Parsing [sent. 5426 len. 11]: I was just writing you to beg a thousand pardons .
Parsing [sent. 5427 len. 8]: But how is it you are here ?
Parsing [sent. 5428 len. 8]: How did you get by that Irishman ?
Parsing [sent. 5429 len. 15]: You are the first man that 's done it in five and twenty years .
Parsing [sent. 5430 len. 22]: You did n't bribe him , I know that ; there 's not money enough in New York to do it .
Parsing [sent. 5431 len. 28]: And you did n't persuade him ; he is all ice and iron : there is n't a soft place nor a warm one in him anywhere .
Parsing [sent. 5432 len. 5]: What is your secret ?
Parsing [sent. 5433 len. 31]: Look here ; you owe me a hundred dollars for unintentionally giving you a chance to perform a miracle -- for it is a miracle that you 've done . ''
Parsing [sent. 5434 len. 18]: `` That is all right , '' I said , `` collect it of Jimmy Lewis . ''
Parsing [sent. 5435 len. 56]: That good dog not only did me that good turn in the time of my need , but he won for me the envious reputation among all the theatrical people from the Atlantic to the Pacific of being the only man in history who had ever run the blockade of Augustin Daly 's back door .
Parsing [sent. 5436 len. 3]: CHAPTER XLVI .
Parsing [sent. 5437 len. 19]: If the desire to kill and the opportunity to kill came always together , who would escape hanging .
Parsing [sent. 5438 len. 9]: -- Pudd ` nhead Wilson 's New Calendar .
Parsing [sent. 5439 len. 4]: On the Train .
Parsing [sent. 5440 len. 96]: Fifty years ago , when I was a boy in the then remote and sparsely peopled Mississippi valley , vague tales and rumors of a mysterious body of professional murderers came wandering in from a country which was constructively as far from us as the constellations blinking in space -- India ; vague tales and rumors of a sect called Thugs , who waylaid travelers in lonely places and killed them for the contentment of a god whom they worshiped ; tales which everybody liked to listen to and nobody believed , except with reservations .
Parsing [sent. 5441 len. 13]: It was considered that the stories had gathered bulk on their travels .
Parsing [sent. 5442 len. 9]: The matter died down and a lull followed .
Parsing [sent. 5443 len. 18]: Then Eugene Sue 's `` Wandering Jew '' appeared , and made great talk for a while .
Parsing [sent. 5444 len. 43]: One character in it was a chief of Thugs -- `` Feringhea '' -- a mysterious and terrible Indian who was as slippery and sly as a serpent , and as deadly ; and he stirred up the Thug interest once more .
Parsing [sent. 5445 len. 6]: But it did not last .
Parsing [sent. 5446 len. 10]: It presently died again this time to stay dead .
Parsing [sent. 5447 len. 36]: At first glance it seems strange that this should have happened ; but really it was not strange -- on the contrary -- it was natural ; I mean on our side of the water .
Parsing [sent. 5448 len. 31]: For the source whence the Thug tales mainly came was a Government Report , and without doubt was not republished in America ; it was probably never even seen there .
Parsing [sent. 5449 len. 7]: Government Reports have no general circulation .
Parsing [sent. 5450 len. 16]: They are distributed to the few , and are not always read by those few .
Parsing [sent. 5451 len. 19]: I heard of this Report for the first time a day or two ago , and borrowed it .
Parsing [sent. 5452 len. 22]: It is full of fascinations ; and it turns those dim , dark fairy tales of my boyhood days into realities .
Parsing [sent. 5453 len. 23]: The Report was made in 1839 by Major Sleeman , of the Indian Service , and was printed in Calcutta in 1840 .
Parsing [sent. 5454 len. 36]: It is a clumsy , great , fat , poor sample of the printer 's art , but good enough for a government printing-office in that old day and in that remote region , perhaps .
Parsing [sent. 5455 len. 27]: To Major Sleeman was given the general superintendence of the giant task of ridding India of Thuggee , and he and his seventeen assistants accomplished it .
Parsing [sent. 5456 len. 8]: It was the Augean Stables over again .
Parsing [sent. 5457 len. 46]: Captain Vallancey , writing in a Madras journal in those old times , makes this remark : `` The day that sees this far-spread evil eradicated from India and known only in name , will greatly tend to immortalize British rule in the East . ''
Parsing [sent. 5458 len. 32]: He did not overestimate the magnitude and difficulty of the work , nor the immensity of the credit which would justly be due to British rule in case it was accomplished .
Parsing [sent. 5459 len. 42]: Thuggee became known to the British authorities in India about 1810 , but its wide prevalence was not suspected ; it was not regarded as a serious matter , and no systematic measures were taken for its suppression until about 1830 .
Parsing [sent. 5460 len. 24]: About that time Major Sleeman captured Eugene Sue 's Thug-chief , `` Feringhea , '' and got him to turn King 's evidence .
Parsing [sent. 5461 len. 14]: The revelations were so stupefying that Sleeman was not able to believe them .
Parsing [sent. 5462 len. 60]: Sleeman thought he knew every criminal within his jurisdiction , and that the worst of them were merely thieves ; but Feringhea told him that he was in reality living in the midst of a swarm of professional murderers ; that they had been all about him for many years , and that they buried their dead close by .
Parsing [sent. 5463 len. 46]: These seemed insane tales ; but Feringhea said come and see -- and he took him to a grave and dug up a hundred bodies , and told him all the circumstances of the killings , and named the Thugs who had done the work .
Parsing [sent. 5464 len. 6]: It was a staggering business .
Parsing [sent. 5465 len. 31]: Sleeman captured some of these Thugs and proceeded to examine them separately , and with proper precautions against collusion ; for he would not believe any Indian 's unsupported word .
Parsing [sent. 5466 len. 29]: The evidence gathered proved the truth of what Feringhea had said , and also revealed the fact that gangs of Thugs were plying their trade all over India .
Parsing [sent. 5467 len. 26]: The astonished government now took hold of Thuggee , and for ten years made systematic and relentless war upon it , and finally destroyed it .
Parsing [sent. 5468 len. 11]: Gang after gang was captured , tried , and punished .
Parsing [sent. 5469 len. 15]: The Thugs were harried and hunted from one end of India to the other .
Parsing [sent. 5470 len. 38]: The government got all their secrets out of them ; and also got the names of the members of the bands , and recorded them in a book , together with their birthplaces and places of residence .
Parsing [sent. 5471 len. 38]: The Thugs were worshipers of Bhowanee ; and to this god they sacrificed anybody that came handy ; but they kept the dead man 's things themselves , for the god cared for nothing but the corpse .
Parsing [sent. 5472 len. 10]: Men were initiated into the sect with solemn ceremonies .
Parsing [sent. 5473 len. 28]: Then they were taught how to strangle a person with the sacred choke-cloth , but were not allowed to perform officially with it until after long practice .
Parsing [sent. 5474 len. 78]: No half-educated strangler could choke a man to death quickly enough to keep him from uttering a sound -- a muffled scream , gurgle , gasp , moan , or something of the sort ; but the expert 's work was instantaneous : the cloth was whipped around the victim 's neck , there was a sudden twist , and the head fell silently forward , the eyes starting from the sockets ; and all was over .
Parsing [sent. 5475 len. 7]: The Thug carefully guarded against resistance .
Parsing [sent. 5476 len. 21]: It was usual to to get the victims to sit down , for that was the handiest position for business .
Parsing [sent. 5477 len. 22]: If the Thug had planned India itself it could not have been more conveniently arranged for the needs of his occupation .
Parsing [sent. 5478 len. 6]: There were no public conveyances .
Parsing [sent. 5479 len. 7]: There were no conveyances for hire .
Parsing [sent. 5480 len. 21]: The traveler went on foot or in a bullock cart or on a horse which he bought for the purpose .
Parsing [sent. 5481 len. 40]: As soon as he was out of his own little State or principality he was among strangers ; nobody knew him , nobody took note of him , and from that time his movements could no longer be traced .
Parsing [sent. 5482 len. 23]: He did not stop in towns or villages , but camped outside of them and sent his servants in to buy provisions .
Parsing [sent. 5483 len. 7]: There were no habitations between villages .
Parsing [sent. 5484 len. 24]: Whenever he was between villages he was an easy prey , particularly as he usually traveled by night , to avoid the heat .
Parsing [sent. 5485 len. 40]: He was always being overtaken by strangers who offered him the protection of their company , or asked for the protection of his -- and these strangers were often Thugs , as he presently found out to his cost .
Parsing [sent. 5486 len. 41]: The landholders , the native police , the petty princes , the village officials , the customs officers were in many cases protectors and harborers of the Thugs , and betrayed travelers to them for a share of the spoil .
Parsing [sent. 5487 len. 28]: At first this condition of things made it next to impossible for the government to catch the marauders ; they were spirited away by these watchful friends .
Parsing [sent. 5488 len. 57]: All through a vast continent , thus infested , helpless people of every caste and kind moved along the paths and trails in couples and groups silently by night , carrying the commerce of the country -- treasure , jewels , money , and petty batches of silks , spices , and all manner of wares .
Parsing [sent. 5489 len. 8]: It was a paradise for the Thug .
Parsing [sent. 5490 len. 14]: When the autumn opened , the Thugs began to gather together by pre-concert .
Parsing [sent. 5491 len. 58]: Other people had to have interpreters at every turn , but not the Thugs ; they could talk together , no matter how far apart they were born , for they had a language of their own , and they had secret signs by which they knew each other for Thugs ; and they were always friends .
Parsing [sent. 5492 len. 32]: Even their diversities of religion and caste were sunk in devotion to their calling , and the Moslem and the high-caste and low-caste Hindoo were staunch and affectionate brothers in Thuggery .
Parsing [sent. 5493 len. 18]: When a gang had been assembled , they had religious worship , and waited for an omen .
Parsing [sent. 5494 len. 8]: They had definite notions about the omens .
Parsing [sent. 5495 len. 19]: The cries of certain animals were good omens , the cries of certain other creatures were bad omens .
Parsing [sent. 5496 len. 12]: A bad omen would stop proceedings and send the men home .
Parsing [sent. 5497 len. 9]: The sword and the strangling-cloth were sacred emblems .
Parsing [sent. 5498 len. 24]: The Thugs worshiped the sword at home before going out to the assembling-place ; the strangling-cloth was worshiped at the place of assembly .
Parsing [sent. 5499 len. 26]: The chiefs of most of the bands performed the religious ceremonies themselves ; but the Kaets delegated them to certain official stranglers -LRB- Chaurs -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 5500 len. 27]: The rites of the Kaets were so holy that no one but the Chaur was allowed to touch the vessels and other things used in them .
Parsing [sent. 5501 len. 55]: Thug methods exhibit a curious mixture of caution and the absence of it ; cold business calculation and sudden , unreflecting impulse ; but there were two details which were constant , and not subject to caprice : patient persistence in following up the prey , and pitilessness when the time came to act .
Parsing [sent. 5502 len. 10]: Caution was exhibited in the strength of the bands .
Parsing [sent. 5503 len. 26]: They never felt comfortable and confident unless their strength exceeded that of any party of travelers they were likely to meet by four or fivefold .
Parsing [sent. 5504 len. 20]: Yet it was never their purpose to attack openly , but only when the victims were off their guard .
Parsing [sent. 5505 len. 33]: When they got hold of a party of travelers they often moved along in their company several days , using all manner of arts to win their friendship and get their confidence .
Parsing [sent. 5506 len. 16]: At last , when this was accomplished to their satisfaction , the real business began .
Parsing [sent. 5507 len. 22]: A few Thugs were privately detached and sent forward in the dark to select a good killing-place and dig the graves .
Parsing [sent. 5508 len. 18]: When the rest reached the spot a halt was called , for a rest or a smoke .
Parsing [sent. 5509 len. 7]: The travelers were invited to sit .
Parsing [sent. 5510 len. 53]: By signs , the chief appointed certain Thugs to sit down in front of the travelers as if to wait upon them , others to sit down beside them and engage them in conversation , and certain expert stranglers to stand behind the travelers and be ready when the signal was given .
Parsing [sent. 5511 len. 15]: The signal was usually some commonplace remark , like `` Bring the tobacco . ''
Parsing [sent. 5512 len. 28]: Sometimes a considerable wait ensued after all the actors were in their places -- the chief was biding his time , in order to make everything sure .
Parsing [sent. 5513 len. 45]: Meantime , the talk droned on , dim figures moved about in the dull light , peace and tranquility reigned , the travelers resigned themselves to the pleasant reposefulness and comfort of the situation , unconscious of the death-angels standing motionless at their backs .
Parsing [sent. 5514 len. 18]: The time was ripe , now , and the signal came : `` Bring the tobacco . ''
Parsing [sent. 5515 len. 61]: There was a mute swift movement , all in the same instant the men at each victim 's sides seized his hands , the man in front seized his feet , and pulled , the man at his back whipped the cloth around his neck and gave it a twist -- the head sunk forward , the tragedy was over .
Parsing [sent. 5516 len. 33]: The bodies were stripped and covered up in the graves , the spoil packed for transportation , then the Thugs gave pious thanks to Bhowanee , and departed on further holy service .
Parsing [sent. 5517 len. 32]: The Report shows that the travelers moved in exceedingly small groups -- twos , threes , fours , as a rule ; a party with a dozen in it was rare .
Parsing [sent. 5518 len. 15]: The Thugs themselves seem to have been the only people who moved in force .
Parsing [sent. 5519 len. 32]: They went about in gangs of 10 , 15 , 25 , 40 , 60 , 100 , 150 , 200 , 250 , and one gang of 310 is mentioned .
Parsing [sent. 5520 len. 41]: Considering their numbers , their catch was not extraordinary -- particularly when you consider that they were not in the least fastidious , but took anybody they could get , whether rich or poor , and sometimes even killed children .
Parsing [sent. 5521 len. 19]: Now and then they killed women , but it was considered sinful to do it , and unlucky .
Parsing [sent. 5522 len. 11]: The `` season '' was six or eight months long .
Parsing [sent. 5523 len. 19]: One season the half dozen Bundelkand and Gwalior gangs aggregated 712 men , and they murdered 210 people .
Parsing [sent. 5524 len. 16]: One season the Malwa and Kandeish gangs aggregated 702 men , and they murdered 232 .
Parsing [sent. 5525 len. 17]: One season the Kandeish and Berar gangs aggregated 963 men , and they murdered 385 people .
Parsing [sent. 5526 len. 46]: Here is the tally-sheet of a gang of sixty Thugs for a whole season -- gang under two noted chiefs , `` Chotee and Sheik Nungoo from Gwalior '' : `` Left Poora , in Jhansee , and on arrival at Sarora murdered a traveler .
Parsing [sent. 5527 len. 14]: `` On nearly reaching Bhopal , met 3 Brahmins , and murdered them .
Parsing [sent. 5528 len. 15]: `` Cross the Nerbudda ; at a village called Hutteea , murdered a Hindoo .
Parsing [sent. 5529 len. 48]: `` Went through Aurungabad to Walagow ; there met a Havildar of the barber caste and 5 sepoys -LRB- native soldiers -RRB- ; in the evening came to Jokur , and in the morning killed them near the place where the treasure-bearers were killed the year before .
Parsing [sent. 5530 len. 19]: `` Between Jokur and Dholeea met a sepoy of the shepherd caste ; killed him in the jungle .
Parsing [sent. 5531 len. 34]: `` Passed through Dholeea and lodged in a village ; two miles beyond , on the road to Indore , met a Byragee -LRB- beggar-holy mendicant -RRB- ; murdered him at the Thapa .
Parsing [sent. 5532 len. 19]: `` In the morning , beyond the Thapa , fell in with 3 Marwarie travelers ; murdered them .
Parsing [sent. 5533 len. 17]: `` Near a village on the banks of the Taptee met 4 travelers and killed them .
Parsing [sent. 5534 len. 12]: `` Between Choupra and Dhoreea met a Marwarie ; murdered him .
Parsing [sent. 5535 len. 15]: `` At Dhoreea met 3 Marwaries ; took them two miles and murdered them .
Parsing [sent. 5536 len. 22]: `` Two miles further on , overtaken by three treasure-bearers ; took them two miles and murdered them in the jungle .
Parsing [sent. 5537 len. 15]: `` Came on to Khurgore Bateesa in Indore , divided spoil , and dispersed .
Parsing [sent. 5538 len. 12]: `` A total of 27 men murdered on one expedition . ''
Parsing [sent. 5539 len. 15]: Chotee -LRB- to save his neck -RRB- was informer , and furnished these facts .
Parsing [sent. 5540 len. 8]: Several things are noticeable about his resume .
Parsing [sent. 5541 len. 2]: 1 .
Parsing [sent. 5542 len. 70]: Business brevity ; 2 , absence of emotion ; 3 , smallness of the parties encountered by the 60 ; 4 , variety in character and quality of the game captured ; 5 , Hindoo and Mohammedan chiefs in business together for Bhowanee ; 6 , the sacred caste of the Brahmins not respected by either ; 7 , nor yet the character of that mendicant , that Byragee .
Parsing [sent. 5543 len. 78]: A beggar is a holy creature , and some of the gangs spared him on that account , no matter how slack business might be ; but other gangs slaughtered not only him , but even that sacredest of sacred creatures , the fakeer -- that repulsive skin-and-bone thing that goes around naked and mats his bushy hair with dust and dirt , and so beflours his lean body with ashes that he looks like a specter .
Parsing [sent. 5544 len. 15]: Sometimes a fakeer trusted a shade too far in the protection of his sacredness .
Parsing [sent. 5545 len. 26]: In the middle of a tally-sheet of Feringhea 's , who had been out with forty Thugs , I find a case of the kind .
Parsing [sent. 5546 len. 50]: After the killing of thirty-nine men and one woman , the fakeer appears on the scene : `` Approaching Doregow , met 3 pundits ; also a fakeer , mounted on a pony ; he was plastered over with sugar to collect flies , and was covered with them .
Parsing [sent. 5547 len. 11]: Drove off the fakeer , and killed the other three .
Parsing [sent. 5548 len. 28]: `` Leaving Doregow , the fakeer joined again , and went on in company to Raojana ; met 6 Khutries on their way from Bombay to Nagpore .
Parsing [sent. 5549 len. 22]: Drove off the fakeer with stones , and killed the 6 men in camp , and buried them in the grove .
Parsing [sent. 5550 len. 14]: `` Next day the fakeer joined again ; made him leave at Mana .
Parsing [sent. 5551 len. 23]: Beyond there , fell in with two Kahars and a sepoy , and came on towards the place selected for the murder .
Parsing [sent. 5552 len. 9]: When near it , the fakeer came again .
Parsing [sent. 5553 len. 31]: Losing all patience with him , gave Mithoo , one of the gang , 5 rupees -LRB- $ 2.50 -RRB- to murder him , and take the sin upon himself .
Parsing [sent. 5554 len. 9]: All four were strangled , including the fakeer .
Parsing [sent. 5555 len. 31]: Surprised to find among the fakeer 's effects 30 pounds of coral , 350 strings of small pearls , 15 strings of large pearls , and a gilt necklace . ''
Parsing [sent. 5556 len. 16]: It it curious , the little effect that time has upon a really interesting circumstance .
Parsing [sent. 5557 len. 108]: This one , so old , so long ago gone down into oblivion , reads with the same freshness and charm that attach to the news in the morning paper ; one 's spirits go up , then down , then up again , following the chances which the fakeer is running ; now you hope , now you despair , now you hope again ; and at last everything comes out right , and you feel a great wave of personal satisfaction go weltering through you , and without thinking , you put out your hand to pat Mithoo on the back , when -- puff !
Parsing [sent. 5558 len. 36]: the whole thing has vanished away , there is nothing there ; Mithoo and all the crowd have been dust and ashes and forgotten , oh , so many , many , many lagging years !
Parsing [sent. 5559 len. 37]: And then comes a sense of injury : you do n't know whether Mithoo got the swag , along with the sin , or had to divide up the swag and keep all the sin himself .
Parsing [sent. 5560 len. 10]: There is no literary art about a government report .
Parsing [sent. 5561 len. 11]: It stops a story right in the most interesting place .
Parsing [sent. 5562 len. 52]: These reports of Thug expeditions run along interminably in one monotonous tune : `` Met a sepoy -- killed him ; met 5 pundits -- killed them ; met 4 Rajpoots and a woman -- killed them '' -- and so on , till the statistics get to be pretty dry .
Parsing [sent. 5563 len. 15]: But this small trip of Feringhea 's Forty had some little variety about it .
Parsing [sent. 5564 len. 25]: Once they came across a man hiding in a grave -- a thief ; he had stolen 1,100 rupees from Dhunroj Seith of Parowtee .
Parsing [sent. 5565 len. 8]: They strangled him and took the money .
Parsing [sent. 5566 len. 7]: They had no patience with thieves .
Parsing [sent. 5567 len. 10]: They killed two treasure-bearers , and got 4,000 rupees .
Parsing [sent. 5568 len. 22]: They came across two bullocks `` laden with copper pice , '' and killed the four drivers and took the money .
Parsing [sent. 5569 len. 10]: There must have been half a ton of it .
Parsing [sent. 5570 len. 36]: I think it takes a double handful of pice to make an anna , and 16 annas to make a rupee ; and even in those days the rupee was worth only half a dollar .
Parsing [sent. 5571 len. 33]: Coming back over their tracks from Baroda , they had another picturesque stroke of luck : '' ` The Lohars of Oodeypore ' put a traveler in their charge for safety . ''
Parsing [sent. 5572 len. 34]: Dear , dear , across this abyssmal gulf of time we still see Feringhea 's lips uncover his teeth , and through the dim haze we catch the incandescent glimmer of his smile .
Parsing [sent. 5573 len. 18]: He accepted that trust , good man ; and so we know what went with the traveler .
Parsing [sent. 5574 len. 24]: Even Rajahs had no terrors for Feringhea ; he came across an elephant-driver belonging to the Rajah of Oodeypore and promptly strangled him .
Parsing [sent. 5575 len. 15]: `` A total of 100 men and 5 women murdered on this expedition . ''
Parsing [sent. 5576 len. 20]: Among the reports of expeditions we find mention of victims of almost every quality and estate : Native soldiers .
Parsing [sent. 5577 len. 2]: Fakeers .
Parsing [sent. 5578 len. 2]: Mendicants .
Parsing [sent. 5579 len. 3]: Holy-water carriers .
Parsing [sent. 5580 len. 2]: Carpenters .
Parsing [sent. 5581 len. 2]: Peddlers .
Parsing [sent. 5582 len. 2]: Tailors .
Parsing [sent. 5583 len. 2]: Blacksmiths .
Parsing [sent. 5584 len. 5]: Policemen -LRB- native -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 5585 len. 3]: Pastry cooks .
Parsing [sent. 5586 len. 2]: Grooms .
Parsing [sent. 5587 len. 3]: Mecca pilgrims .
Parsing [sent. 5588 len. 2]: Chuprassies .
Parsing [sent. 5589 len. 2]: Treasure-bearers .
Parsing [sent. 5590 len. 2]: Children .
Parsing [sent. 5591 len. 2]: Cowherds .
Parsing [sent. 5592 len. 2]: Gardeners .
Parsing [sent. 5593 len. 2]: Shopkeepers .
Parsing [sent. 5594 len. 2]: Palanquin-bearers .
Parsing [sent. 5595 len. 2]: Farmers .
Parsing [sent. 5596 len. 2]: Bullock-drivers .
Parsing [sent. 5597 len. 5]: Male servants seeking work .
Parsing [sent. 5598 len. 5]: Women servants seeking work .
Parsing [sent. 5599 len. 2]: Shepherds .
Parsing [sent. 5600 len. 2]: Archers .

Parsing [sent. 5602 len. 2]: Weavers .
Parsing [sent. 5603 len. 2]: Priests .
Parsing [sent. 5604 len. 2]: Bankers .
Parsing [sent. 5605 len. 2]: Boatmen .
Parsing [sent. 5606 len. 2]: Merchants .
Parsing [sent. 5607 len. 2]: Grass-cutters .
Parsing [sent. 5608 len. 26]: Also a prince 's cook ; and even the water-carrier of that sublime lord of lords and king of kings , the Governor-General of India !
Parsing [sent. 5609 len. 8]: How broad they were in their tastes !
Parsing [sent. 5610 len. 9]: They also murdered actors -- poor wandering barnstormers .
Parsing [sent. 5611 len. 73]: There are two instances recorded ; the first one by a gang of Thugs under a chief who soils a great name borne by a better man -- Kipling 's deathless `` Gungadin '' : `` After murdering 4 sepoys , going on toward Indore , met 4 strolling players , and persuaded them to come with us , on the pretense that we would see their performance at the next stage .
Parsing [sent. 5612 len. 9]: Murdered them at a temple near Bhopal . ''
Parsing [sent. 5613 len. 11]: Second instance : `` At Deohuttee , joined by comedians .
Parsing [sent. 5614 len. 8]: Murdered them eastward of that place . ''
Parsing [sent. 5615 len. 9]: But this gang was a particularly bad crew .
Parsing [sent. 5616 len. 11]: On that expedition they murdered a fakeer and twelve beggars .
Parsing [sent. 5617 len. 69]: And yet Bhowanee protected them ; for once when they were strangling a man in a wood when a crowd was going by close at hand and the noose slipped and the man screamed , Bhowanee made a camel burst out at the same moment with a roar that drowned the scream ; and before the man could repeat it the breath was choked out of his body .
Parsing [sent. 5618 len. 45]: The cow is so sacred in India that to kill her keeper is an awful sacrilege , and even the Thugs recognized this ; yet now and then the lust for blood was too strong , and so they did kill a few cow-keepers .
Parsing [sent. 5619 len. 32]: In one of these instances the witness who killed the cowherd said , `` In Thuggee this is strictly forbidden , and is an act from which no good can come .
Parsing [sent. 5620 len. 11]: I was ill of a fever for ten days afterward .
Parsing [sent. 5621 len. 16]: I do believe that evil will follow the murder of a man with a cow .
Parsing [sent. 5622 len. 11]: If there be no cow it does not signify . ''
Parsing [sent. 5623 len. 16]: Another Thug said he held the cowherd 's feet while this witness did the strangling .
Parsing [sent. 5624 len. 35]: He felt no concern , `` because the bad fortune of such a deed is upon the strangler and not upon the assistants ; even if there should be a hundred of them . ''
Parsing [sent. 5625 len. 14]: There were thousands of Thugs roving over India constantly , during many generations .
Parsing [sent. 5626 len. 19]: They made Thuggee a hereditary vocation and taught it to their sons and to their son 's sons .
Parsing [sent. 5627 len. 21]: Boys were in full membership as early as 16 years of age ; veterans were still at work at 70 .
Parsing [sent. 5628 len. 10]: What was the fascination , what was the impulse ?
Parsing [sent. 5629 len. 27]: Apparently , it was partly piety , largely gain , and there is reason to suspect that the sport afforded was the chiefest fascination of all .
Parsing [sent. 5630 len. 30]: Meadows Taylor makes a Thug in one of his books claim that the pleasure of killing men was the white man 's beast-hunting instinct enlarged , refined , ennobled .
Parsing [sent. 5631 len. 9]: I will quote the passage : CHAPTER XLVII .
Parsing [sent. 5632 len. 30]: Simple rules for saving money : To save half , when you are fired by an eager impulse to contribute to a charity , wait , and count forty .
Parsing [sent. 5633 len. 7]: To save three-quarters , count sixty .
Parsing [sent. 5634 len. 8]: To save it all , count sixty-five .
Parsing [sent. 5635 len. 9]: -- Pudd ` nhead Wilson 's New Calendar .
Parsing [sent. 5636 len. 16]: The Thug said : `` How many of you English are passionately devoted to sporting !
Parsing [sent. 5637 len. 10]: Your days and months are passed in its excitement .
Parsing [sent. 5638 len. 28]: A tiger , a panther , a buffalo or a hog rouses your utmost energies for its destruction -- you even risk your lives in its pursuit .
Parsing [sent. 5639 len. 10]: How much higher game is a Thug 's ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5640 len. 14]: That must really be the secret of the rise and development of Thuggee .
Parsing [sent. 5641 len. 5]: The joy of killing !
Parsing [sent. 5642 len. 17]: the joy of seeing killing done -- these are traits of the human race at large .
Parsing [sent. 5643 len. 72]: We white people are merely modified Thugs ; Thugs fretting under the restraints of a not very thick skin of civilization ; Thugs who long ago enjoyed the slaughter of the Roman arena , and later the burning of doubtful Christians by authentic Christians in the public squares , and who now , with the Thugs of Spain and Nimes , flock to enjoy the blood and misery of the bullring .
Parsing [sent. 5644 len. 44]: We have no tourists of either sex or any religion who are able to resist the delights of the bull-ring when opportunity offers ; and we are gentle Thugs in the hunting-season , and love to chase a tame rabbit and kill it .
Parsing [sent. 5645 len. 41]: Still , we have made some progress-microscopic , and in truth scarcely worth mentioning , and certainly nothing to be proud of -- still , it is progress : we no longer take pleasure in slaughtering or burning helpless men .
Parsing [sent. 5646 len. 46]: We have reached a little altitude where we may look down upon the Indian Thugs with a complacent shudder ; and we may even hope for a day , many centuries hence , when our posterity will look down upon us in the same way .
Parsing [sent. 5647 len. 144]: There are many indications that the Thug often hunted men for the mere sport of it ; that the fright and pain of the quarry were no more to him than are the fright and pain of the rabbit or the stag to us ; and that he was no more ashamed of beguiling his game with deceits and abusing its trust than are we when we have imitated a wild animal 's call and shot it when it honored us with its confidence and came to see what we wanted : `` Madara , son of Nihal , and I , Ramzam , set out from Kotdee in the cold weather and followed the high road for about twenty days in search of travelers , until we came to Selempore , where we met a very old man going to the east .
Parsing [sent. 5648 len. 53]: We won his confidence in this manner : he carried a load which was too heavy for his old age ; I said to him , ` You are an old man , I will aid you in carrying your load , as you are from my part of the country . '
Parsing [sent. 5649 len. 13]: He said , ` Very well , take me with you . '
Parsing [sent. 5650 len. 15]: So we took him with us to Selempore , where we slept that night .
Parsing [sent. 5651 len. 30]: We woke him next morning before dawn and set out , and at the distance of three miles we seated him to rest while it was still very dark .
Parsing [sent. 5652 len. 10]: Madara was ready behind him , and strangled him .
Parsing [sent. 5653 len. 6]: He never spoke a word .
Parsing [sent. 5654 len. 11]: He was about 60 or 70 years of age . ''
Parsing [sent. 5655 len. 32]: Another gang fell in with a couple of barbers and persuaded them to come along in their company by promising them the job of shaving the whole crew -- 30 Thugs .
Parsing [sent. 5656 len. 20]: At the place appointed for the murder 15 got shaved , and actually paid the barbers for their work .
Parsing [sent. 5657 len. 9]: Then killed them and took back the money .
Parsing [sent. 5658 len. 30]: A gang of forty-two Thugs came across two Brahmins and a shopkeeper on the road , beguiled them into a grove and got up a concert for their entertainment .
Parsing [sent. 5659 len. 29]: While these poor fellows were listening to the music the stranglers were standing behind them ; and at the proper moment for dramatic effect they applied the noose .
Parsing [sent. 5660 len. 29]: The most devoted fisherman must have a bite at least as often as once a week or his passion will cool and he will put up his tackle .
Parsing [sent. 5661 len. 19]: The tiger-sportsman must find a tiger at least once a fortnight or he will get tired and quit .
Parsing [sent. 5662 len. 35]: The elephant-hunter 's enthusiasm will waste away little by little , and his zeal will perish at last if he plod around a month without finding a member of that noble family to assassinate .
Parsing [sent. 5663 len. 25]: But when the lust in the hunter 's heart is for the noblest of all quarries , man , how different is the case !
Parsing [sent. 5664 len. 20]: and how watery and poor is the zeal and how childish the endurance of those other hunters by comparison .
Parsing [sent. 5665 len. 46]: Then , neither hunger , nor thirst , nor fatigue , nor deferred hope , nor monotonous disappointment , nor leaden-footed lapse of time can conquer the hunter 's patience or weaken the joy of his quest or cool the splendid rage of his desire .
Parsing [sent. 5666 len. 42]: Of all the hunting-passions that burn in the breast of man , there is none that can lift him superior to discouragements like these but the one -- the royal sport , the supreme sport , whose quarry is his brother .
Parsing [sent. 5667 len. 19]: By comparison , tiger-hunting is a colorless poor thing , for all it has been so bragged about .
Parsing [sent. 5668 len. 55]: Why , the Thug was content to tramp patiently along , afoot , in the wasting heat of India , week after week , at an average of nine or ten miles a day , if he might but hope to find game some time or other and refresh his longing soul with blood .
Parsing [sent. 5669 len. 58]: Here is an instance : `` I -LRB- Ramzam -RRB- and Hyder set out , for the purpose of strangling travelers , from Guddapore , and proceeded via the Fort of Julalabad , Newulgunge , Bangermow , on the banks of the Ganges -LRB- upwards of 100 miles -RRB- , from whence we returned by another route .
Parsing [sent. 5670 len. 4]: Still no travelers !
Parsing [sent. 5671 len. 45]: till we reached Bowaneegunge , where we fell in with a traveler , a boatman ; we inveigled him and about two miles east of there Hyder strangled him as he stood -- for he was troubled and afraid , and would not sit .
Parsing [sent. 5672 len. 71]: We then made a long journey -LRB- about 130 miles -RRB- and reached Hussunpore Bundwa , where at the tank we fell in with a traveler -- he slept there that night ; next morning we followed him and tried to win his confidence ; at the distance of two miles we endeavored to induce him to sit down -- but he would not , having become aware of us .
Parsing [sent. 5673 len. 36]: I attempted to strangle him as he walked along , but did not succeed ; both of us then fell upon him , he made a great outcry , ` They are murdering me ! '
Parsing [sent. 5674 len. 13]: at length we strangled him and flung his body into a well .
Parsing [sent. 5675 len. 19]: After this we returned to our homes , having been out a month and traveled about 260 miles .
Parsing [sent. 5676 len. 11]: A total of two men murdered on the expedition . ''
Parsing [sent. 5677 len. 76]: And here is another case-related by the terrible Futty Khan , a man with a tremendous record , to be re-mentioned by and by : `` I , with three others , traveled for about 45 days a distance of about 200 miles in search of victims along the highway to Bundwa and returned by Davodpore -LRB- another 200 miles -RRB- during which journey we had only one murder , which happened in this manner .
Parsing [sent. 5678 len. 18]: Four miles to the east of Noubustaghat we fell in with a traveler , an old man .
Parsing [sent. 5679 len. 61]: I , with Koshal and Hyder , inveigled him and accompanied him that day within 3 miles of Rampoor , where , after dark , in a lonely place , we got him to sit down and rest ; and while I kept him in talk , seated before him , Hyder behind strangled him : he made no resistance .
Parsing [sent. 5680 len. 21]: Koshal stabbed him under the arms and in the throat , and we flung the body into a running stream .
Parsing [sent. 5681 len. 16]: We got about 4 or 5 rupees each -LRB- $ 2 or $ 2.50 -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 5682 len. 5]: We then proceeded homewards .
Parsing [sent. 5683 len. 11]: A total of one man murdered on this expedition . ''
Parsing [sent. 5684 len. 2]: There .
Parsing [sent. 5685 len. 20]: They tramped 400 miles , were gone about three months , and harvested two dollars and a half apiece .
Parsing [sent. 5686 len. 10]: But the mere pleasure of the hunt was sufficient .
Parsing [sent. 5687 len. 5]: That was pay enough .
Parsing [sent. 5688 len. 5]: They did no grumbling .
Parsing [sent. 5689 len. 30]: Every now and then in this big book one comes across that pathetic remark : `` we tried to get him to sit down but he would not . ''
Parsing [sent. 5690 len. 6]: It tells the whole story .
Parsing [sent. 5691 len. 55]: Some accident had awakened the suspicion in him that these smooth friends who had been petting and coddling him and making him feel so safe and so fortunate after his forlorn and lonely wanderings were the dreaded Thugs ; and now their ghastly invitation to `` sit and rest '' had confirmed its truth .
Parsing [sent. 5692 len. 28]: He knew there was no help for him , and that he was looking his last upon earthly things , but `` he would not sit . ''
Parsing [sent. 5693 len. 13]: No , not that -- it was too awful to think of !
Parsing [sent. 5694 len. 36]: There are a number of instances which indicate that when a man had once tasted the regal joys of man-hunting he could not be content with the dull monotony of a crimeless life after ward .
Parsing [sent. 5695 len. 42]: Example , from a Thug 's testimony : `` We passed through to Kurnaul , where we found a former Thug named Junooa , an old comrade of ours , who had turned religious mendicant and become a disciple and holy .
Parsing [sent. 5696 len. 18]: He came to us in the serai and weeping with joy returned to his old trade . ''
Parsing [sent. 5697 len. 14]: Neither wealth nor honors nor dignities could satisfy a reformed Thug for long .
Parsing [sent. 5698 len. 28]: He would throw them all away , someday , and go back to the lurid pleasures of hunting men , and being hunted himself by the British .
Parsing [sent. 5699 len. 17]: Ramzam was taken into a great native grandee 's service and given authority over five villages .
Parsing [sent. 5700 len. 21]: `` My authority extended over these people to summons them to my presence , to make them stand or sit .
Parsing [sent. 5701 len. 23]: I dressed well , rode my pony , and had two sepoys , a scribe and a village guard to attend me .
Parsing [sent. 5702 len. 23]: During three years I used to pay each village a monthly visit , and no one suspected that I was a Thug !
Parsing [sent. 5703 len. 28]: The chief man used to wait on me to transact business , and as I passed along , old and young made their salaam to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 5704 len. 39]: And yet during that very three years he got leave of absence `` to attend a wedding , '' and instead went off on a Thugging lark with six other Thugs and hunted the highway for fifteen days !
Parsing [sent. 5705 len. 5]: -- with satisfactory results .
Parsing [sent. 5706 len. 10]: Afterwards he held a great office under a Rajah .
Parsing [sent. 5707 len. 28]: There he had ten miles of country under his command and a military guard of fifteen men , with authority to call out 2,000 more upon occasion .
Parsing [sent. 5708 len. 21]: But the British got on his track , and they crowded him so that he had to give himself up .
Parsing [sent. 5709 len. 64]: See what a figure he was when he was gotten up for style and had all his things on : `` I was fully armed -- a sword , shield , pistols , a matchlock musket and a flint gun , for I was fond of being thus arrayed , and when so armed feared not though forty men stood before me . ''
Parsing [sent. 5710 len. 11]: He gave himself up and proudly proclaimed himself a Thug .
Parsing [sent. 5711 len. 24]: Then by request he agreed to betray his friend and pal , Buhram , a Thug with the most tremendous record in India .
Parsing [sent. 5712 len. 18]: `` I went to the house where Buhram slept -LRB- often has he led our gangs ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 5713 len. 15]: I woke him , he knew me well , and came outside to me .
Parsing [sent. 5714 len. 35]: It was a cold night , so under pretence of warming myself , but in reality to have light for his seizure by the guards , I lighted some straw and made a blaze .
Parsing [sent. 5715 len. 6]: We were warming our hands .
Parsing [sent. 5716 len. 6]: The guards drew around us .
Parsing [sent. 5717 len. 23]: I said to them , ` This is Buhram , ' and he was seized just as a cat seizes a mouse .
Parsing [sent. 5718 len. 10]: Then Buhram said , ' I am a Thug !
Parsing [sent. 5719 len. 21]: my father was a Thug , my grandfather was a Thug , and I have thugged with many ! ' ''
Parsing [sent. 5720 len. 19]: So spoke the mighty hunter , the mightiest of the mighty , the Gordon Cumming of his day .
Parsing [sent. 5721 len. 7]: Not much regret noticeable in it .
Parsing [sent. 5722 len. 34]: -- -LSB- `` Having planted a bullet in the shoulder-bone of an elephant , and caused the agonized creature to lean for support against a tree , I proceeded to brew some coffee .
Parsing [sent. 5723 len. 44]: Having refreshed myself , taking observations of the elephant 's spasms and writhings between the sips , I resolved to make experiments on vulnerable points , and , approaching very near , I fired several bullets at different parts of his enormous skull .
Parsing [sent. 5724 len. 30]: He only acknowledged the shots by a salaam-like movement of his trunk , with the point of which he gently touched the wounds with a striking and peculiar action .
Parsing [sent. 5725 len. 48]: Surprised and shocked to find that I was only prolonging the suffering of the noble beast , which bore its trials with such dignified composure , I resolved to finish the proceeding with all possible despatch , and accordingly opened fire upon him from the left side .
Parsing [sent. 5726 len. 36]: Aiming at the shoulder , I fired six shots with the two-grooved rifle , which must have eventually proved mortal , after which I fired six shots at the same part with the Dutch six-founder .
Parsing [sent. 5727 len. 31]: Large tears now trickled down from his eyes , which he slowly shut and opened , his colossal frame shivered convulsively , and falling on his side he expired . ''
Parsing [sent. 5728 len. 5]: -- Gordon Cumming . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 5729 len. 13]: So many many times this Official Report leaves one 's curiosity unsatisfied .
Parsing [sent. 5730 len. 41]: For instance , here is a little paragraph out of the record of a certain band of 193 Thugs , which has that defect : `` Fell in with Lall Sing Subahdar and his family , consisting of nine persons .
Parsing [sent. 5731 len. 30]: Traveled with them two days , and the third put them all to death except the two children , little boys of one and a half years old . ''
Parsing [sent. 5732 len. 4]: There it stops .
Parsing [sent. 5733 len. 10]: What did they do with those poor little fellows ?
Parsing [sent. 5734 len. 6]: What was their subsequent history ?
Parsing [sent. 5735 len. 9]: Did they purpose training them up as Thugs ?
Parsing [sent. 5736 len. 18]: How could they take care of such little creatures on a march which stretched over several months ?
Parsing [sent. 5737 len. 14]: No one seems to have cared to ask any questions about the babies .
Parsing [sent. 5738 len. 7]: But I do wish I knew .
Parsing [sent. 5739 len. 38]: One would be apt to imagine that the Thugs were utterly callous , utterly destitute of human feelings , heartless toward their own families as well as toward other people 's ; but this was not so .
Parsing [sent. 5740 len. 14]: Like all other Indians , they had a passionate love for their kin .
Parsing [sent. 5741 len. 29]: A shrewd British officer who knew the Indian character , took that characteristic into account in laying his plans for the capture of Eugene Sue 's famous Feringhea .
Parsing [sent. 5742 len. 27]: He found out Feringhea 's hiding-place , and sent a guard by night to seize him , but the squad was awkward and he got away .
Parsing [sent. 5743 len. 61]: However , they got the rest of the family -- the mother , wife , child , and brother -- and brought them to the officer , at Jubbulpore ; the officer did not fret , but bided his time : `` I knew Feringhea would not go far while links so dear to him were in my hands . ''
Parsing [sent. 5744 len. 4]: He was right .
Parsing [sent. 5745 len. 22]: Feringhea knew all the danger he was running by staying in the neighborhood , still he could not tear himself away .
Parsing [sent. 5746 len. 43]: The officer found that he divided his time between five villages where he had relatives and friends who could get news for him from his family in Jubbulpore jail ; and that he never slept two consecutive nights in the same village .
Parsing [sent. 5747 len. 30]: The officer traced out his several haunts , then pounced upon all the five villages on the one night and at the same hour , and got his man .
Parsing [sent. 5748 len. 6]: Another example of family affection .
Parsing [sent. 5749 len. 40]: A little while previously to the capture of Feringhea 's family , the British officer had captured Feringhea 's foster-brother , leader of a gang of ten , and had tried the eleven and condemned them to be hanged .
Parsing [sent. 5750 len. 18]: Feringhea 's captured family arrived at the jail the day before the execution was to take place .
Parsing [sent. 5751 len. 18]: The foster-brother , Jhurhoo , entreated to be allowed to see the aged mother and the others .
Parsing [sent. 5752 len. 39]: The prayer was granted , and this is what took place -- it is the British officer who speaks : `` In the morning , just before going to the scaffold , the interview took place before me .
Parsing [sent. 5753 len. 44]: He fell at the old woman 's feet and begged that she would relieve him from the obligations of the milk with which she had nourished him from infancy , as he was about to die before he could fulfill any of them .
Parsing [sent. 5754 len. 29]: She placed her hands on his head , and he knelt , and she said she forgave him all , and bid him die like a man . ''
Parsing [sent. 5755 len. 28]: If a capable artist should make a picture of it , it would be full of dignity and solemnity and pathos ; and it could touch you .
Parsing [sent. 5756 len. 12]: You would imagine it to be anything but what it was .
Parsing [sent. 5757 len. 34]: There is reverence there , and tenderness , and gratefulness , and compassion , and resignation , and fortitude , and self-respect -- and no sense of disgrace , no thought of dishonor .
Parsing [sent. 5758 len. 22]: Everything is there that goes to make a noble parting , and give it a moving grace and beauty and dignity .
Parsing [sent. 5759 len. 17]: And yet one of these people is a Thug and the other a mother of Thugs !
Parsing [sent. 5760 len. 13]: The incongruities of our human nature seem to reach their limit here .
Parsing [sent. 5761 len. 15]: I wish to make note of one curious thing while I think of it .
Parsing [sent. 5762 len. 30]: One of the very commonest remarks to be found in this bewildering array of Thug confessions is this : `` Strangled him and threw him in a well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5763 len. 21]: In one case they threw sixteen into a well -- and they had thrown others in the same well before .
Parsing [sent. 5764 len. 10]: It makes a body thirsty to read about it .
Parsing [sent. 5765 len. 8]: And there is another very curious thing .
Parsing [sent. 5766 len. 8]: The bands of Thugs had private graveyards .
Parsing [sent. 5767 len. 17]: They did not like to kill and bury at random , here and there and everywhere .
Parsing [sent. 5768 len. 28]: They preferred to wait , and toll the victims along , and get to one of their regular burying-places -LRB- ` bheels ' -RRB- if they could .
Parsing [sent. 5769 len. 35]: In the little kingdom of Oude , which was about half as big as Ireland and about as big as the State of Maine , they had two hundred and seventy-four ` bheels ' .
Parsing [sent. 5770 len. 41]: They were scattered along fourteen hundred miles of road , at an average of only five miles apart , and the British government traced out and located each and every one of them and set them down on the map .
Parsing [sent. 5771 len. 21]: The Oude bands seldom went out of their own country , but they did a thriving business within its borders .
Parsing [sent. 5772 len. 10]: So did outside bands who came in and helped .
Parsing [sent. 5773 len. 14]: Some of the Thug leaders of Oude were noted for their successful careers .
Parsing [sent. 5774 len. 53]: Each of four of them confessed to above 300 murders ; another to nearly 400 ; our friend Ramzam to 604 -- he is the one who got leave of absence to attend a wedding and went thugging instead ; and he is also the one who betrayed Buhram to the British .
Parsing [sent. 5775 len. 15]: But the biggest records of all were the murder-lists of Futty Khan and Buhram .
Parsing [sent. 5776 len. 31]: Futty Khan 's number is smaller than Ramzam 's , but he is placed at the head because his average is the best in Oude-Thug history per year of service .
Parsing [sent. 5777 len. 23]: His slaughter was 508 men in twenty years , and he was still a young man when the British stopped his industry .
Parsing [sent. 5778 len. 14]: Buhram 's list was 931 murders , but it took him forty years .
Parsing [sent. 5779 len. 40]: His average was one man and nearly all of another man per month for forty years , but Futty Khan 's average was two men and a little of another man per month during his twenty years of usefulness .
Parsing [sent. 5780 len. 14]: There is one very striking thing which I wish to call attention to .
Parsing [sent. 5781 len. 55]: You have surmised from the listed callings followed by the victims of the Thugs that nobody could travel the Indian roads unprotected and live to get through ; that the Thugs respected no quality , no vocation , no religion , nobody ; that they killed every unarmed man that came in their way .
Parsing [sent. 5782 len. 9]: That is wholly true -- with one reservation .
Parsing [sent. 5783 len. 38]: In all the long file of Thug confessions an English traveler is mentioned but once -- and this is what the Thug says of the circumstance : `` He was on his way from Mhow to Bombay .
Parsing [sent. 5784 len. 5]: We studiously avoided him .
Parsing [sent. 5785 len. 24]: He proceeded next morning with a number of travelers who had sought his protection , and they took the road to Baroda . ''
Parsing [sent. 5786 len. 51]: We do not know who he was ; he flits across the page of this rusty old book and disappears in the obscurity beyond ; but he is an impressive figure , moving through that valley of death serene and unafraid , clothed in the might of the English name .
Parsing [sent. 5787 len. 31]: We have now followed the big official book through , and we understand what Thuggee was , what a bloody terror it was , what a desolating scourge it was .
Parsing [sent. 5788 len. 100]: In 1830 the English found this cancerous organization imbedded in the vitals of the empire , doing its devastating work in secrecy , and assisted , protected , sheltered , and hidden by innumerable confederates -- big and little native chiefs , customs officers , village officials , and native police , all ready to lie for it , and the mass of the people , through fear , persistently pretending to know nothing about its doings ; and this condition of things had existed for generations , and was formidable with the sanctions of age and old custom .
Parsing [sent. 5789 len. 31]: If ever there was an unpromising task , if ever there was a hopeless task in the world , surely it was offered here -- the task of conquering Thuggee .
Parsing [sent. 5790 len. 27]: But that little handful of English officials in India set their sturdy and confident grip upon it , and ripped it out , root and branch !
Parsing [sent. 5791 len. 52]: How modest do Captain Vallancey 's words sound now , when we read them again , knowing what we know : `` The day that sees this far-spread evil completely eradicated from India , and known only in name , will greatly tend to immortalize British rule in the East . ''
Parsing [sent. 5792 len. 18]: It would be hard to word a claim more modestly than that for this most noble work .
Parsing [sent. 5793 len. 3]: CHAPTER XLVIII .
Parsing [sent. 5794 len. 25]: Grief can take care of itself ; but to get the full value of a joy you must have somebody to divide it with .
Parsing [sent. 5795 len. 9]: -- Pudd ` nhead Wilson 's New Calendar .
Parsing [sent. 5796 len. 10]: We left Bombay for Allahabad by a night train .
Parsing [sent. 5797 len. 18]: It is the custom of the country to avoid day travel when it can conveniently be done .
Parsing [sent. 5798 len. 46]: But there is one trouble : while you can seemingly `` secure '' the two lower berths by making early application , there is no ticket as witness of it , and no other producible evidence in case your proprietorship shall chance to be challenged .
Parsing [sent. 5799 len. 23]: The word `` engaged '' appears on the window , but it does n't state who the compartment is engaged , for .
Parsing [sent. 5800 len. 78]: If your Satan and your Barney arrive before somebody else 's servants , and spread the bedding on the two sofas and then stand guard till you come , all will be well ; but if they step aside on an errand , they may find the beds promoted to the two shelves , and somebody else 's demons standing guard over their master 's beds , which in the meantime have been spread upon your sofas .
Parsing [sent. 5801 len. 18]: You do not pay anything extra for your sleeping place ; that is where the trouble lies .
Parsing [sent. 5802 len. 51]: If you buy a fare-ticket and fail to use it , there is room thus made available for someone else ; but if the place were secured to you it would remain vacant , and yet your ticket would secure you another place when you were presently ready to travel .
Parsing [sent. 5803 len. 27]: However , no explanation of such a system can make it seem quite rational to a person who has been used to a more rational system .
Parsing [sent. 5804 len. 34]: If our people had the arranging of it , we should charge extra for securing the place , and then the road would suffer no loss if the purchaser did not occupy it .
Parsing [sent. 5805 len. 12]: The present system encourages good manners -- and also discourages them .
Parsing [sent. 5806 len. 46]: If a young girl has a lower berth and an elderly lady comes in , it is usual for the girl to offer her place to this late comer ; and it is usual for the late comer to thank her courteously and take it .
Parsing [sent. 5807 len. 7]: But the thing happens differently sometimes .
Parsing [sent. 5808 len. 22]: When we were ready to leave Bombay my daughter 's satchels were holding possession of her berth -- a lower one .
Parsing [sent. 5809 len. 23]: At the last moment , a middle-aged American lady swarmed into the compartment , followed by native porters laden with her baggage .
Parsing [sent. 5810 len. 19]: She was growling and snarling and scolding , and trying to make herself phenomenally disagreeable ; and succeeding .
Parsing [sent. 5811 len. 21]: Without a word , she hoisted the satchels into the hanging shelf , and took possession of that lower berth .
Parsing [sent. 5812 len. 51]: On one of our trips Mr. Smythe and I got out at a station to walk up and down , and when we came back Smythe 's bed was in the hanging shelf and an English cavalry officer was in bed on the sofa which he had lately been occupying .
Parsing [sent. 5813 len. 36]: It was mean to be glad about it , but it is the way we are made ; I could not have been gladder if it had been my enemy that had suffered this misfortune .
Parsing [sent. 5814 len. 17]: We all like to see people in trouble , if it does n't cost us anything .
Parsing [sent. 5815 len. 24]: I was so happy over Mr. Smythe 's chagrin that I could n't go to sleep for thinking of it and enjoying it .
Parsing [sent. 5816 len. 27]: I knew he supposed the officer had committed the robbery himself , whereas without a doubt the officer 's servant had done it without his knowledge .
Parsing [sent. 5817 len. 23]: Mr. Smythe kept this incident warm in his heart , and longed for a chance to get even with somebody for it .
Parsing [sent. 5818 len. 9]: Sometime afterward the opportunity came , in Calcutta .
Parsing [sent. 5819 len. 10]: We were leaving on a 24-hour journey to Darjeeling .
Parsing [sent. 5820 len. 40]: Mr. Barclay , the general superintendent , has made special provision for our accommodation , Mr. Smythe said ; so there was no need to hurry about getting to the train ; consequently , we were a little late .
Parsing [sent. 5821 len. 20]: When we arrived , the usual immense turmoil and confusion of a great Indian station were in full blast .
Parsing [sent. 5822 len. 34]: It was an immoderately long train , for all the natives of India were going by it somewhither , and the native officials were being pestered to frenzy by belated and anxious people .
Parsing [sent. 5823 len. 20]: They did n't know where our car was , and could n't remember having received any orders about it .
Parsing [sent. 5824 len. 23]: It was a deep disappointment ; moreover , it looked as if our half of our party would be left behind altogether .
Parsing [sent. 5825 len. 30]: Then Satan came running and said he had found a compartment with one shelf and one sofa unoccupied , and had made our beds and had stowed our baggage .
Parsing [sent. 5826 len. 61]: We rushed to the place , and just as the train was ready to pull out and the porters were slamming the doors to , all down the line , an officer of the Indian Civil Service , a good friend of ours , put his head in and said : -- `` I have been hunting for you everywhere .
Parsing [sent. 5827 len. 6]: What are you doing here ?
Parsing [sent. 5828 len. 14]: Do n't you know -- '' The train started before he could finish .
Parsing [sent. 5829 len. 7]: Mr. Smythe 's opportunity was come .
Parsing [sent. 5830 len. 30]: His bedding , on the shelf , at once changed places with the bedding -- a stranger 's -- that was occupying the sofa that was opposite to mine .
Parsing [sent. 5831 len. 18]: About ten o'clock we stopped somewhere , and a large Englishman of official military bearing stepped in .
Parsing [sent. 5832 len. 6]: We pretended to be asleep .
Parsing [sent. 5833 len. 19]: The lamps were covered , but there was light enough for us to note his look of surprise .
Parsing [sent. 5834 len. 21]: He stood there , grand and fine , peering down at Smythe , and wondering in silence at the situation .
Parsing [sent. 5835 len. 11]: After a bit he said : -- `` Well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5836 len. 5]: And that was all .
Parsing [sent. 5837 len. 5]: But that was enough .
Parsing [sent. 5838 len. 6]: It was easy to understand .
Parsing [sent. 5839 len. 8]: It meant : `` This is extraordinary .
Parsing [sent. 5840 len. 4]: This is high-handed .
Parsing [sent. 5841 len. 11]: I have n't had an experience like this before . ''
Parsing [sent. 5842 len. 29]: He sat down on his baggage , and for twenty minutes we watched him through our eyelashes , rocking and swaying there to the motion of the train .
Parsing [sent. 5843 len. 30]: Then we came to a station , and he got up and went out , muttering : `` I must find a lower berth , or wait over . ''
Parsing [sent. 5844 len. 10]: His servant came presently and carried away his things .
Parsing [sent. 5845 len. 15]: Mr. Smythe 's sore place was healed , his hunger for revenge was satisfied .
Parsing [sent. 5846 len. 26]: But he could n't sleep , and neither could I ; for this was a venerable old car , and nothing about it was taut .
Parsing [sent. 5847 len. 15]: The closet door slammed all night , and defied every fastening we could invent .
Parsing [sent. 5848 len. 53]: We got up very much jaded , at dawn , and stepped out at a way station ; and , while we were taking a cup of coffee , that Englishman ranged up alongside , and somebody said to him : `` So you did n't stop off , after all ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5849 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 5850 len. 15]: The guard found a place for me that had been engaged and not occupied .
Parsing [sent. 5851 len. 15]: I had a whole saloon car all to myself -- oh , quite palatial !
Parsing [sent. 5852 len. 10]: I never had such luck in my life . ''
Parsing [sent. 5853 len. 8]: That was our car , you see .
Parsing [sent. 5854 len. 13]: We moved into it , straight off , the family and all .
Parsing [sent. 5855 len. 13]: But I asked the English gentleman to remain , and he did .
Parsing [sent. 5856 len. 37]: A pleasant man , an infantry colonel ; and does n't know , yet , that Smythe robbed him of his berth , but thinks it was done by Smythe 's servant without Smythe 's knowledge .
Parsing [sent. 5857 len. 8]: He was assisted in gathering this impression .
Parsing [sent. 5858 len. 9]: The Indian trains are manned by natives exclusively .
Parsing [sent. 5859 len. 24]: The Indian stations except very large and important ones -- are manned entirely by natives , and so are the posts and telegraphs .
Parsing [sent. 5860 len. 10]: The rank and file of the police are natives .
Parsing [sent. 5861 len. 8]: All these people are pleasant and accommodating .
Parsing [sent. 5862 len. 64]: One day I left an express train to lounge about in that perennially ravishing show , the ebb and flow and whirl of gaudy natives , that is always surging up and down the spacious platform of a great Indian station ; and I lost myself in the ecstasy of it , and when I turned , the train was moving swiftly away .
Parsing [sent. 5863 len. 29]: I was going to sit down and wait for another train , as I would have done at home ; I had no thought of any other course .
Parsing [sent. 5864 len. 33]: But a native official , who had a green flag in his hand , saw me , and said politely : `` Do n't you belong in the train , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5865 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 5866 len. 3]: I said .
Parsing [sent. 5867 len. 11]: He waved his flag , and the train came back !
Parsing [sent. 5868 len. 18]: And he put me aboard with as much ceremony as if I had been the General Superintendent .
Parsing [sent. 5869 len. 8]: They are kindly people , the natives .
Parsing [sent. 5870 len. 47]: The face and the bearing that indicate a surly spirit and a bad heart seemed to me to be so rare among Indians -- so nearly non-existent , in fact -- that I sometimes wondered if Thuggee was n't a dream , and not a reality .
Parsing [sent. 5871 len. 19]: The bad hearts are there , but I believe that they are in a small , poor minority .
Parsing [sent. 5872 len. 23]: One thing is sure : They are much the most interesting people in the world -- and the nearest to being incomprehensible .
Parsing [sent. 5873 len. 10]: At any rate , the hardest to account for .
Parsing [sent. 5874 len. 34]: Their character and their history , their customs and their religion , confront you with riddles at every turn-riddles which are a trifle more perplexing after they are explained than they were before .
Parsing [sent. 5875 len. 42]: You can get the facts of a custom -- like caste , and Suttee , and Thuggee , and so on -- and with the facts a theory which tries to explain , but never quite does it to your satisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 5876 len. 18]: You can never quite understand how so strange a thing could have been born , nor why .
Parsing [sent. 5877 len. 6]: For instance -- the Suttee .
Parsing [sent. 5878 len. 91]: This is the explanation of it : A woman who throws away her life when her husband dies is instantly joined to him again , and is forever afterward happy with him in heaven ; her family will build a little monument to her , or a temple , and will hold her in honor , and , indeed , worship her memory always ; they will themselves be held in honor by the public ; the woman 's self-sacrifice has conferred a noble and lasting distinction upon her posterity .
Parsing [sent. 5879 len. 51]: And , besides , see what she has escaped : If she had elected to live , she would be a disgraced person ; she could not remarry ; her family would despise her and disown her ; she would be a friendless outcast , and miserable all her days .
Parsing [sent. 5880 len. 14]: Very well , you say , but the explanation is not complete yet .
Parsing [sent. 5881 len. 12]: How did people come to drift into such a strange custom ?
Parsing [sent. 5882 len. 8]: What was the origin of the idea ?
Parsing [sent. 5883 len. 18]: `` Well , nobody knows ; it was probably a revelation sent down by the gods . ''
Parsing [sent. 5884 len. 21]: One more thing : Why was such a cruel death chosen -- why would n't a gentle one have answered ?
Parsing [sent. 5885 len. 13]: `` Nobody knows ; maybe that was a revelation , too . ''
Parsing [sent. 5886 len. 8]: No -- you can never understand it .
Parsing [sent. 5887 len. 5]: It all seems impossible .
Parsing [sent. 5888 len. 26]: You resolve to believe that a widow never burnt herself willingly , but went to her death because she was afraid to defy public opinion .
Parsing [sent. 5889 len. 10]: But you are not able to keep that position .
Parsing [sent. 5890 len. 6]: History drives you from it .
Parsing [sent. 5891 len. 12]: Major Sleeman has a convincing case in one of his books .
Parsing [sent. 5892 len. 37]: In his government on the Nerbudda he made a brave attempt on the 28th of March , 1828 , to put down Suttee on his own hook and without warrant from the Supreme Government of India .
Parsing [sent. 5893 len. 16]: He could not foresee that the Government would put it down itself eight months later .
Parsing [sent. 5894 len. 14]: The only backing he had was a bold nature and a compassionate heart .
Parsing [sent. 5895 len. 11]: He issued his proclamation abolishing the Suttee in his district .
Parsing [sent. 5896 len. 66]: On the morning of Tuesday -- note the day of the week -- the 24th of the following November , Ummed Singh Upadhya , head of the most respectable and most extensive Brahmin family in the district , died , and presently came a deputation of his sons and grandsons to beg that his old widow might be allowed to burn herself upon his pyre .
Parsing [sent. 5897 len. 29]: Sleeman threatened to enforce his order , and punish severely any man who assisted ; and he placed a police guard to see that no one did so .
Parsing [sent. 5898 len. 40]: From the early morning the old widow of sixty-five had been sitting on the bank of the sacred river by her dead , waiting through the long hours for the permission ; and at last the refusal came instead .
Parsing [sent. 5899 len. 38]: In one little sentence Sleeman gives you a pathetic picture of this lonely old gray figure : all day and all night `` she remained sitting by the edge of the water without eating or drinking . ''
Parsing [sent. 5900 len. 33]: The next morning the body of the husband was burned to ashes in a pit eight feet square and three or four feet deep , in the view of several thousand spectators .
Parsing [sent. 5901 len. 24]: Then the widow waded out to a bare rock in the river , and everybody went away but her sons and other relations .
Parsing [sent. 5902 len. 28]: All day she sat there on her rock in the blazing sun without food or drink , and with no clothing but a sheet over her shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 5903 len. 23]: The relatives remained with her and all tried to persuade her to desist from her purpose , for they deeply loved her .
Parsing [sent. 5904 len. 4]: She steadily refused .
Parsing [sent. 5905 len. 28]: Then a part of the family went to Sleeman 's house , ten miles away , and tried again to get him to let her burn herself .
Parsing [sent. 5906 len. 9]: He refused , hoping to save her yet .
Parsing [sent. 5907 len. 26]: All that day she scorched in her sheet on the rock , and all that night she kept her vigil there in the bitter cold .
Parsing [sent. 5908 len. 45]: Thursday morning , in the sight of her relatives , she went through a ceremonial which said more to them than any words could have done ; she put on the dhaja -LRB- a coarse red turban -RRB- and broke her bracelets in pieces .
Parsing [sent. 5909 len. 22]: By these acts she became a dead person in the eye of the law , and excluded from her caste forever .
Parsing [sent. 5910 len. 23]: By the iron rule of ancient custom , if she should now choose to live she could never return to her family .
Parsing [sent. 5911 len. 6]: Sleeman was in deep trouble .
Parsing [sent. 5912 len. 29]: If she starved herself to death her family would be disgraced ; and , moreover , starving would be a more lingering misery than the death by fire .
Parsing [sent. 5913 len. 9]: He went back in the evening thoroughly worried .
Parsing [sent. 5914 len. 24]: The old woman remained on her rock , and there in the morning he found her with her dhaja still on her head .
Parsing [sent. 5915 len. 55]: `` She talked very collectedly , telling me that she had determined to mix her ashes with those of her departed husband , and should patiently wait my permission to do so , assured that God would enable her to sustain life till that was given , though she dared not eat or drink .
Parsing [sent. 5916 len. 90]: Looking at the sun , then rising before her over a long and beautiful reach of the river , she said calmly , ` My soul has been for five days with my husband 's near that sun ; nothing but my earthly frame is left ; and this , I know , you will in time suffer to be mixed with his ashes in yonder pit , because it is not in your nature or usage wantonly to prolong the miseries of a poor old woman . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 5917 len. 35]: He assured her that it was his desire and duty to save her , and to urge her to live , and to keep her family from the disgrace of being thought her murderers .
Parsing [sent. 5918 len. 63]: But she said she `` was not afraid of their being thought so ; that they had all , like good children , done everything in their power to induce her to live , and to abide with them ; and if I should consent I know they would love and honor me , but my duties to them have now ended .
Parsing [sent. 5919 len. 36]: I commit them all to your care , and I go to attend my husband , Ummed Singh Upadhya , with whose ashes on the funeral pile mine have been already three times mixed . ''
Parsing [sent. 5920 len. 33]: She believed that she and he had been upon the earth three several times as wife and husband , and that she had burned herself to death three times upon his pyre .
Parsing [sent. 5921 len. 9]: That is why she said that strange thing .
Parsing [sent. 5922 len. 37]: Since she had broken her bracelets and put on the red turban she regarded herself as a corpse ; otherwise she would not have allowed herself to do her husband the irreverence of pronouncing his name .
Parsing [sent. 5923 len. 39]: `` This was the first time in her long life that she had ever uttered her husband 's name , for in India no woman , high or low , ever pronounces the name of her husband . ''
Parsing [sent. 5924 len. 9]: Major Sleeman still tried to shake her purpose .
Parsing [sent. 5925 len. 58]: He promised to build her a fine house among the temples of her ancestors upon the bank of the river and make handsome provision for her out of rent-free lands if she would consent to live ; and if she would n't he would allow no stone or brick to ever mark the place where she died .
Parsing [sent. 5926 len. 52]: But she only smiled and said , `` My pulse has long ceased to beat , my spirit has departed ; I shall suffer nothing in the burning ; and if you wish proof , order some fire and you shall see this arm consumed without giving me any pain . ''
Parsing [sent. 5927 len. 12]: Sleeman was now satisfied that he could not alter her purpose .
Parsing [sent. 5928 len. 36]: He sent for all the chief members of the family and said he would suffer her to burn herself if they would enter into a written engagement to abandon the suttee in their family thenceforth .
Parsing [sent. 5929 len. 26]: They agreed ; the papers were drawn out and signed , and at noon , Saturday , word was sent to the poor old woman .
Parsing [sent. 5930 len. 5]: She seemed greatly pleased .
Parsing [sent. 5931 len. 26]: The ceremonies of bathing were gone through with , and by three o'clock she was ready and the fire was briskly burning in the pit .
Parsing [sent. 5932 len. 17]: She had now gone without food or drink during more than four days and a half .
Parsing [sent. 5933 len. 62]: She came ashore from her rock , first wetting her sheet in the waters of the sacred river , for without that safeguard any shadow which might fall upon her would convey impurity to her ; then she walked to the pit , leaning upon one of her sons and a nephew -- the distance was a hundred and fifty yards .
Parsing [sent. 5934 len. 20]: `` I had sentries placed all around , and no other person was allowed to approach within five paces .
Parsing [sent. 5935 len. 36]: She came on with a calm and cheerful countenance , stopped once , and casting her eyes upwards , said , ` Why have they kept me five days from thee , my husband ? '
Parsing [sent. 5936 len. 40]: On coming to the sentries her supporters stopped and remained standing ; she moved on , and walked once around the pit , paused a moment , and while muttering a prayer , threw some flowers into the fire .
Parsing [sent. 5937 len. 49]: She then walked up deliberately and steadily to the brink , stepped into the centre of the flame , sat down , and leaning back in the midst as if reposing upon a couch , was consumed without uttering a shriek or betraying one sign of agony . ''
Parsing [sent. 5938 len. 6]: It is fine and beautiful .
Parsing [sent. 5939 len. 18]: It compels one 's reverence and respect -- no , has it freely , and without compulsion .
Parsing [sent. 5940 len. 58]: We see how the custom , once started , could continue , for the soul of it is that stupendous power , Faith ; faith brought to the pitch of effectiveness by the cumulative force of example and long use and custom ; but we can not understand how the first widows came to take to it .
Parsing [sent. 5941 len. 6]: That is a perplexing detail .
Parsing [sent. 5942 len. 42]: Sleeman says that it was usual to play music at the suttee , but that the white man 's notion that this was to drown the screams of the martyr is not correct ; that it had a quite different purpose .
Parsing [sent. 5943 len. 47]: It was believed that the martyr died prophecying ; that the prophecies sometimes foretold disaster , and it was considered a kindness to those upon whom it was to fall to drown the voice and keep them in ignorance of the misfortune that was to come .
Parsing [sent. 5944 len. 3]: CHAPTER XLIX .
Parsing [sent. 5945 len. 43]: He had had much experience of physicians , and said `` the only way to keep your health is to eat what you do n't want , drink what you do n't like , and do what you 'd druther not . ''
Parsing [sent. 5946 len. 9]: -- Pudd ` nhead Wilson 's New Calendar .
Parsing [sent. 5947 len. 36]: It was a long journey -- two nights , one day , and part of another day , from Bombay eastward to Allahabad ; but it was always interesting , and it was not fatiguing .
Parsing [sent. 5948 len. 18]: At first the night travel promised to be fatiguing , but that was on account of pyjamas .
Parsing [sent. 5949 len. 9]: This foolish night-dress consists of jacket and drawers .
Parsing [sent. 5950 len. 22]: Sometimes they are made of silk , sometimes of a raspy , scratchy , slazy woolen material with a sandpaper surface .
Parsing [sent. 5951 len. 26]: The drawers are loose elephant-legged and elephant-waisted things , and instead of buttoning around the body there is a drawstring to produce the required shrinkage .
Parsing [sent. 5952 len. 12]: The jacket is roomy , and one buttons it in front .
Parsing [sent. 5953 len. 22]: Pyjamas are hot on a hot night and cold on a cold night -- defects which a nightshirt is free from .
Parsing [sent. 5954 len. 27]: I tried the pyjamas in order to be in the fashion ; but I was obliged to give them up , I could n't stand them .
Parsing [sent. 5955 len. 10]: There was no sufficient change from day-gear to night-gear .
Parsing [sent. 5956 len. 26]: I missed the refreshing and luxurious sense , induced by the night-gown , of being undressed , emancipated , set free from restraints and trammels .
Parsing [sent. 5957 len. 24]: In place of that , I had the worried , confined , oppressed , suffocated sense of being abed with my clothes on .
Parsing [sent. 5958 len. 75]: All through the warm half of the night the coarse surfaces irritated my skin and made it feel baked and feverish , and the dreams which came in the fitful flurries of slumber were such as distress the sleep of the damned , or ought to ; and all through the cold other half of the night I could get no time for sleep because I had to employ it all in stealing blankets .
Parsing [sent. 5959 len. 31]: But blankets are of no value at such a time ; the higher they are piled the more effectively they cork the cold in and keep it from getting out .
Parsing [sent. 5960 len. 24]: The result is that your legs are ice , and you know how you will feel by and by when you are buried .
Parsing [sent. 5961 len. 18]: In a sane interval I discarded the pyjamas , and led a rational and comfortable life thenceforth .
Parsing [sent. 5962 len. 12]: Out in the country in India , the day begins early .
Parsing [sent. 5963 len. 85]: One sees a plain , perfectly flat , dust-colored and brick-yardy , stretching limitlessly away on every side in the dim gray light , striped everywhere with hard-beaten narrow paths , the vast flatness broken at wide intervals by bunches of spectral trees that mark where villages are ; and along all the paths are slender women and the black forms of lanky naked men moving , to their work , the women with brass water-jars on their heads , the men carrying hoes .
Parsing [sent. 5964 len. 46]: The man is not entirely naked ; always there is a bit of white rag , a loin-cloth ; it amounts to a bandage , and is a white accent on his black person , like the silver band around the middle of a pipe-stem .
Parsing [sent. 5965 len. 18]: Sometimes he also wears a fluffy and voluminous white turban , and this adds a second accent .
Parsing [sent. 5966 len. 30]: He then answers properly to Miss Gordon Cumming 's flash-light picture of him -- as a person who is dressed in `` a turban and a pocket handkerchief . ''
Parsing [sent. 5967 len. 20]: All day long one has this monotony of dust-colored dead levels and scattering bunches of trees and mud villages .
Parsing [sent. 5968 len. 26]: You soon realize that India is not beautiful ; still there is an enchantment about it that is beguiling , and which does not pall .
Parsing [sent. 5969 len. 25]: You can not tell just what it is that makes the spell , perhaps , but you feel it and confess it , nevertheless .
Parsing [sent. 5970 len. 105]: Of course , at bottom , you know in a vague way that it is history ; it is that that affects you , a haunting sense of the myriads of human lives that have blossomed , and withered , and perished here , repeating and repeating and repeating , century after century , and age after age , the barren and meaningless process ; it is this sense that gives to this forlorn , uncomely land power to speak to the spirit and make friends with it ; to speak to it with a voice bitter with satire , but eloquent with melancholy .
Parsing [sent. 5971 len. 52]: The deserts of Australia and the ice-barrens of Greenland have no speech , for they have no venerable history ; with nothing to tell of man and his vanities , his fleeting glories and his miseries , they have nothing wherewith to spiritualize their ugliness and veil it with a charm .
Parsing [sent. 5972 len. 32]: There is nothing pretty about an Indian village -- a mud one -- and I do not remember that we saw any but mud ones on that long flight to Allahabad .
Parsing [sent. 5973 len. 16]: It is a little bunch of dirt-colored mud hovels jammed together within a mud wall .
Parsing [sent. 5974 len. 30]: As a rule , the rains had beaten down parts of some of the houses , and this gave the village the aspect of a mouldering and hoary ruin .
Parsing [sent. 5975 len. 34]: I believe the cattle and the vermin live inside the wall ; for I saw cattle coming out and cattle going in ; and whenever I saw a villager , he was scratching .
Parsing [sent. 5976 len. 14]: This last is only circumstantial evidence , but I think it has value .
Parsing [sent. 5977 len. 30]: The village has a battered little temple or two , big enough to hold an idol , and with custom enough to fat-up a priest and keep him comfortable .
Parsing [sent. 5978 len. 22]: Where there are Mohammedans there are generally a few sorry tombs outside the village that have a decayed and neglected look .
Parsing [sent. 5979 len. 29]: The villages interested me because of things which Major Sleeman says about them in his books -- particularly what he says about the division of labor in them .
Parsing [sent. 5980 len. 87]: He says that the whole face of India is parceled out into estates of villages ; that nine-tenths of the vast population of the land consist of cultivators of the soil ; that it is these cultivators who inhabit the villages ; that there are certain `` established '' village servants -- mechanics and others who are apparently paid a wage by the village at large , and whose callings remain in certain families and are handed down from father to son , like an estate .
Parsing [sent. 5981 len. 39]: He gives a list of these established servants : Priest , blacksmith , carpenter , accountant , washerman , basketmaker , potter , watchman , barber , shoemaker , brazier , confectioner , weaver , dyer , etc. .
Parsing [sent. 5982 len. 65]: In his day witches abounded , and it was not thought good business wisdom for a man to marry his daughter into a family that had n't a witch in it , for she would need a witch on the premises to protect her children from the evil spells which would certainly be cast upon them by the witches connected with the neighboring families .
Parsing [sent. 5983 len. 13]: The office of midwife was hereditary in the family of the basket-maker .
Parsing [sent. 5984 len. 6]: It belonged to his wife .
Parsing [sent. 5985 len. 14]: She might not be competent , but the office was hers , anyway .
Parsing [sent. 5986 len. 20]: Her pay was not high -- 25 cents for a boy , and half as much for a girl .
Parsing [sent. 5987 len. 17]: The girl was not desired , because she would be a disastrous expense by and by .
Parsing [sent. 5988 len. 78]: As soon as she should be old enough to begin to wear clothes for propriety 's sake , it would be a disgrace to the family if she were not married ; and to marry her meant financial ruin ; for by custom the father must spend upon feasting and wedding-display everything he had and all he could borrow -- in fact , reduce himself to a condition of poverty which he might never more recover from .
Parsing [sent. 5989 len. 36]: It was the dread of this prospective ruin which made the killing of girl-babies so prevalent in India in the old days before England laid the iron hand of her prohibitions upon the piteous slaughter .
Parsing [sent. 5990 len. 35]: One may judge of how prevalent the custom was , by one of Sleeman 's casual electrical remarks , when he speaks of children at play in villages -- where girl-voices were never heard !
Parsing [sent. 5991 len. 43]: The wedding-display folly is still in full force in India , and by consequence the destruction of girl-babies is still furtively practiced ; but not largely , because of the vigilance of the government and the sternness of the penalties it levies .
Parsing [sent. 5992 len. 111]: In some parts of India the village keeps in its pay three other servants : an astrologer to tell the villager when he may plant his crop , or make a journey , or marry a wife , or strangle a child , or borrow a dog , or climb a tree , or catch a rat , or swindle a neighbor , without offending the alert and solicitous heavens ; and what his dream means , if he has had one and was not bright enough to interpret it himself by the details of his dinner ; the two other established servants were the tiger-persuader and the hailstorm discourager .
Parsing [sent. 5993 len. 30]: The one kept away the tigers if he could , and collected the wages anyway , and the other kept off the hailstorms , or explained why he failed .
Parsing [sent. 5994 len. 16]: He charged the same for explaining a failure that he did for scoring a success .
Parsing [sent. 5995 len. 14]: A man is an idiot who ca n't earn a living in India .
Parsing [sent. 5996 len. 17]: Major Sleeman reveals the fact that the trade union and the boycott are antiquities in India .
Parsing [sent. 5997 len. 7]: India seems to have originated everything .
Parsing [sent. 5998 len. 28]: The `` sweeper '' belongs to the bottom caste ; he is the lowest of the low -- all other castes despise him and scorn his office .
Parsing [sent. 5999 len. 7]: But that does not trouble him .
Parsing [sent. 6000 len. 24]: His caste is a caste , and that is sufficient for him , and so he is proud of it , not ashamed .
Parsing [sent. 6001 len. 61]: Sleeman says : `` It is perhaps not known to many of my countrymen , even in India , that in every town and city in the country the right of sweeping the houses and streets is a monopoly , and is supported entirely by the pride of castes among the scavengers , who are all of the lowest class .
Parsing [sent. 6002 len. 70]: The right of sweeping within a certain range is recognized by the caste to belong to a certain member ; and if any other member presumes to sweep within that range , he is excommunicated -- no other member will smoke out of his pipe or drink out of his jug ; and he can get restored to caste only by a feast to the whole body of sweepers .
Parsing [sent. 6003 len. 58]: If any housekeeper within a particular circle happens to offend the sweeper of that range , none of his filth will be removed till he pacifies him , because no other sweeper will dare to touch it ; and the people of a town are often more tyrannized over by these people than by any other . ''
Parsing [sent. 6004 len. 40]: A footnote by Major Sleeman 's editor , Mr. Vincent Arthur Smith , says that in our day this tyranny of the sweepers ' guild is one of the many difficulties which bar the progress of Indian sanitary reform .
Parsing [sent. 6005 len. 39]: Think of this : `` The sweepers can not be readily coerced , because no Hindoo or Mussulman would do their work to save his life , nor will he pollute himself by beating the refractory scavenger . ''
Parsing [sent. 6006 len. 20]: They certainly do seem to have the whip-hand ; it would be difficult to imagine a more impregnable position .
Parsing [sent. 6007 len. 26]: `` The vested rights described in the text are so fully recognized in practice that they are frequently the subject of sale or mortgage . ''
Parsing [sent. 6008 len. 11]: Just like a milk-route ; or like a London crossing-sweepership .
Parsing [sent. 6009 len. 44]: It is said that the London crossing-sweeper 's right to his crossing is recognized by the rest of the guild ; that they protect him in its possession ; that certain choice crossings are valuable property , and are saleable at high figures .
Parsing [sent. 6010 len. 65]: I have noticed that the man who sweeps in front of the Army and Navy Stores has a wealthy South African aristocratic style about him ; and when he is off his guard , he has exactly that look on his face which you always see in the face of a man who is saving up his daughter to marry her to a duke .
Parsing [sent. 6011 len. 16]: It appears from Sleeman that in India the occupation of elephant-driver is confined to Mohammedans .
Parsing [sent. 6012 len. 6]: I wonder why that is .
Parsing [sent. 6013 len. 54]: The water-carrier -LRB- ` bheestie ' -RRB- is a Mohammedan , but it is said that the reason of that is , that the Hindoo 's religion does not allow him to touch the skin of dead kine , and that is what the water-sack is made of ; it would defile him .
Parsing [sent. 6014 len. 30]: And it does n't allow him to eat meat ; the animal that furnished the meat was murdered , and to take any creature 's life is a sin .
Parsing [sent. 6015 len. 11]: It is a good and gentle religion , but inconvenient .
Parsing [sent. 6016 len. 49]: A great Indian river , at low water , suggests the familiar anatomical picture of a skinned human body , the intricate mesh of interwoven muscles and tendons to stand for water-channels , and the archipelagoes of fat and flesh inclosed by them to stand for the sandbars .
Parsing [sent. 6017 len. 26]: Somewhere on this journey we passed such a river , and on a later journey we saw in the Sutlej the duplicate of that river .
Parsing [sent. 6018 len. 68]: Curious rivers they are ; low shores a dizzy distance apart , with nothing between but an enormous acreage of sand-flats with sluggish little veins of water dribbling around amongst them ; Saharas of sand , smallpox-pitted with footprints punctured in belts as straight as the equator clear from the one shore to the other -LRB- barring the channel-interruptions -RRB- -- a dry-shod ferry , you see .
Parsing [sent. 6019 len. 16]: Long railway bridges are required for this sort of rivers , and India has them .
Parsing [sent. 6020 len. 9]: You approach Allahabad by a very long one .
Parsing [sent. 6021 len. 29]: It was now carrying us across the bed of the Jumna , a bed which did not seem to have been slept in for one while or more .
Parsing [sent. 6022 len. 13]: It was n't all river-bed -- most of it was overflow ground .
Parsing [sent. 6023 len. 8]: Allahabad means `` City of God . ''
Parsing [sent. 6024 len. 7]: I get this from the books .
Parsing [sent. 6025 len. 39]: From a printed curiosity -- a letter written by one of those brave and confident Hindoo strugglers with the English tongue , called a `` babu '' -- I got a more compressed translation : `` Godville . ''
Parsing [sent. 6026 len. 17]: It is perfectly correct , but that is the most that can be said for it .
Parsing [sent. 6027 len. 27]: We arrived in the forenoon , and short-handed ; for Satan got left behind somewhere that morning , and did not overtake us until after nightfall .
Parsing [sent. 6028 len. 7]: It seemed very peaceful without him .
Parsing [sent. 6029 len. 7]: The world seemed asleep and dreaming .
Parsing [sent. 6030 len. 11]: I did not see the native town , I think .
Parsing [sent. 6031 len. 26]: I do not remember why ; for an incident connects it with the Great Mutiny , and that is enough to make any place interesting .
Parsing [sent. 6032 len. 10]: But I saw the English part of the city .
Parsing [sent. 6033 len. 42]: It is a town of wide avenues and noble distances , and is comely and alluring , and full of suggestions of comfort and leisure , and of the serenity which a good conscience buttressed by a sufficient bank account gives .
Parsing [sent. 6034 len. 35]: The bungalows -LRB- dwellings -RRB- stand well back in the seclusion and privacy of large enclosed compounds -LRB- private grounds , as we should say -RRB- and in the shade and shelter of trees .
Parsing [sent. 6035 len. 29]: Even the photographer and the prosperous merchant ply their industries in the elegant reserve of big compounds , and the citizens drive in there upon their business occasions .
Parsing [sent. 6036 len. 42]: And not in cabs -- no ; in the Indian cities cabs are for the drifting stranger ; all the white citizens have private carriages ; and each carriage has a flock of white-turbaned black footmen and drivers all over it .
Parsing [sent. 6037 len. 20]: The vicinity of a lecture-hall looks like a snowstorm , -- and makes the lecturer feel like an opera .
Parsing [sent. 6038 len. 11]: India has many names , and they are correctly descriptive .
Parsing [sent. 6039 len. 113]: It is the Land of Contradictions , the Land of Subtlety and Superstition , the Land of Wealth and Poverty , the Land of Splendor and Desolation , the Land of Plague and Famine , the Land of the Thug and the Poisoner , and of the Meek and the Patient , the Land of the Suttee , the Land of the Unreinstatable Widow , the Land where All Life is Holy , the Land of Cremation , the Land where the Vulture is a Grave and a Monument , the Land of the Multitudinous Gods ; and if signs go for anything , it is the Land of the Private Carriage .
Parsing [sent. 6040 len. 32]: In Bombay the forewoman of a millinery shop came to the hotel in her private carriage to take the measure for a gown -- not for me , but for another .
Parsing [sent. 6041 len. 29]: She had come out to India to make a temporary stay , but was extending it indefinitely ; indeed , she was purposing to end her days there .
Parsing [sent. 6042 len. 101]: In London , she said , her work had been hard , her hours long ; for economy 's sake she had had to live in shabby rooms and far away from the shop , watch the pennies , deny herself many of the common comforts of life , restrict herself in effect to its bare necessities , eschew cabs , travel third-class by underground train to and from her work , swallowing coal-smoke and cinders all the way , and sometimes troubled with the society of men and women who were less desirable than the smoke and the cinders .
Parsing [sent. 6043 len. 39]: But in Bombay , on almost any kind of wages , she could live in comfort , and keep her carriage , and have six servants in place of the woman-of-all-work she had had in her English home .
Parsing [sent. 6044 len. 40]: Later , in Calcutta , I found that the Standard Oil clerks had small one-horse vehicles , and did no walking ; and I was told that the clerks of the other large concerns there had the like equipment .
Parsing [sent. 6045 len. 6]: But to return to Allahabad .
Parsing [sent. 6046 len. 10]: I was up at dawn , the next morning .
Parsing [sent. 6047 len. 48]: In India the tourist 's servant does not sleep in a room in the hotel , but rolls himself up head and ears in his blanket and stretches himself on the veranda , across the front of his master 's door , and spends the night there .
Parsing [sent. 6048 len. 11]: I do n't believe anybody 's servant occupies a room .
Parsing [sent. 6049 len. 21]: Apparently , the bungalow servants sleep on the veranda ; it is roomy , and goes all around the house .
Parsing [sent. 6050 len. 13]: I speak of menservants ; I saw none of the other sex .
Parsing [sent. 6051 len. 9]: I think there are none , except child-nurses .
Parsing [sent. 6052 len. 18]: I was up at dawn , and walked around the veranda , past the rows of sleepers .
Parsing [sent. 6053 len. 19]: In front of one door a Hindoo servant was squatting , waiting for his master to call him .
Parsing [sent. 6054 len. 23]: He had polished the yellow shoes and placed them by the door , and now he had nothing to do but wait .
Parsing [sent. 6055 len. 21]: It was freezing cold , but there he was , as motionless as a sculptured image , and as patient .
Parsing [sent. 6056 len. 4]: It troubled me .
Parsing [sent. 6057 len. 30]: I wanted to say to him , `` Do n't crouch there like that and freeze ; nobody requires it of you ; stir around and get warm . ''
Parsing [sent. 6058 len. 7]: But I had n't the words .
Parsing [sent. 6059 len. 25]: I thought of saying ` jeldy jow ' , but I could n't remember what it meant , so I did n't say it .
Parsing [sent. 6060 len. 14]: I knew another phrase , but it would n't come to my mind .
Parsing [sent. 6061 len. 23]: I moved on , purposing to dismiss him from my thoughts , but his bare legs and bare feet kept him there .
Parsing [sent. 6062 len. 18]: They kept drawing me back from the sunny side to a point whence I could see him .
Parsing [sent. 6063 len. 17]: At the end of an hour he had not changed his attitude in the least degree .
Parsing [sent. 6064 len. 23]: It was a curious and impressive exhibition of meekness and patience , or fortitude or indifference , I did not know which .
Parsing [sent. 6065 len. 12]: But it worried me , and it was spoiling my morning .
Parsing [sent. 6066 len. 12]: In fact , it spoiled two hours of it quite thoroughly .
Parsing [sent. 6067 len. 21]: I quitted this vicinity , then , and left him to punish himself as much as he might want to .
Parsing [sent. 6068 len. 15]: But up to that time the man had not changed his attitude a hair .
Parsing [sent. 6069 len. 19]: He will always remain with me , I suppose ; his figure never grows vague in my memory .
Parsing [sent. 6070 len. 22]: Whenever I read of Indian resignation , Indian patience under wrongs , hardships , and misfortunes , he comes before me .
Parsing [sent. 6071 len. 12]: He becomes a personification , and stands for India in trouble .
Parsing [sent. 6072 len. 36]: And for untold ages India in trouble has been pursued with the very remark which I was going to utter but did n't , because its meaning had slipped me : `` Jeldy jow ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6073 len. 9]: -LRB- `` Come , shove along ! '' -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 6074 len. 8]: Why , it was the very thing .
Parsing [sent. 6075 len. 14]: In the early brightness we made a long drive out to the Fort .
Parsing [sent. 6076 len. 7]: Part of the way was beautiful .
Parsing [sent. 6077 len. 75]: It led under stately trees and through groups of native houses and by the usual village well , where the picturesque gangs are always flocking to and fro and laughing and chattering ; and this time brawny men were deluging their bronze bodies with the limpid water , and making a refreshing and enticing show of it ; enticing , for the sun was already transacting business , firing India up for the day .
Parsing [sent. 6078 len. 29]: There was plenty of this early bathing going on , for it was getting toward breakfast time , and with an unpurified body the Hindoo must not eat .
Parsing [sent. 6079 len. 51]: Then we struck into the hot plain , and found the roads crowded with pilgrims of both sexes , for one of the great religious fairs of India was being held , just beyond the Fort , at the junction of the sacred rivers , the Ganges and the Jumna .
Parsing [sent. 6080 len. 16]: Three sacred rivers , I should have said , for there is a subterranean one .
Parsing [sent. 6081 len. 11]: Nobody has seen it , but that does n't signify .
Parsing [sent. 6082 len. 9]: The fact that it is there is enough .
Parsing [sent. 6083 len. 95]: These pilgrims had come from all over India ; some of them had been months on the way , plodding patiently along in the heat and dust , worn , poor , hungry , but supported and sustained by an unwavering faith and belief ; they were supremely happy and content , now ; their full and sufficient reward was at hand ; they were going to be cleansed from every vestige of sin and corruption by these holy waters which make utterly pure whatsoever thing they touch , even the dead and rotten .
Parsing [sent. 6084 len. 45]: It is wonderful , the power of a faith like that , that can make multitudes upon multitudes of the old and weak and the young and frail enter without hesitation or complaint upon such incredible journeys and endure the resultant miseries without repining .
Parsing [sent. 6085 len. 21]: It is done in love , or it is done in fear ; I do not know which it is .
Parsing [sent. 6086 len. 26]: No matter what the impulse is , the act born of it is beyond imagination marvelous to our kind of people , the cold whites .
Parsing [sent. 6087 len. 34]: There are choice great natures among us that could exhibit the equivalent of this prodigious self-sacrifice , but the rest of us know that we should not be equal to anything approaching it .
Parsing [sent. 6088 len. 24]: Still , we all talk self-sacrifice , and this makes me hope that we are large enough to honor it in the Hindoo .
Parsing [sent. 6089 len. 11]: Two millions of natives arrive at this fair every year .
Parsing [sent. 6090 len. 48]: How many start , and die on the road , from age and fatigue and disease and scanty nourishment , and how many die on the return , from the same causes , no one knows ; but the tale is great , one may say enormous .
Parsing [sent. 6091 len. 22]: Every twelfth year is held to be a year of peculiar grace ; a greatly augmented volume of pilgrims results then .
Parsing [sent. 6092 len. 16]: The twelfth year has held this distinction since the remotest times , it is said .
Parsing [sent. 6093 len. 19]: It is said also that there is to be but one more twelfth year -- for the Ganges .
Parsing [sent. 6094 len. 36]: After that , that holiest of all sacred rivers will cease to be holy , and will be abandoned by the pilgrim for many centuries ; how many , the wise men have not stated .
Parsing [sent. 6095 len. 12]: At the end of that interval it will become holy again .
Parsing [sent. 6096 len. 23]: Meantime , the data will be arranged by those people who have charge of all such matters , the great chief Brahmins .
Parsing [sent. 6097 len. 9]: It will be like shutting down a mint .
Parsing [sent. 6098 len. 24]: At a first glance it looks most unbrahminically uncommercial , but I am not disturbed , being soothed and tranquilized by their reputation .
Parsing [sent. 6099 len. 45]: `` Brer fox he lay low , '' as Uncle Remus says ; and at the judicious time he will spring something on the Indian public which will show that he was not financially asleep when he took the Ganges out of the market .
Parsing [sent. 6100 len. 17]: Great numbers of the natives along the roads were bringing away holy water from the rivers .
Parsing [sent. 6101 len. 13]: They would carry it far and wide in India and sell it .
Parsing [sent. 6102 len. 53]: Tavernier , the French traveler -LRB- 17th century -RRB- , notes that Ganges water is often given at weddings , `` each guest receiving a cup or two , according to the liberality of the host ; sometimes 2,000 or 3,000 rupees ' worth of it is consumed at a wedding . ''
Parsing [sent. 6103 len. 17]: The Fort is a huge old structure , and has had a large experience in religions .
Parsing [sent. 6104 len. 50]: In its great court stands a monolith which was placed there more than 2,000 years ago to preach -LRB- Budhism -RRB- by its pious inscription ; the Fort was built three centuries ago by a Mohammedan Emperor -- a resanctification of the place in the interest of that religion .
Parsing [sent. 6105 len. 32]: There is a Hindoo temple , too , with subterranean ramifications stocked with shrines and idols ; and now the Fort belongs to the English , it contains a Christian Church .
Parsing [sent. 6106 len. 6]: Insured in all the companies .
Parsing [sent. 6107 len. 14]: From the lofty ramparts one has a fine view of the sacred rivers .
Parsing [sent. 6108 len. 27]: They join at that point -- the pale blue Jumna , apparently clean and clear , and the muddy Ganges , dull yellow and not clean .
Parsing [sent. 6109 len. 29]: On a long curved spit between the rivers , towns of tents were visible , with a multitude of fluttering pennons , and a mighty swarm of pilgrims .
Parsing [sent. 6110 len. 24]: It was a troublesome place to get down to , and not a quiet place when you arrived ; but it was interesting .
Parsing [sent. 6111 len. 35]: There was a world of activity and turmoil and noise , partly religious , partly commercial ; for the Mohammedans were there to curse and sell , and the Hindoos to buy and pray .
Parsing [sent. 6112 len. 11]: It is a fair as well as a religious festival .
Parsing [sent. 6113 len. 53]: Crowds were bathing , praying , and drinking the purifying waters , and many sick pilgrims had come long journeys in palanquins to be healed of their maladies by a bath ; or if that might not be , then to die on the blessed banks and so make sure of heaven .
Parsing [sent. 6114 len. 68]: There were fakeers in plenty , with their bodies dusted over with ashes and their long hair caked together with cow-dung ; for the cow is holy and so is the rest of it ; so holy that the good Hindoo peasant frescoes the walls of his hut with this refuse , and also constructs ornamental figures out of it for the gracing of his dirt floor .
Parsing [sent. 6115 len. 23]: There were seated families , fearfully and wonderfully painted , who by attitude and grouping represented the families of certain great gods .
Parsing [sent. 6116 len. 57]: There was a holy man who sat naked by the day and by the week on a cluster of iron spikes , and did not seem to mind it ; and another holy man , who stood all day holding his withered arms motionless aloft , and was said to have been doing it for years .
Parsing [sent. 6117 len. 39]: All of these performers have a cloth on the ground beside them for the reception of contributions , and even the poorest of the people give a trifle and hope that the sacrifice will be blessed to him .
Parsing [sent. 6118 len. 20]: At last came a procession of naked holy people marching by and chanting , and I wrenched myself away .
Parsing [sent. 6119 len. 3]: CHAPTER L .
Parsing [sent. 6120 len. 18]: The man who is ostentatious of his modesty is twin to the statue that wears a fig-leaf .
Parsing [sent. 6121 len. 9]: -- Pudd ` nhead Wilson 's New Calendar .
Parsing [sent. 6122 len. 16]: The journey to Benares was all in daylight , and occupied but a few hours .
Parsing [sent. 6123 len. 5]: It was admirably dusty .
Parsing [sent. 6124 len. 33]: The dust settled upon you in a thick ashy layer and turned you into a fakeer , with nothing lacking to the role but the cow manure and the sense of holiness .
Parsing [sent. 6125 len. 29]: There was a change of cars about mid-afternoon at Moghul-serai -- if that was the name -- and a wait of two hours there for the Benares train .
Parsing [sent. 6126 len. 21]: We could have found a carriage and driven to the sacred city , but we should have lost the wait .
Parsing [sent. 6127 len. 28]: In other countries a long wait at a station is a dull thing and tedious , but one has no right to have that feeling in India .
Parsing [sent. 6128 len. 41]: You have the monster crowd of bejeweled natives , the stir , the bustle , the confusion , the shifting splendors of the costumes -- dear me , the delight of it , the charm of it are beyond speech .
Parsing [sent. 6129 len. 8]: The two-hour wait was over too soon .
Parsing [sent. 6130 len. 39]: Among other satisfying things to look at was a minor native prince from the backwoods somewhere , with his guard of honor , a ragged but wonderfully gaudy gang of fifty dark barbarians armed with rusty flint-lock muskets .
Parsing [sent. 6131 len. 42]: The general show came so near to exhausting variety that one would have said that no addition to it could be conspicuous , but when this Falstaff and his motleys marched through it one saw that that seeming impossibility had happened .
Parsing [sent. 6132 len. 33]: We got away by and by , and soon reached the outer edge of Benares ; then there was another wait ; but , as usual , with something to look at .
Parsing [sent. 6133 len. 10]: This was a cluster of little canvas-boxes -- palanquins .
Parsing [sent. 6134 len. 28]: A canvas-box is not much of a sight -- when empty ; but when there is a lady in it , it is an object of interest .
Parsing [sent. 6135 len. 25]: These boxes were grouped apart , in the full blaze of the terrible sun during the three-quarters of an hour that we tarried there .
Parsing [sent. 6136 len. 5]: They contained zenana ladies .
Parsing [sent. 6137 len. 15]: They had to sit up ; there was not room enough to stretch out .
Parsing [sent. 6138 len. 7]: They probably did not mind it .
Parsing [sent. 6139 len. 40]: They are used to the close captivity of their dwellings all their lives ; when they go a journey they are carried to the train in these boxes ; in the train they have to be secluded from inspection .
Parsing [sent. 6140 len. 26]: Many people pity them , and I always did it myself and never charged anything ; but it is doubtful if this compassion is valued .
Parsing [sent. 6141 len. 53]: While we were in India some good-hearted Europeans in one of the cities proposed to restrict a large park to the use of zenana ladies , so that they could go there and in assured privacy go about unveiled and enjoy the sunshine and air as they had never enjoyed them before .
Parsing [sent. 6142 len. 41]: The good intentions back of the proposition were recognized , and sincere thanks returned for it , but the proposition itself met with a prompt declination at the hands of those who were authorized to speak for the zenana ladies .
Parsing [sent. 6143 len. 18]: Apparently , the idea was shocking to the ladies -- indeed , it was quite manifestly shocking .
Parsing [sent. 6144 len. 23]: Was that proposition the equivalent of inviting European ladies to assemble scantily and scandalously clothed in the seclusion of a private park ?
Parsing [sent. 6145 len. 7]: It seemed to be about that .
Parsing [sent. 6146 len. 47]: Without doubt modesty is nothing less than a holy feeling ; and without doubt the person whose rule of modesty has been transgressed feels the same sort of wound that he would feel if something made holy to him by his religion had suffered a desecration .
Parsing [sent. 6147 len. 30]: I say `` rule of modesty '' because there are about a million rules in the world , and this makes a million standards to be looked out for .
Parsing [sent. 6148 len. 53]: Major Sleeman mentions the case of some high-caste veiled ladies who were profoundly scandalized when some English young ladies passed by with faces bare to the world ; so scandalized that they spoke out with strong indignation and wondered that people could be so shameless as to expose their persons like that .
Parsing [sent. 6149 len. 14]: And yet `` the legs of the objectors were naked to mid-thigh . ''
Parsing [sent. 6150 len. 30]: Both parties were clean-minded and irreproachably modest , while abiding by their separate rules , but they could n't have traded rules for a change without suffering considerable discomfort .
Parsing [sent. 6151 len. 12]: All human rules are more or less idiotic , I suppose .
Parsing [sent. 6152 len. 8]: It is best so , no doubt .
Parsing [sent. 6153 len. 31]: The way it is now , the asylums can hold the sane people , but if we tried to shut up the insane we should run out of building materials .
Parsing [sent. 6154 len. 17]: You have a long drive through the outskirts of Benares before you get to the hotel .
Parsing [sent. 6155 len. 7]: And all the aspects are melancholy .
Parsing [sent. 6156 len. 21]: It is a vision of dusty sterility , decaying temples , crumbling tombs , broken mud walls , shabby huts .
Parsing [sent. 6157 len. 11]: The whole region seems to ache with age and penury .
Parsing [sent. 6158 len. 14]: It must take ten thousand years of want to produce such an aspect .
Parsing [sent. 6159 len. 15]: We were still outside of the great native city when we reached the hotel .
Parsing [sent. 6160 len. 14]: It was a quiet and homelike house , inviting , and manifestly comfortable .
Parsing [sent. 6161 len. 11]: But we liked its annex better , and went thither .
Parsing [sent. 6162 len. 36]: It was a mile away , perhaps , and stood in the midst of a large compound , and was built bungalow fashion , everything on the ground floor , and a veranda all around .
Parsing [sent. 6163 len. 13]: They have doors in India , but I do n't know why .
Parsing [sent. 6164 len. 30]: They do n't fasten , and they stand open , as a rule , with a curtain hanging in the doorspace to keep out the glare of the sun .
Parsing [sent. 6165 len. 21]: Still , there is plenty of privacy , for no white person will come in without notice , of course .
Parsing [sent. 6166 len. 14]: The native men servants will , but they do n't seem to count .
Parsing [sent. 6167 len. 18]: They glide in , barefoot and noiseless , and are in the midst before one knows it .
Parsing [sent. 6168 len. 26]: At first this is a shock , and sometimes it is an embarrassment ; but one has to get used to it , and does .
Parsing [sent. 6169 len. 15]: There was one tree in the compound , and a monkey lived in it .
Parsing [sent. 6170 len. 33]: At first I was strongly interested in the tree , for I was told that it was the renowned peepul -- the tree in whose shadow you can not tell a lie .
Parsing [sent. 6171 len. 16]: This one failed to stand the test , and I went away from it disappointed .
Parsing [sent. 6172 len. 36]: There was a softly creaking well close by , and a couple of oxen drew water from it by the hour , superintended by two natives dressed in the usual `` turban and pocket-handkerchief . ''
Parsing [sent. 6173 len. 31]: The tree and the well were the only scenery , and so the compound was a soothing and lonesome and satisfying place ; and very restful after so many activities .
Parsing [sent. 6174 len. 25]: There was nobody in our bungalow but ourselves ; the other guests were in the next one , where the table d'hote was furnished .
Parsing [sent. 6175 len. 9]: A body could not be more pleasantly situated .
Parsing [sent. 6176 len. 28]: Each room had the customary bath attached -- a room ten or twelve feet square , with a roomy stone-paved pit in it and abundance of water .
Parsing [sent. 6177 len. 35]: One could not easily improve upon this arrangement , except by furnishing it with cold water and excluding the hot , in deference to the fervency of the climate ; but that is forbidden .
Parsing [sent. 6178 len. 8]: It would damage the bather 's health .
Parsing [sent. 6179 len. 34]: The stranger is warned against taking cold baths in India , but even the most intelligent strangers are fools , and they do not obey , and so they presently get laid up .
Parsing [sent. 6180 len. 13]: I was the most intelligent fool that passed through , that year .
Parsing [sent. 6181 len. 8]: But I am still more intelligent now .
Parsing [sent. 6182 len. 7]: Now that it is too late .
Parsing [sent. 6183 len. 25]: I wonder if the ` dorian ' , if that is the name of it , is another superstition , like the peepul tree .
Parsing [sent. 6184 len. 19]: There was a great abundance and variety of tropical fruits , but the dorian was never in evidence .
Parsing [sent. 6185 len. 9]: It was never the season for the dorian .
Parsing [sent. 6186 len. 17]: It was always going to arrive from Burma sometime or other , but it never did .
Parsing [sent. 6187 len. 23]: By all accounts it was a most strange fruit , and incomparably delicious to the taste , but not to the smell .
Parsing [sent. 6188 len. 31]: Its rind was said to exude a stench of so atrocious a nature that when a dorian was in the room even the presence of a polecat was a refreshment .
Parsing [sent. 6189 len. 21]: We found many who had eaten the dorian , and they all spoke of it with a sort of rapture .
Parsing [sent. 6190 len. 64]: They said that if you could hold your nose until the fruit was in your mouth a sacred joy would suffuse you from head to foot that would make you oblivious to the smell of the rind , but that if your grip slipped and you caught the smell of the rind before the fruit was in your mouth , you would faint .
Parsing [sent. 6191 len. 8]: There is a fortune in that rind .
Parsing [sent. 6192 len. 14]: Some day somebody will import it into Europe and sell it for cheese .
Parsing [sent. 6193 len. 6]: Benares was not a disappointment .
Parsing [sent. 6194 len. 8]: It justified its reputation as a curiosity .
Parsing [sent. 6195 len. 15]: It is on high ground , and overhangs a grand curve of the Ganges .
Parsing [sent. 6196 len. 30]: It is a vast mass of building , compactly crusting a hill , and is cloven in all directions by an intricate confusion of cracks which stand for streets .
Parsing [sent. 6197 len. 21]: Tall , slim minarets and beflagged temple-spires rise out of it and give it picturesqueness , viewed from the river .
Parsing [sent. 6198 len. 28]: The city is as busy as an ant-hill , and the hurly-burly of human life swarming along the web of narrow streets reminds one of the ants .
Parsing [sent. 6199 len. 45]: The sacred cow swarms along , too , and goes whither she pleases , and takes toll of the grain-shops , and is very much in the way , and is a good deal of a nuisance , since she must not be molested .
Parsing [sent. 6200 len. 27]: Benares is older than history , older than tradition , older even than legend , and looks twice as old as all of them put together .
Parsing [sent. 6201 len. 32]: From a Hindoo statement quoted in Rev. Mr. Parker 's compact and lucid Guide to Benares , I find that the site of the town was the beginning-place of the Creation .
Parsing [sent. 6202 len. 28]: It was merely an upright `` lingam , '' at first , no larger than a stove-pipe , and stood in the midst of a shoreless ocean .
Parsing [sent. 6203 len. 9]: This was the work of the God Vishnu .
Parsing [sent. 6204 len. 14]: Later he spread the lingam out till its surface was ten miles across .
Parsing [sent. 6205 len. 19]: Still it was not large enough for the business ; therefore he presently built the globe around it .
Parsing [sent. 6206 len. 9]: Benares is thus the center of the earth .
Parsing [sent. 6207 len. 6]: This is considered an advantage .
Parsing [sent. 6208 len. 12]: It has had a tumultuous history , both materially and spiritually .
Parsing [sent. 6209 len. 53]: It started Brahminically , many ages ago ; then by and by Buddha came in recent times 2,500 years ago , and after that it was Buddhist during many centuries -- twelve , perhaps -- but the Brahmins got the upper hand again , then , and have held it ever since .
Parsing [sent. 6210 len. 26]: It is unspeakably sacred in Hindoo eyes , and is as unsanitary as it is sacred , and smells like the rind of the dorian .
Parsing [sent. 6211 len. 20]: It is the headquarters of the Brahmin faith , and one-eighth of the population are priests of that church .
Parsing [sent. 6212 len. 16]: But it is not an overstock , for they have all India as a prey .
Parsing [sent. 6213 len. 26]: All India flocks thither on pilgrimage , and pours its savings into the pockets of the priests in a generous stream , which never fails .
Parsing [sent. 6214 len. 26]: A priest with a good stand on the shore of the Ganges is much better off than the sweeper of the best crossing in London .
Parsing [sent. 6215 len. 10]: A good stand is worth a world of money .
Parsing [sent. 6216 len. 58]: The holy proprietor of it sits under his grand spectacular umbrella and blesses people all his life , and collects his commission , and grows fat and rich ; and the stand passes from father to son , down and down and down through the ages , and remains a permanent and lucrative estate in the family .
Parsing [sent. 6217 len. 52]: As Mr. Parker suggests , it can become a subject of dispute , at one time or another , and then the matter will be settled , not by prayer and fasting and consultations with Vishnu , but by the intervention of a much more puissant power -- an English court .
Parsing [sent. 6218 len. 20]: In Bombay I was told by an American missionary that in India there are 640 Protestant missionaries at work .
Parsing [sent. 6219 len. 17]: At first it seemed an immense force , but of course that was a thoughtless idea .
Parsing [sent. 6220 len. 36]: One missionary to 500,000 natives -- no , that is not a force ; it is the reverse of it ; 640 marching against an intrenched camp of 300,000,000 -- the odds are too great .
Parsing [sent. 6221 len. 19]: A force of 640 in Benares alone would have its hands over-full with 8,000 Brahmin priests for adversary .
Parsing [sent. 6222 len. 27]: Missionaries need to be well equipped with hope and confidence , and this equipment they seem to have always had in all parts of the world .
Parsing [sent. 6223 len. 5]: Mr. Parker has it .
Parsing [sent. 6224 len. 20]: It enables him to get a favorable outlook out of statistics which might add up differently with other mathematicians .
Parsing [sent. 6225 len. 23]: For instance : `` During the past few years competent observers declare that the number of pilgrims to Benares has increased . ''
Parsing [sent. 6226 len. 32]: And then he adds up this fact and gets this conclusion : `` But the revival , if so it may be called , has in it the marks of death .
Parsing [sent. 6227 len. 9]: It is a spasmodic struggle before dissolution . ''
Parsing [sent. 6228 len. 21]: In this world we have seen the Roman Catholic power dying , upon these same terms , for many centuries .
Parsing [sent. 6229 len. 25]: Many a time we have gotten all ready for the funeral and found it postponed again , on account of the weather or something .
Parsing [sent. 6230 len. 23]: Taught by experience , we ought not to put on our things for this Brahminical one till we see the procession move .
Parsing [sent. 6231 len. 17]: Apparently one of the most uncertain things in the world is the funeral of a religion .
Parsing [sent. 6232 len. 28]: I should have been glad to acquire some sort of idea of Hindoo theology , but the difficulties were too great , the matter was too intricate .
Parsing [sent. 6233 len. 13]: Even the mere A , B , C of it is baffling .
Parsing [sent. 6234 len. 51]: There is a trinity -- Brahma , Shiva , and Vishnu -- independent powers , apparently , though one can not feel quite sure of that , because in one of the temples there is an image where an attempt has been made to concentrate the three in one person .
Parsing [sent. 6235 len. 19]: The three have other names and plenty of them , and this makes confusion in one 's mind .
Parsing [sent. 6236 len. 17]: The three have wives and the wives have several names , and this increases the confusion .
Parsing [sent. 6237 len. 19]: There are children , the children have many names , and thus the confusion goes on and on .
Parsing [sent. 6238 len. 25]: It is not worth while to try to get any grip upon the cloud of minor gods , there are too many of them .
Parsing [sent. 6239 len. 32]: It is even a justifiable economy to leave Brahma , the chiefest god of all , out of your studies , for he seems to cut no great figure in India .
Parsing [sent. 6240 len. 17]: The vast bulk of the national worship is lavished upon Shiva and Vishnu and their families .
Parsing [sent. 6241 len. 22]: Shiva 's symbol -- the `` lingam '' with which Vishnu began the Creation -- is worshiped by everybody , apparently .
Parsing [sent. 6242 len. 8]: It is the commonest object in Benares .
Parsing [sent. 6243 len. 23]: It is on view everywhere , it is garlanded with flowers , offerings are made to it , it suffers no neglect .
Parsing [sent. 6244 len. 18]: Commonly it is an upright stone , shaped like a thimble -- sometimes like an elongated thimble .
Parsing [sent. 6245 len. 10]: This priapus-worship , then , is older than history .
Parsing [sent. 6246 len. 14]: Mr. Parker says that the lingams in Benares `` outnumber the inhabitants . ''
Parsing [sent. 6247 len. 8]: In Benares there are many Mohammedan mosques .
Parsing [sent. 6248 len. 21]: There are Hindoo temples without number -- these quaintly shaped and elaborately sculptured little stone jugs crowd all the lanes .
Parsing [sent. 6249 len. 14]: The Ganges itself and every individual drop of water in it are temples .
Parsing [sent. 6250 len. 19]: Religion , then , is the business of Benares , just as gold-production is the business of Johannesburg .
Parsing [sent. 6251 len. 23]: Other industries count for nothing as compared with the vast and all-absorbing rush and drive and boom of the town 's specialty .
Parsing [sent. 6252 len. 8]: Benares is the sacredest of sacred cities .
Parsing [sent. 6253 len. 27]: The moment you step across the sharply-defined line which separates it from the rest of the globe , you stand upon ineffably and unspeakably holy ground .
Parsing [sent. 6254 len. 36]: Mr. Parker says : `` It is impossible to convey any adequate idea of the intense feelings of veneration and affection with which the pious Hindoo regards ` Holy Kashi ' -LRB- Benares -RRB- . ''
Parsing [sent. 6255 len. 53]: And then he gives you this vivid and moving picture : `` Let a Hindoo regiment be marched through the district , and as soon as they cross the line and enter the limits of the holy place they rend the air with cries of ` Kashi ji ki jai -- jai !
Parsing [sent. 6256 len. 4]: -LRB- Holy Kashi !
Parsing [sent. 6257 len. 4]: Hail to thee !
Parsing [sent. 6258 len. 2]: Hail !
Parsing [sent. 6259 len. 2]: Hail !
Parsing [sent. 6260 len. 4]: Hail -RRB- ' .
Parsing [sent. 6261 len. 55]: The weary pilgrim scarcely able to stand , with age and weakness , blinded by the dust and heat , and almost dead with fatigue , crawls out of the oven-like railway carriage and as soon as his feet touch the ground he lifts up his withered hands and utters the same pious exclamation .
Parsing [sent. 6262 len. 51]: Let a European in some distant city in casual talk in the bazar mention the fact that he has lived at Benares , and at once voices will be raised to call down blessings on his head , for a dweller in Benares is of all men most blessed . ''
Parsing [sent. 6263 len. 11]: It makes our own religious enthusiasm seem pale and cold .
Parsing [sent. 6264 len. 32]: Inasmuch as the life of religion is in the heart , not the head , Mr. Parker 's touching picture seems to promise a sort of indefinite postponement of that funeral .
Parsing [sent. 6265 len. 3]: CHAPTER LI .
Parsing [sent. 6266 len. 21]: Let me make the superstitions of a nation and I care not who makes its laws or its songs either .
Parsing [sent. 6267 len. 9]: -- Pudd ` nhead Wilson 's New Calendar .
Parsing [sent. 6268 len. 60]: Yes , the city of Benares is in effect just a big church , a religious hive , whose every cell is a temple , a shrine or a mosque , and whose every conceivable earthly and heavenly good is procurable under one roof , so to speak -- a sort of Army and Navy Stores , theologically stocked .
Parsing [sent. 6269 len. 27]: I will make out a little itinerary for the pilgrim ; then you will see how handy the system is , how convenient , how comprehensive .
Parsing [sent. 6270 len. 20]: If you go to Benares with a serious desire to spiritually benefit yourself , you will find it valuable .
Parsing [sent. 6271 len. 27]: I got some of the facts from conversations with the Rev. Mr. Parker and the others from his Guide to Benares ; they are therefore trustworthy .
Parsing [sent. 6272 len. 2]: 1 .
Parsing [sent. 6273 len. 2]: Purification .
Parsing [sent. 6274 len. 21]: At sunrise you must go down to the Ganges and bathe , pray , and drink some of the water .
Parsing [sent. 6275 len. 7]: This is for your general purification .
Parsing [sent. 6276 len. 2]: 2 .
Parsing [sent. 6277 len. 4]: Protection against Hunger .
Parsing [sent. 6278 len. 14]: Next , you must fortify yourself against the sorrowful earthly ill just named .
Parsing [sent. 6279 len. 14]: This you will do by worshiping for a moment in the Cow Temple .
Parsing [sent. 6280 len. 37]: By the door of it you will find an image of Ganesh , son of Shiva ; it has the head of an elephant on a human body ; its face and hands are of silver .
Parsing [sent. 6281 len. 33]: You will worship it a little , and pass on , into a covered veranda , where you will find devotees reciting from the sacred books , with the help of instructors .
Parsing [sent. 6282 len. 11]: In this place are groups of rude and dismal idols .
Parsing [sent. 6283 len. 31]: You may contribute something for their support ; then pass into the temple , a grim and stenchy place , for it is populous with sacred cows and with beggars .
Parsing [sent. 6284 len. 43]: You will give something to the beggars , and `` reverently kiss the tails '' of such cows as pass along , for these cows are peculiarly holy , and this act of worship will secure you from hunger for the day .
Parsing [sent. 6285 len. 2]: 3 .
Parsing [sent. 6286 len. 8]: `` The Poor Man 's Friend . ''
Parsing [sent. 6287 len. 7]: You will next worship this god .
Parsing [sent. 6288 len. 39]: He is at the bottom of a stone cistern in the temple of Dalbhyeswar , under the shade of a noble peepul tree on the bluff overlooking the Ganges , so you must go back to the river .
Parsing [sent. 6289 len. 23]: The Poor Man 's Friend is the god of material prosperity in general , and the god of the rain in particular .
Parsing [sent. 6290 len. 13]: You will secure material prosperity , or both , by worshiping him .
Parsing [sent. 6291 len. 27]: He is Shiva , under a new alias , and he abides in the bottom of that cistern , in the form of a stone lingam .
Parsing [sent. 6292 len. 19]: You pour Ganges water over him , and in return for this homage you get the promised benefits .
Parsing [sent. 6293 len. 29]: If there is any delay about the rain , you must pour water in until the cistern is full ; the rain will then be sure to come .
Parsing [sent. 6294 len. 2]: 4 .
Parsing [sent. 6295 len. 2]: Fever .
Parsing [sent. 6296 len. 19]: At the Kedar Ghat you will find a long flight of stone steps leading down to the river .
Parsing [sent. 6297 len. 10]: Half way down is a tank filled with sewage .
Parsing [sent. 6298 len. 9]: Drink as much of it as you want .
Parsing [sent. 6299 len. 5]: It is for fever .
Parsing [sent. 6300 len. 2]: 5 .
Parsing [sent. 6301 len. 2]: Smallpox .
Parsing [sent. 6302 len. 9]: Go straight from there to the central Ghat .
Parsing [sent. 6303 len. 24]: At its upstream end you will find a small whitewashed building , which is a temple sacred to Sitala , goddess of smallpox .
Parsing [sent. 6304 len. 14]: Her under-study is there -- a rude human figure behind a brass screen .
Parsing [sent. 6305 len. 11]: You will worship this for reasons to be furnished presently .
Parsing [sent. 6306 len. 2]: 6 .
Parsing [sent. 6307 len. 5]: The Well of Fate .
Parsing [sent. 6308 len. 14]: For certain reasons you will next go and do homage at this well .
Parsing [sent. 6309 len. 13]: You will find it in the Dandpan Temple , in the city .
Parsing [sent. 6310 len. 14]: The sunlight falls into it from a square hole in the masonry above .
Parsing [sent. 6311 len. 15]: You will approach it with awe , for your life is now at stake .
Parsing [sent. 6312 len. 7]: You will bend over and look .
Parsing [sent. 6313 len. 21]: If the fates are propitious , you will see your face pictured in the water far down in the well .
Parsing [sent. 6314 len. 20]: If matters have been otherwise ordered , a sudden cloud will mask the sun and you will see nothing .
Parsing [sent. 6315 len. 11]: This means that you have not six months to live .
Parsing [sent. 6316 len. 16]: If you are already at the point of death , your circumstances are now serious .
Parsing [sent. 6317 len. 7]: There is no time to lose .
Parsing [sent. 6318 len. 11]: Let this world go , arrange for the next one .
Parsing [sent. 6319 len. 13]: Handily situated , at your very elbow , is opportunity for this .
Parsing [sent. 6320 len. 24]: You turn and worship the image of Maha Kal , the Great Fate , and happiness in the life to come is secured .
Parsing [sent. 6321 len. 25]: If there is breath in your body yet , you should now make an effort to get a further lease of the present life .
Parsing [sent. 6322 len. 5]: You have a chance .
Parsing [sent. 6323 len. 21]: There is a chance for everything in this admirably stocked and wonderfully systemized Spiritual and Temporal Army and Navy Store .
Parsing [sent. 6324 len. 9]: You must get yourself carried to the 7 .
Parsing [sent. 6325 len. 5]: Well of Long Life .
Parsing [sent. 6326 len. 22]: This is within the precincts of the mouldering and venerable Briddhkal Temple , which is one of the oldest in Benares .
Parsing [sent. 6327 len. 32]: You pass in by a stone image of the monkey god , Hanuman , and there , among the ruined courtyards , you will find a shallow pool of stagnant sewage .
Parsing [sent. 6328 len. 50]: It smells like the best limburger cheese , and is filthy with the washings of rotting lepers , but that is nothing , bathe in it ; bathe in it gratefully and worshipfully , for this is the Fountain of Youth ; these are the Waters of Long Life .
Parsing [sent. 6329 len. 47]: Your gray hairs will disappear , and with them your wrinkles and your rheumatism , the burdens of care and the weariness of age , and you will come out young , fresh , elastic , and full of eagerness for the new race of life .
Parsing [sent. 6330 len. 20]: Now will come flooding upon you the manifold desires that haunt the dear dreams of the morning of life .
Parsing [sent. 6331 len. 9]: You will go whither you will find 8 .
Parsing [sent. 6332 len. 4]: Fulfillment of Desire .
Parsing [sent. 6333 len. 17]: To wit , to the Kameshwar Temple , sacred to Shiva as the Lord of Desires .
Parsing [sent. 6334 len. 5]: Arrange for yours there .
Parsing [sent. 6335 len. 26]: And if you like to look at idols among the pack and jam of temples , there you will find enough to stock a museum .
Parsing [sent. 6336 len. 32]: You will begin to commit sins now with a fresh , new vivacity ; therefore , it will be well to go frequently to a place where you can get 9 .
Parsing [sent. 6337 len. 5]: Temporary Cleansing from Sin .
Parsing [sent. 6338 len. 10]: To wit , to the Well of the Earring .
Parsing [sent. 6339 len. 15]: You must approach this with the profoundest reverence , for it is unutterably sacred .
Parsing [sent. 6340 len. 25]: It is , indeed , the most sacred place in Benares , the very Holy of Holies , in the estimation of the people .
Parsing [sent. 6341 len. 15]: It is a railed tank , with stone stairways leading down to the water .
Parsing [sent. 6342 len. 6]: The water is not clean .
Parsing [sent. 6343 len. 15]: Of course it could not be , for people are always bathing in it .
Parsing [sent. 6344 len. 31]: As long as you choose to stand and look , you will see the files of sinners descending and ascending -- descending soiled with sin , ascending purged from it .
Parsing [sent. 6345 len. 31]: `` The liar , the thief , the murderer , and the adulterer may here wash and be clean , '' says the Rev. Mr. Parker , in his book .
Parsing [sent. 6346 len. 3]: Very well .
Parsing [sent. 6347 len. 37]: I know Mr. Parker , and I believe it ; but if anybody else had said it , I should consider him a person who had better go down in the tank and take another wash .
Parsing [sent. 6348 len. 7]: The god Vishnu dug this tank .
Parsing [sent. 6349 len. 12]: He had nothing to dig with but his `` discus . ''
Parsing [sent. 6350 len. 42]: I do not know what a discus is , but I know it is a poor thing to dig tanks with , because , by the time this one was finished , it was full of sweat -- Vishnu 's sweat .
Parsing [sent. 6351 len. 35]: He constructed the site that Benares stands on , and afterward built the globe around it , and thought nothing of it , yet sweated like that over a little thing like this tank .
Parsing [sent. 6352 len. 7]: One of these statements is doubtful .
Parsing [sent. 6353 len. 47]: I do not know which one it is , but I think it difficult not to believe that a god who could build a world around Benares would not be intelligent enough to build it around the tank too , and not have to dig it .
Parsing [sent. 6354 len. 23]: Youth , long life , temporary purification from sin , salvation through propitiation of the Great Fate -- these are all good .
Parsing [sent. 6355 len. 7]: But you must do something more .
Parsing [sent. 6356 len. 4]: You must 10 .
Parsing [sent. 6357 len. 4]: Make Salvation Sure .
Parsing [sent. 6358 len. 5]: There are several ways .
Parsing [sent. 6359 len. 15]: To get drowned in the Ganges is one , but that is not pleasant .
Parsing [sent. 6360 len. 29]: To die within the limits of Benares is another ; but that is a risky one , because you might be out of town when your time came .
Parsing [sent. 6361 len. 12]: The best one of all is the Pilgrimage Around the City .
Parsing [sent. 6362 len. 11]: You must walk ; also , you must go barefoot .
Parsing [sent. 6363 len. 27]: The tramp is forty-four miles , for the road winds out into the country a piece , and you will be marching five or six days .
Parsing [sent. 6364 len. 8]: But you will have plenty of company .
Parsing [sent. 6365 len. 53]: You will move with throngs and hosts of happy pilgrims whose radiant costumes will make the spectacle beautiful and whose glad songs and holy pans of triumph will banish your fatigues and cheer your spirit ; and at intervals there will be temples where you may sleep and be refreshed with food .
Parsing [sent. 6366 len. 14]: The pilgrimage completed , you have purchased salvation , and paid for it .
Parsing [sent. 6367 len. 10]: But you may not get it unless you 11 .
Parsing [sent. 6368 len. 5]: Get Your Redemption Recorded .
Parsing [sent. 6369 len. 46]: You can get this done at the Sakhi Binayak Temple , and it is best to do it , for otherwise you might not be able to prove that you had made the pilgrimage in case the matter should some day come to be disputed .
Parsing [sent. 6370 len. 12]: That temple is in a lane back of the Cow Temple .
Parsing [sent. 6371 len. 33]: Over the door is a red image of Ganesh of the elephant head , son and heir of Shiva , and Prince of Wales to the Theological Monarchy , so to speak .
Parsing [sent. 6372 len. 18]: Within is a god whose office it is to record your pilgrimage and be responsible for you .
Parsing [sent. 6373 len. 23]: You will not see him , but you will see a Brahmin who will attend to the matter and take the money .
Parsing [sent. 6374 len. 14]: If he should forget to collect the money , you can remind him .
Parsing [sent. 6375 len. 20]: HE knows that your salvation is now secure , but of course you would like to know it yourself .
Parsing [sent. 6376 len. 16]: You have nothing to do but go and pray , and pay at the 12 .
Parsing [sent. 6377 len. 7]: Well of the Knowledge of Salvation .
Parsing [sent. 6378 len. 8]: It is close to the Golden Temple .
Parsing [sent. 6379 len. 40]: There you will see , sculptured out of a single piece of black marble , a bull which is much larger than any living bull you have ever seen , and yet is not a good likeness after all .
Parsing [sent. 6380 len. 16]: And there also you will see a very uncommon thing -- an image of Shiva .
Parsing [sent. 6381 len. 24]: You have seen his lingam fifty thousand times already , but this is Shiva himself , and said to be a good likeness .
Parsing [sent. 6382 len. 5]: It has three eyes .
Parsing [sent. 6383 len. 12]: He is the only god in the firm that has three .
Parsing [sent. 6384 len. 46]: `` The well is covered by a fine canopy of stone supported by forty pillars , '' and around it you will find what you have already seen at almost every shrine you have visited in Benares , a mob of devout and eager pilgrims .
Parsing [sent. 6385 len. 57]: The sacred water is being ladled out to them ; with it comes to them the knowledge , clear , thrilling , absolute , that they are saved ; and you can see by their faces that there is one happiness in this world which is supreme , and to which no other joy is comparable .
Parsing [sent. 6386 len. 18]: You receive your water , you make your deposit , and now what more would you have ?
Parsing [sent. 6387 len. 8]: Gold , diamonds , power , fame ?
Parsing [sent. 6388 len. 16]: All in a single moment these things have withered to dirt , dust , ashes .
Parsing [sent. 6389 len. 9]: The world has nothing to give you now .
Parsing [sent. 6390 len. 6]: For you it is bankrupt .
Parsing [sent. 6391 len. 38]: I do not claim that the pilgrims do their acts of worship in the order and sequence above charted out in this Itinerary of mine , but I think logic suggests that they ought to do so .
Parsing [sent. 6392 len. 32]: Instead of a helter-skelter worship , we then have a definite starting-place , and a march which carries the pilgrim steadily forward by reasoned and logical progression to a definite goal .
Parsing [sent. 6393 len. 24]: Thus , his Ganges bath in the early morning gives him an appetite ; he kisses the cow-tails , and that removes it .
Parsing [sent. 6394 len. 45]: It is now business hours , and longings for material prosperity rise in his mind , and he goes and pours water over Shiva 's symbol ; this insures the prosperity , but also brings on a rain , which gives him a fever .
Parsing [sent. 6395 len. 24]: Then he drinks the sewage at the Kedar Ghat to cure the fever ; it cures the fever but gives him the smallpox .
Parsing [sent. 6396 len. 24]: He wishes to know how it is going to turn out ; he goes to the Dandpan Temple and looks down the well .
Parsing [sent. 6397 len. 10]: A clouded sun shows him that death is near .
Parsing [sent. 6398 len. 39]: Logically his best course for the present , since he can not tell at what moment he may die , is to secure a happy hereafter ; this he does , through the agency of the Great Fate .
Parsing [sent. 6399 len. 26]: He is safe , now , for heaven ; his next move will naturally be to keep out of it as long as he can .
Parsing [sent. 6400 len. 26]: Therefore he goes to the Briddhkal Temple and secures Youth and long life by bathing in a puddle of leper-pus which would kill a microbe .
Parsing [sent. 6401 len. 36]: Logically , Youth has re-equipped him for sin and with the disposition to commit it ; he will naturally go to the fane which is consecrated to the Fulfillment of Desires , and make arrangements .
Parsing [sent. 6402 len. 26]: Logically , he will now go to the Well of the Earring from time to time to unload and freshen up for further banned enjoyments .
Parsing [sent. 6403 len. 28]: But first and last and all the time he is human , and therefore in his reflective intervals he will always be speculating in `` futures . ''
Parsing [sent. 6404 len. 47]: He will make the Great Pilgrimage around the city and so make his salvation absolutely sure ; he will also have record made of it , so that it may remain absolutely sure and not be forgotten or repudiated in the confusion of the Final Settlement .
Parsing [sent. 6405 len. 93]: Logically , also , he will wish to have satisfying and tranquilizing personal knowledge that that salvation is secure ; therefore he goes to the Well of the Knowledge of Salvation , adds that completing detail , and then goes about his affairs serene and content ; serene and content , for he is now royally endowed with an advantage which no religion in this world could give him but his own ; for henceforth he may commit as many million sins as he wants to and nothing can come of it .
Parsing [sent. 6406 len. 23]: Thus the system , properly and logically ordered , is neat , compact , clearly defined , and covers the whole ground .
Parsing [sent. 6407 len. 30]: I desire to recommend it to such as find the other systems too difficult , exacting , and irksome for the uses of this fretful brief life of ours .
Parsing [sent. 6408 len. 9]: However , let me not deceive any one .
Parsing [sent. 6409 len. 6]: My Itinerary lacks a detail .
Parsing [sent. 6410 len. 6]: I must put it in .
Parsing [sent. 6411 len. 49]: The truth is , that after the pilgrim has faithfully followed the requirements of the Itinerary through to the end and has secured his salvation and also the personal knowledge of that fact , there is still an accident possible to him which can annul the whole thing .
Parsing [sent. 6412 len. 34]: If he should ever cross to the other side of the Ganges and get caught out and die there he would at once come to life again in the form of an ass .
Parsing [sent. 6413 len. 11]: Think of that , after all this trouble and expense .
Parsing [sent. 6414 len. 10]: You see how capricious and uncertain salvation is there .
Parsing [sent. 6415 len. 15]: The Hindoo has a childish and unreasoning aversion to being turned into an ass .
Parsing [sent. 6416 len. 7]: It is hard to tell why .
Parsing [sent. 6417 len. 17]: One could properly expect an ass to have an aversion to being turned into a Hindoo .
Parsing [sent. 6418 len. 20]: One could understand that he could lose dignity by it ; also self-respect , and nine-tenths of his intelligence .
Parsing [sent. 6419 len. 18]: But the Hindoo changed into an ass would n't lose anything , unless you count his religion .
Parsing [sent. 6420 len. 44]: And he would gain much -- release from his slavery to two million gods and twenty million priests , fakeers , holy mendicants , and other sacred bacilli ; he would escape the Hindoo hell ; he would also escape the Hindoo heaven .
Parsing [sent. 6421 len. 22]: These are advantages which the Hindoo ought to consider ; then he would go over and die on the other side .
Parsing [sent. 6422 len. 6]: Benares is a religious Vesuvius .
Parsing [sent. 6423 len. 29]: In its bowels the theological forces have been heaving and tossing , rumbling , thundering and quaking , boiling , and weltering and flaming and smoking for ages .
Parsing [sent. 6424 len. 18]: But a little group of missionaries have taken post at its base , and they have hopes .
Parsing [sent. 6425 len. 30]: There are the Baptist Missionary Society , the Church Missionary Society , the London Missionary Society , the Wesleyan Missionary Society , and the Zenana Bible and Medical Mission .
Parsing [sent. 6426 len. 15]: They have schools , and the principal work seems to be among the children .
Parsing [sent. 6427 len. 29]: And no doubt that part of the work prospers best , for grown people everywhere are always likely to cling to the religion they were brought up in .
Parsing [sent. 6428 len. 3]: CHAPTER LII .
Parsing [sent. 6429 len. 9]: Wrinkles should merely indicate where smiles have been .
Parsing [sent. 6430 len. 9]: -- Pudd ` nhead Wilson 's New Calendar .
Parsing [sent. 6431 len. 18]: In one of those Benares temples we saw a devotee working for salvation in a curious way .
Parsing [sent. 6432 len. 24]: He had a huge wad of clay beside him and was making it up into little wee gods no bigger than carpet tacks .
Parsing [sent. 6433 len. 17]: He stuck a grain of rice into each -- to represent the lingam , I think .
Parsing [sent. 6434 len. 18]: He turned them out nimbly , for he had had long practice and had acquired great facility .
Parsing [sent. 6435 len. 15]: Every day he made 2,000 gods , then threw them into the holy Ganges .
Parsing [sent. 6436 len. 17]: This act of homage brought him the profound homage of the pious -- also their coppers .
Parsing [sent. 6437 len. 17]: He had a sure living here , and was earning a high place in the hereafter .
Parsing [sent. 6438 len. 10]: The Ganges front is the supreme show-place of Benares .
Parsing [sent. 6439 len. 133]: Its tall bluffs are solidly caked from water to summit , along a stretch of three miles , with a splendid jumble of massive and picturesque masonry , a bewildering and beautiful confusion of stone platforms , temples , stair-flights , rich and stately palaces -- nowhere a break , nowhere a glimpse of the bluff itself ; all the long face of it is compactly walled from sight by this crammed perspective of platforms , soaring stairways , sculptured temples , majestic palaces , softening away into the distances ; and there is movement , motion , human life everywhere , and brilliantly costumed -- streaming in rainbows up and down the lofty stairways , and massed in metaphorical flower-gardens on the miles of great platforms at the river 's edge .
Parsing [sent. 6440 len. 10]: All this masonry , all this architecture represents piety .
Parsing [sent. 6441 len. 46]: The palaces were built by native princes whose homes , as a rule , are far from Benares , but who go there from time to time to refresh their souls with the sight and touch of the Ganges , the river of their idolatry .
Parsing [sent. 6442 len. 32]: The stairways are records of acts of piety ; the crowd of costly little temples are tokens of money spent by rich men for present credit and hope of future reward .
Parsing [sent. 6443 len. 38]: Apparently , the rich Christian who spends large sums upon his religion is conspicuous with us , by his rarity , but the rich Hindoo who does n't spend large sums upon his religion is seemingly non-existent .
Parsing [sent. 6444 len. 19]: With us the poor spend money on their religion , but they keep back some to live on .
Parsing [sent. 6445 len. 14]: Apparently , in India , the poor bankrupt themselves daily for their religion .
Parsing [sent. 6446 len. 51]: The rich Hindoo can afford his pious outlays ; he gets much glory for his spendings , yet keeps back a sufficiency of his income for temporal purposes ; but the poor Hindoo is entitled to compassion , for his spendings keep him poor , yet get him no glory .
Parsing [sent. 6447 len. 122]: We made the usual trip up and down the river , seated in chairs under an awning on the deck of the usual commodious hand-propelled ark ; made it two or three times , and could have made it with increasing interest and enjoyment many times more ; for , of course , the palaces and temples would grow more and more beautiful every time one saw them , for that happens with all such things ; also , I think one would not get tired of the bathers , nor their costumes , nor of their ingenuities in getting out of them and into them again without exposing too much bronze , nor of their devotional gesticulations and absorbed bead-tellings .
Parsing [sent. 6448 len. 19]: But I should get tired of seeing them wash their mouths with that dreadful water and drink it .
Parsing [sent. 6449 len. 16]: In fact , I did get tired of it , and very early , too .
Parsing [sent. 6450 len. 44]: At one place where we halted for a while , the foul gush from a sewer was making the water turbid and murky all around , and there was a random corpse slopping around in it that had floated down from up country .
Parsing [sent. 6451 len. 34]: Ten steps below that place stood a crowd of men , women , and comely young maidens waist deep in the water-and they were scooping it up in their hands and drinking it .
Parsing [sent. 6452 len. 14]: Faith can certainly do wonders , and this is an instance of it .
Parsing [sent. 6453 len. 26]: Those people were not drinking that fearful stuff to assuage thirst , but in order to purify their souls and the interior of their bodies .
Parsing [sent. 6454 len. 20]: According to their creed , the Ganges water makes everything pure that it touches -- instantly and utterly pure .
Parsing [sent. 6455 len. 36]: The sewer water was not an offence to them , the corpse did not revolt them ; the sacred water had touched both , and both were now snow-pure , and could defile no one .
Parsing [sent. 6456 len. 16]: The memory of that sight will always stay by me ; but not by request .
Parsing [sent. 6457 len. 11]: A word further concerning the nasty but all-purifying Ganges water .
Parsing [sent. 6458 len. 52]: When we went to Agra , by and by , we happened there just in time to be in at the birth of a marvel -- a memorable scientific discovery -- the discovery that in certain ways the foul and derided Ganges water is the most puissant purifier in the world !
Parsing [sent. 6459 len. 20]: This curious fact , as I have said , had just been added to the treasury of modern science .
Parsing [sent. 6460 len. 27]: It had long been noted as a strange thing that while Benares is often afflicted with the cholera she does not spread it beyond her borders .
Parsing [sent. 6461 len. 7]: This could not be accounted for .
Parsing [sent. 6462 len. 20]: Mr. Henkin , the scientist in the employ of the government of Agra , concluded to examine the water .
Parsing [sent. 6463 len. 9]: He went to Benares and made his tests .
Parsing [sent. 6464 len. 41]: He got water at the mouths of the sewers where they empty into the river at the bathing ghats ; a cubic centimetre of it contained millions of germs ; at the end of six hours they were all dead .
Parsing [sent. 6465 len. 38]: He caught a floating corpse , towed it to the shore , and from beside it he dipped up water that was swarming with cholera germs ; at the end of six hours they were all dead .
Parsing [sent. 6466 len. 25]: He added swarm after swarm of cholera germs to this water ; within the six hours they always died , to the last sample .
Parsing [sent. 6467 len. 47]: Repeatedly , he took pure well water which was barren of animal life , and put into it a few cholera germs ; they always began to propagate at once , and always within six hours they swarmed -- and were numberable by millions upon millions .
Parsing [sent. 6468 len. 40]: For ages and ages the Hindoos have had absolute faith that the water of the Ganges was absolutely pure , could not be defiled by any contact whatsoever , and infallibly made pure and clean whatsoever thing touched it .
Parsing [sent. 6469 len. 28]: They still believe it , and that is why they bathe in it and drink it , caring nothing for its seeming filthiness and the floating corpses .
Parsing [sent. 6470 len. 25]: The Hindoos have been laughed at , these many generations , but the laughter will need to modify itself a little from now on .
Parsing [sent. 6471 len. 14]: How did they find out the water 's secret in those ancient ages ?
Parsing [sent. 6472 len. 5]: Had they germ-scientists then ?
Parsing [sent. 6473 len. 5]: We do not know .
Parsing [sent. 6474 len. 15]: We only know that they had a civilization long before we emerged from savagery .
Parsing [sent. 6475 len. 18]: But to return to where I was before ; I was about to speak of the burning-ghat .
Parsing [sent. 6476 len. 10]: They do not burn fakeers -- those revered mendicants .
Parsing [sent. 6477 len. 24]: They are so holy that they can get to their place without that sacrament , provided they be consigned to the consecrating river .
Parsing [sent. 6478 len. 10]: We saw one carried to mid-stream and thrown overboard .
Parsing [sent. 6479 len. 10]: He was sandwiched between two great slabs of stone .
Parsing [sent. 6480 len. 14]: We lay off the cremation-ghat half an hour and saw nine corpses burned .
Parsing [sent. 6481 len. 18]: I should not wish to see any more of it , unless I might select the parties .
Parsing [sent. 6482 len. 37]: The mourners follow the bier through the town and down to the ghat ; then the bier-bearers deliver the body to some low-caste natives -- Doms -- and the mourners turn about and go back home .
Parsing [sent. 6483 len. 16]: I heard no crying and saw no tears , there was no ceremony of parting .
Parsing [sent. 6484 len. 17]: Apparently , these expressions of grief and affection are reserved for the privacy of the home .
Parsing [sent. 6485 len. 13]: The dead women came draped in red , the men in white .
Parsing [sent. 6486 len. 18]: They are laid in the water at the river 's edge while the pyre is being prepared .
Parsing [sent. 6487 len. 7]: The first subject was a man .
Parsing [sent. 6488 len. 38]: When the Doms unswathed him to wash him , he proved to be a sturdily built , well-nourished and handsome old gentleman , with not a sign about him to suggest that he had ever been ill .
Parsing [sent. 6489 len. 24]: Dry wood was brought and built up into a loose pile ; the corpse was laid upon it and covered over with fuel .
Parsing [sent. 6490 len. 33]: Then a naked holy man who was sitting on high ground a little distance away began to talk and shout with great energy , and he kept up this noise right along .
Parsing [sent. 6491 len. 12]: It may have been the funeral sermon , and probably was .
Parsing [sent. 6492 len. 17]: I forgot to say that one of the mourners remained behind when the others went away .
Parsing [sent. 6493 len. 29]: This was the dead man 's son , a boy of ten or twelve , brown and handsome , grave and self-possessed , and clothed in flowing white .
Parsing [sent. 6494 len. 8]: He was there to burn his father .
Parsing [sent. 6495 len. 33]: He was given a torch , and while he slowly walked seven times around the pyre the naked black man on the high ground poured out his sermon more clamorously than ever .
Parsing [sent. 6496 len. 38]: The seventh circuit completed , the boy applied the torch at his father 's head , then at his feet ; the flames sprang briskly up with a sharp crackling noise , and the lad went away .
Parsing [sent. 6497 len. 53]: Hindoos do not want daughters , because their weddings make such a ruinous expense ; but they want sons , so that at death they may have honorable exit from the world ; and there is no honor equal to the honor of having one 's pyre lighted by one 's son .
Parsing [sent. 6498 len. 16]: The father who dies sonless is in a grievous situation indeed , and is pitied .
Parsing [sent. 6499 len. 33]: Life being uncertain , the Hindoo marries while he is still a boy , in the hope that he will have a son ready when the day of his need shall come .
Parsing [sent. 6500 len. 12]: But if he have no son , he will adopt one .
Parsing [sent. 6501 len. 5]: This answers every purpose .
Parsing [sent. 6502 len. 10]: Meantime the corpse is burning , also several others .
Parsing [sent. 6503 len. 6]: It is a dismal business .
Parsing [sent. 6504 len. 29]: The stokers did not sit down in idleness , but moved briskly about , punching up the fires with long poles , and now and then adding fuel .
Parsing [sent. 6505 len. 33]: Sometimes they hoisted the half of a skeleton into the air , then slammed it down and beat it with the pole , breaking it up so that it would burn better .
Parsing [sent. 6506 len. 14]: They hoisted skulls up in the same way and banged and battered them .
Parsing [sent. 6507 len. 21]: The sight was hard to bear ; it would have been harder if the mourners had stayed to witness it .
Parsing [sent. 6508 len. 17]: I had but a moderate desire to see a cremation , so it was soon satisfied .
Parsing [sent. 6509 len. 24]: For sanitary reasons it would be well if cremation were universal ; but this form is revolting , and not to be recommended .
Parsing [sent. 6510 len. 16]: The fire used is sacred , of course -- for there is money in it .
Parsing [sent. 6511 len. 12]: Ordinary fire is forbidden ; there is no money in it .
Parsing [sent. 6512 len. 30]: I was told that this sacred fire is all furnished by one person , and that he has a monopoly of it and charges a good price for it .
Parsing [sent. 6513 len. 11]: Sometimes a rich mourner pays a thousand rupees for it .
Parsing [sent. 6514 len. 11]: To get to paradise from India is an expensive thing .
Parsing [sent. 6515 len. 16]: Every detail connected with the matter costs something , and helps to fatten a priest .
Parsing [sent. 6516 len. 16]: I suppose it is quite safe to conclude that that fire-bug is in holy orders .
Parsing [sent. 6517 len. 16]: Close to the cremation-ground stand a few time-worn stones which are remembrances of the suttee .
Parsing [sent. 6518 len. 42]: Each has a rough carving upon it , representing a man and a woman standing or walking hand in hand , and marks the spot where a widow went to her death by fire in the days when the suttee flourished .
Parsing [sent. 6519 len. 16]: Mr. Parker said that widows would burn themselves now if the government would allow it .
Parsing [sent. 6520 len. 30]: The family that can point to one of these little memorials and say : `` She who burned herself there was an ancestress of ours , '' is envied .
Parsing [sent. 6521 len. 6]: It is a curious people .
Parsing [sent. 6522 len. 13]: With them , all life seems to be sacred except human life .
Parsing [sent. 6523 len. 14]: Even the life of vermin is sacred , and must not be taken .
Parsing [sent. 6524 len. 25]: The good Jain wipes off a seat before using it , lest he cause the death of-some valueless insect by sitting down on it .
Parsing [sent. 6525 len. 22]: It grieves him to have to drink water , because the provisions in his stomach may not agree with the microbes .
Parsing [sent. 6526 len. 8]: Yet India invented Thuggery and the Suttee .
Parsing [sent. 6527 len. 8]: India is a hard country to understand .
Parsing [sent. 6528 len. 18]: We went to the temple of the Thug goddess , Bhowanee , or Kali , or Durga .
Parsing [sent. 6529 len. 7]: She has these names and others .
Parsing [sent. 6530 len. 12]: She is the only god to whom living sacrifices are made .
Parsing [sent. 6531 len. 6]: Goats are sacrificed to her .
Parsing [sent. 6532 len. 5]: Monkeys would be cheaper .
Parsing [sent. 6533 len. 9]: There are plenty of them about the place .
Parsing [sent. 6534 len. 16]: Being sacred , they make themselves very free , and scramble around wherever they please .
Parsing [sent. 6535 len. 19]: The temple and its porch are beautifully carved , but this is not the case with the idol .
Parsing [sent. 6536 len. 8]: Bhowanee is not pleasant to look at .
Parsing [sent. 6537 len. 16]: She has a silver face , and a projecting swollen tongue painted a deep red .
Parsing [sent. 6538 len. 7]: She wears a necklace of skulls .
Parsing [sent. 6539 len. 14]: In fact , none of the idols in Benares are handsome or attractive .
Parsing [sent. 6540 len. 9]: And what a swarm of them there is !
Parsing [sent. 6541 len. 20]: The town is a vast museum of idols -- and all of them crude , misshapen , and ugly .
Parsing [sent. 6542 len. 15]: They flock through one 's dreams at night , a wild mob of nightmares .
Parsing [sent. 6543 len. 34]: When you get tired of them in the temples and take a trip on the river , you find idol giants , flashily painted , stretched out side by side on the shore .
Parsing [sent. 6544 len. 16]: And apparently wherever there is room for one more lingam , a lingam is there .
Parsing [sent. 6545 len. 21]: If Vishnu had foreseen what his town was going to be , he would have called it Idolville or Lingamburg .
Parsing [sent. 6546 len. 24]: The most conspicuous feature of Benares is the pair of slender white minarets which tower like masts from the great Mosque of Aurangzeb .
Parsing [sent. 6547 len. 19]: They seem to be always in sight , from everywhere , those airy , graceful , inspiring things .
Parsing [sent. 6548 len. 21]: But masts is not the right word , for masts have a perceptible taper , while these minarets have not .
Parsing [sent. 6549 len. 28]: They are 142 feet high , and only 8 1/2 feet in diameter at the base , and 7 1/2 at the summit -- scarcely any taper at all .
Parsing [sent. 6550 len. 16]: These are the proportions of a candle ; and fair and fairylike candles these are .
Parsing [sent. 6551 len. 21]: Will be , anyway , some day , when the Christians inherit them and top them with the electric light .
Parsing [sent. 6552 len. 13]: There is a great view from up there -- a wonderful view .
Parsing [sent. 6553 len. 13]: A large gray monkey was part of it , and damaged it .
Parsing [sent. 6554 len. 6]: A monkey has no judgment .
Parsing [sent. 6555 len. 44]: This one was skipping about the upper great heights of the mosque -- skipping across empty yawning intervals which were almost too wide for him , and which he only just barely cleared , each time , by the skin of his teeth .
Parsing [sent. 6556 len. 14]: He got me so nervous that I could n't look at the view .
Parsing [sent. 6557 len. 9]: I could n't look at anything but him .
Parsing [sent. 6558 len. 34]: Every time he went sailing over one of those abysses my breath stood still , and when he grabbed for the perch he was going for , I grabbed too , in sympathy .
Parsing [sent. 6559 len. 17]: And he was perfectly indifferent , perfectly unconcerned , and I did all the panting myself .
Parsing [sent. 6560 len. 36]: He came within an ace of losing his life a dozen times , and I was so troubled about him that I would have shot him if I had had anything to do it with .
Parsing [sent. 6561 len. 7]: But I strongly recommend the view .
Parsing [sent. 6562 len. 29]: There is more monkey than view , and there is always going to be more monkey while that idiot survives , but what view you get is superb .
Parsing [sent. 6563 len. 16]: All Benares , the river , and the region round about are spread before you .
Parsing [sent. 6564 len. 10]: Take a gun , and look at the view .
Parsing [sent. 6565 len. 9]: The next thing I saw was more reposeful .
Parsing [sent. 6566 len. 8]: It was a new kind of art .
Parsing [sent. 6567 len. 8]: It was a picture painted on water .
Parsing [sent. 6568 len. 7]: It was done by a native .
Parsing [sent. 6569 len. 38]: He sprinkled fine dust of various colors on the still surface of a basin of water , and out of these sprinklings a dainty and pretty picture gradually grew , a picture which a breath could destroy .
Parsing [sent. 6570 len. 36]: Somehow it was impressive , after so much browsing among massive and battered and decaying fanes that rest upon ruins , and those ruins upon still other ruins , and those upon still others again .
Parsing [sent. 6571 len. 13]: It was a sermon , an allegory , a symbol of Instability .
Parsing [sent. 6572 len. 15]: Those creations in stone were only a kind of water pictures , after all .
Parsing [sent. 6573 len. 16]: A prominent episode in the Indian career of Warren Hastings had Benares for its theater .
Parsing [sent. 6574 len. 13]: Wherever that extraordinary man set his foot , he left his mark .
Parsing [sent. 6575 len. 32]: He came to Benares in 1781 to collect a fine of L500 ,000 which he had levied upon its Rajah , Cheit Singh , on behalf of the East India Company .
Parsing [sent. 6576 len. 10]: Hastings was a long way from home and help .
Parsing [sent. 6577 len. 24]: There were , probably , not a dozen Englishmen within reach ; the Rajah was in his fort with his myriads around him .
Parsing [sent. 6578 len. 4]: But no matter .
Parsing [sent. 6579 len. 18]: From his little camp in a neighboring garden , Hastings sent a party to arrest the sovereign .
Parsing [sent. 6580 len. 23]: He sent on this daring mission a couple of hundred native soldiers -- sepoys -- under command of three young English lieutenants .
Parsing [sent. 6581 len. 7]: The Rajah submitted without a word .
Parsing [sent. 6582 len. 41]: The incident lights up the Indian situation electrically , and gives one a vivid sense of the strides which the English had made and the mastership they had acquired in the land since the date of Clive 's great victory .
Parsing [sent. 6583 len. 39]: In a quarter of a century , from being nobodies , and feared by none , they were become confessed lords and masters , feared by all , sovereigns included , and served by all , sovereigns included .
Parsing [sent. 6584 len. 8]: It makes the fairy tales sound true .
Parsing [sent. 6585 len. 21]: The English had not been afraid to enlist native soldiers to fight against their own people and keep them obedient .
Parsing [sent. 6586 len. 29]: And now Hastings was not afraid to come away out to this remote place with a handful of such soldiers and send them to arrest a native sovereign .
Parsing [sent. 6587 len. 10]: The lieutenants imprisoned the Rajah in his own fort .
Parsing [sent. 6588 len. 14]: It was beautiful , the pluckiness of it , the impudence of it .
Parsing [sent. 6589 len. 20]: The arrest enraged the Rajah 's people , and all Benares came storming about the place and threatening vengeance .
Parsing [sent. 6590 len. 16]: And yet , but for an accident , nothing important would have resulted , perhaps .
Parsing [sent. 6591 len. 32]: The mob found out a most strange thing , an almost incredible thing -- that this handful of soldiers had come on this hardy errand with empty guns and no ammunition .
Parsing [sent. 6592 len. 28]: This has been attributed to thoughtlessness , but it could hardly have been that , for in such large emergencies as this , intelligent people do think .
Parsing [sent. 6593 len. 32]: It must have been indifference , an over-confidence born of the proved submissiveness of the native character , when confronted by even one or two stern Britons in their war paint .
Parsing [sent. 6594 len. 18]: But , however that may be , it was a fatal discovery that the mob had made .
Parsing [sent. 6595 len. 23]: They were full of courage , now , and they broke into the fort and massacred the helpless soldiers and their officers .
Parsing [sent. 6596 len. 57]: Hastings escaped from Benares by night and got safely away , leaving the principality in a state of wild insurrection ; but he was back again within the month , and quieted it down in his prompt and virile way , and took the Rajah 's throne away from him and gave it to another man .
Parsing [sent. 6597 len. 11]: He was a capable kind of person was Warren Hastings .
Parsing [sent. 6598 len. 12]: This was the only time he was ever out of ammunition .
Parsing [sent. 6599 len. 54]: Some of his acts have left stains upon his name which can never be washed away , but he saved to England the Indian Empire , and that was the best service that was ever done to the Indians themselves , those wretched heirs of a hundred centuries of pitiless oppression and abuse .
Parsing [sent. 6600 len. 3]: CHAPTER LIII .
Parsing [sent. 6601 len. 10]: True irreverence is disrespect for another man 's god .
Parsing [sent. 6602 len. 9]: -- Pudd ` nhead Wilson 's New Calendar .
Parsing [sent. 6603 len. 11]: It was in Benares that I saw another living god .
Parsing [sent. 6604 len. 4]: That makes two .
Parsing [sent. 6605 len. 36]: I believe I have seen most of the greater and lesser wonders of the world , but I do not remember that any of them interested me so overwhelmingly as did that pair of gods .
Parsing [sent. 6606 len. 15]: When I try to account for this effect I find no difficulty about it .
Parsing [sent. 6607 len. 37]: I find that , as a rule , when a thing is a wonder to us it is not because of what we see in it , but because of what others have seen in it .
Parsing [sent. 6608 len. 10]: We get almost all our wonders at second hand .
Parsing [sent. 6609 len. 85]: We are eager to see any celebrated thing -- and we never fail of our reward ; just the deep privilege of gazing upon an object which has stirred the enthusiasm or evoked the reverence or affection or admiration of multitudes of our race is a thing which we value ; we are profoundly glad that we have seen it , we are permanently enriched from having seen it , we would not part with the memory of that experience for a great price .
Parsing [sent. 6610 len. 10]: And yet that very spectacle may be the Taj .
Parsing [sent. 6611 len. 27]: You can not keep your enthusiasms down , you can not keep your emotions within bounds when that soaring bubble of marble breaks upon your view .
Parsing [sent. 6612 len. 72]: But these are not your enthusiasms and emotions -- they are the accumulated emotions and enthusiasms of a thousand fervid writers , who have been slowly and steadily storing them up in your heart day by day and year by year all your life ; and now they burst out in a flood and overwhelm you ; and you could not be a whit happier if they were your very own .
Parsing [sent. 6613 len. 25]: By and by you sober down , and then you perceive that you have been drunk on the smell of somebody else 's cork .
Parsing [sent. 6614 len. 28]: For ever and ever the memory of my distant first glimpse of the Taj will compensate me for creeping around the globe to have that great privilege .
Parsing [sent. 6615 len. 107]: But the Taj -- with all your inflation of delusive emotions , acquired at second-hand from people to whom in the majority of cases they were also delusions acquired at second-hand -- a thing which you fortunately did not think of or it might have made you doubtful of what you imagined were your own what is the Taj as a marvel , a spectacle and an uplifting and overpowering wonder , compared with a living , breathing , speaking personage whom several millions of human beings devoutly and sincerely and unquestioningly believe to be a God , and humbly and gratefully worship as a God ?
Parsing [sent. 6616 len. 10]: He was sixty years old when I saw him .
Parsing [sent. 6617 len. 9]: He is called Sri 108 Swami Bhaskarananda Saraswati .
Parsing [sent. 6618 len. 7]: That is one form of it .
Parsing [sent. 6619 len. 20]: I think that that is what you would call him in speaking to him -- because it is short .
Parsing [sent. 6620 len. 20]: But you would use more of his name in addressing a letter to him ; courtesy would require this .
Parsing [sent. 6621 len. 21]: Even then you would not have to use all of it , but only this much : Sri 108 Matparamahansrzpairivrajakacharyaswamibhaskaranandasaraswati .
Parsing [sent. 6622 len. 16]: You do not put `` Esq. '' after it , for that is not necessary .
Parsing [sent. 6623 len. 16]: The word which opens the volley is itself a title of honor `` Sri . ''
Parsing [sent. 6624 len. 15]: The `` 108 '' stands for the rest of his names , I believe .
Parsing [sent. 6625 len. 36]: Vishnu has 108 names which he does not use in business , and no doubt it is a custom of gods and a privilege sacred to their order to keep 108 extra ones in stock .
Parsing [sent. 6626 len. 16]: Just the restricted name set down above is a handsome property , without the 108 .
Parsing [sent. 6627 len. 10]: By my count it has 58 letters in it .
Parsing [sent. 6628 len. 17]: This removes the long German words from competition ; they are permanently out of the race .
Parsing [sent. 6629 len. 21]: Sri 108 S. B. Saraswati has attained to what among the Hindoos is called the `` state of perfection . ''
Parsing [sent. 6630 len. 93]: It is a state which other Hindoos reach by being born again and again , and over and over again into this world , through one re-incarnation after another -- a tiresome long job covering centuries and decades of centuries , and one that is full of risks , too , like the accident of dying on the wrong side of the Ganges some time or other and waking up in the form of an ass , with a fresh start necessary and the numerous trips to be made all over again .
Parsing [sent. 6631 len. 15]: But in reaching perfection , Sri 108 S. B. S. has escaped all that .
Parsing [sent. 6632 len. 71]: He is no longer a part or a feature of this world ; his substance has changed , all earthiness has departed out of it ; he is utterly holy , utterly pure ; nothing can desecrate this holiness or stain this purity ; he is no longer of the earth , its concerns are matters foreign to him , its pains and griefs and troubles can not reach him .
Parsing [sent. 6633 len. 25]: When he dies , Nirvana is his ; he will be absorbed into the substance of the Supreme Deity and be at peace forever .
Parsing [sent. 6634 len. 30]: The Hindoo Scriptures point out how this state is to be reached , but it is only once in a thousand years , perhaps , that candidate accomplishes it .
Parsing [sent. 6635 len. 48]: This one has traversed the course required , stage by stage , from the beginning to the end , and now has nothing left to do but wait for the call which shall release him from a world in which he has now no part nor lot .
Parsing [sent. 6636 len. 17]: First , he passed through the student stage , and became learned in the holy books .
Parsing [sent. 6637 len. 12]: Next he became citizen , householder , husband , and father .
Parsing [sent. 6638 len. 7]: That was the required second stage .
Parsing [sent. 6639 len. 23]: Then -- like John Bunyan 's Christian he bade perpetual good-bye to his family , as required , and went wandering away .
Parsing [sent. 6640 len. 13]: He went far into the desert and served a term as hermit .
Parsing [sent. 6641 len. 30]: Next , he became a beggar , `` in accordance with the rites laid down in the Scriptures , '' and wandered about India eating the bread of mendicancy .
Parsing [sent. 6642 len. 13]: A quarter of a century ago he reached the stage of purity .
Parsing [sent. 6643 len. 20]: This needs no garment ; its symbol is nudity ; he discarded the waist-cloth which he had previously worn .
Parsing [sent. 6644 len. 26]: He could resume it now if he chose , for neither that nor any other contact can defile him ; but he does not choose .
Parsing [sent. 6645 len. 18]: There are several other stages , I believe , but I do not remember what they are .
Parsing [sent. 6646 len. 7]: But he has been through them .
Parsing [sent. 6647 len. 20]: Throughout the long course he was perfecting himself in holy learning , and writing commentaries upon the sacred books .
Parsing [sent. 6648 len. 13]: He was also meditating upon Brahma , and he does that now .
Parsing [sent. 6649 len. 11]: White marble relief-portraits of him are sold all about India .
Parsing [sent. 6650 len. 23]: He lives in a good house in a noble great garden in Benares , all meet and proper to his stupendous rank .
Parsing [sent. 6651 len. 10]: Necessarily he does not go abroad in the streets .
Parsing [sent. 6652 len. 13]: Deities would never be able to move about handily in any country .
Parsing [sent. 6653 len. 40]: If one whom we recognized and adored as a god should go abroad in our streets , and the day it was to happen were known , all traffic would be blocked and business would come to a standstill .
Parsing [sent. 6654 len. 37]: This god is comfortably housed , and yet modestly , all things considered , for if he wanted to live in a palace he would only need to speak and his worshipers would gladly build it .
Parsing [sent. 6655 len. 25]: Sometimes he sees devotees for a moment , and comforts them and blesses them , and they kiss his feet and go away happy .
Parsing [sent. 6656 len. 11]: Rank is nothing to him , he being a god .
Parsing [sent. 6657 len. 7]: To him all men are alike .
Parsing [sent. 6658 len. 13]: He sees whom he pleases and denies himself to whom he pleases .
Parsing [sent. 6659 len. 25]: Sometimes he sees a prince and denies himself to a pauper ; at other times he receives the pauper and turns the prince away .
Parsing [sent. 6660 len. 11]: However , he does not receive many of either class .
Parsing [sent. 6661 len. 10]: He has to husband his time for his meditations .
Parsing [sent. 6662 len. 12]: I think he would receive Rev. Mr. Parker at any time .
Parsing [sent. 6663 len. 31]: I think he is sorry for Mr. Parker , and I think Mr. Parker is sorry for him ; and no doubt this compassion is good for both of them .
Parsing [sent. 6664 len. 47]: When we arrived we had to stand around in the garden a little while and wait , and the outlook was not good , for he had been turning away Maharajas that day and receiving only the riff-raff , and we belonged in between , somewhere .
Parsing [sent. 6665 len. 17]: But presently , a servant came out saying it was all right , he was coming .
Parsing [sent. 6666 len. 20]: And sure enough , he came , and I saw him -- that object of the worship of millions .
Parsing [sent. 6667 len. 9]: It was a strange sensation , and thrilling .
Parsing [sent. 6668 len. 12]: I wish I could feel it stream through my veins again .
Parsing [sent. 6669 len. 17]: And yet , to me he was not a god , he was only a Taj .
Parsing [sent. 6670 len. 20]: The thrill was not my thrill , but had come to me secondhand from those invisible millions of believers .
Parsing [sent. 6671 len. 20]: By a hand-shake with their god I had ground-circuited their wire and got their monster battery 's whole charge .
Parsing [sent. 6672 len. 9]: He was tall and slender , indeed emaciated .
Parsing [sent. 6673 len. 17]: He had a clean cut and conspicuously intellectual face , and a deep and kindly eye .
Parsing [sent. 6674 len. 37]: He looked many years older than he really was , but much study and meditation and fasting and prayer , with the arid life he had led as hermit and beggar , could account for that .
Parsing [sent. 6675 len. 38]: He is wholly nude when he receives natives , of whatever rank they may be , but he had white cloth around his loins now , a concession to Mr. Parker 's European prejudices , no doubt .
Parsing [sent. 6676 len. 27]: As soon as I had sobered down a little we got along very well together , and I found him a most pleasant and friendly deity .
Parsing [sent. 6677 len. 21]: He had heard a deal about Chicago , and showed a quite remarkable interest in it , for a god .
Parsing [sent. 6678 len. 14]: It all came of the World 's Fair and the Congress of Religions .
Parsing [sent. 6679 len. 22]: If India knows about nothing else American , she knows about those , and will keep them in mind one while .
Parsing [sent. 6680 len. 26]: He proposed an exchange of autographs , a delicate attention which made me believe in him , but I had been having my doubts before .
Parsing [sent. 6681 len. 34]: He wrote his in his book , and I have a reverent regard for that book , though the words run from right to left , and so I ca n't read it .
Parsing [sent. 6682 len. 10]: It was a mistake to print in that way .
Parsing [sent. 6683 len. 25]: It contains his voluminous comments on the Hindoo holy writings , and if I could make them out I would try for perfection myself .
Parsing [sent. 6684 len. 9]: I gave him a copy of Huckleberry Finn .
Parsing [sent. 6685 len. 45]: I thought it might rest him up a little to mix it in along with his meditations on Brahma , for he looked tired , and I knew that if it did n't do him any good it would n't do him any harm .
Parsing [sent. 6686 len. 19]: He has a scholar meditating under him -- Mina Bahadur Rana -- but we did not see him .
Parsing [sent. 6687 len. 8]: He wears clothes and is very imperfect .
Parsing [sent. 6688 len. 15]: He has written a little pamphlet about his master , and I have that .
Parsing [sent. 6689 len. 17]: It contains a wood-cut of the master and himself seated on a rug in the garden .
Parsing [sent. 6690 len. 10]: The portrait of the master is very good indeed .
Parsing [sent. 6691 len. 31]: The posture is exactly that which Brahma himself affects , and it requires long arms and limber legs , and can be accumulated only by gods and the india-rubber man .
Parsing [sent. 6692 len. 15]: There is a life-size marble relief of Shri 108 , S.B.S. in the garden .
Parsing [sent. 6693 len. 8]: It represents him in this same posture .
Parsing [sent. 6694 len. 3]: Dear me !
Parsing [sent. 6695 len. 6]: It is a strange world .
Parsing [sent. 6696 len. 7]: Particularly the Indian division of it .
Parsing [sent. 6697 len. 37]: This pupil , Mina Bahadur Rana , is not a commonplace person , but a man of distinguished capacities and attainments , and , apparently , he had a fine worldly career in front of him .
Parsing [sent. 6698 len. 23]: He was serving the Nepal Government in a high capacity at the Court of the Viceroy of India , twenty years ago .
Parsing [sent. 6699 len. 16]: He was an able man , educated , a thinker , a man of property .
Parsing [sent. 6700 len. 60]: But the longing to devote himself to a religious life came upon him , and he resigned his place , turned his back upon the vanities and comforts of the world , and went away into the solitudes to live in a hut and study the sacred writings and meditate upon virtue and holiness and seek to attain them .
Parsing [sent. 6701 len. 7]: This sort of religion resembles ours .
Parsing [sent. 6702 len. 21]: Christ recommended the rich to give away all their property and follow Him in poverty , not in worldly comfort .
Parsing [sent. 6703 len. 25]: American and English millionaires do it every day , and thus verify and confirm to the world the tremendous forces that lie in religion .
Parsing [sent. 6704 len. 26]: Yet many people scoff at them for this loyalty to duty , and many will scoff at Mina Bahadur Rana and call him a crank .
Parsing [sent. 6705 len. 33]: Like many Christians of great character and intellect , he has made the study of his Scriptures and the writing of books of commentaries upon them the loving labor of his life .
Parsing [sent. 6706 len. 29]: Like them , he has believed that his was not an idle and foolish waste of his life , but a most worthy and honorable employment of it .
Parsing [sent. 6707 len. 28]: Yet , there are many people who will see in those others , men worthy of homage and deep reverence , but in him merely a crank .
Parsing [sent. 6708 len. 5]: But I shall not .
Parsing [sent. 6709 len. 5]: He has my reverence .
Parsing [sent. 6710 len. 22]: And I do n't offer it as a common thing and poor , but as an unusual thing and of value .
Parsing [sent. 6711 len. 15]: The ordinary reverence , the reverence defined and explained by the dictionary costs nothing .
Parsing [sent. 6712 len. 34]: Reverence for one 's own sacred things -- parents , religion , flag , laws , and respect for one 's own beliefs -- these are feelings which we can not even help .
Parsing [sent. 6713 len. 13]: They come natural to us ; they are involuntary , like breathing .
Parsing [sent. 6714 len. 8]: There is no personal merit in breathing .
Parsing [sent. 6715 len. 40]: But the reverence which is difficult , and which has personal merit in it , is the respect which you pay , without compulsion , to the political or religious attitude of a man whose beliefs are not yours .
Parsing [sent. 6716 len. 47]: You ca n't revere his gods or his politics , and no one expects you to do that , but you could respect his belief in them if you tried hard enough ; and you could respect him , too , if you tried hard enough .
Parsing [sent. 6717 len. 21]: But it is very , very difficult ; it is next to impossible , and so we hardly ever try .
Parsing [sent. 6718 len. 22]: If the man does n't believe as we do , we say he is a crank , and that settles it .
Parsing [sent. 6719 len. 14]: I mean it does nowadays , because now we ca n't burn him .
Parsing [sent. 6720 len. 38]: We are always canting about people 's `` irreverence , '' always charging this offense upon somebody or other , and thereby intimating that we are better than that person and do not commit that offense ourselves .
Parsing [sent. 6721 len. 39]: Whenever we do this we are in a lying attitude , and our speech is cant ; for none of us are reverent -- in a meritorious way ; deep down in our hearts we are all irreverent .
Parsing [sent. 6722 len. 14]: There is probably not a single exception to this rule in the earth .
Parsing [sent. 6723 len. 54]: There is probably not one person whose reverence rises higher than respect for his own sacred things ; and therefore , it is not a thing to boast about and be proud of , since the most degraded savage has that -- and , like the best of us , has nothing higher .
Parsing [sent. 6724 len. 26]: To speak plainly , we despise all reverences and all objects of reverence which are outside the pale of our own list of sacred things .
Parsing [sent. 6725 len. 24]: And yet , with strange inconsistency , we are shocked when other people despise and defile the things which are holy to us .
Parsing [sent. 6726 len. 56]: Suppose we should meet with a paragraph like the following , in the newspapers : `` Yesterday a visiting party of the British nobility had a picnic at Mount Vernon , and in the tomb of Washington they ate their luncheon , sang popular songs , played games , and danced waltzes and polkas . ''
Parsing [sent. 6727 len. 5]: Should we be shocked ?
Parsing [sent. 6728 len. 5]: Should we feel outraged ?
Parsing [sent. 6729 len. 5]: Should we be amazed ?
Parsing [sent. 6730 len. 8]: Should we call the performance a desecration ?
Parsing [sent. 6731 len. 7]: Yes , that would all happen .
Parsing [sent. 6732 len. 15]: We should denounce those people in round terms , and call them hard names .
Parsing [sent. 6733 len. 49]: And suppose we found this paragraph in the newspapers : `` Yesterday a visiting party of American pork-millionaires had a picnic in Westminster Abbey , and in that sacred place they ate their luncheon , sang popular songs , played games , and danced waltzes and polkas . ''
Parsing [sent. 6734 len. 6]: Would the English be shocked ?
Parsing [sent. 6735 len. 5]: Would they feel outraged ?
Parsing [sent. 6736 len. 5]: Would they be amazed ?
Parsing [sent. 6737 len. 8]: Would they call the performance a desecration ?
Parsing [sent. 6738 len. 5]: That would all happen .
Parsing [sent. 6739 len. 16]: The pork-millionaires would be denounced in round terms ; they would be called hard names .
Parsing [sent. 6740 len. 135]: In the tomb at Mount Vernon lie the ashes of America 's most honored son ; in the Abbey , the ashes of England 's greatest dead ; the tomb of tombs , the costliest in the earth , the wonder of the world , the Taj , was built by a great Emperor to honor the memory of a perfect wife and perfect mother , one in whom there was no spot or blemish , whose love was his stay and support , whose life was the light of the world to him ; in it her ashes lie , and to the Mohammedan millions of India it is a holy place ; to them it is what Mount Vernon is to Americans , it is what the Abbey is to the English .
Parsing [sent. 6741 len. 71]: Major Sleeman wrote forty or fifty years ago -LRB- the italics are mine -RRB- : `` I would here enter my humble protest against the quadrille and lunch parties which are sometimes given to European ladies and gentlemen of the station at this imperial tomb ; drinking and dancing are no doubt very good things in their season , but they are sadly out of place in a sepulchre . ''
Parsing [sent. 6742 len. 9]: Were there any Americans among those lunch parties ?
Parsing [sent. 6743 len. 8]: If they were invited , there were .
Parsing [sent. 6744 len. 55]: If my imagined lunch-parties in Westminster and the tomb of Washington should take place , the incident would cause a vast outbreak of bitter eloquence about Barbarism and Irreverence ; and it would come from two sets of people who would go next day and dance in the Taj if they had a chance .
Parsing [sent. 6745 len. 39]: As we took our leave of the Benares god and started away we noticed a group of natives waiting respectfully just within the gate -- a Rajah from somewhere in India , and some people of lesser consequence .
Parsing [sent. 6746 len. 23]: The god beckoned them to come , and as we passed out the Rajah was kneeling and reverently kissing his sacred feet .
Parsing [sent. 6747 len. 11]: If Barnum -- but Barnum 's ambitions are at rest .
Parsing [sent. 6748 len. 16]: This god will remain in the holy peace and seclusion of his garden , undisturbed .
Parsing [sent. 6749 len. 9]: Barnum could not have gotten him , anyway .
Parsing [sent. 6750 len. 12]: Still , he would have found a substitute that would answer .
Parsing [sent. 6751 len. 3]: CHAPTER LIV .
Parsing [sent. 6752 len. 6]: Do not undervalue the headache .
Parsing [sent. 6753 len. 27]: While it is at its sharpest it seems a bad investment ; but when relief begins , the unexpired remainder is worth $ 4 a minute .
Parsing [sent. 6754 len. 9]: -- Pudd ` nhead Wilson 's New Calendar .
Parsing [sent. 6755 len. 28]: A comfortable railway journey of seventeen and a half hours brought us to the capital of India , which is likewise the capital of Bengal -- Calcutta .
Parsing [sent. 6756 len. 20]: Like Bombay , it has a population of nearly a million natives and a small gathering of white people .
Parsing [sent. 6757 len. 16]: It is a huge city and fine , and is called the City of Palaces .
Parsing [sent. 6758 len. 37]: It is rich in historical memories ; rich in British achievement -- military , political , commercial ; rich in the results of the miracles done by that brace of mighty magicians , Clive and Hastings .
Parsing [sent. 6759 len. 10]: And has a cloud kissing monument to one Ochterlony .
Parsing [sent. 6760 len. 9]: It is a fluted candlestick 250 feet high .
Parsing [sent. 6761 len. 13]: This lingam is the only large monument in Calcutta , I believe .
Parsing [sent. 6762 len. 13]: It is a fine ornament , and will keep Ochterlony in mind .
Parsing [sent. 6763 len. 28]: Wherever you are , in Calcutta , and for miles around , you can see it ; and always when you see it you think of Ochterlony .
Parsing [sent. 6764 len. 23]: And so there is not an hour in the day that you do not think of Ochterlony and wonder who he was .
Parsing [sent. 6765 len. 36]: It is good that Clive can not come back , for he would think it was for Plassey ; and then that great spirit would be wounded when the revelation came that it was not .
Parsing [sent. 6766 len. 19]: Clive would find out that it was for Ochterlony ; and he would think Ochterlony was a battle .
Parsing [sent. 6767 len. 53]: And he would think it was a great one , too , and he would say , `` With three thousand I whipped sixty thousand and founded the Empire -- and there is no monument ; this other soldier must have whipped a billion with a dozen and saved the world . ''
Parsing [sent. 6768 len. 6]: But he would be mistaken .
Parsing [sent. 6769 len. 9]: Ochterlony was a man , not a battle .
Parsing [sent. 6770 len. 37]: And he did good and honorable service , too ; as good and honorable service as has been done in India by seventy-five or a hundred other Englishmen of courage , rectitude , and distinguished capacity .
Parsing [sent. 6771 len. 33]: For India has been a fertile breeding-ground of such men , and remains so ; great men , both in war and in the civil service , and as modest as great .
Parsing [sent. 6772 len. 12]: But they have no monuments , and were not expecting any .
Parsing [sent. 6773 len. 30]: Ochterlony could not have been expecting one , and it is not at all likely that he desired one -- certainly not until Clive and Hastings should be supplied .
Parsing [sent. 6774 len. 50]: Every day Clive and Hastings lean on the battlements of heaven and look down and wonder which of the two the monument is for ; and they fret and worry because they can not find out , and so the peace of heaven is spoiled for them and lost .
Parsing [sent. 6775 len. 5]: But not for Ochterlony .
Parsing [sent. 6776 len. 5]: Ochterlony is not troubled .
Parsing [sent. 6777 len. 10]: He does n't suspect that it is his monument .
Parsing [sent. 6778 len. 8]: Heaven is sweet and peaceful to him .
Parsing [sent. 6779 len. 10]: There is a sort of unfairness about it all .
Parsing [sent. 6780 len. 29]: Indeed , if monuments were always given in India for high achievements , duty straitly performed , and smirchless records , the landscape would be monotonous with them .
Parsing [sent. 6781 len. 49]: The handful of English in India govern the Indian myriads with apparent ease , and without noticeable friction , through tact , training , and distinguished administrative ability , reinforced by just and liberal laws -- and by keeping their word to the native whenever they give it .
Parsing [sent. 6782 len. 62]: England is far from India and knows little about the eminent services performed by her servants there , for it is the newspaper correspondent who makes fame , and he is not sent to India but to the continent , to report the doings of the princelets and the dukelets , and where they are visiting and whom they are marrying .
Parsing [sent. 6783 len. 68]: Often a British official spends thirty or forty years in India , climbing from grade to grade by services which would make him celebrated anywhere else , and finishes as a vice-sovereign , governing a great realm and millions of subjects ; then he goes home to England substantially unknown and unheard of , and settles down in some modest corner , and is as one extinguished .
Parsing [sent. 6784 len. 37]: Ten years later there is a twenty-line obituary in the London papers , and the reader is paralyzed by the splendors of a career which he is not sure that he had ever heard of before .
Parsing [sent. 6785 len. 13]: But meanwhile he has learned all about the continental princelets and dukelets .
Parsing [sent. 6786 len. 15]: The average man is profoundly ignorant of countries that lie remote from his own .
Parsing [sent. 6787 len. 39]: When they are mentioned in his presence one or two facts and maybe a couple of names rise like torches in his mind , lighting up an inch or two of it and leaving the rest all dark .
Parsing [sent. 6788 len. 13]: The mention of Egypt suggests some Biblical facts and the Pyramids-nothing more .
Parsing [sent. 6789 len. 15]: The mention of South Africa suggests Kimberly and the diamonds and there an end .
Parsing [sent. 6790 len. 27]: Formerly the mention , to a Hindoo , of America suggested a name -- George Washington -- with that his familiarity with our country was exhausted .
Parsing [sent. 6791 len. 53]: Latterly his familiarity with it has doubled in bulk ; so that when America is mentioned now , two torches flare up in the dark caverns of his mind and he says , `` Ah , the country of the great man Washington ; and of the Holy City -- Chicago . ''
Parsing [sent. 6792 len. 22]: For he knows about the Congress of Religion , and this has enabled him to get an erroneous impression of Chicago .
Parsing [sent. 6793 len. 42]: When India is mentioned to the citizen of a far country it suggests Clive , Hastings , the Mutiny , Kipling , and a number of other great events ; and the mention of Calcutta infallibly brings up the Black Hole .
Parsing [sent. 6794 len. 30]: And so , when that citizen finds himself in the capital of India he goes first of all to see the Black Hole of Calcutta -- and is disappointed .
Parsing [sent. 6795 len. 16]: The Black Hole was not preserved ; it is gone , long , long ago .
Parsing [sent. 6796 len. 4]: It is strange .
Parsing [sent. 6797 len. 15]: Just as it stood , it was itself a monument ; a ready-made one .
Parsing [sent. 6798 len. 32]: It was finished , it was complete , its materials were strong and lasting , it needed no furbishing up , no repairs ; it merely needed to be let alone .
Parsing [sent. 6799 len. 25]: It was the first brick , the Foundation Stone , upon which was reared a mighty Empire -- the Indian Empire of Great Britain .
Parsing [sent. 6800 len. 69]: It was the ghastly episode of the Black Hole that maddened the British and brought Clive , that young military marvel , raging up from Madras ; it was the seed from which sprung Plassey ; and it was that extraordinary battle , whose like had not been seen in the earth since Agincourt , that laid deep and strong the foundations of England 's colossal Indian sovereignty .
Parsing [sent. 6801 len. 36]: And yet within the time of men who still live , the Black Hole was torn down and thrown away as carelessly as if its bricks were common clay , not ingots of historic gold .
Parsing [sent. 6802 len. 8]: There is no accounting for human beings .
Parsing [sent. 6803 len. 14]: The supposed site of the Black Hole is marked by an engraved plate .
Parsing [sent. 6804 len. 10]: I saw that ; and better that than nothing .
Parsing [sent. 6805 len. 42]: The Black Hole was a prison -- a cell is nearer the right word -- eighteen feet square , the dimensions of an ordinary bedchamber ; and into this place the victorious Nabob of Bengal packed 146 of his English prisoners .
Parsing [sent. 6806 len. 28]: There was hardly standing room for them ; scarcely a breath of air was to be got ; the time was night , the weather sweltering hot .
Parsing [sent. 6807 len. 13]: Before the dawn came , the captives were all dead but twenty-three .
Parsing [sent. 6808 len. 34]: Mr. Holwell 's long account of the awful episode was familiar to the world a hundred years ago , but one seldom sees in print even an extract from it in our day .
Parsing [sent. 6809 len. 9]: Among the striking things in it is this .
Parsing [sent. 6810 len. 18]: Mr. Holwell , perishing with thirst , kept himself alive by sucking the perspiration from his sleeves .
Parsing [sent. 6811 len. 10]: It gives one a vivid idea of the situation .
Parsing [sent. 6812 len. 27]: He presently found that while he was busy drawing life from one of his sleeves a young English gentleman was stealing supplies from the other one .
Parsing [sent. 6813 len. 50]: Holwell was an unselfish man , a man of the most generous impulses ; he lived and died famous for these fine and rare qualities ; yet when he found out what was happening to that unwatched sleeve , he took the precaution to suck that one dry first .
Parsing [sent. 6814 len. 16]: The miseries of the Black Hole were able to change even a nature like his .
Parsing [sent. 6815 len. 24]: But that young gentleman was one of the twenty-three survivors , and he said it was the stolen perspiration that saved his life .
Parsing [sent. 6816 len. 46]: From the middle of Mr. Holwell 's narrative I will make a brief excerpt : `` Then a general prayer to Heaven , to hasten the approach of the flames to the right and left of us , and put a period to our misery .
Parsing [sent. 6817 len. 73]: But these failing , they whose strength and spirits were quite exhausted laid themselves down and expired quietly upon their fellows : others who had yet some strength and vigor left made a last effort at the windows , and several succeeded by leaping and scrambling over the backs and heads of those in the first rank , and got hold of the bars , from which there was no removing them .
Parsing [sent. 6818 len. 114]: Many to the right and left sunk with the violent pressure , and were soon suffocated ; for now a steam arose from the living and the dead , which affected us in all its circumstances as if we were forcibly held with our heads over a bowl full of strong volatile spirit of hartshorn , until suffocated ; nor could the effluvia of the one be distinguished from the other , and frequently , when I was forced by the load upon my head and shoulders to hold my face down , I was obliged , near as I was to the window , instantly to raise it again to avoid suffocation .
Parsing [sent. 6819 len. 62]: I need not , my dear friend , ask your commiseration , when I tell you , that in this plight , from half an hour past eleven till near two in the morning , I sustained the weight of a heavy man , with his knees in my back , and the pressure of his whole body on my head .
Parsing [sent. 6820 len. 47]: A Dutch surgeon who had taken his seat upon my left shoulder , and a Topaz -LRB- a black Christian soldier -RRB- bearing on my right ; all which nothing could have enabled me to support but the props and pressure equally sustaining me all around .
Parsing [sent. 6821 len. 34]: The two latter I frequently dislodged by shifting my hold on the bars and driving my knuckles into their ribs ; but my friend above stuck fast , held immovable by two bars .
Parsing [sent. 6822 len. 75]: `` I exerted anew my strength and fortitude ; but the repeated trials and efforts I made to dislodge the insufferable incumbrances upon me at last quite exhausted me ; and towards two o'clock , finding I must quit the window or sink where I was , I resolved on the former , having bore , truly for the sake of others , infinitely more for life than the best of it is worth .
Parsing [sent. 6823 len. 61]: In the rank close behind me was an officer of one of the ships , whose name was Cary , and who had behaved with much bravery during the siege -LRB- his wife , a fine woman , though country born , would not quit him , but accompanied him into the prison , and was one who survived -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 6824 len. 30]: This poor wretch had been long raving for water and air ; I told him I was determined to give up life , and recommended his gaining my station .
Parsing [sent. 6825 len. 28]: On my quitting it he made a fruitless attempt to get my place ; but the Dutch surgeon , who sat on my shoulder , supplanted him .
Parsing [sent. 6826 len. 53]: Poor Cary expressed his thankfulness , and said he would give up life too ; but it was with the utmost labor we forced our way from the window -LRB- several in the inner ranks appearing to me dead standing , unable to fall by the throng and equal pressure around -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 6827 len. 29]: He laid himself down to die ; and his death , I believe , was very sudden ; for he was a short , full , sanguine man .
Parsing [sent. 6828 len. 28]: His strength was great ; and , I imagine , had he not retired with me , I should never have been able to force my way .
Parsing [sent. 6829 len. 37]: I was at this time sensible of no pain , and little uneasiness ; I can give you no better idea of my situation than by repeating my simile of the bowl of spirit of hartshorn .
Parsing [sent. 6830 len. 46]: I found a stupor coming on apace , and laid myself down by that gallant old man , the Rev. Mr. Jervas Bellamy , who laid dead with his son , the lieutenant , hand in hand , near the southernmost wall of the prison .
Parsing [sent. 6831 len. 39]: When I had lain there some little time , I still had reflection enough to suffer some uneasiness in the thought that I should be trampled upon , when dead , as I myself had done to others .
Parsing [sent. 6832 len. 57]: With some difficulty I raised myself , and gained the platform a second time , where I presently lost all sensation ; the last trace of sensibility that I have been able to recollect after my laying down , was my sash being uneasy about my waist , which I untied , and threw from me .
Parsing [sent. 6833 len. 27]: Of what passed in this interval , to the time of my resurrection from this hole of horrors , I can give you no account . ''
Parsing [sent. 6834 len. 18]: There was plenty to see in Calcutta , but there was not plenty of time for it .
Parsing [sent. 6835 len. 146]: I saw the fort that Clive built ; and the place where Warren Hastings and the author of the Junius Letters fought their duel ; and the great botanical gardens ; and the fashionable afternoon turnout in the Maidan ; and a grand review of the garrison in a great plain at sunrise ; and a military tournament in which great bodies of native soldiery exhibited the perfection of their drill at all arms , a spectacular and beautiful show occupying several nights and closing with the mimic storming of a native fort which was as good as the reality for thrilling and accurate detail , and better than the reality for security and comfort ; we had a pleasure excursion on the ` Hoogly ' by courtesy of friends , and devoted the rest of the time to social life and the Indian museum .
Parsing [sent. 6836 len. 16]: One should spend a month in the museum , an enchanted palace of Indian antiquities .
Parsing [sent. 6837 len. 20]: Indeed , a person might spend half a year among the beautiful and wonderful things without exhausting their interest .
Parsing [sent. 6838 len. 4]: It was winter .
Parsing [sent. 6839 len. 28]: We were of Kipling 's `` hosts of tourists who travel up and down India in the cold weather showing how things ought to be managed . ''
Parsing [sent. 6840 len. 23]: It is a common expression there , `` the cold weather , '' and the people think there is such a thing .
Parsing [sent. 6841 len. 18]: It is because they have lived there half a lifetime , and their perceptions have become blunted .
Parsing [sent. 6842 len. 20]: When a person is accustomed to 138 in the shade , his ideas about cold weather are not valuable .
Parsing [sent. 6843 len. 48]: I had read , in the histories , that the June marches made between Lucknow and Cawnpore by the British forces in the time of the Mutiny were made in that kind of weather -- 138 in the shade -- and had taken it for historical embroidery .
Parsing [sent. 6844 len. 42]: I had read it again in Serjeant-Major Forbes-Mitchell 's account of his military experiences in the Mutiny -- at least I thought I had -- and in Calcutta I asked him if it was true , and he said it was .
Parsing [sent. 6845 len. 18]: An officer of high rank who had been in the thick of the Mutiny said the same .
Parsing [sent. 6846 len. 49]: As long as those men were talking about what they knew , they were trustworthy , and I believed them ; but when they said it was now `` cold weather , '' I saw that they had traveled outside of their sphere of knowledge and were floundering .
Parsing [sent. 6847 len. 45]: I believe that in India `` cold weather '' is merely a conventional phrase and has come into use through the necessity of having some way to distinguish between weather which will melt a brass door-knob and weather which will only make it mushy .
Parsing [sent. 6848 len. 41]: It was observable that brass ones were in use while I was in Calcutta , showing that it was not yet time to change to porcelain ; I was told the change to porcelain was not usually made until May .
Parsing [sent. 6849 len. 25]: But this cold weather was too warm for us ; so we started to Darjeeling , in the Himalayas -- a twenty-four hour journey .
Parsing [sent. 6850 len. 3]: CHAPTER LV .
Parsing [sent. 6851 len. 18]: There are 869 different forms of lying , but only one of them has been squarely forbidden .
Parsing [sent. 6852 len. 10]: Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor .
Parsing [sent. 6853 len. 9]: -- Pudd ` nhead Wilson 's New Calendar .
Parsing [sent. 6854 len. 6]: FROM DIARY : February 14 .
Parsing [sent. 6855 len. 23]: We left at 4:30 P.M. Until dark we moved through rich vegetation , then changed to a boat and crossed the Ganges .
Parsing [sent. 6856 len. 3]: February 15 .
Parsing [sent. 6857 len. 5]: Up with the sun .
Parsing [sent. 6858 len. 7]: A brilliant morning , and frosty .
Parsing [sent. 6859 len. 9]: A double suit of flannels is found necessary .
Parsing [sent. 6860 len. 27]: The plain is perfectly level , and seems to stretch away and away and away , dimming and softening , to the uttermost bounds of nowhere .
Parsing [sent. 6861 len. 18]: What a soaring , strenuous , gushing fountain spray of delicate greenery a bunch of bamboo is !
Parsing [sent. 6862 len. 24]: As far as the eye can reach , these grand vegetable geysers grace the view , their spoutings refined to steam by distance .
Parsing [sent. 6863 len. 21]: And there are fields of bananas , with the sunshine glancing from the varnished surface of their drooping vast leaves .
Parsing [sent. 6864 len. 61]: And there are frequent groves of palm ; and an effective accent is given to the landscape by isolated individuals of this picturesque family , towering , clean-stemmed , their plumes broken and hanging ragged , Nature 's imitation of an umbrella that has been out to see what a cyclone is like and is trying not to look disappointed .
Parsing [sent. 6865 len. 98]: And everywhere through the soft morning vistas we glimpse the villages , the countless villages , the myriad villages , thatched , built of clean new matting , snuggling among grouped palms and sheaves of bamboo ; villages , villages , no end of villages , not three hundred yards apart , and dozens and dozens of them in sight all the time ; a mighty City , hundreds of miles long , hundreds of miles broad , made all of villages , the biggest city in the earth , and as populous as a European kingdom .
Parsing [sent. 6866 len. 10]: I have seen no such city as this before .
Parsing [sent. 6867 len. 20]: And there is a continuously repeated and replenished multitude of naked men in view on both sides and ahead .
Parsing [sent. 6868 len. 33]: We fly through it mile after mile , but still it is always there , on both sides and ahead -- brown-bodied , naked men and boys , plowing in the fields .
Parsing [sent. 6869 len. 5]: But not a woman .
Parsing [sent. 6870 len. 18]: In these two hours I have not seen a woman or a girl working in the fields .
Parsing [sent. 6871 len. 24]: `` From Greenland 's icy mountains , From India 's coral strand , Where Afric 's sunny fountains Roll down their golden sand .
Parsing [sent. 6872 len. 25]: From many an ancient river , From many a palmy plain , They call us to deliver Their land from error 's chain . ''
Parsing [sent. 6873 len. 16]: Those are beautiful verses , and they have remained in my memory all my life .
Parsing [sent. 6874 len. 56]: But if the closing lines are true , let us hope that when we come to answer the call and deliver the land from its errors , we shall secrete from it some of our high-civilization ways , and at the same time borrow some of its pagan ways to enrich our high system with .
Parsing [sent. 6875 len. 8]: We have a right to do this .
Parsing [sent. 6876 len. 26]: If we lift those people up , we have a right to lift ourselves up nine or ten grades or so , at their expense .
Parsing [sent. 6877 len. 14]: A few years ago I spent several weeks at Tolz , in Bavaria .
Parsing [sent. 6878 len. 20]: It is a Roman Catholic region , and not even Benares is more deeply or pervasively or intelligently devout .
Parsing [sent. 6879 len. 24]: In my diary of those days I find this : `` We took a long drive yesterday around about the lovely country roads .
Parsing [sent. 6880 len. 35]: But it was a drive whose pleasure was damaged in a couple of ways : by the dreadful shrines and by the shameful spectacle of gray and venerable old grandmothers toiling in the fields .
Parsing [sent. 6881 len. 30]: The shrines were frequent along the roads -- figures of the Saviour nailed to the cross and streaming with blood from the wounds of the nails and the thorns .
Parsing [sent. 6882 len. 15]: `` When missionaries go from here do they find fault with the pagan idols ?
Parsing [sent. 6883 len. 26]: I saw many women seventy and even eighty years old mowing and binding in the fields , and pitchforking the loads into the wagons . ''
Parsing [sent. 6884 len. 10]: I was in Austria later , and in Munich .
Parsing [sent. 6885 len. 27]: In Munich I saw gray old women pushing trucks up hill and down , long distances , trucks laden with barrels of beer , incredible loads .
Parsing [sent. 6886 len. 30]: In my Austrian diary I find this : `` In the fields I often see a woman and a cow harnessed to the plow , and a man driving .
Parsing [sent. 6887 len. 58]: `` In the public street of Marienbad to-day , I saw an old , bent , gray-headed woman , in harness with a dog , drawing a laden sled over bare dirt roads and bare pavements ; and at his ease walked the driver , smoking his pipe , a hale fellow not thirty years old . ''
Parsing [sent. 6888 len. 53]: Five or six years ago I bought an open boat , made a kind of a canvas wagon-roof over the stern of it to shelter me from sun and rain ; hired a courier and a boatman , and made a twelve-day floating voyage down the Rhone from Lake Bourget to Marseilles .
Parsing [sent. 6889 len. 11]: In my diary of that trip I find this entry .
Parsing [sent. 6890 len. 38]: I was far down the Rhone then : `` Passing St. Etienne , 2:15 P.M. On a distant ridge inland , a tall openwork structure commandingly situated , with a statue of the Virgin standing on it .
Parsing [sent. 6891 len. 4]: A devout country .
Parsing [sent. 6892 len. 20]: All down this river , wherever there is a crag there is a statue of the Virgin on it .
Parsing [sent. 6893 len. 10]: I believe I have seen a hundred of them .
Parsing [sent. 6894 len. 29]: And yet , in many respects , the peasantry seem to be mere pagans , and destitute of any considerable degree of civilization . '' . . . .
Parsing [sent. 6895 len. 50]: We reached a not very promising looking village about 4 o'clock , and I concluded to tie up for the day ; munching fruit and fogging the hood with pipe-smoke had grown monotonous ; I could not have the hood furled , because the floods of rain fell unceasingly .
Parsing [sent. 6896 len. 13]: The tavern was on the river bank , as is the custom .
Parsing [sent. 6897 len. 46]: It was dull there , and melancholy -- nothing to do but look out of the window into the drenching rain , and shiver ; one could do that , for it was bleak and cold and windy , and country France furnishes no fire .
Parsing [sent. 6898 len. 16]: Winter overcoats did not help me much ; they had to be supplemented with rugs .
Parsing [sent. 6899 len. 21]: The raindrops were so large and struck the river with such force that they knocked up the water like pebble-splashes .
Parsing [sent. 6900 len. 26]: `` With the exception of a very occasional woodenshod peasant , nobody was abroad in this bitter weather -- I mean nobody of our sex .
Parsing [sent. 6901 len. 13]: But all weathers are alike to the women in these continental countries .
Parsing [sent. 6902 len. 16]: To them and the other animals , life is serious ; nothing interrupts their slavery .
Parsing [sent. 6903 len. 31]: Three of them were washing clothes in the river under the window when I arrived , and they continued at it as long as there was light to work by .
Parsing [sent. 6904 len. 10]: One was apparently thirty ; another -- the mother !
Parsing [sent. 6905 len. 9]: -- above fifty ; the third -- grandmother !
Parsing [sent. 6906 len. 22]: -- so old and worn and gray she could have passed for eighty ; I took her to be that old .
Parsing [sent. 6907 len. 40]: They had no waterproofs nor rubbers , of course ; over their shoulders they wore gunnysacks -- simply conductors for rivers of water ; some of the volume reached the ground ; the rest soaked in on the way .
Parsing [sent. 6908 len. 34]: `` At last a vigorous fellow of thirty-five arrived , dry and comfortable , smoking his pipe under his big umbrella in an open donkey-cart-husband , son , and grandson of those women !
Parsing [sent. 6909 len. 36]: He stood up in the cart , sheltering himself , and began to superintend , issuing his orders in a masterly tone of command , and showing temper when they were not obeyed swiftly enough .
Parsing [sent. 6910 len. 35]: `` Without complaint or murmur the drowned women patiently carried out the orders , lifting the immense baskets of soggy , wrung-out clothing into the cart and stowing them to the man 's satisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 6911 len. 24]: There were six of the great baskets , and a man of mere ordinary strength could not have lifted any one of them .
Parsing [sent. 6912 len. 47]: The cart being full now , the Frenchman descended , still sheltered by his umbrella , entered the tavern , and the women went drooping homeward , trudging in the wake of the cart , and soon were blended with the deluge and lost to sight .
Parsing [sent. 6913 len. 38]: `` When I went down into the public room , the Frenchman had his bottle of wine and plate of food on a bare table black with grease , and was ` chomping ' like a horse .
Parsing [sent. 6914 len. 45]: He had the little religious paper which is in everybody 's hands on the Rhone borders , and was enlightening himself with the histories of French saints who used to flee to the desert in the Middle Ages to escape the contamination of woman .
Parsing [sent. 6915 len. 14]: For two hundred years France has been sending missionaries to other savage lands .
Parsing [sent. 6916 len. 16]: To spare to the needy from poverty like hers is fine and true generosity . ''
Parsing [sent. 6917 len. 27]: But to get back to India -- where , as my favorite poem says -- `` Every prospect pleases , And only man is vile . ''
Parsing [sent. 6918 len. 17]: It is because Bavaria and Austria and France have not introduced their civilization to him yet .
Parsing [sent. 6919 len. 11]: But Bavaria and Austria and France are on their way .
Parsing [sent. 6920 len. 4]: They are coming .
Parsing [sent. 6921 len. 14]: They will rescue him ; they will refine the vileness out of him .
Parsing [sent. 6922 len. 49]: Some time during the forenoon , approaching the mountains , we changed from the regular train to one composed of little canvas-sheltered cars that skimmed along within a foot of the ground and seemed to be going fifty miles an hour when they were really making about twenty .
Parsing [sent. 6923 len. 38]: Each car had seating capacity for half-a-dozen persons ; and when the curtains were up one was substantially out of doors , and could see everywhere , and get all the breeze , and be luxuriously comfortable .
Parsing [sent. 6924 len. 14]: It was not a pleasure excursion in name only , but in fact .
Parsing [sent. 6925 len. 41]: After a while we stopped at a little wooden coop of a station just within the curtain of the sombre jungle , a place with a deep and dense forest of great trees and scrub and vines all about it .
Parsing [sent. 6926 len. 17]: The royal Bengal tiger is in great force there , and is very bold and unconventional .
Parsing [sent. 6927 len. 28]: From this lonely little station a message once went to the railway manager in Calcutta : `` Tiger eating station-master on front porch ; telegraph instructions . ''
Parsing [sent. 6928 len. 11]: It was there that I had my first tiger hunt .
Parsing [sent. 6929 len. 4]: I killed thirteen .
Parsing [sent. 6930 len. 15]: We were presently away again , and the train began to climb the mountains .
Parsing [sent. 6931 len. 22]: In one place seven wild elephants crossed the track , but two of them got away before I could overtake them .
Parsing [sent. 6932 len. 19]: The railway journey up the mountain is forty miles , and it takes eight hours to make it .
Parsing [sent. 6933 len. 18]: It is so wild and interesting and exciting and enchanting that it ought to take a week .
Parsing [sent. 6934 len. 10]: As for the vegetation , it is a museum .
Parsing [sent. 6935 len. 23]: The jungle seemed to contain samples of every rare and curious tree and bush that we had ever seen or heard of .
Parsing [sent. 6936 len. 28]: It is from that museum , I think , that the globe must have been supplied with the trees and vines and shrubs that it holds precious .
Parsing [sent. 6937 len. 8]: The road is infinitely and charmingly crooked .
Parsing [sent. 6938 len. 106]: It goes winding in and out under lofty cliffs that are smothered in vines and foliage , and around the edges of bottomless chasms ; and all the way one glides by files of picturesque natives , some carrying burdens up , others going down from their work in the tea-gardens ; and once there was a gaudy wedding procession , all bright tinsel and color , and a bride , comely and girlish , who peeped out from the curtains of her palanquin , exposing her face with that pure delight which the young and happy take in sin for sin 's own sake .
Parsing [sent. 6939 len. 62]: By and by we were well up in the region of the clouds , and from that breezy height we looked down and afar over a wonderful picture -- the Plains of India , stretching to the horizon , soft and fair , level as a floor , shimmering with heat , mottled with cloud-shadows , and cloven with shining rivers .
Parsing [sent. 6940 len. 46]: Immediately below us , and receding down , down , down , toward the valley , was a shaven confusion of hilltops , with ribbony roads and paths squirming and snaking cream-yellow all over them and about them , every curve and twist sharply distinct .
Parsing [sent. 6941 len. 24]: At an elevation of 6,000 feet we entered a thick cloud , and it shut out the world and kept it shut out .
Parsing [sent. 6942 len. 29]: We climbed 1,000 feet higher , then began to descend , and presently got down to Darjeeling , which is 6,000 feet above the level of the Plains .
Parsing [sent. 6943 len. 29]: We had passed many a mountain village on the way up , and seen some new kinds of natives , among them many samples of the fighting Ghurkas .
Parsing [sent. 6944 len. 13]: They are not large men , but they are strong and resolute .
Parsing [sent. 6945 len. 11]: There are no better soldiers among Britain 's native troops .
Parsing [sent. 6946 len. 59]: And we had passed shoals of their women climbing the forty miles of steep road from the valley to their mountain homes , with tall baskets on their backs hitched to their foreheads by a band , and containing a freightage weighing -- I will not say how many hundreds of pounds , for the sum is unbelievable .
Parsing [sent. 6947 len. 24]: These were young women , and they strode smartly along under these astonishing burdens with the air of people out for a holiday .
Parsing [sent. 6948 len. 31]: I was told that a woman will carry a piano on her back all the way up the mountain ; and that more than once a woman had done it .
Parsing [sent. 6949 len. 18]: If these were old women I should regard the Ghurkas as no more civilized than the Europeans .
Parsing [sent. 6950 len. 36]: At the railway station at Darjeeling you find plenty of cab-substitutes -- open coffins , in which you sit , and are then borne on men 's shoulders up the steep roads into the town .
Parsing [sent. 6951 len. 33]: Up there we found a fairly comfortable hotel , the property of an indiscriminate and incoherent landlord , who looks after nothing , but leaves everything to his army of Indian servants .
Parsing [sent. 6952 len. 27]: No , he does look after the bill -- to be just to him -- and the tourist can not do better than follow his example .
Parsing [sent. 6953 len. 40]: I was told by a resident that the summit of Kinchinjunga is often hidden in the clouds , and that sometimes a tourist has waited twenty-two days and then been obliged to go away without a sight of it .
Parsing [sent. 6954 len. 27]: And yet went not disappointed ; for when he got his hotel bill he recognized that he was now seeing the highest thing in the Himalayas .
Parsing [sent. 6955 len. 7]: But this is probably a lie .
Parsing [sent. 6956 len. 17]: After lecturing I went to the Club that night , and that was a comfortable place .
Parsing [sent. 6957 len. 51]: It is loftily situated , and looks out over a vast spread of scenery ; from it you can see where the boundaries of three countries come together , some thirty miles away ; Thibet is one of them , Nepaul another , and I think Herzegovina was the other .
Parsing [sent. 6958 len. 36]: Apparently , in every town and city in India the gentlemen of the British civil and military service have a club ; sometimes it is a palatial one , always it is pleasant and homelike .
Parsing [sent. 6959 len. 33]: The hotels are not always as good as they might be , and the stranger who has access to the Club is grateful for his privilege and knows how to value it .
Parsing [sent. 6960 len. 5]: Next day was Sunday .
Parsing [sent. 6961 len. 55]: Friends came in the gray dawn with horses , and my party rode away to a distant point where Kinchinjunga and Mount Everest show up best , but I stayed at home for a private view ; for it was very cold , and I was not acquainted with the horses , any way .
Parsing [sent. 6962 len. 60]: I got a pipe and a few blankets and sat for two hours at the window , and saw the sun drive away the veiling gray and touch up the snow-peaks one after another with pale pink splashes and delicate washes of gold , and finally flood the whole mighty convulsion of snow-mountains with a deluge of rich splendors .
Parsing [sent. 6963 len. 50]: Kinchinjunga 's peak was but fitfully visible , but in the between times it was vividly clear against the sky -- away up there in the blue dome more than 28,000 feet above sea level -- the loftiest land I had ever seen , by 12,000 feet or more .
Parsing [sent. 6964 len. 6]: It was 45 miles away .
Parsing [sent. 6965 len. 52]: Mount Everest is a thousand feet higher , but it was not a part of that sea of mountains piled up there before me , so I did not see it ; but I did not care , because I think that mountains that are as high as that are disagreeable .
Parsing [sent. 6966 len. 35]: I changed from the back to the front of the house and spent the rest of the morning there , watching the swarthy strange tribes flock by from their far homes in the Himalayas .
Parsing [sent. 6967 len. 32]: All ages and both sexes were represented , and the breeds were quite new to me , though the costumes of the Thibetans made them look a good deal like Chinamen .
Parsing [sent. 6968 len. 7]: The prayer-wheel was a frequent feature .
Parsing [sent. 6969 len. 16]: It brought me near to these people , and made them seem kinfolk of mine .
Parsing [sent. 6970 len. 12]: Through our preacher we do much of our praying by proxy .
Parsing [sent. 6971 len. 20]: We do not whirl him around a stick , as they do , but that is merely a detail .
Parsing [sent. 6972 len. 16]: The swarm swung briskly by , hour after hour , a strange and striking pageant .
Parsing [sent. 6973 len. 11]: It was wasted there , and it seemed a pity .
Parsing [sent. 6974 len. 26]: It should have been sent streaming through the cities of Europe or America , to refresh eyes weary of the pale monotonies of the circus-pageant .
Parsing [sent. 6975 len. 13]: These people were bound for the bazar , with things to sell .
Parsing [sent. 6976 len. 47]: We went down there , later , and saw that novel congress of the wild peoples , and plowed here and there through it , and concluded that it would be worth coming from Calcutta to see , even if there were no Kinchinjunga and Everest .
Parsing [sent. 6977 len. 3]: CHAPTER LVI .
Parsing [sent. 6978 len. 27]: There are two times in a man 's life when he should not speculate : when he ca n't afford it , and when he can .
Parsing [sent. 6979 len. 9]: -- Pudd ` nhead Wilson 's New Calendar .
Parsing [sent. 6980 len. 39]: On Monday and Tuesday at sunrise we again had fair-to-middling views of the stupendous mountains ; then , being well cooled off and refreshed , we were ready to chance the weather of the lower world once more .
Parsing [sent. 6981 len. 26]: We traveled up hill by the regular train five miles to the summit , then changed to a little canvas-canopied hand-car for the 35-mile descent .
Parsing [sent. 6982 len. 25]: It was the size of a sleigh , it had six seats and was so low that it seemed to rest on the ground .
Parsing [sent. 6983 len. 21]: It had no engine or other propelling power , and needed none to help it fly down those steep inclines .
Parsing [sent. 6984 len. 17]: It only needed a strong brake , to modify its flight , and it had that .
Parsing [sent. 6985 len. 37]: There was a story of a disastrous trip made down the mountain once in this little car by the Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal , when the car jumped the track and threw its passengers over a precipice .
Parsing [sent. 6986 len. 43]: It was not true , but the story had value for me , for it made me nervous , and nervousness wakes a person up and makes him alive and alert , and heightens the thrill of a new and doubtful experience .
Parsing [sent. 6987 len. 71]: The car could really jump the track , of course ; a pebble on the track , placed there by either accident or malice , at a sharp curve where one might strike it before the eye could discover it , could derail the car and fling it down into India ; and the fact that the lieutenant-governor had escaped was no proof that I would have the same luck .
Parsing [sent. 6988 len. 33]: And standing there , looking down upon the Indian Empire from the airy altitude of 7,000 feet , it seemed unpleasantly far , dangerously far , to be flung from a handcar .
Parsing [sent. 6989 len. 13]: But after all , there was but small danger -- for me .
Parsing [sent. 6990 len. 29]: What there was , was for Mr. Pugh , inspector of a division of the Indian police , in whose company and protection we had come from Calcutta .
Parsing [sent. 6991 len. 63]: He had seen long service as an artillery officer , was less nervous than I was , and so he was to go ahead of us in a pilot hand-car , with a Ghurka and another native ; and the plan was that when we should see his car jump over a precipice we must put on our break -LSB- sp . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 6992 len. 6]: and send for another pilot .
Parsing [sent. 6993 len. 6]: It was a good arrangement .
Parsing [sent. 6994 len. 35]: Also Mr. Barnard , chief engineer of the mountain-division of the road , was to take personal charge of our car , and he had been down the mountain in it many a time .
Parsing [sent. 6995 len. 4]: Everything looked safe .
Parsing [sent. 6996 len. 31]: Indeed , there was but one questionable detail left : the regular train was to follow us as soon as we should start , and it might run over us .
Parsing [sent. 6997 len. 7]: Privately , I thought it would .
Parsing [sent. 6998 len. 46]: The road fell sharply down in front of us and went corkscrewing in and out around the crags and precipices , down , down , forever down , suggesting nothing so exactly or so uncomfortably as a crooked toboggan slide with no end to it .
Parsing [sent. 6999 len. 29]: Mr. Pugh waved his flag and started , like an arrow from a bow , and before I could get out of the car we were gone too .
Parsing [sent. 7000 len. 40]: I had previously had but one sensation like the shock of that departure , and that was the gaspy shock that took my breath away the first time that I was discharged from the summit of a toboggan slide .
Parsing [sent. 7001 len. 30]: But in both instances the sensation was pleasurable -- intensely so ; it was a sudden and immense exaltation , a mixed ecstasy of deadly fright and unimaginable joy .
Parsing [sent. 7002 len. 12]: I believe that this combination makes the perfection of human delight .
Parsing [sent. 7003 len. 46]: The pilot car 's flight down the mountain suggested the swoop of a swallow that is skimming the ground , so swiftly and smoothly and gracefully it swept down the long straight reaches and soared in and out of the bends and around the corners .
Parsing [sent. 7004 len. 86]: We raced after it , and seemed to flash by the capes and crags with the speed of light ; and now and then we almost overtook it -- and had hopes ; but it was only playing with us ; when we got near , it released its brake , made a spring around a corner , and the next time it spun into view , a few seconds later , it looked as small as a wheelbarrow , it was so far away .
Parsing [sent. 7005 len. 10]: We played with the train in the same way .
Parsing [sent. 7006 len. 69]: We often got out to gather flowers or sit on a precipice and look at the scenery , then presently we would hear a dull and growing roar , and the long coils of the train would come into sight behind and above us ; but we did not need to start till the locomotive was close down upon us -- then we soon left it far behind .
Parsing [sent. 7007 len. 17]: It had to stop at every station , therefore it was not an embarrassment to us .
Parsing [sent. 7008 len. 26]: Our brake was a good piece of machinery ; it could bring the car to a standstill on a slope as steep as a house-roof .
Parsing [sent. 7009 len. 23]: The scenery was grand and varied and beautiful , and there was no hurry ; we could always stop and examine it .
Parsing [sent. 7010 len. 6]: There was abundance of time .
Parsing [sent. 7011 len. 33]: We did not need to hamper the train ; if it wanted the road , we could switch off and let it go by , then overtake it and pass it later .
Parsing [sent. 7012 len. 31]: We stopped at one place to see the Gladstone Cliff , a great crag which the ages and the weather have sculptured into a recognizable portrait of the venerable statesman .
Parsing [sent. 7013 len. 33]: Mr. Gladstone is a stockholder in the road , and Nature began this portrait ten thousand years ago , with the idea of having the compliment ready in time for the event .
Parsing [sent. 7014 len. 20]: We saw a banyan tree which sent down supporting stems from branches which were sixty feet above the ground .
Parsing [sent. 7015 len. 35]: That is , I suppose it was a banyan ; its bark resembled that of the great banyan in the botanical gardens at Calcutta , that spider-legged thing with its wilderness of vegetable columns .
Parsing [sent. 7016 len. 26]: And there were frequent glimpses of a totally leafless tree upon whose innumerable twigs and branches a cloud of crimson butterflies had lighted -- apparently .
Parsing [sent. 7017 len. 15]: In fact these brilliant red butterflies were flowers , but the illusion was good .
Parsing [sent. 7018 len. 15]: Afterward in South Africa , I saw another splendid effect made by red flowers .
Parsing [sent. 7019 len. 16]: This flower was probably called the torch-plant -- should have been so named , anyway .
Parsing [sent. 7020 len. 35]: It had a slender stem several feet high , and from its top stood up a single tongue of flame , an intensely red flower of the size and shape of a small corn-cob .
Parsing [sent. 7021 len. 44]: The stems stood three or four feet apart all over a great hill-slope that was a mile long , and make one think of what the Place de la Concorde would be if its myriad lights were red instead of white and yellow .
Parsing [sent. 7022 len. 18]: A few miles down the mountain we stopped half an hour to see a Thibetan dramatic performance .
Parsing [sent. 7023 len. 10]: It was in the open air on the hillside .
Parsing [sent. 7024 len. 14]: The audience was composed of Thibetans , Ghurkas , and other unusual people .
Parsing [sent. 7025 len. 22]: The costumes of the actors were in the last degree outlandish , and the performance was in keeping with the clothes .
Parsing [sent. 7026 len. 45]: To an accompaniment of barbarous noises the actors stepped out one after another and began to spin around with immense swiftness and vigor and violence , chanting the while , and soon the whole troupe would be spinning and chanting and raising the dust .
Parsing [sent. 7027 len. 25]: They were performing an ancient and celebrated historical play , and a Chinaman explained it to me in pidjin English as it went along .
Parsing [sent. 7028 len. 20]: The play was obscure enough without the explanation ; with the explanation added , it was -LRB- opake -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 7029 len. 28]: As a drama this ancient historical work of art was defective , I thought , but as a wild and barbarous spectacle the representation was beyond criticism .
Parsing [sent. 7030 len. 94]: Far down the mountain we got out to look at a piece of remarkable loop-engineering -- a spiral where the road curves upon itself with such abruptness that when the regular train came down and entered the loop , we stood over it and saw the locomotive disappear under our bridge , then in a few moments appear again , chasing its own tail ; and we saw it gain on it , overtake it , draw ahead past the rear cars , and run a race with that end of the train .
Parsing [sent. 7031 len. 8]: It was like a snake swallowing itself .
Parsing [sent. 7032 len. 50]: Half-way down the mountain we stopped about an hour at Mr. Barnard 's house for refreshments , and while we were sitting on the veranda looking at the distant panorama of hills through a gap in the forest , we came very near seeing a leopard kill a calf .
Parsing [sent. 7033 len. 10]: -- -LSB- It killed it the day before . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 7034 len. 9]: -- It is a wild place and lovely .
Parsing [sent. 7035 len. 36]: From the woods all about came the songs of birds , -- among them the contributions of a couple of birds which I was not then acquainted with : the brain-fever bird and the coppersmith .
Parsing [sent. 7036 len. 85]: The song of the brain-fever demon starts on a low but steadily rising key , and is a spiral twist which augments in intensity and severity with each added spiral , growing sharper and sharper , and more and more painful , more and more agonizing , more and more maddening , intolerable , unendurable , as it bores deeper and deeper and deeper into the listener 's brain , until at last the brain fever comes as a relief and the man dies .
Parsing [sent. 7037 len. 11]: I am bringing some of these birds home to America .
Parsing [sent. 7038 len. 22]: They will be a great curiosity there , and it is believed that in our climate they will multiply like rabbits .
Parsing [sent. 7039 len. 74]: The coppersmith bird 's note at a certain distance away has the ring of a sledge on granite ; at a certain other distance the hammering has a more metallic ring , and you might think that the bird was mending a copper kettle ; at another distance it has a more woodeny thump , but it is a thump that is full of energy , and sounds just like starting a bung .
Parsing [sent. 7040 len. 64]: So he is a hard bird to name with a single name ; he is a stone-breaker , coppersmith , and bung-starter , and even then he is not completely named , for when he is close by you find that there is a soft , deep , melodious quality in his thump , and for that no satisfying name occurs to you .
Parsing [sent. 7041 len. 82]: You will not mind his other notes , but when he camps near enough for you to hear that one , you presently find that his measured and monotonous repetition of it is beginning to disturb you ; next it will weary you , soon it will distress you , and before long each thump will hurt your head ; if this goes on , you will lose your mind with the pain and misery of it , and go crazy .
Parsing [sent. 7042 len. 11]: I am bringing some of these birds home to America .
Parsing [sent. 7043 len. 7]: There is nothing like them there .
Parsing [sent. 7044 len. 24]: They will be a great surprise , and it is said that in a climate like ours they will surpass expectation for fecundity .
Parsing [sent. 7045 len. 12]: I am bringing some nightingales , too , and some cue-owls .
Parsing [sent. 7046 len. 6]: I got them in Italy .
Parsing [sent. 7047 len. 12]: The song of the nightingale is the deadliest known to ornithology .
Parsing [sent. 7048 len. 9]: That demoniacal shriek can kill at thirty yards .
Parsing [sent. 7049 len. 21]: The note of the cue-owl is infinitely soft and sweet -- soft and sweet as the whisper of a flute .
Parsing [sent. 7050 len. 14]: But penetrating -- oh , beyond belief ; it can bore through boiler-iron .
Parsing [sent. 7051 len. 42]: It is a lingering note , and comes in triplets , on the one unchanging key : hoo-o-o , hoo-o-o , hoo-o-o ; then a silence of fifteen seconds , then the triplet again ; and so on , all night .
Parsing [sent. 7052 len. 35]: At first it is divine ; then less so ; then trying ; then distressing ; then excruciating ; then agonizing , and at the end of two hours the listener is a maniac .
Parsing [sent. 7053 len. 44]: And so , presently we took to the hand-car and went flying down the mountain again ; flying and stopping , flying and stopping , till at last we were in the plain once more and stowed for Calcutta in the regular train .
Parsing [sent. 7054 len. 13]: That was the most enjoyable day I have spent in the earth .
Parsing [sent. 7055 len. 23]: For rousing , tingling , rapturous pleasure there is no holiday trip that approaches the bird-flight down the Himalayas in a hand-car .
Parsing [sent. 7056 len. 25]: It has no fault , no blemish , no lack , except that there are only thirty-five miles of it instead of five hundred .
Parsing [sent. 7057 len. 3]: CHAPTER LVII .
Parsing [sent. 7058 len. 10]: She was not quite what you would call refined .
Parsing [sent. 7059 len. 10]: She was not quite what you would call unrefined .
Parsing [sent. 7060 len. 11]: She was the kind of person that keeps a parrot .
Parsing [sent. 7061 len. 9]: -- Pudd ` nhead Wilson 's New Calendar .
Parsing [sent. 7062 len. 36]: So far as I am able to judge , nothing has been left undone , either by man or Nature , to make India the most extraordinary country that the sun visits on his round .
Parsing [sent. 7063 len. 11]: Nothing seems to have been forgotten , nothing over looked .
Parsing [sent. 7064 len. 66]: Always , when you think you have come to the end of her tremendous specialties and have finished hanging tags upon her as the Land of the Thug , the Land of the Plague , the Land of Famine , the Land of Giant Illusions , the Land of Stupendous Mountains , and so forth , another specialty crops up and another tag is required .
Parsing [sent. 7065 len. 21]: I have been overlooking the fact that India is by an unapproachable supremacy -- the Land of Murderous Wild Creatures .
Parsing [sent. 7066 len. 24]: Perhaps it will be simplest to throw away the tags and generalize her with one all-comprehensive name , as the Land of Wonders .
Parsing [sent. 7067 len. 29]: For many years the British Indian Government has been trying to destroy the murderous wild creatures , and has spent a great deal of money in the effort .
Parsing [sent. 7068 len. 13]: The annual official returns show that the undertaking is a difficult one .
Parsing [sent. 7069 len. 44]: These returns exhibit a curious annual uniformity in results ; the sort of uniformity which you find in the annual output of suicides in the world 's capitals , and the proportions of deaths by this , that , and the other disease .
Parsing [sent. 7070 len. 65]: You can always come close to foretelling how many suicides will occur in Paris , London , and New York , next year , and also how many deaths will result from cancer , consumption , dog-bite , falling out of the window , getting run over by cabs , etc. , if you know the statistics of those matters for the present year .
Parsing [sent. 7071 len. 99]: In the same way , with one year 's Indian statistics before you , you can guess closely at how many people were killed in that Empire by tigers during the previous year , and the year before that , and the year before that , and at how many were killed in each of those years by bears , how many by wolves , and how many by snakes ; and you can also guess closely at how many people are going to be killed each year for the coming five years by each of those agencies .
Parsing [sent. 7072 len. 25]: You can also guess closely at how many of each agency the government is going to kill each year for the next five years .
Parsing [sent. 7073 len. 13]: I have before me statistics covering a period of six consecutive years .
Parsing [sent. 7074 len. 33]: By these , I know that in India the tiger kills something over 800 persons every year , and that the government responds by killing about double as many tigers every year .
Parsing [sent. 7075 len. 42]: In four of the six years referred to , the tiger got 800 odd ; in one of the remaining two years he got only 700 , but in the other remaining year he made his average good by scoring 917 .
Parsing [sent. 7076 len. 8]: He is always sure of his average .
Parsing [sent. 7077 len. 45]: Anyone who bets that the tiger will kill 2,400 people in India in any three consecutive years has invested his money in a certainty ; anyone who bets that he will kill 2,600 in any three consecutive years , is absolutely sure to lose .
Parsing [sent. 7078 len. 32]: As strikingly uniform as are the statistics of suicide , they are not any more so than are those of the tiger 's annual output of slaughtered human beings in India .
Parsing [sent. 7079 len. 18]: The government 's work is quite uniform , too ; it about doubles the tiger 's average .
Parsing [sent. 7080 len. 25]: In six years the tiger killed 5,000 persons , minus 50 ; in the same six years 10,000 tigers were killed , minus 400 .
Parsing [sent. 7081 len. 36]: The wolf kills nearly as many people as the tiger -- 700 a year to the tiger 's 800 odd -- but while he is doing it , more than 5,000 of his tribe fall .
Parsing [sent. 7082 len. 24]: The leopard kills an average of 230 people per year , but loses 3,300 of his own mess while he is doing it .
Parsing [sent. 7083 len. 17]: The bear kills 100 people per year at a cost of 1,250 of his own tribe .
Parsing [sent. 7084 len. 16]: The tiger , as the figures show , makes a very handsome fight against man .
Parsing [sent. 7085 len. 10]: But it is nothing to the elephant 's fight .
Parsing [sent. 7086 len. 32]: The king of beasts , the lord of the jungle , loses four of his mess per year , but he kills forty -- five persons to make up for it .
Parsing [sent. 7087 len. 17]: But when it comes to killing cattle , the lord of the jungle is not interested .
Parsing [sent. 7088 len. 71]: He kills but 100 in six years -- horses of hunters , no doubt -- but in the same six the tiger kills more than 84,000 , the leopard 100,000 , the bear 4,000 , the wolf 70,000 , the hyena more than 13,000 , other wild beasts 27,000 , and the snakes 19,000 , a grand total of more than 300,000 ; an average of 50,000 head per year .
Parsing [sent. 7089 len. 21]: In response , the government kills , in the six years , a total of 3,201,232 wild beasts and snakes .
Parsing [sent. 7090 len. 4]: Ten for one .
Parsing [sent. 7091 len. 22]: It will be perceived that the snakes are not much interested in cattle ; they kill only 3,000 odd per year .
Parsing [sent. 7092 len. 9]: The snakes are much more interested in man .
Parsing [sent. 7093 len. 6]: India swarms with deadly snakes .
Parsing [sent. 7094 len. 30]: At the head of the list is the cobra , the deadliest known to the world , a snake whose bite kills where the rattlesnake 's bite merely entertains .
Parsing [sent. 7095 len. 26]: In India , the annual man-killings by snakes are as uniform , as regular , and as forecastable as are the tiger-average and the suicide-average .
Parsing [sent. 7096 len. 49]: Anyone who bets that in India , in any three consecutive years the snakes will kill 49,500 persons , will win his bet ; and anyone who bets that in India in any three consecutive years , the snakes will kill 53,500 persons , will lose his bet .
Parsing [sent. 7097 len. 24]: In India the snakes kill 17,000 people a year ; they hardly ever fall short of it ; they as seldom exceed it .
Parsing [sent. 7098 len. 36]: An insurance actuary could take the Indian census tables and the government 's snake tables and tell you within sixpence how much it would be worth to insure a man against death by snake-bite there .
Parsing [sent. 7099 len. 38]: If I had a dollar for every person killed per year in India , I would rather have it than any other property , as it is the only property in the world not subject to shrinkage .
Parsing [sent. 7100 len. 58]: I should like to have a royalty on the government-end of the snake business , too , and am in London now trying to get it ; but when I get it it is not going to be as regular an income as the other will be if I get that ; I have applied for it .
Parsing [sent. 7101 len. 39]: The snakes transact their end of the business in a more orderly and systematic way than the government transacts its end of it , because the snakes have had a long experience and know all about the traffic .
Parsing [sent. 7102 len. 66]: You can make sure that the government will never kill fewer than 110,000 snakes in a year , and that it will newer quite reach 300,000 -- too much room for oscillation ; good speculative stock , to bear or bull , and buy and sell long and short , and all that kind of thing , but not eligible for investment like the other .
Parsing [sent. 7103 len. 15]: The man that speculates in the government 's snake crop wants to go carefully .
Parsing [sent. 7104 len. 29]: I would not advise a man to buy a single crop at all -- I mean a crop of futures for the possible wobble is something quite extraordinary .
Parsing [sent. 7105 len. 22]: If he can buy six future crops in a bunch , seller to deliver 1,500,000 altogether , that is another matter .
Parsing [sent. 7106 len. 38]: I do not know what snakes are worth now , but I know what they would be worth then , for the statistics show that the seller could not come within 427,000 of carrying out his contract .
Parsing [sent. 7107 len. 17]: However , I think that a person who speculates in snakes is a fool , anyway .
Parsing [sent. 7108 len. 6]: He always regrets it afterwards .
Parsing [sent. 7109 len. 5]: To finish the statistics .
Parsing [sent. 7110 len. 16]: In six years the wild beasts kill 20,000 persons , and the snakes kill 103,000 .
Parsing [sent. 7111 len. 10]: In the same six the government kills 1,073,546 snakes .
Parsing [sent. 7112 len. 3]: Plenty left .
Parsing [sent. 7113 len. 7]: There are narrow escapes in India .
Parsing [sent. 7114 len. 27]: In the very jungle where I killed sixteen tigers and all those elephants , a cobra bit me but it got well ; everyone was surprised .
Parsing [sent. 7115 len. 11]: This could not happen twice in ten years , perhaps .
Parsing [sent. 7116 len. 8]: Usually death would result in fifteen minutes .
Parsing [sent. 7117 len. 37]: We struck out westward or northwestward from Calcutta on an itinerary of a zig-zag sort , which would in the course of time carry us across India to its northwestern corner and the border of Afghanistan .
Parsing [sent. 7118 len. 100]: The first part of the trip carried us through a great region which was an endless garden -- miles and miles of the beautiful flower from whose juices comes the opium , and at Muzaffurpore we were in the midst of the indigo culture ; thence by a branch road to the Ganges at a point near Dinapore , and by a train which would have missed the connection by a week but for the thoughtfulness of some British officers who were along , and who knew the ways of trains that are run by natives without white supervision .
Parsing [sent. 7119 len. 16]: This train stopped at every village ; for no purpose connected with business , apparently .
Parsing [sent. 7120 len. 10]: We put out nothing , we took nothing aboard .
Parsing [sent. 7121 len. 26]: The train bands stepped ashore and gossiped with friends a quarter of an hour , then pulled out and repeated this at the succeeding villages .
Parsing [sent. 7122 len. 27]: We had thirty-five miles to go and six hours to do it in , but it was plain that we were not going to make it .
Parsing [sent. 7123 len. 21]: It was then that the English officers said it was now necessary to turn this gravel train into an express .
Parsing [sent. 7124 len. 13]: So they gave the engine-driver a rupee and told him to fly .
Parsing [sent. 7125 len. 6]: It was a simple remedy .
Parsing [sent. 7126 len. 9]: After that we made ninety miles an hour .
Parsing [sent. 7127 len. 60]: We crossed the Ganges just at dawn , made our connection , and went to Benares , where we stayed twenty-four hours and inspected that strange and fascinating piety-hive again ; then left for Lucknow , a city which is perhaps the most conspicuous of the many monuments of British fortitude and valor that are scattered about the earth .
Parsing [sent. 7128 len. 33]: The heat was pitiless , the flat plains were destitute of grass , and baked dry by the sun they were the color of pale dust , which was flying in clouds .
Parsing [sent. 7129 len. 21]: But it was much hotter than this when the relieving forces marched to Lucknow in the time of the Mutiny .
Parsing [sent. 7130 len. 8]: Those were the days of 138 deg .
Parsing [sent. 7131 len. 4]: in the shade .
Parsing [sent. 7132 len. 4]: CHAPTER , LVIII .
Parsing [sent. 7133 len. 17]: Make it a point to do something every day that you do n't want to do .
Parsing [sent. 7134 len. 16]: This is the golden rule for acquiring the habit of doing your duty without pain .
Parsing [sent. 7135 len. 9]: -- Pudd ` nhead Wilson 's New Calendar .
Parsing [sent. 7136 len. 54]: It seems to be settled , now , that among the many causes from which the Great Mutiny sprang , the main one was the annexation of the kingdom of Oudh by the East India Company -- characterized by Sir Henry Lawrence as `` the most unrighteous act that was ever committed . ''
Parsing [sent. 7137 len. 30]: In the spring of 1857 , a mutinous spirit was observable in many of the native garrisons , and it grew day by day and spread wider and wider .
Parsing [sent. 7138 len. 34]: The younger military men saw something very serious in it , and would have liked to take hold of it vigorously and stamp it out promptly ; but they were not in authority .
Parsing [sent. 7139 len. 38]: Old men were in the high places of the army -- men who should have been retired long before , because of their great age -- and they regarded the matter as a thing of no consequence .
Parsing [sent. 7140 len. 18]: They loved their native soldiers , and would not believe that anything could move them to revolt .
Parsing [sent. 7141 len. 21]: Everywhere these obstinate veterans listened serenely to the rumbling of the volcanoes under them , and said it was nothing .
Parsing [sent. 7142 len. 12]: And so the propagators of mutiny had everything their own way .
Parsing [sent. 7143 len. 35]: They moved from camp to camp undisturbed , and painted to the native soldier the wrongs his people were suffering at the hands of the English , and made his heart burn for revenge .
Parsing [sent. 7144 len. 57]: They were able to point to two facts of formidable value as backers of their persuasions : In Clive 's day , native armies were incoherent mobs , and without effective arms ; therefore , they were weak against Clive 's organized handful of well-armed men , but the thing was the other way , now .
Parsing [sent. 7145 len. 47]: The British forces were native ; they had been trained by the British , organized by the British , armed by the British , all the power was in their hands -- they were a club made by British hands to beat out British brains with .
Parsing [sent. 7146 len. 28]: There was nothing to oppose their mass , nothing but a few weak battalions of British soldiers scattered about India , a force not worth speaking of .
Parsing [sent. 7147 len. 55]: This argument , taken alone , might not have succeeded , for the bravest and best Indian troops had a wholesome dread of the white soldier , whether he was weak or strong ; but the agitators backed it with their second and best point -- prophecy -- a prophecy a hundred years old .
Parsing [sent. 7148 len. 21]: The Indian is open to prophecy at all times ; argument may fail to convince him , but not prophecy .
Parsing [sent. 7149 len. 37]: There was a prophecy that a hundred years from the year of that battle of Clive 's which founded the British Indian Empire , the British power would be overthrown and swept away by the natives .
Parsing [sent. 7150 len. 23]: The Mutiny broke out at Meerut on the 10th of May , 1857 , and fired a train of tremendous historical explosions .
Parsing [sent. 7151 len. 22]: Nana Sahib 's massacre of the surrendered garrison of Cawnpore occurred in June , and the long siege of Lucknow began .
Parsing [sent. 7152 len. 30]: The military history of England is old and great , but I think it must be granted that the crushing of the Mutiny is the greatest chapter in it .
Parsing [sent. 7153 len. 8]: The British were caught asleep and unprepared .
Parsing [sent. 7154 len. 15]: They were a few thousands , swallowed up in an ocean of hostile populations .
Parsing [sent. 7155 len. 72]: It would take months to inform England and get help , but they did not falter or stop to count the odds , but with English resolution and English devotion they took up their task , and went stubbornly on with it , through good fortune and bad , and fought the most unpromising fight that one may read of in fiction or out of it , and won it thoroughly .
Parsing [sent. 7156 len. 31]: The Mutiny broke out so suddenly , and spread with such rapidity that there was but little time for occupants of weak outlying stations to escape to places of safety .
Parsing [sent. 7157 len. 54]: Attempts were made , of course , but they were attended by hardships as bitter as death in the few cases which were successful ; for the heat ranged between 120 and 138 in the shade ; the way led through hostile peoples , and food and water were hardly to be had .
Parsing [sent. 7158 len. 22]: For ladies and children accustomed to ease and comfort and plenty , such a journey must have been a cruel experience .
Parsing [sent. 7159 len. 35]: Sir G. O. Trevelyan quotes an example : `` This is what befell Mrs. M -- , the wife of the surgeon at a certain station on the southern confines of the insurrection . '
Parsing [sent. 7160 len. 33]: I heard , ' she says , ' a number of shots fired , and , looking out , I saw my husband driving furiously from the mess-house , waving his whip .
Parsing [sent. 7161 len. 28]: I ran to him , and , seeing a bearer with my child in his arms , I caught her up , and got into the buggy .
Parsing [sent. 7162 len. 20]: At the mess-house we found all the officers assembled , together with sixty sepoys , who had remained faithful .
Parsing [sent. 7163 len. 17]: We went off in one large party , amidst a general conflagration of our late homes .
Parsing [sent. 7164 len. 16]: We reached the caravanserai at Chattapore the next morning , and thence started for Callinger .
Parsing [sent. 7165 len. 9]: At this point our sepoy escort deserted us .
Parsing [sent. 7166 len. 14]: We were fired upon by match-lockmen , and one officer was shot dead .
Parsing [sent. 7167 len. 24]: We heard , likewise , that the people had risen at Callinger , so we returned and walked back ten miles that day .
Parsing [sent. 7168 len. 9]: M -- and I carried the child alternately .
Parsing [sent. 7169 len. 7]: Presently Mrs. Smalley died of sunstroke .
Parsing [sent. 7170 len. 7]: We had no food amongst us .
Parsing [sent. 7171 len. 8]: An officer kindly lent us a horse .
Parsing [sent. 7172 len. 5]: We were very faint .
Parsing [sent. 7173 len. 15]: The Major died , and was buried ; also the Sergeant-major and some women .
Parsing [sent. 7174 len. 10]: The bandsmen left us on the nineteenth of June .
Parsing [sent. 7175 len. 14]: We were fired at again by match-lockmen , and changed direction for Allahabad .
Parsing [sent. 7176 len. 16]: Our party consisted of nine gentlemen , two children , the sergeant and his wife .
Parsing [sent. 7177 len. 16]: On the morning of the twentieth , Captain Scott took Lottie on to his horse .
Parsing [sent. 7178 len. 15]: I was riding behind my husband , and she was so crushed between us .
Parsing [sent. 7179 len. 12]: She was two years old on the first of the month .
Parsing [sent. 7180 len. 15]: We were both weak through want of food and the effect of the sun .
Parsing [sent. 7181 len. 8]: Lottie and I had no head covering .
Parsing [sent. 7182 len. 13]: M -- had a sepoy 's cap I found on the ground .
Parsing [sent. 7183 len. 14]: Soon after sunrise we were followed by villagers armed with clubs and spears .
Parsing [sent. 7184 len. 12]: One of them struck Captain Scott 's horse on the leg .
Parsing [sent. 7185 len. 16]: He galloped off with Lottie , and my poor husband never saw his child again .
Parsing [sent. 7186 len. 17]: We rode on several miles , keeping away from villages , and then crossed the river .
Parsing [sent. 7187 len. 5]: Our thirst was extreme .
Parsing [sent. 7188 len. 17]: M -- had dreadful cramps , so that I had to hold him on the horse .
Parsing [sent. 7189 len. 7]: I was very uneasy about him .
Parsing [sent. 7190 len. 27]: The day before I saw the drummer 's wife eating chupatties , and asked her to give a piece to the child , which she did .
Parsing [sent. 7191 len. 8]: I now saw water in a ravine .
Parsing [sent. 7192 len. 15]: The descent was steep , and our only drinking-vessel was M -- 's cap .
Parsing [sent. 7193 len. 11]: Our horse got water , and I bathed my neck .
Parsing [sent. 7194 len. 13]: I had no stockings , and my feet were torn and blistered .
Parsing [sent. 7195 len. 14]: Two peasants came in sight , and we were frightened and rode off .
Parsing [sent. 7196 len. 15]: The sergeant held our horse , and M -- put me up and mounted .
Parsing [sent. 7197 len. 26]: I think he must have got suddenly faint for I fell and he over me , on the road , when the horse started off .
Parsing [sent. 7198 len. 19]: Some time before he said , and Barber , too , that he could not live many hours .
Parsing [sent. 7199 len. 12]: I felt he was dying before we came to the ravine .
Parsing [sent. 7200 len. 15]: He told me his wishes about his children and myself , and took leave .
Parsing [sent. 7201 len. 6]: My brain seemed burnt up .
Parsing [sent. 7202 len. 4]: No tears came .
Parsing [sent. 7203 len. 25]: As soon as we fell , the sergeant let go the horse , and it went off ; so that escape was cut off .
Parsing [sent. 7204 len. 10]: We sat down on the ground waiting for death .
Parsing [sent. 7205 len. 3]: Poor fellow !
Parsing [sent. 7206 len. 18]: he was very weak ; his thirst was frightful , and I went to get him water .
Parsing [sent. 7207 len. 11]: Some villagers came , and took my rupees and watch .
Parsing [sent. 7208 len. 18]: I took off my wedding-ring , and twisted it in my hair , and replaced the guard .
Parsing [sent. 7209 len. 54]: I tore off the skirt of my dress to bring water in , but was no use , for when I returned my beloved 's eyes were fixed , and , though I called and tried to restore him , and poured water into his mouth , it only rattled in his throat .
Parsing [sent. 7210 len. 7]: He never spoke to me again .
Parsing [sent. 7211 len. 12]: I held him in my arms till he sank gradually down .
Parsing [sent. 7212 len. 9]: I felt frantic , but could not cry .
Parsing [sent. 7213 len. 4]: I was alone .
Parsing [sent. 7214 len. 19]: I bound his head and face in my dress , for there was no earth to bury him .
Parsing [sent. 7215 len. 10]: The pain in my hands and feet was dreadful .
Parsing [sent. 7216 len. 27]: I went down to the ravine , and sat in the water on a stone , hoping to get off at night and look for Lottie .
Parsing [sent. 7217 len. 32]: When I came back from the water , I saw that they had not taken her little watch , chain , and seals , so I tied them under my petticoat .
Parsing [sent. 7218 len. 29]: In an hour , about thirty villagers came , they dragged me out of the ravine , and took off my jacket , and found the little chain .
Parsing [sent. 7219 len. 25]: They then dragged me to a village , mocking me all the way , and disputing as to whom I was to belong to .
Parsing [sent. 7220 len. 9]: The whole population came to look at me .
Parsing [sent. 7221 len. 16]: I asked for a bedstead , and lay down outside the door of a hut .
Parsing [sent. 7222 len. 13]: They had a dozen of cows , and yet refused me milk .
Parsing [sent. 7223 len. 20]: When night came , and the village was quiet , some old woman brought me a leafful of rice .
Parsing [sent. 7224 len. 13]: I was too parched to eat , and they gave me water .
Parsing [sent. 7225 len. 34]: The morning after a neighboring Rajah sent a palanquin and a horseman to fetch me , who told me that a little child and three Sahibs had come to his master 's house .
Parsing [sent. 7226 len. 19]: And so the poor mother found her lost one , ` greatly blistered , ' poor little creature .
Parsing [sent. 7227 len. 19]: It is not for Europeans in India to pray that their flight be not in the winter . ''
Parsing [sent. 7228 len. 51]: In the first days of June the aged general , Sir Hugh Wheeler commanding the forces at Cawnpore , was deserted by his native troops ; then he moved out of the fort and into an exposed patch of open flat ground and built a four-foot mud wall around it .
Parsing [sent. 7229 len. 21]: He had with him a few hundred white soldiers and officers , and apparently more women and children than soldiers .
Parsing [sent. 7230 len. 29]: He was short of provisions , short of arms , short of ammunition , short of military wisdom , short of everything but courage and devotion to duty .
Parsing [sent. 7231 len. 61]: The defense of that open lot through twenty-one days and nights of hunger , thirst , Indian heat , and a never-ceasing storm of bullets , bombs , and cannon-balls -- a defense conducted , not by the aged and infirm general , but by a young officer named Moore -- is one of the most heroic episodes in history .
Parsing [sent. 7232 len. 29]: When at last the Nana found it impossible to conquer these starving men and women with powder and ball , he resorted to treachery , and that succeeded .
Parsing [sent. 7233 len. 15]: He agreed to supply them with food and send them to Allahabad in boats .
Parsing [sent. 7234 len. 59]: Their mud wall and their barracks were in ruins , their provisions were at the point of exhaustion , they had done all that the brave could do , they had conquered an honorable compromise , -- their forces had been fearfully reduced by casualties and by disease , they were not able to continue the contest longer .
Parsing [sent. 7235 len. 28]: They came forth helpless but suspecting no treachery , the Nana 's host closed around them , and at a signal from a trumpet the massacre began .
Parsing [sent. 7236 len. 24]: About two hundred women and children were spared -- for the present -- but all the men except three or four were killed .
Parsing [sent. 7237 len. 78]: Among the incidents of the massacre quoted by Sir G. O. Trevelyan , is this : `` When , after the lapse of some twenty minutes , the dead began to outnumber the living ; -- when the fire slackened , as the marks grew few and far between ; then the troopers who had been drawn up to the right of the temple plunged into the river , sabre between teeth , and pistol in hand .
Parsing [sent. 7238 len. 28]: Thereupon two half-caste Christian women , the wives of musicians in the band of the Fifty-sixth , witnessed a scene which should not be related at second-hand .
Parsing [sent. 7239 len. 30]: ` In the boat where I was to have gone , ' says Mrs. Bradshaw , confirmed throughout by Mrs. Setts , ` was the school-mistress and twenty-two misses .
Parsing [sent. 7240 len. 8]: General Wheeler came last in a palkee .
Parsing [sent. 7241 len. 10]: They carried him into the water near the boat .
Parsing [sent. 7242 len. 5]: I stood close by .
Parsing [sent. 7243 len. 14]: He said , ` Carry me a little further towards the boat . '
Parsing [sent. 7244 len. 13]: But a trooper said , ` No , get out here . '
Parsing [sent. 7245 len. 31]: As the General got out of the palkee , head-foremost , the trooper gave him a cut with his sword into the neck , and he fell into the water .
Parsing [sent. 7246 len. 7]: My son was killed near him .
Parsing [sent. 7247 len. 6]: I saw it ; alas !
Parsing [sent. 7248 len. 2]: alas !
Parsing [sent. 7249 len. 10]: Some were stabbed with bayonets ; others cut down .
Parsing [sent. 7250 len. 7]: Little infants were torn in pieces .
Parsing [sent. 7251 len. 15]: We saw it ; we did ; and tell you only what we saw .
Parsing [sent. 7252 len. 10]: Other children were stabbed and thrown into the river .
Parsing [sent. 7253 len. 7]: The schoolgirls were burnt to death .
Parsing [sent. 7254 len. 9]: I saw their clothes and hair catch fire .
Parsing [sent. 7255 len. 23]: In the water , a few paces off , by the next boat , we saw the youngest daughter of Colonel Williams .
Parsing [sent. 7256 len. 11]: A sepoy was going to kill her with his bayonet .
Parsing [sent. 7257 len. 13]: She said , ` My father was always kind to sepoys . '
Parsing [sent. 7258 len. 25]: He turned away , and just then a villager struck her on the head with a club , and she fell into the water .
Parsing [sent. 7259 len. 41]: These people likewise saw good Mr. Moncrieff , the clergyman , take a book from his pocket that he never had leisure to open , and heard him commence a prayer for mercy which he was not permitted to conclude .
Parsing [sent. 7260 len. 37]: Another deponent observed an European making for a drain like a scared water-rat , when some boatmen , armed with cudgels , cut off his retreat , and beat him down dead into the mud . ''
Parsing [sent. 7261 len. 37]: The women and children who had been reserved from the massacre were imprisoned during a fortnight in a small building , one story high -- a cramped place , a slightly modified Black Hole of Calcutta .
Parsing [sent. 7262 len. 15]: They were waiting in suspense ; there was none who could forecast their fate .
Parsing [sent. 7263 len. 34]: Meantime the news of the massacre had traveled far and an army of rescuers with Havelock at its head was on its way -- at least an army which hoped to be rescuers .
Parsing [sent. 7264 len. 33]: It was crossing the country by forced marches , and strewing its way with its own dead -- men struck down by cholera , and by a heat which reached 135 deg .
Parsing [sent. 7265 len. 26]: It was in a vengeful fury , and it stopped for nothing -- neither heat , nor fatigue , nor disease , nor human opposition .
Parsing [sent. 7266 len. 27]: It tore its impetuous way through hostile forces , winning victory after victory , but still striding on and on , not halting to count results .
Parsing [sent. 7267 len. 32]: And at last , after this extraordinary march , it arrived before the walls of Cawnpore , met the Nana 's massed strength , delivered a crushing defeat , and entered .
Parsing [sent. 7268 len. 11]: But too late -- only a few hours too late .
Parsing [sent. 7269 len. 32]: For at the last moment the Nana had decided upon the massacre of the captive women and children , and had commissioned three Mohammedans and two Hindoos to do the work .
Parsing [sent. 7270 len. 13]: Sir G. O. Trevelyan says : `` Thereupon the five men entered .
Parsing [sent. 7271 len. 17]: It was the short gloaming of Hindostan -- the hour when ladies take their evening drive .
Parsing [sent. 7272 len. 12]: She who had accosted the officer was standing in the doorway .
Parsing [sent. 7273 len. 11]: With her were the native doctor and two Hindoo menials .
Parsing [sent. 7274 len. 22]: That much of the business might be seen from the veranda , but all else was concealed amidst the interior gloom .
Parsing [sent. 7275 len. 14]: Shrieks and scuffling acquainted those without that the journeymen were earning their hire .
Parsing [sent. 7276 len. 13]: Survur Khan soon emerged with his sword broken off at the hilt .
Parsing [sent. 7277 len. 21]: He procured another from the Nana 's house , and a few minutes after appeared again on the same errand .
Parsing [sent. 7278 len. 19]: The third blade was of better temper ; or perhaps the thick of the work was already over .
Parsing [sent. 7279 len. 21]: By the time darkness had closed in , the men came forth and locked up the house for the night .
Parsing [sent. 7280 len. 12]: Then the screams ceased , but the groans lasted till morning .
Parsing [sent. 7281 len. 7]: `` The sun rose as usual .
Parsing [sent. 7282 len. 20]: When he had been up nearly three hours the five repaired to the scene of their labors over night .
Parsing [sent. 7283 len. 30]: They were attended by a few sweepers , who proceeded to transfer the contents of the house to a dry well situated behind some trees which grew hard by .
Parsing [sent. 7284 len. 27]: ` The bodies , ' says one who was present throughout , ` were dragged out , most of them by the hair of the head .
Parsing [sent. 7285 len. 9]: Those who had clothing worth taking were stripped .
Parsing [sent. 7286 len. 7]: Some of the women were alive .
Parsing [sent. 7287 len. 12]: I can not say how many ; but three could speak .
Parsing [sent. 7288 len. 17]: They prayed for the sake of God that an end might be put to their sufferings .
Parsing [sent. 7289 len. 24]: I remarked one very stout woman , a half-caste , who was severely wounded in both arms , who entreated to be killed .
Parsing [sent. 7290 len. 23]: She and two or three others were placed against the bank of the cut by which bullocks go down in drawing water .
Parsing [sent. 7291 len. 7]: The dead were first thrown in .
Parsing [sent. 7292 len. 20]: Yes : there was a great crowd looking on ; they were standing along the walls of the compound .
Parsing [sent. 7293 len. 8]: They were principally city people and villagers .
Parsing [sent. 7294 len. 7]: Yes : there were also sepoys .
Parsing [sent. 7295 len. 5]: Three boys were alive .
Parsing [sent. 7296 len. 5]: They were fair children .
Parsing [sent. 7297 len. 19]: The eldest , I think , must have been six or seven , and the youngest five years .
Parsing [sent. 7298 len. 15]: They were running around the well -LRB- where else could they go to ? -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 7299 len. 9]: , and there was none to save them .
Parsing [sent. 7300 len. 13]: No : none said a word or tried to save them . '
Parsing [sent. 7301 len. 15]: `` At length the smallest of them made an infantile attempt to get away .
Parsing [sent. 7302 len. 18]: The little thing had been frightened past bearing by the murder of one of the surviving ladies .
Parsing [sent. 7303 len. 19]: He thus attracted the observation of a native who flung him and his companions down the well . ''
Parsing [sent. 7304 len. 38]: The soldiers had made a march of eighteen days , almost without rest , to save the women and the children , and now they were too late -- all were dead and the assassin had flown .
Parsing [sent. 7305 len. 11]: What happened then , Trevelyan hesitated to put into words .
Parsing [sent. 7306 len. 14]: `` Of what took place , the less said is the better . ''
Parsing [sent. 7307 len. 17]: Then he continues : `` But there was a spectacle to witness which might excuse much .
Parsing [sent. 7308 len. 33]: Those who , straight from the contested field , wandered sobbing through the rooms of the ladies ' house , saw what it were well could the outraged earth have straightway hidden .
Parsing [sent. 7309 len. 8]: The inner apartment was ankle-deep in blood .
Parsing [sent. 7310 len. 36]: The plaster was scored with sword-cuts ; not high up as where men have fought , but low down , and about the corners , as if a creature had crouched to avoid the blow .
Parsing [sent. 7311 len. 31]: Strips of dresses , vainly tied around the handles of the doors , signified the contrivance to which feminine despair had resorted as a means of keeping out the murderers .
Parsing [sent. 7312 len. 43]: Broken combs were there , and the frills of children 's trousers , and torn cuffs and pinafores , and little round hats , and one or two shoes with burst latchets , and one or two daguerreotype cases with cracked glasses .
Parsing [sent. 7313 len. 52]: An officer picked up a few curls , preserved in a bit of cardboard , and marked ` Ned 's hair , with love ' ; but around were strewn locks , some near a yard in length , dissevered , not as a keepsake , by quite other scissors . ''
Parsing [sent. 7314 len. 14]: The battle of Waterloo was fought on the 18th of June , 1815 .
Parsing [sent. 7315 len. 19]: I do not state this fact as a reminder to the reader , but as news to him .
Parsing [sent. 7316 len. 11]: For a forgotten fact is news when it comes again .
Parsing [sent. 7317 len. 37]: Writers of books have the fashion of whizzing by vast and renowned historical events with the remark , `` The details of this tremendous episode are too familiar to the reader to need repeating here . ''
Parsing [sent. 7318 len. 8]: They know that that is not true .
Parsing [sent. 7319 len. 8]: It is a low kind of flattery .
Parsing [sent. 7320 len. 32]: They know that the reader has forgotten every detail of it , and that nothing of the tremendous event is left in his mind but a vague and formless luminous smudge .
Parsing [sent. 7321 len. 21]: Aside from the desire to flatter the reader , they have another reason for making the remark-two reasons , indeed .
Parsing [sent. 7322 len. 57]: They do not remember the details themselves , and do not want the trouble of hunting them up and copying them out ; also , they are afraid that if they search them out and print them they will be scoffed at by the book-reviewers for retelling those worn old things which are familiar to everybody .
Parsing [sent. 7323 len. 32]: They should not mind the reviewer 's jeer ; he does n't remember any of the worn old things until the book which he is reviewing has retold them to him .
Parsing [sent. 7324 len. 34]: I have made the quoted remark myself , at one time and another , but I was not doing it to flatter the reader ; I was merely doing it to save work .
Parsing [sent. 7325 len. 56]: If I had known the details without brushing up , I would have put them in ; but I did n't , and I did not want the labor of posting myself ; so I said , `` The details of this tremendous episode are too familiar to the reader to need repeating here . ''
Parsing [sent. 7326 len. 17]: I do not like that kind of a lie ; still , it does save work .
Parsing [sent. 7327 len. 54]: I am not trying to get out of repeating the details of the Siege of Lucknow in fear of the reviewer ; I am not leaving them out in fear that they would not interest the reader ; I am leaving them out partly to save work ; mainly for lack of room .
Parsing [sent. 7328 len. 20]: It is a pity , too ; for there is not a dull place anywhere in the great story .
Parsing [sent. 7329 len. 37]: Ten days before the outbreak -LRB- May 10th -RRB- of the Mutiny , all was serene at Lucknow , the huge capital of Oudh , the kingdom which had recently been seized by the India Company .
Parsing [sent. 7330 len. 19]: There was a great garrison , composed of about 7,000 native troops and between 700 and 800 whites .
Parsing [sent. 7331 len. 42]: These white soldiers and their families were probably the only people of their race there ; at their elbow was that swarming population of warlike natives , a race of born soldiers , brave , daring , and fond of fighting .
Parsing [sent. 7332 len. 26]: On high ground just outside the city stood the palace of that great personage , the Resident , the representative of British power and authority .
Parsing [sent. 7333 len. 35]: It stood in the midst of spacious grounds , with its due complement of outbuildings , and the grounds were enclosed by a wall -- a wall not for defense , but for privacy .
Parsing [sent. 7334 len. 22]: The mutinous spirit was in the air , but the whites were not afraid , and did not feel much troubled .
Parsing [sent. 7335 len. 71]: Then came the outbreak at Meerut , then the capture of Delhi by the mutineers ; in June came the three-weeks leaguer of Sir Hugh Wheeler in his open lot at Cawnpore -- 40 miles distant from Lucknow -- then the treacherous massacre of that gallant little garrison ; and now the great revolt was in full flower , and the comfortable condition of things at Lucknow was instantly changed .
Parsing [sent. 7336 len. 40]: There was an outbreak there , and Sir Henry Lawrence marched out of the Residency on the 30th of June to put it down , but was defeated with heavy loss , and had difficulty in getting back again .
Parsing [sent. 7337 len. 17]: That night the memorable siege of the Residency -- called the siege of Lucknow -- began .
Parsing [sent. 7338 len. 16]: Sir Henry was killed three days later , and Brigadier Inglis succeeded him in command .
Parsing [sent. 7339 len. 34]: Outside of the Residency fence was an immense host of hostile and confident native besiegers ; inside it were 480 loyal native soldiers , 730 white ones , and 500 women and children .
Parsing [sent. 7340 len. 17]: In those days the English garrisons always managed to hamper themselves sufficiently with women and children .
Parsing [sent. 7341 len. 46]: The natives established themselves in houses close at hand and began to rain bullets and cannon-balls into the Residency ; and this they kept up , night and day , during four months and a half , the little garrison industriously replying all the time .
Parsing [sent. 7342 len. 22]: The women and children soon became so used to the roar of the guns that it ceased to disturb their sleep .
Parsing [sent. 7343 len. 10]: The children imitated siege and defense in their play .
Parsing [sent. 7344 len. 19]: The women -- with any pretext , or with none -- would sally out into the storm-swept grounds .
Parsing [sent. 7345 len. 86]: The defense was kept up week after week , with stubborn fortitude , in the midst of death , which came in many forms -- by bullet , small-pox , cholera , and by various diseases induced by unpalatable and insufficient food , by the long hours of wearying and exhausting overwork in the daily and nightly battle in the oppressive Indian heat , and by the broken rest caused by the intolerable pest of mosquitoes , flies , mice , rats , and fleas .
Parsing [sent. 7346 len. 31]: Six weeks after the beginning of the siege more than one-half of the original force of white soldiers was dead , and close upon three-fifths of the original native force .
Parsing [sent. 7347 len. 9]: But the fighting went on just the same .
Parsing [sent. 7348 len. 21]: The enemy mined , the English counter-mined , and , turn about , they blew up each other 's posts .
Parsing [sent. 7349 len. 11]: The Residency grounds were honey-combed with the enemy 's tunnels .
Parsing [sent. 7350 len. 43]: Deadly courtesies were constantly exchanged -- sorties by the English in the night ; rushes by the enemy in the night -- rushes whose purpose was to breach the walls or scale them ; rushes which cost heavily , and always failed .
Parsing [sent. 7351 len. 24]: The ladies got used to all the horrors of war -- the shrieks of mutilated men , the sight of blood and death .
Parsing [sent. 7352 len. 26]: Lady Inglis makes this mention in her diary : `` Mrs. Bruere 's nurse was carried past our door to-day , wounded in the eye .
Parsing [sent. 7353 len. 18]: To extract the bullet it was found necessary to take out the eye -- a fearful operation .
Parsing [sent. 7354 len. 10]: Her mistress held her while it was performed . ''
Parsing [sent. 7355 len. 8]: The first relieving force failed to relieve .
Parsing [sent. 7356 len. 20]: It was under Havelock and Outram ; and arrived when the siege had been going on for three months .
Parsing [sent. 7357 len. 44]: It fought its desperate way to Lucknow , then fought its way through the city against odds of a hundred to one , and entered the Residency ; but there was not enough left of it , then , to do any good .
Parsing [sent. 7358 len. 19]: It lost more men in its last fight than it found in the Residency when it got in .
Parsing [sent. 7359 len. 5]: It became captive itself .
Parsing [sent. 7360 len. 14]: The fighting and starving and dying by bullets and disease went steadily on .
Parsing [sent. 7361 len. 8]: Both sides fought with energy and industry .
Parsing [sent. 7362 len. 9]: Captain Birch puts this striking incident in evidence .
Parsing [sent. 7363 len. 46]: He is speaking of the third month of the siege : `` As an instance of the heavy firing brought to bear on our position this month may be mentioned the cutting down of the upper story of a brick building simply by musketry firing .
Parsing [sent. 7364 len. 9]: This building was in a most exposed position .
Parsing [sent. 7365 len. 37]: All the shots which just missed the top of the rampart cut into the dead wall pretty much in a straight line , and at length cut right through and brought the upper story tumbling down .
Parsing [sent. 7366 len. 13]: The upper structure on the top of the brigade-mess also fell in .
Parsing [sent. 7367 len. 7]: The Residency house was a wreck .
Parsing [sent. 7368 len. 19]: Captain Anderson 's post had long ago been knocked down , and Innes ' post also fell in .
Parsing [sent. 7369 len. 8]: These two were riddled with round shot .
Parsing [sent. 7370 len. 12]: As many as 200 were picked up by Colonel Masters . ''
Parsing [sent. 7371 len. 14]: The exhausted garrison fought doggedly on all through the next month -- October .
Parsing [sent. 7372 len. 22]: Then , November 2d , news came Sir Colin Campbell 's relieving force would soon be on its way from Cawnpore .
Parsing [sent. 7373 len. 11]: On the 12th the boom of his guns was heard .
Parsing [sent. 7374 len. 26]: On the 13th the sounds came nearer -- he was slowly , but steadily , cutting his way through , storming one stronghold after another .
Parsing [sent. 7375 len. 17]: On the 14th he captured the Martiniere College , and ran up the British flag there .
Parsing [sent. 7376 len. 7]: It was seen from the Residency .
Parsing [sent. 7377 len. 6]: Next he took the Dilkoosha .
Parsing [sent. 7378 len. 21]: On the 17th he took the former mess-house of the 32d regiment -- a fortified building , and very strong .
Parsing [sent. 7379 len. 16]: `` A most exciting , anxious day , '' writes Lady Inglis in her diary .
Parsing [sent. 7380 len. 51]: `` About 4 P.M. , two strange officers walked through our yard , leading their horses '' -- and by that sign she knew that communication was established between the forces , that the relief was real , this time , and that the long siege of Lucknow was ended .
Parsing [sent. 7381 len. 18]: The last eight or ten miles of Sir Colin Campbell 's march was through seas of blood .
Parsing [sent. 7382 len. 13]: The weapon mainly used was the bayonet , the fighting was desperate .
Parsing [sent. 7383 len. 26]: The way was mile-stoned with detached strong buildings of stone , fortified , and heavily garrisoned , and these had to be taken by assault .
Parsing [sent. 7384 len. 11]: Neither side asked for quarter , and neither gave it .
Parsing [sent. 7385 len. 32]: At the Secundrabagh , where nearly two thousand of the enemy occupied a great stone house in a garden , the work of slaughter was continued until every man was killed .
Parsing [sent. 7386 len. 12]: That is a sample of the character of that devastating march .
Parsing [sent. 7387 len. 58]: There were but few trees in the plain at that time , and from the Residency the progress of the march , step by step , victory by victory , could be noted ; the ascending clouds of battle-smoke marked the way to the eye , and the thunder of the guns marked it to the ear .
Parsing [sent. 7388 len. 26]: Sir Colin Campbell had not come to Lucknow to hold it , but to save the occupants of the Residency , and bring them away .
Parsing [sent. 7389 len. 35]: Four or five days after his arrival the secret evacuation by the troops took place , in the middle of a dark night , by the principal gate , -LRB- the Bailie Guard -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 7390 len. 15]: The two hundred women and two hundred and fifty children had been previously removed .
Parsing [sent. 7391 len. 39]: Captain Birch says : `` And now commenced a movement of the most perfect arrangement and successful generalship -- the withdrawal of the whole of the various forces , a combined movement requiring the greatest care and skill .
Parsing [sent. 7392 len. 22]: First , the garrison in immediate contact with the enemy at the furthest extremity of the Residency position was marched out .
Parsing [sent. 7393 len. 29]: Every other garrison in turn fell in behind it , and so passed out through the Bailie Guard gate , till the whole of our position was evacuated .
Parsing [sent. 7394 len. 19]: Then Havelock 's force was similarly withdrawn , post by post , marching in rear of our garrison .
Parsing [sent. 7395 len. 22]: After them in turn came the forces of the Commander-in-Chief , which joined on in the rear of Havelock 's force .
Parsing [sent. 7396 len. 12]: Regiment by regiment was withdrawn with the utmost order and regularity .
Parsing [sent. 7397 len. 10]: The whole operation resembled the movement of a telescope .
Parsing [sent. 7398 len. 13]: Stern silence was kept , and the enemy took no alarm . ''
Parsing [sent. 7399 len. 97]: Lady Inglis , referring to her husband and to General Sir James Outram , sets down the closing detail of this impressive midnight retreat , in darkness and by stealth , of this shadowy host through the gate which it had defended so long and so well : `` At twelve precisely they marched out , John and Sir James Outram remaining till all had passed , and then they took off their hats to the Bailie Guard , the scene of as noble a defense as I think history will ever have to relate . ''
Parsing [sent. 7400 len. 3]: CHAPTER LIX .
Parsing [sent. 7401 len. 7]: Do n't part with your illusions .
Parsing [sent. 7402 len. 15]: When they are gone you may still exist but you have ceased to live .
Parsing [sent. 7403 len. 9]: -- Pudd ` nhead Wilson 's New Calendar .
Parsing [sent. 7404 len. 15]: Often , the surest way to convey misinformation is to tell the strict truth .
Parsing [sent. 7405 len. 9]: -- Pudd ` nhead Wilson 's New Calendar .
Parsing [sent. 7406 len. 108]: We were driven over Sir Colin Campbell 's route by a British officer , and when I arrived at the Residency I was so familiar with the road that I could have led a retreat over it myself ; but the compass in my head has been out of order from my birth , and so , as soon as I was within the battered Bailie Guard and turned about to review the march and imagine the relieving forces storming their way along it , everything was upside down and wrong end first in a moment , and I was never able to get straightened out again .
Parsing [sent. 7407 len. 14]: And now , when I look at the battle-plan , the confusion remains .
Parsing [sent. 7408 len. 25]: In me the east was born west , the battle-plans which have the east on the right-hand side are of no use to me .
Parsing [sent. 7409 len. 15]: The Residency ruins are draped with flowering vines , and are impressive and beautiful .
Parsing [sent. 7410 len. 30]: They and the grounds are sacred now , and will suffer no neglect nor be profaned by any sordid or commercial use while the British remain masters of India .
Parsing [sent. 7411 len. 18]: Within the grounds are buried the dead who gave up their lives there in the long siege .
Parsing [sent. 7412 len. 60]: After a fashion , I was able to imagine the fiery storm that raged night and day over the place during so many months , and after a fashion I could imagine the men moving through it , but I could not satisfactorily place the 200 women , and I could do nothing at all with the 250 children .
Parsing [sent. 7413 len. 79]: I knew by Lady Inglis ' diary that the children carried on their small affairs very much as if blood and carnage and the crash and thunder of a siege were natural and proper features of nursery life , and I tried to realize it ; but when her little Johnny came rushing , all excitement , through the din and smoke , shouting , `` Oh , mamma , the white hen has laid an egg ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7414 len. 9]: I saw that I could not do it .
Parsing [sent. 7415 len. 8]: Johnny 's place was under the bed .
Parsing [sent. 7416 len. 45]: I could imagine him there , because I could imagine myself there ; and I think I should not have been interested in a hen that was laying an egg ; my interest would have been with the parties that were laying the bombshells .
Parsing [sent. 7417 len. 104]: I sat at dinner with one of those children in the Club 's Indian palace , and I knew that all through the siege he was perfecting his teething and learning to talk ; and while to me he was the most impressive object in Lucknow after the Residency ruins , I was not able to imagine what his life had been during that tempestuous infancy of his , nor what sort of a curious surprise it must have been to him to be marched suddenly out into a strange dumb world where there was n't any noise , and nothing going on .
Parsing [sent. 7418 len. 27]: He was only forty-one when I saw him , a strangely youthful link to connect the present with so ancient an episode as the Great Mutiny .
Parsing [sent. 7419 len. 54]: By and by we saw Cawnpore , and the open lot which was the scene of Moore 's memorable defense , and the spot on the shore of the Ganges where the massacre of the betrayed garrison occurred , and the small Indian temple whence the bugle-signal notified the assassins to fall on .
Parsing [sent. 7420 len. 10]: This latter was a lonely spot , and silent .
Parsing [sent. 7421 len. 9]: The sluggish river drifted by , almost currentless .
Parsing [sent. 7422 len. 89]: It was dead low water , narrow channels with vast sandbars between , all the way across the wide bed ; and the only living thing in sight was that grotesque and solemn bald-headed bird , the Adjutant , standing on his six-foot stilts , solitary on a distant bar , with his head sunk between his shoulders , thinking ; thinking of his prize , I suppose -- the dead Hindoo that lay awash at his feet , and whether to eat him alone or invite friends .
Parsing [sent. 7423 len. 13]: He and his prey were a proper accent to that mournful place .
Parsing [sent. 7424 len. 15]: They were in keeping with it , they emphasized its loneliness and its solemnity .
Parsing [sent. 7425 len. 31]: And we saw the scene of the slaughter of the helpless women and children , and also the costly memorial that is built over the well which contains their remains .
Parsing [sent. 7426 len. 42]: The Black Hole of Calcutta is gone , but a more reverent age is come , and whatever remembrancer still exists of the moving and heroic sufferings and achievements of the garrisons of Lucknow and Cawnpore will be guarded and preserved .
Parsing [sent. 7427 len. 74]: In Agra and its neighborhood , and afterwards at Delhi , we saw forts , mosques , and tombs , which were built in the great days of the Mohammedan emperors , and which are marvels of cost , magnitude , and richness of materials and ornamentation , creations of surpassing grandeur , wonders which do indeed make the like things in the rest of the world seem tame and inconsequential by comparison .
Parsing [sent. 7428 len. 8]: I am not purposing to describe them .
Parsing [sent. 7429 len. 39]: By good fortune I had not read too much about them , and therefore was able to get a natural and rational focus upon them , with the result that they thrilled , blessed , and exalted me .
Parsing [sent. 7430 len. 25]: But if I had previously overheated my imagination by drinking too much pestilential literary hot Scotch , I should have suffered disappointment and sorrow .
Parsing [sent. 7431 len. 25]: I mean to speak of only one of these many world-renowned buildings , the Taj Mahal , the most celebrated construction in the earth .
Parsing [sent. 7432 len. 11]: I had read a great deal too much about it .
Parsing [sent. 7433 len. 66]: I saw it in the daytime , I saw it in the moonlight , I saw it near at hand , I saw it from a distance ; and I knew all the time , that of its kind it was the wonder of THE world , with no competitor now and no possible future competitor ; and yet , it was not MY Taj .
Parsing [sent. 7434 len. 26]: My Taj had been built by excitable literary people ; it was solidly lodged in my head , and I could not blast it out .
Parsing [sent. 7435 len. 30]: I wish to place before the reader some of the usual descriptions of the Taj , and ask him to take note of the impressions left in his mind .
Parsing [sent. 7436 len. 18]: These descriptions do really state the truth -- as nearly as the limitations of language will allow .
Parsing [sent. 7437 len. 62]: But language is a treacherous thing , a most unsure vehicle , and it can seldom arrange descriptive words in such a way that they will not inflate the facts -- by help of the reader 's imagination , which is always ready to take a hand , and work for nothing , and do the bulk of it at that .
Parsing [sent. 7438 len. 19]: I will begin with a few sentences from the excellent little local guide-book of Mr. Satya Chandra Mukerji .
Parsing [sent. 7439 len. 44]: I take them from here and there in his description : `` The inlaid work of the Taj and the flowers and petals that are to be found on all sides on the surface of the marble evince a most delicate touch . ''
Parsing [sent. 7440 len. 4]: That is true .
Parsing [sent. 7441 len. 38]: `` The inlaid work , the marble , the flowers , the buds , the leaves , the petals , and the lotus stems are almost without a rival in the whole of the civilized world . ''
Parsing [sent. 7442 len. 20]: `` The work of inlaying with stones and gems is found in the highest perfection in the Taj . ''
Parsing [sent. 7443 len. 16]: Gems , inlaid flowers , buds , and leaves to be found on all sides .
Parsing [sent. 7444 len. 7]: What do you see before you ?
Parsing [sent. 7445 len. 6]: Is the fairy structure growing ?
Parsing [sent. 7446 len. 7]: Is it becoming a jewel casket ?
Parsing [sent. 7447 len. 18]: `` The whole of the Taj produces a wonderful effect that is equally sublime and beautiful . ''
Parsing [sent. 7448 len. 29]: Then Sir William Wilson Hunter : `` The Taj Mahal with its beautiful domes , ' a dream of marble , ' rises on the river bank . ''
Parsing [sent. 7449 len. 11]: `` The materials are white marble and red sandstone . ''
Parsing [sent. 7450 len. 17]: `` The complexity of its design and the delicate intricacy of the workmanship baffle description . ''
Parsing [sent. 7451 len. 4]: Sir William continues .
Parsing [sent. 7452 len. 36]: I will italicize some of his words : `` The mausoleum stands on a raised marble platform at each of whose corners rises a tall and slender minaret of graceful proportions and of exquisite beauty .
Parsing [sent. 7453 len. 20]: Beyond the platform stretch the two wings , one of which is itself a mosque of great architectural merit .
Parsing [sent. 7454 len. 29]: In the center of the whole design the mausoleum occupies a square of 186 feet , with the angles deeply truncated so as to form an unequal octagon .
Parsing [sent. 7455 len. 35]: The main feature in this central pile is the great dome , which swells upward to nearly two-thirds of a sphere and tapers at its extremity into a pointed spire crowned by a crescent .
Parsing [sent. 7456 len. 21]: Beneath it an enclosure of marble trellis-work surrounds the tomb of the princess and of her husband , the Emperor .
Parsing [sent. 7457 len. 24]: Each corner of the mausoleum is covered by a similar though much smaller dome erected on a pediment pierced with graceful Saracenic arches .
Parsing [sent. 7458 len. 34]: Light is admitted into the interior through a double screen of pierced marble , which tempers the glare of an Indian sky while its whiteness prevents the mellow effect from degenerating into gloom .
Parsing [sent. 7459 len. 33]: The internal decorations consist of inlaid work in precious stones , such as agate , jasper , etc. , with which every squandril or salient point in the architecture is richly fretted .
Parsing [sent. 7460 len. 23]: Brown and violet marble is also freely employed in wreaths , scrolls , and lintels to relieve the monotony of white wall .
Parsing [sent. 7461 len. 55]: In regard to color and design , the interior of the Taj may rank first in the world for purely decorative workmanship ; while the perfect symmetry of its exterior , once seen can never be forgotten , nor the aerial grace of its domes , rising like marble bubbles into the clear sky .
Parsing [sent. 7462 len. 28]: The Taj represents the most highly elaborated stage of ornamentation reached by the Indo-Mohammedan builders , the stage in which the architect ends and the jeweler begins .
Parsing [sent. 7463 len. 38]: In its magnificent gateway the diagonal ornamentation at the corners , which satisfied the designers of the gateways of Itimad-ud-doulah and Sikandra mausoleums is superseded by fine marble cables , in bold twists , strong and handsome .
Parsing [sent. 7464 len. 20]: The triangular insertions of white marble and large flowers have in like manner given place to fine inlaid work .
Parsing [sent. 7465 len. 24]: Firm perpendicular lines in black marble with well proportioned panels of the same material are effectively used in the interior of the gateway .
Parsing [sent. 7466 len. 35]: On its top the Hindu brackets and monolithic architraves of Sikandra are replaced by Moorish carped arches , usually single blocks of red sandstone , in the Kiosks and pavilions which adorn the roof .
Parsing [sent. 7467 len. 36]: From the pillared pavilions a magnificent view is obtained of the Taj gardens below , with the noble Jumna river at their farther end , and the city and fort of Agra in the distance .
Parsing [sent. 7468 len. 36]: From this beautiful and splendid gateway one passes up a straight alley shaded by evergreen trees cooled by a broad shallow piece of water running along the middle of the path to the Taj itself .
Parsing [sent. 7469 len. 9]: The Taj is entirely of marble and gems .
Parsing [sent. 7470 len. 55]: The red sandstone of the other Mohammedan buildings has entirely disappeared , or rather the red sandstone which used to form the thickness of the walls , is in the Taj itself overlaid completely with white marble , and the white marble is itself inlaid with precious stones arranged in lovely patterns of flowers .
Parsing [sent. 7471 len. 29]: A feeling of purity impresses itself on the eye and the mind from the absence of the coarser material which forms so invariable a material in Agra architecture .
Parsing [sent. 7472 len. 65]: The lower wall and panels are covered with tulips , oleanders , and fullblown lilies , in flat carving on the white marble ; and although the inlaid work of flowers done in gems is very brilliant when looked at closely , there is on the whole but little color , and the all-prevailing sentiment is one of whiteness , silence , and calm .
Parsing [sent. 7473 len. 34]: The whiteness is broken only by the fine color of the inlaid gems , by lines in black marble , and by delicately written inscriptions , also in black , from the Koran .
Parsing [sent. 7474 len. 64]: Under the dome of the vast mausoleum a high and beautiful screen of open tracery in white marble rises around the two tombs , or rather cenotaphs of the emperor and his princess ; and in this marvel of marble the carving has advanced from the old geometrical patterns to a trellis-work of flowers and foliage , handled with great freedom and spirit .
Parsing [sent. 7475 len. 28]: The two cenotaphs in the center of the exquisite enclosure have no carving except the plain Kalamdan or oblong pen-box on the tomb of Emperor Shah Jehan .
Parsing [sent. 7476 len. 21]: But both cenotaphs are inlaid with flowers made of costly gems , and with the ever graceful oleander scroll . ''
Parsing [sent. 7477 len. 54]: Bayard Taylor , after describing the details of the Taj , goes on to say : `` On both sides the palm , the banyan , and the feathery bamboo mingle their foliage ; the song of birds meets your ears , and the odor of roses and lemon flowers sweetens the air .
Parsing [sent. 7478 len. 13]: Down such a vista and over such a foreground rises the Taj .
Parsing [sent. 7479 len. 14]: There is no mystery , no sense of partial failure about the Taj .
Parsing [sent. 7480 len. 36]: A thing of perfect beauty and of absolute finish in every detail , it might pass for the work of genii who knew naught of the weaknesses and ills with which mankind are beset . ''
Parsing [sent. 7481 len. 7]: All of these details are true .
Parsing [sent. 7482 len. 13]: But , taken together , they state a falsehood -- to you .
Parsing [sent. 7483 len. 8]: You can not add them up correctly .
Parsing [sent. 7484 len. 24]: Those writers know the values of their words and phrases , but to you the words and phrases convey other and uncertain values .
Parsing [sent. 7485 len. 75]: To those writers their phrases have values which I think I am now acquainted with ; and for the help of the reader I will here repeat certain of those words and phrases , and follow them with numerals which shall represent those values -- then we shall see the difference between a writer 's ciphering and a mistaken reader 's -- Precious stones , such as agate , jasper , etc. -- 5 .
Parsing [sent. 7486 len. 11]: With which every salient point is richly fretted -- 5 .
Parsing [sent. 7487 len. 11]: First in the world for purely decorative workmanship -- 9 .
Parsing [sent. 7488 len. 16]: The Taj represents the stage where the architect ends and the jeweler begins -- 5 .
Parsing [sent. 7489 len. 11]: The Taj is entirely of marble and gems -- 7 .
Parsing [sent. 7490 len. 12]: Inlaid with precious stones in lovely patterns of flowers -- 5 .
Parsing [sent. 7491 len. 31]: The inlaid work of flowers done in gems is very brilliant -LRB- followed by a most important modification which the reader is sure to read too carelessly -RRB- -- 2 .
Parsing [sent. 7492 len. 6]: The vast mausoleum -- 5 .
Parsing [sent. 7493 len. 7]: This marvel of marble -- 5 .
Parsing [sent. 7494 len. 6]: The exquisite enclosure -- 5 .
Parsing [sent. 7495 len. 10]: Inlaid with flowers made of costly gems -- 5 .
Parsing [sent. 7496 len. 11]: A thing of perfect beauty and absolute finish -- 5 .
Parsing [sent. 7497 len. 21]: Those details are correct ; the figures which I have placed after them represent quite fairly their individual , values .
Parsing [sent. 7498 len. 17]: Then why , as a whole , do they convey a false impression to the reader ?
Parsing [sent. 7499 len. 19]: It is because the reader -- beguiled by his heated imagination -- masses them in the wrong way .
Parsing [sent. 7500 len. 20]: The writer would mass the first three figures in the following way , and they would speak the truth .
Parsing [sent. 7501 len. 22]: 5 5 9 Total -- 19 But the reader masses them thus -- and then they tell a lie -- 559 .
Parsing [sent. 7502 len. 31]: The writer would add all of his twelve numerals together , and then the sum would express the whole truth about the Taj , and the truth only -- 63 .
Parsing [sent. 7503 len. 38]: But the reader -- always helped by his imagination -- would put the figures in a row one after the other , and get this sum , which would tell him a noble big lie : 559575255555 .
Parsing [sent. 7504 len. 17]: You must put in the commas yourself ; I have to go on with my work .
Parsing [sent. 7505 len. 38]: The reader will always be sure to put the figures together in that wrong way , and then as surely before him will stand , sparkling in the sun , a gem-crusted Taj tall as the Matterhorn .
Parsing [sent. 7506 len. 43]: I had to visit Niagara fifteen times before I succeeded in getting my imaginary Falls gauged to the actuality and could begin to sanely and wholesomely wonder at them for what they were , not what I had expected them to be .
Parsing [sent. 7507 len. 85]: When I first approached them it was with my face lifted toward the sky , for I thought I was going to see an Atlantic ocean pouring down thence over cloud-vexed Himalayan heights , a sea-green wall of water sixty miles front and six miles high , and so , when the toy reality came suddenly into view -- that beruffled little wet apron hanging out to dry -- the shock was too much for me , and I fell with a dull thud .
Parsing [sent. 7508 len. 51]: Yet slowly , surely , steadily , in the course of my fifteen visits , the proportions adjusted themselves to the facts , and I came at last to realize that a waterfall a hundred and sixty-five feet high and a quarter of a mile wide was an impressive thing .
Parsing [sent. 7509 len. 16]: It was not a dipperful to my vanished great vision , but it would answer .
Parsing [sent. 7510 len. 56]: I know that I ought to do with the Taj as I was obliged to do with Niagara -- see it fifteen times , and let my mind gradually get rid of the Taj built in it by its describers , by help of my imagination , and substitute for it the Taj of fact .
Parsing [sent. 7511 len. 29]: It would be noble and fine , then , and a marvel ; not the marvel which it replaced , but still a marvel , and fine enough .
Parsing [sent. 7512 len. 84]: I am a careless reader , I suppose -- an impressionist reader ; an impressionist reader of what is not an impressionist picture ; a reader who overlooks the informing details or masses their sum improperly , and gets only a large splashy , general effect -- an effect which is not correct , and which is not warranted by the particulars placed before me -- particulars which I did not examine , and whose meanings I did not cautiously and carefully estimate .
Parsing [sent. 7513 len. 87]: It is an effect which is some thirty-five or forty times finer than the reality , and is therefore a great deal better and more valuable than the reality ; and so , I ought never to hunt up the reality , but stay miles away from it , and thus preserve undamaged my own private mighty Niagara tumbling out of the vault of heaven , and my own ineffable Taj , built of tinted mists upon jeweled arches of rainbows supported by colonnades of moonlight .
Parsing [sent. 7514 len. 22]: It is a mistake for a person with an unregulated imagination to go and look at an illustrious world 's wonder .
Parsing [sent. 7515 len. 72]: I suppose that many , many years ago I gathered the idea that the Taj 's place in the achievements of man was exactly the place of the ice-storm in the achievements of Nature ; that the Taj represented man 's supremest possibility in the creation of grace and beauty and exquisiteness and splendor , just as the ice-storm represents Nature 's supremest possibility in the combination of those same qualities .
Parsing [sent. 7516 len. 47]: I do not know how long ago that idea was bred in me , but I know that I can not remember back to a time when the thought of either of these symbols of gracious and unapproachable perfection did not at once suggest the other .
Parsing [sent. 7517 len. 37]: If I thought of the ice-storm , the Taj rose before me divinely beautiful ; if I thought of the Taj , with its encrustings and inlayings of jewels , the vision of the ice-storm rose .
Parsing [sent. 7518 len. 38]: And so , to me , all these years , the Taj has had no rival among the temples and palaces of men , none that even remotely approached it -- it was man 's architectural ice-storm .
Parsing [sent. 7519 len. 43]: Here in London the other night I was talking with some Scotch and English friends , and I mentioned the ice-storm , using it as a figure -- a figure which failed , for none of them had heard of the ice-storm .
Parsing [sent. 7520 len. 22]: One gentleman , who was very familiar with American literature , said he had never seen it mentioned in any book .
Parsing [sent. 7521 len. 4]: That is strange .
Parsing [sent. 7522 len. 39]: And I , myself , was not able to say that I had seen it mentioned in a book ; and yet the autumn foliage , with all other American scenery , has received full and competent attention .
Parsing [sent. 7523 len. 14]: The oversight is strange , for in America the ice-storm is an event .
Parsing [sent. 7524 len. 12]: And it is not an event which one is careless about .
Parsing [sent. 7525 len. 29]: When it comes , the news flies from room to room in the house , there are bangings on the doors , and shoutings , `` The ice-storm !
Parsing [sent. 7526 len. 4]: the ice-storm ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7527 len. 17]: and even the laziest sleepers throw off the covers and join the rush for the windows .
Parsing [sent. 7528 len. 22]: The ice-storm occurs in midwinter , and usually its enchantments are wrought in the silence and the darkness of the night .
Parsing [sent. 7529 len. 25]: A fine drizzling rain falls hour after hour upon the naked twigs and branches of the trees , and as it falls it freezes .
Parsing [sent. 7530 len. 35]: In time the trunk and every branch and twig are incased in hard pure ice ; so that the tree looks like a skeleton tree made all of glass -- glass that is crystal-clear .
Parsing [sent. 7531 len. 20]: All along the underside of every branch and twig is a comb of little icicles -- the frozen drip .
Parsing [sent. 7532 len. 18]: Sometimes these pendants do not quite amount to icicles , but are round beads -- frozen tears .
Parsing [sent. 7533 len. 37]: The weather clears , toward dawn , and leaves a brisk pure atmosphere and a sky without a shred of cloud in it -- and everything is still , there is not a breath of wind .
Parsing [sent. 7534 len. 59]: The dawn breaks and spreads , the news of the storm goes about the house , and the little and the big , in wraps and blankets , flock to the window and press together there , and gaze intently out upon the great white ghost in the grounds , and nobody says a word , nobody stirs .
Parsing [sent. 7535 len. 19]: All are waiting ; they know what is coming , and they are waiting waiting for the miracle .
Parsing [sent. 7536 len. 45]: The minutes drift on and on and on , with not a sound but the ticking of the clock ; at last the sun fires a sudden sheaf of rays into the ghostly tree and turns it into a white splendor of glittering diamonds .
Parsing [sent. 7537 len. 33]: Everybody catches his breath , and feels a swelling in his throat and a moisture in his eyes-but waits again ; for he knows what is coming ; there is more yet .
Parsing [sent. 7538 len. 105]: The sun climbs higher , and still higher , flooding the tree from its loftiest spread of branches to its lowest , turning it to a glory of white fire ; then in a moment , without warning , comes the great miracle , the supreme miracle , the miracle without its fellow in the earth ; a gust of wind sets every branch and twig to swaying , and in an instant turns the whole white tree into a spouting and spraying explosion of flashing gems of every conceivable color ; and there it stands and sways this way and that , flash !
Parsing [sent. 7539 len. 2]: flash !
Parsing [sent. 7540 len. 2]: flash !
Parsing [sent. 7541 len. 67]: a dancing and glancing world of rubies , emeralds , diamonds , sapphires , the most radiant spectacle , the most blinding spectacle , the divinest , the most exquisite , the most intoxicating vision of fire and color and intolerable and unimaginable splendor that ever any eye has rested upon in this world , or will ever rest upon outside of the gates of heaven .
Parsing [sent. 7542 len. 47]: By all my senses , all my faculties , I know that the icestorm is Nature 's supremest achievement in the domain of the superb and the beautiful ; and by my reason , at least , I know that the Taj is man 's ice-storm .
Parsing [sent. 7543 len. 51]: In the ice-storm every one of the myriad ice-beads pendant from twig and branch is an individual gem , and changes color with every motion caused by the wind ; each tree carries a million , and a forest-front exhibits the splendors of the single tree multiplied by a thousand .
Parsing [sent. 7544 len. 29]: It occurs to me now that I have never seen the ice-storm put upon canvas , and have not heard that any painter has tried to do it .
Parsing [sent. 7545 len. 6]: I wonder why that is .
Parsing [sent. 7546 len. 15]: Is it that paint can not counterfeit the intense blaze of a sun-flooded jewel ?
Parsing [sent. 7547 len. 32]: There should be , and must be , a reason , and a good one , why the most enchanting sight that Nature has created has been neglected by the brush .
Parsing [sent. 7548 len. 15]: Often , the surest way to convey misinformation is to tell the strict truth .
Parsing [sent. 7549 len. 19]: The describers of the Taj have used the word gem in its strictest sense -- its scientific sense .
Parsing [sent. 7550 len. 34]: In that sense it is a mild word , and promises but little to the eye -- nothing bright , nothing brilliant , nothing sparkling , nothing splendid in the way of color .
Parsing [sent. 7551 len. 35]: It accurately describes the sober and unobtrusive gem-work of the Taj ; that is , to the very highly-educated one person in a thousand ; but it most falsely describes it to the 999 .
Parsing [sent. 7552 len. 83]: But the 999 are the people who ought to be especially taken care of , and to them it does not mean quiet-colored designs wrought in carnelians , or agates , or such things ; they know the word in its wide and ordinary sense only , and so to them it means diamonds and rubies and opals and their kindred , and the moment their eyes fall upon it in print they see a vision of glorious colors clothed in fire .
Parsing [sent. 7553 len. 36]: These describers are writing for the `` general , '' and so , in order to make sure of being understood , they ought to use words in their ordinary sense , or else explain .
Parsing [sent. 7554 len. 32]: The word fountain means one thing in Syria , where there is but a handful of people ; it means quite another thing in North America , where there are 75,000,000 .
Parsing [sent. 7555 len. 45]: If I were describing some Syrian scenery , and should exclaim , `` Within the narrow space of a quarter of a mile square I saw , in the glory of the flooding moonlight , two hundred noble fountains -- imagine the spectacle ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7556 len. 37]: the North American would have a vision of clustering columns of water soaring aloft , bending over in graceful arches , bursting in beaded spray and raining white fire in the moonlight-and he would be deceived .
Parsing [sent. 7557 len. 54]: But the Syrian would not be deceived ; he would merely see two hundred fresh-water springs -- two hundred drowsing puddles , as level and unpretentious and unexcited as so many door-mats , and even with the help of the moonlight he would not lose his grip in the presence of the exhibition .
Parsing [sent. 7558 len. 39]: My word `` fountain '' would be correct ; it would speak the strict truth ; and it would convey the strict truth to the handful of Syrians , and the strictest misinformation to the North American millions .
Parsing [sent. 7559 len. 61]: With their gems -- and gems -- and more gems -- and gems again -- and still other gems -- the describers of the Taj are within their legal but not their moral rights ; they are dealing in the strictest scientific truth ; and in doing it they succeed to admiration in telling `` what ai n't so . ''
Parsing [sent. 7560 len. 3]: CHAPTER LX .
Parsing [sent. 7561 len. 7]: SATAN -LRB- impatiently -RRB- to NEW-COMER .
Parsing [sent. 7562 len. 27]: The trouble with you Chicago people is , that you think you are the best people down here ; whereas you are merely the most numerous .
Parsing [sent. 7563 len. 9]: -- Pudd ` nhead Wilson 's New Calendar .
Parsing [sent. 7564 len. 25]: We wandered contentedly around here and there in India ; to Lahore , among other places , where the Lieutenant-Governor lent me an elephant .
Parsing [sent. 7565 len. 12]: This hospitality stands out in my experiences in a stately isolation .
Parsing [sent. 7566 len. 20]: It was a fine elephant , affable , gentlemanly , educated , and I was not afraid of it .
Parsing [sent. 7567 len. 36]: I even rode it with confidence through the crowded lanes of the native city , where it scared all the horses out of their senses , and where children were always just escaping its feet .
Parsing [sent. 7568 len. 30]: It took the middle of the road in a fine independent way , and left it to the world to get out of the way or take the consequences .
Parsing [sent. 7569 len. 28]: I am used to being afraid of collisions when I ride or drive , but when one is on top of an elephant that feeling is absent .
Parsing [sent. 7570 len. 13]: I could have ridden in comfort through a regiment of runaway teams .
Parsing [sent. 7571 len. 68]: I could easily learn to prefer an elephant to any other vehicle , partly because of that immunity from collisions , and partly because of the fine view one has from up there , and partly because of the dignity one feels in that high place , and partly because one can look in at the windows and see what is going on privately among the family .
Parsing [sent. 7572 len. 19]: The Lahore horses were used to elephants , but they were rapturously afraid of them just the same .
Parsing [sent. 7573 len. 4]: It seemed curious .
Parsing [sent. 7574 len. 17]: Perhaps the better they know the elephant the more they respect him in that peculiar way .
Parsing [sent. 7575 len. 18]: In our own case -- we are not afraid of dynamite till we get acquainted with it .
Parsing [sent. 7576 len. 95]: We drifted as far as Rawal Pindi , away up on the Afghan frontier -- I think it was the Afghan frontier , but it may have been Hertzegovina -- it was around there somewhere -- and down again to Delhi , to see the ancient architectural wonders there and in Old Delhi and not describe them , and also to see the scene of the illustrious assault , in the Mutiny days , when the British carried Delhi by storm , one of the marvels of history for impudent daring and immortal valor .
Parsing [sent. 7577 len. 20]: We had a refreshing rest , there in Delhi , in a great old mansion which possessed historical interest .
Parsing [sent. 7578 len. 21]: It was built by a rich Englishman who had become orientalized -- so much so that he had a zenana .
Parsing [sent. 7579 len. 11]: But he was a broadminded man , and remained so .
Parsing [sent. 7580 len. 18]: To please his harem he built a mosque ; to please himself he built an English church .
Parsing [sent. 7581 len. 10]: That kind of a man will arrive , somewhere .
Parsing [sent. 7582 len. 13]: In the Mutiny days the mansion was the British general 's headquarters .
Parsing [sent. 7583 len. 18]: It stands in a great garden -- oriental fashion -- and about it are many noble trees .
Parsing [sent. 7584 len. 23]: The trees harbor monkeys ; and they are monkeys of a watchful and enterprising sort , and not much troubled with fear .
Parsing [sent. 7585 len. 19]: They invade the house whenever they get a chance , and carry off everything they do n't want .
Parsing [sent. 7586 len. 18]: One morning the master of the house was in his bath , and the window was open .
Parsing [sent. 7587 len. 12]: Near it stood a pot of yellow paint and a brush .
Parsing [sent. 7588 len. 20]: Some monkeys appeared in the window ; to scare them away , the gentleman threw his sponge at them .
Parsing [sent. 7589 len. 61]: They did not scare at all ; they jumped into the room and threw yellow paint all over him from the brush , and drove him out ; then they painted the walls and the floor and the tank and the windows and the furniture yellow , and were in the dressing-room painting that when help arrived and routed them .
Parsing [sent. 7590 len. 57]: Two of these creatures came into my room in the early morning , through a window whose shutters I had left open , and when I woke one of them was before the glass brushing his hair , and the other one had my note-book , and was reading a page of humorous notes and crying .
Parsing [sent. 7591 len. 25]: I did not mind the one with the hair-brush , but the conduct of the other one hurt me ; it hurts me yet .
Parsing [sent. 7592 len. 25]: I threw something at him , and that was wrong , for my host had told me that the monkeys were best left alone .
Parsing [sent. 7593 len. 30]: They threw everything at me that they could lift , and then went into the bathroom to get some more things , and I shut the door on them .
Parsing [sent. 7594 len. 12]: At Jeypore , in Rajputana , we made a considerable stay .
Parsing [sent. 7595 len. 21]: We were not in the native city , but several miles from it , in the small European official suburb .
Parsing [sent. 7596 len. 24]: There were but few Europeans -- only fourteen but they were all kind and hospitable , and it amounted to being at home .
Parsing [sent. 7597 len. 39]: In Jeypore we found again what we had found all about India -- that while the Indian servant is in his way a very real treasure , he will sometimes bear watching , and the Englishman watches him .
Parsing [sent. 7598 len. 24]: If he sends him on an errand , he wants more than the man 's word for it that he did the errand .
Parsing [sent. 7599 len. 31]: When fruit and vegetables were sent to us , a `` chit '' came with them -- a receipt for us to sign ; otherwise the things might not arrive .
Parsing [sent. 7600 len. 61]: If a gentleman sent up his carriage , the chit stated `` from '' such-and-such an hour `` to '' such-and-such an hour -- which made it unhandy for the coachman and his two or three subordinates to put us off with a part of the allotted time and devote the rest of it to a lark of their own .
Parsing [sent. 7601 len. 30]: We were pleasantly situated in a small two-storied inn , in an empty large compound which was surrounded by a mud wall as high as a man 's head .
Parsing [sent. 7602 len. 12]: The inn was kept by nine Hindoo brothers , its owners .
Parsing [sent. 7603 len. 63]: They lived , with their families , in a one-storied building within the compound , but off to one side , and there was always a long pile of their little comely brown children loosely stacked in its veranda , and a detachment of the parents wedged among them , smoking the hookah or the howdah , or whatever they call it .
Parsing [sent. 7604 len. 36]: By the veranda stood a palm , and a monkey lived in it , and led a lonesome life , and always looked sad and weary , and the crows bothered him a good deal .
Parsing [sent. 7605 len. 67]: The inn cow poked about the compound and emphasized the secluded and country air of the place , and there was a dog of no particular breed , who was always present in the compound , and always asleep , always stretched out baking in the sun and adding to the deep tranquility and reposefulness of the place , when the crows were away on business .
Parsing [sent. 7606 len. 26]: White-draperied servants were coming and going all the time , but they seemed only spirits , for their feet were bare and made no sound .
Parsing [sent. 7607 len. 42]: Down the lane a piece lived an elephant in the shade of a noble tree , and rocked and rocked , and reached about with his trunk , begging of his brown mistress or fumbling the children playing at his feet .
Parsing [sent. 7608 len. 25]: And there were camels about , but they go on velvet feet , and were proper to the silence and serenity of the surroundings .
Parsing [sent. 7609 len. 19]: The Satan mentioned at the head of this chapter was not our Satan , but the other one .
Parsing [sent. 7610 len. 7]: Our Satan was lost to us .
Parsing [sent. 7611 len. 19]: In these later days he had passed out of our life -- lamented by me , and sincerely .
Parsing [sent. 7612 len. 16]: I was missing him ; I am missing him yet , after all these months .
Parsing [sent. 7613 len. 12]: He was an astonishing creature to fly around and do things .
Parsing [sent. 7614 len. 19]: He did n't always do them quite right , but he did them , and did them suddenly .
Parsing [sent. 7615 len. 6]: There was no time wasted .
Parsing [sent. 7616 len. 14]: You would say : `` Pack the trunks and bags , Satan . ''
Parsing [sent. 7617 len. 9]: `` Wair good '' -LRB- very good -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 7618 len. 50]: Then there would be a brief sound of thrashing and slashing and humming and buzzing , and a spectacle as of a whirlwind spinning gowns and jackets and coats and boots and things through the air , and then with bow and touch -- `` Awready , master . ''
Parsing [sent. 7619 len. 4]: It was wonderful .
Parsing [sent. 7620 len. 5]: It made one dizzy .
Parsing [sent. 7621 len. 34]: He crumpled dresses a good deal , and he had no particular plan about the work -- at first -- except to put each article into the trunk it did n't belong in .
Parsing [sent. 7622 len. 9]: But he soon reformed , in this matter .
Parsing [sent. 7623 len. 35]: Not entirely ; for , to the last , he would cram into the satchel sacred to literature any odds and ends of rubbish that he could n't find a handy place for elsewhere .
Parsing [sent. 7624 len. 36]: When threatened with death for this , it did not trouble him ; he only looked pleasant , saluted with soldierly grace , said `` Wair good , '' and did it again next day .
Parsing [sent. 7625 len. 66]: He was always busy ; kept the rooms tidied up , the boots polished , the clothes brushed , the wash-basin full of clean water , my dress clothes laid out and ready for the lecture-hall an hour ahead of time ; and he dressed me from head to heel in spite of my determination to do it myself , according to my lifelong custom .
Parsing [sent. 7626 len. 25]: He was a born boss , and loved to command , and to jaw and dispute with inferiors and harry them and bullyrag them .
Parsing [sent. 7627 len. 17]: He was fine at the railway station -- yes , he was at his finest there .
Parsing [sent. 7628 len. 102]: He would shoulder and plunge and paw his violent way through the packed multitude of natives with nineteen coolies at his tail , each bearing a trifle of luggage -- one a trunk , another a parasol , another a shawl , another a fan , and so on ; one article to each , and the longer the procession , the better he was suited -- and he was sure to make for some engaged sleeper and begin to hurl the owner 's things out of it , swearing that it was ours and that there had been a mistake .
Parsing [sent. 7629 len. 62]: Arrived at our own sleeper , he would undo the bedding-bundles and make the beds and put everything to rights and shipshape in two minutes ; then put his head out at a window and have a restful good time abusing his gang of coolies and disputing their bill until we arrived and made him pay them and stop his noise .
Parsing [sent. 7630 len. 25]: Speaking of noise , he certainly was the noisest little devil in India -- and that is saying much , very much , indeed .
Parsing [sent. 7631 len. 15]: I loved him for his noise , but the family detested him for it .
Parsing [sent. 7632 len. 14]: They could not abide it ; they could not get reconciled to it .
Parsing [sent. 7633 len. 4]: It humiliated them .
Parsing [sent. 7634 len. 59]: As a rule , when we got within six hundred yards of one of those big railway stations , a mighty racket of screaming and shrieking and shouting and storming would break upon us , and I would be happy to myself , and the family would say , with shame : `` There -- that 's Satan .
Parsing [sent. 7635 len. 7]: Why do you keep him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7636 len. 57]: And , sure enough , there in the whirling midst of fifteen hundred wondering people we would find that little scrap of a creature gesticulating like a spider with the colic , his black eyes snapping , his fez-tassel dancing , his jaws pouring out floods of billingsgate upon his gang of beseeching and astonished coolies .
Parsing [sent. 7637 len. 25]: I loved him ; I could n't help it ; but the family -- why , they could hardly speak of him with patience .
Parsing [sent. 7638 len. 24]: To this day I regret his loss , and wish I had him back ; but they -- it is different with them .
Parsing [sent. 7639 len. 10]: He was a native , and came from Surat .
Parsing [sent. 7640 len. 23]: Twenty degrees of latitude lay between his birthplace and Manuel 's , and fifteen hundred between their ways and characters and dispositions .
Parsing [sent. 7641 len. 10]: I only liked Manuel , but I loved Satan .
Parsing [sent. 7642 len. 9]: This latter 's real name was intensely Indian .
Parsing [sent. 7643 len. 21]: I could not quite get the hang of it , but it sounded like Bunder Rao Ram Chunder Clam Chowder .
Parsing [sent. 7644 len. 15]: It was too long for handy use , anyway ; so I reduced it .
Parsing [sent. 7645 len. 26]: When he had been with us two or three weeks , he began to make mistakes which I had difficulty in patching up for him .
Parsing [sent. 7646 len. 39]: Approaching Benares one day , he got out of the train to see if he could get up a misunderstanding with somebody , for it had been a weary , long journey and he wanted to freshen up .
Parsing [sent. 7647 len. 20]: He found what he was after , but kept up his pow-wow a shade too long and got left .
Parsing [sent. 7648 len. 12]: So there we were in a strange city and no chambermaid .
Parsing [sent. 7649 len. 18]: It was awkward for us , and we told him he must not do so any more .
Parsing [sent. 7650 len. 16]: He saluted and said in his dear , pleasant way , `` Wair good . ''
Parsing [sent. 7651 len. 7]: Then at Lucknow he got drunk .
Parsing [sent. 7652 len. 35]: I said it was a fever , and got the family 's compassion , and solicitude aroused ; so they gave him a teaspoonful of liquid quinine and it set his vitals on fire .
Parsing [sent. 7653 len. 27]: He made several grimaces which gave me a better idea of the Lisbon earthquake than any I have ever got of it from paintings and descriptions .
Parsing [sent. 7654 len. 81]: His drunk was still portentously solid next morning , but I could have pulled him through with the family if he would only have taken another spoonful of that remedy ; but no , although he was stupefied , his memory still had flickerings of life ; so he smiled a divinely dull smile and said , fumblingly saluting : `` Scoose me , mem Saheb , scoose me , Missy Saheb ; Satan not prefer it , please . ''
Parsing [sent. 7655 len. 11]: Then some instinct revealed to them that he was drunk .
Parsing [sent. 7656 len. 14]: They gave him prompt notice that next time this happened he must go .
Parsing [sent. 7657 len. 17]: He got out a maudlin and most gentle `` Wair good , '' and saluted indefinitely .
Parsing [sent. 7658 len. 9]: Only one short week later he fell again .
Parsing [sent. 7659 len. 5]: And oh , sorrow !
Parsing [sent. 7660 len. 16]: not in a hotel this time , but in an English gentleman 's private house .
Parsing [sent. 7661 len. 8]: And in Agra , of all places .
Parsing [sent. 7662 len. 6]: So he had to go .
Parsing [sent. 7663 len. 31]: When I told him , he said patiently , `` Wair good , '' and made his parting salute , and went out from us to return no more forever .
Parsing [sent. 7664 len. 3]: Dear me !
Parsing [sent. 7665 len. 15]: I would rather have lost a hundred angels than that one poor lovely devil .
Parsing [sent. 7666 len. 56]: What style he used to put on , in a swell hotel or in a private house -- snow-white muslin from his chin to his bare feet , a crimson sash embroidered with gold thread around his waist , and on his head a great sea-green turban like to the turban of the Grand Turk .
Parsing [sent. 7667 len. 16]: He was not a liar ; but he will become one if he keeps on .
Parsing [sent. 7668 len. 50]: He told me once that he used to crack cocoanuts with his teeth when he was a boy ; and when I asked how he got them into his mouth , he said he was upward of six feet high at that time , and had an unusual mouth .
Parsing [sent. 7669 len. 36]: And when I followed him up and asked him what had become of that other foot , he said a house fell on him and he was never able to get his stature back again .
Parsing [sent. 7670 len. 24]: Swervings like these from the strict line of fact often beguile a truthful man on and on until he eventually becomes a liar .
Parsing [sent. 7671 len. 19]: His successor was a Mohammedan , Sahadat Mohammed Khan ; very dark , very tall , very grave .
Parsing [sent. 7672 len. 22]: He went always in flowing masses of white , from the top of his big turban down to his bare feet .
Parsing [sent. 7673 len. 5]: His voice was low .
Parsing [sent. 7674 len. 14]: He glided about in a noiseless way , and looked like a ghost .
Parsing [sent. 7675 len. 6]: He was competent and satisfactory .
Parsing [sent. 7676 len. 10]: But where he was , it seemed always Sunday .
Parsing [sent. 7677 len. 9]: It was not so in Satan 's time .
Parsing [sent. 7678 len. 103]: Jeypore is intensely Indian , but it has two or three features which indicate the presence of European science and European interest in the weal of the common public , such as the liberal water-supply furnished by great works built at the State 's expense ; good sanitation , resulting in a degree of healthfulness unusually high for India ; a noble pleasure garden , with privileged days for women ; schools for the instruction of native youth in advanced art , both ornamental and utilitarian ; and a new and beautiful palace stocked with a museum of extraordinary interest and value .
Parsing [sent. 7679 len. 36]: Without the Maharaja 's sympathy and purse these beneficences could not have been created ; but he is a man of wide views and large generosities , and all such matters find hospitality with him .
Parsing [sent. 7680 len. 86]: We drove often to the city from the hotel Kaiser-i-Hind , a journey which was always full of interest , both night and day , for that country road was never quiet , never empty , but was always India in motion , always a streaming flood of brown people clothed in smouchings from the rainbow , a tossing and moiling flood , happy , noisy , a charming and satisfying confusion of strange human and strange animal life and equally strange and outlandish vehicles .
Parsing [sent. 7681 len. 8]: And the city itself is a curiosity .
Parsing [sent. 7682 len. 18]: Any Indian city is that , but this one is not like any other that we saw .
Parsing [sent. 7683 len. 101]: It is shut up in a lofty turreted wall ; the main body of it is divided into six parts by perfectly straight streets that are more than a hundred feet wide ; the blocks of houses exhibit a long frontage of the most taking architectural quaintnesses , the straight lines being broken everywhere by pretty little balconies , pillared and highly ornamented , and other cunning and cozy and inviting perches and projections , and many of the fronts are curiously pictured by the brush , and the whole of them have the soft rich tint of strawberry ice-cream .
Parsing [sent. 7684 len. 56]: One can not look down the far stretch of the chief street and persuade himself that these are real houses , and that it is all out of doors -- the impression that it is an unreality , a picture , a scene in a theater , is the only one that will take hold .
Parsing [sent. 7685 len. 15]: Then there came a great day when this illusion was more pronounced than ever .
Parsing [sent. 7686 len. 55]: A rich Hindoo had been spending a fortune upon the manufacture of a crowd of idols and accompanying paraphernalia whose purpose was to illustrate scenes in the life of his especial god or saint , and this fine show was to be brought through the town in processional state at ten in the morning .
Parsing [sent. 7687 len. 22]: As we passed through the great public pleasure garden on our way to the city we found it crowded with natives .
Parsing [sent. 7688 len. 5]: That was one sight .
Parsing [sent. 7689 len. 5]: Then there was another .
Parsing [sent. 7690 len. 38]: In the midst of the spacious lawns stands the palace which contains the museum -- a beautiful construction of stone which shows arched colonnades , one above another , and receding , terrace-fashion , toward the sky .
Parsing [sent. 7691 len. 21]: Every one of these terraces , all the way to the top one , was packed and jammed with natives .
Parsing [sent. 7692 len. 39]: One must try to imagine those solid masses of splendid color , one above another , up and up , against the blue sky , and the Indian sun turning them all to beds of fire and flame .
Parsing [sent. 7693 len. 65]: Later , when we reached the city , and glanced down the chief avenue , smouldering in its crushed-strawberry tint , those splendid effects were repeated ; for every balcony , and every fanciful bird-cage of a snuggery countersunk in the house-fronts , and all the long lines of roofs were crowded with people , and each crowd was an explosion of brilliant color .
Parsing [sent. 7694 len. 132]: Then the wide street itself , away down and down and down into the distance , was alive with gorgeously-clothed people not still , but moving , swaying , drifting , eddying , a delirious display of all colors and all shades of color , delicate , lovely , pale , soft , strong , stunning , vivid , brilliant , a sort of storm of sweetpea blossoms passing on the wings of a hurricane ; and presently , through this storm of color , came swaying and swinging the majestic elephants , clothed in their Sunday best of gaudinesses , and the long procession of fanciful trucks freighted with their groups of curious and costly images , and then the long rearguard of stately camels , with their picturesque riders .
Parsing [sent. 7695 len. 45]: For color , and picturesqueness , and novelty , and outlandishness , and sustained interest and fascination , it was the most satisfying show I had ever seen , and I suppose I shall not have the privilege of looking upon its like again .
Parsing [sent. 7696 len. 3]: CHAPTER LXI .
Parsing [sent. 7697 len. 8]: In the first place God made idiots .
Parsing [sent. 7698 len. 5]: This was for practice .
Parsing [sent. 7699 len. 6]: Then He made School Boards .
Parsing [sent. 7700 len. 9]: -- Pudd ` nhead Wilson 's New Calendar .
Parsing [sent. 7701 len. 39]: Suppose we applied no more ingenuity to the instruction of deaf and dumb and blind children than we sometimes apply in our American public schools to the instruction of children who are in possession of all their faculties ?
Parsing [sent. 7702 len. 15]: The result would be that the deaf and dumb and blind would acquire nothing .
Parsing [sent. 7703 len. 12]: They would live and die as ignorant as bricks and stones .
Parsing [sent. 7704 len. 9]: The methods used in the asylums are rational .
Parsing [sent. 7705 len. 69]: The teacher exactly measures the child 's capacity , to begin with ; and from thence onwards the tasks imposed are nicely gauged to the gradual development of that capacity , the tasks keep pace with the steps of the child 's progress , they do n't jump miles and leagues ahead of it by irrational caprice and land in vacancy -- according to the average public-school plan .
Parsing [sent. 7706 len. 65]: In the public school , apparently , they teach the child to spell cat , then ask it to calculate an eclipse ; when it can read words of two syllables , they require it to explain the circulation of the blood ; when it reaches the head of the infant class they bully it with conundrums that cover the domain of universal knowledge .
Parsing [sent. 7707 len. 17]: This sounds extravagant -- and is ; yet it goes no great way beyond the facts .
Parsing [sent. 7708 len. 19]: I received a curious letter one day , from the Punjab -LRB- you must pronounce it Punjawb -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 7709 len. 19]: The handwriting was excellent , and the wording was English -- English , and yet not exactly English .
Parsing [sent. 7710 len. 26]: The style was easy and smooth and flowing , yet there was something subtly foreign about it -- something tropically ornate and sentimental and rhetorical .
Parsing [sent. 7711 len. 24]: It turned out to be the work of a Hindoo youth , the holder of a humble clerical billet in a railway office .
Parsing [sent. 7712 len. 13]: He had been educated in one of the numerous colleges of India .
Parsing [sent. 7713 len. 17]: Upon inquiry I was told that the country was full of young fellows of his like .
Parsing [sent. 7714 len. 32]: They had been educated away up to the snow-summits of learning -- and the market for all this elaborate cultivation was minutely out of proportion to the vastness of the product .
Parsing [sent. 7715 len. 23]: This market consisted of some thousands of small clerical posts under the government -- the supply of material for it was multitudinous .
Parsing [sent. 7716 len. 68]: If this youth with the flowing style and the blossoming English was occupying a small railway clerkship , it meant that there were hundreds and hundreds as capable as he , or he would be in a high place ; and it certainly meant that there were thousands whose education and capacity had fallen a little short , and that they would have to go without places .
Parsing [sent. 7717 len. 43]: Apparently , then , the colleges of India were doing what our high schools have long been doing -- richly over-supplying the market for highly-educated service ; and thereby doing a damage to the scholar , and through him to the country .
Parsing [sent. 7718 len. 49]: At home I once made a speech deploring the injuries inflicted by the high school in making handicrafts distasteful to boys who would have been willing to make a living at trades and agriculture if they had but had the good luck to stop with the common school .
Parsing [sent. 7719 len. 6]: But I made no converts .
Parsing [sent. 7720 len. 29]: Not one , in a community overrun with educated idlers who were above following their fathers ' mechanical trades , yet could find no market for their book-knowledge .
Parsing [sent. 7721 len. 47]: The same mail that brought me the letter from the Punjab , brought also a little book published by Messrs. Thacker , Spink & Co. , of Calcutta , which interested me , for both its preface and its contents treated of this matter of over-education .
Parsing [sent. 7722 len. 11]: In the preface occurs this paragraph from the Calcutta Review .
Parsing [sent. 7723 len. 47]: For `` Government office '' read `` drygoods clerkship '' and it will fit more than one region of America : `` The education that we give makes the boys a little less clownish in their manners , and more intelligent when spoken to by strangers .
Parsing [sent. 7724 len. 26]: On the other hand , it has made them less contented with their lot in life , and less willing to work with their hands .
Parsing [sent. 7725 len. 47]: The form which discontent takes in this country is not of a healthy kind ; for , the Natives of India consider that the only occupation worthy of an educated man is that of a writership in some office , and especially in a Government office .
Parsing [sent. 7726 len. 29]: The village schoolboy goes back to the plow with the greatest reluctance ; and the town schoolboy carries the same discontent and inefficiency into his father 's workshop .
Parsing [sent. 7727 len. 33]: Sometimes these ex-students positively refuse at first to work ; and more than once parents have openly expressed their regret that they ever allowed their sons to be inveigled to school . ''
Parsing [sent. 7728 len. 36]: The little book which I am quoting from is called `` Indo-Anglian Literature , '' and is well stocked with `` baboo '' English -- clerkly English , booky English , acquired in the schools .
Parsing [sent. 7729 len. 42]: Some of it is very funny , -- almost as funny , perhaps , as what you and I produce when we try to write in a language not our own ; but much of it is surprisingly correct and free .
Parsing [sent. 7730 len. 14]: If I were going to quote good English -- but I am not .
Parsing [sent. 7731 len. 20]: India is well stocked with natives who speak it and write it as well as the best of us .
Parsing [sent. 7732 len. 18]: I merely wish to show some of the quaint imperfect attempts at the use of our tongue .
Parsing [sent. 7733 len. 80]: There are many letters in the book ; poverty imploring help -- bread , money , kindness , office -- generally an office , a clerkship , some way to get food and a rag out of the applicant 's unmarketable education ; and food not for himself alone , but sometimes for a dozen helpless relations in addition to his own family ; for those people are astonishingly unselfish , and admirably faithful to their ties of kinship .
Parsing [sent. 7734 len. 10]: Among us I think there is nothing approaching it .
Parsing [sent. 7735 len. 55]: Strange as some of these wailing and supplicating letters are , humble and even groveling as some of them are , and quaintly funny and confused as a goodly number of them are , there is still a pathos about them , as a rule , that checks the rising laugh and reproaches it .
Parsing [sent. 7736 len. 14]: In the following letter `` father '' is not to be read literally .
Parsing [sent. 7737 len. 20]: In Ceylon a little native beggar-girl embarrassed me by calling me father , although I knew she was mistaken .
Parsing [sent. 7738 len. 23]: I was so new that I did not know that she was merely following the custom of the dependent and the supplicant .
Parsing [sent. 7739 len. 80]: `` SIR , `` I pray please to give me some action -LRB- work -RRB- for I am very poor boy I have no one to help me even so father for it so it seemed in thy good sight , you give the Telegraph Office , and another work what is your wish I am very poor boy , this understand what is your wish you my father I am your son this understand what is your wish .
Parsing [sent. 7740 len. 53]: `` Your Sirvent , P. C. B. '' Through ages of debasing oppression suffered by these people at the hands of their native rulers , they come legitimately by the attitude and language of fawning and flattery , and one must remember this in mitigation when passing judgment upon the native character .
Parsing [sent. 7741 len. 47]: It is common in these letters to find the petitioner furtively trying to get at the white man 's soft religious side ; even this poor boy baits his hook with a macerated Bible-text in the hope that it may catch something if all else fail .
Parsing [sent. 7742 len. 59]: Here is an application for the post of instructor in English to some children : `` My Dear Sir or Gentleman , that your Petitioner has much qualification in the Language of English to instruct the young boys ; I was given to understand that your of suitable children has to acquire the knowledge of English language . ''
Parsing [sent. 7743 len. 59]: As a sample of the flowery Eastern style , I will take a sentence or two from a long letter written by a young native to the Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal -- an application for employment : `` HONORED AND MUCH RESPECTED SIR , `` I hope your honor will condescend to hear the tale of this poor creature .
Parsing [sent. 7744 len. 13]: I shall overflow with gratitude at this mark of your royal condescension .
Parsing [sent. 7745 len. 59]: The bird-like happiness has flown away from my nest-like heart and has not hitherto returned from the period whence the rose of my father 's life suffered the autumnal breath of death , in plain English he passed through the gates of Grave , and from that hour the phantom of delight has never danced before me . ''
Parsing [sent. 7746 len. 20]: It is all school-English , book-English , you see ; and good enough , too , all things considered .
Parsing [sent. 7747 len. 20]: If the native boy had but that one study he would shine , he would dazzle , no doubt .
Parsing [sent. 7748 len. 7]: But that is not the case .
Parsing [sent. 7749 len. 51]: He is situated as are our public-school children -- loaded down with an over-freightage of other studies ; and frequently they are as far beyond the actual point of progress reached by him and suited to the stage of development attained , as could be imagined by the insanest fancy .
Parsing [sent. 7750 len. 25]: Apparently -- like our public-school boy -- he must work , work , work , in school and out , and play but little .
Parsing [sent. 7751 len. 33]: Apparently -- like our public-school boy -- his `` education '' consists in learning things , not the meaning of them ; he is fed upon the husks , not the corn .
Parsing [sent. 7752 len. 34]: From several essays written by native schoolboys in answer to the question of how they spend their day , I select one -- the one which goes most into detail : `` 66 .
Parsing [sent. 7753 len. 107]: At the break of day I rises from my own bed and finish my daily duty , then I employ myself till 8 o'clock , after which I employ myself to bathe , then take for my body some sweet meat , and just at 9 1/2 I came to school to attend my class duty , then at 2 1/2 P. M. I return from school and engage myself to do my natural duty , then , I engage for a quarter to take my tiffin , then I study till 5 P. M. , after which I began to play anything which comes in my head .
Parsing [sent. 7754 len. 40]: After 8 1/2 , half pass to eight we are began to sleep , before sleeping I told a constable just 11 o ' he came and rose us from half pass eleven we began to read still morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 7755 len. 15]: It is not perfectly clear , now that I come to cipher upon it .
Parsing [sent. 7756 len. 51]: He gets up at about 5 in the morning , or along there somewhere , and goes to bed about fifteen or sixteen hours afterward -- that much of it seems straight ; but why he should rise again three hours later and resume his studies till morning is puzzling .
Parsing [sent. 7757 len. 10]: I think it is because he is studying history .
Parsing [sent. 7758 len. 71]: History requires a world of time and bitter hard work when your `` education '' is no further advanced than the cat 's ; when you are merely stuffing yourself with a mixed-up mess of empty names and random incidents and elusive dates , which no one teaches you how to interpret , and which , uninterpreted , pay you not a farthing 's value for your waste of time .
Parsing [sent. 7759 len. 28]: Yes , I think he had to get up at halfpast 11 P.M. in order to be sure to be perfect with his history lesson by noon .
Parsing [sent. 7760 len. 18]: With results as follows -- from a Calcutta school examination : `` Q. Who was Cardinal Wolsey ?
Parsing [sent. 7761 len. 13]: `` Cardinal Wolsey was an Editor of a paper named North Briton .
Parsing [sent. 7762 len. 17]: No. 45 of his publication he charged the King of uttering a lie from the throne .
Parsing [sent. 7763 len. 15]: He was arrested and cast into prison ; and after releasing went to France .
Parsing [sent. 7764 len. 3]: `` 3 .
Parsing [sent. 7765 len. 18]: As Bishop of York but died in disentry in a church on his way to be blockheaded .
Parsing [sent. 7766 len. 3]: `` 8 .
Parsing [sent. 7767 len. 88]: Cardinal Wolsey was the son of Edward IV , after his father 's death he himself ascended the throne at the age of -LRB- 10 -RRB- ten only , but when he surpassed or when he was fallen in his twenty years of age at that time he wished to make a journey in his countries under him , but he was opposed by his mother to do journey , and according to his mother 's example he remained in the home , and then became King .
Parsing [sent. 7768 len. 16]: After many times obstacles and many confusion he become King and afterwards his brother . ''
Parsing [sent. 7769 len. 11]: There is probably not a word of truth in that .
Parsing [sent. 7770 len. 3]: `` Q .
Parsing [sent. 7771 len. 10]: What is the meaning of ` Ich Dien ' ?
Parsing [sent. 7772 len. 3]: `` 10 .
Parsing [sent. 7773 len. 13]: An honor conferred on the first or eldest sons of English Sovereigns .
Parsing [sent. 7774 len. 8]: It is nothing more than some feathers .
Parsing [sent. 7775 len. 3]: `` 11 .
Parsing [sent. 7776 len. 29]: Ich Dien was the word which was written on the feathers of the blind King who came to fight , being interlaced with the bridles of the horse .
Parsing [sent. 7777 len. 3]: `` 13 .
Parsing [sent. 7778 len. 39]: Ich Dien is a title given to Henry VII by the Pope of Rome , when he forwarded the Reformation of Cardinal Wolsy to Rome , and for this reason he was called Commander of the faith . ''
Parsing [sent. 7779 len. 19]: A dozen or so of this kind of insane answers are quoted in the book from that examination .
Parsing [sent. 7780 len. 83]: Each answer is sweeping proof , all by itself , that the person uttering it was pushed ahead of where he belonged when he was put into history ; proof that he had been put to the task of acquiring history before he had had a single lesson in the art of acquiring it , which is the equivalent of dumping a pupil into geometry before he has learned the progressive steps which lead up to it and make its acquirement possible .
Parsing [sent. 7781 len. 9]: Those Calcutta novices had no business with history .
Parsing [sent. 7782 len. 19]: There was no excuse for examining them in it , no excuse for exposing them and their teachers .
Parsing [sent. 7783 len. 13]: They were totally empty ; there was nothing to `` examine . ''
Parsing [sent. 7784 len. 75]: Helen Keller has been dumb , stone deaf , and stone blind , ever since she was a little baby a year-and-a-half old ; and now at sixteen years of age this miraculous creature , this wonder of all the ages , passes the Harvard University examination in Latin , German , French history , belles lettres , and such things , and does it brilliantly , too , not in a commonplace fashion .
Parsing [sent. 7785 len. 17]: She does n't know merely things , she is splendidly familiar with the meanings of them .
Parsing [sent. 7786 len. 38]: When she writes an essay on a Shakespearean character , her English is fine and strong , her grasp of the subject is the grasp of one who knows , and her page is electric with light .
Parsing [sent. 7787 len. 16]: Has Miss Sullivan taught her by the methods of India and the American public school ?
Parsing [sent. 7788 len. 21]: No , oh , no ; for then she would be deafer and dumber and blinder than she was before .
Parsing [sent. 7789 len. 16]: It is a pity that we ca n't educate all the children in the asylums .
Parsing [sent. 7790 len. 16]: To continue the Calcutta exposure : `` What is the meaning of a Sheriff ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7791 len. 3]: `` 25 .
Parsing [sent. 7792 len. 11]: Sheriff is a post opened in the time of John .
Parsing [sent. 7793 len. 33]: The duty of Sheriff here in Calcutta , to look out and catch those carriages which is rashly driven out by the coachman ; but it is a high post in England .
Parsing [sent. 7794 len. 3]: `` 26 .
Parsing [sent. 7795 len. 9]: Sheriff was the English bill of common prayer .
Parsing [sent. 7796 len. 3]: `` 27 .
Parsing [sent. 7797 len. 13]: The man with whom the accusative persons are placed is called Sheriff .
Parsing [sent. 7798 len. 3]: `` 28 .
Parsing [sent. 7799 len. 44]: Sheriff -- Latin term for ` shrub , ' we called broom , worn by the first earl of Enjue , as an emblem of humility when they went to the pilgrimage , and from this their hairs took their crest and surname .
Parsing [sent. 7800 len. 3]: `` 29 .
Parsing [sent. 7801 len. 17]: Sheriff is a kind of titlous sect of people , as Barons , Nobles , etc. .
Parsing [sent. 7802 len. 3]: `` 30 .
Parsing [sent. 7803 len. 17]: Sheriff ; a tittle given on those persons who were respective and pious in England . ''
Parsing [sent. 7804 len. 42]: The students were examined in the following bulky matters : Geometry , the Solar Spectrum , the Habeas Corpus Act , the British Parliament , and in Metaphysics they were asked to trace the progress of skepticism from Descartes to Hume .
Parsing [sent. 7805 len. 14]: It is within bounds to say that some of the results were astonishing .
Parsing [sent. 7806 len. 52]: Without doubt , there were students present who justified their teacher 's wisdom in introducing them to these studies ; but the fact is also evident that others had been pushed into these studies to waste their time over them when they could have been profitably employed in hunting smaller game .
Parsing [sent. 7807 len. 16]: Under the head of Geometry , one of the answers is this : `` 49 .
Parsing [sent. 7808 len. 12]: The whole BD = the whole CA , and so-so-so-so-so-so-so . ''
Parsing [sent. 7809 len. 15]: To me this is cloudy , but I was never well up in geometry .
Parsing [sent. 7810 len. 27]: That was the only effort made among the five students who appeared for examination in geometry ; the other four wailed and surrendered without a fight .
Parsing [sent. 7811 len. 50]: They are piteous wails , too , wails of despair ; and one of them is an eloquent reproach ; it comes from a poor fellow who has been laden beyond his strength by a stupid teacher , and is eloquent in spite of the poverty of its English .
Parsing [sent. 7812 len. 23]: The poor chap finds himself required to explain riddles which even Sir Isaac Newton was not able to understand : `` 50 .
Parsing [sent. 7813 len. 21]: Oh my dear father examiner you my father and you kindly give a number of pass you my great father .
Parsing [sent. 7814 len. 3]: `` 51 .
Parsing [sent. 7815 len. 25]: I am a poor boy and have no means to support my mother and two brothers who are suffering much for want of food .
Parsing [sent. 7816 len. 30]: I get four rupees monthly from charity fund of this place , from which I send two rupees for their support , and keep two for my own support .
Parsing [sent. 7817 len. 30]: Father , if I relate the unlucky circumstance under which we are placed , then , I think , you will not be able to suppress the tender tear .
Parsing [sent. 7818 len. 3]: `` 52 .
Parsing [sent. 7819 len. 28]: Sir which Sir Isaac Newton and other experienced mathematicians can not understand I being third of Entrance Class can understand these which is too impossible to imagine .
Parsing [sent. 7820 len. 16]: And my examiner also has put very tiresome and very heavy propositions to prove . ''
Parsing [sent. 7821 len. 24]: We must remember that these pupils had to do their thinking in one language , and express themselves in another and alien one .
Parsing [sent. 7822 len. 6]: It was a heavy handicap .
Parsing [sent. 7823 len. 36]: I have by me `` English as She is Taught '' -- a collection of American examinations made in the public schools of Brooklyn by one of the teachers , Miss Caroline B. Le Row .
Parsing [sent. 7824 len. 42]: An extract or two from its pages will show that when the American pupil is using but one language , and that one his own , his performance is no whit better than his Indian brother 's : `` ON HISTORY .
Parsing [sent. 7825 len. 11]: `` Christopher Columbus was called the father of his Country .
Parsing [sent. 7826 len. 19]: Queen Isabella of Spain sold her watch and chain and other millinery so that Columbus could discover America .
Parsing [sent. 7827 len. 11]: `` The Indian wars were very desecrating to the country .
Parsing [sent. 7828 len. 16]: `` The Indians pursued their warfare by hiding in the bushes and then scalping them .
Parsing [sent. 7829 len. 13]: `` Captain John Smith has been styled the father of his country .
Parsing [sent. 7830 len. 9]: His life was saved by his daughter Pochahantas .
Parsing [sent. 7831 len. 13]: `` The Puritans found an insane asylum in the wilds of America .
Parsing [sent. 7832 len. 19]: `` The Stamp Act was to make everybody stamp all materials so they should be null and void .
Parsing [sent. 7833 len. 8]: `` Washington died in Spain almost broken-hearted .
Parsing [sent. 7834 len. 10]: His remains were taken to the cathedral in Havana .
Parsing [sent. 7835 len. 11]: `` Gorilla warfare was where men rode on gorillas . ''
Parsing [sent. 7836 len. 61]: In Brooklyn , as in India , they examine a pupil , and when they find out he does n't know anything , they put him into literature , or geometry , or astronomy , or government , or something like that , so that he can properly display the assification of the whole system -- `` ON LITERATURE . ''
Parsing [sent. 7837 len. 10]: ` Bracebridge Hall ' was written by Henry Irving .
Parsing [sent. 7838 len. 10]: `` Edgar A. Poe was a very curdling writer .
Parsing [sent. 7839 len. 6]: `` Beowulf wrote the Scriptures .
Parsing [sent. 7840 len. 9]: `` Ben Johnson survived Shakespeare in some respects .
Parsing [sent. 7841 len. 23]: `` In the ` Canterbury Tale ' it gives account of King Alfred on his way to the shrine of Thomas Bucket .
Parsing [sent. 7842 len. 9]: `` Chaucer was the father of English pottery .
Parsing [sent. 7843 len. 8]: `` Chaucer was succeeded by H. Wads .
Parsing [sent. 7844 len. 3]: Longfellow . ''
Parsing [sent. 7845 len. 22]: We will finish with a couple of samples of `` literature , '' one from America , the other from India .
Parsing [sent. 7846 len. 25]: The first is a Brooklyn public-school boy 's attempt to turn a few verses of the `` Lady of the Lake '' into prose .
Parsing [sent. 7847 len. 79]: You will have to concede that he did it : `` The man who rode on the horse performed the whip and an instrument made of steel alone with strong ardor not diminishing , for , being tired from the time passed with hard labor overworked with anger and ignorant with weariness , while every breath for labor he drew with cries full of sorrow , the young deer made imperfect who worked hard filtered in sight . ''
Parsing [sent. 7848 len. 42]: The following paragraph is from a little book which is famous in India -- the biography of a distinguished Hindoo judge , Onoocool Chunder Mookerjee ; it was written by his nephew , and is unintentionally funny-in fact , exceedingly so .
Parsing [sent. 7849 len. 7]: I offer here the closing scene .
Parsing [sent. 7850 len. 47]: If you would like to sample the rest of the book , it can be had by applying to the publishers , Messrs. Thacker , Spink & Co. , Calcutta `` And having said these words he hermetically sealed his lips not to open them again .
Parsing [sent. 7851 len. 61]: All the well-known doctors of Calcutta that could be procured for a man of his position and wealth were brought , -- Doctors Payne , Fayrer , and Nilmadhub Mookerjee and others ; they did what they could do , with their puissance and knack of medical knowledge , but it proved after all as if to milk the ram !
Parsing [sent. 7852 len. 44]: His wife and children had not the mournful consolation to hear his last words ; he remained sotto voce for a few hours , and then was taken from us at 6.12 P.m. according to the caprice of God which passeth understanding . ''
Parsing [sent. 7853 len. 3]: CHAPTER LXII .
Parsing [sent. 7854 len. 14]: There are no people who are quite so vulgar as the over-refined ones .
Parsing [sent. 7855 len. 9]: -- Pudd ` nhead Wilson 's New Calendar .
Parsing [sent. 7856 len. 33]: We sailed from Calcutta toward the end of March ; stopped a day at Madras ; two or three days in Ceylon ; then sailed westward on a long flight for Mauritius .
Parsing [sent. 7857 len. 7]: From my diary : April 7 .
Parsing [sent. 7858 len. 38]: We are far abroad upon the smooth waters of the Indian Ocean , now ; it is shady and pleasant and peaceful under the vast spread of the awnings , and life is perfect again -- ideal .
Parsing [sent. 7859 len. 33]: The difference between a river and the sea is , that the river looks fluid , the sea solid -- usually looks as if you could step out and walk on it .
Parsing [sent. 7860 len. 17]: The captain has this peculiarity -- he can not tell the truth in a plausible way .
Parsing [sent. 7861 len. 29]: In this he is the very opposite of the austere Scot who sits midway of the table ; he can not tell a lie in an unplausible way .
Parsing [sent. 7862 len. 26]: When the captain finishes a statement the passengers glance at each other privately , as who should say , `` Do you believe that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7863 len. 17]: When the Scot finishes one , the look says , `` How strange and interesting . ''
Parsing [sent. 7864 len. 14]: The whole secret is in the manner and method of the two men .
Parsing [sent. 7865 len. 57]: The captain is a little shy and diffident , and he states the simplest fact as if he were a little afraid of it , while the Scot delivers himself of the most abandoned lie with such an air of stern veracity that one is forced to believe it although one knows it is n't so .
Parsing [sent. 7866 len. 39]: For instance , the Scot told about a pet flying-fish he once owned , that lived in a little fountain in his conservatory , and supported itself by catching birds and frogs and rats in the neighboring fields .
Parsing [sent. 7867 len. 13]: It was plain that no one at the table doubted this statement .
Parsing [sent. 7868 len. 44]: By and by , in the course of some talk about custom-house annoyances , the captain brought out the following simple everyday incident , but through his infirmity of style managed to tell it in such a way that it got no credence .
Parsing [sent. 7869 len. 33]: He said : `` I went ashore at Naples one voyage when I was in that trade , and stood around helping my passengers , for I could speak a little Italian .
Parsing [sent. 7870 len. 36]: Two or three times , at intervals , the officer asked me if I had anything dutiable about me , and seemed more and more put out and disappointed every time I told him no .
Parsing [sent. 7871 len. 17]: Finally a passenger whom I had helped through asked me to come out and take something .
Parsing [sent. 7872 len. 20]: I thanked him , but excused myself , saying I had taken a whisky just before I came ashore .
Parsing [sent. 7873 len. 7]: `` It was a fatal admission .
Parsing [sent. 7874 len. 75]: The officer at once made me pay sixpence import-duty on the whisky-just from ship to shore , you see ; and he fined me L5 for not declaring the goods , another L5 for falsely denying that I had anything dutiable about me , also L5 for concealing the goods , and L50 for smuggling , which is the maximum penalty for unlawfully bringing in goods under the value of sevenpence ha ` penny .
Parsing [sent. 7875 len. 13]: Altogether , sixty-five pounds sixpence for a little thing like that . ''
Parsing [sent. 7876 len. 35]: The Scot is always believed , yet he never tells anything but lies ; whereas the captain is never believed , although he never tells a lie , so far as I can judge .
Parsing [sent. 7877 len. 50]: If he should say his uncle was a male person , he would probably say it in such a way that nobody would believe it ; at the same time the Scot could claim that he had a female uncle and not stir a doubt in anybody 's mind .
Parsing [sent. 7878 len. 30]: My own luck has been curious all my literary life ; I never could tell a lie that anybody would doubt , nor a truth that anybody would believe .
Parsing [sent. 7879 len. 10]: Lots of pets on board -- birds and things .
Parsing [sent. 7880 len. 15]: In these far countries the white people do seem to run remarkably to pets .
Parsing [sent. 7881 len. 22]: Our host in Cawnpore had a fine collection of birds -- the finest we saw in a private house in India .
Parsing [sent. 7882 len. 98]: And in Colombo , Dr. Murray 's great compound and commodious bungalow were well populated with domesticated company from the woods : frisky little squirrels ; a Ceylon mina walking sociably about the house ; a small green parrot that whistled a single urgent note of call without motion of its beak ; also chuckled ; a monkey in a cage on the back veranda , and some more out in the trees ; also a number of beautiful macaws in the trees ; and various and sundry birds and animals of breeds not known to me .
Parsing [sent. 7883 len. 4]: But no cat .
Parsing [sent. 7884 len. 9]: Yet a cat would have liked that place .
Parsing [sent. 7885 len. 3]: April 9 .
Parsing [sent. 7886 len. 10]: Tea-planting is the great business in Ceylon , now .
Parsing [sent. 7887 len. 10]: A passenger says it often pays 40 per cent .
Parsing [sent. 7888 len. 4]: on the investment .
Parsing [sent. 7889 len. 6]: Says there is a boom .
Parsing [sent. 7890 len. 3]: April 10 .
Parsing [sent. 7891 len. 21]: The sea is a Mediterranean blue ; and I believe that that is about the divinest color known to nature .
Parsing [sent. 7892 len. 14]: It is strange and fine -- Nature 's lavish generosities to her creatures .
Parsing [sent. 7893 len. 9]: At least to all of them except man .
Parsing [sent. 7894 len. 35]: For those that fly she has provided a home that is nobly spacious -- a home which is forty miles deep and envelops the whole globe , and has not an obstruction in it .
Parsing [sent. 7895 len. 26]: For those that swim she has provided a more than imperial domain -- a domain which is miles deep and covers four-fifths of the globe .
Parsing [sent. 7896 len. 20]: But as for man , she has cut him off with the mere odds and ends of the creation .
Parsing [sent. 7897 len. 30]: She has given him the thin skin , the meagre skin which is stretched over the remaining one-fifth -- the naked bones stick up through it in most places .
Parsing [sent. 7898 len. 21]: On the one-half of this domain he can raise snow , ice , sand , rocks , and nothing else .
Parsing [sent. 7899 len. 50]: So the valuable part of his inheritance really consists of but a single fifth of the family estate ; and out of it he has to grub hard to get enough to keep him alive and provide kings and soldiers and powder to extend the blessings of civilization with .
Parsing [sent. 7900 len. 31]: Yet man , in his simplicity and complacency and inability to cipher , thinks Nature regards him as the important member of the family -- in fact , her favorite .
Parsing [sent. 7901 len. 23]: Surely , it must occur to even his dull head , sometimes , that she has a curious way of showing it .
Parsing [sent. 7902 len. 2]: Afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 7903 len. 38]: The captain has been telling how , in one of his Arctic voyages , it was so cold that the mate 's shadow froze fast to the deck and had to be ripped loose by main strength .
Parsing [sent. 7904 len. 12]: And even then he got only about two-thirds of it back .
Parsing [sent. 7905 len. 10]: Nobody said anything , and the captain went away .
Parsing [sent. 7906 len. 10]: I think he is becoming disheartened . . . .
Parsing [sent. 7907 len. 66]: Also , to be fair , there is another word of praise due to this ship 's library : it contains no copy of the Vicar of Wakefield , that strange menagerie of complacent hypocrites and idiots , of theatrical cheap-john heroes and heroines , who are always showing off , of bad people who are not interesting , and good people who are fatiguing .
Parsing [sent. 7908 len. 4]: A singular book .
Parsing [sent. 7909 len. 47]: Not a sincere line in it , and not a character that invites respect ; a book which is one long waste-pipe discharge of goody-goody puerilities and dreary moralities ; a book which is full of pathos which revolts , and humor which grieves the heart .
Parsing [sent. 7910 len. 27]: There are few things in literature that are more piteous , more pathetic , than the celebrated `` humorous '' incident of Moses and the spectacles .
Parsing [sent. 7911 len. 13]: Jane Austen 's books , too , are absent from this library .
Parsing [sent. 7912 len. 23]: Just that one omission alone would make a fairly good library out of a library that had n't a book in it .
Parsing [sent. 7913 len. 5]: Customs in tropic seas .
Parsing [sent. 7914 len. 32]: At 5 in the morning they pipe to wash down the decks , and at once the ladies who are sleeping there turn out and they and their beds go below .
Parsing [sent. 7915 len. 30]: Then one after another the men come up from the bath in their pyjamas , and walk the decks an hour or two with bare legs and bare feet .
Parsing [sent. 7916 len. 5]: Coffee and fruit served .
Parsing [sent. 7917 len. 26]: The ship cat and her kitten now appear and get about their toilets ; next the barber comes and flays us on the breezy deck .
Parsing [sent. 7918 len. 9]: Breakfast at 9.30 , and the day begins .
Parsing [sent. 7919 len. 128]: I do not know how a day could be more reposeful : no motion ; a level blue sea ; nothing in sight from horizon to horizon ; the speed of the ship furnishes a cooling breeze ; there is no mail to read and answer ; no newspapers to excite you ; no telegrams to fret you or fright you -- the world is far , far away ; it has ceased to exist for you -- seemed a fading dream , along in the first days ; has dissolved to an unreality now ; it is gone from your mind with all its businesses and ambitions , its prosperities and disasters , its exultations and despairs , its joys and griefs and cares and worries .
Parsing [sent. 7920 len. 31]: They are no concern of yours any more ; they have gone out of your life ; they are a storm which has passed and left a deep calm behind .
Parsing [sent. 7921 len. 31]: The people group themselves about the decks in their snowy white linen , and read , smoke , sew , play cards , talk , nap , and so on .
Parsing [sent. 7922 len. 33]: In other ships the passengers are always ciphering about when they are going to arrive ; out in these seas it is rare , very rare , to hear that subject broached .
Parsing [sent. 7923 len. 55]: In other ships there is always an eager rush to the bulletin board at noon to find out what the `` run '' has been ; in these seas the bulletin seems to attract no interest ; I have seen no one visit it ; in thirteen days I have visited it only once .
Parsing [sent. 7924 len. 13]: Then I happened to notice the figures of the day 's run .
Parsing [sent. 7925 len. 19]: On that day there happened to be talk , at dinner , about the speed of modern ships .
Parsing [sent. 7926 len. 13]: I was the only passenger present who knew this ship 's gait .
Parsing [sent. 7927 len. 23]: Necessarily , the Atlantic custom of betting on the ship 's run is not a custom here -- nobody ever mentions it .
Parsing [sent. 7928 len. 35]: I myself am wholly indifferent as to when we are going to `` get in '' ; if any one else feels interested in the matter he has not indicated it in my hearing .
Parsing [sent. 7929 len. 13]: If I had my way we should never get in at all .
Parsing [sent. 7930 len. 12]: This sort of sea life is charged with an indestructible charm .
Parsing [sent. 7931 len. 22]: There is no weariness , no fatigue , no worry , no responsibility , no work , no depression of spirits .
Parsing [sent. 7932 len. 24]: There is nothing like this serenity , this comfort , this peace , this deep contentment , to be found anywhere on land .
Parsing [sent. 7933 len. 22]: If I had my way I would sail on for ever and never go to live on the solid ground again .
Parsing [sent. 7934 len. 56]: One of Kipling 's ballads has delivered the aspect and sentiment of this bewitching sea correctly : `` The Injian Ocean sets an ' smiles So sof ' , so bright , so bloomin ' blue ; There are n't a wave for miles an ' miles Excep ' the jiggle from the screw . ''
Parsing [sent. 7935 len. 3]: April 14 .
Parsing [sent. 7936 len. 22]: It turns out that the astronomical apprentice worked off a section of the Milky Way on me for the Magellan Clouds .
Parsing [sent. 7937 len. 17]: A man of more experience in the business showed one of them to me last night .
Parsing [sent. 7938 len. 29]: It was small and faint and delicate , and looked like the ghost of a bunch of white smoke left floating in the sky by an exploded bombshell .
Parsing [sent. 7939 len. 5]: Wednesday , April 15 .
Parsing [sent. 7940 len. 2]: Mauritius .
Parsing [sent. 7941 len. 43]: Arrived and anchored off Port Louis 2 A. M. Rugged clusters of crags and peaks , green to their summits ; from their bases to the sea a green plain with just tilt enough to it to make the water drain off .
Parsing [sent. 7942 len. 18]: I believe it is in 56 degrees E. and 22 degrees S. -- a hot tropical country .
Parsing [sent. 7943 len. 16]: The green plain has an inviting look ; has scattering dwellings nestling among the greenery .
Parsing [sent. 7944 len. 10]: Scene of the sentimental adventure of Paul and Virginia .
Parsing [sent. 7945 len. 21]: Island under French control -- which means a community which depends upon quarantines , not sanitation , for its health .
Parsing [sent. 7946 len. 5]: Thursday , April 16 .
Parsing [sent. 7947 len. 27]: Went ashore in the forenoon at Port Louis , a little town , but with the largest variety of nationalities and complexions we have encountered yet .
Parsing [sent. 7948 len. 32]: French , English , Chinese , Arabs , Africans with wool , blacks with straight hair , East Indians , half-whites , quadroons -- and great varieties in costumes and colors .
Parsing [sent. 7949 len. 16]: Took the train for Curepipe at 1.30 -- two hours ' run , gradually uphill .
Parsing [sent. 7950 len. 35]: What a contrast , this frantic luxuriance of vegetation , with the arid plains of India ; these architecturally picturesque crags and knobs and miniature mountains , with the monotony of the Indian dead-levels .
Parsing [sent. 7951 len. 62]: A native pointed out a handsome swarthy man of grave and dignified bearing , and said in an awed tone , `` That is so-and-so ; has held office of one sort or another under this government for 37 years -- he is known all over this whole island and in the other countries of the world perhaps -- who knows ?
Parsing [sent. 7952 len. 30]: One thing is certain ; you can speak his name anywhere in this whole island , and you will find not one grown person that has not heard it .
Parsing [sent. 7953 len. 32]: It is a wonderful thing to be so celebrated ; yet look at him ; it makes no change in him ; he does not even seem to know it . ''
Parsing [sent. 7954 len. 10]: Curepipe -LRB- means Pincushion or Pegtown , probably -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 7955 len. 12]: Sixteen miles -LRB- two hours -RRB- by rail from Port Louis .
Parsing [sent. 7956 len. 43]: At each end of every roof and on the apex of every dormer window a wooden peg two feet high stands up ; in some cases its top is blunt , in others the peg is sharp and looks like a toothpick .
Parsing [sent. 7957 len. 9]: The passion for this humble ornament is universal .
Parsing [sent. 7958 len. 22]: Apparently , there has been only one prominent event in the history of Mauritius , and that one did n't happen .
Parsing [sent. 7959 len. 12]: I refer to the romantic sojourn of Paul and Virginia here .
Parsing [sent. 7960 len. 27]: It was that story that made Mauritius known to the world , made the name familiar to everybody , the geographical position of it to nobody .
Parsing [sent. 7961 len. 15]: A clergyman was asked to guess what was in a box on a table .
Parsing [sent. 7962 len. 21]: It was a vellum fan painted with the shipwreck , and was `` one of Virginia 's wedding gifts . ''
Parsing [sent. 7963 len. 3]: April 18 .
Parsing [sent. 7964 len. 23]: This is the only country in the world where the stranger is not asked `` How do you like this place ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7965 len. 7]: This is indeed a large distinction .
Parsing [sent. 7966 len. 19]: Here the citizen does the talking about the country himself ; the stranger is not asked to help .
Parsing [sent. 7967 len. 7]: You get all sorts of information .
Parsing [sent. 7968 len. 25]: From one citizen you gather the idea that Mauritius was made first , and then heaven ; and that heaven was copied after Mauritius .
Parsing [sent. 7969 len. 50]: Another one tells you that this is an exaggeration ; that the two chief villages , Port Louis and Curepipe , fall short of heavenly perfection ; that nobody lives in Port Louis except upon compulsion , and that Curepipe is the wettest and rainiest place in the world .
Parsing [sent. 7970 len. 49]: An English citizen said : `` In the early part of this century Mauritius was used by the French as a basis from which to operate against England 's Indian merchantmen ; so England captured the island and also the neighbor , Bourbon , to stop that annoyance .
Parsing [sent. 7971 len. 20]: England gave Bourbon back ; the government in London did not want any more possessions in the West Indies .
Parsing [sent. 7972 len. 23]: If the government had had a better quality of geography in stock it would not have wasted Bourbon in that foolish way .
Parsing [sent. 7973 len. 42]: A big war will temporarily shut up the Suez Canal some day and the English ships will have to go to India around the Cape of Good Hope again ; then England will have to have Bourbon and will take it .
Parsing [sent. 7974 len. 53]: `` Mauritius was a crown colony until 20 years ago , with a governor appointed by the Crown and assisted by a Council appointed by himself ; but Pope Hennessey came out as Governor then , and he worked hard to get a part of the council made elective , and succeeded .
Parsing [sent. 7975 len. 28]: So now the whole council is French , and in all ordinary matters of legislation they vote together and in the French interest , not the English .
Parsing [sent. 7976 len. 17]: The English population is very slender ; it has not votes enough to elect a legislator .
Parsing [sent. 7977 len. 10]: Half a dozen rich French families elect the legislature .
Parsing [sent. 7978 len. 56]: Pope Hennessey was an Irishman , a Catholic , a Home Ruler , M.P. , a hater of England and the English , a very troublesome person and a serious incumbrance at Westminster ; so it was decided to send him out to govern unhealthy countries , in hope that something would happen to him .
Parsing [sent. 7979 len. 4]: But nothing did .
Parsing [sent. 7980 len. 16]: The first experiment was not merely a failure , it was more than a failure .
Parsing [sent. 7981 len. 17]: He proved to be more of a disease himself than any he was sent to encounter .
Parsing [sent. 7982 len. 6]: The next experiment was here .
Parsing [sent. 7983 len. 6]: The dark scheme failed again .
Parsing [sent. 7984 len. 15]: It was an off-season and there was nothing but measles here at the time .
Parsing [sent. 7985 len. 8]: Pope Hennessey 's health was not affected .
Parsing [sent. 7986 len. 42]: He worked with the French and for the French and against the English , and he made the English very tired and the French very happy , and lived to have the joy of seeing the flag he served publicly hissed .
Parsing [sent. 7987 len. 13]: His memory is held in worshipful reverence and affection by the French .
Parsing [sent. 7988 len. 9]: `` It is a land of extraordinary quarantines .
Parsing [sent. 7989 len. 19]: They quarantine a ship for anything or for nothing ; quarantine her for 20 and even 30 days .
Parsing [sent. 7990 len. 18]: They once quarantined a ship because her captain had had the smallpox when he was a boy .
Parsing [sent. 7991 len. 7]: That and because he was English .
Parsing [sent. 7992 len. 11]: `` The population is very small ; small to insignificance .
Parsing [sent. 7993 len. 28]: The majority is East Indian ; then mongrels ; then negroes -LRB- descendants of the slaves of the French times -RRB- ; then French ; then English .
Parsing [sent. 7994 len. 12]: There was an American , but he is dead or mislaid .
Parsing [sent. 7995 len. 27]: The mongrels are the result of all kinds of mixtures ; black and white , mulatto and white , quadroon and white , octoroon and white .
Parsing [sent. 7996 len. 50]: And so there is every shade of complexion ; ebony , old mahogany , horsechestnut , sorrel , molasses-candy , clouded amber , clear amber , old-ivory white , new-ivory white , fish-belly white -- this latter the leprous complexion frequent with the Anglo-Saxon long resident in tropical climates .
Parsing [sent. 7997 len. 19]: `` You would n't expect a person to be proud of being a Mauritian , now would you ?
Parsing [sent. 7998 len. 5]: But it is so .
Parsing [sent. 7999 len. 57]: The most of them have never been out of the island , and have n't read much or studied much , and they think the world consists of three principal countries -- Judaea , France , and Mauritius ; so they are very proud of belonging to one of the three grand divisions of the globe .
Parsing [sent. 8000 len. 19]: They think that Russia and Germany are in England , and that England does not amount to much .
Parsing [sent. 8001 len. 21]: They have heard vaguely about the United States and the equator , but they think both of them are monarchies .
Parsing [sent. 8002 len. 62]: They think Mount Peter Botte is the highest mountain in the world , and if you show one of them a picture of Milan Cathedral he will swell up with satisfaction and say that the idea of that jungle of spires was stolen from the forest of peg-tops and toothpicks that makes the roofs of Curepipe look so fine and prickly .
Parsing [sent. 8003 len. 9]: `` There is not much trade in books .
Parsing [sent. 8004 len. 8]: The newspapers educate and entertain the people .
Parsing [sent. 8005 len. 4]: Mainly the latter .
Parsing [sent. 8006 len. 15]: They have two pages of large-print reading-matter-one of them English , the other French .
Parsing [sent. 8007 len. 11]: The English page is a translation of the French one .
Parsing [sent. 8008 len. 16]: The typography is super-extra primitive -- in this quality it has not its equal anywhere .
Parsing [sent. 8009 len. 10]: There is no proof-reader now ; he is dead .
Parsing [sent. 8010 len. 24]: `` Where do they get matter to fill up a page in this little island lost in the wastes of the Indian Ocean ?
Parsing [sent. 8011 len. 4]: Oh , Madagascar .
Parsing [sent. 8012 len. 6]: They discuss Madagascar and France .
Parsing [sent. 8013 len. 5]: That is the bulk .
Parsing [sent. 8014 len. 12]: Then they chock up the rest with advice to the Government .
Parsing [sent. 8015 len. 8]: Also , slurs upon the English administration .
Parsing [sent. 8016 len. 12]: The papers are all owned and edited by creoles -- French .
Parsing [sent. 8017 len. 9]: `` The language of the country is French .
Parsing [sent. 8018 len. 7]: Everybody speaks it -- has to .
Parsing [sent. 8019 len. 31]: You have to know French particularly mongrel French , the patois spoken by Tom , Dick , and Harry of the multiform complexions -- or you ca n't get along .
Parsing [sent. 8020 len. 55]: `` This was a flourishing country in former days , for it made then and still makes the best sugar in the world ; but first the Suez Canal severed it from the world and left it out in the cold and next the beetroot sugar helped by bounties , captured the European markets .
Parsing [sent. 8021 len. 14]: Sugar is the life of Mauritius , and it is losing its grip .
Parsing [sent. 8022 len. 57]: Its downward course was checked by the depreciation of the rupee -- for the planter pays wages in rupees but sells his crop for gold -- and the insurrection in Cuba and paralyzation of the sugar industry there have given our prices here a life-saving lift ; but the outlook has nothing permanently favorable about it .
Parsing [sent. 8023 len. 38]: It takes a year to mature the canes -- on the high ground three and six months longer -- and there is always a chance that the annual cyclone will rip the profit out of the crop .
Parsing [sent. 8024 len. 24]: In recent times a cyclone took the whole crop , as you may say ; and the island never saw a finer one .
Parsing [sent. 8025 len. 14]: Some of the noblest sugar estates in the island are in deep difficulties .
Parsing [sent. 8026 len. 39]: A dozen of them are investments of English capital ; and the companies that own them are at work now , trying to settle up and get out with a saving of half the money they put in .
Parsing [sent. 8027 len. 29]: You know , in these days , when a country begins to introduce the tea culture , it means that its own specialty has gone back on it .
Parsing [sent. 8028 len. 8]: Look at Bengal ; look at Ceylon .
Parsing [sent. 8029 len. 13]: Well , they 've begun to introduce the tea culture , here .
Parsing [sent. 8030 len. 14]: `` Many copies of Paul and Virginia are sold every year in Mauritius .
Parsing [sent. 8031 len. 11]: No other book is so popular here except the Bible .
Parsing [sent. 8032 len. 13]: By many it is supposed to be a part of the Bible .
Parsing [sent. 8033 len. 19]: All the missionaries work up their French on it when they come here to pervert the Catholic mongrel .
Parsing [sent. 8034 len. 18]: It is the greatest story that was ever written about Mauritius , and the only one . ''
Parsing [sent. 8035 len. 3]: CHAPTER LXIII .
Parsing [sent. 8036 len. 18]: The principal difference between a cat and a lie is that the cat has only nine lives .
Parsing [sent. 8037 len. 9]: -- Pudd ` nhead Wilson 's New Calendar .
Parsing [sent. 8038 len. 3]: April 20 .
Parsing [sent. 8039 len. 31]: -- The cyclone of 1892 killed and crippled hundreds of people ; it was accompanied by a deluge of rain , which drowned Port Louis and produced a water famine .
Parsing [sent. 8040 len. 30]: Quite true ; for it burst the reservoir and the water-pipes ; and for a time after the flood had disappeared there was much distress from want of water .
Parsing [sent. 8041 len. 18]: This is the only place in the world where no breed of matches can stand the damp .
Parsing [sent. 8042 len. 8]: Only one match in 16 will light .
Parsing [sent. 8043 len. 57]: The roads are hard and smooth ; some of the compounds are spacious , some of the bungalows commodious , and the roadways are walled by tall bamboo hedges , trim and green and beautiful ; and there are azalea hedges , too , both the white and the red ; I never saw that before .
Parsing [sent. 8044 len. 75]: As to healthiness : I translate from to-day 's -LRB- April 20 -RRB- Merchants ' and Planters ' Gazette , from the article of a regular contributor , `` Carminge , '' concerning the death of the nephew of a prominent citizen : `` Sad and lugubrious existence , this which we lead in Mauritius ; I believe there is no other country in the world where one dies more easily than among us .
Parsing [sent. 8045 len. 39]: The least indisposition becomes a mortal malady ; a simple headache develops into meningitis ; a cold into pneumonia , and presently , when we are least expecting it , death is a guest in our home . ''
Parsing [sent. 8046 len. 18]: This daily paper has a meteorological report which tells you what the weather was day before yesterday .
Parsing [sent. 8047 len. 21]: One is never pestered by a beggar or a peddler in this town , so far as I can see .
Parsing [sent. 8048 len. 7]: This is pleasantly different from India .
Parsing [sent. 8049 len. 3]: April 22 .
Parsing [sent. 8050 len. 42]: To such as believe that the quaint product called French civilization would be an improvement upon the civilization of New Guinea and the like , the snatching of Madagascar and the laying on of French civilization there will be fully justified .
Parsing [sent. 8051 len. 12]: But why did the English allow the French to have Madagascar ?
Parsing [sent. 8052 len. 12]: Did she respect a theft of a couple of centuries ago ?
Parsing [sent. 8053 len. 24]: Dear me , robbery by European nations of each other 's territories has never been a sin , is not a sin to-day .
Parsing [sent. 8054 len. 46]: To the several cabinets the several political establishments of the world are clotheslines ; and a large part of the official duty of these cabinets is to keep an eye on each other 's wash and grab what they can of it as opportunity offers .
Parsing [sent. 8055 len. 28]: All the territorial possessions of all the political establishments in the earth -- including America , of course -- consist of pilferings from other people 's wash .
Parsing [sent. 8056 len. 23]: No tribe , howsoever insignificant , and no nation , howsoever mighty , occupies a foot of land that was not stolen .
Parsing [sent. 8057 len. 43]: When the English , the French , and the Spaniards reached America , the Indian tribes had been raiding each other 's territorial clothes-lines for ages , and every acre of ground in the continent had been stolen and re-stolen 500 times .
Parsing [sent. 8058 len. 37]: The English , the French , and the Spaniards went to work and stole it all over again ; and when that was satisfactorily accomplished they went diligently to work and stole it from each other .
Parsing [sent. 8059 len. 18]: In Europe and Asia and Africa every acre of ground has been stolen several millions of times .
Parsing [sent. 8060 len. 18]: A crime persevered in a thousand centuries ceases to be a crime , and becomes a virtue .
Parsing [sent. 8061 len. 16]: This is the law of custom , and custom supersedes all other forms of law .
Parsing [sent. 8062 len. 45]: Christian governments are as frank to-day , as open and above-board , in discussing projects for raiding each other 's clothes-lines as ever they were before the Golden Rule came smiling into this inhospitable world and could n't get a night 's lodging anywhere .
Parsing [sent. 8063 len. 29]: In 150 years England has beneficently retired garment after garment from the Indian lines , until there is hardly a rag of the original wash left dangling anywhere .
Parsing [sent. 8064 len. 44]: In 800 years an obscure tribe of Muscovite savages has risen to the dazzling position of Land-Robber-in-Chief ; she found a quarter of the world hanging out to dry on a hundred parallels of latitude , and she scooped in the whole wash .
Parsing [sent. 8065 len. 35]: She keeps a sharp eye on a multitude of little lines that stretch along the northern boundaries of India , and every now and then she snatches a hip-rag or a pair of pyjamas .
Parsing [sent. 8066 len. 19]: It is England 's prospective property , and Russia knows it ; but Russia cares nothing for that .
Parsing [sent. 8067 len. 17]: In fact , in our day land-robbery , claim-jumping , is become a European governmental frenzy .
Parsing [sent. 8068 len. 34]: Some have been hard at it in the borders of China , in Burma , in Siam , and the islands of the sea ; and all have been at it in Africa .
Parsing [sent. 8069 len. 24]: Africa has been as coolly divided up and portioned out among the gang as if they had bought it and paid for it .
Parsing [sent. 8070 len. 18]: And now straightway they are beginning the old game again -- to steal each other 's grabbings .
Parsing [sent. 8071 len. 75]: Germany found a vast slice of Central Africa with the English flag and the English missionary and the English trader scattered all over it , but with certain formalities neglected -- no signs up , `` Keep off the grass , '' `` Trespassers-forbidden , '' etc. -- and she stepped in with a cold calm smile and put up the signs herself , and swept those English pioneers promptly out of the country .
Parsing [sent. 8072 len. 7]: There is a tremendous point there .
Parsing [sent. 8073 len. 22]: It can be put into the form of a maxim : Get your formalities right -- never mind about the moralities .
Parsing [sent. 8074 len. 15]: It was an impudent thing ; but England had to put up with it .
Parsing [sent. 8075 len. 26]: Now , in the case of Madagascar , the formalities had originally been observed , but by neglect they had fallen into desuetude ages ago .
Parsing [sent. 8076 len. 10]: England should have snatched Madagascar from the French clothes-line .
Parsing [sent. 8077 len. 24]: Without an effort she could have saved those harmless natives from the calamity of French civilization , and she did not do it .
Parsing [sent. 8078 len. 6]: Now it is too late .
Parsing [sent. 8079 len. 14]: The signs of the times show plainly enough what is going to happen .
Parsing [sent. 8080 len. 21]: All the savage lands in the world are going to be brought under subjection to the Christian governments of Europe .
Parsing [sent. 8081 len. 8]: I am not sorry , but glad .
Parsing [sent. 8082 len. 28]: This coming fate might have been a calamity to those savage peoples two hundred years ago ; but now it will in some cases be a benefaction .
Parsing [sent. 8083 len. 13]: The sooner the seizure is consummated , the better for the savages .
Parsing [sent. 8084 len. 24]: The dreary and dragging ages of bloodshed and disorder and oppression will give place to peace and order and the reign of law .
Parsing [sent. 8085 len. 60]: When one considers what India was under her Hindoo and Mohammedan rulers , and what she is now ; when he remembers the miseries of her millions then and the protections and humanities which they enjoy now , he must concede that the most fortunate thing that has ever befallen that empire was the establishment of British supremacy there .
Parsing [sent. 8086 len. 22]: The savage lands of the world are to pass to alien possession , their peoples to the mercies of alien rulers .
Parsing [sent. 8087 len. 14]: Let us hope and believe that they will all benefit by the change .
Parsing [sent. 8088 len. 3]: April 23 .
Parsing [sent. 8089 len. 27]: `` The first year they gather shells ; the second year they gather shells and drink ; the third year they do not gather shells . ''
Parsing [sent. 8090 len. 8]: -LRB- Said of immigrants to Mauritius . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 8091 len. 3]: Population 375,000 .
Parsing [sent. 8092 len. 4]: 120 sugar factories .
Parsing [sent. 8093 len. 5]: Population 1851 , 185,000 .
Parsing [sent. 8094 len. 12]: The increase is due mainly to the introduction of Indian coolies .
Parsing [sent. 8095 len. 11]: They now apparently form the great majority of the population .
Parsing [sent. 8096 len. 13]: They are admirable breeders ; their homes are always hazy with children .
Parsing [sent. 8097 len. 5]: Great savers of money .
Parsing [sent. 8098 len. 41]: A British officer told me that in India he paid his servant 10 rupees a month , and he had 11 cousins , uncles , parents , etc. , dependent upon him , and he supported them on his wages .
Parsing [sent. 8099 len. 28]: These thrifty coolies are said to be acquiring land a trifle at a time , and cultivating it ; and may own the island by and by .
Parsing [sent. 8100 len. 30]: The Indian women do very hard labor for wages running from 40 one hundredths of a rupee for twelve hours ' work to 50 one hundredths of a rupee .
Parsing [sent. 8101 len. 31]: They carry mats of sugar on their heads -LRB- 70 pounds -RRB- all day lading ships , for half a rupee , and work at gardening all day for less .
Parsing [sent. 8102 len. 11]: The camaron is a fresh water creature like a cray-fish .
Parsing [sent. 8103 len. 17]: It is regarded here as the world 's chiefest delicacy -- and certainly it is good .
Parsing [sent. 8104 len. 9]: Guards patrol the streams to prevent poaching it .
Parsing [sent. 8105 len. 14]: A fine of Rs .200 or 300 -LRB- they say -RRB- for poaching .
Parsing [sent. 8106 len. 82]: Bait is thrown in the water ; the camaron goes for it ; the fisher drops his loop in and works it around and about the camaron he has selected , till he gets it over its tail ; then there 's a jerk or something to certify the camaron that it is his turn now ; he suddenly backs away , which moves the loop still further up his person and draws it taut , and his days are ended .
Parsing [sent. 8107 len. 22]: Another dish , called palmiste , is like raw turnip-shavings and tastes like green almonds ; is very delicate and good .
Parsing [sent. 8108 len. 19]: Costs the life of a palm tree 12 to 20 years old -- for it is the pith .
Parsing [sent. 8109 len. 21]: Another dish -- looks like greens or a tangle of fine seaweed -- is a preparation of the deadly nightshade .
Parsing [sent. 8110 len. 3]: Good enough .
Parsing [sent. 8111 len. 25]: The monkeys live in the dense forests on the flanks of the toy mountains , and they flock down nights and raid the sugar-fields .
Parsing [sent. 8112 len. 29]: Also on other estates they come down and destroy a sort of bean-crop -- just for fun , apparently -- tear off the pods and throw them down .
Parsing [sent. 8113 len. 34]: The cyclone of 1892 tore down two great blocks of stone buildings in the center of Port Louis -- the chief architectural feature -- and left the uncomely and apparently frail blocks standing .
Parsing [sent. 8114 len. 17]: Everywhere in its track it annihilated houses , tore off roofs , destroyed trees and crops .
Parsing [sent. 8115 len. 43]: The men were in the towns , the women and children at home in the country getting crippled , killed , frightened to insanity ; and the rain deluging them , the wind howling , the thunder crashing , the lightning glaring .
Parsing [sent. 8116 len. 7]: This for an hour or so .
Parsing [sent. 8117 len. 30]: Then a lull and sunshine ; many ventured out of safe shelter ; then suddenly here it came again from the opposite point and renewed and completed the devastation .
Parsing [sent. 8118 len. 14]: It is said the Chinese fed the sufferers for days on free rice .
Parsing [sent. 8119 len. 11]: Whole streets in Port Louis were laid flat -- wrecked .
Parsing [sent. 8120 len. 28]: During a minute and a half the wind blew 123 miles an hour ; no official record made after that , when it may have reached 150 .
Parsing [sent. 8121 len. 6]: It cut down an obelisk .
Parsing [sent. 8122 len. 16]: It carried an American ship into the woods after breaking the chains of two anchors .
Parsing [sent. 8123 len. 9]: They now use four-two forward , two astern .
Parsing [sent. 8124 len. 16]: Common report says it killed 1,200 in Port Louis alone , in half an hour .
Parsing [sent. 8125 len. 39]: Then came the lull of the central calm -- people did not know the barometer was still going down -- then suddenly all perdition broke loose again while people were rushing around seeking friends and rescuing the wounded .
Parsing [sent. 8126 len. 24]: The noise was comparable to nothing ; there is nothing resembling it but thunder and cannon , and these are feeble in comparison .
Parsing [sent. 8127 len. 8]: What there is of Mauritius is beautiful .
Parsing [sent. 8128 len. 130]: You have undulating wide expanses of sugar-cane -- a fine , fresh green and very pleasant to the eye ; and everywhere else you have a ragged luxuriance of tropic vegetation of vivid greens of varying shades , a wild tangle of underbrush , with graceful tall palms lifting their crippled plumes high above it ; and you have stretches of shady dense forest with limpid streams frolicking through them , continually glimpsed and lost and glimpsed again in the pleasantest hide-and-seek fashion ; and you have some tiny mountains , some quaint and picturesque groups of toy peaks , and a dainty little vest-pocket Matterhorn ; and here and there and now and then a strip of sea with a white ruffle of surf breaks into the view .
Parsing [sent. 8129 len. 8]: That is Mauritius ; and pretty enough .
Parsing [sent. 8130 len. 27]: The details are few , the massed result is charming , but not imposing ; not riotous , not exciting ; it is a Sunday landscape .
Parsing [sent. 8131 len. 12]: Perspective , and the enchantments wrought by distance , are wanting .
Parsing [sent. 8132 len. 14]: There are no distances ; there is no perspective , so to speak .
Parsing [sent. 8133 len. 13]: Fifteen miles as the crow flies is the usual limit of vision .
Parsing [sent. 8134 len. 9]: Mauritius is a garden and a park combined .
Parsing [sent. 8135 len. 12]: It affects one 's emotions as parks and gardens affect them .
Parsing [sent. 8136 len. 22]: The surfaces of one 's spiritual deeps are pleasantly played upon , the deeps themselves are not reached , not stirred .
Parsing [sent. 8137 len. 40]: Spaciousness , remote altitudes , the sense of mystery which haunts apparently inaccessible mountain domes and summits reposing in the sky -- these are the things which exalt the spirit and move it to see visions and dream dreams .
Parsing [sent. 8138 len. 17]: The Sandwich Islands remain my ideal of the perfect thing in the matter of tropical islands .
Parsing [sent. 8139 len. 59]: I would add another story to Mauna Loa 's 16,000 feet if I could , and make it particularly bold and steep and craggy and forbidding and snowy ; and I would make the volcano spout its lava-floods out of its summit instead of its sides ; but aside from these non-essentials I have no corrections to suggest .
Parsing [sent. 8140 len. 20]: I hope these will be attended to ; I do not wish to have to speak of it again .
Parsing [sent. 8141 len. 3]: CHAPTER LXIV .
Parsing [sent. 8142 len. 28]: When your watch gets out of order you have choice of two things to do : throw it in the fire or take it to the watch-tinker .

Parsing [sent. 8144 len. 9]: -- Pudd ` nhead Wilson 's New Calendar .
Parsing [sent. 8145 len. 14]: The Arundel Castle is the finest boat I have seen in these seas .
Parsing [sent. 8146 len. 15]: She is thoroughly modern , and that statement covers a great deal of ground .
Parsing [sent. 8147 len. 33]: She has the usual defect , the common defect , the universal defect , the defect that has never been missing from any ship that ever sailed -- she has imperfect beds .
Parsing [sent. 8148 len. 14]: Many ships have good beds , but no ship has very good ones .
Parsing [sent. 8149 len. 19]: In the matter of beds all ships have been badly edited , ignorantly edited , from the beginning .
Parsing [sent. 8150 len. 34]: The selection of the beds is given to some hearty , strong-backed , self-made man , when it ought to be given to a frail woman accustomed from girlhood to backaches and insomnia .
Parsing [sent. 8151 len. 24]: Nothing is so rare , on either side of the ocean , as a perfect bed ; nothing is so difficult to make .
Parsing [sent. 8152 len. 19]: Some of the hotels on both sides provide it , but no ship ever does or ever did .
Parsing [sent. 8153 len. 10]: In Noah 's Ark the beds were simply scandalous .
Parsing [sent. 8154 len. 21]: Noah set the fashion , and it will endure in one degree of modification or another till the next flood .
Parsing [sent. 8155 len. 7]: 8 A.M. Passing Isle de Bourbon .
Parsing [sent. 8156 len. 9]: Broken-up sky-line of volcanic mountains in the middle .
Parsing [sent. 8157 len. 22]: Surely it would not cost much to repair them , and it seems inexcusable neglect to leave them as they are .
Parsing [sent. 8158 len. 12]: It seems stupid to send tired men to Europe to rest .
Parsing [sent. 8159 len. 45]: It is no proper rest for the mind to clatter from town to town in the dust and cinders , and examine galleries and architecture , and be always meeting people and lunching and teaing and dining , and receiving worrying cables and letters .
Parsing [sent. 8160 len. 20]: And a sea voyage on the Atlantic is of no use -- voyage too short , sea too rough .
Parsing [sent. 8161 len. 17]: The peaceful Indian and Pacific Oceans and the long stretches of time are the healing thing .
Parsing [sent. 8162 len. 5]: May 2 , AM .
Parsing [sent. 8163 len. 21]: A fair , great ship in sight , almost the first we have seen in these weeks of lonely voyaging .
Parsing [sent. 8164 len. 21]: We are now in the Mozambique Channel , between Madagascar and South Africa , sailing straight west for Delagoa Bay .
Parsing [sent. 8165 len. 78]: Last night , the burly chief engineer , middle-aged , was standing telling a spirited seafaring tale , and had reached the most exciting place , where a man overboard was washing swiftly astern on the great seas , and uplifting despairing cries , everybody racing aft in a frenzy of excitement and fading hope , when the band , which had been silent a moment , began impressively its closing piece , the English national anthem .
Parsing [sent. 8166 len. 35]: As simply as if he was unconscious of what he was doing , he stopped his story , uncovered , laid his laced cap against his breast , and slightly bent his grizzled head .
Parsing [sent. 8167 len. 32]: The few bars finished , he put on his cap and took up his tale again , as naturally as if that interjection of music had been a part of it .
Parsing [sent. 8168 len. 75]: There was something touching and fine about it , and it was moving to reflect that he was one of a myriad , scattered over every part of the globe , who by turn was doing as he was doing every hour of the twenty-four -- those awake doing it while the others slept -- those impressive bars forever floating up out of the various climes , never silent and never lacking reverent listeners .
Parsing [sent. 8169 len. 45]: All that I remember about Madagascar is that Thackeray 's little Billie went up to the top of the mast and there knelt him upon his knee , saying , `` I see `` Jerusalem and Madagascar , And North and South Amerikee . ''
Parsing [sent. 8170 len. 3]: May 3 .
Parsing [sent. 8171 len. 2]: Sunday .
Parsing [sent. 8172 len. 38]: Fifteen or twenty Africanders who will end their voyage to-day and strike for their several homes from Delagoa Bay to-morrow , sat up singing on the afterdeck in the moonlight till 3 A.M. Good fun and wholesome .
Parsing [sent. 8173 len. 17]: And the songs were clean songs , and some of them were hallowed by tender associations .
Parsing [sent. 8174 len. 26]: Finally , in a pause , a man asked , `` Have you heard about the fellow that kept a diary crossing the Atlantic ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8175 len. 9]: It was a discord , a wet blanket .
Parsing [sent. 8176 len. 11]: The men were not in the mood for humorous dirt .
Parsing [sent. 8177 len. 33]: The songs had carried them to their homes , and in spirit they sat by those far hearthstones , and saw faces and heard voices other than those that were about them .
Parsing [sent. 8178 len. 18]: And so this disposition to drag in an old indecent anecdote got no welcome ; nobody answered .
Parsing [sent. 8179 len. 20]: The poor man had n't wit enough to see that he had blundered , but asked his question again .
Parsing [sent. 8180 len. 6]: Again there was no response .
Parsing [sent. 8181 len. 6]: It was embarrassing for him .
Parsing [sent. 8182 len. 18]: In his confusion he chose the wrong course , did the wrong thing -- began the anecdote .
Parsing [sent. 8183 len. 21]: Began it in a deep and hostile stillness , where had been such life and stir and warm comradeship before .
Parsing [sent. 8184 len. 27]: He delivered himself of the brief details of the diary 's first day , and did it with some confidence and a fair degree of eagerness .
Parsing [sent. 8185 len. 4]: It fell flat .
Parsing [sent. 8186 len. 6]: There was an awkward pause .
Parsing [sent. 8187 len. 9]: The two rows of men sat like statues .
Parsing [sent. 8188 len. 8]: There was no movement , no sound .
Parsing [sent. 8189 len. 25]: He had to go on ; there was no other way , at least none that an animal of his calibre could think of .
Parsing [sent. 8190 len. 15]: At the close of each day 's diary , the same dismal silence followed .
Parsing [sent. 8191 len. 29]: When at last he finished his tale and sprung the indelicate surprise which is wont to fetch a crash of laughter , not a ripple of sound resulted .
Parsing [sent. 8192 len. 13]: It was as if the tale had been told to dead men .
Parsing [sent. 8193 len. 43]: After what seemed a long , long time , somebody sighed , somebody else stirred in his seat ; presently , the men dropped into a low murmur of confidential talk , each with his neighbor , and the incident was closed .
Parsing [sent. 8194 len. 30]: There were indications that that man was fond of his anecdote ; that it was his pet , his standby , his shot that never missed , his reputation-maker .
Parsing [sent. 8195 len. 8]: But he will never tell it again .
Parsing [sent. 8196 len. 126]: No doubt he will think of it sometimes , for that can not well be helped ; and then he will see a picture , and always the same picture -- the double rank of dead men ; the vacant deck stretching away in dimming perspective beyond them , the wide desert of smooth sea all abroad ; the rim of the moon spying from behind a rag of black cloud ; the remote top of the mizzenmast shearing a zigzag path through the fields of stars in the deeps of space ; and this soft picture will remind him of the time that he sat in the midst of it and told his poor little tale and felt so lonesome when he got through .
Parsing [sent. 8197 len. 57]: Fifty Indians and Chinamen asleep in a big tent in the waist of the ship forward ; they lie side by side with no space between ; the former wrapped up , head and all , as in the Indian streets , the Chinamen uncovered ; the lamp and things for opium smoking in the center .
Parsing [sent. 8198 len. 17]: A passenger said it was ten 2-ton truck loads of dynamite that lately exploded at Johannesburg .
Parsing [sent. 8199 len. 17]: Hundreds killed ; he does n't know how many ; limbs picked up for miles around .
Parsing [sent. 8200 len. 23]: Glass shattered , and roofs swept away or collapsed 200 yards off ; fragment of iron flung three and a half miles .
Parsing [sent. 8201 len. 15]: It occurred at 3 p.m. ; at 6 , L65 ,000 had been subscribed .
Parsing [sent. 8202 len. 24]: When this passenger left , L35 ,000 had been voted by city and state governments and L100 ,000 by citizens and business corporations .
Parsing [sent. 8203 len. 20]: When news of the disaster was telephoned to the Exchange L35 ,000 were subscribed in the first five minutes .
Parsing [sent. 8204 len. 28]: Subscribing was still going on when he left ; the papers had ceased the names , only the amounts -- too many names ; not enough room .
Parsing [sent. 8205 len. 65]: L100 ,000 subscribed by companies and citizens ; if this is true , it must be what they call in Australia `` a record '' -- the biggest instance of a spontaneous outpour for charity in history , considering the size of the population it was drawn from , $ 8 or $ 10 for each white resident , babies at the breast included .
Parsing [sent. 8206 len. 5]: Monday , May 4 .
Parsing [sent. 8207 len. 20]: Steaming slowly in the stupendous Delagoa Bay , its dim arms stretching far away and disappearing on both sides .
Parsing [sent. 8208 len. 19]: It could furnish plenty of room for all the ships in the world , but it is shoal .
Parsing [sent. 8209 len. 19]: The lead has given us 3 1/2 fathoms several times and we are drawing that , lacking 6 inches .
Parsing [sent. 8210 len. 23]: A bold headland -- precipitous wall , 150 feet high , very strong , red color , stretching a mile or so .
Parsing [sent. 8211 len. 17]: A man said it was Portuguese blood -- battle fought here with the natives last year .
Parsing [sent. 8212 len. 5]: I think this doubtful .
Parsing [sent. 8213 len. 24]: Pretty cluster of houses on the tableland above the red -- and rolling stretches of grass and groups of trees , like England .
Parsing [sent. 8214 len. 26]: The Portuguese have the railroad -LRB- one passenger train a day -RRB- to the border -- 70 miles -- then the Netherlands Company have it .
Parsing [sent. 8215 len. 12]: Thousands of tons of freight on the shore -- no cover .
Parsing [sent. 8216 len. 13]: This is Portuguese allover -- indolence , piousness , poverty , impotence .
Parsing [sent. 8217 len. 16]: Crews of small boats and tugs , all jet black woolly heads and very muscular .
Parsing [sent. 8218 len. 2]: Winter .
Parsing [sent. 8219 len. 20]: The South African winter is just beginning now , but nobody but an expert can tell it from summer .
Parsing [sent. 8220 len. 17]: However , I am tired of summer ; we have had it unbroken for eleven months .
Parsing [sent. 8221 len. 10]: We spent the afternoon on shore , Delagoa Bay .
Parsing [sent. 8222 len. 7]: A small town -- no sights .
Parsing [sent. 8223 len. 3]: No carriages .
Parsing [sent. 8224 len. 14]: Three ` rickshas , but we could n't get them -- apparently private .
Parsing [sent. 8225 len. 13]: These Portuguese are a rich brown , like some of the Indians .
Parsing [sent. 8226 len. 46]: Some of the blacks have the long horse heads and very long chins of the negroes of the picture books ; but most of them are exactly like the negroes of our Southern States round faces , flat noses , good-natured , and easy laughers .
Parsing [sent. 8227 len. 17]: Flocks of black women passed along , carrying outrageously heavy bags of freight on their heads .
Parsing [sent. 8228 len. 28]: The quiver of their leg as the foot was planted and the strain exhibited by their bodies showed what a tax upon their strength the load was .
Parsing [sent. 8229 len. 10]: They were stevedores and doing full stevedore 's work .
Parsing [sent. 8230 len. 20]: They were very erect when unladden -- from carrying weights on their heads -- just like the Indian women .
Parsing [sent. 8231 len. 8]: It gives them a proud fine carriage .
Parsing [sent. 8232 len. 39]: Sometimes one saw a woman carrying on her head a laden and top-heavy basket the shape of an inverted pyramid -- its top the size of a soup - plate , its base the diameter of a teacup .
Parsing [sent. 8233 len. 9]: It required nice balancing -- and got it .
Parsing [sent. 8234 len. 12]: No bright colors ; yet there were a good many Hindoos .
Parsing [sent. 8235 len. 35]: The Second Class Passenger came over as usual at `` lights out '' -LRB- 11 -RRB- and we lounged along the spacious vague solitudes of the deck and smoked the peaceful pipe and talked .
Parsing [sent. 8236 len. 39]: He told me an incident in Mr. Barnum 's life which was evidently characteristic of that great showman in several ways : This was Barnum 's purchase of Shakespeare 's birthplace , a quarter of a century ago .
Parsing [sent. 8237 len. 17]: The Second Class Passenger was in Jamrach 's employ at the time and knew Barnum well .
Parsing [sent. 8238 len. 9]: He said the thing began in this way .
Parsing [sent. 8239 len. 56]: One morning Barnum and Jamrach were in Jamrach 's little private snuggery back of the wilderness of caged monkeys and snakes and other commonplaces of Jamrach 's stock in trade , refreshing themselves after an arduous stroke of business , Jamrach with something orthodox , Barnum with something heterodox -- for Barnum was a teetotaler .
Parsing [sent. 8240 len. 10]: The stroke of business was in the elephant line .
Parsing [sent. 8241 len. 24]: Jamrach had contracted to deliver to Barnum in New York 18 elephants for $ 360,000 in time for the next season 's opening .
Parsing [sent. 8242 len. 14]: Then it occurred to Mr. Barnum that he needed a `` card . ''
Parsing [sent. 8243 len. 4]: He suggested Jumbo .
Parsing [sent. 8244 len. 26]: Jamrach said he would have to think of something else -- Jumbo could n't be had ; the Zoo would n't part with that elephant .
Parsing [sent. 8245 len. 17]: Barnum said he was willing to pay a fortune for Jumbo if he could get him .
Parsing [sent. 8246 len. 65]: Jamrach said it was no use to think about it ; that Jumbo was as popular as the Prince of Wales and the Zoo would n't dare to sell him ; all England would be outraged at the idea ; Jumbo was an English institution ; he was part of the national glory ; one might as well think of buying the Nelson monument .
Parsing [sent. 8247 len. 15]: Barnum spoke up with vivacity and said : `` It 's a first-rate idea .
Parsing [sent. 8248 len. 7]: I 'll buy the Monument . ''
Parsing [sent. 8249 len. 7]: Jamrach was speechless for a second .
Parsing [sent. 8250 len. 12]: Then he said , like one ashamed `` You caught me .
Parsing [sent. 8251 len. 4]: I was napping .
Parsing [sent. 8252 len. 11]: For a moment I thought you were in earnest . ''
Parsing [sent. 8253 len. 10]: Barnum said pleasantly -- `` I was in earnest .
Parsing [sent. 8254 len. 24]: I know they wo n't sell it , but no matter , I will not throw away a good idea for all that .
Parsing [sent. 8255 len. 8]: All I want is a big advertisement .
Parsing [sent. 8256 len. 21]: I will keep the thing in mind , and if nothing better turns up I will offer to buy it .
Parsing [sent. 8257 len. 6]: That will answer every purpose .
Parsing [sent. 8258 len. 39]: It will furnish me a couple of columns of gratis advertising in every English and American paper for a couple of months , and give my show the biggest boom a show ever had in this world . ''
Parsing [sent. 8259 len. 26]: Jamrach started to deliver a burst of admiration , but was interrupted by Barnum , who said : `` Here is a state of things !
Parsing [sent. 8260 len. 6]: England ought to blush . ''
Parsing [sent. 8261 len. 10]: His eye had fallen upon something in the newspaper .
Parsing [sent. 8262 len. 12]: He read it through to himself , then read it aloud .
Parsing [sent. 8263 len. 74]: It said that the house that Shakespeare was born in at Stratford-on-Avon was falling gradually to ruin through neglect ; that the room where the poet first saw the light was now serving as a butcher 's shop ; that all appeals to England to contribute money -LRB- the requisite sum stated -RRB- to buy and repair the house and place it in the care of salaried and trustworthy keepers had fallen resultless .
Parsing [sent. 8264 len. 10]: Then Barnum said : `` There 's my chance .
Parsing [sent. 8265 len. 14]: Let Jumbo and the Monument alone for the present -- they 'll keep .
Parsing [sent. 8266 len. 7]: I 'll buy Shakespeare 's house .
Parsing [sent. 8267 len. 58]: I 'll set it up in my Museum in New York and put a glass case around it and make a sacred thing of it ; and you 'll see all America flock there to worship ; yes , and pilgrims from the whole earth ; and I 'll make them take their hats off , too .
Parsing [sent. 8268 len. 16]: In America we know how to value anything that Shakespeare 's touch has made holy .
Parsing [sent. 8269 len. 5]: You 'll see . ''
Parsing [sent. 8270 len. 18]: In conclusion the S. C. P. said : `` That is the way the thing came about .
Parsing [sent. 8271 len. 7]: Barnum did buy Shakespeare 's house .
Parsing [sent. 8272 len. 15]: He paid the price asked , and received the properly attested documents of sale .
Parsing [sent. 8273 len. 11]: Then there was an explosion , I can tell you .
Parsing [sent. 8274 len. 3]: England rose !
Parsing [sent. 8275 len. 56]: What , the birthplace of the master-genius of all the ages and all the climes -- that priceless possession of Britain -- to be carted out of the country like so much old lumber and set up for sixpenny desecration in a Yankee show-shop -- the idea was not to be tolerated for a moment .
Parsing [sent. 8276 len. 18]: England rose in her indignation ; and Barnum was glad to relinquish his prize and offer apologies .
Parsing [sent. 8277 len. 21]: However , he stood out for a compromise ; he claimed a concession -- England must let him have Jumbo .
Parsing [sent. 8278 len. 9]: And England consented , but not cheerfully . ''
Parsing [sent. 8279 len. 28]: It shows how , by help of time , a story can grow -- even after Barnum has had the first innings in the telling of it .
Parsing [sent. 8280 len. 11]: Mr. Barnum told me the story himself , years ago .
Parsing [sent. 8281 len. 29]: He said that the permission to buy Jumbo was not a concession ; the purchase was made and the animal delivered before the public knew anything about it .
Parsing [sent. 8282 len. 14]: Also , that the securing of Jumbo was all the advertisement he needed .
Parsing [sent. 8283 len. 17]: It produced many columns of newspaper talk , free of cost , and he was satisfied .
Parsing [sent. 8284 len. 93]: He said that if he had failed to get Jumbo he would have caused his notion of buying the Nelson Monument to be treacherously smuggled into print by some trusty friend , and after he had gotten a few hundred pages of gratuitous advertising out of it , he would have come out with a blundering , obtuse , but warm-hearted letter of apology , and in a postscript to it would have naively proposed to let the Monument go , and take Stonehenge in place of it at the same price .
Parsing [sent. 8285 len. 42]: It was his opinion that such a letter , written with well-simulated asinine innocence and gush would have gotten his ignorance and stupidity an amount of newspaper abuse worth six fortunes to him , and not purchasable for twice the money .
Parsing [sent. 8286 len. 24]: I knew Mr. Barnum well , and I placed every confidence in the account which he gave me of the Shakespeare birthplace episode .
Parsing [sent. 8287 len. 42]: He said he found the house neglected and going-to decay , and he inquired into the matter and was told that many times earnest efforts had been made to raise money for its proper repair and preservation , but without success .
Parsing [sent. 8288 len. 7]: He then proposed to buy it .
Parsing [sent. 8289 len. 39]: The proposition was entertained , and a price named -- $ 50,000 , I think ; but whatever it was , Barnum paid the money down , without remark , and the papers were drawn up and executed .
Parsing [sent. 8290 len. 48]: He said that it had been his purpose to set up the house in his Museum , keep it in repair , protect it from name-scribblers and other desecrators , and leave it by bequest to the safe and perpetual guardianship of the Smithsonian Institute at Washington .
Parsing [sent. 8291 len. 60]: But as soon as it was found that Shakespeare 's house had passed into foreign hands and was going to be carried across the ocean , England was stirred as no appeal from the custodians of the relic had ever stirred England before , and protests came flowing in -- and money , too , to stop the outrage .
Parsing [sent. 8292 len. 20]: Offers of repurchase were made -- offers of double the money that Mr. Barnum had paid for the house .
Parsing [sent. 8293 len. 39]: He handed the house back , but took only the sum which it had cost him -- but on the condition that an endowment sufficient for the future safeguarding and maintenance of the sacred relic should be raised .
Parsing [sent. 8294 len. 5]: This condition was fulfilled .
Parsing [sent. 8295 len. 41]: That was Barnum 's account of the episode ; and to the end of his days he claimed with pride and satisfaction that not England , but America -- represented by him -- saved the birthplace of Shakespeare from destruction .
Parsing [sent. 8296 len. 33]: At 3 P.M. , May 6th , the ship slowed down , off the land , and thoughtfully and cautiously picked her way into the snug harbor of Durban , South Africa .
Parsing [sent. 8297 len. 3]: CHAPTER LXV .
Parsing [sent. 8298 len. 13]: In statesmanship get the formalities right , never mind about the moralities .
Parsing [sent. 8299 len. 9]: -- Pudd ` nhead Wilson 's New Calendar .
Parsing [sent. 8300 len. 6]: FROM DIARY : Royal Hotel .
Parsing [sent. 8301 len. 12]: Comfortable , good table , good service of natives and Madrasis .
Parsing [sent. 8302 len. 16]: Curious jumble of modern and ancient city and village , primitiveness and the other thing .
Parsing [sent. 8303 len. 9]: Electric bells , but they do n't ring .
Parsing [sent. 8304 len. 37]: Asked why they did n't , the watchman in the office said he thought they must be out of order ; he thought so because some of them rang , but most of them did n't .
Parsing [sent. 8305 len. 13]: Would n't it be a good idea to put them in order ?
Parsing [sent. 8306 len. 16]: He hesitated -- like one who is n't quite sure -- then conceded the point .
Parsing [sent. 8307 len. 3]: May 7 .
Parsing [sent. 8308 len. 8]: A bang on the door at 6 .
Parsing [sent. 8309 len. 7]: Did I want my boots cleaned ?
Parsing [sent. 8310 len. 6]: Fifteen minutes later another bang .
Parsing [sent. 8311 len. 5]: Did we want coffee ?
Parsing [sent. 8312 len. 19]: Fifteen later , bang again , my wife 's bath ready ; 15 later , my bath ready .
Parsing [sent. 8313 len. 11]: Two other bangs ; I forget what they were about .
Parsing [sent. 8314 len. 18]: Then lots of shouting back and forth , among the servants just as in an Indian hotel .
Parsing [sent. 8315 len. 2]: Evening .
Parsing [sent. 8316 len. 8]: At 4 P.M. it was unpleasantly warm .
Parsing [sent. 8317 len. 15]: Half-hour after sunset one needed a spring overcoat ; by 8 a winter one .
Parsing [sent. 8318 len. 8]: Durban is a neat and clean town .
Parsing [sent. 8319 len. 11]: One notices that without having his attention called to it .
Parsing [sent. 8320 len. 33]: Rickshaws drawn by splendidly built black Zulus , so overflowing with strength , seemingly , that it is a pleasure , not a pain , to see them snatch a rickshaw along .
Parsing [sent. 8321 len. 13]: They smile and laugh and show their teeth -- a good-natured lot .
Parsing [sent. 8322 len. 24]: Not allowed to drink ; 2s per hour for one person ; 3s for two ; 3d for a course -- one person .
Parsing [sent. 8323 len. 7]: The chameleon in the hotel court .
Parsing [sent. 8324 len. 31]: He is fat and indolent and contemplative ; but is business-like and capable when a fly comes about -- reaches out a tongue like a teaspoon and takes him in .
Parsing [sent. 8325 len. 6]: He gums his tongue first .
Parsing [sent. 8326 len. 9]: He is always pious , in his looks .
Parsing [sent. 8327 len. 17]: And pious and thankful both , when Providence or one of us sends him a fly .
Parsing [sent. 8328 len. 29]: He has a froggy head , and a back like a new grave -- for shape ; and hands like a bird 's toes that have been frostbitten .
Parsing [sent. 8329 len. 8]: But his eyes are his exhibition feature .
Parsing [sent. 8330 len. 54]: A couple of skinny cones project from the sides of his head , with a wee shiny bead of an eye set in the apex of each ; and these cones turn bodily like pivot-guns and point every-which-way , and they are independent of each other ; each has its own exclusive machinery .
Parsing [sent. 8331 len. 77]: When I am behind him and C. in front of him , he whirls one eye rearwards and the other forwards -- which gives him a most Congressional expression -LRB- one eye on the constituency and one on the swag -RRB- ; and then if something happens above and below him he shoots out one eye upward like a telescope and the other downward -- and this changes his expression , but does not improve it .
Parsing [sent. 8332 len. 13]: Natives must not be out after the curfew bell without a pass .
Parsing [sent. 8333 len. 10]: In Natal there are ten blacks to one white .
Parsing [sent. 8334 len. 7]: Sturdy plump creatures are the women .
Parsing [sent. 8335 len. 37]: They comb their wool up to a peak and keep it in position by stiffening it with brown-red clay -- half of this tower colored , denotes engagement ; the whole of it colored denotes marriage .
Parsing [sent. 8336 len. 13]: None but heathen Zulus on the police ; Christian ones not allowed .
Parsing [sent. 8337 len. 3]: May 9 .
Parsing [sent. 8338 len. 9]: A drive yesterday with friends over the Berea .
Parsing [sent. 8339 len. 19]: Very fine roads and lofty , overlooking the whole town , the harbor , and the sea-beautiful views .
Parsing [sent. 8340 len. 40]: Residences all along , set in the midst of green lawns with shrubs and generally one or two intensely red outbursts of poinsettia -- the flaming splotch of blinding red a stunning contrast with the world of surrounding green .
Parsing [sent. 8341 len. 14]: The cactus tree -- candelabrum-like ; and one twisted like gray writhing serpents .
Parsing [sent. 8342 len. 59]: The `` flat-crown '' -LRB- should be flat-roof -RRB- -- half a dozen naked branches full of elbows , slant upward like artificial supports , and fling a roof of delicate foliage out in a horizontal platform as flat as a floor ; and you look up through this thin floor as through a green cobweb or veil .
Parsing [sent. 8343 len. 5]: The branches are japanesich .
Parsing [sent. 8344 len. 40]: All about you is a bewildering variety of unfamiliar and beautiful trees ; one sort wonderfully dense foliage and very dark green -- so dark that you notice it at once , notwithstanding there are so many orange trees .
Parsing [sent. 8345 len. 25]: The `` flamboyant '' -- not in flower , now , but when in flower lives up to its name , we are told .
Parsing [sent. 8346 len. 20]: Another tree with a lovely upright tassel scattered among its rich greenery , red and glowing as a firecoal .
Parsing [sent. 8347 len. 19]: Here and there a gum-tree ; half a dozen lofty Norfolk Island pines lifting their fronded arms skyward .
Parsing [sent. 8348 len. 5]: Groups of tall bamboo .
Parsing [sent. 8349 len. 4]: Saw one bird .
Parsing [sent. 8350 len. 23]: Not many birds here , and they have no music -- and the flowers not much smell , they grow so fast .
Parsing [sent. 8351 len. 10]: Everything neat and trim and clean like the town .
Parsing [sent. 8352 len. 17]: The loveliest trees and the greatest variety I have ever seen anywhere , except approaching Darjeeling .
Parsing [sent. 8353 len. 20]: Have not heard anyone call Natal the garden of South Africa , but that is what it probably is .
Parsing [sent. 8354 len. 17]: It was when Bishop of Natal that Colenso raised such a storm in the religious world .
Parsing [sent. 8355 len. 11]: The concerns of religion are a vital matter here yet .
Parsing [sent. 8356 len. 8]: A vigilant eye is kept upon Sunday .
Parsing [sent. 8357 len. 12]: Museums and other dangerous resorts are not allowed to be open .
Parsing [sent. 8358 len. 15]: You may sail on the Bay , but it is wicked to play cricket .
Parsing [sent. 8359 len. 24]: For a while a Sunday concert was tolerated , upon condition that it must be admission free and the money taken by collection .
Parsing [sent. 8360 len. 12]: But the collection was alarmingly large and that stopped the matter .
Parsing [sent. 8361 len. 6]: They are particular about babies .
Parsing [sent. 8362 len. 19]: A clergyman would not bury a child according to the sacred rites because it had not been baptized .
Parsing [sent. 8363 len. 6]: The Hindoo is more liberal .
Parsing [sent. 8364 len. 15]: He burns no child under three , holding that it does not need purifying .
Parsing [sent. 8365 len. 24]: The King of the Zulus , a fine fellow of 30 , was banished six years ago for a term of seven years .
Parsing [sent. 8366 len. 11]: He is occupying Napoleon 's old stand -- St. Helena .
Parsing [sent. 8367 len. 35]: The people are a little nervous about having him come back , and they may well be , for Zulu kings have been terrible people sometimes -- like Tchaka , Dingaan , and Cetewayo .
Parsing [sent. 8368 len. 48]: There is a large Trappist monastery two hours from Durban , over the country roads , and in company with Mr. Milligan and Mr. Hunter , general manager of the Natal government railways , who knew the heads of it , we went out to see it .
Parsing [sent. 8369 len. 76]: There it all was , just as one reads about it in books and can not believe that it is so -- I mean the rough , hard work , the impossible hours , the scanty food , the coarse raiment , the Maryborough beds , the tabu of human speech , of social intercourse , of relaxation , of amusement , of entertainment , of the presence of woman in the men 's establishment .
Parsing [sent. 8370 len. 5]: There it all was .
Parsing [sent. 8371 len. 12]: It was not a dream , it was not a lie .
Parsing [sent. 8372 len. 14]: And yet with the fact before one 's face it was still incredible .
Parsing [sent. 8373 len. 20]: It is such a sweeping suppression of human instincts , such an extinction of the man as an individual .
Parsing [sent. 8374 len. 10]: La Trappe must have known the human race well .
Parsing [sent. 8375 len. 21]: The scheme which he invented hunts out everything that a man wants and values -- and withholds it from him .
Parsing [sent. 8376 len. 27]: Apparently there is no detail that can help make life worth living that has not been carefully ascertained and placed out of the Trappist 's reach .
Parsing [sent. 8377 len. 25]: La Trappe must have known that there were men who would enjoy this kind of misery , but how did he find it out ?
Parsing [sent. 8378 len. 32]: If he had consulted you or me he would have been told that his scheme lacked too many attractions ; that it was impossible ; that it could never be floated .
Parsing [sent. 8379 len. 19]: But there in the monastery was proof that he knew the human race better than it knew itself .
Parsing [sent. 8380 len. 37]: He set his foot upon every desire that a man has -- yet he floated his project , and it has prospered for two hundred years , and will go on prospering forever , no doubt .
Parsing [sent. 8381 len. 13]: Man likes personal distinction -- there in the monastery it is obliterated .
Parsing [sent. 8382 len. 20]: He likes delicious food -- there he gets beans and bread and tea , and not enough of it .
Parsing [sent. 8383 len. 26]: He likes to lie softly -- there he lies on a sand mattress , and has a pillow and a blanket , but no sheet .
Parsing [sent. 8384 len. 36]: When he is dining , in a great company of friends , he likes to laugh and chat -- there a monk reads a holy book aloud during meals , and nobody speaks or laughs .
Parsing [sent. 8385 len. 66]: When a man has a hundred friends about him , evenings , he likes to have a good time and run late -- there he and the rest go silently to bed at 8 ; and in the dark , too ; there is but a loose brown robe to discard , there are no night-clothes to put on , a light is not needed .
Parsing [sent. 8386 len. 36]: Man likes to lie abed late -- there he gets up once or twice in the night to perform some religious office , and gets up finally for the day at two in the morning .
Parsing [sent. 8387 len. 45]: Man likes light work or none at all -- there he labors all day in the field , or in the blacksmith shop or the other shops devoted to the mechanical trades , such as shoemaking , saddlery , carpentry , and so on .
Parsing [sent. 8388 len. 15]: Man likes the society of girls and women -- there he never has it .
Parsing [sent. 8389 len. 22]: He likes to have his children about him , and pet them and play with them -- there he has none .
Parsing [sent. 8390 len. 10]: He likes billiards -- there is no table there .
Parsing [sent. 8391 len. 18]: He likes outdoor sports and indoor dramatic and musical and social entertainments -- there are none there .
Parsing [sent. 8392 len. 16]: He likes to bet on things -- I was told that betting is forbidden there .
Parsing [sent. 8393 len. 21]: When a man 's temper is up he likes to pour it out upon somebody there this is not allowed .
Parsing [sent. 8394 len. 12]: A man likes animals -- pets ; there are none there .
Parsing [sent. 8395 len. 12]: He likes to smoke -- there he can not do it .
Parsing [sent. 8396 len. 14]: He likes to read the news -- no papers or magazines come there .
Parsing [sent. 8397 len. 32]: A man likes to know how his parents and brothers and sisters are getting along when he is away , and if they miss him -- there he can not know .
Parsing [sent. 8398 len. 30]: A man likes a pretty house , and pretty furniture , and pretty things , and pretty colors -- there he has nothing but naked aridity and sombre colors .
Parsing [sent. 8399 len. 19]: A man likes -- name it yourself : whatever it is , it is absent from that place .
Parsing [sent. 8400 len. 21]: From what I could learn , all that a man gets for this is merely the saving of his soul .
Parsing [sent. 8401 len. 9]: It all seems strange , incredible , impossible .
Parsing [sent. 8402 len. 7]: But La Trappe knew the race .
Parsing [sent. 8403 len. 30]: He knew the powerful attraction of unattractiveness ; he knew that no life could be imagined , howsoever comfortless and forbidding , but somebody would want to try it .
Parsing [sent. 8404 len. 74]: This parent establishment of Germans began its work fifteen years ago , strangers , poor , and unencouraged ; it owns 15,000 acres of land now , and raises grain and fruit , and makes wines , and manufactures all manner of things , and has native apprentices in its shops , and sends them forth able to read and write , and also well equipped to earn their living by their trades .
Parsing [sent. 8405 len. 32]: And this young establishment has set up eleven branches in South Africa , and in them they are christianizing and educating and teaching wage-yielding mechanical trades to 1,200 boys and girls .
Parsing [sent. 8406 len. 74]: Protestant Missionary work is coldly regarded by the commercial white colonist all over the heathen world , as a rule , and its product is nicknamed `` rice-Christians '' -LRB- occupationless incapables who join the church for revenue only -RRB- , but I think it would be difficult to pick a flaw in the work of these Catholic monks , and I believe that the disposition to attempt it has not shown itself .
Parsing [sent. 8407 len. 5]: Tuesday , May 12 .
Parsing [sent. 8408 len. 7]: Transvaal politics in a confused condition .
Parsing [sent. 8409 len. 83]: First the sentencing of the Johannesburg Reformers startled England by its severity ; on the top of this came Kruger 's exposure of the cipher correspondence , which showed that the invasion of the Transvaal , with the design of seizing that country and adding it to the British Empire , was planned by Cecil Rhodes and Beit -- which made a revulsion in English feeling , and brought out a storm against Rhodes and the Chartered Company for degrading British honor .
Parsing [sent. 8410 len. 22]: For a good while I could n't seem to get at a clear comprehension of it , it was so tangled .
Parsing [sent. 8411 len. 14]: But at last by patient study I have managed it , I believe .
Parsing [sent. 8412 len. 31]: As I understand it , the Uitlanders and other Dutchmen were dissatisfied because the English would not allow them to take any part in the government except to pay taxes .
Parsing [sent. 8413 len. 72]: Next , as I understand it , Dr. Kruger and Dr. Jameson , not having been able to make the medical business pay , made a raid into Matabeleland with the intention of capturing the capital , Johannesburg , and holding the women and children to ransom until the Uitlanders and the other Boers should grant to them and the Chartered Company the political rights which had been withheld from them .
Parsing [sent. 8414 len. 46]: They would have succeeded in this great scheme , as I understand it , but for the interference of Cecil Rhodes and Mr. Beit , and other Chiefs of the Matabele , who persuaded their countrymen to revolt and throw off their allegiance to Germany .
Parsing [sent. 8415 len. 39]: This , in turn , as I understand it , provoked the King of Abyssinia to destroy the Italian army and fall back upon Johannesburg ; this at the instigation of Rhodes , to bull the stock market .
Parsing [sent. 8416 len. 3]: CHAPTER LXVI .
Parsing [sent. 8417 len. 18]: Every one is a moon , and has a dark side which he never shows to anybody .

Parsing [sent. 8419 len. 61]: When I scribbled in my note-book a year ago the paragraph which ends the preceding chapter , it was meant to indicate , in an extravagant form , two things : the conflicting nature of the information conveyed by the citizen to the stranger concerning South African politics , and the resulting confusion created in the stranger 's mind thereby .
Parsing [sent. 8420 len. 10]: But it does not seem so very extravagant now .
Parsing [sent. 8421 len. 59]: Nothing could in that disturbed and excited time make South African politics clear or quite rational to the citizen of the country because his personal interest and his political prejudices were in his way ; and nothing could make those politics clear or rational to the stranger , the sources of his information being such as they were .
Parsing [sent. 8422 len. 9]: I was in South Africa some little time .
Parsing [sent. 8423 len. 11]: When I arrived there the political pot was boiling fiercely .
Parsing [sent. 8424 len. 127]: Four months previously , Jameson had plunged over the Transvaal border with about 600 armed horsemen at his back , to go to the `` relief of the women and children '' of Johannesburg ; on the fourth day of his march the Boers had defeated him in battle , and carried him and his men to Pretoria , the capital , as prisoners ; the Boer government had turned Jameson and his officers over to the British government for trial , and shipped them to England ; next , it had arrested 64 important citizens of Johannesburg as raid-conspirators , condemned their four leaders to death , then commuted the sentences , and now the 64 were waiting , in jail , for further results .
Parsing [sent. 8425 len. 50]: Before midsummer they were all out excepting two , who refused to sign the petitions for release ; 58 had been fined $ 10,000 each and enlarged , and the four leaders had gotten off with fines of $ 125,000 each with permanent exile added , in one case .
Parsing [sent. 8426 len. 22]: Those were wonderfully interesting days for a stranger , and I was glad to be in the thick of the excitement .
Parsing [sent. 8427 len. 22]: Everybody was talking , and I expected to understand the whole of one side of it in a very little while .
Parsing [sent. 8428 len. 4]: I was disappointed .
Parsing [sent. 8429 len. 17]: There were singularities , perplexities , unaccountabilities about it which I was not able to master .
Parsing [sent. 8430 len. 30]: I had no personal access to Boers -- their side was a secret to me , aside from what I was able to gather of it from published statements .
Parsing [sent. 8431 len. 21]: My sympathies were soon with the Reformers in the Pretoria jail , with their friends , and with their cause .
Parsing [sent. 8432 len. 33]: By diligent inquiry in Johannesburg I found out -- apparently -- all the details of their side of the quarrel except one -- what they expected to accomplish by an armed rising .
Parsing [sent. 8433 len. 5]: Nobody seemed to know .
Parsing [sent. 8434 len. 17]: The reason why the Reformers were discontented and wanted some changes made , seemed quite clear .
Parsing [sent. 8435 len. 28]: In Johannesburg it was claimed that the Uitlanders -LRB- strangers , foreigners -RRB- paid thirteen-fifteenths of the Transvaal taxes , yet got little or nothing for it .
Parsing [sent. 8436 len. 30]: Their city had no charter ; it had no municipal government ; it could levy no taxes for drainage , water-supply , paving , cleaning , sanitation , policing .
Parsing [sent. 8437 len. 30]: There was a police force , but it was composed of Boers , it was furnished by the State Government , and the city had no control over it .
Parsing [sent. 8438 len. 39]: Mining was very costly ; the government enormously increased the cost by putting burdensome taxes upon the mines , the output , the machinery , the buildings ; by burdensome imposts upon incoming materials ; by burdensome railway-freight-charges .
Parsing [sent. 8439 len. 28]: Hardest of all to bear , the government reserved to itself a monopoly in that essential thing , dynamite , and burdened it with an extravagant price .
Parsing [sent. 8440 len. 13]: The detested Hollander from over the water held all the public offices .
Parsing [sent. 8441 len. 7]: The government was rank with corruption .
Parsing [sent. 8442 len. 22]: The Uitlander had no vote , and must live in the State ten or twelve years before he could get one .
Parsing [sent. 8443 len. 17]: He was not represented in the Raad -LRB- legislature -RRB- that oppressed him and fleeced him .
Parsing [sent. 8444 len. 5]: Religion was not free .
Parsing [sent. 8445 len. 28]: There were no schools where the teaching was in English , yet the great majority of the white population of the State knew no tongue but that .
Parsing [sent. 8446 len. 30]: The State would not pass a liquor law ; but allowed a great trade in cheap vile brandy among the blacks , with the result that 25 per cent .
Parsing [sent. 8447 len. 16]: of the 50,000 blacks employed in the mines were usually drunk and incapable of working .
Parsing [sent. 8448 len. 29]: There -- it was plain enough that the reasons for wanting some changes made were abundant and reasonable , if this statement of the existing grievances was correct .
Parsing [sent. 8449 len. 12]: What the Uitlanders wanted was reform -- under the existing Republic .
Parsing [sent. 8450 len. 19]: What they proposed to do was to secure these reforms by , prayer , petition , and persuasion .
Parsing [sent. 8451 len. 4]: They did petition .
Parsing [sent. 8452 len. 31]: Also , they issued a Manifesto , whose very first note is a bugle-blast of loyalty : `` We want the establishment of this Republic as a true Republic . ''
Parsing [sent. 8453 len. 20]: Could anything be clearer than the Uitlander 's statement of the grievances and oppressions under which they were suffering ?
Parsing [sent. 8454 len. 18]: Could anything be more legal and citizen-like and law-respecting than their attitude as expressed by their Manifesto ?
Parsing [sent. 8455 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 8456 len. 9]: Those things were perfectly clear , perfectly comprehensible .
Parsing [sent. 8457 len. 15]: But at this point the puzzles and riddles and confusions begin to flock in .
Parsing [sent. 8458 len. 13]: You have arrived at a place which you can not quite understand .
Parsing [sent. 8459 len. 71]: For you find that as a preparation for this loyal , lawful , and in every way unexceptionable attempt to persuade the government to right their grievances , the Uitlanders had smuggled a Maxim gun or two and 1,500 muskets into the town , concealed in oil tanks and coal cars , and had begun to form and drill military companies composed of clerks , merchants , and citizens generally .
Parsing [sent. 8460 len. 5]: What was their idea ?
Parsing [sent. 8461 len. 15]: Did they suppose that the Boers would attack them for petitioning , for redress ?
Parsing [sent. 8462 len. 5]: That could not be .
Parsing [sent. 8463 len. 21]: Did they suppose that the Boers would attack them even for issuing a Manifesto demanding relief under the existing government ?
Parsing [sent. 8464 len. 28]: Yes , they apparently believed so , because the air was full of talk of forcing the government to grant redress if it were not granted peacefully .
Parsing [sent. 8465 len. 8]: The Reformers were men of high intelligence .
Parsing [sent. 8466 len. 12]: If they were in earnest , they were taking extraordinary risks .
Parsing [sent. 8467 len. 31]: They had enormously valuable properties to defend ; their town was full of women and children ; their mines and compounds were packed with thousands upon thousands of sturdy blacks .
Parsing [sent. 8468 len. 63]: If the Boers attacked , the mines would close , the blacks would swarm out and get drunk ; riot and conflagration and the Boers together might lose the Reformers more in a day , in money , blood , and suffering , than the desired political relief could compensate in ten years if they won the fight and secured the reforms .
Parsing [sent. 8469 len. 29]: It is May , 1897 , now ; a year has gone by , and the confusions of that day have been to a considerable degree cleared away .
Parsing [sent. 8470 len. 45]: Mr. Cecil Rhodes , Dr. Jameson , and others responsible for the Raid , have testified before the Parliamentary Committee of Inquiry in London , and so have Mr. Lionel Phillips and other Johannesburg Reformers , monthly-nurses of the Revolution which was born dead .
Parsing [sent. 8471 len. 6]: These testimonies have thrown light .
Parsing [sent. 8472 len. 77]: Three books have added much to this light : `` South Africa As It Is , '' by Mr. Statham , an able writer partial to the Boers ; `` The Story of an African Crisis , '' by Mr. Garrett , a brilliant writer partial to Rhodes ; and `` A Woman 's Part in a Revolution , '' by Mrs. John Hays Hammond , a vigorous and vivid diarist , partial to the Reformers .
Parsing [sent. 8473 len. 49]: By liquifying the evidence of the prejudiced books and of the prejudiced parliamentary witnesses and stirring the whole together and pouring it into my own -LRB- prejudiced -RRB- moulds , I have got at the truth of that puzzling South African situation , which is this : 1 .
Parsing [sent. 8474 len. 46]: The capitalists and other chief men of Johannesburg were fretting under various political and financial burdens imposed by the State -LRB- the South African Republic , sometimes called `` the Transvaal '' -RRB- and desired to procure by peaceful means a modification of the laws .
Parsing [sent. 8475 len. 2]: 2 .
Parsing [sent. 8476 len. 90]: Mr. Cecil Rhodes , Premier of the British Cape Colony , millionaire , creator and managing director of the territorially-immense and financially unproductive South Africa Company ; projector of vast schemes for the unification and consolidation of all the South African States into one imposing commonwealth or empire under the shadow and general protection of the British flag , thought he saw an opportunity to make profitable use of the Uitlander discontent above mentioned -- make the Johannesburg cat help pull out one of his consolidation chestnuts for him .
Parsing [sent. 8477 len. 40]: With this view he set himself the task of warming the lawful and legitimate petitions and supplications of the Uitlanders into seditious talk , and their frettings into threatenings -- the final outcome to be revolt and armed rebellion .
Parsing [sent. 8478 len. 46]: If he could bring about a bloody collision between those people and the Boer government , Great Britain would have to interfere ; her interference would be resisted by the Boers ; she would chastise them and add the Transvaal to her South African possessions .
Parsing [sent. 8479 len. 14]: It was not a foolish idea , but a rational and practical one .
Parsing [sent. 8480 len. 48]: After a couple of years of judicious plotting , Mr. Rhodes had his reward ; the revolutionary kettle was briskly boiling in Johannesburg , and the Uitlander leaders were backing their appeals to the government -- now hardened into demands -- by threats of force and bloodshed .
Parsing [sent. 8481 len. 13]: By the middle of December , 1895 , the explosion seemed imminent .
Parsing [sent. 8482 len. 14]: Mr. Rhodes was diligently helping , from his distant post in Cape Town .
Parsing [sent. 8483 len. 32]: He was helping to procure arms for Johannesburg ; he was also arranging to have Jameson break over the border and come to Johannesburg with 600 mounted men at his back .
Parsing [sent. 8484 len. 24]: Jameson -- as per instructions from Rhodes , perhaps -- wanted a letter from the Reformers requesting him to come to their aid .
Parsing [sent. 8485 len. 6]: It was a good idea .
Parsing [sent. 8486 len. 16]: It would throw a considerable share of the responsibility of his invasion upon the Reformers .
Parsing [sent. 8487 len. 21]: He got the letter -- that famous one urging him to fly to the rescue of the women and children .
Parsing [sent. 8488 len. 9]: He got it two months before he flew .
Parsing [sent. 8489 len. 51]: The Reformers seem to have thought it over and concluded that they had not done wisely ; for the next day after giving Jameson the implicating document they wanted to withdraw it and leave the women and children in danger ; but they were told that it was too late .
Parsing [sent. 8490 len. 11]: The original had gone to Mr. Rhodes at the Cape .
Parsing [sent. 8491 len. 8]: Jameson had kept a copy , though .
Parsing [sent. 8492 len. 32]: From that time until the 29th of December , a good deal of the Reformers ' time was taken up with energetic efforts to keep Jameson from coming to their assistance .
Parsing [sent. 8493 len. 10]: Jameson 's invasion had been set for the 26th .
Parsing [sent. 8494 len. 6]: The Reformers were not ready .
Parsing [sent. 8495 len. 6]: The town was not united .
Parsing [sent. 8496 len. 66]: Some wanted a fight , some wanted peace ; some wanted a new government , some wanted the existing one reformed ; apparently very few wanted the revolution to take place in the interest and under the ultimate shelter of the Imperial flag -- British ; yet a report began to spread that Mr. Rhodes 's embarrassing assistance had for its end this latter object .
Parsing [sent. 8497 len. 19]: Jameson was away up on the frontier tugging at his leash , fretting to burst over the border .
Parsing [sent. 8498 len. 21]: By hard work the Reformers got his starting-date postponed a little , and wanted to get it postponed eleven days .
Parsing [sent. 8499 len. 23]: Apparently , Rhodes 's agents were seconding their efforts -- in fact wearing out the telegraph wires trying to hold him back .
Parsing [sent. 8500 len. 36]: Rhodes was himself the only man who could have effectively postponed Jameson , but that would have been a disadvantage to his scheme ; indeed , it could spoil his whole two years ' work .
Parsing [sent. 8501 len. 13]: Jameson endured postponement three days , then resolved to wait no longer .
Parsing [sent. 8502 len. 63]: Without any orders -- excepting Mr. Rhodes 's significant silence -- he cut the telegraph wires on the 29th , and made his plunge that night , to go to the rescue of the women and children , by urgent request of a letter now nine days old -- as per date , -- a couple of months old , in fact .
Parsing [sent. 8503 len. 13]: He read the letter to his men , and it affected them .
Parsing [sent. 8504 len. 9]: It did not affect all of them alike .
Parsing [sent. 8505 len. 38]: Some saw in it a piece of piracy of doubtful wisdom , and were sorry to find that they had been assembled to violate friendly territory instead of to raid native kraals , as they had supposed .
Parsing [sent. 8506 len. 8]: Jameson would have to ride 150 miles .
Parsing [sent. 8507 len. 29]: He knew that there were suspicions abroad in the Transvaal concerning him , but he expected to get through to Johannesburg before they should become general and obstructive .
Parsing [sent. 8508 len. 11]: But a telegraph wire had been overlooked and not cut .
Parsing [sent. 8509 len. 31]: It spread the news of his invasion far and wide , and a few hours after his start the Boer farmers were riding hard from every direction to intercept him .
Parsing [sent. 8510 len. 38]: As soon as it was known in Johannesburg that he was on his way to rescue the women and children , the grateful people put the women and children in a train and rushed them for Australia .
Parsing [sent. 8511 len. 31]: In fact , the approach of Johannesburg 's saviour created panic and consternation there , and a multitude of males of peaceable disposition swept to the trains like a sand-storm .
Parsing [sent. 8512 len. 26]: The early ones fared best ; they secured seats -- by sitting in them -- eight hours before the first train was timed to leave .
Parsing [sent. 8513 len. 6]: Mr. Rhodes lost no time .
Parsing [sent. 8514 len. 26]: He cabled the renowned Johannesburg letter of invitation to the London press -- the gray-headedest piece of ancient history that ever went over a cable .
Parsing [sent. 8515 len. 8]: The new poet laureate lost no time .
Parsing [sent. 8516 len. 43]: He came out with a rousing poem lauding Jameson 's prompt and splendid heroism in flying to the rescue of the women and children ; for the poet could not know that he did not fly until two months after the invitation .
Parsing [sent. 8517 len. 16]: He was deceived by the false date of the letter , which was December 20th .
Parsing [sent. 8518 len. 20]: Jameson was intercepted by the Boers on New Year 's Day , and on the next day he surrendered .
Parsing [sent. 8519 len. 40]: He had carried his copy of the letter along , and if his instructions required him -- in case of emergency -- to see that it fell into the hands of the Boers , he loyally carried them out .
Parsing [sent. 8520 len. 45]: Mrs. Hammond gives him a sharp rap for his supposed carelessness , and emphasizes her feeling about it with burning italics : `` It was picked up on the battle-field in a leathern pouch , supposed to be Dr. Jameson 's saddle - bag .
Parsing [sent. 8521 len. 20]: Why , in the name of all that is discreet and honorable , did n't he eat it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8522 len. 5]: She requires too much .
Parsing [sent. 8523 len. 22]: He was not in the service of the Reformers -- excepting ostensibly ; he was in the service of Mr. Rhodes .
Parsing [sent. 8524 len. 44]: It was the only plain English document , undarkened by ciphers and mysteries , and responsibly signed and authenticated , which squarely implicated the Reformers in the raid , and it was not to Mr. Rhodes 's interest that it should be eaten .
Parsing [sent. 8525 len. 15]: Besides , that letter was not the original , it was only a copy .
Parsing [sent. 8526 len. 12]: Mr. Rhodes had the original -- and did n't eat it .
Parsing [sent. 8527 len. 8]: He cabled it to the London press .
Parsing [sent. 8528 len. 21]: It had already been read in England and America and all over Europe before Jameson dropped it on the battlefield .
Parsing [sent. 8529 len. 21]: If the subordinate 's knuckles deserved a rap , the principal 's deserved as many as a couple of them .
Parsing [sent. 8530 len. 26]: That letter is a juicily dramatic incident and is entitled to all its celebrity , because of the odd and variegated effects which it produced .
Parsing [sent. 8531 len. 78]: All within the space of a single week it had made Jameson an illustrious hero in England , a pirate in Pretoria , and an ass without discretion or honor in Johannesburg ; also it had produced a poet-laureatic explosion of colored fireworks which filled the world 's sky with giddy splendors , and , the knowledge that Jameson was coming with it to rescue the women and children emptied Johannesburg of that detail of the population .
Parsing [sent. 8532 len. 9]: For an old letter , this was much .
Parsing [sent. 8533 len. 24]: For a letter two months old , it did marvels ; if it had been a year old it would have done miracles .
Parsing [sent. 8534 len. 3]: CHAPTER LXVII .
Parsing [sent. 8535 len. 9]: First catch your Boer , then kick him .
Parsing [sent. 8536 len. 9]: -- Pudd ` nhead Wilson 's New Calendar .
Parsing [sent. 8537 len. 15]: Those latter days were days of bitter worry and trouble for the harassed Reformers .
Parsing [sent. 8538 len. 31]: From Mrs. Hammond we learn that on the 31st -LRB- the day after Johannesburg heard of the invasion -RRB- , `` The Reform Committee repudiates Dr. Jameson 's inroad . ''
Parsing [sent. 8539 len. 11]: It also publishes its intention to adhere to the Manifesto .
Parsing [sent. 8540 len. 17]: It also earnestly desires that the inhabitants shall refrain from overt acts against the Boer government .
Parsing [sent. 8541 len. 21]: It also `` distributes arms '' at the Court House , and furnishes horses `` to the newly-enrolled volunteers . ''
Parsing [sent. 8542 len. 27]: It also brings a Transvaal flag into the committee-room , and the entire body swear allegiance to it `` with uncovered heads and upraised arms . ''
Parsing [sent. 8543 len. 15]: Also `` one thousand Lee-Metford rifles have been given out '' -- to rebels .
Parsing [sent. 8544 len. 42]: Also , in a speech , Reformer Lionel Phillips informs the public that the Reform Committee Delegation has `` been received with courtesy by the Government Commission , '' and `` been assured that their proposals shall be earnestly considered . ''
Parsing [sent. 8545 len. 19]: That `` while the Reform Committee regretted Jameson 's precipitate action , they would stand by him . ''
Parsing [sent. 8546 len. 37]: Also the populace are in a state of `` wild enthusiasm , '' and `` can scarcely be restrained ; they want to go out to meet Jameson and bring him in with triumphal outcry . ''
Parsing [sent. 8547 len. 20]: Also the British High Commissioner has issued a damnifying proclamation against Jameson and all British abettors of his game .
Parsing [sent. 8548 len. 5]: It arrives January 1st .
Parsing [sent. 8549 len. 16]: It is a difficult position for the Reformers , and full of hindrances and perplexities .
Parsing [sent. 8550 len. 10]: Their duty is hard , but plain : 1 .
Parsing [sent. 8551 len. 13]: They have to repudiate the inroad , and stand by the inroader .
Parsing [sent. 8552 len. 2]: 2 .
Parsing [sent. 8553 len. 18]: They have to swear allegiance to the Boer government , and distribute cavalry horses to the rebels .
Parsing [sent. 8554 len. 2]: 3 .
Parsing [sent. 8555 len. 18]: They have to forbid overt acts against the Boer government , and distribute arms to its enemies .
Parsing [sent. 8556 len. 2]: 4 .
Parsing [sent. 8557 len. 36]: They have to avoid collision with the British government , but still stand by Jameson and their new oath of allegiance to the Boer government , taken , uncovered , in presence of its flag .
Parsing [sent. 8558 len. 33]: They did such of these things as they could ; they tried to do them all ; in fact , did do them all , but only in turn , not simultaneously .
Parsing [sent. 8559 len. 13]: In the nature of things they could not be made to simultane .
Parsing [sent. 8560 len. 23]: In preparing for armed revolution and in talking revolution , were the Reformers `` bluffing , '' or were they in earnest ?
Parsing [sent. 8561 len. 19]: If they were in earnest , they were taking great risks -- as has been already pointed out .
Parsing [sent. 8562 len. 33]: A gentleman of high position told me in Johannesburg that he had in his possession a printed document proclaiming a new government and naming its president -- one of the Reform leaders .
Parsing [sent. 8563 len. 19]: He said that this proclamation had been ready for issue , but was suppressed when the raid collapsed .
Parsing [sent. 8564 len. 5]: Perhaps I misunderstood him .
Parsing [sent. 8565 len. 22]: Indeed , I must have misunderstood him , for I have not seen mention of this large incident in print anywhere .
Parsing [sent. 8566 len. 41]: Besides , I hope I am mistaken ; for , if I am , then there is argument that the Reformers were privately not serious , but were only trying to scare the Boer government into granting the desired reforms .
Parsing [sent. 8567 len. 14]: The Boer government was scared , and it had a right to be .
Parsing [sent. 8568 len. 25]: For if Mr. Rhodes 's plan was to provoke a collision that would compel the interference of England , that was a serious matter .
Parsing [sent. 8569 len. 49]: If it could be shown that that was also the Reformers ' plan and purpose , it would prove that they had marked out a feasible project , at any rate , although it was one which could hardly fail to cost them ruinously before England should arrive .
Parsing [sent. 8570 len. 13]: But it seems clear that they had no such plan nor desire .
Parsing [sent. 8571 len. 30]: If , when the worst should come to the worst , they meant to overthrow the government , they also meant to inherit the assets themselves , no doubt .
Parsing [sent. 8572 len. 7]: This scheme could hardly have succeeded .
Parsing [sent. 8573 len. 35]: With an army of Boers at their gates and 50,000 riotous blacks in their midst , the odds against success would have been too heavy -- even if the whole town had been armed .
Parsing [sent. 8574 len. 14]: With only 2,500 rifles in the place , they stood really no chance .
Parsing [sent. 8575 len. 30]: To me , the military problems of the situation are of more interest than the political ones , because by disposition I have always been especially fond of war .
Parsing [sent. 8576 len. 16]: No , I mean fond of discussing war ; and fond of giving military advice .
Parsing [sent. 8577 len. 21]: If I had been with Jameson the morning after he started , I should have advised him to turn back .
Parsing [sent. 8578 len. 27]: That was Monday ; it was then that he received his first warning from a Boer source not to violate the friendly soil of the Transvaal .
Parsing [sent. 8579 len. 8]: It showed that his invasion was known .
Parsing [sent. 8580 len. 25]: If I had been with him on Tuesday morning and afternoon , when he received further warnings , I should have repeated my advice .
Parsing [sent. 8581 len. 47]: If I had been with him the next morning -- New Year 's -- when he received notice that `` a few hundred '' Boers were waiting for him a few miles ahead , I should not have advised , but commanded him to go back .
Parsing [sent. 8582 len. 55]: And if I had been with him two or three hours later -- a thing not conceivable to me -- I should have retired him by force ; for at that time he learned that the few hundred had now grown to 800 ; and that meant that the growing would go on growing .
Parsing [sent. 8583 len. 114]: For , by authority of Mr. Garrett , one knows that Jameson 's 600 were only 530 at most , when you count out his native drivers , etc. ; and that the 530 consisted largely of `` green '' youths , `` raw young fellows , '' not trained and war-worn British soldiers ; and I would have told Jameson that those lads would not be able to shoot effectively from horseback in the scamper and racket of battle , and that there would not be anything for them to shoot at , anyway , but rocks ; for the Boers would be behind the rocks , not out in the open .
Parsing [sent. 8584 len. 24]: I would have told him that 300 Boer sharpshooters behind rocks would be an overmatch for his 500 raw young fellows on horseback .
Parsing [sent. 8585 len. 17]: If pluck were the only thing essential to battle-winning , the English would lose no battles .
Parsing [sent. 8586 len. 18]: But discretion , as well as pluck , is required when one fights Boers and Red Indians .
Parsing [sent. 8587 len. 33]: In South Africa the Briton has always insisted upon standing bravely up , unsheltered , before the hidden Boer , and taking the results : Jameson 's men would follow the custom .
Parsing [sent. 8588 len. 21]: Jameson would not have listened to me -- he would have been intent upon repeating history , according to precedent .
Parsing [sent. 8589 len. 30]: Americans are not acquainted with the British-Boer war of 1881 ; but its history is interesting , and could have been instructive to Jameson if he had been receptive .
Parsing [sent. 8590 len. 18]: I will cull some details of it from trustworthy sources mainly from `` Russell 's Natal . ''
Parsing [sent. 8591 len. 11]: Mr. Russell is not a Boer , but a Briton .
Parsing [sent. 8592 len. 23]: He is inspector of schools , and his history is a text-book whose purpose is the instruction of the Natal English youth .
Parsing [sent. 8593 len. 42]: After the seizure of the Transvaal and the suppression of the Boer government by England in 1877 , the Boers fretted for three years , and made several appeals to England for a restoration of their liberties , but without result .
Parsing [sent. 8594 len. 29]: Then they gathered themselves together in a great mass-meeting at Krugersdorp , talked their troubles over , and resolved to fight for their deliverance from the British yoke .
Parsing [sent. 8595 len. 14]: -LRB- Krugersdorp -- the place where the Boers interrupted the Jameson raid . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 8596 len. 14]: The little handful of farmers rose against the strongest empire in the world .
Parsing [sent. 8597 len. 11]: They proclaimed martial law and the re-establishment of their Republic .
Parsing [sent. 8598 len. 14]: They organized their forces and sent them forward to intercept the British battalions .
Parsing [sent. 8599 len. 33]: This , although Sir Garnet Wolseley had but lately made proclamation that `` so long as the sun shone in the heavens , '' the Transvaal would be and remain English territory .
Parsing [sent. 8600 len. 46]: And also in spite of the fact that the commander of the 94th regiment -- already on the march to suppress this rebellion -- had been heard to say that `` the Boers would turn tail at the first beat of the big drum . ''

Parsing [sent. 8603 len. 57]: Four days after the flag-raising , the Boer force which had been sent forward to forbid the invasion of the English troops met them at Bronkhorst Spruit -- 246 men of the 94th regiment , in command of a colonel , the big drum beating , the band playing -- and the first battle was fought .
Parsing [sent. 8604 len. 5]: It lasted ten minutes .
Parsing [sent. 8605 len. 17]: Result : British loss , more than 150 officers and men , out of the 246 .
Parsing [sent. 8606 len. 5]: Surrender of the remnant .
Parsing [sent. 8607 len. 9]: Boer loss -- if any -- not stated .
Parsing [sent. 8608 len. 8]: They are fine marksmen , the Boers .
Parsing [sent. 8609 len. 17]: From the cradle up , they live on horseback and hunt wild animals with the rifle .
Parsing [sent. 8610 len. 16]: They have a passion for liberty and the Bible , and care for nothing else .
Parsing [sent. 8611 len. 38]: `` General Sir George Colley , Lieutenant-Governor and Commander-in-Chief in Natal , felt it his duty to proceed at once to the relief of the loyalists and soldiers beleaguered in the different towns of the Transvaal . ''
Parsing [sent. 8612 len. 10]: He moved out with 1,000 men and some artillery .
Parsing [sent. 8613 len. 25]: He found the Boers encamped in a strong and sheltered position on high ground at Laing 's Nek -- every Boer behind a rock .
Parsing [sent. 8614 len. 54]: Early in the morning of the 28th January , 1881 , he moved to the attack `` with the 58th regiment , commanded by Colonel Deane , a mounted squadron of 70 men , the 60th Rifles , the Naval Brigade with three rocket tubes , and the Artillery with six guns . ''
Parsing [sent. 8615 len. 24]: He shelled the Boers for twenty minutes , then the assault was delivered , the 58th marching up the slope in solid column .
Parsing [sent. 8616 len. 23]: The battle was soon finished , with this result , according to Russell -- British loss in killed and wounded , 174 .
Parsing [sent. 8617 len. 7]: Boer loss , `` trifling . ''
Parsing [sent. 8618 len. 32]: Colonel Deane was killed , and apparently every officer above the grade of lieutenant was killed or wounded , for the 58th retreated to its camp in command of a lieutenant .
Parsing [sent. 8619 len. 9]: -LRB- `` Africa as It Is . '' -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 8620 len. 6]: That ended the second battle .
Parsing [sent. 8621 len. 16]: On the 7th of February General Colley discovered that the Boers were flanking his position .
Parsing [sent. 8622 len. 40]: The next morning he left his camp at Mount Pleasant and marched out and crossed the Ingogo river with 270 men , started up the Ingogo heights , and there fought a battle which lasted from noon till nightfall .
Parsing [sent. 8623 len. 27]: He then retreated , leaving his wounded with his military chaplain , and in recrossing the now swollen river lost some of his men by drowning .
Parsing [sent. 8624 len. 7]: That was the third Boer victory .
Parsing [sent. 8625 len. 15]: Result , according to Mr. Russell -- British loss 150 out of 270 engaged .
Parsing [sent. 8626 len. 11]: Boer loss , 8 killed , 9 wounded -- 17 .
Parsing [sent. 8627 len. 54]: There was a season of quiet , now , but at the end of about three weeks Sir George Colley conceived the idea of climbing , with an infantry and artillery force , the steep and rugged mountain of Amajuba in the night -- a bitter hard task , but he accomplished it .
Parsing [sent. 8628 len. 24]: On the way he left about 200 men to guard a strategic point , and took about 400 up the mountain with him .
Parsing [sent. 8629 len. 48]: When the sun rose in the morning , there was an unpleasant surprise for the Boers ; yonder were the English troops visible on top of the mountain two or three miles away , and now their own position was at the mercy of the English artillery .
Parsing [sent. 8630 len. 11]: The Boer chief resolved to retreat -- up that mountain .
Parsing [sent. 8631 len. 9]: He asked for volunteers , and got them .
Parsing [sent. 8632 len. 41]: The storming party crossed the swale and began to creep up the steeps , `` and from behind rocks and bushes they shot at the soldiers on the skyline as if they were stalking deer , '' says Mr. Russell .
Parsing [sent. 8633 len. 23]: There was `` continuous musketry fire , steady and fatal on the one side , wild and ineffectual on the other . ''
Parsing [sent. 8634 len. 15]: The Boers reached the top , and began to put in their ruinous work .
Parsing [sent. 8635 len. 16]: Presently the British `` broke and fled for their lives down the rugged steep . ''
Parsing [sent. 8636 len. 7]: The Boers had won the battle .
Parsing [sent. 8637 len. 24]: Result in killed and wounded , including among the killed the British General : British loss , 226 , out of 400 engaged .
Parsing [sent. 8638 len. 9]: Boer loss , 1 killed , 5 wounded .
Parsing [sent. 8639 len. 5]: That ended the war .
Parsing [sent. 8640 len. 38]: England listened to reason , and recognized the Boer Republic -- a government which has never been in any really awful danger since , until Jameson started after it with his 500 `` raw young fellows . ''
Parsing [sent. 8641 len. 20]: To recapitulate : The Boer farmers and British soldiers fought 4 battles , and the Boers won them all .
Parsing [sent. 8642 len. 16]: Result of the 4 , in killed and wounded : British loss , 700 men .
Parsing [sent. 8643 len. 11]: Boer loss , so far as known , 23 men .
Parsing [sent. 8644 len. 27]: It is interesting , now , to note how loyally Jameson and his several trained British military officers tried to make their battles conform to precedent .
Parsing [sent. 8645 len. 28]: Mr. Garrett 's account of the Raid is much the best one I have met with , and my impressions of the Raid are drawn from that .
Parsing [sent. 8646 len. 25]: When Jameson learned that near Krugersdorp he would find 800 Boers waiting to dispute his passage , he was not in the least disturbed .
Parsing [sent. 8647 len. 47]: He was feeling as he had felt two or three days before , when he had opened his campaign with a historic remark to the same purport as the one with which the commander of the 94th had opened the Boer-British war of fourteen years before .
Parsing [sent. 8648 len. 23]: That Commander 's remark was , that the Boers `` would turn tail at the first beat of the big drum . ''
Parsing [sent. 8649 len. 29]: Jameson 's was , that with his `` raw young fellows '' he could kick the -LRB- persons -RRB- of the Boers `` all round the Transvaal . ''
Parsing [sent. 8650 len. 8]: He was keeping close to historic precedent .
Parsing [sent. 8651 len. 9]: Jameson arrived in the presence of the Boers .
Parsing [sent. 8652 len. 10]: They -- according to precedent -- were not visible .
Parsing [sent. 8653 len. 36]: It was a country of ridges , depressions , rocks , ditches , moraines of mining-tailings -- not even as favorable for cavalry work as Laing 's Nek had been in the former disastrous days .
Parsing [sent. 8654 len. 34]: Jameson shot at the ridges and rocks with his artillery , just as General Colley had done at the Nek ; and did them no damage and persuaded no Boer to show himself .
Parsing [sent. 8655 len. 69]: Then about a hundred of his men formed up to charge the ridge-according to the 58th 's precedent at the Nek ; but as they dashed forward they opened out in a long line , which was a considerable improvement on the 58th 's tactics ; when they had gotten to within 200 yards of the ridge the concealed Boers opened out on them and emptied 20 saddles .
Parsing [sent. 8656 len. 56]: The unwounded dismounted and fired at the rocks over the backs of their horses ; but the return-fire was too hot , and they mounted again , `` and galloped back or crawled away into a clump of reeds for cover , where they were shortly afterward taken prisoners as they lay among the reeds .
Parsing [sent. 8657 len. 30]: Some thirty prisoners were so taken , and during the night which followed the Boers carried away another thirty killed and wounded -- the wounded to Krugersdorp hospital . ''
Parsing [sent. 8658 len. 4]: Sixty per cent .
Parsing [sent. 8659 len. 14]: of the assaulted force disposed of -- according to Mr. Garrett 's estimate .
Parsing [sent. 8660 len. 19]: It was according to Amajuba precedent , where the British loss was 226 out of about 400 engaged .
Parsing [sent. 8661 len. 22]: Also , in Jameson 's camp , that night , `` there lay about 30 wounded or otherwise disabled '' men .
Parsing [sent. 8662 len. 23]: Also during the night `` some 30 or 40 young fellows got separated from the command and straggled through into Johannesburg . ''
Parsing [sent. 8663 len. 12]: Altogether a possible 150 men gone , out of his 530 .
Parsing [sent. 8664 len. 25]: His lads had fought valorously , but had not been able to get near enough to a Boer to kick him around the Transvaal .
Parsing [sent. 8665 len. 17]: At dawn the next morning the column of something short of 400 whites resumed its march .
Parsing [sent. 8666 len. 14]: Jameson 's grit was stubbornly good ; indeed , it was always that .
Parsing [sent. 8667 len. 5]: He still had hopes .
Parsing [sent. 8668 len. 43]: There was a long and tedious zigzagging march through broken ground , with constant harassment from the Boers ; and at last the column `` walked into a sort of trap , '' and the Boers `` closed in upon it . ''
Parsing [sent. 8669 len. 9]: `` Men and horses dropped on all sides .
Parsing [sent. 8670 len. 23]: In the column the feeling grew that unless it could burst through the Boer lines at this point it was done for .
Parsing [sent. 8671 len. 29]: The Maxims were fired until they grew too hot , and , water failing for the cool jacket , five of them jammed and went out of action .
Parsing [sent. 8672 len. 17]: The 7-pounder was fired until only half an hour 's ammunition was left to fire with .
Parsing [sent. 8673 len. 28]: One last rush was made , and failed , and then the Staats Artillery came up on the left flank , and the game was up . ''
Parsing [sent. 8674 len. 8]: Jameson hoisted a white flag and surrendered .
Parsing [sent. 8675 len. 30]: There is a story , which may not be true , about an ignorant Boer farmer there who thought that this white flag was the national flag of England .
Parsing [sent. 8676 len. 35]: He had been at Bronkhorst , and Laing 's Nek , and Ingogo and Amajuba , and supposed that the English did not run up their flag excepting at the end of a fight .
Parsing [sent. 8677 len. 40]: The following is -LRB- as I understand it -RRB- Mr. Garrett 's estimate of Jameson 's total loss in killed and wounded for the two days : `` When they gave in they were minus some 20 per cent .
Parsing [sent. 8678 len. 3]: of combatants .
Parsing [sent. 8679 len. 5]: There were 76 casualties .
Parsing [sent. 8680 len. 11]: There were 30 men hurt or sick in the wagons .
Parsing [sent. 8681 len. 12]: There were 27 killed on the spot or mortally wounded . ''
Parsing [sent. 8682 len. 10]: Total , 133 , out of the original 530 .
Parsing [sent. 8683 len. 7]: It is just 25 per cent .
Parsing [sent. 8684 len. 34]: -- -LSB- However , I judge that the total was really 150 ; for the number of wounded carried to Krugersdorp hospital was 53 ; not 30 , as Mr. Garrett reports it .
Parsing [sent. 8685 len. 13]: The lady whose guest I was in Krugersdorp gave me the figures .
Parsing [sent. 8686 len. 22]: She was head nurse from the beginning of hostilities -LRB- Jan. 1 -RRB- until the professional nurses arrived , Jan. 8th .
Parsing [sent. 8687 len. 18]: Of the 53 , `` Three or four were Boers '' ; I quote her words . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 8688 len. 41]: -- This is a large improvement upon the precedents established at Bronkhorst , Laing 's Nek , Ingogo , and Amajuba , and seems to indicate that Boer marksmanship is not so good now as it was in those days .
Parsing [sent. 8689 len. 13]: But there is one detail in which the Raid-episode exactly repeats history .
Parsing [sent. 8690 len. 25]: By surrender at Bronkhorst , the whole British force disappeared from the theater of war ; this was the case with Jameson 's force .
Parsing [sent. 8691 len. 15]: In the Boer loss , also , historical precedent is followed with sufficient fidelity .
Parsing [sent. 8692 len. 33]: In the 4 battles named above , the Boer loss , so far as known , was an average of 6 men per battle , to the British average loss of 175 .
Parsing [sent. 8693 len. 19]: In Jameson 's battles , as per Boer official report , the Boer loss in killed was 4 .
Parsing [sent. 8694 len. 32]: Two of these were killed by the Boers themselves , by accident , the other by Jameson 's army -- one of them intentionally , the other by a pathetic mischance .
Parsing [sent. 8695 len. 41]: `` A young Boer named Jacobz was moving forward to give a drink to one of the wounded troopers -LRB- Jameson 's -RRB- after the first charge , when another wounded man , mistaking his intention ; shot him . ''
Parsing [sent. 8696 len. 20]: There were three or four wounded Boers in the Krugersdorp hospital , and apparently no others have been reported .
Parsing [sent. 8697 len. 26]: Mr. Garrett , `` on a balance of probabilities , fully accepts the official version , and thanks Heaven the killed was not larger . ''
Parsing [sent. 8698 len. 31]: As a military man , I wish to point out what seems to me to be military errors in the conduct of the campaign which we have just been considering .
Parsing [sent. 8699 len. 28]: I have seen active service in the field , and it was in the actualities of war that I acquired my training and my right to speak .
Parsing [sent. 8700 len. 27]: I served two weeks in the beginning of our Civil War , and during all that time commanded a battery of infantry composed of twelve men .
Parsing [sent. 8701 len. 15]: General Grant knew the history of my campaign , for I told it him .
Parsing [sent. 8702 len. 21]: I also told him the principle upon which I had conducted it ; which was , to tire the enemy .
Parsing [sent. 8703 len. 19]: I tired out and disqualified many battalions , yet never had a casualty myself nor lost a man .
Parsing [sent. 8704 len. 58]: General Grant was not given to paying compliments , yet he said frankly that if I had conducted the whole war much bloodshed would have been spared , and that what the army might have lost through the inspiriting results of collision in the field would have been amply made up by the liberalizing influences of travel .
Parsing [sent. 8705 len. 11]: Further endorsement does not seem to me to be necessary .
Parsing [sent. 8706 len. 12]: Let us now examine history , and see what it teaches .
Parsing [sent. 8707 len. 45]: In the 4 battles fought in 1881 and the two fought by Jameson , the British loss in killed , wounded , and prisoners , was substantially 1,300 men ; the Boer loss , as far as is ascertainable , was about 30 men .
Parsing [sent. 8708 len. 10]: These figures show that there was a defect somewhere .
Parsing [sent. 8709 len. 9]: It was not in the absence of courage .
Parsing [sent. 8710 len. 10]: I think it lay in the absence of discretion .
Parsing [sent. 8711 len. 45]: The Briton should have done one thing or the other : discarded British methods and fought the Boer with Boer methods , or augmented his own force until -- using British methods -- it should be large enough to equalize results with the Boer .
Parsing [sent. 8712 len. 13]: To retain the British method requires certain things , determinable by arithmetic .
Parsing [sent. 8713 len. 72]: If , for argument 's sake , we allow that the aggregate of 1,716 British soldiers engaged in the 4 early battles was opposed by the same aggregate of Boers , we have this result : the British loss of 700 and the Boer loss of 23 argues that in order to equalize results in future battles you must make the British force thirty times as strong as the Boer force .
Parsing [sent. 8714 len. 30]: Mr. Garrett shows that the Boer force immediately opposed to Jameson was 2,000 , and that there were 6,000 more on hand by the evening of the second day .
Parsing [sent. 8715 len. 29]: Arithmetic shows that in order to make himself the equal of the 8,000 Boers , Jameson should have had 240,000 men , whereas he merely had 530 boys .
Parsing [sent. 8716 len. 25]: From a military point of view , backed by the facts of history , I conceive that Jameson 's military judgment was at fault .
Parsing [sent. 8717 len. 3]: Another thing .
Parsing [sent. 8718 len. 12]: -- Jameson was encumbered by artillery , ammunition , and rifles .
Parsing [sent. 8719 len. 17]: The facts of the battle show that he should have had none of those things along .
Parsing [sent. 8720 len. 15]: They were heavy , they were in his way , they impeded his march .
Parsing [sent. 8721 len. 37]: There was nothing to shoot at but rocks -- he knew quite well that there would be nothing to shoot at but rocks -- and he knew that artillery and rifles have no effect upon rocks .
Parsing [sent. 8722 len. 7]: He was badly overloaded with unessentials .
Parsing [sent. 8723 len. 42]: He had 8 Maxims -- a Maxim is a kind of Gatling , I believe , and shoots about 500 bullets per minute ; he had one 12 1/2 - pounder cannon and two 7-pounders ; also , 145,000 rounds of ammunition .
Parsing [sent. 8724 len. 25]: He worked the Maxims so hard upon the rocks that five of them became disabled -- five of the Maxims , not the rocks .
Parsing [sent. 8725 len. 25]: It is believed that upwards of 100,000 rounds of ammunition of the various kinds were fired during the 21 hours that the battles lasted .
Parsing [sent. 8726 len. 4]: One man killed .
Parsing [sent. 8727 len. 7]: He must have been much mutilated .
Parsing [sent. 8728 len. 11]: It was a pity to bring those futile Maxims along .
Parsing [sent. 8729 len. 16]: Jameson should have furnished himself with a battery of Pudd ` nhead Wilson maxims instead .
Parsing [sent. 8730 len. 21]: They are much more deadly than those others , and they are easily carried , because they have no weight .
Parsing [sent. 8731 len. 42]: Mr. Garrett -- not very carefully concealing a smile -- excuses the presence of the Maxims by saying that they were of very substantial use because their sputtering disordered the aim of the Boers , and in that way saved lives .
Parsing [sent. 8732 len. 57]: Three cannon , eight Maxims , and five hundred rifles yielded a result which emphasized a fact which had already been established -- that the British system of standing out in the open to fight Boers who are behind rocks is not wise , not excusable , and ought to be abandoned for something more efficacious .
Parsing [sent. 8733 len. 15]: For the purpose of war is to kill , not merely to waste ammunition .
Parsing [sent. 8734 len. 26]: If I could get the management of one of those campaigns , I would know what to do , for I have studied the Boer .
Parsing [sent. 8735 len. 9]: He values the Bible above every other thing .
Parsing [sent. 8736 len. 12]: The most delicious edible in South Africa is `` biltong . ''
Parsing [sent. 8737 len. 12]: You will have seen it mentioned in Olive Schreiner 's books .
Parsing [sent. 8738 len. 11]: It is what our plainsmen call `` jerked beef . ''
Parsing [sent. 8739 len. 8]: It is the Boer 's main standby .
Parsing [sent. 8740 len. 12]: He has a passion for it , and he is right .
Parsing [sent. 8741 len. 26]: If I had the command of the campaign I would go with rifles only , no cumbersome Maxims and cannon to spoil good rocks with .
Parsing [sent. 8742 len. 44]: I would move surreptitiously by night to a point about a quarter of a mile from the Boer camp , and there I would build up a pyramid of biltong and Bibles fifty feet high , and then conceal my men all about .
Parsing [sent. 8743 len. 20]: In the morning the Boers would send out spies , and then the rest would come with a rush .
Parsing [sent. 8744 len. 21]: I would surround them , and they would have to fight my men on equal terms , in the open .
Parsing [sent. 8745 len. 8]: There would n't be any Amajuba results .
Parsing [sent. 8746 len. 63]: -- -LSB- Just as I am finishing this book an unfortunate dispute has sprung up between Dr. Jameson and his officers , on the one hand , and Colonel Rhodes on the other , concerning the wording of a note which Colonel Rhodes sent from Johannesburg by a cyclist to Jameson just before hostilities began on the memorable New Year 's Day .
Parsing [sent. 8747 len. 35]: Some of the fragments of this note were found on the battlefield after the fight , and these have been pieced together ; the dispute is as to what words the lacking fragments contained .
Parsing [sent. 8748 len. 14]: Jameson says the note promised him a reinforcement of 300 men from Johannesburg .
Parsing [sent. 8749 len. 24]: Colonel Rhodes denies this , and says he merely promised to send out `` some '' men `` to meet you . '' -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 8750 len. 17]: -LSB- It seems a pity that these friends should fall out over so little a thing .
Parsing [sent. 8751 len. 14]: If the 300 had been sent , what good would it have done ?
Parsing [sent. 8752 len. 32]: In 21 hours of industrious fighting , Jameson 's 530 men , with 8 Maxims , 3 cannon , and 145,000 rounds of ammunition , killed an aggregate of 1 Boer .
Parsing [sent. 8753 len. 33]: These statistics show that a reinforcement of 300 Johannesburgers , armed merely with muskets , would have killed , at the outside , only a little over a half of another Boer .
Parsing [sent. 8754 len. 8]: This would not have saved the day .
Parsing [sent. 8755 len. 11]: It would not even have seriously affected the general result .
Parsing [sent. 8756 len. 52]: The figures show clearly , and with mathematical violence , that the only way to save Jameson , or even give him a fair and equal chance with the enemy , was for Johannesburg to send him 240 Maxims , 90 cannon , 600 carloads of ammunition , and 240,000 men .
Parsing [sent. 8757 len. 10]: Johannesburg was not in a position to do this .
Parsing [sent. 8758 len. 12]: Johannesburg has been called very hard names for not reinforcing Jameson .
Parsing [sent. 8759 len. 42]: But in every instance this has been done by two classes of persons -- people who do not read history , and people , like Jameson , who do not understand what it means , after they have read it . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 8760 len. 3]: CHAPTER LXVIII .
Parsing [sent. 8761 len. 22]: None of us can have as many virtues as the fountain-pen , or half its cussedness ; but we can try .
Parsing [sent. 8762 len. 9]: -- Pudd ` nhead Wilson 's New Calendar .
Parsing [sent. 8763 len. 13]: The Duke of Fife has borne testimony that Mr. Rhodes deceived him .
Parsing [sent. 8764 len. 11]: That is also what Mr. Rhodes did with the Reformers .
Parsing [sent. 8765 len. 12]: He got them into trouble , and then stayed out himself .
Parsing [sent. 8766 len. 4]: A judicious man .
Parsing [sent. 8767 len. 6]: He has always been that .
Parsing [sent. 8768 len. 12]: As to this there was a moment of doubt , once .
Parsing [sent. 8769 len. 16]: It was when he was out on his last pirating expedition in the Matabele country .
Parsing [sent. 8770 len. 18]: The cable shouted out that he had gone unarmed , to visit a party of hostile chiefs .
Parsing [sent. 8771 len. 21]: It was true , too ; and this dare-devil thing came near fetching another indiscretion out of the poet laureate .
Parsing [sent. 8772 len. 33]: It would have been too bad , for when the facts were all in , it turned out that there was a lady along , too , and she also was unarmed .
Parsing [sent. 8773 len. 23]: In the opinion of many people Mr. Rhodes is South Africa ; others think he is only a large part of it .
Parsing [sent. 8774 len. 24]: These latter consider that South Africa consists of Table Mountain , the diamond mines , the Johannesburg gold fields , and Cecil Rhodes .
Parsing [sent. 8775 len. 9]: The gold fields are wonderful in every way .
Parsing [sent. 8776 len. 46]: In seven or eight years they built up , in a desert , a city of a hundred thousand inhabitants , counting white and black together ; and not the ordinary mining city of wooden shanties , but a city made out of lasting material .
Parsing [sent. 8777 len. 16]: Nowhere in the world is there such a concentration of rich mines as at Johannesburg .
Parsing [sent. 8778 len. 89]: Mr. Bonamici , my manager there , gave me a small gold brick with some statistics engraved upon it which record the output of gold from the early days to July , 1895 , and exhibit the strides which have been made in the development of the industry ; in 1888 the output was $ 4,162,440 ; the output of the next five and a half years was -LRB- total -RRB- $ 17,585,894 ; for the single year ending with June , 1895 , it was $ 45,553,700 .
Parsing [sent. 8779 len. 17]: The capital which has developed the mines came from England , the mining engineers from America .
Parsing [sent. 8780 len. 10]: This is the case with the diamond mines also .
Parsing [sent. 8781 len. 14]: South Africa seems to be the heaven of the American scientific mining engineer .
Parsing [sent. 8782 len. 10]: He gets the choicest places , and keeps them .
Parsing [sent. 8783 len. 26]: His salary is not based upon what he would get in America , but apparently upon what a whole family of him would get there .
Parsing [sent. 8784 len. 21]: The successful mines pay great dividends , yet the rock is not rich , from a Californian point of view .
Parsing [sent. 8785 len. 15]: Rock which yields ten or twelve dollars a ton is considered plenty rich enough .
Parsing [sent. 8786 len. 93]: It is troubled with base metals to such a degree that twenty years ago it would have been only about half as valuable as it is now ; for at that time there was no paying way of getting anything out of such rock but the coarser-grained `` free '' gold ; but the new cyanide process has changed all that , and the gold fields of the world now deliver up fifty million dollars ' worth of gold per year which would have gone into the tailing-pile under the former conditions .
Parsing [sent. 8787 len. 47]: The cyanide process was new to me , and full of interest ; and among the costly and elaborate mining machinery there were fine things which were new to me , but I was already familiar with the rest of the details of the gold-mining industry .
Parsing [sent. 8788 len. 31]: I had been a gold miner myself , in my day , and knew substantially everything that those people knew about it , except how to make money at it .
Parsing [sent. 8789 len. 18]: But I learned a good deal about the Boers there , and that was a fresh subject .
Parsing [sent. 8790 len. 16]: What I heard there was afterwards repeated to me in other parts of South Africa .
Parsing [sent. 8791 len. 249]: Summed up -- according to the information thus gained -- this is the Boer : He is deeply religious , profoundly ignorant , dull , obstinate , bigoted , uncleanly in his habits , hospitable , honest in his dealings with the whites , a hard master to his black servant , lazy , a good shot , good horseman , addicted to the chase , a lover of political independence , a good husband and father , not fond of herding together in towns , but liking the seclusion and remoteness and solitude and empty vastness and silence of the veldt ; a man of a mighty appetite , and not delicate about what he appeases it with -- well-satisfied with pork and Indian corn and biltong , requiring only that the quantity shall not be stinted ; willing to ride a long journey to take a hand in a rude all-night dance interspersed with vigorous feeding and boisterous jollity , but ready to ride twice as far for a prayer-meeting ; proud of his Dutch and Huguenot origin and its religious and military history ; proud of his race 's achievements in South Africa , its bold plunges into hostile and uncharted deserts in search of free solitudes unvexed by the pestering and detested English , also its victories over the natives and the British ; proudest of all , of the direct and effusive personal interest which the Deity has always taken in its affairs .
Parsing [sent. 8792 len. 61]: He can not read , he can not write ; he has one or two newspapers , but he is , apparently , not aware of it ; until latterly he had no schools , and taught his children nothing , news is a term which has no meaning to him , and the thing itself he cares nothing about .
Parsing [sent. 8793 len. 9]: He hates to be taxed and resents it .
Parsing [sent. 8794 len. 38]: He has stood stock still in South Africa for two centuries and a half , and would like to stand still till the end of time , for he has no sympathy with Uitlander notions of progress .
Parsing [sent. 8795 len. 34]: He is hungry to be rich , for he is human ; but his preference has been for riches in cattle , not in fine clothes and fine houses and gold and diamonds .
Parsing [sent. 8796 len. 30]: The gold and the diamonds have brought the godless stranger within his gates , also contamination and broken repose , and he wishes that they had never been discovered .
Parsing [sent. 8797 len. 34]: I think that the bulk of those details can be found in Olive Schreiner 's books , and she would not be accused of sketching the Boer 's portrait with an unfair hand .
Parsing [sent. 8798 len. 10]: Now what would you expect from that unpromising material ?
Parsing [sent. 8799 len. 8]: What ought you to expect from it ?
Parsing [sent. 8800 len. 6]: Laws inimical to religious liberty ?
Parsing [sent. 8801 len. 2]: Yes .
Parsing [sent. 8802 len. 10]: Laws denying , representation and suffrage to the intruder ?
Parsing [sent. 8803 len. 2]: Yes .
Parsing [sent. 8804 len. 6]: Laws unfriendly to educational institutions ?
Parsing [sent. 8805 len. 2]: Yes .
Parsing [sent. 8806 len. 6]: Laws obstructive of gold production ?
Parsing [sent. 8807 len. 2]: Yes .
Parsing [sent. 8808 len. 5]: Discouragement of railway expansion ?
Parsing [sent. 8809 len. 2]: Yes .
Parsing [sent. 8810 len. 10]: Laws heavily taxing the intruder and overlooking the Boer ?
Parsing [sent. 8811 len. 2]: Yes .
Parsing [sent. 8812 len. 13]: The Uitlander seems to have expected something very different from all that .
Parsing [sent. 8813 len. 6]: I do not know why .
Parsing [sent. 8814 len. 10]: Nothing different from it was rationally to be expected .
Parsing [sent. 8815 len. 15]: A round man can not be expected to fit a square hole right away .
Parsing [sent. 8816 len. 9]: He must have time to modify his shape .
Parsing [sent. 8817 len. 20]: The modification had begun in a detail or two , before the Raid , and was making some progress .
Parsing [sent. 8818 len. 7]: It has made further progress since .
Parsing [sent. 8819 len. 28]: There are wise men in the Boer government , and that accounts for the modification ; the modification of the Boer mass has probably not begun yet .
Parsing [sent. 8820 len. 30]: If the heads of the Boer government had not been wise men they would have hanged Jameson , and thus turned a very commonplace pirate into a holy martyr .
Parsing [sent. 8821 len. 20]: But even their wisdom has its limits , and they will hang Mr. Rhodes if they ever catch him .
Parsing [sent. 8822 len. 13]: That will round him and complete him and make him a saint .
Parsing [sent. 8823 len. 28]: He has already been called by all other titles that symbolize human grandeur , and he ought to rise to this one , the grandest of all .
Parsing [sent. 8824 len. 32]: It will be a dizzy jump from where he is now , but that is nothing , it will land him in good company and be a pleasant change for him .
Parsing [sent. 8825 len. 31]: Some of the things demanded by the Johannesburgers ' Manifesto have been conceded since the days of the Raid , and the others will follow in time , no doubt .
Parsing [sent. 8826 len. 58]: It was most fortunate for the miners of Johannesburg that the taxes which distressed them so much were levied by the Boer government , instead of by their friend Rhodes and his Chartered Company of highwaymen , for these latter take half of whatever their mining victims find , they do not stop at a mere percentage .
Parsing [sent. 8827 len. 18]: If the Johannesburg miners were under their jurisdiction they would be in the poorhouse in twelve months .
Parsing [sent. 8828 len. 28]: I have been under the impression all along that I had an unpleasant paragraph about the Boers somewhere in my notebook , and also a pleasant one .
Parsing [sent. 8829 len. 6]: I have found them now .
Parsing [sent. 8830 len. 18]: The unpleasant one is dated at an interior village , and says -- `` Mr. Z. called .
Parsing [sent. 8831 len. 17]: He is an English Afrikander ; is an old resident , and has a Boer wife .
Parsing [sent. 8832 len. 15]: He speaks the language , and his professional business is with the Boers exclusively .
Parsing [sent. 8833 len. 68]: He told me that the ancient Boer families in the great region of which this village is the commercial center are falling victims to their inherited indolence and dullness in the materialistic latter-day race and struggle , and are dropping one by one into the grip of the usurer -- getting hopelessly in debt -- and are losing their high place and retiring to second and lower .
Parsing [sent. 8834 len. 20]: The Boer 's farm does not go to another Boer when he loses it , but to a foreigner .
Parsing [sent. 8835 len. 15]: Some have fallen so low that they sell their daughters to the blacks . ''
Parsing [sent. 8836 len. 59]: Under date of another South African town I find the note which is creditable to the Boers : `` Dr. X. told me that in the Kafir war 1,500 Kafirs took refuge in a great cave in the mountains about 90 miles north of Johannesburg , and the Boers blocked up the entrance and smoked them to death .
Parsing [sent. 8837 len. 30]: Dr. X. has been in there and seen the great array of bleached skeletons -- one a woman with the skeleton of a child hugged to her breast . ''
Parsing [sent. 8838 len. 9]: The great bulk of the savages must go .
Parsing [sent. 8839 len. 34]: The white man wants their lands , and all must go excepting such percentage of them as he will need to do his work for him upon terms to be determined by himself .
Parsing [sent. 8840 len. 37]: Since history has removed the element of guesswork from this matter and made it certainty , the humanest way of diminishing the black population should be adopted , not the old cruel ways of the past .
Parsing [sent. 8841 len. 12]: Mr. Rhodes and his gang have been following the old ways .
Parsing [sent. 8842 len. 24]: -- They are chartered to rob and slay , and they lawfully do it , but not in a compassionate and Christian spirit .
Parsing [sent. 8843 len. 23]: They rob the Mashonas and the Matabeles of a portion of their territories in the hallowed old style of `` purchase ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8844 len. 19]: for a song , and then they force a quarrel and take the rest by the strong hand .
Parsing [sent. 8845 len. 28]: They rob the natives of their cattle under the pretext that all the cattle in the country belonged to the king whom they have tricked and assassinated .
Parsing [sent. 8846 len. 27]: They issue `` regulations '' requiring the incensed and harassed natives to work for the white settlers , and neglect their own affairs to do it .
Parsing [sent. 8847 len. 53]: This is slavery , and is several times worse than was the American slavery which used to pain England so much ; for when this Rhodesian slave is sick , super-annuated , or otherwise disabled , he must support himself or starve -- his master is under no obligation to support him .
Parsing [sent. 8848 len. 33]: The reduction of the population by Rhodesian methods to the desired limit is a return to the old-time slow-misery and lingering-death system of a discredited time and a crude `` civilization . ''
Parsing [sent. 8849 len. 47]: We humanely reduce an overplus of dogs by swift chloroform ; the Boer humanely reduced an overplus of blacks by swift suffocation ; the nameless but right-hearted Australian pioneer humanely reduced his overplus of aboriginal neighbors by a sweetened swift death concealed in a poisoned pudding .
Parsing [sent. 8850 len. 59]: All these are admirable , and worthy of praise ; you and I would rather suffer either of these deaths thirty times over in thirty successive days than linger out one of the Rhodesian twenty-year deaths , with its daily burden of insult , humiliation , and forced labor for a man whose entire race the victim hates .
Parsing [sent. 8851 len. 21]: Rhodesia is a happy name for that land of piracy and pillage , and puts the right stain upon it .
Parsing [sent. 8852 len. 33]: Several long journeys -- gave us experience of the Cape Colony railways ; easy-riding , fine cars ; all the conveniences ; thorough cleanliness ; comfortable beds furnished for the night trains .
Parsing [sent. 8853 len. 23]: It was in the first days of June , and winter ; the daytime was pleasant , the nighttime nice and cold .
Parsing [sent. 8854 len. 109]: Spinning along all day in the cars it was ecstasy to breathe the bracing air and gaze out over the vast brown solitudes of the velvet plains , soft and lovely near by , still softer and lovelier further away , softest and loveliest of all in the remote distances , where dim island-hills seemed afloat , as in a sea -- a sea made of dream-stuff and flushed with colors faint and rich ; and dear me , the depth of the sky , and the beauty of the strange new cloud-forms , and the glory of the sunshine , the lavishness , the wastefulness of it !
Parsing [sent. 8855 len. 29]: The vigor and freshness and inspiration of the air and the sun -- well , it was all just as Olive Schreiner had made it in her books .
Parsing [sent. 8856 len. 15]: To me the veldt , in its sober winter garb , was surpassingly beautiful .
Parsing [sent. 8857 len. 73]: There were unlevel stretches where it was rolling and swelling , and rising and subsiding , and sweeping superbly on and on , and still on and on like an ocean , toward the faraway horizon , its pale brown deepening by delicately graduated shades to rich orange , and finally to purple and crimson where it washed against the wooded hills and naked red crags at the base of the sky .
Parsing [sent. 8858 len. 45]: Everywhere , from Cape Town to Kimberley and from Kimberley to Port Elizabeth and East London , the towns were well populated with tamed blacks ; tamed and Christianized too , I suppose , for they wore the dowdy clothes of our Christian civilization .
Parsing [sent. 8859 len. 13]: But for that , many of them would have been remarkably handsome .
Parsing [sent. 8860 len. 76]: These fiendish clothes , together with the proper lounging gait , good-natured face , happy air , and easy laugh , made them precise counterparts of our American blacks ; often where all the other aspects were strikingly and harmoniously and thrillingly African , a flock of these natives would intrude , looking wholly out of place , and spoil it all , making the thing a grating discord , half African and half American .
Parsing [sent. 8861 len. 95]: One Sunday in King William 's Town a score of colored women came mincing across the great barren square dressed -- oh , in the last perfection of fashion , and newness , and expensiveness , and showy mixture of unrelated colors , -- all just as I had seen it so often at home ; and in their faces and their gait was that languishing , aristocratic , divine delight in their finery which was so familiar to me , and had always been such a satisfaction to my eye and my heart .
Parsing [sent. 8862 len. 21]: I seemed among old , old friends ; friends of fifty years , and I stopped and cordially greeted them .
Parsing [sent. 8863 len. 20]: They broke into a good-fellowship laugh , flashing their white teeth upon me , and all answered at once .
Parsing [sent. 8864 len. 9]: I did not understand a word they said .
Parsing [sent. 8865 len. 17]: I was astonished ; I was not dreaming that they would answer in anything but American .
Parsing [sent. 8866 len. 30]: The voices , too , of the African women , were familiar to me sweet and musical , just like those of the slave women of my early days .
Parsing [sent. 8867 len. 34]: I followed a couple of them all over the Orange Free State -- no , over its capital -- Bloemfontein , to hear their liquid voices and the happy ripple of their laughter .
Parsing [sent. 8868 len. 9]: Their language was a large improvement upon American .
Parsing [sent. 8869 len. 5]: Also upon the Zulu .
Parsing [sent. 8870 len. 41]: It had no Zulu clicks in it ; and it seemed to have no angles or corners , no roughness , no vile s 's or other hissing sounds , but was very , very mellow and rounded and flowing .
Parsing [sent. 8871 len. 22]: In moving about the country in the trains , I had opportunity to see a good many Boers of the veldt .
Parsing [sent. 8872 len. 19]: One day at a village station a hundred of them got out of the third-class cars to feed .
Parsing [sent. 8873 len. 6]: Their clothes were very interesting .
Parsing [sent. 8874 len. 19]: For ugliness of shapes , and for miracles of ugly colors inharmoniously associated , they were a record .
Parsing [sent. 8875 len. 29]: The effect was nearly as exciting and interesting as that produced by the brilliant and beautiful clothes and perfect taste always on view at the Indian railway stations .
Parsing [sent. 8876 len. 12]: One man had corduroy trousers of a faded chewing gum tint .
Parsing [sent. 8877 len. 28]: And they were new -- showing that this tint did not come by calamity , but was intentional ; the very ugliest color I have ever seen .
Parsing [sent. 8878 len. 47]: A gaunt , shackly country lout six feet high , in battered gray slouched hat with wide brim , and old resin-colored breeches , had on a hideous brand-new woolen coat which was imitation tiger skin -- wavy broad stripes of dazzling yellow and deep brown .
Parsing [sent. 8879 len. 18]: I thought he ought to be hanged , and asked the station-master if it could be arranged .
Parsing [sent. 8880 len. 24]: He said no ; and not only that , but said it rudely ; said it with a quite unnecessary show of feeling .
Parsing [sent. 8881 len. 32]: Then he muttered something about my being a jackass , and walked away and pointed me out to people , and did everything he could to turn public sentiment against me .
Parsing [sent. 8882 len. 11]: It is what one gets for trying to do good .
Parsing [sent. 8883 len. 20]: In the train that day a passenger told me some more about Boer life out in the lonely veldt .
Parsing [sent. 8884 len. 73]: He said the Boer gets up early and sets his `` niggers '' at their tasks -LRB- pasturing the cattle , and watching them -RRB- ; eats , smokes , drowses , sleeps ; toward evening superintends the milking , etc. ; eats , smokes , drowses ; goes to bed at early candlelight in the fragrant clothes he -LRB- and she -RRB- have worn all day and every week-day for years .
Parsing [sent. 8885 len. 18]: I remember that last detail , in Olive Schreiner 's `` Story of an African Farm . ''
Parsing [sent. 8886 len. 15]: And the passenger told me that the Boers were justly noted for their hospitality .
Parsing [sent. 8887 len. 8]: He told me a story about it .
Parsing [sent. 8888 len. 90]: He said that his grace the Bishop of a certain See was once making a business-progress through the tavernless veldt , and one night he stopped with a Boer ; after supper was shown to bed ; he undressed , weary and worn out , and was soon sound asleep ; in the night he woke up feeling crowded and suffocated , and found the old Boer and his fat wife in bed with him , one on each side , with all their clothes on , and snoring .
Parsing [sent. 8889 len. 27]: He had to stay there and stand it -- awake and suffering -- until toward dawn , when sleep again fell upon him for an hour .
Parsing [sent. 8890 len. 5]: Then he woke again .
Parsing [sent. 8891 len. 14]: The Boer was gone , but the wife was still at his side .
Parsing [sent. 8892 len. 53]: Those Reformers detested that Boer prison ; they were not used to cramped quarters and tedious hours , and weary idleness , and early to bed , and limited movement , and arbitrary and irritating rules , and the absence of the luxuries which wealth comforts the day and the night with .
Parsing [sent. 8893 len. 31]: The confinement told upon their bodies and their spirits ; still , they were superior men , and they made the best that was to be made of the circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 8894 len. 19]: Their wives smuggled delicacies to them , which helped to smooth the way down for the prison fare .
Parsing [sent. 8895 len. 22]: In the train Mr. B. told me that the Boer jail-guards treated the black prisoners -- even political ones -- mercilessly .
Parsing [sent. 8896 len. 30]: An African chief and his following had been kept there nine months without trial , and during all that time they had been without shelter from rain and sun .
Parsing [sent. 8897 len. 57]: He said that one day the guards put a big black in the stocks for dashing his soup on the ground ; they stretched his legs painfully wide apart , and set him with his back down hill ; he could not endure it , and put back his hands upon the slope for a support .
Parsing [sent. 8898 len. 15]: The guard ordered him to withdraw the support and kicked him in the back .
Parsing [sent. 8899 len. 37]: `` Then , '' said Mr. B. , '' ` the powerful black wrenched the stocks asunder and went for the guard ; a Reform prisoner pulled him off , and thrashed the guard himself . ''
Parsing [sent. 8900 len. 3]: CHAPTER LXIX .
Parsing [sent. 8901 len. 14]: The very ink with which all history is written is merely fluid prejudice .
Parsing [sent. 8902 len. 9]: -- Pudd ` nhead Wilsons 's New Calendar .
Parsing [sent. 8903 len. 22]: There is n't a Parallel of Latitude but thinks it would have been the Equator if it had had its rights .
Parsing [sent. 8904 len. 9]: -- Pudd ` nhead Wilson 's New Calendar .
Parsing [sent. 8905 len. 20]: Next to Mr. Rhodes , to me the most interesting convulsion of nature in South Africa was the diamond-crater .
Parsing [sent. 8906 len. 119]: The Rand gold fields are a stupendous marvel , and they make all other gold fields small , but I was not a stranger to gold-mining ; the veldt was a noble thing to see , but it was only another and lovelier variety of our Great Plains ; the natives were very far from being uninteresting , but they were not new ; and as for the towns , I could find my way without a guide through the most of them because I had learned the streets , under other names , in towns just like them in other lands ; but the diamond mine was a wholly fresh thing , a splendid and absorbing novelty .
Parsing [sent. 8907 len. 14]: Very few people in the world have seen the diamond in its home .
Parsing [sent. 8908 len. 17]: It has but three or four homes in the world , whereas gold has a million .
Parsing [sent. 8909 len. 40]: It is worth while to journey around the globe to see anything which can truthfully be called a novelty , and the diamond mine is the greatest and most select and restricted novelty which the globe has in stock .
Parsing [sent. 8910 len. 12]: The Kimberley diamond deposits were discovered about 1869 , I think .
Parsing [sent. 8911 len. 32]: When everything is taken into consideration , the wonder is that they were not discovered five thousand years ago and made familiar to the African world for the rest of time .
Parsing [sent. 8912 len. 15]: For this reason the first diamonds were found on the surface of the ground .
Parsing [sent. 8913 len. 14]: They were smooth and limpid , and in the sunlight they vomited fire .
Parsing [sent. 8914 len. 26]: They were the very things which an African savage of any era would value above every other thing in the world excepting a glass bead .
Parsing [sent. 8915 len. 56]: For two or three centuries we have been buying his lands , his cattle , his neighbor , and any other thing he had for sale , for glass beads and so it is strange that he was indifferent to the diamonds -- for he must have picked them up many and many a time .
Parsing [sent. 8916 len. 107]: It would not occur to him to try to sell them to whites , of course , since the whites already had plenty of glass beads , and more fashionably shaped , too , than these ; but one would think that the poorer sort of black , who could not afford real glass , would have been humbly content to decorate himself with the imitation , and that presently the white trader would notice the things , and dimly suspect , and carry some of them home , and find out what they were , and at once empty a multitude of fortune-hunters into Africa .
Parsing [sent. 8917 len. 29]: There are many strange things in human history ; one of the strangest is that the sparkling diamonds laid there so long without exciting any one 's interest .
Parsing [sent. 8918 len. 8]: The revelation came at last by accident .
Parsing [sent. 8919 len. 43]: In a Boer 's hut out in the wide solitude of the plains , a traveling stranger noticed a child playing with a bright object , and was told it was a piece of glass which had been found in the veldt .
Parsing [sent. 8920 len. 52]: The stranger bought it for a trifle and carried it away ; and being without honor , made another stranger believe it was a diamond , and so got $ 125 out of him for it , and was as pleased with himself as if he had done a righteous thing .
Parsing [sent. 8921 len. 58]: In Paris the wronged stranger sold it to a pawnshop for $ 10,000 , who sold it to a countess for $ 90,000 , who sold it to a brewer for $ 800,000 , who traded it to a king for a dukedom and a pedigree , and the king `` put it up the spout . ''
Parsing [sent. 8922 len. 16]: -- -LSB- handwritten note : `` From the Greek meaning ` pawned it . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 8923 len. 11]: M.T. -RSB- -- I know these particulars to be correct .
Parsing [sent. 8924 len. 12]: The news flew around , and the South African diamond-boom began .
Parsing [sent. 8925 len. 68]: The original traveler -- the dishonest one -- now remembered that he had once seen a Boer teamster chocking his wagon-wheel on a steep grade with a diamond as large as a football , and he laid aside his occupations and started out to hunt for it , but not with the intention of cheating anybody out of $ 125 with it , for he had reformed .
Parsing [sent. 8926 len. 8]: We now come to matters more didactic .
Parsing [sent. 8927 len. 31]: Diamonds are not imbedded in rock ledges fifty miles long , like the Johannesburg gold , but are distributed through the rubbish of a filled-up well , so to speak .
Parsing [sent. 8928 len. 19]: The well is rich , its walls are sharply defined ; outside of the walls are no diamonds .
Parsing [sent. 8929 len. 11]: The well is a crater , and a large one .
Parsing [sent. 8930 len. 28]: Before it had been meddled with , its surface was even with the level plain , and there was no sign to suggest that it was there .
Parsing [sent. 8931 len. 44]: The pasturage covering the surface of the Kimberley crater was sufficient for the support of a cow , and the pasturage underneath was sufficient for the support of a kingdom ; but the cow did not know it , and lost her chance .
Parsing [sent. 8932 len. 39]: The Kimberley crater is roomy enough to admit the Roman Coliseum ; the bottom of the crater has not been reached , and no one can tell how far down in the bowels of the earth it goes .
Parsing [sent. 8933 len. 33]: Originally , it was a perpendicular hole packed solidly full of blue rock or cement , and scattered through that blue mass , like raisins in a pudding , were the diamonds .
Parsing [sent. 8934 len. 20]: As deep down in the earth as the blue stuff extends , so deep will the diamonds be found .
Parsing [sent. 8935 len. 22]: There are three or four other celebrated craters near by -- a circle three miles in diameter would enclose them all .
Parsing [sent. 8936 len. 24]: They are owned by the De Beers Company , a consolidation of diamond properties arranged by Mr. Rhodes twelve or fourteen years ago .
Parsing [sent. 8937 len. 36]: The De Beers owns other craters ; they are under the grass , but the De Beers knows where they are , and will open them some day , if the market should require it .
Parsing [sent. 8938 len. 35]: Originally , the diamond deposits were the property of the Orange Free State ; but a judicious `` rectification '' of the boundary line shifted them over into the British territory of Cape Colony .
Parsing [sent. 8939 len. 69]: A high official of the Free State told me that the sum of $ 400,000 was handed to his commonwealth as a compromise , or indemnity , or something of the sort , and that he thought his commonwealth did wisely to take the money and keep out of a dispute , since the power was all on the one side and the weakness all on the other .
Parsing [sent. 8940 len. 16]: The De Beers Company dig out $ 400,000 worth of diamonds per week , now .
Parsing [sent. 8941 len. 32]: The Cape got the territory , but no profit ; for Mr. Rhodes and the Rothschilds and the other De Beers people own the mines , and they pay no taxes .
Parsing [sent. 8942 len. 23]: In our day the mines are worked upon scientific principles , under the guidance of the ablest mining-engineering talent procurable in America .
Parsing [sent. 8943 len. 29]: There are elaborate works for reducing the blue rock and passing it through one process after another until every diamond it contains has been hunted down and secured .
Parsing [sent. 8944 len. 51]: I watched the `` concentrators '' at work big tanks containing mud and water and invisible diamonds -- and was told that each could stir and churn and properly treat 300 car-loads of mud per day 1,600 pounds to the car-load -- and reduce it to 3 car-loads of slush .
Parsing [sent. 8945 len. 28]: I saw the 3 carloads of slush taken to the `` pulsators '' and there reduced to a quarter of a load of nice clean dark-colored sand .
Parsing [sent. 8946 len. 31]: Then I followed it to the sorting tables and saw the men deftly and swiftly spread it out and brush it about and seize the diamonds as they showed up .
Parsing [sent. 8947 len. 16]: I assisted , and once I found a diamond half as large as an almond .
Parsing [sent. 8948 len. 35]: It is an exciting kind of fishing , and you feel a fine thrill of pleasure every time you detect the glow of one of those limpid pebbles through the veil of dark sand .
Parsing [sent. 8949 len. 17]: I would like to spend my Saturday holidays in that charming sport every now and then .
Parsing [sent. 8950 len. 6]: Of course there are disappointments .
Parsing [sent. 8951 len. 23]: Sometimes you find a diamond which is not a diamond ; it is only a quartz crystal or some such worthless thing .
Parsing [sent. 8952 len. 34]: The expert can generally distinguish it from the precious stone which it is counterfeiting ; but if he is in doubt he lays it on a flatiron and hits it with a sledgehammer .
Parsing [sent. 8953 len. 22]: If it is a diamond it holds its own ; if it is anything else , it is reduced to powder .
Parsing [sent. 8954 len. 16]: I liked that experiment very much , and did not tire of repetitions of it .
Parsing [sent. 8955 len. 15]: It was full of enjoyable apprehensions , unmarred by any personal sense of risk .
Parsing [sent. 8956 len. 27]: The De Beers concern treats 8,000 carloads -- about 6,000 tons -- of blue rock per day , and the result is three pounds of diamonds .
Parsing [sent. 8957 len. 10]: Value , uncut , $ 50,000 to $ 70,000 .
Parsing [sent. 8958 len. 27]: After cutting , they will weigh considerably less than a pound , but will be worth four or five times as much as they were before .
Parsing [sent. 8959 len. 31]: All the plain around that region is spread over , a foot deep , with blue rock , placed there by the Company , and looks like a plowed field .
Parsing [sent. 8960 len. 23]: Exposure for a length of time make the rock easier to work than it is when it comes out of the mine .
Parsing [sent. 8961 len. 30]: If mining should cease now , the supply of rock spread over those fields would furnish the usual 8,000 car-loads per day to the separating works during three years .
Parsing [sent. 8962 len. 21]: The fields are fenced and watched ; and at night they are under the constant inspection of lofty electric searchlight .
Parsing [sent. 8963 len. 23]: They contain fifty or sixty million dollars ' worth ' of diamonds , and there is an abundance of enterprising thieves around .
Parsing [sent. 8964 len. 13]: In the dirt of the Kimberley streets there is much hidden wealth .
Parsing [sent. 8965 len. 14]: Some time ago the people were granted the privilege of a free wash-up .
Parsing [sent. 8966 len. 22]: There was a general rush , the work was done with thoroughness , and a good harvest of diamonds was gathered .
Parsing [sent. 8967 len. 8]: The deep mining is done by natives .
Parsing [sent. 8968 len. 7]: There are many hundreds of them .
Parsing [sent. 8969 len. 13]: They live in quarters built around the inside of a great compound .
Parsing [sent. 8970 len. 11]: They are a jolly and good-natured lot , and accommodating .
Parsing [sent. 8971 len. 17]: They performed a war-dance for us , which was the wildest exhibition I have ever seen .
Parsing [sent. 8972 len. 25]: They are not allowed outside of the compound during their term of service three months , I think it is , as a rule .
Parsing [sent. 8973 len. 41]: They go down the shaft , stand their watch , come up again , are searched , and go to bed or to their amusements in the compound ; and this routine they repeat , day in and day out .
Parsing [sent. 8974 len. 13]: It is thought that they do not now steal many diamonds successfully .
Parsing [sent. 8975 len. 26]: They used to swallow them , and find other ways of concealing them , but the white man found ways of beating their various games .
Parsing [sent. 8976 len. 21]: One man cut his leg and shoved a diamond into the wound , but even that project did not succeed .
Parsing [sent. 8977 len. 43]: When they find a fine large diamond they are more likely to report it than to steal it , for in the former case they get a reward , and in the latter they are quite apt to merely get into trouble .
Parsing [sent. 8978 len. 56]: Some years ago , in a mine not owned by the De Beers , a black found what has been claimed to be the largest diamond known to the world 's history ; and , as a reward he was released from service and given a blanket , a horse , and five hundred dollars .
Parsing [sent. 8979 len. 6]: It made him a Vanderbilt .
Parsing [sent. 8980 len. 11]: He could buy four wives , and have money left .
Parsing [sent. 8981 len. 10]: Four wives are an ample support for a native .
Parsing [sent. 8982 len. 18]: With four wives he is wholly independent , and need never do a stroke of work again .
Parsing [sent. 8983 len. 7]: That great diamond weighs 97l carats .
Parsing [sent. 8984 len. 43]: Some say it is as big as a piece of alum , others say it is as large as a bite of rock candy , but the best authorities agree that it is almost exactly the size of a chunk of ice .
Parsing [sent. 8985 len. 14]: But those details are not important ; and in my opinion not trustworthy .
Parsing [sent. 8986 len. 15]: It has a flaw in it , otherwise it would be of incredible value .
Parsing [sent. 8987 len. 13]: As it is , it is held to be worth $ 2,000,000 .
Parsing [sent. 8988 len. 25]: After cutting it ought to be worth from $ 5,000,000 to $ 8,000,000 , therefore persons desiring to save money should buy it now .
Parsing [sent. 8989 len. 17]: It is owned by a syndicate , and apparently there is no satisfactory market for it .
Parsing [sent. 8990 len. 12]: It is earning nothing ; it is eating its head off .
Parsing [sent. 8991 len. 16]: Up to this time it has made nobody rich but the native who found it .
Parsing [sent. 8992 len. 13]: He found it in a mine which was being worked by contract .
Parsing [sent. 8993 len. 29]: That is to say , a company had bought the privilege of taking from the mine 5,000,000 carloads of blue-rock , for a sum down and a royalty .
Parsing [sent. 8994 len. 29]: Their speculation had not paid ; but on the very day that their privilege ran out that native found the $ 2,000,000-diamond and handed it over to them .
Parsing [sent. 8995 len. 11]: Even the diamond culture is not without its romantic episodes .
Parsing [sent. 8996 len. 36]: The Koh-i-Noor is a large diamond , and valuable ; but it can not compete in these matters with three which -- according to legend -- are among the crown trinkets of Portugal and Russia .
Parsing [sent. 8997 len. 24]: One of these is held to be worth $ 20,000,000 ; another , $ 25,000,000 , and the third something over $ 28,000,000 .
Parsing [sent. 8998 len. 41]: Those are truly wonderful diamonds , whether they exist or not ; and yet they are of but little importance by comparison with the one wherewith the Boer wagoner chocked his wheel on that steep grade as heretofore referred to .
Parsing [sent. 8999 len. 33]: In Kimberley I had some conversation with the man who saw the Boer do that -- an incident which had occurred twenty-seven or twenty-eight years before I had my talk with him .
Parsing [sent. 9000 len. 21]: He assured me that that diamond 's value could have been over a billion dollars , but not under it .
Parsing [sent. 9001 len. 23]: I believed him , because he had devoted twenty-seven years to hunting for it , and was in a position to know .
Parsing [sent. 9002 len. 79]: A fitting and interesting finish to an examination of the tedious and laborious and costly processes whereby the diamonds are gotten out of the deeps of the earth and freed from the base stuffs which imprison them is the visit to the De Beers offices in the town of Kimberley , where the result of each day 's mining is brought every day , and , weighed , assorted , valued , and deposited in safes against shipping-day .
Parsing [sent. 9003 len. 47]: An unknown and unaccredited person can not get into that place ; and it seemed apparent from the generous supply of warning and protective and prohibitory signs that were posted all about , that not even the known and accredited can steal diamonds there without inconvenience .
Parsing [sent. 9004 len. 32]: We saw the day 's output -- shining little nests of diamonds , distributed a foot apart , along a counter , each nest reposing upon a sheet of white paper .
Parsing [sent. 9005 len. 10]: That day 's catch was about $ 70,000 worth .
Parsing [sent. 9006 len. 32]: In the course of a year half a ton of diamonds pass under the scales there and sleep on that counter ; the resulting money is $ 18,000,000 or $ 20,000,000 .
Parsing [sent. 9007 len. 6]: Profit , about $ 12,000,000 .
Parsing [sent. 9008 len. 19]: Young girls were doing the sorting -- a nice , clean , dainty , and probably distressing employment .
Parsing [sent. 9009 len. 35]: Every day ducal incomes sift and sparkle through the fingers of those young girls ; yet they go to bed at night as poor as they were when they got up in the morning .
Parsing [sent. 9010 len. 11]: The same thing next day , and all the days .
Parsing [sent. 9011 len. 13]: They are beautiful things , those diamonds , in their native state .
Parsing [sent. 9012 len. 20]: They are of various shapes ; they have flat surfaces , rounded borders , and never a sharp edge .
Parsing [sent. 9013 len. 42]: They are of all colors and shades of color , from dewdrop white to actual black ; and their smooth and rounded surfaces and contours , variety of color , and transparent limpidity make them look like piles of assorted candies .
Parsing [sent. 9014 len. 10]: A very light straw color is their commonest tint .
Parsing [sent. 9015 len. 35]: It seemed to me that these uncut gems must be more beautiful than any cut ones could be ; but when a collection of cut ones was brought out , I saw my mistake .
Parsing [sent. 9016 len. 39]: Nothing is so beautiful as a rose diamond with the light playing through it , except that uncostly thing which is just like it -- wavy sea-water with the sunlight playing through it and striking a white-sand bottom .
Parsing [sent. 9017 len. 18]: Before the middle of July we reached Cape Town , and the end of our African journeyings .
Parsing [sent. 9018 len. 35]: And well satisfied ; for , towering above us was Table Mountain -- a reminder that we had now seen each and all of the great features of South Africa except Mr. Cecil Rhodes .
Parsing [sent. 9019 len. 9]: I realize that that is a large exception .
Parsing [sent. 9020 len. 52]: I know quite well that whether Mr. Rhodes is the lofty and worshipful patriot and statesman that multitudes believe him to be , or Satan come again , as the rest of the world account him , he is still the most imposing figure in the British empire outside of England .
Parsing [sent. 9021 len. 17]: When he stands on the Cape of Good Hope , his shadow falls to the Zambesi .
Parsing [sent. 9022 len. 58]: He is the only colonial in the British dominions whose goings and comings are chronicled and discussed under all the globe 's meridians , and whose speeches , unclipped , are cabled from the ends of the earth ; and he is the only unroyal outsider whose arrival in London can compete for attention with an eclipse .
Parsing [sent. 9023 len. 34]: That he is an extraordinary man , and not an accident of fortune , not even his dearest South African enemies were willing to deny , so far as I heard them testify .
Parsing [sent. 9024 len. 22]: The whole South African world seemed to stand in a kind of shuddering awe of him , friend and enemy alike .
Parsing [sent. 9025 len. 59]: It was as if he were deputy-God on the one side , deputy-Satan on the other , proprietor of the people , able to make them or ruin them by his breath , worshiped by many , hated by many , but blasphemed by none among the judicious , and even by the indiscreet in guarded whispers only .
Parsing [sent. 9026 len. 9]: What is the secret of his formidable supremacy ?
Parsing [sent. 9027 len. 165]: One says it is his prodigious wealth -- a wealth whose drippings in salaries and in other ways support multitudes and make them his interested and loyal vassals ; another says it is his personal magnetism and his persuasive tongue , and that these hypnotize and make happy slaves of all that drift within the circle of their influence ; another says it is his majestic ideas , his vast schemes for the territorial aggrandizement of England , his patriotic and unselfish ambition to spread her beneficent protection and her just rule over the pagan wastes of Africa and make luminous the African darkness with the glory of her name ; and another says he wants the earth and wants it for his own , and that the belief that he will get it and let his friends in on the ground floor is the secret that rivets so many eyes upon him and keeps him in the zenith where the view is unobstructed .
Parsing [sent. 9028 len. 6]: One may take his choice .
Parsing [sent. 9029 len. 7]: They are all the same price .
Parsing [sent. 9030 len. 20]: One fact is sure : he keeps his prominence and a vast following , no matter what he does .
Parsing [sent. 9031 len. 28]: He `` deceives '' the Duke of Fife -- it is the Duke 's word -- but that does not destroy the Duke 's loyalty to him .
Parsing [sent. 9032 len. 21]: He tricks the Reformers into immense trouble with his Raid , but the most of them believe he meant well .
Parsing [sent. 9033 len. 49]: He weeps over the harshly-taxed Johannesburgers and makes them his friends ; at the same time he taxes his Charter-settlers 50 per cent. , and so wins their affection and their confidence that they are squelched with despair at every rumor that the Charter is to be annulled .
Parsing [sent. 9034 len. 19]: He raids and robs and slays and enslaves the Matabele and gets worlds of Charter-Christian applause for it .
Parsing [sent. 9035 len. 34]: He has beguiled England into buying Charter waste paper for Bank of England notes , ton for ton , and the ravished still burn incense to him as the Eventual God of Plenty .
Parsing [sent. 9036 len. 84]: He has done everything he could think of to pull himself down to the ground ; he has done more than enough to pull sixteen common-run great men down ; yet there he stands , to this day , upon his dizzy summit under the dome of the sky , an apparent permanency , the marvel of the time , the mystery of the age , an Archangel with wings to half the world , Satan with a tail to the other half .
Parsing [sent. 9037 len. 26]: I admire him , I frankly confess it ; and when his time comes I shall buy a piece of the rope for a keepsake .
Parsing [sent. 9038 len. 2]: CONCLUSION .
Parsing [sent. 9039 len. 22]: I have traveled more than anyone else , and I have noticed that even the angels speak English with an accent .
Parsing [sent. 9040 len. 9]: -- Pudd ` nhead Wilson 's New Calendar .
Parsing [sent. 9041 len. 11]: I saw Table Rock , anyway -- a majestic pile .
Parsing [sent. 9042 len. 6]: It is 3,000 feet high .
Parsing [sent. 9043 len. 7]: It is also 17,000 feet high .
Parsing [sent. 9044 len. 7]: These figures may be relied upon .
Parsing [sent. 9045 len. 24]: I got them in Cape Town from the two best-informed citizens , men who had made Table Rock the study of their lives .
Parsing [sent. 9046 len. 12]: And I saw Table Bay , so named for its levelness .
Parsing [sent. 9047 len. 35]: I saw the Castle -- built by the Dutch East India Company three hundred years ago -- where the Commanding General lives ; I saw St. Simon 's Bay , where the Admiral lives .
Parsing [sent. 9048 len. 25]: I saw the Government , also the Parliament , where they quarreled in two languages when I was there , and agreed in none .
Parsing [sent. 9049 len. 5]: I saw the club .
Parsing [sent. 9050 len. 52]: I saw and explored the beautiful sea-girt drives that wind about the mountains and through the paradise where the villas are : Also I saw some of the fine old Dutch mansions , pleasant homes of the early times , pleasant homes to-day , and enjoyed the privilege of their hospitalities .
Parsing [sent. 9051 len. 43]: And just before I sailed I saw in one of them a quaint old picture which was a link in a curious romance -- a picture of a pale , intellectual young man in a pink coat with a high black collar .
Parsing [sent. 9052 len. 25]: It was a portrait of Dr. James Barry , a military surgeon who came out to the Cape fifty years ago with his regiment .
Parsing [sent. 9053 len. 16]: He was a wild young fellow , and was guilty of various kinds of misbehavior .
Parsing [sent. 9054 len. 52]: He was several times reported to headquarters in England , and it was in each case expected that orders would come out to deal with him promptly and severely , but for some mysterious reason no orders of any kind ever came back -- nothing came but just an impressive silence .
Parsing [sent. 9055 len. 12]: This made him an imposing and uncanny wonder to the town .
Parsing [sent. 9056 len. 9]: Next , he was promoted -- away up .
Parsing [sent. 9057 len. 12]: He was made Medical Superintendent General , and transferred to India .
Parsing [sent. 9058 len. 15]: Presently he was back at the Cape again and at his escapades once more .
Parsing [sent. 9059 len. 32]: There were plenty of pretty girls , but none of them caught him , none of them could get hold of his heart ; evidently he was not a marrying man .
Parsing [sent. 9060 len. 17]: And that was another marvel , another puzzle , and made no end of perplexed talk .
Parsing [sent. 9061 len. 27]: Once he was called in the night , an obstetric service , to do what he could for a woman who was believed to be dying .
Parsing [sent. 9062 len. 13]: He was prompt and scientific , and saved both mother and child .
Parsing [sent. 9063 len. 30]: There are other instances of record which testify to his mastership of his profession ; and many which testify to his love of it and his devotion to it .
Parsing [sent. 9064 len. 21]: Among other adventures of his was a duel of a desperate sort , fought with swords , at the Castle .
Parsing [sent. 9065 len. 5]: He killed his man .
Parsing [sent. 9066 len. 27]: The child heretofore mentioned as having been saved by Dr. Barry so long ago , was named for him , and still lives in Cape Town .
Parsing [sent. 9067 len. 34]: He had Dr. Barry 's portrait painted , and gave it to the gentleman in whose old Dutch house I saw it -- the quaint figure in pink coat and high black collar .
Parsing [sent. 9068 len. 8]: The story seems to be arriving nowhere .
Parsing [sent. 9069 len. 9]: But that is because I have not finished .
Parsing [sent. 9070 len. 10]: Dr. Barry died in Cape Town 30 years ago .
Parsing [sent. 9071 len. 10]: It was then discovered that he was A WOMAN .
Parsing [sent. 9072 len. 46]: The legend goes that enquiries -- soon silenced -- developed the fact that she was a daughter of a great English house , and that that was why her Cape wildnesses brought no punishment and got no notice when reported to the government at home .
Parsing [sent. 9073 len. 6]: Her name was an alias .
Parsing [sent. 9074 len. 27]: She had disgraced herself with her people ; so she chose to change her name and her sex and take a new start in the world .

Parsing [sent. 9076 len. 16]: The voyage to England occupied a short fortnight , without a stop except at Madeira .

Parsing [sent. 9083 len. 22]: Human pride is not worth while ; there is always something lying in wait to take the wind out of it .
