Parsing [sent. 1 len. 28]: THE GUEST OF QUESNAY BY BOOTH TARKINGTON ILLUSTRATED NEW YORK 1915 TO OVID BUTLER JAMESON LIST OF ILLUSTRATIONS Several pairs of brighter eyes followed my companion ... .
Parsing [sent. 2 len. 9]: Frontispiece `` I have n't had my life .
Parsing [sent. 3 len. 5]: It 's gone ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4 len. 16]: `` You and Miss Ward are old and dear friends , are n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5 len. 6]: `` Embrasse moi , Larrabi !
Parsing [sent. 6 len. 4]: Embrasse moi ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7 len. 71]: she cried CHAPTER I There are old Parisians who will tell you pompously that the boulevards , like the political cafes , have ceased to exist , but this means only that the boulevards no longer gossip of Louis Napoleon , the Return of the Bourbons , or of General Boulanger , for these highways are always too busily stirring with present movements not to be forgetful of their yesterdays .
Parsing [sent. 8 len. 78]: In the shade of the buildings and awnings , the loungers , the lookers-on in Paris , the audience of the boulevard , sit at little tables , sipping coffee from long glasses , drinking absinthe or bright - coloured sirops , and gazing over the heads of throngs afoot at others borne along through the sunshine of the street in carriages , in cabs , in glittering automobiles , or high on the tops of omnibuses .
Parsing [sent. 9 len. 147]: From all the continents the multitudes come to join in that procession : Americans , tagged with race-cards and intending hilarious disturbances ; puzzled Americans , worn with guide-book plodding ; Chinese princes in silk ; queer Antillean dandies of swarthy origin and fortune ; ruddy English , thinking of nothing ; pallid English , with upper teeth bared and eyes hungrily searching for sign-boards of tea-rooms ; over-Europeanised Japanese , unpleasantly immaculate ; burnoosed sheiks from the desert , and red-fezzed Semitic peddlers ; Italian nobles in English tweeds ; Soudanese negroes swaggering in frock coats ; slim Spaniards , squat Turks , travellers , idlers , exiles , fugitives , sportsmen -- all the tribes and kinds of men are tributary here to the Parisian stream which , on a fair day in spring , already overflows the banks with its own much-mingled waters .
Parsing [sent. 10 len. 125]: Soberly clad burgesses , bearded , amiable , and in no fatal hurry ; well-kept men of the world swirling by in miraculous limousines ; legless cripples flopping on hands and leather pads ; thin-whiskered students in velveteen ; walrus-moustached veterans in broadcloth ; keen-faced old prelates ; shabby young priests ; cavalrymen in casque and cuirass ; workingmen turned horse and harnessed to carts ; sidewalk jesters , itinerant vendors of questionable wares ; shady loafers dressed to resemble gold-showering America ; motor-cyclists in leather ; hairy musicians , blue gendarmes , baggy red zouaves ; purple-faced , glazed - hatted , scarlet-waistcoated , cigarette-smoking cabmen , calling one another `` onions , '' `` camels , '' and names even more terrible .
Parsing [sent. 11 len. 31]: Women prevalent over all the concourse ; fair women , dark women , pretty women , gilded women , haughty women , indifferent women , friendly women , merry women .
Parsing [sent. 12 len. 18]: Fine women in fine clothes ; rich women in fine clothes ; poor women in fine clothes .
Parsing [sent. 13 len. 20]: Worldly old women , reclining befurred in electric landaulettes ; wordy old women hoydenishly trundling carts full of flowers .
Parsing [sent. 14 len. 15]: Wonderful automobile women quick-glimpsed , in multiple veils of white and brown and sea-green .
Parsing [sent. 15 len. 29]: Women in rags and tags , and women draped , coifed , and befrilled in the delirium of maddened poet-milliners and the hasheesh dreams of ladies ' tailors .
Parsing [sent. 16 len. 56]: About the procession , as it moves interminably along the boulevard , a blue haze of fine dust and burnt gasoline rises into the sunshine like the haze over the passages to an amphitheatre toward which a crowd is trampling ; and through this the multitudes seem to go as actors passing to their cues .
Parsing [sent. 17 len. 92]: Your place at one of the little tables upon the sidewalk is that of a wayside spectator : and as the performers go by , in some measure acting or looking their parts already , as if in preparation , you guess the roles they play , and name them comedians , tragedians , buffoons , saints , beauties , sots , knaves , gladiators , acrobats , dancers ; for all of these are there , and you distinguish the principles from the unnumbered supernumeraries pressing forward to the entrances .
Parsing [sent. 18 len. 81]: So , if you sit at the little tables often enough -- that is , if you become an amateur boulevardier -- you begin to recognise the transient stars of the pageant , those to whom the boulevard allows a dubious and fugitive role of celebrity , and whom it greets with a slight flutter : the turning of heads , a murmur of comment , and the incredulous boulevard smile , which seems to say : `` You see ?
Parsing [sent. 19 len. 16]: Madame and monsieur passing there -- evidently they think we still believe in them ! ''
Parsing [sent. 20 len. 40]: This flutter heralded and followed the passing of a white touring-car with the procession one afternoon , just before the Grand Prix , though it needed no boulevard celebrity to make the man who lolled in the tonneau conspicuous .
Parsing [sent. 21 len. 47]: Simply for THAT , notoriety was superfluous ; so were the remarkable size and power of his car ; so was the elaborate touring - costume of flannels and pongee he wore ; so was even the enamelled presence of the dancer who sat beside him .
Parsing [sent. 22 len. 9]: His face would have done it without accessories .
Parsing [sent. 23 len. 36]: My old friend , George Ward , and I had met for our aperitif at the Terrace Larue , by the Madeleine , when the white automobile came snaking its way craftily through the traffic .
Parsing [sent. 24 len. 43]: Turning in to pass a victoria on the wrong side , it was forced down to a snail 's pace near the curb and not far from our table , where it paused , checked by a blockade at the next corner .
Parsing [sent. 25 len. 21]: I heard Ward utter a half-suppressed guttural of what I took to be amazement , and I did not wonder .
Parsing [sent. 26 len. 31]: The face of the man in the tonneau detached him to the spectator 's gaze and singled him out of the concourse with an effect almost ludicrous in its incongruity .
Parsing [sent. 27 len. 54]: The hair was dark , lustrous and thick , the forehead broad and finely modelled , and certain other ruinous vestiges of youth and good looks remained ; but whatever the features might once have shown of honour , worth , or kindly semblance had disappeared beyond all tracing in a blurred distortion .
Parsing [sent. 28 len. 45]: The lids of one eye were discoloured and swollen almost together ; other traces of a recent battering were not lacking , nor was cosmetic evidence of a heroic struggle , on the part of some valet of infinite pains , to efface them .
Parsing [sent. 29 len. 29]: The nose lost outline in the discolorations of the puffed cheeks ; the chin , tufted with a small imperial , trembled beneath a sagging , gray lip .
Parsing [sent. 30 len. 32]: And that this bruised and dissipated mask should suffer the final grotesque touch , it was decorated with the moustache of a coquettish marquis , the ends waxed and exquisitely elevated .
Parsing [sent. 31 len. 50]: The figure was fat , but loose and sprawling , seemingly without the will to hold itself together ; in truth the man appeared to be almost in a semi-stupor , and , contrasted with this powdered Silenus , even the woman beside him gained something of human dignity .
Parsing [sent. 32 len. 27]: At least , she was thoroughly alive , bold , predatory , and in spite of the gross embon-point that threatened her , still savagely graceful .
Parsing [sent. 33 len. 27]: A purple veil , dotted with gold , floated about her hat , from which green-dyed ostrich plumes cascaded down across a cheek enamelled dead white .
Parsing [sent. 34 len. 72]: Her hair was plastered in blue-black waves , parted low on the forehead ; her lips were splashed a startling carmine , the eyelids painted blue ; and , from between lashes gummed into little spikes of blacking , she favoured her companion with a glance of carelessly simulated tenderness , -- a look all too vividly suggesting the ghastly calculations of a cook wheedling a chicken nearer the kitchen door .
Parsing [sent. 35 len. 10]: But I felt no great pity for the victim .
Parsing [sent. 36 len. 6]: `` Who is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 37 len. 16]: I asked , staring at the man in the automobile and not turning toward Ward .
Parsing [sent. 38 len. 52]: `` That is Mariana -- ` la bella Mariana la Mursiana , ' '' George answered ; '' -- one of those women who come to Paris from the tropics to form themselves on the legend of the one great famous and infamous Spanish dancer who died a long while ago .
Parsing [sent. 39 len. 8]: Mariana did very well for a time .
Parsing [sent. 40 len. 28]: I 've heard that the revolutionary societies intend striking medals in her honour : she 's done worse things to royalty than all the anarchists in Europe !
Parsing [sent. 41 len. 46]: But her great days are over : she 's getting old ; that type goes to pieces quickly , once it begins to slump , and it wo n't be long before she 'll be horribly fat , though she 's still a graceful dancer .
Parsing [sent. 42 len. 10]: She danced at the Folie Rouge last week . ''
Parsing [sent. 43 len. 11]: `` Thank you , George , '' I said gratefully .
Parsing [sent. 44 len. 18]: `` I hope you 'll point out the Louvre and the Eiffel Tower to me some day .
Parsing [sent. 45 len. 7]: I did n't mean Mariana . ''
Parsing [sent. 46 len. 7]: `` What did you mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 47 len. 16]: What I had meant was so obvious that I turned to my friend in surprise .
Parsing [sent. 48 len. 23]: He was nervously tapping his chin with the handle of his cane and staring at the white automobile with very grim interest .
Parsing [sent. 49 len. 12]: `` I meant the man with her , '' I said .
Parsing [sent. 50 len. 4]: `` Oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 51 len. 4]: He laughed sourly .
Parsing [sent. 52 len. 5]: `` That carrion ? ''
Parsing [sent. 53 len. 9]: `` You seem to be an acquaintance . ''
Parsing [sent. 54 len. 25]: `` Everybody on the boulevard knows who he is , '' said Ward curtly , paused , and laughed again with very little mirth .
Parsing [sent. 55 len. 55]: `` So do you , '' he continued ; `` and as for my acquaintance with him -- yes , I had once the distinction of being his rival in a small way , a way so small , in fact , that it ended in his becoming a connection of mine by marriage .
Parsing [sent. 56 len. 6]: He 's Larrabee Harman . ''
Parsing [sent. 57 len. 21]: That was a name somewhat familiar to readers of American newspapers even before its bearer was fairly out of college .
Parsing [sent. 58 len. 27]: The publicity it then attained -LRB- partly due to young Harman 's conspicuous wealth -RRB- attached to some youthful exploits not without a certain wild humour .
Parsing [sent. 59 len. 42]: But frolic degenerated into brawl and debauch : what had been scrapes for the boy became scandals for the man ; and he gathered a more and more unsavoury reputation until its like was not to be found outside a penitentiary .
Parsing [sent. 60 len. 24]: The crux of his career in his own country was reached during a midnight quarrel in Chicago when he shot a negro gambler .
Parsing [sent. 61 len. 36]: After that , the negro having recovered and the matter being somehow arranged so that the prosecution was dropped , Harman 's wife left him , and the papers recorded her application for a divorce .
Parsing [sent. 62 len. 36]: She was George Ward 's second cousin , the daughter of a Baltimore clergyman ; a belle in a season and town of belles , and a delightful , headstrong creature , from all accounts .
Parsing [sent. 63 len. 46]: She had made a runaway match of it with Harman three years before , their affair having been earnestly opposed by all her relatives -- especially by poor George , who came over to Paris just after the wedding in a miserable frame of mind .
Parsing [sent. 64 len. 14]: The Chicago exploit was by no means the end of Harman 's notoriety .
Parsing [sent. 65 len. 72]: Evading an effort -LRB- on the part of an aunt , I believe -RRB- to get him locked up safely in a `` sanitarium , '' he began a trip round the world with an orgy which continued from San Francisco to Bangkok , where , in the company of some congenial fellow travellers , he interfered in a native ceremonial with the result that one of his companions was drowned .
Parsing [sent. 66 len. 23]: Proceeding , he was reported to be in serious trouble at Constantinople , the result of an inquisitiveness little appreciated by Orientals .
Parsing [sent. 67 len. 21]: The State Department , bestirring itself , saved him from a very real peril , and he continued his journey .
Parsing [sent. 68 len. 33]: In Rome he was rescued with difficulty from a street mob that unreasonably refused to accept intoxication as an excuse for his riding down a child on his way to the hunt .
Parsing [sent. 69 len. 29]: Later , during the winter just past , we had been hearing from Monte Carlo of his disastrous plunges at that most imbecile of all games , roulette .
Parsing [sent. 70 len. 35]: Every event , no matter how trifling , in this man 's pitiful career had been recorded in the American newspapers with an elaboration which , for my part , I found infuriatingly tiresome .
Parsing [sent. 71 len. 47]: I have lived in Paris so long that I am afraid to go home : I have too little to show for my years of pottering with paint and canvas , and I have grown timid about all the changes that have crept in at home .
Parsing [sent. 72 len. 53]: I do not know the `` new men , '' I do not know how they would use me , and fear they might make no place for me ; and so I fit myself more closely into the little grooves I have worn for myself , and resign myself to stay .
Parsing [sent. 73 len. 8]: But I am no `` expatriate . ''
Parsing [sent. 74 len. 33]: I know there is a feeling at home against us who remain over here to do our work , but in most instances it is a prejudice which springs from a misunderstanding .
Parsing [sent. 75 len. 51]: I think the quality of patriotism in those of us who `` did n't go home in time '' is almost pathetically deep and real , and , like many another oldish fellow in my position , I try to keep as close to things at home as I can .
Parsing [sent. 76 len. 64]: All of my old friends gradually ceased to write to me , but I still take three home newspapers , trying to follow the people I knew and the things that happen ; and the ubiquity of so worthless a creature as Larrabee Harman in the columns I dredged for real news had long been a point of irritation to this present exile .
Parsing [sent. 77 len. 52]: Not only that : he had usurped space in the Continental papers , and of late my favourite Parisian journal had served him to me with my morning coffee , only hinting his name , but offering him with that gracious satire characteristic of the Gallic journalist writing of anything American .
Parsing [sent. 78 len. 20]: And so this grotesque wreck of a man was well known to the boulevard -- one of its sights .
Parsing [sent. 79 len. 32]: That was to be perceived by the flutter he caused , by the turning of heads in his direction , and the low laughter of the people at the little tables .
Parsing [sent. 80 len. 23]: Three or four in the rear ranks had risen to their feet to get a better look at him and his companion .
Parsing [sent. 81 len. 7]: Some one behind us chuckled aloud .
Parsing [sent. 82 len. 8]: `` They say Mariana beats him . ''
Parsing [sent. 83 len. 4]: `` Evidently ! ''
Parsing [sent. 84 len. 32]: The dancer was aware of the flutter , and called Harman 's attention to it with a touch upon his arm and a laugh and a nod of her violent plumage .
Parsing [sent. 85 len. 42]: At that he seemed to rouse himself somewhat : his head rolled heavily over upon his shoulder , the lids lifted a little from the red-shot eyes , showing a strange pride when his gaze fell upon the many staring faces .
Parsing [sent. 86 len. 46]: Then , as the procession moved again and the white automobile with it , the sottish mouth widened in a smile of dull and cynical contempt : the look of a half-poisoned Augustan borne down through the crowds from the Palatine after supping with Caligula .
Parsing [sent. 87 len. 5]: Ward pulled my sleeve .
Parsing [sent. 88 len. 23]: `` Come , '' he said , `` let us go over to the Luxembourg gardens where the air is cleaner . ''
Parsing [sent. 89 len. 25]: CHAPTER II Ward is a portrait-painter , and in the matter of vogue there seem to be no pinnacles left for him to surmount .
Parsing [sent. 90 len. 61]: I think he has painted most of the very rich women of fashion who have come to Paris of late years , and he has become so prosperous , has such a polite celebrity , and his opinions upon art are so conclusively quoted , that the friendship of some of us who started with him has been dangerously strained .
Parsing [sent. 91 len. 15]: He lives a well-ordered life ; he has always led that kind of life .
Parsing [sent. 92 len. 32]: Even in his student days when I first knew him , I do not remember an occasion upon which the principal of a New England high-school would have criticised his conduct .
Parsing [sent. 93 len. 31]: And yet I never heard anyone call him a prig ; and , so far as I know , no one was ever so stupid as to think him one .
Parsing [sent. 94 len. 29]: He was a quiet , good-looking , well-dressed boy , and he matured into a somewhat reserved , well-poised man , of impressive distinction in appearance and manner .
Parsing [sent. 95 len. 33]: He has always been well tended and cared for by women ; in his student days his mother lived with him ; his sister , Miss Elizabeth , looks after him now .
Parsing [sent. 96 len. 70]: She came with him when he returned to Paris after his disappointment in the unfortunate Harman affair , and she took charge of all his business -- as well as his social -- arrangements -LRB- she has been accused of a theory that the two things may be happily combined -RRB- , making him lease a house in an expensively modish quarter near the Avenue du Bois de Boulogne .
Parsing [sent. 97 len. 26]: Miss Elizabeth is an instinctively fashionable woman , practical withal , and to her mind success should be not only respectable but `` smart . ''
Parsing [sent. 98 len. 35]: She does not speak of the `` right bank '' and the `` left bank '' of the Seine ; she calls them the `` right bank '' and the `` wrong bank . ''
Parsing [sent. 99 len. 75]: And yet , though she removed George -LRB- her word is `` rescued '' -RRB- from many of his old associations with Montparnasse , she warmly encouraged my friendship with him -- yea , in spite of my living so deep in the wrong bank that the first time he brought her to my studio , she declared she had n't seen anything so like Bring-the-child-to-the - old-hag 's - cellar-at-midnight since her childhood .
Parsing [sent. 100 len. 32]: She is a handsome woman , large , and of a fine , high colour ; her manner is gaily dictatorial , and she and I got along very well together .
Parsing [sent. 101 len. 20]: Probably she appreciated my going to some pains with the clothes I wore when I went to their house .
Parsing [sent. 102 len. 47]: My visits there were infrequent , not because I had any fear of wearing out a welcome , but on account of Miss Elizabeth 's `` day , '' when I could see nothing of George for the crowd of lionising women and time-wasters about him .
Parsing [sent. 103 len. 95]: Her `` day '' was a dread of mine ; I could seldom remember which day it was , and when I did she had a way of shifting it so that I was fatally sure to run into it -- to my misery , for , beginning with those primordial indignities suffered in youth , when I was scrubbed with a handkerchief outside the parlour door as a preliminary to polite usages , my childhood 's , manhood 's prayer has been : From all such days , Good Lord , deliver me !
Parsing [sent. 104 len. 13]: It was George 's habit to come much oftener to see me .
Parsing [sent. 105 len. 33]: He always really liked the sort of society his sister had brought about him ; but now and then there were intervals when it wore on him a little , I think .
Parsing [sent. 106 len. 45]: Sometimes he came for me in his automobile and we would make a mild excursion to breakfast in the country ; and that is what happened one morning about three weeks after the day when we had sought pure air in the Luxembourg gardens .
Parsing [sent. 107 len. 21]: We drove out through the Bois and by Suresnes , striking into a roundabout road to Versailles beyond St. Cloud .
Parsing [sent. 108 len. 71]: It was June , a dustless and balmy noon , the air thinly gilded by a faint haze , and I know few things pleasanter than that road on a fair day of the early summer and no sweeter way to course it than in an open car ; though I must not be giving myself out for a `` motorist '' -- I have not even the right cap .
Parsing [sent. 109 len. 47]: I am usually nervous in big machines , too ; but Ward has never caught the speed mania and holds a strange power over his chauffeur ; so we rolled along peacefully , not madly , and smoked -LRB- like the car -RRB- in hasteless content .
Parsing [sent. 110 len. 27]: `` After all , '' said George , with a placid wave of the hand , `` I sometimes wish that the landscape had called me .
Parsing [sent. 111 len. 23]: You outdoor men have all the health and pleasure of living in the open , and as for the work -- oh !
Parsing [sent. 112 len. 16]: you fellows think you work , but you do n't know what it means . ''
Parsing [sent. 113 len. 4]: `` No ? ''
Parsing [sent. 114 len. 17]: I said , and smiled as I always meanly do when George `` talks art . ''
Parsing [sent. 115 len. 29]: He was silent for a few moments and then said irritably , `` Well , at least you ca n't deny that the academic crowd can DRAW ! ''
Parsing [sent. 116 len. 54]: Never having denied it , though he had challenged me in the same way perhaps a thousand times , I refused to deny it now ; whereupon he returned to his theme : `` Landscape is about as simple as a stage fight ; two up , two down , cross and repeat .
Parsing [sent. 117 len. 6]: Take that ahead of us .
Parsing [sent. 118 len. 8]: Could anything be simpler to paint ? ''
Parsing [sent. 119 len. 26]: He indicated the white road running before us between open fields to a curve , where it descended to pass beneath an old stone culvert .
Parsing [sent. 120 len. 15]: Beyond , stood a thick grove with a clear sky flickering among the branches .
Parsing [sent. 121 len. 21]: An old peasant woman was pushing a heavy cart round the curve , a scarlet handkerchief knotted about her head .
Parsing [sent. 122 len. 8]: `` You think it 's easy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 123 len. 3]: I asked .
Parsing [sent. 124 len. 3]: `` Easy !
Parsing [sent. 125 len. 25]: Two hours ought to do it as well as it could be done -- at least , the way you fellows do it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 126 len. 15]: He clenched his fingers as if upon the handle of a house-painter 's brush .
Parsing [sent. 127 len. 11]: `` Slap , dash -- there 's your road . ''
Parsing [sent. 128 len. 17]: He paddled the air with the imaginary brush as though painting the side of a barn .
Parsing [sent. 129 len. 14]: `` Swish , swash -- there go your fields and your stone bridge .
Parsing [sent. 130 len. 2]: Fit !
Parsing [sent. 131 len. 2]: Speck !
Parsing [sent. 132 len. 27]: And there 's your old woman , her red handkerchief , and what your dealer will probably call ` the human interest , ' all complete .
Parsing [sent. 133 len. 11]: Squirt the edges of your foliage in with a blow-pipe .
Parsing [sent. 134 len. 15]: Throw a cup of tea over the whole , and there 's your haze .
Parsing [sent. 135 len. 22]: Call it ` The Golden Road , ' or ` The Bath of Sunlight , ' or ` Quiet Noon . '
Parsing [sent. 136 len. 47]: Then you 'll probably get a criticism beginning , ` Few indeed have more intangibly detained upon canvas so poetic a quality of sentiment as this sterling landscapist , who in Number 136 has most ethereally expressed the profound silence of evening on an English moor .
Parsing [sent. 137 len. 72]: The solemn hush , the brooding quiet , the homeward ploughman -- ' '' He was interrupted by an outrageous uproar , the grisly scream of a siren and the cannonade of a powerful exhaust , as a great white touring-car swung round us from behind at a speed that sickened me to see , and , snorting thunder , passed us `` as if we had been standing still . ''
Parsing [sent. 138 len. 20]: It hurtled like a comet down the curve and we were instantly choking in its swirling tail of dust .
Parsing [sent. 139 len. 7]: `` Seventy miles an hour ! ''
Parsing [sent. 140 len. 8]: gasped George , swabbing at his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 141 len. 15]: `` Those are the fellows that get into the pa -- Oh , Lord !
Parsing [sent. 142 len. 5]: THERE they go ! ''
Parsing [sent. 143 len. 39]: Swinging out to pass us and then sweeping in upon the reverse curve to clear the narrow arch of the culvert were too much for the white car ; and through the dust we saw it rock dangerously .
Parsing [sent. 144 len. 27]: In the middle of the road , ten feet from the culvert , the old woman struggled frantically to get her cart out of the way .
Parsing [sent. 145 len. 21]: The howl of the siren frightened her perhaps , for she lost her head and went to the wrong side .
Parsing [sent. 146 len. 15]: Then the shriek of the machine drowned the human scream as the automobile struck .
Parsing [sent. 147 len. 7]: The shock of contact was muffled .
Parsing [sent. 148 len. 27]: But the mass of machinery hoisted itself in the air as if it had a life of its own and had been stung into sudden madness .
Parsing [sent. 149 len. 48]: It was horrible to see , and so grotesque that a long - forgotten memory of my boyhood leaped instantaneously into my mind , a recollection of the evolutions performed by a Newfoundland dog that rooted under a board walk and found a hive of wild bees .
Parsing [sent. 150 len. 66]: The great machine left the road for the fields on the right , reared , fell , leaped against the stone side of the culvert , apparently trying to climb it , stood straight on end , whirled backward in a half-somersault , crashed over on its side , flashed with flame and explosion , and lay hidden under a cloud of dust and smoke .
Parsing [sent. 151 len. 31]: Ward 's driver slammed down his accelerator , sent us spinning round the curve , and the next moment , throwing on his brakes , halted sharply at the culvert .
Parsing [sent. 152 len. 33]: The fabric of the road was so torn and distorted one might have thought a steam dredge had begun work there , but the fragments of wreckage were oddly isolated and inconspicuous .
Parsing [sent. 153 len. 30]: The peasant 's cart , tossed into a clump of weeds , rested on its side , the spokes of a rimless wheel slowly revolving on the hub uppermost .
Parsing [sent. 154 len. 51]: Some tools were strewn in a semi - circular trail in the dust ; a pair of smashed goggles crunched beneath my foot as I sprang out of Ward 's car , and a big brass lamp had fallen in the middle of the road , crumpled like waste paper .
Parsing [sent. 155 len. 8]: Beside it lay a gold rouge box .
Parsing [sent. 156 len. 33]: The old woman had somehow saved herself -- or perhaps her saint had helped her -- for she was sitting in the grass by the roadside , wailing hysterically and quite unhurt .
Parsing [sent. 157 len. 31]: The body of a man lay in a heap beneath the stone archway , and from his clothes I guessed that he had been the driver of the white car .
Parsing [sent. 158 len. 23]: I say `` had been '' because there were reasons for needing no second glance to comprehend that the man was dead .
Parsing [sent. 159 len. 21]: Nevertheless , I knelt beside him and placed my hand upon his breast to see if his heart still beat .
Parsing [sent. 160 len. 44]: Afterward I concluded that I did this because I had seen it done upon the stage , or had read of it in stories ; and even at the time I realised that it was a silly thing for me to be doing .
Parsing [sent. 161 len. 8]: Ward , meanwhile , proved more practical .
Parsing [sent. 162 len. 42]: He was dragging a woman out of the suffocating smoke and dust that shrouded the wreck , and after a moment I went to help him carry her into the fresh air , where George put his coat under her head .
Parsing [sent. 163 len. 63]: Her hat had been forced forward over her face and held there by the twisting of a system of veils she wore ; and we had some difficulty in unravelling this ; but she was very much alive , as a series of muffled imprecations testified , leading us to conclude that her sufferings were more profoundly of rage than of pain .
Parsing [sent. 164 len. 25]: Finally she pushed our hands angrily aside and completed the untanglement herself , revealing the scratched and smeared face of Mariana , the dancer .
Parsing [sent. 165 len. 3]: `` Cornichon !
Parsing [sent. 166 len. 2]: Chameau !
Parsing [sent. 167 len. 5]: Fond du bain ! ''
Parsing [sent. 168 len. 11]: she gasped , tears of anger starting from her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 169 len. 17]: She tried to rise before we could help her , but dropped back with a scream .
Parsing [sent. 170 len. 7]: `` Oh , the pain ! ''
Parsing [sent. 171 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 172 len. 4]: `` That imbecile !
Parsing [sent. 173 len. 9]: If he has let me break my leg !
Parsing [sent. 174 len. 7]: A pretty dancer I should be !
Parsing [sent. 175 len. 7]: I hope he is killed . ''
Parsing [sent. 176 len. 22]: One of the singularities of motoring on the main-travelled roads near Paris is the prevalence of cars containing physicians and surgeons .
Parsing [sent. 177 len. 83]: Whether it be testimony to the opportunism , to the sporting proclivities , or to the prosperity of gentlemen of those professions , I do not know , but it is a fact that I have never heard of an accident -LRB- and in the season there is an accident every day -RRB- on one of these roads when a doctor in an automobile was not almost immediately a chance arrival , and fortunately our case offered no exception to this rule .
Parsing [sent. 178 len. 13]: Another automobile had already come up and the occupants were hastily alighting .
Parsing [sent. 179 len. 11]: Ward shouted to the foremost to go for a doctor .
Parsing [sent. 180 len. 19]: `` I am a doctor , '' the man answered , advancing and kneeling quickly by the dancer .
Parsing [sent. 181 len. 12]: `` And you -- you may be of help yonder . ''
Parsing [sent. 182 len. 15]: We turned toward the ruined car where Ward 's driver was shouting for us .
Parsing [sent. 183 len. 6]: `` What is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 184 len. 8]: called Ward as we ran toward him .
Parsing [sent. 185 len. 18]: `` Monsieur , '' he replied , `` there is some one under the tonneau here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 186 len. 29]: The smoke had cleared a little , though a rivulet of burning gasoline ran from the wreck to a pool of flame it was feeding in the road .
Parsing [sent. 187 len. 30]: The front cushions and woodwork had caught fire and a couple of labourers , panting with the run across the fields , were vainly belabouring the flames with brushwood .
Parsing [sent. 188 len. 25]: From beneath the overturned tonneau projected the lower part of a man 's leg , clad in a brown puttee and a russet shoe .
Parsing [sent. 189 len. 28]: Ward 's driver had brought his tools ; had jacked up the car as high as possible ; but was still unable to release the imprisoned body .
Parsing [sent. 190 len. 28]: `` I have seized that foot and pulled with all my strength , '' he said , `` and I can not make him move one centimetre .
Parsing [sent. 191 len. 26]: It is necessary that as many people as possible lay hold of the car on the side away from the fire and all lift together .
Parsing [sent. 192 len. 12]: Yes , '' he added , `` and very soon ! ''
Parsing [sent. 193 len. 22]: Some carters had come from the road and one of them lay full length on the ground peering beneath the wreck .
Parsing [sent. 194 len. 27]: `` It is the head of monsieur , '' explained this one ; `` it is the head of monsieur which is fastened under there . ''
Parsing [sent. 195 len. 11]: `` Eh , but you are wiser than Clemenceau ! ''
Parsing [sent. 196 len. 4]: said the chauffeur .
Parsing [sent. 197 len. 31]: `` Get up , my ancient , and you there , with the brushwood , let the fire go for a moment and help , when I say the word .
Parsing [sent. 198 len. 31]: And you , monsieur , '' he turned to Ward , `` if you please , will you pull with me upon the ankle here at the right moment ? ''
Parsing [sent. 199 len. 22]: The carters , the labourers , the men from the other automobile , and I laid hold of the car together .
Parsing [sent. 200 len. 10]: `` Now , then , messieurs , LIFT ! ''
Parsing [sent. 201 len. 9]: Stifled with the gasoline smoke , we obeyed .
Parsing [sent. 202 len. 25]: One or two hands were scorched and our eyes smarted blindingly , but we gave a mighty heave , and felt the car rising .
Parsing [sent. 203 len. 5]: `` Well done ! ''
Parsing [sent. 204 len. 4]: cried the chauffeur .
Parsing [sent. 205 len. 4]: `` Well done !
Parsing [sent. 206 len. 5]: But a little more !
Parsing [sent. 207 len. 6]: The smallest fraction -- HA !
Parsing [sent. 208 len. 7]: It is finished , messieurs ! ''
Parsing [sent. 209 len. 10]: We staggered back , coughing and wiping our eyes .
Parsing [sent. 210 len. 19]: For a minute or two I could not see at all , and was busy with a handkerchief .
Parsing [sent. 211 len. 8]: Ward laid his hand on my shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 212 len. 9]: `` Do you know who it is ? ''
Parsing [sent. 213 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 214 len. 10]: `` Yes , of course , '' I answered .
Parsing [sent. 215 len. 101]: When I could see again , I found that I was looking almost straight down into the upturned face of Larrabee Harman , and I can not better express what this man had come to be , and what the degradation of his life had written upon him , than by saying that the dreadful thing I looked upon now was no more horrible a sight than the face I had seen , fresh from the valet and smiling in ugly pride at the starers , as he passed the terrace of Larue on the day before the Grand Prix .
Parsing [sent. 216 len. 39]: We helped to carry him to the doctor 's car , and to lift the dancer into Ward 's , and to get both of them out again at the hospital at Versailles , where they were taken .
Parsing [sent. 217 len. 36]: Then , with no need to ask each other if we should abandon our plan to breakfast in the country , we turned toward Paris , and rolled along almost to the barriers in silence .
Parsing [sent. 218 len. 28]: `` Did it seem to you , '' said George finally , `` that a man so frightfully injured could have any chance of getting well ? ''
Parsing [sent. 219 len. 7]: `` No , '' I answered .
Parsing [sent. 220 len. 15]: `` I thought he was dying as we carried him into the hospital . ''
Parsing [sent. 221 len. 5]: `` So did I .
Parsing [sent. 222 len. 13]: The top of his head seemed all crushed in -- Whew ! ''
Parsing [sent. 223 len. 11]: He broke off , shivering , and wiped his brow .
Parsing [sent. 224 len. 18]: After a pause he added thoughtfully , `` It will be a great thing for Louise . ''
Parsing [sent. 225 len. 32]: Louise was the name of his second cousin , the girl who had done battle with all her family and then run away from them to be Larrabee Harman 's wife .
Parsing [sent. 226 len. 40]: Remembering the stir that her application for divorce had made , I did not understand how Harman 's death could benefit her , unless George had some reason to believe that he had made a will in her favour .
Parsing [sent. 227 len. 19]: However , the remark had been made more to himself than to me and I did not respond .
Parsing [sent. 228 len. 27]: The morning papers flared once more with the name of Larrabee Harman , and we read that there was `` no hope of his surviving . ''
Parsing [sent. 229 len. 3]: Ironic phrase !
Parsing [sent. 230 len. 33]: There was not a soul on earth that day who could have hoped for his recovery , or who -- for his sake -- cared two straws whether he lived or died .
Parsing [sent. 231 len. 21]: And the dancer had been right ; one of her legs was badly broken : she would never dance again .
Parsing [sent. 232 len. 10]: Evening papers reported that Harman was `` lingering . ''
Parsing [sent. 233 len. 7]: He was lingering the next day .
Parsing [sent. 234 len. 20]: He was lingering the next week , and the end of a month saw him still `` lingering . ''
Parsing [sent. 235 len. 30]: Then I went down to Capri , where -- for he had been after all the merest episode to me -- I was pleased to forget all about him .
Parsing [sent. 236 len. 30]: CHAPTER III A great many people keep their friends in mind by writing to them , but more do not ; and Ward and I belong to the majority .
Parsing [sent. 237 len. 45]: After my departure from Paris I had but one missive from him , a short note , written at the request of his sister , asking me to be on the lookout for Italian earrings , to add to her collection of old jewels .
Parsing [sent. 238 len. 30]: So , from time to time , I sent her what I could find about Capri or in Naples , and she responded with neat little letters of acknowledgment .
Parsing [sent. 239 len. 49]: Two years I stayed on Capri , eating the lotus which grows on that happy island , and painting very little -- only enough , indeed , to be remembered at the Salon and not so much as knowing how kindly or unkindly they hung my pictures there .
Parsing [sent. 240 len. 42]: But even on Capri , people sometimes hear the call of Paris and wish to be in that unending movement : to hear the multitudinous rumble , to watch the procession from a cafe terrace and to dine at Foyot 's .
Parsing [sent. 241 len. 46]: So there came at last a fine day when I , knowing that the horse-chestnuts were in bloom along the Champs Elysees , threw my rope-soled shoes to a beggar , packed a rusty trunk , and was off for the banks of the Seine .
Parsing [sent. 242 len. 27]: My arrival -- just the drive from the Gare de Lyon to my studio -- was like the shock of surf on a bather 's breast .
Parsing [sent. 243 len. 22]: The stir and life , the cheerful energy of the streets , put stir and life and cheerful energy into me .
Parsing [sent. 244 len. 34]: I felt the itch to work again , to be at it , at it in earnest -- to lose no hour of daylight , and to paint better than I had painted !
Parsing [sent. 245 len. 74]: Paris having given me this impetus , I dared not tempt her further , nor allow the edge of my eagerness time to blunt ; therefore , at the end of a fortnight , I went over into Normandy and deposited that rusty trunk of mine in a corner of the summer pavilion in the courtyard of Madame Brossard 's inn , Les Trois Pigeons , in a woodland neighborhood that is there .
Parsing [sent. 246 len. 35]: Here I had painted through a prolific summer of my youth , and I was glad to find -- as I had hoped -- nothing changed ; for the place was dear to me .
Parsing [sent. 247 len. 74]: Madame Brossard -LRB- dark , thin , demure as of yore , a fine - looking woman with a fine manner and much the flavour of old Norman portraits -RRB- gave me a pleasant welcome , remembering me readily but without surprise , while Amedee , the antique servitor , cackled over me and was as proud of my advent as if I had been a new egg and he had laid me .
Parsing [sent. 248 len. 15]: The simile is grotesque ; but Amedee is the most henlike waiter in France .
Parsing [sent. 249 len. 18]: He is a white-haired , fat old fellow , always well-shaved ; as neat as a billiard-ball .
Parsing [sent. 250 len. 74]: In the daytime , when he is partly porter , he wears a black tie , a gray waistcoat broadly striped with scarlet , and , from waist to feet , a white apron like a skirt , and so competently encircling that his trousers are of mere conventionality and no real necessity ; but after six o'clock -LRB- becoming altogether a maitre d'hotel -RRB- he is clad as any other formal gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 251 len. 47]: At all times he wears a fresh table-cloth over his arm , keeping an exaggerated pile of them ready at hand on a ledge in one of the little bowers of the courtyard , so that he may never be shamed by getting caught without one .
Parsing [sent. 252 len. 67]: His conception of life is that all worthy persons were created as receptacles for food and drink ; and five minutes after my arrival he had me seated -LRB- in spite of some meek protests -RRB- in a wicker chair with a pitcher of the right Three Pigeons cider on the table before me , while he subtly dictated what manner of dinner I should eat .
Parsing [sent. 253 len. 28]: For this interval Amedee 's exuberance was sobered and his badinage dismissed as being mere garniture , the questions now before us concerning grave and inward matters .
Parsing [sent. 254 len. 25]: His suggestions were deferential but insistent ; his manner was that of a prime minister who goes through the form of convincing the sovereign .
Parsing [sent. 255 len. 15]: He greeted each of his own decisions with a very loud `` Bien ! ''
Parsing [sent. 256 len. 37]: as if startled by the brilliancy of my selections , and , the menu being concluded , exploded a whole volley of `` Biens '' and set off violently to instruct old Gaston , the cook .
Parsing [sent. 257 len. 17]: That is Amedee 's way ; he always starts violently for anywhere he means to go .
Parsing [sent. 258 len. 84]: He is a little lame and his progress more or less sidelong , but if you call him , or new guests arrive at the inn , or he receives an order from Madame Brossard , he gives the effect of running by a sudden movement of the whole body like that of a man ABOUT to run , and moves off using the gestures of a man who IS running ; after which he proceeds to his destination at an exquisite leisure .
Parsing [sent. 259 len. 18]: Remembering this old habit of his , it was with joy that I noted his headlong departure .
Parsing [sent. 260 len. 59]: Some ten feet of his progress accomplished , he halted -LRB- for no purpose but to scratch his head the more luxuriously -RRB- ; next , strayed from the path to contemplate a rose-bush , and , selecting a leaf with careful deliberation , placed it in his mouth and continued meditatively upon his way to the kitchen .
Parsing [sent. 261 len. 16]: I chuckled within me ; it was good to be back at Madame Brossard 's .
Parsing [sent. 262 len. 36]: The courtyard was more a garden ; bright with rows of flowers in formal little beds and blossoming up from big green tubs , from red jars , and also from two brightly painted wheel-barrows .
Parsing [sent. 263 len. 43]: A long arbour offered a shelter of vines for those who might choose to dine , breakfast , or lounge beneath , and , here and there among the shrubberies , you might come upon a latticed bower , thatched with straw .
Parsing [sent. 264 len. 42]: My own pavilion -LRB- half bedroom , half studio -RRB- was set in the midst of all and had a small porch of its own with a rich curtain of climbing honeysuckle for a screen from the rest of the courtyard .
Parsing [sent. 265 len. 63]: The inn itself is gray with age , the roof sagging pleasantly here and there ; and an old wooden gallery runs the length of each wing , the guest-chambers of the upper story opening upon it like the deck-rooms of a steamer , with boxes of tulips and hyacinths along the gallery railings and window ledges for the gayest of border-lines .
Parsing [sent. 266 len. 69]: Beyond the great open archway , which gives entrance to the courtyard , lies the quiet country road ; passing this , my eyes followed the wide sweep of poppy-sprinkled fields to a line of low green hills ; and there was the edge of the forest sheltering those woodland interiors which I had long ago tried to paint , and where I should be at work to-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 267 len. 30]: In the course of time , and well within the bright twilight , Amedee spread the crisp white cloth and served me at a table on my pavilion porch .
Parsing [sent. 268 len. 67]: He feigned anxiety lest I should find certain dishes -LRB- those which he knew were most delectable -RRB- not to my taste , but was obviously so distended with fatuous pride over the whole meal that it became a temptation to denounce at least some trifling sauce or garnishment ; nevertheless , so much mendacity proved beyond me and I spared him and my own conscience .
Parsing [sent. 269 len. 54]: This puffed-uppedness of his was to be observed only in his expression of manner , for during the consumption of food it was his worthy custom to practise a ceremonious , nay , a reverential , hush , and he never offered -LRB- or approved -RRB- conversation until he had prepared the salad .
Parsing [sent. 270 len. 31]: That accomplished , however , and the water bubbling in the coffee machine , he readily favoured me with a discourse on the decline in glory of Les Trois Pigeons .
Parsing [sent. 271 len. 13]: `` Monsieur , it is the automobiles ; they have done it .
Parsing [sent. 272 len. 14]: Formerly , as when monsieur was here , the painters came from Paris .
Parsing [sent. 273 len. 14]: They would come in the spring and would stay until the autumn rains .
Parsing [sent. 274 len. 7]: What busy times and what drolleries !
Parsing [sent. 275 len. 9]: Ah , it was gay in those days !
Parsing [sent. 276 len. 4]: Monsieur remembers well .
Parsing [sent. 277 len. 4]: Ha , Ha !
Parsing [sent. 278 len. 23]: But now , I think , the automobiles have frightened away the painters ; at least they do not come any more .
Parsing [sent. 279 len. 33]: And the automobiles themselves ; they come sometimes for lunch , a few , but they love better the seashore , and we are just close enough to be too far away .
Parsing [sent. 280 len. 15]: Those automobiles , they love the big new hotels and the casinos with roulette .
Parsing [sent. 281 len. 12]: They eat hastily , gulp down a liqueur , and pouf !
Parsing [sent. 282 len. 14]: off they rush for Trouville , for Houlgate -- for heaven knows where !
Parsing [sent. 283 len. 13]: And even the automobiles do not come so frequently as they did .
Parsing [sent. 284 len. 19]: Our road used to be the best from Lisieux to Beuzeval , but now the maps recommend another .
Parsing [sent. 285 len. 21]: They pass us by , and yet yonder -- only a few kilometres -- is the coast with its thousands .
Parsing [sent. 286 len. 13]: We are near the world but out of it , monsieur . ''
Parsing [sent. 287 len. 26]: He poured my coffee ; dropped a lump of sugar from the tongs with a benevolent gesture -- `` One lump : always the same .
Parsing [sent. 288 len. 10]: Monsieur sees that I remember well , ha ? ''
Parsing [sent. 289 len. 22]: -- and the twilight having fallen , he lit two orange - shaded candles and my cigar with the same match .
Parsing [sent. 290 len. 52]: The night was so quiet that the candle-lights burned as steadily as flames in a globe , yet the air was spiced with a cool fragrance , and through the honeysuckle leaves above me I saw , as I leaned back in my wicker chair , a glimmer of kindly stars .
Parsing [sent. 291 len. 14]: `` Very comfortably out of the world , Amedee , '' I said .
Parsing [sent. 292 len. 13]: `` It seems to me I have it all to myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 293 len. 6]: `` Unhappily , yes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 294 len. 9]: he exclaimed ; then excused himself , chuckling .
Parsing [sent. 295 len. 17]: `` I should have said that we should be happier if we had many like monsieur .
Parsing [sent. 296 len. 10]: But it is early in the season to despair .
Parsing [sent. 297 len. 12]: Then , too , our best suite is already engaged . ''
Parsing [sent. 298 len. 5]: `` By whom ? ''
Parsing [sent. 299 len. 10]: `` Two men of science who arrive next week .
Parsing [sent. 300 len. 6]: One is a great man .
Parsing [sent. 301 len. 22]: Madame Brossard is pleased that he is coming to Les Trois Pigeons , but I tell her it is only natural .
Parsing [sent. 302 len. 29]: He comes now for the first time because he likes the quiet , but he will come again , like monsieur , because he has been here before .
Parsing [sent. 303 len. 19]: That is what I always say : ` Any one who has been here must come again . '
Parsing [sent. 304 len. 13]: The problem is only to get them to come the first time .
Parsing [sent. 305 len. 3]: Truly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 306 len. 10]: `` Who is the great man , Amedee ? ''
Parsing [sent. 307 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 308 len. 6]: A distinguished professor of science .
Parsing [sent. 309 len. 3]: Truly . ''
Parsing [sent. 310 len. 5]: `` What science ? ''
Parsing [sent. 311 len. 6]: `` I do not know .
Parsing [sent. 312 len. 9]: But he is a member of the Institute .
Parsing [sent. 313 len. 11]: Monsieur must have heard of that great Professor Keredec ? ''
Parsing [sent. 314 len. 6]: `` The name is known .
Parsing [sent. 315 len. 6]: Who is the other ? ''
Parsing [sent. 316 len. 6]: `` A friend of his .
Parsing [sent. 317 len. 5]: I do not know .
Parsing [sent. 318 len. 22]: All the upper floor of the east wing they have taken -- the Grande Suite -- those two and their valet-de-chambre .
Parsing [sent. 319 len. 16]: That is truly the way in modern times -- the philosophers are rich men . ''
Parsing [sent. 320 len. 7]: `` Yes , '' I sighed .
Parsing [sent. 321 len. 9]: `` Only the painters are poor nowadays . ''
Parsing [sent. 322 len. 8]: `` Ha , ha , monsieur ! ''
Parsing [sent. 323 len. 4]: Amedee laughed cunningly .
Parsing [sent. 324 len. 17]: `` It was always easy to see that monsieur only amuses himself with his painting . ''
Parsing [sent. 325 len. 10]: `` Thank you , Amedee , '' I responded .
Parsing [sent. 326 len. 14]: `` I have amused other people with it too , I fear . ''
Parsing [sent. 327 len. 7]: `` Oh , without doubt ! ''
Parsing [sent. 328 len. 10]: he agreed graciously , as he folded the cloth .
Parsing [sent. 329 len. 40]: I have always tried to believe that it was not so much my pictures as the fact that I paid my bills the day they were presented which convinced everybody about Les Trois Pigeons that I was an amateur .
Parsing [sent. 330 len. 27]: But I never became happily enough settled in this opinion to risk pressing an investigation ; and it was a relief that Amedee changed the subject .
Parsing [sent. 331 len. 22]: `` Monsieur remembers the Chateau de Quesnay -- at the crest of the hill on the road north of Dives ? ''
Parsing [sent. 332 len. 5]: `` I remember . ''
Parsing [sent. 333 len. 12]: `` It is occupied this season by some rich Americans . ''
Parsing [sent. 334 len. 10]: `` How do you know they are rich ? ''
Parsing [sent. 335 len. 6]: `` Dieu de Dieu ! ''
Parsing [sent. 336 len. 7]: The old fellow appealed to heaven .
Parsing [sent. 337 len. 7]: `` But they are Americans ! ''
Parsing [sent. 338 len. 5]: `` And therefore millionaires .
Parsing [sent. 339 len. 5]: Perfectly , Amedee . ''
Parsing [sent. 340 len. 5]: `` Perfectly , monsieur .
Parsing [sent. 341 len. 6]: Perhaps monsieur knows them . ''
Parsing [sent. 342 len. 8]: `` Yes , I know them . ''
Parsing [sent. 343 len. 4]: `` Truly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 344 len. 4]: He affected dejection .
Parsing [sent. 345 len. 35]: `` And poor Madame Brossard thought monsieur had returned to our old hotel because he liked it , and remembered our wine of Beaune and the good beds and old Gaston 's cooking ! ''
Parsing [sent. 346 len. 11]: `` Do not weep , Amedee , '' I said .
Parsing [sent. 347 len. 19]: `` I have come to paint ; not because I know the people who have taken Quesnay . ''
Parsing [sent. 348 len. 14]: And I added : `` I may not see them at all . ''
Parsing [sent. 349 len. 8]: In truth I thought that very probable .
Parsing [sent. 350 len. 35]: Miss Elizabeth had mentioned in one of her notes that Ward had leased Quesnay , but I had not sought quarters at Les Trois Pigeons because it stood within walking distance of the chateau .
Parsing [sent. 351 len. 13]: In my industrious frame of mind that circumstance seemed almost a drawback .
Parsing [sent. 352 len. 52]: Miss Elizabeth , ever hospitable to those whom she noticed at all , would be doubly so in the country , as people always are ; and I wanted all my time to myself -- no very selfish wish since my time was not conceivably of value to any one else .
Parsing [sent. 353 len. 38]: I thought it wise to leave any encounter with the lady to chance , and as the by-paths of the country-side were many and intricate , I intended , without ungallantry , to render the chance remote .
Parsing [sent. 354 len. 56]: George himself had just sailed on a business trip to America , as I knew from her last missive ; and until his return , I should put in all my time at painting and nothing else , though I liked his sister , as I have said , and thought of her -- often .
Parsing [sent. 355 len. 12]: Amedee doubted my sincerity , however , for he laughed incredulously .
Parsing [sent. 356 len. 11]: `` Eh , well , monsieur enjoys saying it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 357 len. 3]: `` Certainly .
Parsing [sent. 358 len. 11]: It is a pleasure to say what one means . ''
Parsing [sent. 359 len. 8]: `` But monsieur could not mean it .
Parsing [sent. 360 len. 25]: Monsieur will call at the chateau in the morning '' -- the complacent varlet prophesied -- `` as early as it will be polite .
Parsing [sent. 361 len. 6]: I am sure of that .
Parsing [sent. 362 len. 14]: Monsieur is not at all an old man ; no , not yet !
Parsing [sent. 363 len. 7]: Even if he were , aha !
Parsing [sent. 364 len. 19]: no one could possess the friendship of that wonderful Madame d'Armand and remain away from the chateau . ''
Parsing [sent. 365 len. 5]: `` Madame d'Armand ? ''
Parsing [sent. 366 len. 3]: I said .
Parsing [sent. 367 len. 7]: `` That is not the name .
Parsing [sent. 368 len. 6]: You mean Mademoiselle Ward . ''
Parsing [sent. 369 len. 6]: `` No , no ! ''
Parsing [sent. 370 len. 23]: He shook his head and his fat cheeks bulged with a smile which I believe he intended to express a respectful roguishness .
Parsing [sent. 371 len. 28]: `` Mademoiselle Ward '' -LRB- he pronounced it `` Ware '' -RRB- `` is magnificent ; every one must fly to obey when she opens her mouth .
Parsing [sent. 372 len. 19]: If she did not like the ocean there below the chateau , the ocean would have to move !
Parsing [sent. 373 len. 19]: It needs only a glance to perceive that Mademoiselle Ward is a great lady -- but MADAME D'ARMAND !
Parsing [sent. 374 len. 3]: AHA ! ''
Parsing [sent. 375 len. 37]: He rolled his round eyes to an effect of unspeakable admiration , and with a gesture indicated that he would have kissed his hand to the stars , had that been properly reverential to Madame d'Armand .
Parsing [sent. 376 len. 10]: `` But monsieur knows very well for himself ! ''
Parsing [sent. 377 len. 15]: `` Monsieur knows that you are very confusing -- even for a maitre d'hotel .
Parsing [sent. 378 len. 13]: We were speaking of the present chatelaine of Quesnay , Mademoiselle Ward .
Parsing [sent. 379 len. 9]: I have never heard of Madame d'Armand . ''
Parsing [sent. 380 len. 6]: `` Monsieur is serious ? ''
Parsing [sent. 381 len. 4]: `` Truly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 382 len. 10]: I answered , making bold to quote his shibboleth .
Parsing [sent. 383 len. 10]: `` Then monsieur has truly much to live for .
Parsing [sent. 384 len. 3]: Truly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 385 len. 33]: he chuckled openly , convinced that he had obtained a marked advantage in a conflict of wits , shaking his big head from side to side with an exasperating air of knowingness .
Parsing [sent. 386 len. 5]: `` Ah , truly !
Parsing [sent. 387 len. 18]: When that lady drives by , some day , in the carriage from the chateau -- eh ?
Parsing [sent. 388 len. 12]: Then monsieur will see how much he has to live for .
Parsing [sent. 389 len. 7]: Truly , truly , truly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 390 len. 35]: He had cleared the table , and now , with a final explosion of the word which gave him such immoderate satisfaction , he lifted the tray and made one of his precipitate departures .
Parsing [sent. 391 len. 16]: `` Amedee , '' I said , as he slackened down to his sidelong leisure .
Parsing [sent. 392 len. 4]: `` Monsieur ? ''
Parsing [sent. 393 len. 7]: `` Who is Madame d'Armand ? ''
Parsing [sent. 394 len. 9]: `` A guest of Mademoiselle Ward at Quesnay .
Parsing [sent. 395 len. 23]: In fact , she is in charge of the chateau , since Mademoiselle Ward is , for the time , away . ''
Parsing [sent. 396 len. 7]: `` Is she a Frenchwoman ? ''
Parsing [sent. 397 len. 5]: `` It seems not .
Parsing [sent. 398 len. 17]: In fact , she is an American , though she dresses with so much of taste .
Parsing [sent. 399 len. 38]: Ah , Madame Brossard admits it , and Madame Brossard knows the art of dressing , for she spends a week of every winter in Rouen -- and besides there is Trouville itself only some kilometres distant .
Parsing [sent. 400 len. 20]: Madame Brossard says that Mademoiselle Ward dresses with richness and splendour and Madame d'Armand with economy , but beauty .
Parsing [sent. 401 len. 9]: Those were the words used by Madame Brossard .
Parsing [sent. 402 len. 3]: Truly . ''
Parsing [sent. 403 len. 12]: `` Madame d'Armand 's name is French , '' I observed .
Parsing [sent. 404 len. 12]: `` Yes , that is true , '' said Amedee thoughtfully .
Parsing [sent. 405 len. 14]: `` No one can deny it ; it is a French name . ''
Parsing [sent. 406 len. 14]: He rested the tray upon a stump near by and scratched his head .
Parsing [sent. 407 len. 15]: `` I do not understand how that can be , '' he continued slowly .
Parsing [sent. 408 len. 18]: `` Jean Ferret , who is chief gardener at the chateau , is an acquaintance of mine .
Parsing [sent. 409 len. 32]: We sometimes have a cup of cider at Pere Baudry 's , a kilometre down the road from here ; and Jean Ferret has told me that she is an American .
Parsing [sent. 410 len. 14]: And yet , as you say , monsieur , the name is French .
Parsing [sent. 411 len. 8]: Perhaps she is French after all . ''
Parsing [sent. 412 len. 40]: `` I believe , '' said I , `` that if I struggled a few days over this puzzle , I might come to the conclusion that Madame d'Armand is an American lady who has married a Frenchman . ''
Parsing [sent. 413 len. 9]: The old man uttered an exclamation of triumph .
Parsing [sent. 414 len. 3]: `` Ha !
Parsing [sent. 415 len. 3]: without doubt !
Parsing [sent. 416 len. 13]: Truly she must be an American lady who has married a Frenchman .
Parsing [sent. 417 len. 7]: Monsieur has already solved the puzzle .
Parsing [sent. 418 len. 5]: Truly , truly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 419 len. 29]: And he trulied himself across the darkness , to emerge in the light of the open door of the kitchen with the word still rumbling in his throat .
Parsing [sent. 420 len. 45]: Now for a time there came the clinking of dishes , sounds as of pans and kettles being scoured , the rolling gutturals of old Gaston , the cook , and the treble pipings of young `` Glouglou , '' his grandchild and scullion .
Parsing [sent. 421 len. 45]: After a while the oblong of light from the kitchen door disappeared ; the voices departed ; the stillness of the dark descended , and with it that unreasonable sense of pathos which night in the country brings to the heart of a wanderer .
Parsing [sent. 422 len. 52]: Then , out of the lonely silence , there issued a strange , incongruous sound as an execrable voice essayed to produce the semblance of an air odiously familiar about the streets of Paris some three years past , and I became aware of a smell of some dreadful thing burning .
Parsing [sent. 423 len. 27]: Beneath the arbour I perceived a glowing spark which seemed to bear a certain relation to an oval whitish patch suggesting the front of a shirt .
Parsing [sent. 424 len. 22]: It was Amedee , at ease , smoking his cigarette after the day 's work and convinced that he was singing .
Parsing [sent. 425 len. 16]: `` Pour qu ` j' finisse Mon service Au Tonkin je suis parti -- Ah !
Parsing [sent. 426 len. 6]: quel beau pays , mesdames !
Parsing [sent. 427 len. 9]: C'est l'paradis des p ` tites femmes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 428 len. 27]: I rose from the chair on my little porch , to go to bed ; but I was reminded of something , and called to him .
Parsing [sent. 429 len. 4]: `` Monsieur ? ''
Parsing [sent. 430 len. 5]: his voice came briskly .
Parsing [sent. 431 len. 18]: `` How often do you see your friend , Jean Ferret , the gardener of Quesnay ? ''
Parsing [sent. 432 len. 5]: `` Frequently , monsieur .
Parsing [sent. 433 len. 21]: To-morrow morning I could easily carry a message if -- '' `` That is precisely what I do not wish .
Parsing [sent. 434 len. 16]: And you may as well not mention me at all when you meet him . ''
Parsing [sent. 435 len. 5]: `` It is understood .
Parsing [sent. 436 len. 3]: Perfectly . ''
Parsing [sent. 437 len. 22]: `` If it is well understood , there will be a beautiful present for a good maitre d'hotel some day . ''
Parsing [sent. 438 len. 7]: `` Thank you , monsieur . ''
Parsing [sent. 439 len. 7]: `` Good night , Amedee . ''
Parsing [sent. 440 len. 7]: `` Good night , monsieur . ''
Parsing [sent. 441 len. 24]: Falling to sleep has always been an intricate matter with me : I liken it to a nightly adventure in an enchanted palace .
Parsing [sent. 442 len. 65]: Weary-limbed and with burning eyelids , after long waiting in the outer court of wakefulness , I enter a dim , cool antechamber where the heavy garment of the body is left behind and where , perhaps , some acquaintance or friend greets me with a familiar speech or a bit of nonsense -- or an unseen orchestra may play music that I know .
Parsing [sent. 443 len. 60]: From here I go into a spacious apartment where the air and light are of a fine clarity , for it is the hall of revelations , and in it the secrets of secrets are told , mysteries are resolved , perplexities cleared up , and sometimes I learn what to do about a picture that has bothered me .
Parsing [sent. 444 len. 57]: This is where I would linger , for beyond it I walk among crowding fantasies , delusions , terrors and shame , to a curtain of darkness where they take my memory from me , and I know nothing of my own adventures until I am pushed out of a secret door into the morning sunlight .
Parsing [sent. 445 len. 12]: Amedee was the acquaintance who met me in the antechamber to-night .
Parsing [sent. 446 len. 17]: He remarked that Madame d'Armand was the most beautiful woman in the world , and vanished .
Parsing [sent. 447 len. 21]: And in the hall of revelations I thought that I found a statue of her -- but it was veiled .
Parsing [sent. 448 len. 39]: I wished to remove the veil , but a passing stranger stopped and told me laughingly that the veil was all that would ever be revealed of her to me -- of her , or any other woman !
Parsing [sent. 449 len. 52]: CHAPTER IV I was up with the birds in the morning ; had my breakfast with them -- a very drowsy-eyed Amedee assisting -- and made off for the forest to get the sunrise through the branches , a pack on my back and three sandwiches for lunch in my pocket .
Parsing [sent. 450 len. 31]: I returned only with the failing light of evening , cheerfully tired and ready for a fine dinner and an early bed , both of which the good inn supplied .
Parsing [sent. 451 len. 38]: It was my daily programme ; a healthy life `` far from the world , '' as Amedee said , and I was sorry when the serpent entered and disturbed it , though he was my own .
Parsing [sent. 452 len. 15]: He is a pet of mine ; has been with me since my childhood .
Parsing [sent. 453 len. 22]: He leaves me when I live alone , for he loves company , but returns whenever my kind are about me .
Parsing [sent. 454 len. 26]: There are many names for snakes of his breed , but , to deal charitably with myself , I call mine Interest-In-Other-People 's - Affairs .
Parsing [sent. 455 len. 92]: One evening I returned to find a big van from Dives , the nearest railway station , drawn up in the courtyard at the foot of the stairs leading to the gallery , and all of the people of the inn , from Madame Brossard -LRB- who directed -RRB- to Glouglou -LRB- who madly attempted the heaviest pieces -RRB- , busily installing trunks , bags , and packing-cases in the suite engaged for the `` great man of science '' on the second floor of the east wing of the building .
Parsing [sent. 456 len. 49]: Neither the great man nor his companion was to be seen , however , both having retired to their rooms immediately upon their arrival -- so Amedee informed me , as he wiped his brow after staggering up the steps under a load of books wrapped in sacking .
Parsing [sent. 457 len. 70]: I made my evening ablutions removing a Joseph 's coat of dust and paint ; and came forth from my pavilion , hoping that Professor Keredec and his friend would not mind eating in the same garden with a man in a corduroy jacket and knickerbockers ; but the gentlemen continued invisible to the public eye , and mine was the only table set for dinner in the garden .
Parsing [sent. 458 len. 29]: Up-stairs the curtains were carefully drawn across all the windows of the east wing ; little leaks of orange , here and there , betraying the lights within .
Parsing [sent. 459 len. 29]: Glouglou , bearing a tray of covered dishes , was just entering the salon of the `` Grande Suite , '' and the door closed quickly after him .
Parsing [sent. 460 len. 21]: `` It is to be supposed that Professor Keredec and his friend are fatigued with their journey from Paris ? ''
Parsing [sent. 461 len. 7]: I began , a little later .
Parsing [sent. 462 len. 13]: `` Monsieur , they did not seem fatigued , '' said Amedee .
Parsing [sent. 463 len. 11]: `` But they dine in their own rooms to-night . ''
Parsing [sent. 464 len. 6]: `` Every night , monsieur .
Parsing [sent. 465 len. 8]: It is the order of Professor Keredec .
Parsing [sent. 466 len. 9]: And with their own valet-de-chambre to serve them .
Parsing [sent. 467 len. 3]: Eh ? ''
Parsing [sent. 468 len. 6]: He poured my coffee solemnly .
Parsing [sent. 469 len. 15]: `` That is mysterious , to say the least , is n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 470 len. 11]: `` To say the very least , '' I agreed .
Parsing [sent. 471 len. 17]: `` Monsieur the professor is a man of secrets , it appears , '' continued Amedee .
Parsing [sent. 472 len. 43]: `` When he wrote to Madame Brossard engaging his rooms , he instructed her to be careful that none of us should mention even his name ; and to-day when he came , he spoke of his anxiety on that point . ''
Parsing [sent. 473 len. 8]: `` But you did mention it . ''
Parsing [sent. 474 len. 7]: `` To whom , monsieur ? ''
Parsing [sent. 475 len. 6]: asked the old fellow blankly .
Parsing [sent. 476 len. 5]: `` To me . ''
Parsing [sent. 477 len. 14]: `` But I told him I had not , '' said Amedee placidly .
Parsing [sent. 478 len. 8]: `` It is the same thing . ''
Parsing [sent. 479 len. 28]: `` I wonder , '' I began , struck by a sudden thought , `` if it will prove quite the same thing in my own case .
Parsing [sent. 480 len. 22]: I suppose you have not mentioned the circumstance of my being here to your friend , Jean Ferret of Quesnay ? ''
Parsing [sent. 481 len. 6]: He looked at me reproachfully .
Parsing [sent. 482 len. 14]: `` Has monsieur been troubled by the people of the chateau ? '' ''
Parsing [sent. 483 len. 7]: ` Troubled ' by them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 484 len. 12]: `` Have they come to seek out monsieur and disturb him ?
Parsing [sent. 485 len. 16]: Have they done anything whatever to show that they have heard monsieur is here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 486 len. 17]: `` No , certainly they have n't , '' I was obliged to retract at once .
Parsing [sent. 487 len. 9]: `` I beg your pardon , Amedee . ''
Parsing [sent. 488 len. 6]: `` Ah , monsieur ! ''
Parsing [sent. 489 len. 31]: He made a deprecatory bow -LRB- which plunged me still deeper in shame -RRB- , struck a match , and offered a light for my cigar with a forgiving hand .
Parsing [sent. 490 len. 20]: `` All the same , '' he pursued , `` it seems very mysterious -- this Keredec affair ! ''
Parsing [sent. 491 len. 24]: `` To comprehend a great man , Amedee , '' I said , `` is the next thing to sharing his greatness . ''
Parsing [sent. 492 len. 23]: He blinked slightly , pondered a moment upon this sententious drivel , then very properly ignored it , reverting to his puzzle .
Parsing [sent. 493 len. 16]: `` But is it not incomprehensible that people should eat indoors this fine weather ? ''
Parsing [sent. 494 len. 6]: I admitted that it was .
Parsing [sent. 495 len. 42]: I knew very well how hot and stuffy the salon of Madame Brossard 's `` Grande Suite '' must be , while the garden was fragrant in the warm , dry night , and the outdoor air like a gentle tonic .
Parsing [sent. 496 len. 11]: Nevertheless , Professor Keredec and his friend preferred the salon .
Parsing [sent. 497 len. 24]: When a man is leading a very quiet and isolated life , it is inconceivable what trifles will occupy and concentrate his attention .
Parsing [sent. 498 len. 45]: The smaller the community the more blowzy with gossip you are sure to find it ; and I have little doubt that when Friday learned enough English , one of the first things Crusoe did was to tell him some scandal about the goat .
Parsing [sent. 499 len. 79]: Thus , though I treated the `` Keredec affair '' with a seeming airiness to Amedee , I cunningly drew the faithful rascal out , and fed my curiosity upon his own -LRB- which , as time went on and the mystery deepened , seemed likely to burst him -RRB- , until , virtually , I was receiving , every evening at dinner , a detailed report of the day 's doings of Professor Keredec and his companion .
Parsing [sent. 500 len. 9]: The reports were voluminous , the details few .
Parsing [sent. 501 len. 20]: The two gentlemen , as Amedee would relate , spent their forenoons over books and writing in their rooms .
Parsing [sent. 502 len. 41]: Professor Keredec 's voice could often be heard in every part of the inn ; at times holding forth with such protracted vehemence that only one explanation would suffice : the learned man was delivering a lecture to his companion .
Parsing [sent. 503 len. 5]: `` Say then ! ''
Parsing [sent. 504 len. 11]: exclaimed Amedee -- `` what king of madness is that ?
Parsing [sent. 505 len. 9]: To make orations for only one auditor ! ''
Parsing [sent. 506 len. 24]: He brushed away my suggestion that the auditor might be a stenographer to whom the professor was dictating chapters for a new book .
Parsing [sent. 507 len. 19]: The relation between the two men , he contended , was more like that between teacher and pupil .
Parsing [sent. 508 len. 9]: `` But a pupil with gray hair ! ''
Parsing [sent. 509 len. 10]: he finished , raising his fat hands to heaven .
Parsing [sent. 510 len. 13]: `` For that other monsieur has hair as gray as mine . ''
Parsing [sent. 511 len. 43]: `` That other monsieur '' was farther described as a thin man , handsome , but with a `` singular air , '' nor could my colleague more satisfactorily define this air , though he made a racking struggle to do so .
Parsing [sent. 512 len. 12]: `` In what does the peculiarity of his manner lie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 513 len. 3]: I asked .
Parsing [sent. 514 len. 25]: `` But it is not so much that his manner is peculiar , monsieur ; it is an air about him that is singular .
Parsing [sent. 515 len. 3]: Truly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 516 len. 8]: `` But how is it singular ? ''
Parsing [sent. 517 len. 11]: `` Monsieur , it is very , very singular . ''
Parsing [sent. 518 len. 10]: `` You do not understand , '' I insisted .
Parsing [sent. 519 len. 16]: `` What kind of singularity has the air of ` that other monsieur ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 520 len. 20]: `` It has , '' replied Amedee , with a powerful effort , `` a very singular singularity . ''
Parsing [sent. 521 len. 24]: This was as near as he could come , and , fearful of injuring him , I abandoned that phase of our subject .
Parsing [sent. 522 len. 25]: The valet-de-chambre whom my fellow-lodgers had brought with them from Paris contributed nothing to the inn 's knowledge of his masters , I learned .
Parsing [sent. 523 len. 26]: This struck me not only as odd , but unique , for French servants tell one another everything , and more -- very much more .
Parsing [sent. 524 len. 13]: `` But this is a silent man , '' said Amedee impressively .
Parsing [sent. 525 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 526 len. 3]: very silent !
Parsing [sent. 527 len. 14]: He shakes his head wisely , yet he will not open his mouth .
Parsing [sent. 528 len. 26]: However , that may be because '' -- and now the explanation came -- `` because he was engaged only last week and knows nothing .
Parsing [sent. 529 len. 20]: Also , he is but temporary ; he returns to Paris soon and Glouglou is to serve them . ''
Parsing [sent. 530 len. 47]: I ascertained that although `` that other monsieur '' had gray hair , he was by no means a person of great age ; indeed , Glouglou , who had seen him oftener than any other of the staff , maintained that he was quite young .
Parsing [sent. 531 len. 10]: Amedee 's own opportunities for observation had been limited .
Parsing [sent. 532 len. 56]: Every afternoon the two gentlemen went for a walk ; but they always came down from the gallery so quickly , he declared , and , leaving the inn by a rear entrance , plunged so hastily into the nearest by-path leading to the forest , that he caught little more than glimpses of them .
Parsing [sent. 533 len. 41]: They returned after an hour or so , entering the inn with the same appearance of haste to be out of sight , the professor always talking , `` with the manner of an orator , but in English . ''
Parsing [sent. 534 len. 21]: Nevertheless , Amedee remarked , it was certain that Professor Keredec 's friend was neither an American nor an Englishman .
Parsing [sent. 535 len. 7]: `` Why is it certain ? ''
Parsing [sent. 536 len. 3]: I asked .
Parsing [sent. 537 len. 24]: `` Monsieur , he drinks nothing but water , he does not smoke , and Glouglou says he speaks very pure French . ''
Parsing [sent. 538 len. 10]: `` Glouglou is an authority who resolves the difficulty .
Parsing [sent. 539 len. 10]: ` That other monsieur ' is a Frenchman . ''
Parsing [sent. 540 len. 10]: `` But , monsieur , he is smooth-shaven . ''
Parsing [sent. 541 len. 10]: `` Perhaps he has been a maitre d'hotel . ''
Parsing [sent. 542 len. 3]: `` Eh !
Parsing [sent. 543 len. 18]: I wish one that _ I _ know could hope to dress as well when he retires !
Parsing [sent. 544 len. 13]: Besides , Glouglou says that other monsieur eats his soup silently . ''
Parsing [sent. 545 len. 20]: `` I can find no flaw in the deduction , '' I said , rising to go to bed .
Parsing [sent. 546 len. 10]: `` We must leave it there for to-night . ''
Parsing [sent. 547 len. 76]: The next evening Amedee allowed me to perceive that he was concealing something under his arm as he stoked the coffee-machine , and upon my asking what it was , he glanced round the courtyard with histrionic slyness , placed the object on the table beside my cap , and stepped back to watch the impression , his manner that of one who declaims : `` At last the missing papers are before you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 548 len. 6]: `` What is that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 549 len. 3]: I said .
Parsing [sent. 550 len. 7]: `` It is a book . ''
Parsing [sent. 551 len. 38]: `` I am persuaded by your candour , Amedee , as well as by the general appearance of this article , '' I returned as I picked it up , `` that you are speaking the truth .
Parsing [sent. 552 len. 10]: But why do you bring it to me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 553 len. 34]: `` Monsieur , '' he replied , in the tones of an old conspirator , `` this afternoon the professor and that other monsieur went as usual to walk in the forest . ''
Parsing [sent. 554 len. 24]: He bent over me , pretending to be busy with the coffee - machine , and lowering his voice to a hoarse whisper .
Parsing [sent. 555 len. 29]: `` When they returned , this book fell from the pocket of that other monsieur 's coat as he ascended the stair , and he did not notice .
Parsing [sent. 556 len. 22]: Later I shall return it by Glouglou , but I thought it wise that monsieur should see it for himself . ''
Parsing [sent. 557 len. 10]: The book was Wentworth 's Algebra -- elementary principles .
Parsing [sent. 558 len. 23]: Painful recollections of my boyhood and the binomial theorem rose in my mind as I let the leaves turn under my fingers .
Parsing [sent. 559 len. 9]: `` What do you make of it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 560 len. 3]: I asked .
Parsing [sent. 561 len. 7]: His tone became even more confidential .
Parsing [sent. 562 len. 15]: `` Part of it , monsieur , is in English ; that is plain .
Parsing [sent. 563 len. 28]: I have found an English word in it that I know -- the word ` O. ' But much of the printing is also in Arabic . ''
Parsing [sent. 564 len. 4]: `` Arabic ! ''
Parsing [sent. 565 len. 3]: I exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 566 len. 9]: `` Yes , monsieur , look there . ''
Parsing [sent. 567 len. 21]: He laid a fat forefinger on '' -LRB- a + b -RRB- 2 = a2 + 2ab + b2 . ''
Parsing [sent. 568 len. 5]: `` That is Arabic .
Parsing [sent. 569 len. 21]: Old Gaston has been to Algeria , and he says that he knows Arabic as well as he does French .
Parsing [sent. 570 len. 12]: He looked at the book and told me it was Arabic .
Parsing [sent. 571 len. 2]: Truly !
Parsing [sent. 572 len. 3]: Truly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 573 len. 11]: `` Did he translate any of it for you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 574 len. 12]: `` No , monsieur ; his eyes pained him this afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 575 len. 9]: He says he will read it to-morrow . ''
Parsing [sent. 576 len. 10]: `` But you must return the book to-night . ''
Parsing [sent. 577 len. 5]: `` That is true .
Parsing [sent. 578 len. 2]: Eh !
Parsing [sent. 579 len. 25]: It leaves the mystery deeper than ever , unless monsieur can find some clue in those parts of the book that are English . ''
Parsing [sent. 580 len. 7]: I shed no light upon him .
Parsing [sent. 581 len. 29]: The book had been Greek to me in my tender years ; it was a pleasure now to leave a fellow-being under the impression that it was Arabic .
Parsing [sent. 582 len. 25]: But the volume took its little revenge upon me , for it increased my curiosity about Professor Keredec and `` that other monsieur . ''
Parsing [sent. 583 len. 38]: Why were two grown men -- one an eminent psychologist and the other a gray-haired youth with a singular air -- carrying about on their walks a text-book for the instruction of boys of thirteen or fourteen ?
Parsing [sent. 584 len. 12]: The next day that curiosity of mine was piqued in earnest .
Parsing [sent. 585 len. 34]: It rained and I did not leave the inn , but sat under the great archway and took notes in colour of the shining road , bright drenched fields , and dripping sky .
Parsing [sent. 586 len. 42]: My back was toward the courtyard , that is , `` three-quarters '' to it , and about noon I became distracted from my work by a strong self - consciousness which came upon me without any visible or audible cause .
Parsing [sent. 587 len. 28]: Obeying an impulse , I swung round on my camp-stool and looked up directly at the gallery window of the salon of the `` Grande Suite . ''
Parsing [sent. 588 len. 23]: A man with a great white beard was standing at the window , half hidden by the curtain , watching me intently .
Parsing [sent. 589 len. 26]: He perceived that I saw him and dropped the curtain immediately , a speck of colour in his buttonhole catching my eye as it fell .
Parsing [sent. 590 len. 6]: The spy was Professor Keredec .
Parsing [sent. 591 len. 13]: But why should he study me so slyly and yet so obviously ?
Parsing [sent. 592 len. 9]: I had no intention of intruding upon him .
Parsing [sent. 593 len. 22]: Nor was I a psychological `` specimen , '' though I began to suspect that `` that other monsieur '' WAS .
Parsing [sent. 594 len. 30]: CHAPTER V I had been painting in various parts of the forest , studying the early morning along the eastern fringe and moving deeper in as the day advanced .
Parsing [sent. 595 len. 65]: For the stillness and warmth of noon I went to the very woodland heart , and in the late afternoon moved westward to a glade -- a chance arena open to the sky , the scene of my most audacious endeavours , for here I was trying to paint foliage luminous under those long shafts of sunshine which grow thinner but ruddier toward sunset .
Parsing [sent. 596 len. 51]: A path closely bordered by underbrush wound its way to the glade , crossed it , then wandered away into shady dingles again ; and with my easel pitched in the mouth of this path , I sat at work , one late afternoon , wonderful for its still loveliness .
Parsing [sent. 597 len. 66]: The path debouched abruptly on the glade and was so narrow that when I leaned back my elbows were in the bushes , and it needed care to keep my palette from being smirched by the leaves ; though there was more room for my canvas and easel , as I had placed them at arm 's length before me , fairly in the open .
Parsing [sent. 598 len. 89]: I had the ambition to paint a picture here -- to do the whole thing in the woods from day to day , instead of taking notes for the studio -- and was at work upon a very foolish experiment : I had thought to render the light -- broken by the branches and foliage -- with broken brush-work , a short stroke of the kind that stung an elder painter to swear that its practitioners painted in shaking fear of the concierge appearing for the studio rent .
Parsing [sent. 599 len. 37]: The attempt was alluring , but when I rose from my camp-stool and stepped back into the path to get more distance for my canvas , I saw what a mess I was making of it .
Parsing [sent. 600 len. 57]: At the same time , my hand , falling into the capacious pocket of my jacket , encountered a package , my lunch , which I had forgotten to eat , whereupon , becoming suddenly aware that I was very hungry , I began to eat Amedee 's good sandwiches without moving from where I stood .
Parsing [sent. 601 len. 42]: Absorbed , gazing with abysmal disgust at my canvas , I was eating absent - mindedly -- and with all the restraint and dignity of a Georgia darky attacking a watermelon -- when a pleasant voice spoke from just behind me .
Parsing [sent. 602 len. 15]: `` Pardon , monsieur ; permit me to pass , if you please . ''
Parsing [sent. 603 len. 21]: That was all it said , very quietly and in French , but a gunshot might have startled me less .
Parsing [sent. 604 len. 29]: I turned in confusion to behold a dark-eyed lady , charmingly dressed in lilac and white , waiting for me to make way so that she could pass .
Parsing [sent. 605 len. 40]: Nay , let me leave no detail of my mortification unrecorded : I have just said that I `` turned in confusion '' ; the truth is that I jumped like a kangaroo , but with infinitely less grace .
Parsing [sent. 606 len. 59]: And in my nervous haste to clear her way , meaning only to push the camp-stool out of the path with my foot , I put too much valour into the push , and with horror saw the camp-stool rise in the air and drop to the ground again nearly a third of the distance across the glade .
Parsing [sent. 607 len. 18]: Upon that I squeezed myself back into the bushes , my ears singing and my cheeks burning .
Parsing [sent. 608 len. 60]: There are women who will meet or pass a strange man in the woods or fields with as finished an air of being unaware of him -LRB- particularly if he be a rather shabby painter no longer young -RRB- as if the encounter took place on a city sidewalk ; but this woman was not of that priggish kind .
Parsing [sent. 609 len. 72]: Her straightforward glance recognised my existence as a fellow-being ; and she further acknowledged it by a faint smile , which was of courtesy only , however , and admitted no reference to the fact that at the first sound of her voice I had leaped into the air , kicked a camp-stool twenty feet , and now stood blushing , so shamefully stuffed with sandwich that I dared not speak .
Parsing [sent. 610 len. 29]: `` Thank you , '' she said as she went by ; and made me a little bow so graceful that it almost consoled me for my caperings .
Parsing [sent. 611 len. 23]: I stood looking after her as she crossed the clearing and entered the cool winding of the path on the other side .
Parsing [sent. 612 len. 37]: I stared and wished -- wished that I could have painted her into my picture , with the thin , ruddy sunshine flecking her dress ; wished that I had not cut such an idiotic figure .
Parsing [sent. 613 len. 21]: I stared until her filmy summer hat , which was the last bit of her to disappear , had vanished .
Parsing [sent. 614 len. 39]: Then , discovering that I still held the horrid remains of a sausage-sandwich in my hand , I threw it into the underbrush with unnecessary force , and , recovering my camp-stool , sat down to work again .
Parsing [sent. 615 len. 6]: I did not immediately begin .
Parsing [sent. 616 len. 40]: The passing of a pretty woman anywhere never comes to be quite of no moment to a man , and the passing of a pretty woman in the greenwood is an episode -- even to a middle-aged landscape painter .
Parsing [sent. 617 len. 5]: `` An episode ? ''
Parsing [sent. 618 len. 63]: quoth I. I should be ashamed to withhold the truth out of my fear to be taken for a sentimentalist : this woman who had passed was of great and instant charm ; it was as if I had heard a serenade there in the woods -- and at thought of the jig I had danced to it my face burned again .
Parsing [sent. 619 len. 70]: With a sigh of no meaning , I got my eyes down to my canvas and began to peck at it perfunctorily , when a snapping of twigs underfoot and a swishing of branches in the thicket warned me of a second intruder , not approaching by the path , but forcing a way toward it through the underbrush , and very briskly too , judging by the sounds .
Parsing [sent. 620 len. 29]: He burst out into the glade a few paces from me , a tall man in white flannels , liberally decorated with brambles and clinging shreds of underbrush .
Parsing [sent. 621 len. 48]: A streamer of vine had caught about his shoulders ; there were leaves on his bare head , and this , together with the youthful sprightliness of his light figure and the naive activity of his approach , gave me a very faunlike first impression of him .
Parsing [sent. 622 len. 8]: At sight of me he stopped short .
Parsing [sent. 623 len. 20]: `` Have you seen a lady in a white and lilac dress and with roses in her hat ? ''
Parsing [sent. 624 len. 25]: he demanded , omitting all preface and speaking with a quick eagerness which caused me no wonder -- for I had seen the lady .
Parsing [sent. 625 len. 39]: What did surprise me , however , was the instantaneous certainty with which I recognised the speaker from Amedee 's description ; certainty founded on the very item which had so dangerously strained the old fellow 's powers .
Parsing [sent. 626 len. 74]: My sudden gentleman was strikingly good-looking , his complexion so clear and boyishly healthy , that , except for his gray hair , he might have passed for twenty-two or twenty-three , and even as it was I guessed his years short of thirty ; but there are plenty of handsome young fellows with prematurely gray hair , and , as Amedee said , though out of the world we were near it .
Parsing [sent. 627 len. 14]: It was the new-comer 's `` singular air '' which established his identity .
Parsing [sent. 628 len. 24]: Amedee 's vagueness had irked me , but the thing itself -- the `` singular air '' -- was not at all vague .
Parsing [sent. 629 len. 15]: Instantly perceptible , it was an investiture ; marked , definite -- and intangible .
Parsing [sent. 630 len. 9]: My interrogator was `` that other monsieur . ''
Parsing [sent. 631 len. 19]: In response to his question I asked him another : `` Were the roses real or artificial ? ''
Parsing [sent. 632 len. 22]: `` I do n't know , '' he answered , with what I took to be a whimsical assumption of gravity .
Parsing [sent. 633 len. 9]: `` It would n't matter , would it ?
Parsing [sent. 634 len. 6]: Have you seen her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 635 len. 32]: He stooped to brush the brambles from his trousers , sending me a sidelong glance from his blue eyes , which were brightly confident and inquiring , like a boy 's .
Parsing [sent. 636 len. 53]: At the same time it struck me that whatever the nature of the singularity investing him it partook of nothing repellent , but , on the contrary , measurably enhanced his attractiveness ; making him `` different '' and lending him a distinction which , without it , he might have lacked .
Parsing [sent. 637 len. 39]: And yet , patent as this singularity must have been to the dullest , it was something quite apart from any eccentricity of manner , though , heaven knows , I was soon to think him odd enough .
Parsing [sent. 638 len. 25]: `` Is n't your description , '' I said gravely , thinking to suit my humour to his own , `` somewhat too general ?
Parsing [sent. 639 len. 8]: Over yonder a few miles lies Houlgate .
Parsing [sent. 640 len. 13]: Trouville itself is not so far , and this is the season .
Parsing [sent. 641 len. 17]: A great many white hats trimmed with roses might come for a stroll in these woods .
Parsing [sent. 642 len. 20]: If you would complete the items -- '' and I waved my hand as if inviting him to continue .
Parsing [sent. 643 len. 21]: `` I have seen her only once before , '' he responded promptly , with a seriousness apparently quite genuine .
Parsing [sent. 644 len. 14]: `` That was from my window at an inn , three days ago .
Parsing [sent. 645 len. 21]: She drove by in an open carriage without looking up , but I could see that she was very handsome .
Parsing [sent. 646 len. 22]: No -- '' he broke off abruptly , but as quickly resumed -- `` handsome is n't just what I mean .
Parsing [sent. 647 len. 6]: Lovely , I should say .
Parsing [sent. 648 len. 19]: That is more like her and a better thing to be , should n't you think so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 649 len. 17]: `` Probably -- yes -- I think so , '' I stammered , in considerable amazement .
Parsing [sent. 650 len. 61]: `` She went by quickly , '' he said , as if he were talking in the most natural and ordinary way in the world , `` but I noticed that while she was in the shade of the inn her hair appeared to be dark , though when the carriage got into the sunlight again it looked fair . ''
Parsing [sent. 651 len. 72]: I had noticed the same thing when the lady who had passed emerged from the shadows of the path into the sunshine of the glade , but I did not speak of it now ; partly because he gave me no opportunity , partly because I was almost too astonished to speak at all , for I was no longer under the delusion that he had any humourous or whimsical intention .
Parsing [sent. 652 len. 49]: `` A little while ago , '' he went on , `` I was up in the branches of a tree over yonder , and I caught a glimpse of a lady in a light dress and a white hat and I thought it might be the same .
Parsing [sent. 653 len. 19]: She wore a dress like that and a white hat with roses when she drove by the inn .
Parsing [sent. 654 len. 10]: I am very anxious to see her again . ''
Parsing [sent. 655 len. 7]: `` You seem to be ! ''
Parsing [sent. 656 len. 8]: `` And have n't you seen her ?
Parsing [sent. 657 len. 8]: Has n't she passed this way ? ''
Parsing [sent. 658 len. 45]: He urged the question with the same strange eagerness which had marked his manner from the first , a manner which confounded me by its absurd resemblance to that of a boy who had not mixed with other boys and had never been teased .
Parsing [sent. 659 len. 23]: And yet his expression was intelligent and alert ; nor was there anything abnormal or `` queer '' in his good-humoured gaze .
Parsing [sent. 660 len. 47]: `` I think that I may have seen her , '' I began slowly ; `` but if you do not know her I should not advise -- '' I was interrupted by a shout and the sound of a large body plunging in the thicket .
Parsing [sent. 661 len. 20]: At this the face of `` that other monsieur '' flushed slightly ; he smiled , but seemed troubled .
Parsing [sent. 662 len. 12]: `` That is a friend of mine , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 663 len. 15]: `` I am afraid he will want me to go back with him . ''
Parsing [sent. 664 len. 7]: And he raised an answering shout .
Parsing [sent. 665 len. 28]: Professor Keredec floundered out through the last row of saplings and bushes , his beard embellished with a broken twig , his big face red and perspiring .
Parsing [sent. 666 len. 40]: He was a fine , a mighty man , ponderous of shoulder , monumental of height , stupendous of girth ; there was cloth enough in the hot-looking black frock-coat he wore for the canopy of a small pavilion .
Parsing [sent. 667 len. 35]: Half a dozen books were under his arm , and in his hand he carried a hat which evidently belonged to `` that other monsieur , '' for his own was on his head .
Parsing [sent. 668 len. 26]: One glance of scrutiny and recognition he shot at me from his silver - rimmed spectacles ; and seized the young man by the arm .
Parsing [sent. 669 len. 7]: `` Ha , my friend ! ''
Parsing [sent. 670 len. 40]: he exclaimed in a bass voice of astounding power and depth , `` that is one way to study botany : to jump out of the middle of a high tree and to run like a crazy man ! ''
Parsing [sent. 671 len. 23]: He spoke with a strong accent and a thunderous rolling of the `` r. '' `` What was I to think ? ''
Parsing [sent. 672 len. 3]: he demanded .
Parsing [sent. 673 len. 8]: `` What has arrived to you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 674 len. 16]: `` I saw a lady I wished to follow , '' the other answered promptly .
Parsing [sent. 675 len. 4]: `` A lady !
Parsing [sent. 676 len. 4]: What lady ? ''
Parsing [sent. 677 len. 11]: `` The lady who passed the inn three days ago .
Parsing [sent. 678 len. 10]: I spoke of her then , you remember . ''
Parsing [sent. 679 len. 6]: `` Tonnerre de Dieu ! ''
Parsing [sent. 680 len. 38]: Keredec slapped his thigh with the sudden violence of a man who remembers that he has forgotten something , and as a final addition to my amazement , his voice rang more of remorse than of reproach .
Parsing [sent. 681 len. 22]: `` Have I never told you that to follow strange ladies is one of the things you can not do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 682 len. 9]: `` That other monsieur '' shook his head .
Parsing [sent. 683 len. 10]: `` No , you have never told me that .
Parsing [sent. 684 len. 21]: I do not understand it , '' he said , adding irrelevantly , `` I believe this gentleman knows her .
Parsing [sent. 685 len. 10]: He says he thinks he has seen her . ''
Parsing [sent. 686 len. 20]: `` If you please , we must not trouble this gentleman about it , '' said the professor hastily .
Parsing [sent. 687 len. 20]: `` Put on your hat , in the name of a thousand saints , and let us go ! ''
Parsing [sent. 688 len. 25]: `` But I wish to ask him her name , '' urged the other , with something curiously like the obstinacy of a child .
Parsing [sent. 689 len. 11]: `` I wish -- '' `` No , no ! ''
Parsing [sent. 690 len. 7]: Keredec took him by the arm .
Parsing [sent. 691 len. 5]: `` We must go .
Parsing [sent. 692 len. 9]: We shall be late for our dinner . ''
Parsing [sent. 693 len. 5]: `` But why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 694 len. 5]: persisted the young man .
Parsing [sent. 695 len. 5]: `` Not now ! ''
Parsing [sent. 696 len. 29]: The professor removed his broad felt hat and hurriedly wiped his vast and steaming brow -- a magnificent structure , corniced , at this moment , with anxiety .
Parsing [sent. 697 len. 13]: `` It is better if we do not discuss it now . ''
Parsing [sent. 698 len. 10]: `` But I might not meet him again . ''
Parsing [sent. 699 len. 41]: Professor Keredec turned toward me with a half-desperate , half - apologetic laugh which was like the rumbling of heavy wagons over a block pavement ; and in his flustered face I thought I read a signal of genuine distress .
Parsing [sent. 700 len. 15]: `` I do not know the lady , '' I said with some sharpness .
Parsing [sent. 701 len. 11]: `` I have never seen her until this afternoon . ''
Parsing [sent. 702 len. 13]: Upon this `` that other monsieur '' astonished me in good earnest .
Parsing [sent. 703 len. 31]: Searching my eyes eagerly with his clear , inquisitive gaze , he took a step toward me and said : `` You are sure you are telling the truth ? ''
Parsing [sent. 704 len. 19]: The professor uttered an exclamation of horror , sprang forward , and clutched his friend 's arm again .
Parsing [sent. 705 len. 4]: `` Malheureux ! ''
Parsing [sent. 706 len. 20]: he cried , and then to me : `` Sir , you will give him pardon if you can ?
Parsing [sent. 707 len. 9]: He has no meaning to be rude . ''
Parsing [sent. 708 len. 4]: `` Rude ? ''
Parsing [sent. 709 len. 11]: The young man 's voice showed both astonishment and pain .
Parsing [sent. 710 len. 5]: `` Was that rude ?
Parsing [sent. 711 len. 5]: I did n't know .
Parsing [sent. 712 len. 11]: I did n't mean to be rude , God knows !
Parsing [sent. 713 len. 15]: Ah , '' he said sadly , `` I do nothing but make mistakes .
Parsing [sent. 714 len. 8]: I hope you will forgive me . ''
Parsing [sent. 715 len. 51]: He lifted his hand as if in appeal , and let it drop to his side ; and in the action , as well as in the tone of his voice and his attitude of contrition , there was something that reached me suddenly , with the touch of pathos .
Parsing [sent. 716 len. 8]: `` Never mind , '' I said .
Parsing [sent. 717 len. 12]: `` I am only sorry that it was the truth . ''
Parsing [sent. 718 len. 14]: `` Thank you , '' he said , and turned humbly to Keredec .
Parsing [sent. 719 len. 8]: `` Ha , that is better ! ''
Parsing [sent. 720 len. 12]: shouted the great man , apparently relieved of a vast weight .
Parsing [sent. 721 len. 12]: `` We shall go home now and eat a good dinner .
Parsing [sent. 722 len. 46]: But first -- '' his silver-rimmed spectacles twinkled upon me , and he bent his Brobdingnagian back in a bow which against my will reminded me of the curtseys performed by Orloff 's dancing bears -- `` first let me speak some words for myself .
Parsing [sent. 723 len. 31]: My dear sir '' -- he addressed himself to me with grave formality -- `` do not suppose I have no realization that other excuses should be made to you .
Parsing [sent. 724 len. 7]: Believe me , they shall be .
Parsing [sent. 725 len. 22]: It is now that I see it is fortunate for us that you are our fellow-innsman at Les Trois Pigeons . ''
Parsing [sent. 726 len. 32]: I was unable to resist the opportunity , and , affecting considerable surprise , interrupted him with the apparently guileless query : `` Why , how did you know that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 727 len. 28]: Professor Keredec 's laughter rumbled again , growing deeper and louder till it reverberated in the woods and a hundred hale old trees laughed back at him .
Parsing [sent. 728 len. 8]: `` Ho , ho , ho ! ''
Parsing [sent. 729 len. 3]: he shouted .
Parsing [sent. 730 len. 14]: `` But you shall not take me for a window - curtain spy !
Parsing [sent. 731 len. 11]: That is a fine reputation I give myself with you !
Parsing [sent. 732 len. 5]: Ho , ho ! ''
Parsing [sent. 733 len. 24]: Then , followed submissively by `` that other monsieur , '' he strode into the path and went thundering forth through the forest .
Parsing [sent. 734 len. 45]: CHAPTER VI No doubt the most absurd thing I could have done after the departure of Professor Keredec and his singular friend would have been to settle myself before my canvas again with the intention of painting -- and that is what I did .
Parsing [sent. 735 len. 22]: At least , I resumed my camp-stool and went through some of the motions habitually connected with the act of painting .
Parsing [sent. 736 len. 46]: I remember that the first time in my juvenile reading I came upon the phrase , `` seated in a brown study , '' I pictured my hero in a brown chair , beside a brown table , in a room hung with brown paper .
Parsing [sent. 737 len. 29]: Later , being enlightened , I was ambitious to display the figure myself , but the uses of ordinary correspondence allowed the occasion for it to remain unoffered .
Parsing [sent. 738 len. 35]: Let me not only seize upon the present opportunity but gild it , for the adventure of the afternoon left me in a study which was , at its mildest , a profound purple .
Parsing [sent. 739 len. 51]: The confession has been made of my curiosity concerning my fellow - lodgers at Les Trois Pigeons ; however , it had been comparatively a torpid growth ; my meeting with them served to enlarge it so suddenly and to such proportions that I wonder it did not strangle me .
Parsing [sent. 740 len. 27]: In fine , I sat there brush-paddling my failure like an automaton , and saying over and over aloud , `` What is wrong with him ?
Parsing [sent. 741 len. 7]: What is wrong with him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 742 len. 32]: This was the sillier inasmuch as the word `` wrong '' -LRB- bearing any significance of a darkened mind -RRB- had not the slightest application to `` that other monsieur . ''
Parsing [sent. 743 len. 50]: There had been neither darkness nor dullness ; his eyes , his expression , his manner , betrayed no hint of wildness ; rather they bespoke a quick and amiable intelligence -- the more amazing that he had shown himself ignorant of things a child of ten would know .
Parsing [sent. 744 len. 69]: Amedee and his fellows of Les Trois Pigeons had judged wrongly of his nationality ; his face was of the lean , right , American structure ; but they had hit the relation between the two men : Keredec was the master and `` that other monsieur '' the scholar -- a pupil studying boys ' textbooks and receiving instruction in matters and manners that children are taught .
Parsing [sent. 745 len. 16]: And yet I could not believe him to be a simple case of arrested development .
Parsing [sent. 746 len. 22]: For the matter of that , I did not like to think of him as a `` case '' at all .
Parsing [sent. 747 len. 53]: There had been something about his bright youthfulness -- perhaps it was his quick contrition for his rudeness , perhaps it was a certain wistful quality he had , perhaps it was his very `` singularity '' -- which appealed as directly to my liking as it did urgently to my sympathy .
Parsing [sent. 748 len. 101]: I came out of my vari-coloured study with a start , caused by the discovery that I had absent-mindedly squeezed upon my palette the entire contents of an expensive tube of cobalt violet , for which I had no present use ; and sighing -LRB- for , of necessity , I am an economical man -RRB- , I postponed both of my problems till another day , determined to efface the one with a palette knife and a rag soaked in turpentine , and to defer the other until I should know more of my fellow-lodgers at Madame Brossard 's .
Parsing [sent. 749 len. 38]: The turpentine rag at least proved effective ; I scoured away the last tokens of my failure with it , wishing that life were like the canvas and that men had knowledge of the right celestial turpentine .
Parsing [sent. 750 len. 34]: After that I cleaned my brushes , packed and shouldered my kit , and , with a final imprecation upon all sausage-sandwiches , took up my way once more to Les Trois Pigeons .
Parsing [sent. 751 len. 38]: Presently I came upon an intersecting path where , on my previous excursions , I had always borne to the right ; but this evening , thinking to discover a shorter cut , I went straight ahead .
Parsing [sent. 752 len. 71]: Striding along at a good gait and chanting sonorously , `` On Linden when the sun was low , '' I left the rougher boscages of the forest behind me and emerged , just at sunset , upon an orderly fringe of woodland where the ground was neat and unencumbered , and the trimmed trees stood at polite distances , bowing slightly to one another with small , well-bred rustlings .
Parsing [sent. 753 len. 20]: The light was somewhere between gold and pink when I came into this lady 's boudoir of a grove .
Parsing [sent. 754 len. 34]: `` Isar flowing rapidly '' ceased its tumult abruptly , and Linden saw no sterner sight that evening : my voice and my feet stopped simultaneously -- for I stood upon Quesnay ground .
Parsing [sent. 755 len. 16]: Before me stretched a short broad avenue of turf , leading to the chateau gates .
Parsing [sent. 756 len. 38]: These stood open , a gravelled driveway climbing thence by easy stages between kempt shrubberies to the crest of the hill , where the gray roof and red chimney-pots of the chateau were glimpsed among the tree-tops .
Parsing [sent. 757 len. 37]: The slope was terraced with strips of flower-gardens and intervals of sward ; and against the green of a rising lawn I marked the figure of a woman , pausing to bend over some flowering bush .
Parsing [sent. 758 len. 31]: The figure was too slender to be mistaken for that of the present chatelaine of Quesnay : in Miss Elizabeth 's regal amplitude there was never any hint of fragility .
Parsing [sent. 759 len. 30]: The lady upon the slope , then , I concluded , must be Madame d'Armand , the inspiration of Amedee 's `` Monsieur has much to live for ! ''
Parsing [sent. 760 len. 51]: Once more this day I indorsed that worthy man 's opinion , for , though I was too far distant to see clearly , I knew that roses trimmed Madame d'Armand 's white hat , and that she had passed me , no long time since , in the forest .
Parsing [sent. 761 len. 6]: I took off my cap .
Parsing [sent. 762 len. 14]: `` I have the honour to salute you , '' I said aloud .
Parsing [sent. 763 len. 19]: `` I make my apologies for misbehaving with sandwiches and camp-stools in your presence , Madame d'Armand . ''
Parsing [sent. 764 len. 33]: Something in my own pronunciation of her name struck me as reminiscent : save for the prefix , it had sounded like `` Harman , '' as a Frenchman might pronounce it .
Parsing [sent. 765 len. 9]: Foreign names involve the French in terrible difficulties .
Parsing [sent. 766 len. 27]: Hughes , an English friend of mine , has lived in France some five-and-thirty years without reconciling himself to being known as `` Monsieur Ig . ''
Parsing [sent. 767 len. 15]: `` Armand '' might easily be Jean Ferret 's translation of `` Harman . ''
Parsing [sent. 768 len. 24]: Had he and Amedee in their admiration conferred the prefix because they considered it a plausible accompaniment to the lady 's gentle bearing ?
Parsing [sent. 769 len. 14]: It was not impossible ; it was , I concluded , very probable .
Parsing [sent. 770 len. 32]: I had come far out of my way , so I retraced my steps to the intersection of the paths , and thence made for the inn by my accustomed route .
Parsing [sent. 771 len. 34]: The light failed under the roofing of foliage long before I was free of the woods , and I emerged upon the road to Les Trois Pigeons when twilight had turned to dusk .
Parsing [sent. 772 len. 57]: Not far along the road from where I came into it , stood an old , brown , deep-thatched cottage -- a branch of brushwood over the door prettily beckoning travellers to the knowledge that cider was here for the thirsty ; and as I drew near I perceived that one availed himself of the invitation .
Parsing [sent. 773 len. 53]: A group stood about the open door , the lamp-light from within disclosing the head of the house filling a cup for the wayfarer ; while honest Mere Baudry and two generations of younger Baudrys clustered to miss no word of the interchange of courtesies between Pere Baudry and his chance patron .
Parsing [sent. 774 len. 91]: It afforded me some surprise to observe that the latter was a most mundane and elaborate wayfarer , indeed ; a small young man very lightly made , like a jockey , and point-device in khaki , puttees , pongee cap , white-and-green stock , a knapsack on his back , and a bamboo stick under his arm ; altogether equipped to such a high point of pedestrianism that a cynical person might have been reminded of loud calls for wine at some hostelry in the land of opera bouffe .
Parsing [sent. 775 len. 47]: He was speaking fluently , though with a detestable accent , in a rough-and-ready , pick-up dialect of Parisian slang , evidently under the pleasant delusion that he employed the French language , while Pere Baudry contributed his share of the conversation in a slow patois .
Parsing [sent. 776 len. 65]: As both men spoke at the same time and neither understood two consecutive words the other said , it struck me that the dialogue might prove unproductive of any highly important results this side of Michaelmas ; therefore , discovering that the very pedestrian gentleman was making some sort of inquiry concerning Les Trois Pigeons , I came to a halt and proffered aid .
Parsing [sent. 777 len. 10]: `` Are you looking for Madame Brossard 's ? ''
Parsing [sent. 778 len. 5]: I asked in English .
Parsing [sent. 779 len. 16]: The traveller uttered an exclamation and faced about with a jump , birdlike for quickness .
Parsing [sent. 780 len. 22]: He did not reply to my question with the same promptness ; however , his deliberation denoted scrutiny , not sloth .
Parsing [sent. 781 len. 11]: He stood peering at me sharply until I repeated it .
Parsing [sent. 782 len. 32]: Even then he protracted his examination of me , a favour I was unable to return with any interest , owing to the circumstance of his back being toward the light .
Parsing [sent. 783 len. 47]: Nevertheless , I got a clear enough impression of his alert , well-poised little figure , and of a hatchety little face , and a pair of shrewd little eyes , which -LRB- I thought -RRB- held a fine little conceit of his whole little person .
Parsing [sent. 784 len. 42]: It was a type of fellow-countryman not altogether unknown about certain `` American Bars '' of Paris , and usually connected -LRB- more or less directly -RRB- with what is known to the people of France as `` le Sport . ''
Parsing [sent. 785 len. 31]: `` Say , '' he responded in a voice of unpleasant nasality , finally deciding upon speech , `` you 're ` Nummeric ` n , ai n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 786 len. 7]: `` Yes , '' I returned .
Parsing [sent. 787 len. 23]: `` I thought I heard you inquiring for -- '' `` Well , m ' friend , you can sting me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 788 len. 6]: he interrupted with condescending jocularity .
Parsing [sent. 789 len. 16]: `` My style French does f ' r them camels up in Paris all right .
Parsing [sent. 790 len. 22]: ME at Nice , Monte Carlo , Chantilly -- bow to the p ` fess ` r ; he 's RIGHT !
Parsing [sent. 791 len. 22]: But down here I do n't seem to be GUD enough f ' r these sheep-dogs ; anyway they bark different .
Parsing [sent. 792 len. 13]: I 'm lukkin ' fer a hotel called Les Trois Pigeons . ''
Parsing [sent. 793 len. 19]: `` I am going there , '' I said ; `` I will show you the way . ''
Parsing [sent. 794 len. 7]: `` Whur is ` t ? ''
Parsing [sent. 795 len. 6]: he asked , not moving .
Parsing [sent. 796 len. 14]: I pointed to the lights of the inn , flickering across the fields .
Parsing [sent. 797 len. 36]: `` Yonder -- beyond the second turn of the road , '' I said , and , as he showed no signs of accompanying me , I added , `` I am rather late . ''
Parsing [sent. 798 len. 13]: `` Oh , I ai n't goin ' there t ` night .
Parsing [sent. 799 len. 18]: It 's too dark t ' see anything now , '' he remarked , to my astonishment .
Parsing [sent. 800 len. 16]: `` Dives and the choo-choo back t ' little ole Trouville f ' r mine !
Parsing [sent. 801 len. 15]: I on ' y wanted to take a LUK at this pigeon-house joint . ''
Parsing [sent. 802 len. 23]: `` Do you mind my inquiring , '' I said , `` what you expected to see at Les Trois Pigeons ? ''
Parsing [sent. 803 len. 4]: `` Why ! ''
Parsing [sent. 804 len. 16]: he exclaimed , as if astonished at the question , `` I 'm a tourist .
Parsing [sent. 805 len. 15]: Makin ' a pedestrun trip t ' all the reg ` ler sights . ''
Parsing [sent. 806 len. 19]: And , inspired to eloquence , he added , as an afterthought : `` As it were . ''
Parsing [sent. 807 len. 5]: `` A tourist ? ''
Parsing [sent. 808 len. 7]: I echoed , with perfect incredulity .
Parsing [sent. 809 len. 16]: `` That 's whut I am , m ' friend , '' he returned firmly .
Parsing [sent. 810 len. 30]: `` You do n't have to have a red dope-book in one hand and a thoid-class choo-choo ticket in the other to be a tourist , do you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 811 len. 31]: `` But if you will pardon me , '' I said , `` where did you get the notion that Les Trois Pigeons is one of the regular sights ? ''
Parsing [sent. 812 len. 10]: `` Ai n't it in all the books ? ''
Parsing [sent. 813 len. 16]: `` I do n't think that it is mentioned in any of the guide-books . ''
Parsing [sent. 814 len. 3]: `` NO !
Parsing [sent. 815 len. 18]: I did n't say it WAS , m ' friend , '' he retorted with contemptuous pity .
Parsing [sent. 816 len. 6]: `` I mean them history-books .
Parsing [sent. 817 len. 9]: It 's in all o ' THEM ! ''
Parsing [sent. 818 len. 21]: `` This is strange news , '' said I. `` I should be very much interested to read them ! ''
Parsing [sent. 819 len. 38]: `` Lookahere , '' he said , taking a step nearer me ; `` in oinest now , on your woid : Didn ' more 'n half them Jeanne d'Arc tamales live at that hotel wunst ? ''
Parsing [sent. 820 len. 28]: `` Nobody of historical importance -- or any other kind of importance , so far as I know -- ever lived there , '' I informed him .
Parsing [sent. 821 len. 19]: `` The older portions of the inn once belonged to an ancient farm-house , that is all . ''
Parsing [sent. 822 len. 27]: `` On the level , '' he demanded , `` did n't that William the Conker nor NONE o ' them ancient gilt-edges live there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 823 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 824 len. 5]: `` Stung again ! ''
Parsing [sent. 825 len. 10]: He broke into a sudden loud cackle of laughter .
Parsing [sent. 826 len. 3]: `` Why !
Parsing [sent. 827 len. 21]: the feller tole me ` at this here Pigeon place was all three rings when it come t ' history .
Parsing [sent. 828 len. 2]: Yessir !
Parsing [sent. 829 len. 40]: Tall , thin feller he was , in a three-button cutaway , English make , and kind of red-complected , with a sandy MUS - tache , '' pursued the pedestrian , apparently fearing his narrative might lack colour .
Parsing [sent. 830 len. 98]: `` I met him right comin ' out o ' the Casino at Trouville , yes ` day aft ` noon ; c ` udn ' a ' b ` en more 'n four o'clock -- hol ' on though , yes 't was , 't was nearer five , about twunty minutes t ' five , say -- an ' this feller tells me -- '' He cackled with laughter as palpably disingenuous as the corroborative details he thought necessary to muster , then he became serious , as if marvelling at his own wondrous verdancy .
Parsing [sent. 831 len. 14]: `` M ' friend , that feller soitn ' y found me easy .
Parsing [sent. 832 len. 48]: But he ca n't say I ai n't game ; he passes me the limes , but I 'm jest man enough to drink his health fer it in this sweet , sound ole-fashioned cider ` at ai n't got a headache in a barrel of it .
Parsing [sent. 833 len. 12]: He played me GUD , and here 's TO him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 834 len. 51]: Despite the heartiness of the sentiment , my honest tourist 's enthusiasm seemed largely histrionic , and his quaffing of the beaker too reminiscent of drain-the-wine-cup-free in the second row of the chorus , for he absently allowed it to dangle from his hand before raising it to his lips .
Parsing [sent. 835 len. 58]: However , not all of its contents was spilled , and he swallowed a mouthful of the sweet , sound , old-fashioned cider -- but by mistake , I was led to suppose , from the expression of displeasure which became so deeply marked upon his countenance as to be noticeable , even in the feeble lamplight .
Parsing [sent. 836 len. 24]: I tarried no longer , but bidding this good youth and the generations of Baudry good-night , hastened on to my belated dinner .
Parsing [sent. 837 len. 41]: `` Amedee , '' I said , when my cigar was lighted and the usual hour of consultation had arrived ; `` is n't that old lock on the chest where Madame Brossard keeps her silver getting rather rusty ? ''
Parsing [sent. 838 len. 9]: `` Monsieur , we have no thieves here .
Parsing [sent. 839 len. 8]: We are out of the world . ''
Parsing [sent. 840 len. 12]: `` Yes , but Trouville is not so far away . ''
Parsing [sent. 841 len. 4]: `` Truly . ''
Parsing [sent. 842 len. 28]: `` Many strange people go to Trouville : grand-dukes , millionaires , opera singers , princes , jockeys , gamblers -- '' `` Truly , truly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 843 len. 8]: `` And tourists , '' I finished .
Parsing [sent. 844 len. 12]: `` That is well known , '' assented Amedee , nodding .
Parsing [sent. 845 len. 24]: `` It follows , '' I continued with the impressiveness of all logicians , `` that many strange people may come from Trouville .
Parsing [sent. 846 len. 22]: In their excursions to the surrounding points of interest -- '' `` Eh , monsieur , but that is true ! ''
Parsing [sent. 847 len. 24]: he interrupted , laying his right forefinger across the bridge of his nose , which was his gesture when he remembered anything suddenly .
Parsing [sent. 848 len. 14]: `` There was a strange monsieur from Trouville here this very day . ''
Parsing [sent. 849 len. 9]: `` What kind of person was he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 850 len. 14]: `` A foreigner , but I could not tell from what country . ''
Parsing [sent. 851 len. 10]: `` What time of day was he here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 852 len. 7]: I asked , with growing interest .
Parsing [sent. 853 len. 8]: `` Toward the middle of the afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 854 len. 12]: I was alone , except for Glouglou , when he came .
Parsing [sent. 855 len. 27]: He wished to see the whole house and I showed him what I could , except of course monsieur 's pavilion , and the Grande Suite .
Parsing [sent. 856 len. 39]: Monsieur the Professor and that other monsieur had gone to the forest , but I did not feel at liberty to exhibit their rooms without Madame Brossard 's permission , and she was spending the day at Dives .
Parsing [sent. 857 len. 28]: Besides , '' added the good man , languidly snapping a napkin at a moth near one of the candles , `` the doors were locked . ''
Parsing [sent. 858 len. 8]: `` This person was a tourist ? ''
Parsing [sent. 859 len. 23]: I asked , after a pause during which Amedee seemed peacefully unaware of the rather concentrated gaze I had fixed upon him .
Parsing [sent. 860 len. 5]: `` Of a kind .
Parsing [sent. 861 len. 23]: In speaking he employed many peculiar expressions , more like a thief of a Parisian cabman than of the polite world . ''
Parsing [sent. 862 len. 7]: `` The devil he did ! ''
Parsing [sent. 863 len. 16]: said I. `` Did he tell you why he wished to see the whole house ?
Parsing [sent. 864 len. 8]: Did he contemplate taking rooms here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 865 len. 13]: `` No , monsieur , it appears that his interest was historical .
Parsing [sent. 866 len. 40]: At first I should not have taken him for a man of learning , yet he gave me a great piece of information ; a thing quite new to me , though I have lived here so many years .
Parsing [sent. 867 len. 45]: We are distinguished in history , it seems , and at one time both William the Conqueror and that brave Jeanne d'Arc -- '' I interrupted sharply , dropping my cigar and leaning across the table : `` How was this person dressed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 868 len. 11]: `` Monsieur , he was very much the pedestrian . ''
Parsing [sent. 869 len. 53]: And so , for that evening , we had something to talk about besides `` that other monsieur '' ; indeed , we found our subject so absorbing that I forgot to ask Amedee whether it was he or Jean Ferret who had prefixed the `` de '' to `` Armand . ''
Parsing [sent. 870 len. 28]: CHAPTER VII The cat that fell from the top of the Washington monument , and scampered off unhurt was killed by a dog at the next corner .
Parsing [sent. 871 len. 73]: Thus a certain painter-man , winged with canvases and easel , might have been seen to depart hurriedly from a poppy-sprinkled field , an infuriated Norman stallion in close attendance , and to fly safely over a stone wall of good height , only to turn his ankle upon an unconsidered pebble , some ten paces farther on ; the nose of the stallion projected over the wall , snorting joy thereat .
Parsing [sent. 872 len. 21]: The ankle was one which had turned aforetime ; it was an old weakness : moreover , it was mine .
Parsing [sent. 873 len. 5]: I was the painter-man .
Parsing [sent. 874 len. 49]: I could count on little less than a week of idleness within the confines of Les Trois Pigeons ; and reclining among cushions in a wicker long - chair looking out from my pavilion upon the drowsy garden on a hot noontide , I did not much care .
Parsing [sent. 875 len. 25]: It was cooler indoors , comfortable enough ; the open door framed the courtyard where pigeons were strutting on the gravel walks between flower-beds .
Parsing [sent. 876 len. 33]: Beyond , and thrown deeper into the perspective by the outer frame of the great archway , road and fields and forest fringes were revealed , lying tremulously in the hot sunshine .
Parsing [sent. 877 len. 49]: The foreground gained a human -LRB- though not lively -RRB- interest from the ample figure of our maitre d'hotel reposing in a rustic chair which had enjoyed the shade of an arbour about an hour earlier , when first occupied , but now stood in the broiling sun .
Parsing [sent. 878 len. 58]: At times Amedee 's upper eyelids lifted as much as the sixteenth of an inch , and he made a hazy gesture as if to wave the sun away , or , when the table-cloth upon his left arm slid slowly earthward , he adjusted it with a petulant jerk , without material interruption to his siesta .
Parsing [sent. 879 len. 42]: Meanwhile Glouglou , rolling and smoking cigarettes in the shade of a clump of lilac , watched with button eyes the noddings of his superior , and , at the cost of some convulsive writhings , constrained himself to silent laughter .
Parsing [sent. 880 len. 27]: A heavy step crunched the gravel and I heard my name pronounced in a deep inquiring rumble -- the voice of Professor Keredec , no less .
Parsing [sent. 881 len. 38]: Nor was I greatly surprised , since our meeting in the forest had led me to expect some advances on his part toward friendliness , or , at least , in the direction of a better acquaintance .
Parsing [sent. 882 len. 17]: However , I withheld my reply for a moment to make sure I had heard aright .
Parsing [sent. 883 len. 5]: The name was repeated .
Parsing [sent. 884 len. 22]: `` Here I am , '' I called , `` in the pavilion , if you wish to see me . ''
Parsing [sent. 885 len. 3]: `` Aha !
Parsing [sent. 886 len. 12]: I hear you become an invalid , my dear sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 887 len. 16]: With that the professor 's great bulk loomed in the doorway against the glare outside .
Parsing [sent. 888 len. 15]: `` I have come to condole with you , if you allow it . ''
Parsing [sent. 889 len. 20]: `` To smoke with me , too , I hope , '' I said , not a little pleased .
Parsing [sent. 890 len. 20]: `` That I will do , '' he returned , and came in slowly , walking with perceptible lameness .
Parsing [sent. 891 len. 33]: `` The sympathy I offer is genuine : it is not only from the heart , it is from the latissimus dorsi '' he continued , seating himself with a cavernous groan .
Parsing [sent. 892 len. 12]: `` I am your confrere in illness , my dear sir .
Parsing [sent. 893 len. 13]: I have choosed this fine weather for rheumatism of the back . ''
Parsing [sent. 894 len. 9]: `` I hope it is not painful . ''
Parsing [sent. 895 len. 24]: `` Ha , it is so-so , '' he rumbled , removing his spectacles and wiping his eyes , dazzled by the sun .
Parsing [sent. 896 len. 15]: `` There is more of me than of most men -- more to suffer .
Parsing [sent. 897 len. 25]: Nature was generous to the little germs when she made this big Keredec ; she offered them room for their campaigns of war . ''
Parsing [sent. 898 len. 8]: `` You 'll take a cigarette ? ''
Parsing [sent. 899 len. 17]: `` I thank you ; if you do not mind , I smoke my pipe . ''
Parsing [sent. 900 len. 49]: He took from his pocket a worn leather case , which he opened , disclosing a small , browned clay bowl of the kind workmen use ; and , fitting it with a red stem , he filled it with a dark and sinister tobacco from a pouch .
Parsing [sent. 901 len. 29]: `` Always my pipe for me , '' he said , and applied a match , inhaling the smoke as other men inhale the light smoke of cigarettes .
Parsing [sent. 902 len. 7]: `` Ha , it is good !
Parsing [sent. 903 len. 16]: It is wicked for the insides , but it is good for the soul . ''
Parsing [sent. 904 len. 29]: And clouds wreathed his great beard like a storm on Mont Blanc as he concluded , with gusto , `` It is my first pipe since yesterday . ''
Parsing [sent. 905 len. 21]: `` That is being a good smoker , '' I ventured sententiously ; `` to whet indulgence with abstinence . ''
Parsing [sent. 906 len. 23]: `` My dear sir , '' he protested , `` I am a man without even enough virtue to be an epicure .
Parsing [sent. 907 len. 17]: When I am alone I am a chimney with no hebdomadary repose ; I smoke forever .
Parsing [sent. 908 len. 14]: It is on account of my young friend I am temperate now . ''
Parsing [sent. 909 len. 11]: `` He has never smoked , your young friend ? ''
Parsing [sent. 910 len. 13]: I asked , glancing at my visitor rather curiously , I fear .
Parsing [sent. 911 len. 8]: `` Mr. Saffren has no vices . ''
Parsing [sent. 912 len. 15]: Professor Keredec replaced his silver-rimmed spectacles and turned them upon me with serene benevolence .
Parsing [sent. 913 len. 36]: `` He is in good condition , all pure , like little children -- and so if I smoke near him he chokes and has water at the eyes , though he does not complain .
Parsing [sent. 914 len. 30]: Just now I take a vacation : it is his hour for study , but I think he looks more out of the front window than at his book .
Parsing [sent. 915 len. 58]: He looks very much from the window '' -- there was a muttering of subterranean thunder somewhere , which I was able to locate in the professor 's torso , and took to be his expression of a chuckle -- `` yes , very much , since the passing of that charming lady some days ago . ''
Parsing [sent. 916 len. 12]: `` You say your young friend 's name is Saffren ? ''
Parsing [sent. 917 len. 5]: `` Oliver Saffren . ''
Parsing [sent. 918 len. 46]: The benevolent gaze continued to rest upon me , but a shadow like a faint anxiety darkened the Homeric brow , and an odd notion entered my mind -LRB- without any good reason -RRB- that Professor Keredec was wondering what I thought of the name .
Parsing [sent. 919 len. 37]: I uttered some commonplace syllable of no moment , and there ensued a pause during which the seeming shadow upon my visitor 's forehead became a reality , deepening to a look of perplexity and trouble .
Parsing [sent. 920 len. 20]: Finally he said abruptly : `` It is about him that I have come to talk to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 921 len. 24]: `` I shall be very glad , '' I murmured , but he brushed the callow formality aside with a gesture of remonstrance .
Parsing [sent. 922 len. 20]: `` Ha , my dear sir , '' he cried ; `` but you are a man of feeling !
Parsing [sent. 923 len. 18]: We are both old enough to deal with more than just these little words of the mouth !
Parsing [sent. 924 len. 58]: It was the way you have received my poor young gentleman 's excuses when he was so rude , which make me wish to talk with you on such a subject ; it is why I would not have you believe Mr. Saffren and me two very suspected individuals who hide here like two bad criminals ! ''
Parsing [sent. 925 len. 10]: `` No , no , '' I protested hastily .
Parsing [sent. 926 len. 35]: `` The name of Professor Keredec -- '' `` The name of NO man , '' he thundered , interrupting , `` can protect his reputation when he is caught peeping from a curtain !
Parsing [sent. 927 len. 6]: Ha , my dear sir !
Parsing [sent. 928 len. 6]: I know what you think .
Parsing [sent. 929 len. 28]: You think , ` He is a nice fine man , that old professor , oh , very nice -- only he hides behind the curtains sometimes !
Parsing [sent. 930 len. 15]: Very fine man , oh , yes ; only he is a spy . '
Parsing [sent. 931 len. 2]: Eh ?
Parsing [sent. 932 len. 4]: Ha , ha !
Parsing [sent. 933 len. 13]: That is what you have been thinking , my dear sir ! ''
Parsing [sent. 934 len. 24]: `` Not at all , '' I laughed ; `` I thought you might fear that _ I _ was a spy . ''
Parsing [sent. 935 len. 4]: `` Eh ? ''
Parsing [sent. 936 len. 8]: He became sharply serious upon the instant .
Parsing [sent. 937 len. 8]: `` What made you think that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 938 len. 40]: `` I supposed you might be conducting some experiments , or perhaps writing a book which you wished to keep from the public for a time , and that possibly you might imagine that I was a reporter . ''
Parsing [sent. 939 len. 3]: `` So !
Parsing [sent. 940 len. 13]: And THAT is all , '' he returned , with evident relief .
Parsing [sent. 941 len. 24]: `` No , my dear sir , I was the spy ; it is the truth ; and I was spying upon you .
Parsing [sent. 942 len. 5]: I confess my shame .
Parsing [sent. 943 len. 19]: I wish very much to know what you were like , what kind of a man you are .
Parsing [sent. 944 len. 35]: And so , '' he concluded with an opening of the hands , palms upward , as if to show that nothing remained for concealment , `` and so I have watched you . ''
Parsing [sent. 945 len. 4]: `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 946 len. 3]: I asked .
Parsing [sent. 947 len. 12]: `` The explanation is so simple : it was necessary . ''
Parsing [sent. 948 len. 9]: `` Because of -- of Mr. Saffren ? ''
Parsing [sent. 949 len. 9]: I said slowly , and with some trepidation .
Parsing [sent. 950 len. 4]: `` Precisely . ''
Parsing [sent. 951 len. 8]: The professor exhaled a cloud of smoke .
Parsing [sent. 952 len. 23]: `` Because I am sensitive for him , and because in a certain way I am -- how should it be said ?
Parsing [sent. 953 len. 16]: -- perhaps it is near the truth to say , I am his guardian . ''
Parsing [sent. 954 len. 5]: `` I see . ''
Parsing [sent. 955 len. 19]: `` Forgive me , '' he rejoined quickly , `` but I am afraid you do not see .
Parsing [sent. 956 len. 10]: I am not his guardian by the law . ''
Parsing [sent. 957 len. 13]: `` I had not supposed that you were , '' I said .
Parsing [sent. 958 len. 5]: `` Why not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 959 len. 33]: `` Because , though he puzzled me and I do not understand his case -- his case , so to speak , I have not for a moment thought him insane . ''
Parsing [sent. 960 len. 12]: `` Ha , my dear sir , you are right ! ''
Parsing [sent. 961 len. 10]: exclaimed Keredec , beaming on me , much pleased .
Parsing [sent. 962 len. 25]: `` You are a thousand times right ; he is as sane as yourself or myself or as anybody in the whole wide world !
Parsing [sent. 963 len. 2]: Ha !
Parsing [sent. 964 len. 27]: he is now much MORE sane , for his mind is not yet confused and becobwebbed with the useless things you and I put into ours .
Parsing [sent. 965 len. 12]: It is open and clear like the little children 's mind .
Parsing [sent. 966 len. 7]: And it is a good mind !
Parsing [sent. 967 len. 15]: It is only a little learning , a little experience , that he lacks .
Parsing [sent. 968 len. 34]: A few months more -- ha , at the greatest , a year from now -- and he will not be different any longer ; he will be like the rest of us .
Parsing [sent. 969 len. 31]: Only '' -- the professor leaned forward and his big fist came down on the arm of his chair -- `` he shall be better than the rest of us !
Parsing [sent. 970 len. 32]: But if strange people were to see him now , '' he continued , leaning back and dropping his voice to a more confidential tone , `` it would not do .
Parsing [sent. 971 len. 16]: This poor world is full of fools ; there are so many who judge quickly .
Parsing [sent. 972 len. 40]: If they should see him now , they might think he is not just right in his brain ; and then , as it could happen so easily , those same people might meet him again after a while .
Parsing [sent. 973 len. 20]: ` Ha , ' they would say , ` there was a time when that young man was insane .
Parsing [sent. 974 len. 5]: I knew him ! '
Parsing [sent. 975 len. 14]: And so he might go through his life with those clouds over him .
Parsing [sent. 976 len. 26]: Those clouds are black clouds , they can make more harm than our old sins , and I wish to save my friend from them .
Parsing [sent. 977 len. 24]: So I have brought him here to this quiet place where nobody comes , and we can keep from meeting any foolish people .
Parsing [sent. 978 len. 39]: But , my dear sir '' -- he leaned forward again , and spoke emphatically -- `` it would be barbarous for men of intelligence to live in the same house and go always hiding from one another !
Parsing [sent. 979 len. 34]: Let us dine together this evening , if you will , and not only this evening but every evening you are willing to share with us and do not wish to be alone .
Parsing [sent. 980 len. 7]: It will be good for us .
Parsing [sent. 981 len. 19]: We are three men like hermits , far out of the world , but -- a thousand saints !
Parsing [sent. 982 len. 10]: -- let us be civilised to one another ! ''
Parsing [sent. 983 len. 10]: `` With all my heart , '' I said .
Parsing [sent. 984 len. 3]: `` Ha !
Parsing [sent. 985 len. 14]: I wish you to know my young man , '' Keredec went on .
Parsing [sent. 986 len. 23]: `` You will like him -- no man of feeling could keep himself from liking him -- and he is your fellow-countryman .
Parsing [sent. 987 len. 8]: I hope you will be his friend .
Parsing [sent. 988 len. 11]: He should make friends , for he needs them . ''
Parsing [sent. 989 len. 20]: `` I think he has a host of them , '' said I , `` in Professor Keredec . ''
Parsing [sent. 990 len. 16]: My visitor looked at me quizzically for a moment , shook his head and sighed .
Parsing [sent. 991 len. 16]: `` That is only one small man in a big body , that Professor Keredec .
Parsing [sent. 992 len. 23]: And yet , '' he went on sadly , `` it is all the friends that poor boy has in this world .
Parsing [sent. 993 len. 8]: You will dine with us to-night ? ''
Parsing [sent. 994 len. 22]: Acquiescing cheerfully , I added : `` You will join me at the table on my veranda , wo n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 995 len. 11]: I can hobble that far but not much farther . ''
Parsing [sent. 996 len. 16]: Before answering he cast a sidelong glance at the arrangement of things outside the door .
Parsing [sent. 997 len. 32]: The screen of honeysuckle ran partly across the front of the little porch , about half of which it concealed from the garden and consequently from the road beyond the archway .
Parsing [sent. 998 len. 35]: I saw that he took note of this before he pointed to that corner of the veranda most closely screened by the vines and said : `` May the table be placed yonder ? ''
Parsing [sent. 999 len. 16]: `` Certainly ; I often have it there , even when I am alone . ''
Parsing [sent. 1000 len. 11]: `` Ha , that is good , '' he exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 1001 len. 18]: `` It is not human for a Frenchman to eat in the house in good weather . ''
Parsing [sent. 1002 len. 21]: `` It is a pity , '' I said , `` that I should have been such a bugbear . ''
Parsing [sent. 1003 len. 64]: This remark was thoroughly disingenuous , for , although I did not doubt that anything he told me was perfectly true , nor that he had made as complete a revelation as he thought consistent with his duty toward the young man in his charge , I did not believe that his former precautions were altogether due to my presence at the inn .
Parsing [sent. 1004 len. 25]: And I was certain that while he might fear for his friend some chance repute of insanity , he had greater terrors than that .
Parsing [sent. 1005 len. 43]: As to their nature I had no clew ; nor was it my affair to be guessing ; but whatever they were , the days of security at Les Trois Pigeons had somewhat eased Professor Keredec 's mind in regard to them .
Parsing [sent. 1006 len. 27]: At least , his anxiety was sufficiently assuaged to risk dining out of doors with only my screen of honeysuckle between his charge and curious eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1007 len. 5]: So much was evident .
Parsing [sent. 1008 len. 14]: `` The reproach is deserved , '' he returned , after a pause .
Parsing [sent. 1009 len. 36]: `` It is to be wished that all our bugbears might offer as pleasant a revelation , if we had the courage , or the slyness '' -- he laughed -- `` to investigate . ''
Parsing [sent. 1010 len. 21]: I made a reply of similar gallantry and he got to his feet , rubbing his back as he rose .
Parsing [sent. 1011 len. 7]: `` Ha , I am old !
Parsing [sent. 1012 len. 2]: old !
Parsing [sent. 1013 len. 9]: Rheumatism in warm weather : that is ugly .
Parsing [sent. 1014 len. 17]: Now I must go to my boy and see what he can make of his Gibbon .
Parsing [sent. 1015 len. 4]: The poor fellow !
Parsing [sent. 1016 len. 15]: I think he finds the decay of Rome worse than rheumatism in summer ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1017 len. 43]: He replaced his pipe in its case , and promising heartily that it should not be the last he would smoke in my company and domain , was making slowly for the door when he paused at a sound from the road .
Parsing [sent. 1018 len. 10]: We heard the rapid hoof-beats of a mettled horse .
Parsing [sent. 1019 len. 31]: He crossed our vision and the open archway : a high-stepping hackney going well , driven by a lady in a light trap which was half full of wild flowers .
Parsing [sent. 1020 len. 65]: It was a quick picture , like a flash of the cinematograph , but the pose of the lady as a driver was seen to be of a commanding grace , and though she was not in white but in light blue , and her plain sailor hat was certainly not trimmed with roses , I had not the least difficulty in recognising her .
Parsing [sent. 1021 len. 53]: At the same instant there was a hurried clatter of foot-steps upon the stairway leading from the gallery ; the startled pigeons fluttered up from the garden-path , betaking themselves to flight , and `` that other monsieur '' came leaping across the courtyard , through the archway and into the road .
Parsing [sent. 1022 len. 3]: `` Glouglou !
Parsing [sent. 1023 len. 4]: Look quickly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1024 len. 18]: he called loudly , in French , as he came ; `` Who is that lady ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1025 len. 15]: Glouglou would have replied , but the words were taken out of his mouth .
Parsing [sent. 1026 len. 36]: Amedee awoke with a frantic start and launched himself at the archway , carroming from its nearest corner and hurtling onward at a speed which for once did not diminish in proportion to his progress .
Parsing [sent. 1027 len. 7]: `` That lady , monsieur ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1028 len. 24]: he gasped , checking himself at the young man 's side and gazing after the trap , `` that is Madame d'Armand . ''
Parsing [sent. 1029 len. 11]: `` Madame d'Armand , '' Saffren repeated the name slowly .
Parsing [sent. 1030 len. 8]: `` Her name is Madame d'Armand . ''
Parsing [sent. 1031 len. 24]: `` Yes , monsieur , '' said Amedee complacently ; `` it is an American lady who has married a French nobleman . ''
Parsing [sent. 1032 len. 22]: CHAPTER VIII Like most painters , I have supposed the tools of my craft harder to manipulate than those of others .
Parsing [sent. 1033 len. 19]: The use of words , particularly , seemed readier , handier for the contrivance of effects than pigments .
Parsing [sent. 1034 len. 59]: I thought the language of words less elusive than that of colour , leaving smaller margin for unintended effects ; and , believing in complacent good faith that words conveyed exact meanings exactly , it was my innocent conception that almost anything might be so described in words that all who read must inevitably perceive that thing precisely .
Parsing [sent. 1035 len. 58]: If this were true , there would be little work for the lawyers , who produce such tortured pages in the struggle to be definite , who swing riches from one family to another , save men from violent death or send them to it , and earn fortunes for themselves through the dangerous inadequacies of words .
Parsing [sent. 1036 len. 36]: I have learned how great was my mistake , and now I am wishing I could shift paper for canvas , that I might paint the young man who came to interest me so deeply .
Parsing [sent. 1037 len. 57]: I wish I might present him here in colour instead of trusting to this unstable business of words , so wily and undependable , with their shimmering values , that you can not turn your back upon them for two minutes but they will be shouting a hundred things which they were not meant to tell .
Parsing [sent. 1038 len. 57]: To make the best of necessity : what I have written of him -- my first impressions -- must be taken as the picture , although it be but a gossamer sketch in the air , instead of definite work with well-ground pigments to show forth a portrait , to make you see flesh and blood .
Parsing [sent. 1039 len. 47]: It must take the place of something contrived with my own tools to reveal what the following days revealed him to me , and what it was about him -LRB- evasive of description -RRB- which made me so soon , as Keredec wished , his friend .
Parsing [sent. 1040 len. 14]: Life among our kin and kind is made pleasanter by our daily platitudes .
Parsing [sent. 1041 len. 14]: Who is more tedious than the man incessantly struggling to avoid the banal ?
Parsing [sent. 1042 len. 50]: Nature rules that such a one will produce nothing better than epigram and paradox , saying old , old things in a new way , or merely shifting object for subject -- and his wife 's face , when he shines for a circle , is worth a glance .
Parsing [sent. 1043 len. 38]: With no further apology , I declare that I am a person who has felt few positive likes or dislikes for people in this life , and I did deeply like my fellow-lodgers at Les Trois Pigeons .
Parsing [sent. 1044 len. 77]: Liking for both men increased with acquaintance , and for the younger I came to feel , in addition , a kind of championship , doubtless in some measure due to what Keredec had told me of him , but more to that half - humourous sense of protectiveness that we always have for those young people whose untempered and innocent outlook makes us feel , as we say , `` a thousand years old . ''
Parsing [sent. 1045 len. 62]: The afternoon following our first dinner together , the two , in returning from their walk , came into the pavilion with cheerful greetings , instead of going to their rooms as usual , and Keredec , declaring that the open air had `` dispersed '' his rheumatism , asked if he might overhaul some of my little canvases and boards .
Parsing [sent. 1046 len. 45]: I explained that they consisted mainly of `` notes '' for future use , but consented willingly ; whereupon he arranged a number of them as for exhibition and delivered himself impromptu of the most vehemently instructive lecture on art I had ever heard .
Parsing [sent. 1047 len. 56]: Beginning with the family , the tribe , and the totem-pole , he was able to demonstrate a theory that art was not only useful to society but its primary necessity ; a curious thought , probably more attributable to the fact that he was a Frenchman than to that of his being a scientist .
Parsing [sent. 1048 len. 36]: `` And here , '' he said in the course of his demonstration , pointing to a sketch which I had made one morning just after sunrise -- `` here you can see real sunshine .
Parsing [sent. 1049 len. 20]: One certain day there came those few certain moment ' at the sunrise when the light was like this .
Parsing [sent. 1050 len. 9]: Those few moment ' , where are they ?
Parsing [sent. 1051 len. 8]: They have disappeared , gone for eternally .
Parsing [sent. 1052 len. 13]: They went '' -- he snapped his fingers -- `` like that .
Parsing [sent. 1053 len. 7]: Yet here they are -- ha !
Parsing [sent. 1054 len. 4]: -- forever ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1055 len. 48]: `` But it does n't look like sunshine , '' said Oliver Saffren hesitatingly , stating a disconcerting but incontrovertible truth ; `` it only seems to look like it because -- is n't it because it 's so much brighter than the rest of the picture ?
Parsing [sent. 1056 len. 10]: I doubt if paint CAN look like sunshine . ''
Parsing [sent. 1057 len. 18]: He turned from the sketch , caught Keredec 's gathering frown , and his face flushed painfully .
Parsing [sent. 1058 len. 4]: `` Ah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1059 len. 12]: he cried , `` I should n't have said it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1060 len. 30]: I interposed to reassure him , exclaiming that it were a godsend indeed , did all our critics merely speak the plain truth as they see it for themselves .
Parsing [sent. 1061 len. 13]: The professor would not have it so , and cut me off .
Parsing [sent. 1062 len. 12]: `` No , no , no , my dear sir ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1063 len. 3]: he shouted .
Parsing [sent. 1064 len. 17]: `` You speak with kindness , but you put some wrong ideas in his head ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1065 len. 7]: Saffren 's look of trouble deepened .
Parsing [sent. 1066 len. 10]: `` I do n't understand , '' he murmured .
Parsing [sent. 1067 len. 17]: `` I thought you said always to speak the truth just as I see it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1068 len. 18]: `` I have telled you , '' Keredec declared vehemently , `` nothing of the kind ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1069 len. 10]: `` But only yesterday -- '' `` Never ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1070 len. 12]: `` I understood -- '' `` Then you understood only one-half !
Parsing [sent. 1071 len. 17]: I say , ` Speak the truth as you see it , when you speak . '
Parsing [sent. 1072 len. 8]: I did not tell you to speak !
Parsing [sent. 1073 len. 13]: How much time have you give ' to study sunshine and paint ?
Parsing [sent. 1074 len. 8]: What do you know about them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1075 len. 9]: `` Nothing , '' answered the other humbly .
Parsing [sent. 1076 len. 36]: A profound rumbling was heard , and the frown disappeared from Professor Keredec 's brow like the vanishing of the shadow of a little cloud from the dome of some great benevolent and scientific institute .
Parsing [sent. 1077 len. 27]: He dropped a weighty hand on his young friend 's shoulder , and , in high good-humour , thundered : `` Then you are a critic !
Parsing [sent. 1078 len. 33]: Knowing nothing of sunshine except that it warms you , and never having touched paint , you are going to tell about them to a man who spends his life studying them !
Parsing [sent. 1079 len. 22]: You look up in the night and the truth you see is that the moon and stars are crossing the ocean .
Parsing [sent. 1080 len. 8]: You will tell that to the astronomer ?
Parsing [sent. 1081 len. 2]: Ha !
Parsing [sent. 1082 len. 8]: The truth is what the masters see .
Parsing [sent. 1083 len. 12]: When you know what they see , you may speak . ''
Parsing [sent. 1084 len. 32]: At dinner the night before , it had struck me that Saffren was a rather silent young man by habit , and now I thought I began to understand the reason .
Parsing [sent. 1085 len. 18]: I hinted as much , saying , `` That would make a quiet world of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1086 len. 10]: `` All the better , my dear sir ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1087 len. 38]: The professor turned beamingly upon me and continued , dropping into a Whistlerian mannerism that he had sometimes : `` You must not blame that great wind of a Keredec for preaching at other people to listen .
Parsing [sent. 1088 len. 13]: It gives the poor man more room for himself to talk ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1089 len. 7]: I found his talk worth hearing .
Parsing [sent. 1090 len. 109]: I would show you , if I could , our pleasant evenings of lingering , after coffee , behind the tremulous screen of honeysuckle , with the night very dark and quiet beyond the warm nimbus of our candle-light , the faces of my two companions clear-obscure in a mellow shadow like the middle tones of a Rembrandt , and the professor , good man , talking wonderfully of everything under the stars and over them , -- while Oliver Saffren and I sat under the spell of the big , kind voice , the young man listening with the same eagerness which marked him when he spoke .
Parsing [sent. 1091 len. 11]: It was an eagerness to understand , not to interrupt .
Parsing [sent. 1092 len. 5]: These were our evenings .
Parsing [sent. 1093 len. 34]: In the afternoons the two went for their walk as usual , though now they did not plunge out of sight of the main road with the noticeable haste which Amedee had described .
Parsing [sent. 1094 len. 13]: As time pressed , I perceived the caution of Keredec visibly slackening .
Parsing [sent. 1095 len. 43]: Whatever he had feared , the obscurity and continued quiet of LES TROIS PIGEONS reassured him ; he felt more and more secure in this sheltered retreat , `` far out of the world , '' and obviously thought no danger imminent .
Parsing [sent. 1096 len. 20]: So the days went by , uneventful for my new friends , -- days of warm idleness for me .
Parsing [sent. 1097 len. 11]: Let them go unnarrated ; we pass to the event .
Parsing [sent. 1098 len. 10]: My ankle had taken its wonted time to recover .
Parsing [sent. 1099 len. 35]: I was on my feet again and into the woods -- not traversing , on the way , a certain poppy - sprinkled field whence a fine Norman stallion snorted ridicule over a wall .
Parsing [sent. 1100 len. 12]: But the fortune of Keredec was to sink as I rose .
Parsing [sent. 1101 len. 15]: His summer rheumatism returned , came to grips with him , laid him low .
Parsing [sent. 1102 len. 24]: We hobbled together for a day or so , then I threw away my stick and he exchanged his for an improvised crutch .
Parsing [sent. 1103 len. 28]: By the time I was fit to run , he was able to do little better than to creep -- might well have taken to his bed .
Parsing [sent. 1104 len. 36]: But as he insisted that his pupil should not forego the daily long walks and the health of the forest , it came to pass that Saffren often made me the objective of his rambles .
Parsing [sent. 1105 len. 35]: At dinner he usually asked in what portion of the forest I should be painting late the next afternoon , and I got in the habit of expecting him to join me toward sunset .
Parsing [sent. 1106 len. 34]: We located each other through a code of yodeling that we arranged ; his part of these vocal gymnastics being very pleasant to hear , for he had a flexible , rich voice .
Parsing [sent. 1107 len. 14]: I shudder to recall how largely my own performances partook of the grotesque .
Parsing [sent. 1108 len. 51]: But in the forest where were no musical persons -LRB- I supposed -RRB- to take hurt from whatever noise I made , I would let go with all the lungs I had ; he followed the horrid sounds to their origin , and we would return to the inn together .
Parsing [sent. 1109 len. 73]: On these homeward walks I found him a good companion , and that is something not to be under-valued by a selfish man who lives for himself and his own little ways and his own little thoughts , and for very little else , -- which is the kind of man -LRB- as I have already confessed -RRB- that I was -- deserving the pity of all happily or unhappily married persons .
Parsing [sent. 1110 len. 48]: Responsive in kind to either a talkative mood or a silent one , always gentle in manner , and always unobtrusively melancholy , Saffren never took the initiative , though now and then he asked a question about some rather simple matter which might be puzzling him .
Parsing [sent. 1111 len. 25]: Whatever the answer , he usually received it in silence , apparently turning the thing over and over and inside out in his mind .
Parsing [sent. 1112 len. 28]: He was almost tremulously sensitive , yet not vain , for he was neither afraid nor ashamed to expose his ignorance , his amazing lack of experience .
Parsing [sent. 1113 len. 13]: He had a greater trouble , one that I had not fathomed .
Parsing [sent. 1114 len. 53]: Sometimes there came over his face a look of importunate wistfulness and distressed perplexity , and he seemed on the point of breaking out with something that he wished to tell me -- or to ask me , for it might have been a question -- but he always kept it back .
Parsing [sent. 1115 len. 10]: Keredec 's training seldom lost its hold upon him .
Parsing [sent. 1116 len. 59]: I had gone back to my glade again , and to the thin sunshine , which came a little earlier , now that we were deep in July ; and one afternoon I sat in the mouth of the path , just where I had played the bounding harlequin for the benefit of the lovely visitor at Quesnay .
Parsing [sent. 1117 len. 22]: It was warm in the woods and quiet , warm with the heat of July , still with a July stillness .
Parsing [sent. 1118 len. 47]: The leaves had no motion ; if there were birds or insects within hearing they must have been asleep ; the quivering flight of a butterfly in that languid air seemed , by contrast , quite a commotion ; a humming-bird would have made a riot .
Parsing [sent. 1119 len. 43]: I heard the light snapping of a twig and a swish of branches from the direction in which I faced ; evidently some one was approaching the glade , though concealed from me for the moment by the winding of the path .
Parsing [sent. 1120 len. 39]: Taking it for Saffren , as a matter of course -LRB- for we had arranged to meet at that time and place -RRB- , I raised my voice in what I intended for a merry yodel of greeting .
Parsing [sent. 1121 len. 8]: I yodeled loud , I yodeled long .
Parsing [sent. 1122 len. 46]: Knowing my own deficiencies in this art , I had adopted the cunning sinner 's policy toward sin and made a joke of it : thus , since my best performance was not unsuggestive of calamity in the poultry yard , I made it worse .
Parsing [sent. 1123 len. 38]: And then and there , when my mouth was at its widest in the production of these shocking ulla-hootings , the person approaching came round a turn in the path , and within full sight of me .
Parsing [sent. 1124 len. 12]: To my ultimate , utmost horror , it was Madame d'Armand .
Parsing [sent. 1125 len. 10]: I grew so furiously red that it burned me .
Parsing [sent. 1126 len. 41]: I had not the courage to run , though I could have prayed that she might take me for what I seemed -- plainly a lunatic , whooping the lonely peace of the woods into pandemonium -- and turn back .
Parsing [sent. 1127 len. 43]: But she kept straight on , must inevitably reach the glade and cross it , and I calculated wretchedly that at the rate she was walking , unhurried but not lagging , it would be about thirty seconds before she passed me .
Parsing [sent. 1128 len. 45]: Then suddenly , while I waited in sizzling shame , a clear voice rang out from a distance in an answering yodel to mine , and I thanked heaven for its mercies ; at least she would see that my antics had some reason .
Parsing [sent. 1129 len. 69]: She stopped short , in a half-step , as if a little startled , one arm raised to push away a thin green branch that crossed the path at shoulder-height ; and her attitude was so charming as she paused , detained to listen by this other voice with its musical youthfulness , that for a second I thought crossly of all the young men in the world .
Parsing [sent. 1130 len. 31]: There was a final call , clear and loud as a bugle , and she turned to the direction whence it came , so that her back was toward me .
Parsing [sent. 1131 len. 19]: Then Oliver Saffren came running lightly round the turn of the path , near her and facing her .
Parsing [sent. 1132 len. 8]: He stopped as short as she had .
Parsing [sent. 1133 len. 14]: Her hand dropped from the slender branch , and pressed against her side .
Parsing [sent. 1134 len. 29]: He lifted his hat and spoke to her , and I thought she made some quick reply in a low voice , though I could not be sure .
Parsing [sent. 1135 len. 29]: She held that startled attitude a moment longer , then turned and crossed the glade so hurriedly that it was almost as if she ran away from him .
Parsing [sent. 1136 len. 29]: I had moved aside with my easel and camp-stool , but she passed close to me as she entered the path again on my side of the glade .
Parsing [sent. 1137 len. 28]: She did not seem to see me , her dark eyes stared widely straight ahead , her lips were parted , and she looked white and frightened .
Parsing [sent. 1138 len. 11]: She disappeared very quickly in the windings of the path .
Parsing [sent. 1139 len. 63]: CHAPTER IX He came on more slowly , his eyes following her as she vanished , then turning to me with a rather pitiful apprehension -- a look like that I remember to have seen -LRB- some hundreds of years ago -RRB- on the face of a freshman , glancing up from his book to find his doorway ominously filling with sophomores .
Parsing [sent. 1140 len. 19]: I stepped out to meet him , indignant upon several counts , most of all upon his own .
Parsing [sent. 1141 len. 66]: I knew there was no offence in his heart , not the remotest rude intent , but the fact was before me that he had frightened a woman , had given this very lovely guest of my friends good cause to hold him a boor , if she did not , indeed , think him -LRB- as she probably thought me -RRB- an outright lunatic !
Parsing [sent. 1142 len. 11]: I said : `` You spoke to that lady ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1143 len. 21]: And my voice sounded unexpectedly harsh and sharp to my own ears , for I had meant to speak quietly .
Parsing [sent. 1144 len. 7]: `` I know -- I know .
Parsing [sent. 1145 len. 10]: It -- it was wrong , '' he stammered .
Parsing [sent. 1146 len. 15]: `` I knew I should n't -- and I could n't help it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1147 len. 9]: `` You expect me to believe that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1148 len. 11]: `` It 's the truth ; I could n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1149 len. 20]: I laughed sceptically ; and he flinched , but repeated that what he had said was only the truth .
Parsing [sent. 1150 len. 17]: `` I do n't understand ; it was all beyond me , '' he added huskily .
Parsing [sent. 1151 len. 10]: `` What was it you said to her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1152 len. 12]: `` I spoke her name -- ` Madame d'Armand . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 1153 len. 8]: `` You said more than that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1154 len. 14]: `` I asked her if she would let me see her again . ''
Parsing [sent. 1155 len. 5]: `` What else ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1156 len. 8]: `` Nothing , '' he answered humbly .
Parsing [sent. 1157 len. 33]: `` And then she -- then for a moment it seemed -- for a moment she did n't seem to be able to speak -- '' `` I should think not ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1158 len. 12]: I shouted , and burst out at him with satirical laughter .
Parsing [sent. 1159 len. 66]: He stood patiently enduring it , his lowered eyes following the aimless movements of his hands , which were twisting and untwisting his flexible straw hat ; and it might have struck me as nearer akin to tragedy rather than to a thing for laughter : this spectacle of a grown man so like a schoolboy before the master , shamefaced over a stammered confession .
Parsing [sent. 1160 len. 14]: `` But she did say something to you , did n't she ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1161 len. 12]: I asked finally , with the gentleness of a cross-examining lawyer .
Parsing [sent. 1162 len. 8]: `` Yes -- after that moment . ''
Parsing [sent. 1163 len. 8]: `` Well , what was it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1164 len. 9]: `` She said , ` Not now ! '
Parsing [sent. 1165 len. 5]: That was all . ''
Parsing [sent. 1166 len. 11]: `` I suppose that was all she had breath for !
Parsing [sent. 1167 len. 15]: It was just the inconsequent and meaningless thing a frightened woman WOULD say ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1168 len. 4]: `` Meaningless ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1169 len. 8]: he repeated , and looked up wonderingly .
Parsing [sent. 1170 len. 10]: `` Did you take it for an appointment ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1171 len. 14]: I roared , quite out of patience , and losing my temper completely .
Parsing [sent. 1172 len. 7]: `` No , no , no !
Parsing [sent. 1173 len. 20]: She said only that , and then -- '' `` Then she turned and ran away from you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1174 len. 10]: `` Yes , '' he said , swallowing painfully .
Parsing [sent. 1175 len. 31]: `` That PLEASED you , '' I stormed , `` to frighten a woman in the woods -- to make her feel that she ca n't walk here in safety !
Parsing [sent. 1176 len. 8]: You ENJOY doing things like that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1177 len. 38]: He looked at me with disconcerting steadiness for a moment , and , without offering any other response , turned aside , resting his arm against the trunk of a tree and gazing into the quiet forest .
Parsing [sent. 1178 len. 41]: I set about packing my traps , grumbling various sarcasms , the last mutterings of a departed storm , for already I realised that I had taken out my own mortification upon him , and I was stricken with remorse .
Parsing [sent. 1179 len. 25]: And yet , so contrarily are we made , I continued to be unkind while in my heart I was asking pardon of him .
Parsing [sent. 1180 len. 36]: I tried to make my reproaches gentler , to lend my voice a hint of friendly humour , but in spite of me the one sounded gruffer and the other sourer with everything I said .
Parsing [sent. 1181 len. 37]: This was the worse because of the continued silence of the victim : he did not once answer , nor by the slightest movement alter his attitude until I had finished -- and more than finished .
Parsing [sent. 1182 len. 9]: `` There -- and that 's all ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1183 len. 18]: I said desperately , when the things were strapped and I had slung them to my shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 1184 len. 12]: `` Let 's be off , in heaven 's name ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1185 len. 23]: At that he turned quickly toward me ; it did not lessen my remorse to see that he had grown very pale .
Parsing [sent. 1186 len. 28]: `` I would n't have frightened her for the world , '' he said , and his voice and his whole body shook with a strange violence .
Parsing [sent. 1187 len. 15]: `` I would n't have frightened her to please the angels in heaven ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1188 len. 37]: A blunderer whose incantation had brought the spirit up to face me , I stared at him helplessly , nor could I find words to answer or control the passion that my imbecile scolding had evoked .
Parsing [sent. 1189 len. 17]: Whatever the barriers Keredec 's training had built for his protection , they were down now .
Parsing [sent. 1190 len. 9]: `` You think I told a lie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1191 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 1192 len. 17]: `` You think I lied when I said I could n't help speaking to her ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1193 len. 10]: `` No , no , '' I said earnestly .
Parsing [sent. 1194 len. 11]: `` I did n't mean -- '' `` Words ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1195 len. 13]: he swept the feeble protest away , drowned in a whirling vehemence .
Parsing [sent. 1196 len. 7]: `` And what does it matter ?
Parsing [sent. 1197 len. 5]: You CA N'T understand .
Parsing [sent. 1198 len. 28]: When YOU want to know what to do , you look back into your life and it tells you ; and I look back -- AH ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1199 len. 11]: He cried out , uttering a half-choked , incoherent syllable .
Parsing [sent. 1200 len. 11]: `` I look back and it 's all -- BLIND !
Parsing [sent. 1201 len. 17]: All these things you CAN do and CA N'T do -- all these infinite little things !
Parsing [sent. 1202 len. 27]: You know , and Keredec knows , and Glouglou knows , and every mortal soul on earth knows -- but _ I _ do n't know !
Parsing [sent. 1203 len. 16]: Your life has taught you , and you know , but I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 1204 len. 7]: I have n't HAD my life .
Parsing [sent. 1205 len. 4]: It 's gone !
Parsing [sent. 1206 len. 31]: All I have is words that Keredec has said to me , and it 's like a man with no eyes , out in the sunshine hunting for the light .
Parsing [sent. 1207 len. 21]: Do you think words can teach you to resist such impulses as I had when I spoke to Madame d'Armand ?
Parsing [sent. 1208 len. 9]: Can life itself teach you to resist them ?
Parsing [sent. 1209 len. 7]: Perhaps you never had them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1210 len. 11]: `` I do n't know , '' I answered honestly .
Parsing [sent. 1211 len. 83]: `` I would burn my hand from my arm and my arm from my body , '' he went on , with the same wild intensity , `` rather than trouble her or frighten her , but I could n't help speaking to her any more than I can help wanting to see her again -- the feeling that I MUST -- whatever you say or do , whatever Keredec says or does , whatever the whole world may say or do .
Parsing [sent. 1212 len. 4]: And I will !
Parsing [sent. 1213 len. 15]: It is n't a thing to choose to do , or not to do .
Parsing [sent. 1214 len. 15]: I ca n't help it any more than I can help being alive ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1215 len. 28]: He paused , wiping from his brow a heavy dew not of the heat , but like that on the forehead of a man in crucial pain .
Parsing [sent. 1216 len. 26]: I made nervous haste to seize the opportunity , and said gently , almost timidly : `` But if it should distress the lady ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1217 len. 9]: `` Yes -- then I could keep away .
Parsing [sent. 1218 len. 7]: But I must know that . ''
Parsing [sent. 1219 len. 22]: `` I think you might know it by her running away -- and by her look , '' I said mildly .
Parsing [sent. 1220 len. 6]: `` Did n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1221 len. 4]: `` NO ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1222 len. 8]: And his eyes flashed an added emphasis .
Parsing [sent. 1223 len. 31]: `` Well , well , '' I said , `` let 's be on our way , or the professor will be wondering if he is to dine alone . ''
Parsing [sent. 1224 len. 16]: Without looking to see if he followed , I struck into the path toward home .
Parsing [sent. 1225 len. 45]: He did follow , obediently enough , not uttering another word so long as we were in the woods , though I could hear him breathing sharply as he strode behind me , and knew that he was struggling to regain control of himself .
Parsing [sent. 1226 len. 38]: I set the pace , making it as fast as I could , and neither of us spoke again until we had come out of the forest and were upon the main road near the Baudry cottage .
Parsing [sent. 1227 len. 16]: Then he said in a steadier voice : `` Why should it distress her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1228 len. 35]: `` Well , you see , '' I began , not slackening the pace `` there are formalities -- '' `` Ah , I know , '' he interrupted , with an impatient laugh .
Parsing [sent. 1229 len. 26]: `` Keredec once took me to a marionette show -- all the little people strung on wires ; they could n't move any other way .
Parsing [sent. 1230 len. 23]: And so you must n't talk to a woman until somebody whose name has been spoken to you speaks yours to her !
Parsing [sent. 1231 len. 10]: Do you call that a rule of nature ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1232 len. 29]: `` My dear boy , '' I laughed in some desperation , `` we must conform to it , ordinarily , no matter whose rule it is . ''
Parsing [sent. 1233 len. 14]: `` Do you think Madame d'Armand cares for little forms like that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1234 len. 4]: he asked challengingly .
Parsing [sent. 1235 len. 12]: `` She does , '' I assured him with perfect confidence .
Parsing [sent. 1236 len. 18]: `` And , for the hundredth time , you must have seen how you troubled her . ''
Parsing [sent. 1237 len. 20]: `` No , '' he returned , with the same curious obstinacy , `` I do n't believe it .
Parsing [sent. 1238 len. 10]: There was something , but it was n't trouble .
Parsing [sent. 1239 len. 43]: We looked straight at each other ; I saw her eyes plainly , and it was -- '' he paused and sighed , a sudden , brilliant smile upon his lips -- `` it was very -- it was very strange ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1240 len. 30]: There was something so glad and different in his look that -- like any other dried-up old blunderer in my place -- I felt an instant tendency to laugh .
Parsing [sent. 1241 len. 31]: It was that heathenish possession , the old insanity of the risibles , which makes a man think it a humourous thing that his friend should be discovered in love .
Parsing [sent. 1242 len. 50]: But before I spoke , before I quite smiled outright , I was given the grace to see myself in the likeness of a leering stranger trespassing in some cherished inclosure : a garden where the gentlest guests must always be intruders , and only the owner should come .
Parsing [sent. 1243 len. 30]: The best of us profane it readily , leaving the coarse prints of our heels upon its paths , mauling and man-handling the fairy blossoms with what pudgy fingers !
Parsing [sent. 1244 len. 48]: Comes the poet , ruthlessly leaping the wall and trumpeting indecently his view - halloo of the chase , and , after him , the joker , snickering and hopeful of a kill among the rose-beds ; for this has been their hunting-ground since the world began .
Parsing [sent. 1245 len. 42]: These two have made us miserably ashamed of the divine infinitive , so that we are afraid to utter the very words `` to love , '' lest some urchin overhear and pursue us with a sticky forefinger and stickier taunts .
Parsing [sent. 1246 len. 35]: It is little to my credit that I checked the silly impulse to giggle at the eternal marvel , and went as gently as I could where I should not have gone at all .
Parsing [sent. 1247 len. 45]: `` But if you were wrong , '' I said , `` if it did distress her , and if it happened that she has already had too much that was distressing in her life -- '' `` You know something about her ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1248 len. 3]: he exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 1249 len. 16]: `` You know -- '' `` I do not , '' I interrupted in turn .
Parsing [sent. 1250 len. 15]: `` I have only a vague guess ; I may be altogether mistaken . ''
Parsing [sent. 1251 len. 9]: `` What is it that you guess ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1252 len. 4]: he demanded abruptly .
Parsing [sent. 1253 len. 7]: `` Who made her suffer ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1254 len. 42]: `` I think it was her husband , '' I said , with a lack of discretion for which I was instantly sorry , fearing with reason that I had added a final blunder to the long list of the afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 1255 len. 16]: `` That is , '' I added , `` if my guess is right . ''
Parsing [sent. 1256 len. 26]: He stopped short in the road , detaining me by the arm , the question coming like a whip-crack : sharp , loud , violent .
Parsing [sent. 1257 len. 6]: `` Is he alive ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1258 len. 28]: `` I do n't know , '' I answered , beginning to move forward ; `` and this is foolish talk -- especially on my part ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1259 len. 15]: `` But I want to know , '' he persisted , again detaining me .
Parsing [sent. 1260 len. 8]: `` And I DO N'T know ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1261 len. 4]: I returned emphatically .
Parsing [sent. 1262 len. 16]: `` Probably I am entirely mistaken in thinking that I know anything of her whatever .
Parsing [sent. 1263 len. 30]: I ought not to have spoken , unless I knew what I was talking about , and I 'd rather not say any more until I do know . ''
Parsing [sent. 1264 len. 9]: `` Very well , '' he said quickly .
Parsing [sent. 1265 len. 8]: `` Will you tell me then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1266 len. 13]: `` Yes -- if you will let it go at that . ''
Parsing [sent. 1267 len. 26]: `` Thank you , '' he said , and with an impulse which was but too plainly one of gratitude , offered me his hand .
Parsing [sent. 1268 len. 35]: I took it , and my soul was disquieted within me , for it was no purpose of mine to set inquiries on foot in regard to the affairs of `` Madame d'Armand . ''
Parsing [sent. 1269 len. 63]: It was early dusk , that hour , a little silvered but still clear , when the edges of things are beginning to grow indefinite , and usually our sleepy countryside knew no tranquiller time of day ; but to-night , as we approached the inn , there were strange shapes in the roadway and other tokens that events were stirring there .
Parsing [sent. 1270 len. 12]: From the courtyard came the sounds of laughter and chattering voices .
Parsing [sent. 1271 len. 64]: Before the entrance stood a couple of open touring-cars ; the chauffeurs engaged in cooling the rear tires with buckets of water brought by a personage ordinarily known as Glouglou , whose look and manner , as he performed this office for the leathern dignitaries , so awed me that I wondered I had ever dared address him with any presumption of intimacy .
Parsing [sent. 1272 len. 52]: The cars were great and opulent , of impressive wheel-base , and fore-and - aft they were laden intricately with baggage : concave trunks fitting behind the tonneaus , thin trunks fastened upon the footboards , green , circular trunks adjusted to the spare tires , all deeply coated with dust .
Parsing [sent. 1273 len. 42]: Here were fineries from Paris , doubtless on their way to flutter over the gay sands of Trouville , and now wandering but temporarily from the road ; for such splendours were never designed to dazzle us of Madame Brossard 's .
Parsing [sent. 1274 len. 35]: We were crossing before the machines when one of the drivers saw fit to crank his engine -LRB- if that is the knowing phrase -RRB- and the thing shook out the usual vibrating uproar .
Parsing [sent. 1275 len. 9]: It had a devastating effect upon my companion .
Parsing [sent. 1276 len. 16]: He uttered a wild exclamation and sprang sideways into me , almost upsetting us both .
Parsing [sent. 1277 len. 9]: `` What on earth is the matter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1278 len. 3]: I asked .
Parsing [sent. 1279 len. 10]: `` Did you think the car was starting ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1280 len. 19]: He turned toward me a face upon which was imprinted the sheer , blank terror of a child .
Parsing [sent. 1281 len. 11]: It passed in an instant however , and he laughed .
Parsing [sent. 1282 len. 7]: `` I really did n't know .
Parsing [sent. 1283 len. 38]: Everything has been so quiet always , out here in the country -- and that horrible racket coming so suddenly -- '' Laughing with him , I took his arm and we turned to enter the archway .
Parsing [sent. 1284 len. 26]: As we did so we almost ran into a tall man who was coming out , evidently intending to speak to one of the drivers .
Parsing [sent. 1285 len. 44]: The stranger stepped back with a word of apology , and I took note of him for a fellow-countryman , and a worldly buck of fashion indeed , almost as cap-a-pie the automobilist as my mysterious spiller of cider had been the pedestrian .
Parsing [sent. 1286 len. 61]: But this was no game-chicken ; on the contrary -LRB- so far as a glance in the dusk of the archway revealed him -RRB- , much the picture for framing in a club window of a Sunday morning ; a seasoned , hard-surfaced , knowing creature for whom many a head waiter must have swept previous claimants from desired tables .
Parsing [sent. 1287 len. 15]: He looked forty years so cannily that I guessed him to be about fifty .
Parsing [sent. 1288 len. 34]: We were passing him when he uttered an ejaculation of surprise and stepped forward again , holding out his hand to my companion , and exclaiming : `` Where did YOU come from ?
Parsing [sent. 1289 len. 8]: I 'd hardly have known you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1290 len. 24]: Oliver seemed unconscious of the proffered hand ; he stiffened visibly and said : `` I think there must be some mistake . ''
Parsing [sent. 1291 len. 11]: `` So there is , '' said the other promptly .
Parsing [sent. 1292 len. 9]: `` I have been misled by a resemblance .
Parsing [sent. 1293 len. 6]: I beg your pardon . ''
Parsing [sent. 1294 len. 33]: He lifted his cap slightly , going on , and we entered the courtyard to find a cheerful party of nine or ten men and women seated about a couple of tables .
Parsing [sent. 1295 len. 53]: Like the person we had just encountered , they all exhibited a picturesque elaboration of the costume permitted by their mode of travel ; making effective groupings in their ample draperies of buff and green and white , with glimpses of a flushed and pretty face or two among the loosened veilings .
Parsing [sent. 1296 len. 35]: Upon the tables were pots of tea , plates of sandwiches , Madame Brossard 's three best silver dishes heaped with fruit , and some bottles of dry champagne from the cellars of Rheims .
Parsing [sent. 1297 len. 44]: The partakers were making very merry , having with them -LRB- as is inevitable in all such parties , it seems -RRB- a fat young man inclined to humour , who was now upon his feet for the proposal of some prankish toast .
Parsing [sent. 1298 len. 32]: He interrupted himself long enough to glance our way as we crossed the garden ; and it struck me that several pairs of brighter eyes followed my young companion with interest .
Parsing [sent. 1299 len. 46]: He was well worth it , perhaps all the more because he was so genuinely unconscious of it ; and he ran up the gallery steps and disappeared into his own rooms without sending even a glance from the corner of his eye in return .
Parsing [sent. 1300 len. 23]: I went almost as quickly to my pavilion , and , without lighting my lamp , set about my preparations for dinner .
Parsing [sent. 1301 len. 59]: The party outside , breaking up presently , could be heard moving toward the archway with increased noise and laughter , inspired by some exquisite antic on the part of the fat young man , when a girl 's voice -LRB- a very attractive voice -RRB- called , `` Oh , Cressie , are n't you coming ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1302 len. 20]: and a man 's replied , from near my veranda : `` Only stopping to light a cigar . ''
Parsing [sent. 1303 len. 21]: A flutter of skirts and a patter of feet betokened that the girl came running back to join the smoker .
Parsing [sent. 1304 len. 21]: `` Cressie , '' I heard her say in an eager , lowered tone , `` who WAS he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1305 len. 6]: `` Who was who ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1306 len. 9]: `` That DEVASTATING creature in white flannels ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1307 len. 4]: The man chuckled .
Parsing [sent. 1308 len. 8]: `` Matinee sort of devastator -- what ?
Parsing [sent. 1309 len. 33]: Monte Cristo hair , noble profile -- '' `` You 'd better tell me , '' she interrupted earnestly -- `` if you do n't want me to ask the WAITER . ''
Parsing [sent. 1310 len. 9]: `` But I do n't know him . ''
Parsing [sent. 1311 len. 9]: `` I saw you speak to him . ''
Parsing [sent. 1312 len. 22]: `` I thought it was a man I met three years ago out in San Francisco , but I was mistaken .
Parsing [sent. 1313 len. 6]: There was a slight resemblance .
Parsing [sent. 1314 len. 16]: This fellow might have been a rather decent younger brother of the man I knew .
Parsing [sent. 1315 len. 68]: HE was the -- '' My strong impression was that if the speaker had not been interrupted at this point he would have said something very unfavourable to the character of the man he had met in San Francisco ; but there came a series of blasts from the automobile horns and loud calls from others of the party , who were evidently waiting for these two .
Parsing [sent. 1316 len. 4]: `` Coming ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1317 len. 4]: shouted the man .
Parsing [sent. 1318 len. 4]: `` Wait ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1319 len. 25]: said his companion hurriedly , `` Who was the other man , the older one with the painting things and SUCH a coat ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1320 len. 10]: `` Never saw him before in my life . ''
Parsing [sent. 1321 len. 14]: I caught a last word from the girl as the pair moved away .
Parsing [sent. 1322 len. 18]: `` I 'll come back here with a BAND to-morrow night , and serenade the beautiful one .
Parsing [sent. 1323 len. 14]: `` Perhaps he 'd drop me his card out of the window ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1324 len. 35]: The horns sounded again ; there was a final chorus of laughter , suddenly ceasing to be heard as the cars swept away , and Les Trois Pigeons was left to its accustomed quiet .
Parsing [sent. 1325 len. 19]: `` Monsieur is served , '' said Amedee , looking in at my door , five minutes later .
Parsing [sent. 1326 len. 13]: `` You have passed a great hour just now , Amedee . ''
Parsing [sent. 1327 len. 11]: `` It was like the old days , truly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1328 len. 11]: `` They are off for Trouville , I suppose . ''
Parsing [sent. 1329 len. 32]: `` No , monsieur , they are on their way to visit the chateau , and stopped here only because the run from Paris had made the tires too hot . ''
Parsing [sent. 1330 len. 9]: `` To visit Quesnay , you mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1331 len. 3]: `` Truly .
Parsing [sent. 1332 len. 20]: But monsieur need give himself no uneasiness ; I did not mention to any one that monsieur is here .
Parsing [sent. 1333 len. 6]: His name was not spoken .
Parsing [sent. 1334 len. 12]: Mademoiselle Ward returned to the chateau to-day , '' he added .
Parsing [sent. 1335 len. 8]: `` She has been in England . ''
Parsing [sent. 1336 len. 16]: `` Quesnay will be gay , '' I said , coming out to the table .
Parsing [sent. 1337 len. 37]: Oliver Saffren was helping the professor down the steps , and Keredec , bent with suffering , but indomitable , gave me a hearty greeting , and began a ruthless dissection of Plato with the soup .
Parsing [sent. 1338 len. 21]: Oliver , usually , very quiet , as I have said , seemed a little restless under the discourse to-night .
Parsing [sent. 1339 len. 17]: However , he did not interrupt , sitting patiently until bedtime , though obviously not listening .
Parsing [sent. 1340 len. 49]: When he bade me good night he gave me a look so clearly in reference to a secret understanding between us that , meaning to keep only the letter of my promise to him , I felt about as comfortable as if I had meanly tricked a child .
Parsing [sent. 1341 len. 45]: CHAPTER X I had finished dressing , next morning , and was strapping my things together for the day 's campaign , when I heard a shuffling step upon the porch , and the door opened gently , without any previous ceremony of knocking .
Parsing [sent. 1342 len. 67]: To my angle of vision what at first appeared to have opened it was a tray of coffee , rolls , eggs , and a packet of sandwiches , but , after hesitating somewhat , this apparition advanced farther into the room , disclosing a pair of supporting hands , followed in due time by the whole person of a nervously smiling and visibly apprehensive Amedee .
Parsing [sent. 1343 len. 66]: He closed the door behind him by the simple action of backing against it , took the cloth from his arm , and with a single gesture spread it neatly upon a small table , then , turning to me , laid the forefinger of his right hand warningly upon his lips and bowed me a deferential invitation to occupy the chair beside the table .
Parsing [sent. 1344 len. 17]: `` Well , '' I said , glaring at him , `` what ails you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1345 len. 21]: `` I thought monsieur might prefer his breakfast indoors , this morning , '' he returned in a low voice .
Parsing [sent. 1346 len. 6]: `` Why should I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1347 len. 29]: The miserable old man said something I did not understand -- an incoherent syllable or two -- suddenly covered his mouth with both hands , and turned away .
Parsing [sent. 1348 len. 44]: I heard a catch in his throat ; suffocated sounds issued from his bosom ; however , it was nothing more than a momentary seizure , and , recovering command of himself by a powerful effort , he faced me with hypocritical servility .
Parsing [sent. 1349 len. 7]: `` Why do you laugh ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1350 len. 4]: I asked indignantly .
Parsing [sent. 1351 len. 15]: `` But I did not laugh , '' he replied in a husky whisper .
Parsing [sent. 1352 len. 6]: `` Not at all . ''
Parsing [sent. 1353 len. 12]: `` You did , '' I asserted , raising my voice .
Parsing [sent. 1354 len. 7]: `` It almost killed you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1355 len. 12]: `` Monsieur , '' he begged hoarsely , `` HUSH ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1356 len. 7]: `` What is the matter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1357 len. 4]: I demanded loudly .
Parsing [sent. 1358 len. 10]: `` What do you mean by these abominable croakings ?
Parsing [sent. 1359 len. 4]: Speak out ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1360 len. 14]: `` Monsieur -- '' he gesticulated in a panic , toward the courtyard .
Parsing [sent. 1361 len. 8]: `` Mademoiselle Ward is out there . ''
Parsing [sent. 1362 len. 4]: `` WHAT ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1363 len. 8]: But I did not shout the word .
Parsing [sent. 1364 len. 28]: `` There is always a little window in the rear wall , '' he breathed in my ear as I dropped into the chair by the table .
Parsing [sent. 1365 len. 72]: `` She would not see you if -- '' I interrupted with all the French rough-and-ready expressions of dislike at my command , daring to hope that they might give him some shadowy , far-away idea of what I thought of both himself and his suggestions , and , notwithstanding the difficulty of expressing strong feeling in whispers , it seemed to me that , in a measure , I succeeded .
Parsing [sent. 1366 len. 23]: `` I am not in the habit of crawling out of ventilators , '' I added , subduing a tendency to vehemence .
Parsing [sent. 1367 len. 15]: `` And probably Mademoiselle Ward has only come to talk with Madame Brossard . ''
Parsing [sent. 1368 len. 20]: `` I fear some of those people may have told her you were here , '' he ventured insinuatingly .
Parsing [sent. 1369 len. 5]: `` What people ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1370 len. 24]: I asked , drinking my coffee calmly , yet , it must be confessed , without quite the deliberation I could have wished .
Parsing [sent. 1371 len. 13]: `` Those who stopped yesterday evening on the way to the chateau .
Parsing [sent. 1372 len. 9]: They might have recognised -- '' `` Impossible .
Parsing [sent. 1373 len. 7]: I knew none of them . ''
Parsing [sent. 1374 len. 10]: `` But Mademoiselle Ward knows that you are here .
Parsing [sent. 1375 len. 4]: Without doubt . ''
Parsing [sent. 1376 len. 8]: `` Why do you say so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1377 len. 9]: `` Because she has inquired for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1378 len. 4]: `` So ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1379 len. 10]: I rose at once and went toward the door .
Parsing [sent. 1380 len. 11]: `` Why did n't you tell me at once ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1381 len. 22]: `` But surely , '' he remonstrated , ignoring my question , `` monsieur will make some change of attire ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1382 len. 6]: `` Change of attire ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1383 len. 3]: I echoed .
Parsing [sent. 1384 len. 18]: `` Eh , the poor old coat all hunched at the shoulders and spotted with paint ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1385 len. 8]: `` Why should n't it be ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1386 len. 6]: I hissed , thoroughly irritated .
Parsing [sent. 1387 len. 11]: `` Do you take me for a racing marquis ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1388 len. 15]: `` But monsieur has a coat much more as a coat ought to be .
Parsing [sent. 1389 len. 17]: And Jean Ferret says -- '' `` Ha , now we 're getting at it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1390 len. 10]: said I. `` What does Jean Ferret say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1391 len. 18]: `` Perhaps it would be better if I did not repeat -- '' `` Out with it !
Parsing [sent. 1392 len. 7]: What does Jean Ferret say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1393 len. 42]: `` Well , then , Mademoiselle Ward 's maid from Paris has told Jean Ferret that monsieur and Mademoiselle Ward have corresponded for years , and that -- and that -- '' `` Go on , '' I bade him ominously .
Parsing [sent. 1394 len. 18]: `` That monsieur has sent Mademoiselle Ward many expensive jewels , and -- '' `` Aha ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1395 len. 15]: said I , at which he paused abruptly , and stood staring at me .
Parsing [sent. 1396 len. 33]: The idea of explaining Miss Elizabeth 's collection to him , of getting anything whatever through that complacent head of his , was so hopeless that I did not even consider it .
Parsing [sent. 1397 len. 35]: There was only one thing to do , and perhaps I should have done it -- I do not know , for he saw the menace coiling in my eye , and hurriedly retreated .
Parsing [sent. 1398 len. 4]: `` Monsieur ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1399 len. 41]: he gasped , backing away from me , and as his hand , fumbling behind him , found the latch of the door , he opened it , and scrambled out by a sort of spiral movement round the casing .
Parsing [sent. 1400 len. 29]: When I followed , a moment later -- with my traps on my shoulder and the packet of sandwiches in my pocket -- he was out of sight .
Parsing [sent. 1401 len. 49]: Miss Elizabeth sat beneath the arbour at the other end of the courtyard , and beside her stood the trim and glossy bay saddle-horse that she had ridden from Quesnay , his head outstretched above his mistress to paddle at the vine leaves with a tremulous upper lip .
Parsing [sent. 1402 len. 30]: She checked his desire with a slight movement of her hand upon the bridle-rein ; and he arched his neck prettily , pawing the gravel with a neat forefoot .
Parsing [sent. 1403 len. 55]: Miss Elizabeth is one of the few large women I have known to whom a riding - habit is entirely becoming , and this group of two -- a handsome woman and her handsome horse -- has had a charm for all men ever since horses were tamed and women began to be beautiful .
Parsing [sent. 1404 len. 26]: I thought of my work , of the canvases I meant to cover , but I felt the charm -- and I felt it stirringly .
Parsing [sent. 1405 len. 14]: It was a fine , fresh morning , and the sun just risen .
Parsing [sent. 1406 len. 59]: An expression in the lady 's attitude , and air which I instinctively construed as histrionic , seemed intended to convey that she had been kept waiting , yet had waited without reproach ; and although she must have heard me coming , she did not look toward me until I was quite near and spoke her name .
Parsing [sent. 1407 len. 16]: At that she sprang up quickly enough , and stretched out her hand to me .
Parsing [sent. 1408 len. 6]: `` Run to earth ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1409 len. 10]: she cried , advancing a step to meet me .
Parsing [sent. 1410 len. 23]: `` A pretty poor trophy of the chase , '' said I , `` but proud that you are its killer . ''
Parsing [sent. 1411 len. 23]: To my surprise and mystification , her cheeks and brow flushed rosily ; she was obviously conscious of it , and laughed .
Parsing [sent. 1412 len. 10]: `` Do n't be embarrassed , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 1413 len. 4]: `` I ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1414 len. 8]: `` Yes , you , poor man !
Parsing [sent. 1415 len. 11]: I suppose I could n't have more thoroughly compromised you .
Parsing [sent. 1416 len. 11]: Madame Brossard will never believe in your respectability again . ''
Parsing [sent. 1417 len. 14]: `` Oh , yes , she will , '' said I. `` What ?
Parsing [sent. 1418 len. 15]: A lodger who has ladies calling upon him at five o'clock in the morning ?
Parsing [sent. 1419 len. 47]: But your bundle 's on your shoulder , '' she rattled on , laughing , `` though there 's many could be bolder , and perhaps you 'll let me walk a bit of the way with you , if you 're for the road . ''
Parsing [sent. 1420 len. 9]: `` Perhaps I will , '' said I .
Parsing [sent. 1421 len. 41]: She caught up her riding-skirt , fastening it by a clasp at her side , and we passed out through the archway and went slowly along the road bordering the forest , her horse following obediently at half-rein 's length .
Parsing [sent. 1422 len. 14]: `` When did you hear that I was at Madame Brossard 's ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1423 len. 3]: I asked .
Parsing [sent. 1424 len. 14]: `` Ten minutes after I returned to Quesnay , late yesterday afternoon . ''
Parsing [sent. 1425 len. 6]: `` Who told you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1426 len. 4]: `` Louise . ''
Parsing [sent. 1427 len. 6]: I repeated the name questioningly .
Parsing [sent. 1428 len. 8]: `` You mean Mrs. Larrabee Harman ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1429 len. 8]: `` Louise Harman , '' she corrected .
Parsing [sent. 1430 len. 12]: `` Did n't you know she was staying at Quesnay ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1431 len. 13]: `` I guessed it , though Amedee got the name confused . ''
Parsing [sent. 1432 len. 20]: `` Yes , she 's been kind enough to look after the place for us while we were away .
Parsing [sent. 1433 len. 22]: George wo n't be back for another ten days , and I 've been overseeing an exhibition for him in London .
Parsing [sent. 1434 len. 28]: Afterward I did a round of visits -- tiresome enough , but among people it 's well to keep in touch with on George 's account . ''
Parsing [sent. 1435 len. 16]: `` I see , '' I said , with a grimness which probably escaped her .
Parsing [sent. 1436 len. 16]: `` But how did Mrs. Harman know that I was at Les Trois Pigeons ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1437 len. 17]: `` She met you once in the forest -- '' `` Twice , '' I interrupted .
Parsing [sent. 1438 len. 6]: `` She mentioned only once .
Parsing [sent. 1439 len. 15]: Of course she 'd often heard both George and me speak of you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1440 len. 16]: `` But how did she know it was I and where I was staying ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1441 len. 6]: `` Oh , that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1442 len. 7]: Her smile changed to a laugh .
Parsing [sent. 1443 len. 20]: `` Your maitre d'hotel told Ferret , a gardener at Quesnay , that you were at the inn . ''
Parsing [sent. 1444 len. 5]: `` He did ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1445 len. 20]: `` Oh , but you must n't be angry with him ; he made it quite all right . ''
Parsing [sent. 1446 len. 8]: `` How did he do that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1447 len. 27]: I asked , trying to speak calmly , though there was that in my mind which might have blanched the parchment cheek of a grand inquisitor .
Parsing [sent. 1448 len. 26]: `` He told Ferret that you were very anxious not to have it known -- '' `` You call that making it all right ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1449 len. 7]: `` For himself , I mean .
Parsing [sent. 1450 len. 14]: He asked Ferret not to mention who it was that told him . ''
Parsing [sent. 1451 len. 5]: `` The rascal ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1452 len. 3]: I cried .
Parsing [sent. 1453 len. 37]: `` The treacherous , brazen -- '' `` Unfortunate man , '' said Miss Elizabeth , `` do n't you see how clear you 're making it that you really meant to hide from us ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1454 len. 16]: There seemed to be something in that , and my tirade broke up in confusion .
Parsing [sent. 1455 len. 23]: `` Oh , no , '' I said lamely , `` I hoped -- I hoped -- '' `` Be careful ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1456 len. 14]: `` No ; I hoped to work down here , '' I blurted .
Parsing [sent. 1457 len. 17]: `` And I thought if I saw too much of you -- I might not . ''
Parsing [sent. 1458 len. 8]: She looked at me with widening eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1459 len. 24]: `` And I can take my choice , '' she cried , `` of all the different things you may mean by that !
Parsing [sent. 1460 len. 17]: It 's either the most outrageous speech I ever heard -- or the most flattering . ''
Parsing [sent. 1461 len. 11]: `` But I meant simply -- '' `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 1462 len. 8]: She lifted her hand and stopped me .
Parsing [sent. 1463 len. 21]: `` I 'd rather believe that I have at least the choice -- and let it go at that . ''
Parsing [sent. 1464 len. 34]: And as I began to laugh , she turned to me with a gravity apparently so genuine that for the moment I was fatuous enough to believe that she had said it seriously .
Parsing [sent. 1465 len. 17]: Ensued a pause of some duration , which , for my part , I found disturbing .
Parsing [sent. 1466 len. 9]: She broke it with a change of subject .
Parsing [sent. 1467 len. 15]: `` You think Louise very lovely to look at , do n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1468 len. 7]: `` Exquisite , '' I answered .
Parsing [sent. 1469 len. 6]: `` Every one does . ''
Parsing [sent. 1470 len. 34]: `` I suppose she told you -- '' and now I felt myself growing red -- `` that I behaved like a drunken acrobat when she came upon me in the path . ''
Parsing [sent. 1471 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 1472 len. 4]: Did you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1473 len. 40]: cried Miss Elizabeth , with a ready credulity which I thought by no means pretty ; indeed , she seemed amused and , to my surprise -LRB- for she is not an unkind woman -RRB- , rather heartlessly pleased .
Parsing [sent. 1474 len. 29]: `` Louise only said she knew it must be you , and that she wished she could have had a better look at what you were painting . ''
Parsing [sent. 1475 len. 6]: `` Heaven bless her ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1476 len. 3]: I exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 1477 len. 7]: `` Her reticence was angelic . ''
Parsing [sent. 1478 len. 26]: `` Yes , she has reticence , '' said my companion , with enough of the same quality to make me look at her quickly .
Parsing [sent. 1479 len. 10]: A thin line had been drawn across her forehead .
Parsing [sent. 1480 len. 11]: `` You mean she 's still reticent with George ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1481 len. 3]: I ventured .
Parsing [sent. 1482 len. 8]: `` Yes , '' she answered sadly .
Parsing [sent. 1483 len. 29]: `` Poor George always hopes , of course , in the silent way of his kind when they suffer from such unfortunate passions -- and he waits . ''
Parsing [sent. 1484 len. 11]: `` I suppose that former husband of hers recovered ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1485 len. 9]: `` I believe he 's still alive somewhere .
Parsing [sent. 1486 len. 7]: Locked up , I hope ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1487 len. 4]: she finished crisply .
Parsing [sent. 1488 len. 10]: `` She retained his name , '' I observed .
Parsing [sent. 1489 len. 3]: `` Harman ?
Parsing [sent. 1490 len. 13]: Yes , she retained it , '' said my companion rather shortly .
Parsing [sent. 1491 len. 16]: `` At all events , she 's rid of him , is n't she ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1492 len. 10]: `` Oh , she 's RID of him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1493 len. 10]: Her tone implied an enigmatic reservation of some kind .
Parsing [sent. 1494 len. 24]: `` It 's hard , '' I reflected aloud , `` hard to understand her making that mistake , young as she was .
Parsing [sent. 1495 len. 43]: Even in the glimpses of her I 've had , it was easy to see something of what she 's like : a fine , rare , high type -- '' `` But you did n't know HIM , did you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1496 len. 7]: Miss Elizabeth asked with some dryness .
Parsing [sent. 1497 len. 7]: `` No , '' I answered .
Parsing [sent. 1498 len. 29]: `` I saw him twice ; once at the time of his accident -- that was only a nightmare , his face covered with -- '' I shivered .
Parsing [sent. 1499 len. 35]: `` But I had caught a glimpse of him on the boulevard , and of all the dreadful -- '' `` Oh , but he was n't always dreadful , '' she interposed quickly .
Parsing [sent. 1500 len. 29]: `` He was a fascinating sort of person , quite charming and good-looking , when she ran away with him , though he was horribly dissipated even then .
Parsing [sent. 1501 len. 6]: He always had been THAT .
Parsing [sent. 1502 len. 16]: Of course she thought she 'd be able to straighten him out -- poor girl !
Parsing [sent. 1503 len. 16]: She tried , for three years -- three years it hurts one to think of !
Parsing [sent. 1504 len. 25]: You see it must have been something very like a ` grand passion ' to hold her through a pain three years long . ''
Parsing [sent. 1505 len. 22]: `` Or tremendous pride , '' said I. `` Women make an odd world of it for the rest of us .
Parsing [sent. 1506 len. 24]: There was good old George , as true and straight a man as ever lived -- '' `` And she took the other !
Parsing [sent. 1507 len. 3]: Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1508 len. 6]: George 's sister laughed sorrowfully .
Parsing [sent. 1509 len. 18]: `` But George and she have both survived the mistake , '' I went on with confidence .
Parsing [sent. 1510 len. 11]: `` Her tragedy must have taught her some important differences .
Parsing [sent. 1511 len. 21]: Have n't you a notion she 'll be tremendously glad to see him when he comes back from America ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1512 len. 9]: `` Ah , I do hope so ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1513 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 1514 len. 22]: `` You see , I 'm fearing that he hopes so too -- to the degree of counting on it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1515 len. 10]: `` You do n't count on it yourself ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1516 len. 5]: She shook her head .
Parsing [sent. 1517 len. 9]: `` With any other woman I should . ''
Parsing [sent. 1518 len. 8]: `` Why not with Mrs. Harman ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1519 len. 45]: `` Cousin Louise has her ways , '' said Miss Elizabeth slowly , and , whether she could not further explain her doubts , or whether she would not , that was all I got out of her on the subject at the time .
Parsing [sent. 1520 len. 27]: I asked one or two more questions , but my companion merely shook her head again , alluding vaguely to her cousin 's `` ways . ''
Parsing [sent. 1521 len. 22]: Then she brightened suddenly , and inquired when I would have my things sent up to the chateau from the inn .
Parsing [sent. 1522 len. 46]: At the risk of a misunderstanding which I felt I could ill afford , I resisted her kind hospitality , and the outcome of it was that there should be a kind of armistice , to begin with my dining at the chateau that evening .
Parsing [sent. 1523 len. 28]: Thereupon she mounted to the saddle , a bit of gymnastics for which she declined my assistance , and looked down upon me from a great height .
Parsing [sent. 1524 len. 25]: `` Did anybody ever tell you , '' was her surprising inquiry , `` that you are the queerest man of these times ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1525 len. 7]: `` No , '' I answered .
Parsing [sent. 1526 len. 12]: `` Do n't you think you 're a queerer woman ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1527 len. 4]: `` FOOTLE ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1528 len. 4]: she cried scornfully .
Parsing [sent. 1529 len. 11]: `` Be off to your woods and your woodscaping ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1530 len. 49]: The bay horse departed at a smart gait , not , I was glad to see , a parkish trot -- Miss Elizabeth wisely set limits to her sacrifices to Mode -- and she was far down the road before I had passed the outer fringe of trees .
Parsing [sent. 1531 len. 30]: My work was accomplished after a fashion more or less desultory that day ; I had many absent moments , was restless , and walked more than I painted .
Parsing [sent. 1532 len. 28]: Oliver Saffron did not join me in the late afternoon ; nor did the echo of distant yodelling bespeak any effort on his part to find me .
Parsing [sent. 1533 len. 15]: So I gave him up , and returned to the inn earlier than usual .
Parsing [sent. 1534 len. 36]: While dressing I sent word to Professor Keredec that I should not be able to join him at dinner that evening ; and it is to be recorded that Glouglou carried the message for me .
Parsing [sent. 1535 len. 21]: Amedee did not appear , from which it may be inferred that our maitre d'hotel was subject to lucid intervals .
Parsing [sent. 1536 len. 12]: Certainly his present shyness indicated an intelligence of no low order .
Parsing [sent. 1537 len. 23]: CHAPTER XI The dining-room at Quesnay is a pretty work of the second of those three Louises who made so much furniture .
Parsing [sent. 1538 len. 62]: It was never a proper setting for a rusty , out-of-doors painter-man , nor has such a fellow ever found himself complacently at ease there since the day its first banquet was spread for a score or so of fine-feathered epigram jinglers , fiddling Versailles gossip out of a rouge-and-lace Quesnay marquise newly sent into half-earnest banishment for too much king-hunting .
Parsing [sent. 1539 len. 37]: For my part , however , I should have preferred a chance at making a place for myself among the wigs and brocades to the Crusoe 's Isle of my chair at Miss Elizabeth 's table .
Parsing [sent. 1540 len. 32]: I learned at an early age to look my vanities in the face ; I outfaced them and they quailed , but persisted , surviving for my discomfort to this day .
Parsing [sent. 1541 len. 48]: Here is the confession : It was not until my arrival at the chateau that I realised what temerity it involved to dine there in evening clothes purchased , some four or five or six years previously , in the economical neighbourhood of the Boulevard St. Michel .
Parsing [sent. 1542 len. 35]: Yet the things fitted me well enough ; were clean and not shiny , having been worn no more than a dozen times , I think ; though they might have been better pressed .
Parsing [sent. 1543 len. 84]: Looking over the men of the Quesnay party -- or perhaps I should signify a reversal of that and say a glance of theirs at me -- revealed the importance of a particular length of coat-tail , of a certain rich effect obtained by widely separating the lower points of the waistcoat , of the display of some imagination in the buttons upon the same garment , of a doubled-back arrangement of cuffs , and of a specific design and dimension of tie .
Parsing [sent. 1544 len. 33]: Marked uniformity in these matters denoted their necessity ; and clothes differing from the essential so vitally as did mine must have seemed immodest , little better than no clothes at all .
Parsing [sent. 1545 len. 25]: I doubt if I could have argued in extenuation my lack of advantages for study , such an excuse being itself the damning circumstance .
Parsing [sent. 1546 len. 18]: Of course eccentricity is permitted , but -LRB- as in the Arts -RRB- only to the established .
Parsing [sent. 1547 len. 54]: And I recall a painful change of colour which befell the countenance of a shining young man I met at Ward 's house in Paris : he had used his handkerchief and was absently putting it in his pocket when he providentially noticed what he was doing and restored it to his sleeve .
Parsing [sent. 1548 len. 31]: Miss Elizabeth had the courage to take me under her wing , placing me upon her left at dinner ; but sprightlier calls than mine demanded and occupied her attention .
Parsing [sent. 1549 len. 45]: At my other side sat a magnificently upholstered lady , who offered a fine shoulder and the rear wall of a collar of pearls for my observation throughout the evening , as she leaned forward talking eagerly with a male personage across the table .
Parsing [sent. 1550 len. 33]: This was a prince , ending in `` ski '' : he permitted himself the slight vagary of wearing a gold bracelet , and perhaps this flavour of romance drew the lady .
Parsing [sent. 1551 len. 17]: Had my good fortune ever granted a second meeting , I should not have known her .
Parsing [sent. 1552 len. 40]: Fragments reaching me in my seclusion indicated that the various conversations up and down the long table were animated ; and at times some topic proved of such high interest as to engage the comment of the whole company .
Parsing [sent. 1553 len. 70]: This was the case when the age of one of the English king 's grandchildren came in question , but a subject which called for even longer -LRB- if less spirited -RRB- discourse concerned the shameful lack of standard on the part of citizens of the United States , or , as it was put , with no little exasperation , `` What is the trouble with America ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1554 len. 31]: Hereupon brightly gleamed the fat young man whom I had marked for a wit at Les Trois Pigeons ; he pictured with inimitable mimicry a western senator lately in France .
Parsing [sent. 1555 len. 28]: This outcast , it appeared , had worn a slouch hat at a garden party and had otherwise betrayed his country to the ridicule of the intelligent .
Parsing [sent. 1556 len. 32]: `` But really , '' said the fat young man , turning plaintiff in conclusion , `` imagine what such things make the English and the French think of US ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1557 len. 18]: And it finally went by consent that the trouble with America was the vulgarity of our tourists .
Parsing [sent. 1558 len. 6]: `` A dreadful lot ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1559 len. 9]: Miss Elizabeth cheerfully summed up for them all .
Parsing [sent. 1560 len. 20]: `` The miseries I undergo with that class of ` prominent Amurricans ' who bring letters to my brother !
Parsing [sent. 1561 len. 36]: I remember one awful creature who said , when I came into the room , ` Well , ma'am , I guess you 're the lady of the house , are n't you ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 1562 len. 34]: Miss Elizabeth sparkled through the chorus of laughter , but I remembered the `` awful creature , '' a genial and wise old man of affairs , whose daughter 's portrait George painted .
Parsing [sent. 1563 len. 32]: Miss Elizabeth had missed his point : the canvasser 's phrase had been intended with humour , and even had it lacked that , it was not without a pretty quaintness .
Parsing [sent. 1564 len. 46]: So I thought , being `` left to my own reflections , '' which may have partaken of my own special kind of snobbery ; at least I regretted the Elizabeth of the morning garden and the early walk along the fringe of the woods .
Parsing [sent. 1565 len. 10]: For she at my side to-night was another lady .
Parsing [sent. 1566 len. 18]: The banquet was drawing to a close when she leaned toward me and spoke in an undertone .
Parsing [sent. 1567 len. 50]: As this was the first sign , in so protracted a period , that I might ever again establish relations with the world of men , it came upon me like a Friday 's footprint , and in the moment of shock I did not catch what she said .
Parsing [sent. 1568 len. 30]: `` Anne Elliott , yonder , is asking you a question , '' she repeated , nodding at a very pretty gal down and across the table from me .
Parsing [sent. 1569 len. 26]: Miss Anne Elliott 's attractive voice had previously enabled me to recognise her as the young woman who had threatened to serenade Les Trois Pigeons .
Parsing [sent. 1570 len. 36]: `` I beg your pardon , '' I said , addressing her , and at the sound my obscurity was illuminated , about half of the company turning to look at me with wide-eyed surprise .
Parsing [sent. 1571 len. 25]: -LRB- I spoke in an ordinary tone , it may need to be explained , and there is nothing remarkable about my voice -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 1572 len. 15]: `` I hear you 're at Les Trois Pigeons , '' said Miss Elliott .
Parsing [sent. 1573 len. 4]: `` Yes ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1574 len. 13]: `` WOULD you mind telling us something of the MYSTERIOUS Narcissus ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1575 len. 19]: `` If you 'll be more definite , '' I returned , in the tone of a question .
Parsing [sent. 1576 len. 28]: `` There could n't be more than one like THAT , '' said Miss Elliott , `` at least , not in one neighbourhood , could there ?
Parsing [sent. 1577 len. 18]: I mean a RECKLESSLY charming vision with a WHITE tie and WHITE hair and WHITE flannels . ''
Parsing [sent. 1578 len. 14]: `` Oh , '' said I , `` HE 'S not mysterious . ''
Parsing [sent. 1579 len. 17]: `` But he IS , '' she returned ; `` I insist on his being MYSTERIOUS !
Parsing [sent. 1580 len. 7]: Rarely , grandly , STRANGELY mysterious !
Parsing [sent. 1581 len. 8]: You WILL let me think so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1582 len. 44]: This young lady had a whimsical manner of emphasising words unexpectedly , with a breathless intensity that approached violence , a habit dangerously contagious among nervous persons , so that I answered slowly , out of a fear that I might echo it .
Parsing [sent. 1583 len. 10]: `` It would need a great deal of imagination .
Parsing [sent. 1584 len. 20]: He 's a young American , very attractive , very simple -- '' `` But he 's MAD ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1585 len. 3]: she interrupted .
Parsing [sent. 1586 len. 6]: `` Oh , no ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1587 len. 4]: I said hastily .
Parsing [sent. 1588 len. 5]: `` But he IS !
Parsing [sent. 1589 len. 33]: A person told me so in a garden this VERY afternoon , '' she went on eagerly ; `` a person with a rake and EVER so many moles on his chin .
Parsing [sent. 1590 len. 8]: This person told me all about him .
Parsing [sent. 1591 len. 24]: His name is Oliver Saffren , and he 's in the charge of a VERY large doctor and quite , QUITE mad ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1592 len. 8]: `` Jean Ferret , the gardener . ''
Parsing [sent. 1593 len. 40]: I said deliberately , and with venom , `` is fast acquiring notoriety in these parts as an idiot of purest ray , and he had his information from another whose continuance unhanged is every hour more miraculous . ''
Parsing [sent. 1594 len. 34]: `` How RUTHLESS of you , '' cried Miss Elliott , with exaggerated reproach , `` when I have had such a thrilling happiness all day in believing that RIOTOUSLY beautiful creature mad !
Parsing [sent. 1595 len. 9]: You are wholly positive he is n't ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1596 len. 14]: Our dialogue was now all that delayed a general departure from the table .
Parsing [sent. 1597 len. 45]: This , combined with the naive surprise I have mentioned , served to make us temporarily the centre of attention , and , among the faces turned toward me , my glance fell unexpectedly upon one I had not seen since entering the dining-room .
Parsing [sent. 1598 len. 47]: Mrs. Harman had been placed at some distance from me and on the same side of the table , but now she leaned far back in her chair to look at me , so that I saw her behind the shoulders of the people between us .
Parsing [sent. 1599 len. 36]: She was watching me with an expression unmistakably of repressed anxiety and excitement , and as our eyes met , hers shone with a certain agitation , as of some odd consciousness shared with me .
Parsing [sent. 1600 len. 61]: It was so strangely , suddenly a reminder of the look of secret understanding given me with good night , twenty - four hours earlier , by the man whose sanity was Miss Elliott 's topic , that , puzzled and almost disconcerted for the moment , I did not at once reply to the lively young lady 's question .
Parsing [sent. 1601 len. 6]: `` You 're hesitating ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1602 len. 7]: she cried , clasping her hands .
Parsing [sent. 1603 len. 15]: `` I believe there 's a DARLING little chance of it , after all !
Parsing [sent. 1604 len. 26]: And if it were n't so , why would he need to be watched over , day AND night , by an ENORMOUS doctor ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1605 len. 6]: `` This IS romance ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1606 len. 3]: I retorted .
Parsing [sent. 1607 len. 33]: `` The doctor is Professor Keredec , illustriously known in this country , but not as a physician , and they are following some form of scientific research together , I believe .
Parsing [sent. 1608 len. 55]: But , assuming to speak as Mr. Saffren 's friend , '' I added , rising with the others upon Miss Ward 's example , `` I 'm sure if he could come to know of your interest , he would much rather play Hamlet for you than let you find him disappointing . ''
Parsing [sent. 1609 len. 12]: `` If he could come to know of my interest ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1610 len. 11]: she echoed , glancing down at herself with mock demureness .
Parsing [sent. 1611 len. 18]: `` Do n't you think he could come to know something more of me than that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1612 len. 13]: The windows had been thrown open , allowing passage to a veranda .
Parsing [sent. 1613 len. 60]: Miss Elizabeth led the way outdoors with the prince , the rest of us following at hazard , and in the mild confusion of this withdrawal I caught a final glimpse of Mrs. Harman , which revealed that she was still looking at me with the same tensity ; but with the movement of intervening groups I lost her .
Parsing [sent. 1614 len. 29]: Miss Elliott pointedly waited for me until I came round the table , attached me definitely by taking my arm , accompanying her action with a dazzling smile .
Parsing [sent. 1615 len. 12]: `` Oh , DO you think you can manage it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1616 len. 33]: she whispered rapturously , to which I replied -- as vaguely as I could -- that the demands of scientific research upon the time of its followers were apt to be exorbitant .
Parsing [sent. 1617 len. 20]: Tables and coffee were waiting on the broad terrace below , with a big moon rising in the sky .
Parsing [sent. 1618 len. 40]: I descended the steps in charge of this pretty cavalier , allowed her to seat me at the most remote of the tables , and accepted without unwillingness other gallantries of hers in the matter of coffee and cigarettes .
Parsing [sent. 1619 len. 36]: `` And now , '' she said , `` now that I 've done so much for your DEAREST hopes and comfort , look up at the milky moon , and tell me ALL ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1620 len. 8]: `` If you can bear it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1621 len. 32]: She leaned an elbow on the marble railing that protected the terrace , and , shielding her eyes from the moonlight with her hand , affected to gaze at me dramatically .
Parsing [sent. 1622 len. 10]: `` Have no distrust , '' she bade me .
Parsing [sent. 1623 len. 10]: `` Who and WHAT is the glorious stranger ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1624 len. 36]: Resisting an impulse to chime in with her humour , I gave her so dry and commonplace an account of my young friend at the inn that I presently found myself abandoned to solitude again .
Parsing [sent. 1625 len. 16]: `` I do n't know where to go , '' she complained as she rose .
Parsing [sent. 1626 len. 49]: `` These other people are MOST painful to a girl of my intelligence , but I can not linger by your side ; untruth long ago lost its interest for me , and I prefer to believe Mr. Jean Ferret -- if that is the gentleman 's name .
Parsing [sent. 1627 len. 16]: I 'd join Miss Ward and Cressie Ingle yonder , but Cressie WOULD be indignant !
Parsing [sent. 1628 len. 9]: I shall soothe my hurt with SWEETEST airs .
Parsing [sent. 1629 len. 3]: Adieu . ''
Parsing [sent. 1630 len. 46]: With that she made me a solemn courtesy and departed , a pretty little figure , not little in attractiveness , the strong moonlight , tinged with blue , shimmering over her blond hair and splashing brightly among the ripples of her silks and laces .
Parsing [sent. 1631 len. 33]: She swept across the terrace languidly , offering an effect of comedy not unfairylike , and , ascending the steps of the veranda , disappeared into the orange candle-light of a salon .
Parsing [sent. 1632 len. 36]: A moment later some chords were sounded firmly upon a piano in that room , and a bitter song swam out to me over the laughter and talk of the people at the other tables .
Parsing [sent. 1633 len. 34]: It was to be observed that Miss Anne Elliott sang very well , though I thought she over-emphasised one line of the stanza : `` This world is a world of lies ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1634 len. 12]: Perhaps she had poisoned another little arrow for me , too .
Parsing [sent. 1635 len. 49]: Impelled by the fine night , the groups upon the terrace were tending toward a wider dispersal , drifting over the sloping lawns by threes and couples , and I was able to identify two figures threading the paths of the garden , together , some distance below .
Parsing [sent. 1636 len. 25]: Judging by the pace they kept , I should have concluded that Miss Ward and Mr. Cresson Ingle sought the healthful effects of exercise .
Parsing [sent. 1637 len. 41]: However , I could see no good reason for wishing their conversation less obviously absorbing , though Miss Elliott 's insinuation that Mr. Ingle might deplore intrusion upon the interview had struck me as too definite to be altogether pleasing .
Parsing [sent. 1638 len. 12]: Still , such matters could not discontent me with my solitude .
Parsing [sent. 1639 len. 36]: Eastward , over the moonlit roof of the forest , I could see the quiet ocean , its unending lines of foam moving slowly to the long beaches , too far away to be heard .
Parsing [sent. 1640 len. 125]: The reproachful voice of the singer came no more from the house , but the piano ran on into `` La Vie de Boheme , '' and out of that into something else , I did not know what , but it seemed to be music ; at least it was musical enough to bring before me some memory of the faces of pretty girls I had danced with long ago in my dancing days , so that , what with the music , and the distant sea , and the soft air , so sparklingly full of moonshine , and the little dancing memories , I was floated off into a reverie that was like a prelude for the person who broke it .
Parsing [sent. 1641 len. 21]: She came so quietly that I did not hear her until she was almost beside me and spoke to me .
Parsing [sent. 1642 len. 9]: It was the second time that had happened .
Parsing [sent. 1643 len. 30]: CHAPTER XII `` Mrs. Harman , '' I said , as she took the chair vacated by the elfin young lady , `` you see I can manage it !
Parsing [sent. 1644 len. 15]: But perhaps I control myself better when there 's no camp-stool to inspire me .
Parsing [sent. 1645 len. 10]: You remember my woodland didoes -- I fear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1646 len. 51]: She smiled in a pleasant , comprehending way , but neither directly replied nor made any return speech whatever ; instead , she let her forearms rest on the broad railing of the marble balustrade , and , leaning forward , gazed out over the shining and mysterious slopes below .
Parsing [sent. 1647 len. 43]: Somehow it seemed to me that her not answering , and her quiet action , as well as the thoughtful attitude in which it culminated , would have been thought `` very like her '' by any one who knew her well .
Parsing [sent. 1648 len. 28]: `` Cousin Louise has her ways , '' Miss Elizabeth had told me ; this was probably one of them , and I found it singularly attractive .
Parsing [sent. 1649 len. 32]: For that matter , from the day of my first sight of her in the woods I had needed no prophet to tell me I should like Mrs. Harman 's ways .
Parsing [sent. 1650 len. 29]: `` After the quiet you have had here , all this must seem , '' I said , looking down upon the strollers , `` a usurpation . ''
Parsing [sent. 1651 len. 6]: `` Oh , they ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1652 len. 15]: She disposed of Quesnay 's guests with a slight movement of her left hand .
Parsing [sent. 1653 len. 25]: `` You 're an old friend of my cousins -- of both of them ; but even without that , I know you understand .
Parsing [sent. 1654 len. 12]: Elizabeth does it all for her brother , of course . ''
Parsing [sent. 1655 len. 10]: `` But she likes it , '' I said .
Parsing [sent. 1656 len. 14]: `` And Mr. Ward likes it , too , '' she added slowly .
Parsing [sent. 1657 len. 11]: `` You 'll see , when he comes home . ''
Parsing [sent. 1658 len. 23]: Night 's effect upon me being always to make me venturesome , I took a chance , and ventured perhaps too far .
Parsing [sent. 1659 len. 15]: `` I hope we 'll see many happy things when he comes home . ''
Parsing [sent. 1660 len. 39]: `` It 's her doing things of this sort , '' she said , giving no sign of having heard my remark , `` that has helped so much to make him the success that he is . ''
Parsing [sent. 1661 len. 12]: `` It 's what has been death to his art ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1662 len. 16]: I exclaimed , too quickly -- and would have been glad to recall the speech .
Parsing [sent. 1663 len. 13]: She met it with a murmur of low laughter that sounded pitying .
Parsing [sent. 1664 len. 15]: `` Was n't it always a dubious relation -- between him and art ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1665 len. 25]: And without awaiting an answer , she went on , `` So it 's all the better that he can have his success ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1666 len. 9]: To this I had nothing whatever to say .
Parsing [sent. 1667 len. 47]: So far as I remembered , I had never before heard a woman put so much comprehension of a large subject into so few words , but in my capacity as George 's friend , hopeful for his happiness , it made me a little uneasy .
Parsing [sent. 1668 len. 50]: During the ensuing pause this feeling , at first uppermost , gave way to another not at all in sequence , but irresponsible and intuitive , that she had something in particular to say to me , had joined me for that purpose , and was awaiting the opportunity .
Parsing [sent. 1669 len. 41]: As I have made open confession , my curiosity never needed the spur ; and there is no denying that this impression set it off on the gallop ; but evidently the moment had not come for her to speak .
Parsing [sent. 1670 len. 12]: She seemed content to gaze out over the valley in silence .
Parsing [sent. 1671 len. 21]: `` Mr. Cresson Ingle , '' I hazarded ; `` is he an old , new friend of your cousins ?
Parsing [sent. 1672 len. 19]: I think he was not above the horizon when I went to Capri , two years ago ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1673 len. 19]: `` He wants Elizabeth , '' she returned , adding quietly , `` as you 've seen . ''
Parsing [sent. 1674 len. 31]: And when I had verified this assumption with a monosyllable , she continued , `` He 's an ` available , ' but I should hate to have it happen .
Parsing [sent. 1675 len. 5]: He 's hard . ''
Parsing [sent. 1676 len. 36]: `` He does n't seem very hard toward her , '' I murmured , looking down into the garden where Mr. Ingle just then happened to be adjusting a scarf about his hostess 's shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 1677 len. 19]: `` He 's led a detestable life , '' said Mrs. Harman , `` among detestable people ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1678 len. 14]: She spoke with sudden , remarkable vigour , and as if she knew .
Parsing [sent. 1679 len. 54]: The full - throated emphasis she put upon `` detestable '' gave the word the sting of a flagellation ; it rang with a rightful indignation that brought vividly to my mind the thought of those three years in Mrs. Harman 's life which Elizabeth said `` hurt one to think of . ''
Parsing [sent. 1680 len. 32]: For this was the lady who had rejected good George Ward to run away with a man much deeper in all that was detestable than Mr. Cresson Ingle could ever be !
Parsing [sent. 1681 len. 17]: `` He seems to me much of a type with these others , '' I said .
Parsing [sent. 1682 len. 12]: `` Oh , they keep their surfaces about the same . ''
Parsing [sent. 1683 len. 19]: `` It made me wish _ I _ had a little more surface to-night , '' I laughed .
Parsing [sent. 1684 len. 7]: `` I 'd have fitted better .
Parsing [sent. 1685 len. 8]: Miss Ward is different at different times .
Parsing [sent. 1686 len. 42]: When we are alone together she always has the air of excusing , or at least explaining , these people to me , but this evening I 've had the disquieting thought that perhaps she also explained me to them . ''
Parsing [sent. 1687 len. 6]: `` Oh , no ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1688 len. 9]: said Mrs. Harman , turning to me quickly .
Parsing [sent. 1689 len. 6]: `` Did n't you see ?
Parsing [sent. 1690 len. 11]: She was making up to Mr. Ingle for this morning .
Parsing [sent. 1691 len. 26]: It came out that she 'd ridden over at daylight to see you ; Anne Elliott discovered it in some way and told him . ''
Parsing [sent. 1692 len. 44]: This presented an aspect of things so overwhelmingly novel that out of a confusion of ideas I was able to fasten on only one with which to continue the conversation , and I said irrelevantly that Miss Elliott was a remarkable young woman .
Parsing [sent. 1693 len. 45]: At this my companion , who had renewed her observation of the valley , gave me a full , clear look of earnest scrutiny , which set me on the alert , for I thought that now what she desired to say was coming .
Parsing [sent. 1694 len. 16]: But I was disappointed , for she spoke lightly , with a ripple of amusement .
Parsing [sent. 1695 len. 8]: `` I suppose she finished her investigations ?
Parsing [sent. 1696 len. 8]: You told her all you could ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1697 len. 4]: `` Almost . ''
Parsing [sent. 1698 len. 13]: `` I suppose you would n't trust ME with the reservation ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1699 len. 5]: she asked , smiling .
Parsing [sent. 1700 len. 13]: `` I would trust you with anything , '' I answered seriously .
Parsing [sent. 1701 len. 9]: `` You did n't gratify that child ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1702 len. 6]: she said , half laughing .
Parsing [sent. 1703 len. 57]: Then , to my surprise , her tone changed suddenly , and she began again in a hurried low voice : `` You did n't tell her -- '' and stopped there , breathless and troubled , letting me see that I had been right after all : this was what she wanted to talk about .
Parsing [sent. 1704 len. 22]: `` I did n't tell her that young Saffren is mad , no ; if that is what you mean . ''
Parsing [sent. 1705 len. 37]: `` I 'm glad you did n't , '' she said slowly , sinking back in her chair so that her face was in the shadow of the awning which sheltered the little table between us .
Parsing [sent. 1706 len. 48]: `` In the first place , I would n't have told her even if it were true , '' I returned , `` and in the second , it is n't true -- though YOU have some reason to think it is , '' I added . ''
Parsing [sent. 1707 len. 5]: _ I _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1708 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 1709 len. 4]: `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1710 len. 31]: `` His speaking to you as he did ; a thing on the face of it inexcusable -- '' `` Why did he call me ` Madame d'Armand ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1711 len. 3]: she interposed .
Parsing [sent. 1712 len. 23]: I explained something of the mental processes of Amedee , and she listened till I had finished ; then bade me continue .
Parsing [sent. 1713 len. 21]: `` That 's all , '' I said blankly , but , with a second thought , caught her meaning .
Parsing [sent. 1714 len. 11]: `` Oh , about young Saffren , you mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1715 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1716 len. 37]: `` I know him pretty well , '' I said , `` without really knowing anything about him ; but what is stranger , I believe he does n't really know a great deal about himself .
Parsing [sent. 1717 len. 14]: Of course I have a theory about him , though it 's vague .
Parsing [sent. 1718 len. 31]: My idea is that probably through some great illness he lost -- not his faculty of memory , but his memories , or , at least , most of them .
Parsing [sent. 1719 len. 22]: In regard to what he does remember , Professor Keredec has anxiously impressed upon him some very poignant necessity for reticence .
Parsing [sent. 1720 len. 31]: What the necessity may be , or the nature of the professor 's anxieties , I do not know , but I think Keredec 's reasons must be good ones .
Parsing [sent. 1721 len. 41]: That 's all , except that there 's something about the young man that draws one to him : I could n't tell you how much I like him , nor how sorry I am that he offended you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1722 len. 14]: `` He did n't offend me , '' she murmured -- almost whispered .
Parsing [sent. 1723 len. 12]: `` He did n't mean to , '' I said warmly .
Parsing [sent. 1724 len. 6]: `` You understood that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1725 len. 7]: `` Yes , I understood . ''
Parsing [sent. 1726 len. 5]: `` I am glad .
Parsing [sent. 1727 len. 28]: I 'd been waiting the chance to try to explain -- to ask you to pardon him -- '' `` But there was n't any need . ''
Parsing [sent. 1728 len. 21]: `` You mean because you understood -- '' `` No , '' she interrupted gently , `` not only that .
Parsing [sent. 1729 len. 10]: I mean because he has done it himself . ''
Parsing [sent. 1730 len. 6]: `` Asked your pardon ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1731 len. 7]: I said , in complete surprise .
Parsing [sent. 1732 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1733 len. 7]: `` He 's written you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1734 len. 3]: I cried .
Parsing [sent. 1735 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 1736 len. 9]: I saw him to-day , '' she answered .
Parsing [sent. 1737 len. 39]: `` This afternoon when I went for my walk , he was waiting where the paths intersect -- '' Some hasty ejaculation , I do not know what , came from me , but she lifted her hand .
Parsing [sent. 1738 len. 8]: `` Wait , '' she said quietly .
Parsing [sent. 1739 len. 30]: `` As soon as he saw me he came straight toward me -- '' `` Oh , but this wo n't do at all , '' I broke out .
Parsing [sent. 1740 len. 11]: `` It 's too bad -- '' `` Wait . ''
Parsing [sent. 1741 len. 10]: She leaned forward slightly , lifting her hand again .
Parsing [sent. 1742 len. 21]: `` He called me ` Madame d'Armand , ' and said he must know if he had offended me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1743 len. 15]: `` You told him -- '' `` I told him ` No ! ' ''
Parsing [sent. 1744 len. 26]: And it seemed to me that her voice , which up to this point had been low but very steady , shook upon the monosyllable .
Parsing [sent. 1745 len. 27]: `` He walked with me a little way -- perhaps It was longer -- '' `` Trust me that it sha 'n' t happen again ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1746 len. 3]: I exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 1747 len. 12]: `` I 'll see that Keredec knows of this at once .
Parsing [sent. 1748 len. 26]: He will -- '' `` No , no , '' she interrupted quickly , `` that is just what I want you not to do .
Parsing [sent. 1749 len. 6]: Will you promise me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1750 len. 9]: `` I 'll promise anything you ask me .
Parsing [sent. 1751 len. 7]: But did n't he frighten you ?
Parsing [sent. 1752 len. 6]: Did n't he talk wildly ?
Parsing [sent. 1753 len. 17]: Did n't he -- '' `` He did n't frighten me -- not as you mean .
Parsing [sent. 1754 len. 42]: He was very quiet and -- '' She broke off unexpectedly , with a little pitying cry , and turned to me , lifting both hands appealingly -- `` And oh , does n't he make one SORRY for him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1755 len. 5]: That was just it .
Parsing [sent. 1756 len. 38]: She had gone straight to the heart of his mystery : his strangeness was the strange PATHOS that invested him ; the `` singularity '' of `` that other monsieur '' was solved for me at last .
Parsing [sent. 1757 len. 26]: When she had spoken she rose , advanced a step , and stood looking out over the valley again , her skirts pressing the balustrade .
Parsing [sent. 1758 len. 64]: One of the moments in my life when I have wished to be a figure painter came then , as she raised her arms , the sleeves , of some filmy texture , falling back from them with the gesture , and clasped her hands lightly behind her neck , the graceful angle of her chin uplifted to the full rain of moonshine .
Parsing [sent. 1759 len. 67]: Little Miss Elliott , in the glamour of these same blue showerings , had borrowed gauzy weavings of the fay and the sprite , but Mrs. Harman -- tall , straight , delicate to fragility , yet not to thinness -- was transfigured with a deeper meaning , wearing the sadder , richer colours of the tragedy that her cruel young romance had put upon her .
Parsing [sent. 1760 len. 37]: She might have posed as she stood against the marble railing -- and especially in that gesture of lifting her arms -- for a bearer of the gift at some foredestined luckless ceremony of votive offerings .
Parsing [sent. 1761 len. 16]: So it seemed , at least , to the eyes of a moon-dazed old painter-man .
Parsing [sent. 1762 len. 62]: She stood in profile to me ; there were some jasmine flowers at her breast ; I could see them rise and fall with more than deep breathing ; and I wondered what the man who had talked of her so wildly , only yesterday , would feel if he could know that already the thought of him had moved her .
Parsing [sent. 1763 len. 8]: `` I have n't HAD my life .
Parsing [sent. 1764 len. 5]: It 's gone ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1765 len. 36]: It was almost as if I heard his voice , close at hand , with all the passion of regret and protest that rang in the words when they broke from him in the forest .
Parsing [sent. 1766 len. 56]: And by some miraculous conjecture , within the moment I seemed not only to hear his voice but actually to see him , a figure dressed in white , far below us and small with the distance , standing out in the moonlight in the middle of the tree-bordered avenue leading to the chateau gates .
Parsing [sent. 1767 len. 8]: I rose and leaned over the railing .
Parsing [sent. 1768 len. 64]: There was no doubt about the reality of the figure in white , though it was too far away to be identified with certainty ; and as I rubbed my eyes for clearer sight , it turned and disappeared into the shadows of the orderly grove where I had stood , one day , to watch Louise Harman ascend the slopes of Quesnay .
Parsing [sent. 1769 len. 50]: But I told myself , sensibly , that more than one man on the coast of Normandy might be wearing white flannels that evening , and , turning to my companion , found that she had moved some steps away from me and was gazing eastward to the sea .
Parsing [sent. 1770 len. 10]: I concluded that she had not seen the figure .
Parsing [sent. 1771 len. 18]: `` I have a request to make of you , '' she said , as I turned .
Parsing [sent. 1772 len. 28]: `` Will you do it for me -- setting it down just as a whim , if you like , and letting it go at that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1773 len. 11]: `` Yes , I will , '' I answered promptly .
Parsing [sent. 1774 len. 9]: `` I 'll do anything you ask . ''
Parsing [sent. 1775 len. 36]: She stepped closer , looked at me intently for a second , bit her lip in indecision , then said , all in a breath : `` Do n't tell Mr. Saffren my name ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1776 len. 12]: `` But I had n't meant to , '' I protested .
Parsing [sent. 1777 len. 21]: `` Do n't speak of me to him at all , '' she said , with the same hurried eagerness .
Parsing [sent. 1778 len. 10]: `` Will you let me have my way ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1779 len. 10]: `` Could there be any question of that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1780 len. 28]: I replied , and to my astonishment found that we had somehow impulsively taken each other 's hands , as upon a serious bargain struck between us .
Parsing [sent. 1781 len. 87]: CHAPTER XIII The round moon was white and at its smallest , high overhead , when I stepped out of the phaeton in which Miss Elizabeth sent me back to Madame Brossard 's ; midnight was twanging from a rusty old clock indoors as I crossed the fragrant courtyard to my pavilion ; but a lamp still burned in the salon of the `` Grande Suite , '' a light to my mind more suggestive of the patient watcher than of the scholar at his tome .
Parsing [sent. 1782 len. 58]: When my own lamp was extinguished , I set my door ajar , moved my bed out from the wall to catch whatever breeze might stir , `` composed myself for the night , '' as it used to be written , and lay looking out upon the quiet garden where a thin white haze was rising .
Parsing [sent. 1783 len. 67]: If , in taking this coign of vantage , I had any subtler purpose than to seek a draught against the warmth of the night , it did not fail of its reward , for just as I had begun to drowse , the gallery steps creaked as if beneath some immoderate weight , and the noble form of Keredec emerged upon my field of vision .
Parsing [sent. 1784 len. 20]: From the absence of the sound of footsteps I supposed him to be either barefooted or in his stockings .
Parsing [sent. 1785 len. 39]: His visible costume consisted of a sleeping jacket tucked into a pair of trousers , while his tousled hair and beard and generally tossed and rumpled look were those of a man who had been lying down temporarily .
Parsing [sent. 1786 len. 27]: I heard him sigh -- like one sighing for sleep -- as he went noiselessly across the garden and out through the archway to the road .
Parsing [sent. 1787 len. 22]: At that I sat straight up in bed to stare -- and well I might , for here was a miracle !
Parsing [sent. 1788 len. 54]: He had lifted his arms above his head to stretch himself comfortably , and he walked upright and at ease , whereas when I had last seen him , the night before , he had been able to do little more than crawl , bent far over and leaning painfully upon his friend .
Parsing [sent. 1789 len. 14]: Never man beheld a more astonishing recovery from a bad case of rheumatism !
Parsing [sent. 1790 len. 41]: After a long look down the road , he retraced his steps ; and the moonlight , striking across his great forehead as he came , revealed the furrows ploughed there by an anxiety of which I guessed the cause .
Parsing [sent. 1791 len. 24]: The creaking of the wooden stairs and gallery and the whine of an old door announced that he had returned to his vigil .
Parsing [sent. 1792 len. 61]: I had , perhaps , a quarter of an hour to consider this performance , when it was repeated ; now , however , he only glanced out into the road , retreating hastily , and I saw that he was smiling , while the speed he maintained in returning to his quarters was remarkable for one so newly convalescent .
Parsing [sent. 1793 len. 38]: The next moment Saffron came through the archway , ascended the steps in turn -- but slowly and carefully , as if fearful of waking his guardian -- and I heard his door closing , very gently .
Parsing [sent. 1794 len. 34]: Long before his arrival , however , I had been certain of his identity with the figure I had seen gazing up at the terraces of Quesnay from the borders of the grove .
Parsing [sent. 1795 len. 34]: Other questions remained to bother me : Why had Keredec not prevented this night-roving , and why , since he did permit it , should he conceal his knowledge of it from Oliver ?
Parsing [sent. 1796 len. 17]: And what , oh , what wondrous specific had the mighty man found for his disease ?
Parsing [sent. 1797 len. 19]: Morning failed to clarify these mysteries ; it brought , however , something rare and rich and strange .
Parsing [sent. 1798 len. 10]: I allude to the manner of Amedee 's approach .
Parsing [sent. 1799 len. 65]: The aged gossip-demoniac had to recognise the fact that he could not keep out of my way for ever ; there was nothing for it but to put as good a face as possible upon a bad business , and get it over -- and the face he selected was a marvel ; not less , and in no hasty sense of the word .
Parsing [sent. 1800 len. 12]: It appeared at my door to announce that breakfast waited outside .
Parsing [sent. 1801 len. 42]: Primarily it displayed an expression of serenity , masterly in its assumption that not the least , remotest , dreamiest shadow of danger could possibly be conceived , by the most immoderately pessimistic and sinister imagination , as even vaguely threatening .
Parsing [sent. 1802 len. 23]: And for the rest , you have seen a happy young mother teaching first steps to the first-born -- that was Amedee .
Parsing [sent. 1803 len. 59]: Radiantly tender , aggressively solicitous , diffusing ineffable sweetness on the air , wreathed in seraphic smiles , beaming caressingly , and aglow with a sacred joy that I should be looking so well , he greeted me in a voice of honey and bowed me to my repast with an unconcealed fondness at once maternal and reverential .
Parsing [sent. 1804 len. 7]: I did not attempt to speak .
Parsing [sent. 1805 len. 44]: I came out silently , uncannily fascinated , my eyes fixed upon him , while he moved gently backward , cooing pleasant words about the coffee , but just perceptibly keeping himself out of arm 's reach until I had taken my seat .
Parsing [sent. 1806 len. 25]: When I had done that , he leaned over the table and began to set useless things nearer my plate with frankly affectionate care .
Parsing [sent. 1807 len. 36]: It chanced that in `` making a long arm '' to reach something I did want , my hand -LRB- of which the fingers happened to be closed -RRB- passed rather impatiently beneath his nose .
Parsing [sent. 1808 len. 52]: The madonna expression changed instantly to one of horror , he uttered a startled croak , and took a surprisingly long skip backward , landing in the screen of honeysuckle vines , which , he seemed to imagine , were some new form of hostility attacking him treacherously from the rear .
Parsing [sent. 1809 len. 38]: They sagged , but did not break from their fastenings , and his behaviour , as he lay thus entangled , would have contrasted unfavourably in dignity with the actions of a panic-stricken hen in a hammock .
Parsing [sent. 1810 len. 22]: `` And so conscience DOES make cowards of us all , '' I said , with no hope of being understood .
Parsing [sent. 1811 len. 38]: Recovering some measure of mental equilibrium at the same time that he managed to find his feet , he burst into shrill laughter , to which he tried in vain to impart a ring of debonair carelessness .
Parsing [sent. 1812 len. 7]: `` Eh , I stumble ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1813 len. 6]: he cried with hollow merriment .
Parsing [sent. 1814 len. 9]: `` I fall about and faint with fatigue !
Parsing [sent. 1815 len. 2]: Pah !
Parsing [sent. 1816 len. 8]: But it is nothing : truly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1817 len. 4]: `` Fatigue ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1818 len. 8]: I turned a bitter sneer upon him .
Parsing [sent. 1819 len. 3]: `` Fatigue !
Parsing [sent. 1820 len. 8]: And you just out of bed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1821 len. 28]: His fat hands went up palm outward ; his heroic laughter was checked as with a sob ; an expression of tragic incredulity shone from his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1822 len. 22]: Patently he doubted the evidence of his own ears ; could not believe that such black ingratitude existed in the world .
Parsing [sent. 1823 len. 9]: `` Absalom , O my son Absalom ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1824 len. 5]: was his unuttered cry .
Parsing [sent. 1825 len. 32]: His hands fell to his sides ; his chin sank wretchedly into its own folds ; his shirt-bosom heaved and crinkled ; arrows of unspeakable injustice had entered the defenceless breast .
Parsing [sent. 1826 len. 7]: `` Just out of bed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1827 len. 54]: he repeated , with a pathos that would have brought the judge of any court in France down from the bench to kiss him -- `` And I had risen long , long before the dawn , in the cold and darkness of the night , to prepare the sandwiches of monsieur ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1828 len. 13]: It was too much for me , or rather , he was .
Parsing [sent. 1829 len. 49]: I stalked off to the woods in a state of helpless indignation ; mentally swearing that his day of punishment at my hands was only deferred , not abandoned , yet secretly fearing that this very oath might live for no purpose but to convict me of perjury .
Parsing [sent. 1830 len. 18]: His talents were lost in the country ; he should have sought his fortune in the metropolis .
Parsing [sent. 1831 len. 39]: And his manner , as he summoned me that evening to dinner , and indeed throughout the courses , partook of the subtle condescension and careless assurance of one who has but faintly enjoyed some too easy triumph .
Parsing [sent. 1832 len. 43]: I found this so irksome that I might have been goaded into an outbreak of impotent fury , had my attention not been distracted by the curious turn of the professor 's malady , which had renewed its painful assault upon him .
Parsing [sent. 1833 len. 43]: He came hobbling to table , leaning upon Saffren 's shoulder , and made no reference to his singular improvement of the night before -- nor did I. His rheumatism was his own ; he might do what he pleased with it !
Parsing [sent. 1834 len. 16]: There was no reason why he should confide the cause of its vagaries to me .
Parsing [sent. 1835 len. 21]: Table-talk ran its normal course ; a great Pole 's philosophy receiving flagellation at the hands of our incorrigible optimist .
Parsing [sent. 1836 len. 25]: -LRB- `` If he could understand , '' exclaimed Keredec , `` that the individual must be immortal before it is born , ha !
Parsing [sent. 1837 len. 11]: then this babbler might have writted some intelligence ! '' -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 1838 len. 51]: On the surface everything was as usual with our trio , with nothing to show any turbulence of under-currents , unless it was a certain alertness in Oliver 's manner , a restrained excitement , and the questioning restlessness of his eyes as they sought mine from time to time .
Parsing [sent. 1839 len. 27]: Whatever he wished to ask me , he was given no opportunity , for the professor carried him off to work when our coffee was finished .
Parsing [sent. 1840 len. 69]: As they departed , the young man glanced back at me over his shoulder , with that same earnest look of interrogation , but it went unanswered by any token or gesture : for though I guessed that he wished to know if Mrs. Harman had spoken of him to me , it seemed part of my bargain with her to give him no sign that I understood .
Parsing [sent. 1841 len. 24]: A note lay beside my plate next morning , addressed in a writing strange to me , one of dashing and vigorous character .
Parsing [sent. 1842 len. 47]: `` In the pursuit of thrillingly scientific research , '' it read , `` what with the tumult which possessed me , I forgot to mention the bond that links us ; I , too , am a painter , though as yet unhonoured and unhung .
Parsing [sent. 1843 len. 14]: It must be only because I lack a gentle hand to guide me .
Parsing [sent. 1844 len. 10]: If I might sit beside you as you paint !
Parsing [sent. 1845 len. 13]: The hours pass on leaden wings at Quesnay -- I could shriek !
Parsing [sent. 1846 len. 53]: Do not refuse me a few words of instruction , either in the wildwood , whither I could support your shrinking steps , or , from time to time , as you work in your studio , which -LRB- I glean from the instructive Mr. Ferret -RRB- is at Les Trois Pigeons .
Parsing [sent. 1847 len. 14]: At any hour , at any moment , I will speed to you .
Parsing [sent. 1848 len. 23]: I am , sir , `` Yours , if you will but breathe a ` yes , ' `` ANNE ELLIOTT . ''
Parsing [sent. 1849 len. 36]: To this I returned a reply , as much in her own key as I could write it , putting my refusal on the ground that I was not at present painting in the studio .
Parsing [sent. 1850 len. 40]: I added that I hoped her suit might prosper , regretting that I could not be of greater assistance to that end , and concluded with the suggestion that Madame Brossard might entertain an offer for lessons in cooking .
Parsing [sent. 1851 len. 29]: The result of my attempt to echo her vivacity was discomfiting , and I was allowed to perceive that epistolary jocularity was not thought to be my line .
Parsing [sent. 1852 len. 24]: It was Miss Elizabeth who gave me this instruction three days later , on the way to Quesnay for `` second breakfast . ''
Parsing [sent. 1853 len. 31]: Exercising fairly shame-faced diplomacy , I had avoided dining at the chateau again , but , by arrangement , she had driven over for me this morning in the phaeton .
Parsing [sent. 1854 len. 12]: `` Why are you writing silly notes to that child ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1855 len. 13]: she demanded , as soon as we were away from the inn .
Parsing [sent. 1856 len. 6]: `` Was it silly ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1857 len. 5]: `` You should know .
Parsing [sent. 1858 len. 14]: Do you think that style of humour suitable for a young girl ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1859 len. 6]: This bewildered me a little .
Parsing [sent. 1860 len. 13]: `` But there was n't anything offensive -- '' `` No ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1861 len. 12]: Miss Elizabeth lifted her eyebrows to a height of bland inquiry .
Parsing [sent. 1862 len. 12]: `` She might n't think it rather -- well , rough ?
Parsing [sent. 1863 len. 10]: Your suggesting that she should take cooking lessons ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1864 len. 16]: `` But SHE suggested she might take PAINTING lessons , '' was my feeble protest .
Parsing [sent. 1865 len. 19]: `` I only meant to show her I understood that she wanted to get to the inn . ''
Parsing [sent. 1866 len. 15]: `` And why should she care to ` get to the inn ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1867 len. 13]: `` She seemed interested in a young man who is staying there .
Parsing [sent. 1868 len. 15]: ` Interested ' is the mildest word for it I can think of . ''
Parsing [sent. 1869 len. 4]: `` Pooh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1870 len. 18]: Such was Miss Ward 's enigmatic retort , and though I begged an explanation I got none .
Parsing [sent. 1871 len. 13]: Instead , she quickened the horse 's gait and changed the subject .
Parsing [sent. 1872 len. 50]: At the chateau , having a mind to offer some sort of apology , I looked anxiously about for the subject of our rather disquieting conversation , but she was not to be seen until the party assembled at the table , set under an awning on the terrace .
Parsing [sent. 1873 len. 76]: Then , to my disappointment , I found no opportunity to speak to her , for her seat was so placed as to make it impossible , and she escaped into the house immediately upon the conclusion of the repast , hurrying away too pointedly for any attempt to detain her -- though , as she passed , she sent me one glance of meek reproach which she was at pains to make elaborately distinct .
Parsing [sent. 1874 len. 57]: Again taking me for her neighbour at the table , Miss Elizabeth talked to me at intervals , apparently having nothing , just then , to make up to Mr. Cresson Ingle , but not long after we rose she accompanied him upon some excursion of an indefinite nature , which led her from my sight .
Parsing [sent. 1875 len. 53]: Thus , the others making off to cards indoors and what not , I was left to the perusal of the eighteenth century facade of the chateau , one of the most competent restorations in that part of France , and of the liveliest interest to the student or practitioner of architecture .
Parsing [sent. 1876 len. 62]: Mrs. Harman had not appeared at all , having gone to call upon some one at Dives , I was told , and a servant informing me -LRB- on inquiry -RRB- that Miss Elliott had retired to her room , I was thrust upon my own devices indeed , a condition already closely associated in my mind with this picturesque spot .
Parsing [sent. 1877 len. 26]: The likeliest of my devices -- or , at least , the one I hit upon -- was in the nature of an unostentatious retreat .
Parsing [sent. 1878 len. 4]: I went home .
Parsing [sent. 1879 len. 78]: However , as the day was spoiled for work , I chose a roundabout way , in fact the longest , and took the high-road to Dives , but neither the road nor the town itself -LRB- when I passed through it -RRB- rewarded my vague hope that I might meet Mrs. Harman , and I strode the long miles in considerable disgruntlement , for it was largely in that hope that I had gone to Quesnay .
Parsing [sent. 1880 len. 66]: It put me in no merrier mood to find Miss Elizabeth 's phaeton standing outside the inn in charge of a groom , for my vanity encouraged the supposition that she had come out of a fear that my unceremonious departure from Quesnay might have indicated that I was `` hurt , '' or considered myself neglected ; and I dreaded having to make explanations .
Parsing [sent. 1881 len. 37]: My apprehensions were unfounded ; it was not Miss Elizabeth who had come in the phaeton , though a lady from Quesnay did prove to be the occupant -- the sole occupant -- of the courtyard .
Parsing [sent. 1882 len. 13]: At sight of her I halted stock - still under the archway .
Parsing [sent. 1883 len. 41]: There she sat , a sketch-book on a green table beside her and a board in her lap , brazenly painting -- and a more blushless piece of assurance than Miss Anne Elliott thus engaged these eyes have never beheld .
Parsing [sent. 1884 len. 43]: She was not so hardened that she did not affect a little timidity at sight of me , looking away even more quickly than she looked up , while I walked slowly over to her and took the garden chair beside her .
Parsing [sent. 1885 len. 29]: That gave me a view of her sketch , which was a violent little `` lay-in '' of shrubbery , trees , and the sky-line of the inn .
Parsing [sent. 1886 len. 32]: To my prodigious surprise -LRB- and , naturally enough , with a degree of pleasure -RRB- I perceived that it was not very bad , not bad at all , indeed .
Parsing [sent. 1887 len. 23]: It displayed a sense of values , of placing , and even , in a young and frantic way , of colour .
Parsing [sent. 1888 len. 12]: Here was a young woman of more than `` accomplishments ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1889 len. 43]: `` You see , '' she said , squeezing one of the tiny tubes almost dry , and continuing to paint with a fine effect of absorption , `` I HAD to show you that I was in the most ABYSMAL earnest .
Parsing [sent. 1890 len. 10]: Will you take me painting with , you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1891 len. 10]: `` I appreciate your seriousness , '' I rejoined .
Parsing [sent. 1892 len. 7]: `` Has it been rewarded ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1893 len. 6]: `` How can I say ?
Parsing [sent. 1894 len. 17]: You have n't told me whether or no I may follow you to the wildwood . ''
Parsing [sent. 1895 len. 14]: `` I mean , have you caught another glimpse of Mr. Saffren ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1896 len. 41]: At that she showed a prettier colour in her cheeks than any in her sketch-box , but gave no other sign of shame , nor even of being flustered , cheerfully replying : `` That is far from the point .
Parsing [sent. 1897 len. 8]: Do you grant my burning plea ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1898 len. 9]: `` I understood I had offended you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1899 len. 8]: `` You did , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 1900 len. 4]: `` VICIOUSLY ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1901 len. 9]: `` I am sorry , '' I continued .
Parsing [sent. 1902 len. 66]: `` I wanted to ask you to forgive me -- '' I spoke seriously , and that seemed to strike her as odd or needing explanation , for she levelled her blue eyes at me , and interrupted , with something more like seriousness in her own voice than I had yet heard from her : `` What made you think I was offended ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1903 len. 17]: `` Your look of reproach when you left the table -- '' `` Nothing else ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1904 len. 4]: she asked quickly .
Parsing [sent. 1905 len. 11]: `` Yes ; Miss Ward told me you were . ''
Parsing [sent. 1906 len. 9]: `` Yes ; she drove over with you .
Parsing [sent. 1907 len. 5]: That 's it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1908 len. 19]: she exclaimed with vigour , and nodded her head as if some suspicion of hers had been confirmed .
Parsing [sent. 1909 len. 6]: `` I thought so ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1910 len. 9]: `` You thought she had told me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1911 len. 9]: `` No , '' said Miss Elliott decidedly .
Parsing [sent. 1912 len. 15]: `` Thought that Elizabeth wanted to have her cake and eat it too . ''
Parsing [sent. 1913 len. 7]: `` I do n't understand . ''
Parsing [sent. 1914 len. 22]: `` Then you 'll get no help from me , '' she returned slowly , a frown marking her pretty forehead .
Parsing [sent. 1915 len. 13]: `` But I was only playing offended , and she knew it .
Parsing [sent. 1916 len. 9]: I thought your note was THAT fetching ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1917 len. 40]: She continued to look thoughtful for a moment longer , then with a resumption of her former manner -- the pretence of an earnestness much deeper than the real -- `` Will you take me painting with you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1918 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 1919 len. 35]: `` If it will convince you that I mean it , I 'll give up my hopes of seeing that SUMPTUOUS Mr. Saffren and go back to Quesnay now , before he comes home .
Parsing [sent. 1920 len. 28]: He 's been out for a walk -- a long one , since it 's lasted ever since early this morning , so the waiter told me .
Parsing [sent. 1921 len. 6]: May I go with you ?
Parsing [sent. 1922 len. 31]: You CA N'T know how enervating it is up there at the chateau -- all except Mrs. Harman , and even she -- '' `` What about Mrs. Harman ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1923 len. 7]: I asked , as she paused .
Parsing [sent. 1924 len. 10]: `` I think she must be in love . ''
Parsing [sent. 1925 len. 4]: `` What ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1926 len. 11]: `` I do think so , '' said the girl .
Parsing [sent. 1927 len. 10]: `` She 's LIKE it , at least . ''
Parsing [sent. 1928 len. 6]: `` But with whom ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1929 len. 4]: She laughed gaily .
Parsing [sent. 1930 len. 10]: `` I 'm afraid she 's my rival ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1931 len. 8]: `` Not with -- '' I began .
Parsing [sent. 1932 len. 12]: `` Yes , with your beautiful and mad young friend . ''
Parsing [sent. 1933 len. 10]: `` But -- oh , it 's preposterous ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1934 len. 6]: I cried , profoundly disturbed .
Parsing [sent. 1935 len. 6]: `` She could n't be !
Parsing [sent. 1936 len. 19]: If you knew a great deal about her -- '' `` I may know more than you think .
Parsing [sent. 1937 len. 19]: My simplicity of appearance is deceptive , '' she mocked , beginning to set her sketch-box in order .
Parsing [sent. 1938 len. 32]: `` You do n't realise that Mrs. Harman and I are quite HURLED upon each other at Quesnay , being two ravishingly intelligent women entirely surrounded by large bodies of elementals .
Parsing [sent. 1939 len. 37]: She has told me a great deal of herself since that first evening , and I know -- well , I know why she did not come back from Dives this afternoon , for instance . ''
Parsing [sent. 1940 len. 4]: `` WHY ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1941 len. 4]: I fairly shouted .
Parsing [sent. 1942 len. 23]: She slid her sketch into a groove in the box , which she closed , and rose to her feet before answering .
Parsing [sent. 1943 len. 41]: Then she set her hat a little straighter with a touch , looking so fixedly and with such grave interest over my shoulder that I turned to follow her glance and encountered our reflections in a window of the inn .
Parsing [sent. 1944 len. 13]: Her own shed a light upon THAT mystery , at all events .
Parsing [sent. 1945 len. 28]: `` I might tell you some day , '' she said indifferently , `` if I gained enough confidence in you through association in daily pursuits . ''
Parsing [sent. 1946 len. 30]: `` My dear young lady , '' I cried with real exasperation , `` I am a working man , and this is a working summer for me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1947 len. 10]: `` Do you think I 'd spoil it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1948 len. 4]: she urged gently .
Parsing [sent. 1949 len. 43]: `` But I get up with the first daylight to paint , '' I protested , `` and I paint all day -- '' She moved a step nearer me and laid her hand warningly upon my sleeve , checking the outburst .
Parsing [sent. 1950 len. 8]: I turned to see what she meant .
Parsing [sent. 1951 len. 16]: Oliver Saffren had come in from the road and was crossing to the gallery steps .
Parsing [sent. 1952 len. 33]: He lifted his hat and gave me a quick word of greeting as he passed , and at the sight of his flushed and happy face my riddle was solved for me .
Parsing [sent. 1953 len. 14]: Amazing as the thing was , I had no doubt of the revelation .
Parsing [sent. 1954 len. 33]: `` Ah , '' I said to Miss Elliott when he had gone , `` I wo n't have to take pupils to get the answer to my question , now ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1955 len. 39]: CHAPTER XIV `` Ha , these philosophers , '' said the professor , expanding in discourse a little later -- `` these dreamy people who talk of the spirit , they tell you that spirit is abstract ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1956 len. 33]: He waved his great hand in a sweeping semicircle which carried it out of our orange candle-light and freckled it with the cold moonshine which sieved through the loosened screen of honeysuckle .
Parsing [sent. 1957 len. 7]: `` Ha , the folly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1958 len. 9]: `` What do YOU say it is ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1959 len. 25]: I asked , moving so that the smoke of my cigar should not drift toward Oliver , who sat looking out into the garden .
Parsing [sent. 1960 len. 6]: `` I , my friend ?
Parsing [sent. 1961 len. 8]: I do not say that it IS !
Parsing [sent. 1962 len. 33]: But all such things , they are only a question of names , and when I use the word ` spirit ' I mean identity -- universal identity , if you like .
Parsing [sent. 1963 len. 15]: It is what we all are , yes -- and those flowers , too .
Parsing [sent. 1964 len. 28]: But the spirit of the flowers is not what you smell , nor what you see , that look so pretty : it is the flowers themself !
Parsing [sent. 1965 len. 35]: Yet all spirit is only one spirit and one spirit is all spirit -- and if you tell me this is Pant ` eism I will tell you that you do not understand ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1966 len. 19]: `` I do n't tell you that , '' said I , `` neither do I understand . ''
Parsing [sent. 1967 len. 8]: `` Nor that big Keredec either ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1968 len. 10]: Whereupon he loosed the rolling thunder of his laughter .
Parsing [sent. 1969 len. 10]: `` Nor any brain born of the monkey people !
Parsing [sent. 1970 len. 39]: But this world is full of proof that everything that exist is all one thing , and it is the instinct of that , when it draws us together , which makes what we call ` love . '
Parsing [sent. 1971 len. 29]: Even those wicked devils of egoism in our inside is only love which grows too long the wrong way , like the finger nails of the Chinese empress .
Parsing [sent. 1972 len. 10]: Young love is a little sprout of universal unity .
Parsing [sent. 1973 len. 16]: When the young people begin to feel it , THEY are not abstract , ha ?
Parsing [sent. 1974 len. 36]: And the young man , when he selects , he chooses one being from all the others to mean -- just for him -- all that great universe of which he is a part . ''
Parsing [sent. 1975 len. 34]: This was wandering whimsically far afield , but as I caught the good - humoured flicker of the professor 's glance at our companion I thought I saw a purpose in his deviation .
Parsing [sent. 1976 len. 16]: Saffren turned toward him wonderingly , his unconscious , eager look remarkably emphasised and brightened .
Parsing [sent. 1977 len. 16]: `` All such things are most strange -- great mysteries , '' continued the professor .
Parsing [sent. 1978 len. 33]: `` For when a man has made the selection , THAT being DOES become all the universe , and for him there is nothing else at all -- nothing else anywhere ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1979 len. 35]: Saffren 's cheeks and temples were flushed as they had been when I saw him returning that afternoon ; and his eyes were wide , fixed upon Keredec in a stare of utter amazement .
Parsing [sent. 1980 len. 12]: `` Yes , that is true , '' he said slowly .
Parsing [sent. 1981 len. 7]: `` How did you know ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1982 len. 33]: Keredec returned his look with an attentive scrutiny , and made some exclamation under his breath , which I did not catch , but there was no mistaking his high good humour .
Parsing [sent. 1983 len. 4]: `` Bravo ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1984 len. 12]: he shouted , rising and clapping the other upon the shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 1985 len. 15]: `` You will soon cure my rheumatism if you ask me questions like that !
Parsing [sent. 1986 len. 7]: Ho , ho , ho ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1987 len. 12]: He threw back his head and let the mighty salvos forth .
Parsing [sent. 1988 len. 7]: `` Ho , ho , ho !
Parsing [sent. 1989 len. 5]: How do I know ?
Parsing [sent. 1990 len. 16]: The young , always they believe they are the only ones who were ever young !
Parsing [sent. 1991 len. 6]: Ho , ho , ho !
Parsing [sent. 1992 len. 11]: Come , we shall make those lessons very easy to-night .
Parsing [sent. 1993 len. 5]: Come , my friend !
Parsing [sent. 1994 len. 12]: How could that big , old Keredec know of such things ?
Parsing [sent. 1995 len. 8]: He is too old , too foolish !
Parsing [sent. 1996 len. 7]: Ho , ho , ho ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1997 len. 30]: As he went up the steps , the courtyard reverberating again to his laughter , his arm resting on Saffren 's shoulders , but not so heavily as usual .
Parsing [sent. 1998 len. 30]: The door of their salon closed upon them , and for a while Keredec 's voice could be heard booming cheerfully ; it ended in another burst of laughter .
Parsing [sent. 1999 len. 12]: A moment later Saffren opened the door and called to me .
Parsing [sent. 2000 len. 19]: `` Here , '' I answered from my veranda , where I had just lighted my second cigar .
Parsing [sent. 2001 len. 6]: `` No more work to-night .
Parsing [sent. 2002 len. 13]: All finished , '' he cried jubilantly , springing down the steps .
Parsing [sent. 2003 len. 12]: `` I 'm coming to have a talk with you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2004 len. 74]: Amedee had removed the candles , the moon had withdrawn in fear of a turbulent mob of clouds , rioting into our sky from seaward ; the air smelled of imminent rain , and it was so dark that I could see my visitor only as a vague , tall shape ; but a happy excitement vibrated in his rich voice , and his step on the gravelled path was light and exultant .
Parsing [sent. 2005 len. 11]: `` I wo n't sit down , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2006 len. 22]: `` I 'll walk up and down in front of the veranda -- if it does n't make you nervous . ''
Parsing [sent. 2007 len. 29]: For answer I merely laughed ; and he laughed too , in genial response , continuing gaily : `` Oh , it 's all so different with me !
Parsing [sent. 2008 len. 3]: Everything is .
Parsing [sent. 2009 len. 13]: That BLIND feeling I told you of -- it 's all gone .
Parsing [sent. 2010 len. 22]: I must have been very babyish , the other day ; I do n't think I could feel like that again .
Parsing [sent. 2011 len. 65]: It used to seem to me that I lived penned up in a circle of blank stone walls ; I could n't see over the top for myself at all , though now and then Keredec would boost me up and let me get a little glimmer of the country round about -- but never long enough to see what it was really like .
Parsing [sent. 2012 len. 7]: But it 's not so now .
Parsing [sent. 2013 len. 3]: Ah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2014 len. 14]: -- he drew a long breath -- `` I 'd like to run .
Parsing [sent. 2015 len. 35]: I think I could run all the way to the top of a pretty fair-sized mountain to-night , and then '' -- he laughed -- `` jump off and ride on the clouds . ''
Parsing [sent. 2016 len. 11]: `` I know how that is , '' I responded .
Parsing [sent. 2017 len. 13]: `` At least I did know -- a few years ago . ''
Parsing [sent. 2018 len. 29]: `` Everything is a jumble with me , '' he went on happily , in a confidential tone , `` yet it 's a heavenly kind of jumble .
Parsing [sent. 2019 len. 8]: I ca n't put anything into words .
Parsing [sent. 2020 len. 16]: I do n't THINK very well yet , though Keredec is trying to teach me .
Parsing [sent. 2021 len. 26]: My thoughts do n't run in order , and this that 's happened seems to make them wilder , queerer -- '' He stopped short .
Parsing [sent. 2022 len. 6]: `` What has happened ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2023 len. 25]: He paused in his sentry-go , facing me , and answered , in a low voice : `` I 've seen her again . ''
Parsing [sent. 2024 len. 7]: `` Yes , I know . ''
Parsing [sent. 2025 len. 21]: `` She told me you knew it , '' he said , '' -- that she had told you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2026 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 2027 len. 17]: `` But that 's not all , '' he said , his voice rising a little .
Parsing [sent. 2028 len. 18]: `` I saw her again the day after she told you -- '' `` You did ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2029 len. 3]: I murmured .
Parsing [sent. 2030 len. 24]: `` Oh , I tell myself that it 's a dream , '' he cried , `` that it CA N'T be true .
Parsing [sent. 2031 len. 9]: For it has been EVERY day since then !
Parsing [sent. 2032 len. 12]: That 's why I have n't joined you in the woods .
Parsing [sent. 2033 len. 35]: I have been with her , walking with her , listening to her , looking at her -- always feeling that it must be unreal and that I must try not to wake up .
Parsing [sent. 2034 len. 15]: She has been so kind -- so wonderfully , beautifully kind to me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2035 len. 7]: `` She has met you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2036 len. 23]: I asked , thinking ruefully of George Ward , now on the high seas in the pleasant company of old hopes renewed .
Parsing [sent. 2037 len. 8]: `` She has let me meet her .
Parsing [sent. 2038 len. 18]: And to-day we lunched at the inn at Dives and then walked by the sea all afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 2039 len. 11]: She gave me the whole day -- the whole day !
Parsing [sent. 2040 len. 22]: You see '' -- he began to pace again -- `` you see I was right , and you were wrong .
Parsing [sent. 2041 len. 24]: She was n't offended -- she was glad -- that I could n't help speaking to her ; she has said so . ''
Parsing [sent. 2042 len. 21]: `` Do you think , '' I interrupted , `` that she would wish you to tell me this ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2043 len. 8]: `` Ah , she likes you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2044 len. 29]: he said so heartily , and appearing meanwhile so satisfied with the completeness of his reply , that I was fain to take some satisfaction in it myself .
Parsing [sent. 2045 len. 39]: `` What I wanted most to say to you , '' he went on , `` is this : you remember you promised to tell me whatever you could learn about her -- and about her husband ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2046 len. 5]: `` I remember . ''
Parsing [sent. 2047 len. 6]: `` It 's different now .
Parsing [sent. 2048 len. 11]: I do n't want you to , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2049 len. 12]: `` I want only to know what she tells me herself .
Parsing [sent. 2050 len. 20]: She has told me very little , but I know when the time comes she WILL tell me everything .
Parsing [sent. 2051 len. 7]: But I would n't hasten it .
Parsing [sent. 2052 len. 11]: I would n't have anything changed from just THIS ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2053 len. 13]: `` You mean -- '' `` I mean the way it IS .
Parsing [sent. 2054 len. 37]: If I could hope to see her every day , to be in the woods with her , or down by the shore -- oh , I do n't want to know anything but that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2055 len. 27]: `` No doubt you have told her , '' I ventured , `` a good deal about yourself , '' and was instantly ashamed of myself .
Parsing [sent. 2056 len. 72]: I suppose I spoke out of a sense of protest against Mrs. Harman 's strange lack of conventionality , against so charming a lady 's losing her head as completely as she seemed to have lost hers , and it may have been , too , out of a feeling of jealousy for poor George -- possibly even out of a little feeling of the same sort on my own account .
Parsing [sent. 2057 len. 23]: But I could n't have said it except for the darkness , and , as I say , I was instantly ashamed .
Parsing [sent. 2058 len. 14]: It does not whiten my guilt that the shaft did not reach him .
Parsing [sent. 2059 len. 24]: `` I 've told her all I know , '' he said readily , and the unconscious pathos of the answer smote me .
Parsing [sent. 2060 len. 10]: `` And all that Keredec has let me know .
Parsing [sent. 2061 len. 45]: You see I have n't -- '' `` But do you think , '' I interrupted quickly , anxious , in my remorse , to divert him from that channel , `` do you think Professor Keredec would approve , if he knew ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2062 len. 17]: `` I think he would , '' he responded slowly , pausing in his walk again .
Parsing [sent. 2063 len. 38]: `` I have a feeling that perhaps he does know , and yet I have been afraid to tell him , afraid he might try to stop me -- keep me from going to wait for her .
Parsing [sent. 2064 len. 19]: But he has a strange way of knowing things ; I think he knows everything in the world !
Parsing [sent. 2065 len. 31]: I have felt to-night that he knows this , and -- it 's very strange , but I -- well , what WAS it that made him so glad ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2066 len. 15]: `` The light is still burning in his room , '' I said quietly .
Parsing [sent. 2067 len. 11]: `` You mean that I ought to tell him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2068 len. 6]: His voice rose a little .
Parsing [sent. 2069 len. 15]: `` He 's done a good deal for you , has n't he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2070 len. 3]: I suggested .
Parsing [sent. 2071 len. 17]: `` And even if he does know he might like to hear it from you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2072 len. 12]: `` You 're right ; I 'll tell him to-night . ''
Parsing [sent. 2073 len. 14]: This came with sudden decision , but with less than marked what followed .
Parsing [sent. 2074 len. 10]: `` But he ca n't stop me , now .
Parsing [sent. 2075 len. 13]: No one on earth shall do that , except Madame d'Armand herself .
Parsing [sent. 2076 len. 4]: No one ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2077 len. 25]: `` I wo n't quarrel with that , '' I said drily , throwing away my cigar , which had gone out long before .
Parsing [sent. 2078 len. 25]: He hesitated , and then I saw his hand groping toward me in the darkness , and , rising , I gave him mine .
Parsing [sent. 2079 len. 30]: `` Good night , '' he said , and shook my hand as the first sputterings of the coming rain began to patter on the roof of the pavilion .
Parsing [sent. 2080 len. 16]: `` I 'm glad to tell him ; I 'm glad to have told you .
Parsing [sent. 2081 len. 17]: Ah , but is n't this , '' he cried , `` a happy world ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2082 len. 9]: Turning , he ran to the gallery steps .
Parsing [sent. 2083 len. 71]: `` At last I 'm glad , '' he called back over his shoulder , `` I 'm glad that I was born -- '' A gust of wind blew furiously into the courtyard at that instant , and I heard his voice indistinctly , but I thought -- though I might have been mistaken -- that I caught a final word , and that it was `` again . ''
Parsing [sent. 2084 len. 70]: CHAPTER XV The rain of two nights and two days had freshened the woods , deepening the green of the tree-trunks and washing the dust from the leaves , and now , under the splendid sun of the third morning , we sat painting in a sylvan aisle that was like a hall of Aladdin 's palace , the filigreed arches of foliage above us glittering with pendulous rain-drops .
Parsing [sent. 2085 len. 43]: But Arabian Nights ' palaces are not to my fancy for painting ; the air , rinsed of its colour , was too sparklingly clean ; the interstices of sky and the roughly framed distances I prized , were brought too close .
Parsing [sent. 2086 len. 92]: It was one of those days when Nature throws herself straight in your face and you are at a loss to know whether she has kissed you or slapped you , though you are conscious of the tingle ; -- a day , in brief , more for laughing than for painting , and the truth is that I suited its mood only too well , and laughed more than I painted , though I sat with my easel before me and a picture ready upon my palette to be painted .
Parsing [sent. 2087 len. 70]: No one could have understood better than I that this was setting a bad example to the acolyte who sat , likewise facing an easel , ten paces to my left ; a very sportsmanlike figure of a painter indeed , in her short skirt and long coat of woodland brown , the fine brown of dead oak - leaves ; a `` devastating '' selection of colour that !
Parsing [sent. 2088 len. 46]: -- being much the same shade as her hair -- with brown for her hat too , and the veil encircling the small crown thereof , and brown again for the stout , high , laced boots which protected her from the wet tangle underfoot .
Parsing [sent. 2089 len. 19]: Who could have expected so dashing a young person as this to do any real work at painting ?
Parsing [sent. 2090 len. 40]: Yet she did , narrowing her eyes to the finest point of concentration , and applying herself to the task in hand with a persistence which I found , on that particular morning , far beyond my own powers .
Parsing [sent. 2091 len. 99]: As she leaned back critically , at the imminent risk of capsizing her camp-stool , and herself with it , in her absorption , some ill-suppressed token of amusement most have caught her ear , for she turned upon me with suspicion , and was instantly moved to moralize upon the reluctance I had shown to accept her as a companion for my excursions ; taking as her theme , in contrast , her own present display of ambition ; all in all a warm , if over-coloured , sketch of the idle master and the industrious apprentice .
Parsing [sent. 2092 len. 13]: It made me laugh again , upon which she changed the subject .
Parsing [sent. 2093 len. 36]: `` An indefinable something tells me , '' she announced coldly , `` that henceforth you need n't be so DRASTICALLY fearful of being dragged to the chateau for dinner , nor dejeuner either ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2094 len. 15]: `` Did anything ever tell you that I had cause to fear it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2095 len. 11]: `` Yes , '' she said , but too simply .
Parsing [sent. 2096 len. 5]: `` Jean Ferret . ''
Parsing [sent. 2097 len. 25]: `` Anglicise that ruffian 's name , '' I muttered , mirth immediately withering upon me , `` and you 'll know him better .
Parsing [sent. 2098 len. 20]: To save time : will you mention anything you can think of that he HAS N'T told you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2099 len. 36]: Miss Elliott cocked her head upon one side to examine the work of art she was producing , while a slight smile , playing about her lips , seemed to indicate that she was appeased .
Parsing [sent. 2100 len. 16]: `` You and Miss Ward are old and dear friends , are n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2101 len. 4]: she asked absently .
Parsing [sent. 2102 len. 5]: `` We are ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2103 len. 6]: I answered between my teeth .
Parsing [sent. 2104 len. 56]: `` For years I have sent her costly jewels -- '' She interrupted me by breaking outright into a peal of laughter , which rang with such childish delight that I retorted by offering several malevolent observations upon the babbling of French servants and the order of mind attributable to those who listened to them .
Parsing [sent. 2105 len. 17]: Her defence was to affect inattention and paint busily until some time after I had concluded .
Parsing [sent. 2106 len. 30]: `` I think she 's going to take Cressie Ingle , '' she said dreamily , with the air of one whose thoughts have been far , far away .
Parsing [sent. 2107 len. 7]: `` It looks preponderously like it .
Parsing [sent. 2108 len. 17]: She 's been teetertottering these AGES and AGES between you -- '' `` Between whom ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2109 len. 18]: `` You and Mr. Ingle , '' she replied , not altering her tone in the slightest .
Parsing [sent. 2110 len. 76]: `` But she 's all for her brother , of course , and though you 're his friend , Ingle is a personage in the world they court , and among the MULTITUDINOUS things his father left him is an art magazine , or one that 's long on art or something of that sort -- I do n't know just what -- so altogether it will be a good thing for DEAREST Mr. Ward .
Parsing [sent. 2111 len. 28]: She likes Cressie , of course , though I think she likes you better -- '' I managed to find my voice and interrupt the thistle-brained creature .
Parsing [sent. 2112 len. 10]: `` What put these fantasias into your head ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2113 len. 10]: `` Not Jean Ferret , '' she responded promptly .
Parsing [sent. 2114 len. 52]: `` It 's cruel of me to break it to you so coarsely -- I know -- but if you are ever going to make up your mind to her building as glaring a success of you as she has of her brother , I think you must do it now .
Parsing [sent. 2115 len. 26]: She 's on the point of accepting Mr. Ingle , and what becomes of YOU will depend on your conduct in the most immediate future .
Parsing [sent. 2116 len. 21]: She wo n't ask you to Quesnay again , so you 'd better go up there on your own accord .
Parsing [sent. 2117 len. 10]: -- And on your bended knees , too ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2118 len. 6]: she added as an afterthought .
Parsing [sent. 2119 len. 34]: I sought for something to say which might have a chance of impressing her -- a desperate task on the face of it -- and I mentioned that Miss Ward was her hostess .
Parsing [sent. 2120 len. 10]: One might as well have tried to impress Amedee .
Parsing [sent. 2121 len. 15]: She `` made a little mouth '' and went on dabbling with her brushes .
Parsing [sent. 2122 len. 3]: `` Hostess ?
Parsing [sent. 2123 len. 3]: Pooh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2124 len. 4]: she said cheerfully .
Parsing [sent. 2125 len. 19]: `` My INFANTILE father sent me here to be in her charge while he ran home to America .
Parsing [sent. 2126 len. 12]: Mr. Ward 's to paint my portrait , when he comes .
Parsing [sent. 2127 len. 13]: Give and take -- it 's simple enough , you see ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2128 len. 35]: Here was frankness with a vengeance , and I fell back upon silence , whereupon a pause ensued , to my share of which I imparted the deepest shadow of disapproval within my power .
Parsing [sent. 2129 len. 27]: Unfortunately , she did not look at me ; my effort passed with no other effect than to make some of my facial muscles ache . ''
Parsing [sent. 2130 len. 25]: ` Portrait of Miss E. , by George Ward , H. C. , ' '' this painfully plain - speaking young lady continued presently .
Parsing [sent. 2131 len. 20]: `` On the line at next spring 's Salon , then packed up for the dear ones at home .
Parsing [sent. 2132 len. 22]: I 'd as soon own an ` Art Bronze , ' myself -- or a nice , clean porcelain Arab . ''
Parsing [sent. 2133 len. 23]: `` No doubt you 've forgotten for the moment , '' I said , `` that Mr. Ward is my friend . ''
Parsing [sent. 2134 len. 47]: `` Not in painting , he is n't , '' she returned quickly , `` I consider his work altogether creditable ; it 's carefully done , conscientious , effective -- '' `` Is n't that true of the ladies in the hairdressers ' windows ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2135 len. 6]: she asked with assumed artlessness .
Parsing [sent. 2136 len. 20]: `` Ca n't you say a kind word for them , good gentleman , and heaven bless you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2137 len. 13]: `` Why sha 'n' t I be asked to Quesnay again ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2138 len. 3]: She laughed .
Parsing [sent. 2139 len. 30]: `` You have n't seemed FANATICALLY appreciative of your opportunities when you have been there ; you might have carried her off from Cresson Ingle instead of vice versa .
Parsing [sent. 2140 len. 41]: But after all , you ARE N'T '' -- here she paused and looked at me appraisingly for a moment - `` you ARE N'T the most piratical dash-in-and-dash-out and leave-everything-upside - down-behind-you sort of man , are you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2141 len. 10]: `` No , I believe I 'm not . ''
Parsing [sent. 2142 len. 19]: `` However , that 's only a SMALL half of the reason , '' Miss Elliott went on .
Parsing [sent. 2143 len. 10]: `` She 's furious on account of this . ''
Parsing [sent. 2144 len. 10]: These were vague words , and I said so .
Parsing [sent. 2145 len. 19]: `` Oh , THIS , '' she explained , `` my being here ; your letting me come .
Parsing [sent. 2146 len. 7]: Impropriety -- all of that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2147 len. 8]: A sharp whistle issued from her lips .
Parsing [sent. 2148 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 2149 len. 12]: the EXCORIATING things she 's said of my pursuing you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2150 len. 36]: `` But does n't she know that it 's only part of your siege of Madame Brossard 's ; that it 's a subterfuge in the hope of catching a glimpse of Oliver Saffren ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2151 len. 4]: `` No ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2152 len. 34]: she cried , her eyes dancing ; `` I told her that , but she thinks it 's only a subterfuge in the hope of catching more than a glimpse of you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2153 len. 7]: I joined laughter with her then .
Parsing [sent. 2154 len. 29]: She was the first to stop , and , looking at me somewhat doubtfully , she said : `` Whereas , the truth is that it 's neither .
Parsing [sent. 2155 len. 11]: You know very well that I want to paint . ''
Parsing [sent. 2156 len. 9]: `` Certainly , '' I agreed at once .
Parsing [sent. 2157 len. 43]: `` Your devotion to ` your art ' and your hope of spending half an hour at Madame Brossard 's now and then are separable ; -- which reminds me : Would n't you like me to look at your sketch ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2158 len. 7]: `` No , not yet . ''
Parsing [sent. 2159 len. 11]: She jumped up and brought her camp-stool over to mine .
Parsing [sent. 2160 len. 21]: `` I feel that I could better bear what you 'll say of it after I 've had some lunch .
Parsing [sent. 2161 len. 15]: Not a SYLLABLE of food has crossed my lips since coffee at dawn ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2162 len. 90]: I spread before her what Amedee had prepared ; not sandwiches for the pocket to-day , but a wicker hamper , one end of which we let rest upon her knees , the other upon mine , and at sight of the foie gras , the delicate , devilled partridge , the truffled salad , the fine yellow cheese , and the long bottle of good red Beaune , revealed when the cover was off , I could almost have forgiven the old rascal for his scandal - mongering .
Parsing [sent. 2163 len. 14]: As for my vis-a-vis , she pronounced it a `` maddening sight . ''
Parsing [sent. 2164 len. 28]: `` Fall to , my merry man , '' she added , `` and eat your fill of this fair pasty , under the greenwood tree . ''
Parsing [sent. 2165 len. 35]: Obeying her instructions with right good-will , and the lady likewise evincing no hatred of the viands , we made a cheerful meal of it , topping it with peaches and bunches of grapes .
Parsing [sent. 2166 len. 26]: `` It is unfair to let you do all the catering , '' said Miss Elliott , after carefully selecting the largest and best peach .
Parsing [sent. 2167 len. 23]: `` Jean Ferret 's friend does that , '' I returned , watching her rather intently as she dexterously peeled the peach .
Parsing [sent. 2168 len. 26]: She did it very daintily , I had to admit that -- though I regretted to observe indications of the gourmet in one so young .
Parsing [sent. 2169 len. 27]: But when it was peeled clean , she set it on a fresh green leaf , and , to my surprise , gave it to me .
Parsing [sent. 2170 len. 32]: `` You see , '' she continued , not observing my remorseful confusion , `` I could n't destroy Elizabeth 's peace of mind and then raid her larder to boot .
Parsing [sent. 2171 len. 4]: That poor lady !
Parsing [sent. 2172 len. 30]: I make her trouble enough , but it 's nothing to what she 's going to have when she finds out some things that she must find out . ''
Parsing [sent. 2173 len. 6]: `` What is that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2174 len. 11]: `` About Mrs. Harman , '' was the serious reply .
Parsing [sent. 2175 len. 9]: `` Elizabeth has n't a clue . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 2176 len. 5]: ` Clue ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2177 len. 3]: I echoed .
Parsing [sent. 2178 len. 8]: `` To Louise 's strange affair . ''
Parsing [sent. 2179 len. 12]: Miss Elliott 's expression had grown as serious as her tone .
Parsing [sent. 2180 len. 13]: `` It is strange ; the strangest thing I ever knew . ''
Parsing [sent. 2181 len. 12]: `` But there 's your own case , '' I urged .
Parsing [sent. 2182 len. 17]: `` Why should you think it strange of her to take an interest in Saffren ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2183 len. 12]: `` I adore him , of course , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 2184 len. 35]: `` He is the most glorious-looking person I 've ever seen , but on my WORD -- '' She paused , and as her gaze met mine I saw real earnestness in her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2185 len. 30]: `` I 'm afraid -- I was half joking the other day -- but now I 'm really afraid Louise is beginning to be in love with him . ''
Parsing [sent. 2186 len. 14]: `` Oh , might n't it be only interest , so far ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2187 len. 3]: I said .
Parsing [sent. 2188 len. 8]: `` No , it 's much more .
Parsing [sent. 2189 len. 10]: And I 've grown so fond of her ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2190 len. 12]: the girl went on , her voice unexpectedly verging upon tremulousness .
Parsing [sent. 2191 len. 53]: `` She 's quite wonderful in her way -- such an understanding sort of woman , and generous and kind ; there are so many things turning up in a party like ours at Quesnay that show what people are really made of , and she 's a rare , fine spirit .
Parsing [sent. 2192 len. 20]: It seems a pity , with such a miserable first experience as she had , that this should happen .
Parsing [sent. 2193 len. 17]: Oh I know , '' she continued rapidly , cutting off a half-formed protest of mine .
Parsing [sent. 2194 len. 25]: `` He is n't mad -- and I 'm sorry I tried to be amusing about it the night you dined at the chateau .
Parsing [sent. 2195 len. 31]: I know perfectly well he 's not insane ; but I 'm absolutely sure , from one thing and another , that -- well -- he is n't ALL THERE !
Parsing [sent. 2196 len. 34]: He 's as beautiful as a seraph and probably as good as one , but something is MISSING about him -- and it begins to look like a second tragedy for her . ''
Parsing [sent. 2197 len. 11]: `` You mean , she really -- '' I began .
Parsing [sent. 2198 len. 17]: `` Yes , I do , '' she returned , with a catch in her throat .
Parsing [sent. 2199 len. 12]: `` She conies to my room when the others are asleep .
Parsing [sent. 2200 len. 72]: Not that she tells me a great deal , but it 's in the air , somehow ; she told me with such a strained sort of gaiety of their meeting and his first joining her ; and there was something underneath as if she thought _ I _ might be really serious in my ravings about him , and -- yes , as if she meant to warn me off .
Parsing [sent. 2201 len. 57]: And the other night , when I saw her after their lunching together at Dives , I asked her teasingly if she 'd had a happy day , and she laughed the prettiest laugh I ever heard and put her arms around me -- then suddenly broke out crying and ran out of the room . ''
Parsing [sent. 2202 len. 17]: `` But that may have been no more than over-strained nerves , '' I feebly suggested .
Parsing [sent. 2203 len. 7]: `` Of course it was ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2204 len. 9]: she cried , regarding me with justifiable astonishment .
Parsing [sent. 2205 len. 13]: `` It 's the CAUSE of their being overstrained that interests me !
Parsing [sent. 2206 len. 26]: It 's all so strange and distressing , '' she continued more gently , `` that I wish I were n't there to see it .
Parsing [sent. 2207 len. 10]: And there 's poor George Ward coming -- ah !
Parsing [sent. 2208 len. 8]: and when Elizabeth learns of it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2209 len. 18]: `` Mrs. Harman had her way once , in spite of everything , '' I said thoughtfully .
Parsing [sent. 2210 len. 13]: `` Yes , she was a headstrong girl of nineteen , then .
Parsing [sent. 2211 len. 13]: But let 's not think it could go as far as that !
Parsing [sent. 2212 len. 3]: There ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2213 len. 12]: She threw a peach-stone over her shoulder and sprang up gaily .
Parsing [sent. 2214 len. 14]: `` Let 's not talk of it ; I THINK of it enough !
Parsing [sent. 2215 len. 18]: It 's time for you to give me a RACKING criticism on my morning 's work . ''
Parsing [sent. 2216 len. 36]: Taking off her coat as she spoke , she unbuttoned the cuffs of her manly blouse and rolled up her sleeves as far as they would go , preparations which I observed with some perplexity .
Parsing [sent. 2217 len. 33]: `` If you intend any violence , '' said I , `` in case my views of your work should n't meet your own , I think I 'll be leaving . ''
Parsing [sent. 2218 len. 43]: `` Wait , '' she responded , and kneeling upon one knee beside a bush near by , thrust her arms elbow-deep under the outer mantle of leaves , shaking the stems vigorously , and sending down a shower of sparkling drops .
Parsing [sent. 2219 len. 47]: Never lived sane man , or madman , since time began , who , seeing her then , could or would have denied that she made the very prettiest picture ever seen by any person or persons whatsoever -- but her purpose was difficult to fathom .
Parsing [sent. 2220 len. 17]: Pursuing it , I remarked that it was improbable that birds would be nesting so low .
Parsing [sent. 2221 len. 13]: `` It 's for a finger bowl , '' she said briskly .
Parsing [sent. 2222 len. 20]: And rising , this most practical of her sex dried her hands upon a fresh serviette from the hamper .
Parsing [sent. 2223 len. 14]: `` Last night 's rain is worth two birds in the bush . ''
Parsing [sent. 2224 len. 20]: With that , she readjusted her sleeves , lightly donned her coat , and preceded me to her easel .
Parsing [sent. 2225 len. 10]: `` Now , '' she commanded , `` slaughter !
Parsing [sent. 2226 len. 12]: It 's what I let you come with me for . ''
Parsing [sent. 2227 len. 30]: I looked at her sketch with much more attention than I had given the small board she had used as a bait in the courtyard of Les Trois Pigeons .
Parsing [sent. 2228 len. 39]: Today she showed a larger ambition , and a larger canvas as well -- or , perhaps I should say a larger burlap , for she had chosen to paint upon something strongly resembling a square of coffee-sacking .
Parsing [sent. 2229 len. 42]: But there was no doubt she had `` found colour '' in a swash-buckling , bullying style of forcing it to be there , whether it was or not , and to `` vibrate , '' whether it did or not .
Parsing [sent. 2230 len. 47]: There was not much to be said , for the violent kind of thing she had done always hushes me ; and even when it is well done I am never sure whether its right place is the `` Salon des Independants '' or the Luxembourg .
Parsing [sent. 2231 len. 39]: It SEEMS dreadful , and yet sometimes I fear in secret that it may be a real transition , or even an awakening , and that the men I began with , and I , are standing still .
Parsing [sent. 2232 len. 24]: The older men called US lunatics once , and the critics said we were `` daring , '' but that was long ago .
Parsing [sent. 2233 len. 4]: `` Well ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2234 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 2235 len. 62]: I had to speak , so I paraphrased a mot of Degas -LRB- I think it was Degas -RRB- and said : `` If Rousseau could come to life and see this sketch of yours , I imagine he would be very much interested , but if he saw mine he might say , ` That is my fault ! ' ''
Parsing [sent. 2236 len. 4]: `` OH ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2237 len. 20]: she cried , her colour rising quickly ; she looked troubled for a second , then her eyes twinkled .
Parsing [sent. 2238 len. 19]: `` You 're not going to let my work make a difference between us , are you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2239 len. 57]: `` I 'll even try to look at it from your own point of view , '' I answered , stepping back several yards to see it better , though I should have had to retire about a quarter of the length of a city block to see it quite from her own point of view .
Parsing [sent. 2240 len. 11]: She moved with me , both of us walking backward .
Parsing [sent. 2241 len. 45]: I began : `` For a day like this , with all the colour in the trees themselves and so very little in the air -- '' There came an interruption , a voice of unpleasant and wiry nasality , speaking from behind us .
Parsing [sent. 2242 len. 6]: `` WELL , WELL ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2243 len. 3]: it said .
Parsing [sent. 2244 len. 8]: `` So here we are again ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2245 len. 52]: I faced about and beheld , just emerged from a by-path , a fox-faced young man whose light , well-poised figure was jauntily clad in gray serge , with scarlet waistcoat and tie , white shoes upon his feet , and a white hat , gaily beribboned , upon his head .
Parsing [sent. 2246 len. 22]: A recollection of the dusky road and a group of people about Pere Baudry 's lamplit door flickered across my mind .
Parsing [sent. 2247 len. 6]: `` The historical tourist ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2248 len. 3]: I exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 2249 len. 9]: `` The highly pedestrian tripper from Trouville ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2250 len. 28]: `` You got me right , m ` dear friend , '' he replied with condescension ; `` I rec ` leck meetin ' you perfect . ''
Parsing [sent. 2251 len. 34]: `` And I was interested to learn , '' said I , carefully observing the effect of my words upon him , `` that you had been to Les Trois Pigeons after all .
Parsing [sent. 2252 len. 32]: Perhaps I might put it , you had been through Les Trois Pigeons , for the maitre d'hotel informed me you had investigated every corner -- that was n't locked . ''
Parsing [sent. 2253 len. 23]: `` Sure , '' he returned , with rather less embarrassment than a brazen Vishnu would have exhibited under the same circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 2254 len. 12]: `` He showed me what pitchers they was in your studio .
Parsing [sent. 2255 len. 13]: I 'll luk 'em over again fer ye one of these days .
Parsing [sent. 2256 len. 8]: Some of 'em was right gud . ''
Parsing [sent. 2257 len. 17]: `` You will be visiting near enough for me to avail myself of the opportunity ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2258 len. 11]: `` Right in the Pigeon House , m ` friend .
Parsing [sent. 2259 len. 19]: I 've just come down t ` putt in a few days there , '' he responded coolly .
Parsing [sent. 2260 len. 22]: `` They 's a young feller in this neighbourhood I take a kind o ' fam ` ly interest in . ''
Parsing [sent. 2261 len. 6]: `` Who is that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2262 len. 4]: I asked quickly .
Parsing [sent. 2263 len. 27]: For answer he produced the effect of a laugh by widening and lifting one side of his mouth , leaving the other , meantime , rigid .
Parsing [sent. 2264 len. 22]: `` Don ' lem me int ` rup ' the conv ` sation with yer lady-friend , '' he said winningly .
Parsing [sent. 2265 len. 15]: `` What they call ` talkin ' High Arts , ' was n't it ?
Parsing [sent. 2266 len. 8]: I 'd like to hear some . ''
Parsing [sent. 2267 len. 29]: CHAPTER XVI Miss Elliott 's expression , when I turned to observe the effect of the intruder upon her , was found to be one of brilliant delight .
Parsing [sent. 2268 len. 30]: With glowing eyes , her lips parted in a breathless ecstasy , she gazed upon the newcomer , evidently fearing to lose a syllable that fell from his lips .
Parsing [sent. 2269 len. 12]: Moving closer to me she whispered urgently : `` Keep him .
Parsing [sent. 2270 len. 6]: Oh , keep him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2271 len. 25]: To detain him , for a time at least , was my intention , though my motive was not merely to afford her pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 2272 len. 30]: The advent of the young man had produced a singularly disagreeable impression upon me , quite apart from any antagonism I might have felt toward him as a type .
Parsing [sent. 2273 len. 33]: Strange suspicions leaped into my mind , formless -- in the surprise of the moment -- but rapidly groping toward definite outline ; and following hard upon them crept a tingling apprehension .
Parsing [sent. 2274 len. 57]: The reappearance of this rattish youth , casual as was the air with which he strove to invest it , began to assume , for me , the character of a theatrical entrance of unpleasant portent -- a suggestion just now enhanced by an absurdly obvious notion of his own that he was enacting a part .
Parsing [sent. 2275 len. 72]: This was written all over him , most legibly in his attitude of the knowing amateur , as he surveyed Miss Elliott 's painting patronisingly , his head on one side , his cane in the crook of his elbows behind his back , and his body teetering genteelly as he shifted his weight from his toes to his heels and back again , nodding meanwhile a slight but judicial approbation .
Parsing [sent. 2276 len. 29]: `` Now , about how much , '' he said slowly , `` would you expec ' t ' git f ' r a pitcher that size ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2277 len. 11]: `` It is n't mine , '' I informed him .
Parsing [sent. 2278 len. 16]: `` You do n't tell me it 's the little lady 's -- what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2279 len. 14]: He bowed genially and favoured Miss Elliott with a stare of warm admiration .
Parsing [sent. 2280 len. 13]: `` Pretty a thing as I ever see , '' he added .
Parsing [sent. 2281 len. 14]: `` Oh , '' she cried with an ardour that choked her slightly .
Parsing [sent. 2282 len. 5]: `` THANK you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2283 len. 9]: `` Oh , I meant the PITCHER ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2284 len. 12]: he said hastily , evidently nonplussed by a gratitude so fervent .
Parsing [sent. 2285 len. 10]: The incorrigible damsel cast down her eyes in modesty .
Parsing [sent. 2286 len. 16]: `` And I had hoped , '' she breathed , `` something so different ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2287 len. 18]: I could not be certain whether or not he caught the whisper ; I thought he did .
Parsing [sent. 2288 len. 60]: At all events , the surface of his easy assurance appeared somewhat disarranged ; and , perhaps to restore it by performing the rites of etiquette , he said : `` Well , I expec ' the smart thing now is to pass the cards , but mine 's in my grip an ' it ai n't unpacked yet .
Parsing [sent. 2289 len. 12]: The name you 'd see on 'em is Oil Poicy . ''
Parsing [sent. 2290 len. 16]: `` Oil Poicy , '' echoed Miss Elliott , turning to me in genuine astonishment .
Parsing [sent. 2291 len. 9]: `` Mr. Earl Percy , '' I translated .
Parsing [sent. 2292 len. 6]: `` Oh , RAPTUROUS ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2293 len. 7]: she cried , her face radiant .
Parsing [sent. 2294 len. 15]: `` And WO N'T Mr. Percy give us his opinion of my Art ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2295 len. 91]: Mr. Percy was in doubt how to take her enthusiasm ; he seemed on the point of turning surly , and hesitated , while a sharp vertical line appeared on his small forehead ; but he evidently concluded , after a deep glance at her , that if she was making game of him it was in no ill - natured spirit -- nay , I think that for a few moments he suspected her liveliness to be some method of her own for the incipient stages of a flirtation .
Parsing [sent. 2296 len. 24]: Finally he turned again to the easel , and as he examined the painting thereon at closer range , amazement overspread his features .
Parsing [sent. 2297 len. 41]: However , pulling himself together , he found himself able to reply -- and with great gallantry : `` Well , on ' y t ' think them little hands cud ` a ' done all that rough woik ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2298 len. 27]: The unintended viciousness of this retort produced an effect so marked , that , except for my growing uneasiness , I might have enjoyed her expression .
Parsing [sent. 2299 len. 34]: As it was , I saved her face by entering into the conversation with a question , which I put quickly : `` You intend pursuing your historical researches in the neighborhood ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2300 len. 62]: The facial contortion which served him for a laugh , and at the same time as a symbol of unfathomable reserve , was repeated , accompanied by a jocose manifestation , in the nature of a sharp and taunting cackle , which seemed to indicate a conviction that he was getting much the best of it in some conflict of wits .
Parsing [sent. 2301 len. 34]: `` Them fairy tales I handed you about ole Jeanne d'Arc and William the Conker , '' he said , `` say , they must ` a ' made you sore after-WOIDS ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2302 len. 31]: `` On the contrary , I was much interested in everything pertaining to your too brief visit , '' I returned ; `` I am even more so now . ''
Parsing [sent. 2303 len. 24]: `` Well , m ` friend '' -- he shot me a sidelong , distrustful glance -- `` keep yer eyes open . ''
Parsing [sent. 2304 len. 8]: `` That is just the point ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2305 len. 21]: I laughed , with intentional significance , for I meant to make Mr. Percy talk as much as I could .
Parsing [sent. 2306 len. 33]: To this end , remembering that specimens of his kind are most indiscreet when carefully enraged , I added , simulating his own manner : `` Eyes open -- and doors locked !
Parsing [sent. 2307 len. 3]: What ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2308 len. 27]: At this I heard a gasp of astonishment from Miss Elliott , who must have been puzzled indeed ; but I was intent upon the other .
Parsing [sent. 2309 len. 8]: He proved perfectly capable of being insulted .
Parsing [sent. 2310 len. 34]: `` I guess they ai n't much need o ' lockin ' YOUR door , '' he retorted darkly ; `` not from what I saw when I was in your studio ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2311 len. 22]: He should have stopped there , for the hit was palpable and justified ; but in his resentment he overdid it .
Parsing [sent. 2312 len. 18]: `` You need n't be scared of anybody 's cartin ' off THEM pitchers , young feller !
Parsing [sent. 2313 len. 2]: WHOOSH !
Parsing [sent. 2314 len. 50]: An ' f 'm the luks of the CLO'ES I saw hangin ' on the wall , '' he continued , growing more nettled as I smiled cheerfully upon him , `` I don ' b ` lieve you gut any worries comin ' about THEM , neither ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2315 len. 17]: `` I suppose our tastes are different , '' I said , letting my smile broaden .
Parsing [sent. 2316 len. 9]: `` There might be protection in that . ''
Parsing [sent. 2317 len. 60]: His stare at me was protracted to an unseemly length before the sting of this remark reached him ; it penetrated finally , however , and in his sharp change of posture there was a lightning flicker of the experienced boxer ; but he checked the impulse , and took up the task of obliterating me in another way .
Parsing [sent. 2318 len. 43]: `` As I tell the little dame here , '' he said , pitching his voice higher and affecting the plaintive , `` I make no passes at a friend o ' her -- not in front o ' her , anyways .
Parsing [sent. 2319 len. 45]: But when it comes to these here ole , ancient curiosities '' -- he cackled again , loudly -- `` well , I guess them clo'es I see , that day , kin hand it out t ' anything they got in the museums !
Parsing [sent. 2320 len. 29]: ` Look here , ' I says to the waiter , ` THESE must be 'n left over f 'm ole Jeanne d'Arc herself , ' I says .
Parsing [sent. 2321 len. 10]: ` Talk about yer relics , ' I says .
Parsing [sent. 2322 len. 2]: Whoosh !
Parsing [sent. 2323 len. 8]: I 'd like t ' died ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2324 len. 18]: He laughed violently , and concluded by turning upon me with a contemptuous flourish of his stick .
Parsing [sent. 2325 len. 12]: `` You think I d'know what makes YOU so raw ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2326 len. 50]: The form of repartee necessary to augment his ill humour was , of course , a matter of simple mechanism for one who had not entirely forgotten his student days in the Quarter ; and I delivered it airily , though I shivered inwardly that Miss Elliott should hear .
Parsing [sent. 2327 len. 25]: `` Everything will be all right if , when you dine at the inn , you 'll sit with your back toward me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2328 len. 33]: To my shamed surprise , this roustabout wit drew a nervous , silvery giggle from her ; and that completed the work with Mr. Percy , whose face grew scarlet with anger .
Parsing [sent. 2329 len. 11]: `` You 're a hot one , you are ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2330 len. 7]: he sneered , with shocking bitterness .
Parsing [sent. 2331 len. 22]: `` You 're quite the teaser , ai n't ye , s ` long 's yer lady-friend is lukkin ' on !
Parsing [sent. 2332 len. 16]: I guess they 'll be a few surprises comin ' YOUR way , before long .
Parsing [sent. 2333 len. 17]: P'raps I cud n't give ye one now ' f I had a mind to . ''
Parsing [sent. 2334 len. 23]: `` Pshaw , '' I laughed , and , venturing at hazard , said , `` I know all YOU know ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2335 len. 7]: `` Oh , you do ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2336 len. 4]: he cried scornfully .
Parsing [sent. 2337 len. 28]: `` I reckon you might set up an ' take a little notice , though , if you knowed ` at I know all YOU know ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2338 len. 8]: `` Not a bit of it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2339 len. 3]: `` No ?
Parsing [sent. 2340 len. 15]: Maybe you think I do n't know what makes you so raw with ME ?
Parsing [sent. 2341 len. 33]: Maybe you think I do n't know who ye 've got so thick with at this here Pigeon House ; maybe you think I do n't know who them people ARE ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2342 len. 7]: `` No , you do n't .
Parsing [sent. 2343 len. 17]: You have learned , '' I said , trying to control my excitement , `` nothing !
Parsing [sent. 2344 len. 10]: Whoever hired YOU for a spy lost the money .
Parsing [sent. 2345 len. 7]: YOU do n't know ANY-thing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2346 len. 6]: `` I DO N'T ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2347 len. 10]: And with that his voice went to a half-shriek .
Parsing [sent. 2348 len. 80]: `` Maybe you think I 'm down here f ' r my health ; maybe you think I come out f ' r a pleasant walk in the woods right now ; maybe you think I ai n't seen no other lady-friend o ' yours besides this 'n to-day , and maybe I did n't see who was with her -- yes , an ' maybe you think I d'know no other times he 's be 'n with her .
Parsing [sent. 2349 len. 15]: Maybe you think I ai n't be 'n layin ' low over at Dives !
Parsing [sent. 2350 len. 13]: Maybe I do n't know a few real NAMES in this neighbourhood !
Parsing [sent. 2351 len. 8]: Oh , no , MAYBE not ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2352 len. 14]: `` You know what the maitre d'hotel told you ; nothing more . ''
Parsing [sent. 2353 len. 10]: `` How about the name -- OLIVER SAFFREN ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2354 len. 20]: he cried fiercely , and at last , though I had expected it , I uttered an involuntary exclamation .
Parsing [sent. 2355 len. 6]: `` How about it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2356 len. 15]: he shouted , advancing toward me triumphantly , shaking his forefinger in my face .
Parsing [sent. 2357 len. 3]: `` Hey ?
Parsing [sent. 2358 len. 7]: THAT stings some , does it ?
Parsing [sent. 2359 len. 12]: Sounds kind o ' like a FALSE name , does it ?
Parsing [sent. 2360 len. 16]: Got ye where the hair is short , that time , did n't I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2361 len. 25]: `` Speaking of names , '' I retorted , '' ` Oil Poicy ' does n't seem to ring particularly true to me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2362 len. 17]: `` It 'll be gud enough fer you , young feller , '' he responded angrily .
Parsing [sent. 2363 len. 18]: `` It may belong t ' me , an ' then again , it maybe do n't .
Parsing [sent. 2364 len. 19]: It ain ' gunna git me in no trouble ; I 'll luk out f ' r that .
Parsing [sent. 2365 len. 17]: YOUR side 's where the trouble is ; that 's what 's eatin ' into you .
Parsing [sent. 2366 len. 37]: An ' I 'll tell you flat-foot , your gittin ' rough ` ith me and playin ' Charley the Show-Off in front o ' yer lady - friends 'll all go down in the bill .
Parsing [sent. 2367 len. 29]: These people ye 've got so chummy with -- THEY 'LL pay f ' r it all right , do n't you shed no tears over that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2368 len. 48]: `` You could n't by any possibility , '' I said deliberately , with as much satire as I could command , `` you could n't possibly mean that any sum of mere money might be a salve for the injuries my unkind words have inflicted ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2369 len. 22]: Once more he seemed upon the point of destroying me physically , but , with a slight shudder , controlled himself .
Parsing [sent. 2370 len. 67]: Stepping close to me , he thrust his head forward and measured the emphases of his speech by his right forefinger upon my shoulder , as he said : `` You paint THIS in yer pitchers , m ' dear friend ; they 's jest as much law in this country as they is on the corner o ' Twenty-thoid Street an ' Fif ' Avenoo !
Parsing [sent. 2371 len. 16]: You keep out the way of it , or you 'll git runned over ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2372 len. 52]: Delivering a final tap on my shoulder as a last warning , he wheeled deftly upon his heel , addressed Miss Elliott briefly , `` Glad t ' know YOU , lady , '' and striking into the by-path by which he had approached us , was soon lost to sight .
Parsing [sent. 2373 len. 6]: The girl faced me excitedly .
Parsing [sent. 2374 len. 6]: `` What IS it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2375 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 2376 len. 16]: `` It seemed to me you insulted him deliberately -- '' `` I did . ''
Parsing [sent. 2377 len. 9]: `` You wanted to make him angry ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2378 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 2379 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 2380 len. 5]: I thought so ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2381 len. 4]: she exclaimed breathlessly .
Parsing [sent. 2382 len. 9]: `` I knew there was something serious underneath .
Parsing [sent. 2383 len. 7]: It 's about Mr. Saffren ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2384 len. 27]: `` It is serious indeed , I fear , '' I said , and turning to my own easel , began to get my traps together .
Parsing [sent. 2385 len. 45]: `` I 'll tell you the little I know , because I want you to tell Mrs. Harman what has just happened , and you 'll be able to do it better if you understand what is understandable about the rest of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2386 len. 17]: `` You mean you would n't tell me so that I could understand for myself ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2387 len. 12]: There was a note of genuine grieved reproach in her voice .
Parsing [sent. 2388 len. 15]: `` Ah , then I 've made you think me altogether a hare-brain ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2389 len. 30]: `` I have n't time to tell you what I think of you , '' I said brusquely , and , strangely enough , it seemed to please her .
Parsing [sent. 2390 len. 78]: But I paid little attention to that , continuing quickly : `` When Professor Keredec and Mr. Saffren came to Les Trois Pigeons , they were so careful to keep out of everybody 's sight that one might have suspected that they were in hiding -- and , in fact , I 'm sure that they were -- though , as time passed and nothing alarming happened , they 've felt reassured and allowed themselves more liberty .
Parsing [sent. 2391 len. 74]: It struck me that Keredec at first dreaded that they might be traced to the inn , and I 'm afraid his fear was justified , for one night , before I came to know them , I met Mr. ` Percy ' on the road ; he 'd visited Madame Brossard 's and pumped Amedee dry , but clumsily tried to pretend to me that he had not been there at all .
Parsing [sent. 2392 len. 17]: At the time , I did not connect him even remotely with Professor Keredec 's anxieties .
Parsing [sent. 2393 len. 32]: I imagined he might have an eye to the spoons ; but it 's as ridiculous to think him a burglar as it would be to take him for a detective .
Parsing [sent. 2394 len. 58]: What he is , or what he has to do with Mr. Saffren , I can guess no more than I can guess the cause of Keredec 's fears , but the moment I saw him to-day , saw that he 'd come back , I knew it was THAT , and tried to draw him out .
Parsing [sent. 2395 len. 19]: You heard what he said ; there 's no doubt that Saffren stands in danger of some kind .
Parsing [sent. 2396 len. 31]: It may be inconsiderable , or even absurd , but it 's evidently imminent , and no matter what it is , Mrs. Harman must be kept out of it .
Parsing [sent. 2397 len. 33]: I want you to see her as soon as you can and ask her from me -- no , persuade her yourself -- not to leave Quesnay for a day or two .
Parsing [sent. 2398 len. 20]: I mean , that she absolutely MUST NOT meet Mr. Saffren again until we know what all this means .
Parsing [sent. 2399 len. 6]: Will you do it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2400 len. 6]: `` That I will ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2401 len. 12]: And she began hastily to get her belongings in marching order .
Parsing [sent. 2402 len. 31]: `` I 'll do anything in the world you 'll let me -- and oh , I hope they ca n't do anything to poor , poor Mr. Saffren ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2403 len. 17]: `` Our sporting friend had evidently seen him with Mrs. Harman to-day , '' I said .
Parsing [sent. 2404 len. 13]: `` Do you know if they went to the beach again ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2405 len. 24]: `` I only know she meant to meet him -- but she told me she 'd be back at the chateau by four .
Parsing [sent. 2406 len. 21]: If I start now -- '' `` Was n't the phaeton to be sent to the inn for you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2407 len. 22]: `` Not until six , '' she returned briskly , folding her easel and strapping it to her camp-stool with precision .
Parsing [sent. 2408 len. 10]: `` Is n't it shorter by the woods ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2409 len. 23]: `` You 've only to follow this path to the second crossing and then turn to the right , '' I responded .
Parsing [sent. 2410 len. 61]: `` I shall hurry back to Madame Brossard 's to see Keredec -- and here '' -- I extended my hand toward her traps , of which , in a neatly practical fashion , she had made one close pack -- `` let me have your things , and I 'll take care of them at the inn for you .
Parsing [sent. 2411 len. 12]: They 're heavy , and it 's a long trudge . ''
Parsing [sent. 2412 len. 19]: `` You have your own to carry , '' she answered , swinging the strap over her shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 2413 len. 13]: `` It 's something of a walk for you , too . ''
Parsing [sent. 2414 len. 32]: `` No , no , let me have them , '' I protested , for the walk before her WAS long and the things would be heavy indeed before it ended .
Parsing [sent. 2415 len. 31]: `` Go your ways , '' she laughed , and as my hand still remained extended she grasped it with her own and gave it a warm and friendly shake .
Parsing [sent. 2416 len. 4]: `` Hurry ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2417 len. 24]: And with an optimism which took my breath , she said , `` I know YOU can make it come out all right !
Parsing [sent. 2418 len. 8]: Besides , I 'll help you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2419 len. 11]: With that she turned and started manfully upon her journey .
Parsing [sent. 2420 len. 37]: I stared after her for a moment or more , watching the pretty brown dress flashing in and out of shadow among the ragged greeneries , shafts of sunshine now and then flashing upon her hair .
Parsing [sent. 2421 len. 14]: Then I picked up my own pack and set out for the inn .
Parsing [sent. 2422 len. 32]: Every one knows that the more serious and urgent the errand a man may be upon , the more incongruous are apt to be the thoughts that skip into his mind .
Parsing [sent. 2423 len. 34]: As I went through the woods that day , breathless with haste and curious fears , my brain became suddenly , unaccountably busy with a dream I had had , two nights before .
Parsing [sent. 2424 len. 22]: I had not recalled this dream on waking : the recollection of it came to me now for the first time .
Parsing [sent. 2425 len. 41]: It was a usual enough dream , wandering and unlifelike , not worth the telling ; and I had been thinking so constantly of Mrs. Harman that there was nothing extraordinary in her worthless ex-husband 's being part of it .
Parsing [sent. 2426 len. 61]: And yet , looking back upon that last , hurried walk of mine through the forest , I see how strange it was that I could not quit remembering how in my dream I had gone motoring up Mount Pilatus with the man I had seen so pitiably demolished on the Versailles road , two years before -- Larrabee Harman .
Parsing [sent. 2427 len. 72]: CHAPTER XVII Keredec was alone in his salon , extended at ease upon a long chair , an ottoman and a stool , when I burst in upon him ; a portentous volume was in his lap , and a prolific pipe , smoking up from his great cloud of beard , gave the final reality to the likeness he thus presented of a range of hills ending in a volcano .
Parsing [sent. 2428 len. 25]: But he rolled the book cavalierly to the floor , limbered up by sections to receive me , and offered me a hearty welcome .
Parsing [sent. 2429 len. 26]: `` Ha , my dear sir , '' he cried , `` you take pity on the lonely Keredec ; you make him a visit .
Parsing [sent. 2430 len. 8]: I could not wish better for myself .
Parsing [sent. 2431 len. 12]: We shall have a good smoke and a good talk . ''
Parsing [sent. 2432 len. 7]: `` You are improved to-day ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2433 len. 10]: I asked , it may be a little slyly .
Parsing [sent. 2434 len. 4]: `` Improve ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2435 len. 4]: he repeated inquiringly .
Parsing [sent. 2436 len. 8]: `` Your rheumatism , I mean . ''
Parsing [sent. 2437 len. 9]: `` Ha , yes ; that rheumatism ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2438 len. 16]: he shouted , and throwing back his head , rocked the room with sudden laughter .
Parsing [sent. 2439 len. 3]: `` Hew !
Parsing [sent. 2440 len. 7]: But it is gone -- almost !
Parsing [sent. 2441 len. 24]: Oh , I am much better , and soon I shall be able to go in the woods again with my boy . ''
Parsing [sent. 2442 len. 7]: He pushed a chair toward me .
Parsing [sent. 2443 len. 29]: `` Come , light your cigar ; he will not return for an hour perhaps , and there is plenty of time for the smoke to blow away .
Parsing [sent. 2444 len. 2]: So !
Parsing [sent. 2445 len. 4]: It is better .
Parsing [sent. 2446 len. 6]: Now we shall talk . ''
Parsing [sent. 2447 len. 16]: `` Yes , '' I said , `` I wanted to talk with you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2448 len. 9]: `` That is a -- what you call ?
Parsing [sent. 2449 len. 56]: -- ha , yes , a coincidence , '' he returned , stretching himself again in the long chair , `` a happy coincidence ; for I have wished a talk with you ; but you are away so early for all day , and in the evening Oliver , he is always here . ''
Parsing [sent. 2450 len. 14]: `` I think what I wanted to talk about concerns him particularly . ''
Parsing [sent. 2451 len. 4]: `` Yes ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2452 len. 10]: The professor leaned forward , looking at me gravely .
Parsing [sent. 2453 len. 6]: `` That is another coincidence .
Parsing [sent. 2454 len. 6]: But you shall speak first .
Parsing [sent. 2455 len. 4]: Commence then . ''
Parsing [sent. 2456 len. 66]: `` I feel that you know me at least well enough , '' I began rather hesitatingly , `` to be sure that I would not , for the world , make any effort to intrude in your affairs , or Mr. Saffren 's , and that I would not force your confidence in the remotest -- '' `` No , no , no ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2457 len. 3]: he interrupted .
Parsing [sent. 2458 len. 13]: `` Please do not fear I shall misinterpretate whatever you will say .
Parsing [sent. 2459 len. 5]: You are our friend .
Parsing [sent. 2460 len. 5]: We know it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2461 len. 18]: `` Very well , '' I pursued ; `` then I speak with no fear of offending .
Parsing [sent. 2462 len. 74]: When you first came to the inn I could n't help seeing that you took a great many precautions for secrecy ; and when you afterward explained these precautions to me on the ground that you feared somebody might think Mr. Saffren not quite sane , and that such an impression might injure him later -- well , I could not help seeing that your explanation did not cover all the ground . ''
Parsing [sent. 2463 len. 10]: `` It is true -- it did not . ''
Parsing [sent. 2464 len. 20]: He ran his huge hand through the heavy white waves of his hair , and shook his head vigorously .
Parsing [sent. 2465 len. 16]: `` No ; I knew it , my dear sir , I knew it well .
Parsing [sent. 2466 len. 7]: But , what could I do ?
Parsing [sent. 2467 len. 9]: I would not have telled my own mother !
Parsing [sent. 2468 len. 28]: This much I can say to you : we came here at a risk , but I thought that with great care it might be made little .
Parsing [sent. 2469 len. 37]: And I thought a great good thing might be accomplish if we should come here , something so fine , so wonderful , that even if the danger had been great I would have risked it .
Parsing [sent. 2470 len. 18]: I will tell you a little more : I think that great thing is BEING accomplish ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2471 len. 25]: Here he rose to his feet excitedly and began to pace the room as he talked , the ancient floor shaking with his tread .
Parsing [sent. 2472 len. 7]: `` I think it is DONE !
Parsing [sent. 2473 len. 3]: And ha !
Parsing [sent. 2474 len. 19]: my dear sir , if it SHOULD be , this big Keredec will not have lived in vain !
Parsing [sent. 2475 len. 23]: It was a great task I undertake with my young man , and the glory to see it finish is almost here .
Parsing [sent. 2476 len. 27]: Even if the danger should come , the THING is done , for all that is real and has true meaning is inside the soul ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2477 len. 50]: `` It was in connection with the risk you have mentioned that I came to talk , '' I returned with some emphasis , for I was convinced of the reality of Mr. Earl Percy and also very certain that he had no existence inside or outside a soul .
Parsing [sent. 2478 len. 17]: `` I think it necessary that you should know -- '' But the professor was launched .
Parsing [sent. 2479 len. 13]: I might as well have swept the rising tide with a broom .
Parsing [sent. 2480 len. 42]: He talked with magnificent vehemence for twenty minutes , his theme being some theory of his own that the individuality of a soul is immortal , and that even in perfection , the soul can not possibly merge into any Nirvana .
Parsing [sent. 2481 len. 34]: Meantime , I wondered how Mr. Percy was employing his time , but after one or two ineffectual attempts to interrupt , I gave myself to silence until the oration should be concluded .
Parsing [sent. 2482 len. 22]: `` And so it is with my boy , '' he proclaimed , coming at last to the case in hand .
Parsing [sent. 2483 len. 16]: `` The spirit of him , the real Oliver Saffren , THAT has NEVER change !
Parsing [sent. 2484 len. 31]: The outside of him , those thing that BELONG to him , like his memory , THEY have change , but not himself , for himself is eternal and unchangeable .
Parsing [sent. 2485 len. 34]: I have taught him , yes ; I have helped him get the small things we can add to our possession -- a little knowledge , maybe , a little power of judgment .
Parsing [sent. 2486 len. 19]: But , my dear sir , I tell you that such things are ONLY possessions of a man .
Parsing [sent. 2487 len. 6]: They are not the MAN !
Parsing [sent. 2488 len. 18]: All that a man IS or ever shall be , he is when he is a baby .
Parsing [sent. 2489 len. 22]: So with Oliver ; he had lived a little while , twenty-six years , perhaps , when pft -- like that !
Parsing [sent. 2490 len. 9]: -- he became almost as a baby again .
Parsing [sent. 2491 len. 12]: He could remember how to talk , but not much more .
Parsing [sent. 2492 len. 36]: He had lost his belongings -- they were gone from the lobe of the brain where he had stored them ; but HE was not gone , no part of the real HIMSELF was lacking .
Parsing [sent. 2493 len. 18]: Then presently they send him to me to make new his belongings , to restore his possessions .
Parsing [sent. 2494 len. 6]: Ha , what a task !
Parsing [sent. 2495 len. 26]: To take him with nothing in the world of his own and see that he get only GOOD possessions , GOOD knowledge , GOOD experience !
Parsing [sent. 2496 len. 30]: I took him to the mountains of the Tyrol -- two years -- and there his body became strong and splendid while his brain was taking in the stores .
Parsing [sent. 2497 len. 33]: It was quick , for his brain had retained some habits ; it was not a baby 's brain , and some small part of its old stores had not been lost .
Parsing [sent. 2498 len. 23]: But if anything useless or bad remain , we empty it out -- I and those mountain ' with their pure air .
Parsing [sent. 2499 len. 18]: Now , I say he is all good and the work was good ; I am proud !
Parsing [sent. 2500 len. 21]: But I wish to restore ALL that was good in his life ; your Keredec is something of a poet .
Parsing [sent. 2501 len. 11]: -- You may put it : much the old fool !
Parsing [sent. 2502 len. 22]: And for that greates ' restoration of all I have brought my boy back to France ; since it was necessary .
Parsing [sent. 2503 len. 19]: It was a madness , and I thank the good God I was mad enough to do it .
Parsing [sent. 2504 len. 29]: I can not tell you yet , my dear sir : but you shall see , you shall see what the folly of that old Keredec has done !
Parsing [sent. 2505 len. 31]: You shall see , you shall -- and I promise it -- what a Paradise , when the good God helps , an old fool 's dream can make ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2506 len. 28]: A half-light had broken upon me as he talked , pacing the floor , thundering his paean of triumph , his Titanic gestures bruising the harmless air .
Parsing [sent. 2507 len. 11]: Only one explanation , incredible , but possible , sufficed .
Parsing [sent. 2508 len. 31]: Anything was possible , I thought -- anything was probable -- with this dreamer whom the trump of Fame , executing a whimsical fantasia , proclaimed a man of science !
Parsing [sent. 2509 len. 61]: `` By the wildest chance , '' I gasped , `` you do n't mean that you wanted him to fall in love -- '' He had reached the other end of the room , but at this he whirled about on me , his laughter rolling out again , till it might have been heard at Pere Baudry 's .
Parsing [sent. 2510 len. 12]: `` Ha , my dear sir , you have said it !
Parsing [sent. 2511 len. 17]: But you knew it ; you told him to come to me and tell me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2512 len. 48]: `` But I mean that you -- unless I utterly misunderstand -- you seem to imply that you had selected some one now in France whom you planned that he should care for -- that you had selected the lady whom you know as Madame d'Armand . ''
Parsing [sent. 2513 len. 14]: `` Again , '' he shouted , `` you have said it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2514 len. 38]: `` Professor Keredec , '' I returned , with asperity , `` I have no idea how you came to conceive such a preposterous scheme , but I agree heartily that the word for it is madness .
Parsing [sent. 2515 len. 26]: In the first place , I must tell you that her name is not even d'Armand -- '' `` My dear sir , I know .
Parsing [sent. 2516 len. 9]: It was the mistake of that absurd Amedee .
Parsing [sent. 2517 len. 6]: She is Mrs. Harman . ''
Parsing [sent. 2518 len. 6]: `` You knew it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2519 len. 6]: I cried , hopelessly confused .
Parsing [sent. 2520 len. 12]: `` But Oliver still speaks of her as Madame d'Armand . ''
Parsing [sent. 2521 len. 6]: `` He does not know .
Parsing [sent. 2522 len. 7]: She has not told him . ''
Parsing [sent. 2523 len. 10]: `` But why have n't you told him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2524 len. 33]: `` Ha , that is a story , a poem , '' he cried , beginning to pace the floor again -- `` a ballad as old as the oldest of Provence !
Parsing [sent. 2525 len. 30]: There is a reason , my dear sir , which I can not tell you , but it lies within the romance of what you agree is my madness .
Parsing [sent. 2526 len. 12]: Some day , I hope , you shall understand and applaud !
Parsing [sent. 2527 len. 50]: In the meantime -- '' `` In the meantime , '' I said sharply , as he paused for breath , `` there is a keen-faced young man who took a room in the inn this morning and who has come to spy upon you , I believe . ''
Parsing [sent. 2528 len. 8]: `` What is it you say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2529 len. 7]: He came to a sudden stop .
Parsing [sent. 2530 len. 73]: I had not meant to deliver my information quite so abruptly , but there was no help for it now , and I repeated the statement , giving him a terse account of my two encounters with the rattish youth , and adding : `` He seemed to be certain that ` Oliver Saffren ' is an assumed name , and he made a threatening reference to the laws of France . ''
Parsing [sent. 2531 len. 10]: The effect upon Keredec was a very distinct pallor .
Parsing [sent. 2532 len. 30]: He faced me silently until I had finished , then in a voice grown suddenly husky , asked : `` Do you think he came back to the inn ?
Parsing [sent. 2533 len. 6]: Is he here now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2534 len. 7]: `` I do not know . ''
Parsing [sent. 2535 len. 14]: `` We must learn ; I must know that , at once . ''
Parsing [sent. 2536 len. 7]: And he went to the door .
Parsing [sent. 2537 len. 10]: `` Let me go instead , '' I suggested .
Parsing [sent. 2538 len. 57]: `` It ca n't make little difference if he see me , '' said the professor , swallowing with difficulty and displaying , as he turned to me , a look of such profound anxiety that I was as sorry for him now as I had been irritated a few minutes earlier by his galliard air-castles .
Parsing [sent. 2539 len. 40]: `` I do not know this man , nor does he know me , but I have fear '' -- his beard moved as though his chin were trembling -- `` I have fear that I know his employers .
Parsing [sent. 2540 len. 10]: Still , it may be better if you go .
Parsing [sent. 2541 len. 9]: Bring somebody here that we can ask . ''
Parsing [sent. 2542 len. 7]: `` Shall I find Amedee ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2543 len. 7]: `` No , no , no !
Parsing [sent. 2544 len. 3]: That babbler ?
Parsing [sent. 2545 len. 5]: Find Madame Brossard . ''
Parsing [sent. 2546 len. 54]: I stepped out to the gallery , to discover Madame Brossard emerging from a door on the opposite side of the courtyard ; Amedee , Glouglou , and a couple of carters deploying before her with some light trunks and bags , which they were carrying into the passage she had just quitted .
Parsing [sent. 2547 len. 22]: I summoned her quietly ; she came briskly up the steps and into the room , and I closed the door .
Parsing [sent. 2548 len. 18]: `` Madame Brossard , '' said the professor , `` you have a new client to-day . ''
Parsing [sent. 2549 len. 12]: `` That monsieur who arrived this morning , '' I suggested .
Parsing [sent. 2550 len. 30]: `` He was an American , '' said the hostess , knitting her dark brows -- `` but I do not think that he was exactly a monsieur . ''
Parsing [sent. 2551 len. 4]: `` Bravo ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2552 len. 3]: I murmured .
Parsing [sent. 2553 len. 6]: `` That sketches a likeness .
Parsing [sent. 2554 len. 11]: It is this ` Percy ' without a doubt . ''
Parsing [sent. 2555 len. 9]: `` That is it , '' she returned .
Parsing [sent. 2556 len. 10]: `` Monsieur Poissy is the name he gave . ''
Parsing [sent. 2557 len. 9]: `` Is he at the inn now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2558 len. 18]: `` No , monsieur , but two friends for whom he engaged apartments have just arrived . ''
Parsing [sent. 2559 len. 6]: `` Who are they ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2560 len. 4]: asked Keredec quickly .
Parsing [sent. 2561 len. 11]: `` It is a lady and a monsieur from Paris .
Parsing [sent. 2562 len. 23]: But not married : they have taken separate apartments and she has a domestic with her , a negress , Algerian . ''
Parsing [sent. 2563 len. 7]: `` What are their names ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2564 len. 11]: `` It is not ten minutes that they are installed .
Parsing [sent. 2565 len. 9]: They have not given me their names . ''
Parsing [sent. 2566 len. 9]: `` What is the lady 's appearance ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2567 len. 18]: `` Monsieur the Professor , '' replied the hostess demurely , `` she is not beautiful . ''
Parsing [sent. 2568 len. 7]: `` But what is she ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2569 len. 19]: demanded Keredec impatiently ; and it could be seen that he was striving to control a rising agitation .
Parsing [sent. 2570 len. 5]: `` Is she blonde ?
Parsing [sent. 2571 len. 4]: Is she brunette ?
Parsing [sent. 2572 len. 4]: Is she young ?
Parsing [sent. 2573 len. 4]: Is she old ?
Parsing [sent. 2574 len. 63]: Is she French , English , Spanish -- '' `` I think , '' said Madame Brossard , `` I think one would call her Spanish , but she is very fat , not young , and with a great deal too much rouge -- '' She stopped with an audible intake of breath , staring at my friend 's white face .
Parsing [sent. 2575 len. 3]: `` Eh !
Parsing [sent. 2576 len. 6]: it is bad news ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2577 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 2578 len. 18]: `` And when one has been so ill -- '' Keredec checked her with an imperious gesture .
Parsing [sent. 2579 len. 13]: `` Monsieur Saffren and I leave at once , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2580 len. 17]: `` I shall meet him on the road ; he will not return to the inn .
Parsing [sent. 2581 len. 7]: We go to -- to Trouville .
Parsing [sent. 2582 len. 25]: See that no one knows that we have gone until to-morrow , if possible ; I shall leave fees for the servants with you .
Parsing [sent. 2583 len. 15]: Go now , prepare your bill , and bring it to me at once .
Parsing [sent. 2584 len. 10]: I shall write you where to send our trunks .
Parsing [sent. 2585 len. 2]: Quick !
Parsing [sent. 2586 len. 44]: And you , my friend '' -- he turned to me as Madame Brossard , obviously distressed and frightened , but none the less intelligent for that , skurried away to do his bidding -- `` my friend , will you help us ?
Parsing [sent. 2587 len. 6]: For we need it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2588 len. 7]: `` Anything in the world ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2589 len. 30]: `` Go to Pere Baudry 's ; have him put the least tired of his three horses to his lightest cart and wait in the road beyond the cottage .
Parsing [sent. 2590 len. 11]: Stand in the road yourself while that is being done .
Parsing [sent. 2591 len. 9]: Oliver will come that way ; detain him .
Parsing [sent. 2592 len. 22]: I will join you there ; I have only to see to my papers -- at the most , twenty minutes .
Parsing [sent. 2593 len. 7]: Go quickly , my friend ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2594 len. 11]: I strode to the door and out to the gallery .
Parsing [sent. 2595 len. 31]: I was half-way down the steps before I saw that Oliver Saffren was already in the courtyard , coming toward me from the archway with a light and buoyant step .
Parsing [sent. 2596 len. 34]: He looked up , waving his hat to me , his face lighted with a happiness most remarkable , and brighter , even , than the strong , midsummer sunshine flaming over him .
Parsing [sent. 2597 len. 41]: Dressed in white as he was , and with the air of victory he wore , he might have been , at that moment , a figure from some marble triumph ; youthful , conquering -- crowned with the laurel .
Parsing [sent. 2598 len. 96]: I had time only to glance at him , to `` take '' him , as it were , between two shutter-flicks of the instantaneous eyelid , and with him , the courtyard flooded with sunshine , the figure of Madame Brossard emerging from her little office , Amedee coming from the kitchen bearing a white-covered tray , and , entering from the road , upon the trail of Saffren but still in the shadow of the archway , the discordant fineries and hatchet-face of the ex-pedestrian and tourist , my antagonist of the forest .
Parsing [sent. 2599 len. 10]: I had opened my mouth to call a warning .
Parsing [sent. 2600 len. 20]: `` Hurry '' was the word I would have said , but it stopped at `` hur -- . ''
Parsing [sent. 2601 len. 7]: The second syllable was never uttered .
Parsing [sent. 2602 len. 36]: There came a violent outcry , raucous and shrill as the wail of a captured hen , and out of the passage across the courtyard floundered a woman , fantastically dressed in green and gold .
Parsing [sent. 2603 len. 27]: Her coarse blue-black hair fell dishevelled upon her shoulders , from which her gown hung precariously unfastened , as if she had abandoned her toilet half-way .
Parsing [sent. 2604 len. 23]: She was abundantly fat , double-chinned , coarse , greasy , smeared with blue pencillings , carmine , enamel , and rouge .
Parsing [sent. 2605 len. 6]: At the scream Saffren turned .
Parsing [sent. 2606 len. 12]: She made straight at him , crying wildly : `` Enfin !
Parsing [sent. 2607 len. 9]: Mon mari , mon mari -- c'est moi !
Parsing [sent. 2608 len. 8]: C'est ta femme , mon coeur ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2609 len. 24]: She threw herself upon him , her arms about his neck , with a tropical ferocity that was a very paroxysm of triumph .
Parsing [sent. 2610 len. 6]: `` Embrasse moi , Larrabi !
Parsing [sent. 2611 len. 4]: Embrasse moi ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2612 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 2613 len. 24]: Horrified , outraged , his eyes blazing , he flung her off with a violence surpassing her own , and with loathing unspeakable .
Parsing [sent. 2614 len. 23]: She screamed that he was killing her , calling him `` husband , '' and tried to fasten herself upon him again .
Parsing [sent. 2615 len. 29]: But he leaped backward beyond the reach of her clutching hands , and , turning , plunged to the steps and staggered up them , the woman following .
Parsing [sent. 2616 len. 34]: From above me leaned the stricken face of Keredec ; he caught Saffren under the arm and half lifted him to the gallery , while she strove to hold him by the knees .
Parsing [sent. 2617 len. 5]: `` O Christ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2618 len. 3]: gasped Saffren .
Parsing [sent. 2619 len. 7]: `` Is THIS the woman ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2620 len. 32]: The giant swung him across the gallery and into the open door with one great sweep of the arm , strode in after him , and closed and bolted the door .
Parsing [sent. 2621 len. 25]: The woman fell in a heap at the foot of the steps , uttered a cracked simulation of the cry of a broken heart .
Parsing [sent. 2622 len. 9]: `` Name of a name of God ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2623 len. 3]: she wailed .
Parsing [sent. 2624 len. 6]: `` After all these years !
Parsing [sent. 2625 len. 7]: And my husband strikes me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2626 len. 18]: Then it was that what had been in my mind as a monstrous suspicion became a certainty .
Parsing [sent. 2627 len. 16]: For I recognised the woman ; she was Mariana -- la bella Mariana la Mursiana .
Parsing [sent. 2628 len. 56]: If I had ever known Larrabee Harman , if , instead of the two strange glimpses I had caught of him , I had been familiar with his gesture , walk , intonation -- even , perhaps , if I had ever heard his voice -- the truth might have come to me long ago .
Parsing [sent. 2629 len. 3]: Larrabee Harman !
Parsing [sent. 2630 len. 8]: `` Oliver Saffren '' was Larrabee Harman .
Parsing [sent. 2631 len. 50]: CHAPTER XVIII I do not like to read those poets who write of pain as if they loved it ; the study of suffering is for the cold analyst , for the vivisectionist , for those who may transfuse their knowledge of it to the ultimate good of mankind .
Parsing [sent. 2632 len. 38]: And although I am so heavily endowed with curiosity concerning the people I find about me , my gift -LRB- or curse , whichever it be -RRB- knows pause at the gates of the house of calamity .
Parsing [sent. 2633 len. 33]: So , if it were possible , I would not speak of the agony of which I was a witness that night in the apartment of my friends at Madame Brossard 's .
Parsing [sent. 2634 len. 11]: I went with reluctance , but there was no choice .
Parsing [sent. 2635 len. 6]: Keredec had sent for me .
Parsing [sent. 2636 len. 41]: ... When I was about fifteen , a boy cousin of mine , several years younger , terribly injured himself on the Fourth of July ; and I sat all night in the room with him , helping his mother .
Parsing [sent. 2637 len. 51]: Somehow he had learned that there was no hope of saving his sight ; he was an imaginative child and realised the whole meaning of the catastrophe ; the eternal darkness ... And he understood that the thing had been done , that there was no going back of it .
Parsing [sent. 2638 len. 12]: This very certainty increased the intensity of his rebellion a thousandfold .
Parsing [sent. 2639 len. 8]: `` I WILL have my eyes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2640 len. 3]: he screamed .
Parsing [sent. 2641 len. 4]: `` I WILL !
Parsing [sent. 2642 len. 4]: I WILL ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2643 len. 9]: Keredec had told his tragic ward too little .
Parsing [sent. 2644 len. 47]: The latter had understood but vaguely the nature of the catastrophe which overhung his return to France , and now that it was indeed concrete and definite , the guardian was forced into fuller disclosures , every word making the anguish of the listener more intolerable .
Parsing [sent. 2645 len. 35]: It was the horizonless despair of a child ; and that profound protest I had so often seen smouldering in his eyes culminated , at its crisis , in a wild flame of revolt .
Parsing [sent. 2646 len. 25]: The shame of the revelation passed over him ; there was nothing of the disastrous drunkard , sober , learning what he had done .
Parsing [sent. 2647 len. 19]: To him , it seemed that he was being forced to suffer for the sins of another man .
Parsing [sent. 2648 len. 17]: `` Do you think that you can make me believe _ I _ did this ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2649 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 2650 len. 26]: `` That I made life unbearable for HER , drove HER from me , and took this hideous , painted old woman in HER place ?
Parsing [sent. 2651 len. 5]: It 's a lie .
Parsing [sent. 2652 len. 13]: You ca n't make me believe such a monstrous lie as that !
Parsing [sent. 2653 len. 4]: You CA N'T !
Parsing [sent. 2654 len. 5]: You CA N'T ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2655 len. 17]: He threw himself violently upon the couch , face downward , shuddering from head to foot .
Parsing [sent. 2656 len. 26]: `` My poor boy , it is the truth , '' said Keredec , kneeling beside him and putting a great arm across his shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 2657 len. 12]: `` It is what a thousand men are doing this night .
Parsing [sent. 2658 len. 13]: Nothing is more common , or more unexplainable -- or more simple .
Parsing [sent. 2659 len. 30]: Of all the nations it is the same , wherever life has become artificial and the poor , foolish young men have too much money and nothing to do .
Parsing [sent. 2660 len. 28]: You do not understand it , but our friend here , and I , we understand because we remember what we have been seeing all our life .
Parsing [sent. 2661 len. 19]: You say it is not you who did such crazy , horrible things , and you are right .
Parsing [sent. 2662 len. 71]: When this poor woman who is so painted and greasy first caught you , when you began to give your money and your time and your life to her , when she got you into this horrible marriage with her , you were blind -- you went staggering , in a bad dream ; your soul hid away , far down inside you , with its hands over its face .
Parsing [sent. 2663 len. 84]: If it could have once stood straight , if the eyes of your body could have once been clean for it to look through , if you could have once been as you are to-day , or as you were when you were a little child , you would have cry out with horror both of her and of yourself , as you do now ; and you would have run away from her and from everything you had put in your life .
Parsing [sent. 2664 len. 27]: But , in your suffering you must rejoice : the triumph is that your mind hates that old life as greatly as your soul hates it .
Parsing [sent. 2665 len. 24]: You are as good as if you had never been the wild fellow -- yes , the wicked fellow -- that you were .
Parsing [sent. 2666 len. 22]: For a man who shakes off his sin is clean ; he stands as pure as if he had never sinned .
Parsing [sent. 2667 len. 54]: But though his emancipation can be so perfect , there is a law that he can not escape from the result of all the bad and foolish things he has done , for every act , every breath you draw , is immortal , and each has a consequence that is never ending .
Parsing [sent. 2668 len. 25]: And so , now , though you are purified , the suffering from these old actions is here , and you must abide it .
Parsing [sent. 2669 len. 11]: Ah , but that is a little thing , nothing !
Parsing [sent. 2670 len. 20]: -- that suffering -- compared to what you have gained , for you have gained your own soul ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2671 len. 17]: The desperate young man on the couch answered only with the sobbing of a broken-hearted child .
Parsing [sent. 2672 len. 24]: I came back to my pavilion after midnight , but I did not sleep , though I lay upon my bed until dawn .
Parsing [sent. 2673 len. 34]: Then I went for a long , hard walk , breakfasted at Dives , and begged a ride back to Madame Brossard 's in a peasant 's cart which was going that way .
Parsing [sent. 2674 len. 35]: I found George Ward waiting for me on the little veranda of the pavilion , looking handsomer and more prosperously distinguished and distinguishedly prosperous and generally well-conditioned than ever -- as I told him .
Parsing [sent. 2675 len. 24]: `` I have some news for you , '' he said after the hearty greeting -- `` an announcement , in fact . ''
Parsing [sent. 2676 len. 4]: `` Wait ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2677 len. 31]: I glanced at the interested attitude of Mr. Earl Percy , who was breakfasting at a table significantly near the gallery steps , and led the way into the pavilion .
Parsing [sent. 2678 len. 26]: `` You may as well not tell it in the hearing of that young man , '' I said , when the door was closed .
Parsing [sent. 2679 len. 6]: `` He is eccentric . ''
Parsing [sent. 2680 len. 16]: `` So I gathered , '' returned Ward , smiling , `` from his attire .
Parsing [sent. 2681 len. 10]: But it really would n't matter who heard it .
Parsing [sent. 2682 len. 9]: Elizabeth 's going to marry Cresson Ingle . ''
Parsing [sent. 2683 len. 14]: `` That is the news -- the announcement -- you spoke of ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2684 len. 8]: `` Yes , that is it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2685 len. 36]: To save my life I could not have told at that moment what else I had expected , or feared , that he might say , but certainly I took a deep breath of relief .
Parsing [sent. 2686 len. 10]: `` I am very glad , '' I said .
Parsing [sent. 2687 len. 9]: `` It should be a happy alliance . ''
Parsing [sent. 2688 len. 16]: `` On the whole , I think it will be , '' he returned thoughtfully .
Parsing [sent. 2689 len. 35]: `` Ingle 's done his share of hard living , and I once had a notion '' -- he glanced smiling at me -- `` well , I dare say you know my notion .
Parsing [sent. 2690 len. 16]: But it is a good match for Elizabeth and not without advantages on many counts .
Parsing [sent. 2691 len. 55]: You see , it 's time I married , myself ; she feels that very strongly and I think her decision to accept Ingle is partly due to her wish to make all clear for a new mistress of my household , -- though that 's putting it in a rather grandiloquent way . ''
Parsing [sent. 2692 len. 3]: He laughed .
Parsing [sent. 2693 len. 34]: `` And as you probably guess , I have an idea that some such arrangement might be somewhere on the wings of the wind on its way to me , before long . ''
Parsing [sent. 2694 len. 41]: He laughed again , but I did not , and noting my silence he turned upon me a more scrutinising look than he had yet given me , and said : `` My dear fellow , is something the matter ?
Parsing [sent. 2695 len. 5]: You look quite haggard .
Parsing [sent. 2696 len. 7]: You have n't been ill ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2697 len. 10]: `` No , I 've had a bad night .
Parsing [sent. 2698 len. 5]: That 's all . ''
Parsing [sent. 2699 len. 19]: `` Oh , I heard something of a riotous scene taking place over here , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2700 len. 12]: `` One of the gardeners was talking about it to Elizabeth .
Parsing [sent. 2701 len. 13]: Your bad night would n't be connected with that , would it ?
Parsing [sent. 2702 len. 8]: You have n't been playing Samaritan ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2703 len. 8]: `` What was it you heard ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2704 len. 4]: I asked quickly .
Parsing [sent. 2705 len. 8]: `` I did n't pay much attention .
Parsing [sent. 2706 len. 47]: He said that there was great excitement at Madame Brossard 's , because a strange woman had turned up and claimed an insane young man at the inn for her husband , and that they had a fight of some sort -- '' `` Damnation ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2707 len. 6]: I started from my chair .
Parsing [sent. 2708 len. 9]: `` Did Mrs. Harman hear this story ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2709 len. 9]: `` Not last night , I 'm certain .
Parsing [sent. 2710 len. 34]: Elizabeth said the gardener told her as she came down to the chateau gates to meet me when I arrived -- it was late , and Louise had already gone to her room .
Parsing [sent. 2711 len. 10]: In fact , I have not seen her yet .
Parsing [sent. 2712 len. 14]: But what difference could it possibly make whether she heard it or not ?
Parsing [sent. 2713 len. 10]: She does n't know these people , surely ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2714 len. 7]: `` She knows the man . ''
Parsing [sent. 2715 len. 15]: `` This insane -- '' `` He is not insane , '' I interrupted .
Parsing [sent. 2716 len. 17]: `` He has lost the memory of his earlier life -- lost it through an accident .
Parsing [sent. 2717 len. 8]: You and I saw the accident . ''
Parsing [sent. 2718 len. 11]: `` That 's impossible , '' said George , frowning .
Parsing [sent. 2719 len. 24]: `` I never saw but one accident that you -- '' `` That was the one : the man is Larrabee Harman . ''
Parsing [sent. 2720 len. 30]: George had struck a match to light a cigar ; but the operation remained incomplete : he dropped the match upon the floor and set his foot upon it .
Parsing [sent. 2721 len. 12]: `` Well , tell me about it , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2722 len. 13]: `` You have n't heard anything about him since the accident ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2723 len. 15]: `` Only that he did eventually recover and was taken away from the hospital .
Parsing [sent. 2724 len. 8]: I heard that his mind was impaired .
Parsing [sent. 2725 len. 14]: Does Louise -- '' he began ; stopped , and cleared his throat .
Parsing [sent. 2726 len. 11]: `` Has Mrs. Harman heard that he is here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2727 len. 9]: `` Yes ; she has seen him . ''
Parsing [sent. 2728 len. 11]: `` Do you mean the scoundrel has been bothering her ?
Parsing [sent. 2729 len. 27]: Elizabeth did n't tell me of this -- '' `` Your sister does n't know , '' I said , lifting my hand to check him .
Parsing [sent. 2730 len. 25]: `` I think you ought to understand the whole case -- if you 'll let me tell you what I know about it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2731 len. 9]: `` Go ahead , '' he bade me .
Parsing [sent. 2732 len. 24]: `` I 'll try to listen patiently , though the very thought of the fellow has always set my teeth on edge . ''
Parsing [sent. 2733 len. 14]: `` He 's not at all what you think , '' I said .
Parsing [sent. 2734 len. 26]: `` There 's an enormous difference , almost impossible to explain to you , but something you 'd understand at once if you saw him .
Parsing [sent. 2735 len. 28]: It 's such a difference , in fact , that when I found that he was Larrabee Harman the revelation was inexpressibly shocking and distressing to me .
Parsing [sent. 2736 len. 54]: He came here under another name ; I had no suspicion that he was any one I 'd ever heard of , much less that I 'd actually seen him twice , two years ago , and I 've grown to -- well , in truth , to be fond of him . ''
Parsing [sent. 2737 len. 7]: `` What is the change ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2738 len. 13]: asked Ward , and his voice showed that he was greatly disquieted .
Parsing [sent. 2739 len. 7]: `` What is he like ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2740 len. 50]: `` As well as I can tell you , he 's like an odd but very engaging boy , with something pathetic about him ; quite splendidly handsome -- '' `` Oh , he had good looks to spare when I first knew him , '' George said bitterly .
Parsing [sent. 2741 len. 25]: `` I dare say he 's got them back if he 's taken care of himself , or been taken care OF , rather !
Parsing [sent. 2742 len. 11]: But go on ; I wo n't interrupt you again .
Parsing [sent. 2743 len. 6]: Why did he come here ?
Parsing [sent. 2744 len. 8]: Hoping to see -- '' `` No .
Parsing [sent. 2745 len. 17]: When he came here he did not know of her existence except in the vaguest way .
Parsing [sent. 2746 len. 48]: But to go back to that , I 'd better tell you first that the woman we saw with him , one day on the boulevard , and who was in the accident with him -- '' `` La Mursiana , the dancer ; I know . ''
Parsing [sent. 2747 len. 18]: `` She had got him to go through a marriage with her -- '' `` WHAT ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2748 len. 10]: Ward 's eyes flashed as he shouted the word .
Parsing [sent. 2749 len. 37]: `` It seems inexplicable ; but as I understand it , he was never quite sober at that time ; he had begun to use drugs , and was often in a half - stupefied condition .
Parsing [sent. 2750 len. 15]: As a matter of fact , the woman did what she pleased with him .
Parsing [sent. 2751 len. 11]: There 's no doubt about the validity of the marriage .
Parsing [sent. 2752 len. 32]: And what makes it so desperate a muddle is that since the marriage she 's taken good care to give no grounds upon which a divorce could be obtained for Harman .
Parsing [sent. 2753 len. 7]: She means to hang on . ''
Parsing [sent. 2754 len. 8]: `` I 'm glad of that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2755 len. 11]: said George , striking his knee with his open palm .
Parsing [sent. 2756 len. 27]: `` That will go a great way toward -- '' He paused , and asked suddenly : `` Did this marriage take place in France ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2757 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 2758 len. 11]: You 'd better hear me through , '' I remonstrated .
Parsing [sent. 2759 len. 29]: `` When he was taken from the hospital , he was placed in charge of a Professor Keredec , a madman of whom you 've probably heard . ''
Parsing [sent. 2760 len. 3]: `` Madman ?
Parsing [sent. 2761 len. 21]: Why , no ; he 's a member of the Institute ; a psychologist or metaphysician , is n't he ?
Parsing [sent. 2762 len. 9]: -- at any rate of considerable celebrity . ''
Parsing [sent. 2763 len. 52]: `` Nevertheless , '' I insisted grimly , `` as misty a vapourer as I ever saw ; a poetic , self-contradicting and inconsistent orator , a blower of bubbles , a seer of visions , a mystic , and a dreamer -- about as scientific as Alice 's White Knight !
Parsing [sent. 2764 len. 71]: Harman 's aunt , who lived in London , the only relative he had left , I believe -- and she has died since -- put him in Keredec 's charge , and he was taken up into the Tyrol and virtually hidden for two years , the idea being literally to give him something like an education -- Keredec 's phrase is ` restore mind to his soul ' !
Parsing [sent. 2765 len. 19]: What must have been quite as vital was to get him out of his horrible wife 's clutches .
Parsing [sent. 2766 len. 12]: And they did it , for she could not find him .
Parsing [sent. 2767 len. 30]: But she picked up that rat in the garden out yonder -- he 'd been some sort of stable-manager for Harman once -- and set him on the track .
Parsing [sent. 2768 len. 13]: He ran the poor boy down , and yesterday she followed him .
Parsing [sent. 2769 len. 11]: Now it amounts to a species of sordid siege . ''
Parsing [sent. 2770 len. 9]: `` She wants money , of course . ''
Parsing [sent. 2771 len. 16]: `` Yes , MORE money ; a fair allowance has always been sent to her .
Parsing [sent. 2772 len. 23]: Keredec has interviewed her notary and she wants a settlement , naming a sum actually larger than the whole estate amounts to .
Parsing [sent. 2773 len. 43]: There were colossal expenditures and equally large shrinkages ; what he has left is invested in English securities and is not a fortune , but of course she wo n't believe that and refuses to budge until this impossible settlement is made .
Parsing [sent. 2774 len. 19]: You can imagine about how competent such a man as Keredec would be to deal with the situation .
Parsing [sent. 2775 len. 54]: In the mean time , his ward is in so dreadful a state of horror and grief I am afraid it is possible that his mind may really give way , for it was not in a normal condition , of course , though he 's perfectly sane , as I tell you .
Parsing [sent. 2776 len. 29]: If it should , '' I concluded , with some bitterness , `` I suppose Keredec will be still prating upliftingly on the saving of his soul ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2777 len. 10]: `` When was it that Louise saw him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2778 len. 22]: `` Ah , that , '' I said , `` is where Keredec has been a poet and a dreamer indeed .
Parsing [sent. 2779 len. 10]: It was his PLAN that they should meet . ''
Parsing [sent. 2780 len. 26]: `` You mean he brought this wreck of Harman , these husks and shreds of a man , down here for Louise to see ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2781 len. 4]: Ward cried incredulously .
Parsing [sent. 2782 len. 6]: `` Oh , monstrous ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2783 len. 7]: `` No , '' I answered .
Parsing [sent. 2784 len. 4]: `` Only insane .
Parsing [sent. 2785 len. 51]: Not because there is anything lacking in Oliver -- in Harman , I mean -- for I think that will be righted in time , but because the second marriage makes it a useless cruelty that he should have been allowed to fall in love with his first wife again .
Parsing [sent. 2786 len. 19]: Yet that was Keredec 's idea of a ` beautiful restoration , ' as he calls it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2787 len. 18]: `` There is something behind all this that you do n't know , '' said Ward slowly .
Parsing [sent. 2788 len. 12]: `` I 'll tell you after I 've seen this Keredec .
Parsing [sent. 2789 len. 10]: When did the man make you his confidant ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2790 len. 4]: `` Last night .
Parsing [sent. 2791 len. 19]: Most of what I learned was as much a revelation to his victim as it was to me .
Parsing [sent. 2792 len. 30]: Harman did not know till then that the lady he had been meeting had been his wife , or that he had ever seen her before he came here .
Parsing [sent. 2793 len. 13]: He had mistaken her name and she did not enlighten him . ''
Parsing [sent. 2794 len. 4]: `` Meeting ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2795 len. 4]: said Ward harshly .
Parsing [sent. 2796 len. 18]: `` You speak as if -- '' `` They have been meeting every day , George . ''
Parsing [sent. 2797 len. 10]: `` I wo n't believe it of her ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2798 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 2799 len. 11]: `` She could n't -- '' `` It 's true .
Parsing [sent. 2800 len. 17]: He spoke to her in the woods one day ; I was there and saw it .
Parsing [sent. 2801 len. 21]: I know now that she knew him at once ; and she ran away , but -- not in anger .
Parsing [sent. 2802 len. 27]: I should n't be a very good friend of yours , '' I went on gently , `` if I did n't give you the truth .
Parsing [sent. 2803 len. 30]: They 've been together every day since then , and I 'm afraid -- miserably afraid , Ward -- that her old feeling for him has been revived . ''
Parsing [sent. 2804 len. 23]: I have heard Ward use an oath only two or three times in my life , and this was one of them .
Parsing [sent. 2805 len. 7]: `` Oh , by God ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2806 len. 18]: he cried , starting to his feet ; `` I SHOULD like to meet Professor Keredec ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2807 len. 20]: `` I am at your service , my dear sir , '' said a deep voice from the veranda .
Parsing [sent. 2808 len. 12]: And opening the door , the professor walked into the room .
Parsing [sent. 2809 len. 29]: CHAPTER XIX He looked old and tired and sad ; it was plain that he expected attack and equally plain that he would meet it with fanatic serenity .
Parsing [sent. 2810 len. 68]: And yet , the magnificent blunderer presented so fine an aspect of the tortured Olympian , he confronted us with so vast a dignity -- the driven snow of his hair tousled upon his head and shoulders , like a storm in the higher altitudes -- that he regained , in my eyes , something of his mountain grandeur before he had spoken a word in defence .
Parsing [sent. 2811 len. 27]: But sympathy is not what one should be entertaining for an antagonist ; therefore I said cavalierly : `` This is Mr. Ward , Professor Keredec .
Parsing [sent. 2812 len. 11]: He is Mrs. Harman 's cousin and close friend . ''
Parsing [sent. 2813 len. 7]: `` I had divined it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2814 len. 24]: The professor made a French bow , and George responded with as slight a salutation as it has been my lot to see .
Parsing [sent. 2815 len. 21]: `` We were speaking of your reasons , '' I continued , `` for bringing Mr. Harman to this place .
Parsing [sent. 2816 len. 9]: Frankly , we were questioning your motive . ''
Parsing [sent. 2817 len. 4]: `` My motives ?
Parsing [sent. 2818 len. 17]: I have wished to restore to two young people the paradise which they had lost '' .
Parsing [sent. 2819 len. 60]: Ward uttered an exclamation none the less violent because it was half - suppressed , while , for my part , I laughed outright ; and as Keredec turned his eyes questioningly upon me , I said : `` Professor Keredec , you 'd better understand at once that I mean to help undo the harm you 've done .
Parsing [sent. 2820 len. 40]: I could n't tell you last night , in Harman 's presence , but I think you 're responsible for the whole ghastly tragi - comedy -- as hopeless a tangle as ever was made on this earth ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2821 len. 61]: This was even more roughly spoken than I had intended , but it did not cause him to look less mildly upon me , nor was there the faintest shadow of resentment in his big voice when he replied : `` In this world things may be tangled , they may be sad , yet they may be good . ''
Parsing [sent. 2822 len. 11]: `` I 'm afraid that seems rather a trite generality .
Parsing [sent. 2823 len. 15]: I beg you to remember that plain-speaking is of some importance just now . ''
Parsing [sent. 2824 len. 6]: `` I shall remember . ''
Parsing [sent. 2825 len. 27]: `` Then we should be glad of the explanation , '' said Ward , resting his arms on my table and leaning across it toward Keredec .
Parsing [sent. 2826 len. 10]: `` We should , indeed , '' I echoed .
Parsing [sent. 2827 len. 10]: `` It is simple , '' began the professor .
Parsing [sent. 2828 len. 45]: `` I learned my poor boy 's history well , from those who could tell me , from his papers -- yes , and from the bundles of old-time letters which were given me -- since it was necessary that I should know everything .
Parsing [sent. 2829 len. 30]: From all these I learned what a strong and beautiful soul was that lady who loved him so much that she ran away from her home for his sake .
Parsing [sent. 2830 len. 2]: Helas !
Parsing [sent. 2831 len. 36]: he was already the slave of what was bad and foolish , he had gone too far from himself , was overlaid with the habit of evil , and she could not save him then .
Parsing [sent. 2832 len. 62]: The spirit was dying in him , although it was there , and IT was good -- '' Ward 's acrid laughter rang out in the room , and my admiration went unwillingly to Keredec for the way he took it , which was to bow gravely , as if acknowledging the other 's right to his own point of view .
Parsing [sent. 2833 len. 23]: `` If you will study the antique busts , '' he said , `` you will find that Socrates is Silenus dignified .
Parsing [sent. 2834 len. 19]: I choose to believe in the infinite capacities of all men -- and in the spirit in all .
Parsing [sent. 2835 len. 15]: And so I try to restore my poor boy his capacities and his spirit .
Parsing [sent. 2836 len. 6]: But that was not all .
Parsing [sent. 2837 len. 48]: The time was coming when I could do no more for him , when the little education of books would be finish ' and he must go out in the world again to learn -- all newly -- how to make of himself a man of use .
Parsing [sent. 2838 len. 31]: That is the time of danger , and the thought was troubling me when I learned that Madame Harman was here , near this inn , of which I knew .
Parsing [sent. 2839 len. 6]: So I brought him . ''
Parsing [sent. 2840 len. 12]: `` The inconceivable selfishness , the devilish brutality of it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2841 len. 6]: Ward 's face was scarlet .
Parsing [sent. 2842 len. 15]: `` You did n't care how you sacrificed her -- '' `` Sacrificed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2843 len. 11]: The professor suddenly released the huge volume of his voice .
Parsing [sent. 2844 len. 4]: `` Sacrificed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2845 len. 3]: he thundered .
Parsing [sent. 2846 len. 34]: `` If I could give him back to her as he is now , it would be restoring to her all that she had loved in him , the real SELF of him !
Parsing [sent. 2847 len. 11]: It would be the greatest gift in her life . ''
Parsing [sent. 2848 len. 7]: `` You speak for her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2849 len. 11]: demanded Ward , the question coming like a lawyer 's .
Parsing [sent. 2850 len. 16]: It failed to disturb Keredec , who replied quietly : `` It is a quibble .
Parsing [sent. 2851 len. 11]: I speak for her , yes , my dear sir .
Parsing [sent. 2852 len. 57]: Her action in defiance of her family and her friends proved the strength of what she felt for the man she married ; that she have remained with him three years -- until it was impossible -- proved its persistence ; her letters , which I read with reverence , proved its beauty -- to me .
Parsing [sent. 2853 len. 12]: It was a living passion , one that could not die .
Parsing [sent. 2854 len. 14]: To let them see each other again ; that was all I intended .
Parsing [sent. 2855 len. 20]: To give them their new chance -- and then , for myself , to keep out of the way .
Parsing [sent. 2856 len. 40]: That was why -- '' he turned to me -- `` that was why I have been guilty of pretending to have that bad rheumatism , and I hope you will not think it an ugly trick of me !
Parsing [sent. 2857 len. 22]: It was to give him his chance freely ; and though at first I had much anxiety , it was done .
Parsing [sent. 2858 len. 37]: In spite of all his wicked follies theirs had been a true love , and nothing in this world could be more inevitable than that they should come together again if the chance could be given .
Parsing [sent. 2859 len. 8]: And they HAVE , my dear sirs !
Parsing [sent. 2860 len. 5]: It has so happened .
Parsing [sent. 2861 len. 29]: To him it has been a wooing as if for the first time ; so she has preferred it , keeping him to his mistake of her name .
Parsing [sent. 2862 len. 63]: She feared that if he knew that it was the same as his own he might ask questions of me , and , you see , she did not know that I had made this little plan , and was afraid -- '' `` We are not questioning Mrs. Harman 's motives , '' George interrupted hotly , `` but YOURS ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2863 len. 12]: `` Very well , my dear sir ; that is all .
Parsing [sent. 2864 len. 6]: I have explained them . ''
Parsing [sent. 2865 len. 5]: `` You have ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2866 len. 3]: I interjected .
Parsing [sent. 2867 len. 16]: `` Then , my dear Keredec , either you are really insane or I am !
Parsing [sent. 2868 len. 35]: You knew that this poor , unfortunate devil of a Harman was tied to that hyenic prowler yonder who means to fatten on him , and will never release him ; you knew that .
Parsing [sent. 2869 len. 20]: Then why did you bring him down here to fall in love with a woman he can never have ?
Parsing [sent. 2870 len. 22]: In pity 's name , if you did n't hope to half kill them both , what DID you mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2871 len. 18]: `` My dear fellow , '' interposed George quickly , `` you underrate Professor Keredec 's shrewdness .
Parsing [sent. 2872 len. 10]: His plans are not so simple as you think .
Parsing [sent. 2873 len. 15]: He knows that my cousin Louise never obtained a divorce from her husband . ''
Parsing [sent. 2874 len. 4]: `` What ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2875 len. 9]: I said , not immediately comprehending his meaning .
Parsing [sent. 2876 len. 12]: `` I say , Mrs. Harman never obtained a divorce . ''
Parsing [sent. 2877 len. 6]: `` Are you delirious ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2878 len. 3]: I gasped .
Parsing [sent. 2879 len. 11]: `` It 's the truth ; she never did . ''
Parsing [sent. 2880 len. 12]: `` I saw a notice of it at the time . '
Parsing [sent. 2881 len. 4]: A notice ? '
Parsing [sent. 2882 len. 6]: I saw a hundred ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2883 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 2884 len. 13]: What you saw was that she had made an application for divorce .
Parsing [sent. 2885 len. 11]: Her family got her that far and then she revolted .
Parsing [sent. 2886 len. 6]: The suit was dropped . ''
Parsing [sent. 2887 len. 11]: `` It is true , indeed , '' said Keredec .
Parsing [sent. 2888 len. 20]: `` The poor boy was on the other side of the world , and he thought it was granted .
Parsing [sent. 2889 len. 18]: He had been bad before , but from that time he cared nothing what became of him .
Parsing [sent. 2890 len. 15]: That was the reason this Spanish woman -- '' I turned upon him sharply .
Parsing [sent. 2891 len. 6]: `` YOU knew it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2892 len. 29]: `` It is a year that I have known it ; when his estate was -- '' `` Then why did n't you tell me last night ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2893 len. 24]: `` My dear sir , I could not in HIS presence , because it is one thing I dare not let him know .
Parsing [sent. 2894 len. 39]: This Spanish woman is so hideous , her claim upon him is so horrible to him I could not hope to control him -- he would shout it out to her that she can not call him husband .
Parsing [sent. 2895 len. 8]: God knows what he would do ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2896 len. 14]: `` Well , why should n't he shout it out to her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2897 len. 39]: `` You do not understand , '' George interposed again , `` that what Professor Keredec risked for his ` poor boy , ' in returning to France , was a trial on the charge of bigamy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2898 len. 8]: The professor recoiled from the definite brutality .
Parsing [sent. 2899 len. 5]: `` My dear sir !
Parsing [sent. 2900 len. 12]: It is not possible that such a thing can happen . ''
Parsing [sent. 2901 len. 36]: `` I conceive it very likely to happen , '' said George , `` unless you get him out of the country before the lady now installed here as his wife discovers the truth . ''
Parsing [sent. 2902 len. 7]: `` But she must not ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2903 len. 18]: Keredec lifted both hands toward Ward appealingly ; they trembled , and his voice betrayed profound agitation .
Parsing [sent. 2904 len. 5]: `` She can not !
Parsing [sent. 2905 len. 19]: She has never suspected such a thing ; there is nothing that could MAKE her suspect it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2906 len. 15]: `` One particular thing would be my telling her , '' said Ward quietly .
Parsing [sent. 2907 len. 4]: `` Never ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2908 len. 9]: cried the professor , stepping back from him .
Parsing [sent. 2909 len. 8]: `` You could not do that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2910 len. 23]: `` I not only could , but I will , unless you get him out of the country -- and quickly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2911 len. 4]: `` George ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2912 len. 8]: I exclaimed , coming forward between them .
Parsing [sent. 2913 len. 8]: `` This wo n't do at all .
Parsing [sent. 2914 len. 33]: You ca n't -- '' `` That 's enough , '' he said , waving me back , and I saw that his hand was shaking , too , like Keredec 's .
Parsing [sent. 2915 len. 24]: His face had grown very white ; but he controlled himself to speak with a coolness that made what he said painfully convincing .
Parsing [sent. 2916 len. 21]: `` I know what you think , '' he went on , addressing me , `` but you 're wrong .
Parsing [sent. 2917 len. 6]: It is n't for myself .
Parsing [sent. 2918 len. 59]: When I sailed for New York in the spring I thought there was a chance that she would carry out the action she begun four years ago and go through the form of ridding herself of him definitely ; that is , I thought there was some hope for me ; I believed there was until this morning .
Parsing [sent. 2919 len. 6]: But I know better now .
Parsing [sent. 2920 len. 23]: If she 's seen him again , and he 's been anything except literally unbearable , it 's all over with ME .
Parsing [sent. 2921 len. 29]: From the first , I never had a chance against him ; he was a hard rival , even when he 'd become only a cruel memory . ''
Parsing [sent. 2922 len. 4]: His voice rose .
Parsing [sent. 2923 len. 46]: `` I 've lived a sober , decent life , and I 've treated HER with gentleness and reverence since she was born , and HE 'S done nothing but make a stew-pan of his life and neglect and betray her when he had her .
Parsing [sent. 2924 len. 39]: Heaven knows why it is ; it is n't because of anything he 's done or has , it 's just because it 's HIM , I suppose , but I know my chance is gone for good !
Parsing [sent. 2925 len. 20]: THAT leaves me free to act for her ; no one can accuse me of doing it for myself .
Parsing [sent. 2926 len. 23]: And I swear she sha 'n' t go through that slough of despond again while I have breath in my body ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2927 len. 6]: `` Steady , George ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2928 len. 3]: I said .
Parsing [sent. 2929 len. 12]: `` Oh , I 'm steady enough , '' he cried .
Parsing [sent. 2930 len. 9]: `` Professor Keredec shall be convinced of it !
Parsing [sent. 2931 len. 42]: My cousin is not going into the mire again ; she shall be freed of it for ever : I speak as her relative now , the representative of her family and of those who care for her happiness and good .
Parsing [sent. 2932 len. 11]: Now she SHALL make the separation definite -- and LEGAL !
Parsing [sent. 2933 len. 15]: And let Professor Keredec get his ` poor boy ' out of the country .
Parsing [sent. 2934 len. 6]: Let him do it quickly !
Parsing [sent. 2935 len. 17]: I make it as a condition of my not informing the woman yonder and her lawyer .
Parsing [sent. 2936 len. 20]: And by my hope of salvation I warn you -- '' `` George , for pity 's sake ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2937 len. 33]: I shouted , throwing my arm about his shoulders , for his voice had risen to a pitch of excitement and fury that I feared must bring the whole place upon us .
Parsing [sent. 2938 len. 23]: He caught himself up suddenly , stared at me blankly for a moment , then sank into a chair with a groan .
Parsing [sent. 2939 len. 29]: As he did so I became aware of a sound that had been worrying my subconsciousness for an indefinite length of time , and realised what it was .
Parsing [sent. 2940 len. 7]: Some one was knocking for admission .
Parsing [sent. 2941 len. 9]: I crossed the room and opened the door .
Parsing [sent. 2942 len. 24]: Miss Elizabeth stood there , red - faced and flustered , and behind her stood Mr. Cresson Ingle , who looked dubiously amused .
Parsing [sent. 2943 len. 11]: `` Ah -- come in , '' I said awkwardly .
Parsing [sent. 2944 len. 5]: `` George is here .
Parsing [sent. 2945 len. 15]: Let me present Professor Keredec -- '' '' ` George is here ! ' ''
Parsing [sent. 2946 len. 22]: echoed Miss Elizabeth , interrupting , and paying no attention whatever to an agitated bow on the part of the professor .
Parsing [sent. 2947 len. 7]: `` I should say he WAS !
Parsing [sent. 2948 len. 11]: They probably know THAT all the way to Trouville ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2949 len. 9]: `` We were discussing -- '' I began .
Parsing [sent. 2950 len. 15]: `` Ah , I know what you were discussing , '' she said impatiently .
Parsing [sent. 2951 len. 7]: `` Come in , Cresson . ''
Parsing [sent. 2952 len. 11]: She turned to Mr. Ingle , who was obviously reluctant .
Parsing [sent. 2953 len. 19]: `` It is a family matter , and you 'll have to go through with it now . ''
Parsing [sent. 2954 len. 9]: `` That reminds me , '' I said .
Parsing [sent. 2955 len. 11]: `` May I offer -- '' `` Not now ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2956 len. 16]: Miss Elizabeth cut short a rather embarrassed handshake which her betrothed and I were exchanging .
Parsing [sent. 2957 len. 24]: `` I 'm in a very nervous and distressed state of mind , as I suppose we all are , for that matter .
Parsing [sent. 2958 len. 26]: This morning I learned the true situation over here ; and I 'm afraid Louise has heard ; at least she 's not at Quesnay .
Parsing [sent. 2959 len. 24]: I got into a panic for fear she had come here , but thank heaven she does not seem to -- Good gracious !
Parsing [sent. 2960 len. 5]: What 's THAT ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2961 len. 15]: It was the discordant voice of Mariana la Mursiana , crackling in strident protest .
Parsing [sent. 2962 len. 41]: My door was still open ; I turned to look and saw her , hot-faced , tousle-haired , insufficiently wrapped , striving to ascend the gallery steps , but valiantly opposed by Madame Brossard , who stood in the way .
Parsing [sent. 2963 len. 16]: `` But NO , madame , '' insisted Madame Brossard , excited but darkly determined .
Parsing [sent. 2964 len. 6]: `` You can not ascend .
Parsing [sent. 2965 len. 18]: There is nothing on the upper floor of this wing except the apartment of Professor Keredec . ''
Parsing [sent. 2966 len. 7]: `` Name of a dog ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2967 len. 4]: shrilled the other .
Parsing [sent. 2968 len. 12]: `` It is my husband 's apartment , I tell you .
Parsing [sent. 2969 len. 9]: Il y a une femme avec lui ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2970 len. 17]: `` It is Madame Harman who is there , '' said Keredec hoarsely in my ear .
Parsing [sent. 2971 len. 10]: `` I came away and left them together . ''
Parsing [sent. 2972 len. 44]: `` Come , '' I said , and , letting the others think what they would , sprang across the veranda , the professor beside me , and ran toward the two women who were beginning to struggle with more than their tongues .
Parsing [sent. 2973 len. 29]: I leaped by them and up the steps , but Keredec thrust himself between our hostess and her opponent , planting his great bulk on the lowest step .
Parsing [sent. 2974 len. 30]: Glancing hurriedly over my shoulder , I saw the Spanish woman strike him furiously upon the breast with both hands , but I knew she would never pass him .
Parsing [sent. 2975 len. 19]: I entered the salon of the `` Grande Suite , '' and closed the door quickly behind me .
Parsing [sent. 2976 len. 26]: Louise Harman was standing at the other end of the room ; she wore the pretty dress of white and lilac and the white hat .
Parsing [sent. 2977 len. 16]: She looked cool and beautiful and good , and there were tears in her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2978 len. 31]: To come into this quiet chamber and see her so , after the hot sunshine and tawdry scene below , was like leaving the shouting market-place for a shadowy chapel .
Parsing [sent. 2979 len. 40]: Her husband was kneeling beside her ; he held one of her hands in both his , her other rested upon his head ; and something in their attitudes made me know I had come in upon their leave-taking .
Parsing [sent. 2980 len. 29]: But from the face he lifted toward her all trace of his tragedy had passed : the wonder and worship written there left no room for anything else .
Parsing [sent. 2981 len. 8]: `` Mrs. Harman -- '' I began .
Parsing [sent. 2982 len. 4]: `` Yes ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2983 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 2984 len. 6]: `` I am coming . ''
Parsing [sent. 2985 len. 9]: `` But I do n't want you to .
Parsing [sent. 2986 len. 19]: I 've come for fear you would , and you -- you must not , '' I stammered .
Parsing [sent. 2987 len. 6]: `` You must wait . ''
Parsing [sent. 2988 len. 4]: `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2989 len. 9]: `` It 's necessary , '' I floundered .
Parsing [sent. 2990 len. 16]: `` There is a scene -- '' `` I know , '' she said quietly .
Parsing [sent. 2991 len. 9]: `` THAT must be , of course . ''
Parsing [sent. 2992 len. 16]: Harman rose , and she took both his hands , holding them against her breast .
Parsing [sent. 2993 len. 18]: `` My dear , '' she said gently , -- `` my dearest , you must stay .
Parsing [sent. 2994 len. 20]: Will you promise not to pass that door , even , until you have word from me again ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2995 len. 21]: `` Yes , '' he answered huskily , `` if you 'll promise it SHALL come -- some day ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2996 len. 6]: `` It shall , indeed .
Parsing [sent. 2997 len. 6]: Be sure of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2998 len. 20]: I had turned away , but I heard the ghost of his voice whispering `` good - bye . ''
Parsing [sent. 2999 len. 10]: Then she was beside me and opening the door .
Parsing [sent. 3000 len. 6]: I tried to stay her .
Parsing [sent. 3001 len. 28]: `` Mrs. Harman , '' I urged , `` I earnestly beg you -- '' `` No , '' she answered , `` this is better . ''
Parsing [sent. 3002 len. 16]: She stepped out upon the gallery ; I followed , and she closed the door .
Parsing [sent. 3003 len. 65]: Upon the veranda of my pavilion were my visitors from Quesnay , staring up at us apprehensively ; Madame Brossard and Keredec still held the foot of the steps , but la Mursiana had abandoned the siege , and , accompanied by Mr. Percy and Rameau , the black-bearded notary , who had joined her , was crossing the garden toward her own apartment .
Parsing [sent. 3004 len. 40]: At the sound of the closing door , she glanced over her shoulder , sent forth a scream , and , whirling about , ran viciously for the steps , where she was again blocked by the indomitable Keredec .
Parsing [sent. 3005 len. 34]: `` Ah , you foolish woman , I know who you are , '' she cried , stepping back from him to shake a menacing hand at the quiet lady by my side .
Parsing [sent. 3006 len. 9]: `` You want to get yourself into trouble !
Parsing [sent. 3007 len. 18]: That man in the room up there has been my husband these two years and more . ''
Parsing [sent. 3008 len. 21]: `` No , madame , '' said Louise Harman , `` you are mistaken ; he is my husband . ''
Parsing [sent. 3009 len. 12]: `` But you divorced him , '' vociferated the other wildly .
Parsing [sent. 3010 len. 8]: `` You divorced him in America ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3011 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 3012 len. 10]: You are mistaken , '' the quiet voice replied .
Parsing [sent. 3013 len. 6]: `` The suit was withdrawn .
Parsing [sent. 3014 len. 7]: He is still my husband . ''
Parsing [sent. 3015 len. 20]: I heard the professor 's groan of despair , but it was drowned in the wild shriek of Mariana .
Parsing [sent. 3016 len. 3]: `` WHAT ?
Parsing [sent. 3017 len. 5]: You tell ME that ?
Parsing [sent. 3018 len. 5]: Ah , the miserable !
Parsing [sent. 3019 len. 12]: If what you say is true , he shall pay bitterly !
Parsing [sent. 3020 len. 10]: He shall wish that he had died by fire !
Parsing [sent. 3021 len. 2]: What !
Parsing [sent. 3022 len. 36]: You think he can marry ME , break my leg so that I can not dance again , ruin my career , and then go away with a pretty woman like you and be happy ?
Parsing [sent. 3023 len. 38]: Aha , there are prisons in France for people who marry two like that ; I do not know what they do in YOUR barbaric country , but they are decent people over here and they punish .
Parsing [sent. 3024 len. 29]: He shall pay for it in suffering -- '' her voice rose to an incredible and unbearable shriek -- `` and you , YOU shall pay , too !
Parsing [sent. 3025 len. 12]: You ca n't come stealing honest women 's husbands like that .
Parsing [sent. 3026 len. 5]: You shall PAY ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3027 len. 47]: I saw George Ward come running forward with his hand upraised in a gesture of passionate warning , for Mrs. Harman , unnoticed by me -- I was watching the Spanish woman -- had descended the steps and had passed Keredec , walking straight to Mariana .
Parsing [sent. 3028 len. 17]: I leaped down after her , my heart in my throat , fearing a thousand things .
Parsing [sent. 3029 len. 27]: `` You must not talk like that , '' she said , not lifting her voice -- yet every one in the courtyard heard her distinctly .
Parsing [sent. 3030 len. 14]: `` You can do neither of us any harm in the world . ''
Parsing [sent. 3031 len. 55]: CHAPTER XX It is impossible to say what Mariana would have done had there been no interference , for she had worked herself into one of those furies which women of her type can attain when they feel the occasion demands it , a paroxysm none the less dangerous because its foundation is histrionic .
Parsing [sent. 3032 len. 33]: But Rameau threw his arms about her ; Mr. Percy came hastily to his assistance , and Ward and I sprang in between her and the too-fearless lady she strove to reach .
Parsing [sent. 3033 len. 25]: Even at that , the finger-nails of Mariana 's right hand touched the pretty white hat -- but only touched it and no more .
Parsing [sent. 3034 len. 69]: Rameau and the little spy managed to get their vociferating burden across the courtyard and into her own door , where she suddenly subsided , disappearing within the passage to her apartment in unexpected silence -- indubitably a disappointment to the interested Amedee , to Glouglou , Francois , and the whole personnel of the inn , who hastened to group themselves about the door in attentive attitudes .
Parsing [sent. 3035 len. 24]: `` In heaven 's name , '' gasped Miss Elizabeth , seizing her cousin by the arm , `` come into the pavilion .
Parsing [sent. 3036 len. 10]: Here 's the whole world looking at us ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3037 len. 18]: `` Professor Keredec -- '' Mrs. Harman began , resisting , and turning to the professor appealingly .
Parsing [sent. 3038 len. 9]: `` Oh , let him come too ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3039 len. 5]: said Miss Elizabeth desperately .
Parsing [sent. 3040 len. 9]: `` Nothing could be worse than this ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3041 len. 65]: She led the way back to the pavilion , and , refusing to consider a proposal on the part of Mr. Ingle and myself to remain outside , entered the room last , herself , producing an effect of `` shooing '' the rest of us in ; closed the door with surprising force , relapsed in a chair , and burst into tears .
Parsing [sent. 3042 len. 23]: `` Not a soul at Quesnay , '' sobbed the mortified chatelaine -- `` not one but will know this before dinner !
Parsing [sent. 3043 len. 11]: They 'll hear the whole thing within two hours . ''
Parsing [sent. 3044 len. 14]: `` Is n't there any way of stopping that , at least ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3045 len. 5]: Ward said to me .
Parsing [sent. 3046 len. 27]: `` None on earth , unless you go home at once and turn your visitors and THEIR servants out of the house , '' I answered .
Parsing [sent. 3047 len. 14]: `` There is nothing they should n't know , '' said Mrs. Harman .
Parsing [sent. 3048 len. 17]: George turned to her with a smile so bravely managed that I was proud of him .
Parsing [sent. 3049 len. 12]: `` Oh , yes , there is , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3050 len. 13]: `` We 're going to get you out of all this . ''
Parsing [sent. 3051 len. 5]: `` All this ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3052 len. 3]: she repeated .
Parsing [sent. 3053 len. 6]: `` All this MIRE ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3054 len. 3]: he answered .
Parsing [sent. 3055 len. 22]: `` We 're going to get you out of it and keep you out of it , now , for good .
Parsing [sent. 3056 len. 30]: I do n't know whether your revelation to the Spanish woman will make that easier or harder , but I do know that it makes the mire deeper . ''
Parsing [sent. 3057 len. 5]: `` For whom ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3058 len. 4]: `` For Harman .
Parsing [sent. 3059 len. 9]: But you sha 'n' t share it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3060 len. 6]: Her anxious eyes grew wider .
Parsing [sent. 3061 len. 10]: `` How have I made it deeper for him ?
Parsing [sent. 3062 len. 15]: Was n't it necessary that the poor woman should be told the truth ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3063 len. 14]: `` Professor Keredec seemed to think it important that she should n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 3064 len. 26]: She turned to Keredec with a frightened gesture and an unintelligible word of appeal , as if entreating him to deny what George had said .
Parsing [sent. 3065 len. 26]: The professor 's beard was trembling ; he looked haggard ; an almost pitiable apprehension hung upon his eyelids ; but he came forward manfully .
Parsing [sent. 3066 len. 21]: `` Madame , '' he said , `` you could never in your life do anything that would make harm .
Parsing [sent. 3067 len. 21]: You were right to speak , and I had short sight to fear , since it was the truth . ''
Parsing [sent. 3068 len. 9]: `` But why did you fear it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3069 len. 12]: `` It was because -- '' he began , and hesitated .
Parsing [sent. 3070 len. 11]: `` I must know the reason , '' she urged .
Parsing [sent. 3071 len. 11]: `` I must know just what I 've done . ''
Parsing [sent. 3072 len. 32]: `` It was because , '' he repeated , running a nervous hand through his beard , `` because the knowledge would put us so utterly in this people 's power .
Parsing [sent. 3073 len. 22]: Already they demand more than we could give them ; now they can -- '' `` They can do what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3074 len. 4]: she asked tremulously .
Parsing [sent. 3075 len. 11]: His eyes rested gently on her blanched and stricken face .
Parsing [sent. 3076 len. 14]: `` Nothing , my dear lady , '' he answered , swallowing painfully .
Parsing [sent. 3077 len. 6]: `` Nothing that will last .
Parsing [sent. 3078 len. 6]: I am an old man .
Parsing [sent. 3079 len. 11]: I have seen and I have -- I have thought .
Parsing [sent. 3080 len. 18]: And I tell you that only the real survives ; evil actions are some phantoms that disappear .
Parsing [sent. 3081 len. 7]: They must not trouble us . ''
Parsing [sent. 3082 len. 17]: `` That is a high plane , '' George intervened , and he spoke without sarcasm .
Parsing [sent. 3083 len. 68]: `` To put it roughly , these people have been asking more than the Harman estate is worth ; that was on the strength of the woman 's claim as a wife ; but now they know she is not one , her position is immensely strengthened , for she has only to go before the nearest Commissaire de Police -- '' `` Oh , no ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3084 len. 5]: Mrs. Harman cried passionately .
Parsing [sent. 3085 len. 7]: `` I have n't done THAT !
Parsing [sent. 3086 len. 8]: You must n't tell me I have .
Parsing [sent. 3087 len. 5]: You MUST N'T ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3088 len. 4]: `` Never ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3089 len. 3]: he answered .
Parsing [sent. 3090 len. 16]: `` There could not be a greater lie than to say you have done it .
Parsing [sent. 3091 len. 16]: The responsibility is with the wretched and vicious boy who brought the catastrophe upon himself .
Parsing [sent. 3092 len. 27]: But do n't you see that you 've got to keep out of it , that we 've got to take you out of it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3093 len. 5]: `` You ca n't !
Parsing [sent. 3094 len. 19]: I 'm part of it ; better or worse , it 's as much mine as his . ''
Parsing [sent. 3095 len. 6]: `` No , no ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3096 len. 4]: cried Miss Elizabeth .
Parsing [sent. 3097 len. 9]: `` YOU must n't tell us THAT ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3098 len. 14]: Still weeping , she sprang up and threw her arms about her brother .
Parsing [sent. 3099 len. 23]: `` It 's too horrible of you -- '' `` It is what I must tell you , '' Mrs. Harman said .
Parsing [sent. 3100 len. 9]: `` My separation from my husband is over .
Parsing [sent. 3101 len. 18]: I shall be with him now for -- '' `` I wo n't listen to you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3102 len. 23]: Miss Elizabeth lifted her wet face from George 's shoulder , and there was a note of deep anger in her voice .
Parsing [sent. 3103 len. 29]: `` You do n't know what you 're talking about ; you have n't the faintest idea of what a hideous situation that creature has made for himself .
Parsing [sent. 3104 len. 18]: Do n't you know that that awful woman was right , and there are laws in France ?
Parsing [sent. 3105 len. 25]: When she finds she ca n't get out of him all she wants , do you think she 's going to let him off ?
Parsing [sent. 3106 len. 16]: I suppose she struck you as being quite the sort who 'd prove nobly magnanimous !
Parsing [sent. 3107 len. 15]: Are you so blind you do n't see exactly what 's going to happen ?
Parsing [sent. 3108 len. 36]: She 'll ask twice as much now as she did before ; and the moment it 's clear that she is n't going to get it , she 'll call in an agent of police .
Parsing [sent. 3109 len. 18]: She 'll get her money in a separate suit and send him to prison to do it .
Parsing [sent. 3110 len. 17]: The case against him is positive ; there is n't a shadow of hope for him .
Parsing [sent. 3111 len. 16]: You talk of being with him ; do n't you see how preposterous that is ?
Parsing [sent. 3112 len. 12]: Do you imagine they encourage family housekeeping in French prisons ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3113 len. 11]: `` Oh , come , this wo n't do ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3114 len. 29]: The speaker was Cresson Ingle , who stepped forward , to my surprise ; for he had been hovering in the background wearing an expression of thorough discomfort .
Parsing [sent. 3115 len. 19]: `` You 're going much too far , '' he said , touching his betrothed upon the arm .
Parsing [sent. 3116 len. 22]: `` My dear Elizabeth , there is no use exaggerating ; the case is unpleasant enough just as it is . ''
Parsing [sent. 3117 len. 8]: `` In what have I exaggerated ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3118 len. 3]: she demanded .
Parsing [sent. 3119 len. 12]: `` Why , I KNEW Larrabee Harman , '' he returned .
Parsing [sent. 3120 len. 7]: `` I knew him fairly well .
Parsing [sent. 3121 len. 34]: I went as far as Honolulu with him , when he and some of his heelers started round the world ; and I remember that papers were served on him in San Francisco .
Parsing [sent. 3122 len. 14]: Mrs. Harman had made her application ; it was just before he sailed .
Parsing [sent. 3123 len. 18]: About a year and a half or two years later I met him again , in Paris .
Parsing [sent. 3124 len. 32]: He was in pretty bad shape ; seemed hypnotised by this Mariana and afraid as death of her ; she could go into a tantrum that would frighten him into anything .
Parsing [sent. 3125 len. 39]: It was a joke -- down along the line of the all-night dancers and cafes -- that she was going to marry him ; and some one told me afterward that she claimed to have brought it about .
Parsing [sent. 3126 len. 20]: I suppose it 's true ; but there is no question of his having married her in good faith .
Parsing [sent. 3127 len. 18]: He believed that the divorce had been granted ; he 'd offered no opposition to it whatever .
Parsing [sent. 3128 len. 29]: He was travelling continually , and I do n't think he knew much of what was going on , even right around him , most of the time .
Parsing [sent. 3129 len. 13]: He began with cognac and absinthe in the morning , you know .
Parsing [sent. 3130 len. 21]: For myself , I always supposed the suit had been carried through ; so did people generally , I think .
Parsing [sent. 3131 len. 57]: He 'll probably have to stand trial , and of course he 's technically guilty , but I do n't believe he 'd be convicted -- though I must say it would have been a most devilish good thing for him if he could have been got out of France before la Mursiana heard the truth .
Parsing [sent. 3132 len. 40]: Then he could have made terms with her safely at a distance -- she 'd have been powerless to injure him and would have precious soon come to time and been glad to take whatever he 'd give her .
Parsing [sent. 3133 len. 20]: NOW , I suppose , that 's impossible , and they 'll arrest him if he tries to budge .
Parsing [sent. 3134 len. 16]: But this talk of prison and all that is nonsense , my dear Elizabeth ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3135 len. 11]: `` You admit there is a chance of it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3136 len. 3]: she retorted .
Parsing [sent. 3137 len. 19]: `` I 've said all I had to say , '' returned Mr. Ingle with a dubious laugh .
Parsing [sent. 3138 len. 21]: `` And if you do n't mind , I believe I 'll wait for you outside , in the machine .
Parsing [sent. 3139 len. 9]: I want to look at the gear-box . ''
Parsing [sent. 3140 len. 47]: He paused , as if in deference to possible opposition , and , none being manifested , went hastily from the room with a sigh of relief , giving me , as he carefully closed the door , a glance of profound commiseration over his shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 3141 len. 46]: Miss Elizabeth had taken her brother 's hand , not with the effect of clinging for sympathy ; nor had her throwing her arms about him produced that effect ; one could as easily have imagined Brunhilda hiding her face in a man 's coat-lapels .
Parsing [sent. 3142 len. 19]: George 's sister wept , not weakly : she was on the defensive , but not for herself .
Parsing [sent. 3143 len. 37]: `` Does the fact that he may possibly escape going to prison '' -- she addressed her cousin -- `` make his position less scandalous , or can it make the man himself less detestable ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3144 len. 7]: Mrs. Harman looked at her steadily .
Parsing [sent. 3145 len. 8]: There was a long and sorrowful pause .
Parsing [sent. 3146 len. 20]: `` Nothing is changed , '' she said finally ; her eyes still fixed gravely on Miss Elizabeth 's .
Parsing [sent. 3147 len. 17]: At that , the other 's face flamed up , and she uttered a half-choked exclamation .
Parsing [sent. 3148 len. 22]: `` Oh , '' she cried -- `` you 've fallen in love with playing the martyr ; it 's SELF-love !
Parsing [sent. 3149 len. 7]: You SEE yourself in the role !
Parsing [sent. 3150 len. 29]: No one on earth could make me believe you 're in LOVE with this degraded imbecile -- all that 's left of the wreck of a vicious life !
Parsing [sent. 3151 len. 5]: It is n't that !
Parsing [sent. 3152 len. 39]: It 's because you want to make a shining example of yourself ; you want to get down on your knees and wash off the vileness from this befouled creature ; you want -- '' `` Madame ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3153 len. 13]: Keredec interrupted tremendously , `` you speak out of no knowledge ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3154 len. 17]: He leaned toward her across the table , which shook under the weight of his arms .
Parsing [sent. 3155 len. 22]: `` There is no vileness ; no one who is clean remains befouled because of the things that are gone . ''
Parsing [sent. 3156 len. 6]: `` They do not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3157 len. 21]: She laughed hysterically , and for my part , I sighed in despair -- for there was no stopping him .
Parsing [sent. 3158 len. 7]: `` They do not , indeed !
Parsing [sent. 3159 len. 14]: Do you know the relation of TIME to this little life of ours ?
Parsing [sent. 3160 len. 15]: We have only the present moment ; your consciousness of that is your existence .
Parsing [sent. 3161 len. 31]: Your knowledge of each present moment as it passes -- and it passes so swiftly that each word I speak now overlaps it -- yet it is all we have .
Parsing [sent. 3162 len. 28]: For all the rest , for what has gone by and what is yet coming -- THAT has no real existence ; it is all a dream .
Parsing [sent. 3163 len. 5]: It is not ALIVE .
Parsing [sent. 3164 len. 4]: It IS not !
Parsing [sent. 3165 len. 5]: It IS -- nothing !
Parsing [sent. 3166 len. 27]: So the soul that stands clean and pure to-day IS clean and pure -- and that is all there is to say about that soul ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3167 len. 28]: `` But a soul with evil tendencies , '' Ward began impatiently , `` if one must meet you on your own ground -- '' `` Ha !
Parsing [sent. 3168 len. 23]: my dear sir , those evil tendencies would be in the soiling memories , and my boy is free from them . ''
Parsing [sent. 3169 len. 10]: `` He went toward all that was soiling before .
Parsing [sent. 3170 len. 14]: Surely you ca n't pretend he may not take that direction again ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3171 len. 15]: `` That , '' returned the professor quickly , `` is his to choose .
Parsing [sent. 3172 len. 15]: If this lady can be with him now , he will choose right . ''
Parsing [sent. 3173 len. 4]: `` So ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3174 len. 17]: cried Miss Elizabeth , `` you offer her the role of a guide , do you ?
Parsing [sent. 3175 len. 34]: First she is to be his companion through a trial for bigamy in a French court , and , if he is acquitted , his nurse , teacher , and moral preceptor ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3176 len. 7]: She turned swiftly to her cousin .
Parsing [sent. 3177 len. 12]: `` That 's YOUR conception of a woman 's mission ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3178 len. 13]: `` I have n't any mission , '' Mrs. Harman answered quietly .
Parsing [sent. 3179 len. 25]: `` I 've never thought about missions ; I only know I belong to him ; that 's all I EVER thought about it .
Parsing [sent. 3180 len. 14]: I do n't pretend to explain it , or make it seem reasonable .
Parsing [sent. 3181 len. 22]: And when I met him again , here , it was -- it was -- it was proved to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3182 len. 4]: `` Proved ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3183 len. 5]: echoed Miss Elizabeth incredulously .
Parsing [sent. 3184 len. 17]: `` Yes ; proved as certainly as the sun shining proves that it 's day . ''
Parsing [sent. 3185 len. 7]: `` Will you tell us ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3186 len. 26]: It was I who asked the question : I spoke involuntarily , but she did not seem to think it strange that I should ask .
Parsing [sent. 3187 len. 37]: `` Oh , when I first met him , '' she said tremulously , `` I was frightened ; but it was not he who frightened me -- it was the rush of my own feeling .
Parsing [sent. 3188 len. 114]: I did not know what I felt , but I thought I might die , and he was so like himself as I had first known him -- but so changed , too ; there was something so wonderful about him , something that must make any stranger feel sorry for him , and yet it is beautiful -- '' She stopped for a moment and wiped her eyes , then went on bravely : `` And the next day he came , and waited for me -- I should have come here for him if he had n't -- and I fell in with the mistake he had made about my name .
Parsing [sent. 3189 len. 49]: You see , he 'd heard I was called ` Madame d'Armand , ' and I wanted him to keep on thinking that , for I thought if he knew I was Mrs. Harman he might find out -- '' She paused , her lip beginning to tremble .
Parsing [sent. 3190 len. 16]: `` Oh , do n't you see why I did n't want him to know ?
Parsing [sent. 3191 len. 19]: I did n't want him to suffer as he would -- as he does now , poor child !
Parsing [sent. 3192 len. 22]: -- but most of all I wanted -- I wanted to see if he would fall in love with me again !
Parsing [sent. 3193 len. 48]: I kept him from knowing , because , if he thought I was a stranger , and the same thing happened again -- his caring for me , I mean -- '' She had begun to weep now , freely and openly , but not from grief .
Parsing [sent. 3194 len. 4]: `` Oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3195 len. 17]: she cried , `` do n't you SEE how it 's all proven to me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3196 len. 10]: `` I see how it has deluded you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3197 len. 5]: said Miss Elizabeth vehemently .
Parsing [sent. 3198 len. 22]: `` I see what a rose-light it has thrown about this creature ; but it wo n't last , thank God !
Parsing [sent. 3199 len. 9]: any more than it did the other time .
Parsing [sent. 3200 len. 31]: The thing is for you to come to your senses before -- '' `` Ah , my dear , I have come to them at last and for ever ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3201 len. 21]: The words rang full and strong , though she was white and shaking , and heavy tears filled her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3202 len. 16]: `` I know what I am doing now , if I never knew before ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3203 len. 16]: `` You never did know -- '' Miss Ward began , but George stopped her .
Parsing [sent. 3204 len. 4]: `` Elizabeth ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3205 len. 4]: he said quickly .
Parsing [sent. 3206 len. 19]: `` We must n't go on like this ; it 's more than any of us can bear .
Parsing [sent. 3207 len. 17]: Come , let 's get out into the air ; let 's get back to Quesnay .
Parsing [sent. 3208 len. 16]: We 'll have Ingle drive us around the longer way , by the sea . ''
Parsing [sent. 3209 len. 6]: He turned to his cousin .
Parsing [sent. 3210 len. 8]: `` Louise , you 'll come now ?
Parsing [sent. 3211 len. 13]: If not , we 'll have to stay here with you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3212 len. 58]: `` I 'll come , '' she answered , trying bravely to stop the tears that kept rising in spite of her ; `` if you 'll wait till '' -- and suddenly she flashed through them a smile so charming that my heart ached the harder for George -- `` till I can stop crying ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3213 len. 16]: CHAPTER XXI Mr. Earl Percy and I sat opposite each other at dinner that evening .
Parsing [sent. 3214 len. 89]: Perhaps , for charity 's sake , I should add that though we faced each other , and , indeed , eyed each other solemnly at intervals , we partook not of the same repast , having each his own table ; his being set in the garden at his constant station near the gallery steps , and mine , some fifty feet distant , upon my own veranda , but moved out from behind the honeysuckle screen , for I sat alone and the night was warm .
Parsing [sent. 3215 len. 23]: To analyse my impression of Mr. Percy 's glances , I can not conscientiously record that I found favour in his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3216 len. 49]: For one thing , I fear he may not have recalled to his bosom a clarion sentiment -LRB- which doubtless he had ofttimes cheered from his native gallery in softer years -RRB- : the honourable declaration that many an honest heart beats beneath a poor man 's coat .
Parsing [sent. 3217 len. 67]: As for his own attire , he was even as the lilies of Quesnay ; that is to say , I beheld upon him the same formation of tie that I had seen there , the same sensuous beauty of the state waistcoat , though I think that his buttons were , if anything , somewhat spicier than those which had awed me at the chateau .
Parsing [sent. 3218 len. 45]: And when we simultaneously reached the fragrant hour of coffee , the cigarette case that glittered in his hand was one for which some lady-friend of his -LRB- I knew intuitively -RRB- must have given her All -- and then been left in debt .
Parsing [sent. 3219 len. 28]: Amedee had served us both ; Glouglou , as aforetime , attending the silent `` Grande Suite , '' where the curtains were once more tightly drawn .
Parsing [sent. 3220 len. 37]: Monsieur Rameau dined with his client in her own salon , evidently ; at least , Victorine , the femme de chambre , passed to and from the kitchen in that direction , bearing laden trays .
Parsing [sent. 3221 len. 56]: When Mr. Percy 's cigarette had been lighted , hesitation marked the manner of our maitre d'hotel ; plainly he wavered , but finally old custom prevailed ; abandoning the cigarette , he chose the cigar , and , hastily clearing my fashionable opponent 's table , approached the pavilion with his most conversational face .
Parsing [sent. 3222 len. 26]: I greeted him indifferently , but with hidden pleasure , for my soul -LRB- if Keredec is right and I have one -RRB- lay sorrowing .
Parsing [sent. 3223 len. 15]: I needed relief , and whatever else Amedee was , he was always that .
Parsing [sent. 3224 len. 21]: I spoke first : `` Amedee , how long a walk is it from Quesnay to Pere Baudry 's ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3225 len. 18]: `` Monsieur , about three-quarters of an hour for a good walker , one might say . ''
Parsing [sent. 3226 len. 20]: `` A long way for Jean Ferret to go for a cup of cider , '' I remarked musingly .
Parsing [sent. 3227 len. 3]: `` Eh ?
Parsing [sent. 3228 len. 6]: But why should he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3229 len. 4]: asked Amedee blankly .
Parsing [sent. 3230 len. 4]: `` Why indeed ?
Parsing [sent. 3231 len. 11]: Surely even a Norman gardener lives for more than cider !
Parsing [sent. 3232 len. 12]: You usually meet him there about noon , I believe ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3233 len. 31]: Methought he had the grace to blush , though there is an everlasting doubt in my mind that it may have been the colour of the candle-shade producing that illusion .
Parsing [sent. 3234 len. 45]: It was a strange thing to see , at all events , and , taking it for a physiological fact at the time , I let my willing eyes linger upon it as long as it -LRB- or its appearance -RRB- was upon him .
Parsing [sent. 3235 len. 20]: `` You were a little earlier than usual to-day , '' I continued finally , full of the marvel .
Parsing [sent. 3236 len. 4]: `` Monsieur ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3237 len. 6]: He was wholly blank again .
Parsing [sent. 3238 len. 8]: `` Were n't you there about eleven ?
Parsing [sent. 3239 len. 17]: Did n't you go about two hours after Mr. Ward and his friends left here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3240 len. 5]: He scratched his head .
Parsing [sent. 3241 len. 11]: `` I believe I had an errand in that direction .
Parsing [sent. 3242 len. 2]: Eh ?
Parsing [sent. 3243 len. 5]: Yes , I remember .
Parsing [sent. 3244 len. 9]: Truly , I think it so happened . ''
Parsing [sent. 3245 len. 9]: `` And you found Jean Ferret there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3246 len. 6]: `` Where , monsieur ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3247 len. 7]: `` At Pere Baudry 's . ''
Parsing [sent. 3248 len. 6]: `` No , monsieur . ''
Parsing [sent. 3249 len. 4]: `` What ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3250 len. 3]: I exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 3251 len. 6]: `` No , monsieur . ''
Parsing [sent. 3252 len. 7]: He was firm , somewhat reproachful .
Parsing [sent. 3253 len. 11]: `` You did n't see Jean Ferret this morning ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3254 len. 4]: `` Monsieur ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3255 len. 4]: `` Amedee ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3256 len. 14]: `` Eh , but I did not find him at Pere Baudry 's !
Parsing [sent. 3257 len. 20]: It may have happened that I stopped there , but he did not come until some time after . ''
Parsing [sent. 3258 len. 15]: `` After you had gone away from Pere Baudry 's , you mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3259 len. 10]: `` No , monsieur ; after I arrived there .
Parsing [sent. 3260 len. 3]: Truly . ''
Parsing [sent. 3261 len. 6]: `` Now we have it !
Parsing [sent. 3262 len. 14]: And you gave him the news of all that had happened here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3263 len. 4]: `` Monsieur ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3264 len. 11]: A world -- no , a constellation , a universe !
Parsing [sent. 3265 len. 8]: -- of reproach was in the word .
Parsing [sent. 3266 len. 11]: `` I retract the accusation , '' I said promptly .
Parsing [sent. 3267 len. 7]: `` I meant something else . ''
Parsing [sent. 3268 len. 20]: `` Upon everything that takes place at our hotel here , I am silent to all the world . ''
Parsing [sent. 3269 len. 6]: `` As the grave ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3270 len. 5]: I said with enthusiasm .
Parsing [sent. 3271 len. 10]: `` Truly -- that is a thing well known .
Parsing [sent. 3272 len. 6]: But Jean Ferret , then ?
Parsing [sent. 3273 len. 16]: He is not so discreet ; I have suspected that you are in his confidence .
Parsing [sent. 3274 len. 9]: At times you have even hinted as much .
Parsing [sent. 3275 len. 24]: Can you tell me if he saw the automobile of Monsieur Ingle when it came back to the chateau after leaving here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3276 len. 11]: `` It had arrived the moment before he departed . ''
Parsing [sent. 3277 len. 4]: `` Quite SO !
Parsing [sent. 3278 len. 37]: I understand , '' said I. `` He related to me that Mademoiselle Ward had the appearance of agitation , and Madame d'Armand that of pallor , which was also the case with Monsieur Ward . ''
Parsing [sent. 3279 len. 32]: `` Therefore , '' I said , `` Jean Ferret ran all the way to Pere Baudry 's to learn from you the reason for this agitation and this pallor ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3280 len. 12]: `` But , monsieur -- '' `` I retract again ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3281 len. 9]: I cut him off -- to save time .
Parsing [sent. 3282 len. 8]: `` What other news had he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3283 len. 36]: There came a gleam into his small , infolded eyes , a tiny glitter reflecting the mellow candle-light , but changing it , in that reflection , to a cold and sinister point of steel .
Parsing [sent. 3284 len. 17]: It should have warned me , but , as he paused , I repeated my question .
Parsing [sent. 3285 len. 25]: `` Monsieur , people say everything , '' he answered , frowning as if deploring what they said in some secret , particular instance .
Parsing [sent. 3286 len. 15]: `` The world is full of idle gossipers , tale-bearers , spreaders of scandal !
Parsing [sent. 3287 len. 23]: And , though I speak with perfect respect , all the people at the chateau are not perfect in such ways . ''
Parsing [sent. 3288 len. 8]: `` Do you mean the domestics ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3289 len. 5]: `` The visitors ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3290 len. 7]: `` What do they say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3291 len. 14]: `` Eh , well , then , they say -- but no ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3292 len. 9]: He contrived a masterly pretense of pained reluctance .
Parsing [sent. 3293 len. 19]: `` I can not -- '' `` Speak out , '' I commanded , piqued by his shilly-shallying .
Parsing [sent. 3294 len. 7]: `` What do they say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3295 len. 35]: `` Monsieur , it is about '' -- he shifted his weight from one leg to the other -- `` it is about -- about that beautiful Mademoiselle Elliott who sometimes comes here . ''
Parsing [sent. 3296 len. 36]: This was so far from what I had expected that I was surprised into a slight change of attitude , which all too plainly gratified him , though he made an effort to conceal it .
Parsing [sent. 3297 len. 20]: `` Well , '' I said uneasily , `` what do they find to say of Mademoiselle Elliott ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3298 len. 15]: `` They say that her painting is only a ruse to see monsieur . ''
Parsing [sent. 3299 len. 9]: `` To see Monsieur Saffren , yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 3300 len. 6]: `` But , no ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3301 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 3302 len. 18]: `` That is not -- '' `` Yes , it is , '' I assured him calmly .
Parsing [sent. 3303 len. 34]: `` As you know , Monsieur Saffren is very , very handsome , and Mademoiselle Elliott , being a painter , is naturally anxious to look at him from time to time . ''
Parsing [sent. 3304 len. 6]: `` You are sure ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3305 len. 7]: he said wistfully , even plaintively .
Parsing [sent. 3306 len. 13]: `` That is not the meaning Jean Ferret put upon it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3307 len. 6]: `` He was mistaken . ''
Parsing [sent. 3308 len. 25]: `` It may be , it may be , '' he returned , greatly crestfallen , picking up his tray and preparing to go .
Parsing [sent. 3309 len. 9]: `` But Jean Ferret was very positive . ''
Parsing [sent. 3310 len. 9]: `` And I am even more so ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3311 len. 45]: `` Then that malicious maid of Mademoiselle Ward 's was mistaken also , '' he sighed , `` when she said that now a marriage is to take place between Mademoiselle Ward and Monsieur Ingle -- '' `` Proceed , '' I bade him .
Parsing [sent. 3312 len. 9]: He moved a few feet nearer the kitchen .
Parsing [sent. 3313 len. 15]: `` The malicious woman said to Jean Ferret -- '' He paused and coughed .
Parsing [sent. 3314 len. 21]: `` It was in reference to those Italian jewels monsieur used to send -- '' `` What about them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3315 len. 4]: I asked ominously .
Parsing [sent. 3316 len. 27]: `` The woman says that Mademoiselle Ward -- '' he increased the distance between us -- `` that now she should give them to Mademoiselle Elliott !
Parsing [sent. 3317 len. 6]: GOOD night , monsieur ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3318 len. 8]: His entrance into the kitchen was precipitate .
Parsing [sent. 3319 len. 21]: I sank down again into the wicker chair -LRB- from which I had hastily risen -RRB- and contemplated the stars .
Parsing [sent. 3320 len. 28]: But the short reverie into which I then fell was interrupted by Mr. Percy , who , sauntering leisurely about the garden , paused to address me .
Parsing [sent. 3321 len. 20]: `` You folks thinks you was all to the gud , gittin ' them trunks off , what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3322 len. 18]: `` You speak in mysterious numbers , '' I returned , having no comprehension of his meaning .
Parsing [sent. 3323 len. 17]: `` I suppose you don ' know nothin ' about it , '' he laughed satirically .
Parsing [sent. 3324 len. 16]: `` You didn ' go over to Lisieux ` saft ` noon to ship 'em ?
Parsing [sent. 3325 len. 8]: Oh , no , not YOU ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3326 len. 13]: `` I went for a long walk this afternoon , Mr. Percy .
Parsing [sent. 3327 len. 15]: Naturally , I could n't have walked so far as Lisieux and back . ''
Parsing [sent. 3328 len. 58]: `` Luk here , m ` friend , '' he said sharply -- `` I reco ` nise ` at you 're tryin ' t ' play your own hand , but I ast you as man to man : DO you think you got any chanst t ' git that feller off t ' Paris ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3329 len. 10]: `` DO you think it will rain to-night ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3330 len. 3]: I inquired .
Parsing [sent. 3331 len. 25]: The light of a reflecting lamp which hung on the wall near the archway enabled me to perceive a bitter frown upon his forehead .
Parsing [sent. 3332 len. 53]: `` When a gen ` leman asts a question AS a gen ` leman , '' he said , his voice expressing a noble pathos , `` I ca n't see no call for no other gen ` leman to go an ' play the smart Aleck and not answer him . ''
Parsing [sent. 3333 len. 28]: In simple dignity he turned his back upon me and strolled to the other end of the courtyard , leaving me to the renewal of my reverie .
Parsing [sent. 3334 len. 7]: It was not a happy one .
Parsing [sent. 3335 len. 33]: My friends -- old and new -- I saw inextricably caught in a tangle of cross-purposes , miserably and hopelessly involved in a situation for which I could predict no possible relief .
Parsing [sent. 3336 len. 44]: I was able to understand now the beauty as well as the madness of Keredec 's plan ; and I had told him so -LRB- after the departure of the Quesnay party -RRB- , asking his pardon for my brusquerie of the morning .
Parsing [sent. 3337 len. 23]: But the towering edifice his hopes had erected was now tumbled about his ears : he had failed to elude the Mursiana .
Parsing [sent. 3338 len. 13]: There could be no doubt of her absolute control of the situation .
Parsing [sent. 3339 len. 16]: THAT was evident in the every step of the youth now confidently parading before me .
Parsing [sent. 3340 len. 40]: Following his active stride with my eye , I observed him in the act of saluting , with a gracious nod of his bare head , some one , invisible to me , who was approaching from the road .
Parsing [sent. 3341 len. 56]: Immediately after -- and altogether with the air of a person merely `` happening in '' -- a slight figure , clad in a long coat , a short skirt , and a broad-brimmed , veil-bound brown hat , sauntered casually through the archway and came into full view in the light of the reflector .
Parsing [sent. 3342 len. 25]: I sprang to my feet and started toward her , uttering an exclamation which I was unable to stifle , though I tried to .
Parsing [sent. 3343 len. 12]: `` Good evening , Mr. Percy , '' she said cheerily .
Parsing [sent. 3344 len. 8]: `` It 's the most EXUBERANT night .
Parsing [sent. 3345 len. 9]: YOU 'RE quite hearty , I hope ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3346 len. 19]: `` Takin ' a walk , I see , little lady , '' he observed with genial patronage .
Parsing [sent. 3347 len. 12]: `` Oh , not just for that , '' she returned .
Parsing [sent. 3348 len. 9]: `` It 's more to see HIM . ''
Parsing [sent. 3349 len. 19]: She nodded to me , and , as I reached her , carelessly gave me her left hand .
Parsing [sent. 3350 len. 23]: `` You know I 'm studying with him , '' she continued to Mr. Percy , exhibiting a sketch-book under her arm .
Parsing [sent. 3351 len. 10]: `` I dropped over to get a criticism . ''
Parsing [sent. 3352 len. 9]: `` Oh , drawin ' - lessons ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3353 len. 5]: said Mr. Percy tolerantly .
Parsing [sent. 3354 len. 12]: `` Well , don ' lem me interrup ' ye . ''
Parsing [sent. 3355 len. 18]: He moved as if to withdraw toward the steps , but she detained him with a question .
Parsing [sent. 3356 len. 12]: `` You 're spending the rest of the summer here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3357 len. 9]: `` That depends , '' he answered tersely .
Parsing [sent. 3358 len. 11]: `` I hear you have some PASSIONATELY interesting friends . ''
Parsing [sent. 3359 len. 8]: `` Where did you hear that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3360 len. 9]: `` Ah , do n't you know ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3361 len. 4]: she responded commiseratingly .
Parsing [sent. 3362 len. 11]: `` This is the most scandalously gossipy neighbourhood in France .
Parsing [sent. 3363 len. 20]: My DEAR young man , every one from here to Timbuctu knows all about it by this time ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3364 len. 6]: `` All about what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3365 len. 31]: `` About the excitement you 're such a VALUABLE part of ; about your wonderful Spanish friend and how she claims the strange young man here for her husband . ''
Parsing [sent. 3366 len. 28]: `` They 'll know more 'n that , I expec ' , '' he returned with a side glance at me , `` before VERY long . ''
Parsing [sent. 3367 len. 28]: `` Every one thinks _ I _ am so interesting , '' she rattled on artlessly , `` because I happened to meet YOU in the woods .
Parsing [sent. 3368 len. 9]: I 've held quite a levee all day .
Parsing [sent. 3369 len. 28]: In a reflected way it makes a heroine of me , you see , because you are one of the very MOST prominent figures in it all .
Parsing [sent. 3370 len. 30]: I hope you wo n't think I 've been too bold , '' she pursued anxiously , `` in claiming that I really am one of your acquaintances ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3371 len. 13]: `` That 'll be all right , '' he politely assured her .
Parsing [sent. 3372 len. 7]: `` I am so glad . ''
Parsing [sent. 3373 len. 6]: Her laughter rang out gaily .
Parsing [sent. 3374 len. 27]: `` Because I 've been talking about you as if we were the OLDEST friends , and I 'd hate to have them find me out .
Parsing [sent. 3375 len. 53]: I 've told them everything -- about your appearance you see , and how your hair was parted , and how you were dressed , and -- '' `` Luk here , '' he interrupted , suddenly discharging his Bowery laugh , `` did you tell 'em how HE was dressed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3376 len. 8]: He pointed a jocular finger at me .
Parsing [sent. 3377 len. 11]: `` That WUD ` a ' made a hit ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3378 len. 11]: `` No ; we were n't talking of him . ''
Parsing [sent. 3379 len. 4]: `` Why not ?
Parsing [sent. 3380 len. 7]: He 's in it , too .
Parsing [sent. 3381 len. 9]: Bullieve me , he THINKS he is ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3382 len. 9]: `` In the excitement , you mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3383 len. 4]: `` Right ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3384 len. 5]: said Mr. Percy amiably .
Parsing [sent. 3385 len. 40]: `` He goes round holdin ' Rip Van Winkle Keredec 's hand when the ole man 's cryin ' ; helpin ' him sneak his trunks off t ' Paris -- playin ' the hired man gener ` ly .
Parsing [sent. 3386 len. 15]: Oh , he thinks he 's quite the boy , in this trouble ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3387 len. 20]: `` I 'm afraid it 's a small part , '' she returned , `` compared to yours . ''
Parsing [sent. 3388 len. 13]: `` Oh , I hold my end up , I guess . ''
Parsing [sent. 3389 len. 21]: `` I should think you 'd be so worn out and sleepy you could n't hold your head up ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3390 len. 3]: `` Who ?
Parsing [sent. 3391 len. 2]: ME ?
Parsing [sent. 3392 len. 11]: Not t ' - night , m ` little friend .
Parsing [sent. 3393 len. 19]: I tuk MY sleep 's aft ` noon and let Rameau do the Sherlock a little while . ''
Parsing [sent. 3394 len. 8]: She gazed upon him with unconcealed admiration .
Parsing [sent. 3395 len. 15]: `` You are wonderful , '' she sighed faintly , and `` WONDERFUL ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3396 len. 4]: she breathed again .
Parsing [sent. 3397 len. 33]: `` How prosaic are drawing-lessons , '' she continued , touching my arm and moving with me toward the pavilion , `` after listening to a man of action like that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3398 len. 34]: Mr. Percy , establishing himself comfortably in a garden chair at the foot of the gallery steps , was heard to utter a short cough as he renewed the light of his cigarette .
Parsing [sent. 3399 len. 23]: My visitor paused upon my veranda , humming , `` Quand l'Amour Meurt '' while I went within and lit a lamp .
Parsing [sent. 3400 len. 10]: `` Shall I bring the light out there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3401 len. 16]: I asked , but , turning , found that she was already in the room .
Parsing [sent. 3402 len. 30]: `` The sketch-book is my duenna , '' she said , sinking into a chair upon one side of the centre table , upon which I placed the lamp .
Parsing [sent. 3403 len. 11]: `` Lessons are unquestionable , at any place or time .
Parsing [sent. 3404 len. 6]: Behold the beautiful posies ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3405 len. 26]: She spread the book open on the table between us , as I seated myself opposite her , revealing some antique coloured smudges of flowers .
Parsing [sent. 3406 len. 5]: `` Elegancies of Eighteen-Forty !
Parsing [sent. 3407 len. 18]: Is n't that a survival of the period when young ladies had ` accomplishments , ' though !
Parsing [sent. 3408 len. 17]: I found it at the chateau and -- '' `` Never mind , '' I said .
Parsing [sent. 3409 len. 21]: `` Do n't you know that you ca n't ramble over the country alone at this time of night ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3410 len. 80]: `` If you speak any louder , '' she said , with some urgency of manner , `` you 'll be ` hopelessly compromised socially , ' as Mrs. Alderman McGinnis and the Duchess of Gwythyl-Corners say '' -- she directed my glance , by one of her own , through the open door to Mr. Percy -- `` because HE 'LL hear you and know that the sketch-book was only a shallow pretext of mine to see you .
Parsing [sent. 3411 len. 15]: Do be a little manfully self-contained , or you 'll get us talked about !
Parsing [sent. 3412 len. 20]: And as for ` this time of night , ' I believe it 's almost half past nine . ''
Parsing [sent. 3413 len. 14]: `` Does Miss Ward know -- '' `` Do you think it likely ?
Parsing [sent. 3414 len. 23]: One of the most convenient things about a chateau is the number of ways to get out of it without being seen .
Parsing [sent. 3415 len. 7]: I had a choice of eight .
Parsing [sent. 3416 len. 26]: So I ` suffered fearfully from neuralgia , ' dined in my own room , and sped through the woods to my honest forester . ''
Parsing [sent. 3417 len. 4]: She nodded brightly .
Parsing [sent. 3418 len. 6]: `` That 's YOU ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3419 len. 13]: `` You were n't afraid to come through the woods alone ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3420 len. 15]: I asked , uncomfortably conscious that her gaiety met a dull response from me .
Parsing [sent. 3421 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 3422 len. 26]: `` But if Miss Ward finds that you 're not at the chateau -- '' `` She wo n't ; she thinks I 'm asleep .
Parsing [sent. 3423 len. 9]: She brought me up a sleeping-powder herself . ''
Parsing [sent. 3424 len. 8]: `` She thinks you took it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3425 len. 11]: `` She KNOWS I did , '' said Miss Elliott .
Parsing [sent. 3426 len. 7]: `` I 'm full of it !
Parsing [sent. 3427 len. 19]: And that will be the reason -- if you notice that I 'm particularly nervous or excited . ''
Parsing [sent. 3428 len. 24]: `` You seem all of that , '' I said , looking at her eyes , which were very wide and very brilliant .
Parsing [sent. 3429 len. 10]: `` However , I believe you always do . ''
Parsing [sent. 3430 len. 4]: `` Ah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3431 len. 3]: she smiled .
Parsing [sent. 3432 len. 11]: `` I knew you thought me atrocious from the first .
Parsing [sent. 3433 len. 13]: You find MYRIADS of objections to me , do n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3434 len. 16]: I had forgotten to look away from her eyes , and I kept on forgetting .
Parsing [sent. 3435 len. 35]: -LRB- The same thing had happened several times lately ; and each time , by a somewhat painful coincidence , I remembered my age at precisely the instant I remembered to look away . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 3436 len. 23]: `` Dazzling '' is a good old-fashioned word for eyes like hers ; at least it might define their effect on me .
Parsing [sent. 3437 len. 30]: `` If I did manage to object to you , '' I said slowly , `` it would be a good thing for me -- would n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3438 len. 8]: `` Oh , I 've WON ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3439 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 3440 len. 4]: `` Won ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3441 len. 3]: I echoed .
Parsing [sent. 3442 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 3443 len. 36]: I laid a wager with myself that I 'd have a pretty speech from you before I went out of your life '' -- she checked a laugh , and concluded thrillingly -- `` forever !
Parsing [sent. 3444 len. 6]: I leave Quesnay to-morrow ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3445 len. 9]: `` Your father has returned from America ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3446 len. 10]: `` Oh dear , no , '' she murmured .
Parsing [sent. 3447 len. 11]: `` I 'll be quite at the world 's mercy .
Parsing [sent. 3448 len. 16]: I must go up to Paris and retire from public life until he does come .
Parsing [sent. 3449 len. 14]: I shall take the vows -- in some obscure but respectable pension . ''
Parsing [sent. 3450 len. 14]: `` You ca n't endure the life at the chateau any longer ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3451 len. 9]: `` It wo n't endure ME any longer .
Parsing [sent. 3452 len. 19]: If I should n't go to-morrow I 'd be put out , I think -- after to-night ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3453 len. 13]: `` But you intimated that no one would know about to-night ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3454 len. 13]: `` The night is n't over yet , '' she replied enigmatically .
Parsing [sent. 3455 len. 28]: `` It almost is -- for you , '' I said ; `` because in ten minutes I shall take you back to the chateau gates . ''
Parsing [sent. 3456 len. 19]: She offered no comment on this prophecy , but gazed at me thoughtfully and seriously for several moments .
Parsing [sent. 3457 len. 34]: `` I suppose you can imagine , '' she said , in a tone that threatened to become tremulous , `` what sort of an afternoon we 've been having up there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3458 len. 9]: `` Has it been -- '' I began .
Parsing [sent. 3459 len. 5]: `` Oh , heart-breaking !
Parsing [sent. 3460 len. 25]: Louise came to my room as soon as they got back from here , this morning , and told me the whole pitiful story .
Parsing [sent. 3461 len. 14]: But they did n't let her stay there long , poor woman ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3462 len. 4]: `` They ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3463 len. 3]: I asked .
Parsing [sent. 3464 len. 8]: `` Oh , Elizabeth and her brother .
Parsing [sent. 3465 len. 13]: They 've been at her all afternoon -- off and on . ''
Parsing [sent. 3466 len. 6]: `` To do what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3467 len. 12]: `` To ` save herself , ' so they call it .
Parsing [sent. 3468 len. 13]: They 're insisting that she must not see her poor husband again .
Parsing [sent. 3469 len. 20]: They 're DETERMINED she sha 'n' t. '' `` But George would n't worry her , '' I objected .
Parsing [sent. 3470 len. 8]: `` Oh , would n't he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3471 len. 5]: The girl laughed sadly .
Parsing [sent. 3472 len. 38]: `` I do n't suppose he could help it , he 's in such a state himself , but between him and Elizabeth it 's hard to see how poor Mrs. Harman lived through the day . ''
Parsing [sent. 3473 len. 19]: `` Well , '' I said slowly , `` I do n't see that they 're not right .
Parsing [sent. 3474 len. 40]: She ought to be kept out of all this as much as possible ; and if her husband has to go through a trial -- '' `` I want you to tell me something , '' Miss Elliott interrupted .
Parsing [sent. 3475 len. 10]: `` How much do you like Mr. Ward ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3476 len. 7]: `` He 's an old friend .
Parsing [sent. 3477 len. 19]: I suppose I like my old friends in about the same way that other people like theirs . ''
Parsing [sent. 3478 len. 15]: `` How much do you like Mr. Saffren -- I mean Mr. Harman ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3479 len. 6]: `` Oh , THAT ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3480 len. 3]: I groaned .
Parsing [sent. 3481 len. 32]: `` If I could still call him ` Oliver Saffren , ' if I could still think of him as ` Oliver Saffren , ' it would be easy to answer .
Parsing [sent. 3482 len. 15]: I never was so ` drawn ' to a man in my life before .
Parsing [sent. 3483 len. 17]: But when I think of him as Larrabee Harman , I am full of misgivings . ''
Parsing [sent. 3484 len. 21]: `` Louise is n't , '' she put in eagerly , and with something oddly like the manner of argument .
Parsing [sent. 3485 len. 7]: `` His wife is n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3486 len. 6]: `` Oh , I know .
Parsing [sent. 3487 len. 14]: Perhaps one reason is that she never saw him at quite his worst .
Parsing [sent. 3488 len. 3]: I did .
Parsing [sent. 3489 len. 56]: I had only two glimpses of him -- of the briefest -- but they inspired me with such a depth of dislike that I ca n't tell you how painful it was to discover that ` Oliver Saffren ' -- this strange , pathetic , attractive FRIEND of mine -- is the same man . ''
Parsing [sent. 3490 len. 9]: `` Oh , but he is n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3491 len. 4]: she exclaimed quickly .
Parsing [sent. 3492 len. 11]: `` Keredec says he is , '' I laughed helplessly .
Parsing [sent. 3493 len. 16]: `` So does Louise , '' returned Miss Elliott , disdaining consistency in her eagerness .
Parsing [sent. 3494 len. 18]: `` And she 's right -- and she cares more for him than she ever did ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3495 len. 7]: `` I suppose she does . ''
Parsing [sent. 3496 len. 20]: `` Are you -- '' the girl began , then stopped for a moment , looking at me steadily .
Parsing [sent. 3497 len. 12]: `` Are n't you a little in love with her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3498 len. 8]: `` Yes , '' I answered honestly .
Parsing [sent. 3499 len. 6]: `` Are n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3500 len. 10]: `` THAT 'S what I wanted to know ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3501 len. 29]: she said ; and as she turned a page in the sketch-book for the benefit of Mr. Percy , I saw that her hand had begun to tremble .
Parsing [sent. 3502 len. 4]: `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3503 len. 10]: I asked , leaning toward her across the table .
Parsing [sent. 3504 len. 54]: `` Because , if she were involved in some undertaking -- something that , if it went wrong , would endanger her happiness and , I think , even her life -- for it might actually kill her if she failed , and brought on a worse catastrophe -- '' `` Yes ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3505 len. 9]: I said anxiously , as she paused again .
Parsing [sent. 3506 len. 7]: `` You 'd help her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3507 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 3508 len. 10]: `` I would indeed , '' I assented earnestly .
Parsing [sent. 3509 len. 16]: `` I told her once I 'd do anything in the world for her . ''
Parsing [sent. 3510 len. 16]: `` Even if it involved something that George Ward might never forgive you for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3511 len. 20]: `` I said , ` anything in the world , ' '' I returned , perhaps a little huskily .
Parsing [sent. 3512 len. 7]: `` I meant all of that .
Parsing [sent. 3513 len. 16]: If there is anything she wants me to do , I shall do it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3514 len. 13]: She gave a low cry of triumph , but immediately checked it .
Parsing [sent. 3515 len. 70]: Then she leaned far over the table , her face close above the book , and , tracing the outline of an uncertain lily with her small , brown-gloved forefinger , as though she were consulting me on the drawing , `` I was n't afraid to come through the woods alone , '' she said , in a very low voice , `` because I was n't alone .
Parsing [sent. 3516 len. 6]: Louise came with me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3517 len. 4]: `` What ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3518 len. 3]: I gasped .
Parsing [sent. 3519 len. 6]: `` Where is she ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3520 len. 9]: `` At the Baudry cottage down the road .
Parsing [sent. 3521 len. 50]: They wo n't miss her at the chateau until morning ; I locked her door on the outside , and if they go to bother her again -- though I do n't think they will -- they 'll believe she 's fastened it on the inside and is asleep .
Parsing [sent. 3522 len. 42]: She managed to get a note to Keredec late this afternoon ; it explained everything , and he had some trunks carried out the rear gate of the inn and carted over to Lisieux to be shipped to Paris from there .
Parsing [sent. 3523 len. 39]: It is to be supposed -- or hoped , at least -- that this woman and her people will believe THAT means Professor Keredec and Mr. Harman will try to get to Paris in the same way . ''
Parsing [sent. 3524 len. 17]: `` So , '' I said , `` that 's what Percy meant about the trunks .
Parsing [sent. 3525 len. 6]: I did n't understand . ''
Parsing [sent. 3526 len. 20]: `` He 's on watch , you see , '' she continued , turning a page to another drawing .
Parsing [sent. 3527 len. 18]: `` He means to sit up all night , or he would n't have slept this afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 3528 len. 19]: He 's not precisely the kind to be in the habit of afternoon naps -- Mr. Percy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3529 len. 4]: She laughed nervously .
Parsing [sent. 3530 len. 15]: `` That 's why it 's almost absolutely necessary for us to have you .
Parsing [sent. 3531 len. 15]: If we have -- the thing is so simple that it 's certain . ''
Parsing [sent. 3532 len. 9]: `` If you have me for what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3533 len. 3]: I asked .
Parsing [sent. 3534 len. 37]: `` If you 'll help '' -- and , as she looked up , her eyes , now very close to mine , were dazzling indeed -- `` I 'll adore you for ever and ever !
Parsing [sent. 3535 len. 12]: Oh , MUCH longer than you 'd like me to ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3536 len. 27]: `` You mean she 's going to -- '' `` I mean that she 's going to run away with him again , '' she whispered .
Parsing [sent. 3537 len. 38]: CHAPTER XXII At midnight there was no mistaking the palpable uneasiness with which Mr. Percy , faithful sentry , regarded the behaviour of Miss Elliott and myself as we sat conversing upon the veranda of the pavilion .
Parsing [sent. 3538 len. 52]: It was not fear for the security of his prisoner which troubled him , but the unseemliness of the young woman 's persistence in remaining to this hour under an espionage no more matronly than that of a sketch-book abandoned on the table when we had come out to the open .
Parsing [sent. 3539 len. 63]: The youth had veiled his splendours with more splendour : a long overcoat of so glorious a plaid it paled the planets above us ; and he wandered restlessly about the garden in this refulgence , glancing at us now and then with what , in spite of the insufficient revelation of the starlight , we both recognised as a chilling disapproval .
Parsing [sent. 3540 len. 14]: The lights of the inn were all out ; the courtyard was dark .
Parsing [sent. 3541 len. 49]: The Spanish woman and Monsieur Rameau had made their appearance for a moment , half an hour earlier , to exchange a word with their fellow vigilant , and , soon after , the extinguishing of the lamps in their respective apartments denoted their retirement for the night .
Parsing [sent. 3542 len. 16]: In the `` Grande Suite '' all had been dark and silent for an hour .
Parsing [sent. 3543 len. 45]: About the whole place the only sign of life , aside from those signs furnished by our three selves , was a rhythmical sound from an open window near the kitchen , where incontrovertibly slumbered our maitre d'hotel after the cares of the day .
Parsing [sent. 3544 len. 20]: Upon the occasion of our forest meeting Mr. Percy had signified his desire to hear some talk of Art .
Parsing [sent. 3545 len. 33]: I think he had his fill to-night -- and more ; for that was the subject chosen by my dashing companion , and vivaciously exploited until our awaited hour was at hand .
Parsing [sent. 3546 len. 21]: Heaven knows what nonsense I prattled , I do not ; I do not think I knew at the time .
Parsing [sent. 3547 len. 13]: I talked mechanically , trying hard not to betray my increasing excitement .
Parsing [sent. 3548 len. 40]: Under cover of this traduction of the Muse I served , I kept going over and over the details of Louise Harman 's plan , as the girl beside me had outlined it , bending above the smudgy sketch-book .
Parsing [sent. 3549 len. 24]: `` To make them think the flight is for Paris , '' she had urged , `` to Paris by way of Lisieux .
Parsing [sent. 3550 len. 34]: To make that man yonder believe that it is toward Lisieux , while they turn at the crossroads , and drive across the country to Trouville for the morning boat to Havre . ''
Parsing [sent. 3551 len. 10]: It was simple ; that was its great virtue .
Parsing [sent. 3552 len. 52]: If they were well started , they were safe ; and well started meant only that Larrabee Harman should leave the inn without an alarm , for an alarm sounded too soon meant `` racing and chasing on Canoby Lea , '' before they could get out of the immediate neighbourhood .
Parsing [sent. 3553 len. 63]: But with two hours ' start , and the pursuit spending most of its energy in the wrong direction -- that is , toward Lisieux and Paris -- they would be on the deck of the French-Canadian liner to-morrow noon , sailing out of the harbour of Le Havre , with nothing but the Atlantic Ocean between them and the St. Lawrence .
Parsing [sent. 3554 len. 43]: I thought of the woman who dared this flight for her lover , of the woman who came full-armed between him and the world , a Valkyr winging down to bear him away to a heaven she would make for him herself .
Parsing [sent. 3555 len. 22]: Gentle as she was , there must have been a Valkyr in her somewhere , or she could not attempt this .
Parsing [sent. 3556 len. 28]: She swept in , not only between him and the world , but between him and the destroying demons his own sins had raised to beset him .
Parsing [sent. 3557 len. 22]: There , I thought , was a whole love ; or there she was not only wife but mother to him .
Parsing [sent. 3558 len. 42]: And I remembered the dream of her I had before I ever saw her , on that first night after I came down to Normandy , when Amedee 's talk of `` Madame d'Armand '' had brought her into my thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 3559 len. 22]: I remembered that I had dreamed of finding her statue , but it was veiled and I could not uncover it .
Parsing [sent. 3560 len. 28]: And to-night it seemed to me that the veil had lifted , and the statue was a figure of Mercy in the beautiful likeness of Louise Harman .
Parsing [sent. 3561 len. 28]: Then Keredec was wrong , optimist as he was , since a will such as hers could save him she loved , even from his own acts .
Parsing [sent. 3562 len. 89]: `` And when you come to Monticelli 's first style -- '' Miss Elliott 's voice rose a little , and I caught the sound of a new thrill vibrating in it -- `` you find a hundred others of his epoch doing it quite as well , not a BIT of a bit less commonplace -- '' She broke off suddenly , and looking up , as I had fifty times in the last twenty minutes , I saw that a light shone from Keredec 's window .
Parsing [sent. 3563 len. 14]: `` I dare say they ARE commonplace , '' I remarked , rising .
Parsing [sent. 3564 len. 21]: `` But now , if you will permit me , I 'll offer you my escort back to Quesnay . ''
Parsing [sent. 3565 len. 23]: I went into my room , put on my cap , lit a lantern , and returned with it to the veranda .
Parsing [sent. 3566 len. 7]: `` If you are ready ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3567 len. 3]: I said .
Parsing [sent. 3568 len. 20]: `` Oh , quite , '' she answered , and we crossed the garden as far as the steps .
Parsing [sent. 3569 len. 6]: Mr. Percy signified his approval .
Parsing [sent. 3570 len. 12]: `` Gunna see the little lady home , are you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3571 len. 4]: he said graciously .
Parsing [sent. 3572 len. 15]: `` I was THINKIN ' it was about time , m ` self ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3573 len. 39]: The salon door of the `` Grand Suite '' opened , above me , and at the sound , the youth started , springing back to see what it portended , but I ran quickly up the steps .
Parsing [sent. 3574 len. 36]: Keredec stood in the doorway , bare-headed and in his shirt-sleeves ; in one hand he held a travelling-bag , which he immediately gave me , setting his other for a second upon my shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 3575 len. 30]: `` Thank you , my good , good friend , '' he said with an emotion in his big voice which made me glad of what I was doing .
Parsing [sent. 3576 len. 25]: He went back into the room , closing the door , and I descended the steps as rapidly as I had run up them .
Parsing [sent. 3577 len. 17]: Without pausing , I started for the rear of the courtyard , Miss Elliott accompanying me .
Parsing [sent. 3578 len. 13]: The sentry had watched these proceedings open-mouthed , more mystified than alarmed .
Parsing [sent. 3579 len. 19]: `` Luk here , '' he said , `` I want t ' know whut this means . ''
Parsing [sent. 3580 len. 21]: `` Anything you choose to think it means , '' I laughed , beginning to walk a little more rapidly .
Parsing [sent. 3581 len. 25]: He glanced up at the windows of the `` Grande Suite , '' which were again dark , and began to follow us slowly .
Parsing [sent. 3582 len. 9]: `` What you gut in that grip ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3583 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 3584 len. 13]: `` You do n't think we 're carrying off Mr. Harman ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3585 len. 24]: `` I reckon HE 'S in his room all right , '' said the youth grimly ; `` unless he 's FLEW out .
Parsing [sent. 3586 len. 15]: But I want t ' know what you think y 're doin ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3587 len. 16]: `` Just now , '' I replied , `` I 'm opening this door . ''
Parsing [sent. 3588 len. 9]: This was a fact he could not question .
Parsing [sent. 3589 len. 41]: We emerged at the foot of a lane behind the inn ; it was long and narrow , bordered by stone walls , and at the other end debouched upon a road which passed the rear of the Baudry cottage .
Parsing [sent. 3590 len. 12]: Miss Elliott took my arm , and we entered the lane .
Parsing [sent. 3591 len. 5]: Mr. Percy paused undecidedly .
Parsing [sent. 3592 len. 15]: `` I want t ' know whut you think y 're doin ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3593 len. 8]: he repeated angrily , calling after us .
Parsing [sent. 3594 len. 12]: `` It 's very simple , '' I called in turn .
Parsing [sent. 3595 len. 11]: `` Ca n't I do an errand for a friend ?
Parsing [sent. 3596 len. 21]: Ca n't I even carry his travelling-bag for him , without going into explanations to everybody I happen to meet ?
Parsing [sent. 3597 len. 26]: And , '' I added , permitting some anxiety to be marked in my voice , `` I think you may as well go back .
Parsing [sent. 3598 len. 12]: We 're not going far enough to need a guard . ''
Parsing [sent. 3599 len. 17]: Mr. Percy allowed an oath to escape him , and we heard him muttering to himself .
Parsing [sent. 3600 len. 7]: Then his foot-steps sounded behind us .
Parsing [sent. 3601 len. 6]: `` He 's coming ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3602 len. 13]: Miss Elliott whispered , with nervous exultation , looking over her shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 3603 len. 8]: `` He 's going to follow . ''
Parsing [sent. 3604 len. 10]: `` He was sure to , '' said I .
Parsing [sent. 3605 len. 15]: We trudged briskly on , followed at some fifty paces by the perturbed watchman .
Parsing [sent. 3606 len. 17]: Presently I heard my companion utter a sigh so profound that it was a whispered moan .
Parsing [sent. 3607 len. 6]: `` What is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3608 len. 3]: I murmured .
Parsing [sent. 3609 len. 18]: `` Oh , it 's the thought of Quesnay and to-morrow ; facing them with THIS ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3610 len. 3]: she quavered .
Parsing [sent. 3611 len. 29]: `` Louise has written a letter for me to give them , but I 'll have to tell them -- '' `` Not alone , '' I whispered .
Parsing [sent. 3612 len. 17]: `` I 'll be there when you come down from your room in the morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 3613 len. 58]: We were embarked upon a singular adventure , not unattended by a certain danger ; we were tingling with a hundred apprehensions , occupied with the vital necessity of drawing the little spy after us -- and that was a strange moment for a man -LRB- and an elderly painter-man of no mark , at that ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 3614 len. 19]: to hear himself called what I was called then , in a tremulous whisper close to my ear .
Parsing [sent. 3615 len. 27]: Of course she has denied it since ; nevertheless , she said it -- twice , for I pretended not to hear her the first time .
Parsing [sent. 3616 len. 74]: I made no answer , for something in the word she called me , and in her seeming to mean it , made me choke up so that I could not even whisper ; but I made up my mind that , after THAT if this girl saw Mr. Earl Percy on his way back to the inn before she wished him to go , it would be because he had killed me .
Parsing [sent. 3617 len. 21]: We were near the end of the lane when the neigh of a horse sounded sonorously from the road beyond .
Parsing [sent. 3618 len. 11]: Mr. Percy came running up swiftly and darted by us .
Parsing [sent. 3619 len. 6]: `` Who 's that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3620 len. 4]: he called loudly .
Parsing [sent. 3621 len. 10]: `` Who 's that in the cart yonder ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3622 len. 38]: I set my lantern on the ground close to the wall , and at the same moment a horse and cart drew up on the road at the end of the lane , showing against the starlight .
Parsing [sent. 3623 len. 21]: It was Pere Baudry 's best horse , a stout gray , that would easily enough make Trouville by daylight .
Parsing [sent. 3624 len. 29]: A woman 's figure and a man 's -LRB- the latter that of Pere Baudry himself -RRB- could be made out dimly on the seat of the cart .
Parsing [sent. 3625 len. 9]: `` Who is it , I say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3626 len. 5]: shouted our excited friend .
Parsing [sent. 3627 len. 18]: `` What kind of a game d'ye think y 're puttin ' up on me here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3628 len. 19]: He set his hand on the side of the cart and sprang upon the hub of the wheel .
Parsing [sent. 3629 len. 8]: A glance at the occupants satisfied him .
Parsing [sent. 3630 len. 5]: `` Mrs. Harman ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3631 len. 3]: he yelled .
Parsing [sent. 3632 len. 5]: `` Mrs. Harman ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3633 len. 7]: He leaped down into the road .
Parsing [sent. 3634 len. 16]: `` I knowed I was a fool to come away without wakin ' up Rameau .
Parsing [sent. 3635 len. 9]: But you have n't beat us yet ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3636 len. 16]: He drove back into the lane , but just inside its entrance I met him .
Parsing [sent. 3637 len. 7]: `` Where are you going ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3638 len. 3]: I asked .
Parsing [sent. 3639 len. 9]: `` Back to the pigeon-house in a hurry .
Parsing [sent. 3640 len. 10]: There 's devilment here , and I want Rameau .
Parsing [sent. 3641 len. 8]: Git out o ' my way ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3642 len. 18]: `` You 're not going back , '' said I. `` The hell I ai n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3643 len. 4]: said Mr. Percy .
Parsing [sent. 3644 len. 21]: `` I give ye two seconds t ' git out o ' my -- TAKE YER HANDS OFFA ME ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3645 len. 42]: I made sure of my grip , not upon the refulgent overcoat , for I feared he might slip out of that , but upon the collars of his coat and waistcoat , which I clenched together in my right hand .
Parsing [sent. 3646 len. 45]: I knew that he was quick , and I suspected that he was `` scientific , '' but I did it before he had finished talking , and so made fast , with my mind and heart and soul set upon sticking to him .
Parsing [sent. 3647 len. 12]: My suspicions as to his `` science '' were perfervidly justified .
Parsing [sent. 3648 len. 8]: `` You long - legged devil ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3649 len. 41]: he yelled , and I instantly received a series of concussions upon the face and head which put me in supreme doubt of my surroundings , for I seemed to have plunged , eyes foremost , into the Milky Way .
Parsing [sent. 3650 len. 30]: But I had my left arm around his neck , which probably saved me from a coup de grace , as he was forced to pommel me at half-length .
Parsing [sent. 3651 len. 29]: Pommel it was ; to use so gentle a word for what to me was crash , bang , smash , battle , murder , earthquake and tornado .
Parsing [sent. 3652 len. 37]: I was conscious of some one screaming , and it seemed a consoling part of my delirium that the cheek of Miss Anne Elliott should be jammed tight against mine through one phase of the explosion .
Parsing [sent. 3653 len. 49]: My arms were wrenched , my fingers twisted and tortured , and , when it was all too clear to me that I could not possibly bear one added iota of physical pain , the ingenious fiend began to kick my shins and knees with feet like crowbars .
Parsing [sent. 3654 len. 9]: Conflict of any sort was never my vocation .
Parsing [sent. 3655 len. 53]: I had not been an accessory - during-the-fact to a fight since I passed the truculent age of fourteen ; and it is a marvel that I was able to hang to that dynamic bundle of trained muscles -- which defines Mr. Earl Percy well enough -- for more than ten seconds .
Parsing [sent. 3656 len. 38]: Yet I did hang to him , as Pere Baudry testifies , for a minute and a half , which seems no inconsiderable lapse of time to a person undergoing such experiences as were then afflicting me .
Parsing [sent. 3657 len. 52]: It appeared to me that we were revolving in enormous circles in the ether , and I had long since given my last gasp , when there came a great roaring wind in my ears and a range of mountains toppled upon us both ; we went to earth beneath it .
Parsing [sent. 3658 len. 3]: `` Ha !
Parsing [sent. 3659 len. 8]: you must create violence , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3660 len. 4]: roared the avalanche .
Parsing [sent. 3661 len. 9]: And the voice was the voice of Keredec .
Parsing [sent. 3662 len. 48]: Some one pulled me from underneath my struggling antagonist , and , the power of sight in a hazy , zigzagging fashion coming back to me , I perceived the figure of Miss Anne Elliott recumbent beside me , her arms about Mr. Percy 's prostrate body .
Parsing [sent. 3663 len. 50]: The extraordinary girl had fastened upon him , too , though I had not known it , and she had gone to ground with us ; but it is to be said for Mr. Earl Percy that no blow of his touched her , and she was not hurt .
Parsing [sent. 3664 len. 16]: Even in the final extremities of temper , he had carefully discriminated in my favour .
Parsing [sent. 3665 len. 22]: Mrs. Harman was bending over her , and , as the girl sprang up lightly , threw her arms about her .
Parsing [sent. 3666 len. 52]: For my part , I rose more slowly , section by section , wondering why I did not fall apart ; lips , nose , and cheeks bleeding , and I had a fear that I should need to be led like a blind man , through my eyelids swelling shut .
Parsing [sent. 3667 len. 25]: That was something I earnestly desired should not happen ; but whether it did , or did not -- or if the heavens fell !
Parsing [sent. 3668 len. 52]: -- I meant to walk back to Quesnay with Anne Elliott that night , and , mangled , broken , or half-dead , presenting whatever appearance of the prize-ring or the abattoir that I might , I intended to take the same train for Paris on the morrow that she did .
Parsing [sent. 3669 len. 22]: For our days together were not at an end ; nor was it hers nor my desire that they should be .
Parsing [sent. 3670 len. 55]: CHAPTER XXII It was Oliver Saffren -- as I like to think of him -- who helped me to my feet and wiped my face with his handkerchief , and when that one was ruined , brought others from his bag and stanched the wounds gladly received , in the service of his wife .
Parsing [sent. 3671 len. 14]: `` I will remember -- '' he said , and his voice broke .
Parsing [sent. 3672 len. 13]: `` These are the memories which Keredec says make a man good .
Parsing [sent. 3673 len. 10]: I pray they will help to redeem me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3674 len. 34]: And for the last time I heard the child in him speaking : `` I ought to be redeemed ; I must be , do n't you think , for her sake ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3675 len. 6]: `` Lose no time ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3676 len. 3]: shouted Keredec .
Parsing [sent. 3677 len. 21]: `` You must be gone if you will reach that certain town for the five-o'clock train of the morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 3678 len. 17]: This was for the spy 's benefit ; it indicated Lisieux and the train to Paris .
Parsing [sent. 3679 len. 25]: Mr. Percy struggled ; the professor knelt over him , pinioning his wrists in one great hand , and holding him easily to earth .
Parsing [sent. 3680 len. 3]: `` Ha !
Parsing [sent. 3681 len. 43]: my friend -- '' he addressed his captive -- `` you shall not have cause to say we do you any harm ; there shall be no law , for you are not hurt , and you are not going to be .
Parsing [sent. 3682 len. 19]: But here you shall stay quiet for a little while -- till I say you can go . ''
Parsing [sent. 3683 len. 32]: As he spoke he bound the other 's wrists with a short rope which he took from his pocket , performing the same office immediately afterward for Mr. Percy 's ankles .
Parsing [sent. 3684 len. 7]: `` I take the count ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3685 len. 8]: was the sole remark of that philosopher .
Parsing [sent. 3686 len. 13]: `` I ca n't go up against no herd of elephants . ''
Parsing [sent. 3687 len. 14]: `` And now , '' said the professor , rising , `` good-bye !
Parsing [sent. 3688 len. 9]: The sun shall rise gloriously for you tomorrow .
Parsing [sent. 3689 len. 7]: Come , it is time . ''
Parsing [sent. 3690 len. 11]: The two women were crying in each other 's arms .
Parsing [sent. 3691 len. 4]: `` Good-bye ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3692 len. 4]: sobbed Anne Elliott .
Parsing [sent. 3693 len. 6]: Mrs. Harman turned to Keredec .
Parsing [sent. 3694 len. 3]: `` Good-bye !
Parsing [sent. 3695 len. 6]: for a little while . ''
Parsing [sent. 3696 len. 5]: He kissed her hand .
Parsing [sent. 3697 len. 12]: `` Dear lady , I shall come within the year . ''
Parsing [sent. 3698 len. 35]: She came to me , and I took her hand , meaning to kiss it as Keredec had done , but suddenly she was closer and I felt her lips upon my battered cheek .
Parsing [sent. 3699 len. 5]: I remember it now .
Parsing [sent. 3700 len. 31]: I wrung her husband 's hand , and then he took her in his arms , lifted her to the foot-board of the cart , and sprang up beside her .
Parsing [sent. 3701 len. 9]: `` God bless you , and good-bye ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3702 len. 3]: we called .
Parsing [sent. 3703 len. 8]: And their voices came back to us .
Parsing [sent. 3704 len. 8]: `` God bless YOU and good-bye ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3705 len. 8]: They were carried into the enveloping night .
Parsing [sent. 3706 len. 55]: We stared after them down the road ; watching the lantern on the tail-board of the cart diminish ; watching it dim and dwindle to a point of gray ; -- listening until the hoof-beats of the heavy Norman grew fainter than the rustle of the branch that rose above the wall beside us .
Parsing [sent. 3707 len. 48]: But it is bad luck to strain eyes and ears to the very last when friends are parting , because that so sharpens the loneliness ; and before the cart went quite beyond our ken , two of us set out upon the longest way to Quesnay .
