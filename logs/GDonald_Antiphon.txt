Parsing [sent. 1 len. 38]: ENGLAND 'S ANTIPHON BY GEORGE MACDONALD ENGLAND 'S ANTIPHON was originally published in 1868 PREFACE In this book I have sought to trace the course of our religious poetry from an early period of our literary history .
Parsing [sent. 2 len. 21]: This could hardly be done without reference to some of the principal phases of the religious history of the nation .
Parsing [sent. 3 len. 70]: To give anything like a full history of the religious feeling of a single county , would require a large book , and -- not to mention sermons -- would involve a thorough acquaintance with the hymns of the country , -- a very wide subject , which I have not considered of sufficient importance from a literary point of view to come within the scope of the volume .
Parsing [sent. 4 len. 45]: But if its poetry be the cream of a people 's thought , some true indications of the history of its religious feeling must be found in its religious verse , and I hope I have not altogether failed in setting forth these indications .
Parsing [sent. 5 len. 32]: My chief aim , however , will show itself to have been the mediating towards an intelligent and cordial sympathy betwixt my readers and the writers from whom I have quoted .
Parsing [sent. 6 len. 9]: In this I have some confidence of success .
Parsing [sent. 7 len. 19]: Heartily do I throw this my small pebble at the head of the great Sabbath-breaker _ Schism _ .

Parsing [sent. 54 len. 2]: INTRODUCTION .
Parsing [sent. 55 len. 27]: If the act of worship be the highest human condition , it follows that the highest human art must find material in the modes of worship .
Parsing [sent. 56 len. 57]: The first poetry of a nation will not be religious poetry : the nation must have a history at least before it can possess any material capable of being cast into the mould of religious utterance ; but , the nation once possessed of this material , poetry is the first form religious utterance will assume .
Parsing [sent. 57 len. 96]: The earliest form of literature is the ballad , which is the germ of all subsequent forms of poetry , for it has in itself all their elements : the _ lyric _ , for it was first chanted to some stringed instrument ; the _ epic _ , for it tells a tale , often of solemn and ancient report ; the _ dramatic _ , for its actors are ever ready to start forward into life , snatch the word from the mouth of the narrator , and speak in their own persons .
Parsing [sent. 58 len. 15]: All these forms have been used for the utterance of religious thought and feeling .
Parsing [sent. 59 len. 26]: Of the lyrical poems of England , religion possesses the most ; of the epic , the best ; of the dramatic , the oldest .
Parsing [sent. 60 len. 49]: Of each of these I shall have occasion to speak ; but , as the title of the book implies , -- for _ Antiphon _ means the responsive song of the parted choir , -- I shall have chiefly to do with the lyric or song form .
Parsing [sent. 61 len. 8]: For song is the speech of feeling .
Parsing [sent. 62 len. 11]: Even the prose of emotion always wanders into the rhythmical .
Parsing [sent. 63 len. 44]: Hence , as well as for other reasons belonging to its nature , it is one chief mode in which men unite to praise God ; for in thus praising they hold communion with each other , and the praise expands and grows .
Parsing [sent. 64 len. 39]: The _ individual _ heart , however , must first have been uplifted into praiseful song , before the common ground and form of feeling , in virtue of which men might thus meet , could be supplied .
Parsing [sent. 65 len. 17]: But the vocal utterance or the bodily presence is not at all necessary for this communion .
Parsing [sent. 66 len. 49]: When we read rejoicingly the true song-speech of one of our singing brethren , we hold song-worship with him and with all who have thus at any time shared in his feelings , even if he have passed centuries ago into the `` high countries '' of song .
Parsing [sent. 67 len. 48]: My object is to erect , as it were , in this book , a little auricle , or spot of concentrated hearing , where the hearts of my readers may listen , and join in the song of their country 's singing men and singing women .
Parsing [sent. 68 len. 49]: I will build it , if I may , like a chapel in the great church of England 's worship , gathering the sounds of its never-ceasing choir , heart after heart lifting up itself in the music of speech , heart after heart responding across the ages .
Parsing [sent. 69 len. 7]: Hearing , we worship with them .
Parsing [sent. 70 len. 44]: For we must not forget that , although the individual song springs from the heart of the individual , the song of a country is not merely cumulative : it is vital in its growth , and therefore composed of historically dependent members .
Parsing [sent. 71 len. 16]: No man could sing as he has sung , had not others sung before him .
Parsing [sent. 72 len. 13]: Deep answereth unto deep , face to face , praise to praise .
Parsing [sent. 73 len. 20]: To the sound of the trumpet the harp returns its own vibrating response -- alike , but how different !
Parsing [sent. 74 len. 22]: The religious song of the country , I say again , is a growth , rooted deep in all its story .
Parsing [sent. 75 len. 38]: Besides the fact that the lyric chiefly will rouse the devotional feeling , there is another reason why I should principally use it : I wish to make my book valuable in its parts as in itself .
Parsing [sent. 76 len. 16]: The value of a thing depends in large measure upon its unity , its wholeness .
Parsing [sent. 77 len. 34]: In a work of these limits , that form of verse alone can be available for its unity which is like the song of the bird -- a warble and then a stillness .
Parsing [sent. 78 len. 59]: However valuable an extract may be -- and I shall not quite eschew such -- an entire lyric , I had almost said _ however inferior _ , if worthy of a place at all , is of greater value , especially if regarded in relation to the form of setting with which I hope to surround it .
Parsing [sent. 79 len. 55]: There is a sense in which I may , without presumption , adopt the name of Choragus , or leader of the chorus , in relation to these singers : I must take upon me to order who shall sing , when he shall sing , and which of his songs he shall sing .
Parsing [sent. 80 len. 100]: But I would rather assume the office of master of the hearing , for my aim shall be to cause the song to be truly heard ; to set forth worthy points in form , in matter , and in relation ; to say with regard to the singer himself , his time , its modes , its beliefs , such things as may help to set the song in its true light -- its relation , namely , to the source whence it sprung , which alone can secure its right reception by the heart of the hearer .
Parsing [sent. 81 len. 42]: For my chief aim will be the heart ; seeing that , although there is no dividing of the one from the other , the heart can do far more for the intellect than the intellect can do for the heart .
Parsing [sent. 82 len. 21]: We must not now attempt to hear the singers of times so old that their language is unintelligible without labour .
Parsing [sent. 83 len. 20]: For this there is not room , even if otherwise it were desirable that such should divide the volume .
Parsing [sent. 84 len. 7]: We must leave Anglo-Saxon behind us .
Parsing [sent. 85 len. 66]: In Early English , I shall give a few valuable lyrics , but they shall not be so far removed from our present speech but that , with a reasonable amount of assistance , the nature and degree of which I shall set forth , they shall not only present themselves to the reader 's understanding , but commend themselves to his imagination and judgment .
Parsing [sent. 86 len. 9]: CHAPTER I. SACRED LYRICS OF THE THIRTEENTH CENTURY .
Parsing [sent. 87 len. 77]: In the midst of wars and rumours of wars , the strife of king and barons , and persistent efforts to subdue neighbouring countries , the mere effervescence of the life of the nation , let us think for a moment of that to which the poems I am about to present bear good witness -- the true life of the people , growing quietly , slowly , unperceived -- the leaven hid in the meal .
Parsing [sent. 88 len. 10]: For what is the true life of a nation ?
Parsing [sent. 89 len. 40]: That , I answer , in its modes of thought , its manners and habits , which favours the growth within the individual of that kingdom of heaven for the sake only of which the kingdoms of earth exist .
Parsing [sent. 90 len. 63]: The true life of the people , as distinguished from the nation , is simply the growth in its individuals of those eternal principles of truth , in proportion to whose power in them they take rank in the kingdom of heaven , the only kingdom that can endure , all others being but as the mimicries of children playing at government .
Parsing [sent. 91 len. 49]: Little as they then knew of the relations of the wonderful story on which their faith was built , to everything human , the same truth was at work then which is now -- poor as the recognition of these relations yet is -- slowly setting men free .
Parsing [sent. 92 len. 14]: In the hardest winter the roots are still alive in the frozen ground .
Parsing [sent. 93 len. 20]: In the silence of the monastery , unnatural as that life was , germinated much of this deeper life .
Parsing [sent. 94 len. 36]: As we must not judge of the life of the nation by its kings and mighty men , so we must not judge of the life in the Church by those who are called Rabbi .
Parsing [sent. 95 len. 40]: The very notion of the kingdom of heaven implies a secret growth , secret from no affectation of mystery , but because its goings-on are in the depths of the human nature where it holds communion with the Divine .
Parsing [sent. 96 len. 38]: In the Church , as in society , we often find that that which shows itself uppermost is but the froth , a sign , it may be , of life beneath , but in itself worthless .
Parsing [sent. 97 len. 25]: When the man arises with a servant 's heart and a ruler 's brain , then is the summer of the Church 's content .
Parsing [sent. 98 len. 46]: But whether the men who wrote the following songs moved in some shining orbit of rank , or only knelt in some dim chapel , and walked in some pale cloister , we can not tell , for they have left no name behind them .
Parsing [sent. 99 len. 18]: My reader will observe that there is little of theory and much of love in these lyrics .
Parsing [sent. 100 len. 15]: The recognition of a living Master is far more than any notions about him .
Parsing [sent. 101 len. 45]: In the worship of him a thousand truths are working , unknown and yet active , which , embodied in theory , and dissociated from the living mind that was in Christ , will as certainly breed worms as any omer of hoarded manna .
Parsing [sent. 102 len. 27]: Holding the skirt of his garment in one hand , we shall in the other hold the key to all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge .
Parsing [sent. 103 len. 15]: I think almost all the earliest religious poetry is about him and his mother .
Parsing [sent. 104 len. 11]: Their longing after his humanity made them idolize his mother .
Parsing [sent. 105 len. 27]: If we forget that only through his humanity can we approach his divinity , we shall soon forget likewise that his mother is blessed among women .
Parsing [sent. 106 len. 24]: I take the poems from one of the Percy Society publications , edited by Mr. Wright from a manuscript in the British Museum .
Parsing [sent. 107 len. 33]: He adjudges them to the reign of Edward I. Perhaps we may find in them a sign or two that in cultivating our intellect we have in some measure neglected our heart .
Parsing [sent. 108 len. 24]: But first as to the mode in which I present them to my readers : I have followed these rules : -- 1 .
Parsing [sent. 109 len. 72]: Wherever a word differs from the modern word only in spelling , I have , for the sake of readier comprehension , substituted the modern form , with the following exception : -- Where the spelling indicates a different pronunciation , necessary for the rhyme or the measure , I retain such part of the older form , marking with an acute accent any vowel now silent which must be sounded .
Parsing [sent. 110 len. 2]: 2 .
Parsing [sent. 111 len. 18]: Where the word used is antique in root , I give the modern synonym in the margin .
Parsing [sent. 112 len. 7]: Antique phrases I explain in foot-notes .
Parsing [sent. 113 len. 26]: It must be borne in mind that our modern pronunciation can hardly fail in other cases as well to injure the melody of the verses .
Parsing [sent. 114 len. 18]: The modern reader will often find it difficult to get a rhythm out of some of them .
Parsing [sent. 115 len. 9]: This may arise from any of several causes .
Parsing [sent. 116 len. 31]: In the first place many final _ e _ 's were then sounded which are now silent ; and it is not easy to tell which of them to sound .
Parsing [sent. 117 len. 24]: Again , some words were pronounced as dissyllables which we treat as monosyllables , and others as monosyllables which we treat as dissyllables .
Parsing [sent. 118 len. 36]: I suspect besides , that some of the old writers were content to allow a prolonged syllable to stand for two short ones , a mode not without great beauty when sparingly and judiciously employed .
Parsing [sent. 119 len. 13]: Short supernumerary syllables were likewise allowed considerable freedom to come and go .
Parsing [sent. 120 len. 32]: A good deal must , however , be put down to the carelessness and presumption of the transcribers , who may very well have been incapable of detecting their own blunders .
Parsing [sent. 121 len. 30]: One of these ancient mechanics of literature caused Chaucer endless annoyance with his corruptions , as a humorous little poem , the last in his works , sufficiently indicates .
Parsing [sent. 122 len. 19]: From the same sources no doubt spring as well most of the variations of text in the manuscripts .
Parsing [sent. 123 len. 23]: The first of the poems is chiefly a conversation between the Lord on the cross and his mother standing at its foot .
Parsing [sent. 124 len. 19]: A few prefatory remarks in explanation of some of its allusions will help my readers to enjoy it .
Parsing [sent. 125 len. 41]: It was at one time a common belief , and the notion has not yet , I think , altogether vanished , that the dying are held back from repose by the love that is unwilling to yield them up .
Parsing [sent. 126 len. 17]: Hence , in the third stanza , the Lord prays his mother to let him die .
Parsing [sent. 127 len. 25]: In the fifth , he reasons against her overwhelming sorrows on the ground of the deliverance his sufferings will bring to the human race .
Parsing [sent. 128 len. 9]: But she can only feel her own misery .
Parsing [sent. 129 len. 39]: To understand the seventh and eighth , it is necessary to know that , among other strange things accepted by the early Church , it was believed that the mother of Jesus had no suffering at his birth .
Parsing [sent. 130 len. 13]: This of course rendered her incapable of perfect sympathy with other mothers .
Parsing [sent. 131 len. 34]: It is a lovely invention , then , that he should thus commend mothers to his mother , telling her to judge of the pains of motherhood by those which she now endured .
Parsing [sent. 132 len. 9]: Still he fails to turn aside her thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 133 len. 38]: She is thinking still only of her own and her son 's suffering , while he continues bent on making her think of others , until , at last , forth comes her prayer for all women .
Parsing [sent. 134 len. 10]: This seems to me a tenderness grand as exquisite .
Parsing [sent. 135 len. 39]: The outburst of the chorus of the Faithful in the last stanza but one , -- When he rose , then fell her sorrow , is as fine as anything I know in the region of the lyric .
Parsing [sent. 136 len. 16]: `` Stand well , mother , under rood ; -LSB- 1 -RSB- _ the cross .
Parsing [sent. 137 len. 11]: _ Behold thy son with gladé mood ; _ cheerful .
Parsing [sent. 138 len. 8]: _ Blithe mother mayst thou be . ''
Parsing [sent. 139 len. 9]: `` Son , how should I blithé stand ?
Parsing [sent. 140 len. 16]: I see thy feet , I see thy hand Nailéd to the hard tree . ''
Parsing [sent. 141 len. 14]: `` Mother , do way thy wepynde : _ give over thy weeping .
Parsing [sent. 142 len. 10]: _ I tholé death for mankind -- _ suffer .
Parsing [sent. 143 len. 9]: _ For my guilt thole I none . ''
Parsing [sent. 144 len. 12]: `` Son , I feel the dede stounde ; _ death-pang .

Parsing [sent. 146 len. 7]: _ That me byhet Simeon . ''

Parsing [sent. 148 len. 6]: _ `` Mother , mercy !
Parsing [sent. 149 len. 17]: let me die , For Adam out of hell buy , _ for to buy Adam .
Parsing [sent. 150 len. 9]: _ And his kin that is forlore . ''
Parsing [sent. 151 len. 3]: _ lost .
Parsing [sent. 152 len. 10]: _ `` Son , what shall me to rede ?
Parsing [sent. 153 len. 13]: -LSB- 2 -RSB- My pain paineth me to dede : _ death .
Parsing [sent. 154 len. 8]: _ Let me die thee before ! ''
Parsing [sent. 155 len. 34]: `` Mother , thou rue all of thy bairn ; _ rue thou _ ; _ all _ is only expletive Thou wash away the bloody tern ; _ wash thou ; tears .
Parsing [sent. 156 len. 10]: _ It doth me worse than my ded . ''
Parsing [sent. 157 len. 7]: _ hurts me more ; death .
Parsing [sent. 158 len. 10]: _ `` Son , how may I terés werne ?
Parsing [sent. 159 len. 5]: _ turn aside tears .

Parsing [sent. 169 len. 6]: _ woe be to me .
Parsing [sent. 170 len. 28]: _ `` Mother , now I shall thee tell , If I not die , thou goest to hell : I thole death for thy sake . ''
Parsing [sent. 171 len. 3]: _ endure .
Parsing [sent. 172 len. 14]: _ `` Son , thou art so meek and mynde , _ thoughtful .
Parsing [sent. 173 len. 22]: _ Ne wyt me not , it is my kind -LSB- 3 -RSB- That I for thee this sorrow make . ''

Parsing [sent. 242 len. 23]: _ All this world it goeth away , Me thinketh it nigheth Doomsday ; Now man goes to ground : _ perishes .
Parsing [sent. 243 len. 10]: _ Jesus Christ that tholed ded _ endured death .
Parsing [sent. 244 len. 11]: _ He may our souls to heaven led _ lead .
Parsing [sent. 245 len. 6]: _ Within a little stound .
Parsing [sent. 246 len. 3]: _ moment .
Parsing [sent. 247 len. 21]: _ Jesus , that was mild and free , Was with spear y-stongen ; _ stung _ or _ pierced .
Parsing [sent. 248 len. 12]: _ He was nailéd to the tree , With scourges y-swongen .
Parsing [sent. 249 len. 3]: _ lashed .
Parsing [sent. 250 len. 11]: _ All for man he tholed shame , _ endured .
Parsing [sent. 251 len. 15]: _ Withouten guilt , withouten blame , Bothé day and other -LSB- 8 -RSB- .
Parsing [sent. 252 len. 11]: Man , full muchel he loved thee , _ much .
Parsing [sent. 253 len. 13]: _ When he woldé make thee free , And become thy brother .
Parsing [sent. 254 len. 16]: The simplicity , the tenderness , the devotion of these lyrics is to me wonderful .
Parsing [sent. 255 len. 80]: Observe their realism , as , for instance , in the words : `` The stones beoth al wete ; '' a realism as far removed from the coarseness of a Rubens as from the irreverence of too many religious teachers , who will repeat and repeat again the most sacred words for the merest logical ends until the tympanum of the moral ear hears without hearing the sounds that ought to be felt as well as held holiest .
Parsing [sent. 256 len. 62]: They bear strongly , too , upon the outcome of feeling in action , although doubtless there was the same tendency then as there is now to regard the observance of church-ordinances as the service of Christ , instead of as a means of gathering strength wherewith to serve him by being in the world as he was in the world .
Parsing [sent. 257 len. 72]: From a poem of forty-eight stanzas I choose five , partly in order to manifest that , although there is in it an occasional appearance of what we should consider sentimentality , allied in nature to that worship of the Virgin which is more a sort of French gallantry than a feeling of reverence , the sense of duty to the Master keeps pace with the profession of devotedness to him .
Parsing [sent. 258 len. 19]: There is so little continuity of thought in it , that the stanzas might almost be arranged anyhow .
Parsing [sent. 259 len. 20]: Jesu , thy love be all my thought ; Of other thing ne reck I nought ; _ reckon .
Parsing [sent. 260 len. 17]: _ I yearn to have thy will y-wrought , For thou me hast well dear y-bought .
Parsing [sent. 261 len. 25]: Jesu , well may mine hearté see That mild and meek he must be , All unthews and lustés flee , _ bad habits .
Parsing [sent. 262 len. 9]: _ That feelen will the bliss of thee .
Parsing [sent. 263 len. 3]: _ feel .
Parsing [sent. 264 len. 23]: _ For sinful folk , sweet Jesus , Thou lightest from the high house ; Poor and low thou wert for us .
Parsing [sent. 265 len. 8]: Thine heart 's love thou sendest us .
Parsing [sent. 266 len. 27]: Jesu , therefore beseech I thee Thy sweet love thou grant me ; That I thereto worthy be , Make me worthy that art so free .
Parsing [sent. 267 len. 5]: _ thou that art .
Parsing [sent. 268 len. 9]: _ Jesu , thine help at my ending !
Parsing [sent. 269 len. 13]: And in that dreadful out-wending , _ going forth of the spirit .
Parsing [sent. 270 len. 10]: _ Send my soul good weryyng , _ guard .
Parsing [sent. 271 len. 9]: _ That I ne dread none evil thing .
Parsing [sent. 272 len. 50]: I shall next present a short lyric , displaying more of art than this last , giving it now in the old form , and afterwards in a new one , that my reader may see both how it looks in its original dress , and what it means .
Parsing [sent. 273 len. 24]: Wynter wakeneth al my care , Nou this leves waxeth bare , Ofte y sike ant mourne sare , _ sigh ; sore .
Parsing [sent. 274 len. 19]: _ When hit cometh in my thoht Of this worldes joie , how hit goth al to noht .

Parsing [sent. 280 len. 20]: _ Ant shild us from helle ; For y not whider y shal , ne hou longe her duelle .
Parsing [sent. 281 len. 33]: -LSB- 12 -RSB- I will now give a modern version of it , in which I have spoiled the original of course , but I hope as little as well may be .
Parsing [sent. 282 len. 41]: Winter wakeneth all my care ; Now the trees are waxing bare ; Oft my sighs my grief declare -LSB- 13 -RSB- When it comes into my thought Of this world 's joy , how it goes all to nought .
Parsing [sent. 283 len. 19]: Now it is , and now 't is not -- As it ne'er had been , I wot .
Parsing [sent. 284 len. 27]: Hence many say -- it is man 's lot : All goeth but God 's will ; We all die , though we like it ill .
Parsing [sent. 285 len. 88]: Green about me grows the grain ; Now it yelloweth all again : Jesus , give us help amain , And shield us from hell ; For when or whither I go I can not tell There were no doubt many religious poems in a certain amount of circulation of a different cast from these ; some a metrical recounting of portions of the Bible history -- a kind unsuited to our ends ; others a setting forth of the doctrines and duties then believed and taught .
Parsing [sent. 286 len. 33]: Of the former class is one of the oldest Anglo-Saxon poems we have , that of Caedmon , and there are many specimens to be found in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries .
Parsing [sent. 287 len. 35]: They could , however , have been of little service to the people , so few of whom could read , or could have procured manuscripts if they had been able to use them .
Parsing [sent. 288 len. 18]: A long and elaborate composition of the latter class was written in the reign of Edward II .
Parsing [sent. 289 len. 11]: by William de Shoreham , vicar of Chart-Sutton in Kent .
Parsing [sent. 290 len. 13]: He probably taught his own verses to the people at his catechisings .
Parsing [sent. 291 len. 24]: The intention was , no doubt , by the aid of measure and rhyme to facilitate the remembrance of the facts and doctrines .
Parsing [sent. 292 len. 86]: It consists of a long poem on the Seven Sacraments ; of a shorter , associating the Canonical Hours with the principal events of the close of our Lord 's life ; of an exposition of the Ten Commandments , followed by a kind of treatise on the Seven Cardinal Sins : the fifth part describes the different joys of the Virgin ; the sixth , in praise of the Virgin , is perhaps the most poetic ; the last is less easy to characterize .
Parsing [sent. 293 len. 13]: The poem is written in the Kentish dialect , and is difficult .
Parsing [sent. 294 len. 46]: I shall now turn into modern verse a part of `` The Canonical Hours , '' giving its represented foundation of the various acts of worship in the Romish Church throughout the day , from early in the morning to the last service at night .
Parsing [sent. 295 len. 23]: After every fact concerning our Lord , follows an apostrophe to his mother , which I omit , being compelled to choose .
Parsing [sent. 296 len. 22]: Father 's wisdom lifted high , Lord of us aright -- God and man taken was , At matin-time by night .
Parsing [sent. 297 len. 22]: The disciples that were his , Anon they him forsook ; Sold to Jews and betrayed , To torture him took .
Parsing [sent. 298 len. 24]: At the prime Jesus was led In presence of Pilate , Where witnesses , false and fell , Laughed at him for hate .
Parsing [sent. 299 len. 25]: In the neck they him smote , Bound his hands of might ; Spit upon that sweet face That heaven and earth did light .
Parsing [sent. 300 len. 4]: `` Crucify him !
Parsing [sent. 301 len. 3]: crucify ! ''
Parsing [sent. 302 len. 21]: They cried at nine o'clock ; A purple cloth they put on him -- To stare at him and mock .
Parsing [sent. 303 len. 17]: They upon his sweet head Stuck a thorny crown ; To Calvary his cross he bears .
Parsing [sent. 304 len. 26]: Pitiful , from the town Jesus was nailed on the cross At the noon-tide ; Strong thieves they hanged up , One on either side .
Parsing [sent. 305 len. 24]: In his pain , his strong thirst Quenched they with gall ; So that God 's holy Lamb From sin washed us all .
Parsing [sent. 306 len. 18]: At the nones Jesus Christ Felt the hard death ; He to his father `` Eloi ! ''
Parsing [sent. 307 len. 8]: cried , Gan up yield his breath .
Parsing [sent. 308 len. 26]: A soldier with a sharp spear Pierced his right side ; The earth shook , the sun grew dim , The moment that he died .
Parsing [sent. 309 len. 22]: He was taken off the cross At even-song 's hour ; The strength left and hid in God Of our Saviour .
Parsing [sent. 310 len. 10]: Such death he underwent , Of life the medicine !
Parsing [sent. 311 len. 2]: Alas !
Parsing [sent. 312 len. 12]: he was laid adown -- The crown of bliss in pine !
Parsing [sent. 313 len. 24]: At complines , it was borne away To the burying , That noble corpse of Jesus Christ , Hope of life 's coming .
Parsing [sent. 314 len. 22]: Anointed richly it was , Fulfilled his holy book : I pray , Lord , thy passion In my mind lock .
Parsing [sent. 315 len. 25]: Childlike simplicity , realism , and tenderness will be evident in this , as in preceding poems , especially in the choice of adjectives .
Parsing [sent. 316 len. 30]: But indeed the combination of certain words had become conventional ; as `` The hard tree , '' `` The nails great and strong , '' and such like .
Parsing [sent. 317 len. 45]: I know I have spoiled the poem in half-translating it thus ; but I have rendered it intelligible to all my readers , have not wandered from the original , and have retained a degree of antiqueness both in the tone and the expression .
Parsing [sent. 318 len. 3]: CHAPTER II .
Parsing [sent. 319 len. 11]: THE MIRACLE PLAYS AND OTHER POEMS OF THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY .
Parsing [sent. 320 len. 22]: The oldest form of regular dramatic representation in England was the Miracle Plays , improperly called Mysteries , after the French .
Parsing [sent. 321 len. 47]: To these plays the people of England , in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries , owed a very large portion of what religious knowledge they possessed , for the prayers were in an unknown tongue , the sermons were very few , and printing was uninvented .
Parsing [sent. 322 len. 49]: The plays themselves , introduced into the country by the Normans , were , in the foolish endeavour to make Normans of Anglo-Saxons , represented in Norman French -LSB- 14 -RSB- until the year 1338 , when permission was obtained from the Pope to represent them in English .
Parsing [sent. 323 len. 16]: The word _ Miracle _ , in their case , means anything recorded in Scripture .
Parsing [sent. 324 len. 43]: The Miracle Plays had for their subjects the chief incidents of Old and New Testament history ; not merely , however , of this history as accepted by the Reformed Church , but of that contained in the Apocryphal Gospels as well .
Parsing [sent. 325 len. 22]: An entire series of these _ Miracles _ consisted of short dramatic representations of many single passages of the sacred story .
Parsing [sent. 326 len. 8]: The whole would occupy about three days .
Parsing [sent. 327 len. 12]: It began with the Creation , and ended with the Judgment .
Parsing [sent. 328 len. 19]: That for which the city of Coventry was famous consists of forty-two subjects , with a long prologue .
Parsing [sent. 329 len. 34]: Composed by ecclesiastics , the plays would seem to have been first represented by them only , although afterwards it was not always considered right for the clergy to be concerned with them .
Parsing [sent. 330 len. 40]: The hypocritical Franciscan friar , in `` Piers Ploughman 's Creed , '' a poem of the close of the same century , claims as a virtue for his order -- At markets and miracles we meddleth us never .
Parsing [sent. 331 len. 18]: They would seem likewise to have been first represented in churches and chapels , sometimes in churchyards .
Parsing [sent. 332 len. 20]: Later , when the actors chiefly belonged to city-guilds , they were generally represented in the streets and squares .
Parsing [sent. 333 len. 48]: It must be borne in mind by any who would understand the influence of these plays upon the people , that much in them appearing to us grotesque , childish , absurd , and even irreverent , had no such appearance in the eyes of the spectators .
Parsing [sent. 334 len. 78]: A certain amount of the impression of absurdity is simply the consequence of antiquity ; and even that which is rightly regarded as absurd in the present age , will not at least have produced the discomposing effects of absurdity upon the less developed beholders of that age ; just as the quaint pictures with which their churches were decorated may make us smile , but were by them regarded with awe and reverence from their infancy .
Parsing [sent. 335 len. 100]: It must be confessed that there is in them even occasional coarseness ; but that the devil for instance should always be represented as a baffled fool , and made to play the buffoon sometimes after a disgusting fashion , was to them only the treatment he deserved : it was their notion of `` poetic justice ; '' while most of them were too childish to be shocked at the discord thus introduced , and many , we may well hope , too childlike to lose their reverence for the holy because of the proximity of the ridiculous .
Parsing [sent. 336 len. 35]: There seems to me considerably more of poetic worth scattered through these plays than is generally recognized ; and I am glad to be able to do a little to set forth the fact .
Parsing [sent. 337 len. 27]: I can not doubt that my readers will be interested in such fragments as the scope and design of my book will allow me to offer .
Parsing [sent. 338 len. 33]: Had there been no such passages , I might have regarded the plays as but remotely connected with my purpose , and mentioned them merely as a dramatic form of religious versification .
Parsing [sent. 339 len. 30]: I quote from the _ Coventry Miracles _ , better known than either of the other two sets in existence , the Chester Plays and those of Widkirk Abbey .
Parsing [sent. 340 len. 63]: The manuscript from which they have been edited by Mr. Halliwell , one of those students of our early literature to whom we are endlessly indebted for putting valuable things within our reach , is by no means so old as the plays themselves ; it bears date 1468 , a hundred and thirty years after they appeared in their English dress .
Parsing [sent. 341 len. 39]: Their language is considerably modernized , a process constantly going on where transcription is the means of transmission -- not to mention that the actors would of course make many changes to the speech of their own time .
Parsing [sent. 342 len. 19]: I shall modernize it a little further , but only as far as change of spelling will go .
Parsing [sent. 343 len. 11]: The first of the course is _ The Creation _ .
Parsing [sent. 344 len. 9]: God , and angels , and Lucifer appear .
Parsing [sent. 345 len. 68]: That God should here utter , I can not say announce , the doctrine of the Trinity , may be defended on the ground that he does so in a soliloquy ; but when we find afterwards that the same doctrine is one of the subjects upon which the boy Jesus converses with the doctors in the Temple , we can not help remarking the strange anachronism .
Parsing [sent. 346 len. 24]: Two remarkable lines in the said soliloquy are these : And all that ever shall have being It is closed in my mind .
Parsing [sent. 347 len. 21]: The next scene is the _ Fall of Man _ , which is full of poetic feeling and expression both .
Parsing [sent. 348 len. 9]: I must content myself with a few passages .
Parsing [sent. 349 len. 22]: Here is part of Eve 's lamentation , when she is conscious of the death that has laid hold upon her .
Parsing [sent. 350 len. 15]: Alas that ever that speech was spoken That the false angel said unto me !
Parsing [sent. 351 len. 2]: Alas !
Parsing [sent. 352 len. 16]: our Maker 's bidding is broken , For I have touched his own dear tree .
Parsing [sent. 353 len. 10]: Our fleshly eyes are all unlokyn , _ unlocked .
Parsing [sent. 354 len. 18]: _ Naked for sin ourself we see ; That sorry apple that we have sokyn _ sucked .
Parsing [sent. 355 len. 10]: _ To death hath brought my spouse and me .
Parsing [sent. 356 len. 24]: When the voice of God is heard , saying , Adam , that with my hands I made , Where art thou now ?
Parsing [sent. 357 len. 5]: what hast thou wrought ?
Parsing [sent. 358 len. 23]: Adam replies , in two lines , containing the whole truth of man 's spiritual condition ever since : Ah , Lord !
Parsing [sent. 359 len. 18]: for sin our flowers do fade : I hear thy voice , but I see thee nought .
Parsing [sent. 360 len. 39]: The vision had vanished , but the voice remained ; for they that hear shall live , and to the pure in heart one day the vision shall be restored , for `` they shall see God . ''
Parsing [sent. 361 len. 47]: There is something wonderfully touching in the quaint simplicity of the following words of God to the woman : Unwise woman , say me why That thou hast done this foul folly , And I made thee a great lady , In Paradise for to play ?
Parsing [sent. 362 len. 29]: As they leave the gates , the angel with the flaming sword ends his speech thus : This bliss I spere from you right fast ; _ bar .
Parsing [sent. 363 len. 35]: _ Herein come ye no more , Till a child of a maid be born , And upon the rood rent and torn , To save all that ye have forlorn , _ lost .
Parsing [sent. 364 len. 7]: _ Your wealth for to restore .
Parsing [sent. 365 len. 47]: Eve laments bitterly , and at length offers her throat to her husband , praying him to strangle her : Now stumble we on stalk and stone ; My wit away from me is gone ; Writhe on to my neck-bone With hardness of thine hand .
Parsing [sent. 366 len. 67]: Adam replies -- not over politely -- Wife , thy wit is not worth a rush ; and goes on to make what excuse for themselves he can in a very simple and touching manner : Our hap was hard , our wit was nesche , _ soft , weak , _ still in use in To Paradise when we were brought : -LSB- some provinces .
Parsing [sent. 367 len. 14]: My weeping shall be long fresh ; Short liking shall be long bought .
Parsing [sent. 368 len. 3]: _ pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 369 len. 19]: _ The scene ends with these words from Eve : Alas , that ever we wrought this sin !
Parsing [sent. 370 len. 22]: Our bodily sustenance for to win , Ye must delve and I shall spin , In care to lead our life .
Parsing [sent. 371 len. 174]: _ Cain and Abel _ follows ; then _ Noah 's Flood _ , in which God says , They shall not dread the flood 's flow ; then _ Abraham 's Sacrifice _ ; then _ Moses and the Two Tables _ ; then _ The Prophets _ , each of whom prophesies of the coming Saviour ; after which we find ourselves in the Apocryphal Gospels , in the midst of much nonsense about Anna and Joachim , the parents of Mary , about Joseph and Mary and the birth of Jesus , till we arrive at _ The Shepherds _ and _ The Magi , The Purification , The Slaughter of the Innocents , The Disputing in the Temple , The Baptism , The Temptation _ , and _ The Woman taken in Adultery _ , at which point I pause for the sake of the remarkable tradition embodied in the scene -- that each of the woman 's accusers thought Jesus was writing his individual sins on the ground .
Parsing [sent. 372 len. 46]: While he is writing the second time , the Pharisee , the Accuser , and the Scribe , who have chiefly sustained the dialogue hitherto , separate , each going into a different part of the Temple , and soliloquize thus : _ Pharisee _ .
Parsing [sent. 373 len. 2]: Alas !
Parsing [sent. 374 len. 2]: alas !
Parsing [sent. 375 len. 4]: I am ashamed !
Parsing [sent. 376 len. 22]: I am afeared that I shall die ; All my sins even properly named Yon prophet did write before mine eye .
Parsing [sent. 377 len. 33]: If that my fellows that did espy , They will tell it both far and wide ; My sinful living if they outcry , I wot not where my head to hide .
Parsing [sent. 378 len. 4]: _ Accuser _ .
Parsing [sent. 379 len. 2]: Alas !
Parsing [sent. 380 len. 32]: for sorrow mine heart doth bleed , All my sins yon man did write ; If that my fellows to them took heed , I can not me from death acquite .
Parsing [sent. 381 len. 29]: I would I were hid somewhere out of sight , That men should me nowhere see nor know ; If I be taken I am aflyght _ afraid .
Parsing [sent. 382 len. 9]: _ In mekyl shame I shall be throwe .
Parsing [sent. 383 len. 3]: _ much .
Parsing [sent. 384 len. 5]: _ _ Scribe _ .
Parsing [sent. 385 len. 7]: Alas the time that this betyd !
Parsing [sent. 386 len. 3]: _ happened .
Parsing [sent. 387 len. 8]: _ Right bitter care doth me embrace .
Parsing [sent. 388 len. 16]: All my sins be now unhid , Yon man before me them all doth trace .
Parsing [sent. 389 len. 36]: If I were once out of this place , To suffer death great and vengeance able , -LSB- 15 -RSB- I will never come before his face , Though I should die in a stable .
Parsing [sent. 390 len. 50]: Upon this follows _ The Raising of Lazarus _ ; next _ The Council of the Jews _ , to which the devil appears as a Prologue , dressed in the extreme of the fashion of the day , which he sets forth minutely enough in his speech also .
Parsing [sent. 391 len. 101]: _ The Entry into Jerusalem ; The Last Supper ; The Betrayal ; King Herod ; The Trial of Christ ; Pilate 's Wife 's Dream _ come next ; to the subject of the last of which the curious but generally accepted origin is given , that it was inspired by Satan , anxious that Jesus should not be slain , because he dreaded the mischief he would work when he entered Hades or Hell , for there is no distinction between them either here or in the Apocryphal Gospel whence the _ Descent into Hell _ is taken .
Parsing [sent. 392 len. 63]: Then follow _ The Crucifixion _ and _ The Descent into Hell _ -- often called the _ Harrowing of Hell _ -- that is , the _ making war upon _ or _ despoiling of hell _ , -LSB- 16 -RSB- for which the authority is a passage in the Gospel of Nicodemus , full of a certain florid Eastern grandeur .
Parsing [sent. 393 len. 30]: I need hardly remind my readers that the Apostles ' Creed , as it now stands , contains the same legend in the form of an article of faith .
Parsing [sent. 394 len. 13]: The allusions to it are frequent in the early literature of Christendom .
Parsing [sent. 395 len. 25]: The soul of Christ comes to the gates of hell , and says : Undo your gates of sorwatorie ; _ place of sorrow .
Parsing [sent. 396 len. 23]: _ On man 's soul I have memorie ; There cometh now the king of glory , These gates for to breke !
Parsing [sent. 397 len. 27]: Ye devils that are here within , Hell gates ye shall unpin ; I shall deliver man 's kin -- From woe I will them wreke .
Parsing [sent. 398 len. 3]: _ avenge .
Parsing [sent. 399 len. 29]: _ * * * * * Against me it were but waste To holdyn or to standyn fast ; Hell-lodge may not last Against the king of glory .
Parsing [sent. 400 len. 29]: Thy dark door down I throw ; My fair friends now well I know ; I shall them bring , reckoned by row , Out of their purgatory !
Parsing [sent. 401 len. 47]: _ The Burial ; The Resurrection ; The Three Maries ; Christ appearing to Mary ; The Pilgrim of Emmaus ; The Ascension ; The Descent of the Holy Ghost ; The Assumption of the Virgin _ ; and _ Doomsday _ , close the series .
Parsing [sent. 402 len. 33]: I have quoted enough to show that these plays must , in the condition of the people to whom they were presented , have had much to do with their religious education .
Parsing [sent. 403 len. 11]: This fourteenth century was a wonderful time of outbursting life .
Parsing [sent. 404 len. 48]: Although we can not claim the _ Miracles _ as entirely English products , being in all probability translations from the Norman-French , yet the fact that they were thus translated is one remarkable amongst many in this dawn of the victory of England over her conquerors .
Parsing [sent. 405 len. 10]: From this time , English prospered and French decayed .
Parsing [sent. 406 len. 72]: Their own language was now , so far , authorized as the medium of religious instruction to the people , while a similar change had passed upon processes at law ; and , most significant of all , the greatest poet of the time , and one of the three greatest poets as yet of all English time , wrote , although a courtier , in the language of the people .
Parsing [sent. 407 len. 23]: Before selecting some of Chaucer 's religious verses , however , I must speak of two or three poems by other writers .
Parsing [sent. 408 len. 31]: The first of these is _ The Vision of William concerning Piers Plowman _ , -- a poem of great influence in the same direction as the writings of Wycliffe .
Parsing [sent. 409 len. 26]: It is a vision and an allegory , wherein the vices of the time , especially those of the clergy , are unsparingly dealt with .
Parsing [sent. 410 len. 18]: Towards the close it loses itself in a metaphysical allegory concerning Dowel , Dobet , and Dobest .
Parsing [sent. 411 len. 12]: -LSB- 17 -RSB- I do not find much poetry in it .
Parsing [sent. 412 len. 45]: There is more , to my mind , in another poem , written some thirty or forty years later , the author of which is unknown , perhaps because he was an imitator of William Langland , the author of the _ Vision _ .
Parsing [sent. 413 len. 11]: It is called _ Pierce the Plough-man 's Crede _ .
Parsing [sent. 414 len. 28]: Both are written after the fashion of the Anglo-Saxon poetry , and not after the fashion of the Anglo-Norman , of which distinction a little more presently .
Parsing [sent. 415 len. 22]: Its object is to contrast the life and character of the four orders of friars with those of a simple Christian .
Parsing [sent. 416 len. 12]: There is considerable humour in the working plan of the poem .
Parsing [sent. 417 len. 37]: A certain poor man says he has succeeded in learning his A B C , his Paternoster , and his Ave Mary , but he can not , do what he will , learn his Creed .
Parsing [sent. 418 len. 32]: He sets out , therefore , to find some one whose life , according with his profession , may give him a hope that he will teach him his creed aright .
Parsing [sent. 419 len. 6]: He applies to the friars .
Parsing [sent. 420 len. 35]: One after another , every order abuses the other ; nor this only , but for money offers either to teach him his creed , or to absolve him for ignorance of the same .
Parsing [sent. 421 len. 23]: He finds no helper until he falls in with Pierce the Ploughman , of whose poverty he gives a most touching description .
Parsing [sent. 422 len. 47]: I shall , however , only quote some lines of _ The Believe _ as taught by the Ploughman , and this principally to show the nature of the versification : Leve thou on our Lord God , that all the world wroughté ; _ believe .
Parsing [sent. 423 len. 51]: _ Holy heaven upon high wholly he formed ; And is almighty himself over all his workés ; And wrought as his will was , the world and the heaven ; And on gentle Jesus Christ , engendered of himselven , His own only Son , Lord over all y-knowen .
Parsing [sent. 424 len. 32]: * * * * * With thorn y-crowned , crucified , and on the cross diéd ; And sythen his blessed body was in a stone buried ; _ after that .
Parsing [sent. 425 len. 21]: _ And descended adown to the dark hellé , And fetched out our forefathers ; and they full fain weren .
Parsing [sent. 426 len. 3]: _ glad .
Parsing [sent. 427 len. 25]: _ The third day readily , himself rose from death , And on a stone there he stood , he stey up to heaven .
Parsing [sent. 428 len. 5]: _ where : ascended .
Parsing [sent. 429 len. 7]: _ Here there is no rhyme .
Parsing [sent. 430 len. 36]: There is measure -- a dance-movement in the verse ; and likewise , in most of the lines , what was essential to Anglo-Saxon verse -- three or more words beginning with the same sound .
Parsing [sent. 431 len. 20]: This is somewhat of the nature of rhyme , and was all our Anglo-Saxon forefathers had of the kind .
Parsing [sent. 432 len. 36]: Their Norman conquerors brought in rhyme , regularity of measure , and division into stanzas , with many refinements of versification now regarded , with some justice and a little more injustice , as peurilities .
Parsing [sent. 433 len. 24]: Strange as it may seem , the peculiar rhythmic movement of the Anglo-Saxon verse is even yet the most popular of all measures .
Parsing [sent. 434 len. 28]: Its representative is now that kind of verse which is measured not by the number of syllables , but by the number of _ accented _ syllables .
Parsing [sent. 435 len. 14]: The bulk of the nation is yet Anglo-Saxon in its blind poetic tastes .
Parsing [sent. 436 len. 34]: Before taking my leave of this mode , I would give one fine specimen from another poem , lately printed , for the first time in full , from Bishop Percy 's manuscript .
Parsing [sent. 437 len. 21]: It may chronologically belong to the beginning of the next century : its proper place in my volume is here .
Parsing [sent. 438 len. 9]: It is called _ Death and Liffe _ .
Parsing [sent. 439 len. 33]: Like Langland 's poem , it is a vision ; but , short as it is in comparison , there is far more poetry in it than in _ Piers Plowman _ .
Parsing [sent. 440 len. 60]: Life is thus described : She was brighter of her blee -LSB- 18 -RSB- than was the bright sun ; Her rudd -LSB- 19 -RSB- redder than the rose that on the rise -LSB- 20 -RSB- hangeth ; Meekly smiling with her mouth , and merry in her looks ; Ever laughing for love , as she like would .
Parsing [sent. 441 len. 19]: Everything bursts into life and blossom at her presence , And the grass that was grey greened belive .
Parsing [sent. 442 len. 3]: _ forthwith .
Parsing [sent. 443 len. 45]: _ But the finest passage is part of Life 's answer to Death , who has been triumphing over her : How didst thou joust at Jerusalem , with Jesu , my Lord , Where thou deemedst his death in one day 's time !
Parsing [sent. 444 len. 3]: _ judgedst .
Parsing [sent. 445 len. 12]: _ There wast thou shamed and shent and stripped for aye !
Parsing [sent. 446 len. 3]: _ rebuked .
Parsing [sent. 447 len. 57]: _ When thou saw the king come with the cross on his shoulder , On the top of Calvary thou camest him against ; Like a traitor untrue , treason thou thought ; Thou laid upon my liege lord loathful hands , Sithen beat him on his body , and buffeted him rightly , _ then .
Parsing [sent. 448 len. 15]: _ Till the railing red blood ran from his sides ; _ pouring down .
Parsing [sent. 449 len. 15]: _ Sith rent him on the rood with full red wounds : _ then .
Parsing [sent. 450 len. 29]: _ To all the woes that him wasted , I wot not few , Then deemedst -LRB- him -RRB- to have been dead , and dressed for ever .
Parsing [sent. 451 len. 18]: But , Death , how didst thou then , with all thy derffe words , _ fierce .
Parsing [sent. 452 len. 33]: _ When thou pricked at his pap with the point of a spear , And touched the tabernacle of his true heart , Where my bower was bigged to abide for ever ?
Parsing [sent. 453 len. 3]: _ built .
Parsing [sent. 454 len. 27]: _ When the glory of his Godhead glinted in thy face , Then wast thou feared of this fare in thy false heart ; _ affair .
Parsing [sent. 455 len. 15]: _ Then thou hied into hell-hole to hide thee belive ; _ at once .
Parsing [sent. 456 len. 30]: _ Thy falchion flew out of thy fist , so fast thou thee hied ; Thou durst not blush once back , for better or worse , _ look .
Parsing [sent. 457 len. 20]: _ But drew thee down full in that deep hell , And bade them bar bigly Belzebub his gates .
Parsing [sent. 458 len. 5]: _ greatly , strongly .
Parsing [sent. 459 len. 15]: _ Then thou told them tidings , that teened them sore ; _ grieved .
Parsing [sent. 460 len. 13]: _ How that king came to kithen his strength , _ show .
Parsing [sent. 461 len. 30]: _ And how she -LSB- 21 -RSB- had beaten thee on thy bent , -LSB- 22 -RSB- and thy brand taken , With everlasting life that longed him till .
Parsing [sent. 462 len. 5]: _ belonged to him .
Parsing [sent. 463 len. 33]: _ When Life has ended her speech to Death , she turns to her own followers and says : -- Therefore be not abashed , my barnes so dear , _ children .
Parsing [sent. 464 len. 13]: _ Of her falchion so fierce , nor of her fell words .
Parsing [sent. 465 len. 27]: She hath no might , nay , no means , no more you to grieve , Nor on your comely corses to clap once her hands .
Parsing [sent. 466 len. 33]: I shall look you full lively , and latch full well , _ search for : And keere ye further of this kithe , -LSB- 23 -RSB- above -LSB- lay hold of .
Parsing [sent. 467 len. 5]: _ the clear skies .
Parsing [sent. 468 len. 75]: I now turn from those poems of national scope and wide social interest , bearing their share , doubtless , in the growth of the great changes that showed themselves at length more than a century after , and from the poem I have just quoted of a yet wider human interest , to one of another tone , springing from the grief that attends love , and the aspiration born of the grief .
Parsing [sent. 469 len. 28]: It is , nevertheless , wide in its scope as the conflict between Death and Life , although dealing with the individual and not with the race .
Parsing [sent. 470 len. 37]: The former poems named of Pierce Ploughman are the cry of John the Baptist in the English wilderness ; this is the longing of Hannah at home , having left her little son in the temple .
Parsing [sent. 471 len. 74]: The latter _ seems _ a poorer matter ; but it is an easier thing to utter grand words of just condemnation , than , in the silence of the chamber , or with the well-known household-life around , forcing upon the consciousness only the law of things seen , to regard with steadfastness the blank left by a beloved form , and believe in the unseen , the marvellous , the eternal .
Parsing [sent. 472 len. 76]: In the midst of `` the light of common day , '' with all the persistently common things pressing upon the despairing heart , to hold fast , after what fashion may be possible , the vanishing song that has changed its key , is indeed a victory over the flesh , however childish the forms in which the faith may embody itself , however weak the logic with which it may defend its intrenchments .
Parsing [sent. 473 len. 16]: The poem which has led me to make these remarks is in many respects noteworthy .
Parsing [sent. 474 len. 15]: It is very different in style and language from any I have yet given .
Parsing [sent. 475 len. 19]: There was little communication to blend the different modes of speech prevailing in different parts of the country .
Parsing [sent. 476 len. 21]: It belongs , -LSB- 24 -RSB- according to students of English , to the Midland dialect of the fourteenth century .
Parsing [sent. 477 len. 6]: The author is beyond conjecture .
Parsing [sent. 478 len. 35]: It is not merely the antiquity of the language that causes its difficulty , but the accumulated weight of artistically fantastic and puzzling requirements which the writer had laid upon himself in its composition .
Parsing [sent. 479 len. 24]: The nature of these I shall be enabled to show by printing the first twelve lines almost as they stand in the manuscript .
Parsing [sent. 480 len. 14]: Perle plesaunte to prynces paye , To clanly clos in golde so clere !
Parsing [sent. 481 len. 33]: Oute of oryent I hardyly saye , Ne proued I neuer her precios pere ; So rounde , so reken in vche araye , So smal , so smothe her sydes were !
Parsing [sent. 482 len. 15]: Quere-so-euer I iugged gemmes gaye , I sette hyr sengeley in synglure : Allas !
Parsing [sent. 483 len. 30]: I leste hyr in on erbere , Thurh gresse to grounde hit fro me yot ; I dewyne for-dolked of luf daungere , Of that pryuy perle with-outen spot .
Parsing [sent. 484 len. 38]: Here it will be observed that the Norman mode -- that of rhymes -- is employed , and that there is a far more careful measure in the line that is found in the poem last quoted .
Parsing [sent. 485 len. 30]: But the rhyming is carried to such an excess as to involve the necessity of constant invention of phrase to meet its requirements -- a fertile source of obscurity .
Parsing [sent. 486 len. 37]: The most difficult form of stanza in respect of rhyme now in use is the Spenserian , in which , consisting of nine lines , four words rhyme together , three words , and two words .
Parsing [sent. 487 len. 28]: But the stanza in the poem before us consists of twelve lines , six of which , two of which , four of which , rhyme together .
Parsing [sent. 488 len. 23]: This we should count hard enough ; but it does not nearly exhaust the tyranny of the problem the author has undertaken .
Parsing [sent. 489 len. 51]: I have already said that one of the essentials of the poetic form in Anglo-Saxon was the commencement of three or more words in the line with the same sound : this peculiarity he has exaggerated : every line has as many words as possible commencing with the same sound .
Parsing [sent. 490 len. 53]: In the first line , for instance , -- and it must be remembered that the author 's line is much shorter than the Anglo-Saxon line , -- there are four words beginning with _ p _ ; in the second , three beginning with _ cl _ , and so on .
Parsing [sent. 491 len. 20]: This , of course , necessitates much not merely of circumlocution , but of contrivance , involving endless obscurity .
Parsing [sent. 492 len. 36]: He has gone on to exaggerate the peculiarities of Norman verse as well ; but I think it better not to run the risk of wearying my reader by pointing out more of his oddities .
Parsing [sent. 493 len. 16]: I will now betake myself to what is far more interesting as well as valuable .
Parsing [sent. 494 len. 17]: The poem sets forth the grief and consolation of a father who has lost his daughter .
Parsing [sent. 495 len. 8]: It is called _ The Pearl _ .
Parsing [sent. 496 len. 48]: Here is a literal rendering , line for line , into modern English words , not modern English speech , of the stanza which I have already given in its original form : Pearl pleasant to prince 's pleasure , Most cleanly closed in gold so clear !
Parsing [sent. 497 len. 25]: Out of the Orient , I boldly say , I never proved her precious equal ; So round , so beautiful in every point !
Parsing [sent. 498 len. 10]: So small , so smooth , her sides were !
Parsing [sent. 499 len. 12]: Wheresoever I judged gemmes gay I set her singly in singleness .
Parsing [sent. 500 len. 2]: Alas !
Parsing [sent. 501 len. 18]: I lost her in an arbour ; Through the grass to the ground it from me went .
Parsing [sent. 502 len. 15]: I pine , sorely wounded by dangerous love Of that especial pearl without spot .
Parsing [sent. 503 len. 13]: The father calls himself a jeweller ; the pearl is his daughter .
Parsing [sent. 504 len. 33]: He has lost the pearl in the grass ; it has gone to the ground , and he can not find it ; that is , his daughter is dead and buried .
Parsing [sent. 505 len. 24]: Perhaps the most touching line is one in which he says to the grave : O moul , thou marrez a myry mele .
Parsing [sent. 506 len. 11]: -LRB- O mould , thou marrest a merry talk . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 507 len. 55]: The poet , who is surely the father himself , can not always keep up the allegory ; his heart burns holes in it constantly ; at one time he says _ she _ , at another _ it _ , and , between the girl and the pearl , the poem is bewildered .
Parsing [sent. 508 len. 49]: But the allegory helps him out with what he means notwithstanding ; for although the highest aim of poetry is to say the deepest things in the simplest manner , humanity must turn from mode to mode , and try a thousand , ere it finds the best .
Parsing [sent. 509 len. 44]: The individual , in his new endeavour to make `` the word cousin to the deed , '' must take up the forms his fathers have left him , and add to them , if he may , new forms of his own .
Parsing [sent. 510 len. 16]: In both the great revivals of literature , the very material of poetry was allegory .
Parsing [sent. 511 len. 99]: The father falls asleep on his child 's grave , and has a dream , or rather a vision , of a country where everything -- after the childish imagination which invents differences instead of discovering harmonies -- is super-naturally beautiful : rich rocks with a gleaming glory , crystal cliffs , woods with blue trunks and leaves of burnished silver , gravel of precious Orient pearls , form the landscape , in which are delicious fruits , and birds of flaming colours and sweet songs : its loveliness no man with a tongue is worthy to describe .
Parsing [sent. 512 len. 41]: He comes to the bank of a river : Swinging sweet the water did sweep With a whispering speech flowing adown ; -LRB- Wyth a rownande rourde raykande aryght -RRB- and the stones at the bottom were shining like stars .
Parsing [sent. 513 len. 22]: It is a noteworthy specimen of the mode in which the imagination works when invention is dissociated from observation and faith .
Parsing [sent. 514 len. 32]: But the sort of way in which some would improve the world now , if they might , is not so very far in advance of this would-be glorification of Nature .
Parsing [sent. 515 len. 50]: The barest heath and sky have lovelinesses infinitely beyond the most gorgeous of such phantasmagoric idealization of her beauties ; and the most wretched condition of humanity struggling for existence contains elements of worth and future development inappreciable by the philanthropy that would elevate them by cultivating their self-love .
Parsing [sent. 516 len. 47]: At the foot of a crystal cliff , on the opposite side of the river , which he can not cross , he sees a maiden sitting , clothed and crowned with pearls , and wearing one pearl of surpassing wonder and spotlessness upon her breast .
Parsing [sent. 517 len. 22]: I now make the spelling and forms of the words as modern as I may , altering the text no further .
Parsing [sent. 518 len. 18]: `` O pearl , '' quoth I , `` in perlés pight , _ pitched , dressed .
Parsing [sent. 519 len. 10]: _ Art thou my pearl that I have plained ?
Parsing [sent. 520 len. 3]: _ mourned .
Parsing [sent. 521 len. 9]: _ Regretted by myn one , on night ?
Parsing [sent. 522 len. 4]: _ by myself .
Parsing [sent. 523 len. 11]: _ Much longing have I for thee layned _ hidden .
Parsing [sent. 524 len. 14]: _ Since into grass thou me a-glyghte ; _ didst glide from me .
Parsing [sent. 525 len. 16]: _ Pensive , payred , I am for-pained , -LSB- 25 -RSB- _ pined away .
Parsing [sent. 526 len. 13]: _ And thou in a life of liking light _ bright pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 527 len. 8]: _ In Paradise-earth , of strife unstrained !
Parsing [sent. 528 len. 5]: _ untortured with strife .
Parsing [sent. 529 len. 15]: _ What wyrde hath hither my jewel vayned , _ destiny : carried off .
Parsing [sent. 530 len. 11]: _ And done me in this del and great danger ?
Parsing [sent. 531 len. 3]: _ sorrow .
Parsing [sent. 532 len. 17]: _ Fro we in twain were towen and twayned , _ since : pulled : divided .
Parsing [sent. 533 len. 9]: _ I have been a joyless jeweller . ''
Parsing [sent. 534 len. 10]: That jewel then in gemmés gente , _ gracious .
Parsing [sent. 535 len. 14]: _ Vered up her vyse with even gray , _ turned : face .
Parsing [sent. 536 len. 29]: _ Set on her crown of pearl orient , And soberly after then gan she say : `` Sir , ye have your tale myse-tente , _ mistaken .
Parsing [sent. 537 len. 19]: _ To say your pearl is all away , That is in coffer so comely clente _ clenched .
Parsing [sent. 538 len. 19]: _ As in this garden gracious gay , Herein to lenge for ever and play , _ abide .
Parsing [sent. 539 len. 15]: _ There mys nor mourning come never -- here , _ where : wrong .
Parsing [sent. 540 len. 15]: _ Here was a forser for thee in faye , _ strong-box : faith .
Parsing [sent. 541 len. 8]: _ If thou wert a gentle jeweller .
Parsing [sent. 542 len. 24]: `` But jeweller gente , if thou shalt lose Thy joy for a gem that thee was lef , _ had left thee .
Parsing [sent. 543 len. 18]: _ Me thinks thee put in a mad purpose , And busiest thee about a reason bref .
Parsing [sent. 544 len. 4]: _ poor object .
Parsing [sent. 545 len. 19]: _ For that thou lostest was but a rose , That flowered and failed as kynd hit gef .
Parsing [sent. 546 len. 5]: _ nature gave it .
Parsing [sent. 547 len. 15]: _ Now through kind of the chest that it gan close , _ nature .
Parsing [sent. 548 len. 31]: _ To a pearl of price it is put in pref ; -LSB- 26 -RSB- And thou hast called thy wyrde a thef , _ doom , fate : theft .
Parsing [sent. 549 len. 11]: _ That ought of nought has made thee , clear !
Parsing [sent. 550 len. 5]: _ something of nothing .
Parsing [sent. 551 len. 14]: _ Thou blamest the bote of thy mischef : _ remedy : hurt .
Parsing [sent. 552 len. 8]: _ Thou art no kyndé jeweller . ''
Parsing [sent. 553 len. 5]: _ natural , reasonable .
Parsing [sent. 554 len. 48]: _ When the father pours out his gladness at the sight of her , she rejoins in these words : `` I hold that jeweller little to praise That loves well that he sees with eye ; And much to blame , and uncortoyse , _ uncourteous .
Parsing [sent. 555 len. 13]: _ That leves our Lord would make a lie , _ believes .
Parsing [sent. 556 len. 13]: _ That lelly hyghte your life to raise _ who truly promised .
Parsing [sent. 557 len. 12]: _ Though fortune did your flesh to die ; _ caused .

Parsing [sent. 562 len. 14]: _ To leve no tale be true to tryghe , _ trust in .
Parsing [sent. 563 len. 10]: _ But that his one skill may deme . ''
Parsing [sent. 564 len. 16]: -LSB- 28 -RSB- Much conversation follows , the glorified daughter rebuking and instructing her father .
Parsing [sent. 565 len. 32]: He prays for a sight of the heavenly city of which she has been speaking , and she tells him to walk along the bank until he comes to a hill .
Parsing [sent. 566 len. 25]: In recording what he saw from the hill , he follows the description of the New Jerusalem given in the Book of the Revelation .
Parsing [sent. 567 len. 17]: He sees the Lamb and all his company , and with them again his lost Pearl .
Parsing [sent. 568 len. 42]: But it was not his prince 's pleasure that he should cross the stream ; for when his eyes and ears were so filled with delight that he could no longer restrain the attempt , he awoke out of his dream .
Parsing [sent. 569 len. 15]: My head upon that hill was laid There where my pearl to groundé strayed .
Parsing [sent. 570 len. 11]: I wrestled and fell in great affray , _ fear .
Parsing [sent. 571 len. 19]: _ And sighing to myself I said , `` Now all be to that prince 's paye . ''
Parsing [sent. 572 len. 3]: _ pleasure .

Parsing [sent. 574 len. 16]: `` As in water face is to face , so the heart of man . ''
Parsing [sent. 575 len. 23]: Out of the far past comes the cry of bereavement mingled with the prayer for hope : we hear , and lo !
Parsing [sent. 576 len. 13]: it is the cry and the prayer of a man like ourselves .
Parsing [sent. 577 len. 36]: From the words of the greatest man of his age , let me now gather two rich blossoms of utterance , presenting an embodiment of religious duty and aspiration , after a very practical fashion .
Parsing [sent. 578 len. 17]: I refer to two short lyrics , little noted , although full of wisdom and truth .
Parsing [sent. 579 len. 26]: They must be accepted as the conclusions of as large a knowledge of life in diversified mode as ever fell to the lot of man .
Parsing [sent. 580 len. 5]: GOOD COUNSEL OF CHAUCER .
Parsing [sent. 581 len. 13]: Fly from the press , and dwell with soothfastness ; _ truthfulness .
Parsing [sent. 582 len. 37]: _ Suffice -LSB- 29 -RSB- unto thy good , though it be small ; For hoard hath hate , and climbing tickleness ; -LSB- 30 -RSB- Praise hath envy , and weal is blent over all .

Parsing [sent. 599 len. 5]: This needs no comment .
Parsing [sent. 600 len. 14]: Even the remark that every line is worth meditation may well appear superfluous .
Parsing [sent. 601 len. 54]: One little fact only with regard to the rhymes , common to this and the next poem , and usual enough in Norman verse , may be pointed out , namely , that every line in the stanza ends with the same rhyme-sound as the corresponding line in each of the other stanzas .
Parsing [sent. 602 len. 15]: A reference to either of the poems will at once show what I mean .
Parsing [sent. 603 len. 16]: The second is superior , inasmuch as it carries one thought through the three stanzas .
Parsing [sent. 604 len. 24]: It is entitled _ A Balade made by Chaucer , teaching what is gentilnesse , or whom is worthy to be called gentill .
Parsing [sent. 605 len. 24]: _ The first stock-father of gentleness -- _ ancestor of the race What man desireth gentle for to be -LSB- of the gentle .

Parsing [sent. 609 len. 5]: _ although he wear .
Parsing [sent. 610 len. 13]: _ The first stock was full of righteousness ; _ the progenitor .
Parsing [sent. 611 len. 28]: _ True of his word , sober , piteous , and free ; Clean of his ghost , and loved busi-ness , _ pure in his spirit .
Parsing [sent. 612 len. 22]: _ Against the vice of sloth in honesty ; And but his heir love virtue as did he , _ except .
Parsing [sent. 613 len. 21]: _ He is not gentle , though he rich seem , All wear he mitre , crown , or diadem .

Parsing [sent. 617 len. 11]: _ All wear he mitre , crown , or diadem .
Parsing [sent. 618 len. 21]: I can come to no other conclusion than that by _ the first stock-father _ Chaucer means our Lord Jesus .
Parsing [sent. 619 len. 3]: CHAPTER III .
Parsing [sent. 620 len. 4]: THE FIFTEENTH CENTURY .
Parsing [sent. 621 len. 42]: After the birth of a Chaucer , a Shakspere , or a Milton , it is long before the genial force of a nation can again culminate in such a triumph : time is required for the growth of the conditions .
Parsing [sent. 622 len. 26]: Between the birth of Chaucer and the birth of Shakspere , his sole equal , a period of more than two centuries had to elapse .
Parsing [sent. 623 len. 41]: It is but small compensation for this , that the more original , that is simple , natural , and true to his own nature a man is , the more certain is he to have a crowd of imitators .
Parsing [sent. 624 len. 14]: I do not say that such are of no use in the world .
Parsing [sent. 625 len. 30]: They do not indeed advance art , but they widen the sphere of its operation ; for many will talk with the man who know nothing of the master .
Parsing [sent. 626 len. 24]: Too often intending but their own glory , they point the way to the source of it , and are straightway themselves forgotten .
Parsing [sent. 627 len. 22]: Very little of the poetry of the fifteenth century is worthy of a different fate from that which has befallen it .
Parsing [sent. 628 len. 28]: Possibly the Wars of the Roses may in some measure account for the barrenness of the time ; but I do not think they will explain it .
Parsing [sent. 629 len. 34]: In the midst of the commotions of the seventeenth century we find Milton , the only English poet of whom we are yet sure as worthy of being named with Chaucer and Shakspere .
Parsing [sent. 630 len. 17]: It is in quality , however , and not in quantity that the period is deficient .
Parsing [sent. 631 len. 14]: It had a good many writers of poetry , some of them prolific .
Parsing [sent. 632 len. 28]: John Lydgate , the monk of Bury , a great imitator of Chaucer , was the principal of these , and wrote an enormous quantity of verse .
Parsing [sent. 633 len. 36]: We shall find for our use enough as it were to keep us alive in passing through this desert to the Paradise of the sixteenth century -- a land indeed flowing with milk and honey .
Parsing [sent. 634 len. 33]: For even in the desert of the fifteenth are spots luxuriant with the rich grass of language , although they greet the eye with few flowers of individual thought or graphic speech .
Parsing [sent. 635 len. 22]: Rather than give portions of several of Lydgate 's poems , I will give one entire -- the best I know .
Parsing [sent. 636 len. 11]: It is entitled , _ Thonke God of alle _ .
Parsing [sent. 637 len. 8]: -LSB- 36 -RSB- THANK GOD FOR ALL .
Parsing [sent. 638 len. 77]: By a way wandering as I went , Well sore I sorrowed , for sighing sad ; Of hard haps that I had hent Mourning me made almost mad ; -LSB- 37 -RSB- Till a letter all one me lad -LSB- 38 -RSB- , That well was written on a wall , A blissful word that on I rad -LSB- 39 -RSB- , That alway said , ` Thank God for -LSB- 40 -RSB- all . '
Parsing [sent. 639 len. 40]: And yet I read furthermore -LSB- 41 -RSB- -- Full good intent I took there till -LSB- 42 -RSB- : Christ may well your state restore ; Nought is to strive against his will ; _ it is useless .
Parsing [sent. 640 len. 17]: _ He may us spare and also spill : Think right well we be his thrall .
Parsing [sent. 641 len. 3]: _ slaves .
Parsing [sent. 642 len. 16]: _ What sorrow we suffer , loud or still , Alway thank God for all .
Parsing [sent. 643 len. 29]: Though thou be both blind and lame , Or any sickness be on thee set , Thou think right well it is no shame -- _ think thou .
Parsing [sent. 644 len. 13]: _ The grace of God it hath thee gret -LSB- 43 -RSB- .
Parsing [sent. 645 len. 12]: In sorrow or care though ye be knit , _ snared .
Parsing [sent. 646 len. 12]: _ And worldés weal be from thee fall , _ fallen .
Parsing [sent. 647 len. 13]: _ I can not say thou mayst do bet , _ better .
Parsing [sent. 648 len. 8]: _ But alway thank God for all .
Parsing [sent. 649 len. 45]: Though thou wield this world 's good , And royally lead thy life in rest , Well shaped of bone and blood , None the like by east nor west ; Think God thee sent as him lest ; _ as it pleased him .
Parsing [sent. 650 len. 19]: _ Riches turneth as a ball ; In all manner it is the best _ in every condition .
Parsing [sent. 651 len. 8]: _ Alway to thank God for all .
Parsing [sent. 652 len. 35]: If thy good beginneth to pass , And thou wax a poor man , Take good comfort and bear good face , And think on him that all good wan ; _ did win .
Parsing [sent. 653 len. 25]: _ Christ himself forsooth began -- He may renew both bower and hall : No better counsel I ne kan _ am capable of .
Parsing [sent. 654 len. 8]: _ But alway thank God for all .
Parsing [sent. 655 len. 58]: Think on Job that was so rich ; He waxed poor from day to day ; His beastés died in each ditch ; His cattle vanished all away ; He was put in poor array , Neither in purple nor in pall , But in simple weed , as clerkes say , _ clothes : learned men .
Parsing [sent. 656 len. 9]: _ And alway he thanked God for all .
Parsing [sent. 657 len. 38]: For Christés love so do we ; -LSB- 44 -RSB- He may both give and take ; In what mischief that we in be , _ whatever trouble we He is mighty enough our sorrow to slake .
Parsing [sent. 658 len. 4]: -LSB- be in .
Parsing [sent. 659 len. 20]: _ Full good amends he will us make , And we to him cry or call : _ if .
Parsing [sent. 660 len. 20]: _ What grief or woe that do thee thrall , -LSB- 45 -RSB- Yet alway thank God for all .
Parsing [sent. 661 len. 18]: Though thou be in prison cast , Or any distress men do thee bede , _ offer .
Parsing [sent. 662 len. 54]: _ For Christés love yet be steadfast , And ever have mind on thy creed ; Think he faileth us never at need , The dearworth duke that deem us shall ; -LSB- 46 -RSB- When thou art sorry , thereof take heed , -LSB- 47 -RSB- And alway thank God for all .
Parsing [sent. 663 len. 26]: Though thy friendes from thee fail , And death by rene hend -LSB- 48 -RSB- their life , Why shouldest thou then weep or wail ?
Parsing [sent. 664 len. 13]: It is nought against God to strive : _ it is useless .
Parsing [sent. 665 len. 21]: _ Himself maked both man and wife -- To his bliss he bring us all : _ may he bring .
Parsing [sent. 666 len. 10]: _ However thou thole or thrive , _ suffer .
Parsing [sent. 667 len. 7]: _ Alway thank God for all .
Parsing [sent. 668 len. 32]: What diverse sonde -LSB- 49 -RSB- that God thee send , Here or in any other place , Take it with good intent ; The sooner God will send his grace .
Parsing [sent. 669 len. 11]: Though thy body be brought full base , _ low .
Parsing [sent. 670 len. 24]: _ Let not thy heart adown fall , But think that God is where he was , And alway thank God for all .

Parsing [sent. 675 len. 38]: _ For Cristés love , be not so wild , But rule thee by reason within and without ; And take in good heart and mind The sonde that God sent all about ; _ the gospel .
Parsing [sent. 676 len. 4]: _ -LRB- ? -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 677 len. 15]: Then dare I say withouten doubt , That in heaven is made thy stall .
Parsing [sent. 678 len. 7]: _ place , seat , room .
Parsing [sent. 679 len. 12]: _ Rich and poor that low will lowte , _ bow .
Parsing [sent. 680 len. 7]: _ Alway thank God for all .
Parsing [sent. 681 len. 19]: I can not say there is much poetry in this , but there is much truth and wisdom .
Parsing [sent. 682 len. 32]: There is the finest poetry , however , too , in the line -- I give it now letter for letter : -- But think that God ys ther he was .
Parsing [sent. 683 len. 26]: There is poetry too in the line , if I interpret it rightly as intending the gospel -- The sonde that God sent al abowte .
Parsing [sent. 684 len. 18]: I shall now make a few extracts from poems of the same century whose authors are unknown .
Parsing [sent. 685 len. 10]: -LSB- 51 -RSB- A good many such are extant .
Parsing [sent. 686 len. 58]: With regard to the similarity of those I choose , I would remark , that not only will the poems of the same period necessarily resemble each other , but , where the preservation of any has depended upon the choice and transcription of one person , these will in all probability resemble each other yet more .
Parsing [sent. 687 len. 31]: Here are a few verses from a hymn headed _ The Sweetness of Jesus _ : -- If I for kindness should love my kin , _ for natural reasons .
Parsing [sent. 688 len. 23]: Then me thinketh in my thought -LSB- Kind is nature , _ By kindly skill I should begin _ by natural judgment .
Parsing [sent. 689 len. 40]: _ At him that hath me made of nought ; His likeness he set my soul within , And all this world for me hath wrought ; As father he fondid my love to win , _ set about .
Parsing [sent. 690 len. 9]: _ For to heaven he hath me brought .
Parsing [sent. 691 len. 12]: Our brother and sister he is by skill , _ reason .
Parsing [sent. 692 len. 15]: _ For he so said , and lerid us that lore , _ taught .
Parsing [sent. 693 len. 17]: _ That whoso wrought his Father 's will , Brethren and sisters to him they wore .
Parsing [sent. 694 len. 3]: _ were .
Parsing [sent. 695 len. 25]: _ My kind also he took ther-tille ; _ my nature also he took Full truly trust I him therefore -LSB- for that purpose .
Parsing [sent. 696 len. 12]: _ That he will never let me spill , _ perish .
Parsing [sent. 697 len. 9]: _ But with his mercy salve my sore .
Parsing [sent. 698 len. 11]: With lovely lore his works to fill , _ fulfil .
Parsing [sent. 699 len. 15]: _ Well ought I , wretch , if I were kind -- _ natural .
Parsing [sent. 700 len. 17]: _ Night and day to work his will , And ever have that Lord in mind .
Parsing [sent. 701 len. 10]: But ghostly foes grieve me ill , _ spiritual .
Parsing [sent. 702 len. 22]: _ And my frail flesh maketh me blind ; Therefore his mercy I take me till , _ betake me to .
Parsing [sent. 703 len. 9]: _ For better bote can I none find .
Parsing [sent. 704 len. 3]: _ aid .
Parsing [sent. 705 len. 20]: _ In my choice of stanzas I have to keep in view some measure of completeness in the result .
Parsing [sent. 706 len. 12]: These poems , however , are mostly very loose in structure .
Parsing [sent. 707 len. 14]: This , while it renders choice easy , renders closeness of unity impossible .
Parsing [sent. 708 len. 41]: From a poem headed -- again from the last line of each stanza -- _ Be my comfort , Christ Jesus , _ I choose the following four , each possessing some remarkable flavour , tone , or single touch .
Parsing [sent. 709 len. 14]: Note the alliteration in the lovely line , beginning `` Bairn y-born . ''
Parsing [sent. 710 len. 75]: The whole of the stanza in which we find it , sounds so strangely fresh in the midst of its antiquated tones , that we can hardly help asking whether it can be only the quaintness of the expression that makes the feeling appear more real , or whether in very truth men were not in those days nearer in heart , as well as in time , to the marvel of the Nativity .
Parsing [sent. 711 len. 39]: In the next stanza , how oddly the writer forgets that Jesus himself was a Jew , when , embodying the detestation of Christian centuries in one line , he says , And tormented with many a Jew !
Parsing [sent. 712 len. 28]: In the third stanza , I consider the middle quatrain , that is , the four lines beginning `` Out of this world , '' perfectly grand .
Parsing [sent. 713 len. 37]: The oddness of the last line but one of the fourth stanza is redeemed by the wonderful reality it gives to the faith of the speaker : `` See my sorrow , and say Ho ! ''
Parsing [sent. 714 len. 13]: stopping it as one would call after a man and stop him .
Parsing [sent. 715 len. 11]: Jesus , thou art wisdom of wit , _ understanding .
Parsing [sent. 716 len. 8]: _ Of thy Father full of might !
Parsing [sent. 717 len. 15]: Man 's soul -- to save it , In poor apparel thou wert pight .
Parsing [sent. 718 len. 16]: _ pitched , placed , Jesus , thou wert in cradle knit , -LSB- dressed .
Parsing [sent. 719 len. 27]: _ In weed wrapped both day and night ; originally , _ dress of In Bethlehem born , as the gospel writ , -LSB- any kind .
Parsing [sent. 720 len. 9]: _ With angels ' song , and heaven-light .
Parsing [sent. 721 len. 20]: Bairn y-born of a beerde bright , -LSB- 52 -RSB- Full courteous was thy comely cus : _ kiss .
Parsing [sent. 722 len. 16]: _ Through virtue of that sweet light , So be my comfort , Christ Jesus .
Parsing [sent. 723 len. 26]: Jesus , that wert of yearis young , Fair and fresh of hide and hue , When thou wert in thraldom throng , _ driven .
Parsing [sent. 724 len. 34]: _ And tormented with many a Jew , When blood and water were out-wrung , For beating was thy body blue ; As a clot of clay thou wert for-clong , _ shrunk .
Parsing [sent. 725 len. 10]: _ So dead in trough then men thee threw .
Parsing [sent. 726 len. 3]: _ coffin .
Parsing [sent. 727 len. 16]: _ But grace from thy grave grew : Thou rose up quick comfort to us .
Parsing [sent. 728 len. 3]: _ living .
Parsing [sent. 729 len. 17]: _ For her love that this counsel knew , So be my comfort , Christ Jesus .
Parsing [sent. 730 len. 27]: Jesus , soothfast God and man , Two kinds knit in one person , The wonder-work that thou began Thou hast fulfilled in flesh and bone .
Parsing [sent. 731 len. 26]: Out of this world wightly thou wan , _ thou didst win , or make Lifting up thyself alone ; -LSB- thy way , powerfully .
Parsing [sent. 732 len. 14]: _ For mightily thou rose and ran Straight unto thy Father on throne .
Parsing [sent. 733 len. 33]: Now dare man make no more moan -- For man it is thou wroughtest thus , And God with man is made at one ; So be my comfort , Christ Jesus .
Parsing [sent. 734 len. 34]: Jesu , my sovereign Saviour , Almighty God , there ben no mo : _ there are no more -- thou Christ , thou be my governor ; -LSB- art all in all .
Parsing [sent. 735 len. 3]: -LRB- ? -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 736 len. 9]: _ Thy faith let me not fallen fro .
Parsing [sent. 737 len. 31]: _ from _ Jesu , my joy and my succour , In my body and soul also , God , thou be my strongest food , the rhyme fails here .
Parsing [sent. 738 len. 9]: And wisse thou me when me is woe .
Parsing [sent. 739 len. 5]: _ think on me .
Parsing [sent. 740 len. 37]: _ Lord , thou makest friend of foe , Let me not live in languor thus , But see my sorrow , and say now `` Ho , '' And be my comfort , Christ Jesus .
Parsing [sent. 741 len. 41]: Of fourteen stanzas called _ Richard de Castre 's Prayer to Jesus _ , I choose five from the latter half , where the prayer passes from his own spiritual necessities , very tenderly embodied , to those of others .
Parsing [sent. 742 len. 55]: It does our hearts good to see the clouded sun of prayer for oneself break forth in the gladness of blessed entreaty for all men , for them that make Him angry , for saints in trouble , for the country torn by war , for the whole body of Christ and its unity .
Parsing [sent. 743 len. 66]: After the stanza -- Jesus , for the deadly tears That thou sheddest for my guilt , Hear and speed my prayérs And spare me that I be not spilt ; the best that is in the suppliant shines out thus Jesu , for them I thee beseech That wrathen thee in any wise ; Withhold from them thy hand of wreche , _ vengeance .
Parsing [sent. 744 len. 9]: _ And let them live in thy service .
Parsing [sent. 745 len. 26]: Jesu , most comfort for to see Of thy saintis every one , Comfort them that careful be , And help them that be woe-begone .
Parsing [sent. 746 len. 32]: Jesu , keep them that be good , And amend them that have grieved thee ; And send them fruits of earthly food , As each man needeth in his degree .
Parsing [sent. 747 len. 11]: Jesu , that art , withouten lees , _ lies .
Parsing [sent. 748 len. 21]: _ Almighty God in trinity , Cease these wars , and send us peace , With lasting love and charity .
Parsing [sent. 749 len. 10]: Jesu , that art the ghostly stone _ spiritual .
Parsing [sent. 750 len. 12]: _ Of all holy church in middle-erde , _ the world .
Parsing [sent. 751 len. 17]: _ Bring thy folds and flocks in one , And rule them rightly with one herd .
Parsing [sent. 752 len. 44]: We now approach the second revival of literature , preceded in England by the arrival of the art of printing ; after which we find ourselves walking in a morning twilight , knowing something of the authors as well as of their work .
Parsing [sent. 753 len. 10]: I have little more to offer from this century .
Parsing [sent. 754 len. 17]: There are a few religious poems by John Skelton , who was tutor to Henry VIII .
Parsing [sent. 755 len. 20]: But such poetry , though he was a clergyman , was not much in Skelton 's manner of mind .
Parsing [sent. 756 len. 10]: We have far better of a similar sort already .
Parsing [sent. 757 len. 18]: A new sort of dramatic representation had by this time greatly encroached upon the old Miracle Plays .
Parsing [sent. 758 len. 10]: The fresh growth was called Morals or Moral Plays .
Parsing [sent. 759 len. 18]: In them we see the losing victory of invention over the imagination that works with given facts .
Parsing [sent. 760 len. 39]: No doubt in the Moral Plays there is more exercise of intellect as well as of ingenuity ; for they consist of metaphysical facts turned into individual existences by personification , and their relations then dramatized by allegory .
Parsing [sent. 761 len. 17]: But their poetry is greatly inferior both in character and execution to that of the Miracles .
Parsing [sent. 762 len. 133]: They have a religious tendency , as everything moral must have , and sometimes they go even farther , as in one , for instance , called _ The Castle of Perseverance _ , in which we have all the cardinal virtues and all the cardinal sins contending for the possession of _ Humanum Genus _ , the _ Human Race _ being presented as a new-born child , who grows old and dies in the course of the play ; but it was a great stride in art when human nature and human history began again to be exemplified after a simple human fashion , in the story , that is , of real men and women , instead of by allegorical personifications of the analysed and abstracted constituents of them .
Parsing [sent. 763 len. 47]: Allegory has her place , and a lofty one , in literature ; but when her plants cover the garden and run to seed , Allegory herself is ashamed of her children : the loveliest among them are despised for the general obtrusiveness of the family .
Parsing [sent. 764 len. 23]: Imitation not only brings the thing imitated into disrepute , but tends to destroy what original faculty the imitator may have possessed .
Parsing [sent. 765 len. 3]: CHAPTER IV .
Parsing [sent. 766 len. 6]: INTRODUCTION TO THE ELIZABETHAN ERA .
Parsing [sent. 767 len. 33]: Poets now began to write more smoothly -- not a great virtue , but indicative of a growing desire for finish , which , in any art , is a great virtue .
Parsing [sent. 768 len. 54]: No doubt smoothness is often confounded with , and mistaken for finish ; but you might have a mirror-like polish on the surface of a statue , for instance , and yet the marble be full of inanity , or vagueness , or even vulgarity of result -- irrespective altogether of its idea .
Parsing [sent. 769 len. 78]: The influence of Italian poetry reviving once more in the country , roused such men as Wyat and Surrey to polish the sound of their verses ; but smoothness , I repeat , is not melody , and where the attention paid to the outside of the form results in flatness , and , still worse , in obscurity , as is the case with both of these poets , little is gained and much is lost .
Parsing [sent. 770 len. 89]: Each has paraphrased portions of Scripture , but with results of little value ; and there is nothing of a religious nature I care to quote from either , except these five lines from an epistle of Sir Thomas Wyat 's : Thyself content with that is thee assigned , And use it well that is to thee allotted ; Then seek no more out of thyself to find The thing that thou hast sought so long before , For thou shalt feel it sticking in thy mind .
Parsing [sent. 771 len. 57]: Students of versification will allow me to remark that Sir Thomas was the first English poet , so far as I know , who used the _ terza rima _ , Dante 's chief mode of rhyming : the above is too small a fragment to show that it belongs to a poem in that manner .
Parsing [sent. 772 len. 24]: It has never been popular in England , although to my mind it is the finest form of continuous rhyme in any language .
Parsing [sent. 773 len. 38]: Again , we owe his friend Surrey far more for being the first to write English blank verse , whether invented by himself or not , than for any matter he has left us in poetic shape .
Parsing [sent. 774 len. 12]: This period is somewhat barren of such poetry as we want .
Parsing [sent. 775 len. 30]: Here is a portion of the Fifty-first Psalm , translated amongst others into English verse by John Croke , Master in Chancery , in the reign of Henry VIII .
Parsing [sent. 776 len. 23]: Open my lips first to confess My sin conceived inwardly ; And my mouth after shall express Thy laud and praises outwardly .
Parsing [sent. 777 len. 29]: If I should offer for my sin , Or sacrifice do unto thee Of beast or fowl , I should begin To stir thy wrath more towards me .
Parsing [sent. 778 len. 17]: Offer we must for sacrifice A troubled mind with sorrow 's smart : Canst thou refuse ?
Parsing [sent. 779 len. 11]: Nay , nor despise The humble and the contrite heart .
Parsing [sent. 780 len. 26]: To us of Sion that be born , If thou thy favour wilt renew , The broken sowle , the temple torn , _ threshold .
Parsing [sent. 781 len. 10]: _ The walls and all shall be made new .
Parsing [sent. 782 len. 28]: The sacrifice then shall we make Of justice and of pure intent ; And all things else thou wilt well take That we shall offer or present .
Parsing [sent. 783 len. 15]: In the works of George Gascoigne I find one poem fit for quoting here .
Parsing [sent. 784 len. 31]: He is not an interesting writer , and , although his verse is very good , there is little likelihood of its ever being read more than it is now .
Parsing [sent. 785 len. 24]: The date of his birth is unknown , but probably he was in his teens when Surrey was beheaded in the year 1547 .
Parsing [sent. 786 len. 25]: He is the only poet whose style reminds me of his , although the _ wherefore _ will hardly be evident from my quotation .
Parsing [sent. 787 len. 9]: It is equally flat , but more articulate .
Parsing [sent. 788 len. 11]: I need not detain my reader with remarks upon him .
Parsing [sent. 789 len. 38]: The fact is , I am glad to have something , if not `` a cart-load of wholesome instructions , '' to cast into this Slough of Despond , should it be only to see it vanish .
Parsing [sent. 790 len. 9]: The poem is called GASCOIGNE 'S GOOD MORROW .
Parsing [sent. 791 len. 57]: You that have spent the silent night In sleep and quiet rest , And joy to see the cheerful light That riseth in the east ; Now clear your voice , now cheer your heart ; Come help me now to sing ; Each willing wight come bear a part , To praise the heavenly King .
Parsing [sent. 792 len. 51]: And you whom care in prison keeps , Or sickness doth suppress , Or secret sorrow breaks your sleeps , Or dolours do distress ; Yet bear a part in doleful wise ; Yea , think it good accord , And acceptable sacrifice , Each sprite to praise the Lord .
Parsing [sent. 793 len. 49]: The dreadful night with darksomeness Had overspread the light , And sluggish sleep with drowsiness Had overpressed our might : A glass wherein you may behold Each storm that stops our breath , Our bed the grave , our clothes like mould , And sleep like dreadful death .
Parsing [sent. 794 len. 54]: Yet as this deadly night did last But for a little space , And heavenly day , now night is past , Doth shew his pleasant face ; So must we hope to see God 's face At last in heaven on high , When we have changed this mortal place For immortality .
Parsing [sent. 795 len. 11]: This is not so bad , but it is enough .
Parsing [sent. 796 len. 8]: There are six stanzas more of it .
Parsing [sent. 797 len. 15]: I transcribe yet another , that my reader may enjoy a smile in passing .
Parsing [sent. 798 len. 64]: He is `` moralizing '' the aspects of morning : The carrion crow , that loathsome beast , Which cries against the rain , Both for his hue and for the rest , The Devil resembleth plain ; And as with guns we kill the crow , For spoiling our relief , The Devil so must we overthrow , With gunshot of belief .
Parsing [sent. 799 len. 21]: So fares the wit , when it walks abroad to do its business without the heart that should inspire it .
Parsing [sent. 800 len. 61]: Here is one good stanza from his _ De Profundis : _ But thou art good , and hast of mercy store ; Thou not delight ` st to see a sinner fall ; Thou hearkenest first , before we come to call ; Thine ears are set wide open evermore ; Before we knock thou comest to the door .
Parsing [sent. 801 len. 13]: Thou art more prest to hear a sinner cry , _ ready .
Parsing [sent. 802 len. 12]: _ Than he is quick to climb to thee on high .
Parsing [sent. 803 len. 25]: Thy mighty name be praised then alway : Let faith and fear True witness bear How fast they stand which on thy mercy stay .
Parsing [sent. 804 len. 14]: Here follow two of unknown authorship , belonging apparently to the same period .
Parsing [sent. 805 len. 8]: THAT EACH THING IS HURT OF ITSELF .
Parsing [sent. 806 len. 15]: Why fearest thou the outward foe , When thou thyself thy harm dost feed ?
Parsing [sent. 807 len. 18]: Of grief or hurt , of pain or woe , Within each thing is sown the seed .
Parsing [sent. 808 len. 34]: So fine was never yet the cloth , No smith so hard his iron did beat , But th ' one consuméd was with moth , Th ' other with canker all to-freate .
Parsing [sent. 809 len. 4]: _ fretted away .
Parsing [sent. 810 len. 31]: _ The knotty oak and wainscot old Within doth eat the silly worm ; -LSB- 53 -RSB- Even so a mind in envy rolled Always within it self doth burn .
Parsing [sent. 811 len. 14]: Thus every thing that nature wrought , Within itself his hurt doth bear !
Parsing [sent. 812 len. 15]: No outward harm need to be sought , Where enemies be within so near .
Parsing [sent. 813 len. 49]: Lest this poem should appear to any one hardly religious enough for the purpose of this book , I would remark that it reminds me of what our Lord says about the true source of defilement : it is what is bred in the man that denies him .
Parsing [sent. 814 len. 35]: Our Lord himself taught a divine morality , which is as it were the body of love , and is as different from mere morality as `` the living body is from the dead .
Parsing [sent. 815 len. 6]: TOTUS MUNDUS IN MALIGNO POSITUS .
Parsing [sent. 816 len. 9]: The whole world lieth in the Evil One .
Parsing [sent. 817 len. 32]: Complain we may ; much is amiss ; Hope is nigh gone to have redress ; These days are ill , nothing sure is ; Kind heart is wrapt in heaviness .
Parsing [sent. 818 len. 31]: The stern is broke , the sail is rent , _ helm or rudder -- the The ship is given to wind and wave ; -LSB- thing to steer with .
Parsing [sent. 819 len. 20]: _ All help is gone , the rock present , That will be lost , what man can save ?
Parsing [sent. 820 len. 7]: _ that which will be lost .
Parsing [sent. 821 len. 12]: _ When power lacks care and forceth not , _ careth .
Parsing [sent. 822 len. 14]: _ When care is feeble and may not , _ is not able .
Parsing [sent. 823 len. 18]: _ When might is slothful and will not , Weeds may grow where good herbs can not .
Parsing [sent. 824 len. 24]: Wily is witty , brainsick is wise ; _ wiliness is counted Truth is folly , and might is right ; -LSB- prudence .
Parsing [sent. 825 len. 19]: _ Words are reason , and reason is lies ; The bad is good , darkness is light .
Parsing [sent. 826 len. 16]: Order is broke in things of weight : Measure and mean who doth nor flee ?
Parsing [sent. 827 len. 16]: _ who does not avoid Two things prevail , money and sleight ; -LSB- moderation ?
Parsing [sent. 828 len. 9]: _ To seem is better than to be .
Parsing [sent. 829 len. 34]: Folly and falsehood prate apace ; Truth under bushel is fain to creep ; Flattery is treble , pride sings the bass , The mean , the best part , scant doth peep .
Parsing [sent. 830 len. 33]: With floods and storms thus be we tost : Awake , good Lord , to thee we cry ; Our ship is almost sunk and lost ; Thy mercy help our misery .
Parsing [sent. 831 len. 42]: Man 's strength is weak ; man 's wit is dull ; Man 's reason is blind these things t ` amend : Thy hand , O Lord , of might is full -- Awake betimes , and help us send .
Parsing [sent. 832 len. 32]: In thee we trust , and in no wight ; Save us , as chickens under the hen ; Our crookedness thou canst make right -- Glory to thee for aye .
Parsing [sent. 833 len. 2]: Amen .
Parsing [sent. 834 len. 17]: The apprehensions of the wiser part of the nation have generally been ahead of its hopes .
Parsing [sent. 835 len. 28]: Every age is born with an ideal ; but instead of beholding that ideal in the future where it lies , it throws it into the past .
Parsing [sent. 836 len. 19]: Hence the lapse of the nation must appear tremendous , even when she is making her best progress .
Parsing [sent. 837 len. 7]: CHAPTER V. SPENSER AND HIS FRIENDS .
Parsing [sent. 838 len. 22]: We have now arrived at the period of English history in every way fullest of marvel -- the period of Elizabeth .
Parsing [sent. 839 len. 27]: As in a northern summer the whole region bursts into blossom at once , so with the thought and feeling of England in this glorious era .
Parsing [sent. 840 len. 33]: The special development of the national mind with which we are now concerned , however , did not by any means arrive at its largest and clearest result until the following century .
Parsing [sent. 841 len. 7]: Still its progress is sufficiently remarkable .
Parsing [sent. 842 len. 71]: For , while everything that bore upon the mental development of the nation must bear upon its poetry , the fresh vigour given by the doctrines of the Reformation to the sense of personal responsibility , and of immediate relation to God , with the grand influences , both literary and spiritual , of the translated , printed , and studied Bible , operated more immediately upon its devotional utterance .
Parsing [sent. 843 len. 23]: Towards the close of the sixteenth century , we begin to find such verse as I shall now present to my readers .
Parsing [sent. 844 len. 28]: Only I must first make a few remarks upon the great poem of the period : I mean , of course , _ The Faerie Queen _ .
Parsing [sent. 845 len. 39]: I dare not begin to set forth after any fashion the profound religious truth contained in this poem ; for it would require a volume larger than this to set forth even that of the first book adequately .
Parsing [sent. 846 len. 28]: In this case it is well to remember that the beginning of comment , as well as of strife , is like the letting out of water .
Parsing [sent. 847 len. 29]: The direction in which the wonderful allegory of the latter moves may be gathered from the following stanza , the first of the eighth canto : Ay me !
Parsing [sent. 848 len. 28]: how many perils do enfold The righteous man to make him daily fail ; Were not that heavenly grace doth him uphold , _ it _ understood .
Parsing [sent. 849 len. 9]: And steadfast Truth acquit him out of all !
Parsing [sent. 850 len. 49]: Her love is firm , her care continual , So oft as he , through his own foolish pride Or weakness , is to sinful bands made thrall : Else should this Redcross Knight in bands have died , For whose deliverance she this Prince doth thither guide .
Parsing [sent. 851 len. 27]: Nor do I judge it good to spend much of my space upon remarks personal to those who have not been especially writers of sacred verse .
Parsing [sent. 852 len. 54]: When we come to the masters of such song , we can not speak of their words without speaking of themselves ; but when in the midst of many words those of the kind we seek are few , the life of the writer does not justify more than a passing notice here .
Parsing [sent. 853 len. 52]: We know but little of Spenser 's history : if we might know all , I do not fear that we should find anything to destroy the impression made by his verse -- that he was a Christian gentleman , a noble and pure-minded man , of highest purposes and aims .
Parsing [sent. 854 len. 19]: His style is injured by the artistic falsehood of producing antique effects in the midst of modern feeling .
Parsing [sent. 855 len. 61]: -LSB- 54 -RSB- It was scarcely more justifiable , for instance , in Spenser 's time than it would be in ours to use _ glitterand _ for _ glittering _ ; or to return to a large use of alliteration , three , four , sometimes even five words in the same line beginning with the same consonant sound .
Parsing [sent. 856 len. 22]: Everything should look like what it is : prose or verse should be written in the language of its own era .
Parsing [sent. 857 len. 38]: No doubt the wide-spreading roots of poetry gather to it more variety of expression than prose can employ ; and the very nature of verse will make it free of times and seasons , harmonizing many opposites .
Parsing [sent. 858 len. 38]: Hence , through its mediation , without discord , many fine old words , by the loss of which the language has grown poorer and feebler , might be honourably enticed to return even into our prose .
Parsing [sent. 859 len. 14]: But nothing ought to be brought back _ because _ it is old .
Parsing [sent. 860 len. 30]: That it is out of use is a presumptive argument that it ought to remain out of use : good reasons must be at hand to support its reappearance .
Parsing [sent. 861 len. 49]: I must not , however , enlarge upon this wide-reaching question ; for of the two portions of Spenser 's verse which I shall quote , one of them is not at all , the other not so much as his great poem , affected with this whim .
Parsing [sent. 862 len. 21]: The first I give is a sonnet , one of eighty-eight which he wrote to his wife before their marriage .
Parsing [sent. 863 len. 33]: Apparently disappointed in early youth , he did not fall in love again , -- at least there is no sign of it that I know , -- till he was middle-aged .
Parsing [sent. 864 len. 14]: But then -- woman was never more grandly wooed than was his Elizabeth .
Parsing [sent. 865 len. 44]: I know of no marriage-present worthy to be compared with the Epithalamion which he gave her `` in lieu of many ornaments , '' -- one of the most stately , melodious , and tender poems in the world , I fully believe .
Parsing [sent. 866 len. 20]: But now for the sonnet -- the sixty-eighth of the _ Amoretti _ : Most glorious Lord of Life !
Parsing [sent. 867 len. 70]: that , on this day , Didst make thy triumph over death and sin , And having harrowed hell , didst bring away Captivity thence captive , us to win : This joyous day , dear Lord , with joy begin ; And grant that we , for whom thou diddest die , Being with thy dear blood clean washed from sin , May live for ever in felicity !
Parsing [sent. 868 len. 36]: And that thy love we weighing worthily , May likewise love thee for the same again ; And for thy sake , that all like dear didst buy , With love may one another entertain .
Parsing [sent. 869 len. 23]: So let us love , dear love , like as we ought : Love is the lesson which the Lord us taught .
Parsing [sent. 870 len. 51]: Those who have never felt the need of the divine , entering by the channel of will and choice and prayer , for the upholding , purifying , and glorifying of that which itself first created human , will consider this poem untrue , having its origin in religious affectation .
Parsing [sent. 871 len. 5]: Others will think otherwise .
Parsing [sent. 872 len. 33]: The greater part of what I shall next quote is tolerably known even to those who have made little study of our earlier literature , yet it may not be omitted here .
Parsing [sent. 873 len. 46]: It is from _ An Hymne of Heavenly Love _ , consisting of forty-one stanzas , written in what was called _ Rime Royal _ -- a favourite with Milton , and , next to the Spenserian , in my opinion the finest of stanzas .
Parsing [sent. 874 len. 6]: Its construction will reveal itself .
Parsing [sent. 875 len. 26]: I take two stanzas from the beginning of the hymn , then one from the heart of it , and the rest from the close .
Parsing [sent. 876 len. 28]: It gives no feeling of an outburst of song , but rather of a brooding chant , most quiet in virtue of the depth of its thoughtfulness .
Parsing [sent. 877 len. 32]: Indeed , all his rhythm is like the melodies of water , and I could quote at least three passages in which he speaks of rhythmic movements and watery progressions together .
Parsing [sent. 878 len. 22]: His thoughts , and hence his words , flow like a full , peaceful stream , diffuse , with plenteousness unrestrained .
Parsing [sent. 879 len. 6]: AN HYMN OF HEAVENLY LOVE .
Parsing [sent. 880 len. 69]: Before this world 's great frame , in which all things Are now contained , found any being place , Ere flitting Time could wag his eyas -LSB- 55 -RSB- wings About that mighty bound which doth embrace The rolling spheres , and parts their hours by space , That high eternal power , which now doth move In all these things , moved in itself by love .
Parsing [sent. 881 len. 66]: It loved itself , because itself was fair , For fair is loved ; and of itself begot Like to itself his eldest son and heir , Eternal , pure , and void of sinful blot , The firstling of his joy , in whom no jot Of love 's dislike or pride was to be found , Whom he therefore with equal honour crowned .
Parsing [sent. 882 len. 33]: * * * * * Out of the bosom of eternal bliss , In which he reignéd with his glorious Sire , He down descended , like a most demisse _ humble .
Parsing [sent. 883 len. 38]: _ And abject thrall , in flesh 's frail attire , That he for him might pay sin 's deadly hire , And him restore unto that happy state In which he stood before his hapless fate .
Parsing [sent. 884 len. 11]: * * * * * O blessed well of love !
Parsing [sent. 885 len. 5]: O flower of grace !
Parsing [sent. 886 len. 4]: O glorious Morning-Star !
Parsing [sent. 887 len. 5]: O Lamp of Light !
Parsing [sent. 888 len. 9]: Most lively image of thy Father 's face !
Parsing [sent. 889 len. 9]: Eternal King of Glory , Lord of might !
Parsing [sent. 890 len. 10]: Meek Lamb of God , before all worlds behight !
Parsing [sent. 891 len. 3]: _ promised .
Parsing [sent. 892 len. 11]: _ How can we thee requite for all this good ?
Parsing [sent. 893 len. 10]: Or what can prize that thy most precious blood ?
Parsing [sent. 894 len. 5]: _ equal in value .
Parsing [sent. 895 len. 26]: _ Yet nought thou ask ` st in lieu of all this love But love of us for guerdon of thy pain : Ay me !
Parsing [sent. 896 len. 8]: what can us less than that behove ?
Parsing [sent. 897 len. 25]: -LSB- 56 -RSB- Had he required life of -LSB- 57 -RSB- us again , Had it been wrong to ask his own with gain ?
Parsing [sent. 898 len. 21]: He gave us life , he it restored lost ; Then life were least , that us so little cost .
Parsing [sent. 899 len. 26]: But he our life hath left unto us free -- Free that was thrall , and blessed that was banned ; _ enslaved ; cursed .
Parsing [sent. 900 len. 49]: _ Nor aught demands but that we loving be , As he himself hath loved us aforehand , And bound thereto with an eternal band -- Him first to love that us -LSB- 58 -RSB- so dearly bought , And next our brethren , to his image wrought .
Parsing [sent. 901 len. 70]: Him first to love great right and reason is , Who first to us our life and being gave , And after , when we faréd had amiss , Us wretches from the second death did save ; And last , the food of life , which now we have , Even he himself , in his dear sacrament , To feed our hungry souls , unto us lent .
Parsing [sent. 902 len. 50]: Then next , to love our brethren that were made Of that self mould , and that self Maker 's hand , That -LSB- 59 -RSB- we , and to the same again shall fade , Where they shall have like heritage of land , _ the same grave-room .
Parsing [sent. 903 len. 27]: _ However here on higher steps we stand ; Which also were with selfsame price redeemed , That we , however , of us light esteemed .
Parsing [sent. 904 len. 3]: _ as .
Parsing [sent. 905 len. 67]: _ And were they not , yet since that loving Lord Commanded us to love them for his sake , Even for his sake , and for his sacred word , Which in his last bequest he to us spake , We should them love , and with their needs partake ; _ share their Knowing that , whatsoe'er to them we give , -LSB- needs .
Parsing [sent. 906 len. 12]: _ We give to him by whom we all do live .
Parsing [sent. 907 len. 11]: Such mercy he by his most holy rede _ instruction .
Parsing [sent. 908 len. 26]: _ Unto us taught , and to approve it true , Ensampled it by his most righteous deed , Shewing us mercy , miserable crew !
Parsing [sent. 909 len. 30]: That we the like should to the wretches -LSB- 60 -RSB- shew , And love our brethren ; thereby to approve How much himself that loved us we love .
Parsing [sent. 910 len. 7]: Then rouse thyself , O earth !
Parsing [sent. 911 len. 26]: out of thy soil , In which thou wallowest like to filthy swine , And dost thy mind in dirty pleasures moyle , _ defile .
Parsing [sent. 912 len. 34]: _ Unmindful of that dearest Lord of thine ; Lift up to him thy heavy clouded eyne , That thou this sovereign bounty mayst behold , And read through love his mercies manifold .
Parsing [sent. 913 len. 25]: Begin from first , where he encradled was In simple cratch , wrapt in a wad of hay , _ a rack or crib .
Parsing [sent. 914 len. 47]: _ Between the toilful ox and humble ass ; And in what rags , and in what base array The glory of our heavenly riches lay , When him the silly -LSB- 61 -RSB- shepherds came to see , Whom greatest princes sought on lowest knee .
Parsing [sent. 915 len. 48]: From thence read on the story of his life , His humble carriage , his unfaulty ways , His cankered foes , his fights , his toil , his strife , His pains , his poverty , his sharp assays , _ temptations _ or _ trials .
Parsing [sent. 916 len. 27]: _ Through which he passed his miserable days , Offending none , and doing good to all , Yet being maliced both by great and small .
Parsing [sent. 917 len. 72]: And look at last , how of most wretched wights He taken was , betrayed , and false accused ; How with most scornful taunts and fell despites He was reviled , disgraced , and foul abused ; How scourged , how crowned , how buffeted , how bruised ; And , lastly , how ` twixt robbers crucified , With bitter wounds through hands , through feet , and side !
Parsing [sent. 918 len. 68]: * * * * * With sense whereof whilst so thy softened spirit Is inly touched , and humbled with meek zeal Through meditation of his endless merit , Lift up thy mind to th ' author of thy weal , And to his sovereign mercy do appeal ; Learn him to love that lovéd thee so dear , And in thy breast his blessed image bear .
Parsing [sent. 919 len. 25]: With all thy heart , with all thy soul and mind , Thou must him love , and his behests embrace ; _ commands .
Parsing [sent. 920 len. 44]: _ All other loves with which the world doth blind Weak fancies , and stir up affections base , Thou must renounce and utterly displace , And give thyself unto him full and free , That full and freely gave himself to thee .
Parsing [sent. 921 len. 67]: * * * * * Thenceforth all world 's desire will in thee die , And all earth 's glory , on which men do gaze , Seem dust and dross in thy pure-sighted eye , Compared to that celestial beauty 's blaze , Whose glorious beams all fleshly sense do daze With admiration of their passing light , Blinding the eyes and lumining the sprite .
Parsing [sent. 922 len. 18]: Then shalt thy ravished soul inspiréd be With heavenly thoughts far above human skill , _ reason .
Parsing [sent. 923 len. 43]: _ And thy bright radiant eyes shall plainly see The Idea of his pure glory present still Before thy face , that all thy spirits shall fill With sweet enragement of celestial love , Kindled through sight of those fair things above .
Parsing [sent. 924 len. 63]: There is a companion to the poem of which these verses are a portion , called _ An Hymne of Heavenly Beautie _ , filled like this , and like two others on Beauty and Love , with Platonic forms both of thought and expression ; but I have preferred quoting a longer part of the former to giving portions of both .
Parsing [sent. 925 len. 43]: My reader will recognize in the extract a fuller force of intellect brought to bear on duty ; although it would be unwise to take a mind like Spenser 's for a type of more than the highest class of the age .
Parsing [sent. 926 len. 34]: Doubtless the division in the country with regard to many of the Church 's doctrines had its part in bringing out and strengthening this tendency to reasoning which is so essential to progress .
Parsing [sent. 927 len. 107]: Where religion itself is not the most important thing with the individual , all reasoning upon it must indeed degenerate into strifes of words , _ vermiculate _ questions , as Lord Bacon calls them -- such , namely , as like the hoarded manna reveal the character of the owner by breeding of worms -- yet on no questions may the light of the candle of the Lord , that is , the human understanding , be cast with greater hope of discovery than on those of religion , those , namely , that bear upon man 's relation to God and to his fellow .
Parsing [sent. 928 len. 82]: The most partial illumination of this region , the very cause of whose mystery is the height and depth of its _ truth _ , is of more awful value to the human being than perfect knowledge , if such were possible , concerning everything else in the universe ; while , in fact , in this very region , discovery may bring with it a higher kind of conviction than can accompany the results of investigation in any other direction .
Parsing [sent. 929 len. 31]: In these grandest of all thinkings , the great men of this time showed a grandeur of thought worthy of their surpassing excellence in other noblest fields of human labour .
Parsing [sent. 930 len. 8]: They thought greatly because they aspired greatly .
Parsing [sent. 931 len. 11]: Sir Walter Raleigh was a personal friend of Edmund Spenser .
Parsing [sent. 932 len. 21]: They were almost of the same age , the former born in 1552 , the latter in the following year .
Parsing [sent. 933 len. 27]: A writer of magnificent prose , itself full of religion and poetry both in thought and expression , he has not distinguished himself greatly in verse .
Parsing [sent. 934 len. 22]: There is , however , one remarkable poem fit for my purpose , which I can hardly doubt to be his .
Parsing [sent. 935 len. 11]: It is called _ Sir Walter Raleigh 's Pilgrimage _ .
Parsing [sent. 936 len. 26]: The probability is that it was written just after his condemnation in 1603 -- although many years passed before his sentence was carried into execution .
Parsing [sent. 937 len. 49]: Give me my scallop-shell -LSB- 62 -RSB- of Quiet ; My staff of Faith to walk upon ; My scrip of Joy , immortal diet ; My bottle of Salvation ; My gown of Glory , hope 's true gage ; And thus I 'll take my pilgrimage .
Parsing [sent. 938 len. 78]: Blood must be my body 's balmer , -- No other balm will there be given -- Whilst my soul , like quiet palmer , Travelleth towards the land of Heaven ; Over the silver mountains , Where spring the nectar fountains -- There will I kiss The bowl of Bliss , And drink mine everlasting fill Upon every milken hill : My soul will be a-dry before , But after , it will thirst no more .
Parsing [sent. 939 len. 56]: Then by that happy blissful day , More peaceful pilgrims I shall see , That have cast off their rags of clay , And walk apparelled fresh like me : I 'll take them first , To quench their thirst , And taste of nectar 's suckets , _ sweet things -- things to suck .
Parsing [sent. 940 len. 17]: _ At those clear wells Where sweetness dwells , Drawn up by saints in crystal buckets .
Parsing [sent. 941 len. 27]: And when our bottles and all we Are filled with immortality , Then the blessed paths we 'll travel , Strowed with rubies thick as gravel .
Parsing [sent. 942 len. 4]: Ceilings of diamonds !
Parsing [sent. 943 len. 3]: sapphire floors !
Parsing [sent. 944 len. 9]: High walls of coral , and pearly bowers !
Parsing [sent. 945 len. 57]: -- From thence to Heaven 's bribeless hall , Where no corrupted voices brawl ; No conscience molten into gold ; No forged accuser bought or sold ; No cause deferred ; no vain-spent journey ; For there Christ is the King 's Attorney , Who pleads for all without degrees , _ irrespective of rank .
Parsing [sent. 946 len. 10]: _ And he hath angels , but no fees .
Parsing [sent. 947 len. 33]: And when the grand twelve million jury Of our sins , with direful fury , ` Gainst our souls black verdicts give , Christ pleads his death , and then we live .
Parsing [sent. 948 len. 14]: Be thou my speaker , taintless Pleader , Unblotted Lawyer , true Proceeder !
Parsing [sent. 949 len. 18]: Thou giv ` st salvation even for alms , -- Not with a bribéd lawyer 's palms .
Parsing [sent. 950 len. 77]: And this is my eternal plea To him that made heaven , earth , and sea , That , since my flesh must die so soon , And want a head to dine next noon , -- Just at the stroke , when my veins start and spread , Set on my soul an everlasting head : Then am I ready , like a palmer fit , To tread those blest paths which before I writ .
Parsing [sent. 951 len. 18]: Of death and judgment , heaven and hell Who oft doth think , must needs die well .
Parsing [sent. 952 len. 34]: This poem is a somewhat strange medley , with a confusion of figure , and a repeated failure in dignity , which is very far indeed from being worthy of Raleigh 's prose .
Parsing [sent. 953 len. 41]: But it is very remarkable how wretchedly some men will show , who , doing their own work well , attempt that for which practice has not -- to use a word of the time -- _ enabled _ them .
Parsing [sent. 954 len. 32]: There is real power in the poem , however , and the confusion is far more indicative of the pleased success of an unaccustomed hand than of incapacity for harmonious work .
Parsing [sent. 955 len. 99]: Some of the imagery , especially the `` crystal buckets , '' will suggest those grotesque drawings called _ Emblems _ , which were much in use before and after this period , and , indeed , were only a putting into visible shape of such metaphors and similes as some of the most popular poets of the time , especially Doctor Donne , indulged in ; while the profusion of earthly riches attributed to the heavenly paths and the places of repose on the journey , may well recall Raleigh 's own descriptions of South American glories .
Parsing [sent. 956 len. 42]: Englishmen of that era believed in an earthly Paradise beyond the Atlantic , the wonderful reports of whose magnificence had no doubt a share in lifting the imaginations and hopes of the people to the height at which they now stood .
Parsing [sent. 957 len. 56]: There may be an appearance of irreverence in the way in which he contrasts the bribeless Hall of Heaven with the proceedings at his own trial , where he was browbeaten , abused , and , from the very commencement , treated as a guilty man by Sir Edward Coke , the king 's attorney .
Parsing [sent. 958 len. 14]: He even puns with the words _ angels _ and _ fees _ .
Parsing [sent. 959 len. 32]: Burning from a sense of injustice , however , and with the solemnity of death before him , he could not be guilty of _ conscious _ irreverence , at least .
Parsing [sent. 960 len. 91]: But there is another remark I have to make with regard to the matter , which will bear upon much of the literature of the time : even the great writers of that period had such a delight in words , and such a command over them , that like their skilful horsemen , who enjoyed making their steeds show off the fantastic paces they had taught them , they played with the words as they passed through their hands , tossing them about as a juggler might his balls .
Parsing [sent. 961 len. 36]: But even herein the true master of speech showed his masterdom : his play must not be by-play ; it must contribute to the truth of the idea which was taking form in those words .
Parsing [sent. 962 len. 19]: We shall see this more plainly when we come to transcribe some of Sir Philip Sidney 's work .
Parsing [sent. 963 len. 7]: There is no irreverence in it .
Parsing [sent. 964 len. 75]: Nor can I take it as any sign of hardness that Raleigh should treat the visual image of his own anticipated death with so much coolness , if the writer of a little elegy on his execution , when Raleigh was fourteen years older than at the presumed date of the foregoing verses , describes him truly when he says : I saw in every stander-by Pale death , life only in thy eye .
Parsing [sent. 965 len. 9]: The following hymn is also attributed to Raleigh .
Parsing [sent. 966 len. 34]: If it has less brilliance of fancy , it has none of the faults of the preceding , and is far more artistic in construction and finish , notwithstanding a degree of irregularity .
Parsing [sent. 967 len. 56]: Rise , oh my soul , with thy desires to heaven ; And with divinest contemplation use Thy time , where time 's eternity is given ; And let vain thoughts no more thy thoughts abuse , But down in darkness let them lie : So live thy better , let thy worse thoughts die !
Parsing [sent. 968 len. 39]: And thou , my soul , inspired with holy flame , View and review , with most regardful eye , That holy cross , whence thy salvation came , On which thy Saviour and thy sin did die !
Parsing [sent. 969 len. 20]: For in that sacred object is much pleasure , And in that Saviour is my life , my treasure .
Parsing [sent. 970 len. 63]: To thee , O Jesus , I direct my eyes ; To thee my hands , to thee my humble knees , To thee my heart shall offer sacrifice ; To thee my thoughts , who my thoughts only sees -- To thee myself , -- myself and all I give ; To thee I die ; to thee I only live !
Parsing [sent. 971 len. 26]: See what an effect of stately composure quiet artistic care produces , and how it leaves the ear of the mind in a satisfied peace !
Parsing [sent. 972 len. 10]: There are a few fine lines in the poem .
Parsing [sent. 973 len. 20]: The last two lines of the first stanza are admirable ; the last two of the second very weak .
Parsing [sent. 974 len. 7]: The last stanza is good throughout .
Parsing [sent. 975 len. 14]: But it would be very unfair to judge Sir Walter by his verse .
Parsing [sent. 976 len. 28]: His prose is infinitely better , and equally displays the devout tendency of his mind -- a tendency common to all the great men of that age .
Parsing [sent. 977 len. 18]: The worst I know of him is the selfishly prudent advice he left behind for his son .
Parsing [sent. 978 len. 29]: No doubt he had his faults , but we must not judge a man even by what he says in an over-anxiety for the prosperity of his child .
Parsing [sent. 979 len. 19]: Another remarkable fact in the history of those great men is that they were all men of affairs .
Parsing [sent. 980 len. 20]: Raleigh was a soldier , a sailor , a discoverer , a politician , as well as an author .
Parsing [sent. 981 len. 22]: His friend Spenser was first secretary to Lord Grey when he was Governor of Ireland , and afterwards Sheriff of Cork .
Parsing [sent. 982 len. 12]: He has written a large treatise on the state of Ireland .
Parsing [sent. 983 len. 46]: But of all the men of the age no one was more variously gifted , or exercised those gifts in more differing directions , than the man who of them all was most in favour with queen , court , and people -- Philip Sidney .
Parsing [sent. 984 len. 21]: I could write much to set forth the greatness , culture , balance , and scope of this wonderful man .
Parsing [sent. 985 len. 63]: Renowned over Europe for his person , for his dress , for his carriage , for his speech , for his skill in arms , for his horsemanship , for his soldiership , for his statesmanship , for his learning , he was beloved for his friendship , his generosity , his steadfastness , his simplicity , his conscientiousness , his religion .
Parsing [sent. 986 len. 34]: Amongst the lamentations over his death printed in Spenser 's works , there is one poem by Matthew Roydon , a few verses of which I shall quote , being no vain eulogy .
Parsing [sent. 987 len. 35]: Describing his personal appearance , he says : A sweet , attractive kind of grace , A full assurance given by looks , Continual comfort in a face , The lineaments of Gospel books !
Parsing [sent. 988 len. 17]: -- I trow , that countenance can not lie Whose thoughts are legible in the eye .
Parsing [sent. 989 len. 30]: Was ever eye did see that face , Was ever ear did hear that tongue , Was ever mind did mind his grace That ever thought the travel long ?
Parsing [sent. 990 len. 16]: But eyes and ears , and every thought , Were with his sweet perfections caught .
Parsing [sent. 991 len. 13]: His _ Arcadia _ is a book full of wisdom and beauty .
Parsing [sent. 992 len. 32]: None of his writings were printed in his lifetime ; but the _ Arcadia _ was for many years after his death one of the most popular books in the country .
Parsing [sent. 993 len. 21]: His prose , as prose , is not equal to his friend Raleigh 's , being less condensed and stately .
Parsing [sent. 994 len. 72]: It is too full of fancy in thought and freak in rhetoric to find now-a-days more than a very limited number of readers ; and a good deal of the verse that is set in it , is obscure and uninteresting , partly from some false notions of poetic composition which he and his friend Spenser entertained when young ; but there is often an exquisite art in his other poems .
Parsing [sent. 995 len. 30]: The first I shall transcribe is a sonnet , to which the Latin words printed below it might be prefixed as a title : _ Splendidis longum valedico nugis .
Parsing [sent. 996 len. 8]: _ A LONG FAREWELL TO GLITTERING TRIFLES .
Parsing [sent. 997 len. 40]: Leave me , O love , which reachest but to dust ; And thou , my mind , aspire to higher things ; Grow rich in that which never taketh rust : What ever fades but fading pleasure brings .
Parsing [sent. 998 len. 40]: Draw in thy beams , and humble all thy might To that sweet yoke where lasting freedoms be ; Which breaks the clouds , and opens forth the light That doth both shine and give us sight to see .
Parsing [sent. 999 len. 44]: Oh take fast hold ; let that light be thy guide , In this small course which birth draws out to death ; And think how evil -LSB- 63 -RSB- becometh him to slide Who seeketh heaven , and comes of heavenly breath .
Parsing [sent. 1000 len. 19]: Then farewell , world ; thy uttermost I see : Eternal love , maintain thy life in me .
Parsing [sent. 1001 len. 89]: Before turning to the treasury of his noblest verse , I shall give six lines from a poem in the _ Arcadia _ -- chiefly for the sake of instancing what great questions those mighty men delighted in : What essence destiny hath ; if fortune be or no ; Whence our immortal souls to mortal earth do stow -LSB- 64 -RSB- : What life it is , and how that all these lives do gather , With outward maker 's force , or like an inward father .
Parsing [sent. 1002 len. 28]: Such thoughts , me thought , I thought , and strained my single mind , Then void of nearer cares , the depth of things to find .
Parsing [sent. 1003 len. 39]: Lord Bacon was not the only one , in such an age , to think upon the mighty relations of physics and metaphysics , or , as Sidney would say , `` of naturall and supernaturall philosophic . ''
Parsing [sent. 1004 len. 23]: For a man to do his best , he must be upheld , even in his speculations , by those around him .
Parsing [sent. 1005 len. 19]: In the specimen just given , we find that our religious poetry has gone down into the deeps .
Parsing [sent. 1006 len. 31]: There are indications of such a tendency in the older times , but neither then were the questions so articulate , nor were the questioners so troubled for an answer .
Parsing [sent. 1007 len. 52]: The alternative expressed in the middle couplet seems to me the most imperative of all questions -- both for the individual and for the church : Is man fashioned by the hands of God , as a potter fashioneth his vessel ; or do we indeed come forth from his heart ?
Parsing [sent. 1008 len. 11]: Is power or love the making might of the universe ?
Parsing [sent. 1009 len. 14]: He who answers this question aright possesses the key to all righteous questions .
Parsing [sent. 1010 len. 23]: Sir Philip and his sister Mary , Countess of Pembroke , made between them a metrical translation of the Psalms of David .
Parsing [sent. 1011 len. 47]: It can not be determined which are hers and which are his ; but if I may conclude anything from a poem by the sister , to which I shall by and by refer , I take those I now give for the brother 's work .
Parsing [sent. 1012 len. 26]: The souls of the following psalms have , in the version I present , transmigrated into fairer forms than I have found them occupy elsewhere .
Parsing [sent. 1013 len. 16]: Here is a grand hymn for the whole world : _ Sing unto the Lord .
Parsing [sent. 1014 len. 4]: _ PSALM XCVI .
Parsing [sent. 1015 len. 33]: Sing , and let your song be new , Unto him that never endeth ; Sing all earth , and all in you -- Sing to God , and bless his name .
Parsing [sent. 1016 len. 16]: Of the help , the health he sendeth , Day by day new ditties frame .
Parsing [sent. 1017 len. 19]: Make each country know his worth : Of his acts the wondered story Paint unto each people forth .
Parsing [sent. 1018 len. 21]: For Jehovah great alone , All the gods , for awe and glory , Far above doth hold his throne .
Parsing [sent. 1019 len. 13]: For but idols , what are they Whom besides mad earth adoreth ?
Parsing [sent. 1020 len. 8]: He the skies in frame did lay .
Parsing [sent. 1021 len. 19]: Grace and honour are his guides ; Majesty his temple storeth ; Might in guard about him bides .
Parsing [sent. 1022 len. 3]: Kindreds come !
Parsing [sent. 1023 len. 16]: Jehovah give -- O give Jehovah all together , Force and fame whereso you live .
Parsing [sent. 1024 len. 23]: Give his name the glory fit : Take your off ` rings , get you thither , Where he doth enshrined sit .
Parsing [sent. 1025 len. 14]: Go , adore him in the place Where his pomp is most displayed .
Parsing [sent. 1026 len. 27]: Earth , O go with quaking pace , Go proclaim Jehovah king : Stayless world shall now be stayed ; Righteous doom his rule shall bring .
Parsing [sent. 1027 len. 23]: Starry roof and earthy floor , Sea , and all thy wideness yieldeth , Now rejoice , and leap , and roar .
Parsing [sent. 1028 len. 25]: Leafy infants of the wood , Fields , and all that on you feedeth , Dance , O dance , at such a good !
Parsing [sent. 1029 len. 6]: For Jehovah cometh , lo !
Parsing [sent. 1030 len. 6]: Lo to reign Jehovah cometh !
Parsing [sent. 1031 len. 7]: Under whom you all shall go .
Parsing [sent. 1032 len. 21]: He the world shall rightly guide -- Truly , as a king becometh , For the people 's weal provide .
Parsing [sent. 1033 len. 33]: Attempting to give an ascending scale of excellence -- I do not mean in subject but in execution -- I now turn to the national hymn , _ God is our Refuge .
Parsing [sent. 1034 len. 4]: _ PSALM XLIV .
Parsing [sent. 1035 len. 56]: God gives us strength , and keeps us sound -- A present help when dangers call ; Then fear not we , let quake the ground , And into seas let mountains fall ; Yea so let seas withal In watery hills arise , As may the earthly hills appal With dread and dashing cries .
Parsing [sent. 1036 len. 28]: For lo , a river , streaming joy , With purling murmur safely slides , That city washing from annoy , In holy shrine where God resides .
Parsing [sent. 1037 len. 12]: God in her centre bides : What can this city shake ?
Parsing [sent. 1038 len. 13]: God early aids and ever guides : Who can this city take ?
Parsing [sent. 1039 len. 32]: When nations go against her bent , And kings with siege her walls enround ; The void of air his voice doth rent , Earth fails their feet with melting ground .
Parsing [sent. 1040 len. 28]: To strength and keep us sound , The God of armies arms ; Our rock on Jacob 's God we found , Above the reach of harms .
Parsing [sent. 1041 len. 17]: O come with me , O come , and view The trophies of Jehovah 's hand !
Parsing [sent. 1042 len. 8]: What wrecks from him our foes pursue !
Parsing [sent. 1043 len. 8]: How clearly he hath purged our land !
Parsing [sent. 1044 len. 27]: By him wars silent stand : He brake the archer 's bow , Made chariot 's wheel a fiery brand , And spear to shivers go .
Parsing [sent. 1045 len. 33]: Be still , saith he ; know , God am I ; Know I will be with conquest crowned Above all nations -- raiséd high , High raised above this earthly round .
Parsing [sent. 1046 len. 28]: To strength and keep us sound , The God of armies arms ; Our rock on Jacob 's God we found , Above the reach of harms .
Parsing [sent. 1047 len. 12]: `` The God of armies arms '' is a grand line .
Parsing [sent. 1048 len. 28]: Now let us have a hymn of Nature -- a far finer , I think , than either of the preceding : _ Praise waiteth for thee .
Parsing [sent. 1049 len. 4]: _ PSALM LXV .
Parsing [sent. 1050 len. 36]: Sion it is where thou art praiséd , Sion , O God , where vows they pay thee : There all men 's prayers to thee raiséd , Return possessed of what they pray thee .
Parsing [sent. 1051 len. 18]: There thou my sins , prevailing to my shame , Dost turn to smoke of sacrificing flame .
Parsing [sent. 1052 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 1053 len. 10]: he of bliss is not deceivéd , _ disappointed .
Parsing [sent. 1054 len. 42]: _ Whom chosen thou unto thee takest ; And whom into thy court receivéd , Thou of thy checkrole -LSB- 65 -RSB- number makest : The dainty viands of thy sacred store Shall feed him so he shall not hunger more .
Parsing [sent. 1055 len. 51]: From thence it is thy threat ` ning thunder -- Lest we by wrong should be disgracéd -- Doth strike our foes with fear and wonder , O thou on whom their hopes are placéd , Whom either earth doth stedfastly sustain , Or cradle rocks the restless wavy plain .
Parsing [sent. 1056 len. 10]: Thy virtue stays the mighty mountains , _ power .
Parsing [sent. 1057 len. 9]: _ Girded with power , with strength abounding .
Parsing [sent. 1058 len. 21]: The roaring dam of watery fountains _ the `` dam of fountains '' Thy beck doth make surcease her sounding .
Parsing [sent. 1059 len. 5]: -LSB- is the ocean .
Parsing [sent. 1060 len. 21]: _ When stormy uproars toss the people 's brain , That civil sea to calm thou bring ` st again .
Parsing [sent. 1061 len. 9]: _ political , as opposed -LSB- to natural .
Parsing [sent. 1062 len. 56]: _ Where earth doth end with endless ending , All such as dwell , thy signs affright them ; And in thy praise their voices spending , Both houses of the sun delight them -- Both whence he comes , when early he awakes , And where he goes , when evening rest he takes .
Parsing [sent. 1063 len. 46]: Thy eye from heaven this land beholdeth , Such fruitful dews down on it raining , That storehouse-like her lap enfoldeth Assuréd hope of ploughman 's gaining : Thy flowing streams her drought doth temper so , That buried seed through yielding grave doth grow .
Parsing [sent. 1064 len. 20]: Drunk is each ridge of thy cup drinking ; Each clod relenteth at thy dressing ; _ groweth soft .
Parsing [sent. 1065 len. 17]: _ Thy cloud-borne waters inly sinking , Fair spring sprouts forth , blest with thy blessing .
Parsing [sent. 1066 len. 22]: The fertile year is with thy bounty crowned ; And where thou go ` st , thy goings fat the ground .
Parsing [sent. 1067 len. 31]: Plenty bedews the desert places ; A hedge of mirth the hills encloseth ; The fields with flocks have hid their faces ; A robe of corn the valleys clotheth .
Parsing [sent. 1068 len. 25]: Deserts , and hills , and fields , and valleys all , Rejoice , shout , sing , and on thy name do call .
Parsing [sent. 1069 len. 23]: The first stanza seems to me very fine , especially the verse , `` Return possessed of what they pray thee . ''
Parsing [sent. 1070 len. 32]: The third stanza might have been written after the Spanish Philip 's Armada , but both King David and Sir Philip Sidney were dead before God brake that archer 's bow .
Parsing [sent. 1071 len. 37]: -LSB- 66 -RSB- The fourth line of the next stanza is a noteworthy instance of the sense gathering to itself the sound , and is in lovely contrast with the closing line of the same stanza .
Parsing [sent. 1072 len. 49]: One of the most remarkable specimens I know of the play with words of which I have already spoken as common even in the serious writings of this century , is to be found in the next line : `` Where earth doth end with endless ending . ''
Parsing [sent. 1073 len. 69]: David , regarding the world as a flat disc , speaks of the _ ends _ of the earth : Sidney , knowing it to be a globe , uses the word of the Psalmist , but re-moulds and changes the form of it , with a power fantastic , almost capricious in its wilfulness , yet causing it to express the fact with a marvel of precision .
Parsing [sent. 1074 len. 29]: We _ see _ that the earth ends ; we can not reach the end we see ; therefore the `` earth doth end with endless ending . ''
Parsing [sent. 1075 len. 53]: It is a case of that contradiction in the form of the words used , which brings out a truth in another plane as it were ; -- a paradox in words , not in meaning , for the words can bear no meaning but the one which reveals its own reality .
Parsing [sent. 1076 len. 18]: The following little psalm , _ The Lord reigneth _ , is a thunderous organ-blast of praise .
Parsing [sent. 1077 len. 17]: The repetition of words in the beginning of the second stanza produces a remarkably fine effect .
Parsing [sent. 1078 len. 3]: PSALM XCIII .
Parsing [sent. 1079 len. 23]: Clothed with state , and girt with might , Monarch-like Jehovah reigns ; He who earth 's foundation pight -- _ pitched .
Parsing [sent. 1080 len. 36]: _ Pight at first , and yet sustains ; He whose stable throne disdains Motion 's shock and age 's flight ; He who endless one remains One , the same , in changeless plight .
Parsing [sent. 1081 len. 30]: Rivers -- yea , though rivers roar , Roaring though sea-billows rise , Vex the deep , and break the shore -- Stronger art thou , Lord of skies !
Parsing [sent. 1082 len. 23]: Firm and true thy promise lies Now and still as heretofore : Holy worship never dies In thy house where we adore .
Parsing [sent. 1083 len. 30]: I close my selections from Sidney with one which I consider the best of all : it is the first half of _ Lord , thou hast searched me .
Parsing [sent. 1084 len. 4]: _ PSALM CXXXIX .
Parsing [sent. 1085 len. 45]: O Lord , in me there lieth nought But to thy search revealed lies ; For when I sit Thou markest it ; No less thou notest when I rise : Yea , closest closet of my thought Hath open windows to thine eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1086 len. 51]: Thou walkest with me when I walk When to my bed for rest I go , I find thee there , And every where : Not youngest thought in me doth grow , No , not one word I cast to talk But , yet unuttered , thou dost know .
Parsing [sent. 1087 len. 39]: If forth I march , thou goest before ; If back I turn , thou com ` st behind : So forth nor back Thy guard I lack ; Nay , on me too thy hand I find .
Parsing [sent. 1088 len. 14]: Well I thy wisdom may adore , But never reach with earthy mind .
Parsing [sent. 1089 len. 17]: To shun thy notice , leave thine eye , O whither might I take my way ?
Parsing [sent. 1090 len. 4]: To starry sphere ?
Parsing [sent. 1091 len. 5]: Thy throne is there .
Parsing [sent. 1092 len. 7]: To dead men 's undelightsome stay ?
Parsing [sent. 1093 len. 17]: There is thy walk , and there to lie Unknown , in vain I should assay .
Parsing [sent. 1094 len. 10]: O sun , whom light nor flight can match !
Parsing [sent. 1095 len. 40]: Suppose thy lightful flightful wings Thou lend to me , And I could flee As far as thee the evening brings : Ev 'n led to west he would me catch , Nor should I lurk with western things .
Parsing [sent. 1096 len. 49]: Do thou thy best , O secret night , In sable veil to cover me : Thy sable veil Shall vainly fail : With day unmasked my night shall be ; For night is day , and darkness light , O father of all lights , to thee .
Parsing [sent. 1097 len. 20]: Note the most musical play with the words _ light _ and _ flight _ in the fifth stanza .
Parsing [sent. 1098 len. 10]: There is hardly a line that is not delightful .
Parsing [sent. 1099 len. 8]: They were a wonderful family those Sidneys .
Parsing [sent. 1100 len. 30]: Mary , for whom Philip wrote his chief work , thence called `` The Countess of Pembroke 's _ Arcadia , _ '' was a woman of rare gifts .
Parsing [sent. 1101 len. 16]: The chief poem known to be hers is called _ Our Saviour 's Passion _ .
Parsing [sent. 1102 len. 10]: It is full of the faults of the age .
Parsing [sent. 1103 len. 44]: Sir Philip 's sport with words is so graceful and ordered as to subserve the utterance of the thought : his sister 's fanciful convolutions appear to be there for their own sake -- certainly are there to the obscuration of the sense .
Parsing [sent. 1104 len. 46]: The difficulty of the poem arises in part , I believe , from corruption , but chiefly from a certain fantastic way of dealing with thought as well as word of which I shall have occasion to say more when we descend a little further .
Parsing [sent. 1105 len. 47]: It is , in the main , a lamentation over our Saviour 's sufferings , in which the countess is largely guilty of the very feminine fault of seeking to convey the intensity of her emotions by forcing words , accumulating forms , and exaggerating descriptions .
Parsing [sent. 1106 len. 19]: This may indeed convince as to the presence of feeling , but can not communicate the feeling itself .
Parsing [sent. 1107 len. 28]: _ The _ right word will at once generate a sympathy of which all agonies of utterance will only render the willing mind more and more incapable .
Parsing [sent. 1108 len. 36]: The poem is likewise very diffuse -- again a common fault with women of power ; for indeed the faculty of compressing thought into crystalline form is one of the rarest gifts of artistic genius .
Parsing [sent. 1109 len. 19]: It consists of a hundred and ten stanzas , from which I shall gather and arrange a few .
Parsing [sent. 1110 len. 62]: He placed all rest , and had no resting place ; He healed each pain , yet lived in sore distress ; Deserved all good , yet lived in great disgrace ; Gave all hearts joy , himself in heaviness ; Suffered them live , by whom himself was slain : Lord , who can live to see such love again ?
Parsing [sent. 1111 len. 62]: Whose mansion heaven , yet lay within a manger ; Who gave all food , yet sucked a virgin 's breast ; Who could have killed , yet fled a threatening danger ; Who sought all quiet by his own unrest ; Who died for them that highly did offend him , And lives for them that can not comprehend him .
Parsing [sent. 1112 len. 60]: Who came no further than his Father sent him , And did fulfil but what he did command him ; Who prayed for them that proudly did torment him For telling truly of what they did demand him ; Who did all good that humbly did intreat him , And bare their blows , that did unkindly beat him .
Parsing [sent. 1113 len. 61]: Had I but seen him as his servants did , At sea , at land , in city , or in field , Though in himself he had his glory hid , That in his grace the light of glory held , Then might my sorrow somewhat be appeaséd , That once my soul had in his sight been pleaséd .
Parsing [sent. 1114 len. 2]: No !
Parsing [sent. 1115 len. 34]: I have run the way of wickedness , Forgetting what my faith should follow most ; I did not think upon thy holiness , Nor by my sins what sweetness I have lost .
Parsing [sent. 1116 len. 3]: Oh sin !
Parsing [sent. 1117 len. 20]: for sin hath compassed me about , That , Lord , I know not where to find thee out .
Parsing [sent. 1118 len. 108]: Where he that sits on the supernal throne , In majesty most glorious to behold , And holds the sceptre of the world alone , Hath not his garments of imbroidered gold , But he is clothed with truth and righteousness , Where angels all do sing with joyfulness , Where heavenly love is cause of holy life , And holy life increaseth heavenly love ; Where peace established without fear or strife , Doth prove the blessing of the soul 's behove ; -LSB- 67 -RSB- Where thirst nor hunger , grief nor sorrow dwelleth , But peace in joy , and joy in peace excelleth .
Parsing [sent. 1119 len. 20]: Had all the poem been like these stanzas , I should not have spoken so strongly concerning its faults .
Parsing [sent. 1120 len. 9]: There are a few more such in it .
Parsing [sent. 1121 len. 105]: It closes with a very fantastic use of musical terms , following upon a curious category of the works of nature as praising God , to which I refer for the sake of one stanza , or rather of one line in the stanza : To see the greyhound course , the hound in chase , _ Whilst little dormouse sleepeth out her eyne ; _ The lambs and rabbits sweetly run at base , -LSB- 68 -RSB- Whilst highest trees the little squirrels climb , The crawling worms out creeping in the showers , And how the snails do climb the lofty towers .
Parsing [sent. 1122 len. 13]: What a love of animated nature there is in the lovely lady !
Parsing [sent. 1123 len. 20]: I am all but confident , however , that second line came to her from watching her children asleep .
Parsing [sent. 1124 len. 61]: She had one child at least : that William Herbert , who is generally , and with weight , believed the W.H. of Shakspere 's Sonnets , a grander honour than the earldom of Pembroke , or even the having Philip Sidney to his uncle : I will not say grander than having Mary Sidney to his _ mother _ .
Parsing [sent. 1125 len. 54]: Let me now turn to Sidney 's friend , Sir Fulk Grevill , Lord Brooke , who afterwards wrote his life , `` as an intended preface '' to all his `` Monuments to the memory of Sir Philip Sidney , '' the said _ monuments _ being Lord Brooke 's own poems .
Parsing [sent. 1126 len. 44]: My extract is from _ A Treatise of Religion _ , in which , if the reader do not find much of poetic form , he will find at least some grand spiritual philosophy , the stuff whereof all highest poetry is fashioned .
Parsing [sent. 1127 len. 27]: It is one of the first poems in which the philosophy of religion , and not either its doctrine , feeling , or history , predominates .
Parsing [sent. 1128 len. 17]: It is , as a whole , poor , chiefly from its being so loosely written .
Parsing [sent. 1129 len. 47]: There are men , and men whose thoughts are of great worth , to whom it never seems to occur that they may utter very largely and convey very little ; that what is clear to themselves is in their speech obscure as a late twilight .
Parsing [sent. 1130 len. 39]: Their utterance is rarely articulate : their spiritual mouth talks with but half-movements of its lips ; it does not model their thoughts into clear-cut shapes , such as the spiritual ear can distinguish as they enter it .
Parsing [sent. 1131 len. 6]: Of such is Lord Brooke .
Parsing [sent. 1132 len. 33]: These few stanzas , however , my readers will be glad to have : What is the chain which draws us back again , And lifts man up unto his first creation ?
Parsing [sent. 1133 len. 34]: Nothing in him his own heart can restrain ; His reason lives a captive to temptation ; Example is corrupt ; precepts are mixed ; All fleshly knowledge frail , and never fixed .
Parsing [sent. 1134 len. 59]: It is a light , a gift , a grace inspired ; A spark of power , a goodness of the Good ; Desire in him , that never is desired ; An unity , where desolation stood ; In us , not of us , a Spirit not of earth , Fashioning the mortal to immortal birth .
Parsing [sent. 1135 len. 56]: * * * * * Sense of this God , by fear , the sensual have , Distresséd Nature crying unto Grace ; For sovereign reason then becomes a slave , And yields to servile sense her sovereign place , When more or other she affects to be Than seat or shrine of this Eternity .
Parsing [sent. 1136 len. 60]: Yea , Prince of Earth let Man assume to be , Nay more -- of Man let Man himself be God , Yet without God , a slave of slaves is he ; To others , wonder ; to himself , a rod ; Restless despair , desire , and desolation ; The more secure , the more abomination .
Parsing [sent. 1137 len. 11]: Then by affecting power , we can not know him .
Parsing [sent. 1138 len. 11]: By knowing all things else , we know him less .
Parsing [sent. 1139 len. 5]: Nature contains him not .
Parsing [sent. 1140 len. 6]: Art can not show him .
Parsing [sent. 1141 len. 9]: Opinions idols , and not God , express .
Parsing [sent. 1142 len. 22]: Without , in power , we see him everywhere ; Within , we rest not , till we find him there .
Parsing [sent. 1143 len. 19]: Then seek we must ; that course is natural -- For ownéd souls to find their owner out .
Parsing [sent. 1144 len. 35]: Our free remorses when our natures fall -- When we do well , our hearts made free from doubt -- Prove service due to one Omnipotence , And Nature of religion to have sense .
Parsing [sent. 1145 len. 54]: Questions again , which in our hearts arise -- Since loving knowledge , not humility -- Though they be curious , godless , and unwise , Yet prove our nature feels a Deity ; For if these strifes rose out of other grounds , Man were to God as deafness is to sounds .
Parsing [sent. 1146 len. 59]: * * * * * Yet in this strife , this natural remorse , If we could bend the force of power and wit To work upon the heart , and make divorce There from the evil which preventeth it , In judgment of the truth we should not doubt Good life would find a good religion out .
Parsing [sent. 1147 len. 30]: If a fair proportion of it were equal to this , the poem would be a fine one , not for its poetry , but for its spiritual metaphysics .
Parsing [sent. 1148 len. 22]: I think the fourth and fifth of the stanzas I have given , profound in truth , and excellent in utterance .
Parsing [sent. 1149 len. 5]: They are worth pondering .
Parsing [sent. 1150 len. 23]: We now descend a decade of the century , to find another group of names within the immediate threshold of the sixties .
Parsing [sent. 1151 len. 3]: CHAPTER VI .
Parsing [sent. 1152 len. 6]: LORD BACON AND HIS COEVALS .
Parsing [sent. 1153 len. 21]: Except it be Milton 's , there is not any prose fuller of grand poetic embodiments than Lord Bacon 's .
Parsing [sent. 1154 len. 47]: Yet he always writes contemptuously of poetry , having in his eye no doubt the commonplace kinds of it , which will always occupy more bulk , and hence be more obtrusive , than that which is true in its nature and rare in its workmanship .
Parsing [sent. 1155 len. 35]: Towards the latter end of his life , however , being in ill health at the time , he translated seven of the Psalms of David into verse , dedicating them to George Herbert .
Parsing [sent. 1156 len. 8]: The best of them is Psalm civ .
Parsing [sent. 1157 len. 27]: -- just the one upon which we might suppose , from his love to the laws of Nature , he would dwell with the greatest sympathy .
Parsing [sent. 1158 len. 38]: Partly from the wish to hear his voice amongst the rest of our singers , partly for the merits of the version itself , which has some remarkable lines , I have resolved to include it here .
Parsing [sent. 1159 len. 13]: It is the first specimen I have given in the heroic couplet .
Parsing [sent. 1160 len. 40]: Father and King of Powers both high and low , Whose sounding fame all creatures serve to blow ; My soul shall with the rest strike up thy praise , And carol of thy works , and wondrous ways .
Parsing [sent. 1161 len. 11]: But who can blaze thy beauties , Lord , aright ?
Parsing [sent. 1162 len. 9]: They turn the brittle beams of mortal sight .
Parsing [sent. 1163 len. 37]: Upon thy head thou wear ` st a glorious crown , All set with virtues , polished with renown : Thence round about a silver veil doth fall Of crystal light , mother of colours all .
Parsing [sent. 1164 len. 91]: The compass , heaven , smooth without grain or fold , All set with spangs of glittering stars untold , And striped with golden beams of power unpent , Is raiséd up for a removing tent Vaulted and archéd are his chamber beams Upon the seas , the waters , and the streams ; The clouds as chariots swift do scour the sky ; The stormy winds upon their wings do fly His angels spirits are , that wait his will ; As flames of fire his anger they fulfil .
Parsing [sent. 1165 len. 37]: In the beginning , with a mighty hand , He made the earth by counterpoise to stand , Never to move , but to be fixed still ; Yet hath no pillars but his sacred will .
Parsing [sent. 1166 len. 92]: This earth , as with a veil , once covered was ; The waters overflowéd all the mass ; But upon his rebuke away they fled , And then the hills began to show their head ; The vales their hollow bosoms opened plain , The streams ran trembling down the vales again ; And that the earth no more might drowned be , He set the sea his bounds of liberty ; And though his waves resound and beat the shore , Yet it is bridled by his holy lore .
Parsing [sent. 1167 len. 75]: Then did the rivers seek their proper places , And found their heads , their issues , and their races ; The springs do feed the rivers all the way , And so the tribute to the sea repay : Running along through many a pleasant field , Much fruitfulness unto the earth they yield ; That know the beasts and cattle feeding by , Which for to slake their thirst do thither hie .
Parsing [sent. 1168 len. 37]: Nay , desert grounds the streams do not forsake , But through the unknown ways their journey take ; The asses wild that hide in wilderness , Do thither come , their thirst for to refresh .
Parsing [sent. 1169 len. 38]: The shady trees along their banks do spring , In which the birds do build , and sit , and sing , Stroking the gentle air with pleasant notes , Plaining or chirping through their warbling throats .
Parsing [sent. 1170 len. 73]: The higher grounds , where waters can not rise , By rain and dews are watered from the skies , Causing the earth put forth the grass for beasts , And garden-herbs , served at the greatest feasts , And bread that is all viands ' firmament , And gives a firm and solid nourishment ; And wine man 's spirits for to recreate , And oil his face for to exhilarate .
Parsing [sent. 1171 len. 55]: The sappy cedars , tall like stately towers , High flying birds do harbour in their bowers ; The holy storks that are the travellers , Choose for to dwell and build within the firs ; The climbing goats hang on steep mountains ' side ; The digging conies in the rocks do bide .
Parsing [sent. 1172 len. 40]: The moon , so constant in inconstancy , Doth rule the monthly seasons orderly ; The sun , eye of the world , doth know his race , And when to show , and when to hide his face .
Parsing [sent. 1173 len. 40]: Thou makest darkness , that it may be night , Whenas the savage beasts that fly the light , As conscious of man 's hatred , leave their den , And range abroad , secured from sight of men .
Parsing [sent. 1174 len. 59]: Then do the forests ring of lions roaring , That ask their meat of God , their strength restoring ; But when the day appears , they back do fly , And in their dens again do lurking lie ; Then man goes forth to labour in the field , Whereby his grounds more rich increase may yield .
Parsing [sent. 1175 len. 32]: O Lord , thy providence sufficeth all ; Thy goodness not restrained but general Over thy creatures , the whole earth doth flow With thy great largeness poured forth here below .
Parsing [sent. 1176 len. 19]: Nor is it earth alone exalts thy name , But seas and streams likewise do spread the same .
Parsing [sent. 1177 len. 113]: The rolling seas unto the lot do fall Of beasts innumerable , great and small ; There do the stately ships plough up the floods ; The greater navies look like walking woods ; The fishes there far voyages do make , To divers shores their journey they do take ; There hast thou set the great leviathan , That makes the seas to seethe like boiling pan : All these do ask of thee their meat to live , Which in due season thou to them dost give : Ope thou thy hand , and then they have good fare ; Shut thou thy hand , and then they troubled are .
Parsing [sent. 1178 len. 74]: All life and spirit from thy breath proceed , Thy word doth all things generate and feed : If thou withdraw ` st it , then they cease to be , And straight return to dust and vanity ; But when thy breath thou dost send forth again , Then all things do renew , and spring amain , So that the earth but lately desolate Doth now return unto the former state .
Parsing [sent. 1179 len. 38]: The glorious majesty of God above Shall ever reign , in mercy and in love ; God shall rejoice all his fair works to see , For , as they come from him , all perfect be .
Parsing [sent. 1180 len. 22]: The earth shall quake , if aught his wrath provoke ; Let him but touch the mountains , they shall smoke .
Parsing [sent. 1181 len. 42]: As long as life doth last , I hymns will sing , With cheerful voice , to the Eternal King ; As long as I have being , I will praise The works of God , and all his wondrous ways .
Parsing [sent. 1182 len. 17]: I know that he my words will not despise : Thanksgiving is to him a sacrifice .
Parsing [sent. 1183 len. 20]: But as for sinners , they shall be destroyed From off the earth -- their places shall be void .
Parsing [sent. 1184 len. 10]: Let all his works praise him with one accord !
Parsing [sent. 1185 len. 8]: Oh praise the Lord , my soul !
Parsing [sent. 1186 len. 5]: Praise ye the Lord !
Parsing [sent. 1187 len. 65]: His Hundred and Forty-ninth Psalm is likewise good ; but I have given enough of Lord Bacon 's verse , and proceed to call up one who was a poet indeed , although little known as such , being a Roman Catholic , a Jesuit even , and therefore , in Elizabeth 's reign , a traitor , and subject to the penalties according .
Parsing [sent. 1188 len. 60]: Robert Southwell , `` thirteen times most cruelly tortured , '' could `` not be induced to confess anything , not even the colour of the horse whereon on a certain day he rode , lest from such indication his adversaries might conjecture in what house , or in company of what Catholics , he that day was . ''
Parsing [sent. 1189 len. 28]: I quote these words of Lord Burleigh , lest any of my readers , discovering weakness in his verse , should attribute weakness to the man himself .
Parsing [sent. 1190 len. 21]: It was no doubt on political grounds that these tortures , and the death that followed them , were inflicted .
Parsing [sent. 1191 len. 27]: But it was for the truth _ as he saw it _ , that is , for the sake of duty , that Southwell thus endured .
Parsing [sent. 1192 len. 18]: We must not impute all the evils of a system to every individual who holds by it .
Parsing [sent. 1193 len. 35]: It may be found that a man has , for the sole sake of self-abnegation , yielded homage , where , if his object had been personal aggrandizement , he might have wielded authority .
Parsing [sent. 1194 len. 27]: Southwell , if that which comes from within a man may be taken as the test of his character , was a devout and humble Christian .
Parsing [sent. 1195 len. 19]: In the choir of our singers we only ask : `` Dost thou lift up thine heart ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1196 len. 17]: Southwell 's song answers for him : `` I lift it up unto the Lord . ''
Parsing [sent. 1197 len. 12]: His chief poem is called _ St. Peter 's Complaint _ .
Parsing [sent. 1198 len. 12]: It is of considerable length -- a hundred and thirty-two stanzas .
Parsing [sent. 1199 len. 22]: It reminds us of the Countess of Pembroke 's poem , but is far more articulate and far superior in versification .
Parsing [sent. 1200 len. 34]: Perhaps its chief fault is that the pauses are so measured with the lines as to make every line almost a sentence , the effect of which is a considerable degree of monotony .
Parsing [sent. 1201 len. 58]: Like all writers of the time , he is , of course , fond of antithesis , and abounds in conceits and fancies ; whence he attributes a multitude of expressions to St. Peter of which never possibly could the substantial ideas have entered the Apostle 's mind , or probably any other than Southwell 's own .
Parsing [sent. 1202 len. 25]: There is also a good deal of sentimentalism in the poem , a fault from which I fear modern Catholic verse is rarely free .
Parsing [sent. 1203 len. 48]: Probably the Italian poetry with which he must have been familiar in his youth , during his residence in Rome , accustomed him to such irreverences of expression as this sentimentalism gives occasion to , and which are very far from indicating a correspondent state of feeling .
Parsing [sent. 1204 len. 15]: Sentiment is a poor ape of love ; but the love is true notwithstanding .
Parsing [sent. 1205 len. 32]: Here are a few stanzas from _ St. Peter 's Complaint _ : Titles I make untruths : am I a rock , That with so soft a gale was overthrown ?
Parsing [sent. 1206 len. 18]: Am I fit pastor for the faithful flock To guide their souls that murdered thus mine own ?
Parsing [sent. 1207 len. 23]: A rock of ruin , not a rest to stay ; A pastor , -- not to feed , but to betray .
Parsing [sent. 1208 len. 36]: Parting from Christ my fainting force declined ; With lingering foot I followed him aloof ; Base fear out of my heart his love unshrined , Huge in high words , but impotent in proof .
Parsing [sent. 1209 len. 46]: My vaunts did seem hatched under Samson 's locks , Yet woman 's words did give me murdering knocks * * * * * At Sorrow 's door I knocked : they craved my name I answered , `` One unworthy to be known . ''
Parsing [sent. 1210 len. 5]: `` What one ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1211 len. 3]: say they .
Parsing [sent. 1212 len. 7]: `` One worthiest of blame . ''
Parsing [sent. 1213 len. 5]: `` But who ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1214 len. 13]: `` A wretch not God 's , nor yet his own . ''
Parsing [sent. 1215 len. 5]: `` A man ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1216 len. 6]: `` Oh , no ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1217 len. 5]: `` A beast ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1218 len. 5]: `` Much worse . ''
Parsing [sent. 1219 len. 5]: `` What creature ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1220 len. 5]: `` A rock . ''
Parsing [sent. 1221 len. 5]: `` How called ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1222 len. 9]: `` The rock of scandal , Peter . ''
Parsing [sent. 1223 len. 7]: * * * * * Christ !
Parsing [sent. 1224 len. 39]: health of fevered soul , heaven of the mind , Force of the feeble , nurse of infant loves , Guide to the wandering foot , light to the blind , Whom weeping wins , repentant sorrow moves !
Parsing [sent. 1225 len. 19]: Father in care , mother in tender heart , Revive and save me , slain with sinful dart !
Parsing [sent. 1226 len. 37]: If King Manasseh , sunk in depth of sin , With plaints and tears recovered grace and crown , A worthless worm some mild regard may win , And lowly creep where flying threw it down .
Parsing [sent. 1227 len. 23]: A poor desire I have to mend my ill ; I should , I would , I dare not say I will .
Parsing [sent. 1228 len. 23]: I dare not say I will , but wish I may ; My pride is checked : high words the speaker spilt .
Parsing [sent. 1229 len. 27]: My good , O Lord , thy gift -- thy strength , my stay -- Give what thou bidst , and then bid what thou wilt .
Parsing [sent. 1230 len. 21]: Work with me what of me thou dost request ; Then will I dare the worst and love the best .
Parsing [sent. 1231 len. 44]: Here , from another poem , are two little stanzas worth preserving : Yet God 's must I remain , By death , by wrong , by shame ; I can not blot out of my heart That grace wrought in his name .
Parsing [sent. 1232 len. 27]: I can not set at nought , Whom I have held so dear ; I can not make Him seem afar That is indeed so near .
Parsing [sent. 1233 len. 22]: The following poem , in style almost as simple as a ballad , is at once of the quaintest and truest .
Parsing [sent. 1234 len. 22]: Common minds , which must always associate a certain conventional respectability with the forms of religion , will think it irreverent .
Parsing [sent. 1235 len. 25]: I judge its reverence profound , and such none the less that it is pervaded by a sweet and delicate tone of holy humour .
Parsing [sent. 1236 len. 19]: The very title has a glimmer of the glowing heart of Christianity : NEW PRINCE , NEW POMP .
Parsing [sent. 1237 len. 23]: Behold a silly , -LSB- 69 -RSB- tender babe , In freezing winter night , In homely manger trembling lies ; Alas !
Parsing [sent. 1238 len. 4]: a piteous sight .
Parsing [sent. 1239 len. 28]: The inns are full ; no man will yield This little pilgrim bed ; But forced he is with silly beasts In crib to shroud his head .
Parsing [sent. 1240 len. 25]: Despise him not for lying there ; First what he is inquire : An orient pearl is often found In depth of dirty mire .
Parsing [sent. 1241 len. 30]: Weigh not his crib , his wooden dish , Nor beasts that by him feed ; Weigh not his mother 's poor attire , Nor Joseph 's simple weed .
Parsing [sent. 1242 len. 29]: This stable is a prince 's court , The crib his chair of state ; The beasts are parcel of his pomp , The wooden dish his plate .
Parsing [sent. 1243 len. 25]: The persons in that poor attire His royal liveries wear ; The Prince himself is come from heaven : This pomp is praised there .
Parsing [sent. 1244 len. 28]: With joy approach , O Christian wight ; Do homage to thy King ; And highly praise this humble pomp , Which he from heaven doth bring .
Parsing [sent. 1245 len. 17]: Another , on the same subject , he calls _ New Heaven , New War _ .
Parsing [sent. 1246 len. 7]: It is fantastic to a degree .
Parsing [sent. 1247 len. 58]: One stanza , however , I like much : This little babe , so few days old , Is come to rifle Satan 's fold ; All hell doth at his presence quake , Though he himself for cold do shake ; For in this weak , unarmed wise , The gates of hell he will surprise .
Parsing [sent. 1248 len. 10]: There is profoundest truth in the symbolism of this .
Parsing [sent. 1249 len. 26]: Here is the latter half of a poem called _ St. Peters Remorse _ : Did mercy spin the thread To weave injustice ' loom ?
Parsing [sent. 1250 len. 12]: Wert then a father to conclude With dreadful judge 's doom ?
Parsing [sent. 1251 len. 25]: It is a small relief To say I was thy child , If , as an ill-deserving foe , From grace I am exiled .
Parsing [sent. 1252 len. 28]: I was , I had , I could -- All words importing want ; They are but dust of dead supplies , Where needful helps are scant .
Parsing [sent. 1253 len. 25]: Once to have been in bliss That hardly can return , Doth but bewray from whence I fell , And wherefore now I mourn .
Parsing [sent. 1254 len. 22]: All thoughts of passed hopes Increase my present cross ; Like ruins of decayed joys , They still upbraid my loss .
Parsing [sent. 1255 len. 6]: O mild and mighty Lord !
Parsing [sent. 1256 len. 21]: Amend that is amiss ; My sin my sore , thy love my salve , Thy cure my comfort is .
Parsing [sent. 1257 len. 28]: Confirm thy former deed ; Reform that is defiled ; I was , I am , I will remain Thy charge , thy choice , thy child .
Parsing [sent. 1258 len. 14]: Here are some neat stanzas from a poem he calls CONTENT AND RICH .
Parsing [sent. 1259 len. 25]: My conscience is my crown , Contented thoughts my rest ; My heart is happy in itself , My bliss is in my breast .
Parsing [sent. 1260 len. 24]: My wishes are but few , All easy to fulfil ; I make the limits of my power The bounds unto my will .
Parsing [sent. 1261 len. 25]: Sith sails of largest size The storm doth soonest tear , I bear so small and low a sail As freeth me from fear .
Parsing [sent. 1262 len. 24]: And taught with often proof , A tempered calm I find To be most solace to itself , Best cure for angry mind .
Parsing [sent. 1263 len. 25]: No chance of Fortune 's calms Can cast my comforts down ; When Fortune smiles I smile to think How quickly she will frown .
Parsing [sent. 1264 len. 27]: And when in froward mood She proves an angry foe : Small gain I found to let her come , Less loss to let her go .
Parsing [sent. 1265 len. 45]: There is just one stanza in a poem of Daniel , who belongs by birth to this group , which I should like to print by itself , if it were only for the love Coleridge had to the last two lines of it .
Parsing [sent. 1266 len. 15]: It needs little stretch of scheme to let it show itself amongst religious poems .
Parsing [sent. 1267 len. 12]: It occurs in a fine epistle to the Countess of Cumberland .
Parsing [sent. 1268 len. 28]: Daniel 's writing is full of the practical wisdom of the inner life , and the stanza which I quote has a certain Wordsworthian flavour about it .
Parsing [sent. 1269 len. 81]: It will not make a complete sentence , but must yet stand by itself : Knowing the heart of man is set to be The centre of this world , about the which These revolutions of disturbances Still roll ; where all th ' aspects of misery Predominate ; whose strong effects are such As he must bear , being powerless to redress ; And that unless above himself he can Erect himself , how poor a thing is man !
Parsing [sent. 1270 len. 10]: Later in the decade , comes Sir Henry Wotton .
Parsing [sent. 1271 len. 33]: It will be seen that I have arranged my singers with reference to their birth , not to the point of time at which this or that poem was written or published .
Parsing [sent. 1272 len. 41]: The poetic influences which work on the shaping fantasy are chiefly felt in youth , and hence the predominant mode of a poet 's utterance will be determined by what and where and amongst whom he was during that season .
Parsing [sent. 1273 len. 33]: The kinds of the various poems will therefore probably fall into natural sequence rather after the dates of the youth of the writers than after the years in which they were written .
Parsing [sent. 1274 len. 30]: Wotton was better known in his day as a politician than as a poet , and chiefly in ours as the subject of one of Izaak Walton 's biographies .
Parsing [sent. 1275 len. 15]: Something of artistic instinct , rather than finish , is evident in his verses .
Parsing [sent. 1276 len. 22]: Here is the best and the best-known of the few poems recognized as his : THE CHARACTER OF A HAPPY LIFE .
Parsing [sent. 1277 len. 107]: How happy is he born and taught , That serveth not another 's will ; Whose armour is his honest thought , And silly truth his highest skill ; Whose passions not his masters are ; Whose soul is still prepared for death , Untiéd to the world with care Of prince 's grace or vulgar breath ; Who hath his life from humours freed ; Whose conscience is his strong retreat ; Whose state can neither flatterers feed , Nor ruin make accusers great ; Who envieth none whom chance doth raise Or vice ; who never understood How swords give slighter wounds than praise .
Parsing [sent. 1278 len. 38]: Nor rules of state , but rules of good ; Who God doth late and early pray More of his grace than gifts to lend ; And entertains the harmless day With a well-chosen book or friend .
Parsing [sent. 1279 len. 33]: This man is free from servile bands Of hope to rise , or fear to fall : Lord of himself , though not of lands And having nothing , yet hath all .
Parsing [sent. 1280 len. 26]: Some of my readers will observe that in many places I have given a reading different from that in the best-known copy of the poem .
Parsing [sent. 1281 len. 12]: I have followed a manuscript in the handwriting of Ben Jonson .
Parsing [sent. 1282 len. 32]: -LSB- 70 -RSB- I can not tell whether Jonson has put the master 's hand to the amateur 's work , but in every case I find his reading the best .
Parsing [sent. 1283 len. 15]: Sir John Davies must have been about fifteen years younger than Sir Fulk Grevill .
Parsing [sent. 1284 len. 76]: He was born in 1570 , was bred a barrister , and rose to high position through the favour of James I. -- gained , it is said , by the poem which the author called _ Nosce Teipsum _ , -LSB- 71 -RSB- but which is generally entitled _ On the Immortality of the Soul _ , intending by _ immortality _ the spiritual nature of the soul , resulting in continuity of existence .
Parsing [sent. 1285 len. 25]: It is a wonderful instance of what can be done for metaphysics in verse , and by means of imagination or poetic embodiment generally .
Parsing [sent. 1286 len. 54]: Argumentation can not of course naturally belong to the region of poetry , however well it may comport itself when there naturalized ; and consequently , although there are most poetic no less than profound passages in the treatise , a light scruple arises whether its constituent matter can properly be called poetry .
Parsing [sent. 1287 len. 33]: At all events , however , certain of the more prosaic measures and stanzas lend themselves readily , and with much favour , to some of the more complex of logical necessities .
Parsing [sent. 1288 len. 42]: And it must be remembered that in human speech , as in the human mind , there are no absolute divisions : power shades off into feeling ; and the driest logic may find the heroic couplet render it good service .
Parsing [sent. 1289 len. 35]: Sir John Davies 's treatise is not only far more poetic in image and utterance than that of Lord Brooke , but is far more clear in argument and firm in expression as well .
Parsing [sent. 1290 len. 20]: Here is a fine invocation : O Light , which mak ` st the light which makes the day !
Parsing [sent. 1291 len. 30]: Which sett ` st the eye without , and mind within ; Lighten my spirit with one clear heavenly ray , Which now to view itself doth first begin .
Parsing [sent. 1292 len. 52]: * * * * * Thou , like the sun , dost , with an equal ray , Into the palace and the cottage shine ; And show ` st the soul both to the clerk and lay , _ learned and By the clear lamp of th ' oracle divine .
Parsing [sent. 1293 len. 51]: -LSB- unlearned _ He is puzzled enough to get the theology of his time into harmony with his philosophy , and I can not say that he is always triumphant in the attempt ; but here at least is good argument in justification of the freedom of man to sin .
Parsing [sent. 1294 len. 43]: If by His word he had the current stayed Of Adam 's will , which was by nature free , It had been one as if his word had said , `` I will henceforth that Man no Man shall be . ''
Parsing [sent. 1295 len. 24]: * * * * * For what is Man without a moving mind , Which hath a judging wit , and choosing will ?
Parsing [sent. 1296 len. 24]: Now , if God 's pow ' r should her election bind , Her motions then would cease , and stand all still .
Parsing [sent. 1297 len. 44]: * * * * * So that if Man would be unvariable , He must be God , or like a rock or tree ; For ev 'n the perfect angels were not stable , But had a fall more desperate than we .
Parsing [sent. 1298 len. 27]: The poem contains much excellent argument in mental science as well as in religion and metaphysics ; but with that department I have nothing to do .
Parsing [sent. 1299 len. 32]: I shall now give an outlook from the highest peak of the poem -- to any who are willing to take the trouble necessary for seeing what another would show them .
Parsing [sent. 1300 len. 23]: The section from which I have gathered the following stanzas is devoted to the more immediate proof of the soul 's immortality .
Parsing [sent. 1301 len. 37]: Her only end is never-ending bliss , Which is the eternal face of God to see , Who last of ends and first of causes is ; And to do this , she must eternal be .
Parsing [sent. 1302 len. 34]: Again , how can she but immortal be , When with the motions of both will and wit , She still aspireth to eternity , And never rests till she attains to it ?
Parsing [sent. 1303 len. 35]: Water in conduit-pipes can rise no higher Than the well-head from whence it first doth spring ; Then since to eternal God she doth aspire , She can not but be an eternal thing .
Parsing [sent. 1304 len. 37]: At first her mother-earth she holdeth dear , And doth embrace the world and worldly things ; She flies close by the ground , and hovers here , And mounts not up with her celestial wings .
Parsing [sent. 1305 len. 37]: Yet under heaven she can not light on ought That with her heavenly nature doth agree She can not rest , she can not fix her thought , She can not in this world contented be .
Parsing [sent. 1306 len. 20]: For who did ever yet , in honour , wealth , Or pleasure of the sense , contentment find ?
Parsing [sent. 1307 len. 110]: Whoever ceased to wish , when he had health Or having wisdom , was not vexed in mind Then as a bee , which among weeds doth fall , Which seem sweet flowers , with lustre fresh and gay -- She lights on that , and this , and tasteth all , But , pleased with none , doth rise , and soar away ; So , when the soul finds here no true content , And , like Noah 's dove , can no sure footing take , She doth return from whence she first was sent , And flies to him that first her wings did make .
Parsing [sent. 1308 len. 40]: Wit , seeking truth , from cause to cause ascends , And never rests till it the first attain ; Will , seeking good , finds many middle ends , But never stays till it the last do gain .
Parsing [sent. 1309 len. 39]: Now God the truth , and first of causes is ; God is the last good end , which lasteth still ; Being Alpha and Omega named for this : Alpha to wit , Omega to the will .
Parsing [sent. 1310 len. 38]: Since then her heavenly kind she doth display In that to God she doth directly move , And on no mortal thing can make her stay , She can not be from hence , but from above .
Parsing [sent. 1311 len. 19]: One passage more , the conclusion and practical summing up of the whole : O ignorant poor man !
Parsing [sent. 1312 len. 14]: what dost thou bear , Locked up within the casket of thy breast ?
Parsing [sent. 1313 len. 9]: What jewels and what riches hast thou there !
Parsing [sent. 1314 len. 9]: What heavenly treasure in so weak a chest !
Parsing [sent. 1315 len. 36]: Think of her worth , and think that God did mean This worthy mind should worthy things embrace : Blot not her beauties with thy thoughts unclean , Nor her dishonour with thy passion base .
Parsing [sent. 1316 len. 32]: Kill not her quickening power with surfeitings ; Mar not her sense with sensuality ; Cast not her serious wit on idle things ; Make not her free-will slave to vanity .
Parsing [sent. 1317 len. 47]: And when thou think ` st of her eternity , Think not that death against our nature is ; Think it a birth ; and when thou go ` st to die , Sing like a swan , as if thou went ` st to bliss .
Parsing [sent. 1318 len. 44]: And if thou , like a child , didst fear before , Being in the dark where thou didst nothing see ; Now I have brought thee torch-light , fear no more ; Now when thou diest thou canst not hood-wink 'd be .
Parsing [sent. 1319 len. 42]: And thou , my soul , which turn ` st with curious eye To view the beams of thine own form divine , Know , that thou canst know nothing perfectly , While thou art clouded with this flesh of mine .
Parsing [sent. 1320 len. 35]: Take heed of over-weening , and compare Thy peacock 's feet with thy gay peacock 's train : Study the best and highest things that are , But of thyself an humble thought retain .
Parsing [sent. 1321 len. 40]: Cast down thyself , and only strive to raise The story of thy Maker 's sacred name : Use all thy powers that blessed Power to praise , Which gives the power to be , and use the same .
Parsing [sent. 1322 len. 31]: In looking back over our path from the point we have now reached , the first thought that suggests itself is -- How much the reflective has supplanted the emotional !
Parsing [sent. 1323 len. 70]: I do not mean for a moment that the earliest poems were without thought , or that the latest are without emotion ; but in the former there is more of the skin , as it were -- in the latter , more of the bones of worship ; not that in the one the worship is but skin-deep , or that in the other the bones are dry .
Parsing [sent. 1324 len. 38]: To look at the change a little more closely : we find in the earliest time , feeling working on historic fact and on what was received as such , and the result simple aspiration after goodness .
Parsing [sent. 1325 len. 42]: The next stage is good _ doctrine _ -- I use the word , as St. Paul uses it , for instruction in righteousness -- chiefly by means of allegory , all attempts at analysis being made through personification of qualities .
Parsing [sent. 1326 len. 12]: Here the general form is frequently more poetic than the matter .
Parsing [sent. 1327 len. 16]: After this we have a period principally of imitation , sometimes good , sometimes indifferent .
Parsing [sent. 1328 len. 29]: Next , with the Reformation and the revival of literature together , come more of art and more of philosophy , to the detriment of the lyrical expression .
Parsing [sent. 1329 len. 14]: People can not think and sing : they can only feel and sing .
Parsing [sent. 1330 len. 30]: But the philosophy goes farther in this direction , even to the putting in abeyance of that from which song takes its rise , -- namely , feeling itself .
Parsing [sent. 1331 len. 45]: As to the former , amongst the verse of the period I have given , there is hardly anything to be called song but Sir Philip Sidney 's Psalms , and for them we are more indebted to King David than to Sir Philip .
Parsing [sent. 1332 len. 59]: As to the latter , even in the case of that most mournful poem of the Countess of Pembroke , it is , to quite an unhealthy degree , occupied with the attempt to work upon her own feelings by the contemplation of them , instead of with the utterance of those aroused by the contemplation of truth .
Parsing [sent. 1333 len. 15]: In her case the metaphysics have begun to prey upon and consume the emotions .
Parsing [sent. 1334 len. 50]: Besides , that age was essentially a dramatic age , as even its command of language , especially as shown in the pranks it plays with it , would almost indicate ; and the dramatic impulse is less favourable , though not at all opposed , to lyrical utterance .
Parsing [sent. 1335 len. 31]: In the cases of Sir Fulk Grevill and Sir John Davies , the feeling is assuredly profound ; but in form and expression the philosophy has quite the upper hand .
Parsing [sent. 1336 len. 20]: We must not therefore suppose , however , that the cause of religious poetry has been a losing one .
Parsing [sent. 1337 len. 18]: The last wave must sink that the next may rise , and the whole tide flow shorewards .
Parsing [sent. 1338 len. 44]: The man must awake through all his soul , all his strength , all his mind , that he may worship God in unity , in the one harmonious utterance of his being : his heart must be united to fear his name .
Parsing [sent. 1339 len. 13]: And for this final perfection of the individual the race must awake .
Parsing [sent. 1340 len. 35]: At this season and that season , this power or that power must be chiefly developed in her elect ; and for its sake the growth of others must for a season be delayed .
Parsing [sent. 1341 len. 60]: But the next generation will inherit all that has gone before ; and its elect , if they be themselves pure in heart , and individual , that is original , in mind , will , more or less thoroughly , embody the result , in subservience to some new development , essential in its turn to further progress .
Parsing [sent. 1342 len. 25]: Even the fallow times , which we are so ready to call barren , must have their share in working the one needful work .
Parsing [sent. 1343 len. 24]: They may be to the nation that which sickness so often is to the man -- a time of refreshing from the Lord .
Parsing [sent. 1344 len. 26]: A nation 's life does not lie in its utterance any more than in the things which it possesses : it lies in its action .
Parsing [sent. 1345 len. 26]: The utterance is a result , and therefore a sign , of life ; but there may be life without any _ such _ sign .
Parsing [sent. 1346 len. 52]: To do justice , to love mercy , to walk humbly with God , is the highest life of a nation as of an individual ; and when the time for speech comes , it will be such life alone that causes the speech to be strong at once and harmonious .
Parsing [sent. 1347 len. 29]: When at last there are not ten righteous men in Sodom , Sodom can neither think , act , nor say , and her destruction is at hand .
Parsing [sent. 1348 len. 23]: While the wave of the dramatic was sinking , the wave of the lyric was growing in force and rising in height .
Parsing [sent. 1349 len. 15]: Especially as regards religious poetry we are as yet only approaching the lyrical jubilee .
Parsing [sent. 1350 len. 17]: Fact and faith , self-consciousness and metaphysics , all are needful to the lyric of love .
Parsing [sent. 1351 len. 19]: Modesty and art find their grandest , simplest labour in rightly subordinating each of those to the others .
Parsing [sent. 1352 len. 10]: How could we have a George Herbert without metaphysics ?
Parsing [sent. 1353 len. 17]: In those poems I have just given , the way of metaphysics was prepared for him .
Parsing [sent. 1354 len. 33]: That which overcolours one age to the injury of its harmony , will , in the next or the next , fall into its own place in the seven-chorded rainbow of truth .
Parsing [sent. 1355 len. 3]: CHAPTER VII .
Parsing [sent. 1356 len. 3]: DR. DONNE .
Parsing [sent. 1357 len. 42]: We now come to Dr. John Donne , a man of justly great respect and authority , who , born in the year 1573 , the fifteenth of Queen Elizabeth , died Dean of St. Paul 's in the year 1636 .
Parsing [sent. 1358 len. 53]: But , although even Ben Jonson addresses him as `` the delight of Phoebus and each Muse , '' we are too far beyond the power of his social presence and the influence of his public utterances to feel that admiration of his poems which was so largely expressed during his lifetime .
Parsing [sent. 1359 len. 28]: Of many of those that were written in his youth , Izaak Walton says Dr. Donne `` wished that his own eyes had witnessed their funerals . ''
Parsing [sent. 1360 len. 21]: Faulty as they are , however , they are not the less the work of a great and earnest man .
Parsing [sent. 1361 len. 42]: Bred to the law , but never having practised it , he lost his secretaryship to the Lord Chancellor Ellesmere through the revenge of Sir George More , whose daughter Donne had married in secret because of her father 's opposition .
Parsing [sent. 1362 len. 68]: Dependent thereafter for years on the generous kindness of unrelated friends , he yet for conscience ' sake refused to take orders when a good living was offered him ; and it was only after prolonged thought that he yielded to the importunity of King James , who was so convinced of his surpassing fitness for the church that he would speed him towards no other goal .
Parsing [sent. 1363 len. 55]: When at length he dared hope that God might have called him to the high office , never man gave himself to its duties with more of whole-heartedness and devotion , and none have proved themselves more clean of the sacrilege of serving at the altar for the sake of the things offered thereon .
Parsing [sent. 1364 len. 37]: He is represented by Dr. Johnson as one of the chief examples of that school of poets called by himself the _ metaphysical _ , an epithet which , as a definition , is almost false .
Parsing [sent. 1365 len. 35]: True it is that Donne and his followers were always ready to deal with metaphysical subjects , but it was from their mode , and not their subjects , that Dr. Johnson classed them .
Parsing [sent. 1366 len. 50]: What this mode was we shall see presently , for I shall be justified in setting forth its strangeness , even absurdity , by the fact that Dr. Donne was the dear friend of George Herbert , and had much to do with the formation of his poetic habits .
Parsing [sent. 1367 len. 36]: Just twenty years older than Herbert , and the valued and intimate friend of his mother , Donne was in precisely that relation of age and circumstance to influence the other in the highest degree .
Parsing [sent. 1368 len. 53]: The central thought of Dr. Donne is nearly sure to be just : the subordinate thoughts by means of which he unfolds it are often grotesque , and so wildly associated as to remind one of the lawlessness of a dream , wherein mere suggestion without choice or fitness rules the sequence .
Parsing [sent. 1369 len. 33]: As some of the writers of whom I have last spoken would play with words , Dr. Donne would sport with ideas , and with the visual images or embodiments of them .
Parsing [sent. 1370 len. 26]: Certainly in his case much knowledge reveals itself in the association of his ideas , and great facility in the management and utterance of them .
Parsing [sent. 1371 len. 72]: True likewise , he says nothing unrelated to the main idea of the poem ; but not the less certainly does the whole resemble the speech of a child of active imagination , to whom judgment as to the character of his suggestions is impossible , his taste being equally gratified with a lovely image and a brilliant absurdity : a butterfly and a shining potsherd are to him similarly desirable .
Parsing [sent. 1372 len. 35]: Whatever wild thing starts from the thicket of thought , all is worthy game to the hunting intellect of Dr. Donne , and is followed without question of tone , keeping , or harmony .
Parsing [sent. 1373 len. 58]: In his play with words , Sir Philip Sidney kept good heed that even that should serve the end in view ; in his play with ideas , Dr. John Donne , so far from serving the end , sometimes obscures it almost hopelessly : the hart escapes while he follows the squirrels and weasels and bats .
Parsing [sent. 1374 len. 38]: It is not surprising that , their author being so inartistic with regard to their object , his verses themselves should be harsh and unmusical beyond the worst that one would imagine fit to be called verse .
Parsing [sent. 1375 len. 18]: He enjoys the unenviable distinction of having no rival in ruggedness of metric movement and associated sounds .
Parsing [sent. 1376 len. 37]: This is clearly the result of indifference ; an indifference , however , which grows very strange to us when we find that he _ can _ write a lovely verse and even an exquisite stanza .
Parsing [sent. 1377 len. 56]: Greatly for its own sake , partly for the sake of illustration , I quote a poem containing at once his best and his worst , the result being such an incongruity that we wonder whether it might not be called his best _ and _ his worst , because we can not determine which .
Parsing [sent. 1378 len. 16]: He calls it _ Hymn to God , my God , in my Sickness _ .
Parsing [sent. 1379 len. 13]: The first stanza is worthy of George Herbert in his best mood .
Parsing [sent. 1380 len. 47]: Since I am coming to that holy room , Where with the choir of saints for evermore I shall be made thy music , as I come I tune the instrument here at the door , And what I must do then , think here before .
Parsing [sent. 1381 len. 44]: To recognize its beauty , leaving aside the depth and truth of the phrase , `` Where I shall be made thy music , '' we must recall the custom of those days to send out for `` a noise of musicians . ''
Parsing [sent. 1382 len. 57]: Hence he imagines that he has been summoned as one of a band already gone in to play before the king of `` The High Countries : '' he is now at the door , where he is listening to catch the tone , that he may have his instrument tuned and ready before he enters .
Parsing [sent. 1383 len. 17]: But with what a jar the next stanza breaks on heart , mind , and ear !
Parsing [sent. 1384 len. 109]: Whilst my physicians by their love are grown Cosmographers , and I -LSB- 72 -RSB- their map , who lie Flat on this bed , that by them may be shown That this is my south-west discovery , _ Per fretum febris _ -- by these straits to die ; -- Here , in the midst of comparing himself to a map , and his physicians to cosmographers consulting the map , he changes without warning into a navigator whom they are trying to follow upon the map as he passes through certain straits -- namely , those of the fever -- towards his south-west discovery , Death .
Parsing [sent. 1385 len. 23]: Grotesque as this is , the absurdity deepens in the end of the next stanza by a return to the former idea .
Parsing [sent. 1386 len. 15]: He is alternately a map and a man sailing on the map of himself .
Parsing [sent. 1387 len. 31]: But the first half of the stanza is lovely : my reader must remember that the region of the West was at that time the Land of Promise to England .
Parsing [sent. 1388 len. 27]: I joy that in these straits I see my West ; For though those currents yield return to none , What shall my West hurt me ?
Parsing [sent. 1389 len. 24]: As west and east In all flat maps -LRB- and I am one -RRB- are one , So death doth touch the resurrection .
Parsing [sent. 1390 len. 22]: It is hardly worth while , except for the strangeness of the phenomenon , to spend any time in elucidating this .
Parsing [sent. 1391 len. 27]: Once more a map , he is that of the two hemispheres , in which the east of the one touches the west of the other .
Parsing [sent. 1392 len. 25]: Could anything be much more unmusical than the line , `` In all flat maps -LRB- and I am one -RRB- are one '' ?
Parsing [sent. 1393 len. 7]: But the next stanza is worse .
Parsing [sent. 1394 len. 7]: Is the Pacific sea my home ?
Parsing [sent. 1395 len. 6]: Or are The eastern riches ?
Parsing [sent. 1396 len. 3]: Is Jerusalem ?
Parsing [sent. 1397 len. 8]: Anvan , and Magellan , and Gibraltar ?
Parsing [sent. 1398 len. 23]: All straits , and none but straits are ways to them , Whether where Japhet dwelt , or Cham , or Sem .
Parsing [sent. 1399 len. 36]: The meaning of the stanza is this : there is no earthly home : all these places are only straits that lead home , just as they themselves can not be reached but through straits .
Parsing [sent. 1400 len. 75]: Let my reader now forget all but the first stanza , and take it along with the following , the last two : We think that Paradise and Calvary , Christ 's cross and Adam 's tree , stood in one place : Look , Lord , and find both Adams met in me ; As the first Adam 's sweat surrounds my face , May the last Adam 's blood my soul embrace .
Parsing [sent. 1401 len. 57]: So , in his purple wrapped , receive me , Lord ; By these his thorns give me his other crown ; And as to others ' souls I preached thy word , Be this my text , my sermon to mine own : _ Therefore , that he may raise , the Lord throws down .
Parsing [sent. 1402 len. 23]: _ Surely these are very fine , especially the middle verse of the former and the first verse of the latter stanza .
Parsing [sent. 1403 len. 28]: The three stanzas together make us lovingly regret that Dr. Donne should have ridden his Pegasus over quarry and housetop , instead of teaching him his paces .
Parsing [sent. 1404 len. 8]: The next I quote is artistic throughout .
Parsing [sent. 1405 len. 67]: Perhaps the fact , of which we are informed by Izaak Walton , `` that he caused it to be set to a grave and solemn tune , and to be often sung to the organ by the choristers of St. Paul 's church in his own hearing , especially at the evening service , '' may have something to do with its degree of perfection .
Parsing [sent. 1406 len. 11]: There is no sign of his usual haste about it .
Parsing [sent. 1407 len. 23]: It is even elaborately rhymed after Norman fashion , the rhymes in each stanza being consonant with the rhymes in every stanza .
Parsing [sent. 1408 len. 7]: A HYMN TO GOD THE FATHER .
Parsing [sent. 1409 len. 20]: Wilt thou forgive that sin where I begun , Which was my sin , though it were done before ?
Parsing [sent. 1410 len. 28]: -LSB- 73 -RSB- Wilt thou forgive that sin , through which I run , -LSB- 74 -RSB- And do run still , though still I do deplore ?
Parsing [sent. 1411 len. 16]: -- When thou hast done , thou hast not done ; For I have more .
Parsing [sent. 1412 len. 20]: Wilt thou forgive that sin which I have won Others to sin , and made my sins their door ?
Parsing [sent. 1413 len. 23]: -LSB- 75 -RSB- Wilt thou forgive that sin which I did shun A year or two , but wallowed in a score ?
Parsing [sent. 1414 len. 16]: -- When thou hast done , thou hast not done ; For I have more .
Parsing [sent. 1415 len. 58]: I have a sin of fear , that when I 've spun My last thread , I shall perish on the shore ; But swear by thyself , that at my death thy Son Shall shine , as he shines now and heretofore ; And having done that , thou hast done : I fear no more .
Parsing [sent. 1416 len. 55]: In those days even a pun might be a serious thing : witness the play in the last stanza on the words _ son _ and _ sun _ -- not a mere pun , for the Son of the Father is the Sun of Righteousness : he is Life _ and _ Light .
Parsing [sent. 1417 len. 20]: What the Doctor himself says concerning the hymn , appears to me not only interesting but of practical value .
Parsing [sent. 1418 len. 39]: He `` did occasionally say to a friend , ` The words of this hymn have restored to me the same thoughts of joy that possessed my soul in my sickness , when I composed it . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 1419 len. 35]: What a help it would be to many , if in their more gloomy times they would but recall the visions of truth they had , and were assured of , in better moments !
Parsing [sent. 1420 len. 33]: Here is a somewhat strange hymn , which yet possesses , rightly understood , a real grandeur : A HYMN TO CHRIST _ At the Author 's last going into Germany _ .
Parsing [sent. 1421 len. 39]: -LSB- 76 -RSB- In what torn ship soever I embark , That ship shall be my emblem of thy ark ; What sea soever swallow me , that flood Shall be to me an emblem of thy blood .
Parsing [sent. 1422 len. 33]: Though thou with clouds of anger do disguise Thy face , yet through that mask I know those eyes , Which , though they turn away sometimes -- They never will despise .
Parsing [sent. 1423 len. 40]: I sacrifice this island unto thee , And all whom I love here and who love me : When I have put this flood ` twixt them and me , Put thou thy blood betwixt my sins and thee .
Parsing [sent. 1424 len. 38]: As the tree 's sap doth seek the root below In winter , in my winter -LSB- 77 -RSB- now I go Where none but thee , the eternal root Of true love , I may know .
Parsing [sent. 1425 len. 37]: Nor thou , nor thy religion , dost control The amorousness of an harmonious soul ; But thou wouldst have that love thyself : as thou Art jealous , Lord , so I am jealous now .
Parsing [sent. 1426 len. 43]: Thou lov ` st not , till from loving more thou free My soul : who ever gives , takes liberty : Oh , if thou car ` st not whom I love , Alas , thou lov ` st not me !
Parsing [sent. 1427 len. 43]: Seal then this bill of my divorce to all On whom those fainter beams of love did fall ; Marry those loves , which in youth scattered be On face , wit , hopes , -LRB- false mistresses -RRB- , to thee .
Parsing [sent. 1428 len. 55]: Churches are best for prayer that have least light : To see God only , I go out of sight ; And , to ` scape stormy days , I choose An everlasting night To do justice to this poem , the reader must take some trouble to enter into the poet 's mood .
Parsing [sent. 1429 len. 53]: It is in a measure distressing that , while I grant with all my heart the claim of his `` Muse 's white sincerity , '' the taste in -- I do not say _ of _ -- some of his best poems should be such that I will not present them .
Parsing [sent. 1430 len. 26]: Out of twenty-three _ Holy Sonnets _ , every one of which , I should almost say , possesses something remarkable , I choose three .
Parsing [sent. 1431 len. 24]: Rhymed after the true Petrarchian fashion , their rhythm is often as bad as it can be to be called rhythm at all .
Parsing [sent. 1432 len. 6]: Yet these are very fine .
Parsing [sent. 1433 len. 11]: Thou hast made me , and shall thy work decay ?
Parsing [sent. 1434 len. 31]: Repair me now , for now mine end doth haste ; I run to death , and death meets me as fast , And all my pleasures are like yesterday .
Parsing [sent. 1435 len. 39]: I dare not move my dim eyes any way , Despair behind , and death before doth cast Such terror ; and my feeble flesh doth waste By sin in it , which it towards hell doth weigh .
Parsing [sent. 1436 len. 57]: Only them art above , and when towards thee By thy leave I can look , I rise again ; But our old subtle foe so tempteth me , That not one hour myself I can sustain : Thy grace may wing me to prevent his art , And thou like adamant draw mine iron heart .
Parsing [sent. 1437 len. 72]: If faithful souls be alike glorified As angels , then my father 's soul doth see , And adds this even to full felicity , That valiantly I hell 's wide mouth o'erstride : But if our minds to these souls be descried By circumstances and by signs that be Apparent in us -- not immediately -LSB- 78 -RSB- -- How shall my mind 's white truth by them be tried ?
Parsing [sent. 1438 len. 27]: They see idolatrous lovers weep and mourn , And , style blasphemous , conjurors to call On Jesu 's name , and pharisaical Dissemblers feign devotiön .
Parsing [sent. 1439 len. 25]: Then turn , O pensive soul , to God ; for he knows best Thy grief , for he put it into my breast .
Parsing [sent. 1440 len. 45]: Death , be not proud , though some have calléd thee Mighty and dreadful , for thou art not so ; For those whom thou think ` st thou dost overthrow , Die not , poor Death ; nor yet canst thou kill me .
Parsing [sent. 1441 len. 45]: From rest and sleep , which but thy picture be , Much pleasure , then from thee much more must flow ; And soonest -LSB- 79 -RSB- our best men with thee do go , Rest of their bones , and soul 's delivery !
Parsing [sent. 1442 len. 43]: Thou ` rt slave to fate , chance , kings , and desperate men , And dost with poison , war , and sickness dwell ; And poppy or charms can make us sleep as well , And better than thy stroke .
Parsing [sent. 1443 len. 10]: Why swell ` st -LSB- 80 -RSB- thou then ?
Parsing [sent. 1444 len. 22]: One short sleep past , we wake eternally , And death shall be no more : Death , thou shalt die .
Parsing [sent. 1445 len. 26]: In a poem called _ The Cross _ , full of fantastic conceits , we find the following remarkable lines , embodying the profoundest truth .
Parsing [sent. 1446 len. 42]: As perchance carvers do not faces make , But that away , which hid them there , do take : Let crosses so take what hid Christ in thee , And be his image , or not his , but he .
Parsing [sent. 1447 len. 13]: One more , and we shall take our leave of Dr. Donne .
Parsing [sent. 1448 len. 13]: It is called a fragment ; but it seems to me complete .
Parsing [sent. 1449 len. 26]: It will serve as a specimen of his best and at the same time of his most characteristic mode of presenting fine thoughts grotesquely attired .
Parsing [sent. 1450 len. 2]: RESURRECTION .
Parsing [sent. 1451 len. 27]: Sleep , sleep , old sun ; thou canst not have re-past -LSB- 81 -RSB- As yet the wound thou took ` st on Friday last .
Parsing [sent. 1452 len. 96]: Sleep then , and rest : the world may bear thy stay ; A better sun rose before thee to-day ; Who , not content to enlighten all that dwell On the earth 's face as thou , enlightened hell , And made the dark fires languish in that vale , As at thy presence here our fires grow pale ; Whose body , having walked on earth and now Hastening to heaven , would , that he might allow Himself unto all stations and fill all , For these three days become a mineral .
Parsing [sent. 1453 len. 38]: He was all gold when he lay down , but rose All tincture ; and doth not alone dispose Leaden and iron wills to good , but is Of power to make even sinful flesh like his .
Parsing [sent. 1454 len. 57]: Had one of those , whose credulous piety Thought that a soul one might discern and see Go from a body , at this sepulchre been , And issuing from the sheet this body seen , He would have justly thought this body a soul , If not of any man , yet of the whole .
Parsing [sent. 1455 len. 28]: What a strange mode of saying that he is our head , the captain of our salvation , the perfect humanity in which our life is hid !
Parsing [sent. 1456 len. 6]: Yet it has its dignity .
Parsing [sent. 1457 len. 23]: When one has got over the oddity of these last six lines , the figure contained in them shows itself almost grand .
Parsing [sent. 1458 len. 84]: As an individual specimen of the grotesque form holding a fine sense , regard for a moment the words , He was all gold when he lay down , but rose All tincture ; which means , that , entirely good when he died , he was something yet greater when he rose , for he had gained the power of making others good : the _ tincture _ intended here was a substance whose touch would turn the basest metal into gold .
Parsing [sent. 1459 len. 32]: Through his poems are scattered many fine passages ; but not even his large influence on the better poets who followed is sufficient to justify our listening to him longer now .
Parsing [sent. 1460 len. 3]: CHAPTER VIII .
Parsing [sent. 1461 len. 6]: BISHOP HALL AND GEORGE SANDYS .
Parsing [sent. 1462 len. 30]: Joseph Hall , born in 1574 , a year after Dr. Donne , bishop , first of Exeter , next of Norwich , is best known by his satires .
Parsing [sent. 1463 len. 23]: It is not for such that I can mention him : the most honest satire can claim no place amongst religious poems .
Parsing [sent. 1464 len. 10]: It is doubtful if satire ever did any good .
Parsing [sent. 1465 len. 15]: Its very language is that of the half-brute from which it is well named .
Parsing [sent. 1466 len. 15]: Here are three poems , however , which the bishop wrote for his choir .
Parsing [sent. 1467 len. 7]: ANTHEM FOR THE CATHEDRAL OF EXETER .
Parsing [sent. 1468 len. 6]: Lord , what am I ?
Parsing [sent. 1469 len. 9]: A worm , dust , vapour , nothing !
Parsing [sent. 1470 len. 5]: What is my life ?
Parsing [sent. 1471 len. 7]: A dream , a daily dying !
Parsing [sent. 1472 len. 5]: What is my flesh ?
Parsing [sent. 1473 len. 6]: My soul 's uneasy clothing !
Parsing [sent. 1474 len. 5]: What is my time ?
Parsing [sent. 1475 len. 26]: A minute ever flying : My time , my flesh , my life , and I , What are we , Lord , but vanity ?
Parsing [sent. 1476 len. 6]: Where am I , Lord ?
Parsing [sent. 1477 len. 7]: Down in a vale of death .
Parsing [sent. 1478 len. 5]: What is my trade ?
Parsing [sent. 1479 len. 19]: Sin , my dear God offending ; My sport sin too , my stay a puff of breath .
Parsing [sent. 1480 len. 5]: What end of sin ?
Parsing [sent. 1481 len. 27]: Hell 's horror never ending : My way , my trade , sport , stay , and place , Help to make up my doleful case .
Parsing [sent. 1482 len. 6]: Lord , what art thou ?
Parsing [sent. 1483 len. 9]: Pure life , power , beauty , bliss .
Parsing [sent. 1484 len. 6]: Where dwell ` st thou ?
Parsing [sent. 1485 len. 6]: Up above in perfect light .
Parsing [sent. 1486 len. 5]: What is thy time ?
Parsing [sent. 1487 len. 4]: Eternity it is .
Parsing [sent. 1488 len. 3]: What state ?
Parsing [sent. 1489 len. 24]: Attendance of each glorious sprite : Thyself , thy place , thy days , thy state Pass all the thoughts of powers create .
Parsing [sent. 1490 len. 8]: How shall I reach thee , Lord ?
Parsing [sent. 1491 len. 8]: Oh , soar above , Ambitious soul .
Parsing [sent. 1492 len. 7]: But which way should I fly ?
Parsing [sent. 1493 len. 9]: Thou , Lord , art way and end .
Parsing [sent. 1494 len. 5]: What wings have I ?
Parsing [sent. 1495 len. 28]: Aspiring thoughts -- of faith , of hope , of love : Oh , let these wings , that way alone Present me to thy blissful throne .
Parsing [sent. 1496 len. 3]: FOR CHRISTMAS-DAY .
Parsing [sent. 1497 len. 31]: Immortal babe , who this dear day Didst change thine heaven for our clay , And didst with flesh thy Godhead veil , Eternal Son of God , all hail !
Parsing [sent. 1498 len. 5]: Shine , happy star !
Parsing [sent. 1499 len. 12]: Ye angels , sing Glory on high to heaven 's king !
Parsing [sent. 1500 len. 9]: Run , shepherds , leave your nightly watch !
Parsing [sent. 1501 len. 9]: See heaven come down to Bethlehem 's cratch !
Parsing [sent. 1502 len. 3]: _ manger .
Parsing [sent. 1503 len. 17]: _ Worship , ye sages of the east , The king of gods in meanness drest !
Parsing [sent. 1504 len. 17]: O blessed maid , smile , and adore The God thy womb and arms have bore !
Parsing [sent. 1505 len. 10]: Star , angels , shepherds , and wise sages !
Parsing [sent. 1506 len. 6]: Thou virgin-glory of all ages !
Parsing [sent. 1507 len. 7]: Restored frame of heaven and earth !
Parsing [sent. 1508 len. 8]: Joy in your dear Redeemer 's birth .
Parsing [sent. 1509 len. 57]: * * * * * Leave , O my soul , this baser world below ; O leave this doleful dungeön of woe ; And soar aloft to that supernal rest That maketh all the saints and angels blest : Lo , there the Godhead 's radiant throne , Like to ten thousand suns in one !
Parsing [sent. 1510 len. 14]: Lo , there thy Saviour dear , in glory dight , _ dressed .
Parsing [sent. 1511 len. 10]: _ Adored of all the powers of heavens bright !
Parsing [sent. 1512 len. 18]: Lo , where that head that bled with thorny wound , Shines ever with celestíal honour crowned !
Parsing [sent. 1513 len. 14]: That hand that held the scornful reed Makes all the fiends infernal dread .
Parsing [sent. 1514 len. 38]: That back and side that ran with bloody streams Daunt angels ' eyes with their majestic beams ; Those feet , once fastened to the cursed tree , Trample on Death and Hell , in glorious glee .
Parsing [sent. 1515 len. 19]: Those lips , once drenched with gall , do make With their dread doom the world to quake .
Parsing [sent. 1516 len. 37]: Behold those joys thou never canst behold ; Those precious gates of pearl , those streets of gold , Those streams of life , those trees of Paradise That never can be seen by mortal eyes !
Parsing [sent. 1517 len. 17]: And when thou seest this state divine , Think that it is or shall be thine .
Parsing [sent. 1518 len. 16]: See there the happy troops of purest sprites That live above in endless true delights !
Parsing [sent. 1519 len. 16]: And see where once thyself shalt rangéd be , And look and long for immortality !
Parsing [sent. 1520 len. 12]: And now beforehand help to sing Hallelujahs to heaven 's king .
Parsing [sent. 1521 len. 52]: Polished as these are in comparison to those of Dr. Donne , and fine , too , as they are intrinsically , there are single phrases in his that are worth them all -- except , indeed , that one splendid line , Trample on Death and Hell in glorious glee .
Parsing [sent. 1522 len. 30]: George Sandys , the son of an archbishop of York , and born in 1577 , is better known by his travels in the east than by his poetry .
Parsing [sent. 1523 len. 20]: But his version of the Psalms is in good and various verse , not unfrequently graceful , sometimes fine .
Parsing [sent. 1524 len. 18]: The following is not only in a popular rhythm , but is neat and melodious as well .
Parsing [sent. 1525 len. 3]: PSALM XCII .
Parsing [sent. 1526 len. 43]: Thou who art enthroned above , Thou by whom we live and move , O how sweet , how excellent Is ' t with tongue and heart 's consent , Thankful hearts and joyful tongues , To renown thy name in songs !
Parsing [sent. 1527 len. 27]: When the morning paints the skies , When the sparkling stars arise , Thy high favours to rehearse , Thy firm faith , in grateful verse !
Parsing [sent. 1528 len. 24]: Take the lute and violin , Let the solemn harp begin , Instruments strung with ten strings , While the silver cymbal rings .
Parsing [sent. 1529 len. 14]: From thy works my joy proceeds ; How I triumph in thy deeds !
Parsing [sent. 1530 len. 6]: Who thy wonders can express ?
Parsing [sent. 1531 len. 20]: All thy thoughts are fathomless -- Hid from men in knowledge blind , Hid from fools to vice inclined .
Parsing [sent. 1532 len. 31]: Who that tyrant sin obey , Though they spring like flowers in May -- Parched with heat , and nipt with frost , Soon shall fade , for ever lost .
Parsing [sent. 1533 len. 15]: Lord , thou art most great , most high ; Such from all eternity .
Parsing [sent. 1534 len. 11]: Perish shall thy enemies , Rebels that against thee rise .
Parsing [sent. 1535 len. 36]: All who in their sins delight , Shall be scattered by thy might But thou shall exalt my horn Like a youthful unicorn , Fresh and fragrant odours shed On thy crowned prophet 's head .
Parsing [sent. 1536 len. 36]: I shall see my foes ' defeat , Shortly hear of their retreat ; But the just like palms shall flourish Which the plains of Judah nourish , Like tall cedars mounted on Cloud-ascending Lebanon .
Parsing [sent. 1537 len. 28]: Plants set in thy court , below Spread their roots , and upwards grow ; Fruit in their old age shall bring , Ever fat and flourishing .
Parsing [sent. 1538 len. 14]: This God 's justice celebrates : He , my rock , injustice hates .
Parsing [sent. 1539 len. 3]: PSALM CXXIII .
Parsing [sent. 1540 len. 22]: Thou mover of the rolling spheres , I , through the glasses of my tears , To thee my eyes erect .
Parsing [sent. 1541 len. 61]: As servants mark their master 's hands , As maids their mistress 's commands , And liberty expect , So we , depressed by enemies And growing troubles , fix our eyes On God , who sits on high ; Till he in mercy shall descend , To give our miseries an end , And turn our tears to joy .
Parsing [sent. 1542 len. 41]: O save us , Lord , by all forlorn , The subject of contempt and scorn : Defend us from their pride Who live in fluency and ease , Who with our woes their malice please , And miseries deride .
Parsing [sent. 1543 len. 22]: Here is a part of the 66th Psalm , which makes a complete little song of itself : Bless the Lord .
Parsing [sent. 1544 len. 12]: His praise be sung While an ear can hear a tongue .
Parsing [sent. 1545 len. 12]: He our feet establisheth ; He our souls redeems from death .
Parsing [sent. 1546 len. 25]: Lord , as silver purified , Thou hast with affliction tried , Thou hast driven into the net , Burdens on our shoulders set .
Parsing [sent. 1547 len. 41]: Trod on by their horses ' hooves , Theirs whom pity never moves , We through fire , with flames embraced , We through raging floods have passed , Yet by thy conducting hand , Brought into a wealthy land .
Parsing [sent. 1548 len. 3]: CHAPTER IX .
Parsing [sent. 1549 len. 7]: A FEW OF THE ELIZABETHAN DRAMATISTS .
Parsing [sent. 1550 len. 23]: From the nature of their adopted mode , we can not look for much poetry of a devotional kind from the dramatists .
Parsing [sent. 1551 len. 72]: That mode admitting of no utterance personal to the author , and requiring the scope of a play to bring out the intended truth , it is no wonder that , even in the dramas of Shakspere , profound as is the teaching they contain , we should find nothing immediately suitable to our purpose ; while neither has he left anything in other form approaching in kind what we seek .
Parsing [sent. 1552 len. 59]: Ben Jonson , however , born in 1574 , who may be regarded as the sole representative of learning in the class , has left , amongst a large number of small pieces , three _ Poems of Devotion _ , whose merit may not indeed be great , but whose feeling is , I think , genuine .
Parsing [sent. 1553 len. 18]: Whatever were his faults , and they were not few , hypocrisy was not one of them .
Parsing [sent. 1554 len. 7]: His nature was fierce and honest .
Parsing [sent. 1555 len. 10]: He might boast , but he could not pretend .
Parsing [sent. 1556 len. 20]: His oscillation between the reformed and the Romish church can hardly have had other cause than a vacillating conviction .
Parsing [sent. 1557 len. 37]: It could not have served any prudential end that we can see , to turn catholic in the reign of Elizabeth , while in prison for killing in a duel a player who had challenged him .
Parsing [sent. 1558 len. 5]: THE SINNER 'S SACRIFICE .
Parsing [sent. 1559 len. 2]: 1 .
Parsing [sent. 1560 len. 6]: -- TO THE HOLY TRINITY .
Parsing [sent. 1561 len. 49]: O holy , blessed , glorious Trinity Of persons , still one God in Unity , The faithful man 's believed mystery , Help , help to lift Myself up to thee , harrowed , torn , and bruised By sin and Satan , and my flesh misused .
Parsing [sent. 1562 len. 16]: As my heart lies -- in pieces , all confused -- O take my gift .
Parsing [sent. 1563 len. 52]: All-gracious God , the sinner 's sacrifice , A broken heart , thou wert not wont despise , But , ` bove the fat of rams or bulls , to prize An offering meet For thy acceptance : Oh , behold me right , And take compassion on my grievous plight !
Parsing [sent. 1564 len. 15]: What odour can be , than a heart contrite , To thee more sweet ?
Parsing [sent. 1565 len. 37]: Eternal Father , God , who didst create This All of nothing , gav ` st it form and fate , And breath ` st into it life and light , with state To worship thee !
Parsing [sent. 1566 len. 39]: Eternal God the Son , who not deniedst To take our nature , becam ` st man , and diedst , To pay our debts , upon thy cross , and criedst _ All 's done in me !
Parsing [sent. 1567 len. 33]: _ Eternal Spirit , God from both proceeding , Father and Son -- the Comforter , in breeding Pure thoughts in man , with fiery zeal them feeding For acts of grace !
Parsing [sent. 1568 len. 122]: Increase those acts , O glorious Trinity Of persons , still one God in Unity , Till I attain the longed-for mystery Of seeing your face , Beholding one in three , and three in one , A Trinity , to shine in Union -- The gladdest light , dark man can think upon -- O grant it me , Father , and Son , and Holy Ghost , you three , All co-eternal in your majesty , Distinct in persons , yet in unity One God to see ; My Maker , Saviour , and my Sanctifier , To hear , to mediate , -LSB- 82 -RSB- sweeten my desire , With grace , with love , with cherishing entire !
Parsing [sent. 1569 len. 22]: O then , how blest Among thy saints elected to abide , And with thy angels placéd , side by side !
Parsing [sent. 1570 len. 12]: But in thy presence truly glorified , Shall I there rest !
Parsing [sent. 1571 len. 2]: 2 .
Parsing [sent. 1572 len. 8]: -- AN HYMN TO GOD THE FATHER .
Parsing [sent. 1573 len. 6]: Hear me , O God !
Parsing [sent. 1574 len. 21]: A broken heart Is my best part : Use still thy rod , That I may prove Therein thy love .
Parsing [sent. 1575 len. 21]: If thou hadst not Been stern to me , But left me free , I had forgot Myself and thee .
Parsing [sent. 1576 len. 12]: For sin 's so sweet As minds ill bent _ that .
Parsing [sent. 1577 len. 9]: _ Rarely repent Until they meet Their punishment .
Parsing [sent. 1578 len. 9]: Who more can crave Than thou hast done ?
Parsing [sent. 1579 len. 21]: Thou gay ` st a Son To free a slave , First made of nought , With all since bought .
Parsing [sent. 1580 len. 21]: Sin , death , and hell His glorious name Quite overcame ; Yet I rebel , And slight the same .
Parsing [sent. 1581 len. 20]: But I 'll come in Before my loss Me farther toss , As sure to win Under his cross .
Parsing [sent. 1582 len. 2]: 3 .
Parsing [sent. 1583 len. 10]: -- AN HYMN ON THE NATIVITY OF MY SAVIOUR .
Parsing [sent. 1584 len. 23]: I sing the birth was born to-night , The author both of life and light ; The angels so did sound it .
Parsing [sent. 1585 len. 25]: And like the ravished shepherds said , Who saw the light , and were afraid , Yet searched , and true they found it .
Parsing [sent. 1586 len. 48]: The Son of God , the eternal King , That did us all salvation bring , And freed the soul from danger ; He whom the whole world could not take , The Word which heaven and earth did make , Was now laid in a manger .
Parsing [sent. 1587 len. 48]: The Father 's wisdom willed it so ; The Son 's obedience knew no _ No ; _ Both wills were in one stature ; And , as that wisdom had decreed , The Word was now made flesh indeed , And took on him our nature .
Parsing [sent. 1588 len. 23]: What comfort by him do we win , Who made himself the price of sin , To make us heirs of glory !
Parsing [sent. 1589 len. 15]: To see this babe , all innocence , A martyr born in our defence !
Parsing [sent. 1590 len. 7]: -- Can man forget this story ?
Parsing [sent. 1591 len. 20]: Somewhat formal and artificial , no doubt ; rugged at the same time , like him who wrote them .
Parsing [sent. 1592 len. 33]: When a man would utter that concerning which he has only felt , not thought , he can express himself only in the forms he has been taught , conventional or traditional .
Parsing [sent. 1593 len. 39]: Let his powers be ever so much developed in respect of other things , here , where he has not meditated , he must understand as a child , think as a child , speak as a child .
Parsing [sent. 1594 len. 14]: He can as yet generate no sufficing or worthy form natural to himself .
Parsing [sent. 1595 len. 8]: But the utterance is not therefore untrue .
Parsing [sent. 1596 len. 20]: There was no professional bias to cause the stream of Ben Jonson 's verses to flow in that channel .
Parsing [sent. 1597 len. 50]: Indeed , feeling without thought , and the consequent combination of impulse to speak with lack of matter , is the cause of much of that common-place utterance concerning things of religion which is so wearisome , but which therefore it is not always fair to despise as cant .
Parsing [sent. 1598 len. 74]: About the same age as Ben Jonson , though the date of his birth is unknown , I now come to mention Thomas Heywood , a most voluminous writer of plays , who wrote also a book , chiefly in verse , called _ The Hierarchy of the Blessed Angels _ , a strange work , in which , amongst much that is far from poetic , occur the following remarkable metaphysico-religious verses .
Parsing [sent. 1599 len. 36]: He had strong Platonic tendencies , interesting himself chiefly however in those questions afterwards pursued by Dr. Henry More , concerning witches and such like subjects , which may be called the shadow of Platonism .
Parsing [sent. 1600 len. 30]: I have wandered like a sheep that 's lost , To find Thee out in every coast : _ Without _ I have long seeking bin , _ been .
Parsing [sent. 1601 len. 14]: _ Whilst thou , the while , abid ` st _ within _ .
Parsing [sent. 1602 len. 21]: Through every broad street and strait lane Of this world 's city , but in vain , I have enquired .
Parsing [sent. 1603 len. 4]: The reason why ?
Parsing [sent. 1604 len. 29]: I sought thee ill : for how could I Find thee _ abroad _ , when thou , mean space , Hadst made _ within _ thy dwelling-place ?
Parsing [sent. 1605 len. 46]: I sent my messengers about , To try if they could find thee out ; But all was to no purpose still , Because indeed they sought thee ill : For how could they discover thee That saw not when thou entered ` st me ?
Parsing [sent. 1606 len. 6]: Mine eyes could tell me ?
Parsing [sent. 1607 len. 13]: If he were , Not coloured , sure he came not there .
Parsing [sent. 1608 len. 17]: If not by sound , my ears could say He doubtless did not pass my way .
Parsing [sent. 1609 len. 16]: My nose could nothing of him tell , Because my God he did not smell .
Parsing [sent. 1610 len. 16]: None such I relished , said my taste , And therefore me he never passed .
Parsing [sent. 1611 len. 16]: My feeling told me that none such There entered , for he none did touch .
Parsing [sent. 1612 len. 23]: Resolved by them how should I be , Since none of all these are in thee , In thee , my God ?
Parsing [sent. 1613 len. 44]: Thou hast no hue That man 's frail optic sense can view ; No sound the ear hears ; odour none The smell attracts ; all taste is gone At thy appearance ; where doth fail A body , how can touch prevail ?
Parsing [sent. 1614 len. 16]: What even the brute beasts comprehend -- To think thee such , I should offend .
Parsing [sent. 1615 len. 38]: Yet when I seek my God , I enquire For light than sun and moon much higher , More clear and splendrous , ` bove all light Which the eye receives not , 't is so bright .
Parsing [sent. 1616 len. 52]: I seek a voice beyond degree Of all melodious harmony : The ear conceives it not ; a smell Which doth all other scents excel : No flower so sweet , no myrrh , no nard , Or aloës , with it compared ; Of which the brain not sensible is .
Parsing [sent. 1617 len. 22]: I seek a sweetness -- such a bliss As hath all other sweets surpassed , And never palate yet could taste .
Parsing [sent. 1618 len. 16]: I seek that to contain and hold No touch can feel , no embrace enfold .
Parsing [sent. 1619 len. 15]: So far this light the rays extends , As that no place it comprehends .
Parsing [sent. 1620 len. 20]: So deep this sound , that though it speak It can not by a sense so weak Be entertained .
Parsing [sent. 1621 len. 12]: A redolent grace The air blows not from place to place .
Parsing [sent. 1622 len. 13]: A pleasant taste , of that delight It doth confound all appetite .
Parsing [sent. 1623 len. 18]: A strict embrace , not felt , yet leaves That virtue , where it takes it cleaves .
Parsing [sent. 1624 len. 38]: This light , this sound , this savouring grace , This tasteful sweet , this strict embrace , No place contains , no eye can see , My God is , and there 's none but he .
Parsing [sent. 1625 len. 7]: Very remarkable verses from a dramatist !
Parsing [sent. 1626 len. 14]: They indicate substratum enough for any art if only the art be there .
Parsing [sent. 1627 len. 80]: Even those who can not enter into the philosophy of them , which ranks him among the mystics of whom I have yet to speak , will understand a good deal of it symbolically : for how could he be expected to keep his poetry and his philosophy distinct when of themselves they were so ready to run into one ; or in verse to define carefully betwixt degree and kind , when kinds themselves may rise by degrees ?
Parsing [sent. 1628 len. 59]: To distinguish without separating ; to be able to see that what in their effects upon us are quite different , may yet be a grand flight of ascending steps , `` to stop -- no record hath told where , '' belongs to the philosopher who is not born mutilated , but is a poet as well .
Parsing [sent. 1629 len. 22]: John Fletcher , likewise a dramatist , the author of the following poem , was two years younger than Ben Jonson .
Parsing [sent. 1630 len. 20]: It is , so far as I am aware , the sole non-dramatic voice he has left behind him .
Parsing [sent. 1631 len. 24]: Its opening is an indignant apostrophe to certain men of pretended science , who in his time were much consulted -- the Astrologers .
Parsing [sent. 1632 len. 7]: UPON AN HONEST MAN 'S FORTUNE .
Parsing [sent. 1633 len. 110]: You that can look through heaven , and tell the stars ; Observe their kind conjunctions , and their wars ; Find out new lights , and give them where you please -- To those men honours , pleasures , to those ease ; You that are God 's surveyors , and can show How far , and when , and why the wind doth blow ; Know all the charges of the dreadful thunder , And when it will shoot over , or fall under ; Tell me -- by all your art I conjure ye -- Yes , and by truth -- what shall become of me .
Parsing [sent. 1634 len. 50]: Find out my star , if each one , as you say , Have his peculiar angel , and his way ; Observe my fate ; next fall into your dreams ; Sweep clean your houses , and new-line your schemes ; -LSB- 83 -RSB- Then say your worst .
Parsing [sent. 1635 len. 7]: Or have I none at all ?
Parsing [sent. 1636 len. 7]: Or is it burnt out lately ?
Parsing [sent. 1637 len. 4]: or did fall ?
Parsing [sent. 1638 len. 5]: Or am I poor ?
Parsing [sent. 1639 len. 3]: not able ?
Parsing [sent. 1640 len. 4]: no full flame ?
Parsing [sent. 1641 len. 11]: My star , like me , unworthy of a name ?
Parsing [sent. 1642 len. 26]: Is it your art can only work on those That deal with dangers , dignities , and clothes , With love , or new opinions ?
Parsing [sent. 1643 len. 21]: You all lie : A fishwife hath a fate , and so have I -- But far above your finding .
Parsing [sent. 1644 len. 58]: He that gives , Out of his providence , to all that lives -- And no man knows his treasure , no , not you ; -- * * * * * He that made all the stars you daily read , And from them filch a knowledge how to feed , Hath hid this from you .
Parsing [sent. 1645 len. 55]: Your conjectures all Are drunken things , not how , but when they fall : Man is his own star , and the soul that can Render an honest , and a perfect man , Commands all light , all influence , all fate ; Nothing to him falls early , or too late .
Parsing [sent. 1646 len. 43]: Our acts our angels are , or good or ill , Our fatal shadows that walk by us still ; And when the stars are labouring , we believe It is not that they govern , but they grieve For stubborn ignorance .
Parsing [sent. 1647 len. 31]: All things that are Made for our general uses , are at war -- Even we among ourselves ; and from the strife Your first unlike opinions got a life .
Parsing [sent. 1648 len. 3]: Oh man !
Parsing [sent. 1649 len. 25]: thou image of thy Maker 's good , What canst thou fear , when breathed into thy blood His spirit is that built thee ?
Parsing [sent. 1650 len. 13]: What dull sense Makes thee suspect , in need , that Providence ?
Parsing [sent. 1651 len. 15]: Who made the morning , and who placed the light Guide to thy labours ?
Parsing [sent. 1652 len. 25]: Who called up the night , And bid her fall upon thee like sweet showers In hollow murmurs , to lock up thy powers ?
Parsing [sent. 1653 len. 5]: Who gave thee knowledge ?
Parsing [sent. 1654 len. 16]: Who so trusted thee , To let thee grow so near himself , the Tree ?
Parsing [sent. 1655 len. 9]: -LSB- 84 -RSB- Must he then be distrusted ?
Parsing [sent. 1656 len. 13]: Shall his frame Discourse with him why thus and thus I am ?
Parsing [sent. 1657 len. 20]: He made the angels thine , thy fellows all ; Nay , even thy servants , when devotions call .
Parsing [sent. 1658 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 1659 len. 20]: canst thou be so stupid then , so dim , To seek a saving influence , and lose him ?
Parsing [sent. 1660 len. 5]: Can stars protect thee ?
Parsing [sent. 1661 len. 16]: Or can poverty , Which is the light to heaven , put out his eye ?
Parsing [sent. 1662 len. 42]: He is my star ; in him all truth I find , All influence , all fate ; and when my mind Is furnished with his fulness , my poor story Shall outlive all their age , and all their glory .
Parsing [sent. 1663 len. 44]: The hand of danger can not fall amiss When I know what , and in whose power it is ; Nor want , the cause -LSB- 85 -RSB- of man , shall make me groan : A holy hermit is a mind alone .
Parsing [sent. 1664 len. 21]: -LSB- 86 -RSB- Doth not experience teach us , all we can , To work ourselves into a glorious man ?
Parsing [sent. 1665 len. 23]: * * * * * My mistress then be knowledge and fair truth ; So I enjoy all beauty and all youth !
Parsing [sent. 1666 len. 84]: * * * * * Affliction , when I know it , is but this -- A deep alloy , whereby man tougher is To bear the hammer ; and the deeper still , We still arise more image of his will ; Sickness , an humorous cloud ` twixt us and light ; And death , at longest , but another night , Man is his own star , and that soul that can Be honest , is the only perfect man .
Parsing [sent. 1667 len. 28]: There is a tone of contempt in the verses which is not religious ; but they express a true philosophy and a triumph of faith in God .
Parsing [sent. 1668 len. 13]: The word _ honest _ is here equivalent to _ true _ .
Parsing [sent. 1669 len. 27]: I am not certain whether I may not now be calling up a singer whose song will appear hardly to justify his presence in the choir .
Parsing [sent. 1670 len. 28]: But its teaching is of high import , namely , of content and cheerfulness and courage , and being both worthy and melodious , it gravitates heavenward .
Parsing [sent. 1671 len. 15]: The singer is yet another dramatist : I presume him to be Thomas Dekker .
Parsing [sent. 1672 len. 24]: I can not be certain , because others were concerned with him in the writing of the drama from which I take it .
Parsing [sent. 1673 len. 44]: He it is who , in an often-quoted passage , styles our Lord `` The first true gentleman that ever breathed ; '' just as Chaucer , in a poem I have given , calls him `` The first stock-father of gentleness . ''
Parsing [sent. 1674 len. 11]: We may call the little lyric A SONG OF LABOUR .
Parsing [sent. 1675 len. 10]: Art thou poor , yet hast thou golden slumbers ?
Parsing [sent. 1676 len. 5]: Oh , sweet content !
Parsing [sent. 1677 len. 10]: Art thou rich , yet is thy mind perplexed ?
Parsing [sent. 1678 len. 4]: Oh , punishment !
Parsing [sent. 1679 len. 18]: Dost thou laugh to see how fools are vexed To add to golden numbers , golden numbers ?
Parsing [sent. 1680 len. 5]: Oh , sweet content !
Parsing [sent. 1681 len. 4]: _ Chorus _ .
Parsing [sent. 1682 len. 17]: -- Work apace , apace , apace , apace ; Honest labour bears a lovely face .
Parsing [sent. 1683 len. 9]: Canst drink the waters of the crispéd spring ?
Parsing [sent. 1684 len. 5]: Oh , sweet content !
Parsing [sent. 1685 len. 16]: Swimm ` st thou in wealth , yet sink ` st in thine own tears ?
Parsing [sent. 1686 len. 4]: Oh , punishment !
Parsing [sent. 1687 len. 21]: Then he that patiently want 's burden bears , No burden bears , but is a king , a king !
Parsing [sent. 1688 len. 5]: Oh , sweet content !
Parsing [sent. 1689 len. 4]: _ Chorus _ .
Parsing [sent. 1690 len. 17]: -- Work apace , apace , apace , apace ; Honest labour bears a lovely face .
Parsing [sent. 1691 len. 17]: It is a song of the poor in spirit , whose is the kingdom of heaven .
Parsing [sent. 1692 len. 35]: But if my co-listeners prefer , we will call it the voice , not of one who sings in the choir , but of one who `` tunes his instrument at the door . ''
Parsing [sent. 1693 len. 10]: CHAPTER X. SIR JOHN BEAUMONT AND DRUMMOND OF HAWTHORNDEN .
Parsing [sent. 1694 len. 30]: Sir John Beaumont , born in 1582 , elder brother to the dramatist who wrote along with Fletcher , has left amongst his poems a few fine religious ones .
Parsing [sent. 1695 len. 11]: From them I choose the following : OF THE EPIPHANY .
Parsing [sent. 1696 len. 76]: Fair eastern star , that art ordained to run Before the sages , to the rising sun , Here cease thy course , and wonder that the cloud Of this poor stable can thy Maker shroud : Ye , heavenly bodies , glory to be bright , And are esteemed as ye are rich in light ; But here on earth is taught a different way , Since under this low roof the highest lay .
Parsing [sent. 1697 len. 88]: Jerusalem erects her stately towers , Displays her windows , and adorns her bowers ; Yet there thou must not cast a trembling spark : Let Herod 's palace still continue dark ; Each school and synagogue thy force repels , There Pride , enthroned in misty errors , dwells ; The temple , where the priests maintain their choir , Shall taste no beam of thy celestial fire , While this weak cottage all thy splendour takes : A joyful gate of every chink it makes .
Parsing [sent. 1698 len. 55]: Here shines no golden roof , no ivory stair , No king exalted in a stately chair , Girt with attendants , or by heralds styled , But straw and hay enwrap a speechless child ; Yet Sabae 's lords before this babe unfold Their treasures , offering incense , myrrh , and gold .
Parsing [sent. 1699 len. 164]: The crib becomes an altar : therefore dies No ox nor sheep ; for in their fodder lies The Prince of Peace , who , thankful for his bed , Destroys those rites in which their blood was shed : The quintessence of earth he takes and -LSB- 87 -RSB- fees , And precious gums distilled from weeping trees ; Rich metals and sweet odours now declare The glorious blessings which his laws prepare , To clear us from the base and loathsome flood Of sense , and make us fit for angels ' food , Who lift to God for us the holy smoke Of fervent prayers with which we him invoke , And try our actions in that searching fire , By which the seraphims our lips inspire : No muddy dross pure minerals shall infect , We shall exhale our vapours up direct : No storms shall cross , nor glittering lights deface Perpetual sighs which seek a happy place .
Parsing [sent. 1700 len. 30]: The creatures , no longer offered on his altar , standing around the Prince of Life , to whom they have given a bed , is a lovely idea .
Parsing [sent. 1701 len. 18]: The end is hardly worthy of the rest , though there is fine thought involved in it .
Parsing [sent. 1702 len. 29]: The following contains an utterance of personal experience , the truth of which will be recognized by all to whom heavenly aspiration and needful disappointment are not unknown .
Parsing [sent. 1703 len. 3]: IN DESOLATION .
Parsing [sent. 1704 len. 24]: O thou who sweetly bend ` st my stubborn will , Who send ` st thy stripes to teach and not to kill !
Parsing [sent. 1705 len. 40]: Thy cheerful face from me no longer hide ; Withdraw these clouds , the scourges of my pride ; I sink to hell , if I be lower thrown : I see what man is , being left alone .
Parsing [sent. 1706 len. 36]: My substance , which from nothing did begin , Is worse than nothing by the weight of sin : I see myself in such a wretched state As neither thoughts conceive , nor words relate .
Parsing [sent. 1707 len. 7]: How great a distance parts us !
Parsing [sent. 1708 len. 13]: for in thee Is endless good , and boundless ill in me .
Parsing [sent. 1709 len. 21]: All creatures prove me abject , but how low Thou only know ` st , and teachest me to know .
Parsing [sent. 1710 len. 20]: To paint this baseness , nature is too base ; This darkness yields not but to beams of grace .
Parsing [sent. 1711 len. 9]: Where shall I then this piercing splendour find ?
Parsing [sent. 1712 len. 12]: Or found , how shall it guide me , being blind ?
Parsing [sent. 1713 len. 59]: Grace is a taste of bliss , a glorious gift , Which can the soul to heavenly comforts lift : It will not shine to me , whose mind is drowned In sorrows , and with worldly troubles bound ; It will not deign within that house to dwell , Where dryness reigns , and proud distractions swell .
Parsing [sent. 1714 len. 168]: Perhaps it sought me in those lightsome days Of my first fervour , when few winds did raise The waves , and ere they could full strength obtain , Some whispering gale straight charmed them down again ; When all seemed calm , and yet the Virgin 's child On my devotions in his manger smiled ; While then I simply walked , nor heed could take Of complacence , that sly , deceitful snake ; When yet I had not dangerously refused So many calls to virtue , nor abused The spring of life , which I so oft enjoyed , Nor made so many good intentions void , Deserving thus that grace should quite depart , And dreadful hardness should possess my heart : Yet in that state this only good I found , That fewer spots did then my conscience wound ; Though who can censure whether , in those times , _ judg _ The want of feeling seemed the want of crimes ?
Parsing [sent. 1715 len. 67]: If solid virtues dwell not but in pain , I will not wish that golden age again Because it flowed with sensible delights Of heavenly things : God hath created nights As well as days , to deck the varied globe ; Grace comes as oft clad in the dusky robe Of desolation , as in white attire , Which better fits the bright celestial choir .
Parsing [sent. 1716 len. 18]: Some in foul seasons perish through despair , But more through boldness when the days are fair .
Parsing [sent. 1717 len. 77]: This then must be the medicine for my woes -- To yield to what my Saviour shall dispose ; To glory in my baseness ; to rejoice In mine afflictions ; to obey his voice , As well when threatenings my defects reprove , As when I cherished am with words of love ; To say to him , in every time and place , `` Withdraw thy comforts , so thou leave thy grace . ''
Parsing [sent. 1718 len. 29]: Surely this is as genuine an utterance , whatever its merits as a poem -- and those I judge not small -- as ever flowed from Christian heart !
Parsing [sent. 1719 len. 34]: Chiefly for the sake of its beauty , I give the last passage of a poem written upon occasion of the feasts of the Annunciation and the Resurrection falling on the same day .
Parsing [sent. 1720 len. 11]: Let faithful souls this double feast attend In two processions .
Parsing [sent. 1721 len. 37]: Let the first descend The temple 's stairs , and with a downcast eye Upon the lowest pavement prostrate lie : In creeping violets , white lilies , shine Their humble thoughts and every pure design .
Parsing [sent. 1722 len. 51]: The other troop shall climb , with sacred heat , The rich degrees of Solomon 's bright seat : _ steps _ In glowing roses fervent zeal they bear , And in the azure flower-de-lis appear Celestial contemplations , which aspire Above the sky , up to the immortal choir .
Parsing [sent. 1723 len. 27]: William Drummond of Hawthornden , a Scotchman , born in 1585 , may almost be looked upon as the harbinger of a fresh outburst of word-music .
Parsing [sent. 1724 len. 16]: No doubt all the great poets have now and then broken forth in lyrical jubilation .
Parsing [sent. 1725 len. 44]: Ponderous Ben Jonson himself , when he takes to song , will sing in the joy of the very sound ; but great men have always so much graver work to do , that they comparatively seldom indulge in this kind of melody .
Parsing [sent. 1726 len. 24]: Drummond excels in madrigals , or canzonets -- baby-odes or songs -- which have more of wing and less of thought than sonnets .
Parsing [sent. 1727 len. 55]: Through the greater part of his verse we hear a certain muffled tone of the sweetest , like the music that ever threatens to break out clear from the brook , from the pines , from the rain-shower , -- never does break out clear , but remains a suggested , etherially vanishing tone .
Parsing [sent. 1728 len. 14]: His is a _ voix voilée _ , or veiled voice of song .
Parsing [sent. 1729 len. 108]: It is true that in the time we are now approaching far more attention was paid not merely to the smoothness but to the melody of verse than any except the great masters had paid before ; but some are at the door , who , not being great masters , yet do their inferior part nearly as well as they their higher , uttering a music of marvellous and individual sweetness , which no mere musical care could secure , but which springs essentially from music in the thought gathering to itself musical words in melodious division , and thus fashioning for itself a fitting body .
Parsing [sent. 1730 len. 20]: The melody of their verse is all their own -- as original as the greatest art-forms of the masters .
Parsing [sent. 1731 len. 26]: Of Drummond , then , here are two sonnets on the Nativity ; the first spoken by the angels , the second by the shepherds .
Parsing [sent. 1732 len. 5]: _ The Angels _ .
Parsing [sent. 1733 len. 10]: Run , shepherds , run where Bethlehem blest appears .
Parsing [sent. 1734 len. 31]: We bring the best of news ; be not dismayed : A Saviour there is born more old than years , Amidst heaven 's rolling height this earth who stayed .
Parsing [sent. 1735 len. 49]: In a poor cottage inned , a virgin maid A weakling did him bear , who all upbears ; There is he poorly swaddled , in manger laid , To whom too narrow swaddlings are our spheres : Run , shepherds , run , and solemnize his birth .
Parsing [sent. 1736 len. 33]: This is that night -- no , day , grown great with bliss , In which the power of Satan broken is : In heaven be glory , peace unto the earth !
Parsing [sent. 1737 len. 18]: Thus singing , through the air the angels swam , And cope of stars re-echoëd the same .
Parsing [sent. 1738 len. 5]: _ The Shepherds _ .
Parsing [sent. 1739 len. 10]: O than the fairest day , thrice fairer night !
Parsing [sent. 1740 len. 29]: Night to best days , in which a sun doth rise Of which that golden eye which clears the skies Is but a sparkling ray , a shadow-light !
Parsing [sent. 1741 len. 13]: And blessed ye , in silly pastors ' sight , _ simple .
Parsing [sent. 1742 len. 29]: _ Mild creatures , in whose warm -LSB- 88 -RSB- crib now lies That heaven-sent youngling , holy-maid-born wight , Midst , end , beginning of our prophecies !
Parsing [sent. 1743 len. 9]: Blest cottage that hath flowers in winter spread !
Parsing [sent. 1744 len. 20]: Though withered -- blessed grass , that hath the grace To deck and be a carpet to that place !
Parsing [sent. 1745 len. 30]: Thus sang , unto the sounds of oaten reed , Before the babe , the shepherds bowed on knees ; And springs ran nectar , honey dropped from trees .
Parsing [sent. 1746 len. 12]: No doubt there is a touch of the conventional in these .
Parsing [sent. 1747 len. 22]: Especially in the close of the last there is an attempt to glorify the true by the homage of the false .
Parsing [sent. 1748 len. 37]: But verses which make us feel the marvel afresh -- the marvel visible and credible by the depth of its heart of glory -- make us at the same time easily forget the discord in themselves .
Parsing [sent. 1749 len. 37]: The following , not a sonnet , although it looks like one , measuring the lawful fourteen lines , is the closing paragraph of a poem he calls _ A Hymn to the Fairest Fair _ .
Parsing [sent. 1750 len. 17]: O king , whose greatness none can comprehend , Whose boundless goodness doth to all extend !
Parsing [sent. 1751 len. 5]: Light of all beauty !
Parsing [sent. 1752 len. 12]: ocean without ground , That standing flowest , giving dost abound !
Parsing [sent. 1753 len. 17]: Rich palace , and indweller ever blest , Never not working , ever yet in rest !
Parsing [sent. 1754 len. 79]: What wit can not conceive , words say of thee , Here , where , as in a mirror , we but see Shadows of shadows , atoms of thy might , Still owly-eyed while staring on thy light , Grant that , released from this earthly jail , And freed of clouds which here our knowledge veil , In heaven 's high temples , where thy praises ring , I may in sweeter notes hear angels sing .
Parsing [sent. 1755 len. 19]: That is , `` May I in heaven hear angels sing what wit can not conceive here . ''
Parsing [sent. 1756 len. 26]: Drummond excels in nobility of speech , and especially in the fine line and phrase , so justly but disproportionately prized in the present day .
Parsing [sent. 1757 len. 37]: I give an instance of each : Here do seraphim Burn with immortal love ; there cherubim _ With other noble people of the light _ , As eaglets in the sun , delight their sight .
Parsing [sent. 1758 len. 34]: * * * * * Like to a lightning through the welkin hurled , _ That scores with flames the way _ , and every eye With terror dazzles as it swimmeth by .
Parsing [sent. 1759 len. 20]: Here are six fine verses , in the heroic couplet , from _ An Hymn of the Resurrection _ .
Parsing [sent. 1760 len. 57]: So a small seed that in the earth lies hid And dies -- reviving bursts her cloddy side ; Adorned with yellow locks , of new is born , And doth become a mother great with corn ; Of grains bring hundreds with it , which when old Enrich the furrows with a sea of gold .
Parsing [sent. 1761 len. 19]: But I must content myself now with a little madrigal , the only one fit for my purpose .
Parsing [sent. 1762 len. 20]: Those which would best support what I have said of his music are not of the kind we want .
Parsing [sent. 1763 len. 14]: Unfortunately , the end of this one is not equal to the beginning .
Parsing [sent. 1764 len. 5]: CHANGE SHOULD BREED CHANGE .
Parsing [sent. 1765 len. 22]: New doth the sun appear ; The mountains ' snows decay ; Crowned with frail flowers comes forth the baby year .
Parsing [sent. 1766 len. 31]: My soul , time posts away ; And thou yet in that frost , Which flower and fruit hath lost , As if all here immortal were , dost stay !
Parsing [sent. 1767 len. 3]: For shame !
Parsing [sent. 1768 len. 36]: thy powers awake ; Look to that heaven which never night makes black ; And there , at that immortal sun 's bright rays , Deck thee with flowers which fear not rage of days .
Parsing [sent. 1769 len. 3]: CHAPTER XI .
Parsing [sent. 1770 len. 4]: THE BROTHERS FLETCHER .
Parsing [sent. 1771 len. 62]: I now come to make mention of two gifted brothers , Giles and Phineas Fletcher , both clergymen , the sons of a clergyman and nephews to the Bishop of Bristol , therefore the cousins of Fletcher the dramatist , a poem by whom I have already given Giles , the eldest , is supposed to have been born in 1588 .
Parsing [sent. 1772 len. 16]: From his poem _ Christ 's Victory and Triumph _ , I select three passages .
Parsing [sent. 1773 len. 37]: To understand the first , it is necessary to explain that while Christ is on earth a dispute between Justice and Mercy , such as is often represented by the theologians , takes place in heaven .
Parsing [sent. 1774 len. 28]: We must allow the unsuitable fiction attributing distraction to the divine Unity , for the sake of the words in which Mercy overthrows the arguments of Justice .
Parsing [sent. 1775 len. 16]: For the poet unintentionally nullifies the symbolism of the theologian , representing Justice as defeated .
Parsing [sent. 1776 len. 11]: He forgets that the grandest exercise of justice is mercy .
Parsing [sent. 1777 len. 26]: The confusion comes from the fancy that justice means _ vengeance upon sin _ , and not _ the doing of what is right _ .
Parsing [sent. 1778 len. 21]: Justice can be at no strife with mercy , for not to do what is just would be most unmerciful .
Parsing [sent. 1779 len. 30]: Mercy first sums up the arguments Justice has been employing against her , in the following stanza : He was but dust ; why feared he not to fall ?
Parsing [sent. 1780 len. 10]: And being fallen how can he hope to live ?
Parsing [sent. 1781 len. 10]: Can not the hand destroy him that made all ?
Parsing [sent. 1782 len. 10]: Could he not take away as well as give ?
Parsing [sent. 1783 len. 10]: Should man deprave , and should not God deprive ?
Parsing [sent. 1784 len. 33]: Was it not all the world 's deceiving spirit -LRB- That , bladdered up with pride of his own merit , Fell in his rise -RRB- that him of heaven did disinherit ?
Parsing [sent. 1785 len. 21]: To these she then proceeds to make reply : He was but dust : how could he stand before him ?
Parsing [sent. 1786 len. 11]: And being fallen , why should he fear to die ?
Parsing [sent. 1787 len. 12]: Can not the hand that made him first , restore him ?
Parsing [sent. 1788 len. 11]: Depraved of sin , should he deprivéd lie Of grace ?
Parsing [sent. 1789 len. 10]: Can he not find infirmity That gave him strength ?
Parsing [sent. 1790 len. 24]: -- Unworthy the forsaking He is , whoever weighs -LRB- without mistaking -RRB- Or maker of the man or manner of his making .
Parsing [sent. 1791 len. 28]: -LSB- 89 -RSB- Who shall thy temple incense any more , Or to thy altar crown the sacrifice , Or strew with idle flowers the hallowed floor ?
Parsing [sent. 1792 len. 13]: Or what should prayer deck with herbs and spice , _ why .
Parsing [sent. 1793 len. 19]: _ Her vials breathing orisons of price , If all must pay that which all can not pay ?
Parsing [sent. 1794 len. 22]: O first begin with me , and Mercy slay , And thy thrice honoured Son , that now beneath doth stray .
Parsing [sent. 1795 len. 23]: But if or he or I may live and speak , And heaven can joy to see a sinner weep , Oh !
Parsing [sent. 1796 len. 28]: let not Justice ' iron sceptre break A heart already broke , that low doth creep , And with prone humbless her feet 's dust doth sweep .
Parsing [sent. 1797 len. 6]: Must all go by desert ?
Parsing [sent. 1798 len. 4]: Is nothing free ?
Parsing [sent. 1799 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 1800 len. 14]: if but those that only worthy be , None should thee ever see !
Parsing [sent. 1801 len. 6]: none should thee ever see !
Parsing [sent. 1802 len. 19]: What hath man done that man shall not undo Since God to him is grown so near akin ?
Parsing [sent. 1803 len. 6]: Did his foe slay him ?
Parsing [sent. 1804 len. 6]: He shall slay his foe .
Parsing [sent. 1805 len. 5]: Hath he lost all ?
Parsing [sent. 1806 len. 6]: He all again shall win .
Parsing [sent. 1807 len. 5]: Is sin his master ?
Parsing [sent. 1808 len. 5]: He shall master sin .
Parsing [sent. 1809 len. 11]: Too hardy soul , with sin the field to try !
Parsing [sent. 1810 len. 24]: The only way to conquer was to fly ; But thus long death hath lived , and now death 's self shall die .
Parsing [sent. 1811 len. 51]: He is a path , if any be misled ; He is a robe , if any naked be ; If any chance to hunger , he is bread ; If any be a bondman , he is free ; If any be but weak , how strong is he !
Parsing [sent. 1812 len. 33]: To dead men life he is , to sick men health , To blind men sight , and to the needy wealth ; A pleasure without loss , a treasure without stealth .
Parsing [sent. 1813 len. 44]: Who can forget -- never to be forgot -- The time that all the world in slumber lies , When like the stars the singing angels shot To earth , and heaven awakéd all his eyes To see another sun at midnight rise ?
Parsing [sent. 1814 len. 14]: On earth was never sight of peril fame ; _ pareil : equal .
Parsing [sent. 1815 len. 20]: _ For God before man like himself did frame , But God himself now like a mortal man became .
Parsing [sent. 1816 len. 81]: * * * * * The angels carolled loud their song of peace ; The cursed oracles were stricken dumb ; To see their Shepherd the poor shepherds press ; To see their King , the kingly Sophies come ; And them to guide unto his master 's home , A star comes dancing up the orient , That springs for joy over the strawy tent , Where gold , to make their prince a crown , they all present .
Parsing [sent. 1817 len. 61]: No doubt there are here touches of execrable taste , such as the punning trick with _ man _ and _ manners _ , suggesting a false antithesis ; or the opposition of the words _ deprave _ and _ deprive _ ; but we have in them only an instance of how the meretricious may co-exist with the lovely .
Parsing [sent. 1818 len. 13]: The passage is fine and powerful , notwithstanding its faults and obscurities .
Parsing [sent. 1819 len. 52]: Here is another yet more beautiful : So down the silver streams of Eridan , -LSB- 90 -RSB- On either side banked with a lily wall , Whiter than both , rides the triumphant swan , And sings his dirge , and prophesies his fall , Diving into his watery funeral !
Parsing [sent. 1820 len. 28]: But Eridan to Cedron must submit His flowery shore ; nor can he envy it , If , when Apollo sings , his swans do silent sit .
Parsing [sent. 1821 len. 54]: -LSB- 91 -RSB- That heavenly voice I more delight to hear Than gentle airs to breathe ; or swelling waves Against the sounding rocks their bosoms tear ; -LSB- 92 -RSB- Or whistling reeds that rutty -LSB- 93 -RSB- Jordan laves , And with their verdure his white head embraves ; _ adorns .
Parsing [sent. 1822 len. 36]: _ To chide the winds ; or hiving bees that fly About the laughing blossoms -LSB- 94 -RSB- of sallowy , -LSB- 95 -RSB- Rocking asleep the idle grooms -LSB- 96 -RSB- that lazy lie .
Parsing [sent. 1823 len. 21]: And yet how can I hear thee singing go , When men , incensed with hate , thy death foreset ?
Parsing [sent. 1824 len. 38]: Or else , why do I hear thee sighing so , When thou , inflamed with love , their life dost get , -LSB- 97 -RSB- That love and hate , and sighs and songs are met ?
Parsing [sent. 1825 len. 37]: But thus , and only thus , thy love did crave To send thee singing for us to thy grave , While we sought thee to kill , and thou sought ` st us to save .
Parsing [sent. 1826 len. 88]: When I remember Christ our burden bears , I look for glory , but find misery ; I look for joy , but find a sea of tears ; I look that we should live , and find him die ; I look for angels ' songs , and hear him cry : Thus what I look , I can not find so well ; Or rather , what I find I can not tell , These banks so narrow are , those streams so highly swell .
Parsing [sent. 1827 len. 21]: We would gladly eliminate the few common-place allusions ; but we must take them with the rest of the passage .
Parsing [sent. 1828 len. 13]: Besides far higher merits , it is to my ear most melodious .
Parsing [sent. 1829 len. 29]: One more passage of two stanzas from Giles Fletcher , concerning the glories of heaven : I quote them for the sake of earth , not of heaven .
Parsing [sent. 1830 len. 74]: Gaze but upon the house where man embowers : With flowers and rushes pavéd is his way ; Where all the creatures are his servitours : The winds do sweep his chambers every day , And clouds do wash his rooms ; the ceiling gay , Starréd aloft , the gilded knobs embrave : If such a house God to another gave , How shine those glittering courts he for himself will have !
Parsing [sent. 1831 len. 68]: And if a sullen cloud , as sad as night , In which the sun may seem embodiéd , Depured of all his dross , we see so white , Burning in melted gold his watery head , Or round with ivory edges silvered ; What lustre super-excellent will he Lighten on those that shall his sunshine see In that all-glorious court in which all glories be !
Parsing [sent. 1832 len. 8]: These brothers were intense admirers of Spenser .
Parsing [sent. 1833 len. 15]: To be like him Phineas must write an allegory ; and such an allegory !
Parsing [sent. 1834 len. 14]: Of all the strange poems in existence , surely this is the strangest .
Parsing [sent. 1835 len. 38]: The _ Purple Island _ is man , whose body is anatomically described after the allegory of a city , which is then peopled with all the human faculties personified , each set in motion by itself .
Parsing [sent. 1836 len. 13]: They say the anatomy is correct : the metaphysics are certainly good .
Parsing [sent. 1837 len. 34]: The action of the poem is just another form of the _ Holy War _ of John Bunyan -- all the good and bad powers fighting for the possession of the Purple Island .
Parsing [sent. 1838 len. 74]: What renders the conception yet more amazing is the fact that the whole ponderous mass of anatomy and metaphysics , nearly as long as the _ Paradise Lost _ , is put as a song , in a succession of twelve cantos , in the mouth of a shepherd , who begins a canto every morning to the shepherds and shepherdesses of the neighbourhood , and finishes it by folding-time in the evening .
Parsing [sent. 1839 len. 9]: And yet the poem is full of poetry .
Parsing [sent. 1840 len. 20]: He triumphs over his difficulties partly by audacity , partly by seriousness , partly by the enchantment of song .
Parsing [sent. 1841 len. 15]: But the poem will never be read through except by students of English literature .
Parsing [sent. 1842 len. 34]: It is a whole ; its members are well-fitted ; it is full of beauties -- in parts they swarm like fire-flies ; and _ yet _ it is not a good poem .
Parsing [sent. 1843 len. 18]: It is like a well-shaped house , built of mud , and stuck full of precious stones .
Parsing [sent. 1844 len. 15]: I do not care , in my limited space , to quote from it .
Parsing [sent. 1845 len. 10]: Never was there a more incongruous dragon of allegory .
Parsing [sent. 1846 len. 22]: Both brothers were injured , not by their worship of Spenser , but by the form that worship took -- imitation .
Parsing [sent. 1847 len. 30]: They seem more pleased to produce a line or stanza that shall recall a line or stanza of Spenser , than to produce a fine original of their own .
Parsing [sent. 1848 len. 13]: They even copy lines almost word for word from their great master .
Parsing [sent. 1849 len. 52]: This is pure homage : it was their delight that such adaptations should be recognized -- just as it was Spenser 's hope , when he inserted translated stanzas from Tasso 's _ Jerusalem Delivered _ in _ The Fairy Queen _ , to gain the honour of a true reproduction .
Parsing [sent. 1850 len. 7]: Yet , strange fate for imitators !
Parsing [sent. 1851 len. 19]: both , but Giles especially , were imitated by a greater than their worship -- even by Milton .
Parsing [sent. 1852 len. 11]: They make Spenser 's worse ; Milton makes theirs better .
Parsing [sent. 1853 len. 13]: They imitate Spenser , faults and all ; Milton glorifies their beauties .
Parsing [sent. 1854 len. 16]: From the smaller poems of Phineas , I choose the following version of PSALM CXXX .
Parsing [sent. 1855 len. 32]: From the deeps of grief and fear , O Lord , to thee my soul repairs : From thy heaven bow down thine ear ; Let thy mercy meet my prayers .
Parsing [sent. 1856 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 1857 len. 19]: if thou mark ` st what 's done amiss , What soul so pure can see thy bliss ?
Parsing [sent. 1858 len. 13]: But with thee sweet Mercy stands , Sealing pardons , working fear .
Parsing [sent. 1859 len. 17]: Wait , my soul , wait on his hands ; Wait , mine eye ; oh !
Parsing [sent. 1860 len. 23]: wait , mine ear : If he his eye or tongue affords , Watch all his looks , catch all his words .
Parsing [sent. 1861 len. 53]: As a watchman waits for day , And looks for light , and looks again : When the night grows old and gray , To be relieved he calls amain : So look , so wait , so long , mine eyes , To see my Lord , my sun , arise .
Parsing [sent. 1862 len. 49]: Wait , ye saints , wait on our Lord , For from his tongue sweet mercy flows ; Wait on his cross , wait on his word ; Upon that tree redemption grows : He will redeem his Israel From sin and wrath , from death and hell .
Parsing [sent. 1863 len. 14]: I shall now give two stanzas of his version of the 127th Psalm .
Parsing [sent. 1864 len. 24]: If God build not the house , and lay The groundwork sure -- whoever build , It can not stand one stormy day .
Parsing [sent. 1865 len. 28]: If God be not the city 's shield , If he be not their bars and wall , In vain is watch-tower , men , and all .
Parsing [sent. 1866 len. 53]: Though then thou wak ` st when others rest , Though rising thou prevent ` st the sun , Though with lean care thou daily feast , Thy labour 's lost , and thou undone ; But God his child will feed and keep , And draw the curtains to his sleep .
Parsing [sent. 1867 len. 30]: Compare this with a version of the same portion by Dr. Henry King , Bishop of Chichester , who , no great poet , has written some good verse .
Parsing [sent. 1868 len. 10]: He was about the same age as Phineas Fletcher .
Parsing [sent. 1869 len. 41]: Except the Lord the house sustain , The builder 's labour is in vain ; Except the city he defend , And to the dwellers safety send , In vain are sentinels prepared , Or arméd watchmen for the guard .
Parsing [sent. 1870 len. 44]: You vainly with the early light Arise , or sit up late at night To find support , and daily eat Your bread with sorrow earned and sweat ; When God , who his beloved keeps , This plenty gives with quiet sleeps .
Parsing [sent. 1871 len. 6]: What difference do we find ?
Parsing [sent. 1872 len. 15]: That the former has the more poetic touch , the latter the greater truth .
Parsing [sent. 1873 len. 41]: The former has just lost the one precious thing in the psalm ; the latter has kept it : that care is as useless as painful , for God gives us while we sleep , and not while we labour .
Parsing [sent. 1874 len. 3]: CHAPTER XII .
Parsing [sent. 1875 len. 7]: WITHER , HERRICK , AND QUARLES .
Parsing [sent. 1876 len. 25]: George Wither , born in 1588 , therefore about the same age as Giles Fletcher , was a very different sort of writer indeed .
Parsing [sent. 1877 len. 8]: There could hardly be a greater contrast .
Parsing [sent. 1878 len. 22]: Fancy , and all her motley train , were scarcely known to Wither , save by the hearing of the ears .
Parsing [sent. 1879 len. 24]: He became an eager Puritan towards the close of his life , but his poetry chiefly belongs to the earlier part of it .
Parsing [sent. 1880 len. 17]: Throughout it is distinguished by a certain straightforward simplicity of good English thought and English word .
Parsing [sent. 1881 len. 15]: His hymns remind me , in the form of their speech , of Gascoigne .
Parsing [sent. 1882 len. 53]: I shall quote but little ; for , although there is a sweet calm and a great justice of reflection and feeling , there is hardly anything of that warming glow , that rousing force , that impressive weight in his verse , which is the chief virtue of the lofty rhyme .
Parsing [sent. 1883 len. 38]: The best in a volume of ninety _ Hymns and Songs of the Church _ , is , I think , _ The Author 's Hymn _ at the close , of which I give three stanzas .
Parsing [sent. 1884 len. 23]: They manifest the simplicity and truth of the man , reflecting in their very tone his faithful , contented , trustful nature .
Parsing [sent. 1885 len. 44]: By thy grace , those passions , troubles , And those wants that me opprest , Have appeared as water-bubbles , Or as dreams , and things in jest : For , thy leisure still attending , I with pleasure saw their ending .
Parsing [sent. 1886 len. 40]: Those afflictions and those terrors , Which to others grim appear , Did but show me where my errors And my imperfections were ; But distrustful could not make me Of thy love , nor fright nor shake me .
Parsing [sent. 1887 len. 46]: Those base hopes that would possess me , And those thoughts of vain repute Which do now and then oppress me , Do not , Lord , to me impute ; And though part they will not from me , Let them never overcome me .
Parsing [sent. 1888 len. 18]: He has written another similar volume , but much larger , and of a somewhat extraordinary character .
Parsing [sent. 1889 len. 55]: It consists of no fewer than two hundred and thirty-three hymns , mostly long , upon an incredible variety of subjects , comprehending one for every season of nature and of the church , and one for every occurrence in life of which the author could think as likely to confront man or woman .
Parsing [sent. 1890 len. 113]: Of these subjects I quote a few of the more remarkable , but even from them my reader can have little conception of the variety in the book : _ A Hymn whilst we are washing _ ; _ In a clear starry Night _ ; _ A Hymn for a House-warming _ ; _ After a great Frost or Snow _ ; _ For one whose Beauty is much praised _ ; _ For one upbraided with Deformity _ ; _ For a Widower or a Widow delivered from a troublesome Yokefellow _ ; _ For a Cripple _ ; _ For a Jailor _ ; _ For a Poet _ .
Parsing [sent. 1891 len. 18]: Here is a portion of one which I hope may be helpful to some of my readers .
Parsing [sent. 1892 len. 6]: WHEN WE CAN NOT SLEEP .
Parsing [sent. 1893 len. 26]: What ails my heart , that in my breast It thus unquiet lies ; And that it now of needful rest Deprives my tiréd eyes ?
Parsing [sent. 1894 len. 31]: Let not vain hopes , griefs , doubts , or fears , Distemper so my mind ; But cast on God thy thoughtful cares , And comfort thou shalt find .
Parsing [sent. 1895 len. 26]: In vain that soul attempteth ought , And spends her thoughts in vain , Who by or in herself hath sought Desiréd peace to gain .
Parsing [sent. 1896 len. 27]: On thee , O Lord , on thee therefore , My musings now I place ; Thy free remission I implore , And thy refreshing grace .
Parsing [sent. 1897 len. 27]: Forgive thou me , that when my mind Oppressed began to be , I sought elsewhere my peace to find , Before I came to thee .
Parsing [sent. 1898 len. 29]: And , gracious God , vouchsafe to grant , Unworthy though I am , The needful rest which now I want , That I may praise thy name .
Parsing [sent. 1899 len. 22]: Before examining the volume , one would say that no man could write so many hymns without frequent and signal failure .
Parsing [sent. 1900 len. 17]: But the marvel here is , that the hymns are all so very far from bad .
Parsing [sent. 1901 len. 12]: He can never have written in other than a gentle mood .
Parsing [sent. 1902 len. 21]: There must have been a fine harmony in his nature , that _ kept _ him , as it were .
Parsing [sent. 1903 len. 12]: This peacefulness makes him interesting in spite of his comparative flatness .
Parsing [sent. 1904 len. 20]: I must restrain remark , however , and give five out of twelve stanzas of another of his hymns .
Parsing [sent. 1905 len. 4]: A ROCKING HYMN .
Parsing [sent. 1906 len. 10]: Sweet baby , sleep ; what ails my dear ?
Parsing [sent. 1907 len. 8]: What ails my darling thus to cry ?
Parsing [sent. 1908 len. 17]: Be still , my child , and lend thine ear To hear me sing thy lullaby .
Parsing [sent. 1909 len. 19]: My pretty lamb , forbear to weep ; Be still , my dear ; sweet baby , sleep .
Parsing [sent. 1910 len. 29]: Whilst thus thy lullaby I sing , For thee great blessings ripening be ; Thine eldest brother is a king , And hath a kingdom bought for thee .
Parsing [sent. 1911 len. 19]: Sweet baby , then forbear to weep ; Be still , my babe ; sweet baby , sleep .
Parsing [sent. 1912 len. 29]: A little infant once was he , And strength in weakness then was laid Upon his virgin mother 's knee , That power to thee might be conveyed .
Parsing [sent. 1913 len. 19]: Sweet baby , then forbear to weep ; Be still , my babe ; sweet baby , sleep .
Parsing [sent. 1914 len. 30]: Within a manger lodged thy Lord , Where oxen lay , and asses fed ; Warm rooms we do to thee afford , An easy cradle or a bed .
Parsing [sent. 1915 len. 19]: Sweet baby , then forbear to weep ; Be still , my babe ; sweet baby , sleep .
Parsing [sent. 1916 len. 33]: Thou hast , yet more to perfect this , A promise and an earnest got , Of gaining everlasting bliss , Though thou , my babe , perceiv ` st it not .
Parsing [sent. 1917 len. 19]: Sweet baby , then forbear to weep ; Be still , my babe ; sweet baby , sleep .
Parsing [sent. 1918 len. 24]: I think George Wither 's verses will grow upon the reader of them , tame as they are sure to appear at first .
Parsing [sent. 1919 len. 30]: His _ Hallelujah , or Britain 's Second Remembrancer _ , from which I have been quoting , is well worth possessing , and can be procured without difficulty .
Parsing [sent. 1920 len. 18]: We now come to a new sort , both of man and poet -- still a clergyman .
Parsing [sent. 1921 len. 62]: It is an especial pleasure to write the name of Robert Herrick amongst the poets of religion , for the very act records that the jolly , careless Anacreon of the church , with his head and heart crowded with pleasures , threw down at length his wine-cup , tore the roses from his head , and knelt in the dust .
Parsing [sent. 1922 len. 46]: Nothing bears Herrick 's name so unrefined as the things Dr. Donne wrote in his youth ; but the impression made by his earlier poems is of a man of far shallower nature , and greatly more absorbed in the delights of the passing hour .
Parsing [sent. 1923 len. 59]: In the year 1648 , when he was fifty-seven years of age , being prominent as a Royalist , he was ejected from his living by the dominant Puritans ; and in that same year he published his poems , of which the latter part and later written is his _ Noble Numbers _ , or religious poems .
Parsing [sent. 1924 len. 64]: We may wonder at his publishing the _ Hesperides _ along with them , but we must not forget that , while the manners of a time are never to be taken as a justification of what is wrong , the judgment of men concerning what is wrong will be greatly influenced by those manners -- not necessarily on the side of laxity .
Parsing [sent. 1925 len. 53]: It is but fair to receive his own testimony concerning himself , offered in these two lines printed at the close of his _ Hesperides _ : To his book 's end this last line he 'd have placed : _ Jocund his muse was , but his life was chaste _ .
Parsing [sent. 1926 len. 24]: We find the same artist in the _ Noble Numbers _ as in the _ Hesperides _ , but hardly the same man .
Parsing [sent. 1927 len. 66]: However far he may have been from the model of a clergyman in the earlier period of his history , partly no doubt from the society to which his power of song made him acceptable , I can not believe that these later poems are the results of mood , still less the results of mere professional bias , or even sense of professional duty .
Parsing [sent. 1928 len. 37]: In a good many of his poems he touches the heart of truth ; in others , even those of epigrammatic form , he must be allowed to fail in point as well as in meaning .
Parsing [sent. 1929 len. 30]: As to his art-forms , he is guilty of great offences , the result of the same passion for lawless figures and similitudes which Dr. Donne so freely indulged .
Parsing [sent. 1930 len. 37]: But his verses are brightened by a certain almost childishly quaint and innocent humour ; while the tenderness of some of them rises on the reader like the aurora of the coming sun of George Herbert .
Parsing [sent. 1931 len. 42]: I do not forget that , even if some of his poems were printed in 1639 , years before that George Herbert had done his work and gone home : my figure stands in relation to the order I have adopted .
Parsing [sent. 1932 len. 13]: Some of his verse is homelier than even George Herbert 's homeliest .
Parsing [sent. 1933 len. 28]: One of its most remarkable traits is a quaint thanksgiving for the commonest things by name -- not the less real that it is sometimes even queer .
Parsing [sent. 1934 len. 67]: For instance : God gives not only corn for need , But likewise superabundant seed ; Bread for our service , bread for show ; Meat for our meals , and fragments too : He gives not poorly , taking some Between the finger and the thumb , But for our glut , and for our store , Fine flour pressed down , and running o'er .
Parsing [sent. 1935 len. 9]: Here is another , delightful in its oddity .
Parsing [sent. 1936 len. 22]: We can fancy the merry yet gracious poet chuckling over the vision of the child and the fancy of his words .
Parsing [sent. 1937 len. 6]: A GRACE FOR A CHILD .
Parsing [sent. 1938 len. 23]: Here a little child I stand , Heaving up my either hand ; Cold as paddocks though they be , _ frogs .
Parsing [sent. 1939 len. 23]: _ Here I lift them up to thee , For a benison to fall On our meat , and on us all .
Parsing [sent. 1940 len. 4]: _ Amen _ .
Parsing [sent. 1941 len. 26]: I shall now give two or three of his longer poems , which are not long , and then a few of his short ones .
Parsing [sent. 1942 len. 21]: The best known is the following , but it is not so well known that I must therefore omit it .
Parsing [sent. 1943 len. 7]: HIS LITANY TO THE HOLY SPIRIT .
Parsing [sent. 1944 len. 25]: In the hour of my distress , When temptations me oppress , And when I my sins confess , Sweet Spirit , comfort me .
Parsing [sent. 1945 len. 27]: When I lie within my bed , Sick in heart , and sick in head , And with doubts discomforted , Sweet Spirit , comfort me .
Parsing [sent. 1946 len. 30]: When the house doth sigh and weep , And the world is drowned in sleep , Yet mine eyes the watch do keep , Sweet Spirit , comfort me .
Parsing [sent. 1947 len. 9]: When the artless doctor sees _ without skill .
Parsing [sent. 1948 len. 24]: _ No one hope , but of his fees , And his skill runs on the lees , Sweet Spirit , comfort me .
Parsing [sent. 1949 len. 27]: When his potion and his pill , His or none or little skill , Meet for nothing but to kill , Sweet Spirit , comfort me .
Parsing [sent. 1950 len. 25]: When the passing-bell doth toll , And the furies in a shoal Come to fright a parting soul , Sweet Spirit , comfort me .
Parsing [sent. 1951 len. 26]: When the tapers now burn blue , And the comforters are few , And that number more than true , Sweet Spirit , comfort me .
Parsing [sent. 1952 len. 29]: When the priest his last hath prayed , And I nod to what is said , 'Cause my speech is now decayed , Sweet Spirit , comfort me .
Parsing [sent. 1953 len. 28]: When God knows I 'm tossed about , Either with despair or doubt , Yet , before the glass be out , Sweet Spirit , comfort me .
Parsing [sent. 1954 len. 28]: When the tempter me pursu ` th With the sins of all my youth , And half damns me with untruth , Sweet Spirit , comfort me .
Parsing [sent. 1955 len. 26]: When the flames and hellish cries Fright mine ears and fright mine eyes , And all terrors me surprise , Sweet Spirit , comfort me .
Parsing [sent. 1956 len. 26]: When the judgment is revealed , And that opened which was sealed ; When to thee I have appealed , Sweet Spirit , comfort me .
Parsing [sent. 1957 len. 10]: THE WHITE ISLAND , OR PLACE OF THE BLEST .
Parsing [sent. 1958 len. 86]: In this world , the Isle of Dreams , While we sit by sorrow 's streams , Tears and terrors are our themes , Reciting ; But when once from hence we fly , More and more approaching nigh Unto young eternity , Uniting ; In that whiter island , where Things are evermore sincere ; Candour here and lustre there , Delighting : There no monstrous fancies shall Out of hell an horror call , To create , or cause at all , Affrighting .
Parsing [sent. 1959 len. 41]: There , in calm and cooling sleep We our eyes shall never steep , But eternal watch shall keep , Attending Pleasures such as shall pursue Me immortalized and you ; And fresh joys , as never too Have ending .
Parsing [sent. 1960 len. 3]: TO DEATH .
Parsing [sent. 1961 len. 98]: Thou bid ` st me come away ; And I 'll no longer stay Than for to shed some tears For faults of former years ; And to repent some crimes Done in the present times ; And next , to take a bit Of bread , and wine with it ; To don my robes of love , Fit for the place above ; To gird my loins about With charity throughout , And so to travel hence With feet of innocence : These done , I 'll only cry , `` God , mercy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1962 len. 4]: and so die .
Parsing [sent. 1963 len. 2]: ETERNITY .
Parsing [sent. 1964 len. 7]: O years and age , farewell !
Parsing [sent. 1965 len. 11]: Behold I go Where I do know Infinity to dwell .
Parsing [sent. 1966 len. 42]: And these mine eyes shall see All times , how they Are lost i ' th ' sea Of vast eternity , Where never moon shall sway The stars ; but she And night shall be Drowned in one endless day .
Parsing [sent. 1967 len. 6]: THE GOODNESS OF HIS GOD .
Parsing [sent. 1968 len. 26]: When winds and seas do rage , And threaten to undo me , Thou dost their wrath assuage , If I but call unto thee .
Parsing [sent. 1969 len. 24]: A mighty storm last night Did seek my soul to swallow ; But by the peep of light A gentle calm did follow .
Parsing [sent. 1970 len. 23]: What need I then despair Though ills stand round about me ; Since mischiefs neither dare To bark or bite without thee ?
Parsing [sent. 1971 len. 3]: TO GOD .
Parsing [sent. 1972 len. 34]: Lord , I am like to mistletoe , Which has no root , and can not grow Or prosper , but by that same tree It clings about : so I by thee .
Parsing [sent. 1973 len. 16]: What need I then to fear at all So long as I about thee crawl ?
Parsing [sent. 1974 len. 18]: But if that tree should fall and die , Tumble shall heaven , and down will I .
Parsing [sent. 1975 len. 23]: Here are now a few chosen from many that -- to borrow a term from Crashaw -- might be called DIVINE EPIGRAMS .
Parsing [sent. 1976 len. 38]: God , when he 's angry here with any one , His wrath is free from perturbation ; And when we think his looks are sour and grim , The alteration is in us , not him .
Parsing [sent. 1977 len. 43]: * * * * * God ca n't be wrathful ; but we may conclude Wrathful he may be by similitude : God 's wrathful said to be when he doth do That without wrath , which wrath doth force us to .
Parsing [sent. 1978 len. 25]: * * * * * 'T is hard to find God ; but to comprehend Him as he is , is labour without end .
Parsing [sent. 1979 len. 26]: * * * * * God 's rod doth watch while men do sleep , and then The rod doth sleep while vigilant are men .
Parsing [sent. 1980 len. 23]: * * * * * A man 's trangression God does then remit , When man he makes a penitent for it .
Parsing [sent. 1981 len. 45]: * * * * * God , when he takes my goods and chattels hence , Gives me a portion , giving patience : What is in God is God : if so it be He patience gives , he gives himself to me .
Parsing [sent. 1982 len. 28]: * * * * * Humble we must be , if to heaven we go ; High is the roof there , but the gate is low .
Parsing [sent. 1983 len. 27]: * * * * * God who 's in heaven , will hear from thence , If not to the sound , yet to the sense .
Parsing [sent. 1984 len. 20]: * * * * * The same who crowns the conqueror , will be A coadjutor in the agony .
Parsing [sent. 1985 len. 17]: * * * * * God is so potent , as his power can _ that .
Parsing [sent. 1986 len. 11]: _ Draw out of bad a sovereign good to man .
Parsing [sent. 1987 len. 26]: * * * * * Paradise is , as from the learn 'd I gather , A choir of blest souls circling in the Father .
Parsing [sent. 1988 len. 23]: * * * * * Heaven is not given for our good works here ; Yet it is given to the labourer .
Parsing [sent. 1989 len. 32]: * * * * * One more for the sake of Martha , smiled at by so many because they are incapable either of her blame or her sister 's praise .
Parsing [sent. 1990 len. 16]: The repetition of the name , made known No other than Christ 's full affection .
Parsing [sent. 1991 len. 10]: And so farewell to the very lovable Robert Herrick .
Parsing [sent. 1992 len. 7]: Francis Quarles was born in 1592 .
Parsing [sent. 1993 len. 41]: I have not much to say about him , popular as he was in his own day , for a large portion of his writing takes the shape of satire , which I consider only an active form of negation .
Parsing [sent. 1994 len. 14]: I doubt much if mere opposition to the false is of any benefit .
Parsing [sent. 1995 len. 52]: Convince a man by argument that the thing he has been taught is false , and you leave his house empty , swept , and garnished ; but the expulsion of the falsehood is no protection against its re-entrance in another mask , with seven worse than itself in its company .
Parsing [sent. 1996 len. 42]: The right effort of the teacher is to give the positive -- to present , as he may , the vision of reality , for the perception of which , and not for the discovery of falsehood , is man created .
Parsing [sent. 1997 len. 21]: This will not only cast out the demon , but so people the house that he will not dare return .
Parsing [sent. 1998 len. 27]: If a man might disprove all the untruths in creation , he would hardly be a hair 's breadth nearer the end of his own making .
Parsing [sent. 1999 len. 51]: It is better to hold honestly one fragment of truth in the midst of immeasurable error , than to sit alone , if that were possible , in the midst of an absolute vision , clear as the hyaline , but only repellent of falsehood , not receptive of truth .
Parsing [sent. 2000 len. 11]: It is the positive by which a man shall live .
Parsing [sent. 2001 len. 5]: Truth is his life .
Parsing [sent. 2002 len. 13]: The refusal of the false is not the reception of the true .
Parsing [sent. 2003 len. 45]: A man may deny himself into a spiritual lethargy , without denying one truth , simply by spending his strength for that which is not bread , until he has none left wherewith to search for the truth , which alone can feed him .
Parsing [sent. 2004 len. 14]: Only when subjected to the positive does the negative find its true vocation .
Parsing [sent. 2005 len. 14]: I am jealous of the living force cast into the slough of satire .
Parsing [sent. 2006 len. 42]: No doubt , either indignant or loving rebuke has its end and does its work , but I fear that wit , while rousing the admiration of the spiteful or the like witty , comes in only to destroy its dignity .
Parsing [sent. 2007 len. 28]: At the same time , I am not sure whether there might not be such a judicious combination of the elements as to render my remarks inapplicable .
Parsing [sent. 2008 len. 28]: At all events , poetry favours the positive , and from the _ Emblems _ named of Quarles I shall choose one in which it fully predominates .
Parsing [sent. 2009 len. 8]: There is something in it remarkably fine .
Parsing [sent. 2010 len. 6]: PHOSPHOR , BRING THE DAY .
Parsing [sent. 2011 len. 7]: Will ' t ne'er be morning ?
Parsing [sent. 2012 len. 14]: Will that promised light Ne'er break , and clear those clouds of night ?
Parsing [sent. 2013 len. 22]: Sweet Phosphor , bring the day , Whose conquering ray May chase these fogs : sweet Phosphor , bring the day .
Parsing [sent. 2014 len. 19]: How long , how long shall these benighted eyes Languish in shades , like feeble flies Expecting spring ?
Parsing [sent. 2015 len. 19]: How long shall darkness soil The face of earth , and thus beguile Our souls of sprightful action ?
Parsing [sent. 2016 len. 28]: When , when will day Begin to dawn , whose new-born ray May gild the weathercocks of our devotion , And give our unsouled souls new motion ?
Parsing [sent. 2017 len. 22]: Sweet Phosphor , bring the day : The light will fray These horrid mists : sweet Phosphor , bring the day .
Parsing [sent. 2018 len. 33]: * * * * * Let those whose eyes , like owls , abhor the light -- Let those have night that love the night : Sweet Phosphor , bring the day .
Parsing [sent. 2019 len. 7]: How sad delay Afflicts dull hopes !
Parsing [sent. 2020 len. 7]: Sweet Phosphor , bring the day .
Parsing [sent. 2021 len. 2]: Alas !
Parsing [sent. 2022 len. 60]: my light-in-vain-expecting eyes Can find no objects but what rise From this poor mortal blaze , a dying spark Of Vulcan 's forge , whose flames are dark , -- A dangerous , dull , blue-burning light , As melancholy as the night : Here 's all the suns that glister in the sphere Of earth : Ah me !
Parsing [sent. 2023 len. 5]: what comfort 's here !
Parsing [sent. 2024 len. 7]: Sweet Phosphor , bring the day .
Parsing [sent. 2025 len. 16]: Haste , haste away Heaven 's loitering lamp : sweet Phosphor , bring the day .
Parsing [sent. 2026 len. 4]: Blow , Ignorance .
Parsing [sent. 2027 len. 49]: O thou , whose idle knee Rocks earth into a lethargy , And with thy sooty fingers hast benight The world 's fair cheeks , blow , blow thy spite ; Since thou hast puffed our greater taper , do Puff on , and out the lesser too .
Parsing [sent. 2028 len. 16]: If e'er that breath-exiled flame return , Thou hast not blown as it will burn .
Parsing [sent. 2029 len. 22]: Sweet Phosphor , bring the day : Light will repay The wrongs of night : sweet Phosphor , bring the day .
Parsing [sent. 2030 len. 39]: With honoured , thrice honoured George Herbert waiting at the door , I can not ask Francis Quarles to remain longer : I can part with him without regret , worthy man and fair poet as he is .
Parsing [sent. 2031 len. 3]: CHAPTER XIII .
Parsing [sent. 2032 len. 3]: GEORGE HERBERT .
Parsing [sent. 2033 len. 16]: But , with my hand on the lock , I shrink from opening the door .
Parsing [sent. 2034 len. 6]: Here comes a poet indeed !
Parsing [sent. 2035 len. 10]: and how am I to show him due honour ?
Parsing [sent. 2036 len. 31]: With his book humbly , doubtfully offered , with the ashes of the poems of his youth fluttering in the wind of his priestly garments , he crosses the threshold .
Parsing [sent. 2037 len. 40]: Or rather , for I had forgotten the symbol of my book , let us all go from our chapel to the choir , and humbly ask him to sing that he may make us worthy of his song .
Parsing [sent. 2038 len. 20]: In George Herbert there is poetry enough and to spare : it is the household bread of his being .
Parsing [sent. 2039 len. 37]: If I begin with that which first in the nature of things ought to be demanded of a poet , namely , Truth , Revelation -- George Herbert offers us measure pressed down and running over .
Parsing [sent. 2040 len. 24]: But let me speak first of that which first in time or order of appearance we demand of a poet , namely music .
Parsing [sent. 2041 len. 21]: For inasmuch as verse is for the ear , not for the eye , we demand a good hearing first .
Parsing [sent. 2042 len. 6]: Let no one undervalue it .
Parsing [sent. 2043 len. 25]: The heart of poetry is indeed truth , but its garments are music , and the garments come first in the process of revelation .
Parsing [sent. 2044 len. 28]: The music of a poem is its meaning in sound as distinguished from word -- its meaning in solution , as it were , uncrystallized by articulation .
Parsing [sent. 2045 len. 12]: The music goes before the fuller revelation , preparing its way .
Parsing [sent. 2046 len. 14]: The sound of a verse is the harbinger of the truth contained therein .
Parsing [sent. 2047 len. 12]: If it be a right poem , this will be true .
Parsing [sent. 2048 len. 4]: Herein Herbert excels .
Parsing [sent. 2049 len. 25]: It will be found impossible to separate the music of his words from the music of the thought which takes shape in their sound .
Parsing [sent. 2050 len. 37]: I got me flowers to strow thy way , I got me boughs off many a tree ; But thou wast up by break of day , And brought ` st thy sweets along with thee .
Parsing [sent. 2051 len. 20]: And the gift it enwraps at once and reveals is , I have said , truth of the deepest .
Parsing [sent. 2052 len. 7]: Hear this song of divine service .
Parsing [sent. 2053 len. 30]: In every song he sings a spiritual fact will be found its fundamental life , although I may quote this or that merely to illustrate some peculiarity of mode .
Parsing [sent. 2054 len. 42]: _ The Elixir _ was an imagined liquid sought by the old physical investigators , in order that by its means they might turn every common metal into gold , a pursuit not quite so absurd as it has since appeared .
Parsing [sent. 2055 len. 18]: They called this something , when regarded as a solid , _ the Philosopher 's Stone _ .
Parsing [sent. 2056 len. 12]: In the poem it is also called a _ tincture _ .
Parsing [sent. 2057 len. 3]: THE ELIXIR .
Parsing [sent. 2058 len. 55]: Teach me , my God and King , In all things thee to see ; And what I do in anything , To do it as for thee ; Not rudely , as a beast , To run into an action ; But still to make thee prepossest , And give it his perfection .
Parsing [sent. 2059 len. 3]: _ its .
Parsing [sent. 2060 len. 31]: _ A man that looks on glass , On it may stay his eye ; Or , if he pleaseth , through it pass , And then the heaven spy .
Parsing [sent. 2061 len. 26]: All may of thee partake : Nothing can be so mean , Which with his tincture -- _ for thy sake _ -- _ its .
Parsing [sent. 2062 len. 8]: _ Will not grow bright and clean .
Parsing [sent. 2063 len. 25]: A servant with this clause Makes drudgery divine : Who sweeps a room as for thy laws , Makes that and the action fine .
Parsing [sent. 2064 len. 26]: This is the famous stone That turneth all to gold ; For that which God doth touch and own Can not for less be told .
Parsing [sent. 2065 len. 32]: With a conscience tender as a child 's , almost diseased in its tenderness , and a heart loving as a woman 's , his intellect is none the less powerful .
Parsing [sent. 2066 len. 48]: Its movements are as the sword-play of an alert , poised , well-knit , strong-wristed fencer with the rapier , in which the skill impresses one more than the force , while without the force the skill would be valueless , even hurtful , to its possessor .
Parsing [sent. 2067 len. 21]: There is a graceful humour with it occasionally , even in his most serious poems adding much to their charm .
Parsing [sent. 2068 len. 19]: To illustrate all this , take the following , the title of which means _ The Retort _ .
Parsing [sent. 2069 len. 3]: THE QUIP .
Parsing [sent. 2070 len. 29]: The merry World did on a day With his train-bands and mates agree To meet together where I lay , And all in sport to jeer at me .
Parsing [sent. 2071 len. 33]: First Beauty crept into a rose ; Which when I plucked not -- `` Sir , '' said she , `` Tell me , I pray , whose hands are those ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2072 len. 14]: -LSB- 98 -RSB- _ But thou shall answer , Lord , for me .
Parsing [sent. 2073 len. 20]: _ Then Money came , and , chinking still -- `` What tune is this , poor man ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2074 len. 13]: said he : `` I heard in music you had skill . ''
Parsing [sent. 2075 len. 11]: _ But thou shall answer , Lord , for me .
Parsing [sent. 2076 len. 16]: _ Then came brave Glory puffing by In silks that whistled -- who but he ?
Parsing [sent. 2077 len. 19]: He scarce allowed me half an eye ; _ But thou shall answer , Lord , for me .
Parsing [sent. 2078 len. 35]: _ Then came quick Wit-and-Conversation , And he would needs a comfort be , And , to be short , make an oration : _ But thou shalt answer , Lord , for me .
Parsing [sent. 2079 len. 35]: _ Yet when the hour of thy design To answer these fine things , shall come , Speak not at large -- say I am thine ; And then they have their answer home .
Parsing [sent. 2080 len. 8]: Here is another instance of his humour .
Parsing [sent. 2081 len. 13]: It is the first stanza of a poem to _ Death _ .
Parsing [sent. 2082 len. 11]: He is glorying over Death as personified in a skeleton .
Parsing [sent. 2083 len. 33]: Death , thou wast once an uncouth , hideous thing -- Nothing but bones , The sad effect of sadder groans : Thy mouth was open , but thou couldst not sing .
Parsing [sent. 2084 len. 19]: No writer before him has shown such a love to God , such a childlike confidence in him .
Parsing [sent. 2085 len. 16]: The love is like the love of those whose verses came first in my volume .
Parsing [sent. 2086 len. 16]: But the nation had learned to think more , and new difficulties had consequently arisen .
Parsing [sent. 2087 len. 24]: These , again , had to be undermined by deeper thought , and the discovery of yet deeper truth had been the reward .
Parsing [sent. 2088 len. 18]: Hence , the love itself , if it had not strengthened , had at least grown deeper .
Parsing [sent. 2089 len. 66]: And George Herbert had had difficulty enough in himself ; for , born of high family , by nature fitted to shine in that society where elegance of mind , person , carriage , and utterance is most appreciated , and having indeed enjoyed something of the life of a courtier , he had forsaken all in obedience to the voice of his higher nature .
Parsing [sent. 2090 len. 44]: Hence the struggle between his tastes and his duties would come and come again , augmented probably by such austere notions as every conscientious man must entertain in proportion to his inability to find God in that in which he might find him .
Parsing [sent. 2091 len. 55]: From this inability , inseparable in its varying degrees from the very nature of growth , springs all the asceticism of good men , whose love to God will be the greater as their growing insight reveals him in his world , and their growing faith approaches to the giving of thanks in everything .
Parsing [sent. 2092 len. 40]: When we have discovered the truth that whatsoever is not of faith is sin , the way to meet it is not to forsake the human law , but so to obey it as to thank God for it .
Parsing [sent. 2093 len. 37]: To leave the world and go into the desert is not thus to give thanks : it may have been the only way for this or that man , in his blameless blindness , to take .
Parsing [sent. 2094 len. 19]: The divine mind of George Herbert , however , was in the main bent upon discovering God everywhere .
Parsing [sent. 2095 len. 21]: The poem I give next , powerfully sets forth the struggle between liking and duty of which I have spoken .
Parsing [sent. 2096 len. 32]: It is at the same time an instance of wonderful art in construction , all the force of the germinal thought kept in reserve , to burst forth at the last .
Parsing [sent. 2097 len. 18]: He calls it -- meaning by the word , _ God 's Restraint _ -- THE COLLAR .
Parsing [sent. 2098 len. 11]: I struck the board , and cried `` No more !
Parsing [sent. 2099 len. 5]: -- I will abroad .
Parsing [sent. 2100 len. 2]: What !
Parsing [sent. 2101 len. 7]: shall I ever sigh and pine ?
Parsing [sent. 2102 len. 22]: My lines and life are free -- free as the road , Loose as the wind , as large as store .
Parsing [sent. 2103 len. 7]: Shall I be still in suit ?
Parsing [sent. 2104 len. 23]: Have I no harvest but a thorn To let me blood , and not restore What I have lost with cordial fruit ?
Parsing [sent. 2105 len. 11]: Sure there was wine Before my sighs did dry it !
Parsing [sent. 2106 len. 10]: There was corn Before my tears did drown it !
Parsing [sent. 2107 len. 8]: Is the year only lost to me ?
Parsing [sent. 2108 len. 8]: Have I no bays to crown it ?
Parsing [sent. 2109 len. 7]: No flowers , no garlands gay ?
Parsing [sent. 2110 len. 3]: All blasted ?
Parsing [sent. 2111 len. 3]: All wasted ?
Parsing [sent. 2112 len. 16]: Not so , my heart ; but there is fruit , And thou hast hands .
Parsing [sent. 2113 len. 9]: Recover all thy sigh-blown age On double pleasures .
Parsing [sent. 2114 len. 12]: Leave thy cold dispute Of what is fit , and not .
Parsing [sent. 2115 len. 41]: Forsake thy cage , Thy rope of sands , Which petty thoughts have made -- and made to thee Good cable , to enforce and draw , And be thy law , While thou didst wink and wouldst not see .
Parsing [sent. 2116 len. 2]: Away !
Parsing [sent. 2117 len. 7]: Take heed -- I will abroad .
Parsing [sent. 2118 len. 9]: Call in thy death 's - head there .
Parsing [sent. 2119 len. 5]: Tie up thy fears .
Parsing [sent. 2120 len. 15]: He that forbears To suit and serve his need , Deserves his load . ''
Parsing [sent. 2121 len. 24]: But as I raved , and grew more fierce and wild At every word , Methought I heard one calling '' _ Child !
Parsing [sent. 2122 len. 11]: _ '' And I replied , '' _ My Lord !
Parsing [sent. 2123 len. 25]: _ '' Coming now to speak of his art , let me say something first about his use of homeliest imagery for highest thought .
Parsing [sent. 2124 len. 21]: This , I think , is in itself enough to class him with the highest _ kind _ of poets .
Parsing [sent. 2125 len. 53]: If my reader will refer to _ The Elixir _ , he will see an instance in the third stanza , `` You may look at the glass , or at the sky : '' `` You may regard your action only , or that action as the will of God . ''
Parsing [sent. 2126 len. 25]: Again , let him listen to the pathos and simplicity of this one stanza , from a poem he calls _ The Flower _ .
Parsing [sent. 2127 len. 30]: He has been in trouble ; his times have been evil ; he has felt a spiritual old age creeping upon him ; but he is once more awake .
Parsing [sent. 2128 len. 33]: And now in age -LSB- 99 -RSB- I bud again ; After so many deaths I live and write ; I once more smell the dew and rain , And relish versing .
Parsing [sent. 2129 len. 21]: O my only light , It can not be That I am he On whom thy tempests fell all night !
Parsing [sent. 2130 len. 19]: Again : Some may dream merrily , but when they wake They dress themselves and come to thee .
Parsing [sent. 2131 len. 9]: He has an exquisite feeling of lyrical art .
Parsing [sent. 2132 len. 20]: Not only does he keep to one idea in it , but he finishes the poem like a cameo .
Parsing [sent. 2133 len. 46]: Here is an instance wherein he outdoes the elaboration of a Norman trouvère ; for not merely does each line in each stanza end with the same sound as the corresponding line in every other stanza , but it ends with the very same word .
Parsing [sent. 2134 len. 79]: I shall hardly care to defend this if my reader chooses to call it a whim ; but I do say that a large degree of the peculiar musical effect of the poem -- subservient to the thought , keeping it dimly chiming in the head until it breaks out clear and triumphant like a silver bell in the last -- is owing to this use of the same column of words at the line-ends of every stanza .
Parsing [sent. 2135 len. 11]: Let him who doubts it , read the poem aloud .
Parsing [sent. 2136 len. 2]: AARON .
Parsing [sent. 2137 len. 34]: Holiness on the head ; Light and perfections on the breast ; Harmonious bells below , raising the dead , To lead them unto life and rest -- Thus are true Aarons drest .
Parsing [sent. 2138 len. 36]: Profaneness in my head ; Defects and darkness in my breast ; A noise of passions ringing me for dead Unto a place where is no rest -- Poor priest , thus am I drest !
Parsing [sent. 2139 len. 35]: Only another head I have , another heart and breast , Another music , making live , not dead , Without whom I could have no rest -- In him I am well drest .
Parsing [sent. 2140 len. 38]: Christ is my only head , My alone only heart and breast , My only music , striking me even dead , That to the old man I may rest , And be in him new drest .
Parsing [sent. 2141 len. 43]: So , holy in my head , Perfect and light in my dear breast , My doctrine turned by Christ , who is not dead , But lives in me while I do rest -- Come , people : Aaron 's drest .
Parsing [sent. 2142 len. 59]: Note the flow and the ebb of the lines of each stanza -- from six to eight to ten syllables , and back through eight to six , the number of stanzas corresponding to the number of lines in each ; only the poem itself begins with the ebb , and ends with a full spring-flow of energy .
Parsing [sent. 2143 len. 41]: Note also the perfect antithesis in their parts between the first and second stanzas , and how the last line of the poem clenches the whole in revealing its idea -- that for the sake of which it was written .
Parsing [sent. 2144 len. 10]: In a word , note the _ unity _ .
Parsing [sent. 2145 len. 40]: Born in 1593 , notwithstanding his exquisite art , he could not escape being influenced by the faulty tendencies of his age , borne in upon his youth by the example of his mother 's friend , Dr. Donne .
Parsing [sent. 2146 len. 18]: A man must be a giant like Shakspere or Milton to cast off his age 's faults .
Parsing [sent. 2147 len. 68]: Indeed no man has more of the `` quips and cranks and wanton wiles '' of the poetic spirit of his time than George Herbert , but with this difference from the rest of Dr. Donne 's school , that such is the indwelling potency that it causes even these to shine with a radiance such that we wish them still to burn and not be consumed .
Parsing [sent. 2148 len. 31]: His muse is seldom other than graceful , even when her motions are grotesque , and he is always a gentleman , which can not be said of his master .
Parsing [sent. 2149 len. 25]: We could not bear to part with his most fantastic oddities , they are so interpenetrated with his genius as well as his art .
Parsing [sent. 2150 len. 65]: In relation to the use he makes of these faulty forms , and to show that even herein he has exercised a refraining judgment , though indeed fancying he has quite discarded in only somewhat reforming it , I recommend the study of two poems , each of which he calls _ Jordan _ , though why I have not yet with certainty discovered .
Parsing [sent. 2151 len. 27]: It is possible that not many of his readers have observed the following instances of the freakish in his rhyming art , which however result well .
Parsing [sent. 2152 len. 30]: When I say so , I would not be supposed to approve of the freak , but only to acknowledge the success of the poet in his immediate intent .
Parsing [sent. 2153 len. 28]: They are related to a certain tendency to mechanical contrivance not seldom associated with a love of art : it is art operating in the physical understanding .
Parsing [sent. 2154 len. 33]: In the poem called _ Home _ , every stanza is perfectly finished till the last : in it , with an access of art or artfulness , he destroys the rhyme .
Parsing [sent. 2155 len. 23]: I shall not quarrel with my reader if he calls it the latter , and regards it as art run to seed .
Parsing [sent. 2156 len. 17]: And yet -- and yet -- I confess I have a latent liking for the trick .
Parsing [sent. 2157 len. 24]: I shall give one or two stanzas out of the rather long poem , to lead up to the change in the last .
Parsing [sent. 2158 len. 38]: Come , Lord ; my head doth burn , my heart is sick , While thou dost ever , ever stay ; Thy long deferrings wound me to the quick ; My spirit gaspeth night and day .
Parsing [sent. 2159 len. 13]: O show thyself to me , Or take me up to thee .
Parsing [sent. 2160 len. 36]: Nothing but drought and dearth , but bush and brake , Which way soe'er I look I see : Some may dream merrily , but when they wake They dress themselves and come to thee .
Parsing [sent. 2161 len. 13]: O show thyself to me , Or take me up to thee .
Parsing [sent. 2162 len. 47]: Come , dearest Lord , pass not this holy season , My flesh and bones and joints do pray ; And even my verse , when by the rhyme and reason The word is _ stay _ , -LSB- 100 -RSB- says ever _ come _ .
Parsing [sent. 2163 len. 13]: O show thyself to me , Or take me up to thee .
Parsing [sent. 2164 len. 11]: Balancing this , my second instance is of the converse .
Parsing [sent. 2165 len. 24]: In all the stanzas but the last , the last line in each hangs unrhymed : in the last the rhyming is fulfilled .
Parsing [sent. 2166 len. 8]: The poem is called _ Denial _ .
Parsing [sent. 2167 len. 8]: I give only a part of it .
Parsing [sent. 2168 len. 29]: When my devotions could not pierce Thy silent ears , Then was my heart broken as was my verse ; My breast was full of fears And disorder .
Parsing [sent. 2169 len. 20]: O that thou shouldst give dust a tongue To cry to thee , And then not hear it crying !
Parsing [sent. 2170 len. 14]: All day long My heart was in my knee : But no hearing !
Parsing [sent. 2171 len. 29]: Therefore my soul lay out of sight , Untuned , unstrung ; My feeble spirit , unable to look right , Like a nipt blossom , hung Discontented .
Parsing [sent. 2172 len. 32]: O cheer and tune my heartless breast -- Defer no time ; That so thy favours granting my request , They and my mind may chime , And mend my rhyme .
Parsing [sent. 2173 len. 19]: It had been hardly worth the space to point out these , were not the matter itself precious .
Parsing [sent. 2174 len. 33]: Before making further remark on George Herbert , let me present one of his poems in which the oddity of the visual fancy is only equalled by the beauty of the result .
Parsing [sent. 2175 len. 3]: THE PULLEY .
Parsing [sent. 2176 len. 47]: When God at first made man , Having a glass of blessing standing by , `` Let us , '' said he , `` pour on him all we can : Let the world 's riches , which disperséd lie , Contract into a span . ''
Parsing [sent. 2177 len. 18]: So strength first made a way ; Then beauty flowed ; then wisdom , honour , pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 2178 len. 28]: When almost all was out , God made a stay , Perceiving that , alone of all his treasure , _ Rest _ in the bottom lay .
Parsing [sent. 2179 len. 45]: `` For if I should , '' said he , `` Bestow this jewel also on my creature , He would adore my gifts instead of me , And rest in nature , not the God of nature : So both should losers be .
Parsing [sent. 2180 len. 43]: `` Yet let him keep the rest -- But keep them with repining restlessness : Let him be rich and weary , that , at least , If goodness lead him not , yet weariness May toss him to my breast . ''
Parsing [sent. 2181 len. 16]: Is it not the story of the world written with the point of a diamond ?
Parsing [sent. 2182 len. 42]: There can hardly be a doubt that his tendency to unnatural forms was encouraged by the increase of respect to symbol and ceremony shown at this period by some of the external powers of the church -- Bishop Laud in particular .
Parsing [sent. 2183 len. 75]: Had all , however , who delight in symbols , a power , like George Herbert 's , of setting even within the horn-lanterns of the more arbitrary of them , such a light of poetry and devotion that their dull sides vanish in its piercing shine , and we forget the symbol utterly in the truth which it can not obscure , then indeed our part would be to take and be thankful .
Parsing [sent. 2184 len. 34]: But there never has been even a living true symbol which the dulness of those who will see the truth only in the symbol has not degraded into the very cockatrice-egg of sectarianism .
Parsing [sent. 2185 len. 20]: The symbol is by such always more or less idolized , and the light within more or less patronized .
Parsing [sent. 2186 len. 31]: If the truth , for the sake of which all symbols exist , were indeed the delight of those who claim it , the sectarianism of the church would vanish .
Parsing [sent. 2187 len. 40]: But men on all sides call that _ the truth _ which is but its form or outward sign -- material or verbal , true or arbitrary , it matters not which -- and hence come strifes and divisions .
Parsing [sent. 2188 len. 56]: Although George Herbert , however , could thus illumine all with his divine inspiration , we can not help wondering whether , if he had betaken himself yet more to vital and less to half artificial symbols , the change would not have been a breaking of the pitcher and an outshining of the lamp .
Parsing [sent. 2189 len. 26]: For a symbol may remind us of the truth , and at the same time obscure it -- present it , and dull its effect .
Parsing [sent. 2190 len. 41]: It is the temple of nature and not the temple of the church , the things made by the hands of God and not the things made by the hands of man , that afford the truest symbols of truth .
Parsing [sent. 2191 len. 7]: I am anxious to be understood .
Parsing [sent. 2192 len. 25]: The chief symbol of our faith , _ the Cross _ , it may be said , is not one of these natural symbols .
Parsing [sent. 2193 len. 13]: I answer -- No ; but neither is it an arbitrary symbol .
Parsing [sent. 2194 len. 41]: It is not a symbol of _ a truth _ at all , but of _ a fact _ , of the infinitely grandest fact in the universe , which is itself the outcome and symbol of the grandest Truth .
Parsing [sent. 2195 len. 27]: _ The Cross _ is an historical _ sign _ , not properly _ a symbol _ , except through the facts it reminds us of .
Parsing [sent. 2196 len. 42]: On the other hand , _ baptism _ and the _ eucharist _ are symbols of the loftiest and profoundest kind , true to nature and all its meanings , as well as to the facts of which they remind us .
Parsing [sent. 2197 len. 15]: They are in themselves symbols of the truths involved in the facts they commemorate .
Parsing [sent. 2198 len. 31]: Of Nature 's symbols George Herbert has made large use ; but he would have been yet a greater poet if he had made a larger use of them still .
Parsing [sent. 2199 len. 51]: Then at least we might have got rid of such oddities as the stanzas for steps up to the church-door , the first at the bottom of the page ; of the lines shaped into ugly altar-form ; and of the absurd Easter wings , made of ever lengthening lines .
Parsing [sent. 2200 len. 129]: This would not have been much , I confess , nor the gain by their loss great ; but not to mention the larger supply of images graceful with the grace of God , who when he had made them said they were good , it would have led to the further purification of his taste , perhaps even to the casting out of all that could untimely move our mirth ; until possibly -LRB- for illustration -RRB- , instead of this lovely stanza , he would have given us even a lovelier : Listen , sweet dove , unto my song , And spread thy golden wings on me ; Hatching my tender heart so long , Till it get wing , and fly away with thee .
Parsing [sent. 2201 len. 47]: The stanza is indeed lovely , and true and tender and clever as well ; yet who can help smiling at the notion of the incubation of the heart-egg , although what the poet means is so good that the smile almost vanishes in a sigh ?
Parsing [sent. 2202 len. 56]: There is no doubt that the works of man 's hands will also afford many true symbols ; but I do think that , in proportion as a man gives himself to those instead of studying Truth 's wardrobe of forms in nature , so will he decline from the high calling of the poet .
Parsing [sent. 2203 len. 77]: George Herbert was too great to be himself much injured by the narrowness of the field whence he gathered his symbols ; but his song will be the worse for it in the ears of all but those who , having lost sight of or having never beheld the oneness of the God whose creation exists in virtue of his redemption , feel safer in a low-browed crypt than under `` the high embowed roof . ''
Parsing [sent. 2204 len. 53]: When the desire after system or order degenerates from a need into a passion , or ruling idea , it closes , as may be seen in many women who are especial house-keepers , like an unyielding skin over the mind , to the death of all development from impulse and aspiration .
Parsing [sent. 2205 len. 18]: The same thing holds in the church : anxiety about order and system will kill the life .
Parsing [sent. 2206 len. 46]: This did not go near to being the result with George Herbert : his life was hid with Christ in God ; but the influence of his _ profession _ , as distinguished from his work , was hurtful to his calling as a poet .
Parsing [sent. 2207 len. 138]: He of all men would scorn to claim social rank for spiritual service ; he of all men would not commit the blunder of supposing that prayer and praise are that service of God : they are _ prayer _ and _ praise _ , not _ service _ ; he knew that God can be served only through loving ministration to his sons and daughters , all needy of commonest human help : but , as the most devout of clergymen will be the readiest to confess , there is even a danger to their souls in the unvarying recurrence of the outward obligations of their service ; and , in like manner , the poet will fare ill if the conventions from which the holiest system is not free send him soaring with sealed eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2208 len. 25]: George Herbert 's were but a little blinded thus ; yet something , we must allow , his poetry was injured by his profession .
Parsing [sent. 2209 len. 44]: All that I say on this point , however , so far from diminishing his praise , adds thereto , setting forth only that he was such a poet as might have been greater yet , had the divine gift had free course .
Parsing [sent. 2210 len. 16]: But again I rebuke myself and say , `` Thank God for George Herbert . ''
Parsing [sent. 2211 len. 32]: To rid our spiritual palates of the clinging flavour of criticism , let me choose another song from his precious legacy -- one less read , I presume , than many .
Parsing [sent. 2212 len. 54]: It shows his tendency to asceticism -- the fancy of forsaking God 's world in order to serve him ; it has besides many of the faults of the age , even to that of punning ; yet it is a lovely bit of art as well as a rich embodiment of tenderness .
Parsing [sent. 2213 len. 3]: THE THANKSGIVING .
Parsing [sent. 2214 len. 5]: Oh King of grief !
Parsing [sent. 2215 len. 14]: a title strange yet true , To thee of all kings only due !
Parsing [sent. 2216 len. 5]: Oh King of wounds !
Parsing [sent. 2217 len. 14]: how shall I grieve for thee , Who in all grief preventest me ?
Parsing [sent. 2218 len. 5]: _ goest before me .
Parsing [sent. 2219 len. 6]: _ Shall I weep blood ?
Parsing [sent. 2220 len. 16]: Why , thou hast wept such store , That all thy body was one gore .
Parsing [sent. 2221 len. 11]: Shall I be scourgéd , flouted , boxéd , sold ?
Parsing [sent. 2222 len. 10]: 'T is but to tell the tale is told .
Parsing [sent. 2223 len. 14]: _ My God , my God , why dost thou part from me ?
Parsing [sent. 2224 len. 10]: _ Was such a grief as can not be .
Parsing [sent. 2225 len. 17]: Shall I then sing , skipping thy doleful story , And side with thy triumphant glory ?
Parsing [sent. 2226 len. 7]: Shall thy strokes be my stroking ?
Parsing [sent. 2227 len. 4]: thorns my flower ?
Parsing [sent. 2228 len. 6]: Thy rod , my posy ?
Parsing [sent. 2229 len. 8]: -LSB- 101 -RSB- cross , my bower ?
Parsing [sent. 2230 len. 17]: But how then shall I imitate thee , and Copy thy fair , though bloody hand ?
Parsing [sent. 2231 len. 16]: Surely I will revenge me on thy love , And try who shall victorious prove .
Parsing [sent. 2232 len. 18]: If thou dost give me wealth , I will restore All back unto thee by the poor .
Parsing [sent. 2233 len. 17]: If thou dost give me honour , men shall see The honour doth belong to thee .
Parsing [sent. 2234 len. 19]: I will not marry ; or if she be mine , She and her children shall be thine .
Parsing [sent. 2235 len. 18]: My bosom-friend , if he blaspheme thy name , I will tear thence his love and fame .
Parsing [sent. 2236 len. 19]: One half of me being gone , the rest I give Unto some chapel -- die or live .
Parsing [sent. 2237 len. 21]: As for my Passion -LSB- 102 -RSB- -- But of that anon , When with the other I have done .
Parsing [sent. 2238 len. 38]: For thy Predestination , I 'll contrive That , three years hence , if I survive , -LSB- 103 -RSB- I 'll build a spital , or mend common ways , But mend my own without delays .
Parsing [sent. 2239 len. 19]: Then I will use the works of thy creation , As if I used them but for fashion .
Parsing [sent. 2240 len. 18]: The world and I will quarrel ; and the year Shall not perceive that I am here .
Parsing [sent. 2241 len. 19]: My music shall find thee , and every string Shall have his attribute to sing , _ its .
Parsing [sent. 2242 len. 17]: _ That all together may accord in thee , And prove one God , one harmony .
Parsing [sent. 2243 len. 22]: If thou shall give me wit , it shall appear ; If thou hast given it me , 't is here .
Parsing [sent. 2244 len. 42]: Nay , I will read thy book , -LSB- 104 -RSB- and never move Till I have found therein thy love -- Thy art of love , which I 'll turn back on thee : O my dear Saviour , Victory !
Parsing [sent. 2245 len. 16]: Then for my Passion -- I will do for that -- Alas , my God !
Parsing [sent. 2246 len. 5]: I know not what .
Parsing [sent. 2247 len. 15]: With the preceding must be taken the following , which comes immediately after it .
Parsing [sent. 2248 len. 3]: THE REPRISAL .
Parsing [sent. 2249 len. 33]: I have considered it , and find There is no dealing with thy mighty Passion ; For though I die for thee , I am behind : My sins deserve the condemnation .
Parsing [sent. 2250 len. 33]: O make me innocent , that I May give a disentangled state and free ; And yet thy wounds still my attempts defy , For by thy death I die for thee .
Parsing [sent. 2251 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 2252 len. 14]: was it not enough that thou By thy eternal glory didst outgo me ?
Parsing [sent. 2253 len. 17]: Couldst thou not grief 's sad conquest me allow , But in all victories overthrow me ?
Parsing [sent. 2254 len. 31]: Yet by confession will I come Into the conquest : though I can do nought Against thee , in thee I will overcome The man who once against thee fought .
Parsing [sent. 2255 len. 22]: Even embracing the feet of Jesus , Mary Magdalene or George Herbert must rise and go forth to do his will .
Parsing [sent. 2256 len. 48]: It will be observed how much George Herbert goes beyond all that have preceded him , in the expression of feeling as it flows from individual conditions , in the analysis of his own moods , in the logic of worship , if I may say so .
Parsing [sent. 2257 len. 25]: His utterance is not merely of personal love and grief , but of the peculiar love and grief in the heart of George Herbert .
Parsing [sent. 2258 len. 25]: There may be disease in such a mind ; but , if there be , it is a disease that will burn itself out .
Parsing [sent. 2259 len. 16]: Such disease is , for men constituted like him , the only path to health .
Parsing [sent. 2260 len. 57]: By health I mean that simple regard to the truth , to the will of God , which will turn away a man 's eyes from his own conditions , and leave God free to work his perfection in him -- free , that is , of the interference of the man 's self-consciousness and anxiety .
Parsing [sent. 2261 len. 41]: To this perfection St. Paul had come when he no longer cried out against the body of his death , no more judged his own self , but left all to the Father , caring only to do his will .
Parsing [sent. 2262 len. 25]: It was enough to him then that God should judge him , for his will is the one good thing securing all good things .
Parsing [sent. 2263 len. 35]: Amongst the keener delights of the life which is at the door , I look for the face of George Herbert , with whom to talk humbly would be in bliss a higher bliss .
Parsing [sent. 2264 len. 3]: CHAPTER XIV .
Parsing [sent. 2265 len. 3]: JOHN MILTON .
Parsing [sent. 2266 len. 17]: John Milton , born in 1608 , was twenty-four years of age when George Herbert died .
Parsing [sent. 2267 len. 12]: Hardly might two good men present a greater contrast than these .
Parsing [sent. 2268 len. 9]: In power and size , Milton greatly excels .
Parsing [sent. 2269 len. 40]: If George Herbert 's utterance is like the sword-play of one skilful with the rapier , that of Milton is like the sword-play of an old knight , flashing his huge but keen-cutting blade in lightnings about his head .
Parsing [sent. 2270 len. 11]: Compared with Herbert , Milton was a man in health .
Parsing [sent. 2271 len. 15]: He never _ shows _ , at least , any diseased regard of himself .
Parsing [sent. 2272 len. 15]: His eye is fixed on the truth , and he knows of no ill-faring .
Parsing [sent. 2273 len. 18]: While a man looks thitherward , all the movements of his spirit reveal themselves only in peace .
Parsing [sent. 2274 len. 11]: Everything conspired , or , should I not rather say ?
Parsing [sent. 2275 len. 12]: everything was freely given , to make Milton a great poet .
Parsing [sent. 2276 len. 36]: Leaving the original seed of melody , the primordial song in the soul which all his life was an effort to utter , let us regard for a moment the circumstances that favoured its development .
Parsing [sent. 2277 len. 15]: -LSB- Illustration : His volant touch Fied and pursued transverse the resonant fugue . -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 2278 len. 72]: From childhood he had listened to the sounds of the organ ; doubtless himself often gave breath to the soundboard with his hands on the lever of the bellows , while his father 's volant touch , Instinct through all proportions low and high , Fled and pursued transverse the resonant fugue ; and the father 's organ-harmony we yet hear in the son 's verse as in none but his .
Parsing [sent. 2279 len. 17]: Those organ-sounds he has taken for the very breath of his speech , and articulated them .
Parsing [sent. 2280 len. 35]: He had education and leisure , freedom to think , to travel , to observe : he was more than thirty before he had to earn a mouthful of bread by his own labour .
Parsing [sent. 2281 len. 66]: Rushing at length into freedom 's battle , he stood in its storm with his hand on the wheel of the nation 's rudder , shouting many a bold word for God and the Truth , until , fulfilled of experience as of knowledge , God set up before him a canvas of utter darkness : he had to fill it with creatures of radiance .
Parsing [sent. 2282 len. 20]: God blinded him with his hand , that , like the nightingale , he might `` sing darkling . ''
Parsing [sent. 2283 len. 25]: Beyond all , his life was pure from his childhood , without which such poetry as his could never have come to the birth .
Parsing [sent. 2284 len. 23]: It is the pure in heart who shall see God at length ; the pure in heart who now hear his harmonies .
Parsing [sent. 2285 len. 30]: More than all yet , he devoted himself from the first to the will of God , and his prayer that he might write a great poem was heard .
Parsing [sent. 2286 len. 11]: The unity of his being is the strength of Milton .
Parsing [sent. 2287 len. 10]: He is harmony , sweet and bold , throughout .
Parsing [sent. 2288 len. 40]: Not Philip Sidney , not George Herbert loved words and their melodies more than he ; while in their use he is more serious than either , and harder to please , uttering a music they have rarely approached .
Parsing [sent. 2289 len. 45]: Yet even when speaking with `` most miraculous organ , '' with a grandeur never heard till then , he overflows in speech more like that of other men than theirs -- he utters himself more simply , straightforwardly , dignifiedly , than they .
Parsing [sent. 2290 len. 17]: His modes are larger and more human , more near to the forms of primary thought .
Parsing [sent. 2291 len. 15]: Faithful and obedient to his art , he spends his power in no diversions .
Parsing [sent. 2292 len. 30]: Like Shakspere , he can be silent , never hesitating to sweep away the finest lines should they mar the intent , progress , and flow of his poem .
Parsing [sent. 2293 len. 42]: Even while he sings most abandonedly , it is ever with a care of his speech , it is ever with ordered words : not one shall dull the clarity of his verse by unlicensed , that is , needless presence .
Parsing [sent. 2294 len. 15]: But let not my reader fancy that this implies laborious utterance and strained endeavour .
Parsing [sent. 2295 len. 17]: It is weakness only which by the agony of visible effort enhances the magnitude of victory .
Parsing [sent. 2296 len. 28]: The trained athlete will move with the grace of a child , for he has not to seek how to effect that which he means to perform .
Parsing [sent. 2297 len. 32]: Milton has only to take good heed , and with no greater effort than it costs the ordinary man to avoid talking like a fool , he sings like an archangel .
Parsing [sent. 2298 len. 23]: But I must not enlarge my remarks , for of his verse even I can find room for only a few lyrics .
Parsing [sent. 2299 len. 23]: In them , however , we shall still find the simplest truth , the absolute of life , the poet 's aim .
Parsing [sent. 2300 len. 34]: He is ever soaring towards the region beyond perturbation , the true condition of soul ; that is , wherein a man shall see things even as God would have him see them .
Parsing [sent. 2301 len. 29]: He has no time to droop his pinions , and sit moody even on the highest pine : the sun is above him ; he must fly upwards .
Parsing [sent. 2302 len. 43]: The youth who at three-and-twenty could write the following sonnet , might well at five-and-forty be capable of writing the one that follows : How soon hath Time , the subtle thief of youth , Stolen on his wing my three-and-twentieth year !
Parsing [sent. 2303 len. 21]: My hasting days fly on with full career , But my late spring no bud or blossom shew ` th .
Parsing [sent. 2304 len. 34]: Perhaps my semblance might deceive the truth That I to manhood am arrived so near ; And inward ripeness doth much less appear , That some more timely happy spirits endu ` th .
Parsing [sent. 2305 len. 61]: Yet be it less or more , or soon or slow , It shall be still in strictest measure even To that same lot , however mean or high , Toward which time leads me and the will of heaven : All is -- if I have grace to use it so As ever in my great Task-master 's eye .
Parsing [sent. 2306 len. 43]: The _ It _ which is the subject of the last six lines is his _ Ripeness _ : it will keep pace with his approaching lot ; when it arrives he will be ready for it , whatever it may be .
Parsing [sent. 2307 len. 9]: The will of heaven is his happy fate .
Parsing [sent. 2308 len. 14]: Even at three-and-twenty , `` he that believeth shall not make haste . ''
Parsing [sent. 2309 len. 19]: Calm and open-eyed , he works to be ripe , and waits for the work that shall follow .
Parsing [sent. 2310 len. 81]: At forty-five , then , he writes thus concerning his blindness : When I consider how my life is spent Ere half my days in this dark world and wide , And that one talent , which is death to hide , Lodged with me useless , though my soul more bent To serve therewith my Maker , and present My true account , lest he , returning , chide -- `` Doth God exact day-labour , light denied ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2311 len. 4]: I fondly ask .
Parsing [sent. 2312 len. 8]: But Patience , to prevent _ foolishly .
Parsing [sent. 2313 len. 63]: _ That murmur , soon replies : `` God doth not need Either man 's work or his own gifts : who best Bear his mild yoke , they serve him best : his state Is kingly : thousands at his bidding speed , And post o'er land and ocean without rest : They also serve who only stand and wait . ''
Parsing [sent. 2314 len. 17]: That is , `` stand and wait , ready to go when they are called . ''
Parsing [sent. 2315 len. 12]: Everybody knows the sonnet , but how could I omit it ?
Parsing [sent. 2316 len. 13]: Both sonnets will grow more and more luminous as they are regarded .
Parsing [sent. 2317 len. 19]: The following I incline to think the finest of his short poems , certainly the grandest of them .
Parsing [sent. 2318 len. 16]: It is a little ode , written _ to be set on a clock-case _ .
Parsing [sent. 2319 len. 3]: ON TIME .
Parsing [sent. 2320 len. 12]: Fly , envious Time , till thou run out thy race .
Parsing [sent. 2321 len. 48]: Call on the lazy leaden-stepping hours , Whose speed is but the heavy plummet 's pace , And glut thyself with what thy womb devours -- Which is no more than what is false and vain , And merely mortal dross : So little is our loss !
Parsing [sent. 2322 len. 6]: So little is thy gain !
Parsing [sent. 2323 len. 49]: For whenas each thing bad thou hast entombed , And last of all thy greedy self consumed , Then long eternity shall greet our bliss With an individual kiss ; _ that can not be divided -- And joy shall overtake us as a flood ; -LSB- eternal .
Parsing [sent. 2324 len. 68]: _ When everything that is sincerely good , And perfectly divine With truth and peace and love , shall ever shine About the supreme throne Of him to whose happy-making sight alone When once our heavenly-guided soul shall climb , Then , all this earthy grossness quit , Attired with stars , we shall for ever sit Triumphing over Death and Chance and thee , O Time .
Parsing [sent. 2325 len. 16]: The next I give is likewise an ode -- a more _ beautiful _ one .
Parsing [sent. 2326 len. 41]: Observe in both the fine effect of the short lines , essential to the nature of the ode , being that which gives its solemnity the character yet of a song , or rather , perhaps , of a chant .
Parsing [sent. 2327 len. 33]: In this he calls upon Voice and Verse to rouse and raise our imagination until we hear the choral song of heaven , and hearing become able to sing in tuneful response .
Parsing [sent. 2328 len. 5]: AT A SOLEMN MUSIC .
Parsing [sent. 2329 len. 195]: Blest pair of sirens , pledges of heaven 's joy Sphere-born harmonious sisters , Voice and Verse , Wed your divine sounds , and mixed power employ -- Dead things with inbreathed sense able to pierce -- And to our high-raised phantasy present That undisturbed song of pure concent -LSB- 105 -RSB- Aye sung before the sapphire-coloured throne To him that sits thereon , With saintly shout , and solemn jubilee ; Where the bright seraphim , in burning row , Their loud uplifted angel trumpets blow ; And the cherubic host in thousand choirs , Touch their immortal harps of golden wires , With those just spirits that wear victorious palms , Hymns devout and holy psalms Singing everlastingly ; That we on earth , with undiscording voice , May rightly answer that melodious noise -- As once we did , till disproportioned -LSB- 106 -RSB- Sin Jarred against Nature 's chime , and with harsh din Broke the fair music that all creatures made To their great Lord , whose love their motion swayed In perfect diapason , -LSB- 107 -RSB- whilst they stood In first obedience and their state of good .
Parsing [sent. 2330 len. 43]: O may we soon again renew that song , And keep in tune with heaven , till God ere long To his celestial consort -LSB- 108 -RSB- us unite , To live with him , and sing in endless morn of light !
Parsing [sent. 2331 len. 10]: Music was the symbol of all Truth to Milton .
Parsing [sent. 2332 len. 11]: He would count it falsehood to write an unmusical verse .
Parsing [sent. 2333 len. 32]: I allow that some of his blank lines may appear unrhythmical ; but Experience , especially if she bring with her a knowledge of Dante , will elucidate all their movements .
Parsing [sent. 2334 len. 22]: I exhort my younger friends to read Milton aloud when they are alone , and thus learn the worth of word-sounds .
Parsing [sent. 2335 len. 11]: They will find him even in this an educating force .
Parsing [sent. 2336 len. 23]: The last ode ought to be thus read for the magnificent dance-march of its motion , as well as for its melody .
Parsing [sent. 2337 len. 41]: Show me one who delights in the _ Hymn on the Nativity _ , and I will show you one who may never indeed be a singer in this world , but who is already a listener to the best .
Parsing [sent. 2338 len. 12]: But how different it is from anything of George Herbert 's !
Parsing [sent. 2339 len. 22]: It sets forth no feeling peculiar to Milton ; it is an outburst of the gladness of the company of believers .
Parsing [sent. 2340 len. 52]: Every one has at least read the glorious poem ; but were I to leave it out I should have lost , not the sapphire of aspiration , not the topaz of praise , not the emerald of holiness , but the carbuncle of delight from the high priest 's breast-plate .
Parsing [sent. 2341 len. 24]: And I must give the introduction too : it is the cloudy grove of an overture , whence rushes the torrent of song .
Parsing [sent. 2342 len. 8]: ON THE MORNING OF CHRIST 'S NATIVITY .
Parsing [sent. 2343 len. 63]: This is the month , and this the happy morn , Wherein the son of heaven 's eternal king , Of wedded maid and virgin mother born , Our great redemption from above did bring ; For so the holy sages once did sing , That he our deadly forfeit should release , And with his Father work us a perpetual peace .
Parsing [sent. 2344 len. 63]: That glorious form , that light insufferable , And that far-beaming blaze of majesty , Wherewith he wont -LSB- 109 -RSB- at heaven 's high council-table To sit the midst of trinal unity , He laid aside , and here with us to be , Forsook the courts of everlasting day , And chose with us a darksome house of mortal clay .
Parsing [sent. 2345 len. 18]: Say , heavenly Muse , shall not thy sacred vein Afford a present to the infant God ?
Parsing [sent. 2346 len. 52]: Hast thou no verse , no hymn , or solemn strain To welcome him to this his new abode , Now while the heaven , by the sun 's team untrod , Hath took no print of the approaching light , And all the spangled host keep watch in squadrons bright ?
Parsing [sent. 2347 len. 18]: See how , from far upon the eastern road , The star-led wizards haste with odours sweet !
Parsing [sent. 2348 len. 48]: O run , prevent them with thy humble ode , And lay it lowly at his blessed feet ; Have thou the honour first thy Lord to greet ; And join thy voice unto the angel choir , From out his secret altar touched with hallowed fire .
Parsing [sent. 2349 len. 3]: THE HYMN .
Parsing [sent. 2350 len. 56]: It was the winter wild While the heaven-born child All meanly wrapt in the rude manger lies ; Nature , in awe to him , Had doffed her gaudy trim , With her great master so to sympathize : It was no season then for her To wanton with the sun , her lusty paramour .
Parsing [sent. 2351 len. 53]: Only with speeches fair She woos the gentle air To hide her guilty front with innocent snow ; And on her naked shame , Pollute with sinful blame , The saintly veil of maiden white to throw ; Confounded that her maker 's eyes Should look so near upon her foul deformities .
Parsing [sent. 2352 len. 14]: But he , her fears to cease , Sent down the meek-eyed Peace .
Parsing [sent. 2353 len. 45]: She , crowned with olive green , came softly sliding Down through the turning sphere , His ready harbinger , With turtle wing the amorous clouds dividing ; And waving wide her myrtle wand , She strikes a universal peace through sea and land .
Parsing [sent. 2354 len. 52]: No war , or battle 's sound , Was heard the world around ; The idle spear and shield were high uphung ; The hookéd chariot stood Unstained with hostile blood ; The trumpet spake not to the arméd throng ; And kings sat still with awful eye , _ awe-filled .
Parsing [sent. 2355 len. 12]: _ As if they surely knew their sovereign Lord was by .
Parsing [sent. 2356 len. 29]: But peaceful was the night Wherein the Prince of Light His reign of peace upon the earth began ; The winds , with wonder whist , _ silent .
Parsing [sent. 2357 len. 36]: _ Smoothly the water kissed , Whispering new joys to the mild Oceän , Who now hath quite forgot to rave , While birds of calm -LSB- 110 -RSB- sit brooding on the charméd wave .
Parsing [sent. 2358 len. 60]: The stars with deep amaze Stand fixed in stedfast gaze , Bending one way their precious influence ; And will not take their flight For all the morning light , Or Lucifer , -LSB- 111 -RSB- that often warned them thence ; But in their glimmering orbs did glow Until their Lord himself bespake , and bid them go .
Parsing [sent. 2359 len. 55]: And though the shady gloom Had given day her room , The sun himself withheld his wonted speed , And hid his head for shame , As his inferior flame The new enlightened world no more should need : He saw a greater sun appear Than his bright throne or burning axle-tree could bear .
Parsing [sent. 2360 len. 17]: The shepherds on the lawn , Or e'er the point of dawn , _ ere ever .
Parsing [sent. 2361 len. 17]: _ Sat simply chatting in a rustic row : Full little thought they than _ then .
Parsing [sent. 2362 len. 37]: _ That the mighty Pan -LSB- 112 -RSB- Was kindly come to live with them below ; Perhaps their loves , or else their sheep , Was all that did their silly thoughts so busy keep .
Parsing [sent. 2363 len. 53]: When such music sweet Their hearts and ears did greet As never was by mortal finger strook -- Divinely warbled voice Answering the stringéd noise , As all their souls in blissful rapture took : The air , such pleasure loath to lose , With thousand echoes still prolongs each heavenly close .
Parsing [sent. 2364 len. 59]: Nature , that heard such sound , Beneath the hollow round Of Cynthia 's seat -LSB- 113 -RSB- the airy region thrilling , Now was almost won To think her part was done , And that her reign had here its last fulfilling : She knew such harmony alone Could hold all heaven and earth in happier union .
Parsing [sent. 2365 len. 54]: At last surrounds their sight A globe of circular light , That with long beams the shame-faced night arrayed ; The helméd cherubim And sworded seraphim Are seen in glittering ranks with wings displayed , Harping in loud and solemn choir , With unexpressive -LSB- 114 -RSB- notes to heaven 's new-born heir .
Parsing [sent. 2366 len. 59]: Such music , as 't is said , Before was never made , But when of old the sons of morning sung , While the Creator great His constellations set , And the well-balanced world on hinges hung , -LSB- 115 -RSB- And cast the dark foundations deep , And bid the weltering waves their oozy channel keep .
Parsing [sent. 2367 len. 66]: Ring out , ye crystal spheres ; Once bless our human ears -- If ye have power to touch our senses so ; -LSB- 116 -RSB- And let your silver chime Move in melodious time ; And let the bass of heaven 's deep organ blow ; And , with your ninefold harmony , Make up full consort -LSB- 117 -RSB- to the angelic symphony .
Parsing [sent. 2368 len. 62]: -LSB- 118 -RSB- For if such holy song Enwrap our fancy long , Time will run back and fetch the age of gold ; And speckled vanity Will sicken soon and die ; -LSB- 119 -RSB- And leprous sin will melt from earthly mould ; And hell itself will pass away , And leave her dolorous mansions to the peering day .
Parsing [sent. 2369 len. 60]: Yea , truth and justice then Will down return to men , Orbed in a rainbow ; and , like glories wearing , Mercy will sit between , Throned in celestial sheen , With radiant feet the tissued clouds down steering ; And heaven , as at some festival , Will open wide the gates of her high palace-hall .
Parsing [sent. 2370 len. 15]: But wisest Fate says `` No ; This must not yet be so . ''
Parsing [sent. 2371 len. 26]: The babe lies yet in smiling infancy , That on the bitter cross Must redeem our loss , So both himself and us to glorify .
Parsing [sent. 2372 len. 80]: Yet first , to those y-chained in sleep , The wakeful trump of doom must thunder through the deep , With such a horrid clang As on Mount Sinai rang , While the red fire and smouldering clouds outbrake : The agéd earth , aghast With terror of that blast , Shall from the surface to the centre shake , When , at the world 's last sessiön , The dreadful Judge in middle air shall spread his throne .
Parsing [sent. 2373 len. 62]: And then at last our bliss Full and perfect is : But now begins ; for from this happy day , The old dragon , under ground In straiter limits bound , Not half so far casts his usurped sway ; And , wroth to see his kingdom fail , Swinges -LSB- 120 -RSB- the scaly horror of his folded tail .
Parsing [sent. 2374 len. 60]: -LSB- 121 -RSB- The oracles are dumb : -LSB- 122 -RSB- No voice or hideous hum Runs through the archéd roof in words deceiving ; Apollo from his shrine Can no more divine , With hollow shriek the steep of Delphos leaving ; No nightly trance , or breathed spell , Inspires the pale-eyed priest from the prophetic cell .
Parsing [sent. 2375 len. 56]: The lonely mountains o'er , And the resounding shore , A voice of weeping heard and loud lament ; From haunted spring and dale , Edged with poplar pale , The parting genius -LSB- 123 -RSB- is with sighing sent ; With flower-inwoven tresses torn , The nymphs in twilight shade of tangled thickets mourn .
Parsing [sent. 2376 len. 61]: In consecrated earth , And on the holy hearth , The Lars and Lemures -LSB- 124 -RSB- moan with midnight plaint ; In urns and altars round , A drear and dying sound Affrights the flamens -LSB- 125 -RSB- at their service quaint ; And the chill marble seems to sweat , While each peculiar power foregoes his wonted seat .
Parsing [sent. 2377 len. 25]: Peor and Baälim Forsake their temples dim , With that twice-battered god of Palestine ; And moonéd Ashtaroth , _ the Assyrian Venus _ .
Parsing [sent. 2378 len. 40]: Heaven 's queen and mother both , Now sits not girt with tapers ' holy shine ; The Lybic Hammon shrinks his horn ; -LSB- 126 -RSB- In vain the Tyrian maids their wounded Thammuz -LSB- 127 -RSB- mourn .
Parsing [sent. 2379 len. 43]: And sullen Moloch , fled , Hath left in shadows dread His burning idol , all of blackest hue : In vain with cymbals ' ring They call the grisly -LSB- 128 -RSB- king , In dismal dance about the furnace blue .
Parsing [sent. 2380 len. 18]: The brutish gods of Nile as fast -- Isis and Orus and the dog Anubis -- haste .
Parsing [sent. 2381 len. 83]: Nor is Osiris -LSB- 129 -RSB- seen In Memphian grove or green , Trampling the unshowered -LSB- 130 -RSB- grass with lowings loud ; Nor can he be at rest Within his sacred chest ; Nought but profoundest hell can be his shroud ; In vain , with timbrelled anthems dark , The sable-stoléd sorcerers bear his worshipped ark : He feels , from Judah 's land , The dreaded infant 's hand ; The rays of Bethlehem blind his dusky eyn .
Parsing [sent. 2382 len. 37]: Nor all the gods beside Longer dare abide -- Not Typhon huge , ending in snaky twine : Our babe , to show his Godhead true , Can in his swaddling bands control the damnéd crew .
Parsing [sent. 2383 len. 54]: So , when the sun in bed , Curtained with cloudy red , Pillows his chin upon an orient wave , The flocking shadows pale Troop to the infernal jail -- Each fettered ghost slips to his several grave ; And the yellow-skirted fays Fly after the night-steeds , leaving their moon-loved maze .
Parsing [sent. 2384 len. 61]: But see , the Virgin blest Hath laid her babe to rest : Time is our tedious song should here have ending ; Heaven 's youngest-teemed star -LSB- 131 -RSB- Hath fixed her polished car , Her sleeping Lord with handmaid lamp attending ; And all about the courtly stable Bright-harnessed -LSB- 132 -RSB- angels sit , in order serviceable .
Parsing [sent. 2385 len. 49]: -LSB- 133 -RSB- If my reader should think some of the rhymes bad , and some of the words oddly used , I would remind him that both pronunciations and meanings have altered since : the probability is , that the older forms in both are the better .
Parsing [sent. 2386 len. 12]: Milton will not use a wrong word or a bad rhyme .
Parsing [sent. 2387 len. 69]: With regard to the form of the poem , let him observe the variety of length of line in the stanza , and how skilfully the varied lines are associated -- two of six syllables and one of ten ; then the same repeated ; then one of eight and one of twelve -- no two , except of the shortest , coming together of the same length .
Parsing [sent. 2388 len. 23]: Its stanza is its own : I do not know another poem written in the same ; and its music is exquisite .
Parsing [sent. 2389 len. 37]: The probability is that , if the reader note any fact in the poem , however trifling it might seem to the careless eye , it will repay him by unfolding both individual and related beauty .
Parsing [sent. 2390 len. 40]: Then let him ponder the pictures given : the sudden arraying of the shame-faced night in long beams ; the amazed kings silent on their thrones ; the birds brooding on the sea : he will find many such .
Parsing [sent. 2391 len. 12]: Let him consider the clear-cut epithets , so full of meaning .
Parsing [sent. 2392 len. 35]: A true poet may be at once known by the justice and force of the adjectives he uses , especially when he compounds them , -- that is , makes one out of two .
Parsing [sent. 2393 len. 40]: Here are some examples : _ meek-eyed Peace ; pale-eyed priest ; speckled vanity ; smouldering clouds ; hideous hum ; dismal dance ; dusky eyne : _ there are many such , each almost a poem in itself .
Parsing [sent. 2394 len. 19]: The whole is a succession of pictures set in the loveliest music for the utterance of grandest thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 2395 len. 42]: No doubt there are in the poem instances of such faults in style as were common in the age in which his verse was rooted : for my own part , I never liked the first two stanzas of the hymn .
Parsing [sent. 2396 len. 37]: But such instances are few ; while for a right feeling of the marvel of this poem and of the two preceding it , we must remember that Milton was only twenty-one when he wrote them .
Parsing [sent. 2397 len. 54]: Apparently to make one of a set with the _ Nativity _ , he began to write an ode on the _ Passion _ , but , finding the subject `` above the years he had when he wrote it , and nothing satisfied with what was begun , left it unfinished . ''
Parsing [sent. 2398 len. 55]: The fragment is full of unworthy , though skilful , and , for such , powerful conceits , but is especially interesting as showing how even Milton , trying to write about what he felt , but without yet having generated thoughts enow concerning the subject itself , could only fall back on conventionalities .
Parsing [sent. 2399 len. 27]: Happy the young poet the wisdom of whose earliest years was such that he recognized his mistake almost at the outset , and dropped the attempt !
Parsing [sent. 2400 len. 46]: Amongst the stanzas there is , however , one of exceeding loveliness : He , sovereign priest , stooping his regal head , That dropped with odorous oil down his fair eyes , Poor fleshly tabernacle enteréd , His starry front low-roofed beneath the skies .
Parsing [sent. 2401 len. 7]: Oh what a masque was there !
Parsing [sent. 2402 len. 4]: what a disguise !
Parsing [sent. 2403 len. 3]: Yet more !
Parsing [sent. 2404 len. 20]: the stroke of death he must abide ; Then lies him meekly down fast by his brethren 's side .
Parsing [sent. 2405 len. 39]: In this it will be seen that he has left the jubilant measure of the _ Hymn _ , and returned to the more stately and solemn rhyme-royal of its overture , as more suited to his subject .
Parsing [sent. 2406 len. 23]: Milton could not be wrong in his music , even when he found the quarry of his thought too hard to work .
Parsing [sent. 2407 len. 3]: CHAPTER XV .
Parsing [sent. 2408 len. 10]: EDMUND WALLER , THOMAS BROWN , AND JEREMY TAYLOR .
Parsing [sent. 2409 len. 26]: Edmund Waller , born in 1605 , was three years older than Milton ; but I had a fancy for not dividing Herbert and Milton .
Parsing [sent. 2410 len. 29]: As a poet he had a high reputation for many years , gained chiefly , I think , by a regard to literary proprieties , combined with wit .
Parsing [sent. 2411 len. 26]: He is graceful sometimes ; but what in his writings would with many pass for grace , is only smoothness and the absence of faults .
Parsing [sent. 2412 len. 8]: His horses were not difficult to drive .
Parsing [sent. 2413 len. 18]: He dares little and succeeds in proportion -- occasionally , however , flashing out into true song .
Parsing [sent. 2414 len. 54]: In politics he had no character -- let us hope from weakness rather than from selfishness ; yet , towards the close of his life , he wrote some poems which reveal a man not unaccustomed to ponder sacred things , and able to express his thoughts concerning them with force and justice .
Parsing [sent. 2415 len. 30]: From a poem called _ Of Divine Love _ , I gather the following very remarkable passages : I wish they had been enforced by greater nobility of character .
Parsing [sent. 2416 len. 7]: Still they are in themselves true .
Parsing [sent. 2417 len. 20]: Even where we have no proof of repentance , we may see plentiful signs of a growth towards it .
Parsing [sent. 2418 len. 22]: We can not tell how long the truth may of necessity require to interpenetrate the ramifications of a man 's nature .
Parsing [sent. 2419 len. 17]: By slow degrees he discovers that here it is not , and there it is not .
Parsing [sent. 2420 len. 21]: Again and again , and yet again , a man finds that he must be born with a new birth .
Parsing [sent. 2421 len. 55]: The fear of hell , or aiming to be blest , Savours too much of private interest : This moved not Moses , nor the zealous Paul , Who for their friends abandoned soul and all ; A greater yet from heaven to hell descends , To save and make his enemies his friends .
Parsing [sent. 2422 len. 22]: * * * * * That early love of creatures yet unmade , To frame the world the Almighty did persuade .
Parsing [sent. 2423 len. 61]: For love it was that first created light , Moved on the waters , chased away the night From the rude chaos ; and bestowed new grace On things disposed of to their proper place -- Some to rest here , and some to shine above : Earth , sea , and heaven , were all the effects of love .
Parsing [sent. 2424 len. 43]: * * * * * Not willing terror should his image move , He gives a pattern of eternal love : His son descends , to treat a peace with those Which were , and must have ever been , his foes .
Parsing [sent. 2425 len. 38]: Poor he became , and left his glorious seat , To make us humble , and to make us great ; His business here was happiness to give To those whose malice could not let him live .
Parsing [sent. 2426 len. 26]: * * * * * He to proud potentates would not be known : Of those that loved him , he was hid from none .
Parsing [sent. 2427 len. 40]: Till love appear , we live in anxious doubt ; But smoke will vanish when that flame breaks out : This is the fire that would consume our dross , Refine , and make us richer by the loss .
Parsing [sent. 2428 len. 25]: * * * * * Who for himself no miracle would make , Dispensed with -LSB- 134 -RSB- several for the people 's sake .
Parsing [sent. 2429 len. 22]: He that , long-fasting , would no wonder show , Made loaves and fishes , as they eat them , grow .
Parsing [sent. 2430 len. 42]: Of all his power , which boundless was above , Here he used none but to express his love ; And such a love would make our joy exceed , Not when our own , but others ' mouths we feed .
Parsing [sent. 2431 len. 10]: * * * * * Love as he loved !
Parsing [sent. 2432 len. 11]: A love so unconfined With arms extended would embrace mankind .
Parsing [sent. 2433 len. 36]: Self-love would cease , or be dilated , when We should behold as many selfs as men ; All of one family , in blood allied , His precious blood that for our ransom died .
Parsing [sent. 2434 len. 58]: * * * * * Amazed at once and comforted , to find A boundless power so infinitely kind , The soul contending to that light to fly From her dark cell , we practise how to die , Employing thus the poet 's wingéd art To reach this love , and grave it in our heart .
Parsing [sent. 2435 len. 40]: Joy so complete , so solid , and severe , Would leave no place for meaner pleasures there : Pale they would look , as stars that must be gone When from the east the rising sun comes on .
Parsing [sent. 2436 len. 21]: * * * * * To that and some other poems he adds the following -- a kind of epilogue .
Parsing [sent. 2437 len. 6]: ON THE FOREGOING DIVINE POEMS .
Parsing [sent. 2438 len. 48]: When we for age could neither read nor write , The subject made us able to indite : The soul with nobler resolutions decked , The body stooping , does herself erect : No mortal parts are requisite to raise Her that unbodied can her Maker praise .
Parsing [sent. 2439 len. 40]: The seas are quiet when the winds give o'er : So calm are we when passions are no more ; For then we know how vain it was to boast Of fleeting things , so certain to be lost .
Parsing [sent. 2440 len. 10]: Clouds of affection from our younger eyes _ passion .
Parsing [sent. 2441 len. 8]: _ Conceal that emptiness which age descries .
Parsing [sent. 2442 len. 39]: The soul 's dark cottage , battered and decayed , Lets in new light , through chinks that time has made : Stronger by weakness , wiser men become , As they draw near to their eternal home .
Parsing [sent. 2443 len. 19]: Leaving the old , both worlds at once they view That stand upon the threshold of the new .
Parsing [sent. 2444 len. 13]: It would be a poor victory where age was the sole conqueror .
Parsing [sent. 2445 len. 11]: But I doubt if age ever gains the victory alone .
Parsing [sent. 2446 len. 16]: Let Waller , however , have this praise : his song soars with his subject .
Parsing [sent. 2447 len. 6]: It is a true praise .
Parsing [sent. 2448 len. 42]: There are men who write well until they try the noble , and then they fare like the falling star , which , when sought where it fell , is , according to an old fancy , discovered a poor jelly .
Parsing [sent. 2449 len. 26]: Sir Thomas Brown , a physician , whose prose writings are as peculiar as they are valuable , was of the same age as Waller .
Parsing [sent. 2450 len. 39]: He partakes to a considerable degree of the mysticism which was so much followed in his day , only in his case it influences his literature most -- his mode of utterance more than his mode of thought .
Parsing [sent. 2451 len. 34]: His _ True Christian Morals _ is a very valuable book , notwithstanding the obscurity that sometimes arises in that , as in all his writings , from his fondness for Latin words .
Parsing [sent. 2452 len. 22]: The following fine hymn occurs in his _ Religio Medici _ , in which he gives an account of his opinions .
Parsing [sent. 2453 len. 30]: I am not aware of anything else that he has published in verse , though he must probably have written more to be able to write this so well .
Parsing [sent. 2454 len. 24]: It occurs in the midst of prose , as the prayer he says every night before he yields to the death of sleep .
Parsing [sent. 2455 len. 11]: I follow it with the succeeding sentence of the prose .
Parsing [sent. 2456 len. 5]: The night is come .
Parsing [sent. 2457 len. 14]: Like to the day , Depart not thou , great God , away .
Parsing [sent. 2458 len. 17]: Let not my sins , black as the night , Eclipse the lustre of thy light .
Parsing [sent. 2459 len. 18]: Keep still in my horizon , for to me The sun makes not the day but thee .
Parsing [sent. 2460 len. 28]: Thou whose nature can not sleep , On my temples sentry keep ; Guard me ` gainst those watchful foes Whose eyes are open while mine close .
Parsing [sent. 2461 len. 14]: Let no dreams my head infest But such as Jacob 's temples blest .
Parsing [sent. 2462 len. 44]: While I do rest , my soul advance ; Make my sleep a holy trance , That I may , my rest being wroughtt Awake into some holy thought , And with as active vigour run My course as doth the nimble sun .
Parsing [sent. 2463 len. 32]: Sleep is a death : O make me try By sleeping what it is to die , And as gently lay my head On my grave , as now my bed .
Parsing [sent. 2464 len. 16]: Howe'er I rest , great God , let me Awake again at least with thee .
Parsing [sent. 2465 len. 15]: And thus assured , behold I lie Securely , or to wake or die .
Parsing [sent. 2466 len. 32]: These are my drowsy days : in vain I do now wake to sleep again : O come that hour when I shall never Sleep again , but wake for ever .
Parsing [sent. 2467 len. 10]: `` This is the dormitive I take to bedward .
Parsing [sent. 2468 len. 37]: I need no other laudanum than this to make me sleep ; after which I close mine eyes in security , content to take my leave of the sun , and sleep unto the resurrection . ''
Parsing [sent. 2469 len. 40]: Jeremy Taylor , born in 1613 , was the most poetic of English prose-writers : if he had written verse equal to his prose , he would have had a lofty place amongst poets as well as amongst preachers .
Parsing [sent. 2470 len. 57]: Taking the opposite side from Milton , than whom he was five years younger , he was , like him , conscientious and consistent , suffering while Milton 's cause prospered , and advanced to one of the bishoprics hated of Milton 's soul when the scales of England 's politics turned in the other direction .
Parsing [sent. 2471 len. 12]: Such men , however , are divided only by their intellects .
Parsing [sent. 2472 len. 61]: When men say , `` I must or I must not , for it is right or it is not right , '' then are they in reality so bound together , even should they not acknowledge it themselves , that no opposing opinions , no conflicting theories concerning what is or is not right , can really part them .
Parsing [sent. 2473 len. 83]: It was not wonderful that a mind like that of Jeremy Taylor , best fitted for worshipping the beauty of holiness , should mourn over the disrupted order of his church , or that a mind like Milton 's , best fitted for the law of life , should demand that every part of that order which had ceased to vibrate responsive to every throb of the eternal heart of truth , should fall into the ruin which its death had preceded .
Parsing [sent. 2474 len. 19]: The church was hardly dealt with , but the rulers of the church have to bear the blame .
Parsing [sent. 2475 len. 33]: Here are those I judge the best of the bishop 's _ Festival Hymns _ , printed as part of his _ Golden Grove _ , or _ Gide to Devotion _ .
Parsing [sent. 2476 len. 23]: In the first there is a little confusion of imagery ; and in others of them will be found a little obscurity .
Parsing [sent. 2477 len. 63]: They bear marks of the careless impatience of rhythm and rhyme of one who though ever bursting into a natural trill of song , sometimes with more rhymes apparently than he intended , would yet rather let his thoughts pour themselves out in that unmeasured chant , that `` poetry in solution , '' which is the natural speech of the prophet-orator .
Parsing [sent. 2478 len. 26]: He is like a full river that must flow , which rejoices in a flood , and rebels against the constraint of mole or conduit .
Parsing [sent. 2479 len. 27]: He exults in utterance itself , caring little for the mode , which , however , the law of his indwelling melody guides though never compels .
Parsing [sent. 2480 len. 22]: Charmingly diffuse in his prose , his verse ever sounds as if it would overflow the banks of its self-imposed restraints .
Parsing [sent. 2481 len. 16]: THE SECOND HYMN FOR ADVENT ; OR , CHRIST 'S COMING TO JERUSALEM IN TRIUMPH .
Parsing [sent. 2482 len. 10]: Lord , come away ; Why dost thou stay ?
Parsing [sent. 2483 len. 21]: Thy road is ready ; and thy paths made straight With longing expectation wait The consecration of thy beauteous feet .
Parsing [sent. 2484 len. 16]: Ride on triumphantly : behold we lay Our lusts and proud wills in thy way .
Parsing [sent. 2485 len. 2]: Hosanna !
Parsing [sent. 2486 len. 5]: welcome to our hearts !
Parsing [sent. 2487 len. 32]: Lord , here Thou hast a temple too , and full as dear As that of Sion , and as full of sin : Nothing but thieves and robbers dwell therein .
Parsing [sent. 2488 len. 33]: Enter , and chase them forth , and cleanse the floor ; Crucify them , that they may never more Profane that holy place Where thou hast chose to set thy face .
Parsing [sent. 2489 len. 29]: And then if our stiff tongues shall be Mute in the praises of thy deity , The stones out of the temple-wall Shall cry aloud and call Hosanna !
Parsing [sent. 2490 len. 6]: and thy glorious footsteps greet .
Parsing [sent. 2491 len. 11]: HYMN FOR CHRISTMAS-DAY ; BEING A DIALOGUE BETWEEN THREE SHEPHERDS .
Parsing [sent. 2492 len. 2]: 1 .
Parsing [sent. 2493 len. 32]: Where is this blessed babe That hath made All the world so full of joy And expectation ; That glorious boy That crowns each nation With a triumphant wreath of blessedness ?
Parsing [sent. 2494 len. 2]: 2 .
Parsing [sent. 2495 len. 42]: Where should he be but in the throng , And among His angel ministers that sing And take wing Just as may echo to his voice , And rejoice , When wing and tongue and all May so procure their happiness ?
Parsing [sent. 2496 len. 2]: 3 .
Parsing [sent. 2497 len. 30]: But he hath other waiters now : A poor cow An ox and mule stand and behold , And wonder That a stable should enfold Him that can thunder .
Parsing [sent. 2498 len. 4]: _ Chorus _ .
Parsing [sent. 2499 len. 8]: O what a gracious God have we !
Parsing [sent. 2500 len. 3]: How good ?
Parsing [sent. 2501 len. 3]: How great ?
Parsing [sent. 2502 len. 5]: Even as our misery .
Parsing [sent. 2503 len. 5]: A HYMN FOR CHRISTMAS-DAY .
Parsing [sent. 2504 len. 31]: Awake , my soul , and come away ; Put on thy best array , Lest if thou longer stay , Thou lose some minutes of so blest a day .
Parsing [sent. 2505 len. 41]: Go run , And bid good-morrow to the sun ; Welcome his safe return To Capricorn , And that great morn Wherein a God was born , Whose story none can tell But he whose every word 's a miracle .
Parsing [sent. 2506 len. 16]: To-day Almightiness grew weak ; The Word itself was mute , and could not speak .
Parsing [sent. 2507 len. 32]: That Jacob 's star which made the sun To dazzle if he durst look on , Now mantled o'er in Bethlehem 's night , Borrowed a star to show him light .
Parsing [sent. 2508 len. 74]: He that begirt each zone , To whom both poles are one , Who grasped the zodiac in his hand , And made it move or stand , Is now by nature man , By stature but a span ; Eternity is now grown short ; A king is born without a court ; The water thirsts ; the fountain 's dry ; And life , being born , made apt to die .
Parsing [sent. 2509 len. 3]: _ Chorus .
Parsing [sent. 2510 len. 12]: _ Then let our praises emulate and vie With his humility !
Parsing [sent. 2511 len. 24]: Since he 's exiled from skies That we might rise , -- From low estate of men Let 's sing him up again !
Parsing [sent. 2512 len. 26]: Each man wind up his heart To bear a part In that angelic choir , and show His glory high , as he was low .
Parsing [sent. 2513 len. 19]: Let 's sing towards men goodwill and charity , Peace upon earth , glory to God on high !
Parsing [sent. 2514 len. 2]: Hallelujah !
Parsing [sent. 2515 len. 2]: Hallelujah !
Parsing [sent. 2516 len. 3]: THE PRAYER .
Parsing [sent. 2517 len. 15]: My soul doth pant towards thee , My God , source of eternal life .
Parsing [sent. 2518 len. 54]: Flesh fights with me : Oh end the strife , And part us , that in peace I may Unclay My wearied spirit , and take My flight to thy eternal spring , Where , for his sake Who is my king , I may wash all my tears away , That day .
Parsing [sent. 2519 len. 62]: Thou conqueror of death , Glorious triumpher o'er the grave , Whose holy breath Was spent to save Lost mankind , make me to be styled Thy child , And take me when I die And go unto my dust ; my soul Above the sky With saints enrol , That in thy arms , for ever , I May lie .
Parsing [sent. 2520 len. 48]: This last is quite regular , that is , the second stanza is arranged precisely as the first , though such will not appear to be the case without examination : the disposition of the lines , so various in length , is confusing though not confused .
Parsing [sent. 2521 len. 30]: In these poems will be found that love of homeliness which is characteristic of all true poets -- and orators too , in as far as they are poets .
Parsing [sent. 2522 len. 11]: The meeting of the homely and the grand is heaven .
Parsing [sent. 2523 len. 3]: One more .
Parsing [sent. 2524 len. 5]: A PRAYER FOR CHARITY .
Parsing [sent. 2525 len. 142]: Full of mercy , full of love , Look upon us from above ; Thou who taught ` st the blind man 's night To entertain a double light , Thine and the day 's -- and that thine too : The lame away his crutches threw ; The parchéd crust of leprosy Returned unto its infancy ; The dumb amazéd was to hear His own unchain 'd tongue strike his ear ; Thy powerful mercy did even chase The devil from his usurpéd place , Where thou thyself shouldst dwell , not he : Oh let thy love our pattern be ; Let thy mercy teach one brother To forgive and love another ; That copying thy mercy here , Thy goodness may hereafter rear Our souls unto thy glory , when Our dust shall cease to be with men .
Parsing [sent. 2526 len. 3]: _ Amen .
Parsing [sent. 2527 len. 4]: _ CHAPTER XVI .
Parsing [sent. 2528 len. 6]: HENRY MORE AND RICHARD BAXTER .
Parsing [sent. 2529 len. 10]: Dr. Henry More was born in the year 1614 .
Parsing [sent. 2530 len. 67]: Chiefly known for his mystical philosophy , which he cultivated in retirement at Cambridge , and taught not only in prose , but in an elaborate , occasionally poetic poem , of somewhere about a thousand Spenserian stanzas , called _ A Platonic Song of the Soul _ , he has left some smaller poems , from which I shall gather good store for my readers .
Parsing [sent. 2531 len. 53]: Whatever may be thought of his theories , they belong at least to the highest order of philosophy ; and it will be seen from the poems I give that they must have borne their part in lifting the soul of the man towards a lofty spiritual condition of faith and fearlessness .
Parsing [sent. 2532 len. 26]: The mystical philosophy seems to me safe enough in the hands of a poet : with others it may degenerate into dank and dusty materialism .
Parsing [sent. 2533 len. 2]: RESOLUTION .
Parsing [sent. 2534 len. 16]: Where 's now the objects of thy fears , Needless sighs , and fruitless tears ?
Parsing [sent. 2535 len. 14]: They be all gone like idle dream Suggested from the body 's steam .
Parsing [sent. 2536 len. 11]: * * * * * What 's plague and prison ?
Parsing [sent. 2537 len. 4]: Loss of friends ?
Parsing [sent. 2538 len. 11]: War , dearth , and death that all things ends ?
Parsing [sent. 2539 len. 14]: Mere bugbears for the childish mind ; Pure panic terrors of the blind .
Parsing [sent. 2540 len. 62]: Collect thy soul unto one sphere Of light , and ` bove the earth it rear ; Those wild scattered thoughts that erst Lay loosely in the world dispersed , Call in : -- thy spirit thus knit in one Fair lucid orb , those fears be gone Like vain impostures of the night , That fly before the morning bright .
Parsing [sent. 2541 len. 57]: Then with pure eyes thou shalt behold How the first goodness doth infold All things in loving tender arms ; That deeméd mischiefs are no harms , But sovereign salves and skilful cures Of greater woes the world endures ; That man 's stout soul may win a state Far raised above the reach of fate .
Parsing [sent. 2542 len. 99]: Then wilt thou say , _ God rules the world _ , Though mountain over mountain hurled Be pitched amid the foaming main Which busy winds to wrath constrain ; * * * * * Though pitchy blasts from hell up-born Stop the outgoings of the morn , And Nature play her fiery games In this forced night , with fulgurant flames : * * * * * All this confusion can not move The purgéd mind , freed from the love Of commerce with her body dear , Cell of sad thoughts , sole spring of fear .
Parsing [sent. 2543 len. 15]: Whate'er I feel or hear or see Threats but these parts that mortal be .
Parsing [sent. 2544 len. 43]: Nought can the honest heart dismay Unless the love of living clay , And long acquaintance with the light Of this outworld , and what to sight Those two officious beams -LSB- 135 -RSB- discover Of forms that round about us hover .
Parsing [sent. 2545 len. 18]: Power , wisdom , goodness , sure did frame This universe , and still guide the same .
Parsing [sent. 2546 len. 10]: But thoughts from passions sprung , deceive Vain mortals .
Parsing [sent. 2547 len. 20]: No man can contrive A better course than what 's been run Since the first circuit of the sun .
Parsing [sent. 2548 len. 32]: He that beholds all from on high Knows better what to do than I. I 'm not mine own : should I repine If he dispose of what 's not mine ?
Parsing [sent. 2549 len. 17]: Purge but thy soul of blind self-will , Thou straight shall see God doth no ill .
Parsing [sent. 2550 len. 13]: The world he fills with the bright rays Of his free goodness .
Parsing [sent. 2551 len. 5]: He displays Himself throughout .
Parsing [sent. 2552 len. 25]: Like common air That spirit of life through all doth fare , Sucked in by them as vital breath That willingly embrace not death .
Parsing [sent. 2553 len. 27]: But those that with that living law Be unacquainted , cares do gnaw ; Mistrust of God 's good providence Doth daily vex their wearied sense .
Parsing [sent. 2554 len. 161]: Now place me on the Libyan soil , With scorching sun and sands to toil , Far from the view of spring or tree , Where neither man nor house I see ; * * * * * Commit me at my next remove To icy Hyperborean ove ; Confine me to the arctic pole , Where the numb 'd heavens do slowly roll ; To lands where cold raw heavy mist Sol 's kindly warmth and light resists ; Where lowering clouds full fraught with snow Do sternly scowl ; where winds do blow With bitter blasts , and pierce the skin , Forcing the vital spirits in , Which leave the body thus ill bested , In this chill plight at least half-dead ; Yet by an antiperistasis -LSB- 136 -RSB- My inward heat more kindled is ; And while this flesh her breath expires , My spirit shall suck celestial fires By deep-fetched sighs and pure devotion .
Parsing [sent. 2555 len. 43]: Thus waxen hot with holy motion , At once I 'll break forth in a flame ; Above this world and worthless fame I 'll take my flight , careless that men Know not how , where I die , or when .
Parsing [sent. 2556 len. 34]: Yea , though the soul should mortal prove , So be God 's life but in me move To my last breath -- I 'm satisfied A lonesome mortal God to have died .
Parsing [sent. 2557 len. 14]: This last paragraph is magnificent as any single passage I know in literature .
Parsing [sent. 2558 len. 41]: Is it lawful , after reading this , to wonder whether Henry More , the retired , and so far untried , student of Cambridge , would have been able thus to meet the alternations of suffering which he imagines ?
Parsing [sent. 2559 len. 18]: It is one thing to see reasonableness , another to be reasonable when objects have become circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 2560 len. 16]: Would he , then , by spiritual might , have risen indeed above bodily torture ?
Parsing [sent. 2561 len. 46]: It is _ possible _ for a man to arrive at this perfection ; it is absolutely _ necessary _ that a man should some day or other reach it ; and I think the wise doctor would have proved the truth of his principles .
Parsing [sent. 2562 len. 29]: But there are many who would gladly part with their whole bodies rather than offend , and could not yet so rise above the invasions of the senses .
Parsing [sent. 2563 len. 41]: Here , as in less important things , our business is not to speculate what we would do in other circumstances , but to perform the duty of the moment , the one true preparation for the duty to come .
Parsing [sent. 2564 len. 31]: Possibly , however , the right development of our human relations in the world may be a more difficult and more important task still than this condition of divine alienation .
Parsing [sent. 2565 len. 28]: To find God in others is better than to grow _ solely _ in the discovery of him in ourselves , if indeed the latter were possible .
Parsing [sent. 2566 len. 2]: DEVOTION .
Parsing [sent. 2567 len. 26]: Good God , when them thy inward grace dost shower Into my breast , How full of light and lively power Is then my soul !
Parsing [sent. 2568 len. 5]: How am I blest !
Parsing [sent. 2569 len. 8]: How can I then all difficulties devour !
Parsing [sent. 2570 len. 13]: Thy might , Thy spright , With ease my cumbrous enemy control .
Parsing [sent. 2571 len. 26]: If thou once turn away thy face and hide Thy cheerful look , My feeble flesh may not abide That dreadful stound ; _ hour .
Parsing [sent. 2572 len. 8]: _ I can not brook Thy absence .
Parsing [sent. 2573 len. 26]: My heart , with care and grief then gride , Doth fail , Doth quail ; My life steals from me at that hidden wound .
Parsing [sent. 2574 len. 27]: My fancy 's then a burden to my mind ; Mine anxious thought Betrays my reason , makes me blind ; Near dangers drad _ dreaded .
Parsing [sent. 2575 len. 29]: _ Make me distraught ; Surprised with fear my senses all I find : In hell I dwell , Oppressed with horror , pain , and sorrow sad .
Parsing [sent. 2576 len. 23]: My former resolutions all are fled -- Slipped over my tongue ; My faith , my hope , and joy are dead .
Parsing [sent. 2577 len. 15]: Assist my heart , Rather than my song , My God , my Saviour !
Parsing [sent. 2578 len. 5]: When I 'm ill-bested .
Parsing [sent. 2579 len. 12]: Stand by , And I Shall bear with courage undeservéd smart .
Parsing [sent. 2580 len. 5]: THE PHILOSOPHER 'S DEVOTION .
Parsing [sent. 2581 len. 3]: Sing aloud !
Parsing [sent. 2582 len. 10]: -- His praise rehearse Who hath made the universe .
Parsing [sent. 2583 len. 17]: He the boundless heavens has spread , All the vital orbs has kned , _ kneaded .
Parsing [sent. 2584 len. 26]: _ He that on Olympus high Tends his flocks with watchful eye , And this eye has multiplied _ suns , as centres of systems .
Parsing [sent. 2585 len. 8]: _ Midst each flock for to reside .
Parsing [sent. 2586 len. 31]: Thus , as round about they stray , Toucheth -LSB- 137 -RSB- each with outstretched ray ; Nimble they hold on their way , Shaping out their night and day .
Parsing [sent. 2587 len. 13]: Summer , winter , autumn , spring , Their inclined axes bring .
Parsing [sent. 2588 len. 13]: Never slack they ; none respires , Dancing round their central fires .
Parsing [sent. 2589 len. 61]: In due order as they move , Echoes sweet be gently drove Thorough heaven 's vast hollowness , Which unto all corners press : Music that the heart of Jove Moves to joy and sportful love ; Fills the listening sailers ' ears Riding on the wandering spheres : Neither speech nor language is Where their voice is not transmiss .
Parsing [sent. 2590 len. 38]: God is good , is wise , is strong , Witness all the creature throng , Is confessed by every tongue ; All things back from whence they sprung , _ go back _ -- a verb .
Parsing [sent. 2591 len. 12]: As the thankful rivers pay What they borrowed of the sea .
Parsing [sent. 2592 len. 15]: Now myself I do resign : Take me whole : I all am thine .
Parsing [sent. 2593 len. 36]: Save me , God , from self-desire -- Death 's pit , dark hell 's raging fire -- -LSB- 138 -RSB- Envy , hatred , vengeance , ire ; Let not lust my soul bemire .
Parsing [sent. 2594 len. 16]: Quit from these , thy praise I 'll sing , Loudly sweep the trembling string .
Parsing [sent. 2595 len. 14]: Bear a part , O Wisdom 's sons , Freed from vain religïons !
Parsing [sent. 2596 len. 2]: Lo !
Parsing [sent. 2597 len. 53]: from far I you salute , Sweetly warbling on my lute -- India , Egypt , Araby , Asia , Greece , and Tartary , Carmel-tracts , and Lebanon , With the Mountains of the Moon , From whence muddy Nile doth run , Or wherever else you won : _ dwell .
Parsing [sent. 2598 len. 14]: _ Breathing in one vital air , One we are though distant far .
Parsing [sent. 2599 len. 26]: Rise at once ; -- let 's sacrifice : Odours sweet perfume the skies ; See how heavenly lightning fires Hearts inflamed with high aspires !
Parsing [sent. 2600 len. 13]: All the substance of our souls Up in clouds of incense rolls .
Parsing [sent. 2601 len. 14]: Leave we nothing to ourselves Save a voice -- what need we else !
Parsing [sent. 2602 len. 14]: Or an hand to wear and tire On the thankful lute or lyre !
Parsing [sent. 2603 len. 3]: Sing aloud !
Parsing [sent. 2604 len. 10]: -- His praise rehearse Who hath made the universe .
Parsing [sent. 2605 len. 23]: In this _ Philosopher 's Devotion _ he has clearly imitated one of those psalms of George Sandys which I have given .
Parsing [sent. 2606 len. 4]: CHARITY AND HUMILITY .
Parsing [sent. 2607 len. 31]: Far have I clambered in my mind , But nought so great as love I find : Deep-searching wit , mount-moving might , Are nought compared to that good sprite .
Parsing [sent. 2608 len. 8]: Life of delight and soul of bliss !
Parsing [sent. 2609 len. 6]: Sure source of lasting happiness !
Parsing [sent. 2610 len. 4]: Higher than heaven !
Parsing [sent. 2611 len. 4]: lower than hell !
Parsing [sent. 2612 len. 5]: What is thy tent ?
Parsing [sent. 2613 len. 7]: Where may ` st thou dwell ?
Parsing [sent. 2614 len. 12]: `` My mansion hight _ Humility _ , _ is named .
Parsing [sent. 2615 len. 6]: _ Heaven 's vastest capability .
Parsing [sent. 2616 len. 31]: The further it doth downward tend , The higher up it doth ascend ; If it go down to utmost nought , It shall return with that it sought . ''
Parsing [sent. 2617 len. 28]: Lord , stretch thy tent in my strait breast ; Enlarge it downward , that sure rest May there be pight for that pure fire _ pitched .
Parsing [sent. 2618 len. 25]: _ Wherewith thou wontest to inspire All self-dead souls : my life is gone ; Sad solitude 's my irksome won ; _ dwelling .
Parsing [sent. 2619 len. 36]: _ Cut off from men and all this world , In Lethe 's lonesome ditch I 'm hurled ; Nor might nor sight doth ought me move , Nor do I care to be above .
Parsing [sent. 2620 len. 20]: O feeble rays of mental light , That best be seen in this dark night , What are you ?
Parsing [sent. 2621 len. 17]: What is any strength If it be not laid in one length With pride or love ?
Parsing [sent. 2622 len. 13]: I nought desire But a new life , or quite to expire .
Parsing [sent. 2623 len. 60]: Could I demolish with mine eye Strong towers , stop the fleet stars in sky , Bring down to earth the pale-faced moon , Or turn black midnight to bright noon ; Though all things were put in my hand -- As parched , as dry as the Libyan sand Would be my life , if charity Were wanting .
Parsing [sent. 2624 len. 56]: But humility Is more than my poor soul durst crave That lies entombed in lowly grave ; But if ` twere lawful up to send My voice to heaven , this should it rend : `` Lord , thrust me deeper into dust , That thou may ` st raise me with the just . ''
Parsing [sent. 2625 len. 11]: There are strange things and worth pondering in all these .
Parsing [sent. 2626 len. 19]: An occasional classical allusion seems to us quite out of place , but such things we must pass .
Parsing [sent. 2627 len. 12]: The poems are quite different from any we have had before .
Parsing [sent. 2628 len. 35]: There has been only a few of such writers in our nation , but I suspect those have had a good deal more influence upon the religious life of it than many thinkers suppose .
Parsing [sent. 2629 len. 19]: They are in closest sympathy with the deeper forms of truth employed by St. Paul and St. John .
Parsing [sent. 2630 len. 18]: This last poem , concerning humility as the house in which charity dwells , is very truth .
Parsing [sent. 2631 len. 42]: A repentant sinner feels that he is making himself little when he prays to be made humble : the Christian philosopher sees such a glory and spiritual wealth in humility that it appears to him almost too much to pray for .
Parsing [sent. 2632 len. 14]: The very essence of these mystical writers seems to me to be poetry .
Parsing [sent. 2633 len. 25]: They use the largest figures for the largest spiritual ideas -- _ light _ for _ good , darkness _ for _ evil _ .
Parsing [sent. 2634 len. 11]: Such symbols are the true bodies of the true ideas .
Parsing [sent. 2635 len. 32]: For this service mainly what we term _ nature _ was called into being , namely , to furnish forms for truths , for without form truth can not be uttered .
Parsing [sent. 2636 len. 21]: Having found their symbols , these writers next proceed to use them logically ; and here begins the peculiar danger .
Parsing [sent. 2637 len. 55]: When the logic leaves the poetry behind , it grows first presumptuous , then hard , then narrow and untrue to the original breadth of the symbol ; the glory of the symbol vanishes ; and the final result is a worship of the symbol , which has withered into an apple of Sodom .
Parsing [sent. 2638 len. 30]: Witness some of the writings of the European master of the order -- Swedenborg : the highest of them are rich in truth ; the lowest are poverty-stricken indeed .
Parsing [sent. 2639 len. 24]: In 1615 was born Richard Baxter , one of the purest and wisest and devoutest of men -- and no mean poet either .
Parsing [sent. 2640 len. 34]: If ever a man sought between contending parties to do his duty , siding with each as each appeared right , opposing each as each appeared wrong , surely that man was Baxter .
Parsing [sent. 2641 len. 21]: Hence he fared as all men too wise to be partisans must fare -- he pleased neither Royalists nor Puritans .
Parsing [sent. 2642 len. 40]: Dull of heart and sadly unlike a mother was the Church when , by the Act of Uniformity of Charles II. , she drove from her bosom such a son , with his two thousand brethren of the clergy !
Parsing [sent. 2643 len. 29]: He has left us a good deal of verse -- too much , perhaps , if we consider the length of the poems and the value of condensation .
Parsing [sent. 2644 len. 38]: There is in many of them a delightful fervour of the simplest love to God , uttered with a plain half poetic , half logical strength , from which sometimes the poetry breaks out clear and fine .
Parsing [sent. 2645 len. 35]: Much that he writes is of death , from the dread of which he evidently suffered -- a good thing when it drives a man to renew his confidence in his Saviour 's presence .
Parsing [sent. 2646 len. 20]: It has with him a very different origin from the vulgar fancy that to talk about death is religious .
Parsing [sent. 2647 len. 26]: It was refuge from the fear of death he sought , and that is the part of every man who would not be a slave .
Parsing [sent. 2648 len. 24]: The _ door of death _ of which he so often speaks is to him a door out of the fear of death .
Parsing [sent. 2649 len. 52]: The poem from which the following excerpt is made was evidently written in view of some imminent suffering for conscience-sake , probably when the Act of Uniformity was passed : twenty years after , he was imprisoned at the age of sixty-seven , and lay nearly a year and a half .
Parsing [sent. 2650 len. 6]: -- I omit many verses .
Parsing [sent. 2651 len. 3]: THE RESOLUTION .
Parsing [sent. 2652 len. 32]: It 's no great matter what men deem , Whether they count me good or bad : In their applause and best esteem , There 's no contentment to be had .
Parsing [sent. 2653 len. 36]: Thy steps , Lord , in this dirt I see ; And lest my soul from God should stray , I 'll bear my cross and follow thee : Let others choose the fairer way .
Parsing [sent. 2654 len. 32]: My face is meeter for the spit ; I am more suitable to shame , And to the taunts of scornful wit : It 's no great matter for my name .
Parsing [sent. 2655 len. 33]: My Lord hath taught me how to want A place wherein to put my head : While he is mine , I 'll be content To beg or lack my daily bread .
Parsing [sent. 2656 len. 15]: Must I forsake the soil and air Where first I drew my vital breath ?
Parsing [sent. 2657 len. 18]: That way may be as near and fair : Thence I may come to thee by death .
Parsing [sent. 2658 len. 35]: All countries are my Father 's lands ; Thy sun , thy love , doth shine on all ; We may in all lift up pure hands , And with acceptance on thee call .
Parsing [sent. 2659 len. 8]: What if in prison I must dwell ?
Parsing [sent. 2660 len. 8]: May I not there converse with thee ?
Parsing [sent. 2661 len. 21]: Save me from sin , thy wrath , and hell , Call me thy child , and I am free .
Parsing [sent. 2662 len. 30]: No walls or bars can keep thee out ; None can confine a holy soul ; The streets of heaven it walks about ; None can its liberty control .
Parsing [sent. 2663 len. 19]: This flesh hath drawn my soul to sin : If it must smart , thy will be done !
Parsing [sent. 2664 len. 17]: O fill me with thy joys within , And then I 'll let it grieve alone .
Parsing [sent. 2665 len. 33]: Frail , sinful flesh is loath to die ; Sense to the unseen world is strange ; The doubting soul dreads the Most High , And trembleth at so great a change .
Parsing [sent. 2666 len. 31]: O let me not be strange at home , Strange to the sun and life of souls , Choosing this low and darkened room , Familiar with worms and moles !
Parsing [sent. 2667 len. 9]: Am I the first that go this way ?
Parsing [sent. 2668 len. 7]: How many saints are gone before !
Parsing [sent. 2669 len. 12]: How many enter every day Into thy kingdom by this door !
Parsing [sent. 2670 len. 33]: Christ was once dead , and in a grave ; Yet conquered death , and rose again ; And by this method he will save His servants that with him shall reign .
Parsing [sent. 2671 len. 29]: The strangeness will be quickly over , When once the heaven-born soul is there : One sight of God will it recover From all this backwardness and fear .
Parsing [sent. 2672 len. 35]: To us , Christ 's lowest parts , his feet , Union and faith must yet suffice To guide and comfort us : it 's meet We trust our head who hath our eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2673 len. 25]: We see here that faith in the Lord leads Richard Baxter to the same conclusions immediately to which his faithful philosophy led Henry More .
Parsing [sent. 2674 len. 19]: There is much in Baxter 's poems that I would gladly quote , but must leave with regret .
Parsing [sent. 2675 len. 22]: Here is a curious , skilful , and , in a homely way , poetic ballad , embodying a good parable .
Parsing [sent. 2676 len. 9]: I give only a few of the stanzas .
Parsing [sent. 2677 len. 3]: THE RETURN .
Parsing [sent. 2678 len. 26]: Who was it that I left behind When I went last from home , That now I all disordered find When to myself I come ?
Parsing [sent. 2679 len. 32]: I left it light , but now all 's dark , And I am fain to grope : Were it not for one little spark I should be out of hope .
Parsing [sent. 2680 len. 29]: My Gospel-book I open left , Where I the promise saw ; But now I doubt it 's lost by theft : I find none but the Law .
Parsing [sent. 2681 len. 24]: The stormy rain an entrance hath Through the uncovered top : How should I rest when showers of wrath Upon my conscience drop ?
Parsing [sent. 2682 len. 32]: I locked my jewel in my chest ; I 'll search lest that be gone : -- If this one guest had quit my breast , I had been quite undone .
Parsing [sent. 2683 len. 30]: My treacherous Flesh had played its part , And opened Sin the door ; And they have spoiled and robbed my heart , And left it sad and poor .
Parsing [sent. 2684 len. 26]: Yet have I one great trusty friend That will procure my peace , And all this loss and ruin mend , And purchase my release .
Parsing [sent. 2685 len. 30]: The bellows I 'll yet take in hand , Till this small spark shall flame : Love shall my heart and tongue command To praise God 's holy name .
Parsing [sent. 2686 len. 33]: I 'll mend the roof ; I 'll watch the door , And better keep the key ; I 'll trust my treacherous flesh no more , But force it to obey .
Parsing [sent. 2687 len. 5]: What have I said ?
Parsing [sent. 2688 len. 25]: That I 'll do this That am so false and weak , And have so often done amiss , And did my covenants break ?
Parsing [sent. 2689 len. 32]: I mean , Lord -- all this shall be done If thou my heart wilt raise ; And as the work must be thine own , So also shall the praise .
Parsing [sent. 2690 len. 57]: The allegory is so good that one is absolutely sorry when it breaks down , and the poem says in plain words that which is the subject of the figures , bringing truths unmasked into the midst of the maskers who represent truths -- thus interrupting the pleasure of the artistic sense in the transparent illusion .
Parsing [sent. 2691 len. 11]: The command of metrical form in Baxter is somewhat remarkable .
Parsing [sent. 2692 len. 17]: He has not much melody , but he keeps good time in a variety of measures .
Parsing [sent. 2693 len. 3]: CHAPTER XVII .
Parsing [sent. 2694 len. 4]: CRASHAW AND MARVELL .
Parsing [sent. 2695 len. 15]: I come now to one of the loveliest of our angel-birds , Richard Crashaw .
Parsing [sent. 2696 len. 42]: Indeed he was like a bird in more senses than one ; for he belongs to that class of men who seem hardly ever to get foot-hold of this world , but are ever floating in the upper air of it .
Parsing [sent. 2697 len. 72]: What I said of a peculiar Æolian word-music in William Drummond applies with equal truth to Crashaw ; while of our own poets , somehow or other , he reminds me of Shelley , in the silvery shine and bell-like melody both of his verse and his imagery ; and in one of his poems , _ Music 's Duel _ , the fineness of his phrase reminds me of Keats .
Parsing [sent. 2698 len. 24]: But I must not forget that it is only with his sacred , his best poems too , that I am now concerned .
Parsing [sent. 2699 len. 25]: The date of his birth is not known with certainty , but it is judged about 1616 , the year of Shakspere 's death .
Parsing [sent. 2700 len. 13]: He was the son of a Protestant clergyman zealous even to controversy .
Parsing [sent. 2701 len. 43]: By a not unnatural reaction Crashaw , by that time , it is said , a popular preacher , when expelled from Oxford in 1644 by the Puritan Parliament because of his refusal to sign their Covenant , became a Roman Catholic .
Parsing [sent. 2702 len. 16]: He died about the age of thirty-four , a canon of the Church of Loretto .
Parsing [sent. 2703 len. 27]: There is much in his verses of that sentimentalism which , I have already said in speaking of Southwell , is rife in modern Catholic poetry .
Parsing [sent. 2704 len. 13]: I will give from Crashaw a specimen of the kind of it .
Parsing [sent. 2705 len. 34]: Avoiding a more sacred object , one stanza from a poem of thirty-one , most musical , and full of lovely speech concerning the tears of Mary Magdalen , will suit my purpose .
Parsing [sent. 2706 len. 10]: Hail , sister springs , Parents of silver-footed rills !
Parsing [sent. 2707 len. 3]: Ever-bubbling things !
Parsing [sent. 2708 len. 3]: Thawing crystal !
Parsing [sent. 2709 len. 9]: Snowy hills , Still spending , never spent !
Parsing [sent. 2710 len. 10]: -- I mean Thy fair eyes , sweet Magdalene !
Parsing [sent. 2711 len. 16]: The poem is called _ The Weeper _ , and is radiant of delicate fancy .
Parsing [sent. 2712 len. 19]: But surely such tones are not worthy of flitting moth-like about the holy sorrow of a repentant woman !
Parsing [sent. 2713 len. 10]: Fantastically beautiful , they but play with her grief .
Parsing [sent. 2714 len. 15]: Sorrow herself would put her shoes off her feet in approaching the weeping Magdalene .
Parsing [sent. 2715 len. 14]: They make much of her indeed , but they show her little reverence .
Parsing [sent. 2716 len. 29]: There is in them , notwithstanding their fervour of amorous words , a coldness like that which dwells in the ghostly beauty of icicles shining in the moon .
Parsing [sent. 2717 len. 10]: But I almost reproach myself for introducing Crashaw thus .
Parsing [sent. 2718 len. 37]: I had to point out the fact , and now having done with it , I could heartily wish I had room to expatiate on his loveliness even in such poems as _ The Weeper _ .
Parsing [sent. 2719 len. 38]: His _ Divine Epigrams _ are not the most beautiful , but they are to me the most valuable of his verses , inasmuch as they make us feel afresh the truth which he sets forth anew .
Parsing [sent. 2720 len. 25]: In them some of the facts of our Lord 's life and teaching look out upon us as from clear windows of the past .
Parsing [sent. 2721 len. 14]: As epigrams , too , they are excellent -- pointed as a lance .
Parsing [sent. 2722 len. 8]: _ Upon the Sepulchre of our Lord .
Parsing [sent. 2723 len. 17]: _ Here , where our Lord once laid his head , Now the grave lies buriëd .
Parsing [sent. 2724 len. 6]: _ The Widow 's Mites .
Parsing [sent. 2725 len. 43]: _ Two mites , two drops , yet all her house and land , Fall from a steady heart , though trembling hand ; The other 's wanton wealth foams high and brave : The other cast away -- she only gave .
Parsing [sent. 2726 len. 5]: _ On the Prodigal .
Parsing [sent. 2727 len. 7]: _ Tell me , bright boy !
Parsing [sent. 2728 len. 7]: tell me , my golden lad !
Parsing [sent. 2729 len. 5]: Whither away so frolic ?
Parsing [sent. 2730 len. 4]: Why so glad ?
Parsing [sent. 2731 len. 2]: What !
Parsing [sent. 2732 len. 8]: _ all _ thy wealth in council ?
Parsing [sent. 2733 len. 6]: _ all _ thy state ?
Parsing [sent. 2734 len. 5]: Are husks so dear ?
Parsing [sent. 2735 len. 8]: Troth , 't is a mighty rate !
Parsing [sent. 2736 len. 9]: I value the following as a lovely parable .
Parsing [sent. 2737 len. 13]: Mary is not contented : to see the place is little comfort .
Parsing [sent. 2738 len. 30]: The church itself , with all its memories of the Lord , the gospel-story , and all theory about him , is but his tomb until we find himself .
Parsing [sent. 2739 len. 10]: _ Come , see the place-where the Lord lay .
Parsing [sent. 2740 len. 10]: _ Show me himself , himself , bright sir !
Parsing [sent. 2741 len. 12]: Oh show Which way my poor tears to himself may go .
Parsing [sent. 2742 len. 51]: Were it enough to show the place , and say , `` Look , Mary ; here see where thy Lord once lay ; '' Then could I show these arms of mine , and say , `` Look , Mary ; here see where thy Lord once lay . ''
Parsing [sent. 2743 len. 34]: From one of eight lines , on the Mother Mary looking on her child in her lap , I take the last two , complete in themselves , and I think best alone .
Parsing [sent. 2744 len. 29]: This new guest to her eyes new laws hath given : 'T was once _ look up _ , 't is now _ look down to heaven _ .
Parsing [sent. 2745 len. 7]: And here is perhaps his best .
Parsing [sent. 2746 len. 11]: _ Two went up into the Temple to pray _ .
Parsing [sent. 2747 len. 5]: Two went to pray ?
Parsing [sent. 2748 len. 14]: Oh rather say , One went to brag , the other to pray .
Parsing [sent. 2749 len. 19]: One stands up close , and treads on high , Where the other dares not lend his eye .
Parsing [sent. 2750 len. 16]: One nearer to God 's altar trod ; The other to the altar 's God .
Parsing [sent. 2751 len. 6]: This appears to me perfect .
Parsing [sent. 2752 len. 14]: Here is the true relation between the forms and the end of religion .
Parsing [sent. 2753 len. 20]: The priesthood , the altar and all its ceremonies , must vanish from between the sinner and his God .
Parsing [sent. 2754 len. 46]: When the priest forgets his mediation of a servant , his duty of a door-keeper to the temple of truth , and takes upon him the office of an intercessor , he stands between man and God , and is a Satan , an adversary .
Parsing [sent. 2755 len. 10]: Artistically considered , the poem could hardly be improved .
Parsing [sent. 2756 len. 8]: Here is another containing a similar lesson .
Parsing [sent. 2757 len. 13]: _ I am not worthy that thou shouldst come under my roof .
Parsing [sent. 2758 len. 19]: _ Thy God was making haste into thy roof ; Thy humble faith and fear keeps him aloof .
Parsing [sent. 2759 len. 20]: He 'll be thy guest : because he may not be , He 'll come -- into thy house ?
Parsing [sent. 2760 len. 5]: No ; into thee .
Parsing [sent. 2761 len. 15]: The following is a world-wide intercession for them that know not what they do .
Parsing [sent. 2762 len. 20]: Of those that reject the truth , who can be said ever to have _ truly _ seen it ?
Parsing [sent. 2763 len. 9]: A man must be good to see truth .
Parsing [sent. 2764 len. 23]: It is a thought suggested by our Lord 's words , not an irreverent opposition to the truth of _ them _ .
Parsing [sent. 2765 len. 9]: _ But now they have seen and hated .
Parsing [sent. 2766 len. 4]: _ _ Seen ?
Parsing [sent. 2767 len. 7]: _ and yet _ hated thee ?
Parsing [sent. 2768 len. 17]: _ They did not see -- They saw thee not , that saw and hated thee !
Parsing [sent. 2769 len. 12]: No , no ; they saw thee not , O Life !
Parsing [sent. 2770 len. 3]: O Love !
Parsing [sent. 2771 len. 11]: Who saw aught in thee that their hate could move .
Parsing [sent. 2772 len. 26]: We must not be too ready to quarrel with every oddity : an oddity will sometimes just give the start to an outbreak of song .
Parsing [sent. 2773 len. 11]: The strangeness of the following hymn rises almost into grandeur .
Parsing [sent. 2774 len. 3]: EASTER DAY .
Parsing [sent. 2775 len. 45]: Rise , heir of fresh eternity , From thy virgin-tomb ; Rise , mighty man of wonders , and thy world with thee ; Thy tomb , the universal East -- Nature 's new womb ; Thy tomb -- fair Immortality 's perfumed nest .
Parsing [sent. 2776 len. 51]: Of all the glories -LSB- 139 -RSB- make noon gay This is the morn ; This rock buds forth the fountain of the streams of day ; In joy 's white annals lives this hour , When life was born , No cloud-scowl on his radiant lids , no tempest-lower .
Parsing [sent. 2777 len. 25]: Life , by this light 's nativity , All creatures have ; Death only by this day 's just doom is forced to die .
Parsing [sent. 2778 len. 25]: Nor is death forced ; for , may he lie Throned in thy grave , Death will on this condition be content to die .
Parsing [sent. 2779 len. 73]: When we come , in the writings of one who has revealed masterdom , upon any passage that seems commonplace , or any figure that suggests nothing true , the part of wisdom is to brood over that point ; for the probability is that the barrenness lies in us , two factors being necessary for the result of sight -- the thing to be seen and the eye to see it .
Parsing [sent. 2780 len. 27]: No doubt the expression may be inadequate , but if we can compensate the deficiency by adding more vision , so much the better for us .
Parsing [sent. 2781 len. 26]: In the second stanza there is a strange combination of images : the rock buds ; and buds a fountain ; the fountain is light .
Parsing [sent. 2782 len. 36]: But the images are so much one at the root , that they slide gracefully into each other , and there is no confusion or incongruity : the result is an inclined plane of development .
Parsing [sent. 2783 len. 19]: I now come to the most musical and most graceful , therefore most lyrical , of his poems .
Parsing [sent. 2784 len. 38]: I have left out just three stanzas , because of the sentimentalism of which I have spoken : I would have left out more if I could have done so without spoiling the symmetry of the poem .
Parsing [sent. 2785 len. 61]: My reader must be friendly enough to one who is so friendly to him , to let his peculiarities pass unquestioned -- amongst the rest his conceits , as well as the trifling discord that the shepherds should be called , after the classical fashion -- ill agreeing , from its associations , with Christian song -- Tityrus and Thyrsis .
Parsing [sent. 2786 len. 10]: A HYMN OF THE NATIVITY SUNG BY THE SHEPHERDS .
Parsing [sent. 2787 len. 4]: _ Chorus _ .
Parsing [sent. 2788 len. 36]: Come , we shepherds , whose blest sight Hath met love 's noon in nature 's night ; Come , lift we up our loftier song , And wake the sun that lies too long .
Parsing [sent. 2789 len. 52]: To all our world of well-stolen -LSB- 140 -RSB- joy He slept , and dreamed of no such thing , While we found out heaven 's fairer eye , And kissed the cradle of our king : Tell him he rises now too late To show us aught worth looking at .
Parsing [sent. 2790 len. 52]: Tell him we now can show him more Than he e'er showed to mortal sight -- Than he himself e'er saw before , Which to be seen needs not his light : Tell him , Tityrus , where thou hast been ; Tell him , Thyrsis , what thou hast seen .
Parsing [sent. 2791 len. 4]: _ Tityrus _ .
Parsing [sent. 2792 len. 28]: Gloomy night embraced the place Where the noble infant lay : The babe looked up and showed his face : In spite of darkness it was day .
Parsing [sent. 2793 len. 20]: It was thy day , sweet , and did rise Not from the east , but from thy eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2794 len. 3]: _ Chorus .
Parsing [sent. 2795 len. 14]: _ It was thy day , sweet , & c. _ Thyrsis _ .
Parsing [sent. 2796 len. 28]: Winter chid aloud , and sent The angry north to wage his wars : The north forgot his fierce intent , And left perfumes instead of scars .
Parsing [sent. 2797 len. 17]: By those sweet eyes ' persuasive powers , Where he meant frosts , he scattered flowers .
Parsing [sent. 2798 len. 3]: _ Chorus .
Parsing [sent. 2799 len. 13]: _ By those sweet eyes ' , & c. _ Both _ .
Parsing [sent. 2800 len. 31]: We saw thee in thy balmy nest , Young dawn of our eternal day ; We saw thine eyes break from the east , And chase the trembling shades away .
Parsing [sent. 2801 len. 19]: We saw thee , and we blessed the sight ; We saw thee by thine own sweet light .
Parsing [sent. 2802 len. 3]: _ Chorus .
Parsing [sent. 2803 len. 11]: _ We saw thee , & c. _ Tityrus _ .
Parsing [sent. 2804 len. 19]: `` Poor world , '' said I , `` what wilt thou do To entertain this starry stranger ?
Parsing [sent. 2805 len. 16]: Is this the best thou canst bestow -- A cold and not too cleanly manger ?
Parsing [sent. 2806 len. 19]: Contend , the powers of heaven and earth , To fit a bed for this huge birth . ''
Parsing [sent. 2807 len. 3]: _ Chorus .
Parsing [sent. 2808 len. 12]: _ Contend , the powers , & c. _ Thyrsis _ .
Parsing [sent. 2809 len. 35]: `` Proud world , '' said I , `` cease your contest , And let the mighty babe alone : The phoenix builds the phoenix ' nest -- Love 's architecture is his own .
Parsing [sent. 2810 len. 19]: The babe , whose birth embraves this morn , Made his own bed ere he was born . ''
Parsing [sent. 2811 len. 3]: _ Chorus .
Parsing [sent. 2812 len. 13]: _ The babe , whose birth , & c. _ Tityrus _ .
Parsing [sent. 2813 len. 58]: I saw the curl 'd drops , soft and slow , Come hovering o'er the place 's head , Offering their whitest sheets of snow To furnish the fair infant 's bed : `` Forbear , '' said I ; `` be not too bold : Your fleece is white , but 't is too cold . ''
Parsing [sent. 2814 len. 3]: _ Chorus .
Parsing [sent. 2815 len. 14]: _ `` Forbear , '' said I , & c. _ Thyrsis _ .
Parsing [sent. 2816 len. 28]: I saw the obsequious seraphim Their rosy fleece of fire bestow ; For well they now can spare their wings , Since heaven itself lies here below .
Parsing [sent. 2817 len. 25]: `` Well done , '' said I ; `` but are you sure Your down , so warm , will pass for pure ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2818 len. 3]: _ Chorus .
Parsing [sent. 2819 len. 21]: _ `` Well done , '' said I , & c. * * * * * _ Full Chorus _ .
Parsing [sent. 2820 len. 7]: Welcome all wonders in one sight !
Parsing [sent. 2821 len. 6]: Eternity shut in a span !
Parsing [sent. 2822 len. 4]: Summer in winter !
Parsing [sent. 2823 len. 4]: day in night !
Parsing [sent. 2824 len. 9]: Heaven in earth , and God in man !
Parsing [sent. 2825 len. 17]: Great little one , whose all-embracing birth Lifts earth to heaven , stoops heaven to earth !
Parsing [sent. 2826 len. 54]: * * * * * Welcome -- though not to those gay flies Gilded i ' th ' beams of earthly kings -- Slippery souls in smiling eyes -- But to poor shepherds , homespun things , Whose wealth 's their flocks , whose wit 's to be Well read in their simplicity .
Parsing [sent. 2827 len. 39]: Yet when young April 's husband showers Shall bless the fruitful Maia 's bed , We 'll bring the firstborn of her flowers To kiss thy feet , and crown thy head : To thee , dear Lamb !
Parsing [sent. 2828 len. 12]: whose love must keep The shepherds while they feed their sheep .
Parsing [sent. 2829 len. 30]: To thee , meek Majesty , soft king Of simple graces and sweet loves , Each of us his lamb will bring , Each his pair of silver doves .
Parsing [sent. 2830 len. 17]: At last , in fire of thy fair eyes , Ourselves become our own best sacrifice .
Parsing [sent. 2831 len. 7]: A splendid line to end with !
Parsing [sent. 2832 len. 7]: too good for the preceding one .
Parsing [sent. 2833 len. 19]: All temples and altars , all priesthoods and prayers , must vanish in this one and only sacrifice .
Parsing [sent. 2834 len. 19]: Exquisite , however , as the poem is , we can not help wishing it looked less heathenish .
Parsing [sent. 2835 len. 6]: Its decorations are certainly meretricious .
Parsing [sent. 2836 len. 34]: From a few religious poems of Sir Edward Sherburne , another Roman Catholic , and a firm adherent of Charles I. , I choose the following -- the only one I care for .
Parsing [sent. 2837 len. 8]: AND THEY LAID HIM IN A MANGER .
Parsing [sent. 2838 len. 18]: Happy crib , that wert , alone , To my God , bed , cradle , throne !
Parsing [sent. 2839 len. 28]: Whilst thy glorious vileness I View with divine fancy 's eye , Sordid filth seems all the cost , State , and splendour , crowns do boast .
Parsing [sent. 2840 len. 23]: See heaven 's sacred majesty Humbled beneath poverty ; Swaddled up in homely rags , On a bed of straw and flags !
Parsing [sent. 2841 len. 26]: He whose hands the heavens displayed , And the world 's foundations laid , From the world 's almost exiled , Of all ornaments despoiled .
Parsing [sent. 2842 len. 26]: Perfumes bathe him not , new-born ; Persian mantles not adorn ; Nor do the rich roofs look bright With the jasper 's orient light .
Parsing [sent. 2843 len. 26]: Where , O royal infant , be The ensigns of thy majesty ; Thy Sire 's equalizing state ; And thy sceptre that rules fate ?
Parsing [sent. 2844 len. 23]: Where 's thy angel-guarded throne , Whence thy laws thou didst make known -- Laws which heaven , earth , hell obeyed ?
Parsing [sent. 2845 len. 4]: These , ah !
Parsing [sent. 2846 len. 16]: these aside he laid ; Would the emblem be -- of pride By humility outvied .
Parsing [sent. 2847 len. 44]: I pass by Abraham Cowley , mighty reputation as he has had , without further remark than that he is too vulgar to be admired more than occasionally , and too artificial almost to be , as a poet , loved at all .
Parsing [sent. 2848 len. 24]: Andrew Marvell , member of Parliament for Hull both before and after the Restoration , was twelve years younger than his friend Milton .
Parsing [sent. 2849 len. 22]: Any one of some half-dozen of his few poems is to my mind worth all the verse that Cowley ever made .
Parsing [sent. 2850 len. 25]: It is a pity he wrote so little ; but his was a life as diligent , I presume , as it was honourable .
Parsing [sent. 2851 len. 6]: ON A DROP OF DEW .
Parsing [sent. 2852 len. 42]: See how the orient dew , Shed from the bosom of the morn Into the blowing roses , Yet careless of its mansion new For the clear region where 't was born , Round in itself encloses , _ used intransitively .
Parsing [sent. 2853 len. 17]: _ And in its little globe 's extent , Frames as it can its native element .
Parsing [sent. 2854 len. 70]: How it the purple flower does slight , Scarce touching where it lies , But gazing back upon the skies , Shines with a mournful light , Like its own tear , Because so long divided from the sphere : Restless it rolls , and unsecure , Trembling lest it grow impure , Till the warm sun pity its pain , And to the skies exhale it back again .
Parsing [sent. 2855 len. 65]: So the soul , that drop , that ray Of the clear fountain of eternal day , Could it within the human flower be seen , Remembering still its former height , Shuns the sweet leaves and blossoms green ; And , recollecting its own light , Does , in its pure and circling thoughts , express The greater heaven in an heaven less .
Parsing [sent. 2856 len. 38]: In how coy a figure wound , Every way it turns away , So the world excluding round , Yet receiving in the day ; Dark beneath but bright above , Here disdaining , there in love .
Parsing [sent. 2857 len. 8]: How loose and easy hence to go !
Parsing [sent. 2858 len. 7]: How girt and ready to ascend !
Parsing [sent. 2859 len. 14]: Moving but on a point below , It all about does upwards bend .
Parsing [sent. 2860 len. 39]: Such did the manna 's sacred dew distil -- White and entire , -LSB- 141 -RSB- though congealed and chill -- Congealed on earth , but does , dissolving , run Into the glories of the almighty sun .
Parsing [sent. 2861 len. 28]: Surely a lovely fancy of resemblance , exquisitely wrought out ; an instance of the lighter play of the mystical mind , which yet shadows forth truth .
Parsing [sent. 2862 len. 3]: THE CORONET .
Parsing [sent. 2863 len. 99]: When for the thorns with which I long too long , With many a piercing wound , My Saviour 's head have crowned , I seek with garlands to redress that wrong , Through every garden , every mead I gather flowers -- my fruits are only flowers -- Dismantling all the fragrant towers That once adorned my shepherdess 's head ; And now , when I have summed up all my store , Thinking -- so I myself deceive -- So rich a chaplet thence to weave As never yet the King of glory wore ; Alas !
Parsing [sent. 2864 len. 28]: I find the serpent old , That , twining in his speckled breast , About the flowers disguised does fold , With wreaths of fame and interest .
Parsing [sent. 2865 len. 17]: Ah , foolish man that wouldst debase with them And mortal glory , heaven 's diadem !
Parsing [sent. 2866 len. 81]: But thou who only couldst the serpent tame , Either his slippery knots at once untie , And disentangle all his winding snare , Or shatter too with him my curious frame , -LSB- 142 -RSB- And let these wither , that so he may die , Though set with skill , and chosen out with care ; That they , while thou on both their spoils dost tread , May crown thy feet that could not crown thy head .
Parsing [sent. 2867 len. 13]: A true sacrifice of worship , if not a garland of praise !
Parsing [sent. 2868 len. 35]: The disciple would have his works tried by the fire , not only that the gold and the precious stones may emerge relucent , but that the wood and hay and stubble may perish .
Parsing [sent. 2869 len. 17]: The will of God alone , not what we may have effected , deserves our care .
Parsing [sent. 2870 len. 22]: In the perishing of our deeds they fall at his feet : in our willing their loss we crown his head .
Parsing [sent. 2871 len. 3]: CHAPTER XVIII .
Parsing [sent. 2872 len. 8]: A MOUNT OF VISION -- HENRY VAUGHAN .
Parsing [sent. 2873 len. 31]: We have now arrived at the borders of a long , dreary tract , which , happily for my readers , I can shorten for them in this my retrospect .
Parsing [sent. 2874 len. 33]: From the heights of Henry Vaughan 's verse , I look across a stony region , with a few feeble oases scattered over it , and a hazy green in the distance .
Parsing [sent. 2875 len. 26]: It does not soften the dreariness that its stones are all laid in order , that the spaces which should be meadows are skilfully paved .
Parsing [sent. 2876 len. 15]: Henry Vaughan belongs to the mystical school , but his poetry rules his theories .
Parsing [sent. 2877 len. 27]: You find no more of the mystic than the poet can easily govern ; in fact , scarcely more than is necessary to the highest poetry .
Parsing [sent. 2878 len. 19]: He develops his mysticism upwards , with relation to his higher nature alone : it blossoms into poetry .
Parsing [sent. 2879 len. 41]: His twin-brother Thomas developed his mysticism downwards in the direction of the material sciences -- a true effort still , but one in which the danger of ceasing to be true increases with increasing ratio the further it is carried .
Parsing [sent. 2880 len. 11]: They were born in South Wales in the year 1621 .
Parsing [sent. 2881 len. 11]: Thomas was a clergyman ; Henry a doctor of medicine .
Parsing [sent. 2882 len. 22]: Both were Royalists , and both suffered in the cause -- Thomas by expulsion from his living , Henry by imprisonment .
Parsing [sent. 2883 len. 12]: Thomas died soon after the Restoration ; Henry outlived the Revolution .
Parsing [sent. 2884 len. 19]: Henry Vaughan was then nearly thirty years younger than George Herbert , whom he consciously and intentionally imitates .
Parsing [sent. 2885 len. 40]: His art is not comparable to that of Herbert : hence Herbert remains the master ; for it is not the thought that makes the poet ; it is the utterance of that thought in worthy presence of speech .
Parsing [sent. 2886 len. 7]: He is careless and somewhat rugged .
Parsing [sent. 2887 len. 31]: If he can get his thought dressed , and thus made visible , he does not mind the dress fitting awkwardly , or even being a little out at elbows .
Parsing [sent. 2888 len. 13]: And yet he has grander lines and phrases than any in Herbert .
Parsing [sent. 2889 len. 12]: He has occasionally a daring success that strikes one with astonishment .
Parsing [sent. 2890 len. 18]: In a word , he says more splendid things than Herbert , though he writes inferior poems .
Parsing [sent. 2891 len. 23]: His thought is profound and just ; the harmonies in his soul are true ; its artistic and musical ear is defective .
Parsing [sent. 2892 len. 9]: His movements are sometimes grand , sometimes awkward .
Parsing [sent. 2893 len. 18]: Herbert is always gracious -- I use the word as meaning much more than _ graceful _ .
Parsing [sent. 2894 len. 15]: The following poem will instance Vaughan 's fine mysticism and odd embodiment : COCK-CROWING .
Parsing [sent. 2895 len. 4]: Father of lights !
Parsing [sent. 2896 len. 15]: what sunny seed , What glance of day hast thou confined Into this bird ?
Parsing [sent. 2897 len. 24]: To all the breed This busy ray thou hast assigned ; Their magnetism works all night , And dreams of Paradise and light .
Parsing [sent. 2898 len. 54]: Their eyes watch for the morning hue ; Their little grain , -LSB- 143 -RSB- expelling night , So shines and sings , as if it knew The path unto the house of light : It seems their candle , howe'er done , Was tined -LSB- 144 -RSB- and lighted at the sun .
Parsing [sent. 2899 len. 30]: If such a tincture , such a touch , So firm a longing can empower , Shall thy own image think it much To watch for thy appearing hour ?
Parsing [sent. 2900 len. 17]: If a mere blast so fill the sail , Shall not the breath of God prevail ?
Parsing [sent. 2901 len. 32]: O thou immortal Light and Heat , Whose hand so shines through all this frame , That by the beauty of the seat , We plainly see who made the same !
Parsing [sent. 2902 len. 17]: Seeing thy seed abides in me , Dwell thou in it , and I in thee .
Parsing [sent. 2903 len. 82]: To sleep without thee is to die ; Yea , 't is a death partakes of hell ; For where thou dost not close the eye , It never opens , I can tell : In such a dark , Egyptian border The shades of death dwell and disorder Its joys and hopes and earnest throws , And hearts whose pulse beats still for light , Are given to birds , who but thee knows A love-sick soul 's exalted flight ?
Parsing [sent. 2904 len. 16]: Can souls be tracked by any eye But his who gave them wings to fly ?
Parsing [sent. 2905 len. 35]: Only this veil , which thou hast broke , And must be broken yet in me ; This veil , I say , is all the cloak And cloud which shadows me from thee .
Parsing [sent. 2906 len. 14]: This veil thy full-eyed love denies , And only gleams and fractions spies .
Parsing [sent. 2907 len. 5]: O take it off .
Parsing [sent. 2908 len. 28]: Make no delay , But brush me with thy light , that I May shine unto a perfect day , And warm me at thy glorious eye .
Parsing [sent. 2909 len. 20]: O take it off ; or , till it flee , Though with no lily , stay with me .
Parsing [sent. 2910 len. 51]: I have no room for poems often quoted , therefore not for that lovely one beginning `` They are all gone into the world of light ; '' but I must not omit _ The Retreat _ , for besides its worth , I have another reason for presenting it .
Parsing [sent. 2911 len. 3]: THE RETREAT .
Parsing [sent. 2912 len. 11]: Happy those early days when I Shined in my angel-infancy !
Parsing [sent. 2913 len. 125]: Before I understood this place Appointed for my second race , Or taught my soul to fancy ought But a white , celestial thought ; When yet I had not walked above A mile or two from my first love , And , looking back , at that short space Could see a glimpse of his bright face ; When on some gilded cloud or flower My gazing soul would dwell an hour , And in those weaker glories spy Some shadows of eternity ; Before I taught my tongue to wound My conscience with a sinful sound , Or had the black art to dispense A several sin to every sense ; But felt through all this fleshly dress Bright shoots of everlastingness .
Parsing [sent. 2914 len. 15]: O how I long to travel back , And tread again that ancient track !
Parsing [sent. 2915 len. 28]: That I might once more reach that plain Where first I left my glorious train , From whence the enlightened spirit sees That shady city of palm-trees .
Parsing [sent. 2916 len. 3]: But ah !
Parsing [sent. 2917 len. 15]: my soul with too much stay Is drunk , and staggers in the way !
Parsing [sent. 2918 len. 31]: Some men a forward motion love , But I by backward steps would move ; And when this dust falls to the urn , In that state I came return .
Parsing [sent. 2919 len. 40]: Let any one who is well acquainted with Wordsworth 's grand ode -- that on the _ Intimations of Immortality _ -- turn his mind to a comparison between that and this : he will find the resemblance remarkable .
Parsing [sent. 2920 len. 56]: Whether _ The Retreat _ suggested the form of the _ Ode _ is not of much consequence , for the _ Ode _ is the outcome at once and essence of all Wordsworth 's theories ; and whatever he may have drawn from _ The Retreat _ is glorified in the _ Ode _ .
Parsing [sent. 2921 len. 8]: Still it is interesting to compare them .
Parsing [sent. 2922 len. 31]: Vaughan believes with Wordsworth and some other great men that this is not our first stage of existence ; that we are haunted by dim memories of a former state .
Parsing [sent. 2923 len. 42]: This belief is not necessary , however , to sympathy with the poem , for whether the present be our first life or no , we have come from God , and bring from him conscience and a thousand godlike gifts .
Parsing [sent. 2924 len. 32]: -- `` Happy those early days , '' Vaughan begins : `` There was a time , '' begins Wordsworth , `` when the earth seemed apparelled in celestial light . ''
Parsing [sent. 2925 len. 28]: `` Before I understood this place , '' continues Vaughan : `` Blank misgivings of a creature moving about in worlds not realized , '' says Wordsworth .
Parsing [sent. 2926 len. 23]: `` A white celestial thought , '' says Vaughan : `` Heaven lies about us in our infancy , '' says Wordsworth .
Parsing [sent. 2927 len. 30]: `` A mile or two off , I could see his face , '' says Vaughan : `` Trailing clouds of glory do we come , '' says Wordsworth .
Parsing [sent. 2928 len. 39]: `` On some gilded cloud or flower , my gazing soul would dwell an hour , '' says Vaughan : `` The hour of splendour in the grass , of glory in the flower , '' says Wordsworth .
Parsing [sent. 2929 len. 77]: Wordsworth 's poem is the profounder in its philosophy , as well as far the grander and lovelier in its poetry ; but in the moral relation , Vaughan 's poem is the more definite of the two , and gives us in its close , poor as that is compared with the rest of it , just what we feel is wanting in Wordsworth 's -- the hope of return to the bliss of childhood .
Parsing [sent. 2930 len. 29]: We may be comforted for what we lose by what we gain ; but that is not a recompense large enough to be divine : we want both .
Parsing [sent. 2931 len. 7]: Vaughan will be a child again .
Parsing [sent. 2932 len. 57]: For the movements of man 's life are in spirals : we go back whence we came , ever returning on our former traces , only upon a higher level , on the next upward coil of the spiral , so that it is a going back and a going forward ever and both at once .
Parsing [sent. 2933 len. 43]: Life is , as it were , a constant repentance , or thinking of it again : the childhood of the kingdom takes the place of the childhood of the brain , but comprises all that was lovely in the former delight .
Parsing [sent. 2934 len. 44]: The heavenly children will subdue kingdoms , work righteousness , wax valiant in fight , rout the armies of the aliens , merry of heart as when in the nursery of this world they fought their fancied frigates , and defended their toy-battlements .
Parsing [sent. 2935 len. 14]: Here are the beginning and end of another of similar purport : CHILDHOOD .
Parsing [sent. 2936 len. 18]: I can not reach it ; and my striving eye Dazzles at it , as at eternity .
Parsing [sent. 2937 len. 45]: Were now that chronicle alive , Those white designs which children drive , And the thoughts of each harmless hour , With their content too in my power , Quickly would I make my path even , And by mere playing go to heaven .
Parsing [sent. 2938 len. 10]: * * * * * An age of mysteries !
Parsing [sent. 2939 len. 28]: which he Must live twice that would God 's face see ; Which angels guard , and with it play -- Angels which foul men drive away .
Parsing [sent. 2940 len. 32]: How do I study now , and scan Thee more than e'er I studied man , And only see , through a long night , Thy edges and thy bordering light !
Parsing [sent. 2941 len. 7]: O for thy centre and mid-day !
Parsing [sent. 2942 len. 8]: For sure that is the narrow way !
Parsing [sent. 2943 len. 20]: Many a true thought comes out by the help of a fancy or half-playful exercise of the thinking power .
Parsing [sent. 2944 len. 29]: There is a good deal of such fancy in the following poem , but in the end it rises to the height of the purest and best mysticism .
Parsing [sent. 2945 len. 34]: We must not forget that the deepest man can utter , will be but the type or symbol of a something deeper yet , of which he can perceive only a doubtful glimmer .
Parsing [sent. 2946 len. 24]: This will serve for general remark upon the mystical mode , as well as for comment explanatory of the close of the poem .
Parsing [sent. 2947 len. 3]: THE NIGHT .
Parsing [sent. 2948 len. 3]: JOHN iii .
Parsing [sent. 2949 len. 2]: 2 .
Parsing [sent. 2950 len. 47]: Through that pure virgin-shrine , That sacred veil -LSB- 145 -RSB- drawn o'er thy glorious noon , That men might look and live , as glowworms shine , And face the moon , Wise Nicodemus saw such light As made him know his God by night .
Parsing [sent. 2951 len. 26]: Most blest believer he , Who in that land of darkness and blind eyes , Thy long-expected healing wings could see When thou didst rise !
Parsing [sent. 2952 len. 17]: And , what can never more be done , Did at midnight speak with the sun !
Parsing [sent. 2953 len. 16]: O who will tell me where He found thee at that dead and silent hour ?
Parsing [sent. 2954 len. 23]: What hallowed solitary ground did bear So rare a flower , Within whose sacred leaves did lie The fulness of the Deity ?
Parsing [sent. 2955 len. 45]: No mercy-seat of gold , No dead and dusty cherub , nor carved stone , But his own living works did my Lord hold And lodge alone , Where trees and herbs did watch and peep And wonder , while the Jews did sleep .
Parsing [sent. 2956 len. 3]: Dear night !
Parsing [sent. 2957 len. 31]: this world 's defeat ; The stop to busy fools ; care 's check and curb , The day of spirits ; my soul 's calm retreat Which none disturb !
Parsing [sent. 2958 len. 21]: Christ 's progress , and his prayer time , -LSB- 146 -RSB- The hours to which high heaven doth chime !
Parsing [sent. 2959 len. 62]: -LSB- 147 -RSB- God 's silent , searching flight ; -LSB- 148 -RSB- When my Lord 's head is filled with dew , and all His locks are wet with the clear drops of night , His still , soft call ; His knocking time ; -LSB- 149 -RSB- the soul 's dumb watch , When spirits their fair kindred catch .
Parsing [sent. 2960 len. 49]: Were all my loud , evil -LSB- 150 -RSB- days Calm and unhaunted as is thy dark tent , Whose peace but by some angel 's wing or voice Is seldom rent , Then I in heaven all the long year Would keep , and never wander here .
Parsing [sent. 2961 len. 81]: But living where the sun Doth all things wake , and where all mix and tire Themselves and others , I consent and run To every mire ; And by this world 's ill guiding light , Err more than I can do by night There is in God , some say , A deep but dazzling darkness ; as men here Say it is late and dusky , because they See not all clear : O for that night !
Parsing [sent. 2962 len. 10]: where I in him Might live invisible and dim !
Parsing [sent. 2963 len. 26]: This is glorious ; and its lesson of quiet and retirement we need more than ever in these hurried days upon which we have fallen .
Parsing [sent. 2964 len. 36]: If men would but be still enough in themselves to hear , through all the noises of the busy light , the voice that is ever talking on in the dusky chambers of their hearts !
Parsing [sent. 2965 len. 23]: Look at his love for Nature , too ; and read the fourth stanza in connexion with my previous remarks upon symbolism .
Parsing [sent. 2966 len. 14]: I think this poem _ grander _ than any of George Herbert 's .
Parsing [sent. 2967 len. 8]: I use the word with intended precision .
Parsing [sent. 2968 len. 32]: Here is one , the end of which is not so good , poetically considered , as the magnificent beginning , but which contains striking lines throughout : -- THE DAWNING .
Parsing [sent. 2969 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 2970 len. 6]: what time wilt thou come ?
Parsing [sent. 2971 len. 16]: When shall that cry , _ The Bridegroom 's coming _ , fill the sky ?
Parsing [sent. 2972 len. 14]: Shall it in the evening run When our words and works are done ?
Parsing [sent. 2973 len. 22]: Or will thy all-surprising light Break at midnight , When either sleep or some dark pleasure Possesseth mad man without measure ?
Parsing [sent. 2974 len. 27]: Or shail these early , fragrant hours Unlock thy bowers , -LSB- 151 -RSB- And with their blush of light descry Thy locks crowned with eternity ?
Parsing [sent. 2975 len. 84]: Indeed , it is the only time That with thy glory doth best chime : All now are stirring ; every field Full hymns doth yield ; The whole creation shakes off night , And for thy shadow looks the light ; -LSB- 152 -RSB- Stars now vanish without number ; Sleepy planets set and slumber ; The pursy clouds disband and scatter ; -- All expect some sudden matter ; Not one beam triumphs , but , from far , That morning-star .
Parsing [sent. 2976 len. 169]: O , at what time soever thou , Unknown to us , the heavens wilt bow , And , with thy angels in the van , Descend to judge poor careless man , Grant I may not like puddle lie In a corrupt security , Where , if a traveller water crave , He finds it dead , and in a grave ; But as this restless , vocal spring All day and night doth run and sing , And though here born , yet is acquainted Elsewhere , and , flowing , keeps untainted , So let me all my busy age In thy free services engage ; And though , while here , of force , -LSB- 153 -RSB- I must Have commerce sometimes with poor dust , -LSB- 154 -RSB- And in my flesh , though vile and low , As this doth in her channel , flow , Yet let my course , my aim , my love , And chief acquaintance be above .
Parsing [sent. 2977 len. 36]: So when that day and hour shall come , In which thyself will be the sun , Thou ` lt find me drest and on my way , Watching the break of thy great day .
Parsing [sent. 2978 len. 14]: I do not think that description of the dawn has ever been surpassed .
Parsing [sent. 2979 len. 14]: The verse `` All expect some sudden matter , '' is wondrously fine .
Parsing [sent. 2980 len. 34]: The water `` dead and in a grave , '' because stagnant , is a true fancy ; and the `` acquainted elsewhere '' of the running stream , is a masterly phrase .
Parsing [sent. 2981 len. 11]: I need not point out the symbolism of the poem .
Parsing [sent. 2982 len. 24]: I do not know a writer , Wordsworth not excepted , who reveals more delight in the visions of Nature than Henry Vaughan .
Parsing [sent. 2983 len. 97]: He is a true forerunner of Wordsworth , inasmuch as the latter sets forth with only greater profundity and more art than he , the relations between Nature and Human Nature ; while , on the other hand , he is the forerunner as well of some one that must yet do what Wordsworth has left almost unattempted , namely -- set forth the sympathy of Nature with the aspirations of the spirit that is born of God , born again , I mean , in the recognition of the child 's relation to the Father .
Parsing [sent. 2984 len. 20]: Both Herbert and Vaughan have thus read Nature , the latter turning many leaves which few besides have turned .
Parsing [sent. 2985 len. 26]: In this he has struck upon a deeper and richer lode than even Wordsworth , although he has not wrought it with half his skill .
Parsing [sent. 2986 len. 43]: In any history of the development of the love of the present age for Nature , Vaughan , although I fear his influence would be found to have been small as yet , must be represented as the Phosphor of coming dawn .
Parsing [sent. 2987 len. 29]: Beside him , Thomson is cold , artistic , and gray : although larger in scope , he is not to be compared with him in sympathetic sight .
Parsing [sent. 2988 len. 10]: It is this insight that makes Vaughan a mystic .
Parsing [sent. 2989 len. 32]: He can see one thing everywhere , and all things the same -- yet each with a thousand sides that radiate crossing lights , even as the airy particles around us .
Parsing [sent. 2990 len. 20]: For him everything is the expression of , and points back to , some fact in the Divine Thought .
Parsing [sent. 2991 len. 19]: Along the line of every ray he looks towards its radiating centre -- the heart of the Maker .
Parsing [sent. 2992 len. 25]: I could give many instances of Vaughan 's power in reading the heart of Nature , but I may not dwell upon this phase .
Parsing [sent. 2993 len. 13]: Almost all the poems I give and have given will afford such .
Parsing [sent. 2994 len. 44]: I walked the other day , to spend my hour , Into a field , Where I sometimes had seen the soil to yield A gallant flower ; But winter now had ruffled all the bower And curious store I knew there heretofore .
Parsing [sent. 2995 len. 54]: Yet I whose search loved not to peep and peer I ' th ' face of things , Thought with myself , there might be other springs Besides this here , Which , like cold friends , sees us but once a year ; And so the flower Might have some other bower .
Parsing [sent. 2996 len. 46]: Then taking up what I could nearest spy , I digged about That place where I had seen him to grow out ; And by and by I saw the warm recluse alone to lie , Where fresh and green He lived of us unseen .
Parsing [sent. 2997 len. 44]: Many a question intricate and rare Did I there strow ; But all I could extort was , that he now Did there repair Such losses as befell him in this air , And would ere long Come forth most fair and young .
Parsing [sent. 2998 len. 42]: This past , I threw the clothes quite o'er his head ; And , stung with fear Of my own frailty , dropped down many a tear Upon his bed ; Then sighing , whispered , _ Happy are the dead !
Parsing [sent. 2999 len. 9]: What peace doth now Rock him asleep below !
Parsing [sent. 3000 len. 47]: _ And yet , how few believe such doctrine springs From a poor root Which all the winter sleeps here under foot , And hath no wings To raise it to the truth and light of things , But is still trod By every wandering clod !
Parsing [sent. 3001 len. 14]: O thou , whose spirit did at first inflame And warm the dead !
Parsing [sent. 3002 len. 22]: And by a sacred incubation fed With life this frame , Which once had neither being , form , nor name !
Parsing [sent. 3003 len. 59]: Grant I may so Thy steps track here below , That in these masks and shadows I may see Thy sacred way ; And by those hid ascents climb to that day Which breaks from thee , Who art in all things , though invisibly : Show me thy peace , Thy mercy , love , and ease .
Parsing [sent. 3004 len. 52]: And from this care , where dreams and sorrows reign , Lead me above , Where light , joy , leisure , and true comforts move Without all pain : There , hid in thee , show me his life again At whose dumb urn Thus all the year I mourn .
Parsing [sent. 3005 len. 28]: There are several amongst his poems lamenting , like this , the death of some dear friend -- perhaps his twin-brother , whom he outlived thirty years .
Parsing [sent. 3006 len. 32]: According to what a man is capable of seeing in nature , he becomes either a man of appliance , a man of science , a mystic , or a poet .
Parsing [sent. 3007 len. 16]: I must now give two that are simple in thought , construction , and music .
Parsing [sent. 3008 len. 22]: The latter ought to be popular , from the nature of its rhythmic movement , and the holy merriment it carries .
Parsing [sent. 3009 len. 65]: But in the former , note how the major key of gladness changes in the third stanza to the minor key of aspiration , which has always some sadness in it ; a sadness which deepens to grief in the next stanza at the consciousness of unfitness for Christ 's company , but is lifted by hope almost again to gladness in the last .
Parsing [sent. 3010 len. 4]: CHRIST 'S NATIVITY .
Parsing [sent. 3011 len. 5]: Awake , glad heart !
Parsing [sent. 3012 len. 6]: Get up , and sing !
Parsing [sent. 3013 len. 8]: It is the birthday of thy king !
Parsing [sent. 3014 len. 2]: Awake !
Parsing [sent. 3015 len. 2]: awake !
Parsing [sent. 3016 len. 22]: The sun doth shake Light from his locks , and , all the way Breathing perfumes , doth spice the day .
Parsing [sent. 3017 len. 2]: Awake !
Parsing [sent. 3018 len. 2]: awake !
Parsing [sent. 3019 len. 18]: Hark how the wood rings Winds whisper , and the busy springs A concert make : Awake !
Parsing [sent. 3020 len. 2]: awake !
Parsing [sent. 3021 len. 14]: Man is their high-priest , and should rise To offer up the sacrifice .
Parsing [sent. 3022 len. 24]: I would I were some bird or star , Fluttering in woods , or lifted far Above this inn And road of sin !
Parsing [sent. 3023 len. 14]: Then either star or bird should be Shining or singing still to thee .
Parsing [sent. 3024 len. 13]: I would I had in my best part Fit rooms for thee !
Parsing [sent. 3025 len. 12]: or that my heart Were so clean as Thy manger was !
Parsing [sent. 3026 len. 20]: But I am all filth , and obscene ; Yet , if thou wilt , thou canst make clean .
Parsing [sent. 3027 len. 3]: Sweet Jesu !
Parsing [sent. 3028 len. 3]: will then .
Parsing [sent. 3029 len. 11]: Let no more This leper haunt and soil thy door .
Parsing [sent. 3030 len. 10]: Cure him , ease him ; O release him !
Parsing [sent. 3031 len. 18]: And let once more , by mystic birth , The Lord of life be born in earth .
Parsing [sent. 3032 len. 10]: The fitting companion to this is his EASTER HYMN .
Parsing [sent. 3033 len. 15]: Death and darkness , get you packing : Nothing now to man is lacking .
Parsing [sent. 3034 len. 14]: All your triumphs now are ended , And what Adam marred is mended .
Parsing [sent. 3035 len. 65]: Graves are beds now for the weary ; Death a nap , to wake more merry ; Youth now , full of pious duty , Seeks in thee for perfect beauty ; The weak and aged , tired with length Of days , from thee look for new strength ; And infants with thy pangs contest , As pleasant as if with the breast .
Parsing [sent. 3036 len. 43]: Then unto him who thus hath thrown Even to contempt thy kingdom down , And by his blood did us advance Unto his own inheritance -- To him be glory , power , praise , From this unto the last of days !
Parsing [sent. 3037 len. 51]: We must now descend from this height of true utterance into the Valley of Humiliation , and can not do better than console ourselves by listening to the boy in mean clothes , of the fresh and well-favoured countenance , whom Christiana and her fellow-pilgrims hear singing in that valley .
Parsing [sent. 3038 len. 31]: He that is down , needs fear no fall ; He that is low , no pride ; He that is humble ever shall Have God to be his guide .
Parsing [sent. 3039 len. 31]: I am content with what I have , Little be it or much ; And , Lord , contentment still I crave , Because thou savest -LSB- 155 -RSB- such .
Parsing [sent. 3040 len. 25]: Fulness to such a burden is That go on pilgrimage ; Here little , and hereafter bliss , Is best from age to age .
Parsing [sent. 3041 len. 50]: I could not have my book without one word in it of John Bunyan , the tinker , probably the gipsy , who although born only and not made a poet , like his great brother , John Milton , has uttered in prose a wealth of poetic thought .
Parsing [sent. 3042 len. 11]: He was born in 1628 , twenty years after Milton .
Parsing [sent. 3043 len. 36]: I must not , however , remark on this noble Bohemian of literature and prophecy ; but leaving at length these flowery hills and meadows behind me , step on my way across the desert .
Parsing [sent. 3044 len. 29]: -- England had now fallen under the influence of France instead of Italy , and that influence has never been for good to our literature , at least .
Parsing [sent. 3045 len. 36]: Thence its chief aim grew to be a desirable trimness of speech and logical arrangement of matter -- good external qualities purchased at a fearful price with the loss of all that makes poetry precious .
Parsing [sent. 3046 len. 36]: The poets of England , with John Dryden at their head , ceased almost for a time to deal with the truths of humanity , and gave themselves to the facts and relations of society .
Parsing [sent. 3047 len. 38]: The nation which could recall the family of the Stuarts must necessarily fall into such a decay of spiritual life as should render its literature only respectable at the best , and its religious utterances essentially vulgar .
Parsing [sent. 3048 len. 6]: But the decay is gradual .
Parsing [sent. 3049 len. 22]: Bishop Ken , born in 1637 , is known chiefly by his hymns for the morning and evening , deservedly popular .
Parsing [sent. 3050 len. 21]: He has , however , written a great many besides -- too many , indeed , for variety or excellence .
Parsing [sent. 3051 len. 14]: He seems to have set himself to write them as acts of worship .
Parsing [sent. 3052 len. 25]: They present many signs of a perversion of taste which , though not in them so remarkable , rose to a height before long .
Parsing [sent. 3053 len. 37]: He annoys us besides by the constant recurrence of certain phrases , one or two of which are not admirable , and by using , in the midst of a simple style , odd Latin words .
Parsing [sent. 3054 len. 18]: Here are portions of , I think , one of his best , and good it is .
Parsing [sent. 3055 len. 5]: FIRST SUNDAY AFTER CHRISTMAS .
Parsing [sent. 3056 len. 45]: * * * * * Lord , 't is thyself who hast impressed In native light on human breast , That their Creator all Mankind should Father call : A father 's love all mortals know , And the love filial which they owe .
Parsing [sent. 3057 len. 41]: Our Father gives us heavenly light , And to be happy , ghostly sight ; He blesses , guides , sustains ; He eases us in pains ; Abatements for our weakness makes , And never a true child forsakes .
Parsing [sent. 3058 len. 37]: He waits till the hard heart relents ; Our self-damnation he laments ; He sweetly them invites To share in heaven 's delights ; His arms he opens to receive All who for past transgressions grieve .
Parsing [sent. 3059 len. 3]: My Father !
Parsing [sent. 3060 len. 11]: O that name is sweet To sinners mourning in retreat .
Parsing [sent. 3061 len. 25]: God 's heart paternal yearns When he a change discerns ; He to his favour them restores ; He heals their most inveterate sores .
Parsing [sent. 3062 len. 82]: * * * * * Religious honour , humble awe ; Obedience to our Father 's law ; A lively grateful sense Of tenderness immense ; Full trust on God 's paternal cares ; Submission which chastisement bears ; Grief , when his goodness we offend ; Zeal , to his likeness to ascend ; Will , from the world refined , To his sole will resigned : These graces in God 's children shine , Reflections of the love divine .
Parsing [sent. 3063 len. 44]: * * * * * God 's Son co-equal taught us all In prayer his Father ours to call : With confidence in need , We to our Father speed : Of his own Son the language dear Intenerates the Father 's ear .
Parsing [sent. 3064 len. 4]: _ makes tender .
Parsing [sent. 3065 len. 43]: _ Thou Father art , though to my shame , I often forfeit that dear name ; But since for sin I grieve , Me father-like receive ; O melt me into filial tears , To pay of love my vast arrears .
Parsing [sent. 3066 len. 10]: * * * * * O Spirit of Adoption !
Parsing [sent. 3067 len. 13]: spread Thy wings enamouring o'er my head ; O Filial love immense !
Parsing [sent. 3068 len. 22]: Raise me to love intense ; O Father , source of love divine , My powers to love and hymn incline !
Parsing [sent. 3069 len. 29]: While God my Father I revere , Nor all hell powers , nor death I fear ; I am my Father 's care ; His succours present are .
Parsing [sent. 3070 len. 17]: All comes from my loved Father 's will , And that sweet name intends no ill .
Parsing [sent. 3071 len. 48]: God 's Son his soul , when life he closed , In his dear Father 's hands reposed : I 'll , when my last I breathe , My soul to God bequeath ; And panting for the joys on high , Invoking Love Paternal , die .
Parsing [sent. 3072 len. 64]: Born in 1657 , one of the later English Platonists , John Norris , who , with how many incumbents between I do not know , succeeded George Herbert in the cure of Bemerton , has left a few poems , which would have been better if he had not been possessed with the common admiration for the rough-shod rhythms of Abraham Cowley .
Parsing [sent. 3073 len. 15]: Here is one in which the peculiarities of his theories show themselves very prominently .
Parsing [sent. 3074 len. 16]: There is a constant tendency in such to wander into the region half-spiritual , half-material .
Parsing [sent. 3075 len. 3]: THE ASPIRATION .
Parsing [sent. 3076 len. 51]: How long , great God , how long must I Immured in this dark prison lie ; My soul must watch to have intelligence ; Where at the grates and avenues of sense Where but faint gleams of thee salute my sight , Like doubtful moonshine in a cloudy night ?
Parsing [sent. 3077 len. 19]: When shall I leave this magic sphere , And be all mind , all eye , all ear ?
Parsing [sent. 3078 len. 5]: How cold this clime !
Parsing [sent. 3079 len. 10]: And yet my sense Perceives even here thy influence .
Parsing [sent. 3080 len. 18]: Even here thy strong magnetic charms I feel , And pant and tremble like the amorous steel .
Parsing [sent. 3081 len. 33]: To lower good , and beauties less divine , Sometimes my erroneous needle does decline , But yet , so strong the sympathy , It turns , and points again to thee .
Parsing [sent. 3082 len. 14]: I long to see this excellence Which at such distance strikes my sense .
Parsing [sent. 3083 len. 15]: My impatient soul struggles to disengage Her wings from the confinement of her cage .
Parsing [sent. 3084 len. 22]: Wouldst thou , great Love , this prisoner once set free , How would she hasten to be linked to thee !
Parsing [sent. 3085 len. 19]: She 'd for no angels ' conduct stay , But fly , and love on all the way .
Parsing [sent. 3086 len. 3]: THE RETURN .
Parsing [sent. 3087 len. 3]: Dear Contemplation !
Parsing [sent. 3088 len. 4]: my divinest joy !
Parsing [sent. 3089 len. 14]: When I thy sacred mount ascend , What heavenly sweets my soul employ !
Parsing [sent. 3090 len. 11]: Why ca n't I there my days for ever spend ?
Parsing [sent. 3091 len. 20]: When I have conquered thy steep heights with pain , What pity 't is that I must down again !
Parsing [sent. 3092 len. 35]: And yet I must : my passions would rebel Should I too long continue here : No , here I must not think to dwell , But mind the duties of my proper sphere .
Parsing [sent. 3093 len. 18]: So angels , though they heaven 's glories know , Forget not to attend their charge below .
Parsing [sent. 3094 len. 36]: The old hermits thought to overcome their impulses by retiring from the world : our Platonist has discovered for himself that the world of duty is the only sphere in which they can be combated .
Parsing [sent. 3095 len. 38]: Never perhaps is a saint more in danger of giving way to impulse , let it be anger or what it may , than in the moment when he has just descended from this mount of contemplation .
Parsing [sent. 3096 len. 14]: We find ourselves now in the zone of _ hymn _ - writing .
Parsing [sent. 3097 len. 34]: From this period , that is , from towards the close of the seventeenth century , a large amount of the fervour of the country finds vent in hymns : they are innumerable .
Parsing [sent. 3098 len. 28]: With them the scope of my book would not permit me to deal , even had I inclination thitherward , and knowledge enough to undertake their history .
Parsing [sent. 3099 len. 17]: But I am not therefore precluded from presenting any hymn whose literary excellence makes it worthy .
Parsing [sent. 3100 len. 44]: It is with especial pleasure that I refer to a little book which was once a household treasure in a multitude of families , -LSB- 156 -RSB- the _ Spiritual Songs _ of John Mason , a clergyman in the county of Buckingham .
Parsing [sent. 3101 len. 27]: The date of his birth does not appear to be known , but the first edition of these songs -LSB- 157 -RSB- was published in 1683 .
Parsing [sent. 3102 len. 19]: Dr. Watts was very fond of them : would that he had written with similar modesty of style !
Parsing [sent. 3103 len. 11]: A few of them are still popular in congregational singing .
Parsing [sent. 3104 len. 17]: Here is the first in the book : A GENERAL SONG OF PRAISE TO ALMIGHTY GOD .
Parsing [sent. 3105 len. 11]: How shall I sing that Majesty Which angels do admire ?
Parsing [sent. 3106 len. 16]: Let dust in dust and silence lie ; Sing , sing , ye heavenly choir .
Parsing [sent. 3107 len. 27]: Thousands of thousands stand around Thy throne , O God most high ; Ten thousand times ten thousand sound Thy praise ; but who am I ?
Parsing [sent. 3108 len. 27]: Thy brightness unto them appears , Whilst I thy footsteps trace ; A sound of God comes to my ears ; But they behold thy face .
Parsing [sent. 3109 len. 28]: They sing because thou art their sun : Lord , send a beam on me ; For where heaven is but once begun , There hallelujahs be .
Parsing [sent. 3110 len. 28]: Enlighten with faith 's light my heart ; Enflame it with love 's fire ; Then shall I sing and bear a part With that celestial choir .
Parsing [sent. 3111 len. 33]: I shall , I fear , be dark and cold , With all my fire and light ; Yet when thou dost accept their gold , Lord , treasure up my mite .
Parsing [sent. 3112 len. 10]: How great a being , Lord , is thine .
Parsing [sent. 3113 len. 6]: Which doth all beings keep !
Parsing [sent. 3114 len. 13]: Thy knowledge is the only line To sound so vast a deep .
Parsing [sent. 3115 len. 26]: Thou art a sea without a shore , A sun without a sphere ; Thy time is now and evermore , Thy place is everywhere .
Parsing [sent. 3116 len. 16]: How good art thou , whose goodness is Our parent , nurse , and guide !
Parsing [sent. 3117 len. 12]: Whose streams do water Paradise , And all the earth beside !
Parsing [sent. 3118 len. 27]: Thine upper and thy nether springs Make both thy worlds to thrive ; Under thy warm and sheltering wings Thou keep ` st two broods alive .
Parsing [sent. 3119 len. 29]: Thy arm of might , most mighty king Both rocks and hearts doth break : My God , thou canst do everything But what should show thee weak .
Parsing [sent. 3120 len. 28]: Thou canst not cross thyself , or be Less than thyself , or poor ; But whatsoever pleaseth thee , That canst thou do , and more .
Parsing [sent. 3121 len. 15]: Who would not fear thy searching eye , Witness to all that 's true !
Parsing [sent. 3122 len. 12]: Dark Hell , and deep Hypocrisy Lie plain before its view .
Parsing [sent. 3123 len. 25]: Motions and thoughts before they grow , Thy knowledge doth espy ; What unborn ages are to do , Is done before thine eye .
Parsing [sent. 3124 len. 23]: Thy wisdom which both makes and mends , We ever much admire : Creation all our wit transcends ; Redemption rises higher .
Parsing [sent. 3125 len. 28]: Thy wisdom guides strayed sinners home , ` Twill make the dead world rise , And bring those prisoners to their doom : Its paths are mysteries .
Parsing [sent. 3126 len. 27]: Great is thy truth , and shall prevail To unbelievers ' shame : Thy truth and years do never fail ; Thou ever art the same .
Parsing [sent. 3127 len. 23]: Unbelief is a raging wave Dashing against a rock : If God doth not his Israel save , Then let Egyptians mock .
Parsing [sent. 3128 len. 27]: Most pure and holy are thine eyes , Most holy is thy name ; Thy saints , and laws , and penalties , Thy holiness proclaim .
Parsing [sent. 3129 len. 32]: This is the devil 's scourge and sting , This is the angels ' song , Who _ holy , holy , holy _ sing , In heavenly Canaan 's tongue .
Parsing [sent. 3130 len. 13]: Mercy , that shining attribute , The sinner 's hope and plea !
Parsing [sent. 3131 len. 15]: Huge hosts of sins in their pursuit , Are drowned in thy Red Sea .
Parsing [sent. 3132 len. 27]: Mercy is God 's memorial , And in all ages praised : My God , thine only Son did fall , That Mercy might be raised .
Parsing [sent. 3133 len. 29]: Thy bright back-parts , O God of grace , I humbly here adore : Show me thy glory and thy face , That I may praise thee more .
Parsing [sent. 3134 len. 32]: Since none can see thy face and live , For me to die is best : Through Jordan 's streams who would not dive , To land at Canaan 's rest ?
Parsing [sent. 3135 len. 51]: To these _ Songs of Praise _ is appended another series called _ Penitential Cries _ , by the Rev. Thomas Shepherd , who , for a short time a clergyman in Buckinghamshire , became the minister of the Congregational church at Northampton , afterwards under the care of Doddridge .
Parsing [sent. 3136 len. 15]: Although he was an imitator of Mason , some of his hymns are admirable .
Parsing [sent. 3137 len. 15]: The following I think one of the best : -- FOR COMMUNION WITH GOD .
Parsing [sent. 3138 len. 15]: Alas , my God , that we should be Such strangers to each other !
Parsing [sent. 3139 len. 14]: O that as friends we might agree , And walk and talk together !
Parsing [sent. 3140 len. 32]: Thou know ` st my soul does dearly love The place of thine abode ; No music drops so sweet a sound As these two words , _ My God _ .
Parsing [sent. 3141 len. 19]: * * * * * May I taste that communion , Lord , Thy people have with thee ?
Parsing [sent. 3142 len. 14]: Thy spirit daily talks with them , O let it talk with me !
Parsing [sent. 3143 len. 28]: Like Enoch , let me walk with God , And thus walk out my day , Attended with the heavenly guards , Upon the king 's highway .
Parsing [sent. 3144 len. 9]: When wilt thou come unto me , Lord ?
Parsing [sent. 3145 len. 8]: O come , my Lord most dear !
Parsing [sent. 3146 len. 17]: Come near , come nearer , nearer still : I 'm well when thou art near .
Parsing [sent. 3147 len. 14]: * * * * * When wilt thou come unto me , Lord ?
Parsing [sent. 3148 len. 21]: For , till thou dost appear , I count each moment for a day , Each minute for a year .
Parsing [sent. 3149 len. 33]: * * * * * There 's no such thing as pleasure here ; My Jesus is my all : As thou dost shine or disappear , My pleasures rise and fall .
Parsing [sent. 3150 len. 29]: Come , spread thy savour on my frame -- No sweetness is so sweet ; Till I get up to sing thy name Where all thy singers meet .
Parsing [sent. 3151 len. 44]: In the writings of both we recognize a straight-forwardness of expression equal to that of Wither , and a quaint simplicity of thought and form like that of Herrick ; while the very charm of some of the best lines is their spontaneity .
Parsing [sent. 3152 len. 15]: The men have just enough mysticism to afford them homeliest figures for deepest feelings .
Parsing [sent. 3153 len. 8]: I turn to the accomplished Joseph Addison .
Parsing [sent. 3154 len. 6]: He was born in 1672 .
Parsing [sent. 3155 len. 99]: His religious poems are so well known , and are for the greater part so ordinary in everything but their simplicity of composition , that I should hardly have cared to choose one , had it not been that we owe him much gratitude for what he did , in the reigns of Anne and George I. , to purify the moral taste of the English people at a time when the influence of the clergy was not for elevation , and to teach the love of a higher literature when Milton was little known and less esteemed .
Parsing [sent. 3156 len. 24]: Especially are we indebted to him for his modest and admirable criticism of the _ Paradise Lost _ in the _ Spectator _ .
Parsing [sent. 3157 len. 22]: Of those few poems to which I have referred , I choose the best known , because it is the best .
Parsing [sent. 3158 len. 13]: It has to me a charm for which I can hardly account .
Parsing [sent. 3159 len. 37]: Yet I imagine I see in it a sign of the poetic times : a flatness of spirit , arising from the evanishment of the mystical element , begins to result in a worship of power .
Parsing [sent. 3160 len. 39]: Neither power nor wisdom , though infinite both , could constitute a God worthy of the worship of a human soul ; and the worship of such a God must sink to the level of that fancied divinity .
Parsing [sent. 3161 len. 21]: Small wonder is it then that the lyric should now droop its wings and moult the feathers of its praise .
Parsing [sent. 3162 len. 46]: I do not say that God 's more glorious attributes are already forgotten , but that the tendency of the Christian lyric is now to laudation of power -- and knowledge , a form of the same -- as _ the _ essential of Godhead .
Parsing [sent. 3163 len. 87]: This indicates no recalling of metaphysical questions , such as we have met in foregoing verse , but a decline towards system ; a rising passion -- if anything so cold may be called _ a passion _ -- for the reduction of all things to the forms of the understanding , a declension which has prepared the way for the present worship of science , and its refusal , if not denial , of all that can not be proved in forms of the intellect .
Parsing [sent. 3164 len. 73]: The hymn which has led to these remarks is still good , although , like the loveliness of the red and lowering west , it gives sign of a gray and cheerless dawn , under whose dreariness the child will first doubt if his father loves him , and next doubt if he has a father at all , and is not a mere foundling that Nature has lifted from her path .
Parsing [sent. 3165 len. 26]: The spacious firmament on high , With all the blue etherial sky , And spangled heavens , a shining frame , Their great Original proclaim .
Parsing [sent. 3166 len. 26]: The unwearied sun from day to day Does his Creator 's power display ; And publishes to every land The work of an almighty hand .
Parsing [sent. 3167 len. 62]: Soon as the evening shades prevail , The moon takes up the wondrous tale ; And nightly to the listening earth Repeats the story of her birth ; Whilst all the stars that round her burn , And all the planets , in their turn , Confirm the tidings as they roll , And spread the truth from pole to pole .
Parsing [sent. 3168 len. 13]: What though in solemn silence all Move round the dark terrestrial ball ?
Parsing [sent. 3169 len. 14]: What though no real voice nor sound Amidst their radiant orbs be found ?
Parsing [sent. 3170 len. 32]: In reason 's ear they all rejoice , And utter forth a glorious voice , For ever singing as they shine : `` The hand that made us is divine . ''
Parsing [sent. 3171 len. 34]: The very use of the words _ spangled _ and _ frame _ seems -- to my fancy only , it may be -- to indicate a tendency towards the unworthy and theatrical .
Parsing [sent. 3172 len. 23]: Yet the second stanza is lovely beyond a doubt ; and the whole is most artistic , although after a tame fashion .
Parsing [sent. 3173 len. 39]: Whether indeed the heavenly bodies _ teach _ what he says , or whether we should read divinity worthy of the name in them at all , without the human revelation which healed men , I doubt much .
Parsing [sent. 3174 len. 34]: That divinity is there -- _ Yes _ ; that we could read it there without having seen the face of the Son of Man first , I think -- _ No _ .
Parsing [sent. 3175 len. 30]: I do not therefore dare imagine that no revelation dimly leading towards such result glimmered in the hearts of God 's chosen amongst Jews and Gentiles before he came .
Parsing [sent. 3176 len. 28]: What I say is , that power and order , although of God , and preparing the way for him , are not his revealers unto men .
Parsing [sent. 3177 len. 46]: No doubt King David compares the perfection of God 's law to the glory of the heavens , but he did not learn that perfection from the heavens , but from the law itself , revealed in his own heart through the life-teaching of God .
Parsing [sent. 3178 len. 14]: When he had learned it he saw that the heavens were like it .
Parsing [sent. 3179 len. 12]: To unveil God , only manhood like our own will serve .
Parsing [sent. 3180 len. 20]: And he has taken the form of man that he might reveal the manhood in him from awful eternity .
Parsing [sent. 3181 len. 3]: CHAPTER XIX .
Parsing [sent. 3182 len. 3]: THE PLAIN .
Parsing [sent. 3183 len. 26]: But Addison 's tameness is wonderfully lovely beside the fervours of a man of honoured name , -- Dr. Isaac Watts , born in 1674 .
Parsing [sent. 3184 len. 18]: The result must be dreadful where fervour will poetize without the aidful restraints of art and modesty .
Parsing [sent. 3185 len. 40]: If any man would look upon absurdity in the garb of sobriety , let him search Dryden 's _ Annus Mirabilis _ : Dr. Watts 's _ Lyrics _ are as bad ; they are fantastic to utter folly .
Parsing [sent. 3186 len. 28]: An admiration of `` the incomparable Mr. Cowley '' did the sense of them more injury than the imitation of his rough-cantering ode could do their rhythm .
Parsing [sent. 3187 len. 30]: The sentimentalities of Roman Catholic writers towards our Lord and his mother , are not half so offensive as the courtier-like flatteries Dr. Watts offers to the Most High .
Parsing [sent. 3188 len. 12]: To say nothing of the irreverence , the vulgarity is offensive .
Parsing [sent. 3189 len. 23]: He affords another instance amongst thousands how little the form in which feeling is expressed has to do with the feeling itself .
Parsing [sent. 3190 len. 28]: In him the thought is true , the form of its utterance false ; the feeling lovely , the word , often to a degree , repulsive .
Parsing [sent. 3191 len. 44]: The ugly web is crossed now and then by a fine line , and even damasked with an occasional good poem : I have found two , and only two , in the whole of his seventy-five _ Lyrics sacred to Devotion _ .
Parsing [sent. 3192 len. 38]: His objectivity and boldness of thought , and his freedom of utterance , cause us ever and anon to lament that he had not the humility and faith of an artist as well as of a Christian .
Parsing [sent. 3193 len. 14]: Almost all his symbols indicate a worship of power and of outward show .
Parsing [sent. 3194 len. 19]: I give the best of the two good poems I have mentioned , and very good it is .
Parsing [sent. 3195 len. 3]: HAPPY FRAILTY .
Parsing [sent. 3196 len. 8]: `` How meanly dwells the immortal mind !
Parsing [sent. 3197 len. 6]: How vile these bodies are !
Parsing [sent. 3198 len. 13]: Why was a clod of earth designed To enclose a heavenly star ?
Parsing [sent. 3199 len. 8]: `` Weak cottage where our souls reside !
Parsing [sent. 3200 len. 6]: This flesh a tottering wall !
Parsing [sent. 3201 len. 12]: With frightful breaches gaping wide , The building bends to fall .
Parsing [sent. 3202 len. 28]: `` All round it storms of trouble blow , And waves of sorrow roll ; Cold waves and winter storms beat through , And pain the tenant-soul .
Parsing [sent. 3203 len. 9]: `` Alas , how frail our state ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3204 len. 21]: said I , And thus went mourning on ; Till sudden from the cleaving sky A gleam of glory shone .
Parsing [sent. 3205 len. 27]: My soul all felt the glory come , And breathed her native air ; Then she remembered heaven her home , And she a prisoner here .
Parsing [sent. 3206 len. 26]: Straight she began to change her key ; And , joyful in her pains , She sang the frailty of her clay In pleasurable strains .
Parsing [sent. 3207 len. 10]: `` How weak the prison is where I dwell !
Parsing [sent. 3208 len. 6]: Flesh but a tottering wall !
Parsing [sent. 3209 len. 10]: The breaches cheerfully foretell The house must shortly fall .
Parsing [sent. 3210 len. 29]: `` No more , my friends , shall I complain , Though all my heart-strings ache ; Welcome disease , and every pain That makes the cottage shake !
Parsing [sent. 3211 len. 28]: `` Now let the tempest blow all round , Now swell the surges high , And beat this house of bondage down To let the stranger fly !
Parsing [sent. 3212 len. 27]: `` I have a mansion built above By the eternal hand ; And should the earth 's old basis move , My heavenly house must stand .
Parsing [sent. 3213 len. 30]: `` Yes , for 't is there my Saviour reigns -- I long to see the God -- And his immortal strength sustains The courts that cost him blood .
Parsing [sent. 3214 len. 3]: `` Hark !
Parsing [sent. 3215 len. 16]: from on high my Saviour calls : I come , my Lord , my Love !
Parsing [sent. 3216 len. 12]: Devotion breaks the prison-walls , And speeds my last remove . ''
Parsing [sent. 3217 len. 11]: His psalms and hymns are immeasurably better than his lyrics .
Parsing [sent. 3218 len. 27]: Dreadful some of them are ; and I doubt if there is one from which we would not wish stanzas , lines , and words absent .
Parsing [sent. 3219 len. 6]: But some are very fine .
Parsing [sent. 3220 len. 53]: The man who could write such verses as these ought not to have written as he has written : -- Had I a glance of thee , my God , Kingdoms and men would vanish soon ; Vanish as though I saw them not , As a dim candle dies at noon .
Parsing [sent. 3221 len. 30]: Then they might fight and rage and rave : I should perceive the noise no more Than we can hear a shaking leaf While rattling thunders round us roar .
Parsing [sent. 3222 len. 55]: Some of his hymns will be sung , I fancy , so long as men praise God together ; for most heartily do I grant that of all hymns I know he has produced the best for public use ; but these bear a very small proportion indeed to the mass of his labour .
Parsing [sent. 3223 len. 14]: We can not help wishing that he had written about the twentieth part .
Parsing [sent. 3224 len. 68]: We could not have too much of his best , such as this : Be earth with all her scenes withdrawn ; Let noise and vanity begone : In secret silence of the mind My heaven , and there my God , I find ; but there is no occasion for the best to be so plentiful : a little of it will go a great way .
Parsing [sent. 3225 len. 32]: And as our best moments are so few , how could any man write six hundred religious poems , and produce quality in proportion to quantity save in an inverse ratio ?
Parsing [sent. 3226 len. 24]: Dr. Thomas Parnell , the well-known poet , a clergyman , born in Dublin in 1679 , has written a few religious verses .
Parsing [sent. 3227 len. 23]: The following have a certain touch of imagination and consequent grace , which distinguishes them above the swampy level of the time .
Parsing [sent. 3228 len. 4]: HYMN FOR EVENING .
Parsing [sent. 3229 len. 25]: The beam-repelling mists arise , And evening spreads obscurer skies ; The twilight will the night forerun , And night itself be soon begun .
Parsing [sent. 3230 len. 28]: Upon thy knees devoutly bow , And pray the Lord of glory now To fill thy breast , or deadly sin May cause a blinder night within .
Parsing [sent. 3231 len. 100]: And whether pleasing vapours rise , Which gently dim the closing eyes , Which make the weary members blest With sweet refreshment in their rest ; Or whether spirits -LSB- 158 -RSB- in the brain Dispel their soft embrace again , And on my watchful bed I stay , Forsook by sleep , and waiting day ; Be God for ever in my view , And never he forsake me too ; But still as day concludes in night , To break again with new-born light , His wondrous bounty let me find With still a more enlightened mind .
Parsing [sent. 3232 len. 46]: * * * * * Thou that hast thy palace far Above the moon and every star ; Thou that sittest on a throne To which the night was never known , Regard my voice , and make me blest By kindly granting its request .
Parsing [sent. 3233 len. 30]: If thoughts on thee my soul employ , My darkness will afford me joy , Till thou shalt call and I shall soar , And part with darkness evermore .
Parsing [sent. 3234 len. 27]: Many long and elaborate religious poems I have not even mentioned , because I can not favour extracts , especially in heroic couplets or blank verse .
Parsing [sent. 3235 len. 13]: They would only make my book heavy , and destroy the song-idea .
Parsing [sent. 3236 len. 37]: I must here pass by one of the best of such poems , _ The Complaint , or Night Thoughts _ of Dr. Young ; nor is there anything else of his I care to quote .
Parsing [sent. 3237 len. 19]: I must give just one poem of Pope , born in 1688 , the year of the Revolution .
Parsing [sent. 3238 len. 23]: The flamboyant style of his _ Messiah _ is to me detestable : nothing can be more unlike the simplicity of Christianity .
Parsing [sent. 3239 len. 32]: All such , equally with those by whatever hand that would be religious by being miserable , I reject at once , along with all that are merely commonplace religious exercises .
Parsing [sent. 3240 len. 31]: But this at least is very unlike the rest of Pope 's compositions : it is as simple in utterance as it is large in scope and practical in bearing .
Parsing [sent. 3241 len. 56]: The name _ Jove _ may be unpleasant to some ears : it is to mine -- not because it is the name given to their deity by men who had had little outward revelation , but because of the associations which the wanton poets , not the good philosophers , have gathered about it .
Parsing [sent. 3242 len. 20]: Here let it stand , as Pope meant it , for one of the names of the Unknown God .
Parsing [sent. 3243 len. 4]: THE UNIVERSAL PRAYER .
Parsing [sent. 3244 len. 4]: Father of all !
Parsing [sent. 3245 len. 26]: in every age , In every clime adored , By saint , by savage , and by sage , Jehovah , Jove , or Lord !
Parsing [sent. 3246 len. 8]: Thou great First Cause , least understood !
Parsing [sent. 3247 len. 81]: Who all my sense confined To know but this , that thou art good , And that myself am blind Yet gave me , in this dark estate , To see the good from ill ; And , binding Nature fast in Fate , Left free the human will : What Conscience dictates to be done , Or warns me not to do -- This , teach me more than hell to shun , That , more than heaven pursue .
Parsing [sent. 3248 len. 27]: What blessings thy free bounty gives , Let me not cast away ; For God is paid when man receives : To enjoy is to obey .
Parsing [sent. 3249 len. 27]: Yet not to earth 's contracted span Thy goodness let me bound , Or think thee Lord alone of man , When thousand worlds are round .
Parsing [sent. 3250 len. 26]: Let not this weak , unknowing hand Presume thy bolts to throw , And deal damnation round the land On each I judge thy foe .
Parsing [sent. 3251 len. 30]: If I am right , thy grace impart Still in the right to stay ; If I am wrong , O teach my heart To find that better way .
Parsing [sent. 3252 len. 23]: Save me alike from foolish pride Or impious discontent , At aught thy wisdom has denied , Or aught thy goodness lent .
Parsing [sent. 3253 len. 28]: Teach me to feel another 's woe , To hide the fault I see : That mercy I to others show , That mercy show to me .
Parsing [sent. 3254 len. 31]: Mean though I am -- not wholly so , Since quickened by thy breath : -- O lead me wheresoe'er I go , Through this day 's life or death .
Parsing [sent. 3255 len. 32]: This day , be bread and peace my lot : All else beneath the sun Thou know ` st if best bestowed or not , And let thy will be done .
Parsing [sent. 3256 len. 25]: To thee , whose temple is all space , Whose altar , earth , sea , skies , One chorus let all being raise !
Parsing [sent. 3257 len. 6]: All Nature 's incense rise !
Parsing [sent. 3258 len. 13]: And now we come upon a strange little well in the desert .
Parsing [sent. 3259 len. 45]: Few flowers indeed shine upon its brink , and it flows with a somewhat unmusical ripple : it is a well of the water of life notwithstanding , for its song tells of the love and truth which are the grand power of God .
Parsing [sent. 3260 len. 44]: John Byrom , born in Manchester in the year 1691 , a man whose strength of thought and perception of truth greatly surpassed his poetic gifts , yet delighted so entirely in the poetic form that he wrote much and chiefly in it .
Parsing [sent. 3261 len. 39]: After leaving Cambridge , he gained his livelihood for some time by teaching a shorthand of his own invention , but was so distinguished as a man of learning generally that he was chosen an F.R.S. in 1723 .
Parsing [sent. 3262 len. 69]: Coming under the influence , probably through William Law , of the writings of Jacob Böhme , the marvellous shoemaker of Görlitz in Silesia , who lived in the time of our Shakspere , and heartily adopting many of his views , he has left us a number of religious poems , which are seldom so sweet in music as they are profound in the metaphysics of religion .
Parsing [sent. 3263 len. 57]: Here we have yet again a mystical thread running radiant athwart both warp and woof of our poetic web : the mystical thinker will ever be found the reviver of religious poetry ; and although some of the seed had come from afar both in time and space , Byrom 's verse is of indigenous growth .
Parsing [sent. 3264 len. 15]: Much of the thought of the present day will be found in his verses .
Parsing [sent. 3265 len. 9]: Here is a specimen of his metrical argumentation .
Parsing [sent. 3266 len. 17]: It is taken from a series of _ Meditations for every Day in Passion Week _ .
Parsing [sent. 3267 len. 2]: WEDNESDAY .
Parsing [sent. 3268 len. 12]: _ Christ satisfieth the justice of God by fulfilling all righteousness .
Parsing [sent. 3269 len. 54]: _ Justice demandeth satisfaction -- yes ; And ought to have it where injustice is : But there is none in God -- it can not mean Demand of justice where it has full reign : To dwell in man it rightfully demands , Such as he came from his Creator 's hands .
Parsing [sent. 3270 len. 53]: Man had departed from a righteous state , Which he at first must have , if God create : 'T is therefore called God 's righteousness , and must Be satisfied by man 's becoming just ; Must exercise good vengeance upon men , Till it regain its rights in them again .
Parsing [sent. 3271 len. 50]: This was the justice for which Christ became A man to satisfy its righteous claim ; Became Redeemer of the human race , That sin in them to justice might give place : To satisfy a just and righteous will , Is neither more nor less than to fulfil .
Parsing [sent. 3272 len. 20]: * * * * * Here are two stanzas of one of more mystical reflection : A PENITENTIAL SOLILOQUY .
Parsing [sent. 3273 len. 9]: What though no objects strike upon the sight !
Parsing [sent. 3274 len. 8]: Thy sacred presence is an inward light .
Parsing [sent. 3275 len. 9]: What though no sounds shall penetrate the ear !
Parsing [sent. 3276 len. 10]: To listening thought the voice of truth is clear .
Parsing [sent. 3277 len. 16]: Sincere devotion needs no outward shrine ; The centre of an humble soul is thine .
Parsing [sent. 3278 len. 5]: There may I worship !
Parsing [sent. 3279 len. 16]: and there mayst thou place Thy seat of mercy , and thy throne of grace !
Parsing [sent. 3280 len. 18]: Yea , fix , if Christ my advocate appear , The dread tribunal of thy justice there !
Parsing [sent. 3281 len. 18]: Let each vain thought , let each impure desire Meet in thy wrath with a consuming fire .
Parsing [sent. 3282 len. 9]: And here are two of more lyrical favour .
Parsing [sent. 3283 len. 9]: THE SOUL 'S TENDENCY TOWARDS ITS TRUE CENTRE .
Parsing [sent. 3284 len. 25]: Stones towards the earth descend ; Rivers to the ocean roll ; Every motion has some end : What is thine , beloved soul ?
Parsing [sent. 3285 len. 31]: `` Mine is , where my Saviour is ; There with him I hope to dwell : Jesu is the central bliss ; Love the force that doth impel . ''
Parsing [sent. 3286 len. 24]: Truly thou hast answered right : Now may heaven 's attractive grace Towards the source of thy delight Speed along thy quickening pace !
Parsing [sent. 3287 len. 28]: `` Thank thee for thy generous care : Heaven , that did the wish inspire , Through thy instrumental prayer , Plumes the wings of my desire .
Parsing [sent. 3288 len. 23]: `` Now , methinks , aloft I fly ; Now with angels bear a part : Glory be to God on high !
Parsing [sent. 3289 len. 7]: Peace to every Christian heart ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3290 len. 7]: THE ANSWER TO THE DESPONDING SOUL .
Parsing [sent. 3291 len. 25]: Cheer up , desponding soul ; Thy longing pleased I see : 'T is part of that great whole Wherewith I longed for thee .
Parsing [sent. 3292 len. 27]: Wherewith I longed for thee , And left my Father 's throne , From death to set thee free , To claim thee for my own .
Parsing [sent. 3293 len. 15]: To claim thee for my own , I suffered on the cross : O !
Parsing [sent. 3294 len. 13]: were my love but known , No soul could fear its loss .
Parsing [sent. 3295 len. 27]: No soul could fear its loss , But , filled with love divine , Would die on its own cross , And rise for ever mine .
Parsing [sent. 3296 len. 11]: Surely there is poetry as well as truth in this .
Parsing [sent. 3297 len. 16]: But , certainly in general , his thought is far in excess of his poetry .
Parsing [sent. 3298 len. 14]: Here are a few verses which I shall once more entitle DIVINE EPIGRAMS .
Parsing [sent. 3299 len. 38]: With peaceful mind thy race of duty run God nothing does , or suffers to be done , But what thou wouldst thyself , if thou couldst see Through all events of things as well as he .
Parsing [sent. 3300 len. 45]: * * * * * Think , and be careful what thou art within , For there is sin in the desire of sin : Think and be thankful , in a different case , For there is grace in the desire of grace .
Parsing [sent. 3301 len. 34]: * * * * * An heated fancy or imagination May be mistaken for an inspiration ; True ; but is this conclusion fair to make -- That inspiration must be all mistake ?
Parsing [sent. 3302 len. 18]: A pebble-stone is not a diamond : true ; But must a diamond be a pebble too ?
Parsing [sent. 3303 len. 37]: To own a God who does not speak to men , Is first to own , and then disown again ; Of all idolatry the total sum Is having gods that are both deaf and dumb .
Parsing [sent. 3304 len. 23]: * * * * * What is more tender than a mother 's love To the sweet infant fondling in her arms ?
Parsing [sent. 3305 len. 18]: What arguments need her compassion move To hear its cries , and help it in its harms ?
Parsing [sent. 3306 len. 36]: Now , if the tenderest mother were possessed Of all the love within her single breast Of all the mothers since the world began , 'T is nothing to the love of God to man .
Parsing [sent. 3307 len. 53]: * * * * * Faith , Hope , and Love were questioned what they thought Of future glory which Religion taught : Now Faith believed it firmly to be true , And Hope expected so to find it too : Love answered , smiling with a conscious glow , `` Believe ?
Parsing [sent. 3308 len. 2]: Expect ?
Parsing [sent. 3309 len. 10]: I _ know _ it to be so . ''
Parsing [sent. 3310 len. 3]: CHAPTER XX .
Parsing [sent. 3311 len. 6]: THE ROOTS OF THE HILLS .
Parsing [sent. 3312 len. 27]: In the poems of James Thomson , we find two hymns to the God of Creation -- one in blank verse , the other in stanzas .
Parsing [sent. 3313 len. 13]: They are of the kind which from him we should look for .
Parsing [sent. 3314 len. 24]: The one in blank verse , which is as an epilogue to his great poem , _ The Seasons _ , I prefer .
Parsing [sent. 3315 len. 6]: We owe much to Thomson .
Parsing [sent. 3316 len. 47]: Born -LRB- in Scotland -RRB- in the year 1700 , he is the leading priest in a solemn procession to find God -- not in the laws by which he has ordered his creation , but in the beauty which is the outcome of those laws .
Parsing [sent. 3317 len. 23]: I do not say there is much of the relation of man to nature in his writing ; but thitherward it tends .
Parsing [sent. 3318 len. 41]: He is true about the outsides of God ; and in Thomson we begin to feel that the revelation of God as _ meaning _ and therefore _ being _ the loveliness of nature , is about to be recognized .
Parsing [sent. 3319 len. 57]: I do not say -- to change my simile -- that he is the first visible root in our literature whence we can follow the outburst of the flowers and foliage of our delight in nature : I could show a hundred fibres leading from the depths of our old literature up to the great root .
Parsing [sent. 3320 len. 45]: Nor is it surprising that , with his age about him , he too should be found tending to magnify , not God 's Word , but his works , above all his name : we have beauty for loveliness ; beneficence for tenderness .
Parsing [sent. 3321 len. 31]: I have wondered whether one great part of Napoleon 's mission was not to wake people from this idolatry of the power of God to the adoration of his love .
Parsing [sent. 3322 len. 37]: The _ Hymn _ holds a kind of middle place between the _ Morning Hymn _ in the 5th Book of the _ Paradise Lost _ and the _ Hymn in the Vale of Chamouni _ .
Parsing [sent. 3323 len. 17]: It would be interesting and instructive to compare the three ; but we have not time .
Parsing [sent. 3324 len. 12]: Thomson has been influenced by Milton , and Coleridge by both .
Parsing [sent. 3325 len. 18]: We have delight in Milton ; art in Thomson ; heart , including both , in Coleridge .
Parsing [sent. 3326 len. 2]: HYMN .
Parsing [sent. 3327 len. 16]: These , as they change , Almighty Father , these Are but the varied God .
Parsing [sent. 3328 len. 8]: The rolling year Is full of thee .
Parsing [sent. 3329 len. 14]: Forth in the pleasing Spring Thy beauty walks , thy tenderness and love .
Parsing [sent. 3330 len. 29]: Wide flush the fields ; the softening air is balm ; Echo the mountains round ; the forest smiles ; And every sense and every heart is joy .
Parsing [sent. 3331 len. 15]: Then comes thy glory in the Summer months , With light and heat refulgent .
Parsing [sent. 3332 len. 40]: Then thy sun Shoots full perfection through the swelling year And oft thy voice in dreadful thunder speaks , And oft at dawn , deep noon , or falling eve , By brooks and groves , in hollow-whispering gales .
Parsing [sent. 3333 len. 14]: -LSB- 159 -RSB- A yellow-floating pomp , thy bounty shines In Autumn unconfined .
Parsing [sent. 3334 len. 32]: Thrown from thy lap , Profuse o'er nature , falls the lucid shower Of beamy fruits ; and , in a radiant stream , Into the stores of sterile Winter pours .
Parsing [sent. 3335 len. 5]: In winter awful thou !
Parsing [sent. 3336 len. 13]: with clouds and storms Around thee thrown -- tempest o'er tempest rolled .
Parsing [sent. 3337 len. 3]: Majestic darkness !
Parsing [sent. 3338 len. 25]: on the whirlwind 's wing Riding sublime , thou bidst the world adore , -LSB- 160 -RSB- And humblest nature with thy northern blast .
Parsing [sent. 3339 len. 3]: Mysterious round !
Parsing [sent. 3340 len. 13]: what skill , what force divine Deep felt , in these appear !
Parsing [sent. 3341 len. 20]: a simple train , Yet so delightful mixed , with such kind art , Such beauty and beneficence combined !
Parsing [sent. 3342 len. 7]: Shade unperceived so softening into shade !
Parsing [sent. 3343 len. 19]: And all so forming an harmonious whole , That , as they still succeed , they ravish still .
Parsing [sent. 3344 len. 8]: * * * * * Nature attend !
Parsing [sent. 3345 len. 27]: Join , every living soul , Beneath the spacious temple of the sky -- In adoration join ; and , ardent , raise One general song !
Parsing [sent. 3346 len. 19]: To him , ye vocal gales , Breathe soft , whose spirit in your freshness breathes ; Oh !
Parsing [sent. 3347 len. 57]: talk of him in solitary glooms , Where , o'er the rock , the scarcely waving pine Fills the brown shade with a religious awe ; And ye , whose bolder note is heard afar , Who shake the astonished world , lift high to heaven The impetuous song , and say from whom you rage .
Parsing [sent. 3348 len. 23]: His praise , ye brooks , attune , -- ye trembling rills , And let me catch it as I muse along .
Parsing [sent. 3349 len. 54]: Ye headlong torrents , rapid and profound ; Ye softer floods , that lead the humid maze Along the vale ; and thou , majestic main , A secret world of wonders in thyself , Sound his stupendous praise , whose greater voice Or bids you roar , or bids your roarings fall .
Parsing [sent. 3350 len. 32]: Soft roll your incense , herbs , and fruits , and flowers , In mingled clouds to him whose sun exalts , Whose breath perfumes you , and whose pencil paints .
Parsing [sent. 3351 len. 31]: Ye forests , bend , ye harvests , wave to him ; Breathe your still song into the reaper 's heart , As home he goes beneath the joyous moon .
Parsing [sent. 3352 len. 12]: * * * * * Bleat out afresh , ye hills !
Parsing [sent. 3353 len. 31]: ye mossy rocks , Retain the sound ; the broad responsive low , Ye valleys raise ; for the great Shepherd reigns , And his unsuffering kingdom yet will come .
Parsing [sent. 3354 len. 33]: * * * * * Ye chief , for whom the whole creation smiles , At once the head , the heart , and tongue of all , Crown the great hymn !
Parsing [sent. 3355 len. 47]: in swarming cities vast , Assembled men , to the deep organ join The long-resounding voice , oft breaking clear , At solemn pauses , through the swelling base ; And , as each mingling flame increases each , In one united ardour rise to heaven .
Parsing [sent. 3356 len. 81]: * * * * * Should fate command me to the farthest verge Of the green earth , to distant barbarous climes , Rivers unknown to song , where first the sun Gilds Indian mountains , or his setting beam Flames on the Atlantic isles , 't is nought to me , Since God is ever present , ever felt , In the void waste as in the city full ; And where he vital breathes there must be joy .
Parsing [sent. 3357 len. 43]: * * * * * The worship of intellectual power in laws and inventions is the main delight of the song ; not the living presence of creative love , which never sings its own praises , but spends itself in giving .
Parsing [sent. 3358 len. 40]: Still , although there has passed away a glory from the world of song , although the fervour of childlike worship has vanished for a season , there are signs in these verses of a new dawn of devotion .
Parsing [sent. 3359 len. 45]: Even the exclusive and therefore blind worship of science will , when it has turned the coil of the ascending spiral , result in a new song to `` him that made heaven and earth and the sea and the fountains of waters . ''
Parsing [sent. 3360 len. 16]: But first , for a long time , the worship of power will go on .
Parsing [sent. 3361 len. 29]: There is one sonnet by Kirke White , eighty-five years younger than Thomson , which is quite pagan in its mode of glorifying the power of the Deity .
Parsing [sent. 3362 len. 77]: But about the same time when Thomson 's _ Seasons _ was published , which was in 1730 , the third year of George II. , that life which had burned on in the hidden corners of the church in spite of the worldliness and sensuality of its rulers , began to show a flame destined to enlarge and spread until it should have lighted up the mass with an outburst of Christian faith and hope .
Parsing [sent. 3363 len. 45]: I refer to the movement called Methodism , in the midst of which , at an early stage of its history , arose the directing energies of John Wesley , a man sent of God to deepen at once and purify its motive influences .
Parsing [sent. 3364 len. 65]: What he and his friends taught , would , I presume , in its essence , amount mainly to this : that acquiescence in the doctrines of the church is no fulfilment of duty -- or anything , indeed , short of an obedient recognition of personal relation to God , who has sent every man the message of present salvation in his Son .
Parsing [sent. 3365 len. 16]: A new life began to bud and blossom from the dry stem of the church .
Parsing [sent. 3366 len. 26]: The spirit moved upon the waters of feeling , and the new undulation broke on the shores of thought in an outburst of new song .
Parsing [sent. 3367 len. 22]: For while John Wesley roused the hearts of the people to sing , his brother Charles put songs in their mouths .
Parsing [sent. 3368 len. 33]: I do not say that many of these songs possess much literary merit , but many of them are real lyrics : they have that essential element , song , in them .
Parsing [sent. 3369 len. 11]: The following , however , is a very fine poem .
Parsing [sent. 3370 len. 39]: That certain expressions in it may not seem offensive , it is necessary to keep the allegory of Jacob and the Angel in full view -- even better in view , perhaps , than the writer does himself .
Parsing [sent. 3371 len. 3]: WRESTLING JACOB .
Parsing [sent. 3372 len. 17]: Come , O thou traveller unknown , Whom still I hold , but can not see !
Parsing [sent. 3373 len. 14]: My company before is gone , And I am left alone with thee !
Parsing [sent. 3374 len. 17]: With thee all night I mean to stay , And wrestle till the break of day !
Parsing [sent. 3375 len. 33]: I need not tell thee who I am , My misery or sin declare ; Thyself hast called me by my name : Look on my hands , and read it there !
Parsing [sent. 3376 len. 11]: But who , I ask thee , who art thou ?
Parsing [sent. 3377 len. 10]: Tell me thy name , and tell me now .
Parsing [sent. 3378 len. 5]: In vain thou struggles !
Parsing [sent. 3379 len. 11]: to get free : I never will unloose my hold .
Parsing [sent. 3380 len. 9]: Art thou the man that died for me ?
Parsing [sent. 3381 len. 7]: The secret of thy love unfold .
Parsing [sent. 3382 len. 17]: Wrestling , I will not let thee go Till I thy name , thy nature know .
Parsing [sent. 3383 len. 19]: * * * * * What though my sinking flesh complain , And murmur to contend so long !
Parsing [sent. 3384 len. 33]: I rise superior to my pain : When I am weak , then I am strong ; And when my all of strength shall fail , I shall with the God-man prevail .
Parsing [sent. 3385 len. 53]: My strength is gone ; my nature dies ; I sink beneath thy weighty hand : Faint to revive , and fall to rise ; I fall , and yet by faith I stand -- I stand , and will not let thee go Till I thy name , thy nature know .
Parsing [sent. 3386 len. 34]: Yield to me now , for I am weak , But confident in self-despair ; Speak to my heart , in blessings speak ; Be conquered by my instant -LSB- 161 -RSB- prayer .
Parsing [sent. 3387 len. 18]: Speak , or thou never hence shalt move , And tell me if thy name is Love .
Parsing [sent. 3388 len. 4]: 'T is Love !
Parsing [sent. 3389 len. 4]: 't is Love !
Parsing [sent. 3390 len. 5]: Thou diedst for me !
Parsing [sent. 3391 len. 8]: I hear thy whisper in my heart !
Parsing [sent. 3392 len. 14]: The morning breaks ; the shadows flee : Pure universal Love thou art !
Parsing [sent. 3393 len. 18]: To me , to all , thy bowels move : Thy nature and thy name is Love !
Parsing [sent. 3394 len. 50]: My prayer hath power with God ; the grace Unspeakable I now receive ; Through faith I see thee face to face -- I see thee face to face , and live : In vain I have not wept and strove ; Thy nature and thy name is Love .
Parsing [sent. 3395 len. 18]: I know thee , Saviour -- who thou art -- Jesus , the feeble sinner 's friend !
Parsing [sent. 3396 len. 17]: Nor wilt thou with the night depart , But stay and love me to the end !
Parsing [sent. 3397 len. 14]: Thy mercies never shall remove : Thy nature and thy name is Love !
Parsing [sent. 3398 len. 51]: * * * * * Contented now , upon my thigh I halt till life 's short journey end ; All helplessness , all weakness , I On thee alone for strength depend ; Nor have I power from thee to move : Thy nature and thy name is Love .
Parsing [sent. 3399 len. 51]: Lame as I am , I take the prey ; Hell , earth , and sin , with ease o'ercome ; I leap for joy , pursue my way , And as a bounding hart fly home ; Through all eternity to prove Thy nature and thy name is Love .
Parsing [sent. 3400 len. 25]: It seems to me that the art with which his very difficult end in the management of the allegory is reached , is admirable .
Parsing [sent. 3401 len. 6]: I have omitted three stanzas .
Parsing [sent. 3402 len. 9]: I can not give much from William Cowper .
Parsing [sent. 3403 len. 36]: His poems -- graceful always , and often devout even when playful -- have few amongst them that are expressly religious , while the best of his hymns are known to every reader of such .
Parsing [sent. 3404 len. 39]: Born in 1731 , he was greatly influenced by the narrow theology that prevailed in his circle ; and most of his hymns are marred by the exclusiveness which belonged to the system and not to the man .
Parsing [sent. 3405 len. 38]: There is little of it in the following : -- Far from the world , O Lord , I flee , From strife and tumult far ; From scenes where Satan wages still His most successful war .
Parsing [sent. 3406 len. 27]: The calm retreat , the silent shade , With prayer and praise agree , And seem by thy sweet bounty made For those who follow thee .
Parsing [sent. 3407 len. 31]: There if thy spirit touch the soul , And grace her mean abode , Oh with what peace , and joy , and love , She communes with her God !
Parsing [sent. 3408 len. 26]: There , like the nightingale , she pours Her solitary lays , Nor asks a witness of her song , Nor thirsts for human praise .
Parsing [sent. 3409 len. 28]: Author and guardian of my life , Sweet source of light divine , And -- all harmonious names in one -- My Saviour , thou art mine !
Parsing [sent. 3410 len. 29]: What thanks I owe thee , and what love -- A boundless , endless store -- Shall echo through the realms above When time shall be no more .
Parsing [sent. 3411 len. 63]: Sad as was Cowper 's history , with the vapours of a low insanity , if not always filling his garden , yet ever brooding on the hill-tops of his horizon , he was , through his faith in God , however darkened by the introversions of a neat , poverty-stricken theology , yet able to lead his life to the end .
Parsing [sent. 3412 len. 82]: It is delightful to discover that , when science , which is the anatomy of nature , had poisoned the theology of the country , in creating a demand for clean-cut theory in infinite affairs , the loveliness and truth of the countenance of living nature could calm the mind which this theology had irritated to the very borders of madness , and give a peace and hope which the man was altogether right in attributing to the Spirit of God .
Parsing [sent. 3413 len. 31]: How many have been thus comforted , who knew not , like Wordsworth , the immediate channel of their comfort ; or even , with Cowper , recognized its source !
Parsing [sent. 3414 len. 6]: God gives while men sleep .
Parsing [sent. 3415 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXI .
Parsing [sent. 3416 len. 4]: THE NEW VISION .
Parsing [sent. 3417 len. 27]: William Blake , the painter of many strange and fantastic but often powerful -- sometimes very beautiful pictures -- wrote poems of an equally remarkable kind .
Parsing [sent. 3418 len. 26]: Some of them are as lovely as they are careless , while many present a curious contrast in the apparent incoherence of the simplest language .
Parsing [sent. 3419 len. 16]: He was born in 1757 , towards the close of the reign of George II .
Parsing [sent. 3420 len. 39]: Possibly if he had been sent to an age more capable of understanding him , his genius would not have been tempted to utter itself with such a wildness as appears to indicate hopeless indifference to being understood .
Parsing [sent. 3421 len. 34]: We can not tell sometimes whether to attribute the bewilderment the poems cause in us to a mysticism run wild , or to regard it as the reflex of madness in the writer .
Parsing [sent. 3422 len. 15]: Here is a lyrical gem , however , although not cut with mathematical precision .
Parsing [sent. 3423 len. 2]: DAYBREAK .
Parsing [sent. 3424 len. 67]: To find the western path , Right through the gates of wrath I urge my way ; Sweet morning leads me on : With soft repentant moan , I see the break of day The war of swords and spears , Melted by dewy tears , Exhales on high ; The sun is freed from fears , And with soft grateful tears , Ascends the sky .
Parsing [sent. 3425 len. 18]: The following is full of truth most quaintly expressed , with a homeliness of phrase quite delicious .
Parsing [sent. 3426 len. 28]: It is one of the _ Songs of Innocence _ , published , as we learn from Gilchrist 's Life of Blake , in the year 1789 .
Parsing [sent. 3427 len. 18]: They were engraved on copper with illustrations by Blake , and printed and bound by his wife .
Parsing [sent. 3428 len. 24]: When we consider them in respect of the time when they were produced , we find them marvellous for their originality and simplicity .
Parsing [sent. 3429 len. 5]: ON ANOTHER 'S SORROW .
Parsing [sent. 3430 len. 14]: Can I see another 's woe , And not be in sorrow too ?
Parsing [sent. 3431 len. 14]: Can I see another 's grief , And not seek for kind relief ?
Parsing [sent. 3432 len. 15]: Can I see a falling tear , And not feel my sorrow 's share ?
Parsing [sent. 3433 len. 14]: Can a father see his child Weep , nor be with sorrow filled ?
Parsing [sent. 3434 len. 14]: Can a mother sit and hear An infant groan , an infant fear ?
Parsing [sent. 3435 len. 9]: No , no ; never can it be !
Parsing [sent. 3436 len. 7]: Never , never can it be !
Parsing [sent. 3437 len. 46]: And can he , who smiles on all , Hear the wren , with sorrows small -- Hear the small bird 's grief and care , Hear the woes that infants bear , And not sit beside the nest , Pouring pity in their breast ?
Parsing [sent. 3438 len. 14]: And not sit the cradle near , Weeping tear on infant 's tear ?
Parsing [sent. 3439 len. 14]: And not sit both night and day , Wiping all our tears away ?
Parsing [sent. 3440 len. 4]: Oh , no !
Parsing [sent. 3441 len. 5]: never can it be !
Parsing [sent. 3442 len. 7]: Never , never can it be !
Parsing [sent. 3443 len. 28]: He doth give his joy to all ; He becomes an infant small ; He becomes a man of woe ; He doth feel the sorrow too .
Parsing [sent. 3444 len. 30]: Think not thou canst sigh a sigh , And thy Maker is not by ; Think not thou canst weep a tear , And thy Maker is not near .
Parsing [sent. 3445 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 3446 len. 30]: he gives to us his joy , That our grief he may destroy : Till our grief is fled and gone , He doth sit by us and moan .
Parsing [sent. 3447 len. 10]: There is our mystic yet again leading the way .
Parsing [sent. 3448 len. 30]: A supreme regard for science , and the worship of power , go hand in hand : that knowledge is power has been esteemed the grandest incitement to study .
Parsing [sent. 3449 len. 28]: Yet the antidote to the disproportionate cultivation of science , is simply power in its crude form -- breaking out , that is , as brute force .
Parsing [sent. 3450 len. 53]: When science , isolated and glorified , has produced a contempt , not only for vulgar errors , but for the truths which are incapable of scientific proof , then , as we see in the French Revolution , the wild beast in man breaks from its den , and chaos returns .
Parsing [sent. 3451 len. 21]: But all the noblest minds in Europe looked for grand things in the aurora of this uprising of the people .
Parsing [sent. 3452 len. 23]: To the terrible disappointment that followed , we are indebted for the training of Wordsworth to the priesthood of nature 's temple .
Parsing [sent. 3453 len. 26]: So was he possessed with the hope of a coming deliverance for the nations , that he spent many months in France during the Revolution .
Parsing [sent. 3454 len. 11]: At length he was forced to seek safety at home .
Parsing [sent. 3455 len. 13]: Dejected even to hopelessness for a time , he believed in nothing .
Parsing [sent. 3456 len. 27]: How could there be a God that ruled in the earth when such a rising sun of promise was permitted to set in such a sea !
Parsing [sent. 3457 len. 36]: But for man to worship himself is a far more terrible thing than that blood should flow like water : the righteous plague of God allowed things to go as they would for a time .
Parsing [sent. 3458 len. 46]: But the power of God came upon Wordsworth -- I can not say as it had never come before , but with an added insight which made him recognize in the fresh gift all that he had known and felt of such in the past .
Parsing [sent. 3459 len. 29]: To him , as to Cowper , the benignities of nature restored peace and calmness and hope -- sufficient to enable him to look back and gather wisdom .
Parsing [sent. 3460 len. 12]: He was first troubled , then quieted , and then taught .
Parsing [sent. 3461 len. 26]: Such presence of the Father has been an infinitely more active power in the redemption of men than men have yet become capable of perceiving .
Parsing [sent. 3462 len. 30]: The divine expressions of Nature , that is , the face of the Father therein visible , began to heal the plague which the worship of knowledge had bred .
Parsing [sent. 3463 len. 23]: And the power of her teaching grew from comfort to prayer , as will be seen in the poem I shall give .
Parsing [sent. 3464 len. 33]: Higher than all that Nature can do in the way of direct lessoning , is the production of such holy moods as result in hope , conscience of duty , and supplication .
Parsing [sent. 3465 len. 28]: Those who have never felt it have to be told there is in her such a power -- yielding to which , the meek inherit the earth .
Parsing [sent. 3466 len. 4]: NINTH EVENING VOLUNTARY .
Parsing [sent. 3467 len. 11]: _ Composed upon an evening of extraordinary splendour and beauty .
Parsing [sent. 3468 len. 48]: _ I. Had this effulgence disappeared With flying haste , I might have sent Among the speechless clouds a look Of blank astonishment ; But 't is endued with power to stay , And sanctify one closing day , That frail Mortality may see -- What is ?
Parsing [sent. 3469 len. 11]: -- ah no , but what _ can _ be !
Parsing [sent. 3470 len. 49]: Time was when field and watery cove With modulated echoes rang , While choirs of fervent angels sang Their vespers in the grove ; Or , crowning , star-like , each some sovereign height , Warbled , for heaven above and earth below , Strains suitable to both .
Parsing [sent. 3471 len. 41]: -- Such holy rite , Methinks , if audibly repeated now From hill or valley could not move Sublimer transport , purer love , Than doth this silent spectacle -- the gleam -- The shadow -- and the peace supreme !
Parsing [sent. 3472 len. 2]: II .
Parsing [sent. 3473 len. 26]: No sound is uttered , -- but a deep And solemn harmony pervades The hollow vale from steep to steep , And penetrates the glades .
Parsing [sent. 3474 len. 24]: Far distant images draw nigh , Called forth by wondrous potency Of beamy radiance , that imbues Whate'er it strikes with gem-like hues .
Parsing [sent. 3475 len. 23]: In vision exquisitely clear , Herds range along the mountain side , And glistening antlers are descried , And gilded flocks appear .
Parsing [sent. 3476 len. 9]: Thine is the tranquil hour , purpureal Eve !
Parsing [sent. 3477 len. 23]: But long as godlike wish or hope divine Informs my spirit , ne'er can I believe That this magnificence is wholly thine !
Parsing [sent. 3478 len. 30]: From worlds nor quickened by the sun A portion of the gift is won ; An intermingling of heaven 's pomp is spread On ground which British shepherds tread !
Parsing [sent. 3479 len. 2]: III .
Parsing [sent. 3480 len. 53]: And if there be whom broken ties Afflict , or injuries assail , Yon hazy ridges to their eyes Present a glorious scale -LSB- 162 -RSB- Climbing suffused with sunny air , To stop -- no record hath told where ; And tempting Fancy to ascend , And with immortal spirits blend !
Parsing [sent. 3481 len. 9]: -- Wings at my shoulders seem to play !
Parsing [sent. 3482 len. 20]: But , rooted here , I stand and gaze On those bright steps that heavenward raise Their practicable way .
Parsing [sent. 3483 len. 21]: Come forth , ye drooping old men , look abroad , And see to what fair countries ye are bound !
Parsing [sent. 3484 len. 49]: And if some traveller , weary of his road , Hath slept since noontide on the grassy ground , Ye genii , to his covert speed , And wake him with such gentle heed As may attune his soul to meet the dower Bestowed on this transcendent hour .
Parsing [sent. 3485 len. 2]: IV .
Parsing [sent. 3486 len. 23]: Such hues from their celestial urn Were wont to stream before mine eye Where'er it wandered in the morn Of blissful infancy .
Parsing [sent. 3487 len. 8]: This glimpse of glory , why renewed ?
Parsing [sent. 3488 len. 24]: Nay , rather speak with gratitude ; For , if a vestige of those gleams Survived , 't was only in my dreams .
Parsing [sent. 3489 len. 3]: Dread Power !
Parsing [sent. 3490 len. 78]: whom peace and calmness serve No less than nature 's threatening voice , If aught unworthy be my choice , From THEE if I would swerve ; Oh , let thy grace remind me of the light Full early lost , and fruitlessly deplored ; Which , at this moment , on my waking sight Appears to shine , by miracle restored : My soul , though yet confined to earth , Rejoices in a second birth !
Parsing [sent. 3491 len. 17]: -- 'T is past ; the visionary splendour fades ; And night approaches with her shades .
Parsing [sent. 3492 len. 57]: Although I have mentioned Wordsworth before Coleridge because he was two years older , yet Coleridge had much to do with the opening of Wordsworth 's eyes to such visions ; as , indeed , more than any man in our times , he has opened the eyes of the English people to see wonderful things .
Parsing [sent. 3493 len. 41]: There is little of a directly religious kind in his poetry ; yet we find in him what we miss in Wordsworth , an inclined plane from the revelation in nature to the culminating revelation in the Son of Man .
Parsing [sent. 3494 len. 24]: Somehow , I say , perhaps because we find it in his prose , we feel more of this in Coleridge 's verse .
Parsing [sent. 3495 len. 63]: Coleridge is a sage , and Wordsworth is a seer ; yet when the sage sees , that is , when , like the son of Beor , he falls into a trance having his eyes open , or , when feeling and sight are one and philosophy is in abeyance , the ecstasy is even loftier in Coleridge than in Wordsworth .
Parsing [sent. 3496 len. 20]: In their highest moods they seem almost to change places -- Wordsworth to become sage , and Coleridge seer .
Parsing [sent. 3497 len. 25]: Perhaps the grandest hymn of praise which man , the mouth-piece of Nature , utters for her , is the hymn of Mont Blanc .
Parsing [sent. 3498 len. 11]: HYMN _ Before sunrise , in the Vale of Chamouni .
Parsing [sent. 3499 len. 31]: _ Hast thou a charm to stay the morning star In his steep course -- so long he seems to pause On thy bald awful head , O sovran Blanc ?
Parsing [sent. 3500 len. 17]: The Arve and Arveiron at thy base Rave ceaselessly ; but thou , most awful Form !
Parsing [sent. 3501 len. 12]: Risest from forth thy silent sea of pines , How silently !
Parsing [sent. 3502 len. 28]: Around thee and above Deep is the air and dark , substantial , black , An ebon mass : methinks thou piercest it As with a wedge !
Parsing [sent. 3503 len. 22]: But when I look again , It is thine own calm home , thy crystal shrine , Thy habitation from eternity !
Parsing [sent. 3504 len. 6]: O dread and silent Mount !
Parsing [sent. 3505 len. 29]: I gazed upon thee Till thou , still present to the bodily sense , Didst vanish from my thought : entranced in prayer I worshipped the Invisible alone .
Parsing [sent. 3506 len. 70]: Yet , like some sweet beguiling melody , So sweet , we know not we are listening to it , Thou , the meanwhile , wast blending with my thought , Yea , with my life and life 's own secret joy ; Till the dilating soul , enwrapt , transfused , Into the mighty vision passing -- there As in her natural form , swelled vast to Heaven !
Parsing [sent. 3507 len. 5]: Awake , my soul !
Parsing [sent. 3508 len. 7]: Not only passive praise Thou owest !
Parsing [sent. 3509 len. 12]: Not alone these swelling tears , Mute thanks and secret ecstasy !
Parsing [sent. 3510 len. 7]: Awake , Voice of sweet song !
Parsing [sent. 3511 len. 7]: Awake , my heart , awake !
Parsing [sent. 3512 len. 11]: Green vales and icy cliffs , all join my hymn .
Parsing [sent. 3513 len. 14]: Thou first and chief , sole sovran -LSB- 163 -RSB- of the Vale !
Parsing [sent. 3514 len. 32]: O struggling with the darkness all the night , And visited all night by troops of stars , -LSB- 164 -RSB- Or when they climb the sky or when they sink !
Parsing [sent. 3515 len. 22]: Companion of the morning-star at dawn , Thyself earth 's rosy star , and of the dawn -LSB- 165 -RSB- Co-herald !
Parsing [sent. 3516 len. 9]: wake , O wake , and utter praise !
Parsing [sent. 3517 len. 9]: Who sank thy sunless pillars deep in earth ?
Parsing [sent. 3518 len. 8]: Who filled thy countenance with rosy light ?
Parsing [sent. 3519 len. 8]: Who made thee parent of perpetual streams ?
Parsing [sent. 3520 len. 10]: And you , ye five wild torrents fiercely glad !
Parsing [sent. 3521 len. 41]: Who called you forth from night and utter death , From dark and icy caverns called you forth , -LSB- 166 -RSB- Down those precipitous , black , jagged rocks , For ever shattered , and the same for ever ?
Parsing [sent. 3522 len. 27]: Who gave you your invulnerable life , Your strength , your speed , your fury , and your joy , Unceasing thunder , and eternal foam ?
Parsing [sent. 3523 len. 19]: And who commanded -- and the silence came -- Here let the billows stiffen , and have rest ?
Parsing [sent. 3524 len. 6]: -LSB- 167 -RSB- Ye ice-falls !
Parsing [sent. 3525 len. 32]: ye that from the mountain 's brow Adown enormous ravines slope amain -- Torrents , methinks , that heard a mighty voice , And stopped at once amid their maddest plunge !
Parsing [sent. 3526 len. 4]: -- Motionless torrents !
Parsing [sent. 3527 len. 3]: silent cataracts !
Parsing [sent. 3528 len. 15]: Who made you glorious as the gates of heaven Beneath the keen full moon ?
Parsing [sent. 3529 len. 9]: Who bade the sun Clothe you with rainbows ?
Parsing [sent. 3530 len. 15]: Who , with living flowers Of loveliest blue , spread garlands at your feet ?
Parsing [sent. 3531 len. 4]: -- _ God !
Parsing [sent. 3532 len. 13]: _ let the torrents , like a shout of nations , Answer !
Parsing [sent. 3533 len. 9]: and let the ice-plains echo , _ God !
Parsing [sent. 3534 len. 4]: _ _ God !
Parsing [sent. 3535 len. 10]: _ sing , ye meadow-streams , with gladsome voice !
Parsing [sent. 3536 len. 10]: Ye pine-groves , with your soft and soul-like sounds !
Parsing [sent. 3537 len. 23]: And they too have a voice , yon piles of snow , And in their perilous fall shall thunder , _ God !
Parsing [sent. 3538 len. 10]: _ Ye living flowers that skirt the eternal frost !
Parsing [sent. 3539 len. 10]: Ye wild goats sporting round the eagle 's nest !
Parsing [sent. 3540 len. 8]: Ye eagles , playmates of the mountain-storm !
Parsing [sent. 3541 len. 10]: Ye lightnings , the dread arrows of the clouds !
Parsing [sent. 3542 len. 8]: Ye signs and wonders of the element !
Parsing [sent. 3543 len. 11]: Utter forth God , and fill the hills with praise .
Parsing [sent. 3544 len. 6]: Thou too , hoar Mount !
Parsing [sent. 3545 len. 42]: with thy sky-pointing peaks , Oft from whose -LSB- 168 -RSB- feet the avalanche , unheard , Shoots downward , glittering through the pure serene Into the depth of clouds that veil thy breast -- Thou too again , stupendous Mountain !
Parsing [sent. 3546 len. 40]: thou That , as I raise my head , awhile bowed low In adoration -- upward from thy base Slow-travelling with dim eyes suffused with tears -- Solemnly seemest , like a vapoury cloud , To rise before me !
Parsing [sent. 3547 len. 16]: rise , O ever rise ; Rise like a cloud of incense from the earth !
Parsing [sent. 3548 len. 8]: Thou kingly spirit throned among the hills !
Parsing [sent. 3549 len. 8]: Thou dread ambassador from earth to heaven !
Parsing [sent. 3550 len. 3]: Great hierarch !
Parsing [sent. 3551 len. 27]: tell thou the silent sky , And tell the stars , and tell yon rising sun , Earth , with her thousand voices , praises God .
Parsing [sent. 3552 len. 32]: Here is one little poem I think most valuable , both from its fulness of meaning , and the form , as clear as condensed , in which that is embodied .
Parsing [sent. 3553 len. 9]: ON AN INFANT _ Which died before baptism .
Parsing [sent. 3554 len. 20]: _ '' _ Be _ rather than _ be called _ a child of God , '' Death whispered .
Parsing [sent. 3555 len. 28]: With assenting nod , Its head upon its mother 's breast The baby bowed without demur -- Of the kingdom of the blest Possessor , not inheritor .
Parsing [sent. 3556 len. 13]: Next the father let me place the gifted son , Hartley Coleridge .
Parsing [sent. 3557 len. 11]: He was born in 1796 , and died in 1849 .
Parsing [sent. 3558 len. 30]: Strange , wayward , and in one respect faulty , as his life was , his poetry -- strange , and exceedingly wayward too -- is often very lovely .
Parsing [sent. 3559 len. 18]: The following sonnet is all I can find room for : -- `` SHE LOVED MUCH . ''
Parsing [sent. 3560 len. 8]: She sat and wept beside his feet .
Parsing [sent. 3561 len. 45]: The weight Of sin oppressed her heart ; for all the blame , And the poor malice of the worldly shame , To her was past , extinct , and out of date ; Only the _ sin _ remained -- the leprous state .
Parsing [sent. 3562 len. 26]: She would be melted by the heat of love , By fires far fiercer than are blown to prove And purge the silver ore adulterate .
Parsing [sent. 3563 len. 40]: She sat and wept , and with her untressed hair Still wiped the feet she was so blest to touch ; And he wiped off the soiling of despair From her sweet soul , because she loved so much .
Parsing [sent. 3564 len. 21]: I am a sinner , full of doubts and fears : Make me a humble thing of love and tears .
Parsing [sent. 3565 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXII .
Parsing [sent. 3566 len. 6]: THE FERVOUR OF THE IMPLICIT .
Parsing [sent. 3567 len. 5]: INSIGHT OF THE HEART .
Parsing [sent. 3568 len. 51]: The late Dean Milman , born in 1791 , best known by his very valuable labours in history , may be taken as representing a class of writers in whom the poetic fire is ever on the point , and only on the point , of breaking into a flame .
Parsing [sent. 3569 len. 34]: His composition is admirable -- refined , scholarly , sometimes rich and even gorgeous in expression -- yet lacking that radiance of the unutterable to which the loftiest words owe their grandest power .
Parsing [sent. 3570 len. 26]: Perhaps the best representative of his style is the hymn on the Incarnation , in his dramatic poem , _ The Fall of Jerusulem _ .
Parsing [sent. 3571 len. 9]: But as an extract it is tolerably known .
Parsing [sent. 3572 len. 14]: I prefer giving one from his few _ Hymns for Church Service _ .
Parsing [sent. 3573 len. 5]: EIGHTEENTH SUNDAY AFTER TRINITY .
Parsing [sent. 3574 len. 20]: When God came down from heaven -- the living God -- What signs and wonders marked his stately way ?
Parsing [sent. 3575 len. 10]: Brake out the winds in music where he trod ?
Parsing [sent. 3576 len. 10]: Shone o'er the heavens a brighter , softer day ?
Parsing [sent. 3577 len. 41]: The dumb began to speak , the blind to see , And the lame leaped , and pain and paleness fled ; The mourner 's sunken eye grew bright with glee , And from the tomb awoke the wondering dead .
Parsing [sent. 3578 len. 20]: When God went back to heaven -- the living God -- Rode he the heavens upon a fiery car ?
Parsing [sent. 3579 len. 7]: Waved seraph-wings along his glorious road ?
Parsing [sent. 3580 len. 9]: Stood still to wonder each bright wandering star ?
Parsing [sent. 3581 len. 45]: Upon the cross he hung , and bowed his head , And prayed for them that smote , and them that curst ; And , drop by drop , his slow life-blood was shed , And his last hour of suffering was his worst .
Parsing [sent. 3582 len. 30]: _ The Christian Year _ of the Rev. John Keble -LRB- born in 1800 -RRB- is perhaps better known in England than any other work of similar church character .
Parsing [sent. 3583 len. 17]: I must confess I have never been able to enter into the enthusiasm of its admirers .
Parsing [sent. 3584 len. 35]: Excellent , both in regard of their literary and religious merits , true in feeling and thorough in finish , the poems always remind me of Berlin work in iron -- hard and delicate .
Parsing [sent. 3585 len. 12]: Here is a portion of one of the best of them .
Parsing [sent. 3586 len. 3]: ST. MATTHEW .
Parsing [sent. 3587 len. 128]: Ye hermits blest , ye holy maids , The nearest heaven on earth , Who talk with God in shadowy glades , Free from rude care and mirth ; To whom some viewless teacher brings The secret lore of rural things , The moral of each fleeting cloud and gale , The whispers from above , that haunt the twilight vale : Say , when in pity ye have gazed On the wreath 'd smoke afar , That o'er some town , like mist upraised , Hung hiding sun and star ; Then as ye turned your weary eye To the green earth and open sky , Were ye not fain to doubt how Faith could dwell Amid that dreary glare , in this world 's citadel ?
Parsing [sent. 3588 len. 64]: But Love 's a flower that will not die For lack of leafy screen , And Christian Hope can cheer the eye That ne'er saw vernal green : Then be ye sure that Love can bless Even in this crowded loneliness , Where ever-moving myriads seem to say , Go -- thou art nought to us , nor we to thee -- away !
Parsing [sent. 3589 len. 53]: There are in this loud stunning tide Of human care and crime , With whom the melodies abide Of the everlasting chime ; Who carry music in their heart Through dusky lane and wrangling mart , Plying their daily task with busier feet , Because their secret souls a holy strain repeat .
Parsing [sent. 3590 len. 20]: There are here some indications of that strong reaction of the present century towards ancient forms of church life .
Parsing [sent. 3591 len. 19]: This reaction seems to me a further consequence of that admiration of power of which I have spoken .
Parsing [sent. 3592 len. 59]: For , finding the progress of discovery in the laws of nature constantly bring an assurance most satisfactory to the intellect , men began to demand a similar assurance in other matters ; and whatever department of human thought could not be subjected to experiment or did not admit of logical proof began to be regarded with suspicion .
Parsing [sent. 3593 len. 70]: The highest realms of human thought -- where indeed only grand conviction , and that the result not of research , but of obedience to the voice within , can be had -- came to be by such regarded as regions where , no scientific assurance being procurable , it was only to his loss that a man should go wandering : the whole affair was unworthy of him .
Parsing [sent. 3594 len. 64]: And if there be no guide of humanity but the intellect , and nothing worthy of its regard but what that intellect can isolate and describe in the forms peculiar to its operations , -- that is , if a man has relations to nothing beyond his definition , is not a creature of the immeasurable , -- then these men are right .
Parsing [sent. 3595 len. 89]: But there have appeared along with them other thinkers who could not thus be satisfied -- men who had in their souls a hunger which the neatest laws of nature could not content , who could not live on chemistry , or mathematics , or even on geology , without the primal law of _ their _ many dim-dawning wonders -- that is , the Being , if such there might be , who thought their laws first and then embodied them in a world of aeonian growth .
Parsing [sent. 3596 len. 31]: These indeed seek law likewise , but a perfect law -- a law they can believe perfect beyond the comprehension of powers of whose imperfection they are too painfully conscious .
Parsing [sent. 3597 len. 34]: They feel in their highest moments a helplessness that drives them to search after some Power with a heart deeper than his power , who cares for the troubled creatures he has made .
Parsing [sent. 3598 len. 58]: But still under the influence of that faithless hunger for intellectual certainty , they look about and divide into two parties : both would gladly receive the reported revelation in Jesus , the one if they could have evidence enough from without , the other if they could only get rid of the difficulties it raises within .
Parsing [sent. 3599 len. 44]: I am aware that I distinguish in the mass , and that both sides would be found more or less influenced by the same difficulties -- but _ more _ and _ less _ , and therefore thus classified by the driving predominance .
Parsing [sent. 3600 len. 50]: Those of the one party , then , finding no proof to be had but that in testimony , and anxious to have all they can -- delighting too in a certain holy wilfulness of intellectual self-immolation , accept the testimony in the mass , and become Roman Catholics .
Parsing [sent. 3601 len. 12]: Nor is it difficult to see how they then find rest .
Parsing [sent. 3602 len. 58]: It is not the dogma , but the contact with Christ the truth , with Christ the man , which the dogma , in pacifying the troubles of the intellect -- if only by a soporific , has aided them in reaching , that gives them peace : it is the truth itself that makes them free .
Parsing [sent. 3603 len. 40]: The worshippers of science will themselves allow , that when they can not gain observations enough to satisfy them upon any point in which a law of nature is involved , they must , if possible , institute experiments .
Parsing [sent. 3604 len. 23]: I say therefore to those whose observation has not satisfied them concerning the phenomenon Christianity , -- `` Where is your experiment ?
Parsing [sent. 3605 len. 16]: Why do you not thus try the utterance claiming to be the law of life ?
Parsing [sent. 3606 len. 10]: Call it a hypothesis , and experiment upon it .
Parsing [sent. 3607 len. 82]: Carry into practice , well justified of your conscience , the words which the Man spoke , for therein he says himself lies the possibility of your acceptance of his mission ; and if , after reasonable time thus spent , you are not yet convinced enough to give testimony -- I will not annoy you by saying _ to facts _ , but -- to conviction , I think neither will you be ready to abandon the continuous experiment . ''
Parsing [sent. 3608 len. 34]: These Roman Catholics have thus met with Jesus , come into personal contact with him : by the doing of what he tells us , and by nothing else , are they blessed .
Parsing [sent. 3609 len. 23]: What if their theories show to me like a burning of the temple and a looking for the god in the ashes ?
Parsing [sent. 3610 len. 8]: They know in whom they have believed .
Parsing [sent. 3611 len. 39]: And if some of us think we have a more excellent way , we shall be blessed indeed if the result be no less excellent than in such men as Faber , Newman , and Aubrey de Vere .
Parsing [sent. 3612 len. 36]: No man needs be afraid that to speak the truth concerning such will hasten the dominance of alien and oppressive powers ; the truth is free , and to be just is to be strong .
Parsing [sent. 3613 len. 55]: Should the time come again when Liberty is in danger , those who have defended the truth even in her adversaries , if such there be , will be found the readiest to draw the sword for her , and , hating not , yet smite for the liberty to do even them justice .
Parsing [sent. 3614 len. 31]: To give the justice we claim for ourselves is , if there be a Christ , the law of Christ , to obey which is eternally better than truest theory .
Parsing [sent. 3615 len. 13]: I should like to give many of the hymns of Dr. Faber .
Parsing [sent. 3616 len. 22]: Some of them are grand , others very lovely , and some , of course , to my mind considerably repulsive .
Parsing [sent. 3617 len. 33]: He seems to me to go wrong nowhere in originating -- he produces nothing unworthy except when he reproduces what he never could have entertained but for the pressure of acknowledged authority .
Parsing [sent. 3618 len. 19]: Even such things , however , he has enclosed in pearls , as the oyster its incommoding sand-grains .
Parsing [sent. 3619 len. 56]: His hymn on _ The Greatness of God _ is profound ; that on _ The Will of God _ is very wise ; that to _ The God of my Childhood _ is full of quite womanly tenderness : all are most simple in speech , reminding us in this respect of John Mason .
Parsing [sent. 3620 len. 77]: In him , no doubt , as in all of his class , we find traces of that sentimentalism in the use of epithets -- small words , as distinguished from homely , applied to great things -- of which I have spoken more than once ; but criticism is not to be indulged in the reception of great gifts -- of such a gift as this , for instance : -- THE ETERNITY OF GOD .
Parsing [sent. 3621 len. 3]: O Lord !
Parsing [sent. 3622 len. 42]: my heart is sick , Sick of this everlasting change ; And life runs tediously quick Through its unresting race and varied range : Change finds no likeness to itself in Thee , And wakes no echo in Thy mute eternity .
Parsing [sent. 3623 len. 3]: Dear Lord !
Parsing [sent. 3624 len. 47]: my heart is sick Of this perpetual lapsing time , So slow in grief , in joy so quick , Yet ever casting shadows so sublime : Time of all creatures is least like to Thee , And yet it is our share of Thine eternity .
Parsing [sent. 3625 len. 54]: Oh change and time are storms For lives so thin and frail as ours ; For change the work of grace deforms With love that soils , and help that overpowers ; And time is strong , and , like some chafing sea , It seems to fret the shores of Thine eternity .
Parsing [sent. 3626 len. 8]: Weak , weak , for ever weak !
Parsing [sent. 3627 len. 48]: We can not hold what we possess ; Youth can not find , age will not seek , -- Oh weakness is the heart 's worst weariness : But weakest hearts can lift their thoughts to Thee ; It makes us strong to think of Thine eternity .
Parsing [sent. 3628 len. 8]: Thou hadst no youth , great God !
Parsing [sent. 3629 len. 34]: An Unbeginning End Thou art ; Thy glory in itself abode , And still abides in its own tranquil heart : No age can heap its outward years on Thee : Dear God !
Parsing [sent. 3630 len. 7]: Thou art Thyself Thine own eternity !
Parsing [sent. 3631 len. 47]: Without an end or bound Thy life lies all outspread in light ; Our lives feel Thy life all around , Making our weakness strong , our darkness bright ; Yet is it neither wilderness nor sea , But the calm gladness of a full eternity .
Parsing [sent. 3632 len. 12]: Oh Thou art very great To set Thyself so far above !
Parsing [sent. 3633 len. 33]: But we partake of Thine estate , Established in Thy strength and in Thy love : That love hath made eternal room for me In the sweet vastness of its own eternity .
Parsing [sent. 3634 len. 11]: Oh Thou art very meek To overshade Thy creatures thus !
Parsing [sent. 3635 len. 22]: Thy grandeur is the shade we seek ; To be eternal is Thy use to us : Ah , Blessed God !
Parsing [sent. 3636 len. 16]: what joy it is to me To lose all thought of self in Thine eternity .
Parsing [sent. 3637 len. 4]: Self-wearied , Lord !
Parsing [sent. 3638 len. 49]: I come ; For I have lived my life too fast : Now that years bring me nearer home Grace must be slowly used to make it last ; When my heart beats too quick I think of Thee , And of the leisure of Thy long eternity .
Parsing [sent. 3639 len. 7]: Farewell , vain joys of earth !
Parsing [sent. 3640 len. 9]: Farewell , all love that it not His !
Parsing [sent. 3641 len. 3]: Dear God !
Parsing [sent. 3642 len. 13]: be Thou my only mirth , Thy majesty my single timid bliss !
Parsing [sent. 3643 len. 18]: Oh in the bosom of eternity Thou dost not weary of Thyself , nor we of Thee !
Parsing [sent. 3644 len. 15]: How easily his words flow , even when he is saying the deepest things !
Parsing [sent. 3645 len. 23]: The poem is full of the elements of the finest mystical metaphysics , and yet there is no effort in their expression .
Parsing [sent. 3646 len. 24]: The tendency to find God beyond , rather than in our daily human conditions , is discernible ; but only as a tendency .
Parsing [sent. 3647 len. 20]: What a pity that the sects are so slow to become acquainted with the grand best in each other !
Parsing [sent. 3648 len. 20]: I do not find in Dr. Newman either a depth or a precision equal to that of Dr. Faber .
Parsing [sent. 3649 len. 11]: His earlier poems indicate a less healthy condition of mind .
Parsing [sent. 3650 len. 23]: His _ Dream of Gerontius _ is , however , a finer , as more ambitious poem than any of Faber 's .
Parsing [sent. 3651 len. 16]: In my judgment there are weak passages in it , with others of real grandeur .
Parsing [sent. 3652 len. 76]: But I am perfectly aware of the difficulty , almost impossibility , of doing justice to men from some of whose forms of thought I am greatly repelled , who creep from the sunshine into every ruined archway , attracted by the brilliance with which the light from its loophole glows in its caverned gloom , and the hope of discovering within it the first steps of a stair winding up into the blue heaven .
Parsing [sent. 3653 len. 43]: I apologize for the unavoidable rudeness of a critic who would fain be honest if he might ; and I humbly thank all such as Dr. Newman , whose verses , revealing their saintship , make us long to be holier men .
Parsing [sent. 3654 len. 17]: Of his , as of Faber 's , I have room for no more than one .
Parsing [sent. 3655 len. 6]: It was written off Sardinia .
Parsing [sent. 3656 len. 2]: DESOLATION .
Parsing [sent. 3657 len. 32]: O say not thou art left of God , Because His tokens in the sky Thou canst not read : this earth He trod To teach thee He was ever nigh .
Parsing [sent. 3658 len. 28]: He sees , beneath the fig-tree green , Nathaniel con His sacred lore ; Shouldst thou thy chamber seek , unseen He enters through the unopened door .
Parsing [sent. 3659 len. 31]: And when thou liest , by slumber bound , Outwearied in the Christian fight , In glory , girt with saints around , He stands above thee through the night .
Parsing [sent. 3660 len. 37]: When friends to Emmaus bend their course , He joins , although He holds their eyes : Or , shouldst thou feel some fever 's force , He takes thy hand , He bids thee rise .
Parsing [sent. 3661 len. 36]: Or on a voyage , when calms prevail , And prison thee upon the sea , He walks the waves , He wings the sail , The shore is gained , and thou art free .
Parsing [sent. 3662 len. 17]: Sir Aubrey de Vere is a poet profound in feeling , and gracefully tender in utterance .
Parsing [sent. 3663 len. 9]: I give one short poem and one sonnet .
Parsing [sent. 3664 len. 2]: REALITY .
Parsing [sent. 3665 len. 17]: Love thy God , and love Him only : And thy breast will ne'er be lonely .
Parsing [sent. 3666 len. 15]: In that one great Spirit meet All things mighty , grave , and sweet .
Parsing [sent. 3667 len. 27]: Vainly strives the soul to mingle With a being of our kind : Vainly hearts with hearts are twined : For the deepest still is single .
Parsing [sent. 3668 len. 10]: An impalpable resistance Holds like natures still at distance .
Parsing [sent. 3669 len. 2]: Mortal !
Parsing [sent. 3670 len. 5]: love that Holy One !
Parsing [sent. 3671 len. 6]: Or dwell for aye alone .
Parsing [sent. 3672 len. 57]: I respond most heartily to the last two lines ; but I venture to add , with regard to the preceding six , `` Love that holy One , and the impalpable resistance will vanish ; for when thou seest him enter to sup with thy neighbour , thou wilt love that neighbour as thyself . ''
Parsing [sent. 3673 len. 2]: SONNET .
Parsing [sent. 3674 len. 31]: Ye praise the humble : of the meek ye say , `` Happy they live among their lowly bowers ; `` The mountains , and the mountain-storms are ours . ''
Parsing [sent. 3675 len. 44]: Thus , self-deceivers , filled with pride alway , Reluctant homage to the good ye pay , Mingled with scorn like poison sucked from flowers -- Revere the humble ; godlike are their powers : No mendicants for praise of men are they .
Parsing [sent. 3676 len. 57]: The child who prays in faith `` Thy will be done '' Is blended with that Will Supreme which moves A wilderness of worlds by Thought untrod ; He shares the starry sceptre , and the throne : The man who as himself his neighbour loves Looks down on all things with the eyes of God !
Parsing [sent. 3677 len. 49]: Is it a fancy that , in the midst of all this devotion and lovely thought , I hear the mingled mournful tone of such as have cut off a right hand and plucked out a right eye , which had _ not _ caused them to offend ?
Parsing [sent. 3678 len. 62]: This is tenfold better than to have spared offending members ; but the true Christian ambition is to fill the divine scheme of humanity -- abridging nothing , ignoring nothing , denying nothing , calling nothing unclean , but burning everything a thank-offering in the flame of life upon the altar of absolute devotion to the Father and Saviour of men .
Parsing [sent. 3679 len. 23]: We must not throw away half his gifts , that we may carry the other half in both hands to his altar .
Parsing [sent. 3680 len. 9]: But sacred fervour is confined to no sect .
Parsing [sent. 3681 len. 21]: Here it is of the profoundest , and uttered with a homely tenderness equal to that of the earliest writers .
Parsing [sent. 3682 len. 12]: Mrs. Browning , the princess of poets , was no partisan .
Parsing [sent. 3683 len. 28]: If my work were mainly critical , I should feel bound to remark upon her false theory of English rhyme , and her use of strange words .
Parsing [sent. 3684 len. 26]: That she is careless too in her general utterance I can not deny ; but in idea she is noble , and in phrase magnificent .
Parsing [sent. 3685 len. 22]: Some of her sonnets are worthy of being ranged with the best in our language -- those of Milton and Wordsworth .
Parsing [sent. 3686 len. 2]: BEREAVEMENT .
Parsing [sent. 3687 len. 60]: When some Beloveds , ` neath whose eyelids lay The sweet lights of my childhood , one by one Did leave me dark before the natural sun , And I astonied fell , and could not pray , A thought within me to myself did say , `` Is God less God that _ thou _ art left undone ?
Parsing [sent. 3688 len. 7]: Rise , worship , bless Him !
Parsing [sent. 3689 len. 11]: in this sackcloth spun , As in that purple ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3690 len. 7]: -- But I answer , Nay !
Parsing [sent. 3691 len. 23]: What child his filial heart in words can loose , If he behold his tender father raise The hand that chastens sorely ?
Parsing [sent. 3692 len. 12]: Can he choose But sob in silence with an upward gaze ?
Parsing [sent. 3693 len. 21]: And _ my _ great Father , thinking fit to bruise , Discerns in speechless tears both prayer and praise .
Parsing [sent. 3694 len. 2]: COMFORT .
Parsing [sent. 3695 len. 41]: Speak low to me , my Saviour , low and sweet , From out the hallelujahs sweet and low , Lest I should fear and fall , and miss thee so , Who art not missed by any that entreat .
Parsing [sent. 3696 len. 51]: Speak to me as to Mary at thy feet -- And if no precious gums my hands bestow , Let my tears drop like amber , while I go In reach of thy divinest voice complete In humanest affection -- thus , in sooth To lose the sense of losing !
Parsing [sent. 3697 len. 40]: As a child , Whose song-bird seeks the wood for evermore , Is sung to in its stead by mother 's mouth ; Till sinking on her breast , love-reconciled , He sleeps the faster that he wept before .
Parsing [sent. 3698 len. 82]: Gladly would I next give myself to the exposition of several of the poems of her husband , Robert Browning , especially the _ Christmas Eve _ and _ Easter Day _ ; in the first of which he sets forth in marvellous rhymes the necessity both for widest sympathy with the varied forms of Christianity , and for individual choice in regard to communion ; in the latter , what it is to choose the world and lose the life .
Parsing [sent. 3699 len. 18]: But this would take many pages , and would be inconsistent with the plan of my book .
Parsing [sent. 3700 len. 47]: When I have given two precious stanzas , most wise as well as most lyrical and lovely , from the poems of our honoured Charles Kingsley , I shall turn to the other of the classes into which the devout thinkers of the day have divided .
Parsing [sent. 3701 len. 3]: A FAREWELL .
Parsing [sent. 3702 len. 39]: My fairest child , I have no song to give you ; No lark could pipe to skies so dull and grey ; Yet , ere we part , one lesson I can leave you For every day .
Parsing [sent. 3703 len. 42]: Be good , sweet maid , and let who will be clever ; Do noble things , not dream them , all day long ; And so make life , death , and that vast for-ever One grand , sweet song .
Parsing [sent. 3704 len. 63]: Surely these last , who have not accepted tradition in the mass , who believe that we must , as our Lord demanded of the Jews , of our own selves judge what is right , because therein his spirit works with our spirit , -- worship the Truth not less devotedly than they who rejoice in holy tyranny over their intellects .
Parsing [sent. 3705 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXIII .
Parsing [sent. 3706 len. 4]: THE QUESTIONING FERVOUR .
Parsing [sent. 3707 len. 73]: And now I turn to the other class -- that which , while the former has fled to tradition for refuge from doubt , sets its face towards the spiritual east , and in prayer and sorrow and hope looks for a dawn -- the noble band of reverent doubters -- as unlike those of the last century who scoffed , as those of the present who pass on the other side .
Parsing [sent. 3708 len. 30]: They too would know ; but they know enough already to know further , that it is from the hills and not from the mines their aid must come .
Parsing [sent. 3709 len. 51]: They know that a perfect intellectual proof would leave them doubting all the same ; that their high questions can not be answered to the intellect alone , for their whole nature is the questioner ; that the answers can only come as questioners and their questions grow towards them .
Parsing [sent. 3710 len. 44]: Hence , growing hope , blossoming ever and anon into the white flower of confidence , is their answer as yet ; their hope -- the Beatific Vision -- the _ happy-making sight _ , as Milton renders the word of the mystics .
Parsing [sent. 3711 len. 72]: It is strange how gentle a certain large class of the priesthood will be with those who , believing there is a God , find it hard to trust him , and how fierce with those who , unable , from the lack of harmony around and in them , to say they are sure there is a God , would yet , could they find him , trust him indeed .
Parsing [sent. 3712 len. 26]: `` Ah , but , '' answer such of the clergy and their followers , `` you want a God of your own making . ''
Parsing [sent. 3713 len. 37]: `` Certainly , '' the doubters reply , `` we do not want a God of your making : that would be to turn the universe into a hell , and you into its torturing demons .
Parsing [sent. 3714 len. 95]: We want a God like that man whose name is so often on your lips , but whose spirit you understand so little -- so like him that he shall be the bread of life to _ all _ our hunger -- not that hunger only already satisfied in you , who take the limit of your present consciousness for that of the race , and say , ` This is all the world needs : ' we know the bitterness of our own hearts , and your incapacity for intermeddling with its joy .
Parsing [sent. 3715 len. 42]: We have another mountain-range , from whence Bursteth a sun unutterably bright ; nor for us only , but for you also , who will not have the truth except it come to you in a system authorized of man . ''
