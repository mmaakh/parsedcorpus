Parsing [sent. 37 len. 8]: CHAPTER I. MRS. DAY BEGINS THE STORY .
Parsing [sent. 38 len. 25]: I am old , else , I think , I should not have the courage to tell the story I am going to tell .
Parsing [sent. 39 len. 24]: All those concerned in it about whose feelings I am careful , are gone where , thank God , there are no secrets !
Parsing [sent. 40 len. 15]: If they know what I am doing , I know they do not mind .
Parsing [sent. 41 len. 45]: If they were alive to read as I record , they might perhaps now and again look a little paler and wish the leaf turned , but to see the things set down would not make them unhappy : they do not love secrecy .
Parsing [sent. 42 len. 23]: Half the misery in the world comes from trying to look , instead of trying to be , what one is not .
Parsing [sent. 43 len. 19]: I would that not God only but all good men and women might see me through and through .
Parsing [sent. 44 len. 30]: They would not be pleased with everything they saw , but then neither am I , and I would have no coals of fire in my soul 's pockets !
Parsing [sent. 45 len. 21]: But my very nature would shudder at the thought of letting one person that loved a secret see into it .
Parsing [sent. 46 len. 28]: Such a one never sees things as they are -- would not indeed see what was there , but something shaped and coloured after his own likeness .
Parsing [sent. 47 len. 20]: No one who loves and chooses a secret can be of the pure in heart that shall see God .
Parsing [sent. 48 len. 10]: Yet how shall I tell even who I am ?
Parsing [sent. 49 len. 13]: Which of us is other than a secret to all but God !
Parsing [sent. 50 len. 16]: Which of us can tell , with poorest approximation , what he or she is !
Parsing [sent. 51 len. 74]: Not to touch the mystery of life -- that one who is not myself has made me able to say _ I _ , how little can any of us tell about even those ancestors whose names we know , while yet the nature , and still more the character , of hundreds of them , have shared in determining what _ I _ means every time one of us utters the word !
Parsing [sent. 52 len. 30]: For myself , I remember neither father nor mother , nor one of their fathers or mothers : how little then can I say as to what I am !
Parsing [sent. 53 len. 23]: But I will tell as much as most of my readers , if ever I have any , will care to know .
Parsing [sent. 54 len. 12]: I come of a long yeoman-line of the name of Whichcote .
Parsing [sent. 55 len. 22]: In Scotland the Whichcotes would have been called _ lairds _ ; in England they were not called _ squires _ .
Parsing [sent. 56 len. 61]: Repeatedly had younger sons of it risen to rank and honour , and in several generations would his property have entitled the head of the family to rank as a squire , but at the time when I began to be aware of existence , the family possessions had dwindled to one large farm , on which I found myself .
Parsing [sent. 57 len. 39]: Naturally , while some of the family had risen , others had sunk in the social scale ; and of the latter was Miss Martha Moon , far more to my life than can appear in my story .
Parsing [sent. 58 len. 19]: I should imagine there are few families in England covering a larger range of social difference than ours .
Parsing [sent. 59 len. 24]: But I begin to think the chief difficulty in writing a book must be to keep out what does not belong to it .
Parsing [sent. 60 len. 34]: I may mention , however , my conviction , that I owe many special delights to the gradual development of my race in certain special relations to the natural ways of the world .
Parsing [sent. 61 len. 51]: That I was myself brought up in such relations , appears not enough to account for the intensity of my pleasure in things belonging to simplest life -- in everything of the open air , in animals of all kinds , in the economy of field and meadow and moor .
Parsing [sent. 62 len. 79]: I can no more understand my delight in the sweet breath of a cow , than I can explain the process by which , that day in the garden -- but I must not forestall , and will say rather -- than I can account for the tears which , now I am an old woman , fill my eyes just as they used when I was a child , at sight of the year 's first primrose .
Parsing [sent. 63 len. 17]: A harebell , much as I have always loved harebells , never moved me that way !
Parsing [sent. 64 len. 39]: Some will say the cause , whatever it be , lies in my nature , not in my ancestry ; that , anyhow , it must have come first to some one -- and why not to me ?
Parsing [sent. 65 len. 19]: I answer , Everything lies in everyone of us , but has to be brought to the surface .
Parsing [sent. 66 len. 45]: It grows a little in one , more in that one 's child , more in that child 's child , and so on and on -- with curious breaks as of a river which every now and then takes to an underground course .
Parsing [sent. 67 len. 56]: One thing I am sure of -- that , however any good thing came , I did not make it ; I can only be glad and thankful that in me it came to the surface , to tell me how beautiful must he be who thought of it , and made it in me .
Parsing [sent. 68 len. 46]: Then surely one is nearer , if not to God himself , yet to the things God loves , in the country than amid ugly houses -- things that could not have been invented by God , though he made the man that made them .
Parsing [sent. 69 len. 51]: It is not the fashionable only that love the town and not the country ; the men and women who live in dirt and squalor -- their counterparts in this and worse things far more than they think -- are afraid of loneliness , and hate God 's lovely dark .
Parsing [sent. 70 len. 3]: CHAPTER II .
Parsing [sent. 71 len. 4]: MISS MARTHA MOON .
Parsing [sent. 72 len. 13]: Let me look back and see what first things I first remember !
Parsing [sent. 73 len. 14]: All about my uncle first ; but I keep him to the last .
Parsing [sent. 74 len. 22]: Next , all about Rover , the dog -- though for roving , I hardly remember him away from my side !
Parsing [sent. 75 len. 47]: Alas , he did not live to come into the story , but I must mention him here , for I shall not write another book , and , in the briefest summary of my childhood , to make no allusion to him would be disloyalty .
Parsing [sent. 76 len. 30]: I almost believe that at one period , had I been set to say who I was , I should have included Rover as an essential part of myself .
Parsing [sent. 77 len. 18]: His tail was my tail ; his legs were my legs ; his tongue was my tongue !
Parsing [sent. 78 len. 22]: -- so much more did I , as we gambolled together , seem conscious of his joy than of my own !
Parsing [sent. 79 len. 14]: Surely , among other and greater mercies , I shall find him again !
Parsing [sent. 80 len. 28]: The next person I see busy about the place , now here now there in the house , and seldom outside it , is Miss Martha Moon .
Parsing [sent. 81 len. 28]: The house is large , built at a time when the family was one of consequence , and there was always much to be done in it .
Parsing [sent. 82 len. 23]: The largest room in it is now called the kitchen , but was doubtless called the hall when first it was built .
Parsing [sent. 83 len. 8]: This was Miss Martha Moon 's headquarters .
Parsing [sent. 84 len. 34]: She was my uncle 's second cousin , and as he always called her Martha , so did I , without rebuke : every one else about the place called her Miss Martha .
Parsing [sent. 85 len. 24]: Of much greater worth and much more genuine refinement than tens of thousands the world calls ladies , she never claimed the distinction .
Parsing [sent. 86 len. 7]: Indeed she strongly objected to it .
Parsing [sent. 87 len. 27]: If you had said or implied she was a lady , she would have shrunk as from a covert reflection on the quality of her work .
Parsing [sent. 88 len. 19]: Had she known certain of such as nowadays call themselves lady-helps , I could have understood her objection .
Parsing [sent. 89 len. 25]: I think , however , it came from a stern adherence to the factness -- if I may coin the word -- of things .
Parsing [sent. 90 len. 8]: She never called a lie a fib .
Parsing [sent. 91 len. 16]: When she was angry , she always held her tongue ; she feared being unfair .
Parsing [sent. 92 len. 9]: She had indeed a rare power of silence .
Parsing [sent. 93 len. 57]: To this day I do not _ know _ , but am nevertheless sure that , by an instinct of understanding , she saw into my uncle 's trouble , and descried , more or less plainly , the secret of it , while yet she never even alluded to the existence of such a trouble .
Parsing [sent. 94 len. 13]: She had a regard for woman 's dignity as profound as silent .
Parsing [sent. 95 len. 27]: She was not of those that prate or rave about their rights , forget their duties , and care only for what they count their victories .
Parsing [sent. 96 len. 7]: She declared herself dead against marriage .
Parsing [sent. 97 len. 28]: One day , while yet hardly more than a child , I said to her thoughtfully , `` I wonder why you hate gentlemen , Martha ! ''
Parsing [sent. 98 len. 4]: `` Hate 'em !
Parsing [sent. 99 len. 14]: What on earth makes you say such a wicked thing , Orbie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 100 len. 3]: she answered .
Parsing [sent. 101 len. 8]: `` Hate 'em , the poor dears !
Parsing [sent. 102 len. 4]: I love 'em !
Parsing [sent. 103 len. 16]: What did you ever see to make you think I hated your uncle now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 104 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 105 len. 3]: of course !
Parsing [sent. 106 len. 3]: uncle ! ''
Parsing [sent. 107 len. 13]: I returned ; for my uncle was all the world to me .
Parsing [sent. 108 len. 7]: `` Nobody could hate uncle ! ''
Parsing [sent. 109 len. 14]: `` She 'd be a bad woman , anyhow , that did ! ''
Parsing [sent. 110 len. 3]: rejoined Martha .
Parsing [sent. 111 len. 18]: `` But did anybody ever hate the person that could n't do without her , Orbie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 112 len. 27]: My name -- suggested by my uncle because my mother died at my birth -- was a curious one ; I believe he made it himself .
Parsing [sent. 113 len. 14]: _ Belorba _ it was , and it means _ Fair Orphan _ .
Parsing [sent. 114 len. 12]: `` I do n't know , Martha , '' I replied .
Parsing [sent. 115 len. 9]: `` Well , you watch and see ! ''
Parsing [sent. 116 len. 3]: she returned .
Parsing [sent. 117 len. 23]: `` Do you think I would stay here and work from morning to night if I had n't some reason for it ?
Parsing [sent. 118 len. 8]: -- Oh , I like work ! ''
Parsing [sent. 119 len. 11]: she went on ; `` I do n't deny that .
Parsing [sent. 120 len. 10]: I should be miserable if I did n't work .
Parsing [sent. 121 len. 11]: But I 'm not bound to this sort of work .
Parsing [sent. 122 len. 15]: I have money of my own , and I 'm no beggar for house-room .
Parsing [sent. 123 len. 10]: But rather than leave your uncle , poor man !
Parsing [sent. 124 len. 12]: I would do the work of a ploughman for him . ''
Parsing [sent. 125 len. 12]: `` Then why do n't you marry him , Martha ? ''
Parsing [sent. 126 len. 7]: I said , with innocent impertinence .
Parsing [sent. 127 len. 4]: `` Marry him !
Parsing [sent. 128 len. 13]: I would n't marry him for ten thousand pounds , child ! ''
Parsing [sent. 129 len. 11]: `` Why not , if you love him so much ?
Parsing [sent. 130 len. 9]: I 'm sure he would n't mind ! ''
Parsing [sent. 131 len. 5]: `` Marry him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 132 len. 36]: repeated Miss Martha , and stood looking at me as if here at last was a creature she could _ not _ understand ; `` marry the poor dear man , and make him miserable !
Parsing [sent. 133 len. 9]: I could love any man better than that !
Parsing [sent. 134 len. 17]: Just you open your eyes , my dear , and see what goes on about you .
Parsing [sent. 135 len. 12]: Do you see so many men made happy by their wives ?
Parsing [sent. 136 len. 15]: I do n't say it 's all the wives ' fault , poor things !
Parsing [sent. 137 len. 21]: But the fact 's the same : there 's the poor husbands all the time trying hard to bear it !
Parsing [sent. 138 len. 28]: What with the babies , and the headaches , and the rest of it , that 's what it comes to -- the husbands are not happy !
Parsing [sent. 139 len. 4]: No , no !
Parsing [sent. 140 len. 13]: A woman can do better for a man than marry him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 141 len. 16]: `` But may n't it be the husband 's fault -- sometimes , Martha ? ''
Parsing [sent. 142 len. 12]: `` It may ; but what better is it for that ?
Parsing [sent. 143 len. 20]: What better is the wife for knowing it , or how much happier the husband for not knowing it ?
Parsing [sent. 144 len. 25]: As soon as you come to weighing who 's in fault , and counting how much , it 's all up with the marriage .
Parsing [sent. 145 len. 12]: There 's no more comfort in life for either of them !
Parsing [sent. 146 len. 11]: Women are sent into the world to make men happy .
Parsing [sent. 147 len. 16]: I was sent to your uncle , and I 'm trying to do my duty .
Parsing [sent. 148 len. 18]: It 's nothing to me what other women think ; I 'm here to serve your uncle .
Parsing [sent. 149 len. 30]: What comes of me , I do n't care , so long as I do my work , and do n't keep him waiting that made me for it .
Parsing [sent. 150 len. 13]: You may think it a small thing to make a man happy !
Parsing [sent. 151 len. 4]: I do n't .
Parsing [sent. 152 len. 16]: God thought him worth making , and he would n't be if he was miserable .
Parsing [sent. 153 len. 10]: I 've seen one woman make ten men unhappy !
Parsing [sent. 154 len. 7]: I know my calling , Orbie .
Parsing [sent. 155 len. 13]: Nothing would make me marry one of them , poor things ! ''
Parsing [sent. 156 len. 13]: `` But if they all said as you do , Martha ? ''
Parsing [sent. 157 len. 21]: `` No doubt the world would come to an end , but it would go out singing , not crying .
Parsing [sent. 158 len. 8]: I do n't see that would matter .
Parsing [sent. 159 len. 24]: There would be enough to make each other happy in heaven , and the Lord could make more as they were wanted . ''
Parsing [sent. 160 len. 15]: `` Uncle says it takes God a long time to make a man ! ''
Parsing [sent. 161 len. 5]: I ventured to remark .
Parsing [sent. 162 len. 8]: Miss Martha was silent for a moment .
Parsing [sent. 163 len. 37]: She did not see how my remark bore on the matter in hand , but she had such respect for anything my uncle said , that when she did not grasp it she held her peace .
Parsing [sent. 164 len. 13]: `` Anyhow there 's no fear of it for the present ! ''
Parsing [sent. 165 len. 3]: she answered .
Parsing [sent. 166 len. 11]: `` You heard the screed of banns last Sunday ! ''
Parsing [sent. 167 len. 24]: I thought you would have a better idea of Miss Martha Moon from hearing her talk , than from any talk about her .
Parsing [sent. 168 len. 11]: To hear one talk is better than to see one .
Parsing [sent. 169 len. 14]: But I would not have you think she often spoke at such length .
Parsing [sent. 170 len. 19]: She was in truth a woman of few words , never troubled or troubling with any verbal catarrh .
Parsing [sent. 171 len. 13]: Especially silent she was when any one she loved was in distress .
Parsing [sent. 172 len. 42]: I have seen her stand moveless for moments , with a look that was the incarnation of essential motherhood -- as if her eyes were swallowing up sorrow ; as if her soul was ready to be the sacrifice for sin .
Parsing [sent. 173 len. 32]: Then she would turn away with a droop of the eye-lids that seemed to say she saw what it was , but saw also how little she could do for it .
Parsing [sent. 174 len. 12]: Oh the depth of the love-trouble in those eyes of hers !
Parsing [sent. 175 len. 24]: Martha never set herself to teach me anything , but I could not know Martha without learning something of the genuine human heart .
Parsing [sent. 176 len. 8]: I gathered from her by unconscious assimilation .
Parsing [sent. 177 len. 17]: Possibly , a spiritual action analogous to exosmose and endosmose , takes place between certain souls .
Parsing [sent. 178 len. 3]: CHAPTER III .
Parsing [sent. 179 len. 3]: MY UNCLE .
Parsing [sent. 180 len. 11]: Now I must tell you what my uncle was like .
Parsing [sent. 181 len. 19]: The first thing that struck you about him would have been , how tall and thin he was .
Parsing [sent. 182 len. 20]: The next thing would have been , how he stooped ; and the next , how sad he looked .
Parsing [sent. 183 len. 15]: It scarcely seemed that Martha Moon had been able to do much for him .
Parsing [sent. 184 len. 18]: Yet doubtless she had done , and was doing , more than either he or she knew .
Parsing [sent. 185 len. 48]: He had rather a small head on the top of his long body ; and when he stood straight up , which was not very often , it seemed so far away , that some one said he took him for Zacchaeus looking down from the sycomore .
Parsing [sent. 186 len. 20]: _ I _ never thought of analyzing his appearance , never thought of comparing him with any one else .
Parsing [sent. 187 len. 20]: To me he was the best and most beautiful of men -- the first man in all the world .
Parsing [sent. 188 len. 24]: Nor did I change my mind about him ever -- I only came to want another to think of him as I did .
Parsing [sent. 189 len. 12]: His features were in fine proportion , though perhaps too delicate .
Parsing [sent. 190 len. 12]: Perhaps they were a little too small to be properly beautiful .
Parsing [sent. 191 len. 19]: When first I saw a likeness of the poet Shelley , I called out `` My uncle ! ''
Parsing [sent. 192 len. 7]: and immediately began to see differences .
Parsing [sent. 193 len. 22]: He wore a small but long moustache , brushed away from his mouth ; and over it his eyes looked large .
Parsing [sent. 194 len. 11]: They were of a clear gray , and very gentle .
Parsing [sent. 195 len. 20]: I know from the testimony of others , that I was right in imagining him a really learned man .
Parsing [sent. 196 len. 18]: That small head of his contained more and better than many a larger head of greater note .
Parsing [sent. 197 len. 29]: He was constantly reading -- that is , when not thinking , or giving me the lessons which make me now thank him for half my conscious soul .
Parsing [sent. 198 len. 26]: Reading or writing or thinking , he made me always welcome to share his room with him ; but he seldom took me out walking .
Parsing [sent. 199 len. 23]: He was by no means regular in his habits -- regarded neither times nor seasons -- went and came like a bird .
Parsing [sent. 200 len. 18]: His hour for going out was unknown to himself , was seldom two days together the same .
Parsing [sent. 201 len. 36]: He would rise up suddenly , even in the middle of a lesson -- he always called it `` a lesson together '' -- and without a word walk from the room and the house .
Parsing [sent. 202 len. 18]: I had soon observed that in gloomy weather he went out often , in the sunshine seldom .
Parsing [sent. 203 len. 31]: The house had a large garden , of a very old-fashioned sort , such a place for the charm of both glory and gloom as I have never seen elsewhere .
Parsing [sent. 204 len. 32]: I have had other eyes opened within me to deeper beauties than I saw in that garden then ; my remembrance of it is none the less of an enchanted ground .
Parsing [sent. 205 len. 8]: But my uncle never walked in it .
Parsing [sent. 206 len. 25]: When he walked , it was always out on the moor he went , and what time he would return no one ever knew .
Parsing [sent. 207 len. 30]: His meals were uninteresting to him -- no concern to any one but Martha , who never uttered a word of impatience , and seldom a word of anxiety .
Parsing [sent. 208 len. 23]: At whatever hour of the day he went , it was almost always night when he came home , often late night .
Parsing [sent. 209 len. 13]: In the house he much preferred his own room to any other .
Parsing [sent. 210 len. 28]: This room , not so large as the kitchen-hall , but quite as long , seems to me , when I look back , my earliest surrounding .
Parsing [sent. 211 len. 30]: It was the centre from which my roving fancies issued as from their source , and the end of their journey to which as to their home they returned .
Parsing [sent. 212 len. 6]: It was a curious place .
Parsing [sent. 213 len. 34]: Were you to see first the inside of the house and then the outside , you would find yourself at a loss to conjecture where within it could be situated such a room .
Parsing [sent. 214 len. 34]: It was not , however , contained in what , to a cursory glance , passed for the habitable house , and a stranger would not easily have found the entrance to it .
Parsing [sent. 215 len. 18]: Both its nature and situation were in keeping with certain peculiarities of my uncle 's mental being .
Parsing [sent. 216 len. 7]: He was given to curious inquiries .
Parsing [sent. 217 len. 28]: He would set out to solve now one now another historical point as odd as uninteresting to any but a mind capable of starting such a question .
Parsing [sent. 218 len. 67]: To determine it , he would search book after book , as if it were a live thing , in whose memory must remain , darkly stored , thousands of facts , requiring only to be recollected : amongst them might nestle the thing he sought , and he would dig for it as in a mine that went branching through the hardened dust of ages .
Parsing [sent. 219 len. 40]: I fancy he read any old book whatever of English history with the haunting sense that next moment he might come upon the trace of certain of his own ancestors of whom he specially desired to enlarge his knowledge .
Parsing [sent. 220 len. 60]: Whether he started any new thing in mathematics I can not tell , but he would sit absorbed , every day and all day long , for weeks , over his slate , suddenly throw it down , walk out for the rest of the day , and leave his calculus , or whatever it was , for months .
Parsing [sent. 221 len. 17]: He read Shakespeare as with a microscope , propounding and answering the most curious little questions .
Parsing [sent. 222 len. 36]: It seemed to me sometimes , I confess , that he missed a plain point from his eyes being so sharp that they looked through it without seeing it , having focused themselves beyond it .
Parsing [sent. 223 len. 33]: A specimen of the kind of question he would ask and answer himself , occurs to me as I write , for he put it to me once as we read together .
Parsing [sent. 224 len. 30]: `` Why , '' he said , `` did Margaret , in _ Much ado about Nothing _ , try to persuade Hero to wear her other rabato ? ''
Parsing [sent. 225 len. 33]: And the answer was , `` Because she feared her mistress would find out that she had been wearing it -- namely , the night before , when she personated her . ''
Parsing [sent. 226 len. 37]: And here I may put down a remark I heard him make in reference to a theory which itself must seem nothing less than idiotic to any one who knows Shakespeare as my uncle knew him .
Parsing [sent. 227 len. 88]: The remark was this -- that whoever sought to enhance the fame of lord St. Alban 's -- he was careful to use the real title -- by attributing to him the works of Shakespeare , must either be a man of weak intellect , of great ignorance , or of low moral perception ; for he cast on the memory of a man already more to be pitied than any , a weight of obloquy such as it were hard to believe anyone capable of deserving .
Parsing [sent. 228 len. 48]: A being with Shakespeare 's love of human nature , and Bacon 's insight into essential truth , guilty of the moral and social atrocities into which his lordship 's eagerness after money for scientific research betrayed him , would be a monster as grotesque as abominable .
Parsing [sent. 229 len. 27]: I record the remark the rather that it shows my uncle could look at things in a large way as well as hunt with a knife-edge .
Parsing [sent. 230 len. 32]: At the same time , devoutly as I honour him , I can not but count him intended for thinkings of larger scope than such as then seemed characteristic of him .
Parsing [sent. 231 len. 18]: I imagine his early history had affected his faculties , and influenced the mode of their working .
Parsing [sent. 232 len. 8]: How indeed could it have been otherwise !
Parsing [sent. 233 len. 3]: CHAPTER IV .
Parsing [sent. 234 len. 11]: MY UNCLE 'S ROOM , AND MY UNCLE IN IT .
Parsing [sent. 235 len. 27]: At right angles to the long , black and white house , stood a building behind it , of possibly earlier date , but uncertain intent .
Parsing [sent. 236 len. 21]: It had been used for many things before my uncle 's time -- once as part of a small brewery .
Parsing [sent. 237 len. 35]: My uncle was positive that , whether built for the purpose or not , it had been used as a chapel , and that the house was originally the out-lying cell of some convent .
Parsing [sent. 238 len. 45]: The signs on which he founded this conclusion , I was never able to appreciate : to me , as containing my uncle 's study , the wonder-house of my childhood , it was far more interesting than any history could have made it .
Parsing [sent. 239 len. 15]: It had very thick walls , two low stories , and a high roof .
Parsing [sent. 240 len. 63]: Entering it from the court behind the house , every portion of it would seem to an ordinary beholder quite accounted for ; but it might have suggested itself to a more comprehending observer , that a considerable space must lie between the roof and the low ceiling of the first floor , which was taken up with the servants ' rooms .
Parsing [sent. 241 len. 35]: Of the ground floor , part was used as a dairy , part as a woodhouse , part for certain vegetables , while part stored the turf dug for fuel from the neighbouring moor .
Parsing [sent. 242 len. 17]: Between this building and the house was a smaller and lower erection , a mere out-house .
Parsing [sent. 243 len. 84]: It also was strongly built , however , and the roof , in perfect condition , seemed newer than the walls : it had been raised and strengthened when used by my uncle to contain a passage leading from the house to the roof of the building just described , in which he was fashioning for himself the retreat which he rightly called his study , for few must be the rooms more continuously thought and read in during one lifetime than this .
Parsing [sent. 244 len. 13]: I have now to tell how it was reached from the house .
Parsing [sent. 245 len. 32]: You could hardly have found the way to it , even had you set yourself seriously to the task , without having in you a good share of the constructive faculty .
Parsing [sent. 246 len. 34]: The whole was my uncle 's contrivance , but might well have been supposed to belong to the troubled times when a good hiding-place would have added to the value of any home .
Parsing [sent. 247 len. 41]: There was a large recess in the kitchen , of which the hearth , raised a foot or so above the flagged floor , had filled the whole -- a huge chimney in fact , built out from the wall .
Parsing [sent. 248 len. 36]: At some later time an oblong space had been cut out of the hearth to a level with the floor , and in it an iron grate constructed for the more convenient burning of coal .
Parsing [sent. 249 len. 15]: Hence the remnant of the raised hearth looked like wide hobs to the grate .
Parsing [sent. 250 len. 27]: The recess as a chimney-corner was thereby spoiled , for coal makes a very different kind of smoke from the aromatic product of wood or peat .
Parsing [sent. 251 len. 17]: Right and left within the recess , were two common , unpainted doors , with latches .
Parsing [sent. 252 len. 33]: If you opened either , you found an ordinary shallow cupboard , that on the right filled with shelves and crockery , that on the left with brooms and other household implements .
Parsing [sent. 253 len. 55]: But if , in the frame of the door to the left , you pressed what looked like the head of a large nail , not its door only but the whole cupboard turned inward on unseen hinges , and revealed an ascending stair , which was the approach to my uncle 's room .
Parsing [sent. 254 len. 42]: At the head of the stair you went through the wall of the house to the passage under the roof of the out-house , at the end of which a few more steps led up to the door of the study .
Parsing [sent. 255 len. 13]: By that door you entered the roof of the more ancient building .
Parsing [sent. 256 len. 37]: Lighted almost entirely from above , there was no indication outside of the existence of this floor , except one tiny window , with vaguely pointed arch , almost in the very top of the gable .
Parsing [sent. 257 len. 13]: Here lay my nest ; this was the bower of my bliss .
Parsing [sent. 258 len. 38]: Its walls rose but about three feet from the floor ere the slope of the roof began , so that there was a considerable portion of the room in which my tall uncle could not stand upright .
Parsing [sent. 259 len. 30]: There was width enough notwithstanding , in which four as tall as he might have walked abreast up and down a length of at least five and thirty feet .
Parsing [sent. 260 len. 27]: Not merely the low walls , but the slopes of the roof were filled with books as high as the narrow level portion of the ceiling .
Parsing [sent. 261 len. 12]: On the slopes the bookshelves had of course to be peculiar .
Parsing [sent. 262 len. 24]: My uncle had contrived , and partly himself made them , with the assistance of a carpenter he had known all his life .
Parsing [sent. 263 len. 15]: They were individually fixed to the rafters , each projecting over that beneath it .
Parsing [sent. 264 len. 29]: To get at the highest , he had to stand on a few steps ; to reach the lowest , he had to stoop at a right angle .
Parsing [sent. 265 len. 9]: The place was almost a tunnel of books .
Parsing [sent. 266 len. 65]: By setting a chair on an ancient chest that stood against the gable , and a footstool on the chair , I could mount high enough to get into the deep embrasure of the little window , whence alone to gain a glimpse of the lower world , while from the floor I could see heaven through six skylights , deep framed in books .
Parsing [sent. 267 len. 35]: As far back as I can remember , it was my care to see that the inside of their glass was always bright , so that sun and moon and stars might look in .
Parsing [sent. 268 len. 124]: The books were mostly in old and dingy bindings , but there were a few to attract the eyes of a child -- especially some annuals , in red skil , or embossed leather , or , most bewitching of all , in paper , protected by a tight case of the same , from which , with the help of a ribbon , you drew out the precious little green volume , with its gilt edges and lovely engravings -- one of which in particular I remember -- a castle in the distance , a wood , a ghastly man at the head of a rearing horse , and a white , mist-like , fleeting ghost , the cause of the consternation .
Parsing [sent. 269 len. 13]: These books had a large share in the witchery of the chamber .
Parsing [sent. 270 len. 44]: At the end of the room , near the gable-window , but under one of the skylights , was a table of white deal , without cover , at which my uncle generally sat , sometimes writing , oftener leaning over a book .
Parsing [sent. 271 len. 48]: Occasionally , however , he would occupy a large old-fashioned easy chair , under the slope of the roof , in the same end of the room , sitting silent , neither writing nor reading , his eyes fixed straight before him , but plainly upon nothing .
Parsing [sent. 272 len. 17]: They looked as if sights were going out of them rather than coming in at them .
Parsing [sent. 273 len. 12]: When he sat thus , I would sit gazing at him .
Parsing [sent. 274 len. 16]: Oh how I loved him -- loved every line of his gentle , troubled countenance !
Parsing [sent. 275 len. 17]: I do not remember the time when I did not know that his face was troubled .
Parsing [sent. 276 len. 12]: It gave the last finishing tenderness to my love for him .
Parsing [sent. 277 len. 50]: It was from no meddlesome curiosity that I sat watching him , from no longing to learn what he was thinking about , or what pictures were going and coming before the eyes of his mind , but from such a longing to comfort him as amounted to pain .
Parsing [sent. 278 len. 52]: I think it was the desire to be near him -- in spirit , I mean , for I could be near him in the body any time except when he was out on one of his lonely walks or rides -- that made me attend so closely to my studies .
Parsing [sent. 279 len. 32]: He taught me everything , and I yearned to please him , but without this other half-conscious yearning I do not believe I should ever have made the progress he praised .
Parsing [sent. 280 len. 43]: I took indeed a true delight in learning , but I would not so often have shut the book I was enjoying to the full and taken up another , but for the sight or the thought of my uncle 's countenance .
Parsing [sent. 281 len. 30]: I think he never once sat down in the chair I have mentioned without sooner or later rising hurriedly , and going out on one of his solitary rambles .
Parsing [sent. 282 len. 40]: When we were having our lessons together , as he phrased it , we sat at the table side by side , and he taught me as if we were two children finding out together what it all meant .
Parsing [sent. 283 len. 79]: Those lessons had , I think , the largest share in the charm of the place ; yet when , as not unfrequently , my uncle would , in the middle of one of them , rise abruptly and leave me without a word , to go , I knew , far away from the house , I was neither dismayed nor uneasy : I had got used to the thing before I could wonder what it meant .
Parsing [sent. 284 len. 30]: I would just go back to the book I had been reading , or to any other that attracted me : he never required the preparation of any lessons .
Parsing [sent. 285 len. 53]: It was of no use to climb to the window in the hope of catching sight of him , for thence was nothing to be seen immediately below but the tops of high trees and a corner of the yard into which the cow-houses opened , and my uncle was never there .
Parsing [sent. 286 len. 8]: He neither understood nor cared about farming .
Parsing [sent. 287 len. 29]: His elder brother , my father , had been bred to carry on the yeoman-line of the family , and my uncle was trained to the medical profession .
Parsing [sent. 288 len. 44]: My father dying rather suddenly , my uncle , who was abroad at the time , and had not begun to practise , returned to take his place , but never paid practical attention to the farming any more than to his profession .
Parsing [sent. 289 len. 27]: He gave the land in charge to a bailiff , and at once settled down , Martha told me , into what we now saw him .
Parsing [sent. 290 len. 36]: She seemed to imply that grief at my father 's death was the cause of his depression , but I soon came to the conclusion that it lasted too long to be so accounted for .
Parsing [sent. 291 len. 45]: Gradually I grew aware -- so gradually that at length I seemed to have known it from the first -- that the soul of my uncle was harassed with an undying trouble , that some worm lay among the very roots of his life .
Parsing [sent. 292 len. 16]: What change could ever dispel such a sadness as I often saw in that chair !
Parsing [sent. 293 len. 48]: Now and then he would sit there for hours , an open book in his hand perhaps , at which he cast never a glance , all unaware of the eyes of the small maiden fixed upon him , with a whole world of sympathy behind them .
Parsing [sent. 294 len. 35]: I suspect , however , as I believe I have said , that Martha Moon , in her silence , had pierced the heart of the mystery , though she _ knew _ nothing .
Parsing [sent. 295 len. 33]: One practical lesson given me now and then in varying form by my uncle , I at length , one day , suddenly and involuntarily associated with the darkness that haunted him .
Parsing [sent. 296 len. 21]: In substance it was this : `` Never , my little one , hide anything from those that love you .
Parsing [sent. 297 len. 32]: Never let anything that makes itself a nest in your heart , grow into a secret , for then at once it will begin to eat a hole in it . ''
Parsing [sent. 298 len. 20]: He would so often say the kind of thing , that I seemed to know when it was coming .
Parsing [sent. 299 len. 29]: But I had heard it as a thing of course , never realizing its truth , and listening to it only because he whom I loved said it .
Parsing [sent. 300 len. 30]: I see with my mind 's eye the fine small head and large eyes so far above me , as we sit beside each other at the deal table .
Parsing [sent. 301 len. 11]: He looked down on me like a bird of prey .
Parsing [sent. 302 len. 28]: His hair -- gray , Martha told me , before he was thirty -- was tufted out a little , like ruffled feathers , on each side .
Parsing [sent. 303 len. 17]: But the eyes were not those of an eagle ; they were a dove 's eyes .
Parsing [sent. 304 len. 18]: `` A secret , little one , is a mole that burrows , '' said my uncle .
Parsing [sent. 305 len. 7]: The moment of insight was come .
Parsing [sent. 306 len. 22]: A voice seemed suddenly to say within me , `` He has a secret ; it is biting his heart ! ''
Parsing [sent. 307 len. 20]: My affection , my devotion , my sacred concern for him , as suddenly swelled to twice their size .
Parsing [sent. 308 len. 17]: It was as if a God were in pain , and I could not help him .
Parsing [sent. 309 len. 19]: I had no desire to learn his secret ; I only yearned heart and soul to comfort him .
Parsing [sent. 310 len. 51]: Before long , I had a secret myself for half a day : ever after , I shared so in the trouble of his secret , that I seemed myself to possess or rather to be possessed by one -- such a secret that I did not myself know it .
Parsing [sent. 311 len. 37]: But in truth I had a secret then ; for the moment I knew that he had a secret , his secret -- the outward fact of its existence , I mean -- was my secret .
Parsing [sent. 312 len. 16]: And besides this secret of his , I had then a secret of my own .
Parsing [sent. 313 len. 19]: For I knew that my uncle had a secret , and he did not know that I knew .
Parsing [sent. 314 len. 15]: Therewith came , of course , the question -- Ought I to tell him ?
Parsing [sent. 315 len. 23]: At once , by the instinct of love , I saw that to tell him would put him in a great difficulty .
Parsing [sent. 316 len. 38]: He might wish me never to let any one else know of it , and how could he say so when he had been constantly warning me to let nothing grow to a secret in my heart ?
Parsing [sent. 317 len. 62]: As to telling Martha Moon , much as I loved her , much as I knew she loved my uncle , and sure as I was that anything concerning him was as sacred to her as to me , I dared not commit such a breach of confidence as even to think in her presence that my uncle had a secret .
Parsing [sent. 318 len. 41]: From that hour I had recurrent fits of a morbid terror at the very idea of a secret -- as if a secret were in itself a treacherous , poisonous guest , that ate away the life of its host .
Parsing [sent. 319 len. 11]: But to return , my half-day-secret came in this wise .
Parsing [sent. 320 len. 6]: CHAPTER V. MY FIRST SECRET .
Parsing [sent. 321 len. 11]: I was one morning with my uncle in his room .
Parsing [sent. 322 len. 46]: Lessons were over , and I was reading a marvellous story in one of my favourite annuals : my uncle had so taught me from infancy the right handling of books , that he would have trusted me with the most valuable in his possession .
Parsing [sent. 323 len. 28]: I do not know how old I was , but that is no matter ; man or woman is aged according to the development of the conscience .
Parsing [sent. 324 len. 18]: Looking up , I saw him stooping over an open drawer in a cabinet behind the door .
Parsing [sent. 325 len. 22]: I sat on the great chest under the gable-window , and was away from him the whole length of the room .
Parsing [sent. 326 len. 51]: He had never told me not to look at him , had never seemed to object to the presence of my eyes on anything he did , and as a matter of course I sat observing him , partly because I had never seen any portion of that cabinet open .
Parsing [sent. 327 len. 36]: He turned towards the sky-light near him , and held up between him and it a small something , of which I could just see that it was red , and shone in the light .
Parsing [sent. 328 len. 21]: Then he turned hurriedly , threw it in the drawer , and went straight out , leaving the drawer open .
Parsing [sent. 329 len. 11]: I knew I had lost his company for the day .
Parsing [sent. 330 len. 25]: The moment he was gone , the phantasm of the pretty thing he had been looking at so intently , came back to me .
Parsing [sent. 331 len. 25]: Somehow I seemed to understand that I had no right to know what it was , seeing my uncle had not shown it me !
Parsing [sent. 332 len. 12]: At the same time I had no law to guide me .
Parsing [sent. 333 len. 17]: He had never said I was not to look at this or that in the room .
Parsing [sent. 334 len. 31]: If he had , even if the cabinet had not been mentioned , I do not think I should have offended ; but that does not make the fault less .
Parsing [sent. 335 len. 46]: For which is the more guilty -- the man who knows there is a law against doing a certain thing and does it , or the man who feels an authority in the depth of his nature forbidding the thing , and yet does it ?
Parsing [sent. 336 len. 9]: Surely the latter is greatly the more guilty .
Parsing [sent. 337 len. 9]: I rose , and went to the cabinet .
Parsing [sent. 338 len. 62]: But when the contents of the drawer began to show themselves as I drew near , `` I closed my lids , and kept them close , '' until I had seated myself on the floor , with my back to the cabinet , and the drawer projecting over my head like the shelf of a bracket over its supporting figure .
Parsing [sent. 339 len. 15]: I could touch it with the top of my head by straightening my back .
Parsing [sent. 340 len. 32]: How long I sat there motionless , I can not say , but it seems in retrospect at least a week , such a multitude of thinkings went through my mind .
Parsing [sent. 341 len. 50]: The logical discussion of a thing that has to be done , a thing awaiting action and not decision -- the experiment , that is , whether the duty or the temptation has the more to say for itself , is one of the straight roads to the pit .
Parsing [sent. 342 len. 45]: Similarly , there are multitudes who lose their lives pondering what they ought to believe , while something lies at their door waiting to be done , and rendering it impossible for him who makes it wait , ever to know what to believe .
Parsing [sent. 343 len. 19]: Only a pure heart can understand , and a pure heart is one that sends out ready hands .
Parsing [sent. 344 len. 74]: I knew perfectly well what I ought to do -- namely , to shut that drawer with the back of my head , then get up and do something , and forget the shining stone I had seen betwixt my uncle 's finger and thumb ; yet there I sat debating whether I was not at liberty to do in my uncle 's room what he had not told me not to do .
Parsing [sent. 345 len. 23]: I will not weary my reader with any further description of the evil path by which I arrived at the evil act .
Parsing [sent. 346 len. 36]: To myself it is pain even now to tell that I got on my feet , saw a blaze of shining things , banged-to the drawer , and knew that Eve had eaten the apple .
Parsing [sent. 347 len. 20]: The eyes of my consciousness were opened to the evil in me , through the evil done by me .
Parsing [sent. 348 len. 18]: Evil seemed now a part of myself , so that nevermore should I get rid of it .
Parsing [sent. 349 len. 29]: It may be easy for one regarding it from afar , through the telescope only of a book , to exclaim , `` Such a little thing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 350 len. 12]: but it was I who did it , and not another !
Parsing [sent. 351 len. 24]: it was I , and only I , who could know what I had done , and it was not a little thing !
Parsing [sent. 352 len. 16]: That peep into my uncle 's drawer lies in my soul the type of sin .
Parsing [sent. 353 len. 34]: Never have I done anything wrong with such a clear assurance that I was doing wrong , as when I did the thing I had taken most pains to reason out as right .
Parsing [sent. 354 len. 18]: Like one stunned by an electric shock , I had neither feeling nor care left for anything .
Parsing [sent. 355 len. 44]: I walked to the end of the long room , as far as I could go from the scene of my crime , and sat down on the great chest , with my coffin , the cabinet , facing me in the distance .
Parsing [sent. 356 len. 16]: The first thing , I think , that I grew conscious of , was dreariness .
Parsing [sent. 357 len. 6]: There was nothing interesting anywhere .
Parsing [sent. 358 len. 5]: What should I do ?
Parsing [sent. 359 len. 17]: There was nothing to do , nothing to think about , not a book worth reading .
Parsing [sent. 360 len. 9]: Story was suddenly dried up at its fountain .
Parsing [sent. 361 len. 7]: Life was a plain without water-brooks .
Parsing [sent. 362 len. 27]: If the sky was not `` a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours , '' it was nothing better than a canopy of gray and blue .
Parsing [sent. 363 len. 35]: By degrees my thought settled on what I had done , and in a moment I realized it as it was -- a vile thing , and I had lost my life for it !
Parsing [sent. 364 len. 15]: This is the nearest I can come to the expression of what I felt .
Parsing [sent. 365 len. 6]: I was simply in despair .
Parsing [sent. 366 len. 24]: I had done wrong , and the world had closed in upon me ; the sky had come down and was crushing me !
Parsing [sent. 367 len. 8]: The lid of my coffin was closed !
Parsing [sent. 368 len. 7]: I should come no more out !
Parsing [sent. 369 len. 12]: But deliverance came speedily -- and in how lovely a way !
Parsing [sent. 370 len. 13]: Into my thought , not into the room , came my uncle !
Parsing [sent. 371 len. 16]: Present to my deepest consciousness , he stood tall , loving , beautiful , sad .
Parsing [sent. 372 len. 25]: I read no rebuke in his countenance , only sorrow that I had sinned , and sympathy with my suffering because of my sin .
Parsing [sent. 373 len. 36]: Then first I knew that I had _ wronged _ him in looking into his drawer ; then first I saw it was his being that made the thing I had done an evil thing .
Parsing [sent. 374 len. 19]: If the drawer had been nobody 's , there would have been no wrong in looking into it !
Parsing [sent. 375 len. 17]: And what made it so very bad was that my uncle was so good to me !
Parsing [sent. 376 len. 10]: With the discovery came a rush of gladsome relief .
Parsing [sent. 377 len. 24]: Strange to say , with the clearer perception of the greatness of the wrong I had done , came the gladness of redemption .
Parsing [sent. 378 len. 24]: It was almost a pure joy to find that it was against my uncle , my own uncle , that I had sinned !
Parsing [sent. 379 len. 19]: That joy was the first gleam through a darkness that had seemed settled on my soul for ever .
Parsing [sent. 380 len. 54]: But a brighter followed ; for thus spake the truth within me : `` The thing is in your uncle 's hands ; he is the lord of the wrong you have done ; it is to him it makes you a debtor : -- he loves you , and will forgive you .
Parsing [sent. 381 len. 5]: Of course he will !
Parsing [sent. 382 len. 24]: He can not make undone what is done , but he will comfort you , and find some way of setting things right .
Parsing [sent. 383 len. 6]: There must be some way !
Parsing [sent. 384 len. 14]: I can not be doomed to be a contemptible child to all eternity !
Parsing [sent. 385 len. 15]: It is so easy to go wrong , and so hard to get right !
Parsing [sent. 386 len. 6]: He must help me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 387 len. 21]: I sat the rest of the day alone in that solitary room , away from Martha and Rover and everybody .
Parsing [sent. 388 len. 21]: I would that even now in my old age I waited for God as then I waited for my uncle !
Parsing [sent. 389 len. 29]: If only he would come , that I might pour out the story of my fall , for I had sinned after the similitude of Adam 's transgression !
Parsing [sent. 390 len. 15]: -- only I was worse , for neither serpent nor wife had tempted me !
Parsing [sent. 391 len. 8]: At tea-time Martha came to find me .
Parsing [sent. 392 len. 7]: I would not go with her .
Parsing [sent. 393 len. 10]: She would bring me my tea , she said .
Parsing [sent. 394 len. 7]: I would not have any tea .
Parsing [sent. 395 len. 16]: With a look like that she sometimes cast on my uncle , she left me .
Parsing [sent. 396 len. 3]: Dear Martha !
Parsing [sent. 397 len. 9]: she had the lovely gift of leaving alone .
Parsing [sent. 398 len. 16]: That evening there was no tea in the house ; Martha did not have any .
Parsing [sent. 399 len. 20]: With the conceit peculiar to repentance and humiliation , I took a curious satisfaction in being hard on myself .
Parsing [sent. 400 len. 58]: I could have taken my meal tolerably well : with the new hope in my uncle as my saviour , came comfort enough for the natural process of getting hungry , and desiring food ; but with common , indeed vulgar foolishness , my own righteousness in taking vengeance on my fault was a satisfaction to me .
Parsing [sent. 401 len. 30]: I did not then see the presumption of the sinner 's taking vengeance on her own fault , did not see that I had no right to do that .
Parsing [sent. 402 len. 8]: For how should a thing defiled punish ?
Parsing [sent. 403 len. 47]: With all my great joy in the discovery that the fault was against my uncle , I forgot that therefore I was in his jurisdiction , that he only had to deal with it , he alone could punish , as he alone could forgive it .
Parsing [sent. 404 len. 16]: It was the end of August , and the night stole swiftly upon the day .
Parsing [sent. 405 len. 13]: It began to grow very dusk , but I would not stir .
Parsing [sent. 406 len. 16]: I and the cabinet kept each other dismal company while the gloom deepened into night .
Parsing [sent. 407 len. 17]: Nor did the night part us , for I and the cabinet filled all the darkness .
Parsing [sent. 408 len. 19]: Had my uncle remained the whole night away , I believe I should have sat till he came .
Parsing [sent. 409 len. 21]: But , happily both for my mental suffering and my bodily endurance , he returned sooner than many a time .
Parsing [sent. 410 len. 6]: I heard the house-door open .
Parsing [sent. 411 len. 24]: I knew he would come to the study before going to his bedroom , and my heart gave a bound of awe-filled eagerness .
Parsing [sent. 412 len. 44]: I knew also that Martha never spoke to him when he returned from one of his late rambles , and that he would not know I was there : long before she died Martha knew how grateful he was for her delicate consideration .
Parsing [sent. 413 len. 30]: Martha Moon was not one of this world 's ladies ; but there is a country where the social question is not , `` Is she a lady ? ''
Parsing [sent. 414 len. 12]: but , `` How much of a woman is she ? ''
Parsing [sent. 415 len. 17]: Martha 's name must , I think , stand well up in the book of life .
Parsing [sent. 416 len. 22]: My uncle , then , approached his room without knowing there was a live kernel to the dark that filled it .
Parsing [sent. 417 len. 30]: I hearkened to every nearer step as he came up the stair , along the corridor , and up the short final ascent to the door of the study .
Parsing [sent. 418 len. 36]: I had crept from my place to the middle of the room , and , without a thought of consequences , stood waiting the arrival through the dark , of my deliverer from the dark .
Parsing [sent. 419 len. 28]: I did not know that many a man who would face a battery calmly , will spring a yard aside if a yelping cur dart at him .
Parsing [sent. 420 len. 12]: My uncle opened the door , and closed it behind him .
Parsing [sent. 421 len. 20]: His lamp and matches stood ready on his table : it was my part to see they were there .
Parsing [sent. 422 len. 22]: With a sigh , which seemed to seek me in the darkness and find me , he came forward through it .
Parsing [sent. 423 len. 12]: I caught him round the legs , and clung to him .
Parsing [sent. 424 len. 16]: He gave a great gasp and a smothered cry , staggered , and nearly fell .
Parsing [sent. 425 len. 5]: `` My God ! ''
Parsing [sent. 426 len. 3]: he murmured .
Parsing [sent. 427 len. 3]: `` Uncle !
Parsing [sent. 428 len. 3]: uncle ! ''
Parsing [sent. 429 len. 15]: I cried , in greater terror than he ; `` it 's only Orbie !
Parsing [sent. 430 len. 8]: It 's only your little one ! ''
Parsing [sent. 431 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 432 len. 11]: it 's only my little one , is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 433 len. 33]: he rejoined , at once recovering his equanimity , and not for a moment losing the temper so ready , like nervous cat , to spring from most of us when startled .
Parsing [sent. 434 len. 15]: He caught me up in his arms , and held me to his heart .
Parsing [sent. 435 len. 10]: I could feel it beat against my little person .
Parsing [sent. 436 len. 3]: `` Uncle !
Parsing [sent. 437 len. 3]: uncle ! ''
Parsing [sent. 438 len. 4]: I cried again .
Parsing [sent. 439 len. 4]: `` Do n't !
Parsing [sent. 440 len. 4]: Do n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 441 len. 11]: `` Did I hurt you , my little one ? ''
Parsing [sent. 442 len. 20]: he said , and relaxing his embrace , held me more gently , but did not set me down .
Parsing [sent. 443 len. 6]: `` No , no ! ''
Parsing [sent. 444 len. 3]: I answered .
Parsing [sent. 445 len. 19]: `` But I 've got a secret , and you must n't kiss me till it is gone .
Parsing [sent. 446 len. 12]: I wish there was a swine to send it into ! ''
Parsing [sent. 447 len. 9]: `` Give it to me , little one .
Parsing [sent. 448 len. 11]: I will treat it better than a swine would . ''
Parsing [sent. 449 len. 10]: `` But it must n't be treated , uncle !
Parsing [sent. 450 len. 6]: It might come again ! ''
Parsing [sent. 451 len. 11]: `` There is no fear of that , my child !
Parsing [sent. 452 len. 12]: As soon as a secret is told , it is dead .
Parsing [sent. 453 len. 8]: It is a secret no longer . ''
Parsing [sent. 454 len. 9]: `` Will it be dead , uncle ? ''
Parsing [sent. 455 len. 4]: I returned . ''
Parsing [sent. 456 len. 20]: -- But it will be there , all the same , when it is dead -- an ugly thing .
Parsing [sent. 457 len. 13]: It will only put off its cloak , and show itself ! ''
Parsing [sent. 458 len. 13]: `` All secrets are not ugly things when their cloaks are off .
Parsing [sent. 459 len. 13]: The cloak may be the ugly thing , and nothing else . ''
Parsing [sent. 460 len. 12]: He stood in the dark , holding me in his arms .
Parsing [sent. 461 len. 37]: But the clouds had cleared off a little , and though there was no moon , I could see the dim blue of the sky-lights , and a little shine from the gray of his hair .
Parsing [sent. 462 len. 18]: `` But mine is an ugly thing , '' I said , `` and I hate it .
Parsing [sent. 463 len. 10]: Please let me put it out of my mouth .
Parsing [sent. 464 len. 8]: Perhaps then it will go dead . ''
Parsing [sent. 465 len. 9]: `` Out with it , little one . ''
Parsing [sent. 466 len. 11]: `` Put me down , please , '' I returned .
Parsing [sent. 467 len. 22]: He walked to the old chest under the gable-window , seated himself on it , and set me down beside him .
Parsing [sent. 468 len. 23]: I slipped from the chest , and knelt on the floor at his feet , a little way in front of him .
Parsing [sent. 469 len. 15]: I did not touch him , and all was again quite dark about us .
Parsing [sent. 470 len. 25]: I told him my story from beginning to end , along with a great part of my meditations while hesitating to do the deed .
Parsing [sent. 471 len. 35]: I felt very choky , but forced my way through , talking with a throat that did not seem my own , and sending out a voice I seemed never to have heard before .
Parsing [sent. 472 len. 16]: The moment I ceased , a sound like a sob came out of the darkness .
Parsing [sent. 473 len. 9]: Was it possible my big uncle was crying ?
Parsing [sent. 474 len. 9]: Then indeed there was no hope for me !
Parsing [sent. 475 len. 17]: He was horrified at my wickedness , and very sorry to have to give me up !
Parsing [sent. 476 len. 7]: I howled like a wild beast .
Parsing [sent. 477 len. 11]: `` Please , uncle , will you kill me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 478 len. 18]: I cried , through a riot of sobs that came from me like potatoes from a sack .
Parsing [sent. 479 len. 14]: `` Yes , yes , I will kill you , my darling ! ''
Parsing [sent. 480 len. 8]: he answered , '' -- this way !
Parsing [sent. 481 len. 4]: this way ! ''
Parsing [sent. 482 len. 24]: and stretching out his arms he found me in the dark , drew me to him , and covered my face with kisses .
Parsing [sent. 483 len. 31]: `` Now , '' he resumed , `` I 've killed you alive again , and the ugly secret is dead , and will never come to life any more .
Parsing [sent. 484 len. 17]: And I think , besides , we have killed the hen that lays the egg-secrets ! ''
Parsing [sent. 485 len. 26]: He rose with me in his arms , set me down on the chest , lighted his lamp , and carried it to the cabinet .
Parsing [sent. 486 len. 38]: Then he returned , and taking me by the hand , led me to it , opened wide the drawer of offence , lifted me , and held me so that I could see well into it .
Parsing [sent. 487 len. 23]: The light flashed in a hundred glories of colour from a multitude of cut but unset stones that lay loose in it .
Parsing [sent. 488 len. 21]: I soon learned that most of them were of small money-value , but their beauty was none the less entrancing .
Parsing [sent. 489 len. 26]: There were stones of price among them , however , and these were the first he taught me , because they were the most beautiful .
Parsing [sent. 490 len. 23]: My fault had opened a new source of delight : my stone-lesson was now one of the great pleasures of the week .
Parsing [sent. 491 len. 42]: In after years I saw in it the richness of God not content with setting right what is wrong , but making from it a gain : he will not have his children the worse for the wrong they have done !
Parsing [sent. 492 len. 12]: We shall lose nothing by it : he is our father !
Parsing [sent. 493 len. 12]: For the hurting sand-grain , he gives his oyster a pearl .
Parsing [sent. 494 len. 38]: `` There , '' said my uncle , `` you may look at them as often as you please ; only mind you put every one back as soon as you have satisfied your eyes with it .
Parsing [sent. 495 len. 18]: You must not put one in your pocket , or carry it about in your hand . ''
Parsing [sent. 496 len. 23]: Then he set me down , saying , `` Now you must go to bed , and dream about the pretty things .
Parsing [sent. 497 len. 13]: I will tell you a lot of stories about them afterward . ''
Parsing [sent. 498 len. 15]: We had a way of calling any kind of statement _ a story _ .
Parsing [sent. 499 len. 31]: I never cared to ask how it was that , seeing all the same I had done the wrong thing , the whole weight of it was gone from me .
Parsing [sent. 500 len. 23]: So utterly was it gone , that I did not even inquire whether I ought so to let it pass from me .
Parsing [sent. 501 len. 4]: It was nowhere .
Parsing [sent. 502 len. 19]: In the fire of my uncle 's love to me and mine to him , the thing vanished .
Parsing [sent. 503 len. 4]: It was annihilated .
Parsing [sent. 504 len. 39]: Should I not be a creature unworthy of life , if , now in my old age , I , who had such an uncle in my childhood , did not with my very life believe in God ?
Parsing [sent. 505 len. 62]: I have wondered whether , if my father had lived to bring me up instead of my uncle , I should have been very different ; but the useless speculation has only driven me to believe that the relations on the surface of life are but the symbols of far deeper ties , which may exist without those correspondent external ones .
Parsing [sent. 506 len. 54]: At the same time , now that , being old , I naturally think of the coming change , I feel that , when I see my father , I shall have a different feeling for him just because he is my father , although my uncle did all the fatherly toward me .
Parsing [sent. 507 len. 20]: But we need not trouble ourselves about our hearts , and all their varying hues and shades of feeling .
Parsing [sent. 508 len. 38]: Truth is at the root of all existence , therefore everything must come right if only we are obedient to the truth ; and right is the deepest satisfaction of every creature as well as of God .
Parsing [sent. 509 len. 5]: I wait in confidence .
Parsing [sent. 510 len. 30]: If things be not as we think , they will both arouse and satisfy a better _ think _ , making us glad they are not as we expected .
Parsing [sent. 511 len. 3]: CHAPTER VI .
Parsing [sent. 512 len. 4]: I LOSE MYSELF .
Parsing [sent. 513 len. 19]: I have one incident more to relate ere my narrative begins to flow from a quite clear memory .
Parsing [sent. 514 len. 24]: I was by no means a small bookworm , neither spent all my time in the enchanted ground of my uncle 's study .
Parsing [sent. 515 len. 47]: It is true I loved the house , and often felt like a burrowing animal that would rather not leave its hole ; but occasionally even at such times would suddenly wake the passion for the open air : I must get into it or die !
Parsing [sent. 516 len. 20]: I was well known in the farmyard , not to the men only , but to the animals also .
Parsing [sent. 517 len. 16]: In the absence of human playfellows , they did much to keep me from selfishness .
Parsing [sent. 518 len. 13]: But far beyond it I took no unfrequent flight -- always alone .
Parsing [sent. 519 len. 28]: Neither Martha nor my uncle ever seemed to think I needed looking after ; and I am not aware that I should have gained anything by it .
Parsing [sent. 520 len. 16]: I speak for myself ; I have no theories about the bringing up of children .
Parsing [sent. 521 len. 16]: I went where and when I pleased , as little challenged as my uncle himself .
Parsing [sent. 522 len. 24]: Like him , I took now and then a long ramble over the moor , fearing nothing , and knowing nothing to fear .
Parsing [sent. 523 len. 30]: I went sometimes where it seemed as if human foot could never have trod before , so wild and waste was the prospect , so unknown it somehow looked .
Parsing [sent. 524 len. 30]: The house was built on the more sloping side of a high hollow just within the moor , which stretched wide away from the very edge of the farm .
Parsing [sent. 525 len. 49]: If you climbed the slope , following a certain rough country road , at the top of it you saw on the one side the farm , in all the colours and shades of its outspread , well tilled fields ; on the other side , the heath .
Parsing [sent. 526 len. 36]: If you went another way , through the garden , through the belt of shrubs and pines that encircled it , and through the wilderness behind that , you were at once upon the heath .
Parsing [sent. 527 len. 56]: If then you went as far as the highest point in sight , wading through the heather , among the rocks and great stones which in childhood I never doubted grew also , you saw before you nothing but a wide , wild level , whose horizon was here and there broken by low hills .
Parsing [sent. 528 len. 26]: But the seeming level was far from flat or smooth , as I found on the day of the adventure I am about to relate .
Parsing [sent. 529 len. 9]: I wonder I had never lost myself before .
Parsing [sent. 530 len. 20]: I suppose then first my legs were able to wander beyond the ground with which my eyes were familiar .
Parsing [sent. 531 len. 9]: It had rained all the morning and afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 532 len. 28]: When our last lesson was over , my uncle went out , and I betook myself to the barn , where I amused myself in the straw .
Parsing [sent. 533 len. 46]: By this time Rover must have gone back to his maker , for I remember as with me a large , respectable dog of the old-fashioned mastiff-type , who endured me with a patience that amounted almost to friendliness , but never followed me about .
Parsing [sent. 534 len. 15]: When I grew hungry , I went into the house to have my afternoon-meal .
Parsing [sent. 535 len. 20]: It was called tea , but I knew nothing about tea , while in milk I was a connoisseur .
Parsing [sent. 536 len. 38]: I could tell perfectly to which of the cows I was indebted for the milk I happened at any time to be drinking : Miss Martha never allowed the milks of the different cows to be mingled .
Parsing [sent. 537 len. 18]: Just as my meal was over , the sun shone with sudden brilliance into my very eyes .
Parsing [sent. 538 len. 12]: The storm was breaking up , and vanishing in the west .
Parsing [sent. 539 len. 17]: I threw down my spoon , and ran , hatless as usual , from the house .
Parsing [sent. 540 len. 16]: The sun was on the edge of the hollow ; I made straight for him .
Parsing [sent. 541 len. 23]: The bracken was so wet that my legs almost seemed walking through a brook , and my body through a thick rain .
Parsing [sent. 542 len. 18]: In a moment I was sopping ; but to be wet was of no consequence to me .
Parsing [sent. 543 len. 14]: Not for many years was I able to believe that damp could hurt .
Parsing [sent. 544 len. 30]: When I reached the top , the sun was yet some distance above the horizon , and I had gone a good way toward him before he went down .
Parsing [sent. 545 len. 17]: As he sank he sent up a wind , which blew a sense of coming dark .
Parsing [sent. 546 len. 37]: The wind of the sunset brings me , ever since , a foreboding of tears : it seems to say -- `` Your day is done ; the hour of your darkness is at hand . ''
Parsing [sent. 547 len. 13]: It grew cold , and a feeling of threat filled the air .
Parsing [sent. 548 len. 21]: All about the grave of the buried sun , the clouds were angry with dusky yellow and splashes of gold .
Parsing [sent. 549 len. 6]: They lowered tumulous and menacing .
Parsing [sent. 550 len. 4]: Then , lo !
Parsing [sent. 551 len. 27]: they had lost courage ; their bulk melted off in fierce vapour , gold and gray , and the sharp outcry of their shape was gone .
Parsing [sent. 552 len. 32]: As I recall the airy scene , that horizon looks like the void between a cataclysm and the moving afresh of the spirit of God upon the face of the waters .
Parsing [sent. 553 len. 12]: I went on and on , I do not know why .
Parsing [sent. 554 len. 22]: Something enticed me , or I was plunged in some meditation , then absorbing , now forgotten , not necessarily worthless .
Parsing [sent. 555 len. 19]: I am jealous of moods that can be forgotten , but such may leave traces in the character .
Parsing [sent. 556 len. 4]: I wandered on .
Parsing [sent. 557 len. 7]: What ups and downs there were !
Parsing [sent. 558 len. 9]: how uneven was the surface of the moor !
Parsing [sent. 559 len. 10]: The feet learned what the eyes had not seen .
Parsing [sent. 560 len. 14]: All at once I woke to the fact that mountains hemmed me in .
Parsing [sent. 561 len. 10]: They looked mountains , though they were but hills .
Parsing [sent. 562 len. 6]: What had become of home ?
Parsing [sent. 563 len. 4]: where was it ?
Parsing [sent. 564 len. 31]: The light lingering in the west might surely have shown me the direction of it , but I remember no west -- nothing but a deep hollow and dark hills .
Parsing [sent. 565 len. 4]: I was lost !
Parsing [sent. 566 len. 8]: I was not exactly frightened at first .
Parsing [sent. 567 len. 7]: I knew no cause of dread .
Parsing [sent. 568 len. 16]: I had never seen a tramp even ; I had no sense of the inimical .
Parsing [sent. 569 len. 11]: I knew nothing of the danger from cold and exposure .
Parsing [sent. 570 len. 13]: But awe of the fading light and coming darkness awoke in me .
Parsing [sent. 571 len. 20]: I began to be frightened , and fear is like other live things : once started , it grows .
Parsing [sent. 572 len. 22]: Then first I thought with dismay , which became terror , of the slimy bogs and the deep pools in them .
Parsing [sent. 573 len. 59]: But just as my heart was dying within me , I looked to the hills -- with no hope that from them would come my aid -- and there , on the edge of the sky , lifted against it , in a dip between two of the hills , was the form of a lady on horseback .
Parsing [sent. 574 len. 17]: I could see the skirt of her habit flying out against the clouds as she rode .
Parsing [sent. 575 len. 46]: Had she been a few feet lower , so as to come between me and the side of the hill instead of the sky , I should not have seen her ; neither should I if she had been a few hundred yards further off .
Parsing [sent. 576 len. 21]: I shrieked at the thought that she did not see me , and I could not make her hear me .
Parsing [sent. 577 len. 21]: She started , turned , seemed to look whence the cry could have come , but kept on her way .
Parsing [sent. 578 len. 14]: Then I shrieked in earnest , and began to run wildly toward her .
Parsing [sent. 579 len. 21]: I think she saw me -- that my quicker change of place detached my shape sufficiently to make it discernible .
Parsing [sent. 580 len. 13]: She pulled up , and sat like a statue , waiting me .
Parsing [sent. 581 len. 28]: I kept on calling as I ran , to assure her I was doing my utmost , for I feared she might grow impatient and leave me .
Parsing [sent. 582 len. 15]: But at last it was slowly indeed I staggered up to her , spent .
Parsing [sent. 583 len. 29]: My foot caught , and as I fell , I clasped the leg of her horse : I had no fear of animals more than of human beings .
Parsing [sent. 584 len. 13]: He was startled , and rearing drew his leg from my arms .
Parsing [sent. 585 len. 11]: But he took care not to come down on me .
Parsing [sent. 586 len. 10]: I rose to my feet , and stood panting .
Parsing [sent. 587 len. 15]: What the lady said , or what I answered , I can not recall .
Parsing [sent. 588 len. 26]: The next thing I remember is stumbling along by her side , for she made her horse walk that I might keep up with her .
Parsing [sent. 589 len. 14]: She talked a little , but I do not remember what she said .
Parsing [sent. 590 len. 11]: It is all a dream now , a far-off one .
Parsing [sent. 591 len. 16]: It must have been like a dream at the time , I was so exhausted .
Parsing [sent. 592 len. 33]: I remember a voice descending now and then , as if from the clouds -- a cold musical voice , with something in it that made me not want to hear it .
Parsing [sent. 593 len. 17]: I remember her saying that we were near her house , and would soon be there .
Parsing [sent. 594 len. 12]: I think she had found out from me where I lived .
Parsing [sent. 595 len. 14]: All the time I never saw her face : it was too dark .
Parsing [sent. 596 len. 11]: I do not think she once spoke kindly to me .
Parsing [sent. 597 len. 19]: She said I had no business to be out alone ; she wondered at my father and mother .
Parsing [sent. 598 len. 16]: I think I was too tired to tell her I had no father or mother .
Parsing [sent. 599 len. 21]: When I did speak , she indicated neither by sound nor movement that she heard or heeded what I said .
Parsing [sent. 600 len. 34]: She sat up above me in the dark , unpleasant , and all but unseen -- a riddle which the troubled child stumbling along by her horse 's side did not want solved .
Parsing [sent. 601 len. 16]: Had there been anything to call light , I should have run away from her .
Parsing [sent. 602 len. 31]: Vague doubts of witches and ogresses crossed my mind , but I said to myself the stories about them were not true , and kept on as best I could .
Parsing [sent. 603 len. 18]: Before we reached the house , we had left the heath , and were moving along lanes .
Parsing [sent. 604 len. 21]: The horse seemed to walk with more confidence , and it was harder for me to keep up with him .
Parsing [sent. 605 len. 12]: I was so tired that I could not feel my legs .
Parsing [sent. 606 len. 13]: I stumbled often , and once the horse trod on my foot .
Parsing [sent. 607 len. 15]: I fell ; he went on ; I had to run limping after him .
Parsing [sent. 608 len. 5]: At last we stopped .
Parsing [sent. 609 len. 5]: I could see nothing .
Parsing [sent. 610 len. 7]: The lady gave a musical cry .
Parsing [sent. 611 len. 19]: A voice and footsteps made answer ; and presently came the sound of a gate on its hinges .
Parsing [sent. 612 len. 8]: A long dark piece of road followed .
Parsing [sent. 613 len. 18]: I knew we were among trees , for I heard the wind in them over our heads .
Parsing [sent. 614 len. 19]: Then I saw lights in windows , and presently we stopped at the door of a great house .
Parsing [sent. 615 len. 8]: I remember nothing more of that night .
Parsing [sent. 616 len. 3]: CHAPTER VII .
Parsing [sent. 617 len. 3]: THE MIRROR .
Parsing [sent. 618 len. 25]: I woke the next morning in a strange bed , and for a long time could not think how I came to be there .
Parsing [sent. 619 len. 14]: A maid appeared , and told me it was time to get up .
Parsing [sent. 620 len. 12]: Greatly to my dislike , she would insist on dressing me .
Parsing [sent. 621 len. 21]: My clothes looked very miserable , I remember , in consequence of what they had gone through the night before .
Parsing [sent. 622 len. 43]: She was kind to me , and asked me a great many questions , but paid no heed to my answers -- a treatment to which I had not been used : I think she must have been the lady 's maid .
Parsing [sent. 623 len. 23]: When I was ready , she took me to the housekeeper 's room , where I had bread and milk for breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 624 len. 21]: Several servants , men and women , came and went , and I thought they all looked at me strangely .
Parsing [sent. 625 len. 11]: I concluded they had no little girls in that house .
Parsing [sent. 626 len. 10]: Assuredly there was small favour for children in it .
Parsing [sent. 627 len. 25]: In some houses the child is as a stranger ; in others he rules : neither such house is in the kingdom of heaven .
Parsing [sent. 628 len. 24]: I must have looked a forlorn creature as I sat , or perched rather , on the old horsehair-sofa in that dingy room .
Parsing [sent. 629 len. 11]: Nobody said more than a word or so to me .
Parsing [sent. 630 len. 24]: I wondered what was going to be done with me , but I had long been able to wait for what would come .
Parsing [sent. 631 len. 46]: At length , after , as it seemed , hours of weary waiting , during which my heart grew sick with longing after my uncle , I was , without a word of explanation , led through long passages into a room which appeared enormous .
Parsing [sent. 632 len. 13]: There I was again left a long while -- this time alone .
Parsing [sent. 633 len. 41]: It was all white and gold , and had its walls nearly covered with great mirrors from floor to ceiling , which , while it was indeed of great size , was the cause of its looking so immeasurably large .
Parsing [sent. 634 len. 18]: But it was some time before I discovered this , for I was not accustomed to mirrors .
Parsing [sent. 635 len. 38]: Except the small one on my little dressing-table , and one still less on Martha 's , I had scarcely seen a mirror , and was not prepared for those sheets of glass in narrow gold frames .
Parsing [sent. 636 len. 24]: I went about , looking at one thing and another , but handling nothing : my late secret had cured me of that .
Parsing [sent. 637 len. 31]: Weary at last , I dropped upon a low chair , and would probably have soon fallen asleep , had not the door opened , and some one come in .
Parsing [sent. 638 len. 18]: I could not see the door without turning , and was too tired and sleepy to move .
Parsing [sent. 639 len. 17]: I sat still , staring , hardly conscious , into the mirror in front of me .
Parsing [sent. 640 len. 31]: All at once I descried in it my uncle -- but only to see him grow white as death , and turn away , reeling as if he would fall .
Parsing [sent. 641 len. 18]: The sight so bewildered me that , instead of rushing to embrace him , I sat frozen .
Parsing [sent. 642 len. 23]: He clapped his hands to his eyes , steadied himself , stood for a moment rigid , then came straight toward me .
Parsing [sent. 643 len. 24]: But , to my added astonishment , he gave me no greeting , or showed any sign of joy at having found me .
Parsing [sent. 644 len. 50]: Never before had he seen me for the first time any day , without giving me a kiss ; never before , it seemed to me , had he spoken to me without a smile : I had been lost and was found , and he was not glad !
Parsing [sent. 645 len. 11]: The strange reception fell on me like a numbing spell .
Parsing [sent. 646 len. 18]: I had nothing to say , no impulse to move , no part in the present world .
Parsing [sent. 647 len. 40]: He caught me up in his arms , hid his face upon me , knocked his shoulder heavily against the door-post as he went from the room , walked straight through the hall , and out of the house .
Parsing [sent. 648 len. 20]: I think no one saw us as we went ; I am sure neither of us saw any one .
Parsing [sent. 649 len. 14]: With long strides he walked down the avenue , never turning his head .
Parsing [sent. 650 len. 19]: Not until we were on the moor , out of sight of the house , did he stop .
Parsing [sent. 651 len. 19]: Then he set me down ; and then first we discovered that he had left his hat behind .
Parsing [sent. 652 len. 28]: For all his carrying of me , and going so fast -- and I must have been rather heavy -- his face had no colour in it .
Parsing [sent. 653 len. 11]: `` Shall I run and get it , uncle ? ''
Parsing [sent. 654 len. 23]: I said , as I saw him raise his hand to his head and find no hat there to be taken off .
Parsing [sent. 655 len. 10]: `` I should be back in a minute ! ''
Parsing [sent. 656 len. 9]: It was the first word spoken between us .
Parsing [sent. 657 len. 41]: `` No , my little one , '' he answered , wiping his forehead : his voice sounded far away , like that of one speaking in a dream ; `` I ca n't let you out of my sight .
Parsing [sent. 658 len. 13]: I 've been wandering the moor all night looking for you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 659 len. 32]: With that he caught me up again , and pressing his face to mine , walked with me thus , for a long quarter of a mile , I should think .
Parsing [sent. 660 len. 6]: Oh how safe I felt !
Parsing [sent. 661 len. 5]: -- and how happy !
Parsing [sent. 662 len. 5]: -- happy beyond smiling !
Parsing [sent. 663 len. 21]: I loved him before , but I never knew before what it was to lose him and find him again .
Parsing [sent. 664 len. 10]: `` Tell me , '' he said at length .
Parsing [sent. 665 len. 18]: I told him all , and he did not speak a word until my tale was finished .
Parsing [sent. 666 len. 27]: `` Were you very frightened , '' he then asked , `` when you found you had lost your way , and darkness was coming ? ''
Parsing [sent. 667 len. 15]: `` I was frightened , or I would not have gone to the lady .
Parsing [sent. 668 len. 15]: But I wish I had staid on the moor for you to find me .
Parsing [sent. 669 len. 11]: I knew you would soon be out looking for me .
Parsing [sent. 670 len. 27]: Until she came I comforted myself with thinking that perhaps even then you were on the moor , and I might see you any moment . ''
Parsing [sent. 671 len. 9]: `` What else did you think of ? ''
Parsing [sent. 672 len. 25]: `` I thought that God was out on the moor , and if you were not there , he would keep me company . ''
Parsing [sent. 673 len. 4]: `` Ah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 674 len. 24]: said my uncle , as if thinking to himself ; `` she but needs him the more when I am with her ! ''
Parsing [sent. 675 len. 7]: `` Yes , of course ! ''
Parsing [sent. 676 len. 17]: I answered ; `` I need him then for you as well as for myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 677 len. 9]: `` That is very true , my child !
Parsing [sent. 678 len. 16]: -- Shall I tell you one thing I thought of while looking for you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 679 len. 6]: `` Please , uncle . ''
Parsing [sent. 680 len. 20]: `` I thought how Jesus ' father and mother must have felt when they were looking for him . ''
Parsing [sent. 681 len. 21]: `` And they need n't have been so unhappy if they had thought who he was -- need they ? ''
Parsing [sent. 682 len. 4]: `` Certainly not .
Parsing [sent. 683 len. 16]: And I need n't have been so unhappy if I had thought who you were .
Parsing [sent. 684 len. 13]: But I was terribly frightened , and there I was wrong . ''
Parsing [sent. 685 len. 8]: `` Who am I , uncle ? ''
Parsing [sent. 686 len. 12]: `` Another little one of the same father as he . ''
Parsing [sent. 687 len. 9]: `` Why were you frightened , uncle ? ''
Parsing [sent. 688 len. 10]: `` I was afraid of your being frightened . ''
Parsing [sent. 689 len. 14]: `` I hardly had time to be frightened before the lady came . ''
Parsing [sent. 690 len. 14]: `` Yes ; you see I need n't have been so unhappy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 691 len. 13]: My uncle always treated me as if I could understand him perfectly .
Parsing [sent. 692 len. 21]: This came , I see now , from the essential childlikeness of his nature , and from no educational theory .
Parsing [sent. 693 len. 31]: `` Sometimes , '' he went on , `` I look all around me to see if Jesus is out anywhere , but I have never seen him yet ! ''
Parsing [sent. 694 len. 13]: `` We shall see him one day , sha n't we ? ''
Parsing [sent. 695 len. 17]: I said , craning round to look into his eyes , which were my earthly paradise .
Parsing [sent. 696 len. 37]: Nor are they a whit less dear to me , nay , they are dearer , that he has been in God 's somewhere , that is , the heavenly paradise , for many a year .
Parsing [sent. 697 len. 35]: `` I think so , '' he answered , with a sigh that seemed to swell like a sea-wave against me , as I sat on his arm ; '' -- I hope so .
Parsing [sent. 698 len. 13]: I live but for that -- and for one thing more . ''
Parsing [sent. 699 len. 31]: There are some , I fancy , who would blame him for not being sure , and bring text after text to prove that he ought to have been sure .
Parsing [sent. 700 len. 5]: But oh those text-people !
Parsing [sent. 701 len. 25]: They look to me , not like the clay-sparrows that Jesus made fly , but like bird-skins in a glass-case , stuffed with texts .
Parsing [sent. 702 len. 18]: The doubt of a man like my uncle must be a far better thing than their assurance !
Parsing [sent. 703 len. 21]: `` Would you have been frightened if you had met him on the moor last night , little one ? ''
Parsing [sent. 704 len. 7]: he asked , after a pause .
Parsing [sent. 705 len. 8]: `` Oh , no , uncle ! ''
Parsing [sent. 706 len. 3]: I returned .
Parsing [sent. 707 len. 23]: `` I should have thought it was you till I came nearer , and then I should have known who it was !
Parsing [sent. 708 len. 19]: He would n't like a big girl like me to be frightened at him -- would he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 709 len. 6]: `` Indeed not ! ' ''
Parsing [sent. 710 len. 22]: answered my uncle fervently ; but again his words brought with them a great sigh , and he said no more .
Parsing [sent. 711 len. 25]: When we reached home , he gave me up to Martha , and went out again -- nor returned before I was in bed .
Parsing [sent. 712 len. 22]: But he came to my room , and waked me with a kiss , which sent me faster asleep than before .
Parsing [sent. 713 len. 3]: CHAPTER VIII .
Parsing [sent. 714 len. 20]: THANATOS AND ZOE I think it must have been soon after this that my uncle bought himself a horse .
Parsing [sent. 715 len. 48]: I know something of horses now -- that is , if much riding and much love suffice to give a knowledge of them -- and the horse which was a glory and a wonder to me then , is a glory and a wonder to me still .
Parsing [sent. 716 len. 26]: He was large , big-boned , and powerful , with less beauty but more grandeur than a thoroughbred , and full of a fiery gentleness .
Parsing [sent. 717 len. 10]: He was the very horse for sir Philip Sidney !
Parsing [sent. 718 len. 47]: One day , after he had had him for several months , and had let no one saddle him but himself , therefore knew him perfectly , and knew that the horse knew his master , I happened to be in the yard as he mounted .
Parsing [sent. 719 len. 20]: The moment he was in the saddle , he bent down to me , and held out his hand .
Parsing [sent. 720 len. 12]: `` Come with me , little one , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 721 len. 13]: Almost ere I knew , I was in the saddle before him .
Parsing [sent. 722 len. 19]: I grasped his hand , instinctively caught with my foot at his , and was astride the pommel .
Parsing [sent. 723 len. 32]: I will not say I sat very comfortably , but the memory of that day 's delight will never leave me -- not `` through all the secular to be . ''
Parsing [sent. 724 len. 25]: There must be a God to the world that could give any such delight as fell then to the share of one little girl !
Parsing [sent. 725 len. 36]: I think my uncle must soon after have got another saddle , for I have no recollection of any more discomfort ; I remember only the delight of the motion of the horse under me .
Parsing [sent. 726 len. 25]: For , after this , I rode with him often , and he taught me to ride as surely not many have been taught .
Parsing [sent. 727 len. 28]: When he saw me so at home in my seat as to require no support , he made me change my position , and go behind him .
Parsing [sent. 728 len. 18]: There I sat sideways on a cloth , like a lady of old time on a pillion .
Parsing [sent. 729 len. 62]: When I had got used to this , my uncle made me stand on the horse 's broad back , holding on by his shoulders ; and it was wonderful how soon , and how unconsciously , I accommodated myself to every motion of the strength that bore me , learning to keep my place by pure balance like a rope-dancer .
Parsing [sent. 730 len. 43]: I had soon quite forgotten to hold by my uncle , and without the least support rode as comfortably , and with as much confidence , as any rider in a circus , though with a far less easy pace under me .
Parsing [sent. 731 len. 21]: When my uncle found me capable of this , he was much pleased , though a little nervous at times .
Parsing [sent. 732 len. 25]: Able now to ride his big horse any way , he brought me one afternoon the loveliest of Shetland ponies , not very small .
Parsing [sent. 733 len. 18]: With the ordinary human distrust in good , I could hardly believe she was meant for me .
Parsing [sent. 734 len. 19]: She was a dappled gray -- like the twilight of a morning after rain , my uncle said .
Parsing [sent. 735 len. 9]: He called her Zoe , which means Life .
Parsing [sent. 736 len. 11]: His own horse he called Thanatos , which means Death .
Parsing [sent. 737 len. 15]: Such as understood it , thought it a terrible name to give a horse .
Parsing [sent. 738 len. 17]: For most people are so afraid of Death that they regard his very name with awe .
Parsing [sent. 739 len. 25]: My uncle had a riding-habit made for me , and after a week found I could give him no more trouble with my horsewomanship .
Parsing [sent. 740 len. 33]: At once I was at home on my new friend 's back , with vistas of delight innumerable opening around me , and from that day my uncle seldom rode without me .
Parsing [sent. 741 len. 23]: When he went wandering , it was almost always on foot , and then , as before , he was always alone .
Parsing [sent. 742 len. 18]: The idea of offering to accompany him on such an occasion , had never occurred to me .
Parsing [sent. 743 len. 43]: But one stormy autumn afternoon -- most of my memories seem of the autumn -- my uncle looked worse than usual when he went out , and I felt , I think for the first time , a vague uneasiness about him .
Parsing [sent. 744 len. 28]: Perhaps I had been thinking of him more ; perhaps I had begun to wonder what the secret could be that made him so often seem unhappy .
Parsing [sent. 745 len. 17]: Anyhow this evening the desire awoke to be with him in his trouble whatever it was .
Parsing [sent. 746 len. 25]: There was no curiosity in the feeling , I think , only the desire to serve him as I had never served him yet .
Parsing [sent. 747 len. 30]: I had been , as long as I could remember , always at his beck or lightest call ; now I wanted to come when needed without being called .
Parsing [sent. 748 len. 15]: Was it impossible a girl should do anything for a man in his trouble ?
Parsing [sent. 749 len. 28]: He , a great man , had helped a little girl out of the deepest despair ; could the little girl do nothing for the great man ?
Parsing [sent. 750 len. 13]: That the big people should do everything , did not seem fair !
Parsing [sent. 751 len. 37]: He had told me once that the world was held together by what every one could do that the others could not do : there must be something I could do that he could not do !
Parsing [sent. 752 len. 16]: The rain was coming down on the roof like the steady tramp of distant squadrons .
Parsing [sent. 753 len. 22]: I was in the study , therefore near the tiles , and that was how the rain always sounded upon them .
Parsing [sent. 754 len. 24]: Tramp , tramp , tramp , came the whole army of things , riding , riding , to befall my uncle and me .
Parsing [sent. 755 len. 19]: Tramp , tramp , came the troops of the future , to take the citadel of the present !
Parsing [sent. 756 len. 14]: I was not afraid of them , neither sought to imagine myself afraid !
Parsing [sent. 757 len. 15]: I had no picture in my mind of any evil that could assail me .
Parsing [sent. 758 len. 20]: A little grove of black poplars under the gable-window , kept swaying their expostulations , and moaning their entreaties .
Parsing [sent. 759 len. 26]: The great rushing blasts of the wind through their rooted resistance , made the music of the band that accompanied the march of the unknown .
Parsing [sent. 760 len. 16]: I sat and listened , with the vague conviction that something was being done somewhere .
Parsing [sent. 761 len. 22]: It could not be that only the wind and the trees and the rain were in all that wailing and marching !
Parsing [sent. 762 len. 12]: The Powers of life and death must somewhere be at work !
Parsing [sent. 763 len. 23]: Then rose before me the face of my uncle , as he walked from the room , haloed in a sorrowful stillness .
Parsing [sent. 764 len. 8]: If only I could be with him !
Parsing [sent. 765 len. 9]: If only I knew where to seek him !
Parsing [sent. 766 len. 15]: Wishing , wishing , I sat and listened to the rain and the wind .
Parsing [sent. 767 len. 13]: Suddenly I found myself on my feet , making for the door .
Parsing [sent. 768 len. 47]: I would not have ventured alone upon the moor in such a night , but I should have Zoe with me , who knew all the ways of it -- had doubtless been used to bogs in her own country , and her mother before her !
Parsing [sent. 769 len. 47]: Like a small elephant , she would put out her little foot , and tap , and sound , to see if the surface would bear her -- if the questionable spot was what it looked to her mistress , or what she herself doubted it .
Parsing [sent. 770 len. 35]: When she had once made up her mind in the negative , no foolish attempt of mine could overpersuade her -- could make her trust our weight on it a hair 's - breadth .
Parsing [sent. 771 len. 29]: In a bog the greenest spots are the most dangerous , and Zoe knew it : the matted roots might be afloat on a fathomless depth of water .
Parsing [sent. 772 len. 23]: Backed by my uncle , she soon taught me to be as much afraid of those green spots as she was herself .
Parsing [sent. 773 len. 8]: I had learned to trust her thoroughly .
Parsing [sent. 774 len. 60]: I took my way to the stable , with a hug and a kiss to Martha as I passed her in the kitchen , I got the cowboy to saddle Zoe , fearing I might not persuade one of the big men on such a night , and I was not quite able myself to tighten the girths properly .
Parsing [sent. 775 len. 22]: She had not been out all day , and when I mounted , she danced at the prospect of a gallop .
Parsing [sent. 776 len. 40]: I took with me the little lantern I went about the place with when there was no moon , and with this alight in my hand , we darted off at a tight-reined gallop into the wet blowing night .
Parsing [sent. 777 len. 16]: What I was going for I did not know , beyond being with my uncle .
Parsing [sent. 778 len. 34]: So far was I from any fear , that , but for my shadowy uneasiness about him , I should have been filled full of the wild joy of battle with the elements .
Parsing [sent. 779 len. 44]: The first part of the way , I had to cling to the saddle : not otherwise could I keep my seat against the wind , which blew so fiercely on me sideways , that it threatened to blow me out of it .
Parsing [sent. 780 len. 22]: I had not gone far before the saddle began to turn round with me ; I was slipping to the ground .
Parsing [sent. 781 len. 27]: I pulled up , dismounted , undid the girths with difficulty , set the saddle straight , then pulled at every strap with all my might .
Parsing [sent. 782 len. 18]: It was to no purpose : I could not get another hole out of one of them .
Parsing [sent. 783 len. 21]: I mounted and set off again ; but the moment a stronger blast came , the saddle began to turn .
Parsing [sent. 784 len. 20]: Then I thought of something to try : dismounting once more , I got up on the off side .
Parsing [sent. 785 len. 46]: The wind now pushed me on to the saddle , freeing it from my leverage , while I had , besides , the use of my legs against the wind , so that we got on bravely , my Zoe and I. But , alas !
Parsing [sent. 786 len. 31]: my lantern was out , and it was impossible to light it again , so that I had now no arrow to shoot at random for my uncle 's eye .
Parsing [sent. 787 len. 35]: Before long we reached a tolerable cart-track , which led across the waste to a village , and the wind being now behind us , I resumed the more comfortable seat in the saddle .
Parsing [sent. 788 len. 39]: We were going at a good speed , and had ridden , as I judged , about three miles , when there came a great flash of lightning -- not like any flash I had ever seen before .
Parsing [sent. 789 len. 74]: It was neither the reflection of lightning below the horizon , nor the sudden zigzagged blade , the very idea of force without weight ; it was the burst of a ball-headed torrent of fire from a dark cloud , like water sudden from a mountain 's heart , which went rushing down a rugged channel , as if the cloud were indeed a mountain , and the fire one of its cataracts .
Parsing [sent. 790 len. 49]: Its endurance was momentary , but its moments might have been counted , for it lasted appreciably longer than an ordinary flash , revealing to my eyes what remains on my mind clear as the picture of some neighbouring tree on the skin of one slain by lightning .
Parsing [sent. 791 len. 42]: The torrent tumbled down the cloud and vanished , but left with me the vision of a man , plainly my uncle , a few hundred yards from me , on a gigantic gray horse , which reared high with fright .
Parsing [sent. 792 len. 40]: But for its size I could have testified before a magistrate , that I had not only seen that horse in the stable as my pony was being saddled , but had stroked and kissed him on the nose .
Parsing [sent. 793 len. 43]: I conceived at once that his apparent size was an illusion caused by the suddenness and keenness of the light , and that my uncle had come home before I had well reached the moor , and had ridden out after me .
Parsing [sent. 794 len. 19]: With a wild cry of delight , I turned at once to leave the road and join him .
Parsing [sent. 795 len. 16]: But the thunder that moment burst with a terrific bellow , and swallowed my cry .
Parsing [sent. 796 len. 24]: The same instant , however , came through it from the other side the voice of my uncle only a few yards away .
Parsing [sent. 797 len. 16]: `` Stay , little one , '' he shouted ; `` stay where you are .
Parsing [sent. 798 len. 10]: I will be with you in a moment . ''
Parsing [sent. 799 len. 41]: I obeyed , as ever and always without a thought I obeyed the slightest word of my uncle : Zoe and I stood as if never yet parted from chaos and the dark , for Zoe too loved his voice .
Parsing [sent. 800 len. 56]: The wind rose suddenly from a lull to a great roar , emptying a huge cloudful of rain upon us , so that I heard no sound of my uncle 's approach ; but presently out of the dark an arm was around me , and my head was lying on my uncle 's bosom .
Parsing [sent. 801 len. 15]: Then the dark and the rain seemed the natural elements for love and confidence .
Parsing [sent. 802 len. 27]: `` But , uncle , '' I murmured , full of wonder which had had no time to take shape , `` how is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 803 len. 29]: He answered in a whisper that seemed to dread the ear of the wind , lest it should hear him -- `` You saw , did you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 804 len. 15]: `` I saw you upon Death away there in the middle of the lightning .
Parsing [sent. 805 len. 6]: I was going to you .
Parsing [sent. 806 len. 9]: I do n't know what to think . ''
Parsing [sent. 807 len. 13]: My uncle and I often called the horse by his English name .
Parsing [sent. 808 len. 21]: `` Neither do I , '' he returned , with a strange half voice , as if he were choking .
Parsing [sent. 809 len. 12]: `` It must have been -- I do n't know what .
Parsing [sent. 810 len. 9]: There is a deep bog away just there .
Parsing [sent. 811 len. 9]: It must be a lake by now ! ''
Parsing [sent. 812 len. 10]: `` Yes , uncle ; I might have remembered !
Parsing [sent. 813 len. 20]: But how was I to think of that when I saw you there -- on dear old Death too !
Parsing [sent. 814 len. 21]: He 's the last of horses to get into a bog : he knows his own weight too well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 815 len. 12]: `` But why did you come out on such a night ?
Parsing [sent. 816 len. 12]: What possessed you , little one -- in such a storm ?
Parsing [sent. 817 len. 12]: I begin to be afraid what next you may do . ''
Parsing [sent. 818 len. 21]: `` I never do anything -- now -- that I think you would mind me doing , '' I answered .
Parsing [sent. 819 len. 27]: `` But if you will write out a little book of _ mays _ and _ maynots _ , I will learn it by heart . ''
Parsing [sent. 820 len. 22]: `` No , no , '' he returned ; `` we are not going back to the tables of the law !
Parsing [sent. 821 len. 19]: You have a better law written in your heart , my child ; I will trust to that .
Parsing [sent. 822 len. 20]: -- But tell me why you came out on such a night -- and as dark as pitch . ''
Parsing [sent. 823 len. 22]: `` Just because it was such a night , uncle , and you were out in it , '' I answered .
Parsing [sent. 824 len. 9]: `` Ai n't I your own little girl ?
Parsing [sent. 825 len. 11]: I hope you ai n't sorry I came , uncle !
Parsing [sent. 826 len. 20]: I am glad ; and I should n't like ever to be glad at what made you sorry . ''
Parsing [sent. 827 len. 8]: `` What are you glad of ? ''
Parsing [sent. 828 len. 11]: `` That I came -- because I 've found you .
Parsing [sent. 829 len. 8]: I came to look for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 830 len. 13]: `` Why did you come to-night more than any other night ? ''
Parsing [sent. 831 len. 10]: `` Because I wanted so much to see you .
Parsing [sent. 832 len. 11]: I thought I might be of use to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 833 len. 20]: `` You are always of use to me ; but why did you think of it just to-night ? ''
Parsing [sent. 834 len. 6]: `` I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 835 len. 14]: -- I am older than I was last night , '' I replied .
Parsing [sent. 836 len. 13]: He seemed to understand me , and asked me no more questions .
Parsing [sent. 837 len. 13]: All the time , we had been standing still in the storm .
Parsing [sent. 838 len. 11]: He took Zoe 's head and turned it toward home .
Parsing [sent. 839 len. 17]: The dear creature set out with slow leisurely step , heedless apparently of storm and stable .
Parsing [sent. 840 len. 15]: She knew who was by her side , and he must set the pace !
Parsing [sent. 841 len. 14]: As we went my uncle seemed lost in thought -- and no wonder !
Parsing [sent. 842 len. 12]: for how could the sight we had seen be accounted for !
Parsing [sent. 843 len. 6]: Or what might it indicate ?
Parsing [sent. 844 len. 21]: Many were the strange tales I had read , and my conviction was that the vision belonged to the inexplicable .
Parsing [sent. 845 len. 13]: It grew upon me that I had seen my uncle 's double .
Parsing [sent. 846 len. 46]: That he should see his own double would not in itself have much surprised me -- or , indeed , that I should see it ; but I had never read of another person seeing a double at the same time with the person doubled .
Parsing [sent. 847 len. 31]: During the next few days I sought hard for some possible explanation of what had occurred , but could find nothing parallel to it within the scope of my knowledge .
Parsing [sent. 848 len. 35]: I tried _ fata morgana , mirage , parhelion _ , and whatever I had learned of recognized illusion , but in vain sought satisfaction , or anything pointing in the direction of satisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 849 len. 9]: I was compelled to leave the thing alone .
Parsing [sent. 850 len. 15]: My uncle kept silence about it , but seemed to brood more than usual .
Parsing [sent. 851 len. 19]: I think he too was convinced that it must have another explanation than present science would afford him .
Parsing [sent. 852 len. 29]: Once I ventured to ask if he had come to any conclusion ; with a sad smile , he answered , `` I am waiting , little one .
Parsing [sent. 853 len. 9]: There is much we have to wait for .
Parsing [sent. 854 len. 13]: Where would be the good of having your mind made up wrong ?
Parsing [sent. 855 len. 14]: It only stands in the way of getting it made up right ! ''
Parsing [sent. 856 len. 17]: By degrees the thing went into the distance , and I ceased even speculating upon it .
Parsing [sent. 857 len. 70]: But one little fact I may mention ere I leave it -- that , just as I was reaching a state of quiet mental prorogation , I suddenly remembered that , the moment after the flash , my Zoe , startled as she was , gave out a low whinny ; I remembered the quiver of it under me : she too must have seen her master 's double !
Parsing [sent. 858 len. 3]: CHAPTER IX .
Parsing [sent. 859 len. 3]: THE GARDEN .
Parsing [sent. 860 len. 18]: I remember nothing more to disturb the even flow of my life till I was nearly seventeen .
Parsing [sent. 861 len. 16]: Many pleasant things had come and gone ; many pleasant things kept coming and going .
Parsing [sent. 862 len. 23]: I had studied tolerably well -- at least my uncle showed himself pleased with the progress I had made and was making .
Parsing [sent. 863 len. 20]: I know even yet a good deal more than would be required for one of these modern degrees feminine .
Parsing [sent. 864 len. 22]: I had besides read more of the older literature of my country than any one I have met except my uncle .
Parsing [sent. 865 len. 47]: I had also this advantage over most students , that my knowledge was gained without the slightest prick of the spur of emulation -- purely in following the same delight in myself that shone radiant in the eyes of my uncle as he read with me .
Parsing [sent. 866 len. 49]: I had this advantage also over many , that , perhaps from impression of the higher mind , I saw and learned a thing not merely as a fact whose glory lay in the mystery of its undeveloped harmonics , but as the harbinger of an unknown advent .
Parsing [sent. 867 len. 21]: For as long as I can remember , my heart was given to expectation , was tuned to long waiting .
Parsing [sent. 868 len. 13]: I constantly felt -- felt without thinking -- that something was coming .
Parsing [sent. 869 len. 5]: I feel it now .
Parsing [sent. 870 len. 9]: Were I young I dared not say so .
Parsing [sent. 871 len. 17]: How could I , compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses to the common-place !
Parsing [sent. 872 len. 66]: Do I not see their superior smile , as , with voices sweetly acidulous , they quote in reply -- `` Love is well on the way ; He 'll be here to-day , Or , at latest , the end of the week ; Too soon you will find him , And the sorrow behind him You will not go out to seek ! ''
Parsing [sent. 873 len. 77]: Would they not tell me that such expectation was but the shadow of the cloud called love , hanging no bigger than a man 's hand on the far horizon , but fraught with storm for mind and soul , which , when it withdrew , would carry with it the glow and the glory and the hope of life ; being at best but the mirage of an unattainable paradise , therefore direst of deceptions !
Parsing [sent. 874 len. 21]: Little do such suspect that their own behaviour has withered their faith , and their unbelief dried up their life .
Parsing [sent. 875 len. 27]: They can now no more believe in what they once felt , than a cloud can believe in the rainbow it once bore on its bosom .
Parsing [sent. 876 len. 26]: But I am old , therefore dare to say that I expect more and better and higher and lovelier things than I have ever had .
Parsing [sent. 877 len. 27]: I am not going home to God to say -- `` Father , I have imagined more beautiful things than thou art able to make true !
Parsing [sent. 878 len. 24]: They were so good that thou thyself art either not good enough to will them , or not strong enough to make them .
Parsing [sent. 879 len. 20]: Thou couldst but make thy creature dream of them , because thou canst but dream of them thyself . ''
Parsing [sent. 880 len. 4]: Nay , nay !
Parsing [sent. 881 len. 38]: In the faith of him to whom the Father shows all things he does , I expect lovelier gifts than I ever have been , ever shall be able to dream of asleep , or imagine awake .
Parsing [sent. 882 len. 9]: I was now approaching the verge of woman-hood .
Parsing [sent. 883 len. 33]: What lay beyond it I could ill descry , though surely a vague power of undeveloped prophecy dwells in every created thing -- even in the bird ere he chips his shell .
Parsing [sent. 884 len. 63]: Should I dare , or could I endure to write of what lies now to my hand , if I did not believe that not our worst but our best moments , not our low but our lofty moods , not our times logical and scientific , but our times instinctive and imaginative , are those in which we perceive the truth !
Parsing [sent. 885 len. 14]: In them we behold it with a beholding which is one with believing .
Parsing [sent. 886 len. 40]: And , `` Though nothing can bring back the hour Of splendour in the grass , of glory in the flower '' , could not Wordsworth , and can not we , call up the vision of that hour ?
Parsing [sent. 887 len. 17]: and has not its memory almost , or even altogether , the potency of its presence ?
Parsing [sent. 888 len. 29]: Is not the very thought of any certain flower enough to make me believe in that flower -- believe it to mean all it ever seemed to mean ?
Parsing [sent. 889 len. 23]: That _ these _ eyes may never more rest upon it with the old delight , means little , and matters nothing .
Parsing [sent. 890 len. 11]: I have other eyes , and shall have yet others .
Parsing [sent. 891 len. 54]: If I thought , as so many have degraded themselves to think , that the glory of things in the morning of love was a glamour cast upon the world , no outshine of indwelling radiance , should I care to breathe one day more the air of this or of any world ?
Parsing [sent. 892 len. 46]: Nay , nay , but there dwells in everything the Father hath made , the fire of the burning bush , as at home in his son dwelt the glory that , set free , broke out from him on the mount of his transfiguration .
Parsing [sent. 893 len. 106]: The happy-making vision of things that floods the gaze of the youth , when first he lives in the marvel of loving , and being loved by , a woman , is the true vision -- and the more likely to be the true one , that , when he gives way to selfishness , he loses faith in the vision , and sinks back into the commonplace unfaith of the beggarly world -- a disappointed , sneering worshipper of power and money -- with this remnant of the light yet in him , that he grumbles at the gloom its departure has left behind .
Parsing [sent. 894 len. 31]: He confesses by his soreness that the illusion ought to have been true ; he seldom confesses that he loved himself more than the woman , and so lost her .
Parsing [sent. 895 len. 45]: He lays the blame on God , on the woman , on the soullessness of the universe -- anywhere but on the one being in which he is interested enough to be sure it exists -- his own precious , greedy , vulgar self .
Parsing [sent. 896 len. 24]: Would I dare to write of love , if I did not believe it a true , that is , an eternal thing !
Parsing [sent. 897 len. 24]: It was a summer of exceptional splendour in which my eyes were opened to `` the glory of the sum of things . ''
Parsing [sent. 898 len. 48]: It was not so hot of the sun as summers I have known , but there were so many gentle and loving winds about , with never point or knife-edge in them , that it seemed all the housework of the universe was being done by ladies .
Parsing [sent. 899 len. 13]: Then the way the odours went and came on those sweet winds !
Parsing [sent. 900 len. 11]: and the way the twilight fell asleep into the dark !
Parsing [sent. 901 len. 25]: and the way the sun rushed up in the morning , as if he cried , like a boy , `` Here I am !
Parsing [sent. 902 len. 6]: The Father has sent me !
Parsing [sent. 903 len. 6]: Is n't it jolly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 904 len. 13]: I saw more sun-rises that year than any year before or since .
Parsing [sent. 905 len. 9]: And the grass was so thick and soft !
Parsing [sent. 906 len. 7]: There must be grass in heaven !
Parsing [sent. 907 len. 16]: And the roses , both wild and tame , that grew together in the wilderness !
Parsing [sent. 908 len. 12]: -- I think you would like to hear about the wilderness .
Parsing [sent. 909 len. 24]: When I grew to notice , and think , and put things together , I began to wonder how the wilderness came there .
Parsing [sent. 910 len. 59]: I could understand that the solemn garden , with its great yew-hedges and alleys , and its oddly cut box-trees , was a survival of the stately old gardens haunted by ruffs and farthingales ; but the wilderness looked so much younger that I was perplexed with it , especially as I saw nothing like it anywhere else .
Parsing [sent. 911 len. 39]: I asked my uncle about it , and he explained that it was indeed after an old fashion , but that he had himself made the wilderness , mostly with his own hands , when he was young .
Parsing [sent. 912 len. 38]: This surprised me , for I had never seen him touch a spade , and hardly ever saw him in the garden : when I did , I always felt as if something was going to happen .
Parsing [sent. 913 len. 22]: He said he had in it tried to copy the wilderness laid out by lord St. Alban 's in his essays .
Parsing [sent. 914 len. 15]: I found the volume , and soon came upon the essay , On Gardens .
Parsing [sent. 915 len. 41]: The passage concerning the wilderness , gave me , and still gives me so much delight , that I will transplant it like a rose-bush into this wilderness of mine , hoping it will give like pleasure to my reader .
Parsing [sent. 916 len. 32]: `` For the heath , which was the third part of our plot , I wish it to be framed , as much as may be , to a natural wildness .
Parsing [sent. 917 len. 38]: Trees I would have none in it ; but some thickets , made only of sweetbriar , and honnysuckle , and some wild vine amongst ; and the ground set with violets , strawberries , and primroses .
Parsing [sent. 918 len. 11]: For these are sweet , and prosper in the shade .
Parsing [sent. 919 len. 16]: And these to be in the heath , here and there not in any order .
Parsing [sent. 920 len. 96]: I like also little heapes , in the nature of mole-hills -LRB- such as are in wild heaths -RRB- to be set , some with wild thyme ; some with pincks ; some with germander , that gives a good flower to the eye ; some with periwinkle ; some with violets ; some with strawberries ; some with couslips ; some with daisies ; some with red roses ; some with lilium convallium ; some with sweet-williams red ; some with beares-foot ; and the like low flowers , being withall sweet and sightly .
Parsing [sent. 921 len. 23]: Part of which heapes , to be with standards , of little bushes , prickt upon their top , and part without .
Parsing [sent. 922 len. 40]: The standards to be roses ; juniper ; holly ; beareberries -LRB- but here and there , because of the smell of their blossom ;-RRB- red currans ; gooseberries ; rosemary ; bayes ; sweetbriar ; and such like .
Parsing [sent. 923 len. 19]: But these standards , to be kept with cutting , that they grow not out of course . ''
Parsing [sent. 924 len. 46]: Just such , in all but the gooseberries and currants , was the wilderness of our garden : you came on it by a sudden labyrinthine twist at the end of a narrow alley of yew , and a sudden door in the high wall .
Parsing [sent. 925 len. 25]: My uncle said he liked well to see roses in the kitchen-garden , but not gooseberries in the flower-garden , especially a wild flower-garden .
Parsing [sent. 926 len. 17]: Wherein lies the difference , I never quite made out , but I feel a difference .
Parsing [sent. 927 len. 20]: My main delight in the wilderness was to see the roses among the heather -- particularly the wild roses .
Parsing [sent. 928 len. 26]: When I was grown up , the wilderness always affected me like one of Blake 's , or one of Beddoes 's yet wilder lyrics .
Parsing [sent. 929 len. 31]: To make it , my uncle had taken in a part of the heath , which came close up to the garden , leaving plenty of the heather and ling .
Parsing [sent. 930 len. 55]: The protecting fence enclosed a good bit of the heath just as it was , so that the wilderness melted away into the heath , and into the wide moor -- the fence , though contrived so as to be difficult to cross , being so low that one had to look for it .
Parsing [sent. 931 len. 33]: Everywhere the inner garden was surrounded with brick walls , and hedges of yew within them ; but immediately behind the house , the wall to the lane was not very high .
Parsing [sent. 932 len. 3]: CHAPTER X .
Parsing [sent. 933 len. 5]: ONCE MORE A SECRET .
Parsing [sent. 934 len. 22]: One day in June I had gone into the garden about one o'clock , whether with or without object I forget .
Parsing [sent. 935 len. 10]: I had just seen my uncle start for Wittenage .
Parsing [sent. 936 len. 21]: Hearing a horse 's hoofs in the lane that ran along the outside of the wall , I looked up .
Parsing [sent. 937 len. 42]: The same moment the horse stopped , and the face of his rider appeared over the wall , between two stems of yew , and two great flowers of purple lilac , in shape like two perfect bunches of swarming bees .
Parsing [sent. 938 len. 18]: It was the face of a youth of eighteen , and beautiful with a right manly beauty .
Parsing [sent. 939 len. 38]: The moment I looked on this face , I fell into a sort of trance -- that is , I entered for a moment some condition of existence beyond the ramparts of what commonly we call life .
Parsing [sent. 940 len. 12]: Love at first sight it was that initiated the strange experience .
Parsing [sent. 941 len. 22]: But understand me : real as what immediately followed was to the consciousness , there was no actual fact in it .
Parsing [sent. 942 len. 4]: I stood gazing .
Parsing [sent. 943 len. 13]: My eyes seemed drawn , and drawing my person toward the vision .
Parsing [sent. 944 len. 22]: Isolate over the garden-wall was the face ; the rest of the man and all the horse were hidden behind it .
Parsing [sent. 945 len. 25]: Betwixt the yew stems and the two great lilac flowers -- how heart and brain are yet filled with the old scent of them !
Parsing [sent. 946 len. 12]: -- my face , my mouth , my lips met his .
Parsing [sent. 947 len. 12]: I grew blind as with all my heart I kissed him .
Parsing [sent. 948 len. 20]: Then came a flash of icy terror , and a shudder which it frights me even now to recall .
Parsing [sent. 949 len. 28]: Instantly I knew that but a moment had passed , and that I had not moved an inch from the spot where first my eyes met his .
Parsing [sent. 950 len. 15]: But my eyes yet rested on his ; I could not draw them away .
Parsing [sent. 951 len. 6]: I could not free myself .
Parsing [sent. 952 len. 5]: Helplessness was growing agony .
Parsing [sent. 953 len. 6]: His voice broke the spell .
Parsing [sent. 954 len. 18]: He lifted his hunting-cap , and begged me to tell him the way to the next village .
Parsing [sent. 955 len. 17]: My self-possession returned , and the joy of its restoration drove from me any lingering embarrassment .
Parsing [sent. 956 len. 18]: I went forward , and without a faltering tone , I believe , gave him detailed directions .
Parsing [sent. 957 len. 30]: He told me afterwards that , himself in a state of bewildered surprise , he thought me the coolest young person he had ever had the fortune to meet .
Parsing [sent. 958 len. 17]: Why should one be pleased to know that she looked quite different from what she felt ?
Parsing [sent. 959 len. 8]: There is something wrong there , surely !
Parsing [sent. 960 len. 12]: I acknowledge the something wrong , but do not understand it .
Parsing [sent. 961 len. 10]: He lifted his cap again , and rode away .
Parsing [sent. 962 len. 39]: I stood still at the foot of the lilac-tree , and , from a vapour , condensed , not to a stone , but to a world , in which a new Flora was about to be developed .
Parsing [sent. 963 len. 20]: If no new spiritual sense was awakened in me , at least I was aware of a new consciousness .
Parsing [sent. 964 len. 11]: I had never been to myself what I was now .
Parsing [sent. 965 len. 24]: Terror again seized me : the face might once more look over the wall , and find me where it had left me !
Parsing [sent. 966 len. 20]: I turned , and went slowly away from the house , gravitating to the darkest part of the garden .
Parsing [sent. 967 len. 18]: `` What has come to me , '' I said , `` that I seek the darkness ?
Parsing [sent. 968 len. 5]: Is this another secret ?
Parsing [sent. 969 len. 11]: Am I in the grasp of a new enemy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 970 len. 9]: And with that came the whirlwind of perplexity .
Parsing [sent. 971 len. 26]: Must I go the first moment I knew I could find him , and tell my uncle what had happened , and how I felt ?
Parsing [sent. 972 len. 25]: or must I have , and hold , and cherish in silent heart , a thing so wondrous , so precious , so absorbing ?
Parsing [sent. 973 len. 25]: Had I not deliberately promised -- of my own will and at my own instance -- never again to have a secret from him ?
Parsing [sent. 974 len. 5]: Was this a secret ?
Parsing [sent. 975 len. 6]: Was it not a secret ?
Parsing [sent. 976 len. 9]: The storm was up , and went on .
Parsing [sent. 977 len. 49]: The wonder is that , in the fire of the new torment , I did not come to loathe the very thought of the young man -- which would have delivered me , if not from the necessity of confession , yet from the main difficulty in confessing .
Parsing [sent. 978 len. 29]: I said to myself that the old secret was of a wrong done to my uncle ; that what had made me miserable then was a bad secret .
Parsing [sent. 979 len. 17]: The perception of this difference gave me comfort for a time , but not for long .
Parsing [sent. 980 len. 18]: The fact remained , that I knew something concerning myself which my best friend did not know .
Parsing [sent. 981 len. 17]: It was , and I could not prevent it from being , a barrier between us !
Parsing [sent. 982 len. 10]: Yet what was it I was concealing from him ?
Parsing [sent. 983 len. 7]: What had I to tell him ?
Parsing [sent. 984 len. 25]: How was I to represent a thing of which I knew neither the name nor the nature , a thing I could not describe ?
Parsing [sent. 985 len. 9]: Could I confess what I did not understand ?
Parsing [sent. 986 len. 26]: The thing might be what , in the tales I had read , was called love , but I did not know that it was .
Parsing [sent. 987 len. 21]: It might be something new , peculiar to myself ; something for which there was no word in the language !
Parsing [sent. 988 len. 6]: How was I to tell ?
Parsing [sent. 989 len. 28]: I saw plainly that , if I tried to convey my new experience , I should not get beyond the statement that I had a new experience .
Parsing [sent. 990 len. 34]: It did not occur to me that the thing might be so well known , that a mere hint of the feelings concerned , would enable any older person to classify the consciousness .
Parsing [sent. 991 len. 11]: I said to myself I should merely perplex my uncle .
Parsing [sent. 992 len. 35]: And in truth I believe that love , in every mind in which it arises , will vary in colour and form -- will always partake of that mind 's individual isolation in difference .
Parsing [sent. 993 len. 11]: This , however , is nothing to the present point .
Parsing [sent. 994 len. 56]: Comfort myself as I might , that the impossible was required of no one , and granted that the thing was impossible , it was none the less a cause of misery , a present disaster : I was aware , and soon my uncle would be aware , of an impenetrable something separating us .
Parsing [sent. 995 len. 24]: I felt that we had already begun to grow strange to each other , and the feeling lay like death at my heart .
Parsing [sent. 996 len. 39]: Our lessons together were still going on ; that I was no longer a child had made only the difference that progress must make ; and I had no thought that they would not thus go on always .
Parsing [sent. 997 len. 22]: They were never for a moment irksome to me ; I might be tired by them , but never of them .
Parsing [sent. 998 len. 28]: We were regularly at work together by seven , and after half an hour for breakfast , resumed work ; at half-past eleven our lessons were over .
Parsing [sent. 999 len. 27]: But although the day was then clear of the imperative , much the greater part of it was in general passed in each other 's company .
Parsing [sent. 1000 len. 17]: We might not speak a word , but we would be hours together in the study .
Parsing [sent. 1001 len. 16]: We might not speak a word , but we would be hours together on horseback .
Parsing [sent. 1002 len. 18]: For this day , then , our lessons were over , and my uncle was from home .
Parsing [sent. 1003 len. 29]: This was an indisputable relief , yet the fact that it was so , pained me keenly , for I recognized in it the first of the schism .
Parsing [sent. 1004 len. 12]: How I got through the day , I can not tell .
Parsing [sent. 1005 len. 13]: I was in a dream , not all a dream of delight .
Parsing [sent. 1006 len. 44]: Haunted with the face I had seen , and living in the new consciousness it had waked in me , I spent most of it in the garden , now in the glooms of the yew-walks , and now in the smiling wilderness .
Parsing [sent. 1007 len. 55]: It was odd , however , that , although I was not _ expected _ to be in my uncle 's room at any time but that of lessons , all the morning I had a feeling as if I ought to be there , while yet glad that my uncle was not there .
Parsing [sent. 1008 len. 13]: It was late before he returned , and I went to bed .
Parsing [sent. 1009 len. 16]: Perhaps I retired so soon that I might not have to look into his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1010 len. 10]: Usually , I sat now until he came home .
Parsing [sent. 1011 len. 13]: I was long in getting to sleep , and then I dreamed .
Parsing [sent. 1012 len. 27]: I thought I was out in the storm , and the flash came which revealed the horse and his rider , but they were both different .
Parsing [sent. 1013 len. 38]: The horse in the dream was black as coal , as if carved out of the night itself ; and the man upon him was the beautiful stranger whose horse I had not seen for the garden-wall .
Parsing [sent. 1014 len. 14]: The darkness fell , and the voice of my uncle called to me .
Parsing [sent. 1015 len. 47]: I waited for him in the storm with a troubled heart , for I knew he had not seen that vision , and I could no more tell him of it , than could Christabel tell her father what she had seen after she lay down .
Parsing [sent. 1016 len. 10]: I woke , but my waking was no relief .
Parsing [sent. 1017 len. 3]: CHAPTER XI .
Parsing [sent. 1018 len. 4]: THE MOLE BURROWS .
Parsing [sent. 1019 len. 30]: I slept again after my dream , and do not know whether he came into my room as he generally did when he had not said good-night to me .
Parsing [sent. 1020 len. 34]: Of course I woke unhappy , and the morning-world had lost something of its natural glow , its lovely freshness : it was not this time a thing new-born of the creating word .
Parsing [sent. 1021 len. 6]: I dawdled with my dressing .
Parsing [sent. 1022 len. 27]: The face kept coming , and brought me no peace , yet brought me something for which it seemed worth while even to lose my peace .
Parsing [sent. 1023 len. 20]: But I did not know then , and do not yet know what the loss of peace actually means .
Parsing [sent. 1024 len. 18]: I only know that it must be something far more terrible than anything I have ever known .
Parsing [sent. 1025 len. 32]: I remained so far true to my uncle , however , that not even for what the face seemed to promise me , would I have consented to cause him trouble .
Parsing [sent. 1026 len. 19]: For what I saw in the face , I would do anything , I thought , except that .
Parsing [sent. 1027 len. 28]: I went to him at the usual hour , determined that nothing should distract me from my work -- that he should perceive no difference in me .
Parsing [sent. 1028 len. 21]: I was not at the moment awake to the fact that here again were love and deception hand in hand .
Parsing [sent. 1029 len. 22]: But another love than mine was there : my uncle loved me immeasurably more than I yet loved that heavenly vision .
Parsing [sent. 1030 len. 26]: True love is keen-sighted as the eagle , and my uncle 's love was love true , therefore he saw what I sought to hide .
Parsing [sent. 1031 len. 39]: It is only the shadow of love , generally a grotesque , ugly thing , like so many other shadows , that is blind either to the troubles or the faults of the shadow it seems to love .
Parsing [sent. 1032 len. 23]: The moment our eyes met , I saw that he saw something in mine that was not there when last we parted .
Parsing [sent. 1033 len. 13]: But he said nothing , and we sat down to our lessons .
Parsing [sent. 1034 len. 26]: Every now and then as they proceeded , however , I felt rather than saw his eyes rest on me for a moment , questioning .
Parsing [sent. 1035 len. 11]: I had never known them rest on me so before .
Parsing [sent. 1036 len. 37]: Plainly he was aware of some change ; and could there be anything different in the relation of two who so long had loved each other , without something being less well and good than before ?
Parsing [sent. 1037 len. 45]: Nor was it indeed wonderful he should see a difference ; for , with all the might of my resolve to do even better than usual , I would now and then find myself unconscious of what either of us had last been saying .
Parsing [sent. 1038 len. 14]: The face had come yet again , and driven everything from its presence !
Parsing [sent. 1039 len. 25]: I grew angry -- not with the youth , but with his face , for appearing so often when I did not invite it .
Parsing [sent. 1040 len. 17]: Once I caught myself on the verge of crying out , `` Ca n't you wait ?
Parsing [sent. 1041 len. 6]: I will come presently ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1042 len. 11]: and my uncle looked up as if I had spoken .
Parsing [sent. 1043 len. 43]: Perhaps he had as good as heard the words ; he possessed what almost seemed a supernatural faculty of divining the thought of another -- not , I was sure , by any effort to perceive it , but by involuntary intuition .
Parsing [sent. 1044 len. 22]: He uttered no inquiring word , but a light sigh escaped him , which all but made me burst into tears .
Parsing [sent. 1045 len. 16]: I was on one side of a widening gulf , and he on the other !
Parsing [sent. 1046 len. 12]: Our lessons ended , he rose immediately and left the room .
Parsing [sent. 1047 len. 21]: Five minutes passed , and then came the clatter of his horse 's feet on the stones of the yard .
Parsing [sent. 1048 len. 15]: A moment more , and I heard him ride away at a quick trot .
Parsing [sent. 1049 len. 15]: I burst into tears where I still sat beside my uncle 's empty chair .
Parsing [sent. 1050 len. 22]: I was weary like one in a dream searching in vain for a spot whereupon to set down her heart-breaking burden .
Parsing [sent. 1051 len. 29]: There was no one but my uncle to whom I could tell any trouble , and the trouble I could not have told him had hitherto been unimaginable !
Parsing [sent. 1052 len. 20]: From this my reader may judge what a trouble it was that I could not tell him my trouble .
Parsing [sent. 1053 len. 9]: I was a traitor to my only friend !
Parsing [sent. 1054 len. 8]: Had I begun to love him less ?
Parsing [sent. 1055 len. 9]: had I begun to turn away from him ?
Parsing [sent. 1056 len. 6]: I dared not believe it .
Parsing [sent. 1057 len. 11]: That would have been to give eternity to my misery .
Parsing [sent. 1058 len. 15]: But it might be that at heart I was a bad , treacherous girl !
Parsing [sent. 1059 len. 8]: I had again a secret from him !
Parsing [sent. 1060 len. 8]: I was not _ with _ him !
Parsing [sent. 1061 len. 6]: I went into the garden .
Parsing [sent. 1062 len. 7]: The day was sultry and oppressive .
Parsing [sent. 1063 len. 6]: Coolness or comfort was nowhere .
Parsing [sent. 1064 len. 27]: I sought the shadow of the live yew-walls ; there was shelter in the shadow , but it oppressed the lungs while it comforted the eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1065 len. 16]: Not a breath of wind breathed ; the atmosphere seemed to have lost its life-giving .
Parsing [sent. 1066 len. 7]: I went out into the wilderness .
Parsing [sent. 1067 len. 27]: There the air was filled and heaped with the odours of the heavenly plants that crowded its humble floor , but they gave me no welcome .
Parsing [sent. 1068 len. 22]: Between two bushes that flamed out roses , I lay down , and the heather and the rose-trees closed above me .
Parsing [sent. 1069 len. 35]: My mind was in such a confusion of pain and pleasure -- not without a hope of deliverance somewhere in its clouded sky -- that I could think no more , and fell asleep .
Parsing [sent. 1070 len. 19]: I imagine that , had I never again seen the young man , I should not have suffered .
Parsing [sent. 1071 len. 30]: I think that , by slow natural degrees , his phantasmal presence would have ceased to haunt me , and gradually I should have returned to my former condition .
Parsing [sent. 1072 len. 23]: I do not mean I should have forgotten him , but neither should I have been troubled when I thought of him .
Parsing [sent. 1073 len. 11]: I know I should never have regretted having seen him .
Parsing [sent. 1074 len. 37]: In that , I had nothing to blame myself for , and should have felt -- not that a glory had passed away from the earth , but that I had had a vision of bliss .
Parsing [sent. 1075 len. 36]: What it was , I should not have had the power to recall , but it would have left with me the faith that I had beheld something too ethereal for my memory to store .
Parsing [sent. 1076 len. 22]: I should have consoled myself both with the dream , and with the conviction that I should not dream it again .
Parsing [sent. 1077 len. 19]: The peaceful sense of recovered nearness to my uncle would have been far more precious than the dream .
Parsing [sent. 1078 len. 46]: The sudden fire of transfiguration that had for a moment flamed out of the All , and straightway withdrawn , would have become a memory only ; but none the less would that enlargement of the child way of seeing things have remained with me .
Parsing [sent. 1079 len. 38]: I do not think that would ever have left me : it is the care of the prudent wise that bleaches the grass , and is as the fumes of sulphur to the red rose of life .
Parsing [sent. 1080 len. 11]: Outwearied with inward conflict , I slept a dreamless sleep .
Parsing [sent. 1081 len. 3]: CHAPTER XII .
Parsing [sent. 1082 len. 3]: A LETTER .
Parsing [sent. 1083 len. 16]: A cool soft breeze went through the curtains of my couch , and I awoke .
Parsing [sent. 1084 len. 15]: The blooms of the peasant-briars and the court-roses were waving together over my head .
Parsing [sent. 1085 len. 43]: The sigh of the wind had breathed itself out over the far heath , and ere it died in my fairy forest of lowly plants and bushes , had found and fanned the cheeks that lay down hot and athirst for air .
Parsing [sent. 1086 len. 11]: It gave me new life , and I rose refreshed .
Parsing [sent. 1087 len. 6]: Something fluttered to the ground .
Parsing [sent. 1088 len. 17]: I thought it was a leaf from a white rose above me , but I looked .
Parsing [sent. 1089 len. 9]: At my feet lay a piece of paper .
Parsing [sent. 1090 len. 5]: I took it up .
Parsing [sent. 1091 len. 25]: It had been folded very hastily , and had no address , but who could have a better right to unfold it than I !
Parsing [sent. 1092 len. 11]: It might be nothing ; it might be a letter .
Parsing [sent. 1093 len. 5]: Should I open it ?
Parsing [sent. 1094 len. 24]: Should I not rather seize the opportunity of setting things right between my heart and my uncle by taking it to him unopened ?
Parsing [sent. 1095 len. 27]: Only , if it were indeed -- I dared hardly even in thought complete the supposition -- might it not be a wrong to the youth ?
Parsing [sent. 1096 len. 8]: Might not the paper contain a confidence ?
Parsing [sent. 1097 len. 19]: might it not be the messenger of a heart that trusted me before even it knew my name ?
Parsing [sent. 1098 len. 16]: Would I inaugurate our acquaintance with an act of treachery , or at least distrust ?
Parsing [sent. 1099 len. 17]: Right or wrong , thus my heart reasoned , and to its reasoning I gave heed .
Parsing [sent. 1100 len. 22]: `` It will , '' I said , `` be time enough to resolve , when I know concerning what ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1101 len. 24]: This , I now see , was juggling ; for the question was whether I should be open with my uncle or not .
Parsing [sent. 1102 len. 38]: `` It might be , '' I said to myself , `` that , the moment I knew the contents of the paper , I should reproach myself that I had not read it at once ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1103 len. 13]: I sat down on a bush of heather , and unfolded it .
Parsing [sent. 1104 len. 29]: This is what I found , written with a pencil : -- `` I am the man to whom you talked so kindly over your garden wall yesterday .
Parsing [sent. 1105 len. 10]: I fear you may think me presuming and impertinent .
Parsing [sent. 1106 len. 11]: Presuming I may be , but impertinent , surely not !
Parsing [sent. 1107 len. 20]: If I were , would not my heart tell me so , seeing it is all on your side ?
Parsing [sent. 1108 len. 14]: `` My name is John Day ; I do not yet know yours .
Parsing [sent. 1109 len. 20]: I have not dared to inquire after it , lest I should hear of some impassable gulf between us .
Parsing [sent. 1110 len. 9]: The fear of such a gulf haunts me .
Parsing [sent. 1111 len. 37]: I can think of nothing but the face I saw over the wall through the clusters of lilac : the wall seems to keep rising and rising , as if it would hide you for ever .
Parsing [sent. 1112 len. 13]: `` Is it wrong to think thus of you without your leave ?
Parsing [sent. 1113 len. 27]: If one may not love the loveliest , then is the world but a fly-trap hung in the great heaven , to catch and ruin souls !
Parsing [sent. 1114 len. 44]: `` If I am writing nonsense -- I can not tell whether I am or not -- it is because my wits wander with my eyes to gaze at you through the leaves of the wild white rose under which you are asleep .
Parsing [sent. 1115 len. 32]: Loveliest of faces , may no gentlest wind of thought ripple thy perfect calm , until I have said what I must , and laid it where she will find it !
Parsing [sent. 1116 len. 12]: `` I live at Rising , the manor-house over the heath .
Parsing [sent. 1117 len. 12]: I am the son of Lady Cairnedge by a former marriage .
Parsing [sent. 1118 len. 17]: I am twenty years of age , and have just ended my last term at Oxford .
Parsing [sent. 1119 len. 7]: May I come and see you ?
Parsing [sent. 1120 len. 23]: If you will not see me , why then did you walk into my quiet house , and turn everything upside down ?
Parsing [sent. 1121 len. 19]: I shall come to-night , in the dusk , and wait in the heather , outside the fence .
Parsing [sent. 1122 len. 7]: If you come , thank God !
Parsing [sent. 1123 len. 25]: if you do not , I shall believe you could not , and come again and again and again , till hope is dead .
Parsing [sent. 1124 len. 10]: But I warn you I am a terrible hoper .
Parsing [sent. 1125 len. 25]: `` It would startle , perhaps offend you , to wake and see me ; but I can not bear to leave you asleep .
Parsing [sent. 1126 len. 7]: Something might come too near you .
Parsing [sent. 1127 len. 14]: I will write until you move , and then make haste to go .
Parsing [sent. 1128 len. 12]: `` My heart swells with words too shy to go out .
Parsing [sent. 1129 len. 8]: Surely a Will has brought us together !
Parsing [sent. 1130 len. 9]: I believe in fate , never in chance !
Parsing [sent. 1131 len. 29]: `` When we see each other again , will the wall be down between us , or shall I know it will part us all our mortal lives ?
Parsing [sent. 1132 len. 7]: Longer than that it can not .
Parsing [sent. 1133 len. 34]: If you say to me , ' I must not see you , but I will think of you , ' not one shall ever know I have other than a light heart .
Parsing [sent. 1134 len. 42]: Even now I begin the endeavour to be such that , when we meet at last , as meet we must , you shall not say , ` Is this the man , alas , who dared to love me ! '
Parsing [sent. 1135 len. 30]: `` I love you as one might love a woman-angel who , at the merest breath going to fashion a word unfit , would spread her wings and soar .
Parsing [sent. 1136 len. 13]: Do not , I pray you , fear to let me come !
Parsing [sent. 1137 len. 23]: There are things that must be done in faith , else they never have being : let this be one of them .
Parsing [sent. 1138 len. 5]: -- You stir . ''
Parsing [sent. 1139 len. 38]: As I came to these last words , hurriedly written , I heard behind me , over the height , the quick gallop of a horse , and knew the piece of firm turf he was crossing .
Parsing [sent. 1140 len. 16]: The same moment I was there in spirit , and the imagination was almost vision .
Parsing [sent. 1141 len. 12]: I saw him speeding away -- `` to come again ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1142 len. 8]: said my heart , solemn with gladness .
Parsing [sent. 1143 len. 30]: Rising-manor was the house to which the lady took me that dread night when first I knew what it was to be alone in darkness and silence and space .
Parsing [sent. 1144 len. 6]: Was that lady his mother ?
Parsing [sent. 1145 len. 8]: Had she rescued me for her son ?
Parsing [sent. 1146 len. 16]: I was not willing to believe it , though I had never actually seen her .
Parsing [sent. 1147 len. 30]: The way was mostly dark , and during the latter portion of it , I was much too weary to look up where she sat on her great horse .
Parsing [sent. 1148 len. 12]: I had never to my knowledge heard who lived at Rising .
Parsing [sent. 1149 len. 13]: I was not born inquisitive , and there were miles between us .
Parsing [sent. 1150 len. 11]: I sat still , without impulse to move a finger .
Parsing [sent. 1151 len. 4]: I lived essentially .
Parsing [sent. 1152 len. 9]: Now I knew what had come to me .
Parsing [sent. 1153 len. 18]: It was no merely idiosyncratic experience , for the youth had the same : it was love !
Parsing [sent. 1154 len. 12]: How otherwise could we thus be drawn together from both sides !
Parsing [sent. 1155 len. 21]: Verily it seemed also good enough to be that wondrous thing ever on the lips of poets and tale-weaving magicians !
Parsing [sent. 1156 len. 15]: Was it not far beyond any notion of it their words had given me ?
Parsing [sent. 1157 len. 4]: But my uncle !
Parsing [sent. 1158 len. 4]: There lay bitterness !
Parsing [sent. 1159 len. 17]: Was I indeed false to him , that now the thought of him was a pain ?
Parsing [sent. 1160 len. 10]: Had I begun a new life apart from him ?
Parsing [sent. 1161 len. 10]: To tell him would perhaps check the terrible separation !
Parsing [sent. 1162 len. 8]: But how was I to tell him ?
Parsing [sent. 1163 len. 12]: For the first time I knew that I had no mother !
Parsing [sent. 1164 len. 14]: Would Mr. Day 's mother be my mother too , and help me ?
Parsing [sent. 1165 len. 35]: But from no woman save my own mother , hardly even from her , would I ask mediation with the uncle I had loved and trusted all my life and with my whole heart .
Parsing [sent. 1166 len. 21]: I had never known father or mother , save as he had been father and mother and everybody to me !
Parsing [sent. 1167 len. 6]: What was I to do ?
Parsing [sent. 1168 len. 19]: Gladly would I have hurried to some desert place , and there waited for the light I needed .
Parsing [sent. 1169 len. 31]: That I was no longer in any uncertainty as to the word that described my condition , did not , I found , make it easy to use the word .
Parsing [sent. 1170 len. 35]: `` Perhaps , '' I argued , struggling in the toils of my new liberty , `` my uncle knows nothing of this kind of love , and would be unable to understand me !
Parsing [sent. 1171 len. 40]: Suppose I confessed to him what I felt toward a man I had spoken to but once , and then only to tell him the way to Dumbleton , would he not think me out of my mind ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1172 len. 37]: At length I bethought me that , so long as I did not know what to do , I was not required to do anything ; I must wait till I did know what to do .
Parsing [sent. 1173 len. 27]: But with the thought came suffering enough to be the wages of any sin that , so far as I knew , I had ever committed .
Parsing [sent. 1174 len. 26]: For the conviction awoke that already the love that had hitherto been the chief joy of my being , had begun to pale and fade .
Parsing [sent. 1175 len. 11]: Was it possible I was ceasing to love my uncle ?
Parsing [sent. 1176 len. 13]: What could any love be worth if mine should fail my uncle !
Parsing [sent. 1177 len. 20]: Love itself must be a mockery , and life but a ceaseless sliding down to the death of indifference !
Parsing [sent. 1178 len. 19]: Even if I never ceased to love him , it was just as bad to love him less !
Parsing [sent. 1179 len. 8]: Had he not been everything to me ?
Parsing [sent. 1180 len. 13]: -- and this man , what had he ever done for me ?
Parsing [sent. 1181 len. 23]: Doubtless we are to love even our enemies ; but are we to love them as tenderly as we love our friends ?
Parsing [sent. 1182 len. 40]: Or are we to love the friend of yesterday , of whom we know nothing though we may believe everything , as we love those who have taken all the trouble to make true men and women of us ?
Parsing [sent. 1183 len. 11]: `` What can be the matter with my soul ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1184 len. 3]: I said .
Parsing [sent. 1185 len. 22]: `` Can that soul be right made , in which one love begins to wither the moment another begins to grow ?
Parsing [sent. 1186 len. 14]: If I be so made , I can not help being worthless ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1187 len. 44]: It was then first , I think , that I received a notion -- anything like a true notion , that is , of my need of a God -- whence afterward I came to see the one need of the whole race .
Parsing [sent. 1188 len. 108]: Of course , not being able to make ourselves , it needed a God to make us ; but that making were a small thing indeed , if he left us so unfinished that we could come to nothing right ; -- if he left us so that we could think or do or be nothing right ; -- if our souls were created so puny , for instance , that there was not room in them to love as they could not help loving , without ceasing to love where they were bound by every obligation to love right heartily , and more and more deeply !
Parsing [sent. 1189 len. 16]: But had I not been growing all the time I had been in the world ?
Parsing [sent. 1190 len. 10]: There must then be the possibility of growing still !
Parsing [sent. 1191 len. 20]: If there was not room in me , there must be room in God for me to become larger !
Parsing [sent. 1192 len. 11]: The room in God must be made room in me !
Parsing [sent. 1193 len. 29]: God had not done making me , in fact , and I sorely needed him to go on making me ; I sorely needed to be made out !
Parsing [sent. 1194 len. 23]: What if this new joy and this new terror had come , had been sent , in order to make me grow ?
Parsing [sent. 1195 len. 15]: At least the doors were open ; I could go out and forsake myself !
Parsing [sent. 1196 len. 32]: If a living power had caused me -- and certainly I did not cause myself -- then that living power knew all about me , knew every smallness that distressed me !
Parsing [sent. 1197 len. 6]: Where should I find him ?
Parsing [sent. 1198 len. 20]: He could not be so far that the misery of one of his own children could not reach him !
Parsing [sent. 1199 len. 17]: I turned my face into the grass , and prayed as I had never prayed before .
Parsing [sent. 1200 len. 42]: I had always gone to church , and made the responses attentively , while I knew that was not praying , and tried to pray better than that ; but now I was really asking from God something I sorely wanted .
Parsing [sent. 1201 len. 15]: `` Father in heaven , '' I said , `` I am so miserable !
Parsing [sent. 1202 len. 6]: Please , help me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1203 len. 33]: I rose , went into the house , and up to the study , took a sock I was knitting for my uncle , and sat down to wait what would come .
Parsing [sent. 1204 len. 11]: I could think no more ; I could only wait .
Parsing [sent. 1205 len. 3]: CHAPTER XIII .
Parsing [sent. 1206 len. 5]: OLD LOVE AND NEW .
Parsing [sent. 1207 len. 27]: While I waited , as nearly a log , under the weariness of spiritual unrest , as a girl could well be , the door opened .
Parsing [sent. 1208 len. 32]: Very seldom did that door open to any one but my uncle or myself : he would let no one but me touch his books , or even dust the room .
Parsing [sent. 1209 len. 9]: I jumped from the chest where I sat .
Parsing [sent. 1210 len. 6]: It was only Martha Moon .
Parsing [sent. 1211 len. 9]: `` How you startled me , Martha ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1212 len. 3]: I cried .
Parsing [sent. 1213 len. 7]: `` No wonder , child ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1214 len. 3]: she answered .
Parsing [sent. 1215 len. 7]: `` I come with bad news !
Parsing [sent. 1216 len. 7]: Your uncle has had a fall .
Parsing [sent. 1217 len. 13]: He is laid up at Wittenage with a broken right arm . ''
Parsing [sent. 1218 len. 5]: I burst into tears .
Parsing [sent. 1219 len. 6]: `` Oh , Martha ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1220 len. 11]: I cried ; `` I must go to him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1221 len. 12]: `` He has sent for me , '' she answered quietly .
Parsing [sent. 1222 len. 11]: `` Dick is putting the horse to the phaeton . ''
Parsing [sent. 1223 len. 10]: `` He does n't want me , then ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1224 len. 16]: I said ; but it seemed a voice not my own that shrieked the words .
Parsing [sent. 1225 len. 9]: The punishment of my sin was upon me .
Parsing [sent. 1226 len. 33]: Never would he have sent for Martha and not me , I thought , had he not seen that I had gone wrong again , and was no more to be trusted .
Parsing [sent. 1227 len. 20]: `` My dear , '' said Martha , `` which of us two ought to be the better nurse ?
Parsing [sent. 1228 len. 17]: You never saw your uncle ill ; I 've nursed him at death 's door ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1229 len. 15]: `` Then you do n't think he is angry with me , Martha ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1230 len. 7]: I said , humbled before myself .
Parsing [sent. 1231 len. 10]: `` Was he ever angry with you , Orbie ?
Parsing [sent. 1232 len. 8]: What is there to be angry about ?
Parsing [sent. 1233 len. 10]: I never saw him even displeased with you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1234 len. 46]: I had not realized that my uncle was suffering -- only that he was disabled ; now the fact flashed upon me , and with it the perception that I had been thinking only of myself : I was fast ceasing to care for him !
Parsing [sent. 1235 len. 7]: And then , horrible to tell !
Parsing [sent. 1236 len. 28]: a flash of joy went through me , that he would not be home that day , and therefore I _ could _ not tell him anything !
Parsing [sent. 1237 len. 16]: The moment Martha left me I threw myself on the floor of the desert room .
Parsing [sent. 1238 len. 6]: I was in utter misery .
Parsing [sent. 1239 len. 29]: `` Gladly would I bear every pang of his pain , '' I said to myself ; `` yet I have not asked one question about his accident !
Parsing [sent. 1240 len. 19]: He must be in danger , or he would not have sent for Martha instead of me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1241 len. 9]: How had the thing happened , I wondered .
Parsing [sent. 1242 len. 10]: Had Death fallen with him -- perhaps on him ?
Parsing [sent. 1243 len. 15]: He was such a horseman , I could not think he had been thrown .
Parsing [sent. 1244 len. 29]: Besides , Death was a good horse who loved his master -- dearly , I was sure , and would never have thrown him or let him fall !
Parsing [sent. 1245 len. 23]: A great gush of the old love poured from the fountain in my heart : sympathy with the horse had unsealed it .
Parsing [sent. 1246 len. 32]: I sprang from the floor , and ran down to entreat Martha to take me with her : if my uncle did not want me , I could return with Dick !
Parsing [sent. 1247 len. 5]: But she was gone .
Parsing [sent. 1248 len. 9]: Even the sound of her wheels was gone .
Parsing [sent. 1249 len. 11]: I had lain on the floor longer than I knew .
Parsing [sent. 1250 len. 10]: I went back to the study a little relieved .
Parsing [sent. 1251 len. 40]: I understood now that I was not glad he was disabled ; that I was anything but glad he was suffering ; that I had only been glad for an instant that the crisis of my perplexity was postponed .
Parsing [sent. 1252 len. 21]: In the meantime I should see John Day , who would help me to understand what I ought to do !
Parsing [sent. 1253 len. 12]: Very strange were my feelings that afternoon in the lonely house .
Parsing [sent. 1254 len. 16]: I had always felt it lonely when Martha , never when my uncle was out .
Parsing [sent. 1255 len. 26]: Yet when my uncle was in , I was mostly with him , and seldom more than a few minutes at a time with Martha .
Parsing [sent. 1256 len. 6]: Our feelings are odd creatures !
Parsing [sent. 1257 len. 34]: Now that both were away , there was neither time nor space in my heart for feeling the house desolate ; while the world outside was rich as a treasure-house of mighty kings .
Parsing [sent. 1258 len. 44]: The moment I was a little more comfortable with myself , my thoughts went in a flock to the face that looked over the garden-wall , to the man that watched me while I slept , the man that wrote that lovely letter .
Parsing [sent. 1259 len. 33]: Inside was old Penny with her broom : she took advantage of every absence to sweep or scour or dust ; outside was John Day , and the roses of the wilderness !
Parsing [sent. 1260 len. 17]: He was waiting the hour to come to me , wondering how I would receive him !
Parsing [sent. 1261 len. 5]: Slowly went the afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 1262 len. 23]: I had fallen in love at first sight , it is true ; not therefore was I eager to meet my lover .
Parsing [sent. 1263 len. 10]: I was only more than willing to see him .
Parsing [sent. 1264 len. 33]: It was as sweet , or nearly as sweet , to dream of his coming , as to have him before me -- so long as I knew he was indeed coming .
Parsing [sent. 1265 len. 21]: I was just a little anxious lest I should not find him altogether so beautiful as I was imagining him .
Parsing [sent. 1266 len. 19]: That he was good , I never doubted : could I otherwise have fallen in love with him ?
Parsing [sent. 1267 len. 10]: And his letter was so straightforward -- so manly !
Parsing [sent. 1268 len. 12]: The afternoon was cloudy , and the twilight came the sooner .
Parsing [sent. 1269 len. 66]: From the realms of the dark , where all the birds of night build their nests , lining them with their own sooty down , the sweet odorous filmy dusk of the summer , haunted with wings of noiseless bats , began at length to come flickering earthward , in a snow infinitesimal of fluffiest gray and black : I crept out into the garden .
Parsing [sent. 1270 len. 24]: It was dark as wintry night among the yews , but I could have gone any time through every alley of them blind-folded .
Parsing [sent. 1271 len. 17]: An owl cried and I started , for my soul was sunk in its own love-dawn .
Parsing [sent. 1272 len. 29]: There came a sudden sense of light as I opened the door into the wilderness , but light how thin and pale , and how full of expectation !
Parsing [sent. 1273 len. 38]: The earth and the vast air , up to the great vault , seemed to throb and heave with life -- or was it that my spirit lay an open thoroughfare to the life of the All ?
Parsing [sent. 1274 len. 89]: With the scent of the roses and the humbler sweet-odoured inhabitants of the wilderness ; with the sound of the brook that ran through it , flowing from the heath and down the hill ; with the silent starbeams , and the insects that make all the little noises they can ; with the thoughts that went out of me , and returned possessed of the earth ; -- with all these , and the sense of thought eternal , the universe was full as it could hold .
Parsing [sent. 1275 len. 50]: I stood in the doorway of the wall , and looked out on the wild : suddenly , by some strange reaction , it seemed out of creation 's doors , out in the illimitable , given up to the bare , to the space that had no walls !
Parsing [sent. 1276 len. 13]: A shiver ran through me ; I turned back among the yews .
Parsing [sent. 1277 len. 11]: It was early ; I would wait yet a while !
Parsing [sent. 1278 len. 18]: If he were already there , he too would enjoy the calm of a lovely little wait .
Parsing [sent. 1279 len. 14]: A small wind came searching about , and found , and caressed me .
Parsing [sent. 1280 len. 16]: I turned to it ; it played with my hair , and cooled my face .
Parsing [sent. 1281 len. 102]: After a while , I left the alley , passed out , closed the door behind me , and went straying through the broken ground of the wilderness , among the low bushes , meandering , as if with some frolicsome brook for a companion -- a brook of capricious windings -- but still coming nearer to the fence that parted the wilderness from the heath , my eyes bent down , partly to avoid the hillocks and bushes , and partly from shyness of the moment when first I should see him who was in my heart and somewhere near .
Parsing [sent. 1282 len. 9]: Softly the moon rose , round and full .
Parsing [sent. 1283 len. 30]: There was still so much light in the sky that she made no sudden change , and for a moment I did not feel her presence or look up .
Parsing [sent. 1284 len. 69]: In front of me , the high ground of the moor sank into a hollow , deeply indenting the horizon-line : the moon was rising just in the gap , and when I did look up , the lower edge of her disc was just clear of the earth , and the head of a man looking over the fence was in the middle of the great moon .
Parsing [sent. 1285 len. 20]: It was like the head of a saint in a missal , girt with a halo of solid gold .
Parsing [sent. 1286 len. 39]: I could not see the face , for the halo hid it , as such attributions are apt to do , but it must be he ; and strengthened by the heavenly vision , I went toward him .
Parsing [sent. 1287 len. 18]: Walking less carefully than before , however , I caught my foot , stumbled , and fell .
Parsing [sent. 1288 len. 55]: There came a rush through the bushes ; he was by my side , lifted me like a child , and held me in his arms ; neither was I more frightened than a child caught up in the arms of any well-known friend : I had been bred in faith and not mistrust !
Parsing [sent. 1289 len. 38]: But indeed my head had struck the ground with such force , that , had I been inclined , I could scarcely have resisted -- though why should I have resisted , being where I would be !
Parsing [sent. 1290 len. 28]: Does not philosophy tell us that growth and development , cause and effect , are all , and that the days and years are of no account ?
Parsing [sent. 1291 len. 14]: And does not more than philosophy tell us that truth is everything ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1292 len. 4]: `` My darling !
Parsing [sent. 1293 len. 5]: Are you hurt ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1294 len. 13]: murmured the voice whose echoes seemed to have haunted me for centuries .
Parsing [sent. 1295 len. 8]: `` A little , '' I answered .
Parsing [sent. 1296 len. 11]: `` I shall be all right in a minute . ''
Parsing [sent. 1297 len. 24]: I did not add , `` Put me down , please ; '' for I did not want to be put down directly .
Parsing [sent. 1298 len. 12]: I could not have stood if he had put me down .
Parsing [sent. 1299 len. 4]: I grew faint .
Parsing [sent. 1300 len. 14]: Life came back , and I felt myself growing heavy in his arms .
Parsing [sent. 1301 len. 12]: `` I think I can stand now , '' I said .
Parsing [sent. 1302 len. 7]: `` Please put me down . ''
Parsing [sent. 1303 len. 4]: He obeyed immediately .
Parsing [sent. 1304 len. 25]: `` I 've nearly broken your arms , '' I said , ashamed of having become a burden to him the moment we met .
Parsing [sent. 1305 len. 14]: `` I could run with you to the top of the hill ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1306 len. 3]: he answered .
Parsing [sent. 1307 len. 12]: `` I do n't think you could , '' I returned .
Parsing [sent. 1308 len. 13]: Perhaps I leaned a little toward him ; I do not know .
Parsing [sent. 1309 len. 7]: He put his arm round me .
Parsing [sent. 1310 len. 12]: `` You are not able to stand , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1311 len. 8]: `` Shall we sit a moment ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1312 len. 3]: CHAPTER XIV .
Parsing [sent. 1313 len. 4]: MOTHER AND UNCLE .
Parsing [sent. 1314 len. 13]: I was glad enough to sink on a clump of white clover .
Parsing [sent. 1315 len. 13]: He stretched himself on the heather , a little way from me .
Parsing [sent. 1316 len. 3]: Silence followed .
Parsing [sent. 1317 len. 9]: He was giving me time to recover myself .
Parsing [sent. 1318 len. 17]: As soon , therefore , as I was able , it was my part to speak .
Parsing [sent. 1319 len. 7]: `` Where is your horse ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1320 len. 3]: I asked .
Parsing [sent. 1321 len. 10]: The first word is generally one hardly worth saying .
Parsing [sent. 1322 len. 15]: `` I left him at a little farmhouse , about a mile from here .
Parsing [sent. 1323 len. 18]: I was afraid to bring him farther , lest my mother should learn where I had been .
Parsing [sent. 1324 len. 7]: She takes pains to know . ''
Parsing [sent. 1325 len. 9]: `` Then will she not find out ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1326 len. 7]: `` I do n't know . ''
Parsing [sent. 1327 len. 11]: `` Will she not ask you where you were ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1328 len. 3]: `` Perhaps .
Parsing [sent. 1329 len. 6]: There 's no knowing . ''
Parsing [sent. 1330 len. 14]: `` You will tell her , of course , if she does ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1331 len. 6]: `` I think not . ''
Parsing [sent. 1332 len. 6]: `` Ought n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1333 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 1334 len. 6]: `` You are sure ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1335 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1336 len. 13]: `` You do n't mean you will tell her a story ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1337 len. 5]: `` Certainly not . ''
Parsing [sent. 1338 len. 8]: `` What will you do then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1339 len. 13]: `` I will tell her that I will not tell her . ''
Parsing [sent. 1340 len. 7]: `` Would that be right ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1341 len. 20]: Through the dusk I could see the light of his smile as he answered , `` I think so .
Parsing [sent. 1342 len. 7]: I shall not tell her . ''
Parsing [sent. 1343 len. 7]: `` But , '' I began .
Parsing [sent. 1344 len. 4]: He interrupted me .
Parsing [sent. 1345 len. 7]: My heart was sinking within me .
Parsing [sent. 1346 len. 31]: Not only had I wanted him to help me to tell my uncle , but I shuddered at the idea of having with any man a secret from his mother .
Parsing [sent. 1347 len. 22]: `` It must look strange to you , '' he said ; `` but you do not know my mother ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1348 len. 13]: `` I think I do know your mother , '' I rejoined .
Parsing [sent. 1349 len. 9]: `` She saved my poor little life once .
Parsing [sent. 1350 len. 17]: -- I am not sure it was your mother , but I think it was . ''
Parsing [sent. 1351 len. 6]: `` How was that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1352 len. 6]: he said , much surprised .
Parsing [sent. 1353 len. 6]: `` When was it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1354 len. 16]: `` Many years ago -- I can not tell how many , '' I answered .
Parsing [sent. 1355 len. 10]: `` But I remember all about it well enough .
Parsing [sent. 1356 len. 13]: I can not have been more than eight , I imagine . ''
Parsing [sent. 1357 len. 11]: `` Could she have been at the manor then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1358 len. 12]: he said , putting the question to himself , not me .
Parsing [sent. 1359 len. 5]: `` How was it ?
Parsing [sent. 1360 len. 23]: Tell me , '' he went on , rising to his feet , and looking at me with almost a frightened expression .
Parsing [sent. 1361 len. 14]: I told him the incident , and he heard me in absolute silence .
Parsing [sent. 1362 len. 15]: When I had done , -- `` It _ was _ my mother ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1363 len. 22]: he broke out ; `` I do n't know one other woman who would have let a child walk like that !
Parsing [sent. 1364 len. 20]: Any other would have taken you up , or put you on the horse and walked beside you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1365 len. 12]: `` A gentleman would , I know , '' I replied .
Parsing [sent. 1366 len. 13]: `` But it would not be so easy for a lady ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1367 len. 11]: _ `` She _ could have done either well enough .
Parsing [sent. 1368 len. 15]: She 's as strong as a horse herself , and rides like an Amazon .
Parsing [sent. 1369 len. 15]: But I am not in the least surprised : it was just like her !
Parsing [sent. 1370 len. 5]: You poor little darling !
Parsing [sent. 1371 len. 30]: It nearly makes me cry to think of the tiny feet going tramp , tramp , all that horrible way , and she high up on her big horse !
Parsing [sent. 1372 len. 10]: She always rides the biggest horse she can get !
Parsing [sent. 1373 len. 24]: -- And then never to say a word to you after she brought you home , or see you the next morning ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1374 len. 32]: `` Mr. Day , '' I returned , `` I would not have told you , had I known it would give you occasion to speak so naughtily of your mother .
Parsing [sent. 1375 len. 6]: You make me unhappy . ''
Parsing [sent. 1376 len. 4]: He was silent .
Parsing [sent. 1377 len. 14]: I thought he was ashamed of himself , and was sorry for him .
Parsing [sent. 1378 len. 6]: But my sympathy was wasted .
Parsing [sent. 1379 len. 9]: He broke into a murmuring laugh of merriment .
Parsing [sent. 1380 len. 10]: `` When is a mother not a mother ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1381 len. 4]: he said . ''
Parsing [sent. 1382 len. 7]: -- Do you give it up ?
Parsing [sent. 1383 len. 8]: -- When she 's a north wind .
Parsing [sent. 1384 len. 7]: When she 's a Roman emperor .
Parsing [sent. 1385 len. 6]: When she 's an iceberg .
Parsing [sent. 1386 len. 7]: When she 's a brass tiger .
Parsing [sent. 1387 len. 3]: -- There !
Parsing [sent. 1388 len. 4]: that 'll do .
Parsing [sent. 1389 len. 8]: Good-bye , mother , for the present !
Parsing [sent. 1390 len. 32]: I may n't know much , as she 's always telling me , but I do know that a noun is not a thing , nor a name a person ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1391 len. 5]: I would have expostulated .
Parsing [sent. 1392 len. 24]: `` For love 's sake , dearest , '' he pleaded , `` we will not dispute where only one of us knows !
Parsing [sent. 1393 len. 16]: I will tell you all some day -- soon , I hope , very soon .
Parsing [sent. 1394 len. 5]: I am angry now !
Parsing [sent. 1395 len. 7]: -- Poor little tramping child ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1396 len. 24]: I saw I had been behaving presumptuously : I had wanted to argue while yet in absolute ignorance of the thing in hand !
Parsing [sent. 1397 len. 21]: Had not my uncle taught me the folly of reasoning from the ideal where I knew nothing of the actual !
Parsing [sent. 1398 len. 21]: The ideal must be our guide how to treat the actual , but the actual must be there to treat !
Parsing [sent. 1399 len. 19]: One thing more I saw -- that there could be no likeness between his mother and my uncle !
Parsing [sent. 1400 len. 12]: `` Will you tell me something about yourself , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1401 len. 3]: I said .
Parsing [sent. 1402 len. 8]: `` That would not be interesting ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1403 len. 3]: he objected .
Parsing [sent. 1404 len. 8]: `` Then why are you here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1405 len. 3]: I returned .
Parsing [sent. 1406 len. 11]: `` Can any person without a history be interesting ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1407 len. 22]: `` Yes , '' he answered : `` a person that was going to have a history might be interesting . ''
Parsing [sent. 1408 len. 16]: `` Could a person with a history that was not worth telling , be interesting ?
Parsing [sent. 1409 len. 21]: But I know yours will interest me in the hearing , therefore it ought to interest you in the telling .
Parsing [sent. 1410 len. 20]: `` I see , '' he rejoined , with his merry laugh , I shall have to be careful !
Parsing [sent. 1411 len. 15]: My lady will at once pounce upon the weak points of my logic ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1412 len. 22]: `` I am no logician , '' I answered ; `` I only know when I do n't know a thing .
Parsing [sent. 1413 len. 24]: My uncle has taught me that wisdom lies in that , '' `` Yours must be a very unusual kind of uncle ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1414 len. 3]: he returned .
Parsing [sent. 1415 len. 23]: `` If God had made many men like my uncle , I think the world would n't be the same place . ''
Parsing [sent. 1416 len. 9]: `` I wonder why he did n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1417 len. 4]: he said thoughtfully .
Parsing [sent. 1418 len. 15]: `` I have wondered much , and can not tell , '' I replied .
Parsing [sent. 1419 len. 28]: `` What if it would n't be good for the world to have many good men in it before it was ready to treat them properly ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1420 len. 3]: he suggested .
Parsing [sent. 1421 len. 12]: The words let me know that at least he could think .
Parsing [sent. 1422 len. 13]: Hitherto my uncle had seemed to me the only man that thought .
Parsing [sent. 1423 len. 8]: But I had seen very few men .
Parsing [sent. 1424 len. 10]: `` Perhaps that is it , '' I answered .
Parsing [sent. 1425 len. 7]: `` I will think about it .
Parsing [sent. 1426 len. 8]: -- Were you brought up at Rising ?
Parsing [sent. 1427 len. 8]: Have you been there all the time ?
Parsing [sent. 1428 len. 6]: Were you there that night ?
Parsing [sent. 1429 len. 13]: I should surely have known had you been in the house ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1430 len. 9]: He looked at me with a grateful smile .
Parsing [sent. 1431 len. 12]: `` I was not brought up there , '' he answered .
Parsing [sent. 1432 len. 41]: `` Rising is mine , however -- at least it will be when I come of age ; it was left me some ten years ago by a great-aunt My father 's property will be mine too , of course .
Parsing [sent. 1433 len. 7]: My mother 's is in Ireland .
Parsing [sent. 1434 len. 29]: She ought to be there , not here ; but she likes my estates better than her own , and makes the most of being my guardian . ''
Parsing [sent. 1435 len. 14]: `` You would not have her there if she is happier here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1436 len. 21]: `` All who have land , ought to live on it , or else give it to those who will .
Parsing [sent. 1437 len. 18]: What makes it theirs , if their only connection with it is the money it brings them ?
Parsing [sent. 1438 len. 25]: If I let my horse run wild over the country , how could I claim him , and refuse to pay his damages ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1439 len. 9]: `` I do n't quite understand you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1440 len. 15]: `` I only mean there is no bond where both ends are not tied .
Parsing [sent. 1441 len. 19]: My mother has no sense of obligation , so far as ever I have been able to see .
Parsing [sent. 1442 len. 37]: But do not be afraid : I would as soon take a wife to the house she was in , as I would ask her to creep with me into the den of a hyena . ''
Parsing [sent. 1443 len. 5]: It was too dreadful !
Parsing [sent. 1444 len. 3]: I rose .
Parsing [sent. 1445 len. 6]: He sprang to his feet .
Parsing [sent. 1446 len. 9]: `` You must excuse me , sir ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1447 len. 3]: I said .
Parsing [sent. 1448 len. 21]: `` With one who can speak so of his mother , I am where I ought not to be . ''
Parsing [sent. 1449 len. 40]: `` You have a right to know what my mother is , '' he answered -- coldly , I thought ; `` and I should not be a true man if I spoke of her otherwise than truly . ''
Parsing [sent. 1450 len. 8]: He would pretend nothing to please me !
Parsing [sent. 1451 len. 10]: I saw that I was again in the wrong .
Parsing [sent. 1452 len. 19]: Was I so ill read as to imagine that a mother must of necessity be a good woman ?
Parsing [sent. 1453 len. 22]: Was he to speak of his mother as he did not believe of her , or be unfit for my company ?
Parsing [sent. 1454 len. 8]: Would untruth be a bond between us ?
Parsing [sent. 1455 len. 15]: `` I beg your pardon , '' I said ; `` I was wrong .
Parsing [sent. 1456 len. 28]: But you can hardly wonder I should be shocked to hear a son speak so of his mother -- and to one all but a stranger ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1457 len. 4]: `` What ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1458 len. 17]: he returned , with a look of surprise ; `` do you think of me so ?
Parsing [sent. 1459 len. 17]: I feel as if I had known you all my life -- and before it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1460 len. 8]: I felt ashamed , and was silent .
Parsing [sent. 1461 len. 15]: If he was such a stranger , why was I there alone with him ?
Parsing [sent. 1462 len. 17]: `` You must not think I speak so to any one , '' he went on .
Parsing [sent. 1463 len. 21]: `` Of those who know my mother , not one has a right to demand of me anything concerning her .
Parsing [sent. 1464 len. 19]: But how could I ask you to see me , and hide from you the truth about her ?
Parsing [sent. 1465 len. 35]: Prudence would tell you to have nothing to do with the son of such a woman : could I be a true man , true to you , and hold my tongue about her ?
Parsing [sent. 1466 len. 11]: I should be a liar of the worst sort ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1467 len. 17]: He felt far too strongly , it was plain , to heed a world of commonplaces .
Parsing [sent. 1468 len. 8]: `` Forgive me , '' I said .
Parsing [sent. 1469 len. 8]: `` May I sit down again ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1470 len. 6]: He held out his hand .
Parsing [sent. 1471 len. 11]: I took it , and reseated myself on the clover-hillock .
Parsing [sent. 1472 len. 46]: He laid himself again beside me , and after a little silence began to relate what occurred to him of his external history , while all the time I was watching for hints as to how he had come to be the man he was .
Parsing [sent. 1473 len. 14]: It was clear he did not find it easy to talk about himself .
Parsing [sent. 1474 len. 28]: But soon I no longer doubted whether I ought to have met him , and loved him a great deal more by the time he had done .
Parsing [sent. 1475 len. 69]: I then told him in return what my life had hitherto been ; how I knew nothing of father or mother ; how my uncle had been everything to me ; how he had taught me all I knew , had helped me to love what was good and hate what was evil , had enabled me to value good books , and turn away from foolish ones .
Parsing [sent. 1476 len. 49]: In short , I made him feel that all his mother had not been to him , my uncle had been to me ; and that it would take a long time to make me as much indebted to a husband as already I was to my uncle .
Parsing [sent. 1477 len. 25]: Then I put the question : `` What would you think of me if I had a secret from an uncle like that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1478 len. 27]: `` If I had an uncle like that , '' he answered , `` I would sooner cut my throat than keep anything from him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1479 len. 20]: `` I have not told him , '' I said , `` what happened to-day -- or yesterday . ''
Parsing [sent. 1480 len. 8]: `` But you will tell him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1481 len. 7]: `` The first moment I can .
Parsing [sent. 1482 len. 11]: But I hope you understand it is hard to do .
Parsing [sent. 1483 len. 9]: My love for my uncle makes it hard .
Parsing [sent. 1484 len. 14]: It has the look of turning away from him to love another ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1485 len. 7]: With that I burst out crying .
Parsing [sent. 1486 len. 6]: I could not help it .
Parsing [sent. 1487 len. 10]: He let me cry , and did not interfere .
Parsing [sent. 1488 len. 6]: I was grateful for that .
Parsing [sent. 1489 len. 11]: When at length I raised my head , he spoke .
Parsing [sent. 1490 len. 20]: `` It has that look , '' he said ; `` but I trust it is only a look .
Parsing [sent. 1491 len. 37]: Anyhow , he knows that such things must be ; and the more of a good man and a gentleman he is , the less will he be pained that we should love one another ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1492 len. 11]: `` I am sure of that , '' I replied .
Parsing [sent. 1493 len. 34]: `` I am only afraid that he may never have been in love himself , and does not know how it feels , and may think I have forsaken him for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1494 len. 8]: `` Are you with him _ always ?
Parsing [sent. 1495 len. 13]: _ '' `` No ; I am sometimes a good deal alone .
Parsing [sent. 1496 len. 17]: I can be alone as much as I like ; he always gives me perfect liberty .
Parsing [sent. 1497 len. 16]: But I never before wanted to be alone when I could be with him . ''
Parsing [sent. 1498 len. 11]: `` But he _ could _ live without you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1499 len. 6]: `` Yes , indeed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1500 len. 3]: I cried .
Parsing [sent. 1501 len. 15]: `` He would be a poor creature that could not live without another ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1502 len. 22]: He said nothing , and I added , `` He often goes out alone -- sometimes in the darkest nights . ''
Parsing [sent. 1503 len. 10]: `` Then be sure he knows what love is .
Parsing [sent. 1504 len. 14]: -- But , if you would rather , I will tell him . ''
Parsing [sent. 1505 len. 18]: `` I could not have any one , even you , tell my uncle about me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1506 len. 5]: `` You are right .
Parsing [sent. 1507 len. 7]: When will you tell him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1508 len. 7]: `` I can not be sure .
Parsing [sent. 1509 len. 37]: I would go to him to-morrow , but I am afraid they will not let me until he has got a little over this accident , '' I answered -- and told him what had happened .
Parsing [sent. 1510 len. 31]: `` It is dreadful to think how he must have suffered , '' I said , `` and how much more I should have thought about it but for you !
Parsing [sent. 1511 len. 5]: It tears my heart .
Parsing [sent. 1512 len. 8]: Why was n't it made bigger ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1513 len. 14]: `` Perhaps that is just what is now being done with it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1514 len. 3]: he answered .
Parsing [sent. 1515 len. 8]: `` I hope it may be ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1516 len. 4]: I returned . ''
Parsing [sent. 1517 len. 10]: -- But it is time I went in . ''
Parsing [sent. 1518 len. 11]: `` Shall I not see you again to-morrow evening ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1519 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 1520 len. 7]: `` No , '' I answered .
Parsing [sent. 1521 len. 16]: `` I must not see you again till I have told my uncle everything . ''
Parsing [sent. 1522 len. 19]: `` You do not mean for weeks and weeks -- till he is well enough to come home ?
Parsing [sent. 1523 len. 11]: How _ am _ I to live till then ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1524 len. 8]: `` As I shall have to live .
Parsing [sent. 1525 len. 14]: But I hope it will be but for a few days at most .
Parsing [sent. 1526 len. 17]: Only , then , it will depend on what my uncle thinks of the thing . ''
Parsing [sent. 1527 len. 13]: `` Will he decide for you what you are to do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1528 len. 7]: `` Yes -- I think so .
Parsing [sent. 1529 len. 41]: Perhaps if he were -- '' I was on the point of saying , `` like your mother , '' but I stopped in time -- or hardly , for I think he saw what I just saved myself from .
Parsing [sent. 1530 len. 31]: It was but the other morning I made the discovery that , all our life together , John has never once pressed me to complete a sentence I broke off .
Parsing [sent. 1531 len. 12]: He looked so sorrowful that I was driven to add something .
Parsing [sent. 1532 len. 42]: `` I do n't think there is much good , '' I said , `` in resolving what you will or will not do , before the occasion appears , for it may have something in it you never reckoned on .
Parsing [sent. 1533 len. 15]: All I can say is , I will try to do what is right .
Parsing [sent. 1534 len. 13]: I can not promise anything without knowing what my uncle thinks . ''
Parsing [sent. 1535 len. 37]: We rose ; he took me in his arms for just an instant ; and we parted with the understanding that I was to write to him as soon as I had spoken with my uncle .
Parsing [sent. 1536 len. 3]: CHAPTER XV .
Parsing [sent. 1537 len. 4]: THE TIME BETWEEN .
Parsing [sent. 1538 len. 21]: I now felt quite able to confess to my uncle both what I had thought and what I had done .
Parsing [sent. 1539 len. 48]: True , I had much more to confess than when my trouble first awoke ; but the growth in the matter of the confession had been such a growth in definiteness as well , as to make its utterance , though more weighty , yet much easier .
Parsing [sent. 1540 len. 48]: If I might be in doubt about revealing my thoughts , I could be in none about revealing my actions ; and I found it was much less appalling to make known my feelings , when I had the words of John Day to confess as well .
Parsing [sent. 1541 len. 46]: I may here be allowed to remark , how much easier an action is when demanded , than it seems while in the contingent future -- how much easier when the thing is before you in its reality , and not as a mere thought-spectre .
Parsing [sent. 1542 len. 27]: The thing itself , and the idea of it , are two such different grounds upon which to come either to a decision or to action !
Parsing [sent. 1543 len. 39]: One thing more : when a woman wants to do the right -- I do not mean , wants to coax the right to side with her -- she will , somehow , be led up to it .
Parsing [sent. 1544 len. 30]: My uncle was very feverish and troubled the first night , and had a good deal of delirium , during which his care and anxiety seemed all about me .
Parsing [sent. 1545 len. 40]: Martha had to assure him every other moment that I was well , and in no danger of any sort : he would be silent for a time , and then again show himself tormented with forebodings about me .
Parsing [sent. 1546 len. 17]: In the morning , however , he was better ; only he looked sadder than usual .
Parsing [sent. 1547 len. 17]: She thought he was , for some cause or other , in reality anxious about me .
Parsing [sent. 1548 len. 18]: So much I gathered from Martha 's letter , by no means scholarly , but graphic enough .
Parsing [sent. 1549 len. 6]: It gave me much pain .
Parsing [sent. 1550 len. 23]: My uncle was miserable about me : he had plainly seen , he knew and felt that something had come between us !
Parsing [sent. 1551 len. 11]: Alas , it was no fancy of his brain-troubled soul !
Parsing [sent. 1552 len. 13]: Whether I was in fault or not , there was that something !
Parsing [sent. 1553 len. 14]: It troubled the unity that had hitherto seemed a thing essential and indivisible !
Parsing [sent. 1554 len. 9]: Dared I go to him without a summons ?
Parsing [sent. 1555 len. 24]: I knew Martha would call me the moment the doctor allowed her : it would not be right to go without that call .
Parsing [sent. 1556 len. 18]: What I had to tell might justify far more anxiety than the sight of me would counteract .
Parsing [sent. 1557 len. 39]: If I said nothing , the keen eye of his love would assure itself of the something hid in my silence , and he would not see that I was but waiting his improvement to tell him everything .
Parsing [sent. 1558 len. 9]: I resolved therefore to remain where I was .
Parsing [sent. 1559 len. 13]: The next two days were perhaps the most uncomfortable ever I spent .
Parsing [sent. 1560 len. 20]: A secret one desires to turn out of doors at the first opportunity , is not a pleasant companion .
Parsing [sent. 1561 len. 32]: I do not say I was unhappy , still less that once I wished I had not seen John Day , but oh , how I longed to love him openly !
Parsing [sent. 1562 len. 18]: how I longed for my uncle 's sanction , without which our love could not be perfected !
Parsing [sent. 1563 len. 40]: Then John 's mother was by no means a gladsome thought -- except that he must be a good man indeed , who was good in spite of being unable to love , respect , or trust his mother !
Parsing [sent. 1564 len. 35]: The true notion of heaven , is to be with everybody one loves : to him the presence of his mother -- such as she was , that is -- would destroy any heaven !
Parsing [sent. 1565 len. 52]: What a painful but salutary shock it will be to those whose existence is such a glorifying of themselves that they imagine their presence necessary to all about them , when they learn that their disappearance from the world sent a thrill of relief through the hearts of those nearest them !
Parsing [sent. 1566 len. 19]: To learn how little they were prized , will one day prove a strong medicine for souls self-absorbed .
Parsing [sent. 1567 len. 12]: `` There is nothing covered that shall not be revealed . ''
Parsing [sent. 1568 len. 3]: CHAPTER XVI .
Parsing [sent. 1569 len. 5]: FAULT AND NO FAULT .
Parsing [sent. 1570 len. 22]: The next day I kept the house till the evening , and then went walking in the garden in the twilight .
Parsing [sent. 1571 len. 29]: Between the dark alleys and the open wilderness I flitted and wandered , alternating gloom and gleam outside me , even as they chased one another within me .
Parsing [sent. 1572 len. 12]: In the wilderness I looked up -- and there was John !
Parsing [sent. 1573 len. 35]: He stood outside the fence , just as I had seen him the night before , only now there was no aureole about his head : the moon had not yet reached the horizon .
Parsing [sent. 1574 len. 12]: My first feeling was anger : he had broken our agreement !
Parsing [sent. 1575 len. 24]: I did not reflect that there was such a thing as breaking a law , or even a promise , and being blameless .
Parsing [sent. 1576 len. 18]: He leaped the fence , and clearing every bush like a deer , came straight toward me .
Parsing [sent. 1577 len. 9]: It was no use trying to escape him .
Parsing [sent. 1578 len. 8]: I turned my back , and stood .
Parsing [sent. 1579 len. 12]: He stopped close behind me , a yard or two away .
Parsing [sent. 1580 len. 9]: `` Will you not speak to me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1581 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 1582 len. 11]: `` It is not my fault I am come . ''
Parsing [sent. 1583 len. 8]: `` Whose fault then , pray ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1584 len. 9]: I rejoined , with difficulty keeping my position .
Parsing [sent. 1585 len. 6]: `` Is it mine ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1586 len. 9]: `` My mother 's , '' he answered .
Parsing [sent. 1587 len. 29]: I turned and looked him in the eyes , through the dusk saw that he was troubled , ran to him , and put my arms about him .
Parsing [sent. 1588 len. 17]: `` She has been spying , '' he said , as soon as he could speak .
Parsing [sent. 1589 len. 13]: `` She will part us at any risk , if she can .
Parsing [sent. 1590 len. 12]: She is having us watched this very moment , most likely .
Parsing [sent. 1591 len. 7]: She may be watching us herself .
Parsing [sent. 1592 len. 13]: She is a terrible woman when she is for or against anything .
Parsing [sent. 1593 len. 17]: Literally , I do not know what she would not do to get her own way .
Parsing [sent. 1594 len. 7]: She lives for her own way .
Parsing [sent. 1595 len. 15]: The loss of it would be to her as the loss of her soul .
Parsing [sent. 1596 len. 8]: She will lose it this time though !
Parsing [sent. 1597 len. 13]: She will fail this time -- if she never did before ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1598 len. 21]: `` Well , '' I returned , nowise inclined to take her part , `` I hope she will fail !
Parsing [sent. 1599 len. 6]: What does she say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1600 len. 17]: `` She says she would rather go to her grave than see me your husband . ''
Parsing [sent. 1601 len. 4]: `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1602 len. 9]: `` Your family seems objectionable to her . ''
Parsing [sent. 1603 len. 8]: `` What is there against it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1604 len. 7]: `` Nothing that I know . ''
Parsing [sent. 1605 len. 8]: `` What is there against my uncle ?
Parsing [sent. 1606 len. 8]: Is there anything against Martha Moon ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1607 len. 12]: I was indignant at the idea of a whisper against either .
Parsing [sent. 1608 len. 9]: `` What have _ I _ done ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1609 len. 4]: I went on .
Parsing [sent. 1610 len. 15]: `` We are all of the family I know : what is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1611 len. 49]: `` I do n't think she has had time to invent anything yet ; but she pretends there is something , and says if I do n't give you up , if I do n't swear never to look at you again , she will tell it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1612 len. 8]: `` What did you answer her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1613 len. 14]: `` I said no power on earth should make me give you up .
Parsing [sent. 1614 len. 27]: Whatever she knew , she could know nothing against _ you _ , and I was as ready to go to my grave as she was .
Parsing [sent. 1615 len. 17]: ` Mother , ' I said , ` you may tell my determination by your own !
Parsing [sent. 1616 len. 46]: Whether I marry her or not , you and I part company the day I come of age ; and if you speak word or do deed against one of her family , my lawyer shall look strictly into your accounts as my guardian . '
Parsing [sent. 1617 len. 10]: You see I knew where to touch her ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1618 len. 16]: `` It is dreadful you should have to speak like that to your mother ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1619 len. 31]: `` It is ; but you would feel to her just as I do if you knew all -- though you would n't speak so roughly , I know . ''
Parsing [sent. 1620 len. 12]: `` Can you guess what she has in her mind ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1621 len. 6]: `` Not in the least .
Parsing [sent. 1622 len. 5]: She will pretend anything .
Parsing [sent. 1623 len. 11]: It is enough that she is determined to part us .
Parsing [sent. 1624 len. 11]: How , she cares nothing , so she succeed . ''
Parsing [sent. 1625 len. 7]: `` But she can not ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1626 len. 7]: `` It rests with you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1627 len. 6]: `` How with me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1628 len. 13]: `` It will be war to the knife between her and me .
Parsing [sent. 1629 len. 10]: If she succeed , it must be with you .
Parsing [sent. 1630 len. 11]: I will do anything to foil her except lie . ''
Parsing [sent. 1631 len. 17]: `` What if she should make you see it your duty to give me up ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1632 len. 12]: `` What if there were no difference between right and wrong !
Parsing [sent. 1633 len. 8]: We 're as good as married ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1634 len. 26]: `` Yes , of course ; but I can not quite promise , you know , until I hear what my uncle will say . ''
Parsing [sent. 1635 len. 28]: `` If your uncle is half so good a man as you have made me think him , he will do what he can on our side .
Parsing [sent. 1636 len. 22]: He loves what is fair ; and what can be fairer than that those who love each other should marry ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1637 len. 38]: I knew my uncle would not willingly interfere with my happiness , and for myself , I should never marry another than John Day -- that was a thing of course : had he not kissed me ?
Parsing [sent. 1638 len. 25]: But the best of lovers had been parted , and that which had been might be again , though I could not see how !
Parsing [sent. 1639 len. 13]: It _ was _ good , nevertheless , to hear John talk !
Parsing [sent. 1640 len. 11]: It was the right way for a lover to talk !
Parsing [sent. 1641 len. 12]: Still , he had no supremacy over what was to be !
Parsing [sent. 1642 len. 27]: `` Some would say it can not be so great a matter to us , when we have known each other such a little while ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1643 len. 3]: I remarked .
Parsing [sent. 1644 len. 10]: `` The true time is the long time ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1645 len. 3]: he replied .
Parsing [sent. 1646 len. 23]: `` Would it be a sign that our love was strong , that it took a great while to come to anything ?
Parsing [sent. 1647 len. 23]: The strongest things -- '' There he stopped , and I saw why : strongest things are not generally of quickest growth !
Parsing [sent. 1648 len. 6]: But there was the eucalyptus !
Parsing [sent. 1649 len. 14]: And was not St. Paul as good a Christian as any of them ?
Parsing [sent. 1650 len. 15]: I said nothing , however : there was indeed no rule in the matter !
Parsing [sent. 1651 len. 20]: `` You must allow it possible , '' I said , `` that we may not be married ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1652 len. 9]: `` I will not , '' he answered .
Parsing [sent. 1653 len. 33]: `` It is true my mother may get me brought in as incapable of managing my own affairs ; but -- '' `` What mother would do such a wicked thing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1654 len. 4]: I cried . ''
Parsing [sent. 1655 len. 9]: _ My _ mother , '' he answered .
Parsing [sent. 1656 len. 4]: `` Oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1657 len. 5]: `` She _ would !
Parsing [sent. 1658 len. 10]: _ '' `` I ca n't believe it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1659 len. 8]: `` I am sure of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1660 len. 5]: I held my peace .
Parsing [sent. 1661 len. 17]: I could not help a sense of dismay at finding myself so near such a woman .
Parsing [sent. 1662 len. 22]: I knew of bad women , but only in books : it would appear they were in other places as well !
Parsing [sent. 1663 len. 12]: `` We must be on our guard , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1664 len. 5]: `` Against what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1665 len. 12]: `` I do n't know ; whatever she may do . ''
Parsing [sent. 1666 len. 11]: `` We ca n't do anything till she begins ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1667 len. 6]: `` She has begun . ''
Parsing [sent. 1668 len. 4]: `` How ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1669 len. 4]: I asked incredulous .
Parsing [sent. 1670 len. 9]: `` Leander is lame , '' he answered .
Parsing [sent. 1671 len. 7]: `` I am so sorry ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1672 len. 7]: `` I am so angry ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1673 len. 9]: `` Is it possible I understand you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1674 len. 3]: `` Quite .
Parsing [sent. 1675 len. 7]: _ She _ did it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1676 len. 7]: `` How do you know ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1677 len. 13]: `` I can no more prove it than I can doubt it .
Parsing [sent. 1678 len. 10]: I can not inquire into my mother 's proceedings .
Parsing [sent. 1679 len. 9]: I leave that sort of thing to her .
Parsing [sent. 1680 len. 19]: Let her spy on me as she will , I am not going to spy on her . ''
Parsing [sent. 1681 len. 5]: `` Of course not !
Parsing [sent. 1682 len. 18]: But if you have no proof , how can you state the thing as a fact ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1683 len. 16]: `` I have what is proof enough for saying it to my own soul . ''
Parsing [sent. 1684 len. 11]: `` But you have spoken of it to me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1685 len. 7]: `` You are my better soul .
Parsing [sent. 1686 len. 17]: If you are not , then I have done wrong in saying it to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1687 len. 27]: I hastened to tell him I had only made him say what I hoped he meant -- only I was n't his _ better _ soul .
Parsing [sent. 1688 len. 19]: He wanted me then to promise that I would marry him in spite of any and every thing .
Parsing [sent. 1689 len. 12]: I promised that I would never marry any one but him .
Parsing [sent. 1690 len. 27]: I could not say more , I said , not knowing what my uncle might think , but so much it was only fair to say .
Parsing [sent. 1691 len. 41]: For I had gone so far as to let him know distinctly that I loved him ; and what sort would that love be that could regard it as possible , at any distance of time , to marry another !
Parsing [sent. 1692 len. 16]: Or what sort of woman could she be that would shrink from such a pledge !
Parsing [sent. 1693 len. 10]: The mischief lies in promises made without forecasting thought .
Parsing [sent. 1694 len. 7]: I knew what I was about .
Parsing [sent. 1695 len. 10]: I saw forward and backward and all around me .
Parsing [sent. 1696 len. 21]: A solitary education opens eyes that , in the midst of companions and engagements , are apt to remain shut .
Parsing [sent. 1697 len. 12]: Knowledge of the world is no safeguard to man or woman .
Parsing [sent. 1698 len. 13]: In the knowledge and love of truth , lies our only safety .
Parsing [sent. 1699 len. 12]: With that promise he had to be , and was content .
Parsing [sent. 1700 len. 3]: CHAPTER XVII .
Parsing [sent. 1701 len. 3]: THE SUMMONS .
Parsing [sent. 1702 len. 13]: Next morning the post brought me the following letter from my uncle .
Parsing [sent. 1703 len. 29]: Whoever of my readers may care to enter into my feelings as I read , must imagine them for herself : I will not attempt to describe them .
Parsing [sent. 1704 len. 21]: The letter was not easy to read , as it was written in bed , and with his left hand .
Parsing [sent. 1705 len. 15]: `` My little one , -- I think I know more than you imagine .
Parsing [sent. 1706 len. 22]: I think the secret flew into your heart of itself ; you did not take it up and put it there .
Parsing [sent. 1707 len. 36]: I think you tried to drive it out , and it would not go : the same Fate that clips the thread of life , had clipped its wings that it could fly no more !
Parsing [sent. 1708 len. 17]: Did my little one think I had not a heart big enough to hold her secret ?
Parsing [sent. 1709 len. 14]: I wish it had not been so : it has made her suffer !
Parsing [sent. 1710 len. 34]: I pray my little one to be sure that I am all on her side ; that my will is to do and contrive the best for her that lies in my power .
Parsing [sent. 1711 len. 52]: Should I be unable to do what she would like , she must yet believe me true to her as to my God , less than whom only I love her : -- less , because God is so much bigger , that so much more love will hang upon him .
Parsing [sent. 1712 len. 23]: I love you , dear , more than any other creature except one , and that one is not in this world .
Parsing [sent. 1713 len. 23]: Be sure that , whatever it may cost me , I will be to you what your own perfected soul will approve .
Parsing [sent. 1714 len. 33]: Not to do my best for you , would be to be false , not to God only , but to your father as well , whom I loved and love dearly .
Parsing [sent. 1715 len. 12]: Come to me , my child , and tell me all .
Parsing [sent. 1716 len. 14]: I know you have done nothing wrong , nothing to be ashamed of .
Parsing [sent. 1717 len. 23]: Some things are so difficult to tell , that it needs help to make way for them : I will help you .
Parsing [sent. 1718 len. 4]: I am better .
Parsing [sent. 1719 len. 27]: Come to me at once , and we will break the creature 's shell together , and see what it is like , the shy thing !
Parsing [sent. 1720 len. 5]: -- Your uncle . ''
Parsing [sent. 1721 len. 21]: I was so eager to go to him , that it was with difficulty I finished his letter before starting .
Parsing [sent. 1722 len. 17]: Death had been sent home , and was in the stable , sorely missing his master .
Parsing [sent. 1723 len. 33]: I called Dick , and told him to get ready to ride with me to Wittenage ; he must take Thanatos , and be at the door with Zoe in twenty minutes .
Parsing [sent. 1724 len. 3]: We started .
Parsing [sent. 1725 len. 27]: As we left the gate , I caught sight of John coming from the other direction , his eyes on the ground , lost in meditation .
Parsing [sent. 1726 len. 3]: I stopped .
Parsing [sent. 1727 len. 16]: He looked up , saw me , and was at my side in two moments .
Parsing [sent. 1728 len. 12]: `` I have heard from my uncle , '' I said .
Parsing [sent. 1729 len. 5]: `` He wants me .
Parsing [sent. 1730 len. 7]: I am going to him . ''
Parsing [sent. 1731 len. 9]: `` If only I had my horse ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1732 len. 3]: he answered .
Parsing [sent. 1733 len. 9]: `` Why should n't you take Thanatos ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1734 len. 3]: I rejoined .
Parsing [sent. 1735 len. 13]: `` No , '' he answered , after a moment 's hesitation .
Parsing [sent. 1736 len. 7]: `` It would be an impertinence .
Parsing [sent. 1737 len. 10]: I will walk , and perhaps see you there .
Parsing [sent. 1738 len. 9]: It 's only sixteen miles , I think .
Parsing [sent. 1739 len. 9]: -- What a splendid creature he is ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1740 len. 38]: `` He 's getting into years now , '' I replied ; `` but he has been in the stable several days , and I am doubtful whether Dick will feel quite at home on him . ''
Parsing [sent. 1741 len. 10]: `` Then your uncle would rather I rode him !
Parsing [sent. 1742 len. 8]: He knows I am no tailor ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1743 len. 3]: said John .
Parsing [sent. 1744 len. 4]: `` How ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1745 len. 3]: I asked .
Parsing [sent. 1746 len. 38]: `` I do n't mean he knows who I am , but he saw me a fortnight ago , in one of our fields , giving Leander , who is but three , a lesson or two .
Parsing [sent. 1747 len. 23]: He stopped and looked on for a good many minutes , and said a kind word about my handling of the horse .
Parsing [sent. 1748 len. 9]: He will remember , I am sure . ''
Parsing [sent. 1749 len. 11]: `` How glad I am he knows something of you !
Parsing [sent. 1750 len. 26]: If you do n't mind being seen with me , then , there is no reason why you should not give me your escort . ''
Parsing [sent. 1751 len. 13]: Dick was not sorry to dismount , and we rode away together .
Parsing [sent. 1752 len. 35]: I was glad of this for one definite reason , as well as many indefinite : I wanted John to see my letter , and know what cause I had to love my uncle .
Parsing [sent. 1753 len. 18]: I forgot for the moment my resolution not to meet him again before telling my uncle everything .
Parsing [sent. 1754 len. 15]: Somehow he seemed to be going with me to receive my uncle 's approval .
Parsing [sent. 1755 len. 35]: He read the letter , old Death carrying him all the time as gently as he carried myself -- I often rode him now -- and returned it with the tears in his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1756 len. 10]: For a moment or two he did not speak .
Parsing [sent. 1757 len. 13]: Then he said in a very solemn way , `` I see !
Parsing [sent. 1758 len. 13]: I ought n't to have a chance if he be against me !
Parsing [sent. 1759 len. 12]: I understand now why I could not get you to promise !
Parsing [sent. 1760 len. 4]: -- All right !
Parsing [sent. 1761 len. 8]: The Lord have mercy upon me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1762 len. 5]: `` That he will !
Parsing [sent. 1763 len. 9]: He is always having mercy upon us ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1764 len. 14]: I answered , loving John and my uncle and God more than ever .
Parsing [sent. 1765 len. 34]: I loved John for this especially , at the moment -- that his nature remained uninjured toward others by his distrust of her who should have had the first claim on his confidence .
Parsing [sent. 1766 len. 33]: I said to myself that , if a man had a bad mother and yet was a good man , there could be no limit to the goodness he must come to .
Parsing [sent. 1767 len. 20]: That he was a man after my uncle 's own heart , I had no longer the least doubt .
Parsing [sent. 1768 len. 28]: Nor was it a small thing to me that he rode beautifully -- never seeming to heed his horse , and yet in constant touch with him .
Parsing [sent. 1769 len. 14]: We reached the town , and the inn where my uncle was lying .
Parsing [sent. 1770 len. 18]: On the road we had arranged where he would be waiting me to hear what came next .
Parsing [sent. 1771 len. 16]: He went to see the horses put up , and I ran to find Martha .
Parsing [sent. 1772 len. 31]: She met me on the stair , and went straight to my uncle to tell him I was come , returned almost immediately , and led me to his room .
Parsing [sent. 1773 len. 12]: I was shocked to see how pale and ill he looked .
Parsing [sent. 1774 len. 23]: I feared , and was right in fearing , that anxiety about myself had not a little to do with his condition .
Parsing [sent. 1775 len. 19]: His face brightened when he saw me , but his eyes gazed into mine with a searching inquiry .
Parsing [sent. 1776 len. 21]: His face brightened yet more when he found his eager look answered by the smile which my perfect satisfaction inspired .
Parsing [sent. 1777 len. 17]: I knelt by the bedside , afraid to touch him lest I should hurt his arm .
Parsing [sent. 1778 len. 18]: Slowly he laid his left hand on my head , and I knew he blessed me silently .
Parsing [sent. 1779 len. 9]: For a minute or two he lay still .
Parsing [sent. 1780 len. 22]: `` Now tell me all about it , '' he said at length , turning his patient blue eyes on mine .
Parsing [sent. 1781 len. 34]: I began at once , and if I did not tell him all , I let it be plain there was more of the sort behind , concerning which he might question me .
Parsing [sent. 1782 len. 11]: When I had ended , `` Is that everything ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1783 len. 28]: he asked , with a smile so like all he had ever been to me , that my whole heart seemed to go out to meet it .
Parsing [sent. 1784 len. 27]: `` Yes , uncle , '' I answered ; `` I think I may say so -- except that I have not dwelt upon my feelings .
Parsing [sent. 1785 len. 19]: Love , they say , is shy ; and I fancy you will pardon me that portion . ''
Parsing [sent. 1786 len. 6]: `` Willingly , my child .
Parsing [sent. 1787 len. 6]: More is quite unnecessary . ''
Parsing [sent. 1788 len. 11]: `` Then you know all about it , uncle ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1789 len. 3]: I ventured .
Parsing [sent. 1790 len. 10]: `` I was afraid you might not understand me .
Parsing [sent. 1791 len. 17]: Could any one , do you think , that had not had the same experience ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1792 len. 6]: He made me no answer .
Parsing [sent. 1793 len. 4]: I looked up .
Parsing [sent. 1794 len. 14]: He was ghastly white ; his head had fallen back against the bed .
Parsing [sent. 1795 len. 9]: I started up , hardly smothering a shriek .
Parsing [sent. 1796 len. 8]: `` What is it , uncle ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1797 len. 3]: I gasped .
Parsing [sent. 1798 len. 7]: `` Shall I fetch Martha ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1799 len. 10]: `` No , my child , '' he answered .
Parsing [sent. 1800 len. 9]: `` I shall be better in a moment .
Parsing [sent. 1801 len. 17]: I am subject to little attacks of the heart , but they do not mean much .
Parsing [sent. 1802 len. 11]: Give me some of that medicine on the table . ''
Parsing [sent. 1803 len. 26]: In a few minutes his colour began to return , and the smile which was forced at first , gradually brightened until it was genuine .
Parsing [sent. 1804 len. 26]: `` I will tell you the whole story one day , '' he said , '' -- whether in this world , I am doubtful .
Parsing [sent. 1805 len. 18]: But _ when _ is nothing , or _ where _ , with eternity before us . ''
Parsing [sent. 1806 len. 18]: `` Yes , uncle , '' I answered vaguely , as I knelt again by the bedside .
Parsing [sent. 1807 len. 35]: `` A person , '' he said , after a while , slowly , and with hesitating effort , `` may look and feel a much better person at one time than at another .
Parsing [sent. 1808 len. 28]: Upon occasion , he is so happy , or perhaps so well pleased with himself , that the good in him comes all to the surface . ''
Parsing [sent. 1809 len. 18]: `` Would he be the better or the worse man if it did not , uncle ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1810 len. 3]: I asked .
Parsing [sent. 1811 len. 18]: `` You must not get me into a metaphysical discussion , little one , '' he answered .
Parsing [sent. 1812 len. 10]: `` We have something more important on our hands .
Parsing [sent. 1813 len. 41]: I want you to note that , when a person is happy , he may look lovable ; whereas , things going as he does not like , another , and very unfinished phase of his character may appear . ''
Parsing [sent. 1814 len. 10]: `` Surely everybody must know that , uncle ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1815 len. 24]: `` Then you can hardly expect me to be confident that your new friend would appear as lovable if he were unhappy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1816 len. 30]: `` I have seen you , uncle , look as if nothing would ever make you smile again ; but I knew you loved me all the time . ''
Parsing [sent. 1817 len. 7]: `` Did you , my darling ?
Parsing [sent. 1818 len. 5]: Then you were right .
Parsing [sent. 1819 len. 45]: I dare not require of any man that he should be as good-tempered in trouble as out of it -- though he must come to that at last ; but a man must be _ just _ , whatever mood he is in . ''
Parsing [sent. 1820 len. 13]: `` That is what I always knew you to be , uncle !
Parsing [sent. 1821 len. 20]: I never waited for a change in your looks , to tell you anything I wanted to tell you .
Parsing [sent. 1822 len. 8]: -- I know you , uncle ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1823 len. 10]: I added , with a glow of still triumph .
Parsing [sent. 1824 len. 8]: `` Thank you , little one ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1825 len. 9]: he returned , half playfully , yet gravely .
Parsing [sent. 1826 len. 42]: `` All I want to say comes to this , '' he resumed after a pause , `` that when a man is in love , you see only the best of him , or something better than he really is .
Parsing [sent. 1827 len. 35]: Much good may be in a man , for God made him , and the man yet not be good , for he has done nothing , since his making , to make himself .
Parsing [sent. 1828 len. 24]: Before you can say you know a man , you must have seen him in a few at least of his opposite moods .
Parsing [sent. 1829 len. 36]: Therefore you can not wonder that I should desire a fuller assurance of this young man , than your testimony , founded on an acquaintance of three or four days , can give me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1830 len. 17]: `` Let me tell you , then , something that happened to-day , '' I answered .
Parsing [sent. 1831 len. 52]: `` When first I asked him to come with me this morning , it was a temptation to him of course , not knowing when we might see each other again ; but he had n't his own horse , and said it would be an impertinence to ride yours . ''
Parsing [sent. 1832 len. 10]: `` I hope you did not come alone ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1833 len. 5]: `` Oh , no .
Parsing [sent. 1834 len. 14]: I had set out with Dick , but John came after all . ''
Parsing [sent. 1835 len. 14]: `` Then his refusal to ride my horse does not come to much .
Parsing [sent. 1836 len. 19]: It is a small thing to have good impulses , if temptation is too much for them . ''
Parsing [sent. 1837 len. 12]: `` But I have n't done telling you , uncle ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1838 len. 8]: `` I am hasty , little one .
Parsing [sent. 1839 len. 6]: I beg your pardon . ''
Parsing [sent. 1840 len. 16]: `` I have to tell you what made him give in to riding your horse .
Parsing [sent. 1841 len. 26]: I confessed I was a little anxious lest Death , who had not been exercised for some days , should be too much for Dick .
Parsing [sent. 1842 len. 28]: John said then he thought he might venture , for you had once spoken very kindly to him of the way he handled his own horse . ''
Parsing [sent. 1843 len. 13]: `` Oh , that 's the young fellow , is it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1844 len. 19]: cried my uncle , in a tone that could not be taken for other than one of pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 1845 len. 10]: `` That 's the fellow , is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1846 len. 3]: he repeated .
Parsing [sent. 1847 len. 5]: `` H 'm ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1848 len. 13]: `` I hope you liked the look of him , uncle ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1849 len. 3]: I said .
Parsing [sent. 1850 len. 9]: `` The boy is a gentleman anyhow ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1851 len. 3]: he answered .
Parsing [sent. 1852 len. 10]: -- `` You may think whether I was pleased !
Parsing [sent. 1853 len. 11]: -- I never saw man carry himself better horseward ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1854 len. 6]: he added with a smile .
Parsing [sent. 1855 len. 14]: `` Then you wo n't object to his riding Death home again ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1856 len. 7]: `` Not in the least ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1857 len. 3]: he replied .
Parsing [sent. 1858 len. 7]: `` The man can ride . ''
Parsing [sent. 1859 len. 8]: `` And may I go with him ?
Parsing [sent. 1860 len. 11]: -- that is , if you do not want me !
Parsing [sent. 1861 len. 10]: -- I wish I could stay with you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1862 len. 9]: `` Rather than ride home with him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1863 len. 16]: `` Yes , indeed , if it were to be of use to you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1864 len. 35]: `` The only way you can be of use to me , is to ride home with Mr. Day , and not see him again until I have had a little talk with him .
Parsing [sent. 1865 len. 15]: Tyranny may be a sense of duty , you know , little one ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1866 len. 6]: `` Tyranny , uncle ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1867 len. 17]: I cried , as I laid my cheek to his hand , which was very cold .
Parsing [sent. 1868 len. 12]: `` You could not make me think you a tyrant ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1869 len. 13]: `` I should not like you to think me one , darling !
Parsing [sent. 1870 len. 17]: Still less would I like to deserve it , whether you thought me one or not !
Parsing [sent. 1871 len. 13]: But I could not be a tyrant to you if I would .
Parsing [sent. 1872 len. 9]: You may defy me when you please . ''
Parsing [sent. 1873 len. 11]: `` That would be to poison my own soul ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1874 len. 3]: I answered .
Parsing [sent. 1875 len. 18]: `` You must understand , '' he continued , `` that I have no authority over you .
Parsing [sent. 1876 len. 18]: If you were going to marry Mr. Day to-morrow , I should have no right to interfere .
Parsing [sent. 1877 len. 15]: I am but a make-shift father to you , not a legal guardian . ''
Parsing [sent. 1878 len. 10]: `` Do n't cast me off , uncle ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1879 len. 3]: I cried .
Parsing [sent. 1880 len. 20]: `` You _ know _ I belong to you as much as if you were my very own father !
Parsing [sent. 1881 len. 13]: I am sure my father will say so when we see him .
Parsing [sent. 1882 len. 10]: He will never come between you and me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1883 len. 26]: He gave a great sigh , and his face grew so intense that I felt as if I had no right to look on it .
Parsing [sent. 1884 len. 28]: `` It is one of the deepest hopes of my existence , '' he said , `` to give you back to him the best of daughters .
Parsing [sent. 1885 len. 20]: Be good , my darling , be good , even if you die of sorrow because of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1886 len. 15]: The intensity had faded to a deep sadness , and there came a silence .
Parsing [sent. 1887 len. 12]: `` Would you like me to go now , uncle ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1888 len. 3]: I asked .
Parsing [sent. 1889 len. 32]: `` I wish I could see Mr. Day at once , '' he returned , `` but I am so far from strong , that I fear both weakness and injustice .
Parsing [sent. 1890 len. 23]: Tell him I want very much to see him , and will let him know as soon as I am able . ''
Parsing [sent. 1891 len. 6]: `` Thank you , uncle !
Parsing [sent. 1892 len. 6]: He will be so glad !
Parsing [sent. 1893 len. 29]: Of course he ca n't feel as I do , but he does feel that to do anything you did not like , would be just horrid . ''
Parsing [sent. 1894 len. 29]: `` And you will not see him again , little one , after he has taken you home , till I have had some talk with him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1895 len. 10]: `` Of course I will not , uncle . ''
Parsing [sent. 1896 len. 22]: I bade him good-bye , had a few moments ' conference with Martha , and found John at the place appointed .
Parsing [sent. 1897 len. 3]: CHAPTER XVIII .
Parsing [sent. 1898 len. 4]: JOHN SEES SOMETHING .
Parsing [sent. 1899 len. 9]: As we rode , I told him everything .
Parsing [sent. 1900 len. 56]: It did not seem in the least strange that I should be so close to one of whom a few days before I had never heard ; it seemed as if all my life I had been waiting for him , and now he was come , and everything was only as it should be !
Parsing [sent. 1901 len. 8]: We were very quiet in our gladness .
Parsing [sent. 1902 len. 48]: Some slight anxiety about my uncle 's decision , and the certain foreboding of trouble on the part of his mother , stilled us both , sending the delight of having found each other a little deeper and out of the way of the practical and reasoning .
Parsing [sent. 1903 len. 47]: We did not urge our horses to their speed , but I felt that , for my uncle 's sake , I must not prolong the journey , forcing the last farthing of bliss from his generosity , while yet he was uncertain of his duty .
Parsing [sent. 1904 len. 46]: The moon was rising just as we reached my home , and I was glad : John would have to walk miles to reach his , for he absolutely refused to take Death on , saying he did not know what might happen to him .
Parsing [sent. 1905 len. 22]: As we stopped at the gate I bethought myself that neither of us had eaten since we left in the afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 1906 len. 27]: I dismounted , and leaving him with the horses , got what I could find for him , and then roused Dick , who was asleep .
Parsing [sent. 1907 len. 25]: John confessed that , now I had made him think of it , he was hungry enough to eat anything less than an ox .
Parsing [sent. 1908 len. 23]: We parted merrily , but when next we met , each confessed it had not been without a presentiment of impending danger .
Parsing [sent. 1909 len. 36]: For my part , notwithstanding the position I had presumed to take with John when first he spoke of his mother , I was now as distrustful as he , and more afraid of her .
Parsing [sent. 1910 len. 13]: Much the nearest way between the two houses lay across the heath .
Parsing [sent. 1911 len. 23]: John walked along , eating the supper I had given him , and now and then casting a glance round the horizon .
Parsing [sent. 1912 len. 33]: He had got about half-way , when , looking up , he thought he saw , dim in the ghosty light of the moon , a speck upon the track before him .
Parsing [sent. 1913 len. 28]: He said to himself it could hardly be any one on the moor at such a time of the night , and went on with his supper .
Parsing [sent. 1914 len. 33]: Looking up again after an interval , he saw that the object was much larger , but hardly less vague , because of a light fog which had in the meantime risen .
Parsing [sent. 1915 len. 99]: By and by , however , as they drew nearer to each other , a strange thrill of recognition went through him : on the way before him , which was little better than a footpath , and slowly approaching , came what certainly could be neither the horse that had carried him that day , nor his double , but what was so like him in colour , size , and bone , while so unlike him in muscle and bearing , that he might have been he , worn but for his skin to a skeleton .
Parsing [sent. 1916 len. 25]: Straight down upon John he came , spectral through the fog , as if he were asleep , and saw nothing in his way .
Parsing [sent. 1917 len. 90]: John stepped aside to let him pass , and then first looked in the face of his rider : with a shock of fear that struck him in the middle of the body , making him gasp and choke , he saw before him -- so plainly that , but for the impossibility , he could have sworn to him in any court of justice -- the man whom he knew to be at that moment confined to his bed , twenty miles away , with a broken arm .
Parsing [sent. 1918 len. 34]: Sole other human being within sight or sound in that still moonlight , on that desolate moor , the horseman never lifted his head , never raised his eyes to look at him .
Parsing [sent. 1919 len. 4]: John stood stunned .
Parsing [sent. 1920 len. 8]: He hardly doubted he saw an apparition .
Parsing [sent. 1921 len. 28]: When at length he roused himself , and looked in the direction in which it went , it had all but vanished in the thickening white mist .
Parsing [sent. 1922 len. 26]: He found the rest of his way home almost mechanically , and went straight to bed , but for a long time could not sleep .
Parsing [sent. 1923 len. 8]: For what might not the apparition portend ?
Parsing [sent. 1924 len. 33]: Mr. Whichcote lay hurt by a fall from his horse , and he had met his very image on the back of just such a horse , only turned to a skeleton !
Parsing [sent. 1925 len. 9]: Was he bearing him away to the tomb ?
Parsing [sent. 1926 len. 11]: Then he remembered that the horse 's name was Death .
Parsing [sent. 1927 len. 3]: CHAPTER XIX .
Parsing [sent. 1928 len. 5]: JOHN IS TAKEN ILL. .
Parsing [sent. 1929 len. 24]: In the middle of the night he woke with a start , ill enough to feel that he was going to be worse .
Parsing [sent. 1930 len. 24]: His head throbbed ; the room seemed turning round with him , and when it settled , he saw strange shapes in it .
Parsing [sent. 1931 len. 25]: A few rays of the sinking moon had got in between the curtains of one of the windows , and had waked up everything !
Parsing [sent. 1932 len. 8]: The furniture looked odd -- unpleasantly odd .
Parsing [sent. 1933 len. 13]: Something unnatural , or at least unearthly , must be near him !
Parsing [sent. 1934 len. 35]: The room was an old-fashioned one , in thorough keeping with the age of the house -- the very haunt for a ghost , but he had heard of no ghost in that room !
Parsing [sent. 1935 len. 15]: He got up to get himself some water , and drew the curtains aside .
Parsing [sent. 1936 len. 38]: He could have been in no thraldom to an apprehensive imagination ; for what man , with a brooding terror couched in him , would , in the middle of the night , let in the moon ?
Parsing [sent. 1937 len. 62]: To such a passion , she is worse than the deepest darkness , especially when going down , as she was then , with the weary look she gets by the time her work is about over , and she has long been forsaken of the poor mortals for whom she has so often to be up and shining all night .
Parsing [sent. 1938 len. 17]: He poured himself some water and drank it , but thought it did not taste nice .
Parsing [sent. 1939 len. 11]: Then he turned to the window , and looked out .
Parsing [sent. 1940 len. 8]: The house was in a large park .
Parsing [sent. 1941 len. 15]: Its few trees served mainly to show how wide the unbroken spaces of grass .
Parsing [sent. 1942 len. 43]: Before the house , motionless as a statue , stood a great gray horse with hanging neck , his shadow stretched in mighty grotesque behind him , and on his back the very effigy of my uncle , motionless too as marble .
Parsing [sent. 1943 len. 32]: The horse stood sidewise to the house , but the face of his rider was turned toward it , as if scanning its windows in the dying glitter of the moon .
Parsing [sent. 1944 len. 22]: John thought he heard a cry somewhere , and went to his door , but , listening hard , heard nothing .
Parsing [sent. 1945 len. 26]: When he looked again from the window , the apparition seemed fainter , and farther away , though neither horse nor rider had changed posture .
Parsing [sent. 1946 len. 22]: He rubbed his eyes to see more plainly , could no longer distinguish the appearance , and went back to bed .
Parsing [sent. 1947 len. 19]: In the morning he was in a high fever -- unconscious save of restless discomfort and undefined trouble .
Parsing [sent. 1948 len. 26]: He learned afterward from the housekeeper , that his mother herself nursed him , but he would take neither food nor medicine from her hand .
Parsing [sent. 1949 len. 6]: No doctor was sent for .
Parsing [sent. 1950 len. 24]: John thought , and I can not but think , that the water in his bottle had to do with the sudden illness .
Parsing [sent. 1951 len. 37]: His mother may have merely wished to prevent him from coming to me ; but , for the time at least , the conviction had got possession of him , that she was attempting his life .
Parsing [sent. 1952 len. 27]: He may have argued in semi conscious moments , that she would not scruple to take again what she was capable of imagining she had given .
Parsing [sent. 1953 len. 31]: Her attentions , however , may have arisen from alarm at seeing him worse than she had intended to make him , and desire to counteract what she had done .
Parsing [sent. 1954 len. 10]: For several days he was prostrate with extreme exhaustion .
Parsing [sent. 1955 len. 31]: Necessarily , I knew nothing of this ; neither was I , notwithstanding my more than doubt of his mother , in any immediate dread of what she might do .
Parsing [sent. 1956 len. 31]: The cessation of his visits could , of course , cause me no anxiety , seeing it was thoroughly understood between us that we were not at liberty to meet .
Parsing [sent. 1957 len. 3]: CHAPTER XX .
Parsing [sent. 1958 len. 4]: A STRANGE VISIT .
Parsing [sent. 1959 len. 42]: On the fifth night after that on which he left me to walk home , I was roused , about two o'clock , by a sharp sound as of sudden hail against my window , ceasing as soon as it began .
Parsing [sent. 1960 len. 27]: Wondering what it was , for hail it could hardly be , I sprang from the bed , pulled aside the curtain , and looked out .
Parsing [sent. 1961 len. 31]: There was light enough in the moon to show me a man looking up at the window , and love enough in my heart to tell me who he was .
Parsing [sent. 1962 len. 15]: How he knew the window mine , I have always forgotten to ask him .
Parsing [sent. 1963 len. 47]: I would have drawn back , for it vexed me sorely to think him too weak to hold to our agreement , but the face I looked down upon was so ghastly and deathlike , that I perceived at once his coming must have its justification .
Parsing [sent. 1964 len. 49]: I did not speak , for I would not have any in the house hear ; but , putting on my shoes and a big cloak , I went softly down the stair , opened the door noiselessly , and ran to the other side of the house .
Parsing [sent. 1965 len. 12]: There stood John , with his eyes fixed on my window .
Parsing [sent. 1966 len. 27]: As I turned the corner I could see , by their weary flashing , that either something terrible had happened , or he was very ill .
Parsing [sent. 1967 len. 9]: He stood motionless , unaware of my approach .
Parsing [sent. 1968 len. 6]: `` What is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1969 len. 13]: I said under my breath , putting a hand on his shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 1970 len. 23]: He did not turn his head or answer me , but grew yet whiter , gasped , and seemed ready to fall .
Parsing [sent. 1971 len. 17]: I put my arm round him , and his head sank on the top of mine .
Parsing [sent. 1972 len. 23]: Whatever might be the matter , the first thing was to get him into the house , and make him lie down .
Parsing [sent. 1973 len. 66]: I moved a little , holding him fast , and mechanically he followed his support ; so that , although with some difficulty , I soon got him round the house , and into the great hall-kitchen , our usual sitting-room ; there was fire there that would only want rousing , and , warm as was the night , I felt him very cold .
Parsing [sent. 1974 len. 22]: I let him sink on the wide sofa , covered him with my cloak , and ran to rouse old Penny .
Parsing [sent. 1975 len. 13]: The aged sleep lightly , and she was up in an instant .
Parsing [sent. 1976 len. 29]: I told her that a gentleman I knew had come to the house , either sleep-walking or delirious , and she must come and help me with him .
Parsing [sent. 1977 len. 12]: She struck a light , and followed me to the kitchen .
Parsing [sent. 1978 len. 12]: John lay with his eyes closed , in a dead faint .
Parsing [sent. 1979 len. 17]: We got him to swallow some brandy , and presently he came to himself a little .
Parsing [sent. 1980 len. 15]: Then we put him in my warm bed , and covered him with blankets .
Parsing [sent. 1981 len. 10]: In a minute or so he was fast asleep .
Parsing [sent. 1982 len. 7]: He had not spoken a word .
Parsing [sent. 1983 len. 16]: I left Penny to watch him , and went and dressed myself , thinking hard .
Parsing [sent. 1984 len. 38]: The result was , that , having enjoined Penny to let no one near him , _ whoever _ it might be , I went to the stable , saddled Zoe , and set off for Wittenage .
Parsing [sent. 1985 len. 8]: It was sixteen miles of a ride .
Parsing [sent. 1986 len. 41]: The moon went down , and the last of my journey was very dark , for the night was cloudy ; but we arrived in safety , just as the dawn was promising to come as soon as it could .
Parsing [sent. 1987 len. 14]: No one in the town seemed up , or thinking of getting up .
Parsing [sent. 1988 len. 24]: I had learned a lesson from John , however , and I knew Martha 's window , which happily looked on the street .
Parsing [sent. 1989 len. 40]: I got off Zoe , who was tired enough to stand still , for she was getting old and I had not spared her , and proceeded to search for a stone small enough to throw at the window .
Parsing [sent. 1990 len. 10]: The scared face of Martha showed itself almost immediately .
Parsing [sent. 1991 len. 6]: `` It 's me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1992 len. 18]: I cried , no louder than she could just hear ; `` it 's me , Martha !
Parsing [sent. 1993 len. 8]: Come down and let me in . ''
Parsing [sent. 1994 len. 46]: Without a word of reply , she left the window , and after some fumbling with the lock , opened the door , and came out to me , looking gray with scare , but none the less with all her wits to her hand .
Parsing [sent. 1995 len. 9]: `` How is my uncle , Martha ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1996 len. 3]: I said .
Parsing [sent. 1997 len. 8]: `` Much better , '' she answered .
Parsing [sent. 1998 len. 10]: `` Then I must see him at once ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1999 len. 8]: `` He 's fast asleep , child !
Parsing [sent. 2000 len. 12]: It would be a world 's pity to wake him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2001 len. 10]: `` It would be a worse pity not ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2002 len. 3]: I returned .
Parsing [sent. 2003 len. 8]: `` Very well : must-be must ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2004 len. 3]: she answered .
Parsing [sent. 2005 len. 25]: I made Zoe fast to the lamp-post : the night was warm , and hot as she was , she would take no hurt .
Parsing [sent. 2006 len. 8]: Then I followed Martha up the stair .
Parsing [sent. 2007 len. 6]: But my uncle was awake .
Parsing [sent. 2008 len. 18]: He had heard a little of our motions and whisperings , and lay in expectation of something .
Parsing [sent. 2009 len. 11]: `` I thought I should hear from you soon ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2010 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 2011 len. 15]: `` I wrote to Mr. Day on Thursday , but have had no reply .
Parsing [sent. 2012 len. 4]: What has happened ?
Parsing [sent. 2013 len. 7]: Nothing serious , I hope ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2014 len. 7]: `` I hardly know , uncle .
Parsing [sent. 2015 len. 15]: John Day is lying at our house , unable to move or speak . ''
Parsing [sent. 2016 len. 20]: My uncle started up as if to spring from his bed , but fell back again with a groan .
Parsing [sent. 2017 len. 9]: `` Do n't be alarmed , uncle ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2018 len. 3]: I said .
Parsing [sent. 2019 len. 30]: `` He is , I hope , safe for the moment , with Penny to watch him ; but I am very anxious Dr. Southwell should see him . ''
Parsing [sent. 2020 len. 11]: `` How did it come about , little one ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2021 len. 11]: `` There has been no accident that I know of .
Parsing [sent. 2022 len. 24]: But I scarcely know more than you , '' I replied -- and told him all that had taken place within my ken .
Parsing [sent. 2023 len. 8]: He lay silent a moment , thinking .
Parsing [sent. 2024 len. 18]: `` I ca n't say I like his lying there with only Penny to protect him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2025 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 2026 len. 8]: `` He must have come seeking refuge !
Parsing [sent. 2027 len. 9]: I do n't like the thing at all !
Parsing [sent. 2028 len. 11]: He is in some danger we do not know ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2029 len. 29]: `` I will go back at once , uncle , '' I replied , and rose from the bedside , where I had seated myself a little tired .
Parsing [sent. 2030 len. 11]: `` You must , if we can not do better .
Parsing [sent. 2031 len. 6]: But I think we can .
Parsing [sent. 2032 len. 11]: Martha shall go , and you will stay with me .
Parsing [sent. 2033 len. 8]: Run at once and wake Dr. Southwell .
Parsing [sent. 2034 len. 7]: Ask him to come directly . ''
Parsing [sent. 2035 len. 18]: I ran all the way -- it was not far -- and pulled the doctor 's night-bell .
Parsing [sent. 2036 len. 5]: He answered it himself .
Parsing [sent. 2037 len. 20]: I gave him my uncle 's message , and he was at the inn a few minutes after me .
Parsing [sent. 2038 len. 26]: My uncle told him what had happened , and begged him to go and see the patient , carrying Martha with him in his gig .
Parsing [sent. 2039 len. 9]: The doctor said he would start at once .
Parsing [sent. 2040 len. 22]: My uncle begged him to give strictest orders that no one was to see Mr. Day , whoever it might be .
Parsing [sent. 2041 len. 17]: Martha heard , and grew like a colonel of dragoons ordered to charge with his regiment .
Parsing [sent. 2042 len. 16]: In less than half an hour they started -- at a pace that delighted me .
Parsing [sent. 2043 len. 32]: When Zoe was put up and attended to , and I was alone with my uncle , I got him some breakfast to make up for the loss of his sleep .
Parsing [sent. 2044 len. 14]: He told me it was better than sleep to have me near him .
Parsing [sent. 2045 len. 16]: What I went through that night and the following day , I need not recount .
Parsing [sent. 2046 len. 19]: Whoever has loved one in danger and out of her reach , will know what it was like .
Parsing [sent. 2047 len. 20]: The doctor did not make his appearance until five o'clock , having seen several patients on his way back .
Parsing [sent. 2048 len. 24]: The young man , he reported , was certainly in for a fever of some kind -- he could not yet pronounce which .
Parsing [sent. 2049 len. 22]: He would see him again on the morrow , he said , and by that time it would have declared itself .
Parsing [sent. 2050 len. 21]: Some one in the neighbourhood must watch the case ; it was impossible for him to give it sufficient attention .
Parsing [sent. 2051 len. 24]: My uncle told him he was now quite equal to the task himself , and we would all go together the next day .
Parsing [sent. 2052 len. 20]: My delight at the proposal was almost equalled by my satisfaction that the doctor made no objection to it .
Parsing [sent. 2053 len. 15]: For joy I scarcely slept that night : I was going to nurse John !
Parsing [sent. 2054 len. 8]: But I was anxious about my uncle .
Parsing [sent. 2055 len. 21]: He assured me , however , that in one day more he would in any case have insisted on returning .
Parsing [sent. 2056 len. 21]: If it had not been for a little lingering fever , he said , he would have gone much sooner .
Parsing [sent. 2057 len. 10]: `` That was because of me , uncle ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2058 len. 5]: I answered with contrition .
Parsing [sent. 2059 len. 21]: `` Perhaps , '' he replied ; `` but I had a blow on the head , you know ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2060 len. 23]: `` There is one good thing , '' I said : `` you will know John the sooner from seeing him ill !
Parsing [sent. 2061 len. 19]: But perhaps you will count that only a mood , uncle , and not to be trusted ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2062 len. 3]: He smiled .
Parsing [sent. 2063 len. 20]: I think he was not _ very _ anxious about the result of a nearer acquaintance with John Day .
Parsing [sent. 2064 len. 11]: I believe he had some faith in my spiritual instinct .
Parsing [sent. 2065 len. 14]: Uncle went with the doctor in his brougham , and I rode Zoe .
Parsing [sent. 2066 len. 21]: The back of the house came first in sight , and I saw the window-blinds of my room still down .
Parsing [sent. 2067 len. 26]: The doctor had pronounced it the fittest for the invalid , and would not have him moved to the guest-chamber Penny had prepared for him .
Parsing [sent. 2068 len. 22]: In the only room I had ever occupied as my own , I nursed John for a space of three weeks .
Parsing [sent. 2069 len. 12]: From the moment he saw me , he began to improve .
Parsing [sent. 2070 len. 15]: My uncle noted this , and I fancy liked John the better for it .
Parsing [sent. 2071 len. 14]: Nor did he fail to note the gentleness and gratitude of the invalid .
Parsing [sent. 2072 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXI .
Parsing [sent. 2073 len. 4]: A FOILED ATTEMPT .
Parsing [sent. 2074 len. 59]: The morning after my uncle 's return , came a messenger from Rising with his lady 's compliments , asking if Mr. Whichcote could tell her anything of her son : he had left the house unseen , during a feverish attack , and as she could get no tidings of him , she was in great anxiety .
Parsing [sent. 2075 len. 34]: She had accidentally heard that he had made Mr. Whichcote 's acquaintance , and therefore took the liberty of extending to him the inquiry she had already made everywhere else among his friends .
Parsing [sent. 2076 len. 45]: My uncle wrote in answer , that her son had come to his house in a high fever ; that he had been under medical care ever since ; and that he hoped in a day or two he might be able to return .
Parsing [sent. 2077 len. 30]: If he expressed a desire to see his mother , he would immediately let her know , but in the meantime it was imperative he should be kept quiet .
Parsing [sent. 2078 len. 19]: From this letter , Lady Cairnedge might surmise that her relations with her son were at least suspected .
Parsing [sent. 2079 len. 22]: Within two hours came another message -- that she would send a close carriage to bring him home the next day .
Parsing [sent. 2080 len. 13]: Then indeed were my uncle and I glad that we had come .
Parsing [sent. 2081 len. 32]: For though Martha would certainly have defended the citadel to her utmost , she might have been sorely put to it if his mother proceeded to carry him away by force .
Parsing [sent. 2082 len. 50]: My uncle , in reply , begged her not to give herself the useless trouble of sending to fetch him : in the state he was in at present , it would be tantamount to murder to remove him , and he would not be a party to it .
Parsing [sent. 2083 len. 48]: When I yielded my place in the sick-room to Martha and went to bed , my heart was not only at ease for the night , but I feared nothing for the next day with my uncle on my side -- or rather on John 's side .
Parsing [sent. 2084 len. 41]: We were just rising from our early dinner , for we were old-fashioned people , when up drove a grand carriage , with two strong footmen behind , and a servant in plain clothes on the box by the coachman .
Parsing [sent. 2085 len. 37]: It pulled up at the door , and the man on the box got down and rang the bell , while his fellows behind got down also , and stood together a little way behind him .
Parsing [sent. 2086 len. 29]: My uncle at once went to the hall , but no more than in time , for there was Penny already on her way to open the door .
Parsing [sent. 2087 len. 11]: He opened it himself , and stood on the threshold .
Parsing [sent. 2088 len. 27]: `` If you please , sir , '' said the man , not without arrogance , `` we 're come to take Mr. Day home . ''
Parsing [sent. 2089 len. 36]: `` Tell your mistress , '' returned my uncle , `` that Mr. Day has expressed no desire to return , and is much too unwell to be informed of her ladyship 's wish . ''
Parsing [sent. 2090 len. 23]: `` Begging your pardon , sir , '' said the man , `` we have her ladyship 's orders to bring him .
Parsing [sent. 2091 len. 9]: We 'll take every possible care of him .
Parsing [sent. 2092 len. 18]: The carriage is an extra-easy one , and I 'll sit inside with the young gentleman myself .
Parsing [sent. 2093 len. 25]: If he ai n't right in his head , he 'll never know nothink till he comes to himself in his own bed . ''
Parsing [sent. 2094 len. 15]: My uncle had let the man talk , but his anger was fast rising .
Parsing [sent. 2095 len. 8]: `` I can not let him go .
Parsing [sent. 2096 len. 17]: I would not send a beggar to the hospital in the state he is in . ''
Parsing [sent. 2097 len. 10]: `` But , indeed , sir , you must !
Parsing [sent. 2098 len. 6]: We have our orders . ''
Parsing [sent. 2099 len. 62]: `` If you fancy I will dismiss a guest of mine at the order of any human being , were it the queen 's own majesty , '' said my uncle -- I heard the words , and with my mind 's eyes saw the blue flash of his as he said them -- `` you will find yourself mistaken . ''
Parsing [sent. 2100 len. 18]: `` I 'm sorry , '' said the man quietly , `` but I have my orders !
Parsing [sent. 2101 len. 6]: Let me pass , please .
Parsing [sent. 2102 len. 15]: It is my business to find the young gentleman , and take him home .
Parsing [sent. 2103 len. 30]: No one can have the right to keep him against his mother 's will , especially when he 's not in a fit state to judge for himself . ''
Parsing [sent. 2104 len. 20]: `` Happily I am in a fit state to judge for him , '' said my uncle , coldly .
Parsing [sent. 2105 len. 9]: `` I dare not go back without him .
Parsing [sent. 2106 len. 26]: Let me pass , '' he returned , raising his voice a little , and approaching the door as if he would force his way .
Parsing [sent. 2107 len. 38]: I ought to have mentioned that , as my uncle went to the door , he took from a rack in the hall a whip with a bamboo stock , which he generally carried when he rode .
Parsing [sent. 2108 len. 27]: His answer to the man was a smart , though left-handed blow with the stock across his face : they were too near for the thong .
Parsing [sent. 2109 len. 13]: He staggered back , and stood holding his hand to his face .
Parsing [sent. 2110 len. 22]: His fellow-servants , who , during the colloquy , had looked on with gentlemanlike imperturbability , made a simultaneous step forward .
Parsing [sent. 2111 len. 12]: My uncle sent the thong with a hiss about their ears .
Parsing [sent. 2112 len. 14]: They sprang toward him in a fury , but halted immediately and recoiled .
Parsing [sent. 2113 len. 24]: He had drawn a small swordlike weapon , which I did not know to be there , from the stock of the whip .
Parsing [sent. 2114 len. 8]: He gave one swift glance behind him .
Parsing [sent. 2115 len. 9]: I was in the hall at his back .
Parsing [sent. 2116 len. 11]: `` Shut the door , Orba , '' he cried .
Parsing [sent. 2117 len. 20]: I shut him out , and ran to a window in the little drawing-room , which commanded the door .
Parsing [sent. 2118 len. 21]: Never had I seen him look as now -- his pale face pale no longer , but flushed with anger .
Parsing [sent. 2119 len. 27]: Neither , indeed , until that moment had I ever seen the _ natural _ look of anger , the expression of _ pure _ anger .
Parsing [sent. 2120 len. 15]: There was nothing mean or ugly in it -- not an atom of hate .
Parsing [sent. 2121 len. 6]: But how his eyes blazed !
Parsing [sent. 2122 len. 17]: `` Go back , '' he cried , in a voice far more stern than loud .
Parsing [sent. 2123 len. 20]: `` If one of you set foot on the lowest step , and I will run him through . ''
Parsing [sent. 2124 len. 22]: The men saw he meant it ; they saw the closed door , and my uncle with his back to it .
Parsing [sent. 2125 len. 8]: They turned and spoke to each other .
Parsing [sent. 2126 len. 8]: The coachman sat immovable on his box .
Parsing [sent. 2127 len. 8]: They mounted , and he drove away .
Parsing [sent. 2128 len. 7]: I ran and opened the door .
Parsing [sent. 2129 len. 8]: My uncle came in with a smile .
Parsing [sent. 2130 len. 18]: He went up the stair , and I followed him to the room where the invalid lay .
Parsing [sent. 2131 len. 12]: We were both anxious to learn if he had been disturbed .
Parsing [sent. 2132 len. 9]: He was leaning on his elbow , listening .
Parsing [sent. 2133 len. 9]: He looked a good deal more like himself .
Parsing [sent. 2134 len. 11]: `` I knew you would defend me , sir ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2135 len. 15]: he said , with a respectful confidence which could not but please my uncle .
Parsing [sent. 2136 len. 13]: `` You did not want to go home -- did you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2137 len. 6]: he asked with a smile .
Parsing [sent. 2138 len. 12]: `` I should have thrown myself out of the carriage ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2139 len. 16]: answered John ; '' -- that is , if they had got me into it .
Parsing [sent. 2140 len. 25]: But , please , tell me , sir , '' he went on , `` how it is I find myself in your house ?
Parsing [sent. 2141 len. 10]: I have been puzzling over it all the morning .
Parsing [sent. 2142 len. 8]: I have no recollection of coming . ''
Parsing [sent. 2143 len. 32]: `` You understand , I fancy , '' rejoined my uncle , `` that one of the family has a notion she can take better care of you than anybody else !
Parsing [sent. 2144 len. 10]: Is not that enough to account for it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2145 len. 5]: `` Hardly , sir .
Parsing [sent. 2146 len. 13]: Belorba can not have gone and rescued me from my mother ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2147 len. 7]: `` How do you know that ?
Parsing [sent. 2148 len. 10]: Belorba is a terrible creature when she is roused .
Parsing [sent. 2149 len. 6]: But you have talked enough .
Parsing [sent. 2150 len. 12]: Shut your eyes , and do n't trouble yourself to recollect .
Parsing [sent. 2151 len. 13]: As you get stronger , it will all come back to you .
Parsing [sent. 2152 len. 18]: Then you will be able to tell us , instead of asking us to tell you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2153 len. 5]: He left us together .
Parsing [sent. 2154 len. 14]: I quieted John by reading to him , and absolutely declining to talk .
Parsing [sent. 2155 len. 6]: `` You are a captive .
Parsing [sent. 2156 len. 29]: The castle is enchanted : speak a single word , '' I said , `` and you will find yourself in the dungeon of your own room . ''
Parsing [sent. 2157 len. 20]: He looked at me an instant , closed his eyes , and in a few minutes was fast asleep .
Parsing [sent. 2158 len. 14]: He slept for two hours , and when he woke was quite himself .
Parsing [sent. 2159 len. 26]: He was very weak , but the fever was gone , and we had now only to feed him up , and keep him quiet .
Parsing [sent. 2160 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXII .
Parsing [sent. 2161 len. 5]: JOHN RECALLS AND REMEMBERS .
Parsing [sent. 2162 len. 8]: What a weight was off my heart !
Parsing [sent. 2163 len. 10]: It seemed as if nothing more could go wrong .
Parsing [sent. 2164 len. 28]: But , though John was plainly happy , he was not quite comfortable : he worried himself with trying to remember how he had come to us .
Parsing [sent. 2165 len. 38]: The last thing he could definitely recall before finding himself with us , was his mother looking at him through a night that seemed made of blackness so solid that he marvelled she could move in it .
Parsing [sent. 2166 len. 19]: She brought him something to drink , but he fancied it blood , and would not touch it .
Parsing [sent. 2167 len. 13]: He remembered now that there was a red tumbler in his room .
Parsing [sent. 2168 len. 45]: He could recall nothing after , except a cold wind , and a sense of utter weariness but absolute compulsion : he must keep on and on till he found the gate of heaven , to which he seemed only for ever coming nearer .
Parsing [sent. 2169 len. 42]: His conclusion was , that he knew what he was about every individual moment , but had no memory ; each thing he did was immediately forgotten , while the knowledge of what he had to do next remained with him .
Parsing [sent. 2170 len. 22]: It was , he thought , a mental condition analogous with walking , in which every step is a frustrated fall .
Parsing [sent. 2171 len. 40]: I set this down here , because , when I told my uncle what John had been saying , myself not sure that I perceived what he meant , he declared the boy a philosopher of the finest grain .
Parsing [sent. 2172 len. 19]: But he warned me not to encourage his talking , and especially not to ask him to explain .
Parsing [sent. 2173 len. 23]: There was nothing , he said , worse for a weak brain , than to set a strong will to work it .
Parsing [sent. 2174 len. 16]: I tried to obey him , but it grew harder as the days went on .
Parsing [sent. 2175 len. 13]: There were not many of them , however ; he recovered rapidly .
Parsing [sent. 2176 len. 39]: When at length my uncle talked not only to but with him , I regarded it as a virtual withdrawal of his prohibition , and after that spoke to John of whatever came into his or my head .
Parsing [sent. 2177 len. 23]: It was then he told me all he could remember since the moment he left me with his supper in his hand .
Parsing [sent. 2178 len. 22]: A great part of his recollection was the vision of my uncle on the moor , and afterward in the park .
Parsing [sent. 2179 len. 10]: We did not know what to make of it .
Parsing [sent. 2180 len. 63]: I should at once have concluded it caused by prelusive illness , but for my remembrance of what both my uncle and myself had seen , so long before , in the thunderstorm ; while John , willing enough to attribute its recurrence to that cause , found it impossible to concede that he was anything but well when crossing the moor .
Parsing [sent. 2181 len. 54]: I thought , however , that excitement , fatigue , and lack of food , might have something to do with it , and with his illness too ; while , if he was in a state to see anything phantasmal , what shape more likely to appear than that of my uncle !
Parsing [sent. 2182 len. 13]: He would not hear of my mentioning the thing to my uncle .
Parsing [sent. 2183 len. 25]: I would for my own part have gone to him with it immediately ; but could not with John 's prayer in my ears .
Parsing [sent. 2184 len. 13]: I resolved , however , to gain his consent if I could .
Parsing [sent. 2185 len. 29]: He had by this time as great a respect for my uncle as I had myself , but could not feel at home with him as I did .
Parsing [sent. 2186 len. 48]: Whether the vision was only a vision , or indeed my uncle 's double , whatever a double may be , the tale of it could hardly be an agreeable one to him ; and naturally John shrank from the risk of causing him the least annoyance .
Parsing [sent. 2187 len. 18]: The question of course came up , what he was to do when able to leave us .
Parsing [sent. 2188 len. 32]: He had spoken very plainly to my uncle concerning his relations with his mother -- had told him indeed that he could not help suspecting he owed his illness to her .
Parsing [sent. 2189 len. 22]: I was nearly always present when they talked , but remember in especial a part of what passed on one occasion .
Parsing [sent. 2190 len. 20]: `` I believe I understand my mother , '' said John , '' -- but only after much thinking .
Parsing [sent. 2191 len. 52]: I loved her when a child ; and if she had not left me for the sake of liberty and influence -- that at least is how I account for her doing so -- I might at this moment be struggling for personal freedom , instead of having that over . ''
Parsing [sent. 2192 len. 29]: `` There are women , '' returned my uncle , `` some of them of the most admired , who are slaves to a demoniacal love of power .
Parsing [sent. 2193 len. 30]: The very pleasure of their consciousness consists in the knowledge that they have power -- not power to do things , but power to make other people do things .
Parsing [sent. 2194 len. 13]: It is an insanity , but a devilishly immoral and hateful insanity .
Parsing [sent. 2195 len. 32]: -- I do not say the lady in question is one of such , for I do not know her ; I only say I have known such a one . ''
Parsing [sent. 2196 len. 15]: John replied that certainly the love of power was his mother 's special weakness .
Parsing [sent. 2197 len. 23]: She was spoiled when a child , he had been told ; had her every wish regarded , her every whim respected .
Parsing [sent. 2198 len. 49]: This ruinous treatment sprang , he said , from the self-same ambition , in another form , on the part of her mother -- the longing , namely , to secure her child 's supreme affection -- with the natural consequence that they came to hate one another .
Parsing [sent. 2199 len. 22]: His father and she had been married but fifteen months , when he died of a fall , following the hounds .
Parsing [sent. 2200 len. 24]: Within six months she was engaged , but the engagement was broken off , and she went abroad , leaving him behind her .
Parsing [sent. 2201 len. 27]: She married lord Cairnedge in Venice , and returned to England when John was nearly four , and seemed to have lost all memory of her .
Parsing [sent. 2202 len. 15]: His stepfather was good to him , but died when he was about eight .
Parsing [sent. 2203 len. 6]: His mother was very severe .
Parsing [sent. 2204 len. 24]: Her object plainly was to plant her authority so in his very nature , that he should never think of disputing her will .
Parsing [sent. 2205 len. 25]: `` But , '' said John , `` she killed my love , and so I grew able to cast off her yoke . ''
Parsing [sent. 2206 len. 23]: `` The world would fare worse , I fancy , '' remarked my uncle , `` if violent women bore patient children .
Parsing [sent. 2207 len. 6]: The evil would become irremediable .
Parsing [sent. 2208 len. 18]: The children might not be ruined , but they would bring no discipline to the mother ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2209 len. 23]: `` Her servants , '' continued John , `` obey her implicitly , except when they are sure she will never know .
Parsing [sent. 2210 len. 20]: She treats them so imperiously , that they admire her , and are proud to have such a mistress .
Parsing [sent. 2211 len. 40]: But she is convinced at last , I believe , that she will never get me to do as she pleases ; and therefore hates me so heartily , that she can hardly keep her ladylike hands off me .
Parsing [sent. 2212 len. 54]: I do not think I have been unreasonable ; I have not found it difficult to obey others that were set over me ; but when I found almost her every requirement part of a system for reducing me to a slavish obedience , I began to lay down lines of my own .
Parsing [sent. 2213 len. 32]: I resolved to do at once whatever she asked me , whether pleasant to me or not , so long as I saw no reason why it should not be done .
Parsing [sent. 2214 len. 18]: Then I was surprised to find how seldom I had to make a stand against her wishes .
Parsing [sent. 2215 len. 33]: At the same time , the mode in which she conveyed her pleasure , was invariably such as to make a pretty strong effort of the will necessary for compliance with it .
Parsing [sent. 2216 len. 29]: But the effort to overcome the difficulty caused by her manner , helped to develop in me the strength to resist where it was not right to yield .
Parsing [sent. 2217 len. 37]: By far the most serious difference we had yet had , arose about six months ago , when she insisted I should make myself agreeable to a certain lady , whom I by no means disliked .
Parsing [sent. 2218 len. 31]: She had planned our marriage , I believe , as one of her parallels in the siege of the lady 's noble father , then a widower of a year .
Parsing [sent. 2219 len. 21]: I told her I would not lay myself out to please any lady , except I wanted to marry her .
Parsing [sent. 2220 len. 13]: ` And why , pray , should you not marry her ? '
Parsing [sent. 2221 len. 3]: she returned .
Parsing [sent. 2222 len. 30]: I answered that I did not love her , and would not marry until I saw the woman I could not be happy without , and she accepted me .
Parsing [sent. 2223 len. 42]: She went into a terrible passion , but I found myself quite unmoved by it : it is a wonderful heartener to know yourself not merely standing up for a right , but for the right to do the right thing !
Parsing [sent. 2224 len. 19]: ` You would n't surely have me marry a woman I did n't care a straw for ! '
Parsing [sent. 2225 len. 3]: I said .
Parsing [sent. 2226 len. 6]: ` Quench my soul ! '
Parsing [sent. 2227 len. 19]: she cried -- I have often wondered where she learned the oath -- ` what would that matter ?
Parsing [sent. 2228 len. 13]: She would n't care a straw for you in a month ! '
Parsing [sent. 2229 len. 10]: -- ` Why should I marry her then ? '
Parsing [sent. 2230 len. 26]: -- ` Because your mother wishes it , ' she replied , and turned to march from the room as if that settled the thing .
Parsing [sent. 2231 len. 8]: But I could not leave it so .
Parsing [sent. 2232 len. 7]: The sooner she understood the better !
Parsing [sent. 2233 len. 4]: ` Mother ! '
Parsing [sent. 2234 len. 11]: I cried , ' I will not marry the lady .
Parsing [sent. 2235 len. 20]: I will not pay her the least attention that could be mistaken to mean the possibility of it . '
Parsing [sent. 2236 len. 5]: She turned upon me .
Parsing [sent. 2237 len. 19]: I have just respect enough left for her , not to say what her face suggested to me .
Parsing [sent. 2238 len. 23]: She was pale as a corpse ; her very lips were colourless ; her eyes -- but I will not go on .
Parsing [sent. 2239 len. 7]: ` Your father all over ! '
Parsing [sent. 2240 len. 21]: she snarled -- yes , snarled , with an inarticulate cry of fiercest loathing , and turned again and went .
Parsing [sent. 2241 len. 35]: If I do not quite think my mother , _ at present _ , would murder me , I do think she would do anything short of murder to gain her ends with me .
Parsing [sent. 2242 len. 16]: But do not be afraid ; I am sufficiently afraid to be on my guard .
Parsing [sent. 2243 len. 41]: `` My father was a rich man , and left my mother more than enough ; there was no occasion for her to marry again , except she loved , and I am sure she did not love lord Cairnedge .
Parsing [sent. 2244 len. 16]: I wish , for my sake , not for his , he were alive now .
Parsing [sent. 2245 len. 36]: But the moment , I am one and twenty , I shall be my own master , and hope , sir , you will not count me unworthy to be the more Belorba 's servant .
Parsing [sent. 2246 len. 32]: One thing I am determined upon : my mother shall not cross my threshold but at my wife 's invitation ; and I shall never ask my wife to invite her .
Parsing [sent. 2247 len. 5]: She is too dangerous .
Parsing [sent. 2248 len. 19]: `` We had another altercation about Miss Miles , an hour or two before I first saw Orba .
Parsing [sent. 2249 len. 23]: They were far from worthy feelings that possessed me up to the moment when I caught sight of her over the wall .
Parsing [sent. 2250 len. 10]: It was a leap out of hell into paradise .
Parsing [sent. 2251 len. 22]: The glimpse of such a face , without shadow of scheme or plan or selfish end , was salvation to me .
Parsing [sent. 2252 len. 5]: I thank God ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2253 len. 17]: Perhaps I ought not to let those words about myself stand , but he said them .
Parsing [sent. 2254 len. 6]: He had talked too long .
Parsing [sent. 2255 len. 17]: He fell back in his chair , and the tears began to gather in his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2256 len. 17]: My uncle rose , put his arm about me , and led me to the study .
Parsing [sent. 2257 len. 17]: `` Let him rest a bit , little one , '' he said as we entered .
Parsing [sent. 2258 len. 12]: `` It is long since we had a good talk ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2259 len. 30]: He seated himself in his think-chair -- a name which , when a child , I had given it , and I slid to the floor at his feet .
Parsing [sent. 2260 len. 25]: `` I can not help thinking , little one , '' he began , `` that you are going to be a happy woman !
Parsing [sent. 2261 len. 11]: I do believe that is a man to be trusted .
Parsing [sent. 2262 len. 22]: As for the mother , there is no occasion to think of her , beyond being on your guard against her .
Parsing [sent. 2263 len. 13]: You will have no trouble with her after you are married . ''
Parsing [sent. 2264 len. 19]: `` I can not help fearing she will do us a mischief , uncle , '' I returned .
Parsing [sent. 2265 len. 33]: `` Sir Philip Sidney says -- ` Since a man is bound no further to himself than to do wisely , chance is only to trouble them that stand upon chance . '
Parsing [sent. 2266 len. 16]: That is , we are responsible only for our actions , not for their results .
Parsing [sent. 2267 len. 11]: Trust first in God , then in John Day . ''
Parsing [sent. 2268 len. 12]: `` I was sure you would like him , uncle ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2269 len. 10]: I cried , with a flutter of loving triumph .
Parsing [sent. 2270 len. 20]: `` I was nearly as sure myself -- such confidence had I in the instinct of my little one .
Parsing [sent. 2271 len. 23]: I think that I , of the two of us , may , in this instance , claim the greater faith ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2272 len. 10]: `` You are always before me , uncle ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2273 len. 3]: I said .
Parsing [sent. 2274 len. 8]: `` I only follow where you lead .
Parsing [sent. 2275 len. 12]: But what do you think the woman will do next ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2276 len. 6]: `` I do n't think .
Parsing [sent. 2277 len. 5]: It is no use .
Parsing [sent. 2278 len. 8]: We shall hear of her before long .
Parsing [sent. 2279 len. 15]: If all mothers were like her , the world would hardly be saved ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2280 len. 11]: `` It would not be worth saving , uncle . ''
Parsing [sent. 2281 len. 15]: `` Whatever can be saved , must be worth saving , my child . ''
Parsing [sent. 2282 len. 16]: `` Yes , uncle ; I should n't have said that , '' I replied .
Parsing [sent. 2283 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXIII .
Parsing [sent. 2284 len. 4]: LETTER AND ANSWER .
Parsing [sent. 2285 len. 8]: We did hear of her before long .
Parsing [sent. 2286 len. 16]: The next morning a letter was handed to my uncle as we sat at breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 2287 len. 23]: He looked hard at the address , changed countenance , and frowned very dark , but I could not read the frown .
Parsing [sent. 2288 len. 19]: Then his face cleared a little ; he opened , read , and handed the letter to me .
Parsing [sent. 2289 len. 50]: Lady Cairnedge hoped Mr. Whichcote would excuse one who had so lately come to the neighbourhood , that , until an hour ago , she knew nothing of the position and character of the gentleman in whose house her son had , in a momentary , but , alas !
Parsing [sent. 2290 len. 12]: not unusual aberration , sought shelter , and found generous hospitality .
Parsing [sent. 2291 len. 15]: She apologized heartily for the unceremonious way in which she had sent for him .
Parsing [sent. 2292 len. 30]: In her anxiety to have him home , if possible , before he should realize his awkward position in the house of a stranger , she had been inconsiderate !
Parsing [sent. 2293 len. 32]: She left it to the judgment of his kind host whether she should herself come to fetch him , or send her carriage with the medical man who usually attended him .
Parsing [sent. 2294 len. 19]: In either case her servants must accompany the carriage , as he would probably object to being removed .
Parsing [sent. 2295 len. 23]: He might , however , be perfectly manageable , for he was , when himself , the gentlest creature in the world !
Parsing [sent. 2296 len. 6]: I was in a rage .
Parsing [sent. 2297 len. 20]: I looked up , expecting to see my uncle as indignant with the diabolical woman as I was myself .
Parsing [sent. 2298 len. 16]: But he seemed sunk in reverie , his body present , his spirit far away .
Parsing [sent. 2299 len. 7]: A pang shot through my heart .
Parsing [sent. 2300 len. 8]: Could the wicked device have told already ?
Parsing [sent. 2301 len. 31]: `` May I ask , uncle , '' I said , and tried hard to keep my voice steady , `` how you mean to answer this vile epistle ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2302 len. 24]: He looked up with a wan smile , such as might have broke from Lazarus when he found himself again in his body .
Parsing [sent. 2303 len. 14]: `` I will take it to the young man , '' he answered .
Parsing [sent. 2304 len. 12]: `` Please , let us go at once then , uncle !
Parsing [sent. 2305 len. 7]: I can not sit still . ''
Parsing [sent. 2306 len. 12]: He rose , and we went together to John 's room .
Parsing [sent. 2307 len. 19]: He was much better -- sitting up in bed , and eating the breakfast Penny had carried him .
Parsing [sent. 2308 len. 18]: `` I have just had a letter from your mother , Day , '' said my uncle .
Parsing [sent. 2309 len. 4]: `` Indeed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2310 len. 4]: returned John dryly .
Parsing [sent. 2311 len. 19]: `` Will you read it , and tell me what answer you would like me to return . ''
Parsing [sent. 2312 len. 16]: `` Hardly like her usual writing -- though there 's her own strange S ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2313 len. 8]: remarked John as he looked at it .
Parsing [sent. 2314 len. 11]: `` Does she always make an S like that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2315 len. 14]: asked my uncle , with something peculiar in his tone , I thought .
Parsing [sent. 2316 len. 12]: `` Always -- like a snake just going to strike . ''
Parsing [sent. 2317 len. 8]: My uncle 's face grew ghastly pale .
Parsing [sent. 2318 len. 30]: He almost snatched the letter from John 's hand , looked at it , gave it back to him , and , to our dismay , left the room .
Parsing [sent. 2319 len. 10]: `` What can be the matter , John ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2320 len. 9]: I said , my heart sinking within me .
Parsing [sent. 2321 len. 9]: `` Go to him , '' said John .
Parsing [sent. 2322 len. 4]: I dared not .
Parsing [sent. 2323 len. 32]: I had often seen him _ like _ that before walking out into the night ; but there was something in his face now which I had not seen there before .
Parsing [sent. 2324 len. 11]: It looked as if some terrible suspicion were suddenly confirmed .
Parsing [sent. 2325 len. 10]: `` You see what my mother is after ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2326 len. 3]: said John .
Parsing [sent. 2327 len. 40]: `` You have now to believe _ her _ , that I am subject to fits of insanity , or to believe _ me _ , that there is nothing she will not do to get her way . ''
Parsing [sent. 2328 len. 10]: `` Her object is clear , '' I replied .
Parsing [sent. 2329 len. 17]: `` But if she thinks to fool my uncle , she will find herself mistaken ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2330 len. 15]: `` She hopes to fool both you and your uncle , '' he rejoined .
Parsing [sent. 2331 len. 30]: `` The only wise thing I could do , she will handle so as to convince any expert of my madness -- I mean , my coming to you !
Parsing [sent. 2332 len. 19]: My reasons will go for nothing -- less than no-thing -- with any one she chooses to bewitch .
Parsing [sent. 2333 len. 14]: She will look at me with an anxious love no doctor could doubt .
Parsing [sent. 2334 len. 26]: No one can know _ you _ do not know that I am not mad -- or at least subject to attacks of madness ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2335 len. 11]: `` Oh , John , do n't frighten me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2336 len. 3]: I cried .
Parsing [sent. 2337 len. 3]: `` There !
Parsing [sent. 2338 len. 8]: you are not sure about it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2339 len. 59]: It seemed cruel of him to tease me so ; but I saw presently why he did it : he thought his mother 's letter had waked a doubt in my uncle ; and he wanted me not to be vexed with my uncle , even if he deserted him and went over to his mother 's side .
Parsing [sent. 2340 len. 10]: `` I love your uncle , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2341 len. 9]: `` I know he is a true man !
Parsing [sent. 2342 len. 16]: I _ will _ not be angry with him if my mother do mislead him .
Parsing [sent. 2343 len. 11]: The time will come when he will know the truth .
Parsing [sent. 2344 len. 6]: It must appear at last !
Parsing [sent. 2345 len. 12]: I shall have to fight her alone , that 's all !
Parsing [sent. 2346 len. 18]: The worst is , if he thinks with my mother I shall have to go at once !
Parsing [sent. 2347 len. 12]: -- If only somebody would sell my horse for me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2348 len. 25]: I guessed that his mother kept him short of money , and remembered with gladness that I was not quite penniless at the moment .
Parsing [sent. 2349 len. 20]: `` In the meantime , you must keep as quiet as you can , John , '' I said .
Parsing [sent. 2350 len. 13]: `` Where is the good of planning upon an _ if _ ?
Parsing [sent. 2351 len. 10]: To trust is to get ready , uncle says .
Parsing [sent. 2352 len. 7]: Trust is better than foresight . ''
Parsing [sent. 2353 len. 6]: John required little such persuading .
Parsing [sent. 2354 len. 16]: And indeed something very different was in my uncle 's mind from what John feared .
Parsing [sent. 2355 len. 13]: Presently I caught a glimpse of him riding out of the yard .
Parsing [sent. 2356 len. 26]: I ran to a window from which I could see the edge of the moor , and saw him cross it at an uphill gallop .
Parsing [sent. 2357 len. 18]: He was gone about four hours , and on his return went straight to his own room .
Parsing [sent. 2358 len. 19]: Not until nine o'clock did I go to him , and then he came with me to supper .
Parsing [sent. 2359 len. 12]: He looked worn , but was kind and genial as usual .
Parsing [sent. 2360 len. 32]: After supper he sent for Dick , and told him to ride to Rising , the first thing in the morning , with a letter he would find on the hall-table .
Parsing [sent. 2361 len. 13]: The letter he read to us before we parted for the night .
Parsing [sent. 2362 len. 8]: It was all we could have wished .
Parsing [sent. 2363 len. 29]: He wrote that he must not have any one in his house interfered with ; so long as a man was his guest , he was his servant .
Parsing [sent. 2364 len. 36]: Her ladyship had , however , a perfect right to see her son , and would be welcome ; only the decision as to his going or remaining must rest with the young man himself .
Parsing [sent. 2365 len. 12]: If he chose to accompany his mother , well and good !
Parsing [sent. 2366 len. 9]: though he should be sorry to lose him .
Parsing [sent. 2367 len. 17]: If he declined to return with her , he and his house continued at his service .
Parsing [sent. 2368 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXIV .
Parsing [sent. 2369 len. 4]: HAND TO HAND .
Parsing [sent. 2370 len. 10]: We looked for lady Cairnedge all the next day .
Parsing [sent. 2371 len. 24]: John was up by noon , and ready to receive her in the drawing-room ; he would not see her in his bedroom .
Parsing [sent. 2372 len. 11]: But the hours passed , and she did not come .
Parsing [sent. 2373 len. 40]: In the evening , however , when the twilight was thickening , and already all was dark in the alleys of the garden , her carriage drove quietly up -- with a startling scramble of arrest at the door .
Parsing [sent. 2374 len. 13]: The same servants were outside , and a very handsome dame within .
Parsing [sent. 2375 len. 26]: As she descended , I saw that she was tall , and , if rather stout , not stouter than suited her age and style .
Parsing [sent. 2376 len. 12]: Her face was pale , but she seemed in perfect health .
Parsing [sent. 2377 len. 18]: When I saw her closer , I found her features the most regular I had ever seen .
Parsing [sent. 2378 len. 18]: Had the soul within it filled the mould of that face , it would have been beautiful .
Parsing [sent. 2379 len. 13]: As it was , it was only handsome -- to me repulsive .
Parsing [sent. 2380 len. 17]: The moment I saw it , I knew myself in the presence of a masked battery .
Parsing [sent. 2381 len. 26]: My uncle had insisted that she should be received where we usually sat , and had given Penny orders to show her into the hall-kitchen .
Parsing [sent. 2382 len. 10]: I was alone there , preparing something for John .
Parsing [sent. 2383 len. 17]: We were not expecting her , for it seemed now too late to look for her .
Parsing [sent. 2384 len. 14]: My uncle was in the study , and Martha somewhere about the house .
Parsing [sent. 2385 len. 24]: My heart sank as I turned from the window , and sank yet lower when she appeared in the doorway of the kitchen .
Parsing [sent. 2386 len. 20]: But as I advanced , I caught sight of my uncle , and went boldly to meet the enemy .
Parsing [sent. 2387 len. 36]: He had come down his stair , and had just stepped into a clear blaze of light , which that moment burst from the wood I had some time ago laid damp upon the fire .
Parsing [sent. 2388 len. 17]: The next instant I saw the lady 's countenance ghastly with terror , looking beyond me .
Parsing [sent. 2389 len. 14]: I turned , but saw nothing , save that my uncle had disappeared .
Parsing [sent. 2390 len. 14]: When I faced her again , only a shadow of her fright remained .
Parsing [sent. 2391 len. 20]: I offered her my hand -- for she was John 's mother , but she did not take it .
Parsing [sent. 2392 len. 9]: She stood scanning me from head to foot .
Parsing [sent. 2393 len. 10]: `` I am lady Cairnedge , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 2394 len. 7]: `` Where is my son ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2395 len. 5]: I turned yet again .
Parsing [sent. 2396 len. 7]: My uncle had not come back .
Parsing [sent. 2397 len. 9]: I was not prepared to take his part .
Parsing [sent. 2398 len. 4]: I was bewildered .
Parsing [sent. 2399 len. 5]: A dead silence fell .
Parsing [sent. 2400 len. 26]: For the first time in my life , my uncle seemed to have deserted me , and at the moment when most I needed him !
Parsing [sent. 2401 len. 24]: I turned once more to the lady , and said , hardly knowing what , `` You wish to see Mr. Day ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2402 len. 8]: She answered me with a cold stare .
Parsing [sent. 2403 len. 28]: `` I will go and tell him you are here , '' I faltered ; and passing her , I sped along the passage to the drawing-room .
Parsing [sent. 2404 len. 4]: `` John ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2405 len. 11]: I cried , bursting in , `` she 's come !
Parsing [sent. 2406 len. 8]: Do you still mean to see her ?
Parsing [sent. 2407 len. 4]: Are you able ?
Parsing [sent. 2408 len. 25]: Uncle -- '' There I stopped , for his eyes were stern , and not looking at me , but at something behind me .
Parsing [sent. 2409 len. 23]: One moment I thought his fever had returned , but following his gaze I looked round : -- there stood lady Cairnedge !
Parsing [sent. 2410 len. 19]: John was face to face with his mother , and my uncle was not there to defend him !
Parsing [sent. 2411 len. 6]: `` Are you ready ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2412 len. 7]: she said , nor pretended greeting .
Parsing [sent. 2413 len. 9]: She seemed slightly discomposed , and in haste .
Parsing [sent. 2414 len. 35]: I was by this time well aware of my lover 's determination of character , but I was not prepared for the tone in which he addressed the icy woman calling herself his mother .
Parsing [sent. 2415 len. 11]: `` I am ready to listen , '' he answered .
Parsing [sent. 2416 len. 4]: `` John ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2417 len. 16]: she returned , with mingled severity and sharpness , `` let us have no masquerading !
Parsing [sent. 2418 len. 15]: You are perfectly fit to come home , and you must come at once .
Parsing [sent. 2419 len. 8]: The carriage is at the door . ''
Parsing [sent. 2420 len. 25]: `` You are quite right , mother , '' answered John calmly ; `` I _ am _ fit to go home with you .
Parsing [sent. 2421 len. 9]: But Rising does not quite agree with me .
Parsing [sent. 2422 len. 14]: I dread such another attack , and do not mean to go . ''
Parsing [sent. 2423 len. 16]: The drawing-room had a rectangular bay-window , one of whose three sides commanded the door .
Parsing [sent. 2424 len. 11]: The opposite side looked into a little grove of larches .
Parsing [sent. 2425 len. 11]: Lady Cairnedge had already realized the position of the room .
Parsing [sent. 2426 len. 16]: She darted to the window , and saw her carriage but a few yards away .
Parsing [sent. 2427 len. 14]: She would have thrown up the sash , but found she could not .
Parsing [sent. 2428 len. 16]: She twisted her handkerchief round her gloved hand , and dashed it through a pane .
Parsing [sent. 2429 len. 4]: `` Men ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2430 len. 16]: she cried , in a loud , commanding voice , `` come at once . ''
Parsing [sent. 2431 len. 32]: The moment she went to the window , I sprang to the door , locked it , put the key in my pocket , and set my back to the door .
Parsing [sent. 2432 len. 9]: I heard the men thundering at the hall-door .
Parsing [sent. 2433 len. 32]: Lady Cairnedge turned as if she would herself go and open to them , but seeing me , she understood what I had done , and went back to the window .
Parsing [sent. 2434 len. 4]: `` Come here !
Parsing [sent. 2435 len. 10]: Come to me here -- to the window ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2436 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 2437 len. 11]: John had been watching with a calm , determined look .
Parsing [sent. 2438 len. 7]: He came and stood between us .
Parsing [sent. 2439 len. 15]: `` John , '' I said , `` leave your mother to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2440 len. 7]: `` She will kill you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2441 len. 3]: he answered .
Parsing [sent. 2442 len. 7]: `` You might kill her ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2443 len. 3]: I replied .
Parsing [sent. 2444 len. 25]: I darted to the chimney , where a clear fire was burning , caught up the poker , and thrust it between the bars .
Parsing [sent. 2445 len. 7]: `` That 's for you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2446 len. 3]: I whispered .
Parsing [sent. 2447 len. 12]: `` They will not touch you with that in your hand !
Parsing [sent. 2448 len. 4]: Never mind me .
Parsing [sent. 2449 len. 18]: If your mother move hand or foot to help them , it will be my turn ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2450 len. 14]: He gave me a smile and a nod , and his eyes lightened .
Parsing [sent. 2451 len. 15]: I saw that he trusted me , and I felt fearless as a bull-dog .
Parsing [sent. 2452 len. 26]: In the meantime , she had spoken to her servants , and was now trying to open the window , which had a peculiar catch .
Parsing [sent. 2453 len. 17]: I saw that John could defend himself much better at the window than in the room .
Parsing [sent. 2454 len. 28]: I went softly behind his mother , put my hands round her neck , and clasping them in front , pulled her backward with all my strength .
Parsing [sent. 2455 len. 24]: We fell on the floor together , I under of course , but clutching as if all my soul were in my fingers .
Parsing [sent. 2456 len. 15]: Neither should she meddle with John , nor should he lay hand on her !
Parsing [sent. 2457 len. 12]: I did not mind much what I did to her myself .
Parsing [sent. 2458 len. 18]: `` To the window , John , '' I cried , `` and break their heads ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2459 len. 31]: He snatched the poker from the fire , and the next moment I heard a crashing of glass , but of course I could not see what was going on .
Parsing [sent. 2460 len. 18]: Mine was no grand way of fighting , but what was dignity where John was in danger !
Parsing [sent. 2461 len. 55]: For the moment I had the advantage , but , while determined to hold on to the last , I feared she would get the better of me , for she was much bigger and stronger , and crushed and kicked , and dug her elbows into me , struggling like a mad woman .
Parsing [sent. 2462 len. 12]: All at once the tug of her hands on mine ceased .
Parsing [sent. 2463 len. 15]: She gave a great shriek , and I felt a shudder go through her .
Parsing [sent. 2464 len. 5]: Then she lay still .
Parsing [sent. 2465 len. 12]: I relaxed my hold cautiously , for I feared a trick .
Parsing [sent. 2466 len. 5]: She did not move .
Parsing [sent. 2467 len. 11]: Horror seized me ; I thought I had killed her .
Parsing [sent. 2468 len. 8]: I writhed from under her to see .
Parsing [sent. 2469 len. 28]: As I did so , I caught sight of the pale face of my uncle , looking in at that part of the window next the larch-grove .
Parsing [sent. 2470 len. 39]: Immediately I remembered lady Cairnedge 's terror in the kitchen , and knew that the cause of it , and of her present cry , must be the same , to wit , the sight of my uncle .
Parsing [sent. 2471 len. 6]: I had not hurt her !
Parsing [sent. 2472 len. 40]: I was not yet on my feet when my uncle left the window , flew to the other side of it , and fell upon the men with a stick so furiously that he drove them to the carriage .
Parsing [sent. 2473 len. 14]: The horses took fright , and went prancing about , rearing and jibbing .
Parsing [sent. 2474 len. 16]: At the call of the coachman , two of the men flew to their heads .
Parsing [sent. 2475 len. 8]: I saw no more of their assailant .
Parsing [sent. 2476 len. 32]: John , who had not got a fair blow at one of his besiegers , left the window , and came to me where I was trying to restore his mother .
Parsing [sent. 2477 len. 28]: The third man , the butler , came back to the window , put his hand through , undid the catch , and flung the sash wide .
Parsing [sent. 2478 len. 14]: John caught up the poker from the floor , and darted to it .
Parsing [sent. 2479 len. 22]: `` Set foot within the window , Parker , '' he cried , `` and I will break your head . ''
Parsing [sent. 2480 len. 19]: The man did not believe he would hurt him , and put foot and head through the window .
Parsing [sent. 2481 len. 35]: Now John had honestly threatened , but to perform he found harder than he had thought : it is one thing to raise a poker , and another to strike a head with it .
Parsing [sent. 2482 len. 43]: The window was narrow , and the whole man was not yet in the room , when John raised his weapon ; but he could not bring the horrid poker down upon the dumb blind back of the stooping man 's head .
Parsing [sent. 2483 len. 20]: He threw it from him , and casting his eyes about , spied a huge family-bible on a side-table .
Parsing [sent. 2484 len. 14]: He sprang to it , and caught it up -- just in time .
Parsing [sent. 2485 len. 39]: The man had got one foot firm on the floor , and was slowly drawing in the other , when down came the bible on his head , with all the force John could add to its weight .
Parsing [sent. 2486 len. 8]: The butler tumbled senseless on the floor .
Parsing [sent. 2487 len. 6]: `` Here , Orbie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2488 len. 23]: cried John ; `` help me to bundle him out before he comes to himself -- Take what you would have ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2489 len. 14]: he said , as between us we shoved him out on the gravel .
Parsing [sent. 2490 len. 33]: I fetched smelling-salts and brandy , and everything I could think of -- fetched Martha too , and between us we got her on the sofa , but lady Cairnedge lay motionless .
Parsing [sent. 2491 len. 11]: She breathed indeed , but did not open her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2492 len. 16]: John stood ready to do anything for her , but his countenance revealed little compassion .
Parsing [sent. 2493 len. 33]: Whatever the cause of his mother 's swoon -- he had never seen her in one before -- he was certain it had to do with some bad passage in her life .
Parsing [sent. 2494 len. 9]: He said so to me that same evening .
Parsing [sent. 2495 len. 16]: `` But what could the sight of my uncle have to do with it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2496 len. 3]: I asked .
Parsing [sent. 2497 len. 16]: `` Probably he knows something , or she thinks he does , '' he answered .
Parsing [sent. 2498 len. 21]: `` Would n't it be better to put her to bed , and send for the doctor , John ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2499 len. 5]: I suggested at last .
Parsing [sent. 2500 len. 43]: Perhaps the sound of my voice calling her son by his Christian name , stung her proud ear , for the same moment she sat up , passed her hands over her eyes , and cast a scared gaze about the room .
Parsing [sent. 2501 len. 5]: `` Where am I ?
Parsing [sent. 2502 len. 5]: Is it gone ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2503 len. 6]: she murmured , looking ghastly .
Parsing [sent. 2504 len. 5]: No one answered her .
Parsing [sent. 2505 len. 13]: `` Call Parker , '' she said , feebly , yet imperiously .
Parsing [sent. 2506 len. 5]: Still no one spoke .
Parsing [sent. 2507 len. 19]: She kept glancing sideways at the window , where nothing was to be seen but the gathering night .
Parsing [sent. 2508 len. 21]: In a few moments she rose and walked straight from the room , erect , but white as a corpse .
Parsing [sent. 2509 len. 11]: I followed , passed her , and opened the hall-door .
Parsing [sent. 2510 len. 28]: There stood the carriage , waiting , as if nothing unusual had happened , Parker seated in the rumble , with one of the footmen beside him .
Parsing [sent. 2511 len. 8]: The other man stood by the carriage-door .
Parsing [sent. 2512 len. 21]: He opened it immediately ; her ladyship stepped in , and dropped on the seat ; the carriage rolled away .
Parsing [sent. 2513 len. 6]: I went back to John .
Parsing [sent. 2514 len. 9]: `` I must leave you , darling ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2515 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 2516 len. 14]: `` I can not subject you to the risk of such another outrage !
Parsing [sent. 2517 len. 15]: I fear sometimes my mother may be what she would have you think me .
Parsing [sent. 2518 len. 11]: I ought to have said , I hope she is .
Parsing [sent. 2519 len. 11]: It would be the only possible excuse for her behaviour .
Parsing [sent. 2520 len. 15]: The natural end of loving one 's own way , is to go mad .
Parsing [sent. 2521 len. 27]: If you do n't get it , you go mad ; if you do get it , you go madder -- that 's all the difference !
Parsing [sent. 2522 len. 6]: -- I must go ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2523 len. 14]: I tried to expostulate with him , but it was of no use .
Parsing [sent. 2524 len. 7]: `` Where will you go ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2525 len. 3]: I said .
Parsing [sent. 2526 len. 8]: `` You can not go home ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2527 len. 22]: `` I would at once , '' he answered , `` if I could take the reins in my own hands .
Parsing [sent. 2528 len. 12]: But I will go to London , and see the family-lawyer .
Parsing [sent. 2529 len. 11]: He will tell me what I had better do . ''
Parsing [sent. 2530 len. 7]: `` You have no money ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2531 len. 3]: I said .
Parsing [sent. 2532 len. 8]: `` How do you know that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2533 len. 6]: he returned with a smile .
Parsing [sent. 2534 len. 9]: `` Have you been searching my pockets ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2535 len. 4]: `` John ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2536 len. 3]: I cried .
Parsing [sent. 2537 len. 7]: He broke into a merry laugh .
Parsing [sent. 2538 len. 13]: `` Your uncle will lend me a five-pound-note , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2539 len. 26]: `` He will lend you as much as you want ; but I do n't think he 's in the house , '' I answered .
Parsing [sent. 2540 len. 8]: `` I have two myself , though !
Parsing [sent. 2541 len. 8]: I 'll run and fetch them . ''
Parsing [sent. 2542 len. 8]: I bounded away to get the notes .
Parsing [sent. 2543 len. 15]: It was like having a common purse already , to lend John ten pounds !
Parsing [sent. 2544 len. 35]: But I had no intention of letting him leave the house the same day he was first out of his room after such an illness -- that was , if I could help it .
Parsing [sent. 2545 len. 65]: My uncle had given me the use of a drawer in that same cabinet in which were the precious stones ; and there , partly , I think , from the pride of sharing the cabinet with my uncle , I had long kept everything I counted precious : I should have kept Zoe there if she had not been alive and too big !
Parsing [sent. 2546 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXV .
Parsing [sent. 2547 len. 5]: A VERY STRANGE THING .
Parsing [sent. 2548 len. 34]: The moment I opened the door of the study , I saw my uncle -- in his think-chair , his head against the back of it , his face turned to the ceiling .
Parsing [sent. 2549 len. 16]: I ran to his side and dropped on my knees , thinking he was dead .
Parsing [sent. 2550 len. 27]: He opened his eyes and looked at me , but with such a wan , woe-begone countenance , that I burst into a passion of tears .
Parsing [sent. 2551 len. 9]: `` What is it , uncle dear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2552 len. 5]: I gasped and sobbed .
Parsing [sent. 2553 len. 12]: `` Nothing very new , little one , '' he answered .
Parsing [sent. 2554 len. 21]: `` It is something terrible , uncle , '' I cried , `` or you would not look like that !
Parsing [sent. 2555 len. 7]: Did those horrid men hurt you ?
Parsing [sent. 2556 len. 7]: You did give it them well !
Parsing [sent. 2557 len. 13]: You came down on them like the angel on the Assyrians ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2558 len. 15]: `` I do n't know what you 're talking about , little one ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2559 len. 3]: he returned .
Parsing [sent. 2560 len. 5]: `` What men ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2561 len. 14]: `` The men that came with John 's mother to carry him off .
Parsing [sent. 2562 len. 17]: If it had n't been for my beautiful uncle , they would have done it too !
Parsing [sent. 2563 len. 9]: How I wondered what had become of you !
Parsing [sent. 2564 len. 6]: I was almost in despair .
Parsing [sent. 2565 len. 23]: I thought you had left us to ourselves -- and you only waiting , like God , for the right moment ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2566 len. 11]: He sat up , and stared at me , bewildered .
Parsing [sent. 2567 len. 9]: `` I had forgotten all about John ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2568 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 2569 len. 15]: `` As to what you think I did , I know nothing about it .
Parsing [sent. 2570 len. 19]: I have n't been out of this room since I saw -- that spectre in the kitchen . ''
Parsing [sent. 2571 len. 11]: `` John 's mother , you mean , uncle ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2572 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 2573 len. 9]: she 's John 's mother , is she ?
Parsing [sent. 2574 len. 18]: Yes , I thought as much -- and it was more than my poor brain could stand !
Parsing [sent. 2575 len. 5]: It was too terrible !
Parsing [sent. 2576 len. 14]: -- My little one , this is death to you and me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2577 len. 6]: My heart sank within me .
Parsing [sent. 2578 len. 34]: One thought only went through my head -- that , come what might , I would no more give up John , than if I were already married to him in the church .
Parsing [sent. 2579 len. 11]: `` But why -- what is it , uncle ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2580 len. 11]: I said , hardly able to get the words out .
Parsing [sent. 2581 len. 20]: `` I will tell you another time , '' he answered , and rising , went to the door .
Parsing [sent. 2582 len. 14]: `` John is going to London , '' I said , following him .
Parsing [sent. 2583 len. 5]: `` Is he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2584 len. 4]: he returned listlessly .
Parsing [sent. 2585 len. 26]: `` He wants to see his lawyer , and try to get things on a footing of some sort between his mother and him . ''
Parsing [sent. 2586 len. 17]: `` That is very proper , '' he replied , with his hand on the lock .
Parsing [sent. 2587 len. 28]: `` But you do n't think it would be safe for him to travel to-night -- do you , uncle -- so soon after his illness ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2588 len. 3]: I asked .
Parsing [sent. 2589 len. 10]: `` No , I can not say I do .
Parsing [sent. 2590 len. 6]: It would not be safe .
Parsing [sent. 2591 len. 9]: He is welcome to stop till to-morrow . ''
Parsing [sent. 2592 len. 10]: `` Will you not tell him so , uncle ?
Parsing [sent. 2593 len. 7]: He is bent on going ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2594 len. 8]: `` I would rather not see him !
Parsing [sent. 2595 len. 5]: There is no occasion .
Parsing [sent. 2596 len. 35]: It will be a great relief to me when he is able -- quite able , I mean -- to go home to his mother -- or where it may suit him best . ''
Parsing [sent. 2597 len. 15]: It was indeed like death to hear my uncle talk so differently about John .
Parsing [sent. 2598 len. 27]: What had he done to be treated in this way -- taken up and made a friend of , and then cast off without reason given !
Parsing [sent. 2599 len. 10]: My dear uncle was not at all like himself !
Parsing [sent. 2600 len. 27]: To say he forgot our trouble and danger , and never came near us in our sore peril , when we owed our deliverance to him !
Parsing [sent. 2601 len. 9]: and now to speak like this concerning John !
Parsing [sent. 2602 len. 7]: Something was terribly wrong with him !
Parsing [sent. 2603 len. 9]: I dared hardly think what it could be .
Parsing [sent. 2604 len. 4]: I stood speechless .
Parsing [sent. 2605 len. 12]: My uncle opened the door , and went down the steps .
Parsing [sent. 2606 len. 22]: The sound of his feet along the corridor and down the stair to the kitchen , died away in my ears .
Parsing [sent. 2607 len. 9]: My life seemed to go ebbing with it .
Parsing [sent. 2608 len. 20]: I was stranded on a desert shore , and he in whom I had trusted was leaving me there !
Parsing [sent. 2609 len. 17]: I came to myself a little , got the two five-pound-notes , and returned to John .
Parsing [sent. 2610 len. 23]: When I reached the door of the room , I found my heart in my throat , and my brains upside down .
Parsing [sent. 2611 len. 8]: What was I to say to him ?
Parsing [sent. 2612 len. 10]: How could I let him go away so late ?
Parsing [sent. 2613 len. 15]: and how could I let him stay where his departure would be a relief ?
Parsing [sent. 2614 len. 13]: Even I would have him gone from where he was not wanted !
Parsing [sent. 2615 len. 28]: I saw , however , that my uncle must not have John 's death at his door -- that I must persuade him to stay the night .
Parsing [sent. 2616 len. 23]: I went in , and gave him the notes , but begged him , for my love , to go to bed .
Parsing [sent. 2617 len. 15]: In the morning , I said , I would drive him to the station .
Parsing [sent. 2618 len. 19]: He yielded with difficulty -- but with how little suspicion that all the time I wished him gone !
Parsing [sent. 2619 len. 14]: I went to bed only to lie listening for my uncle 's return .
Parsing [sent. 2620 len. 9]: It was long past midnight ere he came .
Parsing [sent. 2621 len. 45]: In the morning I sent Penny to order the phaeton , and then ran to my uncle 's room , in the hope he would want to see John before he left : I was not sure he had realized that he was going .
Parsing [sent. 2622 len. 11]: He was neither in his bed-room nor in the study .
Parsing [sent. 2623 len. 6]: I went to the stable .
Parsing [sent. 2624 len. 9]: Dick was putting the horse to the phaeton .
Parsing [sent. 2625 len. 20]: He told me he had heard his master , two hours before , saddle Thanatos , and ride away .
Parsing [sent. 2626 len. 9]: This made me yet more anxious about him .
Parsing [sent. 2627 len. 15]: He did not often ride out early -- seldom indeed after coming home late !
Parsing [sent. 2628 len. 6]: Things seemed to threaten complication !
Parsing [sent. 2629 len. 25]: John looked so much better , and was so eager after the projected interview with his lawyer , that I felt comforted concerning him .
Parsing [sent. 2630 len. 14]: I did not tell him what my uncle had said the night before .
Parsing [sent. 2631 len. 33]: It would , I felt , be wrong to mention what my uncle might wish forgotten ; and as I did not know what he meant , it could serve no end .
Parsing [sent. 2632 len. 31]: We parted at the station very much as if we had been married half a century , and I returned home to brood over the strange things that had happened .
Parsing [sent. 2633 len. 53]: But before long I found myself in a weltering swamp of futile speculation , and turned my thoughts perforce into other channels , lest I should lose the power of thinking , and be drowned in reverie : my uncle had taught me that reverie is Phaeton in the chariot of Apollo .
Parsing [sent. 2634 len. 12]: The weary hours passed , and my uncle did not come .
Parsing [sent. 2635 len. 25]: I had never before been really uneasy at his longest absence ; but now I was far more anxious about him than about John .
Parsing [sent. 2636 len. 15]: Alas , through me fresh trouble had befallen my uncle as well as John !
Parsing [sent. 2637 len. 39]: When the night came , I went to bed , for I was very tired : I must keep myself strong , for something unfriendly was on its way , and I must be able to meet it !
Parsing [sent. 2638 len. 30]: I knew well I should not sleep until I heard the sounds of his arrival : those came about one o'clock , and in a moment I was dreaming .
Parsing [sent. 2639 len. 17]: In my dream I was still awake , and still watching for my uncle 's return .
Parsing [sent. 2640 len. 35]: I heard the sound of Death 's hoofs , not on the stones of the yard , but on the gravel before the house , and coming round the house till under my window .
Parsing [sent. 2641 len. 20]: There he stopped , and I heard my uncle call to me to come down : he wanted me .
Parsing [sent. 2642 len. 40]: In my dream I was a child ; I sprang out of bed , ran from the house on my bare feet , jumped into his down-stretched arms , and was in a moment seated in front of him .
Parsing [sent. 2643 len. 30]: Death gave a great plunge , and went off like the wind , cleared the gate in a flying stride , and rushed up the hill to the heath .
Parsing [sent. 2644 len. 49]: The wind was blowing behind us furiously : I could hear it roaring , but did not feel it , for it could not overtake us ; we out-stripped and kept ahead of it ; if for a moment we slackened speed , it fell upon us raging .
Parsing [sent. 2645 len. 36]: We came at length to the pool near the heart of the heath , and I wondered that , at the speed we were making , we had been such a time in reaching it .
Parsing [sent. 2646 len. 19]: It was the dismalest spot , with its crumbling peaty banks , and its water brown as tea .
Parsing [sent. 2647 len. 12]: Tradition declared it had no bottom -- went down into nowhere .
Parsing [sent. 2648 len. 37]: `` Here , '' said my uncle , bringing his horse to a sudden halt , `` we had a terrible battle once , Death and I , with the worm that lives in this hole .
Parsing [sent. 2649 len. 12]: You know what worm it is , do you not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2650 len. 56]: I had heard of the worm , and any time I happened , in galloping about the heath , to find myself near the pool , the thought would always come back with a fresh shudder -- what if the legend were a true one , and the worm was down there biding his time !
Parsing [sent. 2651 len. 11]: but anything more about the worm I had never heard .
Parsing [sent. 2652 len. 20]: `` No , uncle , '' I answered ; `` I do n't know what worm it is . ''
Parsing [sent. 2653 len. 42]: `` Ah , '' he answered , with a sigh , `` if you do not take the more care , little one , you will some day learn , not what the worm is called , but what it is !
Parsing [sent. 2654 len. 14]: The worm that lives there , is the worm that never dies . ''
Parsing [sent. 2655 len. 22]: I gave a shriek ; I had never heard of the horrible creature before -- so it seemed in my dream .
Parsing [sent. 2656 len. 17]: To think of its being so near us , and never dying , was too terrible .
Parsing [sent. 2657 len. 20]: `` Do n't be frightened , little one , '' he said , pressing me closer to his bosom .
Parsing [sent. 2658 len. 7]: `` Death and I killed it .
Parsing [sent. 2659 len. 21]: Come with me to the other side , and you will see it lying there , stiff and stark . ''
Parsing [sent. 2660 len. 29]: `` But , uncle , '' I said , `` how can it be dead -- how can you have killed it , if it never dies ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2661 len. 9]: `` Ah , that is the mystery ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2662 len. 3]: he returned .
Parsing [sent. 2663 len. 6]: `` But come and see .
Parsing [sent. 2664 len. 6]: It was a terrible fight .
Parsing [sent. 2665 len. 13]: I never had such a fight -- or dear old Death either .
Parsing [sent. 2666 len. 6]: But she 's dead now !
Parsing [sent. 2667 len. 15]: It was worth living for , to make away with such a monster ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2668 len. 20]: We rode round the pool , cautiously because of the crumbling banks , to see the worm lie dead .
Parsing [sent. 2669 len. 6]: On and on we rode .
Parsing [sent. 2670 len. 14]: I began to think we must have ridden many times round the hole .
Parsing [sent. 2671 len. 11]: `` I wonder where it can be , uncle ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2672 len. 5]: I said at length .
Parsing [sent. 2673 len. 13]: `` We shall come to it very soon , '' he answered .
Parsing [sent. 2674 len. 20]: `` But , '' I said , `` may n't we have ridden past it without seeing it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2675 len. 8]: He laughed a loud and terrible laugh .
Parsing [sent. 2676 len. 32]: `` When once you have seen it , little one , '' he replied , `` you too will laugh at the notion of having ridden past it without seeing it .
Parsing [sent. 2677 len. 14]: The worm that never dies is hardly a thing to escape notice ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2678 len. 6]: We rode on and on .
Parsing [sent. 2679 len. 23]: All at once my uncle threw up his hands , dropping the reins , and with a fearful cry covered his face .
Parsing [sent. 2680 len. 5]: `` It is gone !
Parsing [sent. 2681 len. 6]: I have not killed it !
Parsing [sent. 2682 len. 6]: No , I have not !
Parsing [sent. 2683 len. 4]: It is here !
Parsing [sent. 2684 len. 5]: it is here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2685 len. 10]: he cried , pressing his hand to his heart .
Parsing [sent. 2686 len. 17]: `` It is here , and it was here all the time I thought it dead !
Parsing [sent. 2687 len. 6]: What will become of me !
Parsing [sent. 2688 len. 7]: I am lost , lost ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2689 len. 31]: At the word , old Death gave a scream , and laying himself out , flew with all the might of his swift limbs to get away from the place .
Parsing [sent. 2690 len. 55]: But the wind , which was behind us as we came , now stormed in our faces ; and presently I saw we should never reach home , for , with all Death 's fierce endeavour , we moved but an inch or two in the minute , and that with a killing struggle .
Parsing [sent. 2691 len. 22]: `` Little one , '' said my uncle , `` if you do n't get down we shall all be lost .
Parsing [sent. 2692 len. 6]: I feel the worm rising .
Parsing [sent. 2693 len. 14]: It is your weight that keeps poor Death from making any progress . ''
Parsing [sent. 2694 len. 17]: I turned my head , leaning past my uncle , so as to see behind him .
Parsing [sent. 2695 len. 25]: A long neck , surmounted by a head of indescribable horror , was slowly rising straight up out of the middle of the pool .
Parsing [sent. 2696 len. 6]: It should not catch them !
Parsing [sent. 2697 len. 9]: I slid down by my uncle 's leg .
Parsing [sent. 2698 len. 23]: The moment I touched the ground and let go , away went Death , and in an instant was out of sight .
Parsing [sent. 2699 len. 5]: I was not afraid .
Parsing [sent. 2700 len. 21]: My heart was lifted up with the thought that I was going to die for my uncle and old Death .
Parsing [sent. 2701 len. 8]: The red worm was on the bank .
Parsing [sent. 2702 len. 6]: It was crawling toward me .
Parsing [sent. 2703 len. 6]: I went to meet it .
Parsing [sent. 2704 len. 17]: It sprang from the ground , threw itself upon me , and twisted itself about me .
Parsing [sent. 2705 len. 16]: It was a human embrace , the embrace of some one unknown that loved me !
Parsing [sent. 2706 len. 7]: I awoke and left the dream .
Parsing [sent. 2707 len. 7]: But the dream never left me .
Parsing [sent. 2708 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXVI .
Parsing [sent. 2709 len. 5]: THE EVIL DRAWS NIGHER .
Parsing [sent. 2710 len. 12]: I rose early , and went to my uncle 's room .
Parsing [sent. 2711 len. 9]: He was awake , but complained of headache .
Parsing [sent. 2712 len. 15]: I took him a cup of tea , and at his request left him .
Parsing [sent. 2713 len. 15]: About noon Martha brought me a letter where I sat alone in the drawing-room .
Parsing [sent. 2714 len. 7]: I carried it to my uncle .
Parsing [sent. 2715 len. 19]: He took it with a trembling hand , read it , and fell back with his eyes closed .
Parsing [sent. 2716 len. 5]: I ran for brandy .
Parsing [sent. 2717 len. 15]: `` Do n't be frightened , little one , '' he called after me .
Parsing [sent. 2718 len. 8]: `` I do n't want anything . ''
Parsing [sent. 2719 len. 14]: `` Wo n't you tell me what is the matter , uncle ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2720 len. 5]: I said , returning .
Parsing [sent. 2721 len. 11]: `` Is it necessary I should be kept ignorant ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2722 len. 10]: `` Not at all , my little one . ''
Parsing [sent. 2723 len. 45]: `` Do n't you think , uncle , '' I dared to continue , forgetting in my love all difference of years , `` that , whatever it be that troubles us , it must be better those who love us should know it ?
Parsing [sent. 2724 len. 11]: Is there some good in a secret after all ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2725 len. 10]: `` None , my darling , '' he answered .
Parsing [sent. 2726 len. 40]: `` The thing that made me talk to you so against secrets when you were a child , was , that I had one myself -- one that was , and is , eating the heart out of me .
Parsing [sent. 2727 len. 11]: But that woman shall not know and you be ignorant !
Parsing [sent. 2728 len. 10]: I will not have a secret with _ her !
Parsing [sent. 2729 len. 12]: _ -- Leave me now , please , little one . ''
Parsing [sent. 2730 len. 5]: I rose at once .
Parsing [sent. 2731 len. 12]: `` May I take the letter with me , uncle ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2732 len. 3]: I asked .
Parsing [sent. 2733 len. 10]: He rubbed his forehead with a still trembling hand .
Parsing [sent. 2734 len. 33]: The trembling of that beloved hand filled me with such a divine sense of pity , that for the first time I seemed to know God , causing in me that consciousness !
Parsing [sent. 2735 len. 12]: The whole human mother was roused in me for my uncle .
Parsing [sent. 2736 len. 11]: I would die , I would kill to save him !
Parsing [sent. 2737 len. 8]: The worm was welcome to swallow me !
Parsing [sent. 2738 len. 18]: My very being was a well of loving pity , pouring itself out over that trembling hand .
Parsing [sent. 2739 len. 20]: He took up the letter , gave it to me , and turned his face away with a groan .
Parsing [sent. 2740 len. 14]: I left the room in strange exaltation -- the exaltation of merest love .
Parsing [sent. 2741 len. 13]: I went to the study , and there read the hateful letter .
Parsing [sent. 2742 len. 4]: Here it is .
Parsing [sent. 2743 len. 9]: Having transcribed it , I shall destroy it .
Parsing [sent. 2744 len. 28]: `` Sir , -- For one who persists in coming between a woman and her son , who will blame the mother if she cast aside forbearance !
Parsing [sent. 2745 len. 15]: I would have spared you as hitherto ; I will spare you no longer .
Parsing [sent. 2746 len. 22]: You little thought when you crossed me who I was -- the one in the world in whose power you lay !
Parsing [sent. 2747 len. 17]: I would perish ever-lastingly rather than permit one of my blood to marry one of yours .
Parsing [sent. 2748 len. 22]: My words are strong ; you are welcome to call them unladylike ; but you shall not doubt what I mean .
Parsing [sent. 2749 len. 39]: You know perfectly that , if I denounce you as a murderer , I can prove what I say ; and as to my silence for so many years , I am able thoroughly to account for it .
Parsing [sent. 2750 len. 8]: I shall give you no further warning .
Parsing [sent. 2751 len. 24]: You know where my son is : if he is not in my house within two days , I shall have you arrested .
Parsing [sent. 2752 len. 8]: _ I have made up my mind .
Parsing [sent. 2753 len. 5]: _ `` Lucretia Cairnedge .
Parsing [sent. 2754 len. 10]: `` Rising-Manor , July 15 , 18 -- . ''
Parsing [sent. 2755 len. 14]: `` Whoever be the father , she 's the mother of lies ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2756 len. 3]: I exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 2757 len. 16]: -- `` My uncle -- the best and gentlest of men , a murderer ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2758 len. 9]: I laughed aloud in my indignation and wrath .
Parsing [sent. 2759 len. 21]: But , though the woman was a liar , she must have something to say with a show of truth !
Parsing [sent. 2760 len. 11]: How else would she dare intimidation with such a man ?
Parsing [sent. 2761 len. 12]: How else could her threat have so wrought upon my uncle ?
Parsing [sent. 2762 len. 10]: What did she know , or imagine she knew ?
Parsing [sent. 2763 len. 12]: What could be the something on which she founded her lie ?
Parsing [sent. 2764 len. 18]: -- That my uncle was going to tell me , nor did I dread hearing his story .
Parsing [sent. 2765 len. 9]: No revelation would lower him in my eyes !
Parsing [sent. 2766 len. 6]: Of that I was confident .
Parsing [sent. 2767 len. 22]: But I little thought how long it would be before it came , or what a terrible tale it would prove .
Parsing [sent. 2768 len. 13]: I ran down the stair with the vile paper in my hand .
Parsing [sent. 2769 len. 6]: `` The wicked woman ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2770 len. 3]: I cried .
Parsing [sent. 2771 len. 24]: `` If she _ be _ John 's mother , I do n't care : she 's a devil and a liar ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2772 len. 9]: `` Hush , hush , little one ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2773 len. 28]: said my uncle , with a smile in which the sadness seemed to intensify the sweetness ; `` you do not _ know _ anything against her !
Parsing [sent. 2774 len. 12]: You do not _ know _ she is a liar ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2775 len. 13]: `` There are things , uncle , one knows without knowing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2776 len. 11]: `` What if I said she told no lie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2777 len. 14]: `` I should say she was a liar although she told no lie .
Parsing [sent. 2778 len. 13]: My uncle is not what she threatens to say he is ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2779 len. 28]: `` But men have repented , and grown so different you would not know them : how can you tell it has not been so with me ?
Parsing [sent. 2780 len. 14]: I may have been a bad man once , and grown better ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2781 len. 21]: `` I know you are trying to prepare me for what you think will be a shock , uncle ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2782 len. 10]: I answered ; `` but I want no preparing .
Parsing [sent. 2783 len. 5]: Out with your worst !
Parsing [sent. 2784 len. 5]: I defy you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2785 len. 5]: Ah me , confident !
Parsing [sent. 2786 len. 10]: But I had not to repent of my confidence !
Parsing [sent. 2787 len. 7]: My uncle gave a great sigh .
Parsing [sent. 2788 len. 14]: He looked as if there was nothing for him now but tell all .
Parsing [sent. 2789 len. 7]: Evidently he shrank from the task .
Parsing [sent. 2790 len. 31]: He put his hand over his eyes , and said slowly , -- `` You belong to a world , little one , of which you know next to nothing .
Parsing [sent. 2791 len. 11]: More than Satan have fallen as lightning from heaven ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2792 len. 13]: He lay silent so long that I was constrained to speak again .
Parsing [sent. 2793 len. 20]: `` Well , uncle dear , '' I said , `` are you not going to tell me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2794 len. 9]: `` I can not , '' he answered .
Parsing [sent. 2795 len. 14]: There was absolute silence for , I should think , about twenty minutes .
Parsing [sent. 2796 len. 11]: I could not and would not urge him to speak .
Parsing [sent. 2797 len. 10]: What right had I to rouse a killing effort !
Parsing [sent. 2798 len. 11]: He was not bound to tell _ me _ anything !
Parsing [sent. 2799 len. 19]: But I mourned the impossibility of doing my best for him , poor as that best might be .
Parsing [sent. 2800 len. 45]: `` Do not think , my darling , '' he said at last , and laid his hand on my head as I knelt beside him , `` that I have the least difficulty in trusting you ; it is only in telling you .
Parsing [sent. 2801 len. 9]: I would trust you with my eternal soul .
Parsing [sent. 2802 len. 27]: You can see well enough there is something terrible to tell , for would I not otherwise laugh to scorn the threat of that bad woman ?
Parsing [sent. 2803 len. 17]: No one on the earth has so little right to say what she knows of me .
Parsing [sent. 2804 len. 18]: Yet I do share a secret with her which feels as if it would burst my heart .
Parsing [sent. 2805 len. 5]: I wish it would .
Parsing [sent. 2806 len. 12]: That would open the one way out of all my trouble .
Parsing [sent. 2807 len. 16]: Believe me , little one , if any ever needed God , I need him .
Parsing [sent. 2808 len. 25]: I need the pardon that goes hand in hand with righteous judgment , the pardon of him who alone can make lawful excuse . ''
Parsing [sent. 2809 len. 16]: `` May God be your judge , uncle , and neither man nor woman ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2810 len. 29]: `` I do not think _ you _ would altogether condemn me , little one , much as I loathe myself -- terribly as I deserve condemnation . ''
Parsing [sent. 2811 len. 6]: `` Condemn you , uncle !
Parsing [sent. 2812 len. 18]: I want to know all , just to show you that nothing can make the least difference .
Parsing [sent. 2813 len. 27]: If you were as bad as that bad woman says , you should find there was one of your own blood who knew what love meant .
Parsing [sent. 2814 len. 16]: But I know you are good , uncle , whatever you may have done . ''
Parsing [sent. 2815 len. 13]: `` Little one , you comfort me , '' sighed my uncle .
Parsing [sent. 2816 len. 26]: `` I can not tell you this thing , for when I had told it , I should want to kill myself more than ever .
Parsing [sent. 2817 len. 12]: But neither can I bear that you should not know it .
Parsing [sent. 2818 len. 12]: I will _ not _ have a secret with that woman !
Parsing [sent. 2819 len. 9]: I have always intended to tell you everything .
Parsing [sent. 2820 len. 33]: I have the whole fearful story set down for your eyes -- and those of any you may wish to see it : I can not speak the words into your ears .
Parsing [sent. 2821 len. 21]: The paper I will give you now ; but you will not open it until I give you leave . ''
Parsing [sent. 2822 len. 7]: `` Certainly not , uncle . ''
Parsing [sent. 2823 len. 20]: `` If I should die before you have read it , I permit and desire you to read it .
Parsing [sent. 2824 len. 29]: I know your loyalty so well , that I believe you would not look at it even after my death , if I had not given you permission .
Parsing [sent. 2825 len. 18]: There are those who treat the dead as if they had no more rights of any kind .
Parsing [sent. 2826 len. 17]: ` Get away to Hades , ' they say ; ` you are nothing now . '
Parsing [sent. 2827 len. 13]: But you will not behave so to your uncle , little one !
Parsing [sent. 2828 len. 53]: When the time comes for you to read my story , remember that I _ now _ , in preparation for the knowledge that will give you , ask you to pardon me _ then _ for all the pain it will cause you and your husband -- John being that husband .
Parsing [sent. 2829 len. 30]: I have tried to do my best for you , Orbie : how much better I might have done had I had a clear conscience , God only knows .
Parsing [sent. 2830 len. 19]: It may be that I was the tenderer uncle that I could not be a better one . ''
Parsing [sent. 2831 len. 16]: He hid his face in his hands , and burst into a tempest of weeping .
Parsing [sent. 2832 len. 36]: It was terrible to see the man to whom I had all my life looked with a reverence that prepared me for knowing the great father , weeping like a bitterly repentant and self-abhorrent child .
Parsing [sent. 2833 len. 7]: It seemed sacrilege to be present .
Parsing [sent. 2834 len. 21]: I felt as if my eyes , only for seeing him thus , deserved the ravens to pick them out .
Parsing [sent. 2835 len. 6]: I could not contain myself .
Parsing [sent. 2836 len. 40]: I rose and threw my arms about him , got close to him as a child to her mother , and , as soon as the passion of my love would let me , sobbed out , `` Uncle !
Parsing [sent. 2837 len. 3]: darling uncle !
Parsing [sent. 2838 len. 7]: I love you more than ever !
Parsing [sent. 2839 len. 12]: I did not know before that I could love so much !
Parsing [sent. 2840 len. 12]: I could _ kill _ that woman with my own hands !
Parsing [sent. 2841 len. 14]: I wish I had killed her when I pulled her down that day !
Parsing [sent. 2842 len. 16]: It is right to kill poisonous creatures : she is worse than any snake ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2843 len. 12]: He smiled a sad little smile , and shook his head .
Parsing [sent. 2844 len. 9]: Then first I seemed to understand a little .
Parsing [sent. 2845 len. 7]: A dull flash went through me .
Parsing [sent. 2846 len. 12]: I stood up , drew back , and gazed at him .
Parsing [sent. 2847 len. 7]: My eyes fixed themselves on his .
Parsing [sent. 2848 len. 5]: I stared into them .
Parsing [sent. 2849 len. 14]: He had ceased to weep , and lay regarding me with calm response .
Parsing [sent. 2850 len. 11]: `` You do n't mean , uncle , -- ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2851 len. 9]: `` Yes , little one , I do .
Parsing [sent. 2852 len. 19]: That woman was the cause of the action for which she threatens to denounce me as a murderer .
Parsing [sent. 2853 len. 26]: I do not say she intended to bring it about ; but none the less was she the consciously wicked and wilful cause of it .
Parsing [sent. 2854 len. 14]: -- And you will marry her son , and be her daughter ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2855 len. 13]: he added , with a groan as of one in unutterable despair .
Parsing [sent. 2856 len. 6]: I sprang back from him .
Parsing [sent. 2857 len. 17]: My very proximity was a pollution to him while he believed such a thing of me !
Parsing [sent. 2858 len. 8]: `` Never , uncle , never ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2859 len. 3]: I cried .
Parsing [sent. 2860 len. 16]: `` How can you think so ill of one who loves you as I do !
Parsing [sent. 2861 len. 6]: I will denounce _ her !
Parsing [sent. 2862 len. 14]: _ She will be hanged , and we shall be at peace ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2863 len. 5]: `` And John ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2864 len. 4]: said my uncle .
Parsing [sent. 2865 len. 8]: `` John must look after himself ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2866 len. 4]: I answered fiercely .
Parsing [sent. 2867 len. 25]: `` Because he chooses to have such a mother , am I to bring her a hair 's - breadth nearer to my uncle !
Parsing [sent. 2868 len. 9]: Not for any man that ever was born !
Parsing [sent. 2869 len. 15]: John must discard his mother , or he and I are as we were !
Parsing [sent. 2870 len. 3]: A mother !
Parsing [sent. 2871 len. 11]: She is a hyena , a shark , a monster !
Parsing [sent. 2872 len. 8]: Uncle , she is a _ devil !
Parsing [sent. 2873 len. 7]: _ -- I do n't care !
Parsing [sent. 2874 len. 15]: It is true ; and what is true is the right thing to say .
Parsing [sent. 2875 len. 17]: I will go to her , and tell her to her face what she is ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2876 len. 8]: I turned and made for the door .
Parsing [sent. 2877 len. 11]: My heart felt as big as the biggest man 's .
Parsing [sent. 2878 len. 29]: `` If she kill you , little one , '' said my uncle quietly , `` I shall be left with nobody to take care of me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2879 len. 6]: I burst into fresh tears .
Parsing [sent. 2880 len. 13]: I saw that I was a fool , and could do nothing .
Parsing [sent. 2881 len. 4]: `` Poor John !
Parsing [sent. 2882 len. 8]: -- To have such a mother ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2883 len. 3]: I sobbed .
Parsing [sent. 2884 len. 21]: Then in a rage of rebellion I cried , `` I do n't believe she _ is _ his mother !
Parsing [sent. 2885 len. 31]: Is it possible now , uncle -- does it stand to reason , that such a pestilence of a woman should ever have borne such a child as my John ?
Parsing [sent. 2886 len. 15]: I do n't , I ca n't , I wo n't believe it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2887 len. 17]: `` I am afraid there are mysteries in the world quite as hard to explain ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2888 len. 4]: replied my uncle .
Parsing [sent. 2889 len. 29]: `` I confess , if I had known who was his mother , I should have been far from ready to yield my consent to your engagement . ''
Parsing [sent. 2890 len. 7]: `` What does it matter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2891 len. 3]: I said .
Parsing [sent. 2892 len. 10]: `` Of course I shall not marry him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2893 len. 8]: `` Not marry him , child ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2894 len. 4]: returned my uncle .
Parsing [sent. 2895 len. 7]: `` What are you thinking of ?
Parsing [sent. 2896 len. 19]: Is the poor fellow to suffer for , as well as by the sins of his mother ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2897 len. 49]: `` If you think , uncle , that I will bring you into any kind of relation with that horrible woman , if the worst of it were only that you would have to see her once because she was my husband 's mother , you are mistaken .
Parsing [sent. 2898 len. 23]: She to threaten you if you did not send back her son , as if John were a horse you had stolen !
Parsing [sent. 2899 len. 30]: You have been the angel of God about me all the days of my life , but even to please you , I can not consent to despise myself .
Parsing [sent. 2900 len. 9]: Besides , you know what she threatens ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2901 len. 7]: `` She shall not hurt me .
Parsing [sent. 2902 len. 10]: I will take care of myself for your sakes .
Parsing [sent. 2903 len. 13]: Your life shall not be clouded by scandal about your uncle . ''
Parsing [sent. 2904 len. 11]: `` How are you to prevent it , uncle dear ?
Parsing [sent. 2905 len. 14]: Fulfil her threat or not , she would be sure to talk ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2906 len. 17]: `` When she sees it can serve no purpose , she will hardly risk reprisals . ''
Parsing [sent. 2907 len. 16]: `` She will certainly not risk them when she finds we have said good-bye . ''
Parsing [sent. 2908 len. 11]: `` But how would that serve me , little one ?
Parsing [sent. 2909 len. 2]: What !
Parsing [sent. 2910 len. 21]: would you heap on your uncle 's conscience , already overburdened , the misery of keeping two lovely lovers apart ?
Parsing [sent. 2911 len. 10]: I will tell you what I have resolved upon .
Parsing [sent. 2912 len. 11]: I will have no more secrets from you , Orba .
Parsing [sent. 2913 len. 16]: Oh , how I thank you , dearest , for not casting me off ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2914 len. 11]: Again I threw myself on my knees by his bed .
Parsing [sent. 2915 len. 44]: `` Uncle , '' I cried , my heart ready to break with the effort to show itself , `` if I did not now love you more than ever , I should deserve to be cast out , and trodden under foot !
Parsing [sent. 2916 len. 9]: -- What do you think of doing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2917 len. 16]: `` I shall leave the country , not to return while the woman lives . ''
Parsing [sent. 2918 len. 29]: `` I 'm ready , uncle , '' I said , springing to my feet ; '' -- at least I shall be in a few minutes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2919 len. 30]: `` But hear me out , little one , '' he rejoined , with a smile of genuine pleasure ; `` you do n't know half my plan yet .
Parsing [sent. 2920 len. 16]: How am I to live abroad , if my property go to rack and ruin ?
Parsing [sent. 2921 len. 26]: Listen , and do n't say anything till I have done ; I have no time to lose ; I must get up at once .
Parsing [sent. 2922 len. 48]: -- As soon as I am on board at Dover for Paris , you and John must get yourselves married the first possible moment , and settle down here -- to make the best of the farm you can , and send me what you can spare .
Parsing [sent. 2923 len. 14]: I shall not want much , and John will have his own soon .
Parsing [sent. 2924 len. 10]: I know you will be good to Martha ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2925 len. 10]: `` John may take the farm if he will .
Parsing [sent. 2926 len. 11]: It would be immeasurably better than living with his mother .
Parsing [sent. 2927 len. 10]: For me , I am going with my uncle .
Parsing [sent. 2928 len. 23]: Why , uncle , I should be miserable in John 's very arms and you out of the country for our sakes !
Parsing [sent. 2929 len. 13]: Is there to be nobody in the world but husbands , forsooth !
Parsing [sent. 2930 len. 28]: I should love John ever so much more away with you and my duty , than if I had him with me , and you a wanderer .
Parsing [sent. 2931 len. 17]: How happy I shall be , thinking of John , and taking care of you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2932 len. 6]: He let me run on .
Parsing [sent. 2933 len. 30]: When I stopped at length -- `` In any case , '' he said with a smile , `` we can not do much till I am dressed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2934 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXVII .
Parsing [sent. 2935 len. 3]: AN ENCOUNTER .
Parsing [sent. 2936 len. 25]: I left my uncle 's room , and went to my own , to make what preparation I could for going abroad with him .
Parsing [sent. 2937 len. 27]: I got out my biggest box , and put in all my best things , and all the trifles I thought I could not do without .
Parsing [sent. 2938 len. 22]: Then , as there was room , I put in things I could do without , which yet would be useful .
Parsing [sent. 2939 len. 14]: Still there was room ; the content would shake about on the continent !
Parsing [sent. 2940 len. 21]: So I began to put in things I should like to have , but which were neither necessary nor useful .
Parsing [sent. 2941 len. 25]: Before I had got these in , the box was more than full , and some of them had to be taken out again .
Parsing [sent. 2942 len. 44]: In choosing which were to go and which to be left , I lost time ; but I did not know anything about the trains , and expected to be ready before my uncle , who would call me when he thought fit .
Parsing [sent. 2943 len. 7]: My thoughts also hindered my hands .
Parsing [sent. 2944 len. 22]: Very likely I should never marry John ; I would not heed that ; he would be mine all the same !
Parsing [sent. 2945 len. 36]: but to promise that I would not marry him , because it suited such a mother 's plans to marry him to some one else -- that I would not do to save my life !
Parsing [sent. 2946 len. 19]: I would have done it to save my uncle 's , but our exile would render it unnecessary !
Parsing [sent. 2947 len. 25]: At last I was ready , and went to find my uncle , reproaching myself that I had been so long away from him .
Parsing [sent. 2948 len. 23]: Besides , I ought to have been helping him to pack , for neither he nor his arm was quite strong yet .
Parsing [sent. 2949 len. 11]: With a heartful of apology , I sought his room .
Parsing [sent. 2950 len. 5]: He was not there .
Parsing [sent. 2951 len. 7]: Neither was he in the study .
Parsing [sent. 2952 len. 24]: I went all over the house , and then to the stable ; but he was nowhere , neither had anyone seen him .
Parsing [sent. 2953 len. 6]: And Death was gone too !
Parsing [sent. 2954 len. 19]: The truth burst upon me : I was to see him no more while that terrible woman lived !
Parsing [sent. 2955 len. 10]: No one was to know whither he had gone !
Parsing [sent. 2956 len. 8]: He had given himself for my happiness !
Parsing [sent. 2957 len. 3]: Vain intention !
Parsing [sent. 2958 len. 6]: I should never be happy !
Parsing [sent. 2959 len. 15]: To be in Paradise without him , would not be to be in Heaven !
Parsing [sent. 2960 len. 10]: John was in London ; I could do nothing !
Parsing [sent. 2961 len. 15]: I threw myself on my uncle 's bed , and lay lost in despair !
Parsing [sent. 2962 len. 17]: Even if John were with me , and we found him , what could we do ?
Parsing [sent. 2963 len. 35]: I knew it now as impossible for him to separate us that he might be unmolested , as it was for us to accept the sacrifice of his life that we might be happy .
Parsing [sent. 2964 len. 35]: I knew that John 's way would be to leave everything and go with me and my uncle , only we could not live upon nothing -- least of all in a strange land !
Parsing [sent. 2965 len. 32]: Martha , to be sure , could manage well enough with the bailiff , but John could not burden my uncle , and could not lay his hands on his own !
Parsing [sent. 2966 len. 13]: In the mean time my uncle was gone we knew not whither !
Parsing [sent. 2967 len. 10]: I was like one lost on the dark mountains .
Parsing [sent. 2968 len. 13]: -- If only John would come to take part in my despair !
Parsing [sent. 2969 len. 19]: With a sudden agony , I reproached myself that I had made no attempt to overtake my uncle .
Parsing [sent. 2970 len. 33]: It was true I did not know , for nobody could tell me , in what direction he had gone ; but Zoe 's instinct might have sufficed where mine was useless !
Parsing [sent. 2971 len. 8]: Zoe might have followed and found Thanatos !
Parsing [sent. 2972 len. 5]: It was hopeless now !
Parsing [sent. 2973 len. 8]: But I could no longer be still .
Parsing [sent. 2974 len. 10]: I got Zoe , and fled to the moor .
Parsing [sent. 2975 len. 22]: All the rest of the day I rode hither and thither , nor saw a single soul on its wide expanse .
Parsing [sent. 2976 len. 11]: The very life seemed to have gone out of it .
Parsing [sent. 2977 len. 18]: When most we take comfort in loneliness , it is because there is some one behind it .
Parsing [sent. 2978 len. 17]: The sun was set and the twilight deepening toward night when I turned to ride home .
Parsing [sent. 2979 len. 16]: I had eaten nothing since breakfast , and though not hungry , was thoroughly tired .
Parsing [sent. 2980 len. 33]: Through the great dark hush , where was no sound of water , though here and there , like lurking live thing , it lay about me , I rode slowly back .
Parsing [sent. 2981 len. 18]: My fasting and the dusk made everything in turn take a shape that was not its own .
Parsing [sent. 2982 len. 9]: I seemed to be haunted by things unknown .
Parsing [sent. 2983 len. 77]: I have sometimes thought whether the spirits that love solitary places , may not delight in appropriating , for embodiment momentary and partial , such a present shape as may happen to fit one of their passing moods ; whether it is always the _ mere _ gnarled , crone-like hawthorn , or misshapen rock , that , between the wanderer and the pale sky , suddenly appals him with the sense of _ another _ .
Parsing [sent. 2984 len. 20]: The hawthorn , the rock , the dead pine , is indeed there , but is it alone there ?
Parsing [sent. 2985 len. 41]: Some such thought was , I remember , in my mind , when , about halfway from home , I grew aware of something a little way in front that rose between me and a dark part of the sky .
Parsing [sent. 2986 len. 9]: It seemed a figure on a huge horse .
Parsing [sent. 2987 len. 34]: My first thought , very naturally , was of my uncle ; the next , of the great gray horse and his rider that John and I had both seen on the moor .
Parsing [sent. 2988 len. 36]: I confess to a little awe at the thought of the latter ; but I am somehow made so as to be capable of awe without terror , and of the latter I felt nothing .
Parsing [sent. 2989 len. 13]: The composite figure drew nearer : it was a woman on horseback .
Parsing [sent. 2990 len. 62]: Immediately I recalled the adventure of my childhood ; and then remembered that John had said his mother always rode the biggest horse she could find : could that shape , towering in the half-dark before me , be indeed my deadly enemy -- she who , my uncle had warned me , would kill me if she had the chance ?
Parsing [sent. 2991 len. 40]: A fear far other than ghostly invaded me , and for a moment I hesitated whether to ride on , or turn and make for some covert , until she should have passed from between me and my home .
Parsing [sent. 2992 len. 16]: I hope it was something better than pride that made me hold on my way .
Parsing [sent. 2993 len. 24]: If the wicked , I thought , flee when no man pursueth , it ill becomes the righteous to flee before the wicked .
Parsing [sent. 2994 len. 52]: By this time it was all but dark night , and I had a vague hope of passing unquestioned : there had been a good deal of rain , and we were in a very marshy part of the heath , so that I did not care to leave the track .
Parsing [sent. 2995 len. 24]: But , just ere we met , the lady turned her great animal right across the way , and there made him stand .
Parsing [sent. 2996 len. 21]: `` Ah , '' thought I , `` what could Zoe do in a race with that terrible horse ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2997 len. 19]: He seemed made of the darkness , and rose like the figurehead of a frigate above a yacht .
Parsing [sent. 2998 len. 13]: `` Show me the way to Rising , '' said his rider .
Parsing [sent. 2999 len. 6]: The hard bell-voice was unmistakable .
Parsing [sent. 3000 len. 13]: `` When you come where the track forks , '' I began .
Parsing [sent. 3001 len. 4]: She interrupted me .
Parsing [sent. 3002 len. 10]: `` How can I distinguish in the dark ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3003 len. 4]: she returned angrily .
Parsing [sent. 3004 len. 12]: `` Go on before , and show me the way . ''
Parsing [sent. 3005 len. 28]: Now I had good reason for thinking she knew the way perfectly well ; and still better reason for declining to go on in front of her .
Parsing [sent. 3006 len. 48]: `` You must excuse me , '' I said , `` for it is time I were at home ; but if you will turn and ride on in front of me , I will show you a better , though rather longer way to Rising . ''
Parsing [sent. 3007 len. 31]: `` Go on , or I will ride you down '' she cried , turning her horse 's head toward me , and making her whip hiss through the air .
Parsing [sent. 3008 len. 28]: The sound of it so startled Zoe , that she sprang aside , and was off the road a few yards before I could pull her up .
Parsing [sent. 3009 len. 11]: Then I saw the woman urging her horse to follow .
Parsing [sent. 3010 len. 24]: I knew the danger she was in , and , though tempted to be silent , called to her with a loud warning .
Parsing [sent. 3011 len. 11]: `` Mind what you are doing , lady Cairnedge ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3012 len. 3]: I cried .
Parsing [sent. 3013 len. 16]: `` The ground here will not carry the weight of a horse like yours . ''
Parsing [sent. 3014 len. 17]: But as I spoke he gave in , and sprang across the ditch at the way-side .
Parsing [sent. 3015 len. 7]: There , however , he stood .
Parsing [sent. 3016 len. 26]: `` You think to escape me , '' she answered , in a low , yet clear voice , with a cat-like growl in it .
Parsing [sent. 3017 len. 7]: `` You make a mistake ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3018 len. 18]: `` Your ladyship will make a worse mistake if you follow me here , '' I replied .
Parsing [sent. 3019 len. 23]: Her only rejoinder was a cut with her whip to her horse , which had stood motionless since taking his unwilling jump .
Parsing [sent. 3020 len. 12]: I spoke to Zoe ; she bounded off like a fawn .
Parsing [sent. 3021 len. 9]: I pulled her up , and looked back .
Parsing [sent. 3022 len. 7]: Lady Cairnedge continued urging her horse .
Parsing [sent. 3023 len. 9]: I heard and saw her whipping him furiously .
Parsing [sent. 3024 len. 6]: She had lost her temper .
Parsing [sent. 3025 len. 10]: I warned her once more , but she persisted .
Parsing [sent. 3026 len. 9]: `` Then you must take the consequences ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3027 len. 19]: I said ; and Zoe and I made for the road , but at a point nearer home .
Parsing [sent. 3028 len. 46]: Had she not been in a passion , she would have seen that her better way was to return to the road , and intercept us ; but her anger blinded her both to that and to the danger of the spot she was in .
Parsing [sent. 3029 len. 24]: We had not gone far when we heard behind us the soft plunging and sucking of the big hoofs through the boggy ground .
Parsing [sent. 3030 len. 6]: I looked over my shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 3031 len. 18]: There was the huge bulk , like Wordsworth 's peak , towering betwixt us and the stars !
Parsing [sent. 3032 len. 6]: `` Go , Zoe ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3033 len. 3]: I shrieked .
Parsing [sent. 3034 len. 4]: She bounded away .
Parsing [sent. 3035 len. 24]: The next moment , a cry came from the horse behind us , and I heard the woman say `` Good God ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3036 len. 9]: I stopped , and peered through the dark .
Parsing [sent. 3037 len. 15]: I saw something , but it was no higher above the ground than myself .
Parsing [sent. 3038 len. 4]: Terror seized me .
Parsing [sent. 3039 len. 6]: I turned and rode back .
Parsing [sent. 3040 len. 9]: `` My stupid animal has bogged himself ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3041 len. 5]: said lady Cairnedge quietly .
Parsing [sent. 3042 len. 25]: Deep in the dark watery peat , as thick as porridge , her horse gave a fruitless plunge or two , and sank lower .
Parsing [sent. 3043 len. 14]: `` For God 's sake , '' I cried , `` get off !
Parsing [sent. 3044 len. 8]: Your weight is sinking the poor animal !
Parsing [sent. 3045 len. 6]: You will smother him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3046 len. 23]: `` It will serve him right , '' she said venomously , and gave the helpless creature a cut across the ears .
Parsing [sent. 3047 len. 19]: `` You will go down with him , if you do not make haste , '' I insisted .
Parsing [sent. 3048 len. 15]: Another moment and she stood erect on the back of the slowly sinking horse .
Parsing [sent. 3049 len. 12]: `` Come and give me your hand , '' she cried .
Parsing [sent. 3050 len. 9]: `` You want to smother me with him !
Parsing [sent. 3051 len. 10]: I think I will not , '' I answered .
Parsing [sent. 3052 len. 10]: `` You can get on the solid well enough .
Parsing [sent. 3053 len. 14]: I will ride home and bring help for your horse , poor fellow !
Parsing [sent. 3054 len. 17]: Stay by him , talk to him , and keep him as quiet as you can .
Parsing [sent. 3055 len. 12]: If he go on struggling , nothing will save him . ''
Parsing [sent. 3056 len. 7]: She replied with a contemptuous laugh .
Parsing [sent. 3057 len. 22]: I got to the road as quickly as possible , and galloped home as fast as Zoe could touch and lift .
Parsing [sent. 3058 len. 17]: Ere I reached the stable-yard , I shouted so as to bring out all the men .
Parsing [sent. 3059 len. 38]: When I told them a lady had her horse fast in the bog , they bustled and coiled ropes , put collars and chains on four draught-horses , lighted several lanterns , and set out with me .
Parsing [sent. 3060 len. 6]: I knew the spot perfectly .
Parsing [sent. 3061 len. 15]: No moment was lost either in getting ready , or in reaching the place .
Parsing [sent. 3062 len. 11]: Neither the lady nor her horse was to be seen .
Parsing [sent. 3063 len. 7]: A great horror wrapt me round .
Parsing [sent. 3064 len. 5]: I felt a murderess .
Parsing [sent. 3065 len. 25]: She might have failed to spring to the bank of the hole for lack of the hand she had asked me to reach out !
Parsing [sent. 3066 len. 38]: Or her habit might have been entangled , so that she fell short , and went to the bottom -- to be found , one day , hardly changed , by the side of her peat-embalmed steed !
Parsing [sent. 3067 len. 18]: -- no ill fitting fate for her , but a ghastly thing to have a hand in !
Parsing [sent. 3068 len. 14]: She might , however , be on her way to Rising on foot !
Parsing [sent. 3069 len. 26]: I told two of the men to mount a pair of the horses , and go with me on the chance of rendering her assistance .
Parsing [sent. 3070 len. 29]: We took the way to Rising , and had gone about two miles , when we saw her , through the starlight , walking steadily along the track .
Parsing [sent. 3071 len. 35]: I rode up to her , and offered her one of the cart-horses : I would not have trusted my Zoe with her any more than with an American lion that lives upon horses .
Parsing [sent. 3072 len. 8]: She declined the proffer with quiet scorn .
Parsing [sent. 3073 len. 33]: I offered her one or both men to see her home , but the way in which she refused their service , made them glad they had not to go with her .
Parsing [sent. 3074 len. 17]: We had no choice , therefore turned and left her to get home as she might .
Parsing [sent. 3075 len. 30]: Not until we were on the way back , did it occur to me that I had not asked Martha whether she knew anything about my uncle 's departure .
Parsing [sent. 3076 len. 20]: She was never one to volunteer news , and , besides , would naturally think me in his confidence !
Parsing [sent. 3077 len. 29]: I found she knew nothing of our expedition , as no one had gone into the house -- had only heard the horses and voices , and wondered .
Parsing [sent. 3078 len. 39]: I was able to tell her what had happened ; but the moment I began to question her as to any knowledge of my uncle 's intentions , my strength gave way , and I burst into tears .
Parsing [sent. 3079 len. 9]: `` Do n't be silly , Belorba ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3080 len. 6]: cried Martha , almost severely .
Parsing [sent. 3081 len. 27]: `` You an engaged young lady , and tied so to your uncle 's apron-strings that you cry the minute he 's out of your sight !
Parsing [sent. 3082 len. 11]: You did n't cry when Mr. Day left you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3083 len. 19]: `` No , '' I answered ; `` he was going only for a day or two ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3084 len. 11]: `` And for how many is your uncle gone ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3085 len. 9]: `` That is what I want to know .
Parsing [sent. 3086 len. 13]: He means to be away a long time , I fear . ''
Parsing [sent. 3087 len. 12]: `` Then it 's nothing but your fancy sets you crying !
Parsing [sent. 3088 len. 8]: -- But I 'll just see ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3089 len. 3]: she returned .
Parsing [sent. 3090 len. 13]: `` I shall know by the money he left for the house-keeping !
Parsing [sent. 3091 len. 12]: Only I wo n't budge till I see you eat . ''
Parsing [sent. 3092 len. 11]: Faint for want of food , I had no appetite .
Parsing [sent. 3093 len. 24]: But I began at once to eat , and she left me to fetch the money he had given her as he went .
Parsing [sent. 3094 len. 15]: She came back with a pocket-book , opened it , and looked into it .
Parsing [sent. 3095 len. 6]: Then she looked at me .
Parsing [sent. 3096 len. 7]: Her expression was of unmistakable dismay .
Parsing [sent. 3097 len. 14]: I took the pocket-book from her hand : it was full of notes !
Parsing [sent. 3098 len. 26]: I learned afterward , that it was his habit to have money in the house , in readiness for some possible sudden need of it .
Parsing [sent. 3099 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXVIII .
Parsing [sent. 3100 len. 3]: ANOTHER VISION .
Parsing [sent. 3101 len. 32]: That same night , within an hour , to my unspeakable relief , John came home -- at least he came to me , who he always said was his home .
Parsing [sent. 3102 len. 40]: It was rather late , but we went out to the wilderness , where I had a good cry on his shoulder ; after which I felt better , and hope began to show signs of life in me .
Parsing [sent. 3103 len. 23]: I never asked him how he had got on in London , but told him all that had happened since he went .
Parsing [sent. 3104 len. 42]: It was worse than painful to tell him about his mother 's letter , and what my uncle told me in consequence of it , also my personal adventure with her so lately ; but I felt I must hide nothing .
Parsing [sent. 3105 len. 17]: If a man 's mother is a devil , it is well he should know it .
Parsing [sent. 3106 len. 15]: He sat like a sleeping hurricane while I spoke , saying never a word .
Parsing [sent. 3107 len. 12]: When I had ended , -- `` Is that all ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3108 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 3109 len. 13]: `` It is all , John : is it not enough ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3110 len. 3]: I answered .
Parsing [sent. 3111 len. 22]: `` It is enough , '' he cried , with an oath that frightened me , and started to his feet .
Parsing [sent. 3112 len. 5]: The hurricane was awake .
Parsing [sent. 3113 len. 7]: I threw my arms round him .
Parsing [sent. 3114 len. 7]: `` Where are you going ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3115 len. 3]: I said .
Parsing [sent. 3116 len. 9]: `` To _ her _ '' he answered .
Parsing [sent. 3117 len. 5]: `` What for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3118 len. 25]: `` To _ kill _ her , '' he said -- then threw himself on the ground , and lay motionless at my feet .
Parsing [sent. 3119 len. 4]: I kept silence .
Parsing [sent. 3120 len. 15]: I thought with myself he was fighting the nature his mother had given him .
Parsing [sent. 3121 len. 12]: He lay still for about two minutes , then quietly rose .
Parsing [sent. 3122 len. 7]: `` Good night , dearest ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3123 len. 9]: he said ; '' -- no ; good-bye !
Parsing [sent. 3124 len. 17]: It is not fit the son of such a mother should marry any honest woman . ''
Parsing [sent. 3125 len. 9]: `` I beg your pardon , John ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3126 len. 17]: I returned ; `` I hope _ I _ may have a word in the matter !
Parsing [sent. 3127 len. 15]: If I choose to marry you , what right have you to draw back ?
Parsing [sent. 3128 len. 24]: Let us leave alone the thing that has to be , and remember that my uncle must not be denounced as a murderer !
Parsing [sent. 3129 len. 5]: Something must be done .
Parsing [sent. 3130 len. 24]: That he is beyond personal danger for the present is something ; but is he to be the talk of the country ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3131 len. 12]: `` No harm shall come to him , '' said John .
Parsing [sent. 3132 len. 14]: `` If I do n't throttle the tigress , I 'll muzzle her .
Parsing [sent. 3133 len. 8]: I know how to deal with her .
Parsing [sent. 3134 len. 16]: She has learned at least , that what her stupid son says , he does !
Parsing [sent. 3135 len. 63]: I shall make her understand that , on her slightest movement to disgrace your uncle , I will marry you right off , come what may ; and if she goes on , I shall get myself summoned for the defence , that , if I can say nothing for _ him _ , I may say something against _ her _ .
Parsing [sent. 3136 len. 29]: Besides , I will tell her that , when my time comes , if I find anything amiss with her accounts , I will give her no quarter .
Parsing [sent. 3137 len. 37]: -- But , Orbie , '' he continued , `` as I will not threaten what I may not be able to perform , you must promise not to prevent me from carrying it out . ''
Parsing [sent. 3138 len. 26]: `` I promise , '' I said , `` that , if it be necessary for your truth , I will marry you at once .
Parsing [sent. 3139 len. 12]: I only hope she may not already have taken steps ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3140 len. 9]: `` Her two days are not yet expired .
Parsing [sent. 3141 len. 8]: I shall present myself in good time .
Parsing [sent. 3142 len. 21]: -- But I wonder you are not afraid to trust yourself alone with the son of such a mother ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3143 len. 34]: `` To be what I know you , John , '' I answered , `` and the son of that woman , shows a good angel was not far off at your birth .
Parsing [sent. 3144 len. 6]: But why talk of angels ?
Parsing [sent. 3145 len. 11]: Whoever was your mother , God is your father ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3146 len. 12]: He made no reply beyond a loving pressure of my hand .
Parsing [sent. 3147 len. 15]: Then he asked me whether I could lend him something to ride home upon .
Parsing [sent. 3148 len. 34]: I told him there was an old horse the bailiff rode sometimes ; I was very sorry he could not have Zoe : she had been out all day and was too tired !
Parsing [sent. 3149 len. 26]: He said Zoe was much too precious for a hulking fellow like him to ride , but he would be glad of the old horse .
Parsing [sent. 3150 len. 13]: I went to the stable with him , and saw him mount .
Parsing [sent. 3151 len. 10]: What a determined look there was on his face !
Parsing [sent. 3152 len. 7]: He seemed quite a middle-aged man .
Parsing [sent. 3153 len. 15]: I have now to tell how he fared on the moor as he rode .
Parsing [sent. 3154 len. 15]: It had turned gusty and rather cold , and was still a dark night .
Parsing [sent. 3155 len. 34]: The moon would be up by and by however , and giving light enough , he thought , before he came to the spot where his way parted company with that to Dumbleton .
Parsing [sent. 3156 len. 41]: The moon , however , did not see fit to rise so soon as John expected her : he was not at that time quite _ up _ in moons , any more than in the paths across that moor .
Parsing [sent. 3157 len. 92]: Now as he had not an idea where his rider wanted to be carried , and as John did for a while -- he confessed it -- fall into a reverie or something worse , old Sturdy had to choose for himself where to go , and took a path he had often had to take some years before ; nor did John discover that he was out of the way , until he felt him going steep clown , and thought of Sleipner bearing Hermod to the realm of Hela .
Parsing [sent. 3158 len. 23]: But he let him keep on , wishing to know , as he said , what the old fellow was up to .
Parsing [sent. 3159 len. 9]: Presently , he came to a dead halt .
Parsing [sent. 3160 len. 23]: John had not the least notion where they were , but I knew the spot the moment he began to describe it .
Parsing [sent. 3161 len. 36]: By the removal of the peat on the side of a slope , the skeleton of the hill had been a little exposed , and had for a good many years been blasted for building-stones .
Parsing [sent. 3162 len. 10]: Nothing was going on in the quarry at present .
Parsing [sent. 3163 len. 27]: Above , it was rather a dangerous place ; there was a legend of man and horse having fallen into it , and both being killed .
Parsing [sent. 3164 len. 9]: John had never seen or heard of it .
Parsing [sent. 3165 len. 28]: When his horse stopped , he became aware of an indefinite sensation which inclined him to await the expected moon before attempting either to advance or return .
Parsing [sent. 3166 len. 45]: He thought afterward it might have been some feeling of the stone about him , but at the time he took the place for an abrupt natural dip of the surface of the moor , in the bottom of which might be a pool .
Parsing [sent. 3167 len. 25]: Sturdy stood as still as if he had been part of the quarry , stood as if never of himself would he move again .
Parsing [sent. 3168 len. 13]: The light slowly grew , or rather , the darkness slowly thinned .
Parsing [sent. 3169 len. 19]: All at once John became aware that , some yards away from him , there was something whitish .
Parsing [sent. 3170 len. 16]: A moment , and it began to move like a flitting mist through the darkness .
Parsing [sent. 3171 len. 67]: The same instant Sturdy began to pull his feet from the ground , and move after the mist , which rose and rose until it came for a second or two between John and the sky : it was a big white horse , with my uncle on his back : Death and he , John concluded , were out on one of their dark wanderings !
Parsing [sent. 3172 len. 11]: His impulse , of course , was to follow them .
Parsing [sent. 3173 len. 32]: But , as they went up the steep way , Sturdy came down on his old knees , and John got off his back to let him recover himself the easier .
Parsing [sent. 3174 len. 82]: When they reached the level , where the moon , showing a blunt horn above the horizon , made it possible to see a little , the white horse and his rider had disappeared -- in some shadow , or behind some knoll , I fancy ; and John , having not the least notion in what part of the moor he was , or in which direction he ought to go , threw the reins on the horse 's neck .
Parsing [sent. 3175 len. 16]: Sturdy brought him back almost to his stable , before he knew where he was .
Parsing [sent. 3176 len. 23]: Then he turned into the road , for he had had enough of the moor , and took the long way home .
Parsing [sent. 3177 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXIX .
Parsing [sent. 3178 len. 4]: MOTHER AND SON .
Parsing [sent. 3179 len. 7]: In the morning he breakfasted alone .
Parsing [sent. 3180 len. 53]: A son with a different sort of mother , might then have sought her in her bedroom ; but John had never within his memory seen his mother in her bedroom , and after what lie had heard the night before , could hardly be inclined to go there to her now .
Parsing [sent. 3181 len. 22]: Within half an hour , however , a message was brought him , requesting his presence in her ladyship 's dressing-room .
Parsing [sent. 3182 len. 7]: He went with his teeth set .
Parsing [sent. 3183 len. 12]: `` Whose horse is that in the stable , John ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3184 len. 9]: she said , the moment their eyes met .
Parsing [sent. 3185 len. 19]: `` Mr. Whichcote 's , madam , '' answered John : _ mother _ he could not say .
Parsing [sent. 3186 len. 14]: `` You intend to keep up your late relations with those persons ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3187 len. 5]: `` I do . ''
Parsing [sent. 3188 len. 9]: `` You mean to marry the hussy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3189 len. 14]: `` I mean to marry the lady to whom you give that epithet .
Parsing [sent. 3190 len. 18]: There are those who think it not quite safe for you to call other people names ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3191 len. 13]: She rose and came at him as if she would strike him .
Parsing [sent. 3192 len. 4]: John stood motionless .
Parsing [sent. 3193 len. 23]: Except a woman had a knife in her hand , he said , he would not even avoid a blow from her .
Parsing [sent. 3194 len. 17]: `` A woman ca n't hurt you much ; she can only break your heart ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3195 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 3196 len. 15]: `` My mother would not know a heart when she had broken it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3197 len. 3]: he added .
Parsing [sent. 3198 len. 7]: He stood and looked at her .
Parsing [sent. 3199 len. 9]: She turned away , and sat down again .
Parsing [sent. 3200 len. 12]: I think she felt the term of her power at hand .
Parsing [sent. 3201 len. 24]: `` The man told you then , that , if you did not return immediately , I would get him into trouble ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3202 len. 7]: `` He has told me nothing .
Parsing [sent. 3203 len. 9]: I have not seen him for some days .
Parsing [sent. 3204 len. 7]: I have been to London . ''
Parsing [sent. 3205 len. 14]: `` You should have contrived your story better : you contradict yourself . ''
Parsing [sent. 3206 len. 10]: `` I am not aware that I do . ''
Parsing [sent. 3207 len. 9]: `` You have the man 's horse ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3208 len. 16]: `` His horse is in my stable ; he is not himself at home . ''
Parsing [sent. 3209 len. 5]: `` Fled from justice !
Parsing [sent. 3210 len. 7]: It shall not avail him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3211 len. 9]: `` It may avail you though , madam !
Parsing [sent. 3212 len. 9]: It is sometimes prudent to let well alone .
Parsing [sent. 3213 len. 19]: May I not suggest that a hostile attempt on your part , might lead to awkward revelations ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3214 len. 29]: `` Ah , where could the seed of slander find fitter soil than the heart of a son with whom the prayer of his mother is powerless ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3215 len. 20]: To all appearance she had thoroughly regained her composure , and looked at him with a quite artistic reproach .
Parsing [sent. 3216 len. 14]: `` The prayer of a mother that never prayed in her life ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3217 len. 17]: returned John ; '' -- of a woman that never had an anxiety but for herself !
Parsing [sent. 3218 len. 10]: -- I do n't believe you are my mother .
Parsing [sent. 3219 len. 20]: If I was born of you , there must have been some juggling with my soul in antenatal regions !
Parsing [sent. 3220 len. 5]: I disown you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3221 len. 12]: cried John with indignation that grew as he gave it issue .
Parsing [sent. 3222 len. 24]: Her face turned ashy white ; but whether it was from conscience or fear , or only with rage , who could tell !
Parsing [sent. 3223 len. 7]: She was silent for a moment .
Parsing [sent. 3224 len. 19]: Then again recovering herself , -- `` And what , pray , would you make of me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3225 len. 4]: she said coolly .
Parsing [sent. 3226 len. 5]: `` Your slave ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3227 len. 9]: `` I would have you an honest woman !
Parsing [sent. 3228 len. 6]: I would die for that !
Parsing [sent. 3229 len. 5]: -- Oh , mother !
Parsing [sent. 3230 len. 3]: mother ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3231 len. 4]: he cried bitterly .
Parsing [sent. 3232 len. 18]: `` That being apparently impossible , what else does my dutiful son demand of his mother ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3233 len. 14]: `` That she should leave me unmolested in my choice of a wife .
Parsing [sent. 3234 len. 11]: It does not seem to me an unreasonable demand ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3235 len. 39]: `` Nor does it seem to me an unreasonable reply , that any mother would object to her son 's marrying a girl whose father she could throw into a felon 's - prison with a word ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3236 len. 30]: `` That the girl does not happen to be the daughter of the gentleman you mean , signifies nothing : I am very willing she should pass for such .
Parsing [sent. 3237 len. 4]: But take care .
Parsing [sent. 3238 len. 11]: He is ready to meet whatever you have to say .
Parsing [sent. 3239 len. 31]: He is not gone for his own sake , but to be out of the way of our happiness -- to prevent you from blasting us with a public scandal .
Parsing [sent. 3240 len. 20]: If you proceed in your purpose , we shall marry at once , and make your scheme futile . ''
Parsing [sent. 3241 len. 10]: `` How are you to live , pray ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3242 len. 12]: `` Madam , that is my business , '' answered John .
Parsing [sent. 3243 len. 15]: `` Are you aware of the penalty on your marrying without my consent ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3244 len. 4]: pursued his mother .
Parsing [sent. 3245 len. 5]: `` I am not .
Parsing [sent. 3246 len. 11]: I do not believe there is any such penalty . ''
Parsing [sent. 3247 len. 6]: `` You dare me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3248 len. 5]: `` I do . ''
Parsing [sent. 3249 len. 11]: `` Marry , then , and take the consequences . ''
Parsing [sent. 3250 len. 16]: `` If there were any , you would not thus warn me of them . ''
Parsing [sent. 3251 len. 10]: `` John Day , you are no gentleman ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3252 len. 14]: `` I shall not ask your definition of a gentleman , madam . ''
Parsing [sent. 3253 len. 8]: `` Your father was a clown ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3254 len. 19]: `` If my father were present , he would show himself a gentleman by making you no answer .
Parsing [sent. 3255 len. 16]: If you say a word more against him , I will leave the room . ''
Parsing [sent. 3256 len. 17]: `` I tell you your father was a clown and a fool -- like yourself ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3257 len. 18]: John turned and went to the stable , had old Sturdy saddled , and came to me .
Parsing [sent. 3258 len. 28]: On his way over the heath , he spent an hour trying to find the place where he had been the night before , but without success .
Parsing [sent. 3259 len. 25]: I presume that Sturdy , with his nose in that direction , preferred his stall , and did not choose to find the quarry .
Parsing [sent. 3260 len. 13]: As often as John left him to himself , he went homeward .
Parsing [sent. 3261 len. 25]: When John turned his head in another direction , he would set out in that direction , but gradually work round for the farm .
Parsing [sent. 3262 len. 15]: John told me all I have just set down , and then we talked .
Parsing [sent. 3263 len. 13]: `` I have already begun to learn farming , '' I said .
Parsing [sent. 3264 len. 10]: `` You are the right sort , Orbie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3265 len. 3]: returned John .
Parsing [sent. 3266 len. 13]: `` I shall be glad to teach you anything I know . ''
Parsing [sent. 3267 len. 34]: `` If you will show me how a farmer keeps his books , '' I answered , `` that I may understand the bailiff 's , I shall be greatly obliged to you .
Parsing [sent. 3268 len. 24]: As to the dairy , and poultry-yard , and that kind of thing , Martha can teach me as well as any . ''
Parsing [sent. 3269 len. 11]: `` I 'll do my best , '' said John .
Parsing [sent. 3270 len. 12]: `` Come along then , and have a talk with Simmons !
Parsing [sent. 3271 len. 15]: I feel as if I could bear anything after what you saw last night .
Parsing [sent. 3272 len. 7]: My uncle is not far off !
Parsing [sent. 3273 len. 12]: He is somewhere about with the rest of the angels ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3274 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXX .
Parsing [sent. 3275 len. 7]: ONCE MORE , AND YET AGAIN .
Parsing [sent. 3276 len. 14]: From that hour I set myself to look after my uncle 's affairs .
Parsing [sent. 3277 len. 10]: It was the only way to endure his absence .
Parsing [sent. 3278 len. 42]: Working for him , thinking what he would like , trying to carry it out , referring every perplexity to him and imagining his answer , he grew so much dearer to me , that his absence was filled with hope .
Parsing [sent. 3279 len. 60]: My heart being in it , I had soon learned enough of the management to perceive where , in more than one quarter , improvement , generally in the way of saving , was possible : I do not mean by any lowering of wages ; my uncle would have conned me small thanks for such improvement as that !
Parsing [sent. 3280 len. 76]: Neither was it long before I began to delight in the feeling that I was in partnership with the powers of life ; that I had to do with the operation and government and preservation of things created ; that I was doing a work to which I was set by the Highest ; that I was at least a floor-sweeper in the house of God , a servant for the good of his world .
Parsing [sent. 3281 len. 38]: Existence had grown fuller and richer ; I had come , like a toad out of a rock , into a larger , therefore truer universe , in which I had work to do that was wanted .
Parsing [sent. 3282 len. 22]: Had I not been thus expanded and strengthened , how should I have patiently waited while hearing nothing of my uncle !
Parsing [sent. 3283 len. 35]: It was not many days before John began to press me to let my uncle have his way : where was the good any longer , he said , in our not being married ?
Parsing [sent. 3284 len. 28]: But I could not endure the thought of being married without my uncle : it would not seem real marriage without his giving me to my husband .
Parsing [sent. 3285 len. 32]: And when John was convinced that I could not be prevailed upon , I found him think the more of me because of my resolve , and my persistency in it .
Parsing [sent. 3286 len. 18]: For John was always reasonable , and that is more than can be said of most men .
Parsing [sent. 3287 len. 17]: Some , indeed , who are reasonable enough with men , are often unreasonable with women .
Parsing [sent. 3288 len. 39]: If in course of time the management of affairs be taken from men and given to women -- which may God for our sakes forbid -- it will be because men have made it necessary by their arrogance .
Parsing [sent. 3289 len. 54]: But when they have been kept down long enough to learn that they are not the lords of creation one bit more than the weakest woman , I hope they will be allowed to take the lead again , lest women should become what men were , and go strutting in their importance .
Parsing [sent. 3290 len. 39]: Only the true man knows the true woman ; only the true woman knows the true man : the difficulty between men and women comes all from the prevailing selfishness , that is , untruth , of both .
Parsing [sent. 3291 len. 23]: Who , while such is their character , would be judge or divider between them , save one of their own kind ?
Parsing [sent. 3292 len. 15]: When such ceases to be their character , they will call for no umpire .
Parsing [sent. 3293 len. 16]: John lived in his own house with his mother , but they did not meet .
Parsing [sent. 3294 len. 31]: His mother managed his affairs , to whose advantage I need hardly say ; and John helped me to manage my uncle 's , to the advantage of all concerned .
Parsing [sent. 3295 len. 20]: Every morning he came to see me , and every night rode back to his worse than dreary home .
Parsing [sent. 3296 len. 26]: At my earnest request , he had a strong bolt put on his bedroom-door , the use of which he promised me never to neglect .
Parsing [sent. 3297 len. 33]: At my suggestion too , he let it be known that he had always a brace of loaded pistols within his reach , and showed himself well practiced in shooting with them .
Parsing [sent. 3298 len. 6]: I feared much for John .
Parsing [sent. 3299 len. 47]: After I no longer only believed , but knew the bailiff trustworthy , and had got some few points in his management bettered , I ceased giving so much attention to details , and allowed myself more time to read and walk and ride with John .
Parsing [sent. 3300 len. 25]: I laid myself out to make up to him , as much as ever I could , for the miserable lack of any home-life .
Parsing [sent. 3301 len. 14]: At Rising he had not the least sense of comfort or even security .
Parsing [sent. 3302 len. 14]: He could never tell what his mother might not be plotting against him .
Parsing [sent. 3303 len. 32]: He had a very strong close box made for Leander , and always locked him up in it at night , never allowing one of the men there to touch him .
Parsing [sent. 3304 len. 30]: The horse had all the attention any master could desire , when , having locked his box behind him , he brought him over to us in the morning .
Parsing [sent. 3305 len. 79]: One lovely , cold day , in the month of March , with ice on some of the pools , and the wind blowing from the north , I mounted Zoe to meet John midway on the moor , and had gone about two-thirds of the distance , when I saw him , as I thought , a long way to my right , and concluded he had not expected me so soon , and had gone exploring .
Parsing [sent. 3306 len. 58]: I turned aside therefore to join him ; but had gone only a few yards when , from some shift in a shadow , or some change in his position with regard to the light , I saw that the horse was not John 's ; it was a gray , or rather , a white horse .
Parsing [sent. 3307 len. 7]: Could the rider be my uncle ?
Parsing [sent. 3308 len. 11]: Even at that distance I almost thought I recognized him .
Parsing [sent. 3309 len. 12]: It must indeed have been he John saw at the quarry !
Parsing [sent. 3310 len. 6]: He was not gone abroad !
Parsing [sent. 3311 len. 18]: He had been all this long time lingering about the place , lest ill should befall us !
Parsing [sent. 3312 len. 6]: `` Just like him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3313 len. 20]: said my heart , as I gave Zoe the rein , and she sprang off at her best speed .
Parsing [sent. 3314 len. 39]: But after riding some distance , I lost sight of the horseman , whoever he was , and then saw that , if I did not turn at once , I should not keep my appointment with John .
Parsing [sent. 3315 len. 59]: Of course had I _ believed _ it was my uncle , I should have followed and followed ; and the incident would not have been worth mentioning , for gray horses are not so uncommon that there might not be one upon the heath at any moment , but for something more I saw the same night .
Parsing [sent. 3316 len. 5]: It was bright moonlight .
Parsing [sent. 3317 len. 24]: I had taken down a curtain of my window to mend , and the moon shone in so that I could not sleep .
Parsing [sent. 3318 len. 48]: My thoughts were all with my uncle -- wondering what he was about ; whether he was very dull ; whether he wanted me much ; whether he was going about Paris , or haunting the moor that stretched far into the distance from where I lay .
Parsing [sent. 3319 len. 28]: Perhaps at that moment he was out there in the moonlight , would be there alone , in the cold , wide night , while I slept !
Parsing [sent. 3320 len. 53]: The thought made me feel lonely myself : one is indeed apt to feel lonely when sleepless ; and as the moon was having a night of it , or rather making a day of it , all alone with herself , why should we not keep each other a little company ?
Parsing [sent. 3321 len. 16]: I rose , drew the other curtain of my window aside , and looked out .
Parsing [sent. 3322 len. 42]: I have said that the house lay on the slope of a hollow : from whichever window of it you glanced , you saw the line of your private horizon either close to you , or but a little way off .
Parsing [sent. 3323 len. 18]: If you wanted an outlook , you must climb ; and then you were on the moor .
Parsing [sent. 3324 len. 30]: From my window I could see the more distant edge of the hollow : looking thitherward , I saw against the sky the shape of a man on horseback .
Parsing [sent. 3325 len. 12]: Not for a moment could I doubt it was my uncle .
Parsing [sent. 3326 len. 6]: The figure was plainly his .
Parsing [sent. 3327 len. 17]: My heart seemed to stand still with awe , or was it with intensity of gladness ?
Parsing [sent. 3328 len. 37]: Perhaps every night he was thus near me while I slept -- a heavenly sentinel patrolling the house -- the visible one of a whole camp unseen , of horses of fire and chariots of fire .
Parsing [sent. 3329 len. 29]: So entrancing was the notion , that I stood there a little child , a mere incarnate love , the tears running down my checks for very bliss .
Parsing [sent. 3330 len. 11]: But presently my mood changed : what had befallen him ?
Parsing [sent. 3331 len. 28]: When first I saw him , horse and man were standing still , and I noted nothing strange , blinded perhaps by the tears of my gladness .
Parsing [sent. 3332 len. 45]: But presently they moved on , keeping so to the horizon-line that it was plain my uncle 's object was to have the house full in view ; and as thus they skirted the edge of heaven , oh , how changed he seemed !
Parsing [sent. 3333 len. 14]: His tall figure hung bent over the pommel , his neck drooped heavily .
Parsing [sent. 3334 len. 18]: And the horse was so thin that I seemed to see , almost to feel his bones .
Parsing [sent. 3335 len. 3]: Poor Thanatos !
Parsing [sent. 3336 len. 21]: he looked tired to death , and I fancied his bent knees quivering , each short slow step he took .
Parsing [sent. 3337 len. 12]: Ah , how unlike the happy old horse that had been !
Parsing [sent. 3338 len. 20]: I thought of Death returning home weary from the slaughter of many kings , and cast the thought away .
Parsing [sent. 3339 len. 40]: I thought of Death returning home on the eve of the great dawn , worn with his age-long work , pleased that at last it was over , and no more need of him : I kept that thought .
Parsing [sent. 3340 len. 43]: Along the sky-line they held their slow way , toilsome through weakness , the rider with weary swing in the saddle , the horse with long gray neck hanging low to his hoofs , as if picking his path with purblind eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3341 len. 28]: When his rider should collapse and fall from his back , not a step further would he take , but stand there till he fell to pieces !
Parsing [sent. 3342 len. 6]: Fancy gave way to reality .
Parsing [sent. 3343 len. 18]: I woke up , called myself hard names , and hurried on a few of my clothes .
Parsing [sent. 3344 len. 24]: My blessed uncle out in the night and weary to dissolution , and I at a window , contemplating him like a picture !
Parsing [sent. 3345 len. 8]: I was an evil , heartless brute !
Parsing [sent. 3346 len. 24]: By the time I had my shoes on , and went again to the window , he had passed out of its range .
Parsing [sent. 3347 len. 24]: I ran to one on the stair that looked at right angles to mine : he had not yet come within its field .
Parsing [sent. 3348 len. 5]: I stood and waited .
Parsing [sent. 3349 len. 47]: Presently he appeared , crawling along , a gray mounted ghost , in the light that so strangely befits lovers wandering in the May of hope , and the wasted spectre no less , whose imagination of the past reveals him to the eyes of men .
Parsing [sent. 3350 len. 49]: For an instant I almost wished him dead and at rest ; the next I was out of the house -- then up on the moor , looking eagerly this way and that , poised on the swift feet of love , ready to spring to his bosom .
Parsing [sent. 3351 len. 33]: How I longed to lead him to his own warm bed , and watch by him as he slept , while the great father kept watch over every heart in his universe .
Parsing [sent. 3352 len. 14]: I gazed and gazed , but nowhere could I see the death-jaded horseman .
Parsing [sent. 3353 len. 20]: I bounded down the hill , through the wilderness and the dark alleys , and hurried to the stable .
Parsing [sent. 3354 len. 22]: Trembling with haste I led Zoe out , sprang on her bare back , and darted off to scout the moor .
Parsing [sent. 3355 len. 18]: Not a man or a horse or a live thing was to be seen in any direction !
Parsing [sent. 3356 len. 13]: Once more I all but concluded I had looked on an apparition .
Parsing [sent. 3357 len. 5]: Was my uncle dead ?
Parsing [sent. 3358 len. 10]: Had he come back thus to let me know ?
Parsing [sent. 3359 len. 8]: And was he now gone home indeed ?
Parsing [sent. 3360 len. 36]: Cold and disappointed , I returned to bed , full of the conviction that I had seen my uncle , but whether in the body or out of the body , I could not tell .
Parsing [sent. 3361 len. 27]: When John came , the notion of my having been out alone on the moor in the middle of the night , did not please him .
Parsing [sent. 3362 len. 23]: He would have me promise not again , for any vision or apparition whatever , to leave the house without his company .
Parsing [sent. 3363 len. 7]: But he could not persuade me .
Parsing [sent. 3364 len. 24]: He asked what I would have done , if , having overtaken the horseman , I had found neither my uncle nor Death .
Parsing [sent. 3365 len. 28]: I told him I would have given Zoe the use of her heels , when _ that _ horse would soon have seen the last of her .
Parsing [sent. 3366 len. 20]: At the same time , he was inclined to believe with me , that I had seen my uncle .
Parsing [sent. 3367 len. 41]: His intended proximity would account , he said , for his making no arrangement to hear from me ; and if he continued to haunt the moor in such fashion , we could not fail to encounter him before long .
Parsing [sent. 3368 len. 16]: In the meantime he thought it well to show no sign of suspecting his neighbourhood .
Parsing [sent. 3369 len. 37]: That I had seen my uncle , John was for a moment convinced when , the very next day , having gone to Wittenage , he saw Thanatos carrying Dr. Southwell , my uncle 's friend .
Parsing [sent. 3370 len. 16]: On the other hand , Thanatos looked very much alive , and in lovely condition !
Parsing [sent. 3371 len. 39]: The doctor would not confess to knowing anything about my uncle , and expressed wonder that he had not yet returned , but said he did not mind how long he had the loan of such a horse .
Parsing [sent. 3372 len. 9]: Things went on as before for a while .
Parsing [sent. 3373 len. 10]: John began again to press me to marry him .
Parsing [sent. 3374 len. 42]: I think it was mainly , I am sure it was in part , that I might never again ride the midnight moor -- `` like a witch out on her own mischievous hook , '' as he had once said .
Parsing [sent. 3375 len. 26]: He knew that , if I caught sight of anything like my uncle anywhere , John or no John , I would go after it .
Parsing [sent. 3376 len. 42]: There was another good reason , however , besides the absence of my uncle , for our not marrying : John was not yet of legal age , and who could tell what might not lurk in his mother 's threat !
Parsing [sent. 3377 len. 21]: Who could tell what such a woman might not have prevailed on her husband to set down in his will !
Parsing [sent. 3378 len. 31]: I was ready enough to marry a poor man , but I was not ready to let my lover become a poor man by marrying me a few months sooner .
Parsing [sent. 3379 len. 17]: Were we not happy enough , seeing each other everyday , and mostly all day long ?
Parsing [sent. 3380 len. 12]: No doubt people talked , but why not let them talk ?
Parsing [sent. 3381 len. 12]: The mind of the many is not the mind of God !
Parsing [sent. 3382 len. 13]: As to society , John called it an oyster of a divinity .
Parsing [sent. 3383 len. 18]: He argued , however , that probably my uncle was keeping close until he saw us married .
Parsing [sent. 3384 len. 37]: I answered that , if we were married , his mother would only be the more eager to have her revenge on us all , and my uncle the more careful of himself for our sakes .
Parsing [sent. 3385 len. 21]: Anyhow , I said , I would not consent to be happier than we were , until we found him .
Parsing [sent. 3386 len. 11]: The greater happiness I would receive only from his hand .
Parsing [sent. 3387 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXXI .
Parsing [sent. 3388 len. 5]: MY UNCLE COMES HOME .
Parsing [sent. 3389 len. 17]: Time went on , and it was now the depth of a cold , miserable winter .
Parsing [sent. 3390 len. 13]: I remember the day to which I have now come so well !
Parsing [sent. 3391 len. 6]: It was a black day .
Parsing [sent. 3392 len. 21]: There was such a thickness of snow in the air , that what light got through had a lost look .
Parsing [sent. 3393 len. 22]: It was almost more like a London fog than an honest darkness of the atmosphere , bred in its own bounds .
Parsing [sent. 3394 len. 12]: But while the light lasted , the snow did not fall .
Parsing [sent. 3395 len. 20]: I went about the house doing what I could find to do , and wondering John did not come .
Parsing [sent. 3396 len. 36]: His horse had again fallen lame -- this time through an accident which made it necessary for him to stay with the poor animal long after his usual time of starting to come to me .
Parsing [sent. 3397 len. 18]: When he did start , it was on foot , with the short winter afternoon closing in .
Parsing [sent. 3398 len. 15]: But he knew the moor by this time nearly as well as I did .
Parsing [sent. 3399 len. 22]: It was quite dark when he drew near the house , which he generally entered through the wilderness and the garden .
Parsing [sent. 3400 len. 15]: The snow had begun at last , and was coming down in deliberate earnest .
Parsing [sent. 3401 len. 12]: It would lie feet deep over the moor before the morning !
Parsing [sent. 3402 len. 62]: He was thinking what a dreary tramp home it would be by the road -- for the wind was threatening to wake , and in a snow-wind the moor was a place to be avoided -- when he struck his foot against something soft , in the path his own feet had worn to the wilderness , and fell over it .
Parsing [sent. 3403 len. 17]: A groan followed , and John rose with the miserable feeling of having hurt some creature .
Parsing [sent. 3404 len. 23]: Dropping on his knees to discover what it was , he found a man almost covered with snow , and nearly insensible .
Parsing [sent. 3405 len. 35]: He swept the snow off him , contrived to get him on his back , and brought him round to the door , for the fence would have been awkward to cross with him .
Parsing [sent. 3406 len. 26]: Just as I began to be really uneasy at his prolonged absence , there he was , with a man on his back apparently lifeless !
Parsing [sent. 3407 len. 16]: I did not stop to stare or question , but made haste to help him .
Parsing [sent. 3408 len. 29]: His burden was slipping sideways , so we lowered it on a chair , and then carried it between us into the kitchen , I holding the legs .
Parsing [sent. 3409 len. 18]: The moment a ray of light fell upon the face , I saw it was my uncle .
Parsing [sent. 3410 len. 8]: I just saved myself from a scream .
Parsing [sent. 3411 len. 13]: My heart stopped , then bumped as if it would break through .
Parsing [sent. 3412 len. 6]: I turned sick and cold .
Parsing [sent. 3413 len. 21]: We laid him on the sofa , but I still held on to the legs ; I was half unconscious .
Parsing [sent. 3414 len. 25]: Martha set me on a chair , and in a moment or two I came to myself , and was able to help her .
Parsing [sent. 3415 len. 35]: She said never a word , but was quite collected , looking every now and then in the face of her cousin with a doglike devotion , but never stopping an instant to gaze .
Parsing [sent. 3416 len. 17]: We got him some brandy first , then some hot milk , and then some soup .
Parsing [sent. 3417 len. 10]: He took a little of everything we offered him .
Parsing [sent. 3418 len. 28]: We did not ask him a single question , but , the moment he revived , carried him up the stair , and laid him in bed .
Parsing [sent. 3419 len. 45]: Once he cast his eyes about , and gave a sigh as of relief to find himself in his own room , then went off into a light doze , which , broken with starts and half-wakings , lasted until next day about noon .
Parsing [sent. 3420 len. 28]: Either John or Martha or I was by his bedside all the time , so that he should not wake without seeing one of us near him .
Parsing [sent. 3421 len. 22]: But the sad thing was , that , when he did wake , he did not seem to come to himself .
Parsing [sent. 3422 len. 37]: He never spoke , but just lay and looked out of his eyes , if indeed it was more than his eyes that looked , if indeed _ he _ looked out of them at all !
Parsing [sent. 3423 len. 8]: `` He has overdone his strength ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3424 len. 6]: we said to each other .
Parsing [sent. 3425 len. 10]: `` He has not been taking care of himself !
Parsing [sent. 3426 len. 12]: -- And then to have lain perhaps hours in the snow !
Parsing [sent. 3427 len. 9]: It 's a wonder he 's alive ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3428 len. 10]: `` He 's nothing but skin and bone ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3429 len. 3]: said Martha .
Parsing [sent. 3430 len. 11]: `` It will take weeks to get him up again !
Parsing [sent. 3431 len. 8]: -- And just look at his clothes !
Parsing [sent. 3432 len. 8]: How ever did he come nigh such !
Parsing [sent. 3433 len. 8]: They 're fit only for a beggar !
Parsing [sent. 3434 len. 10]: They must have knocked him down and stripped him !
Parsing [sent. 3435 len. 8]: -- Look at his poor boots ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3436 len. 17]: she said pitifully , taking up one of them , and stroking it with her hand .
Parsing [sent. 3437 len. 8]: `` He 'll never recover it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3438 len. 8]: `` He will , '' I said .
Parsing [sent. 3439 len. 13]: `` Here are three of us to give him of our life !
Parsing [sent. 3440 len. 14]: He 'll soon be himself again , now that we have him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3441 len. 12]: But my heart was like to break at the sad sight .
Parsing [sent. 3442 len. 10]: I can not put in words what I felt .
Parsing [sent. 3443 len. 24]: `` He would get well much quicker , '' said John , `` if only we could tell him we were married ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3444 len. 18]: `` It will do just as well to invite him to the wedding , '' I answered .
Parsing [sent. 3445 len. 14]: `` I do hope he will give you away , '' said Martha .
Parsing [sent. 3446 len. 21]: `` He will never give me away , '' I returned ; `` but he will give me to John .
Parsing [sent. 3447 len. 16]: And I will not have the wedding until he is able to do that . ''
Parsing [sent. 3448 len. 9]: `` You are right , '' said John .
Parsing [sent. 3449 len. 22]: `` And we must n't ask him anything , or even refer to anything , till he wants to hear . ''
Parsing [sent. 3450 len. 45]: Days went and came , and still he did not seem to know quite where he was ; if he did know , he seemed so content with knowing it , that he did not want to know anything more in heaven or earth .
Parsing [sent. 3451 len. 7]: We grew very anxious about him .
Parsing [sent. 3452 len. 11]: He did not heed a word that Dr. Southwell said .
Parsing [sent. 3453 len. 9]: His mind seemed as exhausted as his body .
Parsing [sent. 3454 len. 25]: The doctor justified John 's resolve , saying he must not be troubled with questions , or the least attempt to rouse his memory .
Parsing [sent. 3455 len. 8]: John was now almost constantly with us .
Parsing [sent. 3456 len. 21]: One day I asked him whether his mother took any notice of his being now so seldom home at night .
Parsing [sent. 3457 len. 28]: He answered she did not ; and , but for being up to her ways , he would imagine she knew nothing at all about his doings .
Parsing [sent. 3458 len. 11]: `` What does she do herself all day long ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3459 len. 3]: I asked .
Parsing [sent. 3460 len. 13]: `` Goes over her books , I imagine , '' he answered .
Parsing [sent. 3461 len. 37]: `` She knows the hour is at hand when she must render account of her stewardship , and I suppose she is getting ready to meet it ; -- how , I would rather not conjecture .
Parsing [sent. 3462 len. 17]: She gives me no trouble now , and I have no wish to trouble her . ''
Parsing [sent. 3463 len. 16]: `` Have you no hope of ever being on filial terms with her again ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3464 len. 3]: I said .
Parsing [sent. 3465 len. 13]: `` There can be few things more unlikely , '' he replied .
Parsing [sent. 3466 len. 31]: I was a little troubled , notwithstanding my knowledge of her and my feeling toward her , that he should regard a complete alienation from his mother with such indifference .
Parsing [sent. 3467 len. 12]: I could not , however , balance the account between them !
Parsing [sent. 3468 len. 29]: If she had a strong claim in the sole fact that she was his mother , how much had she not injured him simply by not being lovable !
Parsing [sent. 3469 len. 23]: Love unpaid is the worst possible debt ; and to make it impossible to pay it , is the worst of wrongs .
Parsing [sent. 3470 len. 18]: But , oh , what a heart-oppression it was , that my uncle had returned so different !
Parsing [sent. 3471 len. 39]: We were glad to have him , but how gladly would we not have let him go again to restore him to himself , even were it never more to rest our eyes upon him in this world !
Parsing [sent. 3472 len. 23]: Dearly as I loved John , it seemed as if nothing could make me happy while my uncle remained as he was .
Parsing [sent. 3473 len. 16]: It was a kind of cold despair to know him such impassable miles from me .
Parsing [sent. 3474 len. 7]: I could not get near him !
Parsing [sent. 3475 len. 27]: I went about all day with a sense -- not merely of loss , but of a loss that gnawed at me with a sickening pain .
Parsing [sent. 3476 len. 4]: He never spoke .
Parsing [sent. 3477 len. 11]: He never said _ little one _ to me now !
Parsing [sent. 3478 len. 12]: he never looked in my eyes as if he loved me !
Parsing [sent. 3479 len. 23]: He was very gentle , never complained , never even frowned , but lay there with a dead question in his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3480 len. 8]: We feared his mind was utterly gone .
Parsing [sent. 3481 len. 18]: By degrees his health returned , but apparently neither his memory , nor his interest in life .
Parsing [sent. 3482 len. 33]: Yet he had a far-away look in his eyes , as if he remembered something , and started and turned at every opening of the door , as if he expected something .
Parsing [sent. 3483 len. 38]: He took to wandering about the yard and the stable and the cow-house ; would gaze for an hour at some animal in its stall ; would watch the men threshing the corn , or twisting straw-ropes .
Parsing [sent. 3484 len. 77]: When Dr. Southwell sent back his horse , it was in great hope that the sight of Death would wake him up ; that he would recognize his old companion , jump on his back , and be well again ; but my uncle only looked at him with a faint admiration , went round him and examined him as if he were a horse he thought of buying , then turned away and left him .
Parsing [sent. 3485 len. 9]: Death was troubled at his treatment of him .
Parsing [sent. 3486 len. 66]: He on his part showed him all the old attention , using every equine blandishment he knew ; but having met with no response , he too turned slowly away , and walked to his stable , Dr. Southwell would gladly have bought him , but neither John nor I would hear of parting with him : he was almost a portion of his master !
Parsing [sent. 3487 len. 24]: My uncle might come to himself any moment : how could we look him in the face if Death was gone from us !
Parsing [sent. 3488 len. 28]: Besides , we loved the horse for his own sake as well as my uncle 's , and John would be but too glad to ride him !
Parsing [sent. 3489 len. 33]: My uncle would wander over the house , up and down , but seemed to prefer the little drawing-room : I made it my special business to keep a good fire there .
Parsing [sent. 3490 len. 15]: He never went to the study ; never opened the door in the chimney-corner .
Parsing [sent. 3491 len. 14]: He very seldom spoke , and seldomer to me than to any other .
Parsing [sent. 3492 len. 8]: It _ was _ a dreary time !
Parsing [sent. 3493 len. 16]: Our very souls had longed for him back , and thus he came to us !
Parsing [sent. 3494 len. 14]: Sorely I wept over the change that had passed upon the good man .
Parsing [sent. 3495 len. 8]: He must have received some terrible shock !
Parsing [sent. 3496 len. 25]: It was just as if his mother , John said , had got hold of him , and put a knife in his heart !
Parsing [sent. 3497 len. 20]: It was well , however , that he was not wandering about the heath , exposed to the elements !
Parsing [sent. 3498 len. 13]: and there was yet time for many a good thing to come !
Parsing [sent. 3499 len. 13]: Where one _ must _ wait , one _ can _ wait .
Parsing [sent. 3500 len. 30]: John had to learn this , for , say what he would , the idea of marrying while my uncle remained in such plight , was to me unendurable .
Parsing [sent. 3501 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXXII .
Parsing [sent. 3502 len. 5]: TWICE TWO IS ONE .
Parsing [sent. 3503 len. 15]: The spring came , but brought little change in the condition of my uncle .
Parsing [sent. 3504 len. 14]: In the month of May , Dr. Southwell advised our taking him abroad .
Parsing [sent. 3505 len. 30]: When we proposed it to him , he passed his hand wearily over his forehead , as if he felt something wrong there , and gave us no reply .
Parsing [sent. 3506 len. 18]: We made our preparations , and when the day arrived , he did not object to go .
Parsing [sent. 3507 len. 54]: We were an odd party : John and I , bachelor and spinster ; my uncle , a silent , moody man , who did whatever we asked him ; and the still , open-eyed Martha Moon , who , I sometimes think , understood more about it all than any of us .
Parsing [sent. 3508 len. 14]: I could talk a little French , John a good deal of German .
Parsing [sent. 3509 len. 15]: When we got to Paris , we found my uncle considerably at home there .
Parsing [sent. 3510 len. 23]: When he cared to speak , he spoke like a native , and was never at a loss for word or phrase .
Parsing [sent. 3511 len. 37]: It was he , indeed , who took us to a quiet little hotel he knew ; and when we were comfortably settled in it , he began to take the lead in all our plans .
Parsing [sent. 3512 len. 42]: By degrees he assumed the care and guidance of the whole party ; and so well did he carry out what he had silently , perhaps almost unconsciously undertaken , that we conceived the greatest hopes of the result to himself .
Parsing [sent. 3513 len. 30]: A mind might lie quiescent so long as it was ministered to , and hedged from cares and duties , but wake up when something was required of it !
Parsing [sent. 3514 len. 41]: No one would have thought anything amiss with my uncle , that heard him giving his orders for the day , or acting cicerone to the little company -- there for his sake , though he did not know it .
Parsing [sent. 3515 len. 17]: How often John and I looked at each other , and how glad were our hearts !
Parsing [sent. 3516 len. 8]: My uncle was fast coming to himself !
Parsing [sent. 3517 len. 9]: It was like watching the dead grow alive .
Parsing [sent. 3518 len. 23]: One day he proposed taking a carriage and a good pair of horses , and driving to Versailles to see the palace .
Parsing [sent. 3519 len. 8]: We agreed , and all went well .
Parsing [sent. 3520 len. 17]: I had not , in my wildest dreams , imagined a place so grand and beautiful .
Parsing [sent. 3521 len. 34]: We wandered about it for hours , and were just tired enough to begin thinking with pleasure of the start homeward , when we found ourselves in a very long , straight corridor .
Parsing [sent. 3522 len. 49]: I was walking alone , a little ahead of the rest ; my uncle was coming along next , but a good way behind me ; a few paces behind my uncle , came John with Martha , to whom he was more scrupulously attentive than to myself .
Parsing [sent. 3523 len. 52]: In front of me was a door , dividing the corridor in two , apparently filled with plain plate-glass , to break the draught without obscuring the effect of the great length of the corridor , which stretched away as far on the other side as we had come on this .
Parsing [sent. 3524 len. 26]: I paused and stood aside , leaning against the wall to wait for my uncle , and gazing listlessly out of a window opposite me .
Parsing [sent. 3525 len. 74]: But as my uncle came nearer to open the door for us , I happened to cast my eyes again upon it , and saw , as it seemed , my uncle coming in the opposite direction ; whence I concluded of course , that I had made a mistake , and that what I had taken for a clear plate of glass , was a mirror , reflecting the corridor behind me .
Parsing [sent. 3526 len. 11]: I looked back at my uncle with a little anxiety .
Parsing [sent. 3527 len. 65]: My reader may remember that , when he came to fetch me from Rising , the day after I was lost on the moor , encountering a mirror at unawares , he started and nearly fell : from this occurrence , and from the absence of mirrors about the house , I had imagined in his life some painful story connected with a mirror .
Parsing [sent. 3528 len. 13]: Once again I saw him start , and then stand like stone .
Parsing [sent. 3529 len. 17]: Almost immediately a marvellous light overspread his countenance , and with a cry he bounded forward .
Parsing [sent. 3530 len. 32]: I looked again at the mirror , and there I saw the self-same light-irradiated countenance coming straight , as was natural , to meet that of which it was the reflection .
Parsing [sent. 3531 len. 80]: Then all at once the solid foundations of fact seemed to melt into vaporous dream , for as I saw the two figures come together , the one in the mirror , the other in the world , and was starting forward to prevent my uncle from shattering the mirror and wounding himself , the figures fell into each other 's arms , and I heard two voices weeping and sobbing , as the substance and the shadow embraced .
Parsing [sent. 3532 len. 29]: Two men had for a moment been deceived like myself : neither glass nor mirror was there -- only the frame from which a swing-door had been removed .
Parsing [sent. 3533 len. 20]: They walked each into the arms of the other , whom they had at first each taken for himself .
Parsing [sent. 3534 len. 49]: They paused in their weeping , held each other at arm 's - length , and gazed as in mute appeal for yet better assurance ; then , smiling like two suns from opposing rain-clouds , fell again each on the other 's neck , and wept anew .
Parsing [sent. 3535 len. 6]: Neither had killed the other !
Parsing [sent. 3536 len. 6]: Neither had lost the other !
Parsing [sent. 3537 len. 12]: The world had been a graveyard ; it was a paradise !
Parsing [sent. 3538 len. 6]: We stood aside in reverence .
Parsing [sent. 3539 len. 12]: Martha Moon 's eyes glowed , but she manifested no surprise .
Parsing [sent. 3540 len. 8]: John and I stared in utter bewilderment .
Parsing [sent. 3541 len. 37]: The two embraced each other , kissed and hugged and patted each other , wept and murmured and laughed , then all at once , with one great sigh between them , grew aware of witnesses .
Parsing [sent. 3542 len. 28]: They were too happy to blush , yet indeed they could not have blushed , so red were they with the fire of heaven 's own delight .
Parsing [sent. 3543 len. 64]: Utterly unembarrassed they turned toward us -- and then came a fresh astonishment , an old and new joy together out of the treasure of the divine house-holder : the uncle of the mirror , radiant with a joy such as I had never before beheld upon human countenance , came straight to me , cried ; `` Ah , little one ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3544 len. 15]: took me in his arms , and embraced me with all the old tenderness .
Parsing [sent. 3545 len. 32]: Then I knew that my own old uncle was the same as ever I had known him , the same as when I used to go to sleep in his arms .
Parsing [sent. 3546 len. 36]: The jubilation that followed , it is impossible for me to describe ; and my husband , who approves of all I have yet written , begs me not to attempt an adumbration of it .
Parsing [sent. 3547 len. 26]: `` It would be a pity , '' he says , `` to end a won race with a tumble down at the post ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3548 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXXIII .
Parsing [sent. 3549 len. 5]: HALF ONE IS ONE .
Parsing [sent. 3550 len. 23]: I am going to give you the whole story , but not this moment ; I want to talk a little first .
Parsing [sent. 3551 len. 10]: I need not say that I had twin uncles .
Parsing [sent. 3552 len. 18]: They were but one man to the world ; to themselves only were they a veritable two .
Parsing [sent. 3553 len. 14]: The word _ twin _ means one of two that once were one .
Parsing [sent. 3554 len. 14]: To _ twin _ means to _ divide _ , they tell me .
Parsing [sent. 3555 len. 13]: The opposite action is , of _ twain _ to make one .
Parsing [sent. 3556 len. 36]: To me as well as the world , I believe , but for the close individual contact of all my life with my uncle Edward , the two would have been but as one man .
Parsing [sent. 3557 len. 32]: I hardly know that I felt any richer at first for having two uncles ; it was long before I should have felt much poorer for the loss of uncle Edmund .
Parsing [sent. 3558 len. 15]: Uncle Edward was to me the substance of which uncle Edmund was the shadow .
Parsing [sent. 3559 len. 19]: But at length I learned to love him dearly through perceiving how dearly my own uncle loved him .
Parsing [sent. 3560 len. 20]: I loved the one because he was what he was , the other because he was not that one .
Parsing [sent. 3561 len. 26]: Creative Love commonly differentiates that it may unite ; in the case of my uncles it seemed only to have divided that it might unite .
Parsing [sent. 3562 len. 31]: I am hardly intelligible to myself ; in my mind at least I have got into a bog of confused metaphysics , out of which it is time I scrambled .
Parsing [sent. 3563 len. 30]: What I would say is this -- that what made the world not care there should be two of them , made the earth a heaven to those two .
Parsing [sent. 3564 len. 17]: By their not being one , they were able to love , and so were one .
Parsing [sent. 3565 len. 19]: Like twin planets they revolved around each other , and in a common orbit around God their sun .
Parsing [sent. 3566 len. 28]: It was a beautiful thing to see how uncle Edmund revived and expanded in the light of his brother 's presence , until he grew plainly himself .
Parsing [sent. 3567 len. 23]: He had suffered more than my own uncle , and had not had an orphan child to love and be loved by .
Parsing [sent. 3568 len. 7]: What a drive home that was !
Parsing [sent. 3569 len. 7]: Paris , anywhere seemed home now !
Parsing [sent. 3570 len. 55]: I had John and my uncles ; John had me and my uncle ; my uncles had each other ; and I suspect , if we could have looked into Martha , we should have seen that she , through her lovely unselfishness , possessed us all more than any one of us another .
Parsing [sent. 3571 len. 9]: Oh the outbursts of gladness on the way !
Parsing [sent. 3572 len. 4]: -- the talks !
Parsing [sent. 3573 len. 4]: -- the silences !
Parsing [sent. 3574 len. 26]: The past fell off like an ugly veil from the true face of things ; the present was sunshine ; the future a rosy cloud .
Parsing [sent. 3575 len. 15]: When we reached our hotel , it was dinner-time , and John ordered champagne .
Parsing [sent. 3576 len. 19]: He and I were hungry as two happy children ; the brothers ate little , and scarcely drank .
Parsing [sent. 3577 len. 15]: They were too full of each other to have room for any animal need .
Parsing [sent. 3578 len. 9]: A strange solemnity crowned and dominated their gladness .
Parsing [sent. 3579 len. 13]: Each was to the other a Lazarus given back from the grave .
Parsing [sent. 3580 len. 15]: But to understand the depth of their rapture , you must know their story .
Parsing [sent. 3581 len. 32]: That of Martha and Mary and Lazarus could not have equalled it but for the presence of the Master , for neither sisters nor brother had done each other any wrong .
Parsing [sent. 3582 len. 33]: They looked to me like men walking in a luminous mist -- a mist of unspeakable suffering radiant with a joy as unspeakable -- the very stuff to fashion into glorious dreams .
Parsing [sent. 3583 len. 22]: When we drew round the fire , for the evenings were chilly , they laid their whole history open to us .
Parsing [sent. 3584 len. 6]: What a tale it was !
Parsing [sent. 3585 len. 7]: and what a telling of it !
Parsing [sent. 3586 len. 23]: My own uncle , Edward , was the principal narrator , but was occasionally helped out by my newer uncle , Edmund .
Parsing [sent. 3587 len. 60]: I had the story already , my reader will remember , in my uncle 's writing , at home : when we returned I read it -- not with the same absorption as if it had come first , but with as much interest , and certainly with the more thorough comprehension that I had listened to it before .
Parsing [sent. 3588 len. 35]: That same written story I shall presently give , supplemented by what , necessarily , my uncle Edmund had to supply , and with some elucidation from the spoken narrative of my uncle Edward .
Parsing [sent. 3589 len. 33]: As the story proceeded , overcome with the horror of the revelation I foresaw , I forgot myself , and cried out -- `` And that woman is John 's mother ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3590 len. 5]: `` Whose mother ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3591 len. 8]: asked uncle Edmund , with scornful curiosity .
Parsing [sent. 3592 len. 9]: `` John Day 's , '' I answered .
Parsing [sent. 3593 len. 7]: `` It can not be ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3594 len. 6]: he cried , blazing up .
Parsing [sent. 3595 len. 8]: `` Are you sure of it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3596 len. 27]: `` I have always been given so to understand , '' replied John for me ; `` but I am by no means sure of it .
Parsing [sent. 3597 len. 9]: I have doubted it a thousand times . ''
Parsing [sent. 3598 len. 4]: `` No wonder !
Parsing [sent. 3599 len. 6]: Then we may go on !
Parsing [sent. 3600 len. 16]: But , indeed , to believe you her son , would be to doubt you !
Parsing [sent. 3601 len. 9]: I _ do n't _ believe it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3602 len. 9]: `` You could not help doubting me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3603 len. 4]: responded John . ''
Parsing [sent. 3604 len. 16]: -- I might be true , though , even if I were her son ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3605 len. 3]: he added .
Parsing [sent. 3606 len. 18]: `` Ed , '' said Edmund to Edward , `` let us lay our heads together ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3607 len. 5]: `` Ready Ed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3608 len. 5]: said Edward to Edmund .
Parsing [sent. 3609 len. 23]: Thereupon they began comparing memories and recollections , -- to find , however , that they had by no means data enough .
Parsing [sent. 3610 len. 20]: One thing was clear to me -- that nothing would be too bad for them to believe of her .
Parsing [sent. 3611 len. 20]: `` She would pick out the eye of a corpse if she thought a sovereign lay behind it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3612 len. 4]: said uncle Edmund .
Parsing [sent. 3613 len. 20]: `` To have the turning over of his rents , -- '' said uncle Edward , and checked himself .
Parsing [sent. 3614 len. 13]: `` Yes -- it would be just one of her devil-tricks ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3615 len. 4]: agreed uncle Edmund .
Parsing [sent. 3616 len. 40]: `` I beg your pardon , John , '' said uncle Edward , as if it were he that had used the phrase , and uncle Edmund nodded to John , as if he had himself made the apology .
Parsing [sent. 3617 len. 4]: John said nothing .
Parsing [sent. 3618 len. 7]: His eyes looked wild with hope .
Parsing [sent. 3619 len. 37]: He felt like one who , having been taught that he is a child of the devil , begins to know that God is his father -- the one discovery worth making by son of man .
Parsing [sent. 3620 len. 18]: Then , at my request , they went on with their story , which I had interrupted .
Parsing [sent. 3621 len. 32]: When it was at length all poured out , and the last drops shaken from the memory of each , there fell a long silence , which my own uncle broke .
Parsing [sent. 3622 len. 9]: `` When shall we start , Ed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3623 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 3624 len. 6]: `` To-morrow , Ed . ''
Parsing [sent. 3625 len. 13]: `` This business of John 's must come first , Ed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3626 len. 7]: `` It shall , Ed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3627 len. 11]: `` You know where you were born , John ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3628 len. 19]: `` On my father 's estate of Rubworth in Gloucestershire , I _ believe _ '' answered John .
Parsing [sent. 3629 len. 13]: `` You must be prepared for the worst , you know ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3630 len. 5]: `` I am prepared .
Parsing [sent. 3631 len. 18]: As Orba told me once , God is my father , whoever my mother may be ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3632 len. 5]: `` That 's right .
Parsing [sent. 3633 len. 5]: Hold by that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3634 len. 9]: said my uncles , as with one breath .
Parsing [sent. 3635 len. 11]: `` Do you know the year you were born ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3636 len. 4]: asked uncle Edmund .
Parsing [sent. 3637 len. 13]: `` My _ mother _ says I was born in 1820 . ''
Parsing [sent. 3638 len. 9]: `` You have not seen the entry ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3639 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 3640 len. 9]: One does not naturally doubt such statements . ''
Parsing [sent. 3641 len. 10]: `` Assuredly not -- until -- '' He paused .
Parsing [sent. 3642 len. 8]: How uncle Edmund had regained his wits !
Parsing [sent. 3643 len. 7]: And how young the brothers looked !
Parsing [sent. 3644 len. 17]: `` You mean , '' said John , `` until he has known my mother ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3645 len. 17]: Now for the story of my twin uncles , mainly as written by my uncle Edward !
Parsing [sent. 3646 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXXIV .
Parsing [sent. 3647 len. 7]: THE STORY OF MY TWIN UNCLES .
Parsing [sent. 3648 len. 9]: `` My brother and I were marvellously like .
Parsing [sent. 3649 len. 23]: Very few of our friends , none of them with certainty , could name either of us apart -- or even together .
Parsing [sent. 3650 len. 17]: Only two persons knew absolutely which either of us was , and those two were ourselves .
Parsing [sent. 3651 len. 17]: Our mother certainly did not -- at least without seeing one or other of our backs .
Parsing [sent. 3652 len. 18]: Even we ourselves have each made the blunder occasionally of calling the other by the wrong name .
Parsing [sent. 3653 len. 25]: Our indistinguishableness was the source of ever-recurring mistake , of constant amusement , of frequent bewilderment , and sometimes of annoyance in the family .
Parsing [sent. 3654 len. 23]: I once heard my father say to a friend , that God had never made two things alike , except his twins .
Parsing [sent. 3655 len. 24]: We two enjoyed the fun of it so much , that we did our best to increase the confusions resulting from our resemblance .
Parsing [sent. 3656 len. 54]: We did not lie , but we dodged and pretended , questioned and looked mysterious , till I verily believe the person concerned , having in himself so vague an idea of our individuality , not unfrequently forgot which he had blamed , or which he had wanted , and became hopelessly muddled .
Parsing [sent. 3657 len. 94]: `` A man might well have started the question what good could lie in the existence of a duality in which the appearance was , if not exactly , yet so nearly identical , that no one but my brother or myself could have pointed out definite differences ; but it could have been started only by an outsider : my brother and I had no doubt concerning the advantage of a duality in which each was the other 's double ; the fact was to us a never ceasing source of delight .
Parsing [sent. 3658 len. 24]: Each seemed to the other created such , expressly that he might love him as a special , individual property of his own .
Parsing [sent. 3659 len. 26]: It was as if the image of Narcissus had risen bodily out of the watery mirror , to be what it had before but seemed .
Parsing [sent. 3660 len. 22]: It was as if we had been made two , that each might love himself , and yet not be selfish .
Parsing [sent. 3661 len. 55]: `` We were almost always together , but sometimes we got into individual scrapes , when -- which will appear to some incredible -- the one accused always accepted punishment without denial or subterfuge or attempt to perplex : it was all one which was the culprit , and which should be the sufferer .
Parsing [sent. 3662 len. 29]: Nor did this indistinction work badly : that the other was just as likely to suffer as the doer of the wrong , wrought rather as a deterrent .
Parsing [sent. 3663 len. 48]: The mode of behaviour may have had its origin in the instinctive perception of the impossibility of proving innocence ; but had we , loving as we did , been capable of truthfully accusing each other , I think we should have been capable of lying also .
Parsing [sent. 3664 len. 19]: The delight of existence lay , embodied and objective to each , in the existence of the other .
Parsing [sent. 3665 len. 23]: `` At school we learned the same things , and only long after did any differences in taste begin to develop themselves .
Parsing [sent. 3666 len. 32]: `` Our brother , elder by five years , who would succeed to the property , had the education my father thought would best fit him for the management of land .
Parsing [sent. 3667 len. 14]: We twins were trained to be lawyer and doctor -- I the doctor .
Parsing [sent. 3668 len. 13]: `` We went to college together , and shared the same rooms .
Parsing [sent. 3669 len. 23]: `` Having finished our separate courses , our father sent us to a German university : he would not have us insular !
Parsing [sent. 3670 len. 16]: `` There we did not work hard , nor was hard work required of us .
Parsing [sent. 3671 len. 23]: We went out a good deal in the evenings , for the students that lived at home in the town were hospitable .
Parsing [sent. 3672 len. 24]: We seemed to be rather popular , owing probably to our singular likeness , which we found was regarded as a serious disadvantage .
Parsing [sent. 3673 len. 28]: The reason of this opinion we never could find , flattering ourselves indeed that what it typified gave us each double the base and double the strength .
Parsing [sent. 3674 len. 9]: `` We had all our friends in common .
Parsing [sent. 3675 len. 12]: Every friend to one of us was a friend to both .
Parsing [sent. 3676 len. 24]: If one met man or woman he was pleased with , he never rested until the other knew that man or woman also .
Parsing [sent. 3677 len. 21]: Our delight in our friends must have been greater than that of other men , because of the constant sharing .
Parsing [sent. 3678 len. 41]: `` Our all but identity of form , our inseparability , our unanimity , and our mutual devotion , were often , although we did not know it , a subject of talk in the social gatherings of the place .
Parsing [sent. 3679 len. 29]: It was more than once or twice openly mooted -- what , in the chances of life , would be likeliest to strain the bond that united us .
Parsing [sent. 3680 len. 21]: Not a few agreed that a terrible catastrophe might almost be expected from what they considered such an unnatural relation .
Parsing [sent. 3681 len. 70]: `` I think you must already be able to foresee from what the first difference between us would arise : discord itself was rooted in the very unison -- for unison it was , not harmony -- of our tastes and instincts ; and will now begin to understand why it was so difficult , indeed impossible for me , not to have a secret from my little one .
Parsing [sent. 3682 len. 38]: `` Among the persons we met in the home-circles of our fellow-students , appeared by and by an English lady -- a young widow , they said , though little in her dress or carriage suggested widowhood .
Parsing [sent. 3683 len. 7]: We met her again and again .
Parsing [sent. 3684 len. 22]: Each thought her the most beautiful woman he had ever seen , but neither was much interested in her at first .
Parsing [sent. 3685 len. 14]: Nor do I believe either would , of himself , ever have been .
Parsing [sent. 3686 len. 50]: Our likings and dislikings always hitherto had gone together , and , left to themselves , would have done so always , I believe ; whence it seems probable that , left to ourselves , we should also have found , when required , a common strength of abnegation .
Parsing [sent. 3687 len. 49]: But in the present case , our feelings were not left to themselves ; the lady gave the initiative , and the dividing regard was born in the one , and had time to establish itself , ere the provoking influence was brought to bear on the other .
Parsing [sent. 3688 len. 19]: `` Within the last few years I have had a visit from an old companion of the period .
Parsing [sent. 3689 len. 45]: I daresay you will remember the German gentleman who amused you with the funny way in which he pronounced certain words -- one of the truest-hearted and truest-tongued men I have ever known : he gave me much unexpected insight into the evil affair .
Parsing [sent. 3690 len. 35]: He had learned certain things from a sister , the knowledge of which , old as the story they concerned by that time was , chiefly moved his coming to England to find me .
Parsing [sent. 3691 len. 86]: `` One evening , he told me , when a number of the ladies we were in the habit of meeting happened to be together without any gentleman present , the talk turned , half in a philosophical , half in a gossipy spirit , upon the consequences that might follow , should two men , bound in such strange fashion as my brother and I , fall in love with the same woman -- a thing not merely possible , but to be expected .
Parsing [sent. 3692 len. 55]: The talk , my friend said , was full of a certain speculative sort of metaphysics which , in the present state of human development , is far from healthy , both because of our incompleteness , and because we are too near to what we seem to know , to judge it aright .
Parsing [sent. 3693 len. 54]: One lady was present -- a lady by us more admired and trusted than any of the rest -- who alone declared a conviction that love of no woman would ever separate us , provided the one fell in love first , and the other knew the fact before he saw the lady .
Parsing [sent. 3694 len. 35]: For , she said , no jealousy would in that case be roused ; and the relation of the brother to his brother and sister would be so close as to satisfy his heart .
Parsing [sent. 3695 len. 34]: In a few days probably he too would fall in love , and his lady in like manner be received by his brother , when they would form a square impregnable to attack .
Parsing [sent. 3696 len. 12]: The theory was a good one , and worthy of realization .
Parsing [sent. 3697 len. 26]: But , alas , the Prince of the Power of the Air was already present in force , in the heart of the English widow !
Parsing [sent. 3698 len. 20]: Young in years , but old in pride and self-confidence , she smiled at the notion of our advocate .
Parsing [sent. 3699 len. 59]: She said that the idea of any such friendship between men was nonsense ; that she knew more about men than some present could be expected to know : their love was but a matter of custom and use ; the moment self took part in the play , it would burst ; it was but a bubble-company !
Parsing [sent. 3700 len. 56]: As for love proper -- she meant the love between man and woman -- its law was the opposite to that of friendship ; its birth and continuance depended on the parties _ not _ getting accustomed to each other ; the less they knew each other , the more they would love each other .
Parsing [sent. 3701 len. 35]: `` Upon this followed much confused talk , during which the English lady declared nothing easier than to prove friendship , or the love of brothers , the kind of thing she had said .
Parsing [sent. 3702 len. 40]: `` Most of the company believed the young widow but talking to show off ; while not a few felt that they desired no nearer acquaintance with one whose words , whatever might be her thoughts , degraded humanity .
Parsing [sent. 3703 len. 24]: The circle was very speedily broken into two segments , one that liked the English lady , and one that almost hated her .
Parsing [sent. 3704 len. 38]: `` From that moment , the English widow set before her the devil-victory of alienating two hearts that loved each other -- and she gained it for a time -- until Death proved stronger than the Devil .
Parsing [sent. 3705 len. 15]: People said we could not be parted : _ she _ would part us !
Parsing [sent. 3706 len. 6]: She began with my brother .
Parsing [sent. 3707 len. 56]: To tell how I know that she began with him , I should have to tell how she began with me , and that I can not do ; for , little one , I dare not let the tale of the treacheries of a bad woman toward an unsuspecting youth , enter your ears .
Parsing [sent. 3708 len. 34]: Suffice it to say , such a woman has well studied those regions of a man 's nature into which , being less divine , the devil in her can easier find entrance .
Parsing [sent. 3709 len. 27]: There , she knows him better than he knows himself ; and makes use of her knowledge , not to elevate , but to degrade him .
Parsing [sent. 3710 len. 11]: She fills him with herself , and her animal influences .
Parsing [sent. 3711 len. 14]: She gets into his self-consciousness beside himself , by means of his self-love .
Parsing [sent. 3712 len. 14]: Through the ever open funnel of his self-greed , she pours in flattery .
Parsing [sent. 3713 len. 11]: By depreciation of others , she hints admiration of himself .
Parsing [sent. 3714 len. 42]: By the slightest motion of a finger , of an eyelid , of her person , she will pay him a homage of which first he can not , then he will not , then he dares not doubt the truth .
Parsing [sent. 3715 len. 37]: Not such a woman only , but almost any silly woman , may speedily make the most ordinary , and hitherto modest youth , imagine himself the peak of creation , the triumph of the Deity .
Parsing [sent. 3716 len. 37]: No man alive is beyond the danger of imagining himself exceptional among men : if such as think well of themselves were right in so doing , truly the world were ill worth God 's making !
Parsing [sent. 3717 len. 14]: He is the wisest who has learned to ` be naught awhile ! '
Parsing [sent. 3718 len. 57]: The silly soul becomes so full of his tempter , and of himself in and through her , that he loses interest in all else , cares for nobody but her , prizes nothing but her regard , broods upon nothing but her favours , looks forward to nothing but again her presence and further favours .
Parsing [sent. 3719 len. 32]: God is nowhere ; fellow-man in the way like a buzzing fly -- else no more to be regarded than a speck of dust neither upon his person nor his garment .
Parsing [sent. 3720 len. 23]: And this terrible disintegration of life rises out of the most wonderful , mysterious , beautiful , and profound relation in humanity !
Parsing [sent. 3721 len. 28]: Its roots go down into the very deeps of God , and out of its foliage creeps the old serpent , and the worm that never dies !
Parsing [sent. 3722 len. 27]: Out of it steams the horror of corruption , wrapt in whose living death a man cries out that God himself can do nothing for him .
Parsing [sent. 3723 len. 30]: It is but the natural result of his making the loveliest of God 's gifts into his God , and worshipping and serving the creature more than the creator .
Parsing [sent. 3724 len. 12]: Oh my child , it is a terrible thing to be !
Parsing [sent. 3725 len. 21]: Except he knows God the saviour , man stands face to face with a torturing enigma , hopeless of solution !
Parsing [sent. 3726 len. 20]: `` The woman sought and found the enemy , my false self , in the house of my life .
Parsing [sent. 3727 len. 14]: To that she gave herself , as if she gave herself to me .
Parsing [sent. 3728 len. 9]: Oh , how she made me love her !
Parsing [sent. 3729 len. 22]: -- if that be love which is a deification of self , the foul worship of one 's own paltry being !
Parsing [sent. 3730 len. 12]: -- and that when most it seems swallowed up and lost !
Parsing [sent. 3731 len. 7]: No , it is not love !
Parsing [sent. 3732 len. 5]: Does love make ashamed ?
Parsing [sent. 3733 len. 22]: The memories of it may be full of pain , but can the soul ever turn from love with sick contempt ?
Parsing [sent. 3734 len. 13]: That which at length is loathed , can never have been loved !
Parsing [sent. 3735 len. 22]: `` Of my brother she would speak as of a poor creature not for a moment to be compared with myself .
Parsing [sent. 3736 len. 66]: How I could have believed her true when she spoke thus , knowing that in the mirror I could not have told myself from my brother , knowing also that our minds , tastes , and faculties bore as strong a resemblance as our bodies , I can not tell , but she fooled me to a fool through the indwelling folly of my self-love .
Parsing [sent. 3737 len. 42]: At other times , wishing to tighten the bonds of my thraldom that she might the better work her evil end , proving herself a powerful devil , she would rouse my jealousy by some sign of strong admiration of Edmund .
Parsing [sent. 3738 len. 11]: She must have acted the same way with my brother .
Parsing [sent. 3739 len. 49]: I saw him enslaved just as I -- knew we were faring alike -- knew the very thoughts as well as feelings in his heart , and instead of being consumed with sorrow , chuckled at the _ knowledge _ that _ I _ was the favoured one !
Parsing [sent. 3740 len. 25]: I suspect now that she showed him more favour than myself , and taught him to put on the look of the hopeless one .
Parsing [sent. 3741 len. 19]: I fancied I caught at times a covert flash in his eye : he knew what he knew !
Parsing [sent. 3742 len. 15]: If so , poor Edmund , thou hadst the worst of it every way !
Parsing [sent. 3743 len. 18]: `` Shall I ever get her kisses off my lips , her poison out of my brain !
Parsing [sent. 3744 len. 21]: From my heart , her image was burned in a moment , as utterly as if by years of hell !
Parsing [sent. 3745 len. 18]: `` The estrangement between us was sudden ; there were degrees only in the widening of it .
Parsing [sent. 3746 len. 6]: First came embarrassment at meeting .
Parsing [sent. 3747 len. 13]: Then all commerce of wish , thought , and speculation , ended .
Parsing [sent. 3748 len. 19]: There was no more merrymaking jugglery with identity ; each was himself only , and for himself alone .
Parsing [sent. 3749 len. 5]: Gone was all brother-gladness .
Parsing [sent. 3750 len. 8]: We avoided each other more and more .
Parsing [sent. 3751 len. 11]: When we must meet , we made haste to part .
Parsing [sent. 3752 len. 6]: Heaven was gone from home .
Parsing [sent. 3753 len. 21]: Each yet felt the same way toward the other , but it was the way of repelling , not drawing .
Parsing [sent. 3754 len. 26]: When we passed in the street , it was with a look that said , or at least meant -- ` You are my brother !
Parsing [sent. 3755 len. 7]: I do n't want you ! '
Parsing [sent. 3756 len. 9]: We ceased even to nod to each other .
Parsing [sent. 3757 len. 9]: Still in our separation we could not separate .
Parsing [sent. 3758 len. 17]: Each took a room in another part of the town , but under the same pseudonym .
Parsing [sent. 3759 len. 14]: Our common lodging was first deserted , then formally given up by each .
Parsing [sent. 3760 len. 21]: Always what one did , that did the other , though no longer intending to act in consort with him .
Parsing [sent. 3761 len. 21]: He could not help it though he tried , for the other tried also , and did the same thing .
Parsing [sent. 3762 len. 51]: One of us might for months have played the part of both without detection -- especially if it had been understood that we had parted company ; but I think it was never suspected , although now we were rarely for a moment together , and still more rarely spoke .
Parsing [sent. 3763 len. 13]: A few weeks sufficed to bring us to the verge of madness .
Parsing [sent. 3764 len. 23]: `` To this day I doubt if the woman , our common disease , knew the one of us from the other .
Parsing [sent. 3765 len. 27]: That in any part of her being there was the least approach to a genuine womanly interest in either of us , I do not believe .
Parsing [sent. 3766 len. 10]: I am very sure she never cared for me .
Parsing [sent. 3767 len. 54]: Preference I can not think possible ; she could not , it seems to me , have felt anything for one of us without feeling the same for both ; I do not see how , with all she knew of us , we could have made two impressions upon her moral sensorium .
Parsing [sent. 3768 len. 20]: `` It was at length the height of summer , and every one sought change of scene and air .
Parsing [sent. 3769 len. 22]: It was time for us to go home ; but I wrote to my father , and got longer leave . ''
Parsing [sent. 3770 len. 29]: `` I wrote too , '' interposed my uncle Edmund at this point of the story , when my own uncle was telling it that evening in Paris .
Parsing [sent. 3771 len. 17]: `` The day after the date of his answer to my letter , my father died .
Parsing [sent. 3772 len. 51]: But Edmund and I were already on our way , by different routes , to the mountain-village whither the lady had preceded us ; and having , in our infatuation , left no address , my brother never saw the letter announcing our loss , and I not for months .
Parsing [sent. 3773 len. 21]: `` A few weeks more , and our elder brother , who had always been delicate , followed our father .
Parsing [sent. 3774 len. 10]: This also remained for a time unknown to me .
Parsing [sent. 3775 len. 19]: My mother had died many years before , and we had now scarce a relation in the world .
Parsing [sent. 3776 len. 11]: Martha Moon is the nearest relative you and I have .
Parsing [sent. 3777 len. 27]: Besides her and you , there were left therefore of the family but myself and your uncle Edmund -- both absorbed in the same worthless woman .
Parsing [sent. 3778 len. 9]: `` At the village there were two hostelries .
Parsing [sent. 3779 len. 26]: I thought my brother would go to the better ; he thought I would go to the better ; so we met at the worse !
Parsing [sent. 3780 len. 26]: I remember a sort of grin on his face when we saw each other , and have no doubt the same grin was on mine .
Parsing [sent. 3781 len. 12]: We always did the same thing , just as of old .
Parsing [sent. 3782 len. 20]: The next morning we set out , I need hardly say each by himself , to find the lady .
Parsing [sent. 3783 len. 32]: `` She had rented a small chalet on the banks of a swift mountain-stream , and thither , for a week or so , we went every day , often encountering .
Parsing [sent. 3784 len. 20]: The efforts we made to avoid each other being similar and simultaneous , they oftener resulted in our meeting .
Parsing [sent. 3785 len. 25]: When one did nothing , the other generally did nothing also , and when one schemed , the other also schemed , and similarly .
Parsing [sent. 3786 len. 29]: Thus what had been the greatest pleasure of our peculiar relation , our mental and moral resemblance , namely , became a large factor in our mutual hate .
Parsing [sent. 3787 len. 48]: For with self-loathing shame , and a misery that makes me curse the day I was born , I confess that for a time I hated the brother of my heart ; and I have but too good ground for believing that he also hated me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3788 len. 4]: `` I did !
Parsing [sent. 3789 len. 4]: I did ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3790 len. 71]: cried uncle Edmund , when my own uncle , in his verbal narrative , mentioned his belief that his brother hated him ; whereupon uncle Edward turned to me , saying -- `` Is it not terrible , my little one , that out of a passion called by the same name with that which binds you and John Day , the hellish smoke of such a hate should arise !
Parsing [sent. 3791 len. 5]: God must understand it !
Parsing [sent. 3792 len. 13]: that is a comfort : in vain I seek to sound it .
Parsing [sent. 3793 len. 12]: Even then I knew that I dwelt in an evil house .
Parsing [sent. 3794 len. 21]: Amid the highest of such hopes as the woman roused in me , I scented the vapours of the pit .
Parsing [sent. 3795 len. 29]: I was haunted by the dim shape of the coming hour when I should hate the woman that enthralled me , more than ever I had loved her .
Parsing [sent. 3796 len. 15]: The greater sinner I am , that I yet yielded her dominion over me .
Parsing [sent. 3797 len. 42]: I was the willing slave of a woman who sought nothing but the consciousness of power ; who , to the indulgence of that vilest of passions , would sacrifice the lives , the loves , the very souls of men !
Parsing [sent. 3798 len. 12]: She lived to separate , where Jesus died to make one !
Parsing [sent. 3799 len. 13]: How weak and unworthy was I to be caught in her snares !
Parsing [sent. 3800 len. 10]: how wicked and vile not to tear myself loose !
Parsing [sent. 3801 len. 17]: The woman whose touch would defile the Pharisee , is pure beside such a woman ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3802 len. 6]: I return to his manuscript .
Parsing [sent. 3803 len. 60]: `` The lady must have had plenty of money , and she loved company and show ; I can not but think , therefore , that she had her design in choosing such a solitary place : its loveliness would subserve her intent of enthralling thoroughly heart and soul and brain of the fools she had in her toils .
Parsing [sent. 3804 len. 31]: I doubt , however , if the fools were alive to any beauty but hers , if they were not dead to the wavings of God 's garment about them .
Parsing [sent. 3805 len. 37]: Was I ever truly aware of the presence of those peaks that dwelt alone with their whiteness in the desert of the sky -- awfully alone -- of the world , but not with the world ?
Parsing [sent. 3806 len. 38]: I think we saw nothing save with our bodily eyes , and very little with them ; for we were blinded by a passion fitter to wander the halls of Eblis , than the palaces of God .
Parsing [sent. 3807 len. 32]: `` The chalet stood in a little valley , high in the mountains , whose surface was gently undulating , with here and there the rocks breaking through its rich-flowering meadows .
Parsing [sent. 3808 len. 29]: Down the middle of it ran the deep swift stream , swift with the weight of its fullness , as well as the steep slope of its descent .
Parsing [sent. 3809 len. 24]: It was not more than seven or eight feet across , but a great body of water went rushing along its deep course .
Parsing [sent. 3810 len. 44]: About a quarter of a mile from the chalet , it reached the first of a series of falls of moderate height and slope , after which it divided into a number of channels , mostly shallow , in a wide pebbly torrent-bed .
Parsing [sent. 3811 len. 51]: These , a little lower down , reunited into a narrower and yet swifter stream -- a small fierce river , which presently , at one reckless bound , shot into the air , to tumble to a valley a thousand feet below , shattered into spray as it fell .
Parsing [sent. 3812 len. 6]: `` The chalet stood alone .
Parsing [sent. 3813 len. 20]: The village was at no great distance , but not a house was visible from any of its windows .
Parsing [sent. 3814 len. 5]: It had no garden .
Parsing [sent. 3815 len. 48]: The meadow , one blaze of colour , softened by the green of the mingling grass , came up to its wooden walls , and stretched from them down to the rocky bank of the river , in many parts to the very water 's - edge .
Parsing [sent. 3816 len. 12]: The chalet stood like a yellow rock in a green sea .
Parsing [sent. 3817 len. 12]: The meadow was the drawing-room where the lady generally received us .
Parsing [sent. 3818 len. 38]: `` One lovely evening , I strolled out of the hostelry , and went walking up the road that led to the village of Auerbach , so named from the stream and the meadow I have described .
Parsing [sent. 3819 len. 11]: The moon was up , and promised the loveliest night .
Parsing [sent. 3820 len. 37]: I was in no haste , for the lady had , in our common hearing , said , she was going to pass that night with a friend , in a town some ten miles away .
Parsing [sent. 3821 len. 32]: I dawdled along therefore , thinking only to greet the place , walk with the stream , and lie in the meadow , sacred with the shadow of her demonian presence .
Parsing [sent. 3822 len. 47]: Quit of the restless hope of seeing her , I found myself taking some little pleasure in the things about me , and spent two hours on the way , amid the sound of rushing water , now swelling , now sinking , all the time .
Parsing [sent. 3823 len. 14]: `` It had not crossed me to wonder where my brother might be .
Parsing [sent. 3824 len. 12]: I banished the thought of him as often as it intruded .
Parsing [sent. 3825 len. 26]: Not able to help meeting , we had almost given up avoiding each other ; but when we met , our desire was to part .
Parsing [sent. 3826 len. 21]: I do not know that , apart , we had ever yet felt actual hate , either to the other .
Parsing [sent. 3827 len. 8]: `` The road led through the village .
Parsing [sent. 3828 len. 4]: It was asleep .
Parsing [sent. 3829 len. 11]: I remember a gleam in just one of the houses .
Parsing [sent. 3830 len. 13]: The moonlight seemed to have drowned all the lamps of the world .
Parsing [sent. 3831 len. 37]: I came to the stream , rushing cold from its far-off glacier-mother , crossed it , and went down the bank opposite the chalet : I had taken a fancy to see it from that side .
Parsing [sent. 3832 len. 18]: Glittering and glancing under the moon , the wild little river rushed joyous to its fearful fall .
Parsing [sent. 3833 len. 20]: A short distance away , it was even now falling -- falling from off the face of the world !
Parsing [sent. 3834 len. 33]: This moment it was falling from my very feet into the void -- falling , falling , unupheld , down , down , through the moonlight , to the ghastly rock-foot below !
Parsing [sent. 3835 len. 6]: `` The chalet seemed deserted .
Parsing [sent. 3836 len. 15]: With the same woefully desolate look , it constantly comes back in my dreams .
Parsing [sent. 3837 len. 7]: I went farther down the valley .
Parsing [sent. 3838 len. 10]: The full-rushing stream went with me like a dog .
Parsing [sent. 3839 len. 14]: It made no murmur , only a low gurgle as it shot along .
Parsing [sent. 3840 len. 12]: It seemed to draw me with it to its last leap .
Parsing [sent. 3841 len. 19]: As I looked at its swiftness , I thought how hard it would be to get out of .
Parsing [sent. 3842 len. 12]: The swiftness of it comes to me yet in my dreams .
Parsing [sent. 3843 len. 39]: `` I came to a familiar rock , which , part of the bank whereon I walked , rose some six or seven feet above the meadow , just opposite a little hollow where the lady oftenest sat .
Parsing [sent. 3844 len. 26]: Two were on the grass together , one a lady seated , the other a man , with his head in the lady 's lap .
Parsing [sent. 3845 len. 22]: I gave a leap as if a bullet had gone through my heart , then instinctively drew back behind the rock .
Parsing [sent. 3846 len. 12]: There I came to myself , and began to take courage .
Parsing [sent. 3847 len. 14]: She had gone away for the night : it could not be she !
Parsing [sent. 3848 len. 3]: I peeped .
Parsing [sent. 3849 len. 14]: The man had raised his head , and was leaning on his elbow .
Parsing [sent. 3850 len. 8]: It was Edmund , I was certain !
Parsing [sent. 3851 len. 6]: She stooped and kissed him .
Parsing [sent. 3852 len. 24]: I scrambled to the top of the rock , and sprang across the stream , which ran below me like a flooded millrace .
Parsing [sent. 3853 len. 17]: Would to God I had missed the bank , and been swept to the great fall !
Parsing [sent. 3854 len. 12]: I was careless , and when I lighted , I fell .
Parsing [sent. 3855 len. 19]: Her clear mocking laugh rang through the air , and echoed from the scoop of some still mountain .
Parsing [sent. 3856 len. 11]: When I rose , they were on their feet . ''
Parsing [sent. 3857 len. 6]: ` Quite a chamois-spring ! '
Parsing [sent. 3858 len. 6]: remarked the lady with derision .
Parsing [sent. 3859 len. 9]: `` She saw the last moment was come .
Parsing [sent. 3860 len. 8]: Neither of us two spoke . '' '
Parsing [sent. 3861 len. 29]: I told you , ' she said , ` neither of you was to trouble me to-night : you have paid no regard to my wish for quiet !
Parsing [sent. 3862 len. 8]: It is time the foolery should end !
Parsing [sent. 3863 len. 6]: I am weary of it .
Parsing [sent. 3864 len. 31]: A woman can not marry a double man -- or half a man either -- without at least being able to tell which is which of the two halves ! '
Parsing [sent. 3865 len. 14]: `` She ended with a toneless laugh , in which my brother joined .
Parsing [sent. 3866 len. 40]: She turned upon him with a pitiless mockery which , I see now , must have left in his mind the conviction that she had been but making game of him ; while I never doubted myself the dupe .
Parsing [sent. 3867 len. 33]: Not once had she received me as I now saw her : though the night was warm , her deshabille was yet a somewhat prodigal unmasking of her beauty to the moon !
Parsing [sent. 3868 len. 18]: The conviction in each of us was , that she and the other were laughing at him .
Parsing [sent. 3869 len. 16]: `` We locked in a deadly struggle , with what object I can not tell .
Parsing [sent. 3870 len. 11]: I do not believe either of us had an object .
Parsing [sent. 3871 len. 20]: It was a mere blind conflict of pointless enmity , in which each cared but to overpower the other .
Parsing [sent. 3872 len. 20]: Which first laid hold , which , if either , began to drag , I have not a suspicion .
Parsing [sent. 3873 len. 35]: The next thing I know is , we were in the water , each in the grasp of the other , now rolling , now sweeping , now tumbling along , in deadly embrace .
Parsing [sent. 3874 len. 20]: `` The shock of the ice-cold water , and the sense of our danger , brought me to myself .
Parsing [sent. 3875 len. 12]: I let my brother go , but he clutched me still .
Parsing [sent. 3876 len. 9]: Down we shot together toward the sheer descent .
Parsing [sent. 3877 len. 5]: Already we seemed falling .
Parsing [sent. 3878 len. 7]: The terror of it over-mastered me .
Parsing [sent. 3879 len. 17]: It was not the crash I feared , but the stayless rush through the whistling emptiness .
Parsing [sent. 3880 len. 36]: In the agony of my despair , I pushed him from me with all my strength , striking at him a fierce , wild , aimless blow -- the only blow struck in the wrestle .
Parsing [sent. 3881 len. 4]: His hold relaxed .
Parsing [sent. 3882 len. 6]: I remember nothing more . ''
Parsing [sent. 3883 len. 14]: At this point of the verbal narrative , my uncle Edmund again spoke .
Parsing [sent. 3884 len. 23]: `` You never struck me , Ed , '' he cried ; `` or if you did , I was already senseless .
Parsing [sent. 3885 len. 8]: I remember nothing of the water . ''
Parsing [sent. 3886 len. 22]: `` When I came to myself , '' the manuscript goes on , `` I was lying in a pebbly shoal .
Parsing [sent. 3887 len. 7]: The moon was aloft in heaven .
Parsing [sent. 3888 len. 15]: I was cold to the heart , cold to the marrow of my bones .
Parsing [sent. 3889 len. 14]: I could move neither hand nor foot , and thought I was dead .
Parsing [sent. 3890 len. 32]: By slow degrees a little power came back , and I managed at length , after much agonizing effort , to get up on my feet -- only to fall again .
Parsing [sent. 3891 len. 35]: After several such failures , I found myself capable of dragging myself along like a serpent , and so got out of the water , and on the next endeavour was able to stand .
Parsing [sent. 3892 len. 39]: I had forgotten everything ; but when my eyes fell on the darting torrent , I remembered all -- not as a fact , but as a terrible dream from which I thanked heaven I had come awake .
Parsing [sent. 3893 len. 19]: `` But as I tottered along , I came slowly to myself , and a fearful doubt awoke .
Parsing [sent. 3894 len. 12]: If it was a dream , where had I dreamt it ?
Parsing [sent. 3895 len. 11]: How had I come to wake where I found myself ?
Parsing [sent. 3896 len. 9]: How had the dream turned real about me ?
Parsing [sent. 3897 len. 8]: Where was I last in my remembrance ?
Parsing [sent. 3898 len. 5]: Where was my brother ?
Parsing [sent. 3899 len. 8]: Where was the lady in the moonlight ?
Parsing [sent. 3900 len. 8]: No , it was not a dream !
Parsing [sent. 3901 len. 16]: If my brother had not got out of the water , I was his murderer !
Parsing [sent. 3902 len. 5]: I had struck him !
Parsing [sent. 3903 len. 8]: -- Oh , the horror of it !
Parsing [sent. 3904 len. 15]: If only I could stop dreaming it -- three times almost every night ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3905 len. 24]: Again uncle Edmund interposed -- not altogether logically : `` I tell you , I do n't believe you struck me , Ed !
Parsing [sent. 3906 len. 18]: And you must remember , neither of us would have got out if you had n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3907 len. 9]: `` You might have let me go ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3908 len. 4]: said the other .
Parsing [sent. 3909 len. 11]: `` On the way down the Degenfall , perhaps ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3910 len. 5]: rejoined uncle Edmund . ''
Parsing [sent. 3911 len. 20]: -- I believe it was that blow brought me to my senses , and made me get out ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3912 len. 7]: `` Thank you , Ed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3913 len. 4]: said uncle Edward .
Parsing [sent. 3914 len. 8]: Once more I write from the manuscript .
Parsing [sent. 3915 len. 13]: `` I said to myself he _ must _ have got out !
Parsing [sent. 3916 len. 12]: It could not be that I had drowned my own brother !
Parsing [sent. 3917 len. 10]: Such a ghastly thing could not have been permitted !
Parsing [sent. 3918 len. 8]: It was too terrible to be possible !
Parsing [sent. 3919 len. 14]: `` How , then , had we been living the last few months ?
Parsing [sent. 3920 len. 6]: What brothers had we been ?
Parsing [sent. 3921 len. 7]: Had we been loving one another ?
Parsing [sent. 3922 len. 9]: Had I been a neighbour to my nearest ?
Parsing [sent. 3923 len. 9]: Had I been a brother to my twin ?
Parsing [sent. 3924 len. 10]: Was not murder the natural outcome of it all ?
Parsing [sent. 3925 len. 10]: He that loveth not his brother is a murderer !
Parsing [sent. 3926 len. 19]: If so , where the good of saving me from being in deed what I was in nature ?
Parsing [sent. 3927 len. 11]: I had cast off my brother for a treacherous woman !
Parsing [sent. 3928 len. 7]: My very thought sickened within me .
Parsing [sent. 3929 len. 12]: `` My soul seemed to grow luminous , and understand everything .
Parsing [sent. 3930 len. 9]: I saw my whole behaviour as it was .
Parsing [sent. 3931 len. 51]: The scales fell from my inward eyes , and there came a sudden , total , and absolute revulsion in my conscious self -- like what takes place , I presume , at the day of judgment , when the God in every man sits in judgment upon the man .
Parsing [sent. 3932 len. 39]: Had the gate of heaven stood wide open , neither angel with flaming sword , nor Peter with the keys to dispute my entrance , I would have turned away from it , and sought the deepest hell .
Parsing [sent. 3933 len. 24]: I loathed the woman and myself ; in my heart the sealed fountain of old affection had broken out , and flooded it .
Parsing [sent. 3934 len. 34]: `` All the time this thinking went on , I was crawling slowly up the endless river toward the chalet , driven by a hope inconsistent with what I knew of my brother .
Parsing [sent. 3935 len. 31]: What I felt , he , if he were alive , must be feeling also : how then could I say to myself that I should find him with her ?
Parsing [sent. 3936 len. 17]: It was the last dying hope that I had not killed him that thus fooled me .
Parsing [sent. 3937 len. 11]: ` She will be warming him in her bosom ! '
Parsing [sent. 3938 len. 3]: I said .
Parsing [sent. 3939 len. 15]: But at the very touch , the idea turned and presented its opposite pole .
Parsing [sent. 3940 len. 5]: ` Good God ! '
Parsing [sent. 3941 len. 14]: I cried in my heart , ` how shall I compass his deliverance ?
Parsing [sent. 3942 len. 21]: Better he lay at the bottom of the fall , than lived to be devoured by that serpent of hell !
Parsing [sent. 3943 len. 18]: I will go straight to the den of the monster , and demand my brother ! ' ''
Parsing [sent. 3944 len. 15]: But to see the eyes of uncle Edmund at this point of the story !
Parsing [sent. 3945 len. 8]: `` At last I approached the chalet .
Parsing [sent. 3946 len. 4]: All was still .
Parsing [sent. 3947 len. 12]: A handkerchief lay on the grass , white in the moonlight .
Parsing [sent. 3948 len. 14]: I went up to it , hoping to find it my brother 's .
Parsing [sent. 3949 len. 6]: It was the lady 's .
Parsing [sent. 3950 len. 10]: I flung it from me like a filthy rag .
Parsing [sent. 3951 len. 15]: `` What was the passion worth which in a moment could die so utterly !
Parsing [sent. 3952 len. 7]: `` I turned to the house .
Parsing [sent. 3953 len. 14]: I would tear him from her : he was mine , not hers !
Parsing [sent. 3954 len. 7]: `` My wits were nigh gone .
Parsing [sent. 3955 len. 17]: I thought the moonlight was dissolving the chalet , that the two within might escape me .
Parsing [sent. 3956 len. 8]: I held it fast with my eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3957 len. 12]: The moon drew back : she only possessed and filled it !
Parsing [sent. 3958 len. 22]: No ; the moon was too pure : she but shone reflected from the windows ; she would not go in !
Parsing [sent. 3959 len. 7]: _ I _ would go in !
Parsing [sent. 3960 len. 4]: I was Justice !
Parsing [sent. 3961 len. 6]: The woman was a thief !
Parsing [sent. 3962 len. 13]: She had broken into the house of life , and was stealing !
Parsing [sent. 3963 len. 12]: `` I stood for a moment looking up at her window .
Parsing [sent. 3964 len. 7]: There was neither motion nor sound .
Parsing [sent. 3965 len. 11]: Was she gone away , and my brother with her ?
Parsing [sent. 3966 len. 19]: Could she be in bed and asleep , after seeing us swept down the river to the Degenfall !
Parsing [sent. 3967 len. 15]: Could he be with her and at rest , believing me dashed to pieces ?
Parsing [sent. 3968 len. 5]: I must be resolved !
Parsing [sent. 3969 len. 15]: The door was not bolted ; I stole up the stair to her chamber .
Parsing [sent. 3970 len. 8]: The door of it was wide open .
Parsing [sent. 3971 len. 6]: I entered , and stood .
Parsing [sent. 3972 len. 15]: The moon filled the tiny room with a clear , sharp-edged , pale-yellow light .
Parsing [sent. 3973 len. 14]: She lay asleep , lovely to look at as an angel of God .
Parsing [sent. 3974 len. 43]: Her hair , part of it thrown across the top-rail of the little iron bed , streamed out on each side over the pillow , and in the midst of it lay her face , a radiant isle in a dark sea .
Parsing [sent. 3975 len. 5]: I stood and gazed .
Parsing [sent. 3976 len. 5]: Fascinated by her beauty ?
Parsing [sent. 3977 len. 3]: God forbid !
Parsing [sent. 3978 len. 25]: I was fascinated by the awful incongruity between that face , pure as the moonlight , and the charnel-house that lay unseen behind it .
Parsing [sent. 3979 len. 16]: She was to me , henceforth , not a woman , but a live Death .
Parsing [sent. 3980 len. 19]: I had no sense of sacredness , such as always in the chamber even of a little girl .
Parsing [sent. 3981 len. 4]: How should I ?
Parsing [sent. 3982 len. 10]: It was no chamber ; it was a den .
Parsing [sent. 3983 len. 10]: She was no woman , but a female monster .
Parsing [sent. 3984 len. 5]: I stood and gazed .
Parsing [sent. 3985 len. 10]: `` My presence was more potent than I knew .
Parsing [sent. 3986 len. 11]: She opened her eyes -- opened them straight into mine .
Parsing [sent. 3987 len. 19]: All the colour sank away out of her face , and it stiffened to that of a corpse .
Parsing [sent. 3988 len. 16]: With the staring eyes of one strangled , she lay as motionless as I stood .
Parsing [sent. 3989 len. 25]: I moved not an inch , spoke not a word , drew not a step nearer , retreated not a hair 's - breadth .
Parsing [sent. 3990 len. 6]: Motion was taken from me .
Parsing [sent. 3991 len. 17]: Was it hate that fixed my eyes on hers , and turned my limbs into marble ?
Parsing [sent. 3992 len. 12]: It certainly was not love , but neither was it hate .
Parsing [sent. 3993 len. 47]: `` Agony had been burrowing in me like a mole ; the half of what I felt I have not told you : I came to find my brother , and found only , in a sweet sleep , the woman who had just killed him .
Parsing [sent. 3994 len. 52]: The bewilderment , of it all , with my long insensibility and wet garments , had taken from me either the power of motion or of volition , I do not know which : speechless in the moonlight , I must have looked to the wretched woman both ghostly and ghastly .
Parsing [sent. 3995 len. 25]: `` Two or three long moments she gazed with those horror-struck eyes ; then a frightful shriek broke from her drawn , death-like lips .
Parsing [sent. 3996 len. 27]: She who could sleep after turning love into hate , life into death , would have fled into hell to escape the eyes of the dead !
Parsing [sent. 3997 len. 5]: Insensibility is not courage .
Parsing [sent. 3998 len. 24]: Wake in the scornfullest mortal the conviction that one of the disembodied stands before him , and he will shiver like an aspen-leaf .
Parsing [sent. 3999 len. 4]: Scream followed scream .
Parsing [sent. 4000 len. 14]: Volition or strength , whichever it was that had left me , returned .
Parsing [sent. 4001 len. 28]: I backed from the room , went noiseless from the house , and fled , as if she had been the ghost , and I the mortal .
Parsing [sent. 4002 len. 13]: Would I had been the spectre for which she took me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4003 len. 6]: Here uncle Edward again spoke .
Parsing [sent. 4004 len. 10]: `` Small wonder she screamed , the wretch ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4005 len. 15]: he cried : `` that was her second dose of the horrible that night !
Parsing [sent. 4006 len. 13]: You found the door unbolted because I had been there before you .
Parsing [sent. 4007 len. 14]: I too entered her room , and saw her asleep as you describe .
Parsing [sent. 4008 len. 18]: I went close to her bedside , and cried out , ` Where is my brother ? '
Parsing [sent. 4009 len. 12]: She woke , and fainted , and I left her . ''
Parsing [sent. 4010 len. 34]: `` Then , '' said I , `` when she came to herself , thinking she had had a bad dream , she rearranged her hair , and went to sleep again ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4011 len. 11]: `` Just so , I daresay , little one ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4012 len. 4]: answered uncle Edward .
Parsing [sent. 4013 len. 27]: `` I had not yet begun to think what I should do , when I found myself at our little inn , '' the manuscript continues .
Parsing [sent. 4014 len. 27]: `` No idea of danger to myself awoke in my mind , nor was there any cause to heed such an idea , had it come .
Parsing [sent. 4015 len. 11]: Nobody there knew the one from the other of us .
Parsing [sent. 4016 len. 10]: Not many would know there were two of us .
Parsing [sent. 4017 len. 16]: Any one who saw me twice , might well think he had seen us both .
Parsing [sent. 4018 len. 26]: If my brother 's body were found in the valley stream , it was not likely to be recognized , or to be indeed recognizable .
Parsing [sent. 4019 len. 20]: The only one who could tell what happened at the top of the fall , would hardly volunteer information .
Parsing [sent. 4020 len. 25]: But , while I knew myself my brother 's murderer , I thought no more of these sheltering facts than I did of danger .
Parsing [sent. 4021 len. 14]: I made it no secret that my brother had gone over the fall .
Parsing [sent. 4022 len. 31]: I went to the foot of the cataract , thence to search and inquire all down the stream , but no one had heard of any dead body being found .
Parsing [sent. 4023 len. 22]: They told me that the poor gentleman must , before morning , have been far on his way to the Danube .
Parsing [sent. 4024 len. 29]: `` Giving up the quest in despair , I resigned myself to a torture which has hitherto come no nearer expending itself than the consuming fire of God .
Parsing [sent. 4025 len. 62]: `` I dared not carry home the terrible news , which must either involve me in lying , or elicit such confession as would multiply tenfold my father 's anguish , and was in utter perplexity what to do , when it occurred to me that I ought to inquire after letters at the lodging where last we had lived together .
Parsing [sent. 4026 len. 22]: Then first I learned that both my father and my elder brother , your father , little one , were dead .
Parsing [sent. 4027 len. 15]: `` The sense of guilt had not destroyed in me the sense of duty .
Parsing [sent. 4028 len. 27]: I did not care what became of the property , but I did care for my brother 's child , and the interests of her succession .
Parsing [sent. 4029 len. 17]: `` Your father had all his life been delicate , and had suffered not a little .
Parsing [sent. 4030 len. 50]: When your mother died , about a year after their marriage , leaving us you , it soon grew plain to see that , while he loved you dearly , and was yet more friendly to all about him than before , his heart had given up the world .
Parsing [sent. 4031 len. 38]: When I knew he was gone , I shed more tears over him than I had yet shed over my twin : the worm that never dies made my brain too hot to weep much for Edmund .
Parsing [sent. 4032 len. 26]: Then first I saw that my elder brother had been a brother indeed ; and that we twins had never been real to each other .
Parsing [sent. 4033 len. 38]: I saw what nothing but self-loathing would ever have brought me to see , that my love to Edmund had not been profound : while a man is himself shallow , how should his love be deep !
Parsing [sent. 4034 len. 23]: I saw that we had each loved our elder brother in a truer and better fashion than we had loved each other .
Parsing [sent. 4035 len. 28]: One of the chief active bonds between us had been fun ; another , habit ; and another , constitutional resemblance -- not one of them strong .
Parsing [sent. 4036 len. 21]: Underneath were bonds far stronger , but they had never come into conscious play ; no strain had reached them .
Parsing [sent. 4037 len. 42]: They were there , I say ; for wherever is the poorest flower of love , it is there in virtue of the perfect root of love ; and love 's root must one day blossom into love 's perfect rose .
Parsing [sent. 4038 len. 35]: My chief consolation under the burden of my guilt is , that I love my brother since I killed him , far more than I loved him when we were all to each other .
Parsing [sent. 4039 len. 18]: Had we never quarrelled , and were he alive , I should not be loving him thus !
Parsing [sent. 4040 len. 28]: `` That we shall meet again , and live in the devotion of a far deeper love , I feel in the very heart of my soul .
Parsing [sent. 4041 len. 21]: That it is my miserable need that has wrought in me this confidence , is no argument against the confidence .
Parsing [sent. 4042 len. 19]: As misery alone sees miracles , so is there many a truth into which misery alone can enter .
Parsing [sent. 4043 len. 22]: My little one , do not pity your uncle much ; I have learned to lift up my heart to God .
Parsing [sent. 4044 len. 41]: I look to him who is the saviour of men to deliver me from blood-guiltiness -- to lead me into my brother 's pardon , and enable me somehow to make up to him for the wrong I did him .
Parsing [sent. 4045 len. 13]: `` Some would think I ought to give myself up to justice .
Parsing [sent. 4046 len. 20]: But I felt and feel that I owe my brother reparation , not my country the opportunity of retribution .
Parsing [sent. 4047 len. 27]: It can not be demanded of me to pretermit , because of my crime , the duty more strongly required of me because of the crime .
Parsing [sent. 4048 len. 16]: Must I not use my best endeavour to turn aside its evil consequences from others ?
Parsing [sent. 4049 len. 34]: Was I , were it even for the cleansing of my vile soul , to leave the child of my brother alone with a property exposing her to the machinations of prowling selfishness !
Parsing [sent. 4050 len. 33]: Would it atone for the wrong of depriving her of one uncle , to take the other from her , and so leave her defenceless with a burden she could not carry ?
Parsing [sent. 4051 len. 23]: Must I take so-called justice on myself at her expense -- to the oppression , darkening , and endangering of her life ?
Parsing [sent. 4052 len. 19]: Were I accused , I would tell the truth ; but I would not volunteer a phantasmal atonement .
Parsing [sent. 4053 len. 13]: What comfort would it be to my brother that I was hanged ?
Parsing [sent. 4054 len. 28]: Let the punishment God pleased come upon me , I said ; as far as lay in me , I would live for my brother 's child !
Parsing [sent. 4055 len. 6]: I have lived for her .
Parsing [sent. 4056 len. 33]: `` But I am , and have been , and shall , I trust , throughout my earthly time , and what time thereafter may be needful , always be in Purgatory .
Parsing [sent. 4057 len. 20]: I should tremble at the thought of coming out of it a moment ere it had done its part .
Parsing [sent. 4058 len. 44]: `` One day , after my return home , as I unpacked a portmanteau , my fingers slipped into the pocket of a waistcoat , and came upon something which , when I brought it to the light , proved a large ruby .
Parsing [sent. 4059 len. 7]: A pang went to my heart .
Parsing [sent. 4060 len. 30]: I looked at the waistcoat , and found it the one I had worn that terrible night : the ruby was the stone of the ring Edmund always wore .
Parsing [sent. 4061 len. 14]: It must have been loose , and had got there in our struggle .
Parsing [sent. 4062 len. 12]: Every now and then I am drawn to look at it .
Parsing [sent. 4063 len. 17]: At first I saw in it only the blood ; now I see the light also .
Parsing [sent. 4064 len. 15]: The moon of hope rises higher as the sun of life approaches the horizon .
Parsing [sent. 4065 len. 13]: `` I was never questioned about the death of my twin brother .
Parsing [sent. 4066 len. 11]: One , of two so like , must seem enough .
Parsing [sent. 4067 len. 58]: Our resemblance , I believe , was a bore , which the teasing use we made of it aggravated ; therefore the fact that there was no longer a pair of us , could not be regarded as cause for regret , and things quickly settled down to the state in which you so long knew them .
Parsing [sent. 4068 len. 17]: If there be one with a suspicion of the terrible truth , it is cousin Martha .
Parsing [sent. 4069 len. 17]: `` You will not be surprised that you should never have heard of your uncle Edmund .
Parsing [sent. 4070 len. 24]: `` I dare not ask you , my child , not to love me less ; for perhaps you ought to do so .
Parsing [sent. 4071 len. 26]: If you do , I have my consolation in the fact that my little one can not make me love _ her _ less . ''
Parsing [sent. 4072 len. 28]: Thus ended the manuscript , signed with my uncle 's name and address in full , and directed to me at the bottom of the last page .
Parsing [sent. 4073 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXXV .
Parsing [sent. 4074 len. 5]: UNCLE EDMUND 'S APPENDIX .
Parsing [sent. 4075 len. 50]: When my uncle Edward had told his story , corresponding , though more conversational in form , with that I have now transcribed , my uncle Edmund took up his part of the tale from the moment when he came to himself after their fearful rush down the river .
Parsing [sent. 4076 len. 17]: It was to this effect : He lay on the very verge of the hideous void .
Parsing [sent. 4077 len. 17]: How it was that he got thus far and no farther , he never could think .
Parsing [sent. 4078 len. 35]: He was out of the central channel , and the water that ran all about him and poured immediately over the edge of the precipice , could not have sufficed to roll him there .
Parsing [sent. 4079 len. 47]: Finding himself on his back , and trying to turn on his side in order to rise , his elbow found no support , and lifting his head a little , he looked down into a moon-pervaded abyss , where thin silvery vapours were stealing about .
Parsing [sent. 4080 len. 47]: One turn , and he would have been on his way , plumb-down , to the valley below -- say , rather , on his way off the face of the world into the vast that bosoms the stars and the systems and the cloudy worlds .
Parsing [sent. 4081 len. 7]: His very soul quivered with terror .
Parsing [sent. 4082 len. 28]: The pang of it was so keen that it saved him from the swoon in which he might yet have dropped from the edge of the world .
Parsing [sent. 4083 len. 53]: Not daring to rise , and unable to roll himself up the slight slope , he shifted himself sideways along the ground , inch by inch , for a few yards , then rose , and ran staggering away , as from a monster that might wake and pursue and overtake him .
Parsing [sent. 4084 len. 46]: He doubted if he would ever have recovered the sudden shock of his awful position , of his one glance into the ghastly depth , but for the worse horror of the all-but-conviction that his brother had gone down to Hades through that terrible descent .
Parsing [sent. 4085 len. 27]: If only he too had gone , he cried in his misery , they would now be together , with no wicked woman between their hearts !
Parsing [sent. 4086 len. 9]: For his love too was changed into loathing .
Parsing [sent. 4087 len. 17]: He too was at once , and entirely , and for ever freed from her fascination .
Parsing [sent. 4088 len. 10]: The very thought of her was hateful to him .
Parsing [sent. 4089 len. 20]: With straight course , but wavering walk , he made his way through the moonlight to demand his brother .
Parsing [sent. 4090 len. 13]: He too picked up the handkerchief , and dropped it with disgust .
Parsing [sent. 4091 len. 17]: What followed in the lady 's chamber , I have already given in his own words .
Parsing [sent. 4092 len. 15]: When he fled from the chalet , it was with self-slaughter in his heart .
Parsing [sent. 4093 len. 26]: But he endured in the comfort of the thought that the door of death was always open , that he might enter when he would .
Parsing [sent. 4094 len. 32]: He sought the foot of the fall the same night ; then , as one possessed of demons to the tombs , fled to the solitary places of the dark mountains .
Parsing [sent. 4095 len. 8]: He went through many a sore stress .
Parsing [sent. 4096 len. 32]: Ignorant of the death of his father and his elder brother , the dread misery of encountering them with his brother 's blood on his soul , barred his way home .
Parsing [sent. 4097 len. 17]: He could not bear the thought of reading in their eyes his own horror of himself .
Parsing [sent. 4098 len. 23]: His money was soon spent , and for months he had to endure severe hardships -- of simple , wholesome human sort .
Parsing [sent. 4099 len. 21]: He thought afterward that , if he had had no trouble of that kind , his brain would have yielded .
Parsing [sent. 4100 len. 25]: He would have surrendered himself but for the uselessness of it , and the misery and public stare it would bring upon his family .
Parsing [sent. 4101 len. 49]: Knowing German well , and contriving at length to reach Berlin , he found employment there of various kinds , and for a good many years managed to live as well as he had any heart for , and spare a little for some worse off than himself .
Parsing [sent. 4102 len. 34]: Having no regard to his health , however , he had at length a terrible attack of brain-fever , and but partially recovering his faculties after it , was placed in an asylum .
Parsing [sent. 4103 len. 50]: There he dreamed every night of his home , came awake with the joy of the dream , and could sleep no more for longing -- not to go home -- that he dared not think of -- but to look upon the place , if only once again .
Parsing [sent. 4104 len. 8]: The longing grew till it became intolerable .
Parsing [sent. 4105 len. 25]: By his talk in his sleep , the good people about him learning his condition , gave and gathered money to send him home .
Parsing [sent. 4106 len. 29]: On his way , he came to himself quite , but when he reached England , he found he dared not go near the place of his birth .
Parsing [sent. 4107 len. 17]: He remained therefore in London , where he made the barest livelihood by copying legal documents .
Parsing [sent. 4108 len. 24]: In this way he spent a few miserable years , and then suddenly set out to walk to the house of his fathers .
Parsing [sent. 4109 len. 15]: He had but five shillings in his possession when the impulse came upon him .
Parsing [sent. 4110 len. 54]: He reached the moor , and had fallen exhausted , when a solitary gypsy , rare phenomenon , I presume , with a divine spot awake in his heart , found him , gave him some gin , and took him to a hut he had in the wildest part of the heath .
Parsing [sent. 4111 len. 13]: He lay helpless for a week , and then began to recover .
Parsing [sent. 4112 len. 36]: When he was sufficiently restored , he helped his host to weave the baskets which , as soon as he had enough to make a load , he took about the country in a cart .
Parsing [sent. 4113 len. 29]: He soon became so clever at the work as quite to earn his food and shelter , making more baskets while the gypsy was away selling the others .
Parsing [sent. 4114 len. 35]: At home , the old horse managed to live , or rather not to die , on the moor , and , all things considered , had not a very hard life of it .
Parsing [sent. 4115 len. 47]: On his back , uncle Edmund , ill able to walk so far -- for he was anything but strong now , would sometimes go wandering in the twilight , or when the moon shone , to some spot whence he could see his old home .
Parsing [sent. 4116 len. 22]: Occasionally he would even go round and round the house while we slept , like a ghost dreaming of ancient days .
Parsing [sent. 4117 len. 59]: `` But , '' I said , interrupting his narrative , `` the horseman I saw that night in the storm could not have been you , uncle ; for the horse was a grand creature , rearing like the horse with Peter the Great on his back , in the corner of the map of Russia ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4118 len. 11]: `` Were _ you _ out that terrible night ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4119 len. 3]: he returned .
Parsing [sent. 4120 len. 16]: `` The lightning was enough to frighten even an older horse than the gypsy 's .
Parsing [sent. 4121 len. 10]: -- I wonder how my friend is getting on !
Parsing [sent. 4122 len. 7]: He must think me very ungrateful !
Parsing [sent. 4123 len. 12]: But I daresay he imagines me lying fathom-deep in the bog .
Parsing [sent. 4124 len. 15]: -- You will do something for him , wo n't you , Ed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4125 len. 27]: `` You shall do for him yourself what you please , Ed , '' answered my own uncle , `` and I will help you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4126 len. 37]: `` But , uncle Edmund , '' I said , `` if it was you we saw , the place you were in was a very boggy one always , and nearly a lake then ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4127 len. 10]: `` I thought I should never get out ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4128 len. 3]: he replied .
Parsing [sent. 4129 len. 17]: `` But for the poor horse and his owner , I should not have minded . ''
Parsing [sent. 4130 len. 14]: `` How _ did _ you get out of it , uncle ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4131 len. 3]: I persisted .
Parsing [sent. 4132 len. 13]: `` Lady Cairnedge smothered a splendid black horse not far from there .
Parsing [sent. 4133 len. 9]: Through the darkness I heard him going down .
Parsing [sent. 4134 len. 12]: It makes me shudder every time I think of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4135 len. 9]: `` I can not tell you , child .
Parsing [sent. 4136 len. 16]: I suppose my gray was such a skeleton that the bog could n't hold him .
Parsing [sent. 4137 len. 19]: I left it all to him , and he got himself and me too out of it somehow .
Parsing [sent. 4138 len. 16]: It was too dark , as you know , to see anything between the flashes .
Parsing [sent. 4139 len. 9]: I remember we were pretty deep sometimes . ''
Parsing [sent. 4140 len. 20]: He went back to London after that , and had come and gone once or twice , he said .
Parsing [sent. 4141 len. 11]: When he came he always lodged with his gypsy friend .
Parsing [sent. 4142 len. 28]: He had learned that his father was dead , but took the Mr. Whichcote he heard mentioned , for his elder brother , David , my father .
Parsing [sent. 4143 len. 50]: I asked him how it was he appeared to such purpose , and in the very nick of time , that afternoon when lady Cairnedge had come with her servants to carry John away ; for of course I knew now that our champion must have been uncle Edmund .
Parsing [sent. 4144 len. 33]: He answered he had that very morning made up his mind to present himself at the house , and had walked there for the purpose , resolved to tell his brother all .
Parsing [sent. 4145 len. 44]: He got in by the end of the garden , as John was in the way of doing , and had reached the little grove of firs by the house , when he saw a carriage at the door , and drew back .
Parsing [sent. 4146 len. 46]: Hearing then the noises of attack and defence , he came to the window and looked in , heard lady Cairnedge 's shriek , saw her on the floor , and the men attempting to force an entrance at the other side of the window .
Parsing [sent. 4147 len. 15]: Hardly knowing what he did , he rushed at them and beat them off .
Parsing [sent. 4148 len. 25]: Then suddenly turning faint , for his heart was troublesome , he retired into the grove , and lay there helpless for a time .
Parsing [sent. 4149 len. 15]: He recovered only to hear the carriage drive away , leaving quiet behind it .
Parsing [sent. 4150 len. 18]: To see that woman in the house of his fathers , was a terrible shock to him .
Parsing [sent. 4151 len. 9]: Could it be that David had married her ?
Parsing [sent. 4152 len. 17]: He stole from his covert , and crawled across the moor to the gypsy 's hut .
Parsing [sent. 4153 len. 30]: There he was consoled by learning that the mistress of the house was a young girl , whom he rightly concluded to be the daughter of his brother David .
Parsing [sent. 4154 len. 35]: In making a second visit with the same intent , he had another attack of the heart , and now knew that he would have died in the snow had not John found him .
Parsing [sent. 4155 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXXVI .
Parsing [sent. 4156 len. 7]: THE END OF THE FIRST VOLUME .
Parsing [sent. 4157 len. 8]: We returned to England the next day .
Parsing [sent. 4158 len. 35]: All the journey through , my uncles were continually reverting to the matter of John 's parentage : the more they saw of him , the less could they believe lady Cairnedge his mother .
Parsing [sent. 4159 len. 57]: Through questions put to him , and inquiries afterward made , they discovered that , when he went to London , he had gone to lady Cairnedge 's lawyer , not his father 's , of whom he had never heard -- which accounted for his having on that occasion learned nothing of consequence to him .
Parsing [sent. 4160 len. 35]: When we reached London , my uncle Edmund , who , having been bred a lawyer , knew how to act , went at once to examine the will left by John 's father .
Parsing [sent. 4161 len. 14]: That done , he set out for the place where John was born .
Parsing [sent. 4162 len. 7]: The rest of us went home .
Parsing [sent. 4163 len. 12]: The second day after our arrival there , uncle Edmund came .
Parsing [sent. 4164 len. 29]: He had found perfect proof , not only that lady Cairnedge was John 's step-mother , but that she had no authority over him or his property whatever .
Parsing [sent. 4165 len. 39]: A long discussion took place in my uncles ' study -- I have to shift the apostrophe of possession -- as to whether John ought to compel restitution of what she might have wrongfully spent or otherwise appropriated .
Parsing [sent. 4166 len. 53]: She had been left an income by each of her husbands , upon either of which incomes she might have lived at ease ; but they had a strong suspicion , soon entirely justified , that while spending John 's money , she had been saving up far more than her own .
Parsing [sent. 4167 len. 39]: But in the discussion , John held to it that , as she had once been the wife of his father , he would spare her so far -- provided she had nowise impoverished either of the estates .
Parsing [sent. 4168 len. 9]: He would insist only upon her immediate departure .
Parsing [sent. 4169 len. 40]: `` Yes , little one , '' said my uncle , one summer evening , as he and I talked together , seated alone in the wilderness , `` what we call misfortune is always the only good fortune .
Parsing [sent. 4170 len. 22]: Few will say _ yes _ in response , but Truth is independent of supporters , being justified by her children .
Parsing [sent. 4171 len. 42]: `` Until _ misfortune _ found us , '' he went on , `` my brother and I had indeed loved one another , but with a love so poor that a wicked woman was able to send it to sleep .
Parsing [sent. 4172 len. 32]: To what she might have brought us , had she had full scope , God only knows : _ now _ all the women in hell could not separate us ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4173 len. 14]: `` And all the women in paradise would but bring you closer ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4174 len. 5]: I ventured to add .
Parsing [sent. 4175 len. 43]: The day after our marriage , which took place within a month of our return from Paris , John went to Rising , on a visit to lady Cairnedge of anything but ceremony , and took his uncles and myself with him .
Parsing [sent. 4176 len. 24]: `` Will you tell her ladyship , '' he said to the footman , `` that Mr. Day desires to see her . ''
Parsing [sent. 4177 len. 34]: The man would have shut the door in our faces , with the words , `` I will see if my lady is at home ; '' but John was prepared for him .
Parsing [sent. 4178 len. 30]: He put his foot between the door and the jamb , and his two hands against the door , driving it to the wall with the man behind it .
Parsing [sent. 4179 len. 49]: There he held him till we were all in , then closed the door , and said to him , in a tone I had never heard him use till that moment , `` Let lady Cairnedge know at once that Mr. Day desires to see her . ''
Parsing [sent. 4180 len. 4]: The man went .
Parsing [sent. 4181 len. 26]: We walked into the white drawing-room , the same where I sat alone among the mirrors the morning after I was lost on the moor .
Parsing [sent. 4182 len. 6]: How well I remembered it !
Parsing [sent. 4183 len. 4]: There we waited .
Parsing [sent. 4184 len. 24]: The gentlemen stood , but , John insisting , I sat -- my eyes fixed on the door by which we had entered .
Parsing [sent. 4185 len. 24]: In a few minutes , however , a slight sound in another part of the room , caused me to turn them thitherward .
Parsing [sent. 4186 len. 26]: There stood lady Cairnedge , in a riding-habit , with a whip in her hand , staring , pale as death , at my uncles .
Parsing [sent. 4187 len. 32]: Then , with a scornful laugh , she turned and went through a door immediately behind her , which closed instantly , and became part of the wainscot , hardly distinguishable .
Parsing [sent. 4188 len. 5]: John darted to it .
Parsing [sent. 4189 len. 7]: It was bolted on the outside .
Parsing [sent. 4190 len. 18]: He sought another door , and ran hither and thither through the house to find the woman .
Parsing [sent. 4191 len. 12]: My uncles ran after him , afraid something might befall him .
Parsing [sent. 4192 len. 10]: I remained where I was , far from comfortable .
Parsing [sent. 4193 len. 15]: Two or three minutes passed , and then I heard the thunder of hoofs .
Parsing [sent. 4194 len. 6]: I ran to the window .
Parsing [sent. 4195 len. 27]: There she was , tearing across the park at full gallop , on just such a huge black horse as she had smothered in the bog !
Parsing [sent. 4196 len. 23]: I was the only one of us that saw her , and not one of us ever set eyes upon her again .
Parsing [sent. 4197 len. 49]: When we went over the house , it soon became plain to us that she had been in readiness for a sudden retreat , having prepared for it after a fashion of her own : not a single small article of value was to be discovered in it .
Parsing [sent. 4198 len. 46]: John 's great-aunt , who left him the property , died in the house , possessed of a large number of jewels , many of them of great price both in themselves and because of their antiquity : not one of them was ever found .
Parsing [sent. 4199 len. 23]: A report reached us long after , that lady Cairnedge was found dead in her bed in a hotel in the Tyrol .
Parsing [sent. 4200 len. 11]: My uncles lived for many years on the old farm .
Parsing [sent. 4201 len. 21]: Uncle Edmund bought a gray horse , as like uncle Edward 's as he could find one , only younger .
Parsing [sent. 4202 len. 27]: I often wondered what Death must think -- to know he had his master on his back , and yet see him mounted by his side .
Parsing [sent. 4203 len. 20]: Every day one or the other , most days both , would ride across the moor to see us .
Parsing [sent. 4204 len. 15]: For many years Martha walked in at the door at least once every week .
Parsing [sent. 4205 len. 21]: My uncles took no pains , for they had no desire , to be distinguished the one from the other .
Parsing [sent. 4206 len. 12]: Each was always ready to meet any obligation of the other .
Parsing [sent. 4207 len. 20]: If one made an appointment , few could tell which it was , and nobody which would keep it .
Parsing [sent. 4208 len. 55]: No one could tell , except , perhaps , one who had been present , which of them had signed any document : their two hands were absolutely indistinguishable , I do not believe either of them , after a time , always himself knew whether the name was his or his brother 's .
Parsing [sent. 4209 len. 16]: He could only be always certain it must have been written by one of them .
Parsing [sent. 4210 len. 13]: But each indifferently was ready to honour the signature , _ Ed .
Parsing [sent. 4211 len. 3]: Whichcote _ .
Parsing [sent. 4212 len. 9]: They died within a month of each other .
Parsing [sent. 4213 len. 7]: Their bodies lie side by side .
Parsing [sent. 4214 len. 35]: On their one tombstone is the inscription : HERE LIE THE DISUSED GARMENTS OF EDWARD AND EDMUND WHICHCOTE , BORN FEB. 29 , 1804 ; DIED JUNE 30 , AND JULY 28 , 1864 .
Parsing [sent. 4215 len. 9]: THEY ARE NOT HERE ; THEY ARE RISEN .
Parsing [sent. 4216 len. 6]: John and I are waiting .
Parsing [sent. 4217 len. 3]: Belorba Day .
